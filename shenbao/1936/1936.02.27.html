<h3 id="c19">日本大政變之觀測 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>阢陧不寗之日本政局今竟發生劇變矣消息傳來頗令吾人震駭此决政變其嚴重性迪非五。一五事伴所可比擬前途如何發展殊難逆料但就以往日本政局一加考察亦可略知此次政變之幾項意義請分述之</p>
<p>第一自九一八事變以來日本少壯軍人因對外侵略逐步勝利氣熖驟盛甚至欲奪取全部政權故先則造成五一五事件今又擴大而釀成此决巨變五一五事伴爲少壯軍人團體對議會政治之猛烈的攻擊而此决事變則爲政黨中之急進份子聯合右翼軍人團體對元老重臣及政黨中穩健份子之决戰易詞言之亦卽法西斯勢力與封建貴族及產業資本家勢力消長之重耍關鍵</p>
<p>第二此决事變之醞釀雖非一日但促進此一政變之最近原因以吾入瞰測的有數端　最近總選舉之結果民政黨大獲勝利岡田內閣地位轉形穩固與日本少壯軍人耍求岡田內閣立卽掛冠之願望適成相反且此决總選舉中有一特殊現象卽舊官僚貴族勢力加緊聯合而在「舉國一致協力」口號之下壓制少壯軍人　去年七月間所發生之永田被殺事伴爲日本在鄉軍人對軍部穩重派之一嚴重警吿此事迄今仍未解决而情形已更趨複雜化少壯派軍人領袖眞崎大將於本月二十五日出庭爲永田事件公判作證人時因法官所問涉及職務上秘密而拒絕答辯忿然退庭惟辯護人方面必欲眞崎究明眞相而政府方面亦有溝究之意嚮　最近日蘇關係緊張日本軍部少壯派與外務省及元老重臣意見顯成對立形勢少壯派軍人之意對俄不辭一戰而外務省及元老重臣方面則對日蘇關係認爲必須設法使其緩和少壯派軍人遂以岡田內閣爲柔弱無能非推翻不可　以天皇機關說成爲軍部各派攻擊目標之美濃部博士於本月二十一日被刺未死兇手被逮自認與右翼暴力軍人團體有關有此四因而昨日之鉅大政變乃促成矣</p>
<p>抑此决政變以高橋財相與岡田首相爲暗殺之主耍對象亦有其重要之原因在吾人素知軍部方面力倡海陸軍健全論主張儘量擴充軍備而高橋財相則爲反對軍事預算無限膨脹之有力人物頗得日本工商界與金融界之擁護至岡田首相雖爲軍人出身而其政策實與元老重臣一致組閣以來對右翼軍人團體抑制頗力截至去年八月末爲止暴力團體被捕人員先後已達二萬餘人（據華聯社消息）右翼軍人團體之銜恨固由來久矣</p>
<p>此决政變其原因旣極複雜其影嚮於日本政治者自必重大而日後之演變在整個中日關係上允將有顯著之反映此吾人所不可不注意者也</p>

<h3 id="c20">佛蘭亭演說　擁護法俄協定　集體安全維持和平　絕非軍事同盟性質　歡迎德國參加合作 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>巴黎法外長佛蘭亭今日在衆院發光明之演說、擁護法俄互助恊定、謂此恊定非軍事聯盟、唯爲確認洛迦諾公的及爲達到和平之大路上一階段耳、佛氏演說畢、左翼各黨之全體與中央黨之大部份均熱烈歡呼、新故該協定明日經衆院表决時、必予通過無疑、惟外長未能轉移右翼各黨之反對、右翼各黨不殊以與莫斯科作任何密切聯合爲然、彼等輕視蘇之軍事實力、且不欲向德國作無謂之挑釁、惟外長曾稱、渠擬將該協定是吾符合洛迦諾公的問題提交海牙法庭裁斷、以故遂獲得勝利、</p>
<p>佛氏演說之初、謂該恊定一經通過、可鞏個歐洲集體安全之組織、法國對於志在保衛和平之諒解、從未放棄邀德國參加之志願、歷來各政府皆忠於此觀念、而常謹愼使德國之地德開放、該協定不含有可在聯盟條的中覓得之義務、並不違反洛迦加諾公的之精神、該協定實確認洛迦諾公的、並聲明不得對德侵略、該協定僅圖對侵者作抵抗耳、佛氏繼引述政府之言、宣並言及與德人之合作、其結語曰、「文化對之有負實多之一大國、應復在世界中處平等地位、此固吾人所願也、」（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎本日午後三時衆議院開會、繼績辯論法俄互助條的批准案、外長佛蘭亭以連日衆院會議席、上對本條的發言批評者不一而、足乃於本日之會、席親自出表演說、予總以答復、演詞甚長、歷二小時始畢、其扼要之語、謂「簽字於法俄互助條的、爲吾固有之權利、萬一德國正式以吾認吾人此項權利、則吾人將此問題提交海牙國際常設法庭、聽候裁一篇大意謂、自一九二零年以來、法國政府判」、全所持之政策、由集體安全之途徑向維持和平之目標以邁進、蓋以集體安全者、亦卽國聯會所懸之鵠的也、歷届政府雖有嬗易、而此項政策始終不變、至與法俄互家莫不報助條的、則除德國之外、一切國之以同情態度、良以此項條約、並不軼出國聯會機械之外、而又公開聽任各國加入、且本條的之兩簽字國業經同意、凡國聯會所可提出之建議案、均當加以遵守故與歐戰前之攻守同盟、實不能相提並論、若一般批抨者謂一旦東歐事有秋、法國受此條的之約束、勢將牽入漩渦、則答之曰、當一九一四大戰之始起也、爆發之動機、初與吾人風馬牛不相及、（指奧國皇太子被戕之事而言）其後英駐意等國若均持自私與孤立之主張、則均袖手旁視、不加入吾國方面可也、是則訂立互助條約與牽入戰爭漩渦、初不能混爲一談也」、</p>
<p>佛蘭亭所作結論允爲動聽、要求各議員勿將國內政制問題、與外政策羼雜爲一、譬興意大利政制與蘇維埃政制背道而馳、然意俄兩國邦交輯睦、固昭昭明甚也云　」（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>頃據熟悉政情者、觀察衆院情勢、謂衆院表决本案之時、贊成票數雖恐不逮歷决贊成政府外交政策者之多、但必佔多數、自無疑義、大抵衆院將於星期四日表决通過批准案、卽行咨送參議院、而參院之中反覆辯論、亦須經過相當時日、然則法俄互助條約未必能在三月三日之前獲得參衆兩院之批准、屆時衆議改選期近、本屆會期卽將結束、如是轉輾延緩、結果所屆、法國與其他諸國對於本條院之立塲、或將發生變化亦未可知也、（二十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>倫敦今日此間各報大書特書、謂因法俄互助恊定及英法進行對意制裁政策之結果、歐洲列强有畫定新分野之可能、各報兼有羅馬傳來之謠言、謂墨索里尼與駐意德大使哈賽爾會談後、已獲妥協、如法俄互助協定經法衆院通過、意德當取共同對付行動、一般印象以爲德意奧匈波蘭五國之集團、刻正在羅馬組合中、羅馬意當局與外交界均承認極關重要之秘密談判、刻正在進行中、聞哈賽爾與墨氏會談後、駐羅馬波蘭大使卽晉謁墨氏而忽遽返國、上週與奧外長在佛洛倫斯會談之意外决蘇維志、現擬報聘匈京、故自意阿開戰後不注重歐事之意國外交、現復在充分活動中、衆信墨氏現圖使各國感覺如斯特萊薩陣錢一旦破裂、則必有慘烈之後果隨之俱來、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦美聯社今日自可靠方面得悉、英國曾非正式建議，倘倫敦海軍會議失敗、則由英美德三國締結海軍協定、據稱此項建議、係英國不滿法意代表提出歐洲政治問題之結果、今日美國代表拒絕討論彼等對於該項建議之感想、倘英美德三國成立協定、自當互換文伴、並預留將來會議之地步、而日俄兩國、或可被邀參加云、（二十五日國民電）</p>

<p>— 邵士平</p>
<p>四川的土地關係與稅捐</p>
<p>四川在人們的觀念中，終覺得是一個混亂的世界，或神秘的地方，從來很少人去注意它。自從「赤匪」竄入，隨着大軍進剿，跟着開發四川的聲浪也高起來，更配合着丁文江先生「退到中國的堪察加（指四川，雲貴）去」的高論，於是四川被大家注意了。</p>
<p>四川是內地十八省最大的一區，各種生產方式都殘存着：如松潘，俄國羅邊等地，還過着游牧生活。川西南邊境，許多地方還有民族經濟的遺蹟。而重慶已充分表現出資本主義的萌芽。但就大部分而說，則逗遛在半封建的農村經濟上。本文所叙述的，也只是這一部分</p>
<p>據國府主計處的統計，全省田地面積共的九六，二七二，〇〇〇畝，土壤肥沃，稻，菽，蔬菓，烟，茶，蔴，棉等，都有很大的出產。全省粳稻面積的四一，五一五，〇〇〇畝，能產米一三二，四五一，五三〇祖（百斤）。糯稻面積四，三三二，〇○○畝，能產米一二，九二四，二九〇担。大荳約可產九百萬担，棉花的六十萬担，其他各項之生產量，也是很大，因此稱它爲「天富」，確是「名實相符」。但是從民國以來，川內養兵四十多萬，軍閥火併，大小四百七十多戰，在這過程中半封建的生產關係起着有力的作用，苛捐雜稅，高額地租，重利盤剝，益形猖獗。水旱兵匪的災害，更加速了農村經濟的崩潰。農民在這重重因迫之中，除了失地，逃亡，飢餓之外，沒有第二條路，而另一方面地權却在集中起來，於是釀成了一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>一，土地的集中過程</p>
<p>我們來觀察四川地權集中到如何程度是一件很饒興味的事。但是在目前一方面沒有適當的統計資料。另一方面「四川軍人全是大地主」，這是我們聽慣了的，例如楊森，鄧錫侯等等，沒有一個不是「地連阡陌，田隔數縣」。他們的財產「富可敵國」。劉湘等不是還有自己的銀行嗎？自然他們的土地也無從調査。一般說來，川地有百分之七十以上爲地主佔有，這大的不會離事實太遠。例如一個比較富庶的長壽縣，地主富農的戶數只佔百分之一五，佔有的十地竟有百分之七八：貧農的戶數有百分之六五·九，而佔有土地僅僅百分之八左右。</p>
<p>地主和富農，特別在四川是不便分開的。因爲它們往往兼爲一體。並且四川也並無大規模租佃經營的富農，所以我們把它併在一起計算。在這裏我們很可以看出，佔全農戶最少（百分之一五，七）的地主和富農，佔有土地將近十分之八。而入數最多的貧農（百分之六五，九），所有土地還不到十分之一。地權集中的深度，可以想見了。</p>
<p>巴縣二十三年調査二，七六三，家村戶的統計，雖則不十分精確，但也能吿訴我們同樣的結果。據這决統計，百畝以上地主有一七一戶（不到百分之七）。其中千畝以上的大地主三戶，五百畝以上的六六戶，二百畝以上的五七戶。其他五十畝以土的九四戶二十畝以上的三四八戶，十畝以上的三五〇戶。十畝以下的却有一五〇〇戶，幾佔總村戶十分之六，而其中最可憐的不足五畝的貧農竟有一，一一〇戶。在四川目前的生產狀况之下，普通有田地二十畝的村戶，一家八口，僅足自給。而現今在重慶附近的巴縣，不足十畝的竟達十分之六，自然他們都是無以自給的貧農了。</p>
<p>然而惡劣的情形還不止此。連年內亂和苛征暴斂的結果，農民貧窮的程度，還在一天天深刻化。起初，他們出賣穀物，典當衣飾和家具來應付，最後不得不典押或出賣它唯一的生產手段—土地，來塡塞軍閥和地主的慾壑，於是當他們一天天跑上無地化的路去，而地權相反的在加速的繼續集中起來。我們只要看自耕農一年年的减少，而佃農一年年的增加，就可以把這個事實完全暴露出來了。</p>
<p>四川佃農，自耕農消長表（見中央農業實騐所農情報吿）</p>
<p>年份　佃農％　自耕　半自耕</p>
<p>農％　農％</p>
<p>民國元年　五十一　三十　十九</p>
<p>民國二十年　五十六　二十五　十九</p>
<p>民國二十一年　五十八　二十三　十九</p>
<p>民國二十二年　五十九　二十二　十九</p>
<p>可見除半自耕農沒有任何變動外，佃農的成份正在年年增加，自耕農却在一年减少一年。據另一統計（見東方雜誌二四卷十六號）川北佃農，在民國元年僅佔總農戶百分之二十八，到民十三年，增爲百分之三五。到現在就算百分之五十吧！（照中央農業實騐所的統計是百分之五十九）那末它增加的速度實是驚人，但無論如何，在這要正證明兩極化的程度正在開展。同時我們還需指明半自耕農所以沒有變動，並不是因爲他們的境遇特別好，事實上他們也在向着無地化的路上去，只是因爲自耕農的沒落，使他們所佔的比重，沒有多大變化罷了！</p>
<p>二，租佃關係</p>
<p>上面已經說過，四川的田地至少有七〇％爲地主所佔有，而佃農的成份又在六〇％上下。然而這許多佃農决不能與歐美大規模租佃經營的農業資本家相比。無疑的他們是在零細土地上討生活。永佃制和契的租佃同時存在。租額之高，迫使佃農生活日趨惡劣。現在且看巴縣的情形。</p>
<p>巴縣佃農納租之租率及租額（二十三年調査）</p>
<p>平常產量　全年產量　全年錢租　正交附產　納稅附產　押金</p>
<p>上田　十八斗　十斗　十七元　七成　二元　十元</p>
<p>中田　十五斗　八斗五升　十元　六成　一·五元　八元</p>
<p>下田　十四斗　八斗　五元　五成　八角　六元</p>
<p>巴縣迫近大都會重慶市，然而農村中地租之高，簡直難於置信，最低也需五成，高的竟在七成以上。佃農的生產品，非但剩餘價値部分完全給地主佔有，並且連工資部分也被剝奪了，誰還能承認這是資本主義地租呢？</p>
<p>我們再舉出榮縣來看看它的租佃情形。</p>
<p>一，錢租—旱田每畝年納三元，圍圃四元。</p>
<p>二，物租—水田每畝年納一石，旱田二斗。</p>
<p>三，佔收穫額的成數—水田七成，園圃五成，旱田三成。</p>
<p>四，額外之需索—有鷄，鴨，蔬菓等土產，作爲送禮。</p>
<p>五，荒年减租辦法—由佃戶備酒宴請地主査勘，到收租時由地主片面决定，的合主六佃四，或主七佃三。</p>
<p>天哪！地租這樣高了，不算，還要收受鉅額的無利押金；不算，還耍額外送禮；不算，荒年還得請地主吃酒；不算，在許多地方還要替地主做若干日義務勞動；還不算，更要代地主繳納賦稅哩！（例如簡陽的田賦，正糧雖由業主繳納，各種附加則主六佃四，或主佃各半，甚致完全由佃農負担。然而這還是不很壊的。有許多地方連正糧也由佃農繳納。）</p>
<p>此外還有一種剝削方式，無以名之，名之曰「硬敲」。摘錄四川省政府通令一節，藉明眞相：『…民國九年，承佃花蕊祠業（後歸敎育局—作者）安佃（押金—作者）三千二百釧，當時銀元價値，每元易錢二千一二百文，按時價應折合銀元一千四百五十餘元。又十九年續加押二千八百釧，當時每元値錢一十五釧，應折合一百八十六元。本年（二十一年）退佃，敎育局祇退洋四百元，致受一千二百餘元損失：』。這種「硬敲」方式，或在外省的確難得聽到，可是在四川都很普遍。（未完）</p>

<p>— 中央大學地理系教授　黃國璋</p>
<p>以上所講的是偏於理論方面，現在再以日本向海外擴充勢力的地理背景作爲實例來晚明地理知識，對於國際關係的了解，關係是何等的重大！</p>
<p>日本是一個島國與中國距離最近處僅有一日海程，面積雖然不及十五萬方英里，人口郤有六千四百萬，平均每方英里有四百多人，而每方英里耕地面積的人口更有二千五百人左右，人口的稠密也就可想而知了。日本人口不但很是稠密，而且增加得很快，每年增加的數目的在九十萬到百寓之間，而日本既是島國四面爲海洋所包圍，陸地面積無法擴充，因此日本人口問題自來就成爲很嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>解决日本人口問題可能的方法有三：　使本國土地生產能力加强，　從事國內及國外的移民，　謀本國工業的大量發展。現在逐一加以解釋。</p>
<p>擴充農田——凡是平原之地或緩斜的坡地，大都闢成農田，耕種糧食，據專家估計日本尙有可耕的地方的計四五百萬英畝，其中能開闢成爲稻田的的有一半或可供給二千萬人的糧食，換言之，就是可容納日本二十年以內國內增加的人口，但據一九○五——一九二五年的統計，日本平均每年開墾之地不到十萬英畝，這四五百萬英畝的荒地，决不能在二十年以內通通開闢成爲良田，那是無可疑義的。</p>
<p>增加每畝農田的產量——日本農作物品每單位耕地面積的產量確有增加的表示，但是遠不及人口增加的那樣迅速，况且土地的生產有一定的限度，决不能像人口那樣的有增無已。</p>
<p>國內的移民——一·北海道的移民日本本部諸島人口的分佈也不是十分均勻，境內仍多人口過少的地方，像北海道的人口密　僅有令國平均人口密度的五分之一，所以日本政府也曾有計劃的敬勵向北海道移民，但是北海道的氣候很是寒冷，不適於日本中部及南部人民的居住，結果這種計劃是失敗了。二·朝鮮，台灣。庫頁島等處的移民，日本會從我國手裏奪去了不少的土地，而積的當日本本部諸島的百分之六十，朝鮮，台灣就是共中主要的都分。這些地方比北海道要好，氣候與日本中南部大致相同，物產也相差不多，把日本過剩的人口移到這些地方應該是很便易的一件事，可是這些地方的人口本來就很稠密，每方英里在二百一十人以上，臺灣更達三百六十人，而且這些地方的人民生活程度比日本人要低，使得日本人在生活上很不容易同他們相競爭，並且道些地方的人口增加率比日本還高，據一九二五年的統計，日本每千人的增加率爲一三·四人，朝鮮爲二六·一人，台灣爲一八·六人。因爲這種種關係，這些地方每年並不能容納日本多少的移民。朝鮮自隸屬日本以來，平均每年日人的移居數不到一萬五千人，台灣在一九一五年以後，每年平均日人移居的數目更在五千人以下，與日本每年九十萬到百萬人的增加數相比較，實在無補於事。此外日本從俄國人手中奪來庫頁島南部，那裏比北海道更冷，日本人更是裹足不前。歐戰後日本以參戰有功，獲得了太平洋中舊屬德國幾個羣島的管理權，但是這些小島雖有軍事上的價値，實不足以容納日本大量的移民，自代管以來，至今僅有三萬左右的日人居留那些島上。</p>
<p>國外移民——一九三一年日本的國外僑民，總計不過七十五萬人，還不及日本一年內增加的人數，况且這些僑民之中還包括不少的朝鮮人及台灣人以及日本國外留學生，外交官海陸軍人員等在內，正式的國外僑民不過七十萬人左有，與一九二六年六十三萬僑民相比，五年之間增加不過十二萬人，平均每年祇有二萬四千人。這些移民當中有百分之七十是由於日本政府多方的獎勵及南美洲巴西政府的優待到地廣人稀的亞馬遜河流域從事開墾事業的，但是各位曉得亞馬遜河流域是一個如何不適於居住的熱　森林地方，日本移民之不能在這裏大大的發展，這是我們意料所及的。在北美洲的國家，日本人本大可以利用自己生活程度的低下，與白人競爭，但日本人在這些國家不但不受歡迎，而且在限制移人之例，可說是此路不通了。在菲列賓·南洋羣島以及我國的東北一帶，日本人又感着中國人及其他本地人競爭太烈，也非久居之地。由此可知向國內外的移民雖然對於日本人口問題不無小補，但這補助究竟有限，不能不作旁的打算。</p>
<p>（五）發展工業——發展工業直接可以添加國家的財實，間接更可以利用這種財富由國外買入各種生活的資料，容納增加的人口。工業發展比較的沒有止境，乃是解决人口問題最好的辦法，所以日本明治維新以來，也就步着英國的後慶，積極從事工業的發展，到現在居然成效大著，棉織工業的發達僅在英美之决，絲製工業之盛爲全球冠，他如鋼鐵業·造船業·製紙業等都在國際間佔有相當的地位，國內工人數額自一八九四——一九二六年平均每年增加四萬七千人，國家工業化的程度一天一天的來得顯著，時到今日，日本確已成了世上一個重要的工業國家了。</p>
<p>日本工業所以能够發達，原因當然很多，但中日·日俄·歐戰三决大戰却是最大的關鍵：一八九四·一八丸五年中日戰爭的結果，所有對外的不平等條的概行取消，日本民挨性從此伸張，凡百事業從此興起，製造工業也以朝鮮·台灣的獲得，貨品市場原料供給地的廣闢，及政府實行保護關稅政策各種條件之下抬起頭來了。一九〇四年——九〇五年日俄戰爭的結果，使日本一躍而成爲第一等强國，並獲得南滿的經濟權益，國力更見雄厚，工業也日新而月異。一九一四——一九一八年歐洲大戰，日本利用西方的多事，無暇東顧，盡量擴充東方市場，工業上更呈突飛猛進之勢，戰事期內每年平均增加工人達十六七萬，畢竟成爲世界最主要的工業國家之一，這可說日本工業發達的天假良緣。除了對外戰爭勝利以外，他如海外航業的發達，工價的低廉，以及水電事業的興起等，均足以促進日本工業的發展。</p>
<p>日本工業雖然發達得很快，但前進埋伏的危機很多，實在不可樂觀，工人供給雖然不感缺乏，工價也很低廉，但技術上比起歐美來未免見絀，而且國家財富究不算多，每個人平均每年的收入不但是比不上美·英·法·德四國，簡直不到意國的一半，所以國內的購買力很是薄弱。但這些還不算最大的危險，原料的不够供給及力源的感受缺乏，乃是日本工業發展上最大的打擊。鐵鑛儲藏量不多，每年所產還不足以供給自己需要的十分之一，共餘須從朝鮮·中國·馬來半島接濟；棉繳工業所需用的棉花，幾乎全部來自美國·印度·中國等地，本國絕少出品，棉花入口總是佔了日本入口貨物的第一大宗；羊毛也以牧場盡行闢作農場，綿羊極少，自己很少出產；煤與銅要算日本最重要的兩種鑛產，煤的儲藏量雖多，但煤的品質不良，很少可爲煉焦之用；銅的入口量也比出口爲多，石油的埋藏量也是十分缺乏，生產量的爲消費量的十分之一；水力可利用於工業的祗是其中一部分而當江河最低流量之時，水力總量也不過六百萬匹馬力而已，實不足補救這個缺憾。</p>
<p>日本所以促成僞滿洲國的實現，且亟亟於向華北各省擴充勢力的一個原因，是由於華北與東北同是中國的煤鐵合產區域，地利的豐厚，交通的方便，實不下於歐洲來因河流域，乃是遠東將來重工業的中心區域。日本得到東北與華北，一方面可補救他煤鐵缺乏的缺憾，大量的發展重工業，一方面更可使中國全國成爲日本重工業製造品永久的銷場，過剩的產品更可利用低價向世界各處推銷。中國失去了東北及華北，國內重工業的發展，無異宜布絕望，因爲除此兩區以外，中國境內可說我不出第二個煤鐵合產區域，吏找不出第二個煤鐵都很豐富的合產區域。</p>
<p>日本向華北擴充勢力固然由於煤鐵的需耍，同時也是爲棉花原料品的供給，及爲東北剩餘的糧食謀銷路。原來東北各省的農產物品素以黃豆·小麥·高粱·玉米爲大宗，黃豆有世界市場，而小麥·高粱·玉米等，不但沒有國際市場，而且不是日本稠密區域的需要品，日本所需要的是稻米及棉花，而棉花是日本工業的基礎，且爲日本境內所不產，需要更是殷切。東三省生季太短，大部份地方不能種棉，不能供給他全部的需要，而華北地帶的農作物與東北區相同，並且又是一個主要棉花產地，假使在華北大量的種植棉花，不但可以供給他本國紡織業的需求，並且華北所需要的糧食可以由東北供給，而棉花運到大阪經過製造手續以後，更可運回華北與東北，供給人民衣料之所需，實在可稱爲一舉數得之舉。此外日本在東北和華北擴充勢力的另一個原因，就是防止蘇俄勢力之向南迆展，這一點因爲時間有限的關係暫不討論。</p>

<p>寗夏的蒙，回，人民雜處，社會風俗上的禮儀動靜，多具極深宗敎色彩，和漢俗比對，大相殊異，茲分別記其婚喪時令的異俗，以備研考民俗學者參考</p>
<p>蒙俗　驍勇好鬭，是蒙古世系民情的遺傳性，農田自屬不宜，惟是蒙人有着健悍的體格，在黃沙曠漠間東奔西馳的游牧生活，是再合適沒有的了，整天浪游在大自然懐抱中，遇着伺放羊軍駝馬的生活，幔天帳地，餐風宿露，羶腹我幕，逐水草居，因以更需要堅强魄力，所以他們少有生病，簡直羞辱生病，病了也沒醫藥，只有燒石自燙，聽其自然痊愈，他們唯一的信仰，就是寺院裏供奉的佛像和喇嘛僧衆，下面述的，就是關於蒙人的婚娶喪事和每逢歲分對佛敎喇嘛的敬禮，（甲）婚喪，先私會，不由父母，不通媒妁，戀愛是自由極了，但以賽馬賭勝爲定，婚妝亦豐盛，牛羊財物，各自經守，夫婦不和，亦不需多經手續，就地揚士便爾離婚，喪事有天葬火葬，父母旣沒，男女聚哭盡哀，請喇嘛卜葬，天葬的就委屍山林或沙漠次日往覘，被禽獸喫完了，就認爲吉兆，不然却痛哭了，移屍他處，再請喇嘛唸經祝禱，必俟禽獸喫完，纔算免了不祥的完事，火葬的駃屍至山背直坑，傍開竈門，置屍在內，起火焚燒屍身，孝服男女各解散髮辮，衣服拿來反穿，爲期一個月的時間，不上墳，不墓祭，每逢忌日，但請喇嘛唸經祈禱，（乙）時令，「元旦」赴寺中，向喇嘛叩頭，回帳房吃茶役，仍赴寺，繞行寺外十餘周，有病的伏身貼地，行一二周，不賀年請親友吃茶，忌借火給人，十五日，皆赴大喇嘛處摸頂，喇嘛以木竿繫紅布，環身亂擊，被撃着的欣欣然有喜色，未及擊着的在守候着，往往四五天不散，六月十五日，又如前赴大喇嘛處，摸頂和受擊，各寺院裏的喇嘛，正月六月自初一日誦經至十五日，大喇嘛臺上端坐在唸經，對面具着彩服蟒袍顏色各異的三十二人，那是天王菩薩牛頭馬面護法等各形像，在寺中壇上跳着舞着，先頭吹起喇叭號筒，奏了鼓樂，從裏邊迎着他們雙雙兩兩繼着出來，至壇合跳，又用炒麵和酥油，揑做一座赤身人形，放在三角木盤內，下襯三角綢幅，由天王一人，仗小木劍上前支解開了，誦經完畢，又以鼓樂鳴鑼送行，遠出寺外一二里始還，這天寺院執事的收番漢人民布施，過年取河冰列牆上，塊塊相接，「除夕」在房中燒香唸經，沒了父母的，叩首哭泣一番，舉家圍坐吃茶而睡，</p>
<p>回俗　回民勤勞潔凈，不染烟酒惡好，有尙武精神，崇奉回敎，卽「伊斯蘭」敎，「伊斯蘭」的譯意是和平，回敎以「可蘭經」爲最寶貴的經典，可說是回敎的敎憲，亦回敎徒信仰的根據了，茲就寗夏回民婚姻喪葬及時令習俗的特異點，摘要錄下，（甲）婚喪，婚娶不擇貧富，僅選良善人家，使媒妁通言問名籍，立主親，以納聘禮爲定，延敎長書婚，及親迎的前一兩天，女家備嫁妝，遺使往男家舖陳婿室，妝資多寡，率依敎條，家例女得一男之半，親迎成禮，决日，婦出見舅姑，嗣婿亦具禮物，往拜岳家，父母病危，內外止靜，病者正寢，兒男時誦淸眞言，據回敎中人說，這是提覺病者，使心存於道，不繫於世，彌留時，靈魂出體這要緊關頭，不容輕忽的，旣氣絕而沒安位立主喪，延執喪事人等，易服居室，三日不宴客，不治饌，親知僚友，餽食使進，親鄰戚友，具賻往吊，殮服男三件，女四件，俱用細白布，富貴貧賤都是一樣的，治櫝造與，穿壙下葬，不看風水，不擇時日，三日必葬，葬日昧爽，浴亡屍襲殮入柩，遝至敎堂，延掌敎及賓客行殯禮，臨墓，孝子視壙禱後封葬，葬後七日·四十日·百日·周年·三年·及生歿的那天，都行祀禮，以遊墳·誦經·施財·散穀·爲孝親的要道，（乙）時令，回敎以日行一周天，計三百六十五日又四分畫夜之一，算做一歲，以月行十二月計三百五十四日又三分畫夜之一，算做一年，歲以步天時，年以紀人事，所以凡屬典禮，皆以十二月一周計算，回敎篤信造化，天地有一眞主宰，不屬色像，不落空無，至靈至妙，無始無終，實人物性命的大原，而萬有形色所資始的，主要信條，信主·信聖·信天經等，敬事主宰有五功，　「念」，信念不忘眞主，　「禮」，日拜主五决，每禮拜前必凈沐一决，　「齋」，每年封齋一月，每三年一更替，　「課」，課賦濟衆，每年散施一决，　「朝一，朝覲回敎聖地。</p>

<p>國聞社云、上海市銀行公會及錢業公會、自奉財政部訓令、討論减低利息辦法呈復核辦以來、銀行公會小組委員會、已擬具意見、昨並徵求錢業公會意見、聞尚須舉行聯席會議、作具體之决定、俾便呈復核辦、茲將昨日情形分紀如下、</p>
<p>意見一斑　銀行公會小組委員會、經開會討論結果、認為减低利率、有事實上之連鎖關係、茍不澈底解决、絕不能摒棄事實、而空言减低利率也、譬如裁兵公債利息六厘、但以前市塲拍價、每百元恒在八十元左右、則利息便高至七厘以上、今自公債法變更以後、市塲拍價、每百元約六十元之譜、是利息已升至一分左右、此有連鎖關係、亦須連帶解决者一也、又如自去年十一月三日改良幣制以後、中央銀行已形成一銀行界之銀行、茍不先由中央銀行减低利息、並懸牌規定利率、徒以責之商業銀行、是不啻閉其門而使之入、塞其道而使之行、此有連鎖關係、尤須先事解决者二也、故小組委員會、已將此項意見、提交執行委員會討論、</p>
<p>徵求意見　銀行公會秘書長林康侯氏、昨日下午、以電話分致錢業領袖秦潤卿·秦禊卿·等、告以銀行小組會已擬有意見、請錢業公會、最好亦提出意見數條、俾定期召集銀錢兩業聯席會議、互相探討、再作具體之决定、俾便呈復財政部核奪辦理云、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之十五）</p>
<p>三，柏蠟銷路及洋蠟</p>
<p>進口柏油銷路。分製燭製皂兩種。前已言之。江浙人口稠密。財力較裕。而上海又爲工業中心。皂廠林立。故兩省銷數。幾占全國生產量之牛。其次爲廣東福建。用途尚廣。其他各省，需要較稀。茲分述內外鉗路如下。</p>
<p>洋銷—拍油洋銷。在昔尚稱不弱。據民國元年出口數量。達二一四，三四九擔。計值關平銀二，三三三，七五九兩。嗣後逐年减少。上海出口洋行。雖不時向油行論價素樣。但成交無聞。下表爲近三年之輸出額。</p>
<p>淘銷—淘銷以禾本，小溪，坪油，津市，重荆，爲大宗。銷路視淘作之工作而定。查淘作期間。自三月至五月稱夏淘。八月至十月稱秋淘。十一月至十二月稱冬淘。夏洶冬淘用油最繁。故淘銷亦以斯時最旺。近年社會經濟衰落。及破除迷信運動之興起。在在足以影響淘銷。現今上海共有燭號一百十家。全年消費量。達五萬擔强。</p>
<p>皂銷—柏油皂廠銷路。瀕年受山東牛油。新加坡椰子油。日本硬化油之傾銷。影響至大。柏價低落以來。輸入减少。就椰子油進口論。民二十二年度爲五七，五七四公擔。二十三年度减爲五三，七七六公擔。二十四年度更减至二二，四一五公擔。椰子油减落之趨向。足以助長柏銷之發展。查柏油皂銷時期。以二月至五月爲最旺。秋冬入於落令。近年各大皂廠。常在冬令囤製存貨。故冬銷亦有轉機矣。</p>
<p>白蠟主要銷路。亦屬燭淘。用以遮蓋燭面。（俗稱蓋紅）。此外如製造蠟丸。蠟光紙等。我國輸菲茶葉。亦用白蠟攙製。在民元年間。輸出達三，七六四擔。迨至今日。每况下愈。近三年之出口數量。有如下表。</p>
<p>國內銷路。亦呈衰落，蓋自洋蠟輸入以來。燭面遮蓋。都用洋蠟替代。其他用量甚微。上海全年消費量。的達三千五百擔。以米心居多數。</p>
<p>茲爲明瞭柏蠟銷數起見。將各地消費數量。列表如下。</p>
<p>洋蠟之進口。始於光緒三十一年。當時吾國尚無洋蠟廠之設立。經美孚油公司輾轉求售。由南市高裕興燭店。首先試用。成效甚佳。民國八年。亞細亞德士古繼起經銷。其他進出口洋行。亦繼起經營。至民國二十三年四月。協助會運裝俄蠟到滬。進口數值益鉅。現在全滬經售洋蠟者。有美孚，亞細亞，德士古，天祥，孔士，公利，協助會等。銷售方法。由用戶直接向洋行訂購者居多。近三年來進口數量。二十二年度爲二六一，九二三公擔。二十三年度爲二六三，四九九公擔。二十四年度爲三○六，六三三公擔。每年值國幣八百萬元以上。（未完）</p>

<p>連勝兩盤連失兩盤棄　菲島中外觀衆對許俱表示不滿</p>
<p>王文正連獲勝利與論甚佳</p>
<p>（馬尼拉航空特訊）不遠千里而來之我國網球健將許承基、昨日在全菲國際網球錦標賽會初獻身手時、於先勝兩盤之後、竟中途棄權、使無名小卒菲選手羅耶里示奪得最後勝利、大負臨場中外觀衆之熱望、</p>
<p>許承基拱手讓人</p>
<p>昨日爲大會比賽之第三天、中外人士因慕許承基盛名及王文正對遠東大學能手普靈旦决戰之號召、到塲觀戰者極形擁擠、允以華僑爲多、許氏所遇對手爲全菲網球十傑表中無名之羅耶里示W.K.Royales、但交綏之下、許氏竟大失常、雖以七對五及七對五先勝兩盤、然每盤必經多决之等分（Deuce）、始克獲勝、第三盤開賽後、許氏以三對二之比佔先時、以畫界綫事向球證提出抗議、停賽凡十餘分鐘、後不知何故、許氏自願讓全盤勝利與對手、球證遂以六對三判羅耶里示勝第三盤、其後雙方由第一網球塲遷往中央場續賽、羅耶里示乃以六對一之比勝第叫盤、雙方既各勝兩盤、勝負關頭、在於第五盤、羅耶里示方以一對○佔先時、許氏忽患抽筋仆地、遂自願棄權、羅耶里示又徼倖獲勝、結果羅氏以五對七、五對七、六對三、六對一、及一對○（第五盤未終賽之結果）獲得最後勝利、</p>
<p>中外觀衆大失望</p>
<p>査許氏此决表演、大失觀衆之望、全場議論紛紛、有謂許第三盤以三對二佔先時、不繼續應戰、而反將勝利拱手讓人、既無會鬥精神、且失體育木旨、或謂縱使當時球證及檢綫員有偏袒之嫌、許氏亦應忍耐應戰、方不失體育家之本色、叉或謂照章球員中途棄權者則以失敗論、許氏第三盤中途棄權、即不能繼續比賽、雖於第五盤得勝、照例早應以失敗論之云云、</p>
<p>王文正大顯神威</p>
<p>昨日各場比賽中表演最精彩前風頭最健者、當推我國網球能手王文正、王氏昨日之對手爲遠東大學網球明星普靈旦、此子球藝、非同凡饗、在本屆全岷大學網球聯賽大會、曾一度擊敗斐網球大王大嘉維亞氏、王文正昨日對之、實無異進取複賽權之第一重關、普靈旦亦深悉王文正爲本屆大會危險人物之一、普靈旦先以三比六勝第一盤、王連勝二三兩盤、普靈旦再圖振作、以四對六勝回第四盤、兩雄各得兩盤後、乃作最後决戰、王文正以勝利關鍵在此一舉、且得僑衆喊吶助威、續戰之下、即大顯神通、利用其準確之左右抽射及奔網攔劈之技、以六對一大破敵方、總結果爲三對六、六對○、六對一、叫對六及六對一、王君在全塲歡呼聲中、遂奪得複賽權、定明日（十五）與澳洲哈實作複賽、觀兩人連日成績、王君大有壓倒澳選手之望、</p>
<p>王文正大得好評</p>
<p>王文正在菲、頗得好評華僑商報評王云、我國網球健將王文正來菲比賽、擊敗菲島單打冠軍嘉維亞、得岷里拉市區網球錦標、經菲島體育協進會挽留、現在又參加菲列賓國際網球比賽會、菲人認識我國網球球藝之進步、可說是王君之功、球場上的勝敗、是運動家的常事、我們批評運動家、當然不應專重勝收、運動家的態度與人格、實在比勝敗更要緊、因爲修養功夫、一定要身心兼顧、如其　重　力巧技、不問其他、寶在失掉了運動的眞義、王君球技的好、姑不必說、他的態度人格、很有値得我們注意的地方、第一、他是一個不慌不忙的人、熊度異常鎭靜、第二、他絕對沒有一般運動家輕佻驕縱的惡習、一舉一動、處處表現他忠實的本性、第三、他善於保養自己、沒有殘害身心的嗜好、第四、不管對手如何、也不管勝敗如何、他盡心盡力打他的球、一刻不肯放鬆、一步不肯苟且、他不僅在比賽的時候是這樣、在平常練習的時候也這樣、這種精神、最爲難得、這是他成功的秘訣、也就是其他一切成功者的秘訣、（馬尼拉十四日發）</p>

<p>國難不恐怖，救國有大路，舉國無老幼，人人著國布。</p>
<p>此黨國元老吳老先生句也。吳老先生認爲服用國產棉布是救國的一條大路，這是一針見血之談，值得大家記着的。不多時候，報上載着英國新皇到那市塲裹去參觀，他買了一些國貨的服裝，親手指給國人道，我量歡喜用我們本國工廠的出品，希望大家今後一致用英國的國貨，這是最有光榮的。你看見歐美人日本人那一個不是穿着他們本國出產的衣料？有時他們還驕傲的向着我們說：貴國人爲什麼歡喜穿外國衣料，明明有很好的綢布不用，究竟什麼心理？我聽了又氣惱，又慚愧，認爲服用外貨，確是國人莫大的恥辱。當初還可以說國產衣料，尚沒有優美的出品。現在經許多國貨工廠的努力，所有出品，可說和外國貨比較，有過之無不及，事實勝於雄辯，你到國貨公司國貨布廠去觀察，便知幾年來國產棉布之進步，着實驚人。本刊特出專號，來喚起國人的注意。</p>
<h3 id="c183">値得提倡的國產棉布 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>衣服爲人身之章，所以一個人穿的衣服的適合與吾，是很足以代表他自己品格的優長的，古人大布之衣，大帛之冠，像韓文公的布衣終身，敬姜的子貴猶續，允其可以昭示我們，我國過去歷史上的賢人良母，是如何採用樸實的服裝，度着淸貧的生活，而爲着國家，民族的前途努力的。</p>
<p>可是，歷史的演進，我國自海通以後，歐美風氣的傳染，一般所謂摩登男女奢侈的習尚，他們允其對於服裝方面，不但在形式上大起變易，西裝革履，旗袍大衣，並且在質料方面，更大都採用洋貨，牢建起酷愛舶來的心理，我們只要看這幾年來入超的驚人，舶來呢羢，絲織品的大量輸華，和另一方面，我們原有的棉布業，絲織業的呌苦連天，就可知道這禍害的劇烈，而威脅着我整個民族經濟的命脈，促成我國窮民貧的主因，亡國破家的危機，將就展開在我們面前。</p>
<p>所以，中國大衆在現階段，我敢截金擊鐵的說一句，我們採用服裝的先决條件，一定非國產不可，並且，在這樣經濟恐慌，市面不景氣的日益尖銳化下，我們允其應該注意服裝的樸實和節儉，而值得大家共同來提倡國貨的棉布，用來製成服裝，據我知道，像三友實業社，和鴻新染織廠·三新染織廠布疋等，質料優美，用以裁製無論爲長衫，旗袍，西裝，學生裝，都十分大方美觀，且經穿耐用，不易摺皺，和高價的洋貨相比，也很足並駕齊驅，但是價格方面，可以便宜許多，值此我國經濟前途，繫於千鈞一髮的時候，我們如何可以再去充任洋貨推銷員，而不爲國貨前途，盡國民一份子的天職呢！</p>
<p>我們來大聲疾呼吧！願大家共同努力提倡國產棉布運動。</p>

<p>— 喬耘飱</p>
<p>南通這縣分，是與模範省山西齊名的，它是個馳盛譽的實業區，所以如此，當然人傑而後地靈了；這模範雅號，由張嗇庵先生一手造成敎育，實業，市政，交通，水利，都駕乎他縣之上，有是因而後結是果，模範二字，在南通鼎盛時期，誠足當之無愧呢；其實它的「南通大布，」發源很早，並不在張氏退歸林下努力新南通以後，它本是個各省著名的產棉區，「國產棉布」，銷行最廣，舫織最久，「南通大布，」似乎無出其右；它是普遍化的農村副業，茅屋數椽，木機兩架，沒有上工下工的晷刻，沒有工友僱員的消費，在該縣每一個村婦，每一名鄉姑，都有這種紡紗織布的技能；推行到什麼程度呢？你會吃飯麼？你會拉屎麼？旣會吃飯拉屎沒有不會紡紗織布的，這種風尚，由南通蔓延到海門，波及到如臯；所以通海大布，如臯靑布，是抓住一塊兒呌喚的；從前門面窄，現在已經加闊，最合成製被褥裏層，短衫短褲，也很相宜，堅實耐洗，無有其匹；一被一衣，歷十年八載，不破不洞；蘇省江北各縣，娶媳嫁女，迄今猶沿此風，總要買若干「通州大布，」「如臯靑布；」近年爲迎合潮流起見，也兼織花紋布匹，自東北失陷，减少大批出關貨色，但是福建廣東，依舊有常駐水客，設莊收買，據說目前經紗已易紗廠出品，緯紗照常自紡，一布之成，貴在挺立不倒；微聞嗇翁生前終年土布衫褲，瀕危面囑孝若公子，內襯衾衣，一律土布裁製，僅外衣是農商總長禮服而已；他省實業應，農鑛廳，每年常委專員，到通採辦棉種；筆者間歲留通小住，淸晨目擊一般農村婦女，肩挑担荷，把布匹送到莊上出賣，莊店沒有開市，就倚門鵠候；至於滬揚江輪，行抵通州，一往一來，都有賣通州大布的販子；如果這種技術，深入各個鄉鎭，農村經濟，何至破產？經售組織完善，南通大布，可登國產棉布第一把交椅；紡織，推銷，亦遍於各省，那麼我們的「棉布市塲，」還容第二人來挿足麼。</p>
<h3 id="c185">我服用國產棉布的小經騐 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 曼彬</p>
<p>十年以前，在史量才先生府上，開了一個服用國產棉布展覽會，是三友實業社主持的。那天到會的學校有十餘處，女太太和小姐們，也有五六十位，都是穿着國產布的服裝到會，大家研究下來，認爲衣服的裁製，要備具五個條件：第一是國產，第二是樸素，第三是堅固，第四是經濟，第五是美觀。當時各校校長都認定這五個條伴來替學生選定衣服，有一位校長不贊成美觀，可是因爲不限於校服關係，到底加上這一條。從此以後，我自己做衣服，和替兒女們做衣服，總是抱定這個主張。有時學校當局，買了不是國貨，或改頭換面的國貨，我總是親自到校和他們爭辨的。我常說學校做校服，如果不肯認眞用國貨，還講什麼愛國，什麼救國呢？最近我因爲小孩都長大了，沒有事做，常常到各學校去看看，順便勸他們選用校服，要注意眞正的國產棉布。有時我老實不客氣的給他們許多樣品，勸他們不要被人朦混過去，使許多愛用國貨的家庭，對你們學校失望。同時分訪許多家庭，勸他們都來服用國貨衣料。我去年嫁女時侯。關於嫁妝內衣服，可說都是採用國貨的衣料。三友社及鴻新廠，是我的老主顧，胥仰南先生，還做了我的顧問。中國國貨公司經售的鴻新達豐三新等廠的布疋，我是每星期總要走一趟去看看的，最近三友社的三樓商塲，我也是常常走走，認爲我們婦女界應有的責任。最好笑的，吾的八歲女孩子，他每决穿新衣，總是問是吾是胥伯伯或萬先生廠裏出的，因爲她每聽見姊姊告訴她我家衣料的購置，是鴻新或三友的出品。允共好笑的，吾的十一歲女兒，校中替她做校服，她總是不要，回來一定要我親自替她選購，小孩子最是天眞爛漫，她們小腦子裏存了非國貨不買，總是很堅强的，永遠不肯苟且的。昨天我的外甥女因爲新生小孩，請人吃滿月酒，我到她家裹，看見陳列的許多小孩衣服，十分之七八，是國貨工廠的出品，大家很是稱贊她的愛國心，認爲養成小孩從小服用國貨的習慣，這種地方，是很要注意的。吾還記得，這决產銷合作會發起服用國貨會，到會的婦女，共有一百零八人，穿國產棉布衣料的，有六十餘人，可說已過半數，而穿國產綢緞的，也有四十人，那天穿外國衣料的。可說絕跡。萬一有人穿了，也要自慚形穢，侷促不安了。從這一點看來，中國國貨的前途，是很有希望的。</p>
<h3 id="c186">我們婦女所服用之國產棉布 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 菊菊女士</p>
<p>我服用棉布的起因，大概還在我未嫁以前，那時國內的棉布，已極盛行，卽我婦女們，有的雖然亦用舶來品的洋布，但大部份的婦女同胞，已能服用國產棉布了。譬如同樣一件旗袍，洋布做的只有那般摩登們的太太奶奶小姐穿的了，我們中下階級裏的婦女，大都是用國產棉布製的，記得我那時年齡還小，我母親在世時，我們兄弟姊妹等，都穿國產棉布製的衣服，個個喜歡，母親還說，「棉布製的衣服，可以多穿幾年，因爲牠布身的經久，質地的耐用，同時又價鈿便宜，所以我們很愛用，如其你們不嫌什麼的，不妨沿習着仍可替你們子女做棉布的衣服，……」這幾句話現在回想起來，宛然在耳。</p>
<p>後來棉布因了洋布的侵入，漸漸把棉布淘汰，所有幾家自紡自織的人家，却因了洋布便宜，便棄掉了不幹，以至婦女們都穿上了洋布的衣服，但我仍遵着慈訓，自己穿的，小孩們穿的以及全家用的，都是採用三友實業社出品和鴻新三新等廠的棉布，所以我的同學們說「你眞眞是個提倡國貨的實行家，吾國能有幾個像你這樣的人肯穿着棉布，用着棉布，」而在我心目中瞧來，棉布確實比洋布多少耍經用些，耐用些啊！</p>

<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>說起土布，我不禁想到：穿了士布衣服，飄飄如傳的老農來了！</p>
<p>老農長髯及胸，依然日出而作，日入而息！精神矍鑠！他老人家，自頂至踵，沒有一處不是穿的土布，黑色布帽，靑色布袍，白色布襪，而脚踏實地的苦幹！實幹！種出粒粒如珍珠的米，給不知稼穡艱難的人的享用，嘗告誡子孫道：「一粥一飯，當思來處不易！半絲半縷恒念物力維艱！」</p>
<p>從前鄉村裏是充滿機杼聲的，所謂「男耕女織」汨乎舶來棉布一傾銷！那鄕村裏織土布的工藝，便被淘汰！而弄得杼柚俱空了！「喞喞復喞唧，木蘭當户織，不聞機杼聲？但聞女嘆息！」好似爲千古後世的今日寫照！</p>
<p>土布鄉農，自織的土布，幅頭極狹！每逢農隙，農婦，農夫，往往堆置肩頭上，出門沿户呌賣的，我母却很喜歡買來裁製襯衫和替我做布襪的：目下上海國貨布廠的棉布形色更好，當然允受大衆的歡迎。</p>
<p>記者回溯土布鄉農的淳樸！勤儉！如果人人效土布鄉農的（如上述的老農那樣）終身服用土布，國不待救而自救了！</p>

<p>莫打鼓來莫打鑼。聽我唱個國貨歌。中國開化本最早。創造從來也衆多。近想軒轅是黃帝。遠溯三皇與伏羲。已往事跡猶能詳。始畫八卦造書契。結了網罟敎佃漁。又養犧牲充庖廚。種種制作由此起。人人樂業皆安居。上古衣服有絲麻。四時穿着非奢華。育蠶治絲號縲祖。雖做元妃也浣沙。棉花相傳來印度。中士於今有粗布。宜春宜夏更宜冬。農田耕作唯此務。自是利賴千百年。花色好比綺羅鮮。所以彈捍和軋織。女工搓絮復扯綿。不料五口通商後。外人勢迫還利誘。舶來物品滿市塲。攫我金錢不放手。試翻洋關總册稽。漏巵歲歲無窮期。一衣一履雖微細。都是民膏與民脂。故吾竭誠來奉告。國貨原爲國之寶。當此民窮財盡時。醒悟大家總耍早。繁興市面靠農工。第一儉樸最雍客。耍拒外貨非難事。只須力戮與心同。從此百業能再起。國富兵强可立至。諸君牢牢記在心。卽是愛國男兒志。</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>中華國貨產銷合作協會，在二月二十二日，舉行一决「新春交誼」於南京路大陸商塲七樓正誼社，我在午後二時，也得便參加，是日雖然天氣陰沉得很，可是到會的各界來賓，多至五六百人，會塲之內，陳列了許多著名國貨工廠的優良出品，如中國化學工業社，五和織造廠，中華琺瑯廠，美亞織綢廠，中華第一針織廠，鴻新染織廠，亞光製造公司，華福製造廠，華生電器廠，一心牙刷廠，大華鐵工廠，康元襲罐廠，中國內衣公司，三友實業社，……等數百家，出品有美麗新穎的時代綢緞和永不退色布疋，有各種工業上的各項重要用品，有種種裝潢悅目，品質高超的化裝香品，有發條一開，自己會動的敎育玩具，有新家庭適宜的各式鋼鐵傢具，會塲的一切，都是新的美的，使人羨慕的，使人歡迎的，這都是當天到會實業界的產兒，是富國裕民的驕子，</p>
<p>開幕了，由主席報告開會宗旨後，接連的幾個節目過後，就是餘與，有小朋友張銀蟾的演說，博得許多來賓的掌聲，據說那位小朋友，還祇有八歲呢，伊是女性，穿了一件大紅綢的童裝，天眞得很，伊演說的姿勢，也很老練，確是難得，華龍小學的歌劇，也很使人歡迎，那十幾位小朋友，男女都有，演來滑稽突梯，臺前的來賓，遂個個都閉不攏口，還有一位女性小朋友唱靑衣，咬字準確，音調圓潤，爲此會生色不少，</p>
<p>尤其使人值得紀念的是黃冰佩浦曼彬林克聰女士等，發起的「婦女服用國貨會」了，當天簽名入會的女士們，也多得不可勝數，黃女士還說：「現在有了國貨公司，好比給了我們一個可靠的保證人，以前要買國貨，常常很不放心，以爲是改頭換面吧，現在有國貨公司證明了他們的貨品都是眞正國貨，所以我們各界要買國貨，都得到國貨公司去，包可得到非常的安慰，……」伊的一番話，說得一些也不錯。</p>
<p>那天潘仰堯先生，也發表了許多關於勸人服用國貨的話，發言滑稽，非常動聽，他說：「服用國貨，最好是婦唱夫隨，請女太太們來做先導，那麼事無不成，今天婦女服用國貨會，各位女士簽名踴躍這一點看來，知道婦女界不比以前了，同時我們做先生們的，那可不追隨在伊們後面去努力呢！……」</p>
<p>後來還有不少好的節目，可惜篇幅有限；就此收束吧！</p>

<h3 id="c209">一點答覆與質問 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 曾建屏</p>
<p>—讀了「生活書店答覆「評生活全國總書目」啟事之後—</p>
<p>前一週，因為我做了一篇批評「生活全國總書目」的文章，因此引起了生活書店登「啟事」為該書編者答辯。其答辯內容分為五則，現特再為答覆及附帶質問如次：</p>
<p>一，過去我的文章，曾說過：「自以為勝過某某目錄」語，係因看見該書的序文而言。該書序者于震寰先生曾說：「此編所收凡二萬種。類例淸明，與××…總目錄，××…目錄等較，自覺豐美出衆，而可為讀書之指南。」序文旣經如招牌一樣地登在編者的書中，而編者却可以為「似亦不能代為負責，」這種態度，實大失「國士之風」，曾建屏並不欲再辯。</p>
<p>二，關於辛墾版「資本論大綱」及卿雲版「資本論」列為兩版，平心君旣孜孜歸罪於手民，自然我們也不便替排字工友叫屈。</p>
<p>三，關於書目中內聞有少數書籍加以評語，平心君以為「目的亦在便利讀者選購讀物，並無任何偏見可言。」這幾句話不僅是曲解，而且是說謊。因為編者在該書的「編例」中，明明說過：「凡屬世界名著，書名前加有圓點　，內容有問題者，書名前加有▲符。惟上述劃分法難免參入編者主見，錯誤也難可必無……。」旣曰有「主見，」又曰「錯誤也難保必無，」則其為「偏見，「似也不必再花本錢登「啟事」來强辯。</p>
<p>四，平心君以為：「凡屬參考資料（如農村經濟資料等），調查報吿（如地質礦物調查報吿等），工具書籍在書目中均不加符號。」現在我們且放下這個「例外」不談，而從例內」來問：為什麼關於佛敎部份各業，中國經濟槪况部份A項等行各書，編者也大多數甚至一律不加符號呢？如果是這些書也不能十分確定其深淺的內容，則可以說是編者之「無識，」如果是這些書也該「例外。」則是編者的曲解及詭辯。「無識」乎？曲解乎？編者又有何說？</p>
<p>五，最後編者曾以為我說：「該書目編輯目的是在「推銷自己的書籍」……，」認為無爭辯之必要，其實，我所說上述的話，實在是有着大大的理由。因為該書目在一百四十二—三頁中，關於法西斯蒂的書籍，計被收入者共有三十七本之多。這三十七本，只有生活書店出版董之學著的「法西主義」標上了一個什麼人可讀的「中級」符號。起使關於法西書籍是不標的，是「例外」的，為什麼「生活」自己所出版的，却偏偏要標上去呢？標注的目的，據說是在於「便利讀者選購物，」那麼，我說編者是在「推銷自己的書籍，」似乎不會過份。奈何編者之不大方，而斷斷雄辯呢？</p>
<p>至於評書之首。是在於以客觀的態　，求眞理之昌明。即使評閱較苛，也所以推眞求實，原無先入之見，平心君在其所編書目中，旣不以公允的態度以完其「纂輯之學，」更復據其　主觀的意見，」將「國際通史」「嗎克民十二講」及「最近各國補習敎育」等三書，列為「有問題」之書籍。不知上舉三書，究竟有什麼問題？卽使上舉三書眞有「問題」那「總書目」中又豈止這區區的三本書？有人以為：「　輯之學，本來用不着注解，用不着表示編者的意見；」然而編者一定要表示出來，這種態度究竟是可以「欽仰」，抑或算是「糟塌」，我們實在不願再花費「出版界」的篇幅，以做這種不關切要的辯論。至於平心君將我所批評者歸還　曾君「曾君」，那我也只好接受起來，橫堅是非自有旁觀人的言論，我們的氣度，又何必不表示大方呢？</p>

<p>圖書的統計是最緊要不過的，但是，要作整個國家的圖書的統計，却不是件易事。柳詒謀先生說的好，『貧儒著述，富室業刋，官廳文件，社團譔集，每有印刷之品，第為投贈之資，初不售於書坊，亦不登於報紙。知其事者，展轉訪求：不知者卽無從購覽。』在這麼繁重綦難的工作當中，平心先生大發宏願，「以一人之力赴纂輯之繁勞，」編出這本厚的「全國總書目」來問世，不能不說是大可人意的一椿事。于震寰先生　　時，再的替許平心先生道：『吾深識其難面欽重其毅力。自朝及莫非，目有觸盡書名·人名·坊名·肆名·機關名·價錢多寡也，手有錄亦盡書名·人名·坊名·肆名·機關名·價錢多寡也。其乏趣為何如乎？徵集資料，亦至艱苦。……經手之書甚多，編者皆得過眼，則比之見目不見書者，又勝百倍矣。』這樣看起來，這書該是至詳且盡而無絲毫缺陷的了。然而我們翻檢起來，却不免有所失望，不獨我們所未知未曉的難以從書找地出來；我們知之稔熟的也遍尋不獲，這就可怪了。為使編者得於再版時力事補充以臻完備起見，聊就謠俗學的一部，伸說如次。其他各部，限於篇幅與時間，且暫不說。</p>
<p>說到中國謠俗學（Follklore）的發端，不能不推尊北京大學的「歌謠研究會，」主其事的是沈兼士·顧頡剛·劉半農·常惠·周作人·魏建功·白滌洲·錢玄同等。他們都是有名的學者，曾經努力工作，出過「歌謠週刋，」（後更集為彙刋）「國學門周刋，」印過專書，（董作賓·顧頡剛二先生都有歌謠專集間世，）成績不差，誰也不會把他們忘記的。本書編者平心先生已知有謠俗學，却不知有歌謠研究會，不獨「歌謠周刋」的彙刋不曾列入，連「吳歌」，「看見她」等專書也找不出來，這豈不是怪事？「生活」沒有這些書，也該去翻翻圖書館的書目才是。。不，這麼不尋常的「掛一漏萬，」是大大的足為本書之玷呵。</p>
<p>其次，說到廣州中大民俗學會的業書，拙編「海龍王的女兒」，（三角。），有趙景深，容肇祖二先生的序，正是一個地方——廣東，翁源。——的民間故事的結集，編者不把它編入，不知是什麼理由？我意，編者是止看書目，沒有去翻看內容的；以為就名字看起來，太美麗了，决不像故事的書名，這樣便一筆圈消了。從此看來，編者自己所說的話，『僅僅依照一個書名分，那是不知道要鬧多少笑話的，』正好移來奉贈給他。反之，所說『不得將未曾讀過的書借來或買來翻一翻』的話，我們就有點兒不敢輕易置信了。</p>
<p>再其次，說到杭州中國民俗學會的努力與功績也是不弱的。德日兩國的同性質的學術機關的主持人且都曾予以相當的褒揚。編者已知其有「民俗學彙刋」的出版，何以不知他們一夥子在紹興湯浦民間出版部印行的」些書籍？（其也散印的不計）</p>
<p>（傳說結集）</p>
<p>太陽和月亮　淸水編　二角五分</p>
<p>李調元故事　葉德均編一角五分</p>
<p>月光歌謠專集　婁予匡編一角五分</p>
<p>老虎外婆故事專集　鍾敬文編一角五分</p>
<p>民俗彙刋　林培廬　三角</p>
<p>新年風俗志　婁子匡　六角</p>
<p>（注）此書編者說出版家是「大公報」，誤。二十四年一月已改在商務出版，定價三角五分，編者亦未之知。</p>
<p>這幷不是私人的書籍，有得買，有得借，有得看的，編者竟然不知，其未廣事搜尋，大有遺漏，不也彰彰明甚麼？他如幾個為人所稔知的民欲學的夥友們在各地出版的書籍，如林培　的「潮州民間故事集」（汕頭開明書店）「李子長好畫」，謝雲聲的「福建故事集」（全四冊，厦門中華書局），翁國樑，國聲兄弟出版的「漳州民間故事集」，王智章的「漳州歌謠」，曹松葉的「金華謎語」，……等數十冊都沒有搜尋編入，各地民敎館的出版物，尙未列入。殊為可惜。（敝人尙有一故事集「魔術師」，廣東翁聯興書局出版，每冊一角二分。）</p>
<p>書名或著者姓名微有錯誤的，也有多少；說話已多，恕不多　了。</p>
<p>總面言之，這本書目的出版，在現今的咱們中國，誠然是獨一無二的再詳盡也沒有的了。　一人之力而能有此，也可說是難能了。不過以云全國書目止得此數，則又不然。我希望平心先生不以此為滿足，精益求精的一再補充，以求完備。最好按門分部的向各關係的機關或學人函詢通問，多費些郵票與時日，則所得的結果，當較為滿意可靠。這麼不壓求煩的去廣事搜求，極力補充，期年之後，當必比前詳盡，大有可觀。一本巨著的集纂的起始，是難免無所錯誤或失之粗淺的，鄭振鐸的「文學大綱」如此，馮女蘭的「人生哲學」如此。商務的「辭源」，出版了這麼久尙不能够盡滿人意，何况這本初印的「全國書目」？然而，從有錯到無錯，從粗陋簡略以至詳盡專精，編者究應時時存着這種心理，努力以赴之，這才可以望得着良好的結果。倘其不然，心懷偏見，認他人的公評為攻擊，則以粗陋始以粗陋終，那就非我之所欲有言了。</p>

<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>但是新文學還沒有建立若何基礎，一般組製濫造的文學作品已充斥了市塲，有許多不過是中學生校作文簿上的文章，印行起來，也可成為很好的文學專集。如當時所有的刋物，像泰東，祗見一些狂喊，如眞美善，除了曾氏父子的譯作外，也不見有什麼眞美善的地方。此外，等而下之，更不用說。這樣，所謂新文學，自必慢慢兒為人厭棄起來。</p>
<p>同時，經過了國民革命的怒潮，大家對於現社會的認識，需要理論的解釋，已非單純的文學的申訴，所能滿足，於是繼之而起的第二個潮流，即入於社會科學的時期。新興社會科學的紹介，自有其客觀的需要，但在這個潮流開始，即為新書業中的市儈所破壞。他們無選擇的出版社會科學的書，把許多名著譯成天書，致使許多靑年對於新興社會科學見而生畏。如現已歸併於現代成立不久後，即繼出文學書及兒童書的聯合書店。且以「專門社會科學書店」相標榜。則當時社會科學書籍之為書業市儈的利藪，可以想見。俱是好景不常，這潮流因政黨煽動作用，及市儈投機，終於不久即吿消滅。有許多社會科學書籍無從出版了，有的又不受讀者歡迎，這個時期，即吿終結。</p>
<p>繼之而起的，又是文學書的潮流，但與初期不同。這時因經過了理論的涵養，又因讀者對於文學書內容的進一步的要求，遂發生了所謂革命文學的運動。一般新書店，以為終究還是文學書的銷路好，又開始了文學書的競爭。結果，這運動又因種種關係消沉下來。</p>
<p>這個時期很使新書店的編輯先生們徬徨，文學書是社會科學書都沒有辦法，還有什麼書好出呢？徬徨中聽說兒童書局賺了錢，商務中華地兒童書也很好銷，於是大家又轉而向兒童及小學生乃方面進攻。但不久，商務中華兩家大書局，來了個兒童文庫，小學生文庫等大規模的傾銷，各規模小的書店，祇有屈服於大資本排擠小資本的鐵則之下。</p>
<p>兒童書失敗，大家想，敎課書是學生不得不買的，或者有辦法吧。來，出版敎課書吧。要知道，敎課書根本是大量生產，或大資本獨佔的賣買，豈容小書店染指其間。中學課本一律八折，小學課本一律六折，沒務中華世界，大東等主力戰閒始，實力差者祇有敗北，其他小書店鑒不遠，自然祗有避走他路。</p>
<p>出演至此因國內一般購賣力衰落，新書業已走上了崩潰的階段，其廻光反照的表現，便是古書及雜誌年的同時出現。出版古書，便是說祗有圖書館，收藏家還有一些購買能力。出版雜誌，便是說大衆對於智識的要求，已不是專書，而是短篇雜誌，而雜誌中，尤其是幽默刋物及圖畫雜誌。——最近，更由雜誌而走到小型報紙，是新書店將慢慢地被排斥於文化圈外。（對於小型報紙，據本人的觀察，以為在敎育未能普及於大衆的今日中國，其發展不過是文化更趨表落的表示，因小型報紙並不能創造新的讀者，其讀者仍不過是那些讀大報及雜誌的人。）</p>
<p>試看，近一二年來，各書店有什麼書出版，不論是質的方面或量的方面？今日出版新書最努力的要推商務了，每日都在二本及二本以上。但是一部份因中國客觀的條件决定，不易產生研究高深的學者，遂也很少有價値較多的書寫作。觀乎商務每日新書，少見有價値有意義的新義，便可推見一般。其他各書局，大都出書的數量已很少，更無論書的質量。有些書店仍在出書，但時代彷彿逆轉。出書的水凖祗有倒退。有的，雖還不至於與「一折八扣一的市儈爭利，但無聊的投機書之出版，已佔了主要地位。如「××百日通」，「實用××法」等頗風流行。有時，因與他們書店的名譽有關，不敢公然出版，便假造一個書店的名稱，表面上祗見寄售關係，實則全是他們自己的東西。在出書上，新書店蓬勃的朝氣，早已沒有了。（未完）</p>

<p>柏林達司托雜誌云，自從德國　氏在一千八百四十九年發明內分泌學說以來研究者風起雲湧，日有新的進步，然終以提取此項荷爾蒙手續之類難，功效終不能如預期之確，故近來荷爾蒙之製劑雖充斥市塲，語其成效，華多不凖，於是遂有人疑內分沁療法已破產矣。其實此語操之過切也，據最近亞克博士報告，謂女子久婚不孕，多由卵巢機能失常，欲糾正此種失常，勢非用內分泌療法不可。嗣經博士多年來之苦心研究，發見用青春旺盛期之雌性動物卵巢荷爾蒙，以科學之新方法製成之，注射於將近衰老期而不孕之天竺鼠，距三星期後，此被試驗之天竺鼠行動活潑，各內分泌均起新變化，竟與青春期無二。乃以雄性之天竺鼠伴宿，未幾此被試驗之天竺鼠居然受姙矣。如此反覆試驗多次，始將此種內分泌製成「補女容」，用之於神經衰弱，貧血失眠，發育不全，月經不調，久婚不孕，或將近更年期之婦女，無不迅速受孕，百發百中，故歐美女子因失孕而被損於丈夫者，莫不爭購此藥，皆居然獲孕，重偕舊好，而「補女容」一藥遂馳名世界矣。幫「補女容」一藥，實已達到最理想而聞滿之內分泌療法云。</p>

<h3 id="c222">再談「節制生育」 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>提倡「節制生育」的美國山額夫人，近日又到了上海，這是第二决到中國來宣傳她的「節育」主義。</p>
<p>本埠報界，對於山額夫人的主張，原有贊成和反對兩派，我本來對於這個問題，不大願意去談，贊成可，反對亦可，因爲贊成亦只有理論上的贊成，於事實上恐不能發生任何效力，故實際上原可不必反對。</p>
<p>現在我姑從理論上來加以討論，據反對「節育」最有力量的說法，便是說：「中國能接受山額夫人主張的，只有知識階級，知識階級是優秀份子，倘智慧的兒童父母「節育，」只有貧窮愚蒙的農民勞工生育兒女，旣無敎育能力，終成流浪兒童。」</p>
<p>我對於這個主張，頗有一些異議，第一，我要問優秀份子生下來的兒女，是否定是優秀份子，優秀與不優秀，恐不在於人種，而在於敎育，第二，我要問優秀份子是吾多有生活能力，是吾多有金錢來培植他們的兒女，這兩個問題，先應當明瞭一下。</p>
<p>說到現在的知識份子，也煞是可憐，餓死也有，自殺也有，在家抱小兒也有，做賊做强盜也有，做漢奸做奸商也有，前年有一位出洋過的大學生，不是幹過騎刦海輪的大盜麼？不久浙江槍决三位大學生，不過因爲做了綁匪麼？他們是不是知識份子？現在華北的殷汝耕，及關外傀儡劇中多少主角，恐怕也不能不算他們是優秀份子，和知識階級吧？</p>
<p>我再翻轉來問一聲，優秀份子必定生優秀份子，則大亭生下來的必定小亨，大要人生下來的必定是小要人，大腹賈生下來的必定是小腹賈，然試問所謂大亨，所謂要人，所謂名流以及在社會上有生產能力的人，及一切在社會上能做利益羣生事業的人，他們的父母，是吾多是優秀份子，我雖不能一一加以調查，但他們的父母，並不是優秀份子，而能從困苦艱難中奮鬥出來的，恐也不少吧？</p>

<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>由澡堂裏出來，我低着頭在馬路上走着。突然的，我的肩上被一隻手掌拍了一下，還沒有等我來得及看淸他的面彩，一本白色的水書馬上擲到我的胸前；小書的封面也不待我端詳一下，他就說話了：</p>
<p>「你入過敎沒有」？</p>
<p>低頭看看手裏的小本子，那上面端端正正的印着「福音」兩個字，於是我說：</p>
<p>「我沒有人過教」。</p>
<p>「那你應該馬上就入敎」。他的眼光是肯定的，口吻却有些近乎命令。「你住在那兒，你們那兒有敎堂沒有？」</p>
<p>「住在靜安寺。」</p>
<p>「那很好，靜安寺有敎堂，你應該每天去。」他的話匣子拉開了；一串不知背了几百次的話，由他最終滾滾而出。「你知道麼？耶穌是上帝的兒子，凡是信仰耶穌的人，上帝都使他永生，都使他升入天堂。」即刻，他的眼中露出了恐嚇而誘惑的光芒：「你是有罪的。不獨是你，世界上的每一個人都是有罪的。你要曉得：不信耶穌的人都要入地獄。——地獄兩個字說得特別響———你懂得什麽叫做地獄麼？嚇！地獄就是上海人所說的「赤佬」住得地方」！</p>
<p>「信耶穌能得到飯吃嗎？」他那教訓似的口吻，使我不耐煩起來。</p>
<p>「那很好，我跟你去入敎好了，不過要你先請我吃一頓飯。」我作着預備跟他走的姿勢。</p>
<p>「喂！你不要一開頭就想到吃飯；先信上帝好了，飯當然是有吃的。———你看我，」他將手往胸脯上一抹，好像要把自己的衣服更摸得挺直一點似的。「從家鄕到上海又沒一個親戚，又沒一個銅子，也活了這麼六七年。——嚇！只要信上帝，還怕沒有穿吃麼？」</p>
<p>「一個人在肚皮餓得很的時候，還有什麼比吃飯更重要的麼？」憤憤地說</p>
<p>「敎你不要老是想到吃飯……」</p>
<p>「假如我餓死了呢？」我搶着說了。</p>
<p>「死掉了還去信上帝麼？」</p>
<p>「給你說，信上帝的人是不會餓死的。——就作算會死，死了也可以升天堂呀！」可是卽刻他又糾正了上而的說話：「不，信上帝的人是不會死的，是會永生的；不要說我們人類，就是飛鳥和蟲蟻上帝也要好好的保護他們；上帝是仁慈的呀！」</p>
<p>「那末敦賀的飛鳥爲什麽會找不到食物，互相殘殺的死掉了幾千呢？難道他們也不信上帝麼？」</p>
<p>「那，那……「那是不會有的事。」他的臉色一陣陣的紅上來了。「那，那上帝可管不了這麼些……」他果竟被我這審判官逼出了口供。</p>
<p>他窘得局促不安，在旁觀者的一陣笑聲裏，神聖的假面具被我抓得粉碎了。</p>

<p>— 黃旭</p>
<p>她在太太的房門口往返地隨著。焦急地搓着二手，一回想舉起手來把房門推開，一回又胆怯地垂了下來，這種遲疑不决的樣子，她已做過十多决了。</p>
<p>最後，她終於鼓着勇氣把門推開，躡手躡脚走了進去。聽得門響，正在打麻將的太太便橫過眼來看了她一下。給這比箭還利的眼光一射，她那隻有着二片笨厚的嘴唇的闊嘴巴立刻說不出話來了。</p>
<p>「太太，太太，……」吶吶地重復着斗了二聲，臉也脹紅了，厚嘴唇微微在顫動。</p>
<p>「什麼事？」太太隨口問了一句，稍帶點粗厲，因爲剛有一副淸三台被上家搶先和了去，正在生氣。</p>
<p>「太太，吾想，吾想……」照例她又重復地說若，正想把預備好了的一肚子說話慢慢地伸訴出來，猛不防太太側過半個臉，劈面擲來一句道：</p>
<p>「你想什麼」？</p>
<p>她嚇了一跳，一肚子說話都不知逃到那裏去了，就只好單刀直入地說道：</p>
<p>「吾想……吾想跟太太借幾塊錢！……」</p>
<p>「借錢？」這一回太太似乎吃了一驚，其餘三位扛牌女客也都抬起臉來了。太太旋轉頭來，討厭地看着這個女人說：「借錢做什麼用？」</p>
<p>「吾的男人……病了……病得……很……厲害……沒有錢請……醫生……吃藥……恐怕……恐怕……性命……」她顫抖着聲音說，每一句好像都在打滾，所以不大淸楚。說到最後一句時，她已不敢抬起頭來，眼淚撲簌簌地掛了下來，於是她把衣角拿上去揩着。</p>
<p>在賭錢時有人來借錢，太太是最憎恨，最犯忌的！何況正在太太打牌不順手的當兒，何況更在年腳邊竟對著自己流起眼淚來呢？不吉利！太太起先還覺得他有點可憐，後來卻變為憎恨，甚至仇視了。</p>
<p>「哼，借錢！規矩一點也不懂，竟當吾面哭，你是在觸吾霉頭呵！……」太太越想越生氣，牌暫時停了，立起身來，跑到她的面前大聲說道；</p>
<p>「你給吾滾，這兒用不着你！」</p>
<p>這好像晴天一聲霹靂，她嚇呆了。樸的一聲，她本能地跪了下去。</p>
<p>「太太，太太，救救吾，救救吾！……吾的男人……吾的婆婆……吾的孩子都要靠吾養活的！……太太，太太，吾……吾不能離開這裏！……」</p>
<p>她跪在地板上痛哭着，哀求着，像一雙手上的羊。</p>
<p>但是没有用！太太仍舊虎起了面孔，絲毫沒有憐憫，驕傲的自尊心在威脅她！她覺得這個女人愈是這樣做，愈是侮辱她的尊嚴，愈是使那三位打牌的女客見笑！他怒不可遏地提起那雙穿著高跟皮鞋的腳，對準這個可憐的女人亂踢，一面厲聲喝著：</p>
<p>「給吾滾，給吾滾，這兒用不着你」！</p>
<p>「李家嫂，犯不著跟這種人生氣，吾們來打牌！」三位女客跑了過來，邊拖邊勸地把她拉來坐下。</p>
<p>那女人也停止了哭聲，爬起身來絕望地看着太太，終於提起沉重的腳步，遲緩地，遲緩地走了出去。</p>
<p>現在太太房裏的竹牌聲又淸脆地響起來了。</p>

<p>— 一華</p>
<p>在　椥</p>
<p>是深秋的時候了，我終於在蛛椥住了下來。</p>
<p>一個流浪者，一個生活的俘虜，當他謀到一件職業之後，心裏是說不出多麼愉快的。就是現在，回想到當日給梭椥某華僑請去當一名塾師時候那種驚喜若狂心情，亦還是感到稍微的快慰的。</p>
<p>椥是安南六省之一，其實不過鄉間一個較大的市鎭罷了。假如從高處一望，校椥定像一個孤島週圍是綠楚葉般的海洋。在這樣一個沒有市聲的喧囂的市鎭上住下來，生沽的確是另具風味的</p>
<p>我們的店裡是在河邊早上給三個小孩說了一些故事之後，就把「千家詩」打開來，給他們講解，敎他們誦讀。當我們念到「秋盡江南草未凋」的時候，生長在異邦的孩子們固然沒有何種感觸，但我却不自禁地要朝窗外望過去了：外面，河的彼岸，正是一片無涯的綠色的海洋，隨着陣風，長長的野草掀起了柔和的波浪。秋行將盡了，江南的綠草那時節亦許微黃了吧，但這里却依然是靑翠的，靑翠得像初春。</p>
<p>午飯後，店裏的人大打瞌睡了。我却挪了一隻椅子，借着簷影，面河坐了下來，痴痴地，如有所失地，凝望着河那邊的高高的椰林，靑天和白雲。</p>
<p>「你是在異邦了呵！」看着這充滿異國情調的風光，我便向自己這樣低語了。對岸，時常有一些面色黎黑，赤裸着上身，在腰間圍着一條紅色的圍布的安南人在來往，他們搖擺著走，手裏長而微彎的鐮刀在閃閃地發光。看見這光景，時常使我不自覺地幻想起古代的情景來。</p>
<p>在　椥，再沒有比星星更使我愛好的了。入夜，微風送來了一陣陣不知名的草香，那時候深藍的太空上繁星正在閃眼私語。它們是那樣小，那樣璀璨，小得，確璨得像針尖一般都呌人看不慣。在天幕的俯蓋之下，我呆呆地坐着出神。要是一個流浪過的人，他就曉得在這樣的景色中，來到我的腦際的，定是親友的想念同家鄉的懷想吧。</p>

<p>——那可不容易；因為放在你　子上的雖然有三張，卻代表著二種不同的性格，不同的情緒，不同的人格；張張都好，我知道你在這許多照相裏，也會選出這三張的。你瞧，不是，不是他們代表三種不同的個性嗎？這一張，不是有那種幽麗的南歐的，西班牙的情調嗎；這張不是代表了一個現代的俐聰的女學生嗎？這張不又是呈露著一種多智的老成的，經過了一番的現代型的少女嗎？三張各有不同，各有好處，那鬥我選那一張給你呢？</p>
<p>——不錯，你說的全不錯，可是你曉得我要那一張。</p>

<p>「…………」</p>
<p>革命軍人的姨太太，比作軍閥的姨太太不知道那一個好。一得了，別傻了，姨太太還不是姨太太，老爺還不是老爺，中國還不是中國！</p>
<p>「買賣還不是買賣！」</p>
<p>「對了，買賣總是買賣……」</p>
<p>上面是「買賣」裏隨便抄錄下來的幾句對話，瞧；多麼有意味兒，其實，這還是在討論著他們「買賣」中間的戲謔而已。雖然說是戲謔，可是在目前這年頭看起來，也還覺得非常中肯，而且像這一類的故事也發生得很多，所差者就是「中國還不是中國。」</p>
<p>可巧的又是劇中的所謂「買賣」現在正走著紅運呢！</p>
<p>國際風雲不是一天緊張一天嗎麼？那些做軍火商「買賣」的是如何的在私相競爭著，這給於他們是一個發財的機會呀！</p>
<p>對了，「買賣」也就是這樣的在告訴你們聽。</p>
<p>做着軍火「買賣」之一的洋行買辦梅希俞，為了想販出一大批軍械，發一次洋財，在一個旅館裏和他的同行買辦陶近米，計劃怎樣把他的妹妹梅可卿當著一件禮物去孝敬一個姓宋的參謀長，希祈著他們軍火「買賣」的成效，千方百計，把妹子騙到旅館裏，而迫她入　。但是所難的卻是她太懂得世故了，不為利誘所動，然而他們怎肯放鬆呢？終於設阱招到她的愛人潘雪圭，以禁錮他作為對她的要挾條件，可卿想於欲救愛人而畢竟實踐了她前面「咳，由不到革了命的女子還是要實」！這句話被自己的哥哥合夥「賣」掉了！</p>
<p>可是他們事先佈置得很週到，計劃很縝密使人覺得一點破綻都沒有，這不能不深佩這一班人詭計的巧妙啊！</p>
<p>我們據看過「買賣」在舞台上演出的朋友說：梅可卿是因為愛慕虛榮而跟宋參謀長走的。我們不敢贊同這個見解。讓你們聽下去吧！想一想「女子還是要賣」的根原吧。</p>
<p>這算是「買賣」的介紹。</p>

<p>— 葉可</p>
<p>小嬌子李萍倩編導的「桃李爭艷」，原是「情書」改名的，這個戲，從牠的題名看來，就夠使人陶醉，而牠的內容，不但有曲折的故事，且有更加使每一個青年男女懂得多一點的戀愛法則，這裏，來介紹一些片段的戀愛座談：</p>
<p>尤光照的戀愛秘訣　願蘭君（茉莉）跟王徵信（鐵夫）結婚的那天，男寶相是尤光照王吉亭孫徵李清四個人，這一天，會客室的一角，尤大胖子跟他們幾個人在開戀愛座談會，他們談到蘭君跟徵信的婚事，又談到為什麼硬性的王徵信會娶願蘭君這樣一個彈性的女人，於是他們的對話中，我們可以知道大胖子尤光照是最懂得戀愛秘訣的一個人：</p>
<p>孫：真想不到，鐵夫（王徵信）會娶這一們小姐（願蘭君），而且忽然問就訂婚了！</p>
<p>尤：那也沒有什麼希奇，男的有這個（指　指腦），有這個（指指他那壯碩的身體），女的有這個（指指臉蛋）有這個（用手作金錢狀）！</p>
<p>孫：可是以前不是他跟大小姐（葉秋心）打得火熱的嗎？怎麼又變了呢？</p>
<p>尤：因為大小姐有這個（指指臉蛋）可沒有這個（用手勢作金錢）！</p>
<p>王吉亭的戀愛經，他們講到這兒，那個專門玩弄女人的魔鬼王吉亭也參加意見了，他的話也許是很合於現代的一般青年的戀愛的表現：</p>
<p>王：不是我吃豆腐，要是我呀，我要二小姐，不要大小姐，愛情本來就是刺激，能夠刺激男人的，就是懂情的女人，你看這位二小姐，那種魄力，那種手段。</p>
<p>孫：談到手段，就不是真愛情了！</p>
<p>王：你懂得什麼，你要有手段才能夠表現！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Young Soldiers Launch a Sudden Rebellion: Four Japanese Ministers Assassinated; Okada, Saito, and Watanabe Killed; Takahashi Seriously Wounded; Tokyo Declares Martial Law; Military and Police Cooperate to Maintain Order; Interior Minister Goto Concurrently Appointed Acting Prime Minister <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai News: It is learned that this morning at dawn, three thousand soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the 1st Division stationed in Tokyo occupied the Cabinet Office. The private residences of Prime Minister Okada and Interior Minister Saito, as well as the guard posts of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the National Police Agency, resisted, but were subdued due to being outnumbered. The authorities have dispatched soldiers from the Imperial Guard Division to clear out the rebels. Prime Minister Okada, Interior Minister Saito Makoto, and Director-General of Education Watanabe Jōtarō were killed, and Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was seriously wounded. It is reported that the 1st Regiment recently received orders to go to Manchuria. When stationed domestically, they were only issued blank cartridges, but now they have been issued live ammunition. According to sources, this violent coup was orchestrated by young military officers in the army. A state of martial law has been declared throughout Japan. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th: At 8:15 PM, the Ministry of the Army released the following details regarding the Tokyo incident:</p>
<p>This morning around 5:00 AM, a group of young officers attacked the following locations: the Prime Minister's official residence (Prime Minister Okada killed on the spot), the Interior Minister's private residence (Interior Minister Saito killed on the spot), the Director-General of Education's private residence (Director-General Watanabe killed on the spot), the Yumoto Itoya Inn, where former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino was staying (Count Makino's whereabouts are unknown), the residence of Chief Aide-de-Camp Suzuki (Chief Aide-de-Camp seriously injured), the private residence of Finance Minister Takahashi (Finance Minister injured), and the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun.</p>
<p>It is said that the purpose of these officers' uprising is because they believe that in this time of grave internal and external crisis, the elders, senior ministers, zaibatsu, military cliques, bureaucrats, political parties, etc., are the main culprits in destroying the national polity. Therefore, they must be eliminated in order to correct the great righteousness, uphold the national polity, and strive for reform. Regarding the above incident, troops stationed in Tokyo have been mobilized to implement extraordinary security measures, etc. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: An unprecedentedly serious coup occurred in the Japanese capital of Tokyo on the morning of the 26th. Nanjing received a brief report around 10:00 AM, and all parties were extremely surprised and concerned. However, due to Tokyo's blockade of communications, the detailed situation could not be known. Many parties in our nation's capital went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about details, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a detailed report from the embassy in Japan as of tonight, presumably also due to the communications disruption. The reports from consulates outside Tokyo are all vague. The Japanese embassy in Beijing and other foreign embassies have also not received reports, so it is generally believed that the situation in Tokyo is extremely serious. All are now eagerly awaiting the dissemination of detailed reports and are closely monitoring its development. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: News of the Tokyo coup arrived in Tianjin. The military and consulate officials were all in a state of panic. Japanese residents were uneasy. Japanese newspapers were prohibited from publishing such news. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Local News: Regarding the violent coup that occurred in Tokyo this morning, here is a statement issued by a spokesperson for the Japanese Ambassador to China:</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, several army officers suddenly commanded a small number of troops to attack the Prime Minister's official residence, the Minister of Finance's official residence, the Minister of the Army's residence, the Director-General of Education's residence, the Interior Minister's residence, the Metropolitan Police Department, and other locations. As a result, Prime Minister Okada, Interior Minister Saito (former Prime Minister), and Director-General of Education Watanabe were killed, and Finance Minister Takahashi was seriously injured. Other than this, there are no other abnormalities in Tokyo. Transportation is normal, and although the stock exchange temporarily suspended gatherings, the financial world remains stable. Banks and other places are operating as usual. This incident was an action by a portion of people expressing dissatisfaction with the government's policies and does not have any revolutionary overtones. There is no concern that it will expand in any way, nor will it have any impact on the foundation of the Japanese Empire. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Shanghai News, Reuters: Reuters received news from Beijing stating, "It has now been learned from reliable sources here that Finance Minister Takahashi was one of the Japanese cabinet members who was killed. Takahashi was already eighty years old. Takahashi's murder provides insight into the masterminds behind this violent coup. Takahashi was the most vocal opponent of the large military budget. Takahashi advocated opposing unlimited financial expansion to fund the programs desired by extremists. The Japanese business and financial communities strongly supported him. However, the young faction of the military, which has recently participated in extreme right-wing and fascist organizations, opposes Takahashi's conservative policies and is becoming increasingly active. This is likely one of the causes of Takahashi's death." (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Details of the Japanese Coup <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai News: Japanese Prime Minister Okada, 82-year-old Finance Minister Takahashi, and former Prime Minister Admiral Saito were all killed by rebel soldiers in Tokyo this morning. The rebel soldiers, numbering three thousand, belonged to the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Division. This morning, they suddenly separated and occupied various government offices, the Prime Minister's and Interior Minister's residences, and the Police Headquarters. Although the Imperial Guard has been ordered to quell the rebellion, it is believed that the rebel soldiers still occupy various government offices near the Imperial Palace. After the incident occurred, martial law was declared throughout Japan. The Osaka and Tokyo stock exchanges were both closed. All overseas telegrams and radio transmissions were subject to strict censorship. However, news of the coup continued to leak out and was transmitted to Shanghai. The initial warning came to this newspaper from Tokyo, stating only that a military coup had occurred in Tokyo and that several important political leaders were reported to have been killed. This newspaper repeatedly attempted to communicate with Tokyo by wireless telephone but was unsuccessful, receiving only the reply that the telephone lines were damaged. The first official announcement regarding the coup was relayed from Singapore in the afternoon. It stated that the Japanese consulate in Singapore announced a Japanese Foreign Ministry document from Tokyo, stating that at 5:20 AM, several soldiers of the 1st Division acted without orders from their superiors, and Admiral Saito, Prime Minister Okada, and Finance Minister Takahashi were assassinated. Military Education Director-General General Watanabe was seriously injured. Former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Count Makino and Imperial Chamberlain Suzuki Kantarō were attacked but managed to escape. Prince Saionji Kinmochi, Army Minister Kawashima, and Grand Chamberlain of the Imperial Court Yuasa Kurahei are all safe. The situation is expected to calm down soon. The commander of the rebel soldiers is Colonel Nonaka Shirō.</p>
<p>Japanese troops stationed domestically are usually only issued blank cartridges. However, because the 1st Division was recently ordered to proceed to Manchuria, they were issued live ammunition. This morning, as the 3rd Regiment of that division was proceeding to the station to board trains to their destination, the soldiers suddenly mutinied and, under the guidance of officers, rushed to various key locations in Tokyo. Their occupation of the Ministry of the Army and other government offices did not seem to encounter any resistance. However, according to some reports, looting and arson occurred after the coup broke out. Looking at information from all sides, Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Koki were undisturbed. Although Interior Minister Goto's official residence was occupied, he was not assaulted. The murder of Finance Minister Takahashi was definitely primarily because he opposed the military budget. He did not advocate unlimited monetary expansion to cope with the military programs planned by the extremists. This position was strongly supported by the Japanese business and financial communities. A Reuters dispatch from Beijing stated that, according to news from Manchuria, the Tokyo coup was not against the Imperial Family. The rebel soldiers have declared their support for the Emperor. Dōihara Kenji's secretary told people that Dōihara had heard news of the coup but did not know the details. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>The Great America Evening News also said that this Tokyo incident is a recurrence of the so-called Divine Soldiers Incident from a year and a half ago. At that time, the instigators were mostly young army and navy officers. They planned to bomb the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the Prime Minister's residence, and kill several cabinet members, bankers, and party leaders, then set fire to important public works. These people believed that this would create a riot, allowing the declaration of martial law, and then the military authorities could seize full power to issue orders. Later, one of the conspirators leaked the news, and the police discovered it, so it did not succeed. Finance Minister Takahashi was one of Japan's leading financiers, with great foresight. He strongly opposed the huge military budget, which was resented by the fanatical young officers in the military. Therefore, it is most regrettable that he was the first to die in this incident. As for the consequences of this incident, it is not yet possible to predict, but one thing is certain: every time such an incident occurs, the power of the civilian faction in domestic policy is weakened, and the power of the military cliques is increased. As to whether this incident will lead to a war in the near future, only time will tell.</p>

<p>London: News of the Tokyo coup has greatly shocked Britain. Although the news from Reuters is very brief, all morning newspapers that were published slightly later, upon receiving this telegram, printed it in large characters. The first reaction of people here is that the violent coup in Tokyo indicates that extremist military personnel have gained the upper hand. This trend could make Russian-Japanese relations even more dangerous. Although the Japanese embassy in London had not yet received direct telegrams by 10:00 AM this morning, there was an endless stream of calls from all sides inquiring about details. Japanese officials in London will hold a meeting to discuss the situation after receiving the details. Currently, these Japanese people deeply regret the deaths of Okada and Takahashi, but they say that this coup was launched by young officers who have no connection to military affairs.

<p>Moscow: Since the incident in Tokyo, political figures here are deeply uneasy, fearing that Japanese power will fall into the hands of the country's military.

<p>Rome: After news of the Japanese military rebellion reached here, political figures believed that as an incident occurred in Japan, a friendly country, at a time when the actions taken by Soviet Russia in Geneva aroused resentment among the general public, if Japan were to conflict with Soviet Russia, then Italy's sympathy would naturally be with Japan. If turmoil were to occur in the Far East again, it would indeed be due to the lack of unified action by European countries. In Britain, although its interests in the Far East are very important, its navy is actually concentrated in the Mediterranean. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Paris: After this morning's incident in Tokyo, political figures here deeply feared that Japan and Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia would have turmoil again. However, they believed that according to the Franco-Russian mutual assistance agreement, France must wait until Soviet Russia's western border is invaded before it comes to assistance. France does not bear any obligations regarding Soviet Russia's Far Eastern border. The National Assembly is currently discussing the ratification of the Franco-Russian mutual assistance agreement and will discuss the Japanese incident, but there will be no change in the position on this agreement. It is also believed that the Japanese military rebellion was due to differences of opinion between the Civil Affairs Party and the military regarding the Manchuria issue. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Political figures commented on the Japanese military rebellion, saying that this matter was caused by differences of opinion between the government and the military regarding Soviet Russia. Since Soviet Russian Deputy Commissar Stomonyakov refused the participation of third countries in the Outer Mongolia issue (referring to those outside Manchuria and Mongolia), Japanese military personnel have been advocating a more radical policy in "Manchukuo" and northern China. In addition, there is recent talk that Major General Doihara Kenji, chief of the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency, will be promoted to lieutenant general and transferred to another post. As a result, the military and the parliamentary system are increasingly incompatible. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>Geneva: After news of the Japanese military rebellion reached here, League of Nations personnel were shocked, fearing that Far Eastern peace would be most seriously affected. League of Nations personnel have been closely paying attention to the development of the Far Eastern situation for the past few months and have been hoping that China and Japan will achieve something when they hold a meeting in Nanjing in the future. Now that an incident has occurred in Tokyo, the international political situation will inevitably be greatly affected. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The military coup in Japan is considered extremely serious here. If this movement succeeds, a major war in the Far East may occur, and it may soon involve the League of Nations, because Russia has anticipated the possibility of war in the Far East and has therefore eagerly joined the League of Nations, so that it can invoke Articles 10 and 11 of the League of Nations Covenant and raise this matter. It is feared that the Tokyo coup will have an impact on the meeting of the Committee of Eighteen on March 2 to discuss the oil embargo against Italy, because there is now a larger event brewing in the Far East, and members of the League of Nations must urgently seek an early resolution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute.

<p>Tokyo: Since taking office, Army Minister Kawashima has devoted all his efforts to unifying and purifying the Ministry of the Army, and he is now actively working to achieve his goals. In view of Japan's international isolation since the Manchurian Incident, and the fact that this state is likely to continue for a considerable period, the Army Minister has taken every opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Okada, Finance Minister Takahashi, and others to advocate the establishment of an unshakeable national policy to cope with the internal and external situation. Now that the general election has come to an end, and Prime Minister Okada has decided to deal with the extraordinary situation, Army Minister Kawashima plans to propose important national policies within days, in order to implement them concretely. It is said that the content is roughly as follows: Since the Manchurian Incident, Japan's actions have caused various countries to harbor feelings of suspicion, jealousy, and opposition. As a result, relations with Britain and the United States have become more complicated and difficult. Japan should establish a national policy to address these future difficulties, decide on national affairs, and avoid divisions in national strength and public opinion. Whether seeking development on the continent or attempting to advance towards the ocean, unification based on national policy should be a prerequisite, and it is an important duty of the current cabinet. To carry out this national policy, it goes without saying that it is essential to strengthen national defense and military preparations. The military spending issue is not only a matter for the financial authorities to consider but also an important decision for the entire nation. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Observations on the Great Coup in Japan <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The turbulent Japanese political situation has now undergone a dramatic change. The news has shocked us. The severity of this coup is beyond comparison with the May 15th Incident. It is difficult to predict how it will develop in the future, but by examining the past Japanese political situation, we can learn some of the meanings of this coup. Please allow me to explain them separately:</p>
<p>First, since the September 18th Incident, young Japanese soldiers have gained power due to the gradual victories in foreign aggression. They even want to seize all political power. Therefore, they first created the May 15th Incident, and now they have expanded it and caused this huge change. The May 15th Incident was a fierce attack by young military groups on parliamentary politics, while this incident is a decisive battle between radical elements in political parties and right-wing military groups against elders, senior ministers, and stable elements in political parties. In other words, it is a decisive key moment in the rise and fall of fascist forces and the power of feudal nobles and industrial capitalists.</p>
<p>Second, although the brewing of this incident was not a day's work, the most recent reasons for promoting this coup, according to our observation, are several: The result of the recent general election was that the Minseitō won a great victory, and the position of the Okada Cabinet turned stable, which was the opposite of the desire of young Japanese soldiers to have the Okada Cabinet resign immediately. Moreover, there was a special phenomenon in this general election, that is, the old bureaucratic and aristocratic forces strengthened their alliance and suppressed young soldiers under the slogan of "national unity and cooperation." The murder of Nagata Tetsuzan in July last year was a serious warning from Japanese reservists to the stable faction of the military. This matter has not yet been resolved, and the situation has become more complicated. When General Masaki Jinzaburō, the leader of the young military faction, appeared in court on the 25th of this month as a witness in the Nagata incident public trial, he refused to answer the judge's questions because they involved official secrets and angrily withdrew from the court. However, the defense side insisted on Masaki clarifying the truth, and the government also intended to investigate the matter. Recently, Russian-Japanese relations have been tense. The opinions of the young faction of the Japanese military were in obvious opposition with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and senior ministers. The young faction of the military intended to fight Russia without hesitation, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and senior ministers believed that Russian-Japanese relations must be eased. The young faction of the military believed that the Okada Cabinet was weak and incompetent and must be overthrown. Dr. Minobe Tatsukichi, whose theory of the Emperor as an organ of the state became the target of attacks by various factions of the military, was assassinated on the 21st of this month but was not killed. The arrested perpetrator admitted that he was related to right-wing violent military groups. With these four reasons, yesterday's huge coup was facilitated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the targeting of Finance Minister Takahashi and Prime Minister Okada as the main targets of the assassination has its important reasons. We all know that the military is strongly advocating the healthy naval and army theory, advocating expanding armaments as much as possible, while Finance Minister Takahashi is a powerful figure in opposing the unlimited expansion of the military budget and has won the support of the Japanese business and financial circles. Although Prime Minister Okada came from the military, his policies were consistent with the senior ministers. Since taking office, he has made considerable efforts to suppress right-wing military groups. As of the end of August last year, the number of people arrested in violent groups has reached more than 20,000. (According to China United News Agency) The resentment of right-wing military groups has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>The causes of this coup are extremely complex, and its impact on Japanese politics will inevitably be significant. The future evolution will have a significant reflection on the entire China-Japan relationship. This is what we must pay attention to.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Florentine's Speech: Supporting the Franco-Russian Agreement, Collective Security Maintains Peace, Not a Military Alliance, Welcoming Germany to Participate in Cooperation <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Paris - French Foreign Minister Florentine delivered a brilliant speech in the Chamber of Deputies today, supporting the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement, stating that this agreement is not a military alliance, but only a confirmation of the Locarno Pact and a stage on the road to peace. After Florentine's speech, the entire left wing and most of the central party cheered enthusiastically. When the new agreement is voted on by the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow, it will undoubtedly be passed. However, the Foreign Minister failed to sway the opposition of the right wing parties, who were reluctant to have any close alliance with Moscow. They belittled the Soviet Union's military strength and did not want to provoke Germany unnecessarily. However, the Foreign Minister stated that he intended to submit the question of whether the agreement complied with the Locarno Pact to the Hague Court for a ruling, and therefore won a victory.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, Florentine stated that once the agreement was passed, it would consolidate the organization of European collective security. France has never given up its willingness to invite Germany to participate in understandings aimed at safeguarding peace. All previous governments have been faithful to this concept, and have always been careful to keep Germany's access open. The agreement does not contain obligations that can be found in alliance treaties, and does not violate the spirit of the Locarno Pact. The agreement confirms the Locarno Pact and declares that it must not be aggressive towards Germany. The agreement only seeks to resist aggressors. Florentine then quoted government statements, declaring and referring to cooperation with the Germans. His conclusion was: "A great country that owes so much to culture should be restored to an equal position in the world. This is what we desire." (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris - This afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Chamber of Deputies convened, continuing the debate on the ratification of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Foreign Minister Florentine, after several days of Chamber meetings, addressed the various criticisms of the treaty. At today's meeting, he personally delivered a speech to provide a general response. The speech was very long, lasting two hours. The gist of his remarks was, "Signing the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty is our inherent right. If Germany formally challenges our recognition of this right, we will submit this issue to the Hague International Permanent Court for a ruling." He then outlined that since 1920, the French government's entire policy has been to advance towards the goal of maintaining peace through the path of collective security. Collective security is the objective pursued by the League of Nations. Although there have been changes in successive governments, this policy has remained consistent. As for the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, all countries except Germany view it with a sympathetic attitude, because this treaty does not go beyond the framework of the League of Nations, and it is open for all countries to join. Moreover, the two signatory countries of the treaty have agreed to abide by any proposals put forward by the League of Nations. Therefore, it cannot be compared with the offensive and defensive alliances before the European War. If critics argue that if something happens in Eastern Europe, France will be bound by this treaty and drawn into the vortex, the answer is that at the beginning of the Great War in 1914, the motive for the outbreak had nothing to do with us (referring to the assassination of the Austrian Crown Prince). If countries such as Britain and Italy had adopted a selfish and isolationist stance, they could have stood idly by and not joined our side. Therefore, concluding a mutual assistance treaty and being drawn into a war vortex should not be confused."</p>
<p>Florentine's conclusion was very moving, asking the deputies not to mix domestic political issues with foreign policy. For example, the Italian political system and the Soviet political system are diametrically opposed, but the friendly relations between Italy and Russia are very clear. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the political situation, observing the situation in the Chamber of Deputies, when the Chamber votes on this bill, although the number of votes in favor may not be as many as those who have consistently supported the government's foreign policy, it will undoubtedly be a majority. Generally speaking, the Chamber of Deputies will vote to pass the ratification on Thursday, and then send it to the Senate. Repeated debates in the Senate will also take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty may not be ratified by both houses of parliament before March 3. By then, the Chamber of Deputies' re-election is approaching, and the current session will soon end. If it is delayed in this way, the stance of France and other countries on this treaty may change.

<p>Berlin - Informed sources here believe that Germany will not formally challenge the Locarno Pact at present.

<p>London - Today, newspapers here are filled with reports that as a result of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement and the Anglo-French sanctions policy against Italy, European powers may draw a new divide. Newspapers also carry rumors from Rome that after Mussolini's meeting with the German Ambassador to Italy, Hassel, a compromise has been reached. If the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement is passed by the French Chamber of Deputies, Italy and Germany will take joint action. The general impression is that a group of five countries, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Poland, is currently being formed in Rome. Italian authorities and diplomatic circles in Rome acknowledge that extremely important secret negotiations are currently underway. It is said that after Hassel's meeting with Mussolini, the Polish Ambassador to Rome immediately visited Mussolini and suddenly returned to his country. Suvich, the Austrian Foreign Minister, who unexpectedly met with him in Florence last week, is now planning to reciprocate with a visit to the Hungarian capital. Therefore, Italian diplomacy, which had not focused on European affairs since the start of the Italian-Abyssinian War, is now fully active again. It is widely believed that Mussolini is now trying to make all countries feel that if the Stresa Front collapses, there will be dire consequences. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome - Political circles here dismiss with a smile the rumors that Italy and Germany have reached an agreement challenging the Locarno Pact. However, newspapers are still filled with threatening remarks, saying that if sanctions against Italy continue, Italy will eventually challenge the Pact. They also claim that the possibility of Poland joining the Italy-Germany group is currently being discussed. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Since Prussian Premier and German Aviation Minister General Goering recently visited here, the issue of Poland joining an agreement with Germany has attracted much attention. However, due to disagreements between the two countries, although the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement has been severely criticized by Poland, Poland does not seem likely to accept Germany as its new comrade.

<h3 id="e23">Important Anglo-Belgian Talks <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>London - According to our correspondent, important talks are currently being held here between Britain and Belgium. The Belgian representative is Count de Lantsheere (who attended the funeral of the late King George V), and the British representative is Mr. Sargent of the Foreign Office (who was a member of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919). The following issues are considered important: If the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty is ratified by the French Parliament, Germany may demand revisions to the regulations regarding the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland and the Locarno Pact. What stance should Britain and Belgium take at that time? According to Belgian sources here, the Flemish people of Belgium are now vigorously advocating that Belgium should revert to a neutral system, guaranteed by Britain, Germany, and France, just as it was before the European War. (Note: Belgium has two ethnic groups, one is the Walloon people, who belong to the Latin system and whose language and customs are similar to those of France, and the other is the Flemish people, who belong to the Teutonic system and are close to the Dutch people).

<p>Britain Plans to Conclude a Tripartite Naval Treaty with the United States and Germany, in Order to Threaten France and Italy into Submission, but France Insists on Concluding a Quadripartite Agreement, Negotiations in London are Still in Complicated Discussions</p>
<p>London - The Associated Press learned from reliable sources today that Britain has informally suggested that if the London Naval Conference fails, Britain, the United States, and Germany should conclude a naval agreement. It is said that this proposal is the result of Britain's dissatisfaction with the European political issues raised by the French and Italian representatives. Today, the U.S. representatives refused to discuss their feelings about this proposal. If Britain, the United States, and Germany form an agreement, they should exchange documents and reserve space for future conferences, and Japan and Russia may be invited to participate. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>London - France is extremely opposed to Britain's proposed tripartite naval treaty between Britain, the United States, and Germany, which would leave France and Italy out of the picture. Therefore, it has put forward another proposal today: The current London Naval Conference can only conclude a quadripartite agreement, limited to Britain, the United States, France, and Italy. Only in this way can France join in signing, and Italy can follow suit. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>London - The London Naval Conference today discussed the renewal of the naval treaty between Britain and Germany, in order to prevent the naval conference from reaching a deadlock due to European political issues. France opposes inviting Germany to sign the treaty. In order to accommodate France's wishes, there is now a positive proposal to suggest that Britain and Germany conduct separate negotiations on qualitative aspects of the treaty to supplement the existing quantitative aspects of the treaty between Britain and Germany. It is reported that Mr. Craig of the British Foreign Office has discussed this with the naval attaché of the German Embassy today. This solution can reconcile the opinions of Britain, the United States, and France. If Italy can also comply, the naval treaty can be signed and submitted to Japan. However, Italy has stated that it is unwilling to sign the treaty while sanctions are in effect. This attitude has not changed, so it is expected that the discussions on the oil embargo in Geneva next week will be closely related to Italy's attitude at the London Naval Conference. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Official circles today implicitly indicated that if the tripartite naval treaty does not hinder the interests of Germany in the Anglo-German naval agreement, Germany will welcome the tripartite naval treaty. There are three reasons why Germany welcomes this tripartite agreement: 1. The establishment of this agreement can recognize Germany's claim to be a first-class naval power. 2. It can show the consistency of Germany with other Anglo-Saxon nations. 3. It can show the different trends of Britain, the United States, and France. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>London - Those close to the naval conference negotiations are now worried that the return of Italian chief delegate Piaccia to London may bring the naval conference to a standstill, and the qualitative restriction plan that has actually been agreed upon will be hindered. Most of the qualitative compromises are based on the standards of existing treaties, with the only exceptions being the stipulation that cruisers will be 8,000 tons instead of 10,000 tons, and aircraft carriers will be 23,000 tons instead of 27,000 tons. The largest financial savings are only in the cruiser area, with an estimated savings of 300,000 pounds per vessel. However, the savings originally hoped for by Britain were even greater than this, and focused especially on battleships. Britain's battleship limit was 25,000 tons, but the current agreement is for battleships of 35,000 tons, a difference of 3 million pounds. The scope of Britain's rearmament program and its extent can only be announced by officials next week, but private estimates put the cost at 300 million pounds, with the navy accounting for the largest share. It is heard that Britain will use the entire empire as a unit to manage armaments, so the establishment of a naval agreement is very important. Only with this can there be a solid foundation for official estimates. The methods proposed by France and Italy are not welcome. The future naval treaty will be accompanied by a protocol, explaining the desire and method of seeking the signatures of Japan, Germany, and Russia in the future. The current difficulty lies in the drafting of this protocol. France believes that allowing Germany to participate in the naval conference is tantamount to recognizing the existence of a German navy that deviates from the law, and forgiving Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles, so it has always been unwilling for Germany to join. There are now rumors that Germany intends to reoccupy the demilitarized Rhineland area to counter the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement. France's attitude of rejecting Germany's participation in the naval conference will not change because of this. France is now willing to sign any naval treaty first, but requires the insertion of a clause in the protocol, the main purpose of which is to make France's final signature conditional on the establishment of a general European arms agreement. Italy has the same view, and also requires a method regarding sanctions, which has aroused opposition from the US representatives. The US representatives have stated to British Foreign Secretary Eden that they came here to sign a naval treaty, and the US position does not allow it to participate in European disputes. Looking at the above situation, people here are mostly worried that the naval conference discussions are nearing a deadlock, and the results already obtained may be lost. Last night, British Foreign Secretary Eden repeatedly stated in the House of Commons that Britain would soon be engaged in a large-scale rearmament. This statement has aroused speculation about who will be the head of the new national defense agency in charge of the army, navy, and air force. Some people expect former Foreign Secretary Hoare to be the head, but today's newspapers say that Finance Minister Neville Chamberlain is the most promising. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London - Informed sources predict that the development of the naval conference will reach the following two results: 1. Britain, France, Italy, and the United States will sign a qualitative naval agreement. 2. Britain and Germany will separately establish a special agreement, with each country agreeing to fulfill the provisions of the four-nation agreement. However, some people fear that Germany may take the opportunity to demand a reward, and may request revisions to the provisions of the Locarno Pact and the demilitarized zone along the Rhine. If so, the negotiations will inevitably be delayed. Today, someone spread rumors that if the naval conference fails, Britain will sign a treaty with the United States alone, or even with Germany. This statement was denied by responsible naval officials, who said that this news was due to a misunderstanding of the recent developments in the naval conference. As far as is generally known, Britain is currently conducting negotiations with Germany, and its purpose is to get Germany to sign and join the four-nation agreement. If Germany agrees, it is sufficient to add a clause to the Anglo-German naval agreement (signed last June) to clarify it, so that France can avoid signing a naval agreement with Germany, and the naval provisions of the Treaty of Versailles will not be violated. This is the best of both worlds. Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Germany, it is now known that the first decision was made last night at the German Embassy in Britain, and the second decision was made at 4:00 PM today at the Foreign Office. The British representative is Craig, a specialist at the Foreign Office, and the German representative is Wiesner, the naval attaché of the embassy. According to reports in the German capital, Germany has not opposed this negotiation process. Based on the above circumstances and the information obtained by our correspondent this morning, it can be summarized into two points: 1. A qualitative naval limitation agreement can be signed by Britain, France, Italy, and the United States this week. 2. Britain originally planned to seek Germany's consent before signing the four-nation agreement, but has now abandoned this plan. The above two pieces of information can be said to have been confirmed.

<p>— Shao Shiping</p>
<p>Land Relations and Taxes in Sichuan</p>
<p>In people's minds, Sichuan always seems to be a chaotic world or a mysterious place, and few people have paid attention to it. Since the "Red Bandits" sneaked in, followed by the army's suppression, the voices of developing Sichuan have also risen, coupled with Mr. Ding Wenjiang's high opinion of "retreating to China's Kamchatka (referring to Sichuan, Guizhou)" Then Sichuan was noticed by everyone.</p>
<p>Sichuan is the largest region in the inland eighteen provinces, and various modes of production still exist: such as Songpan, the Russian side of Luo Bian and other places, still living a nomadic life. In the southwestern border of Sichuan, many places still have the remains of ethnic economies. And Chongqing has fully demonstrated the sprout of capitalism. But for the most part, it stays in the semi-feudal rural economy. What is described in this article is only this part</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the National Government's Accounting Office, the total area of ​​farmland in the province is 96,272,000 mu, the soil is fertile, and rice, soybeans, vegetables, fruits, tobacco, tea, hemp, cotton, etc. have great outputs. The area of ​​japonica rice in the province is 41,515,000 mu, which can produce 132,451,530 zu (100 jin). The area of ​​glutinous rice is 4,332,000 mu, which can produce 12,924,290 dan of rice. Soybeans can produce about 9 million dan, and cotton 600,000 dan. The production volume of other items is also very large. Therefore, calling it "Tianfu" is indeed "consistent with its name." However, since the Republic of China, more than 400,000 soldiers have been raised in Sichuan, and warlords have fought each other in more than 470 large and small battles. In this process, the semi-feudal relations of production have played a powerful role, and exorbitant taxes, high rents, and heavy exploitation have become increasingly rampant. Disasters of waterlogging, drought, soldiers and bandits have further accelerated the collapse of the rural economy. The peasants, under this multiple oppression, had no choice but to lose their land, flee, and starve. On the other hand, land rights are concentrated, thus brewing a serious problem.</p>
<p>1.  The Process of Land Concentration</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe the extent to which land rights have been concentrated in Sichuan. However, on the one hand, there is no appropriate statistical data at present. On the other hand, "Sichuan soldiers are all big landlords." This is what we are used to hearing. For example, Yang Sen, Deng Xihou, etc., none of them are not "land connected by thousands of acres, fields separated by several counties." Their property is "rich enough to rival a country." Don't Liu Xiang and others have their own banks? Naturally, their land cannot be investigated. Generally speaking, landlords occupy more than 70% of Sichuan's land, which will not be too far from the truth. For example, in a relatively affluent Changshou County, the number of landlords and rich peasants only accounts for 15% of the total, and the land occupied accounts for 78%: the number of poor peasants is 65.9%, and the land occupied accounts for only about 8%.</p>
<p>Landlords and rich peasants, especially in Sichuan, are inconvenient to separate. Because they are often one and the same. And Sichuan also does not have large-scale tenant farming by rich peasants, so we calculate them together. Here we can clearly see that the landlords and rich peasants, who account for the least number of farming households (15.7%), occupy nearly eight-tenths of the land. The poor peasants, who have the largest number of entries (65.9%), own less than one-tenth of the land. The depth of land concentration can be imagined.</p>
<p>The statistics of 2,763 village households surveyed in Ba County in the 23rd year, although not very accurate, can also tell us the same result. According to these statistics, there are 171 landlords with more than 100 mu of land (less than 7%). Among them, there are 3 large landlords with more than 1,000 mu, 66 with more than 500 mu, and 57 with more than 200 mu. There are 94 households with more than 50 mu of land, 348 with more than 20 mu, and 350 with more than 10 mu. There are 1,500 households with less than 10 mu, accounting for nearly six-tenths of the total village households. Among them, the most pitiful poor peasants with less than 5 mu are 1,110 households. Under the current production situation in Sichuan, ordinary village households with 20 mu of land are only enough to support a family of eight. And now in Ba County near Chongqing, those with less than 10 mu account for six-tenths, naturally they are all poor peasants who cannot support themselves.</p>
<p>However, the terrible situation does not stop there. As a result of years of internal chaos and exorbitant taxes and levies, the degree of poverty among peasants is deepening day by day. At first, they sold grain and pawned clothes and furniture to cope. Finally, they had to pawn or sell their only means of production—land—to fill the insatiable desires of warlords and landlords. Therefore, as they are running on the road to landlessness day by day, land rights are continuing to concentrate faster. We only need to see the number of self-cultivating farmers decreasing year by year, and the number of tenant farmers increasing year by year, and this fact can be fully exposed.</p>
<p>Table of the increase and decrease of tenant farmers and self-cultivating farmers in Sichuan (see Agricultural Information Report of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute)</p>
<p>Year % of Tenant Farmers % of Self-Cultivating Farmers % of Semi-Self-Cultivating Farmers</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 1 51 30 19</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20 56 25 19</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 21 58 23 19</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 22 59 22 19</p>
<p>It can be seen that except for the semi-self-cultivating farmers who have not changed, the proportion of tenant farmers is increasing year by year, while the number of self-cultivating farmers is decreasing year by year. According to another statistic (see Oriental Magazine, Volume 24, Issue 16), tenant farmers in northern Sichuan accounted for only 28% of the total number of farmers in the first year of the Republic of China. By the 13th year of the Republic of China, it increased to 35%. Let's say it's 50% now! (According to the statistics of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, it is 59%) Then its rate of increase is really amazing. But in any case, this is precisely proving that the degree of polarization is developing. At the same time, we also need to point out that the reason why semi-self-cultivating farmers have not changed is not because their situation is particularly good. In fact, they are also on the road to landlessness, but only because the decline of self-cultivating farmers makes their proportion not much change!</p>
<p>2.  Tenant Relations</p>
<p>As mentioned above, landlords occupy at least 70% of Sichuan's farmland, and the proportion of tenant farmers is around 60%. However, these many tenant farmers can never be compared with agricultural capitalists who operate on a large scale in Europe and the United States. Undoubtedly, they are making a living on zero-scale land. Perpetual tenancy and contract tenancy coexist. The high rent forces the tenant farmers' lives to deteriorate day by day. Now let's look at the situation in Ba County.</p>
<p>Rent Rate and Amount of Rent Paid by Tenant Farmers in Ba County (Surveyed in the 23rd Year)</p>
<p>Normal Yield Annual Yield Annual Money Rent Official Rent Additional Products Tax Payment Additional Products Deposit</p>
<p>Superior Land 18 Dou 10 Dou 17 Yuan 70% 2 Yuan 10 Yuan</p>
<p>Medium Land 15 Dou 8.5 Dou 10 Yuan 60% 1.5 Yuan 8 Yuan</p>
<p>Inferior Land 14 Dou 8 Dou 5 Yuan 50% 8 Jiao 6 Yuan</p>
<p>Ba County is close to the metropolis of Chongqing City, but the high rents in the countryside are simply unbelievable. The lowest is 50%, and the highest is more than 70%. The tenant farmers' products are not only completely occupied by the landlords in the surplus value part, but even the wage part is also deprived. Who can still recognize this as capitalist rent?</p>
<p>Let's cite Rong County to see its tenancy situation.</p>
<p>1.  Money Rent - Dry land is 3 yuan per mu per year, and fenced gardens are 4 yuan.</p>
<p>2.  Produce Rent - Paddy fields are 1 Shi per mu per year, and dry land is 2 Dou.</p>
<p>3.  The percentage of the harvest amount - Paddy fields are 70%, gardens are 50%, and dry land is 30%.</p>
<p>4.  Extra demand - There are local products such as chickens, ducks, vegetables, and fruits as gifts.</p>
<p>5.  Rent reduction measures in famine years - The tenants prepare a banquet and invite the landlord to inspect. At the time of rent collection, the landlord unilaterally decides, dividing 60% for the landlord and 40% for the tenant, or 70% for the landlord and 30% for the tenant.</p>
<p>Oh my god! The rent is so high, but it doesn't count, and you have to receive a huge amount of interest-free deposit; it doesn't count, and you have to give extra gifts; it doesn't count, and you have to invite the landlord to eat wine in famine years; it doesn't count, and you have to do several days of unpaid labor for the landlord in many places; it doesn't count, and you have to pay taxes for the landlord! (For example, in Jianyang, although the landowners pay the regular grain for the land tax, the various additional taxes are divided 60% for the landlord and 40% for the tenant, or half for the landlord and tenant, or even completely borne by the tenant farmer. However, this is not very bad. In many places, even the regular grain is paid by the tenant farmer.)</p>
<p>In addition, there is a way of exploitation that cannot be named, so it is called "hard knocking." Extract a section of the Sichuan Provincial Government's circular to clarify the truth: "...In the ninth year of the Republic of China, Cheng Rentian Flower Rui Temple Property (later returned to the Education Bureau - author) An Rentian (deposit - author) was 3,200 strings. At that time, the value of silver yuan was 2,100 to 2,200 Wen per yuan. According to the current price, it should be converted into more than 1,450 silver yuan. In the 19th year, an additional deposit of 2,800 strings was added. At that time, each yuan was worth 15 strings, which should be converted into 186 yuan. This year (the 21st year), when the tenancy was withdrawn, the Education Bureau only refunded 400 yuan in foreign currency, resulting in a loss of more than 1,200 yuan." This kind of "hard knocking" method is indeed rare to hear in other provinces, but it is very common in Sichuan. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Nanjing A delegation of over a hundred people from the National Silverware Industry Petition Group arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 26th. At 10 AM, they went to the Central Party Headquarters to petition for amendments to the silver usage regulations and to exempt them from restrictions on the silver content in their products. Secretary-General Ying received them and agreed to forward their petition to the chief secretary for review and instructions. At 11 AM, they went to the National Government, where Jiang Shenghuai was appointed to receive them. At 2 PM in the afternoon, they went to the Executive Yuan, where He Jizhi, the head of the Protocol Section, received them. At 3 PM, they went to the Ministry of Finance, where Dai Mingli, the Director of the Currency Department, and Liu Chengzheng received them. Dai agreed to forward their opinions to Minister Kong and also stated three points: 1. The regulations on the management of ornamental silver issued by the Ministry of Finance are based on the government's overall policy, and the silverware industry should understand this. 2. According to the Ministry of Finance's research, there is no technical obstacle to using 30% pure silver in the crafting of jewelry. 3. Silverware businesses are asked to strictly follow the silver content regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Finance and conduct thorough experiments. If the results show real difficulties, the silverware industry should draft a concrete plan based on the actual situation and submit it to the government for joint consultation, or a slight increase may be considered. At 4 PM, the entire group went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects. At 6 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by the Beijing Silverware Industry Association. They returned to Shanghai that evening. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>— Professor Huang Guozhang, Department of Geography, Central University</p>
<p>The above is a theoretical discussion. Now, let's take the geographical background of Japan's expansion overseas as an example to illustrate how important geographical knowledge in the late Ming Dynasty was for understanding international relations!</p>
<p>Japan is an island nation located only one day's sea journey from China. Although its area is less than 150,000 square miles, it has a population of 64 million, averaging over 400 people per square mile. The population per square mile of cultivated land is even higher, around 2,500. The density of the population can be imagined. Japan is not only densely populated, but also its population is increasing rapidly, with an annual increase of between 900,000 and 1 million. Since Japan is an island nation surrounded by the ocean on all sides, its land area cannot be expanded. Therefore, Japan's population problem has always been very serious.</p>
<p>There are three possible ways to solve Japan's population problem: strengthen the productive capacity of the country's land, engage in domestic and international migration, and seek large-scale development of the country's industry. Now, let's explain them one by one.</p>
<p>Expanding farmland – All plains and gently sloping hills have been reclaimed as farmland for growing grain. Experts estimate that Japan still has 4 to 5 million acres of arable land, half of which could be developed into rice paddies and could supply food for 20 million people. In other words, it could accommodate Japan's population increase within the next 20 years. However, according to statistics from 1905 to 1925, Japan averaged less than 100,000 acres of reclaimed land per year. It is undoubtedly impossible to develop all 4 to 5 million acres of wasteland into fertile land within 20 years.</p>
<p>Increasing the yield per acre of farmland – The yield of Japanese crops per unit of cultivated land does show an increase, but it is far less rapid than the population increase. Moreover, the productivity of land has a certain limit and cannot increase indefinitely like the population.</p>
<p>Domestic migration – 1. Migration to Hokkaido: The population distribution on the main islands of Japan is not very even, and there are still many sparsely populated areas. The population density of Hokkaido is only one-fifth of the average population density of the country. Therefore, the Japanese government has planned to encourage migration to Hokkaido. However, the climate in Hokkaido is very cold and unsuitable for people from central and southern Japan to live there. As a result, this plan failed. 2. Migration to places like Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin Island: Japan has seized a lot of land from our country, accounting for 60% of the area of the main islands of Japan, and Korea and Taiwan are the main parts of it. These places are better than Hokkaido, with climates similar to those of central and southern Japan, and similar products. It should be easy to move the surplus Japanese population to these places, but the population of these places is already very dense, with more than 210 people per square mile, and Taiwan has even more than 360 people. Moreover, the living standards of the people in these places are lower than those of the Japanese, making it difficult for the Japanese to compete with them in terms of living. In addition, the population growth rate in these places is higher than that in Japan. According to statistics from 1925, the increase rate per thousand people in Japan was 13.4, in Korea it was 26.1, and in Taiwan it was 18.6. Because of these various factors, these places cannot accommodate many Japanese immigrants each year. Since Korea became affiliated with Japan, the average number of Japanese immigrants each year has been less than 15,000. After 1915, the average number of Japanese immigrants to Taiwan has been even less than 5,000. Compared with Japan's annual increase of 900,000 to 1 million people, it is really not helpful. In addition, Japan seized the southern part of Sakhalin Island from the Russians, which is even colder than Hokkaido, and the Japanese are even more reluctant to go there. After the European War, Japan gained the right to manage several islands in the Pacific Ocean that formerly belonged to Germany because of its contribution to the war. However, although these small islands have military value, they are not enough to accommodate a large number of Japanese immigrants. Since the takeover, only about 30,000 Japanese have resided on those islands.</p>
<p>Overseas migration – In 1931, the total number of Japanese overseas residents was no more than 750,000, which is less than the number of people Japan increases in one year. Moreover, these overseas residents also include many Koreans and Taiwanese, as well as Japanese students studying abroad, diplomats, and naval and army personnel. The formal number of overseas residents is only about 700,000. Compared with the 630,000 overseas residents in 1926, the increase was only 120,000 in five years, with an average of only 24,000 people per year. Among these immigrants, 70% were engaged in reclamation in the Amazon River basin in South America, which is sparsely populated, due to the Japanese government's various rewards and the Brazilian government's preferential treatment. But everyone knows how unsuitable the Amazon River basin is for habitation, as it is a hot and humid forest area. It is within our expectation that Japanese immigrants cannot develop greatly here. In North American countries, the Japanese could have competed with white people by taking advantage of their lower living standards, but the Japanese are not only unwelcome in these countries, but also the restrictions on immigration mean that this path is impassable. In the Philippines, the South Seas Islands, and the Northeast region of our country, the Japanese feel that the competition from the Chinese and other local people is too fierce, and they cannot live there for long. From this, it can be seen that although domestic and overseas migration can help with Japan's population problem, this assistance is ultimately limited, and other plans must be made.</p>
<p>(5) Developing industry – Developing industry can directly increase national wealth and indirectly use this wealth to buy various living materials from abroad, accommodating the increased population. Industrial development has relatively no end and is the best way to solve the population problem. Therefore, since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has followed in the footsteps of Britain and actively engaged in industrial development. Now, it has achieved great results. The development of the cotton weaving industry is second only to that of Britain and the United States, and the prosperity of the silk manufacturing industry is the highest in the world. Other industries, such as the steel industry, shipbuilding industry, and paper industry, all occupy a considerable position internationally. The number of domestic workers has increased by an average of 47,000 people per year from 1894 to 1926. The degree of national industrialization has become more and more significant. Today, Japan has indeed become an important industrial country in the world.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why Japanese industry has been able to develop, but the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the three major battles of the European War are the biggest keys: As a result of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894-1895, all unequal treaties were cancelled, and Japan's national prestige was enhanced. All kinds of undertakings have since risen, and the manufacturing industry has also risen under various conditions such as the acquisition of Korea and Taiwan, the expansion of the market for goods and raw materials, and the government's implementation of protectionist tariff policies. As a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-1905, Japan jumped to become a first-class power and obtained economic interests in South Manchuria. Its national strength became even stronger, and its industry also developed rapidly. In the European War of 1914-1918, Japan took advantage of the troubles in the West, which had no time to look eastward, and expanded the Eastern market as much as possible. Industry showed even more rapid progress. During the war, the number of workers increased by an average of 160,000 to 170,000 per year, and it eventually became one of the world's major industrial countries. This can be said to be a heaven-sent opportunity for the development of Japanese industry. In addition to the victory in foreign wars, other factors such as the development of overseas shipping, low labor costs, and the rise of hydropower projects have all promoted the development of Japanese industry.</p>
<p>Although Japanese industry has developed rapidly, there are many crises lurking ahead, and it is really not optimistic. Although there is no shortage of workers and labor costs are very low, technical skills are inferior compared to Europe and the United States. Moreover, the country's wealth is not very large. The average annual income per person is not only lower than that of the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, but is simply less than half of that of Italy, so domestic purchasing power is very weak. But these are not the biggest dangers. The lack of raw materials and the lack of energy sources are the biggest blows to the development of Japanese industry. The reserves of iron ore are not large, and the annual output is not enough to supply even one-tenth of its own needs. The rest must be supplied from Korea, China, and the Malay Peninsula. The cotton required by the cotton spinning industry comes almost entirely from the United States, India, China, and other places. There is very little domestic production, and cotton imports always account for the largest share of Japanese imports. Wool is also rarely produced domestically because pastures have been converted into farms and there are very few sheep. Coal and copper are two of Japan's most important mineral products. Although there are large reserves of coal, the quality of the coal is poor, and very little can be used for coking. The import volume of copper is also greater than the export volume. The reserves of oil are also very scarce, and the production volume is one-tenth of the consumption volume. Only a portion of hydropower can be used for industry, and when the river flow is at its lowest, the total hydropower volume is only 6 million horsepower, which is not enough to make up for this shortcoming.</p>
<p>One reason why Japan promoted the realization of the puppet state of Manchukuo and is so eager to expand its influence in the provinces of North China is that North China and Northeast China are both coal and iron producing regions of China. The abundance of geographical advantages and the convenience of transportation are no less than the Rhine River basin in Europe. It is the center of heavy industry in the Far East in the future. By obtaining Northeast China and North China, Japan can not only make up for its lack of coal and iron and develop heavy industry on a large scale, but also make the whole of China a permanent sales market for Japanese heavy industrial products, and the surplus products can be sold to all parts of the world at low prices. If China loses Northeast China and North China, the development of domestic heavy industry will be declared hopeless, because other than these two regions, it can be said that there is no second coal and iron producing region in China, and it is impossible to find a second coal and iron producing region that is so abundant in both coal and iron.</p>
<p>Japan's expansion of influence in North China is not only due to the need for coal and iron, but also for the supply of cotton raw materials and for finding a market for the surplus grain in Northeast China. Originally, the agricultural products of the provinces in Northeast China were mainly soybeans, wheat, sorghum, and corn. Soybeans have a world market, while wheat, sorghum, and corn not only do not have an international market, but are also not needed by the densely populated areas of Japan. What Japan needs is rice and cotton, and cotton is the foundation of Japanese industry and is not produced within Japan, so the need is even more urgent. The growing season in the three northeastern provinces is too short, and most areas cannot grow cotton, which cannot supply all of its needs. The crops in North China are the same as those in Northeast China, and it is also a major cotton producing area. If a large amount of cotton is planted in North China, it can not only supply the needs of its own textile industry, but also the grain needed in North China can be supplied by Northeast China. The cotton can be transported to Osaka, processed, and then transported back to North China and Northeast China to supply the people's need for clothing. It can really be called a win-win situation. In addition, another reason for Japan's expansion of influence in Northeast China and North China is to prevent the southward expansion of Soviet Russian influence. This point will not be discussed for the time being due to time constraints.</p>

<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>15. Customs of the Mongol and Hui People in Ningxia</p>
<p>In Ningxia, Mongol and Hui people live together, and the etiquette and customs of their society are deeply rooted in religion. Compared to Han customs, they are vastly different. Here, I will record the unique customs of weddings, funerals, and seasonal observances to provide reference for scholars studying folklore.</p>
<p>Mongol Customs: Courage and a fondness for fighting are hereditary traits of the Mongolian people. Farming is naturally unsuitable for them. However, Mongolians possess strong physiques, making nomadic life, roaming freely in the vast deserts, perfectly suited to their nature. They spend their days wandering in the embrace of nature, herding sheep, tending camels, and managing horses. Living under the open sky and sleeping on the ground, they feed on mutton and reside in tents, moving with the availability of water and grass. This lifestyle necessitates a strong physique, so they rarely fall ill and are almost ashamed to be sick. They lack medicine and medical care, relying instead on heating stones to cauterize themselves, allowing nature to heal them. Their sole faith lies in the Buddha statues and Lama monks enshrined in temples. The following describes Mongolian weddings, funerals, and their annual reverence for Buddhist lamas. (A) Weddings and Funerals: They first meet in private, without parental involvement or matchmakers. Love is extremely free, with horse racing and betting determining the outcome. Dowries are lavish, with cattle, sheep, and wealth held separately by each spouse. Marital discord requires minimal formalities for divorce. Funerals involve sky burials or cremations. After the death of parents, sons and daughters gather to weep and express their grief fully. They consult a Lama to determine the burial site. For sky burials, the corpse is left in the mountains or desert, and they observe the area the next day. If the corpse is completely consumed by birds and beasts, it is considered a good omen; otherwise, they mourn and move the body to another location, asking the Lama to chant scriptures and pray until the corpse is consumed by beasts, thus averting misfortune. For cremations, the corpse is taken to a mountain slope with a pit, a stove entrance is opened beside it, and the corpse is placed inside to be burned. Sons and daughters loosen their braids and wear their clothes inside out for a month, without visiting the grave or holding memorial services. On anniversary dates, they invite Lamas to chant scriptures and pray. (B) Seasonal Observances: On "New Year's Day," they go to the temple to kowtow to the Lama, return to their yurts for tea, and then return to the temple to circle it more than ten times. The sick lie prostrate on the ground, circling once or twice. They do not give New Year's greetings or invite relatives and friends for tea, and they avoid lending fire to others. On the fifteenth day, they all go to the Great Lama to be blessed by a touch on the head. The Lama uses a wooden pole with red cloth tied to it to strike people randomly. Those who are struck appear delighted, while those who have not been struck wait patiently, often for four or five days. On June 15th, they again go to the Great Lama for blessings and strikes. In all the temples, from the first to the fifteenth day of the first and sixth lunar months, Lamas chant scriptures. The Great Lama sits high on a platform, chanting scriptures, while thirty-two people in colorful robes and python robes of various colors, representing celestial kings, bodhisattvas, ox-headed demons, horse-faced guardians, and other figures, dance on the temple platform. First, trumpets and horns are blown, and drums and music are played, welcoming them in pairs from within. They dance on the altar and use fried noodles and butter to knead a naked human figure, placing it on a triangular wooden plate lined with triangular silk. One of the celestial kings uses a small wooden sword to dismember it. After the chanting is finished, they are sent off with drums and gongs, far beyond the temple, one or two miles away, before returning. On this day, temple officials collect donations from Han and Mongolian people. At the New Year, they take river ice and stack it against the walls, connecting piece by piece. On "New Year's Eve," they burn incense and chant scriptures in their rooms. Those who have lost their parents kowtow and weep before the whole family sits together for tea and then sleeps.</p>
<p>Hui Customs: Hui people are diligent and clean, abstaining from tobacco, alcohol, and other vices. They possess a martial spirit and adhere to Islam, i.e., the "Islamic" religion. The translated meaning of "Islam" is peace. Islam regards the "Quran" as its most precious scripture, which can be considered the constitution of Islam and the basis of faith for Muslims. The following is a summary of the unique aspects of the marriage, funeral, and seasonal customs of the Hui people in Ningxia. (A) Weddings and Funerals: Marriage is not selective based on wealth, only choosing good and virtuous families. Matchmakers convey proposals and inquire about family backgrounds, establishing kinship and using engagement gifts to confirm the arrangement. Religious leaders are invited to write the marriage contract, and a day or two before the wedding, the bride's family prepares the dowry, sending messengers to decorate the groom's house. The amount of the dowry usually follows religious guidelines, with the daughter receiving half of what a son would inherit. On the wedding day, the bride is presented to the groom's parents, and the groom presents gifts to the bride's family. When parents are critically ill, there is silence inside and outside the house. The sick person is placed in the main room, and the children constantly recite the Quran. According to Muslims, this is to remind the sick person to focus on the faith and not be attached to the world. During the critical moment of passing away, the departure of the soul, no negligence is allowed. Once the person has passed away and is at peace, a mourning altar is set up, and funeral directors are hired. Clothing is changed in the room, and guests are not entertained for three days, nor is food prepared. Relatives and friends send food. Relatives, neighbors, and friends offer condolences and gifts. The burial clothes consist of three pieces for men and four pieces for women, all made of fine white cloth, regardless of wealth or status. A coffin is prepared, and the grave is dug without regard to feng shui or auspicious timing, with the burial taking place within three days. On the morning of the burial day, the deceased's body is washed, dressed, and placed in the coffin, which is then taken to the mosque. Religious leaders and guests perform funeral rites. At the grave, the filial son inspects the grave and prays before sealing the burial. After the burial, memorial services are held on the 7th, 40th, 100th day, the anniversary, the third anniversary, and the anniversary of the birth and death, with visiting the grave, chanting scriptures, giving alms, and scattering grain as the essential ways of filial piety. (B) Seasonal Observances: Islam calculates a year based on the sun's journey around the sky in 365 and a quarter days and nights. A year is calculated based on the moon's journey in twelve months, which is 354 and a third days and nights. The solar year is used for determining seasonal events, while the lunar year is used for recording human affairs. Therefore, all ceremonies are calculated based on a twelve-month cycle. Islam firmly believes in creation, with a single true God in heaven and earth who is not physical nor empty. He is supremely intelligent, infinitely subtle, without beginning or end, the great source of human nature and life, and the origin of all existence. The main tenets of faith include belief in God, belief in prophets, and belief in scriptures. There are five duties to worship God: "Remembrance," to never forget the true God; "Prayer," to pray five times a day, always purifying oneself before each prayer; "Fasting," to fast for a month each year, rotating every three years; "Alms," to give alms to the poor and needy each year; and "Pilgrimage," to make a pilgrimage to the holy land of Islam.</p>

<p>Simultaneously Takes Office as Commander for Bandit Suppression in Dalah Banner</p>
<p>Over Five Hundred Han and Mongolian Attendees</p>
<p>Rong Xiang Exhorts Princes and Dukes to Serve the Country</p>
<p>Communication from Guisui: Zhasak Kangda Dorji of Dalah Banner recently held a swearing-in ceremony at the Suiyuan Hotel for his dual appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Seven Banner Allied Forces of Ih Meng League and Commander for Bandit Suppression in Dalah Banner. Over five hundred Han and Mongolian dignitaries attended. Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan Province represented the central government in administering the oath. Shakdurjab, the head of the Ih Meng League, also attended to deliver instructions. Princes Wang, Shi, E, and all the princes and dukes from various banners in Suiyuan attended the ceremony and delivered speeches, making it an unprecedented event in the border region. Among the speeches by the princes and dukes, the one by Rong Xiang, the chief administrator of Tumet Banner, was considered the most valuable. Rong Xiang possessed profound knowledge of Chinese classics and excelled in parallel prose, earning him the reputation of "Literary Giant of the Border Region." In his speech, from the perspective of a Mongolian and with the attitude of a scholar, he elaborated in detail on the historical contributions of the Mongolian people to the establishment of the nation and the preferential treatment the nation had given to the Mongolian people. The full text of his speech has been compiled and is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"Today is the day when Zhasak Kang of Dalah Banner is commissioned to hold the swearing-in ceremony for Commander-in-Chief of the Seven Banner Allied Forces of Ih Meng League and Commander for Bandit Suppression in Dalah Banner. I am deeply honored to be invited to attend this grand ceremony. As a Mongolian and a scholar, I would like to offer some humble contributions to Commander Kang and the princes, dukes, and chief administrators, based on the perspective of a Mongolian, the attitude of a scholar, and my thoughts today. I often hear our Mongolians from various leagues and banners mention that we are descendants of Genghis Khan, the Great Yuan Taizu, as a way to promote the achievements of our ancestors and prove the glory of our race. Historical records show that Genghis Khan was a great hero who shook ancient and modern times and conquered Europe and Asia. Not only do the Chinese know this, but people as far away as Europe and America are also familiar with him and admire him. Furthermore, according to the biographies of Mongolian princes and dukes, all hereditary princes and dukes of the various leagues and banners in Inner and Outer Mongolia are either descendants of Genghis Khan or descendants of his meritorious officials. Therefore, the princes, dukes, and all Mongolians of today are pleased to mention the achievements of Genghis Khan, considering it a glory of their race. This can be considered a well-founded claim, not simply using the power of a tiger to intimidate the masses. However, there is a point that we Mongolians should reflect on and that I must announce to you. No matter how great the character of our ancestors, no matter how vast their achievements, if the descendants themselves have no achievements to show to the world, then the glory and greatness of the ancestors still belong to the founding ancestors. For the descendants themselves, apart from serving as material for boasting, it is ultimately empty and useless, as the saying goes, 'It cannot fill your stomach.' Therefore, all of us who are descendants of the Great Khan should not forget the glorious deeds of our ancestors. At the same time, we must each strive to make some great and glorious contributions to the country, the region, the society, and the nation, so as not to be unworthy of being sacred sons and divine grandsons. In addition to highlighting the achievements of our ancestors, we will also have indelible achievements of our own. Furthermore, considering the historical positions of the princes and dukes, we need not discuss the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Even in the previous Qing dynasty, the princes and dukes of all our leagues and banners were granted titles and ranks that were hereditary. Was this achieved without reason? It was because, at the beginning of the Qing dynasty's entry into the Central Plains, the ancestors of our leagues and banners helped the Qing court to quell the bandits and pacify the regions, either by providing troops, donating horses, or personally leading troops into battle to help the Qing dynasty lay its foundation. Therefore, the current status of the princes and dukes was earned through the hard work and meritorious service of the ancestors of each banner. Regarding the countless contributions and efforts of the leagues during the Qing dynasty, it is impossible to recount them all. Taking my own banner, Tumet, as an example, when Prince Yu of the Qing dynasty, Dodo, used cavalry to attack the bandit Zhang Xianzhong, our banner donated thousands of horses, which led to the suppression of the bandits. During Emperor Kangxi's campaign against Galdan in the thirty-fifth year of his reign, the Uyi League, the Tumet Banner, and others sent cavalry to participate in the campaign, ultimately pacifying the great threat and ensuring peace on the border. Therefore, on the day of his return, Emperor Kangxi heavily renovated the temples in the banner territory and left behind armor, bows, arrows, swords, spears, saddles, and bridles as mementos. After the mid-Qing dynasty, when the Taiping Rebellion broke out, troops were often conscripted from our banner to assist in the battles. In total, seven thousand strong men were sent in three separate instances. After the rebellion was quelled, only about a thousand soldiers returned. Such was the case for our banner, and other banners had similar experiences. As for the eastern leagues, such as the Zhe Meng League and its subordinate banners, their sacrifices and losses were undoubtedly greater than those of our western leagues. From these past events, we can see that although the Qing dynasty treated our leagues and banners generously, the Mongolians repaid them in kind. In summary, based on the principle of reciprocity, the princes and dukes of our banners can be said to have earned the titles and honors bestowed upon them by the previous Qing dynasty. Since the establishment of the Republic of China more than twenty years ago, the nation's preferential treatment of the princes and dukes of the Mongolian banners has only increased. Not only were regulations created, but they were also put into practice. Princes of the second rank were promoted to princes of the first rank, and princes of the first rank were given double salaries. All other dukes, beile, beizi, and zhenfu were promoted according to the regulations. Since the establishment of the National Government, the central government's treatment of the princes and dukes of the Mongolian banners has been even more preferential. To ensure their self-preservation, security commissioners were established for them. To ensure their self-governance, local political committees were established for them. The nation spends countless public funds each year, only to ensure the survival of the Mongolians. The nation treats us Mongolians even better than the previous Qing dynasty. When we Mongolians search our hearts, can we say that our contributions to the nation are superior to our contributions to the previous Qing dynasty? Therefore, today, the princes and dukes of our banners, realizing the great kindness of the nation, should each strive to take on some responsibilities for the nation, so as not to simply accept the nation's grace without knowing how to repay it. I am also well aware that in the past twenty years, the leagues and banners did not lack the desire to repay the nation, but there were few opportunities. Although they wanted to contribute some effort, they did not know how. Fortunately, in recent months, Prince Pan and Prince Kang have taken on important roles in bandit suppression. This is an opportunity for the princes and dukes of our leagues and banners to strive to serve the country. If Prince Kang and the princes can understand the central government's sincere intention to support them and Chairman Fu's efforts to guide and promote them, and if they can strive together from the day they take office to achieve harmony and cooperation, so that both the Han and Mongolian people in the region can enjoy a peaceful and prosperous life, then devoting their efforts to their homeland is precisely the way to repay the nation. I am honored to participate in this grand ceremony and offer my humble opinions to the princes and dukes. May you consider them."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Ministry of Finance Recovers Salt Tax in Guizhou <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Annual Subsidies from Sichuan Salt Transport Administration for Military Expenses</p>
<p>Salt Merchant System in Guizhou Province to Be Abolished Immediately</p>
<p>Communication from Guiyang: The supply of edible salt in Guizhou Province has historically been rotated from Sichuan Province. The salt distribution system has sometimes adopted a merchant recognition (认商) and coastal recognition (认岸) system, and other times adopted a free trading system. However, the merchant recognition system has been especially harmful to the people. During the era of Mao Wang's rule, the merchant recognition system was mostly adopted, allowing merchants to manipulate the market and causing the price of salt to rise from one or two dimes per catty to as much as six dimes per catty, causing great suffering to the people. Last summer, the new provincial government was established, and Li Zhonggong, the director of the Finance Department, conducted extensive research on the selection of these two systems. In the end, he resolutely implemented the free trading system. However, reform takes time, and the regulations were complicated, so he did not succeed during his term. After Wang Zhengying took over as the director of the Finance Department, he planned to completely resolve the salt affairs issue. He repeatedly consulted with the Sichuan Salt Transport Administration to seek to restore the system of subsidies for military expenses. Before the subsidies and the new salt law were finalized, he extended the merchant recognition period for one year, from September 1, 1935, to the end of August 1936. Now that the subsidies have been finalized and the central government has recovered the salt administration, the free trading system can be implemented early. The circumstances of this process are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Subsidies for Military Expenses</p>
<p>After the central government recovers the salt tax in Guizhou Province, the Sichuan Salt Transport Administration will directly allocate 1.5 million yuan to Guizhou Province for military expenses each year, as well as another 120,000 yuan for educational expenses, totaling 1.61 million yuan. All taxes, surcharges, and expenses related to Sichuan salt in Guizhou Province will be suspended from February 1, 1936. The Salt Affairs Supervision Bureau and the inspection stations that specifically collect surcharges on Sichuan salt will also be abolished.</p>
<p>Agreement Contents</p>
<p>The full text of the agreement between the Guizhou Provincial Government and the Sichuan Salt Transport Administration on subsidy measures is as follows: The Central Ministry of Finance will designate 1.5 million yuan to be allocated to the Guizhou Provincial Treasury annually from the Sichuan salt tax revenue, to be allocated monthly by the Sichuan Salt Transport Administration. From the date of this agreement, salt merchant recognition in Guizhou Province will be immediately abolished, and merchants will be allowed to trade freely in accordance with the regulations. No one is allowed to manipulate or monopolize the market. From the date of implementation of this agreement, the surcharges on Sichuan salt in Guizhou Province and all miscellaneous taxes will be immediately abolished, and no institution or organization in the two provinces may collect fees under any name. From the date of implementation of this agreement, all salt affairs agencies under the jurisdiction of Guizhou Province will be abolished, and the Sichuan Salt Transport Administration will restore the Guiyang Supervision and Anti-Smuggling Bureau and the Tongren, Dushan, and Panxian Anti-Smuggling Sub-Bureaus. The Guizhou Provincial Government is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Sichuan salt in Guizhou and assisting in anti-smuggling efforts. Because the educational expenses in Guizhou Province are not covered due to the abolition of the surcharges on Sichuan salt, it is proposed to submit another case to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval, with an additional 10,000 yuan to be allocated monthly from the Sichuan salt tax. This agreement will be implemented from February 1, 1936, on a trial basis for one year.</p>
<p>Salt Affairs Office Abolished</p>
<p>Since the salt tax in Guizhou Province has been recovered by the central government and merchant recognition has been abolished, the Salt Affairs Office of the Finance Department and all salt tax collection agencies will be abolished from February 1st, according to a resolution passed by the standing committee of the provincial government, and will be closed by the end of February. Recently, the Salt Affairs Office of the Finance Department has been actively working to finalize various closing matters. The suspension of salt affairs expenses and surcharges has also been officially announced from February 1st. At the same time, the salt merchants of Renqi Yongsanan (仁綦永三岸) recently sent representatives Wu Luqin, Yang Fuxing, Liu Yaoxian, Ning Jisheng, etc., to the provincial government to present a petition, detailing the difficulties faced by the merchants in managing edible salt due to the establishment of the subsidies and the interruption of merchant recognition, and requesting the provincial government to find ways to provide relief. After receiving the petition, the provincial government submitted it to the 208th resolution meeting, handing it over to Mou Lin, Ye Yuanlong, and Wang Zhengying for review and approval.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Four Counties in Shandong Province Again Request That the Yellow River Be Allowed to Change Its Course <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Cutting Bends and Straightening the Riverbed for Perpetual Peace and Security</p>
<p>Shandong Provincial Government Forwards Letter to the Yellow River Commission for Review</p>
<p>Communication from Jinan: Since the Yellow River breached the people's embankment in Juancheng County and flowed east, returning to the correct course through the Huanghuasi Koumen along the former Yellow River channel for fourteen years, the shape of the Yellow River's outlet has changed, coinciding with the advocacy of Li Yiqi, the former Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. The people along the northern bank of the Yellow River embankment in Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and other counties have suffered heavy losses because the Yellow River has breached its banks and flooded into the Golden Embankment through Taochengbu. Now that the Yellow River flows east from Juancheng County and enters the river through Huanghuasi, it has naturally cut bends and straightened its course, making it the most suitable path. In the future, not only will the Golden Embankment be perpetually safe and secure, but also the dangerous engineering projects on the southern bank, such as Liuzhuang and Zhukou on the official embankment, and Lishengtun, Kangtun, and Lilou on the people's embankment, as well as Liuyuan and Liaoqiao on the northern people's embankment, can all be avoided. Therefore, they jointly implore the provincial government not to block the Juancheng people's embankment again, but to allow the Yellow River to change its course through Huanghuasi. Currently, Liu Yude and others, representatives of the people of these counties, have sent another telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the provincial government, reiterating their previous intention and criticizing the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's damming project by Kong Xiangrong, which has already failed. The old river is silted up, and it is already difficult to return to the old course. Even if it is forcibly closed, the breach this year will be either south or north, and the damming will be endless. They request that the Dongzhuang damming project be moved to repair the official embankment, so that the disaster areas of western Shandong and northern Jiangsu can be restored as soon as possible, and that the water be allowed to change its course. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government forwarded it to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission for review. The text of the telegram from the representatives of the people of the four counties is recorded below: "(Summary) The previous telegram and the report on the new breach of the Yancheng people's embankment taking a straight course should be understood. The reason for the urgent telegram is that according to Chairman Li's plan, Liuzhuang and Zhukou on the southern official embankment, and Lishengtun, Kangtun, and Lilou on the people's embankment, as well as Liuyuan and Liaoqiao on the northern people's embankment, will all be avoided, and there will be perpetual peace and security. If the Dongzhuang damming project is carried out, the breach this year will be either north or south, and the damming will be endless. Because the Dongzhuang damming project digs a diversion canal against the water flow, the small diversion canal has already been silted up, and the large diversion canal is even more ineffective, merely wasting labor and money. Moreover, the damming work is not even one-tenth completed. At this time, the work can be used to build the Taoshui Dam and move the damming to the official embankment. Moreover, the people of Juancheng along the old river, and the people south of the official embankment, as well as the people of Heze, Yuncheng, Juye, Dingtao, and Cao counties, all wish to move the damming. The Shandong Minguo Daily on February 14th reported that the water outflow from Huanghuasi was smooth, which can also be verified. And Qin, the county magistrate of Juancheng, previously dug the sixth gate of the official embankment to protect the Juancheng embankment, and now, taking advantage of the north wind, he is blocking the Juancheng gate, digging and blocking at will, which is clear upon investigation. Now that the old river is high and will soon stop flowing, the people of Hebei are boiling with resentment, and there is much public discussion. In addition to sending a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, we hereby submit a telegram. Liu Yude, representative of Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and other counties, bows."</p>

<p>Skyrocketing Exchange Rate: Joint Discussion of Relief Measures</p>
<p>The Wuxi Carriage Industry, Tobacco Exchange, Liquor and Sauce Shop, Meat Industry, and Native Tobacco Trade Associations, due to the recent skyrocketing exchange rate in the city, where each yuan can be exchanged for 3,170 copper coins, invited leaders from over ten trade associations, including the Sauce and Liquor, Southern Goods, Grain, and Noodle Restaurants, to jointly discuss relief measures on the 23rd. They decided to send a letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting the bank to accept exchanges, and stipulated that the market price of copper coins should be 3,000. The money markets in neighboring counties such as Suzhou, Changzhou, and Yixing are all lower than in Wuxi, averaging from 3,000 to 3,050. Shi Qinglin, the standing committee member of the Wuxi Tobacco Exchange Trade Association, went to Yixing to investigate the money market in order to understand the money market in the neighboring counties. He found that the money market in Yixing was 3,000, not as high as in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Dramatic Increase in the Number of Opium Addicts</p>
<p>Since the county launched the opium addicts' self-renewal registration, the number of opium addicts in each district has increased by more than 4,700. The existing opium dens are thriving, with opium smokers crowding in, making it difficult to cope. The county government has ordered each district chief to increase the number of opium dens as appropriate based on the actual situation in the area. After receiving the order, Qian Zhongliang, the first district chief, sent personnel to investigate. In addition to the existing dens, it is planned to add four more in Ximen Zhijie, Beitan, Malu, and Chong'an Temple. Yesterday, he reported back to the county government for verification.</p>
<p>Impersonating an Inspector Arrested</p>
<p>A middle-aged man came to the Wan'an Inn on Dongdajie in the city on the evening of the other day, wearing a black woolen cotton robe, a felt hat, leather shoes, a Vienna scarf around his neck, glasses, a badge on his chest, a fountain pen, and carrying a flashlight. He claimed to be an inspector from the Public Security Bureau and came to inspect the rooms. The inn believed him and handed over the guest registration book to the man. He first checked room number one and then number six. The innkeeper, Chen Jiadong, saw that he was not wearing a uniform and became suspicious. He asked to see his official documents but was unable to obtain them. He only took out a photo of the foreign comedic star "Laurel and Hardy," and realized that he was an impersonator. He immediately detained him and handed him over to the first branch of the Public Security Bureau for strict interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Guo Zhendong, from Anhui. Two round badges were found on his person, one reading "Strive to Save the Country" and the other reading "Central First Army Soldiers' Association Membership Badge," with the character "Constitution" in the middle. Two photos were found, one of Laurel and Hardy and one of Xu Lai. Eight business cards were also presented. Yesterday, he was transferred to the court for trial. It is reported that Guo's other name is Zhensheng, and he had previously impersonated a military officer in Danyang with Zhu Rongfu, defrauding people, and was detained by the Danyang County Government. He was released from prison on February 13th of this year.</p>

<p>Planning to Establish Public Slaughterhouse</p>
<p>The Provincial Capital Sanitation Office noted that butchers in the provincial capital often slaughtered pigs and sheep inside meat shops, on sidewalks, or in their homes.

The office considered this situation detrimental to the city's appearance and a significant hindrance to public health. The office plans to raise funds to establish a public slaughterhouse, which the Sanitation Office will help manage. Butchers in the provincial capital will then be able to slaughter pigs and sheep within the slaughterhouse. This will benefit both the city's appearance and public health. The office sent a letter to the Zhenjiang Meat Industry Association for consultation. If the association agrees, it will send representatives to negotiate. The office will then solicit bids from businesses to operate the slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>The British Royal Air Force, for the purpose of visiting China and Japan, specifically sent three flying boats led by Smith, the commander of the British Far East Air Force, departing from Singapore. Due to weather conditions along the way, the journey was repeatedly delayed. One boat, number four, was left in Xiamen for repairs due to engine damage and will not be able to continue the journey. The remaining two boats, numbers two and three, departed from Xiamen on the 24th. Due to unfavorable weather conditions, they were forced to land near Nanguan in Wenzhou. They took off from Wenzhou this morning at 10:05 AM and flew to Shanghai, landing at 2:05 PM this afternoon in front of the Zhoujiazui Island fish market in Yangshupu. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan on the 29th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel The British Embassy's Aviation Counselor's Office received news this morning that the two boats had left Wenzhou, immediately notifying all relevant parties by telephone. Zhoujiazui Island, which had been quiet, suddenly became bustling with traffic and excitement. Those who went to welcome the boats included Zhang Tingrong, representing Mayor Wu of our municipal government; Fan Wei of the Garrison Command; Hong Qi of the Public Security Bureau; Wen Changzhao of the Shanghai Flying Station; Aviation Commissioners Liu Fangxiu, Yang Guanyu, and Qin Zongshen; Wang Zhinan of the Municipal Security Office; Mr. Winock of the British Embassy's Aviation Counselor's Office; Mr. Fowles of the British Royal Aeronautical Society; Commander Iida of the Japanese Third Fleet Aircraft; Mr. Ashino Hiro of the Japanese Embassy's Intelligence Department; Mr. Yanagi and Mr. Hashizume of the Japanese Embassy; Mr. Walter of De Hansa Company; Mr. Gabaru of the Italian Embassy's Aviation Counselor's Office; Mr. Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation; and over two hundred other guests.</p>

<p>Landing Details Prior to the arrival, the Public Security Bureau dispatched a police team, and the Water Police Bureau also sent a water police team to maintain order at the scene. The Jianghai Customs Security Office also dispatched several small launches to greet the boats. Asia Petroleum Company also sent the Dian Guang small launch to the port for supply purposes. At 1:20 PM, the two flying boats suddenly appeared at the east corner of the Huangpu River, and the crowd craned their necks to look. The two aircraft flew west, one after the other, circling Shanghai once. After a short while, they turned back towards the fish market. The engine sound roared, and the aircraft circled the fish market once before gradually descending. Boat number two was in front, and boat number three was behind, landing in the river west of Zhoujiazui Island and mooring at the designated buoy. The landing was completed at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Reception by Various Parties Jianghai's Jinghui and Guang small launches, as well as the Security Office's security launches, all sailed to the river to greet the boats. The Aviation Administration also sent an aircraft to welcome the boats in the air. Zhang Tingrong, Winock, and others took the Hongmin small launch, towing two sampans, to welcome the boats. Commander Smith disembarked and went to the Jiao City Market to rest and meet with the welcoming personnel, offering them beer. He then went to the Cathay Hotel for rest. That evening, the British Chamber of Commerce and the embassy hosted a banquet in a private capacity. Due to the mourning period for King George of England, the event was kept simple. Tomorrow, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, Mayor Wu Tiecheng will host a tea party at his private residence.</p>
<p>Personnel Arriving in Shanghai The personnel who arrived in Shanghai yesterday included Commander Smith, team leader Scott, and officials Stewart, McLeay, Van Leichey, Lloyd, and Piper (on boat number two); Brighton, Rickert, Hunt, Holopen, Jimmis, Gibson, Warren, Stamfordley, and Howells (on boat number three), totaling sixteen people.</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters Commander Smith held a press conference at the Cathay Hotel, Room 533, at 5:00 PM yesterday, making the following remarks: "I am leading the British Royal Air Force flying boats on a visit to China and Japan. After arriving in Hong Kong, we were delayed for several days due to weather conditions, as you already know. We left Xiamen at 10:00 AM on the 24th. We were forced to land in Nanguan due to rain, staying for two nights (spending the first night on the boat). We were still blocked on the next day. We finally took off at 10:05 AM this morning (the 26th). Nanguan is a small place, but the scenery is picturesque. We also received hospitality from the local authorities there. The plane left in Xiamen has a damaged engine that will take time to repair. After it is finished, it will fly directly to Hong Kong. If the weather is good tomorrow morning, the 29th, we will fly to Kagoshima, south of Kyushu, Japan. We plan to fly from Kashima to Xia Pu next Monday, then to Tokyo, staying for four days. Then we will fly back to Kagoshima, and return to Singapore via Shanghai. I am deeply grateful to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Fish Market Department of the Ministry of Industry, and the Public Security Bureau of Jianghai Customs for their hospitality and various conveniences." Smith then answered reporters' questions, "I am the commander of the Far East Air Force, which includes Singapore and Hong Kong. The force consists of three groups, one group has four flying boats, two reserve boats, and the other two groups have twelve aircraft each." Smith reportedly participated in the European War and took office as the Far East Commander in 1933.</p>
<p>Flying Boat Equipment The flying boats that came to China this time were manufactured by the oldest British company, Short Brothers, and are suitable for flying over the sea. The boats are silver-gray and equipped with two engines, each with 560 horsepower. The durable cruising range is 2,350 miles, at an altitude of 2,000 feet, with a maximum speed of 145 miles per hour and an average speed of 105 miles per hour. The bow is equipped with gun positions and machine guns. The front of the cabin has two driver's seats, the middle is the pilot's seat, and there are also mechanic and radio operator seats, as well as cooking and storage facilities. The equipment is very complete.</p>
<p>Flying Route The three British flying boats left Singapore at 7:00 AM on the 10th of this month, arriving in Kuching at 11:30 AM that day. They left Kuching at 7:00 AM on the 12th and arrived in Kudat at 2:30 PM that afternoon. They left Kudat at 6:00 AM on the 13th and arrived in Manila at 1:00 PM. The third boat, due to engine damage, flew directly to Xiamen on the 19th. They left Manila on the 16th and arrived in Hong Kong at 1:30 PM that afternoon. They were delayed in Hong Kong for several days due to bad weather. On the morning of the 23rd at 9:30 AM, they left Hong Kong and arrived in Xiamen at 1:14 PM. After arriving in Xiamen, the fourth boat was left in Xiamen for repairs due to engine damage, and was unable to continue. The remaining two boats left Xiamen for Shanghai at 10:10 AM on the 24th. They were forced to land near Wenzhou due to fog. They flew from Wenzhou to Shanghai at 10:05 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Foreign Press Reports The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the two British flying boats took off from Nanguan, Wenzhou, at 10:00 AM this morning (the 26th) and arrived safely in Shanghai at 2:50 PM this afternoon, mooring near the fishing market at Zhoujiazui. They plan to stay for two days. It is said that the weather between Wenzhou and Shanghai was good this morning, overcast and calm. The six officers on board are staying at the Cathay Hotel, and the remaining ten are lodging on the Asia Petroleum Company's riverboat, Dianguang, moored at the New Fish Market pier. Because today is within the British national mourning period for King George, all receptions are informal. The two flying boats will fly to Japan after staying in Shanghai for two full days. The third flying boat is still stranded in Xiamen, awaiting the spare parts needed for repairs. All three flying boats are the Singapore Third-style, designed for long-distance sea reconnaissance. The crew can stay in the aircraft for several weeks. Each aircraft is equipped with four engines, with a maximum speed of 145 miles per hour and a cruising speed of 105 miles per hour. They can fly 3,000 miles in one stretch.</p>

He is currently 53 years old. He graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University in 1909 and then joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as Vice Consul in Fengtian. After that, he served as Consul, Foreign Affairs Officer, First Secretary of the Legation, and First Secretary of the Embassy, Consul General, and other positions in places such as Chicago, Ottawa, Honolulu, and Siam. While serving as First Secretary of the Embassy in Washington, D.C., he attended the Washington Naval Conference as the secretary-general of the Japanese delegation.

<p>Written Statement After arriving in Shanghai, Ambassador Arita immediately released a written statement to the press, translated as follows: "I have served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years. Twenty-five years ago, I served in Fengtian. Since then, I have worked in Beijing and Tianjin. In the Ministry, I served as Director of the Asian Affairs Bureau and as Minister, and have always been in charge of matters relating to China. This time I have been appointed to China, as if returning to my second home. The establishment of amicable relations between Japan and China is an absolute requirement for the peace and prosperity of East Asia. This is recognized by the people of both countries. At this time of crisis, it is admirable to seek a way to manage it well. And I deeply respect the hard work of my predecessor, Ambassador Ariyoshi. To establish amicable relations between the two countries, it is necessary for both sides to accurately recognize the real situation and implement the most appropriate adjustments. To achieve this goal, I sincerely hope to follow the policy of my government and do my best. However, I have been in Europe for more than two years, and I am somewhat estranged from matters relating to East Asia. As I take office, I will listen carefully to the opinions of officials and civilians from all sectors of both countries, and at the same time, I will carefully observe the situation in China and make appropriate adjustments, so as to avoid any regrets. This is what I sincerely pray for."</p>

The canal runs through the three counties, with a total length of no less than 200 li, serving as a sluice gate for draining accumulated water in peacetime, and is of utmost importance to the livelihoods of the people in the three counties. More than 500 villages along the canal, with a population of more than 400,000, depend on the canal for survival. In recent years, the Yellow River has breached its banks, and the three counties have suffered severely from floods, leaving the people in dire straits. Moreover, the canal has been silted up by the water, and accumulated water has stagnated, making it impossible to drain. As a result, whenever there are continuous heavy rains, floods run rampant, inundating countless fields and crops. The direct and indirect losses amount to millions. In the summer and autumn of this year, incessant rains raged, and accumulated water formed rivers along the canal. The people of the three counties suffered the same fate as the flood victims. The damage was no different from the breaches of the Yellow River in previous years. After this devastating experience, we deeply feel that dredging this canal is not only an urgent and pressing task, but also a fundamental plan for the next century. However, due to consecutive years of disasters, the people's livelihood is in decline, and public and private resources are exhausted. Although we have the intention to dredge, we lack the ability to implement it. After painful reflection, learning from the past, we have thought about ways to prevent disasters and maintain the people's livelihood. We have consulted in detail and unanimously agreed that your association has always been concerned about the disaster victims in the three counties, has repeatedly provided relief, and has helped the people in distress. All living beings are grateful for your reconstruction. If the benefits and harms of dredging the canal and the plight of the disaster victims are described in detail to your association, we sincerely request that you allocate funds to provide work relief and preside over the dredging and repair. If you approve, both the national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit. It has been decided to prepare separate plans and submit them jointly by the three counties, drawing a complete map of the canal, and requesting your association to review and instruct, etc. It is recorded in the file. We respectfully observe that your association has a charitable heart and is very concerned about the welfare of the people. This righteous act concerns the water conservancy of the three counties, benefiting them once and for all, saving hundreds of millions of lives from water and fire, and putting them on a bed of safety. Although a one-time allocation of funds is relatively large, it is better to cure the disease than to treat the symptoms by repeatedly allocating relief funds, which is a passive remedy, patching up for a while. Therefore, we dare to jointly request and earnestly appeal, and earnestly request your association to consider the plight of the disaster area and provide special consideration, approving the allocation of funds to preside over the construction, so that the dredging and repair will be completed in the future, water conservancy will be greatly developed, and families will be prosperous. The people of the three counties will be grateful for your great kindness without end. Whether or not it is approved, we are submitting a plan and a complete map of the canal, and requesting you to forward them to your general association for review and discretionary allocation of funds for implementation. Attached is a canal dredging plan and a canal dredging plan map, etc. It has been found that the canals in the three counties are indeed the final outlets for draining accumulated water in the three counties, and dredging is indeed urgent. The proposed plan is also based on facts. However, the land price determined by Huaxian and Puyang counties for occupying civilian land, since it is an old canal, seems to have no need to use funds to purchase land again. Moreover, the proposed earthwork wages can also be discussed with local officials and gentry when implementing the project, and one-third or one-half of the civilian workers can be used to assist voluntarily to jointly complete the righteous act. It is still hoped that the conference will consider allocating funds for implementation. The Hebei Provincial Disaster Relief Office and the Henan Provincial Disaster Relief Office respectfully request, sincerely.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Yesterday's Negotiations with Representatives of the Special Zone Telephone Association Ended Without Results <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Western Directors to Temporarily Pilot</p>
<p>Refuse to Pay Fees and Await Removal</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the Special Zone Telephone Issue Committee, in order to request the cancellation of the telephone price increase, sent representatives to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau yesterday afternoon, but without result. The committee is scheduled to convene another board meeting at 2 p.m. today to discuss the final response measures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Negotiate Without Result</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company has announced new charging rules, which are scheduled to take effect on March 1. At a time when commerce is in decline and citizens cannot afford it, repeated appeals have been made to request the cancellation of this measure, but without result. After holding a joint meeting of user groups on the 20th of this month to discuss the final resistance measures, Zhang Yichen, Gu Wensheng, Li Kui, Ke Ganchen (substituting for Sheng Guren), and others were selected as representatives to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau. The representatives went to the Public Works Bureau yesterday afternoon and were received by General Manager Zhong Si and Associate Manager He De Kui. The representatives then proposed: The basic number of calls for commercial telephones should be increased to 333, and the basic number of calls for residential telephones should be increased to 217. If the quota is not met, the basic usage fee should be paid according to the Shanghai Telephone Company's announcement. The toll for calls between the special zone and the city should be cancelled. A meter should be installed next to each telephone. Zhong Si replied: The issue of increasing the basic number of calls, because this measure was proposed by the Chinese directors to organize a committee of experts to study, and Chinese expert Hu Ruixiang participated in the study, it cannot be changed again. Regarding the Chinese Concession toll, because the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Telephone Company have a temporary contract, it cannot be cancelled. Regarding the installation of meters, it will be submitted to the board of directors for discussion and may be accepted. The representatives believed that the replies were not satisfactory to the users, and the meeting ended at 3 p.m. without result.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Directors Exchange Views</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession attaches great importance to the issue of telephone price increases in the special zone. It convened an executive committee last Saturday and decided on four measures, and sent letters to the Chinese directors attending the Public Works Bureau, Yu Qiaqing, Guo Shun, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, etc., to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau's board of directors. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the Chinese directors went to the Public Works Bureau and exchanged views with the Western directors attending the Public Works Bureau. As a result, the Western directors advocated that the new telephone system should be piloted for one year, while the Chinese directors advocated a pilot period of three months, but there was no formal meeting, so no decision was made.</p>
<p>Telephone Users Await Removal</p>
<p>The First Special Zone Citizens' Federation, regarding the issue of telephone price increases, has notified the sub-associations in each district to convene user meetings to discuss the entire plan. The association received reports from the fifth, twelfth, fifteenth, thirty-sixth, and thirtieth district sub-associations yesterday, stating: Regarding the telephone price increase, each district has expressed opposition. User conferences have been convened one after another, and it has been resolved that all users resolutely oppose the Shanghai Telephone Company's disregard for commercial difficulties and insistence on implementing the new charging system. It has now been decided that if the company implements the price increase from March, they will refuse to pay the fees and allow removal. They have already filled out voluntary forms and sent them to the Special Zone Telephone Issue Committee for reference, and notified all users to take uniform steps to achieve effectiveness.</p>
<p>Meeting Today to Discuss Measures</p>
<p>The Special Zone Telephone Issue Committee, in order to report on the negotiations with the Public Works Bureau and the opinions contributed by various parties, is scheduled to hold its fourth executive committee meeting at 2 p.m. today in the standing committee room of the Tianhou Palace Bridge Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and invite advisory committee members to attend and jointly discuss the final response.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Opinions of the Banking Association's Subcommittee on Interest Rate Reduction <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that since the Shanghai Banking Association and the Money Industry Association received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to discuss measures to reduce interest rates and submit them for review and handling, the Banking Association's subcommittee has drafted opinions. Yesterday, it also sought the opinions of the Money Industry Association, and it is said that a joint meeting is still needed to make specific decisions in order to submit them for review and handling. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Glimpse of Opinions: The Banking Association's subcommittee, after holding a meeting to discuss, believes that reducing interest rates has a de facto chain relationship. If it is not thoroughly resolved, it is absolutely impossible to abandon the facts and talk emptily about reducing interest rates. For example, the interest rate on the troop reduction public debt is 6%, but in the past, the market price was always around 80 yuan per 100 yuan, so the interest rate was as high as 7% or more. Now, since the public debt law has changed, the market price is about 60 yuan per 100 yuan, which means that the interest rate has risen to about 10%. This has a chain relationship and must be resolved together. Secondly, since the currency system was improved on November 3 last year, the Central Bank has formed a bank of the banking industry. If the Central Bank does not first reduce interest rates and set interest rates on the signboard, simply holding commercial banks accountable is tantamount to closing the door and forcing them in, blocking the road and making them walk. This has a chain relationship and must be resolved first. Therefore, the subcommittee has submitted these opinions to the executive committee for discussion.</p>
<p>Seeking Opinions: Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, called Qin Runqing, Qin Xiqing, and other leaders of the Money Industry Association yesterday afternoon, informing them that the Banking Association's subcommittee had drafted opinions and requesting the Money Industry Association to also put forward several opinions, so that a joint meeting of the banking and money industries could be convened on a regular basis to explore each other and make specific decisions for submission to the Ministry of Finance for review and handling.</p>
<p>Scheduling a Meeting: The Banking Association's subcommittee has already had all nine members, Pan Jiufen, Zhang Peishen, Ye Fuxiao, Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Jinglu, Zhang Wuyun, Yin Jichang, Zhang Zhuyu, and Luo Qinghua, sign the drafted opinions, which have been submitted to the executive committee for review. It is said that the subcommittee's mission can be said to be completed. Now, waiting for the association's chairman, Chen Guangfu, to set a date for the meeting, the executive committee meeting will be convened in the next few days.</p>

The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations have been ordered to instruct the Transportation Department and the Police Department to comply. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency separately recorded the original order and measures below:</p>

Approved the previous submission, and a copy of the aforementioned measures is enclosed for your information, and it is hoped that you will instruct your subordinate road bureaus to comply as a whole. A copy of the revised measures for punishing and rewarding the seizure of illegally transported silver and silver coins is attached for reference. Regarding the measures for applying for passports for transporting silver coins and silver and the punishment for illegally transporting and carrying them, all roads were instructed to comply on November 30, 24th year, Yezizi No. 4253. Now, in response to the Ministry of Finance's consultation on the measures for punishing and rewarding the seizure of illegally transported silver and silver coins, it concerns a circular, so it should be handled in accordance with the measures. However, railway police officers must not deliberately obstruct and disturb passengers and merchants on the pretext, hindering road operations and causing disputes. Approved the previous consultation, and the original document is being copied and issued, which you should immediately comply with. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Gu Wensheng and Others Propose to the French Municipal Council to Add a Chinese Advisory Board System <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Listing Five Major Reasons</p>
<p>When the French Concession Taxpayers' Association held its second executive committee meeting of this term, Executive Committee members Gu Wensheng and others urgently proposed that the French Concession Municipal Council should urgently add a Chinese Advisory Board system to improve municipal administration. The original text is recorded below: As an urgent proposal, the French Concession Municipal Council should urgently imitate the Public Concession, add a Chinese Advisory Board system to enhance Sino-French friendship, ease emotions, promote commerce, benefit municipal administration, and avoid misunderstandings and disputes. We believe that since the establishment of the Chinese Advisory Board by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession, Chinese and foreign opinions have merged harmoniously. They have cooperated and worked together to improve municipal administration and revitalize commerce, gradually eliminating obstacles. Both Chinese and foreigners have benefited from it, with small costs and significant results. It is a pity that the French Concession Municipal Council has not paid attention to this. Considering the performance, it is particularly inferior. Moreover, the French Concession area is prosperous and densely populated, comparable to the Public Concession. However, since previous years, it has been deeply affected by the recession, declining sharply. Looking at the surrounding areas, the city is desolate, and empty buildings are lined up, greatly reducing the Municipal Council's tax revenue, causing difficulties for both superiors and subordinates. Old stores have closed one after another, and entrepreneurs are even more reluctant to invest. Looking ahead at the commercial situation, it is getting worse. The people are living in poverty, and cases of committing crimes are heard daily. The courts are barely able to cope. Citizens occasionally commit minor oversights and are immediately punished. The ignorant bullies of the Vietnamese police force often abuse their power, using violence to oppress the citizens, seeking bribes, and disregarding commercial difficulties. Negative energy accumulates, leading to repeated disputes, and gradually becoming a breeding ground for sin. Furthermore, the cost of water and electricity in the French Concession is more expensive than in the Public Concession, cutting lines and stopping water, causing numerous disputes. The laws are harsh, leading to frequent detentions and fines, leaving people with almost no way to appeal. Merchants regard it as a daunting task, and complaints are rife, clearly showing the declining trend of the French Concession. There are inherent problems, which can be attributed to the authorities' lack of insight and the shortcomings of the municipal administration, which led to this situation. This is the first reason why it is urgent to add a Chinese Advisory Board system to revitalize the city. In the past, the French Concession Municipal Council often acted rashly in matters such as municipal facilities and tax increases, or was too hasty, building behind closed doors, causing many obstacles, and failing to actively help each other to achieve perfection. Currently, there are many aspects of the French Concession's municipal administration that need to be reformed, all requiring talent and funding, relying on Sino-foreign cooperation to widely solicit advice. This is the second reason why it is urgent to add a Chinese Advisory Board system to improve municipal administration. The lack of communication between the Municipal Council and the citizens has been a long-standing issue, leading to suspicion, misunderstandings, and other problems. This is inevitable. In the past, if citizens had good intentions or reasonable appeals, they were often restricted, like the relationship between Qin and Yue, making it difficult for lower-level opinions to reach the higher levels. It is difficult to expect the promotion of municipal administration to be beneficial. This is the third reason why it is urgent to add a Chinese Advisory Board system to eliminate misunderstandings. If the Municipal Council adds a Chinese Advisory Board, citizens' suggestions and contributions can be accepted by the Chinese Advisory Board and forwarded to the Municipal Council. If the Municipal Council has new policies to implement, it can consult with the Chinese Advisory Board to convey them to the citizens. From then on, mediation will be effective, and the work of coordination will be easily achieved. As a result, everything will be revived, and the effect of direct command will be achieved. It is only hoped that sincerity will prevail, avoiding alienation. Sincere hearts can melt mountain snow, and a handshake can thaw pond ice. With experienced guidance, it is easy to handle complex matters with simplicity and respond appropriately. This is the fourth reason why it is urgent to add a Chinese Advisory Board system for convenient communication. Recently, the authorities of the Public Concession have been quite aware of the times, able to uphold the overall situation. They have implemented measures to enhance the authority of Chinese employees in various institutions, selecting talented and capable individuals. In addition to adding a Chinese Advisory Board to the Municipal Council, the police department has also added a Chinese Deputy Chief Inspector, and there are Chinese district chiefs in various police stations. The relationship is harmonious, which is a great help. This is the general trend, and it is appropriate to adapt to the environment. Otherwise, what can a fish in the abyss hope for? Personnel changes are not immutable. This is the fifth reason why it is urgent to add a Chinese Advisory Board system to follow the trend. Considering the new additions in the Public Concession, there are many aspects. For the welfare of all citizens of our French Concession, it is necessary to add a Chinese Advisory Board system, making only the minimum requirement. For the Municipal Council, there is no risk of overstepping authority or wasting money. The estimated monthly cost is limited, but the benefits are many, greatly benefiting the citizens. This is truly the most important plan at present. Is this appropriate? We respectfully await your decision.</p>

<p>Zhu Xuefan and 24 Others</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Municipal Party Headquarters of this city has received an order from the Central Government regarding the arbitration committee members stipulated in Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the revised Labor-Capital Dispute Handling Law, which is very important for handling labor-capital disputes. All provinces and cities, regardless of whether they have legally designated and reported the arbitration committee members for the 23rd to 24th years to the ministry for record, have now reached the expiration date. They should be re-designated to comply with the legal system, ordering the arbitration committee members for the 25th to 26th years to be quickly designated in accordance with the law. The party headquarters convened its 205th standing committee meeting and resolved to designate Zhu Xuefan, Liu Xinquan, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xiang , Li Mengnan, Fan Yifeng, Liu Jin, Long Peiyun, Chen Xiupu, Fu Dewei, Zhang Kechang, Li Hua, Lu Jinyun, and 24 others as the labor arbitration committee members of this city for the 25th to 26th years.

<p>After some people in Zhejiang Province proposed to assign the Shengsi Islands, which are part of the Yangtze River estuary in Jiangsu Province, to Zhejiang Province, the people of the islands strongly opposed it because the fishing methods of the two provinces were different and the environments were different. Jiangsu gentry Han Guogou, Lu Zao, and others responded enthusiastically, almost triggering a public debt of the people of Jiangsu. Now, Shanghai celebrities from Jiangsu, such as Du Yuesheng, considering that the islands are a barrier for counties such as Chuannan, once they are ceded, it will be harmful to Jiangsu and not beneficial to Zhejiang. They specially cabled the Central Government, requesting to follow public opinion and avoid changes. The original cable is recorded as follows: Sent to Hu, Chairman of the Central Party Department, Wang, Chairman of the Political Committee, Jiang, President of the Executive Yuan, Jiang, Minister of the Interior, and Wu Jun, Minister of Industry, Nanjing: The sea boundary between Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been surveyed and inscribed on a monument since the 29th year of Kangxi and has been followed without exception, without any inconvenience. Now, Zhejiang Province is requesting to assign Shengsi of Jiangsu Province to Zhejiang, ceding the barrier of Chuannan Chongshi Fengjin counties of Jiangsu, which is not beneficial to Zhejiang Province. Moreover, the residents of Shengsi strongly oppose it, and there are many dangers in fishing disputes. It is requested to avoid changes to follow public opinion. We are extremely grateful. Du Yong, Lu Bohong, Zhao Zhengping, Lu Jingshi, Tong Xingbai, Lu Jia , respectfully.</p>

<p>Owes More Than 30,000 National Currency</p>
<p>Securities Firm Sues in Court</p>
<p>Huang Hanliang, who was once appointed Minister of Finance of the National Government after the September 18th Incident, is now the president of the Overseas Chinese Bank on Jiujiang Road. Huang has two younger brothers, one named Molin who also works at the bank, and another named Hanyang, who established Donghua Company at No. 15 Xidonghua Lane, Yuyuan Road, Yidingpan Road. In September of last year, Hanlin began to engage in speculative business, entrusting Changtai Securities Firm, the No. 4 broker on the securities exchange, to buy and sell public bonds and treasury bills in the names of Rongji and Xingji. The account of Rongji was guaranteed by Donghua Company and Huang Hanyang, who issued a guarantee letter stating that they would bear full responsibility. This transaction continued until November 13th of that year. Rongji owed 35,468.72 yuan in national currency, and Ji also owed 3,611.43 yuan. Zhu Dingyi, the manager of Changtai Firm, urged Hanlin and Hanyang to pay, but they both avoided seeing him. The firm recently hired two lawyers, Wu Linkun and Wang Shuxun, to sue in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the first defendant Huang Hanlin be ordered to repay the debts of Rongji and Xingji, totaling 39,080.15 yuan, plus statutory interest of 5% per annum from the date of filing the lawsuit to the date of execution, and to bear the litigation costs. If he is unable to repay the 35,468.72 yuan and interest owed to Rongji, he should be ordered to Huang Hanyang of Donghua Company to bear full guarantee responsibility. Xu Gongdian, the judge of the First Special District Court, summoned both parties to investigate the matter and found it to be true. Yesterday afternoon, he announced the judgment in accordance with all the requests of the plaintiff.</p>

At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court Procuratorate, and forensic doctor Wei Ligong arrived at the station. The police also brought the spleen of the deceased Ma Atao in a glass jar</p>
<p>Inside a Glass Jar</p>
<p>Filled with Medicine. After Zhang examined the body, he immediately took his seat. First, Western Police Chief Parker and Chinese Police Chief Xue Zhiwen from the General Patrol House reported that the deceased Ma Atao was injured in a dispute with several Japanese at the new building on Jiujiang Road at 8:00 a.m. on the 24th and died at Renji Hospital at 3:05 p.m. that afternoon. Then, Deng Shuntao, a witness, testified that he worked with the deceased. At that time, the Japanese ordered another worker, Ma Asan, to take away the mud bucket, but because Ma needed to plaster the flat top, the Japanese beat Ma. The deceased came to persuade him, and the Japanese beat the deceased with a water pipe</p>
<p>Beat the Deceased</p>
<p>Opened his head and then hit his abdomen. Ma Asan testified that the deceased was his uncle and that the Japanese hit him because he was slow to take out the things. He did not know about the subsequent beating of the deceased. The police chief then said that the Japanese Consulate had appointed Doctor Fumin to request a joint autopsy with the court's forensic doctor and the Municipal Council's doctor. Zhang then asked forensic doctor Wei for his opinion. Wei replied that the spleen brought to the case today was taken from the deceased's body, and the spleen had already ruptured, so there was no need</p>
<p>Further Autopsy</p>
<p>Zhang said that there was no need for an autopsy, so he ordered the forensic doctor and the doctor from the Japanese Consulate to inspect the body in the mortuary. Then, the witness Jiang Jicai was summoned to the case. He claimed that he and the deceased worked in two rooms. When he heard the cry for help, he went to see that the deceased had fallen to the ground. Then, the Indian policeman No. 110 came to Yinli and said that he was on duty on the Bund of Jiujiang Road on that day. According to a Chinese report, he rushed to the scene and saw that the deceased had been taken to the ambulance on a canvas stretcher. At that time, a Japanese was standing at the door with blood on his head. He wanted to send him to the hospital, but he refused, so he called the police, who sent detectives to</p>
<p>Take Him to the Police Station</p>
<p>Wu Yaozu, a Chinese detective, testified that after receiving the report, he went with the Western Detective Chief. The deceased had been sent to the hospital. At that time, there were six Japanese present, so he took the six Japanese to the police station. At this time, Renji Hospital also called to say that the deceased was seriously injured. They went to the hospital to question him and took the six Japanese to identify him. The deceased pointed out three of them as the perpetrators. The Japanese detective No. 36 testified that according to the investigation and the confession of the arrested Japanese, the troublemaker was Ueno Ryukichi, but the one pointed out by the deceased was</p>
<p>Miyazono Shigeo</p>
<p>Ishibashi Shigeo. And Kuwahara Tatsumi. Then, the deceased's wife, Mrs. Ma, testified that she lived in Chuansha, her father-in-law was Ma Shan, who was 70 years old, and her aunt was Fan, who was 67 years old. She had two sons and two daughters, and the eldest was currently 14 years old. She now wishes to receive the body, but requests permission to transport the body back to her hometown for burial, because according to custom, if the coffin is sealed, it cannot be transported back to the house. Zhang ruled that according to the regulations, the body could not be transported back without being placed in a coffin. Now, he temporarily approved the coffin lid to be</p>
<p>Temporarily Left Open</p>
<p>And Lang approved the report that the deceased worker Ma Atao was indeed beaten to death, and the body was handed over to his wife, Mrs. Ma, to receive the burial. The Japanese perpetrators Miyazono Shigeo and others were sent to the Japanese Consulate by the police for legal proceedings. The six Japanese Ueno Ryukichi, Miyazono Shigeo, Ishibashi Shigeo, Kuwahara Tatsumi, Yoshimura Seitaro, and Ito Tatsushi caught by the police have been handed over to the Japanese Consulate, and the prosecutor will</p>

<p>Scheduled to Open on July 1st</p>
<p>A Special Domestic Goods Display Area Will Be Set Up Inside the Venue</p>
<p>Shanghai Universal Exposition, actively organized by local Chinese and foreign merchants to alleviate the decline of the local market, has been proceeding separately by the preparatory office of the association. The construction of the venue has already started on Monday last week, and the entire project is scheduled to be completed before June. The association has decided to officially open on July 1st. Local giants of the domestic goods industry believe that when the association opens, visitors from all walks of life at home and abroad will be very enthusiastic, so they have contacted the association authorities to set up a domestic goods display area in the venue, so that all circles will have a considerable understanding of the improvement of the domestic goods industry over the years.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Displayed Inside the Venue</p>
<p>According to news from the local domestic goods industry, the domestic goods industry has been striving to improve the manufacturing of goods over the years. In order to promote sales, it has been decided to use the opening of the Universal Exposition to add a domestic goods display area in the venue, so that Chinese and foreign visitors will have a deep understanding of the improvement of domestic goods manufacturing over the years. The association authorities also expressed their strong approval of this, and the two sides are currently in contact, and the results are very satisfactory. It is also learned that in addition to agreeing to set up a domestic goods display area in the venue, the preparatory office of the association will also allow domestic goods merchants to set up retail outlets in the venue. All matters will be resolved after several contacts.</p>
<p>Entire Project Completed in June</p>
<p>As for the preparation of the Shanghai Universal Exposition, the preparatory authorities of the association said that the venue at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Guangxin Road has already started construction on Monday last week. Five hundred workers are working on the construction every day, and the entire project can be completed before June. After adding the internal layout, it can be officially opened on July 1st. In addition to the various displays of culture, commerce, and art, the internal layout of the association will also set up a zoo in the venue, collecting various birds and animals from all over the world for visitors to see, and creating a six-day long-distance bicycle race and an artificial ice rink. All matters are in preparation.</p>
<p>Promote National Martial Arts and Set Up a Competition Venue</p>
<p>The association is also planning to set up a martial arts competition venue in the venue, inviting Chinese and foreign martial artists to participate in the competition to promote the spirit of martial arts. However, because Chinese martial arts are very different from those of the East and West, French and East Indian martial artists will be invited to compete at that time, because French and East Indian martial arts are the same as Chinese martial arts. At the time of the competition, disputes can be avoided. This move can not only promote national martial arts but also entertain guests. The association has now sent letters to invite martial artists from various countries to come to Shanghai to compete and perform at that time.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Five Years in Prison</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued new subsidiary coins on the 10th of this month, the public has found it convenient and exchanged them enthusiastically, with the supply falling short of demand. Therefore, the mint is working day and night to manufacture them. However, a group of unscrupulous people, ignorant of the law and disregarding the consequences, secretly forged lead-nickel coins in the dark, used them in the market, and disrupted the financial order. On the morning of the 23rd of this month, Yuan Xinzhong, a Chinese detective from the Putuo Road Police Station, arrested a Jiangbei man named Wei Haichen at the intersection of Roberts Road and Xiaoshadu Road, who was found to be carrying 120 counterfeit ten-cent coins made of lead. Then, according to Wei's confession, he and the French police detectives went to No. 6, Lane 455, Kangti Road, and busted a counterfeiting machine, and found 10 counterfeit coins of the aforementioned type, as well as plaster powder, lead blocks, stoves, and other items. The Jiangbei man Zhang Yuxiang, who was making the coins, and Zhang Baoshan were also taken back to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Liu Yugua, a judge, continued the interrogation in the Eighth Criminal Court. First, Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that in order to clarify the truth in this case during the adjournment, he had ordered the defendant Zhang Yuxiang to manufacture the coins according to law in the police station. He purchased some plaster powder, made a model, and poured in the lead blocks that had been seized. However, due to the short time, the plaster powder was not dry, and perhaps there were other things in the lead blocks, so the coins made were blurred. Later, the police remelted the 10 counterfeit coins that had been seized and made several coins, which had clear patterns and were lifelike. Therefore, Zhang Yuxiang was the manufacturer, and Wei Haichen and Zhang Baoshan were the users. He then presented the counterfeit coins to the case. After Liu questioned the three defendants again, he ruled in court that Wei Haichen intended to use counterfeit general subsidiary coins and deliver them to others, and sentenced him to five years of imprisonment. The 120 counterfeit subsidiary coins were confiscated. Zhang Yuxiang and Zhang Baoshan were transferred to the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court for trial due to improper jurisdiction.</p>

<p>According to Shanghai News Agency, the Qingliang Temple in Xinjia Garden, Xinzha Road, was donated by the wife of Sheng Xuanhuai ten years ago and was built with more than 100,000 yuan raised by the abbot Qinghai. There are now more than 300 monks, making it one of the four major monasteries in Shanghai. Unfortunately, the contract at that time was unclear. The Sheng family's descendants entrusted Tonghe Foreign Bank to sue for its recovery. The litigation has been going on for years, which is quite unfavorable to the temple. Fortunately, local celebrities and the temple's dharma protectors, mindful of the meaning of not destroying success, Jiang Kanghu and others specially invited people from all walks of life to Chen Shichang's residence on West Ainxi Road last night to discuss maintaining the temple. Those who were present in person included: From the political circles, Mayor Wu, Yang Xiaotian, Wu Xingya, Gong Zhan. Cai Jingjun. Li Dachao. Su Liping; From the charitable circles, Zhu Ziqiao. Wang Yiting. Wen Lanting. Qu Wenliu. Huang Hanzhi. Zhang Xuxian. Shen Qiquan. Jiang Ganting; Social celebrities Huang Jinrong. Du Yuesheng. Jin Tingsun. Zhang Xiaolin. Yang Shunquan. Ma Xiangsheng. Cai Hongsheng. Zhu Jingfang. Jin Jiulin; Lawyers Yuan Xilian. Li Baosen. Lu Qi. Ge Cheng, etc. all advocated for a speedy reconciliation. First, Mayor Wu proposed to persuade the plaintiff to request the court to postpone the execution and, on the one hand, to discuss with the Sheng family and Tonghe Foreign Bank to extend the deadline or estimate the price for purchase, in the hope that the merits of the incense donated by all believers will not be destroyed once due to litigation. It is believed that the plaintiff will respect public welfare and public opinion and will have a turnaround solution.</p>

<p>Shen Served in the Police Force for Twenty Years</p>
<p>Retired Last Year and Suddenly Became Pessimistic</p>
<p>Shen Zhonglian, a 48-year-old man from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, who lived at No. 5, Bei Yongtai Lane, Kangnao Road, once worked in the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department for 20 years. He accumulated merits and was promoted to the position of deputy detective. In the spring of last year, Shen suddenly resigned and retired to live at home. However, because he had no savings, he soon became panicked. Although he wanted to find another job, he never succeeded. Therefore, Shen often showed pessimism, but those around him thought that Shen's personality was very strong, and that he was only temporarily depressed, so they did not pay attention. Who knew that at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday, Shen took advantage of his family's unpreparedness and privately used a hunting shotgun to commit suicide in his room with live ammunition. At that time, his family suddenly heard a gunshot coming from Shen's bedroom and rushed to investigate. They saw Shen lying stiffly on the ground, with fresh blood overflowing from his chest, flowing all around. A shotgun was left beside him, and the smell of gunpowder filled the room. He was dead. They quickly reported to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate and immediately transported the body to the autopsy station to await a report to the court for verification.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Public Concession's Intelligence Office, its workload has increased daily.  News releases sent to various newspapers in this city, with the exception of those occasionally not published due to insufficient space, have generally been adopted by both Chinese and foreign newspapers. This is because the news from the office is largely prepared in advance, decided upon by the Board of Directors, or deemed suitable for disclosure by the highest authorities before being immediately released. Therefore, the news is extremely timely, and the staff members have served in the news industry for many years. As a result, the writing style of the releases is well-suited to the needs of newspapers, and editors can use them directly. The office issues releases daily in three languages: English, Chinese, and Japanese, with the three heads of each language section responsible for their respective areas. In 1935, the office issued a total of 455 English releases, 490 Chinese releases, and 450 Japanese releases. The Chinese releases were generally published by various newspapers.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular writing and issuing of news releases, the Chinese and Japanese sections of the Intelligence Office translate news and commentary published in newspapers that are related to the Public Concession and its administrative facilities into English. These translations are then sent to the relevant authorities for reference and adoption. The importance of this work has become increasingly evident. On significant municipal issues, such as the telephone problem, the Chinese section head translated no fewer than seventy newspaper editorials and news articles into English last year. Regarding issues like the rickshaw problem, approximately sixty news reports were translated. The total number of translated articles was about 300.</p>

<p>The City Museum previously established a preparatory office within the Arts and Crafts Society for the convenience of preparations. Now, because the collection of exhibits requires a special storage facility, and registration, cataloging, and exhibition design must all be carried out in the museum, it has been decided to close the preparatory office by the end of this month. All staff will move to the new building to work. To facilitate contact with various sectors of the community, a communication office will be established at the YMCA in Baixianqiao. In the future, all letters and exhibits should be sent to Funan Zuolu in the city center district. The museum's telephone number is City 77030.</p>

<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association states that the nationwide general registration of temples has been promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, with rules issued to all provinces for implementation. However, the registration forms are detailed and precise, and filling them out would be extremely difficult for those without knowledge of the form. Previously, during the registration of temples in various provinces between 1928 and 1929, many abbots of temples, unfamiliar with the filling-out procedures, often paid others to fill them out on their behalf. When submitted to the government offices, they were often returned for re-filling due to non-compliance with procedures, with many repeated trips still not resolving the issues. There were also cases where government offices sternly urged compliance, but the forms could not be submitted. The pain felt by the abbots of various temples was indescribable. If proper measures are not planned for this general registration of temples, disputes and difficulties will inevitably ensue. Therefore, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Interior to issue orders to all provinces to allow local Buddhist branches to select suitable personnel to coordinate with the personnel in charge of registration at the handling agencies at any time, and to guide the abbots of various temples in filling out the forms according to the regulations, so as to achieve proper results and avoid obstacles. The Ministry of Interior has now approved and issued orders to all provinces to act accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Yang Runde of Treasure Department Submits to Ministry, Requests Establishment of Central Credit Agency <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Advocates for Securitization of Collateral</p>
<p>To Facilitate Stagnant Situation</p>
<p>Shenshi News reports that Mr. Yang Runde, manager of the securities department of Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, believes that due to poor management and improper operations of industrial and commercial organizations in our country, even though there is abundant idle capital in society, the business sector still cannot expect assistance from capitalists. Therefore, he advocates for the securitization of collateral to alleviate the current stagnant situation. However, to gain the trust of investors, it is necessary to establish a central credit agency so that all parties can clearly understand the actual situation of the business sector, and then dare to invest boldly. Below is the text of his submission to the Ministry of Industry: Regarding the submission of a request to establish a central credit agency to investigate the actual conditions of companies in order to facilitate the circulation of company shares. The reason why industry and commerce in our country are not developed is that the shortage of capital is the main reason, and the stagnation of company securities and the inability of funds to circulate are the problems. Even if there is abundant idle capital in the country, it is still difficult to expect investment concepts to develop. The reason is that the Chinese people lack trust in enterprises. The key to the problem lies in poor management, the lack of a precise system, the adherence to traditional business practices, the lack of transparency in accounting, and the inappropriate distribution of personnel, forming a monopoly. Under this kind of environment, except for a few well-organized commercial organizations, few dare to invest. Take the Shanghai foreign merchant companies as an example. Years ago, funds were accumulated in the city, and the money market was ample. The issuance of corporate bonds by Shanghai Electric Power Company, Shanghai Telephone Company, Public Works Bureau, and Zhonghe Real Estate Company amounted to several million yuan one after another. Subscribers flocked in, and in a blink of an eye, the quota was full. On the other hand, when our country's industry and commerce are in a precarious state, it is difficult to hope that those with surplus capital will lend a helping hand even with painstaking support. The only way out is to apply to the banking industry for loans with factories, bases, and goods as collateral. The interest rates are high and the debts are heavy, and it is difficult for the banking industry to bear the burden. Therefore, domestic insightful people advocate for the securitization of collateral to alleviate the current stagnant situation. For example, real estate collateral is changed to the method of mortgage bonds to unclog the market. In fact, the Shanghai Stock Exchange only auctions national bonds, and brokers occasionally buy and sell company shares, but this is just a decoration on the market. The profits are not as high as those of government bonds, so it is inevitable that brokers will choose one over the other. Recently, the authorities of the exchange decided to promote the trading of shares to support the development of industry. It is planned to start with public utilities first, and then other industries. In advance, the exchange should consult with each company for consent. Letters were sent to each company, totaling 150 copies, asking them to select the best performers among companies with capital, public reserve, assets, liabilities, and business conditions for auction as a trial. Only thirteen or four companies responded. It is the practice of Chinese companies not to disclose internal information to outsiders. Although the establishment of the China Credit Investigation Agency can conduct detailed investigations, it is difficult to obtain accurate information because companies cannot be open and honest. Banking institutions tighten loan disbursements based on this. Therefore, the establishment of a central credit agency is an urgent task. However, at this time of financial difficulties, it may be difficult to set up a special agency. First cooperate with the China Credit Investigation Agency to make up for the shortcomings. Your Ministry is in charge of investigating national industries, and it is easy to unify domestic commercial organizations. Every six months or a year, order them to fill out balance sheets, profit and loss statements, property catalogs, and business status reports, and to check the facts at any time. The stock exchange can ask the credit agency about the actual situation at any time to determine the merits of the shares. Investors also have something to follow, and the future of the industry can develop on the right track. At this time, when the foreign merchant stocks of the Shanghai Public Industry Association are in decline, and the government is unifying government bonds to eliminate speculation, we are given the opportunity to develop domestic industrial securities. I humbly submit my opinion, and I hope that it is appropriate. I should report to your office for review, approval, and compliance, which would be in the public interest.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Sugar Industry Association yesterday regarding the promotion of domestic Yiwu brown sugar.

Regarding sales matters, you can directly contact our association by letter.

<h3 id="e139">Ningbo Industrial Bank Intensifies Resumption of Business, Depositors with Unknown Addresses Can Collect Directly, Moving to Shanxi Road Office on March 5th <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ningbo Industrial Bank's recovery office began issuing 20% ​​of cash to long-term depositors, the procedures have been cumbersome and there are many depositors, so it takes a long time. It is now learned that the savings portion will be completed soon, and the commercial portion has also been issued since the 1st of this month. However, due to the sluggish market situation, it is not easy to raise cash. It has been agreed that whether it is commercial time deposit or special current, those under 5 yuan will be fully taken, those between 5 yuan and 40 yuan will take 20%, and those above 40 yuan will take 20%, 30% of the two-year term deposit certificate, and 50% for stock. This method is also a better way for the preparatory office to seek a solution when it is impossible to prevent depositors from suffering losses. In fact, the organization of the office is half composed of depositors, feeling the pain of their own. Hoping that the bank will have the possibility of development after its resumption of business, until today, the commercial depositors have been able to understand the difficulty of the office and are happy to accept it. The office's method of withdrawing money requires a letter. It is found that a few commercial depositors have sent letters to notify them, either because of relocation or because the address is unknown, which has delayed the date of disbursement. It is now planned to invite commercial depositors with unknown addresses to collect directly without waiting for the announcement, so as to be quick. It is also heard that the preparatory office will renew the lease of the general office address with the landlord in order to save expenses, and is scheduled to move to the second floor of the general office at No. 142 Shanxi Road (Nanjing Road) from March 5th, and will continue to work as usual.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Li-Chiao United Association held a commemoration meeting yesterday for the sixth anniversary of the revocation of the ban on Li-Chiao. Zhang, Chen, Pu Yusheng, and Dai Jinyong were publicly elected as the presidium. Chairman Zhang first reported that Li-Chiao has a public hall, which was first established in Tianjin by Elder Master Yin and is now called the West Elder Public Hall (the site of the Tianjin Li-Chiao United Association). Subsequently, branches were established in various provinces, and there are now more than 9,000 public halls. In addition to encouraging people to quit bad habits, charitable and public welfare undertakings are also carried out. Those who join the religion must abide by the teachings of past masters, learn tolerance, learn to take losses, learn loyalty and honesty, and learn peace as principles. Therefore, Li-Chiao followers are respected, and religious affairs are so developed. In 1925, Yichen and others found that the religion was not unified, being called Li Shan, Li Men, and Li Dao with inconsistent names. It should be corrected to Li-Chiao, and a united association was organized. In 1929, the Jiangsu Provincial Party and Government organs banned Li-Chiao with great force. Representatives from various public halls came to the association to request assistance. Yichen petitioned the central government to revoke the ban. On February 26, 1930, the Ministry of Interior issued a notice, stating in brief that it had received Executive Yuan Order No. 736, which forwarded the Central Party Department's order regarding the ban on Li-Chiao. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department was instructed to revoke the resolution banning Li-Chiao, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government was also instructed to revoke the ban and inform all parties concerned. Thus, such a large storm was calmed. If not for the efforts of this association, Li-Chiao would have been completely destroyed. Subsequently, Pu Yusheng, Liao Shouchong, Dai Jinyong, and others delivered speeches in succession, encouraging the members. The meeting then discussed the matter of the China National Li-Chiao United Association and adjourned.</p>

<p>According to the report of the Head of the Health Department of the Public Works Department, although the mortality rate of residents in the Public Concession increased significantly in January of this year, the cause was not due to infectious diseases. Due to the abolition of the Lunar New Year and the cold weather this month, only over five thousand one hundred people were vaccinated in the concession. However, smallpox still breaks out from time to time. Anyone who has not been properly vaccinated in the past three years should be vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the Lunar New Year, the candies sold in various shops are often dyed in red and green colors. The Health Department tested no less than 600 kinds of these candies, and found that about 6% of them contained toxic lead pigments, which are harmful to consumption. After the Health Department has investigated, warned, and called for inspections of this habit every year, it has gradually decreased, and residents are becoming increasingly aware of the harm to health. Therefore, it has not been heard that anyone has become seriously ill from eating them.</p>
<p>In terms of vital statistics, a total of 104 foreign babies were born, of which 93 lived in the Public Concession, including 48 male babies and 45 female babies. A total of 1,030 Chinese babies were reported to be born, of which 989 lived within the concession, including 529 male babies and 460 female babies. A total of 54 foreign residents died, the greatest cause of death being pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, and heart disease. The mortality rate of Chinese residents was over 15 per thousand, the greatest causes of death being old age, pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchitis, and heart disease.</p>

<p>To the esteemed chief editor of the Shenbao: After reading your newspaper's report on the Datongxing Steamship Company refusing to provide relief to the Tongshun crew members, the content was inaccurate. After investigation, the Tongshun vessel of our company ran aground in Hainan Island on February 8th. The first group of 38 crew members arrived in Shanghai on the 20th, and the second group of 25 arrived on the 24th. The luggage of the first group of people was all brought down with them. Except for the luggage of the compradors and accounting staff, which were stored in the company, the rest was loaded onto a moving company's car and sent to the hotel. When the second batch of crew members disembarked, their luggage was all handed over to the hotel to pick up. In total, there were 25 crew members, and the Ping An Hotel picked up 43 pieces of luggage, excluding the parts they brought with them. I ask, is the luggage of our crew members as reported in your newspaper completely lost? In good conscience, I am afraid it is difficult to answer. Except for the captain, all the crew members have arrived. Our company issued full salaries for February, and the senior crew members, such as the first mate, second mate, third mate, radio operator, first engineer, second engineer, and third engineer, all received their salaries without any problem. In addition, 17 compradors and accounting staff members also received their salaries and went home. However, out of compassion for the small number of lower-level crew members, our company, even in these days of declining shipping industry and difficult to support, still gave each person a subsidy of five yuan. Those who wanted to go home were also helped to find a boat. In terms of conscience, our company feels that it has nothing to be ashamed of to the lower-level crew members. However, these people still run around and publish one-sided accounts in the newspapers. Our company has always admired the chief editor for upholding justice and should publicize the true situation in the newspapers to avoid confusion. The so-called refusal of our company to provide relief to the Tongshun crew members is actually that the crew members not only have no losses, as mentioned above, but also of course there is no relief to speak of. The crew members expect too much, and our company is currently experiencing extremely severe business decline, which is difficult to accept. The matter is as scheduled, and should therefore ask the chief editor to correct it. Respectfully, the Datongxing Steamship Company, February 26th.</p>

Therefore, the sales in these two provinces account for almost half of the national production. The next largest are Guangdong and Fujian, where the uses are also extensive. Other provinces have less demand. The sales channels, both domestic and foreign, are described below.</p>
<p>Foreign Sales — Paraffin wax sales to foreign countries were once not weak. According to the export figures for 1912, the amount reached 214,349 piculs, valued at 2,333,759 taels of Customs Silver. Afterwards, the amount decreased year by year. Although Shanghai export firms occasionally asked oil firms for sample prices, no transactions were made. The table below shows the export amount for the past three years.</p>
<p>Domestic Sales — Domestic sales mainly consist of wax from Heben, Xiaoxi, Pingyou, Jinshi, Chongjing. Sales depend on the work of Taoist rituals. It is found that the Taoist rituals period is from March to May, called the summer Taoist rituals; August to October, called the autumn Taoist rituals; November to December, called the winter Taoist rituals. The summer and winter rituals use the most oil. Therefore, domestic sales are also the strongest at this time. In recent years, the decline of the social economy and the rise of the anti-superstition movement have greatly affected domestic sales. There are currently 110 candle shops in Shanghai, with an annual consumption of over 50,000 piculs.</p>
<p>Soap Sales — Paraffin wax soap factory sales have been greatly affected by the dumping of Shandong beef tallow, Singapore coconut oil, and Japanese hardened oil for many years. Since the price of paraffin wax has fallen, imports have decreased. Taking coconut oil imports as an example, it was 57,574 metric tons in 1933, which decreased to 53,776 metric tons in 1934, and further decreased to 22,415 metric tons in 1935. The decreasing trend of coconut oil has helped the development of paraffin wax sales. It is found that the peak period for paraffin wax soap sales is from February to May. Sales fall during the autumn and winter. In recent years, major soap factories often stockpile goods in winter, so winter sales have also turned around.</p>
<p>The main sales of white wax are also for candles and Taoist rituals, used to cover the candle surface (commonly known as "covering red"). In addition, it is also used to make wax pills, wax paper, etc. Chinese tea exported to the Philippines is also made with white wax. In 1912, exports reached 3,764 piculs. Today, it is getting worse every day. The export amount for the past three years is shown in the table below.</p>
<p>Domestic sales are also declining. Since the import of foreign wax, foreign wax has been used to replace it for covering candle surfaces. The other usage is very small. The annual consumption in Shanghai is 3,500 piculs, with rice core accounting for the majority.</p>
<p>To clarify the sales figures for paraffin wax and white wax, the consumption amounts in various regions are listed below.</p>
<p>The import of foreign wax began in 1905. At that time, there were no foreign wax factories in our country. After the Mobil Oil Company sold it, the Gao Yuxing Candle Shop in Nanshi first tried it, and the effect was very good. In 1919, Asia Texaco took over the distribution, and other import and export firms also followed suit. In April 1934, the Assistance Society transported Russian wax to Shanghai, and the import value increased greatly. Currently, the dealers of foreign wax in Shanghai include Mobil, Asia, Texaco, Tianxiang, Kongshi, Gongli, and the Assistance Society. The sales method is mostly direct orders from users to foreign firms. In the past three years, the import amount was 261,923 metric tons in 1933, 263,499 metric tons in 1934, and 306,633 metric tons in 1935. The annual value is over 8 million national currency.

<h3 id="e156">Record of Xu Chengji's Miserable Defeat in the Philippines <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>After Winning Two Sets, He Lost Two Sets and Retired: Chinese and Foreign Spectators in the Philippines Expressed Dissatisfaction with Xu</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Continues to Win, with Excellent Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Manila Airmail Special Dispatch) Xu Chengji, our country's tennis champion who traveled a long distance, made his debut yesterday at the All-Philippine International Tennis Championship. After winning two sets, he actually retired midway, causing the unknown Filipino player Royales to win the final victory, greatly disappointing the expectations of Chinese and foreign spectators on the scene.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Gives Up the Victory</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the competition. Due to the reputation of Xu Chengji and Wang Wenzheng's decisive battle against the Far Eastern University's expert Pulingdan, a large number of people flocked to the stadium to watch the game, mostly overseas Chinese. Xu's opponent was the unknown Royales W.K., who was not on the list of the top ten tennis players in the Philippines. However, after the match, Xu was greatly out of shape. Although he won the first two sets with 7-5 and 7-5, each set had to go through multiple deuces to win. After the third set started, Xu protested to the umpire about the boundary line when he was leading with a score of 3-2, stopping the game for more than ten minutes. Later, for some unknown reason, Xu voluntarily gave the entire set victory to his opponent. The umpire then ruled that Royales won the third set with a score of 6-3. Afterwards, both sides moved from the first tennis court to the central court to continue the game. Royales then won the fourth set with a score of 6-1. Since both sides had won two sets each, the outcome depended on the fifth set. When Royales took the lead with a score of 1-0, Xu suddenly suffered a cramp and fell to the ground, so he voluntarily retired. Royales luckily won again. As a result, Royales won the final victory with a score of 5-7, 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, and 1-0 (the result of the fifth set before the end of the game).</p>
<p>Great Disappointment for Chinese and Foreign Spectators</p>
<p>It is found that Xu's decision to perform disappointed the spectators. There was much discussion in the audience. Some said that when Xu was leading with a score of 3-2 in the third set, he did not continue to fight, but instead gave up the victory, which was both lacking in fighting spirit and lost the purpose of sports. Others said that even if the umpire and line judge were biased at the time, Xu should have endured and fought, so as not to lose the true color of a sportsman. Still others said that according to the rules, a player who retires midway is considered a failure. Xu's retirement midway in the third set meant that he could not continue the game. Even if he won in the fifth set, he should have been considered a failure according to the rules.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Shows Great Power</p>
<p>Among the various matches yesterday, the most exciting performance and the strongest momentum should be attributed to Wang Wenzheng, our country's tennis expert. Wang's opponent yesterday was Pulingdan, the tennis star of Far Eastern University. This person's tennis skills are extraordinary. In this year's All-Philippine University Tennis League, he once defeated the Philippine tennis king, Dagavia. Wang Wenzheng's match against him yesterday was no different from the first hurdle to enter the semi-finals. Pulingdan also knew that Wang Wenzheng was one of the dangerous figures in this year's competition. Pulingdan first won the first set with a score of 6-3. Wang won the second and third sets in a row. Pulingdan then tried to cheer up and won back the fourth set with a score of 6-4. After the two heroes each won two sets, they made a final decisive battle. Wang Wenzheng took this as the key to victory, and with the cheers of the overseas Chinese to cheer him on, he showed great power in the continued battle, using his accurate left and right shots and net-rushing blocking skills to defeat the enemy with a score of 6-1. The overall result was 3-6, 6-0, 6-1, 4-6, and 6-1. Wang won the semi-final qualification in the cheers of the entire venue. He will play in the semi-finals against the Australian Hash tomorrow (15th). Judging from the two players' results in the past few days, Wang is expected to overwhelm the Australian player.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Gains Great Praise</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng has gained quite a bit of praise in the Philippines. The Overseas Chinese Commercial News commented on Wang, "Wang Wenzheng, our country's tennis champion, came to the Philippines to compete and defeated the Philippine singles champion, Gavia, to win the Manila Municipal Tennis Championship. He was retained by the Philippine Sports Promotion Association and is now participating in the Philippine International Tennis Competition. It can be said that Wang's contribution has made Filipinos recognize the progress of our country's tennis skills. The victory or defeat on the court is a common occurrence for athletes. When we criticize athletes, we should certainly not only value victory. An athlete's attitude and personality are actually more important than victory or defeat, because cultivation must take care of both body and mind. If only power and skill are emphasized, and nothing else is asked, it is true that the true meaning of sports is lost. Wang's good tennis skills are needless to say. His attitude and personality have things that are worthy of our attention. First, he is a calm person. His demeanor is extremely calm. Second, he absolutely does not have the frivolous and arrogant bad habits of ordinary athletes. Every move and every action shows his honest nature. Third, he is good at taking care of himself and has no habits that harm his body and mind. Fourth, no matter who the opponent is, and no matter what the outcome is, he tries his best to play his ball, never letting up for a moment, and never being sloppy for a step. He is not only like this during the competition, but also during ordinary practice. This spirit is the most rare. This is the secret of his success, and it is also the secret of all other successful people." (Manila, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e158">Participation in the World Games Simple Modifications to the National Arts Preliminary <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Weightlifting Not to Exceed Four Performers Modified to Six</p>
<p>It has been decided to participate in the World Games weightlifting competition, and the number of national arts performance athletes are four weightlifters, and six for national arts performances. In order to select truly talented individuals to produce these ten athletes, the selection committee has sent letters from the All-China Sports Federation to the education departments of all provinces and cities, as well as national arts centers, to select and recommend outstanding individuals. The initial quota for recommendation was set at no more than four people. After receiving the notice, each region actively proceeded. However, in each unit, there were special developments in weightlifting and national arts talents. If the limit was only four people, it would be difficult to avoid regrets in the future, so a request was made to expand the recommendation quota. Now, the selection committee has adopted the opinion and modified the recommendation clause in the selection rules. It is now stipulated that the recommendation quota for each unit should not exceed four for weightlifting and six for national arts performances. In addition to being published in various newspapers, the association has also sent letters to various units. The selection is divided into preliminary selection and re-selection. The date is in early May, and the location is in Shanghai. As for the selection method, it has not yet been specifically discussed. Four major weightlifters will be chosen, one from each level. This is because weightlifting is divided into light, light-heavy, medium, and light-heavyweight levels. The person with the highest combined score in the snatch and clean and jerk in each level will be considered qualified. Six national arts performance athletes will be selected. The procedure for this selection is more complicated, but the only standard for selection is the one with the most exquisite and extensive skills. Other qualifications of the athlete, such as physique, attitude, and academic knowledge, are also important conditions for selection. The Sports Association announced yesterday that in the preliminary selection rules for participating in the World Games weightlifting competition and the national arts performance, Article 5, the recommendation item, states that each provincial and municipal unit may apply for an increase in the quota due to special circumstances. Therefore, the selection committee has modified it as follows: The recommendation quota for each provincial and municipal education department or each provincial and municipal national arts center to recommend to Shanghai to participate in the preliminary selection shall not exceed four for weightlifting and six for national arts performances. (Note: The original text stated that the quota for each unit should not exceed West).</p>

<p>The Physical Education Association will hire Western coaches for instruction. Jin Gui and Jin Gui (second) will come together for training and a trip to Germany for observation.</p>
<p>Our country will participate in the World Games in boxing. Previously, due to a lack of talent in this area, it was decided not to send athletes. Later, the 32nd Army boxing team came to Shanghai for an expedition and competed against teams such as the YMCA, with good results. Li Menghua and Wang Yonglan were considered to have great potential. Therefore, Shen Siliang, the executive director of the National Physical Education Association, suggested to the Association that these two be selected to participate in the World Games. The Association approved their participation and notified Li and Wang to take official leave and come to Shanghai for intensive training. The National Physical Education Association will hire Western coaches to provide instruction. When the team returned to Ping, they made a special detour to Bian to meet with Chairman Shang Zhen of Henan Province to seek instructions on everything. After Shang agreed, he also added Jin Gui and Jin Gui (second), who will be sent to Germany at their own expense to observe the World Games. After the army boxing team returned to Ping, Li, Wang, and others prepared their luggage and are scheduled to take the Ping-Shanghai train to Shanghai this morning (the 26th) for training. Their accommodation will be at the National Physical Education Association dormitory. All expenses in Shanghai and Germany will be borne by the National Physical Education Association. Jin Gui and Jin Gui (second), the two boxing athletes from the 32nd Army who are being sent to Germany at their own expense to participate in the World Games, will also join Li, Wang, and others for training, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Shandong Province's 4th National Arts Provincial Examination Scheduled for April 15th <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan, 26th) The 4th National Arts Provincial Examination is scheduled to be held on April 15th, with a budget of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: According to the regulations of the Central National Arts Hall, each provincial National Arts Hall should hold a provincial examination every year. However, in recent years, not many provinces have actually implemented such examinations. Shandong has always had many strong athletes, and the practice of national arts has long been widespread among the people. Since Han Fuqu, the chairman of the provincial government, also took the post of director of the National Arts Hall, he has worked even harder to promote it, with remarkable results. All military units and county militia and public security bureaus, etc., all regard national arts as a necessary subject. National Arts Halls have been widely established in various places, and talented individuals have emerged to take on guidance roles. The provincial National Arts examination is held once a year and has already been held three times. The first and second-class athletes who have been selected have participated in the National Games and the North China Games, achieving outstanding results. Now that winter is over and spring is here, and the ice and snow are gradually melting, preparations should be made to hold the 4th provincial examination to select talent. Han Fuqu personally instructed Bao Laigeng, the deputy director of the National Arts Hall, yesterday to start preparing everything immediately. Furthermore, in order to select top-notch national arts talent, he intends to have male and female athletes who have been ranked in the first class in previous provincial examinations re-register and participate in the examination. Also, in the past, in order to popularize national arts, he issued an order to all counties to establish county National Arts Halls, with the county magistrate concurrently serving as the director. For the position of deputy director, Chairman Han ordered the assignment of specialized personnel skilled in national arts. Therefore, it was decided that the deputy directors of the National Arts Halls in all counties should also be ordered to come to the province to participate in the 4th provincial examination, in order to select talent. The budget for the conference is already on file and should not be a problem. It is also planned to expand the scale of the event compared to previous years. After receiving the instructions, Bao Laigeng immediately began preparing everything. Recently, the Preparatory Committee for the 4th Provincial Examination was established first, and all regulations and the date of the conference will be decided by the Preparatory Committee, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e167">After Professor Liu Kan'yuan's Arrest, the Beiping Student Unrest Has Gradually Eased <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>As many as 109 students have been arrested. Leading figures have secretly left Beiping, and the Student Union is not active.</p>
<p>Tsinghua professors resume teaching, requesting original students to be given three major demerits.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The student unrest at various universities in Beiping has gradually eased because the military and police authorities ordered secret agents to first investigate the reactionary elements in each school, and then dispatched a large number of military and police to search the universities, arresting as many as 109 students. Currently, students who love activities in various schools have safely returned to class. Liu Kan'yuan, a well-known professor in Beiping, was arrested at his private residence on the 24th. Today, reactionary elements secretly left Beiping one after another. After the president admonished the students, the unrest at Tsinghua University also calmed down today (the 25th). The details of the situation in various parties are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reasons for Professor Liu's Arrest</p>
<p>Liu Kan'yuan is a professor at China College, a lecturer at National Normal University, and a lecturer at the Faculty of Law and Commerce of Beiping University. He is a 42-year-old from Xiangyin, Hunan, with a master's degree in political science from the Imperial University of Japan. He has a profound research on the theories of political economy, and his theories are novel. The old-school professors oppose him, and there are many students in various schools who support Liu. Liu's lectures on social science are welcomed by the majority of students, and students also use Liu's radical views and approach him a lot. It is rumored that Liu is a member of the Third Party, but according to those close to Liu, this is not true. Yang Likui, a Standing Committee member of the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Tianjin Colleges and Universities, responded to the third point of the Student Union's three letters of inquiry: "Last December, a professor openly spoke in the Faculty of Arts of the Normal University about the need for a revolution of farmers and workers. The next day, someone told me that a certain professor did this because he was opposed by students for teaching, so he made such radical remarks to win the favor of young people. Seeing that he didn't play the red middle card after someone deducted it, and couldn't win three times, he was so angry that he couldn't sleep for two nights. Can such a person make a revolution? Isn't this propaganda reactionary and deceiving students?" When the Beiping authorities read the newspaper, they realized that there were indeed people in the university professors who incited student unrest. After investigation, Liu was arrested. When Liu was arrested, Liu happened to be at his private residence at No. 11, Nan Banbi Street, Shibalijie. After the military police entered the room, they immediately tied Liu with hemp rope and sent him to the Public Security Bureau. Liu's attitude was calm. After arriving at the Public Security Bureau, he was interrogated several times and is still under investigation for evidence. Liu's wife took clothes and food to the bureau today to visit Liu, but was not allowed to meet him. Only the clothes and food were left and transferred to Liu by the mountain police.</p>
<p>Student Movement Has Stopped</p>
<p>After Professor Liu's arrest, students from Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Peking University, and China College who were involved in student movements secretly left Beiping one after another. The members and staff of the Student Union refused to see guests, and various publications also stopped indefinitely. At this point, the Beiping student movement has once again entered a state of rest. Among the 43 students who were previously arrested at Northeastern University, there were two female students who were very talented. It is said that someone falsely accused them. Students Chuan Xian, Wan Jiadong, Ren Qingyu, and Dong Xigong from Jingye English Night School were arrested again today. Many students from Municipal No. 1 Middle School and No. 1 Girls' Middle School have been arrested. A total of 109 students from various universities have been arrested one after another, and most of them are unknown.</p>
<p>Tsinghua Student Unrest Has Subsided</p>
<p>Tsinghua University students demanded exemption from examinations, and the professors resigned in anger, causing a major unrest. After President Mei Yiqi returned to Beiping the day before yesterday, he urged the professors to have a cordial conversation at Gongziying that night. The professors then dismissed the idea of resigning. As a result, the leaders of the petitioning students, namely Huang Cheng and other eleven members of the Student Union's National Salvation Committee, were each given two major demerits. President Mei Yiqi also convened a meeting of all students at 10:00 AM on the 24th to give a speech. After Mei's admonishment, the students were greatly moved. The details are summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Punishment of Students</p>
<p>The Tsinghua President's Office issued a notice stating: "On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, the Student Union's National Salvation Committee led many students to petition the Faculty Meeting, and then surrounded and coerced them, making a lot of noise and causing the entire faculty to resign. The order of our school has always been good, but these students have engaged in such undisciplined behavior, and it is directed at all teachers, which is a major mistake. The existence of a group depends on whether the members of the group abide by the discipline of the group, otherwise the group will collapse. Our school is one of the leading academic groups in the country, and the country and society have great expectations for our school. The President is responsible for maintaining order and enforcing discipline, and should enforce the law for such major acts of transgression. The members of the Student Union's National Salvation Committee, Huang Cheng, Chen Yuan, Liu Yuheng, Lu Cui, Gong Yuejian, Huang Riyi, Zhou Duoqi, Ye Dulian, Ding Zeliang, Wu Chengming, Liu Rujin, and others, should have been expelled immediately. Considering that these students have already deeply regretted their actions, they are each given two major demerits as a warning. From now on, we hope that you will be mindful of the difficult times and work together to overcome them, so that in these dark times, the teaching work of our school can still have the reality of its continuous effort, so as to extend the lifeline of the country and nation in academia. This is what all colleagues of our school should strive for together." This notice, President's Office.</p>
<p>Make-Up Exam Date</p>
<p>It is announced that the semester examination for the first semester of this academic year could not be held from February 24th according to the newly set school calendar due to the resignation of all professors. In addition to earnestly requesting the professors to return to their posts, the examination for the first semester has now been rescheduled to be held from February 29th to March 6th. Classes will be temporarily suspended from today until February 28th to allow for review of coursework. This notice, President Mei Yiqi. It is announced that the examination for the first semester of this academic year has now been rescheduled to be held on the 29th of this month. The next semester is scheduled to begin on March 9th. All newly ordered courses and special lectures will begin on the same day. This notice, President Mei Yiqi.</p>
<p>President's Speech</p>
<p>President Mei Yiqi's speech briefly stated that the student actions that occurred at the school were incorrect, and as the president, he must point them out to everyone, admonish everyone, and fulfill his due responsibilities. Colleagues and students in the school are all part of Tsinghua. Although they are in different positions, they are united in their love for Tsinghua. Tsinghua is what it is because of the efforts of past teachers and students. We should do our best to protect it and maintain it, but we must never let the indiscretion of current actions cause future harm. In a school, one should recognize the responsibilities of each other. Teachers use their own knowledge and skills to train everyone. Everyone comes to Tsinghua to study in order to obtain this kind of training. If you think that Tsinghua's training does not suit you, you do not have to reluctantly stay at Tsinghua. If you think that the school's training is not needed, you do not have to reluctantly stay either. School discipline is of utmost importance. In school, in order to make education truly meaningful, discipline must be maintained. Recently, students like to use the term "extraordinary times," as if everything can be done in an extraordinary way. However, they do not know that since we are now in extraordinary times, discipline is more important than usual. Everyone should also recognize this clearly. When the Faculty Meeting was held on the 19th, many students petitioned, surrounded and shouted, demanding exemption from examinations. Students should believe in, respect, and obey teachers. Coercion and insults are impolite. The teachers felt the most regret on that day was the destruction of the school's discipline, and they felt that it was impossible to continue teaching. I met with the professors last night, and I have expressed my apologies to everyone for the responsibilities I bear, but in order to maintain the school's discipline in the future, there must be a way to correct the students who were responsible on that day. Regarding the request for exemption from examinations, I can now state frankly to everyone that it is impossible. This matter has been considered repeatedly before. On the one hand, I considered the situation of the students, and on the other hand, I did not want to act hastily in the teaching career, so I postponed it again and again, but it is absolutely impossible not to take the exam. Now that the previously set exam date has been missed, we will have to wait another three to five days to ask the professors to return to their posts, and then we will hold it often. Regarding the issue of education in extraordinary times, I convened a discussion meeting with everyone on the 30th of last month, and I gave a general report on the principles set by the school, the hiring of many professors, the organization of a committee, and the situation of drafting a plan. The plan has now been drafted by the committee, and a detailed plan will be submitted to the Faculty Meeting for discussion before it can be implemented. The so-called education curriculum in extraordinary times only supplements the proper curriculum and does not replace the normal curriculum. In addition to the normal curriculum, I hope that you will study practical knowledge and skills. Recently, there have been many differences in opinion among the students. I hope that everyone can still cooperate, encourage each other, and strive to move towards rationality. At this time, my only responsibility is to seek the stability of the school and the normal progress of education. There are many difficulties at present, and we are now trying to gather all our strength to seek a solution.</p>
<p>Student Congress</p>
<p>President Mei Yiqi's speech ended at 11:00 AM. After Mei Yiqi, Pan Guangdan, and Shen Li left the meeting, Yang Liansheng, chairman of the school's student council, convened a general meeting of all students. The attendance was 810 people, and Yang Liansheng was elected as the chairman of the presidium, with Lu Cui as the presiding officer. A total of four proposals were raised: (1) to hold make-up exams in compliance with school regulations; (2) to implement the school's proposed education plan for extraordinary times; (3) to withdraw from the Student Union; and (4) to reconsider the case of female student Ji Yunxiu. However, all of them were rejected without discussion.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>National crisis is not terrifying; saving the nation has a great path. The whole country, old and young, all wear national cloth.</p>
<p>This is a saying by the Party-state elder Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu believes that wearing domestically produced cotton cloth is a great path to saving the nation. This is a penetrating remark worth remembering by everyone. Not long ago, newspapers reported that the new British emperor went to that market to visit. He bought some domestically produced clothing and personally told the people, "I really like to use the products of our own factories. I hope everyone will consistently use British goods in the future. This is the most glorious thing." Have you seen any Europeans or Japanese who do not wear clothing made from their own country's materials? Sometimes they even proudly say to us, "Why do your countrymen like to wear foreign fabrics? You clearly have excellent silk and satin, but why don't you use them? What is the mentality?" I felt angry and ashamed when I heard this, and I believe that wearing foreign goods is indeed a great disgrace to the Chinese people. In the past, we could say that domestically produced fabrics did not have excellent products yet. Now, thanks to the efforts of many domestic goods factories, all products can be said to be comparable to foreign goods, if not better. Facts speak louder than words. If you go to domestic goods companies and domestic cloth factories to observe, you will know the amazing progress of domestically produced cotton cloth in recent years. This publication is specially publishing a special issue to draw the attention of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Domestically Produced Cotton Cloth Worth Promoting <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Clothing is a representation of a person, so the suitability of a person's clothing is very much representative of their own excellent character. In ancient times, people wore simple cloth garments and plain silk hats. Like Han Wengong's lifelong wearing of cloth garments and Jing Jiang's virtue continuing even after her son became noble, these examples show us how virtuous men and good mothers in our country's past history adopted simple clothing, lived a simple life, and strived for the future of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>However, with the evolution of history and the spread of European and American customs after our country opened up to the world, the so-called modern men and women developed luxurious habits. They not only greatly changed the style of clothing, adopting Western suits and qipao dresses, but also mostly used foreign goods in terms of materials, firmly establishing a psychology of loving imported goods. We only need to look at the shocking amount of import surplus in recent years, the large-scale import of foreign woolens and silk fabrics into China, and on the other hand, the constant cries of distress from our original cotton and silk industries, to know the severity of this disaster, which threatens the economic lifeline of our entire nation, promotes the main cause of poverty among our country's poor people, and the crisis of national ruin and family destruction is about to unfold before us.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to say with conviction that the prerequisite for our adoption of clothing at the current stage must be domestic production. Moreover, under the increasingly acute economic panic and sluggish market, we should pay attention to the simplicity and frugality of clothing, and it is worth promoting the use of domestically produced cotton cloth to make clothing. As far as I know, the cotton fabrics of companies like Sanyou Industrial Society, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Sanxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory are of excellent quality. Whether used to tailor long gowns, qipaos, Western suits, or student uniforms, they are very elegant and beautiful, and durable and wrinkle-resistant. Compared with expensive foreign goods, they are also quite comparable, but in terms of price, they can be much cheaper. At this time when our country's economic future hangs by a thread, how can we continue to act as foreign goods promoters and not fulfill the duty of a citizen for the future of domestic goods!</p>
<p>Let us shout loudly! May everyone work together to promote the domestically produced cotton cloth movement.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Talking About Nantong Coarse Cloth <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Yunxun</p>
<p>Nantong County is as famous as the model province of Shanxi. It is a well-known industrial area. Therefore, of course, talented people come from such a blessed land. This model reputation was created single-handedly by Mr. Zhang Jian, whose education, industry, municipal administration, transportation, and water conservancy all surpassed other counties. There is a cause and then there is an effect. The word "model" was truly worthy of Nantong during its heyday. In fact, its "Nantong coarse cloth" originated very early, not after Mr. Zhang retired to the forest and worked hard to rebuild Nantong. It was originally a famous cotton-producing area in various provinces. "Domestically produced cotton cloth" had the widest sales and the longest history of weaving. "Nantong coarse cloth" seems to have no equal. It is a widespread rural side business. A few thatched cottages, two wooden looms, no fixed working hours, no consumption of workers and employees. Every village woman and every country girl in the county has the skill of spinning and weaving. To what extent is it promoted? Can you eat? Can you defecate? If you can eat and defecate, there is no one who cannot spin and weave. This custom spread from Nantong to Haimen and affected Rugao. Therefore, Tonghai coarse cloth and Rugao blue cloth are called together. In the past, the width of the fabric was narrow, but now it has been widened, making it most suitable for making quilt linings, short shirts, and shorts. It is strong, durable, and easy to wash, unparalleled in its kind. In the northern Jiangsu provinces of Jiangsu Province, it is still the custom to buy some "Tongzhou coarse cloth" and "Rugao blue cloth" when marrying a daughter. In recent years, in order to cater to the trend, patterned fabrics are also woven. Since the loss of the Northeast, a large number of goods exported through the customs have been reduced, but Fujian and Guangdong still have resident water merchants who set up shops to collect them. It is said that the warp yarn is currently made from factory products, and the weft yarn is still spun by hand. The success of a cloth lies in its sturdiness. It is faintly heard that Mr. Jian wore coarse cloth shirts and trousers throughout his life and instructed his son Xiaoruo on his deathbed to make the inner lining of his quilt entirely from coarse cloth, with only the outer garment being the ceremonial dress of the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce. The agricultural and mining bureaus of other provinces often send commissioners to Tong to purchase cotton seeds every year. I stayed in Tong for a short time some years ago and witnessed rural women carrying cloth to the shops for sale early in the morning, waiting by the door before the shops opened. As for Shanghai-Yangtze River steamships, when they arrive in Tongzhou, there are vendors selling Tongzhou coarse cloth on both trips. If this skill penetrates every township and village, how could the rural economy be bankrupt? If the sales organization is perfect, Nantong coarse cloth can take the top spot in domestically produced cotton cloth. Spinning, weaving, and sales should also be spread throughout the provinces. Then, will our "cotton cloth market" allow anyone else to intervene?</p>
<h3 id="e185">My Little Experience in Wearing Domestically Produced Cotton Cloth <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Man Bin</p>
<p>Ten years ago, an exhibition of domestically produced cotton cloth was held at Mr. Shi Liangcai's residence, sponsored by Sanyou Industrial Society. More than a dozen schools attended that day, as well as fifty or sixty ladies and young ladies, all wearing domestically produced clothing. After everyone discussed it, they agreed that the tailoring of clothes should have five conditions: first, domestically produced; second, simple; third, strong; fourth, economical; and fifth, beautiful. At that time, the principals of various schools agreed to these five conditions for selecting clothes for students. One principal did not agree with "beautiful," but because it was not limited to school uniforms, this condition was ultimately added. From then on, I always adhered to this principle when making clothes for myself and my children. Sometimes, when the school authorities bought non-domestic goods or domestic goods in disguise, I would personally go to the school and argue with them. I often said that if schools are unwilling to sincerely use domestic goods when making school uniforms, what is the point of talking about patriotism and saving the nation? Recently, because my children have grown up and I have nothing to do, I often go to various schools to take a look and, by the way, persuade them to choose school uniforms and pay attention to genuine domestically produced cotton cloth. Sometimes, I honestly and bluntly give them many samples, advising them not to be fooled, so as not to disappoint the many families who love to use domestic goods in your schools. At the same time, I visit many families to persuade them to wear domestic fabrics. When I married off my daughter last year, almost all the clothes in her dowry were made of domestic fabrics. Sanyou Society and Hongxin Factory are my old customers, and Mr. Xu Yangnan also served as my consultant. I visit the Chinese National Goods Company, which sells fabrics from Hongxin, Dafeng, Sanxin, and other factories, every week. Recently, I often visit the third-floor market of Sanyou Society, believing it is a responsibility that our women should have. The funniest thing is that my eight-year-old daughter always asks if it is from Mr. Xu or Mr. Wan's factory every time she decides to wear new clothes, because she always hears her older sister telling her that our family's clothes are purchased from Hongxin or Sanyou. Even more amusing, my eleven-year-old daughter always refuses when the school makes school uniforms for her and insists that I personally choose them for her. Children are the most innocent and naive. The idea that they will not buy anything but domestic goods is very strong in their little minds, and they will never be careless. Yesterday, my niece hosted a full moon celebration for her newborn child. When I went to her house, I saw that seventy to eighty percent of the baby clothes on display were products of domestic factories. Everyone praised her patriotism, believing that it is important to cultivate the habit of using domestic goods from a young age. I still remember that the Joint Production and Sales Association initiated the Domestic Goods Wearing Association. Of the 108 women who attended, more than half, or more than 60, wore domestic cotton fabrics, and 40 wore domestic silk and satin. It can be said that foreign fabrics were completely absent that day. Even if someone wore them, they would feel ashamed and uneasy. From this point of view, the future of Chinese domestic goods is very promising.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Domestically Produced Cotton Cloth Worn by Our Women <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ju Ju</p>
<p>My reason for wearing cotton cloth probably dates back to before I got married. At that time, domestic cotton cloth was already very popular. Even though some of us women also used imported foreign cloth, most of our female compatriots were already able to wear domestically produced cotton cloth. For example, the same qipao dress, those made of foreign cloth were only worn by the fashionable wives, grandmothers, and young ladies. Most of the women in our lower and middle classes wore those made of domestically produced cotton cloth. I remember when I was young, when my mother was alive, our brothers and sisters all wore clothes made of domestically produced cotton cloth, and we all liked them. My mother also said, "Clothes made of cotton cloth can be worn for several years because the cloth is durable and the quality is durable, and at the same time, it is cheap. So we love to use it. If you don't mind, you might as well continue to make cotton clothes for your children..." Now, when I think back to these words, they still ring in my ears.</p>
<p>Later, due to the intrusion of foreign cloth, cotton cloth was gradually eliminated. All the families who spun and wove their own cloth gave up because foreign cloth was cheaper. As a result, women all wore clothes made of foreign cloth, but I still followed my mother's teachings. The clothes I wear, the clothes my children wear, and the clothes used by the whole family are all made of cotton cloth produced by Sanyou Industrial Society, Hongxin, Sanxin, and other factories. Therefore, my classmates said, "You are really a practitioner of promoting domestic goods. How many people in our country are willing to wear cotton cloth and use cotton cloth like you?" But in my opinion, cotton cloth is indeed more durable and wear-resistant than foreign cloth!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Impressions of Coarse Cloth and Rural Farmers <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Speaking of coarse cloth, I can't help but think of the old farmer who comes wearing coarse cloth clothes, floating like a legend!</p>
<p>The old farmer has a long beard reaching his chest and still works at sunrise and rests at sunset! Full of energy! From head to toe, he wears nothing but coarse cloth: a black cloth hat, a blue cloth robe, white cloth socks, and his feet are firmly on the ground, working hard! Really working hard! Growing grains of rice like pearls for those who do not know the hardships of farming to enjoy. He often warns his descendants: "When eating a bowl of porridge or a bowl of rice, think of where it came from! When using half a thread, always remember the difficulty of obtaining materials!"</p>
<p>In the past, the countryside was full of the sound of looms. The so-called "men plow and women weave" was submerged by the dumping of imported cotton cloth! The craft of weaving coarse cloth in the countryside was eliminated! And the looms were left empty! "Click, click, and click again, Mulan is weaving at the door. No sound of looms is heard? Only the woman's sigh is heard!" It seems to be a portrait of today's world for thousands of years to come!</p>
<p>Rural farmers, weaving their own coarse cloth, have very narrow widths! During the farming gap, rural women and farmers often piled it on their shoulders and went out to sell it door to door. My mother liked to buy it to make undershirts and cloth socks for me. Nowadays, the cotton cloth of Shanghai National Goods Cloth Factory has better shapes and colors, and of course it is welcomed by the public.</p>
<p>The reporter recalls the simplicity and frugality of rural farmers wearing coarse cloth! If everyone imitated the rural farmers wearing coarse cloth (like the old farmer mentioned above) and wore coarse cloth for life, the country would be saved without the need for saving!</p>
<h3 id="e188">Song to Persuade the Use of Domestic Goods <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Don't beat the drum, don't beat the gong. Listen to me sing a song about domestic goods. China's civilization started the earliest. Creation has always been abundant. Thinking back, Xuanyuan was the Yellow Emperor. Tracing back, there were the Three Sovereigns and Fuxi. Past events can still be known in detail. They first drew the Eight Trigrams and created writing. They tied nets and taught farming and fishing. They also raised sacrifices to fill the kitchen. All kinds of creations started from this. Everyone lived happily and peacefully. In ancient times, clothes were made of silk and hemp. The four seasons were dressed without extravagance. Raising silkworms and processing silk was the work of Lei Zu. Even as the emperor's consort, she also washed silk. Cotton is said to have come from India. China today has coarse cloth. Suitable for spring, summer, and winter. Farming is only for this duty. It has been beneficial for thousands of years. The colors are as beautiful as brocade. Therefore, the cotton is ginned and woven. The women's work is to rub the floss and pull the cotton. Unexpectedly, after the opening of the five ports. Foreigners forced and enticed us. Imported goods filled the market. They seized our money and did not let go. Try flipping through the customs record books. The leakage is endless year after year. A piece of clothing or a pair of shoes may be small. But they are all the people's cream and fat. Therefore, I sincerely advise. Domestic goods are the treasure of the country. At this time of poverty and exhaustion. Awakening everyone should be early. The prosperity of the market relies on farmers and workers. The first is frugality and most elegant. Rejecting foreign goods is not difficult. Just need effort and unity of heart. From then on, all industries can rise again. The country will be rich and the army will be strong. Gentlemen, keep this in mind. It is the ambition of a patriotic man.</p>

Inside the venue, there were many excellent products from famous domestic goods factories on display, such as the China Chemical Industry Society, Wuhe Weaving Factory, China Enamel Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, China First Knitting Factory, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yaguang Manufacturing Company, Huafu Manufacturing Factory, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Dahua Iron Factory, Kangyuan Canned Food Factory, China Underwear Company, Sanyou Industrial Society, ... and hundreds of others. The products included beautiful and novel modern silks and satins and fabrics that never fade, various important industrial supplies, various decorative and eye-catching cosmetics with high quality, educational toys that move on their own when wound up, and various steel furniture suitable for new families. Everything in the venue was new, beautiful, admirable, and welcome. These were the products of the industry that attended that day, the proud children of enriching the country and benefiting the people.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began with a report by the chairman on the purpose of the meeting. After a few consecutive programs, there was entertainment, including a speech by the young Zhang Yinchun, which won applause from many guests. It is said that the child was only eight years old. She was a girl, wearing a bright red silk children's dress, very innocent. Her speech posture was also very experienced, which was really rare. The opera performance by Hualong Elementary School was also very popular. The dozen or so children, both boys and girls, performed comically and absurdly. The guests in front of the stage couldn't close their mouths. There was also a young female child who sang Qingyi, with accurate pronunciation and melodious tone, which added a lot of color to the meeting.</p>
<p>What was especially memorable was the "Women's Domestic Goods Wearing Association" initiated by Ms. Huang Bingpei Pumanbin Lin Kecong and others. The number of ladies who signed up to join the association that day was also countless. Ms. Huang also said: "Now that we have a National Goods Company, it is like giving us a reliable guarantor. In the past, when buying domestic goods, we were often very worried, thinking that they were disguised foreign goods. Now that the National Goods Company has proved that their goods are genuine domestic goods, all sectors of society should go to the National Goods Company to buy domestic goods, and they can get great comfort..." Her words were very correct.</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Pan Yangyao also gave many humorous and very pleasant speeches about persuading people to wear domestic goods. He said: "The best way to use domestic goods is for the wife to sing and the husband to follow. Please let the ladies take the lead, then nothing will be impossible. From the enthusiastic signing of ladies in the Women's Domestic Goods Wearing Association today, we know that the women's circle is not what it used to be. At the same time, we gentlemen must follow their efforts!... "</p>
<p>Later, there were many other good programs, but unfortunately, the space is limited; I will end here!</p>

<p>Spot Market Drys Up, Prices Surge by Two Yuan and Ten Cents; Bulls Outnumber Bears by Forty</p>

<p>The Downward Trend of Bid Yarn Intensifies</p>
<p>Trading Suspended at Osaka Sampin Market, Panic Among the People; Japanese Merchants Sell Off, Market Situation Further Declines</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the downward trend is intensifying, due to the poor market atmosphere and the suspension of trading at the Osaka Sampin cotton yarn market, causing panic among the people. The pressure from Japanese merchants selling off is very heavy, with Chang Feng showing a strong intention to sell, causing the market to decline step by step. The July contract broke below the 200 yuan mark. However, although spot yarn is constrained by futures, the selling price has not been significantly affected.</p>
<p>All Months of Bid Yarn Decline. The opening of the bid yarn market in the morning showed a weakening and sluggish state in all months. Due to the suspension of trading at the Osaka Sampin yarn market, panic among the people, and a consistent downward trend in the overseas cotton industry, the market had no support capacity. As a result, all months fell by 3.5.6.7 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The opening in the afternoon was still good. After the second round, the extra edition of the Da Mei Evening News spread more and more, and the atmosphere was tense. The Osaka Sampin yarn market still had no news of reopening, causing some selling, so the decline was more severe than in the morning market. According to the market, Japanese merchants came to sell off again, with Chang Feng selling over 2,000 bales in each round, and the market price declined further. As a result, all months fell by another 4.5.7.9 jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sales were as follows: Yu Da 550 bales, Zhen Da 350 bales, Rui Da 950 bales, Shen Ji 950 bales, Chang Feng 2,150 bales, Run Kang 500 bales, Geng Feng 350 bales, Ren Feng 450 bales, Sheng Yuan 650 bales, and Tong He 550 bales.

<p>The cotton market is falling sharply, due to the consistent decline in US cotton and Indian cotton, causing panic among the people. At the same time, there are numerous rumors in the market, all of which are favorable to the short side, and the selling pressure is extremely strong. The decline in the afternoon is even more severe.</p>
<p>Bid Cotton Plummets by Six Jiao. The opening of the bid cotton market in the morning was due to the US cotton forward contract for three months breaking through the one-cent mark again. Indian cotton showed mixed ups and downs of 0.25.0.5 rupees. The Osaka Sampin cotton market was unable to open due to the incident in Tokyo, causing panic among the people. However, the attitude of the bull side remained unchanged, so the decline was still supportable. As a result, all months fell by 2 jiao to 2 jiao and a half compared to the previous day's closing price. The opening in the afternoon was still mediocre. After the second round, the market atmosphere deteriorated, sellers crowded, and the market price weakened. Indian cotton on the black market fell by three rupees, making the situation even more difficult to resist. June and July saw new recent lows. As a result, all months fell by another 2.3.4 jiao compared to the morning closing price.

<p>Government Sells Stockpiled Cotton, Discouraging Sentiment</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with fluctuations of 1 to 2 pounds in each month. The news from Liverpool was unfavorable, causing bulls to liquidate. There were some carry-over sales of old cotton, while new cotton saw sales and bullish liquidations in the Far East, causing near-term and distant cotton to decline successively. Afterwards, industry players bought in and short positions covered, leading to a partial recovery. Sentiment was discouraged by the government's sale of stockpiled cotton. The New Cotton Field Bill has been delayed for too long, and even if it passes in the future, it will not compensate for the reduction in cotton fields. There was no progress in Washington. The delivery notice for the March contract was released for ten contracts today. Ultimately, Wall Street sold, and the stock market weakened and declined slightly again. The spot price fell by 5 pounds, and futures fell by 6 to 19 pounds. The British cotton spot price rose by one point, and futures fell by 2-3 points. Indian cotton futures traders sold and bulls liquidated, while Japanese traders bought and short positions covered, with Pingor rising by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, and both Omra and White Lorikeet rising and falling by 0.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 25th).</p>

<p>Xin Feng Yang Hang reported that yesterday (the 25th), the New York stock market saw intense selling pressure in the fifth hour, and prices plummeted. After the decline, the market staggered, and before the close, it rebounded from the low price. The decline in railway stocks and petroleum stocks was slower than that of industrial stocks. Speculators said that this was a natural reaction after the rise, because the market had risen for many days, and its position was inevitably slightly weaker and vulnerable to attack. Speculators engaged in dumping to test the market, and they knew that someone was buying when it fell. It was heard that the situation in customer accounts was extremely good, so there would be no forced liquidation or other situations. However, most speculators plan to temporarily stand aside to wait for the trend to be determined. Commercial news continues to be good. The gross railway income in January was the largest in five years. Foreign funds are reinvesting, and retail sales are making progress. Small exchange stocks are active but falling. On the municipality side, companies fell miserably at the end. The total turnover for the day was 2.39 million shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Flour Trade Quiet</p>
<p>Forward Flour Speculators Liquidate; Little Confidence in New Wheat Market</p>
<p>Flour market opened yesterday morning, with prices for all months showing a declining trend. Overseas wheat quotations: Chicago up 2.0 cents, Canada up 8 to 10 cents. However, market sentiment, with the weather clearing and the climate improving, became somewhat stable. Both near-term and forward speculators were eager to liquidate, causing opening prices to fall by 1 to 2 cents. Subsequently, near-term prices fluctuated, while forward prices gradually weakened. At the afternoon session, trading was quiet, with only around 140,000 bags traded for the half-month. This month, due to the imminent settlement, prices could not rise excessively. Forward buyers were scarce, leading to further declines. Observation suggests that the market will likely exhibit stability in the near term and flatness in the forward term.</p>

<p>Wheat market opened yesterday morning; trading in the current month was halted due to lack of market. Trading in March was very quiet. For June and July new wheat, due to the weather turning sunny, sentiment weakened, and opening prices for all months fell by 3 to 4 cents. The afternoon session saw no trading in March, and trading in June and July was not active, with prices similar to the morning. There is currently little confidence in the new wheat market. However, with good weather, sentiment should soften; rain would cause prices to rise. Therefore, there should not be significant fluctuations in the near future. The current wheat market, due to low inventory, saw very little spot trading, with only 2,400 bags traded, and prices similar to the previous day.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, sources from various guilds were even scarcer, with only over twenty arrivals (totaling over 4,000 shi). However, sales were still poor, with only over a thousand bags being handled by Qingdao and Dalian guilds, making it difficult for the market to show improvement. Thick early rice and thin rice held their original prices. Doyang Jian and Yinbian Yuan were also similar.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, seventeen or eighteen arrivals from various routes along the river. White rice sales in the market continued to move. Due to rising production prices, prices increased by a few more cents. Early rice was stable, with slight transactions in thin rice from the Tianjin guild. Retail sales were normal, and the market trend was stable. White Yuan was stable, while Yin Wu turned slightly tight. Yang Du Jian was firm, with continued retail transactions for port customers, and prices tightened by a few cents. All other goods held firm.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Customer Xian Rice Has Some Sales on This Street <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer xian rice remained scarce. However, sales from customer warehouses were also sluggish. This was because, after the weather warmed up yesterday, sentiment in the inland guilds stabilized, and trading houses also remained watchful. Throughout the day, merchants and customer warehouses completely stopped trading, and the price of customer xian rice, which had been trending upward, was also suppressed. Intake on this street was also quiet, and the market remained stable. Throughout the day, 830 bags of Jiangxi rice, 300 bags of Hansha rice, 370 bags of Taizhou Anqing rice, and 300 bags of Siamese rice were sold from this street.</p>

<p>Spot Soybeans Remain Stable</p>
<p>Before the opening between standard oil, bean, and other markets, some people were optimistic because of talk of a turnaround in Dalian. However, trading firms gradually sold off, and opening prices remained flat. Subsequently, as Dalian telegraphs reported small declines, sentiment and the market turned downward again. Although current oil was reported up by 2-3 cents, standard futures remained sluggish. Furthermore, Northeastern guilds and foreign merchants received news of the Japanese coup, and there were reports of unrest in the Dalian grain market and exchanges, further unsettling market sentiment. In the afternoon, all markets saw continued declines. Standard oil was down 5 cents for the current month, 1.5 cents for March, and 3 cents for distant months. Soybean futures saw no trading in February due to imminent settlement. March was down 7 cents, April down 1 cent, and standard oilcake was also down by approximately 1 cent.</p>
<p>The outflow of spot soybeans from factories continued unabated. 9 carloads of Zhuangzhou and Linhuai Guan soybeans were traded at 4.75 yuan, with little change in price. Currently, standard futures are falling due to the Dalian decline. However, with both the arrival and storage of spot soybeans scarce, and sales of soybean oilcake remaining steady, the soybean market was able to stabilize. Trading of Zha soybeans, Du soybeans, Sha Huang Fu Shan, and purchases on this street continued. High-grade prices were quite tight, while mid- to low-grade prices remained weak. A total of 400 bags of Zha soybeans, over 300 bags of Sha Huang soybeans, and 250 bags of Du soybeans were traded.</p>

<p>Recently, sales of fungus have become active in the Northern guild, with over 400 small packages and dozens of large packages being sold daily. High-grade fungus is priced at 102.5 yuan, and the next grade at 90 yuan, causing opening prices to tighten. Sichuan fungus has traded at 107-108 yuan for dozens of packages.

<p>Due to slow retail sales in garment shops and weather conditions, trading in woolen cloth for Chinese-style clothing has been slow recently. Western-style suit materials are more active, as foreign clothing shops are purchasing them later and demand is still strong. Both new and old patterns of Humu Four are selling well. Replenishment purchases are being made on this street and on Jinghang Second Road. Overcoats, hunting jackets, and bloomers are continuing to be selected by customers and are extremely popular. Many large and small Western-style tailoring shops are stocking them. Ordinary new-style dotted Humu Four are being discounted by about 5 yuan per yard in wholesale. Old-style rough patterns are 5.5 yuan, and fine patterns are 4.75 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e209">A Little Response and Question <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Jianping</p>
<p>—After Reading "Life Bookstore's Reply to 'Critique of Life's National Bibliography' Notice"—</p>
<p>Last week, because I wrote an article criticizing "Life's National Bibliography," it caused Life Bookstore to publish a "Notice" to defend the book's editor. The defense content is divided into five points, and I now respond and raise additional questions as follows:</p>
<p>1. My previous article mentioned "claiming to surpass a certain catalog," because I saw it in the book's preface. Mr. Yu Zhenhuan, the preface writer, said: "This compilation contains about 20,000 kinds. The classification is clear, compared with ××… General Catalog, ××… Catalog, etc., it feels abundant and outstanding, and can be a guide for reading." The preface is like a signboard displayed in the editor's book, but the editor can say "it seems that I cannot be responsible for it," this attitude greatly loses the "style of a national scholar," and Zeng Jianping does not want to argue further.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the Xin Ken version of "Outline of Capital" and the Qingyun version of "Capital" being listed as two versions, since Pingxin-jun diligently blames the typesetters, we naturally cannot complain on behalf of the printing workers.</p>
<p>3. Regarding a small number of books in the bibliography having annotations, Pingxin-jun believes that "the purpose is also to facilitate readers to choose and purchase reading materials, and there is no prejudice at all." These words are not only a misinterpretation but also a lie. Because the editor clearly stated in the book's "Editorial Rules": "For world-famous works, a circle is added before the book title, and for books with problematic content, a ▲ symbol is added before the book title. However, the above classification method inevitably includes the editor's subjective opinions, and errors are difficult to avoid..." Since it says there are "subjective opinions" and "errors are difficult to guarantee," then it seems unnecessary to spend money to publish a "Notice" to argue forcefully that there is no "prejudice."</p>
<p>4. Pingxin-jun believes that "For reference materials (such as rural economic data, etc.), investigation reports (such as geological and mineral investigation reports, etc.), and tool books, no symbols are added in the bibliography." Now, let's put aside this "exception" and ask from within the "rule": Why are most or even all of the books in the Buddhism section and section A of the General Overview of Chinese Economy, etc., not marked with symbols by the editor? If it is because the content of these books cannot be accurately determined for their depth, then it can be said to be the editor's "ignorance." If these books should also be "exceptions," then it is the editor's misinterpretation and sophistry. "Ignorance?" Misinterpretation? What does the editor have to say?</p>
<p>5. Finally, the editor believed that my statement "the purpose of compiling this bibliography is to "promote their own books"..." does not require any debate. In fact, I have a very big reason for saying the above. Because in pages 142-3 of the bibliography, regarding books on Fascism, there are a total of 37 books included. Of these 37 books, only Dong Zhixue's "Fascism," published by Life Bookstore, is marked with a "middle level" symbol indicating who can read it. If it was not supposed to mark fascist books, if it was an "exception," why did "Life" specifically mark the books they published themselves? The purpose of marking is said to be to "facilitate readers' purchase of books," so it seems not too much to say that the editor is "promoting their own books." Why is the editor so petty and arguing forcefully?</p>
<p>The first principle of reviewing books is to seek the clarity of truth with an objective attitude. Even if the review is harsher, it is to promote truth and seek facts, and there is no preconceived notion. Pingxin-jun, in the bibliography he edited, not only did not complete his "study of compilation" with a fair attitude, but also based on his "subjective opinions," listed "International General History," "Markmin's Twelve Lectures," and "Recent Supplementary Education in Various Countries," among other three books, as "problematic" books. I don't know what problems these three books have? Even if the above three books really have "problems," how could there be only these three books in the "General Bibliography"? Some people believe that "the study of compilation does not require annotation, does not require expressing the editor's opinions." However, the editor must express them. Is this attitude "admirable" or "spoiling"? We really don't want to spend the space of the "Publishing World" to do this unnecessary debate. As for Pingxin-jun returning my criticism to "Zeng-jun," then I can only accept it. Anyway, right and wrong have their own comments from onlookers, why should we not show our generosity?</p>
<h3 id="e210">Review of "Life's National Bibliography" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Qingshui</p>
<p>Book statistics are extremely important, but compiling statistics for the entire country's books is not an easy task. Mr. Liu Yimou said it well, "Poor scholars write, wealthy families publish, government documents, social groups compile, there are often printed items that are only given as gifts, not sold in bookstores or listed in newspapers. Those who know the matter seek them out everywhere; those who do not know have no way to purchase them." In such a heavy and difficult task, Mr. Pingxin had a grand vision, "using one person's strength to undertake the complex labor of compilation," and published this thick "National Bibliography." It cannot be said that this is a very pleasing thing. Mr. Yu Zhenhuan [illegible] again and again praised Mr. Xu Pingxin: "I deeply recognize the difficulty and admire his perseverance. From morning to evening, his eyes touch all the book titles, names of people, shops, institutions, prices, etc. His hands record all the book titles, names of people, shops, institutions, prices, etc. How boring is it? Collecting materials is also very difficult... The editor has seen many books handled, which is a hundred times better than those who see the titles but not the books." From this, it seems that this book should be very detailed and complete without any flaws. However, when we flip through it, we cannot help but be disappointed. Not only are the things we don't know difficult to find in the book, but also the things we know well are not found, which is strange. To enable the editor to make supplements in the next edition to achieve perfection, let me talk about one part of folklore studies. Other parts are limited by space and time, so I will not mention them for now.</p>
<p>Speaking of the beginning of Chinese folklore studies, we must respect the "Folksong Research Association" of Peking University, led by Shen Jianshi, Gu Jiegang, Liu Bannong, Chang Hui, Zhou Zuoren, Wei Jiangong, Bai Dizhou, Qian Xuantong, and others. They are all famous scholars who have worked hard and published "Folksong Weekly" (later compiled into a collection), "Guoxue Men Weekly," and printed special books (Mr. Dong Zuobin and Mr. Gu Jiegang both have collections of folksongs). Their achievements are not bad, and no one will forget them. Mr. Pingxin, the editor of this book, knows about folklore studies but does not know about the Folksong Research Association. Not only is the compilation of "Folksong Weekly" not included, but even special books such as "Wu Song" and "Seeing Her" cannot be found. Is this not a strange thing? "Life" does not have these books, they should also flip through the library's bibliography. No, such an unusual "missing one, leaving out ten thousand" is a great stain on this book.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of the books of the Folklore Society of Zhongda University in Guangzhou, my compilation "Daughter of the Sea Dragon King" (3 角), has prefaces by Mr. Zhao Jingshen and Mr. Rong Zhaozu, and is a collection of folk tales from one place—Wengyuan, Guangdong. The editor did not include it. I don't know what the reason is? My opinion is that the editor only looked at the bibliography and did not look at the content, thinking that the name sounded too beautiful and did not look like a story book, so he crossed it out with one stroke. From this point of view, the editor's own words, "Merely dividing according to a book title will cause many jokes," can be given back to him. Conversely, we are a little hesitant to believe his words, "Do not borrow or buy books that have not been read and flip through them."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the efforts and achievements of the China Folklore Society in Hangzhou are also not weak. The heads of similar academic institutions in Germany and Japan have also given considerable praise. The editor knows that they published "Folklore Compilation," but why doesn't he know about the books printed by them and their partners in the Shaoxing Tangpu Folk Publishing Department? (Not counting those printed individually)</p>

<p>(Note) The editor says the publisher of this book is "Ta Kung Pao," which is incorrect. In January of the 24th year, it had been changed to be published by the Commercial Press, priced at 3 角 5 分. The editor also did not know this.</p>
<p>These are not private books, you can buy them, borrow them, and read them. The editor did not even know about them. It is very clear that he did not search widely and has many omissions. Other books published by several well-known partners of folk studies in various places, such as Lin Peiyu's "Chaozhou Folk Tales Collection" (Shantou Kaiming Bookstore), "Li Zichang Loves Painting," Xie Yunsheng's "Fujian Story Collection" (4 volumes, Xiamen China Bookstore), Weng Guoliang and Guosheng brothers' "Zhangzhou Folk Tales Collection," Wang Zhizhang's "Zhangzhou Folksongs," Cao Songye's "Jinhua Riddles," etc., dozens of volumes, were not searched and included. The publications of various local folk education halls have not yet been included. It is a pity. (I also have a story collection "Magician," published by Guangdong Weng Lianxing Bookstore, priced at 1 角 2 分 per volume.)</p>
<p>There are also some errors in book titles or author names; I have already said a lot, so I will not say more.</p>
<p>Overall, the publication of this bibliography in our current China is indeed unique and without any more details. It is also commendable that one person can do this. However, it is not the case that the national bibliography is limited to this number. I hope that Mr. Pingxin will not be satisfied with this and will continue to make improvements and supplements to seek perfection. It is best to inquire and ask the relevant institutions or scholars in each department and branch, and spend more postage and time, then the results obtained will be more satisfactory and reliable. By searching widely and supplementing as much as possible, and striving for perfection without being afraid of trouble, it will surely be more detailed and impressive than before after a year. The beginning of the compilation of a huge work is inevitably prone to errors or shallowness. Zheng Zhenduo's "Outline of Literature" is like this, and Feng Youlan's "Philosophy of Life" is like this. The Commercial Press's "Ciyuan" has been published for so long and still cannot fully satisfy people, let alone this first edition of the "National Bibliography"? However, from having mistakes to having no mistakes, from being crude and simple to being detailed and specialized, the editor should always keep this kind of mentality in mind and strive for it, so that good results can be expected. If not, harboring prejudices and considering others' fair comments as attacks, then it will end as crudely as it began, which is not what I want to say.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Bookstore Miscellany (Continued) <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>However, new literature had not yet established any foundation, and literary works manufactured in a crude manner were already flooding the market. Many were no more than articles from middle school composition notebooks, which, when printed, could also become fine collections of literature. For example, publications at the time, like "Tai Dong," only featured some wild shouts. As for "Zhen Mei Shan" (Truth, Beauty, Goodness), besides the translations of the Zeng father and son, there was nothing truly beautiful or good to be seen. Furthermore, those that were inferior to these need not be mentioned. In this way, so-called new literature was bound to be slowly rejected by people.</p>
<p>At the same time, after the raging tide of the National Revolution, everyone's understanding of the current society needed theoretical explanation, which could not be satisfied by simple literary appeals. Thus, the second trend that followed entered the period of social sciences. The introduction of emerging social sciences naturally had its objective needs, but this trend was ruined by the philistines in the new book industry from the very beginning. They published social science books indiscriminately, translating many famous works into incomprehensible gibberish, causing many young people to be intimidated by the emerging social sciences. For example, the United Bookstore, which is now merged into Modern, soon after its establishment, continued to publish literature books and children’s books. And they touted themselves as a "specialized social science bookstore." It can be imagined that social science books at that time were a source of profit for the philistines in the book industry. However, good times never last. This trend, due to the instigation of political parties and the speculation of philistines, finally disappeared shortly afterward. Many social science books could not be published, and some were not welcomed by readers. This period came to an end.</p>
<p>What followed was another wave of literary books, but it was different from the initial one. At this time, due to the cultivation of theory and the further demands of readers on the content of literary books, the so-called revolutionary literature movement occurred. Generally, new bookstores thought that the sales of literary books were still good after all, and they started a competition for literary books again. As a result, this movement declined again due to various reasons.</p>
<p>This period made the editors of new bookstores very bewildered. Literary books were no good, and social science books were no good either, so what kind of books should they publish? In their bewilderment, they heard that the Children's Bookstore was making money, and the children's books of the Commercial Press and China Bookstore were also selling well, so everyone turned to attack the children and primary school students. However, soon, the two major bookstores, the Commercial Press and the China Bookstore, launched large-scale sales such as the Children's Library and the Primary School Student's Library. The smaller bookstores could only succumb to the iron rule of large capital squeezing out small capital.</p>
<p>Children's books failed, so everyone thought, textbooks are something students have to buy, maybe there's a way. Come on, let's publish textbooks. You need to know that textbooks are fundamentally a mass-produced or monopolized business by large capital. How can small bookstores get involved? Middle school textbooks are all 20% off, primary school textbooks are all 40% off, the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, and Datong Bookstore started the main battle. Those with weaker strength could only be defeated. Other small bookstores, learning from the nearby examples, naturally had to avoid this path.</p>
<p>Up to this point, due to the decline in the general purchasing power in the country, the new book industry has embarked on a stage of collapse. The last glimmer of hope was the simultaneous appearance of ancient books and magazines. Publishing ancient books meant that only libraries and collectors still had some purchasing power. Publishing magazines meant that the public's demand for knowledge was no longer specialized books, but short articles in magazines, and among magazines, especially humorous publications and picture magazines. — Recently, it has even moved from magazines to small newspapers, and new bookstores will slowly be excluded from the cultural circle. (According to my own observation, the development of small newspapers in China today, when education has not been popularized to the public, is only a sign of a further decline in culture, because small newspapers cannot create new readers, and their readers are still only those who read large newspapers and magazines.)</p>
<p>Look, what books have various bookstores published in the past year or two, whether in terms of quality or quantity? Today, the Commercial Press is the most diligent in publishing new books, publishing two or more every day. However, partly due to the objective conditions of China, it is not easy to produce scholars who are deeply researched, so there are also very few books of high value written. Looking at the new books of the Commercial Press every day, there are few new ideas of value and significance, and the general situation can be inferred. Other bookstores have mostly reduced the number of books published, let alone the quality of the books. Some bookstores are still publishing books, but the times seem to be reversing. The standard of publishing books is only regressing. Some, although not yet to the point of competing with philistines for profit by "20% off and 20% off," the publication of boring speculative books has occupied a major position. For example, "XX 100-Day Pass," "Practical XX Method," etc. are quite popular. Sometimes, because it is related to the reputation of their bookstore, they dare not publish it openly, so they fabricate the name of a bookstore. On the surface, there is only a consignment relationship, but in reality, it is all their own stuff. In terms of publishing books, the vigorous vitality of new bookstores is long gone.

<p>The Berlin Das Tor magazine states that since the German [name indistinct] invented the theory of endocrinology in 1849, researchers have sprung up and made new progress every day. However, due to the difficulty in extracting this hormone, the efficacy has not been as expected. Therefore, although hormone preparations are flooding the market recently, their effectiveness is mostly inaccurate. As a result, some people suspect that endocrine therapy has gone bankrupt. In fact, this statement is too hasty. According to a recent report by Dr. Ark, infertility in women after a long marriage is mostly due to abnormal ovarian function. To correct this abnormality, endocrine therapy must be used. After years of painstaking research by the doctor, it was found that ovarian hormones of female animals in their prime period were prepared by new scientific methods and injected into guinea pigs nearing old age and infertility. Three weeks later, the tested guinea pigs became active, and all endocrine glands underwent new changes, as if they were in their prime. Then, male guinea pigs were used to mate with them. Before long, the tested guinea pigs became pregnant. After repeated trials, this endocrine preparation was made into "Supplementary Nü Rong" (Female Complexion Supplement), which was used for neurasthenia, anemia, insomnia, underdevelopment, irregular menstruation, infertility after long marriage, or women approaching menopause. All of them became pregnant quickly and with great success. Therefore, European and American women who were divorced by their husbands due to infertility all rushed to buy this medicine and became pregnant, rekindling their old love. As a result, the drug "Supplementary Nü Rong" became famous all over the world. It is said that the drug "Supplementary Nü Rong" has achieved the most ideal and perfect endocrine therapy.</p>

<p>Most people ignore the common cold, but in fact, this disease is often accompanied by coughing, which greatly stimulates the lungs and weakens the resistance, often leading to the danger of pneumonia, which should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>The treatment must quickly eliminate the cold and quickly stop the cough, while resolving phlegm and protecting the lungs should also be taken into consideration. According to my clinical experience, "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic) combines these benefits. This medicine is made from the lung organs of turtles, fish, apes, deer, etc., hormones, vitamins, and egg yolk, so it also has the effects of revitalizing the weak, promoting food intake, and effectively treating whooping cough, chronic cough, colds, senile phlegm and asthma, and pulmonary tuberculosis with tidal fever and bloody sputum in stages one, two, and three. It has magical effects in the old place. If tuberculosis patients also suffer from insomnia or excessive thinness and women have irregular menstruation, they can also take Pantico Tab (Bronon Tab for women), which is more effective. The medicines do not have any adverse stimuli and can be taken as tonics in all seasons.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Highest Record of Gonorrhea Treatment Results <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Precise Statistics by Dr. Hanville</p>
<p>Reported by the Swiss Medical Journal</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is caused by unclean sexual intercourse between men and women, and if the husband has it, his wife will be infected. Therefore, the virus is rampant. Because gonococci are tenacious and good at fighting, and they reproduce very quickly, there has always been a saying that gonorrhea is fiercer than a tiger. Scholars have competed to study it, and finally, with a persistent spirit of perseverance, they invented an immune antitoxin method. After several times of special chemical operation by the German medical research institution, various rare and exotic ingredients were formulated into the medicine "Ke Lin Nong" (Gonorrhea Conqueror), which can indeed eradicate gonococci in the body, contract inflammation in the affected area, and make the urine clear and clean, and maintain lifelong immunity and antitoxin ability, with no risk of recurrence. According to precise statistics by Dr. Hanville in Moscow, 97 out of 100 people with acute gonorrhea were completely cured after taking three or four bottles of this medicine. After 15 or more urine and blood tests, the root cause was confirmed. Chronic gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, orchitis, etc., and complications, can generally clear stubborn toxins with no more than half a dozen bottles, and 95 out of 100 people have good results. This is a unique and unmatched holy medicine in the world.</p>

<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>Acute stomach disease comes from overeating and drinking. If there is any delay, it will become chronic. Appetite decreases day by day, and weight gradually decreases, leading to malnutrition and anemia, and hundreds of diseases arise.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the onset of the disease or chronic stomach disease, you must take a medicine that is effective and fast but not too strong to eradicate the disease and not damage the stomach's function. According to my clinical experience for many years, it is confirmed that the medicine "Qiang Wei Jing" (Strong Stomach Essence) can be the most balanced and effective. All vomiting, gas bloating after meals, abdominal pain, indigestion, constipation or diarrhea in the elderly and smokers can be relieved immediately with this medicine. Because the medicine contains a large amount of vitamin B, it is also a good medicine for beriberi.</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Pain of Premature Aging in Both Sexes <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhiping</p>
<p>Premature aging in both sexes is mainly characterized by fatigue. Although the person is in his prime, his spirit is decadent, no different from an old man. Wrinkles are all over the forehead, the skin is rough, heart palpitations, weak memory, dizziness, mental depression, and unfinished work. The cause of this disease is endocrine disorders or lack. It is often related to excessive masturbation and sexual activity. Patients often cause anemia, insomnia, and neurasthenia, and it is difficult to develop healthily. Therefore, the physique is always thin and short, like a child. Men have short genitals, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence. Women have dry breasts, irregular menstruation, and difficulties. In recent years, the treatment for this disease has been changing with each passing day, and the German organ therapy has made amazing progress. That is to directly take the reproductive glands, testicles, and sperm of lively and brave animals such as sea dogs, gorillas, and tigers and make them into natural endocrine tonics for both sexes by electricity. "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Tonic) for men and "Bu Nü Rong" (Female Complexion Supplement) for women have a particularly strong effect on coldness in the waist and spine, weakness in the feet, aversion to things, infertility after long marriage, forgetfulness, insomnia, aging, etc. They can transform the poor and weak into strong and healthy. After men take "Bu Ti Kang," spermatorrhea, impotence, and incomplete sexual development can be cured. After women take "Bu Nü Rong," they can regulate menstruation, improve fertility, plump the breasts, and grow hair. It is also best used for both sexes to quit smoking to prevent the recurrence of old diseases and avoid re-smoking, so as to quit addiction early. It can also be taken without illness for one or two months, and it can make the skin beautiful and tender. The medicine is benign, which is its surplus effect.</p>

<p>— Dr. Wen Jingsheng</p>
<p>(1) Painful Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient Yu Fujing, 26 years old, contracted gonorrhea when he was in the army. He was treated in the army but it was ineffective. He retired from the army after three years and came to me for treatment. According to his own description, urination was difficult and unclear, urination was incomplete, and there was a feeling of fullness in the lower abdomen from time to time. There was also a stinging pain during sexual intercourse, and there was no pleasure. This caused insomnia and other symptoms. This was probably urethritis and stenosis in the posterior part. I gave him "Ke Lin Nong" (Gonorrhea Conqueror) from Germany. After taking three bottles, his urination became easy, and his lower abdomen became comfortable. After five bottles, he was completely cured.</p>
<p>(2) Oozing Green Tea-Colored Pus</p>
<p>Patient Wu Yijun, contracted gonorrhea this month. It has only been two weeks. His body is feverish, his urethra is burning, urination is extremely painful, and he suffers from frequent urination. The secretion flowing out is like thick green tea, his glans is swollen, and his foreskin is turned over. I brought him to me for treatment. After washing the affected area first, I made him take the medicine "Ke Lin Nong" internally. Before four bottles, the inflammation disappeared, the swelling receded, the pain stopped, and the urine was clear. After using a serum test, there was no gonorrheal reaction, and it was known that it was completely cured.</p>

<p>— Dai De</p>
<p>Coughing Thick Phlegm, Fever, Body Acid</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Pengnian, 32 years old, businessman, in the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, suddenly had alternating chills and fever, coughing thick phlegm, pain in the bones, and shortness of breath, difficulty moving, loss of appetite, and daily decrease in appetite. Taking medicine was ineffective, and he was more and more tired. His temperature never went down, but it was lighter in the morning and heavier in the evening. When the cough was severe, he could not breathe. After more than a year of procrastination, he came to my clinic for treatment. I diagnosed him with miliary pulmonary tuberculosis. Percussion showed heavy and turbid sounds on the upper chest and back. I immediately told him that his condition was very dangerous and that he should take "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic) urgently. This was originally made from lung hormones. If he did not take this to nourish the lungs and reduce tuberculosis, there was little hope of survival. On the one hand, I told his family to follow the recuperation method, eat small meals, and the bed should be moved to a place with air circulation, but he should be covered with more clothes to prevent catching a cold. Mr. Zhang followed my method and soon his condition decreased day by day. He took about half a dozen "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic) before being completely cured. After an X-ray examination, his lungs were restored to normal.</p>
<p>Hemoptysis, Cough, Purulent Phlegm, Chest Pain</p>
<p>Patient Dui Dexing, 26 years old, from the literary world, was originally thin and weak and worked hard all day long. When he was 22 years old, he suddenly suffered from hemoptysis, slight chest pain, and his body temperature was as high as 38 degrees. He coughed in a single voice intermittently, and the phlegm gradually turned into a spherical shape, residing in elasticity, or with blood streaks. Because Mr. Dui had some medical knowledge, he performed deep breathing every morning and sunbathed. As a result, his body temperature increased and his hemoptysis worsened. However, he still did not realize it and continued to do so as usual. He became thinner and more ill, his cheeks were red, he suffered from insomnia and night sweats, and he was abnormally haggard. He asked me for treatment. I told him to stop deep breathing and avoid direct exposure to sunlight, but the room must still have sufficient air and sunlight, eliminate all worries, and take "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic) as soon as possible. In less than three weeks, the bleeding stopped, the phlegm was reduced, and the coughing, chest pain, and night sweats were eliminated. I also told him to take German Panticome Tob to treat insomnia and weakness. As a result, after only a few bottles, his spirit was refreshed and his weight increased greatly. Today, after more than 10 months, he is healthier than ever.</p>

<p>—X-Ray Treatment for Gonorrhea—</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Huang, had indiscriminate relations that caused him to contract gonorrhea. He cut off relations with prostitutes and focused on medical treatment. Unfortunately, his condition worsened and he developed gonorrheal arthritis, a systemic infection. His whole body's joints were swollen and painful, making it difficult to bend and stretch. His movements were not free, and he had to be helped every time he sat or lay down. He consulted famous doctors at home and abroad and took secret prescriptions and good medicines, but they were rarely effective. Mr. Huang was very anxious and thought that he would never be healthy again. Later, I introduced him to Dr. Yao Junong for treatment. After examining him with various methods, he began radiation X-ray therapy. After about two weeks, the inflammation had been alleviated, and he could move his hands and feet automatically. After another week, the inflammatory synovial membrane and exudate had been absorbed, and the joint swelling and pain had disappeared, and he could move freely. After four weeks of conditioning, he was completely cured. According to reports, X-ray therapy is the latest invention in Germany for treating gonorrhea, and its efficacy is very great. It is said that only Dr. Yao in Shanghai has this new weapon.</p>

<p>Weak Body and Insomnia</p>
<p>Sun Junyu asks: I have been weak since I was a child. During puberty, I was also confused by bad friends, which led to masturbation, which resulted in frequent nocturnal emissions. My development is also not healthy. Therefore, my body is getting weaker and weaker. I have taken various medicines to nourish sperm and blood, but they are ineffective. I am anxious all night and suffer from insomnia. Please tell me what medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>Answer: This is due to sexual neurasthenia and damage to the puberty glands. You can take "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Tonic), a German hormone preparation, and it will be effective after three weeks.</p>
<p>Visiting Prostitutes</p>
<p>Jin Baichuan asks: My friend Mr. Wang, previously visited prostitutes, which caused him to contract gonorrhea. His lower body stings, and urination is not easy. He has been treated by many doctors but it is ineffective. He wants to use internal medicine exclusively. What medicine is best for treating gonorrhea now?</p>
<p>Answer: It is best to ask Dr. Yao Juji for treatment first. If you have not been treated before, you can take "Ke Lin Nong" (Gonorrhea Conqueror), which is often effective.</p>
<p>Coughing and Not Eating</p>
<p>Jing Yongmao asks: I have had lung disease for five or six years. I have taken medicine and had surgery, but they are not effective. Recently, my digestive power has become less and less. Please tell me an effective medicine so that I can get out of this sea of suffering as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Answer: You can take "Bu Fei Na Er" (Lung Tonic) for lung disease. You can take "Qiang Wei Jing" (Strong Stomach Essence) for indigestion.</p>
<p>Never Been Pregnant</p>
<p>Li Shunsheng asks: My wife is 25 years old and has neurasthenia and "menstrual disease." Every time, she is a few days late, the blood color is purplish and light, and she has never been pregnant after marriage. I don't know what medicine she should take?</p>
<p>Answer: This is due to low ovarian function. You can take "Bu Nü Rong" (Female Complexion Supplement), which can regulate menstruation and promote pregnancy, and neurasthenia can also be cured at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinical Report on Gonorrhea <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Clinic at the corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. Hours are 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Unnoticeable Gonorrheal Urethritis</p>
<p>The mucous membrane and eye mucous membrane are the easiest places for gonococci to parasitize and grow. However, the eye mucous membrane is rarely infected, and the urethral membrane is the part that every gonorrhea patient must develop. If this part is not infected first, it will never be severe gonorrhea. However, once ordinary people contract this disease, it first affects the anterior urethra, which is anterior urethritis. If you do not immediately ask an experienced doctor to fundamentally solve it, the gonococci will get an inch and move to the posterior urethra, which is posterior urethritis. Posterior urethritis is more difficult to treat than anterior urethritis. However, many patients often ignore it and still do not deal with it. As a result, urethral stricture, orchitis, cystitis, etc. are all caused by urethritis that is not paid attention to. What is even more terrifying is that, according to my usual experience, many men who have been infertile for a long time are caused by the occurrence of posterior urethritis. This is because various changes and diseases caused by posterior urethritis often damage reproductive function.</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Qin Huoyu who lives on Fujian Road. According to his own description, he started to suffer from gonorrhea due to neglecting treatment. Later, his urethral opening became small, and he could hardly urinate. Recently, his testicles also felt swollen and painful, which is the beginning of orchitis. I used anti-gonorrheal serum and X-ray therapy, and at the same time gave him the internal medicine "Ke Lin Nong" (Gonorrhea Conqueror). He recovered after about three weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Talking About "Birth Control" Again <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanger from the United States, who advocates "birth control," has recently arrived in Shanghai again. This is the second time she has come to China to promote her "birth control" doctrine.</p>
<p>The local press has had two factions, one in favor of and one against Mrs. Sanger's proposition. I was originally not very willing to talk about this issue. It is okay to be in favor, and it is also okay to be against, because being in favor is only theoretical, and I am afraid that it will not have any effect in practice, so in practice, there is no need to oppose it.</p>
<p>Now I will discuss it from a theoretical point of view. According to the most powerful argument against "birth control," it is said that "only the intellectual class in China can accept Mrs. Sanger's proposition. The intellectual class are excellent people. If the parents of intelligent children "control birth," only poor and ignorant farmers and workers will give birth to children. They have no ability to educate them and will eventually become stray children."</p>
<p>I have some objections to this proposition. First, I want to ask whether the children born to excellent people are necessarily excellent people. Whether or not they are excellent probably does not depend on race, but on education. Second, I want to ask whether excellent people are more likely to have the ability to live, or whether they are more likely to have money to cultivate their children. These two questions should be clarified first.</p>
<p>Speaking of the intellectuals of today, they are also very pitiful. Some starve to death, some commit suicide, some hold young children at home, some become thieves and robbers, some become traitors and treacherous merchants. Didn't a college student who had studied abroad rob a sea liner a few years ago? Didn't three college students in Zhejiang be shot a few years ago just because they became kidnappers? Are they intellectuals? Now, Yin Rugeng in North China and the many protagonists in the puppet shows outside the pass probably cannot be regarded as excellent people and intellectuals, right?</p>
<p>Let me turn around and ask, if excellent people are bound to give birth to excellent people, then the big pavilions will inevitably give birth to small Hengers, the big powerful people will inevitably give birth to small powerful people, and the big wealthy merchants will inevitably give birth to small wealthy merchants. But let me ask, of the so-called big bosses, the so-called powerful people, the so-called celebrities, and people who have productive capacity in society, and all people who can do things that benefit the masses in society, are their parents mostly excellent people? Although I cannot investigate them one by one, I am afraid that there are many whose parents are not excellent people but can strive out of difficulties and hardships, right?</p>
<p>In short, if the country is safe, the society is good, and it can develop rich resources and have productive industries, then adding one person will benefit one person. If the country is weak and various industries go bankrupt, adding one person will add one unemployed vagrant, one bandit, one traitor, and one criminal. Should we "control birth" or "not control birth"? Let me ask, what is the situation now?</p>

<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>Coming out of the bathhouse, I walked down the street with my head lowered. Suddenly, a hand patted my shoulder. Before I could even see his face, a white book was thrust into my chest. Without even waiting for me to examine the cover of the small book, he spoke:</p>
<p>"Have you been baptized?"</p>
<p>Looking down at the booklet in my hand, on which the words "Gospel" were neatly printed, I said:</p>
<p>"I have not been baptized."</p>
<p>"Then you should be baptized immediately." His gaze was certain, but his tone was almost commanding. "Where do you live? Is there a church there?"</p>
<p>"I live in Jing'an Temple."</p>
<p>"That's good. There's a church in Jing'an Temple. You should go every day." He opened the floodgates of his words, a string of phrases he had recited hundreds of times, gushing forth. "Do you know? Jesus is the Son of God. Everyone who believes in Jesus will be given eternal life by God and will ascend to heaven." Immediately, a look of intimidation and temptation appeared in his eyes: "You are a sinner. Not just you, everyone in the world is a sinner. You must know: those who do not believe in Jesus will go to hell." He pronounced the words "hell" with particular emphasis. "Do you understand what hell is? Ugh! Hell is where the Shanghainese 'devils' live!"</p>
<p>"Can believing in Jesus get me food to eat?" His sermon-like tone made me impatient.</p>
<p>"That's great. I'll go get baptized with you, but you have to treat me to a meal first." I made as if to leave with him.</p>
<p>"Hey! Don't just think about eating! Believe in God first, and of course you'll have food to eat. --- Look at me," he smoothed his hand over his chest, as if to straighten his clothes. "I came to Shanghai from my hometown without a single relative or a single copper, and I've survived for six or seven years. Ugh! As long as you believe in God, what's there to fear about having nothing to eat or wear?"</p>
<p>"When a person is very hungry, is there anything more important than eating?" I said indignantly.</p>
<p>"I'm telling you not to always think about eating..."</p>
<p>"What if I starve to death?" I interrupted.</p>
<p>"If you die, how can you believe in God?"</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, people who believe in God won't starve to death. Even if they die, they can go to heaven!" But immediately he corrected himself: "No, people who believe in God won't die, they will have eternal life! Not just us humans, God will protect even birds and insects. God is merciful!"</p>
<p>"Then why couldn't the birds in Tsuruga find food and thousands of them killed each other? Didn't they believe in God either?"</p>
<p>"That, that..." "That's impossible." His face turned red. "That, that God can't control so many things..." He was finally forced to confess by me, the inquisitor.</p>
<p>He was embarrassed and restless. Amidst the laughter of the onlookers, his sacred mask was shattered by me.</p>

<p>— Huang Xu</p>
<p>She paced back and forth outside the madam's bedroom. She wrung her hands anxiously. One moment she would raise her hand to push open the door, the next she would shrink back in fear. She had repeated this hesitant action more than a dozen times.</p>
<p>Finally, she mustered her courage and pushed open the door, tiptoeing inside. Hearing the door open, the madam, who was playing mahjong, glanced at her. Pierced by that arrow-sharp gaze, the wide mouth with its two thick, clumsy lips immediately fell silent.</p>
<p>"Madam, Madam..." she stuttered, repeating the words twice, her face flushed and her thick lips trembling slightly.</p>
<p>"What is it?" the madam asked casually, with a touch of harshness, because her Clean Three Sides had just been won by the player on her left, and she was angry.</p>
<p>"Madam, I want, I want..." As usual, she repeated the words, just as she was about to slowly pour out the words she had prepared, when the madam suddenly turned half her face and snapped:</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>Startled, she forgot all the words she had prepared, and could only come straight to the point:</p>
<p>"I want... I want to borrow some money from you, Madam!..."</p>
<p>"Borrow money?" This time, the madam seemed surprised, and the other three female mahjong players also looked up. The madam turned her head and looked at the woman with disgust, saying, "What do you need the money for?"</p>
<p>"My man... is sick... very... sick... No money to hire... a doctor... buy medicine... I'm afraid... I'm afraid... for his life..." She said in a trembling voice, each word seeming to roll around, so it wasn't very clear. By the time she got to the last sentence, she dared not look up, and tears streamed down her face. She then used the corner of her clothes to wipe them away.</p>
<p>The madam hated and dreaded nothing more than someone borrowing money when she was gambling! Especially when the madam was having a bad hand, and especially when someone started crying in front of her near the end of the year! It was bad luck! At first, the madam had felt a little sorry for her, but later it turned to hatred, even animosity.</p>
<p>"Hmph, borrow money! You don't even know the rules. You're crying in front of me, bringing me bad luck!..." The more the madam thought about it, the angrier she became. She temporarily stopped playing mahjong, stood up, walked up to the woman, and said loudly:</p>
<p>"Get out of here! We don't need you here!"</p>
<p>It was like a bolt from the blue. The woman was stunned. With a thud, she instinctively knelt down.</p>
<p>"Madam, Madam, save me, save me!..." My man... my mother-in-law... my children all depend on me!..." Madam, Madam, I... I can't leave here!..."</p>
<p>She knelt on the floor, weeping and pleading, like a lamb in the hands of a wolf.</p>
<p>But it was no use! The madam still wore a fierce expression, showing no pity. Her proud self-esteem was threatening her! She felt that the more this woman did this, the more she insulted her dignity, and the more she made the three female mahjong players laugh at her! Infuriated, she raised her feet, wearing high-heeled leather shoes, and kicked the poor woman at random, shouting:</p>
<p>"Get out of here! Get out of here! We don't need you here!"</p>
<p>"Sister Li, don't get angry with this kind of person. Let's play mahjong!" The three female guests ran over, dragging and coaxing her to sit down.</p>
<p>The woman also stopped crying, got up, looked at the madam despairingly, and finally lifted her heavy steps, slowly, slowly walking out.</p>
<p>Now, the crisp sound of bamboo tiles rang out again in the madam's room.</p>

<p>— Yihua</p>
<p>In Tra Vinh</p>
<p>It was late autumn when I finally settled down in Tra Vinh.</p>
<p>For a wanderer, a prisoner of life, finding a job is an indescribably joyful experience. Even now, recalling the elation I felt when a Chinese merchant in Tra Vinh hired me as a tutor, I still feel a slight sense of comfort.</p>
<p>Tra Vinh is one of the six provinces of Annam, but in reality, it's just a larger market town in the countryside. If you look down from above, Tra Vinh must look like an isolated island surrounded by an ocean of emerald leaves. Living in such a market town, devoid of the clamor of city life, certainly has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Our shop was by the river. In the morning, after telling the three children some stories, I would open the "Thousand Character Classic" to explain it to them and teach them to recite it. When we recited "Autumn ends, but the grass in Jiangnan does not wither," the children, growing up in a foreign land, naturally felt nothing, but I couldn't help but look out the window: outside, on the other side of the river, was a boundless ocean of green, and with the gusts of wind, the long wild grass stirred up gentle waves. Autumn was coming to an end, and the green grass in Jiangnan at that time might have been slightly yellow, but here it was still green, as green as early spring.</p>
<p>After lunch, everyone in the shop became drowsy. I moved a chair, sat down facing the river in the shade of the eaves, and stared blankly, as if lost, at the tall coconut groves, the blue sky, and the white clouds on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>"You are in a foreign land!" Looking at this scenery full of exotic charm, I whispered to myself. On the opposite bank, there were often Annamese people with dark complexions, bare chests, and red cloths wrapped around their waists, walking back and forth. They swayed as they walked, and the long, slightly curved sickles in their hands flashed. Seeing this scene often made me unconsciously imagine scenes from ancient times.</p>
<p>In Tra Vinh, nothing made me love it more than the stars. At night, the gentle breeze brought waves of unknown fragrance of grass. At that time, the stars in the deep blue sky were twinkling and whispering. They were so small, so dazzling, so small and dazzling like the tip of a needle, that people could not get used to them. Under the cover of the sky, I sat blankly in a trance. If you are a wandering person, you will know that in such scenery, what comes to my mind must be the thought of relatives and friends, and the longing for my hometown.</p>

<p>— Qiuyuan</p>
<p>"That's not easy; because although there are three pictures placed in front of you, they represent two different personalities, different emotions, different personalities; each one is good, I know that you will choose these three from these many photos. You see, don't they represent three different personalities? Doesn't this one have that unique and beautiful southern European, Spanish sentiment; doesn't this one represent a modern, quick-witted female student; doesn't this one reveal a wise and mature, modern young woman? Each of the three is different, each has its own advantages, so which one should I choose for you?"</p>
<p>"That's right, everything you said is right, but you know which one I want."</p>
<p>"Then let me guess... isn't it this one?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I knew you would know what I wanted."</p>
<p>"Tell me, why this one?"</p>
<p>"That's hard, I just like this one, it's hard to say why, on the contrary, you know. Qiuhua placed her left hand on Zhuo Min's left hand, facing him, looking at him with her eyes."</p>
<p>"Tell me, tell me."</p>
<p>"If you insist, then I can only tell you. You know, only this one can better represent your personality. The other two are good, of course; but what they can show of you is not as much as this one. You see, here, you have calmness, intelligence, and you are so chic, wearing that man's jacket, even more shows your demeanor, more shows your maturity, more shows your secret feelings. I like this one, because what I like is all here."</p>

<p>— (Fool)</p>
<p>The newly appointed ambassador to Japan, Mr. Xu Shiying, has received his credentials and will go to Japan to take office soon. Tan Laosan said: The task of the chairman of the Accounting Committee is only the lives of tens of thousands of famine victims in China, entrusted to Mr. Xu. Now that he has become the newly appointed ambassador to Japan, he is entrusting the lives of all Chinese people to Mr. Xu's shoulders. I hope Mr. Xu will work hard for the country!</p>
<p>Madame Taipui Xu, a political reporter for the French Fadel newspaper, wrote an article speculating that a world war will break out in Europe in the summer of 1937. Tan Laosan said that the Second World War is imminent and is predictable by everyone. However, most people say that the start of the war will not be in Europe but in the Far East. This is also a matter of opinion. Let's see how the facts develop and then prove which of the two is correct. As for the great war only starting next summer, I am afraid we can't wait that long.</p>

<p>A revolutionary soldier's concubine is better than a warlord's concubine. Once you get one, don't be silly. A concubine is still a concubine, the master is still the master, and China is still China!</p>
<p>"Business is still business!"</p>
<p>"That's right, business is always business..."</p>
<p>The above are a few lines of dialogue casually copied from "Business". Look, how meaningful they are. In fact, this is still discussing the jokes in their "Business". Although it is said to be a joke, it still feels very pertinent in these years, and many stories like this have happened. The only difference is that "China is still not China."</p>
<p>It just so happens that the so-called "business" in the play is now in vogue!</p>
<p>Isn't the international situation getting more tense every day? How are those arms dealers competing in private, this gives them an opportunity to make a fortune!</p>
<p>That's right, "Business" is just telling you this.</p>
<p>The compradore of a foreign company, Mei Xiyu, who is engaged in the arms "business", in order to sell a large batch of arms and make a fortune, is planning with his fellow compradore Tao Jinmi in a hotel on how to give his younger sister Mei Keqing as a gift to a chief of staff named Song, hoping for the success of their arms "business". They try every possible means to deceive their sister into the hotel and force her to prostitute herself. But the difficulty is that she knows the ways of the world too well and is not moved by the temptation of profit. But how can they let go? Finally, they set a trap to recruit her lover Pan Xuegui and imprison him as a condition to coerce her. Keqing wants to save her lover and finally realizes her previous "cough, revolutionary women still have to sell themselves"! This sentence was "sold" by her own brother in partnership!</p>
<p>But they made the arrangements very carefully and the plan was very meticulous, making people feel that there were no flaws at all. This cannot but admire the ingenuity of this group of people's tricks!</p>
<p>We have heard from friends who have seen "Business" performed on stage that Mei Keqing followed Chief of Staff Song because she admired vanity. We dare not agree with this view. Let you listen on! Think about the root of "women still have to be sold".</p>
<p>This is considered an introduction to "Business".</p>

<p>Opening "Fisherwoman's Morning Makeup"</p>
<p>The water in the pond is rising, and the fishing boats are moored. Willows hang down, covering ten thousand strands. At dawn, I only hear the orioles calling my dream. Quietly, the fisherwoman is busy throwing off the quilt lightly. She is, her body is thin and she lifts up. She is, her sleepy eyes are blurred and she is afraid to look closely. She is, she stretches lazily, yawning with her lotus arms. She is, she tidies up her clothes and bends her waist. But I see her, drawing water with a copper basin to wash her lotus face. But I see her, propping up the thatched window and supporting the bamboo pole. But I see her, picking up her clothes and adding half an arm. But I see her, lightly opening the mirror case and drawing her eyebrows. I also see her, tidying up a strand of spring cloud and combing it. Her hair is tied in the style of a nimble snake, charming. The powder box opens back, reflecting a startled wild goose. Furthermore, she carefully draws her eyebrows with willow charcoal. I can't describe her, her graceful appearance is charming. It will make people's souls melt at first sight. After finishing her makeup, the fisherwoman puts away her makeup tools. She calls out from the bow of the boat with a net in hand. Suddenly, I hear a light paddling of an oar.</p>

<p>Don't laugh at my crazy and dirty appearance. The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha intentionally descended to the mortal world. Borrow my body to sit in meditation at Lingyin Temple. I wrote poems on the wall to sweep away Qin. The Prime Minister of the Dynasty came to offer incense. Three sticks of incense are held in hand. Bow your head and silently communicate with the gods. I only hope for favorable weather. I only ask that the couple can live a long life. Bless the virtuous father and son of the Yue family. Go to the Immortal Realm early and be reborn. Raising his head, he suddenly saw the poem. The traitor trembled with fear. This poem was written by Lady Xing. The incident happened when a fire burned the Spring Window. He immediately asked the mad monk in anger. He didn't know that he could utter Zen secrets and was full of changes. He could summon wind and rain and do everything. He held a fire tube to communicate with foreign countries. He also took a broom to sweep away traitors. The storm was only caused by exclusive power. He died unjustly at the Cold Spring Pavilion. The couple discussed it together when they returned home. They shaved their heads and converted to Buddhism to renounce fame and fortune. They listened to the rumors of long-tongued women. They suffered all kinds of suffering. To this day, he is completely guarding the Yue Wang Tomb.</p>

<p>— Ye Ke</p>
<p>Li Pingqian's "Peach and Plum Competition", directed by Xiao Jiaozi, was originally renamed from "Love Letter". The title of this play is enough to make people intoxicated, and its content not only has a tortuous story, but also has more love principles that every young man and woman can understand. Here, let me introduce some fragments of the love forum:</p>
<p>You Guangzhao's Secret to Love On the day that Yuan Lanjun (Moli) and Wang Zhengxin (Tiefu) got married, the best men were You Guangzhao, Wang Jiting, Sun Zheng, and Li Qing. On this day, in a corner of the reception room, You Dapangzi and a few others were holding a love forum. They talked about Lanjun and Zhengxin's marriage, and also talked about why the rigid Wang Zhengxin would marry Yuan Lanjun, a woman with such flexibility. Then, in their conversation, we can know that the fat You Guangzhao is the one who knows the secret to love best:</p>
<p>Sun: I really didn't expect that Tiefu (Wang Zhengxin) would marry this young lady (Yuan Lanjun), and they suddenly got engaged!</p>
<p>You: There's nothing surprising about that. The man has this (pointing to his head), has this (pointing to his strong body), and the woman has this (pointing to her face) and has this (gesturing for money)!</p>
<p>Sun: But wasn't he madly in love with Miss (Ye Qiuxin) before? How did it change again?</p>
<p>You: Because Miss has this (pointing to her face) but doesn't have this (gesturing for money)!</p>
<p>Wang Jiting's Love Experience, when they talked about this, Wang Jiting, the devil who specializes in playing with women, also joined in the discussion. His words may be very suitable for the expression of love among ordinary young people today:</p>
<p>Wang: It's not me being a pervert, but if it were me, I would want the second young lady, not the big young lady. Love is inherently stimulating. A woman who understands love is the one who can stimulate a man. Look at this second young lady, that kind of courage, that kind of means.</p>
<p>Sun: Talking about means is not true love!</p>
<p>Wang: What do you know? You have to have the means to express it!</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The colleagues of the publicity department of Mingxing Company all resigned.</p>
<p>According to the editor of "Twentieth Century" and the editor of "Sixth World" Mu Xiaoying, 4,000 copies of the first edition of the first issue of "Six Arts" were sold out.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: I just want to take a look at the Ran version of the first issue of Six Arts.)</p>
<p>Writing movie news and getting "allowances" is a shocking invention of Neishi. Li Er, Li San, Li Si, have you received it?</p>
<p>(Confucius said: Li Wu and Li Liu are not included.)</p>
<p>It is said that the marriage contract between Hu Xinling and Ye Qiuxia is now in "trial marriage". The term of the trial marriage is three years. Within these three years, if they are compatible, they will stay together (hold a formal wedding), if they are not compatible, they will leave. (Each goes his own way.)</p>
<p>"Parents and Children" seems to have a lot of "business sense" (there are many singing and dancing scenes inside, which is enough to prove it). However, too much "business sense" will also become secondary, making the theme dim and dull. It can be seen that "business sense" is something that can be had but cannot be had.</p>
<p>The biggest victory of "Parents and Children" is that it made people discover that child actor Hu Rongrong is very good at acting and very cute. Therefore, the second play of the culture will star Hu Rongrong.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: I heard people say that the name of the film seems to be "Little Doctor".)</p>
<p>It is rumored that Bao Kehua and Tang Huaiqiu's daughter Xiangqing have become "a perfect couple", according to Bao Kehua's words, it is a "rumor".</p>
<p>(Confucius said: Are you clearing the rumors for "Brother Ke"?)</p>
<h3 id="e234">Tidbits from Lianhua <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The very Eastern silver-screen-esque "Tianlun" (Family) will soon be performed in Europe, and this film has already garnered great attention from overseas Chinese in Europe and people of that land.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan has made great progress in Mandarin. Recently, a test screening of her dialogue portion in "Cimu Qu" (Song of a慈母 Loving Mother) revealed not only clear pronunciation but also excellent emotional expression in her language.</p>
<p>The shooting of Ma Long's (Jin Yan) bedroom in "Dao Ziran Qu" (To Nature) required a large number of items such as cow horns, clam shells, and large pumpkins. The production staff spent several days procuring these props before they could finally be prepared. Director Sun Yu said, "This film uses a lot of unusual props. In addition to those that need to be purchased at great expense, there are also many that need to be borrowed from the outside world. In short, the plot of this film is a bit special, so the things used are also a bit special."</p>
<p>Jin Yan's dog has already started appearing in shots in "Lang Tao Sha" (Sand of Waves). The dog has received long-term training and is very easy to work with in acting, helping the director. Zhang Zhizhi praised this dog as a divine dog of opportunity, capable of catching monkeys. If Zhuan Langen heard this, he would surely roll his eyes.</p>
<p>Chuan Jiqiu, the deputy head of the sound recording department, is very good at designing various sound effects and is also skilled in ventriloquism. He can imitate the sounds of a rooster crowing, a dog barking, a cat meowing, and a horse neighing, all of which are very realistic. He recently showcased his special skills in "Cimu Qu."</p>
<p>The grand Huacun scenery of "Mitu de Gaoyang" (The Lost Lamb), although having been rushed day and night for many days, has been completed, but due to continuous cloudy and rainy days recently, it has not been filmed. The schedule for shooting exterior scenes in Suzhou has also been postponed as a result. The crew is currently preparing for the main work, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e235">"Yi Duo Hua" (A Flower) Short News <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Wenhua</p>
<p>"Yi Duo Hua" has officially started filming. Xu Manli plays the lead star of the song and dance troupe in the play, who is also a social butterfly.</p>
<p>The song and dance scenes in "Yi Duo Hua" will be guest-performed by a currently highly regarded song and dance troupe. However, the performance program will still employ experienced dance teachers with the latest and most beautiful artistic techniques from Europe and the United States to provide new training.</p>
<p>The songs in the song and dance scenes of "Yi Duo Hua" are being composed by Liu Xuechang, and it is said that they are quite rich in Eastern sentiment.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun plays an unsuccessful song and dance girl in "Yi Duo Hua," while Wang Yin plays the director of the song and dance troupe.</p>
<p>The plot of "Yi Duo Hua" is a sad, enchanting, lingering, and moving one.</p>
<p>The cinematographer of "Yi Duo Hua" is Wang Chunquan, the set designer is Bao Tianming, and the sound recorder is Gu Zongyi.</p>
<p>"Yi Duo Hua" is Xu Suling's first directorial work and is also one of the films that Yi Hua Company is working hard to produce this year.</p>

<p>— Yulin</p>
<p>On the night of the fifteenth, "Huashen Guniang" filmed a scene in the department store of Wing On Company. More than one hundred employees of Yi Hua and about one hundred extras participated, as well as fifty or sixty people from Wing On. The liveliness was truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun, wearing a handsome men's worker's suit, secretly walked around Nanjing Road alone. As a result, not only was she not surrounded, but no one could discover her secret.</p>
<p>The most difficult task that night was the configuration of the lighting, because the lighting frames were all temporarily installed. Moreover, when the light shone, the bright glass windows reflected light, so in addition to cinematographer Yao Shiquan, others such as Wang Chunquan, the cinematographer of "Yi Duo Hua," also helped with the configuration, taking great pains.</p>
<p>Director Fang Peilin was so busy that he didn't even have time to enjoy barbecued pork buns, and his throat was hoarse.</p>
<p>The most hardworking and meritorious should be the electricians and carpenters.</p>
<p>The colleagues at Wing On also provided great help in various aspects very enthusiastically, which simply made the Yi Hua authorities grateful.</p>
<p>Screenwriter Emil Gu Mu also stayed up all night, taking care of things in all aspects and sparing no effort.</p>
<p>Although Wang Guilin was ill, he still worked with illness and was full of energy, not showing any signs of pain.</p>
<p>Production clerk Chen Shu and stage manager Xi Liang, and set designer Da Ming ran around without stopping.</p>
<p>There was a long shot from the west corner to the east corner, which was the most difficult shot in the whole scene, but also the most exciting one.</p>
