<h3>美財長宣布　恊助我國新幣制　卽將向我大批購銀中美兩國談判結束</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）財長毛根韜與中國財政部代表陳光甫等業已成立中美幣制恊定、其內容爲外界久經亟待、今日已由毛根鞱財長發表、謂中美兩國已成立協定、美國卽將開始購買大批華銀、購買之宗旨、在於協助中國政府之新幣制政策、並履行一九三四年美國國會所通過之購銀法、該項協定足以協助國際通貨穩定之成功、以後並準備與他國採取穩定通貨之同樣行動、但各國分別談話、實較國際會議之方法爲妥善云、</p>
<p>毛氏旋發表購買華銀之欵項、謂準備以現金或美元交付、至於購買之數量、則守秘密、惟將立刻進行、至價格則將以世界市塲每月之平均價格爲標準、</p>
<p>毛財長繼謂國務院對於中美兩國協定、深表贊同、且參院外交委員會兼白銀委員會主席畢德門、及參院共和黨領袖麥克那尼、亦深悉談話之經過、毛氏謂彼預料該項恊定能促進中美兩國之貿易、惟同時施大使則謂目前尙無使用售銀所得之欵項、以之購買美貨之計劃、</p>
<p>至於外間所傳、中國出售之現銀、至少有一部份將封存於上海公共租界、以免發生現齦流出之現象、財長及中國代表方面皆無表示、財長惟稱、依照普通習慣所購現銀輒運至華盛頓云、</p>
<p>今日宣布此事之時、中國代表亦參加記者談話、施大使並宣讀中國財政部長孔祥熙之聲明、陳光甫則答復記者之詢問、謂目前中國發行紙幣、計共七萬九千萬元、而現銀準備達四萬萬元、將來開鑄新幣、所用白銀成分、將使於銀價劇變之時、不致有融化運出之虞、</p>
<p>美財長復謂、去年所購華銀計有兩决、一决爲一千九百萬盎斯、一决爲五千萬盎斯云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）中國駐美大使施肇基今日宣稱、中國將以出售現銀所得之欵項、作爲平衡基金、用以統制法幣匯價之變動云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>我國新幣制政策　各國至感興趣　美購銀為數幾何現成為時局之謎</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）中國上海商業儲蓄銀行總經理陳光甫諸人、自與美國財政當局進行談話、爲時已一月有餘、茲已宣吿結束、財長摩根曹頃向報界發表談話稱、「美國政府曾向中國財政部代表、切實表示、願向該國中央銀行、購買大批白銀、並在某種條件之下、以美元供給之、作爲穩定法幣之助、美國政府此其所爲、乃欲協助中國、並爲國際貨幣穩定事宜、有所盡力、」（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>紐約　上海金融界所抱觀念、以爲孔部長所宣佈之新貨幣計劃、表示美國對於中國幣制已允予以援助、此間觀察者亦以爲然、衆鰓增加現金準備部份黃金與外匯之規定、爲美國已允以黃金或美元換取中國白銀之明體、不過美國將收買中國白銀、其數幾何、現尙未悉耳、衆信中國已擔任不將白銀傾銷於世界市塲、中國所以宣佈白銀準備最低限度應佔百分之二十五、並鑄造新銀幣及准許銀樓業多用白銀者、卽此故也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間金融界人士、對於中國政府、在幣制上新採措置、至感興趣、並均以爲中國財政部長孔祥熙氏之所設施、其目的係在增强該國幣制之獨立狀態、俾不受美元英鎊或日圓之牽制、且規定現金準備部份、仍以金銀及外匯充之、內白銀準備最低限度應佔發行總額百分之二十五、而外匯與金存貨則當充分增加、中國法幣保障、自己爲之穩固、不過中國幣制、並無穩定之本位、以爲强固之基礎、自仍屬一種統制的幣制耳、金融界人士、現並企待華盛頓方面、中美兩國談判結果、正式發表、則以中國新幣制政策之成功能吾持之久遠、端以此項談判有何結果爲斷故也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）財政著作家今日復評論中國孔財長星期日發表之宣言、謂中國現所有之現金與外匯、縱不能知其大的之數、然一般人士皆認爲其數必互、孔財長之宣言、已引起一般人之好戚、而美國之决議向中國購買白銀、使衆信任益堅云、晨郵報謂孔財長此舉旣有助於安定中國之貨幣、且可减少美金黃金之存底、而因以自然减小美國依白銀購買法所須購入白銀之數量、每日電聞謂此辦法固利於白銀之多方、但有一事可决者、中國在受銀價狂漲一度經騐後、必不致再作嘗試也、金融新聞謂中國之决議、實爲複幣主義之勝利、中政府已打破前取銷白銀制時似曾加入之英鎊團、中美協定之結果、使兩國金銀之比率可進至法定之數字云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）遠東時局雖在徬徨不安之中、但歐洲各國若干金融機關、正與中國某某數省代表、進行談判、冀以交換貨物方式、促進中外貿易關係、換言之、卽由各該機關向中國購買木材、鑛產品、植物油、而以鐵路機車、農具等物相交換、據聞此項談判、係由德國兩公司所發起、但進行極爲迂緩、荷蘭某公司曾在中國從事此項貿易者、爰擬將該公司在華所享利益、讓渡於英比兩國所合組之某銀團、現正在歐洲某國京城、進行談判云、但此項消息、迄今尙未證實、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>沙赫特和國社黨領袖的衝突</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>德國經濟部長兼德意志銀行總裁沙赫特和國社黨領袖間關於財政經濟政策上意見的衝突最近已由暗鬥而進入明爭的階段沙赫特漸有不容於國社黨而被排斥之勢日前希特勒授戈林將軍以監理關於原料貨幣外匯各問題的特權不啻又給與沙氏莫大的打擊復據哈瓦斯社十六日的柏林電訊這幾天來沙氏和國社黨中希特勒以下各要員間愈露積不相容的現象恐不久沙氏或將被迫辭職了</p>
<p>按沙氏本非國社黨內部的人希特勒所以引他入閣者其主要原因大致不外如下數端（一）野猪式」的國社黨黨員中缺乏處理破碎的德國經濟財政金融的專家故不得不借用黨外人才以應付難局（二）沙赫特對於各項經濟問題無不具有豐富的經騐希特勒遂用爲己助（三）沙赫特在國內經濟界金融界握有無上權威希特勒爲安定國社黨政府之財政的基礎自非利用沙氏不可同樣的沙赫特爲强化其經濟的獨裁起見也正需要運用法西斯統制經濟的手叚於是他們就互相結合了</p>
<p>但是這種結合經過相當時期以後終究免不了某種的裂痕允其是國社黨過度的急進過度的財政膨脹常致惹起財閥的反感而國社黨人員對於非嫡派的沙赫特在經濟上獨裁權之日益增强也感覺到很大的嫉忌同時國內矛盾的加深益使雙方衝突趨於尖銳蓋在國社黨黷武政策之下國內經濟狀况已陷極度危機失業普遍貿易衰落糧食恐慌原料缺乏等等都日甚一日而爲膨脹軍需用度彌補財政破綻之大量發行公債和增加租稅以及種種搜括益使人民的膏血吸收殆盡釀成社會極度的不安</p>
<p>國社黨爲企圖解决財政恐慌只有實行通貨膨脹爲企圖緩和內部矛盾只有加緊向外發展然而這些都不爲沙赫特所贊成沙氏對於國內情形倒比國社黨幾個人看得明白些他知道通貨膨脹將使德國財政金融愈益騷亂所以他反對貶低幣值等危險的手段其决沙氏固然也同樣屬於侵略主義者的一員但在程度上多少有此差別他不主張過分急進因爲怕財政經濟將發生更大的危機上决進兵萊因時聽說沙赫特輩就並不完全同意又沙赫特不僅想阻止財政預算的擴大並且要求國社黨政府撙節費用這在戰爭在熱的國社黨領袖們自然更覺無可容忍而决心把他排斥了</p>
<p>總之國社黨排斥沙赫特的原因可以歸納下述三點（一）削除沙氏在經濟上的獨裁權（二）除去軍費膨脹的製肘（三）除去通貨膨脹的阻力聞戈林膺受新命之後業已决定另行組織機關統轄經濟事務而以克羅埃脫主持其事克氏素主馬克貶值未來德國通貨政策于此已可窺見一般通貨膨脹恐僅屬時間問題但再度通貨膨脹的結果將使德財政金融前途益趨惡化而已</p>

<h3>日外相擬致力　調整對英關係　有意締結單獨軍縮條約改善通商尊重在華利益</h3>

<p>日英兩國確認兩國之間、並無不能以和平手段解决之政治的懸案　日英兩國在中國之關係、因日本在華經濟力之發展、其利害衝突之面積將必增大、然英國應認日本在東亞爲其安定力之地位、而日本尊重英國在華旣存權益、　華盛頓倫敦兩條的雖失效、然兩國之間並無誘發造艦競爭等事實、日本旣有準備與英國訂立單獨軍縮條的、　日本關於英帝國通商區域之經濟的武裝、擬與英屬領與自治領政府分別進行交涉、同時準備與英本國開始交涉調整通商關係、日本又根基於世界資源再分割論之方針、主張原料資源之自由獲得、及世界市塲之公平開放、（十九日同盟電）</p>
<h3>長嶺子衝突事件　日俄軍持鎭靜　事態不致擴大</h3>

<h3>英增厚海軍實力　美國不致反對　覆文在起草中</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）此間今日表示、英國之增加驅逐艦實力、或變更各級巡艦之總噸位、美國將不致反對、國務院今日發表、英國曾以備忘錄二件、遞交美國駐英大使賓漢、一件卽關於保留驅逐艦問題、一件為英國欲以甲級巡艦三艘改為乙級、並以甲級巡艦一艘、改為訓練艦、因此英國卽可另建甲級巡艦四艘、美國之覆文、大槪不久卽可由國務總理赫爾提交英國大使云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）英國已向國務院詢問其對於英國擬增厚驅逐艦與潛艇方量之意見、據消息靈通者言、此種請求、僅爲一種表示客氣之姿勢、因倫敦海軍條的簽字國於非簽的國建造軍艦危及其國家安全時、儘可增厚其艦隊力量、無須獲取他國之同意也、聞英國並向日本徵求意見、查英國現提議欲將其驅逐艦力量由條的所規定之十五萬噸、增至十九萬噸、其理由爲非簽的國已大增其噸數、國務院刻正與海軍當局商榷、俾草擬覆文、但此時對於英國提議不欲加以批評（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本審愼研究　認為破壞海約損及國際誠信</h3>
<p>（東京）路透電社探悉、英政府近照會日政府、請將條的內許英建造之驅逐艦、增多其數、日海軍省與外務省現正研究此項申請、海軍觀察家現信英國之提出此請、蓋鑒於法意德三國之建造潛艇、故欲以此應付之、唯英國獨增驅逐艦之噸位、足以破壞倫敦海軍公的並損及國際誠信云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）自英國向美日兩國致送備忘錄、耍求保存超出海軍條約限度之驅逐艦四十艘以後、美日兩國似已要求保留倫敦條的上所應拆毀之戰艦、日本之覆文大槪將力爭世界上最大之潛艇艦隊、海軍部今日估計日本已有潛艇二五·〇〇〇噸、故已超過條約限度之五二·七〇〇噸、尙有多艘則正在建造中、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>英政府通知美日　增厚海軍實力　添置驅逐艦四十艘變更噸位逾越限額</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國鑒於意國攫取阿國及日本增兵華北兩事、已致牒美日兩國、宣布已决予超過現有海軍條的之限額、而多置一千噸驅逐艦四十艘、美聯社今日得悉、英國曾於五月六日致牒華盛頓、表示英國願用談判方法、解决增加海軍噸位之問題、而不願援引倫敦條的、惟該牒內容、尚守秘密、據稱、牒文中亦言及某非簽孛國家、已建造潛艇二百艘、故英國須增加驅逐艦、並要求早日答覆、至於所謂非簽字國家、大槪係指意國云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國要求一九三〇年倫敦海軍條的簽字國談判增加驅逐艦噸數事、其詳情今日業已發表、英國意欲保留已過艦齡之驅逐艦四萬噸、在一九三六六年底、英國所有驅逐艦之總噸數、將達十九萬噸、其中的有八萬八千噸、皆超過規定之年齡、查一九三〇年條的所定英國驅逐艦十五萬噸與潛艇五萬二千七百噸之數字、附有與他國協定之條件、但此種協定迄未成立、而未簽定此的之他國、現已建造新潛艇一一百餘艘、故英國决定發出備忘錄、以期談判此事、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）按照一九三〇年倫敦海的規定、英國僅許置有驅逐艦十五萬噸、目前英國此類軍艦、總噸位爲二十萬噸左右、惟其中已有多艘年齡屆滿、不復適用、英國政府頃向倫敦海的其他簽字國（卽日美兩國）及法意兩國、提出照會、謂擬將驅逐艦位、維持十九萬噸之數額、卽較限額超出四萬噸、並謂、他國若果添造驅逐艦與潛水艇、則英國卽决定不受十五萬噸限額之的束、此固英國向所主張者也云云、按英國此項照會、實係要求將各驅逐艦年齡屆滿、理應銷毀者、仍予保持、此在海軍界方面亦謂英國並無在噸位限額外、建造新驅逐艦之意云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美參院批准　倫敦三國海約　反對者斥為牛酪式的條約</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）參院今日已批准英法美三國海軍條的、通過之時並未紀錄票數、按該約經參院外交委員會核准之後、向大會報吿、辯論不足兩小時卽行批准、衆院對於條的無權過問、故該的已無須經過其他國會手續矣、（十八日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）一星期前在巴爾波港外參加艦隊操演之美巡艦明尼波立斯號與一商船互撞、致艦身受損、須大修理、此事雖已發生一星期、但遲至今日始由海軍部公布之、至於與之相撞者、是何商船、則海軍部未曾言及、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>英意糾紛益深刻　艾登宣布　達姆達姆彈來源　指責意國捏造證據　意使館僱妄人行騙羅織英下院議員聞言大憤懣</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相艾登今日在下院詳述意當局指英商行以達姆達姆槍彈供給阿國車、並對此作切實之吾認、下院初皆寂然、迨外相述畢、衆多表示强烈之憤懣、外相承認意兵數人或爲達姆達姆槍彈所斃、但此彈乃游獵隊在戰事發作時離境而未及携走者、致輾轉入於部落民衆之手、並非由英商行供給、自意阿開戰後、英政府從未發給此項槍彈之出口護照、意大使署據英籍波蘭人洛貝士氏捏造之消息、揑造證據、指英商行曾以此種槍彈供給阿國、其入素多劣績、一人而化數名、曾假造之携埃及銀行介紹函、至伯明罕之喬治巴特商行、取得槍彈樣品、內有七·九式軟頭打獵彈、遂携自草之一函、致倫敦阿使署、證明此項槍彈乃英國所製、旋改名謁見阿使、願以大批軍械與子彈供給阿政府、以易讓與權、並請該使作函、許其購辦此種物品、開列一頗長之貨名單、內有軟頭槍彈二百萬發、據該使聲稱、渠並未予以允准、此類函件、今意國各報攝影製版、載於報端、其實英商行絕無售出軟頭槍彈、英政府已通吿意大使署、僱用此種不名譽之人、實不能有助於兩國友好邦交、意政府後乃撤回致國聯關於該問題之牒文云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）艾登外相頃在下議院發表長篇宣言、對於意國指責英國、以達姆達姆彈供給阿比西尼亞問題、有所答復、據稱、阿國境內富於野獸、原係著名狩獵之地、所稱達姆達姆彈或係阿國戰士行獵後所遺剩、而爲意軍覓獲者、至於阿國軍隊所用槍子、出於英國製造者、其來源曾經英國當局縝密調査、幷已向國聯會提出照會、證明意國指責各節、完全無據、幷有子彈若干發、係於二十餘年以前所製成者、</p>
<p>至是、艾登外相詳述經過情形、略謂、意國使者報、前於四月十二日將英國所製之軟頭子彈、及柏明罕貝資軍火廠於二月九日所致阿國駐英公使瑪爾丁博士一函、曁該廠寄交阿國公使館之包裹、上審「共給阿國之軍器字樣、均攝成照片、刋載報端、以爲英國以達姆達姆彈供給阿國之佐證、實則此事、完全係盤貝士上校所僞造、羅某自稱阿國代表、挾偽造之埃及銀行介紹書、往見貝資廠當局、購買達姆達姆彈、廠方當吿以此種槍彈、非文明戰事中所可使用、羅某乃謂阿國境內、遍地皆豹、至爲兇猛、非達姆達姆彈、不能制其死命、而並非用以作戰者、磋商久之、廠方常務董事貝資乃允供給樣品、中有軟頭獵槍子彈三十發、每兩發裝載一盒、當封盒之前、羅某又要求廠方具函、證明此項子彈係屬英國所製、嗣以廠方所擬函稿不佳爲詞、另由羅某口授一稿、內稱、貝資廠證明子彈樣品、確係英國製造、此函當與樣品同裝盒內、一任羅某携去、嗣後音訊杳然、直至上月、始見羅某口授之函、以及樣品之照片、均經刋載意國報端、英國政府當卽進行調査、始知羅某幷非阿國駐英公使所派、而上項樣品函件等、阿國公使亦從未收到、至該羅某又曾化名向其他軍火廠接洽同樣事件、惟均未能如願、怏快而去、</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （秋郞）　　「人生五福壽爲先，」這是說人生的壽，比任何一切，都要珍貴而不易求得，縱使有福的人，而不修其壽，這所謂「福」。也無從去享受，俗諺：「彭祖八百，陳搏千年，」總近於齊東野語，不足憑信，以現代人慾橫流之日，能享期頤之壽的，已不易多見了，那末人牛的壽祗有短短的數十寒暑，自然格外覺得可貴，不容辜負，更其逢到旬壽的年月，集諸親好友，來慶祝一番，原不爲過。　　本年欣逢蔣委員長五旬大慶之期，以委員長的勞苦功高，民衆原應該爲他稱觴祝嘏，但委員長關懐黨國，深慨時艱，更何暇顧及本人的壽誕，所以中國航空恊會，發起募捐購機祝壽的創舉，上海市徵求隊吳總隊長，登高一呼，四方響應，近來各公團·學校·工廠·商店等，各方都踴躍參加，熱烈贊助，行見尅日便可集有成數，購機上獻了。這種購機祝壽辦法，旣寓有祝壽翁福壽增高（飛機是高翔的）的意思，又是充實國防的利器，一舉而數善備，確是含有深切意義的盛舉哩。木棉  張倓　　木棉樹上鷓鴣啼，　　木棉樹下牽郞衣；　　欲行未行不忍別，　　路沒行盡郞馬啼。　　—廣州竹枝詞—　　當春風駘蕩的時候，嶺南各地開遍了木棉：一簇簇燦爛鮮紅的花，在高挺的樹上，「望之如億萬華燈，燒空欲赤！」　　大槪到嶺南各地的，都覺得那兒有兩種很別緻的樹，一種是「管郞」，一種便是木棉。　　的確，說起木棉，它那種英雄的「性像」，就很使人奇異了：它無論在那一處，只要有別的樹在一起生長，它一定比例要求高一些；如果通是木棉，今年這棵高，明年便有比它更高的。這樣競爭着，生長着，所以又有英雄樹」的名稱。　　「嶺南多豪俠之士」，有人這麼說。我想木棉也可作這樣的一種標幟吧？活的家庭  茱英　　好動，是人類的本性，所以我們在家中，住得膩煩了，得上街去散步一下子，在都市中，住得膩煩了，得出外去旅行一下子，在文明世界中，住得膩煩了，得上大沙浪去旅行一下子。總之，在一個環境中，感到乏味時，便得把視錢，移入別一環境中，以求調節。這是人類的動態的表現。　　遊牧民族的逐水草而居，在都市中人瞧來，是最有味的一種生活，爲的是他們沒有固定的住處，住居的環境，隨着日常的生活而變遷。這種生活，不是有固定住處的非遊牧民族，所可夢想得到的。　　好奇的美國人，總是幹着理想之中的事的。因了人類的好動，習性的表現，於是異想天開，把家庭，構築在四個車輸，所支持着的一輛汽車上。只須有公路的所在，不拘是冰雪載途的北國，不拘是長着稷梠樹的南方，不拘是波光漪瀲的海濱，不拘是一望無垠的沙漠，都可把家庭安置着。手口相應  　　　　這種活動家庭，雖然只是設置在一輸汽車上，可是倒也具有着臥室與廚房的二部。臥室之中，床鋪桌椅，應有盡有。廚房之中，炊具，冰箱，伙食橱等，也無一不備。電氣的設備，取光取熱的都有。只須停駐的所在，有電力的供應，便能十分便利的使用着。　　四壁是用輕金屬的合金板，所製成的，裏面托着三夾板。窗戶，是用透明的不碎玻璃所製的。雖然外面的氣候，是在泳點，或在沸點，在室內，都能不受影響的。這個屋子，雖有二百方英尺左右，可是摺疊起來，連傢具在內，也不過是二百立方英尺稍强而已。而且完全鋪設開來，若合二人之力，只需半小時的光陰，已够了。　　活動家庭的性質，雖和我們江南一帶所習見的艒艒船，沒甚分別，但其設備的完備，那自然不可同日而語了。這種活動家庭，在美國沿海諸省，已頗盛行。上海是一個東方的紐的，說不定的在最近的將來，也將有這種艒艒性質的現代生活品輸入了。吃醋  逸民　　吃醋是男女間免不了的一椿事實譬如兩個男子愛上一個女子，或是兩個女子愛上一個男子，在這種情形之下，男女各方面，多少都要發生些醋意，也有些因着醋意擴大，在男性失戀方面，因反抗力强，立見輕易地發生决鬥，像歐美閙這把戲的，實在很多很多；而在女性失戀方面，却因性情和厚，每易自尋短見，如投河，上吊，服毒，……這是伊們最聰明的犧牲好方法，也是最聰明解除精神痛苦的好方法，要找尋實例，也是很多很多，中外都是不免的，我國却更多。　　這些話，我不願意多談，也不忍多談。這種事情，總不免含蓄着有些辛辣意，其慘酷的程度，也就可想而知；但我總虔誠地希望着，在男女間最好不要發生這一類的事。勝利方面，固然登上天堂，但在失敗方面，也就够痛苦了。所以這個味道，奉勸大家倒可不必有嘗試的必耍，其味遂着必比黃連還苦呢。　　談到吃醋的事情，使我很容易地聯想到在御史台記中所記載唐管國公任壞的一段故事，爰特把它錄出，吿諸閱者：　　「唐管國公任瓌，酷怕妻，太宗以功賜二侍子，瓌拜謝，不敢以歸。太宗召其妻，賜酒，謂之曰：「婦人妬忌，合當七出，若能改行無妬，則無飲此酒；不爾，可飲之。」曰：「妾不能改妬，請飲酒！」遂飲之。比醉歸，與其家共死訣，其實非鴆也。旣不　，他日，杜正倫　弄壊，　日：「婦當怕者三：初娶之時端居着菩薩；豈有人不怕着薩耶？旣畏生男女，如養大蟲；豈有人不怕大蟲耶？年老面皺，如鳩盤茶鬼；豈有人不怕鬼耶？以此怕婦，亦何怪焉！」聞者歡喜。」　　據說，唐太宗賜任瓌妻飲酒，是醋不是酒，於是後人就把這樁故事引伸出來，凡遇男女間有類乎此的事實，便統稱爲「吃醋；」；推原究本「吃醋」之說，便是本此。這樣看來，這二字相傳也，就有很悠久的歷史，當然也就有人知其然而不知其所以然了。換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初溫　　國器道：這兩個字我也沒有專利權，我可以用，別人也可以用。平山家裏的女僕，這時用一把高柄的陶器壺，提了一壺熱水進來。因笑道：你看我請你品茗，過講求不過講求，燒水是是連銅錫壺全不用。這個水也不是平常的江水，是雨花台下第二泉的水，今天早上，我專誠託人挑了兩小桶進城來。說着，他接過壺注在桌上一把金瓜式的陶器壺裏，將水壺遞回給女僕，然後坐下，用手按了壺向國器道：我今天很高興，所以一切都是自己動手。說着，將茶壺邊一隻八角的陶器杯子，斟了大半杯茶。這茶杯子裹面，是上了白色的瓷黝的，茶斟到裏面，有一種綠陰陰的顏色。在水杯面上，浮起了一陣細細的白烟，捲着上騰。國器笑道：道茶果然是好，今天你何以這樣高興？平山笑道：上海一家書鋪子裏，用了我兩張畫稿，酬謝我一百塊錢。這是我得意之作，到底中選了。錢還在其决，書店老板，總算是我的知音，所以我很高興。他說着話，把那杯茶送到國器面前，自己也斟滿了一杯，舉起來，先輕輕的呷了一口。國器道：我看你這樣子，果然是高興，但不知道你賣的是一張什麽畫。平山道：自然是一福時裝美女。國器道：你們畫家畫時裝美女，是毫無根據，隨便畫出來的呢？還是像外國畫家畫人，有個模特呢？平山道：中國那裹找模特去，南京又到那裏找模特去？不過完全幻想出來的畫稿，那是沒有靈魂的東西，决不能够生動。國器笑道：你所畫的，旣是得意之筆，自然是有靈魂的。但不知你所借重的，是什麽人的影子呢？平山笑道：說起來，這事楚很有趣的。我前面這一條巷子裏，有一位女學生，常我到大街上去的時候，我就常常碰到他。國器正舉了杯子待要喝茶，聽到這裏，忽然把茶杯放下，望了平山道：你也遇到了一位女學生？平山道：我不是偶然遇到，我是常經過他家門口，哦哦！聽道話音，好像你也要這種豔遇似的。國器道：我有就有，也無須瞞着你。假如有的話，你是用他作書的底稿，我是用他當作文的底稿，也沒什麽稀奇。平山道：這話就不能這樣說。把一個人作畫的底稿，不過求於形式上得一個輪廓。把一個人來作文字的背景呢，那就非有情節不可。一個男子對於一個女子有情節可寫的話，這就不是一面之交的事情了。你我若是有同一樣的豔遇，那我就只有羨慕你的了。（二四）特寫倫敦中國藝展巡禮  黃覺寺自巴黎寄　　我對於本國古代藝術，平時素無研究，這决，巴黎中國留法藝術會，發起赴英，專誠參觀各美術館，尤以中國藝展，這次收羅之富（本國及各國運來的）所以便也鼓動了興趣欣然地加入。我又因爲在國內預展時已觀過一回，所以這决祗忽忽觀其大略，現在趁古物運回祖國之際，便略一寫些，以告研究本國藝術並關心於這次藝展者。　　這次倫敦中國藝展，在「量」的方面估起來，當然比國內預展時爲多，超過三倍以上。尤其是銅器，瓷器及彫刻。現在爲便利寫的起見，將各室分別記載起來。第一室陳列的爲商器，漢玉，大半多爲古代酒器，又法國收藏的銅象，也陳列在這室，是値得注目的。第二室出品，多半爲各國所收藏。如各種兵器，刀柄上俱嵌以金銀絲，精細絕倫，聞很名貴，又有陶器，銅鏡，塑壁及英國收藏的筆洗「牛」漢琉璃杯等，都爲這室的上品。第三室布置爲一中國式屋，題爲「明遠堂」陳列御案等，宋太宗的像，也高掛在這裏，馬麟的「暗香浮動」，李公麟的人物及在上海預展時很曾注目的「四樂圖」，也提陳列在這裏。又有唐畫多幀，爲美女圖，聞唐代女子多肥碩，故畫中多作鵝蛋臉，這很容易識別時代性的。第四室陳列宋徽宗畫，署名爲「天下一人」，國內未曾細視，此决在國外意外地發見，心理上感到異樣的情緒，可惜這幾個字碧眼兒未能認識，如果認識的話，不知他們的感想，又是怎麼樣？第五室陳列張驀坐像（木刻）二種，一爲英國收藏，一爲中國帶來，二者大同小異，不知誰眞誰贋。又管夫人畫的竹，也陳列在這裏，是圖爲紐的收藏，國家至寳，俱爲他國代藏，可頳亦甚可憾！在國內看見的長江萬里圖，和大米小米的畫，都陳列在這裏。第六室陳列崔子中的「桐陰博古」呂紀的「鳥」許道寧的「携琴訪友圖」宋無名氏的「江分山水」陸包山的山水，都使觀者駐足留連。第七室陳列錢選舜畫的「蟲豸」，蜻蜓數尾，眞是無上神品，我於英之Wallace　Collection博物館，覩Van　Huysum盡的水菓，蟲豸，可以追踪他的「眞而尙不能得其神」。聞此畫亦爲美國收藏，眞是我國莫大的損失。是室　陳列宋馬賁的「百雁圖」，恣態各不相同，且都生動，眞是很難能的作品，我國古代的藝人，都頗着力於寫生，所以作品都是靈活的，原作爲美檀香山收藏。黃公望的「富春山居圖」，也陳列在這裏。霄畫外又有瓷器多種，如柴窰，汝窰，官窰，哥窰，定窰，均窰，龍泉窰，建窰，臨川窰等，分別橱架，也都陳列在這裹，（外人於定窰，均窰，尤多欣賞。）第八室陳列明瓷多種，（至明代不稱窰，而稱瓷，有「孔雀綠」，「法花三彩」「白地靑花」等名稱。第九室布置最富麗堂皇，室亦最大，乾隆寳座，也陳列在正中，其實，這個座椅，不見得高妙，歐州人以他是帝王，又因他的文德武功，也有相當的使人欽仰，所以白種人的徘徊　瞻仰的很多。聽說這决在中國選集出品的時候，這個座椅，是英國人特地指定的，歐洲人崇拜英雄的心，是很値得我們虛心地注意。另有剔紅船一艘，也陳列在這室，船窗和門戶，都可以啟閉，功用等於一百寳箱，又有淸瓷很多，多爲彩色的動物，如雞，鴨，鵝，雀等，姿態生動。第十室陳列爲景泰窰並宜興陶器，有竹筍一枚，極好，並有料器多種，以「剝殼雞蛋二個，爲最出色。直能亂眞。壁間懸明淸各家畫，不如他室的每軸畫上俱罩以特置的玻璃架了。我最愛的黃山谷書「花氣詩」，也陳列在那裏。第十一室陳列古月軒瓷及各種鏤空瓷，可稱精絕。末爲一大Salon，陳列隋代佛像一尊，碩大無朋，當余等於翌日參觀地下層Royal　Academy　School時，見「大木椿往」，直之室中，詢知即係支持上面大石佛像用的，可以想見其大了。聞這也是美國收藏而出品該會的，這樣巨大的雕刻，在國內當然還有，惟不知怎樣的流入國外？盜的？還是賣買的？低徊久之而生出無限的感想。是室尙陳列淸光緒贈與英王的觚，精甚。唐三色佛一尊，也陳列在這裏，聞三色佛爲河北八佛窪之一，現存者爲三，一尊爲大英博物館所有，一尊流在美國。　　綜觀是會，默察國外人士的心理，雖一部分觀者帶着好奇心而來的；但大部分可以見出實係硏究東方文化的學者，故會場空氣甚好，報紙論調也極公正，據鄭唐二代表云：英國藝展有此盛况，除前年開幕的意大利藝展外，此堪列入第二。惟中國藝術，「今不及古」——明淸不及宋元，宋元不及盛唐，已爲會塲一致的論調。推其原因，實以古代藝術，多以「對物寫」，而明淸多憑抽象，或臨仿古人。對物寫乃每一藝術有其生命；仿古諸作，徒拾古人的形似而已。我於參觀敦敦中國藝展後，覺此點實爲近代硏究藝術者所値得注意的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言歐洲的問題眞多  閑　　自德國喊出重整軍備，撕毀羅加諾公約以後，歐洲各國，均感惶恐不安，允其是法國，更是腹心的大患，於是奔走呼號，倡議集體安全制度，作爲控制德國武力擴大的張本，若此辦法吿成，歐洲的和平，可以得到暫時保障。　　不料去年九月，意國的侵阿問題，突然而起，欲制止意國，非得英法共同合作不可，但是法國對於意國的利害衝突還淺，而英國對於意國的利害衝突較深，並且法國欲借重意國，控制德國，自亦未便過傷意國的情感，故不肯努力與英合作，英國對此，未免大不高興。　　不料意阿問題未了，而德國的軍隊，又突然開進萊茵河畔，法國於是驚惶失措，寢食不安，法國非得英國的帮忙，决不能獨力制裁德國，但是英國以意阿問題，關係較鉅，而德軍開入萊茵河問題，關係較輕，並且意阿之役，法國不肯十分出力，則德軍開入萊茵，英國亦不免假痴假呆，不肯賈力，故法國對此，亦未免不快，所以這兩個問題，到底無法解决。　　這兩個問題的起來，我得到三個敎訓，一個是，一個國家，必須自力自救，專靠他人帮忙，决不能得到一些效果，一個是，捭闔縱橫的手段，决無用處，除非兩國間有同樣的利害關係，方才可能，一個是，若自己實力充實，任何事情可硬幹下去，毫無忌憚，現在這兩個問題，雖已過去，但繼續而起者，問題正多，不知下回如何分解。　　一個是對意經濟裁制問題，現在的阿國，雖已被意國併吞，意國的議院業已核准了併呑阿國的提案，並且意王將加上阿比西尼亞皇帝的尊號，但是在國聯方面，到底曾經議决意國爲侵略國，已實施經濟裁制，若因意國業已併吞阿國，而卽承認其已成事實，取消制裁，則不免有些說不過去，若繼續制裁，則又恐意國親德，或發生別種問題，此還未曾解决之問題，而亟待解决者一也。　　一個是奧國改組內閣問題，德國之欲合併奧國，已非一日，現在進兵萊茵河畔之目的已達，第二步的目的，便是兼併奧國，現在奧國的內閣，突然改組，總理舒斯尼格，獨攪大權，親意的史泰漢堡，業已被擯去職，此事明明英法與意國鬥法，其實鷸蚌相爭，漁翁得利，安知此種糾紛，不是授希特勒之絕好利用機會，此後問題，雖難逆料，這也不能不算是歐洲未來的一大問題。　　一個是，商締地中海公的問題，此决意阿之役，英國所極力反對者，一是爲了在阿利害的衝突，一卽恐怕妨害地中海的覇權問題，現在意國旣併呑了阿國，則對於意阿間交通錢之地中海，極關重要，以後英國在地中海的特殊權利，難免受意國的影響，已屬顯然，法國有鑑於此，故舊案重提，有商締地中海公的之舉，但此問題的解决，極其困難，此又其一也。　　一個是，希特勒近擬提出之歐洲建設計劃，而其建設計劃中，有一件極大困難的事，便是殖民地的再分配問題，這個問題，眞是非同小可，現在世界殖民地最多的，便算英國，自歐戰以後，德國的殖民地，旣爲各國分派殆盡，現在要重算舊賬，再來分配一下，試問那一國肯自情自願，犧牲自己的殖民地，而拿出來重行分配？此又一極難而不易解决的問題也。　　歐洲的問題，旣複雜若此，以後演變到若何程度，雖不可知，但看現在的情形，得到一個絕大敎訓，今後的世界，非但弱小國家，苟不勵精圖治，整軍經武，不足以生存，卽在强國亦不能持盈保泰，坐享榮華，爲能保持其長治久安的企圖，故蘇俄名記者謂，英帝國獨覇時代，現已過去，刻在八面威脅中，此語却是不差，現在由獨覇時代，而將爲羣雄角逐時代，此種局勢，早已擺出庚辰婆婆  時玳　　明天就是上山進香的日子了，庚辰婆婆這天沒到田裏去做活兒，她留在家裏用花紙糊褲子褂子，開春的時候她腰腿都痛，所以就向聖母娘娘許下香願，雖然現在腰，腿，還是酸痛，香願是不能不還的。等到香紙都打點妥當之後，她魷拿着一張黃表紙去找會寫「香表」的貴年伯伯，貴年伯伯家裏和雜貨鋪裏一樣擠着那麽些人。她好容易挨到缺，就把所許的香火的數目，名稱，吿訴了貴年伯伯。沒大會兒，那張表就寫過來了，上邊的字，他看着希朗朗的，她怕他漏了什麽字，一定要貴年伯伯唸給她聽一聽。　　「不夜縣，第三區，草埠村，信人姜庚辰之妻，因病吿訴，今逢還願之辰，虔備。褲褂一套，元寳十對，香紙一份，上奉：天仙聖母娘娘之神位下。中華民國二十四年四月初六日。」　　貴年伯伯唸完，便遞給她，嘴裏誇耀的說着：　　「我寫「香表」已經二十多年了，那會出錯兒。」　　庚辰婆婆才放心的回家了。　　晚間，庚辰婆婆把她的僅有的輕易不肯穿的新衣裳找出來，放在坑頭上，她預備鷄一呌，她就起來，趕天亮就到山頂。善薩是喜歡進香早的人。　　庚辰婆婆醒來，外邊的鷄聲就格格啞啞的呌起來，她猛可的爬起，窗紙雖閃着淡薄的微光，屋裏還是黑通通，她點着燈，就收拾，把昨天晚上留下的冷</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>飯，吃了點就動手包那些香紙，接着把猪食也添了，在鷄窩外邊也撒了糧食，一切拾掇完結，她就提着包袱動身往山上去。她很興奮，腰，腿覺不出痛來，彷彿小時到山上去看賽會似的，她出去幾乎忘了鎖門。　　街巷裏的狗追着庚辰婆婆咬，她帶着顆快活的心，不知不覺的就到了雙鳳崗。套金河仍然埋在黑暗裏，議濺的流水却淸楚的送進她的耳朶，忽然一樁非常重要的事情揪住了她的思想——她忘記用熱水洗手！　　她幾乎是跑着回家的，心裏一陣懊惱，但想到「多虧自己發覺得早，要不然帶着兩隻髒手去拜菩薩，那不是更招災惹禍嗎？」她倒有些沾沾自喜了。　　趕快的燒火煮水，鍋裏的草呼呼的着，她又想起應當用胰子洗手，於是她丢下火不管就去找林拴石匠出外回來給她的一塊固本胰子，等到胰子找到，灶問的火已經由香紙包袱引上了門，她一時情急，赤手去撲火苗，不料越撲越旺，一直蔓延到房簷上的木椽了，她在喊在呌，想摸水瓢舀水潑火，那裏模得着，手忙脚亂，像失掉了靈魂似的東一頭西一頭滿的屋裏奔跑，火燄和濃烟很快的就包圍了她，昏迷了，怎麽也逃不出　　殷紅的火燄猛烈的向天空衝射，從睡夢中驚醒的隣人們，慌張的挑着水桶來救火。每一眼井上都擁着水桶，男女老少都往火塲奔跑，恐怖揪着人們的心，人聲喊呌，水桶亂嚮，鋤頭和爪鈀不停的在火中攪動！村莊陷入騷亂裏。孩子哭呌，老年人哀憐的低語着：　　「嘖嘖！受了一輩子窮，天老爺還不饒，兩間破草房也給燒掉！」　　魚肚色的白光在東方天際漂起時，火才漸漸的熄滅了。　　庚辰婆婆不見了，救火的時候，誰也沒看見她。於是大家動手翻掘那殘燼的灰土，庚辰婆婆的屍骨埋在裏邊，差不多燒焦了，　　註：「拉長」是賽會到各村裏去。特寫上海偵查所訪問記  雨　　每天，打四川路北京路走過時，總得對信託公司樓上那塊「上海偵査所」的招牌望上一眼，心里便湧起了一個疑團，這是一個什麽組織啊？如果說這是同國外的「私人偵探」那樣的組織，那末記得幾年前曾有一位西人掛過「私人偵探」的牌子，結果是遭租界常局千涉而取消的。　　「上海偵査所」是什麼呢？我想一定有許多懷着同自己一樣的疑團，而無從知道的。這樣，我覺得對這特殊的事業有訪問一下的必耍。　　在二樓的一個寫字間，一位潘先生接見了我。我第一句便問：「請潘先生告訴我關於上海偵查所的組織。」　　「我們的偵查所是專門替人家偵查的」，他說，同時拿出了一張印刷品。這張印刷品上雖然沒有什麼組織和緣起，但可以知道他們營業的部門。大槪分為四項：　　　關於偵査事項——工商信用，夫歸有無外遇，行動探聽，證據搜尋，工商市塲調査，各項保險出險情形。　　　關於收賬事項——常年賬欵代收，普通賬欵代收。　　　關於保護事項——私人保護，輪船保護，旅行保護，金銀運輸保護。　　　關於工商業務設計事項——工商組織法，科學管理實施，理財方法，營業方針指示。此外，關於地產，建築，保險等事項，據說都聘有專家。　　「那末，這是不是像外國的私入偵探一樣的呢？」　　「私人偵探在國外是很普遍的，可是在中國還不准有。」　　「上海偵査所是否經過合法的手續？」　　「無所謂合法手續，祇不過同捕房談過的。」　　「這樣，在法律上貴所的儐査員是否承認是有效的證人。比如上法庭的時候，法官是吾承認是合法的證人？」　　「雖然不能說是合法的證人，至少能够像普通人般站在法庭上作個證人。自然，對於我偵査所得的事情，法官也會考慮一下的。　　「這麽着，當你們進行職務時，是吾也具有捕房偵探那樣的便利。例如，一伴事情的發生，是需要升堂入室的，你們是不是能够？」　　「如果遇到這樣情形時，我們可以代爲報吿捕房，會同捕房偵探去的。」　　「你們是吾備帶武器，當你們在偵査工作時，遇到危險，是吾可應用你的武器？」　　「我們所接受的，祇是一些民事，並不受理刑事，所以並不會遇到危險，也沒有武器。」　　「那末保護一項，不是很有些危險性嗎？」　　「這祇是替人代僱保鑣。」　　「這樣說來，你們並沒遇到一件很困難而含有危險性的事嗎？」　　「是的，沒有。」　　「貴所是不是同捕房和公安局的戚情很好的。」　　「那也未見得。」　　「貴所有多少職員？」　　「有中西人十餘位。」　　「責所創辦多久了？」　　「一年多。」　　「最早在上海辦這樣事業的是誰？在什麽時候？」　　「我所記得的是二三年前的西人萬勒克。」　　「這一年來，那一項委託偵査的較多。」　　「是偵査一項，特別是『行動探聽。』」　　「取費怎樣呢？」　　「那是看事情大小而定的。」　　「以往，最高的取過多少？最少取過多少？」　　「最高的有幾百，最少的有幾十元。」　　「潘先生能吾吿訴我你在何校讀書與在什麽地方做過事情。」　　「在法工部局做過事情的。」　　「那末，潘先生對於法律一定很熟悉的了。」　　「也祗不過懂一些法律常識。」客氣地。　　問到這里，我覺得對於上海偵査所已有相當的明瞭了。這時，我看了這所為字間——是三間有門房可通的房子，每一間也有門可通走廊，其間有一間的門戶寫着「法律部」三字。到這里，我就和潘先生道別。播音　播音劇本蘇州人（四）  顧文宗作　　麗雅　難道Miss沈是蘇州人嗎？　　驚鴻　你覺得特別奇怪嗎？　　麗雅　這眞是我死也不會相信的事！你眞的是蘇州人嗎？　　驚鴻　人倒是蘇州人，但是沒有你剛才說得那麽惡劣。　　麗雅　那你才是我的眞同鄕呢。　　驚鴻　喔！原來你也是蘇州人嗎？　　麗雅　不但也是，而目還是世代相傳的蘇州人呢，然而我所痛恨的，就楚咱們同鄕的劣根牲，所以我要離開家鄉到北平去，剛才我的話，的確是有點兒過分，但是那些話，對你是毫無影響的，你千萬別多我的心。　　驚鴻　反正你那些話，對一部份的蘇州人總是有點兒影響的。　　麗雅　我希望這些話有影響，有了影響，蘇州的人民才能成爲强幹而有烈性的人民，假如再沒影響的話，總有一天；蘇州會成功一個極破落的縣城！將來總會到不可收拾的地步！　　驚鴻　Miss金，你倒很有點兒民族的思想呢。　　麗雅　我看你，未必不是我的同志吧？　　驚鴻　也許我的知識，學問，閱歷，都够不上做你的同志吧？　　麗雅　我看是行了，够了，足够了！　　驚鴻　不！不够！的確不够！我以為你的思想，正好　跟那個；蘇州男子成爲司志。</p>

<h3>US Treasury Secretary Announces Assistance for China's New Currency System: Large-Scale Silver Purchase from China to Commence Soon; Sino-American Negotiations Concluded</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Chinese Ministry of Finance representative Chen Guangfu, among others, have reached a Sino-American currency agreement. The contents of this agreement, long awaited by the outside world, were announced today by Secretary Morgenthau. He stated that the United States and China have reached an agreement whereby the United States will begin purchasing large quantities of Chinese silver. The purpose of this purchase is to assist the Chinese government's new currency system policy and to fulfill the Silver Purchase Act passed by the US Congress in 1934. This agreement is sufficient to assist in the success of international currency stabilization, and preparations are underway to take similar actions to stabilize currencies with other countries. However, separate talks with each country are more appropriate than an international conference, he said.</p>
<p>Morgenthau then announced the funds for purchasing Chinese silver, stating that they are prepared to pay in cash or US dollars. The quantity to be purchased will be kept secret, but the process will begin immediately. The price will be based on the average world market price for each month.</p>
<p>Secretary Morgenthau continued, stating that the State Council has expressed its strong support for the Sino-American agreement. Furthermore, Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Silver Committee, and Senator McNary, leader of the Senate Republicans, are also well aware of the details of the talks. Morgenthau said he anticipates that the agreement will promote trade between the United States and China. However, Ambassador Shih stated that there are currently no plans to use the proceeds from the silver sales to purchase American goods.</p>
<p>Regarding rumors that at least part of the silver sold by China will be stored in the Shanghai International Settlement to prevent the phenomenon of silver outflow, neither the Treasury Secretary nor the Chinese representatives commented. The Secretary only stated that, according to common practice, the purchased silver is usually transported to Washington.</p>
<p>When this matter was announced today, the Chinese representatives also participated in the press conference. Ambassador Shih also read a statement from Chinese Minister of Finance Kung Hsiang-hsi, and Chen Guangfu answered reporters' questions. He stated that the current total value of banknotes issued in China is 790 million yuan, with silver reserves of 400 million yuan. The silver content used in the new coins to be minted in the future will ensure that they will not be melted down and exported in the event of drastic silver price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The US Treasury Secretary added that the amount of Chinese silver purchased last year included two resolutions, one for 19 million ounces and one for 50 million ounces. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shih Chao-chi announced today that China will use the funds from the sale of silver as an equalization fund to control fluctuations in the exchange rate of the legal currency (fapi). (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Countries Show Great Interest in China's New Currency Policy; The Number of US Silver Purchases Now a Mystery</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Commercial Bank of China in Shanghai, and others have been in talks with US Treasury officials for more than a month, which have now concluded. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the press, "The US government has clearly expressed to the representatives of the Chinese Ministry of Finance its willingness to purchase large quantities of silver from the Central Bank of that country and, under certain conditions, to provide it with US dollars to help stabilize the legal currency. The US government is doing this to assist China and to do its part for international monetary stability." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>New York. Financial circles in Shanghai believe that Minister Kung's announced new monetary plan indicates that the United States has agreed to assist China's currency system. Observers here also believe this to be the case. The provision that the cash reserve should include a portion of gold and foreign exchange is clear evidence that the United States has agreed to exchange gold or US dollars for Chinese silver. However, the amount of Chinese silver that the United States will buy is still unknown. It is generally believed that China has undertaken not to dump silver on the world market. This is why China announced that the minimum silver reserve should be 25 percent, and that new silver coins would be minted and silver shops would be allowed to use more silver. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Financial circles here are very interested in the new measures taken by the Chinese government in its currency system. They all believe that the measures taken by Chinese Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi are aimed at strengthening the independence of the country's currency system, so as not to be constrained by the US dollar, the British pound, or the Japanese yen. It is also stipulated that the cash reserve should still be filled with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, with the minimum silver reserve accounting for 25 percent of the total issuance, and foreign exchange and gold reserves should be fully increased. China's legal currency guarantee is solidified by itself, but China's currency system does not have a stable standard as a strong foundation, and it is still a controlled currency system. Financial circles are now awaiting the official publication of the results of the Sino-American negotiations in Washington, as the success and longevity of China's new currency system policy will depend on the outcome of these negotiations. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Financial writers today again commented on the declaration made by Chinese Finance Minister Kung on Sunday, saying that although the exact amount of cash and foreign exchange currently held by China is unknown, it is generally believed to be considerable. Minister Kung's declaration has aroused general interest, and the US decision to purchase silver from China has strengthened public confidence. The Morning Post said that Minister Kung's move not only helps to stabilize China's currency, but also reduces the US dollar and gold reserves, and thus naturally reduces the amount of silver that the United States needs to purchase under the Silver Purchase Act. The Daily Telegraph said that this method is beneficial to silver in many ways, but one thing is certain: after experiencing a surge in silver prices, China will not try again. The Financial News said that China's decision is a victory for the bi-metallic system. The Chinese government has broken away from the sterling bloc it seemed to have joined when it abolished the silver system. As a result of the Sino-American agreement, the ratio of gold to silver between the two countries can be advanced to the statutory figure. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the situation in the Far East is uncertain, several financial institutions in Europe are negotiating with representatives from several provinces in China to promote Sino-foreign trade relations through the exchange of goods. In other words, these institutions will purchase timber, mineral products, and vegetable oils from China, and exchange them for railway locomotives, agricultural implements, and other goods. It is reported that these negotiations were initiated by two German companies, but the progress is very slow. A Dutch company that has been engaged in this type of trade in China intends to transfer the benefits it enjoys in China to a certain banking consortium jointly formed by Britain and Belgium. Negotiations are currently underway in a capital city in Europe, but this news has not yet been confirmed. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Smuggled Goods Pile Up in Tianjin Awaiting Sale; Tianjin Customs Superintendent Visits Lin Shize to Discuss Implementation of New Anti-Smuggling Law</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) As of the 19th, 450,000 bags of sugar were stored in a certain concession in Tianjin, with a market price of 17.3 yuan per bag. According to market sales, 16,000 to 17,000 bags are sold each month, with a maximum of 30,000 bags. Due to the low prices, the highest sales volume was 50,000 bags. Currently, the inventory is sufficient for nine months of sales, so smugglers are desperately seeking smuggling channels to reduce cost pressures. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 19th, Tianjin Customs Superintendent Xu Liya and Anti-Smuggling Section Tax Superintendent Qi Fangcai visited Lin Shize to discuss the implementation of the Ministry of Finance's new anti-smuggling law. Lin went to Beiping in the evening to consult Song Zheyuan. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Customs and the authorities of the Beining and Jinpu Railways decided to discuss the details on the 20th to ensure that the procedures are strict and do not involve foreign affairs. On the 19th, Tianjin Customs Secretary Li Tingyuan visited Feng Heming, director of the Jinpu Railway's Tianjin office, to discuss this matter. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Currently, 7,000 bags of sugar are stockpiled at Dainan Temple Camp in Beidaihe, Hebei, waiting to be transported to Tianjin. Currently, the market price of sugar in Dalian is 11 yuan per bag, and the transportation cost to eastern Hebei is 1 yuan per bag. The shipping cost from eastern Hebei to Tianjin is 6 yuan per bag, so it must be sold for more than 18 yuan after arriving in Tianjin to avoid losses. However, due to the excessive amount of smuggled goods in the Tianjin market, the price is only 17.3 yuan per bag, resulting in a loss of 0.7 yuan. Smugglers are complaining bitterly. For artificial silk white cloth, one package of Dachiao brand is priced at 85 yuan in the Tianjin market, and Tianshan brand is 90 yuan. The current market price in Dalian for Tianqiao is 63 yuan, and Tiantan is 67 yuan. The shipping cost from Dalian to Tianjin is 25 yuan per package, so the cost of Tianqiao is 86 yuan, and Tianfan is 92 yuan, resulting in a loss of 2-3 yuan per package. Smugglers are currently trying to bribe transportation agencies to help with smuggling in order to avoid losses. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng said that regarding railway assistance in anti-smuggling, the railway will do its best to assist within the possible scope to achieve practical results. However, the situation in Tianjin is special for customs officials to enter the station to inspect goods, and careful consultation is necessary before implementation. The railway has telegraphed the Hebei-Chahar Political Council for instructions. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The new anti-smuggling law of the Customs still focuses on requiring a customs tax bill for all goods consigned to the railway, otherwise, transportation will be refused. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggled cotton cloth is selling well in Tianjin. Currently, 9,000 bales of cotton yarn and 20,000 small bales of cotton cloth are stockpiled in a certain concession. The market price for 16-count coarse yarn is 220 yuan, 20-count is 240 yuan, and 32-count fine yarn is 241 yuan. Shuang Feilong cotton cloth sells for 7.5 yuan per bolt, and Hua Niao fine cloth sells for 6.85 yuan. Due to sales in eastern Shandong and southern Hebei, the market situation has improved, and smugglers are mostly transshipping this type of goods. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lin Shize has reached a decision with the Beining authorities in Tianjin on joint anti-smuggling measures by the Customs and the railway. He arrived in Beiping tonight to report everything to Song Zheyuan. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Pays Attention to Smuggling in North China; Deeply Concerned that It Will Hinder British Claims</h3>
<p>(London) The trend of smuggling in northern China is rapidly expanding, not only affecting legitimate trade greatly, but also reducing China's tariff revenue, which will hinder British claims (some of China's loans to Britain are secured by tariffs). The China Issues Subcommittee of the Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament has scheduled a meeting in the House of Commons tomorrow to discuss this issue. The chairman of the subcommittee is Lord Winterton. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Negotiations to Stop Troop Increase; Japanese Side Has Not Yet Responded</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, after our ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, negotiated with Japan to stop the increase of troops, Xu has formally filed negotiations with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side has not yet made a specific response. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Japanese transport ship will carry 1,000 Japanese soldiers whose terms of service have expired to Qinhuangdao today. Most of the expired soldiers had already left for Tianjin by train yesterday. Another group is scheduled to depart on June 3. After these people leave, 3,000 new soldiers will arrive here to replace them within two weeks. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Bay Massacre; Guangdong Provincial Government Files Protest</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) On April 23, 7,000 residents of Guangzhou Bay gathered to petition the government to abolish the head tax levied by the French authorities. French police suddenly opened fire, killing seven people and wounding fifteen. Now, the Guangdong government's foreign affairs officer, Gan Jieshi, has filed a serious protest with the French consul in Guangzhou, demanding that the perpetrators be punished, the families of the dead and wounded be compensated for their losses, and the tax rate be reduced. A delegation from Guangzhou Bay has petitioned the local authorities, saying that since Guangzhou Bay was placed under French jurisdiction in 1900, taxes have become increasingly heavy, and the people cannot bear the burden.

<h3>The Conflict Between Schacht and the National Socialist Party Leaders</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The conflict between German Minister of Economics and President of the Reichsbank Hjalmar Schacht and the leaders of the National Socialist Party regarding financial and economic policies has recently escalated from behind-the-scenes infighting to open struggle. Schacht is gradually becoming intolerable to the National Socialist Party and is facing expulsion. Recently, Hitler granted General Göring the special power to oversee issues related to raw materials, currency, and foreign exchange, which is nothing less than a major blow to Schacht. Furthermore, according to a Berlin dispatch from Havas on the 16th, the incompatibility between Schacht and the key members of the National Socialist Party below Hitler has become increasingly apparent in recent days, and it is feared that Schacht may soon be forced to resign.</p>
<p>Schacht himself is not an insider of the National Socialist Party. The main reasons why Hitler brought him into the cabinet are roughly as follows: (1) The "wild boar" style members of the National Socialist Party lack experts in handling the fragmented German economy, finance, and banking, so they have to borrow talent from outside the party to cope with the difficult situation. (2) Schacht has extensive experience in various economic issues, so Hitler used him as an aid. (3) Schacht holds supreme authority in the domestic economic and financial circles, and Hitler must use Schacht to stabilize the financial foundation of the National Socialist Party government. Similarly, Schacht also needs to use the fascist methods of controlling the economy to strengthen his economic dictatorship. Therefore, they combined with each other.</p>
<p>However, after a considerable period of time, this kind of combination will inevitably lead to some kind of crack. It is true that the National Socialist Party's excessive radicalism and excessive financial expansion often cause resentment from the financial groups, and the National Socialist Party members also feel great jealousy about the increasing economic dictatorship of the non-direct descendant Schacht. At the same time, the deepening of domestic contradictions has made the conflict between the two sides more acute. Under the National Socialist Party's policy of militarism, the domestic economic situation has fallen into extreme crisis. Widespread unemployment, declining trade, food panic, and lack of raw materials are all becoming increasingly serious. The large-scale issuance of bonds and increased taxes to make up for the financial deficits of the expanding military expenditure, as well as all kinds of searches, have almost absorbed the people's fat, leading to extreme social unrest.</p>
<p>In an attempt to solve the financial panic, the National Socialist Party can only implement currency inflation; in an attempt to alleviate internal contradictions, it can only intensify external development. However, Schacht does not approve of these. Schacht sees the domestic situation more clearly than a few people in the National Socialist Party. He knows that currency inflation will make German finance and banking more chaotic, so he opposes dangerous means such as devaluing the currency. It is determined that Schacht is also a member of the aggressive faction, but there is some difference in degree. He does not advocate being too radical because he fears that greater crises will occur in finance and economy. When deciding to advance troops into the Rhineland, it is said that the Schacht generation did not completely agree. Moreover, Schacht not only wants to prevent the expansion of the financial budget, but also requires the National Socialist Party government to economize on expenses. This is naturally even more intolerable to the National Socialist Party leaders who are in the heat of war and are determined to expel him.</p>
<p>In short, the reasons for the National Socialist Party's expulsion of Schacht can be summarized in the following three points: (1) Eliminating Schacht's economic dictatorship; (2) Removing the constraints on military expenditure expansion; (3) Removing the obstacles to currency inflation. It is heard that after Göring received the new order, he has decided to set up another agency to control economic affairs and to have Kroehltal preside over it. It can be seen from this that Kroehltal, who has always advocated the devaluation of the Mark, has already gained general insight into future German currency policy. Currency inflation is only a matter of time, but the result of repeated currency inflation will only make Germany's financial and banking future even worse.</p>

<h3>New Company Order from Japanese Army in North China; Lieutenant General Tashiro Arrives in Tianjin; Welcome with Gun Salutes Unprecedented; Says Japan's Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Changan Maru arrived at Tanggu at 11:20 a.m. on the 19th. Tashiro and Staff Officer Ishii landed and were welcomed by the local garrison, the civilian regiment, the veterans' association, and students. They went to the Army Transportation Department to rest and met with Chief of Staff Nagami, Police Captain Ikegami, Aide-de-Camp Jinbo, and Police Chief Wakui who came to greet them. After lunch, they changed to the armored steamship Hieizan Maru at 1:00 p.m. and sailed up the Haihe River. At 4:05 p.m., they arrived in Tianjin. At the Mitsui Wharf in the Japanese Concession, they were greeted by Tada, Senior Staff Officer Iida, Staff Officers Nakai, Ikeda, and Rindo, attached officers Hamada and Nagamine, Brigade Commander Kawabe, Regiment Commanders Mutaguchi and Kayashima, veterans, Consul Anishi, Vice Consul Nishida, Chairman Mori of the Mutual Aid Association, the Boys' Corps, the Volunteer Corps, the National Defense Women's Association, and more than 2,000 male and female students, divided into several rows.

<h3>Changing to the Silver Dollar System: Guangdong Agrees in Principle; Tang Haian Consulted with Chen Lin, etc. Yesterday</h3>

The change to the silver dollar system in Guangdong and Guangxi can be implemented in the short term. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Haian said on the 19th that he attended a meeting at the Guangdong Finance Department on the afternoon of the 18th, attended by Chen Jitang, Lin Yungai, Qu Fangpu, and others. I reported to Chen and others on Kong's reforms to the Guangdong currency system and anti-smuggling opinions. Chen and others accepted the principle of changing to the silver dollar system. However, because Guangdong has always used small silver coins as the standard, once the system is changed, public revenue and expenditure and private transactions will be affected. How to recover the Guangdong legal currency is also a problem. Chen and others advocated finding a proper solution first, holding a slow meeting, and then discussing it again. In the future, the Ministry of Finance may send experts to Guangdong to study and then implement it. My intention is to implement it in stages, and Chen and others agree. The newly revised anti-smuggling measures in North China will be followed in Shantou anti-smuggling in the future. Kong is determined to protect Guangdong sugar with tariffs and will not reduce taxes. I will return to Zhongshan on the 20th and come to the province again on the 24th to continue discussions.

<h3>Anhui Tea Transported via the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Anhui black tea has a long-standing reputation, and the annual sales overseas are very large. The Economic Commission and the Ministry of Industries have repeatedly instructed on technical improvements to increase exports.

Now, in order to facilitate transportation, the Ministry of Railways has requested that it be changed to direct transportation by the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway through the Jiangnan Railway Company. Starting this month, for a period of two months, the route stipulates that on the highway, there will be no change of vehicles from Qimen to Yicheng, and then the company will prepare freight cars to transport directly to Shanghai for distribution overseas.

<h3>The Judicial Yuan Interprets Various Ambiguities in the Negotiable Instruments Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan interprets various ambiguities in the Negotiable Instruments Law:</p>
<p>1.  The phrase "failure to notify within the period mentioned in Article 86" in Article 90 of the Negotiable Instruments Law includes both cases where notification is made outside the period and cases where no notification is made.</p>
<p>2.  If a request to draw up a protest certificate is not made within the period mentioned in Article 128 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the right of recourse against the drawer is not lost, regardless of whether a supplementary request to draw up the certificate is made later.</p>
<p>3.  According to the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Enforcement Rules of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the issuance of negotiable instruments after the enforcement of the law shall not have the effect of negotiable instruments unless it complies with the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Law. The Supreme Court's ruling No. 2451 of the 18th year of the Republic of China only pertains to negotiable instruments issued before the enforcement of the Negotiable Instruments Law that are of the same nature as bills of exchange, promissory notes, and checks. It does not apply to negotiable instruments issued in accordance with the Negotiable Instruments Law after the enforcement of the law. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Interpretation: Ambiguities Regarding Gambling in Public Places</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Higher Court submitted a request for interpretation: 1. Does gambling for property in public places under the pretext of weddings, birthdays, or celebrations by stores or households constitute a crime of gambling? 2. Is there a limit or standard for items for temporary entertainment in the proviso of Article 266 of the Criminal Law? Can gambling tools such as mahjong, pai gow, poker, and playing cards be regarded as entertainment? After deliberation by the Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference, it was decided that gambling for property in public places should constitute a crime under Article 266 of the Criminal Law. The proviso in the same article refers to items for temporary entertainment being used for the purpose of gambling, and is unrelated to the nature of the gambling tool. It has been instructed to comply. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Plans to Devote Effort to Adjusting Relations with Britain: Intends to Conclude a Separate Military Reduction Treaty, Improve Trade, and Respect Interests in China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The recent active nature of Soviet Russia's Far Eastern policy appearing in the atmosphere on the Soviet-Manchurian border has placed the focus of Japanese foreign policy on adjusting diplomatic relations with Russia. Japanese-British diplomacy is also of major importance to Japanese-Russian diplomacy. Foreign Minister Arita believes it is necessary to secure Britain's goodwill understanding of Japan's implementation of its continental policy. When drafting the instructions for the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Britain, he took the above matters into consideration and strived for cooperation between Japan and Britain. The points that should be noted in Foreign Minister Arita's policy of adjusting Japanese-British relations are generally as follows:</p>
<p>Japan and Britain confirm that there are no political issues between the two countries that cannot be resolved by peaceful means. The relations between Japan and Britain in China will inevitably increase the area of conflict of interest due to the development of Japan's economic power in China. However, Britain should recognize Japan's position as a stabilizing force in East Asia, and Japan respects Britain's existing rights and interests in China. Although the Washington and London treaties have expired, there has been no fact of inducing naval construction competition between the two countries. Japan is prepared to conclude a separate military reduction treaty with Britain. Regarding the economic armament of the British imperial trade area, Japan intends to negotiate separately with the governments of British colonies and dominions. At the same time, it is prepared to start negotiations with Britain to adjust trade relations. Japan, based on the principle of re-division of world resources, advocates the free acquisition of raw material resources and the fair opening of world markets. (Domei dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Changlingzi Conflict Incident: Japanese and Russian Troops Remain Calm; Situation Is Unlikely to Escalate</h3>
<p>Seoul: According to the Korean Army Headquarters, after the conflict between Japanese and Soviet troops near Changlingzi on the 13th of this month, Soviet troops immediately retreated, and Japanese and puppet troops also stopped reinforcing, thus easing the atmosphere. The incident is unlikely to escalate, it is said. (Hualian dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Demand that the Soviet Union Withdraw Troops from the Far East: Note Is Being Drafted</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, based on the decision of the "Three-Minister Conference," plans to formally propose to the Soviet Union within days that it withdraw or reduce the Red Army in the Far East. The note is currently being drafted by Secretary Bai. (Hualian dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Hokkaido Establishes an Air Force to Defend Against Russia: House Subcommittee Passes a Motion; Army Political Vice Minister Expresses Opinions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, the Soviet Union concentrated more than 30 powerful submarines in Vladivostok, rapidly preparing war materials. It is also rumored that it is preparing 80 heavy bombers capable of continuously flying 2,500 miles. The Japanese Army and Navy are paying close attention to the Soviet Union's concentration of forces in the Far East. To prepare for the defense of northern Japan, Democratic Party member Inatomi Kosaburo proposed the following plan at the Second Subcommittee of the House of Representatives on the 19th:</p>
<p>Proposal Regarding the Defense of the Soya Strait</p>
<p>Proposal Regarding the Establishment of an Air Force in Hokkaido</p>
<p>It has been decided that the entire committee approved. (Domei dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Second Subcommittee of the House of Representatives on the 19th, a proposal for the defense of Hokkaido was passed. At that time, Army Parliamentary Vice-Minister Tatsumi immediately expressed the views of the Army authorities on the podium: "Our defense should gradually aim to be completed. However, the Soya Strait is related to the Treaty of Portsmouth and must be studied before it can be implemented. As for the proposal to establish a new air force in Hokkaido, the establishment of troops should not only be viewed from a military perspective, but also from an economic perspective. Therefore, the establishment of the above-mentioned troops should also be carefully studied." (Domei dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>The US and Finland Sign a Reciprocal Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull and Finnish Minister Procope today jointly signed a reciprocal trade agreement, which provides for mutual reduction of tariffs. (Guomin dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Britain Increases Naval Strength: The United States Will Not Oppose It; Reply Is Being Drafted</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was indicated here today that the United States would not oppose Britain increasing its destroyer strength or changing the total tonnage of cruisers of all classes. The State Department announced today that Britain had submitted two memoranda to the US Ambassador to Britain, Bingham. One was on the issue of retaining destroyers, and the other was that Britain wanted to convert three Class A cruisers to Class B and one Class A cruiser to a training ship. Therefore, Britain could build four more Class A cruisers. The US reply is likely to be submitted to the British Ambassador by Secretary of State Hull soon. (Guomin dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Britain has inquired of the State Department its opinion on Britain's plan to increase the tonnage of destroyers and submarines. According to well-informed sources, this request is merely a gesture of politeness, because signatories to the London Naval Treaty may increase their fleet strength if non-signatory countries build warships that endanger their national security without obtaining the consent of other countries. It is heard that Britain has also sought opinions from Japan. Britain is currently proposing to increase its destroyer strength from the 150,000 tons stipulated in the treaty to 190,000 tons. The reason is that non-signatory countries have greatly increased their tonnage. The State Department is currently consulting with naval authorities to draft a reply, but it does not want to criticize the British proposal at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan Carefully Studies: Believes That Destroying the Naval Treaty Damages International Trust</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Reuters has learned that the British government recently notified the Japanese government, requesting to increase the number of destroyers that Britain is allowed to build within the treaty. The Japanese Navy Ministry and the Foreign Ministry are currently studying this application. Naval observers now believe that Britain's proposal is due to the construction of submarines by France, Italy, and Germany, and it wants to deal with it in this way. However, Britain's sole increase in destroyer tonnage is enough to destroy the London Naval Treaty and damage international trust. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Since Britain sent memoranda to the US and Japan requesting to retain 40 destroyers exceeding the limits of the naval treaty, it seems that the US and Japan have requested to retain the battleships that should have been dismantled under the London Treaty. Japan's reply will likely strive for the world's largest submarine fleet. The Admiralty today estimates that Japan already has 25,000 tons of submarines, so it has exceeded the treaty limit of 52,700 tons, and more are under construction. (Guomin dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>The British Government Notifies the US and Japan to Increase Naval Strength: Adds 40 Destroyers and Changes Tonnage Exceeding the Limit</h3>
<p>(London) In view of Italy's seizure of Abyssinia and Japan's increasing troops in North China, Britain has sent notes to the US and Japan, announcing that it has decided to exceed the limits of the existing naval treaty and add 40 destroyers of 1,000 tons. The Associated Press learned today that Britain sent a note to Washington on May 6, stating that Britain is willing to use negotiation methods to resolve the issue of increasing naval tonnage and is unwilling to invoke the London Treaty. However, the content of the note is still kept secret. It is said that the note also mentions that a certain non-signatory country has built 200 submarines, so Britain must increase destroyers and requests an early reply. The so-called non-signatory country is likely to be Italy. (Guomin dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The details of Britain's request to the signatories of the 1930 London Naval Treaty to negotiate an increase in destroyer tonnage have been released today. Britain intends to retain 40,000 tons of destroyers that have exceeded their service life. By the end of 1936, the total tonnage of all British destroyers will reach 190,000 tons, of which 88,000 tons will exceed the prescribed age. The figures of 150,000 tons for British destroyers and 52,700 tons for submarines stipulated in the 1930 treaty are attached to the conditions of agreement with other countries, but such agreements have not yet been established, and other countries that have not signed the treaty have now built more than 100 new submarines. Therefore, Britain decided to issue a memorandum in order to negotiate this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the 1930 London Naval Treaty, Britain is only allowed to have 150,000 tons of destroyers. Currently, the total tonnage of such warships in Britain is about 200,000 tons. However, many of them have reached the end of their service life and are no longer applicable. The British government recently issued a note to the other signatories of the London Treaty (i.e., the US and Japan) and France and Italy, stating that it intends to maintain the destroyer tonnage at 190,000 tons, which is 40,000 tons more than the limit. It also stated that if other countries add destroyers and submarines, Britain will decide not to be bound by the 150,000-ton limit of the treaty. This is what Britain has always advocated. According to the naval community, Britain does not intend to build new destroyers outside the tonnage limit, but rather retain the destroyers that should have been destroyed after reaching the end of their service life.

<h3>The US Senate Approves the London Three-Nation Naval Treaty: Opponents Denounce It as a Swiss Cheese Treaty</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today approved the London Naval Treaty without recording the vote. Only a small part of the opposition was there. The opponents denounced it as a Swiss cheese treaty because the treaty is all hollow. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today approved the British, French, and American naval treaty. It was passed without recording the vote. After the treaty was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it was reported to the General Assembly. It was approved after less than two hours of debate. The House of Representatives has no right to interfere with the treaty, so the treaty does not need to go through other congressional procedures. (Guomin dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Britain Invites Poland and Other Countries to Participate in the Naval Treaty: Poland Will Conduct Negotiations</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The British government had previously invited Poland and other countries to join the British, American, and French naval treaty (i.e., the one signed in London on March 23). The Polish government has instructed its ambassador to Britain, Raczyński, to immediately conduct negotiations with the British authorities and has dispatched naval expert Colonel Szolerski to London to assist.

It is scheduled to return to Japan on November 16 of this year. The squadron is commanded by Vice Admiral Yoshida Zengo and includes 124 midshipmen, 42 engineer midshipmen, and 15 paymaster midshipmen. (Domei dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>羅斯福新政　又遇重大打擊　格飛煤案與勞工支配　法院判為違憲</h3>
<p>(Washington) Two major blows have struck the new American measures again. Today, the Supreme Court announced the Guffey Coal Act, whose purpose was to make central fixed anthracite operators, unconstitutional. At the same time, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia also announced that the Labor Management Bureau established in 1935 was illegal in transferring laborers. Labor management was part of the 1935 relief plan. Now, the ruling of the Court of Appeals also determines that the entire relief plan is illegal, which has a huge impact. Therefore, the government has decided to appeal to the Supreme Court in an attempt to overturn the original judgment of the Court of Appeals. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>Ministry of Justice</p>
<p>Explains Doubts on Handling Parole</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice replied to the Higher Court of Hebei regarding the handling of parole. It stated that those who did not report the names of prisoners to the Ministry during the implementation period of the Provisional Regulations for Improving Prisons cannot be processed according to these regulations after the implementation period expires. However, since the prisons applied for parole during the implementation period, and the court did not handle it according to the telegram, the fault lies with the court. This should not cause the prisoners to be disappointed. These prisoners should still be allowed to be processed according to the regulations, and the personnel in charge should be investigated to find out why they failed to report the cases. Their names and positions should be listed, and appropriate punishments should be given as a warning. An order has been issued to comply with this. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

The Ministry has ordered all its affiliated institutions to supervise prison officials and personally inspect the walls and buildings of the prisons. If there are cracks or damages, workers should be hired immediately to repair them completely. If there is any further delay that leads to injuries or deaths, strict legal action will be taken.

<p>A Travelogue of Qinghai (Continued) - Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>(3) Qunke Beach Mongol Banners - Myths of the Sea</p>
<p>Qinghai is a mysterious place with many myths.</p>
<p>It is said that there are one hundred and eight rivers flowing into the sea, suitable for one hundred and eight parts of the Tibetan scriptures. The river water flows into the sea all year round, but the sea water is always the same. Because the surrounding sand mountains are alive, they can absorb the water. Therefore, the Tibetans call the sand mountains "sea tigers."</p>
<p>It is impossible to travel by boat on the sea. Sea and land transportation is only possible during the winter when it freezes. One year, two foreigners did not believe the Tibetans and sailed a small boat to the center of the sea. Suddenly, a great storm arose on the calm sea. Later, only the shadow of the boat was seen disappearing in the misty waves, and they were never seen again.</p>
<p>Dragon foals are produced on the sea, able to travel a thousand miles a day and eight hundred miles at night. Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty demanded dragon foals, so he released a large number of mules and mares on the seashore to await the mating of dragons.</p>
<p>The Xining Prefecture Chronicle also contains the following two myths:</p>
<p>"Qinghai has a circumference of more than a thousand miles. There are small mountains in the sea. Every winter, after the ice platform, good mares are placed on this mountain. They are collected in the coming spring, and the horses are all pregnant. The foals born are called 'Dragon Breed,' and they are necessarily different. The Tuyuhun once obtained Persian grass horses and put them into the sea, and they produced foals that could travel a thousand miles a day. It is said that the 'Qinghai Piebald' is one of them."</p>
<p>"Every year, a few days before the winter solstice, there is no fine ice in the water. One night, a booming cannon is heard from the sea, shaking the heavens and the earth. Upon inspection the next morning, the entire sea is frozen like ten thousand acres of glass. A few days before the beginning of summer, there is a booming sound as before, and the ice melts away overnight, and the water is clear and blue, without any trace of ice. The verification of the solar terms is like this."</p>
<p>Qinghai has no-scaled fish</p>
<p>The most famous product in the sea is the Huang fish. The output of fish in the northwestern provinces is very small, so its market not only occupies the entire Qinghai province, but also expands from Xining to Lanzhou. When Qinghai people celebrate the New Year, they must buy a few Huang fish as a New Year's decoration.</p>
<p>Huang fish is a kind of scaleless fish, with a narrow and long body and a pointed head, usually about one foot in length. Its height is an inch or so, its skin is dark yellow with black spots. Most of the fish sold in the market have been dried into light fish jerky.</p>
<p>The location for catching fish is on the Ximalabu Beach that we visited. Most of the fishermen nearby are Tibetans. They bring their tents to live on the beach during the fishing season. The period around the winter solstice is the busiest time for fishing. In the summer, the fish are scattered in the sea and difficult to catch. At the winter solstice, the fish form teams and swim to the shore. The most places are in a bay here. The catching method is to drill two holes in the ice before the winter solstice and one hole after the winter solstice. Attach meat bait to the iron hook, put it in the water, and the fish will be hooked. The annual output is tens of thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>The meat of the Huang fish is very fine, but we don't think it's very delicious. Maybe it's because they don't pay attention to the way they cook it. Tibetans and Tibetans don't eat fish, so the main sales are still to Han Chinese and Muslims.</p>
<p>The Qing salt eaten in this province is generally believed to be produced in Qinghai. However, the real production area is still in a smaller salt pond in Haixi. However, it is possible to boil salt from the water in the sea. Unfortunately, the industry is underdeveloped, and the goods are abandoned on the ground.</p>
<p>The seaside is full of wilderness, uninhabited, with wild horses and wild sheep grazing. The sandy beaches and grasslands, the mountains and the sea, are a natural pasture. The fact that a dragon foal is produced on the seashore cannot be regarded as a complete myth, because the mating of wild horses and domesticated horses can produce piebald foals. If we seriously develop it into a pasture, it has natural terrain and it is undoubtedly possible to produce good horses.</p>
<p>Wiping Rice Bowls with Cow Dung</p>
<p>The wind gradually subsides, the sunshine is warm, and we are reluctant to leave the beautiful and great seashore. On the sandy beach to the north, a flock of thousands of sheep came down from the head of the sand. The smiling shepherd, bowing on the sea to drink water and chewing ice shavings, also came down with two lambs in his arms. The monotonous coast immediately forms a primitive colored picture, which evokes a kind of leisurely and indifferent feeling in us.</p>
<p>It was already 2:00 PM. We mounted our horses and returned. A gallop on the sandy beach turned the great scenery into a beautiful impression in our minds. The horses ran faster on the way back. In an instant, we had passed that Nabao. The traces of wild sheep, wild rabbits, and wild chickens were still visible everywhere. The leader led us to run into a mountain gully. The owners of several tents came out to see the barking of dogs. We picked a familiar tent to rest. Only the mother and daughter were left in the tent. They very diligently lifted the curtain to welcome us in. The tent was very small, and the four of us sat squeezed on a tattered felt blanket on the spot. They added fire to boil tea while asking the leader about our news about going to the sea.</p>

<p>Yellow River Conservancy Association Proposes</p>
<p>Building a Railway Along the Yellow River</p>
<p>Shandong Provincial Government Also Makes the Same Proposal</p>
<p>Estimated Project Cost is 5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan News. In order to facilitate the transportation of Yellow River construction materials and develop Shandong's economy, the Shandong Provincial Government telegraphed the central government, requesting the construction of a railway along the Yellow River levee from Jinan, Shandong, to Lanfeng, Henan, and estimated that the project would cost 5 million yuan. At the same time, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, at the request of the people of western Shandong, also telegraphed the central government to state the need to build a railway along the Yellow River and requested that it be approved. Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan, has now approved the case and transferred it to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission for verification and has also telegraphed the Shandong Provincial Government to inform them. After receiving the telegram from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the Economic Commission also telegraphed the Yellow River Conservancy Association, ordering it to prepare a detailed plan for the construction of the railway and send it to the commission for verification. The Yellow River Conservancy Association has entrusted Commissioner Shu, Section Chief Tao, and the river defense team to expedite the drafting of the plan and submit it to the Economic Commission for verification. The original text of the telegram from Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Association, to the National Economic Commission is appended below:</p>
<p>"To the National Economic Commission, Nanjing. According to the telegrams from Wang Hengru and other representatives of the people of various counties in western Shandong, the Yellow River is a major disaster, and breaches are feared at any time. The area from Lanfeng to Shilipu is the most dangerous, relying on willow staking to protect it, which is difficult to consolidate, and the transportation of materials is difficult and slow. The only solution is to build a railway along the Yellow River to transport stone to strengthen the embankment, using the levee as the roadbed and willows and locusts as sleepers, costing approximately 5 million yuan, which can solve the problem once and for all. I implore you to forward this to the central government for consideration and implementation. Also, according to the telegram from the Co-worker Promotion Association of Heze County, Shandong, Cao County, and eight other counties, the situation is the same as above. Based on this, the case of building the Jibian Railway to transport stone and strengthen the embankment requested by the representatives and the association is related to river defense and is extremely important. The levee has been thin and weak, and the bank protection project has been simple and crude, so sudden surges are difficult to defend against, resulting in breaches year after year and deepening disasters. To prevent and correct this, we must consolidate the levees along the river to prevent future disasters. The materials for protection are of paramount importance, and the transportation of materials must be fast and efficient. In addition, during the flood season, the river situation and engineering situation change rapidly, and if the transportation is slightly delayed, the materials will not meet the demand, and the opportunity will be lost. The ability to build roads along the river to make the transportation of materials fast and efficient is of great benefit to the consolidation of river defenses and the lives of the people. In the fourth resolution of this meeting, Zhang Jingyu, a member of the committee, proposed building a light railway on the south bank levee from the Yellow River Railway Bridge in Rongze to Xiaoxin Embankment in Lanfeng to facilitate the transportation of river defense materials. Also, during the Dongzhuang blockade project last year, there was also the idea of building a stone-transporting railway from Lanfeng to Dongditou to increase transportation efficiency, which coincides with the views of the representatives. I personally experienced the difficulties in transporting materials for the Fenglou Guantai Dongzhuang blockade projects. After careful consideration, I believe that their proposal is appropriate. Although the estimated cost of building the road is as high as 5 million yuan, the losses of people's property and the expenses of government relief after each breach, as well as the costs of handling blockades and conscripting workers, amount to hundreds of millions. Instead of repairing after the disaster, why not plan ahead? Based on the foregoing, I would like to approve the request and forward it to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. I respectfully request your instructions. Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission."</p>
<p>Central Government</p>
<p>Subsidizes Shandong's Finances</p>
<p>Paid from Shandong's Salt Surtax</p>
<p>Stipulated at 60,000 Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>Jinan News. Shandong's finances have been on track in recent years, with annual revenue and expenditure of more than 20 million yuan, which is sufficient to offset each other. However, last year's Yellow River breach caused flooding in the southwest half of the province, resulting in tax arrears, while expenditures remained the same, resulting in a huge budget deficit this year. Subsequently, Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government, and the heads of the civil affairs, finance, construction, and education departments jointly discussed ways to offset the deficit and believed that even if government expenses were drastically reduced, there would still be a shortfall of more than 2.4 million yuan. The reason is that the local economy was severely damaged after the Yellow River disaster, and it was difficult to find other sources of income to supplement it. Considering that Shandong's salt tax surtax has been allocated to the central government for many years, it is proposed to request the central government to return it to Shandong to provide subsidies at this time of financial shortage and depletion of financial resources. Provincial Committee member Lin Jiqing went to Beijing a few days ago to meet with Finance Minister Kong and Executive Yuan President Chiang, and stated the difficulties of Shandong's finances, requesting that the central government approve the return of the salt surtax to Shandong as a subsidy. As a result, the central government agreed to allocate 60,000 yuan per month, or 720,000 yuan per year, as a subsidy. With this subsidy, Shandong's finances will be able to cope with the situation in the future. (17th)</p>

<p>Zhang Danzhi Sued by Divorced Woman for Alimony, etc.; Former Defendant Counter-Accuses Her of Shortcomings</p>
<p>Su Chengji from Yin County, currently serving at the Shantou Customs, had a daughter, Shengzhen, 21 years old, who had received a considerable education. Through friendship, she fell in love with Zhang Danzhi from Danyang. In the spring of the year before last, they enlisted Yin Zhiling and others to act as matchmakers and held their wedding at the Hua'an Hotel. However, after the birth of their daughter, the couple's relationship deteriorated, and they both went to lawyer Shen Zongyong's office to sign a divorce agreement, thus parting ways. However, Su Shengzhen believed that although they were divorced, Zhang should still be responsible for providing her future living expenses and the education expenses for their two-year-old daughter, Xingsheng. Therefore, she hired lawyer Shi Zhuoren to file a lawsuit against Zhang for alimony, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 10,000 yuan each for alimony and education expenses. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by Li Hu, the judge of the civil division of the Special District Court. First, the plaintiff, Su Shengzhen, recounted the facts of how they went from friendship to love, from marriage to divorce. She claimed that after the marriage, Zhang Danzhi no longer treated her with the tenderness and care he had shown when they were just friends. Then, in March of last year, their daughter was born, and Zhang's attitude became more peaceful again, and they were able to get along relatively well. However, in November, he suddenly did not return home one night. Because he had never done this before, she was very worried. Therefore, at noon the next day, she called the International Hotel to inquire about the reason for his absence. His answer seemed resentful. When Zhang returned that night, she asked him again. Zhang went to bed without saying a word. After repeated inquiries, he revealed his suicidal thoughts. It turned out that Zhang had had some kind of relationship with Jiang Xingjie's daughter before. When he married her, Zhang had vowed that he had completely cut off all ties with Jiang. Unexpectedly, at this moment, the dying embers reignited. Zhang felt that he could not bear to let down the beautiful Jiang, so he had suicidal thoughts. After that, he continued to discriminate against her and often insulted her. When she moved back to her mother's house, he followed her there and caused trouble. On February 3, she was lured to lawyer Shen's office and forced to sign a divorce agreement. At that time, Zhang said that the reason he wanted to live with Jiang's daughter was purely to covet Jiang's property. Moreover, Jiang had a lung disease that had reached a dangerous stage. She would not live much longer. Once Jiang's daughter died, they could still be husband and wife again and reconcile. They could use Jiang's daughter's property to build a Western-style house and enjoy driving a car. Therefore, they were only divorcing on the surface. Behind the scenes, they could still meet often. She was fooled by his words and signed the agreement. Zhang also gave her two alimony notes, each for 5,000 yuan. However, because they were still in contact with each other, Zhang took the opportunity to steal one of the notes. Moreover, after the divorce agreement was signed, Zhang's attitude suddenly changed. Recently, he went back on his word and no longer wanted to rekindle their old love. That is why she filed the lawsuit and requested the court to have pity on her poverty and waive the litigation fees. The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant had only given one note for 5,000 yuan, not two. Moreover, 530 yuan had already been paid, and only 4,470 yuan was still owed. He planned to pay it in installments because he did not have the financial ability to pay it all at once. The defendant, Zhang Danzhi, claimed that when he was friends with the plaintiff, he knew that she was excellent in both character and academics, so he married her. However, later, he saw that she had a wide social circle and often interacted with men. He regretted his mistake. Moreover, someone named Wang had a particularly close relationship with the plaintiff. Someone even wrote to the plaintiff, criticizing her for marrying him. He was very hurt by these incidents. The plaintiff's words and actions were often hypocritical, which made him even more resentful. At that time, he did stay out all night. When she asked him why he had not returned, he casually replied that he had another lover. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff believed him. Therefore, they often quarreled, which led to the divorce. However, this was just a superficial act. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff became even more uninhibited and danced all night with Wang. When his father was critically ill, he longed to see his granddaughter. He repeatedly asked her to take their daughter to serve his grandfather medicine. However, she left after only a short time. This showed that she only valued money and did not care about her family. Then, the plaintiff's father, Su Chengji, testified in court, saying that his daughter had voluntarily married Zhang. At that time, he had warned his daughter to choose her husband carefully. After the marriage, Zhang often wrote to him and was very respectful to him. However, recently, he suddenly received a letter from him, saying that he wanted a divorce. Therefore, he took leave to come to Shanghai to see what was going on. According to his investigation, it was true that Zhang coveted Jiang's daughter's property and tricked his daughter into signing the divorce agreement. He feared that there was no hope for a peaceful resolution of this case. The court then adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<p>Pudong Waterworks Begins Laying Water Pipes; Internal Equipment Nearing Completion, Machines to be Installed; Water Supply to be Opened After Pipes are Connected</p>
<p>The government specially ordered the Xingye Trust Company to build a waterworks to provide the citizens of Pudong with sanitary drinking water. Since the construction began the year before last, the construction and internal layout procedures have been completed one after another. Currently, the bidding process for laying water pipes is underway. Once the roads are connected, the business will be opened. The Dagong News Agency reporter has investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Equipment Nearing Completion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Xingye Trust Company's waterworks, built on Youlong Road in Pudong, has had its factory building project generally completed since construction began. Currently, the internal work and machine installation are underway. Once the water pipes are connected, the business can be opened. Then, all the drinking water and fire protection needs of the residents of Pudong can be solved, and they will no longer have the difficulties of the past.</p>
<p>Laying Water Pipes</p>
<p>The Xingye Trust Company has announced that the bidding for the water pipe laying project will begin on the 18th of this month. The announcement stated that the company's Pudong Waterworks is planning to lay water pipes (the business must be registered with the Municipal Public Works Bureau) and order cast iron pipes (from a machinery factory) that can realistically prove that they have handled similar projects with a value of more than half of this project. Those who are interested in undertaking the project can obtain the bidding instructions from the General Affairs Department of the company (66 Tianjin Road) from May 18 to May 20 for eight days, fill out the experience form, and attach supporting documents for review. After passing the review, they will be notified to receive the drawings, specifications, contract outline, quotation form, and envelope, and pay a drawing fee of 20 yuan in any currency. The bid deposit is 500 yuan for those laying water pipes and 300 yuan for those ordering cast iron pipes (cash or bank drafts). At 2 p.m. on June 8, they should personally come to the company to put the bid in the bidding box. The bidding will be opened at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Business Plan</p>
<p>After the waterworks is established, the water consumption of the wharves, factories, and warehouses in Pudong will often be considerable. Moreover, residents of factories and warehouses with water supply facilities can also reduce the cost of fire insurance. There are also more than 100 boiled water shops in Pudong. Because it is not easy to get water, the cost of transporting water from ordinary artesian wells or the Huangpu River is also high. Moreover, they do not pay attention to drinking water hygiene. In the future, after the waterworks supplies water, these boiled water shops will also be more convenient. As for the water supply to residents, water meters will also be installed. Because of the municipal government's involvement, the price can be particularly low. In addition to setting up fire hydrants in all streets in the district to provide necessary fire prevention equipment, the factory will also set up water taps for scattered sales to poor residents.</p>
<p>Users Complain about Inaccurate Metering; Telephone Association Asks Taxpayers Association to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee, because users in various districts have complained to the committee about the company's inaccurate metering, sent a letter yesterday to the Chinese Taxpayers Association in the Public Concession, requesting them to negotiate for corrections to reduce the burden on citizens. The letter stated that since the implementation of the telephone price increase in the Special District, businessmen in various industries have felt personal pain and have started to negotiate. The entire city is in turmoil. However, the company is using the concession contract with the Public Works Bureau as a shield and ignoring the situation. Therefore, the stalemate has not been resolved to this day. Recently, the committee has repeatedly received reports from users in various districts that the company's bills for the past month have inflated the number of calls. The most inflated bill was for a household that had as many as 300 extra calls, and the least was for dozens of extra calls. This has caused citizens to suffer the pain of price increases and unexpected exploitation. Telephones are a public utility, and its profits should change with the social and economic situation. There is no situation where the social economy is declining, and the telephone business can still enjoy huge profits. The open price increase still allows citizens to understand the losses they are suffering. However, now it has been discovered that there are inflated calls, which is an immoral exploitation of citizens' economy. This is no different from treating citizens like fish to be slaughtered. The committee members can only awaken the masses and use their last strength to deal with the situation. The association is the diplomatic organ of the Chinese people in the Special District and bears the heavy trust of 1.5 million citizens. If it does not stand up and fight for this serious issue, it will fail to fulfill its responsibility to protect the citizens of the Special District. Therefore, this special letter is sent to you. Please ask the Chinese directors attending the Public Works Bureau to submit a serious negotiation to the board of directors as soon as possible and immediately order the company to stop its immoral behavior. This matter is important, so please handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>Taishan Insurance Company Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>The Taishan Insurance Co., Ltd. held its fourth shareholders' meeting yesterday. The chairman of the board reported that, esteemed shareholders, as the company's fourth annual shareholders' meeting is being held, I am very pleased to have you all here. The company's accounts and business report have already been distributed to you. I hope you will read them carefully. Now, I will select the main points and give a brief report, hoping you will pay attention. In 1935, China's currency reform, the decline in real estate prices, and the difficulties felt by the financial and industrial sectors were unprecedented. It was not until the end of the year that export trade improved slightly, and the market gradually improved. The impact on the company in this environment was truly not small. After several efforts to operate, the situation is still considerable. I believe you will be satisfied with the accounts and business report. The company has always adhered to the principle of prudent and stable investment and underwriting. Last year's business policy was still based on the consistent policies of the past. Unfortunately, industry and commerce are declining daily, and insurance prices are decreasing daily. All of this is enough to reduce the company's fire insurance premium income. The number of surrenders this year was even more unexpected. Fortunately, the company's expenses are still comparable to the total insurance income. Therefore, the fire insurance department still had a small profit after settlement. The company's water insurance business is conducted in cooperation with several peers in a friendly manner. Although there were losses this year, the company's development is all good business in the ocean and in this city. After a long period of underwriting and averaging, it should be profitable. Shareholders, you do not need to worry about the current small losses. The business included in the accident insurance department mostly belongs to personal accident insurance and car insurance. The car insurance part suffered heavy losses due to the business transferred from Annam. This loss has been offset by the surplus in personal accident and other accident insurance items. As it stands, accident insurance has a good chance of developing in the future. The company's policy is to pay close attention to this business. Credit insurance was also slightly developed this year with prudent steps. The accounts are included in the accident insurance. In short, the operation of the accident insurance department is quite developed and can be reported to you with satisfaction. The life insurance department's accounts are the most outstanding in this year's accounts. Last year, due to the extreme depression of various industries, the company's policy was to strive for stability in development and to save expenses as the first priority. However, with appropriate competition in business, new business could still be obtained. Ordinary life insurance was 1,444,090.079 yuan, and group life insurance was 210,793.69 yuan. According to convention, the surplus earned during the start-up period of life insurance is all used to develop new business. However, as a result of the company's prudent underwriting and economical expenses, this year it was able to close with a surplus of 23,382.33 yuan, which is no easy feat. At the same time, as of the end of 1935, the valid new business could also increase to 4,015,305.87 yuan (including group insurance of 335,499.33 yuan). All of this is due to the sound management of the life insurance department. As for the small number of claims, although it is said to be accidental, prudent underwriting is the original factor in reducing claims. Life insurance has not yet developed to a considerable extent in our country. However, through the efforts of various peers to promote it and the establishment of simple life insurance by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the public has gradually recognized the benefits of this type of insurance. The future of life insurance is promising. Regarding investment, the company strives for stability and does not take the acquisition of high profits as a prerequisite. Therefore, it retains a huge amount of cash throughout the year, and the income is not very large. All real estate mortgages are reliable. After converting the market prices of various investments, it is estimated that they need to be devalued by 21,836.34 yuan, which has been offset by the investment devaluation reserve. However, the current market prices have already risen, and the above-mentioned devaluation has been fully offset and there is still a surplus. The total interest income from investment is 81,761.96 yuan. After allocating 7,921.63 yuan to the life insurance account, the remaining 73,840.33 yuan has been transferred to the profit and loss account. The unearned premium reserve in the balance sheet is calculated according to the usual standards. As for the allowance for bad debts, because the company has very few bad debts, no provision has been made. Regarding the distribution of surplus, according to the board of directors' recommendation, the number of public funds has exceeded the 100,000 yuan stipulated by the company law in order to consolidate the company's foundation. It is proposed to ask you to approve it. As for the distribution of 5% dividends, the board of directors believes that it is appropriate to consider the company's profit and loss situation and future prospects. Therefore, there is this suggestion, and I believe you will also agree. In addition, it is proposed to allocate 10,000 yuan as remuneration for employees and directors. The company's directors and supervisors have not received any remuneration to date. The staff has been loyal and hardworking for the company's entrepreneurship for many years and deserves some reward to show our gratitude. I believe the shareholders will also agree.</p>
<p>Opening of Jurong Pencil and Lead Mine; Conspiracy to Defraud Case; Zhao Chengquan and Four Others Accused; Special Court No. 2 Holds First Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Cai Shizhao, 45 years old, a local resident of No. 5, Lane 35, Nanyang Ju Bai'er Road, French Concession, and Le Jisheng and Shen Tongshu, owners of a sand casting factory at No. 14, Xiangli Lane, Bansongyuan Road, Nanshi, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of Special Court No. 2, accusing Zhao Chengquan (residing at No. , Xin'an Lane, Bai'er Road, French Concession, former director of the Shanghai Fishing Tax Bureau), Yan Huiyu (general manager of Dadong Tobacco Company, shareholder of Yuanyiyu Money Shop), Gao Fengwu (owner of Xiangtai Soap Factory in Wanjia Lane, Zhenjiang), and Zhao Chengquan's son, Zhao Yunlin, of conspiracy to defraud. The lawsuit stated that the first defendant, Zhao Chengquan (also known as Li Chengquan), was the general manager of Qingji Pencil and Lead Mining Company. In mid-October of last year, Zhao came to claim that the pencil and lead mine in Qiaotou Town, Jurong County, was recruiting shareholders and invited the plaintiffs to invest. After negotiation, the plaintiffs successively paid Zhao a capital of 33,900 yuan. However, Zhao recently changed his story and claimed that the mining rights had been revoked and that Yan Huiyu had been asked to reapply for the mining rights. If the plaintiffs wanted to continue operating, they would have to pay another 10,000 yuan of capital. After that, Zhao carried away all the account books, seals, and other items of the mine and fled. It was not until April 27 of this year that the plaintiffs met Zhao on the road and apprehended him. The lawsuit stated that the defendants had committed the crime of fraud under the criminal law. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Division of the court. The plaintiffs and their lawyer appeared in court to state the reasons for the lawsuit. Only Zhao Chengquan appeared in court to respond to the charges. He claimed that he had received 3,500 yuan from the plaintiffs as shareholders. The remaining 30,000 yuan was actually a blank receipt that he had tricked them into signing. The court noted that three of the defendants were not present and adjourned the hearing to 9 a.m. on May 29.</p>

<p>Recent Events in Damuqiao Civilian Village; Promote Sports, Hiking and Visits; Flower Planting Competition, Epidemic Prevention Campaign</p>
<p>The municipal authorities of this city, in order to seek the welfare of the people, have created four new civilian villages, which have greatly benefited the people. Visitors have praised them. Damuqiao Civilian Village is one of the four villages, located on the bank of the Rihui River in Nanshi. A reporter from Guomin News Agency specially visited the village director yesterday and asked about the recent situation of the village. Director Cao answered in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Promote Sports</p>
<p>The village believes that public sports are related to the health of the entire nation, so a sports department has been established. Recently, in addition to the villagers performing calisthenics every morning, they also practice various track and field events and ball games. The villagers are all interested in sports. The village's football team played a friendly match with the Kesi team on the 17th and won 3-2.</p>
<p>Hiking and Visits</p>
<p>The village's school department, in order to use practical teaching materials, led more than 170 teachers and students to the Wenmiao Road Public Education Center, the zoo, and the Penglai Market on the 16th for visits and excursions. The various bureaus provided enthusiastic hospitality and guidance.</p>
<p>Flower Planting Competition</p>
<p>Each household in the village has a five-foot open space in front of the house for planting flowers. Now, under the leadership of the village affairs office, they have completed a garden-style new village. Zhao Meiqun, a resident of No. 36, planted green grass in the shape of the four characters "Civilian Welfare," which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Other Activities</p>
<p>The village has installed a wireless telephone to receive various lectures and broadcasts from the central government and the municipal government. The reading room has purchased various daily newspapers for the villagers to browse after work. The "May 9th" meeting held a memorial meeting, and many villagers stood up to give speeches, all filled with grief and indignation. The students of the night school for the public are quite diligent. The results of this monthly exam show that 90% of them passed. Recently, the village's epidemic prevention campaign has begun. They are planning to cooperate with neighbors outside the village to fill nearby ditches and sweep away garbage in order to eliminate the breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tofu to Increase in Price on June 1</p>
<p>The tofu industry in this city has always been very developed. There are a total of 308 businesses operating in this industry throughout the city, all of which are small-scale businesses. However, since the poor harvests in various tofu-producing areas last year, the cost of raw materials has increased sharply, while the retail price remains the same. As a result, businesses that have closed down are everywhere. Therefore, on the 29th of last month, the Tofu Industry Association convened all its members and resolved to appropriately increase the price of goods in order to maintain their capital. The conference also drafted a set of sanctions and set prices, which were submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has now approved the city-wide tofu industry to uniformly increase prices from June 1. The prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Old Tofu, 1,600 cash per board, 100 cash per piece, minimum 50 cash</p>
<p>Soft Tofu, 1,200 cash per board, minimum 30 cash</p>
<p>Tofu Skin, 22 cents per catty, 20 cash per sheet</p>
<p>Coarse Fried Dough Sticks, 24 cents per catty, minimum 60 cash</p>
<p>Fine Fried Dough Sticks, 32 cents per catty, minimum 60 cash</p>
<p>Fragrant Stinky Tofu, 30 cash per piece</p>
<p>Tofu Clothing, 3 cents per sheet</p>
<p>Triangle Fried Tofu, 20 cash per piece</p>
<p>Small Square Fried Tofu, 10 cash per piece</p>
<p>Fermented Tofu Blanks, 40 cents per board</p>
<p>Square Cut, 30 cents per board</p>
<p>The above wholesale price is 10% off</p>
<p>Cai Shengbai and Others Found Not Guilty of Defamation; Court Pronounces Judgment Yesterday</p>
<p>Lin Zhixiang, manager of the Lili Clothing Company on Jing'an Temple Road, previously accused Cai Shengbai, manager of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, and Gao Shiheng, manager of the Kaili Company, of defamation in the First Special Court. Cai and Gao also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend them, saying that the Social Affairs Bureau, fearing that the wedding dresses for group weddings would not be uniform, specially reviewed and determined that those produced by the Meiya Factory and its affiliated Kaili Company would be the standard. Later, Lili advertised that it could produce wedding dresses, so Kaili reported to the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau approved a warning to Kaili, which was hung in the window to prevent customers from being fooled. This situation is obviously justified and cannot be considered illegal. This case has been concluded by the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Qianchang announced the verdict: Cai Shengbai and Gao Shiheng were found not guilty.</p>

<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Announces Qualified Personnel of Various Branches</p>

<p>Two Railway Unions Petition the Central Government to Revise the Number of National Assembly Representatives</p>
<p>The Railway Union Directly Under the Ministry of Railways, Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, stated that the National Assembly Representative Election Law passed by the Legislative Yuan, as listed in the appendix, uniquely lacked representation for special unions such as railway, seafarer, postal, and telecommunications unions, which caused deep concern. The special unions all have a long history, sound organization, wide scope, and large number of members. Moreover, their organizations do not belong to a particular province or city, so they cannot all participate in the occupational elections of a certain place, which would inevitably lead to division and fragmentation, which is unreasonable. Therefore, they have petitioned the Special Party Headquarters of the railway to forward it to the central government, hoping that it will be adopted: 1. Increase the number of representatives to be allocated to the railway, seafarer, postal, and telecommunications special unions. 2. If the number of representatives is not increased, please incorporate the above-mentioned groups into the freelance professional groups for election, occupying 58 representative seats, and redistribute them according to the total number of members of each group. They also sent telegrams to all railway special party headquarters unions, seafarer special party headquarters unions, and postal and telecommunications unions across the country, unanimously advocating and striving for this cause. They also plan to unite with various railway unions and seafarer unions to send representatives to petition the central government.</p>

<p>Car Hits Tram on Jing'an Temple Road; Car Shattered; Tang Shuzhong Injured in Head</p>
<p>At about 10 p.m. last night, at Jing'an Temple Road, West of Ma Hall Road, a black-licensed car with concession registration number 3872 was speeding west when the driver was careless and collided with a tram on line 106 traveling east. The car was instantly shattered, and the driver, Tang Shuzhong, a native of Tongzhou, 18 years old, was cut in the head by the glass on the car door, bleeding profusely. A nearby police officer saw this and immediately went forward to question the cause of the accident and reported the details of the accident and the car number to the police station. He then sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment. It was learned that the car belonged to Bao Chengde, a native of Changshu and deputy manager of the Jianghai Bank in this city.</p>

<p>Gleanings from Spring and Autumn (Qiu Lang) "Of the five blessings in life, longevity comes first," meaning that longevity is more precious and harder to obtain than anything else in life. Even if someone is blessed, without cultivating longevity, they cannot enjoy their "blessing." As the saying goes, "Peng Zu lived to eight hundred, Chen Bo to a thousand," but these are just fantastical tales and not to be believed. In today's world of rampant desires, it's rare to see people live to a hundred, so the few decades of a person's life naturally seem especially precious and should not be wasted. It's perfectly acceptable to gather friends and relatives to celebrate a significant birthday. This year marks the auspicious occasion of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday. Given his hard work and great contributions, the people should raise a toast to wish him well. However, the Chairman is concerned about the Party and the nation and deeply worried about the difficult times, leaving him no time to think about his own birthday. Therefore, the China Aviation Association has initiated a fundraising campaign to purchase airplanes as a birthday gift. When Wu, the Chief Captain of the Shanghai City Recruitment Team, called for support, people from all directions responded enthusiastically. Various public organizations, schools, factories, and shops have actively participated and generously contributed. It's expected that the funds will be raised soon, and the airplanes will be presented as a gift. This method of buying airplanes as a birthday gift not only symbolizes increased blessings and longevity (airplanes soar high) but also strengthens national defense, achieving multiple benefits in one stroke. It's indeed a grand undertaking with profound meaning. Kapok Zhang Dan Kapok trees, turtledoves sing, Beneath the kapok, holding a lover's sleeve; Wanting to go, yet reluctant to part, The road not finished, the lover's horse cries. - Guangzhou Bamboo Branch Verse - When the spring breeze is gentle, kapok blossoms bloom all over Lingnan: Clusters of bright red flowers on tall trees, "Looking like millions of festive lanterns, burning red in the sky!" Generally, those who come to Lingnan feel that there are two very distinctive trees there, one is "Guantong," and the other is the kapok. Indeed, speaking of kapok, its heroic "nature" is very striking: No matter where it is, as long as there are other trees growing together, it will definitely demand to be taller. If they are all kapok trees, if this tree is tall this year, there will be one taller than it next year. Competing and growing like this, it also has the name "Hero Tree." "Lingnan has many heroic people," some say. I think kapok can also be regarded as a symbol of this. A Living Home Zhu Ying Restlessness is human nature, so when we get tired of staying at home, we need to go out for a walk. When we get tired of living in the city, we need to travel outside. When we get tired of living in the civilized world, we need to travel to the vast desert. In short, when we feel bored in one environment, we need to shift our attention to another environment to adjust ourselves. This is the expression of human dynamics. The nomadic people's life of moving with water and grass is seen as the most interesting kind of life by city dwellers because they don't have a fixed home, and their living environment changes with their daily lives. This kind of life is something that non-nomadic people with fixed homes can only dream of. Curious Americans are always doing things they dream of. Because of the expression of human's active habits, they have whimsical ideas and build homes on a car supported by four wheels. As long as there is a road, no matter whether it is the northern country covered with ice and snow, the south with tall trees, the sparkling seashore, or the boundless desert, the home can be set up. Hand and Mouth Correspond Although this mobile home is only set up on a car, it does have two parts: a bedroom and a kitchen. In the bedroom, there are beds, tables, and chairs, everything that should be there. In the kitchen, there are cooking utensils, refrigerators, food cabinets, etc., nothing is missing. There are electrical equipments for lighting and heating. As long as there is a power supply at the location, it can be used very conveniently. The walls are made of light metal alloy plates, with plywood underneath. The windows are made of transparent, shatterproof glass. Although the outside climate is at the freezing point or boiling point, the indoor environment is unaffected. Although this house is about two hundred square feet, when folded up, including the furniture, it is only slightly more than two hundred cubic feet. Moreover, if fully set up, it only takes half an hour with the effort of two people. Although the nature of a mobile home is not much different from the "艒艒" boats commonly seen in the Jiangnan area, its complete equipment is naturally incomparable. This kind of mobile home is already quite popular in the coastal provinces of the United States. Shanghai is an eastern hub, and it is possible that in the near future, this kind of modern living product with the nature of a "艒艒" will be imported. Jealousy Yi Min Jealousy is an inevitable fact between men and women. For example, when two men fall in love with one woman, or two women fall in love with one man, in this situation, men and women on all sides will have some jealousy. Some jealousy expands. In the case of male heartbreak, because of strong resistance, duels easily occur. There are really many, many of these kinds of plays in Europe and America. However, in the case of female heartbreak, because of gentleness and kindness, they often commit suicide, such as jumping into rivers, hanging, taking poison... This is their most clever method of sacrifice and the best way to relieve mental pain. There are many, many examples to be found, both in China and abroad, and our country is even more unavoidable. I don't want to talk much about these things, nor can I bear to talk about them. These things inevitably contain some spicy meaning, and the extent of their cruelty can be imagined. However, I sincerely hope that this kind of thing will not happen between men and women. The victorious side certainly ascends to heaven, but the defeated side suffers enough. Therefore, I advise everyone not to try this taste, as it will definitely be more bitter than Coptis chinensis. Speaking of jealousy, it easily reminds me of a story recorded in the "Notes of the Censorate" about Ren Gui, the Duke of Guan of the Tang Dynasty. I am specially recording it to tell the readers: "Ren Gui, the Duke of Guan of the Tang Dynasty, was extremely afraid of his wife. Emperor Taizong gave him two concubines as a reward for his merits. Ren Gui bowed and thanked him but dared not take them home. Emperor Taizong summoned his wife, gave her wine, and said to her, 'A woman's jealousy is grounds for divorce in seven cases. If you can change your ways and not be jealous, then you won't drink this wine; if not, you can drink it.' She said, 'I cannot change my jealousy, please let me drink the wine!' So she drank it. When she returned home drunk, she and her family prepared for death together, but it was not poison. Since she did not die, Du Zhenglun teased Ren Gui one day, saying, 'There are three things a wife should be afraid of: when first married, she sits demurely like a Bodhisattva; who would not be afraid of a Bodhisattva? Then she gives birth to children, like raising a big tiger; who would not be afraid of a big tiger? When she gets old and wrinkled, she looks like a demon; who would not be afraid of a demon? So, why is it strange to be afraid of a wife!' Those who heard it were happy." It is said that Emperor Taizong of Tang gave Ren Gui's wife vinegar, not wine, so later generations extended this story, and any similar event between men and women is called "jealousy." Tracing back to the origin of the saying "jealousy," it comes from this. In this way, these two characters have a very long history, and of course, some people know that it is so, but do not know why it is so. Changing the Nest Luan Feng Written by Zhang Henshui Chapter Two Fragrant Grass Beauty, Rippling Waves Gently Support, Little Tower Bright Moon Night, Sweet Dreams First Warm Guoqi said: These two words are not my patent, I can use them, and others can use them. At this time, the maid in Ping Shan's house brought in a pot of hot water with a high-handled pottery pot. She smiled and said: Look, I am inviting you to taste tea. Regardless of whether it is particular or not, even the copper-tin pot is not used for boiling water. This water is not ordinary river water, it is the water from the Second Spring under Yuhuatai. This morning, I specially asked someone to carry two small buckets into the city. As she spoke, she took the pot and poured it into a gold melon-shaped pottery pot on the table, handed the water pot back to the maid, and then sat down, pressed the pot with her hand, and said to Guoqi: I am very happy today, so everything is done by myself. As she spoke, she poured most of a cup of tea into an octagonal pottery cup next to the teapot. The inside of this teacup was glazed with white porcelain, and when the tea was poured into it, it had a green color. A fine white smoke floated on the surface of the water, curling upwards. Guoqi smiled and said: The tea is really good, why are you so happy today? Ping Shan smiled and said: A bookstore in Shanghai used two of my paintings and paid me a hundred yuan. This is my proud work, and it was finally selected. The money is still in its decision, the bookstore owner is finally my confidant, so I am very happy. As he spoke, he sent the cup of tea to Guoqi, filled a cup for himself, raised it, and took a sip first. Guoqi said: I see that you are really happy, but I don't know what kind of painting you sold. Ping Shan said: Naturally, it is a fashionable beauty. Guoqi said: Do you painters draw fashionable beauties without any basis and just draw whatever you want? Or do you have a model like foreign painters painting people? Ping Shan said: Where can you find a model in China, and where can you find a model in Nanjing? However, paintings that are completely fantasized have no soul and can never be vivid. Guoqi smiled and said: Since the one you painted is your proud work, it naturally has a soul. But I don't know whose shadow you borrowed. Ping Shan smiled and said: Speaking of which, this is very interesting. In the alley in front of me, there is a female student. I often meet her when I go to the street. Guoqi was holding the cup ready to drink tea. Hearing this, he suddenly put down the cup and looked at Ping Shan and said: You also met a female student? Ping Shan said: I didn't meet her by chance, I often pass by her door, oh oh! Listening to the words, it seems like you want this kind of romance too. Guoqi said: If I have one, I don't need to hide it from you. If there is one, you use her as the basis for your books, and I use her as the basis for my articles, and there is nothing strange about it. Ping Shan said: This cannot be said like that. Using a person as the basis for a painting only seeks a silhouette in form. Using a person as the background for writing, then there must be a plot. If a man has a plot to write about a woman, then this is not a one-sided relationship. If you and I have the same romance, then I can only envy you. (24) Special Feature: A Tour of the London Chinese Art Exhibition Huang Jue Si, sent from Paris I have never studied our country's ancient art before. However, the Chinese Art Association in Paris initiated a trip to England, specifically to visit various art museums, especially the Chinese Art Exhibition, which has a rich collection (brought from China and other countries). Therefore, I was also motivated and gladly joined. Also, because I had seen it once during the domestic pre-exhibition, I only roughly observed the main points. Now, while the antiques are being transported back to the motherland, I will briefly write something to inform those who study our country's art and are concerned about this art exhibition. The London Chinese Art Exhibition was of course larger in "quantity" than the domestic pre-exhibition, more than three times as much. Especially bronzes, porcelains and sculptures. Now, for the convenience of writing, I will record each room separately. The first room displayed Shang artifacts and Han jade, mostly ancient wine vessels. There was also a bronze elephant collected by France, which was also displayed in this room and is worth noting. The exhibits in the second room were mostly collected by various countries. Such as various weapons, with gold and silver threads inlaid on the handles of the knives, exquisite and unparalleled. It is said to be very valuable. There were also pottery, bronze mirrors, plastic walls, and the British collection of brush washers, "ox" Han glass cups, etc., which are all top quality products in this room. The third room was decorated as a Chinese-style house, entitled "Mingyuan Hall," displaying imperial desks, etc. The statue of Emperor Taizong of Song was also hung high here. Ma Lin's "Dark Fragrance Floating," Li Gonglin's figures, and the "Four Joys Picture," which attracted much attention during the Shanghai pre-exhibition, were also displayed here. There were also many Tang paintings, which were beauty pictures. It is said that Tang women were mostly plump, so most of the paintings have oval faces, which is easy to identify the times. The fourth room displayed paintings by Emperor Huizong of Song, signed "The Only Man Under Heaven." I had not seen it carefully in China, but I unexpectedly discovered it in a foreign country, and I felt a different kind of emotion in my heart. Unfortunately, these blue-eyed people could not recognize these words. If they did, I wonder what their feelings would be like? The fifth room displayed Zhang Mo's sitting statues (wood carvings), two kinds, one collected by the UK and one brought from China. The two are similar, but I don't know who is genuine and who is counterfeit. Lady Guan's bamboo painting was also displayed here. This picture is a collection of New York, and the national treasures are all hidden in other countries. It is very regrettable! The Long River Ten Thousand Mile Map and the big and small rice paintings seen in China were all displayed here. The sixth room displayed Cui Zizhong's "Tongyin Bogu," Lu Ji's "Birds," Xu Daoning's "Carrying a Qin to Visit Friends," an anonymous Song Dynasty painting "Jiang Fen Shan Shui," and Lu Baoshan's landscape paintings, all of which made the viewers stop and linger. The seventh room displayed Qian Xuan's painting of "Insects," with several dragonflies, which is truly a supreme masterpiece. I saw Van Huysum's full of fruits and insects at the Wallace Collection Museum in England, and I can trace his "truth but still can't get his spirit." It is said that this painting is also collected by the United States, which is a great loss for our country. This room also displayed Song Ma Ben's "Hundred Goose Picture," with different postures and all vivid. It is truly a very rare work. The ancient artists of our country all put a lot of effort into sketching from life, so the works are all lively. The original work is collected by the Honolulu Museum of Art. Huang Gongwang's "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" was also displayed here. Outside of Xiao's paintings, there were also many kinds of porcelain, such as Chai Kiln, Ru Kiln, Guan Kiln, Ge Kiln, Ding Kiln, Jun Kiln, Longquan Kiln, Jian Kiln, and Linchuan Kiln, which were displayed separately in cabinets. (Foreigners especially appreciated Ding Kiln and Jun Kiln.) The eighth room displayed many Ming porcelain (in the Ming Dynasty, it was not called Kiln but porcelain, with names such as "Peacock Green," "Fahua Tricolor," and "White Ground Blue Flowers," etc.). The ninth room was the most luxuriously decorated and the largest room. The Qianlong Treasure Throne was also displayed in the center. In fact, this seat is not necessarily exquisite. Europeans admired him because he was an emperor and because of his literary and martial arts. Therefore, many white people wandered around and admired it. It is said that when the exhibits were selected in China, this seat was specially designated by the British. The European worship of heroes is something we should pay attention to with humility. There was also a red carved boat displayed in this room. The windows and doors of the boat could be opened and closed, and its function was equal to a hundred treasure chests. There were also many Qing porcelain, mostly colored animals, such as chickens, ducks, geese, sparrows, etc., with vivid postures. The tenth room displayed Jingtai Kiln and Yixing pottery, including a bamboo shoot, which was excellent, and various materials, with "two peeled eggs" being the most outstanding. It can directly be confused with real ones. The walls were hung with paintings by various masters of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, but not every painting in other rooms was covered with a specially made glass frame. My favorite Huang Shangu's book "Flower Qi Poetry" was also displayed there. The eleventh room displayed Guyuexuan porcelain and various openwork porcelain, which can be called exquisite. At the end was a large Salon, displaying a statue of Buddha from the Sui Dynasty, which was huge and unparalleled. When we visited the Royal Academy School in the basement the next day, we saw "large wooden pillars" placed straight in the room. When asked, we learned that they were used to support the large stone Buddha statue above, which shows how big it was. It is said that this was also collected by the United States and exhibited by the association. Of course, there are still such huge sculptures in China, but I don't know how they flowed abroad? Were they stolen? Or were they sold? I lingered for a long time and had infinite thoughts. This room also displayed a Gu presented to the King of England by Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, which was extremely exquisite. A statue of the Tang Dynasty tricolor Buddha was also displayed here. It is said that the tricolor Buddha is one of the eight Buddhas in Hebei Bafuwa, and there are three existing ones. One is owned by the British Museum, and one is in the United States. Overall, I observed the psychology of foreigners. Although some viewers came with curiosity; but most of them can be seen as scholars who are actually studying Eastern culture. Therefore, the atmosphere of the venue was very good, and the newspaper's tone was also very fair. According to the representatives Zheng and Tang, the British art exhibition has this grand occasion. Except for the Italian art exhibition that opened the year before, this one can be ranked second. However, Chinese art, "the present is not as good as the past" - the Ming and Qing Dynasties are not as good as the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and the Song and Yuan Dynasties are not as good as the Tang Dynasty, which has been the unanimous opinion of the venue. The reason is that ancient art mostly "wrote about objects," while the Ming and Qing Dynasties mostly relied on abstraction or imitated the ancients. Writing about objects means that every art has its life; works imitating the ancients only pick up the likeness of the ancients. After visiting the London Chinese Art Exhibition, I feel that this point is worthy of attention by modern researchers of art.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Rambling Talk There are so many problems in Europe! Xian Since Germany shouted for rearmament and tore up the Locarno Treaty, European countries have felt uneasy and frightened. France, in particular, has been deeply troubled. Therefore, they have been running around, advocating a collective security system to control Germany's military expansion. If this method is successful, European peace can be temporarily guaranteed. Unexpectedly, the Italian invasion of Abyssinia suddenly arose last September. To stop Italy, Britain and France must cooperate. However, France's conflict of interest with Italy is still shallow, while Britain's conflict of interest with Italy is deeper. Moreover, France wants to rely on Italy to control Germany, so it is inconvenient to over-harm Italy's feelings. Therefore, France is unwilling to work hard with Britain. Britain is inevitably very unhappy about this. Unexpectedly, the Italian-Abyssinian issue has not ended, and the German army suddenly entered the Rhineland. France was panicked, sleepless, and restless. France cannot independently sanction Germany without Britain's help. However, Britain believes that the Italian-Abyssinian issue is more important, while the issue of the German army entering the Rhineland is less important. Moreover, France is unwilling to put in much effort in the Italian-Abyssinian war. Britain is also inevitable to pretend to be stupid and unwilling to put in much effort for the German army entering the Rhineland. Therefore, France is inevitably unhappy about this. Therefore, these two issues cannot be resolved in the end. From the rise of these two issues, I have learned three lessons. One is that a country must rely on its own efforts to save itself. Relying solely on others for help will never achieve any results. One is that the means of vertical and horizontal alliances are useless. Unless there is the same conflict of interest between the two countries, it is possible. One is that if one's own strength is sufficient, any matter can be done hard without any scruples. Now that these two issues have passed, there are more and more issues that continue to arise. I don't know how it will be resolved next time. One is the issue of economic sanctions against Italy. Although Abyssinia has now been annexed by Italy, and the Italian parliament has approved the proposal to annex Abyssinia, and the Italian king will add the title of Emperor of Abyssinia, the League of Nations has decided that Italy is an aggressor country and has implemented economic sanctions. If Italy has annexed Abyssinia, it will immediately recognize the fait accompli and cancel the sanctions, which is somewhat unreasonable. If sanctions continue, there is fear that Italy will be pro-German or other problems will occur. This is an unresolved issue that needs to be resolved urgently. One is the issue of the reorganization of the Austrian cabinet. Germany has wanted to merge Austria for more than a day. Now that the goal of advancing troops to the Rhineland has been achieved, the second goal is to annex Austria. Now the Austrian cabinet has suddenly been reorganized. Prime Minister Schuschnigg has monopolized power. The pro-Italian Starhemberg has been removed from office. This matter is obviously a struggle between Britain, France, and Italy. In fact, the鹬蚌相争,渔翁得利 [when the snipe and clam grapple, the fisherman benefits], how can we know that this kind of dispute is not giving Hitler an excellent opportunity to take advantage of it. Although future problems are difficult to predict, this cannot but be considered a major problem in Europe's future. One is the issue of concluding the Mediterranean Pact. The British strongly opposed the Italian-Abyssinian war, one was because of the conflict of interest in Abyssinia, and the other was afraid of</p>

<h3>Rumors of a German-Japanese Alliance: Berlin Repeatedly Denies, But Britain Remains Suspicious</h3>
<p>(Paris) Renowned journalist Madame Tabouis recently published an article in *L'Œuvre*, briefly stating that London received news from Berlin last night stating that during a recent press conference held at the Foreign Ministry, Propaganda Minister Goebbels made an official statement: "Rumors of a mutual assistance agreement between Germany and Japan have been circulating abroad for some time. German newspapers have repeatedly denied them. It is no longer necessary to deny them again." Upon hearing this news, many British cabinet members were extremely uneasy, especially at the Foreign Office. They believe that the situation in the Far East is rapidly evolving, and that "Japan's southward policy is also seeking development in the Dutch East Indies." Their fearlessness is highly noteworthy.

<p>(Washington) According to the latest estimates from the Treasury Department, the total value of silver held by the United States is now only 20.7% of the total value of gold and silver reserves. A mid-January statistic indicated that silver accounted for 22% to 23% of the total value. This demonstrates that in recent months, the Treasury Department's silver purchase program has not only failed to make progress but has actually declined. As of May 14th, the value of silver reserves in the United States was $2,140,000,000, while the value of gold reserves was $10,222,000,000. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Italian Dispute Deepens: Eden Announces Source of Dum Dum Bullets, Accuses Italy of Fabricating Evidence, Italian Embassy Employed Liars to Frame: Members of British Parliament Express Outrage</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden today detailed in the House of Commons the Italian authorities' accusations that British firms supplied Dum Dum bullets to Abyssinia, and firmly denied these charges. The House of Commons was initially silent, but after the Foreign Secretary finished speaking, many expressed strong indignation. The Foreign Secretary admitted that several Italian soldiers may have been killed by Dum Dum bullets, but these bullets were left behind by hunting parties when they left the country as the war broke out and thus ended up in the hands of local tribes. They were not supplied by British firms. Since the beginning of the Italian-Abyssinian War, the British government has never issued an export license for these bullets. The Italian Embassy, based on fabricated information from a British-Polish man named Lobez, fabricated evidence to accuse British firms of supplying this type of bullet to Abyssinia. This man has a long history of disreputable behavior and uses multiple aliases. He forged a letter of introduction from the Egyptian Bank to the George Bart firm in Birmingham to obtain samples of the bullets, including 7.9mm soft-point hunting bullets. He then used a letter written hastily to the Abyssinian Embassy in London to prove that these bullets were made in Britain. He later changed his name and visited the Abyssinian Ambassador, offering to supply the Abyssinian government with large quantities of military equipment and ammunition in exchange for concessions. He requested the Ambassador to write a letter allowing him to purchase these items, listing a rather long list of goods, including two million rounds of soft-point bullets. According to the Ambassador, he did not grant this request. These documents have now been photographed and published in Italian newspapers. In fact, British firms never sold soft-point bullets. The British government has informed the Italian Embassy that employing such disreputable individuals cannot contribute to friendly relations between the two countries. The Italian government later withdrew its note to the League of Nations on this issue. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a lengthy statement in the House of Commons in response to Italy's accusations that Britain supplied Abyssinia with Dum Dum bullets. It is said that Abyssinia is rich in wild animals and is a well-known hunting ground. The so-called Dum Dum bullets may have been left over by Abyssinian warriors after hunting and were found by the Italian army. As for the bullets used by the Abyssinian army that were made in Britain, their source has been thoroughly investigated by the British authorities and a note has been submitted to the League of Nations proving that the Italian accusations are completely unfounded. Some of the bullets were manufactured more than twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Eden then detailed the course of events, stating briefly that the Italian Embassy had previously photographed and published in the newspapers on April 12th a soft-point bullet made in Britain, a letter from the Birmingham Basis Arms Factory to Dr. Martin, the Abyssinian ambassador to England on February 9th, and a package sent by the factory to the Abyssinian embassy, marked with the words "supplied to Abyssinia's military equipment," as evidence that Britain supplied Abyssinia with Dum Dum bullets. In fact, this matter was completely fabricated by Colonel Penbasis. A Mr. Luo, claiming to be a representative of Abyssinia, presented a forged letter of introduction from an Egyptian bank to visit the officials of the Basis Factory and purchase Dum Dum bullets. The factory officials told him that this type of bullet could not be used in civilized warfare. Mr. Luo then said that Abyssinia was full of leopards, which were extremely ferocious and could not be killed without Dum Dum bullets, and they were not for military use. After a long discussion, Mr. Basis, the managing director of the factory, agreed to provide samples, including thirty soft-point hunting bullets, packed in boxes of two each. Before sealing the boxes, Mr. Luo also asked the factory to provide a letter proving that the bullets were made in Britain. Later, claiming that the factory's draft letter was not good, Mr. Luo dictated another draft, stating that the Basis Factory certified that the bullet samples were indeed manufactured in Britain. This letter was packed in the same box as the samples, allowing Mr. Luo to take it away. There was no news of him until last month, when the letter dictated by Mr. Luo and the photos of the samples were published in Italian newspapers. The British government immediately conducted an investigation and learned that Mr. Luo was not sent by the Abyssinian Ambassador to England, and the Abyssinian Ambassador had never received the samples and letters. This Mr. Luo had also contacted other arms factories under different names regarding similar incidents, but he was unable to achieve his goals and left frustrated.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then said, "The purpose of this matter is to fabricate evidence to prove that British manufacturers supplied illegal weapons to the Abyssinian army. Its ulterior motives are self-evident. In order to protect the reputation of British industry and the government, I must take this unprecedented measure and fully announce the facts so that both at home and abroad can clearly understand the strictness of the British government's supervision of the quantity and type of exported military goods, to clarify the truth and dispel doubts." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Dum Dum bullet case, after Foreign Secretary Eden revealed the truth, the Italian Embassy seems to have been implicated. Several members of the British Parliament are now planning to request the government to investigate the truth in order to uncover the whole story. As for Colonel Lobez, the protagonist of this case, he is originally a British citizen. Although the British government cannot deport him, his anti-British activities can be prevented. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) After Foreign Secretary Eden made a declaration in the House of Commons yesterday revealing the truth about Italy's accusation that Britain supplied Abyssinia with Dum Dum bullets, the *Daily Express* reported that a certain member of the Italian Embassy in England was summoned back to Italy by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini.

<h3>British and French Cabinets Discuss Policy Towards Italy: Must Decide Before League of Nations Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The cabinet convened at Downing Street at 11:30 this morning to discuss the entirety of British foreign policy. The main points were the attitude to be adopted towards Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, the continuation of sanctions against Italy, the upcoming Anglo-Russian naval talks, and Germany's preliminary response to British inquiries regarding consolidating peace in Europe, etc. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) At the cabinet meeting this morning, Foreign Secretary Eden presented a report on the proceedings of the last League of Nations Council meeting and the discussions with French Prime Minister-designate Léon Blum in Paris. He said that based on the conversations, Britain and France could expect to cooperate closely in the future. In addition, Eden reported to cabinet members the results of the meeting between British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps and Adolf Hitler. It was reported that Hitler told Phipps that there were several points in the British agenda that were not very clear, and he proposed that Britain send a responsible cabinet member to Berlin to explain them. Regarding this matter, the Foreign Office believes that at this time, it is first necessary to exchange views with Germany through ordinary diplomatic channels. If sending a cabinet member to Germany is indeed beneficial, then the government should implement the previous proposal and send Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, to Berlin. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A diplomatic correspondent for *Le Matin* recently stated that the cabinet is now planning to quickly agree on a diplomatic policy, which should be decided before the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council (June 16th). Prime Minister Sarraut and acting Foreign Minister Pengu will meet with Prime Minister-designate Léon Blum to discuss policy towards Italy. The issues of the Locarno Pact and Austrian independence will also be raised with Italy before June 16th, requesting guarantees of unreserved cooperation with all relevant countries. However, there are several difficulties that are not easy to resolve. First, Italy has already stated that as long as the League of Nations' sanctions are not lifted, it will not participate in European affairs. Second, if the countries implementing sanctions insist on the current policy, the idea of a rapprochement between Italy and Germany may become a reality. Third, the British cabinet may not drastically change its current policy towards Italy before June 16th because it must consider domestic public opinion. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The chairman of the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen, the Spanish representative Madariaga, visited acting Foreign Minister Pengu this afternoon and stated that the governments of the relevant countries must actively discuss the issue of sanctions and decide on a final attitude before the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council on June 16th to avoid the Council repeatedly postponing the meeting until it is indefinitely delayed. Pengu replied that although the French cabinet is undergoing a change, it is still prepared to actively participate in this negotiation. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Newspapers are closely monitoring the evolution of Italian foreign policy. The *Manchester Guardian*, the organ of the Liberal Party, stated, "After Italy's great victory in Abyssinia, an impression has emerged on the German side, the depth of which is greater than it appears on the surface. The Germans believe that the National Socialist conception of war can be strongly supported by this." The newspaper then discussed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's imperialistic ambitions, stating, "Mussolini is said to want to develop his influence in Egypt, Arabia, and the Near East. Although Britain does not need to overreact to this, various difficulties may arise as a result. Therefore, whether Britain and Italy will continue to hold this position for a long time, or return to good relations, we certainly will not ignore it." (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3>Italian Army Expels Foreign Residents in Abyssinia: British Embassy Mail Lost En Route</h3>
<p>Djibouti: According to news from Dire Dawa today, British ambulance worker Bonner, who was bitten by a rabid dog and planned to go to Aden for treatment, was prevented by the Italian military authorities from taking the train to Djibouti and was subsequently arrested. It is feared that Bonner's life may be in danger due to this delay. At the same time, according to news from Addis Ababa, the Italian army has been arbitrarily entering foreign embassies to search for and arrest foreign residents. The British Embassy has maintained its dignity thanks to its Indian guard. The Italian army ordered the Indian soldiers to give the Fascist salute, but the Indian soldiers refused. The first batch of people expelled from Addis Ababa arrived here by train this morning, including four news reporters whom the Italian military authorities accused of "violating Italian military protocols": Steele, special correspondent for the *London Times*; Niben-Child, special correspondent for the Havas News Agency; the Greek Angelopoulos, special correspondent for the American Hearst newspapers; and Robillard, the French manager of the *Abyssinian Mail*. It is said that there are three hundred more Europeans who will be expelled and handed over to the British Consulate in Djibouti. A diplomatic pouch from the British Consulate was stolen en route on the train. The consul received a telegram instructing him to wait at the station to receive the pouch, but when the train arrived, the pouch was nowhere to be found. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

(Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian government previously withdrew its delegation because the League of Nations Council, disregarding Italy's opposition, still included the Italian-Abyssinian issue on the agenda, showing its determination not to cooperate with the League of Nations temporarily. The Italian representative to the League of Nations Opium Committee, Cavaglione, has also refused to participate in this session of the committee. (Havas, 18th)</p>
