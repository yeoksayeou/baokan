<p>時評</p>
<h3>英蘇海軍談話</h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>喧傳已久的英蘇海軍談話已於日前在倫敦開始了這决的談話是英國主動的據說其目的第一是在探詢蘇聯對於英美法三國海軍條的（卽三月二十五日在倫敦簽訂者）所抱的見解第二是依據去年六月問所締結之英德兩國量的海軍恊定而與蘇聯訂立同樣的恊定換句話說第一就是邀蘇聯參加以「建艦通知」和「質的限制」爲重心的三國海軍條的第二是使蘇聯的海軍接受那基於英德海軍協定的量的限制</p>
<p>英國之抱着這樣目標究竟是由於什麽原因呢原因的有下列幾點第一受了德國海軍擴張的威脅例如本月十七日德國艦隊表公布後第三天倫敦晨郵報評論說「德國艦隊表中有巡洋艦一艘潛水艇八艘爲外問前所未知此項巡洋艦載重一萬噸備砲口徑八英寸至於各潛水艇亦屬鉅型而能行駛大洋中者卽德國現有之驅逐艦十六艘亦何一不較英國海軍所置同類軍艦爲强大果爾則德國海軍艦隊殊足爲英國之勁敵矣」從這就可見其對德海軍恐懼心理的一般而英國聲稱德國之積極增强海軍完全是藉口蘇聯大海軍政策的刺激所以希望跟蘇聯訂立協定限制它海軍的擴展以免得德國競起造艦致超過去年英德協定中德國應佔英國的百分之三十五的規定第二對於蘇聯在波羅的海黑海及遠柬建設大海軍計畫的恐懼因爲蘇聯海軍的增强西方德國和東方日本的海軍競爭亦必激起這於英國固然不利而共直接對於英國在波羅的海愛琴海一帶勢力的削弱也屬顯然特別是蘇聯的友邦士耳其軍隊開入海峽不設防地帶後更給蘇聯的黑海門戶以一屏障更有一層在反蘇聯的根本意義上英國是决不願蘇聯的海軍强過德國的因此英國這决的邀請蘇聯談判多少是希望以協定來束縛其海軍的擴展</p>
<p>至於蘇聯對這决海軍談話所抱的態度可從最近蘇聯大使梅斯基向唐寗街提出的照會中明白看出據哈瓦斯十五日電「對於海軍軍備的任何量的或質的限制辦法凡爲德國所可接受者蘇聯無小準備參加共爲德國所拒絕者則蘇聯亦當保留拒絕之權此自應以歐洲海面爲限至於遠東方面蘇聯海軍軍備之增减當　日本軍備情形爲轉移」蘇聯因受日本和德國在東西兩方的威脅這種威脅自德日軍事同盟盛傳後益見嚴重所以必欲在波羅的海置有可拒德國海軍的艦隊在遠東置有可保護其海岸以防禦日本海軍　艦隊蘇聯海軍的增减顯將以德日海軍的增减而定在德日海軍競相擴充的情形下它縱　和英國簽訂了任何海軍協定實際上是未必會有什麽意義的</p>
<p>在英蘇談話開始之日英國又致牒美日决增加驅逐艦四萬噸這結果必將更引起各國的海軍競爭據國民十八日電日本且已擬以此要挾力爭世界最大的潛艇隊在這樣情形下英蘇海軍談話的結果也就可想而知了</p>

<h3>英下院辯論國防　應付未來事變　英發展軍需工業　促進全國生產效率　戰禍爆發有備無虞　國防調整大臣說明今後計劃</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會、討論國防問題當由國防事務調整大臣殷斯基浦爵士發表演說、爲政府所行政策作辯護、渠以國防大臣資格、在下院致辭猶爲第一决、演辭內容、對於國際時局並未特別提及、僅謂今後國際形勢變幻莫測、集體行動之制度、實可爲未來時局注入一種新因素、嗣又述及國防本題謂國防之充實與吾、既以戰事工業之興廢爲斷、故戰事工業當令準備就緒、俾得應付一切事變、最近四五年來、對於此節不無疏漏之處、現內閣務當設法予以補救、補救之道端在存儲彈藥軍械、「良以戰禍一旦爆發、卽欲擴充軍火產額、恐已噬臍莫及、以故現當促進牛產效率、俾一有警耗、卽可於二十四小時之內以全國各項工業悉行製造軍火、則其產額較之平時甚或增至二三倍之多、亦非不可能、庶幾可以適應新式戰爭之需要、而無虞掣肘也、關於軍火問題、曾向國內工廠九百餘家調査全國富源與生產情形、「現擬將積年缺點、儘在三四年之內彌補完全、余深信如能赴以毅力、必可克底於成」云云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>適應新式戰爭需要</p>
<p>（倫敦）統一國防事宜大員股斯基浦今日在下院提出辦公經費之預算案、並發表其就職後第一决之重要言論、其言已造成良好印象、</p>
<p>殷氏詳述其就職後九個星期內所担任工作之性質與範圍、其警關之語、爲「吾人必須備有一種生產能車、俾可在二十四小時之通告中移用此生產能力、以適應大規模新式戰爭之需要、蓋一旦風潮倐起、吾人未必能獲從容時間、以擴大吾人生產也、」</p>
<p>增進世界安全觀念</p>
<p>殷氏發言之初、首言反對黨與政府黨意見不同之點、謂反對黨以爲國家現所需作之準備、其中有兇兆之表示、而政府黨則覺英國國防計畫、不致使世界任何國家稍起恐慌、但可增進世界安全之最重要觀念、渠以政府黨之意見爲然、今之負責籌畫所必要之戰略者、其所遇之難題內有國防軍備須準備根據國聯盟的在或不及預料的環境中參加集體行爲之新因素、帝國國防委員會現檢討戰艦與艦隊天空軍備之問題、雖壯觀之計畫與博人稱讚之决議、固足動人、但渠不唯此是務、不過渠苟認爲必要、則任何重大决議、渠决不稍事退縮、</p>
<p>國防計劃科學研究</p>
<p>戰時食物之問題、涉及運輸儲藏分配與國內生產等細則今已組成委員會研究、畢夫利芝爵士已允任委員長、凡與食物供給有關之事項、皆須加以考慮、國務防事件重大、科學研究必不可少、故現徵求各大科學家之贊助、以發展國防計畫、原料工人與工業技術上能力、現皆已着手詳細調査、工廠之已經詳査者現有四百廠其已經初査者尙有五百廠、相當工廠悉已分類派員視察、列入表格分隸各機關、不獨製造砲彈等物之各廠、卽製造器具之各廠、亦皆載入分門別類之詳册中、渠希望在數月內可分配定單、向各廠定購必需諸品、而促進其生產力云、</p>
<p>擴張空軍增起三倍</p>
<p>殷氏繼續謂空軍增多三倍、需用飛機甚多、故有擴張飛機製造業之必要、現正設法羅致製造汽車者以便造成飛機出產之後備、已請其以政府費用添造新廠或擴大其廠基、其所得之酬勞爲經理費、其所添之廠屋將爲政府之產業、而由廠方管理維持之、政府將採行嚴峻方法以制止抬價貿利、政府並籌擬計畫以保護商船、而保護平民消極計畫、亦在籌擬中云、</p>
<p>邱吉爾主設軍火部</p>
<p>邱吉爾在辯論時發言甚多、謂供應機關領袖之職務、而與戰略上思想聯接、似係組織上之重大錯誤、試舉例以明之、殷斯基浦既須辦理類如在新改變的外交狀况中如何保持地中海中英國覇權、及蘇俄軍力如何與英國是吾不獨有天空轟擊、且有敵機載兵入境的危險等之難題、同時又須負責使國家有各種必要原料之充分供應、恐勢難兼顧、今日事態愈惡、距和平與安全觀念點相去愈遠、非一年前所可比、英國勢須經過長時期、方可變無備爲有備、而在此時期中歐洲恐將達於危險極度、故渠主張另立軍火部、召國內甚活潑靑年事業家相助辦理云、</p>
<p>邱吉爾又言及生產之速度與政府定單之優先權、殷斯基浦答稱、政府未有强迫權、邱吉爾鑒於外國政府之舉動、欲英政府效法、而將實業之一大部份置於戰時基礎之上、但英政府現所行者、一方面欲獲取成功結果、一方面不使尋常貿易受不適當之擾動、惟將來事勢或將使政府變其初衷、亦未可知云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>日德黷武如何預防</p>
<p>反對派自由黨領袖辛克萊爵士繼起發言、謂國際局勢充滿危險、其眞實情形、內閣當令人民週知洞曉、渠嗣乃攻擊意大利法西斯主義、略謂意大利已在近東軍略上佔有强固地位、其勢咄咄逼人、推厥原因、英國現政府軟弱無能、實有以致之、吾人試更放眼遠矚、則見遠東方面、日本軍閥勢力强大、向外擴展不遺餘力、近瞻肘腋之間、則德國方且迅速重整軍備、既無悔禍之心、亦有可慴之勢、凡此種種、吾人其何以防之乎」、</p>
<p>危機潛伏變本加厲</p>
<p>至是保守黨極端派領袖邱吉爾繼起發言、對於現政府所採國防政策激烈抨擊、而於國防調整部之組織、允表不滿謂「該部所負責任若是共大、而權限不足以副之」、又謂曠觀歐洲各國莫不競置軍備、全部工業均爲備戰之用、其範團之大、情形之緊張、殊足令人深抱悲觀、在遠柬方面、日本亦復整軍經武、舉國若狂、往年所潛伏之種種危險、均有復蘇之象、且又變本加厲、其故非他、卽英意兩國形成對峙、勢甚嚴重是也、邱吉爾結論、主張設立軍火部、而以整理政府與私營工業之關係爲其職責、幷要求政府將其所獲關於德國戰事工業「大規模牛產情形」之悄息報吿國民、咸使了解云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）阿比西尼亞總督巴杜格略上將、自任所啟程返國、已於本日午刻飛抵意屬伊利特里之阿斯瑪拉城、渠返京後、當由國王兼阿比西尼亞皇帝愛麥虞限三世暨首相墨索里尼、先後延見、加以褒獎、外傳上將奉命返國、係爲擘劃國防大計、俾克應付未來歐洲戰局、負資方面頃對此說明自加以吾認、謂係無稽之談、並謂上將年已六十有五、此决統率師干、轉戰異域歷時五月、頗覺困頓、加以阿比西尼亞氣候惡劣、體氣微感不適、自須返國休養、一俟抵達羅馬之後、卽須轉赴離京八十公里之費烏奇溫泉小作羅桓、至下月七日、卽意大利統一紀念之期、則仍返此、參加盛大閱兵典禮、至於征阿慶功之宴、則當在統一紀念日後、定期舉行云、據一般人所悉、官方雖作如是聲明、但巴杜格略上將原爲參謀部長、此决返國、對於國防計劃、必將從新加以研究云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>韓復榘孔祥榕　視察黃河尾閭　韓孔商定治黃計劃　裁灣挖泥以暢河流</h3>
<p>濟南通訊、黃河爲患、已有悠久歷史、至近年更益加甚、國力民力、因而損失者、難以數計、黃河水利委員會委員長孔祥榕、以河身淤沙、與年俱高、尾閭阻塞、宜洩不暢、不速爲根本之計、未來大禍、必有更勝於今日者、而省府主席韓復榘、亦同俱此觀感、是以約定同作黃河海口實地視察、藉以　商疏導宣暢辦法、以利水流、而免决口、計自本月十七日首途、二十日夜十二點歸濟、往返四日、記者因亦隨行、復窺黃河尾閭之全豹、用述其經過情形於後、</p>
<p>沿河視防計劃分流</p>
<p>孔祥榕韓復榘等一行於十七日午刻、由濟乘汽車一同出發、隨行有黃河水利委員會主任工程師安立森林·工程師張度·吳南凱·河防組主任劉秉忠·山東省政府顧問過之綱·張聯陞·第二科科長劉昭綱·河務局工程科長潘鎰芬·並手槍旅衛兵一隊、當先至洛口、沿黃河南岸大堤前進、一路視察河工、詢問防務、過樣子壩時、孔韓商談治黃事、大體主張相合、韓以爲黃河河身、高於平地、實爲天然水塔、　不知利用、反成大患、擬設法挖通黃河兩岸之河流、建設閘壩、以便開閘放水、非特可永减水患、且可利用灌田、將來擬先在利津一帶、試驗設閘放水田辦法、孔謂擬使黃水在香山分流入徒駭河、其目的與此相同、前經擬定計劃、呈送經委會、尙未獲批復、深盼此事可以成功、需欵雖多、倘利用兵工、亦可省大半、韓深韙其言、孔又謂關於黃河治本辦法、當晚、到達利津縣境閻家河工汎部停宿、第一路民團指揮趙明遠·縣長黃醒言等、均由縣城內渡河來南岸謁見、孔韓並協商出發事宜、蓋趙氏曾數度趕上海口、該處情形、甚爲熟悉也、</p>
<p>冒雨出發順流而下</p>
<p>十八日早三時、忽雷雨交加、　四小時始漸息、是時、第一路民團指揮趙明遠、已　汽車站準備出發事宜、共備妥指揮部所有大船三隻、民船四隻、以備乘坐、另帶小船九隻、以備途中水淺時更換、孔韓起床進早點後、已九時許、雨止、但陰雲仍厚、滴滴欲墮、且西北風作、寒冷頗甚、隨行人員、多未携禦寒衣物、頗感困難、但仍登船冒雨、衝寒而進、趙明遠亦同行、韓與張過兩顧問、共乘一船、孔與記者等共乘一船、趙與潘劉兩科長共乘一船、其餘韓之衛兵及趙之民團一部、所乘坐船隻、均爲裝貨之船、上下艙均甚狹、加以風勢不順、舟行甚緩、至下午四時、始行四十里、抵亂荊子合龍處、該地已到黃河之最下游、不屬山東河務局所管轄、蓋河務局第三總段至寗海爲止、寗海以下、即不設河務局矣、</p>
<p>黃河分流南北兩股</p>
<p>此地爲黃河分流之處、距海口約一百四十里、自閻家至此四十里、共一百八十里、其正流原由此向東北流、經陡崖頭、再分兩股入海、民國二十年東北之河道、忽行淤塞、遂改道向東南流、沿淸水溝·過丘家荘·申樹坡·徐家屋等處、至太平灣（即東燭泥）入海、至民國二十四年東南之河道、又宣洩不暢、黃水大股、復向東北决流、仍走陡崖頭故道、分兩股入海、蓋因亂荊子以下向東南流之轉灣處、坐有淤灘一處、致水流東南之股、須由此先向西南流、而後轉無趨東南、因此、東北一股流量最大、佔全河十分之六七、而東南一股、不過十分之三四而已、此外尙有數小股、向東流入海、則無從細考、在亂荊子合龍處以東、有積水一片、二十三年、曾向北决一小口、二十四年五月、經趙明遠將其堵合、保護墾區、並沿此岸築有長堤一道、聞在二十四年秋間、又决一次、旋復堵合、合龍處現有小屋數間、均係楷箔加泥而成、作臨時小生意、供給船戶預備大水一至、即棄之而去、故不作久遠計也、</p>

<p>寸草皆無人烟盡渺</p>
<p>兩旁之地、寸草皆無、亦無人烟、且無地名、惟兩旁皆有濕地、則因海潮升時、迎阻黃水下流而漲、海潮退後、仍露出濕地也、在此極目東視、白帆羅列、隱約可見、海口蓋已在望、更前進、海岸船帆、益爲明顯、河之兩岸、仍鼓棹猛進、比至海口附近、已八時一刻、小火輪已候於海外示燈嗚號、船上民團、以號語呼其進口、因水小不果、各船亦因夜深、不便外出、當即下錨停宿、惟趙及張過兩顧問、連夜駕小舟再趕往海口外登小火輪、即住於輪上、其餘人等、均停泊海口、二十日早五時、孔韓相繼起身、極目四望、一片汪洋、僅水中有淤灘處可見、蓋黃河由此入海、已成爲漫流、無河道之可尋、其寬度不可以數計、按此股不過十分之三四、即如此浩瀚、其十分之六、由陡崖頭入海、當更甚於此、黃河之大、於此可見、無怪每年决口、輒成大患也、</p>

<p>聞一槍聲</p>

<h3>棉布走銷猶難暢達　組細廠布去路尙旺</h3>

<h3>晴雨無常麥價見升降　—海外麥產之形勢—</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份呈先俏後跌之象、因上午天雨甚狂、人心一致轉昂、各月份喊價、較之前日、均好起三四分、入後則因日出雲霽、氣候又佳、故拋戶又轉優勢、出碼一旺、各月份遂反跌二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、初以粉市開價即軟、各月份即猛落三五六分、迨至二盤、則又因粉市回起、補空甚盛、各月份復回好三五分、目下新買賣、遂步開展、惟市面上落、則亦趨混亂、蓋新貨未經上塲、多空均屬投機、無事實可　推求也、現礬土因無到貨、廠胃亦未動、又無見交云、</p>

<h3>日本女子的能耐</h3>
<p>— 李宗文</p>
<p>—遊日觀感之一</p>
<p>在國內，看慣了新舊女子的消極態度，一到日本，看到日本女子，在社會上的重要地位，就特別引起了我的注意，就特別引起了我的注意。</p>
<p>同行的團體中有一位美國婦人，我問她對於日本女子的感想如何，她很幽默的告訴我：</p>
<p>「日本女子的手比中國女子特別粗大。」</p>
<p>我覺得這句話極有意義　因為，有粗大的手的不只是屬於貧苦的日本婦人，中等階級，甚至閨閣名媛，也都有一雙偉大的粗笨的手。細緻的，如羊脂一般，玉琢一樣的，典型的，美麗的，但不管事的手，却不易在日本看見。</p>
<p>因為有這一雙偉大的粗笨的手，於是在日本所有的各種商店裏，大的小的，新的舊的，都有日本女子在那裏活動着，旅館裏，戲院裏，汽車中，電車上，也都是日本女子在那裏執行職務，耳所聞，是日本女子淸脆的聲音「請進」，「請買些」，「多謝光顧，」目所見，是日本女子勤勞的服務，用腦力的，用勞力的，什麼都有，她們的服裝很大方，她們的態度極端莊，她們的性情尤溫和，社會對她們的觀感也很正當，並沒有什麼低級走味的念頭兒在暗地裏作祟。她們自己認為服務社會是她們的天職，勞動是應有的分兒，而並不是低賤的事，只會消費而不事勞動的女人才覺得可恥呢！</p>
<p>在京都我看見京都市長的侄女兒在物丸大商塲的食堂內當侍者，她侍候顧客有禮而溫順，毫無蹻矜的模樣。</p>
<p>當我走過了日本的八大都市，看見每處都是相仿似的現象，於是我發生了下面幾個感想：</p>
<p>「日本女子在職業界的地位是根深蒂固了；換句話說，日本事業界已少不了女人；」</p>
<p>「日本事業界如果發生突變，男子立刻退出而從事付突變，則女子在能力上足够立卽代替男子維持並發展原有事業；」</p>
<p>「靑年女子在職業界服務，老婦人在家庭裏管家，小女孩往學校裏念書，於是，壯年人就可當兵，移民國外，發展對外貿易，開拓「帝國」疆土，國勢就更容易得到進步了。」</p>
<p>「使男子可以內顧無憂，而安心向外發展的，女子確是其原動力！」</p>
<p>在國內時，我聽見人家說，世上有三寶，就是洋房，中菜，日本女人。據他們的意思說，以男子的自私心為出發點，無非因為日本女子順柔非常，朝請安，晚問好，出叩頭，入跪迎，做丈夫的好像是大皇帝，不可一世，於是說日本女人眞是人間寶物　這話太沒有意思了，日本女人之所以能够目為寶貴者，據我的意思，應該歸功於她們的能耐，歸功於她們一雙偉大而粗笨的手！</p>
<p>諸位女讀者們倘使不信作者的話，就請舉起你們的纖纖玉手，再低頭想一想：</p>
<p>「假使中國發生突變，男子都須退出事業界，你們能够立刻站起來，替男子們維持並發展原有事業否？」</p>
<p>這是非同小可的一件事　！</p>
<p>這個年頭兒，又是正當所謂「非常時期」，願大家多多吟味我這幾句話！</p>
<p>「好偉大的一雙粗笨的手！」我不禁再三感嘆！</p>
<h3>烟台的婦女</h3>
<p>— 意德</p>
<p>烟臺亦名芝罘，位於山東半島的北岸是我國北方的門戶。因為地居幽僻，交通不甚便利，所以烟臺的社會狀况還是很閉塞的。但從五四運動以來，上海·天津·北平等地的婦女很有未到烟臺的，所以從外表看來，烟臺的婦女新舊懸殊得的確可怕！剪髪，穿旗袍長馬夾，着高跟皮鞋的，是烟臺的婦女帶頭巾，紥褲脚管，着三寸繡花鞋的，也是烟臺的婦女；而且思想方面也很懸殊，現在姑就我所知道的烟臺婦女的狀况，約略的寫一些。</p>
<p>現代以男性為中心的社會，婦女的地位當然是非常卑下的。烟臺社會也是拿男性做中心，伊們的地位當然也不能越出數千年來男權之下，重男輕女的習慣，還根深蒂固地種在烟臺一般人的腦子裏。伊們的家庭不但有重男輕女之分，而且長嚴幼卑之別，也很嚴的。做媳婦的在家庭裏，一方面果是丈夫的奴隸，一方面又是翁姑的牛馬。伊們早晚侍候了丈夫翁姑的起居飮食，一不滿意，還要受許多咒駡；終天順從了丈夫翁姑的差遣指揮，一不周到，還要受到許多斥責，這都是極平常的事。此外還有最惡劣的待遇莫過於童養媳了。烟臺人很少畜　環的惡習，確是他們的好處；但童養媳却兼做了兩個人的差使了。伊們的家庭裏過了這非人生活，在社會上的地位是可想而知的了！大家都認女子是男子的附屬品，除了資產階級，夫榮子貴，或自身極能幹的貴婦人，稍能得到社會的恭維外，大部份婦女在社會上沒有一些地位的，社會上的舊勢力還是支配着一切，舊禮敎的威嚴還要不可侵犯的。</p>
<p>講到伊們的職業呢，實在幼稚極了。資產階級的婦女呢，不用說，她們擁有丈夫的資財，生活極豐厚，環境極安樂，職業是伊們不需要的。在家庭裏過那很享福的生活，就是伊們終身的職業了！中產階級的婦女呢，也差不多，不過沒有有錢人家來得寫意。縫飪洒掃，撫育子女，以及一切家庭，多是伊們自己來做，甚有從事於學校敎育的，那是鳳毛麟角，極少數的。至於無產階級的婦女呢，那才是社會的生利者。伊們日間到髪網工廠去作工，晚間到平民學校去念書，除了縫飪洒掃，撫育子女外，還要自食其力，天天到工廠裏去做工，不但自己要維持自己的生活，有時還要來養育子女，甚至要養活丈夫！然而，因為伊們缺乏知識，祗知服從廠主，不知改良自己的待遇，一任資本家的蹂躪！所以伊們的工作是很苦的，工資是很少的。我希望從事於婦女運動的人們，起來提高伊們的地位，增進伊們的福利。</p>
<h3>俄國現階叚的女性</h3>
<p>— 陳揆英</p>
<p>俄國婦女們的國家觀念，比較他國特殊熱烈。所以伊們對於所選定的事業的「試煉」，奮猛地繼續着精進。因此伊們所獲得的範圍和男子同等的廣大，遙勝於歐美各國的婦人們。</p>
<p>關於蘇維埃的職業界，因把一切男女的性別廢止，如果伊們希望為洋服裁縫師或鑄造師甚至連海陸軍人也可以的。現在一切工塲中，勞動的職工，男女的數目也大概相同。而職務上，精密的和科學的較男子顯示着有上上的能率。</p>
<p>現在俄國全國有五萬飛行家和航空機關士及二百五十萬餘的化學國防聯盟會員，其中最飛躍的是陸軍部長威洛斯弗所創設的莫斯科婦人航空隊中以雄勇的妙齡婦女所組織的「靑年團」。伊們把關髪刈短而服裝也和男軍人一樣。陸軍部長對於伊們作事的敏捷和勇敢，他很得意的曾說過：伊們落下傘的修煉，比投爆彈的技術還優秀。」</p>
<p>還有像技術家，企業家等在他國幾乎完全是男子所占有，可是在俄國呢，則連社長的重任的椅子，也有女性占據的，其活動也不亞於男子。</p>
<p>照上面的事實看起來，俄國婦女因為懷抱着未來的希望，伊們無論怎樣奮發地忍耐地鬥爭的生活，也願意去做。</p>
<h3>俄國女機關槍　共有四十六萬</h3>
<h3>有十五年奮鬥歷史之近東一女英雄</h3>
<p>— 食</p>
<p>（海外婦運通信第三號）</p>
<p>年來女權運動以及婦女解放之聲。充塞於五大洋之間。但論收效之宏。實當首數土耳其女英雄胡艾迪Corporal　Holide　Edib氏十五年來之勇猛奮鬥。胡艾迪之先世。系出穆罕默敎主守陵之聖裔。胡年十六。卽被選入蘇丹之宮為妃媵。從此禁闥Harem深鎖。此生本已不能更與宮外通往還。幸而土國偉人全美莫大寶帥Mustafa　KEMAL　Pasha先於一九二〇年。召集國民大會而宣言廢黜蘇丹。胡艾迪計出多端。先已與宮外暗通消息。嗣則復於前此十五年之一九二一年某夜。化裝兵士。潛逃出宮。數年之間。歷經戰陣。直至一九二三年十月宣吿民主政體土耳其完全獨立之日為止。胡乃得以女子在土軍中擢升軍弁。而開亘古未有之創例。並與莫大寶帥並轡入堅埠Canstantinople。以膺人生罕遇之殊榮。胡為才美兼善之女子。其在國內主持一切革新運動。成績斐然。聲聞至遠。雖土耳其之國情。絕不容與我東方古文明一統之中華。遽爾相提並論。然如放宮女。去面罩。以及關乎女選舉權等運動。胡氏行之。無不應手成功。其人實以女英雄而兼造時代之婦運先覺。最近胡且以元首夫人資格。前往英國。出席大學演講會。為其神國。力任對外宣傳云。</p>
<h3>世界各地婦女的動態（下）</h3>
<p>— 維經</p>
<p>伊朗少女留學歐洲</p>
<p>伊朗（卽前波斯），雖是一個古國，但文化是很落伍的，更其是女子敎育，素被漠視。在從前，雖也偶有少數貴族婦女，往歐留學，但郤只限於英國，而且也很少有入專門以上的學校肄業的。普通在英國讀畢中學課程。已可回國而稱受過高等敎育的了。但是在這三四年中，情形已是大變。往歐留學的婦女，非但已打破了歷年的紀錄，而且平均每年往歐留學的數目，已比三四年前，增加了四倍至五倍。留學的所在，也不只限於英國。法，比，奧，波，瑞士等，都有。其中有二位留法研究音樂的，頗負時譽。在比學習法律的一位，據說，也極有希望。此輩婦女，頗多來自中等家庭的。伊們留學國外，大率均得有政府的資助。從此可見在這古老的國家中的婦女，也逐漸地趨向於解放之途了。</p>
<h3>女子有了承繼權以後擇偶者的視線</h3>
<p>德國的婦女勞動營</p>
<p>德國，自從希特拉執政之後，到處都可聽到「婦女回進家庭的口號，婦女運動在德國，似乎已受了一個致命的打擊。其實不然。回進家庭的，大率都是三十歲以上及已婚的婦女。三十歲以下，至十六歲之間的求婚的婦女，都得分批的受勞役的訓練。訓練的方法，在目前，暫定為三期，每期半年。在訓練時期中，都得暫時離開家庭或學校，而宿在勞動營中，幾乎完全過的是士兵的生活。但每天除着受戰時服務的訓練外，還得各就其性之所近，而務服。如築路，浚河，運輸，電業，以及扶助鄰近的農婦，處理家務，撫育嬰孩，管理牲畜，農塲，等等。在第一第二期中，是毫無報酬的。在第三期中，每星期，可得六十芬尼的津貼。若是訓練完結，成績優良，而願繼續服役的，每星期可得一馬克又八十芬尼，所以德國的婦女，在將來，或許可和蘇俄的婦女，並架齊軀。</p>
<h3>孟河婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 沉良</p>
<p>孟河這地方，在常州丹陽兩縣的中間，雖有一座三里週的小城堡，亦已頹敗成土阜了。是江南窮鄕僻壤，大部份男子都在上海，蘇，錫，湖州一帶謀生，所以孟河的婦女是須要担任全部的家政和田事，比較浙江內地婦女不下田的生活，要苦得多了。</p>
<p>春天，麥田正在靑苗時期，沒有工作，便在家裏結麻，預備着夏季的衣服和蚊帳料，其實大多是賣掉或作當舖。有的紡棉花，一天總要紡好幾把棉條，沒棉花的人家請鄰居紡，掙幾個工錢。直到淸明時節，伊們要　始耘麥田了，去草鬆泥。接着便下黃豆種子。</p>
<p>到初夏，伊們工作已緊漲，飭兒女們磨鐮刀下田割麥，麥割在田裏，又恐防被雨落濕發芽，故必連夜挑到家門前場上堆起，孟河婦女個個都會挑擔，一二百斤重壓在肩頭，走得飛快，又善於推獨輪小車，等麥子打下了，把麥柴裝車推往街鎭去賣，不會算盤不識字，而賬却不會算錯。伊們再買了荳餅推回來，餵猪和肥秧田。</p>
<p>麥沒割盡的時候，又得做秧田了。浸稻子，車水。伊們善於車水，整天整夜與男子一樣。孩子和小姑娘亦輪流帮着車。來不及時就請忙工，於是又得燒茶煮飯供給服侍。有嬰兒的更得照顧嬰兒。同時荳田裏又須削荳草了，猪要吃，羊要吃……孟河的婦女在忙季裏連洗臉都沒工夫的，頭髪像鴉窠，紥一塊靑布手巾，褲脚管捲得很高，（這可不能同都市小姐的露腿比了，）整天踏在汚泥裏。</p>
<p>等到拔了秧，栽了秧，天旱車水，雨水多又得往外車。而黃豆已老，須在毒烈的陽光下，不怕荳葉上的刺毛蟲，下田拔豆，拔了再鞭。統是伊們雙手的工作。直到割了稻，再種了麥，伊們始得的一點休息。可是眞能休息嗎？為出門的丈夫做鞋子，為自己的兒女縫補寒衣，收租的來了，催糧的又來了。丈夫沒錢帶回家，全仗伊們的去應付呵，近幾年孟河亦閙荒，孟河婦女雖有銅皮鐵骨，亦應付不下了。</p>
<h3>致留在日本奈良的汾姊</h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>汾姊：</p>
<p>七年不回祖國，在神戶登輪時，雖然和琦，種英等—還有你，不免有些戀戀惜別之意；但一想到此去將重見祖國的河山，重親祖國的服食，心上便覺得無限的高興，以致當你們眼圈紅紅地站在碼頭上揮着你們的白巾時，我竟不能為你們灑一滴別淚了。</p>
<p>我在船上是無時無刻的不在懸想祖國的一切，恨不能把船上的同胞一起召集攏來，請他們各自給我一些報告，不管使我高興的也好，使我不歡的也好，只要多少說給我知道些。但是失望得很，祗向兩位略略一探問，便使我沒有勇氣再打聽了；他們雖是只說了寥寥的三四句，但從言語中所表現的那重深灰色已儘够引起我的焦慮和傷感。</p>
<p>到上海，在大姊家留了三天（今天是第四天了），眼裏所見到的，耳朶裏所聽到的，眞够使一個熱血的人變成冷血，有氣的人變成無氣。祗就我們婦女方面講，不論精神上，形式上，沒一處不和日本婦女截然相反；我莫不明白便宜的日本貨大家都知道要買，為什麼日本人的優美的性情，却誰也不屑學呢！</p>
<p>前天，大姊帶我們上這裏租界當局所辦理的兆豐公園去，這一去簡直是百感交集，旁的可以一槪不說，單說兩位女太太：一位是穿着得十足摩登化的少奶奶，有着穿西裝的丈夫，和一個也是混身西裝打扮的小孩子。當伊一路在走的時候，儘用流利的英語指揮着伊的孩子，那孩十是否懂得，我可不知道；但旁邊的人却的確是羨慕伊極了，伊自己也的確得意極了。我想這樣好的「家庭亡國敎育」，別說在日本，就是在其他各國，或許也不易找到吧？</p>
<p>還有一位也是很摩登的少奶奶，也有一個孩子，一個混身髒得不堪的孩子，又且很瘦弱，所以走路很遲；但他的母親却不管他，拖着他的小手狠命的儘走，孩子哭了，伊還是不聽得，依舊很起勁地和伊的同伴說話。</p>
<p>我不知道對於這種現象該發些什麼議論，但願內地的情形，並不如此！</p>
<p>抱歉得很，我第一封信便送給了你這樣一盆冰的冷水！再會！祝你　進步！　妹雪上</p>

<p>慈幼事業在歐美諸國，大都非常重視，認為社會敎育中最重要的事業之一。不論那一國，免不了貧苦災亂的困厄，在貧苦階級裏面，更免不了孤苦零丁的兒童，人世間最慘痛的人，也莫過於這些孩子了。你想：父母窮得衣服不周，貧兒那裏去找生活？有的父母都死亡了，孤兒那裏去找生路？講到受敎育與職業的洗禮，當然一輩子也說不上了。他們一綫生機，全看政府有沒有慈幼的設施？社會能不能予以援助？這在文明各國，已經辦理得很完善，在我們「慈幼」兩個字，差不多的人，還不曾理解，慈幼的工作，充其量只可以說在萌芽。最近熊希齡先生的女公子——熊芷女士，考察歐美兒童敎育及慈幼事業，剛回國的第三天，便和我談了一番歐美之行的印象。</p>
<p>熊女士從前留美時是研究敎育的，在哥侖比亞大學及巴拿大學，還得了師範研究院的碩士學位，一九二七年回國，就在北平她父親手創的香山慈幼院，跟她母親熊朱其　夫人辦理慈幼敎育，算來有九年的歷史，她覺得很有興趣，所以全副精神都用在慈幼院千百個苫兒身上。他說：「從前沒有到歐洲去，此番請了長假，到歐陸各國巡禮一次，興致很好。去年九月放洋，費了八個月的時光，歷經意·俄·德·英·法·繞道美國而返。考察各國的托兒所·嬰兒園·幼稚園的組織，敎養訓練人員的方法，並代表中華慈幼恊會，注意各國的慈幼事業。」</p>
<p>我問她辦理慈幼事業，那一國算得最發達？她說：「講到兒童享受科學敎養的幸福，以蘇聯為最普遍。空間他們的社會制度不同，一切大工業全歸國營，所以工讀敎育辦得十分完善。每個工業區，附近都設托兒所，嬰兒園，幼稚園，小學，工人的子女，從小都受科學化的敎養，還有俱樂部，兒童可以任意游戲，技擊，娛樂，學習各種工藝；即是農村集團裏，也有孩車往來，不離開母親的喂養；有這樣好的環境，兒童還怕流浪失學麼？敎養兒童方法的研究精神，以美英為最，德意也不差。各國對此都由民間辦理，或受政府津貼，予以指導及監督，自然不會辦不好的。」</p>
<p>談，談，又談到婦女身上來，問她對於各國婦女的印象，她告訴我：希特勒雖然喊過「女子回到家庭去」的口號，但德國婦女照樣為社會服務，並非全體向後轉。歐美婦女職業與我國情形不同，在我國服務社會與主持家政，分為兩件事，這種走極端的見解是錯誤的，像他們一面做社會工作，一面兼顧家政，雙方並行不悖。譬如白天在外做事，公事房回來，照樣操作家政，不像我國婦女，以為在外做事，就不顧家政了；有些在餐不做，在家也不做，這還成什麼樣兒？俄國的男女，是同樣勞動的，婦女白天做工，把小孩寄在托兒所，晚上仍抱着回家敎養。就是德意英美的女人也相仿，她們以為男人要有職業，女人也要有職業；經濟獨立，是不分男女的，如果一個女人，沒有職業，經濟不獨立，是羞恥，是沒出息的，這種觀念，便和我們截然不同了。</p>
<p>依女士所見，歐美婦女有幾點値得我國婦女效法的？我說之後，熊女士哈哈地笑了，她說：「這問題不便答覆，中國婦女也很多賢明的，怎可一筆抹煞呢！」我說這例沒有關係，我們的態度，是取長補短，別人有長處，正是我們的敎訓，於是她就說出以下的數端：</p>
<p>歐美婦女的體格很强壯，生活有規律，衛生方面，比我們講究。</p>
<p>她們敎養兒女很認眞，初做母親的人，往往參考許多書籍，研究科學方法來敎導兒女，不輕易假手他人的。</p>
<p>她們治家，能引用科學化的方法，不用婢僕，親自操作，有條不紊。</p>
<p>對社會服務精神，値得佩服，很多婦女，為慈幼及公益事業盡義務，整天工作，不受酬報，眞是難能可貴。</p>
<p>富求知慾，巳出校門的婦女，依然讀書看報，力求進步。</p>
<p>最後她下個結論：另多數女人，還是寄生蟲！經濟不獨立，學問不長進；服務欠眞實；解放！解放！不過是濫調，要求男女平等，怎能澈底的成功？</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>猪肉漲價</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>猪肉漲價了！</p>
<p>不久以前，荳腐已經公佈漲價了，這影饗到一般小百姓的牛活是很大的。現在猪肉又漲價了，雖然猪肉比之荳腐是跟一般平民的生活關係沒有那麽密切，但是最少這樣一來，窮人吃肉的機會也越發越發地减少。本來便沒福享受的，，過着下等動物一般的牛活的小百姓沒辦法再吃肉還是小事，但影響至整個「市面」，却又不能不認爲是一種不良現象的。何况漲價的原因牽涉頗大。</p>
<p>猪肉漲價是最近鮮肉業公會議决公佈修正去年五月三十日所訂舊價目的。每種每斤酌增價四分至七分。然而，這通過的新價目只能及於成本，如無下脚猪油猪頭等雜碎貼補，是還得賠本的。本來本埠出售鮮肉店舖是有二千九百四十餘家，現據調査已不及二千五百家，可知道一行業最近凋零的情形。而這一行業雖然對於一般小百姓已屬浪費，（原因是買不起。）但究竟仍爲日常生活主要品之一，是不能一日或缺的，如最近美國屠夫罷市引起恐慌便是很好證明。現在，連這日常生活必要品之一的鮮肉業亦如斯冷落，經濟前途的可怕，是可想而知了。</p>
<p>此决猪肉漲價的原因，大的可以分兩部份叙述。第一是爲了來源斷絕，所以求過於供，不得不漲價。本埠的猪肉是來源自通州，如臯，泰與三地，而現在又因爲農村破產，作爲副業的養猪，在農民已無法維生時當然不能再豢養。而且去年又遭受大水，環境越趨惡劣，養猪者甚至連母猪也賣了來維持生活。所以來源已不能供給本埠每日的需二千頭以上的猪了。這一個原因，是牽涉及了整個農討的破產，和一切天災人禍的破壊的，這一切又制限於國家民族的整個不能超脫於帝國主義鐵蹄下。</p>
<p>第二個原因是捐稅重重。普通一頭猪除了猪價十六元（百斤算）運費三元，又得兩個租界的稅捐，和政府的屠宰稅三角九分，衛生檢騐一角，宰牲費一角等等，成本已是二十元左右，而一頭一百斤毛肉的猪，去頭去毛後只得五十斤多一點，成本已貴，更小得不增價。這一切雖然不算得上是苛雜，但已足使一般商人受累不淺，使一般商業要走入不可救的道路的。</p>
<p>上述兩原因是置猪肉這一行業於死地的，但對於其他各行業又不是一樣嗎？而且日常生活必要品的荳腐，猪肉也漲價，共他一切更何堪設想！</p>
<h3>出族（續）</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>吃過了早飯，是姓方的人都漸漸地往祠堂裏走去，彷彿淸明時節「啃甲魚骨頭」（註）一樣，沒有多少時候，議事廳裏已經擁滿了踉踉蹌蹌的一屋子人，老年的，年青的，短打的，長袍的，其中，也雜着幾個女人和孩子。那生賓娘子和根福也被推在靠板壁的角落裏；但</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>都低了頭，手卻被反縛着，衣服全歪斜地勉强掩在了肉體。許多隻惡意的，譏諷的，敵視的，快意的眼睛，全盯住着他們彷彿要把他們吞噬下去一般。</p>
<p>根福臉上還顯着許多條指頭痕，生寶娘子的面孔是蒼白得有點可怕，臉上還掛滿了淚痕，眼睛腫得像一對胡桃；好像她有着滿腔的懊惱和悲憤正在沒處發洩。然而她終於沒有勇氣抬起頭來向這些銳利的眼光看一眼；現在，她已經是一個幹了大罪惡事情的待决的囚犯，她只有期待這臨刑的一霎那了。</p>
<p>「眞是不幸，我們方姓世代下來沒有出過這種醜事，竟想不到給這賤貨來坍盡了方家門的台　。癩頭阿根還沒開口報吿他捉姦的經過時，那個穿着一件捉鷄長衫的金生叔，擊着桌子拉高了嗓子說。</p>
<p>「今天捉賊捉贓捉姦捉雙，證據具在，只要讓阿興老爹說一句公平話，我也就對得起死去的兄弟，同時也對得住方姓的祖宗了」。癩頭阿根頗有禮貌地站在阿興老爹面前說着，很有點兒自豪的樣子。</p>
<p>幾十條眼光又不的而同的投射到他們的臉上身上，彷彿要從他們的身上發現一點什麽或搜出一點什麽來。阿與老爹儘叭啊叭啊地抽着旱烟，聽了阿根的話，一位法官似的，用着一副平和的口吻說：</p>
<p>「本來，這樣年紀輕輕還是正大光明走路的光鮮，反正又沒有人硬要你守節，你看，現在你自己落了個臭名聲還不必說，而且我們方家裏也給你坍光了台……」</p>
<p>事情是終於這樣的决定了—福，本來照幾個年輕人的意見是要在他額上用香火燙字的，後來經他苦苦的哀求及阿興老爹的做好做歹，纔割了他半雙耳朶，以示懲誡。至於生寳娘子，自然從此是不能再姓方了。</p>
<p>她走出了那扇冷殘的祠堂門，嘲笑的聲音在她背後送着，—她感到她的一生從今天起便完結了。現在應該往那兒去呢？她站在長池邊上，望着那黑油油的水面，淌着眼淚。</p>
<p>註—淸明日祭過了祖先，族裏人大家都可吃一頓的。</p>
<h3>看相</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>和一個喜歡弄音樂的朋友上城隍廟買了幾件樂器，就便上一家茶樓歇歇脚。茶樓上茶客很少，大概遝沒有到上市的時候。我們揀了個臨窗的座位，要了兩壺茶，茶堂送過面巾之後，馬上有一個穿破舊中山裝的到我們面前來囉囌了，那是城隍廟裏最出色的相面先生。他手裏托着一隻用香烟盒子做的吃飯工具，上面有兩行我目力所認不淸楚的字，大概是什麽賽諸葛，或凶吉休咎的廣吿術語。他站到我們面前，就用可憐的口氣要求着，「兩位先生帮帮忙，看個相罷，祇要兩毛小洋。」對於那些「先生」，最好的應付方法是不理會，彷彿沒有那樣一個人站在面前一樣，由他獨自吹牛，撤謊，到他的本領使用窮盡。但是那位看相先生見我們不理睬他，他並不運用江湖術語而像一個乞丐似的說出他已整天沒有吃過一粒米的可憐話來。於是我開始移動我的目光去注視他的面部，那是一張像蠟紙那樣可怕的臉，有一對像死鯉魚那樣陷落的眼珠，看了他那付臉相，他非但沒有吃過一粒米，或許他被另一種毒物的刺激所痛苦着。我給了他兩毛錢，揮手呌他走開，我並不想救那樣一個人，我不忍看那種可怕的樣子。他受了兩毛錢，必竟送了我兩句「先生好心腸，天報佑你發財發福」！聳着肩頭溜下茶樓去了。</p>
<p>但是第二個馬上接着來了，那位「先生」比先前的漂亮，他有一付標準服裝—藍袍黑褂，一頂破舊的呢帽挾在手裏，另一個手支着一根粗大的手杖。面盤是胖胖的，上唇留着短短的八字鬚，走路一搖一擺的，不是諷刺他的話，他已應該歸入上海的買辦階級一類的。他站到我們面前，彷彿招呼朋友那樣「用過飯了？」馬上側着頭，像思索的樣子，「兩位先生好久不上廟裏來了？」於是他笑了「我的記性不錯呵！」把手杖敲着地板咯咯作嚮。</p>
<p>從我的記憶中，我沒有遇見過那樣風趣的相面先生，不然，我應該對他們發生好戚的。在社會上做事，往往感到人與人之間虛僞太深，說話要繞道兒，許許多多熱情懇切的話都是用來欺騙對方的。那位相面先生不用廣吿術語入手，就使人打破凡是相面先生都是討厭的影像，我不免隨意點點頭；不過這意思不是回答他，好久不上廟裏來了，是贊美他的看相藝術。</p>
<p>這樣，我們彷彿招呼來了一個熟朋友，他坐到和我們相對的座位上，一只手依舊支着手杖，那樣子是挺瀟洒的。他又重覆了「眞是好久不見兩位上廟裏來了。」忽然他注意到我們座旁的幾件樂器，馬上掉轉語氣：「兩位先生高雅之至，喝喝茶，弄弄音樂，做人是應該這樣自尋快樂的」……　（未完）</p>

<h3>金城之新陣容</h3>
<p>北京路金城大戲院，開幕伊始，即抱定提倡國產影片的宗旨，雖國片產量不多，求過於供，每每發生片荒之虞；但該院寗將國片映期延長。非至萬不得已時，不肯輕易放映西片，即此决開映「摩登時代」，亦係因聯怡公司之情商，映期訂定八天，此後仍將致力於國產影片的放映。茲特將該院不日公映的國產片，簡略介紹於下：</p>
<p>「浪淘沙」——係聯華影業公司第一部有聲對白巨片。金燄，章志直主演。吳永剛編導。全劇寫孤島中人類仇恨嫉妬之故事，新穎別緻，別創一格。定於二十八日起在該院公映。</p>
<p>「化身姑娘」——藝華出品，袁美雲，王引主演，方沛霖初决導演作。</p>
<p>「金鋼鑽」——一部偵探冒險劇，遠勝「翡翠馬」十倍。王徵信領銜全演，徐欣夫導演。明星新片。</p>
<p>「桃源春夢」——新華出品，由韓蘭根劉繼羣主演。是一部極有意義的滑稽片，導演爲楊小仲。</p>
<p>其餘如聯華之「迷途的羔羊」，明星之「海棠紅」，新華之「在歡之夜。藝華之「父子英雜」，天一之「王先生奇俠傳」。俱將陸續在該院放映。影迷之眼福，誠屬非淺也。</p>
<h3>弗萊　白塞洛繆及桃樂絲柯史坦洛合演「小伯時」</h3>
<p>大光明映</p>
<h3>游觀仁有主演「夜會」說</h3>
<p>「夜會」還是姚蘇鳳在明星全盛時代爲黃耐霜編的一個據本。結果爲他編導的「靑春綫，」空前的慘敗，虧了許多本，遂向明星當局辭退。「夜會」就這樣不幸的在明星編劇科擱了下　。後吳邨　幾次想導演「夜會」，但幾次都成爲吊姚蘇鳳的胃口。現在，李萍倩父擬導演「夜會一。這次似乎有成爲事實的可能。女主角大槪仍舊是黃耐霜。男主角呢。有人說許曼麗的外文」游觀仁。游觀仁雖然在「軟性電影代表」的什麽藝聯公司幹過什麽「搖山　　」，可是因爲祗弄了這麽一部糟的片子便壽終正寢的緣故，游觀仁依舊在影迷腦海里是一個陌生的人。吿訪讀者，他是廣東人，他說一口好「廣東官話」，記得某報曾刊許曼麗敎游觀仁的國語，父刋載過劉納鷗與許曼麗的什麽。那末，游觀仁能任「夜會」主角，也許是劉納　之功。果爾的活，游觀仁的廣東官話」　將成爲「夜會的獨特點了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Officers Gather in Tianjin: Deliberations at Zhang Garden Residence, Centered on Commander Tadashiro, Discussing Various North China Diplomatic Issues; Tada Returned Home Yesterday Aboard the Changan Maru; News of Yin [Ju-keng]'s Return from Tianjin to Tongzhou Sparks Concerns of Unstable Schemes</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Ji Military Officer Ishino arrived in Tianjin on the 21st, along with Military Officer Wachi, Sui Military Officer Hayama, and Zhangjiakou Military Officer Omoto. On the morning of the 22nd, they arrived in Tianjin. At 2 PM on the 22nd, centered on Tadashiro, 松室 (Matsumuro), 永見 (Nagami), 飯田 (Iida), 石井 (Ishii), 大本 (Omoto), 和知 (Wachi), 羽山 (Hayama), 今井 (Imai), and other military staff members were invited to the Zhang Garden residence to discuss North China diplomatic issues. The discussion lasted for approximately three hours. After 6 PM, they took a break and will reconvene at 9 PM. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to the opinions of diplomatic observers, a new development in the North China diplomatic negotiations will occur after Tadashiro's arrival in Tianjin. However, people from all walks of life still dare not hold an optimistic view. It is rumored that the Japanese side previously made two demands to the Hebei-Chahar authorities: 1. Financial independence; 2. The establishment of an anti-communist military agreement, using the acceptance of these demands as a condition for the abolition of the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei. However, the authorities did not recognize this, citing sovereignty. Now, in addition to sheltering smuggling, the Japanese side has increased its military strength, intending to force compliance. (22nd China United News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying stated that he will visit Tadashiro and Nagami in the coming days to continue discussing the Hebei-Chahar issue, hoping for an early conclusion. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After Yin [Ju-keng] escorted Tada to meet Tadashiro, he returned to Tongzhou by car at noon on the 22nd, accompanied by 池宗墨 (Chi Zongmo) and 干厦材 (Gan Xiacai). It is said that Yin's ambition is great, recruiting disillusioned Japanese military academy graduates to serve as military instructors in the puppet Eastern Hebei, for unstable schemes. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Military Officer Imai stated that he recently went to Changchun to attend a meeting convened by Sakagaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. He arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 22nd and immediately reported to Commander Tadashiro. He is unaware of the extent to which the Hebei-Chahar diplomacy has progressed, as it is not within his purview. He has only seen reports in the newspapers that it is progressing smoothly. Matsumuro is scheduled to return to Beiping on the 24th, and he will return first on the 23rd. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9 AM on the 22nd, Tada left Tianjin. He departed from the Zhang Garden residence, passed through Miyajima, Matsushima, and Asahi Streets, reviewing the troops along the way. He arrived at the Mitsui Wharf by horse, where he bid farewell to Commander Tadashiro and other military staff, Brigade Commander Kawabe, Regimental Commanders Mutaguchi and Kayashima, Consul Kishii Iwaichi, veterans, Japanese residents, and over a thousand others. Consuls and military attachés from Europe and the United States also led bands and honor guards to see him off. Xiao Zhenying, Chen Juesheng, Sun Weidong, Liu Yushu, and others also joined in the send-off. A 19-gun salute was fired, and military music was played loudly. Tada then boarded the Hiji Maru amidst cheers and set sail for Dagu. He arrived in Tanggu at 1 PM and transferred to the Changan Maru to return home. Nagami, Matsumuro, Ishii, Japanese Vice Consul Nishida, and Police Chief Wakui saw him off to Tanggu and then departed. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese military sources, Tadashiro will visit Song [Zhe-yuan] in Beiping after the third batch of new troops arrives and will also inspect the troops. He will travel to Yushun and Qinhuangdao before June 10th. The third batch of troops, numbering 900, will arrive late on the night of the 29th. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan to Inspect Chahar</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan's throat ailment is gradually healing. He is scheduled to go to Chahar with Zhang Zizhong in the next few days for an inspection. The Hebei Provincial Government Committee's regular meeting today was not convened due to Song's illness. This afternoon, Song invited committee members Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Chen Juesheng, and Chen Zhongfu to his private residence for talks to discuss the committee's affairs and the diplomatic situation. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Juesheng arrived in Beiping from Tianjin at noon on the 22nd. According to reports, the date for the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee meeting has not been set. Plans for the construction of the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Road and the reorganization of various roads are still under consideration. There have been no recent developments in diplomatic issues. He is in Beiping to report to Chairman Song [Zhe-yuan] and will return to Tianjin on the 23rd. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahua and Others Arrive in Hong Kong; This Morning They Will Go to Guangzhou with Ju Zheng and Others; Dai Jitao Returned to Europe on the Same Ship Last Night</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Dai Jitao and Zhu Jiahua arrived in Hong Kong on the Norseman from Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd. Li Wenfan, Liu Jiwen, Huang Jilu, Feng Rui, and others welcomed them at the port and escorted them to the Gloucester Hotel for a rest. Due to the suddenness of the time, Dai was unable to go to Guangdong to participate in the ceremony honoring Chairman Hu [Hanmin]. He returned to Germany on the same ship at 8 PM. Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, and their party decided to take a special train to Guangdong at 7:30 AM on the 23rd. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Dai Jitao and Zhu Jiahua arrived in Hong Kong on a German mail ship in the morning. Liu Jiwen, Deng Qingyang, and others went aboard the ship to greet Ju Zheng and others at the Gloucester Hotel. Dai returned to Europe on the same ship last night. Zhu is scheduled to take a special train to the province with Ju and others on the morning of the 23rd.

<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian, President of the Examination Yuan, was appointed to go to Germany to participate in the World Games and to conduct inspections in various countries. He arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and telegraphed various parties in Nanjing and Shanghai to thank them for their farewell gifts. The original telegram stated: "Central News Agency, please forward to central government agencies, newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai, and the China Boy Scouts Council. I, Xian, was ordered to go to Germany. Thank you for your farewell gifts before my departure. Dai Chuanxian bows in gratitude." (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wakamatsu Visits Foreign Minister Zhang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Wakamatsu visited Foreign Minister Zhang at 10 AM on the 22nd for a courtesy call. He was received by Zhang. Wakamatsu expressed his respect to Zhang and exchanged pleasantries before departing. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Wakamatsu visited Foreign Minister Zhang at 10 AM on the 22nd to express his respect and exchange pleasantries. After a few minutes of conversation, he departed. He informed that the new ambassador, Kawagoe, is scheduled to depart from Japan on June 1st. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Wakamatsu visited Foreign Minister Zhang Qun at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11 AM. Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department, was also present. The meeting lasted for one hour and forty minutes. Prior to the arrival of the new ambassador, Kawagoe, he inquired about the Chinese side's intentions regarding various Sino-Japanese issues. He departed at 0:40. After meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang, Chargé d'Affaires Wakamatsu told reporters that today's meeting was purely a courtesy call and did not touch upon any specific issues. He only exchanged opinions on various issues in his personal capacity. He has not yet received a response from the province regarding the National Government's actions on the smuggling issue, so he did not discuss it. The issue of increased taxes was also not mentioned, he said. (22nd Telecommunication Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shi Yousan's Chief of Staff Assassinated in Tianjin; Ambushed by Thugs in the Japanese Concession—Cause of Death Rumored to Be Revenge—</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Xiangchen, Chief of Staff of Shi Yousan, was ambushed by two thugs on Langsu Street in the Japanese Concession of Tianjin at 8 PM on the 22nd. He was shot multiple times in vital areas and died on the main thoroughfare. The Japanese police temporarily imposed martial law and conducted a large-scale search for the perpetrators, but found nothing. Wang, who was fluent in Japanese, planned everything for Shi. Recently, he was killed due to a private feud with a certain regimental commander of Shi's old subordinates. The cause of death is rumored to be revenge. However, the Japanese believe it has a political background. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Customs Officials Board Trains to Combat Smuggling; Difficult Implementation on the Beining Railway; Chen Juesheng Goes to Beiping to See Song Zheyuan for Instructions; Central Government Formulates Law to Prevent Smuggling on Railways</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Lin Shize returned after visiting Song Zheyuan in Beiping. The authorities fear that the Customs Anti-Smuggling Law will cause unexpected incidents and have instructed Tax Associate Lin to study it with the Beining Railway. On the 22nd, Tax Official Spruell from the Tianjin Customs Anti-Smuggling Department visited the person in charge of the Beining Railway to continue discussions. It is reported that the Jinpu Railway and the Wuhe Water Police Bureau in Hebei have no problem assisting in anti-smuggling efforts. Only the Beining Railway believes that it is difficult to implement the customs officials setting up tax checkpoints at Tianjin East Station, establishing inspection stations along the line, and customs officials inspecting the train, and if smuggled goods are found the railway bureau helping to intercept them. Chen Juesheng took a special train to Beiping at noon on the 22nd to attend the regular meeting of the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee and consult with Song. A decision will be made after his return. The Tianjin Customs and the Jinpu and Beining Railway Bureaus have all received the central government's anti-smuggling regulations, but it is difficult to implement them immediately due to a lack of diplomatic certainty. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to customs sources, the method of customs officials boarding trains to enforce anti-smuggling measures is expected to be implemented on the Jinpu Railway, while negotiations are still needed on the Beining Railway. Sha Bo, head of the Tianjin Customs Anti-Smuggling Section, visited personnel of the Beining Railway on the 22nd to negotiate, but the railway bureau has not yet given a definite answer. Waterway anti-smuggling has been agreed upon, and the Wuhe Water Police Bureau in Hebei has agreed to send police to assist. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Seven articles each for the measures to prevent smuggling on railways and their detailed implementation rules have been formulated jointly by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Railways and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The measures to prevent smuggling on railways are as follows: 1. Customs may establish inspection offices at important stations along each railway line. 2. Customs officials may inspect smuggled goods at important railway stations and on trains. 3. Customs officials may inspect passenger luggage at various stations when deemed necessary. 4. Customs officials shall not disrupt order within stations or on trains, or delay train schedules, when performing anti-smuggling duties at stations or on trains. 5. Railways shall transport goods based on customs tax payment certificates. If untaxed foreign goods arrive at a station for transfer without a certificate, the customs official stationed at the station shall be notified by the railway staff, and the customs shall handle the matter directly. 6. The detention of smuggled goods, whether at the departure station, en route, or at the arrival station, shall be the responsibility of the customs official, with the assistance of the railway bureau. 7. Customs officials shall be stationed at stations day and night to perform anti-smuggling duties. The content of the detailed implementation rules specifies the detailed procedures for preventing smuggling on railways. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Too much smuggled flour has been transported in the past week, causing great disruption to the Tianjin market price. Sales of Shanghai flour and Tianjin flour have stagnated, and speculators in flour have suffered huge losses. The Hebei Provincial Bank has suffered a loss of 300,000 yuan due to storing a large amount of flour. The provincial government has sent a special commissioner to investigate the bank's unauthorized speculative activities. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to the large arrival of rayon and sugar from Tianjin East, the prices have fallen, and there is no profit to be made. Therefore, a large batch of flour, hardware materials, and other goods have recently been transported in. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Many kinds of smuggled goods have been discovered in Hankou in recent days, all imported via the Pinghan Railway. The Chamber of Commerce has presented a petition to the provincial and municipal governments and telegraphed the central government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Railways, and other departments, requesting strict measures to be taken to prevent smuggling. No transportation will be provided for smuggled goods without tax receipts. Those already transported will not be allowed to be picked up and will be confiscated in full. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Smuggling is rampant in various places. Last week, the Wuhu Customs seized over 600 pieces of high-quality tung oil from Sichuan, worth over 10,000 yuan, which were smuggled by a wooden raft arriving from Hankou. All were confiscated. A merchant ship of a certain country sailing from Dalian to Wuhu was found to be carrying smuggled rayon hidden in coal, worth over 7,000 yuan, which was also confiscated and temporarily stored in the Jinling Customs. Wuhu is close to Nanjing. To prevent unscrupulous individuals from smuggling goods, the authorities have strictly ordered the military and police to assist the tax authorities in conducting strict inspections. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Road Construction Plan Finalized; South Manchuria Railway Technical Cooperation Agreement to Be Signed Soon</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The decision has been made to extend the starting and ending points of the Cangzhou-Shijiazhuang Road construction plan, from Qikou to Jingxing, and to incorporate the Jingxing Coal Mine narrow-gauge railway, running parallel to the Zhengtai Railway. The South Manchuria Railway technical cooperation agreement will be signed this month. The South Manchuria Railway is responsible for the construction plan, with the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee in a supervisory position. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Send Personnel to Survey Bohai Bay; Work on Important Passes of the Great Wall Requires Three Months</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Army and Navy have jointly sent a survey team to Qinhuangdao to survey the coastline of eastern Hebei, the harbor situation of Bohai Bay, and important passes of the Great Wall. The work will take three months to complete and is currently underway. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandits in Changli and Other Counties Loot and Burn Everywhere</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Banditry is rampant in Fengrun, Lulong, Changli, and other counties. There are dozens of large and small gangs, with hundreds of bandits in the larger ones and dozens in the smaller ones. They are looting and burning fiercely. The puppet security forces and local militias are conducting searches and suppressions in separate groups. The people of Changli and other seven counties are suffering greatly due to banditry. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>First Batch of Lu Salt Shipped to Japan; Total of 400,000 Tons to Be Exported in Late June</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawanishi, a specialist for investigating Lu Salt from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, is scheduled to go to Beiping. The first batch of Lu Salt to be shipped to Japan is scheduled to be exported in late June at Japan's request, totaling 400,000 tons. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Consul Nagai in Tianjin and Kawanishi went to Hangu and Tanggu on the morning of the 22nd to investigate the production and sales of Xiao salt. They plan to visit Ge Dingyuan, the Director of Transport for the Changlu Salt District, and Xiao Zhenying on the 22nd. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jin Yunpeng Visited Chairman Chiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jin Yunpeng has been living in seclusion in Tianjin, devoted to Buddhism, for over ten years. Recently, at the invitation of Master Taixu, he went to Xuedou Temple in Fenghua to listen to Buddhist scriptures. He passed through Nanjing a few days ago and visited old friends. On the morning of the 22nd, he paid his respects at the Mausoleum and offered flowers. At 3:30 PM, he visited Chairman Chiang, reminiscing about their long separation. He left after more than an hour. He is scheduled to pay his respects to Chairman Lin on the 23rd and leave Nanjing on the 24th. He will visit Duan Qirui in Shanghai before going to Fenghua with Taixu. When asked for his opinion on national affairs, Jin did not wish to express any. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhou Lisheng Talks About the Serious Famine in Southern Hebei</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Lisheng recently inspected various counties in southern Hebei and returned to Beiping on the 21st. On the 22nd, he told reporters that Handan and other counties in southern Hebei, bordering Shanxi and Henan, are also plagued by bandits. The situation was tense when the communist bandits fled to Shanxi, but fortunately, effective precautions were taken, and no incidents occurred. The area is now quiet, and work is being done to repair city walls, build blockhouses, clear the countryside, and prohibit drugs. In Neiqiu, Shahe, and other counties, 50 to 60% of the people eat bran all year round. Some cannot even get bran and only eat tree bark and wild vegetables. Therefore, to prevent bandits, it is necessary to first increase the people's production. Chairman Chiang once said that suppressing bandits requires 70% politics and 30% military force. In my opinion, politics should focus 70% on the economy and 30% on education. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British-Soviet Naval Talks</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The long-awaited British-Soviet naval talks began in London a few days ago. These talks were initiated by the British. It is said that the purpose is twofold: first, to inquire about the Soviet Union's views on the Anglo-American-French naval treaty (signed in London on March 25); second, to establish a similar agreement with the Soviet Union based on the Anglo-German naval agreement concluded in June of last year. In other words, the first is to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the three-nation naval treaty focused on "construction notification" and "qualitative restrictions," and the second is to make the Soviet navy accept the quantitative restrictions based on the Anglo-German naval agreement.</p>
<p>What are the reasons for the British holding such goals? There are several reasons: first, the threat from German naval expansion. For example, three days after the German fleet list was published on the 17th of this month, the London Morning Post commented, "The German fleet list includes a cruiser and eight submarines that were previously unknown. The cruiser is 10,000 tons with eight-inch guns, and the submarines are large and capable of operating in the ocean. Even Germany's sixteen destroyers are stronger than similar warships of the British Navy. Therefore, the German Navy is a formidable enemy of Britain." From this, we can see the general fear of the German Navy. Britain claims that Germany's active strengthening of its navy is entirely due to the stimulation of the Soviet Union's large-navy policy, so it hopes to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union to limit its naval expansion to prevent Germany from competing to build ships and exceeding the 35% of the British Navy that Germany should occupy according to last year's Anglo-German agreement. Second, there is fear of the Soviet Union's plan to build a large navy in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, and Far East, because the strengthening of the Soviet Navy will inevitably stimulate naval competition between the West (Germany) and the East (Japan). This is naturally unfavorable to Britain, and it is also obvious that it directly weakens Britain's power in the Baltic Sea and Aegean Sea regions. In particular, after the troops of Turkey, the Soviet Union's ally, entered the undefended zone of the straits, they provided a barrier to the Soviet Union's Black Sea gateway. Furthermore, in the fundamental sense of anti-Sovietism, Britain is absolutely unwilling for the Soviet Navy to be stronger than Germany's. Therefore, Britain's invitation to the Soviet Union to negotiate is somewhat intended to use an agreement to bind the expansion of its navy.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union's attitude towards these naval talks, it can be clearly seen from the recent note submitted by Soviet Ambassador Maisky to Downing Street. According to a Havas dispatch on the 15th, "The Soviet Union is prepared to participate in any quantitative or qualitative restriction on naval armaments that is acceptable to Germany. The Soviet Union will also reserve the right to refuse any restrictions that Germany refuses. This should be limited to European waters. As for the Far East, the Soviet Union's naval armaments will increase or decrease according to the situation of Japanese armaments." The Soviet Union is threatened by Japan and Germany on both the east and west sides. This threat has become more serious since the widespread rumors of the German-Japanese military alliance. Therefore, it must have a fleet in the Baltic Sea that can resist the German Navy, and a fleet in the Far East that can protect its coast from the Japanese Navy. The increase or decrease of the Soviet Navy will clearly depend on the increase or decrease of the German and Japanese navies. Under the circumstances of the German and Japanese navies competing to expand, even if it signed any naval agreement with Britain, it is unlikely to have any practical significance.</p>
<p>On the day the British-Soviet talks began, Britain also sent notes to the United States and Japan, deciding to increase destroyers by 40,000 tons. This result will inevitably further trigger naval competition among countries. According to the National News Agency on the 18th, Japan has even planned to use this as leverage to strive for the world's largest submarine fleet. Under such circumstances, the outcome of the British-Soviet naval talks is predictable.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Finance Issued a Declaration, Praise was Unanimous at Home and Abroad; A Few Foreign Newspapers Speculated with Ulterior Motives</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Ministry of Finance issued the declaration to stabilize finance, public opinion at home and abroad has been unanimous in its praise. Recently, a few foreign newspapers have speculated greatly about the declaration. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently visited a certain gentleman from the Ministry of Finance, inquiring about the content. He was granted permission to issue a statement as follows: This department's decision to issue the declaration is entirely based on the fact that after the promulgation of the legal tender policy last year, foreign exchange was extremely stable and the national economy was also in good order. Based on past experience and reviewing the current financial situation at home and abroad, it still maintains the position of preserving the independence of our country's monetary system without being constrained by any country's monetary system changes, increasing the legal tender guarantee. Judging from the unanimous approval of public opinion in various countries after the declaration was issued, it can be seen that the speculation of a few foreign newspapers has ulterior motives. Regarding the exchange rate of legal tender against foreign currencies, when the legal tender was implemented, based on the exchange rate against foreign currencies in recent years, it still maintained an independent position from the beginning. As for the fixed rate of exchange between legal tender and the currencies of various countries, it is the basis for international exchange calculations, so the so-called linkage and detachment are all unfounded. Furthermore, the cash reserve portion of our country's issuance reserve has always included both gold and silver, which is clearly stipulated in the Central Bank Law. Its level of fulfillment is actually higher than that of most countries in the world. After the implementation of legal tender, efforts have been made to increase the above-mentioned reserve. Recently, a few ignorant people have mistakenly considered the addition of gold and foreign exchange to the legal tender reserve as a decision of innovation, creating various rumors. Therefore, a clear statement is made in this decision's declaration, because legal tender can buy and sell foreign exchange, and it is natural to have a considerable amount of gold and foreign exchange in the reserve to meet market needs. This method is to consolidate the position of legal tender. Moreover, since the implementation of legal tender, our country's huge foreign exchange reserves stored abroad have not been used. For several months, the legal tender's foreign exchange rate has been extremely stable, which is clear evidence of this. In short, our country's legal tender policy has been aimed at stabilizing the monetary system from the beginning in order to revive the national economy. Now, in order to carry out this purpose, the declaration is re-issued to make the people understand clearly. All speculations, if they are not intended to destroy, are completely ignorant and not worth the attention of knowledgeable people. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Debates National Defense, Preparing for Future Contingencies, Britain Develops War Industries, Promotes National Production Efficiency, Preparedness for War, Minister for Coordination of Defence Explains Future Plans</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons met this afternoon to discuss national defense issues. The debate was opened by Sir Thomas Inskip, Minister for Coordination of Defence, who defended the government's policies. Speaking in the House of Commons in his capacity as Minister for Defence for the first time, his speech did not specifically mention the international situation but stated that the international situation is unpredictable and that the collective action system can inject a new element into the future situation. He then mentioned the topic of national defense, saying that the enhancement of national defense depends on the prosperity or decline of war industries, so war industries should be prepared to deal with all contingencies. In the past four or five years, there have been omissions in this regard, and the current cabinet must find ways to remedy them. The way to remedy them is to store ammunition and ordnance. "Because once war breaks out, it will be too late to expand the output of munitions. Therefore, we should promote beef production efficiency now so that at the first sign of alarm, all industries in the country can manufacture munitions within 24 hours. Its output may even increase two or three times more than usual, which is not impossible. It can adapt to the needs of modern warfare without being hindered. Regarding the issue of munitions, a survey of more than 900 domestic factories has been conducted to determine the nation's resources and production situation. "Now it is planned to completely make up for the accumulated shortcomings within three or four years. I am deeply convinced that if we go with perseverance, we will be able to achieve success." (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Adapting to the Needs of Modern Warfare</p>
<p>(London) Sir Thomas Inskip, Minister for Coordination of Defence, today presented the budget for office expenses in the House of Commons and issued his first important statement since taking office. His words have created a good impression.</p>
<p>Mr. Inskip detailed the nature and scope of the work he has undertaken in the nine weeks since taking office. His cautionary words were, "We must have a production capacity that can be transferred to meet the needs of large-scale modern warfare within 24 hours' notice, because once the storm arises, we may not have the time to expand our production."</p>
<p>Enhancing the Concept of World Security</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, Mr. Inskip first stated the points of disagreement between the opposition party and the government party, saying that the opposition party believes that the preparations the country is currently making contain ominous signs, while the government party feels that Britain's national defense plan will not cause any panic in any country in the world, but can enhance the most important concept of world security. He believes that the government party's opinion is correct. Those who are responsible for planning the necessary strategy now have to deal with the new factors of national defense military preparations having to participate in collective actions in accordance with the League of Nations Charter in expected or unexpected circumstances. The Imperial Defence Committee is now reviewing the issues of warships and fleets and air force armaments. Although spectacular plans and resolutions worthy of praise are sufficient to move people, he does not only focus on this, but if he considers it necessary, he will not back down from any major resolutions.</p>
<p>Scientific Research on National Defence Planning</p>
<p>The problem of wartime food involves details such as transportation, storage, distribution, and domestic production. A committee has now been formed to study it. Sir William Beveridge has agreed to serve as chairman. All matters related to food supply must be considered. National defense matters are of great importance, and scientific research is essential. Therefore, the support of major scientists is now being sought to develop national defense plans. Raw materials, workers, and industrial technical capabilities are now being investigated in detail. A detailed inspection of 400 factories has been conducted and an initial inspection of 500 factories has been conducted. The relevant factories have been classified and inspectors have been assigned to each factory and are listed in forms under the jurisdiction of various agencies. Not only the factories that manufacture shells and other items, but also the factories that manufacture equipment are all included in the detailed registers that are classified. He hopes that orders can be distributed within a few months, placing orders for necessary items from various factories and promoting their productivity.</p>
<p>Expanding the Air Force Triples</p>
<p>Mr. Inskip continued that because the air force has tripled, there is a need for a large number of aircraft, so it is necessary to expand the aircraft manufacturing industry. He is now trying to recruit automobile manufacturers to create a reserve for aircraft production, and they have been asked to add new factories or expand their factory bases at government expense. The remuneration they receive is management expenses, and the added factory buildings will be the property of the government, and will be managed and maintained by the factory. The government will adopt strict methods to prevent price gouging and profiteering. The government is also preparing plans to protect merchant ships, and passive plans to protect civilians are also being prepared.</p>

<p>Churchill spoke extensively during the debate, saying that the role of the head of the supply agency, connected with strategic thinking, seems to be a major organizational error. To illustrate this with an example, Mr. Inskip must handle difficult problems such as how to maintain British hegemony in the Mediterranean in newly changing diplomatic situations, and the danger that Soviet Russian military power is not only a threat to Britain through aerial bombardment, but also the danger of enemy aircraft carrying troops into the country. At the same time, he must be responsible for ensuring that the country has a sufficient supply of various necessary raw materials, which may be difficult to manage at the same time. Today, the situation is getting worse and worse, and the distance from the concept of peace and security is getting farther and farther than it was a year ago. Britain must go through a long period of time before it can change from unprepared to prepared, and during this period, Europe may reach a dangerous extreme. Therefore, he advocates setting up a munitions department and inviting the country's most active young entrepreneurs to help run it.</p>
<p>Churchill also mentioned the speed of production and the priority of government orders. Mr. Inskip replied that the government does not have mandatory powers. In view of the actions of foreign governments, Churchill wants the British government to emulate them and place a large part of the industry on a wartime footing, but what the British government is doing now is, on the one hand, to obtain successful results, and on the other hand, not to cause inappropriate disturbance to ordinary trade, but future events may cause the government to change its original intention, which is also not known.

<p>How to Prevent Japanese and German Militarism</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Sinclair, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, took the floor, saying that the international situation is full of danger. The cabinet should let the people know and understand the true situation. He then attacked Italian fascism, saying that Italy has already occupied a strong position in the Near East military strategy, and its momentum is aggressive. The reason for this is that the current British government is weak and incompetent, which is the cause of it. "If we look further afield, we will see that the Japanese warlords in the Far East are powerful and spare no effort in expanding outwards. Looking closer to home, Germany is rapidly rearming, without remorse or fear. What can we do to prevent all these things?"</p>
<p>The Crisis Lurks and Becomes More Intense</p>
<p>At this time, Winston Churchill, the leader of the extreme wing of the Conservative Party, took the floor and strongly criticized the national defense policy adopted by the current government and expressed dissatisfaction with the organization of the Ministry for Coordination of Defence, saying that "the ministry's responsibilities are too great and its powers are insufficient to match them." He also said that looking at all countries in Europe, they are all competing to deploy military equipment, and all industries are used for war preparations. The scale and tension of the situation are worrying. In the Far East, Japan is also strengthening its military and preparing for war, and the whole country is in a frenzy. The various dangers that lurked in the past have all been revived and have become more intense. The reason for this is nothing else than the serious confrontation between Britain and Italy. In conclusion, Churchill advocated the establishment of a munitions department and made it responsible for reorganizing the relationship between the government and private industry, and asked the government to report to the public the news it had obtained about the "large-scale production situation" of German war industries, so that everyone could understand.

<h3>Italy Does Not Want to Start a War Lightly Unless Absolutely Necessary, General Badoglio is Ordered to Return Home to Plan National Defence</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Cabinet is scheduled to meet on May 20, the first since the annexation of Albania. At that time, the newly appointed Albanian Governor General Badoglio can return to the Italian capital. The general's decision to return to the capital from Albania for a short break is said to be for only a few days. It is now a public secret that the general became ill due to overwork during the Italian-Albanian War. Mussolini will now discuss with the general how Italy should respond if the League of Nations Executive Council decides at its next meeting to continue sanctions against Italy. In that case, Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations. People in this question do not believe there is a danger of war, because Italy is unwilling to do this unless absolutely necessary in the European war. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, Governor-General of Abyssinia, set out from his post and flew to Asmara, a city in Italian Eritrea, at noon today. After returning to the capital, he will be received and commended by King and Emperor of Abyssinia, Victor Emmanuel III, and Prime Minister Mussolini. It is rumored that the general was ordered to return home to plan for national defense, so as to be able to respond to future European war situations. Officials have recently denied this explanation, saying that it is unfounded, and said that the general is 65 years old and has been leading his troops and fighting in foreign lands for five months, which is quite difficult. In addition, the climate in Abyssinia is harsh, and he feels slightly unwell, so he must return home to recuperate. After arriving in Rome, he must go to the Faucilles spa, 80 kilometers from the capital, for a short period of recovery. On July 7, the anniversary of Italian unification, he will return here to participate in the grand military parade. As for the celebration banquet for the conquest of Albania, it will be held on a scheduled date after the anniversary of unification. According to what is generally known, although the official made such a statement, General Badoglio was originally the Chief of the General Staff, and his decision to return home will definitely lead to a new study of the national defense plan.

<h3>Italy Reaffirms its Guarantee of Respecting British Interests, Grandi Visits the British Foreign Secretary, Reviews the Situation in Albania</h3>
<p>(London) It is believed that when Italian Ambassador Grandi met with Foreign Secretary Vansittart at the Foreign Office today, they must have had a general discussion on the Abyssinian situation. Although it is not possible to obtain accurate information about the truth of the conversation, it is expected that the Italian ambassador will have reiterated Italy's statement that it has no intention of encroaching on British interests everywhere.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Refuse to Withdraw Troops from Afghanistan</h3>
<p>At the same time, it is heard that the British government is currently opposed to withdrawing a company of Indian troops stationed at the British Embassy in the Afghan capital, because it cannot yet be determined that all dangers of the recent unrest in the Afghan capital have been eliminated. This company of troops was dispatched from India to reinforce the embassy's guard. Italy has also requested that France withdraw 150 French troops stationed in Diredawa to protect railway industry assets. It is expected that France will also refuse. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently declared that French colonial troops are currently stationed in the foreign expatriate area of Diredawa, Afghanistan (on the railway line from Djibouti to the Afghan capital). This deployment was made after consultations with Italian authorities. The Italian government has not yet formally approached France to request the withdrawal of these troops. Regarding this matter, the French government believes that the safety of the railway and French expatriates in the area is still difficult to ensure. Furthermore, several aspects of the Italian occupation of Afghanistan from a legal perspective have not yet been clarified. France will only consider withdrawing troops after these two issues are resolved. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Radical Party Resolves to Participate in Future Cabinet; External Rumors Disproved</h3>
<p>(Paris) The executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party has passed a resolution for the party leader to participate in the new "Popular Front" government. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the future Prime Minister Léon Blum held talks with former Radical Socialist Party leader Édouard Herriot a few days ago, rumors spread that the two sides had failed to reach an agreement. Léon Blum recently published an article in the official Socialist Party newspaper "Le Populaire" to defend himself, saying, "I have repeatedly corrected and repeatedly affirmed, but the rumors continue. I can only defend myself again. It is said that during my conversation with Mr. Herriot, we disagreed on the financial and economic policies that the future cabinet should adopt. In fact, we did not discuss financial or economic issues at all during our meeting. We only discussed diplomatic matters, and there were no minor disagreements. It is not difficult to imagine the purpose of the newspapers' fabrications. They want to spread rumors and mislead people into believing that the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party have theoretical or practical policy rifts, and that the future cabinet is already suffering from congenital ailments. The executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party is scheduled to meet this afternoon. At that time, a decision will be made on the issue of participating in the future cabinet, and the external rumors will be cleared up in one fell swoop." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party is scheduled to meet this afternoon to decide on two issues: joining the future cabinet and how to rectify the discipline of the parliamentary party. "L'Ordre" reported, "When the executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party meets, former party leader Édouard Herriot, who is preparing to participate in the future cabinet as Foreign Minister, will give a speech to explain. This is the most noteworthy issue of today's meeting. It is said that there is a risk of another split within the party. This is a common occurrence whenever the party's executive committee decides to meet. But in fact, in recent months, there has been a brewing of division within the party. When the meeting is held today, the committee members from the Hérault branch will definitely demand rectification of discipline so that the party members will vote in unison in the lower house."

<h3>Traditional Diplomatic Policy Remains Unchanged in France; Upholding Collective Security; Willing to Cooperate with Friendly Nations</h3>
<p>(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu met with future Prime Minister Léon Blum and Acting Foreign Minister Peng Gu this morning. Peng Gu also received Soviet Deputy Commissioner Khesin. Political figures believe that these actions are in preparation for the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council (scheduled for June 16th). Peng Gu will also continue negotiations with key figures from the Little Entente, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, hoping to prepare everything for the future cabinet. The future Prime Minister Léon Blum has always advocated maintaining France's traditional policy, which is based on strict adherence to the League of Nations Covenant and the principle of mutual assistance. All countries that have signed treaties of friendship or mutual assistance with France should cooperate closely with it. France also hopes to cooperate seamlessly with the United Kingdom on major international issues. During Titulescu's meeting with Peng Gu today, they also discussed the reorganization of the League of Nations. Both sides believe that all proposals that aim to strengthen the actions of all countries against aggressor nations will be supported by France and its allies. Conversely, all proposals that would weaken the international obligations of the member states of the League of Nations should be resolutely opposed. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>First Action of New Foreign Minister: Seeking to Lift Sanctions Against Italy; Three Possibilities</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to news from political circles here, the first action of the new French Foreign Minister is to seek the lifting of sanctions against Italy. There are three possibilities for the success of this step: First, since the conquest of Afghanistan, these sanctions have become an ineffective punishment. Second, if these sanctions continue to be implemented, Mussolini will be forced to abandon his Stresa Front. Third, these sanctions are very harmful to French trade. (Guomin, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Prepares to Adopt Retaliatory Measures Against Sanctioning Countries</h3>
<p>(Rome) Today's semi-official Italian newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" published an article by Gaeda, hinting that Italy will take retaliatory measures against sanctioning countries. Italy's commercial agreements with sanctioning countries have been automatically cancelled due to the sanctions. These commercial agreements will be greatly revised when they are renewed in the future, allowing Italy to permanently exclude products from sanctioning countries as the French West High Command is now seeking to liberate the national economy.

<h3>Italian Government Accuses Afghan Troops of Using Dum-Dum Bullets; League of Nations Secretariat Publishes Documents</h3>

Some of the bullets are engraved with the words "Made by Elan Factory, London, Burbenham Bez Factory". Please see photos and attachments.

<h3>French Missionary Expelled; French Government Protests to Italy</h3>

<h3>Roosevelt Orders Increase in Tariffs to Counteract Japanese Goods; Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Import Taxes Increased; Japan-U.S. Cotton Textile Rift</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently announced that the import tax on cotton yarn should be immediately increased to 34 percent ad valorem, and the import tax on cotton fabrics should be increased to 43.5 percent ad valorem. Recently, Japanese cotton goods have been dumped in large quantities, and cotton and textile factories in New England have protested. The President then, in accordance with the Tariff Act, the import tax on cotton goods may be increased to 50 percent, increased the import tax rate on foreign cotton goods to counteract this. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Boston Fisher, the director of the National Cotton Textile Association, stated today that in the first three months of 1936, Japanese cotton goods exported to the United States amounted to as much as 21 million yards. He also criticized the State Department authorities, saying that they were groundlessly supporting the position of the Japanese textile industry. As for the point that the International Labor Conference in Geneva will discuss the adoption of a 40-hour workweek worldwide, Fisher said that the wages in other countries are extremely low, especially in Japan. Even if working hours are reduced, the United States will still find it difficult to compete. The current U.S. policy is actually helping Japan solve its unemployment problem at the expense of the U.S. textile industry. (Guomin, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the Japan-U.S. cotton cloth agreement have broken down. According to news received by a certain Tokyo newspaper, the U.S. has announced a supplementary tax on cotton cloth that proves the breakdown of the negotiations. The U.S. State Department claims that the purpose of the supplementary tariff is to maintain the original level of the agreement for Japanese cotton cloth imports, with a maximum limit of 50 percent. The U.S. consumes 7 billion square yards of cotton cloth annually, of which Japanese cotton cloth accounts for only 50 million square yards. The U.S. is making an issue of such a small amount and causing the negotiations to break down. Japan considers this behavior by the U.S. to be unfriendly. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the breakdown of Japan-U.S. cotton cloth negotiations on the 22nd as follows: The U.S. government recently consulted with the Japanese government at the request of the U.S. Tariff Commission and related industry members to impose a fixed limit on the annual amount of cotton cloth imported from Japan, and notified that if this matter could be agreed upon, the U.S. government would not increase tariffs. However, Japanese industry members also intend to control the export volume of cotton cloth, so the government, out of respect for the position of industry members, has repeatedly resolved to negotiate with the U.S. government on this matter. However, the implementation of controlled export volume for exports to foreign countries and through third countries cannot be successful in supervision without the assistance of the other country. Especially for exports through third countries, if the other party does not provide assistance, Japan will not be able to supervise them, and those subject to control will suffer losses, and only promote exports outside of control. Therefore, for the sake of accurate control and to prevent future disputes, Japan has made every effort to request the U.S. for assistance in the above-mentioned supervision methods. Unfortunately, the U.S. government stated that it lacked a legal basis for such assistance and refused to recognize it, so on May 21, it implemented an increase of 42 percent in the tax rate stipulated in the 1930 Tariff Act for Japanese cotton cloth. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Australia Increases Tariff Barriers; Major Blow to Japanese Exports</h3>
<p>Canberra Australian authorities announced a new trade policy in the House of Representatives today. The main points are a large increase in tariffs and a licensing system for many foreign goods. This policy will be unfavorable to both the United States and Japan. With this move, Australian authorities intend to transfer the trade of 2 million pounds of goods imported into Australia by those who are not enthusiastic about buying Australian goods to the hands of Britain and other buyers of Australian goods. In the future, special taxes will be levied on foreign cotton goods and rayon goods in lieu of ad valorem taxes. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Manufacturers Oppose Ordering National Flags from Japan; Demand Government Increase Taxes and Suppress</h3>
<p>(London) Leigh, Lancashire, is the center of the British national flag manufacturing industry. Recently, due to King Edward VIII's coronation ceremony scheduled for May next year, and a large number of national flags to be ordered from Japan, the manufacturers of national flags in the area are very dissatisfied. They recently met here to discuss this matter. Because the national flags made in Japan are cheap, and British manufacturers cannot compete with them, they requested the government to impose tariffs on foreign imported flags to protect the domestic national flag manufacturing industry.

<h3>Sino-U.S. Negotiations; Protest Tung Oil Sales Channels; Establishment of Semi-Official Trade Company</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, responsible officials here learned that the negotiations between the Chinese Embassy and the Export-Import Bank may be related to funding for U.S. imports of Chinese tung oil. China recently discussed with U.S. officials methods to improve tung oil in order to promote exports to the U.S. This move is noteworthy. The Ministry of Commerce announced today that it will organize a semi-official trade company with China specializing in tung oil and other items, with a capital of 2 million Chinese currency, half of which will be raised. After the company is established, trade in vegetable oils can be further developed. According to statistics, the U.S. imported Chinese tung oil worth US$5,137,000 this spring, compared to US$188,000 during the same period last year.

<h3>Fellow Townsmen from Guangzhou Bay Residing in Guangdong Petition Regarding the Tragic Incident, Requesting Punishment of the Culprits, Compensation for Losses, and Cancellation of the Newly Implemented Head Tax</h3>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Regarding the case in which fellow countrymen in Guangzhou Bay were forced to pay a body tax by the local government and in which petitioning civilians were shot and killed by Vietnamese soldiers, recently, people from Potou Township in Guangzhou Bay and fellow townsmen residing in Guangzhou have established the Potou Tragedy Support Association to actively seek redress. On the 16th of the month, representatives from Potou Township and various districts in Guangzhou Bay, along with members of the Wu Chuan County and Zhu Xi County student associations, numbering dozens, carrying petition banners and led by a large banner reading "Guangzhou Bay Potou Tragedy Support Association Petition Group," first went to the Southwest Executive Department. Representatives Chen Huanmou, Hua Bin, Lu Chengxing, and Chen Shanlu Zhen Wu requested to see the officials to report the details of the Potou Tragedy. The department secretary offered suggestions, promising to convey the case details to the various committee members. Subsequently, Committee Member Zou Yu replied orally by telephone, stating that the case would be brought up for discussion at the next meeting. The petitioning representatives then went to the Provincial Government to petition and submitted the petition. The Provincial Government sent a secretary, Mr. Zhou, to accept the petition. The petitioning representatives then rushed to the Office of the Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi to meet with Gan Jiehou. Special Commissioner Gan inquired in detail about the tragedy from the petitioning representatives, promising to first protest to the French Consul in Guangzhou and then report the full details of the tragedy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so that negotiations could be held with the French Ambassador to China and the French Governor-General of Annam. The representatives were satisfied and left. The petition submitted by the petitioning representatives and the telegram from the Support Association to the National Government are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of petitioning, it is the case that in the past, due to the weakness of the Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou Bay was forcibly occupied by the French under the pretext of stationing troops and storing coal, but in reality, they are colonizing it. Moreover, in recent years, the nation's strength has not recovered, and foreign capital is powerless. The lives and deaths of the local people are at the mercy of others. The tragic situation in the past has been repeatedly reported to our government through bitter complaints. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, wanting to cause the tens of thousands of compatriots in the area to perish completely after the successive wind disaster last year and the drought this spring. They are not only obstructing the disaster relief efforts of charitable organizations, but also increasing the burden of heavy taxes, such as the collection of an additional five times the land tax and the recent imposition of a head tax, all of which are driving our compatriots to their doom. Therefore, on the 23rd of the previous month, the people of Potou District spontaneously joined together to petition the French government. However, those French imperialists have no regard for China. They not only do not understand the people's feelings, but also cruelly opened fire and shot, resulting in the tragic death of seven people on the spot and countless injuries. Justice has been lost, and humanity does not exist. Therefore, on the 10th of this month, various sectors of Guangzhou Bay residing in the province and the Wu Chuan County and Zhu Xi County student associations initiated and convened a temporary general meeting. During the meeting, the details of this tragedy were explained in detail, and the crowds made a tearful plea to your government, putting forward the following items: 1. Negotiate to abolish the head tax and abolish the same kind of harsh levies as the head tax. 2. Negotiate that future land taxes should be collected according to the Chinese tax rate. 3. Negotiate the punishment of the murderers, compensation for the families of the victims, compensation for losses, and a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. 4. The Chinese compatriots in Guangzhou Bay should be responsible for guaranteeing the safety of life and property. 5. According to the decisions of the Washington Conference, Guangzhou Bay should be recovered as soon as possible. We earnestly request complete adoption and responsible coordination for negotiation and implementation, so as to pacify the living and comfort the dead. We will await your orders with utmost eagerness. Guangzhou Bay Potou Tragedy Support Association,</p>
<p>Telegram</p>
<p>(Headings omitted) Guangzhou Bay has unfortunately suffered from consecutive years of floods and droughts, and the people cannot bear it. Recently, French imperialists have reinstated the collection of head taxes and prevented local charitable organizations from providing relief, resulting in the spontaneous joint petition of the masses on the 23rd of last month. However, the French not only did not show compassion for the people's feelings but also incited the shooting and killing of seven people and wounding dozens more, a heartless and inhumane act. We humbly urge you to swiftly instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate seriously in order to uphold the lives of the people and maintain the dignity of the nation. We await your orders with the utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted. Another telegram stated (Headings omitted) The Guangzhou Bay tragedy is becoming increasingly serious. Currently, transportation between Chinese and foreigners is cut off, heavy troops are stationed in various villages, arrests are being made, and forced levies are being imposed. Spring plowing is hopeless. If swift negotiations are not conducted, a major disaster will result. We respectfully report. According to reports, the Guangdong authorities have telegraphed instructions to the Southern District Pacification Headquarters to investigate the case details for review and action. Furthermore, after receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also telegraphed Gan Jiehou, the Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi, to collect evidence nearby and investigate the truth in order to protest to the French envoy in China.</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu and Kong Xiangrong Inspect the Tail of the Yellow River; Han and Kong Agree on a Yellow River Management Plan: Dredge Bends and Excavate Silt to Clear the River</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River has been a source of trouble for a long time, and in recent years it has become even more severe. The losses to the nation and its people are incalculable. Kong Xiangrong, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, believes that the riverbed is silting up and rising every year, and that the tail of the river is blocked, making it difficult for the water to flow smoothly. If fundamental measures are not taken quickly, the future disasters will be even worse than they are today. Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu shares this view, so they agreed to make a joint on-site inspection of the Yellow River estuary to discuss ways to dredge and clear the river channel to facilitate water flow and prevent breaches. They departed on the 17th of this month and returned to Jinan at 12:00 midnight on the 20th, a four-day round trip. I also accompanied them as a reporter to get a full view of the Yellow River estuary, and will describe the situation below.</p>
<p>Plan to Divert Water Along the River for Defense</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, Han Fuqu, and their party departed from Jinan by car at noon on the 17th, accompanied by An Lisen, chief engineer of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, engineers Zhang Du and Wu Nankai, Liu Bingzhong, director of the River Defense Team, Guo Zhigang and Zhang Liansheng, advisors to the Shandong Provincial Government, Liu Zhaogang, chief of the Second Section, Pan Yifen, chief of the Engineering Section of the River Affairs Bureau, and a squad of hand gun brigade guards. They first arrived at Luokou and proceeded along the south bank of the Yellow River levee, inspecting the river works and inquiring about defense matters along the way. While passing Yangziba, Kong and Han discussed the Yellow River management plan and generally agreed on the principles. Han believed that the Yellow River channel is higher than the surrounding land, making it a natural water tower. Instead of utilizing it, it has become a major problem. He proposed to find ways to dredge the rivers on both banks of the Yellow River and build dams to open and release water, which would not only permanently reduce floods but also allow for irrigation. In the future, he plans to experiment with a method of setting up dams to release water for irrigation in the Lijin area. Kong said that he intended to divert the Yellow River water into the Tuhai River at Xiangshan, with the same goal. The plan has been drafted and submitted to the Economic Commission, but has not yet been approved. He hopes that this matter can be successful. Although it requires a lot of money, it can save a lot if the military is used. Han deeply appreciated his words. Kong also said that regarding the fundamental management of the Yellow River, that evening, they arrived at the Yanjiagang Work Fan Department in Lijin County and stayed overnight. Zhao Mingyuan, commander of the First Route Militia, Huang Xingyan, the county magistrate, and others all crossed the river from the county seat to the south bank to meet them. Kong and Han also discussed departure matters, as Zhao had been to the estuary many times and was very familiar with the situation there.</p>
<p>Departing in the Rain, Going Downstream</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the morning on the 18th, a sudden thunderstorm broke out, gradually subsiding after four hours. At this time, Zhao Mingyuan, commander of the First Route Militia, had already prepared departure matters at the automobile station. A total of three large boats and four civilian boats were prepared by the headquarters for the ride, along with nine small boats for replacement when the water was shallow along the way. After Kong and Han got up and had breakfast, it was already after nine o'clock. The rain stopped, but the dark clouds were still thick, threatening to fall, and the northwest wind was blowing, making it quite cold. Many of the accompanying personnel did not bring cold-weather clothing, which was quite difficult, but they still boarded the boat and proceeded in the rain and cold. Zhao Mingyuan also accompanied them. Han and advisors Zhang and Guo rode in one boat, Kong and the reporter rode in one boat, and Zhao and section chiefs Pan and Liu rode in one boat. The other boats carrying Han's guards and part of Zhao's militia were all cargo boats, with very narrow upper and lower decks. In addition, the wind was unfavorable, and the boat moved very slowly. By four o'clock in the afternoon, they had only traveled forty li, reaching the confluence of Luanjingzi, the lowest reaches of the Yellow River. This is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, as the third section of the River Affairs Bureau ends at Ninghai, and there is no River Affairs Bureau below Ninghai.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Divides into Two Branches, North and South</p>
<p>This is where the Yellow River divides into branches, about 140 li from the estuary. From Yanjia to here is 40 li, totaling 180 li. The main stream originally flowed northeast from here, passing Douyaitou, and then dividing into two branches to enter the sea. In 1931, the northeast channel suddenly silted up, so it changed its course to the southeast, along Qingshui Gully, passing Qiujiazhuang, Shenshupo, Xujiawu, and other places, to enter the sea at Taiping Bay (Dongzhuni). By 1935, the southeast channel was also not draining smoothly, and a large amount of Yellow River water flowed northeast again, taking the old Douyaitou channel and dividing into two branches to enter the sea. This is because there is a silted beach at the turning point downstream of Luanjingzi, forcing the southeast stream to flow southwest first before turning east and southeast. As a result, the northeast stream has the largest flow, accounting for 60-70% of the total river, while the southeast stream accounts for only 30-40%. In addition, there are several small streams flowing east into the sea, which are difficult to examine in detail. To the east of the confluence of Luanjingzi, there is a pool of accumulated water. In 1934, a small breach occurred to the north, which Zhao Mingyuan blocked in May 1935 to protect the cultivated area, and a long dike was built along this bank. It is said that there was another breach in the fall of 1935, which was quickly blocked again. There are now several small huts at the confluence, all made of reed mats and mud, for temporary small businesses, supplying boatmen in preparation for a major flood, and then abandoning them, so they are not built for long-term use.</p>
<p>Cutting Bends and Straightening Two Large Silted Beaches</p>
<p>The silted beach at Luanjingzi bypasses the original main riverhead by eight li before returning to the southeast main stream. The silted beach is triangular in shape, with an area of about 20 square li, and is directly in line with the northwest main river. The distance in between is only about two li. If the bend is cut and straightened by digging through the middle, the water flow will definitely be able to collect the effect of unobstructed flow, and the main current can be moved entirely to the southeast. Fifteen or sixteen li downstream of Luanjingzi, at Shouguang Weizi, there is also a silted beach, which is circular in shape. When the Yellow River reaches here, it also has to bypass a large bend, with an area of about 12 square li. If the bend is cut and straightened, and the river channel is dug, the project would only be a little over one li, smaller than Luanjingzi, and the effect of clearing the river flow would not be less. Kong Xiangrong paid close attention to these two silted beaches, earnestly inquiring about the situation from the boatmen, believing that they have lived here for a long time, are more familiar with the geography, and their views are not without merit. That day, Kong, Han, and their party all stayed overnight on the boat at Luanjingzi. On the morning of the 19th, the sky had cleared up. Around nine o'clock, they set off along the old river channel in the southeast stream. Because the original boat was too large and the water was shallow, it could not travel, so they changed to a small boat to proceed. After an hour, they bypassed the diagonal of the eight-li-plus silted beach at Luanjingzi. Kong Xiangrong's boat was in the lead and immediately stopped, not advancing. After about half an hour, Han Fuqu's boat arrived, and they disembarked together to survey the topography of the silted land. Looking at the boat on the opposite main river, it was exactly in a straight line, with a distance of about two li, hindering the water flow greatly. If the bend were cut and straightened, the construction would be simple and the effect would be great. It was decided to send a survey team to measure it in order to prepare a construction plan. Then they boarded the boats again and continued to advance. The width of the river channel was only five or six zhang, and the water depth varied from three to two chi. On both banks of the river, the silted land was boundless, with reeds growing intermittently, swaying in the wind. Because it was too close to the river, it was often subject to flooding, so no one cultivated it, and it was all barren. There were a few thatched huts, two or three oxen, and sparse population, making it even more desolate as they went further. Beyond the river water and silted land, there was almost nothing to see. After another ten li, they reached Shouguang Weizi, bypassing its circumference for about six li. The farmhouses on this bank, and the farmhouses on the opposite main river that are difficult to reach, are less than two li apart. Cutting and straightening the bend is easier than at Luanjingzi, and the effect of smoothing the river flow is also not small. Kong Xiangrong decided to plan the construction by the survey team after surveying it together. After passing the large bend of Shouguang Weizi, there is the Hecha River, flowing from north to south and converging here. This is the accumulated water from the breach at Luanjingzi flowing south. After passing this point, the water was flowing southeast.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Disaster Victims Farming</p>
<p>From here on, the river flow was wider than before, about 200 Chinese feet, and the water was also deeper than before, flowing straight without obstacles or difficulties. The silted fields on both banks were boundless. They then passed Jingtiaoduo to Badazu, the area where Shandong disaster victims were farming, which was managed by Zhao Mingyuan. There are now more than 5,000 farming households, totaling more than 20,000 people. Many people gathered on the shore, staring at them. Looking into the distance, there were three to five villages. The farmers were all busy with cultivation. Many boats were moored along the bank, presumably for transporting food, firewood, and grass to the farmers. Han Fuqu got off the boat here for a brief inspection and gave a speech to the farmers, and then continued on, passing Tuozi. The river water was shallower than before, with many silted beaches exposed in the middle. After another six or seven li, the Yellow River divided into two branches, north and south. The water was only about one chi deep where the river divided. They still followed the south route. The boatmen and soldiers all got into the water to push the boat along. After half a li or so, the water gradually deepened, and they continued to sail. The river surface was about 120 meters wide, and the silted land on both sides was still boundless, all of which were river channels in the past. Other than the nine boats carrying Kong, Han, and their party, there were no other merchant ships to be seen.</p>
<p>Not a Blade of Grass, All Habitation Disappears</p>
<p>There was not a blade of grass on either side, nor was there any habitation. There were no place names. However, there were wetlands on both sides, which were caused by the rising tide blocking the Yellow River from flowing downstream. After the tide receded, the wetlands were still exposed. Looking east from here, white sails were lined up, faintly visible. The estuary was probably in sight. Moving further forward, the coastal ships and sails became more visible. The boat continued to move forward vigorously along the two banks of the river. By the time they were near the estuary, it was 8:15. The small steamboat was waiting offshore, its signal lights whistling. The militia on the boat called to it with signals to enter the harbor, but it was unsuccessful because the water was small. The boats also anchored and stayed overnight because it was late. Only Zhao and advisors Zhang and Guo drove small boats overnight to catch the small steamboat outside the estuary and stayed on the boat. The rest of the people were all moored at the estuary. At five o'clock in the morning on the 20th, Kong and Han got up one after the other. Looking around, it was a vast expanse of water, with only silted beaches visible in the water. The Yellow River flows into the sea here, becoming a diffuse flow, with no river channel to be found. The width was immeasurable. According to the data, this branch only accounts for 30-40% of the total flow, but it is so vast. The 60% that flows into the sea from Douyaitou must be even more severe than this. The size of the Yellow River can be seen here. No wonder breaches occur every year, often causing major disasters.</p>
<p>Going Directly to the Estuary, Returning by Boat</p>
<p>Before long, the sun rose high, and the boats separately weighed anchor and sailed towards the small steamboat. They arrived in about an hour. Along the way, the mouth of the Yellow River was not visible. After boarding the small steamboat, two more civilian boats were towed along for the Kong, Han, and their entourage to ride in and to carry luggage. Kong, Han, Zhang, Guo, and the reporter all rode on the steamboat. During the journey, Kong and Han talked and felt that after inspecting the mouth of the Yellow River, managing the Yellow River was not impossible. The plan for the fundamental strategy requires a lot of money and a detailed plan must be made. However, the things that can be done now with little doubt and great results are: First, cut and excavate the two silted beaches downstream of Luanjingzi and at Shouguang Weizi (the cost is expected to be only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan). Second, purchase dredgers to excavate the mouth of the Yellow River, so that in the future, the tail of the river will be unimpeded, and the siltation and flood problems in the middle and upper reaches will naturally be reduced (the cost of two dredgers is expected to be only several hundred thousand to one million yuan). It was decided to do these two things first. Kong and Han would prepare a plan and jointly send a telegram to the central government to request funding, and first borrow a dredger from the Xiaoqing River to experiment with dredging. After the tail of the river is dredged in the future, if small steamships are used, it will be more convenient for merchants and people. The central government has ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to prepare a detailed plan for the Jinan-Lanfeng Railway for approval. If it is built, it will not only facilitate the transport of Yellow River engineering materials, but also be used to transport commercial goods and passengers, developing the economy, which is especially beneficial. At ten o'clock, they entered the Xiaoqing River. Although the mouth was not as large as the Yellow River, it was also boundless. On both sides of the steamboat's route, fishing boats were lined up, with fishing nets arranged on poles, stretching for several li, taking advantage of the rising tide to set the nets and waiting for the tide to fall to catch fish. Wherever the fishing nets were located, the water was yellower. After traveling further, silted land had been exposed on both sides, and the boat stopped on the land, indicating that the tide had receded. After traveling more than ten li, the body of the Xiaoqing River began to appear, only two or three hundred meters wide. The mud on both banks was yellow, with reeds growing. According to people on the boat, this place used to be barren, but in recent years, the Yellow River water has invaded south, depositing silt, and only then has yellow mud appeared, allowing plants to grow.</p>
<p>Arriving at Yangjiaogou, Disembarking</p>
<p>At twelve noon, they arrived at Yangjiaogou and immediately landed. Song Xianzhang, magistrate of Shouguang County, and Ma Changling, director of the Water Police Bureau, led people from all walks of life to welcome them. After Han got out of the car and rested at the Water Police Bureau, he went outside to summon civil servants and the masses to give a speech. At two o'clock in the afternoon, they switched to cars and set off. At 3:40, they passed outside the city of Shouguang County. Han got out of the car to inspect, and found several civil servants who were not wearing cloth gowns, violating provincial orders. He recorded their names for reprimand. Then he got back in the car and set off. At five o'clock in the afternoon, they arrived at the Qingzhou train station. Ning Chunxiao, the brigade commander of the 64th Brigade, and Yang Jiuwu, the magistrate of Yidu County, welcomed them outside the station. After Kong and Han got out of the car, they first went to Fulin Pond to bathe, then had dinner at the Lu Da Company, and then boarded a special train heading west, not stopping at any station along the way. They arrived in Jinan at 12:10 midnight. The estuary inspection ended here (20th).</p>
<h3>Korean Rogues Peddling Contraband in Bengbu; Serious Impact on the Sugar and Yarn Industries; Public Security Bureau Detains Three and Sends Them Out of the Country</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly rampant. Contraband goods are pouring in and being sold at dumping prices. Bengbu is the center of distribution for the sales in various parts of northern Anhui. Since Korean rogues came to Bengbu to peddle goods, smuggled sugar, rayon fabrics, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other goods have been transported in continuously, with a value of several hundred thousand yuan. Unscrupulous merchants seek only profit and are happy to associate with the rogues, doing their best to help with sales to reap profits, so that foreign contraband goods are flooding the market. Other tax-paid goods are squeezed out invisibly. Among them, the sugar industry has been the most affected. The sugar sold in Bengbu is usually British Taikoo cane sugar, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and other types. In the past, the market price was over twenty yuan per dan. Since smuggled sugar has been sold in Bengbu, the thirteen sugar companies in the Sugar Industry Association, stockpiling various types of sugar, have only sold three to four hundred yuan per day. The market price of smuggled sugar is only sixteen yuan per dan, six to seven yuan cheaper than taxed sugar. According to people in the Sugar Industry Association, there are still more than 10,000 packages of taxed sugar in the city, totaling about 20,000 dan. If smuggled sugar continues to be sold at dumping prices, no one may be interested in taxed sugar, and the future of the sugar industry may be unimaginable. The impact on the cloth and yarn industries is also the same. The rogues in Bengbu also carry self-defense weapons. In addition to peddling contraband to unscrupulous merchants, they have recently been wandering the streets, giving red medicinal powder to passersby, claiming that it can treat headaches and epidemics. Citizens are afraid that it has some effect and dare not take it. The Public Security Bureau has been paying close attention to these people who have been coming in droves recently, fearing that they will stay in the country, hindering public order, and has decided to implement a crackdown. Yesterday, the police sent three Koreans to the station and put them on a train back to Tianjin. The rest will be dealt with in the same way. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the flooding of contraband goods not only affects national taxes but also hinders commerce. It convened a discussion meeting of the standing committees at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th to discuss ways to crack down on the influx of contraband goods and stop dumping. It is said that the resolution is to start with an investigation. Once the situation of contraband dumping is clear, they will decide how to deal with it and do their best to stop it. The people from all circles hope to persuade merchants to refuse to sell smuggled goods, send letters to various banks to stop accepting remittances and issuing loans for smuggled goods, send letters to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to do their best to assist in the seizure of smuggled goods, request the authorities to investigate and severely punish unscrupulous merchants who sell smuggled goods, and send a telegram to the central government to quickly formulate effective measures to stop smuggling, to block the source and maintain national taxes.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Prepares for Flood Control Along the Yangtze River: Appointing Yangtze River Flood Control Commissioners for Twelve Counties Along the River</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Anhui Provincial Government believes that the flood season is approaching and the Yangtze River water level is rising every day. To plan ahead, it has ordered the magistrates of the twelve counties along the Yangtze River, including Huaining, to be the flood control commissioners for the river levees within their respective county boundaries. The original order is as follows: "Recently, there has been continuous rain, and the Yangtze River water level has risen sharply. According to records, it has reached the central government's stipulated flood control period, and preparations should be started immediately to make plans. Based on the precedent of last year, the county magistrate is appointed as the flood control commissioner for the river levees within the county's boundaries. You are expected to conscientiously comply with the following matters: 1. Prepare flood control materials. 2. Appoint members to be responsible for organizing levee protection teams by section. 3. The newly built soil this year is most easily damaged. Once the water reaches the base of the levee, protect it in advance. 4. The previously issued flood control plan form should be filled out and submitted before the 15th of this month. 5. The county magistrate should often go to each levee for inspection. The above five points must be handled promptly and reported without delay." In addition, the Construction Department believes that the recent Yangtze River water level has exceeded the flood control line stipulated by the central government, and that a flood control committee should be established in accordance with past precedents to make plans. Jiang Shihui, Chen Yan, Qi Qun, Fang Junqiang, Ding Gongnan, Xu Shixiong, Wen Yi, and seven others were appointed as members of the committee, with Jiang Shihui, Qi Qun, and Ding Gongnan designated as standing committee members, and Huang Yingzhong as the secretary of the committee. They were all notified yesterday (May 19).</p>
<h3>Tan Zhuohong's Case Reopened Yesterday; Defendant Requests to Stop Detention Denied</h3>
<p>The case of Tan Zhuohong, a judge of the Shanghai District Court, and Yang Shaopeng, a lawyer, accused of fraud by means of a case, was reopened by the Wuxian Local Court yesterday (22nd) at 3:00 p.m. In addition to Tan's defense lawyer Wu Chaoli and Yang's lawyer Lu Dingkui, who had arrived at the court earlier, the witnesses summoned included lawyer Lu Jiajun, Wang Jiacheng, secretary of Sun Zuqi's law firm, Chen Fengming, Zhang Qidong, the party in the defamation case, Qin Zhengru, the owner of the Haizhou ship in the case of death by negligence, and Lin Dingchen, Wu Zhikuan, Qi Yougen, Zhao Deru, and Li Lin. Tan Zhuohong's wife still carried her child to the court to listen, and Yang's wife also went to Suzhou with Lu Dingkui. Tan and Yang, when brought from the detention center, were natural in their attitude. The criminal court president Yu Zhongxian first summoned Zhang Qidong for questioning. According to his testimony, he is 42 years old, from Wujin, and currently works at the Yangzheng School in Shanghai's Paifanglou. He previously filed a defamation suit against Song Dazheng, which was handled by Tan Zhuohong. Sun Zuqi was the lawyer I hired. The first hearing was on October 14. Because I planned to go to Japan to study physical education, I was deeply troubled by the delay in the case. I inquired with the lawyer and learned that Yang Shaopeng had contacted Sun Zuqi, saying that to handle the case, some small fees were required. This was on the 16th. According to lawyer Sun, he immediately refused sternly. Chen Fengming testified that he was a porcelain enamel worker. Because a relative had a lawsuit, he went to Sun Zuqi's office on October 16 last year. Just as they were discussing it, he suddenly saw someone asking to see Sun with a name card. Sun saw the card and seemed not to recognize him. Later, he extended the meeting to the reception room. When he returned to the office, his face was quite unnatural and he said, "This is outrageous!" I asked him, and he said that because he was handling a case, a lawyer named Yang Shaopeng came and said that Judge Tan had asked him to come and say that the evidence in the case he was handling (referring to Zhang Qidong's suit against Song Dazheng) was too weak. If he wanted to convict the defendant, he would need to take some money for contact. Sun Lawyer was still accompanied by Wang Jiecheng when he said this. Wang Jiacheng testified that he worked as a secretary at Sun Zuqi's law firm. Yang Dingchen introduced Zhang Qidong's case to Sun Lawyer. Yang Shaopeng came on October 16 last year. The rest is the same as Chen Fengming's testimony. Zhang Qidong also testified that later, because the case was delayed for too long and schoolwork was busy, he could not often ask for leave, so at the third hearing, he asked Judge Tan to expedite the conclusion. As a result, I had no choice but to withdraw the lawsuit. Zhao Deru testified that he was the business director of Yunshang in Shanghai. In February last year, he sued Wang Bingnan for counterfeiting Liushen Pills and trademarks in the Shanghai District Court. I went to the hearing three or four times. I don't know Tan Zhuohong, but this case was always handled by Tan. When the subpoena for the second hearing arrived, I was at Zhu Yisheng's law firm. According to Zhu, Yang Shaopeng had come to say that some small fees were required for this case. Whether these small fees were for Yang himself or for Judge Tan, I don't know. Next, witness lawyer Li Lin testified that Li Shirui was my late father, who passed away on March 17 this year. The Cheng Li Tianzhi case was about Cheng Linsheng's wife, a wealthy real estate merchant in Shanghai, suing Xu Yi for forging documents. The public fee was not specified. The incidental civil suit only requested that the forged documents of Xu Yi be returned and destroyed. The Shanghai District Procuratorate filed a public prosecution on June 22, 1935, and the verdict was reached in July, sentencing Xu to four months in prison. Later, Xu appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which declared him innocent. In June 1935, because my late father was spitting blood and not feeling well, he was sleeping in bed. Cheng Li Tianzhi wanted to hire another suitable lawyer, so my late father introduced Yang Shaopeng to handle it. My late father and Yang Shaopeng knew each other because my late father participated in an anti-Japanese group during the January 28 Incident and paid close attention to the coastal construction projects. At that time, he knew that Yang was from Jiangyin and was familiar with the Jiangyin Fort, so he inquired with Yang, and that is how they got to know each other. Moreover, Yang's office was on Dagu Road, only a mile away from our office, so he often came to our office. How my late father hired him to handle the Cheng Li Tianzhi case is unknown. When lawyer Yang was hired, Wu Zhiting, the Cheng family's bookkeeper, came to sign the contract, with a public fee of 4,000 yuan. However, I heard that when signing the contract, Wu Zhiting and Yang seemed to have a small dispute. It was heard that Wu wanted him to handle it satisfactorily and achieve good results, while Yang said that he could not take responsibility. As for whether Yang and Tan Zhuohong knew each other, I did not hear about it. However, Yang Shaopeng once said this kind of thing. Yang Shaopeng was re-examined again in court. Finally, Judge Yu questioned the defendant Tan Zhuohong, who denied knowing Yang Shaopeng and denied entrusting Yang Shaopeng to solicit bribes outside. As a result, after the clerk read the confession and each witness and defendant signed it separately, the court ordered that the case would continue to be heard and adjourned the court. The witnesses were ordered to return. Also, when the court finished, Tan and Yang were seriously ill and requested to stop the detention, which the court did not approve.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Chamber of Commerce and Residents Exempted from Forced Labor Criticized</h3>
<p>The county government previously received an order from the commissioner's office to build the Fengzhu Road to facilitate transportation, and built the road by means of forced labor. The districts of Songjiang and Jinshan counties were ordered to investigate and create a list of conscripted workers, survey the route, and calculate the methods of assigning work. All of this was submitted and approved. Since construction began, the conscripted workers have been enthusiastic. However, some merchants in Jinshan said that being conscripted for road construction hindered business and they were unable to pay for labor substitutes. Therefore, Zhu Youlu, chairman of the Jinshan County Chamber of Commerce, submitted a request to the administrative inspector and commissioner's office, requesting relief measures. The commissioner's office replied, stating that conscripting labor to build roads is a national duty that citizens should fulfill, and that they should not shirk it with excuses. The Chamber of Commerce does not understand the big picture, which is very distressing. They are still ordered to supervise the conscription to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Wealthy Gentleman Zhang Yuejie's Inheritance Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Zhang family in Yingchunfang, Loumen, is a prominent family in Suzhou. Zhang Yuejie was known as the richest man during his time. After Zhang Yuejie passed away, his fourth son Zhang Hebo also died. Hebo had a concubine, Chen, who gave birth to a son named Yixin. Because Zhang Hebo's wife, Zhang Yao Shuhui, denied that he was Hebo's son, Zhang Yixin hired lawyer Xu Tongyin to file a lawsuit in the Wuxian District Court, requesting Zhang Yao Shuhui to confirm the relationship between mother and son. After three trials, Zhang Yixin won the case. Therefore, he further requested the allocation of 50 yuan of property, and also won the case. He immediately obtained the court's approval to implement a provisional attachment on a residence in Yingchunfang (the house has a garden worth more than 100,000 yuan). Yesterday (22nd), Judge Chen of the District Court summoned both parties and opened an execution hearing, possibly auctioning off the house. However, Hebo's three older brothers will come forward to raise objections, it is said.</p>
<h3>Provincial Chamber of Commerce Requests Ministry to Preserve Old Copper Coins</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, considering that since our country changed its subsidiary currency, the China, Central, and Communications Banks in various regions were ordered to collect copper coins, with the aim of gradually reducing old currency and gradually promoting new currency, but for half a year, various new subsidiary currencies have still failed to expand and promote. Although Wuxian is close to Shanghai, there are very few subsidiary currencies in circulation on the market, and it still relies on the existing copper coins to meet the market demand. Moreover, under the current situation, before the new subsidiary currencies are mass-produced, the existing copper coins should be temporarily retained to avoid panic about subsidiary currencies, which would hinder the livelihoods of the weak and small people. Therefore, it urgently proposed to the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, requesting it to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance to instruct various banks to notify their branches that the new subsidiary currencies should be exchanged for sealed copper coins. Before a large amount of new subsidiary currencies can be received, the old copper coins should be temporarily preserved in the local branches so that when a panic occurs in various places due to a shortage of subsidiary currencies, the sealed copper coins can still be issued and exchanged at any time to provide relief. When the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors in Zhenjiang on the 21st, Cheng Ganqing, chairman of the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, considered the matter important and made a special trip to the province to attend. Chairman Cheng returned to Suzhou on the 22nd. According to reports, the proposal has been approved by the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce and will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance immediately, requesting additional casting of two-and-a-half new subsidiary currencies to alleviate the currency shortage and benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Sun Honglin Visits Wuxi to Inspect Judicial Affairs</h3>
<p>Sun Honglin, Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court, recently went to various counties to inspect the status of judicial matters. Sun, accompanied by Qian Sen, President of the Fourth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and concurrently President of the Tongshan District Court, arrived in Wuxi on the morning of the day before yesterday. After arriving in Wuxi, they went straight to Meiyuan, Yuantouzhu, Xiaojishan and other places to tour. They stayed at the Taihu Hotel that night. Very few people outside knew about it. Yesterday (22nd) at 7:00 AM, Sun, accompanied by Qian Sen, took a public bus from Meiyuan to Ximen, first went to the Wuxi Fifth Prison to inspect it. Prison Warden Xing Yuantang welcomed them inside to inspect various facilities and cell blocks. Then they went to the District Court for inspection, where they were greeted by President Cui Yun Gong. After the inspection, President Cui and others escorted them to the station, where they took the 12:21 express train to Changzhou to continue the inspection.</p>
<h3>Major Case of Swindled Steel Balls Cracked</h3>
<p>The Lida Steel Ball Bearing Company on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession of Shanghai is the sole distributor of British "ESIA" brand steel ball bearings. On September 7th of last year, Lu Yousheng designed to defraud them of 117 large and small steel balls, worth 1,894 yuan. The company reported the case to the French Concession Police for investigation. Recently, the company learned that Yu Shunqi, owner of the Yingchang Hardware Store in Huinong Bridge, Wuyi County, had a large collection of steel balls. Therefore, the business manager He Xin Fan was sent with Xu Guilin, an investigator from the French Concession Police, to Wuxi to report to the Public Security Bureau and request assistance in the investigation. Director Chen received the report and immediately sent Wang Bingsheng, a detective captain from the Detective Team, to the Yingchang Hardware Store for a search. Thirty-four pieces of stolen goods were found. According to the store owner Yu Shunqi, the steel ball bearings were consigned by someone else. Yu Shunqi, along with the stolen goods, was taken to the bureau for temporary detention, pending extradition to the Shanghai court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wujiang: Jiahu Highway Opens Regularly</h3>
<p>The Jiahu Highway (the highway from Pingwang Town in this county to Huzhou, Zhejiang Province) was built by the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province and has been completed. The Zhejiang Highway Office previously test-drove the highway, and the result was very satisfactory. It has now been handed over to commercial management. The road has been scheduled to open for business on June 1st. However, the station houses along the way have not been built yet. Land is being surveyed and workers are being hired to build them. From now on, transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will be more convenient.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Bank President Punished for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Chen Herong, the former president of the Changshu Farmers Bank in this county, embezzled more than 30,000 yuan of bank funds during his tenure and fled. After being apprehended in Suzhou by the county government of this county, Gao Chao, Chen was transferred to the Zhenjiang District Court for trial. The trial has now concluded. Chen Herong was sentenced to four years in prison for embezzlement and dereliction of duty. Chen declared in court that he was not satisfied and has appealed to the High Fifth Branch Court.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Impersonating an Internal Secretary Arrested</h3>
<p>Recently, Chen Dasan (also known as Chongping, from Jiancheng, Jiangsu), who claimed to be a Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Interior and an employee of the Sino-Belgian Gengkuan Committee, specialized in swindling money from officials of various departments and offices of the Provincial Government by falsely claiming his identity. Many people have been deceived. On the 19th, he went to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, presented a card, and visited Director Hui Jin. After the conversation, Chen suddenly asked to borrow two dollars to use as travel expenses back to Beijing. Hui became suspicious, politely refused, and secretly sent Officer Lin to follow him in plain clothes to investigate his whereabouts. At the same time, he asked various places whether they knew him. Chen's so-called friends all replied that they did not know him. Hui then determined that he was undoubtedly using a false identity to collect money and immediately asked the General Bureau for instructions. Dozens of old appointment letters and two letters from Ye Chucang and Cai Yuanpei were found in his briefcase. Based on the correspondence addresses on the letters, dozens of business cards with the official title of Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Interior were found at No. 9 Wumiao in the city, as well as opium lamps, guns, and other items. Chen's concubine, Chen Hua, was also taken to the bureau and then sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. Hui Jin sent a letter to Jiang Zuobin in the name of a training school student and received a reply: "Director Hui of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Capital: I have read your letter. There is no Chen Dasan in the Ministry's staff. It is clear that he is using a false identity to swindle. Please investigate according to the law and report to the Ministry of Interior." (21st)</p>
<h3>Nantong: Conscripting Labor Along the River to Strengthen Dikes for Flood Prevention</h3>
<p>The fields along the river in southwestern Nantong are collapsing into the Yangtze River, forming a moving collapse. The villagers have petitioned the Party and government agencies. The county government is now conscripting labor to rush to build dike projects to prevent major floods. The construction bureau is hiring workers to deal with the gaps and retreat and to build stone embankments to rescue the river banks.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Trial Opens Yesterday in Son Imprisonment Case for Property</h3>
<p>Zhang Fuxian, a local bully from Liangzhu Town, Hangxian County (also known as Qingxiang), whose older brother died early, leaving behind more than 20,000 yuan in property, and only one nephew Mao Song, it is said to be his biological son, was adopted as his brother's heir. He is now 38 years old. After graduating from Anding Middle School in Hangzhou, he studied at Aurora University in Shanghai. In 1925, he went to Guangdong to seek employment but failed. After returning home, he lived idly. Zhang Fuxian, in order to seize his property, imprisoned Mao Song in a dark room in November 1928, claiming that Mao Song was suffering from mental illness. Mao Hua had escaped several times but was caught and brought back. Therefore, the imprisonment became more severe. His hands, feet, neck and other parts were put in very heavy shackles. It has been more than eight years since then. Recently, lawyer Yao Xiheng learned of this and reported it to the court. The court sent bailiffs to Liangzhu to rescue Mao Song from danger and sent him to the detention center for a forensic examination, which proved that he had no mental illness. The Hangzhou District Court summoned the defendant Zhang Fuxian and Chen Shougen (representing Zhang Chengqing), a clerk from the Liangzhu Township Office, for interrogation at 2:00 PM yesterday (22nd). Zhang Jisong was first summoned to detail the pain of being imprisoned for eight years, which lasted for an hour. Then the witnesses and Zhang Fuxian were summoned. Zhang insisted that Mao Song was his biological son and denied that he was his uncle. The judge said that the case still needs to be investigated and witnesses need to be summoned, so he ordered Zhang Fuxian to post a written bail of 2,000 yuan. Mao Song's body was too weak and was taken away by a lawyer for recuperation.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: County Chief Seals Civil Newspaper Office</h3>
<p>Mao Qi, the director of the Pinghu Minbao newspaper, was summoned and detained by the county chief yesterday, and was prohibited from seeing guests. The reason for the arrest is unknown. The office was also closed by the county government, so it has been suspended from today (21st). The newspaper had been registered with the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, and has been published for several years.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Crushing Testicles Leads to Death</h3>
<p>Tong Zhengkun, a resident of No. 41 Gaosheng Lane, Dongmen, Jiaxing (from Nanjing, 41 years old, works as a staff in Longquan Bathhouse), his son Hesheng, was fiddled with by Zhu Kunyuan (from Shaoxing, 16 years old) at around 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Tong caught a glimpse and stopped them, but Zhu was unreasonable and punched Tong. Tong also raised his hand to fight back. Zhu then grabbed and held Tong's testicles tightly. Tong cried out in pain and fell to the ground, his face changed, and he died immediately. The murderer was caught by someone and sent to the Guanyinge Police Station for detention. Then the deceased's wife, Chen, reported to the court, and the prosecutor's office sent officials to examine the body. It was learned that the deceased had three sons and a wife, and they all depended on him for their livelihood. The situation was very pitiful.</p>

<h3>Enhancing Sino-American Friendship: Sino-American Trade Week Concludes; Grand Celebration Banquet Last Night; Over Two Hundred Government Officials and Businessmen from Both Countries Participate; Mayor Wu Gives Extensive Speech on Sino-American Relations; Bei Songsun Delivers Speech on Trade Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Trade Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, in order to develop Sino-American trade, held a Sino-American Trade Commemoration Week from the 17th to the 23rd. Yesterday was the last day. They had a luncheon for Chinese and American students studying abroad, and Mayor Wu attended and delivered a farewell speech. A grand banquet was held in the evening, exchanging speeches by radio without charge between the two countries, which was a grand event. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech at Students' Luncheon: From 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM yesterday, the Sino-American Trade Association and the American Chamber of Commerce jointly hosted a luncheon at the American Club on Fuzhou Road for this year's Chinese students studying in the United States and American students returning to their country to study. Present were the hosts Bei Songsun and Miao Zhongxiu, acting presidents of the Sino-American Trade Association, Franklin, Haas, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, and members and guests of the associations, Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city, American Commercial Counselor Arnold, all the Chinese and American students studying abroad, and members of the American Junior Chamber of Commerce. Mayor Wu delivered a farewell speech on the spot, the speech is as follows: "Ladies and gentlemen, students, for the past three years, I have often had the opportunity to address many groups of students studying abroad. However, it has always been limited to our own students. This grand event allows me to talk with American students, which makes me feel even more happy. I sincerely wish you a pleasant journey, good health, and a happy spirit. I wish you a successful return to your country as soon as possible. I remember last summer, I earnestly urged the students studying abroad not to forget the responsibility of 'student ambassadors,' because the mission of students studying abroad is not only to seek advanced studies and technical training, but also to bring the inherent civilization of China with them to promote the spirit of the motherland. Today, I reiterate my previous request, hoping that you will make the same efforts. The reason why Chinese youth travel across the ocean to study abroad is nothing more than to seek deeper academic knowledge and prepare to serve the country in the future. This ambition is commendable. However, serving the country does not necessarily require returning to the country after completing your studies. You can still do your best during the preparation period. If you study diligently overseas and strive to express the spirit of the Chinese people, making people of friendly countries spontaneously admire you and win glory for the motherland, it is also a way to serve the country. As for the American students returning to your home country to study, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my humble sincerity. You have lived in our country for a long time, and you must know and understand our country's cultural thoughts, customs, and living habits very well. I hope that we can maintain sincere friendship with each other and convey the goodwill of our people to your countrymen to promote the good relations between the people of China and the United States. This is what I deeply hope for."</p>
<p>Celebration Banquet Attendees: At 7:30 PM in the evening, the association and others held a grand celebration banquet at the American Club, hosted by Sino-American and Howard. On the Chinese side, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Industry Liu Weizhi, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance Zheng Lai, Director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications Wen Yuqing, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Public Security Bureau Cai Jinjun, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, leaders from all walks of life Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Xinliu, Yuan Ludeng, Mu Ouchu, Zhao Jinqing, Liu Zhanen, Li Zhaohuan, Yan Fuqing, Pan Guangjiong, and others, more than eighty people. On the American side, Consul General to Shanghai Goesch, Commercial Counselor Arnold, Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, Silas, and leaders from American industry, commerce, banks, and all walks of life in Shanghai all participated, reaching more than one hundred and fifty people. Over two hundred people from both sides gathered together.</p>
<p>Movies Add to the Fun, Exchange of Radio Broadcasts: The banquet began at 8:00 PM, and movies were shown starting at 9:15 PM to add to the fun. One was an American detective news film, "The Lindbergh Kidnapping Trial," and the other was a Chinese construction news film, "The Yuehan Railway Project." At 11:00 PM (Shanghai time), they listened to the radio speeches delivered in Washington by Sheppley, president of the National Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and Mosa, director of the Far East Division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, at the invitation of American Commercial Counselor Arnold, specially to celebrate Sino-American Trade Week. The connection of currents between the two countries was achieved through several trials, directly delivered to the American Club by the International Radio Station and the Shanghai Telephone Company. After listening, at 11:15 PM, Mayor Wu and Mr. Bei Songsun of our country successively gave radio reply speeches to the United States (speeches see below). The lively Sino-American Trade Week came to an end until 12:00 PM late at night when everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Mayor's English Radio Speech: Mayor Wu gave a radio speech in English, which translated as follows: "Gentlemen of the Sino-American Trade Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Mr. Bei Songsun, acting president of the Trade Association, and Mr. Franklin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, co-chair, Mr. Miao Zhongxiu and Mr. Xia Peng, general managers of the Sino-American Trade Association, and Mr. He, secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce, ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the American Chamber of Commerce and the Sino-American Trade Association are holding this grand banquet to commemorate Sino-American Trade Week. I am honored to participate in this event. At the same time, I am even more pleased to be able to exchange views and express our friendship with the Minister of Commerce and the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Washington by wireless telephone. First, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere respect to the people of our friendly country, the United States, on behalf of the people of Shanghai, and wish you the greatest success and development. As for other parts of China, although no special representatives have been sent to participate, I believe that their friendship is the same. China and the United States have had friendly relations for 150 years. Tonight, people from both China and the United States are gathered here in Shanghai to celebrate each other. In addition to participating in person, I also express my sincere congratulations. The fallacy that 'East and West can never meet' has long lost its factual basis. The grand event tonight proves that not only have people from the East and West gathered together, but they have also shaken hands and talked happily, like family members. Although separated by thousands of miles of ocean, it cannot stop our friendship. However, the reason why Sino-American relations have reached today's friendship is not just because of banquets or empty words. There is a real reason for it that can lead to today's good results. Taking the Sino-American trade issue that we are commemorating tonight, the situation is satisfactory, and the achievements of mutual efforts over the years are sufficient to consolidate the friendly relations between the two countries. Today, what China needs from the United States are machine-made goods, such as scientific machines. However, Chinese raw materials are also indispensable to the United States. In the near future, China will also be able to export a large amount of manufactured goods. Therefore, Sino-American cooperation, just in terms of business relations, is very possible. Although the two sides of the Pacific Ocean are far apart, if Chinese and American businessmen can work together to develop trade, the success of the future will surely amaze us. We in Shanghai will actively prepare to realize our hopes. Tonight, I am honored to offer my humble words, and I respectfully ask you to jointly wish the Sino-American Trade Association success."</p>
<p>Bei's Speech on Sino-American Trade: Mr. Bei Songsun's radio speech, in essence, stated that although China and the United States are separated by the ocean, they are very close due to the progress of transportation. For example, we can now listen to radio speeches from the United States, and at the same time, the United States can also listen to our speeches and talk to each other. This is evident. The countries of the world are also becoming closer due to the convenience of transportation, hoping to help each other. Now I will talk about my feelings about China and the United States. Trade between China and the United States dates back to before the independence of the United States, but it has gradually developed since the independence of the United States. In the past two years, mutual progress has been made. According to the statistics of the customs trade register, China's imports and exports to the United States rank first. The development phenomenon is like this. However, the reasons are nothing more than two points: 1. Since the United States has history, for 150 years, the friendship between the two countries has been harmonious. The United States has no territorial intentions towards China and has always supported our country at various international conferences. It has established schools, hospitals, Red Cross societies, and other charitable undertakings in China, and has sponsored our country's education, health, and implementation, gaining the goodwill of our people, causing our people to be happy to buy American goods. 2. Our country has a culture with thousands of years of history, and the United States is an emerging country with extremely developed new civilization. Due to the world trend and environmental relations, our country has to undergo new changes. Therefore, the new culture of the United States has been absorbed, such as improving agriculture to increase production and improve farmers' purchasing power, improving industry to increase production, supplying the country on the one hand, and exporting to foreign countries on the other, while needing to import foreign materials, such as developing railways, opening up highways, and rivers to complete the national transportation. International trade will naturally expand, because transportation is convenient. Furthermore, if the people's lives are improved, new-style buildings, sanitary equipment, etc., all kinds of improvements, are all hoping that the United States will give us assistance and supply materials. The exchange of goods between our two countries, what our country needs, is purchased from the United States, and what the United States needs, is purchased from our country. There is no conflict in supplying each other's needs. Trade between the two countries does not need to be paid for in gold, and can be bartered. There is a lot of undeveloped wealth in our country, and the population is large, which is an important market for international trade. I hope that the United States will buy more Chinese goods, and the purchasing power of China will also increase. The establishment of a branch of the Bank of China in New York this time is so that it wants to fulfill its responsibility as our country's international exchange bank and promote Sino-American trade.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Buys Up Remaining Spring Cocoons; Borrowing 5 Million Yuan; Using 3 Million Yuan in Public Bonds and Spring Cocoons as Guarantee; Loan Agreement Agreed Upon and Signed in Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Control Committee, after handling the registration of silk factories and remaining cocoon merchants in the spring of this year, although the registration was very enthusiastic, there was still a surplus according to the scheduled cocoon production in Zhejiang Province. In order to benefit the farmers, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang Shaoxiong, allocated 3 million yuan in Zhejiang Consolidation New Public Bonds and handed them to Zeng Yangfu, chairman of the committee, to contact various banks in Shanghai for a cocoon-collecting loan. At the same time, a spring cocoon-collecting committee was organized to host it.</p>
<p>Loan Successful: Zeng Yangfu, chairman of the committee, was unable to come to Shanghai to contact various banks due to official business in Beijing. He specially telegraphed Standing Committee member Wu Shenbo to contact on his behalf. Wu contacted Song Hanzhang, general manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, general manager of the Bank of Communications, yesterday and reached an agreement. The total loan amount was 5 million yuan in national currency, of which 3 million yuan was assumed by the Bank of China and 2 million yuan was assumed by the Bank of Communications, with 3 million yuan in Zhejiang Consolidation Public Bonds and all collected cocoons as collateral. The interest rate was 9%.</p>
<p>Signing the Contract: After Wu Shenbo negotiated with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, he telegraphed the Zhejiang Silk Control Committee in Hangzhou yesterday, requesting it to withdraw funds from the Hangzhou branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications at any time. The loan term is six to eight months. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Wu Shenbo last night. According to him, the loan of 5 million yuan is a fact and has been successful.</p>
<h3>Poisoning Shanghai: Horrifying... The Usage of Acetic Anhydride is Increasing Daily; Heard... The Smoking Method is Novel and Difficult to Quit</h3>
<p>The China Press said that a telegram from Geneva reported that according to the report of Mr. Fowler, the American representative of the League of Nations' Opium Prohibition Committee, there are factories in Shanghai that manufacture acetic anhydride (used to make heroin), which can produce 250,000 units of this drug annually. According to sources in charge yesterday, the use of heroin in Shanghai is increasing daily, which is shocking. The cheap price is unprecedented. Because it is convenient to smoke, many people are addicted to it. It can be mixed with tobacco, which is not easy to detect. Moreover, it can be bought in many small alleys. A small amount can be bought for two small oceans to relieve the craving. The price of pure quality is 18 to 20 yuan per ounce, which is also an unprecedentedly low price. It is easy to carry. Although the authorities are trying to search and arrest, they cannot stop it. There are three methods of using it: injecting with a needle, inhaling through a tube, and the most popular is to put a small amount on the cigarette head and smoke it. Many people in Shanghai and elsewhere are addicted to it. According to doctors, it is extremely difficult to quit after becoming addicted. It is heard that many foreigners are also addicted. It is now known that a large factory for manufacturing heroin is being built in Tongzhou, where the pseudo-autonomous government of eastern Hebei is located. A large amount of alcohol is being smuggled in for the purpose of manufacturing the drug.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, accompanied by Zou Lin and Xu Kan, took a flower car last night and boarded the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Four Local Organizations: Telegraph the Government to Strictly Suppress Smuggling; Support the Proposal Not to Reduce Tariffs</h3>
<p>Four organizations in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association, discussed measures to deal with the issue of smuggling in North China yesterday. After discussion, they decided to issue a telegram supporting the government's decision not to reduce tariffs and requesting strict suppression of smuggling. The telegram is recorded as follows: "To the National Government of Nanjing, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, the issue of customs smuggling is extremely serious, as it relates to national tax revenue and the national economy. Recently, we read in the newspapers that the government advocates that tariffs should not be reduced in order to maintain national products. The industrial and commercial circles are gratified and unanimously support this proposal, hoping that it will be consistently implemented. At the same time, we appeal for strict implementation of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Evasion of Customs Tariffs passed by the Central Political Conference, so that smuggled goods will disappear and tax revenue will be restored, and the national economy will not be devastated again. The country is fortunate. We urgently express our views and beg for your attention. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Local Association, Shanghai Banking Association, Shanghai Money Trade Association."</p>

<h3>National Goods Factory Association Seeks Opinions on Preventing Smuggling: Members Suggest Exchanging Tax Receipts for Export Tax Rebates; President Chiang Responds to the National Goods Association That Preventive Measures Are Already in Place</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association, based on member suggestions, is working to prevent smuggling by exchanging tax receipts for export tax rebate certificates. Yesterday, it sent letters to various sectors to solicit opinions. The China National Goods Maintenance Association requested strict anti-smuggling measures and yesterday received a reply from President Chiang stating that he had instructed the relevant authorities to prepare preventive measures. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>President Chiang's Reply to the National Goods Association</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association believes that rampant smuggling in North China not only affects national tax revenue but also encroaches on the national goods market, which is detrimental to national rights. Therefore, it telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting them to promptly devise effective methods and strictly order all relevant authorities to investigate and crack down on smuggling to protect national rights and maintain national products. It is now known that the Association has received a reply from President Chiang of the Executive Yuan. The original text reads: Executive Yuan Instruction No. 559, according to the telegram stating that smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly rampant and requesting effective methods to be devised promptly and strict crackdowns to be carried out, the telegram has been noted. Regarding smuggling in North China, the relevant departments have been instructed to prepare preventive measures to be implemented soon. This is for your information. [Signed] President Chiang Chung-cheng.</p>
<p>Five Proposals for Preventing Smuggling</p>
<p>Zhou Shixuan, representative of the Qinkong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a member of the National Goods Factory Association, sent a letter to the Association requesting it to forward to the Central Government a request for strict sanctions against the rampant smuggling in North China. The original text reads: Respectfully, since our industry has been suffering from the economic downturn, we have been in dire straits. Business is declining, and we are in a precarious situation. After racking our brains, we can find no solution unless there is a thorough rectification, and there is no hope of recovery. Tracing the cause, most of it is due to unscrupulous merchants transporting imported goods, evading customs duties, and dumping them in various ports. Genuine national goods are not being sought after. These merchants use fictitious business names, display signs reading "X Dyeing and Weaving Factory" or "X Weaving Factory," and purchase surplus cotton yarn tax receipts from various merchants and exchange them at the Consolidated Tax Bureau for simple cloth permits. Driven by greed, they deceive the authorities. The tax bureau is unaware and is often fooled. With the rampant smuggling in North China, recent news reports indicate that it has gradually infiltrated the concessions, causing great harm to our industry. At a time when all industries are declining, it is not easy to maintain ourselves, let alone suffer such a major blow. If these unscrupulous merchants are not stopped by some means, not only will our industry be completely ousted, but the national goods market will also be affected, and the harm will be immeasurable. I believe that your Association is the key to our industry, leading manufacturers and providing comprehensive protection. Standing in this situation, I feel threatened and cannot remain silent. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinions and propose the following measures:</p>
<p>1. All dyeing and weaving factories and cotton weaving factories in this city must register with the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. After the competent authorities verify that they are genuine, the Bureau of Social Affairs will notify the Consolidated Tax Bureau, which will then allow the cotton yarn tax receipts to be exchanged for simple weaving factory transport permits for distribution to various ports. Those without the above procedures will not be allowed to exchange transport permits.</p>
<p>2. Investigations of weaving factories must focus on verifying the number of looms installed and the amount of cloth produced daily (for example, each loom operating day and night can produce about 30 yards of cloth, approximately four bolts. Assuming that the entire factory has 100 looms, it can produce 12,000 bolts of cloth per month. This is based on electric looms as a standard. The output of wooden looms is only half that. By analogy, adjustments can be made for more or fewer looms). Based on the actual amount of cloth produced, the corresponding cotton yarn tax receipts will then be allowed to be exchanged for simple transport permits to facilitate transportation and sales. This will prevent unscrupulous merchants from underreporting production and selling smuggled imported goods.</p>
<p>3. Pure dyeing factories that do not have looms and only engage in dyeing for customers and wish to transport goods to other ports should not use cotton yarn receipts to directly exchange for simple transport permits at the tax bureau when shipping. They should only be allowed to exchange original cloth receipts for dyed cloth receipts to avoid the confusion of weaving and dyeing.</p>
<p>4. Some businesses operating in this port use the names of dyeing and weaving factories to sell imported goods, disguising them and selling them inland. This should be investigated and severely punished.</p>
<p>5. Inland weaving factories that have wholesale outlets in Shanghai are only allowed to transport goods to Shanghai using simple transport permits exchanged in their local area. After inspection and stamping by customs, they can then exchange them at the Consolidated Tax Bureau for continued transport permits. They must not directly exchange cotton yarn tax receipts to eliminate malpractices and gradually rectify the situation so that unscrupulous merchants have no way to start. Our national goods factories can be protected, and the industry can be slightly revitalized. I also request your Association to consider this matter carefully and forward it to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, instructing the competent authorities to promptly adopt effective measures and strictly enforce them. Government officials are making every effort to rectify factories and have repeatedly issued orders. I sincerely hope that your Association will strictly correct them to bring them into line. Our industry will be fortunate. I respectfully address this to Chairman Lu of the Shanghai National Goods Factory Association.</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions from Various Sectors</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association yesterday sent letters to more than 30 cotton weaving factories, including Guanghua, Daxing, Qinfeng, and Dafeng, seeking their opinions. The letter reads: Respectfully, on May 19 of this year, we received a letter from Mr. Zhou Shixuan, representative of the Qinkong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, proposing measures to rectify cotton yarn tax receipts and restrict the exchange of cotton cloth export tax rebate transport permits, requesting us to forward it to the Yuan and Ministries for approval and implementation. This was immediately submitted to the Standing Committee for deliberation. It was unanimously agreed that rampant smuggling in North China affects the entire industry and commerce and undermines national tax revenue. All merchants and people should work together to discuss practical and effective relief plans for the government to adopt. Mr. Zhou's proposal to rectify the export tax rebate transport permits for domestic cotton cloth is a crucial measure to rescue the industry and prevent businesses without looms from infiltrating. It should be forwarded to the government for adoption. However, regarding Article 3 of the original proposal concerning dyeing factories, it is true that there are many dyeing factories in Shanghai that do not have looms but are called dyeing and weaving factories. However, most large-scale dyeing factories not only dye for customers but also purchase domestic cotton cloth, dye, and finish it themselves, investing their own capital. This should be considered comprehensively. In the future, when dyeing factories purchase domestic gray cloth from a factory, they should use the factory's original yarn tax receipt as proof to exchange for cotton cloth export tax rebate transport permits at the Consolidated Tax Bureau. They must not purchase surplus cotton yarn tax receipts from the market to misuse and pretend to be the original, in order to restrict and prevent the smuggling of imported cotton cloth. However, how to identify the original yarn tax receipt and make the procedures simple and clear so that there are no malpractices remains to be determined. This matter concerns the overall plan of the dyeing and weaving factory industry. We hope that you will express your opinions and reply in detail as soon as possible so that we can review and determine a practical, effective, and fair method and submit it to the government for approval and implementation. Also, regarding Article 4 concerning cloth shops, there are also many cloth shops that invest their own capital and operate national special factory cloth. This should also be considered comprehensively so that the rectification of transport permits still implies that each can engage in their own business. We also hope that you will discuss practical measures for adoption. We are writing to you to investigate and reply in detail as soon as possible so that we can convene a meeting to review and formulate a relief plan and submit it for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>National Goods Consumption Association to Hold Regular Swearing-In Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Consumption Association held an executive committee meeting at its office yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. More than ten people attended, including She Xipin, Zheng Dongshan, Zheng Jianbo, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Youyun, Wang Jingdong, and Li Aokui. Li Aokui chaired the meeting, and Zheng Jianbo took the minutes. The meeting began as scheduled.

The case of holding a categorized publicity conference for national goods was discussed. It was resolved that (a) the promotion of national goods cigarettes would be promoted; (b) a frugal movement of wearing cloth clothing would be promoted. The case of appointing representatives to attend President Hu's memorial service was discussed. It was resolved that Li Aokui and Zheng Jianbo would be appointed as representatives. The meeting adjourned at approximately 3 p.m.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Specially Dispatches Representative to Guangdong to Pay Tribute to Hu; Li Hongwen Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Claims That Communists in Shanxi Province Have Been Completely Eliminated; Now Requests Central Government to Urgently Provide Relief of One Million</h3>
<p>Following the death of Chairman Hu Hanmin of the Central Standing Committee in Guangdong, in addition to the central government's special dispatch of representatives to the south to pay tribute, local standing committees have also dispatched representatives. Yan Xishan, vice-chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, specifically ordered his representative stationed in Beijing, Li Hongwen, to rush to Guangdong to participate in the tribute. Li received the order and arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, staying at the New Hotel on Tiantong Road. He boarded the President Tahu passenger ship of the Dala Company last night at 10 p.m. and rushed to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong. The ship set sail from Shanghai at 2:15 a.m. this morning. According to Li's conversation with a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency before his departure, the communists in Shanxi have now been completely eliminated. However, the disaster-stricken areas involve 40 to 50 counties, and the victims are crying for food. They are requesting relief from the central government. They are currently requesting an urgent relief of one million, and ordinary relief in the future will require several times this amount. President Chiang has instructed the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. I have contacted the Ministry of Finance several times, but no concrete agreement has been reached. After returning from northern Guangdong, I will continue to negotiate. I received an order from Director Yan yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) to represent him in Guangdong to pay tribute to Mr. Hu. I hurriedly came to Shanghai to board the ship. Director Yan has prepared many elegies and couplets, but because they were not delivered to me in time, they have been sent directly to Guangdong.</p>

<h3>Business Association Continues Loans: Approved Sums 16,200 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Trade and Industry Loan Review Committee held its 29th session at the Tianjin Road China National Goods Bank, with Tsai Tseng Chi chairing. Forty small loan applications were presented. After review, it was decided that one family will get the full loan, one family will get half, and 38 will be granted part of their request. A total of 16,200 yuan were granted. Eleven were rejected because their operations or use for the loan was not compliant, including cases where factory numbers were falsified. All decisions will be announced to the respective applicants. According to Ministry of Finance's regulations, the loans may not exceed 50% of capital and this rule has been widely publicized. Yet, reports of those falsifying capital and requests are numerous. In order to follow the Finance regulations, the association has rejected these applications. Factories should note that owners or managers should retrieve forms from the organization on Tianjin Road in order to clear up confusion in order to avoid rejection.</p>
<h3>Association of Stock Exchanges Actively Raises Money to Purchase Warplanes</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aeronautical Association is raising funds to purchase airplanes to present to the government to commemorate General Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday. Various parties have enthusiastically supported this cause, as detailed in previous reports. The committee received a letter from the Shanghai Association of Stock Exchanges stating that it deeply supports the purchase of airplanes to celebrate the birthday. A meeting was held on the 18th of this month at 4:00 PM, and it was decided to appoint Mu Ouchu, Zhang Weiru, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Gu Xinyi, and Xu Busun, along with the chairpersons of the five exchanges (Cotton Yarn Cloth, Gold, Securities, Flour, and Miscellaneous Grains), a total of 11 people, to form a committee to raise donations for the purchase of airplanes to celebrate the birthday. Their enthusiasm and support are commendable. The committee has sent a letter of thanks, requesting them to work hard to purchase one airplane and provide updates on the situation.

<p>The National Postal Workers' Union, after the closing of the Third Plenary Session, held its first executive meeting in the capital on March 26 to discuss the assignment of duties for the second session of committee members and the implementation of the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session. More than a month has passed since then.

It is hoped that the Central Government will consider it and reallocate it. As for the purchase of an aircraft for a birthday celebration, the union and postal workers across the country are very willing to contribute, but the method is still under discussion.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Stop Levying Local Surcharges on Domestic Dyes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance: On the 21st of this month, according to a letter from the Dachung Dyestuff Factory Co., Ltd., our factory's products have long been rewarded by the central government with tax exemptions. In the past, when selling to various provinces in the interior, whenever there were provinces that promulgated surcharges, they were always given preferential treatment and were uniformly exempted in order to practically maintain the products of emerging industries, for which we are deeply grateful. Recently, when goods were transported to Sichuan Province for sale last year, the local tax bureau of Sichuan insisted on collecting taxes at the same rate as foreign goods. Therefore, on September 23 last year, we submitted a presentation to the Sichuan Department of Finance, truthfully applying and earnestly requesting that the local tax bureau be ordered to exempt taxes, etc. After submitting the presentation, because it had not been approved for a long time, we continued to present an appeal on April 23 this year. Now we have received the Sichuan Provincial Government's Cai Zi No. 388 approval, which states: 'The presentation has been noted. After investigating this case, according to the company's previous presentation, this government notified the company on October 11 of last year that the presentation had been noted. This government has not approved the Ministry of Finance's consultation on whether local taxes and surcharges should be exempted for the first domestic dyes produced by the company and transported into the province. The requested transfer order should not be used.' This approval is on record. Now, according to the previous situation, we are still required to follow the previous approval. This approval is on record. After investigating, we have not received the approval from October 11 of last year until now. Now, according to the approval, tax exemptions are only permitted after the Ministry of Finance consults on record. Therefore, we are especially copying and submitting a copy of our factory's April 23 presentation to the Sichuan Department of Finance, which is attached to this letter. We respectfully request your review and verification, and transfer presentation to the Ministry of Finance, requesting approval to quickly consult the Sichuan Provincial Government, and immediately order the local tax bureau to allow the various dyes bearing the "Zhong" character trademark produced by our factory to be transported into the province, and uniformly exempt local taxes, in order to comply with the law, etc." It was delivered to the meeting. After investigating, the factory's products were specially approved for tax exemption by your department in accordance with the Industrial Encouragement Law, and its effect extends to the whole country. Now the Sichuan Provincial Government has not approved the consultation of your department, which is inevitably suspicious of shirking responsibility. According to the letter, we should cable your department for review and verification, and approve the company's products that have been approved for tax exemption, and send a copy to the Sichuan Provincial Government, requesting it to comply with the regulations and immediately stop levying taxes, so as to avoid discrepancies in government orders and to be fair. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows and briefly presents.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Investigates Domestic Timber</h3>
<p>In order to promote domestic goods and examine the effectiveness of domestic timber, the Ministry of Railways has specially dispatched Kang Huan and Cao Songnian, technicians from the purchasing committee, to investigate the state of domestic timber prices. Yesterday, they met with Ma Liang, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and inquired about everything in detail. Mr. Ma reported in detail on the origin, source, nature, identification, straightness, curvature, cracking, use, sales volume, transportation, price, length, yards, weights, and measures of domestic timber for research. In the past, the sleepers and vehicle wood used by the Ministry of Railways have always been imported.

<h3>Three Domestic Goods Organizations Host Farewell Banquet for Delegation to Siam and Invite Wang Ertao, Representative Attending the Power Conference</h3>
<p>The China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association, the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, and the Shanghai National Products Movement Federation, three organizations, hosted a joint banquet for the entire members of the delegation to Siam on the occasion of their imminent departure at 12:00 noon yesterday (the 22nd) at Zhengyi Society on the 7th floor of the Continental Department Store on Nanjing Road. At the same time, Wang Ertao, the Chinese representative attending the Third World Power Conference, was also invited. In addition to the head of the delegation to Siam, Ling Jidong, the deputy head, Lin Kanghou, and members Fang Zhizhen, Liu Dabei, Li Qijun, Ye Xiangfa, Liu Ling, Chen Zhongkan, Xiong Dansun, Ma Chaoyong, Huang Tianjue, Yang Donglin, Cao Yumin, Wang Zhixin, and Wang Ertao, the representative attending the World Power Conference, there were also Wang Xingyao, Pan Yangyao, Ren Shigang, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Zhenfang, Cai Shengbai, Fang Yexian, Li Kangnian, Ye Youcai, Dai Zhicheng, Gu Bingyuan, Wu Mei, Xu Yunnan, Gan Hanhui, Song Peidao, and more than 80 other people. Wang Xingyao, chairman, gave a speech, briefly stating the significance of the three organizations hosting a banquet for the delegation to Siam and the representative attending the Power Conference, as well as what is hoped of the delegation to Siam and Mr. Wang Ertao, the representative attending the World Power Conference. Next, Cai Shengbai gave a speech, mainly stating that China and Siam have never had a commercial treaty, and it is hoped that this trip by the delegation can promote the signing of a Sino-Siamese commercial treaty. Second, there is little contact between the industrial and commercial circles of China and Siam, and it is hoped that this trip by the delegation can make the Siamese people understand that China's domestic goods have made considerable progress in recent years, introduce new products to Siam, and hope that your country will promote continuous delegations from Siam to China for investigation in order to increase contact between the industrial and commercial circles of the two countries, etc. Next, Xiang Kangyuan gave a speech, reporting on the situation of overseas Chinese in Siam, and hoping that this trip to the South by the delegation can promote the signing of an equal and mutually beneficial Sino-Siamese commercial treaty, etc. Next, Pan Yangyao gave a speech, mainly stating that he hopes that you, the head of state, will pay attention to what kind of domestic goods are needed in Siam during this trip to Siam, how to improve the products sold in Siam, and can provide domestic goods factories with references for improving production when returning to China. Mr. Wang Ertao is an industrial expert. This time he attended the World Power Conference and passed through Soviet Russia. Regarding the development of Soviet Russia's industry in recent years, he can provide a detailed report when he returns for our reference. We advocate domestic goods, but the food that is necessary for the daily life of the people still needs to be imported, with 40 million imports every year, which cannot be said to be regrettable. This time, Cao Yumin of the Food Association is also going to Siam for investigation, and can make considerable contributions to China's food problem. This can be asserted, etc. Finally, Ling Jidong, head of the delegation to Siam, gave a reply, briefly stating that the delegation has two major missions for this trip to Siam. First, Siam has previously sent a delegation to China for investigation. International etiquette is reciprocal. The delegation's trip to the South is a reciprocal visit. There is no formal diplomacy between China and Siam. The delegation's trip to Siam can also be the initial stage of Sino-Siamese diplomacy. It is hoped that this will promote the friendship between China and Siam and resolve all outstanding issues between China and Siam. Second, to tell overseas Chinese in Siam that in recent years, the Chinese government has been doing its best to cope with national difficulties, and China's industry and commerce have made significant progress in recent years, so that overseas Chinese can understand everything about the motherland and open up overseas markets for domestic goods. Those present today are all leaders in the domestic goods industry. China has 400 million people. If they can completely use domestic goods, China can become a vast free market. If domestic goods factories can think big and think long-term, the future of the domestic goods industry is truly unlimited. We hope that the domestic goods industry can cooperate and collaborate. There are many industries in China that need to be developed, so there is no need to engage in meaningless competition with each other. Then the future of domestic goods is truly unlimited. Secondly, the foreign trade institutions of the domestic goods industry are not yet sound. There are many places overseas that need commodities, but many trade opportunities are lost because there are no suitable foreign trade institutions to introduce them. Now that this kind of trade institution has been organized, it is hoped that it will expand its organization in order to increase the strength of foreign trade. Finally, on behalf of the members of the delegation, I would like to raise a glass to wish you all good health and prosperous careers. Next, the deputy head of the delegation, Lin Kanghou, gave a speech on the process of organizing the delegation and the mission to Siam, paying attention purely to the two words "investigation" in order to provide references for improving diplomatic trade and other issues between China and Siam when returning to China in the future. Afterwards, Wang Erdi, representative of the International Power Conference, reported on the history of the organization of the International Conference and the situation of previous conferences. This time, he represented the Ministry of Industry to attend and hoped that when he returned to China, he would make considerable contributions to the use of power machinery by domestic goods factories. Finally, Chairman Wang Xingyao gave a reply, and at 2:30, the guests and hosts dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association officially issued a statement yesterday, stating that recently, the so-called Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce was found in the city, printing and distributing leaflets, slandering Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the former chairman of the association. After investigation, the association has no address and no name of the person in charge. The seal affixed on it was also not issued by the competent industrial and commercial authorities. The facts presented on the sheet are all framed. Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the former chairman of the association, led commercial transportation and served the society with impartiality and integrity, which is known to all circles at home and abroad. The rumors have not caused any damage. However, as the legal organization of industry and commerce in the city, the association should have a justified argument for this kind of malicious attack and action under the guise of the name of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, it was specially decided by the 91st Executive Committee meeting to issue a statement, hoping for public observation.</p>

After investigating, the association has always published the names of the candidates recommended by individual members and group members in the newspaper before each election, and sent them to the party and government authorities to send personnel to supervise the election on the due date. This session is also handled in the same way. Therefore, this statement is hereby issued for public information.</p>

<h3>Due to Dredging of Longhua Pier, Garbage Export in the City is Blocked</h3>
<p>The Dredging Bureau is dredging Longhua Pier because the river is silted up to facilitate transportation, which has resulted in the city's garbage being unable to be exported. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dredging Longhua Pier The Dredging Bureau has not dredged Longhua Pier for many years. Garbage boats pass through the area and fall into the water, gradually causing silting. Therefore, the river dredging work was carried out there a few days ago, cutting off traffic. However, except for a part of the garbage in Zhabei that is specially purchased by villagers from Yujidun and other places in Shanghai and transported out via the Suzhou River, a part of the garbage from the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Nanshi is transported out via Longhua Pier.</p>
<p>Exports are Blocked Due to the river dredging, garbage boats from all over the country cannot be imported, resulting in the city's garbage being unable to be exported. Originally, when there was a lot of cargo and few boats, the stored cargo would be piled up near the Longhua Naval Fleet Command. However, the Navy Department believes that when the weather is warm and the sun is shining, garbage is a material that, if left for too long, will generate heat and become dangerous, so it is being cracked down on. The garbage in the Hunan area of ​​Shanghai is even more panicked. Cleaners have stopped working because they cannot export the garbage. After discussion by the Health Bureau and other relevant agencies, a method was agreed upon to temporarily pile up the garbage on the shore and transport it out after the river dredging project is completed.</p>

<h3>Tight Security, Tense Situation: Judge Personally Inspects the Scene of the Japanese Sailor Incident</h3>
<p>Ye Haisheng Reenacted the Shooting at the Scene; However, Witness Hu Xianghe's Testimony Slightly Contradicted the Reenactment; Judge Xiao Continued to Investigate at the Yuegong Hotel and Other Locations; Ye Haisheng Shouted for Help as He Was Being Taken Away in a Prison Van</p>
<p>The case of Cantonese natives Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Yurong, who were accused of killing a Japanese sailor on Le'an Road on the night of November 9th of last year, has been repeatedly heard by the First Special District Court, as detailed in previous reports in this newspaper. Now, in order to clarify the true facts of the case, the court specifically arranged for a judge to inspect the scene of the incident yesterday afternoon for reference. At 2:05 PM yesterday afternoon, Ru Baoyi, the lawyer representing the police in the prosecution, accompanied Xiao Xiefen, the judge presiding over the case, Ding Chongnan, the court clerk, and bailiffs from the First Special Court.</p>
<p>They traveled by car</p>
<p>to the entrance of the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. By that time, the police had already dispatched a large number of Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives led by the Western-Japanese Deputy Inspector to implement security measures on Le'an Road and North Sichuan Road. The situation was unusually tense. A large crowd of onlookers was kept on the sidewalks by the detectives, so order was maintained. Judge Xiao first inspected the Toyo Gakudo (Eastern Studies School) and the entrance of Arui Lane (where, according to Ye Haisheng, Yang Wendao handed over the handgun) on North Sichuan Road. The police also brought Ye Haisheng, who was handcuffed to a Japanese detective. After getting out of the prison van, the judge ordered him to be taken to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Le'an Road and questioned him about</p>
<p>the circumstances of the incident.</p>
<p>According to Ye's account, "After Yang Wendao handed me the handgun at the entrance of Arui Lane, I walked across to the western sidewalk of North Sichuan Road and proceeded north to the intersection of Le'an Road, the place where we are now standing. I waited there for about half an hour. Then, I saw Yang Wendao approaching with a Japanese sailor. Yang signaled with his mouth, and I followed the sailor, turning into Le'an Road." The judge then ordered Ye to reenact the movements of the Japanese sailor. Ye then proceeded along Le'an Road, with the judge and others following behind. (The road is shaped like a bow, initially facing east</p>
<p>before changing</p>
<p>to north-south, and continuing straight to the Jiangwan Road intersection.) Ye stopped at the entrance of Le'an Lane, which runs north-south, saying, "I stood by the electric pole at No. 13 in the lane and fired one shot at Nakayama Hideo. At that time, the deceased was about eight or nine steps ahead of me. After firing the shot, I fled to the opposite side, the Fengle Lane area." The judge then ordered the witness Hu Xianghe to reenact what he had seen at the time. According to Hu, "That evening, I was going to the Japanese-owned Takaoka Laundry. When I was about to reach the entrance of No. 89, next door to Takaoka, I</p>
<p>heard a gunshot.</p>
<p>I then saw someone fleeing towards Fengle Lane. I immediately went forward to look and saw a Japanese sailor lying on the ground, his head facing west and his feet facing east. I then went to the Takaoka store to report the incident." The judge then ordered Ye to act out the escape, and ordered Hu to identify whether the person he saw fleeing was of similar build. Hu replied that he could not be certain, but he saw the person escape from behind the electric pole into Fengle Lane, while Ye claimed that he had escaped from in front of the pole. Judge Xiao then ordered Ye to continue reenacting the escape. Ye then turned from Le'an Road into the main lane of Fengle Lane (which runs straight from Le'an Lane to North Sichuan Road, with the various lanes of Fengle Lane on the right-hand side, each with a sign indicating the lane number, such as "South Seventh Fengle Lane"), turned into a</p>
<p>small lane on the opposite side,</p>
<p>then turned into a side lane on the right hand, and then crossed through the lane opposite South Fifth Fengle Lane, reaching the main lane of Fengle Lane. He said that was how he had escaped at the time. He said he threw the handgun between South Fifth and South Fourth Fengle Lane, opposite the police kiosk. A Western detective then provided a fake handgun, and Ye performed the action of throwing it under the kiosk. After the</p>
<p>reenactment,</p>
<p>Ye went straight from the main lane of Fengle Lane to the intersection of North Sichuan Road, saying that he had</p>
<p>escaped that way</p>
<p>at the time. The judge then asked where he had gone after escaping to North Sichuan Road. He replied, "To No. 3, Sanxing Lane, Qiu Jiang Road." The judge pointed out that in the two written confessions, he had stated that he had gone straight to Room 9 of the Yuegong Hotel. Now he said he had returned home. Where did he actually go? Ye then claimed that he had gone to the Yuegong Hotel. Judge Xiao considered that all the necessary questions about the circumstances of the incident had been asked of Ye Haisheng, and ordered him to be temporarily placed back in the prison van. At this point, Ye suddenly shouted for help. Judge Xiao asked him why he was shouting for help, but Ye did not explain. Judge Xiao then returned to Le'an Road</p>
<p>to the spot where</p>
<p>Nakayama Hideo was attacked. The Western Detective Chief Kraut pointed out that the location where the bullet casing was recovered was four feet four inches from the western edge of the steps, and the bloodstained bullet casing was found twenty-seven feet from the western edge of the steps. He then went to the intersection of North Baizi Road and Jiangwan Road, where Kraut reported that after the incident, a woman had reported to two Chinese police officers patrolling there that someone had been killed on Le'an Road. The two officers had inspected the scene, with one officer remaining on guard at the scene and the other officer going to the telephone booth to report to the police. After inspecting the scene, Judge Xiao returned to the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Le'an Road, across from the entrance to Yuqingfang, the location where the witness Zhang Caiyuan had claimed to have seen Jack Yang Wendao.</p>
<p>According to police officers,</p>
<p>Zhang Caiyuan had been notified to wait there, but he was not to be found. Detective Kraut then reenacted Zhang's account, saying that Zhang had come out of the main lane of Yuqingfang and had seen Yang Wendao at the Le'an Road intersection opposite Yuqingfang, around 8:30 or 8:40 PM. Judge Xiao, believing that the area had been thoroughly inspected, ordered an investigation to be conducted at Room 9 of the Yuegong Hotel. He then informed the relevant Public Security Bureau and ordered an officer to be dispatched to cooperate at Room 9 of the Yuegong Hotel.</p>
<p>Room No. 9</p>
<p>However, the tea server who had been on duty in that room on November 9th of last year had already left, so it was impossible to summon him for questioning. Judge Xiao then questioned Ye in the room about the circumstances of his visit to the room. According to Ye, he, Zhou Sherong, Jack, and another Korean whom he did not know had gone to the room at 8 PM that evening to wait for Yang Wendao. Before they had been there long, Yang had arrived, but without saying a word, he had left. The judge asked Ye why he had not immediately shot the deceased when he saw him at the intersection of Le'an Road, but had followed him for so long before</p>
<p>acting.</p>
<p>What was the reason? Ye replied that there was no reason. He was also asked who he had met in the room after the incident. Ye replied that he had seen Zhou Sherong sitting by the window. Zhou had asked him if the matter was settled, and he had replied in the affirmative. The judge then summoned Zhu Jinbiao, the No. 1 tea server, who stated that the room had been booked by Xia Chunjie. The judge asked if the tea server, Ying Tongqin, could be brought to court to testify next time. Zhu replied that he could be brought. Judge Xiao then ordered an investigation to be conducted at No. 71 Yongji Lane, Baizi Road, the former site of the Tongyi Association. Upon arriving there, a woman with the surname Zhu came out and stated that the Tongyi Association had indeed been located there, but they had only rented a courtyard room and the room behind the hall,</p>
<p>as well as a loft.</p>
<p>According to Ye Haisheng, the discussion about killing the Japanese sailor had taken place in the room behind the hall, which contained only three or four stools. The drawing of lots had taken place on a table in the hall. The judge asked, "Since you agreed on September 5th that you would draw lots to determine who would carry out the shooting, why did you not act until the 9th?" Ye replied that he did not know. Yang Wendao wanted to postpone it until the 9th. At this point, Judge Xiao considered the investigation to be complete and left by car, returning to the court at 4:10 PM. Ge Zhaoji, the lawyer for the defendant Yang Wendao, Tang Huaiqun, the lawyer for Zhou Sherong, and Zhang Zhirang, the court-appointed pro bono lawyer, were all present during the inspection.</p>
<h3>Reclaiming New Wasteland: Planting Sesame Offers Seven Advantages; China Oil Lamp Company Submits Memorandum to the Executive Yuan; Executive Yuan Orders Provinces to Experiment with Planting Sesame on Newly Reclaimed Wasteland</h3>
<p>The China Oil Lamp Company previously submitted a memorandum to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the provinces be ordered to plant sesame on newly reclaimed wasteland to increase oil production and plug the "leakage." The Executive Yuan forwarded it to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry for review. Considering that sesame is the best raw material for oil extraction, the Executive Yuan has ordered the provinces to experiment with planting sesame on newly reclaimed wasteland. The company's memorandum is recorded below. The company submits this memorandum, proposing that the National Economic Council be instructed to order the provinces to plant sesame first on newly reclaimed wasteland, in order to increase oil production and save the nation's economy. It has been found that China's kerosene imports, according to customs statistics, amount to a staggering 120 million yuan per year. The main use of kerosene is for lighting. The vegetable oil lamps manufactured and sold by merchants can burn various domestically produced vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, raw oil, tung oil, sesame oil, and cypress oil. They produce bright light, superior to foreign lamps, and are free of smoke and toxicity, preventing fires, saving oil, and are hygienic, safe, and economical, possessing all kinds of advantages. They have been examined and approved by the Ministry of Industry and granted a patent. Moreover, the Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government issued Instruction Letter No. 157, stating that the results of the experiment listed the advantages and offered generous encouragement. Furthermore, the Second Department of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government issued Notice No. 11, confirming that they were indeed excellent and should be promoted and rewarded. The merchants also believe that in the event of an international war, the supply of kerosene would be cut off, and the lights of every household would have no way to continue. Domestically produced vegetable oils are abundant everywhere, and using vegetable oil lamps would eliminate the concern about fuel shortages. This is especially important for national defense. Since the lamps were manufactured and sold, Chinese people have been eagerly purchasing them. If there is no interference from foreign oil merchants in the future, and they can be sold smoothly, then stopping the 100 million yuan leakage of kerosene, increasing the 100 million yuan of oil-producing agricultural products, and consolidating national defense can gradually be realized. However, the production of vegetable oil is also very important for this type of oil lamp. If oil production is not abundant, the price will be expensive, and the lamps will not sell well. If the lamps do not sell well, the huge leakage cannot be stopped, and it will be difficult to increase oil-producing agricultural products. Therefore, for the sake of the national economy, it is necessary to make both oil prices and lamp prices cheap. Based on the principles of supply and demand, it is necessary to make both the amount of oil and the amount of lamps abundant. The latter is the responsibility of the merchants, while the former cannot be done without government guidance and assistance. Recently, the merchants have paid close attention to the issue of oil production and have considered the planting methods of oil-producing plants, as well as soil, climate, and the export volume of oil production. Based on the research results, we have requested the Ministry of Industry to order the provinces to plant cypress trees everywhere and requested the National Economic Council to order the highway authorities of the provinces to plant cypress trees along the roads to extract cypress oil as fuel, all of which have been approved. Merchants recently read in the newspaper that your esteemed Council's National Economic Council and the Ministry of Interior have decided to cultivate wasteland in the provinces. We believe that although the planting of plants on newly reclaimed wasteland varies depending on climate and soil, planting sesame is the most suitable. We dare to present our humble opinions, requesting your esteemed review. It has been found that weeds can easily grow on newly reclaimed wasteland. If sesame is planted first, then according to experience, weeds can gradually be naturally eliminated without the need for manual weeding. This is the first advantage. Newly reclaimed wasteland is often barren. If other plants are planted, a large amount of fertilizer is needed, while planting sesame only requires a small amount of grass ash to thrive. This is the second advantage. Sesame seeds are small and more economical to sow than other plants, with lower costs. This is the third advantage. Sesame is easy to grow and is not afraid of drought or flooding, so losses are minimal. This is the fourth advantage. The oil yield of sesame is 50% to 60%, which is higher than any other agricultural product. This is the fifth advantage. Moreover, although the climate and soil vary throughout the country, planting sesame is always suitable. This is the sixth advantage. The oil extraction process is simple, and the residue can be eaten. This is the seventh advantage. It has also been found that in China's foreign trade, the net value of sesame exports in 1934 was 4,998,750 yuan, accounting for more than 0.9% of the total. In 1935, it was 16,577,554 yuan, accounting for more than 2.8% of the total. In the past two years, sesame exports have increased sharply, more than doubling, indicating that sales are becoming more and more prosperous. Considering the above, it seems that planting sesame first on newly reclaimed wasteland to increase oil production can not only supply domestic fuel but also increase export trade. We believe that since you took office, you have been reforming politics, starting anew with the people, and serving the country with impartiality and loyalty. Your esteemed reputation is highly regarded. You will surely be happy to adopt anything that benefits the people and promotes their well-being. We dare to request that you order the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Interior to instruct the provinces, and through them, the township chiefs and neighborhood heads, to order the consistent planting of sesame first on newly reclaimed wasteland, so that oil production can be abundant, leakage can be stopped, and the people's difficulties can be alleviated. If it is appropriate, we ask that you review and approve it. This is truly for the public good. Respectfully submitted to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Chen Zuyi, representative of the China Oil Lamp Company.</p>
<h3>U.S. Mobil Oil Merchants in Shanghai Appeal for U.S. Relief Due to the Influx of Illicit Oil; A Certain Party Refines Diesel Oil and Sells It Illegally in the North China Market; Request Prompt Curbing to Maintain the Original Position</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, China's kerosene market is almost entirely supplied by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia. In August 1933, Mobil Oil came forward to establish an agreement stipulating that Mobil's oil sales would account for one-third of China's total sales, with the remaining two-thirds to be divided equally among Asia, Texaco, and Oil Everywhere. They also agreed to raise prices uniformly. However, before long, Mobil's Old Brand oil sold particularly well, so they negotiated with the three companies to increase sales. Each company held its own views, and no agreement was reached. Mobil then lowered prices independently, followed by Texaco. Asia also competed fiercely with Mobil. After repeated negotiations, an agreement was reached to jointly purchase and sell, and Russian oil could not compete by lowering prices below the stipulated price. As a result, the Chinese kerosene market was entirely controlled by Mobil and Asia. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sales Volume in China</p>
<p>Regarding the sales areas of various oils, Mobil oil is sold in the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Hangzhou, and Yangtze River regions, as well as in North China. Asia oil is sold in Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and throughout the country. Texaco oil is sold north of Hankou. Previously, Mobil imported about one million tons per month into China. Asia imported about one million tons per month into China from the Dutch East Indies. Texaco has twenty oil tanks in Shanghai, each holding 50,000 tons of oil. The number of Russian oil shipments is relatively small. Recently, the import of kerosene from various countries has been less than before. In February, the total import was 23,414,600 liters, worth 1,042,229 gold units. Asia imported the most oil, with 13,957,041.8 liters, worth 640,159 gold units. Next was Mobil Oil, with 6,229,736 liters imported, worth 221,135 gold units. Soviet oil imported 1,315,576 liters, worth 56,759 gold units.</p>
<p>Price Comparison</p>
<p>Recently, Mobil Oil's Torch Brand is priced at 8.95 yuan per case, Old Brand at 9.15 yuan per case, and Sales Brand at 8.75 yuan per case. The Tiger Brand's prices vary in different markets. Asia's Yuanbin Brand is priced at 9.15 yuan per case, and Monk Hat Brand at 8.95 yuan per case. Texaco Oil's Happiness Brand is priced at 8.85 yuan per case, and Red Star Brand at 9.15 yuan per case. Guanghua Oil's Top Brand is priced at 9.15 yuan per case, and New Brand at 8.95 yuan per case.</p>
<p>U.S. Merchants Appeal</p>
<p>Since the smuggling incident in North China, kerosene from various countries has been severely affected. It has been heard that merchants from a certain country have purchased diesel oil from the Soviet Union, refined it into kerosene domestically, and resold it to our country. There have already been 4,600 cases landed at Puhekou, ten miles from Changli, and another 1,000 cases landed at Donglizhuang near Qinhuangdao. They have now been transported to Tianjin. A large number of shipments will continue to arrive on the coast of eastern Hebei. This kerosene is transported by the Changli Jidong Company and sold by the Jidong Company of Tao Xiaojie in the Tianjin Japanese Concession. Smuggled from Dalian to eastern Hebei, it only pays one-quarter of the normal customs duties, making a considerable profit. British and American merchants have been severely hit. It has been heard that Mobil Oil has appealed to the U.S. State Department in Washington, requesting assistance to maintain its original position.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Resumes the Municipal Investment Bank; Provides Residents with the Convenience of Investing in Municipal Government; Establishes a Stable and Reliable Resource for the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Chief of the Finance Department, has decided to reorganize the Municipal Investment Bank of the Shanghai Municipal Council. It has been found that this bank was closed after the sale of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Electricity Department in 1929. At that time, someone purchased the Electricity Department, and the proceeds from the sale were sufficient to meet all major needs, so the bank was closed. It has also been found that before 1929, the bank had a great function. On the one hand, it provided residents with various conveniences to invest in municipal bonds, and on the other hand, it provided the Shanghai Municipal Council with a stable and reliable resource. Therefore, when the Shanghai Municipal Council re-borrowed in 1934, there was a proposal to reorganize the Municipal Investment Bank. Unfortunately, the financial situation was extremely difficult at that time. The situation had not improved by 1935. However, recently, in view of the sales of municipal bonds this year, the authorities have decided to resume the bank. It is now stipulated that the bank will start operations on June 1 this year. The Municipal Bond Bank Group of the Finance Department will accept deposits, and an appropriate portion of each household's deposit will be used to purchase municipal bonds on May 5 and November 5 each year. The interest and deposit amount can be changed and announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council at any time. It is currently stipulated that the maximum deposit amount should not exceed 5,000 yuan, and the interest rate is temporarily set at 4.5%. Anyone wishing to invest in this bank can contact the Finance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council from the 1st to the 5th of each month.</p>
<h3>Engineers Freed After Being Abducted by Short-Clothed Men; Rescued and Returned by the Public Security Bureau; Kidnapping Said to Have Arisen from Business Disputes</h3>
<p>Xu Fugeng and Xie Huizhou, engineers at the Hezhong Steel Cable Factory at No. 10 Xujia宅, Huang与 Road, Yinxiang港, were suddenly kidnapped by twenty or thirty men in short clothes in four Southern Motor Company cars around 6 AM the day before yesterday. Afterwards, the Yinxiang港 Police Station and the Lao Zha Detective Room exerted great effort in their investigation and immediately arrested the suspect Chen Futang, the owner of the Helong Steel Cable Factory at No. 1 Caoantou, Pudong, and workers Zhang Miaosheng, Xu Xiaomao, and Zhang Qingsheng in Room 281 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Xizang Road. Details of the case were also reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that after the Yinxiang港 Police Bureau took Chen and others back into custody, they prepared a document and submitted it to the General Bureau. Under strict interrogation, Chen and others admitted to the kidnapping of Xu and Xie and stated that they were hiding Xu and Xie in Caoantou, Pudong. The General Bureau assigned detectives to go to Caoantou, Pudong, yesterday morning to rescue Xu and Xie and escort them home. As for the cause of the case, it is said to have arisen from business disputes, but this has yet to be confirmed. It is said that although Xu and Xie have been legally sanctioned by the police authorities for Chen Futang's harmful actions, they have suffered great mental distress and damage to their career prospects. Therefore, they will file a separate lawsuit according to law.</p>
<h3>Unable to Afford Marriage, Gathering a Crowd for a Forced Wedding Results in Imprisonment Before the Good Deed is Done</h3>
<p>Shen Axing, a tailor from Chongming and owner of Shuntaichang Tailor Shop at 899 Beile Road in the French Concession, is 31 years old. His parents are deceased, and he has a younger sister named Sanlang, who is 23 years old this year and works at Jiuyuan Sock Factory on Caishi Road. Four years ago, Shen arranged through his maternal uncle Hu Shuangxi as matchmaker to betroth his sister Sanlang to Xia Xuliang from Jiangyin (who is 26 years old this year and works at Jiufeng Enamel Factory on Peikai'er Road in the Public Concession). At that time, both sides exchanged wedding cards (commonly known as "pressing cards"). The following year, Xia sent a tea ceremony gift of 120 yuan (commonly called "sending the plate") and set the formal wedding date for March 16th of the previous year. However, Xia, due to financial difficulties, was unable to afford the wedding and negotiated to postpone it until around October of last year, but still couldn't complete the marriage. This caused the bride's family to notify relatives twice for the wedding, but both times it fell through, which was a matter of honor. Therefore, they asked the original matchmaker to reason with the groom's family. On December 26th, Xia brought out Fang Lingen to mediate with the bride's family and set a firm date for the wedding on March 24th of this year, promising no further delays. Both parties signed a contract stating that if Xia delayed again beyond the agreed date, the marriage agreement would be canceled, and the 120 yuan gift money would be forfeited by the bride's family. After that, the man and woman could marry separately without interference. Who knew that when March 24th of this year arrived, Xia Xuliang was still struggling financially and unable to hold the wedding. Seeing that the cancellation of the marriage was inevitable, he felt unwilling. A few days ago, he discussed it with Gao Qiaosheng (26 years old, from Jiaxing), a driver employed by the owner of Jiufeng Enamel Factory, and borrowed a car. He attached the factory owner's car license plates, Concession No. 10472 and Municipal Government No. 6582, to the borrowed car. He then invited four or five friends. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, at about 4 PM, Xia led his friends in the car driven by Gao to the bride's home on Beile Road. They rushed inside, dragged the bride Shen Sanlang out, and forced her into the car. They drove straight to Room 33 of the Tiande Hotel at 14 Dalianwan Road, lit red candles, and were about to perform the wedding ceremony when the bride's brother, Shen Axing, saw his sister being kidnapped. He rushed to the French police station to report his sister's abduction and requested an investigation. Detective Zhang Ziying, accompanied by Detective Xin Benchang, went to the Yulin Road police station and, together with Chinese and foreign detectives, rushed to the Tiande Hotel. They apprehended Xia Xuliang and the driver Gao Qiaosheng, and brought them back to the French police station along with the bride Shen Sanlang. First, the bride was released to her brother. Xia and Gao were detained. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special Second Court, where Judge Li Changnian presided over the first criminal court for interrogation. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the police department, stated that the police department's investigation into the defendant's case of unlawful detention was not yet concluded and requested a one-week extension to clarify the matter before filing charges. Subsequently, the detective reported the details of the case. The plaintiffs, Shen Axing and his sister Shen Sanlang, also appeared in court to recount the kidnapping. When questioned, Xia confessed that he was indeed unable to afford the wedding and had been trying to persuade the matchmaker. Gao claimed he was unaware of the forced marriage and that was why he went along. The court ordered a postponement until the morning of the 29th for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>New Zhabei Detective Squad Captures Counterfeit Central Bank Note Criminal</h3>
<p>Li Shuchen, the squad leader of the New Zhabei Detective Squad in Zhabei, received a tip from an informant the day before yesterday (21st) stating that someone was counterfeiting Central Bank corner notes and selling them, and was scheduled to meet with buyers at a certain location on Wuzhen Road that evening. Squad leader Li Shuchen led detectives Liu Bingrong, Yang Yucai, Sun Youzhi, Zang [blank], Zhong Da, Gao Changgui, Liu Tongjie, Lv Fakang, and others to wait at the intersection of Wuzhen Road at around 12 AM the day before yesterday (21st). Soon, a person with a flustered appearance arrived and was immediately apprehended by the detectives. Eighty counterfeit Central Bank corner notes were found on his person. He was immediately taken to the squad.</p>
<p>Confession of Counterfeit Note Criminal Li Guizong</p>
<p>According to the counterfeit note criminal Li Guizong, 39 years old, from Xuzhou, "My cousin Xu Guicheng and I both served in the military and are now discharged. We have nothing to do. I went to Jiaotong Road to find someone and happened to meet Wang Desheng. Because we had worked together before, he asked me how I got to Shanghai. I replied that I was discharged due to illness and had nothing to do and no money to return home. I only had five yuan and that wasn't enough for travel expenses, so I asked Wang Desheng to help me find a way. Wang Desheng told me that he knew Ding Jinzhou and Xiaotian, who knew Wang Xiaomo, and he had two-corner counterfeit notes, five yuan for a pack, which could be used for travel expenses and to return home. He told me to wait for him at the Tiger Stove on Zhongxing Road and told me to give him the five yuan. Wang Desheng immediately gave me the counterfeit notes. Unexpectedly, I was apprehended as soon as I ran to the intersection of Wuzhen Road. Li Xiaode was present and saw Wang Desheng handing me the notes in the teahouse."</p>
<p>The Main Suspect in the Counterfeiting Flees Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>After hearing the confession, the squad leader ordered the original officers to investigate separately. The detectives, accompanied by the criminal, went to the Putuo Road police station and, together with Chinese and foreign detectives, went to the Yuhexing cigarette and paper shop opened by Wang Xiaomo at 316-318 opposite Baiyu Fang on Maba Road, and to the Haiquan Teahouse, but Wang Xiaomo, Wang Desheng, Ding Jinzhou, and Xiaotian had all fled upon hearing the news. They then took the criminal to the thatched shed at No. 45 of the Jiaotong Civilian Workshop and apprehended Li Xiaode.</p>
<p>Confession of Suspect Li Xiaode</p>
<p>According to Li Xiaode's confession, "I know Wang Desheng, Li Guizong, and me. However, although I saw them handing notes in the teahouse, I didn't know the content. He now wants to implicate me. When we were eating tea, Liu Jianqing and Qiu Deshan were also eating tea with us. We didn't know anything about his affairs. Please investigate." After hearing the confession, the squad apprehended Liu Jianqing and Qiu Deshan one after another. Their confessions were the same as Li's. It is heard that the squad reported to the headquarters and ordered the arrest of the fugitives.</p>

<h3>National Children's Painting Exhibition: Works from Guangdong and Shandong Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>As the date of the National Children's Painting Exhibition draws near, the preparatory work is quite tense. In addition to the exhibits from the nineteen units including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Shanxi and Shaanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Weihai, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hebei, Hunan, and Hubei, exhibits from Guangdong and Shandong provinces were also received yesterday, totaling nearly 40,000 pieces. The exhibition venue has decided to arrange all the houses around the sports field, both upstairs and downstairs. On the opening day, in addition to holding a flag-raising ceremony and having the Municipal Public Security Bureau play music, Ms. Ma Fengqi, the wife of Mayor Wu, has been invited to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The exhibition guide is being rushed to compile, and the content includes production statistics, a visitor's guide, etc. Promotional brochures have been distributed to provinces and cities across the country, and a special opening issue has been sent to major newspapers across the country for publication and is currently being compiled. The titles are requested from President Jiang and Minister Wang. A special issue of Modern Parents is also specially compiled and printed.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Zexuan Discusses the Inspection of Compulsory Education in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai Provinces</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously hired Zhuang Zexuan, a professor at Zhejiang University, to inspect compulsory education in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai provinces. After accepting the invitation, Zhuang set off in early April to inspect the provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai for a period of one and a half months. He completed his duties and arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 20th. On the afternoon of the 21st, he went to the Ministry of Education to visit the Vice Minister and report on the inspection. According to Zhuang, education in Qinghai has not been fully developed due to the province's funding of only 100,000 yuan. However, compulsory education has been able to implement the central government's decree according to plan, and more than 100 short-term elementary schools have been promoted. Ordinary education will be implemented in mobile schools according to local nomadic living habits, which can be adapted to local conditions, and progress can be seen in the cause. The promotion of compulsory education in Gansu and Shaanxi has been able to implement the central government's prescribed plans separately. However, the opening of short-term elementary schools is relatively late and has only been gradually promoted in the recent month (May). Each middle school in Gansu has a budget of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and the teaching equipment is also quite impressive. However, there is a greater sense of a lack of teachers, especially in science. However, the Gansu College in the province has planned its content to resemble a higher normal school, paying attention to the cultivation of middle school teachers. In the future, there will be no need to worry about the source of teachers. Ordinary education in Shaanxi has made much progress in recent years. There is also a lack of middle school teachers, especially in the field of science teaching, and the talent is insufficient. The provincial education administration bureau has actively prepared to cultivate teachers to meet the corresponding needs. It is said that Mr. Zhuang will stay in Beijing for a while before returning to Zhejiang University, and then compile a detailed inspection report and submit it to the ministry for review.</p>

<h3>Securities: Although Settlement is Near, the Public Debt Market is as Depressed as Ever</h3>
<p>Yesterday, on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although the settlement was getting closer and closer, the market situation was depressed as before. It is said that the number of deposit accounts is not much. Only the long positions of Nos. 5 and 35 are relatively large. The two words are about seven or eight million combined, and it is difficult to hope that they will receive the goods in full. There will inevitably be some that come out, so there will be pressure before settlement, and the environment will change day by day. The situation in North China, smuggling and troop increases, is becoming more and more serious. It is difficult to hope that this situation will improve. Yesterday, the two morning sessions were weak and lifeless, and the market repeatedly fluctuated. The long side did not raise prices, and the short side did not depress them. However, it seemed that Sichuan was gradually coming out, and the market price hovered between 0.05 yuan and 0.1 yuan. In the two afternoon sessions, the trend was slightly firmer, and retail investors made some repairs. The market situation slightly rebounded to 0.05 yuan to 0.15 yuan, but there was still no improvement. At the close, the long side swapped positions, and trading became increasingly scarce. The trend was still quite stable. It is still difficult to expect a sudden rise in the future, as it is already bound by the environment. The market price result was slightly rebounded by between 0.05 yuan and 0.25 yuan. The total number of transactions was 5.35 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall and the unit of transaction (100 yuan) are listed below:</p>
<p>In addition, the unified restoration of the two public bonds issued this time are all printed by the China Book Company, and the printing fee is estimated to be 359,8029. Because the unified B 10-yuan note cannot be reissued, 1,000 100-yuan notes will be deposited and converted into 10,000 10-yuan notes. Another printing fee of 1,800 yuan was added, so the total cost of the new bond notes was 361,602 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Debt Rebounds Amid Smuggling Rumors</h3>
<p>In the London market, Chinese foreign bonds have risen a lot the day before (21st). The British issued British-German 4.5% continued loan bond rose one pound, to one pound fifty. The British-French 4.5% loan rose fifty points, to 97 pounds fifty. The Cradock and Spore 5% loan (77 pounds) British issued after 5% public debt (88 pounds fifty) China U.S. dollar 5% public debt (94 pounds) Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bonds (47 pounds) and reissued (46 pounds) Hukuang Railway Bonds (52 pounds) Longhai Railway Bonds (32 pounds fifty). The above bonds each rose one pound, but the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bond alone rose one pound fifty, amounting to 74 pounds fifty.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Distance Between Near and Far Dates Narrows; A Lot of Arbitrage Yarn is Delivered</h3>
<p>Although the Longs Are Maintaining the Market, the Result is Still More Than 0.5 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, and the situation became calm again. One party insisted on dragging in and continued to increase its holdings, but the industry tended to sell because yarn sales were not smooth. The competition between the two parties was extremely fierce, and the chips did not decrease. The future fluctuations are still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Runkang and Changfeng are Still Dragging In</p>
<p>The yarn market opened in the morning. Although the longs were prepared to receive goods in the near month, the distance between the near and far months was getting closer and closer. Some arbitrage goods had no profit to arbitrage and had already been delivered. The volume was also huge, and the pressure was still heavy. The market became increasingly soft, and the near month fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. When taking pictures to , Dachangcheng, Changfeng, and Runkang came to drag in and rose by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. However, when shooting in the second session, the decline suddenly rose, and the market was shocked and empty. The price of flour fell sharply, and the auction could not be opened before noon due to the relationship of chasing certificates. People's hearts were impulsive, so the second and third sessions fell sharply by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan. By the time the market closed, the longs came to struggle again, recovering one yuan. As a result, each month fell by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan to 1.1 to 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, a certain party still bought in, and Runkang absorbed a large amount, and the market price moved forward step by step. As a result, each month rebounded by 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tonghe sold 1,000 bags, Dafeng 1,000 bags, Dafu 2,550 bags, Juxing 2,200 bags, Daji 1,050 bags, Qingfeng 1,650 bags, Renfeng 1,050 bags, Yichang 1,250 bags, Xiecheng 1,200 bags, Yongchang 1,000 bags, Yongda 1,000 bags, Taixing 2,100 bags, and Senkang 900 bags.

<p>Inland 145 Guangdong 190 Ningbo 2 Nanjing 5 Nanyang 20 Peers 85 Sichuan 300 Yunnan 50 Xuzhou 5</p>
<h3>The Long's Target Shifts Slightly; Cotton Selling Pressure is Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weaker. Because of the lack of news about receiving goods this month, the long's target is to focus on cotton yarn, and has slightly abandoned cotton. Therefore, the cotton market has been tired recently. At the same time, the current demand of cotton mills has not been very active, but Indian cotton is still there.</p>
<p>Premium Cotton Falls 0.3 Yuan</p>
<p>The premium cotton market opened in the morning, and the current month was weak, falling 0.1 yuan. When shooting at the distant month, the U.S. cotton rose 2 to 6 pounds, and the Indian cotton fell 0.5 to 1 rupee. The situation was slightly firm, rising 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Unexpectedly, when the second session opened, the market mostly said that the price of flour had fallen sharply the previous day. Because the certificates were not complete, the auction was not held before noon. For a time, people's hearts were empty, and the selling pressure was strong. Tong Juxing Feng Runkang Yichang sold off, falling sharply by 0.4 to 0.55 yuan. The second and third sessions recovered 0.1 yuan. As a result, each month fell by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market opened in the afternoon and the yarn market turned better, and the profitable shorts covered their positions and rebounded by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. It was found that Yida sold 1,800 dan, Renfeng 1,800 dan, Jifeng 1,100 dan, Tongji 2,400 dan, Juxing 2,500 dan, Yuda 2,500 dan, Gengfeng 5,100 dan, Yichang 3,100 dan, Runkang 3,600 dan, Dachang 4,400 dan, Jinghua 1,600 dan, Yongchang 1,400 dan, Xincheng 1,400 dan, Yongda 1,200 dan, Hexing bought 2,200 dan, Yuda 3,400 dan, Meiji 3,400 dan, Zhenda 1,100 dan, Shenchang 5,100 dan, Shenji 1,800 dan, Yuan 3,400 dan, Changfeng 2,000 dan, Xinchang 1,900 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,500 dan, Changhe 4,200 dan. The daily highest and lowest prices and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton consumption is mediocre, and factory demand is all sporadic transactions. The source is Yao flower 190 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou flower 51.25, Shenxin Factory imported 800 bales, Spot goods sent to factory Baohua 57.00, Dakang Factory imported 65 pieces Again Again</p>
<h3>Favorable Weather, U.S. Cotton Closes Firmly</h3>
<p>The U.S. and Japan markets were hesitant. The May cotton was thrown out, but the market price did not move. Although there was short selling and Far East goods sold in the remaining months, they were absorbed by peers and Liverpool gangs. Therefore, it rose by 1 to pounds. Trading in the market was entirely dominated by peers, and there were very few new buyers and sellers. The Atlantic provinces and the south of Texas have received rain, and the weather is generally favorable. The closing was firm, with spot prices unchanged and futures prices rising from unchanged to seven pounds. British cotton spot prices fell 5 points, and futures were balanced. Japanese cotton was initially tired due to the long's settlement, but rebounded due to reactive buying. The total change in Pingle was 0.5 to 0.75 rupee, Omra fell 0.25 to 0.5 rupee, and Bailuo Creek fell 0.25 to 0.5 rupee. Original telegram (21st telegram)</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuo Creek flower in July and August on the 22nd was 200 rupees, an increase of 0.25 rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Three Items (Yarn and Cotton) All Reported Declines</h3>

<h3>Piece Goods White Hailin Woolen Cloth Market Price Very Hot</h3>
<p>White herringbone Hailin woolen cloth has been selling briskly lately. There is great demand from Western clothing tailors, and new arrivals are very scarce, resulting in a lively market and rising prices. For making Western-style trousers, about six or seven out of ten customers now choose this material, making it quite popular. The standard market price on the main road has already jumped by twenty or thirty cents or so compared to last week. Last week, white Hailin woolen cloth was wholesaled at four dollars and seventy-eight cents per yard, but now it is actually selling for five dollars and twelve cents, and even then, the stock is not very large. According to recent calculations based on the Gold Standard exchange rate, the cost price still exceeds the selling price in Shanghai. Therefore, industry insiders believe the market may see another sharp rise.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales Still Difficult and Slow; Fine Yarn Factory Cloth Still Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth piece goods sales were difficult to achieve due to weak yarn prices and the impact of smuggled goods in South China. Factories are suffering from large inventories that are difficult to sell. Local dyed cotton cloth from trading houses lacks a good outlook as the end of the month approaches and they intend to settle accounts with the market within the month, causing the market to weaken slightly. However, fine cloths, like the Blue Sun and Double Dragon Pearl Horse brands, are performing well because they are scarce, factory prices are firm, and selling prices are uniquely good. Among the white goods from this factory, only fine cloth and coarse cloth sales are still acceptable. Zhejiang's Jiaxing and Huzhou continue to purchase more than fifty bales of light-weight coarse cloth, which is needed for making silkworm cocoon bags. Heavy-weight coarse cloth, after a batch purchased from the northern route and military uniform tailors, is now in short supply, and the selling market is strong. Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi white fine cloth purchases continue to rise. Yesterday, another one hundred and several tens of pieces were traded. Plain Soochow silk fabric sales remain strong, while colored goods are most affected by smuggled goods, making recovery difficult. Goods from domestic and foreign factories like China, Wa Fung, and Heng Fung have been falling previously, and yesterday the goods from Lun Chang factory also followed the downward trend, with some pieces falling by as much as five dimes.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Smuggled Woven Goods Being Dumped Extensively; Several Major Silk Factories Have Announced Shutdown; Shanghai Guild Petitions for Intensified Anti-Smuggling</h3>
<p>No. 120 "Sky Bridge" brand has no smuggled goods, and inventory has dried up. The market is looking hot, and prices continue to soar. More than twenty cases were traded yesterday at prices ranging from three hundred forty-six to seventy dollars, up more than ten dollars yesterday. Cargo owners are still not eager to sell. Local silk factories are also purchasing European No. 120 "Snow Dragon" No. 4 Shiny silk, four cases at two hundred and several tens of dollars, and several cases of No. 120 "Chiu Li" factory "Sun" brand, at three hundred... Factory names are starting to be written in, one hundred cases of "Western Stone" No. 4 Shiny Silk at one hundred dollars each, excluding tax. Currently, a very large quantity of smuggled woven goods is being transported from North China and dumped extensively, placing the Shanghai silk industry on the brink of ruin. Several major silk thread and damask factories are currently shut down. Yesterday, the Shanghai Guild resolved to petition the authorities for intensified anti-smuggling efforts. Also, yesterday afternoon after three o'clock, at the Shanghai Jianghai Customs tender for No. 120 No. 1 "Sky Bridge" brand, the price rose to three hundred seventy dollars, and five pieces were traded, sold by Ding Feng He Ji.</p>
<h3>Keemun Tea Arrives Exceeding 10,000 Cases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than two thousand cases of Keemun black tea imported from Hangzhou arrived, bringing the total to more than ten thousand three hundred cases. It is rumored that a large shipment will arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Green Tea Market Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhuyazhuang green tea market condition resumed its desolate trend. English and French trading houses have no interest in purchasing precious eyebrow and shrimp eye green teas. Only needle eyebrow tea had some sporadic sales. The reason is that the various foreign firms have already shipped out the tea purchased in recent days and are not currently in urgent need. Also, companies such as Xie He, Yi He, and Jin Jiang have received telegrams from abroad expressing concerns about the high prices for Tunxi precious eyebrow tea, so they are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, Wenzhou black tea sales continue to be active. Pingshui pearl tea arrived two days ago. Although it was peddled around, no foreign firms were discussing prices. Only Hua Chang made a counteroffer, but because the price was too low, it was not accepted. Finally, yesterday afternoon, the price was raised to fifty-eight and fifty-six dollars to open the market, similar to last year's opening price. About two hundred and several tens of pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>Grains: Futures Rose Again After the Fall; Trading Halted for Half a Day in the Morning Due to Margin Calls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was suspended for half a day due to margin calls in the morning. In the afternoon, trading resumed as usual. As for the market situation, the quoted prices for foreign wheat, Chicago wheat was slightly up by eight points and Canadian wheat by about two to three cents. However, most people felt that the market might soften because of the heavy rain in the morning followed by a return to sunny weather in the afternoon. Therefore, at the opening, the prices for all months fell by two to three cents or so compared to the previous day. For example, the price for June was a minimum of 89.25 cents, which was the recent minimum record. However, the market changed dramatically, and prices soon rebounded as large speculators took profits and covered their short positions, and those who sold long positions were also eager. As the factories did not participate, the market sentiment stabilized slightly. Trading in all contracts remained active, with over one million bags traded in half a day. According to general market speculation, if the weather is favorable and the wheat harvest is abundant, the market outlook will remain weak.</p>
<p>Closing Prices on the 21st Closing Prices on the 22nd Comparison</p>
<p>June 2.9175 2.935 Rose 0.0175</p>
<p>July 2.78 2.7825 Rose 0.0025</p>
<p>August 2.7825 2.7875 Rose 0.0050</p>
<p>September 2.8025 2.8075 Rose 0.0050</p>
<p>October 2.8225 2.8275 Rose 0.0050</p>
<h3>Unpredictable Weather Causes Wheat Prices to Rise and Fall - The Overseas Wheat Production Situation -</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market opened in the morning with prices showing an initial rise followed by a fall. Due to the heavy rain in the morning, market sentiment unanimously turned bullish, and the asking prices for all months were three to four points higher than the previous day. Later, as the sun came out and the weather improved, sellers regained the upper hand, and as selling orders increased, the prices for all months fell by two to three cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, prices initially softened due to the lower opening prices in the flour market, and the prices for all months fell sharply by three to five or six cents. By the second trading session, prices rebounded by three to five cents as the flour market rebounded and short covering was heavy. Currently, new trading is gradually developing, but the market fluctuations are also chaotic. As new wheat has not yet entered the market, both long and short positions are purely speculative, and there is no actual basis for prediction. Currently, alum is still not available due to lack of arrivals, and factory demand has not moved. There have also been no deliveries seen.</p>
<p>According to a report by New Fun Foreign Firm on foreign wheat, the US government's May 11th report estimates winter wheat production at 463,708,000 bushels, compared to the April 11th estimate of 493,000,000 bushels. Last year's US winter wheat harvest was 433,447,000 bushels, so this year's increase is only 30 million bushels. On the other hand, European reports indicate that their production is decreasing. It is rumored that spring wheat planting in Soviet Russia is delayed, and this year's sown area is only 55 million acres, compared to 103 million acres last year. The wheat crop in Italy seems to be very poor, with a 30% reduction in yield compared to last year, and it will likely import from France to make up the shortfall. British inventories are lower than before. According to a speech by the Minister of Defense in the April 15th issue of "Grain Industry News," British flour and wheat inventories, including local supply, are only sufficient for three months. Australian exports are larger than last year. Currently, visible supply is considerably less than at this time last year. Regarding new wheat, the weather is arid, and rain is urgently needed. Weather conditions in Argentina are favorable, and cultivation is proceeding as usual. As of March this year, Canadian wheat inventories totaled 246,022,000 bushels, compared to 283,000,000 bushels last year. Last year's harvest totaled 277,340,000 bushels, plus a carryover of 215,000,000 bushels, for a total supply of 492,340,000 bushels. From this, it can be seen that Canada has already cleared 246,000,000 bushels. The condition of US spring wheat is currently unknown, but it is known that planting is very late. If the weather is unfavorable during the growing season, serious events will occur. Last year's US winter wheat harvest totaled 170,000,000 bushels. If this year's spring wheat harvest is poor, market sentiment will likely be bullish. The government's first spring wheat condition report is expected to be released around June 10th. The most important factor related to wheat crops is the moisture in the soil. The moisture accumulated from July to December last year is particularly important to the new wheat crop. Notably, the rainfall in the winter wheat region during that period was only 64% of normal. The future trend of the market will be determined by the weather and Canadian wheat exports. Importing countries this season may still rely on Canadian wheat for their survival, so wheat prices seem likely to rise gradually.</p>
<p>US wheat prices are fluctuating based on the changing supply and demand in May, and there are also suspicious reports of dust storms. The future may be bearish.</p>
<h3>White Keng Rice Market Steady, Thin Indica Rice Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various sources totaled only ten-odd, with a total of over three thousand piculs. Sales on this street were average, but market sentiment was better. The northern gang continued to purchase over one thousand bags of Baozi, so the market seemed to be slightly tighter. Although early Keng rice prices have not changed much, thin Indica rice prices, excluding stable high-quality rice, have improved by nearly ten cents for middle-grade rice due to its scarcity. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian rice prices remain similar.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various routes along the river totaled seventeen or eighteen. Sales of various types of rice in the market were unremarkable. White Keng rice remained sluggish, with prices fluctuating between three and five cents. Sporadic thin Indica rice transactions were stagnant, with prices remaining stable and Yuan rice prices showing a weak trend. Yang rice was stable, while Du Jian and Ke Jian rice were slightly weaker by three to four cents. Prices for other goods remained peaceful.</p>
<h3>Medium Grade Indica Rice Sells Well at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new medium and low-grade Indica rice continued to arrive at the port from various routes for sale. Because the medium and low-grade rice stored on various routes was heating up due to the hot weather, sellers were eager to sell. Local rice merchants were also willing to settle accounts at lower prices, so the market seemed to need a gradual adjustment. Yesterday, the market for medium and low-grade Indica rice continued to weaken, but as prices fell slightly, local demand increased. Yesterday, the inland gang also brought nearly a thousand bags of medium and low-grade heating Gan late rice to the market for sale. Other rice merchants remained on the sidelines. This street also sold medium and low-grade rice quickly due to the low prices, and sales were brisk. The market became active due to price cuts, with a total of 4,600 bags of Gan rice, 600 bags of Zhejiang rice, and 190 bags of Zha rice sold throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Falls Again by 40 Cents; New Rapeseed Follows the Decline</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market situation continued to weaken, and sales still showed no improvement. Although 850 pieces were traded yesterday, prices fell again by forty cents, and the overall trend remained downward. Under these weak oil prices, new rapeseed also followed the decline, opening at 8.05 to 8 dollars, with 3,000 bags traded. The future trend still depends on the fluctuating oil prices.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Sugar Tender Sales Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Guild's trading session called for the same prices as before for No. 24 coarse granulated white and Dong Chi Bai sugar, but there were some transactions in Dong Bai sugar. Spot prices for No. 9, JRO mark, were 21.10 dollars. Transshipment goods for No. 4 (J) mark were 7.075 dollars, JP mark was 7.05 dollars, slightly lower than the previous day. No. 8 YT mark was 6.45 dollars, with little other activity. The factory's refined white sugar still called for the original price, with few transactions. For trademarked goods, only the Jian gang offered over a hundred bags of various white sugars, with higher prices at 17 dollars and lower prices at 16 dollars. There were no continued offers for Qing Chi sugar. Yesterday was also the tender day for the United Company, with a total fixed amount of 5,427 bags of Guangdong coarse white sugar, etc. Tender prices did not rise or fall, and transactions increased slightly compared to Wednesday. 780 bags of coarse white sugar from Wu Yang City Xin Factory were sold at 21.80 dollars, 10 bags from Qu Xi Factory were sold at 21.60 dollars, 460 bags of No. 2 refined white sugar were sold at 20.80 dollars, and 5,000 bags of No. 4 were sold at 20.60 dollars. Medium-grade granulated white sugar from the City Xin Factory was not sold at 19.80 dollars.</p>
<h3>Metals: Dong Bai Iron Competes for Sales and Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Zhongshan Factory in this city last year, Dong Bai iron imports from Osaka have disappeared. However, since the establishment of the Asia Factory recently (reorganized from the former Daming Factory), the factory has been lowering its selling prices repeatedly to attract customers in order to compete for business. The market has deteriorated, with prices for sizes like 3 feet by 7 feet selling for 1.034 dollars per sheet, 3 feet by 6 feet selling for 80 cents, No. 24 selling for 2.034 dollars per sheet, No. 26 selling for 1.6034 dollars, and No. 28 selling for around 1.40 dollars. Transactions were higher because the Zhongshan Factory shipped a lot of goods, and general buyers were also happy to purchase products from the Asia Factory. The two factories ship about 15,000 sheets per day. However, transactions in this city are limited, and business in other cities is scarce due to the depressed market, resulting in a situation of oversupply throughout the city.</p>

<h3>The Capabilities of Japanese Women</h3>
<p>— Li Zongwen</p>
<p>— One of my Impressions While Touring Japan</p>
<p>Having grown accustomed to the passive attitudes of both old and new women in China, upon arriving in Japan, I was particularly struck by the important role Japanese women play in society.</p>
<p>A female American member of our traveling group was asked for her impressions of Japanese women. She wittily remarked:</p>
<p>"The hands of Japanese women are noticeably coarser than those of Chinese women."</p>
<p>I found this comment to be extremely insightful. This is because coarse hands are not exclusive to impoverished Japanese women; women of the middle class, and even the pampered daughters of the elite, possess these strong, clumsy hands. Delicate hands, like those of pure white jade, hands that are exquisitely sculpted and beautiful but incapable of action, are rarely seen in Japan.</p>
<p>It is because they possess these strong, clumsy hands that one finds Japanese women working in all kinds of shops, big and small, new and old. In hotels, theaters, cars, and trams, Japanese women are carrying out their duties. One hears the crisp, clear voices of Japanese women saying, "Please come in," "Please buy something," and "Thank you for your patronage." One sees the diligent service of Japanese women, those who use their minds and those who use their labor, doing all kinds of work. Their attire is very elegant, their demeanor is extremely dignified, and their temperaments are especially gentle. Society's perception of them is also very fair, without any undercurrent of vulgar or distorted notions. They themselves believe that serving society is their natural duty, and that labor is their proper share, and not something lowly. They feel ashamed of women who only consume and do not work!</p>
<p>In Kyoto, I saw the niece of the mayor of Kyoto working as a waitress in the restaurant of the Daimaru department store. She served customers politely and docilely, without the slightest trace of arrogance.</p>
<p>After traveling through the eight major cities of Japan and seeing similar phenomena everywhere, I came to the following conclusions:</p>
<p>"The position of Japanese women in the workforce is deeply entrenched; in other words, Japanese businesses cannot do without women."</p>
<p>"If the Japanese business world were to undergo a sudden change, with men immediately withdrawing to deal with the upheaval, women would be capable of instantly replacing the men, maintaining and developing existing businesses."</p>
<p>"Young women serve in the workforce, older women manage the household, and young girls attend school. As a result, men can enlist in the army, emigrate abroad, develop foreign trade, and expand the territory of the 'empire,' making it easier for the nation to progress."</p>
<p>"Women are indeed the driving force that allows men to develop abroad without worrying about matters at home!"</p>
<p>When I was in China, I heard people say that there were three treasures in the world: Western houses, Chinese cuisine, and Japanese women. According to their meaning, starting from the selfishness of men, it is simply because Japanese women are so gentle and obedient, offering greetings in the morning and inquiries in the evening, kneeling when one leaves and prostrating in welcome when one returns, making the husband feel like a great emperor, invincible, so they say that Japanese women are truly earthly treasures. This is meaningless. According to my meaning, the reason why Japanese women can be regarded as precious should be attributed to their capabilities, to their pair of great and clumsy hands!</p>
<p>If any of you female readers do not believe the author's words, please lift up your slender jade hands, and then think:</p>
<p>"If China were to undergo a sudden change and men had to withdraw from the business world, would you be able to stand up immediately and help the men maintain and develop existing businesses?"</p>
<p>This is not a trivial matter!</p>
<p>This year is, as it were, a so-called "extraordinary period," and I hope that everyone will carefully consider my words!</p>
<p>"What great, clumsy hands!" I could not help but exclaim again and again!</p>
<h3>Women of Yantai</h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>Yantai, also known as Zhifu, is located on the northern coast of the Shandong Peninsula and is the gateway to northern China. Because it is located in a remote area with inconvenient transportation, the social situation in Yantai is still very closed off. However, since the May Fourth Movement, many women from Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places have come to Yantai, so from the outside, the differences between old and new women in Yantai are indeed terrifying! Women with short hair, wearing cheongsams and long vests, and high-heeled leather shoes are Yantai women; women wearing headscarves, leggings, and three-inch embroidered shoes are also Yantai women; and their thoughts are also very different. Now, I will roughly write about the situation of Yantai women as I know it.</p>
<p>In a modern male-centered society, the status of women is naturally very low. Yantai society is also male-centered, so their status cannot transcend the male authority of thousands of years. The habit of valuing men over women is still deeply rooted in the minds of Yantai people. Their families not only distinguish between men and women, but also have very strict distinctions between seniors and juniors. As a daughter-in-law in the family, she is both the slave of her husband and the ox and horse of her parents-in-law. They serve their husbands and parents-in-law in the morning and evening, and if they are not satisfied, they will be cursed and scolded; they follow their husband and parents-in-law's commands all day long, and if they are not considerate, they will be rebuked, and these are all very ordinary things. In addition, the most terrible treatment is no more than child brides. Yantai people rarely have the bad habit of keeping concubines, which is indeed their advantage; but child brides also serve two people. Their lives in these inhuman families is imaginable! Everyone recognizes that women are appendages of men. Except for the bourgeoisie, where husbands are honored and children are valued, or highly capable noblewomen who can get social compliments, most women have no status in society. The old forces in society still dominate everything, and the authority of the old ethics is still inviolable.</p>
<p>Speaking of their occupations, they are really too young. Bourgeois women, of course, have their husband's wealth, live very wealthy lives, and have very comfortable environments. Occupation is unnecessary for them. Living a very happy life in the family is their lifelong occupation! Middle-class women are about the same, but not as comfortable as the wealthy. Cooking, sweeping, raising children, and all household chores are mostly done by themselves. There are even those engaged in school education, but they are rare, very few. As for proletarian women, they are the creators of social value. They go to hairnet factories to work during the day and go to literacy schools to study at night. In addition to cooking, sweeping, and raising children, they must also support themselves. They go to the factory to work every day, not only to maintain their own lives, but sometimes also to raise their children, and even to support their husbands! However, because they lack knowledge, they only know how to obey the factory owner, and do not know how to improve their treatment, and are subjected to the ravages of capitalists! Therefore, their work is very hard and their wages are very low. I hope that those engaged in the women's movement will rise up to improve their status and increase their welfare.</p>
<h3>Women in the Current Stage of Russia</h3>
<p>— Chen Kuiying</p>
<p>Russian women have a particularly ardent sense of national identity compared to women in other countries. Thus, they persevere valiantly in the "trials" of the careers they have chosen. As a result, the scope of their achievements is as vast as that of men, far surpassing the women of Europe and America.</p>
<p>With regard to Soviet professional circles, since all gender distinctions have been abolished, women can become tailors of Western clothing or foundry workers or even members of the army and navy if they so desire. Currently, the number of male and female workers in all factories is roughly equal. In terms of duties, they exhibit superior efficiency in precise and scientific tasks compared to men.</p>
<p>There are now 50,000 aviators and aviation officers and more than 2.5 million members of the Chemical Defense League across Russia. Among them, the most prominent is the "Youth League" organized by young, brave women in the Moscow Women's Air Force, founded by Army Minister Voroshilov. They have cut their hair short and dress like male soldiers. The Minister of the Army was very proud of their agility and courage, saying, "Their parachute training is even better than their bombing techniques."</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are technicians, entrepreneurs, and other positions that are almost entirely occupied by men in other countries, but in Russia, women occupy even the important seat of president, and their activities are no less vigorous than those of men.</p>
<p>Based on the facts above, Russian women harbor hope for the future, and they are willing to endure and struggle through any kind of life, no matter how arduous.</p>

<h3>Women's Trends Around the World (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Iranian Girls Studying in Europe</p>
<p>Iran (formerly Persia), although an ancient country, has a very backward culture, especially women's education, which has always been ignored. In the past, although there were occasionally a few aristocratic women who went to Europe to study, they were limited to England, and very few of them studied in specialized schools or above. Usually, after completing the middle school curriculum in England. They can already return to China and be called highly educated. But in the past three or four years, the situation has changed drastically. Not only have the number of women studying in Europe broken historical records, but also the average annual number of students studying in Europe has increased four to five times compared with three or four years ago. The place of study is not limited to England. France, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, etc. There are all. Among them, two are studying music in France and are very popular. One of them studying law in Belgium is said to be very promising. Most of these women come from middle-class families. Most of them receive government funding for studying abroad. It can be seen that women in this ancient country are gradually moving towards the path of liberation.</p>
<h3>The Perspective of Potential Spouses After Women Have Inheritance Rights</h3>
<p>German Women's Labor Camps</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power in Germany, one hears the slogan "Women Return to the Home" everywhere, and the women's movement in Germany seems to have suffered a fatal blow. But that is not the case. Those returning to the home are mostly women over the age of thirty and married women. Women under the age of thirty and between the ages of sixteen who are seeking marriage are trained in batches to perform labor service. Currently, the training method is tentatively set for three phases, each lasting six months. During the training period, they must temporarily leave their families or schools and live in labor camps, living almost entirely like soldiers. However, in addition to receiving wartime service training every day, they must also perform duties according to their inclinations. Such as road construction, river dredging, transportation, electricity, as well as assisting nearby farm women, handling household chores, raising infants, managing livestock, farms, and so on. In the first and second phases, there is no remuneration. In the third phase, they can receive a stipend of sixty pfennigs per week. If the training is completed, the results are excellent, and they are willing to continue serving, they can receive one mark and eighty pfennigs per week. Therefore, German women may, in the future, be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with Soviet women.</p>
<h3>Women's Life in Menghe</h3>
<p>— Shen Liang</p>
<p>Menghe, located in the middle of Changzhou and Danyang counties, has a small castle with a circumference of three miles, but it has already decayed into an earthen mound. It is a remote and poor area in the south of the Yangtze River. Most of the men make a living in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Huzhou, so the women of Menghe must take on all the household affairs and field work. Compared to the women in the interior of Zhejiang, who do not work in the fields, they have a much harder life.</p>
<p>In the spring, when the wheat fields are in the seedling stage, there is no work, so they knot hemp at home, preparing summer clothes and mosquito net material, but most of them are sold or pawned. Some spin cotton, spinning several handfuls of cotton slivers a day. Families without cotton hire neighbors to spin and earn some wages. Until the Qingming Festival, they start cultivating the wheat fields, weeding and loosening the soil. Then they sow soybean seeds.</p>
<p>By early summer, their work is already tight. They instruct their children to grind sickles and go to the fields to cut wheat. The cut wheat is left in the fields, and they are afraid of it getting wet and sprouting from the rain, so they must carry it home to the threshing ground in front of their doors overnight. Every woman in Menghe can carry loads, with a weight of one to two hundred catties on their shoulders, walking very quickly. They are also good at pushing wheelbarrows. After the wheat is threshed, they load the wheat stalks onto the carts and push them to the market towns to sell. They don't know how to use the abacus or read, but they never calculate the accounts incorrectly. They then buy bean cakes and push them back to feed the pigs and fertilize the rice paddies.</p>
<p>When the wheat has not been completely harvested, they have to prepare the rice paddies. Soaking rice seeds and drawing water. They are good at drawing water, working all day and night like men. Children and young girls also take turns helping to draw water. When there is not enough time, they hire busy workers, so they have to boil tea and cook meals to serve them. Those with babies have to take care of the babies. At the same time, the soybean fields need to be weeded, the pigs need to eat, the sheep need to eat... The women of Menghe don't even have time to wash their faces during the busy season. Their hair is like crow's nests, tied with a piece of blue cloth, and their trouser legs are rolled up very high (this cannot be compared to the bare legs of urban ladies), stepping in the mud all day long.</p>
<p>After transplanting the rice seedlings, they draw water when it is dry, and when there is too much rain, they have to drain it out. When the soybeans are old, they have to go to the fields to pull the beans under the scorching sun, unafraid of the stinging caterpillars on the soybean leaves. Pulling and whipping are all done by their hands. Only after harvesting the rice and planting the wheat again can they get a little rest. But can they really rest? Making shoes for their husbands who are away from home, sewing and mending winter clothes for their children, rent collectors come, and grain collectors come again. Their husbands don't bring money home, and they rely entirely on them to deal with it. In recent years, Menghe has also suffered from famine, and even though the women of Menghe have iron skin and bones, they cannot cope with it.</p>
<h3>To My Sister Fen, Who Stayed in Nara, Japan</h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>Sister Fen:</p>
<p>Seven years without returning to the motherland. When boarding the ship in Kobe, although there was some reluctance to say goodbye to Qi, Zhongying, and you, the thought of seeing the mountains and rivers of the motherland again and tasting the food of the motherland again made me feel infinitely happy, so much so that when you stood on the pier with red eyes, waving your white handkerchiefs, I couldn't shed a single tear for you.</p>
<p>On the ship, I was constantly thinking about everything in the motherland, wishing I could gather all the compatriots on the ship and ask them to give me some reports, whether they made me happy or unhappy, as long as they told me something. But I was very disappointed. After only asking two people, I didn't have the courage to ask further. Although they only said three or four sentences, the deep gray color expressed in their words was enough to arouse my anxiety and sadness.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, I stayed at my elder sister's house for three days (today is the fourth day). What I saw and heard was enough to turn a person with hot blood into a person with cold blood, and a person with energy into a person without energy. Just talking about women, in terms of spirit and form, there is no place that is not completely opposite to Japanese women. I don't understand why everyone knows to buy cheap Japanese goods, but no one bothers to learn the beautiful nature of the Japanese!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my elder sister took us to Zhaofeng Park, which is managed by the local concession authorities. This trip was simply filled with mixed feelings. I can ignore everything else and just talk about two ladies: one was a young lady dressed in complete modern fashion, with a husband wearing a suit, and a child also dressed in a suit. As she walked along, she used fluent English to direct her child. Whether the child understood or not, I don't know, but the people next to her were indeed very envious of her, and she herself was indeed extremely proud. I think such good "family national subjugation education" would be hard to find not only in Japan but also in other countries.</p>
<p>There was also a very modern young lady with a child, a child who was terribly dirty and very weak, so he walked very slowly. But his mother didn't care about him, dragged his little hand and walked as hard as she could. The child cried, but she still didn't listen, and continued to talk to her companions with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say about this phenomenon, but I hope the situation in the inland is not like this!</p>
<p>I'm very sorry that I sent you such a bucket of ice water in my first letter! Goodbye! I wish you progress! Your sister, Xue</p>
<p>Special Report of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Ms. Xiong Zhi Talks About Child Welfare After Returning from Europe and America</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Child welfare is highly valued in European and American countries, and it is considered one of the most important undertakings in social education. No matter which country it is, it is inevitable to suffer from poverty, hardship, and disaster. Among the poor classes, there are inevitably orphaned children. The most tragic people in the world are these children. Think about it: if parents are so poor that they don't have enough clothes, where can poor children find a life? If both parents are dead, where can orphans find a way to survive? When it comes to receiving education and vocational training, it is of course impossible to talk about it in their entire lives. Their only chance of survival depends entirely on whether the government has child welfare facilities and whether society can provide assistance. This has been handled very well in civilized countries. In our country, almost no one has understood the meaning of the two words "child welfare". At best, child welfare work can only be said to be in its infancy. Recently, Ms. Xiong Zhi, the daughter of Mr. Xiong Xiling, investigated children's education and child welfare in Europe and America. On the third day after returning to China, she talked to me about her impressions of her trip to Europe and America.</p>
<p>Ms. Xiong studied education when she was studying in the United States. She also obtained a master's degree from the Teachers College of Columbia University and Bana University. After returning to China in 1927, she followed her mother, Madam Xiong Zhuqi, at the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute, which was founded by her father in Beiping, to handle child welfare education. It has been nine years. She feels very interested, so she devotes all her energy to the thousands of suffering children in the Children's Welfare Institute. She said, "I had never been to Europe before. This time, I took a long vacation and made a pilgrimage to various European countries. I was very interested. I set sail last September and spent eight months traveling through Italy, Russia, Germany, England, and France, and returned via the United States. I investigated the organization of nurseries, kindergartens, and kindergartens in various countries, the methods of training and educating personnel, and, on behalf of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, paid attention to child welfare in various countries."</p>
<p>I asked her which country was the most developed in handling child welfare. She said, "When it comes to children enjoying the happiness of scientific education, the Soviet Union is the most common. Because their social system is different, all large industries are state-owned, so work-study education is very well run. Each industrial area has nurseries, kindergartens, kindergartens, and primary schools nearby. The children of workers receive scientific education from an early age. There are also clubs where children can play games, practice martial arts, have fun, and learn various crafts at will. Even in rural collectives, there are child carts coming and going, without leaving the mother's feeding. With such a good environment, are children still afraid of wandering and dropping out of school? The spirit of research on methods of educating children is best in the United States and Britain, and not bad in Germany and Italy. In all countries, this is handled by the private sector, or subsidized by the government, given guidance and supervision, so naturally it will not be done badly."</p>
<p>Talking, talking, we talked about women again. I asked her about her impression of women in various countries. She told me that although Hitler had shouted the slogan "Women return to the family", German women still serve society as usual, not all turning backwards. The occupations of European and American women are different from those in our country. In our country, serving society and managing household affairs are divided into two things. This extreme view is wrong. They do social work and take care of household affairs at the same time, and the two go hand in hand. For example, they work outside during the day, and when they come back from the office, they still do household chores. Unlike women in our country, who think that if they work outside, they don't care about household chores. Some don't cook at meals and don't do anything at home. What's the point of this? Men and women in Russia do the same labor. Women work during the day and leave their children in nurseries, and still hold them home for education at night. The same is true for women in Germany, Italy, Britain, and the United States. They think that men should have jobs, and women should also have jobs. Economic independence is not divided between men and women. If a woman has no job and is not economically independent, it is a shame, it is no good. This concept is completely different from ours.</p>
<p>In your opinion, what aspects of European and American women are worth emulating by women in our country? After I said that, Ms. Xiong laughed heartily. She said, "This question is not easy to answer. There are many virtuous women in China, so how can they be completely erased!" I said that this example doesn't matter. Our attitude is to learn from others' strengths and make up for our weaknesses. If others have strengths, it is our lesson. So she said the following:</p>
<p>European and American women are very strong and have regular lives. They pay more attention to hygiene than we do.</p>
<p>They teach and raise their children very seriously. People who are new mothers often refer to many books and study scientific methods to teach their children, and do not easily leave them to others.</p>
<p>When managing their homes, they can use scientific methods, do not use servants, operate themselves, and are organized.</p>
<p>The spirit of service to society is admirable. Many women volunteer for child welfare and public welfare undertakings, working all day without remuneration, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>They are eager to learn. Women who have graduated from school still read books and newspapers and strive to make progress.</p>
<p>Finally, she came to a conclusion: Most women are still parasites! They are not economically independent, they don't make progress in their studies, and their service is not genuine. Liberation! Liberation! It's just a cliché. If you want equality between men and women, how can you succeed completely?</p>

<h3>Edema</h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>This disease is caused by the excessive infiltration and stagnation of filtrate in tissues or body cavities. The causes are divided into systemic and local. The name of the symptom varies depending on the location. Such as pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion, coelomic edema, edema (skin), hydrocephalus, hydromyelia, joint effusion, etc.</p>
<p>The causes of edema are classified as congestive edema, cachectic edema, nervous edema, infectious toxic edema, renal edema, and compensatory edema.</p>
<p>An Example of Edema Treatment</p>
<p>Diuretin T.o</p>
<p>Puln. fol. Digital 0.05</p>
<p>Morphin Muriat 0.003</p>
<p>(Dosage) Divided into ten packets. Take one packet after each meal. This publication can prepare it for one yuan. Regularly taking "Orchitin" for this disease can promote early treatment.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>This disease is mostly caused by masturbation, phimosis, sexual weakness, and unsafe smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Treatment for this disease: strictly abstain from masturbation, remove the foreskin, take "Testisan" internally to treat sexual weakness and neurasthenia, and safely quit smoking. "Hemitol's Spermatorrhea Pills" are most effective for symptomatic medication. Concurrent electrotherapy is very fast.</p>
<p>(Note) Foreskin removal and electrotherapy should be performed by an expert to avoid any pain. Dr. Zhan Nianceng is knowledgeable and skilled in surgery. If you state that you were introduced by this publication, you can receive preferential treatment. This is a recommendation.</p>
<h3>Bone Pain and Uremia</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Internal rheumatism and uncleared residual toxins can hinder excretion, causing uremia to remain in the blood, leading to symptoms such as bone and joint pain. This uremia is called uric acid. Its crystals are like broken glass fragments, located between the bones and joints, causing bone and joint pain. If it enters the tendons, it causes spasms. If it enters the muscles, it causes soreness. If it enters the limbs, it causes numbness. If it is delayed and untreated, it can not only cause hemiplegia but also arteriosclerosis, with the risk of stroke and sudden collapse.</p>
<p>Treatment for this disease: taking the famous medicine "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills" is very effective because its medicinal properties take into account the various causes mentioned above. This spring, I repeatedly used it to cure Mr. Tang Qinzhai's numbness in his hands and feet, Mr. Bao Jianfeng's gonorrheal arthritis, and Mr. Shi Yaquan's long-term rheumatic bone pain. The duration was no more than one month.</p>
<h3>Neurasthenia Has Many Complications</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The nervous system is one of the three major systems in the human body. It is responsible for sensation, and activity depends on it. Each part has glands to nourish it. If the glands weaken, the nerves lose their prosperity and become weak, causing various diseases.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia has the most symptoms. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into cerebral neurasthenia (such as dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, and forgetfulness), sexual neurasthenia (such as nocturnal emission, seminal emission, premature ejaculation, and kidney failure), spinal neurasthenia (such as back pain), and systemic neurasthenia (such as fatigue, weakness, incomplete development, and premature aging). Palpitations, fear, leanness, night sweats, and infertility after a long marriage are all the most common symptoms of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>The treatment for neurasthenia lies in seeking to restore its prosperity. Nerve prosperity lies in strengthening its glands and glandular organs. The reproductive glands are the most important glandular organs in the human body. Not only are they related to offspring, but they also nourish sperm, nourish the brain, nourish the blood, nourish the spirit, increase resistance, promote development, strengthen the body, rejuvenate, and prolong life. All are directly related to it.</p>
<p>"Testisan" is a famous medicine made from reproductive glands. It has a special effect on treating various symptoms of neurasthenia. Women should take "Female Testisan", which has the word "Female" on it. It has the functions of regulating menstruation, treating leucorrhea, calming the fetus, and protecting production.</p>
<h3>Another Example of Stomach Pain and Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The pain of stomach pain is unspeakable. Mild cases cause acid reflux and vomiting. Severe cases cause inflammation, swelling, and spasms. When the pain occurs, one groans and wants to die. Ordinary medicines relieve pain temporarily. Once the medicinal properties are gone, the pain reappears. All diseases cause pain, and pain has a root cause. If the root cause is not treated, how can one achieve lasting relief? It is only a temporary cover-up.</p>
<p>The causes of stomach pain are diverse. This publication has discussed them in detail before. The general habit is to smoke to relieve it. The nicotine paralyzes temporarily, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst. The stomach disease is not cured, and smoking addiction is formed. Twofold shackles are enough for one person to endure.</p>
<p>In early spring, Mr. Hu Yanjun introduced his relative, Mr. Qi Chen, to consult me, complaining of 20 years of stomach pain. He was slightly addicted to smoking. He repeatedly decided to quit, but he was limited by the pain and could not succeed. I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Relieving Pill" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to cure the root cause of his pain, and to use "Digestive Tonic" to strengthen his diseased stomach. He also took "Testisan" to cultivate and supplement the special effects of smoking cessation. The poison was removed and the addiction was broken in exactly one month.</p>
<h3>Young People Saved from Venereal Disease</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhiqin from Hengchangli, Xiaodongmen, Shanghai, wrote: I am 18 years old. Because of excessive phimosis, I induced masturbation, which led to physical weakness and local developmental problems. I repeatedly took supplements, but to no avail. I wanted to undergo circumcision, but I was afraid of the pain. Last month, I sent a letter to this publication. I was introduced to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for diagnosis and treatment. He said that there was no pain at all because Dr. Zhan had rich clinical experience and was skilled in surgery. I immediately went to Dr. Zhan's clinic for treatment. I stated my intentions and received preferential treatment. He examined me in detail, and combined injection, electrotherapy, surgery, and drug therapy. There was no pain during the surgery, and the electrotherapy was extremely safe. I followed his instructions to take the famous medicine "Testisan", and it was very effective. There was improvement every day. In less than a month, I recovered completely. Now my whole body has regained development, and the local area is also very different from the past. I am grateful and have nothing to repay. I can only express my gratitude by publishing it in the newspaper to promote his benevolent spirit.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen from Zhengxianfang, Changsha Road, wrote: I have suffered from leucorrhea for four years. Sexual weakness and impotence have been unbearable. I have tried various medicines, with varying degrees of effectiveness. I was helpless and had no way to appeal. Later, I was introduced by my roommate Mr. Pan to Dr. Zhan Nianceng for diagnosis and treatment. He prescribed two famous medicines, "Testisan" and others, and also administered electrotherapy. In one month, the root cause was quickly eradicated. I have regained the health I never had before. It is no less than a new life.</p>
<h3>Disease Q&amp;A (Please provide a detailed address in your letter and attach return postage)</h3>
<p>This column is generally answered by famous doctors Wang Shiying, Ren Guoxiang, Yu Bofu, Qiao Wenbin, Mai Zhizhong, Zhan Nianceng, and the editors.</p>
<p>Induced by Bad Friends</p>
<p>Xu Zhangrong - Strict abstinence from masturbation. After kidney deficiency, there are symptoms such as back pain and neurasthenia. This is due to the weakening of the reproductive glands. Taking "Testisan" is the most effective. It can also regulate the pathogenesis and nourish weakness for pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis medicine can be purchased for two yuan. "Hemitol's Spermatorrhea Pills" are most effective for nocturnal emission and insomnia.</p>
<p>Athlete's Foot and Edema</p>
<p>Yao Zhongliang - This disease is one of vitamin deficiency diseases. "Digestive Tonic" contains a large amount of Vitamin C and can be used. Taking edema medicine at the same time is more effective. Each dose can be purchased for two yuan.</p>
<p>Leucorrhea and Underdeveloped Breasts</p>
<p>Dong Wenying - Noted. It is okay to take "Female Testisan" while injecting. Insomnia, excessive dreaming, underdeveloped breasts, and anemia can only be treated with "Female Testisan". You can take several boxes in a row to maintain its effectiveness, and you can cure it completely. You can also use "Leucorrhea Relieving Lotion" externally to treat leucorrhea.</p>
<p>A Collection of Miscellaneous Diseases</p>
<p>Sun Xianzhao - Your disease should not be washed with soap. Medicine can be purchased for one yuan. Bao Xinshan - Leucorrhea can be quickly cured by Dr. Zhan Nianceng with electrotherapy and medication. The foreskin can also be removed at the same time. Both are painless.</p>
<p>Please pay attention to the legal meaning for readers of this publication in this newspaper next Wednesday!</p>
<h3>Actual Venereal Disease Diagnosis Records</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic: 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road)</p>
<p>(1) Masturbation Harms, Kidney Deficiency, and Back Pain - Famous Medicine Saves, Medicine Brings Rejuvenation</p>
<p>Patient: Cen Zhongxian, 35 years old, from Guangdong, serving in an organization. (Complaint) - Back pain. (Medical History) - More than ten years ago, Mr. Cen was harmed by obscene books and inevitably contracted bad youthful habits, leading to kidney deficiency and back pain, dizziness and blurred vision, tinnitus and palpitations, insomnia and forgetfulness. He repeatedly took supplements, but the effect was minimal. After serving in the organization, due to heavy workload and excessive labor, his memory was sharply reduced and he could not concentrate on thinking. This spring, due to headaches and neurasthenia, and weak energy, he was introduced by Mr. Xu Weizhang to seek treatment at my place. (Present Symptoms) - Brain weakness. Insomnia. (Treatment) - I examined him in detail and found that Mr. Cen's youth glands showed symptoms of weakness and his spirit was also very sluggish. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Stenner's Testisan" from Chinese and Western pharmacies. Three doses a day, two tablets per dose. After about six weeks, he recovered his health, his spirit was full, his thoughts were active, and he could sleep peacefully at night.</p>
<p>(2) Nocturnal Emission, Insomnia, Premature Ejaculation, Physical Weakness - Treating Both the Symptoms and the Root Cause, Chronic Disease is Cured</p>
<p>Patient: Gu Xunru, 23 years old, from this province. (Complaint) - Nocturnal emission. Insomnia. (Medical History) - Eight years ago, he was induced by bad friends to commit masturbation. He felled himself every day and wasted himself immoderately, causing his body not to develop. It was too late to quit. Nocturnal emission soon arose. At the age of seventeen, it occurred four or five times a month. From the age of nineteen, it increased to more than ten times. He took various sperm-fixing and kidney-tonifying agents, with varying degrees of effectiveness, and it was still difficult to eradicate. The following spring, his mother ordered him to marry, and he found that he also suffered from premature ejaculation and insomnia at night. It was not until this spring that he was introduced by Mr. Lin Zhiyuan to seek treatment at my place. (Present Symptoms) - Insomnia. Premature ejaculation. Relaxation of the vas deferens. (Treatment) - I prescribed a large amount of "Hemitol's Spermatorrhea Pills" to treat his nocturnal emission. Before four boxes were finished, years of chronic disease were cured once and for all. I also instructed him to purchase "Testisan" from French pharmacies and take five boxes in a row. His body obtained good development, and his insomnia and premature ejaculation were also treated.</p>

<p>Tinnitus, Blurred Vision, Aversion to Labor and Movement</p>
<p>Premature Aging, Restoration of Youth</p>
<p>Patient Cheng Baokang, 42 years old, from Jiaxing. Holds an important position in a factory. Has always been of delicate constitution, so his health has been poor. He often experiences tinnitus, blurred vision, dizziness, and mental fatigue, and suffers from aversion to movement and labor, and weariness in everything he does. He has taken no fewer than twenty kinds of tonics, but none have had any discernible effect. Although only around forty years old, he looks almost over fifty. He feels breathless when running or climbing stairs. Starting last autumn, he also suffered from lower back pain, body chills, and tremors, falling into neurasthenia and becoming prematurely aged. This spring, introduced by Mr. Zhong Buyun, he came to me for diagnosis and treatment. I prescribed "Stannard's Organotherapeutic Extract" to him, two tablets three times a day. After taking about half a dozen doses, he immediately felt strong and healthy, restoring his youthful state. All his old ailments were completely cured, he said.</p>
<p>Frequent Seminal Emission Cured by Famous Medicine</p>
<p>Pale and Emaciated, Regained Strength</p>
<p>Patient Guo Shaotang. In his youth, he was led astray by bad friends and mistakenly committed masturbation, resulting in a thin and weak body and a pale and bloodless complexion. He eventually managed to quit on his own, but he still had several instances of seminal emission each month. After the autumn of his eighteenth year, due to an arranged marriage by his parents, he discovered symptoms such as premature ejaculation and spermatorrhea. The couple existed in name only, and their relationship gradually faded. Starting last year, his seminal emission became even worse, sometimes reaching more than twenty times a month. He took various medications to no effect. This spring, he came to me for treatment. In addition to using the latest scientific surgical electrotherapy to affect his nerve centers, I also prescribed "Simidu's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" to treat his seminal emission, and "Organotherapeutic Extract" to treat his premature ejaculation, anemia, and emaciation. Addressing both the symptoms and the root cause, it was completely effective in less than two months. Now he has gained weight, his muscles are full, his lower back is strong, and his spirit is revitalized. The harmony between him and his wife is unprecedented since their marriage, he said.</p>

<h3>Pork Prices Rise</h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>Pork prices have risen!</p>
<p>Not long ago, tofu prices were already announced to have risen, which had a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people. Now pork prices have also risen. Although pork is not as closely related to the lives of ordinary people as tofu, at the very least, this means that the opportunity for poor people to eat meat is becoming increasingly scarce. For the common people who originally had no fortune to enjoy it and live like lower animals, not being able to eat meat is a small matter, but the impact on the entire "market" cannot be ignored as an unfavorable phenomenon. Moreover, the reasons for the price increase are quite extensive.</p>
<p>The pork price increase is due to the recent resolution by the Fresh Meat Industry Association to announce revisions to the old price list established on May 30th of last year, with a price increase of four to seven cents per catty (approximately 1.3 lbs.) for each type. However, this approved new price list can only cover the cost. If there is no subsidy from offal such as pig lard and pig heads, it will still result in a loss. Originally, there were more than two thousand nine hundred and forty fresh meat shops selling meat in the city, but according to recent surveys, there are now fewer than two thousand five hundred. It is clear that the industry has been declining recently. Although this industry is already considered a waste for ordinary people (because they cannot afford it), it is still one of the main necessities of daily life and cannot be missing for a single day. The recent butcher strike in the United States that caused panic is a good example. Now, even the fresh meat industry, which is one of the necessities of daily life, is so desolate. The terrible future of the economy is imaginable.</p>
<p>The reasons for the increase in pork prices can be described in two major parts. The first is that the supply has been cut off, so demand exceeds supply, and prices have to rise. The pork in the city comes from Tongzhou, Rugao, Tai, and three other places. Now, because of rural bankruptcy, pig farming, which used to be a side occupation, can no longer be sustained by farmers. Moreover, last year's major flood made the environment even worse, and pig farmers even sold their sows to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the source can no longer supply the more than two thousand pigs needed daily in the city. This reason involves the bankruptcy of the entire rural area and the destruction of all natural and man-made disasters. All of this is restricted by the fact that the nation and the people cannot escape the iron heel of imperialism.</p>
<p>The second reason is the heavy burden of taxes. In addition to the pig price of sixteen yuan (per hundred catties) and three yuan for transportation, an ordinary pig also has to pay taxes to the two concessions, and the government's slaughter tax of thirty-nine cents, a health inspection fee of ten cents, and a slaughter fee of ten cents, etc. The cost is already about twenty yuan. A pig with a gross weight of one hundred catties only yields a little over fifty catties after removing the head and hair. With high costs, prices have to be increased. Although all of this cannot be described as excessive taxes and levies, it is enough to burden ordinary merchants and lead ordinary businesses to an irredeemable path.</p>
<p>The above two reasons are placing the pork industry in a dead end, but isn't it the same for other industries? Moreover, the necessities of daily life such as tofu and pork are also rising in price. What else can be imagined!</p>
<h3>Expulsion from the Clan (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>After breakfast, the Fang family members gradually walked towards the ancestral hall, resembling the Qingming Festival "gnawing on turtle bones" (Note). Before long, the assembly hall was already packed with a staggering crowd of people – the elderly, the young, those in short clothes, and those in long robes. Among them were also a few women and children. The Shengbing woman and Genfu were also pushed into a corner against the wall; but</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>they both lowered their heads, their hands tied behind their backs, their clothes askew, barely covering their bodies. Many malicious, mocking, hostile, and gleeful eyes were all fixed on them, as if to devour them.</p>
<p>Genfu's face still showed many finger marks, and the Shengbing woman's face was frighteningly pale, covered with tears, her eyes swollen like a pair of walnuts; as if she had a bellyful of remorse and indignation that had nowhere to vent. However, she ultimately did not have the courage to raise her head and look at these sharp eyes; now, she was a pending prisoner who had committed a major crime, and she could only await the moment of execution.</p>
<p>"It's really unfortunate that our Fang family has never had such a scandalous affair in generations. I never thought that this slut would tarnish the reputation of the Fang family." Jin Shengshu, wearing a chicken-catching gown, slammed the table and raised his voice before Lai Tou Agen even began to report the process of catching the adulterers.</p>
<p>"Today, we have caught the thief red-handed, caught the adulterers in the act. The evidence is all here. As long as Elder A Xing says a fair word, I will be worthy of my deceased brother and the ancestors of the Fang family." Lai Tou Agen said to Elder A Xing with considerable politeness, looking quite proud.</p>
<p>Dozens of pairs of eyes shifted to their faces and bodies in unison, as if trying to find something or search something out of them. Elder A Xing kept puffing away at his pipe, and after hearing Agen's words, he spoke in a peaceful tone, like a judge:</p>
<p>"Originally, at such a young age, you could still walk in the open and look presentable. Anyway, no one forced you to remain chaste. Now, you have ruined your own reputation, not to mention that you have also tarnished the reputation of our Fang family..."</p>
<p>The matter was finally decided like this—Genfu, according to the opinions of several young people, was originally to have characters branded on his forehead with incense sticks, but after his bitter pleading and Elder A Xing's mediation, only half of his ears were cut off as a warning. As for the Shengbing woman, she would naturally no longer be allowed to bear the surname Fang from now on.</p>
<p>She walked out of that cold and desolate ancestral hall door, the sound of mockery sending her off from behind—she felt that her life was over from today onwards. Where should she go now? She stood by the long pond, looking at the black oily surface of the water, tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>Note—After the Qingming Festival, after offering sacrifices to the ancestors, everyone in the clan can have a meal together.</p>
<h3>Fortune Telling</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>A friend who likes to play music and I went to the City God Temple to buy some musical instruments, and then stopped at a tea house to rest. There were very few tea drinkers in the tea house, probably because it was not yet the time for the market to open. We picked a seat by the window and ordered two pots of tea. After the waiter brought over the face towels, a man in a worn-out Zhongshan suit immediately came to pester us. He was the most famous fortune teller in the City God Temple. He held a smoking a cigarettes box in his hand, which acted as his dining utensil, with two lines of characters written on it that I couldn't clearly read, probably something like "Better Than Zhuge Liang" or advertising terms for good and bad luck. He stood in front of us and pleaded in a pitiful tone, "Gentlemen, please help me out, have your fortunes told. It only costs twenty cents." The best way to deal with those "gentlemen" is to ignore them, as if there were no such person standing in front of you, let him brag and lie on his own until he has exhausted his skills. But when the fortune teller saw that we were ignoring him, he didn't use any江湖 terms (江湖 refers to the itinerant life of entertainers or fortune tellers), but instead told a pitiful tale like a beggar, saying that he hadn't eaten a grain of rice all day. So I began to shift my gaze to observe his face, which was a terrible face like wax paper, with a pair of sunken eyes like dead carp. Looking at his face, he not only hadn't eaten a grain of rice, but perhaps he was suffering from the stimulation of another kind of poison. I gave him twenty cents and waved him away. I didn't want to save such a person, I couldn't bear to look at that terrible appearance. After receiving the twenty cents, he sent me two sentences after all, "Sir, you have a kind heart, may Heaven bless you with wealth and good fortune!" He shrugged his shoulders and slipped down the stairs of the tea house.</p>
<p>But the second one came right after. This "gentleman" was more presentable than the previous one. He had a standard outfit—a blue robe and a black jacket, a worn-out felt hat clamped in his hand, and another hand supporting a large walking stick. His face was plump, with a short mustache on his upper lip. Walking with a sway, not to satirize him, he should already belong to the comprador class of Shanghai. He stood in front of us and greeted us as if we were friends, "Have you eaten?" Then he tilted his head, as if thinking, "Gentlemen, you haven't been to the temple in a long time?" Then he smiled, "My memory is quite good, huh!" He tapped the floor with his cane, making a rattling sound.</p>
<p>From my memory, I had never met such a witty fortune teller, otherwise, I would have developed a good feeling towards them. In doing things in society, one often feels that the hypocrisy between people is too deep. One has to go around when speaking, and many enthusiastic and earnest words are used to deceive the other party. The fortune teller didn't start with advertising terms, which made people break the image that all fortune tellers are annoying. I couldn't help but nod casually; but this meaning was not answering him, it's been a long time since I've been to the temple, but praising his art of fortune telling.</p>
<p>In this way, it was as if we had greeted a familiar friend. He sat down in the seat opposite us, still supporting his cane with one hand, looking quite dashing. He repeated, "It's really been a long time since I saw you gentlemen at the temple." Suddenly, he noticed the musical instruments next to our seats and immediately changed his tone: "Gentlemen, you are extremely elegant, drinking tea and playing music. One should find happiness in this way"... (To be continued)</p>

Therefore, they determined that Tang Xing had been rescued and decided that he had not escaped from the city of Beijing.

<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Jin Cheng's New Lineup</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Jincheng Grand Theater on Beijing Road has been committed to promoting domestic films. Although the production of domestic films is not large, and demand exceeds supply, there is often a shortage of films. However, the theater would rather extend the screening period of domestic films. Only when absolutely necessary would it easily screen Western films. Even the opening of "Modern Times" was due to the request of Lianyi Company, and the screening period was set for eight days. After that, it will still focus on the screening of domestic films. The domestic films that the theater will soon release are briefly introduced below:</p>
<p>"Waves Washing Sand" - is the first sound dialogue feature film by Lianhua Film Company, starring Jin Yan and Zhang Zhizhi, directed by Wu Yonggang. The whole play tells the story of human hatred and jealousy on a solitary island. It is novel and unique. It is scheduled to be released at the theater on the 28th.</p>
<p>"Incarnation Girl" - Produced by Yihua, starring Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin, is Fang Peilin's directorial debut.</p>
<p>"Diamond" - A detective adventure drama, ten times better than "Jade Horse". Starring Wang Zhengxin, directed by Xu Xinfu. New Star film.</p>
<p>"Peach Blossom Spring Dream" - Produced by Xinhua, starring Han Langen and Liu Jiqun. It is a very meaningful comedy, directed by Yang Xiaozhong.</p>
<p>Other films such as Lianhua's "Lost Lamb", Star's "Begonia Red", Xinhua's "Night of Joy", Yihua's "Father and Son Heroes", and Tianyi's "Mr. Wang's Biography of a Knight Errant" will be released at the theater one after another. Movie fans will surely have a feast for the eyes.</p>
<h3>"Little Earl" starring Freddie Bartholomew and Dolores Costello</h3>
<p>Released at the Grand Theater</p>
<h3>Rumors of You Guanren Starring in "Night Meeting"</h3>
<p>"Night Meeting" was originally a script written by Yao Suifeng for Huang Naishuang during the heyday of Star Film Company. As a result, "Youth Line," which he wrote and directed, was a complete failure, losing a lot of money, so he resigned from the Star Film Company. "Night Meeting" was unfortunately shelved in the Star Film Company's script department. Later, Wu Cun tried to direct "Night Meeting" several times, but each time it only whetted Yao Suifeng's appetite. Now, Li Pingqian's father intends to direct "Night Meeting." This time it seems likely to become a reality. The female lead is probably still Huang Naishuang. Who is the male lead? Some say Xu Manli's "foreign language" You Guanren. Although You Guanren worked at the "soft film representative" Yilian Company and made something called "Rocking the Mountain," because he only made this one bad film before his career ended, You Guanren is still a stranger in the minds of movie fans. Tell readers, he is from Guangdong and speaks good "Cantonese Mandarin." Remember that a certain newspaper once published Xu Manli teaching You Guanren Mandarin, and published something about Liu Na'ou and Xu Manli. Then, You Guanren's ability to play the male lead in "Night Meeting" may be due to Liu Na'ou's influence. If that is the case, You Guanren's "Cantonese Mandarin" will become a unique feature of "Night Meeting."</p>
