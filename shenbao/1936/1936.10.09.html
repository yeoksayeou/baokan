<p>規矩堂非法買賣案是一件國際的業產買賣。這業產是外商於一九一三年以規矩堂名義，用三百餘元的代價向我國一李姓者購得的。當時汕頭的外商以英德兩國佔多數，規矩堂的會務亦以該兩國商人佔勢力，因此規矩堂團體的組織和堂址的業權俱先後向英德二國領事館掛號注冊。業權的契據則存於英領館。現會務由英商德記洋行總經理英人魯濱遜主持。該項業產係在外馬路市政府左邊角頭，現編門牌一六三號，面積五十八方丈點七，蓋有樓房一座。</p>
<p>最近因會務不求發展，且舊會員大多返國，遂將該項業權全部售與日籍民王振謙，得價三萬二千元正。於本年七月十八日簽訂契約過銀清楚。當時因主持人英商魯濱遜赴滬，所以託德記洋行華經理李啟明經手辦理買賣手續。契據上的中人雖書明係盛明石，實則仍係李永明負責做中人者。這件國際的非法買賣事前既未遵照國際慣例先請我政府受買，待我政府表示不願接受時，始自由轉讓。所以規矩堂此項轉讓業權的行為，實在是非法的。即使我政府表示不願接受以後，業權經過了自由轉讓，仍為外人所購有，該外人也應當即呈報該國領事注冊，然後由該國領事依照國際公法，以正式手續轉睛當地政府備案承認該地為租借地，俟年期滿後，由當地政府買受地權，收回業產，因為外人是不能享有永久產業的權利的。對於這層日籍民王振謙也沒有照辦，所以也是非法的。而且當規矩堂將業權轉讓與王振謙時，也沒有點明舊契，所以最初發生交涉時，連業權是屬規矩堂尚成問題，最近始由英領事賈德樂搜出在一九一三年規矩堂向國人李姓者購地的舊契，這舊契如果不合法，則該業權仍屬官有，還是非法的。不過現在既有舊契為證，規矩堂的業權問題自容易解決。但是即使證明業權係規矩堂所有，而轉讓時不先請我政府買受，竟擅自由轉讓，在規矩堂方面當然是非法的買賣。至於日籍民王振謙不依照手續呈請該國領事轉請我政府備案，當然也是非法的行為，不過尚不是本案交涉的癥結所在。</p>
<p>市政府事後發覺這非法買賣案後，於八月二十六日即將經手人李啟明拘辦，後由李覓保並具結『遵於兩星期內將業權購回』。於是此國際多角關係的交涉便發生了。結果，具結到九月七日到期，李啟明雖多方設法贖回，俱遭日方拒絕，只得自己投到，另覓舖保再展緩兩星期。但是二次展限至九月二十一日又到期，依然沒有解決。在這期間英領事冷落慢待德樂於八月二十七日正式向市府抗議，先提出種種證據，證明此業權並無非法；繼謂此案正在交涉，突然拘辦與此案無關之德記洋行華經理李啟明，實有失國際禮貌；末謂此案要已由英商魯濱遜負責，要求將李啟明具結取銷。然俱無結果。繼英領事又會同美領事親赴日領事館晤日領事探詢是否知悉此案，日領答以未據報告，又不得要領。到九月十八日下午三時許廣志洋行炸彈案發生，英領事繼日領之後又赴市府交涉，請求取銷第二次李啟明具結，使得恢復自由，設法交涉贖回，市府僅允再展綏數天。如不贖回，決依照民政廳指令，嚴辦經手人。大概此案解決甚難，是否能順利收回，殊成問題。因為王振謙購買這業產當非出於已意，恐怕是代『友邦』出面購買而已。現在『友邦』已將規矩堂佈置竣事，不久汕日居留民協會及日本俱樂部即正式遷入，將來市府及市府後面的公安局必遭監視無疑。並且日本小學也適望衡對宇，尤有許多行動上的便利。可以歸結起來說，這非法買賣案並不是單純在法理手續上爭執主權，其實是一個軍政上的問題。</p>

<p>— 李聖五</p>
<p>（三）關於鄭公使公文中所論互惠一點，白納氏駁詰最力。白氏謂：中·美兩國於一八四四年，一八五八年，一八六八年，及一八八零年所締條約，均未明白規定因後的之締結而廢除前的，試翻閱以上各的之內容，卽可察出互惠原則，絕無存在之可能，蓋兩國之行政結構及權力之行使，根本不同故也。截至一八六七年中國人民僑居美國之權利尙未明白規定，此可歸諸美國之自由主義，人民政府，及寬大立法，曾未與任何國人以入境之限制。然則中國之情形如何？任何人可以答出，與美國絕不相同。中國邊境猶如築有高牆，他國人均不能自由越過。至一八八四年美國人民始依據條約享有特權——凡某一類美國人可於種種限制之下前往中國旅行經商。在種種限制之範圍以內，美國僑民尙不能自由選擇地點，建築住宅，敎堂·醫院·墓地·以至於開店經商等。卽在此等情形之下，一八八四年中美條約第十四條尙定明美僑在某種情形之下所受損害，中國政府不能負責賠償。</p>
<p>（四）白納氏重新伸述美國政府對於外僑受害不負責任的傳統政策，並指明一八五零年之暴動案「攻擊西班牙領事及僑民」與羅開斯普林事件截然不同。卽對一八五零年事件，美總統亦未承認美國負責，不過為保持美。西友誼，並顧及領事之權利，自動予以賠償而已。</p>
<p>（五）美國政府盡力保護外僑及鎭壓暴動一事，已為中國公使所提及，然則中國僑民性情之特別及其習慣之殊異，常使美國政府於行使保護權時戚到複雜繁難。此等特殊習性，致與美國公民及其他居民不能接近，而常處於孤立地位，因此極易引起種族觀念，尤其與他國僑民為從事美國人民所不欲担當之粗笨工作，常立於競爭地位。且中國僑民為絮持其孤立主義，擇居於偏僻區域，此等地方行政權威既甚微弱，種族觀念又覺深刻，而勞工衝突亦常發現，使政府當局時時戚覺煩難。</p>
<p>最後白納氏謂，關於羅開斯普林案，伊個人相信必能勸促總統提交國會予以考慮，使無辜被害華僑獲得救濟，亦藉贖地方政府未能防止於事前及設法救治於事後之慊愆。但如此處置之結果，不能認為美國政府履行法律義務，亦不得視為將來援引之成例。</p>
<p>白納氏之上項公文與克利夫蘭德總統（President　Cleveland）致國會之公文同時送達於國會，國會於一八八七年二月二十西日通過賠償案，為羅開斯普林受害華僑，美國政府付給中國政府以十四萬七千七百四十八元七角四分賠欵，由中國政府散發與罹難華僑及其親屬。此案遂歸結束。</p>
<p>試將此案與紐阿連案解决之經過，比較觀之，則前者之案情重而後者之案情輕；紐阿連案中之意大利僑民有激起民衆暴動之行為，而羅開斯普林案中之中國僑民全係無辜良民：紐案之解决迅速，而羅案之解决遲緩；紐案之外交辯詰簡單，羅案之辯詰繁重；以上係其不同之點。兩案之最後解决，均由美國政府担任賠欵，但均經否認美國負有法律責任，且懲兇一項要求，均未接受，此其相同之點。以當時中國國勢之窮蹙甚於今日，中國公使鄭藻如氏對於此案之交涉可謂相當勝利，轉考外僑在吾國蒙受侵害之交涉經過，則不禁有天上地下之感矣。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 王漱芳</p>
<p>（一）新生活運動與童子軍</p>
<p>自蔣委員長倡導新生活運動以來、全國各地、均熱烈奉行、各地方負推行的責任的、除了憲兵警察以外、就是童子軍、單就首都一處而言、在一萬一千多勞動服務團團員中、童子軍要佔一半以上、其他各地情形、亦大致相同、由此可見童子軍在推行新生活運動當中、地位的軍要、我們研究　子軍所以成為新生活運動的重要幹部、是有兩種原因、</p>
<p>（一）童子軍的組織、訓練、及紀律、和勞動服務團有許多相同的地方、而童子軍所須要達到的標準、和新運會所規定的「整齊·淸潔·簡樸·動勞·迅速·確實」六個原則、是完全相同的、所以童子軍的行動、很容易和新生活運動打成一片、</p>
<p>（二）新生活運動最注重的、是改善風俗習慣、而改善風俗習慣最易著手的時候、就是在幼年時代、新運會把童子軍作為推行新生活運動的幹部、一方面可以使童子軍的本身、一切行動、更加健全、成為社會的表率人物、另一方面、因為童子軍的組織、是極普遍的、藉此可使新生活運動的力量、普及於全社會、尤其重要的、今日的童子軍、就是將來社會的中心份子、影響於將來社會的進步、是異常重大的、所以各地的新運會都以童子軍為推行的幹部、</p>
<p>（二）此次服務工作計劃</p>
<p>这次童軍總會乘本屆全國童軍大檢閱及大露營的機會、規定在首都舉行大規模的勞動服務、有兩種意義、</p>
<p>（一）把全國各省市童軍的服務精神、介紹給首都的民衆、</p>
<p>（二）以整個童軍的力量、來協助首都的新生活運動、</p>
<p>这次服務的範圍、非常廣大、城內有國府路·中山路·中山東路·太平路·朱雀路·建康路·白下路·利濟巷·科巷·洪武路等處、城外有苜蓿園·後三莊·中莊·前三莊·營房·孝陵衛·鍾靈街·五顆松·馬羣·等處、雖然服務的區域很廣、但服務的目標、却是十分集中、在城內注重規矩和淸潔兩項、在城外注重衛生運動、參加服務的人員、在城內有男童軍一千零三十八人、在城外有女童軍五百五十二人、这次大規模的出動、在首都是空前的、</p>
<p>（三）對於參加服務人員的希望</p>
<p>毫無疑義的、這次的服務要給首都的民衆一個重大的感動、同時使首都的新運得着一個迅連的進步、本人在各位尙未出發工作之前、謹致幾點希望、</p>
<p>（一）潔市容　在服務　的區域內、對於店舖住戶的、門面、自牆壁、櫃台以及招牌等項、要逐一詳細檢査、如有損壞或汚穢、要勸其修補或洗抹、在鬥前人行道要勸其隨時洒掃、以保持整潔、</p>
<p>（二）改善交通　在城內　服務區、除各大馬路的交通、仍由崗警指揮外、其餘各小巷、如科巷、利濟巷及洪武路等處、平日各種車輛往來甚多、時常發生車輛擁擠、交通阻塞的現象、要協同憲警、加以整理、以改善各該處交通、</p>
<p>（三）注重衛生、在城外服務區的工作、是衛生運動、應特別注意的、是廚房的淸潔、和飲料水源的淸潔、關於第一點、要把廚房淸潔的方法、吿訴每一家庭的主婦、關於後一點、要吿訴村長、注意飲料水源的保護、</p>
<p>（四）實施感化、在服務的時間、態度要和平、解釋要詳明、要以誠懇的精神感化對方、使他們自然而然接受勸導、並樂意實行、</p>
<p>（五）以身作則　在服務的時間、服務員的態度行動、最足以引起市民注意、所以各服務員要服裝整齊精神飽滿、以作市民的表率、關於整潔門面、廚房及掃除人行道等項尤其要以身作則、躬自倡導、俾市民有所模仿、而宏行效果、</p>
<p>謹就臨時感想所及、提及數點如上、貢獻於我參加服務的童子軍、</p>
<p>大會會徵</p>
<p>（說明）</p>
<p>一·箭表示向上環表示團結結弓，表示努力。</p>
<p>二·三環與十二枝箭，代表中國童子軍誓詞與規律。</p>
<p>三·以環束箭表示團結一心衆矢難折之意，箭在絃上，表示準備之意。</p>
<p>四·全徽表示中國童子軍，遵守誓詞規律，團結一心，努力前進，準備復與民族之意。</p>

<p>— 濟武</p>
<p>勞動服務這個名詞有人譯作「義務勞動」、是由德意志Reichs　Arbeits　dient抄襲來的、他們利用國家的靑年、直接參加國家社會的建設事業、國社黨起初的規定尙屬志願工役性質、迨至一九三五年後改為强迫工役、凡是男女靑年於十七歲至廿五歲之間、一律須服工役半年、工作的種類不外墾地·築路·造林·園藝·改良交通、預防工事、搭造營房等、此種工作皆由上午七時起至十時止、下午二時半起上課或運動、晚間舉行遊藝唱歌音樂映影等聚會、筆者前年在德國的時候、參觀了不少這樣的靑年營房、看到他們這樣靑年訓練國防化政治化的設施、所得的印象最深、</p>
<p>蘇聯革命之後、要使國家工業化Undustrialion的時候、他們也是利用「先鋒團」Pioneers靑年運動、直接參加國家工業化的大運動、他們訓練這些靑年的先鋒Pioncers佩帶科學的工具、負着探險的精神、到各鄉村各山林中調査俄羅斯境內所有的物產原料、數年的工夫也有了警天動地的成績、</p>
<p>中國的地大人繁、論到一切文化、交通·農·工·商業·落後是人所共知的、一切的一切、全都還不如德意志和俄羅斯、然而中國一般的靑年缺乏領袖指導、尙在醉生夢死、漠視國家的需要、而一般敎育者、仍然免不埠抱着傳統敎育的方法、忙着辦理一些不合時宜、不切實際的敎育、談到這裏、眞是令人痛心、</p>
<p>敎宵部為適應國難時期之需要、於本年十二月徵集各方意見、聞達一百餘件、並召集會議、商訂之後、已擬訂特種敎育方案、該方案之基本目標為、</p>
<p>一、注重體格訓練</p>
<p>二、改進精神訓練</p>
<p>三、在知識與技能方面、注重生產能力與特種敎育、</p>
<p>在此方案細目之中、有「規定靑年勞動服務辦法」一項、聞現已規定辦法為、</p>
<p>各中等以上學校學生除分期輪班從事重大之勞動服務外、更應利用假期、星期日、寒假、暑假及其他例假之一部份時間從事下列工作、</p>
<p>（一）參加當地公益事業及各項建設工作、如植樹一防災·救災·工程·農藝·調査戶口、識字運動、公共衛生運動、新生活運動等等、</p>
<p>（二）參加軍事後方勤務之實習、如防空·防毒·警衛·民衆組織、糧食管理、運輸管理、以及電話電報機之裝置使用等等、</p>
<p>（三）參加學校內之勞動、如校舍淸潔、校園整理、修墊體育塲、修理用器等等、</p>
<p>本屆中國童子軍全國大檢閱及大露營期中所舉行的勞動服務、其內容係以童子軍指導規矩淸潔、女童軍指導農村衛生、用意極善、良以中國民衆的對於一般規矩與淸潔、大率視為無關緊要、允以農村之視衛生、更以為無足輕重、遂致整個社會、充滿蕪雜·汚穢·病苦·陰森·絕少新興氣象、此在一般的敎育程度上言、固屬過於幼稚、而其之所以積重難返、實亦因指導者的缺乏、我們固然知道、要單使一千個童子軍和五百個女童軍去指導全國的民衆規矩淸潔、和農村衛生、當然是不可能的事情、然能山於此項運動的提倡、使全國童子軍找到一條新服務之路、以現有五十萬童子軍和女童軍的力量、其在一般民衆間發揮的效能、實屬非同小可、如更以五十萬童子軍的人數為不足够、則鄙意以為能由中央統盤籌劃、使中央與地方獲得切實的聯絡、把政治國防、與靑年訓練打成一片、組織中央靑年勞動委員會統轄一切、分全國為若干區、在各區內由地方政府及學校聯合成立勞動服務部、推行當地建設工作、如此、則勞動服務的推行、或可更有意義、更有效果、</p>

<p>除了日本隊以八比零被意大利慘敗外、第二週中還有秘魯對奧大利那一塲是値得寫紀的、他們在九十分鐘完結後是各二言和、照例是延長時間、卒被秘魯攻入二球、以四比二結束、但賽中秘魯的拉拉隊曾跑入塲內毆打奧隊球員、奧隊軍後乃據情上訴、指秘魯隊為野蠻恐嚇、致其球員均無心戀戰始遵敗續、經委員會一度會議、判奧隊得直、下令重賽、可是秘魯隊不服栽判、認為不公、臨時放棄、奧隊乃於死中復活、白得凖决賽權、這件風波便是這回錦樓全部競賽中唯一的憾事、</p>
<p>到了第三週祇　下意挪奧波强旅、便是準决賽了、意大利對挪威一塲、是在八月十日舉行、那天恰巧是我們足球隊鼓後留居柏林的一天所以大會會塲裏近十萬的觀衆、也有我們的影子參雜其間、（第一二週的比賽都分別在柏林其他的塲地舉行、到了準决賽才用大會當中的球塲。）那一天天氣晴朗、也沒有風、就使有風恐怕也吹不進那鐵鑊式的運動塲裏、塲子上的綠草如茵、平軟到好像彈子桌一般、綜合那一天的天時塲地、擁擠的觀衆、在烈的吶喊、和一百二十分鐘的精彩球賽、確使人欽羨興與、而値　紀念的、上半時意以一零佔先、下塲挪威打回平手、九十分完結、兩無勝負、乃延長時間、卒為意大利攻進一球、獲得决賽權、這决意隊在萬目睽睽之下、和經過了一番警誡、踢來已减少無限的粗蠻、因此反覺對美國第一週角逐時精彩得多、無顧球兼顧人、踢球兼踢人之弊、挪威隊也實力相埒、後防維護週密、（兩隊戰略將另為文紀述）可惜前鋒力稍差、不能利用機會、個人的傑出者、挪威的中堅眞有一夫當關、萬軍難渡之雄威、意大利的中鋒和左後衛、也是球界中之皎皎者、不可多得的人材、總括而論、那天的表演是給予各方以特特殊的滿意、那天的結果是解决於一刹那間的機遇、因為彼此的實力是旗鼓相當、誰能抓得住幸運之神所給賜的機遇、便誰佔最後的優勢、</p>
<p>十一日凌晨、我隊離開柏林了、以後的比賽祗有忍痛割愛、怨怨自己眼福太薄到後來靠報章的消息、和友人中目擊者之追述、知到以後的三塲比賽、也極劇烈精彩、無一塲不經過延長時間才判別高低、聽說决賽那天、意大利隊為着錦標在望、近在咫尺、引起了他們的野心、粗暴的故態復萌、結果他們雖榮膺覇主、但也得不着大衆的讚美和同情心、</p>

<p>五洲大藥房創立三十週暨新厦落成紀念特刊本公司三十週紀念辭  董事會　　本公司創始於公元一九零七年即遜清光緒三十有三年。維時未依公司組織也。公司之正式成立。實為民國二年。業務漸繁。資金亦歲以增厚。由十萬兩而五十萬兩。而一百萬兩。而一百五十萬圓。以營業之擴張支店遍於海內外。此殆非始顧所及。其及此。微我政府與全社會人士之匡扶輔導。曷克有之。乃者新厦落成。適逢成立三十周年。追維既往。勉策方來。敢述所懷。冀愛我公司之諸君子繼續加惠焉。　　本公司三十年之歷史。有足使吾人永永無忘者。第一厥惟創始時期之領袖。得人。夏粹芳先生雄才大略。發縱於先。項松茂先生繼之。心精力果。銳意經營。此兩先生者其才識其懷抱其魄力。皆大過人。萃兩賢於一堂。後先輝映。赤心合作。以底於成。進於昌大。本公司不拔之基。有由來也。　　第二歷年營業政策。純采進取主義。自立求生主義。絕不蹈襲故常。任何艱困以淵沈之智勇克勝之。務從自身。發展所長。决不於依賴中求生活。苟有一分餘力。必根據穩健方針。充分發揮。以求功業之發皇光大。决不逸失時机。例如最初販售外葉。籌備既達相當程度。立郎從事自製。製藥以外。兼事製皂。而推及於一切化學品。而太和藥房。固本皂廠。亞林奧水廠。中藥興記香皂廠。南洋木塞廠等。先後讓歸我有。我查以誠摯之態度。充實之力量。迎而受之。實地立脚。遠處著眼。凡此前人賦予之遺規。吾人所當敬謹秉承。相興永矢勿諼者也。　　而尤使吾人茹悲忍痛之餘。不敢不和淚濡墨。廣告我天下後世者。則先總經理項松茂先生。當一二八之役。為冒險援救第二支店職員而遽以身詢也。松茂先生苟有一分愛惜自己生命。漠視同事生命之心。則先生可以不死。及其被據。苟不顧國民身分。不惜國家體面。或亦可以不死。先生之死死於救護我公司之同事。死於為中華民國之爭取人格。我公司苟有一日生存。當永永紀念先生。我同事苟有一分良知。當永永感動先生。　　同人低回先烈，珍重遺徹。深懼大任之弗克負荷。重念邦家多難。整個的世界經濟。已陷入不振之勢圍。此局部工商業雖復不絕其蓬勃生機。而時勢偪仄。任重能鮮。內省實不勝其慚悚。用是掬陳二義。開誠心以求教益焉。　　我國衛生學說。輸自外洋，其事業亦倡自外人。今政府勤求上治。特設專署。全國承流。推行恐後。工欲善其事必先利其器。木公司既獲見重於社會。凡關於衛生藥劑。日新月異而歲不同。自當勉荷一分子之責任。協力供應。俾無匱乏。此本公司所應自勉者　　吾國西藥向皆取之舶來。奮有藥材。雖甚夥顧。顧皆不予深究。最近乃有以科學方法研究藥物者。如北平研究院與上海中法大學合辦之藥物研究所。上海雷士德醫學研究所藥理部。上海自然科學研究所藥物化學部。北平協和醫學院藥理部。或重藥物生理。或重藥物化學。類皆於藥物有精切的貢獻。千年豐當之天產。至今日而效用大彰。夫研究發明學人之責。至於製造推行。事關企業。工商界敢不起而承其乏。此本公司所應自勉者二。　　凡此。皆本公司今後開誠接受之新使命。同人所敢公告於社會者。凡本公司營業方針。壹以科學為總根據。以人羣幸福為總歸宿。自科學日新。人事日紛。物質上之需求與供應。亦日繁而日複同人願至奢。力至薄。惟有呼將伯於父老兄第之前。而請更懸一義以自勉。　　語云：利之所在。人盡趨之。惟迎之以公。則其所翕受也厚。惟處之以平。則其所保持也久。本公司同人基此信念。對於任務。决不敢稍自怠忽。以貽股東諸君羞。顧深維服務人羣之大義。雅不欲規取無度之潤益。重負創始諸公之遺歡。竊願本公平原則。邐以精誠兩字。為處理公司對內對外一切業務不刋之準則。過去三十年。亦旣仰承衆力。定此初基。予同人今日以有力之憑藉。同人敢不從極度感奮與悚惕之餘。日夜　皇。以期在進化不已之世界潮流中。繼續獲得尺寸之地。以自效於國家。於社會。惟邦人君子。進而教之。本公司之既往與今後  總經理項繩武　　本公司創立於公元一九〇七年。即民國紀元前五年。至民國紀元前一年。始由先總經理主持。視事之後。以普通商號不足提倡國貨發明製造。乃於民國二年。邃改組為股份有限公司。至民十盤進德人所設固本皂廠。民十二。價買福州路河南路角之基地。此後四五年間。又絡續盤進其他工廠多家。至民十八。擴增股份總額為一百五十萬圓。一二八之役。先總經理冒險援救北四川路支店同事。不幸遽以身殉。自先總經理詢難後。重事會公推繩武承其乏。同時推高翰卿盧志學二先生為常務董事。協同繼續先總經理未竟之志。并積極進行頂定計畫。於是設第二廠於安和寺路。製造甘油。設第三廠於恒業路。製造原料。增加固木皂產量。每日自一千箱至三千箱。拆卸福州路舊屋。改建十層新廈。又添設廣州支店及本埠靜安寺支店。今總計本外埠支店共二十家。特約領牌凡九十餘處。殆遍乎全國及南洋羣島矣。　　以上所述。悉屬本公司三十年歷史之梗概。然而今之東亞大局。陰雲密佈。大有山雨欲來風滿樓之勢。當此危急存亡之秋。惟有沉毅堅定。整齊步伐。聽命於整個之國策。本吾人一貫之精神。作更進一步之努力。俾漏　得以減少。國家經濟得以充裕。以盡應盡之責任。因此不揣綿薄。最近主張。　　一·努力製造將製造已有成績之藥品與肥皂。增加其產量。優越其品質。推廣其銷路。以供我國家民族之需要。　　二·發揚國藥希望與學者合作。運用科學方法。將吾國數千年來固有之國產藥材。加以提練。攝其精華。製成新醫適用之良劑。以代舶來品。冀挽入超狂瀾於萬一。　　三。積極自給各種藥物。在平時巳屬必要。若在非常之際。更屬關係至巨。故最近擬就應用最廣需要最多之衛生用品及其他藥物。趕先製造。企圖自給。即以此為吾實業界倡。而鞏固國家自給之基礎。　　四·勵行採用國產原料在最近數年來。本公司各廠所用之原料。凡吾國所有而能適宜於製造者。殆已全數採用國貨。但鑒於目前之局勢。怵於未來之厄運。根據自給原則。此後益惟絕對採用國產原料。然深望農礦界製造界有男猛之進步。相當之出品。足以應付吾人之需求。　　五·减低價格西藥來自海外。價率奇昂。國人往往為財力所限。不克購用。本公司一面努力製造並注意於新的發明。同時即乘公平之原則。不敢偏重牟利。决將出品减低價格。竭力使其大衆化平民化。　　綜之。本公司此後營業方法。惟以科學為根據。人羣幸福為歸宿而已。明日為本公司舉行暨三十周紀念暨新廈落成典禮之日。練自忘其淺陋。粗舉綱要。深維志願宏而力量弱。務望社會人士。隨時力予輔助而指導之。幸甚幸甚。贈言　　黃武培　　一二八之設。强敵陵轢。淞滬崩爛。其間以大企業而橫被摧毀者。曰商務印書錧。夏屋灰燼。機鐵鎔鑠。損失之鉅。幾難數計。以大企業家而慘遭戕賊者。曰五洲大藥房總經理項松茂先生。見危授命以業殉身。迄今遺骸不返。豈惟一姓之慘痛。亦人世之奇哀也已。四五年來。商務當軸。振衰起疲。已逐漸復其舊觀。無待贅說。五洲大藥房得松茂先生哲嗣繩武兄為之繼。諸董事又皆勞　以赴。於是　焉勃焉日效力肝　。今且以十層新厦落成聞矣。百尺竿頭。進步不已。忻慰自無可量。獨念吾亡友松茂先生不及見此。重可悲也。　　吾以為公司之組織。猶之乎國家也。範疇雖異。致力攸同。故奠基之始。必先固其本。浚其源。以始簡之餘功。謀百年之大計。及其日漸進展也。機攜當益求其活動。管理當益求其縝密。據固不可旁落。利必歸之大公。庶幾指臂相連。聲氣無阻。進可以謀事業之穩固。退可以克環境之困難。方松茂先生之遽遭不幸也。全埠震驚。國人駭走。斯時公司之情勢。不難逆想。顧不旋踵間。部署大定。秩序釐然。三軍之帥雖奪。衆人之志如城。蓋誠信能相孚於平時。肝　乃共傾於逆境。用能無損毫末。屹然不動也。比歲以還。商市凋落。公司廳號。覆沒者相繼于道。其長袖善舞者。亦皆從事緊縮。退藏恐後。五洲大藥房既遭人事之劇變。復罹不景之氛圍。獨能妙運一心。擔拄現狀。且從而發揮光大之。蓋其根本逈異於恒流。絢爛乃臻於極致。初非有倖而然也。國人乎。企業家乎。觀於五洲。當知所自反矣。　　顧吾猶有一言以為五洲諸君告者。公司之設。固以增加生產。廣沾利潤為直接之目的。但自另一意義言之。則福利人羣。增厚國力。亦為大企家應有之懷抱。年來各地衛生事業。已在萌芽。故西藥輸入。為量極鉅。加以國人畸形心理。樂用外貨。於是附隨西藥而來之化裝用品。亦極可觀。故一方須極力改造。銳意模枋。以與舶來品一較短長。一方尤在研究固有藥材。攝其精華。宏其效用。以為西藥之替品。此應致力者一也。新醫新藥。政府雖在提倡。顧公醫之制度未行。社會之救濟未備。貧苦病者。視新醫師仰不可攀。服新藥力所難逮。醫吾無論焉。若失藥。則當如何減輕成本。使取費不致過高。當如何便利平民。使實惠沾於大衆。此應致力者二也。國步日艱。外侮日亟。我縱委曲求全。人未必野心可戢。大禍之來。直迫眉睫。藥用材料。在平時巳屬必要。在戰時尤所急需。故必於不妨營業之下。就需要最多。應用最廣之各項藥物。先事製備。以持萬一。此應致力者三也。綜此三者。或為藥業公有之責。或為政府所宜預防。陳義雖不免過高。需要實甚形迫切。以五洲曾受　之痛。又執藥業之牛耳。艱鉅之責。當較他人多所負荷。茲對新厦既成。又值成立三十週年大廈。五洲有特刋之輯。而徵吾一言。用成斯以歸之。　　馬相伯　　余生平所見工商業盛衰之陳跡。不可以數計。然其衰也。固有所以致其衰者。其盛也。亦必有所以致其盛者。非偶然也。距今卅年時。余過福州路棋盤街。見轉角處有二層舊式市屋數間。顏曰五洲大藥房。詢知總經理為鄞縣項松茂先生。初以為不過普通商店。未之異。乃未幾成立有限公司。德人斯設之固本皂廠。吾國人所設之中華興記香皂廠。亞林臭水廠。南洋木塞廠。寗波東吳鎮公濟藥棉廠。本市太和藥房。及昆連其公司之一帶鄰屋。悉歸所有。支店遍全國。營業及海外。遂成偉大之規模。一二八之變。松茂先生。因營救其僚友遇害。董事會以其長子繩武君繼任。推舉高翰卿廬志學兩君為常務董事。合力繼續松茂先生未竟事業。增加出品。添設廠店。以公司原址改建大厦。蔚然大觀。果操何術而能至是。夫自立則强。依人則弱。務實則固。蹈虎則危。五洲公司注重於自己發明製造。不注重於販賣他人貨物。故能自立。不受操縱影響。出品皆按科學方法。不肯絲毫苟且。故能務實而使信用卓著。則致盛自有其道。豈偶然哉。今當新厦落成。又值卅週紀念。余祝五洲公司之蒸蒸日上。亦如新厦之繼長增高。自卅週以至百千萬週於無窮。莫不各有最盛之紀念。爰誌數語以頌。　　蔡元培　　海通以來。外國利用機器以其成本較輕生產特多之物品。侵入我國。與我固有之手工產品相競爭。我之失敗宜也。五洲大藥房主人有鑒于此。仿用新法。製藥製身。歷三十年之久。製品之精良。已受全國歡迎。再由此而進步。則其提倡國貨挽問利權之功。更未可限量矣。敬於新厦落成之期。為綜核已往之成績。而祝將來之發展。　　汪伯奇　　自西人醫學流傳東方以來。日本人士之致力於斯者。孜孜研討。恒不惜舉其畢生精力以投之。彼邦政府。亦獎勵有加。對於醫理之改進。新藥之發明。期有以追踪歐美。獨步東亞。故日本之醫藥界。於數十年問絕程而馳。駿駿乎有後來居上之勢。反觀吾國。故步自封者有之。俯仰由人。漫不經意者亦有之。其輸自海外之藥料。及衛生用品。歲有驚人之鉅額。此雖不同於服飾奢侈之具。而影響所及。直接加速國民經濟力之衰退。間接亦足以養成國人之惰性。非細故也。曩者夏粹芳先生。獨具灼見。於民國紀元前五年。設五洲大藥房於滬上。忽忽三十年。由一普通商號。擴展而為規模宏大。迭有發明。支店普派全國之有限公司。今則巍巍巨厦。且屹立於河南路福州路之轉角矣。其慘淡經營之過程中。前任經理項松茂先生。致力獨多。不幸一二八之役。松茂先生為營救支店。身狗喜業。刻由哲開繩武先生繼其喜。與董事長顏福慶先生。常董高翰鄉盧志學兩先生。協力以成松茂先生之遺志。公司前途之釜見昌明。自可跂足而俟。茲値舉行三十週年紀念。兼為新厦落成慶典。誠滬上罕睹之盛會。伯奇不敏。謹祝主其事者。繼續努力。展足邁進。以廣其功。俾良相之事業。一洗民族落後之叢。匪獨競購於商戰巳也。　　馬蔭良　　大發明家安迪生氏有言曰。凡事業之成功。其由於天才者百分之一。而由於血汗者。可百分之九十建築物。今證以五洲大藥房二十年來之進步。由一普通商號。進而為鉅額之公司組織。以迄於今日之夏屋渠渠。蓋益信其為勞力汗血之代價。而此言殊為不虛。試一迴溯故總經理項松茂先先之努力經營。孟晉建設。持籌握計。挈領提綱。以至從業諸伺人之克勤克恒。盡於厥職。始得厚植其基礎

<p>申報文藝專刊慈善家與痧藥水  羅烽　　前幾天又受了一點兒感冒，犹不顧吃什麼藥，我也不願意買藥，其實我要有綫，我也會住病院的－不過，自己感覺病的來頭很不輕，而且再不能支持下夫了，於是，我偶爾想起我的小皮包里還有一瓶，僅僅有一瓶三年前那位慈善家施捨給我的痧蘗水。不知道是不是藥的效力，喝下去之後，週身的熱度，居然减退了不少。但，無論是不是，我是感謝那位遙在數千里以外的慈善家的，因為，對於我，確是一個很恰當的救濟。　　是的，熱退了，頭腦也漸漸地清爽起來。這樣，倒使我想起三年前，關於那位慈善家的一椿事情，於是，我把它寫下來：　　慈善家並不是他的專業。那時，他正在松浦市政局當總務科長，同時，因為慈善家交際很好，不，正是因為本質慈善的緣故，被我們的鐵路局長聘來做秘書－這是兼差－這樣一個機會，使我們常常接近。　　按理說，一個小職員本來沒有跟一位秘書接近的資格和機會的，然而，這位慈善的秘書却與眾大不相同，他無論對誰——富貴，貧賤，一向是以慈善為懷，不分彼此的，也就正因為他能這樣，慈善家勝利了，他不單在鐵路的小職員　中，就是在他直轄的松浦市政區內，貧賤的居民　中，同樣的獲得了可佳的影響，换句話說，就是得到了一般人的擁護，不用說，這類擁護不是由於政治影響而來的，也不是由於運籌路政而來的，而是由於他的慈善。　　一個五十幾歲的老人—頭髮跟鬍髭都蒼白了，白齒已經脫落兩個，－待人接物，一味用孩子的稚氣，總算是難能可貴吧。雖然，我自己已經不是一個孩子；但，在這個社會里，我討厭的是：上了年紀的人。拿什麼比喻他最為恰當呢，彷彿是一棵朽燭的老樹上寄生着的，有毒的蘑菇吧。可是，我們的老人本是蘑菇，而是一支靈芝草，這就是他所以可貴的地方。　　他是精於製造印象的人，他好像碧空中一朵浮雲，千變萬幻的，繪成了美感的雲團，有時，竟使人墮入那變幻里，憧憬着他，憧憬着他的事業。　　一個老人。　　一個慈善家。　　一支靈芝草。　　春天，應該是靈芝草最蓬生的時候。春天，是雜疫流行的時候。春天，也正是我們的慈善家發洩他的慈善的時候。　　他和知候鳥一樣，秋末，他從北方回到他的故鄉，浙江紹興－待來春，他又回到北方來。當他回去，我不知道地带去什麼，然而，富他回來，就带來很多很多的痧藥水。　　於是，雜疫好像是痧藥水的消　者，源源而來。　　於是，慈善家也就變成痧藥水與雜疫的介紹人了。　　一天，我從馬家船口到松浦的上班車上，又碰見了慈善家，當然，他又是以難能可貴的孩子的稚氣和我寒暄起來。之後，他突然非常憂虑地對我說：　　「看你的氣色很不好，有病嗎？］　　「我嗎？總而言之：一年三百六十万天，沒有舒服的時候！」　　「唔呀!年紀青的，這現象最可怕哩！」　　「可不是呢，没有辦法。」　　那末，我倒想介紹你一種藥……」　　慈善家仰着和藹可親的臉兒，等着我的回答。然而，我怎樣回答他呢？我的確有病，這種流行的生活病，自然不是用什麼藥能夠療愈牠的。可是慈善家故意誤解我的話，因而，我也不得不故意，不，也可以說是無誠意地回答。　　「什麼藥呢？」我想說：「痧藥水嗎？」　　慈善家介紹給我的，和我所想最說的並不兩樣，而且，他一定要奉送我一打。他答應明天給我帶來。繼而，他說：　　「　說，尊夫人，報館做編輯，真嗎」？　　「是的」。　　「這真不是一件容易的事哩，尤其是一個當女人的」。　　「並不需要多末大的才能。我想在南方是頂普遍的吧」？　　「唔……不，不，南方有這種女人，也是一樣出奇的呀」！繼而，他又說：　　「我有一件事情託你，你是可以辦得到的，而且　事，無論從哪一方面講，都是一種公德……你不願意做一種公德的事情嗎？如今的流年和人心已經壞　無可再壞了!……這見怪：做公德的人太少嘍了」！　　「是的，你說我可以辦到什麼？公德，我並不反對」。　　「很好啦，關於我奉送疲藥水的事情，請你夫人寫一篇稿子登在報紙上。你知道嗎。窮人有病都買不起藥」。　　「是」，我仍舊冷淡地回答，「不過我很失望，她是　文藝的，新另有人負責」。　　「唔，這……編的是什麼文藝呢」？　　「小說之類的東西……」　　「那中好啦，現在就請繼寫一篇小說」。　　「對不起，他會編，而不會寫哩」。　　「唔，這……」　　他比　更失望。然而，仍舊是和善地嬉笑着。　　第二天，這位慈善家給我兩瓶痧藥水，而後，他等我解釋：　　「對不起」，他用我回答他的話，起頭說：「本來還有很多，昨天我不在家，來了　人，一下就拿光了。這兩瓶，還是我發現抽屜裏　出來的，你先用，另一箱子打開，再補送你十瓶」。　　老年人辦事，這樣認真，恐怕世界上，實在是不大多兒吧！　　又是幾天以後，在馬家船　　　　　　　　　　　　路局長和市政局長聯名介紹我們這位慈善家施捨痧藥水的事情。我竊喜這種宣傳的效果，一定比在新聞紙上的力量更大。　　果然，不多久，這位慈善家的名字，簡直像他的痧藥水似的，到處流行着。尤其是在窮人區域裏，那名字幾乎被人們供奉起來。　　什麼名字呢？不是某某總務科長，也不是默默慈善家，那是：　　救苦救難的活菩薩。　　然而，自從慈善家發生了賣家應該說　不　的　　事故以來，這世事很讓我捉摸不透。試想：一　赤貧的人們，被活菩薩從苦難中拔救出來，反而列舉許多罪狀——一，侵蝕水災救濟金；二，經良為匪，希圖得賞；三，霸佔公田，暴力拆除民房自種菜園……——聯名向市政局控告他，這是應該的嗎？雖然，他們這個聯名沒有獲得什麼效果；可是這位慈善家的聲譽。因此而消耗大半了！　　事後，我問他：　　「你對於這次意外的不幸　也好　是　　　　很難捉摸似的搖了搖頭」　　「我沒有什麼……我永久是待人寬容的，我永久用我的真實的心去感化眾生……不過，這次，他們給我的刺　太深了，有什麼辦法呀」！　　窮人，是不是如慈善家所說：很少有「良心」的呢？因為我本身還不是一個太窮的人，所以一時還不可證明。惟有慈善家自稱：他的心，是真實的，我倒不敢深信，這是因為他答應補送我的一瓶痧藥水，從春到秋，還不曾奉送給我。偷營  唐弢　　—一個人的自述—　　　這是一個夢，但是，也是一個事實。　　迎着晚風，浴着月光，我在一個斜坡上走着，這斜坡一段高，一段低，我時而微傴着身體，時而又挺直着脖頸走近山邊，我走得有點氣喘，短衫給汗淌濕了，晚風一吹，冷油油滴黏住了背部，但我毫不覺得難過，我的心像一團火在燃燒，也沒有想到應該給想到應該給起了泡的脚休息一下，野棘刺破了我的皮膚，鮮紅的血流下來，流下來。彷彿是迷路者所做的標幟。　　我奇怪：我竟有這樣多的血，我奇怪：我的血竟會這麼地紅！我奇怪，而且擔心，因為我不知道，由於這血的灌溉，這地面會生長出什麼東西來。　　牠也許只助長了一些蔓草，也許只滋養了一些一籐棘也許，這藤棘和蔓草，還要刺破後來者的皮膚，使牠們也流出血來。　　無數的後來者的血，一定會栽培出鮮豔的花朵來。我相信。　　穿過了許多平坡，我高興地走着，驕傲地踐踏着脚底下的藤棘，踐踏着脚底下的蔓草，雖然我的脚面時時被刺出血来．當這血還沒有乾去的時候，我已經到了山脚，趟在我的前面的是一座崇高的山嶺，在冷冷的月光下面，牠顯得非常深密，非常甯靜，我沿着山脚，去找尋上山的路途，去找尋大青石板。我所碰到的盡是些褂滿着鱗苔的消極擊，我小心地蹋着走。也許　鱗苔里正躲着一條毒蛇，也許這　茅里正躲着我們的敵人，他們的槍口正瞄準着我。但我並不害怕，我的心像一團火在燃燒。我終於找到了那塊青石板，在青石板後面是一條被野葛掩沒了的小徑，我用兩手搭地，緩緩地爬上去。披開了那葛籐，那紫色的小花，但也時時把自己的身體隱藏在葛場的下面。　　我的手全被刺開了，但我並不覺得痛，我怎麼會覺得痛呢！山势越來越削，攀着葛藤，一點一點挨上去。有一次，竟攀住了一條白花蛇的尾巴，那油滑陰冷的感覺，使我猛的縮回手來、同时，也使牠很快地逃了四去。　　小心地爬着，爬着，爬得那麼熟練，那麼勇敢，簡提使我忘記了目已是生着兩只脚的人類；忘記了是在深夜的山中；忘記了是在敵人的禁地里，我一直向上爬，約莫過了兩里多路，我已經到了山腰，望得見對面　盤里的燈火，我鬆了口氣，抹去褂在臉上的汗珠，繼續爬上去。　　到得山頂上的所頹敗的土地堂里，已經過了午夜了，月包非常暗淡，茂密的樺樹林里傳來了　厲的鶴聲。看看身邊帶着的鐵路錶，知道還沒有到約定的時候，我　點着帶來的手槍，子彈，號砲，而且還有功夫去察看手上和脚上的血痕。我非常高舆，因為是等着我的一　號砲，弟兄們就要開始狩獵，是的，是狩獵，看這些野獸們落在我們的手里！　　但是，但是以後的事情恕我不再講述了，因為我實在不敢相信這事情的結局。一個「水客」  斐兒　　我不知道他四做什麼名字，雖然我　他的面孔好像很熟識。　　那是在上溯占卑河的時候，在K.P.M輪船公司的一只小輪中。從他的面貌合舉動上看來，我確實地知道　是上下於這河流的「水客」。——這便是那班隨着輪船，帶着零星的貨物，漂流於南洋　島之間，到處把貨物輪運和販賣着的「水客」。　　「你的面孔很熟，我好像認識過你似的。」在輪船里閒得慌，一有機會，便好他攀談起來了。　　這個穿着棉絲底衣，遷羅綢褲子的瘦漢，皮膚被赤道的陽光蒸成赤褐，一聽見我的話，便皺一下眉毛，遲疑了一下，說道：　　「我也是。你先生可會　過巴達維亞的？」　　「我去過：我是四年前到過的。」　　他笑了。　　「呵，對了，你是曾經住在源豐的許先生。」　　於是我也記起來了。這個人在四年前是源豐的店夥，姓李，名字呌做—呌做什麼，可又想不起了。　　我却說道：　　「源豐現在很好吧？」　　「我也不知道，」他答道。「我也離開了兩年了。那時確是很好。頭家辦了一批私貨，賺了一筆錢。—可是我也在那時走開了。」　　「為什麼？你不是頭家的老夥友？」我頗有點驚訝。　　「老夥友？」他冷笑道，摸一摸頷下的粗鬍子。　　「你先生以為老夥友便是老朋友麼？不，不！我現在更相信貧窮的新朋友才是夥伴，什麼頭家東西，開小店子做工賺飯吃，倒可以做老朋友；生意一發達了的人，倒不容易做朋友的。」　　我不明白他的話，我以為這是他的牢騷；他定和源豐的老板因為什麼事情衝突過的。　　「徐先生，我老李走遍荷蘭，什麼事情沒有做過。便是到蔗園　蔗去吧，也有碗飯去。他源豐頭家有什麼了不起，還不是賺我們的工發財？呵，呵，怪我看新聞紙，怪我學認識字，怪我參加年青人的「中華社」。這是什麼話？難道我跟他學個番鬼子簽宇，有事的時候到瑪腰或洋鬼子的地方簽個字便行？說瑪腰討厭「中華社」。這和我有什麼相干？鬼子的洋機器我會不知道？他說瑪腰商怒，我的職業便會保不牢。難道我認識字讀新聞紙也會是一種罪過？人家可以到大學堂里去唸書，我連唸新聞紙也不行，老源豐不　識字，可以發洋財。我却覺得我一輩便吃了不認識字的虧：在唐山，一點小田地被人家用一張契據騙奪去了；走南洋却被人家在一張賣身契上變做了「猪仔」。我說，我一定要　助「中華社」，難道「中華社］那班年青的伙子教同胞識字也是一種罪過？到後來源豐發大財，——正是一年前，他同瑪腰結了親，他的地位隱　了，他便拿了一百盾，教我回唐山去，他說道：　　「老李，大家是老夥伴，你離家鄉久啦，也應該回去看看去。」　　「什麼？」我喊道，「你現在生意好了，用不到我這個會做苦工的人了！－你難道不知道我唐山沒有了一點田地，運一間草屋子，一個親人都沒有嗎？」　　「我把一百盾錢拋還給他，我馬上捲起行李走了。我想不到「中華社」那些年輕的窮夥伴倒會帮我的忙，　們一盾五十仙地，最多是三眉，凑起來幫我走。我想到占卑河這里　許多從前從「豬仔」出身的窮夥友，我便跑到這里來，這些人也帮我做成了一個小「水客」，靠着代人家搬運貨物賺「水客」，撈一碗飯吃。你先生想想看，我永遠會相信一個人交了好運，便不够做朋友的；——你想想看，源豐頭家在擺貨攤時，和我多麼好，真是老兄弟啦，亦現在—倒是像我這班人，天不怕地不怕的，會吃粗飯，也會挑上他媽的一二百斤的，才是好朋友！」　　這個人一口氣說完了他的遭遇，使我連我連一句插嘴的地方也沒有。我倒也很有興趣地　下去，因為這種「人生哲學」倒也反有牠動人的地方。　　可是我還愚笨地問道：　　「走水路不是够苦了麼？」　　他用粗壯的手掌向空中一抹，快樂地笑道：　　「海關的留難，船員的欺負，商人的鄙吝，有些時還怕從船上喪失了身了，……可是聽牠吧，忍不住的時候便幹癟的活計。你想我將來難道也没有亭福的時候；至少我的夥伴將來也有人會享受的。」直至我從占卑河的弗拉埠上岸，這個人已先我走了。在他從不里洛埠上岸的時候，我看着他穿着一雙陳　庚的橡皮鞋子，肩七背了重負，而兩隻手上又提了很多精細和笨重的東西，堅毅地從烈陽下的大馬路上走去了。我看着他提到他的瘦長而堅強的背影從我的眼前消失的時候。然後我的心上不知怎怎樣浮起了一個愉快的感覺，好像這個瘦漢子會經給過我什麼東西似的。離情  櫻子　　決定了自己的行期以後，不知怎地，突然對著一個有點住點住腻了的歸化城和參厭了，的那座嶒嶙的大青山，感覺到戀戀不捨了。這或許是人們所謂的「離情」吧？　　「離情」？對於我這漂泊慣了的人兒有什麼離情可言呢？雖然，這一次是一個較遠的行程而又是走不少日个的。但於我這年青人究竟算不了什麼的，我所眷戀的是我感覺到：我在他日歸來時，這一個塞外草原中的大城市，會變成一個什麼樣子？我像就要別離一個環着三期病的愛人似的，心中湧出了無限的悽愴，知道這愛人於我歸来時會成了怎樣的一個東西？廢墟？「王道樂土」？想到此，我這一顆年青人的心，怎能不對這塞外草原感覺到深深留戀呢！人，終竟是有感情的動物呵！　　待到對快要離開的城市感覺到眷戀時，草原上的一切和廣闊的天空對於我也是親切的了。這幾天，每天從舊城到新城，或從新城到舊城，不管是清晨或是快近黄昏的時候，仰起臉看去，就是那晴朗的，碧藍的海樣深的天空，幾片白雲飛渦来，飛過去，秋風微微拂着面頰，馬路兩邊高大的楊樹，拖下了寬大的影子，遠遠的村莊被週圍的莊稼包圍着，顯现着付野田園平靜的景象，甚至於那毛幟廠大烟囱發出的凄切的嗚嗚聲對於我也是親切的了。（未完）白德吶是怎樣的詩人？  雷石榆　　如果談起現在蘇聯的詩壇，恐怕白德吶（Bednui）這位詩人會最先被你　出吧。是的，白德吶是最典型的最天才的詩人，他得到伊里奇的　　和民眾熱烈的愛戴決不是偶然的。　　白德吶已經過二十五年的作詩生活了，他從最混亂最艱險的時代而通過大革命，新經濟政策和第二次五年計劃快要告竣的現在，都是一貫的勇敢地壯健地，在蘇聯全民眾的行列之中充任唯一的喇叭手。　　白德吶只是專門於詩的詩人，也可以說最擅長諷刺詩的詩人。他在一九一一年露西亞無產階級運動之中，以「只是一個，可能的活動的形式底人物」而揮着詩筆登場了的。他為了使運動的廣大的頭腦的精確，視野的拓大河透視，　寫解答　面的政治的課題底在「真理報」，濟維埃齊達，陸續發表寓話詩，新聞小品，警句（短嘲詩）。在今日，庚寫長篇諷刺詩和朗吟詩，他站在廣大的集團的聽眾之前，歌唱那單　而　　　詩。「四出關於政治的生活之最重要的問題吧！」　　他始終這樣努力過來的。　　「力強在目的意識，明瞭的時事批判性，戰鬥的布爾什維克的方向——這是白德呐的詩之最特色。」（文學新聞的社說）　　因此他拿起特長的武器，在市民戰爭的時代，白俄將軍，立憲民宁黨，社會革命黨，孟雪維克山帥富農等做了他打靶的標的。同時他歌揚自己方的軍馬，　讀英雄主義和獻身，詰責卑怯者和脫走兵。作復興時代，社會主義的建設時代，他嘲笑官僚主義，生活　式上的資本主義的殘存物，教會，和在國外的白衛軍等等。　　為了在廣大的人民大眾之前，獻出最迎合的武器，也即是在明瞭單純的内容上表現言語的單純性和人民性。他研究民謠，傳說口碑，费心於把牠跟自己的創作緊密地聯結使詩的各行緊張起來的勞力，而目拼命地努力使自己的詩之內容到達幾百萬讀者的意識。因此，他又不忘却批判的攝取古典的寫實詩底成果和十九世紀六十年代的德謨克拉西的詩底傳統，而補養自己的詩創作之無線豐實的收獲。因為他把握着單純性和大眾化的詩形式，依他諷刺的才能，把他對政治的諸課顯之解答和批判的睿智，滲透於寓話詩，流行歌，諷刺詩等諷刺的內容裏了。譬如遠在「二月」和「十月」之間，他寫過有名的寓話詩「兵士耶西卡，　銅鐵」，及「太太」等許多流行歌。在「太太」這首歌唱戰爭的流行歌中，插下「這是真的嗎？太太啊！的諷刺的反復，語是非常有趣的。格連斯基內閣對德國宣言出兵時，也寫過流行歌的有趣句子，報答格連斯基。　　自由？但不說是什麼自由。　　那自由不是人民的自由。　　然他的詩人的活動達到顶點的是「戰　共產主義時代。而至一九二三年的軍五年、祭，他竟以詩人的資格受授了榮譽的獎章。看看全蘇聯中央執行委昌會的．節表彰的話吧：　　「君的作品單純地，誰也看得懂的。而且非常有力地燃起勞働階級的心臟的革新响火把，在鬥爭之最困難的時代，你加强了精神的健康。」　　是的他的精神是非常健康的，譬如一九二〇年他用明快　雄渾的　律寫過勞働的讚歌，看了以下的幾行詩句使暸然。　　上前！上前！上前！上前！　　所有同伴喲，咱們的看守！　　昨天手槍－今天　鋤！　　工咋吧，同伴哟！　　但那决不是無技術的標語口號，他　單純性中還抽象地剖開現實的本資。如：　　那裏面注入活生生的流，　　在沙地上　殖田園吧！　　……　　從每個角落把可愛的露西亞，　　恢復於開花的樂園吧！　　……　　但蘇聯的第一次五年計劃的四年完成和第一次五年的建設當中突起狂飚似的斯達哈諾夫運動的飛　的偉大的成功，在這樣的英雄的現實之具體發展和高度地立體的展開中，詩人白德吶，那作品之偉大的單純性，人民性，高明的政治性，正確的時事批判性，精神的健康性，深刻的諷刺性，通渦他新寫實主義的創作方法，和愉快明朗的韻律的言語而創造更複雜，更偉大的主題之積極性的詩歌是當然的。現在他既已向世界送出一部巨大的著作了，那是露露宗教的長篇諷刺叙事詩集「聖基督傅」。於是Lesou這歷史上的假空底人物，在詩人的筆下用有機的形剖露那一切的醜惡了。這宗教不但是新文化路上的一大障碍物，而且也是帝國主義一向採用的文化侵略工具。同時詩人還依藝術家的感覺，把那「最神氣活現的基督」和「正經的福音書」顯示於地上。白德呐的福音書的自體可在下面幾行的目的下考究出來的。　　救援百姓女，　　斬斷百姓女的漫漫黑夜，　　親切地握着百姓女的手，　　為着領她走向白天的世界……高爾基語錄  林　　人生是一種認真的遊戲。　　人生的意義，存在於向着目的飛躍的美和力裏面。所以，實生活的每一瞬間都應當有各自的高尚的目的。　　許多人的不幸，是由於他們錯把自己看得高於實際而生的。　　人在有所希冀，有要去的地方，有要得到的東西的期間，是得意的：但是一旦達到了目的，就平平凡凡地終結了。　　人的價值，是依據他對於實生活的威力的抵抗程度來决定的。　　實生活的　智，常常比人的　智深刻而且廣泛。　　人都想要用兩個銅板去買五個銅板。　　人時常在寂悶煩擾中做出罪來。　　自己满足的人，是在社會的胸中硬化了的瘤。　　在地上，善人比惡人的苦痛多。　　現在的世界，指着惡漢說是紳士。　　幸福的人是萬人之敵。　　惡人常常是長壽的。　　在人　中有時會有性格非常複雜的人。雖然無論要把他呌作什麼都無不可，祇是他不適於人這個名字。　　善的事物的短促，正如美的事物的稀少。　　好的果實不早熟。　　生就　伏的東西，不是不能飛　的。　　不知道明天應該做什麼的人，是不幸的。　　世上紳士不少。然而世上所需要的乃是完全的人。　　人的行為有兩面。顯露的一面是虛偽，另外隱蔽了的一面　是真實的。　　有在泥土之中生活着的人，然而却比穿着錦繡玩逛着人皎潔。　　人是對於目前並不留意的小善，一旦過去了就想要看看的。　　無論在善事中，或是在惡事中，人都還不是那全部。　　生活不能夠奈何那知道自己的價值的人。　　世上再沒有比人的行為動機那樣重要而且有興味的東西了。　　在這個世界上，一切事情都是相對的。因此，在這個世界上也就沒有使得人無可奈何的絕對的逆黨。　　和敵人的關係，正是飢餓者和飽食者的關係。　　人都當作口頭禪似地說着四海同胞這句話，可是誰也沒有從戶藉薄上來證明過這件事。　　一切的事物都有終結。這就是人生的主要特質。</p>

<p>康健之路  康健醫藥社主編淋病實驗淋病指迷  美國性病學家權威著Moller　Neelsen　M.D原著日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯醫師節譯　　淋病患者所需要的一個根本的解決方針　巴黎有十三萬淋病男女獲得美滿的效果　　有時候交接蕩婦以後，發現自己染有淋病嫌疑，便應該設法挽救。因為一個人被淋菌侵染上身，在短時間內即會很快的發生各種變症，絕種滅嗣，而且，愈來愈兇險。絕種滅嗣　　據今日最進步醫學的考察，以令人殘廢的關節炎，和易致暴死的心膜炎最為普遍，這種險惡病變，都是淋菌由尿道侵入血液內所致；而傳染淋毒後即隨時有發生這種變症的可能。所以這嚴重的事情，每個患者都應加以深切的研究。須知道治療愈早，危險愈少，而痊癒也就更速。要緊的是患者必須在一個時期內嚴守衛生的方面，如避免勞動房事，和辣酸食品，這樣，才能便於用藥。　　淋病無論男女，或急或慢性，並不是不治之症，合樸根大學（Hopkins　Vniversity)花柳病大學教授倍魯倫博士（Dr.B　erlander），曾經在他所著「淋病自己治療」一書中記載他的實地調查，他宣布法國巴黎患淋病的人—包括睾丸炎和攝護腺炎的淋毒不孕症，以及婦女白帶不孕子宮炎等，統計共有十四萬二千人之多，其中以服蛋白體黃色素合製劑「克淋儂」治愈者，佔十三萬四千〇〇八人。而婦女的白帶大多都兼用『卡而雪地』為坐藥。的確，我自己也曾用此法供臨床試騐，大抵一兩月左右，就可以收到最美滿的完全效果。彌補性生活缺陷　久婚不育之救星  Wellesley教授著留俄勞動醫科大學楊道南譯　　　　一個健全而無缺陷的人，他的身體必然是發育完全的，精神愉快的。他對於性生活，也恒感到滿意的安慰。這原是上帝賜於每個人類的必有幸福。可是有許多的人，他並沒有這種幸幅，他所受的是無限而難擺脫的痛苦，悲哀，好象上帝沒有給他幸福而祇給他痛苦似地。其實不是，他們失掉這幸福，和招來無限苦惱，是在青春期，因性的衝動，遽加手淫摧戕，和色慾過度，把性部的組織失去健全的機搆，於是一切性生活的不满足的症狀，都全部出現了。　　我們最所常見的性生活缺陷症狀，厥為生殖器矮小，陰莖勃起力减退，不能執行性生活的任務s、而遺精滑精，見色流精等，這都是性生活缺陷的鐵證，他如失眠頭痛，心悸健忘，悲觀苦悶，做事易起厭心，腰痠脚軟，這都是神經衰弱的表徵。凡是患了上述的症狀的。他對於生殖力是很脆弱可憐的。我們往往看到這可憐的一筆，他如何感到性的苦悶啊！　　關於此類因性生活的缺陷而來之久婚不育者的挽救，據瑞典生理學家Modesims和Nightinga-le教授在Philippa　大學醫科演講時，對於這個問題，有反覆詳盡的討論，最後結論，謂凡患了性生活缺陷而致久婚不孕的，可服大量的「補體康」，他說「補體康」係德國梅倫氏發明，為用青春期動物提出的荷爾蒙所製成，對於改造性組織而促內分泌旺盛，有絕對的偉大作用。彼曾用「補體康」治愈結婚十年不孕者五人，六年不孕者二十餘人。婚後三年不孕者則近百人。自然這許多不孕者，都是起於性生活的缺陷的。因此歐美各國，因增人口，和强大國民體格的緣故，「補體康」一藥，遂大為風行，各國政府皆特許免收關稅進口云。－節譯美國强族雜誌一卷二期。（譯者按：余在俄國勞動大學醫科讀書時，俄國政府巳將「補體康］一藥免稅人口矣。）遺精救星手淫遺精　婚前速治  陸軍醫科大學畢業　宋忠鈺醫師　　遺精不治等於每日流血　並能使甜蜜愛情破裂　　手淫惡習，一般人皆在發育與未婚之前犯之。因旦旦而犯，所以精關鬆弛，射精中樞神經脆弱，失去正常作用，故一觸卽洩。快感漸漸減低而致消失。此症必須在婚前治愈。始有望於他日夫婦愛情維　不墜。若不早治，一待婚後，則病勢必增。因對方感不到性的滿足，愛情決裂，致不可收拾矣。　　處置此等手淫遺精疾患，以內服「耐而斯遺精片」最為有效。因此片有强固精關，增强射精管之管轄力。並能戢止手淫惡念。故能迅速治愈。凡是婚前犯有手淫遺精者，速宜服用此片，以收根治之效。惟遺精已誘發神經衰弱，性機能不振，則可同服「補體康」。以滋補神經，强壯體力。鞏固性機能。並能助制止遺精之患。故兩藥同服，最為相宜。補體戒烟之福音  楊道南醫師　　凡是要戒烟的人，大多懷着恐怖的心理，以為會引起宿恙，痛苦難免。或者因體格的不健全而不勝戒時的痛苦。所以依我多年的臨床實騐，要解決這兩項難題，祗有施行補體戒烟法，方才能顧到戒者體格，免除痛苦，而得堅强戒者的意志。　　補體戒烟法是德國梅倫博士所發明，即用『補體康』所含荷爾蒙和蛋黃素，壯補戒者之身體，使其增强抗烟毒之力量，一方可防疾病之侵蝕，故戒者絲毫不受痛苦，而且安全有效。有固涵秋者，四十八歲，吸烟已十五年，癮量甚大，因體虛恐不勝痛苦，故思戒未能，後經余用上項補體戒烟法，內服『補體康』，為期不過二月，烟毒盡絕，毫無痛苦，而體重體力，亦獲大增云。怎樣避免攝護腺按摩痛苦  姚菊嚴醫師　　久延失治有不妊危險　神經衰弱尤當注意之　　淋毒性的攝獲腺炎，是淋病中最易遭遇的續發症。牠的症狀是小便艱難，會陰與肛門有牽引的鈍痛，而且有時腫大。我們在平常的療法中，有攝獲腺按摩的手術療法，但有許多人因為是神經質的，偶一觸到牠的攝獲腺上，就有呌苦不迭，甚至失神。但此病若不行按摩療法，又該怎樣呢？據我的經騐告訴我，如果遇神經質的病人。可內服德國「克淋儂」，自然可以避免，因為「克淋儂」有增强全體的細胞抗淋素，而起喰菌的微妙作用。並有偉大的消炎防腐利尿的功效。所以患攝獲腺炎肥大，或慢性攝象腺炎時都可服「克淋儂」。即可在短期內徹底根治。假使此症不速就治，那就有成攝獲腺漏的危險。此時對於生殖十九都無希望了。不過有許多神經衰弱而患此者，可與「補體康」同服。自然可收相發揮藥效。有相得益彰之妙。下圖係表示醫生替病人按摩攝獲腺時的情形。姚菊巖醫師淋病講座　　（診所）：四川路甯波路轉角　（診時）：上午十時至下午六時　　　　制服執拗性的急性淋——急性淋因何變成執拗？　　平常所說之淋病執拗性，多指慢性的淋病而言。因為慢性淋之成因甚多，有因誤行粗暴手術而來者，有因服治標之局部透膜殺菌藥而來者，情形複雜，變症多端，苟非耐心而精細之治療，則鮮獲根治者。惟通常治急性淋，如能行對症療法，無不迅速收效。但有一種患者，身體虛弱，當其染病之初，發作甚遲，發作時亦無一般急性淋之苦楚，例如龜頭包皮，雖亦腫大，但並不十分疼痛，惟小便則甚艱困，淋系膿血亦不斷流出。時有陰莖勃起之遺精。精神十分困　，此等病患，恒易誘發急性之輸精管炎，精囊炎。故其危險性，實比一般之急性淋為重大。故其治療之法，以殺菌補虛並重。　　住圓明園路之季學李君，兩個月前宿娼，至二星期後，始發見淋病，並不感到十分痛苦，小便困難，曾注射自家淋菌苗無效。尿道膿血淋漓，淋系如絮。經余用科學方法檢查後，斷為體虛白濁，此症十分執拗，非作徹底根治不可。遂囑其進服「克淋儂」使在體內發生抗淋喰菌作用。以利尿消炎鎮痛清濁。同時又內服「補體康」俾滋補體力，而强壯神經，一方輔以長短波電療。交互醫治。至四星期左右，淋病遺精，同告痊癒。盡「克淋儂」本有抗淋喰菌作用。得「補體康」同服，尤能盡量發殺菌威力。故能降伏此執拗之淋病也云。肺癆常識肺癆嫌疑之危機與轉機  前南洋醫科大學教授　源和醫師　　（診所）四川路甯波路轉角　（診時）下午四時至六時　　乾咳獲痰多有促成肺癆發生之危險　將成熟期青年更須注意肺部之强健　　不必說，肺病乃是一種很廣泛的傳染疾病。據歐美醫學專家的調查，從十一歲到二十五歲的人，都有肺癆傳染，約佔百分之九十五以上。　　但為什麼受傳染那樣多的人，不一定每個人都發生癆病呢？不明醫理的人都昧於此理，實際這原因就是由於人體有一種「自然療能」能夠抵抗癆菌。即使癆菌一時繁殖起來，侵飾肺部，而菌體周圍，也會長出結締組織來，像鐵絲網樣把牠圍裏着。不讓牠出外蔓延。可是這種事實，必須體質健强方才條件適合。否則當體力衰歇，或是環境不良時，肺癆便一發不可收拾了。凡是將成癆期的青年，營養减退，以及一股人無故發乾咳，或晨起多痰，這都是肺中潛伏着的癆菌趨於總爆發的預兆！但普通人儘多有悍然不顧，以致弄到後来欬血發热，險象不一而足。　　藉醫藥的功效，預防肺癆嫌疑的危機，以及促增治愈的機轉，在近代確然已經達到了成功之路。據德國一位肺病專家Dr.　Perrin　博士和一位美國結核病學教授Lenbarlz　M.D氏實地證實肺癆的有效治療，認為「補肺拿爾」為絕對的特效專藥，兩氏所用「補肺拿爾」治愈的，較他種藥品多過四倍强。的確，我在滬南平民醫院的臨床實騐，便能證明此藥在醫學上的價值。不過對於體力和神經衰弱有失眠等症的肺病人，男子以兼服「補體康」及女子兼服「補女容」來壯健週身，較更美善。這確為肺癆各期症候的對症補救！健美秘訣　　　女子健美之水準線  南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師　　乳房豐腴　臀部高聳　　　女子的乳房豐腴，臀部高聳，並不是完全說這是女子的肉感，否則當偶像似的供異性來追求她。這無異侮辱女性，我們在醫學立場上說起來，這是女子健美的水準線。因為這類女子，他的全體發育是健全的，他的美並不是限於局部，如一般人所注意的單在面孔。和風吹欲倒的那種病態美。　　但我們時常看到身體發育不全，乳房平坦，臀部削弱，貧血的女子，她的神經總是衰弱的。時常感到頭重腰酸白帶等的症狀。而其原因，都不外於卵巢機能的失常，青春腺的早衰。月經超前落後，有時停止數月而復來。與此等女子結婚，當然是沒有幸福可言的。因為月經紊亂，發育不全的婦女。多不能生育。　　Kalmusks是匈牙利的有名婦科專家。他說凡是乳房萎癟，臀部不發育，和月經困難，久婚不育，神經衰弱等的婦女。必須服具有旺盛內分泌機能的製劑。而具此功效的又非『補女容』一藥莫屬了。『補女容』的功效，有催促乳房發育，月經調整和增强受孕力的功效。同時並能充實肌肉，使皮膚細微光膩，妍態動人。成為一個毫無缺點的健美女子。不過若是有白帶病的，一方可用『卡氏陰道片』為坐藥。以清除白帶。所患自然很速而週到的治愈了。更正啓事　　（上期本刊載有九月念六日所接張姓病人來函，其函中所署岳雲學校名稱，一時誤植獄雲，恐淆聽聞，而滋誤會，特此鄭重申明，並為更正。）讀者園地　　下列各藥，均經國內外著名醫科大學畢業醫師指定，購時務須認明各藥名稱，切勿因妄信旁人言而購雜牌廉價劣藥，以免服後增惡病勢，而危及生命。　　白帶連綿　　張潤珍女士：你所患的白帶，一方是由於傳染丈夫淋病，但延久不愈，體力已呈衰弱，所以有失眠頭痛，月經超前落後，小腹脹痛等情，應當購「卡而雪地」依法外用，並同時內服「補女容」培補體力，兼服「克淋儂」方能得到根治。但你的丈夫也該服用「克淋儂」才好。　　胃病貧血　　楊建國君：尊恙尾部脹滿，消化不良，大便秘結，腹內氣體甚多，食少胃呆，作酸打噎，噁心頻起，致身體漸瘦，面色蒼白，如此嚴重病情，宜强胃與補體兼施，內服「强胃精」糾正胃臟機能，以除各病，並服「補體康」旺盛氣血，即可食慾昂進，體力充盈。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言讀張學良將軍談話  汶　　張學良將軍過去為了九一八事件的直接的責任，深為國人所詬病。自從回國之後，不久就帶了大批東北軍到西北去剿匪去了。最近外報對他有許多傳說，如謠傳他被刺等等。昨日申報發現了他對英國女記者發表的一篇談話。內容是極值得我們注意的。　　在這篇談話中，我們知道張將軍開始認識了民眾的力量。他對外報記者一再說：「蓋如日本所提條件為中國所不能容納者，即使政府容忍，而民眾變難接受也。例如二十一條，曾為當時北京政府所接受，而民眾始終並未承認也。可以為證」。「…但個人意見，以為政府必定能遵從民意，蓋政府之基礎，建築於民意上也」。這話出之於今日的九一八事變直接負責者張將軍之口，實含有極重大的意義。九一八以來四年間的事實教訓，應該給張將軍對事情看得更清楚。退讓只有把自己投到滅亡的道路上去，「土不盡，敵不饜」，張將軍當然能漸漸明白這個道理。從國家危難中，他乃開始看出了民眾力量，為國家唯一基礎，這不能不說是張將軍幾年來一個最大的進步。在這一點上，我們應對張將軍致其贊頌之摯意。　　在國防的立場上，張將軍更明白表示了他真誠的意見，他表示：「個人及西北諸將領，絕對服從中央命令，甚願效命於國防第一綫上。」這是更值得我們擁護的意見。現在每一個人民都希望國內任何派別，在對外抗爭的事實行為中團結統一起來，集中一切力量於國防第一綫，對於每一黨派每一個人的過去的錯誤，今日衹要能以對外抗爭來見諸實行，人民都可以原諒他，而盡力為他的後盾。張將軍已能看到這一點，他表示「願效命於國防第一綫　，應該不是騙人的假話。直接負責喪失東北的東北軍，在「打回老家去」這一口號之下，無疑國防第一綫的責任應由東北軍毅然負擔起來！人民一致擁護這偉大的宣誓，人民都願使家鄉田園成為焦土，傾全部力量為效命國第一綫者後盾。人民已決心將最後的一切付之犧牲而擁護任何效命國防第一綫者對侵略者進行決心的抗戰！　　敵人此刻正以更大的威脅使我們走入更悲慘的苦境。在　之時，擁重兵駐於西北的張將軍能有此真誠坦白而切合民意的意見表示，我們認為是民族漸有希望之一點。我們更希望張將軍能進一步以「效命於國防第一綫」的口號見於事實。察綏離甘陝不遠，侵略者近在敵騎如雲的在那邊深入著了。這正是效命國防第一綫的絕好時機，祝望張將軍能以決心的抗爭把過去一身的垢辱完全洗刷個淨盡！貧兒教養院訪問記  方舟　　（本報特寫）貧兒教養院是潮惠會館所附屬的一個慈善機關，它創立於民國九年間，該院歷任的院董院長均為潮惠旅　人士，院中所收容之貧兒，亦十分爛脚一用——珍珠白玉膏　　有特殊效驗　　「珍珠白玉膏」係正威藥房（二馬路大舞台對面）所發明，確有殺菌祛腐，止痛止癢，生肌收口之功，以治爛脚及一切皮膚病，無不立見奇效，尤其神妙者，愈後，不結疤　，皮色如常，而售價奇廉，每盒大洋四角，每打四元，如電話購買可撥九二五二五實現理想通便劑　威靈潤腸丸　　有潤腸導便之特效　無腹痛成習諸流弊　　吾人日進三餐，必須排便一次，使體內之廢料，不稍儲積，血運自然流暢，精神倍加爽健，反之，渣滓積滯腸中，多有釀成毒素，以損害康健者，倘日服（威靈潤腸丸）一二粒，即能達到自然排便之目的，因該丸係由植物中抽取其有效成分，精製而成，故功效準確，而無流弊，每瓶三十粒祇售三角，正威藥房總經售。</p>

<p>之九以上是潮惠同鄉的子弟。　　該院雖然成立到現在還不過十多年的歷史，然而院中的組織與設備却已經過了好幾度的改革了，過去所收容的貧兒，已畢業未畢業者也已不下千名，現在院中則尚有四百四十多名左右，其年齡最高者二十一二歲，最小的十二歲以上。　　現在院中，全年開支總數在五萬元以上，尤以其中膳費一項為最大支出。此項經費的来源，皆仰給於該院基金利息，及一部份房金的收入，據招待我們的王先生說，照目前的情形，院中的經濟收支相抵還可有點多餘。　　從前院中原有一個木工部和一個鐵工部，現在已經停辦；最近的課程完全側重於教育，但也傍及其他習作，範圍却以教養為目的的，所以他們除了一個私立貧兒教養小學外，還附設了一個初級中學部，以期達到一般旅滬潮惠貧寒子弟，具有普通智識而能在社會上謀生。　　他們的入院手續非常嚴格，凡潮惠旅滬貧苦同鄉的子弟欲入院者，必須院董介紹後，還要經過很嚴密的審查，然後再由董事簽字核准，並祗限收男生，女生不收。　　入院後，院生的一切衣食住用完全由院供給。患病時由院醫診視，重症則送同仁醫院，或工部局醫院治療。如院生之家屬欲領回自行醫治者亦可。　　平時院生絕對不許擅自離院或自由出進，惟照例每月有例假一天，准於星期六下午離院，星期一上課時間以前趕到，倘遇喪婚或重大事故可請特別假，但必須本人家屬來院帶領，否則不准。　　冬夏兩季，院中例須放寒暑假，在此時期中，院生便須上補習課，或自修。　　目前院中所聘教職員計有三十多位，其他辦事人員亦有十多位，平時課程及考試都此任何普通學校皆嚴厲，院生中如有不良行為和成績低劣者，處分亦重；然而要是品學優越及服務勤勞之院生，院中除給予獎勵外，俟初中畢業後，院當局還可代他升學到高中學校裏去，或代謀出路。　　據說該院院長，近來感覺到單祗受了初中教育也難在社會上找出路所以他擬在青陽港那邊去辦一個農業教育班，及在該院附設一個職業教育班，以資造就他們一種專門學問和專門技術。　　最後由王先生引導我們到各部份去參觀，從會客室裏走出來，先到隔壁的辦公室裏，那兒正有四位辦事員在埋頭工作；回出來再拐過一個彎，便是該院的大禮堂。樓上，有一個很大的圖書館裏面同時足够容納二百多人去看書，而藏書方面，搜羅也很豐富，凡適合於初中程度者無不齊備。如「萬有文庫」等。　　下樓經過一個小小的園林和一個葡萄架，是醫院，裏面醫藥間，診療室，病房，隔離室等設備均極周詳。惟手術室則有關如　其他如　（庶）務室，儲藏室，浴室，盥洗室，洗滌室，食堂，臥室等，不但整理得非常清潔，並且每室裏都有很嚴格的規則訂明，院生皆須一律遵守。　　全院共有三個露天運動場，一個戶內運動室，小學部的教室却在運動場傍邊，教室樓上全是院生的臥室，此外，在禮堂前面還有一個玻璃的花房，院的周圍植着許多常青喬木的樹林，進門處傍邊也有一塊小小的園地，環境和空氣都很好。　　總之，該院所給予我的印象是相當的良好的，不過他們進院的手續，應該不一定要院董才有介紹的資格，况且限制了貧女的求學機會，也未免不公。死的陰影（續）  里昂　　『郎使到死吧，我也不相信命運是怎樣權威的東西．我有的是身體，我有的是生命，甚麼銅牆鐵壁都得拼一拼，要我向誰屈膝，向誰落眼淚那可辦不到，辦不到!』　　然而他現在終於落淚了，雙手按住臉，淚水打手指縫裏渗出來。　　先是他默默的走進我的屋子，坐到那隻破舊的籐椅上第一句向我說的是：『現在甚麼路都走完了。』朋友拒絕他再在那裏耽擱，呌介紹進燈泡廠，生手不用，當學徒年歲又嫌大了，無限的愁苦蒙住他顏面，癟癟嘴巴說；『祇有你帮帮我的忙了，吃住是真生活哪，那幾個燈泡廠裏的朋友也不算薄倖，呌他們終年辛苦來養活我，自己也過意不下，他們的二房東說我終日閒着，身面行動都靠不住，想不到失業的人便得負起犯罪的嫌疑，……你想，你想我還能不離開上海嗎！』這些話貫穿了我模糊的神經，我不知怎樣安排他。　　『到那裏你就能找到生活呢！』祇這一句，己刺激着池抬起頭來，想說些什麼而沒有出口。不忍望他的臉，我說：無論如何，你總該暸解我的苦處的，我不是跟你一樣的失業，家的重負還緊緊壓住我嗎！沛生，你，你無論如何總該暸解我的處的呵……』　　　　未料這一串希望他諒解的話，却成為利刃刺痛了他的苦心：『是，是，是，我真太對不起朋友，自己再也想不到會過這麼個日子，現在，現在甚麼路都走完了，永遠也休想找到職業，那還不是祇有死……嗬嗬嗬嗬..那還不是祇有死……嗬嗬嗬嗬……』他終於流淚了，也在哭，哭出聲音……　　可是，他是那樣倔强的人呵。　　又是一個死的陰影掠過眼前，我按住我的眼睛。</p>

<p>白楊  耶戈　　襟河記之三　　秋天的陽光，畏怯地照射在廣闊的原野上。那原野，是光曠而荒漠的。從岸邊看去，無垠的遼闊，只是一片枯黃的，高可沒人的野草，成羣的禽類就在這野草叢里趕逐着，沒有農舍，也沒有炊烟的。　　從這荒原上，不時我們也常能找出了幾點異樣的小黑點子，這地看來，它們就像黑毛鴉，三三兩兩地在荒草中移行着。這黑點子很使我們疑惑，照平底推測它一定是些野獸，而我則持着相反的意見。這兒雖是荒曠，經久沒人居住，畢竟還是一個大平原，且××的餘黨至今沒有剿滅，常有整隊的官軍在這兒出沒的。　　我們底船隻順着水流駛行非常疾速，船夫嚴肅而又莊重地，從早上起他一直沒有說過什麼話。他沉默着，讓濃洌的烟圈把他埋沒了。據說一個好的農民和船夫，只要有一根價值三個銅板的菸袋就滿足了，對於他底那根短短的，禿了頭的小菸袋，每回當他嵌到了嘴角去時，他就現出了那麼滿足的神氣。　　在這時，他忽然就興奮了起來，眼睛微微地沒出了赤黃色的光，嘴角浮着笑，一手從他底嘴角拿下小菸袋，一手就指着遠遠的地方說道：　　『客官，你們看到沒有？在那一邊。……』　　我們注意地，隨着他底手指看去。在那邊，沿着岸的是一長列白楊，有次序地排列着，在一棵非常粗大的白楊幹上，我們就看見一具炭黑的怪物，被一條粗麻繩子拴着懸掛在空中，隨着從河岸上揚過來的風，不時就向四周搖愰着。這怪物很短小約二尺多，全力裸赤着僅殘餘着幾片破希條披懸在肩膊下，胸膛已風乾，露着鱗鱗的胸膛骨，下半截已經腐爛，散打在河里了。　　這種粗看起來，好像是一匹死狗，但當我們看見了被麻繩拴着的已成了骷髏狀的頭顱時，禁不住深深地被驚駭攫住了。我底心跳着！就用着一種愁悶的眼神向平看着又望一望船夫，他却像若無其事地咬牢着菸袋，漠然地露着冷淡微笑，點着頭，好像老早就料出了我們會表示了這樣驚駭似的。　　『這怪物在這兒很多』他生氣似地望柔靜的水面上吐了一口涎沫，淡淡的說道。『這不過是幾十具中的一具吧了！』　　『這是什麼東西呢？有這樣多？』平裝着不懂的福氣問。　　『你還沒有看清楚！』船夫諷刺似的呌道『這是活生生的人哩。……』接着他又嚴肅地沉默着了。　　約過了幾分鐘，這怪物隨着我們航行的速率，就遠遠的掉在背後，一般鹽腥味的腐臭味息，還沒有全從我們底敏銳的嗅覺里趕清，這使我們一想起，禁不住要惡心嘔吐了。　　『在這兩岸』船夫好像也感到了難耐的寂寞似的低低說道，你不要看他是一片荒早野，這里面常常就躲藏着整羣饑餓的人們，他們備有很原始的武器，三三兩兩地在草野里遊散着，當有什麼機會到了，他們便大隊大隊的集中起來，乘當地的官軍不備來個開攻，搶刦着他們所需要的東西。……　　『這些日子官軍也防備的嚴，他們就不輕易到外邊去活動，而且常常有給巡邏隊一個兩個的抓去，為着怕多花子彈，便用刺刀戮破了喉嚨，用繩子栓在頸子掛在這河岸底白楊上示衆。剛才我們看見的，便是這類犧牲者中的一個，已經有個把月了。……』　　『那麼在這荒草里遠遠看來一個里點，一個里點的是什麼？』　　『是他們底哨兵，為着怕官軍的巡邏隊，他們現在也放哨兵了。……』沒有說定，他底眼睛又機警地掉到遠遠去，嘴角悄悄說道：『看！那邊不又是一個？……』　　我們底眼睛隨着他底手指看去，離我們不遠，在白楊下，又有一具炭黑的怪物隨着風在搖幌着了。播音特別節目　　梨園宿耆，票界名彥等創辦之戲劇週報，由上海市伶界聯合會協助，延請戲劇家王雪慶為主筆，創刊號今日出版，在創刊期內，定閱全年，祗收三元，半年祗收一元五角，以五百戶為限，額滿截止，社址在上海漢口路二九三號，該社並為擴大宣傳起見，特於今日下午九時零五分起，追座華東電台（一三六〇），播送平劇歌唱特別節目，其程序如下：　　（一）社董王曉箱，陳良玉，朱耿馥，顧問周信芳，王芸芳，暨伶界聯合會代表致祠。　　（二）中國歌劇社全體社員汪曼傑，黃韻，飛霞，白瑤，飛虹等，播唱新穎歌曲。　　（三）戲藝聯歡社，雅歌集，樂天集名票沈元豫，黃修伯，陳景塘，莊繼孟，胡仲齡，霍笑倩，龔兆熊，襲梅芳，戎伯銘，張中原，郭條脩，王準臣，汪其俊等百餘位會串平劇。　　（四）更新舞台厲家班全體童伶厲慧良，厲慧敏，厲慧斌等播唱精采平劇。　　該臺電話九四二八八，歡迎各界點唱。　　夜城社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午四時半至五時一刻　　桃李刦　（曼琳）　　回來吧　（曼妮）　　小鸚歌　（惠元）　　空中音樂　（孫方）　　母親　（夜音）　　新夜來香　（曼妮）　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時三刻至六時半　　公平交易　（沈瑛）　　人間仙子　（沈玲）　　薔薇之蕊　（陳萍）　　和平歌　（雪霞）　　船夫曲　（斐君）　　時勢英雄　（克競）　　粉紅色的夢　（柴瑟）　　漁村之歌　（沈玲）　　父歸　（沈瑛）　　中華平劇社　　中西（一〇四〇）下午十一時一刻起　　武昭關　（洪鍾美君）　　甘露寺　（松鶴居士）　　跑城　（華震亞君）　　三堂會審　（劉人壁君）　　月下追賢　（江一秋君）彈詞　　曹笑英玉蜻蜓　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇『赤壁賦』　　風流學士講黃州。每日江頭盡興遊。壬戌新秋既望日。與二三知己話　　，瀟灑同登赤壁舟。　　月出東山上。　　彿徊望斗牛。扣弦作板歌明月。滿滿頻將太白浮。一曲清歌一酌酒。客和蕭聲音韻幽。客是西川楊道士。吹得音裊裊。和得韻悠悠。恍如嫠婦泣孤舟。堪歎當年曹孟德。賦詩橫塑與優游。下江陵。破荊州。軸轤千里順風流。果然一世之雄也。未識而今安在否。三萬六千容易過。人生何幸寄蜉蝣。然須看破盧名利。話到窮通我亦羞。洗杯酌。希核收。狼藉盃盤不自由。相與枕席在扁舟。　　陳蓮卿祁蓮芳小金錢　　新聲（一三八〇）午夜十二時至三刻　　開篇『西廂記惠明寄書』　　牡丹開放滿園姣。怎麼平空把禍事招。恰逢强徒孫飛虎、層層密密解槍刀。多說，要搶崔氏為押寨。衆嘍啰圍繞喊聲高。合寺僧人多嚇怕。急得他，主婢三人哭浩淘。老夫人束手無良策。惟說道。可憐女兒有刦遭。在兩廊高喊僧徒衆。欲告哀腸淚如潮。說道。不論僧俗將賊退。願以小女</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe visited President Chiang at the Kong residence in the mausoleum at 10 a.m. on the 8th, making his first courtesy call after arriving at his post. He was accompanied by Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department, and Shimizu, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, as interpreters. Ambassador Kawagoe first paid his respects, then briefly discussed his hopes for Sino-Japanese relations. Afterwards, Ambassador Kawagoe and Shimizu left. Regarding the timing of Kawagoe's fourth meeting with Foreign Minister Chang to discuss the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, the 10th is National Day, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is hosting foreign guests. There is no suitable time this week. It is reported that Kawagoe plans to schedule a time with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs next Monday or Tuesday to visit Foreign Minister Chang again and continue discussions. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10 a.m. on October 8th, President Chiang received Ambassador Kawagoe at his official residence. Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Shimizu, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, served as interpreters. After exchanging pleasantries, Ambassador Kawagoe first stated the future of China and Japan and their relationship to the overall situation in East Asia, expressing his views frankly. He also said that due to the deep relationship between China and Japan, they should help each other to seek stability in East Asia and the true welfare of both countries. In the past few years, due to various unfortunate events, suspicions between the two countries have deepened and misunderstandings have increased. Both sides should do their utmost to remove obstacles to enhancing friendship in a passive way and actively seek mutually beneficial cooperation. President Chiang also explained his views on the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, generally stating that from the perspective of the overall situation in Asia, the fundamental adjustment of relations between the two countries is indeed necessary today. What we require is mainly that territorial integrity is not violated and that sovereignty and administrative integrity are respected. Therefore, all issues between China and Japan should be based on the principles of absolute equality and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, and should be calmly negotiated through diplomatic channels in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere, so that the adjustment of relations can have a satisfactory outcome. Regarding the recent unfortunate incidents in various places, President Chiang said that although the implementation of Chinese government police power varies in these incidents, it is regrettable that such unfortunate incidents occur within Chinese territory. Regarding the Chengdu and Xingbei incidents that have been investigated, the Chinese government is prepared to resolve them immediately in accordance with international practice. Regarding other diplomatic issues, President Chiang clearly told Ambassador Kawagoe that Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ambassador Kawagoe should continue to discuss them. Minister Zhang's views are the government's views, he said. Ambassador Kawagoe took his leave at 12 noon. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After meeting with Ambassador Kawagoe, President Chiang expressed his feelings to reporters from the Central News Agency as follows: Today, when I spoke with Ambassador Kawagoe, we discussed the future of China and Japan and the relationship of the overall situation in East Asia, but we did not discuss the concrete issues under negotiation. However, the spirit of the talks between both sides was entirely based on equality. Ambassador Kawagoe's spirit and attitude were truly admirable for their sincerity and frankness. This was completely based on the policy announced by Prime Minister Hirota in the Japanese Parliament last year, that is, to strive for the realization of the adjustment of relations based on the principle of non-threat and non-aggression. Judging from the spirit shown by Ambassador Kawagoe today, all issues between China and Japan can be resolved through normal diplomatic channels, on an equal footing, without resorting to methods other than proper diplomatic channels, sweeping away past disputes and the haze of darkness. Humans are inherently rich in emotions, and only sincerity can appeal to everything. When I went from Nanjing to Sichuan last spring, I expressed my feelings about Japan, believing that if one side can show sincerity, the other side will surely respond with sincerity one day. I firmly believe that my aspirations and expectations will not be difficult to fulfill. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This afternoon at 3:30 p.m., the Japanese Embassy authorities issued the following statement regarding the meeting between Chiang Kai-shek and Kawagoe: Ambassador Kawagoe met with Chiang Kai-shek for two hours starting at 10 a.m. on the 8th. Chiang told Ambassador Kawagoe that he was determined to work hard to enable China and Japan to improve their relations in the future with a spirit of mutual concession and equality through normal diplomatic channels. Ambassador Kawagoe said that for the sake of the overall situation in East Asia, the two countries should cooperate with each other towards a common goal, adjust their relations, and establish peace in East Asia, which Chiang understood. (8th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning at 9 a.m., Ambassador Kawagoe convened a final meeting at the ambassador's official residence with Consul General Suma, Naval Attaché Sato, and Army Attaché Kita, who arrived in Nanjing this morning. At 9:40 a.m., Ambassador Kawagoe took interpreter Shimizu to Kong Xiangxi's villa outside Zhongshan Gate to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. (8th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Kawagoe made the following remarks after meeting with Chairman Chiang: The content of today's talks has been published in the statement. I have the impression that Chiang is trying to get out of the current crisis and has a very enthusiastic attitude towards adjusting the overall relationship between the two countries. The future of negotiations is certainly very difficult, but not hopeless. We are currently negotiating, and I may need to meet with Chiang two or three more times, which is still undetermined. As for concrete issues, I will negotiate with Foreign Minister Zhang, but the date has not yet been decided. In general, people immediately decide whether something is good or bad, but the matter is not that simple. Sino-Japanese relations are very complex, and both sides have reasons, so we can only gradually negotiate to promote a resolution. In short, the impression I have gained is that Chiang's sincerity in opening up Sino-Japanese relations is fairly reliable, so I will thoroughly investigate and strive towards the common goal of China and Japan from both passive and active perspectives to establish peace in the Orient. (8th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Machida Chuji, President of the Minseito Party, left Tokyo for Kansai on the evening of the 7th. Machida said in the train that the Sino-Japanese issue is currently under negotiation by the authorities, and he does not want to express his opinions. However, I sincerely hope that a satisfactory solution can be reached between China and Japan. (8th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The meeting between Chairman Chiang and Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe today is generally regarded as an indication that Sino-Japanese negotiations have resumed. This move has attracted great attention from the Japanese government and the public. However, the Japanese have no definite views on the outcome of this meeting and are generally pessimistic. It is expected that Chairman Chiang will do his best to break the Sino-Japanese deadlock, but will focus on preserving China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Kawagoe will take a tough stance, demanding that Chiang recognize in principle the various conditions Japan has proposed to China. According to the Asahi Shimbun, Kawagoe will decide the success or failure of the future of Sino-Japanese negotiations based on the results of his meeting with Chairman Chiang and adopt a corresponding strategy. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The meeting between the two giants, Chiang Kai-shek and Ambassador Kawagoe, began at 10 a.m. today and lasted for two hours, ending at 12:05 p.m. Chiang saw Kawagoe to the door, and the two stood together for a photo shoot by the press corps, shaking hands tightly before parting. The results of the meeting will be announced at 2:30 p.m. today. (8th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese elder statesman Gokei Fu returned to Tianjin after completing his inspection in Beiping. He said that the Sino-Japanese diplomatic dispute should not be delayed any longer. If it is not resolved for a long time, changes will occur. Recently, rumors have been spreading everywhere, and relations between the two countries have reached a final juncture. Although Kawagoe's visit to Chiang has slightly improved the situation, it is difficult to expect a thorough solution. If this continues for a long time, relations between the two countries will become increasingly tense, and the overall situation is difficult to imagine. World peace may also be affected. He will stay in Tianjin for two days and return to Japan to report to various leaders on what he has learned. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Wang Chonghui Issues Statement in Nanjing: Sino-Japanese Peaceful Relations and World Prosperity; Difficult to Predict Future of Amending League of Nations Covenant <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui said that the Sino-Japanese diplomatic atmosphere is quite serious. He does not know the details of the recent negotiations between the two sides and cannot make observations or criticisms. However, he believes that if the two countries can quickly bring diplomacy back on track with a spirit of peace and good faith, then the dark clouds may be swept away. The international community is paying close attention to the situation in the Far East, and is particularly optimistic about peace between China and Japan, which will not only directly stabilize Asia, but also indirectly consolidate world prosperity. Wise people in all countries share this view. As for the future of Sino-Japanese negotiations, it is impossible to predict what degree of spatial evolution will occur. I am sorry that I cannot answer. Regarding the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant, various countries have submitted proposals to the League of Nations, with most advocating strengthening its power and a few advocating reducing its constraints. Several major countries have not yet expressed their opinions. This matter appears simple on the surface, but is extremely complex in content, because it is closely related to the positions and claims of various countries. This important case cannot take effect without the approval of all members. What the future holds is still unknown at this time, but it is feared that the current conference will not be able to make a concrete decision. The League of Nations will give us a quasi-permanent council seat. Voting will take place on the 8th. Zheng Tianxi will succeed the judge of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and voting will also take place on the 8th. The so-called quasi-permanent council member is slightly different from a permanent council member in legal interpretation. Although they can be jointly elected and re-elected, they cannot take effect without the approval of more than two-thirds of the General Assembly, so it is more difficult to be elected, and it is also very difficult to be re-elected. After the Guangxi issue is resolved, the whole country has achieved unification. I met Li Delin in Guangzhou before, and he expressed great satisfaction with the central government's solution. Bai Jiansheng is preparing to come to Nanjing for a short period to meet with President Chiang and various central authorities. However, all handover matters have not yet been fully completed, so the time has not yet been determined. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai after the Double Ten Festival for a follow-up visit to his nose ailment. If there are no incidents to delay him, he will take a boat from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 21st, and then go to Guangzhou. If something happens at that time, it will be postponed.

<p>The illegal trading case of the Guijutang is an international property trading case. This property was purchased by a foreign merchant in the name of Guijutang in 1913 from a Chinese Mr. Li for a price of over three hundred yuan. At that time, foreign merchants in Shantou were mostly British and German, and the affairs of the Guijutang were also dominated by merchants from these two countries. Therefore, the organization of the Guijutang group and the property rights of the hall site were registered with the British and German consulates successively. The property deed was stored in the British Consulate. Currently, the affairs are managed by the British businessman Robinson, the general manager of Jardine Matheson. This property is located on the left corner of the Municipal Government on Outer Ma Road, currently numbered 163, with an area of 58.7 square zhang and a building on it.</p>
<p>Recently, because the affairs of the Guijutang have not developed and most of the old members have returned to their countries, the entire property right was sold to the Japanese national Wang Zhenqian for a price of 32,000 yuan. The contract was signed and the money was cleared on July 18th of this year. At that time, because the person in charge, the British businessman Robinson, went to Shanghai, the handling of the sale procedures was entrusted to Li Qiming, the Chinese manager of Jardine Matheson. Although the middleman on the contract was listed as Sheng Mingshi, it was actually Li Yongming who was responsible for being the middleman. This international illegal trade did not follow international practice to first ask our government to buy it, and only freely transferred it after our government expressed its unwillingness to accept it. Therefore, the Guijutang's transfer of property rights is actually illegal. Even if our government expresses its unwillingness to accept it, and the property rights are freely transferred, it is still purchased by foreigners. The foreigner should immediately report to the consulate of that country for registration, and then the consulate should, in accordance with international law, transfer the details to the local government for filing and acknowledge that the land is a leased territory. After the term expires, the local government will buy the land rights and recover the property, because foreigners cannot enjoy permanent property rights. Mr. Wang Zhenqian, a Japanese national, did not follow this procedure, so it is also illegal. Moreover, when the Guijutang transferred the property rights to Wang Zhenqian, the old contract was not specified, so when the negotiation first occurred, it was still questionable whether the property rights belonged to the Guijutang. Recently, the British Consul Gardner discovered the old contract from 1913 when the Guijutang purchased the land from the Chinese Mr. Li. If this old contract is illegal, then the property rights still belong to the government and are still illegal. However, now that there is an old contract as evidence, the Guijutang's property rights issue is easily resolved. But even if it is proved that the property rights belong to the Guijutang, it is of course an illegal sale on the part of the Guijutang to transfer it freely without first asking our government to buy it. As for the Japanese national Wang Zhenqian, it is of course an illegal act not to follow the procedures to submit a request to the consul of that country to transfer it to our government for filing, but this is not the crux of the negotiation in this case.</p>
<p>After the Municipal Government discovered this illegal trading case, it arrested Li Qiming, the person in charge, on August 26th, and later Li found a guarantor and pledged to "purchase the property rights back within two weeks." Thus, this international multi-party relationship negotiation began. As a result, the pledge expired on September 7th, and although Li Qiming tried every possible way to redeem the property, he was rejected by the Japanese side and had to surrender himself and find another shop guarantor to extend it for another two weeks. But the second extension expired on September 21st, and it was still not resolved. During this period, the British Consul Gardner formally protested to the Municipal Government on August 27th, first presenting various evidence to prove that the property rights were not illegal; then claiming that the case was being negotiated and that the sudden detention of Li Qiming, the Chinese manager of Jardine Matheson, who was not related to the case, was a loss of international courtesy; and finally saying that the case was already being handled by the British businessman Robinson, requesting that Li Qiming's pledge be cancelled. However, all of these had no results. Later, the British Consul, together with the American Consul, went to the Japanese Consulate to meet the Japanese Consul to inquire whether he knew about the case. The Japanese Consul replied that he had not received a report, and again to no avail. On September 18th, at about 3:00 PM, the bomb case at the Guangzhi Foreign Firm occurred. The British Consul, following the Japanese Consul, went to the Municipal Government again to negotiate, requesting the cancellation of Li Qiming's second pledge so that he could be released and find a way to negotiate the redemption. The Municipal Government only agreed to extend it for a few more days. If it is not redeemed, it will be handled strictly according to the instructions of the Department of Civil Affairs. It is probably difficult to resolve this case, and whether it can be successfully recovered is questionable. Because Wang Zhenqian's purchase of this property was not out of his own will, it is probably on behalf of an "ally" to buy it. Now that the "ally" has completed the arrangement of the Guijutang, the Shantou Japanese Residents Association and the Japanese Club will soon be officially relocated, and the Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau behind the Municipal Government will undoubtedly be monitored. Moreover, the Japanese elementary school is also facing each other across the street, which is even more convenient for many actions. In summary, this illegal trading case is not simply a dispute over sovereignty in legal procedures, but actually a military and political issue.</p>

<h3 id="e48">The Future of China's Pharmaceutical Industry—Thoughts on the Completion of the New Building of the Wuzhou Pharmacy— <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>In today's era of global civilization, the belief in scientific healthcare has been deeply ingrained in everyone's minds. Even those who adhere to established rules know that it is difficult to survive if they are out of touch with the times and that they can only destroy themselves if they go against the tide. Therefore, they are making preparations to learn from others, hoping to correct their mistakes by learning from other sources. How to improve nutrition and the necessity of reforming medical affairs are all steps that those with knowledge believe should be strived for. The advancement of the pharmaceutical industry is certainly a pressing need at present. The large-scale import of foreign raw materials in recent years is enough to reflect the urgent domestic demand. Those who pioneered this difficult path should be the Western medicine merchants who are responsible for introducing and promoting it. Nowadays, there are many pharmacies in cities, which have significantly contributed to changing customs. However, if pharmacies themselves only limit themselves to supplying goods, it is not enough to satisfy our expectations. They must further promote research and strive for self-sufficiency in technology so that gradual progress can be made to gradually reduce dependence on foreign imports. On the one hand, it will cultivate the vitality of the country and society; on the other hand, it will also provide opportunities for technical talents to develop. Then its significance will be doubled, and our expectations will be even greater. The Wuzhou Pharmacy in Shanghai, known to have a history of 30 years, not only focuses on transporting imported goods but also knows to strive for self-reliance in invention, gathering technical personnel to engage in research work. It has successively established three factories. The so-called "Guben" soap has long been popular throughout the country. The newly manufactured glycerin is poised to stand out. Recently, in order to expand its scope, it built a ten-story building, which has recently been completed. Seeing the rise of this new building and admiring its magnificence and comprehensive facilities, we believe that its foundation is stable and that it will be able to develop its future mission. We cannot help but feel hopeful. Indeed, given the scarcity of domestic industrial institutions today, it is not just a personal celebration for a single factory to be able to continuously strive for progress. It will also be a promising sign for the development of the entire pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we cannot help but express our full enthusiasm to encourage its success.</p>
<p>The Wuzhou Pharmacy was founded in the fifth year of the Republic of China. Since Mr. Gui Xiangsongmao took over the management, it has been thriving. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Xiang was rescuing fellow sufferers in the chaos of war and unexpectedly suffered an accident. At that time, in addition to mourning Mr. Xiang's misfortune, we also regretted that this well-established factory had suffered an unexpected blow and said that it would be difficult to restore its former glory in a short period of time after this injury. However, before long, a magnificent building suddenly appeared before our eyes, surpassing its past in both scale and reputation. This is due to the success of Mr. Xiang's business successors and also shows that every adversity should be met with a spirit of struggle. The result of perseverance and hard work will eventually overcome difficulties. This is what we should deeply experience in a turbulent environment. As far as we know, the most noteworthy aspect of the pharmacy's work is the manufacture of raw materials. Few in the country are capable of manufacturing raw materials. For example, glycerin is widely used, but most of the products on the market are imported. The advent of Wuzhou glycerin has given it a chance to gain a foothold. The manufacture of organic compounds is rare in the country. The products manufactured by Wuzhou's second factory include antidiarrheal, organic compounds of iodine, such as red mercury bromide, organic compounds of mercury, used for disinfection or suitable for treating diarrhea, all of which have been sold separately and have achieved remarkable results. With such constant effort, there is no fear that it will not make rapid progress. Because of our fervent expectation for the advancement of industry, we are happy to write about it in detail, even if it is just a small success. We only hope that those in charge will make even greater efforts to continue to promote its advancement. Technical talents should be cherished, and their salaries should be generous and their conveniences provided so that they can concentrate their efforts and cope calmly. Then, the efficiency of their work will be greatly improved. When interacting with other businesses, they should encourage each other to improve their capabilities and raise the status of the pharmaceutical industry in the country. We are not clever, but we will wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e49">US Secretary of the Navy's Declaration: Resolute to Respond to Threats with Threats, Preparing to Participate in Naval Competition, Pacific Fortification Plan Gradually Tightening <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared today that if a naval arms race occurs after the expiration of the Washington Naval Treaty at the end of the year, the United States will never lag behind. He also stated, "Military defenses must be met with military defenses, and threats must be met with threats." Swanson did not explicitly express his opinion on the British proposal to continue Article 19 of the Washington Treaty. However, observers here believe that Swanson's words have proven the importance the United States attaches to this matter, and the United States is also prepared to "do its utmost" in the arms race. According to naval experts, if Japan guarantees to maintain its existing naval strength, the United States will find it difficult to agree with the British proposal. The United States previously agreed to limit naval bases in the Pacific, based on Japan's acceptance of the 5:5:3 naval ratio as a condition to ensure that the naval forces of Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Pacific are only for self-defense. If Japan abandons the treaty, the United States will naturally reconsider the Pacific defense issue to cope with Japan, (October 7, National Telegram).</p>
<p>(Washington) Herbert, the editor of the "Sea Power" magazine and an officer of the Navy League, declared here today that the Navy League is preparing to publish a plan advocating that the United States should open more naval bases in the Pacific. He said, "We will propose to maintain the US naval strength in the Pacific in the most economical way. The United States abandoning the fortification and construction of naval bases on Pacific islands is a misguided act of self-deprecation. The Japanese parliament and newspapers advocate Japan building fortifications and air force bases on mandated islands, which violates the terms of the mandate. The United States can only open naval and air force bases on Guam and Mindanao to counter them. If we retreat further, Japan will take an inch and want a mile, and we will be driven out of the Pacific," (October 7, National Telegram).</p>
<p>(London) The British government, considering that the Washington Naval Treaty will expire and become invalid on December 31 of this year, has proposed that Britain, the United States, and Japan hold negotiations to extend Article 19 of the treaty, which concerns the non-establishment of coastal defenses and naval bases in Pacific territories, to keep it effective. Regarding this matter, the British government began negotiations with Tokyo and Washington several weeks ago. However, so far, no news has been received here regarding Japan's attitude. According to responsible sources, the Japanese government is currently giving careful consideration to this issue. The relevant ministries of the Tokyo cabinet are currently studying the entire Pacific issue, so they cannot give Britain a reply on the issue of Pacific coastal defenses and naval bases for the time being. Political figures here also believe that if Britain, the United States, and Japan can sign an agreement on the fortification of Pacific territories in the future, the scope should be expanded to include air force bases. This seems quite important, because although the Washington Treaty did not have provisions for air force bases, since 1922, the aviation industry in various countries has greatly developed, so Britain firmly insists that provisions on aviation bases must be added, (October 7, Havas Telegram).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is expected here that Japan will advocate revising Article 3, especially regarding Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands, because Japan has an important naval base on Mako Island in the area. Japan is increasingly threatened by Vladivostok and still desires the right to renovate and strengthen the defense projects of the Kuril Islands. Furthermore, due to Guam seemingly becoming an important air force base, the defenses of the Ogasawara Islands and Chichijima Island are also planned to be strengthened. The Asahi Shimbun now anticipates that Britain, the United States, and Japan will reopen negotiations to seek a mutually acceptable basis for maintaining peace in the Pacific, (October 8, Reuters Telegram).</p>

<p>A dispute has arisen in New Zealand's Wellington Samoa region regarding the issue of Chinese laborers. The local committee has telegraphed the New Zealand government, requesting the immediate expulsion of Chinese plantation workers from the Apia area. It is reported that various plantation merchants there are quite surprised by this matter and fear that if the New Zealand government grants the request, all plantation businesses will be completely destroyed, because the local indigenous workers are extremely unsuitable for plantation work and Chinese laborers are indispensable. Therefore, a political party has been organized to oppose the aforementioned proposal to expel Chinese laborers, (October 8, Reuters Telegram).</p>

<p>(Harbin) The Soviet government's suppression of the Trotsky faction is nearly universal throughout the country, and has become even more severe afterward. Large-scale searches continue in various places. According to recent news, the division commander Yerusaev, who was trusted by the Moscow government and awarded the Order of the Red Banner, as well as several leaders of the Far East Red Army Headquarters, have been secretly arrested by the secret police, escorted to Moscow, and there has been no news since. It seems that turmoil has occurred within the Far East Army. According to another piece of news, since the large-scale search, ordinary people, let alone party members, are trembling with fear and feeling precarious. For example, the communist cadres of the Gulemolin headquarters are all haunted by mental panic, and Commissioner Paulid Vinoyou and others are escorted by guards and replace their usual car drivers with powerful figures from the National Security Branch. Other professional trade union organizations have also been searched, and the powerful figures of the local associations of professional trade unions have mostly been arrested. Others arrested include Duyb Ge, the former husband of the Swedish Minister Yago Langpong, Bank Landerf, the former chief of the Caucasus Secret Service, Mansia Kgof, the vice consul stationed in Vienna, Secretary Baodalin, and Uriyanov, a staff member of the Soviet Embassy in Warsaw.

<h3 id="e56">Japanese Minseito and Seiyukai Parties Hold Large Conferences Respectively, Both Presidents Deliver Policy Speeches, Both Advocate Establishing Diplomatic National Policy <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Osaka: The Kansai Conference of the Minseito Party was held at the Osaka Nakanoshima Central Public Hall at 6 PM on the 8th. At that time, President Machida's speech on the current important issues was mainly as follows: What the people expect most from the current cabinet is the implementation of military retrenchment and the renewal of all administrative affairs. The results of military retrenchment can be seen to be progressing gradually, which is satisfying to us. However, we feel even more keenly the need for the early achievement of results in the renewal of all administrative affairs, the eradication of long-standing abuses, and the revitalization and stabilization of the people's minds. Therefore, the current task of the current cabinet regarding the renewal of all administrative affairs is extremely important. The primary meaning of the current national policy lies in the establishment and implementation of diplomatic national policy. Today, dark clouds are gathering everywhere in the world, and it can be said to be the eve of a world war. Japan also takes into account its position in the world and cannot but quickly establish a grand policy for stabilizing East Asia, ensuring the survival rights of the Japanese people through the mutual strengthening of diplomacy and national defense, and striving to realize a situation suitable for the international environment in order to maintain peace in the East. Today, due to the urgent national affairs such as the enrichment of national defense, the advancement of industry, and the stabilization of the people's lives, a huge amount of national expenditure is unavoidable. Therefore, the considerable determination to increase taxes and reform the tax system is truly inevitable. However, how those in power reconcile and handle these three aspects requires painstaking effort. As for the necessity of electricity control, there is no doubt for anyone. When our party previously decided on basic national policy, it clearly advocated the strengthening of control over power generation and transmission, which is also why. As for whether it should be privately owned and nationally operated or state-owned and state-operated, each has its advantages and disadvantages, so it seems that a thorough comparative study is needed. The reform of administrative institutions is a major event in the renewal of all administrative affairs today, and is as urgent as the thorough implementation of constitutional politics and the exercise of parliamentary functions. Now is the time for political parties and other political forces to unite to achieve what is called a united national effort. Our party has long strived to fulfill this full responsibility, (October 8, Domei News Agency Telegram).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Seiyukai Tohoku Conference held in Aomori on the 8th, President Suzuki's speech, delivered by Director-General Hato Yama, was mainly as follows: "In this extraordinary period both at home and abroad, the Hirota Cabinet proclaims the renewal of all administrative affairs and focuses on establishing national policy, which is truly commendable. However, the government lacks a consistent guiding policy, and the ministries are merely competing to propose plans and list outlines, which is meaningless. The center of the current national policy is diplomatic national policy. For example, the recent frequent anti-Japanese atrocities in various parts of China are ultimately due to Japan's failure to fundamentally establish a diplomatic national policy. The government should quickly promote China's self-awareness with an autonomous and consistent policy, bearing in mind the great resolve that the security of the East should be undertaken by the East. Regarding the government's announced tax increase plan, its scale and related aspects are extremely broad, and it is impossible not to study it in detail in order to determine our party's attitude. In recent times, bureaucratic self-righteousness has been repeatedly advocated. After all, this doctrine is a politics of autocracy, despotism, or expediency, which is completely incompatible with the politics of constitutionalism that respects public opinion. Today, the issue of administrative reform is the subject of much uproar. Understanding this fundamental issue is an urgent task for the people, (October 8, Domei Telegram).</p>
<h3 id="e57">Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Berlin, No Changes to Ambassador to Britain <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Political figures have recently confirmed that after Premier Mussolini held talks with German Ambassador to Italy Hassell on the 1st of this week, Foreign Minister Count Ciano has decided to visit Berlin at the end of next week. The purpose of this trip remains shrouded in mystery. It is heard that the mission Ciano is undertaking to Germany will be purely political in nature. As for the devaluation of the Italian lira, it was a free decision by the Italian government. Although the German side is quite dissatisfied, it seems that it will not be raised for discussion again when Ciano visits Germany. In addition, it is predicted that Ciano's talks with key figures in the German government will not go beyond three issues. First, should the propaganda activities of the Austrian National Socialist Party be prohibited? Moreover, the recent division within the Austrian Patriotic Defense League, with a conflict between the league's leader, Prince Stalinburg, and Major Fei, the leader of the league's branch in Vienna. What attitude does Germany take towards this matter? Second, can Germany participate in the Rome Protocols of the Italy-Austria-Hungary tripartite? Third, the Vienna Conference of the Italy-Austria-Hungary tripartite is imminent, and diplomatic preparations should be made beforehand. It is unknown whether Foreign Minister Ciano will make a small stay in the Hungarian capital on his way back from Germany, (October 7, Havas Telegram).</p>
<p>(London) There were previous rumors that the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, would be transferred. According to well-informed sources, Grandi will remain in his original position and will not be transferred, because if the Italian Ambassador to Britain were to be changed, it would cause difficulties in diplomatic protocol. If Italy were to simply send a new ambassador to Britain to present credentials, the credentials would necessarily be signed by the King of Italy under the name "King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia," which would be difficult for Britain to accept. People here believe that if the British government accepts this kind of credentials, it would be tantamount to acknowledging the results obtained by military aggression, (October 7, Havas Telegram).</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese authorities in Taiwan are planning to lodge a protest regarding the action of three British naval officers taking photos within the Keelung fortress area. According to Japanese sources, the 15,000-ton British submarine tender "Medway" anchored in Keelung Port at 3 PM on Tuesday. Japanese police saw three British military officers using cameras to take pictures through telescopes. Japanese officials immediately boarded the ship to investigate. The British side handed over the film, and after development, seven of the photos were taken within the fortress area, (October 8, Reuters Telegram).</p>
<p>Taipei: The Taiwan Military Headquarters issued the following announcement at 11:30 AM on the 8th in the form of an official statement regarding the incident of the British submarine tender photographing the fortress zone: On the 6th, the purser of the British submarine tender "Medway," which arrived in Keelung, took photos of Sheliao Island and other important parts of the fortress on the deck of the ship that day. After developing the film, the photographed locations were very clear. However, this action clearly violated Article 4 of the Military Regulations Protection Law and Article 7 of the Fortress Zone Law, so it should be resolutely dealt with. However, because the situation is serious and cannot be resolved locally, it is a matter that should be transferred to the central government. In short, it is truly regrettable that such an unfortunate incident occurred among British military officers, as it demonstrates a lack of common sense and moral values, (October 8, Domei News Agency Telegram).</p>

<h3 id="e59">Spanish Civil War: Another International Dispute Arises; Soviet Russia Protests to the Neutrality Committee Regarding Germany, Italy and Portugal Aiding the Rebels; Threatens Free Action If Prohibition Is Not Enforced <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to the opinions of diplomatic commentators, Soviet Russia's threat to withdraw from the non-intervention agreement regarding Spain has caused serious concerns in Britain and other countries. The League of Nations is also worried that Soviet Russia may, following this declaration, openly aid the Spanish government. Currently, all parties are dissuading Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov from bringing this issue to a formal meeting of the League of Nations, but all feel it is extremely difficult. According to well-informed sources in Paris, Madrid may be able to hold out for another month. If this is the case, then Soviet Russia will be able to supply the Spanish government forces with a large number of aircraft and armaments during this extended period. The re-emergence of this issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War may result in severe internal tension in France, and French Prime Minister Blum's difficulties will also greatly increase as a result. As for the official circles in Rome, they believe that Soviet Russia's actions are arbitrary and unreasonable, and they deny that armaments and aircraft are still being transported to Spain after the ban was issued. Another section of people in the Italian capital believes that Soviet Russia's actions are stimulated by the rebel's maximum victory in Spain. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Mr. Kahan, the Soviet representative attending the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War in London, delivered a speech at the meeting on the 7th of this month. His words are as follows: "I am instructed by the Soviet government to make the following statement: On September 15th, the Spanish government sent a letter to the governments of Portugal, Germany, and Italy, protesting against the continued supply of war materials to the Spanish rebels by these countries. At the same time, the Spanish government also sent similar official documents to other governments participating in the non-intervention agreement on Spanish internal affairs, and attached a request to take appropriate measures to stop the current situation in which the legitimate Spanish government is, in fact, blockaded, while the rebels are able to freely obtain military aircraft and other weapons from all sides. When the League of Nations General Assembly was in session, Spanish Foreign Minister Vayo also raised the same issue to all member states of the League of Nations. In its published White Paper, as well as in the additional materials it released in Geneva on October 3rd, the Spanish government listed many recent violations of the non-intervention agreement. We only need to point out the following incidents as proof: Twenty-three carloads of wooden crates shipped from Hamburg, containing fourteen disassembled aircraft, arrived in Seville from Portugal on September 7th. Subsequently, the rebels of the so-called 'foreign legion' were transported from Tetouan to Seville by this type of aircraft. On September 29th, the Spanish government received a report stating that a large number of Italian-made poison gas and armaments had been transported from Lisbon to the Spanish border on the 27th. During the examination held by the Public Committee presided over by Ms. Rathbone, a member of the British Parliament, reporters from major newspapers were present, and many eyewitnesses testified that the supply of armaments to the rebels was still being carried out on a large scale, mostly through Portugal. The progress of the examination was reported and published by various reporters. The rebels currently have dozens of bombers and fighter planes from Germany and Italy, while at the beginning of the rebellion, the Spanish army did not have this type of aircraft. Among the rebel aircraft shot down by the government forces, there were nine German-made aircraft with the Henkel trademark. German and Italian aircraft are currently transporting rebel troops from Morocco, via Gibraltar, to Spain. The Portuguese border area has been a base for the rebels since the beginning of the rebellion. The rebels gather troops in Portuguese territory and obtain armaments from that country. Since the establishment of this committee, the Soviet government has repeatedly instructed me to raise the issue of thoroughly investigating Portugal's open violations of the non-intervention agreement and stopping similar activities. The Soviet government is concerned that the situation created by these constant violations of the agreement will render the non-intervention agreement meaningless. The Soviet government will never allow the non-intervention agreement to be turned into a smokescreen to conceal the actions of some participants in the agreement who are assisting the rebels and resisting the legitimate government. In view of this situation, the Soviet government has to declare that if the actions violating the non-intervention agreement are not stopped immediately, the government will consider itself no longer bound by the agreement." (TASS, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow, and the agenda includes three important items: (1) The memorandum submitted by the Soviet Union, requesting that an investigation team be dispatched immediately to the border area between Spain and Portugal to investigate violations of the agreement.</p>
<p>(2) The memorandum submitted by the United Kingdom, requesting that the issue of neutrality be discussed with the Portuguese government, and then an investigation team be dispatched as appropriate. According to the opinions of British political figures, this method may be accepted by Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of foreign aid to Spanish military materials being transshipped at sea. British naval figures believe that if the Soviet Union, as stated in its memorandum, immediately cancels its obligations under the non-intervention agreement if a certain country does not immediately cease its aid to the Spanish rebels, then the country may dispatch warships to Spanish territorial waters, and the international situation caused by the Spanish civil war will inevitably become more difficult. In order to avoid involvement, the United Kingdom may have to recall its own warships, which is not impossible. Furthermore, the Czech Republic has also raised concerns about foreign interference in the Spanish civil war, which will be handled by the Adjustment Committee together. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Edinburgh: The Spanish government representatives, Mr. Azua and Mrs. Valencia, arrived here this afternoon. They immediately attended the Labor Party Congress and presented a report on the violations of the non-intervention agreement by Germany and Italy. The impression of the congress members was very deep after listening to the report, and many representatives advocated demanding that the government revoke the arms embargo. However, the members of the Executive Committee are deeply concerned that the international situation may become more complicated as a result. Therefore, they nominated Major Attlee, the leader of the party group in the Lower House, and Mr. Greenwood, the leader of the Trades Union Congress, to go to London to meet with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain to make a request to him, but did not give them specific instructions. Attlee and Greenwood are scheduled to return here on Friday to report to the Congress and the Executive Committee. Before his departure, Attlee made a statement on the issue of rearmament, stating: "Our party does not want to give the current government the power to act expediently. We are extremely concerned about the protection of national security and the maintenance of world peace, and we are no less concerned than others. However, our party does not necessarily accept all the actions of the current government. Maintaining peace and completing a genuine collective security system are both firmly advocated by our party, and in order to achieve these goals, we are also willing to strengthen our military equipment. However, if all countries blindly follow the trend of expanding their military equipment, security cannot be achieved, peace cannot be expected, and war may even be triggered. Is this desirable?" (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Spanish President Azaña, at the request of Mrs. Vivolis, a special correspondent of the Petit Parisien newspaper, stated yesterday: "If there were no other complications mixed in, the internal unrest in our country would have been quelled by the legitimate government long ago, and it would not have been delayed until now. This decisive matter is not just a domestic dispute, and those affected by it are not limited to the Spanish people. Regarding the foreign interference in our domestic unrest, the rebels have received an endless supply of external aid, while the legitimate government has been blockaded, and even trade with friendly countries is not allowed. Judging from legal principles, how can this be considered fair? From a political point of view, what is involved in our domestic unrest is not only the freedom and independence of our country, but also the balance of power in the Mediterranean, the control of the Strait of Gibraltar, and the naval bases in the Atlantic Ocean. The question of which country should utilize our country's rich resources, such as copper, mercury, aluminum, and caustic potash, should also be decided here. From this, we can see how bad the impact that the blockade can cause is." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The General Affairs Conference of the Socialist Party passed a motion today, declaring that the non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is a betrayal of democracy, so the entire issue must be reconsidered. This intention has been telegraphed to Belgian Prime Minister Janson, British Prime Minister Baldwin, Soviet dictator Stalin, and French Prime Minister Blum. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e60">Spanish Government Forces Recapture Important Town South of Capital; Besieged for Two Months Before Breaking Through; Both Armies Now Engaged in Street Fighting <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Oviedo: Special dispatch from our correspondent. This city is the capital of Asturias Province. Since the outbreak of the civil war, it has fallen into the hands of the rebels. The government forces besieged it for more than two months, and only today did they break through. Street fighting has broken out in the city, and the situation is very intense. The rebels are holding the arsenal and still thinking of resisting stubbornly. The government forces are launching a fierce attack on the factory on the one hand, and besieging the prison on the other. The rebels have to retreat slowly to the central area of the city. It is reported that there are more than 1,000 hostages from the People's Front in the prison. Some time ago, fascists asked the rebel commander, Colonel Aranda, to execute them all by shooting. I don't know if they are still alive. After the government forces entered the city, many rebels surrendered. It is said that since the beginning of the civil war, Colonel Aranda has requisitioned all the food in the city and sold it to the residents, and all the money he has obtained has been pocketed. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Oviedo: Left-wing miners are fully attacking Oviedo. Today is the fourth day. It has been raining heavily all day, and the rebels are retaliating with machine guns, with bullets raining down. However, these miners are still calmly pressing forward. Everyone believes that the outcome of the battle can be seen soon. The rebels are gradually retreating, and today they have set up a second line of defense at the end of the main road in Oviedo. The miners hope to be able to enter the city center today. (National, 7th)</p>
<p>Navalperal: Small battles have repeatedly broken out in the nearby mountains here today. The leader of the government forces said that he is quite confident in holding Navalperal. If the government forces on this road can prevent the rebels from advancing, then the plan to invade the capital will be difficult to succeed for a while. The rebels have fired more than 1,500 shells at this area in the past 24 hours, and the government forces have suffered very few losses. (National, 7th)</p>
<p>Rabat, Morocco: The rebels have sent an ultimatum to the capital, saying that if the government forces do not surrender the city, they will launch a fierce attack from both air and land. Rebel aircraft have also dropped millions of leaflets in the skies over Madrid, causing the residents of the city to be extremely alarmed and have begun to prepare to leave the country. However, the militia currently only allows children, the elderly, women, and those who cannot bear military service to leave the capital, and the rest are all prevented from leaving. Since the rebels have occupied Ritaima, they are getting closer to Navalcarnero, a town 25 miles west of Madrid, which is the center of the highway and railway. It is widely believed that the government forces will make a final resistance in the area. Although Navalcarnero Town is a fortress for the government, with solid trenches, the rebels advanced to less than ten miles from the area yesterday, inflicting heavy losses on the government forces. The government forces seem to have no fighting spirit. General Varela, who previously rescued the Alcázar of Toledo and led a large army to attack Madrid, is now planning to attack the capital from three sides: (1) attacking Navalcarnero, an important railway center; (2) attacking Aranjuez, the main railway junction on the only route from Madrid to the coast; (3) attacking Illescas, 25 miles south of the capital on the highway and railway line from Toledo to Madrid. It is expected that there will not be any major resistance in the latter two places. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>( ) The stock exchange seems to have completely forgotten the economic panic that has swept the world in recent years. Yesterday was the third day of the market boom. The transformation is indeed rare since 1929. Considering the reasons for this, it is indeed due to the adjustment of currency and the speech of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain. Among the various securities, the stock of British American Tobacco Company ranks first, and its common stock price has increased by more than 13 million pounds. The prices of other industrial stocks have also risen. The stocks of chemical, Dunlop, Vickers, Courtaulds, and Unilever factories have risen by 7 million pounds. Oil, gold, shipping, and automobile industries have also benefited from the rise in stock prices. The license fee for stock exchange brokers was only 1,050 pounds a few weeks ago. On Tuesday of last week, it had risen to 1,500 pounds. Yesterday, it was as high as 2,000 pounds. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, it was learned that the profit gained from the devaluation of the franc, 170 billion francs, has been used to allocate 100 billion francs to the balancing fund, 40 billion francs to repay the government's debt to the Bank of France, and the rest to lending banks to reduce debt interest rates. There has been absolutely no funding given to military spending. (National, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Following the weekly report issued by the Bank of France (from September 25th, the day before the devaluation of the franc, to the 2nd of this month), the bank's cash reserves have increased to 7,247,458,462 francs, and the paper money reserve has also increased from 5.42 percent to more than 60 percent.

<h3 id="e64">Southwest Fujian: Starts to Suppress the Remaining Bandits; Divided into Three Regions to Eliminate Within One Month <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After returning to Zhangzhou from Guangdong, Jiang Dingwen, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Fujian, decided to divide western Fujian and southern Fujian into three suppression zones: (1) The Third Division is responsible for suppressing the bandits and communists in western Fujian. (2) The Seventy-fifth Division is responsible for suppressing the bandits and communists in Zhangzhou. (3) The Eightieth Division is responsible for suppressing the bandits in Chaozhou, Quanzhou, and Yongchun. The Pacification Headquarters also assigned bandit suppression inspectors to each zone to urge the troops and local governments to jointly suppress the bandits militarily and politically. On September 3rd, the Pacification Headquarters also issued an order to the county magistrates of western Fujian and southern Fujian, stating: "After investigation, the remnant bandits in Fujian Province have not only failed to be fundamentally suppressed, but have recently become increasingly rampant. The reason for this is that the environment in Fujian Province is special, and the frequent deployment of troops has failed to thoroughly prevent and suppress them. However, the inadequate planning and improper measures of the various suppression units, and the fact that the public organizations in each region have not been sound, cannot be excused. Now that the external insults are becoming increasingly urgent, suppressing bandits and stabilizing the country is imperative. Therefore, the Third Division, Seventy-fifth Division, and Eightieth Division are strictly ordered to fundamentally suppress the bandits in the Yanzhou and Quanzhou areas before November 5th. In addition to ordering the various units to comply with the following matters during the suppression period: 1. Strictly abide by discipline to prevent the gradual harassment of the people. There are many kinds of harassment of the people, which must be strictly prohibited one by one. 2. Strive to love and protect the people in order to consolidate the people's faith. There are many ways to love the people, which must be enlightened at any time. 3. Exhaust intelligence to search and suppress in order to achieve the effect of thorough suppression. There are various ways to search and suppress, which must be properly used according to the time, place, and enemy. 4. Other things, such as how the local government should contact the people, and how military force should be used, must be designed in advance and not ignored. 5. During the implementation of the suppression, in addition to the personnel sent by this headquarters to supervise on the ground, the division commander must still assign capable staff and personnel from the political training office to go to the various suppression areas to conduct on-the-spot inspections to see if there are any cases of obedience in public and disobedience in private, and to comply with the instructions. The county magistrate must know that local officials are fully responsible for local security. At this time of intensive bandit suppression work, how should they cooperate with the troops to find ways to search and suppress, and how should they awaken the people to mobilize together in order to achieve success as soon as possible? If there is any case of obedience in public and disobedience in private, or ineffective handling of affairs, this commissioner will only enforce the law and will never forgive." At the same time, the Third, Seventy-fifth, and Eightieth Divisions were ordered to comply.</p>
<p>At the same time, military actions to suppress bandits in various zones were launched. Regarding the bandits led by Zhang Ashan, who were entrenched in the deep mountains of Chuanchang and Nankang in Nanjing County, Zhang Shutan, the secretary of the Nanjing County government, Zhuang Daheng, the party affairs instructor, and local gentry Lin Jiaren, Jian Jifeng, etc., together with Jiao Tuan of the Seventy-fifth Division, went to Nankang on September 3rd. At that time, it was decided to block all the transportation routes in Chuanchang and Nankang. On one hand, teams were sent to search and suppress, and an appeasement team was formed, with Lin Jiaren appointed as the captain. The Baojia was organized, and a committee for clearing up rebellious properties was established to liquidate the bandits' properties to carry out local construction. Luo Shoutun and Liang Zhongkun, the bandit suppression inspectors sent by the Pacification Headquarters, also went to Nankang to provide guidance and have entered the mountains to search for days. As for the Communist bandits in Zhian, Wu Jin's unit of the pseudo-Fujian-Guangdong border area political committee had more than 300 people, with 180 rifles, more than 100 Mauser pistols, 6 pistols and machine guns, and 2 automatic rifles. Recently, they have been desperately struggling to resist the government forces' painful suppression. They are now investigating household registrations and implementing land distribution in the second and third districts of Yi'an, organizing the pseudo-Red Guards. The pseudo-Soviet regime has also established six elementary schools in Hunan Township. Except for Dongjiao Township, where no one has joined the bandit party, the rest have been banditized. Northwest Yi'an has been ravaged by the Communist bandits, while pirates are rampant along the southeast coast. More than 100 pirates led by Yang Yantong from Guangdong are hiding in the Xizhang Port of the fourth district, robbing merchant ships and kidnapping merchants. After being pursued and suppressed by the Eightieth Division, they have now fled to the Lin Cuodian area under the jurisdiction of the first district and have 12 pirate ships. In September, the Fucheng electric boat sailing between Yi'an and Shantou was robbed, resulting in a loss of more than 1,000 yuan. Furthermore, it is reported that the Qingxiang Committee of the county was established on the 5th, with all sectors of Zhangzhou participating, and the Longxi County government and the 223rd Brigade of the 75th Division were elected as standing committee members.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Correspondence. The Daishan fishermen and salt workers, due to opposing the change of fish and salt, and the accumulation of salt, incited by Zheng Xikun, the manager of the Salt Industry Credit Cooperative, and Monk Xinliang, the abbot of Zifu Temple, staged a large-scale riot involving arson, killing, injury, and robbery, which attracted much attention in society. Subsequently, the Hangzhou police, while suppressing smuggling, unintentionally seized five fishing boats and found many guns and bullets. More than twenty suspects were arrested and interrogated, and then escorted to the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Tax Police Bureau for handling. According to reports, Zheng Xikun and Xinliang were the masterminds, so they consulted with the Dinghai County government to assist in the arrest. Except for Zheng Xikun, who had disappeared since the incident, Monk Xinliang was arrested and also escorted to the Liangzhe Tax Police Bureau for handling. The Liangzhe Salt Transport Envoy's Office successively transferred all the witnesses to the court for investigation. All these matters have been reported in the newspapers. Now, it is learned that after a detailed investigation by the prosecutor of the Hangzhou County Local Court, except for Lin Zhengtang, Lin Zhangting, Wang Apu, and Fang Shize, who were passengers and had nothing to do with the case, they were not prosecuted. The other defendants, Zheng Xikun, Monk Xinliang, Lin Shoulai, Lin Afeng, Wu Rongguang, Lin Shaoye, Lin Bao Kun, Lin Lifang, Lin Genrui, Zhang Shanlin, Lin Yuexiang, Lin Yangsheng, Lin Amao, Fan Agen, Ye Xingxiang, Shen Shanxing, Ye Xinglong, Shen Shanbao, Shen Xianghao, Song Rudi, Shen Ayun, Lin Changde, Feng Jinlong, and Lin Abiao, a total of twenty-three people, were prosecuted for crimes of disrupting order, arson, murder, injury, and robbery. Now, a copy of the indictment of the court has been obtained and is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Criminal Facts: Daishan, which belongs to Dinghai County, is an island that produces fish and salt. Every fishing season, fishermen from other places gather there to salt fish. The tax on fish and salt is thirty cents per load, while the tax on edible salt is seven yuan and ten cents. Therefore, fishermen and salt workers often use edible salt to pay taxes on fish and salt, selling it elsewhere to seek profit. The weighing and releasing bureau there was ordered to rectify the salt tax, implement the change of fish and salt in April of this year, and prepare to build salt warehouses to accumulate salt in order to prevent malpractices. However, the fishermen and salt workers, due to their own interests, collectively opposed it. Thereupon, Zheng Xikun, the manager of the Salt Worker Credit Cooperative, and Monk Xinliang, the abbot of Zifu Temple, seized the opportunity to incite the fishermen and salt workers to convene a meeting at Zifu Temple on July 10 to conspire a riot. They continued to hold a meeting at Dongyue Temple on the 13th of the same month, instigating the fishermen and salt workers to use arson, murder, and robbery as means of resistance, which led to an unprecedented upheaval. At that time, Liu Fengxin, a surveyor from the weighing and releasing bureau, was returning from work when the fishermen and salt workers captured him, hanged him, and beat him severely. His wife, upon learning this, rushed to the weighing and releasing bureau for help. Captain Hu Bugui of the tax police team was dispatched with ten police officers, along with seven police officers from the Public Security Bureau, to rescue him. They encountered the crowd on the way. Captain Hu and squad leader Xu Li stepped forward to mediate, but the crowd immediately snatched Xu Li's wooden-cased gun and shot and wounded him. The tax police fired back, seizing the original gun. Unexpectedly, the fishermen and salt workers gathered in increasing numbers, carrying guns and swarming in, numbering five or six thousand. The tax police fled back to the team headquarters, but the crowd followed and surrounded the tax police team and the weighing and releasing bureau, using rattan shields for protection, firing wildly, and using kerosene to set fires on all sides, causing all the houses of the bureau and team to be burned to the ground. The tax police escaped to Dinghai by boat through the back door. Yang Shangdong, Qian Zhenyao, and Ren Shizhong, officials of the weighing and releasing bureau in the city, were beaten to death while escaping, and the clothes in the bureau were also robbed. At the same time, the Nianmu'ao tax police detachment was also surrounded, and five people, including police chief Xu Yansheng, police officers Zhu Kuiren, Zong Zhaochang, Hu Renyi, and Huang Jin, were all beaten to death and their bodies thrown into the sea. Miao Guang, the director of the weighing and releasing bureau, and the official Dun Hongling, initially took refuge in the home of the local gentry Tang Yueqing. Later, because the violent people surrounded Tang's residence, they disguised themselves and fled. When they arrived at Shi Bi Xia, Shen Ayun exposed them and gathered a crowd to beat them to death with iron shovels and throw their bodies into the sea. The defendants Lin Afeng (also known as Lin Afeng), Lin Shaoye, Wu Rongguang (also known as Wu Yunguang), Fan Agen, Zhang Shanlin, Lin Abiao, Lin Lifang, Ye Xingxiang, Ye Xinglong, Lin Changde, Lin Bao Kun, Lin Yangsheng, Lin Amao, Lin Genrui, Lin Yuexiang, Shen Shanbao, Shen Xianghao, Song Rudi, and Feng Jinlong, who were present at the scene and committed the crime, fled in their boats the next morning. Near the West Pagoda of Huangsha Port, five fishing boats were intercepted by the tax police team, and twenty-four suspects were arrested. Two Mauser rifles and stolen clothes, flannel robes, pearl tents, and other items were found in Lin Afeng's boat. All were handed over to the Tax Police Bureau and sent to the Liangzhe Salt Transport Envoy's Office, which sent a letter to the court. The Zhejiang Higher Court Prosecutor's Office ordered this office to investigate, and approved the Liangzhe Salt Transport Envoy's Office and the Dinghai Local Court to send Monk Xinliang, Shen A'er, and Lin Shoulai to be investigated together. The investigation has concluded and prosecution should be initiated according to law.</p>
<p>Criminal Evidence: This case is explained in three parts. (1) Regarding Zheng Xikun and Monk Xinliang's conspiracy to riot, and instigating arson, murder, injury, and robbery, Zheng Xikun is the manager of the Daishan Salt Field Salt Worker Credit Cooperative, and Monk Xinliang is the abbot of Zifu Temple. Because the cooperative is located in the temple, Zheng Xikun and Monk Xinliang are very close. When the cooperative's salt workers colluded with fishermen to hold a meeting at Zifu Temple on July 10 to oppose the accumulation of salt and the change of fish and salt, Zheng Xikun was the chairman, and Monk Xinliang participated in the deliberation, which is not disputed by Monk Xinliang. There is also an official letter from the Liangzhe Salt Transport Envoy's Office to support the evidence. It is very clear that the fishermen and salt workers carried guns and rioted, committing murder, arson, injury, and robbery, instigated by Zheng Xikun and Monk Xinliang. (2) Regarding Lin Afeng and others, who carried out the riot, arson, murder, injury, and robbery, the fishermen and salt workers killed a total of nine tax police and weighing and releasing bureau officials during the riot. Except for the bodies that were thrown into the sea and could not be examined, the bodies of Yang Shangdong, Xu Yansheng, and Zhu Kuiren, as well as the burned houses, have been inspected by the Dinghai Local Court Prosecutor, confirming that they were beaten, strangled, and stumbled to death before their death, and filled out the inspection reports separately, and verified the burned situation and drew detailed diagrams in the files. When interrogated, Lin Afeng confessed that the two guns in the boat were for self-defense, and that there were six bullets, which had been thrown into the sea. He also said, "I saw the boat in front firing, and we also fired. There were more than eighty boats traveling together. Some of them were involved in attacking the weighing and releasing bureau." Wu Rongguang confessed that he picked up a gun and a package when attacking the weighing and releasing bureau. Lin Shaoye said, "I went to see what was happening when attacking the weighing and releasing bureau, and my arm was injured by a gunshot." This is tantamount to Lin Afeng, Wu Rongguang, and Lin Shaoye admitting that they jointly carried out the criminal act on the spot. Why would the self-defense bullets be thrown into the sea? Where did the clothes package come from? How was the arm injured by a gunshot? Moreover, Lin Shaoye and Wu Rongguang were both crew members of Lin Afeng's boat. Mauser rifles and clothes and other stolen goods were found in his boat, which is conclusive evidence. According to Fan Agen, a crew member of Lin Afeng's boat, "The package of clothes was robbed by Wu Rongguang, and the gun was borrowed from a Fujian salt household boat." This further proves that Lin Afeng, Wu Rongguang, Lin Shaoye, and others are jointly guilty of robbery, arson, and murder. Moreover, Lin Shoulai confessed, "That day, I went to worship Buddha at Du Chong Temple and went to see the place where the weighing and releasing bureau was fighting. I was shot in the left arm by a bullet from behind." However, after examination, it was confirmed that his gunshot wound came from the front, not from being shot as a bystander, but from being caused by the riot on the spot, which is also obvious. Although Lin Baokun, Lin Lifang, Lin Genrui, Zhang Xilin, Lin Yuexiang, Lin Yangsheng, Lin Amao, Fan Agen, Ye Xingxiang, Shen Shanxing, Ye Xinglong, Shen Shanbao, Shen Xianghao, Song Rudi, Lin Changde, Feng Jinyun, and Lin Abiao did not confess to having jointly carried out criminal acts on the spot, they fled in groups to Huanghe Port West Pagoda after the incident and were intercepted by the tax police. If they had not participated in the riot, why would they have fled together? The suspicion of crime is significant.</p>
<p>Shen Ayun's Case: Shen Ayun is a carpenter by trade and not a fisherman or salt worker. Moreover, he married into the Hu family, which is far from the location of the weighing and releasing bureau. It is difficult to say that he participated in the fishermen and salt workers' riot on the spot. However, Shen Ayun's residence is only a short distance from Shi Bi Xia, where Miao Guang, the director of the weighing and releasing bureau, was killed. It has been verified by the local Public Security Bureau that Director Miao was indeed killed with an iron shovel by a carpenter. Moreover, Shen Ayun confessed, "That morning, I took an iron shovel to the mountain to plant sweet potatoes, and after the incident, I fled to Fengshudun to hide. I returned home after the situation calmed down." His act of killing Director Miao can hardly be said to be unreal. In summary, the defendants Zheng Xikun and Monk Xinliang are guilty of the crimes specified in Article 28, Article 29, Paragraph 1, Article 150 (second part), Article 173, Paragraph 1, Article 271, Paragraph 1, Article 277, Paragraph 1, and Article 326, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. The defendants Lin Afeng, Lin Shaoye, Wu Rongguang, Lin Shoulai, Lin Baokun, Lin Lifang, Lin Genrui, Zhang Shanlin, Lin Yuexiang, Lin Yangsheng, Lin Amao, Fan Agen, Ye Xingxiang, Shen Shanyou, Ye Xinglong, Shen Shanbao, Shen Xianghao, Song Rudi, Lin Changde, Feng Jinyun, and Lin Abiao are guilty of the crimes specified in Article 28, Article 150 (first part), Article 173, Paragraph 1, Article 271, Paragraph 1, Article 277, Paragraph 1, and Article 326, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. It is requested that the above defendants be punished in accordance with Articles 55 and 56 of the same law, as they committed multiple crimes with one act and are continuous offenders. The defendant Shen Ayun is guilty of the crime specified in Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law. This case should be prosecuted in accordance with Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law and sent for public trial, etc.</p>

<p>Cheng Shaoyuan, a peddler from Yancheng, 45 years old, living in a straw shed at Yangye Temple in Guyang Town, Songjiang, was suddenly attacked by four robbers speaking with a Pudong accent at about 1:00 last night. Cheng Shaoyuan's home was bare, with nothing to steal. Only fifteen yuan in cash hidden in his waistband was robbed and the robbers escaped. The money was earned from raising chickens. During the robbery, the robbers asked where the chickens were, indicating that the robbers were familiar with the situation. This morning, Cheng Shaoyuan was drinking tea in a small teahouse at the New West Gate when he saw four people passing by who looked familiar. He immediately followed them to New Street, where he happened to see police chief Sun Xinian and detective Shen Zaihua passing by. Cheng immediately reported the incident. As they were about to question the suspects, they suddenly took off running. The police chief and others chased and caught three of them, while one escaped. They were taken to the Second Precinct. According to their confessions, they are Wang Agen from Nantong, 26 years old; Qin Yaoming from Jiao Diao Bay, Songjiang, 33 years old; and Zhang Honglin from Shihudang, Songjiang, 30 years old. They all denied the robbery. Since the case involves a robbery identified by the victim, the precinct will prepare a document and send it to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>In the urban and suburban areas of this county, within the jurisdiction of the First District, there were originally six public security sub-bureaus. Since Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau took office, he has actively planned to reform the police district system and personally inspected the jurisdictions of the six sub-bureaus. He believes that there are disadvantages of uneven prosperity and barrenness in the population, economy, commerce, and society within the areas under the jurisdiction of the sub-bureaus. The location of the Fourth Sub-bureau is biased towards a corner of the west city wall, but its jurisdiction extends to Huilu. For the convenience of Director Zhang, it is proposed to merge the six sub-bureaus into four: the First and Second Sub-bureaus will be merged into one, the Third Sub-bureau will be changed to the Second Sub-bureau, the Fourth and Fifth Sub-bureaus will be merged into one, and the Sixth Sub-bureau will be changed to the Fourth Sub-bureau. The locations of the above sub-bureaus will be relocated to appropriate locations, and police stations and patrol stations will be added to distribute forces around to maintain public security.</p>

<p>Si County in northern Anhui borders Hongze Lake and has always been a haven for bandits. Xu, nicknamed "Xu Bent Leg," the bandit chief of Dongxiang, is extremely fierce and leads his followers Sun Sisi, Wei Yousan, Pan Yadong, Zang Airu, Zhang Guiyuan, and Wang Baoqin to harm the local area, and the people who have been trampled on are countless. Bandit Xu was recently arrested in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province. Mr. Xu Teng, a local gentry in Si County, sent a telegram to the Siyang County Government to request legal action.

<p>— Li Shengwu</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the point of reciprocity discussed in Minister Zheng's official document, Bayard refuted it most strongly. Bayard said: The treaties concluded between China and the United States in 1844, 1858, 1868, and 1880 do not explicitly stipulate that the subsequent conclusion abolishes the previous ones. By reviewing the contents of the above treaties, it can be observed that the principle of reciprocity is impossible to exist because the administrative structures and exercise of power of the two countries are fundamentally different. Until 1867, the right of Chinese people to reside in the United States was not explicitly stipulated. This can be attributed to the liberalism, democratic government, and generous legislation of the United States, which have not restricted the entry of any foreigners. But what about the situation in China? Anyone can answer that it is completely different from the United States. The Chinese border is like a high wall, and foreigners cannot cross it freely. Until 1884, American citizens began to enjoy special privileges under the treaty - that is, a certain type of American citizens can travel to China for business under various restrictions. Within the scope of various restrictions, American expatriates cannot freely choose locations, build residences, churches, hospitals, cemeteries, or even open stores for business. Even under these circumstances, Article 14 of the 1884 Sino-American treaty still stipulates that the Chinese government is not responsible for compensating for damages suffered by American expatriates under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>(4) Bayard restated the traditional policy of the American government not being responsible for the harm suffered by foreigners and pointed out that the 1850 riot case "attacking the Spanish consul and expatriates" was completely different from the Rock Springs incident. Even for the 1850 incident, the US president did not admit that the United States was responsible, but in order to maintain US-Spanish friendship and consider the rights of the consul, he voluntarily provided compensation.</p>
<p>(5) The Chinese minister has mentioned the American government's efforts to protect foreign nationals and suppress riots. However, the special nature of the Chinese expatriates and the difference in their habits often complicate the American government's exercise of protective power. These special habits prevent them from approaching American citizens and other residents and often place them in an isolated position. Therefore, they are extremely easy to provoke racial concepts, especially when they compete with expatriates from other countries for the rough jobs that the American people are unwilling to undertake. Moreover, Chinese expatriates maintain their isolationism and choose to live in remote areas. The administrative authority in these places is very weak, the racial concepts are more profound, and labor conflicts often occur, which makes the government authorities feel troubled at all times.</p>
<p>Finally, Bayard said that regarding the Rock Springs case, he personally believed that he could persuade the President to submit it to Congress for consideration so that the innocent Chinese expatriates who were harmed could receive relief and to atone for the regret that the local government failed to prevent it in advance and to provide relief after the fact. However, the result of this arrangement should not be regarded as the American government fulfilling its legal obligations, nor should it be regarded as a precedent for future reference.</p>
<p>Bayard's above official document and President Cleveland's official document to Congress were delivered to Congress at the same time. On February 24, 1887, Congress passed the compensation case. For the Chinese expatriates who were harmed in Rock Springs, the American government paid the Chinese government 147,748 yuan and 74 cents as compensation, which was distributed by the Chinese government to the deceased Chinese expatriates and their relatives. This case came to an end.</p>
<p>Comparing this case with the resolution of the New Orleans case, the circumstances of the former case were more serious and the circumstances of the latter case were lighter; the Italian expatriates in the New Orleans case incited mob violence, while the Chinese expatriates in the Rock Springs case were all innocent and good people; the resolution of the New Orleans case was swift, while the resolution of the Rock Springs case was slow; the diplomatic debate in the New Orleans case was simple, and the debate in the Rock Springs case was heavy; the above are the differences. The final resolution of both cases was that the American government assumed compensation, but both denied that the United States had legal responsibility, and neither accepted the demand for punishing the perpetrators. This is the similarity. At that time, China's national power was weaker than it is today, and the Chinese minister Zheng Zhaoru's negotiation on this case can be said to be quite successful. Considering the negotiation process of foreign expatriates suffering infringements in our country, one cannot help but feel the difference between heaven and earth. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 8th) Capital Police Chief Wang Gu Pan visited the Boy Scout campsite on the morning of the 8th to inspect the security guard service situation, and gave instructions to the security team, ordering them to pay attention to Boy Scout safety. He also scheduled to host all the Boy Scouts from Tianjin to Beijing on the 9th for a celebratory gathering.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Campsite News <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>To facilitate the transmission of news, the Preparatory Committee has established a radio station at the campsite, inviting Ms. Wang Yulin and Ms. Sun Meilian from Nanjing Women's Middle School to serve as broadcasters. The broadcasts are conducted in pure Mandarin Chinese, and the two ladies' clear articulation is quite commendable. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Security Section and Fire Brigade held a fire prevention and air defense practice performance at the racetrack, which was highly praised by the audience. The campsite hospital has been working continuously for several days, with 17 general outpatient visits, 49 surgical visits, 1 dermatology visit, and 4 ophthalmology visits. One person was transferred to the Central Hospital due to serious illness. The Sanitary Affairs Office also sends ambulances to the field for service every day. In addition, the male and female bathrooms sponsored by the section were opened on the 7th. The male bathroom has both hot and cold water pipes, while the female bathroom uses all hot water, accommodating 5,000 people for bathing each day. The campsite area is vast, making comprehensive care difficult. To facilitate the treatment of acute illnesses, four emergency stations have been set up for emergency needs. The campsite has more than 70 temporary stores, mainly divided into bookstores, snack shops, tea shops, cafeterias, restaurants, tea houses, laundry services, photography studios, Boy Scout sports goods stores, barber shops, grocery stores, pastry shops, and rice, salt, oil, and soy sauce shops, with food being the most prevalent. The area is far from cities and towns. Those who have their own cars can travel more conveniently. Other personnel, to avoid long and arduous journeys, often stay in the area. Therefore, the food stores are particularly prosperous at lunchtime.</p>
<p>The Second National Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree is held here during a time when autumn rain does not fall and the climate is mild, coinciding with a serious diplomatic period. It precisely corresponds to what Huainanzi called "autumn practices spring orders, the country has great fear." We, in order to temper our physique and revitalize the nation, cannot take this unprecedented event lightly. We specially drove out of Zhongshan Gate, passed through Zhongshan Mausoleum, and headed far to the Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree Committee Office. The office is a temporary shed, simple and unadorned, serving as the workplace for various sections and groups. It displays various silver-made awards and many flags of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, and various officials. In front of the office, Yang Bingyi, an official of the Boy Scout General Association, painted a watercolor oil painting of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek riding a horse, his expression heroic and profound, leading people to see this great leader of hard work and high merit, leading the masses, and enhancing the concept of national revival. It is said that if others were to create this painting, it would take a year and a half, but Mr. Yang completed it in just twenty days, which can be said to be the epitome of painting skills. On the campsite, there are Boy Scouts from various places, such as 48 from the East Asia Sports Academy, 21 from Nanjing Modern Middle School, 40 from the Private Deaf-Mute School, 40 from the Orphans' School, 15 from Jiangning County, 43 from Zhongshan Sports Academy, 18 from the Shanghai Louvre White Wolf Team, 70 from Beijing City, 26 from the Jiangsu Boy Scout Council, 5 from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, 35 from Suzhou Cheng Lie Sports Academy, 29 from Zhenjiang Middle School, 30 from Liangjiang Women's Sports School, 22 from Anhui Chuzhou Middle School, and 47 from Henan, serving in separate routes, with posts standing like forests, and the order is well maintained. The environment of the mausoleum has always had beautiful scenery, coupled with the campsites from various places, each camp gate has exquisite and outstanding works vying for beauty and innovation, embellishing the area, bringing an artistic touch to the heroic and orderly atmosphere. The campsite has a campsite newspaper office, which is used by the Propaganda Section to publish materials and host reporters from various newspapers. The campsite post and telegraph office is used for ordinary postal and telegraphic communication at the campsite. However, for the speed of sending telegraphs by reporters, it is necessary to enter the city to send them directly, because the area is far from the city, and if the transfer takes place, it will be limited by the time of the vehicles, which is somewhat slower. The campsite has a broadcasting tower for broadcasting and observation, and in addition to delineating the areas for each participating unit, there are four reserve areas between Qingjie Road, Qinlian Road, and Zhuren, Renai, and Lijie roads. In addition, there is also a campsite bank, covering several feet, to the right of the Qingdao-Guangdong area, which is the East Commercial District, and to the left of the campsite hospital's fourth emergency station, which is the West Commercial District. Wherever you go, you may encounter Boy Scouts practicing courses, or arranging campsites, or engaging in various rehearsals and practices. Due to time constraints, once you pass by, you cannot describe the special circumstances of each place in detail, and when you enter the city, it is already a scene of thousands of lights.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hopes for Boy Scout Labor Service <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shufang</p>
<p>(1) New Life Movement and Boy Scouts</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek initiated the New Life Movement, it has been enthusiastically implemented throughout the country. Besides the military police, the Boy Scouts are responsible for its promotion in various localities. Taking the capital as an example, Boy Scouts account for more than half of the over 11,000 members of the labor service corps. The situation in other places is roughly the same. This shows the military importance of Boy Scouts in promoting the New Life Movement. We study the reasons why Boy Scouts have become an important cadre of the New Life Movement, and there are two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The organization, training, and discipline of the Boy Scouts have many similarities with the labor service corps, and the standards that the Boy Scouts need to meet are completely the same as the "neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, active labor, speed, and certainty" six principles stipulated by the New Life Movement Association. Therefore, the actions of the Boy Scouts can easily integrate with the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>(2) The New Life Movement pays the most attention to improving customs and habits, and the easiest time to start improving customs and habits is in childhood. The New Life Movement Association uses Boy Scouts as cadres to promote the New Life Movement, on the one hand, it can make the Boy Scouts themselves more sound in all their actions and become role models in society, on the other hand, because the organization of Boy Scouts is extremely universal, this can make the power of the New Life Movement universal throughout society, especially important, today's Boy Scouts will be the central members of future society, and the impact on the progress of future society is extremely significant. Therefore, the New Life Movement Associations in various places use Boy Scouts as cadres for promotion.</p>
<p>(2) This Service Work Plan</p>
<p>This time, the Boy Scout General Association took advantage of the opportunity of the National Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree to stipulate the holding of large-scale labor services in the capital, which has two meanings:</p>
<p>(1) To introduce the service spirit of Boy Scouts from various provinces and cities to the people of the capital.</p>
<p>(2) To assist the New Life Movement in the capital with the strength of the entire Boy Scout force.</p>
<p>The scope of this service is very broad. In the city, there are Guofu Road, Zhongshan Road, Zhongshan East Road, Taiping Road, Zhuque Road, Jiankang Road, Baixia Road, Liji Lane, Ke Lane, Hongwu Road, etc. Outside the city, there are Muxuyuan, Housanzhuang, Zhongzhuang, Qiansanzhuang, Barracks, Xiaolingwei, Zhongling Street, Wukesong, Maqun, etc. Although the service area is very wide, the service objectives are very concentrated. In the city, attention is paid to the two items of rules and cleanliness, and outside the city, attention is paid to sanitation campaigns. The personnel participating in the service are 1,038 male Boy Scouts in the city and 552 female Girl Scouts outside the city. This large-scale dispatch is unprecedented in the capital.</p>
<p>(3) Hopes for Participating Service Personnel</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this service will give the people of the capital a major sensation, and at the same time, the New Life Movement in the capital will make rapid progress. Before you start working, I would like to express a few hopes:</p>
<p>(1) Clean the city appearance In the service area, the facade of shops and households, from walls, counters, and signboards, should be carefully checked one by one. If there is any damage or dirt, they should be advised to repair or wash them. The sidewalk in front of the gate should be advised to be swept and sprinkled at any time to maintain cleanliness.</p>
<p>(2) Improve traffic In the service area in the city, except for the traffic on the major roads, which is still directed by traffic police, the other alleys, such as Ke Lane, Liji Lane, and Hongwu Road, etc., have a large number of vehicles coming and going on weekdays, and vehicle congestion and traffic jams often occur. Coordinate with the military police to organize them to improve traffic in these areas.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to hygiene The work in the service area outside the city is a hygiene campaign, and special attention should be paid to the cleanliness of the kitchen and the cleanliness of the drinking water source. Regarding the first point, the method of cleaning the kitchen should be told to the housewives of each family. Regarding the latter point, the village chief should be told to pay attention to the protection of the drinking water source.</p>
<p>(4) Implement edification During the service time, the attitude should be peaceful, the explanation should be detailed, and the other party should be edified with a sincere spirit so that they naturally accept the persuasion and are willing to implement it.</p>
<p>(5) Set an example During the service time, the attitude and actions of the service personnel are most likely to attract the attention of the citizens. Therefore, each service person should be neatly dressed and full of spirit, so as to set an example for the citizens. In particular, the cleanliness of the facade, kitchen, and sweeping of the sidewalk should be taken as an example, personally advocated, so that the citizens can imitate and promote the effect.</p>
<p>I would like to mention a few points as above based on my temporary thoughts and contribute them to the Boy Scouts who participate in the service.</p>
<p>Convention Emblem</p>
<p>(Explanation)</p>
<p>1. The arrow represents upward, the ring represents unity, and the bow represents effort.</p>
<p>2. Three rings and twelve arrows represent the Chinese Boy Scout Oath and Rules.</p>
<p>3. Binding the arrows with a ring means that unity is strength, and it is difficult to break many arrows. The arrow is on the string, which means readiness.</p>
<p>4. The entire emblem means that Chinese Boy Scouts abide by the oath and rules, unite as one, work hard, and prepare to revive the nation.</p>

<p>— Ji Wu</p>
<p>The term "labor service" is translated by some as "voluntary labor," which is copied from the German Reichs Arbeits dient. They use the country's youth to directly participate in the country's social construction projects. The initial regulations of the National Socialist Party were still of a voluntary work nature, but after 1935, they were changed to compulsory work. All young men and women between the ages of 17 and 25 must serve for half a year. The types of work are nothing more than reclamation, road construction, afforestation, gardening, improving transportation, preventive engineering, and building barracks. This type of work starts from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., and classes or sports are held from 2:30 p.m. In the evening, there are gatherings such as entertainment, singing, music, and film screenings. When I was in Germany the year before, I visited many such youth barracks and was deeply impressed by their youth training facilities that militarized and politicized the national defense.</p>
<p>After the Soviet revolution, when they wanted to industrialize the country, they also used the Pioneers youth movement to directly participate in the national industrialization movement. They trained these young Pioneers to wear scientific tools and carry the spirit of exploration to investigate all the products and raw materials in Russia's villages and forests. In a few years, they also achieved earth-shattering results.</p>
<p>China has a large population and vast territory. It is well known that everything, including culture, transportation, agriculture, industry, and commerce, is backward. Everything is not as good as Germany and Russia. However, the general youth in China lack leadership and guidance, and they are still living in a drunken dream, ignoring the needs of the country. The general educators are still holding on to the methods of traditional education, busy handling some untimely and impractical education. Talking about this is really heartbreaking.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the national crisis period, the Ministry of Education collected opinions from all parties in December of this year and reached more than 100 items. After convening a meeting and discussing, it has formulated a special education program. The basic goals of this program are:</p>
<p>1. Focus on physical training</p>
<p>2. Improve spiritual training</p>
<p>3. In terms of knowledge and skills, focus on production capacity and special education.</p>
<p>Among the detailed items of this program, there is an item on "Regulations on Youth Labor Service Measures." It is reported that the current regulations have been stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>In addition to carrying out major labor services in shifts on a rotating basis, students in secondary schools and above should also use part of their holidays, Sundays, winter vacations, summer vacations, and other holidays to engage in the following work:</p>
<p>(1) Participate in local public welfare undertakings and various construction works, such as tree planting, disaster prevention, disaster relief, engineering, agronomy, household registration investigation, literacy campaigns, public health campaigns, and New Life Movement, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Participate in military rear service internships, such as air defense, anti-virus, security, mass organization, grain management, transportation management, and installation and use of telephone and telegraph machines, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Participate in labor within the school, such as cleaning school buildings, tidying up the campus, repairing sports fields, and repairing equipment, etc.</p>
<p>The labor service held during the National Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree this year is aimed at Boy Scouts guiding rules and cleanliness, and Girl Scouts guiding rural hygiene. The intention is extremely good. Because the Chinese people generally regard general rules and cleanliness as unimportant, and they believe that rural hygiene is not important, the entire society is full of mess, dirt, suffering, gloom, and lack of emerging atmosphere. In general, the level of education is too naive, and the reason why it is difficult to change is also due to the lack of guidance. We certainly know that it is impossible to use 1,000 Boy Scouts and 500 Girl Scouts to guide the people of the whole country on rules, cleanliness, and rural hygiene. However, the promotion of this movement can enable Boy Scouts across the country to find a new service path, and with the strength of the existing 500,000 Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the effectiveness they play among the general public is really extraordinary. If the number of 500,000 Boy Scouts is not enough, then I think that the central government can make overall plans to establish close links between the central government and the local government, integrate political national defense with youth training, and organize the Central Youth Labor Committee to govern everything, dividing the country into several regions. In each region, the local government and schools jointly establish a labor service department to promote local construction work. In this way, the promotion of labor service may be more meaningful and effective.</p>

<p>Board of Directors</p>
<p>Our company was founded in 1907 AD, which is the 33rd year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was not organized as a corporation. The formal establishment of the company was in the second year of the Republic of China. The business gradually became prosperous, and the capital also increased year by year, from 100,000 taels to 500,000 taels, then to 1 million taels, and then to 1.5 million yuan. With the expansion of the business, branches spread at home and abroad. This was probably beyond the initial expectations. Its achievement is due to the support and guidance of our government and people from all walks of life. How could it have been possible without them? Now that the new building is completed, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of its founding, recalling the past and encouraging the future, we dare to express our thoughts, hoping that the gentlemen who love our company will continue to favor us.</p>
<p>The 30-year history of our company has things that we will never forget. First, the leaders in the founding period were able to find the right people. Mr. Xia Cuifang had great talent and foresight, and started the company. Mr. Xiang Songmao succeeded him, with his heart and energy focused on vigorous management. These two gentlemen, their talents, their aspirations, and their courage, were all far superior to others. Gathering two outstanding individuals in one place, shining one after another, cooperating with a sincere heart, led to success and prosperity. The firm foundation of our company has its origins.</p>
<p>Second, the business policy over the years has been purely progressive and self-reliant. We never imitate the old ways. We overcome any difficulties with deep wisdom and courage. We strive from ourselves to develop our strengths, and never seek a life of dependence. If there is even a little surplus strength, we will fully develop it according to a steady approach, in order to seek the flourishing and prosperity of our career. We never miss opportunities. For example, we initially sold imported materials. Once the preparations reached a considerable level, we immediately engaged in self-manufacturing. In addition to making medicines, we also engaged in making soap, and extended to all chemical products. The Taihe Pharmacy, the Gubens Soap Factory, the Yalin Odorous Water Factory, the Zhonghua Xingji Soap Factory, the Nanyang Cork Factory, and others, were successively transferred to us. We welcomed and accepted them with a sincere attitude and solid strength. We established a foothold in reality and looked far ahead. All the precedents left by our predecessors, we should respectfully inherit and always remember to help each other.</p>
<p>What makes us even more grieved and pained, and dare not but dip our brushes in tears to advertise to the world and future generations, is that the late General Manager Mr. Xiang Songmao ventured to rescue the staff of the Second Branch during the January 28th Incident, and died as a result. If Mr. Songmao had even a little bit of love for his own life and indifference to the lives of his colleagues, then Mr. could have lived. Even after being captured, if he had disregarded his national identity and the dignity of the country, he could have also lived. Mr. died trying to save my colleagues in our company, and fighting for the personality of the Republic of China. If our company survives for even one day, we will always commemorate Mr. If my colleagues have even a little bit of conscience, we should always be moved by Mr.</p>
<p>My colleagues look back on the martyrs, cherish their legacy. Deeply afraid that we cannot shoulder the heavy burden, we remember that the country is in distress. The entire world economy has fallen into a slump. Although the local industry and commerce continue to have vitality, the times are tight and it is difficult to take on big tasks. I feel ashamed and terrified. Therefore, I offer these two points with sincerity, and seek advice:</p>
<p>Our country's hygiene theory was imported from overseas, and its business was also initiated by foreigners. Now the government is diligently seeking better governance and has set up a special department. The whole country is following the trend and promoting it without delay. To do a good job, we must first sharpen our tools. Our company has gained importance in society. Regarding hygiene drugs, new developments are emerging every day and year. We should take the responsibility of cooperating with the supply, so as not to be lacking. This is what our company should encourage itself to do.</p>
<p>Our country's Western medicines have always been imported. Although there are many native medicinal materials, they have not been thoroughly studied. Recently, some people have studied medicines with scientific methods, such as the Institute of Materia Medica jointly run by the Peiping Research Institute and the Shanghai Sino-French University, the Department of Pharmacology of the Shanghai Lester Medical Research Institute, the Department of Medicinal Chemistry of the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences, and the Department of Pharmacology of the Peiping Union Medical College. Some focus on the physiology of drugs, and some focus on the chemistry of drugs, all of which make precise contributions to drugs. The natural product that has been abundant for thousands of years is now showing great effect. Research and invention are the responsibility of scholars. As for manufacturing and promotion, it concerns enterprises. How can the industrial and commercial circles not rise up and take responsibility? This is what our company should encourage itself to do.</p>
<p>All of these are the new missions that our company will accept openly in the future. What my colleagues dare to announce to society is that our company's business policy is based on science as the general basis and the happiness of the people as the general destination. As science advances day by day and human affairs become more and more complex, the demand and supply of material things are also becoming more and more complex. My colleagues wish to use their best efforts. We can only call out to the elders, brothers, and friends, and ask them to add one more definition to encourage ourselves:</p>
<p>As the saying goes: Where there is profit, people will flock to it. Only by welcoming it with fairness, will it be accepted more deeply. Only by treating it with equality, will it be maintained for a long time. Based on this belief, my colleagues in our company will never dare to be negligent in their tasks, so as to shame the shareholders. I deeply consider the great righteousness of serving the people, and do not want to seek unlimited profits. Carrying the legacy of the founding fathers, I would like to take fairness and sincerity as the criteria for handling all internal and external business of the company. In the past 30 years, we have relied on everyone's efforts to establish this initial foundation, giving my colleagues a strong basis today. My colleagues dare not fail to work hard day and night with extreme excitement and trepidation, in order to continue to gain a foothold in the ever-evolving world trend, so as to serve the country and society. I only hope that the people of the country will teach us further.</p>
<p>Our Company's Past and Future</p>
<p>General Manager Xiang Shengwu</p>
<p>Our company was founded in 1907 AD, which is five years before the founding of the Republic of China. It was not until one year before the founding of the Republic of China that the previous General Manager took charge. After taking office, he believed that ordinary commercial firms were not enough to promote domestic goods, inventions and manufacturing, so in the second year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into a limited company. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, it acquired the Gubens Soap Factory established by Jinde people. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, it bought the land at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road. In the four or five years after that, it successively acquired several other factories. By the 18th year of the Republic of China, the total amount of shares was increased to 1.5 million yuan. During the January 28th Incident, the previous General Manager ventured to rescue colleagues in the North Sichuan Road branch and unfortunately died as a result. After the difficulty of the previous General Manager, the board of directors publicly recommended Shengwu to take over his duties. At the same time, Mr. Gao Hanqing and Mr. Lu Zhixue were appointed as managing directors to continue the unfinished business of the previous General Manager and actively carry out the established plan. Therefore, a second factory was set up on Anhe Temple Road to manufacture glycerol, and a third factory was set up on Hengye Road to manufacture raw materials, increasing the production of solid wood soap from 1,000 boxes to 3,000 boxes per day. The old houses on Fuzhou Road were demolished and a new ten-story building was rebuilt. In addition, Guangzhou branch and Shanghai Jing'an Temple branch were added. Now, there are a total of 20 branches in this city and other places. There are about 90 special license points. It is almost all over the country and the Nanyang Islands.</p>
<p>The above is a brief overview of the 30-year history of our company. However, the current situation in East Asia is clouded, and there is a sense of impending doom. At this critical moment of survival, we must be calm and determined, maintain pace, listen to the overall national policy, and carry forward our consistent spirit to make further efforts, so as to reduce losses and enrich the national economy, and fulfill our responsibilities. Therefore, despite my meager abilities, I recently advocated:</p>
<p>1. Strive to manufacture medicines and soaps that have already achieved results, increase their production, improve their quality, and expand their sales, to meet the needs of our country and nation.</p>
<p>2. Promote Chinese medicine, hoping to cooperate with scholars, use scientific methods to refine the inherent Chinese medicinal materials that have been around for thousands of years, extract their essence, and make them into new medicines suitable for modern medicine to replace imported products, in order to save the tide of imports.</p>
<p>3. Actively achieve self-sufficiency in various medicines. It is necessary at normal times, but even more important in times of emergency. Therefore, we recently plan to manufacture sanitary products and other medicines that are widely used and most needed as soon as possible, in an attempt to achieve self-sufficiency. This will be advocated by our industry and consolidate the foundation of national self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>4. Practice using domestic raw materials. In recent years, the raw materials used by our company's factories, all those that our country has and are suitable for manufacturing, have almost all been adopted as domestic products. However, in view of the current situation and fear of future misfortunes, based on the principle of self-sufficiency, we will absolutely adopt domestic raw materials in the future. However, we deeply hope that the agricultural, mining, and manufacturing industries will make vigorous progress, produce enough products to meet our needs.</p>
<p>5. Reduce prices. Western medicines come from overseas, and the prices are extremely high. People in our country are often limited by their financial resources and cannot afford to buy them. Our company strives to manufacture while paying attention to new inventions. At the same time, it adheres to the principle of fairness and does not focus on profiteering. It is determined to reduce the price of its products and make them popular and affordable for the public.</p>
<p>In summary, our company's future business methods will be based on science and the happiness of the people as the destination. Tomorrow is the day for our company to hold the 30th anniversary celebration and the completion ceremony of the new building. I am not forgetting my own limitations, and I have outlined the main points. I deeply believe that our wishes are great but our strength is weak. I hope that people from all walks of life will give us assistance and guidance at any time. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Words of Advice</p>
<p>Huang Wupei</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, powerful enemies were rampant, and Shanghai was devastated. Among the major enterprises that were destroyed horizontally, there was the Commercial Press. The houses were burned to ashes, and the machines were melted. The losses were almost incalculable. Among the major entrepreneurs who were brutally murdered, there was Mr. Xiang Songmao, the General Manager of Wuzhou Pharmacy. He sacrificed himself for the sake of his career, and his remains have not yet returned. It is not only the sorrow of one family, but also the strange sorrow of the world. In the past four or five years, the leaders of the Commercial Press have revived and gradually restored their former appearance. There is no need to say more. Wuzhou Pharmacy was succeeded by Mr. Songmao's son, Shengwu, and all the directors worked hard. Therefore, it became stronger and more effective day by day. Now, the completion of the new ten-story building has been heard. The progress is beyond measure. I feel particularly saddened that my deceased friend Mr. Songmao did not see this.</p>
<p>I think the organization of a company is like a country. Although the scope is different, the efforts are the same. Therefore, at the beginning of the foundation, we must first consolidate its foundation and dredge its source, so as to use the surplus power of the beginning to plan for the great plan of a hundred years. As it gradually progresses, the mechanism should be more active and the management should be more meticulous. The foundation should not be lost, and the benefits must be for the public. Then, the arms and fingers will be connected, and the voices and breaths will be unimpeded. We can advance to seek the stability of the career, and retreat to overcome the difficulties of the environment. When Mr. Songmao suddenly suffered misfortune, the whole city was shocked, and the people of the country fled in terror. It is not difficult to imagine the situation of the company at that time. However, in a short period of time, the deployment was set, and the order was clear. Although the commander of the three armies was taken away, the will of the people was like a city. It is because sincerity can be trusted in peacetime, and liver and gallbladder are poured out in adversity. Therefore, it was able to remain unscathed and stand firm. In recent years, the commercial market has been declining, and the company offices have been destroyed one after another. Those who are good at dancing in long sleeves are also engaged in tightening and retreating in fear. Wuzhou Pharmacy has suffered drastic changes in personnel and has been surrounded by an unfavorable atmosphere. It can only manage its heart, bear the current situation, and develop it. It is because its foundation is different from Hengliu, and its splendor reaches its peak. It is not just a matter of luck. People of the country? Entrepreneurs? When you look at Wuzhou, you should know where to reflect on yourself.</p>
<p>However, I still have a word for the gentlemen of Wuzhou. The establishment of a company is to increase production and spread profits as a direct purpose. But from another point of view, benefiting the people and increasing the strength of the country is also the ambition that a big enterprise should have. In recent years, health services in various places have been budding. Therefore, the import of Western medicines is extremely large. In addition, people in our country have a distorted mentality and are happy to use foreign goods. Therefore, the cosmetics that come with Western medicines are also very impressive. Therefore, on the one hand, we must vigorously transform and strive to imitate, so as to compete with imported products. On the other hand, we should also study the inherent medicinal materials, extract their essence, and expand their efficacy, so as to be a substitute for Western medicines. This is what we should strive for. Although the government is promoting new doctors and new medicines, the system of public medicine has not been implemented, and the social relief is not prepared. Poor patients cannot afford new doctors or new medicines. I do not care about medicine, but if I lose medicine, how should I reduce costs so that the fees are not too high? How should we facilitate the common people so that the benefits can reach the masses? This is what we should strive for. The country is in difficulty, and foreign insults are becoming more urgent. Even if we try to seek perfection, people may not be able to restrain their ambitions. The disaster is coming, and it is imminent. Medicinal materials are necessary at normal times, and even more urgently needed in wartime. Therefore, without affecting business, we should prepare the various medicines that are most needed and widely used in advance to be prepared for contingencies. This is what we should strive for. In summary, some of these are the common responsibilities of the pharmaceutical industry, and some should be prevented by the government. Although the meaning is inevitably too high, the need is very urgent. Wuzhou has suffered pain and holds the bull's ear of the pharmaceutical industry. The responsibility of being difficult should be borne more than others. Now that the new building is completed and the 30th anniversary is celebrated, Wuzhou has a special publication, and I am asked for a word. I will complete this for it.</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo</p>
<p>I have seen the rise and fall of industry and commerce countless times in my life. However, there is a reason for its decline, and there must be a reason for its prosperity. It is not accidental. Thirty years ago, I passed Qipan Street in Fuzhou Road and saw several old-style urban houses at the corner, with the name Wuzhou Pharmacy. I learned that the General Manager was Mr. Xiang Songmao from Ningbo County. At first, I thought it was just an ordinary store, and I didn't think it was strange. But soon, it was established as a limited company. The Gubens Soap Factory established by the German, the Zhonghua Xingji Soap Factory established by our country, the Yalin Odorous Water Factory, the Nanyang Cork Factory, the Ningbo Dongwu Town Gongji Cotton Factory, the Taihe Pharmacy in this city, and the adjacent houses of its company were all owned by it. Branches spread across the country, and business reached overseas, and it became a great scale. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Songmao was killed while rescuing his colleagues. The board of directors appointed his eldest son, Shengwu, to succeed him, and appointed Mr. Gao Hanqing and Mr. Lu Zhixue as managing directors to continue Mr. Songmao's unfinished business, increase production, add factories and stores, and rebuild the company's original site into a large building. What kind of magic is it that can achieve this? Those who are self-reliant are strong, and those who rely on others are weak. Those who are pragmatic are solid, and those who step on tigers are in danger. Wuzhou Company focuses on its own inventions and manufacturing, and does not focus on selling other people's goods, so it can be self-reliant and not subject to manipulation. Its products are all based on scientific methods, and it is not willing to be sloppy, so it can be pragmatic and make its reputation outstanding. Therefore, its prosperity has its own way. How can it be accidental? Now that the new building is completed and the 30th anniversary is celebrated, I wish Wuzhou Company a prosperous future, just like the new building that continues to grow taller and taller, from the 30th anniversary to hundreds of millions of anniversaries, each with the most prosperous commemoration. I will write a few words to praise it.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei</p>
<p>Since the opening of the sea, foreign countries have used machines to produce goods with lighter costs and more production, invading our country and competing with our inherent handicraft products. It is right that we fail. The owner of Wuzhou Pharmacy has learned from this and imitated the new method of making medicines and bodies. After thirty years of hard work, the excellence of its products has been welcomed throughout the country. If we continue to progress from this, then its contribution to promoting domestic goods and restoring interests will be even more immeasurable. I respectfully wish for the achievements of the past and wish for the development of the future at the time of the completion of the new building.</p>
<p>Wang Boqi</p>
<p>Since the spread of Western medicine to the East, the Japanese have been working hard on it, studying it diligently, and always willing to devote their lives to it. Their government has also added encouragement to it. They aim to improve medical theory and invent new drugs, so as to follow in the footsteps of Europe and the United States and take the lead in East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese medical and pharmaceutical circles have been racing at a high speed for decades, and they are showing a tendency to catch up. Looking back at our country, there are those who stick to the old ways, and there are those who are indifferent and do not care. The amount of medicinal materials and sanitary products imported from overseas is shockingly large every year. Although this is different from clothing and luxury goods, the impact is direct and accelerates the decline of the national economy, and indirectly can also cultivate the laziness of the people. It is not a trivial matter. Mr. Xia Cuifang had unique insights and established Wuzhou Pharmacy in Shanghai five years before the founding of the Republic of China. In a flash, thirty years have passed. It has expanded from an ordinary commercial firm to a limited company with a large scale and repeated inventions. Branches have been sent all over the country. Now, a towering building stands at the corner of Henan Road and Fuzhou Road. In the course of its hard work, Mr. Xiang Songmao, the former manager, devoted the most effort. Unfortunately, during the January 28th Incident, Mr. Songmao sacrificed himself for the sake of rescuing the branch store. Now, Mr. Zhe Kai Shengwu has succeeded him, and is working with Mr. Yan Fuqing, the chairman, and Mr. Gao Hanxiang and Mr. Lu Zhixue, the managing directors, to complete Mr. Songmao's legacy. The company's future is bright. We can look forward to it. Now, the 30th anniversary celebration is being held, and it is also a celebration of the completion of the new building. It is a rare event in Shanghai. Boqi is not smart, and I respectfully wish those who are in charge to continue to work hard, expand their steps, so as to expand their achievements. Let the cause of Liangxiang sweep away the backwardness of the nation. It is not just competing in the commercial war.</p>
<p>Ma Yinliang</p>
<p>The great inventor Edison said, "The success of any business is 1% due to genius and 90% due to blood and sweat." Now, based on the progress of Wuzhou Pharmacy in the past twenty years, it has progressed from an ordinary commercial firm to a large company organization, and to today's Xiawu Quyu, it is even more believed that it is the price of labor and sweat. This statement is not false. Let's look back at the efforts and management of the former General Manager Xiang Songmao, the construction of Meng Jin, the holding of plans and the outline, and the diligence and perseverance of the employees. Only then can we deeply plant its foundation and devote ourselves to manufacturing. Those who are far and great, such as soap and glycerol, are well-known to the population. Judging from its value, it is not only an ordinary industry, but also opens up the beginning of chemical manufacturing in the country, and also establishes a model for state-run pharmaceutical industry. At this time, the new building is completed, and the heirs are prosperous. They are good at making use of the talents of freight and propaganda to declare the authority of science. I must believe that the blood and sweat of countless successors can further develop this cause and expand it.</p>
<p>Gao Linglin</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy has excellent products, which were created and operated by my late friend Xiang Songmao. It specializes in manufacturing domestic products to resist foreign goods and recover interests. For more than 20 years, he has worked hard to paint walls and hired doctors and pharmacists to make new medicines. He also makes soap, glycerol, and other products to compete with imported products. Branches are all over China and foreign countries, and sales are growing day by day. Songmao suffered an untimely death, and those who succeeded him worked together to carry forward the legacy and plan more grandly. The foundation has been laid, and the hope is endless. Now that the new building is completed and the 30th anniversary of its opening is celebrated, I will write a few words to encourage the people in charge and to congratulate the future of Chinese national goods.</p>
<p>Pang Zhou</p>
<p>I met Mr. Xiang Songmao twenty years ago. I saw Mr. Xiang and his son Shengwu operating Wuzhou Pharmacy in the past twenty years. Now, I have seen the development of his cause at the beginning of my return to China. I have twelve points of nostalgia for Mr. Xiang and twelve points of admiration for the perseverance of his father and son. I have twelve points of joy for the success of Wuzhou Pharmacy, and especially one hundred and twenty points of hope for the future of Wuzhou Pharmacy. If Wuzhou Pharmacy continues to move forward, then Mr. Xiang can be said to be immortal.</p>
<p>Zhao Feiyong</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry seeks to increase the benefits of people by giving full play to the effectiveness of science. It is not just an ordinary business. The world is progressing day by day, and science is also making inventions. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry is also advancing with it. However, since the opening of our country to the sea, although it has been gradually influenced by science, it is still difficult to catch up with the construction and manufacturing of advanced and knowledgeable people. Mr. Xiang Songmao had already organized a pharmaceutical business 30 years ago. It must be said that he was the first to open up the atmosphere. Later, the business grew day by day, and the manufacturing became more and more refined. The products were better than imported products, and the reputation spread all over the world. The gentlemen also developed and expanded it. As of today, the tall buildings and gorgeous mansions are a magnificent foundation. Thinking back to the difficulties of creation, and Meng Jin's pursuit of the halls, and with the heart of Gu, Tan Qunlun's misfortune, he is even more convinced that it will become more and more prosperous and can be passed on to the infinite.</p>
<p>Gu Yuyuan</p>
<p>In today's national crisis and the extreme decline of the social economy, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Wuzhou Pharmacy and its affiliated factories, a pioneer of the chemical industry, is of great significance. When we mention Wuzhou, we will think back to Mr. Xiang Songmao, the manager of Wuzhou, who died in the January 28th Incident in Shanghai in the 21st year of the Republic of China. Mr. Xiang's death will always leave a deep mark on the history of national disasters in China. Mr. Xiang Shengwu, who succeeded his father's business, has been able to develop and expand the Wuzhou business in these short five years. At a time when the national crisis has not abated, it has added color to the Chinese chemical industry. Not only can Mr. Songmao smile underground, but the entire Chinese industrial circle will be happy and celebrate.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy and its affiliated factories have made obvious contributions to improving people's health and benefiting society in the past. Other industrial and national defense contributions, especially the completed glycerol factory and the planned grease factory, are not well understood by the general public and are more worthy of our celebration.</p>
<p>The ancients said that at thirty, one stands firm. It means that the foundation has been consolidated and can develop endlessly. I respectfully wish Wuzhou Pharmacy and its affiliated factories this intention.</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy has been in business for 30 years. At the beginning of its establishment, it was determined to invent and manufacture, and it was not just able to engage in the business of Western medicine. It is even more commendable that it is committed to the research of Chinese medicines. I have often discussed it. Chinese medicines were invented very early and are numerous. According to the Shennong Materia Medica, there are 365 kinds. Later, the famous doctor Tao Hongjing's Records of Famous Doctors, the Tang Dynasty's Xinxiu Materia Medica, the Song Dynasty's Kaibao Materia Medica, Jiayou Materia Medica, and Zheng Lei Materia Medica, and Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica in the Ming Dynasty were repeatedly added and compiled, reaching 1,892 kinds. Although each of them has its own therapeutic effect, only three or four hundred kinds are commonly used by modern people. Among these three or four hundred kinds, some are effective and some are not. In addition, they are attributed to the theory of the five elements and qi transformation. Therefore, Chinese medicines are despised by the modern medical community. It is as if these nearly two thousand kinds of medicines are all materials in myths and are not worthy of a scientist's attention. This is really an unscientific attitude. Indeed, in recent years, the value of ephedra and angelica in medical treatment has been recognized by the medical community as a result of chemical experiments. After all, whether a certain Chinese medicine has value or not, what its nature and effect are, can only be determined after scientific inspection. Emotional support and intentional erasure are both inappropriate. Therefore, the scientific study of Chinese medicine is an urgent task. Recently, I heard that the central research institutions have also paid attention to this. This is really a good phenomenon. Wuzhou Pharmacy, as an industrial and commercial organization, is able to devote itself to this, which is even more commendable. Therefore, on the occasion of its 30th anniversary, I will say this especially, to praise its intention and to wish it continued growth.</p>

<p>Lawyer Bao Gang Accused of Seduction - Details of the Case Incoherent - He is a Skilled Lawyer in Literary Matters, a Strongman in Martial Arts - Yang Yuehua's Testimony - Bao Gang Claims It is a False Accusation</p>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang was accused by Cui Changgui of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Special Task Force, who drives a car, of seducing his fiancée Yang Yuehua, first raping then hiding her, and instigating a divorce. After investigation by the Shanghai Local Court, except for the part of the case against the investigation team leader Zhang Datong which was dismissed, the public prosecution was initiated against Bao Gang and his servant Zhang Jinhua. Yesterday, Judge Xie Zhengnong held a court session. Yang Yuehua stated that she used to be a neighbor of Bao Gang in Jiezhufang, Penglai Road. Because she had a quarrel with her husband, she was taken to Dafang Inn by his servant Zhang Jinhua, where she was first raped by Bao Gang. Bao Gang told her to rest assured, saying that he was a skilled lawyer in literary matters and a strongman in martial arts. Later, he said that Cui Changgui was pursuing her urgently and sent her to Xinlu, Nanhui, and other places. Bao Gang claimed that Yang Yuehua came to hire him to handle the lawsuit and that there was a power of attorney to prove it. He stated that this was a false accusation, which she concocted after he counter-sued the investigation team to evade criminal responsibility. Zhang Jinhua also completely denied taking Yang Yuehua to the inn. The judge stated that the details of the case were incoherent and that further investigation was needed before a decision could be made.</p>
<p>Four Banks in the Fishery Syndicate Pre-allocate 120,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Fish Demand is Very High - Loans Will Begin Soon</p>
<p>In order to relieve the fishery industry and support production, the Ministry of Industry established the Shanghai Fish Market and then contacted the Shanghai banking sector to form a fishery syndicate. At that time, the members included 12 banks, including the Four Banks Savings Society, Xinhua, and Zhonghui. The organizational outline had already been approved by the Executive Yuan, stipulating that the capital would be one million yuan, with 200,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry and 800,000 yuan underwritten by the banks. Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhixin, and Qian Yanfang were appointed by the Ministry to be responsible for the preparation. However, because Wang Zhixin went to Siam for investigation, the matter was temporarily suspended. However, due to the high demand from fish firms and fishermen, the Fish Market Council allocated several tens of thousands of yuan for short-term loans to facilitate circulation. Recently, Qian and Wang have been actively working on the matter and decided that the Four Banks, Xinhua, and Zhonghui would contribute 40,000 yuan each, totaling 120,000 yuan, to start the process. The details have been sent to Minister Wu Dingchang for approval. The funds will be allocated within days and loans will begin soon. The term is set at ten months, and the interest rate is the same as usual. The loan procedures are currently being discussed by the three.</p>
<p>Account Collector Lu Yinqing Sentenced for Breach of Trust - Imprisonment for Eight Months</p>
<p>Lu Yinsheng from Haiyan, who previously worked as an account collector at the British-owned Bianchang Textile Dyeing and Printing Company at 222 Sichuan Road, embezzled the promissory notes paid by customers and deposited the promissory notes of Huaming Bank into the company, totaling 10,241.98 yuan. As the notes were about to expire, Huaming Bank went bankrupt, causing the notes to be unredeemable. Lu also disappeared without a trace. Recently, Hua Detectives Song Yuanshan and Kang Zengxiang from the General Patrol Room arrested Lu. Lu was also involved with Lu Doushu from Nanxiang, the business director of the spot goods department of the company, so they went to arrest him. The case was handed over to the Special First Court for interrogation and adjourned. Lu Baoshu was allowed to be released on bail of 1,000 yuan. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide held a session in the First Criminal Court to continue the trial. After the lawyers for the patrol room, Ru Baoyi, and Lu Baoshu, Lu Congzu, debated, the judge announced the verdict: Lu Yinsheng was sentenced to eight months in prison for continuous breach of trust, and Lu Baoshu was found not guilty.</p>
<p>Tragic Accident: Heavy Iron Box Crushes Worker to Death</p>
<p>French Municipal Council Relocates to New Location - Truck Tilts, Causing Death and Injury</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council moved from the building with the Big Ben on Dama Road to the Western-style building at 1112 Xiafei Road, at the intersection of Shanzhong Road. Recently, due to insufficient space, they decided to renovate and move into the building of the French School opposite Shangxian Hall on Xiafei Road (the building was once used as a French barracks). The renovation has been completed, and they are currently relocating. Yesterday, Shanghai Barge Company at 51 Guangdong Road hired truck driver Huang Qirui to drive truck number 16576, F-1175, along with six or seven workers, to transport large silver boxes to the new building. At 12:00 noon, they were transporting two of the largest iron boxes, weighing over three tons. When the truck drove from Xiafei Road and turned south onto Malan Road, and arrived at 80, the side door of the Municipal Council's new building, the truck wheels sunk into the mud due to the soft road surface. The truck tilted, and the large iron boxes on the truck fell to the ground. At that time, worker Hua Ronggui (36 years old, from Yangzhou) fell to the ground first. The iron box crushed his head, causing his skull to shatter and his brains to spill out. He died instantly. Workers Shi Chenglian (43 years old, from Jiangbei) and another unnamed worker were also injured. Upon receiving the report, the Xiafei Road Patrol Room immediately sent detectives to the scene to send the two injured workers to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They transported Hua's body to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy and notified his family. They will report to the Special Second Court today and request that personnel be sent to examine the body.</p>
<p>Heji Bookbinding Shop's Arson for Insurance Scam</p>
<p>Detailed Presentation by Patrol Room Lawyer - Trial Concluded Yesterday, Verdict Pending</p>
<p>Heji Bookbinding Shop, located at 11, Lane 401, Jingzhou Road, suddenly caught fire around 2:00 AM on the 29th of last month. The nearby fire brigade rushed to extinguish the fire. Pan Yunlong, a Hua detective from the Yulin Road Patrol Room, investigated and confirmed that it was arson for insurance compensation of 6,000 yuan. The shareholders Zhang Xiangguan and Ni Dingyu, shop assistant Jiang Sanlin, and apprentice Zhu Zigen were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Fen presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer for the Municipal Council, stated that during the adjournment, it was found that the bookbinding shop was originally opened by Hong Huanzhang from Jingjiang, with the shop name Datong. The business was not doing well, and the defendants Zhang Xiangguan and Ni Dingyu were his employees. Around September 9th, they owed others money and could not maintain the business. Zhang and Ni were asked to take over, rename it Heji, with Hong holding 85% of the shares, Zhang 5%, and Ni 10%, to evade debts. They also insured 6,000 yuan with New Continent Fire Insurance on Huangpu Road 17, intending to commit arson for compensation. Later, with the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, they agreed with Zhang and Ni to instruct apprentice Zhu Zigen to move hundreds of copies of the Tang Zhu Wen Zhou Xiao Si Jie Zhuan (Tang, Zhu, Wen, Zhou, the Four Heroes) books ordered by the Hangzhou customer to room 55 of the Southern Hotel on Jiujiang Road. Hong had already cleared the room on the 26th and instructed the 12 apprentices to go to the New World Company for entertainment. Zhang, Ni, and Jiang gathered upstairs near the shop and set up the combustibles. Zhu Zigen lit the fire and fled to the hotel. It was found that Hong Huanzhang had opened the Datong Bookbinding Shop at 91, Lane 830, Kunming Road in July of last year and insured 5,000 yuan with the Taiping Company on Jiangxi Road. On the 15th of that month, he also used arson and received 1,109.24 yuan in compensation. Later, he moved to 11 Jingzhou Road, so he changed the shop name to Heji, fearing suspicion from the insurance company. This was Hong's second arson. He is now being prosecuted under Article 173, Paragraph 1, and Article 339, Paragraph 3, of the criminal code for endangering public safety and fraud. The judge interrogated the four defendants, and ordered them to be detained pending sentencing.</p>

<p>Contract Signed for Warehouse Construction Loan</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Province has borrowed 400,000 yuan from the China Farmers Bank to build four provincial warehouses. After discussion between Wu Tingyang, Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, and Zhu Runsheng, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the China Farmers Bank, a draft contract was agreed upon. It has now been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Hankou Head Office of the China Farmers Bank, and a formal contract has been signed. The term is three years, with a weekly interest rate of one cent. Interest will be paid in the 25th year, and principal will be repaid in the 26th and 27th years. The above refers to the total year. The above loan can be withdrawn from the Hangzhou Office of the China Farmers Bank at any time when the Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee builds the four provincial warehouses.</p>
<p>Construction Begins on Four Provincial Warehouses</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee has designated JinHua, AoJiang, HaiMen, and JiaShi as the locations for building four provincial warehouses. Now that the 400,000 yuan loan has been secured, construction will begin immediately. As for the county warehouses, it has been decided to borrow the original grain storage warehouses in various counties and townships for the time being. The original township warehouses are scheduled to be completed before the autumn harvest next year. It is stipulated that the main business of the provincial warehouses is to store, mortgage, and sell agricultural products.</p>
<p>China Farmers Bank Given Priority in Undertaking Storage and Mortgage</p>
<p>The China Farmers Bank has agreed with the Zhejiang Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee that after the completion of various provincial and county warehouses in Zhejiang Province, the China Farmers Bank will have priority in undertaking storage and mortgage loans. The total amount of storage and mortgage loans is set at 3 million National Currency, but can be increased at any time as needed. If the bank is unwilling to undertake the storage and mortgage loans, other banks may undertake them.</p>
<p>Slum Dwellers' Association Requests Permission to Repair Slum Housing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Slum Dwellers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To the Shanghai Municipal Council: We are writing to you because slum dwellers in Pudong have repeatedly petitioned the association, stating that the issue of the Municipal Council's order to demolish slum housing has been unresolved for months. Furthermore, requests to repair the housing have been rejected, and some have even been demolished for attempting repairs. We have received a notice from your council advising us to postpone repairs to avoid misunderstandings. However, since the beginning of summer, the housing has been eroded by wind and rain, is severely damaged, and is barely habitable. It is on the verge of collapse and urgently needs repair. Therefore, we respectfully request that your council issue a letter to the Municipal Council requesting that repairs be permitted before a comprehensive solution is reached, in order to ensure the safety of residents. We also request that, before the five measures proposed on August 31 are approved, slum dwellers be allowed to carry out repairs as necessary to reassure the people. We are enclosing a list of the door numbers of the slum houses requiring repair: (1) 574, 583, B-304, Meizhou Road; (2) 356, B-149, 145, 88, Hancheng Road; (3) 617, 361, 358, 356, 889, 929, 933, 934, 592, 593, 425, B-187, 588, Hangzhou Road. There are a total of 32 houses. We hope that you will notify the relevant patrol stations to avoid misunderstandings."</p>

Director Zhang will go to Beijing soon to visit Minister Wu to request additional funds.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lawyers' Association's New Association Building Contractor</p>
<p>Enterprise Construction Company Wins Bid with Lowest Price</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association is building a new association building. After the deadline for bidding, several meetings of the Building Committee were held, and construction experts were hired to review the qualifications of the bidders. The bid from Enterprise Construction Company was accepted, with a bid price of 96,000 yuan. To be cautious, the association sent a letter to the winning bidder a few days ago, limiting them to paying a cash deposit of 10,000 yuan and finding a reliable guarantor of 10,000 yuan within two days. The construction company has now paid the cash and found a guarantor and is in the process of signing the construction contract. The construction period is expected to be eight months. Other construction companies that did not win the bid are now collecting their deposits to clear the procedures.</p>
<p>Customs Office Abruptly Dismisses Five More Child Workers</p>
<p>There are a total of thirty-three child workers in the Customs Office. Six of them were dismissed by the Customs authorities. The other child workers, feeling a sense of shared fate, jointly petitioned the Customs authorities, requesting that the six child workers be retained and not dismissed. The request was not granted. The Customs authorities only agreed to prioritize their employment when the Customs Office has recruitment opportunities. Although the child workers were not satisfied, they could do nothing. However, starting from the first of this month, He Miaonian (Supervisor's Desk of the Import and Export Department), Xiao Yiwen (First Department), Chen Xuewen (Fifth Department), Jin Qinhu (Export Release Desk), and Liu Zhihua (Import General List Desk) were dismissed and replaced by new child workers. The other child workers were even more panicked. After joint consultations, they decided to continue appealing to the Customs Office authorities. The petition, signed by all the child workers, was submitted yesterday to the Jianghai Customs Commissioner, the Inspector General of Customs, and the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance. The purpose of the appeal is to request that the eleven child workers who have been dismissed be reinstated. If the decision cannot be reversed, they requested that retirement pay be issued to show compassion. Furthermore, the remaining child workers should not be dismissed arbitrarily on the grounds that their employment period has expired.</p>
<p>Five Cases of Smuggled Goods Confiscated on Sampan</p>
<p>Customs Patrol Room's officers 50 and 106 intercepted Jiangbei woman Wu Wang's sampan No. 973 at Xiaonanyang Wharf, Pudong, on the afternoon of the other day. The sampan was loaded with five pieces of large and small patterned clothing. Another person escorting the boat showed an invoice, claiming that the goods were shipped from Gantai Clothing Shop in Lujiazui, Pudong. The officers suspected that if the goods were indeed from Gantai, why were they being transported to Lujiazui for loading onto the boat? They brought the person and the goods to the patrol room. The escort claimed to be Xu Minsheng, entrusted by Xu Huanwen, the owner of Gantai Clothing Shop, to transport the goods to small clothing shops for sale. The patrol head then sent detective Hu Changqing to bring Zhang Youtian, the owner of Gantai, and the shop's account books to the patrol room. It was found that the goods listed on the invoice were not recorded in the account books, indicating that they were not the shop's goods. Zhang then admitted that he had privately purchased the goods from Diao Chaoqing, a foreman at Yongxing Clothing Stall in Lujiazui. The detective also brought Diao in for questioning. Diao claimed to have purchased them from Fang at different times. The patrol head suspected that Gantai Shop had a history of buying and selling smuggled goods and had been detained by the Public Security Bureau twice. He sent the three people to the Local Court. After questioning by Prosecutor Lei, they were ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<p>Abettor of Assault Case Two Years Ago Arrested</p>
<p>Gu Afu Thought the Matter Was Over - Unexpectedly Arrested When Obtaining License</p>
<p>Liu Fucai, a 40-year-old barber from Yangzhou and owner of a barber shop at 134 Gansidong Road, French Concession, was suddenly attacked from behind at 4:00 PM on September 16, 1934, at the entrance of Zhenxing Lane, Lane 10, at the intersection of Gansidong Road and Leimi Road. He was struck in the back with an axe by Qi Laoer, a carpenter from his hometown who lived on Xietu Road, Chinese territory. Detective Yang Zhongfang arrested Qi and sent Liu to the hospital for treatment. Qi was sent to the Special Second Court, and the police department prosecuted him for attempted murder. After the trial, Qi Laoer was sentenced to three years in prison for causing serious bodily harm on October 25 of the same year. During the trial, Qi confessed that he was instigated by Gu Afu, a native of Haimen who ran a stove at 5 Bugaoli, Ya'erpeilu, and the intersection of Fuli Road and Laidu Road, to harm Liu. Gu was not arrested at that time, and the court issued an arrest warrant. Two years later, Gu Afu thought that the case had been delayed for a long time and that the heat had passed. On the morning of the 7th, he went to the French Municipal Council to exchange his health license. Yang Zhongfang, the original detective who handled the case, learned of this and immediately rushed to arrest Gu and took him to the patrol room for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo conducted the hearing. Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer for the police department, stated the case, stating that the defendant was arrested on suspicion of abetting murder and requested an extension of the investigation before filing the case. Gu Afu stated that he did not know Liu Fucai. The incident was caused by Qi Laoer's wife having an affair with an employee of the stove he opened, which caused a quarrel that he intervened in. Qi falsely accused him of instigating the murder of Liu Fucai, but there was no such thing. Qi was released from prison this spring, and he had contacted him. After mediation by someone surnamed Cao, he was not prosecuted. He hired a lawyer to defend him and requested bail. The court ordered the case to be adjourned to the 12th for another hearing. The defendant was not granted bail because the case was still under investigation and was ordered to be detained.</p>
<p>Major Robbery Case on Meiyuan Road - Large Gang of Thieves Apprehended - Part of the Loot Recovered - Souvenirs Had Inscriptions</p>
<p>On the night of the 13th of last month, at 12:30 AM, the home of Jiang Defu, a rickshaw puller at 1, Beihengjili, Meiyuan Road, Zhabei, was robbed of silver, cash, gold and silver jewelry, clothing, etc., totaling more than 2,000 yuan. After the incident, Liu Huai, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was ordered by Director Cai Jinjun to solve the case within a time limit. Captain Liu, after receiving the order, turned to Bao Ziying, the captain of the detective team of the Xinzha Branch, to gather clues. Until recently, Captain Bao received a tip that the robbers were hiding in various places. In addition to arresting the robber's wife, Zhang Liu Lao Si (her husband's name is Zhang Arong, who has been arrested by the Central Patrol Room of the Public Concession), and Zhang San, etc., on the upper floor of 9 Dexingli, Guoging Road, Zhabei, who have already been sent to the Public Security Bureau. The team also arrested Huang Xilin, Fang Jinfeng, Zhang Xuejing, Yang Amao, and Jiang Zhiyong. Zhang Xuejing (also known as Xiao Lao Han) confessed that there were four guns, which Tang Ruyuan took and hid somewhere in Dachang. Therefore, at 4:00 AM yesterday morning, Captain Bao led the detective team to Dachang to retrieve the guns but was unsuccessful. Tang Ruyuan had already fled upon hearing the news. However, part of the loot was recovered at 105 Xinjiang Road, including two pairs of silver vases, a wine pot, and a souvenir cup, etc. with inscriptions. The upper inscription was Kun Xiansheng Jia Ti, etc. It was found that Kun was Jiang Defu's son. These loots were gifts given by relatives and friends when Jiang married Kun. It was also heard that Zhi Xiang, Zhao Jinbiao, Yao Shihai (also known as Yao Shitong), Shen Xu Shi, and Zhang Arong, etc. had been arrested by the Central Patrol Room of the Concession. The various bandits arrested in the Hua Concession are currently being interrogated.</p>

<p>Forging Xiong Xiling's Letter to Defraud Kong Xiangxi - Zeng Kui Unable to Transport Father's Coffin Back to Hunan - Forged Xiong's Letter Hoping to Obtain Assistance</p>
<p>Zeng Kui, also known as Zhi Su, a 24-year-old from Hunan and former clerk of the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau, is now unemployed. His father, Zeng Fengqi, an official of the Dali Court of the Northern Government, died of illness in the capital last year. The coffin is kept in the Capital Diaoyutai Natives' Association, as he was unable to transport it back to his hometown. He had a whimsical idea and forged a letter from Xiong Xiling (Zi Bing San), the former Premier of the Beijing government, to Shanghai's</p>
<p>Central Bank, seeking to see Minister Kong Xiangxi to request assistance. The letter addressed Minister Kong as "To Minister Zhisou, may you consider this, Xiong Bingsan", and stated "To Minister Yongzhi, may you consider this, Secretary Zeng Fengqi of the Dali Court, was a cousin of my Hunan Nong Ran philosopher, honest and upright, and of a poor family. I am deeply saddened to hear of his death in Shanghai. As his family is impoverished and unable to transport his coffin back home, I dare to ask you to show your love and generosity and grant him a burial allowance. Zhi Su is a talented young man with profound knowledge and will surely repay you in the future. I respectfully beg you for this and wish you peace. [Seal] Xiong Xiling, September 30." After the letter was delivered to the Central Bank, Minister Kong's secretary investigated. The investigation revealed that Xiong had gone to North China before July 4 of this year and had not yet returned to Shanghai. The handwriting and seal of the letters exchanged between Xiong and Minister Kong were also different. On the morning of the previous day, Zeng Kui went to the Central Bank again and was arrested by Chen Zongguang, a clerk in the administrative section, and sent to the Laozha Patrol Room. Yang Peisheng, the Hua patrol chief, and Detective Che Xuezeng investigated and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer for the patrol room, presented the previous situation and prosecuted him under Article 330, Article 212, and Article 217 of the criminal code for fraud and forging documents and seals, requesting for a fair trial. Chen Zongguang then submitted a report on the investigation of the case. Zeng Kui confessed that his father had served as a secretary in the Dali Court and died of illness in the capital last year. He was unable to transport him back to his hometown. Xiong Xiling was a fellow villager and had a family relationship with them. He knew Xiong's relationship with Minister Kong, so he forged a letter. The seal was obtained by his brother Zeng Zong. He asked for leniency and a chance to start anew. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained, setting next Thursday morning for sentencing.</p>
<p>Woman Enticed to Hotel by Lover, Coincidentally Met Fiancé</p>
<p>Zhang Yutian Intoxicated Woman with Alcohol, Arrested for Adultery and Sent to Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Wu Zhuang, a local woman who runs a Hongmu shop at 6, Deshunli, Hongqiao Yaojia Lane, Zhaojiabang Road, has a 17-year-old daughter named Lingmei who works as a sock toe sewer at Hongxing Sock Factory at 221 Caishi Road, French Concession. She boards at the back building of 209 near the factory and lives with her sisters who also work in the factory. In April of this year, she was engaged to Xia Baiyou (Depei), a staff member of the sock toe sewing department of Hongxing Sock Factory, through a matchmaker. The wedding was scheduled for December. Pan Wenhua, a young woman from Wujiang who lives with Lingmei in the pavilion room at 209 Caishi Road, is also Lingmei's close friend. Pan has a cousin named Zhang Yutian from Wujiang, who is 28 years old and works in a rubber factory at 472 Qudianren Road, Nanshi. When he came to Pan's place, he met Lingmei. After half a month, Zhang, who already has a wife, colluded with Pan Wenhua on the night of the 6th to invite Wu Lingmei to watch a dance at the Lido Ballroom on Ningbo Road, Public Concession. They first went to the ballroom, then returned to a dim sum shop near the Great World for a meal. They intoxicated Lingmei with alcohol and lured her to Room 55 of the Chunjiang Third Hotel at 65 Baligqiao Street, French Concession. After Pan Wenhua managed to escape, Zhang Yutian forcibly raped Wu Lingmei. Coincidentally, when Zhang Yutian and Pan Wenhua lured Wu Lingmei into the Chunjiang Third Hotel, they were seen by Wu Lingmei's fiancé, Xia Baiyou. Xia immediately ran to tell Lingmei's parents and went to the Chunjiang Hotel to catch the adulterer. The bellboy led them to open the door of Room 55 and found Zhang and Lingmei sleeping on the bed. They were detained and the police were called. After questioning by the police chief and investigation by detective Lu Zhenduo, it was determined that Wu Lingmei was forcibly raped against her will. She was handed over to her parents to take her back, and Zhang was detained. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Judge Tong Chaozuo conducted the trial. Yao Zhaodi, the lawyer for the police department, presented the case and prosecuted him under Article 240, Paragraph 3, of the criminal code. The court announced that the hearing was closed to the public because the case concerned morality. The plaintiff, Wu Zhuang, and her daughter, Wu Lingmei, filed a complaint about being seduced and raped. The defendant, Zhang Yutian, confessed to the crime. After reviewing the confession, the court ordered the debate to begin and then announced the conclusion, scheduling the verdict for the 12th. The defendant was detained.</p>

<p>Minister Yu Sends Zeng Guangqing to Inspect Nanyang Shipping Routes - Three-Month Inspection - Also Purchasing New Sea Vessels</p>
<p>In recent months, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has witnessed the thriving of Nanhua shipping, with congested cargo exports, a rare sight in the past decade. The number of goods being shipped to Shantou and Guangdong is particularly high. Apart from grains, cotton yarn and piece goods are struggling to be loaded. Goods arriving in Shanghai from the Yangtze River for transshipment to Nanhua are piling up in warehouses due to a lack of tonnage.</p>
<p>All Warehouses are Full</p>
<p>The Four Seas Steamship Company is fully loaded, and the company has realized that its sea vessels are insufficient to meet the demand. Last month, the revenue from cargo transported from Shanghai alone to Shantou and Guangzhou exceeded 330,000, breaking the business record of the past decade. With more vessels, the revenue would have been even higher. The Ministry of Communications summoned Shanghai shipping leaders Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Shen Zhongyi, and Cai Zengji to Beijing to discuss shipping. Zeng Guangqing, the business director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, also accompanied them. After discussing the proposals,</p>
<p>Minister Yu Instructed</p>
<p>Cai Zengji to expedite the development of Nanyang shipping and implement the company's planned expansion steps. Cai then instructed Zeng Guangqing to meet with Minister Yu to discuss everything. Yu instructed Zeng to personally inspect Singapore, Little Luzon, and the Java Islands in Nanyang to understand the current situation of Shanghai's ships and the sales volume of Chinese goods in various ports, in order to lay the foundation for expanding shipping routes. As the company lacks sea vessels, Yu instructed Zeng to look for vessels that meet the "Ministry-stipulated fee limit" (i.e., age, vessel price, etc.) and request to purchase them. The Ministry appointed</p>
<p>Lao Mian to temporarily act as Business Director</p>
<p>Zeng Guangqing has returned to Shanghai and is busy preparing for his departure. The trip is expected to last three months. Zeng has decided to take the company's Haili steamship to Hong Kong on the 14th of this month, then transfer to various parts of Nanyang. If the procedures are not completed in time, he will definitely take the Haiyuan steamship on the 17th. The company is actively expanding its shipping routes. The Sichuan River steamship Emei will be restored and has already entered the dock yesterday (after being berthed for more than a year and a half). Various shipyards are estimating the cost of repairs.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy's Grand Opening Ceremony Tomorrow</p>
<p>News Media and Guests Invited - Cordial Atmosphere - 30th Anniversary Commemorative Address and Speech</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy has been in business for 30 years. Under the dedicated management of former manager Xiang Songmao, its business has grown steadily. Its Gubenfat soap is able to compete with foreign soaps. It is of good quality and inexpensive, and can be called the best in domestic soap. The original location was at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Henan Road, with more than two mu of land. The old buildings were old and insufficient, so it was decided last year to build a ten-story building. After deducting the land collected by the Municipal Council according to regulations, there is still a little less than two mu. The new building has been completed and is novel and practical. The towering building stands tall in the center of the Public Concession, which is a great achievement for Chinese people in business. A few days ago, Gao Fengchi, the standing director of the company, and Xiang Shengwu, the manager, hosted a luncheon for Chinese and foreign journalists in Shanghai. During the luncheon, Chinese and foreign guests exchanged speeches and had a very cordial atmosphere. The grand opening ceremony is scheduled to be held tomorrow. The company's 30th anniversary commemorative address, Manager Xiang's speech, and a photograph of the building are published on the left.</p>
<p>30th Anniversary Commemorative Address</p>
<p>Our company was founded in 1907 AD, which is the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was not organized as a company. The formal establishment of the company was actually in the 4th year of the Republic of China. Business gradually became more complex, and capital also increased year by year, from 100,000 taels to 500,000 taels, to 1 million taels, to 1.5 million yuan. With the expansion of business, branches spread at home and abroad, which was probably not our original wish. To achieve this, we have received the support and guidance of our government and people from all walks of life. Now that the new building has been completed, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the company's founding, we reflect on the past and encourage ourselves for the future. We dare to express our feelings, hoping that all those who love our company will continue to support us. Our company's 30-year history has things that we should never forget. First, the leaders in the initial stage were talented. Mr. Xia Cuifang had great talent and strategy, and led the way. Mr. Xiang Songmao succeeded him, with diligence and determination, and focused on management. These two gentlemen had great talent, ambition, and courage. Two talented people gathered in one hall, shining one after another, and cooperated sincerely, leading to success and prosperity. Our company's unyielding foundation has a source.</p>
<p>Second, the business policy over the years has been purely progressive and self-reliant. We never follow the old ways. We overcome any difficulties with deep wisdom and courage. We strive to develop our own strengths and never seek life through dependence. If we have any surplus strength, we must fully develop it according to a sound strategy, in order to achieve the glory and greatness of our cause. We must never miss the opportunity. For example, we initially sold foreign medicines. After preparations reached a considerable level, we immediately engaged in self-manufacturing. In addition to manufacturing medicines, we also engaged in soap manufacturing, and extended to all chemicals. The Taihe Pharmacy, Gubenfat Soap Factory, Yalin Odor Water Factory, Zhonghua Xingji Soap Factory, Nanyang Wood Stopper Factory, Dongwu Cotton Factory, etc., were all transferred to us one after another. We received them with sincerity and solid strength</p>

<p>申報文藝專刊 Charity Workers and Cooling Medicine  Luo Feng</p>
<p>A few days ago, I caught a bit of a cold again, and I didn't bother to take any medicine. I didn't want to buy any either. Actually, if I had the money, I would stay in a hospital—but I felt that the illness was quite severe and I couldn't hold on any longer. So, I happened to remember that there was still a bottle of cooling medicine in my little leather bag, just one bottle given to me three years ago by that charity worker. I don't know if it was the medicine's efficacy, but after drinking it, the heat all over my body actually subsided a lot. But, regardless, I am grateful to that charity worker who is thousands of miles away, because, for me, it was indeed a very appropriate relief.</p>
<p>Yes, the fever subsided, and my mind gradually cleared up. This made me recall a matter concerning that charity worker three years ago. So, I am writing it down:</p>
<p>Being a charity worker was not his profession. At that time, he was serving as the Chief of the General Affairs Section in the Songpu Municipal Bureau. At the same time, because the charity worker had excellent social skills, no, precisely because of his charitable nature, he was hired by our Railway Bureau Director to be a secretary—this was a side job—such an opportunity allowed us to be close to each other often.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, a small clerk originally did not have the qualifications or opportunity to be close to a secretary. However, this charitable secretary was very different from the others. He always treated everyone—rich, poor, with a charitable heart, without discrimination. It was precisely because he could do this that the charity worker succeeded. He not only gained a good reputation among the small clerks of the railway, but also among the poor residents within his directly governed Songpu municipal district. In other words, he gained the support of the general public. Needless to say, this kind of support did not come from political influence, nor did it come from planning road administration, but from his charity.</p>
<p>An old man in his fifties—his hair and beard were all white, and two of his front teeth had fallen out—treating people with the innocence of a child was, after all, commendable. Although I myself am no longer a child; however, in this society, what I dislike is: old people. What is the most appropriate analogy for him? It is as if he is a poisonous mushroom parasitizing on a decaying old tree. However, our old man is not a mushroom, but a spirit fungus, which is why he is precious.</p>
<p>He is skilled at creating impressions. He is like a floating cloud in the clear sky, ever-changing, forming beautiful clouds. Sometimes, he even makes people fall into that illusion, yearning for him, yearning for his career.</p>
<p>An old man.</p>
<p>A charity worker.</p>
<p>A spirit fungus.</p>
<p>Spring should be the time when spirit fungus thrives the most. Spring is the time when epidemics are prevalent. Spring is also the time for our charity worker to vent his charity.</p>
<p>Like migratory birds, at the end of autumn, he returns from the north to his hometown, Shaoxing, Zhejiang—waiting for the coming spring, he returns to the north again. When he goes back, I don't know what he takes with him, but when he returns, he brings back many, many bottles of cooling medicine.</p>
<p>Thus, epidemics seem to be the consumers of cooling medicine, coming in a constant stream.</p>
<p>Thus, the charity worker has also become an introducer of cooling medicine and epidemics.</p>
<p>One day, on the shuttle bus from Majia Wharf to Songpu for work, I met the charity worker again. Of course, he greeted me again with the commendable innocence of a child. Afterward, he suddenly said to me with great concern:</p>
<p>"Your complexion doesn't look very good, are you sick?"]</p>
<p>"Me? In short: there isn't a comfortable moment in a year of three hundred and sixty thousand days!"</p>
<p>"Oh! This phenomenon is most terrible in young people!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it, there's no way."</p>
<p>"Well, then I'd like to introduce you to a medicine..."</p>
<p>The charity worker looked up with a kind face, waiting for my answer. However, how should I answer him? I do have an illness, this kind of prevalent life illness, which naturally cannot be cured with any medicine. But the charity worker deliberately misunderstood my words, so I had to deliberately, no, it could also be said that I replied insincerely.</p>
<p>"What medicine?" I thought to say: "Cooling medicine?"</p>
<p>The one the charity worker introduced to me was no different from what I thought. Moreover, he insisted on giving me a dozen bottles. He promised to bring them to me tomorrow. Then, he said:</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, your wife is an editor at a newspaper, is that true?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"This is really not an easy thing, especially for a woman."</p>
<p>"It doesn't require much talent. I think it's very common in the south, right?"</p>
<p>"Um... no, no, it's just as surprising to have such women in the south!" Then, he said again:</p>
<p>"I have something to ask of you. You can definitely do it, and it's a matter of public virtue from every aspect... Don't you want to do something of public virtue? Nowadays, the times and people's hearts have become as bad as they can get!... No wonder there are so few people doing public virtue!"</p>
<p>"Yes, what can I do? I don't object to public virtue."</p>
<p>"Very good. Regarding the matter of me giving away cooling medicine, please have your wife write an article to be published in the newspaper. You know, poor people can't afford medicine when they're sick."</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied coldly as before, "but I'm disappointed. She's in charge of literature and art, and someone else is responsible for the news."</p>
<p>"Oh, what kind of literature and art does she edit?"</p>
<p>"Novels and things like that..."</p>
<p>"That's good, just have her write a novel now."</p>
<p>"Sorry, she can edit, but she can't write."</p>
<p>"Oh, this..."</p>
<p>He was even more disappointed than I was. However, he was still smiling kindly.</p>
<p>The next day, this charity worker gave me two bottles of cooling medicine. Then, he waited for me to explain:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he started by using my words to answer him, "Originally, there were many more, but I wasn't home yesterday, and someone took them all at once. These two bottles, I found them in the drawer. Use them first, and when another box is opened, I'll send you ten more to replenish them."</p>
<p>An old man doing things so conscientiously is probably really rare in the world!</p>
<p>A few days later, at Majia Wharf...</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau Director and the Municipal Bureau Director jointly introduced the matter of our charity worker giving away cooling medicine. I was secretly pleased with the effect of this kind of publicity, which must be even greater than the power in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Sure enough, before long, the name of this charity worker was circulating everywhere, just like his cooling medicine. Especially in the poor areas, that name was almost enshrined by the people.</p>
<p>What name was it? It was not so-and-so, the Chief of General Affairs, nor was it just a silent charity worker, it was:</p>
<p>Living Bodhisattva who relieves suffering and saves lives.</p>
<p>However, ever since the charity worker had a "selling goods that shouldn't be sold" accident, this world has become very confusing to me. Just imagine: a group of extremely poor people, who were rescued from suffering by the living Bodhisattva, instead listed many charges—one, embezzling disaster relief funds; two, colluding with bandits in hopes of getting rewarded; three, seizing public land and forcibly demolishing civilian houses to grow vegetable gardens...— jointly accused him to the Municipal Bureau. Is this right? Although this joint accusation did not have any effect; however, the reputation of this charity worker was greatly diminished because of this!</p>
<p>Afterward, I asked him:</p>
<p>"How do you feel about this unexpected misfortune?"</p>
<p>The charity worker shook his head as if he couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>"I don't have anything... I am always tolerant of others, and I always use my true heart to influence all beings... However, this time, the stabs they gave me were too deep, what can I do!"</p>
<p>Are poor people, as the charity worker said, rarely have a "conscience?" Because I myself am not a very poor person, so I cannot prove it for the time being. Only the charity worker claims that his heart is true, but I dare not fully believe it. This is because the bottle of cooling medicine that he promised to replenish for me, from spring to autumn, has not yet been given to me.</p>
<p>Stealing a Camp  Tang Tao</p>
<p>—A Person's Self-Description—</p>
<p>This is a dream, but also a fact.</p>
<p>Facing the evening breeze, bathing in the moonlight, I am walking on a slope. This slope is sometimes high, sometimes low. I sometimes walk with a slight stoop, and sometimes with my neck straightened, approaching the mountainside. I am walking a little breathlessly. My short shirt is soaked with sweat. The evening breeze blows, and it feels cold and greasy, sticking to my back. But I don't feel sad at all. My heart is burning like a fire, and I don't even think of resting my blistered feet. Wild thorns pierce my skin, and fresh red blood flows down, flows down, as if they are markers made by a lost person.</p>
<p>I am surprised: I actually have so much blood. I am surprised: my blood is actually so red! I am surprised and worried, because I don't know what things will grow on this ground due to the irrigation of this blood.</p>
<p>It may only help the growth of some vines, or only nourish some rattan thorns. Perhaps, these rattan thorns and vines will also pierce the skin of those who come later, causing them to bleed as well.</p>
<p>The blood of countless later comers will surely cultivate bright flowers. I believe it.</p>
<p>Having passed through many flat slopes, I walk happily, proudly trampling on the rattan thorns under my feet, trampling on the vines under my feet, although my feet are often pierced and bleeding. Before this blood has dried, I have already reached the foot of the mountain. What lies in front of me is a lofty mountain range. Under the cold moonlight, it appears very deep and very serene. I follow the foot of the mountain, searching for the path to ascend, searching for the large bluestone slabs. All I encounter are negative spurs covered with moss. I walk carefully, stepping on them. Perhaps a venomous snake is hiding in the moss, or perhaps our enemies are hiding in the reeds, their gun muzzles aimed at me. But I am not afraid. My heart is burning like a fire. I finally find that bluestone slab. Behind the bluestone slab is a small path covered by wild kudzu. I use both hands to brace myself on the ground, slowly crawling up. I part the kudzu vines, those purple little flowers, but also often hide my body under the kudzu field.</p>
<p>My hands are all cut open, but I don't feel any pain. How could I feel pain! The mountain becomes steeper and steeper. Clinging to the kudzu vines, I inch my way up. Once, I even grabbed the tail of a white-flowered snake. The oily, cold feeling made me quickly retract my hand, and at the same time, made it quickly flee away.</p>
<p>Crawling carefully, crawling, crawling so skillfully, so bravely, it almost makes me forget that I am a human being with two feet; forget that I am in the mountains in the middle of the night; forget that I am in the enemy's forbidden territory. I keep climbing upward. After about two miles, I have already reached the middle of the mountain, and I can see the lights in the enemy camp on the opposite hillside. I breathe a sigh of relief, wipe the sweat from my face, and continue to climb up.</p>
<p>When I arrive at the dilapidated earth shrine on the mountaintop, it is already past midnight. The moonlight is very dim, and the dense birch forest echoes with harsh crane cries. Looking at the railway watch I brought with me, I know it is not yet the appointed time. I check the pistol, bullets, and signal flares that I brought with me, and even have the time to examine the bloody marks on my hands and feet. I am very happy, because when my signal flare is lit, the brothers will begin the hunt. Yes, it is a hunt. Let's see these beasts fall into our hands!</p>
<p>But, but I beg you to excuse me from describing what happened afterward, because I really dare not believe the ending of this matter.</p>
<p>A "Water Traveler"  Fei Er</p>
<p>I don't know his name, although his face seems very familiar to me.</p>
<p>That was when I was traveling up the Zambezi River, on a small steamer of the K.P.M. shipping company. Judging from his appearance and behavior, I know for sure that he is a "water traveler" who travels up and down this river—that is, those who follow the ships, carrying odd goods, drifting between the islands of Southeast Asia, transporting and selling goods everywhere.</p>
<p>"Your face is very familiar, it seems like I've met you before." Being bored on the ship, I took the opportunity to start a conversation with him.</p>
<p>This thin man, wearing a cotton silk undershirt and rayon trousers, his skin steamed into a reddish-brown by the equatorial sun, furrowed his brow when he heard my words, hesitated for a moment, and said:</p>
<p>"I think so too. Did you ever visit Batavia?"</p>
<p>"I have been there: I went there four years ago."</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's right, you are Mr. Xu who used to live in Yuanfeng."</p>
<p>Then I also remembered. This person was a shop assistant at Yuanfeng four years ago, surnamed Li, and his name was—what was his name again, I can't remember.</p>
<p>But I said:</p>
<p>"Is Yuanfeng doing well now?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," he replied. "I've been gone for two years too. It was certainly very good then. The boss smuggled a batch of goods and made a fortune—but I left at that time too."</p>
<p>"Why? Aren't you an old friend of the boss?" I was quite surprised.</p>
<p>"Old friend?" He sneered, stroking the coarse beard under his chin.</p>
<p>"Do you think that old friends are old friends? No, no! I now believe more in new friends who are poor as partners. Running a small shop and working for a living can make you old friends; but those who have become wealthy are not easy to make friends with."</p>
<p>I don't understand his words. I thought this was his complaint; he must have had some kind of conflict with the boss of Yuanfeng.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xu, I, Lao Li, have traveled all over the Dutch East Indies, and there's nothing I haven't done. Even going to the sugar cane plantation, I would have a bowl of rice to eat. What's so great about that Yuanfeng boss? Isn't he getting rich by exploiting our labor? Ha, ha, he blamed me for reading newspapers, blamed me for learning to read, blamed me for joining the young people's 'China Society'. What is this supposed to mean? Does he expect me to learn how to sign my name like a foreigner, and go to the 'Mayor' or the foreigner's place to sign a paper when something happens? He said the Mayor hates the 'China Society'. What does that have to do with me? Do I not know about the foreigner's machines? He said the Mayor was angry, and my job would not be secure. Does reading newspapers also constitute a crime? Others can go to universities to study, but I can't even read newspapers. Old Yuanfeng doesn't recognize characters, but he can make a fortune. I feel that I have suffered from not knowing how to read all my life: in Tangshan, a small plot of land was cheated away by others with a deed; traveling to Southeast Asia, I was transformed into a 'piglet' with a contract of indenture. I said, I must help the 'China Society'. Does teaching compatriots to read also constitute a crime? Later, Yuanfeng became very wealthy—just a year ago, he became related to the Mayor through marriage, and his position became secure. He took out a hundred guilders and told me to return to Tangshan. He said:</p>
<p>"Lao Li, we are old partners. You have been away from your hometown for a long time, and you should go back and take a look."</p>
<p>"What?" I shouted, "Now that your business is good, you don't need someone like me who can do hard labor!—Don't you know that I don't have a single plot of land in Tangshan, not even a thatched house, not a single relative?"</p>
<p>"I threw the hundred guilders back to him. I immediately packed my luggage and left. I didn't expect the young poor partners of the 'China Society' to help me. They gave one guilder and fifty cents each, at most three mei, and pooled together to help me travel. I thought of the many poor partners in the Zambezi River area who came from the 'piglet' trade, so I ran here. These people also helped me become a small 'water traveler', earning money by transporting goods for others, scraping together a bowl of rice to eat. Think about it, I will always believe that when a person becomes lucky, they are not good enough to be a friend;—think about it, when the Yuanfeng boss was setting up a stall, how good he was to me, really old brothers, but now—it's like my group of people, fearing neither heaven nor earth, able to eat coarse food, and also able to carry a hundred or two hundred catties of goods on our backs, that's what good friends are!"</p>
<p>This person finished recounting his experiences in one breath, leaving me no room to interject. I was also very interested in listening, because this kind of "philosophy of life" is indeed moving in its own way.</p>
<p>But I still asked foolishly:</p>
<p>"Isn't traveling on the water difficult enough?"</p>
<p>He swept his strong palm through the air, and laughed happily:</p>
<p>"The customs' difficulties, the crew's bullying, the merchants' stinginess, and sometimes even the fear of losing one's life on the ship... but listen to it, and do the best one can when one can't bear it. Do you think I will never have good fortune in the future; at least some of my partners will enjoy it in the future." By the time I disembarked from the Zambezi River's Fula Port, this person had already left before me. When he disembarked from the Bulilo Port, I saw him wearing a pair of worn rubber shoes, shouldering a heavy burden, and carrying many delicate and heavy things in both hands, walking resolutely on the main road under the scorching sun. I watched his slender and strong back disappear from my sight. Then a pleasant feeling floated up in my heart for some reason, as if this thin man had given me something.</p>
<p>Farewell Emotion  Sakurako</p>
<p>After deciding on my travel dates, I don't know why, I suddenly felt reluctant to leave Guihuacheng, a place I had become a little tired of living in, and that craggy Daqing Mountain, which I was weary of seeing. This might be what people call "farewell emotion," right?</p>
<p>"Farewell emotion"? What farewell emotion could there be for someone like me who is used to wandering? Although this time it is a relatively long journey and I will be gone for many days. But for a young person like me, it doesn't really count for anything. What I am concerned about is what this large city in the frontier grassland will become when I return one day. It's as if I am about to part with a lover suffering from an incurable disease, and my heart is filled with endless sadness, knowing what this lover will become when I return? Ruins? A "kingdom of benevolence"? Thinking of this, how can the heart of a young person like me not feel a deep attachment to this frontier grassland! People, after all, are emotional animals!</p>
<p>When I began to feel attached to the city I was about to leave, everything on the grassland and the vast sky became dear to me. These days, every day, I go from the old city to the new city, or from the new city to the old city. Whether it's in the early morning or near dusk, when I look up, there is that clear, deep blue sea-like sky. A few white clouds swirl and fly past. The autumn wind gently caresses my cheeks. The tall poplar trees on both sides of the road cast wide shadows. Distant villages are surrounded by surrounding crops, revealing a peaceful scene of rural countryside. Even the mournful, wailing sound of the chimney of the wool factory is dear to me. (To be continued)</p>
<p>What Kind of Poet is Bedny?  Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>If you talk about the Soviet poetry scene today, perhaps the poet Bedny will be the first to be mentioned. Yes, Bedny is the most typical and most talented poet. It is not accidental that he received the praise of Ilyich and the fervent love of the people.</p>
<p>Bedny has already lived a poetic life for twenty-five years. He has consistently and bravely stood in the ranks of the entire Soviet people from the most chaotic and dangerous era, through the Great Revolution, the New Economic Policy, and to the present when the Second Five-Year Plan is about to be completed, serving as the unique trumpeter.</p>
<p>Bedny is a poet who specializes only in poetry, or rather, a poet who excels at satirical poetry. In 1911, during the Russian proletarian movement, he appeared on the scene wielding his pen "as a person with only a possible form of activity." In order to make the precise broad mind of the movement to broaden and perspective to write answers in "Pravda", Zhivacheva Qi Da, successively published fables, news vignettes, aphorisms (short mock poems). Today, Gen-write long satirical poems and recitative poems, he stands before a large group of listeners, singing the simple and poetry. "Out of the most important questions about political life!"</p>
<p>He has always worked hard in this way.</p>
<p>"Strong in purpose, clear topicality, and the direction of the fighting Bolsheviks—these are the most distinctive features of Bedny's poetry." (Literature News editorial)</p>
<p>Therefore, he picked up his special weapon, and during the era of the civil war, the White Russian generals, the Constitutional Democratic Party, the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the Menshevik hillbillies, and the wealthy peasants became his targets for shooting. At the same time, he sang the praises of his own military forces, and read of heroism and dedication, questioning the cowardly and the deserters. In the era of revival, the era of socialist construction, he mocked bureaucracy, the remnants of capitalism in lifestyle, the church, and the White Guards abroad, etc.</p>
<p>In order to dedicate the most welcome weapon to the vast masses of people, that is, to express the simplicity of language in the clarity of simple content. He studied folk songs, legends, and oral traditions, taking pains to closely link them with his own creations, exerting effort to tense up the lines of poetry, and desperately striving to make the content of his poetry reach the consciousness of millions of readers. Therefore, he did not forget to critically absorb the results of classical realist poetry and the democratic poetic traditions of the 1860s, and to nurture the infinitely rich harvest of his own poetic creation. Because he grasped the simple and popular poetic form, according to his satirical talent, he permeated the answers to the political questions and the wisdom of criticism into the content of fables, popular songs, satires, and other satires. For example, far between "February" and "October," he wrote the famous fable "Soldier Jessica, Brass and Iron," and many popular songs such as "Madam." In the popular song "Madam" that sings of war, it is very interesting to insert the satirical repetition of "Is this true? Madam!" When the Kerensky cabinet declared war on Germany, he also wrote interesting sentences in popular songs to repay Kerensky.</p>
<p>Freedom? But it doesn't say what kind of freedom.</p>
<p>That freedom is not the freedom of the people.</p>
<p>However, the peak of his activities as a poet reached the era of "war communism." In 1923, he was awarded an honorary medal as a poet. Let's take a look at the words of the commendation of the All-Soviet Central Executive Committee:</p>
<p>"Your works are simple and understandable to everyone. And very powerfully ignite the revolutionary torch in the hearts of the working class, and in the most difficult era of struggle, you have strengthened spiritual health."</p>
<p>Yes, his spirit is very healthy. For example, in 1920, he wrote a hymn of labor with bright and majestic rhythm. Looking at the following lines of poetry makes it clear.</p>
<p>Forward! Forward! Forward! Forward!</p>
<p>All comrades, our guards!</p>
<p>Yesterday a gun—today a hoe!</p>
<p>Work hard, comrades!</p>
<p>But that is by no means an unskilled slogan, he also abstractly dissects the reality of capitalism in simplicity. Such as:</p>
<p>Living streams are poured into it,</p>
<p>Let us cultivate a garden on the sandy land!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>From every corner of the beloved Russia,</p>
<p>Let us restore it to a blossoming paradise!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>However, the completion of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan in four years and the great success of the sweeping Stakhanov movement that suddenly arose in the construction of the First Five-Year Plan, in such a concrete development of the heroic reality and a highly three-dimensional unfolding, the poet Bedny, the great simplicity, popularity, high political nature, correct topical criticism, spiritual health, profound satire of the work, through his new realism creation method, and the creation of more complex and greater themes of positive poetry with pleasant and cheerful rhythm of speech is natural. Now he has already sent out a huge work to the world, which is a long satirical narrative poem collection "The Gospel of the Holy Christ". Thus, Lesou, the historical figure of the imaginary bottom, is exposed in the pen of the poet with an organic shape of all the ugliness. This religion is not only a major obstacle on the road to new culture, but also a cultural aggression tool that imperialism has always adopted. At the same time, the poet also shows the "most energetic and vivid Christ" and "serious Gospel" on the ground according to the artist's feeling. Bedny's self-Gospel can be investigated under the purpose of the following lines.</p>
<p>Rescue women,</p>
<p>Cut off the long night of women,</p>
<p>Grasp the hands of women intimately,</p>
<p>In order to lead her to the world of the daytime……</p>
<p>Gorky's Quotations  Lin</p>
<p>Life is a serious game.</p>
<p>The meaning of life exists in the beauty and strength of leaping toward the goal. Therefore, every moment of real life should have its own noble purpose.</p>
<p>The misfortune of many people is due to the fact that they mistakenly regard themselves as higher than they actually are.</p>
<p>A person is proud when they have hope, a place to go, and something to get: but once they reach the goal, it ends plainly.</p>
<p>The value of a person is determined according to the degree of their resistance to the power of real life.</p>
<p>The wisdom of real life is often deeper and broader than human wisdom.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to buy five cents with two cents.</p>
<p>People often commit crimes in loneliness and boredom.</p>
<p>A self-satisfied person is a hardened tumor in the bosom of society.</p>
<p>On earth, there is more suffering for good people than for bad people.</p>
<p>The world today refers to villains as gentlemen.</p>
<p>A happy person is the enemy of all.</p>
<p>Evil people often live long lives.</p>
<p>There are sometimes people in mankind who have very complex personalities. Although it is impossible to call him anything, it is just that he is not suitable for the name of man.</p>
<p>The brevity of good things is just like the scarcity of beautiful things.</p>
<p>Good fruit does not ripen early.</p>
<p>What is born in the ground is not incapable of flying.</p>
<p>A person who does not know what to do tomorrow is unfortunate.</p>
<p>There are many gentlemen in the world. But what the world needs is a complete person.</p>
<p>Human behavior has two sides. One is false, and the other is hidden. One is true.</p>
<p>There are people who live in the soil, but are more spotless than those who wear fine clothes and play.</p>
<p>People do not pay attention to the small good things that are currently happening, and once they have passed, they want to see them.</p>
<p>Whether in good or bad things, people are not the entirety.</p>
<p>Life cannot help those who know their value.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the world as important and interesting as the motives of human behavior.</p>
<p>In this world, everything is relative. Therefore, there is no absolute rebel in this world that makes people helpless.</p>
<p>The relationship with the enemy is precisely the relationship between the hungry and the well-fed.</p>
<p>Everyone says kowtow as if it is a slogan with compatriots, but no one has proved this from the household registration.</p>
<p>Everything has an end. This is the main characteristic of life.</p>

<p>The Road to Health Editor-in-chief of Kangjian Pharmaceutical Company Gonorrhea Experiment Gonorrhea Mislead American Venereologist Authority Written by Moller Neelsen M.D. Translated and excerpted by Chen Minbo, a graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan A fundamental solution needed by gonorrhea patients 130,000 men and women in Paris have achieved satisfactory results Sometimes after having intercourse with a prostitute, if you find that you have suspected gonorrhea, you should try to save yourself. Because once a person is infected with gonococcus, various complications will occur quickly in a short period of time, leading to extinction, and it will become more and more dangerous. Extinction According to the latest medical research today, crippling arthritis and peritonitis, which can easily lead to sudden death, are the most common. These dangerous pathological changes are all caused by gonococcus invading the blood from the urethra; and there is a possibility of such complications occurring at any time after being infected with gonorrhea. Therefore, every patient should conduct in-depth research on this serious matter. You must know that the earlier the treatment, the less the danger, and the faster the recovery. The important thing is that patients must strictly observe hygiene for a period of time, such as avoiding labor, sexual intercourse, and spicy and sour foods, so that it is easier to use medicine. Gonorrhea, whether in men or women, whether acute or chronic, is not an incurable disease. Dr. B erlander, a professor of venereology at Hopkins Vniversity, once recorded his field investigation in his book "Gonorrhea Self-Treatment". He announced that there were as many as 142,000 people in Paris, France, suffering from gonorrhea—including orchitis and prostatitis caused by gonorrhea infertility, as well as women's leukorrhea infertility and uterine inflammation. Among them, 134,008 people were cured by taking the protein chromogen "Kelinong". And most of the women's leukorrhea also use "Carer Xue Di" as a suppository. Indeed, I have also used this method for clinical trials, and generally, the most satisfactory complete effect can be achieved in about one or two months. Fill the Sexual Life Defect Long-married Infertility Savior Written by Professor Wellesley Translated by Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University A healthy and flawless person must have a fully developed body and a happy spirit. He also always feels satisfied and comforted in his sexual life. This is originally the necessary happiness that God bestows on every human being. But many people do not have this happiness, and they suffer from endless and difficult-to-get-rid-of pain and sorrow, as if God did not give them happiness but only gave them pain. In fact, it is not. They lost this happiness and brought endless pain because they prematurely added masturbation and excessive lust during puberty, causing the sexual organs to lose their healthy structure, and all the symptoms of dissatisfaction in sexual life appeared completely. The most common symptoms of sexual life defects that we see are small genitals, decreased erectile power of the penis, and inability to perform the task of sexual life. Spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission, seeing-sex seminal emission, etc. are all iron evidence of sexual life defects. Symptoms such as insomnia, headache, palpitations, forgetfulness, pessimism, depression, easy boredom, and weak back and legs are all manifestations of neurasthenia. Those who suffer from the above symptoms have very fragile and pitiful fertility. We often see this pitiful sum of money, how sexually depressed he feels! Regarding the rescue of those who have been married for a long time due to sexual life defects, Professors Modesims and Nightingale, Swedish physiologists, repeatedly discussed this issue in detail during their lectures at the Philippa University Medical School. The final conclusion was that those who suffer from sexual life defects that lead to long-term infertility can take large amounts of "Butikang". He said that "Butikang" was invented by Mr. Melun of Germany, and is made of hormones extracted from animals during puberty. It has an absolute and great effect on transforming sexual tissues and promoting endocrine activity. He has used "Butikang" to cure five people who have been married for ten years without pregnancy, and more than 20 people who have been married for six years without pregnancy. Nearly 100 people have been married for three years without pregnancy. Naturally, many of these infertile people are caused by sexual life defects. Therefore, in order to increase the population and strengthen the national physique, "Butikang" medicine is very popular in European and American countries, and governments of all countries have specially approved duty-free imports. - Excerpted from American Strong Clan Magazine, Volume 1, Issue 2. (Translator's note: When I was studying at the Russian Labor University Medical School, the Russian government had already exempted "Butikang" medicine from tariffs.) Spermatorrhea Savior Masturbation Spermatorrhea Quick Treatment Before Marriage Graduated from Army Medical University Song Zhongyu, Physician Spermatorrhea Uncured Is Equivalent to Bleeding Every Day It Can Also Break Sweet Love Masturbation is generally committed by people before development and before marriage. Because of repeated offenses, the seminal gate is relaxed, the ejaculation center nerve is fragile, and loses its normal function, so it is released at a touch. The pleasure gradually decreases and disappears. This disease must be cured before marriage. It is hoped that the love between husband and wife will be maintained in the future. If not treated early, the disease will inevitably increase after marriage. Because the other party does not feel sexual satisfaction, the love will break down and become irreparable. The most effective way to deal with such masturbation and spermatorrhea diseases is to take "Nerish Spermatorrhea Tablets" internally. This tablet can strengthen the seminal gate and enhance the jurisdiction of the ejaculatory duct. It can also suppress the evil thoughts of masturbation. Therefore, it can be quickly cured. Anyone who has masturbation spermatorrhea before marriage should take this tablet as soon as possible to achieve a radical cure. However, if spermatorrhea has induced neurasthenia and sexual dysfunction, "Butikang" can be taken together. To nourish the nerves and strengthen the body. Consolidate sexual function. It can also help control the disease of spermatorrhea. Therefore, it is most appropriate to take the two medicines together. Gospel of Body Tabacco Quitting Physician Yang Daonan Most people who want to quit smoking have a fearful mentality, thinking that it will cause old diseases and pain is inevitable. Or because of the unsound physique and can not bear the pain of quitting. Therefore, according to my years of clinical experience, to solve these two problems, only by implementing the body tobacco quitting method can the physique of the quitter be taken care of, the pain be avoided, and the will of the quitter be strengthened. The body tobacco quitting method was invented by Dr. Melun of Germany, that is, using the hormone and lecithin contained in "Butikang" to strengthen the body of the quitter, so as to enhance the power of resisting tobacco toxins, and on the one hand, it can prevent the erosion of diseases, so the quitter will not suffer any pain, and it is safe and effective. Gu Hanqiu, 48 years old, has been smoking for 15 years. The addiction is very large. Because of his weakness, he is afraid that he will not be able to bear the pain, so he thinks about quitting but fails. Later, after I used the above-mentioned body tobacco quitting method and took "Butikang" internally, the tobacco toxin was completely eliminated in no more than two months without any pain, and the body weight and physical strength were greatly increased. How to Avoid Prostate Massage Pain Physician Yao Juyan Prolonged Misdiagnosis Has the Danger of Infertility Pay Special Attention to Neurasthenia Gonorrhea prostatitis is the most common complication of gonorrhea. Its symptoms are difficulty in urination, dull pain in the perineum and anus, and sometimes swelling. In our usual treatment, there is a surgical treatment of prostate massage, but many people are nervous, and when they accidentally touch the prostate, they cry out in pain and even lose their minds. But if this disease does not undergo massage therapy, what should we do? According to my experience, if you encounter a nervous patient. You can take the German "Kelinong" internally, which can naturally be avoided, because "Kelinong" has the subtle effect of enhancing the whole body's cell anti-lin toxin and starting to eat bacteria. And it has the great effect of anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and diuretic. Therefore, "Kelinong" can be taken when suffering from prostatitis enlargement or chronic prostatitis. It</p>

<h3 id="e85">Impressions of Participating in the World Games and Traveling in Europe - A Comprehensive View of the Football Championship <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huitang (3)</p>
<p>Aside from the Japanese team's crushing 8-0 defeat to Italy, the Peru versus Austria match in the second week was also worth chronicling. After ninety minutes, the score was tied at two goals each. As usual, extra time was played, and Peru eventually scored two goals, ending the match 4-2. However, during the match, Peruvian supporters ran onto the field and assaulted Austrian players. The Austrian team management filed an appeal, accusing the Peruvian team of barbarity and intimidation, which caused their players to lose their will to fight and accept defeat. After a committee meeting, the Austrian team's appeal was upheld, and a replay was ordered. However, the Peruvian team refused the verdict, considering it unfair, and withdrew temporarily. Austria was thus resurrected from the dead and gained the semi-final spot by default. This incident was the only regrettable event in the entire championship.</p>
<p>By the third week, only Italy, Norway and Austria and Poland, strong teams, remained, and the semi-finals were about to begin. The Italy versus Norway match was held on August 10th. That day happened to be the day our football team stayed in Berlin after the tournament, so among the nearly 100,000 spectators in the stadium, there were some of us. (The first two weeks of matches were held in other venues in Berlin, and the main stadium was only used for the semi-finals.) The weather was clear and windless that day. Even if there had been wind, it probably wouldn't have blown into that iron cauldron-like stadium. The green grass on the field was like a billiard table, soft and even. The weather, the venue, the crowded spectators, the passionate cheers, and the exciting 120-minute match made people admire and celebrate. It is worth mentioning that Italy took the lead with one goal in the first half. Norway leveled the score in the second half. After ninety minutes, the score was still tied, so extra time was played. Eventually, Italy scored another goal and secured a place in the final. This Italian team, under the scrutiny of the crowd and after some warnings, played with much less brutality, which made their performance much better than when they competed against the United States in the first week. They were more focused on the ball than on the player, avoiding the fault of kicking the ball and the person. The Norwegian team also had comparable strength, with tight defense (the two teams' tactics will be described in another article). Unfortunately, their forwards were slightly weaker and could not take advantage of opportunities. Among the standout individual players, the Norwegian center-back truly had the majesty of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand men unable to cross." The Italian center-forward and left-back were also outstanding talents in the football world. In summary, that day's performance gave all parties special satisfaction. The result of that day was determined by a moment of opportunity, because their strengths were evenly matched. Whoever could seize the opportunity given by the god of fortune would have the final advantage.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 11th, our team left Berlin. We had to reluctantly miss the subsequent matches. Regretting that we didn't get to see enough, we relied on newspaper reports and eyewitness accounts from friends to learn that the three subsequent matches were also extremely intense and exciting, with each match going into extra time to decide the winner. It is said that on the day of the final, the Italian team, with the championship within reach, stirred up their ambition and reverted to their old habits of brutality. As a result, although they won the championship, they did not receive the praise and sympathy of the public.</p>
<p>After the championship, there was also a special match to determine the third and fourth places, played between the losing teams in the two semi-finals. Norway defeated Poland to take third place. Below are the dates and results of the three matches that we were unable to witness, which will serve as the conclusion to this article.</p>
<p>August 11th, Semi-final: Austria 3, Poland 1.</p>
<p>August 13th, 3rd/4th Place Match: Norway 3, Poland 2.</p>
<p>August 15th, Championship Final: Italy 2, Austria 1.</p>
<p>All matches were decided in extra time (The End)</p>
