<h3 id="c9">法郎之動態 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>數日以來法郞動搖之消息又甚囂塵上日昨電訊所傳且聞巴黎各銀行已於九日起限制金幣與外國貨幣之出售同時巴黎佈滿金禁令卽將實施及不許私人購置黃金之謠言雖銀行界重要人員尚稱政府未有放棄金本位政策之意顧事實昭示吾人法郞確已陷於極度之危機矣</p>
<p>在茲世界各國早已放棄金本位之浪潮中數年來法郞之所以獨能碩果僅存維持其原有地位而不墜者蓋有數因第一放棄金本位係經濟恐慌之結果但法國經濟恐慌產生較後而其發展亦較遲緩當一九二九年至一九三二年間激劇之經濟恐慌蔓延各資本主義國家時法國以國內矛盾較爲緩和故恐慌程度亦遠不如各國之甚直至一九三三年後法國經濟恐慌方始漸趨嚴重然迄最近以前固仍未達於最高頂點也第二戰後通貨膨脹之禍害多數人民印象尚深且法國恃金科爲生者特多而與此有關之金融資本家在政治上之勢力亦殊非小貶低幣値通貨膨脹等等顯與彼輩之利益相衝突故自必盡力保持法郞之價格第三法國與金集團諸國間之經濟關係頗爲密切且常居領導地位維持金本位制亦卽所以維持此項優勢第四英美等其自身雖已放棄金本位但雅不願法國等亦步武彼輩之後塵蓋如一旦此最後壁壘之金集團又吿崩潰則其影響整個世界經濟殊屬非淺而英美等不僅在法投資將蒙受損失卽前藉幣値較低在貿易上所獲得之相對的優勢亦必同吿消失最近英美兩國時以平準基金維持法郞價格者蓋非無因</p>
<p>雖然法郞恐終將不能堵禦恐慌浪潮之猛烈的襲擊也現時法國經濟恐慌實已由慢性而演變爲急性國內消費力量因人民之貧乏化日趨縮小物價方面不論工業生產品與農業生產品俱跌落甚劇同時生產指數亦步跌不已此外以勉强維持金本位之故國際匯兌常處被動地位對外貿易因受英美日等已貶低幣値各國之傾軋益見不利計一九三四年之入超爲四十萬一千六百萬法郞一九三五年增至八十萬一千六百萬法郞僅一年間增加幾近一倍由於以上種種之結果遂致現金源源自法流出財政赤字不斷擴大金融基礎發生破綻信用市塲亦引起絕大之恐慌最近復以歐洲局勢之緊張原本留存於法國之資金爲尋求安全出路益見加速逃亡試以前一星期爲例一星期中現金流出總數聞達十億法郞之鉅又估計本年一月一日起迄最近爲止法國各儲蓄銀行提取之欵的達六萬六千萬法郞</p>

<p>各界親愛　的同胞們、願你們來接受我們凄酸悲烈的陳詞罷、社會和環境、組成了我們今日的失業與生活的脅迫、事實大致已經很顯明的吿訴了諸君、但是失却生活完整的我們、不時運用着枯燥的腦汁、思想爭取我的生存、療冶失業的狂瀾、復興社會原來的狀態誠然、天質是給了我們剛毅的意志、廣泛的願望、可是赤手空掌的我們、雖抱着那愉快興奮的動機、却沒有起發我們智源的資力、於是鑄成了</p>

<p>— 周榕</p>
<p>前言　煤油，俗稱洋油，爲我國內地點燈照明之必需品，每年向由國外輸入，常在一萬萬元左右，漏巵之巨，殊堪驚人，查我國往昔在洋油未進口時，點燈用油，本用植物子油，如荳，蔴，棉子，花生等油是，祇以舊式油盞，墨守成規，不加改良，發光不亮，取携不便，洋油燈興起，遂遭完全淘汰，由是洋油歲入之數額，竟達入超總額五分之一，鍾靈印字機發明者鍾靈氏，有鑒及此，經數年之研究，最近有壓力油燈之創製，應用壓力原理，以植物子油，燃點燈火，光亮輕便，與市售洋油燈（卽俗稱之美孚燈無異，而安全衛生，尤有過之，現經實業部特准專利五年，並通令各省市一律提倡採用前途發展，極有希望，良以此項油燈，國產各種植物子油，均可作爲燃料，一經推銷，不唯可以塞止巨額漏巵，且揆諸供求原理，同時即可增加相等價値之農產物，裨益國計民生，誠非淺鮮，加以我國目下旣無煤油生產，一旦國際發生戰事，更有來源斷絕之　，則萬家燈火，何以爲繼，故在國防方面言，尤有重大意義，筆者因某銀行之委託，承該公司陳祖貽姚壽康兩君之邀，於五月六日前往參觀，爰將該廠內容，紀述於左，藉供關心新興國貨工業者之參考，</p>
<p>製造情形　該公司除設發行所於山東路一二八號外，另有製造廠位於華德路鴻運坊內，規模雖小，佈　整齊，其間製造程序，可分軋切，配裝，焊接，整理四步，壓力油燈之式樣（見攝影）與洋油燈不同，其最大異點，即盛油器位於燈頭之側上部，是以油面高於燈頭，此因植物油黏性（Viscousity）較大，不能如洋油之藉毛細管作用（Copillary　Phenenon）自燈芯上昇，須藉依高於燈頭之油面壓力導出之，同時爲防止燈油受壓汜溢起見，另有與入油口焊接之鐵管一技，直達器底，如是油注燈內，油面之上部與外間隔絕，壓力保持不變，迨燈芯燃點時，始徐徐下降，製造原料用馬口鐵，先經軋模機軋製油燈各部零件後，繼行配裝齊全，用鍚焊接，再加修整試騐後，即可包裝銷售，現該廠所出油燈種類頗多，質料除鐵製外，並有玻璃製數種，係由浦東代造燈罩之某玻璃廠監製，此外在華北天津老北開，並設有分廠，專製手提避風燈，不久即可上市問世，</p>
<p>營業狀况　該廠現時每日可出油燈二千盞，每盞價格自　角五分至六角五分不等，銷路以川贛陝魯等省爲最旺，據鍾君語筆者，單就川省而言，目下每月需量五萬盞，幾等該廠現有之生產量，是以日夜　工，猶　不足，綠該省洋油目漢或　運川，運費每斤達　角五分，幾超出原價二倍，而當地荳油售價，祇在二角左右，故採用壓力油燈，極爲合適，此外江西省政府熊主席，對此項油燈，提倡允力，現擬組織全省油燈運銷合作社，專辦壓力油燈之運銷事宜，又此項油燈因安令無臭，蘇錫一帶鄉間之蠶戶及製種場，亦紛紛來函定購云，</p>
<p>今後計劃　該廠除於設備方面，决定擴充，使日產可達萬盞之數額外，同時於用油問題，亦在研究之中，現擇得油量豐富培植簡易之亞膽子一種，業在浙江　屬一帶試種，佔計　本，油價每斤祇需七分左右，較荳油低廉三分之二，味苦質純，最合燈用，一俟本年試植成功後，擬向各省推行播種，如是　　　　减低，民間當更樂於採用也？</p>

<p>— （巴玲）</p>
<p>據說：五月是一個毒月，是一個不祥之月。因爲在五月之中，慘痛的紀念日，實在是太多了！若五三，五九，五卅，都不是使人覺得異常悲憤的國恥紀念日嗎？說這話的人，我們固然不能够批評他的不是：可是，言辭之間，不免有些消極頽廢的口氣，實在不是在國難如此發重的情勢之下，所應該說的話呢。</p>
<p>在我看來，悲痛的五月，我們與其說它是一個毒月，是一個不祥之月，母寗說它是一個革命之月，奮鬥之月，倒來得切實而奮發些呢？</p>
<p>我們知道，年靑人的意志，是應該奮發的，前進的。消極的觀念，頽廢的態度，不但是於事無補，而且對於自己，也是沒有什麽好處呢？我們在困苦中的生活，唯有用勇敢的，奮發的精神，才能打開一條出路。應付國難，又何嘗能逃出這種公理呢？</p>
<p>所以，悲痛的五月，雖巳到臨。同胞們實無所用其悲觀，無所用其消極，大家鼓舞着生之意志，站在一條戰線上，向着這條解救國難的大道上邁進，那才對呢。</p>

<p>— 大千</p>
<p>——今之巨無霸——</p>
<p>國伊利諾省阿耳登市有男童名勞勃脫華特羅者，現年十八歲，身長八英尺四寸半，體重三百九十五磅，實爲當今舉世第一巨童。該童父母健在　有弟兄姊妹共四人，均中等身材。該童初生時體重八磅半，亦不大異於常兒，數年後其腦底司生長機能大如核桃之分泌腺核忽異常發達，五歲時已身長五英尺餘，與通常人之身材相仿，十五歲時身長七英尺八寸半，近數年中，每年平均的增長三英寸，增重十八磅半，依此類推，二十一歲時可達九英尺餘，現時美國第一長人爲傑克歐利，係得克塞斯省厄耳帕沙市律師，身長八英尺六寸，屆時亦將瞠乎其後矣！若依男子生長時期達三十五齡計算，則該童身長可達十二英尺餘，其爲打破一切長人紀錄，可無疑也。</p>
<p>巨童旣身材長大，食量自亦倍於常人，其母常依四人之食量食之，僅早餐一次，須榖類一包，（約一磅）橘汁四分之一加侖，（約合中國一升餘）鷄蛋八枚，烤麵包十二片，蘋果汁八分之一加侖，咖啡五大杯，但巨童常有不滿之色然。某日嘗就一賣飲者沽飲咖啡，言定以飲足爲度，賣飲者充量計算，索資二角五分，（按美國咖啡通常爲五分錢一杯杯皆甚大每杯容量的當我國一中碗餘）童立卽付與之，一次連飲盡十七杯，賣飲者惟有暗自呌苦而已。</p>
<p>巨童以身長體大之故，處處感受不適，一若成人之使用幼稚園傢具者然，輾轉不得是處。出入門戶，常須低頭，已養成入屋卽屈身而行之習慣。其家庭亦常以不克應付此巨童爲苦，其允感困難者，殆爲巨童所穿之皮鞋，蓋不特尺寸須大，材料及構造允須特別堅固，吾則不足以承受三四百磅之大壓力，不旋踵卽告破裂矣。幸有一大鞋店，以好奇心之故，用作廣告宣傳，自願供給巨童之鞋，除愼選特別堅固之材料外，並加金屬綳帶，鞋之尺寸，長爲一英尺六寸半，寬一英尺，所費達二百美金，（合國幣六百餘元）可云駭人聽聞之事。牀亦特製，三年前有一牀公司以好奇心之故，自願特製一牀爲贈，計長八英尺一寸，人皆以爲必可爲該童終身使用，孰知今日巨童在牀已足不得伸矣！其家庭不得已，乃再命人特製一牀，長九英尺半，尙時懐不克供該童終身使用之懼。該童一現方自中學畢業，功課甚佳、獲得榮譽獎金、豈智慧力亦與體格成比例乎？</p>

<p>— 雷雷</p>
<p>「冰院子」是松花江附近居民，在冬春二季臨時營業的塲合，一樣的有櫃台，有招牌，有貨架，有其他一切精美的設備，所以冰院子裏的舖子，和陸上是沒有什麽兩樣的。</p>
<p>「院子」是建築在「冰」上，當松花江結成很厚的冰時，買賣的人，在泳上　挿下木柴，用溫水澆到柴和泳結合的地方，木柴便會凍在冰裏，然後再用木板攔成方格，頂上蓋着板，這樣，就成功完善的「冰院子」了。</p>
<p>冰院子做成後，做買賣的朋友，就運着各種貨物到冰院子裏來發賣，在白天冰院子裏的熱鬧和上海的城隍廟，簡直相差不遠，所以一到寒凜的冬日，「到冰院子去買××」的聲浪，就鎭日的充塞於松花江上了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　品茗作淸談夜窗聽雨　折枝驚艷影花巷流芳</p>
<p>這個時候還早，趁了天氣晴朗，先到中山家去看他一下，給他的下一句話，下午一同出去走走，下午再去的他，那就不會撲空了。心裏有了這麽一個思想，走起來只管低了頭，不免步子慢得多。好在向平山家去，倒是一倏熟路，不必怎樣留心，也不會走錯。忽然聽得一種笑語聲，是極快樂的樣子。抬頭看時，是人家白粉墻上，仲出了大半截杏花有一枝斜伸出墻來。有一個小孩子，搬了櫈子在墻邊靠着，一個伸了手去攀花枝，兩個小孩，在下面拍手笑着。國器看那樹杏花開得十分繁盛，當小孩子們這樣笑鬧着，自己也就背了兩手，站在巷子一邊看了去。就在邊個時候，却有一個學生妝扮的姑娘，在脅下夾了一個白竹布書包，由巷子那頭轉了過來。他額頭上一截溜海髮，微微的蓬鬆着。身上穿了一件細窄長到　蓋前的花格子布褂子，那一條烏光輕輕的辮子，長出了五寸黑辮子梢，在衣擺上飄曳着。在那右脇下，一排紐扣中間，掖了一條很長白色的手絹。在當時這原是一種很普通的女學生裝束。不過在這個女子身上衣那上沒有一點髒跡，沒有一點皺紋。便是他脚上穿了一雙烏絨鲇魚頭平底鞋，白色的綫襪，也是黑白分明不　一些班點。國器學校所在，本有一所女學堂，每日來來去去，也常是碰到幾位女學生。國器是一惆謹厚的少年，而且臉皮又薄，女人看到他，他先就要紅臉。所以每日看到的女學生儘管不少，但是向來沒有用過正式眼光去看他們。這時，也不知是何原故，覺得道位姑娘身上有一種吸力，吸住了自己的眼睛，敎自己不能不向他身上看了去。他是慢慢的走近前來，却是被那折花的小孩子們，把路給攔住了。他站住了脚，也揚起臉來向墻頭上看了去。國器雖是在巷子這邊，對了那牆頭，看着。但是人家揚起臉來看花，也就可以看到他的臉子。山他的身材上，國器已是吸引住了。現在再看到他的臉子，簡直把自己的靈魂給陶醉了。他是那樣白凈而又細嫩的皮膚，鵝蛋式的臉，兩隻像點漆似的眼睛，簇擁着兩圈很長的睫毛，微高的鼻子，如　的嘴唇，完全和那維納斯的偶像一樣。這簡直是自己理想中的美人，天下有這樣的鳥事，幻想眞可以成為事實的呀。眼裏望了那墻上的杏花，心裏不住的叫奇怪。那位女舉生，雖是望着杏花的，不過在偶然之間，好像是有意，也好像是無意，不斷的向國器身上打量着。</p>

<p>夜裏，是在深沉的夜裏，黑暗包圍着整個大地。高聲的建築物，睡着似的靜穆。沒有白天那麽熱鬧，很少在道垂死似的三馬路上行駛汽車，祇有昏黃的街燈和血紅的霓紅市招，在放着不同色的亮光。</p>
<p>担　飯擔子的小販和出賣靈肉的神女，在浙江路口開始活動。在這料峭的寒風裏排立着，很多的站在飢餓綫上的人團着熱騰騰的粢飯擔子。神女却懷着無可言宜的隱痛在注意每個行人，也有抓住了說着不堪入耳的括逗引這孤獨漢子。這是我每夜必然經過的地方，而必然看見這街頭的形態。</p>

<p>一個瘦長的女人，枯槁的面容，頭髮散亂得像鬼，身上的旗袍已很破舊，看去有幾個鈕子己失了效用，伊像是染有嗜好，而且食指間夾着半支捲烟，還有兩個差不多高的孩子，分立在旁邊，伊提鼻尖脆聲音歌唱的時候，這兩個孩子也跟着咿咿啞啞的唱。在烟紙店轉角的人行道上。</p>
<p>先幾天我不曾注意，只感覺得黑暗的氛圍裏激盪着尖脆的歌聲，非常的凄凉，頗能引起人的感概，後來我就注。</p>
<p>轉角上的烟紙店是通夜不息的，而且有專做夜班的人，我也時常在這店裏買紙烟，所以稍為有點熟識，於是我就借買紙烟的機會問起這歌女。</p>
<p>據他說：伊和兩個孩子來了有一星期、而且在將要天明的時候　着兩個孩子才走，伊唱了歌，並不像乞丐尾隨人後嘮嘮叨叨的要錢，而且始終不向人要錢，有時唱得疲乏，吸枝捲烟，在料峭的寒風裏不知是何意思？而且不曾見過有人給伊一個錢。</p>
<p>昨夜，尖脆的歌聲，激盪沉寂的空氣，有此凄凉，哀怨，那兩個孩子也咿咿啞啞的唱起來了！</p>
<p>也許是世界上最可憐不過的人哪！</p>

<h3 id="c152">初看蹦蹦戲 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 亦庵</p>
<p>第一次去看蹦蹦戲是在一個白天，可是白跑一躺，戲院的人吿訴我說只有星期六和星期日或其他的「封關」日才有日戲做，其餘的週日只有夜戲。於是我回來了。</p>
<p>到了星期日，我沒有把這件忘記，普天且很鄭重的又再去，因為我認為各種鄕土的戲劇都有它的價値，所以一定要去觀光觀光。</p>
<p>那一天我本不在乎要看做的是那一本戲；隨便　做的是那一本，統可以見識見識，而那天恰巧做的是潘金蓮。因為去得略為遲了，好位子買不着，只得坐到特廳的最後排而又靠旁邊的一個座位。</p>
<p>潘金蓮，在我國文學上是有地位的，等着瞧吧。</p>
<p>一會兒，鬧場鑼鼓　了，這跟京班戲的並無二致，只是我用了一面堂鼓。</p>
<p>所有的敲樂哭也與京班的相同，只是多了一個梆子，是一根硬木做的圓條子，直徑一寸多，長度五六寸，用另一根木搥來敲，聲音異常響，這是陝西梆子戲裏所特有的敲樂器。弦樂器裏除京胡外，有一個二胡，主要的是梆子胡琴。梆子胡琴形狀與二胡相似，不過音筒不是長圓形而是扁圓形的，彷彿一面小鼓，鼓面不蒙蛇皮而代以桐板（廣東的提琴筒面也是用木板的），琴桿直伸出至鼓底之下，以便操奏者用膝夾住俾按弦的手上下溜滑；因爲手指要按弦上下溜滑，所以手指的第一管節上都戴着像戒指形狀的皮套以免緊張的弦綫把手指皮割傷。這兩種樂器都是梆—戲所特有的，從前梆子戲在上海流行時，我都見過。</p>
<p>唱腔類似梆子腔，但又似乎沒有梆子腔那麽高亢慘厲，而且似乎簡單一點；有時却又夾進一些皮簧，像那天扮武松唱的就是皮簧腔；時調小曲等也很自由的　雜進去。</p>
<p>從音樂方面看來，蹦蹦戲的音樂並不怎樣高明，（但有改進的可能）。不過它有一個優點，就是當演員歌唱時，樂器是輕攏慢撚，零零碎碎有意無意地和着，所以歌唱的調句不會被吵鬧的樂器聲音掩蓋了。到了過板時，樂器才盡量放縱起來。道是値得取法的優點。</p>
<p>它把一個故事從頭至尾演完，這一點與粤劇一樣。觀衆的精神也一貫。重要的臺柱由頭塲演至末塲，也頗吃力。如果京戲可以算是短篇的話，則蹦蹦戲便是長篇了。</p>
<p>全劇歌唱的時候少，對話的時候，語音又淸楚，所以觀衆很容易懂，而且所有的對話又頗精錬。</p>
<p>白玉霜的發音眞好，伊的發音機關的共鳴率是少有的，伊只道麽輕輕的，深沉的說着，一點也不用力，臺下聽起來，覺得伊比任何一個角色的用力的說話來得淸楚，這是我從未聽過的一種聲音。</p>
<p>佈景是沒有的，臺上的道具似乎太隨便一點了。</p>

<p>— 戴院長廣播講詞</p>
<p>考試院戴院長、因奉中央派赴德國代表政府參加世界運動會、日內即將出國爲普遍宣傳政府、提倡體育之至意起見、特於八日晚八時半、在中央廣播電台向全國播音演講題、爲「救國敎育之基本原則」、茲覓誌其講詞、原文如下、</p>
<p>各位同胞今晚兄弟到中央電台來和各位講演講的題目、是「救國敎育的基本原則」、救國敎育的基本原則、是什麼呢、我們知道中國國家的衰頽民族的衰頽有幾個原因、其中的一個、就是敎育的退步、敎育的失敗、我們—總理講過革命救國的道理首先注重敎育、總理在二十幾歲的時候、曾做了一篇文章、裏面說「敎養有道、則無枉生之才、鼓勵以方、則無抑鬱之士、任使得法、則無倖進之徒」這就是說建國救國敎育爲　、所以要造成革命的大業、必要先有革命的敎育、中國過　衰頽的原因何在呢、就是中國人的身心太不健全、其由來很久、不僅最近幾百年、恐怕一千多年前、就造成了這個不良的趨勢、但是中國古代的文明、步步上進、造成世界上最光榮的文化、這又是什麽原故呢、這是因爲中國古代敎育有特別的地方、就是「術德並重文武雙修」、術是爲人處世之道、就是做人處世的方法、德就是主義、也就是道德、一個人應當有主義、　道德也應當有做人處世的方法、所以要術德並重、這是我國古代敎育特別的一點、此外一個人應常修文、也應當習武、應該文武雙修、方能使身心一切健令、這又是中國古代敎宵的特別的一點、可惜後來講主義的、不講方法、講方法的不講主義、習武的不修文、修文的不習武、於是弄得中國人的身心不健全、如同兩脚缺一、自然不能行走有學問道德的人、不講技術、不講武藝、自然不够應變中國、屢决被異族打敗、就是這個原因、所以現在要確定救國敎育的基本原則、就要恢複起古代固有的敎育原則、就是「術德並重文武雙修」、去年中國國民常五全大會的宣言中有十條綱領、一、本道德以正人心、二、興實學以奠國本、三、弘敎育以培民力」、這三條全是講敎育的、而第三條有一段「文事敎育與武事敎育應根源於同一之精神、而於國民基礎訓練、則兩者尤宜並重、以複吾國固有之良規、而應現代國家之興武敎重武德、以養成國民集團生活之習慣、健全國民身心之敎育、培養社會組織之基幹、造成國家獨立自由之實力」、第七項「推行社會敎育與成年補習敎育以敎養衛三者一貫兼修之方法、溝通政敎之關係、養成國民自救救國之能力」、槪括的說第三條、就是在「術德並重文武兼修」的原則下面、辦理敎育要把中國固有的良規、固有的好方法、好制度恢複起來、就最近幾十年的實際情形看來、實在是應該如此、只要在三十歲以上的人、就可以知道術德不並重、文武不雙修的壞處、</p>
<p>我可以舉個例子來講滿淸末葉所有的武人都不習文、帶兵的將官不讀書、兵士們不識字、這些兵士這些將官、不單對外不能保持國家的獨立、不能保持國家的利益、對內不能維持治安保護民衆的生命財產、而又到處擾民、多一兵即多一害、這就是因爲當時的兵將、雖有武敎、而無文敎、這可見滿淸末葉文武不楚修之害、後來想改革、才有軍國民敎育的實施、文學校講軍事、武學校也有學文的人去進、但是當時有許多軍人、仍然不能保衛國家、不能保護人民就是因爲當時雖然文武雙修、而術德未能並重、沒有主義、就是武力沒有基礎、有術無德、當然會產生不良結果的、</p>

<p>在皮膚上用艾燃燒。使發輕度火傷時。則該部之蛋白質凝固。破壞被吸收。此可視爲一種之異種蛋白體。當吸收時。成功刺戟療法。試以其他方法。例如用電，烙白金，灸等使皮膚火傷。或以上述方法。摘出其皮膚，筋肉等。達蛋白凝固之程度後。作成膠質。而注射之。發生與灸治極相似之症狀。</p>
<p>刺戟自律神經系統</p>
<p>艾燃燒時。因其激烈之熱。剌戟痛覺。反射的剌戟自律神經系統。尤以對交感神經爲甚。此交感神經系統之興奮。可使血管收縮，脈搏增加，血壓上昇，腸蠕動鎭靜。又自此剌載，尙可使血液之分佈狀態變動。衝動內臓之機能。使疾病受著一種影響耳。</p>
<p>促進「賀爾蒙」之產出</p>
<p>施灸時交感神經最受刺戟。於是分佈於副腎之交感神經亦亢奮。則腎上腺素之產出增加。其結果腎上腺素之生理作用。一時增大。血糖增加，脈搏增加，血管糾縮，血壓亢進，腸運動鎭靜，筋疲勞恢復等，亦多受腎上腺素之影響也。</p>
<p>血液之變化</p>
<p>白血球增加，食燼作甩增大。赤血球及血色素增加，血液凝固時間短縮，血糖增加等。對於疾病之經過。必有多少之影響。</p>
<p>與海特氏帶之關係</p>
<p>在皮膚之某一定部位。卽經穴處施灸時。與此有關之內臟。受著特殊之刺戟。較之施灸於與此全無關係之他部分。當屬有效。但亦有一部分學者。謂經穴無關者。此則尙有硏究之餘地也。</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>學齡兒意之結核問題，以Armand及Lestorduoy氏之研究，則以爲均由於家庭間的傳染，其由學校間得來者，爲例甚鮮。大概而論，則幼兒之結核死亡例甚少。結核之傳布例，多在較高之年齡，在二十五歲時，約爲六一％。</p>
<p>一九二七年Heymann氏之工作如下，此利時國之結核傳染統計，在各種不　　年齡，約如下表。（土白可林陽性反應）</p>
<p>○至一歲　不詳</p>
<p>一至五歲　三二％</p>
<p>五至十五歲　三七％</p>
<p>十五至二十歲　八五％</p>
<p>三十至六十歲　九六％</p>
<p>六十至八十歲　九八％</p>
<p>八十至九十歲　一○○％</p>
<p>以上之百分比例，乃屬於甚高者。</p>
<p>在其他各國，如意大利西班牙挪威瑞典丹麥芬蘭匈牙利諸國，僅屬於有診療所之範圍中者，始有報告，故其數甚微，不足述及。但此種報吿數，大槪均甚安全，吾人輒有一種之觀察，卽此結核之傳梁，於幼孩時代並不甚劇，輒在以後較高之年齡。Usvedt氏曾有試騐，在挪威一九一四年間，十五歲之兒童爲六七，五％，在一九三〇年間，爲四〇，五％之陽性土白可林反應，此種高峯，當然由於公共衛生之不良所致。</p>
<p>在塞耳濱波蘭俄國諸境其情形更屬不良。在波蘭，以Zelewska-Dezyna氏之傳染統計面觀，凡工人之兒童，在六歲至十二歲間者，有三八至六八％，在地位較佳之兒童，其傳染例較好，爲一九至三〇％，在塞耳濱及俄國之兒童，亦有同樣之傾向。以Jachniss氏之統計，則俄國兒童之在十四歲以下者，有六九％屬於陽性之士白可林反應。</p>
<p>尤可注意者，立道國中之兒童，在五歲以下者每一萬人中有六十三例之結核死亡者，可見其國結核傳染例之高矣</p>
<p>在美國則Dfckey氏以爲幼兒之結核傳染，比較的甚廣，但並不較成人爲多，在四歲以下之小兒，有一四，二二％之陽性土白可林反應，及三，二五之結核患者，在此患者之中，其死亡例爲四，七％。特別可以注意者，爲McCain氏對於學齡兒童之結核統計，在二萬五千零四十八個學校兒童，在十五歲以下之年齡，發現有二二，五九％之陽性土白可林反應，其中僅有一，七九％或七，六二％兒童，同時證明爲結核患者</p>
<p>黑人如印第安種之兒童，則不論土白可林之陽性反應，及證明患有結核之兒童，俱較白人爲多，爲二七，四一與三，二一％之比，二二，七與一五三％之比。又Chadwick之另一統計，在每一萬幼童中，在五歲以下者，有二〇％之被傳染者。至十五歲，則有二五％。故結梭之傳染例，美洲不若歐洲之甚。但以兩洲之大城市而論，則結核之傳染例均高。在斐拉台而非州之試騐結果，學齡兒童之在五歲間者，爲三八％，在十歲間者七一％，在十五歲間爲八一％。又Hetherington氏之觀察，以爲此種傳染，大部分由於慢性的接觸，如有開放性結核之家屬等是。若學校間之敎員及學生間之傳染，則初無甚大之關係。</p>
<p>學齡兒童之結核，及幼年兒童之結核，與軍隊間之關係十分相像。以德國而論，大學生之結核檢査非常嚴密，如明興大學學生，俱須受强迫之檢查，其年齡爲十八歲至二十五歲之間。一九二九年之强迫胸部檢查，爲三萬名學生，發現活動性開放性結核〇，四％，活動性閉鎖性結核〇，二二％，半活動性結核〇，五一％，不活動性結核Inaktiven二七，四一％，以此而觀，則活動性結核稍有增加之傾向，而各種結核之現象，亦隨年齡而增加，直至二十五歲爲止。各種早期症狀之最多數現象，爲二十二歲。此種數量，由Kayser-Petersen二氏在永納生地方之學生檢查及Wiewiorowsky氏在白來門地方之學生檢查，均有同樣之瞪明。惟在來潑齊虛地方之學生檢査，則統計之數較高，活動結核爲一，八％。但在白來斯老地方，僅有〇，六％施行檢査之聲生，則二地爲相同者。此種檢查差異之結果，由於居民之稠密度，及其環境之關係。（如爲工業區或爲農業區。）</p>

<p>（八十一）萎黃病（Chorosis）</p>
<p>什麽呌做萎黃病？</p>
<p>這是在女子春機發動期時的一種獨立貧血病。</p>
<p>女子在春機發動期時，怎樣能起萎黃病？</p>
<p>這種病的眞正原因，不很明瞭。但誘起萎黃病的事情，却很多。像不適當的坐臥生活，不良空氣中的職業（女工），缺乏日光，身心過勞（學生），精神興奮等都是。有人說，這種病和卵巢內分泌缺乏有關係。</p>
<p>患萎黃病的女子，皮膚色澤怎樣？</p>
<p>病人的皮膚和黏膜，都蒼白而帶綠色色調，面部更著明。</p>
<p>病人全身覺得怎樣？</p>
<p>全身肌肉疲勞，工作能力减退。消化器，也起障碍，食慾减退，胃酸過多；異嗜症喜歡吃酸味，白堊，炭未，壁土等。又患胃下垂症。神經系也有異狀，常訴頭痛，眩暈，嗜眠，無慾，眼花閃光，暈倒。</p>
<p>患萎黃病的女子，月經有無異狀？</p>
<p>月經不準，有時停經，有時起月經過多或月經困難。</p>
<p>其他還有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>心臟雜音，脈搏頻數，心濁音部擴大，小便稀薄，有時含蛋白質，皮膚浮腫，尤以腳踝和眼臉浮腫最著明。</p>
<p>這種病的經過，是急性或慢性，惡性或良性呢？</p>
<p>病勢經過，有急有慢；但大都爲良性，數星期到數月後，可以完全治愈。但是容易再發。</p>
<p>和萎黃病合併發生的，有那幾種病？</p>
<p>有肺癆，胃潰瘍和神經質等病合併發生的可能。</p>
<p>應該和那幾種病相區別？</p>
<p>這種病應該和初期肺癆，胃病，腎臟病，梅毒，甲狀腺中毒，症等相區別</p>
<p>治療萎黃病的時候，衛生上應當怎樣注意？</p>
<p>衛生上，最重要的是日光充分，應當遷居山間，鄉村，海濱等處。行鑛泉浴，有良效。食品，要選容易消化的植物性食品。凡葷腥油膩的東西，都要忌食。牛乳也不很合宜。最適宜的食品是蛋黃，肝臟新鮮的蔬菜，水果，　穀，等。</p>
<p>治療萎黄病，應當用什麽藥品？</p>
<p>鐵質製劑算是特效藥。砒素製劑，也好。臟器療法，是注射卵巢內分泌製劑肝臟製劑。物理療法，有炭酸泉浴，鹽泉浴，發汗法，人工太陽燈照射等。對於頭痛和胃病等，不妨各別施行對症療法。</p>

<p>（八十八）淚器的說明</p>
<p>淚器在眼科學上，亦占重要的部分。往往容易罹病。一般人常不注意及此。以致病變的所在。亦多不明瞭。茲特將牠略爲一說。</p>
<p>淚器在解剖學上，可分爲二部。卽淚腺與淚道。</p>
<p>淚腺——淚腺乃係一種管狀腺。爲排泄淚液的器官。位於眼窩上外角的淚腺窩內。是由上　　部而成　　　部是於骨　。名曰上淚腺。或稱眼窩淚腺。下部是在眼瞼後方。名曰下淚腺。或稱眼臉淚腺。兩腺各有多數的分泌管。開口於上結膜的穹窿部。淚液的分泌作用。是受顏面神經與三叉神經的主宰。常常分泌少量的淚液。因此結膜及角膜的表面。得以保持適當的濕潤。不使感受乾燥。並能藉此洗去外來的塵埃。而使眼內淸潔滑潤。但是在精神感動或三叉神經受有刺戟的時候。卽可由反射的作用。而分泌多量的淚液。所以我們在憂愁悲傷的時候。頃刻間，珠淚卽能不由自主的滾滾而下。這是一個很好的事實例子。</p>
<p>淚道——淚道是由淚點，小淚管，淚囊，及鼻淚管四部組成。</p>
<p>淚點—在內眥部的上下眼臉緣。呈灰白色。稍形隆起。中有小孔，是小淚管的開口部。</p>
<p>小淚管—上下各一。均係開口於淚囊。</p>
<p>淚囊—位於淚囊窩內。上端接小淚管。下端通鼻淚管。</p>
<p>鼻淚管—從淚囊的下端，垂直而下。開口於下鼻道。所以淚液可由小淚管吸收送入淚囊。經過鼻淚管。而排泄於鼻腔。（下鼻道。）</p>
<p>茲爲明瞭淚器部位起見。特繪一圖。以資參考。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>加熱　這是比較最靠得住的滅菌方法，在一切的傳染病都加以探用的！結核菌自不外此例。他的應用方法，是包括燒郤，熱氣，蒸氣，煮沸，四者而言；因爲同屬溫熱，其滅菌効力也大有差異的。像乾燥熱（尋常的火上加熱）的効力就不很確實，反之，如果在流動蒸氣內，則結核菌在半小時間卽可完全死滅的。詳細的說一番，他在八十五度（攝氏）高熱，祗須一分鐘時間；七十八度約二分鐘，七十三度三分鐘，七十度五分鐘，六十五度十五分鐘，以下可大致據此而等差；這一種偉大的滅菌成績，當然非尋常之乾燥熱所可彷彿的。煮沸之滅菌成績，係和蒸氣法差不多的，結核菌的死滅，也不過需時三五分鐘光景。</p>
<p>燒郤法當然是一勞永逸的方法，他比較熱氣蒸氣煮沸三種方法還來得更徹底；　是我們要曉得，除開病者之咯痰外，像病人的衣服書籍，以及一切用具，勢不能一次完全焚毀無餘、就是蒸氣煮沸法，也是難於應付的；此中的缺陷、自不能不採及天然的日光照射了！</p>
<p>利用日光之照射日光爲結核菌最大之敵人，差不多大家都知道了，他不僅直射有殺滅結核菌之効，就是經過一次反射而來者，例若通過紙窗或玻璃窗入於室內之日光，也是仍舊有効的，不過作用比較爲弱罷了。所以在光綫充足的房室，結核菌照例不能長期生存；對於本病患者之居室，當然也應該以光綫充足爲第一義，每更統開放窗戶，儘量使日光長期直射方對的。</p>
<p>日光殺滅結核菌之力量，也是以痰層之厚薄而稍分彼此的：尋常直射日光之殺滅結核菌，大槪需時一至三小時，對於厚層之咯痰，則無論日光如何强烈，至少非二十小時不行。日間光錢也屬結核菌敵人之一，但發生滅菌的效用，至少非數天不成功，幷且作用也不狠確實，當然不能和日光並論了！</p>

<p>世態炎凉，古人往往發生感歎的，但是到了現在，炎凉的程度，比較從前亦非常的進步，無論古今中外，在種族間，或社會上，天天演着這樣一幕的戲劇，故人原是一種勢利動物，欺騙動物，殘忍動物，假定看破了這樣一幕戲劇，而不去加入串演，這人便會被人呌做傻子。</p>
<p>不信請看耶魯撒冷七日電訊，阿王定於明日自海法港到達此間，當局不擬舉行任何儀式，英國高級委員華嘉普爵土，刻正視察埃及雪那意本島，亦不到塲歡迎，這爲的是什麽？因爲現在的阿王，已非從前在阿比西尼亞執政的阿王，已做了亡國的阿王，權勢沒有了，地位失去了，還要歡迎他做甚麽？假令阿王仍舊是一位獨立國的君主，偶然到耶魯撒冷去遊玩，我不知阿王在該地要受當局怎樣的歡迎，怎樣的敬禮？卽使英國華嘉普爵士，亦一定特地到場參加盛典，這原也不必怪該地當局，也不必怪英國的華嘉普爵士，這就呌做世態呌做炎凉的世態。</p>
<p>這樣，阿王原不必牢騷，不必憤激，世界原是這麽一回事，歷史上因爲這樣事情，而發過牢騷的，不勝枚舉，第一要怪阿，干自己不好，不能保守疆土，無力抵抗帝國主義的强暴侵略，幷且人非但是炎凉動物，而亦是一種最殘忍的動物，非但在戰爭的時候，殺人不眨眼，果然不算，就是平日一舉一動，無一而不帶殘酷性的，例如阿王此决率同卷屬隨從，由束非法屬吉蒲堤港，乘坐英國巡船，轉赴耶魯撒冷城，經過埃及之賽特港，義國王太子妃，乘坐義國醫院船凱撒號，亦經此返國，義國僑民，均持旗在埠頭歡送，迨阿王之船經過本港，先後相距不及數小時，埠頭上義國國旗，猶未撤去，阿王在甲板上遙望義國國旗飛揚，不禁凄然，我不知義國王太子妃，何以不先不後，也在此時乘輪返國，是偶然的呢？還是故意也在此時返國，搖武揚威，以刺激阿王的心靈呢？此種慘痛的現象，試問阿王怎樣難受呢？亡國之君，旣經如此難過，若亡國之民，還要受怎樣的痛楚呢？</p>

<p>朱七猴子把個粗而短的勃子往後使勁兒一挺，只聽得，「可……撲！」的一聲，於是乎一口黏痰就「瓜兒」的一下子落到毛毛爹的臉上了。接着他就搶起了老虎拳把桌子打得「帮！帮！」的呌起來了「你媽的，你說什麽？憑良心？……你還想坑我嗎？你……不要臉的！像你這樣的混賬忘八蛋，眞可稱得起蓋世無雙，蓋世無……」</p>
<p>「可是……可是——」</p>
<p>「可是個鷄巴蛋，可是……。我朱七猴子不能不算厚道，喂，喂！呌你自己說，呵？你不是會憑良心嗎？你就憑憑這個良心……怎麼着？你耳朶裏堆上驢毛了嗎？你媽的！……</p>
<p>「朱七爺你也犯不着……」</p>
<p>「犯不着，媽的什麽犯不着！簡直是在這裏放狗屁啦，你！」</p>
<p>「俺借你底錢，可不是白借的呵，每月五分半利呵，是不是？朱七爺！……」「好哇，你放的屁很不錯呵！——可是我問你，這半年來你交我一個子兒來嗎？呵？你媽的還口齒牙硬，好了！今天要連本帶利的還不上那就是亂子，吿訴你！」</p>
<p>這裏毛毛爹着慌了，「連本帶利，」連本帶利要一百八十塊錢哩，這往什麽地方去討換呵，他急的哭了，他拭着淚，（趁勢把那口痰也拭掉了）他想到唯一的辦法還是哀求，於是他撲登的一下子跪下了：</p>
<p>「七爺，好心的爺！老天保佑多子多孫的七爺呵！求求你，……</p>
<p>「我沒有這麽些好哇！我根本就不憑良心！</p>
<p>「不，不！七爺，我才眞不憑良心哩，我！……借了你老人家的錢不還，還惹得你生氣，該打，該！……」毛毛爹一把鼻涕一把淚的哭訴着，自己劈劈拍拍的打着嘴巴！「求求你老人家開恩，再寬限我幾個月吧，……兒子死了，只靠着一個老婆，一個女兒能做些什麽呵，你老人家是好心的。……」</p>
<p>「媽的，看你剛才那股子牛勁兒，我眞要沒頭沒臉的榛你一頓，你曉得嗎？……哼！要不是看着你這麽大年紀。管許呌你吃不了的兜着走！」</p>
<p>「是的，是的！……」</p>
<p>「媽的，錢什麽時候還得上呢，說？」</p>
<p>「哼，這個……」</p>
<p>「我倒給你想好了辦法啦，你媽的……來呵！」</p>
<p>「是呵！」裏邊有三十人答應了。</p>
<p>沒多少時候，那個劉師爺鬼頭鬼腦的來了，手裏拿着張紙頭，他嘻皮笑臉的遞給了朱七猴子，那個接過來看了一遍，以後向毛毛爹說：</p>
<p>「喂！我看哪……今天你也交不上的，哼！我再限你兩月，怎麽樣呢？」</p>
<p>「那太好了，兩個月我拚上命也要還上這個賬，七爺你眞是太好了，多福多壽的……」</p>
<p>「媽的，別鳥囉嗦！這是一張字據，就是說再限你兩個月的意思呵！你再這裏劃個押吧！」</p>
<p>「劃個押？……」</p>
<p>「老混蛋，劃個十字好了！劉師爺說：</p>
<p>「噢！懂得懂得，……於是他左手拿起枝筆由下往上，由右往左的在字據上劃了個歪歪扭扭的十字，他看着劃的不好，要再劃的直些，劉師爺就把筆來奪過去了，墨就留他底兩個指頭上。</p>
<p>「鳥囉嗦，……滾吧！」</p>
<p>毛毛爹就磕了幾個響頭，威激零涕的退出去了，他聽見朱七猴子和劉帥爺哈哈的笑了。</p>
<p>在毛毛爹滿意的回家吿訴了她們母女倆之后的第二天，朱七猴子，劉師爺連帶着好多人和警察到他家去了，朱七猴子拿着那張他劃過十字的字據，一見面，朱七猴子就揍了毛毛爹幾個耳光，駡道：</p>
<p>「你這混賬忘八蛋，人呢？趕快交出來！」</p>
<p>「什麽人呵？七爺……」</p>
<p>拍！拍！拍！耳光又響了。</p>
<p>「你不是寫了字據了嗎，你還劃了十字！」朱七猴子一回頭，把手一擺，七八個大漢就一聲呼哨闖進內屋把毛毛搶出來，七手八脚的綁起來，扛着走了</p>

<h3 id="c205">獅子 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>大槪是爲了有人把中國自比爲獅子之故吧，我對獅子很抱了好感。</p>
<p>最先是在書本子上看到，說什麽獅子一吼，別的野獸便躱得無影無踪。我的確感到獅子的偉大。</p>
<p>之後，是在稱爲野獸片的影片上看到，看到獅子和老虎之類猛鬥，心裏也感到不少興奮，好像我就是獅子似的。</p>
<p>這時候，便漸漸地有人稱中國爲「睡獅」了。「睡獅」，那也不要緊，睡而已，等他醒過來它是依舊會吼，依舊會跟老虎之類肉搏的。</p>
<p>但這時候我看到了馬戲。看到了馬戲之後，我對獅子也就失去了偉大的印象，因爲它會屈服于馬戲者的鞭子下。</p>
<p>不過大槪由于過去對它的好感太深，所以雖然不免對它屈服于鞭子下而做戲感到有些屈辱，然而還不免有痴想，以爲屈服祇是暫時的，一旦它覺醒過來，不僅鞭子將無用，卽使是那執着鞭子的馬戲者，也將被它吞下去。</p>
<p>結果自然是失望。獅子還是乖乖的在鞭子下做戲。</p>
<p>自此以後，我又在動物園看到獅子。最初看到它的時候，因爲剛從山裏捉來，所以頗有野心，在鐵籠子裏不住的來往奔跑，見到了人就吼了起來，甚至還撲到鐵柵子前；這時候我對它又恢復了好感，以爲它雖然被關於鐵柵裏面，但要是有人胆敢走過去，那毫無疑意將會被它噬死的。</p>
<p>最近我又去了一次，恰巧逢到它在喫牛肉，喫完了，很舒適的伸伸腰，便躺在水門汀地上用舌子擦着水門汀，人走近它它好像沒見到似的。</p>
<p>外面看的人看到它懶洋洋的神氣，於是用各種聲音去嚇它，甚至還有人用東西去擲它的。但是它祇是懶洋洋地欠一欠身，踱了幾步，讓得遠些又躺下。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>鐵籠子外的聲音還是依然，用東西擲它的也依然，並且好像擲得更兇似的</p>
<p>這一次，它站了起來，我想，現在總該撲過來了，然而並不，它祇是吼了一聲，便躱到草堆裏去了。</p>
<p>當我離開它的時候，心裏想着：這樣的獅子離死的日子總該不遠了吧？被各種聲音威嚇，挑撥，被各種東西擲它，也該侮辱死了。雖然它有養它的人給它牛肉喫。</p>
<p>不過我又繼而一想：這頭獅子是不能代表獅子的全體的。</p>
<h3 id="c206">蠻荒之旅 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 莊瑞源</p>
<p>越過一支亞熱帶長葉林的小巒，透過粗大的樹葉樹幹，迢遙的行車道在蠻荒的原野上展開了患黃疸病的身子，迢遙地伸到沒有涯涘的蠻荒地帶裏。</p>
<p>在原野上，伸到如此遼遠的盡頭的行車道，患黃疸病的身子瘦長得比一頭死蛇。</p>
<p>沿路疎朗地生長着高大的杉木，像單零的人那麼孤寂地殘存着。在大太陽炎荒的辣熱底下，原野是荒曠的，杉木也蒼老了，這光景是棧石星飯的古道呢。</p>
<p>征服這蠻荒的旅途，我們是坐在一輛窳敗的摩托車中，兩條腿兒疼痛地擱在鐵箱子上，一頂闊緣的遮陽草帽便代替了柳枝給當作我們的車蓬。</p>
<p>這是辣熱的夏季的一天，臉上掛下來的汗水，一沾在衣服上，擴散了一片水濕的印漬。</p>
<p>窳敗的摩托車像一匹疲乏的拐馬，儘開足了奔馳的速度，却還是牛車那麽笨重地顚簸着，輾轉着。車頭嗤嗤地噴吐一口口的水氣和水沫，喘息着，吃力得像在攀越山巒。車頭裏的水快吿罄了吧。</p>
<p>平坦的行車道，征服却還是那麽地困難呵！</p>
<p>倘着汗水，人感到累啦。敗車比人更累，像牛拉的那麽地顚簸着，長征者的汗在輪底輾吐着。</p>
<p>初次的人不自在地眷戀着扔在後邊的家，辦憂着躺在前端的路，而且又是單身的年輕人呢。</p>
<p>出門人是不能拿日子計算歸程的。</p>
<p>送着我的伴侶，時常對我作着父執似的絮語的，是一個和藹的老傭人。他送我走到一個偏僻的渡頭，從那裏我得登上那到更遠更遠的地方去的大海船。</p>
<p>這一切在我都是陌生的，沒有熟稔的人，熟稔的家！</p>
<p>「年輕的人離開了家便有一種危險。這世界是建造在泥潭裏邊的。在外邊的日子不比是在家裏，千萬當心人們的種種奸詭的相態呵！」</p>
<h3 id="c207">牛鼻子　没有題目 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 黄堯</p>
<p>他又這麽地對我說，幷且吿訴我他過去的事蹟。</p>
<p>而他告訴得最多的是趕程的故事。這在蠻荒的地域裏，是另有一番年輕人所不知道的况味的。</p>
<p>「甚至走着這麽平坦的路，也是不容易的呵！</p>
<p>「等到路走得長久了，漸漸地老練起來的時候，你知道繞折，迂　，和怎麽避開崎嶇的途徑；可是，人是走近了路的盡頭，而感受可怕的疲累了。」</p>
<p>我緘默着。爲着他的年紀，我記住他的話。他曾在旅途上磨折他的一段生命。</p>
<p>敗車像牛拉的那麽地顛簸着，長逾上的壯者的汗在輪底輾吐着。車頭嗤嗤地噴吐一口口的水氣和沫，喘息着，吃力得像在攀越山巒。倘着汗水，人感到累啦！</p>

<p>顧而巳杜小鵑趙丹葉露茜唐納藍蘋三對藝人，在六和塔結婚以後，回上海來又借靑年會九樓，歡宴至親好友，到二三百人，眞是一個偉大熱閙的羣衆塲面，自始至終喜氣洋溢，沒有一個不呵呵而笑，其中最有趣的是當顧而已站起來演講的時候戴了一頂便帽，大家高聲喊叫，要顧而巳把帽子脫下，不明白的人本來在懐疑，顧而巳爲什麽連這一些規矩都不懂，顧而巳黨下就請大家靜一靜，他哀求似的說：「我實在脫不得帽兒啊！」說時遲，旁邊站着的金山的手却是快得很，不待顧而已提防，立刻將顧而已的便帽搶下，這時給大家瞧到的，是顧而已的一個中間一方沒有頭髮的頭，他慌張得手足無措，連忙用手掩住了這個怪頭，逃進後邊去，套上了一頂法蘭西帽再出來，說了幾句話後這頂法蘭西帽又給「司儀先生」施超搶下，顧而已祗好再捧着頭躱進去。</p>

<p>這裏，我們又得附帶報吿一個好消息：也許可你們都已經久仰了的那個「化裝大王」辛漢文先生也加入了新華公司。顧而道還老年人以及這個禿頂的化裝都出於辛大王的神技，非但在銀幕上你們是萬萬看不出顧而巳是一個二十二歲歲的小伙子，還多少可以相信化裝在國產電影裏也從此有了較高的技術了！</p>

On the morning of the 12th, the general assembly will discuss proposals from the Civil Affairs Group, and in the afternoon, it will continue the general assembly to discuss proposals from the Civil Affairs and Public Security Groups. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Attendees of the local senior administrative personnel meeting all participated in the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 11th, so no group meetings were held in the morning. At 11:00 AM, President Chiang summoned the Civil and Education Ministers of ten provinces at his residence, inquiring in detail about the recent handling of civil and education administration in each province. The ministers gave detailed reports. Chiang also gave instructions on advancing civil and education policies in the future. After an hour, the entire group departed and attended an internal banquet. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the Civil Affairs, Education, and Public Security Groups held separate meetings, chaired by Chiang Tingfu, Weng Wenhao, and Duan Xipeng, respectively. The Civil Affairs Group discussed in detail issues such as the joint office of the provincial government and the streamlining of provincial government organizations, the powers of supervisory commissioners and their concurrent service as county magistrates, the abolition of bureaus and the establishment of sections in county governments, and local finance. The ministers and commissioners also detailed the current difficulties in implementing policies and the financial constraints. The Education Group discussed the promotion of free education, the implementation plan for education, the promotion of productive education, and the development of health education, promising to carefully design and consider both funding and teacher resources, aiming to improve the quality first, and then gradually promote the quantity. A general decision has been made at the meeting. The Public Security Group discussed the promotion of the Baojia system, the police system, and the security team, first by having the attendees report on the results and difficulties in handling these matters, and then deciding on solutions, and conducting thorough research to improve the public security system. Proposals from the Civil Affairs and Education Groups will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion on the 12th, and proposals from the Public Security Group will be submitted to the general assembly for discussion on the 13th.

At 6:00 PM on the evening of the 11th, a banquet was hosted by the Ministry of Military Affairs. On the 12th, the general assembly will be held in the morning and afternoon to make concrete decisions on the proposals of the Civil Affairs and Education Groups and implement them effectively.

<p>(Nanjing) After the National Congress in November, all political affairs will conclude.

The central government had previously instructed local party personnel to assist local governments in urging the people to accelerate the process together. Recently, party personnel have been dispatched to various provinces to provide practical guidance and promote the central work of autonomy. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Central Memorial Weeks: Sun Ke Reports on the Revision Process of the Draft Constitution; Chairman Lin Speaks on the Importance of Thrift <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held its 23rd Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 11th, attended by Vice Chairman Chiang and Central Committee members Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Fang Juehui, Yu Youren, Zhu Jiahua, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Gongbo, He Yingqin, Zhou Qigang, Yang Yongtai, Zhang Qun, Ma Chaojun, Huang Shaoxiong, Liu Zhenhua, and others, as well as all staff members, totaling over 700 people.

(11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 11th, attended by Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan, Jing Tingyi, Chen Shuren, Xiong Shihui, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Wei Huai, and others, as well as officials from the National Government and various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, and the directors and commissioners attending the local senior administrative personnel meeting, totaling over 600 people. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he delivered a speech on "The Importance of Thrift." The ceremony concluded at 10:30 AM. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin spoke on "The Importance of Thrift" at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 11th, stating in essence: "To alleviate China's poverty, in addition to actively developing industry, we must promptly correct the bad habit of waste. The only way to correct this bad habit is to practice thrift. Thrift is a virtue in our country. For thousands of years, it has been vigorously promoted by sages and has deeply penetrated the hearts of society. Although other countries also value this virtue, they do not match our country in depth and universality. Therefore, promoting thrift now is not a forced imposition, but rather a restoration of this inherent virtue. Our party has always valued this virtue. Thrift was one of the seven movements stipulated by the central government in the 17th year, and in recent years, simplicity has been stipulated as one of our guiding principles for life. Civil servants, standing in a position of leading the people, should set an example and practice what they preach, ensuring that their daily food, clothing, housing, and transportation all deeply comply with this principle, to advocate for society and transform social customs. They should also pay attention to handling public affairs for the country, be mindful of the country's material difficulties, and take care to protect public funds and property, and not use public office for private gain."

<p>Customs Says Smuggled Goods Entering Tianjin Have Decreased in the Last Two Weeks; Xiao Xichao Inspects Hangu and Tanggu Salt Flats Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Robert Liskey, Tax Commissioner of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the General Inspectorate of Customs, went to Qinhuangdao on the 9th to investigate smuggling, and returned to Tianjin on the night of the 10th, immediately transferring to Qingdao for inspection. Customs, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, has begun to consult with the Beining Railway and Jinpu Railway to discuss further effective anti-smuggling measures, and to change the previous anti-smuggling agreement. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Xichao went to Hangu and Tanggu on the morning of the 11th to inspect the salt flats, and returned to Tianjin in the evening, planning to return south by night train, bringing the agreed-upon measures for anti-smuggling in North China to the ministry for review and approval. According to Customs sources, although there have been multiple cases of smuggled goods entering Tianjin in the past two weeks, they are indeed somewhat less than in February and March. The reasons are: 1. There is a surplus of smuggled goods, and sales are stagnant. 2. Re-exporting is not easy, and tariff revenues from January to the present have decreased by half compared to the same period last year. However, the past has all been slow months, and the peak months are beginning in the future. If effective anti-smuggling measures are taken, it should be possible to recover the losses. Many smuggled goods are transported from Dalian, because since 1905, Dalian has been designated as a free zone, and all goods entering the zone are exempt from taxes. The system still exists today. Smuggled goods can enter the port and then be transported to our territory by steamships and civilian ships. At present, it is difficult to develop concrete anti-smuggling measures in the short term, and it is also difficult to obtain good strategies in eastern Hebei. The relaxed assistance of transportation agencies also has its own difficulties. The Customs is currently discussing reliable measures. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Customs previously detained five smuggling ships at Qikou. The Japanese consul, Nagai, asked Customs to return them, but this was refused. However, fines will be paid. Tianjin Customs and Zhifu Customs are now using seven gunboats, including Haiyan, to patrol the waters off Zhifu. Upon receiving a report, they should quickly intercept smuggling ships. Recently, the smuggling trend in Qikou has disappeared. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway, due to the excessive amount of smuggled goods transported from eastern Hebei, which were piled up at the East Station, occupying the freight yard and hindering railway transportation, specially announced nine regulations on the 11th to limit the occupation of freight positions. Each merchant is only allowed to rent two freight positions. The shipping bill will only be issued upon arrival at the station. Those who exceed 24 hours will be charged a rental fee. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons today paid attention to the smuggling in North China. Conservative MP Charles Royden asked the British authorities what steps they would take regarding Japanese goods transported from Dalian through the autonomous region of eastern Hebei to China, in order to protect British business in North China. Prime Minister Baldwin replied that the British authorities are actively discussing with the Japanese government in order to protect British interests. Royden also mentioned the Tanggu Agreement, saying that this agreement does not allow more than two Chinese customs patrol boats to enter within three miles of the coast, resulting in rampant smuggling. The Prime Minister replied that he was unaware of this restriction. The British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, has informed the Japanese government of the difficulties faced by the Chinese authorities in dealing with the smuggling problem in North China.

<p>(Taiyuan) Guan Linzheng arrived in Bing by Tongpu train from Linfen at 4:00 PM this afternoon, staying at the Zhengda Hotel. Zhao Daiwen and Yang Aiyuan, along with other military and political figures from your office, went to the station to welcome him. Guan told reporters that his division entered Shanxi on the 6th of last month to suppress bandits, and after repeated battles along the Tongpu Railway, the bandits in western Shanxi suffered extremely heavy losses from our various encirclements and suppressions. They have now completely crossed the river, and the remaining bandits are being cleared and searched by our various armies. His division is currently stationed in Xixian.

<h3 id="e8">Ministry of Finance Drafts New Regulations to Encourage Exports of Machine-Made Goods; The Original Customs Warehouse System Will Still Exist; Separate Regulations for Customs Warehouses for Manufactured Goods Will Be Formulated <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance's policy of encouraging the export of machine-made goods used a tax refund method before 1930. All raw materials were subject to import duties, and when the manufactured goods were exported, the merchants were refunded the original import duties. After the customs system was revised in 1930, a customs warehouse method was used. All imported raw materials were first stored in customs warehouses. When merchants needed them, they applied to the customs to pay the import duties. If they did not need to re-export them, they did not need to go through the process of paying and refunding taxes. Recently, in order to revitalize the market and facilitate merchants, in addition to the original customs warehouse system still existing, separate regulations for customs warehouses for manufactured goods have been formulated. This method is still new in our country. The main points are: all machine-made factories that purchase raw materials from foreign countries may first store them in customs warehouses, and submit a request to the customs, explaining the type of manufacturing and the need to transport them for export. After verification and permission by the customs, the customs will send personnel to supervise, allowing merchants to transport raw materials to the factory for manufacturing without paying customs duties, and then export and sell them. However, at least two-thirds must be for export and sale. If a portion is sold domestically, import duties will still be levied. However, factories that request this must be deemed by the customs to be properly managed and located, and have complete facilities, in order to enjoy this right. The new regulations are currently being drafted by the Customs Department and submitted to the Ministry. They will be implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Our country has always used the method of refunding raw materials for export goods made from imported raw materials to provide encouragement. Since the autonomy of customs duties, the customs warehouse method has been adopted. The Shanghai Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Association stated that after the implementation of the customs warehouse method, taking rayon silk products as an example, exports in 1933 were 5 million yuan, but decreased to 1.5 million yuan in 1935, and have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting relief. The Ministry of Finance believes that our country's policy of encouraging export goods made from imported raw materials has always used the method of refunding raw material taxes or establishing bonded factories and warehouses. However, the refund of raw material taxes is difficult to accurately calculate the raw materials and finished products, and it seems unnecessary to adopt it again. In order to facilitate industry and commerce and revitalize the market, it was decided to adopt the method of establishing bonded factories and warehouses. Currently, the Ministry of Finance is drafting regulations on customs warehouses for manufactured goods based on the principles of the above-mentioned methods, and is submitting them to the Executive Yuan for record, and at the same time ordering the General Taxation Department to implement them on a trial basis. The important contents of the regulations are threefold: 1. The location of the customs warehouse must be in a location deemed appropriate by the customs for easy management and audit. 2. The manufacturing products must be mainly transported and sold overseas, and must account for at least two-fifths of the quantity of products in order to be exempt from import duties on raw materials. Otherwise, they will still be subject to import duties. 3. A guarantee must be provided for the establishment of such a customs warehouse to prevent the purchase and use of smuggled raw materials, and the clandestine sale of manufactured goods inland. This method can not only help industry and commerce to compete in foreign markets, but also strictly manage them and prevent abuses. Taking rayon manufactured products as an example, they have always been mostly based on domestic raw materials. If rayon manufactured products can increase their export volume due to this method, then egg silk or cotton yarn can also be exported accordingly, which can also help develop domestic exports. The method of establishing customs warehouses for manufactured goods will be implemented on a trial basis in the customs first. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Dynamics of the French Franc <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The news of the French franc's instability has been rampant again in recent days. Yesterday's telegrams reported that banks in Paris had begun to restrict the sale of gold coins and foreign currencies since the 9th. At the same time, rumors of a gold ban and the prohibition of private individuals from purchasing gold were spreading. Although important bank officials still claimed that the government had no intention of abandoning the gold standard, the facts showed that the French franc had indeed fallen into extreme crisis.</p>
<p>In the current wave of countries abandoning the gold standard, the reason why the French franc has been able to remain intact for several years, maintaining its original position without falling, is due to several factors. First, abandoning the gold standard is the result of economic panic, but economic panic in France occurred later and its development was slower. When the acute economic panic spread to various capitalist countries from 1929 to 1932, France had relatively moderate domestic contradictions, so the degree of panic was far less than in other countries. It was not until after 1933 that the economic panic in France gradually became serious, but until recently, it still had not reached its peak. Second, the majority of the people still had a deep impression of the disaster of post-war inflation, and there were many people in France who lived by gold. Financial capitalists related to this had considerable political influence. Devaluing the currency, inflation, etc. clearly conflicted with their interests, so they would inevitably do their best to maintain the value of the French franc. Third, the economic relationship between France and the countries in the gold bloc was quite close, and France often held a leading position. Maintaining the gold standard was also a way to maintain this advantage. Fourth, although countries such as Britain and the United States had abandoned the gold standard, they were unwilling for France, etc. to follow in their footsteps. If this last bastion of the gold bloc collapsed, its impact on the entire world economy would be significant, and not only would British and American investments in France suffer losses, but the relative advantages gained in trade by lowering the currency value would also disappear. Recently, Britain and the United States have used equalization funds to maintain the price of the French franc, and this is not without reason.</p>
<p>However, the French franc will eventually be unable to resist the fierce attack of the panic wave. The economic panic in France has now evolved from chronic to acute. Domestic consumption power is shrinking due to the impoverishment of the people, and prices of both industrial and agricultural products have fallen sharply. At the same time, production indices are also falling. In addition, due to the forced maintenance of the gold standard, international exchange rates are often in a passive position, and foreign trade is becoming increasingly unfavorable due to the competition from countries that have devalued their currencies, such as Britain, the United States, and Japan. The trade deficit in 1934 was 401.6 million francs, which increased to 801.6 million francs in 1935, an increase of nearly double in just one year. As a result of the above, cash has been flowing out of France and the fiscal deficit has been continuously expanding, leading to cracks in the financial foundation and causing great panic in the credit market. Recently, with the tension in the European situation, funds originally stored in France have been seeking safe havens, and their escape has accelerated. Taking the previous week as an example, the total amount of cash outflow in one week was said to be as high as 1 billion francs. It is also estimated that from January 1st of this year to the present, the withdrawals from savings banks in France have reached 66 million francs.</p>
<p>In short, the current crisis of the French franc is the same as the British pound, Japanese yen, and US dollar a few years ago, an inevitable result of the development of capitalist economic panic. The artificial struggles of the French authorities and the assistance of British and American equalization funds can only support it temporarily.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) One-third of the special parliamentary session has passed. The questioning war between the various factions of the House of Representatives regarding the government's administration is gradually revealing its sharp edge. The atmosphere in the parliament under martial law is becoming increasingly tense. As of today, the compromises of the various political parties have been relatively satisfactory. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties, because they have representatives participating in the government cabinet, lack fighting spirit, but the conduct of deliberations and other matters can be said to be effective. As for the government, it declared after the February 26th incident that all affairs would be renewed, but in the parliament, the old state of affairs is still exposed. Even though Army Minister Terauchi implemented a determination to purify the army, which met the expectations of the people, the policies and program announced by the government at the time of the cabinet formation did not show any concrete expression or preparation in the parliament. The replies of the government officials regarding the stability of the people's lives, the solution of rural problems, the correction of economic institutions, the reform of administrative organizations, and the reform of the education system lacked concreteness and practicality, causing great disappointment to the people. (11th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of military personnel participating in politics became a problem during the Okada Cabinet. Army Minister Hayashi and Navy Minister Osumi, representing the military, expressed their beliefs, stating that military personnel should not participate in politics. However, from the viewpoint of broad national defense, they studied political and economic issues, and did not conflict with the Meiji Emperor. The Meiji Emperor granted the Imperial Rescript to Military Personnel on January 4, 1882, clearly expressing the limits of participation in political issues. Army Minister Terauchi also expressed his views on this issue in the current resolution meeting. Military political opinions should be expressed through the Army Minister. Therefore, active military personnel are prohibited from expressing opinions on political issues through petitions, suggestions, or public statements in speeches or articles. Army Minister Terauchi's statement is a general principle about military personnel not participating in politics. However, from the viewpoint of broad national defense, the military is conducting fundamental research on politics, economics, industry, and society, and the military's attitude is particularly cautious to avoid causing problems of interfering in politics. However, the general public also believes that the military's expression of political opinions on urgent national defense issues in the parliament is participation in politics. The military authorities regret this, and are also dissatisfied with the Army Minister's attitude in his replies. Therefore, there are currently opinions within the army that the authorities should clearly express their views on the relationship between military personnel and politics, which is absolutely urgent.

<h3 id="e11">Japanese House of Representatives Discusses Guaranteeing Human Rights; Minister of Justice Promises to Improve the Judicial System <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 9:11 AM on the 11th. Mr. Kinui Hiroo (Seiyūkai) spoke first, saying that the parliament discusses the issue of human rights violations every year. Is this not due to defects in the law? What specific measures does the Minister of Justice have regarding this? Minister of Justice Hayashi replied that regarding the issue of improving the judicial system, the Judicial System Investigation Committee is currently conducting investigations and research. Without reaching more advanced research, concrete measures cannot be decided.</p>
<p>Kinui vigorously spoke about improving the treatment of judicial officials and then advocated for the amendment of current laws, saying that the judicial authorities, based on current laws, treat detainees harshly, with no respect for human rights.</p>
<p>The Minister of Justice also acknowledged this fact and vowed to improve it in the future. Furthermore, because current laws are excessively difficult to understand, both the officials who apply the laws and the people subject to these laws feel uncomfortable. Therefore, this issue needs thorough consideration. Kinui also debated with the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Home Affairs on the issues of amending the election law and the lawyer law.</p>
<p>Mr. Ketsune Yama Satoshi (Social Democratic Party) questioned the fundamental policy of the current cabinet regarding stabilizing people's lives and said that the special parliamentary session was too short. Mr. Kamei Kanchiro (Social Democratic Party) also expressed sympathy and requested Prime Minister Hirota to extend the session. The Prime Minister only said he hoped the committee would cooperate. Ketsune also mentioned the Prime Minister's previous response that Labor Day was an imitation of the West and requested the Prime Minister to correct this statement. However, the Prime Minister refused, saying that from the perspective of Japan's national circumstances, there was no need for correction. Minister of Home Affairs Shio also ignored him. Ketsune further spoke about the necessity of sweeping away unsettling social thoughts, providing relief to economic poverty, and allowing for independent national development. After requesting the Prime Minister's agreement, he debated the issue of the incompleteness of social policies with Minister of Home Affairs Shio and requested the Minister of Home Affairs to amend the Labor Dispute Mediation Law. He also vigorously spoke to Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa about the urgent need to provide relief to small and medium-sized business owners. Minister of Home Affairs Shio and Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa both replied that the government was studying this issue. Their responses were evasive.</p>
<p>Mr. Kazami Akira criticized the Prime Minister for the opposition party's lack of understanding of the Hirota cabinet, then shifted the topic and questioned matters such as the revision of the pension law, reducing electricity rates, and increasing tobacco prices. Government committee members did not give definite answers to these questions. Kazami attacked the government's inaction and lack of policies, then shifted the topic again, reciting the reasoning behind Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa's judgment. He questioned the government, saying that military purification could not be carried out without relieving the panic in rural villages. The Minister of the Army replied that they were working to stabilize rural and fishing villages. Prime Minister Hirota stated that he had no intention of convening an extraordinary parliamentary session. Kazami then strengthened his tone, saying that the current cabinet's understanding was completely empty and merely the existence of a leisured class. Kamei Kanchiro of the Social Democratic Party also spoke, saying that the Prime Minister's claim that the opposition party lacked understanding was inappropriate in constitutional governance and should be retracted immediately. However, because the Prime Minister refused to retract his statement, the parliament suddenly became tense. Uehara Etsujiro requested Committee Member Kawasaki to mediate. Kawasaki requested the government's good offices. Kazami then stopped questioning, and the Speaker announced a recess. (11th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives convened at 1:12 PM today, and immediately presented the Silkworm Cocoon Handling Control Bill. Committee Chairman Shimada explained the reasons for the proposal, and then Shimizu Ruzaburo, Hirano Rikizo, Yamazaki Shoji, and others raised questions, believing that the bill was insufficient as a countermeasure for rural villages. After Committee Chairman Shimada's response, it was submitted to the committee. Mr. Ogawa, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, explained the reasons for the proposal regarding the Important Industries Control Law Amendment Bill, and then Mr. Oyama Kuranosuke took the stage to ask questions. The Minister of Commerce and Industry gave a simple response. Then, Mr. Katayama Tetsushi of the Proletarian Party asked questions, believing that this bill guarantees capital profits, reduces labor wages, and increases the prices of products, hindering the interests of consumers. It is a bad bill that can only promote the unity of large capital and has no controlling power. The fundamental facilities of important industries must be developed by the state. What does the authorities think? Regarding the state-run operation of the above-mentioned important industries, the Minister of Commerce and Industry regarded it as a new type of question and only replied that there were many valuable opinions, making it inconvenient to answer. Mr. Katayama felt regret, so he submitted the bill to the committee. The Commercial and Industrial Union Central Treasury Law Bill was proposed. After Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa explained the reasons for the proposal, Mr. Maeda Kosaku, a neutralist member, rose to ask questions. Halfway through, he suddenly proposed an emergency motion, saying, why didn't former Prime Minister Okada commit suicide to take responsibility? This remark was sudden, causing the parliament to be extremely embarrassed, so he was stopped from speaking. Mr. Maeda was still stubborn and unwilling to obey, so the Speaker had no choice but to order him to leave the parliament. At that time, he was carried out by guards. Then, Mr. Mizutani Chozaburo of the Proletarian Party asked questions, pointing out the defects of the bill. Then, the Minister of Commerce and Industry and the Vice-Minister of Finance gave detailed answers and submitted it to the committee. Later, there were the Automobile Manufacturing Business Law Bill, the Northeast Revitalization Related Law Bill, and the Local Railway Related Law Bill, all of which were submitted to the committee. The meeting adjourned at 5:39 PM. (11th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers convened at 10:30 AM on the 11th, with Count Matsudaira as chairman. The Post-Martial Law Approval Request was proposed. After Committee Chairman Inoue reported on the progress of the committee's deliberations, questioning began. Mr. Sakatani Yoshiro said that the authorities failed to prevent the February 26th Incident in advance, and their responsibility was extremely serious. After the incident, the Minister of Home Affairs should have immediately entered the palace to serve the Emperor's wisdom and carry out appropriate measures to avoid mistakes. In the current state, there is no necessity to implement martial law. Please give a clear answer. Minister of the Army Terauchi and Minister of Justice Hayashi gave simple answers to this. The Bank Law Amendment Law and other bills were proposed. The committee chairman reported that the original plan was entirely approved. Then, Otsuka Yui Sei Dengzeng said that Japanese people in the Philippines have worked hard for thirty-four years and obtained land. However, the Philippine Islands exclude Japanese people and plan to seize the land, which is a regrettable matter for Japan-Philippines friendship. (11th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Terauchi replied in parliament that to strengthen the army's national defense plan and to prepare the army to cope with the situation in the Far East, with the aim of strengthening military preparedness, plans to increase the garrison in Manchuria and expand aviation facilities, etc., will be submitted first in the budget for the Showa 12th year. The Army's central department, because its opinion is consistent with the Kwantung Army, is currently developing a specific plan and will begin negotiations with the government authorities after the special parliamentary session ends. It is said that the Army's plan will be implemented continuously for three or four years, so the costs related to Manchuria after next year will inevitably increase. (11th, Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The foreign authorities of the 18 countries gathered here to attend this afternoon's League of Nations Administrative Council meeting exchanged opinions this morning. It seems that all want to handle the matter cautiously and avoid hasty discussions that could endanger the foundation of the League of Nations. The Administrative Council is scheduled to meet at 5:00 PM. The current difficult problem is whether to deal with the Italian-Abyssinian issue immediately or postpone it to await a special meeting to be held in mid-June. The Italian representative earnestly stated that Rome ordered the word "annexation" to be carefully avoided, which is a diplomatic advantage that can be used as the basis for negotiations between various national capitals. The Italians here all say that they do not reject cooperation with the League of Nations and expect that the Italian representative Aloisi will not oppose the Administrative Council's adjournment, even at the cost of continuing sanctions. (11th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) It is generally expected that at today's League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, the discussion of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute will be postponed until mid-June, implying non-recognition of Italy's claims on Abyssinia. This resolution also contains the intention to continue implementing sanctions against Italy. Britain also does not want to take unilateral action and withdraw from the League of Nations. (10th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Spain met for two days and have now resolved that Abyssinia should remain a member of the League of Nations and that its representatives should still attend the Administrative Council meeting, and there will be no changes due to Italy's annexation. It is expected that when the League of Nations Administrative Council meets on Monday, the anti-Italian attitude of various countries will become more resolute. (10th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian Minister to France, Walde, arrived here this morning from Jerusalem. When the League of Nations Administrative Council meets this afternoon, it will invite Walde and the Italian representative to attend the meeting at the same time. Political figures here are deeply afraid that the Italian representative will oppose this move, inevitably causing disputes. In order to quell the matter, the Administrative Council may adopt the following procedure: After the Italian Chief Representative Aloisi protests against Walde's attendance, several other country representatives will respond and explain that the Abyssinian representative's attendance at the meeting is legally sound. This protest and response should be recorded in the minutes, and then the Administrative Council will decide to postpone the entire Italian-Abyssinian dispute until the Administrative Council holds an extraordinary meeting in June. (11th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the League of Nations Administrative Council are now mostly in favor of postponing the discussion. The reason they cite is that the new French House of Representatives will not convene until the 2nd of next month, and the French government is not convenient to take important decisions before the House of Representatives convenes, so it is better to postpone the discussion.

<p>(Geneva) The Italian representative, Aloisi, recently declared that as long as the Abyssinian representative exists in the League of Nations, Italy will refuse to attend the Administrative Council. (11th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, Scialoja, recently submitted a note on his country's annexation of Abyssinia to the League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. Avenol immediately informed him that only the Administrative Council had the power to consider this matter. Aloisi, the chief secretary of the Italian Prime Minister's Office, met with Avenol tonight to discuss the procedures for tomorrow's Administrative Council meeting. (10th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council has now decided to meet at 5:00 PM tomorrow. First, the notification of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia will be brought up for discussion. At that time, the Abyssinian representative Walde will be invited to attend the meeting and be on an equal footing with Italy. Regarding this level, the Italian representative Aloisi will certainly object to Walde's attendance on the grounds that Abyssinia no longer exists and will argue about whether to stay or leave. According to the original plan, the Administrative Council was scheduled to meet at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning, but representatives from various countries anticipated that Italy would take this action, so it was changed to an afternoon meeting in order to consider the situation in advance and avoid disputes from occurring temporarily.

<p>(Geneva) Italian sources recently declared that if the League of Nations Administrative Council decides to postpone the discussion of the Italian-Abyssinian issue at its meeting this afternoon, so as to postpone it until the Administrative Council convenes an extraordinary meeting in June, then the Italian Chief Representative Aloisi will not object. As for the current sanctions, Aloisi will also not demand their abolition.

<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Ambassador Sugimura stationed in Italy today, the Italian government has decided to annex the territory of Abyssinia to the Italian Empire and will make a final decision and issue a supreme order. The issue here is Japan's relationship with Abyssinia. The Italian government has repeatedly stated that it will maintain Japan's rights and interests in Abyssinia, and regardless of any new situation that may occur in Abyssinia's political structure, the Italian government should naturally acknowledge its promises. In order to ensure Japan's existing rights and interests based on the reality of the situation, it should be expected to have no regrets. This is the fundamental attitude of the Japanese government. Whether the Italian government's decision is deemed admissible should be considered a formal issue, and the second step should be to determine its measures. (11th, Domei)</p>

It is said that Badoglio thanked Baudat because on the night the Emperor left Addis Ababa, the Abyssinian authorities handed over all Italian prisoners to the French Embassy for protection, so they were not killed by the rebel soldiers. When Badoglio later spoke with the French Embassy staff, he said, "The Abyssinian army fought bravely against our invincible army, and their courage is admirable." (11th, Havas)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Emperor of Abyssinia telegraphed the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, from Jerusalem yesterday, stating, "The strength of Italy and Abyssinia is vastly different, and the course of the war has been cruel and inhumane, defying justice and being rare in modern times. I have now decided to end the war and travel abroad, firstly to avoid the suffering of the people, and secondly, although I live abroad, I can continue to strive for the independence and sovereignty of my country for thousands of years, as well as the principle of collective security threatened by Italy, and do my best.

Regarding the new situation in the Italian-Abyssinian issue, that is, the consequences that may arise from Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, most countries now advocate temporarily refraining from thorough discussions. According to reliable sources, Britain is now trying to limit the current research to the procedure of discussion. If a dispute arises due to the attendance of the Abyssinian representative, this Administrative Council may simply postpone the Italian-Abyssinian issue to an extraordinary meeting in mid-June for discussion. As for the current sanctions, they should still be maintained until mid-June, when they will be studied again.

It is said that the result of the meeting of the seven countries yesterday is that the effectiveness of Articles 11 and 19 of the League of Nations Covenant should be strengthened to prevent future international disputes. Article 11 states, "It is hereby declared that any war or threat of war, whether directly or indirectly affecting any member of the League of Nations, is a matter of concern to the entire League of Nations. The League of Nations shall endeavor to save it in order to maintain peace among nations. If any member of the League of Nations requests, the Secretary-General shall immediately convene the Administrative Council." It is also declared that any situation affecting international relations that is sufficient to disturb international peace or endanger the good understanding on which international peace depends, any member of the League of Nations has the right to bring to the attention of the League of Nations General Assembly or the Administrative Council in the name of friendship. Article 19 states that the League of Nations General Assembly may at any time request member states to review already inapplicable articles and consider international situations that may endanger world peace.

It is said that the Italian King will go to Abyssinia to inspect the area when it is peaceful in a few days. The King has now assumed the title of Emperor of Abyssinia, while Mussolini will not visit the area because the trip requires passing through Egypt, and Mussolini has always had the ambition to never visit foreign countries. At the same time, the Italian armies on the north and south routes of Abyssinia have joined forces in Dire Dawa. The Italian army has now occupied all the main points along the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway.

Well-informed observers here also believe that although Mussolini has stated that he respects British interests in Lake Tana, this is not worth taking seriously, because the annexation of Abyssinia is a threat to Britain's security, dignity, and future. (National News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, all newspapers unanimously opposed Mussolini's announcement of the annexation of Abyssinia. The only supporter was the Daily Mail, which stated that the British government had various reasons to recognize the annexation with a spirit of non-jealousy. The Morning Post, however, stated that this was an act of victory in a drunken stupor, and not an act of statesmanship. Mussolini has thrown the last chance of reconciliation into the sea, and has added an insult with excessive calculation to the signatory countries of the 1906 treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations. The Daily Telegraph also stated that the League of Nations cannot be dismissed by a Roman gesture. The future destiny of Abyssinia can only be finally decided by a solution agreed upon by all countries. The Daily News pointed out that Mussolini's declaration was the final challenge to the League of Nations, and a final warning that Mussolini's ambitions have not yet disappeared. The News Chronicle stated that Mussolini's actions, like a flash of lightning, show the world we strive to reach, in which he moves by usurping the power of others. The only hope of avoiding this lies in reaffirming the principles violated by Mussolini through action. The Times' editorial column alone did not mention the issue of the annexation of Abyssinia.

The Emperor fell ill while having breakfast, and the physician of Sir Arthur Wauchope, the High Commissioner for Palestine, immediately diagnosed him with a nervous breakdown. Last night, a wireless radio was installed in the Emperor's room to allow him to listen to Mussolini's declaration of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia.

<p>(Paris) Léon Blum, the leader of the Socialist Party in the Chamber of Deputies, announced today that he will form a government on June 2nd, with stabilizing French finances as one of the most important points of his political program. Blum, who has been publicly recognized as the leader of the Popular Front, gave a speech at the National Socialist Party Congress today, announcing his political and financial policies. Although he only briefly outlined the general principles, he reiterated the Socialist Party's opposition to the devaluation of the franc, and clearly attacked the general forces demanding devaluation, calling these speculators traitors to the interests of France. Regarding foreign policy, Blum announced four principles: Support the League of Nations, consolidate European peace, promote mutual assistance pacts, and advocate disarmament. He also said, "We must unite to resist the attacks of the Fascists, and we must ensure that the senior organs of the government have the spirit of the Republic, and eliminate all secret propaganda of the Fascist Party." (National News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the Orthodox Socialist Party today, the party leader and future Prime Minister Léon Blum delivered a speech, stating: "The future cabinet is a cabinet for the happiness of the public. France seems to have suffered from anemia, with numbness all over the body, and its confidence has disappeared. It is up to the future cabinet to bring France out of its illness and into the realm of health. Given the current situation, no matter which party forms the cabinet, it will encounter various difficulties. How can the cabinet formed by the Popular Front be an exception? We hate the policy of franc devaluation as much as ever, and those who sell short and speculate are waiting for the opportunity to take advantage of the situation and wait for the arrival of the devaluation period. This kind of trick has been around for a long time and is still happening today. It is inevitable that there will be speculative behavior on exchange rates during the general election of the Chamber of Deputies, regardless of which faction wins the election. France has been suffering from poverty for a long time. Like a human body with thousands of sores and wounds, it has not yet recovered to health, and the pain it feels will naturally increase. What we should focus on is active creation and encouragement, not passive prohibition and destructive behavior. Since the economic depression and the decline of all industries, the wages earned by workers have not been enough to make ends meet, and talented young people have become unemployed. All kinds of predicaments cannot be described in detail. We now want to make the general public feel interested in work again, and redevelop the country's resources, so that the concept of security can be restored, and the happiness of the people can be increased. If possible, we will do our best to achieve this. We are willing to restore the balance of the budget, so as to stabilize the finances, because a sound financial situation is essential for any country. All of the above are within our expectations. However, some people may still say that we will throw France into the abyss of turmoil and chaos. Is what they say credible? Our cause, if we want to succeed, must be based on a true sense of trust. This sense of trust cannot be exchanged for money. It is a sense of trust in the country itself. The people of our country, with their diligence and wisdom, have been passed down from generation to generation. As long as they get up and work, they will be able to produce results and bring the country to the realm of innovation. This sense of trust is what our country wants to restore. From this point of view, our cause is practical and realistic, and is exactly the opposite of those who engage in destruction. How can it be said that this is a fair assessment?" Léon Blum mentioned the Socialist Party's policy of forming a cabinet, saying that it should promote the passage of the National Economic Equipment Plan by the National Assembly to help economic recovery. "We have no intention of retribution against anyone." On the contrary, all those who are hesitant, worried, and wander down the wrong path should be united, because if these people are not successful, they will be used by those who advocate autocratic regimes. The lessons from other countries are not far away, so how can we not be cautious? In short, our cause will not only be the victory of socialism, but also the victory of national sovereignty. We should show the masses practical results, so that they can be convinced from the bottom of their hearts. This should not be forgotten for a moment. However, this is a major event, and it cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. Therefore, we must seek to be in power for a long time, but to achieve this goal, we must quickly achieve results to comfort the expectations of the people. The future of the Socialist Party and the future of the French Republic will be determined by our future political achievements." In conclusion, he said, "In our future struggle, there should be one leader to lead us. I say this, not without a hint of autocracy. Since I was born, I have never spoken in this tone, but the current situation is very different from the past. Even my personal thoughts and feelings have changed with the times. Why do I say this? I know very well that you have complete faith in me. I am not presumptuous, and I can bear it without shame. Therefore, I accept it with a sigh. In the future, in order to live up to the price of admiration, I will naturally use all my perseverance, courage, and loyalty to serve the cause. We must now be bold and careful, so that liberalism can overcome fascism, and social justice can overcome injustice." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

At noon, the price softened slightly due to a large number of sales in Europe. The opinion of people in London is that the remarks of anyone, no matter how powerful and enthusiastic they may be, cannot stabilize the market unless the confidence of the people has been restored, and there is no sign of the restoration of public confidence at this time.

<p>London The leakage of the budget plan to increase income tax and tea tax before its announcement, which caused the public and tea industry people to rush to insure in time, has been started in court today for investigation. The chairman is Judge Porter, and Attorney General Sir Somerville made a speech at the opening, saying that there were many who insured against the increase in income tax and tea tax, but before the budget announcement, newspapers speculated. There are all kinds of people who insure against tax increases, and many of them have not been realized. The contents of the budget, in early April, senior officials and confidential shorthand writers were very likely to know. Now, according to the transactions made by the insurance industry, the first transaction was made on April 14, handled by Mr. Batters. There are also three transactions ordered by the son of the Minister for the Colonies, Thomas. He is a partner in the Birisha Securities Brokerage. Mr. Batters has always had transactions with the firm. Mr. Batters is an old friend of the Thomas father and son. According to the Thomas father and son and Mr. Batters, they met during Easter week, and they never talked about the budget at that time, and the colonial minister did not leak anything. They are all willing to assist the court in investigating from where the leak came. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

At Batters' request, he contacted the insurance brokers to negotiate the insurance premium for the income tax changes. Later, he made an insurance transaction of 4,000 pounds on behalf of Batters. He now knows that Batters has also insured elsewhere. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Zhejiang Donation and Tax Supervision Committee stated that in recent times, there are numerous new policies, and funds are often lacking. Therefore, local governments have set up various names to levy taxes on the people, not in the name of donations, but in the name of "so-and-so expenses," so that they are not subject to legal restrictions. If this trend continues, the people will be unable to bear it. Recently, they have specially requested the Executive Yuan to interpret this. The Executive Yuan believes that the fees collected by local governments for starting a business are in fact no different from donations and taxes, and cannot be exempted from legal restrictions simply because they avoid the name.

<h3 id="e76">Yan Xishan Reports on the Suppression of Communist Bandits, Requests Merit Awards for Outstanding Generals, and Simultaneously Blames Himself <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan News: The Communist bandits in western Shanxi have recently been routed towards northern Shaanxi by a general offensive from various armies. The military affairs of bandit suppression in Shanxi will soon come to an end. Yan of Shanxi received an order from Chairman Chiang to draw a large army from the bandit suppression forces in Shanxi to pursue and suppress the bandits across the river, striving for a fundamental annihilation so as not to leave hidden dangers for northern Shaanxi. After receiving the order, Yan not only ordered the armies to quickly clear the bandit areas in western Shanxi, but also ordered the Tongpu Railway Headquarters to completely repair the railway from Pingyao to Fenyang within ten days for military transport. Furthermore, he ordered the military ferries or docks from Fenyang to the Yellow River port in western Shanxi to be quickly surveyed and rushed to repair. The headquarters has urgently transferred employees from various units and recruited local laborers to rush repairs day and night in order to complete the work on schedule. Once this road is repaired, the armies from both the north and south of Shanxi Province can transfer cars via the Tongpu Railway and go directly to northern Shaanxi. Thereafter, the mobilization of troops will be even faster. As the bandit disaster in Shanxi is about to be quelled, Yan telegraphed Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang today (6th) to report on the military operations of bandit suppression in Shanxi Province and to request punishment. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yan Xishan's Telegram to Lin and Chiang:</p>
<p>To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission: The Shanxi-Suiyuan Army has a total of eight divisions and three brigades, and the number of soldiers is indeed not small. However, due to environmental factors, two divisions are stationed in Suiyuan, one division and one brigade are stationed in northern Shanxi, one division each is stationed in southern Shanxi and Luzhou, and one brigade is stationed in the provincial capital. Since the Communist bandits occupied northern Shaanxi, I was ordered to send divisions and brigades to defend the river. Besides the army responsible for the river defense, there were only one division and two brigades left in western Shanxi, and only one division was responsible for the river defense. With the strength of one division, it is responsible for the defense of more than a thousand miles. Each crossing point can only deploy one platoon of soldiers, and the strength is indeed extremely thin. On February (day), a large part of the bandit army forcibly crossed the river from Zhongyang and Shilu counties, numbering more than 20,000. Upon hearing the report, Xishan quickly mobilized troops stationed in various places day and night to suppress the bandits, while simultaneously requesting the central government to send a large army to Shanxi to assist in the suppression. The bandit's initial intention was to break through Fenyang Xiaoyi and go straight to Taiyuan. Yang Xiaoou, Commander of the Second Column, killed more than 3,000 bandits at Yantou Zhongjiashan in Xiaoyi on March (10th), with even more wounded. The bandit's momentum was greatly frustrated, so they disintegrated and fled in four directions. One route fled north to Jiaocheng Wenshui and the Ai Lan Jing area, and at Luoyukou in Xing County, they connected with Liu Zidan's bandits, numbering several thousand, and crossed east. Troops were sent to intercept and attack them separately. Subsequently, Regiment Commander Zhang Zhengyu engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in the Jijiayuan area of Lishi County, catching the bandits by surprise with a night attack, severely wounding the bandit leader Liu Zidan. He died in Yongping Town. According to a telegram from Division Commander Gao Guizi, the bandit leader's body was indeed transported to Wayaobao on April (27th), and a memorial service was held on (28th). The large bandit crowd still fled back to the Xixian and Fenxi area. The bandits who fled south besieged cities and robbed merchants and civilians along the way through Lingshi Huozhou Hongtong Linfen Xiangling Fencheng Xinjiang and other counties. The Third Column Commander Tang Enbo, the Fifth Column Commander Guan Linzheng, and the First Column Commander Yang Chengyuan surrounded and suppressed the bandits in three routes. Unable to withstand the attack, the bandits retreated to between Daning Yonghe and Xixian, and more than a thousand people crossed over from Qingshui Pass, attempting to collude and flee east in a large scale. On the second day of April, Guan Linzheng led his troops to intercept the bandits head-on in the Yucheng area between Xixian and Daning, engaging in fierce battles with the bandits for days, capturing a thousand bandits and killing many. On the 30th, he inflicted heavy damage on the bandits in the Zhangjiayuan Diaojiayu area of Xixian, and the attempt to flee east was stopped. According to statistics, the number of bandit troops who crossed the river successively was about 30,000 or more. The armies fought dozens of large and small battles with the bandits, and more than half of the bandits were killed or wounded. The bandit's momentum became increasingly unsustainable. When the bandits on the north and south routes fled back to Xixian Fenxi Daning Yonghe and other counties, Xishan divided the area into layers of pillboxes, gradually compressing them, and aiming to encircle them in the smallest area, concentrating and annihilating them. However, the Yellow River defense line stretches for hundreds of miles north and south, and it is necessary to be thorough. The army of encircling bandits and building pillboxes still felt that there were not enough troops to be distributed, and the important crossings were mostly within the bandit army's sphere of influence, so heavy troops could not be stationed at the beginning. Later, when most of the bandits under the command of bandit leader Lin Biao and others moved west, our army could not bypass and go west, and the small river defense troops were also attacked from the front and back. The armies on the west bank were also unable to help due to the rugged roads and transportation difficulties. According to reports from the front, the remnants of the bandits had crossed the river from Yujiazui Qingshui Pass in Yonghe County and fled back on the Dongjiang and other days. At present, there are no large bandit traces in Shanxi, and we are planning to dispatch troops across the river to track and suppress them. The above is the general situation of bandit suppression in the past two months. I am a clumsy person, entrusted with a heavy responsibility. I failed to prevent the bandits from coming east beforehand. After they fled to Shanxi, I was deeply afraid that they would disturb Henan and Hebei, and increase the disputes. I spared no effort to sacrifice the local area and tried my best to annihilate them in Shanxi, so as to relieve the central government's worries about the north. However, due to improper deployment, they were able to cause disturbances in various counties, almost one-third of the province, and the people were displaced and suffered unspeakable pain. Fortunately, the central government promptly dispatched a large army day and night, and Chairman Jiang directed the strategy of suppression. Chief Commander Chen Cheng was loyal, diligent, and practical, and his command and dispatch were appropriate. Commander Guan Linzheng, Commander Yang Xiaoou, and Regiment Commander Zhang Zhengyu were able to fight bravely and fearlessly, leading their troops to fight bravely, either greatly frustrating the bandits' atmosphere or killing the bandit leader. They are all exceptionally outstanding and should be given awards to encourage them. I have failed in my duties, unable to prevent the bandits from coming east, and unable to stop them from fleeing west. I have failed the country above and the people below. I should be dismissed from my post and ordered to be severely punished by the authorities to warn future generations. In addition to ordering the handling of aftermath, settling refugees, eradicating remnants, and strengthening political work, another article will be reported separately. I respectfully telegraph to you, hoping for your consideration. Taiyuan Pacification Director Yan Xishan kowtows with the fish seal.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Ministry of Industries Joins Five Provinces to Establish a Tung Oil Manufacturing Factory; Raising 2 Million Yuan to Establish Factories for Unified Control of Transportation and Sales; Zhejiang's Tung Oil Production in 36 Counties Totals 200,000 Loads <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Tung oil is a major export of our country and a special product of Zhejiang Province. The southeastern part of the province is mostly mountainous, and the soil and climate are extremely suitable for planting tung trees. Therefore, the yield of tung seeds is quite abundant, and the oil quality is also good. However, due to the fact that land resources have not been fully utilized, production is not improved, and there is still a lack of good methods for marketing, the annual tung oil production and export statistics are still ranked fourth compared with the southwestern provinces. If we do not actively find ways to improve, the international sales will follow the footsteps of the silk and tea industry and gradually decline. The construction authorities, in view of this, have ordered all tung-producing counties to conduct a province-wide survey of tung oil production and sales in order to plan for improvement in an overall way.</p>
<p>Tung Producing Areas Are Severely Affected by Insect Pests</p>
<p>Now, according to the reports of various counties and the collection of other relevant materials, the tung producing areas include Fen Shui, Lanxi, Songyang, Qingyuan, Jingning, Shouchang, Yongkang, Longyou, Jinhua, Suian, Jiangshan, Lishui, Yiwu, Changhua, Xuanping, Wuyi, Dangshan, Xianju, Yuqian, Jinyun, Chunan, Longquan, Pujiang, Qu County, Tonglu, Yongjia, Qingtian, Tangxi, Yunhe, Xinchang, Xiaofeng, Huangyan, Taishun, Dongyang, and other twenty-six counties, distributed in the Jin Qu Yan Wen Chu areas. The annual tung oil production is between 150,000 and 200,000 loads. There are two varieties: one-year tung and multi-year tung. The insect pest is mostly the looper, which is very harmful. Cultivators mostly let it grow naturally and do not pay much attention to cultivation, so the Construction Department pays close attention to tung oil insect pests and has ordered the Provincial Entomology Bureau to find ways to prevent and control them in order to increase production.</p>
<p>Circulation and Transportation Suffer Layer Upon Layer of Exploitation</p>
<p>In terms of oil pressing methods and tools, stone rollers, stone piles, and wooden steamers and wooden presses are mostly used. In terms of power, human, animal, and water power are used. The tung seed oil yield is about 40%. The general situation of transportation and sales is that farmers sell the tung seeds they produce to oil mills, which sell the oil after pressing to local oil shops, which transport and sell to oil shops in other places, which then sell to foreign firms, which then transport and sell to foreign countries. In this process, there are also intermediaries such as small tung seed and tung oil vendors, brokers, and transit agents. The transportation steps are very complicated, and there is also a pre-sale system, which is commonly called "tung seed batch" or "tung oil batch." Farmers presell their products at low prices before harvest, and the exploitation they suffer is even worse. Tung oil quality can be divided into five types: first oil, second oil, third oil, mixed oil, and miscellaneous oil. First oil is the oil pressed out for the first time, also known as raw oil, which is light in color and clear and of the best quality. Second oil is the oil pressed out for the second time, also known as cooked oil, which is red in color and also of good quality. Third oil is the oil pressed out for the third time, which is of lower quality. Mixed oil is a mixture of two or more types of oil, and miscellaneous oil is mixed with other impurities such as clear oil in mixed oil. In terms of selling price, according to last year's situation, the local oil price was 16 to 20 yuan per load, and the transportation and sales to oil shops in other places was about 25 yuan, and then sold to Shanghai shops for about 30 yuan. Sales locations are Lanxi, Jinhua, Qu County, Yongjia, Ningbo, Hangzhou, and other places in the province. Most of those outside the province are concentrated in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Five Provinces Join Hands to Establish an Oil Refining Plant</p>
<p>In recent years, the international market has a great need for tung oil, resulting in soaring prices, and it ranks first in the country's export sales. However, due to the fact that general speculators often take the opportunity to raise oil prices and arbitrarily manipulate the market, and the quality of tung oil is not very pure due to poor manufacturing methods, it must go through foreign merchants' re-refining procedures before being transported and exported, making it easy to be monopolized by others. The Ministry of Industries believes that this matter is of great importance to international trade and plans to jointly establish a factory for refining by the five tung-producing provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi. Yesterday, Zhang Jiazhu, Director of the International Trade Bureau, was specially dispatched to Zhejiang to meet with Wu Tingyang, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, to conduct preliminary consultations. It is reported that the plan is for the five provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi to each raise 300,000 yuan, for a total of 1.5 million yuan, and the Ministry of Industries to raise another 500,000 yuan, for a total of 2 million yuan. Funds will be used to purchase new-style machinery to establish a large-scale oil refinery in Shanghai. Domestic export tung oil must be refined by the factory, and it is also planned to control transportation and sales in a unified way, so that the quality of tung oil is pure, the prices are uniform, and it is easy for foreign countries to purchase it, thereby increasing the status of international trade. If the provinces have insufficient funds, they can consider inviting merchants to invest. After the share capital is raised, a shareholders' meeting will be convened, and the Ministry of Industries and the five provinces will jointly organize a foreign trade company organization to determine the factory site and actively prepare for construction.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Large-Scale Construction Underway in Guangdong Province: Issuance of Four Types of Public Bonds Planned; Air Defense and Rural Bonds Scheduled for July 1st; Construction Bonds for Sales on May 15th; Silkworm and Silk Industry Bonds Issuance Regulations Currently Being Drafted <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong provincial authorities are determined to reorganize and develop military and political affairs, vigorously promote construction, and implement the first three-year plan. Various departments are diligently implementing it according to the schedule, and considerable achievements have already been made. The second three-year plan is currently being drafted. The authorities are even more determined to carry out urgently needed industrial construction on a large scale, aiming to attend to both aspects and proceed simultaneously. Matters such as provincial air defense facilities, the development and continued establishment of various factories, the development and relief of provincial water conservancy and rural areas, and the maintenance and development of the silkworm, silk weaving, and cotton yarn industries have all been decided to be handled by the respective competent authorities. However, due to the urgent need to resolve funding issues, it is proposed to issue public bonds. The current progress of the four types of public bonds being prepared for issuance is summarized below:</p>
<p>Air Defense Bonds</p>
<p>The air defense public bonds, resolved to be issued by the Provincial Assembly, amount to ten million yuan. Since being submitted to the Provincial Government for review and implementation, they were first reviewed by the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments. Together with their opinions, they were submitted to the Provincial Government, which then approved them at the Provincial Affairs Conference and forwarded them to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for record. This public bond has been renamed "Air Defense Bonds." The face value and issuance amount will remain as originally planned, with only slight changes to the issuance methods. Detailed implementation rules for the issuance methods are being drafted and will be announced to the public. The Provincial Assembly and the Finance Department are currently handling the printing of these bonds. Once printing is completed, the President and Vice-President of the Provincial Assembly will sign them, and then the issuance will begin on a scheduled date, aiming for June, with the issuance date tentatively set for July 1st. This is because July of this year marks the beginning of the second three-year plan and the start of the 25th year. The timing of the issuance of these bonds will not affect the progress of air defense facilities in the province. According to the bond issuance regulations, a loan of ten million yuan can be obtained from the Provincial Bank in advance, and then repaid in installments to the Provincial Bank after the bonds are issued. Secondly, air defense taxes have already been collected for half a month starting in April. These revenues can also be gradually submitted to the headquarters and transferred to the competent authorities for air defense facilities. Therefore, the issuance of air defense bonds will only begin after careful planning is completed.</p>
<p>Rural Bonds</p>
<p>This bond, originally named "Guangdong Water Conservancy Public Bonds," has a total amount of ten million yuan, with seven million yuan used for provincial water conservancy construction and three million yuan used for the relief of the silkworm, silk weaving, and cotton industries. The issuance of water conservancy public bonds is based on the five million yuan rural construction plan passed by the Guangdong Political Affairs Joint Conference and the construction of dike public bonds reported by the Central District Pacification Headquarters for the construction of tidal field dikes. The Provincial Government approved the merger and instructed the Finance and Construction Departments to draft issuance methods and report back to the Provincial Government. The Provincial Government, considering that tidal field construction, water conservancy development, etc., are all part of rural construction, specifically renamed it "Rural Construction Bonds." This bond is designated to be handled by the Water Conservancy Committee. Due to the decision to issue it in advance, the issuance is temporarily set at seven million yuan. The issuance regulations have been jointly submitted by the Finance and Construction Departments to the Provincial Government for review and approval. They were forwarded to the members of the Water Conservancy Committee for review and revision yesterday. If they are deemed appropriate, the Provincial Government will instruct the Finance Department and the Water Conservancy Committee to plan the issuance, with the issuance period also set during the second three-year plan of the 25th year.</p>
<p>Construction Bonds</p>
<p>The five million yuan construction public bonds, issued according to the needs of developing provincial-run major factories, had issuance regulations drafted by the Provincial Government last year and were originally approved by the Central Government. However, due to unsuccessful negotiations for collateral loans, the issuance was temporarily suspended. However, the authorities believe that the provincial-run major factories that have already started operations are thriving, with considerable annual profits, which can be used to repay loans in installments. Those that have not yet started or are in preparation urgently need large sums of money to continue construction. Therefore, for the sake of expanding and developing various factories, it was decided to issue and promote sales on its own in Guangdong. The Provincial Affairs Conference decided that sales would begin on May 15th. According to news from the Provincial Government, the total amount of these public bonds is five million yuan, and they are solely managed by the Construction Investment Department. The Chairman of the Provincial Government, Lin Yunkai, and the Director of the Construction Department, He Qifeng, have already signed and sealed them. All of them will be transferred to the Provincial Bank and Guangdong Industrial Bank on time for issuance. It is reported that when these bonds were printed and transported to Guangdong, the Provincial Government initially instructed the Finance Department to send personnel to count and temporarily store them. Later, the Provincial Government transferred these bonds to the Municipal Bank for safekeeping. Now, the Construction Department is solely responsible for handling them.</p>
<p>Silkworm and Silk Industry Bonds</p>
<p>The Provincial Government is preparing to issue seven million yuan of rural construction bonds, designating their use for the construction of tidal field dikes and the development of water conservancy. Outsiders, unaware of this, may think that the relief and maintenance of the silkworm, silk weaving, and cotton industries are being neglected, or that the five million yuan construction public bonds issued by the Provincial Government are intended to revitalize the silkworm, silk weaving, and cotton industries. However, this is not the case. According to investigations, the Provincial Government originally planned to issue ten million yuan of construction water conservancy public bonds, with nine million yuan used for the construction of dikes and two million yuan used for water conservancy. One million yuan each was designated for the revitalization of the silkworm, silk weaving, and cotton industries, totaling ten million yuan. Later, the authorities considered that the construction of dikes and the development of water conservancy both belong to rural construction, so it was renamed "Rural Construction Bonds." The total amount of the bonds was set at seven million yuan, and they are issued through public subscription. Therefore, the silkworm and other industry revitalization public bonds will be handled separately by the Construction Department. The purpose of these public bonds is solely for the revitalization of the silkworm and silk weaving industries, while the five million yuan construction public bonds are for the expansion and development of provincial-run major factories, so they are different.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Fujian Provincial Government to Implement House and Shop Tax, Decided to Start Collection in July, But Farmers Request Postponement <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The provincial house, shop, and land tax was previously ordered by the provincial government to be actively prepared by various counties, with collection scheduled to begin in July. Now, as the deadline approaches, the provincial government has re-issued orders to the counties, requiring that collection begins on schedule. The monthly tax rates are divided into five levels: one yuan, seven jiao five fen, five jiao, two jiao five fen, and one jiao five fen. All proceeds will be allocated to the expenses of the county district offices, and all kinds of Baojia levies will be abolished. If the counties cannot complete the preparations and implement the collection on schedule, the expenses of the district offices will be borne by the county government, and the provincial government will not provide subsidies. Regarding the collection methods, in the provincial capital, Xiamen, Jinjiang, and Longxi, the tax bureau will be responsible for collection and remittance to the provincial treasury. In other areas, the county government will supervise the county collection offices to handle the matter, issuing tax bills to the district offices, which will distribute them to the Lianbao chiefs, who will forward them to the Baojia heads, notifying the taxpayers to pay on time and collect the tax payments, which will be handed over to the district offices and remitted to the county treasury for verification. After receiving the tax bills, the Baojia heads should deliver the payment notification slips to the respective taxpayers before the first day of each month and must not delay. Those who default on tax payments will be reported by the district offices to the county government for punishment according to regulations. Those who delay the notification slips will be investigated by the district offices, reported to the collection offices, and, if verified, may be requested by the county government to be fined one to five yuan. However, the villagers of Minhou and other counties believe that the house and shop tax in the province's cities has been implemented for a long time, while the currently planned collection is all in rural areas. In recent years, the rural areas of various counties have either been ravaged by bandits or suffered from both floods and droughts. The rural economy has been extremely devastated, and the lives of farmers are extremely difficult, and they have no ability to bear this kind of tax. Rural houses are very different from city houses. Most city houses are owned by people above the middle class, used as property for rent, and collect monthly interest, so even if they pay heavier taxes, they can still pass them on to tenants without much difficulty. Rural houses are all self-built, with no one renting them. There are even large houses with leaky roofs, where descendants have difficulty making ends meet. Therefore, they request that the government consider the plight of farmers and approve a postponement. However, the authorities believe that the tax rate of this house and shop tax is fair, and the collection method is simple. It is used to offset the Baojia levies. Currently, the Baojia levies in various counties are arbitrarily apportioned by the Baojia heads without any standards, causing great pain to the people. This time, the provincial government has set grade standards and issued them to the county governments, which will send personnel to the countryside to cooperate with the district offices to conduct detailed household surveys, determine the tax grades, and notify the people to comply. If the people consider it inappropriate, they can raise objections and request corrections. After the house and shop tax is implemented, the Baojia levies will be abolished, which is to reduce the burden on the people and relieve their suffering. If they are truly poor and unable to pay, they can be exempted from tax. It will certainly not cause any difficulties for the people, so the request has not yet been approved. (May 9th)</p>

<p>Yang Huaizhong, the township head of Jiangxi Township in the Third District of this county, privately excavated the "Tomb of Liu Houzhu." After Liu Zhenfeng and others, descendants of the Liu family, discovered it, they alleged that Yang had stolen the ancestral tomb, violating criminal law, and jointly submitted a report to the Eighth District Administrative Inspector Special Commissioner's Office and the Jixi County Government, requesting investigation according to law. The Special Commissioner's Office has now ordered the County Government to conduct a detailed investigation of the case and report back for review. After receiving the order, County Magistrate He immediately dispatched Secretary Yan Bikan to conduct an on-site inspection together with the district heads of the Third and Fourth Districts. At the same time, he sent a letter to the County Party Headquarters Commissioner Dong, requesting a joint investigation to ensure prudence.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Wuxi: Early Silkworm Farmers United, Silkworms Already in Third Sleep <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The spring silkworms in the four rural areas of this county have been raised since they were hatched, nearly a month ago. Due to the climate, which has been cloudy and rainy, their development has been unhealthy. The young silkworms raised by the guidance stations in various townships are in good condition and of better quality. If there are no special changes in the weather, the spring silkworm harvest will be good. Currently, silkworm farming in various townships, such as Qianqiao and Zhouxin Town, is already in the third sleep. The early silkworms are opening their leaves for the first sleep. In Luoshe, Shitangwan, Yuqi, Sitou, Yanqiao, Nanqiao, Bashiqiao, Zhangjingqiao, Fuzhou Village, and Qianzhou and other townships, the large silkworms are opening their leaves for the second sleep, and the late silkworms are in the initial sleep phase. The market price of mulberry leaves in the market is about two yuan per dan. However, the silkworms in areas such as Dongting are mostly undernourished.</p>

<p>The three machine sand casting factories on Tonghui Road Huinong Bridge in this county, Xicheng, Longchang, and Huasheng in Zhou Shanbang, have been in operation for many years, each employing more than one hundred workers, covering a wide area, and with excellent business. However, on the morning of the previous day, around 7:00 a.m., the workers of the three factories suddenly initiated a work stoppage with a firm attitude. The reason for the work stoppage was that more than thirty workers in Xicheng Factory had been laid off. The workers unanimously demanded that the factory reinstate the laid-off workers, but they were not successful. Furthermore, the factory's working hours were unrestricted, leading to the labor unrest. Dong Wenhui and others, the factory owners of Xicheng and other three factories, immediately reported the situation to the Machine Sand Industry Association, requesting assistance in mediation. After receiving the report, the association, considering the severity of the situation and the importance of maintaining overall stability, convened an emergency meeting of the factory owners of Dahua, Yongxing, Xingongji, Sanxin, Guangqin, Huasheng, Xicheng, Longchang, Cao Sanfang, Yongshun, Xiangtai, Jinxin, and Li Hengsheng, discussing mediation methods. It was decided that the association would convene representatives from both labor and management for further negotiations to prevent the labor unrest from escalating. Unexpectedly, on the 11th, Xiangtai, Sanxin, and Guangqin factories also responded to the strike and jointly submitted a request to the Sand Casting Workers' Union for assistance. After receiving the request, the Workers' Union agreed to contact the factory for mediation. It is heard that work may resume on the 12th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Fish Market under the Ministry of Industries held its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday in Dinghai Island, Yangshupu. Over 500 representatives and guests from various sectors, including Mayor Wu and Yang Hu, attended. Liu Weichi, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries, also came to Shanghai to participate. The fish market is scheduled to officially commence operations at 3:00 AM this morning. Yesterday afternoon, the market dispatched vessels from the inspection section to Wusongkou and various locations along the river to guide the fishing vessels affiliated with the market to the Dinghai Island market in preparation for this morning's opening. Chairman Du Yuesheng, General Manager Wang Xiaolai, and others arrived at 2:00 AM this morning to personally provide instructions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Order of Ceremony</p>
<p>Play music to open the meeting; all stand at attention and salute the national flag and the portrait of the Premier; the chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; reports; ministerial address; mayoral address; speeches by guests; responses; photography; tour; adjournment.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>Liu Zuchi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industries; Wu Zhicheng, Mayor; Huang Bodu, representative of Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying; Yang Hu, Garrison Commander of Songhu (represented by Wang Zhinan); Yan Shenyu, Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Industries; Xu Tinghu of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Division; Yu Zuoting of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce; Cai Jingjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau; Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Fish Market; Directors Qian Xinzhi, Lin Kanghou, Huang Yanfang, Yu Kaizhan, Fang Jiaobo, Tang Chengzong; General Manager Wang Xiaolai; Deputy General Managers Zhu Kaiguan, Sun Guchen; and guests Huang Renzhi, Pan Hongding, Hu Xiyuan, Mao Heyuan, Liu Zhanen, and over 500 reporters from various newspapers.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered a speech, saying, "Honorable Minister, Mayor, distinguished guests, it is a great honor for you all to attend the opening of the fish market today. Regarding the significance of the fish market's construction and the importance of its mission, as well as the circumstances since its preparation, a special publication has been printed and offered to you for reference, so I won't say much more. However, I sincerely hope that you will provide any opinions or suggestions you may have regarding the improvement of this market, and I and my colleagues will be ready to accept them. Now, I will briefly report on the situation of the reorganization as a joint public-private venture. Fisheries are a major product of our country, but because there is no unified organization, there are no accurate statistics, which makes it impossible to improve aquaculture, improve fishing gear, alleviate the livelihoods of fishermen, regulate the fishery economy, prevent dumping, and stabilize fish prices. This not only causes losses to the fishing industry but also has a significant impact on the national economy. Therefore, the former Minister of Industry, Chen, resolutely decided to build the fish market. The current Minister, Wu, also sincerely cooperated, accommodating social forces and developing public enterprises. He often discussed the methods of operating the fish market. I felt that for such a new enterprise that protects the interests of the masses, no matter how busy our personal businesses are, we should do our best to help promote the enterprise. In the shortest possible time, 300,000 shares were raised from businesses. In early April, after the Ministry announced the regulations, we had several consultations with Mr. Qian Xinzhi, the official representative. Subsequently, the board of directors and supervisors was established, and a general manager and deputy general manager were appointed. On the 17th, we began the handover and actively prepared, pushing forward various tasks. In the shortest possible time, we arranged everything, and today is the official opening day. My colleagues and I are aware that we are not yet perfect. Moreover, because my personal business is very busy and I do not have enough time to allocate, I was mistakenly elected as chairman, and I cannot do my best. Fortunately, this market is under the supervision of the Minister and has the support of Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Fang Jiaobo, Mr. Kui Yanfang, and other directors and supervisors, as well as the management of Mr. Wang Xiaoxiang and Deputy General Managers Zhu and Sun. Each has their own specialization in their duties. I will work with you to seize this opportunity and, on behalf of all my colleagues, warmly ask all officials and guests to give us clear instructions and be our guiding light in promoting our enterprise."</p>
<p>Liu Weichi's Speech</p>
<p>After the Chairman's report, Liu Weichi, representing Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, delivered a speech, saying, "Today is the opening day of the fish market. China has a very long coastline and rivers and lakes, all of which are important to the fishing industry. The Ministry of Industries, in view of this, has two guidelines for developing the fishing industry: 1. Consolidating consumption; 2. Promoting production. The fish market is for consolidating consumption. China has a large population, and the consumption of fish is very large, especially in Shanghai. According to experts, it reaches 20 million yuan annually. The relationship is so important, yet no one has ever considered the fishery market. Therefore, the Ministry is planning to establish a fish market. The significance of the construction lies in the following points: 1. The consumption of fisheries is very large and requires a corresponding organization. The current fishmongers do not have sanitary refrigeration equipment, so a fish market is being established. The government stands in a supportive position and will neither raise funds nor seek profits from it. It is hoped that fishmongers will have a thorough understanding of this. 2. Promoting production is an especially urgent plan. Our country's fish production is so abundant, yet we still rely on foreign fish. Isn't this ridiculous? The Ministry has a plan to improve the fishing industry, which will be announced soon. The plan is to (A) improve fishing boats, making them like small factories that can produce canned fish on board; (B) provide low-interest loans to fishermen to reduce their burden; (C) protect fishing areas. The Ministry plans in this way and hopes that fishmongers will cooperate so that not only can temporary solutions be achieved, but also permanent solutions can be advanced. This is the significance of the Ministry's plan to establish a fish market and develop the fishing industry."</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech, "I feel very excited to participate in the grand opening ceremony of the fish market today because the government and the people are both paying attention to the organization of production and consumption in our country. The Chinese fishing industry has reached a dead end and will follow other industries into decline. We will soon have to eat foreign fish. If the government and the people do not pay attention, I am afraid that we will not even be able to eat foreign fish and will have to look at paper fish (at this time, he pointed to the paper fish displayed in the market) to satisfy our hunger. In this era of survival of the fittest, we must compete if we want to survive. There are two reasons for the failure of various industries in our country: 1. The production organization is unsound; 2. The consumption organization is unsound. However, the production organization cannot take care of consumption, so the unsound consumption organization often causes the production organization to fail. Now, all countries have reached the era of collective production and collective consumption. If our country continues to have free production, individual production, and small-scale production, failure is inevitable. Now, the fish market is an organization to organize and improve consumption and at the same time promote production and development. Its mission is very important, and its future is infinitely promising. The revival of the fishing industry and the exchange of industrial and commercial economies will benefit from it, so I feel very excited," etc.</p>
<p>Manager's Response</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, the General Manager of the fish market, reported, "This market was advocated and promoted by the former Minister of Industry, Chen, and earnestly supported by enthusiastic leaders from all walks of life. It is fortunate to announce its opening today. It is even more gratifying to have representatives of the party and government, responsible officials, and people from all walks of life come to guide and visit. I am honored to be elected as General Manager. I believe that at the beginning of the reform of fishery administration, the government, fishmongers, and fishermen must be integrated seamlessly, like fish in water, in order to make progress every day. I am a layman in the fishing industry, and at a time when fishmongers and fishermen have not yet fully integrated, I have rashly accepted this position, which is like climbing a tree to catch fish. However, I will act in my own way, do my best, and serve the society. The establishment of the fish market is indeed a new enterprise, and therefore, those who have not deeply studied this enterprise may easily misunderstand it and think that this market is also a purely commercial organization. This view is actually due to a failure to see the government's emphasis on production and its concern for the people's livelihood. The government's purpose in creating this enterprise is to reduce the people's suffering, build production, and prevent foreign forces from oppressing the fishing industry, so as to enable the collapsing national economy to embark on the path of self-reliance and move towards sound construction. All those who study history know that the source of national wealth and strength is based on the national economy. Confucius's saying that there is enough military strength and enough food and Mencius's theory that the people are the most important are all clear examples of this. The importance attached to commerce by Britain and Japan and the efforts to promote production by Soviet Russia, which have made them strong countries, are even more obvious examples. The importance of storing wealth among the people and developing national strength is related. Chairman Chiang's initiative to build the national economy and Minister Kong's advocacy of production construction are also clear examples of the deep relationship between the economy and politics and further knowledge that supporting the national economy is the main way to build the national economy. Statisticians who study politics analyze all political behaviors and know that the driving force of these behaviors is based on the economy. Therefore, in today's international environment of economic competition, if we want to solve the national crisis and find ways to enrich the country and strengthen its military, we must urgently make efforts to promote economic production. The Ministry of Industry's encouragement of the people to jointly establish the Shanghai Fish Market is to reorganize fishery administration and plan to help fishing villages after helping rural areas. There are seven coastal provinces in our country, and the fishermen scattered in the fishing villages of these seven provinces number 40 to 50 million, almost the same as the entire population of Germany. Therefore, the importance of helping fishing villages and fishermen in order to build economic production can be imagined. According to recent expert surveys, the annual productivity of the fishing grounds within our country's territorial waters is valued at 800 million yuan, while the value of the annual fish catch is only 50 million yuan, accounting for only one-eighth. It can be seen that seven-eighths of the produce is left to waste. A detailed study of the reasons for leaving it to waste reveals that fishermen lack economic assistance, resulting in incomplete fishing gear, no thorough defense of the sea surface, no extra strength to cultivate technology, and no overall plan for sales. With these various reasons, they encounter the pressure of foreign forces with strong capital, complete equipment, exquisite technology, and skilled dumping, which has led to the decline of today's fishing villages. If the above reasons can be eliminated, it will be sufficient to seize the seven-eighths of the abandoned fish production, assist fishermen in production, and save the decline of fishing villages. However, this kind of expectation cannot be achieved by empty words. We must first have a cooperative organization between fishermen and fishmongers, and then we can make overall plans, take practical measures, and gradually seek progress, so that the seven-eighths of abandoned fish production can become a factor in building the production economy of fishermen. Some may ask whether there is a concern that the price of fish will fall if the fish catch increases by seven-eighths. As far as we know, this concern is unnecessary. Not counting the foreign fish imported in recent years and the smuggled fish, based solely on the customs import figures, the annual import amount is 40 million yuan. In other words, based on the current situation, the consumption power of the annual number of fish in our country is more than 100 million yuan. If refrigeration and transportation facilities can be further developed in the future, the provinces and regions in the hinterland that lack fish will become vast fish markets. It is also heard that the price of yellow croaker in provinces such as Sichuan is as high as two yuan or more per catty. Therefore, it is estimated that the future domestic consumption of fish may increase by 200 to 300 million yuan, which may not be an unconscious guess. If further efforts are made in the canning industry to seek the development of overseas business, it is not without hope. From this, it can be seen that the fish market's business is not a simple commercial organization, but an organization that conforms to the principles of control, solves the livelihood of fishermen, and builds the economy of fishing villages. If we extend its meaning, it is a good policy of the government to enrich the people and strengthen the country. In the past, the people often criticized the government for failing to benefit the people, but now the government wants to implement good policies to benefit the people, but they are suspicious and hesitant, unwilling to cooperate, or even spread rumors to destroy it. This is truly incomprehensible. This time, I am grateful for the kindness of the board of directors and will do my best to preside over the market administration. My talent and knowledge are insufficient, but I will follow the government's intention to implement good policies, seek the unity of the people in assisting the government, and treat the fishmongers who have not yet understood the value of the fish market's business with the same impartiality. I hope to join in cooperation, strengthen the strength of reorganization, and accelerate the period of construction. Recently, Mussolini said to Italian women that every family in Italy has now become a stronghold against sanctions. This is an address to encourage the people to work hard to cope with the economic war. We should know that in a world where survival depends on grabbing and cheating and morality is declining, we feel the importance of building a defense line, which is even more urgent than a military defense line. If a country's military defense line is well prepared, but its economic defense line is not well organized, once it encounters war, not only will the concerns about the supply of soldiers and refugees affect military combat effectiveness, but also the lack of food for the people will give the enemy an opportunity to cause discord and division. From this, it can be seen that the fish market's business is a part of the government's administration to build the entire national defense force. All citizens should work together to help it succeed, and the responsibilities of fishmongers are even greater. In addition to hoping that a few fishmongers will uphold the spirit of putting public interests first and private interests second, and remember the seriousness of the current national crisis, jointly seek cooperation, we also hope that people from all walks of life will give us instructions at any time. On the day of the market's opening, I will sincerely accept the guidance of all gentlemen and follow the sincerity of our ancestors in lying on ice to seek fish, acting with the sincerity of 120,000 points to seek the closest cooperation with fishmongers and fishermen. This is what my duty requires, and it is also what the welfare of the entire nation depends on. I would like to express my sincere thanks and respect on behalf of all my colleagues," etc. There were also speeches by Yu Qiaqing, Huang Renzhi, Liu Zhanen, and representatives of the Jiangsu Construction Department (all abbreviated).</p>
<p>Visiting the Market</p>
<p>After the closing ceremony at 11:30, Chairman Du Yuesheng, General Manager Wang Xiaolai, Deputy General Managers Zhu Kaiguan and Sun Guchen, etc., led representatives and guests from all walks of life to visit various parts of the fish market. All sectors praised the market's novel construction and unique features. Then, they took photos in the market auction hall to commemorate the event.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Telegrams</p>
<p>Former Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo wrote in a letter, "Mr. Yuesheng and Mr. Xiaolai, I am sorry that I cannot attend the opening ceremony of the fish market due to circumstances. The Shanghai Fish Market is the first market in our country to be self-operated. I am very pleased that you are in charge. Our country's fishing industry is declining day by day. If we do not find a way, it will all be lost. That is why I defied public opinion and overcame all difficulties at that time. Now that Minister Da Quan is in charge above and you are leading below, the vitality of the fishing industry lies in this line. The future development and expansion are immeasurable. I wish you all the best from afar." Mayor of Nanjing Ma Shaojun sent a telegram, "Chairman Du Yuesheng and all directors, supervisors, and managers of the Shanghai Fish Market Co., Ltd., I am pleased to read your telegram and learn that the Shanghai Fish Market Co., Ltd. will hold its opening ceremony on May 11. From now on, profits will be gathered in the southeast, and the operation of Jiaoge will be greatly expanded. Credibility will be established at home and abroad, and the business of Tao Zhu will be renewed every day. I look forward to a bright future and send my congratulations." Chen Feishi, Director of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industries, sent a telegram, "Chairman, Standing Directors, and Managers of the Shanghai Fish Market, marine products are diverse, and fresh food benefits the people. The market opens in the daytime, and its reputation spreads overseas. I have heard of the grand ceremony and send my congratulations." There were also congratulatory telegrams from Huang Zhaohong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government; Wang Gongtao of the Capital Morning Post; Hou Chaohai of the Fish Market Preparatory Committee; Tian Jianai of the Hebei Provincial Fisheries School; Hong Yanbin, Director of the Hebei Provincial Inland Navigation Administration; Wu Xiangqing of the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce; Jiang Zhongliang; gentry Gao Chongshan; Zhao Bingren; Feng Yunchu; and fishing associations from Weihaiwei, Taixian, and other places, totaling more than a hundred.</p>
<p>Opening for Business This Morning</p>
<p>The fish market is scheduled to open for business at 3:00 AM this morning (3:00 AM on the night of the 11th). The number of brokers has been determined to be 40. The list of 28 approved by the board of directors on the 10th includes Qu Shunzhang for fresh and river fish. The remaining 12 slots are reserved for members of the seafood industry association. These 28 brokers have all moved into the market office last night and are ready for business. Trading will begin this morning. Director Du Yuesheng, Standing Director Tang Chengzong, Fang Jiaobo, General Manager Wang Xiaolai, Deputy General Managers Zhu Kaiguan, Sun Guchen, Section Chief Qu Jiugao of the Second Section, and the heads of each section, inspectors, etc., are all working through the night and staying at the market to prepare for overseeing the market trading this morning.</p>
<p>Dispatching Vessels for Guidance</p>
<p>As this is a pioneering undertaking, the market is deeply concerned that fishing boats and vessels may not be familiar with the route to the market. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the Second Section dispatched Inspection Section Chief Yin Gongtian, along with several inspectors, and hired the tugboat Xinmei to patrol outside Dinghai Island. If any fishing vessels are encountered, they will be guided to the market pier for unloading and trading at 3:00 AM this morning. At the same time, Maoxing Tugboat Company has been commissioned to go outside Wusongkou to ask the Wusong customs clearance industry to assist in the inspection. If any fishing vessels or boats are imported, the Maoxing vessel will tow them to the market. If the fishing boat does not want to be towed, the Wusong inspector will immediately notify the market by telegram, and the market will send a small vessel in advance to wait at the main roads outside the port to take them to the dock and order them to trade at the market.</p>
<p>Concentrated Trading</p>
<p>Although the market is scheduled to open this morning, fishing vessels and boats began to sail in yesterday afternoon. Because the market was well-arranged in advance, most of the fishing boats entered the market pier. Therefore, the fishing vessels and boats concentrated at the market pier last night included Quanhaoxing, Xinleqing, Wang Ziming, Wang Shaoxing, Gong Jinji, Wang Shaoliu, Jin Yongfa, Yang Ayong, Jin Fuxing, Jin Deli, Guangyu No. 1, Guangyu No. 2, and dozens of others. There was a lot of fish, and the fish market transactions this morning were all concentrated at the fish market. As for the fishmongers in the Sixteen Pux area, most of them collect the fish and then transfer it to the fish market for trading.</p>

<p>The Chinese Industrial Federation and the National General Chamber of Commerce, due to the Anhui Province's control of Qimen tea, previously sent representative Qian Chengxu to Anhui to petition. Mr. Qian returned to Shanghai by Beijing-Shanghai train at 11 p.m. the night before last. He will report the mediation situation to the National General Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Industrial Federation for consideration. The formal written statement prepared by the two associations has also been revised by the committees of the two associations and is scheduled to be delivered to the Ministry of Industry, the Anhui Provincial Government, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the foreign tea merchants' guild before the 15th of this month to determine the fundamental plan for the Chinese tea industry. The following is a transcript of Mr. Qian's speech and the letter from the Chinese Industrial Federation to the foreign tea merchants' guild:</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu's Speech: Describing the Petition</p>
<p>I was entrusted by the two associations to act as a mediator, with two purposes: First, regarding the suspension of cash payments by tea firms, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is already directly negotiating (the National General Chamber of Commerce is a national organization, and in terms of its position, it is relatively detached). Because the matter involves the entire Chinese tea industry in the future, Mr. Lin Kanghou felt it was necessary to come forward to maintain it. Second, Chinese cotton cloth and inland tea have always been exchanged, but the suspension of cash payments has greatly affected cotton cloth. The association, in response to the requests from yarn factories and yarn merchants, resolutely took on the responsibility of mediating this situation. I departed from Shanghai on the 28th of the previous month and arrived at the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing the next day to seek instructions. I learned that the Anhui Provincial Government had already released cash to tea merchants, amounting to more than 1.4 million yuan, with more to be released later. Seeing this situation, I knew that it was impossible to reverse the Anhui Province's control in fact. Therefore, I consulted with the Ministry of Industry on a compromise solution. The main point of this solution is that the government would be responsible for planting, improving, inspecting, transporting, while the sales would be entirely managed by merchants, so as to achieve the effect of government-merchant cooperation. The Ministry of Industry expressed deep agreement with my idea in principle. Thereupon, on the evening of the 30th, I urgently telegraphed the Yuan and Provincial Governments for reference. This is the process of my first contact with the Ministry of Industry. I arrived in Anqing on the 1st of this month and immediately negotiated with the Provincial Government authorities based on this principle. After several rounds of negotiations, a written understanding was reached on the 3rd of this month. At the same time, the Anhui Provincial Government also telegraphed the Shanghai representatives to directly negotiate with the tea firm merchants. My task came to a conclusion at this point. I returned to Nanjing on the 5th and, at the invitation of Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, had a long conversation. Minister Wu was extremely concerned about Chinese industry and also convened the Vice Minister and Directors in the Minister's office for a discussion. He also instructed me to provide a detailed report for verification. I stayed in Nanjing for a total of three days. The initial draft of the report has now been completed and will be slightly revised and jointly published by the two associations in the short term. When the reporter asked what kind of statement the Ministry of Industry had made regarding the so-called understanding method, and whether the content of the report could be summarized, Mr. Qian replied that regarding the first question, because Anhui was already under control, other tea-producing provinces, such as Zhejiang and Jiangxi, had either joined Anhui's organization or were reportedly planning to do so. Therefore, from the perspective of the central industrial authority, it was not possible to take care of everything and formulate an overall plan. How to determine this overall plan will take quite some time. However, the establishment of a company was confirmed as the only compromise solution, and it could thereby promote the soundness of merchant organizations. Everything is currently under negotiation with the Anhui Provincial Government, and it is expected that there will be a solution soon. As for the program of the report, it is divided into four chapters: the cause of the dispute, the process of mediation, the purpose of the proposal, and the future of Chinese tea. The material for the fourth chapter is mostly supplied and participated in by the competent authorities, and is a combination of this investigation and observation. It is expected that it will not involve the drawbacks of emptiness. In the future, as long as the government is impartial and takes more responsibility, and government and merchants cooperate, and merchants can also actively improve the existing foundation to conform to modern economic organizations, then the future external position of Chinese tea can, at a minimum, restore the old situation, which is not a problem.</p>
<p>Letter from the Chinese Industrial Federation to the Foreign Merchants' Guild</p>
<p>The Chinese Industrial Federation yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants' Guild, saying, "Regarding the issue of the Anhui Provincial Government's monopoly on the transportation and sale of black tea, which once involved the suspension of cash payments by Shanghai tea firms, our association, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, resolved at a joint meeting on April 27 of this year to send representative Qian Chengxu to Anhui to propose suggestions to the Anhui authorities, hoping to resolve the misunderstandings between the two parties and restore the old situation in the short term. Representative Qian departed from Shanghai on the 28th of the previous month, first going to the capital to seek instructions from the Ministry of Industry. He considered the surrounding environment and learned that the alliance of the Anhui, Lai, and Zhejiang provinces had been completed, and that the Anhui and Jiangxi provinces had separately released huge sums of money, so there was no saving the situation. The representative then suggested a compromise solution based on the situation at the time, with merchants voluntarily adopting the principle of collective organization to interact with the government, and the fundamental way out for China's future business would be adopted by the Ministry of Industry. It immediately telegraphed the Anhui authorities for negotiation. Near the 3rd of the previous month, the representative reached a three-article understanding with the Provincial Government in Anqing. The meaning of the second article also adopted the spirit of the representative's new proposal, with the official presiding over the production and transportation, while the sales would be reserved for merchants to operate. Representative returned to Beijing on the 5th of this month and reported the situation to the Minister of Industry, who was received, expressed satisfaction, and hoped that the merchants would understand this and implement it as soon as possible. The central government will negotiate with Anhui Province again in the near future to promote this matter. The corresponding written understanding between the representative and the Anhui Provincial Government is hereby attached. Please check it for your information. This is addressed to the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants' Guild."</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Siam, in order to integrate Chinese and Siamese medicine, has specially sent Ren Bikan Nanda, who serves in the Royal Naval Hospital, to China to enter Tsinghua University in Beijing to study medicine and China's health administration. Mr. Ren arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Dollar Line's President Jefferson, staying at the New Asia Hotel. He plans to tour Shanghai for two or three days before going directly to Beijing to enroll. The reporter made a special visit, and the following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<p>Ren Jun's Biography</p>
<p>Mr. Ren is 37 years old and a member of the Siamese royal family. After graduating from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok in his early years, he served in the navy, becoming an important member of the lower-ranking officers in the Siamese Navy. He was once sent to travel to various European and American countries. Later, with aspirations for medicine, he served in the Royal Naval Hospital. Recently, the Siamese government specially sent Mr. Ren to China to study medicine at Tsinghua University in Beijing and study the facilities of China's health administration for a period of one year before returning home.</p>
<p>Sino-Siamese Relations</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency had a detailed discussion on the relationship between China and Siam. Mr. Ren believes that it is necessary to definitely improve the current Sino-Siamese relations. The Siamese people all feel that the Sino-Siamese commercial treaty is extremely urgent and should be signed as soon as possible to bring the national relations into a normal track. The Siamese government's promulgation of Chinese schools and the addition of Siamese language courses is aimed at promoting culture. The head tax on entry has increased by one hundred Siamese baht, which is also a general levy, not only on overseas Chinese. However, there are more Chinese residents, and those who are taxed are all overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Siamese King Studies Abroad</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the young Siamese emperor is studying in the UK and believes in Christianity, there is a saying in the Siamese country that he should be asked to abdicate. Mr. Ren denied this, saying that although there are rumors in Bangkok, this is not the case in fact. The young emperor is still studying in London with his mother and queen. The claim of abdication is indeed inaccurate, because the Siamese government has no change at present.</p>

They are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan on a Norwegian ship tomorrow (13th) to present their credentials. At 11 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Goran, accompanied by Consul General Orr, drove to the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road to pay a visit to the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to China, Wakasugi Kaname, for ordinary greetings.

<p>The Sericulture Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission previously had a proposal to organize a Jiangsu-Zhejiang joint silk factory in order to improve silk reeling technology and achieve high quality. However, due to various reasons, it was stopped. It is now known that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Associations, in view of the fact that improving silk reeling technology is indeed an essential plan, on the one hand can unify the quality, and on the other hand can reduce production costs, making it easier for international sales. They plan to establish a large-scale joint silk reeling cooperative, which is currently in the planning stage and plans to unite large and small silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Shanghai Silver Industry Representatives Petitioned Party and Government Organs Yesterday Afternoon, Raising Two Demands for Revising Silver Usage Rules, Party and Government Replied That They Agreed to Forward to the Central Government for Verification <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Usage in Silver Products," the Shanghai Silver Industry Guild petitioned the Party and government organs at 2 p.m. yesterday, due to the impact on business and workers' livelihoods, raising two demands. The authorities agreed to forward them to the Central Government for verification. The following are the details investigated and recorded by the Takungpao reporter:</p>
<p>Petition in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Silver Industry Guild held an emergency meeting on the 10th and elected Yuan Xingzhi, Sun Bingchu, Yuan Guoxiang, Yu Ruichun, Xu Xianglin, and five others to form a petition delegation. They went to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on Tianhougong Bridge, the Municipal Central District Government, and the Municipal Party Headquarters on Fenglin Bridge at 2 p.m. yesterday to petition. Fellow traders in various places also elected representatives to petition the Party and government authorities in their respective areas, and then agreed on a date to go to Beijing together and again to the Ministry of Finance to seek amendments to the silver usage management regulations.</p>
<p>Two Demands</p>
<p>The petition representatives of the silver industry in this city, in accordance with the resolution of the fellow traders, put forward two demands: Please forward the request to the Ministry of Finance to change the general silver management regulations. Before the regulations are revised, please suspend the implementation of the regulations. The original silver content should be maintained. The representatives of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Hongjun, the representative of the Municipal Government, Yu Mingde, and the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Huang Changren, respectively received the representatives of the industry and agreed to forward the request to the Central Government for verification, hoping that the representatives would persuade the fellow traders to wait for a solution.</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>Submitting a petition regarding the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Usage in Silver Products" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, restricting the use of chemical silver products, forcing silver workshops to close, cutting off the livelihoods of silver workers, and forcing them to publicly recommend representatives to ask Your (Government) (Association) to grant relief to save the lives of all people. Our silver industry has a long history of creating and inventing utensils. The workers engaged in the manufacture of silverware are all over the country. In Shanghai alone, more than 100,000 people rely on the silver trade and silver work to support their families, making it one of the few handicrafts in our country, which is of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Since last year, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Usage in Silver Products," restricting the use of chemical silver products, requiring 30% silver content when necessary. The market was shaken by it, and customers lost their faith, resulting in the industry's work decreasing day by day, and the livelihood becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. The reason why the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Usage in Silver Products" is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from selling silver products for profit. However, the selling price of our industry's silver products is the sum of the silver value and the labor cost. In addition to the amount of silver calculated at the market price, the labor cost is determined by the complexity of the manufacturing pattern. For ordinary finished products, the selling price contains a silver value and a labor cost, with the silver value accounting for two parts and the labor cost accounting for one part. For those with more complex patterns, the labor cost is often more than two-fifths of the selling price. Even if there are unscrupulous merchants selling silver, they must abandon it due to excessive sacrifice. Those who know the inside story of our industry all know this. Now the Ministry of Finance restricts the use of chemical silver products, which is indeed something that our handicraft industry cannot make. Chemical silver is made by melting various metals and can be manufactured by machine. If it is manufactured by hand, it will be broken as soon as it is hammered, and the color will be dark, and it will never be liked by the public. As for mixing silver by 30%, although the association has repeatedly tested it, it is too hard to make utensils. If we want to equip machines, the capacity of each workshop is limited. Moreover, in the current state of depression, the status quo cannot be maintained, so where can there be surplus funds to purchase machines, and artificial training cannot be achieved between shouts. Since last year, after the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Usage in Silver Products," the silver workers and silver workers in our city are almost like prisoners sentenced to death. The people are panicked and cannot live a day. Now the silver usage deadline is about to expire, and the only remaining silver product handicraft industry in the country will soon be on the verge of extinction. The people petition for fear of reaching the decrees. Therefore, they publicly recommend Yuan Xingzhi, Yu Ruichun, Yuan Guoxiang, Sun Bingchu, and other twelve people as petition representatives to appeal to Your (Government) (Association) to show pity, and the livelihoods of more than 100,000 silver workers and silver workers in this city. Please ask the Ministry of Finance to revise the "Regulations on the Management of Silver Usage in Silver Products" to maintain the original silver content, so as to maintain the national industry, and save the lives of all people. Before the Ministry of Finance revises it, please allow Your Government to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance for temporary products as before, so that the livelihoods of silver workers and silver workers in the city will not be interrupted. There is extreme urgency. This is respectfully presented to the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Department, and the Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Yu.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Telephone Problem Committee Respectfully Informs That Chinese Shareholders Should Have a Solemn Statement That Telephone Should Strive for Universality and Take Profits From More, Otherwise, the Fewer Users, the Result Will Still Be Failure <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee, due to the Shanghai Telephone Company's illegal price increase, which has caused social unrest, yesterday respectfully informed all Chinese shareholders of the company, asking them to express a solemn proposition. The letter says that since the Shanghai Telephone Company, in the context of the market downturn, has rashly hoped to satisfy the desire for an annual interest rate of one point, the absurd move of demanding a price increase has occurred. Public opinion is unanimously opposed. Therefore, since its implementation, users have refused to pay, allowing the demolition of equipment and reporting the inaccuracies in counting to promote moral sanctions. Telephones are public utilities and communication tools. They should strive for universality, with low fees and more installations as the principle. Even if the company is concerned about business, it should take profits from more, otherwise, the more the telephone fees increase, the fewer the users, and the company will inevitably fail. Now we have received a letter from Mr. Chen Zhixian, a Chinese shareholder of the company, saying that he has repeatedly sent letters to oppose the company's outrageous price increase during this most depressed period, regardless of the difficulties of merchants, but he has not been able to redress the grievance. Those in charge lack a sense of morality and humble personality. The company ignores the current social situation, increases the burden on users, and implements inhumane price increases. We are unwilling to increase telephone fees, but only seek to share the previously determined official interest, which is sufficient. Please urge your association to strive hard to achieve the final victory. We will contact the shareholders of our country who have invested in the company to support your association, and suggest that the company rectify its internal affairs, save expenses to meet the budget, reduce the burden on users, and achieve the effect of cooperation, etc. It can be seen that Mr. Chen is considering the interests of the public and is not tempted by profits, which is admirable. In addition to hoping to carry out the purpose to achieve the effect of cooperation, our association, based on the resolutions of the joint meeting of various groups, respectfully informs all Chinese shareholders to rise up and make a solemn statement, to ensure the cancellation of this illegal and disguised price increase, and unethical floating accounting behavior. Sincerely pray, not to mention the desire. This is addressed to all Chinese shareholders of the Shanghai Telephone Company. Shanghai Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e105">The National Goods to Relieve Unemployment Group Receives National Goods Manufacturers Today: Pledging and Selling to Raise Funds for Promoting National Goods, Earning a Small Commission to Maintain Life <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The China National Goods to Relieve Unemployment Group, located at No. 14, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road in this city, has gained sympathy from all walks of life since it started its work on the 4th, and its business has developed greatly. It is now heard that the group, in order to increase its sales strength and to connect with various manufacturers, has specially arranged to receive national goods manufacturers at the group this afternoon. Those who have been invited include Nanyang Soap Factory, Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory, Jiufu Company, Qinye Stationery Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Taikang Food Company, Guanshengyuan, Yixin Toothbrush Company, Zhengtai Rubber Factory, and more than 30 other companies, as well as Fang Jiaobo, Wang Yansong, Zhang Zi, Lin Kanghou, Wu YunChu, and more than 10 other people. The group's announcement to all walks of life is copied as follows:</p>
<p>Dear compatriots from all walks of life, we hope you will accept our tragic and sorrowful statement. Society and the environment have formed today's unemployment and the coercion of life for us. The facts have generally told you very clearly, but we who have lost the completeness of life are constantly using our dry brains to think about striving for our survival, curing the raging waves of unemployment, and restoring the original state of society. Indeed, nature has given us a strong will and broad desires, but we, who are empty-handed, although holding that pleasant and exciting motivation, do not have the capital to initiate our intellectual resources, thus creating</p>
<p>a tragic cry of widespread mourning. Material is originally an element of struggle and a foundation of effort. Losing its supply, then no matter how rich you are in intellect and enthusiasm, you still wander in the middle of the sand dunes, facing the crowd walking into the wilderness, only to cry and sigh. Although in today's society, many charitable public groups that have received social praise have also been produced, from a subjective point of view, we absolutely cannot see the tragic scenes of folk weeping and wailing, the air composed of cries and moans. Therefore, relief cannot obtain a unified effect, and on the contrary, it becomes a situation of little medicine and many diseases. This is the mistake of subjectivity.</p>
<p>The reason for the failure of relief is that material relief to mankind is a temporary policy, and studying the foundation of people's livelihood is the fundamental reason. In our country's situation of being besieged on all sides today, not only can we not cure the current crisis by relying solely on charitable relief, but also, if we continue like this for a long time, we will create an unimaginable situation. We hope that all gentlemen in society will pay close attention. We are a group of unfortunate people in society. All the pain in society is combined and entangled on our bodies, but we are unwilling to have the lifeline monopolized in this way. Therefore, in absolute hardship, we do not</p>
<p>wait for the knife to cut our necks because we have no strength. We should also constantly struggle with inherent courage and bloodiness, and use our running and shouting to urge the universal relief of all gentlemen in society, and at the same time awaken the unfortunate compatriots in hunger and cold, and use our own labor to control our own lives. The road to life has discovered our light after our endless thinking. We only hope that all gentlemen in society will give us a little Kang Ji's Secretary Please. We are now willing to exchange power and material for the essence of life, seek the consent of several domestic practical product manufacturers, and</p>
<p>pledge and sell all of our possessions, raise some funds, organize this group, represent them in sales, and earn some small commissions as the price of our spirit and labor, so that we can obtain a holy and pure occupation and a comfortable life during the unemployment period. Now we offer a few pieces of household practical products, totaling two jiao of ocean money. We hope you will grant us acceptance.

<h3 id="e109">Zhejiang Provincial Labor Service - The Zhejiang General Assembly Submits Opinions <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang General Assembly believes that the Zhejiang Provincial People's Labor Service Law still needs to be sorted out. Therefore, it submitted four opinions and requested the Zhejiang Provincial Government to adopt them. The submitted opinions and the Zhejiang Provincial Government's reply telegram are recorded together below:</p>
<p>The Zhejiang General Assembly submitted four opinions on the Zhejiang Provincial Labor Service: 1. Shorten the service period and issue a general order to all counties to handle it in a unified manner. It has been found that some counties stipulate that labor service is for ten days, which is too long. Ordinary coolies and laborers have no food for the next night at home and rely entirely on the daily labor price for the needs of a family's life. Moreover, within a family, all able-bodied men of age must go to enlist together, leaving only the old, weak, women, and children at home, who are unable to find food, and suffer from long-term freezing and starvation. The situation is particularly pitiful. Previously, Chairman Chiang ordered the people to perform service, which was only limited to three days. It is heard that Jiangsu Province also only stipulates three days. It seems appropriate to issue a clear order to shorten the service period to three days and issue a general order to all counties, townships, and towns to handle it in a unified manner in order to show sympathy. 2. The service period should be from January to March every year. No conscription should be carried out during the silkworm raising and farming season, so that the people can be timely and not violate the farming season. The ancients had clear instructions. At this time, the spring farming is in full swing, and the silkworm season is approaching. It is the busiest time for farmers to work. The annual living expenses all depend on the income from the fields and silkworms. Recently, it has been heard that Deqing is collecting laborers to start work on dredging rivers, while Jiaxing, Jiashan, Haiyan, and other counties are still conscripting workers to build the Hangshan Road and other highways, which is the biggest blow to farmers. It should be ordered to temporarily stop work and replenish the conscription after the farming is slightly free and the autumn is cool. 3. For service locations more than ten li away, food should be provided as appropriate. It is difficult to serve the public with an empty stomach, and it is especially pitiful to carry grain from afar. If people are conscripted for service, such as being more than ten li away, they are far away from home and difficult to take care of. They must not only raise funds to support their families, but also buy food to fill their stomachs. Poor farmers and workers, how can they have such ability? It should be appropriate to provide food, and the money will be spent from the income of the substitute service money. 4. The collection of substitute service money should be carefully investigated and not regarded as a legal income, similar to extortion. The item of substitute service money was originally a slight punishment for those who evaded service. Those who have been conscripted in other counties, or who do not want to be conscripted but have no work to do, should be exempted from collection. At this time of rural bankruptcy, leaving a little vitality for the people should also be something that the loving and long-serving officials are happy to allow.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government replied by telegram, saying, "Shanghai Zhejiang General Assembly, I have learned about the opinions on sorting out the measures for national labor service submitted by telegram in April. After investigation, the Military Commission's camp has approved that able-bodied men serve for ten days for this year's labor service, but except for the counties through which the Hangjia Road passes, due to special construction reasons, there are indeed those who serve for ten days, and the rest are mostly around three days. As for the service period, it was originally scheduled to end at the end of March. Occasionally, a few counties have submitted applications for appropriate extensions in order to complete the construction, and they have all been ordered to not hinder farming. Now, they have been strictly ordered to stop work and end it. Able-bodied men who are recruited from afar have also been ordered to give food according to the situation to show sympathy. As for the able-bodied men in the fixed urban area, if they cannot be recruited due to accidents and it is verified that it is true, they are only allowed to pay money as a substitute for service. This is not regarded as income according to the rules. The able-bodied men who have been recruited in other counties or who are not in the construction area are all exempted from paying substitute service money. The situation of this session's labor service is in line with the opinions of your association. However, the matter is a pioneering one, and each department may not be able to understand this meaning, and the handling may not be uniform. We will pay close attention to correcting it. The Zhejiang Provincial Government."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ningbo Compatriots Telegraph to Request the Restoration of Huang Renfu's Position: The Injustice Has Been Cleared, Please Restore the Original Position <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>

<h3 id="e111">Tang Zongguo and Wan Zhen Report <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Tang Zongguo, the director of the Anhui emergency relief investigation and distribution of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces, came to Shanghai yesterday (10th). According to the report, Huoqiu County in western Anhui Province was the most severely affected, with many deaths. Few middle-aged women were seen. The disaster situation in Shouxian, Yingshang, Liuan, and Lihuang counties was also severe. Residents in the countryside have no food to eat, but the wheat and barley seedlings are still good. If it is sunny, it is hoped that there will be a harvest. However, the next month is a critical time for the survival of the disaster victims. The counties that are currently being relieved are Huoqiu with 32,100 yuan (including 26,000 yuan from the Beijing Relief Committee, 1,000 yuan raised by Nie Yuntai, 6,100 yuan from the Shanghai Righteous Relief Association, 2,000 yuan specifically for Xu Mingjie, and 1,200 yuan specifically for Gao Henian), Shouxian with 8,100 yuan (including 5,000 yuan from the Relief Committee, 3,100 yuan from the Shanghai Righteous Relief Association, 700 yuan raised by Cheng Jingsheng specifically for Zhulongji, and 400 yuan specifically for Zhengyangguan), Liuan with 5,000 yuan (all allocated by the Shanghai Righteous Relief Association), Yingshang with 3,700 yuan (allocated by the Shanghai Righteous Relief Association, including 1,700 yuan specifically for the Xinlianju), and Hefei with 2,000 yuan (allocated by the Shanghai Righteous Relief Association, the memorial money of He Zhongxiao). There is also 1,000 yuan specifically for the Brave Lord, which is planned to be added to the above-mentioned counties that are insufficient. The above-mentioned counties have a total of 53,900 yuan for relief (including 30,000 yuan from the Relief Committee, 12,000 yuan from the Shanghai Righteous Relief Association's lucky fruit ticket money, and 11,900 yuan specifically for various parties), some of which have been completed (such as Huoshou), or are being investigated and distributed (such as Liuan), or are being distributed to people (such as Yingshang and Hefei). Huoqiu has also established 11 porridge factories to feed tens of thousands of disaster victims until the wheat is harvested. However, they are all just stopgap measures, only temporarily saving one life at a time. It is still hoped that philanthropists can continue to allocate funds within the month. One more yuan means saving one more life. The original purpose of coming to Shanghai was to discuss the agricultural loans in Huoqiu with Chairman Liu and Finance Director Yang of Anhui Province. It is proposed to first change the 50,000 yuan for wasteland reclamation loans and the 80,000 yuan for the city's western river dredging project into agricultural loans at once, and then handle wasteland reclamation and canal dredging separately after recovery, so that the disaster victims can obtain agricultural loans to purchase cattle breeds and avoid delaying the farming season. The negotiation has been completed and he came to Shanghai to report on the way. He will return to the disaster area tomorrow. The situation of lack of cattle breeds in counties other than Huoqiu is the same. After consultation, the Relief Committee has transferred the letter from the Economic Commission to the cooperative committee's resident office in Anhui to handle agricultural loans in western Anhui, which can often be transferred and handled.</p>

<p>Yuan Ying, the director of the China Buddhist Association, said that Ningbo Tiantong Temple is one of the famous temples. In the 21st year, more than 50 rooms, including the Heavenly King Hall, were burned, causing a loss of more than 400,000 yuan. Now, Yuan Ying, together with Jingxin, the retired abbot of the temple, and Wen Zhi, the supervisor Zhiheng, and others, have made great wishes and have worked hard for three years. The burned houses have been completely restored, and more than 30 new houses have been added. Now they have all been completed. The completion ceremony will be held from the first day to the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar. It is also learned that Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, Wang Yiting, Guan Jiongzhi, and other celebrities in this city will go to visit during the period. Yuan Ying will also return to Ningbo before the ceremony to preside over everything.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Pu Shi Case Was Adjudicated by the Administrative Court: The Punishment of the Jianghai Customs Was Revoked: One Action Cannot Be Punished Again: The Legal Principle Should Be Maintained <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Chen Kaiqing, a merchant from Fujian, previously imported Pu Shi. The Jianghai Customs believed that the quoted price was inconsistent and imposed a fine. Chen Kaiqing paid the fine and took the Pu Shi, which was being opened and processed, but the material was detained by the Jianghai Customs again, pointing out that the tax rate was forged. Chen often requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to request the return of the goods based on the principle that one matter cannot be punished again according to law, but it was still ineffective. Subsequently, the Jianghai Customs decided to confiscate the Pu Shi and impose another fine. Chen Shang refused to accept this and filed an appeal with the Customs Service according to law. As a result, the original punishment was still maintained. Chen Shang then filed a lawsuit with the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court has now ruled that the main text is to revoke the original decision and the punishment made by the Jianghai Customs on October 8, 24th year of the Republic of China. The reason is as follows: According to the obligation prescribed by laws and regulations that people violate, the competent authorities should impose a certain sanction on it based on the behavior that occurred. If the several behaviors they have committed are all based on one intention and have no independent nature, then although there are differences in purpose and means, they are only individual actions that make up the behavior of violating the obligation, and should still be regarded as one behavior. The competent authorities have already imposed penalties on the behavior that occurred, and the state of violation of obligations no longer continues to exist. There is no reason to impose the same responsibility again. In this case, the original declaration of Pu Shi, the tax bill submitted for inspection, after the Jianghai Customs found out that the Burmese Wanyue jadeite must be stamped by the tax-included businessman on the stone, the original complaint on the tax bill stated that the tax-included businessman was the Shengxing Company, while the stamp on the stone was the Shizhen stamp. The circumstances of this case are not without doubt. However, in terms of the original accusation's statement of the tax bill submitted for verification, although it may be inevitable to have the suspicion of forgery or substitution, it is only a means to achieve the purpose of concealing tax payments. At that time, if the Customs believed that it was insufficient to be trustworthy, it could use its power to deal with it as appropriate, and then punish it after the investigation was clear. However, according to the tax bill submitted by the original accusation, the value of the Pu Shi was determined to be 1,334 yuan and 58 cents in gold units, and a fine of 600 yuan was imposed for short reporting the value of the goods. On the one hand, the tax was paid according to the usual practice, and the goods were released on the 27th day of the year. After the above-mentioned punishment was completed, until October 8th, a fine of 15,000 yuan was imposed again for the same behavior, and the Pu Shi was confiscated, and the tax was ordered to be paid again. It is difficult to say that the above-mentioned explanations are in accordance with the original decision not to correct, but to maintain the effectiveness of the original punishment. The legal opinion is also not very harmonious. It should be revoked by this court together. Based on the above conclusion, the original accusation's lawsuit is justified, and it is in accordance with Article 21 of the Administrative Litigation Law. The judgment is as in the main text.</p>

<p>Chen Meisheng, the backstage manager of the Anle Theater in Zhabei, was about to take over the Sanmin Theater on Bailinan Road and needed to go to Suzhou to purchase property. He instructed his wife, Ms. Ji, to borrow 200 yuan in national currency from her mother's family on the 30th of last month and carried it out of the theater. When passing through the intersection of Xinzha Road and Parker Road, Yiyuan Lane, more than ten people suddenly rushed up from behind and beat Chen severely, causing Chen to lose consciousness. By the time he woke up, the ten or more people had disappeared, and the one hundred yuan of national currency in his pocket had disappeared. Chen then reported to the Xinzha Police Station and claimed that on April 27th, hooligans such as Xu Fugen came to the Anle Theater to borrow 20 yuan from me, which I refused, and my wife saw Xu when she handed the money to me. Therefore, it is decided that this may have been done by Xu. At the same time, he also pointed out that Ye Hu A Liu and Deng Chengqing were also involved. A few days ago, the police detectives arrested Xu Ge at the intersection of Keninghai Road and Aierjin Road. Yesterday morning, they sent him to the Criminal Court 8 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the previous situation, followed by Chen Meisheng and others proving everything. Xu Fugen's confession was that Ye Hu A Liu had a dispute with Chen Meisheng's apprentice in the Anle Theater before, so Ye Hu A Liu ordered me to go to fight on the evening of the 30th, but there was no robbery. After the confession was examined by Judge Tan, the hearing was postponed.</p>

<p>The Beiyang Scaled Pearl Dried Fish Touzai arrived in Wusong yesterday. The boat is named Xu Fashun and is sold by Cuisheng Fish Bank. The price is 18 yuan and 2 jiao per load. Because this dried fish has white and bright scales and a fresh taste, it is sold very widely. People from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places have sent people to sit in Song to handle it. However, the one that arrived yesterday was a small boat from Yancheng, and only forty or fifty fish were caught. Therefore, it is only enough for distribution in this city.

<h3 id="e117">Horrifying Large-Scale Theft Case: Local Court Evidence Depository – One Box of Stolen Handguns, Totaling Twenty, Plus Numerous Bullets – Officials and Staff Suspected All Ordered to Post Bail – President Luo Goes to Beijing to Report the Grave Situation <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court has, over the years, confiscated a large number of handguns in the course of hearing theft cases. Among them were twenty-two of the newest models, packed in a separate box, all stored in the evidence depository. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday, during the latter half of the night, the evidence depository was suddenly found to be opened, the lock broken. Upon discovery by a public servant, the head of the evidence depository was notified to investigate. It was then discovered that the handguns had all been stolen, totaling twenty-two. A radio was also missing. A damaged radio, however, was found discarded at the back door. The incident was immediately reported to President Luo Tong. Considering the theft from the court's evidence depository to be truly unusual and a grave matter, he immediately requested the Prosecutor's Office to investigate. As a result of the investigation by the prosecutor, the head of the depository, the clerk, and the public servants were all suspected and ordered to post bail. Subsequent investigation revealed that the evidence depository was located next to the Thirteenth Court, with a straight corridor leading directly to the back door in front of the dormitory. The entering and exiting thieves all used this back door. Furthermore, the lock on the back door was also damaged, and the lock was on the inside of the door, indicating that the thieves were already inside when the back door was closed. According to people inside the court, the back door was still open at nine o'clock at night. Therefore, there are many people suspected of negligence in this case. As a result, at 3 p.m. yesterday, Chief Clerk Yin Wenlian invited Zhang Datong, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team, to the court to jointly convene and question all the on-duty staff and public servants in the East Deliberation Room for a long time. Zhao Sheng, the dormitory doorman, was considered suspicious and also ordered to post bail. Meanwhile, President Luo Tong and Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin traveled together by car to the capital to meet with the Minister of Justice and report everything. It is feared that the stolen handguns will be used by bandits for illegal purposes. Therefore, the serial numbers of the handguns have been mimeographed and circulated to all agencies to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>Another reporter reports that the Shanghai Local Court's evidence armory has two doors, both locked with spring locks and additionally secured with iron bolts, ensuring strict safekeeping and great sturdiness. Unexpectedly, it was stolen from the night before last. The door locks were destroyed with electricity to gain entry. The stolen items include handguns and bullets confiscated from criminals by the Public Security Bureau. The gun numbers, bullet counts, and names of the criminals are listed in detail below: Miscellaneous Character Number 1112, firearm of criminal Li Wufei, one 6-inch handgun, serial number 24183, six bullets, three magazines, two shell casings.

After obtaining the stolen goods, the thieves further stole a radio and a police officer’s overcoat from the outer room. The thieves escaped through the iron gate of the court's detention center. After the theft, Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin of the court specifically requested Zhang Datong, the captain of the Municipal Police Bureau Detective Brigade, to go to the court to investigate the surroundings in order to begin the investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Female Teacher Claims Frame-Up Case; Prosecutor's Office Opened Investigation Yesterday; Shen Shuqing and Yu Shangxun Both Released on Bail <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yu Shangxun, the principal of Minhua Elementary School (now renamed Chunjiang Elementary School) at No. 10 Gaowen Lane, Weihaiwei Road, from Ningbo, Xiangshan, previously reported to the Chengdu Road Police that teacher Ding Jiasheng (i.e., Ding Hao) had stolen several suits. The police dispatched detectives, arrested Ding, and found many pawn tickets in Ding's box, some of which belonged to the original stolen goods. However, Ding claimed that the pawn tickets were planted by female teacher Shen Shuqing of the same school, and the reason was actually a love triangle. But Shen consistently denied any relationship with Ding and Yu, and also denied the act of planting the evidence. The First Special Court sentenced Ding for theft, with a three-month prison sentence, suspended. Although Ding appealed, it was rejected. Later, Shen suddenly accused Yu of rape and intimidation in the First Special Court, but withdrew the lawsuit after reconciliation. Recently, Ding obtained a letter from Shen Shuqing to female teacher Wang Zuzhen of Minhua Elementary School, which stated that Yu's case against Ding was not factual and that she would surrender herself to the court. After Ding obtained this letter, he applied to the High Court Second Branch for a retrial. The High Court had already summoned her once and ordered Shen Shuqing to post bail to be available for summons at any time. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. On the 2nd of this month, Shen Shuqing filed a surrender statement to the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Tang Peiyou opened the Eighth Criminal Court for investigation. Shen Shuqing and Yu Shangxun were both listed as persons under investigation, and Ding Jiasheng was also summoned to court to testify. Mr. Tang immediately interrogated Shen and Yu separately. According to Shen's confession, on October 6th of last year, when I went to the school to work, I discovered that several suits of Yu placed in the principal's office were missing. I then reported it to the police. At that time, Yu Shangxun and I were living together in the back room of No. 21 Duofu Lane, Tongfu Road. Around the Double Tenth Festival, I saw pawn tickets in Yu's wallet. Given Yu's circumstances, there was no need to pawn anything, so I asked him to take them out to look at them, but Yu refused. The day before Ding was arrested, Yu told me that the matter had been discovered and asked me to go upstairs to take a look. I then went upstairs and saw Ding Jiasheng's clothes box open. There were pawn tickets placed in the corner of the box. At that moment, teacher Zhu Bin of the same school suddenly entered. I then closed the box. Before the court hearing, Yu wrote a paper and instructed me to testify in court according to the paper. Now this paper has been brought to the case for inspection. She then presented the paper written by Yu to the court. As for whether Yu was actually stolen from and whether Ding was actually a thief, I dare not say for sure. However, when I was running the elementary school before, Ding was in charge of accounting and made no mistakes. I don't think he would do such a thing. When Yu Shangxun was questioned, he firmly stated that there was indeed a theft and that he did have a cohabitation relationship with Shen. However, Shen stated that regarding the cohabitation point, there was a second landlord who could testify. The court then summoned Ding Jiasheng to the court, questioned him, and Wang Zuzhen also came to court to prove everything. Prosecutor Tang verified the confessions and then ordered Shen Shuqing and Yu Shangxun to each post 100 yuan bail to await further investigation. Shen immediately stated that she had already posted bail in the High Court Second Branch. The court stated that the bail of the High Court Second Branch was irrelevant to this case and that she should find another bail immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Grocery Store Robbed on Haining Road; Robbers Flee but Are Captured; "Daredevil" Takes Melon Seeds to Go With His Drink, Fires Blank Shots to Signal Police and Is Surrounded <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>No. 82, Lane 514 (i.e., Bao'an Lane), Haining Road, also known as Jiangbei Lane, bordering Haining Road to the south and reaching North Jiangxi Road, Old Race Course Road to the north, at around 9:00 p.m. yesterday, a man with a Shandong accent wearing a white undershirt suddenly entered the Li-Sheng Cheng tobacco, wine and grocery store opened by a Ningbo man surnamed Du. He went to buy red dates, but because the store did not have them, the man bought melon seeds for three copper coins and poured himself a cup of wine, drinking alone at the store's counter. Unexpectedly, after only a few sips, eight or nine men with Shandong accents wearing blue and black jackets suddenly poured in, led by the man in the white undershirt, and rushed into the store. First, they shouted at the apprentices and the store owner's wife, and then showed their handguns, prohibiting them from moving. The cash register next to the counter was first opened, and more than thirty yuan in banknotes, silver coins, and small denomination bills were stolen. However, the bandits were still not satisfied, so three or four bandits went upstairs to search. As a result, the store owner's wife and others had seven gold rings and more than ten yuan in private savings stolen. Seeing that they had searched everything thoroughly, the bandits suddenly shouted and fled out the door with the stolen goods, heading north. However, at this time, the neighbors on both sides of the store had become aware of the situation. Seeing the bandits leaving, they also followed and chased after them. When they reached the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Race Course Road, they urgently called for the arrest of the bandits. Seeing that the matter had been exposed, the bandits became extremely anxious and fired three shots into the sky as a warning. Unexpectedly, this attracted the attention of detectives and police officers. As the gunshots subsided, a group of detectives and police officers arrived. Seeing that things were not going well, the bandits scattered and fled. Four of the bandits were surrounded by police officers and had no way to escape. They surrendered on the spot and were searched, finding a handgun, six bullets, and the original stolen goods. At the same time, two handguns with live ammunition that had been discarded by the bandits were also found by the roadside. They were all taken to the police station, temporarily detained, and are awaiting the arrest of the remaining accomplices and further investigation.</p>

<p>At around 5:00 p.m. yesterday, a young woman went to the Gongping Hotel at No. 237 Gongping Road to check in. She specified Room 27 for her stay and paid the room fee. She claimed to be named Yu Aiqing, 19 years old, and a local. After the tea server brought in tea, the woman closed the door, seemingly disliking the noise. Unexpectedly, at around 6:40 p.m., the tea server suddenly heard a moan coming from the room, which was very surprising. He quickly pushed the door open and saw the woman rolling on the side of the bed, her face pale. Next to the pillow was an empty bottle of poison. Knowing that she had committed suicide by taking poison, he quickly reported it to the police station, which dispatched a car to rush her to the Bazi Road Sanatorium for treatment. After the hospital gave her emergency treatment, there was no improvement in the evening, and her condition was very critical. However, she was briefly conscious in between. Under questioning by detectives, she claimed that she was born with only one eye. Although she was old enough to marry, she was not yet married. Because of this, she was hated by others, and numerous proposed marriages were blocked. Out of resentment, she committed suicide. Currently, the police station is trying to contact her family to handle the aftermath.</p>

<p>Lei Ziqin, manager of Lei Yunshang Songfentang Pharmacy in Suzhou, Shanghai, and father of Lei Weiming and the Liangxiang Three Gentlemen, was renowned in the Shanghai-Suzhou medical and pharmaceutical community.

<h3 id="e126">Lu Zhongwen and Ye Liang Invent Rotating Three-Way Light Bulb <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhongwen and Ye Liang have long had insights into the electrical appliance industry. Recently, they invented two types of three-way light bulbs. The special feature of Type A is that after being installed, to adjust the brightness, one only needs to press the bulb and rotate it slightly to change to three different levels of brightness. Type B bulbs have three filaments of the same brightness. If one filament breaks, the remaining two filaments can still be used successively, with the same brightness as before. These two types of light bulbs are tantamount to having the functions of three bulbs in one, saving a lot of money and being very easy to use. Moreover, the lamp holder can automatically turn on and off. One only needs to rotate the bulb slightly to automatically turn on and off, without the need to use a switch. The exterior is made of materials such as Chromy Bakelite, making it even more beautiful. After the invention, it was commended by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, and a five-year patent was granted. Currently, Chen Weizhou, a wealthy Cantonese merchant, has solely invested in the establishment of the Central Three-Way Light Bulb Factory to engage in manufacturing. The factory is located at No. 221 Rue Saussier in the French Concession and is actively preparing to launch products on the market soon.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Rickshaw Puller Honest and Not Deceitful; Japanese Resident Greatly Moved; Such Honesty is Rare in Society <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of April 19th, at around 10:00 a.m., a Japanese resident, taking advantage of the Sunday holiday, led his wife and four children to Paotaiwan, Wusong, for a visit. Upon disembarking at the Wusong station, a rickshaw puller (i.e., a goat cart) solicited business. The resident hired him, stating that he wanted to go to Paotaiwan and that the one-way fare was 20 cents. When the cart reached halfway, due to the unevenness of the road, the resident got off and gave the rickshaw puller one yuan (legal tender) to give him change. The rickshaw puller only had 60 cents on him. The resident took it and walked away with his wife and children. It was around noon. After he had spent all day wandering and chatting, it was already 6:00 p.m. when he returned to the station and saw the rickshaw puller waiting there. He had been waiting there for several hours and returned two dimes to the resident, stating that he did not have enough change at the time and repeatedly apologized, speaking in a humble and polite manner. The resident was greatly moved upon hearing this and intended to show his appreciation. As the train was about to depart, he hurriedly returned home. After thinking about it carefully at home, he thought that this rickshaw puller was an uneducated laborer, and that he was so honest was rare in society. Even Japanese people are not as good as him. In his ten years of living in Shanghai, he had never encountered one like him. So he thought he was moved and wrote a letter to the Japanese Consulate General, but he did not leave his name. The letter was as described above, with one yuan attached as a gift to be given to the rickshaw puller. According to the letter, the consulate general sent Inspector Kojiri Heikichi to the North Station Branch yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. to meet with Director Liang Fuqing, claiming that a Japanese resident had awarded a silver dollar to reward an honest rickshaw puller. The yuan was handed over to be given to the rickshaw puller. Director Liang immediately expressed his gratitude and reported the situation to the General Bureau, ordering the police station in the jurisdiction to investigate the name of the rickshaw puller and interrogate him.</p>

<p>A Cantonese woman, Wen Jian, 22 years old, living at No. 121, Lane 318, Tiantong Road, whose husband, Wen Ren, worked as a fireman on a British ship, had a daughter named Meimei, who was only three years old. Last spring, Wen Ren wrote to Ms. Wen from England, saying that he had another business and could not return home. For expenses, he would continue to send remittances to Shanghai. Heeding her mother's concerns, Wen would remit money to Ms. Wen every month to make a living. Unexpectedly, from January of this year, there was no news. Ms. Wen did not know where he was in England, and the address was unknown, so household expenses and rent were difficult to maintain. She was abnormally worried all day long. Recently, the second landlord repeatedly urged her to pay 15 yuan in arrears, and Ms. Wen could not raise the money. She suddenly had the idea of ending her life. At 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, she poured a small box of opium smoke left by her late uncle into the tea and secretly drank it with her three-year-old daughter, Meimei, with the intention of dying together. She moaned in bed due to the onset of poisoning, which was noticed by someone who notified the Hongkou Police by telephone. The police chief sent Cantonese detective Fang Youcheng to rush to the scene in an ambulance and sent Ms. Wen and her daughter to the Shanghai Sanatorium. The doctor tied them up and administered emetics to expel the smoke juice, which saved their lives. The police prosecuted Ms. Wen for attempted murder under Article 272, Section 2 of the Criminal Code for poisoning her daughter. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department described the case and asked to interrogate Ms. Wen, who bowed her head and shed tears, her expression pitiable, please consider. Judge Xiao Zhufen ordered her to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for the morning of the 13th. Her daughter, Wen Meimei, was temporarily sent to the Women and Children's Relief Society to be cared for.</p>
<p>Fish Market Executive Director Kui Yanfang Threatened and Extorted by Bandits: Initially Demanding 20,000 Yuan, Later Reduced to 8,000 Yuan; If Not Allowed, His Son Would Be Kidnapped - Detectives Arrested Sun Yuanlin and Zhou Xiangda</p>
<p>Kui Yanfang, manager of the Xin Yu Textile Company on Rue Robert and newly appointed executive director of the Industry Department's fish market, residing at No. 4, Lane 617, Seymour Road, had been receiving threatening letters from a bandit group claiming to be led by someone named Yue, starting from the 15th of last month until the day before yesterday. The letters were filled with strong language, accusing Kui of having amassed considerable wealth during his tenure as manager of the Xingye Bank. Yue claimed to be facing financial difficulties and requested a loan. The demanded sum was initially 20,000 yuan, later reduced to 8,000 yuan, to be delivered to the square table inside Lane 713 of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession (i.e., Songbin Villa) the night before last, where someone would collect it. If not allowed, Kui's son would be kidnapped. Kui reported the letters to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives along with French Concession detectives to Songbin Villa and its vicinity to lie in wait. Meanwhile, Kui wrote a reply, sending someone to place it on the square table in the lane. Unexpectedly, the Chinese and Western detectives, after waiting from 7:00 PM until 11:00 PM last night, did not see any bandits. Only Sun Yuanlin, a Jiangbei native who managed the lane's gate, was seen wandering around the lane several times, behaving suspiciously. Sun was arrested, and ten envelopes were found in his gatehouse, matching the envelopes of the threatening letters received by Kui, along with a piece of rubber. Based on Sun's confession, Zhou Xiangda, from Changzhou, was apprehended at No. 3 in the same lane, and a fountain pen and a bottle of ink were confiscated. Both were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, described the circumstances of the arrest, stating that Sun Yuanlin had confessed to participating in the discussion of the matter at the police station, and Zhou Xiangda had also admitted to writing the five threatening letters himself, with Sun initiating the idea. However, the victim, Kui Yanfang, was unable to attend due to attending the opening ceremony of the fish market and requested a postponement. Questioned about Sun Yuanlin, his confession stated that he did not know who wrote the threatening letters, and the envelopes found at his place were obtained from the accounting room. Zhou Xiangda testified that he was a coppersmith at the waterworks company, and Sun lived at No. 3 Songbin Villa on Avenue Joffre during the day, while he stayed there at night. He denied writing the threatening letters, stating that his handwriting could be compared. He also stated that he had gone to Kui Yanfang's house on Rue West Elmhurst to repair a water leak once, and now he did not know where Kui had moved to. As for the fountain pen and ink found at his place, they belonged to Sun Yuanlin, so he was being framed by Sun. Judge Tan Xinzhen reviewed the confessions and ordered Sun and Zhou to be remanded in custody, pending rescheduling for further questioning.</p>

<p>Since the Huasheng, Huatong, and Yapu Er factories have worked hard to manufacture electric fans, it has been more than 20 years. Their products are no less superior than imported goods, and they are quite popular among Chinese people. As a result, foreign electric fans have gradually been phased out. This year, foreign merchants are trying to revive their business by planning to manufacture in Shanghai, reducing costs by importing various parts separately to lower tariffs and replace our country's electric fans. According to Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the Electric Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association, the summer season is approaching, and foreign merchants have actively prepared 5,000 electric fans to dump on the market in an attempt to seize the domestic market. I have joined forces with Huasheng and Huatong to organize a joint market, preparing 40,000 high-quality electric fans to compete. In order to promote the purchase and use by the people and prevent the outflow of national funds, we have drastically reduced costs and requested the Party and government agencies to jointly promote it, in order to prevent leakage.</p>

<h3 id="e144">A Visit to the China Oil Lamp Company Manufacturing Factory <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Rong</p>
<p>Foreword Kerosene, commonly known as foreign oil, is a necessity for lighting in our country, and imports account for about 100 million yuan annually. The huge leakage is truly alarming. In the past, before foreign oil was imported, oil lamps used vegetable seed oil, such as soybean, sesame, cottonseed, and peanut oil. However, old-fashioned oil lamps were inflexible and did not improve, resulting in dim light and inconvenience. With the rise of foreign oil lamps, they were completely eliminated. As a result, the annual revenue of foreign oil has reached one-fifth of the total import surplus. Mr. Zhong Ling, the inventor of the Zhong Ling printing press, aware of this, has been researching for several years and recently created a pressure oil lamp. Using the principle of pressure, vegetable seed oil is used to light the lamp, which is bright and convenient, similar to commercially available foreign oil lamps (i.e., commonly known as Mobil lamps), and safer and more hygienic. It has now been specially patented for five years by the Ministry of Industry and is being promoted for adoption across provinces and cities. The future development is very promising. Various domestic vegetable seed oils can be used as fuel for this oil lamp. Once promoted, it can not only stop the huge outflow, but also increase the equivalent value of agricultural products, which is truly beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. In addition, since China currently does not produce kerosene, if international warfare occurs, the source will be cut off, and what will happen to the lights of thousands of homes? Therefore, from the perspective of national defense, it is of great significance. At the request of a certain bank, the author accepted the invitation of Mr. Chen Zuyi and Mr. Yao Shou Kang of the company to visit on May 6. The content of the factory is recorded on the left for reference by those who care about emerging national industrial goods.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Situation In addition to the distribution office at No. 128 Shandong Road, the company also has a manufacturing factory located in Hongyunfang, Huade Road. Although small in scale, the layout is neat. The manufacturing process can be divided into four steps: rolling and cutting, assembling, welding, and finishing. The style of the pressure oil lamp (see photo) is different from that of foreign oil lamps. The biggest difference is that the oil reservoir is located on the side and top of the lamp head, so the oil level is higher than the lamp head. This is because vegetable oil has a greater viscosity and cannot rise from the wick by capillary action like foreign oil. It must be guided by the oil surface pressure higher than the lamp head. At the same time, in order to prevent the lamp oil from overflowing due to pressure, there is another iron pipe welded to the oil inlet, which reaches the bottom of the container. In this way, when oil is injected into the lamp, the upper part of the oil surface is isolated from the outside, and the pressure remains unchanged until the wick is lit, and then it gradually decreases. The manufacturing raw material is tinplate, which is first rolled into various parts of the oil lamp by a rolling machine, then assembled, welded with tin, and then finished and tested before packaging and sales. There are many types of oil lamps currently produced by the factory. In addition to iron, there are also several types of glass, which are supervised by a certain glass factory in Pudong that manufactures lampshades. In addition, a branch factory has been established in Laobeikai, Tianjin, North China, specializing in the manufacture of hand-held storm lanterns, which will soon be available on the market.</p>
<p>Business Situation The factory currently produces 2,000 oil lamps per day, with prices ranging from 50 cents to 65 cents per lamp. Sales are strongest in provinces such as Sichuan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Shandong. According to Mr. Zhong to the author, in Sichuan alone, the current monthly demand is 50,000 lamps, almost equal to the factory's current production capacity, so they are working day and night. This is because foreign oil is transported to Sichuan by land or sea, and the freight is 15 cents per catty, almost double the original price, while the price of local soybean oil is only about 20 cents, so it is very suitable to use pressure oil lamps. In addition, Governor Xiong of Jiangxi Province is actively promoting this oil lamp and plans to organize a provincial oil lamp sales cooperative to specialize in the transportation and sales of pressure oil lamps. In addition, because this oil lamp is safe and odorless, silkworm farmers and seed farms in areas such as Suzhou and Wuxi are also sending letters to order them.</p>
<p>Future Plans In addition to deciding to expand equipment and increase daily production to 10,000 lamps, the factory is also researching the oil problem. A type of flax with abundant oil and easy cultivation has been selected and is being tested in various areas of Zhejiang. It is estimated that the cost of oil will only be about 7 cents per catty, which is two-thirds cheaper than soybean oil. It has a bitter taste and is pure, making it most suitable for lamps. Once the trial planting is successful this year, it is planned to promote planting in various provinces. If this is the case, costs will be reduced, and the public will be more willing to adopt it.</p>

<p>— (Ba Ling)</p>
<p>It is said that May is a poisonous month, an ominous month. Because in May, there are really too many painful anniversaries! Are May 3rd, May 9th, and May 30th not national humiliation anniversaries that make people feel exceptionally indignant? We certainly cannot criticize the person who said this, but the words inevitably have some negative and decadent tones, which is really not what should be said in the current situation of such heavy national difficulties.</p>
<p>In my opinion, instead of saying that the sorrowful May is a poisonous month or an ominous month, it would be more realistic and inspiring to say that it is a month of revolution and struggle.</p>
<p>We know that the will of young people should be enterprising and forward-looking. Negative concepts and decadent attitudes are not only useless, but also not good for oneself. In our life of hardship, we can only open a way out with a brave and enterprising spirit. How can dealing with national difficulties escape this truth?</p>
<p>Therefore, although the sorrowful May has arrived, compatriots should not be pessimistic or negative. Everyone should be encouraged by the will to live, stand on the same front, and move forward on this path to save the country. That is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>— Da Qian</p>
<p>——The Giant of Today——</p>
<p>In Alton, Illinois, USA, there is a boy named Robert Pershing Wadlow, currently eighteen years old. He is eight feet, four and a half inches tall and weighs 395 pounds, making him the tallest child in the world today. His parents are alive and well, and he has four siblings, all of average height. At birth, the boy weighed eight and a half pounds, not much different from a normal child. However, several years later, the pituitary gland at the base of his brain, responsible for growth, suddenly became abnormally developed, growing to the size of a walnut. By the age of five, he was already over five feet tall, similar in height to an average person. At fifteen, he was seven feet, eight and a half inches tall. In recent years, he has grown an average of three inches and gained eighteen and a half pounds each year. If this continues, he could reach over nine feet by the age of twenty-one. Currently, the tallest man in the United States is Jack Earle, a lawyer from El Paso, Texas, who is eight feet, six inches tall, but he will soon be overshadowed! If we calculate based on the male growth period extending to age thirty-five, the boy could reach over twelve feet in height, undoubtedly breaking all records for tall people.</p>
<p>As the giant child's height increases, his appetite naturally becomes much greater than that of an average person. His mother often prepares food equivalent to the portions for four people for him. For breakfast alone, he needs a box of cereal (about one pound), a quarter gallon of orange juice (about one and a half Chinese pints), eight eggs, twelve slices of toast, an eighth gallon of apple juice, and five large cups of coffee, yet the giant child often seems unsatisfied. One day, he went to a coffee vendor and agreed to pay for as much coffee as he could drink. The vendor, calculating generously, charged him twenty-five cents (in the United States, coffee is usually five cents a cup, and each cup is very large, about the size of more than one medium bowl in China). The boy immediately paid and drank seventeen cups in one go, leaving the vendor to quietly lament his misfortune.</p>
<p>Due to his height and size, the giant child experiences inconvenience everywhere, like an adult using kindergarten furniture, unable to find a comfortable position. He often has to lower his head when entering doorways, developing a habit of stooping when entering a house. His family also struggles to cope with this giant child. One of the most challenging things is the shoes he wears, as they not only need to be large but also made of particularly sturdy materials and construction, otherwise they would not be able to withstand the great pressure of three to four hundred pounds and would soon break. Fortunately, a large shoe store, out of curiosity, uses it as an advertising opportunity and volunteers to provide the giant child with shoes. In addition to carefully selecting particularly sturdy materials, they also add metal bands. The shoes are one foot, six and a half inches long and one foot wide, costing $200 US dollars (over 600 Chinese dollars), which can be said to be an astonishing amount. His bed is also custom-made. Three years ago, a bed company, out of curiosity, volunteered to make a bed for him as a gift, measuring eight feet, one inch long. Everyone thought it would last him a lifetime, but who knew that today the giant child can no longer stretch out his legs on the bed! His family had no choice but to commission another custom-made bed, nine and a half feet long, still fearing that it may not last him a lifetime. The child recently graduated from high school with excellent grades, earning an honorarium. Could his intellectual abilities also be proportional to his physical size?</p>

<p>— Lei Lei</p>
<p>The "Ice Yard" is a temporary business venue operating near the Songhua River during the winter and spring seasons. It has everything: a counter, a signboard, shelves, and all other exquisite equipment. Therefore, the shops in the Ice Yard are no different from those on land.</p>
<p>The "yard" is built on "ice." When the Songhua River freezes into very thick ice, merchants insert firewood into the ice and pour warm water where the wood meets the ice. The firewood then freezes into the ice. Then, they use wooden boards to form squares and cover the top with boards. In this way, a complete and perfect "Ice Yard" is created.</p>
<p>After the Ice Yard is completed, merchants transport various goods to the Ice Yard to sell. During the day, the liveliness of the Ice Yard is not much different from the City God Temple in Shanghai. Therefore, when the cold winter arrives, the sound of "going to the Ice Yard to buy ××" fills the Songhua River all day long.</p>

<p>Chapter One: Sipping Tea and Engaging in Light Conversation by the Night Window, Listening to the Rain; Plucking a Branch, Admiring the Flower's Shadow in the Fragrant Alley</p>
<p>It was still early, so taking advantage of the clear weather, he decided to visit Zhongshan first to give him a heads-up for their outing that afternoon, ensuring he wouldn't miss him. With this thought in mind, he lowered his head as he walked, slowing his pace considerably. Fortunately, he was familiar with the way to Xiang Ping's house, so he didn't need to pay much attention and wouldn't get lost. Suddenly, he heard laughter, sounding extremely joyful. Looking up, he saw that half of an apricot tree, in someone's yard, extended over a white wall, with one branch leaning out. A child had placed a stool against the wall, reaching out to grab a flower branch, while two other children clapped and laughed below. Guoqi saw that the apricot tree was in full bloom, and as the children laughed and played, he put his hands behind his back and stood on one side of the alley, watching. At that moment, a young woman dressed as a student, with a white bamboo cloth satchel under her arm, turned from the other end of the alley. A fringe of hair on her forehead was slightly tousled. She wore a fitted, knee-length plaid cloth jacket, and a glossy black braid, five inches long, swayed on her hem. Under her right arm, a long white handkerchief was tucked between the buttons. This was a common female student's attire at the time. However, there wasn't a single stain or wrinkle on the woman's clothes. Even her black velvet flat-bottomed shoes and white cotton socks were distinctly black and white, without any smudges. Guoqi's school was near a girls' school, and he often encountered female students going to and fro. Guoqi was a cautious and reserved young man, with a thin skin, and would blush whenever he saw a woman. So, although he saw many female students every day, he had never really looked at them properly. At this moment, for some reason, he felt a kind of attraction from this girl, holding his gaze and preventing him from looking away. She slowly walked closer, but was blocked by the children picking flowers. She stopped and looked up at the flowers on the wall. Although Guoqi was on the other side of the alley, facing the wall, watching, because she raised her face to look at the flowers, she could also see his face. He was already attracted to her figure. Now, seeing her face, his soul was simply intoxicated. She had such white and delicate skin, an oval face, eyes like black lacquer surrounded by long eyelashes, a slightly high nose, and lips like cherries, exactly like the idol Venus. It was simply the beauty he had always dreamed of. How could such a thing happen? Could fantasy really become reality? His eyes looked at the apricot blossoms on the wall, and he couldn't help but feel amazed. The female student, although looking at the apricot blossoms, seemed intentionally, or perhaps unintentionally, to be constantly glancing at Guoqi.</p>

<p>— (Moni)</p>
<p>At night, in the deep night, darkness envelops the entire earth. Tall buildings stand in silent solemnity, as if asleep. It is not as lively as during the day. Cars rarely drive on the dying-like Third Horse Road. Only the dim yellow streetlights and blood-red neon signs emit different colors of light.</p>
<p>Hawkers carrying rice bundles and "goddesses" selling their souls and flesh begin to operate at the intersection of Zhejiang Road. Standing in the biting cold wind, many people on the brink of starvation huddle around steaming rice bundles. The "goddesses," however, harbor unspeakable pain as they scrutinize every passerby, some grabbing and saying vulgar things to entice lonely men. This is a place I pass by every night, and I inevitably see this street scene.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Every Year, the Third Month Festival <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>A thin and lanky woman, with a withered face and disheveled hair like a ghost, wore a very worn-out cheongsam, with several buttons missing. She seemed to have an addiction, and a half-smoked cigarette was held between her fingers. Two children, almost the same height, stood beside her. When she sang in a sharp, crisp voice, the two children also sang along in a disjointed, childish way. They were on the sidewalk at the corner of the tobacco shop.</p>
<p>I hadn't noticed it a few days ago, only feeling the sharp, crisp singing reverberating in the dark atmosphere, which was very desolate and quite capable of evoking people's feelings. Later, I paid attention.</p>
<p>The tobacco shop at the corner is open all night, and there are people who specialize in working the night shift. I often buy cigarettes at this shop, so I'm somewhat familiar with them. So, I took the opportunity to buy cigarettes and asked about the singer.</p>
<p>According to him, she and her two children have been coming for a week and only leave with her two children when it's about to dawn. She sings, but unlike beggars who follow people and pester them for money, she never asks anyone for money. Sometimes, when she's tired of singing, she takes a drag of her cigarette, seemingly lost in thought in the biting cold wind. Also, no one has ever been seen giving her a single penny.</p>
<p>Last night, the sharp, crisp singing reverberated in the silent air, so desolate and plaintive. The two children also sang along in a disjointed, childish way!</p>
<p>Perhaps they are the most pitiful people in the world!</p>

<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>I followed the [section missing] on an inspection tour, which lasted for a month and covered six provinces. The scenery and historical sites encountered were enough to feast the eyes. In my spare time, I often felt inspired to write poetry. The lines may be colloquial and crude, but they are also for remembrance.</p>
<p>Visiting Wuhua Mountain in Kunming</p>
<p>Don't say that beauty has a short life. A weak ruler and mediocre officials failed to defend the pass. The hooves of barbarian horses are high, and the spring grass is green. The Jinniu Road is narrow, and embroidered shoes are bent. Men have already suffered the fate of the Wu Palace. How could the woman know the hardships of the Han people? A generation of brilliant minds was wasted. The clouds obscure the room, and the cold moon reflects her delicate hair.</p>
<p>Feelings on the Cuiwei Pavilion in Zhucheng (Following the Rhyme of Ruan Wenda's Poem on Cuiwei Pavilion)</p>
<p>After lingering outside the Cuiwei Pavilion, a sense of desolation remains unforgettable. The sound of the flute still lingers in the sunset, but there is no literary talent to accompany the passing of spring. The sound of Buddhist chants makes one's thoughts travel far. Mountain birds call out, urging one to pass the day. What is most unbearable is the incessant cawing of the crows, asking me what I am doing in Qianyang.</p>
<p>Scene from the Wu Gorge</p>
<p>The water rushes, and the cliffs rise to Wu Mountain. A line of the Yangtze River winds through the gorge. Several unusual peaks welcome the departing travelers. The green mountains escort the painting into the heart.</p>
<p>There is no stealing. Listening to the sound of the water, clear and distinct. How much beauty lies in the gorge? The moonlit night makes one feel even more affection for this place.</p>
<p>The shadows of the Twelve Wu Peaks are also beautiful. Graceful jade maidens embrace the riverbank. The King of Chu did not cherish his dream of the Yangtai Palace, leaving it to poets to create tales.</p>
<p>Thoughts on First Flight</p>
<p>In an instant, thousands of miles of rivers and mountains are traversed. White clouds and the vast sea flow before my eyes. Danger and ease are inherent in the heart. Heavenly principles still require human effort.</p>

<h3 id="e152">First Time Watching Bang Bang Opera <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>The first time I went to see Bang Bang opera was during the day, but it was a wasted trip. The theater staff told me that there were only matinee performances on Saturdays and Sundays, or other "sealed pass" days, and only evening performances on other weekdays. So, I came back.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I didn't forget about it and went again very solemnly because I believe that all kinds of local dramas have their value, so I must go and see them.</p>
<p>That day, I didn't care which play was being performed; I could see any of them. As it happened, they were performing "Pan Jinlian." Because I arrived a little late, I couldn't get a good seat and had to sit in the last row of the special hall, near the side.</p>
<p>Pan Jinlian has a position in Chinese literature, so wait and see.</p>
<p>After a while, the opening gong and drum sounded, which was no different from Beijing opera, except they used one side drum.</p>
<p>All the percussion instruments are also the same as in Beijing opera, except for a "bangzi," which is a round strip of hardwood, more than an inch in diameter and five or six inches long, struck with another wooden mallet. The sound is extremely loud. This is a unique percussion instrument in Shaanxi Bangzi opera. In addition to the jinghu, there is a erhu, but the main instrument is the bangzi huqin. The shape of the bangzi huqin is similar to that of the erhu, but the sound box is not long and round but flat and round, like a small drum. The drum surface is not covered with snakeskin but with paulownia wood (the sound boxes of Guangdong violins are also made of wood). The neck of the instrument extends straight out to the bottom of the drum so that the player can clamp it between their knees to allow the hand pressing the strings to slide up and down. Because the fingers have to slide up and down the strings, the first joint of the fingers is covered with a ring-shaped leather sheath to prevent the tense strings from cutting the skin. These two instruments are unique to Bangzi opera. I had seen them when Bangzi opera was popular in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The singing style is similar to Bangzi opera, but it doesn't seem as high-pitched and tragic, and it seems simpler. However, sometimes it includes some pihuang. For example, that day, the actor playing Wu Song sang in the pihuang style. Popular tunes and ditties are also freely mixed in.</p>
<p>From a musical point of view, the music of Bang Bang opera is not very sophisticated (but there is potential for improvement). However, it has one advantage: when the actor sings, the instruments are plucked and strummed lightly, randomly and unintentionally accompanying the singing, so the melody and phrases of the song are not obscured by the loud sounds of the instruments. Only when the interlude comes do the instruments play more boldly. This is a commendable advantage.</p>
<p>It tells a story from beginning to end, just like Cantonese opera. The audience's attention is consistent. The important pillars of the cast play from the beginning to the end, which is quite strenuous. If Beijing opera can be considered a short story, then Bang Bang opera is a novel.</p>
<p>There is little singing throughout the play, and the dialogue is clear, so the audience can easily understand it. All the dialogue is also quite concise.</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang's pronunciation is really good. The resonance rate of her vocal apparatus is rare. She speaks so softly and deeply, without any effort, and the audience below finds that her voice is clearer than that of any other actor who is speaking with effort. This is a kind of sound I have never heard before.</p>
<p>There is no set, and the props on stage seem a little too casual.</p>

<h3 id="e155">President Dai Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; To Depart for Germany on the 20th; Wang Zhengting to Travel on a Different Ship; Zhang Zhijiang and Chu Minyi Arrived in Shanghai Together by Train <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, was appointed as our representative to the World Games and is scheduled to depart for Germany on the 20th of this month on the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Gneisenau." Dai, along with Zhang Zhijiang, director of the Central Guoshu Institute, and Chu Minyi, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing yesterday morning. At around 9:00 AM, they went to Shen Garden on Yanping Road to participate in the World Games Guoshu preliminary competition. The statements made by Dai and Zhang to a reporter from Guoguang News Agency are listed below:</p>
<p>President Dai Talks About Attending the World Games</p>
<p>According to Dai's statement to a reporter from Guoguang News Agency, he was ordered to attend the World Games in Germany as a government representative and is scheduled to depart on the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Gneisenau" on the 20th of this month. His secretary, Ding Wenyuan, will accompany him. Although Dr. Wang Zhengting, the leader of our country's World Games team, will also depart on the same day, Wang will travel on the Changxing Company's Canadian Empress ship to America and then to Germany, so they will not be on the same ship. He stated that he was participating in the World Games representing the government, but he had no in-depth knowledge of sports, so he could only say that he was there to learn and work and had no specific opinions.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang Talks About Promoting Guoshu</p>
<p>According to Zhang Zhijiang, he came to Shanghai with President Dai to participate in the preliminary Guoshu and weightlifting events of the World Games and to serve as a judge. He also planned to take the opportunity to see Dai off. He said that Guoshu in our country definitely had its unique advantages in sports. He and the Nanyang Touring Group of the Central Guoshu Institute previously performed in various places in Nanyang and were well-received by the overseas Chinese. He predicted that participating in the World Games this time would allow people around the world to recognize and promote Guoshu.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Special Dispatch from the Shen Bao: Hong Kong-Shanghai Route <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>Sent from Hong Kong, May 5th</p>
<p>The clamorous noise like that of a small vegetable market, mixed with the sound of gongs urging passengers to leave the ship, the kisses of French men and women bidding farewell, quite charming, the passageways for entry and exit piled with green hair and red clothes, shoulder to shoulder, heel to heel, bustling and chaotic—this was the intense impression given to people in the fifteen minutes before the French mail ship "Aramis" was about to set sail at four o'clock in the afternoon on May 2nd. We, the members of the World Games football team, were also a part of the passengers on board. Our relatives, who cared for us so much, walked us a long way off, filling us with gratitude. After the gongs urged us to shake hands, the send-offs all stood on the dock, holding colored paper streamers, as if representing boundless tenderness, wanting to continue but having to stop, waving their hands and hats, a little sad. "The most difficult thing in the world is separation." Those who have tasted the bitterness of parting understand it. It is difficult for my bald pen to describe it. We leaned on the ship's railing until the figures on the shore became blurred before returning to our cabins to settle our luggage. There were a total of twenty of us who were to board the ship in Shanghai, including Director Dr. Rong Qizhao, Coach Yan Chengkun, and players Li Huitang, Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, Liang Rongzhao, Huang Meishun, Li Guowei, Chen Zhenhe, Liang Shutang, Cao Guicheng, Yang Shuiyi, Jia Youliang, Sun Jinshun, Feng Jingxiang, Zhuo Shijin, Zheng Jiliang, Zhang Xianyuan, and Ye Beihua.</p>
<p>There was also the administrator Huang Jiajun, and players Huang Jiliang, Xu Yahui, and Mai Shaohan, who would depart together in Hong Kong. Our Singaporean teammate Cai Wenli is waiting in Singapore to rejoin the team.</p>
<p>The French mail ship we are on is the newest type of passenger ship, but it has many unsatisfactory aspects. If we didn't have to go to Saigon for the competition, we really wouldn't be passengers on this ship. When we go to foreign restaurants, we often see "Famous French Chef" as a selling point, but in reality, French cuisine is extremely poor. Apart from the French, no one on the ship doesn't complain that the food is not delicious. The monotonous breakfast makes people not want to eat, but they have to. Lunch and dinner are just fish and meat. We cannot work on an empty stomach, so we have to eat more bread without butter. We estimate that if we continue to eat like this, by the time we land in Singapore, everyone's weight will have decreased by ten pounds. How bitter! Also, the French have a stubbornness; they are unwilling to speak English. Even if you speak to them, they don't understand much. Thus, there is incompatibility, jokes, and misunderstandings every day. It is not convenient for the passengers at all. I secretly disapprove of this for the future of their business. During the voyage, we only rested fully and nursed our injuries, without doing any training, because we all really felt overly tired. There are still many competitions ahead, so we must rest and recuperate first to prepare for the future. Fortunately, this voyage is smooth, and even those most unaccustomed to sea travel can move freely, sleep and eat comfortably without suffering. We must thank the generous gift of the Dragon Palace's master. On the ship, our team held one meeting. Director Rong, Coach Yan, and I all sincerely spoke some honest words about the team's shared fate and harmony. In addition, we set specific times for rising early and sleeping late, asking everyone to strictly abide by them. The division of labor and management of all large and small matters in the team will be determined after Administrator Huang Jiajun joins us. This Hong Kong-Shanghai route took a total of sixty-two hours from departure to arrival, which is much slower than other mail ships. When the ship arrived along the Fuzhou coast, the weather had gradually become hot. We had removed the protection of woolen sweaters and put on summer clothes. We entered the port on the morning of the 5th. Many family members and friends came to welcome us. The boat will continue its southward voyage at four o'clock the same day.</p>

<p>The preliminary selection for China's national arts and weightlifting for the World Games was held yesterday morning starting at nine o'clock at the Shen Garden gymnasium. Mr. Dai Chuanxian, the Chinese government's representative for the World Games, also attended the venue in the morning to oversee the selection. He returned to his private residence to rest after the selection was completed at noon. The judges who officiated yesterday were Chu Minyi, Zhang Zhijiang, Xu Zhiyi, Hua Liang, Hao Ming, and Tong Zhongyi. After the selection was completed, a judging meeting was held in the office of the Sports Association. Yesterday's weightlifting results all broke national records. However, because the scores have not yet been calculated, the list of selected candidates will be officially announced this afternoon. Both the preliminary and final selections have been completed. The final selection, originally scheduled for the 14th, has been canceled. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Weightlifting in All Divisions Breaks National Records</p>
<p>The weightlifting selection began yesterday morning, with Mr. Zhou Jiaqi serving as the referee. The event was divided into five weight classes: light, secondary, middle, heavy, and secondary heavy. Due to rain yesterday, the event was moved indoors. Because the floor was too soft and could not bear the weight, the results were affected. Malayan athlete Huang Sheji (weight 133 pounds) fell to the ground and injured his wrist when the barbell lost its balance at 252 kilograms. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, he recovered in the afternoon. Since participating in last year's National Games, the results of weightlifting athletes from various regions have improved rapidly. Yesterday's results in all divisions broke national records. The results of yesterday's event and the highest national records are listed below for comparison (however, the middleweight division still has a problem and will be re-contested at Shen Garden at ten o'clock this morning):</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>National Records</p>
<p>National Arts Performances Were Beautiful and Captivating</p>
<p>A total of twenty-five athletes from various provinces and cities participated in the national arts performances, including six women. Each of the athletes who participated yesterday performed a variety of "bullet fist" techniques, as well as broadswords, spears, swords, soft whips, and three-section staffs. All of the athletes were ambitious and showed off their skills. In particular, Shanghai athlete Zheng Huaixian's flying fork technique, with its unique upper and lower body coordination, received the most applause from the audience. Meng Jianli's national arts and Henan Province's Liu Yuhua's swordsmanship were also very skilled. The national arts performances began at 9:30 AM and ended completely at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Judging Results to be Announced Today</p>
<p>After the selection was completed, the judges held a judging meeting at 4:10 PM in the office of the Sports Association. Those who participated included Chu Minyi, Zhang Zhijiang, Shen Siliang, Xu Zhiyi, Ye Liang, Tong Zhongyi, and Hao Ming. According to Mr. Chu's statement to a Guoguang News Agency reporter after the meeting, the results were not yet calculated today and will be officially announced tomorrow (i.e., today) afternoon. The final selection, originally scheduled for the 14th, has been canceled due to concerns that it would take up too much of the athletes' time. Both the preliminary and final selections were held completely today. However, there is still a problem with the middleweight weightlifting event, which will be re-contested at Shen Garden at 10:00 AM tomorrow (today).</p>

<p>In recent years, under the practical promotion of the central government, the sports industry has made rapid progress. Track and field is a central subject of physical education and is essential for forging physical fitness. There have been many track and field talents in our country in the past, scattered in various provinces and cities. There is no detailed record of their origin, family history, training process, and performance. This often makes it difficult for those who are enthusiastic about sports and those who are engaged in sports to examine it. The diligent bookshop at No. 277, Fourth Malu Road, Shanghai, has taken this into account and published a book called "National Men's Track and Field Stars Record". The book is rich in content and beautifully printed. It specially publishes photos of national track and field stars and attaches a short biography to each. The biography provides special details about their origin, family history, training, experience, and performance. With a turn of the page, it is easy to examine the "national steed" as if you know it in the palm of your hand. It also includes a list of the names of our country's track and field selections for each Far Eastern Games and a chronicle of major events in China's track and field world over the past twenty-six years, which are also valuable for reference. The price per copy is 30 cents of silver. To give preferential treatment to readers and to lighten the burden, it is priced at 20 cents. For mail orders, add 4 cents postage per copy.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The Ministry of Education, considering that the central government has planned to organize training classes for unemployed university graduates from the past two years during this summer vacation, sent a circular on the 11th to all public and private colleges and universities above the specialized level, urging them to promptly, in accordance with previous orders, ascertain the situation of the unemployed and report it to the Ministry so as to determine concrete relief measures.</p>

One type of textbook for both urban and rural areas has already been compiled, and 50 supplementary readers attached to each book have been compiled, which will be printed using the phonetic characters promulgated by the Ministry, and words will be linked together according to their parts of speech. After they are submitted to the Ministry of Education by the National Language Association for approval, they can be distributed. Furthermore, because the phonetic character typefaces cast by the Ministry of Education, with more than 5,000 characters of size 3, have been distributed to Beiping, the association is conducting publishing cooperation with people's education organizations, such as the Dingxian People's Education Association, to promote the use of phonetic characters.</p>

<p>—President Dai's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>President Dai of the Examination Yuan will go abroad soon to attend the World Games in Germany on behalf of the central government. In order to widely promote the government and promote the spirit of sports, he gave a radio speech to the country on the evening of the 8th at 8:30 PM at the Central Radio Station on the topic of "The Basic Principles of National Salvation Education." Here is a record of his speech in the original text:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, tonight, I, your brother, come to the Central Radio Station to give you a lecture on "The Basic Principles of National Salvation Education." What are the basic principles of national salvation education? We know that there are several reasons for the decline of the Chinese nation, one of which is the regression of education and the failure of education. Our Premier Sun Yat-sen has said that the principle of revolution to save the country is to focus on education first. When Premier Sun was in his twenties, he wrote an article in which he said, "If education is proper, there will be no wasted talent. If encouragement is appropriate, there will be no suppressed scholars. If employment is proper, there will be no lucky opportunists." This means that education is the foundation of nation-building and national salvation. Therefore, to create a great revolutionary cause, it is necessary to have revolutionary education first. What is the reason for China's past decline? It is that the bodies and minds of the Chinese people are too unhealthy. This has been going on for a long time, not just in the last few hundred years, but probably for more than a thousand years. But the ancient civilization of China gradually improved and created the most glorious culture in the world. What is the reason for this? This is because ancient Chinese education had a special feature, that is, "equal emphasis on skill and virtue, dual cultivation of literary and martial arts." Skill is the way to deal with people and the world, that is, the way to behave in the world. Virtue is doctrine, that is, morality. A person should have doctrine and morality, and should also have a way to deal with people and the world. Therefore, we should emphasize both skill and virtue. This is a special point of ancient Chinese education. In addition, a person should always cultivate literary skills and should also practice martial arts. He should cultivate both literary and martial arts in order to make his body and mind healthy. This is another special point of ancient Chinese education. Unfortunately, later, those who talked about doctrine did not talk about methods, those who talked about methods did not talk about doctrine, those who practiced martial arts did not cultivate literary skills, and those who cultivated literary skills did not practice martial arts. As a result, the bodies and minds of the Chinese people became unhealthy, like one leg missing, and naturally could not walk. People with learning and morality did not talk about technology and martial arts, and naturally could not cope with changes in China. China has been repeatedly defeated by foreign races for this reason. Therefore, to determine the basic principles of national salvation education now, we must restore the inherent educational principles of ancient times, that is, "equal emphasis on skill and virtue, dual cultivation of literary and martial arts." The declaration of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang last year has ten guidelines: 1. Base morality to correct people's hearts; 2. Promote practical learning to lay the foundation of the country; 3. Promote education to cultivate people's strength. These three articles are all about education, and there is a paragraph in the third article, "Literary education and martial education should originate from the same spirit, and in the basic training of the people, both should be equally emphasized in order to restore our country's inherent good rules and respond to the modern country's emphasis on martial arts and martial virtue in order to cultivate the habit of national group life, the education of sound national bodies and minds, the cultivation of the basis of social organization, and the creation of the strength for national independence and freedom." The seventh item, "Promote social education and adult literacy education with a consistent and comprehensive approach to education, cultivation, and hygiene, communicate the relationship between politics and education, and cultivate the ability of the people to save themselves and save the country." Generally speaking, the third article is to handle education under the principle of "equal emphasis on skill and virtue, dual cultivation of literary and martial arts." We must restore the inherent good rules, good methods, and good systems of China. Looking at the actual situation in recent decades, it really should be so. As long as people over the age of thirty can know the disadvantages of not emphasizing both skill and virtue and not cultivating both literary and martial arts.</p>
<p>I can give an example to illustrate that all the warriors in the late Qing Dynasty did not cultivate literary skills, the officers leading the troops did not read books, and the soldiers were illiterate. These soldiers and these officers could not only fail to maintain the independence and interests of the country externally, but also fail to maintain social order internally and protect the lives and property of the people, and disturb the people everywhere. One more soldier means one more harm. This is because the soldiers and generals at that time had military education but no literary education. This shows the harm of not cultivating both literary and martial arts in the late Qing Dynasty. Later, they wanted to reform, so they implemented military national education. Military matters were discussed in literary schools, and people studying literary skills also went to military schools. However, many soldiers at that time still could not defend the country and protect the people because they did not emphasize both skill and virtue, and had no doctrine. That is, the military force had no foundation. Having skill without virtue will naturally produce bad results.</p>

<p>Short Positions Overcrowded; Large Investors Eager to Buy</p>
<p>Brief Midday Dip: Ultimately, a Gain of $2.40</p>
<p>Yesterday’s gold market saw overcrowded short positions and eager buying from large investors. The Central Bank continued to open spot trades, gradually pushing prices higher. However, due to profit-taking by sellers, the market ultimately hovered. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw the London market shrink and the New York market halt. The forward silver price in Montreux contracted by between 1.5 and 2.4 cents. Exchange rates had already begun to decline. London spot gold also fell by three pence.

After the opening, large investors bought heavily, resulting in a firm trend. Gradually, prices rose. Large short sellers also covered their positions, causing short covering panic and a sudden bullish trend. The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank announced exchange rates that were unchanged for both British and American currencies, and the silver equalization tax shrank by 75. At this point, sellers took advantage of the situation, causing a temporary pullback. However, buying interest remained strong in the market, with some saying that the Central Bank opened spot purchases of 420 bars at a price of $33. Market sentiment turned positive, and longs took the opportunity to add to their positions, pushing the price up to $35.30. The foreign exchange market also tightened. Sellers still sold at the high price. Although there was a pullback afterward, buyers came to maintain prices at the lower levels. At noon, the overall trend was stable, and the outlook for the afternoon market was mediocre. Although it opened steady, it soon declined due to seller activity.

The Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank announced exchange rates that were unchanged for both British and American currencies. Although the Bank of Japan squeezed the East Asian rate, the process was stable. The silver equalization tax announcement showed a decrease of 75. At this point, banks engaged in mutual swap transactions, but there were no changes. Later, market sentiment improved, and the Bank of Japan came in to buy, resulting in a slightly tighter process. At noon, due to banks swapping shillings, the overall trend was peaceful. There were fewer transactions in the afternoon market. Banks engaged in swapping shillings and Japanese and American exchange rates, and the market situation became more stagnant.

Compared to the previous Saturday, the British rate was unchanged, and the American rate was tighter by 0.0625, due to the exchange rate retraction.

<p>Unified Government Bonds Rise Only for Ding-Type; Other Bonds Unanimously Fall by $0.05 to $0.45</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, the market situation remained depressed and unable to rise. After the required amount of legal tender for target purposes was sufficient, the market situation gradually declined. However, the number of transactions in March was not high, and most of them were in forward contracts. Therefore, the group of floating shorts was relatively calm. On the surface, the longs still appeared well-prepared, but they seemed to be strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The market price had been declining for several days, and there was no realization of maintenance. Based on the environmental situation and the serious situation of smuggling, the future was still difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday, the morning opening and closing sessions showed no signs of improvement. Numbers 10, 20, and 47 showed particular interest in Ding-type bonds. Therefore, in the first session, more Ding-type and Number 72 bonds were bought in the A and B types, and the downward trend suddenly stopped. Therefore, in the afternoon two sessions, there was a slight replenishment, rising back by $0.05 to $0.34. In the end, only Ding-type bonds were slightly firm, and the rest unanimously fell by $0.05 to $0.45. The total number of transactions was 5,001,500 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Due to Margin Calls, Longs in Yarn and Cotton Markets Cut Losses Heavily; Shorts Seize Opportunity and the Market Plummets: Prices for All Months Hit New Lows Since Last December</p>
<p>The yarn market collapsed, and the downward trend was fierce. The situation was extremely terrifying. This quiet shape was entirely due to the adverse environment. Smuggling of cloth became increasingly rampant, market sentiment rose sharply in panic, the long front wavered, and sellers took the opportunity to attack. As a result, the buying side collapsed, and the market plummeted. Prices for all months reached new lows since last December.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Drops $3.50</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the standard yarn market, all months showed no spirit, falling by $2.30. However, after entering the market, Changfeng and Yichang released large quantities, the table surface was unsustainable, and at the same time, spot yarn business was dull, market sentiment was even more panicked, and buyers were lacking. As a result, all months fell by $0.90 to $1.10, $2.40 compared to the morning closing price. In the afternoon opening, the market situation was still sluggish, and the momentum was very weak. A certain long could not deliver in time due to a margin call, and had to painfully cut losses. Therefore, market sentiment became more and more terrifying, selling was extremely strong, and market prices opened lower and lower. All months found new recent lows. As a result, all months fell by $2.00 to $2.50 compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Deda sold 1,850 bales, Xincheng 1,200 bales, Yichang 2,000 bales, Changfeng 5,700 bales, Juxing 1,450 bales, Yuda 1,050 bales, Shenji 1,750 bales, and Yuanyi 2,350 bales. Dafu bought 1,350 bales, Dafeng 4,950 bales, Shengyuan 1,600 bales, Tonghe 2,300 bales, Yuanda 1,200 bales, Ruida 1,350 bales, and Xiecheng 1,000 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below:</p>
<p>Thread Prices Also Fall by $2-3</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are silent. It was found that the statistics of the various gangs bought 425 bales throughout the day, the selling price fell by $1, and the thread price fell by $2-3. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>The cotton market plummeted wildly, and the downward trend intensified. This situation was entirely due to the rupture of the long positions. According to market rumors, a certain account had to painfully cut losses in large quantities due to margin calls. As a result, the market was unable to support itself, and market prices plummeted by $1.20. All months broke the $2 mark, it was said.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Plummets by More Than $1</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the standard cotton market, all months opened lower. The market atmosphere in the field was very slack, and all months were listless and spiritless. As the longs painfully cut losses, Changfeng and Yichang's selling was even stronger. As a result, all months fell by $0.30 to $0.25 compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon opening, because of floating words in the market, the chips on the table were extremely loose and rampant, and market prices opened lower and lower. The panic of the market reached its peak, and it had the potential to be like a broken bamboo. The long positions were completely unable to support it. As a result, all months fell by $0.60 to $0.75, $0.85 compared to the morning closing price. The June contract fell sharply by $1.20 compared to the previous day's price. This kind of downward trend was not seen since October of the previous year. It was found that Shenchang sold 3,300 dan, Daji 4,800 dan, Jinchang 4,800 dan, Yichang 4,700 dan, Changfeng 7,000 dan, Mingde 2,500 dan, Hexing 3,600 dan, and Changyu 2,300 dan. Xincheng bought 4,900 bales, Dafu 3,100 dan, Dafeng 6,000 dan, Jinghua 2,500 dan, Yikang 2,300 dan, Xinchang 3,800 dan, Yuanda 2,400 dan, Zhenda 2,800 dan, Taichang 4,000 dan, and Runkang 5,600 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Mills Need to Stop</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is quite clear, and factory needs are stopped. Yuyuan Yao cotton 650 bales, Tong cotton 190 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e177">New Cotton Crops Are Quite Smooth; There Are 550,000 Dan of Cotton in Storage in This City <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The planting situation of new cotton is progressing quite smoothly. Generally, it is expected that, if this continues, it may be a very bumper harvest. Continuous rain has fallen in North China, and with the help of the cotton improvement policy, it has increased in reverse. Compared with the early disaster season from January to May of the previous year, there is a world of difference. Cotton areas in Shandong, Lingbao, Tianjin, and Hubei have all been planted. Due to good climate and other reasons, Tongzhou Cotton and North China Cotton have also been planted halfway. Currently, there are a total of 550,000 dan of cotton in storage in this city, including 300,000 dan of Lingbao cotton, 67,000 dan of Hubei cotton, 78,000 dan of Tongzhou cotton, and 70,000 dan of Tianjin cotton. In addition, there is still a lot of surplus old cotton, and the total amount is also quite large, it is said.</p>

<p>Last week, Japanese and European exporters were quite active in the market. The quota of exporters was easily resolved, and there was no need to seek futures. The futures trading was very sluggish. New Bai Luoxi cotton was difficult to attract attention due to uncertain seasonal rains, and spot needs decreased, and inventories increased. The need for cloth was unusually light, and the public thought that US cotton had no possibility of rising in the near future, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm. However, the market situation was still able to be maintained, and there was no significant fluctuation. The industry is waiting for new stimulus. An appendix of last week's statistics is as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>Coarse Cloth Suffers a Sharper Decline - Some Are Already Within Cost - Jin and Lu Gangs Have Not Procured for a Long Time</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was under the weight of the exchange's yarn and cotton cuts, and the market image was even more bleak. However, the cloth price fell sharply in the last ten days of last month, more than yarn and cotton, and has fallen into the cost range. Factories have no intention of selling, so even under the adverse environments of thick inventory, increasing smuggling, and frequent yarn and cotton declines, the decline has slowed down. Yesterday, white goods were slightly tired. Only Yihua Factory's light and heavy coarse cloth were fortunate enough to have large purchases from the Jin Gang and Lu Province. They have rarely purchased recently, so there is a lot of inventory, and the decline is more severe. Yesterday, heavy coarse cloth fell by $0.15 to $0.20 per piece, light cloth fell by $0.025 to $0.10, and light coarse twill fell by $0.10 per piece. More than 100 pieces were brought into this street, which are needed for sales in the Jiangzhe inner road. The Sichuan Gang and Yangtze Gang slightly brought in more than 200 pieces of plain white, colored satin, plain pongee, hemp yarn, foreign yarn, fine cloth, fine twill, and colored cloth from this factory. The Qingdao Gang brought in more than ten boxes of plain plain pongee. Most of them were temporarily delayed due to rain, it is said.</p>

<p>The woolen cloth aspect has still been good recently, with transactions mainly in summer white goods. Raincoat cloth sales have been active due to the rainy weather, but most of them are Dong goods double-sided yarn and Xihuo's Kaichengmei. Double-sided first number sells for $0.55, second number for $0.825, Kaishuimei double-sided for $7.6, and single-sided for $5.3. The transactions of each gang in this street are quite prosperous, and white drill, white straight, white rubber cloth, palice, feather yarn tweed, and rose tweed all have considerable sales openings, and the price is similar to last week. Runfu Tianxiang sesame rubber cloth is wholesaled for $1.4 per yard, Japanese goods Runfu white rubber cloth is $0.5 net plate, domestic narrow door rubber cloth is bought for $0.3, feather yarn tweed is generally sold for $4, Fengyu white drill is $4.4, and Yiji Dao Xiancao is $4.85, it is said.</p>

<p>Recently, silk weaving factories have been rushing to produce summer goods, so matte silk sales are smooth, and glossy silk transactions are flat. The price of the 120 Tianqiao brand once rose sharply before, but now it has turned tired. Although no private goods have been loaded in for several days, the price has instead fallen. The opening price is $314.5, which is $3-4 lower than before. Yesterday, silk factories in this city bought more than 20 boxes of French 100-number Sanshu brand matte silk at a price of $380, and 25 boxes of Italian 150-number second-class Sinaiai glossy silk at a price of $382-3. Shengze Gang bought 25 boxes of 100-number fourth-class Xuetelong matte silk at a price of $375. 30 boxes of Italian 75-number third-class Xuetelong matte silk were shipped from Dalian. On the 15th of this month, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs will invite bids for goods totaling 35,641.59 pounds, equivalent to more than 178 boxes. The various colors are listed as follows:</p>
<p>The above goods are all glossy silk.</p>

<p>Rumor of Cheap Sale of Aged Wheat; Futures Flour Rises and Then Falls</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, the market in each month showed a phenomenon of first rising and then falling. The quoted price of foreign wheat has been pulling prices for two days, and the difference is only one or two corners to five or six corners. When the opening price was set, the longs for June were competing again, so it rose step by step, and the highest price once rose to 3 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 li. The other months were also brought up by 1-2 points because of this. However, after the second session, the longs came out, and it was rumored that the aged wheat in the north road was stored smoothly. Therefore, most of the people in the far road were looking small. One said that the aged wheat was sold in large quantities, and there was a saying that 4 yuan and 7 jiao was willing to sell, so the market atmosphere gradually declined step by step. By the time the afternoon session opened, although the rain continued, people's hearts were not prosperous, and it gradually loosened, falling by three or four points compared to the initial opening, and also slightly less than two points compared to the previous weekend. According to the current situation, if a large batch of aged wheat arrives, from a practical point of view, it will be difficult to overcome the vibration, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Thanks to Longs for Maintaining, Futures Wheat Still Rises Three or Four Points <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, the morning opening, due to the wrong weather and the good flour market, the price of each month was quite excellent, but because the factory did not move and buying was not prosperous, the rise in each month was only better than three or five points. By the time the afternoon session opened, the June and July expectations had softened by two or three points due to the decline in the flour market. However, it was held back by the longs, and it rose back slightly. However, it is widely rumored in the market that the aged wheat in the north road will arrive in abundance, so the rear step may fall again because of this, it is not known. The current wheat market situation, because the factory is average, the price has become very loose. For example, Yao Wan Bengbu wheat is only opening at 4 yuan and 9 jiao, a drop of 1 jiao, totaling 1,500 bags, which was taken care of by Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<p>US Wheat Market: Kansas, Nebraska, northern Texas and Oklahoma continue to experience heavy rains, the Canadian government plans to cultivate 24,354,000 acres, an increase of 3% over last year, and factories are buying new wheat when prices plummet.</p>

<p>(Hunan) Yesterday, only more than ten numbers arrived from each gang (goods totaling more than 3,000 shi), and transactions were not many due to rain in the sales field. This street rarely asked questions, and the bags said there was no impediment, resulting in a sluggish market situation. Ruo Hou Zao Japonica and Bo Dao quotations are all without honor or disgrace, and Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan City are also similar.</p>
<p>(Zhabei) Yesterday, the weather was overcast and rainy, and there were not many sources from each gang under the river, and the number of stores listed was also few, resulting in limited sales and little ups and downs in price compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>Passenger Xian's storage has been sufficient, and the market has not improved in speed. The weather is gradually getting hotter, and the traveling groups dare not defend for a long time, and the situation is even more difficult to change. However, yesterday's internal sales were still good, and this street also had to deal with it, and the Quanzhou Gang, which had been stagnant for a long time, came to the market to inquire about Jiangxi's machine late rice, and the machine early was also active in the inland of this street, so the tired wind turned around and the market was stable. If Quan Zhou and other gangs in the inland continue to sell out in the next few days, the market can still stand up. A total of 5,670 bags of Gan rice, 100 bags of Xiang rice, 390 bags of Taizhou rice, and 160 bags of rough rice were opened throughout the day, and the market was similar to the previous market. Soybeans saw stability in the midst of fatigue.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market continued to fall by $0.2, due to weak actual sales and unstable market sentiment. Yesterday, the unified market opened with 130 pieces of oil from this factory, 200 pieces of Dalian oil, 100 pieces of Niuzhuang oil, and 90 pieces of Dalian Qishan oil. The above transaction numbers are not really actual transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market atmosphere softened, and the high-priced goods were still flat, and the middle-resolution continued to fall by 1-2 points. The outgoing route relied on the Xichang Gang to inquire, and yesterday, the Changde Factory also procured, so the overall situation was able to stabilize in the midst of fatigue. A total of 4,890 bags of various beans were traded.</p>

The peach meat stock is also thin. Yesterday, high-quality goods such as Tongguan peach meat was 46 yuan, Shangluo was 456 yuan, high tiger skin peach meat was 40 yuan, and the second was 278 yuan.</p>
<p>Xianglian sales are still dull, and the Guang Gang specializes in taking the low-priced Raozhou goods as the target.

<p>Hunan pure antimony, recently the market has been quiet, so the market trend is also quite sluggish. However, the orders placed by local firms with the producing areas last month have been shipped one after another, resulting in a large accumulation in the market. Moreover, the recent credit crunch, coupled with the substantial capital tied up by the firms due to the large volume of goods arriving, has led to a shortage of working capital. Consequently, they have entrusted brokers to promote sales in an attempt to dispose of the goods quickly. Unfortunately, foreign firms have suspended operations, and sales by local factories have also stagnated, making it difficult to sell the goods. Therefore, the market is weak, morale is low, and standard asking prices have softened. Currently, the wholesale transaction price is 760 yuan per ton, while the retail price is approximately 775 yuan per ton. It has been observed that in the recent period, aside from occasional retail transactions, wholesale transactions have been rare.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Research on the Science of Moxibustion Treatment (Part 2) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>(E) The Relationship Between Moxibustion and Head's Zones. When internal organs are diseased, a specific skin area corresponding to the organ develops a zone of hypersensitivity. This was thoroughly studied by Head, and is specifically called Head's Zone. This corresponds vaguely with the meridians and acupoints of our ancient country. Therefore, when treating diseases, applying moxibustion at a specific location, that is, the so-called acupoint, is more effective than applying it to other locations.</p>
<p>(F) The Medical Effects of Moxibustion. Although the medical effects of moxibustion are not yet fully understood, based on the above research findings, it is likely due to the synergistic effects of the following factors:</p>
<p>Stimulation Therapy Using a Type of Foreign Protein</p>
<p>When burning moxa on the skin, causing mild burns, the proteins in that area coagulate, are broken down, and absorbed. This can be regarded as a type of foreign protein. When absorbed, it succeeds as stimulation therapy. Try other methods, such as using electricity, platinum cautery, etc., to burn the skin, or using the above method to extract the skin, muscles, etc., and after reaching the degree of protein coagulation, make a colloid and inject it. Symptoms very similar to moxibustion treatment occur.</p>
<p>Stimulating the Autonomic Nervous System</p>
<p>When moxa is burned, its intense heat stimulates pain, reflexively stimulating the autonomic nervous system, especially the sympathetic nervous system. This excitation of the sympathetic nervous system can cause vasoconstriction, increased pulse, increased blood pressure, and calm intestinal peristalsis. Moreover, this stimulation can also change the distribution of blood, impacting the function of internal organs, thus affecting the disease.</p>
<p>Promoting the Production of "Hormones"</p>
<p>When moxibustion is applied, the sympathetic nerve is most stimulated. Therefore, the sympathetic nerve distributed in the adrenal gland is also excited, which increases the production of adrenaline. As a result, the physiological effects of adrenaline temporarily increase, increasing blood sugar, increasing pulse, constricting blood vessels, increasing blood pressure, calming intestinal movement, and restoring muscle fatigue, which are also largely affected by adrenaline.</p>
<p>Changes in Blood</p>
<p>White blood cell count increases, phagocytic function increases. Red blood cell count and hemoglobin increase, blood clotting time is shortened, and blood sugar increases. These changes will inevitably have some impact on the course of the disease.</p>
<p>Relationship with Head's Zones</p>
<p>When moxibustion is applied to a specific location on the skin, that is, at an acupoint, the related internal organs receive special stimulation. Compared with applying moxibustion to other parts that are completely unrelated to this, it should be more effective. However, some scholars believe that acupoints are irrelevant, which still leaves room for research.</p>

The population mortality rate in Zhenjiang is 26.1 per thousand (see "Zhenjiang Geliu Township, Survey of Hygiene of 61 Farm Families" by Zhu Yunda). The population mortality rate in Tongshan County is slightly more than 20 per thousand (see "Rural Economic Survey of Tongshan" by Jiangsu Farmers Bank).</p>
<p>(2) Fertility rate: According to Zhang Luluan's survey, the population of Yangliu Village in Jiangning is 20.1 per thousand, and the reproductive index is 82.7. According to my survey of the population in Geliu Township, Zhenjiang, the fertility rate is 33.8 per thousand, and the reproductive index is 129.5.</p>
<p>(3) Jiangsu has two serious endemic diseases: Kala-azar in northern Jiangsu and hookworm disease in southern Jiangsu. In Huaian rural areas, more than 20% of villagers suffer from Kala-azar, and the number of patients is even higher in Siyang, Lianshui, Shuyang, Suqian, and other counties. In Suzhou villages, 47% of 770 families are affected by hookworm disease. During physical examinations, 80% of 611 workers in mulberry groves were affected by hookworm disease. They had 5,482 hookworm eggs per cubic centimeter of feces. Statistics show that 77% of female workers and 71% of male workers are affected by hookworm disease. (Ocat Cademy survey)</p>
<p>(4) In Shangyuan County, 140 farm households spend an average of 522.0 yuan per year on medical expenses, with self-cultivating farmers accounting for 70.1%, semi-self-cultivating farmers accounting for 12.5%, and tenant farmers accounting for 17.4% (see page 317 of "Rural Economic Data of China").</p>
<p>(5) Wuxi farmers, with an average of five family members, spend less than one jiao per month on health expenses, accounting for 0.35% of their total monthly living expenses. However, superstition expenses average two jiao per month, accounting for 0.66% of the total (see "Agricultural Special Issue of Wuxi Magazine").</p>
<p>(6) In Jintan and Liyang, 170 hired laborers spend an average of 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 9 fen per year on health expenses and 5 yuan, 1 jiao, and 4 fen on tobacco and alcohol (see "Survey of the Lives of Hired Laborers in Jintan and Liyang" by Chen Wusheng).</p>
<p>(7) In Zhenjiang villages, 261 families have a total of 534 bedrooms. The most common is one bedroom per family, accounting for 45.5% of the total, or 118 families. Out of 534 bedrooms, 346 have no windows, accounting for 74.48%. 175 bedrooms are connected to the kitchen, accounting for 32.8%. 56 bedrooms are connected to the pigsty, accounting for 10.5%. The poor living conditions of farmers can be imagined (Zhu Yunda's "Hygiene Survey of 262 Farm Families in Geliu Township, Zhenjiang").</p>
<p>(8) Jiangsu Province has a total of 272 hospitals, 6,240 beds, 611 doctors, and 1,034 nurses (see "Statistical Communication" by the Statistical Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Government).</p>

<h3 id="e197">A Global View of Tuberculosis Statistics (8) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>According to Armand and Lestorduoy's research, tuberculosis infection in school-age children is mainly due to transmission within the family, and cases originating from schools are rare. Generally speaking, there are very few cases of tuberculosis deaths in young children. Tuberculosis transmission is more common at higher ages; around age 25, it is approximately 61%.</p>
<p>Heymann's work in 1927 is as follows: Statistics on tuberculosis infection in this Belgian country, at various ages, are approximately as shown in the table below. (Positive tuberculin reaction)</p>
<p>0 to 1 year: Unknown</p>
<p>1 to 5 years: 32%</p>
<p>5 to 15 years: 37%</p>
<p>15 to 20 years: 85%</p>
<p>30 to 60 years: 96%</p>
<p>60 to 80 years: 98%</p>
<p>80 to 90 years: 100%</p>
<p>The above percentages are quite high.</p>
<p>In other countries, such as Italy, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Hungary, reports are only available from areas with clinics, so the numbers are very small and not worth mentioning. However, these reported numbers are generally quite safe. We often observe that tuberculosis transmission is not very severe in early childhood, but occurs more often at later ages. Usvedt conducted an experiment in Norway, which showed that in 1914, 67.5% of children aged 15 had a positive tuberculin reaction, while in 1930, the percentage was 40.5%. This peak is undoubtedly due to poor public health.</p>
<p>The situation is worse in Serbia, Poland, and Russia. In Poland, according to Zelewska-Dezyna's transmission statistics, among workers' children aged 6 to 12, 38% to 68% are infected. Infection rates are better in children from more privileged backgrounds, at 19% to 30%. Children in Serbia and Russia also show the same trend. According to Jachniss's statistics, 69% of children in Russia under the age of 14 have a positive tuberculin reaction.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that in Latvia, there are 63 cases of tuberculosis deaths per 10,000 children under the age of 5, indicating the high rate of tuberculosis infection in that country.</p>
<p>In the United States, Dfckey believes that tuberculosis infection in young children is relatively widespread, but not more so than in adults. Among children under the age of 4, 14.22% have a positive tuberculin reaction, and 3.25% have tuberculosis. Among these patients, the mortality rate is 4.7%. Of particular note is McCain's tuberculosis statistics for school-age children. Among 25,048 school children under the age of 15, 22.59% had a positive tuberculin reaction, of whom only 1.79% or 7.62% were also confirmed to have tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Black children, such as those of Native American descent, have higher rates of both positive tuberculin reactions and confirmed cases of tuberculosis than white children, with ratios of 27.41% to 3.21% and 22.7% to 1.53%, respectively. Another statistic from Chadwick shows that among every 10,000 young children, 20% are infected by the age of 5, and 25% by the age of 15. Therefore, tuberculosis infection is not as severe in the Americas as it is in Europe. However, tuberculosis infection rates are high in the major cities of both continents. In a test in Philadelphia, the results for school-age children were 38% at age 5, 71% at age 10, and 81% at age 15. Hetherington's observation is that this transmission is largely due to chronic contact, such as with family members with open tuberculosis. Transmission between teachers and students in schools is initially not of great concern.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis in school-age children and tuberculosis in young children are very similar to the situation in the military. In Germany, for example, tuberculosis screening for university students is very strict. Students at the University of Munich, for example, are required to undergo mandatory examinations, with ages between 18 and 25. A mandatory chest examination in 1929 of 30,000 students found that 0.4% had active open tuberculosis, 0.22% had active closed tuberculosis, 0.51% had semi-active tuberculosis, and 27.41% had inactive tuberculosis (Inaktiven). This shows that there is a slight tendency for active tuberculosis to increase, and the phenomenon of various types of tuberculosis also increases with age, until the age of 25. The most numerous phenomena of various early symptoms occur at the age of 22. The same evidence was found by Kayser-Petersen et al. in student examinations in Jena and by Wiewiorowsky in student examinations in Bremen. However, student examinations in Leipzig showed a higher number, with active tuberculosis at 1.8%. However, only 0.6% of students underwent examinations in Breslau, so the two places are the same. This difference in examination results is due to the population density and its environment (such as whether it is an industrial or agricultural area).</p>

<p>What is chlorosis?</p>
<p>This is an independent anemia that occurs in women during puberty.</p>
<p>How can women develop chlorosis during puberty?</p>
<p>The real cause of this disease is not very clear. However, there are many things that can induce chlorosis, such as inappropriate sedentary lifestyle, occupations in poorly ventilated environments (female workers), lack of sunlight, mental and physical overwork (students), and mental excitement. Some say that this disease is related to a lack of ovarian endocrine secretion.</p>

<p>How does the patient feel all over?</p>
<p>The muscles are fatigued all over, and the ability to work is reduced. Digestive organs are also impaired, with reduced appetite and excessive stomach acid; patients have pica, liking to eat sour tastes, chalk, charcoal, and mud from walls. Patients also suffer from gastroptosis. The nervous system also has abnormalities, often complaining of headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, apathy, blurred vision, and fainting.</p>
<p>Do women with chlorosis have abnormal menstruation?</p>
<p>Menstruation is irregular, sometimes stopping, and sometimes having excessive or difficult menstruation.</p>
<p>What other symptoms are there?</p>
<p>Heart murmurs, rapid pulse, enlarged cardiac dullness, thin urine, sometimes containing protein, and edema of the skin, especially noticeable on the ankles and eyelids.</p>
<p>Is the course of this disease acute or chronic, malignant or benign?</p>
<p>The course of the disease can be acute or slow; but most are benign and can be completely cured after several weeks to several months. However, it is prone to recurrence.</p>
<p>What diseases are likely to occur in combination with chlorosis?</p>
<p>It is possible for it to occur in combination with pulmonary tuberculosis, gastric ulcers, and neurosis.</p>
<p>What diseases should it be distinguished from?</p>
<p>This disease should be distinguished from early pulmonary tuberculosis, stomach disease, kidney disease, syphilis, hyperthyroidism, and other conditions.</p>
<p>When treating chlorosis, what sanitary precautions should be taken?</p>
<p>In terms of hygiene, the most important thing is sufficient sunlight. Patients should move to the mountains, countryside, or seaside. Mineral spring baths have good effects. Food should be selected from easily digestible plant-based foods. All greasy and rich foods should be avoided. Milk is also not very suitable. The most suitable foods are egg yolk, liver, fresh vegetables, fruits, and grains.</p>
<p>What medicines should be used to treat chlorosis?</p>
<p>Iron preparations are considered to be effective drugs. Arsenic preparations are also good. Organ therapy involves injecting ovarian endocrine preparations and liver preparations. Physical therapy includes carbonated spring baths, salt spring baths, sweating methods, and artificial sun lamp irradiation. For headaches and stomach problems, it may be helpful to administer symptomatic treatments separately.</p>

<p>(88) Explanation of the Lacrimal Apparatus</p>
<p>The lacrimal apparatus also occupies an important part in ophthalmology. It is often prone to disease. Generally, people often do not pay attention to it, resulting in the location of the lesion being often unclear. I will briefly explain it here.</p>
<p>The lacrimal apparatus can be divided into two parts in anatomy: the lacrimal gland and the lacrimal duct.</p>
<p>Lacrimal Gland—The lacrimal gland is a type of tubular gland, an organ for excreting tears. It is located in the lacrimal fossa in the upper outer corner of the eye socket. It is formed by the upper [missing word] part [missing word] part is in the bone [missing word]. It is named the upper lacrimal gland, or the orbital lacrimal gland. The lower part is behind the eyelid, called the lower lacrimal gland, or the palpebral lacrimal gland. Each gland has multiple secretory ducts that open into the fornix of the upper conjunctiva. The secretion of tears is governed by the facial nerve and the trigeminal nerve. It constantly secretes a small amount of tears so that the surface of the conjunctiva and cornea can maintain proper moisture, prevent dryness, and wash away foreign dust, keeping the eye clean and smooth. However, in times of mental emotion or when the trigeminal nerve is stimulated, a large amount of tears can be secreted through reflex action. Therefore, when we are sad, tears can roll down involuntarily in an instant. This is a good example.</p>
<p>Lacrimal Duct—The lacrimal duct is composed of four parts: the lacrimal puncta, the canaliculi, the lacrimal sac, and the nasolacrimal duct.</p>
<p>Lacrimal Puncta—On the upper and lower eyelid margins of the medial canthus, it is grayish-white and slightly raised, with a small hole in the middle, which is the opening of the lacrimal canaliculus.</p>
<p>Lacrimal Canaliculi—One each above and below. Both open into the lacrimal sac.</p>
<p>Lacrimal Sac—Located in the lacrimal fossa. The upper end is connected to the lacrimal canaliculi, and the lower end communicates with the nasolacrimal duct.</p>
<p>Nasolacrimal Duct—Extends vertically downwards from the lower end of the lacrimal sac and opens into the inferior nasal meatus. Therefore, tears can be absorbed by the lacrimal canaliculi and sent into the lacrimal sac, passing through the nasolacrimal duct and being excreted into the nasal cavity (inferior nasal meatus).</p>
<p>To clarify the location of the lacrimal apparatus, a diagram is drawn for reference.</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Heating is the most reliable method of sterilization and is used in all infectious diseases! Tuberculosis bacillus is no exception. Its methods of application include burning, hot air, steam, and boiling; because they all belong to warm heat, their sterilization effectiveness also varies greatly. For example, the effectiveness of dry heat (ordinary heating over a fire) is not very reliable. Conversely, in flowing steam, tuberculosis bacilli can be completely killed in half an hour. To explain in detail, at 85 degrees (Celsius), only one minute is required; about two minutes at 78 degrees, three minutes at 73 degrees, five minutes at 70 degrees, fifteen minutes at 65 degrees, and so on approximately equally below. This great sterilization achievement is certainly not comparable to ordinary dry heat. The sterilization achievement of boiling is similar to that of the steam method. The death of tuberculosis bacilli also only takes three to five minutes.</p>
<p>Burning is certainly a one-stop solution, and it is more thorough than the three methods of hot air, steam, and boiling. However, we must know that, apart from the patient's sputum, the patient's clothing, books, and all utensils cannot be completely burned at once. Even the steam and boiling methods are difficult to cope with; the defects in this cannot but be addressed by natural sunlight!</p>
<p>Using Sunlight Irradiation Sunlight is the greatest enemy of tuberculosis bacilli, as almost everyone knows. It is not only effective in killing tuberculosis bacilli when directly irradiated, but also effective when reflected once, such as sunlight entering the room through paper windows or glass windows, but the effect is relatively weak. Therefore, tuberculosis bacilli usually cannot survive for a long time in well-lit rooms. For the patient's residence, of course, sufficient light should be the top priority, and the windows should be opened as much as possible to allow sunlight to directly shine for a long time.</p>
<p>The power of sunlight to kill tuberculosis bacilli also varies slightly depending on the thickness of the sputum layer: ordinary direct sunlight kills tuberculosis bacilli in approximately one to three hours. For thick layers of sputum, no matter how strong the sunlight is, it takes at least twenty hours. Daytime light is also one of the enemies of tuberculosis bacilli, but it takes at least several days to achieve sterilization, and the effect is not very reliable, so it cannot be compared with sunlight!</p>

<p>— Idle</p>
<p>The fickleness of human relationships, the ancients often sighed about it, but as of now, the degree of fickleness is even more advanced than before. Whether in ancient times or modern times, in China or abroad, such a drama is played out every day between races or in society. Humans are originally opportunistic animals, deceptive animals, cruel animals. Assuming one sees through such a drama and does not join in the performance, this person will be called a fool.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, please look at the seven-day telegram from Jerusalem. King Abdullah is scheduled to arrive here from Haifa tomorrow, and the authorities do not intend to hold any ceremony. British High Commissioner Sir Arthur Wauchope is currently inspecting Sinai Island in Egypt and will not be present to welcome him either. Why is this? Because the current King Abdullah is no longer the king who ruled in Abyssinia before, but a king of a fallen country. Power is gone, status is lost, what is the point of welcoming him? If King Abdullah were still the monarch of an independent country and happened to visit Jerusalem for leisure, I don't know how the authorities would welcome him, what kind of respect he would receive? Even Sir Arthur Wauchope of the British Empire would definitely make a special trip to attend the grand ceremony. It is not surprising that the local authorities are like this, nor is it surprising that Sir Arthur Wauchope of the British Empire is like this. This is called worldliness, this is called the fickle world.</p>
<p>In this way, King Abdullah doesn't need to complain or be indignant. The world is like this. There are countless examples in history of people complaining about such things. First, blame himself for not being able to defend his territory and for being powerless to resist the brutal aggression of imperialism. Moreover, humans are not only fickle animals, but also the most cruel animals. Not only do they kill without blinking an eye during wartime, but even in everyday actions, none is without cruelty. For example, King Abdullah decided to take his family and followers from Djibouti Port in French Somaliland, take a British cruiser, and transfer to Jerusalem. When passing through Port Said in Egypt, the Italian Crown Princess was taking the Italian hospital ship Caesar to return to her country. Italian expatriates all held flags at the pier to see her off. When King Abdullah's ship passed through the port, less than a few hours apart, the Italian national flag on the pier had not yet been removed. King Abdullah looked at the flying Italian national flag on the deck and couldn't help but feel sad. I don't know why the Italian Crown Princess returned to her country at this time, is it a coincidence? Or is it intentional to return at this time, flaunting her power, to stimulate King Abdullah's heart? How uncomfortable must King Abdullah be with this painful phenomenon? If the monarch of a fallen country is already so distressed, what kind of pain will the people of a fallen country have to endure?</p>

<p>— Muye</p>
<p>Zhu Qi Monkey thrust his thick and short neck back with force, and there was a sound of "Ke... Pu!" Then a mouthful of sticky phlegm fell "Gua'er" onto Mao Mao's father's face. Then he snatched up his tiger fist and beat the table, shouting "Bang! Bang!" "You motherfucker, what are you saying? Based on conscience? ... You still want to cheat me? You... shameless! Bastard son of a bitch like you, you can really be called unmatched in the world, unmatched..."</p>
<p>"But... but—"</p>
<p>"But a chicken's egg, but... I, Zhu Qi Monkey, can't be considered unkind. Hey, hey! Let yourself say it, huh? Don't you know how to use your conscience? Then use this conscience... what's wrong? Did you stuff donkey hair in your ears? You motherfucker!..."</p>
<p>"Master Zhu Qi, you don't need to..."</p>
<p>"Don't need to, what the fuck don't need to! It's simply farting here, you!"</p>
<p>"The money I borrowed from you wasn't borrowed for nothing, huh, five and a half cents interest per month, isn't that right? Master Zhu Qi!..." "Good, your fart is pretty good, huh! - But I ask you, have you given me a single cent in the past six months? Huh? You motherfucker, you still have a hard tongue. Good! If you can't pay back the principal and interest today, there will be trouble, I'm telling you!"</p>
<p>Here, Mao Mao's father panicked. "Principal and interest," principal and interest would be one hundred and eighty yuan, where was he going to find the money? He cried anxiously, wiping away his tears (taking the opportunity to wipe away the phlegm as well). He thought the only way was to beg, so he plopped down and knelt:</p>
<p>"Master Qi, kind-hearted master! May the heavens bless Master Qi with many sons and grandsons, ah! Please, I beg you..."</p>
<p>"I'm not that good, ah! I simply don't rely on conscience!"</p>
<p>"No, no! Master Qi, I really don't rely on conscience, I!... Borrowed your old man's money and didn't pay it back, and even made you angry, I deserve to be beaten, I deserve it!..." Mao Mao's father cried and pleaded, slapping his own mouth! "Please, old man, have mercy, give me a few more months, ah... My son is dead, I only have a wife and a daughter to rely on, what can they do, ah, you are a kind person..."</p>
<p>"Motherfucker, looking at that bull energy you had just now, I really wanted to beat you senseless, you know that?... Hmph! If it wasn't for seeing how old you are, I might have made you suffer more than you can handle!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!..."</p>
<p>"Motherfucker, when can the money be repaid, say it?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, this..."</p>
<p>"I've already thought of a way for you, you motherfucker... come here, ah!"</p>
<p>"Yes, ah!" Thirty people responded from inside.</p>
<p>Before long, that Mr. Liu, looking sly, came, holding a piece of paper in his hand. He smiled obsequiously and handed it to Zhu Qi Monkey, who took it and read it once, then said to Mao Mao's father:</p>
<p>"Hey! I see... you can't pay it today either, hmph! I'll give you two more months, how about that?"</p>
<p>"That's great, in two months I'll risk my life to pay off this debt, Master Qi, you're really too good, may you have much happiness and long life..."</p>
<p>"Motherfucker, don't be long-winded! This is a written agreement, which means giving you two more months, ah! Put your mark here!"</p>
<p>"Put a mark?..."</p>
<p>"Old bastard, draw a cross, that's fine!" Mr. Liu said:</p>
<p>"Oh! I understand, I understand... So he picked up a pen with his left hand and drew a crooked cross on the paper from bottom to top, from right to left. He thought it wasn't drawn well, and wanted to draw it straighter, but Mr. Liu snatched the pen away, and the ink remained on his two fingers.</p>
<p>"Long-winded,... get out!"</p>
<p>Mao Mao's father kowtowed a few times, tearfully and gratefully withdrew. He heard Zhu Qi Monkey and Mr. Liu laugh loudly.</p>
<p>The day after Mao Mao's father happily went home and told his wife and daughter, Zhu Qi Monkey, Mr. Liu, along with many people and the police, went to his house. Zhu Qi Monkey held the paper with the cross he had drawn. As soon as they met, Zhu Qi Monkey slapped Mao Mao's father a few times, cursing:</p>
<p>"You bastard son of a bitch, where is the person? Quickly hand her over!"</p>
<p>"What person, ah? Master Qi..."</p>
<p>Slap! Slap! Slap! The slaps rang out again.</p>
<p>"Didn't you write an agreement, you even drew a cross!" Zhu Qi Monkey turned around, waved his hand, and seven or eight big men rushed into the inner room with a whoop, grabbed Mao Mao, tied her up hand and foot, and carried her away.</p>
<p>"What's going on, ah? Heavens!..."</p>
<p>"What's going on? Motherfucker, you owe me money and pledged your daughter to me as collateral, I'm here to get her today!" Zhu Qi Monkey turned his head and said to the police: "Seal up his house, this house is also pledged to me, anyway, I have a written agreement!..."</p>
<p>"Injustice, ah! Master Qi, people must rely on conscience, ah... Mao Mao's father and his wife both stamped their feet and cried, shouting: You gave us two months grace, ah! How could it be..."</p>
<p>"Hmph! You know how to twist words, motherfucker, anyway, I have a written agreement, and your cross!" The large group of people shouted and left. Only the police remained nailing up the door, and the old couple were left crying and shouting to the heavens on the ground...</p>
<h3 id="e205">Lion <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zinan</p>
<p>Probably because someone compared China to a lion, I have a good impression of lions.</p>
<p>First, I saw in books that when a lion roars, other wild animals hide without a trace. I really felt the greatness of lions.</p>
<p>After that, I saw it in films called wild animal films. Seeing lions and tigers fighting fiercely, I also felt a lot of excitement, as if I were the lion.</p>
<p>At this time, people gradually began to call China a "sleeping lion." "Sleeping lion," that's okay, it's just sleeping, when it wakes up it will still roar, it will still fight tigers and the like.</p>
<p>But then I saw the circus. After seeing the circus, I lost my great impression of lions, because they would succumb to the whips of circus performers.</p>
<p>However, probably because my past fondness for them was too deep, although I couldn't help but feel a little humiliated by their performance under the whip, I still couldn't help but fantasize that their submission was only temporary. Once they woke up, not only would the whip be useless, but even the circus performers holding the whip would be swallowed by them.</p>
<p>The result was naturally disappointment. The lion still obediently performed under the whip.</p>
<p>Since then, I have seen lions in the zoo again. When I first saw it, because it had just been caught from the mountains, it was quite ambitious. It kept running back and forth in the iron cage, roaring when it saw people, and even pounced on the iron bars. At this time, my fondness for it returned, thinking that although it was locked in an iron cage, if anyone dared to walk over, it would undoubtedly be devoured by it.</p>
<p>Recently, I went there again, and it happened to be eating beef. After eating, it stretched comfortably, then lay on the cement floor and licked the cement with its tongue. When people approached it, it acted as if it didn't see them.</p>
<p>The people outside watching saw its lazy demeanor, so they used all kinds of sounds to scare it, and some even threw things at it. But it just yawned lazily, took a few steps, moved farther away and lay down again.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The voices outside the iron cage were still the same, and those who threw things at it were still the same, and it seemed like they were throwing even harder.</p>
<p>This time, it stood up, and I thought, now it should pounce over, but it didn't. It just roared once and hid in the haystack.</p>
<p>When I left it, I was thinking: This kind of lion must be near death, right? Being threatened and provoked by all kinds of sounds, being thrown at with all kinds of things, it should also be insulted to death. Although it has people who raise it giving it beef to eat.</p>
<p>But then I thought: This lion cannot represent all lions.</p>

<p>— Zhuang Ruiyuan</p>
<p>Crossing a small ridge of subtropical long-leaved forest, through thick leaves and tree trunks, a distant driveway unfolded its jaundiced body on the wild wilderness, stretching remotely into the boundless wilderness.</p>
<p>On the wilderness, the driveway stretching to such a distant end, its jaundiced body thin like a dead snake.</p>
<p>Tall fir trees grew sparsely along the road, remaining as lonely as single people. Under the hot and barren heat of the big sun, the wilderness was desolate and the fir trees were old. This scene was like an ancient road with stone stacks and starlight meals.</p>
<p>To conquer this wild journey, we were sitting in a dilapidated motorcycle, with our legs painfully resting on the iron box, and a wide-brimmed sun hat replacing the willow branches as our car shed.</p>
<p>This was a hot summer day, and the sweat hanging on our faces spread a wet stain on our clothes as soon as it touched them.</p>
<p>The dilapidated motorcycle was like a tired old horse, running at full speed, but still bumping and turning as heavily as an ox cart. The front of the car spat out mouthfuls of water vapor and foam with a hiss, panting, struggling as if climbing mountains. The water in the front of the car must be running out.</p>
<p>The flat driveway, yet conquering it was still so difficult!</p>
<p>Covered in sweat, people felt tired. The broken car was even more tired than people, bumping like an ox cart, the sweat of the long-distance traveler being crushed and spat out under the wheels.</p>
<p>Newcomers uncomfortably miss the home they left behind, worrying about the road ahead, and they are single young people.</p>
<p>Travelers cannot calculate their return journey by days.</p>
<p>The person who sent me off, who often gave me fatherly nagging, was a kind old servant. He sent me to a remote ferry, from where I had to board a large sea ship to go to a place even farther away.</p>
<p>All of this was strange to me, no familiar people, no familiar home!</p>
<p>"Young people face danger when they leave home. This world is built on a swamp. Days outside are not like being at home, be careful of people's various treacherous appearances!"</p>

<p>He told me this, and also told me about his past deeds.</p>
<p>And what he told me the most was the story of rushing. In this wild area, there is another kind of flavor that young people do not know.</p>
<p>"Even walking on such a flat road is not easy!</p>
<p>"When you walk the road for a long time and gradually become experienced, you know how to detour, circle, and avoid rugged paths; but, people are getting closer to the end of the road and feel terrible fatigue."</p>
<p>I remained silent. Because of his age, I remembered his words. He had been tortured by a journey in his life.</p>
<p>The broken car bumped like an ox cart, the sweat of the strong man on the long journey being crushed and spat out under the wheels. The front of the car spat out mouthfuls of water vapor and foam with a hiss, panting, struggling as if climbing mountains. Covered in sweat, people felt tired!</p>

<h3 id="e212">United Photoplay Service Tidbits <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>United Photoplay Service's first sound film with dialogue, "Waves Washing Sand," is expected to premiere in early May. The film's director, Wu Yonggang, is currently preparing the screenplay for his new work, "Swallows Flying in Pairs." It is said that this play is specially tailored for Chen Yan Yan.</p>
<p>The location shooting team for "The Lost Lamb" in Suzhou departed in batches on the 22nd and 23rd of last month. In addition to Director Yu, cinematographer Cha Chusheng, Zhou Damin, and all the production staff, the actors include Ge Zaozhi, Chen Juanjuan, Wen Rong, Qin Haiyou, and fifty-eight child actors in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Jin Yan, Li Lili, and Lu Lu play a love triangle in "Going to Nature," but Li Lili is ultimately conquered by reason.</p>
<p>Fei Mu, who has directed many silent films in the past, is highly praised by film enthusiasts for his creativity. Recently, he has begun directing his first sound film, with the confirmed actors: Li Lili, Zhang Yi, Han Langan, and Hong Jingling. It is noted that this is the first time Li Lili and Han Langan have collaborated with Fei Mu.</p>
<p>Wang Cilong ranks fifth in his family. Cai Chusheng's new work planned after "The Lost Lamb," "Wang the Bachelor," will be starred by this Wang the Bachelor, Wang Cilong. However, according to Wang Cilong yesterday, the title of this play is just a joke, and it is still unknown whether a new title will be decided.</p>
<p>Tan Youliu's new work is an extremely serious subject matter, but it is presented in an extremely light and humorous way. The male actors are Zheng Junli, Han Langan, Yin Xiucen, etc. It is said that the role Zheng plays in this play is very similar to Little Li in "Wild Rose," but the play is more important than the one Little Li played.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Zhang Wen and Yao Ping in "Flowers and Grasses" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<h3 id="e214">A Casual Talk About Gu Er'yi's Head <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Gu Er'yi, Du Xiaojuan, Zhao Dan, Ye Luqian, Tang Na, and Lan Ping, three pairs of artists, got married at the Liuhe Pagoda and returned to Shanghai, where they borrowed the ninth floor of the YMCA to feast on close relatives and friends, reaching two or three hundred people. It was truly a grand and lively mass scene, filled with joy from beginning to end, and everyone was smiling. The most interesting thing was when Gu Er'yi stood up to give a speech wearing a cap. Everyone shouted loudly, asking Gu Er'yi to take off his hat. Those who didn't understand were originally wondering why Gu Er'yi didn't even understand these rules. Gu Er'yi immediately asked everyone to be quiet. He pleaded, "I really can't take off my hat!" No sooner had he said this than Jin Shan, who was standing next to him, acted quickly. Before Gu Er'yi could defend himself, he immediately snatched off Gu Er'yi's cap. What everyone saw at this time was Gu Er'yi's head with a square area in the middle that had no hair. He panicked and was at a loss, hurriedly covering his strange head with his hand and fleeing to the back, putting on a French hat before coming out again. After saying a few words, this French hat was snatched off again by the "Master of Ceremonies," Shi Chao. Gu Er'yi had no choice but to hold his head again and hide inside.</p>
<p>Why Gu Er'yi's head ended up like this is a question. But if you tell the truth, it will make you admire Gu Er'yi's spirit of sacrificing for art. It turns out that Gu Er'yi is playing an old and decrepit person in the new Xinhua Company film "Night of Revelry." His original age is twenty-two years old, a very young lad, but he plays an old man on stage. After joining Xinhua Company, Shi Dongshan also wanted him to play an old man, because his portrayal of an old man is so lifelike. His whole body is made up, and even his voice is made up very seriously; but this time, what is particularly elaborate is that this head is also sacrificed. One day, Dongshan was discussing the plot and mentioned that Gu Er'yi's character was a bald old man. When he heard about the baldness, he was stunned, because he thought, "I am the groom now!" But in the end, he made the decision to sacrifice for the film and shaved off the hair in the middle, resulting in his head being in a strange shape and unable to be seen by people.</p>
<p>Here, we must also report some good news: perhaps you have all admired the "Makeup King," Mr. Xin Hanwen, for a long time, and he has also joined Xinhua Company. Gu Er'dao's old man and the makeup for this bald head are all due to the divine skills of King Xin. Not only will you never be able to tell on the screen that Gu Er'yi is a twenty-two-year-old lad, but you can also believe that makeup in domestic films will from now on have a higher level of technique!</p>
