<h3>大可注意的內蒙問題</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>日來內外電訊雖然紛傳着中日外交有轉入正常狀態的趨向。但內蒙情勢反而愈加嚴重起來。這實在是未可輕視的問題。</p>
<p>據田中奏摺上說。「要征服支那。必先征服滿蒙。要征服世界。必先征服支那。」「以滿蒙的權利為司令塔。而攫取全部支那的利源。再以支那的利源做征服南洋各島·中小亞細亞·和歐羅巴之用。」可見我國的滿蒙早在大陸政策者的心目中。而征服滿蒙是完成大陸政策所必經的階段了。「九一八以後。大陸政策者不但實現了征服滿洲的大慾。且把內蒙橫跨遼吉黑熟四省的哲里木盟·昭烏達盟·和卓索圖盟分做了四　興安省。」於是從察綏到甘寗的錫林郭勒盟·。烏蘭察布盟·。和伊克昭盟都有唇亡齒寒之感了。今年春間。偽軍李守信部進佔了察北錫林郭勒盟的沽源·寳昌·康保·張北·高都·化德六縣。把口北的大糧庫和察北的大牧塲供奉給大陸政策者。商都失陷。未及一週。偽軍又進犯綏東烏蘭察布盟。幸虧晋綏軍隊早有佈置。嚴陣以待。他們的企圖。才沒有實現。</p>
<p>但是大陸政策者為完成他們的政策起見。一定要佔領整個的內蒙的。半年以來。他們一方面懷柔封建王公。另一方面又積極作軍事上的準備。因此察蒙方面不但發生了蒙籍中委尼冠洲被刺。和蒙政會保安處科長雲繼先等離廟這些事件。而且商都的飛機塲建築完竣。甘寗各旗的特務機關也先後設置了。</p>
<p>綏蒙各盟旗王公深知察蒙處境困難。前會籲請中央。允許他們另組政委會。在中央指導之下。和察蒙分區自治。團結救亡。中央嘉納了他們的意思。特許他們組織綏遠蒙政會。以治理綏蒙。這種民衆自覺的運動。在我國國防上固有其重大意義。但光是行政上的設施。仍未能阻止大陸政策者對整個內蒙的覬覦的。最近偽方驅使大批匪軍。進襲綏蒙。綏蒙烏蘭察布盟西公旗叛軍阻止石王復職。伊克昭盟醞釀著民變。而察蒙政會委員長德王又在百靈廟遇刺。這些事情。不先不後的向時發動起來。誰能相信其與大陸政策者絕無關係呢。現在侵綏的匪軍。已經擊退。石王已經由綏主席傅作義派員護送回旗。但是內蒙的隱憂决不會就此消滅。整個內蒙一旦不保。則不但西北失去了屛隙。卽黃河流域也岌岌可危。這是我們不可不予以嚴密的注意的。英國哈定紐曼大將說過。「為圖國家生存而奮鬥。須用種種方法。同時協力應什。始能達到目的。」我們深願中央和地方當局。迅籌種種妥善的方法。同時實施。勿使整個內蒙。為東北四省之續才好。</p>
<h3>日本駐俄大使　報吿蘇俄現狀　向有田外相作重要建議　謂須增駐滿兵力以對抗</h3>
<p>（東京）駐俄大使大田十九日下午會見有田外相、報告蘇俄國內情形·國際關係·及其遠東政策等、頗為詳細、並作重要進言、謂蘇俄在遠東整備大軍、日本應强化駐滿軍力與之對抗、又視蘇俄態度如何而可考慮訂立不侵犯條約等和平的處置、大田大使報吿之內容大要如次、</p>
<p>（一）國內情形　蘇俄第二次五年計劃成功、國內物資漸决豐富、工業鑛業農業各方面受史達哈諾夫運動之刺戟、增加其生產數量、又與國民之訓練相俟、國力日愈發達、最近發布新憲法草案、漸决傾向資本主義、</p>
<p>（二）國際關係　蘇俄曾視國聯為反俄運動之根據地、然自其參加國聯以後、蘇俄在歐洲外交界之地位、俄然有利、與法國訂立互相援助條約、又與英國及與法國有密接關係之諸小國、結成親善關係、以强化其國際地位、蘇俄國際關係之展開、與國內事情之變化、均為値得吾人注目之要事、</p>
<p>（三）遠東政策　蘇俄駐遠東軍隊達三十萬人、其在邊境之要塞綫巳經完成、尙有西比利亞鐵路之雙軌工作·巴姆鐵路之建築·工業新都市之建設等、其完成遠東軍備之工作、着着進行中、其實力超過日本兵力甚遠、且蘇俄絕無接受日本要求撤退其軍隊或設立非武裝地域之意、故日本亦要提高軍隊實力、至歐洲方面標準錢、作為外交後盾、（二十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄代表　抨擊日本政策　在太平洋學會席上</h3>
<p>美國加州玉斯美　太平洋學會今日繼續開會、蘇俄代表對於日本外交政策曾加抨擊、謂日人承認其外交政策、因地而異、令人聞之、不勝駭異、蘇俄除和平外、無其他政策現已與十一國簽訂不侵略公的、卽對於日本亦曾提出同樣建議、日本對於共產主義之態度未免奇特、須知共產主義並非出口貨僅能在國內製造、蘇俄從來以為對日戰爭、决難倖免、兩國間之矛盾並未至忍無可忍地步、和平之眞正危險在於日人之思潮、日本地位穩固、故蘇俄對日關係注重貿易、並不希望日本發生共產政變、並信共產主義與資本主義大有和平合作之可能云、蘇俄代表發言旣畢、日本代表繼起答稱、日本亦擬不用武力、解决一切糾紛、並以為創造新組織、藉以眞正維護和平、實屬必要云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）馬塲藏相、以陸海軍對决定國策之眞意及國防計劃、已大體明瞭、卽以此為基礎、檢討歲入計畫、已得到大體腹案、故於二十日上午訪廣田首相、進行重要協議、查各省之要求預算、新規要求達十五億元、若加入明年度基準預算額十六億元、共達三十二億元之鉅、比本年度預算的增加九億元、而歲入方面雖以增稅方法及由特別會計融通或謀官業收入之增加、亦不能應此要求、故鑑於財政之現狀、對於各省之要求、不得不要求相當之讓步、尤其新規案中最龐大者為國防預算、若此問題、不能解决、則其他之國策、亦無從决定、惟政府對於國策、固早有聲明、自然有相當進行之必要、不過雖編成國防第一主義之預算、亦不能不要求陸海軍為相當之讓步、此為首相藏相一致之意見、又關於國策項目、首相藏相根據四大方針、開誠交換意見之結果、已有相當端倪、關於脫落國策、則設調查會研究之、務使各閣員間勿發生顏面問題等、以謀閣內之恊調、决依此方針、於二十一日之閣議前後、與寺內陸相永野海相開第二次田相會議、以國防預算為中心、進行重要協議云、（二十日同盟電）</p>

<p>（東京）决定國策工作、已入於最後階段、各省所提出之國策、其總額為一億圓、經整理後、或稍有增加、緣當初各省所提出亘三十餘項目之總額、達三億五千萬圓、由內閣三長官審查後、决定取捨、復如農林省內務省之土木事業及司法國策、則移歸新要求事項、或則由節减經費與移至下年度等整理、為一億六千萬至七千萬、惟今後自馬塲藏相與各省個別折衝後、國策費之總額或將更縮小至一億圓左右、（二十日同盟社電）</p>

<p>同昌福等四十二家酒行送酒工人、鑒於蘇浙皖區統稅局上海查騐所稽查員無理捕人、視送酒工作為畏途、况工人送酒、係奉行主之命、如有酒精充燒事件、應由行主負責、不應將送酒工人扣留、所以於昨晨九時、在南市毛家弄酒行公所開會、到工人五十餘名、由王阿芳主席、報吿開會宗旨後、當塲議决、要求保障、在未有保障辦法以前、暫停工作、並推派王阿芳等三人、向同業公會請願、提出要求、予以保障、</p>

<p>交涉保障</p>
<p>新聲社記者、時晚晤同業公會委員賀祥生氏、據談各酒行、已於二十日晨、一律復業、關於工人停工、要求保障、經勸吿後、亦於當晚復工、至於保陣工人工作問題、决定二十一日上午九時、由渠與蘇浙皖區統稅局蔣科長·上海查騐所夏股長交涉、因工人係第三者、自不應代行主受過、又本公會已將此次經過、備呈送統稅局、請求對强扣人貨之稽查人員、予以懲辦、並附酒精及土燒樣子各二瓶云</p>

<h3>華絲輸美槪况　國際貿易局發表</h3>
<p>我國生絲、向多銷售美國、最近因日本生絲、輸美日增、致華絲在主銷路、每况愈下、茲錄國際貿易局報吿、我國生絲輸美槪况如决、</p>
<p>生絲輸美</p>
<p>自一九二四年、日絲佔美國生絲進口已達百分之八十一、至一九三四年、竟增至百分之九八、美國生絲供給、旣已全被日本所壟斷、則中國生絲、勢必被日絲排擠、但中國生絲、向多銷售美國、最近祇一九二九年、華絲輸美總量為一四·九〇六·一六六磅、共値美幣六一·五九七·四七一元、情形較好外、其餘無論在數量及價値、均成每况愈下之勢、近十年來、輸美槪况如下、一九二六年、計一〇·二四九·六九〇磅、一九二七年、計一〇·七八七·七七〇磅、一九二八年、計一〇·五二七·四〇七磅、·九二九年、計一四·九〇六·一六六磅、一九三〇年、計九·八八〇·八一一磅、一九三一年、計九·八四六·七六九磅、一九三二年、計二·五三〇·四九四磅、一九三三年、計三·七六八·九三六磅、一九三四年、計一·一〇二·五七三磅、一九三四年、計三·四八四·五九六磅、其中以民國二十三年為最衰落、去年已較見起色也、</p>
<p>美價趨勢</p>
<p>生絲為織物中最貴之原料、每磅須美幣七毛至一元七毛、自人造絲盛行後、雖有若干應用絲織之物、可改用人造絲替代、然尙有許多織物非用生絲不可、美國為生絲人造絲最大銷塲、其市價漲落、亦可左右全世界、近十五年來、美國絲價變化甚大、如一九一九年每磅値美幣九元四角、一九二九年、每磅减至五元一角、一九三四年、平均每磅僅一元三角、現時每磅絲價、仍僅一元六七角上下、其價格如此低落、原因大半因美國許多紡織業停工或减工、及日絲貶價競爭之故、但近年來日本積極减低生絲成本、山政府資助競爭、以保持此項獨占貿易、</p>
<p>絲運方法</p>
<p>美國旣為生絲銷售最多之國、其運輸方法、自以運費之多寡、關係重要、據美國全國紡織工業同盟研究之結果、美國自遠東巡絲進口後、向分水陸兩路轉運者百分之九十九、由水路經巴拿馬運河者僅百分之一、此後趨勢、則漸漸轉向水路轉運者、逐年增加、至一九三四年由水路運輸者、佔百分之九十、而華絲輸美所受最大打擊、（一）日絲劇烈之競爭、（二）華絲本身之種種弱點、欲求補救、應卽注意集中資本、擴大生產、（三）產品標準化、產額規準化、（四）减輕關稅、獎勵出口、上述四點、實為挽救絲業之先决問題、甚願我國政府及工商業注意及之、</p>
<h3>各銀行籌組　工業銀團停頓</h3>

<h3>上海之電影業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商概况之卅四）</p>
<p>據聯華公司估計：一九三三年外片在華營業，平均每片可獲凈利四萬元，則總數為一六，八四〇，〇〇〇元·上海　埠之外片輸入，據工部局一九三四年全年檢查統計，其數目及比例如下</p>
<p>國別　部數　百分比</p>
<p>美國　三〇九　七八</p>
<p>英國　八　二</p>
<p>日本　四〇　一〇</p>
<p>其他　四〇　一〇</p>
<p>此證明外片之勢力集中於上海，而尤以美片為甚。但據外片商中人表示，近來營業已大不如前，一方面由於賦稅增加（計每公尺關稅收海關金單位七分至八分，送京檢查，每五百公尺納檢查費二十元）他方面以市面蕭條，雖戲院座價下跌，仍不若前時之能滿座，故往往有開映一部影片之收入，甚至不足，關稅運費者，其利益總計較前數年須减低百分之五十許。（未完）</p>
<p>此外，關於膠片之供給，機械之製售，及臨時演員介紹所等，亦附述於後。</p>
<p>海經售膠片者，原僅柯達及矮克發兩家，去年新增Duepon公司一家，其中營業以矮克發為最大，年約一二百萬元。</p>
<p>經售機械之外商公司共十家：計亞洲電器公司，禮和洋行，音樂電器公司，羅樂公司，孔雀公司，科學事務公司，西電公司，Cinema　Supply　Gorp．，　jausou　＆Co．，Star　＆　Co等。華商製造者，計有上海公司，光明廠，竄通公司，中華無綫電研究社，電聲公司，石磬兄弟公司，和合公司，亨生公司等八家。</p>
<p>臨時演員介紹所，計有上海電影演員支配所，　鑫，好友公司，明光，明華，金華，星光，南洋，建國，時代影業公司，華倫，建華等十二家。</p>
<p>六、本埠電影院現狀</p>
<p>本埠現有電影院，共計三十四家，其中開映第一輪國產者僅金城一家，開映第一輪外片者計卡爾登，國泰，大光明，蘭心，南京，大上海等六家，開映第二三輪國片者計十一家，第二三輪外片者計十六家，以座位計，第一輪國片座計一七八〇，第一輪外片座計九，七〇〇，第二三輪國片座計一〇，六三六，第二三輪外片座計一五，七五〇。但以國片供給太少，各第二三輪國片戲院，每月仍需開映外片數日，甚至第一輪之金城，亦偶有此等現象發生。</p>
<p>今以外片第一輪戲院每座六角，第二三輪每座二角；國片第　輪每座五角，第二三輪每座二角，每塲頭座平均六成計算，則每年國片劵資收入總數為五，八一二，五六〇元，國片券資收入為一，九五四，八〇〇元。但事實上因國片供給不足，一三輪國片戲院每月平均需有六日開映外片。依此計算，則外片劵資應增為六，二〇三，五二〇元，國片券資减為一，五六三，八四〇元。國片僅佔外片之四分之一。據戲院業中人言，近年外片賣座僅約三四成，國片賣座，平均約四五成，依此推算，近年國片與外片在上海之營業約為三與十之比。（未完）</p>

<p>（四）（二）足籃球秩序排定</p>
<p>大會秩序、早經排定、足球和籃球的比賽、用抽簽决定、足球參加者共十六國、用淘汰制、我們到慕尼克的時候、就接到消息、第一戰就與英國碰頭、英國是足球的鼻祖、所以這個消息傳來、大家都不免垂頭喪氣、本來英國的足球、祇有職業球隊可畏、業餘隊實力也很平庸、可是這次英國的球隊、其中有六個球員是參加蘇格蘭職業循環賽的一個業餘球隊中選出來的、（英國業餘球隊、可參加職業循環賽、並不違背業餘規則）這個業餘隊在循環中名列第三、所以英國道决參加大會的球隊、實力仍是十分雄厚、我隊雖為遠東盟主、恐仍不堪一擊、但是球員中並沒有一個人氣餒、他們深信技術方面决沒有好多差別、躭心的祇是體力不足、因此每天都練習長跑、培養長力、以期八月六日的下午能發揮一點驚人的成績、僑胞方面、也已準備應援預定三百張門券、不到一天、已經銷完、預料比賽的那天、一定不免有一番壯烈的血戰、</p>
<p>籃球比賽共廿　國參加、廿七日上午抽簽、當十八國已經抽定、還餘日本中國墨西哥比國菲律賓五國的時候、第一個抽出來的是日本、第二個簽、拿在一個女子手裏的時候、因為膠皮封得　緊、一時打不開來、這時全塲空氣、頓趨緊張、大家都念著「中國」「中國」、最後打開一看、果然是中國、</p>
<p>這幕秩序、使各國的代表和全柏林的人民都發生極大的興趣、尤其是留德的同胞、更為關心、球員的情緒、也很緊張、準備在上日的下午决一死戰、籃球比賽是用雙循環制、最後選取六隊爭奪錦標、如第一戰能克日本、照秩序表看來、前途大有可為、必能得第四五名、萬一失敗、也還有上進的機會、整個秩序表、因太複雜、從略、每次比賽出塲球員祗限七人、並且規定更換球晨時、換下來的球員、不能再行登塲、所以比賽的勝負、與指導員的策略機謀、是很有關係的、我們的陣綫、要到比賽的前一天、才能正式决定、</p>
<p>（四）（三）監球友誼賽初勝秘魯</p>
<p>籃球隊為探討實力和練習起見、在大會開幕前約定兩塲友誼賽、因為歐洲球隊實力太弱、（德國在歐洲占第三位、但友誼賽中被日本以七十四比六大敗）所以的定美洲的球隊、二十九日對南美秘魯、三十一日對實力最强之美國、</p>
<p>對秘魯的友誼賽、於二十九日下午三時半、在大會籃球塲舉行、日本菲列濱的球員、和美國的籃球指導托Tobin都作壁上觀、我國的運動員和留學生、去參觀的也有四五十人、其餘觀衆、都被擋駕、</p>
<p>比賽以前、大衆都担心這抵歐後第一戰、不知造成怎樣的結果、上半時我們用精銳的陣綫應戰、右鋒牟作雲、中鋒王玉增、左鋒王鴻斌、右衛李紹唐、左衛王南珍合作緊凑、可謂天衣無縫、近攻退守、也是迅捷非凡、牟作雲罰球打開紀錄後、又接濟王玉增射入一球、以後聲勢愈戰愈盛、秘魯隊雖奮勇抗架、但無還手之力、二十分鐘結束、我隊以　十一比十二、遙遙占先、</p>
<p>下半時董敎練派第二隊應戰、使每入都有出塲的機會、最初也是一路領先、造成十二比六的優勢但秘魯隊拚命反攻、連得八分、下半時十二比十四、我隊小挫、總結果四十三比廿、我隊在歐陸初揚聲威、</p>
<p>記者於結束後、訪問美國籃球敎練托平、叩詢其批評、托平說、中國球隊有極好的根基、經極好的訓絲、球藝可稱上乘、但是照中國球隊的打法、比賽的時候、必須要有良好的裁判員、否則必定大吃其虧、記者回憶上屆遠運會與菲列濱决賽時的情形、益佩服托平氏見解的高明、眼光的犀利、不愧為著名的敎練、現在把我隊功勞簿、記録如次、</p>

<h3>七科學圑體聯合年會第三日　植物學地理學又餓新發現　蔣英發現中國夾竹桃科兩新種　楊鐘健發現水龍獸加斯馬吐龍</h3>
<p>中國生理學會開展覽會招待七圑體</p>
<p>（北平特訊）中國科學社·動物學會·植物學會·地理學會·數學會·物理學會·化學會七科學團體聯合年會、今日（十九日）上午在北京大學宣讀論文、又有新發現、下午參觀生理學會標本展覽會、茲分誌各方情形如次、</p>
<p>植物學新發現</p>
<p>植物學會十九日上午十時、在北京大學生物敎室、宜讚論文、蔣英宜讀　中國東南部夾竹桃科之新屬　、新發現之點如、Chune　chites　TsiangChunechites　Xylinabariopsoides　Tsiang種、此植物採自浙江·海南兩處、與Xyinabariosis屬正為折似、但此屬子房之每個心皮內有多數胚珠、排列成四行、而Xylinabariopsis則僅具胚珠四枚而排列成二人、以其幾咸　狀之花冠而論、父與Ehunecbites正相近似、田本新屬於每個花冠裂片生、具有一齒、是其最大區別也、關於Chunechites袋顯着之特徵為、幾輪狀或幾甕狀之花冠、花冠管甚短、每個甚畏而微成鐮刀形之花冠裂片之邊緣具小形之鋸齒、其花盤甚短、在亞科Echtoideae中以Xylinabariopsia屬取相似、本屬敬以紀念中國植物學會會長及中山大學農林植物硏究所長陳煥鏞敎授、</p>
<p>地理學新發現</p>
<p>地理學會十九日上午十時、在北京大學　院、宣讀論文、楊鐘健宣讀一中國獸行類動物羣之新硏究、發現兩　動物、其硏究結果如下、（一）赫氏水龍獸新　、在已修理之標本中、以此為最完全、除完全的骨頭外、脊椎的大部、肩架骨·坐骨·幾全有、　肢骨也大半全有、足骨有若缺的、在世界上尤其是一疊記化石中、照這　完全的標本、非常之少、由其頭骨性質、如鼻孔部位的向上移、長大的嘴部、知道他的確為水龍獸、又由與已知道水龍獸比較、尤其是和前述的穆氏水龍獸比、究有若干不同之點、所以我們定名為赫氏水龍獸、當作一個新種、（二）另一骨架、除上述之完全標本外、尙有一無頭骨之骨架、但也婦於二齒獄科無疑、但這個骨架的各部分最主要的如骨架骨與坐骨部分與赫氏水龍獸頗有不同之點、因為我疑心道個骨架或者可歸於新疆二歲獸、因為新疆二齒獸、只有頭骨、新肢幾全缺、其保存狀况與化石色澤也十分相像、（三）袁氏加斯馬吐龍新種、以上所述及以前所紀各新疆化石、皆歸所謂獸形類、其生活狀况皆在池沼邊、為比較無害之雜食動物、奧此等動物當時共生、有另一兇猛之爬行動物、往往以幼小之二齒、獸科化石為食料在南非有所謂加斯馬　龍、最近此等相似之動物亦在中國發見、共性質亦頗相近、</p>
<p>蛋白質生物性</p>
<p>聯合年會十九日上午十時、在北京大舉新宴廳公開講演、吳憲講蛋白質之生物的性質、略謂我們知道蛋白質是生物的主要成分、已經差不多有一百年了、但是蛋白質化學的構造、化學家到現在還不完全明瞭、所以蛋白質生物的性質、生物家亦無從澈底了解、蛋白質不但是生物的中要成分、而是生物特有的成分凡生物都有蛋白質、凡蛋白質都是從生物來的因此我相信蛋白質一定有特殊的性質、並且這特殊的性質、就是生物現象的基礎、從各方面的硏究、我們知道濾過毒和噬菌體大小通蛋白質分子比差不多、他們的直經以公分百萬份之一為單位、大概是如下、（一）菌體、二十至百、（二）濾過毒、二十五（三）酵素、胃蚤白酵素四·五·甘蔗納酵素九〇、（四）蛋白質牛乳酪、八·三鷄蛋白質四·三、（五）否仁蛋白質七·九、血紅蛋白質上、濾過毒和噬菌體旣、然通蛋白質分子差不多、大小他們身體裏頭不能有許多蛋白質分子並且除了蛋白質之外、不能有許多別的東西、這樣看起來、蛋白質通生物之間相差一定是不遠、</p>
<p>生理標本展覽</p>

<p>新家庭與衛生</p>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師主編</p>
<h3>靑年的致命之傷……</h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃</p>
<p>一個人在人生的歷程上。如是沒有康健的身體的話。是决不會有什麽成功的。康健之對於人生。是足以給予一個人一種充分的氣力。牠足以鼓舞一個人向上而奮鬥。牠不獨可以刺戰我們體內一切的器管。而同時也是我們靈魂上一種無限價値的興奮劑。</p>
<p>我們隨處可以看見許多靑年。都是像着半醒半睡。半死半活。精神萎頹。身心衰弱的狀態。他們正當精壯力健的時候。到已經是這樣『甚矣吾衰』了！我們對於這種悲劇的命運。不得不硏究一下。</p>
<p>據醫學家的觀察而言。靑年哀弱原於手淫是一個最普遍的現狀。故治療手淫——實為靑年健康問題中最要緊的一條。</p>
<p>要曉得精液和血液同為人體內的——體力之本——智力之源。也就是我們的寳貴的生命之力。靑年男女切不可誤犯這種摧殘前程，浪費精力，折損生命的惡習！</p>
<p>過淫為人生大害。手淫則尤過之。因為這種機械的刺戟神經。所以其蒙受之惡影響。首當其衝的。就是神經先被戕害。那全體的神經組織。迅速地表示着精力竭耗的狀態。於是，神思恍惚，精神懈怠。思想力不能集中。判斷力和記憶力都减退了。自信力也沒有了。情緒乖離。易于悲哀憤怒。似息憂鬱症。終日昏懵。如墮五里霧中。頭痛失眠。多夢。遺精。心跳。耳鳴都來了。甚至時發眩暈。眼窩陷沒。面如土色。皮膚蒼白。全呈着病態了。</p>
<p>况且犯手淫的人。因為精液枯竭。多起生殖器的機能障礙。發育不全。夢遺。滑精等。不但使靑年時代的身心俱傷。而且於婚姻和家庭的幸福上都有很大的影響。</p>
<p>然而手淫之害。尙不止此！普通的病象：如腰酸腿軟。四肢乏力。關節疼痛。手指發顫。視力减退。胃部氣痛。消化力障礙。胸口苦悶。血液衰減。體量減輕。全身枯槁贏瘦。神氣黯然。如蠟人院的偶像。毫無生氣。豈不可悲？及其身體日衰。起肺結核（即肺癆）與心臟病等大症時。生命就非常危險了！</p>
<p>手淫造成之危機的挽救</p>
<p>常見我國社會上為父母者。看了他們的靑年子女。身體瘦弱。都以為是勞心過度。或視作先天虧損。却幷不想到他們（子女）會有妄生慾念尋求喪命的那一條路子。糊塗的父母們一時驚憂無措。只曉得注意於補品。那裏知道什麽是適合—或不適合？未加考慮。就藥石雜投。弄到結果。非但毫無實益。損失金錢事小。因遷延時日。反而招受種種弊害。或至不及挽救者。此時非治其病。實誤其生命。豈不可憐？</p>
<p>今依據各國專家治療報吿：除注意一般攝生法以外。須服用下列的數種藥品。</p>
<p>男性患者。根本上的治療。應於同一時候。內服『米美爾補腦汁』Memory　Neurotic及『濃爾童』Well　Tonic兩種藥品。如此。能收速效。早日恢復康健之樂。</p>
<p>『美爾補腦汁』是神經系滋補的原質。『還爾童』是强精補腎的要素。這兩種藥在全世界的醫師。皆認為腦神經衰弱—與性的機能障礙之特效治療劑。上列二藥。非但其效力强大。幷且絕無任何流弊。患者在家自行秘密治療。頗為適當而安全。</p>
<p>女性患者之性的障碍。如月經不調赤白帶下等。其他衰弱症候。都與男性所患相同。應用之藥物。祇需』『美奴寗』Menorrin一種。亦是內服療法。對於女性衰弱。性的障碍月經不調各症。具有特殊效能外。用以治療不姙小產氣血虧損乾血癆病等。也是有確實效果的。所以為保健女性的藥劑中之明星。</p>
<h3>吿訴患白濁的朋友應該知道……　不要把淋菌送給妻子！</h3>
<p>— 香伯</p>
<p>一個男子有了淋病。當急性的時候。固然是知道禁止房事。等到急性症狀經過了。因為性慾衝動的關係。就不顧一切。去行性交。把危險的種子（淋菌）。送給了對手方的妻子。於是純潔的妻子。也遭着不白之寃。做成一個淋菌的保存者。隨時可以再把淋菌回送丈夫。在這樣情形之下。她的丈夫。雖然如何醫治。希望全愈。如果不把他的妻子。同時醫好。就是丈夫完全治愈。只要因一次的房事。仍舊可以再發。所以第一不要把淋菌送給妻子。旣然送給了。還要趕快一同醫治。</p>
<p>依據臨床治療經騐而論。對於淋濁具有特殊功效之藥物。首首推德製91　ANTI－GONO－TAB．（譯名九一八白濁片）因木劑係化學的最微妙的製品。为能剿滅潛伏尿道粘膜內之淋菌。但毫無損傷胃腸腎臟等副作用。故適於長期內服治療之用。達到完全根治目的。</p>
<p>「九一八白濁片」主治男女急性與慢性淋濁，或女性子宮炎症，赤白帶下，以及因淋毒而起之一切變症，如睪丸炎，卵巢炎。均奏著效。本劑除用於治療外。如在宿娼後呑服一瓶。亦可收預防淋病之效云。</p>
<h3>謀殺小兒之消化不良</h3>
<p>— 章元楨醫師</p>
<p>兒童通常都是好飮好食的；這是發育旺盛時期之自然的要求；但須注意不使流於暴食暴飲。若胃腸一起障碍，食物的供給便受妨害，榮妥便不佳良，於是，活動力也因之而遲鈍了。</p>
<p>食下去的東西，若是以那個兒童的胃腸之力能够容易消化，其結果製出的消化產物—榮養渠—當為腸細胞所吸收，更進而藉腸細胞及其他身體諸細胞之力而護成對身體直接有效的滋養料。</p>
<p>反之，在食物中含有以兒童胃腸的能力消化不了的成分時，那個不消化物便要剌戟腸細胞而發生比普通還厲害的腸蠕動，因之就會不痢的。因此，食下去的食物，不能完成牠的做要傷害腸胃的細胞，妨礙那個生理作用，終於弄衰全身的榮養，减少了他的抵抗力，就容易發生一切的疾病。</p>
<p>消化不良之症狀無一定，輕者惟有極輕之泄瀉，常人槪不注意之，重者則可致死。其普通症狀為泄瀉，綠便與凍便，腹痛·嘔吐·腹部膨脹·腹鳴·不能安眠等。重者全更發熱，食量漸漸减少，身體漸漸瘦弱而死，對於消化不良及下痢之家庭療法，除注意一般飮食衛生外。則以內服「敵腸痢藥片DYSETRIN　TAB．為最有效。此劑力能抑制腸管中腐敗菌之活動，幷吸着包裹之而由大便排出體外，因此腸管內未曾消化之腐敗物淸除後，下痢自然停止。同時又可調理胃腸之機能，促進消化，增加加榮養，故「敵腸痢」於腸胃保健上有重大之價値，尤其以治療小兒食積下痢之特效。久為世界名醫所公認也。</p>

<h3>氣喘病療養須知</h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃</p>
<p>氣管枝喘息。一名氣喘。一名痰喘。亦有以喘急。喘促名之者。本病之原因。為發特異呼吸困難之症。由於細氣管枝壁之輪狀筋起强直性痙攣所致。（病狀）恒於夜間突然發生是症。先覺胸悶·顏面蒼白·而呈苦悶之狀·冷汗淋漓·呼吸十分困難·非常努力·且延長而帶喘鳴·腹筋緊張如板·咯出之痰成黃綠色。</p>
<p>（治法）發是病時。令服「哮立平」Holipin　三片（此為成人量）可立刻止喘。轉危為安。若欲根治。預防再發。則當續服至一二月之久。始能痊愈。倘平日息慢性氣管枝炎（卽久咳）者。其　　之抗病力必甚薄弱。且組織萎縮。生理的機能衰退。故治愈較難。必須同時加服「肺活」Phith　Weal一藥。使肺之生理機能旺盛。肺力健全。則久咳治愈。而哮喘自無再發之苦。</p>
<p>（攝養注意）患者須避溫度之急變。忌食刺戟性之物。宜呼吸稀薄之空氣。常為室外之運動。如身體虛弱貧血以及神經衰弱之患者。平日須兼用榮養强壯劑。如「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic　及『康氏生活素」Conbours＇s　San－Vita－Cell等滋補濟之內服。可返弱為强。</p>
<h3>母乳缺乏的補救方法</h3>
<p>— 珍女士</p>
<p>母乳實在是對於乳兒——尤其是七八個月以前的乳兒—的最良榮養品。縱由如何的硏究，如何的努力，也不能發見比得上母乳的—乳兒營養品。</p>
<p>母乳營養的兒童之罹病率，比人工養的（如牛乳喂養等）兒童的罹病率是非常少的。這是稍有衛生知識者所一致公認的事實。</p>
<p>母乳營養兒童旣有如此重大的利益，那末，做母親的就應該使乳汁的分泌旺盛，足以供給嬰兒的食料，不發生困難問題才是道理。</p>
<p>孕婦分娩之後，就要負哺乳嬰兒的責任。倘是在產後，乳汁缺少，或則全無，實為兒之大不幸的問題。</p>
<p>母乳缺乏的原因，多由母體衰弱，以致分泌乳汁的乳腺發生萎縮之故。我們要解决乏乳的問題，第一條件是母親自身必須充分地攝取營養物；尤其是對於製造乳汁的與分泌乳汁的—乳腺—要促進其機能，旺盛其發育，才可以達到乳汁充足的目的。</p>
<p>對於治療乏乳的藥物，在市間尙未多見；卽有一二，也是沒有確實效力的，不過為宣傳之誇言虛張而已。</p>
<p>近有意大利製藥廠新出一種『媽媽多』Mammato。是用母牛的乳腺煉製，幷且配合他種滋養物在內，牠的效力能發育乳房—使製造和分泌乳汁的機能旺盛，同時又補給母體的營養，所以在衰弱乏乳的母親，服用『媽媽多』之後，大槪於一星期左右，就可見乳汁泉湧似的分泌出來，給兒飮用，不虞缺乏；幷且吃了這種母乳的小兒，身體發育健全，對於各種疾病的抵抗力，要增加不少。</p>
<h3>痢疾治療經騐談</h3>
<p>— 徐國章醫師</p>
<p>痢疾一症。為禍殊烈。不僅威脅人類健康。而受其害者。奚止恒河沙數。現本余治療痢疾之成功經騐。謹為諸病家進一吿。</p>
<p>有數病人。就診於余。覺有頭暈，腹部劇痛，食慾呆滯，便中帶有黏液，有時帶血，余卽診斷其為痢疾。檢騐患者糞便。發見極多痢疾變形虫。余囑其服用「敵腸痢」藥片Dys－etrin　Tab．同時幷囑其嚴守飮食調理法。果奏奇效。數日後。便血愈止。糞便漸燥。下痢減少。腹痛等症候爽然若失.逾幾時.再檢查其糞便。則其變形虫已被殺盡。腸部亦為治愈。且胃之機能亦復常態。食慾增進。但仍服以少量『敵腸痢』Dysetrin以竟全功。</p>
<p>據余之臨床經騐。以『敵腸痢』Dysetrin治療痢疾。功效確實可靠。故樂為醫界同仁與病家介紹之。</p>
<h3>肺病病人之危險！</h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>肺病病人之危險，常不在病—而在治療之療法，有一種病人，毫無醫藥常識，因欲求速效，遂誤信友人之勸吿—或誤信廣吿之宜傳，不加審察，即遍購各種藥物。一一嘗試，殊不知治療肺病，需賴人身自然旺盛之機能，使結締組織增殖，包圍病灶，方能痊愈，若以為藥物能撲殺結核菌，則雜投廣吿上在吹亂誇之藥物，對於肺病，非但無益，有時且甚有害，至有生命危險，而延誤時日，枉費金錢，猶其為害之小焉者也，有時有人用此類藥物，亦復見效者，乃山於其人對於肺病之抵抗木强，雖不服藥，亦可自然治愈，幷非藥物之效。</p>
<p>今日最確實有根據之肺病療法。惟有以人力之補助。促進其自然治愈之機能旺盛。（卽增强抵抗力）此外更無確實方法。因病變久困吾人身體。則此等機能衰退抵抗薄弱，而病變蔓延。此時吾人欲挽此危機。當根據上述自然治愈然之妙機，而加以補助。方為適當。此法者何，卽臟器療法是也，故近世結核治療界，一致採用「肺活」Phithweal之內服療法。施與結核病人。補充其機能。而促進其抵抗力。使之旺盛，而達痊愈。故「肺活」PHITHWEAL得世界醫師公認為治療肺癆確有根據切實合理之特效劑。職是故耳。</p>
<p>「肺活」Pith　Weal之成分及效用。本品係採取壯健動物新鮮肺臟與脾臟中提出之。內分泌素—荷爾蒙—混合製成之內服液。其功用能使已衰萎之肺臟機能—返弱為强—促進其防禦力。而使生理的自然治愈之機能旺盛。如組織缺損（即肺有空洞之處）者得以塡補之。同時在病部之周圍。築成鞏固結締織之牆壁。使之硬化。促其疤痕之結合。完全包裹惡魔之結核菌（癆菌）。失其活動。終必使其完全消滅。以至痊愈。故患者於服用「肺活Phith　Weal之後。不數日即感覺精神爽快。食慾增進。咯痰稀鬆。咳疾减少。潮熱·盜汗·皆見消失。倘連被服用。同時幷注意一般衛生療法。定能於極短期內。高奏凱歌。重登健康之域。</p>

<p>新花逼近四十元關</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉續跌十二至十八磅音、印棉暗澹無月外、各月均跌二角至二角半、但入後因紗市回好、且價格逼近四十元大關口、空方亦謹慎從事、盤旋力極大、市氣一定、徐徐回上、但目前天氣順調、利於農產生長、各路消息、棉產榮繁、逢漲時賣戶尚不缺乏收盤時又見萎靡、結果各月比上日收盤價跌一角半、八月跌　角、午後開盤市勢依然疲憊不振、買戶稀少、結果五月比上午收盤價再跌五分至一角、八月獨跌四角半、查資出裕康一千一百担、源大一千三百担、賡豐三千四百担、永裕一千八百担、義成六千九百担、振大一千三百担、合興一千三百担、信誠　千二百担、買進通記一千八百担、聚興三千二百担、森康　千八百担、仁豐三千一百担、泰昌一千七百担、長豐二千担、元一二千担、新昶一千二百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>糧食粉市盤旋中帶疲勢</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近好一角零、遠小六分、坎拿大小一角零、當開價時、本月份已定二十六日停拍、故多空雙方互求了結、初盤曾一度低至一角三分二釐半、九十月份亦殊平平、惟至十二月份，因外行吸戶頗暢、突好一分外、迨至二盤、本月份已入定局、遠期因廠方逐有套出、市氣遂復平疲、較初開回落一分左右、至收盤與前日相較、近期互有二釐半出入、一月份則小去一分、觀察後步、如實銷不起、恐須回疲一點云、</p>
<h3>期麥抵空又漲四五分　現貨廠開一萬餘包</h3>

<h3>河米高貨去路尚旺</h3>

<h3>南北貨糯米枝漲風最勁</h3>
<p>粵產之金山枝、近以新寗輪中途失事、內中運申之貨達四千餘箱、而糯米枝亦有四五百箱、故申市號盤突趨緊俏、如　莊糯米枝竟開至一百元、比升十餘元、扁枝又升一二元、惟上檔元枝較平、上落無多、普通莊以銷路較活、亦升一二元、漳州所產蘭竹枝因近到寥寥、趨勢上展、昨開百餘箱、又升元許、</p>

<h3>坤都倫河畔</h3>
<p>— 巴</p>
<p>通紅的太陽從東方地平綫上升起，風　離開了草原，遠山漸漸地從農　中顯　了。坤都倫河靜靜流着，岸邊胡桐樹的密葉，在太陽照耀下，泛着油光，微風吹動，一閃一閃，像平湖的靜水。胡桐樹林外是一片茂蓬蓬的細葦，把無邊的大沙漠截開。黃沙上配　綠帶，斑點燦爛像一幅天然的圖畫，多麽醉人的原野啊！尤其是坤都倫河的潺潺流水，彷彿誰在奏着音樂呢。</p>
<p>夜裏哥哥着了冷，一醒來就喀喀咳嗽，鍚奎趕急翻皮包找「阿司匹　」，却被哥哥止住；</p>
<p>——不要麻煩，我不會病的，讓駝夫拾掇行李，咱們去逛逛河，逛逛樹林子。</p>
<p>我們四個人，手挽手穿過　叢，嘴裏唱着故鄕的山歌，跑呀跳呀的鐵進了胡桐樹林。我拔了一些不知名的花草握在手中，小范　着樹枝把身子近上去又落下來，最後一次他跌倒草地上大家都不約而同的哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>出了樹林走不幾步就是坤都倫河，我們有說有笑的沿着河畔往上流走，忽然有黃羊（註）從沙灘上跑過，錫奎急忙担槍描準，槍聲響過黃羊已跑轉了方面，哥哥埋怨錫奎瞎放槍，說話間打背面奔過一個騎馬的蒙古人；身上穿着羊皮袍，長辮子打在背後，陽光射過來，他那袍子油膩發亮，彷彿漆過似的。他手裏提着一枝大鳥槍，馬背上還駃着三隻黃羊，走到我們跟前他站住了，卞馬跟我們講話，一口很漂亮的　話　！</p>
<p>小范又啾上了機會，跟他問東問西，我一點沒注意他們的話，却細心的觀察那獵人的裝束。在皮靴里　有灰色的氈襪，兩隻脚顯得挺笨挺笨的。腰帶上佩有烟袋和火鐮，還有小刀，牛角等，好多零碎東西。正說着話，「隻黃羊跑過，那獵人把槍一托，碰的一聲，黃羊呌着倒下，他立刻打開牛角把槍裝上火藥，才跑去揀黃羊。</p>
<p>哥哥因為聽了那蒙古獵人問到「吳佩孚就位了　有！」覺得非常滑稽，帶着好奇心想再跟他談一陣，可是那邊駝夫在喊了，時候不早啦，哦們馬上跑回去。駝夫已經把帳幕行李收拾打點妥當了，於是騎上駱駝，沿着河畔趕路。</p>
<p>經過一段沙漠，西邊伏出一片密林，林外便是無邊的碧綠草原。走了不多一會兒，看見了　　　古抑女在草地上放甡口，那麽大羣呀！有駱駝，有馬，有羊。年輕的女孩子在羊角上紥紅色的野花。羊跳着，　　呌，被羊光弄困倦了的牧人們，仰臥在草褥上閉着眼在幻想着甜蜜的夢。</p>
<p>傍午，在一處茂革叢中發現有蒙古包，我們决定在此處打尖，下了駱駝腿麻得站立不着，活動了半天才得以隨便走動，於是吩咐駝夫支鍋燃飯，我們乘機去看蒙古包。</p>
<p>都懷着希奇和探險者一般，毫不畏縮的向蒙古包走着，老遠就有隻黑狗在吠着奔來，我嚇得藏到哥哥身後，沒時歇打包裹跑出一個女人來，把狗喊住，便笑嘻嘻的把我們讓進蒙古包。地上蹲着一個男子，看模樣有些像漢人，正在剝兎子，立刻丟了手裏的東西，就來招呼我們，　坐　　着女人上來敬熱奶茶，　睛不時打量客人。</p>
<p>我們全坐在佛　的左面，那人抱着孩子坐在下手，男的在右邊的下手坐下，嘴裏啣着烟管。包頂雖有氈窗，空氣和光綫都感到缺乏，而且包內有種奇特的燻臭氣息，我把呼吸的距離拉得很長，跟那男的談了一會兒，就知道了他是漢人——陝西榆林縣，恰巧跟我們同鄉。</p>
<p>從顏色上看去，他有些懷念故鄕了，他問長問短，鄕情在他的肥憶更美麗更可愛戀了。當談到他在額濟納境內留住的經過時，一個五六歲的孩子從氈門窗外邊跑進來，一見這些從未見過的生人，驚奇的撲到母親的懷裏，眼光死死的盯住我們。</p>
<p>——要是沒有老婆孩子累贅，我早就回家去看看了！</p>
<p>問到他往外蒙古去的路綫，他說得很詳細，從此地到索果要了多少時期，什麽堆方有井，一直講到沙倫庫都　和昔拉烏蘇。飲足了茶，我們就吿辭，他送到門　便止住了脚步。</p>
<p>剛踏進葦叢就碰到一個喇嘛：</p>
<p>—你們要往哪去？</p>
<p>—到外蒙古！</p>
<p>—恐怕不大好走，克列地方早就禁止亂人通過哩！</p>
<p>想不到這喇嘛竟會說遺麽漂亮流利的漢話，仔細問他，原來他是熱河人，曾經去過庫倫。我們穿過葦叢，回頭看他，已經進了剛才我們去拜訪過的蒙古包。</p>
<p>駝夫累得滿頭是汗，他有些生氣了，嘴嘟嘟着：</p>
<p>—以後做飯時你們若是丟下不管，我就不幹了！一個人又得打水，又得燒火，駱駝還要　，我怎麽忙得來啊</p>
<p>天空和大　是　　　　，　在駱駝上伸酋會看　不停的流水，草虫羣羣的敲着　膀，在兩岸的草間來　　。駝蹄在硬沙上跋涉。太陽漸漸地西沉，通過沙　　林時，前面又現出了一片草原，黃昏撤着輕淡的光　，駱駝呌了幾聲，我們便開始尋覓有水的地方，半天找不到，沒法又往前走，慢慢的聽見有犬吠聲，一定附近有人家了，這才放心</p>
<p>尋到蒙古使，我們進去，有夫婦兩人已經睡下，另外有五六個喇嘛圍在爐邊說話，我們問他們哪兒有水？一　年靑的喇嘛領我到靑草叢今，裏邊有一小井　，　才得以動手做飯，駝夫把帳，棚打好時，狂風又從沙漢襲來了。</p>
<p>註：黃羊是沙漠上的一種野羊</p>
<h3>悼</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>提起筆來紀念學生，這已經是第二次了。</p>
<p>我來到這裏敎書，有一件事使我感到歡喜，那便是有幾個學生在文　約造就上出了我的意外，我常私下這麽想：如果好好的培植下去，這幾條精英將來一定會親眼看它們開花結實的。誰知道人間的希望往往只是一閃亮就馬上化成一團漆黑了。</p>
<p>去年，那位侯姓的學生因腦膜炎喪生後，我個人不必說了，就是他全級的同學沒有一個不掉淚的，尤其是有著同樣愛好的憲泗。當時把侯君平素的文課選印了一篇，我在末尾加了一段悼惜的按語，分給全校同學做一個紀念，讀了這篇文字的人都不禁的喊道「可惜這樣一個天才！為什麽老天不呌咱這些蠢貨死呢」！後來在作文班上我出了一個紀念侯君的題目，結果收到了全個兒好卷，每個人都是用淚水和着墨寫成的，我也是煎着淚在上面畫一個圈又套一個圈的。記得憲泗的那篇特別使我心痛，他的文字本就是帶些感傷的，這樣一個合適的題目對於他，當然能呌淡墨間開出悲哀的花朶來了。</p>
<p>誰會相信呢，在同一的課本上，在同樣的題目下，於今同學們又要來作文字紀念他呢。</p>
<p>是的，誰會相信呢。就是我這時在對着小燈來寫這篇紀念的文字也彷彿他不是眞的永遠不會再來人間，不會再來這盞小燈下背他的詩句給我聽了。</p>
<p>「陳憲泗的詩一定會大有成就的！」</p>
<p>我常常憑着我號筒一般的快口把這句話到處傳播，傳播給全校一的學生，傳擴給我的朋友，恨不能傳播得呌天下的人都知道這個天才我方高興，這是一點好衝動的感情呌我這麽做。果然，這宣傳奏了效，全校的學生沒有一個人不知道這位詩人了，同班的同學無論和他打鬧或是談正經時，無不一口一個詩人，「詩人」這兩個字簡直成了為他而存在的一個專名詞了。你不要笑，道稱號沒一點諷刺味存在裏邊，而他——陳憲泗，也確乎擔起這兩個字而用不到紅臉。他會在秋的題目下寫出「眼皮上貼一千兩黃金」的句子，他的想像是扎着翅膀的，上帝造他的時候，把他的體質和性情都曾經詩化了的。</p>
<p>他是破落戶家的一個子弟，環境本來就有點難堪，他免强能够出來念書，全仗着他哥哥在這裏作點小事，礎薄薄的薪俸裏抽出一點點來供給他。他偏偏又有一個癖好，好買文藝書。各家的小說，整份合訂的雜誌，滿滿的列在他的那張小桌上，尤其是詩集，他更愛好，去年因為沒買到死水很懊惱，終於破了幾夜的工夫用淸秀的小楷把它整個兒抄成了一個袖珍小本，這樣，他高興極了，今天念，明天念，早晚到了眞是念不懂的句子便找我來了，講說一回，我倆再一齊合讀一回。</p>
<p>他側够寫那麽好的詩，說實話也不全是我的點化的功勞，在我未來之先他便愛上詩了。那時敎他國語的是我的「位好友，有時把他的詩轉給我看，信上介紹道：「你看，詩寫得不錯吧？這是我們的詩人呢。」從這，我記準了他的名子。等我來了之後第一個到我屋子裏來談文藝的便是他。從這個小說家的作風談到那個詩人的格調，從中國談到外國，最後又拉上了一些文壇上的掌故，當時若不是自己比較對這些情形平素也曾留過心，那非被他問得開口結舌而以紅臉下合不可。</p>
<p>從此以後，我的小屋裏常有他的足跡。他的來，說不定在什麽時候，有時晚上已經打罷了睡點，我正忙着在批點卷子，他來了，說不定拿着那家的詩，或是他自己的。這時我把筆管向硯台上一摔，心從一個枯燥的圈子裏跳出來了，帶着從心底發出來的歡喜我們談起詩來，時間忘記過了多長，只覺得口裏有點發乾，等我去倒一杯剛才沏上的茶來要喝時，一觸嘴便覺得已經寒得喝不得了。</p>
<p>切近了我以後，他詩泉的淸流似乎更活潑了。隔不上幾天總要送幾篇詩來呌我看，我眞也愛看。記得有一次，夜已經很深了，我看罷了他的一篇大早，（已發表於文學導報？已經記不淸楚了。）高興的我跳了幾個跳，（那美麗的句子，至今我還能背給你聽！）這一夜正落麻桿子雨，可是那顧得這，於是連傘也沒來得及打便一氣跑到了他的寢室，他這時正獨守着一點小燈打算要睡，我一步闖進去便從衣袋內掏出他的詩來朗誦，誦讀完了，丟下了一大串鼓勵的話一轉身推開門跑了，回到自己的屋子裏來，只覺周身發冷，指頭像十條冰柱，躺下，心一勁亂跳，第二天他吿訴我，他在牀上翻轉了一夜身子。</p>
<p>後來，我把他的詩介紹各處的雜誌和副刋，同時又為他介紹了一些靑年的同好，（於今，他們都印了詩集了。）記得有一次一個編文藝副刊的朋友當面問我：「你為什麽不署眞名，相中了陳憲泗這個筆名呢？」我笑了。等我道出來眞情之後，那位朋友也笑了。憲泗的詩本來是很空靈的，後來受了我點影響，作風有點改變也是眞的。「何必不讓學生自己豎一個作風呢？」對於這個朋友的這句問話，我只好又得報之一笑了。</p>
<p>這班的學生有著結交的風氣，各人有各人的膩友，憲泗是和邢君極要好的，他倆在小學裏就在一起，來到這裏以後更是形影不離了。憲泗的脾氣像無定向的風，高興了不定朝那刮，說眞了，簡直是太小孩子氣了，可是按實說來他還不過是一個十八歲的孩子呢。</p>
<p>有一次他向我辭別來了，他說這就要離開學校，我帶著驚疑問了句「為什麽？」問答的也很簡單，說是功課跟不上！這苦衷我很能了解，一個中學生要把精力注在一點上，那是不可能的。他說數學簡直呌人頭痛，這句話不禁勾起我中學時代受數學難為的傷心來了，我吃過這個苦味，我用種種話寬慰他，想穩住他的心，我說一個詩人不能以光能念詩寫詩，這是不够的。好歹把他獅子般的心說降了。為了他太好文藝弄得功課不能平均發展，我聽過別人不少的閒話，他一定也聽過，旣然是閒話也就可以不管它了。</p>
<p>邢君是他的老大哥，論年紀也應該是。他們住在一口屋裏，一塊用功，一塊遊散，甚至夜裏兩個人抵足而眠。一旦他的小孩子脾氣發作了，那就是邢君磨唇舌的時候到了。在去年春天，邢君忽然我我來了，臉苦喪著？一見我就說「憲泗昨兒忽然剃光了頭，决心要去當和尙呢。」我明白老大哥已是對他束了手，所以又來求我這件法寳了。一個靑年為什麽要削髮為僧呢？這裏有一段小小的故事。</p>
<p>好好的為啥要當和尙呢？</p>
<p>把他呌到我屋子來，我手托著下頦，劈頭就是這麽一句，雙眼緊緊的瞪着他，然而嘴角上是掛着笑的。</p>
<p>「……」一句話也回答不出來，一勁用右手摸着頭頂的那個小白帽墊，雙頰紅紅的想笑又想哭。</p>
<p>「一個人不能太沒準了。你和密司×××的事就是一時成不了功也不能這樣呵，人家對你始終很好，一個為父親的還能隨隨便便把個姑娘一口許給一個陌生人嗎？你眞太孩子氣了！」</p>
<p>我看他的臉漲得更紅了，心也許在跳動吧？</p>
<p>眞的，這個女孩子牽着他的心。他倆的友誼是很不錯的，他的文藝書常常擺在她的枕邊，雖是隔離在不同的學校裏，可喜她的小弟弟做了他的小弟弟（今年，他與邢君之外，出出入人又加了一個小小的孩子。）小弟弟做了傳書遞簡的紅娘。聽說當她父親想把女兒許給另一個人時，道個小孩子哭哭啼啼在家鬧了個大不開交呢。</p>
<p>還有一件呌他傷心的事，（也許是促死的符咒吧？）就是他姐姐和父親的死。為了死去的姐姐，他寫過幾篇悲傷的詩，眞是大悲傷了，我眞怕讀它。破落的家庭像秋風中的敗葉，人逐着窮困漸漸凋零了。有一次，這話說起來還很近，不過兩個月前後的事罷了，出了個「給父親的信這樣一個作文題目，我背起手在敎室中來往的穿梭，別人都在刷刷的向課本上寫些快活的字句，等我巡視到束北角上，忽然發現了他在咬着筆管落淚，突然的一陣心酸，不禁自恨起來，自恨明明這裏邊有剛失去了父親的人，為什麽要出這樣一個題目呢？想到這裏我立刻給大家一個聲明：沒了父親的人寫給母親和哥哥都可以的。說完了這句話我便偷偷的踱向了前方再也不敢把眼向東北轉了。結果，他的信還是寫給父親的，不過上面也有描寫母親的地方—一個老病柔弱的女人，這封信寫得太呌人悲哀了，好在父親已經讀不到它了。</p>
<p>三年的初中這學期就要結束了，他旣然熬到了現在，當然要破死命的去抓那張文憑紙，（他呌它是吃飯證，他對我說：初中畢業就算啦，家裏供給不起我，還需要我來供給家庭呢！）各種功課像一團亂絲」勁向他心上扣，平素他和書本就有點陌生，這時要立刻翻過臉來做成熟習的朋友那能辦到呢。况且考試的難關一層又一層的，什麽星期考，月考，本校會考，省會考。</p>
<p>這幾個月平不大見他的面，也沒有送詩來，我知道這是為的什麽。一月前在作文班上他忽然自動的下來了，我這時正在窗外向著春陽發呆，見他出來我便問一句：</p>
<p>「為什麽跑下來了呢？」</p>
<p>「有點頭痛！」</p>
<p>這樣他便走向了寢室，我望着他的背影，最後一次的背影。</p>
<p>過了兩天餓人吿訴我他回家治病去了。我覺得大槪這孩子又犯了不馴的性子，病不過是個逃避考試的冠冤幌子罷了。他同班的同學也多半這麽揣測。</p>
<p>幾天又過去了。在一個朋友的婚筵上，聽到了他病重的消息，我的心立刻以快樂裏轉入了悲哀。</p>
<p>又過了兩大，在一個晚上，我看了水災電影回來，一個同學突然跑到我的屋子裏來，說是「陳憲泗死了！」這一夜，我緊合着眼，似乎楚淸醒着，然而他的影子却閃在我的臉前，淸楚而又糢糊的。</p>
<p>第二天一早，我馱着一身沈重想登上西城去舒一下心，一出大門，迎頭碰上了一個醉漢，口中吸着烟，雙眼比兩個紅桃，兩隻脚給風吹的東西亂倒，好像一雙漿在急流裏。一見我就放了聲，其實已經哭不出聲來了。我用力架他到我的屋子裏來，把他安放在牀上，打一把冷手巾給他蓋着臉，剛要潑　濃茶給他打一下心火，忽然他打起滾來了，在這情况下，除了陪他掉淚以外，安慰的話是不敢出口的。他雙手捧着頭，脚扣着牀緣，酒氣　透了這間小屋。的摸還沒到二分鐘的工夫，茶還沒來的及呌人來倒，他一憫身子爬起來要走！非走不成！我明白這時任何地方都不能呌他平靜，他要走，以這兒走到那裏，等到了那裏之後，也許又要到別的一個地方。我扶着他，把頭垂着呌淚背着無數的眼睛暗暗的落在地上。……</p>
<p>他入喻的那天邢君沒敢去，怕呌他母親見了兩下裏傷心，據別的同學回來報吿，說他母親簡直是癡了，終天打聽誰家有死了的女學生，一心給他結一門陰親呢。</p>
<p>他入土以後，邢君到我的屋子裏來，送下了兩件東西，一件是憲泗最近照的四寸像片，這是他抱病回家叮囑托邢君交給我的。再還有一本詩，是他自己選的，字跡很美麗，已經是淸稿了，藍墨水字上還有用墨筆改削的地處，題名「我的詩，」揭開第一頁，上面寫着一行字「逝去的夢一般的情緒。」</p>
<p>邢君又吿訴我，他活着時終大希望出本詩。我答應下來，答應將來一定設法給他印出來（由我寫一個序）和我給他介紹的別的靑年詩人一樣也有一個集子。邢君表示他如能僥倖畢了業，再也不念書了。全校的同學又把「可惜這麽一個天才，為什麽不呌咱這些蠢貨死呢」的話重翻一遍，同班同學們追悼他的文字又是全個兒好，可是這回却沒有邢君的那一本。</p>

<h3>諷刺文學的積極性</h3>
<p>— 雷石榆</p>
<p>諷刺文學是什麽？過去「詩歌」四期上有林林君的「諷刺詩的提倡」和曾在申報專刊上發表過張香山君的「日本諷刺文學的勃起」的介紹，然最近「東流」革新號揭載張君的「諷刺文學論」和北鷗君的「關於諷刺文學的感想二三」才引起我的注意。在張君的這一篇論文中頗詳細解釋諷刺文學的發生及其在各個時代的特定的歷史條件下所產生的質的變化，但為針對目前中國的現實，諷刺文學應把握怎樣的武器和策略就忽視了。至於北鷗君的感想離我們的要求更遠，卽他拘泥於對小市民的暴露和諷刺的高爾基的理論，而不根據蘇聯和中國的現實發展過程之距離及客觀情勢的要求而着眼，於是把「感想」狹隘化了。其實在這樣嚴重的中國的局面下，陷於沒落的命運和恐怖之襲來的小市民，那種可憐的寄生的劣根性也要緊張起來了，卽他們也同樣為着自己的生存，在聯合的戰綫上他們也至少由觀望，咒詛而至參加進　攻共同的敵人，不過他們特有的搖動性是　不能忽視的。</p>
<p>且說諷刺文學之產生的社會根據吧。大體說來，當時代的轉換期間，也卽是現存的社會制度自身內包着其矛盾的深化而孕着變革其自身的諸要素日益表面化之際，但一方為持續其殘喘而拼命掙扎，對「變革」的預防和為了消除「變革」，是不惜施用嚴酷的政洽手段的。在這樣的時候，屬於「變革」之一要素的文學，為避免正面的衝突往往採取諷刺的形式作側面的攻擊的。譬如德國詩人海湼的之辛辣的諷刺和俄國詩人白德明之毒　似的諷刺，予與敵人從骨髓裏痛酸起來的。但也有從屬於支配階級的，痛感權貴的無力及共階級的日趨沒落，腐敗，醜惡…而作為哀歌的警鐘地採取冷嘲的，傷感的暴露的諷剌，如莫里哀和果戈里。但更餓站在相反立塲的，對尙殘存着的沒落階級者在新的社會組織下感到不適應自身的新的現實生活而苦悶，而回憶過去的舊夢，空想其社會制度或那生活方式的再現，而結果陷於更可憐的悲境，用奚落作其襄歌的，最顯著的餓十七世紀的西萬提斯的「唐吉訶德」的諷刺。以及更奇妙更　利的餓最近蘇聯作家伊利夫和配托羅夫介著的「十二張椅子」及「黃金犢」等的巨著。</p>
<p>雖然說一諷刺」是起源於一笑」，但這「笑」是有組織的有精神的有技術的笑，唯餓這樣，才能在文學上表現共特殊的一種「諷刺」的藝術。而且這種藝術隨着歷史的推移，社會制度的幾度的交替，其內容及形式的變化與發展，已是很顯然的。尤其是作為目前我們採取的一種文學武器，史有特殊的效能，這效能不用說是根據我們客觀的特殊條件，而要求出新的創造的。</p>
<p>所謂新的創造，是强調諷刺之中題的積極性，主題之諷刺的潑刺性。在我們的熔冶爐的現實上，是沒有出現「唐吉訶德」的滑稽的脚色，也流不出果戈里的消極的淚底冷笑，也未到達伊利夫等的悠然的熱嘲。牠是鍜鍊出康健的反抗精神的，潑刺的，辛辣的，游　隊的武裝諷刺。不但使當前的最大敵人受創透骨的蜂螯，連一切戴着假面具的陰謀者，都要在照妖鏡的强烈底映射下畢露其可憐的形相，而目更要像使夜襲的敵機處處受着高照燈的掃映和高射砲的反擊，這樣，諷刺文學才能表現其積極性，和實現其現階段的任務。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>和平與戰爭</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>火藥氣味瀰漫了全世界，二次大戰的爆發，只待導火綫的燃燒。然而當這各國整軍經武之中，和平運動，却並不因比而且喪。日昨美國和平使者陶達氏，來至中國，勸我們加入世界和平運動。據云該運動的主張有四：（一）條約神聖，惟中國有許令修改之權：（二）限制並减少軍備，革除製造軍火的利益，（三）使國聯加增力量，俾聯合的穩固，與互助的力，更為有效，可以反對侵略，（四）在國聯中設立一委員會，永久存在，以化除並减輕國際緊張的局面，使不發生戰爭。</p>
<p>和平運動，不但無可非議，而且深値得贊成，可是這一運動，在目前並沒有多大的力量實屬徒勞而無功。因為世界各國，正在朝戰爭的道路跑，和平只能任武力去安排。儘管我們疾呼和平，總敵不過殺聲的響厲。和平運動要是眞能阻止戰爭的發生，黷武主義早無用武之地了。世界和平運動的四項主張，是不錯的。然而誰願意實行呢？神聖的條約，一變而為廢紙。國聯也失去本有的力量。這是給武力踐踏的結果，恐非和平運動所能挽回。本來戰爭有戰爭的原因，在原因未消滅以前，戰爭是無法避免的。主張和平的人，應看淸這一點。</p>
<p>美國史家藍森氏，把上次世界大戰，歸在下面四個原因：（一）國家主義與領土回復主義，（二）軍國主義與軍事同盟，（三）經濟的對立與帝國主義，（四）國際的無政府狀態與秘密外交。這是一九一四年的情形，但今日却又是如何呢？這些原因，可說仍然存在。關於此事，我們不想多費言語。事實卽是最好的說明。戰爭的原動力在發生作用了，人類的浩刦，不久便要降臨。在這種危機之中，要進行和平運動，收效的微少，是可以想見的。</p>
<p>不過世界要維持和平，也並非絕對無望。藍森氏說：如果各國能掃除過去的邪惡，不公平與錯誤，忘懷舊恨而重新開始，將來的幸福，當不可限量。我們也可以說，只要一班野心家放棄侵略行為，世界便側太平無事了。可惜這僅是主張和平者的一種奢望。戰爭在有些人看來，或許是神聯聖的。不然，世界為什麽又在大砲的威脅之下，動搖起來呢？</p>
<h3>上海孤兒院印像記（下）</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>他把我引進了一間會議室裏，特別呌人去泡了三盃細茅茶來，於是，便非常謙虛說：「敝院是辦理得十分不完善的，許多不妥的地方還要請指正呢！」</p>
<p>該院創辦於光緒三十一年，迄今已有三十多年的歷史了；到目前為止，統計曾收留過男女孤兒共約二千多人，畢業出院的有四百名左右。而現在該院尙留養有孤兒四百多名，孤女九十多名，年齡最幼者八九歲，最大者十八歲。裏面敎育部份是完全小學，分六級，共有四個敎室；一二年級全日上課，三四五六年級半工半讀。孤兒六年畢業，畢業後或由家屬領回，或由該院代為介紹職業，其中有天資聰明而可造就者，則由院保送至香山慈幼院，或上海南洋中學肄業。該院的畢業生，現服務於商界者為最多數，其次是軍醫學農工報郵各界均有。</p>
<p>課程方面，除小學敎育外，尙須學習各種工藝，俾使每一個孤兒出院後有一種技能，將來能在社會上謀生活。現院中設置的計有美術（包括圖畫塑雕等美作），音樂，印刷，裝訂，藤工，竹工，木工，園藝，縫紉，刺繡，織襪等十一種。但其中女生只學縫紉刺繡織襪等三課，而除刺繡是承接人家委託的外，其縫紉及織襪都是供給院中孤兒自用的。</p>
<p>孤兒進院的手續很簡單，凡是貧苦孤寒的兒童，只要先行向該院去報一個名，如院中有空額，那末先塡具保單送院，得院董簽准後卽可送去。進院以後，一切的生活必需和衣食住，均歸院中供給，院中却並不收費，人家自願捐助者多少聽便。</p>
<p>院中現有敎員十一人，技師若干人，職員七人，保姆四人，全是半盡義務性質的，而院務的整理，各處的淸潔，完全由孤兒輸流服務。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>現在該院每天食米三石餘，平日蔬菜，有一部是採自自己園中者，然而每天尙須向外面購買蔬菜幾担，每月常葷四次，每逢星期日為當葷之期。全院每月的經常開支為二千四五百元，全年約三萬元，其中十分之六是伙食費。</p>
<p>該院並無基本經費，亦無任何方而津貼，該項經常開支，完全是由各界捐助及各院董負責維持的。不過，此外院中也有一部份工藝生產，全年約二千元，亦聊可貼補院中的經濟不足。</p>
<p>那里所出品的各種工藝品，有一部份是批發出去的，還有一部份却陳列於該院門口出售。</p>
<p>藝生中成績優良者，院中照例也給獎賞的，而樂隊出隊應邀的，更有折頭給他們。</p>
<p>張先生談到這里，便站了起來對我們說：</p>
<p>「現在請到里面去隨便參觀一下吧，不過此刻因為放假，一切都很凌亂，孤兒中也有不少已回家去了。」</p>
<p>院中空氣很好，環境也十分幽靜：全院共有樓房四十八幢，平屋三十二間，佔地約二十畝，菜園佔地約十畝。我們沿着一條走廊過去，先參觀過—辦公室，圖書室，醫藥室，一二年級敎室，三四年級敎室，五年級敎室，六年級敎室，然後去參觀他們的工塲。竹工部是在籐工部的對面，美工部就在室內操塲隔壁，外面是印刷部（里面包括鉛石印等），裝訂部就附設在這里。從背後出去，便是園藝部；前面有一個廣大的露天操塲，操塲的對面是膳廳，膳廳分四個，每廳可容二百人，而廳中均有王一亭先生親筆的堂名題匾。膳廳的傍邊是音樂部。木工部在外面。至女生部是在接待室的傍邊，它完全和男生部隔絕的，內計有房屋十多間，刺繡，縫勃，織襪等敎室就附在這里。每部里有技師一人負責敎授，而各藝生却都在埋首工作着，院中是靜悄悄地非常整齊嚴肅。</p>
<p>至於院中各生的生活，起臥作息均有定時，有病時，輕則由院醫診治，重則通知家屬送醫院。他們平日每天三餐，早上粥，午晚均是飯。</p>
<p>院里的房屋，下層是工塲敎室，樓上却全是他們的宿舍。各處參觀了一週，大概的情形如此。</p>
<h3>等生意</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>煤渣</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>在荒郊，在都市的外圈；在那些草棚子裏過活的人們，熱天，太沉滯了。當太陽從天上壓下來的時候，人像落在一隻溫度怪高的鐵爐裏似的，聽憑那熱浪的燻炙。</p>
<p>入夜，天公如果有幾陣風，好了！人就彷彿過了驚蟄後的蛹卵，一個個讚爬出門來，像流星般，散佈在擴大的荒塲中，馬路上，有污水潺汨着池潭邊。</p>
<p>那個時侯才熱鬧呢。</p>
<p>劉榮，——住在又袋角相近有十外年歷史的老居民。他，便這樣生活着，支撑着一個大小四口的家庭。</p>
<p>每到黃昏，他們幹起大部份工作來，他自己把一天拾回來破舊的東西整理着；榮媽子呢，打蔴，縫補針錢。讓阿喜，小金子滾在垃圾堆裏揀他們從工廠旁邊拾來的媒塊。</p>
<p>做大人的老是鎖緊着眉心把全力對付工作，沉靜着。</p>
<p>祗有二個孩子因為媒塊檢得不平勻，互相地嚷吵起來，時常跺脚狂跳着，呌罵着：抓一把腐敗的煤渣拋擲過去。「哇！小鬼種……」</p>
<p>小的一個哭了，阿喜倒反驚駭着烏臉兒，像知過的罪犯，像尊佛一樣怔在屋角裏不聲不響。</p>
<p>「別哭！他不好，……呃！待我來打他！……」爹爹是誰都憐愛的，眞會把阿喜鞭拍一下嗎？</p>
<p>好在這兩個孩子肯依從，過一回，什麽都遺忘了，依舊親熱起來。</p>
<p>「小金子！明天我們上那兒？……今天的地方嗎！太糟，恐怕不會再有……」</p>
<p>「……那麽仍舊到鐵軌上！這邊……」</p>
<p>小金子翻一下靈活的眼珠，表示還得考慮：</p>
<p>「不行！這邊有人干涉……」</p>
<p>「粉廠旁邊好嗎？」</p>
<p>「啐！那裏只有煤渣！拾來幹什麽」</p>
<p>「煤渣……」阿喜腦袋裏最憎惡這東西，他也狠狠地痛駡了一口。</p>
<p>夜，深下去，入聲靜呢，二個小孩子幹了一天生活，此刻有點朦朧，是應該打睡的時候了！</p>
<p>天明，還得比爹早出戶門，預備去找煤塊去。</p>
<p>一天，兩天……熱浪緊緊逼人，依舊如前。可是，大的工廠正因為是暑天；停工的停工，無力維持的關閉下來，廠房上的汽笛聲，已沒有以前那麽密切而響亮，早晨難得受幾聲驚擾就算了。然而媒塊呢，一天天少下去，就是煤渣，也不能遍地可以觸着人的脚底。</p>
<p>阿喜，小金子，他們焦慮了。五六百鈿一天穩拿的收入，現在已打了個折扣，有幾天，甚至一天的找尋，得不到代價。</p>
<p>劉榮呢，單靠他一人每天跨過河浜去找活，也很難。近來，他也為了暑天，中午一陣，很想躱避過去，然而生活的鞭子無形在敲繫他，如何再不凛心？</p>
<p>「怎麽辦，煤塊近來又沒有了！你們……」</p>
<p>這天晚上劉榮回來把一個淺筐子放在壁角裏，他歎說着。榮媽子哭喪着臉，退後去倒在竹榻上沒有開口。</p>
<p>阿喜的小臉起着靑腫，右臉比起那邊來，要大上一塊肉。</p>
<p>「爹！今天小金子到媒堆棧邊，趁沒有人在，他……他捧了一塊。……那知半腰裏搶出一個人來，他……他抓住我打……我受他三下子嘴巴，弟第靈活……他沒有……」阿喜捧着靑腫的臉哭訴：</p>
<p>「你們……　！要淸白啊！別如此……放膽，」</p>
<p>「爹！明天我們要去檢媒渣了，煤渣裏有媒屑，可以賣給人家生火，……不過，價錢不大！」</p>
<p>「那也好！」</p>
<p>劉榮忍不住兩下水滴落到乾　的層皮邊，那喉頭哽塞了，嗓子低沉得像受了重感胃一樣不宏亮……</p>
<p>草棚裏，其他什麽也彷彿吃驚似的恬靜着，所有的，是他們四口子的慘歎</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Discusses Reorganizing Guangdong's Currency System; Three Measures Determined and to be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>(Jiujiang) According to a telephone call from Guling, Minister Kong made a statement to the Central News Agency reporter on the 20th regarding the reorganization of Guangdong's currency system: The soundness of a country's currency system is related to the prosperity and decline of the national economy. If the currency system is good, prices will be stable, and the national economy will develop along a normal track. International trade will also be in a favorable position and able to balance. Otherwise, if the currency system is bad, prices will rise and fall sharply, and all industries, commerce, and the people's livelihood will suffer greatly. International trade will often be in an unfavorable position, imports will increase, capital will flow out, and people will be impoverished. Therefore, in recent years, in order to cope with the economic panic and seek to enrich national strength, countries around the world have first sought to stabilize the currency system. England and the United States are examples of its obvious success. Our country implemented the legal tender policy last year, based on this intention. Finance has been stabilized, the economy has gradually become more active, and the credit of the national currency has also increased day by day. This is seen by Chinese and foreigners. Guangdong has the earliest foreign trade and the largest number of overseas residents. For a hundred years, people from Guangdong have sailed overseas and remitted their hard-earned money back to the motherland at any time. The development of all regions in the world has traces of the efforts of the pioneers of our Guangdong Province. Therefore, in terms of increasing the national economy, promoting national culture, and introducing international knowledge, Guangdong is the most important province in the country. If Guangdong has a good currency system, then with such a large number of overseas Chinese and such a diligent population in the province, its economic progress will be limitless. Unfortunately, in the past, Guangdong's finances were ignorant of the relationship between currency and the economy. Last year, when the central government implemented the legal tender, they took advantage of the good name of the legal tender to pursue their private plan of issuing silver notes indiscriminately. Although the Issuance and Custody Committee was established, it did not replenish the reserve in accordance with the central government's regulations. According to reports, the amount issued in November last year was only more than 40 million yuan in silver notes. By mid-July this year, the total amount issued that could be accounted for reached a huge 249 million yuan. All cash reserves only accounted for 43%, and the 92 million yuan in provincial treasury bonds used as guarantee reserves did not have a solid foundation. That is, each yuan of silver notes only had a reserve of 43 cents. As a result, credit was lost, exchange rates became abnormal, and people were panicked. The central government, considering the livelihood of the people in Guangdong Province, tried its best to save them. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to assist in the reorganization, but the Guangdong authorities remained hesitant and unable to accept it. After Guangdong received the central government's decrees, the Ministry of Finance immediately sent Vice Minister Zou and Director Song, together with leaders of the financial community and economic experts, to Guangdong to investigate the actual situation and prepare a report. The Minister carefully reviewed it and drafted a plan, sending personnel to Guangdong to present it to President Chiang. According to various documents and telegrams, people have been requesting the determination of the exchange rate, although opinions differ, their intention to improve the currency system is the same. The central government has long understood the suffering of the people in Guangdong Province. Today, the way to reorganize the currency in Guangdong should take the interests of all the people of Guangdong as a prerequisite, and should not focus on the gains and losses of a few people. It is also necessary to strictly prevent the past indiscriminate issuance of banknotes and improper trading. If the currency value is too low, the purchasing power of those who hold silver notes will be reduced. However, if the currency value is too high, Guangdong's imports will inevitably increase, remittances from overseas Chinese will be stagnant, capital will take the opportunity to escape, and the balance of payments will be unfavorable. All of these reasons have been detailed above. Now, the Guangzhou Branch of the Issuance Reserve Committee has been established in accordance with the central government's regulations. Cash reserves for silver notes are being counted, and issuance accounts are being audited. In order to confirm the credit of silver notes, the 17% shortage of cash reserves, which is more than 40 million yuan in silver currency, and the 40% guarantee reserve, which is fully 100 million yuan in silver currency, should be supplemented first to meet the legal requirements. Although the national treasury is not abundant, for the benefit of the people of Guangdong, the central government has to find ways to raise funds, issue public bonds, and make up the reserves to stabilize the market and relieve the people's hardship. During the period of counting cash, auditing accounts, and thoroughly investigating the correct number of silver notes issued and issuing public bonds, the following specific measures are temporarily determined: (1) The total amount of silver notes issued by the two banks in Guangdong Province and the city, totaling 249,580,000.01 yuan, will continue to be used for receipts and payments as usual. (2) All tax revenues that were based on the central legal tender will continue to be handled as before. If there is no legal tender, it should be calculated according to the market price of the day and offset, but it should not exceed an additional 5% (that is, one yuan of central legal tender should not exceed 1.5 yuan of silver notes at most). (3) The calculation method will be implemented separately by the Ministry of Finance on a regular basis. From now on, the reserves of silver notes have been replenished, the interests of the noteholders are guaranteed, and the stability of prices and the development of the social economy can be expected. After the procedures to be handled are completed, the Ministry of Finance will properly determine the exchange method and implement the legal tender, so that the national currency system will be unified, and the welfare of the people of Guangdong can be permanently guaranteed.

(20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe and his entourage returned to Tianjin from Beiping at 7:00 PM on the 20th. Secretary Mutō and Hanawa of the Beiping Embassy came with him. At 8:00 PM, Tashiro hosted a banquet at his residence, and invited the representatives and staff of the Army, Foreign Affairs, and Navy ministries who came to Tianjin to accompany him. It was decided to invite the heads of Chinese economic and industrial leaders of the Tianjin Money Industry Association, Banking Association, and Municipal Chamber of Commerce to a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 21st to exchange views on economic cooperation. Key figures from the military and South Manchuria Railway, such as Ishimoto and Sogō, will also participate. There will be a welcoming party hosted by the Gongyi Association at 7:00 PM on the 21st.

Kawagoe will leave Tianjin for Jinan to visit Korea at 8:15 PM on the 24th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese military attachés from various places arrived in Tianjin one after another on the morning of the 20th. Those who have arrived include Imai from Beiping, Ōmoto from Zhangjiakou, Hosoki from Tongzhou, Kuwabara from Yulin, Habayama from Suiyuan, and Kawano, Ishino, Hiramatsu, and Hamada, who arrived late at night. The Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry representatives held a central meeting, deciding to open at 8:00 AM on the 21st, rest at 12:00 noon, and continue at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, ending at 6:00 PM. In addition to the original agenda, the following were added: 1. Determine the working direction of each military attaché in the future; 2. Tashiro and Hashimoto will give instructions to each military attaché according to the opinions of the headquarters; 3. Conduct a concrete discussion on the North China regime; 4. Listen to important statements and opinions from each military attaché. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kawagoe hosted a return banquet for Chinese military and political leaders at the Japanese Embassy this afternoon. Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, Chen Zhongfu, Chen Juesheng, and more than 20 others participated. Kawagoe left Beiping for Tianjin this afternoon with Secretary Ogiwara and Hoshida. Kawagoe told European and American reporters that he had discussed several issues with Song during this visit: (1) The issue of economic cooperation in North China should be based on local stability and our standards. If the Chinese authorities want to cooperate with other parties for investment and development, I would not object. However, the Japanese side has a more thorough understanding of China in history and the actual situation, so it is more appropriate for the Japanese side to invest in cooperation. When I met with Song, there was a discussion on principles, and Song expressed his approval, but there was no concrete decision. (2) On the issue of anti-communism, the Hebei-Chahar authorities are working hard to strictly prevent and suppress it. (3) Smuggling is happening everywhere along the Chinese coast. It is heard that the Nanjing government is studying reducing it. If the income tax is implemented, there may be appropriate measures for customs duties. (4) On the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, the three principles of Hirota are only the Japanese government's hopes for China. Even if the Chinese authorities do not recognize them, it is not impossible to find another way to negotiate when necessary. (5) My meeting with Yin Rugeng in Tianjin was just a normal courtesy and did not discuss anything else. Finally, European and American reporters asked whether the Jidong organization would be abolished in the future. Kawagoe did not give a concrete answer. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Staff Officer Wachi said that the content of the meeting convened by Tashiro and Kawagoe on the 17th was nothing more than hoping to preserve the special status of North China in politics and diplomacy. After Kawagoe returns to Shanghai to convene a meeting of consuls in South China, he will go to Beijing based on this to present his case. The meeting on the 21st will still focus on this discussion. The military is not emphasizing economic cooperation in North China, and is still determined to have the Hebei-Chahar Council as the main force. Japanese investment will proceed if it is accepted, otherwise it can be left undone. The situation in eastern Suiyuan is still calm. I will go to investigate within a few days. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Electricity Joint-Stock Company Established; Jointly Operated by China and Japan; Zhang Zizhong Serves as Chairman of the Board</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Sino-Japanese joint venture Tianjin Electric Power Co., Ltd. was established at 11:00 AM on the 20th at the former Ningguan residence on Haihe Road, Tianjin.

The Japanese side conducted several investigations, formulated a plan, and Sogō came to Tianjin to promote it. The Tianjin Special District No. 1 Electric Lighting Plant will be planned by the company. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The articles of association of the Sino-Japanese joint venture Tianjin Electric Power Company consist of seven articles. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ma Yanchong hosted a banquet at the Municipal Government Garden at 12:00 noon on the 20th on behalf of Zhang Zizhong to entertain Sogō and members of the Xingzhong Company Tianjin Branch.

In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, he rested due to fatigue and refused to see guests. Qingye of the Xingzhong Company Tianjin Branch said that the Sino-Japanese operation of the electric power business in Tianjin is one of the company's trials of economic development in North China. If it is successfully operated in the future, Hebei Province cotton production, agricultural experiment farms, and rural cooperatives are all scheduled plans, but it is not yet time to implement them. The three representatives Kagesa, Nakamura, and Ota will stay in Tianjin for three days, then go to Beiping to visit various parties, and go to Tongzhou for investigation before returning to their country to report. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Xingzhong Company's plan to develop the Longyan coal mine has been decided to continue to use the name of Sino-Japanese joint venture. The company has sent Director Hirayama and Changchuan stationed in Tianjin to jointly plan economic development matters with Qingye, the director of the Tianjin branch. Sogō will go to Beiping next week to talk with Song Zheyuan. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sogō said that the electric power business is a major condition for economic development. Sino-Japanese joint venture Tianjin Electric Power Company aims to provide the city with electricity at low prices to promote the prosperity of general industry. This is the precursor to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and the progress is particularly smooth. The capital is 8 million yuan, divided into 160,000 shares. The first 4 million yuan will be collected to start construction of a 20,000-kilowatt power plant in Special District No. 1. In the future, the current of the Japanese Concession will also be supplied by the plant. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As a pioneer of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the Tianjin Electric Power Company, a Sino-Japanese joint venture that the Tianjin Municipal Government and the Xingzhong Company have been eager to establish, has now completed all preparations.

<h3>Eleventh Anniversary of Liao Zhongkai's Martyrdom; Central Government Holds Commemoration; Zhou Fo Hai Reports on Liao's Revolutionary Spirit</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held a commemoration ceremony for the eleventh anniversary of Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom in the auditorium at 8:00 AM on the 20th.

The meeting began at 8:00 AM with music. Chairman Zhou Fo Hai led the participants to pay their respects, present wreaths in front of Liao Zhongkai's portrait, and observe a three-minute silence. Zhou Fo Hai then gave a report, stating that Mr. Liao sacrificed himself for the party's struggle in those years, and his spirit is worthy of our emulation. Looking back at the revolutionary environment at that time, it was very dangerous, with enemies outside and the Communist Party and warlords inside. However, Mr. Liao resolutely took on the party's heavy responsibilities with a spirit of perseverance, and firmly advocated the unification of the party's leadership and the unification of military, political, and political orders, without changing his will slightly, which was resented by all those with reactionary thoughts and ulterior motives, who did not hesitate to resort to despicable means to slander Mr. Liao. But Mr. Liao knew this, and was determined not to avoid personal sacrifice, but only sought the realization of his proposals, so Mr. Liao finally died as a martyr, but his proposals and career eventually succeeded. This spirit of perseverance is worthy of our model. After the speech, the ceremony was completed and the meeting was adjourned. (20th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The situation in eastern Suiyuan has gradually become tense in recent days. The vanguard of the puppet Mongolian army is the bandit army of Wang Ying. Behind them is the puppet army of Li Shoushin. The strategy adopted is to advance step by step. The contacts in Pingdiquan and other places in recent days are only small conflicts on the outpost line and not formal fire. The war will break out in mid-September. Our army has fully understood the puppet bandits' plan and has now strengthened the bunkers and is on strict alert. It will be extremely difficult for the puppet bandit army to succeed if they take action. (20th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Significant Attention Should Be Paid to the Inner Mongolia Problem</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Recent domestic and international telegrams have conveyed a tendency towards normalized Sino-Japanese diplomacy. However, the situation in Inner Mongolia is worsening. This is a problem that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>According to the Tanaka Memorial, "To conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. To conquer the world, we must first conquer China." "Use the rights in Manchuria and Mongolia as the command tower, seize all of China's resources, and then use China's resources to conquer the islands of Southeast Asia, Central and Small Asia, and Europe." It is evident that our Manchuria and Mongolia were long in the minds of the Continental Policy advocates, and conquering Manchuria and Mongolia was a necessary stage in completing the Continental Policy. "After the September 18th Incident, the Continental Policy advocates not only realized their great desire to conquer Manchuria, but also divided the Horqin League, Josutu League, and Jolim League, which straddled the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol in Inner Mongolia, into four Xing'an Provinces." As a result, the Xilingol League, Ulanqab League, and Ih Ju League from Chahar-Suiyuan to Gansu-Ningxia felt a sense of imminent danger. In the spring of this year, the puppet army of Li Shou-hsin occupied the six counties of Guyuan, Baochang, Kangbao, Zhangbei, Gaodu, and Huade in the Xilingol League of northern Chahar, offering the great granary of northern Kou and the great pasture of northern Chahar to the Continental Policy advocates. Within a week of Shangdu's fall, the puppet army invaded the Ulanqab League in eastern Suiyuan. Fortunately, the Jin-Sui troops had made early arrangements and were prepared, and their attempt was not realized.</p>
<p>However, to complete their policy, the Continental Policy advocates must occupy the entire Inner Mongolia. For the past six months, they have been appeasing feudal princes on the one hand and actively preparing militarily on the other. Therefore, in the Chahar-Mongolia area, not only did the assassination of Mongolian Central Committee member Ni Guanzhou and the departure from the temple of Yun Jixian, the section chief of the Security Department of the Mongolian Political Council, occur, but also the Shangdu airfield was completed, and special agencies in various banners of Gansu-Ningxia were successively established.</p>
<p>The princes and nobles of various leagues and banners in Suiyuan and Mongolia are well aware of the difficulties faced by Chahar-Mongolia. They previously appealed to the Central Government, requesting permission to form another political committee, under the guidance of the Central Government, to govern autonomously in separate districts from Chahar-Mongolia and to unite to save the nation. The Central Government approved their request and specially allowed them to organize the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council to govern Suiyuan and Mongolia. This popular self-awareness movement has great significance for our national defense. However, administrative measures alone cannot stop the Continental Policy advocates' coveting of the entire Inner Mongolia. Recently, the puppet regime drove a large number of bandits to attack Suiyuan and Mongolia. Rebel troops in the West Sunid Banner of the Ulanqab League in Suiyuan and Mongolia prevented Shi Wang from returning to his post. Civil unrest was brewing in the Ih Ju League. And De Wang, the chairman of the Chahar-Mongolia Political Council, was assassinated in Bailingmiao. These events, happening one after another, who can believe that they have nothing to do with the Continental Policy advocates? Now the bandit troops invading Suiyuan have been repelled, and Shi Wang has been escorted back to his banner by Fu Zuoyi, the chairman of Suiyuan. However, the hidden worries of Inner Mongolia will not be eliminated. Once the entire Inner Mongolia is lost, not only will the Northwest lose its buffer, but also the Yellow River basin will be in imminent danger. This is something we must pay close attention to. British General Harding Newman said, "To strive for national survival, we must use various methods and cooperate at the same time to achieve our goals." We sincerely hope that the central and local authorities will quickly develop various appropriate methods and implement them at the same time, so that the entire Inner Mongolia will not become a continuation of the four northeastern provinces.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Ambassador to Russia Reports on the Current Situation in Soviet Russia and Makes Important Recommendations to Foreign Minister Arita, Saying That the Military Strength Stationed in Manchuria Must Be Increased to Confront It</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ambassador to Russia, Ota, met with Foreign Minister Arita on the afternoon of the 19th to report on the domestic situation in Soviet Russia, international relations, and its Far Eastern policy, in considerable detail, and made important recommendations, saying that Soviet Russia is preparing a large army in the Far East, and Japan should strengthen its military strength stationed in Manchuria to confront it. Depending on the attitude of Soviet Russia, a non-aggression treaty or other peaceful measures could be considered. The main points of Ambassador Ota's report are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Domestic Situation: The Second Five-Year Plan of Soviet Russia has been successful, domestic materials are gradually becoming abundant, and various aspects of industry, mining, and agriculture have been stimulated by the Stakhanovite movement, increasing their production volume. Along with the training of the people, national power is growing day by day. Recently, a new draft constitution was announced, gradually leaning towards capitalism.</p>
<p>(2) International Relations: Soviet Russia once regarded the League of Nations as a base for anti-Russian movements, but since its participation in the League of Nations, Soviet Russia's position in European diplomacy has suddenly become advantageous. It has concluded a mutual assistance treaty with France, and formed friendly relations with Britain and various small countries closely related to France, to strengthen its international position. The development of Soviet Russia's international relations and the changes in domestic affairs are important matters that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>(3) Far Eastern Policy: Soviet Russia has 300,000 troops stationed in the Far East, and its line of fortresses on the border has been completed. There is also the double-tracking of the Siberian Railway, the construction of the BAM Railway, and the construction of new industrial cities. Its work to complete its military preparations in the Far East is proceeding steadily, and its strength far exceeds Japan's military strength. Moreover, Soviet Russia has no intention of accepting Japan's request to withdraw its troops or establish a demilitarized zone. Therefore, Japan must also increase its military strength, with the standard of money in Europe as a diplomatic support. (20th Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Criticizes Japanese Policy at the Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>Yosemite, California, USA The Pacific Conference continued today. The Soviet representative criticized Japan's foreign policy, saying that the Japanese admit that their foreign policy varies according to the place, which is astounding. Soviet Russia has no other policy than peace and has signed non-aggression agreements with eleven countries, and has also made the same proposal to Japan. Japan's attitude towards communism is rather strange. It must be known that communism is not an export product and can only be manufactured domestically. Soviet Russia has always thought that a war with Japan is difficult to avoid. The contradictions between the two countries have not reached an unbearable point. The real danger to peace lies in the thinking of the Japanese people. Japan's position is stable, so Soviet Russia's relations with Japan focus on trade and does not hope for a communist coup in Japan, and believes that communism and capitalism have great potential for peaceful cooperation. After the Soviet representative finished speaking, the Japanese representative responded that Japan also intends to resolve all disputes without using force, and believes that it is necessary to create new organizations to truly maintain peace.

<h3>Japanese Naval and Army Plans, Minister of Finance Will Demand Concessions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy's budget has always focused on the implementation of the first and second supplementary plans and the improvement of capital ships. However, from next year onwards, it will focus on expanding new military preparations such as building replacement ships, preparing auxiliary ships, and strengthening the air force, and establishing a national defense to deal with the US naval power in 1941. The Navy authorities have implemented two supplementary plans to make up for the inferiority of the naval power to Britain and the United States, and have been carrying out the transformation of capital ships since Showa 10. The three-year plan will be completed in its main part by the end of this year. Therefore, from next year, the final part of the three-year plan will be implemented, such as the transformation of aircraft carriers, auxiliary ships, and other works. From the year after that, the surplus of the budget will be used exclusively to implement new military preparations such as building capital ships and other new warships, and increasing the air force. (20th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army authorities plan to save as much as possible in the Army budget for next year in order to enrich national defense, reform general administration, and stabilize the people's lives. Minister of the Army Terauchi discussed the issue of the scope of savings in the Army budget with Major General Umezu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Isoya, and Director of the Financial Affairs Bureau Hirate on the afternoon of the 19th. (20th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Finance Baba has a general understanding of the true intentions of the Army and Navy in determining national policy and national defense plans. Based on this, he has reviewed the revenue plan and has obtained a general draft. Therefore, he visited Prime Minister Hirota on the morning of the 20th to conduct important consultations. The budgets requested by various provinces are as high as 1.5 billion yuan for new requests. If the base budget of 1.6 billion yuan for next year is added, it will reach a total of 3.2 billion yuan, an increase of 900 million yuan compared to this year's budget. Although methods such as increasing taxes and raising funds from special accounts or seeking increased revenue from government industries are used, this request cannot be met. Therefore, in view of the current state of finance, it is necessary to demand considerable concessions from various provinces. In particular, the largest of the new projects is the national defense budget. If this problem cannot be resolved, other national policies cannot be decided. However, the government has long declared its national policy and naturally needs to proceed accordingly. However, even if a national defense-first budget is compiled, it is impossible not to demand considerable concessions from the Army and Navy. This is the unanimous opinion of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance. In addition, regarding the national policy items, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance exchanged views frankly based on the four major policies, and considerable clues have been obtained. Regarding the national policies that have fallen out, a research committee will be established to study them, so that there will be no loss of face among the cabinet members, etc., in order to seek coordination within the cabinet. It has been decided to follow this policy and hold the second Tianxiang Conference with Minister of the Army Terauchi and Minister of the Navy Nagano around the cabinet meeting on the 21st to conduct important consultations centered on the national defense budget. (20th Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Content of Japan's National Policy Items Has Been Decided, Totaling 350 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hirota and Minister of Finance Baba met today and, based on the four major policies for deciding national policy, most of the contents of the national policy items, except for two or three remaining items, have been decided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National Defense Policy: The strengthening of the Army and Navy's national defense should be recognized as a priority.</p>
<p>(2) Reorganization of the Tax System (including tax increases): The central and local governments will uniformly implement fundamental reorganization of the tax system.</p>
<p>(3) Promotion of Industry and Trade: Fuel and raw material national policy, state-owned electricity, promotion of trade, and aviation national policy.</p>
<p>(4) Stabilization of National Life: Extending the length of compulsory education, insurance national policy, reorganization of rural debt, and the local finance transfer system.</p>
<p>In addition, national policies that are being studied include facilities related to arable land issues, disaster relief facilities, civil engineering national policy, immigration national policy, expansion of foreign affairs agencies, and so on. Whether these undecided national policies should be considered national policies or should be considered budgets and requests should be decided after consultation between the Minister of Finance and the minister in charge. In addition, the Ministry of Justice's enrichment fees and the Ministry of Communications' maritime transport national policy will likely be requested as additional budgets for general policies in order to handle them. (20th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The work of deciding national policy has entered the final stage. The total amount of national policies proposed by various provinces is 100 million yuan. After reorganization, it may increase slightly. The total amount of more than 30 items proposed by various provinces at the beginning reached 350 million yuan. After review by the three chief cabinet secretaries, the decision was made to accept or reject them. The civil engineering projects of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Home Affairs and the judicial national policy were transferred to new requests, or reorganized by reducing expenses and transferring them to the next fiscal year, to 160 million to 170 million yuan. However, after Minister of Finance Baba individually negotiates with various provinces in the future, the total amount of national policy expenses may be further reduced to around 100 million yuan.

<h3>If a World War Breaks Out, the US and Canada Will Inevitably Be Involved, the Defense of Canada and Australia Is Important</h3>
<p>Toronto, Canada Lord Iliffe, president of the Federation of British Empire Chambers of Commerce, said in a speech to various Canadian and British Empire clubs today that the United States and Canada could not avoid being caught up in the vortex of a world war. Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have each prepared their own air defenses, so the issue of Canadian air defense is extremely important. Iliffe also said that Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, and Vancouver in Canada are all within the range of incendiary bombs dropped by aircraft with a range of 5,000 miles. He now believes that Canadians do not have a complete understanding of the dangerous situation of the coastal areas of Canada. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Will Be Appointed as Ambassador to the United States, the US Has Not Expressed Anything</h3>
<p>(Washington) Personnel at the Chinese Embassy here declined to comment on the news from Nanjing that former Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Zhengting would succeed Shi Zhaoji as the Chinese Ambassador to the United States. They only knew that Shi had requested leave from his government and was willing to resign and return to his country. Ambassador Shi is currently vacationing in Bair Schülvenez, and State Department officials are also keeping silent about this news. However, it is heard that Dr. Wang has a very good reputation in Washington and has many friends. He recently traveled to the United States in the capacity of director of the Far East region of the International Rotary Club and is now in Germany. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Military Court Continues to Hear Anti-Government Case, Defendants Confess to Plotting to Harm Stalin, Trotsky Makes Grand Statements Abroad</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The military judge of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union publicly tried 14 Soviet counter-revolutionaries, including Zinoviev, today. The chairman was Oulirik, and the Soviet state lawyer Vishexinsky served as the prosecutor. All defendants refused lawyer defense. The chairman then declared that the defendants had the right to accept lawyer defense. According to the indictment, all defendants directly admitted their crimes, while Smiloff and Gortchimen denied direct participation in the preparation of this terror, but Sgorgol did not deny participating in the work under the control of Trotsky. (19th TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Zinoviev, Kamenev, and twelve other reactionary elements, former members of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, were accused of conspiring to use terrorist means to subvert the country and endanger the lives of leaders of the current government, especially the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Stalin, under the instigation of the anti-cadre leader Trotsky. The case opened yesterday and did not adjourn until night. The trial was held overnight. The court was set up in the trade union office. The military police were heavily guarded, and those who entered the court to listen were also strictly investigated in advance to show seriousness. At the opening of the trial yesterday, prosecutor Lingor demanded that the defendants be sentenced to death and declared that the economic source of these terrorists was the financing of certain employees of the National Bank. When carrying out terrorist acts, they were divided into two groups. If the first group failed, the second group would take over. The famous political commentator and editor-in-chief of Pravda, Radek, the executive committee member of the Third International, Pyatakov, the former ambassador to Britain, Sokolnikov, and the important member of the Communist Party, Selebryanov, were all listed in the second group. The current People's Commissar for Transportation, Belaev, knew about the original commission of this conspiracy in 1932. At that time, the defendants looked calm, but Avschkeemov criticized the government's major events when answering questions, and was reprimanded by the court and withdrew silently. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The defendant David confessed without reservation to the attempt to assassinate Stalin. The criminals were all related to the murder case of Stalin's adjutant Morov in 1934, and colluded with a part of the German secret reconnaissance to engage in espionage, terrorism, assassination of Stalin and other actions. According to the official news agency, the criminals have all confessed their guilt. When David was questioned, he confessed that in the autumn of 1932, Trotsky asked him to undertake the assassination of Stalin. He had participated in the 7th National Congress of the Communist Party in order to shoot Stalin, but because the seat was too far from the podium, he could not achieve this goal. Another defendant, Walburg, confessed that he entered Russia with a fake passport. The passport was obtained by entrusting a German secret detective clerk in Prague with 100 pounds of British gold. The gold was paid by a certain agency of Trotsky. He met with several important members of the German secret detective department and discussed the first visit to Moscow and the plan to implement terrorist actions. It is heard that this confession has been verified by Walburg's brother, who is also one of the defendants and served as a German secret detective. According to the confession, his brother told him that a certain important member of the German secret detective department said that anyone who participated in terrorist actions in Russia could be protected in Germany. The authorities have investigated and found that a terrorist group was presided over by the defendant Luruy. The terrorist actions of assassinating Stalin and other Soviet Russian leaders were organized by Weiz, a member of the German fascist party and representative of Himmler, the director of the German secret detective department. According to the TASS news agency, the confessions obtained after the opening of the trial today have proved that Trotsky and his sons are guilty of personally directing and organizing terrorist actions that are detrimental to the Soviet Russian leaders. If the Trotsky and his sons can be immediately arrested, they will be tried and convicted by the military court or the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The defendant Zinoviev confessed everything without any reservation. According to the confession, the most active and strongest advocate of terrorist actions in the case was Smirnov. Zinoviev replied to the questioning that part of his plan was to feign loyalty to the Communist Party while secretly engaging in various terrorist activities. The defendant Lingold confessed that they premeditated to make Noviev and Kamenev visit the Communist Party four times to feign hospitality and gain Stalin's trust. After gaining power, they would exterminate all the terrorist members who could expose their crimes in the positions where they were. Another defendant confessed that a man named Bogdan was ordered to assassinate Stalin. Because Bogdan was slow to carry out this mission, the leader of the party told him that if he could not kill Stalin, he should commit suicide. So Bogdan had no choice but to commit suicide.</p>
<p>When the defendants confessed their crimes, they often quarreled with each other. Kamenev had gray hair and looked dignified. During the interrogation, he admitted that he personally hated Stalin. The fact that the defendants repeatedly tried to carry out terrorist actions was due to Stalin's seizure of power. As for his hatred of Stalin, it was because Stalin's socialist policies were successful. Jia also mentioned a conspiracy that involved many people, including the official spokesman for Soviet Russian foreign affairs, Lighteck, and the journalist of Izvestia, the organ of the All-Russian Executive Committee, Bukharin. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian authorities arrested another thirteen people today for the Trotsky counter-revolution case, including one woman. They may be tried separately. It will take a week to complete the trial of the sixteen people who are on trial. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Oslo, Norway The anti-cadre leader Trotsky declared to reporters that in a few years, he will turn the Moscow authorities into defendants in order to redress this prison. The reactionary case woven by Moscow this time is purely the result of personal revenge. He will disclose various documents to prove that he is innocent. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>

It has now been extinguished, with losses of 25,000 yuan. Seven fires have broken out in Bethlehem Company's shipyards since January. In 1934, when the Quincy was under construction, there was also a fire, with losses of 150,000 yuan. Every time a fire breaks out, there are rumors of espionage plots, but no evidence has been found.

<h3>Wang Zhengting Will Be Appointed as Ambassador to the United States, the US Has Not Expressed Anything</h3>
<p>(Washington) Personnel at the Chinese Embassy here declined to comment on the news from Nanjing that former Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Zhengting would succeed Shi Zhaoji as the Chinese Ambassador to the United States. They only knew that Shi had requested leave from his government and was willing to resign and return to his country. Ambassador Shi is currently vacationing in Schülvenez, and State Department officials are also keeping silent about this news. However, it is heard that Dr. Wang has a very good reputation in Washington and has many friends. He recently traveled to the United States in the capacity of director of the Far East region of the International Rotary Club and is now in Germany. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Military Court Continues to Hear Anti-Government Case, Defendants Confess to Plotting to Harm Stalin, Trotsky Makes Grand Statements Abroad</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The military judge of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union publicly tried 14 Soviet counter-revolutionaries, including Zinoviev, today. The chairman was Oulirik, and the Soviet state lawyer Vishexinsky served as the prosecutor. All defendants refused lawyer defense. The chairman then declared that the defendants had the right to accept lawyer defense. According to the indictment, all defendants directly admitted their crimes, while Smiloff and Gortchimen denied direct participation in the preparation of this terror, but Sgorgol did not deny participating in the work under the control of Trotsky. (19th TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Zinoviev, Kamenev, and twelve other reactionary elements, former members of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, were accused of conspiring to use terrorist means to subvert the country and endanger the lives of leaders of the current government, especially the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Stalin, under the instigation of the anti-cadre leader Trotsky. The case opened yesterday and did not adjourn until night. The trial was held overnight. The court was set up in the trade union office. The military police were heavily guarded, and those who entered the court to listen were also strictly investigated in advance to show seriousness. At the opening of the trial yesterday, prosecutor Lingor demanded that the defendants be sentenced to death and declared that the economic source of these terrorists was the financing of certain employees of the National Bank. When carrying out terrorist acts, they were divided into two groups. If the first group failed, the second group would take over. The famous political commentator and editor-in-chief of Pravda, Radek, the executive committee member of the Third International, Pyatakov, the former ambassador to Britain, Sokolnikov, and the important member of the Communist Party, Selebryanov, were all listed in the second group. The current People's Commissar for Transportation, Belaev, knew about the original commission of this conspiracy in 1932. At that time, the defendants looked calm, but Avschkeemov criticized the government's major events when answering questions, and was reprimanded by the court and withdrew silently. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The defendant David confessed without reservation to the attempt to assassinate Stalin. The criminals were all related to the murder case of Stalin's adjutant Morov in 1934, and colluded with a part of the German secret reconnaissance to engage in espionage, terrorism, assassination of Stalin and other actions. According to the official news agency, the criminals have all confessed their guilt. When David was questioned, he confessed that in the autumn of 1932, Trotsky asked him to undertake the assassination of Stalin. He had participated in the 7th National Congress of the Communist Party in order to shoot Stalin, but because the seat was too far from the podium, he could not achieve this goal. Another defendant, Walburg, confessed that he entered Russia with a fake passport. The passport was obtained by entrusting a German secret detective clerk in Prague with 100 pounds of British gold. The gold was paid by a certain agency of Trotsky. He met with several important members of the German secret detective department and discussed the first visit to Moscow and the plan to implement terrorist actions. It is heard that this confession has been verified by Walburg's brother, who is also one of the defendants and served as a German secret detective. According to the confession, his brother told him that a certain important member of the German secret detective department said that anyone who participated in terrorist actions in Russia could be protected in Germany. The authorities have investigated and found that a terrorist group was presided over by the defendant Luruy. The terrorist actions of assassinating Stalin and other Soviet Russian leaders were organized by Weiz, a member of the German fascist party and representative of Himmler, the director of the German secret detective department. According to the TASS news agency, the confessions obtained after the opening of the trial today have proved that Trotsky and his sons are guilty of personally directing and organizing terrorist actions that are detrimental to the Soviet Russian leaders. If the Trotsky and his sons can be immediately arrested, they will be tried and convicted by the military court or the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The defendant Zinoviev confessed everything without any reservation. According to the confession, the most active and strongest advocate of terrorist actions in the case was Smirnov. Zinoviev replied to the questioning that part of his plan was to feign loyalty to the Communist Party while secretly engaging in various terrorist activities. The defendant Lingold confessed that they premeditated to make Noviev and Kamenev visit the Communist Party four times to feign hospitality and gain Stalin's trust. After gaining power, they would exterminate all the terrorist members who could expose their crimes in the positions where they were. Another defendant confessed that a man named Bogdan was ordered to assassinate Stalin. Because Bogdan was slow to carry out this mission, the leader of the party told him that if he could not kill Stalin, he should commit suicide. So Bogdan had no choice but to commit suicide.</p>
<p>When the defendants confessed their crimes, they often quarreled with each other. Kamenev had gray hair and looked dignified. During the interrogation, he admitted that he personally hated Stalin. The fact that the defendants repeatedly tried to carry out terrorist actions was due to Stalin's seizure of power. As for his hatred of Stalin, it was because Stalin's socialist policies were successful. Jia also mentioned a conspiracy that involved many people, including the official spokesman for Soviet Russian foreign affairs, Lighteck, and the journalist of Izvestia, the organ of the All-Russian Executive Committee, Bukharin.

<h3>Spanish Warship Searches German Merchant Ship; German Government Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>(Berlin) News that the German ship "Champlain," carrying refugees from Spain en route to Genoa, was detained today seven and a half miles off the coast of Cadiz by a Spanish government cruiser has aroused extreme indignation in Germany. The Spanish warship initially fired three shots at the German ship, forcing it to stop, and then sent sailors from a submarine to board and search the vessel. German officials view this as a serious incident, stating that the Spanish warship's firing upon and stopping the German ship outside its territorial waters violates international law. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency issued a statement today claiming that the German merchant ship "Cameroon" was sailing from the German coast to Genoa, Italy, when it was ordered to detour to Cadiz, Spain, to pick up German expatriates for evacuation. However, seven and a half miles off the Spanish coast, the Spanish government submarine "Pizi VI" and cruiser "Libertad" blocked its path and sent personnel to board and search the ship. Finally, the ship was ordered to change course and sail towards the Mediterranean. News of this incident has greatly shocked political circles here, who consider it a serious matter not to be underestimated. Semi-official sources believe that, according to international law, warships of any country are not allowed to search merchant ships of other countries outside territorial waters (three miles from shore). The search of the "Cameroon" occurred outside Spanish territorial waters, which is a violation of the principle of freedom of the seas. Such an action is absolutely unjustifiable unless the two countries are at war. The German government should demand from the Madrid government (1) a formal apology and (2) compensation for losses. It is known that the Führer Hitler is currently vacationing at his villa in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, and he will personally decide how to handle this matter. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the German merchant ship "Cameroon" being illegally inspected by a Spanish warship outside Spanish territorial waters, the government has instructed its chargé d'affaires in Spain to lodge a strong protest with the Spanish government. Simultaneously, German warships have been ordered to protect German ships outside Spanish territorial waters to prevent further illegal inspections by Spanish warships. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the "Cameroon" incident, semi-official sources have stated that the ship belongs to the "Ullman" shipping company and intended to detour to Cadiz, Spain, en route to Italy, and was not carrying any military supplies. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) London legal circles strongly disagree with the German official claim that the Spanish government cruiser's inspection of the German ship "Champlain" violates international law. International law experts insist that, although the two sides in the Spanish Civil War have not been legally recognized as belligerents, they have been recognized as such in fact. Therefore, both sides have the right to inspect ships of other countries. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Announces Blockade of Territorial Waters; Britain Demands Clear Explanation</h3>
<p>(London) Britain has requested the Spanish government to provide a clear explanation of its intention to declare a blockade. The Spanish government recently issued an order declaring certain areas of Spanish territorial waters blockaded, and subsequently issued a second order, prompting the British authorities to demand a clear definition. As of now, the British government has not recognized the Spanish blockade. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Britain Takes the Lead in Implementing; Franco-Italian Talks Continue</h3>
<p>(London) The Department of Trade today canceled all previously issued export licenses for various weapons, ammunition, and aircraft destined for mainland Spain, Spanish territories, and Spanish Morocco. This is further proof of Britain's strict adherence to neutrality in the Spanish Civil War. The cancellation was announced by order of the Department of Trade, and henceforth the export of all kinds of weapons, ammunition, and aircraft to Spain is completely prohibited, with a detailed list of over two hundred prohibited weapons and ammunition items attached. The last item on the list is "aircraft, whether assembled or unassembled, and aircraft engines," thus including all types of aircraft, both military and civilian, within this ban, regardless of whether they are transported by ship or by their own power. Violators of this ban who continue to sell aircraft to Spain will be severely punished. This stringent measure by Britain is in line with the British government's repeated declarations of upholding the principle of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and is implemented early, before an agreement can be reached by the various countries regarding the French proposal. This action by Britain serves two main purposes: firstly, it reflects a deep fear that the principles of non-intervention, if not implemented soon, will lead to various dangers; secondly, it expresses the hope that the governments of the related countries will reach an agreement quickly. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Department of Trade has issued an order stipulating that, from today onwards, no export licenses will be issued for the transport of any kind of ordnance, bullets, explosives, or commercial or military aircraft to Spain and Spanish territories. According to well-informed sources, when the British and French governments reached an agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, they exchanged notes stating that the agreement would only take effect after the governments of the relevant countries agreed to participate, but did not stipulate that Britain had an obligation to implement an embargo. Therefore, today's ban is a unilateral initiative by the British government in the area of non-intervention policy. Domestically, although Parliament passed a law in 1931 restricting the export of ammunition, it does not apply to other items, and the government has no legal right to restrict the export of aircraft. Therefore, the measures taken by the Department of Trade today are bold and innovative, intended to set an example for Germany and Italy to follow. Furthermore, the French government previously stated that if the Italian government did not provide a satisfactory response to the non-intervention proposal, France would resume freedom of action. If this materializes, the British government seems determined to adopt a strict neutral stance, and the ban issued by the Department of Trade today represents this stance in technical terms. It is said that the non-intervention agreement previously reached between Britain and France will not have mandatory force until it is jointly accepted by the countries concerned. The ban is purely an initiative by the British government, aimed at assisting the efforts of the French government. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) After the Department of Trade issued an order yesterday prohibiting the transport of munitions and aircraft to mainland Spain and its territories, the government, to prevent aviation personnel from falsely reporting their whereabouts and intentionally undermining this law, has decided to authorize the Secretary of State for Air to revoke the pilot's licenses of any aviation personnel who disregard the law. The Department has also decided to warn all pilots throughout the country not to violate the law. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) Representatives of the Labour Party and trade unions visited Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon to discuss the situation in Spain. The nature of the talks has not been disclosed, but the visit may be related to the Labour Party's and Liberal Party's efforts to convene Parliament as soon as possible. Acting Leader of the Opposition, Greenwood, Labour Party Secretary Middleton, and Trade Union Congress Secretary-General Citrine were among the delegation. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Speaking in Crowe today, First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare addressed the Spanish situation, saying, "We are currently strengthening our national defense to prevent a world war. If our plan can be fully implemented on time, our determination will surely succeed." The First Lord of the Admiralty continued that the government has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of Spain, before detailing the evacuation of foreigners from the Spanish war zone by British ships, stating that British ships provide assistance to British and foreign nationals alike, regardless of their background, and have so far transported 3,500 men, women, and children, of whom 2,000 are British. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Crowe, Britain: First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare delivered a political speech here today, explaining the importance of Britain maintaining neutrality in the Spanish Civil War, saying that reckless interference could trigger a European war, and denounced former Labour Party leader Lansbury's proposal that the British government force the Spanish government and rebel forces to cease hostilities, saying that politics had become so corrupt that the two parties were killing each other, replacing voting with guns and bombs, and that such civil wars, assassinations, and violent deaths would inevitably lead to the disintegration of major powers. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Samuel Hoare, the First Lord of the Admiralty, delivered a speech near Croydon Park, sharply attacking the opposition Labour Party and clearly stating that the British government is eager to maintain neutrality in the Spanish Civil War, saying, "Our people all cherish peace, but we oppose the Labour Party. They are nominally leftists, but in reality, they are warmongers, talking about war without considering whether the naval, land, and air forces are sufficient, as if they could fight without them. Such absurdity is evident. If we were to force one of the warring parties in Spain to accept our will, the impact would engulf all European countries, which must be approached with caution." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian reply to the French proposal for neutrality in the Spanish Civil War was delivered today by Foreign Minister Count Ciano to the French Ambassador Jean Blondel. Ciano declined to disclose the contents of the reply, but said that talks on the issue of neutrality would continue. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Propaganda Ministry said that if the revolutionary government organized by General Franco and others in Spain could control the entire country, Italy would naturally recognize it, but that now was not the time to discuss the issue of recognition. According to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini believes that Italian involvement in the current situation in Spain would trigger a European war, and that once the warring countries are exhausted, communism could take the opportunity to rise. Therefore, senior officials, army commanders, and diplomats generally believe that Mussolini will do his best to avoid international disputes, while also acknowledging that Italy has been secretly assisting the rebel forces. Count Ciano dismissed as completely unfounded reports that he was preparing to intervene in Spanish affairs, but said that Italy has a million-strong army, so the general view is that if anything happens, Italy will be able to act immediately. It is reported that a squadron of Italian warships has arrived in the Bay of Gaeta between Naples and Rome, not far from a naval exercise area. Observers believe that this may be related to the current situation in Spain. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government previously made two reservations regarding the French proposal for a non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War: (1) prohibiting all countries from providing financial assistance to the two warring factions in Spain, and (2) prohibiting citizens of all countries from voluntarily joining the warring factions in Spain. Subsequently, France replied with a polite refusal, and Italy's second answer has not yet been submitted. French Ambassador Blondel met with Foreign Minister Count Ciano today to discuss Italy's reservations at length, but no conclusion was reached and the meeting ended. It is reported that Italy considers France's previous answer to be lacking in clarity, and is now waiting for France to provide further clarification. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3>Inspection of the Two Armies' Positions</h3>
<p>Hendaye, France: The Spanish Northern Front is now focused on the area of San Sebastián and Irún. This correspondent traveled this morning to inspect the road between Irún and Barcelona. The two armies' front lines are less than 500 meters apart. The rebel outpost has now advanced to the Aranda farm. The residents there have all fled into French territory. The surrounding mountain peaks are all occupied by rebel troops. When this correspondent arrived at the area, he saw forty supply trucks transporting military supplies to the mountaintop, and an armored vehicle with red and yellow flags transporting troops across the Szterecha bridge. The bridge was previously destroyed by the government forces and has now been rebuilt by the rebel forces. The government forces' outpost is in the Dapença area. Sentries are either hidden behind sandbags or stationed atop high mountains, watching the rebel forces. A section of the road that crosses between the two armies has been destroyed by government forces and has many landmines planted, but there has been no fighting along the entire front line until noon. Both sides are optimistic about the future. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Barcelona: Implementing a New Economic System</h3>
<p>Barcelona: The Economic Committee of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, composed of representatives from various parties in the Popular Front and representatives from various trade unions, has resolved to implement a new economic system immediately. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The quantity of production in the province should be balanced with the needs of consumers. All non-essential factories should immediately cease production.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign trade should be exclusively operated by the provincial government so that the new economic system is not affected by external shocks.</p>
<p>(3) The land in the province should be divided into large, medium, and small categories. Large-sized land should be collectivized immediately and cultivated by the trade unions of the province. The crops produced from medium and small-sized land should be sold and purchased by the trade unions.</p>
<p>(4) Various large-scale industries, public utilities, and public transport should also be collectivized.</p>
<p>(5) Financial affairs should be managed by the working class.</p>
<p>(6) Industries that continue to be managed by private individuals should be managed by trade unions.</p>
<p>(7) Farms and factories should increase the price of agricultural products in order to absorb a large number of unemployed workers, and urban workers should be encouraged to return to agriculture as much as possible.</p>
<p>(8) Eliminate exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and replace them with a simple tax system. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Civil War Claims 50,000 Lives; Leaving Behind 70,000 Orphans and Widows</h3>

In the major battles at the end of last week, 2,000 people died in Badajoz, 1,000 in Manresa, and more than 1,000 in the province of Teruel. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<h3>Czech President's Speech: Not Worried About German Aggression; Czech-German Relations Move With France and Germany</h3>
<p>Prague, Czech Republic: President Beneš recently traveled to North Bohemia and stayed overnight in Zeleny Brod yesterday, where he delivered a speech, saying, "Some say that Germany will inevitably invade our country in the future. In my opinion, this is absurd. It should be known that our country has a population of fifteen million, is located in the center of Europe, and if any country wants to endanger our existence, it will inevitably cause a European crisis, which no one wants to see. Moreover, our country's policy towards European countries will never hinder the relationship between Czechoslovakia and Germany, preventing them from obtaining a concrete resolution. The five countries that signed the Locarno Pact will hold a meeting this fall. All obstacles that hinder European peace will be cleared at that time." President Beneš then reiterated that Czechoslovakia's foreign policy moves with four factors in Europe: the attitudes of Poland, Italy, Germany, and Soviet Russia. "There are many absurd and untrue reports about the relationship between Czechoslovakia and Soviet Russia. These are all fabrications and have ulterior motives. In short, the most important issue at present is the relationship between Czechoslovakia and Germany, and the mutual understanding between France and Germany is also related to the survival of Czechoslovakia. If these two countries can reach a compromise, then some of the difficult problems between Germany and Czechoslovakia will be automatically eliminated." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>US Republican Party Continues to Attack New Deal; Third Party Speculates on Election Prospects</h3>

As for the agricultural control policy, it has caused countless livestock to starve to death in the fields and prevented the import of wheat flour from abroad.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Election Headquarters explained two points of doubt: (1) If the head of a joint guarantee is also an official of a professional organization, they should participate in the professional election; (2) The nomination of candidates should be carried out at the district offices in each county.

<p>(Changsha) Central Commissioners for the National Election, Zhang Jianbai and others, arrived in Hunan on the 20th. (Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Journalists from various newspapers and news agencies in Nanjing jointly declared that there is no legal organization in the Nanjing press, and only two or three provinces across the country have established journalists' organizations. Most major cities have failed to establish them, which is contrary to the provisions of the Election Law. The majority of journalists in the country will not be able to participate in this election. Therefore, more than 220 journalists from various newspapers and news agencies jointly issued a declaration on the 20th, echoing the proposal of the Wuhan Journalists' Association, and elaborating on it in detail, requesting the Central Government and the General Election Headquarters to find a way to remedy the situation, and also requesting colleagues from all over the country to agree with the declaration. The full text of the declaration is as follows: This time, our Party, in accordance with the will of the late Premier, is convening a National Congress, promoting the principles of the Three People's Principles, and permanently establishing the foundation of the nation. Billions of people are encouraged, and the world is delighted. According to the provisions of the table attached to the National Congress Representative Election Law, news reporter organizations elect 11 representatives to contribute their opinions on national affairs as much as possible. This proves the Central Government's emphasis on public opinion. All colleagues are grateful. However, Article 19 of the Election Law stipulates, "The professional organizations and free professional organizations participating in the election are limited to those established in accordance with the law before the promulgation of this law." The development of the news industry in China has been late, and the qualifications of reporters engaged in the news industry still lack legal standards. The complexity of the internal situation is the same as that of those engaged in the news industry. At present, the organizations of journalists in various provinces across the country are less than two or three provinces. Even in major cities, they have not been fully established. Nanjing is the capital of the country, and the news industry has developed rapidly in the past decade. In any aspect, its importance in the domestic news industry cannot be denied. However, as the legal organization mentioned in the Election Law, it is still missing. In this National Congress' election of free professionals, as stipulated in the Election Law, the majority of journalists in the country will not be able to participate in this election. If we allow the journalists' organizations in a few places with rudimentary organizations to monopolize the matter, it will not be enough to represent the will of the national news industry, and it will not be what the journalists in those three or four places want to do. This fact was previously resolved and telegraphed by the Wuhan Journalists' Association, and we are further elaborating on its meaning and appealing after it. The law cannot ignore the facts. If the law is applied to the facts, it will sometimes be exhausted, and we can only change the law to remedy its exhaustion. This is the general rule of relief in the laws of various countries. Now, the situation of the news industry in our country is like this, the qualifications of reporters themselves are confused, and the organizations of journalists are so incomplete. It is extravagant to force the election of representatives. It is neither what the news industry wants to hear, nor is it the original intention of the central government's legislation. We are loyal to the Three People's Principles and deeply support the National Congress. However, we cannot but list the reasons for the difficulties in the election methods, and request the Central Government and the General Election Headquarters to find a way to remedy the situation. All our colleagues, regardless of distance, will express their support for this matter. We jointly appeal, and everyone has a responsibility. We respectfully submit this true statement for your clear judgment. (Central News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>Guizhou Aircraft Defects to Central Government; Zheng Zixiang and Lin Weicheng Leave Guizhou; Four Communications Aircraft Arrive in Guangzhou One After Another</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: There is still little hope for a peaceful resolution to the Guizhou situation. Guizhou's air force generals, fearing the devastation of the region and internal strife, have long been planning to defect from the Guizhou government. Lin Weicheng (a Guangdong native), the commander of the Guizhou Air Force and principal of the aviation school, has repeatedly planned to lead his squadron out of Guizhou, but since the Guangdong squadron defected to the central government, the Guizhou authorities have been strictly guarding against Guizhou air force personnel, and have placed the deputy principal of the Guizhou Aviation School, Zhong Ji, in charge of all aircraft, prohibiting unauthorized piloting. Even when special missions require flying, fuel is restricted to prevent long-distance travel. Lin Weicheng and others have had no opportunity. They once proposed moving the Guizhou squadron to Guixian under the pretext of defending the border, hoping to fly to Guangdong, but recently the airfields in Guixian and Wuzhou have been flooded, making it impossible to fly. The Guizhou authorities have tightened security over military aircraft. Zheng Zixiang, the captain of the third squadron of the Guizhou Air Force, could no longer wait and, taking advantage of an order to scout the border, led his deputy Li Yifei, squad leader Liang Weiru, and pilot Luo Shumin on the afternoon of the 14th, flying three Guizhou communications aircraft, 703, 705, and 706, departing from Liuzhou, detouring near Yaoshan, and turning into the West River. Midway, due to fuel exhaustion, 703 and 705 were forced to land at the Kaiping County airfield in Guangdong. Only aircraft 706, piloted by Zheng, flew to Guangzhou at 7 PM that evening. Chen Qingyun, the commander of the Central Air Force, greeted them at Tianhe Airfield and introduced them to military authorities the next day. They received encouraging words from Chairman Chiang. Zheng and others then issued a public telegram on the 15th announcing their defection from Guizhou to the central government. After this incident, the Guizhou authorities paid closer attention to the movements of Guizhou air force personnel. Lin Weicheng became increasingly uneasy. On the morning of the 15th, he went to Nanning to report on military affairs, accompanied by Ning Mingjie, the captain of the second squadron of the Guizhou Air Force. As they prepared to depart from Liuzhou on a communications aircraft, Guizhou pilots surrounded Lin, saying that two people did not need to go together to report on military affairs. Lin insisted on going, and they were allowed to depart, but the Guizhou people were still uneasy and sent three aircraft to follow behind, until near Nanning, when they turned back. After arriving in Nanning, Lin met with Li Bai and reported on the air force incident (referring to Zheng Zixiang's escape with three aircraft to Guangdong). For precautionary measures, Li Bai agreed to organize an aviation committee in Nanning, tasked with planning air force combat strategies, but in reality, it was to restrain the pilots. They also planned to transfer Guangdong pilots in Liuzhou to be members. Lin agreed. On the 16th, they requested permission to return to Liuzhou to handle everything. At noon that day, they departed from Nanning. Lin and Ning believed the time had come. After taking off, they turned east and arrived at Tianhe Airfield in Guangzhou at 3 PM, where they met with Chen Qingyun and others and reported on their defection to the central government. It is said that the actual strength of the Guizhou Air Force was initially only 30 aircraft, and recently 40 more were purchased, with a total of over 100 pilots. The Air Force headquarters and airfield hangars are all in Liuzhou, with Guilin, Wuzhou, and Nanning as important stations. In addition to reconnaissance aircraft, there are over 20 fighter aircraft and over 10 bomber aircraft. Li Bai has spared no effort in expanding the air force and has arranged for strict air defense. After Lin and others defected to the central government, they issued a telegram on the 17th declaring their loyalty to the central government, expressing their attitude. On the 18th, Lin Weicheng, Ning Mingjie, Zheng Zixiang, Li Yifei, Liang Weiru, and Luo Shumin jointly issued three documents: one was a letter of advice to Li Bai, one was a letter to the Guizhou military, and one was a letter to the Guizhou Air Force comrades, advising all Guizhou military personnel to change their ways and support the central government.

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to continuous rainfall for the past month, flash floods, and swollen rivers in various parts of Guangdong Province, river embankments have collapsed one after another, causing floods and affecting hundreds of thousands of people. The situation is tragic. Earlier, the Han River in the Chaozhou area, Chenghai County, breached its embankment by over 100 zhang, followed by the collapse of the Chiding and Changli embankments in Zhaoqing on the West River. In recent days, the Guangxi area has experienced wind and rain for ten consecutive days, with floods in the Fu River and major river basins. Wuzhou water levels rose by several zhang, and the lower reaches of the West River continued to rise. The Fengning embankment in Zhaoqing, Guangdong Province, also collapsed. On the 12th, the Xiangshan and Etang embankments in the sixth district of Gaoyao County also collapsed. In Gaoyao County alone, six embankments have collapsed one after another. All the villages within the embankments have become flooded, and late rice and crops have been completely washed away. Victims, young and old, are exposed to the wind and rain, waiting for food. People in the county have purchased rice, salt, and vegetables to distribute to the disaster areas, but this is only a drop in the bucket and cannot provide universal relief. Telegrams have been sent to various parties requesting prompt allocation of funds for relief. As for Jiaoling County in the upper reaches of the Dong River, since the flash flood on June 7, no embankment has remained intact. There are no less than 19 breaches, large and small, on both the east and west banks, inundating countless houses. On the 3rd of this month, the river rose again, and the newly built embankment was broken again, with 16 breaches. The LanShe, SiXi, Shanzhaoshuxia, and Baiqiaoli embankments in the county have a total breach of over 1,000 zhang, with a water depth of over 10 zhang, inundating over 10,000 shi of rice and several thousand houses. The cry for help can be heard everywhere. Unfortunately for the people of Guangdong, they suffered a hurricane on the 16th of the month, with both wind and rain, and the water level of each river increased further. The loss of rice and crops in various parts of the province is incalculable. Along the West River, the embankments along the river are once again showing signs of danger. It was found that the Jingfu embankment in Zhaoqing once breached on the 17th during a violent storm, but fortunately, the villagers blocked it overnight. After a day and night of effort, the situation was turned around. The Zaogang embankment in Sanshui County, located in the key area of the West River, suddenly had its foundations collapse, but fortunately, officials and people came to the rescue, preventing it from collapsing. As for the embankments in Nanhai in the lower reaches, those that collapsed after the 16th include the Bi'an embankment, with a breach of over 9 zhang, and the Dongcun, Shali, Banggang, and Yinkeng embankments, which collapsed one after another. The Jiangwei base embankment had a breach of 7 zhang, the Bangjiang embankment had a breach of over 6 zhang, and the Yinkeng embankment had a breach of over 4 zhang. Disaster victims have been displaced, and the six embankment managers have urgently telegraphed the government for relief. As for the Die embankment in the fourth district of Nanhai, the breach that occurred on the 17th has been repaired, but the villagers are still guarding it day and night, unable to sleep or eat peacefully. Looking at the embankment breaches in various places in recent days, it is precisely when the new grains are ripening, but now they have been swept away. The future of food for the people of Guangdong Province is worrying. (August 17th)</p>
<h3>Singapore; New Regulations Issued Again for Overseas Chinese Entering the Country; Nothing More Than Limiting the Increase in the Number of Unemployed</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Chaozhou and Meizhou have suffered from natural and man-made disasters in recent years. The people cannot make a living locally. The young and strong leave their hometowns to seek a way out, and the old and weak often die in ditches. Therefore, since this year, the number of people from various counties in Chaozhou and Meizhou who have gone abroad via Shantou has been increasing daily. In July, more than 8,000 people went abroad via Shantou. However, the number of passenger tickets for ships to Singapore and Malaya is restricted by the local government. Old customers who have lived in Singapore and have residence permits are not restricted by the number of passenger tickets because they have fixed jobs. Each person can buy a first-class ticket for 55 yuan. If there is no residence permit, it is difficult to buy one even for 120 yuan after waiting for the allocation of passenger tickets in the hotel. Because the Singapore government only allows 5,000 passengers to enter the country each month, and Shantou only gets 1,000 passenger tickets according to the quota distributed to the four ports of Hong Kong, Haikou, You Tou, and Xiamen. Due to strict restrictions, cases of using sailboats to smuggle, sneaking into the cabin, or forging residence permits to impersonate old passengers have been found repeatedly in Shantou this year. These unfortunate events are rooted in the world's economic downturn, the instability of Chinese society, and the inability of people to maintain their livelihoods. Now, the Singapore government has issued new regulations for overseas Chinese entering the country, which will be implemented from September 1. The measures are as follows: (1) Overseas Chinese entering the country must have a formal passport from their country. If they want to land in Singapore or travel for two weeks, they must submit two photos of themselves and pay a temporary landing tax of 5 Singapore dollars to the local Immigration Bureau to obtain a landing permit. If they are tourists passing through Singapore or temporarily residing, they can claim back the 5-dollar landing fee from the Immigration Department on the day they leave Singapore. (2) Chinese people who come to Singapore in first or second class must have their Chinese passport signed by the British Consulate in Shantou. When they arrive in Singapore, they must submit two photos and a landing tax of 5 Singapore dollars. However, Chinese people who come to Singapore in steerage class and are workers are exempt from passports, but two photos and a landing fee of 5 Singapore dollars should be paid as usual. (3) New overseas Chinese who come to Singapore from other ports must register with the Foreigners Registration Office in the Chinese People's Political Affairs Building within 48 hours. If it is a Sunday, they must register at the Central Police Station. Those who do not register will be in violation of the law and will be sentenced to a fine of 1,000 Singapore dollars or imprisonment for six months. (4) Chinese people who return to their motherland or return to the south in the near future must obtain a passport from the Chinese Consulate General before leaving Singapore, and at the same time request a visa for the passport from the Foreigners Registration Office. The fee is 6 Singapore dollars. They can also apply for a lower decision entry permit to avoid paying a 5-dollar landing fee when they come to the south in the future. Those who travel to and from steerage class do not need a passport or visa procedures, but must have an entry permit.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Long-Distance Telephone; Telephone Lines with Jiangsu, Henan, Jiangxi, and Hubei Are Open; Branch Lines Are Being Expanded</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Anhui Province's long-distance telephone service has been actively constructed and promoted by the Ministry of Communications in recent years, and its business development has been quite rapid. In northern Anhui, Bengbu is the central point, and the telegraph office here is responsible for the overall management. The trunk lines are all open, and the branch lines are still being expanded. The copper lines of the nine-province long-distance telephone are being gradually connected, and the calls are very clear. However, the branch lines are iron lines that combine telegrams and telephone, and the sound waves are slightly inferior. The current flows quickly on copper lines, and the iron lines are slower to conduct electricity. Anhui's long-distance telephone trunk and branch lines are connected to neighboring provinces, such as Anhui-Jiangsu, Anhui-Henan, Anhui-Jiangxi, and Anhui-Hubei, and have been opened gradually. According to the investigation, the places that can be called from Bengbu include Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Luohe, Fengtai, Shuangjianji, Longkangji, Shungengshan, Sixian, Wuhe, Mengcheng, Shou County, Zhengyang, Xiyangji, Guoyang, and Huoqiu in northern Anhui; Wuhu, Dangtu, Anqing, Yinjiahui, and Tunxi in southern Anhui; Linhuai, Mingguang, Chuxian, Wuyi, Fuliji, and Su County in the southern section of Jinpu Road; Tongshan, Nanjing, Wujin, Zhenjiang, Yixing, Wuxi, Wu County, Changshu, and Shanghai in Jiangsu Province; Gushi, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou in Henan Province; Jiujiang, Guling, and Nanchang in Jiangxi Province; and Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang in Hubei Province. The calls have only recently started to be opened, but calls from Bengbu must pass through Gujiahui and use a booster to reach Wuhan. It is rumored that the Bengbu Telephone Bureau is also planning to open calls to major stations along the Huainan Railway, and is negotiating the connection method. Once the contract is finalized, it can be realized. In terms of business, it is divided into ordinary calls, express calls, call notification, and advance notification. The fees vary. The business is particularly prosperous during the active grain market season. Currently, the average daily calls are around 200, and the monthly income is over 1,000 yuan. The Bengbu Bureau has one technical person in charge, one engineer, and nine drivers. In terms of treatment, the salary is increased annually according to the assessment. However, the telephone is still a magneto type, divided into wall-mounted and desk-mounted, which is not the latest type of telephone and still needs to be improved to increase efficiency. Long-distance telephones can now be temporarily connected with local telephones, which is very convenient for general users.</p>
<h3>Kunshan; Preparing to Build Zhenchuan Park</h3>
<p>The An Ting Zhenchuan Academy in the third district of this county was the place where the former sage, Mr. Gui Zhenchuan, taught. The house is spacious, but it has been abandoned due to years of disrepair. The county government, in order to commemorate the former sage, immediately consulted with the authorities of Jiading and Qingpu counties to discuss the plan to transform it into Zhenchuan Park, to provide a place for the public to enjoy. The required reconstruction expenses will be jointly borne by the three counties.</p>
<h3>Local Tobacco Store Owner Arrested for Cheating</h3>
<p>The Hexing Local Tobacco Paste Store in Qian Dun Town, the fourth district of the county, has continuously sold local tobacco to unlicensed private smokers from May last year to August this year. The number is quite large, totaling more than 500 taels. In the first ten days of this month, the store submitted a request to the county to purchase more tobacco. The county government suspected that the reported inventory was still large, so it immediately sent someone to investigate. It was found that there was a deficit due to private sales, and the store owner Wu Xiong was immediately arrested for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi; Robbery Criminal Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>On the evening of June 6th of this year, at about 9:00 PM, the Yuanju silk cocoon trading firm in Fangqian Town, the second district of the county, was robbed of 6,532 yuan in cash by several bandits. Later, the Changshu Public Security Fourth Sub-bureau arrested the main criminal, He Yongding (aka He Yongchao), in Gang Kou Town, the fourth district of the county, and seized 1,103 yuan of the original stolen legal tender from the Si Ming Bank. The Muyi Public Security Bureau sent personnel to Yu to welcome and escort them to Wuxi, and transferred them to the court and then to the Second District Security Command for detention. It was then learned that He was a messenger of the 22nd Regiment of the 36th Division. On June 6th, he and another messenger, Long Tao, took the opportunity to escape and rob the Yuanju silk cocoon trading firm. After obtaining the loot, He married a prostitute named Cao Jinnu in Yu, which led to his arrest and escort to Wuxi. Last month, the 26th Division headquarters sent personnel to the Security Command to welcome and escort He, and also arrested the bandit Long Tao in Nanjing and escorted him to Wuxi. After a thorough interrogation by the Military Law Office, it was determined that he had violated Articles 94, Paragraph 3, and 84 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, and was presented to the Ministry of Military Affairs for approval, and both were sentenced to death. Yesterday (the 20th) at 12:00 noon, the two criminals were brought out, their identities were confirmed, and they were tied up and taken to the Xishan file execution field for execution by firing squad to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Ancient Tree Blooms with Auspicious Flowers</h3>
<p>Near Huizhang Mountain in Nanfangquan, the third district, there is a temple called Dadidian that houses a statue of Zhang Dadi. The temple is spacious, and in the courtyard in front of the temple, there are two ancient yingchunhua trees (also known as Yulan flowers) that are hundreds of years old. For decades, they have never bloomed, and look like dead trees. This year, they were still withered, but at the beginning of this month, the trees suddenly bloomed with auspicious flowers, the yellow ones like gold, the white ones like silver, and the green ones like jade, with colorful colors and a fragrant scent. Nearby residents came to watch in an endless stream, and all praised it as a miracle.</p>
<h3>Smuggled Opium Found in Postal Package</h3>
<p>The county's postal administration recently received a postal package from Shaoyang, Hunan, addressed to Gu Yuantai Leather Goods Store, No. 62 Nancang Dou, Wuxi. It was wrapped in oiled paper and looked suspicious. Before the package was sent to Wuxi, an unknown person inquired at the bureau. After the package was sent to Wuxi, no one claimed it. The bureau director Shen Fengzheng ordered a postman to investigate Nancangmen, but there was no Gu Yuantai Leather Goods Store there. He reported to the inspector Gu of the Wuxi Customs Office, and together with section member Wang Dunyin of the county government, they went to the post office yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to meet with Director Shen and Li Wenbo and others to open the package for inspection. Inside were five leather tubes and six bags of opium. After weighing it, it weighed 3,150 grams. It was taken to the county and reported to Magistrate Long for review.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin; Wuxi-Chengjiang Bus Price Increase</h3>
<p>The Wuxi-Chengjiang Long-Distance Bus Company has recently spent a lot of money repairing bridges. Recently, it applied to the Construction Department to increase the price of a long-distance ticket from Jiangyin to Wuxi by 10 cents per ticket, and the short-distance price will not be increased for the time being. The Construction Department has approved it, and it will be implemented on September 1.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou; New Public Debt Exchange Method</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance issued 60 million in reorganization public debt, and entrusted the Shanghai Commercial Press to print it.

The method of exchanging old coupons has been passed by the provincial government, and the Hangzhou Central, China, Communications, and Zhejiang Local Banks have been entrusted to handle it. The public debt exchanged should be allocated to Daxing first. If the ticket holder needs small tickets, he should pay a printing fee of 1.25 per thousand according to the face value. If there are no China, Communications, or local bank branches or offices in the counties outside the province, they can be sent to the county government for exchange, and the county government will issue temporary receipts, which will be transferred to the provincial bank for exchange of new tickets and issued to the ticket holders in accordance with the prescribed procedures.</p>
<h3>Borrow 400,000 for Warehouse Construction</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department is preparing to build five major agricultural warehouses, and has specially appointed commissioners to investigate the construction and equipment of agricultural warehouses in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. They have returned to the province and are drafting a report to be submitted to the department for reference. The Zhejiang Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee is scheduled to hold its establishment meeting on the 25th. The directors of the major warehouses will be appointed to start preparations for construction, which can be realized in mid-September. The construction cost is 400,000 yuan, which will be borrowed from the Agricultural Bank of China. The draft contract has also been drafted, using 200,000 yuan of reorganized public debt and the major warehouse as collateral. The revolving fund will be lent by the bank up to 3 million without limitation. It can be signed after both parties agree to the amendments.</p>
<h3>Nantong; Suppressing and Arresting Mutinous Soldiers</h3>
<p>The mutinous soldiers of Sijiao killed Captain Shen and District Chief Ling, and then went to sea by boat. They are now wandering on the ocean as bandits, harassing various fields. Zhu Aizhou, the third district chief of the Provincial Maritime Public Security Bureau stationed in Tong, has sent a team to go to sea from Lvsi to suppress and arrest the mutinous soldiers.</p>
<h3>Steps to Improve Cotton Production</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office was established in Nantong. It first started to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and conduct cultivation experiments and breed fine varieties in Tong and Yancheng, the two major cotton-producing areas in northern Jiangsu. This autumn, the flower banks will be implemented for unified management. A cotton industry improvement fee of 20 cents will be collected for each load of cotton, which is expected to collect 260,000 yuan. In addition to the necessary uses for research and experimentation, all the funds will be stored as a deposit for buying improved cotton seeds.</p>
<h3>Cixi, Great Fire in Wayaocun, Cibei</h3>
<p>The residents of Wayaocun, Minghechang, Cibei, all make a living by firing kilns. The fuel for the kilns is piled up near the kilns, totaling hundreds of stacks. On the evening of the 16th, at around 9 o'clock, Xu Ashui, a kiln owner, used a winnowing fan to shovel out furnace ash. The embers in the ash were not extinguished. Due to the strong wind, the embers scattered and flew, immediately igniting the pine needles piled up, which could not be contained. This resulted in a major disaster. Firefighters from nearby rushed to put out the fire. Due to the strong wind, the fire was not extinguished until after 3 o'clock. A total of twenty to thirty small houses, six coffins, and dozens of bundles of pine needles were burned down, with estimated losses of no less than two thousand taels of silver.</p>
<h3>Ningbo, Corruption of Field Tax Collectors</h3>
<p>Chen Qiusui, a field tax collector in Yin County, did not report the grain arrears of landowners to the county for collection. Instead, he arbitrarily charged interest and exploited the public for his own benefit. After being reported by a landowner, the Yin County government arrested him and seized his property as collateral, sealing up his houses and furniture in Jiangshan. The arrears have already been partially paid by the tax collector, who handed in five hundred yuan in cash. He also provided a shop guarantor for six hundred and nine yuan and was temporarily released on bail. However, his family filed a complaint with the court, accusing him of abuse of power and illegal detention. The court sent an official letter to the county government to investigate and report back. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department's Field Tax Supervision Committee, together with the Yin County government, jointly sent an official letter to the Yin County Local Court Procuratorate, attaching the seized account books that recorded the collection of compound interest at a rate of two percent per month from landowners, requesting that it be investigated and dealt with according to the law.</p>

The National Election Office is now working on sorting, compiling, and allocating various forms, registers, and books so as to start the oath-taking process as soon as possible and complete the procedures. Yesterday was the date for supplementary registration and oath-taking for staff and members of various professional groups and freelance professional groups. The office designated the City Chamber of Commerce and two other places to hold the ceremony. Today the Lawyers Association will hold the oath ceremony. The details are as follows:</p>

The meaning of this statement is very clear. The office should have already informed the Newspaper Reporters Association and other groups with this situation.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Statistics Association Announced Yesterday, This Year's National Cotton Production Estimate, Cotton Field Area Over 300 Million Mu, Output Increased About Double Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association released its first estimate report on national cotton production this year at 5:00 PM yesterday. The cotton fields in the twelve major cotton-producing provinces totaled more than 50 million mu, producing more than 16 million dan of ginned cotton, the highest number in the past 20 years, which can be described as a bumper harvest. Compared with last year, the increase in cotton fields and output reached more than double, because all provinces actively promoted cotton planting and the weather was suitable at the time of sowing, so the area of cotton fields increased. The rainfall has been favorable from the time of sowing to the present, and the growth is very good, so cotton production has greatly increased. The new cotton will be on the market successively within two weeks, and the factories are preparing to start work. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Increase in Cotton Fields, Bumper Cotton Harvest</p>
<p>The area of cotton fields in each province is: Hebei Province 9,497,177 mu, an increase of 3,181,207 mu compared to last year; Shandong Province 6,091,514 mu, an increase of 4,290,372 mu; Shanxi Province 2,095,932 mu, an increase of 1,028,030 mu; Henan Province 6,056,634 mu, an increase of 4,261,274 mu; Shaanxi Province 4,235,191 mu, an increase of 578,177 mu; Hubei Province 8,458,705 mu, an increase of 3,890,366 mu; Hunan Province 744,720 mu, an increase of 373,532 mu; Jiangxi Province 235,530 mu, an increase of 35,790 mu; Anhui Province 1,420,000 mu, an increase of 89,547 mu; Jiangsu Province 10,493,486 mu, an increase of 235,933 mu; Zhejiang Province 1,722,087 mu, a decrease of 37,405 mu; Sichuan Province 1,263,080 mu, an increase of 2,088,344 mu, totaling 55,041,066 mu, an increase of 20,015,172 mu compared to last year. The output of ginned cotton is: Hebei Province 2,975,297 dan, an increase of 808,850 dan; Shandong Province 1,848,849 dan, an increase of 1,441,634 dan; Shanxi Province 625,528 dan, an increase of 372,936 dan; Henan Province 1,496,276 dan, an increase of 1,079,498 dan; Shaanxi Province 1,147,775, an increase of 345,722 dan; Hubei Province 3,022,394 dan, an increase of 2,105,210 dan; Hunan Province 294,390 dan, an increase of 152,196 dan; Jiangxi Province 59,705 dan, an increase of 17,224 dan; Anhui Province 545,300 dan, an increase of 337,221 dan; Jiangsu Province 2,434,543 dan, an increase of 456,923 dan; Zhejiang Province 666,057 dan, an increase of 204,121 dan; Sichuan Province 1,263,080 dan, an increase of 814,748 dan, totaling 16,379,194 dan. The average yield per mu is 30 jin, the highest number in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton Consumption is Approximately 10 Million Dan</p>
<p>The new cotton will be on the market successively within two weeks. Although there are a small number of transactions in various places, they are for local yarn factories to purchase for their own use. In two weeks, it will be shipped to Shanghai in batches. As for the market price of cotton, the current price is higher because the inventory of old cotton is not large. After the new cotton is on the market, it will drop slightly, but the difference will not be too large and will not last long. This year's cotton harvest is a good one, and when the new cotton comes on the market, the price will not change too much in one or two months because the yarn factories will compete to purchase it, and the new cotton will be shipped in batches. It is estimated that the national cotton consumption is around 10 million dan. After each factory has purchased enough goods, the remaining cotton will be forced to drop in price due to sluggish sales. The only way out for this surplus cotton is to be exported to Japan. The country used to obtain raw materials for spinning around 20 counts of coarse yarn from India. If China's cotton price is low, it will definitely take the opportunity to purchase from China. In the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation advocated by the Japanese side, the supply of cotton raw materials is also an important item. It is reported that they are currently negotiating investment in North China and have decided to plant cotton. After this becomes a reality next year, they will use economic power to buy up Chinese cotton at low prices.</p>
<p>Closed Yarn Factories Prepare to Start Work</p>
<p>According to reporters' inquiries to the financial sector, there are approximately 2.8 million spindles in yarn factories across the country, of which 700,000 spindles, including those of Japanese and British merchants, are currently shut down. This year, (1) the cotton harvest is good, and the purchase price of raw materials is expected to be slightly reduced; (2) the selling price of yarn and cloth is also high, and the inventory is relatively small; (3) all agricultural products have bumper harvests, and people's purchasing power is expected to increase; (4) since the suppression of the Guangdong incident, the situation has become more stable. Therefore, yarn merchants are preparing to start their machines one after another. Among them, 300,000 spindles that have been shut down have decided to start work, 300,000 spindles are running around negotiating, and the remaining 100,000 spindles cannot start work due to outdated equipment. The financial sector's investment in various factories has accumulated to 100 million yuan over the years. It is estimated that the operating funds required for the 600,000 spindles of yarn machines that are preparing to resume operations this year is 600,000 yuan per 10,000 spindles, which requires 16 million yuan. If the manufacturers have 20-30% of their own funds, the financial sector is also willing to help them start work. According to the current market price of yarn and cotton, if the operation is prudent, each piece of yarn can make a profit of five or six yuan.</p>
<h3>National Election Office Approves Newspaper Reporters Association to Participate in the Election, and Replied According to Article 18 of the Election Law, the Nomination of Candidates is Not Limited to Members of the Association in Each Place</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the City Newspaper Reporters Association has been established for more than four years, but the registration procedures have not yet been completed. In order to maintain the spirit of democracy, it specially petitioned the National Assembly Shanghai City Representative Election Office to be allowed to participate in the election, and sent a letter requesting an explanation of whether the nomination of candidates for freelance professional representatives to the National Assembly is limited to members of the association in each place. The National Assembly Shanghai City Representative Election Office instructed and approved the association to participate in the election, and replied that according to Article 18 of the Representative Election Law, the nomination of candidates is not limited to members of the association in each place. The reporter specially asked the relevant parties to transcribe the original petition of the association and the approval of the Election Office as follows:</p>
<p>Petition for Participation</p>
<p>The original text of the association's petition for approval to participate in the election states: Respectfully, this association was established in accordance with the legal procedures of the Republic of China in 1932. On June 24 of that year, a founding conference was held. Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government and Chen Lengseng from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau were sent to guide the meeting. Fifteen first-term executive committee members, including Ma Chonggan, seven alternate executive committee members, including Qian Hua, nine supervisory committee members, including Yan Duhe, and five alternate supervisory committee members, including Tang Huiping, were elected that day. The executive and supervisory committee members took office on July 1. Zhu Yangwu from the City Party Headquarters and Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government supervised the oath-taking. Subsequently, at the general meetings of members and the inauguration of executive and supervisory committee members, the Party and government agencies sent personnel to guide and supervise the oath-taking. The City Party Headquarters issued Permit No. 137 and a certificate proving the soundness of the organization on March 17, 1933. This association applied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for registration and certification in April 1933, and attached a certificate from the City Party Headquarters proving the soundness of the organization. However, the procedure for filling out the registration form has not been completed, and the registration has not been formally completed. This is the process of the organization and establishment of this association. For the election of representatives to the National Assembly, this association has complied with the order to prepare and report various registers, and the members have taken the civil oath on the 17th of this month. Representative Huang Xianggu, sent by your office, presided over the oath-taking. The organization and establishment of this association has been over four years, the organization is sound, and it has been recognized by the local high-level Party Headquarters. It seems that it is factually in accordance with the provisions of Article 19 of the National Assembly Representative Election Law that it is legally established, but the registration procedures are slightly incomplete. Therefore, we specially state the facts and request that you examine and approve our participation in the election. Respectfully submitted to the National Assembly Shanghai City Representative Election Office, Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association, August 19, 1936.</p>
<p>Request for Explanation</p>

For example, staff from the Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association can also nominate members of newspaper reporters associations in other places as candidates. However, according to a report on the 16th of this month, a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th, the election process of the Freelance Professional Group Representative Election Office, "(1) Notify freelance professional groups in all provinces and cities to quickly prepare registers and send them to the local registration authority for review and announcement, and forward them to the office before August 20; (2) Each freelance professional group should immediately nominate candidates based on the announced roster and forward the results of the ballot opening to this office by the fastest method before August 31," whether the candidates are not limited to members of the association in each place is not clearly stipulated. Some members of this association have questions about this. Therefore, we respectfully request that your office provide an explanation to facilitate the process. Respectfully submitted to the National Assembly Shanghai City Representative Election Office, Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association, August 19, 1936.</p>
<p>Approval to Participate</p>
<p>Instruction No. 9 of the National Assembly Shanghai City Representative Election Office states: A letter has been received, stating that the association has been established for more than four years, the organization is sound, but the registration procedures have not yet been completed, and requesting approval to participate in the election. It is hereby acknowledged that regarding professional elections, this office has now received Instruction No. 42 of the National Assembly Representative Election General Office, which states, "Organizations that have been guided and permitted by the Party Headquarters and are still applying for registration can be regarded as legal organizations." The association's request to be allowed to participate in the election should be approved, and you should comply accordingly. This order, August 20, 1936, Supervisor Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<p>Explanation of Doubts</p>
<p>The original letter from the National Assembly Shanghai City Representative Election Office replying to the inquiry on whether the nomination of candidates is not limited to members of the association in each place states: In reply, we have received your letter regarding whether the nomination of candidates for freelance professional representatives to the National Assembly is not limited to members of the association in each place, and members of this association have questions about this, requesting an explanation to be sent to the office. The Election Law for Representatives to the National Assembly, Article 18, already stipulates that the nomination of candidates by freelance professional groups is not limited to members of the association in each place. This reply is for your information. Respectfully to the Shanghai Newspaper Reporters Association, National Assembly Shanghai City Representative Election Office, August 20.</p>

<h3>Foreign Banks Settle and Remit, Entrust Bank of China to Act as Agent, Citibank First to Implement, HSBC and Other Banks Will Follow</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, foreign banks in this city have always employed staff from Chinese managers (i.e., trade offices) to handle settlement and remittance for Chinese merchants, banks, and money shops. It is reported that Citibank, a US-owned bank, considering the many inconveniences in practice, started last month to entrust the Bank of China to act as its agent for settlement and remittance. The Bank of China gives interest of 1 li on all deposited funds. Since its implementation, both parties have found it convenient. It is also reported that foreign banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, Australia and China, The British Bank of the Middle East, and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, in view of the convenience of Citibank entrusting a Chinese bank to act as its agent for settlement and remittance, will follow suit. This is a memorable event in financial history.</p>
<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, the compradors of various foreign banks learned of this matter and were panicked, all believing that over a thousand office workers would be in danger of losing their jobs. They elected representatives to petition the Bank of China authorities, requesting that the agency for settlement and remittance be canceled. In order to take into account the livelihoods of over a thousand comprador staff from foreign banks, the bank canceled the agency within days, and will discuss it again after a proper solution is found.</p>

<h3>Central Mint Takes Over National Mint Bureaus, Investigates Machine and Housing Conditions, Sends Personnel to Draft Reorganization Measures</h3>
<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, in order to unify minting rights, the Ministry of Finance specially ordered the custodians of the old mint bureaus in Hangzhou, Wuchang, Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Tianjin, and Beiping to hand over all the mint bureaus to the Central Mint for management, so that they can measure the situation in various places and allocate the powers of the various mint bureaus across the country, unify minting, and complete the new currency policy.</p>
<p>Central Takeover</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the custodians of the mint bureaus in various places have reported on the machines, houses, detailed internal conditions, past achievements, and annual expenses, respectively. The Central Mint has also sent experts to various mint bureaus to investigate. The statistics have now been completed, and the reorganization and application methods can be drafted in the shortest time and reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>Future Measures</p>
<p>A reporter from Hua Dong News Agency inquired with relevant parties yesterday morning and learned that the Central Mint will start reorganization after investigation and clarification. In the future, the existing machinery of each mint bureau will be the initial stage of reorganization. If the machinery of Mint A matches that of Mint B, it will be moved for use. According to the financial sector, this type of machinery is also suitable for the minting of new subsidiary coins, and some can even print legal tender.</p>
<h3>County Land Administration Bureau Explains Land Value Tax Collection Method, Classifies Land and Estimates Value, No Additional Taxes Besides Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai County is implementing land value tax for the first time this year, it is an unprecedented event. A few days ago, Qin Xitian, the chairman of the County Local Association, sent a letter to the County Land Administration Bureau asking about two points of doubt: (1) Besides the 1% land value tax, will the original surcharge tax still be levied? (2) After the tidal fields in the reed marshes are upgraded to arable land, will they also be assessed at an average land value of 100 yuan per mu, the same as rural land? Director Jin Yanzhe replied with a letter yesterday explaining the truth. The original letter is recorded below: In reply, I have received your letter. The land value tax in this county is collected in two installments at a tax rate of 1% of the assessed land value. All surcharges have been abolished. The average land value of rural land in this county is just over 100 yuan per mu. The land value tax has been reduced by 1 jiao and 5 fen compared to the old field tax. The implementation of the land value tax can average the burden on the people, which is not an exaggeration. It is not true that additional taxes still need to be levied besides the 1% land value tax. This time, the land value of rural land in this county is divided into four types of land value areas: residential land, farmland and miscellaneous land, open ground, state-owned gardens, graveyard wasteland, pond rivers, and reed marshes. The standard land values are: residential land, the highest price is 130 yuan per mu, and the lowest price is 115 yuan; farmland and miscellaneous land, the highest price is 109 yuan, and the lowest price is 96 yuan; graveyard wasteland, the highest price is 74 yuan, and the lowest price is 65 yuan; pond rivers, the highest price is 32 yuan, and the lowest price is 25 yuan. If the land has special circumstances, it will be estimated separately and listed as a special land value, and will be notified separately in accordance with the law. Although the coastal reed marshes have been upgraded to arable land, the tax will be lightened due to the lower land value, and there will be no increase in the burden. The chairman reported at the 15th Land Reorganization Discussion Committee that the estimated land value of rural land is 100 yuan per mu, which refers to the average, and it does not mean that the land value of reed marshes and tidal flats is taxed at 100 yuan per mu. The main purpose of implementing the land value tax is to levy taxes based on value, equalize the burden on the people, eliminate the accumulated malpractices of the field tax, increase government revenue, and promote the development of local undertakings. It is the most reasonable and fair tax system in modern times. The Premier spoke in detail in his testament. Land surveys and land registration in this county have been completed one after another. We have been ordered by the province to promote it first. Under the command of the Premier's land policy, Yanzhe will do his best to actively implement it, so as to see its completion as soon as possible. However, it is an unprecedented event, and we hope that local talents will help, so that it can be promoted without hindrance. I am honored to have been inquired about and truthfully reported the facts. I hope you will take notice.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Borrows from Three Banks, Already Disbursed 3 Million Yuan, Two More Installments at the End of August and Mid-September, Rumors of Increased Borrowing are Untrue</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to reorganize its finances, borrowed 6 million yuan from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, with the province's tax revenue as collateral. The contract was signed in Guangdong at the end of July. The Guangdong branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are directly disbursing the funds. As for the Central Bank, because its Guangzhou branch is still under preparation, it has entrusted the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China to handle the matter. The contract stipulates that the funds will be disbursed in four installments, each installment being 1.5 million yuan, with two installments per month. Two installments have already been disbursed at the end of July and on August 15th. The rumor that another 4 million yuan has been borrowed is untrue, as the previous loan has not yet been fully disbursed.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Shandong Zhoucun Serge and Tweed Dumped in Shanghai, Suspected of Being Smuggled Goods, The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Inquired with the Local Chamber of Commerce for Details, The National Goods Year Meeting Asks the Anti-Smuggling Association to Prevent It</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the number of Minghua Serge and Zhongshan Tweed from Zhoucun, Shandong, has recently increased sharply in the local silk market, with about five or six thousand bolts being transported to Shanghai every day, endlessly. The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Year Movement, considering that these rayon fabrics are being dumped at low prices, which greatly hinders the local Chinese weaving factories, has separately sent letters to silk merchants, requesting them to refuse to purchase them, and also requested the anti-smuggling associations to prevent it, in order to maintain the domestic silk industry. The original letters are transcribed as follows: (1) Gentlemen, it has been found that Minghua Serge and Zhongshan Tweed from Zhoucun, Shandong, have recently been dumped at low prices in the market, which is very rampant. As many as five or six thousand bolts are transported to Shanghai by post every day. According to the wholesale price in Shanghai, Zhongshan Tweed costs 3.3 yuan per 2.5 pounds of domestic currency, and Minghua Serge costs 4 yuan per 3 pounds of domestic currency, which is very different from similar products in Shanghai. The raw material cost of Shanghai Tweed per 2.5 pounds already requires 3.6 yuan. As for Shanghai Minghua Serge, not to mention the raw material cost, the tax alone requires 4.2 yuan per 3 pounds of rayon. The huge difference in price is shocking. At a time when tax evasion and smuggling have become a major problem for the people's industry and commerce, the source and cause of this dumping of rayon fabrics are very obvious. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, concerned about the operation of Shanghai factories, has specially sent a letter to the Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the details. This Association deeply feels that if the flow of these dumping goods to Shanghai is not stopped, the Shanghai silk industry will likely collapse, and the outflow of profits will be incalculable. Therefore, this special letter is sent to you, sincerely requesting you to consider the difficulties of the time, refuse to purchase these dumping goods, and maintain the operation of domestic factories. We are very much looking forward to it. (2) Gentlemen, since your Association has led all sectors of society to strictly crack down on smuggling, smuggled goods in this city have gradually decreased. This is indeed a good phenomenon to save industry and commerce and stabilize the market. However, recently, Minghua Serge and Zhongshan Tweed from Zhoucun, Shandong, have increased sharply in Shanghai, reaching as many as five or six thousand bolts per day. Considering the low price, which is unexpected, it is not difficult to judge that it is a disguised form of smuggled goods. Thinking that the difficulties of the time are increasing day by day, and it is difficult for domestic silk factories to maintain, if dumping of smuggled goods is allowed again, the future will be even more unimaginable. In addition to sending letters to various silk merchants to refuse to purchase these dumping goods, we sincerely request your Association to prevent it, in order to maintain the domestic silk industry. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>China Construction Bank Corporation Half-Year Business Report</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the China Construction Bank Corporation two years ago, its foundation has become increasingly solid, and its reputation at home and abroad has gradually improved. Its operating performance in the recent six months has been even more remarkable. It is truly a dawn for the future of economic construction in our country. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency obtained the company's business report for the first half of this year as follows:</p>
<p>Assisting in Promoting Railway Construction</p>
<p>It is one of the important businesses of the company's original policy to assist the government in promoting and constructing important railways across the country. Therefore, at the beginning of its establishment, it immediately started the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge is the main task to complete the road. Therefore, the company raised the construction funds in order to complete the work. Other examples include the purchase of cars and materials for the Longhai Road, the collection of construction funds for the Chengdu-Chongqing Road, and the payment of steamed wood bridges for the Sujia Road, which are either actively in progress or have already been agreed upon. These are all important undertakings of the company at present.</p>
<p>Supporting Transportation and Public Utilities</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, the Ministry of Transportation, in order to reorganize and develop various transportation undertakings across the country, had discussed with the company and other banks to borrow 5 million yuan of national currency, so that various facilities could be decided and held. In addition, the capital telephone is of great importance to increasing the efficiency of government agencies. Therefore, the company also assisted in the expansion of the capital telephone plan of the Ministry of Transportation. In addition, the Jiangxi Provincial Government previously requested the company to raise funds for the construction of the Nanchang Hydropower Plant. The company negotiated with foreign merchants and established a credit purchase loan of 104,000 pounds sterling. The contract has been signed and construction can start in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Net Profit of One Million in the First Half of the Year</p>
<p>In addition, the company has assisted other companies in their operations and planned various enterprises, some of which are in scale or are being designed. The company also provides assistance to the government in terms of short-term financial needs. All of these are deeply gratifying to the shareholders. The final accounts for the first half of the year show that the profit income is 1,438,531.26 yuan, the operating expenses are 94,038.39 yuan, the real estate management expenses are 12,255.98 yuan, and the interest expenses are 11,986.47 yuan. After offsetting the income and expenses, the net profit is 1,230,250.042 yuan.</p>
<h3>Autumn House Tax in the City, The Finance Bureau Sends Staff to Collect, And Abolishes the Self-Payment Method</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau announced that since the city's house tax was changed to allow households with quarterly taxes of more than 10 yuan to pay by themselves within a specified period in the 24th year, residents have often been delayed due to events, or it is inconvenient due to the distance, resulting in penalties for exceeding the deadline, which has increased the extra burden. The Bureau is now planning to reorganize the collection of autumn house tax starting from September 1st of this year for the sake of considering the tax households. The self-payment method will be abolished, and staff will be sent to collect the tax on a quarterly basis regardless of the amount of the tax. The tax tickets will be changed to numbered receipts, which will be temporarily filled in by the collectors according to the roster and given to each household to facilitate convenience. In addition to submitting it to the municipal government for approval for trial implementation, it is also announced to the residents in the territory for information.</p>
<h3>Liang Shao Wine Stores Resumed Business Yesterday Morning, Workers Stopped Work, Resumed After Persuasion, Negotiating to Guarantee Workers' Work This Morning</h3>
<p>After the employees of the Shanghai Liang Shao Wine Trade Association members Tongchangfu and Tongheyong wine stores were released on bail, the association announced the resumption of business yesterday morning. However, the wine delivery workers of various wine stores stopped work, demanding guarantees. They agreed to resume work after persuasion and scheduled to negotiate a guarantee method today. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Announcement of Resumption of Business</p>
<p>After the detained employees were released on bail, the association immediately notified the member wine stores by telephone to resume business the night before yesterday, and reissued a notice yesterday saying, Gentlemen, because the inspectors of the inspection office indiscriminately seized wines, detaining the store clerks, so that the whole body could not operate freely. Therefore, a temporary membership meeting was held on the 17th of this month, and it was decided to suspend wholesale business. On the one hand, He Xiangsheng and others were elected as representatives to go to the Consolidated Tax Bureau to petition. As a result, the Tongchangfu store clerk and the Tongheyong wine ship were released on bail. The prerequisite problem has been resolved. In addition to continuing to negotiate by the original representatives, it is necessary to restore wholesale business first to avoid intangible losses. This special notice is given to various treasure banks for reference, to resume business and unload as usual. All other follow-up issues are waiting to be resolved. This announcement.</p>
<p>Workers Stop Work</p>
<p>The 42 Liang Shao wine stores, including Tongxinchang, resumed business yesterday morning and resumed wholesale transactions. The orders from previous customers were also delivered as usual. The wine ships from Jiangbei, which had been stopped at the Xinchang Bridge, were also resumed. However, after Tongxinchang resumed business, at 8 o'clock yesterday morning, a wine delivery team was delivering wine to Nanshi. When they reached the junction of Fangbang Road and the Chinese and French Concession, they were seen by the inspectors of the Shanghai Inspection Office who wanted to detain them. The wine delivery workers retreated into the concession and detoured, so they were spared. Therefore, the wine delivery workers of various wine stores, a total of 160 people, believed that there was no guarantee for their work, so they stopped work to demand guarantees.</p>
<p>Collective Discussion on Guarantee</p>
<p>The wine delivery workers of 42 wine stores, including Tongchangfu, believing that the inspectors of the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau unreasonably arrested people and regarded wine delivery work as a daunting task, and that the workers delivered wine on the orders of the store owner, if there was an alcohol filling incident, the store owner should be responsible, and the wine delivery workers should not be detained. Therefore, at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, a meeting was held at the wine trade association in Maojia Lane, Nanshi, attended by more than 50 workers, chaired by Wang Afang. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, a resolution was made on the spot, demanding guarantees. Before there was a guarantee method, work would be suspended, and Wang Afang and others were appointed to petition the trade association to make demands and provide guarantees.</p>
<p>Persuading to Resume Work</p>
<p>The trade association, because the workers of various wine stores stopped work, so that the wine purchased by various customers was not delivered, specially summoned the workers' representative Wang Afang and others at 3 pm yesterday. Committee member He Xiangsheng persuaded the workers that the trade association was responsible for negotiating with the Jiangnan, Zhejiang and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau on the issue of guaranteeing work. However, it was hoped that the workers would work with peace of mind. The workers of various wine stores accepted the persuasion and resumed wine delivery work at 5 pm.</p>
<p>Negotiating Guarantee</p>
<p>The reporter of Xinsheng News Agency met He Xiangsheng, a member of the trade association, late at night. According to him, various wine stores resumed business uniformly on the morning of the 20th. Regarding the workers' strike and demand for guarantees, they also resumed work that night after persuasion. As for the issue of guaranteeing the work of the Baogong team, it was decided that at 9 am on the 21st, he and Section Chief Jiang of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau and Section Chief Xia of the Shanghai Inspection Office would negotiate, because the workers are third parties and should not be punished in place of the store owner. In addition, the association has submitted the whole process to the Consolidated Tax Bureau, requesting that the inspection personnel who forcibly detain people and goods be punished, and attached two bottles of alcohol and local burnt samples.</p>

<p>The Industry and Commerce News Agency said that Wang Qingmu telegraphed President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan President Jiang Junjian, the railway in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, from Shanghai via Jiaxing and Hangzhou to Shaoxing and Ningbo, was approved by the Qing Dynasty in the late years for Jiangsu and Zhejiang to establish separate companies and promote commercial management. The Jiangsu section became only the section from Shanghai to Fengjing and the section from Qingjiang to Yangzhuang in Jiangbei. The Zhejiang section became only the section from Zhakou in Hangzhou to Gongchen Bridge. The section from Gen to Fengjing, connected to the Jiangsu Railway, and the section from Ningbo to Cao'e River in Shaoxing, have been opened to traffic one after another. In the second year of the Republic of China, the former Ministry of Transportation advocated nationalization, clarified the actual capital used by the two companies, and repaid it in 15 installments. Except for the 14 installments that have been repaid, the last installment has been delayed for many years. Recently, the Ministry of Railways reduced the compensation by half. According to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang commercial railways, it was difficult to operate, and the initial wish was not fulfilled. Only because the government changed its purpose and did not support the commercial road, the two companies let it go to the state in order to understand the intention of the department. It is not right to delay the repayment of the loan, how can it be reduced again? Most of the road construction in our country borrows foreign debts to repay the principal and interest, and there has never been a case of reduction. Why is it different for domestic debts? It is reported that the railway foreign debts have reached more than 100 million yuan, and the repayment of principal and interest costs tens of millions of yuan. Now the last installment of securities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is reduced by half, saving only 800,000 yuan, while losing national credit, causing dissatisfaction among shareholders, and leaving the world ridiculed. The power of weight is very insignificant. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan order the Ministry of Railways to allocate funds to repay it to make up for the regret. In addition, the Zhejiang Road Liquidation Office announced that when the Zhejiang Road was nationalized, the department allocated a reward of 600,000 taels of silver, etc. According to this, the people of Jiangsu have never heard of it before. Now I see the announcement of the Zhejiang Liquidation Office. Jiangsu and Zhejiang are both commercially operated. Since it is called a reward, the affairs of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the same, why does Zhejiang have it and Jiangsu does not? Railway engineering is heavy on bridges. Jiangsu has two huge bridges west of Songjiang, which have been standing for 30 years without any problems. Although the road line in Zhejiang is long, there are no such huge bridge projects from Fengjing to Hangzhou and from Ningbo to Cao'e River. If you really test and verify the results, the Jiangsu Railway should be better than the Zhejiang Railway, but why is the reward not as good? It is proposed that the Executive Yuan order the Ministry of Railways to check the old Ministry of Transportation files. When the Jiangsu and Zhejiang commercial roads were nationalized, there was a reward for Zhejiang and no reward for Jiangsu. What is the reason? Publish it clearly to show the people of the country. The former concerns national credit, and the latter belongs to partial weakness. Qingmu has been repeatedly questioned by shareholders, and forbearance and silence are not allowed by justice. He dares to forget his decay and rashly telegraph. He is anxiously waiting for orders. May you consider.</p>

<h3>Overview of Silk Exports to the United States, Released by the International Trade Bureau</h3>
<p>Our country's raw silk is mostly sold to the United States. Recently, due to the increasing exports of Japanese raw silk to the United States, the situation of Chinese silk in the main sales market is getting worse and worse. The report of the International Trade Bureau, the overview of our country's silk exports to the United States, is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Silk Exports to the United States</p>
<p>Since 1924, Japanese silk has accounted for 81% of the total US raw silk imports. By 1934, it had increased to 98%. Since the US supply of raw silk has been completely monopolized by Japan, Chinese raw silk will inevitably be squeezed out by Japanese silk. However, most of China's raw silk is sold to the United States. Recently, only in 1929, the total amount of Chinese silk exported to the United States was 14,906,166 pounds, worth a total of 61,597,471 US dollars, which was a better situation. Otherwise, whether in quantity or value, it has become increasingly worse. The overview of exports to the United States in the past ten years is as follows: 1926, 10,249,690 pounds; 1927, 10,787,770 pounds; 1928, 10,527,407 pounds; 1929, 14,906,166 pounds; 1930, 9,880,811 pounds; 1931, 9,846,769 pounds; 1932, 2,530,494 pounds; 1933, 3,768,936 pounds; 1934, 1,102,573 pounds; 1934, 3,484,596 pounds. Among them, 1934 was the most declining, and last year has seen a recovery.</p>
<p>US Price Trend</p>
<p>Raw silk is the most expensive raw material in textiles, costing 70 cents to 1.70 US dollars per pound. Since the prevalence of rayon, although some silk fabrics can be replaced by rayon, there are still many fabrics that must use raw silk. The United States is the largest sales market for raw silk and rayon, and its market price fluctuations can also affect the whole world. In the past 15 years, the US silk price has changed greatly. For example, in 1919, it was worth 9.40 US dollars per pound. In 1929, it was reduced to 5.10 US dollars per pound. In 1934, the average price was only 1.30 US dollars per pound. At present, the silk price per pound is still only around 1.67 US dollars. The reason for the low price is mostly due to the fact that many textile industries in the United States have stopped work or reduced work, and the Japanese silk devaluation competition. However, in recent years, Japan has been actively reducing the cost of raw silk and government subsidies to maintain this monopoly trade.</p>
<p>Silk Transportation Method</p>
<p>Since the United States is the country with the most raw silk sales, the transportation method is very important in terms of the amount of freight. According to the research results of the National Textile Industry Alliance of the United States, 99% of the silk imported by the United States from the Far East is transported by land and sea, and only 1% is transported by water through the Panama Canal. In the future trend, the number of people gradually turning to water transportation is increasing year by year. By 1934, 90% was transported by water. The biggest blows suffered by Chinese silk exports are: (1) Fierce competition from Japanese silk; (2) Various weaknesses of Chinese silk itself. To remedy this, attention should be paid to centralizing capital and expanding production immediately; (3) Product standardization and quota standardization; (4) Reducing tariffs and encouraging exports. The above four points are the prerequisites for saving the silk industry. I hope that our government and industry and commerce will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Industrial Syndicate Organized by Various Banks</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks, in order to thoroughly relieve industry and commerce, responded to the suggestions of various industries and planned to organize an industrial loan syndicate. After exchanging opinions among the banks, they believed that industrial loans were one of the businesses of each bank. Moreover, each bank had already handled them separately, such as mortgage loans for factories and goods. It seemed unnecessary to organize an industrial syndicate again. Therefore, the matter of planning to organize an industrial syndicate has already been suspended.</p>
<h3>Request for Appropriation of Subsidies for Participation in the Texas Exposition: Wang Xiaolai and Others Telegraph the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various domestic goods organizations a few days ago to discuss matters related to the participation of the Chinese Pavilion in the Texas Centennial Exposition in the United States. Regarding the funding item, it was resolved to request a subsidy from the Ministry of Industry. Since the exposition has already opened, but the funds have not yet been secured, the chamber's chairman, Wang Xiaolai, and the chairman of the Federation of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, each sent a special telegram, urging the Ministry of Industry to allocate the funds as requested. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>To Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Guling: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request for a subsidy to participate in the Texas Centennial Exposition in the United States. I sincerely implore you to grant an appropriate subsidy. Lin Kanghou bows.</p>
<p>To Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Gushu: The Texas Centennial Exposition in the United States has been open for a long time. Domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai are eager to select products to participate, fearing it will be too late. Regarding the required expenses, I sincerely implore you to quickly approve and allocate funds for subsidies. I am filled with anticipation. Wang Xiaolai bows and deletes.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News of Labor Strikes in Three British and American Factories</h3>
<p>According to the Dagon News Agency, more than 2,600 male and female workers at the Third Factory of the British American Tobacco Company at 674 Huade Road and Tanpeng Road in Pudong went on strike on the morning of the day before yesterday in protest against the factory's suspension of female worker A Wu in the cigarette rolling department, and against the harsh treatment of workers by the Chinese manager Wei Ziqian, who did not allow them to take leave. Yesterday morning, male workers from various departments of the factory sent representatives Yao Ligen, Chen Jintang, Yang Xiangsheng, Yang Antai, female worker representative Zhu Acui, and employee representative Jiang Zhongheng, a total of six people, to meet with the foreign manager Huisi Xialuke at the factory to discuss solutions. Huisi replied that he would explain the reasons for the dismissal of female worker A Wu, and regarding the issue of Chinese manager Wei Ziqian not allowing workers to take leave, in the future, workers in various departments who need to take long leave for weddings, funerals, and celebrations will be allowed to apply for leave from the Western foremen in each department. If the Western foremen create difficulties, they should report to him personally, and leave will be granted. Although the workers expressed satisfaction with Huisi's response, they believed that Chinese manager Wei Ziqian must be dismissed immediately, otherwise, they would not be able to obtain the consent of all the workers, resulting in a stalemate for a long time without a solution. Currently, all the workers have decided to continue the strike and have requested assistance from the Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union. Therefore, the labor strike is still difficult to resolve. All workers went to the factory as usual this morning, but did not work, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Representatives Return to Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon After Attending Lawyers' Association Meeting: Zhang Shijie Talks About Qingdao's Construction</h3>

<h3>Bicycle Manufacturing Industry Association: Request to Change Freight Rates Approved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturing Industry Association previously stated that fellow businesses operated vehicles and vehicle parts, which were transported and sold to other locations. For those transferred by railway, the railway bureau's regulations specified different grades, measured the weight, and used them as the standard for collecting freight. However, rubber tires have always been classified as second-class. As a result, parts such as pedals, brakes, and air pumps that have rubber products attached were all charged at the second-class rate by the railway bureau. Moreover, they could not be packed in the same box as third-class goods. Complicated situations often arose during inspections. The association had previously stated its reasons and sent a letter to the railway bureau requesting a change in the grade, changing rubber tires, pedals, brakes, air pumps, and items such as bicycle lights and locks to third-class for charging, in order to facilitate loading and transportation. A letter has now been received from the Vehicle Department of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, which stated, "The case has been approved in accordance with your letter of June 3, regarding charging tree rubber products attached to bicycle parts, etc., at the third-class rate, etc." After reporting to the Ministry of Railways, the goods classification No. 20 order of July 31 stipulated, "Tree rubber tires for bicycles and bicycle lights, etc., are approved to be charged at the third-class rate, etc." Upon receiving this order, we should immediately comply and implement it. In addition to instructing the stations to comply, we are correspondingly replying to inform you, hoping that you will take note of it. The association has already notified fellow businesses to take note of it.</p>
<h3>Child Drowns While Catching Crabs</h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. on the day before yesterday, a group of children were catching crabs by the Huangpu River at the Xinkuan Wharf. Afterwards, they dispersed. A Chinese constable No. 2627 discovered a piece of clothing on the wharf and reported it to the Chief Constable's Office, which telephoned the Water Constable's Office and dispatched constable Qu Hehkui to investigate. Around dusk, when thunder rumbled and lightning flashed, the body of a young boy floated to the surface. The clothing belonged to the deceased. Constable Qu Hehkui immediately took the body to the South Wharf Lifesaving Bureau. After investigation, the constable summoned Bao Jinyou, a Ningbo native residing at 21 and a half Liangyi Lane, Yuezhou Road, to the scene. Bao Jinyou identified the deceased as his son, Bao Akang, who was 16 years old this year. Because his family was poor, he was eating free meals at the home of a relative who ran a canteen on Yong'an Street. Bao Jinyou stated that his son was swept into the river by a wave while catching crabs and drowned. The body was taken to the local court for a coroner's examination yesterday. Coroner Xie and his examining officer arrived at the scene to examine the body and confirmed the cause of death. The family was allowed to collect the body for burial.</p>

<h3>National Products Exhibition in the Second Special District Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Products Promotion Association of this city organized the National Products Exhibition of the First Special District, which held its opening ceremony at 2:00 p.m. yesterday in the lecture hall of the association's building at the intersection of Beidang Road and Haige Road. More than 300 guests from all walks of life and representatives of crab manufacturers attended. After performing the ceremony, Chairman Wang Jinyong first reported on the preparation process and the significance of the National Products Exhibition, stating briefly that the association, in view of the serious national crisis and rampant smuggling, wanted to seek salvation, and it would be difficult to achieve results without earnestly promoting the use of domestic goods. However, smuggled goods are all disguised, taking advantage of the citizens' weakness in being able to distinguish them, and fulfilling their ambition to invade the market and dump goods. Therefore, the association specially invited domestic goods factories to initiate the organization of a national products exhibition to promote the citizens' ability to distinguish and opportunities to use domestic goods. Since the preparations, the factories have actively participated, and the official opening ceremony can be held today. We are honored to have predecessors in the domestic goods industry and guests from all walks of life present. We hope that we will promote the association's mission and work hard to promote it in order to achieve the success of national consolidation and economic construction, and so on. After the chairman's report, Wang Jie'an, a veteran of the domestic goods industry, held silver scissors and performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony amidst the melodious music. Then, Liu Zhongying raised the flag, and they briefly enjoyed refreshments. The ceremony concluded and the meeting adjourned. The exhibition is scheduled to last for three weeks, it is said.</p>

<h3>Car Kills a Pregnant Woman: Driver Sentenced</h3>
<p>A Ningbo woman, Zhang Ma, residing at 79 Tongle Lane, Huasheng Road, suddenly suffered from abdominal pain while pregnant. At 1:00 p.m. on the 17th, her husband, Zhang Junhong, hired a rickshaw driven by Wang Fuchang from Jiangbei, and the two sat together, intending to go to a doctor's office on Nanjing Road and Shilu Road for treatment. They were traveling from east to west on Dongxihua Road and Huaji Road when a No. 16621 truck from Tongchang Motor Transport Company of the South City 16th Wharf, driven by Wang Weiqing from Jiangbei, attempted to pass the rickshaw and accidentally overturned it. Zhang Junhong suffered a head injury, while his wife and the rickshaw driver Wang suffered minor injuries to their hands and feet. Chinese constable Ya Yonglu and Chinese constable No. 61 arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm and helped Zhang Junhong up. He was barely breathing and was sent to Tongren Hospital. He died at 9:35 p.m. that evening despite medical treatment. Ya Yonglu, a detective from the Huishan Police Station, took the body to the Philun Road Mortuary. The court dispatched a prosecutor to the mortuary to examine the body and then handed it over to his wife for burial. The truck driver, Wang Weiqing, was subsequently arrested by Ya Yonglu and detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court. After questioning by Judge Dun Qing, he was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>300 Taels of Opium Seized En Route: Originally Intended for Transport to Another Location by Train: Zhang Huiqin Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a man surnamed Sun went to the Yuan Taichang Opium Shop in Nine Acres, Nanshi, and purchased ten packages of opium, weighing a total of 300 taels, instructing that they be delivered to the North Railway Station at approximately 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday so that they could be transported to another location. The shop owner then instructed Zhang Huiqin, a Huzhou native who specialized in delivery, to place the opium in a suitcase, hire a rickshaw, and deliver it to the North Station to be handed over to Sun. However, when passing the intersection of Xizang Road and Guling Road, they were suddenly stopped by Chinese and Western detectives from the Xinzha Police Station. The detectives ordered Zhang to open the suitcase, but Zhang claimed that he did not have the key and could not open it. A constable then devised a method to open the suitcase and discovered that it was full of opium. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division Eight of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous circumstances and prosecuted according to Article 5 of the Anti-Opium Regulations. When questioned, Zhang Huiqin admitted to transporting opium but claimed that each package only contained seven taels, for a total of 221 taels. Police lawyer Zhang Dayin stated that the opium all had a pagoda seal and was indeed 300 taels. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Tan Xinzhen sentenced Zhang Huiqin to two years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for three years for assisting others in transporting opium. The opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau of Caojiadu Sub-bureau Arrests Fierce Bandit: Foiled Before Robbery Attempt: Dared to Open Fire to Resist Arrest</h3>
<p>The Caojiadu Sub-bureau of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau received a tip-off yesterday that several bandits were plotting to rob a wealthy family in the area. They immediately dispatched detectives to investigate in different directions. Sure enough, at approximately 1:00 p.m., they spotted six suspicious individuals in the Zhoujiaqiao area. They immediately followed them, but the bandits became aware of it and attempted to flee in different directions. Because the number of bandits was greater than the number of detectives, they could not split up. One of the bandit leaders dared to open fire to resist arrest. The detectives then joined forces to capture him on the spot. He was escorted back to the bureau. After questioning, it was learned that the bandit's name was Chen Zhixiang, a Jiangbei native, 31 years old, living in a thatched shed in Zhoujiaqiao. He used to work as a rickshaw puller. Because the bandit suffered a head injury when he resisted arrest, a letter was prepared after the interrogation and sent to the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross for diagnosis and treatment. After the hospital doctor cleaned and bandaged the wound, he was handed back to the escorts to continue the interrogation.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Shantytown Areas Thank the Taxpayers' Association for Assistance</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Public Concession previously sympathized with the requests of shantytown residents in various districts to be exempt from demolition in order to avoid homelessness and provided assistance. Wang Qitai, a representative of the shantytown residents in various districts, specially sent a letter of thanks and submitted the compiled list of Lianhuanbao (joint responsibility system) for reference. The original letter from the representatives is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, we, the shantytown residents of the special district, are deeply grateful to your association for your successful negotiations, which have allowed our impoverished people to live in peace. Our tens of thousands of elderly and young people are all extremely grateful. The issues of shantytown autonomy, the Lianhuanbao system, and the free night schools are all progressing actively. We are now submitting the majority of the Lianhuanbao lists to your association for reference. The remaining shantytown lists that are not yet complete will also be submitted in the near future. Unfortunately, the sweltering heat is receding and autumn is approaching, but the Municipal Council has not yet retracted its order. Therefore, we once again earnestly request your association to continue to strive for a complete solution to settle the shantytown residents and ensure their peace. We await your instructions with utmost anticipation. This to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Opium Addict Commits Suicide in Prison Out of Fear of Punishment: Strangles Himself with a Sweatshirt Twisted into a Long Strip: Discovered and Sent to the Hospital, But Medical Treatment Was Too Late</h3>
<p>Yang Changdang, a native of Anhui, 48 years old, worked as a worker at the Fufeng Qu powder factory on Moganshan Road. He was addicted to opium. On the 17th of this month, he went to Yanzi Nest at No. 405 Macau Road to smoke opium. He was discovered by the Putuo Road Police Station, which obtained a search warrant from the court and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to secretly go to the location and arrest Li Xiaoyun, who ran the opium den, and four customers: Yang Changfu, Sun Bingcheng, and Tang Haizong. The next morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. After interrogation, they were ordered to extend the detention. When the case was reviewed again yesterday morning, Yang and Li were selected to be detained at the police station, while Sun and Tang were allowed to post bail. However, at 12:15 p.m. yesterday, Yang, fearing punishment in the detention center, tore his sweatshirt into pieces, twisted them into a long strip, and hanged himself on the prison door. Chinese constable No. 2357, who was in charge of the prison, discovered it and quickly tried to untie him and administer artificial respiration. However, he was already barely alive and was sent to the police hospital. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The body was taken to the Philun Road Mortuary. At approximately 10:00 a.m., Prosecutor Zhang Zongru from the First Special Court arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. According to Western patrol chief Hail, the police station's detention center had two rooms and a corridor. Recently, due to the hot weather, the prisoners were all sleeping in the corridor. Yang went to the detention room to hang himself after 12:00 p.m., so the other prisoners did not see him. Furthermore, according to Cheng Baoguo, he and the deceased were from the same hometown and were also colleagues. He was willing to collect the body for burial. After Zhang Zongru obtained the statement, he determined that the deceased, Yang Changfu, was male and had died by hanging himself. The body was handed over to Cheng Baoguo, a fellow villager, to collect and bury it after signing a pledge.

<h3>Failure to Solicit Wireless Radio Advertisements Leads to Gang Extortion: Xu Langtian and Others Sentenced to Detention Separately</h3>
<p>The "Urethra Pain Hospital" at No. 892 Edward Road specializes in treating venereal diseases and gonorrhea. The director of the hospital is Yu Luyi, a Mu native. In order to promote his business, he invited comedian He Shuangdai and others to broadcast advertisements on the Asia Sound Radio Station on Beile Road in the French Concession in May of this year. The broadcasts were later discontinued. Xu Langtian, a local comedian who specialized in broadcasting skits, 20 years old, residing at No. 517 Madrid, Gongguan Road, French Concession, went to the Urethra Pain Hospital to solicit the broadcast advertisement, but no deal was made. On the 10th of this month, Yu wanted to invite Xu Langtian to continue negotiations, but he did not have Xu's address. He inquired at the Asia Sound Radio Station, and the station informed Xu Langtian to go to the Urethra Pain Hospital for negotiations. Xu demanded a minimum broadcast fee of 70 yuan per month, but Yu only agreed to 30 yuan, so no deal was made again. Unexpectedly, on the 17th, Xu Langtian invited his companions Hu Zhisheng (who used to perform skits at the Great World) and others to suddenly go to the hospital and accuse Yu of repeatedly joking and causing him significant losses. They demanded compensation of 300 yuan, or at least 100 yuan. After negotiations, it was agreed on 45 yuan as reimbursement for losses, and Yu was forced to write a contract stating that the money would be paid on the 18th. On the 18th, Xu and others went to the Urethra Pain Hospital. Because Yu did not have the money to pay, he requested an extension of one day. Xu threatened that if the payment was delayed by one day, he would add 15 yuan. After Xu left, Yu felt that this situation was close to extortion and hired lawyer Fan Gang to report the situation to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The police station dispatched detective Zhu Yongjun to secretly wait at the Urethra Pain Hospital on the day before yesterday. Sure enough, Xu Langtian and Hu Zhisheng arrived, and when Yu handed over 60 yuan in banknotes, the detectives stepped forward to arrest them and confiscated the stolen money and the written agreement. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin escorted them to Criminal Division Eight of the First Special Court and prosecuted them for extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. He also stated the details of the case. Furthermore, according to Yu Luyi's complaint, the hospital wanted to invite me to broadcast on the radio and directly contacted Zhu Wenhao, the runner at Asia Sound Radio Station, to sign a contract. Later, due to the price disagreement, no deal was made. Yu voluntarily reimbursed me for the loss of 60 yuan. There was no extortion. When questioned, Xu Langtian stated that the hospital wanted to invite me to broadcast on the radio and directly contacted Zhu Wenhao, the runner at Asia Sound Radio Station, to sign a contract. Later, due to the price disagreement, no deal was made. Yu voluntarily reimbursed me for the loss of 60 yuan. There was no extortion. When questioned, Hu Zhisheng said that Xu invited him to go, and he did not know anything else. Judge Tan Xinzhen reviewed the testimony and sentenced Xu Langtian to 14 days of detention for using violence and threats to force others to do something they had no obligation to do. Hu Zhisheng was sentenced to 7 days of detention for the same crime. The stolen 60 yuan was returned.</p>

<h3>Lishi Art Society: Art Exhibition Closing Tomorrow</h3>

Hu Zaobin also needs to go to Guangzhou for business in the coming days. Zhang Xiaolou has gone to Mount Tai and has not yet returned to Shanghai. Therefore, it was decided to close the exhibition on the 22nd. All exhibitors were immediately notified to bring receipts to collect their works on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The society is only open for closing for these two days, today and tomorrow, so yesterday's visitors were even more crowded than before, and there were also particularly many purchases of calligraphy and paintings.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Science Society Seeks Information on Medicinal Herb Cultivation Methods</h3>

<h3>Hongqiao Sanatorium: Additional Assistant Physicians Hired</h3>

<h3>Municipal Government: Appeals Against Public Security Bureau Officer</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Knitwear Industry Association, stated that Song Zhuoru, director of the Ximen Public Security Sub-bureau, arbitrarily detained Li Xiqing, the accountant of the Jincheng Sock Factory. The chamber of commerce forwarded a letter to the municipal government requesting severe punishment. Now, the municipal government's approval reads: "Received. According to the report from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Song Zhuoru, director of the Statistics Section of the First Division of the bureau, only requested investigation and crackdown on this case, and did not order relocation or arrest workers. However, the Ximen Sub-bureau rashly summoned Li Xiqing of the factory and presented him to the bureau. Such handling is inappropriate. In addition to severely reprimanding the bureau officer Lu Shouchu, it should be reported for review." This approval is for information.</p>

<h3>Meihua Bank: Unfavorable Ruling on Ticket Case; Gu Yubo and Others Ordered to Compensate; Provisional Execution Approved</h3>

Details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang presided over the Fourth Civil Division and ruled that Gu Yubo, Zhang Xusheng, Chen Yizai, Bao Ziwen, Li Yichou, and the other five people should bear the responsibility for compensation in full and approved provisional execution.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Traffic Regulations: Implementation Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>After the Public Concession's工部局 modified the traffic regulations, increasing restrictions on automobile parking in order to facilitate traffic, the automobile industry in this city strongly opposed it. Various Western newspapers have also commented on it. In order to show fairness, the 工部局 has agreed to give deep consideration to the points of debate, and because the board of directors is currently on summer vacation and the police chief is also away on vacation, in order to allow the board of directors and other important officials to discuss it, it has been decided to temporarily postpone the implementation date, which was originally scheduled to begin on September 5th. The date of implementation will be announced after the board of directors' vacation ends and considerable results have been considered. It is also reported that the new automobile parking regulations of the Public Concession 工部局 will be implemented soon. The Chinese Automobile Association believes that these regulations have many obstacles and has submitted a written opinion to the director and chief executive of the 工部局 the other day. The chairman of the association also made a personal presentation at that time, and then they discussed it with each other. After the discussion, the 工部局 claimed that it would consider the points raised and respond to the association within a reasonable period. The written opinion is very long, listing the inconveniences of the new regulations, especially for car owners who drive their own cars. Moreover, the automobile tax rate collected by the Shanghai Public Concession is quite high, and the 工部局 should allow automobiles to enjoy the current parking convenience, at least until suitable and free parking spaces are available. The new regulations have not been fully considered, so they should not be implemented immediately. Before making any changes, the current traffic situation must be thoroughly investigated, including parking. The development of automobile traffic will definitely increase day by day, and there is no possibility of reduction. Merely depriving car owners of the parking convenience they have enjoyed for many years cannot be resolved, so the entire vehicle traffic problem must be considered on a broad scale. Therefore, the 工部局's newly formulated parking regulations should be eased and allow various sectors to contribute their opinions, and then discuss a proper solution.</p>
<h3>Lida Company: Details of Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>The case of the accountant of the Lida Radio Company at 395 Jing'an Temple Road being accused of embezzlement has been reported in this newspaper twice. It is now learned that the accountant, Yan Gongyin, is also a shareholder of the company and has been working as the accountant for five years, with a monthly salary of about 150 yuan. He usually works very hard and has been witnessed by his colleagues. When he resigned at the end of last month, he sent two letters to the authorities, describing the situation of the manager, Xi Shiying, embezzling more than 70,000 yuan during the reorganization of the company, and explaining the suffering of his resignation. At the same time, he sent a detailed list of the money and accounts he handled, along with the remaining amount of more than 110 yuan, all returned in full. Based on the above facts, the case of the accountant being accused of embezzling 5,000 yuan is obviously a matter of another background. According to those familiar with the inside story, Yan Gongyin stated when he resigned that the money he transferred was borrowed from the manager, Xi Shiying, personally and could be returned within one or two months, otherwise it would be used to recover the shares under his own name, and the rest would offset the special bonus that manager Xi Shiying had previously owed.</p>

<h3>Ruling on Case Against Those Responsible for Tongyi Trust Company</h3>
<p>The Tongyi Trust Company privately mortgaged or even sold off various government bonds deposited by depositors to other banks. This behavior was only exposed after the company went bankrupt on June 15. The general government bond depositors filed criminal self-accusations against all those responsible for the company, including the directors, supervisors, general managers, and assistant managers, requesting that they be prosecuted according to the crimes of embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust in the criminal law, and the provisions of Article 230 of the Company Law, and filed a civil lawsuit requesting that the defendants be ordered to compensate for the losses. After repeated trials by the First Special District Local Court, except for the company's chairman Huang Suchu (Huang also served as general manager), managing director Liu Fangyuan, Xiong Muqu, director and manager Sun Xin Shen, directors Liu Ren, Wu Jingwen, and Chen Gongqia, seven people whose whereabouts are unknown and cannot be found, the trial was temporarily suspended, pending future arrest and handling. The remaining library manager Liu Zikang has been ordered to be detained, and assistant managers Zhou Longzhan, Jin Weiqin, and Deng Dongming have been ordered to be released on bail. The three directors, Xu Jilong, Zhou Shouliang, and Guo Yushang, and the two supervisors, Jiang Liuzhi and Chuan Zhuyin, were ordered to await public sentencing because they did not hold other positions in the company and the circumstances were lighter. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, the date for sentencing arrived. On the part of the plaintiffs, some were present in person, and some were represented by lawyers. Only Deng Dongming and Liu Zikang, who was in custody, were present as defendants, and the rest were absent. Soon after, Judge Zhong opened the court with the clerk and announced the verdict. Liu Zikang, Zhou Longzhan, Jin Weiqin, and Deng Dongming were found to have jointly and continuously embezzled other people's property, which constituted the crime of embezzlement. Each was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for two years. Liu Zikang was returned to custody. Zhou, Jin, and Deng were released on their original bail during the appeal period. The remaining directors and supervisors were fined separately in accordance with the Company Law. The three directors, Xu Jilong, Zhou Shouliang, and Guo Yushang, jointly reported false information to the shareholders' meeting and were each fined 800 yuan. They jointly violated the Company Law by distributing dividends and were each fined 800 yuan. They should each execute a fine of 1,000 yuan. If they are converted to labor service, the amount calculated per day is determined by the ratio of 1,000 yuan to the number of days in six months. The remaining part is not penalized. Supervisors Jiang Yizhi and Chuan Zhuyin were also found to have reported false information to the shareholders' meeting and were each fined 600 yuan. They jointly violated the Company Law by distributing dividends and were fined 600 yuan. They should each execute a fine of 800 yuan. If they are converted to labor service, the amount calculated per day is determined by the ratio of 800 yuan to the number of days in six months. The remaining part is not guilty. The private lawsuit attached by the plaintiff was transferred to the Civil Division for review.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>Regarding your newspaper's August 17th local news item, "Director Lu of the Shanghai Local Court Streamlines Operations," which stated that since Director Lu took office, he has reorganized important court affairs, and that among the personnel who submitted requests for transfer were civil court judges Sun Jikang, Chen Wukang, He Jingxian, etc., all of whom have been ordered by the Ministry to transfer to other locations. Attributing the transfer of judges to the director's streamlining of court affairs is, according to the facts, not entirely accurate. Upon investigation, before July 1st of this year, the Shanghai Local Court only had "Zheng Shikang" and no one named "Chen Wukang." "Zheng" and "Chen" are homophones, and the characters "Shi" and "Wu" are similar in shape, which may have caused the error. Shikang originally served as the president of the Yuyao County Court in Zhejiang. Last May, he was ordered to transfer to the Shanghai Local Court as a judge. He was diligent in handling cases and strict with himself. In the past year, no cases have been backlog, and he has not been negligent in his duties. Although he dares not boast of merit, he can claim to be blameless. This time, he was ordered by the Ministry to be assigned as a judge of the Fourth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court before Director Lu took office on June 30th (Director Lu took office on July 1st). Therefore, Shikang's transfer has nothing to do with Director Lu's streamlining of court affairs. Your newspaper's report that Director Lu submitted the transfer request is not factual. Such a report is related to personal reputation. Therefore, I am sending this special letter to your newspaper, requesting you to quickly correct it. Sincerely, Zheng Shikang, Judge of the Fourth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, August 18th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industry and Commerce Overview, No. 34)</p>
<p>According to Lianhua Film Company's estimates: In 1933, foreign films operating in China earned an average net profit of 40,000 yuan per film, totaling 16,840,000 yuan. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's inspection statistics for the entire year of 1934, the number and proportion of foreign film imports were as follows:</p>
<p>Country   Number   Percentage</p>
<p>America   309   78</p>
<p>England   8   2</p>
<p>Japan   40   10</p>
<p>Other   40   10</p>
<p>This proves that the influence of foreign films is concentrated in Shanghai, especially American films. However, according to people in the foreign film business, business has declined significantly recently, partly due to increased taxes (estimated at 7 to 8 customs gold units per meter for customs duties, and 20 yuan for inspection fees per 500 meters sent to Beijing for inspection). On the other hand, due to the sluggish market, although theater ticket prices have fallen, they are not as full as before. Therefore, the income from showing a film is often insufficient to cover customs duties and transportation costs. The overall profit is estimated to be reduced by about 50% compared to previous years. (To be continued)</p>
<p>In addition, information about the supply of film, the manufacturing and sales of equipment, and temporary actor agencies are also included below.</p>
<p>Originally, only Kodak and Agfa sold film. Last year, Duepon Company was added. Among them, Agfa has the largest business, about 1 to 2 million yuan per year.</p>
<p>There are ten foreign companies selling equipment: Asian Electric Company, Reiss &amp; Co., Music Electric Company, Loer Company, Peacock Company, Scientific Affairs Company, Western Electric Company, Cinema Supply Corp., jausou &amp; Co., Star &amp; Co., etc. Chinese manufacturers include Shanghai Company, Guangming Factory, Chuantong Company, China Wireless Research Institute, Dian Sheng Company, Shiqing Brothers Company, Hehe Company, Hengsheng Company, and eight others.</p>
<p>There are twelve temporary actor agencies: Shanghai Film Actors' Association, Xin, Hao You Company, Ming Guang, Ming Hua, Jin Hua, Xing Guang, Nan Yang, Jian Guo, Shi Dai Film Company, Hua Lun, Jian Hua, etc.</p>
<p>6. Current Situation of Shanghai's Cinemas</p>
<p>There are currently 34 cinemas in Shanghai. Only Jincheng shows first-run domestic films. Carlton, Guotai, Da Guangming, Lanxin, Nanjing, and Da Shanghai show first-run foreign films. Eleven theaters show second- and third-run domestic films, and sixteen theaters show second- and third-run foreign films. In terms of seating, first-run domestic films have 1,780 seats, first-run foreign films have 9,700 seats, second- and third-run domestic films have 10,636 seats, and second- and third-run foreign films have 15,750 seats. However, due to the limited supply of domestic films, each second- and third-run domestic film cinema still needs to show foreign films for several days each month. Even Jincheng, which shows first-run films, occasionally has this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Currently, first-run foreign film theaters charge 6 jiao per seat, second- and third-run theaters charge 2 jiao per seat; first-run domestic film theaters charge 5 jiao per seat, second- and third-run theaters charge 2 jiao per seat. If we calculate an average of 60% occupancy per show, the total annual ticket revenue for foreign films is 5,812,560 yuan, and the ticket revenue for domestic films is 1,954,800 yuan. But in reality, due to the insufficient supply of domestic films, first-run domestic film cinemas need to show foreign films for an average of six days per month. Based on this calculation, foreign film ticket revenue should increase to 6,203,520 yuan, and domestic film ticket revenue should decrease to 1,563,840 yuan. Domestic films only account for a quarter of foreign films. According to people in the theater industry, foreign films have only about 30% to 40% occupancy in recent years, while domestic films have an average of about 40% to 50% occupancy. Based on this estimate, the business of domestic films and foreign films in Shanghai in recent years is about 3 to 10. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Our National Soccer Team Arrives in Geneva; Friendly Match with Servette Team Last Night</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th: Our World Games soccer team, a group of twenty-one people, arrived here on the evening of the 19th. They are scheduled to play a friendly match with the Servette team of Geneva on the evening of the 20th. (Havas Agency, 20th, Telegram) The 11th Olympic Games, held in Berlin this time, were remarkably successful due to the support of Head of State Hitler. After the closing ceremony, International Olympic Committee Chairman Bailaretou sent a letter to the Head of State to express his gratitude on behalf of the committee. (Havas Agency, Berlin, 20th) Olympic Village administrator Captain Fuchitner committed suicide by shooting himself yesterday. As for the reason for the suicide, although semi-official sources say it was due to overwork and neurasthenia during the Olympic Games, certain Nazi Party members had severely attacked him recently because he was of mixed Jewish descent. The Army authorities then replaced him with Colonel Jiersa as the Olympic Village administrator, while Fustner became the deputy. This move is said to be another reason for the suicide.</p>

<h3>World Games Delegation Accompanying Records (Eighth Letter "Achievements One")</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of Central News Agency, Feng Youzhen</p>
<p>(4)(2) Soccer and Basketball Schedule Arranged</p>
<p>The schedule has already been arranged. The matches for soccer and basketball will be determined by drawing lots. A total of sixteen countries will participate in soccer, using a knockout system. When we arrived in Munich, we received the news that we would face England in the first battle. England is the birthplace of soccer, so everyone was inevitably discouraged when this news came. Originally, only professional teams from England are formidable. The strength of the amateur team is also very mediocre. However, this time, six of the players on the English team were selected from an amateur team participating in the Scottish professional league. (English amateur teams can participate in professional leagues without violating amateur rules.) This amateur team ranked third in the league, so the English team participating in the conference is still very strong. Although our team is the leader of the Far East, I am afraid that we are still vulnerable. However, none of the players were discouraged. They firmly believed that there was not much difference in technical aspects. What they were worried about was the lack of physical strength. Therefore, they practiced long-distance running every day to cultivate endurance, in the hope of achieving some amazing results on the afternoon of August 6th. The overseas Chinese community has also prepared to support us and has reserved 300 tickets. In less than a day, they were sold out. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle on the day of the competition.</p>
<p>A total of twenty countries will participate in the basketball competition. The draw was held on the morning of the 27th. When eighteen countries had already drawn, there were five countries left: Japan, China, Mexico, Belgium, and the Philippines. The first to be drawn was Japan. When the second draw was in a woman's hand, the entire field became tense for a moment because the plastic skin was sealed so tightly that it could not be opened for a while. Everyone was chanting "China", "China". Finally, when it was opened, it was indeed China.</p>
<p>This scene was of great interest to the representatives of various countries and the people of Berlin, especially the fellow countrymen studying in Germany. The players' emotions were also very tense, preparing for a decisive battle on the afternoon of the first day. The basketball competition will use a double-round-robin system. Finally, six teams will be selected to compete for the championship. If we can defeat Japan in the first battle, according to the schedule, the future is very promising, and we will be able to get fourth or fifth place. If we fail, there is still a chance to improve. The entire schedule is too complicated, so it is omitted. Each match is limited to seven players, and it is stipulated that when changing players, the players who are replaced cannot re-enter the field. Therefore, the outcome of the match is very related to the coach's strategy and resourcefulness. Our lineup will not be officially decided until the day before the match.</p>
<p>(4)(3) Preliminary Victory for Basketball Friendly Match Against Peru</p>
<p>In order to explore strength and practice, the basketball team arranged two friendly matches before the start of the conference. Because the strength of European teams is too weak (Germany ranks third in Europe, but was defeated by Japan in a friendly match by 74 to 6), the American teams were scheduled. On the 29th, they played against South American Peru, and on the 31st, they played against the strongest team, the United States.</p>
<p>The friendly match against Peru was held at 3:30 pm on the 29th at the conference basketball court. Players from Japan, the Philippines, and the American basketball coach Tobin watched from the sidelines. There were also forty or fifty Chinese athletes and students who went to visit. The rest of the audience was turned away.</p>
<p>Before the match, everyone was worried about the results of this first battle after arriving in Europe. In the first half, we used our elite lineup to fight. Right forward Mou Zuoyun, center Wang Yuzeng, left forward Wang Hongbin, right guard Li Shaotang, and left guard Wang Nanzhen cooperated closely, which can be described as seamless. Attacking and defending were also very fast. After Mou Zuoyun opened the scoring with a free throw, he assisted Wang Yuzeng to score another goal. Since then, the momentum has grown stronger and stronger. Although the Peruvian team fought bravely, they had no power to fight back. At the end of twenty minutes, our team took a distant lead with 21 to 12.</p>
<p>In the second half, Coach Dong sent the second team to fight, so that everyone had the opportunity to play. In the beginning, we also took the lead all the way, creating a 12 to 6 advantage. But the Peruvian team fought back desperately and scored eight points in a row. In the second half, it was 12 to 14, and our team suffered a small setback. In total, it was 43 to 20, and our team initially gained prestige in Europe.</p>
<p>After the end, the reporter interviewed the American basketball coach Tobin and asked for his comments. Tobin said that the Chinese team has a very good foundation, is well-trained, and its skills can be described as excellent. But according to the Chinese team's style of play, it must have good referees when playing the match. Otherwise, it will definitely suffer a big loss. The reporter recalled the situation of the final with the Philippines at the last Far Eastern Games and admired Tobin's insights and sharp eyes, worthy of being a famous coach. Now, the credit book of our team is recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Seventh Scientific Societies Joint Annual Meeting, Day Three: New Discoveries in Botany and Geography, Chiang Ying Discovers Two New Species of Chinese Apocynaceae, Yang Zhongjian Discovers New Species of Lystrosaurus and Chasmatosaurus</h3>
<p>The Chinese Physiological Society Holds an Exhibition to Welcome the Seven Societies</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) The Joint Annual Meeting of the seven scientific societies—the Chinese Science Society, the Zoological Society, the Botanical Society, the Geographical Society, the Mathematical Society, the Physical Society, and the Chemical Society—held a paper presentation this morning (the 19th) at Peking University, with new discoveries made. In the afternoon, attendees visited the specimen exhibition of the Physiological Society. Details of the various aspects are recorded below.</p>
<p>New Discoveries in Botany</p>
<p>The Botanical Society held a paper presentation at 10:00 AM on the 19th at the Biology Classroom of Peking University. Chiang Ying read a paper on "A New Genus of Apocynaceae in Southeastern China." The new discoveries include the species Chunechites Tsiang and Chunechites Xylinabariopsoides Tsiang. These plants were collected from Zhejiang and Hainan. They are very similar to the genus Xylinabariopsis, but the ovaries of this genus have multiple ovules in each carpel, arranged in four rows, while Xylinabariopsis has only four ovules arranged in two rows. Regarding its nearly rotate corolla, it closely resembles Ehunecbites. The biggest difference is that each corolla lobe of the new genus Chunechites bears a tooth. A notable characteristic of Chunechites is its nearly wheel-shaped or nearly urn-shaped corolla with a very short corolla tube. Each very long and slightly sickle-shaped corolla lobe has small serrations on the edge. Its nectary disc is very short. In the subfamily Echtoideae, it is most similar to the genus Xylinabariopsia. This genus is dedicated to Professor Chen Huanyong, Chairman of the Chinese Botanical Society and Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Plant Research Institute of Zhongshan University.</p>
<p>New Discoveries in Geography</p>
<p>The Geographical Society held a paper presentation at 10:00 AM on the 19th in the [] Department of Peking University. Yang Zhongjian read "New Research on a Chinese Therapsid Fauna," discovering two [] animals. The results of his research are as follows: (1) Lystrosaurus hersi, a new species. Among the repaired specimens, this is the most complete. Besides the complete skull, most of the vertebrae, shoulder girdle, ischium, and almost all of the [] limbs are present. Some of the foot bones are missing. In the world, especially in [] fossils, such complete specimens are very rare. From the characteristics of its skull, such as the upward shift of the nostril position and the enlarged snout, it is known to be indeed a Lystrosaurus. Furthermore, by comparing it with known Lystrosaurus species, especially with the aforementioned Lystrosaurus mui, there are some differences. Therefore, we named it Lystrosaurus hersi, as a new species. (2) Another skeleton. Besides the complete specimen mentioned above, there is also a skeleton without a skull, but it undoubtedly belongs to the Dicynodontidae family. However, the most important parts of this skeleton, such as the [] girdle bone and ischium, are quite different from those of Lystrosaurus hersi. Therefore, I suspect that this skeleton may belong to the Xinjiang dicynodont, because the Xinjiang dicynodont only has a skull, and the new limbs are almost completely missing. The preservation condition and fossil color are also very similar. (3) Chasmatosaurus yuani, a new species. All the Xinjiang fossils mentioned above and previously recorded belong to the so-called Therapsida. Their living conditions were all near ponds, as relatively harmless omnivores. Another ferocious reptile coexisted with these animals at that time, often preying on young dicynodonts and therapsids. There is a so-called Chasmatosaurus in South Africa. Recently, similar animals have also been found in China, and their characteristics are quite similar.</p>
<p>Biological Nature of Protein</p>
<p>The Joint Annual Meeting held a public lecture at 10:00 AM on the 19th in the New Banquet Hall of Peking University. Wu Hsien spoke on the biological properties of protein, stating that we have known that protein is the main component of organisms for almost a hundred years, but chemists still do not fully understand the chemical structure of protein, so biologists cannot thoroughly understand the biological properties of protein. Protein is not only an important component of organisms but also a unique component of organisms. All organisms have protein, and all proteins come from organisms. Therefore, I believe that protein must have special properties, and these special properties are the basis of biological phenomena. From various studies, we know that the size of filterable viruses and bacteriophages is roughly comparable to protein molecules. Their diameters, in units of one millionth of a centimeter, are approximately as follows: (1) Bacteria, 20 to 100; (2) Filterable viruses, 25; (3) Enzymes, pepsin 4.5, sucrase 90; (4) Proteins, milk casein 8.3, egg protein 4.3; (5) Serum protein 7.9, hemoglobin []. Since filterable viruses and bacteriophages are roughly the size of protein molecules, their bodies cannot have many protein molecules, and they cannot have many other things besides protein. Looking at it this way, the difference between protein and organisms must not be far.</p>
<p>Physiological Specimen Exhibition</p>
<p>The Chinese Physiological Society and the private Peiping Union Medical College, to welcome the members of the Seven Scientific Societies Joint Annual Meeting, held a specimen exhibition at the Union Hospital this afternoon (the 19th). More than 300 members attended. The exhibition is described as follows: (1) Anatomy: Specimens of casts of various skeletal remains of the Peking Man, explained by Wei Jiaorui; Materials from embryology and several [], explained by Fu Taien. (2) Biochemistry: Vegetarian mice and [] mice, explained in detail by Wu Hsien. (3) []ology: A type of glass instrument for measuring hydrogen ion concentration (pH), explained by Chen Yuan. (4) Physiology: The sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve centers in the medulla oblongata and their connections, experiments conducted and explained separately by Lin Kesheng, Wang Shijun, Chen Meibo, and Yi Jianlong, using dogs as experimental subjects. The dogs were placed in the device for sympathetic nerve experiments, with a small amount of bleeding from the head, but they did not die. Heat production of muscles, explained by Feng Depi. (5) Glassware manufacturing: Various scientific glassware instruments, explained by Müller. (6) Internal Medicine: A continuous macerator for pregnant women's urine, the device is over ten feet high, storing a lot of pregnant women's urine, obtained from patients by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Union Hospital, exclusively for experimental use, explained by Chuan Swiss, Zhang Enlin. The method for measuring materials that promote estrus, also explained by Chuan. (7) Surgery: Urethral stones, foreign bodies in the respiratory tract, and other specimens, explained by Loukes. Specimens of penile squamous cell carcinoma are also displayed. Chinese men often suffer from this cancer due to phimosis. Circumcision is a preventive measure. (8) Radiology: Machines for manufacturing radium electrons and X-ray instruments, explained by Wang Runquan. (9) Pathology and Parasitology: Many pathological and parasitic specimens are displayed, explained by Hu Zhengxiang and Xu Liangjie. (10) Public Health: A demonstration of statistical machines, explained by Ms. Yuan Yijin et al. (11) Nursing: A demonstration of nursing techniques, practiced by Ms. Shan Xiewen et al. After visiting each department, refreshments were served at Building C, and the meeting adjourned at around 6 PM. (Jin)</p>
<p>Utilizing Chinese Plants</p>
<p>At the same time as the Joint Annual Meeting (4:00 PM), Hu Xiansu gave a public lecture on "How to Fully Utilize the Rich Resources of Chinese Plants" at Yenching's Bei Gong Lou. The main points are as follows: (1) Food: China has a vast territory, and there must still be excellent varieties of cereals that have not been propagated. If large-scale breeding and cross-breeding are carried out, unexpected harvests can be obtained. Yunnan wood beans are perennial plants that can be used to make tofu and other foods, but they cannot be used to extract oil. They should be widely planted. (2) Pasture grass: China has many pasture grasses, especially in the Northwest and Mongolia, with many drought-resistant species suitable for sand control and saline land growth. There must be many. (3) Lawn grass: China's provinces have different climates, and there are many types of lawn grass. Large-scale research should be carried out to facilitate landscape layout. (4) Legumes: This type of plant can increase nitrogen fertilizer in the soil. In addition to alfalfa and milk vetch used in farmland, there are many types that can be used. (5) Honey plants: This type of plant is closely related to beekeeping. A national survey should be conducted for reference by beekeepers. (6) Fruits: Wild fruits such as kiwifruit and raspberries should be cultivated. (7) Nuts: Nut cultivation is not common in China. Torreya, pearl chestnut, and hickory are the most precious, but few people plant them. Methods should be found to cultivate them. (8) Flowers: Chinese flowers are the best in the temperate zone, such as azaleas, primroses, and lilies, which are numerous and beautiful. Unfortunately, most have not been groomed. (9) Landscape trees: China has the most types of trees, especially those with landscape value. Modern cities and roadsides compete to use trees from the home country, which is more than sufficient. (10) Railroad ties: Coniferous trees such as Taiwania, [] pine, and larch are suitable. [] deciduous trees such as [] chestnut, birch, Chinese locust, [] cassia, [] toona, maple, hackberry, birch, [] elm, poplar, etc. China should conduct trials and choose the best ones to use. There is no shortage of materials. (11) Charcoal making: The materials used for charcoal cars are mainly hardwoods such as oak and [] that grow the most. Afforestation of this type of fuel wood is also a program that should be studied by silviculture. The tea oil tree produced in South China has the best branches for making charcoal. Widespread planting of tea oil trees can achieve two goals at once. (12) Paper making: China is rich in paper-making raw materials, such as rice straw, wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, reeds, etc. Coniferous trees with low resin content, such as spruce, fir, bamboo, etc., are suitable for making paper by the sulfite method. Poplar and ailanthus are used for making paper by the soda method. (13) Artificial greening: Sugarcane can be used to make artificial greening. Other wood that can be used for paper making can also be used to make artificial greening. (14) Cellophane: The raw materials for making cellophane are the same as those for making artificial greening. (15) Wood distillation: Broad-leaved trees such as maple, oak, hickory, and birch are suitable. Distillation can yield calcium acetate, wood alcohol, and wood glue. Coniferous trees such as pine with pine branches are suitable. Distillation can yield turpentine, pine oil, and wood glue.</p>
<p>Meetings of Various Societies</p>
<p>(1) Zoological Society: At 11:00 AM, the third annual meeting was held at Tsinghua's Biological Science Building. First, Chairman Hu Jingfu gave the opening speech, followed by Secretary Shou Zhenhuang reporting on the results of the next election of officers. The elected officials are: Chairman Xin Shuzhi, Vice Chairman Wang Jiaji, Secretary Qian Xianwen, Treasurer Lu Yudao, Directors Zhang Chunzhou, Zhu Guangding, Liu Xian, and Lin Kesheng. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>(2) [] Geological Society: The business meeting was held at 10:25 AM. Chairman Hu Jifu reported on the progress of the third session. Then, officials were elected. Due to the small number of attendees, it was decided that the current directors would be responsible for discussing a concrete plan before proceeding. The business meeting adjourned without results.</p>
<p>(3) Chemical Society: At 10:00 AM, the business meeting was held. Chairman Wu Chengluo reported on the past progress of the society. Finally, the election committee reported the election results: Chairman Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Chairman Wu Yunchu, Directors Ma Jie, Dai Anxi, Wu Hsien, and Directors. Zeng Zhaolun was elected chairman, and Han Zukang was added to the committee in his place. Alternate directors: Sa Bentie, Xu Zuohe, Zhang Shu, Zhang Zishang, and Yuan Hanqing. Next election committee members: Zhang Hongguang and Zhang Kezhong. Auditors: Zhang Zigao and Yang Shaozeng.</p>
<p>(4) Mathematical Society: The business meeting was held at 10:00 AM. Chairman Hu Jiaofu reported on the society's affairs. Next, Treasurer Tang Yin reported on the financial situation. Xiong Qinglai reported on the receipts and expenditures.</p>
<p>(5) Physical Society: The business meeting was held at Yanjing University's Physics Building at 2:00 PM. Chairman Ye Qisun elected council members, nominating Wu Youxun, Ding Xielin, Li Shuhua, Qiu Weiyu, He Yushu, and Zhou Peiyuan as replacement council members for the next term. According to the regulations, members can also add candidates, but according to members' opinions, it is not necessary to add any. The society then selected three people from the above six. After a vote by the general assembly, Wu Youxun, Li Shuhua, and Ding Xielin were elected. Next, the chairman was elected. Wu Youxun was usually elected.</p>
<p>Science Society Business Meeting</p>

The day between the end of December and the beginning of January is called the End of Year Day. This decision is a resolution of the League of Nations and is scheduled to be implemented in 1939. We are submitting this motion, hoping that the government will prepare for implementation. After a long discussion, it was decided to first submit it to the remaining general assemblies for detailed discussion, and after it is passed by the General Assembly's Fellowship Meeting on the 20th, request it from the government. 2. Motion to decide on the location of the next annual meeting, resolution: (1) Wuhan; (2) Hangzhou, submitted to the General Assembly for decision. (Jin)</p>

<h3>The Deadly Wound of Youth...</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>A person cannot achieve success in life without a healthy body. Health provides a person with ample strength. It inspires one to strive upwards. It not only stimulates all the organs in our body but is also an invaluable stimulant for our souls.</p>
<p>Everywhere, we see many young people who are half-awake, half-asleep, half-dead, and half-alive, in a state of spiritual decay and physical weakness. They are supposed to be at the peak of their strength, yet they are already in this state of "Alas, how I have declined!" We must investigate this tragic fate.</p>
<p>According to medical experts, the most common cause of youth decline is masturbation. Therefore, treating masturbation is the most important aspect of youth health.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that semen, like blood, is the essence of the body—the source of physical strength and intellectual power, and our precious life force. Young men and women must avoid this evil habit that destroys their future, wastes their energy, and shortens their lives!</p>
<p>Excessive indulgence is a great harm to life, and masturbation is even worse. Because this mechanical stimulation affects the nerves, the first to suffer is the nervous system. The entire nervous system quickly shows signs of exhaustion. As a result, one becomes mentally confused, spiritually lazy, and unable to concentrate. Judgment and memory deteriorate, and self-confidence disappears. Emotions become erratic, prone to sadness and anger, resembling depression. One is in a daze all day, as if lost in a fog. Headaches, insomnia, dreams, nocturnal emissions, palpitations, and tinnitus all appear. One may even experience dizziness, sunken eyes, a sallow complexion, and pale skin, showing signs of illness.</p>
<p>Moreover, those who masturbate often experience reproductive dysfunction due to semen depletion, including incomplete development, nocturnal emissions, and spermatorrhea. This not only harms the mind and body during youth but also greatly affects marital and family happiness.</p>
<p>However, the harm of masturbation does not stop there! Common symptoms include lower back pain, weak legs, fatigue in the limbs, joint pain, hand tremors, vision loss, stomach pain, digestive problems, chest tightness, blood loss, weight loss, and a withered and emaciated body. One's spirit is dimmed, resembling a lifeless wax figure. How tragic! As the body weakens, major ailments such as tuberculosis and heart disease may develop, posing a serious threat to life!</p>
<p>Rescuing from the Crisis Caused by Masturbation</p>
<p>It is common in our society for parents to see their young children thin and weak, assuming it is due to overwork or congenital deficiencies. They do not suspect that their children are seeking a life-threatening path due to uncontrolled desires. Confused and anxious, these parents only focus on tonics, unaware of what is suitable or unsuitable. Without careful consideration, they indiscriminately administer medicines, resulting in no benefit. Wasting money is a minor issue compared to delaying treatment, which can lead to various complications or even be beyond rescue. At this point, failing to treat the root cause means harming their lives. How pitiful!</p>
<p>According to treatment reports from experts in various countries, in addition to general health practices, the following medications should be taken:</p>
<p>For male patients, the fundamental treatment should include taking both 'Memory Neurotic' and 'Well Tonic' simultaneously. This will achieve rapid results and restore health quickly.</p>
<p>'Memory Neurotic' is the essence of nerve nourishment, while 'Well Tonic' is a strong essence to tonify the kidneys. Doctors worldwide consider these two medications to be effective treatments for neurasthenia and sexual dysfunction. These two medications are not only powerful but also have no side effects. Patients can secretly treat themselves at home, which is appropriate and safe.</p>
<p>Female patients experience sexual dysfunction such as irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, and other symptoms of weakness, similar to male patients. The medication needed is only 'Menorrin,' also for internal use. Besides having special efficacy for female weakness, sexual dysfunction, and menstrual irregularities, it is also effective in treating infertility, miscarriage, blood deficiency, and dry blood consumption. Therefore, it is a star among health products for women.</p>
<h3>Telling Friends Suffering from Leukorrhea What They Should Know... Don't Give Gonorrhea to Your Wife!</h3>
<p>— Xiang Bo</p>
<p>When a man has gonorrhea, he knows to abstain from sexual intercourse during the acute phase. However, once the acute symptoms subside, he disregards everything due to sexual urges and engages in intercourse, passing the dangerous seeds (gonococci) to his wife. As a result, the innocent wife suffers unjustly, becoming a carrier of gonorrhea, ready to pass it back to her husband at any time. In this situation, no matter how much the husband tries to cure himself, he cannot hope for a full recovery unless his wife is treated simultaneously. Even if the husband is completely cured, just one act of intercourse can cause a relapse. Therefore, first and foremost, do not give gonorrhea to your wife. Once you have given it to her, treat it together quickly.</p>
<p>Based on clinical experience, the most effective medication for treating leukorrhea is German-made 91 ANTI-GONO-TAB. Because it is a chemically refined product, it can eradicate gonococci lurking in the urethral mucosa without harming the stomach, intestines, or kidneys. Therefore, it is suitable for long-term oral treatment to achieve complete eradication.</p>
<p>'91 ANTI-GONO-TAB' primarily treats acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, as well as uterine inflammation, leucorrhea, and all complications caused by gonorrhea, such as orchitis and oophoritis. It is also effective in these conditions. In addition to treatment, taking a bottle of this medication after visiting a prostitute can also prevent gonorrhea.</p>
<h3>Infantile Indigestion, The Murderer of Children</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>Children usually like to eat and drink well; this is the natural requirement of a period of vigorous development; but attention must be paid to avoid overeating and drinking. If the gastrointestinal tract is obstructed, the supply of food will be hindered, and the nutrition will be poor, so the activity will be slow.</p>
<p>If what is eaten is easily digested by the child's gastrointestinal strength, the resulting digestive products—nutrients—will be absorbed by the intestinal cells, and further by the strength of the intestinal cells and other body cells will be protected into nutrients that are directly effective for the body.</p>
<p>Conversely, when food contains components that the child's gastrointestinal capacity cannot digest, the undigested material will stimulate the intestinal cells and cause more severe intestinal peristalsis than usual, which will lead to diarrhea. Therefore, the food that is eaten cannot complete its work, harming the cells of the stomach and intestines, hindering that physiological function, and finally weakening the body's nutrition and reducing its resistance, which can easily lead to all kinds of diseases.</p>
<p>The symptoms of indigestion are not fixed. The mild cases may only have very mild diarrhea, which ordinary people generally do not pay attention to. The severe cases can be fatal. The common symptoms are diarrhea, green stools and frozen stools, abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal sounds, and inability to sleep. In severe cases, there will be fever, the amount of food will gradually decrease, and the body will gradually become thin and weak and die. For family treatment of indigestion and diarrhea, in addition to paying attention to general food and drink hygiene, taking 'DYSETRIN TAB' is the most effective. This agent has the power to inhibit the activity of putrefactive bacteria in the intestinal tract, and also adsorbs and wraps it and excretes it from the body through the stool, so after the undigested putrefactive material in the intestinal tract is cleared, the diarrhea will naturally stop. At the same time, it can also regulate the function of the stomach and intestines, promote digestion, and increase nutrition, so 'DYSETRIN' has great value in gastrointestinal health care, especially as a special effect for treating infantile food accumulation and diarrhea. It has long been recognized by world-renowned doctors.</p>
<h3>Family Health Consultant</h3>

<h3>What You Need to Know About Asthma Treatment</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Bronchial asthma, also known as asthma or phlegm asthma, and sometimes referred to as panting or dyspnea, is a disease caused by a specific respiratory difficulty resulting from the rigid spasm of the circular muscles of the small bronchioles. The symptoms usually occur suddenly at night, starting with chest tightness and a pale face, leading to a state of distress, profuse sweating, and very difficult breathing. It is labored, prolonged, and accompanied by wheezing, with abdominal muscles tense like a board. The coughed-up phlegm is yellowish-green.</p>
<p>(Treatment) When the disease occurs, administer three tablets of 'Holipin' (for adults), which can immediately stop the asthma and turn danger into safety. For radical cure and prevention of recurrence, continue taking it for one to two months to achieve full recovery. If one usually suffers from chronic bronchitis (i.e., persistent cough), their resistance to disease is certainly very weak, and the tissues are atrophied with declining physiological function, making it more difficult to cure. It is necessary to simultaneously take 'Phith Weal' to invigorate the physiological function of the lungs and strengthen lung power, so that the persistent cough is cured and there is no fear of asthma recurring.</p>
<p>(Diet and Care) Patients should avoid sudden changes in temperature and avoid irritating foods. They should breathe thin air and engage in outdoor exercise regularly. Patients who are physically weak, anemic, or have neurasthenia should also use nourishing tonics, such as 'Memory Neurotic' and 'Conbours's San-Vita-Cell,' to turn weakness into strength.</p>
<h3>Remedies for Insufficient Breast Milk</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhen</p>
<p>Breast milk is truly the best nutrition for infants—especially those under seven or eight months. No matter how much research or effort is put in, nothing can be found that is comparable to breast milk as an infant food.</p>
<p>The incidence of disease in breastfed children is much lower than that in artificially fed children (such as with cow's milk). This is a fact universally recognized by those with a little hygiene knowledge.</p>
<p>Since breastfeeding has such significant benefits, mothers should make their milk secretion vigorous enough to provide food for their babies and avoid difficult problems.</p>
<p>After childbirth, pregnant women have the responsibility of breastfeeding their babies. If there is a lack of milk or none at all after childbirth, it is a great misfortune for the child.</p>
<p>The lack of breast milk is often caused by the weakness of the mother's body, which causes the mammary glands that secrete milk to atrophy. To solve the problem of lack of milk, the first condition is that the mother must fully ingest nutrients herself; especially for the manufacture of milk and the secretion of milk—the mammary glands—to promote its function, vigorous development, in order to achieve the purpose of sufficient milk.</p>
<p>Medicines for treating lack of milk are not common on the market; even if there are one or two, they are not truly effective, but only exaggerated publicity.</p>
<p>Recently, an Italian pharmaceutical factory has newly released 'Mammato.' It is made from the mammary glands of cows and mixed with other nutrients. Its efficacy can develop the breasts—making the function of manufacturing and secreting milk vigorous, while also replenishing the nutrition of the mother's body, so in weak, milk-deficient mothers, after taking 'Mammato,' milk can be seen to gush out in about a week, to feed the child, without fear of lack; and children who eat this kind of breast milk have healthy physical development and increased resistance to various diseases.</p>
<h3>Talking about Dysentery Treatment Experience</h3>
<p>— Dr. Xu Guozhang</p>
<p>Dysentery is a particularly serious disease. It not only threatens human health, but those who suffer from it are numerous. Now, based on my successful experience in treating dysentery, I would like to give a piece of advice to all patients.</p>
<p>Several patients consulted me. They felt dizzy, had severe abdominal pain, lack of appetite, and the stool contained mucus, sometimes with blood. I diagnosed them as having dysentery. Examination of the patient's feces revealed many dysentery amoebae. I told them to take 'Dys-etrin Tab' and also told them to strictly adhere to the dietary regimen. The effect was miraculous. After a few days, the bloody stools stopped, the stools gradually dried up, the diarrhea decreased, and the symptoms such as abdominal pain disappeared. After a while, I re-examined their feces and found that the amoebae had been killed and the intestines had been cured. Moreover, the function of the stomach also returned to normal and the appetite increased, but they were still given a small amount of 'Dysetrin' to complete the work.</p>
<p>According to my clinical experience, 'Dysetrin' is effective and reliable in treating dysentery. Therefore, I am happy to introduce it to my colleagues in the medical profession and to patients.</p>
<h3>The Danger of Lung Patients!</h3>
<p>— Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>The danger of lung patients often lies not in the disease—but in the treatment. Some patients have no medical knowledge. In order to seek quick results, they mistakenly believe in the advice of friends—or the propaganda of advertisements. Without scrutiny, they buy various drugs. Try them one by one. You don't know, the treatment of lung disease needs to rely on the natural and vigorous function of the human body, so that connective tissue proliferates and surrounds the lesions before it can be cured. If you think that drugs can kill tuberculosis, then you will indiscriminately invest in drugs advertised on the air, which will not only be useless for lung disease, but sometimes even harmful, to the point of life-threatening, and delaying the time and wasting money, which is still a small harm. Sometimes some people use this kind of medicine and it is also effective, but because their resistance to lung disease is strong, even if they do not take medicine, they can be cured naturally, not because of the effect of the medicine.</p>
<p>Today's most reliable and well-founded treatment for lung disease is only to assist human power and promote the vigorous function of its natural cure. (That is, to enhance resistance.) There is no other reliable method. Because the lesion has been trapped in our body for a long time, these functions are weakened and resistance is weakened, and the lesion spreads. At this time, if we want to save this crisis, we should base ourselves on the above-mentioned wonderful mechanism of natural cure and add assistance to it. That is appropriate. What is this method? That is organ therapy. Therefore, in recent times, the tuberculosis treatment community has unanimously adopted the internal use of 'Phithweal' to treat tuberculosis patients, supplement their function, and promote their resistance to make it vigorous and achieve recovery. Therefore, 'PHITHWEAL' has been recognized by world doctors as a reliable and reasonable special medicine for treating tuberculosis. That is the reason.</p>
<p>The ingredients and efficacy of 'Phith Weal': This product is extracted from the fresh lungs and spleens of strong and healthy animals. The endocrine hormone—hormone—is mixed to make an oral liquid. Its function can make the weakened lung function—turn weakness into strength—promote its defense power—and make the physiological natural healing function vigorous. If there is tissue loss (that is, the lungs have holes), it can be filled. At the same time, a solid wall of connective tissue is built around the diseased area to harden it. Promote the combination of its scars. Completely wrap the evil tuberculosis bacteria (tubercle bacilli). Lose its activity. In the end, it must be completely eliminated. To the point of recovery. Therefore, patients who take 'Phith Weal' feel refreshed in spirit within a few days. The appetite increases. The phlegm is thin and loose. The cough is reduced. The symptoms of tidal fever and night sweats all disappear. If you continue to take it, and pay attention to general hygiene therapy at the same time, you will definitely win a complete victory in a very short period of time. Re-enter the realm of health.</p>

<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Glutinous Rice Twigs See the Sharpest Price Increase</h3>
<p>Due to the recent accident involving the Yue-produced "Golden Mountain Twigs" on the *Xin Ning* steamer, with over 4,000 cases of goods destined for Shanghai lost, including 400 to 500 cases of glutinous rice twigs, the Shanghai market has suddenly tightened.  The "Zhuang" brand glutinous rice twigs have opened as high as 100 yuan, an increase of over ten yuan. Flat twigs have also risen by one or two yuan. Only the high-grade "Yuan" twigs have remained relatively stable, with little fluctuation. Ordinary "Zhuang" brands, with brisker sales, have also increased by one or two yuan. "Lan Zhu" twigs from Zhangzhou have been scarce lately, leading to an upward trend. Yesterday, over a hundred cases opened, rising by about one yuan.</p>

<h3>Bank Stall, Mobil Oil Settles, Foreign Exchange Remains Steady</h3>

Deferred silver prices in Montreal contracted by 1.1 to 2.2 points. London's raw gold fell by 2 pence.

The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term asking prices of 1 shilling 2.375 and 2.4375 pence for the British pound, and 30.1875 yuan for the US dollar.

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced official rates, with the British pound and the US dollar remaining stable and firm. Later, the silver equalization tax was announced, contracting by half a point. However, due to Mobil Oil's aggressive settlement of near and far-term US dollars, the process became slightly tighter. Afterwards, banks slightly conducted swap transactions. Although Mobil Oil continued to aggressively settle, banks seized the opportunity to stall at high prices, resulting in a flat market at noon. In the afternoon, banks slightly stalled in the near term, and the US dollar was also slightly involved in exchange transactions, remaining stable. The initial Indian silver quote was a small 6.5 anna, which did not move in the second quote, and the overall trend remained stable. At closing, the near-term asking prices were 1 shilling 2.375 and 2.40625 pence for the British pound, and 30.1875 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, both the near and far-term rates for the British pound and the US dollar were stable. Although banks stalled, Mobil Oil strongly settled US dollars. The transaction records for today will be listed below.</p>

<h3>Securities and Public Bonds: The After-Market Suddenly Sees a Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced significant market fluctuations, with rapid rises and falls. It initially fell due to the Guangxi government reorganization, but later rose due to rumors of new developments in finance. Whether the Guangxi situation can be peacefully resolved has little connection with the market, and the Suiyuan incident also temporarily does not dare to have any changes. Therefore, although the market price slightly fell, any slight good news caused a rapid rebound. The trend is still that rises are easier than falls, and the settlement is becoming increasingly tight, so the future may still have squeezes. Yesterday's events saw morning and evening market conditions that were completely opposite. In the morning opening, selling pressure was extremely strong, but buying interest remained strong. Numbers 10, 16, 26, 35, and 47, etc., were heavily sold, and the market price trended down by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Bank C was firm due to Number 77's buying, down only 0.05 yuan. The secondary and afternoon openings were both in swap trades between the long and short sides, with the market price fluctuating between 0.05 and 0.12 yuan, with highs and lows alternating. In the evening market, rumors spread that there were developments in finance, and buyers suddenly rose, with the upward trend becoming swift and fierce, becoming more intense later on. Number 32 first took the lead in buying, and the market sentiment was boosted. Numbers 6, 11, and 35 then followed, and the market temporarily saw a tight rise, with a maximum rise of 0.65 yuan. However, Number 11 sold a large amount of Type A, and the upward trend was slightly frustrated, but it was still good by 0.55 yuan. The trend seems to have a short squeeze possible. As a result, only the current month of Type E and D were down a small 0.25 yuan, while the rest all turned up by 0.05 to 0.67 yuan. The total transaction volume was 11,182,500 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction sheet unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn, Cotton Seedlings Growing Well, Spot Cotton Increasingly Soft, This Month's Old Cotton Falls Another 0.75 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton market is softening, with US cotton falling and Indian cotton also lackluster. New domestic cotton is about to enter the market, the climate is good, which is conducive to cotton seedling growth, people's hearts are increasingly frustrated, especially those who have inventory, and the market price is falling step by step.</p>
<p>New Cotton Approaching the 40 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, US cotton continued to fall by 12 to 18 points, and Indian cotton was dark and dull. Each month fell by 0.2 to 0.25 yuan. However, after entering the market, due to the yarn market improving and prices approaching the 40 yuan mark, the short side also acted cautiously, and the hovering power was extremely large. The market sentiment was stable, and it slowly recovered. However, the current weather is favorable, which is conducive to agricultural production and growth. According to various news sources, cotton production is thriving, and there is no lack of sellers during rises. At the close, it was again sluggish, and as a result, each month fell by 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's close, and August fell by 0.5 yuan. The afternoon opening saw continued exhaustion and weakness in the market trend, and buyers were scarce. As a result, May fell by another 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the morning close, and August fell by 0.45 yuan alone. The following sources of capital: Yu Kang 1,100 bales, Yuan Da 1,300 bales, Geng Feng 3,400 bales, Yong Yu 1,800 bales, Yi Cheng 6,900 bales, Zhen Da 1,300 bales, He Xing 1,300 bales, Xin Cheng 1,200 bales, Tong Ji bought 1,800 bales, Ju Xing 3,200 bales, Sen Kang 1,800 bales, Ren Feng 3,100 bales, Tai Chang 1,700 bales, Chang Feng 2,000 bales, Yuan Yi 2,000 bales, and Xin Chang 1,200 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Still Not Open for Trading</p>
<p>The current cotton consumption is mediocre, factories are sluggish, and there is no source, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, with a sluggish trend. This is because the overseas yarn and cotton conditions are moving downstream, people's hearts are empty, and at the same time, current yarn sales are less. However, Sichuanese merchants are still doing well, while other merchants are buying even less. In fact, new cotton is gradually entering the market, and the short side is becoming bolder. However, the inventory of yarn is thinner than before, it is said.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Falls Another Yuan Weak</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, Grade 3 US cotton yarn and cotton continued to fall, and the market sentiment softened. However, new sellers were not seen to be very enthusiastic, and the market was soft and hard. Each month only fell by 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. After the second session, it was heard that Sichuan merchants were eagerly buying in for this yarn, and Dafu heavily covered shorts, and the market price slowly rebounded. However, Geng Feng's long side slightly closed out, and the market situation was peaceful. As a result, each month fell by 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's close, and September and October rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a flat and weak market situation, and trading was not smooth in the market. The sentiment was scattered, and it was generally impossible to get rid of the hovering situation. It was heard that a portion of the yarn from Sichuan merchants had not been negotiated and had not been traded, and the market sentiment was sluggish. As a result, each month fell by another 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.8 yuan compared to the morning close. The following sales were recorded: De Da 550 bales, Heng Yi 600 bales, Ju Xing 1,150 bales, Da Feng 2,950 bales, Geng Feng 1,000 bales, Rui Da 800 bales, Xie Cheng 1,150 bales, Yuan Da 500 bales, Ming De 500 bales, Chang He 550 bales. Da Fu bought 3,500 bales, He Xing 650 bales, Sen Kang 700 bales, Heng Chang 800 bales, Da Chang 950 bales, Sheng Yuan 750 bales, and Yi Chang 750 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Sales Are Less</p>
<p>The total number of bales bought by various merchants throughout the day was 743 bales, with Sichuan merchants accounting for 500 bales. The selling price was average. The purchase amount of each merchant is as follows:</p>

<h3>The First National Cotton Production Estimate Announced Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the first national cotton production estimate for 1936 at 5:00 PM on August 20, 1936, as follows: Cotton field area 338,172,310 ares (equivalent to 55,041,066 old system mu)</p>

<h3>US Cotton Closing Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton opening market was sluggish, still awaiting developments in Europe. Early morning traders and local merchants bought in, and a negative report came out. The market price rose, but then the public sold, and the long side painfully closed out. The western situation was uncertain, and the south and central Texas were reported to have rain. The market price fell. It now needs to be calm, and factories have slightly traded. At the close, the market suddenly softened, with spot falling 18 points and futures falling 13 and 14 points. British cotton spot fell 10 points and futures fell 3 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to a few speculators buying in, but then fell due to showers in Karachi, with Ping Gu Er falling 0.75 rupees, Omla not moving, and Bai Luo Creek falling 1.25 rupees. The original telegram records are on the left (telegram of the 19th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 20th was: 7-8 month Bai Luo Creek at 221 rupees, down 1.5 rupees; 4-5 month Bai Luo Creek at 210 rupees, down 0.5 rupees; 12-1 month Omla at 191 rupees, down 0.75 rupees. Grade 3 yarn also fell. The Osaka telegram on the 20th reported that Grade 3 futures yarn rose and fell by 0.1 to 0.9 yuan, with the near month at 207 yuan and the far month at 200.08 yuan. Futures cotton fell 0.1 to 0.25 yuan, with the near month at 64.95 yuan and the far month at 62.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Patterned Cloth Sells Well, White Goods Alone Feel Sluggish</h3>
<p>As the cotton yarn situation deteriorates day by day, the cloth market, which is closely related, is also gradually showing signs of fatigue. In addition, the Guizhou situation is uneasy, and sales in the southwest may be hit. Eastern white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, and 84 cloth are sluggish due to the dyeing factory's weak buying interest. Customers from Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi are reducing their needs. As the end of the month for paying silver is approaching, they are all inclined to sell, and each brand has fallen by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per piece. However, Shanghai Yarn Factory of Japanese Merchants, due to receiving the most foreign orders, its products, such as Blue Sun Baby fine cloth and fine twill, and Five Yuan Baby coarse twill, are uniquely outstanding due to their extremely scarce output. Although the white goods sales of this factory are sluggish, the selling prices are still stable. Colored goods, such as various colored twill, gray twill, and blue cloth, are not selling well and have also fallen by 0.05 yuan per piece. However, printed and finished cloth is still trending stable. Lun Chang, Heng Feng, Guang Zhong, and other factories' printed velvet flower direct tribute flower drill colored satin, are being purchased in Tianjin, Jinan, Nanchang, and other districts in this street, and the selling prices are also quite stable. Shipments to the Yangtze River basin in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are still frequent, with the majority being previous orders. In addition to the patterned cloth from Tianjin, Yantai, and Jinan in the north, the finishing goods of various Chinese factories, woolen cloth, and 16-pound coarse cloth and 12-pound three-rabbit coarse twill are also continuing to be well received, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yuan Fang Piece Goods See a Slight Improvement, Feather Silk Prices Are Quite Lively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, the third-hundredth Yuan Fang auction was held, displaying 41 brands of goods, totaling 52 boxes. The usual bleached fine cloth and red and blue cloth, as well as white cotton yarn and white pongee, were not listed because no goods had arrived from overseas. The first auction was for six brands of Taisi satin, among which the Four Beasts had not been listed for a long time. The crowd praised that they were still quite outstanding, and the prices of each product were up 0.02 to 0.03 yuan per yard compared to the previous period. There were two brands of Yuan Rong, totaling five boxes, which were all inferior. The price of one brand of straight woolen cloth increased by 0.05 yuan. A total of 32 brands of feather silk were auctioned, and the prices of the listed goods were energetic. The price of bamboo forest brand piece goods rose by 0.975 yuan. The remaining Luan Feng rose by 0.6 yuan, An Dian Bao rose by 0.7 yuan, and most prices rose. The addition of the Sea, Sky, People, Ball, and Five Stars brands had reasonable prices. However, the goods taken by Sanjun Denggao Commercial, the Four Haos brand, fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Polish Woolen Cloth Market Is Very Lively, Because Its Value Is Cheap and Cannot Be Compared with Goods from Other Countries</h3>
<p>Polish woolen cloth has continued to be purchased by traders on this street yesterday, as inventory is lacking and autumn sales are making great progress. Everyone is optimistic. Currently, the trends of woolen cloth such as Melton, rotten paste woolen cloth, plain thick woolen cloth, yellow woolen cloth, embossed water ripple head woolen cloth, low-grade overcoat woolen cloth, and herringbone woolen cloth are better than other goods because the quality is too poor, few British goods have arrived, there are still no domestic products, and Japanese Great Cow goods cannot be woven due to their low prices, it is said. Ruiwen No. 3000 plain thick woolen cloth, Xinchun He purchased more than 20 boxes, priced at 3 yuan net. Baoda Melton Yi purchased 14 boxes, priced at 2.2 yuan. In addition, Xin Chang imported four boxes of twill flower thin overcoat woolen cloth, priced at 2.7 yuan. Cheng Da imported more than 30 boxes of No. 4000 plain thick woolen cloth, priced at 1.85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhen Mei Green Tea Slightly Eager to Open</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Tea Industry Association reported that the prices discussed by various firms for Zhen Mei in the green tea market the day before yesterday saw a few transactions yesterday. Hua Tea bought over 100 boxes of Wu Zhen, priced at 68 yuan. Xie He also bought over 100 boxes, and 200 pieces of Jian Xiu Mei, priced at 17 to 30+ yuan. The selling price was also worse than before. Tong Fu and Yong Xing each had dozens of pieces of drawn Zhen that were transacted, priced at over 100 yuan. Various firms continued to discuss Zhen Mei, and transactions may be made soon. In Ping Shui Tea, Long continued to handle the Deli gang, priced at 38.25 yuan. Xie He disassembled a large box of Jin Guorui gang, and imported 100+ boxes of Gao Zhuang Tou Zhu, priced at 63 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Another interview report said that yesterday's silk and tea market conditions were uneven. For the Luzhuang Zhen Mei and Xia Mu items, Lianying Zhuang, Xie He, Yi He, and Tong Fu continued to aggressively replenish inventory because foreign telegrams indicated a greater demand. The market price of body-quality pearl tea suddenly became firm. Zhen Mei and Xiu Mei items were also unchanged from before. Although Zhen Mei green tea (ordinary village goods) slightly showed an eager activity trend, the draw-core hoarding was very high, and low-grade goods were even more sluggish. The market conditions still showed a trend of falling without rising. The total transaction volume of green tea from various sources in the city was over 1,200 boxes. Apart from pearl tea, which was still stable, the rest were weak, it is said.</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Market Hovers with a Weakening Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, generally showed a hovering trend in each month. As for imported wheat quotes, Chicago was slightly better by 0.10 yuan in the near term and slightly worse by 0.06 yuan in the far term. Canadian wheat was slightly worse by 0.10 yuan. When the prices were opened, this month had been scheduled to stop trading on the 26th, so both the long and short sides sought to close out. The initial market once fell to as low as 0.13125 yuan, and September and October were also very flat. However, in December, due to the smooth intake of foreign firms, it suddenly improved by more than 0.01 yuan. By the second session, this month had entered a fixed position, and the far-term market became flat and tired due to factory outlets. Compared with the initial opening, it fell back by about 0.01 yuan. Observing the subsequent steps, if actual sales do not rise, it may have to return to a weak point, it is said.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Rises Another 0.04-0.05 Yuan After Short Covering; Spot Factories Open Over 10,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed an initially flat and then stable trend in each month in the morning opening. Because imported wheat quotes had very little fluctuation, the prices called were similar to before. Then, due to short covering, the buying sentiment was healthier, and the prices of each month gradually rose. Apart from this month, which had little fluctuation, the rest all rose by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Because the psychology of the general public still considers imported wheat difficult to plan for, and domestic wheat sales have not been sluggish, the selling sentiment died down, and people's hearts easily proposed higher prices. The current wheat market is still solid because the origin quotes have not been lowered yet. For example, local goods from Suzhou and other places have been called up to 8.3 yuan or even 8.5 yuan. In various places in northern Jiangsu, the price to Shanghai has reached 5.3 to 5.4 yuan, so specialty goods from merchants in the southern city have been opened to 5.5625 to 5.575 yuan. As for the various grades of matching factories, they were generally similar to the previous day, with high-grade goods selling for a large 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. It is estimated that the city opened up to over 10,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>River Rice High-Quality Goods Still Popular</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's sources from various merchants only arrived from the 17th and 18th, with a total of 3,400 to 3,500 shi. Sales in this street were small, and Qingdao and Dalian merchants only bought 500+ bags, so the market situation continued to be thinner, and the market prices of both thick and thin japonica rice were all short by several cents to nearly one yuan. Duyangjian lacked supply and remained firm, Yinbianyuan was flat, and Dongxin arrived with a total of over 1,000 shi, and sales were weaker, with prices down a small 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the goods from various rivers arrived on the 14th and 16th. In the market, high-quality goods of various colors moved slightly, while medium and low-quality goods were very sluggish. The market price of white japonica rice, Yangjian, and thin paddy high-quality goods was down a small fraction, and medium and low-quality goods were down about 0.1 yuan. Yinbianyuan high-quality goods were flat, and medium and low-quality goods were down a small fraction. The remaining goods were all exhausted. Dongxin japonica rice was down 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Smoothly Handle New Coarse Xian Rice, Market Price Rises Again by 0.1 to 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw strong arrivals and even more active digestion. The new arrivals were mainly early coarse new goods, such as Hanzhou, Jiangxi, Jiangbei, Taizhou, and other ports that had large batches arriving in Shanghai. However, yesterday the sales suddenly became strong, and Guangzhou merchants suddenly smoothly handled new coarse rice in the market, with 5,000+ bags of Hanzhou and Nanjing coarse rice being traded in the market. In addition, the shipping company directly allocated another 5,000 to 6,000 bags. It is estimated that Guangdong merchants handled over 10,000 bags in total, and the taste buds of merchants in the North, Xiamen, and Ningbo in this street were also sweet. The North's appetite was also gradually lively, and 1,200 bags of Xiangjing were sold yesterday, and the stomach must continue to be handled later. The full-day transaction was 1,100 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,100 bags of Xiang rice, 5,000 bags of Han coarse rice, 112 bags of Taizhou new rice, and 600+ bags of Jiangbei Nanjing, etc. In addition, more than 6,000 bags of Ke coarse rice were allocated, and the prices were similar. Due to the activities of the Guangdong merchants, the market price of coarse rice immediately rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the other various Ji rice also varied greatly, ranging from a few cents to nearly one yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Qingchi Sugar House Slightly Looser</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The association's plate for 24 coarse sand white sugar, spot goods, was transacted at 21.83 yuan, up a small 0.02 yuan. Transit goods were called at 6.8 yuan. Transit Dutch red was 5.85 yuan, and there were also drawdowns. Eastern white was still soft, and No. 4 (T) marked 21.45 yuan, transit 6.45 yuan, with a water loss of 0.05 yuan. No. 8 (N) marked transit goods down a small 0.05 yuan to 6.25 yuan, and spot goods were 21.25 yuan. YRO marked 6 yuan, down a small fraction. The prices of white cotton made in this factory were all called at the original price, and the plate number was slightly more active. Chao Merchants opened a batch of cotton red, totaling 49 bags of Shihe Red, at 15.8 yuan, 101 bags of priced Hechi, at 15.5 yuan, and 109 bags of Caiji Red, at 15 yuan, which was slightly looser than before. Huanggang Qing Dachang Zhuang 47 bags, at 13.8 yuan, and Tongxing Zhuang 40 bags, at 13.6 yuan, were slightly looser than before. Dachang threw away 500 bags of October Dutch Red, priced at 2.52 Dutch currency, down a small fraction.</p>
<h3>By the Banks of the Kuntulun River</h3>
<p>— Ba</p>
<p>The fiery red sun rose from the eastern horizon, the wind departed from the grasslands, and the distant mountains gradually emerged from the thick morning mist. The Kuntulun River flowed silently, the dense leaves of the poplar trees on its banks gleaming under the sunlight, shimmering and twinkling with the gentle breeze, like still water on a calm lake. Beyond the poplar forest lay a lush expanse of slender reeds, dividing the boundless desert. Yellow sand interspersed with green belts, a brilliant and dotted landscape, like a natural painting, how intoxicating a wilderness! Especially the gurgling water of the Kuntulun River, as if someone were playing music.</p>
<p>At night, my elder brother caught a chill, waking up with a hacking cough. Xikui hastily rummaged through his leather bag for "aspirin," but my brother stopped him:</p>
<p>——Don't bother, I won't get sick. Let the camel driver pack the luggage; let's go stroll along the river, stroll through the woods.</p>
<p>The four of us, hand in hand, walked through the thickets, singing mountain songs from our hometowns, running and jumping into the poplar forest. I plucked some unknown wildflowers and held them in my hands. Little Fan grabbed a branch, pulling himself closer and then letting go, until he finally fell on the grass, and we all burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Just a few steps out of the woods was the Kuntulun River. We walked upstream along the riverbank, chatting and laughing. Suddenly, a gazelle (note) ran across the beach. Xikui quickly shouldered his rifle and aimed, but after the shot rang out, the gazelle had already changed direction and run off. My brother scolded Xikui for wasting a shot. As he spoke, a Mongolian man on horseback galloped towards us from behind, wearing a sheepskin robe, his long braid hitting his back. The sunlight shone upon him, and his robe was greasy and gleaming, as if it had been painted. He carried a large bird gun in his hand, and three gazelles were tied to the horse's back. He stopped in front of us, and spoke to us, in very beautiful Mandarin!</p>
<p>Little Fan seized the opportunity again, asking him all sorts of questions. I didn't pay attention to what they were saying, but carefully observed the hunter's attire. He wore gray felt socks inside his leather boots, making his feet look very clumsy. His belt was adorned with a tobacco pouch, a fire striker, a small knife, a cow horn, and many other odds and ends. As we were talking, another gazelle ran by. The hunter raised his gun, and with a "bang," the gazelle fell with a cry. He immediately opened the cow horn and loaded the gun with gunpowder before running to pick up the gazelle.</p>
<p>My brother thought it was very amusing when he heard the Mongolian hunter ask, "Has Wu Peifu taken office yet!" Filled with curiosity, he wanted to talk to him for a while longer, but the camel driver was calling, saying it was getting late, and we quickly ran back. The camel driver had already packed up the tents and luggage. So, we mounted the camels and set off along the riverbank.</p>
<p>After passing through a stretch of desert, a dense forest appeared to the west, beyond which was an endless expanse of green grassland. After walking for a while, we saw the herds of the ancient girls grazing on the grassland, such a large group! There were camels, horses, and sheep. Young girls were tying red wildflowers to the sheep's horns. The sheep jumped and bleated. The shepherds, drowsy from the sheep's light, lay on the grass, dreaming sweet dreams.</p>
<p>Around noon, we found a Mongolian yurt in a dense thicket. We decided to stop here for a quick meal. When we got off the camels, our legs were so numb that we couldn't stand. We moved around for a while before we could walk freely. So, we ordered the camel driver to set up the stove and cook. We took the opportunity to go see the yurt.</p>
<p>We were all filled with curiosity and a sense of adventure, and walked towards the yurt without hesitation. From afar, a black dog barked and ran towards us. I was so frightened that I hid behind my brother. Before I knew it, a woman came running out of the yurt, stopped the dog, and smiled happily as she invited us into the yurt. A man was squatting on the ground, looking somewhat like a Han Chinese, skinning a rabbit. He immediately dropped what he was doing and came to greet us. The woman brought hot milk tea, her eyes constantly sizing up the guests.</p>
<p>We all sat on the left side of the Buddha statue, while the man held the child and sat at the lower seat. The man sat on the lower seat on the right side, with a pipe in his mouth. Although there was a felt window at the top of the yurt, the air and light felt insufficient, and there was a peculiar smoky odor inside. I took long, slow breaths and talked with the man for a while, learning that he was a Han Chinese from Yulin County, Shaanxi, and coincidentally from our hometown.</p>
<p>Judging by his expression, he seemed to miss his hometown. He asked many questions, making his memories of home even more beautiful and endearing. As he talked about his experiences in the Ejina Banner, a five- or six-year-old child ran in from the felt door and, seeing these unfamiliar strangers, jumped into his mother's arms in surprise, his eyes fixed on us.</p>
<p>——If it weren't for my wife and children, I would have gone home long ago!</p>
<p>When asked about the route to Outer Mongolia, he explained in great detail, telling us how long it would take to get from here to Suoguo, where to find wells, and all the way to Shalen Kuduk and Xila Usu. After drinking our fill of tea, we said goodbye, and he stopped at the door.</p>
<p>As soon as we stepped into the reeds, we ran into a lama:</p>
<p>—Where are you going?</p>
<p>—To Outer Mongolia!</p>
<p>—I'm afraid it won't be easy. The Kherlen area has long forbidden outsiders from passing through!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this lama spoke such fluent Mandarin. After asking him carefully, we learned that he was from Rehe and had been to Kulun. We walked through the reeds and looked back at him, and he had already entered the Mongolian yurt we had just visited.</p>
<p>The camel driver was sweating profusely and was a little angry, muttering:</p>
<p>—If you leave me alone to cook again, I'm quitting! I have to fetch water, start the fire, and take care of the camels. How can I manage?</p>
<p>The sky and the earth were vast. Stretched out on the camel's back to look at the incessant stream, grass insects were knocking on the wings, coming and going in the grass on both shores. Camel hooves walked on the hard sand. The sun gradually set to the west, through the sand forest, in front and a prairie appeared, the dusk retreating light, the camels cried, and we began to search for the location with water, couldn't find one, so there was no way but to go forward, slowly heard the dog barking, there must be people nearby, that's how we were relieved.</p>
<p>We found a Mongolian encampment and went in. A couple were already asleep, and five or six lamas were sitting around the stove talking. We asked them where we could find water. A young lama led me to a patch of green grass, where there was a small well, so that we could start cooking. By the time the camel driver had set up the tent, a strong wind had swept in from the desert again.</p>
<p>Note: The gazelle is a type of wild goat found in the desert.</p>
<h3>Mourning</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>This is the second time I've picked up my pen to commemorate a student.</p>
<p>Since coming here to teach, one thing has pleased me, and that is that several students have exceeded my expectations in their literary achievements. I often thought to myself: if they are nurtured properly, I will surely see these elites blossom and bear fruit in the future. Who knew that human hope often only flashes briefly before turning into utter darkness.</p>
<p>Last year, after the student with the surname Hou died of meningitis, not only was I personally grieved, but every student in his entire grade shed tears, especially Xian Si, who shared the same interests. At that time, we selected and printed one of Hou's usual writing assignments, and I added a eulogistic note at the end, which was distributed to all the students in the school as a memento. Anyone who read this piece of writing couldn't help but exclaim, "What a pity for such a genius! Why doesn't heaven let us fools die instead!" Later, in the composition class, I gave the topic of commemorating Hou, and as a result, I received a whole batch of excellent papers, each one written with tears and ink. I, too, drew circle after circle on them, with tears scalding my face. I remember that Xian Si's essay was especially heart-wrenching; his writing was already somewhat sentimental, and such a fitting topic naturally allowed him to blossom flowers of sorrow in the pale ink.</p>
<p>Who would believe that, on the same textbook, under the same topic, students would now have to write essays to commemorate him?</p>
<p>Yes, who would believe it? Even as I write this commemorative text in front of the small lamp, it seems as if he is not really gone forever, never to return to this world, never to return to this small lamp to recite his poems to me.</p>
<p>"Chen Xiansi's poetry is sure to achieve great success!"</p>
<p>I often spread this phrase everywhere with my trumpet-like mouth, spreading it to all the students in the school, spreading it to my friends, wishing I could spread it so that everyone in the world would know about this genius, and only then would I be happy. This was a bit of an impulsive feeling that made me do this. Sure enough, this publicity worked, and no one in the entire school was unaware of this poet. Whether his classmates were joking with him or talking to him seriously, they would all call him "poet," and the word "poet" simply became a proper noun that existed for him alone. Don't laugh; the title had no trace of irony in it, and he—Chen Xiansi—certainly lived up to the name without blushing. He could write the line "Paste a thousand taels of gold on your eyelids" under the topic of autumn; his imagination had wings. When God created him, he had poetized his constitution and temperament.</p>
<p>He was a child from a declining family, and his environment was already somewhat difficult. He was barely able to study, relying entirely on his elder brother doing some small jobs here, taking a little bit from his meager salary to support him. He also happened to have a habit of buying literary books. Novels from various authors, complete bound magazines, were lined up on his small desk, especially poetry collections, which he loved even more. Last year, he was very annoyed because he couldn't buy Dead Water, and finally spent several nights copying the entire thing into a pocket-sized booklet in neat calligraphy. This made him extremely happy. He would read it today, read it tomorrow, and whenever he came across a sentence he didn't really understand, he would come to me, explain it once, and then we would read it together again.</p>
<p>To be honest, it wasn't entirely my guidance that allowed him to write such good poems. He had fallen in love with poetry before I came. At that time, my "good friend," who was teaching him Mandarin, would sometimes send me his poems to look at, introducing him in the letter as, "Look, isn't his poetry well-written? This is our poet." From this, I remembered his name clearly. After I came, the first person to come to my room to talk about literature was him. From the style of this novelist to the style of that poet, from China to foreign countries, and finally dragging in some anecdotes from the literary world, if I hadn't usually paid attention to these situations, I would have been speechless and red-faced.</p>
<p>From then on, my small room often had his footprints. He would come at any time; sometimes, after the bedtime bell had already rung, I was busy grading papers, and he would come, perhaps with a poem by someone else, or one of his own. At this time, I would slam my pen on the inkstone, and my heart would jump out of a tedious circle. With the joy coming from the bottom of my heart, we would talk about poetry, forgetting how much time had passed, only feeling a little dry in my mouth. When I went to pour a cup of tea that I had just brewed to drink, I touched it and found that it was already too cold to drink.</p>
<p>After getting closer to me, the clear stream of his poetry seemed to become more lively. Every few days, he would always send several poems for me to read, and I really loved to read them. I remember once, it was already very late at night, and after reading one of his poems, (already published in the Literary Guide? I can't remember clearly anymore.) I was so happy that I jumped up and down a few times! (That beautiful sentence, I can still recite it for you now!) That night, it was raining heavily, but I didn't care, and without even taking an umbrella, I ran all the way to his dormitory. He was alone, guarding a small lamp, planning to sleep. I rushed in and took out his poem from my pocket and recited it. After reciting it, I dropped a bunch of encouraging words, turned around, pushed open the door, and ran out. When I returned to my room, I felt cold all over, my fingers like ten icicles. I lay down, and my heart was pounding. The next day, he told me that he had tossed and turned in bed all night.</p>
<p>Later, I introduced his poems to various magazines and supplements, and at the same time introduced him to some young enthusiasts (who have now all published poetry collections). I remember once, a friend who edited a literary supplement asked me face-to-face: "Why don't you use your real name and instead chose the pen name Chen Xiansi?" I laughed. After I told him the truth, that friend also laughed. Xiansi's poetry was originally very ethereal, but it is true that his style changed a bit after being influenced by me. "Why not let the student establish his own style?" To this friend's question, I could only respond with another laugh.</p>
<p>The students in this class have a tendency to make friends. Each person has his or her close friends. Xiansi and Xing were very good friends. They had been together in elementary school, and after coming here, they were even more inseparable. Xiansi's temper was like an unguided wind, blowing in whatever direction he pleased. To be honest, he was simply too childish, but realistically, he was just an eighteen-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Once, he came to say goodbye to me, saying that he was about to leave the school. I asked in surprise, "Why?" The answer was also very simple: he couldn't keep up with his studies! I could understand this difficulty very well. It was impossible for a middle school student to focus his energy on one thing. He said that mathematics was simply a headache, which couldn't help but remind me of the heartache I had suffered from mathematics in middle school. I had tasted this bitterness, and I comforted him with all sorts of words, trying to stabilize his heart. I said that a poet cannot only recite and write poetry; that is not enough. I managed to calm his lion-like heart. Because he was too fond of literature, he couldn't develop his studies evenly. I had heard a lot of gossip from others, and he must have heard it too. Since it was gossip, we could just ignore it.</p>
<p>Xing was his older brother, and should be in terms of age. They lived in the same room, studied together, and even slept with their feet touching at night. Once his childish temper flared up, it was Xing's turn to wear out his tongue. Last spring, Xing suddenly came to me, his face looking bitter. As soon as he saw me, he said, "Xiansi suddenly shaved his head yesterday and decided to become a monk." I understood that the older brother had already run out of options for him, so he came to me for this magic weapon. Why would a young man want to shave his head and become a monk? There's a little story here.</p>
<p>Why did he want to be a monk for no reason?</p>
<p>I called him to my room, rested my chin on my hand, and asked him straight away, staring at him with both eyes, but with a smile on my lips.</p>
<p>"……" He couldn't answer a word, and kept touching the little white cap on top of his head with his right hand, his cheeks red, wanting to laugh and wanting to cry.</p>
<p>"A person can't be so uncertain. Even if your affair with Miss ××× doesn't work out for the time being, you can't do this. She has always been very good to you. How can a father casually promise his daughter to a stranger? You are really too childish!"</p>
<p>I saw his face turn even redder. Perhaps his heart was pounding?</p>
<p>Really, this girl held his heart. Their friendship was very good. His literary books were often placed by her pillow. Although they were separated in different schools, his little brother happily became his little brother (this year, in addition to him and Xing, there was a small child coming in and out). The little brother became the red娘 (matchmaker) delivering letters. I heard that when her father wanted to promise his daughter to someone else, the child cried and made a big fuss at home.</p>
<p>There was another thing that made him sad (perhaps a curse that hastened his death?), and that was the death of his sister and father. For his dead sister, he had written several sad poems, truly very sad, and I was really afraid to read them. The dilapidated family was like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, and people gradually withered with poverty. Once, and this was said very recently, just about two months ago, I gave the composition topic "A Letter to My Father." I walked back and forth in the classroom with my hands behind my back, and everyone else was writing happy words on their textbooks. When I patrolled to the northeast corner, I suddenly found him biting his pen and crying. A sudden wave of sadness washed over me, and I couldn't help but hate myself, hating myself for giving such a topic when there were people here who had just lost their fathers. Thinking of this, I immediately made a statement to everyone: those who have lost their fathers can write to their mothers and brothers. After saying this, I secretly walked towards the front and never dared to turn my eyes to the northeast again. In the end, his letter was still written to his father, but it also described his mother—an old, sickly, and weak woman. This letter was too sad, but fortunately, his father could no longer read it.</p>
<p>The three years of junior high school were about to end this semester. Since he had endured until now, he would of course have to fight to the death to grab that diploma (he called it a meal ticket, telling me: graduating from junior high school is enough, my family can't afford to support me, and I need to support my family!). All sorts of subjects were like a tangled mess, pressing hard on his heart. He had always been somewhat unfamiliar with books, and how could he suddenly turn around and become a familiar friend at this time? Moreover, the hurdles of exams were one after another: weekly exams, monthly exams, school exams, provincial exams.</p>
<p>I hadn't seen him much in the past few months, and he hadn't sent any poems either. I knew why. A month ago, he suddenly came down automatically in the composition class. I was staring blankly at the spring sun outside the window at this time. When I saw him coming out, I asked:</p>
<p>"Why did you come down?"</p>
<p>"A bit of a headache!"</p>
<p>And so he went to the dormitory, his back a last time.</p>
<p>Two days later, someone told me that he had gone home to seek treatment. I felt that this child had probably committed another rebellious act, and that his illness was just a plausible excuse to avoid the exams. Most of his classmates guessed this as well.</p>
<p>A few days passed again. At a friend's wedding feast, I heard the news of his serious illness, and my heart immediately turned from joy to sorrow.</p>
<p>Two more days passed. One night, after watching a flood movie, a classmate suddenly ran into my room and said, "Chen Xiansi is dead!" That night, I closed my eyes tightly, seeming to be clear-headed, but his shadow flashed before my face, clear and blurry.</p>
<p>The next morning, I carried a heavy burden and wanted to go up to the west city to clear my mind. As soon as I stepped out of the gate, I ran into a drunk, smoking a cigarette, his eyes like two red peaches, his feet staggered by the wind, like a pair of oars in a rapid current. As soon as he saw me, he cried out, but he couldn't actually cry. I forcefully supported him to my room, put him on the bed, and covered his face with a cold towel. I was about to pour a cup of strong tea to cool down his heart fire when he suddenly started rolling around. In this situation, I dared not say words of comfort other than to accompany him in tears. He held his head in both hands, his feet gripping the edge of the bed, and the smell of alcohol permeated the small room. Before two minutes had even passed, before I could even ask someone to pour tea, he suddenly got up and wanted to leave! He had to leave! I understood that no place could calm him down at this time. He had to leave, to go from here to there, and perhaps after getting there, he would have to go to another place. I supported him, hanging my head and letting my tears fall silently on the ground, away from countless eyes. …</p>
<p>On the day of his burial, Xing didn't dare to go, fearing that his mother would be saddened to see him. According to other classmates who came back to report, his mother was simply crazy, asking all day long if any family had a dead female student, wanting to arrange a ghost marriage for him.</p>
<p>After he was buried, Xing came to my room and brought two things, one was a four-inch photograph of Xiansi that had been taken recently, which he had entrusted to Xing to give to me before he fell ill. The other was a book of poems, selected by himself, with beautiful handwriting, already in its final draft, with revisions in black ink on the blue ink text, titled "My Poems." Opening the first page, he wrote a line: "Emotions like fleeting dreams."</p>
<p>Xing also told me that he had always hoped to publish a book of poems when he was alive. I agreed, promising to find a way to publish it for him in the future (with a preface written by me), so that he would have a collection like the other young poets I had introduced. Xing said that if he was lucky enough to graduate, he would not study anymore. The students in the entire school repeated the phrase "What a pity for such a genius, why don't heaven let us fools die instead," and the essays written by his classmates in mourning for him were all excellent, but this time there was no book from Xing.</p>

<h3>Little Alian Getting Beaten</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Dad beats me every day,</p>

<p>Not because I'm mischievous,</p>
<p>Nor because Alian is disobedient;</p>
<p>It's just that the machines scared Dad,</p>
<p>Ever since the work stopped that time,</p>
<p>Dad learned to drink alcohol,</p>
<p>Once he comes home,</p>
<p>Nothing is right,</p>
<p>He grabs Alian and beats and scolds.</p>
<p>He scolds me for being a useless girl,</p>
<p>He scolds me that I will starve to death someday:</p>
<p>Scolding and scolding,</p>
<p>He first sheds bean-like tears.</p>
<p>Mom doesn't like to beat, only likes to scold:</p>
<p>Scolds me for showing off,</p>
<p>Scolds me for talking too much,</p>
<p>Scolds me to learn well,</p>
<p>Scolds me not to be greedy for play.</p>
<p>Mom doesn't care if others scold me,</p>
<p>But if I scold other people's moms, she scolds me.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get angry and hide under the thatched shed,</p>
<p>Dad comes looking, Mom calls,</p>

<h3>The Positivity of Satirical Literature</h3>
<p>— Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>What is satirical literature? In the past, there were Lin Linjun's "Advocacy of Satirical Poetry" in the four issues of "Poetry" and Zhang Xiangshan's "The Rise of Japanese Satirical Literature" published in the Shenbao Special Edition. However, recently, Zhang's "On Satirical Literature" and Bei Ou's "Two or Three Thoughts on Satirical Literature" published in the "Dongliu" Innovation issue have caught my attention. In Zhang's essay, the emergence of satirical literature and the qualitative changes it undergoes under specific historical conditions in various eras are explained in detail, but it overlooks what weapons and strategies satirical literature should grasp to address the current reality of China. As for Bei Ou's thoughts, they are even further from our requirements. He is confined to exposing and satirizing the petty bourgeoisie and Gorky's theories, without considering the distance between the development processes of the Soviet Union and China and the requirements of objective situations. Thus, he narrowed the scope of "thoughts." In fact, in such a serious situation in China, the petty bourgeoisie, who are trapped in a declining fate and the invasion of terror, must also be on their toes. They are also working for their own survival. On the united front, they will at least go from watching and cursing to participating in attacking the common enemy, but their unique volatility cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the social basis for the emergence of satirical literature. Generally speaking, during the period of transition of the times, that is, when the existing social system itself contains the deepening of its contradictions and the various elements that give rise to its own transformation are increasingly surfacing, one party is desperately struggling to continue its dying breath, and in order to prevent "transformation" and eliminate "transformation," it does not hesitate to use cruel political means. At such times, literature, as one of the elements of "transformation," often adopts the form of satire as a side attack to avoid frontal conflict. For example, the pungent satire of the German poet Heine and the venomous satire of the Russian poet Belinsky cause the enemy to feel pain from the bone marrow. But there are also those who belong to the ruling class, deeply feeling the powerlessness of the powerful and the increasing decline, corruption, and ugliness of their class, and adopt cynical, sentimental exposure as an elegy-like alarm bell, such as Molière and Gogol. But even more standing on the opposite position, those of the declining class who are still remaining feel uncomfortable with the new social organization and the new reality of life, and recall the old dreams of the past, fantasizing about the reproduction of the social system or that way of life, and as a result, fall into a more pitiful tragic situation, using ridicule as their elegy, the most prominent being Cervantes' "Don Quixote" in the seventeenth century. And even more wonderful and sharp are the recent masterpieces by Soviet writers Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov, such as "The Twelve Chairs" and "The Little Golden Calf."</p>
<p>Although it is said that "satire" originates from "laughter," this "laughter" is organized, spiritual, and technical laughter. Only in this way can it express a special kind of "satire" art in literature. Moreover, it is obvious that this art, with the passage of history and the repeated changes of social systems, has undergone changes and developments in its content and form. In particular, as a literary weapon we are currently adopting, it has special efficacy. This efficacy, needless to say, requires new creations based on our objective special conditions.</p>
<p>The so-called new creation is to emphasize the positivity of the theme in satire and the sharpness of the theme of satire. In the reality of our melting pot, there is no appearance of the funny character of "Don Quixote," nor does it flow out of Gogol's passive tearful cynicism, nor does it reach the leisurely, heated ridicule of Ilf et al. It is a sharp, vigorous, armed satire that forges a healthy spirit of resistance. Not only will the current biggest enemy suffer bone-piercing bee stings, but all conspirators wearing masks will also fully expose their pitiful appearances under the strong reflection of the demon-revealing mirror, and even more so, like enemy planes attacking at night being scanned by searchlights everywhere and countered by anti-aircraft guns, only in this way can satirical literature express its positivity and realize its current stage of mission.</p>

<h3>Peace and War</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The smell of gunpowder permeates the world, and the outbreak of the Second World War is only waiting for the burning of the fuse. However, while countries are preparing for war, the peace movement is not lost because of it. Yesterday, American peace envoy Mr. Todd came to China to persuade us to join the world peace movement. According to him, the movement advocates four points: (1) The sanctity of treaties, but China has the right to amend them; (2) Limiting and reducing armaments, and eliminating the profits of manufacturing munitions; (3) Strengthening the League of Nations, so that the solidarity of the union and the power of mutual assistance will be more effective and can oppose aggression; (4) Establishing a committee in the League of Nations that will exist permanently to resolve and alleviate international tensions and prevent war from breaking out.</p>
<p>The peace movement is not only beyond reproach, but also deeply worthy of approval, but this movement does not have much power at present and is in vain and futile. Because countries around the world are running on the road to war, and peace can only be arranged by force. Even if we cry out for peace, we cannot compete with the loudness of the killing sound. If the peace movement can really prevent the outbreak of war, militarism would have no place to use its force. The four propositions of the world peace movement are correct. But who is willing to implement them? The sacred treaty has become a waste of paper. The League of Nations has also lost its original power. This is the result of being trampled by force, and I am afraid that the peace movement cannot recover it. Originally, war has its causes, and war is unavoidable before the causes are eliminated. People who advocate peace should see this clearly.</p>
<p>American historian Ransom attributed the last World War to the following four causes: (1) Nationalism and territorial recoveryism; (2) Militarism and military alliances; (3) Economic opposition and imperialism; (4) International anarchy and secret diplomacy. This was the situation in 1914, but what is it like today? These reasons can be said to still exist. We don't want to waste more words on this matter. The fact is the best explanation. The driving force of war is taking effect, and the great catastrophe of mankind will soon come. In this crisis, it is conceivable that the peace movement will have little effect.</p>
<p>However, it is not absolutely hopeless for the world to maintain peace. Ransom said: If countries can eliminate the evils, injustices, and mistakes of the past, forget old hatreds and start over, the happiness of the future will be unlimited. We can also say that as long as a group of ambitious people abandon their aggressive behavior, the world will be peaceful. Unfortunately, this is just a luxury for those who advocate peace. War, in the eyes of some people, may be divinely ordained. Otherwise, why is the world shaking again under the threat of cannons?</p>
<h3>Impressions of Shanghai Orphanage (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>He led me into a conference room, specially ordered people to brew three cups of fine Mao tea, and then said very modestly: "Our hospital is run very imperfectly, and many inappropriate places still need to be corrected!"</p>
<p>The hospital was founded in the thirty-first year of Guangxu, and it has a history of more than 30 years; so far, it has taken in a total of more than 2,000 orphans of both sexes, and about 400 have graduated and left the hospital. At present, the hospital still has more than 400 orphans and more than 90 orphan girls, the youngest being eight or nine years old and the oldest being eighteen years old. The education part inside is a complete elementary school, divided into six grades, with a total of four classrooms; grades one and two have full-day classes, and grades three, four, five, and six are part-time work and study. Orphans graduate after six years, and after graduation, they are either taken back by their families or introduced to a job by the hospital. Among them, those who are gifted and promising are sent by the hospital to Xiangshan Orphanage or Shanghai Nanyang Middle School. Most of the graduates of the hospital are now serving in the business world, followed by military, medical, agricultural, industrial, newspaper, and postal circles.</p>
<p>In terms of curriculum, in addition to elementary school education, they must also learn various crafts, so that each orphan has a skill after leaving the hospital, so that they can make a living in society in the future. The current hospital has eleven types of art (including painting, sculpture, and other beautiful works), music, printing, binding, rattan work, bamboo work, carpentry, gardening, sewing, and embroidery, and sock knitting. However, girls only learn three courses: sewing, embroidery, and sock knitting. Except for embroidery, which is contracted by others, sewing and sock knitting are for the orphans in the hospital to use themselves.</p>
<p>The procedures for orphans to enter the hospital are very simple. Any poor and cold children only need to register at the hospital in advance. If there is a vacancy in the hospital, then first fill out a guarantee form and send it to the hospital. After the hospital directors approve it, they can be sent there. After entering the hospital, all the necessities of life, clothing, food, and housing are provided by the hospital, but the hospital does not charge any fees, and people are free to donate as much as they want.</p>
<p>There are currently eleven teachers, several technicians, seven staff members, and four nannies in the hospital, all of whom are semi-voluntary, and the arrangement of hospital affairs and the cleaning of various places are entirely served by orphans in rotation.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Now the hospital consumes more than three stones of rice per day. Usually, some of the vegetables are picked from their own garden, but they still have to buy several loads of vegetables from outside every day. They usually have meat four times a month, and every Sunday is the day for meat. The hospital's monthly operating expenses are 2,450 yuan, and about 30,000 yuan per year, of which 60% is food expenses.</p>
<p>The hospital has no basic funds and no subsidies from any party. The operating expenses are entirely maintained by donations from all walks of life and the hospital directors. However, in addition, the hospital also has a part of industrial production, about 2,000 yuan per year, which can also subsidize the hospital's economic shortage.</p>
<p>Some of the various handicrafts produced there are wholesaled, and some are displayed and sold at the entrance of the hospital.</p>
<p>Students with excellent grades in art are also rewarded by the hospital as usual, and the band that goes out to respond to invitations also gets a discount.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang stood up and said to us:</p>
<p>"Now please go inside and visit as you like, but at the moment because it is a holiday, everything is very messy, and many of the orphans have gone home."</p>
<p>The air in the hospital is very good, and the environment is very quiet: the whole hospital has 48 buildings and 32 bungalows, covering an area of about 20 acres, and the vegetable garden covers an area of about 10 acres. We followed a corridor past, first visited the office, library, medical room, grades one and two classrooms, grades three and four classrooms, grades five classroom, grades six classroom, and then went to visit their workshops. The bamboo work department is opposite the rattan work department, and the fine arts department is next to the indoor playground. Outside is the printing department (including lithography, etc.), and the binding department is attached here. Going out from the back is the horticulture department; in front is a large open-air playground, and opposite the playground is the dining hall. The dining hall is divided into four halls, each hall can accommodate 200 people, and each hall has a hall name plaque personally inscribed by Mr. Wang Yiting. Next to the dining hall is the music department. The carpentry department is outside. The girls' department is next to the reception room, and it is completely separated from the boys' department. There are more than a dozen houses inside, and the embroidery, sewing, and sock knitting classrooms are attached here. Each department has a technician in charge of teaching, and the students are all buried in their work. The hospital is quiet and very orderly and solemn.</p>
<p>As for the lives of the students in the hospital, their daily life, getting up and resting are all on time. When they are sick, they are treated by the hospital doctor if they are mildly ill, and their families are notified to send them to the hospital if they are seriously ill. They usually have three meals a day, porridge in the morning, and rice for lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>The lower floor of the hospital building is the workshop classroom, and the upper floor is all their dormitory. After visiting around, the general situation is like this.</p>
<h3>Waiting for Business</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Coal Slag</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>In the wilderness, in the outer circle of the city; among those who live in thatched sheds, the hot weather is too stagnant. When the sun presses down from the sky, people seem to fall into an iron furnace with a strangely high temperature, listening to the scorching of the heat wave.</p>
<p>At night, if the sky has a few gusts of wind, great! People are like pupae after the awakening of insects, crawling out of the door one by one, scattered like meteors in the expanded wilderness, on the road, with sewage flowing by the pool.</p>
<p>That's when it's lively.</p>
<p>Liu Rong,——an old resident who has lived near the corner of the alley for more than ten years. He lives like this, supporting a family of four.</p>
<p>Every evening, they start most of their work. He himself sorts out the old things he picked up during the day; Mother Rong sews and mends needlework. Let Axi, Little Jinzi roll in the garbage dump to pick up the coal blocks they picked up next to the factory.</p>
<p>The adults always tighten their brows and devote all their energy to work, keeping silent.</p>
<p>Only the two children, because the coal blocks were not picked evenly, quarreled with each other, often stomping their feet and jumping wildly, scolding: grabbing a handful of rotten coal slag and throwing it over. "Wow! Little devil..."</p>
<p>The little one cried, but Axi was frightened by his dark face, like a guilty criminal, standing silently in the corner of the house like a Buddha.</p>
<p>"Don't cry! He's not good,...uh! Let me beat him!... "Dad loves everyone, will he really whip Axi?</p>
<p>Fortunately, these two children are willing to obey, and after a while, they forget everything and become affectionate again.</p>
<p>"Little Jinzi! Where are we going tomorrow?... The place today! Too bad, I'm afraid there won't be any more..."</p>
<p>"...Then still go to the rails! This side..."</p>
<p>Little Jinzi rolled his flexible eyes, indicating that he still had to consider:</p>
<p>"No! Someone interferes here..."</p>
<p>"Is it good next to the flour mill?"</p>
<p>"Tch! There's only coal slag there! What do you pick it up for?"</p>
<p>"Coal slag..." Axi hated this thing the most in his mind, and he also cursed it fiercely.</p>
<p>The night deepened, the sound was quiet, the two little children had worked hard all day, and at the moment they were a little hazy, it was time to go to sleep!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I have to leave the house earlier than my father, ready to find coal blocks.</p>
<p>One day, two days... the heat wave tightly pressed people, still as before. However, the big factories are precisely because it is summer; the shutdowns are shut down, and those who are unable to maintain are closed down. The whistle of the factory building is not as close and loud as before. It is difficult to be disturbed by a few sounds in the morning. However, the coal blocks are decreasing day by day, and even coal slag cannot be touched by people's feet everywhere.</p>
<p>Axi and Little Jinzi were anxious. The stable income of five or six hundred coins a day has now been discounted, and for a few days, even a day's search does not get a return.</p>
<p>It is also difficult for Liu Rong to rely on himself to cross the river to find work every day. Recently, he also wanted to avoid it for a while in the middle of the day because of the summer heat, but the whip of life was knocking on him invisibly, how could he not be afraid?</p>
<p>"What to do, there are no coal blocks lately! You..."</p>
<p>That night, Liu Rong came back and put a shallow basket in the corner of the wall, he sighed. Mother Rong looked sad, stepped back and fell on the bamboo couch without opening her mouth.</p>
<p>Axi's small face was swollen, and the right face was larger than the other side.</p>
<p>"Dad! Today Little Jinzi went to the coal pile stack, and while no one was there, he... he held a piece.... I knew someone rushed out halfway, he... he grabbed me and beat me... I took three slaps from him, my brother is agile... he didn't..." Axi complained, holding his swollen face:</p>
<p>"You...! You have to be honest! Don't do this... be brave,"</p>
<p>"Dad! Tomorrow we are going to pick up coal slag, there are coal chips in the coal slag, which can be sold to people to start a fire,... but, the price is not high!"</p>
<p>"That's good too!"</p>
<p>Liu Rong couldn't help but let two drops of water fall to the dry, crusty skin. His throat was choked, and his voice was low and not loud, like he had a bad cold...</p>
<p>In the thatched shed, everything else was as quiet as if it were surprised. All there was was the miserable sigh of their family of four.</p>
