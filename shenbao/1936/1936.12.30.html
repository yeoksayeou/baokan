<h3>百靈廟慰勞歸來（上）</h3>
<p>— 亮東</p>
<p>百靈廟的收復是我們民族復興的起點，所以對於這次攻克百靈廟的英勇將士們，我們早有前往慰勞致敬，並視察廟方形勢的心念。</p>
<p>綏省當局不僅對於戰爭準備很充足，就是對於各地到綏遠來慰勞的代表也是招待得備極周到的。我們此次從歸綏動身赴百靈廟是十二月十二日的下午，省府已預備好兩輛軍用汽車，並派兩位代表，沿途招待，那些慰勞團都十二分的感激，心想自己是來慰勞將士的，不該這樣麻煩政府。同行的有晋察綏人民代表，平，津，西安學生代表等，還有一位紐約報記者，兩輛敞蓬車裝着四十多人，又都穿着皮衣，皮帽，「氈疙疸」（卽是氈棉鞋），誰都擁腫得可以，擠在一塊，每個人都充滿了勝利的喜悅。出發時向城北駛去，我們都歌聲歡騰的唱喊起來，情緒是那樣激動。</p>
<p>開出二十多里，車子就在大靑山麓爬行了，經過壩口鎭西面的大黑河後，車身就在山澗的蛋石裏跳起舞來，我們早知道蜈蚣場是一個險要的山口，懸崖絕谷，道路崎嶇，眞不相信能通汽車。這時車裏誰都不愛說話了，都把眼睜得紅紅地望着，冰天凍地的寒冷一步緊一步，車子又隨時有翻身的可能，因此半數都嘔吐暈眩起來。</p>
<p>到武川縣是晚六時，我們經過四十多里的山中險道，再四十多里的荒地，到縣城要緊下來活動活動了。雖然滿身滿面灰土足足有半寸多厚，但誰亦不在乎。我們承由縣府招待，住在第一小學，把行李搬進去之後，要緊出來打聽一下最近由大廟子勝利歸來的士兵了。（我們到武川的晚上，正是大廟子攻克的那天。）在一個狹隘的酒店裏，天已經黑了，院子裏響動着許多軍用車汽缸的噴噴聲，屋子裏許多英勇的士兵，在那兒吃喝談論，步槍機關槍掛滿在牆上，有的一股腦兒躺在坑上睡着，顯然是前錢作戰勞苦歸來的樣子。我們和他們談論攻下大廟子的情形，他們說：敵人的軍器雖然好，但是沒中用，他們投過來的炸彈，一種能使我們流眼淚，一種能使我們打噴嚏，但是它們的效力只在二十米達之內有用，可是咱們的手溜彈能拋三十米達，所以還沒有把我們眼睛流淚的時侯，他們就已經沒用了。」言下，他們不勝其興高彩烈的神態。</p>
<p>他們又吿訴我們，酒店的院子裏停着的軍用車大部分是剛拉回來的勝利品，於是他們提着燈照給我們看，一個汽車後面用繩索拖着一輛很大的裝甲車，樣子很新，草黃色的鐵包皮，還有一個銅質的標誌，有臉盆那末大，圖案記號做得很好，但看不出什麽意思，敵人敗退時把裏面一兩樣機伴毀了，不過據司機兵說，化一百多塊錢就修好了。司機兵還給我們談敵機投彈時把他車身炸傷的情形，他們衝鋒時什麽都不管，除非車子不能動了，才下來散開，繼續衝鋒。那時他提着的燈光，從下面反射到他臉上，酷寒的氣溫迫着他嘴裏的水汽，吹到領子上便變成霜似的冰塊，我們都被他那種忠勇殺敵，堅毅奮發的情緒所激動！</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>印度民族解放運動</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>二年多沒有發表政治言論的甘地。最近突在番士坡（Faizpur）全印國民大會所主持的村鎭工業展覽會中演說。略謂「請君指示余應遵循的道路。余已準備重行入獄。並受絞刑。如君等能依余而行。則英國印度總督必將自認其錯誤。而自願與其他英人等。乘下班輪船同返英國。」這演說實表明甘地將重作政治的活動。</p>
<p>在早期的印度民族獨立運動中。甘地的地位是非常重要的。但這幾年來。印度獨立運動的領導地位。却已經轉到尼赫魯（Nehru）的身上了。甘地之所以失却領導的地位。是因爲他的政見不爲大多數的印度民衆所支持。甘地主張用消極的方法去驅除英帝國的統治勢力。以達到民族獨立的目的。所謂消極的方法就是不合作不抵抗民事的不服從（Civil　disobediance）以及拒納捐稅等。這種消極方法多年應用的結果。並不能使英國政府作很大的讓步。因此大多數的民眾就要求採取更進一步的積極方法了。民族社會主義者的尼赫魯就是這一派的領袖。他主張印度的工業化與現代化。贊成採取武力的抵抗政策。對於一九三五年英政府代爲製定的印度憲法。反對尤烈因爲他們所要求的是印度民族的完全獨立。而印度憲法雖規定印度聯邦與各省政府有若干的自治權。但國防外交等重要國權仍操在英國所派的印度總督的手中。對於一切革命運動。總督尤有隨意鎭壓的特權。因此在上半年的全印大會中。尼赫魯就說這憲法是奴隸的枷鎖。非打破不可。在本月二十八日的全印大會中。也一致通過反對這憲法的决議。由於尼赫魯的主張之深得大多數民衆的熱烈擁護。於是過去甘地的領導地位就轉到尼赫魯的身上去了。</p>
<p>但是現在甘地又突然打破二年來的沉默。而重作政治的活動。這於印度民族運動的前途有什麽影響呢。據記者觀察。這是很可樂觀的現象。因爲印度現在還有許多人信仰甘地。而他也仍然很努力於民族解放的運動。尤其是這幾年來。因爲印度民族獨立運動的長足發展。已使甘地思想受到很大的影饗。不久以前甘地曾對美聯社的記者說。「印度愛我。相信我。所以我覺得一生的使命還未終了。我仍然熱望印度能獲得自由。從外人的統治中解放出來。」只要甘地能接受羣衆的要求。尼赫魯派是會在他的領導下向民族獨立的大道邁進的。因爲印度的民衆已深知要達到完全解放的目的。祗有建立統一的民族鬥爭陣線。印人辛夫博士（Dr．Anup　Singh）在十月號亞細亞月刋上論印度的民族運動一文的結論中說。「印度的政治空氣表明甘地不久將被邀請再度領導人民向前邁進。而尼赫魯則願愉快地伴着同行。」我們希望印度的民族解放運動。能早日走上這條統一的戰線。因爲祗有這樣。印度民族才能獲得完全的解放。這不但印度的民族獨立運動如此。就是其他各國的民族解放運動。也都應該這樣。</p>

<h3>旅歐隨筆（四）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者　列山</p>
<p>從此以後，在德國不只德猶兩種人通婚不可能；就是他們間的戀愛，也要受法律的制裁·除了公認爲「辱及種族」以外，這兩個當事人，還要坐兩三年的牢獄·關於這種案件，幾乎每月總可以在德報上發見幾次。</p>
<p>爲什麽國社黨人這麽堅决排斥猶太人呢？猶太種人不准任德國的公務人員，這是我們能够了解的。但是連私人間的戀愛都要受到干涉？有的人說，從前希特勒先生在維也納時代，曾受了猶太人的刺激。雖然這不能算是主要的原因，歷來猶太人在德國就是不爲一般人所歡迎，不只德國在歐洲其餘各國也是如此。</p>
<p>猶太人在德國的被歧視，第一，因爲他們是異族。其次，猶太人善於經商。祖父還是一個販牛販羊的掮客，父親已是一個鋪子老板，到了兒子便是一個商人或大實業家，這是很常見的例子。（我們只要記起上海猶太富商哈同的一生）道自然要引起德人的反感，特別是歐戰以後，波蘭·俄國·各地的猶太人，成羣結隊移殖到德國來。他們不但向德農民作高利貸的放欵，另一面更乘德國馬克跌價之際，盡量投機·經過相常時候，原來破衣敗絮的掮客，一變就爲股實富戶。猶太人招忌的根本原因，就在這一點上面，於是希特勒登台一呼。大家羣起響應，造成了此日這種局面，許多德國人雖明知這種反猶太政策過於不近人情，可是在目前這種空氣中又有誰敢有另外的主張。</p>
<p>記得有一次同一位國社黨負責猶太問題的某君談及這個問題·他問，中國有沒有猶太人？我說：「中國雖有一些猶太人，但還沒有到成爲一個問題的程度。恰因爲這種緣故，我們不容易了解貴國的反猶太政策，假如我們可以向我們的讀者解釋：「猶太人同咱們的某隣國人一樣，」那末，大家會立刻明瞭到底是怎麽一回事。但猶太人是一個沒有國家的民族，幷且爲什麽所有的猶太人都是「劣種」，這一點：…」</p>
<p>他說：「猶太人到處爲家，沒有國家的觀念，今天可以做德國人，明天又會變成法國人或英國人，只要對於他個人有利……·」他的理論，我們是時常聽到的，不過全部猶太人都是壞蛋而沒有例外，一個人只要他的身上會有一部分猶太血液，不管是父親方面，或者母親方面，甚至於父親的雙親，有一猶太種便要被歸入「劣種」中去，這種邏輯，似乎不是我們所能够了解。目前一個德國公民的前提他要有淸白的祖上，父系與母系兩方一直追溯到一八〇〇年，在那時候沒有混人猶太血液才行。</p>
<p>十三·再論猶太問題</p>
<p>當希特勒執政以後實行排猶政策，一般人曾替希特勒担心，理由目前世界上的金融機關，并國際貿易，幾乎全部操於猶太人手中。假如各國的猶太人聯合起來對德施行經濟制裁，那末，德國財政非立刻陷於窘境不可。雖然，據記者所知，年來德國對外貿易雖受排猶政策的影響，但猶太人的種族覺悟同我們的預料相差殊遠。</p>
<p>例如對德通商，許多外國的猶太商人，特別是英國與捷克的猶太商人，年來始終是第三帝國工業品的良好主顧，甚至於他們親來德國採購貨物，個人利益的所在，什麼種族問題都可以拋在腦後，道是道地猶太式商人的典型。另一方面，各國的猶太人所以不敢積極援助德國的猶太人，原因恐怕將「排猶問題」擴大，會影響到自己的地位。在猶太人看來，單一德國排猶，事情還好辦，假如一旦連英·美·法。各國也發生了猶太問題。那末，他們的將來就不堪設想。</p>
<p>厭惡猶太人，幾乎各國人都有同感。記得從前在學校時代，只要有一位同學被人家四做「猶太」，那末在他看來比用別的字句去駡他要難受得多。在歐洲各國，普通一個猶太人，是享受不到平等的待遇的，除非他有了特別的才能或者金錢。反對猶太人的空氣，從紐倫堡德國排猶最厲害的地方）起到巴力期坦止，有猶太人存在的地方就有排猶的種子。</p>
<p>解決猶太問題的理想辦法，也許讓他們自己成立一個國家。這樣一來，根本可以省掉許多是非。其次，就是猶太人自己應該改了變生的方法，別只在金錢上做工夫，致引起當地國人民的反感。雖然猶太人幷不是人人都是資本家？但目前世界上大部分富翁却是猶太人，特別在許多大小城市中掌握經濟勢力的大牛又是猶太人。有的人說，只要猶太人少經營一部分工商業，猶太問題就可以解决了一半。</p>
<p>自從德國發生一排猶太人會向題以後，一部分猶太人會向南美洲·巴力斯坦·蘇俄·各地移殖。聽說中間也有一部分跑到中國來，我們中國人固然不談種族問題，不過希望這批人士別忘記了自己所以不能够在德國立足的原因，雖說他們在受了一部分同種人的連累。</p>

<h3>少婦及姘夫被控　誣吿印捕强姦　內容不實不盡異常穢褻　案情尚須調查明日續審</h3>
<p>住居滬西勞勃生路一千三百四十號門牌之南京少婦徐寳氏、年廿一歲、及其姘夫徐州人徐金惠、前晚因有向新閘捕房誣吿三五六號三道頭印捕强奸嫌疑、被西探長鮑台·華探目丁華國·等調査屬實、予以扣押、昨晨、解送第一特院刑八庭、工部局依照刑法一六九條誣吿罪、</p>
<p>提起公訴</p>
<p>、即據捕房律師張天蔭起而陳述案情、謂昨夜九時許、被告徐寳氏·徐金惠·二人、偕一四四一號華捕、同投新閘捕房報吿、據徐等稱、彼住居勞勃生路、頃間八時半、彼倆因欲赴石路購買圍巾、乃步行出外、行經卡德路黃家沙花園、徐寳氏忽覺內急、因黃家沙花園一帶居民晞少、且</p>
<p>燈光黑暗</p>
<p>、故氏即入弄中小便、不料其時突有印人三名、將氏拖入十四號空屋中、內有一印人將氏强奸云云、捕房核供、卽將徐竇氏送往醫院騐明被奸屬實、惟並無强奸情事、未幾、氏卽指出三五六號印捕卽爲强奸之人、捕房當向三五六號印捕査詢、據稱昨夜八時許、彼在愛文義路梅白格路口上差時、忽有徐金惠向彼</p>
<p>兜攬生意</p>
<p>、謂有年輕貌美之中國女子（指徐竇氏）要否、該捕答要的、惟現在上差時間、迨其落差後再談、至八時半、該印捕落差、乃偕往黃家庫花園十四號歡叙、言明每小時計法幣一元、因十四號本係空屋、由司閽印捕四十五號暫居於二層樓上、中途見四十五號司開捕與五二一號印捕</p>
<p>正在談話</p>
<p>、遂由三五六號印捕向四十五號言明、欲借彼之臥室、作爲臨時陽台、經允許遂一同前去、三五六號印捕卽與徐竇氏發生關係、越二十分鐘事畢、該捕卽給氏單角鎳幣五枚云云、捕房當在徐金惠身畔抄出鎳幣半元、及後忽有几十五號印捕向捕房稱、彼日前亦曾與徐氏</p>
<p>發生關係</p>
<p>、地點在順德路一〇三號三義旅社二號房間、捕房卽往該旅社吊到循環簿見本月八號二號房聞、係紅阿三所開、且有茶役劉慶連尙能指認、氏確與該捕同往奸宿、又有七零五號·一三零號、兩印捕亦向捕房報稱、前由徐金惠代氏拉客、在愛文義路中華新旅社二十四號房間、與氏同宿、故按照</p>
<p>以上情形</p>
<p>實無强奸情事、而兩被吿意圖他人受刑事處分、向捕房誣吿、應請訊究、又據三五六號印捕供明、係由徐金惠之介紹、與徐寳氏性交、當時言明每小時一元、後因祇有二十分鐘、故給其半元、且前於本年九月間、亦曾在十四號與氏</p>
<p>性交一次</p>
<p>繼據四十五號司閣印捕及三義旅社茶役劉慶連證明該氏與印捕奸宿情形詰之徐竇氏、仍稱昨夜因內急在黃家庫花園小便、被三印人拖入十四號樓上、一人將其强押、事後强將鎳幣半元塞入我袋中、由我轉交與丈夫、餘均否認、黃日升推事以本案尙須調査、乃諭兩被吿押候改期本月三十一號再訊</p>

<h3>上海霓紅燈製造業　中國徵信所主編　上海工商業概況之四十一</h3>
<p>一·緒言近世商業競爭，日趨劇烈。凡工商各界，無不以新奇之廣吿，競相號召，吸引顧客。年來廣吿術之進步，出陳推新，誠有一日千里之概。霓虹燈之發明，可謂廣吿術中一極大之發展。今世界各大都市，幾已無處無此媚紫輕藍之裝置。此不特爲商店之廣吿工具，且更爲都市夜景之點綴品矣，美人名此曰「夜神之眼波」，其動人之深，殆可想見。</p>
<p>霓虹燈英語作Neon　Light，最初係德國醫藥界所發明，初名「紫光」Vio，作爲治療疾病之用，與太陽燈等同爲治病之電療器具。其後有法人某，加以改造，用爲廣告工具，蓋以其發光艷美，且不觸目，見者莫不稱羨。唯其專利權，已售與美人K．Wm．Cloude，故又名Colud　Neon　Luminous　Tubing，有謂係美人Cloude所發明，此殆專利之誤也。然荷蘭人亦稱爲該國人所發明，至今凡荷蘭本國及屬地內，不許他國商人製造經營。故關於發明人一點，至今仍人各一辭，無從證實。惟以意度之，當以前者較爲可信。</p>
<p>霓虹燈光化學上稱之曰「氖」或「氝」，我國譯名除諧音之「年紅」，「熱紅」外，尙名之曰「氝光」。目前以「霓虹」一名，較爲普遍。</p>
<p>二·沿革</p>
<p>本埠之有霓虹燈裝置者，實以南京路四川路口之Royel金筆廣吿爲其嚆矢，時‘約在民國十七年間。惟是時製作尙未臻完善，時有沙沙之聲發出，而滬上人士已無不詫爲奇觀矣！經過彼處，輒翹首瞻仰。嗣有意大利人某君，在滬設廠製造，但以資力有限，範圍狹小，更因成本昂貴，售價無法低廉，以致營業不振，不久卽歸消滅。民國十八年，有美人RE．Lunkley等集資美金二十萬元，在滬開設麗安電器有限公司Cloude　Neon　Lights，Fed．aInc．U．S．A，設廠址於倍開爾路八十九號。因其出品精良，且是時適値滬市經濟繁榮之秋，一般較大之外籍商家，競相裝置，霓虹燈在本市，遂大放光明。然國人此時裝置者仍不多見也。</p>
<p>稍後又有某外人與匯人萬后紀，沈靈方等發起組織新光霓紅公司，前財决張壽鏞之公子張華聯君發起組織美登霓虹公司，周家聲，蔡國民，易經福三君組織紫光電氣廣吿製造廠，滬上同業始漸增加。然以各該廠資本較小，範圍不大，本埠中國商家，願作高價裝此廣吿者，仍屬有限，故發展較爲困難。惟當時固已呈欣欣向榮之概，此可謂本市霓虹燈製造業之初創時期。</p>
<p>民十九年夏季，工程界巨子張惠康，任士剛，陳俊武，羅慶蕃等，集資六萬元，開設東方年紅公司，初設廠於實山路商務印書館隔壁，除製造霓虹燈外，且能自製玻璃管。此爲國人自營之最大者，雖資本與麗安相較，尙覺瞠乎其後，然其營業之發展，實足與麗安相抗爭也。同年更有新開之華德燈泡廠，福來勝燈泡廠等，亦兼製霓虹燈。稍後更有通明，大上海，大東，大同，麗華，光明等廠，相繼開設，此時全滬之同業，總數不下四十餘家，此可謂該業之昌盛時代。（未完）</p>
<h3>小販與巡捕為難　捕房提起公訴　依妨害公務罪之條文起訴　巡捕開槍認為正當之自衛</h3>
<p>老閘捕房因鑒於南京路山西路一帶、每日上午水菓小販羣集、有礙交通、故於前日上午、飭派華捕二百九十號王世榮前往驅逐、該捕奉命後、卽時趕往、令各販將擔遷去、各販均各遵命而去、祇有一水菓販江陰人黃福根、抗不遵命、且口出惡言、對捕辱駡、捕卽擬將黃帶人捕房、詎黃竟</p>
<p>將捕拖住</p>
<p>用拳毆打、時該處附近之小販、聞聲園集者甚衆、悉對捕不利拳足交加、而黃其時更拾得大石一塊、擬擲捕之頭部、幸有拉包車之左來、在旁瞥見、上前將石奪下、乃黃心猶不甘、突趨捕前、將捕佩帶手槍之皮帶執住、圖奪其槍、捕爲自衛計、卽將槍取出、因此時</p>
<p>人多手雜</p>
<p>誤觸槍機、兩彈奪管而出、中黃之右腿及路人李錫生尤小傳子之左腿、羣集之小販、見已肇禍、紛作鳥獸散、時南京路山西路口中和銀行司閣捕三百十二號亦聞聲趕至、帮同二百九十號捕將黃及在塲之甬人陳芳林拘獲、並將傷者車送仁濟醫院醫治、而</p>

<h3>「市民國貨年」的回顧</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>在飛一般地時間的消逝過程中，又很快地結束了我們的「市民國貨年」。</p>
<p>現在，是已到臨了歲末年尾，我們對於本年來的國貨運動，也正是應該加以檢討，加以淸算的時候，我們知道，檢討是十分重要的，它能够指出過去的缺點，也能够顯示已往的優點，而使我們能够重新確定未來的計劃，繼續前進。</p>
<p>這一年來的國貨運動，顯然是在很艱苦的奮鬥中進行，因爲有着我們許多企業家和熱心從事國貨運動者不斷努力，到底也使整個國貨的發展，有了很長足的進步，尤其是出口的略增，入超的减少，一般廠商營業總額的增多，國外貿易的好轉，這種可喜的趨勢，現在都已從事實上來得到證明。</p>
<p>至於具體的事實，——在本年中我們國貨進展的成績，那末我們首先可舉出，像今夏南洋考察團的組織，前往南洋各地的實地考察，宣揚和推銷，它使國產在海外的市塲上，開拓了相當的基礎，像家庭訪問工作的舉行，這是表示推銷國貨益趨實際和積極，而最値得一提的，那當然是全國國貨聯營公司的籌辦，這一個全國有計劃有組織的產銷機關的成立，它不僅是顯示我們國貨界進取的精神，和政府維護國產的决心，並且更反映出了我們前程遠大的有希望的國貨前途。</p>
<p>雖然，國貨運動在這一年來，仍有很多的阻碍，最大的像走私猖獗，洋貨傾銷的依然猛烈，尙須我們更大的努力，特別是要消减大量舶來奢侈品的輸入，這是我們應該立刻做到的</p>
<p>「市民國貨年」已剩了最後的幾天，我敢作最後五分鐘的呼籲，願大家不僅要向本年有留戀，苦笑和怒吼的熱情，同時，更應該及早為前程遠大的明年而努力！</p>
<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>服用國貨領域的普遍</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近上海市國貨運動聯合會委託陸禮華女士赴皖贛鄂湘四省調査並推進國貨運動，陸女士費二十餘日之時間，奔走四省之重要都市，與地方黨政機關及當地婦女界接洽均承各地同志熱烈贊成，紛紛組織服用國貨會或提倡國貨運動會。據陸女士觀察各地國貨運動，可謂普遍發達，主持者亦均努力不懈，惟可憾者：</p>
<p>（一）當局未能助以全力。</p>
<p>（二）經費困難，旣定計畫，不易實現。</p>
<p>（三）一部分工作，未見切實。</p>
<p>（四）各地國貨運動，組織互異，名稱混淆，不能聯絡一致，作擴大的運動工作。</p>
<p>就陸女士觀感所及，認爲提倡國貨，應有四個步驟。</p>
<p>（一）調査當地國貨出產及消費情形。</p>
<p>（二）促進國貨出品之切實改進。</p>
<p>（三）使人民養成鑒別國貨與非國貨之能方。</p>
<p>（四）普遍力行國貨同時應統一名稱及組織，全國設最高機關，以董其成。省市縣及鄕區各設分支會，如此系統分明，組織統一權力一貫，可收指臂之效，每年規定活動計畫，按步實施。</p>
<p>各地服用國貨領域的普遍，是民國二十五年極好的氣象。在此一年結束之時，尤値得欣慰無已。記者認爲今後國貨之發展與前途之進步，實無限量。前日李祖虞先生以所譯日本國貨運動之進程一文示予，吾人覺得東隣在十餘年前，與我人今日所域的情形，如出一轍。彼邦以政府之全力贊助，國人之一致服用，加以檢査工作之認眞，技術人才之努力，以及社會各方之互相策勵，始有今日自給自足不待外求之境况。我國今日上下一心，以服用國貨挽回利權爲鵠的，不必十年，成績當有可觀。陸女士之所陳，更可次第實現。爰於一年之終，粗述大凡，並寄以無限之希望也。</p>
<h3>別矣！「市民國貨年」</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>光陰荏苒！市民國貨年，已賸最後的兩天了！筆者曾於其來臨之初，著詞歡迎，今於其去也，不無依戀！市民國貨年的成績，雖不能予吾人以滿意的印象，然而國展會也，國貨女訪問也，其所以推進國貨運動，與日俱增，抱遺憾的，祗不過少數麻木不仁的奸商和嗜用洋貨的洋奴！而大多數對於「國貨」兩字，確有較深的認識！觀於中國國貨公司顧客的肩摩轂擊而益信。明年聞將定名「公務員國貨年」那麼公務員最高領袖實業部長領導的推進「國貨聯營公司」事業，必有絢爛偉大之成功！回念過去，瞻望未來，「市民國貨年」雖去，而吾人服用國貨之責任，正方興而未艾也。</p>
<h3>購買過年物品應作如是想</h3>
<p>— 惟際</p>
<p>新年快將到臨，大家又忙着採購禮物選辦貨品了！可是正當國貨努力提倡聲中，我們一般國民應在選購貨品之前，應作如是想：</p>
<p>……所要買來送人的禮物，倘是洋貨，被送者不將要說我不識貨不愛國嗎？</p>
<p>買了洋貨，不是替國家增加一筆漏巵；買了國貨，不是替國家增加一份生產？</p>
<p>送洋貨給人，人家要引以爲憾，送國貨給人人家却恭然歡迎。新年喜氣揚揚，禮物當然使人家歡迎爲要！</p>
<p>其實許多同樣物品，愛好外國貨是心理作用而已；國貨要比它好得多呢！那我何樂而不採購！</p>
<p>國貨重實際，洋貨重外式，自家吃的用的，不求外式，只需實際。</p>
<p>努力購買國貨是我們每個國民應盡的義務。</p>
<p>提倡國貨，當以身作則，由己推人；我買了國貨，人家也隨我買國貨，國貨自能盛行！</p>
<p>挾着國貨携回家中，男女老幼，不論吃用穿服，俱是國貨。眞是國貨滿堂，其樂也融融</p>
<p>實則以上諸點，平時大家都能够想得到的；不過在此正忙着採購新年禮品過年貨物的時候，我特爲提醒大家請牢牢的重溫一下罷了！</p>
<h3>反省和最後努力</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>光陰過得真快，眨眨眼號稱「市民國貨年」的本年，又消逝得祇賸一個月的時間了，對於過去這多的時候，我們似乎應該加以檢討一下，國貨運動的成績如何？國人對於國貨的努力，究已達到若何的程度？這不能說是沒有意義的舉動吧？我們在報章和國貨刋物上，所獲得的解答，固然已經比較往昔進步了，因爲接觸我們眼簾的國貨消息，什麼國貨考察，國貨訪問，舉行國貨展覽，創設國貨市塲等等，連續不斷的刋載着，而且由全國各省，市，縣，以及擴展到國外南洋，星加坡等處，都有國貨新聞的傳播，所以照表面上看來，這不能說不是特有的好現象，可是在另一方面去觀察，却又令人生疑？看到每月終國際貿易局的報吿，對於各種洋貨入超的數字，總是很足驚人！有時更增出上屆的數目，何况奢侈品，化妝品，玩具等，這類不務實際的東西，常佔着此中的巨額，由此可知全國民衆，仍未全體購用國貨，這是最顯著的事實。至於過去的幾個××國貨年，却從淹忽中消遊，苦乏多大貢獻，很覺抱着遺憾！而這市民國貨年又祇剩餘短短數十天，我們應該最後加緊努力，做出一點成績來，爲國貨界先樹立良好基礎，藉作來年進行國貨運動的先導，總期兢兢業業，始終一貫，必須達到全國民衆服用國貨的志願才好。</p>
<h3>輕而易舉的勸用國貨法</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>談到提倡國貨問題，一方面固然要希望一般的國貨工廠，對於貨物的品質方面，要加以適當的改良，而達到堅固耐用美觀地步。同時，更須勸導一般平素愛用洋貨的同胞，一反其已往的習慣，轉變他的觀念，大家站在一條戰綫上，共同爲國貨而努力。這樣雙管齊進，而後才能收到提倡國貨的大效，這是誰都不能否認的一個道理。</p>
<p>關於第一問題，我相信：目前的一般國貨工廠，大家已在着手進行，自然是一種可喜的現象，這裏可不必多談了。至於勸導一般平素愛用洋貨的立反其已往的習慣，而與洋貨離婚，和國貨發生戀愛，這倒是一個値得討論的問題。</p>
<p>記者最近曾去拜謁一位國貨界的老前輩天虛我生陳蝶仙先生，和他談談勸用國貨問題，陳先生却提出一個極好的方法來，我認爲大有公開介紹，公開發表的價値。</p>
<p>陳先生說：『我每天收到一般人的來信，平均總在十餘封左右，有的要我指導生計，有的要我指導研究小工業，有的要我指導學術上的進修，我對於每位寫信給我的同志，總是盡我所知去吿訴他，希望他能够得到一個辦法，不過，有許多來信，却每每用着洋信封和洋信紙，我以爲大有勸導的必要。因此，特地刻了一枚圖章，上書「奉勸勿用洋貨」六字，遇到這種來信，除了就信答覆之外，並在信末蓋上一章，表示我的勸導的意思。此法實行以後，現在倒很少收到這種信件了！或許這便是我的勸導的結果。……』我聽了他老人家的話，覺得很有至理，同時，我更想：這個輕而易舉的勸用國貨法，我們也大可效法，希望讀者諸君大家注意注意，如果以後收到這種信件，我們何不也來模仿一下陳先生的辦法呢？</p>
<p>莫小視這「奉勸勿用洋貨」的一枚小圖章，要知道這和一般人提倡國貨的心理建設，着實有很重大的關係哩！</p>
<h3>再談大學生與國貨</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>在前幾期的木刊裏，好像刊過一篇關於大學生用國貨的文章，作者沉痛地指出目前的大學生只貪着物質文明而實際上却爲洋貨而推銷着，不過這事實或許偶然發生在近都市的大學，而多數大學，像北大，浙大，中大，金大，生活還算檢樸的，作者自已以及和好許多遠遠近近在大學讀書的朋友信裏，差不多都感覺到大學生活，並不像中學時候所想像的奢侈，而尤其在內地，我們往往找到四五個同志合租的一個後閣，自己泡水，自己補衣服，空了還要替人家做些工作的苦學生，這不能不算是一些可喜的事實。</p>
<p>不過，大學生差不多在敎育界裏負有重大意義的人，提倡國貨的工作，間接和直接都有很大關係，現在就二點來講。</p>
<p>（一）間接方面；大學生應該對於國貨事業，存着貢獻的願望。當一個人在唸書的時代，差不多對他的終身工作已定了基石，什麼是我們終身的工作呢？自然，這是基於個人興趣，萬不能勉强的。不過在可能之內，對於與國貨有關係的科門，宜特別注意，例如唸商業學的人，對每年外貨輸出的統計，及新土業的財政管理等，學工科的人，對於國貨工廠設備的改良以及外國工廠的設施等問題，先抱着熱心去研究，這對於未來做事也許有極大帮助的。</p>
<p>（二）直接方面，第一，實行國貨必須從自己做去，不可饒恕自己買一件已知有國貨品而仍舊用洋貨的事，社會上有好許多人不滿意大學生的空吶喊，其實有時候，往往確實有這些矛盾的事發生，這是很可恥的，第二，要喚起一般文化落後的羣衆來用國貨，北方的靑年，最近半年來做了許多實際工作，提倡國貨，也是工作之一，據說成效很好，本刊時常刋着怎樣宣傳國貨的文章，多很切實的，要做，那麽就立刻去做不要等待明天了。</p>
<p>大學生爲什麽被人家懷疑是洋貨的推銷者呢？爲什麼被人家譏諷多了一個大學生就是國家多了一筆漏巵呢？大學裏自然有不少公子哥兒每天穿着最時式的服裝像比賽似的，自然也有淘醉在物質享受裏遇着浪漫生活的，不過，不要忽略有大多數前進的大學生，他們是愛用民族工業的用品，他們是絕不願隨波逐流的！</p>
<p>我們要進一步，聯合大多數的同志，向最有利於國貨的途徑，大步，邁進！</p>
<h3>「洋貨」與「私貨」</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>—都是破壞我國經濟的唯一大仇敵—</p>
<p>提起了「洋貨」誰都知道，是足以亡國的一樣東西！至於「洋貨」之爲物，爲什麼會致一個國家於覆亡？說來也誰都已經知道的了。爲的是大凡購買「洋貨，」無異是「太阿倒持。」換句通俗的話說，便是送錢給外國人，製造了槍砲武器，好向我國侵略啊！不但如此，並且「洋貨」愈買得多，錢的輸出也愈多。國計民生，便一天天窮困起來。終有這麽一天，不待侵略也足以自趨滅亡！這正如一個人的血液一樣，要是任令流之不已，終有一天流盡，終有一天「嗚呼哀哉！」</p>
<p>至於「私貨」呢？這是今年這個「市民國貨年」裏，所發生的一件最嚴重至不幸的事情！也可以說是今年這個「市民國貨年」裏，所發現的一樣較「洋貨」更可怕的東西！因爲，它一方面可以使一個國家的稅收短少，甚而至於完全斷絕！一方面可以摧殘一個國家的「國貨，」甚而至於可以使之完全消滅！因此，它可以使一個國家的經濟崩潰得更快！更不堪設想了！</p>
<p>唉！這樣看來，「洋貨」與「私貨，」都足以亡我國，都是破壞我國經濟的唯一大仇敵！我們不可忽視，我們固然不可購買「洋貨，」更不可購買「私貨！」我們應該要趕快的本「國貨救國」之旨來維護「國貨！」我們應該要趕快的本「國貨救國」之旨來打倒「洋貨」與「私貨！」</p>
<h3>植物油的原料問題</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>我國自古燃燈，向用植物油類，如豆油，菜油等，後來自外國的石油輸入廉價傾銷以還，民間祇圖眼前享樂，不顧日後受罪，致使我國固有的油類植物，逐漸少種，而石油的輸入，也與年俱增，單就我們浙江五百多萬戶口計算，平均每戶每年用石油一箱，計全省外溢的金錢，就要二千多萬元，所以這亦是　　農村經濟崩潰　　因之一。如今幸而有人發明了一種用電氣壓力的植物油燈，同時「中國植物油料廠」，也應運而生了。該廠是由湖南，湖北，江西，浙江諸省的建設廳聯合組織。近日正在籌備一切，大約在今年植物油產品上市以前，就可正式成立了。但是我以爲此項植物油燈將來推廣後，植物油的生產，供不敷求，則油價勢必上漲，仍難與石油競爭，所以現在植物油料廠，第一步應該先勸吿農民多種油類的植物，像烏桕，山茶，蕓苔，花生等等，這其中最容易播種，而成效最著者，當推蕓苔。（一名苔芥，俗呼油菜，其子榨油，卽菜油）。因爲蕓苔是種於冬季，無妨稻作，而收穫又很豐富。據通常每畝田能收子一百斤，這百斤菜子，可以榨油三十斤，每份農家，統扯能種蕓苔一畝，已足供全年的需要。此事有關國計民生，深望有力者，能登高一呼，庶幾萬山響應，亦緊縮國民經濟，杜塞漏巵之一得也。</p>
<h3>一週間國貨新訊</h3>
<p>上海市民國貨年運動委員會，建議定明年爲公務員國貨年。</p>
<p>上海市國貨運動聯合會，請陸禮華女士赴安徽江西湖北湖南推進各地服用國貨運動，業已返滬，向該會正式報吿。</p>
<p>國貨聯合營業公司，定一月一日開始招股，正式成立籌備處。</p>
<p>國貨界前組南洋商業考察團，發起組織圖南會。</p>

<h3>證券　公債交割一千八百餘萬</h3>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所、爲辦理十二月期貨交割之期、交割總數、有一千八百七十六萬五千元、內除各經紀人自行劃帳者、計一千二百九十六萬五千元、在交易所交割者、僅五百八十萬元、與上月比蛟、漸有增加、收貨者均以金融界爲勇、交貨者則係散戶居多、自十月二十八日開始上塲後、因時正値多空相角逐之期、故市况過程極趨平穩、市價曾作長久之盤旋、惟因有多頭公司組織之傳說而各大戶均奮勇收買、趨勢由醞釀而緩步上漲、直至十一月二十八日、因人氣之堅昂、多頭復起狂抬、市價一致再向高峯邁進、但爲價格過昂、實貨已漸見流出、至十二月十日某金融大戶、又以無限制巨額拋售、致市况漸呈疲萎、十四日因環境驟起劇烈變動、西安發生變化、人氣頓呈恐怖、市價竟暴跌四元停板、而爲散戶急於斬結、時盤中復降一二元、後幸賴政府維持有方、銀行界均起招扶、始告風平浪靜、市價均轉回漲、甚爲迅速、至二十五日、因蔣委座安然脫險、市乃靑雲直上、成交總數、計二萬四千二百六十萬五千元　茲將其交割劃帳成交總額、列表如左、（單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食　期麥多頭稍有脫手　市價隨洋麥一同回落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致平靜、因洋麥報價、前日會好六七角、昨則芝加哥近跌一元四角零、遠跌三四角、坎拿大跌二角零、故開價後人心平定、交易亦少、因粉市已停、年底又將結賬、所以爭競甚少、迨至下午開盤、初尚平穩、繼以業外多頭、各月份均有脫手、市氣轉軟、計回跌一二三分、現麥市面、日來見交甚清、特高貨開過六元七角半、次六角六七分、祇幾百包交易云、</p>
<p>雜糧交易所各月份拍至昨日爲止、定明年一月五日、照常開拍云、</p>
<h3>麺粉交割祇二千包</h3>
<p>粉交亦改定明年五日開市</p>
<p>十二月份之麵粉交割、依然寂寞、祇無錫九豐廠有緣山鹿二千包交割、由本街收去、餘則一無所聞、至交易所市塲、本定明年一月四日開市、早經公布市塲，茲聞雜糧定五日開拍、故亦須延遲一日、亦定五日照常拍做云、</p>
<h3>客秈成交一萬三千包　薄稻白粳續漲一二角</h3>
<p>（客秈）昨市轉形活潑、到貨仍有長江各埠裝來、產地以粵銷停頓、頗有轉運來申求售者、但粵商以湘省直接辦裝、反嫌手續麻煩、更有種種檢騐留難、昨日又在滬市採辦漢糙二千包、北洋有機紅機元去化、汕頭鄭州均有續辦、而本街鄉莊復有暢辦、市面頓形活潑、全日開出贛米六千多包、湘米五百六十一包、漢繾二千包、　甬嘉興各米四千二百包、總計成交一萬二三千包、交易旣旺、價亦跳起五六分至角外云、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源略稀、共到六十餘號、貨共一萬二千四五百石、內中薄稻有四十餘號、本街銷塲雖稱不弱、然包胃平庸、平津靑烟等帮祇辦薄稻四五千包、是以薄稻行情轉定、無上落、厚粳以貨稀提起一角、杜洋尖亦帶緊、陰元亦好近角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到船無幾、僅二十六七號、白粳去路、早市囤戶及零銷續動、午市轉懈、市價又漲一二角、薄稻店銷頗活、價昂二角外、早稻跟漲角許、白元胃納動化、價加二角三四分、羊杜埠客等秈價加一角、陰元價亦加緊角外、常帮特別白粳昨市未開、</p>
<h3>黃豆銷塲激增</h3>
<p>雜糧市塲、前日因慶祝蔣委員長而休市、故昨日市塲中交易熱鬧、黃豆銷塲有榨油廠及內地榨油坊動辦、成交數激增、計開四平街豆十二三車、蚌埠豆四車、鄭城豆三車、邳州豆五百包、　莊豆一車、其他乍豆成交一千餘包、遲豆四百包、丁家州豆百餘包、行情比上週六漲起六七分至一角不等、總之、大連豆市漲多跌少、交易所標凖行情、因之挺俏、一般販運商、志在套賣、所以外間現貨籌碼减縮、市面不易有小面、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷組白昨到萬餘包</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢穩秀、公會划盤、、二四粗砂白現貨二十一元六角、轉口貨六元二角二分、九號荷赤KD嘜又升五分、為十六元一角、東白四八九號及本廠綿白均無上落、號盤有廣帮開出祝青三百餘包、十二元、建帮開出刁靑二百餘包、十二元八角、潮帮開出黃崗青數十包、聞汕頭昨電、因蔣已返京、人心安定、各帮辦　復起、產價再升二角、荷粗白昨由芝尼加拿輪入口運到一萬零三百六十包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　川木耳續向上展　南芡銷路較好故回漲</h3>
<p>四川木耳號盤一百十五元、已開過數十連、但昨市復趨緊俏、又四漲五元、須一百二十元、方肯續開、同時漢口產價亦升三四元、較高者一百元至九十八元、此聞頂上小包航空牌四售一百十五元、以次照減、趨勢頗覺挺秀、</p>
<p>南塘芡　、邇來除與化帮時有採辦外、餘如本街內地亦有需要、故售價較前又增、高貨售五十二元、池芡市勢仍平、篩莊售十八九元、普通十六七元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　美莊絲電來滬頗多</h3>
<p>昨日橫濱絲市稍回、標準絲現期貨跌七元至十元不等、而紐的却步前日橫濱後塵、交所及易持價、均騰漲頗勁、計日絲八三分漲九分、七五勻度漲一角、上海絲及廣東絲各漲九分、交易所標凖絲十二月份漲五分、五月份漲四分半、里昂僅日絲漲半法郞、其餘絲品均售原價、昨日美莊來電頗多、唯因申市人心過堅、致成交不巨、白廠七八勻度售盤、有漲過七八零元之趨勢、內銷B字咸售開七六零元、四川白廠昨亦有相當走銷、行盤堅穩、不亞江浙白廠昨共成交一八八包</p>
<h3>五金　雙連美鐵大漲不已</h3>
<p>近日馬口鐵已見轉機、蓋海外連電報漲、本埠積存寥寥、因恐明春貨價大漲、故竭力設法收辦、上漲不已、尤以雙連美鐵爲最、共升騰達六七元之多、刻市如雙連（九十磅）美鐵沽四十四元、意貨四十一元、德貨四十元、至於雙連（一百磅）美貨沽五十元、意貨沽四十四元、德貨四十二元、此外英法諸貨因斷檔故無市、聞昨市交易、共開出六百除箱、聞由囤戶及廠家辦、</p>
<h3>特載　祁紅之產銷製　（二續）</h3>
<p>祁紅茶以運銷國外爲主，故全部箱茶，均運滬售與洋行；銷於店裝者，實屬甚少。本節所言，祁紅茶價，卽指上海市價而言。據財政部國定稅則委員會出版之上海貨價季刊及月刊，祁紅市價，係憑每月十五日上海躉售市價記載，茲錄近十二年來上等祁門紅茶之每日躉售價格如左：（單位爲元，指數以民國十五年市價作爲一〇〇）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （太玄）</p>
<p>歲云暮矣。案頭上的民國二十五年日曆，從着厚逾數寸揭到了最末的一，二頁，「一年容易又春風。」大好的年華，一瞥眼就過去了。</p>
<p>我們不必爲着春花秋月來惆悵，我們也不必爲着馬齒徒增而感慨，我們試檢舉自己在這一個年頭里所作的工作和生活，若者是增加了它辦事上的效率，若者是增加了它學業和知識上的精進，對於落難的國家，是否有了相當的認識，盡了最大挽救的努力。如果有了相當滿意的答復，那末，這一個年頭，就算沒有白過了。同時，還要檢舉着自己個人的生活上，有沒有增加了不良嗜好，和不良習慣，用「有則改之，無則加勉。」來警惕着自己。</p>
<p>民國二十五年眼看忽忽逝去了，二十六年緊接着登塲了，書桌上的案頭日曆，人們都預備棄舊迎新重行安置了起來，在民國二十六年日　元旦第一頁起頭：我們希望個人的生活，集團的生活，國家的生活，同新年一樣有新的氣象。但是，想到國際間的環境，想到被塵迫的國家，自然需要我們整個的民族，各作更大的努力！</p>
<h3>舞塲裏的紳士與戰塲上的將士</h3>
<p>— 逸雲</p>
<p>身上所穿的：</p>
<p>紳士—新式西裝，彈簧皮鞋；都是外洋定來的。</p>
<p>戰士—絲綿馬甲，國布軍服；全是後方捐助的。</p>
<p>嘴裏所吃的：</p>
<p>紳士—香檳，名烟，留蘭香，咖啡。</p>
<p>戰士—黃沙，細泥，西北風，雪片。</p>
<p>耳朵所聞的：</p>
<p>紳士—皇家樂隊，伴奏着舞藝的名曲。</p>
<p>戰士—槍聲砲聲，和着傷兵的慘呼聲。</p>
<p>眼睛所見的：</p>
<p>紳士—一對對男女的擁抱，和窈窕舞女的巧笑。</p>
<p>戰士—一隊隊軍人的衝鋒，和殘暴敵人的屠殺。</p>
<p>鼻子所聞的：</p>
<p>紳士—糖香，酒香，舞女身上的香水香。</p>
<p>戰士—烟火，炸藥，傷兵創口的血腥氣。</p>
<p>口裏所嚷的：</p>
<p>紳士—好妹妹，來吧！給我一個甜蜜的　Kiss吧！</p>
<p>戰士—弟兄們，殺呀！一點點的創傷怕什麼呀！</p>
<p>呀，舞塲上的紳士仍是多麼的快樂啊！他們在那燦爛的燈光下，油滑的地板上，緊緊地摟着，舞着，那兒還想得到那些在雨似的槍彈下，寸厚的凍泳上，拼命衝鋒的戰士們呢！</p>
<p>諸位讀者們！我們看了上面的此較後，閉起了眼睛，細細的想一想，到底是那一個的榮耀</p>
<h3>春子</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>春子姑娘，是我在這二個月中，所新認識的某咖啡座的一位女侍。伊是中中人，本來的名字，並不四做春子，因爲在三個月前，投身於該咖啡座，而由老闆給代取的芳名。</p>
<p>我的所以注意到道位春子姑娘，還是因着伊的未曾褪盡的方音，啟示着和我或許是有同鄉關係的。一經訊問，才知她的老家，和我的老家，却只隔得三十里，而且得知若伊的出身，竟是个書詩門第。</p>
<p>伊今年是二十五歲，但對不相識者，總說是二十二歲。因着伊的軀體的嬌小，說二十二歲，己是　夠的了。據說，是在十七歲上，便離開家庭的。那時，伊是負　而在上海求學，由於愛情的誘惑，不惜的和守舊的家庭，鬧翻了臉，而給嚴厲的父親，驅逐了出來？因爲母親是繼母，哥哥是一個紈袴子，二個姊姊，都已是出嫁多年的了，平日的感情，也是十分淡漠的，所以在那時，脫離家庭，卻倒是毫無留戀</p>
<p>接着，便和愛人結婚了。結婚之後，才知他是　暴得不堪同居的，在家庭中，極難找得一絲二絲愉快的空氣。過了十六個月，生了一個孩子，不上一月，便夭折了，於是夫婦生活，是更苦了，每天，只是鬧成一片。終於在結婚之後的第十九個月裏，在一位律師的事務所裏，無條件的解除了相互的痛苦的束縛。</p>
<p>那時，懷着一顆創痛着的心，悄極與悲觀，是佔有了伊的生活的全部。要想繼續求學，而獲得相當的生活技能吧，精神與經濟，都感着不足，於是投進了歌舞團，混進了電影圈，更曾託身於若干跳舞塲籌，中间，曾二度的离開上海，而往漢口，青島等地，謀生。在漢口，并會一度的在工廠中作活。一二八時，還曾一度的由義務看護，而謀以看護爲業。但是，光阴是飛快的溜過去了五六年了，還是沒曾找得一個立足點，所以在三月之前，爲飢寒所迫，而無可奈何地，暫求生活於不可久居的咖啡座中，待谋发展。</p>
<p>某一次我问伊将来是否要以结婚爲最後的歸宿，伊苦笑着搖搖頭，伊說「我在這東飄西泊的五六年中，已不知看到過若干男子了，也不知已有若干男子，向我追求過了。但是人之一生，就不過是這麼混混就算了，結婚，雖可解决麵包問題，可是精神上的痛苦，是很厲害的。這一點我是認識清楚了」</p>
<p>上星期日，我上那咖啡座時，伊告訴我說，伊的後母死了，伊的父親招伊回家去。但伊還沒有決定。昨天，我陪着朋女，又上那咖啡座時，據伊的同伴說，伊又接着父親的信，辭職而於前晚回鄉去了。——我於是爲伊祈禱着，祝福這個無家可歸的小烏，從新投進家庭的懷抱裏，恢復伊的原有的幸福，而療治着她在這七八年來，所受的深刻的創傷。光明，照耀在伊的芷待邁進的路途上。</p>
<h3>蠟梅</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>昔范石湖著梅譜，計近百種，顧一花有用三名者爲多，實不過半數耳，其花早開者，問有立冬前已吐蕊，然在羅浮庾嶺，以地氣溫暖也，故前人有「十月先開嶺上梅」之句，若吳下，西湖，會稽，四明，各地，雖多百年老榦，其枝　曲萬狀，清蔭周遭，下可羅坐數十人，騷人逸士，往往載酒賞之，而非至冬盡春來，亦未易著花也。</p>
<p>至蠟梅雖名梅，而實匪梅，因共與梅同放，且芬芳之性亦與之相近，其色一如蜜蠟，遂稱之「蠟梅」云爾，或謂開花恒在臘月故亦名「臘梅，」其說不一。考共樹之種類，係落棄灌木，葉爲長卵形，而且對生與真正之梅不類，亦橫斜　瘦外之異葩也。花有磬口，荷花，及狗英，三種，而磬口爲尤責，瓣圓，色黃，形似白梅，雖盛放，而常如半含，若折一枝，供諸膽瓶，香可盈室，經月不散，故世俗每與天竹相配，列之應事，以爲冬時不可少之清品也。</p>
<p>余家後有隙池，其他卉木，俱已荒蕪殆盡，唯此蠟梅獨存，蓋猶先君子所手植焉，計其時，將近百年矣，故老　縱橫，非僅兩三，而枯枝亦大如壯夫之臂，不可以把，近歲不加芟伐，益覺　繪可觀，兼以冬時若行春令，而枝頭顆顆，胥作金黃色，其香四濫，較之去歲，開花愈早洵異數也。俗云，「過冬至後，三戌爲臘，」今非共時，故余志之，亦足微氣侯之漸變己</p>
<h3>記猩猩血</h3>
<p>— 張皇</p>
<p>猩猩血是紅顏料中的最上品；因爲那是從活猩猩身上取出的，所以其色特別鮮艷，其價自也不賤。人們怎樣取得狸猩血，講來還有趣。</p>
<p>獵戶們携帶着滿　佳釀和一切應用之物出發，停留在猩猩羣日常必由的路旁伺候着。等到猩猩們將近前來之際，疾忙開　注酒在幾隻大盌裏，排列在路上，把大扇子用力扇着，使那酒氣四溢，獵戶們便退到路旁隱蔽處偷瞧着。狸猩們出行，必是成羣結隊的，它們身無寸縷，卻最喜歡穿木屐，行步時發出　　之聲，以爲像人類一般的多麼氣概！這麼着恰是授人以隙。</p>
<p>猩猩的愛酒似出天性，童叟無欺，要是今朝有酒，定然不醉無歸！它們驟然聞得酒氣，正中下懷，一律拖步趨前，果然見到那路上一盌盌的，綠油油的東西，大家不禁歡躍四囂起來。不過其中總有年老些的，對道無功之祿不免懷疑，或者殷　不遠，前事未忘，會得正要舉盞，突然縮手，好像有一個慘劇的幻象正映在它們睫前的光景。它們便驅開那班小猩猩們，一邊它們口發啁啾之聲，似在相戒母犯。道麼的略爲勾留之後，這一羣居然相率離去。</p>
<p>走不多遠，此中慚多頻頻掉首，繼而駐足踟跚，終於全羣遄返。總要經過三轉四回頭的來往，它們委實遏制不住那撲鼻芬芳的誘惑力，就此開始各呷少許，聊解饞吻。一定的，它們既已開戒，難道還肯罷手不成？於是盌中之酒一鬨而光，直到　中不剩餘瀝纔歇，它們也都飲得氣力全無，橫七豎八地醉倒在路旁了！</p>
<p>獵戶們便在這時躍出，一個個高舉白刃，裝作來勢汹汹，像要結果它們性命的模樣。它們無法逃生，祇有發出哀求的聲息。一個獵戶先向一隻猩猩戳上一刀，取器受盛其血，指點給衆猩猩看。它們便能會意，各自指給你們認明其身上可以取血之處下刀。它們並會演着手勢表明它們各自可以供給的血量，以不致喪生爲度，任憑你們擰取。</p>
<p>不是麼？「投吾以旨酒，報之以腥血」。便宜是食得的麼？嗜好可以不克制淨絕麼？我們但瞧這猩猩血的來源！</p>

<p>第九回　杯水盟心青燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>這個疑團還不曾打破，次日上午，友梅又來了。今天穿的是學校裏白竹布制服，還夾了一個白布書包，簡直是個上學的樣子。他也來得熟了，進了大門，口裏喊着表哥，這直的就走到了書房來。國器看到，要伸手去取衣鈞上的長衣時，友梅橫了兩雙手臂，將他攔住，笑道：表哥，你若是這樣，就見外了。我是天天來的人，像一家人一樣，何必這樣客氣，你不看我，就是穿了隨便的衣服來的。並不以爲到這裏來是客。國器道：我也不算把李小姐當客。若把李小姐當客道屋子裏就招待不週了。友梅似乎也覺得客氣話太多了，是近於無聊的，便把那書包放在桌上，帶了笑容透開來，笑道：我在書箱裏一找，大大小小就是這樣一包，至於那些可以作材料，那些是廢物，我不知道，請你自己挑選罷。國器聽他說，果然帶了許多太平天國的史料來了，很是高興，也忘了避嫌了。立刻搶上前把那些稿件拿起來細看。其實不用細看，只遠遠的看了那紙的頗色，就當失望了。原來那全是全紅或桃紅的八行信箋，上面所寫的楷字，無非是恭賀年節的一些老套話，雖然，那年月都是咸豐同治年間的，但只是清廷的小官，向上憲去的請安信件，並沒有一個字，提到和太平天國打仗的事，共間縱然有些掃平賊氛的話，也不是史料。接連看了一二十件，都是如此。友梅當他在看這些文件時，並不說什磨。自己站在旁邊，靜悄悄的拿一柄扇子在手上招看，雖然，他是爲他自已扇風取凉的，然而那扇子所扇出來的風，一般的向國器身上送來。國器始而在看信件，還不知道。後來偶然停頓一下，卻明白了。不過心裏雖然十分感激他，可不便明說出來，於是向他笑道：東西太多了，我一時看不清楚。友梅已忘了神，還是自己扇着扇子，又帶向國器扇着，笑道：不要緊。这些文稿，舍下也沒有人翻弄過一回，就放在你這里罷。什么時候不看了，什么时候还我好了。我這東西不是我私人的。若是我私人的，　送　哥哥了。（　十）</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>歲暮即景</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>—南京路上的一個橫剖面</p>
<p>大都會的動脈，向著跑馬廳那邊伸展出去，跳動得非常厲害；緊張的人潮是像脈絡里的血液一樣地在奔流。廣告牌上的霓虹光，在空中織奏着紅綠的交流錢，四大百貨公司尖頂兒，靜靜地在那西北風中聳立着，那冬季大减價的旗幟卻密密地掛滿在兩傍商店的門前，無綫電的播音機在奏送着年夜的進行曲，使一般人都驚谔着一惆悠長的歲月，又悄悄地在憂息的生活背後爬過去了。</p>
<p>南京路，道東方巴黎的商业總樞纽，它永遠是這樣繁榮的，這樣美丽的。每天，從清早到深夜，不論是冬天或夏天，它總不會掩沒這副活潑熱鬧的姿熊像蟻羣般的行人，像蟻羣般的車輛，由東往西。由西往東，紅綠的交通燈是忙碌地換着顏色，每一刻鐘都不會停息，都不會寗静的。</p>
<p>從外灘起，沙遜大廈雄視着滾滾的黃浦江而，到江西路口，便有幾支列強的吸血管架在那里，管口正對準着都市的血脈，對準着每一惆國人的毛孔，在吸收著大量的血，這經濟侵略的力量，並不亞於大砲。</p>
<p>拋球塲到新世界爲止，那是南京路上最緊張的一個塲面；這里，那些商店的大玻璃櫥窗里，陳列着各種珍奇美麗的貨品，穿的有大綢緞局，大皮貨店，吃的有大食品公司，大補品商店，用的有大木器公司，大百貨市塲；總之，這兒有最現代式的，各種各樣的東西，只要你口俊里不缺少法幣，那末你要什麼都可以跟你跑的，要是袋里「空空如也」的話，我想還是快點走開的好，省得看着眼癢。</p>
<p>每一個角落里，在蠕動着一條一條約影子，他們儘是忙碌着，像在幹着行麼秘密勾当。有些商店，公司，遊藝塲，跳舞廳，食品店，正在趕緊佈置新年的點缀，幾家南貨店的門前，並且還裝上了許多刺眼的電炬，顧客確實給它吸引得相當的鬧熱，他們都一大扎一大捆地挾着那些紙包從里面走出來，臉上全浮著一絲滿意的微笑。</p>
<p>在日昇樓的那一段里，那人行道邊上，鵠立着一排一排拍賣貞操的神女，伊們爲了生活，便不能和一般人－樣，享受那年夜的悠閑清福，照舊，每天要在深夜的街頭，站在那凜冽的西北風中，等待着一個人來滿足伊們的生活，同時，伊也情願讓他滿足一回性慾；這樣雙方在一个賣買交易的條件之下，大家都滿足了。</p>
<p>深夜里，江海關上的洪亮鐘聲，飄進都市的每一個角落里的時候，那罪惡的，繫榮的，商業總樞紐的南京路，也像一條冬眠的巨蛇一樣，靜悄悄地在那里躺着了。可是它，到了來朝依然會一樣活躍的。</p>

<h3>地產事業的慘落</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>一個靠薪俸過日子的，他的支出部分，可說是三分之一，有時甚至二分之一，要用在「住」的問題上。所謂「寸金之地」，在上海的確是言不虛傳了！</p>
<p>關於地產的投機事業，近年來可說是跟經濟各部門一樣，也入於不景氣的一途了。最近地產業公會具呈上海市政府，瀝陳地價慘落，請令土地局重估地價，减輕稅額，其呈文中有云：「竊滬地年來因商業凋零，市面枯竭，地價之跌，一落千丈，故商業中之感受痛苦最深者，莫如地產一業，潮流所趨，因此而傾家蕩產者，時有所聞……」這種地價慘落的狀况，因此而引起地產業者的破產慘情，我們不可否認的是事實的逼眞的供狀，在民族危機日趨深化的今日，這種現象，原是不足爲怪的普遍現象呵！</p>
<p>有地皮的旣是那麼「感受痛苦」，並且說是感受最深者，那麽沒有地皮的，特別是普通的棒給階級者，他們的「感受痛苦」當然是更加來得大上千百倍了！自一二八以來，特別是近一二年來，上海的弄堂房子，一般的二房東，過去有的曾靠着一幢房子專門分租與人，而居然也可以渡過日子的，到現在想來，都是過去的黃金之夢了。二房東在目下都是怨聲載道，關於房客（普通都是二房東）與業主之間的糾紛，可說是此伏彼起，無有已時。比較中心一帶的地段，我們雖然還看不出二房東的恐慌之情，然而次於中心地帶的，每條弄堂口，方方正正的紅紙「召租」，正如爛膏藥一般，貼滿兩壁，而細細欣賞召租的文字，似乎也很「進步」了，大都富有藝術的「感誘性」，似乎廣告的「文學化」，在「召租」上也可以嗅到它的氣息了。二房東尚且如此，「三房東」當然是「一蟹不如一蟹」了！</p>
<p>地產業者的苦况，確是事實，而房客的悲慘的情形，更加是不可諱飾的實事，在這民族危機深化的今日，實在指示不出我們應走的一條道路！</p>
<h3>由「援綏音樂會」想起來的話</h3>
<p>— 因非</p>
<p>「一切藝術都是宣傳」。這句話我們聽得很熟了。這句話是非常之對的。</p>
<p>有人把「藝術」這兩個字看成爲高不可攀的東西；也有人把藝術看成爲養情悅性的玩意兒，例如電影中有所謂「軟性論」者，他們便是以爲電影是祗配作「眼睛吃的冰淇淋，心靈坐的沙發椅」用的。</p>
<p>但「藝術」究竟是什麼呢？「藝術」兩個字，看起來確乎是神聖得高不可攀似的，就卽使是高不可攀吧，但牠却沒法不和人間發生關係，一和人間發生關係，在客觀上，牠就不能沒有作用了。何况這中間還有「藝術家」的主觀，而「藝術家」又和俗人一樣，同樣的要吃飯睡覺，不能凌空而行。</p>
<p>綏遠事伴發生之後，對於援助前錢的守士將士，我們毫不誇張的說，是可以用「舉國興起」四個字來形容的，在「舉國興起」中，我們如果再調査一下捐欵者的職業和年齡，那是更會被感動得淚下的；然而，在這方面，藝術界——我們再把範圍擴大些，稱爲文化界吧——是盡了多少力呢？說起來，文化界照理應該是民眾們的前導。</p>
<p>旁的地方如何我不知道，在上海，據我所看到的，則是藝術界的人士比其他民衆落後，牠不僅沒做到前導地位，很可笑的，還給民衆們的熱情帶着走。</p>
<p>從綏遠事件以來，到目前爲止，我們來計算一下看，爲鼓吹民族自衛而戰的展覽或是其他的集會有沒有呢？慘得很，有是有過幾個的，例如幾個專門在廣播電台播音的歌唱團體聯合播音，零零碎碎的什麼攝影展覽會提成援綏等等，都是。能够在「本位」上設法募捐幾個錢來援助守土將士，這熱心自然是値得嘉許的，但是，如此就算是盡了責嗎，從事藝術的朋友們？</p>
<p>基於「一切藝術都是宣傳」的認識，在物質上的援助之外，我們是還該有更多的精神上的援助的，而精神上的援助，不但是直接的給予前綫的守土將士們的，更重要的，還在於如何鼓起後方民衆熱烈的愛國的情緒，如何指示引導民衆們到全民一致的抗敵路上去，民族自衛的戰爭，是祇有動員全民族人員，才能有勝利的把握的。</p>
<p>最近，上海的音樂界有一個援綏音樂會的舉行，這自然是一件好事，看節目單呢，上面也有「中華民族不會亡」「自由神之歌」「誰說我們年紀小」「旗正飄飄」等歌唱，（但也有「玫瑰三願」等歌）就在內容上也可說是盡了音樂界的職責了。以「本位」上的技能，賣錢來援綏，這是國民的天職；而藝術界的人士，以他的職責來貢獻給民族，貢獻給社會，這也是「本位」上的天職。如果以靡靡之音來媚惑聽衆，乘機換得幾個錢，捐助給前錢守土將士，在國民的天職上，自然算是盡了，但在本位的天職上，他却是個罪人！這個罪並且是不能和盡了國民天職的本份相抵的。原因，就在</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>於盡國民天職原是本份，而用靡靡之音麻醉民衆却是罪惡呀！</p>
<p>而現在，爲了「國民的天職」而忘了「本位的天職」的，却似乎很不少！</p>
<p>上海音樂界援綏音樂會，那自然是比較兩者兼顧的，但爲了盡本位的天職起見，我希望能够更深入更普遍的做去，在有時，本位的天職是比國民的天職更重要的。</p>
<p>自然，這不僅是單單希望音樂界如此，更不僅是希望上海的音樂界如此。</p>
<p>一個文化工作者如果不能比一般的民衆在愛國上更多做一些事情，那是愧對「文化」這兩個字的！</p>
<h3>楊柳</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>在植物中，我最愛楊柳。花鏡分楊柳爲二條，柳云：「柳一名官柳，一名垂柳，本性柔脆，北土長，多枝條長軟，葉靑而長，初春生柔荑，粗如筋，長寸許，開黃花，鱗决荑上，甚細碎，以漸生葉，至暮春，葉長成花，中結細子，如粟米大，扁小而黑，上帶白絮如絨俗名柳絮，隨風飛舞，凡著毛衣，卽生蛀虫，入池沼，卽化浮萍，此乃官柳也。若叢葉成陰，長條數尺，或至丈餘，嬝嬝下垂者，此爲垂柳，雖無香艷，而微風搖蕩，每爲黃鳥交語之鄉，吟蟬比息之所，人皆取以悅耳娛目，乃園林必需之木也。」楊云：「楊有二種，白楊葉芽時便有白毛，及盡展似梨葉，長而厚，面淡靑，而背白，蒂長，兩兩相對，遇風則簌簌有聲，人多植之墳墓間。高可十餘丈，又靑楊樹，較白楊小，葉似杏葉而稍長大，色靑綠，本亦聳直，大槪柳枝長脆，葉狹長，楊枝短，葉圓闊，柳性耐水，楊性宜旱，二木不相侔，何可因其並稱而遂認爲一木耶。</p>
<p>這裏是把楊柳兩種分得很淸楚，然而我所愛的一種，却是「叢葉成陰，長條數尺，或至丈餘，嬝嬝下垂」的「垂柳」。但是我到底是一個「俗人」，旣然不相信「柳絮」「入池沼卽化爲萍」的說法，並且跟着「垂柳」呌楊柳，而不加分別</p>
<p>劉庭芝公子行云：「可憐楊柳傷心樹，我讀時，有初見眼明之感，因爲這「傷心樹」三字，實在是楊柳的好諡法，眞是能攝楊柳之魂的名稱。我讀書不多，不知道把楊柳當作歡娛的植物的人，到底有否？但我的確沒有見過。</p>
<p>世說『桓公北征，經金城，見前爲琅琊時種柳皆已十圍。慨然曰：「木猶如此，人何以堪？」攀枝執條，泫然流淚，又『顧悅與簡文同年，而髮蚤白，簡文曰；「卿何以先白？」對曰；「蒲柳之姿，望秋而落，松柏之質，經霜更茂。』。那末，桓宣武旣因爲柳已十圍，而有遲暮之感，卽知在植物中，柳也是「早落」的一種呢，比之松柏，能無戚慨</p>
<p>古人分別，往往折柳爲贈，所以湯玉茗的「紫釵記」的「折柳陽關」折中云；「李郞今日雖然壯行，難敎妾不悲怨，前面灞陵橋也，妾待折柳尊前，一寫陽關之思。」接着是一支北寄生草云：「怕奏陽關曲，生寒渭水，都是江干桃葉凌，波渡汀洲草碧黏雲漬，這河橋柳色迎風訴，（折柳介）柳啊！纖腰倩作綰人絲，可笑他自家飛絮渾難住。」陽關折柳的古典，自然是以王維的一首詩來的「渭城朝雨滬輕塵，客舍靑靑柳色新；勸君更盡一杯酒，西出陽關無故人。」據說當時官路旁的柳樹，住往長條折盡，只剩光禿的大枝。</p>
<p>南宋姜堯章以詞名天下，然而他的詞序，實在高出他的詞萬分；「合肥城內多種柳，秋風夕起，騷騷然。」這寥寥數語，已經刻劃出了荒城秋暮的情形，然而他只描寫了楊柳。</p>
<p>古今來關於楊柳的作品，實在太多了。但是我最歡喜的還是楊鳳苞的西湖秋柳。因爲他寄託遙深，不像王新城之秋柳四律，味同嚼蠟。現在抄兩首在此，作我這篇短文的收束。</p>
<p>「姻雨湖山翠黛愁，錦颿遙送下揚州；惜無陳范春風筆，點染南朝水墨秋　」</p>
<p>「萬頃堂深月正昏，新塘歌舞不堪論，謝家飛絮歸何處，賸有嬌黃照夜磨。」這兩首詩，實有亡國之感，則楊柳蕭蕭，又何異黍離麥秀也。</p>

<h3>National Government Orders Immediate Handling of the Xi'an Incident, Ceasing Military Action, Abolishing the Punitive Expedition Headquarters, Turning Zhang Xueliang Over to the Military Council for Punishment, and Ordering Strict Restraint of Troops</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued a clear order on the evening of the 29th, stating, "The Xi'an Incident has damaged the national order and shocked the entire nation. Looking back on it now, it is truly regrettable. Fortunately, the instigator immediately expressed his remorse and gradually repented.

<p>(Nanjing) The Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission recently submitted to the Central Executive Committee for instructions regarding Zhang Xueliang's arrival in the capital and surrender for punishment. The Central Executive Committee forwarded it to the Central Political Committee for discussion. The original submission is recorded below: "Respectfully submitted: The Xi'an Incident was entirely due to my, Chiang Kai-shek's, lack of guidance and supervision. I have already submitted a request to the committee (government) to be relieved of all my positions and severely punished to clarify my responsibility, which I trust will be duly noted. Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, acting as commander-in-chief, allowed such a major incident to occur within his jurisdiction. He cannot escape national law and military discipline. Now, the officer has personally come to the capital, surrendering himself for punishment. As his direct superior, I, Chiang Kai-shek, immediately received his written admission of his violation of discipline and disrespect upon arriving in the capital, and he is willing to receive the punishment he deserves. I, Chiang Kai-shek, believe that the officer, despite his inadequate command of troops, still knows to admit his guilt, demonstrating the strictness of our central laws and discipline. Therefore, the officer has shown respect for national law and expressed repentance by surrendering himself. I should record the officer's letter and submit it to the committee (government) for review and approval, and for consideration of the circumstances, handling according to the law, and granting leniency to encourage self-renewal. I await your instructions with reverence. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (Chairman Lin of the National Government). One copy of the original letter is included. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government."</p>
<p>Original text of Zhang Xueliang's letter to Chairman Chiang: "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, my dear sir: I, Xueliang, am reckless and crude by nature and have committed the great crime of violating discipline and disrespect. I now shamelessly follow the delegation to the capital, sincerely willing to accept your punishment and to be punished with the deserved punishment to uphold discipline and warn future generations. For the benefit of our country, I, Xueliang, will not hesitate to die ten thousand times. I beg you not to consider personal feelings or have any reservations. I am inarticulate and cannot fully express my intentions. I humbly ask for your understanding. Respectfully, I bow to your peace and well-being. Zhang Xueliang, respectfully, 26th."

The National Government, after receiving the report, also instructed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the afternoon of the 29th that no discussion was needed. The original order stated, "The report is noted. The Chairman is diligent in national affairs, both benevolent and brave, with outstanding achievements that are admired by all. The Xi'an Incident arose suddenly, and he was able to demonstrate a spirit of solemnity and a great personality. His sincerity moved the instigators to repent their past mistakes and surrender themselves for punishment. Furthermore, it further inspired the hearts of the nation's military and civilians to love the country, upholding discipline and bringing joy to the people. The request for severe punishment and removal from all positions should not be discussed. This order." (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

Resolution: Comrade Chiang has devoted himself to national affairs, supervising and educating the three armies, diligently working from dawn to dusk, and never resting. He twice entered Shaanxi recently, using the spirit of the Generalissimo's great benevolence and courage to educate his subordinates and unify military morale. The Xi'an Rebellion was an extraordinary event, and he was able to maintain a strong sense of righteousness and demonstrate a great personality during his ordeal, sincerely moving the insurgents to repent and confess. Comrade Chiang has no reason to take the blame for this incident. His request to resign should be earnestly rejected. The request for punishment should not be discussed (When voting on this motion, all the committee members present stood up and unanimously approved it). (3) Committee members Lin Sen and four others proposed that Comrade Shao Yuanchong, Director of the Central Party History Materials Compilation Committee, died in Xi'an, and the vacancy be filled by Comrade Zhang Ji.

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek submitted a report to the Central Standing Committee and the National Government, taking the blame and impeaching himself, and requesting to resign from his positions as President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. According to Chen Bulei, Director of the Second Office of the Chairman's Adjutant's Office, after hearing the Central Committee's resolution to earnestly retain him, Chairman Chiang still intends to persistently resign. Chairman Chiang places the utmost importance on discipline and responsibility. As the commander-in-chief, Chairman Chiang believes that he should be held responsible to the party, the country, and the people. He can no longer hold important public office. Moreover, Chairman Chiang has been extremely hardworking for the past year, and his recent physical condition requires a period of rest and recuperation. Therefore, he is determined to submit a second letter of resignation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, recently submitted a request for punishment, taking the blame for the Xi'an Incident, and requesting to be relieved of all his positions. The original report is as follows: "Respectfully submitted: I, Chiang Kai-shek, have been entrusted by the party and the country to oversee military affairs and administer the government. This time, I went to the west to inspect the troops, but unexpectedly, the Xi'an Incident occurred on December 12, causing worry to the central government and anxiety to the people. The national order was on the verge of collapse, shocking the world. Fortunately, the central government handled the crisis with decisiveness, and the incident was quickly brought to an end. However, the damage to discipline and order has been significant, and the military and civilians in Guanzhong have suffered great distress. I personally oversee military operations and am responsible for education, but my spirit failed to resonate, and my education was ineffective, leading to this act of lawlessness, which nearly shook the foundation of the country. Ultimately, I cannot escape the blame for ineffective leadership. I believe that the most important thing for the country to establish is discipline, and the implementation of rewards and punishments requires clear responsibility. Although the incident occurred suddenly, I failed to foresee the situation and prevent it in time, causing my subordinates to act unjustly, betraying the trust placed in me by the central government. According to the principle of punishment starting from the top, I cannot escape my responsibility. I urge the committee (government) to clearly hold me responsible and severely punish me for my negligence. I have been physically and mentally exhausted for the past year, and my negligence has caused many mistakes. I am no longer fit to hold important positions. After this incident, I feel deeply guilty and should no longer hold national titles. I request that I be relieved of my positions as President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and that a capable person be appointed to replace me so that I can retire and await punishment. This will demonstrate the strictness of national law and reduce my guilt. I sincerely plead and humbly ask for your approval, feeling extremely apprehensive and urgent. Respectfully submitted, Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang National Government."

<h3>Damage to Tongxi Section, Repairs Hastened</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to railway news, the track on the Longhai Tongxi section has been damaged. The railway bureau has sent personnel to repair it, and the Wei River Bridge has been repaired. However, the Lingkou Bridge is too severely damaged and will take time to repair, approximately three days before traffic can resume.

(Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The most severe damage to the Longhai Railway's western section is to the Wei River and Lingkou Bridges. Hong Guantao, director of the Tongxi Engineering Bureau of the railway, is supervising round-the-clock repairs. Qian Zongze has also dispatched Wu Shien and He Gonghua, the director and deputy director of the engineering department, to assist. A pontoon bridge made of sleepers is nearing completion on the Wei River. However, the Lingkou Bridge is difficult to repair due to the rapid water flow and the fact that it is a rigid beam without bridge piers. Qian has ordered that it be repaired and opened to traffic by the 3rd of next month. The Weinan station, which was bombed but not destroyed, is also being repaired. One green steel train originally stopped in Xi'an was also destroyed in the war, and many other trains were destroyed in Shaanxi. The railway's losses are enormous, including the suspension of freight and the sharp reduction in passenger transport, totaling approximately five million yuan. Employees in Shaanxi who were previously reported missing or killed have now reported for duty. Qian has also sent personnel to Xi'an to comfort the employees and provide assistance for resettlement and purchase of necessities. Currently, in addition to direct telegraph communications between Xuzhou and Shaanxi, mail still needs to be routed through another province, and passenger trains still only reach Tongguan.

<h3>Replacement of Heavy Rails on Hangzhou-Yushan Section of Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It has been found that the Hangzhou-Yushan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway uses light rails. The entire line is scheduled to be opened to traffic in June or July of next year, and the Qiantang River Bridge project will also be completed at the same time. If the Hangzhou-Yushan section is not replaced with heavy rails, it will be impossible to complete the direct through-traffic plan for the Hangzhou-Yushan, Yushan-Nanchang, and Nanchang-Pingxiang sections. From then on, it will be possible to operate direct express trains between Shanghai and Guangzhou. The Ministry of Railways is now cooperating with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council to purchase heavy rails from the Vítkovice Ironworks in Czechoslovakia for a price of 6 million yuan, to be paid off in three years. In addition to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Joint Company issuing promissory notes and the Ministry of Railways providing guarantees, there are no other guarantee procedures. In recent years, there have been several instances of foreign investment in Chinese railways, but this is said to be the first time for the Czech side. It is reported that this replacement of heavy rails will cover approximately 350 kilometers, and the entire project is expected to be completed by the end of June next year. At that time, Shanghai will be directly connected to Guangzhou. It is reported that the sleepers on the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang Railway are rotten and old, the roadbed is loose, and various projects have not been repaired for many years. In order to adapt to the interconnection of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Beijing-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Railways in the future, the Ministry of Railways has handed over the management of the line to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company and ordered it to manage it. The Ministry of Railways will also fund repairs to connect the southeastern transportation network and integrate it into one system. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Nationwide Wheat Moisture Content Tests</h3>

Therefore, the wheat moisture problem in Jiangsu and Anhui is quite serious. Currently, there are no wheat drying facilities in various parts of China. If farmers and vendors do not dry the wheat separately and gather it all in the market, the quantity will be too large to dry, and either the buyer or the seller will suffer significant losses.

<h3>Returning from慰問in Bailingmiao (Part 1)</h3>
<p>-- Liang Dong</p>
<p>The recovery of Bailingmiao is the starting point for our national revival, so we have long had the idea of ​​going to慰問and pay tribute to the heroic soldiers who conquered Bailingmiao this time, and to inspect the situation in Miaofang.</p>
<p>Not only is the Sui province authorities well prepared for war, but they are also extremely thoughtful in their reception of the delegates from all over the country who come to Suiyuan for慰問. Our trip from Gui绥to Bailingmiao this time was on the afternoon of December 12. The provincial government had prepared two military vehicles and sent two representatives to receive us along the way. Those慰問团were very grateful, thinking that they were here to慰問soldiers and should not bother the government like this. The people accompanying us included representatives from the people of Jin-Cha-Sui, student representatives from Ping, Tianjin, and Xi'an, etc., as well as a reporter from a New York newspaper. The two open-top cars were carrying more than 40 people, all wearing leather clothes, leather hats, and "毡疙瘩" (that is, felt cotton shoes). Everyone was so swollen that they could be squeezed together, and everyone was full of joy of victory. When we set off, we drove towards the north of the city, and we all sang and shouted happily, our emotions were so excited.</p>
<p>After driving more than 20 miles, the car crawled on the foothills of Daqing Mountain, and after passing the Dahei River west of Bakou Town, the car body danced in the egg stones in the mountain stream. We knew early on that Wugongchang was a dangerous mountain pass, with cliffs and valleys and rugged roads, and we really didn't believe that cars could pass through. At this time, no one in the car wanted to talk, and they all stared red-eyed, the cold of the icy sky was getting closer and closer, and the car was in danger of overturning at any time, so half of them vomited and fainted.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Wuchuan County at 6 pm, we had gone through more than 40 miles of dangerous mountain roads and more than 40 miles of wasteland, and we had to get out of the car and move around. Although there was half an inch of ash and dirt on our faces, no one cared. We were entertained by the county government and stayed in the first elementary school. After moving our luggage in, we had to go out and find out about the soldiers who had recently returned victoriously from Damaozi. (The night we arrived in Wuchuan was the day Damaozi was conquered.) In a narrow hotel, it was already dark, and the sound of many military vehicle cylinders was spraying in the yard. In the house, many heroic soldiers were eating, drinking and talking. Rifles and machine guns were hung all over the walls, and some were lying on the pit and sleeping. It was obvious that they had returned from the hard work of the front lines. We talked to them about the situation of capturing Damaozi. They said: Although the enemy's weapons are good, they are useless. The bombs they threw can make us cry, and some can make us sneeze, but their effectiveness is only within 20 meters. But our hand grenades can be thrown 30 meters, so before we have time to shed tears, they are already useless." In other words, they were very happy and excited.</p>
<p>They also told us that most of the military vehicles parked in the hotel yard were spoils of war that had just been brought back. So they held up the lights to show us. Behind one car, a very large armored vehicle was being dragged by ropes. It looked very new, with grass-yellow iron cladding, and a copper sign, as big as a washbasin. The pattern was well made, but we couldn't understand what it meant. When the enemy retreated, they destroyed one or two components inside, but according to the driver, it could be repaired for more than 100 yuan. The driver also told us about how the enemy planes bombed and injured his car body. They didn't care about anything when they charged, unless the car couldn't move, then they would get out and spread out, and continue to charge. At that time, the light he was holding reflected from below onto his face, and the extremely cold temperature forced the water vapor from his mouth to blow onto his collar and turn into frost-like ice. We were all excited by his loyalty, courage to kill the enemy, and perseverance!</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Indian National Liberation Movement</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Gandhi, who had not made any political statements for more than two years, recently spoke at the village and town industry exhibition held at the All-India National Congress in Faizpur. He stated, "Please tell me the path I should follow. I am ready to return to prison and face hanging. If you can follow me, the British Governor-General of India will surely recognize his mistake and willingly return to England with other Englishmen on the next departing ship." This speech clearly indicates that Gandhi will resume political activity.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the Indian national independence movement, Gandhi's position was very important. However, in recent years, the leadership of the Indian independence movement has shifted to Nehru. Gandhi lost his leadership position because his political views were not supported by the majority of the Indian people. Gandhi advocated using passive methods to expel the ruling forces of the British Empire to achieve national independence. These passive methods included non-cooperation, non-resistance, civil disobedience, and refusal to pay taxes. The result of applying these passive methods for many years did not force the British government to make significant concessions. Therefore, the majority of the people demanded more aggressive and active methods. Nehru, a national socialist, is the leader of this faction. He advocates for the industrialization and modernization of India and supports the adoption of a policy of armed resistance. He strongly opposes the Indian Constitution formulated by the British government in 1935 because they demanded the complete independence of the Indian nation. Although the Indian Constitution stipulated that the Indian Federation and the governments of various provinces had some autonomy, important national powers such as national defense and diplomacy were still in the hands of the British-appointed Governor-General of India. The Governor-General had the special power to suppress any revolutionary movement at will. Therefore, at the All-India Congress in the first half of the year, Nehru said that the constitution was the shackles of slaves and must be broken. At the All-India Congress on the 28th of this month, a resolution was also unanimously passed opposing this constitution. Because Nehru's proposals have been enthusiastically supported by the majority of the people, Gandhi's past leadership has shifted to Nehru.</p>
<p>However, now Gandhi has suddenly broken his two-year silence and resumed political activity. What impact will this have on the future of the Indian national movement? According to reporters' observations, this is a very optimistic phenomenon. Because there are still many people in India who believe in Gandhi, and he is still working hard for the national liberation movement. Especially in recent years, due to the great development of the Indian national independence movement, Gandhi's thoughts have been greatly influenced. Not long ago, Gandhi told a reporter from the Associated Press: "India loves me and believes in me, so I feel that the mission of my life is not over yet. I still yearn for India to gain freedom and be liberated from the rule of foreigners." As long as Gandhi can accept the demands of the masses, the Nehru faction will move towards national independence under his leadership. Because the Indian people already know that to achieve the goal of complete liberation, they must establish a unified national struggle front. Dr. Anup Singh said in the conclusion of an article on the Indian national movement in the October issue of Asia Magazine: "The political atmosphere in India shows that Gandhi will soon be invited to lead the people forward again, and Nehru will be happy to accompany him." We hope that the Indian national liberation movement can embark on this unified front as soon as possible. Because only in this way can the Indian nation achieve complete liberation. This is not only true for the Indian national independence movement, but also for the national liberation movements of other countries.</p>
<h3>Hitler Returns to Berlin to Discuss the Spanish Issue; Considers the Anglo-French Note as "Misdirected"; The German Government Will Temporarily Not Respond to It</h3>
<p>Munich Hitler has returned to Berlin and will consult with senior Nazi Party officials on important matters. The note from the British and French governments to the German government regarding Germans serving in the Spanish Nationalist Army will naturally also be on the agenda. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, officials commented on the notes sent by the British and French governments to Germany regarding non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, calling them "misdirected diplomatic documents." It is said that the German government had already made grand proposals regarding volunteer forces, but its efforts were unsuccessful due to disagreements between Soviet Russia and major factions in France. This loss is difficult to compensate for with untimely diplomatic actions. As for the questions raised in the Anglo-French notes, the German government does not seem likely to respond for the time being. Regarding the dispatch of volunteer forces, one spokesperson said that it was "not very simple." (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government, together with the French government, yesterday sent notes to Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia, advising them not to send any more volunteer soldiers to Spain to participate in the civil war, and requesting that each country make a decision quickly. So far, none of the four governments has submitted a response. Regarding Germany's attitude, well-informed sources here recently declared that Britain does not intend to grant economic benefits to Germany as a condition for it to accept the prohibition of volunteer soldiers from serving in Spain. Germany must guarantee that it will no longer continue to build up its military before Britain can consider making economic concessions. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible officials recently declared that France does not intend to grant economic preferential treatment to Germany as a condition for it to accept the advice. Such preferential treatment can only be considered later when negotiations are held on the overall European situation. However, if Germany can accept the notes proposed by Britain and France, negotiations on the overall European situation will inevitably be easier. Moreover, the notes from Britain and France were sent to Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia at the same time, and are therefore multi-lateral in nature.

<h3>The Spanish Government Releases Detained German Ship; Confiscates Cargo and Munitions; Germany Denies Sending Additional Warships</h3>
<p>Bilbao The Basque Autonomous Region government recently issued a public announcement stating that after the German merchant ship "Palos" was detained by government warships in the waters of this region, the warship "Königsberg" sent by the German government has now arrived in this port. The captain of the ship immediately requested the autonomous region government to immediately release the ship, its crew, passengers, and all cargo on board. The autonomous region government responded that it could do so except for the munitions carried on the ship, which would still be detained. However, the captain of the ship refused to concede. As of now, the two sides are still continuing negotiations. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Bilbao The local radio station recently broadcast a message stating that after the German merchant ship "Palos" was detained by Spanish government warships, the captain of the German warship "Königsberg" came to negotiate, and the ship has now been released under the conditions set by the Basque Autonomous Region government.

<p>(Berlin) Semi-official sources recently declared that after the German merchant ship "Palos" was detained in the waters of the Spanish Basque Autonomous Region, the captain of the German warship "Königsberg" went to negotiate, and the ship has been released by the Autonomous Region government. However, one Spaniard on board and part of the cargo are still being detained, so the matter has not been completely resolved. People in political circles said that the merchant ship "Palos" was detained on the high seas, and the Basque Autonomous Region authorities even sent personnel on board to arrest one Spaniard. This action is contrary to international law. The German government is currently considering "appropriate measures" to deal with the situation. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Madrid The government today decided to release the detained German ship "Palos" and three German sailors, but the authorities in Bilbao refused to hand over the ship because it was carrying contraband. (National News dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Officials have revealed that Germany hopes to resolve the detention of the "Palos" ship without resorting to force. The authorities have not dispatched additional warships to Spain, and contrary to the harsh communique issued on Saturday, there is now a tendency to downplay the case. At the same time, the Basque government issued a communique in Bayonne, the content of which contradicts the German announcement. It is claimed that the "Palos" was carrying contraband war materials. According to reports, the ship was intercepted by Spanish government warships near Bilbao on December 26. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the German merchant ship "Palos" was detained by government warships of the Spanish Basque Autonomous Region in the waters of the region, it was rumored that German warships "Deutschland", "Admiral Scheer", cruiser "Nürnberg", and two destroyer squadrons had been ordered to sail to Spanish territorial waters.

<h3>Spanish Rebels Plan Offensive Strategy; British Embassy in Madrid to Move to Valencia Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Avila General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist government, yesterday met here with General Mola, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces in the north, to discuss the war situation. The meeting lasted one hour. Afterwards, he inspected various locations on the front lines. According to general knowledge, as a result of this meeting, the Nationalist forces will launch a large-scale offensive in the near future. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Madrid The rebels have repeatedly attacked the capital without success, and now there is a possibility of using poison gas as a last resort.

<p>Madrid The British Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Forbes, today warned 2,000 British citizens that the situation is becoming increasingly serious and that everyone should bring a suitcase for evacuation. Embassy staff are scheduled to withdraw to Valencia on Thursday. Most foreign residents are also preparing to evacuate. (National News dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Madrid The British government has decided to move its embassy here to Valencia, where the Spanish government is located. The 200 British citizens residing in Madrid must now decide within 24 hours whether to leave the country. British Chargé d'Affaires Forbes convened a special meeting at the embassy to explain everything to the British citizens. The situation was very tragic. Many British citizens only acquired British nationality because they were born in Gibraltar or other nearby British territories. If they do not decide to leave the country, they will lose the protection of the embassy, ​​and their lives may be in danger. As for the British government's decision to move the embassy, ​​it is because the Spanish government has no sign of returning to Madrid, and it is difficult for Forbes to maintain close contact with more important political authorities. Furthermore, it has become increasingly difficult to provide essential daily necessities to British embassy staff and British citizens still remaining in Madrid. If the embassy moves to Valencia, this difficulty can be greatly reduced. British ships can cooperate in supplying food and other items. As for the Dao and relief work, the Spanish government has consulted with the League of Nations and dispatched experts to conduct on-site investigations. It will then consider its report and make a decision. Therefore, the Spanish government cannot begin to implement the international relief plan until it receives the experts' report. Regarding voluntary organizations that are willing to work in Spain, they will continue as usual. Forbes will come to Madrid from time to time to assist in everything. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>American Aircraft Transported to Spain; State Department Issues Initial License</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was announced here today that the State Department has approved a license for the Vimalert Company to transport munitions to Spain. This is an unprecedented event since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The company has been approved to export second-hand engines and aircraft worth US$2,777,700 to Bilbao, presumably for the use of government forces. The State Department said that according to existing neutrality regulations, unless specifically prohibited by law, the government cannot refuse a merchant's request for a license, and the civil war is not within the scope of the neutrality regulations. It is said that Vimalert Company is not the only one to inquire about licensing with the State Department, but because this license will cause the State Department to feel difficult, the other inquiries have not requested it. Vimalert Company, however, insisted on the request despite the State Department's advice. The State Department has now issued two licenses, one for 18 aircraft worth $720,000, and one for 411 second-hand engines worth $2,057,000. The aircraft and engines still need to be repaired, which will take about two months. If Congress passes a ban before the shipment, the State Department can still revoke the issued license. (National News dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The current neutrality law's provisions on prohibiting the export of munitions only apply to external wars and not to civil wars in other countries. The US State Department recently issued an export permit in accordance with this law, allowing 18 aircraft and 411 engines to be transported to Spain and delivered to the country's Republican government. However, these aircraft and engines are all old items and will take two months to repair. From now until then, the US Congress may pass a new neutrality bill stipulating that various munitions export bans will also apply to civil wars in other countries, in which case the above-mentioned export permit may lose its validity. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the US State Department's approval of the shipment of 18 aircraft and 411 engines to Spain, responsible officials here recently declared that the British government intends to negotiate with the US State Department and explain that Britain and France have made many efforts to maintain peace and promote the implementation of the non-intervention agreement, which should not be hindered.

<p>(Washington) American citizens serving in the Spanish Civil War are now in danger of losing their citizenship. Congressional leaders have sought to prohibit American citizens from participating in wars in other countries. Representative McReynolds, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that he intends to ask the Department of Justice to pay attention to the prohibition in the criminal law regarding this matter. Because the law stipulates that people who participate in wars in other countries must be fined $3,000 and imprisoned for one year, according to the law, it is enough to prohibit American citizens from serving in foreign troops. Senator Borah expressed his strong support for McReynolds's intention, saying that American citizens participating in European wars would cause domestic difficulties. Therefore, he supported the revocation of citizenship. Other senators, such as Pittman, also had the same opinion. It is reported that there are currently several American famous pilots participating in the Spanish Civil War. They have organized an "American Team." (National News dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>Dutch Oil Magnate Purchases Large Quantities of Grain for German Winter Relief</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to official announcements, Dutch oil magnate Sir Henri Deterding is now using 10 million Dutch guilders to purchase agricultural products for Germany in the Netherlands. The government newspaper Angriff reports that this is a gift to Germany for "Winter Relief." It is reported that Deterding is 90 years old and has long been regarded as one of the main friends of the New Germany. He is currently the chairman of the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company. At the age of 16, he was admitted to Amsterdam's famous Twentsche Bank as the youngest employee. After working for six years, he decided to go to the Dutch East Indies to work for the Netherlands Trading Society for eight years, because he felt that the hope of promotion was very small. He first worked in Medan and then transferred to Penang. In 1896, he joined the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and was promoted to deputy manager one year later. In 1901, he was promoted to general manager, and one year later he was elected general manager of the parent company. He was knighted in 1920 for his contributions to promoting industry.

<p>Bombay The National Congress convened a meeting in Faizpur today and passed several anti-British resolutions, deciding to begin a passive resistance movement on April 1st of next year, when the new constitution is implemented. The resolutions stipulate the following: (1) If Britain goes to war with other countries, India will never participate, nor will it donate money or send soldiers to help Britain. (2) A meeting of all National Congress members will be convened to discuss effective ways to overthrow the new constitution. (National News dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Faizpur Today, the All-India Congress, after a lengthy debate, passed a resolution refusing the Indian Government Act of 1935 and implementing the constitution against the will of the Indian people. The resolution re-proposed a request to elect a representative assembly by adult voters in order to draft a new constitution. However, the issue of whether to assume the office of Congress members will be decided after the provincial elections. The Congress also passed a resolution prohibiting members of the Northern Conference from participating in or holding in India, and the coronation celebration of the British Emperor, and clarified that the passage of this case does not express ill will or disrespect to the British Emperor personally. The Indian Government Act of 1935 stipulates the establishment of an All-India Federal Province Autonomy and responsibilities for guarantees. In addition, there are detailed regulations on the distribution of power between the Federal Parliament and the Provincial Parliaments, the administrative relations between the Federation, the Provinces, and the Indian princes, the Federal Railway Authority, and the establishment of the Railway Court of Justice, the organization of the Federal Court, the organization of the Federal and Provincial Parliaments, and suffrage.

<h3>French Budget Proposal Submitted to the Senate for Discussion; Finance Minister Attends to Explain</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French budget year runs from January 1st to the end of each year. The budget proposal for 1937 is about to begin, and the budget proposal has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for a vote. It is now being discussed by the Senate. Today, the Senate will approve each chapter on income in the original proposal passed by the Chamber of Deputies, making only minor amendments to certain details, and it is scheduled to continue discussing the chapters on expenditure at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. After some minor amendments, the entire proposal can be passed by a vote and then sent back to the Chamber of Deputies for review, and passed by both houses on December 31st. During the Senate debate today, Finance Minister Olivo attended to explain, stating that "the 1937 budget proposal is an honest budget proposal. Recalling the implementation of the previous budget proposal (i.e., this year's budget proposal), in order to balance revenue and expenditure, the government had to issue more than 300 substitute legal orders to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. However, since 1928, France's annual budget expenditure has always been between 45,000,000,000 and 50,000,000,000 francs. Among them, the principal and interest payments on various public debts account for 48% of the total budget expenditure, while various military expenditures account for 18% of the total expenditure. From this, it can be seen that the government has spent 66% of the national financial resources on paying for the burden of the last major war and avoiding the occurrence of future wars. As for the expenditure used for national production, it is only 16,000,000,000 francs, which has been reduced to the bare minimum. The amount of budget revenue and expenditure should be determined by the national economic life. According to the government's estimation, the French economy has a trend of recovery and prosperity, which can be seen from the recent increase in tax revenue. An examination of the income from various direct taxes in 1936 shows an increase of 22% compared to 1935. Moreover, according to recent statistics, the textile and steel industries have both seen a revival, the number of unemployed people has decreased, and the amount of exports has continued to increase. All of these are signs of economic recovery." Olivo concluded by expressing the hope that the arms race among various countries would not continue. Although various nations are currently independent of each other, they will soon recognize the necessity of economic unity due to the pressure of the situation. After Olivo finished his speech, the majority of the senators applauded and praised him. The chairman of the Finance Committee, former Finance Minister Caillaux, then gave a brief speech, outlining several financial principles, but expressing his overall support for Olivo's financial policy. ) (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet submitted a bill to the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, requesting approval for the government to guarantee a huge loan of 2,250,000,000 francs to Poland, of which 1,405,000 francs will be used by Poland to strengthen its national defense, and another 845,000,000 francs will be used to build railways to connect Upper Silesia to the port of Gdynia. This bill was recently passed by the Chamber of Deputies with 590 votes to zero. Before the vote, most of the deputies expressed their opinions, saying that the good relations between France and Poland are a necessary condition for maintaining peace. Foreign Minister Delbos then gave a speech, saying that "the new agreement between France and Poland, which was concluded at the end of August, emphasizes that the efforts made by both parties to maintain peace can be mutually understood and used in an atmosphere of sincere cooperation." The materials needed for Poland's national defense will also be purchased from France. In short, Poland's national defense is closely related to France's national defense.

<h3>Germany Massively Builds Warships; Naval Officers Also Greatly Increased; First Announcement in Three Years</h3>
<p>(London) The German government has recently released a naval register, which is the first time in three years. The speed at which Germany has been building its fleet since 1934 can be clearly seen from this. The table lists a total of two 26,000-ton battleships that Germany has launched, and two 35,000-ton battleships that have already been started. A total of two 10,000-ton cruisers have been launched, and 12 have already been started. A total of 16 large destroyers have been launched, and 6 super destroyers have already been started. A total of 12 mine boats have already been started, and 36 submarines have been launched, with many more under construction. The Daily Telegraph quoted naval expert Mr. Bywater as drawing attention to the large increase in German naval officers, saying that this is the most noteworthy feature of Germany's naval expansion. In the past three years, the number of naval officer candidates and officers has increased from 187 to 1,160. This shows that the German government still intends to continue to expand its navy. Mr. Bywater also cited unofficial but reliable sources as saying that the number of lower-level German naval personnel has increased from 12,000 to 31,000 in the past three years, and is expected to increase to 40,000 next year.

<h3>Naval Issues; US Responds to Britain and Japan; Declares Reservation of Warships</h3>
<p>(Washington) The British government previously notified the United States and Japan that it intends to invoke Article 21 of the London Naval Treaty, namely the escalator clause, to reserve five cruisers with a total of 21,000 tons that have reached their service age. The Japanese government subsequently notified the United States and Britain that it would invoke the escalator clause to reserve 15,000 tons of submarines that have reached their service age. (According to reports, Britain initially requested to reserve 40,000 tons of destroyers, while Japan, due to the small tonnage of destroyers that have reached their service age, requested to reserve submarines as compensation.) Regarding this matter, the US State Department will submit separate replies. Semi-official sources recently stated that the US reply to Britain will declare that it intends to reserve several cruisers, with a tonnage greater than that reserved by Britain. Its reply to Japan will declare that it also intends to reserve 15,000 tons of submarines. In addition, it will notify Britain and Japan that two US destroyer squadrons that have reached their service age will still be reserved. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>US Maritime Workers' Strike; Negotiations Deadlocked</h3>
<p>(San Francisco) Representatives of shipping companies and maritime workers' unions met today to discuss the maritime workers' strike issue, but it has once again reached a deadlock. The reason is that the shipping companies still insist on being able to freely choose the officers of each ship regardless of union relations, while the union representatives insist on giving priority to hiring union members, which led to the breakdown of negotiations without any results.

<p>(New York) The situation of the sailors' strike here has become tense again today.

<h3>Britain Intensifies; Expanding Naval and Air Force Armaments; British Newspapers Discuss Pacific Situation; Advocate Guaranteeing Philippine Independence; US Reconsiders Airship Policy</h3>
<p>(London) Britain's military reorganization plan will be intensified at the beginning of next year, with a planned expenditure of more than 100 million pounds more than this year. In terms of the navy, the government will build two battleships, five cruisers, one aircraft carrier, 18 destroyers, and six submarines, requiring an expenditure of 30 million pounds. In terms of the air force, it will build 2,000 aircraft, and separately manufacture a large number of aircraft parts for temporary storage for temporary assembly and application. In addition, it will complete the national industrial equipment to supply wartime needs. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) "The Yorkshire Post," the mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Eden, recently published an article discussing the Pacific situation, stating that "Japanese Foreign Minister Arita will soon issue a declaration supporting cooperation between Japan and the United States to avoid an arms race in the Pacific. When a new Pacific peace treaty is concluded in the future, it can include guaranteeing the neutral status of the Philippines. If the Philippine Islands fall into the hands of Japan, the interests that Britain holds in the Far East will inevitably be threatened. Therefore, as far as Britain is concerned, it would be most welcome to conclude an agreement guaranteeing respect for Philippine independence." (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the successive misfortunes of the two major US airships, Akron and Macon, the airship business came to a standstill. Now the Navy Department is once again studying the new airship construction procedures proposed by the Bureau of Aeronautics. Rear Admiral Cooke, the director of the bureau, also requested the authorities to increase the strength of the Navy's combat aircraft, aviation personnel, and the convenience of coastal air stations in his annual report. According to Cooke, the former director, Rear Admiral King, submitted to Secretary of the Navy Swanson in May this year a procedure for continuing to build airships based on the report of the scientific committee that studied the airship problem for about a year. The scientific committee report strongly stated that although US airships have encountered two misfortunes, the US participation in the airship development plan should not be stopped because of this, and proposed a carefully considered procedure for building airships. It is heard that the above report and the Bureau of Aeronautics' recommendations are currently being considered by senior Navy commissioners, and a final decision on the US policy of rebuilding airships can be made based on this.

<h3>US New Deal; President Roosevelt; Intends to Make It Last for a Long Time</h3>
<p>(Washington) Many New Deal laws are about to expire. The new Congress will convene on January 5th next year. The legislative procedures to be dealt with are very heavy. President Roosevelt has the backing of a majority of members in both houses. If he intends to retain them, he can make the various expired laws temporarily continue to be effective. However, what Roosevelt hopes for is a more permanent solution. When the various laws were passed, most of them stated that they were of a trial nature, so the deadlines set were also very short. The time has now come to select all the effective new programs and find ways to make them permanent, while letting other impractical ones expire. This is a method of reforming and consolidating the New Deal. The procedures are very complicated and difficult to carry out, and it is feared that it will take at least two years of Roosevelt's term in office. There are now two committees studying the possibility of simplifying the government's agency system and rationalizing the entire federal administration. They have already completed their work. President Roosevelt's advisors are now awaiting the reports of the above two committees to use as a basis for completely reorganizing the various parts of the government to save money and avoid the drawbacks of duplicated efforts. The temporary agencies established during Roosevelt's first term as president are as numerous as bamboo shoots after a rain. If all the plans are completed, they will all disappear. Temporary laws that have been effective will naturally become permanent, and the temporary agencies for these laws will also take a place in the existing parts of the government. The three most important of the expired laws and their expiration dates are listed below: (1) The law establishing the 200 million US dollar stabilization fund and devaluing the gold dollar (expires on January 30th); (2) The law on concluding reciprocal trade agreements (expires on June 12th); (3) The Neutrality Act (expires on May 1st). The United Kingdom is one of the most relevant countries to the expiration of the reciprocal trade agreement. According to news from London, the United States and Britain are currently engaged in negotiations to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement, and the progress is very smooth. However, due to the unexpired Ottawa Agreement, it is feared that it will take several months to complete. Even in the United States, the Senate may not agree with the government's move to make reciprocal trade agreements permanent, so the best result would be to temporarily extend them for a few years. The United States, Britain, and France have already established a monetary understanding when the franc was devalued, which shows that the US exchange stabilization fund will continue to exist on a permanent basis. People here are quite worried about the large amount of European money invested in US stocks and believe that the exchange stabilization fund is the best way to protect the domestic economy from foreign currency disturbances. As for whether the US president's power to devalue the gold dollar will still be retained, it is not yet known. Under another permanent law, it has been discovered that the Ministry of Finance has the power to set the price of gold bought and sold by the Federal Reserve Banks in gold dollars. Some critics believe that this power is sufficient to supply the exchange value of francs and pounds, and the flexibility required before gold was specified. The general opinion is that the situation will be different if the president continues to have the power to change the gold content of the gold dollar. Considering that President Roosevelt recently ordered Mr. McReynolds, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to read in detail the records of neutrality issues that occurred during the last major war and instructed him to pay attention to the report of Mr. Warren, the special prosecutor who managed neutrality affairs during the era of former President Wilson, it can be known that Roosevelt already has the idea of a new Neutrality Act and hopes to have it passed in the next Congress. The scope of the permanent Neutrality Act is naturally broader than the current temporary act. Due to the result of the Spanish Civil War, there are concerns about establishing additional regulations prohibiting the supply of military equipment and money to groups that are fighting against the government recognized by the public, but in the current temporary act, this kind of prohibition is impossible. The government can only use moral persuasion to prevent its citizens from supplying money, guns, and aircraft to the anti-government forces in Spain. The proposed new Neutrality Act may also include strict restrictions on the regulations for profiting during wartime. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>Amid the Silence of the Sui War, the Japanese and Puppet Troops Are Busy Transferring; Hot Troops Are Pouring Westward, Prince Te Is Forcibly Conscripting Recruits; Bandit Planes Occasionally Fly from Jiabusi to Suidong to Reconnoiter</h3>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: Since the National Army recovered Damiao and Bailingmiao, the puppet bandits have almost completely perished in the mutiny and casualties. The preliminary stage has come to an end. In addition to coercing Prince Te to forcibly conscript Mongolian recruits to serve as sacrifices, a certain party is also realizing its predetermined plan, driving the hot troops to occupy Chahar North, seeking to advance westward, and opening up Chahar and Sui. In this situation, the war news on the Sui border has been extremely silent recently.</p>
<p>Transporting Military Equipment is Extremely Busy</p>
<p>As for the current situation of bandits and puppets in Chahar North, the transfer of troops and transportation of equipment is extremely busy. Regarding the transportation of military fire, a certain party is transporting a large batch of 180 tons of military fire, which will now be completely transported to Zhangbei one after another. On the 26th, more than ten heavy-duty trucks of wooden boards, six vehicles of kerosene and gasoline were transported from the pass. The gasoline stored in Zhangbei the day before has now been transported to Shangdu and Jiabusi for storage separately. Most of the gasoline for aircraft engines is stored in Jiabusi. The machinery and ammunition supplied to the bandits and puppets are transported out of Zhangbei at an average of about ten vehicles per day (from the 20th to the 26th), with the final destinations being Jiabusi, Nanhanchang, and Shangdu.</p>
<p>Hot River Troops Actively Move Westward</p>
<p>Regarding the transfer of troops, the Li Shouxin and Wang Jingxiu troops stationed in Zhangbei City, totaling more than 700 people, were all dispatched to Nanhanchang on the 24th. The Wu Guting troops from Kangbao Hot River, totaling more than 700 people, arrived in Jiabusi on the 25th, and were dispatched from the temple to the Shangdu front line to reinforce on the morning of the 26th. The Wu troops still have more than 8,000 people, stationed in Duolun, Weichang, and Dage. They have now received orders from a certain party to move west in full force within days. Zhang Haipeng's Hot River troops, numbering several thousand, are currently stationed in Guyuan. Since the 24th, Zhang has been conscripting a large number of pancakes and fried rice and other easy-to-carry foods from the people, and is also preparing to move west within days. The rumor that the hot troops are retreating eastward recently is actually inaccurate.</p>
<p>Prince Te Forcibly Conscripts Xilin Gol Recruits</p>
<p>According to a person from Jiabusi, on the morning of the 26th, three bandit planes flew west from the temple to scout around Suidong, and then flew back. Prince Te recently dispatched more than 20 of his subordinates to the various banners of the Xilin Gol League under Chahar North to forcibly recruit and train recruits. However, the general Mongols, in view of the heavy casualties of the recruits previously conscripted, regarded joining the army for training with fear and shrank back, and mostly fled into the pass. There were very few who responded to the call. In addition, the bandit army under Zhang Niwanzuo, stationed in Nanhanchang, has been almost completely depleted due to desertion. A few days ago, he personally went to Jiabusi to plot expansion with a certain special agency chief. It is estimated that the special agency chief has requested him to do so, so Zhang left Jiabusi on the 24th to reorganize his troops in Nanhanchang, and returned again on the evening of the 25th, running back and forth, and the situation was extremely rushed.</p>
<h3>The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee Adds; Wanping and Tianjin Administrative Districts; Commanded Nearby by the Beijing-Tianjin Municipal Governments; The Scope of the Two Administrative Districts Has Also Been Delineated</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has recently expanded the powers of the Tianjin and Beijing Municipal Governments. Hebei Province has added two administrative districts. The expansion of the powers of the Tianjin Municipal Government has been clearly ordered. All five agencies of the Hebei Province Maritime Public Security Bureau, Wuhe Water Public Security Bureau, Inland River Transportation Bureau, Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner, and Tianjin Security Commander are under the nearby command of the Tianjin Municipal Government. These five agencies will change their official document format from January next year and submit them to the Municipal Government. This may be due to changes in personnel, but it is an expedient measure and should not be criticized. On the 23rd of this month, the Political Affairs Committee further ordered the establishment of the Tianjin and Wanping Administrative Districts. The Wanping District consists of Daxing, Wanping, Tongxian, and Changping counties as administrative regions, with the Wanping County Magistrate serving as the Administrative Commissioner. The Tianjin District consists of Tianjin, Jinghai, Wuqing, Ninghe, and other four counties as administrative regions, with the Tianjin County Magistrate serving as the Administrative Commissioner. In addition to Chen Zhongyue, the original Tianjin County Magistrate, being appointed as the Tianjin District Commissioner, it is understood that Wang Lengzhai, a member of the Beijing Municipal Government, will be appointed as the Wanping District Commissioner and will be officially appointed soon. Because the Wanping District is close to Beijing City, it is under the nearby command of the Beijing Municipal Government. Because the Tianjin District is close to Tianjin City, it is under the nearby command of the Tianjin Municipal Government. The organization of the two public offices is the same as the Daming and Fangshan districts of Hebei Province, so no separate regulations will be drafted. However, personnel matters and the layout of the public offices also require considerable preparation. The two offices are expected to start operating in mid-January next year.</p>
<p>After the clear order was issued, the general public analyzed the jurisdiction of the two districts. Tongxian and Changping counties in the Wanping District are administrative regions of the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization. Ninghe County in the Tianjin District is also under the jurisdiction of the puppet organization. The purpose of the authorities in setting up the districts can be thought of halfway through. However, the puppet organization itself felt greatly uneasy. Yin Rugeng convened a cadre meeting, and the puppet leaders from Tongxian and Tangshan attended. It is understood that the result was to quickly send representatives to visit a certain military authority in Tianjin to ask for countermeasures. On the morning of the 24th, Zhang Renli, the puppet civil affairs director of "Hebei East", secretly came to Tianjin from Tongxian and stayed in the Tokiwa Hotel in a certain concession. His whereabouts were quite secret, presumably as a representative of the puppet side.</p>
<h3>The Provincial Government of Shanxi Orders County Magistrates to Conscientiously Handle Village System Improvement; Promulgates Important Points for Implementing the Village System Improvement Process; Village Chiefs to Be Selected and Sent for Training Starting March 1 Next Year</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The Shanxi Provincial Government, in order to thoroughly improve local administration and increase political efficiency, has, in addition to organizing a Local Administrative Personnel Examination Committee to train county magistrates, district chiefs, section chiefs, and police officers, who are then assigned to serve in various counties, formulated and promulgated a General Outline for Improving the District System, a General Outline for Improving the Village System, and Rules for the Selection and Appointment of Village Chiefs and Deputies. It is learned that the Provincial Government has now stipulated six measures for training village chiefs and important points for implementing the process, and instructed all counties on the 26th to select and send village chiefs in accordance with these instructions. A total of 1,300 people will be selected from the entire province, scheduled to report to the province from February 24 to 28 next year and begin training on March 1. This is a prelude to the modernization of Shanxi's politics. The remarks of the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the original text of the Provincial Government's instructions, and the important points for implementing the village system improvement process are explored and recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs</p>
<p>According to the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Qiu, regarding the implementation policy of the village system improvement, "The village is the basic unit of administration. If village governance is well-managed, the foundation of politics can be consolidated and politics can be refreshed. Director Yan and Chairman Zhao, in view of this, have decided to improve the village system, and county magistrates, district chiefs, and village chiefs will all receive training to instill modern knowledge. Now, many county magistrates and district chiefs who have completed their training have been assigned to serve in various counties. After the village chiefs receive training in the future, everything will be renewed from top to bottom, and Shanxi's politics will have great progress. However, the selection of village chiefs is a crucial key to improving the village system. Whether the selection of village chiefs can find the right people is of great importance. In order to ensure that county and district chiefs handle this matter responsibly and properly, the provincial government has specifically stipulated that the excellence of the training results of the village chiefs selected in the future will be used as a standard for evaluating county and district chiefs and assisting personnel. In addition to this, it is also hoped that knowledgeable people in the province, counties, districts, and villages will pay attention to this, explain it to people who do not understand, and supervise any favoritism in the counties and districts without being polite. It is essential to ensure that good people are selected as village chiefs in every village. If every village can get a good village chief in the future, then the new village system will surely achieve perfect results after its implementation, so that village governance in our province will shine in the whole country."</p>
<p>Provincial Government Instructions</p>
<p>"The General Outline for Improving the Village System and the Rules for the Selection, Appointment, and Treatment of Village Chiefs and Deputies have been formulated and promulgated, and orders have been issued to the counties to study them in advance. This time, the village system improvement is a fundamental task for refreshing the politics of our province. The selection of village chiefs is an especially important key to improving the village system. The responsibility for whether the selected village chiefs are qualified rests entirely with the county magistrates and district chiefs. Whenever a policy is implemented, there is always the hope of achieving perfect results at the beginning of the launch and planning. However, due to improper handling, the opposite often happens. Examining the reasons, 40% are due to poor technical skills in the affairs, and 60% are due to irresponsibility in handling affairs. As a result, even if the current situation is not good, people not only dare not lightly make reforms, but also dare not lightly have the heart to reform. Thinking of this makes people shudder. Now, at the beginning of the improvement, how should all our county and district personnel encourage each other and strive to achieve complete success? It is now stipulated that the excellence of the training results of the village chiefs selected in the future will be used as a standard for evaluating the county and district chiefs and assisting personnel. For example, if a district selects 20 village chiefs, the total score of the 20 people at the end of the training will be averaged to calculate the district chief's score. The county magistrate will calculate the total number of people selected from the entire county, and the assisting personnel will be evaluated according to their assistance. A special assessment will be conducted at the end of the training. The trained village chiefs are scheduled to report to the province from February 24 to 28, 26th year, and begin training on March 1. It is essential to select and send them to the province on time. Do not delay the progress of the entire plan due to the delay of one county. All training and treatment measures are as follows: (1) The training period is set at three months, divided into military affairs, politics, and technical affairs training. (2) During the training period, board and lodging expenses will be provided by the province. In addition, each person will be paid six yuan per month by the original village that selected them. (3) Those who pass the training will be issued a certificate of qualification and will be appointed by the county as the village chief of the village that originally selected them. (4) During training, leave of absence or arbitrary withdrawal is not allowed unless there is an illness that has been diagnosed as true. Violators will have all expenses recovered. (5) Those who fail the training will not be allowed to be employed. The vacancy will be filled by the second-ranked village chief candidate from the original village that selected them, who will be sent to the province for supplementary training. (6) The round-trip travel expenses of the trained village chiefs to the province will be calculated according to the ticket price if they travel by train or car. If they travel by land, the price of eight corners will be issued for every 80 li of the journey, and the daily travel expense will be five corners, all of which will be paid from the county's local funds. The process and precautions for improving the village system are hereby printed and distributed along with the order. You are to comply with the order, supervise your subordinates to earnestly handle the matter on time, and be careful not to make any mistakes regarding this important political matter. This order."</p>
<p>Implementation Procedures</p>
<p>Implementation Procedures and Precautions for Improving the Village System in Various Counties of Shanxi Province, from January 1 to February 10, 26th year: (January 1) In accordance with the received order and instructions regarding the General Outline for Improving the Village System and the Implementation Procedures, as well as the Rules for the Selection, Appointment, and Treatment of Village Chiefs and Deputies, the following matters should be handled: (1) Report the date of the received order by telegram. (2) Notify the district chiefs and one assistant in each district to bring the latest household registration book of the district to the county for a meeting on January 3. (3) Instruct the chief of the First Section to print and prepare for distribution the key points regarding the expansion of the new village establishment and the selection and training of village chiefs, as well as the Rules for the Selection, Appointment, and Treatment of Village Chiefs and Deputies, within the General Outline for Improving the Village System and the Implementation Procedures, according to the total number of village chiefs and deputies and county and district personnel in the entire county. (4) Notify the chief of the Public Security Bureau and the chiefs of all sections and supervisors to participate in the meeting when the district chiefs and assistants are convened. (January 2) Convene the chiefs of all sections, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and the chief of the First District to thoroughly study and understand the General Outline and Implementation Procedures, as well as the Rules for the Selection, Appointment, and Treatment of Village Chiefs and Deputies, and formulate a specific plan from the beginning to the end according to the situation in the county. Proceed in order and ensure that the plan is completed on time. Be considerate and ensure that no mistakes occur in the middle. (January 3) When all the district chiefs and assistants arrive, hold a meeting immediately. Assistants will attend to provide consultation. (1) The county magistrate will report the purpose of the meeting. (2) Discuss each article of the General Outline for Improving the Village System, the Implementation Procedures, and the Rules for the Selection, Appointment, and Treatment of Village Chiefs and Deputies clearly, and ask if there are any difficulties. After the district chiefs express their opinions as much as possible regarding the situation of the villages under their jurisdiction, study and handle the methods in detail. (3) The county magistrate should refer to the overall map of the county, the total number of households and their locations in each village, and the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the General Outline, and consider the actual situation. The section chiefs and district chiefs should make preliminary plans for the districts in order of resolution. The following items should be noted: A. The county magistrate should adopt the opinions of the district chiefs in the district as much as possible. The section chiefs, bureau chiefs, supervisors, etc., who know the details of the village conditions, history, mountains, and terrain, must describe them in detail for selection. B. The village establishment affairs must take into account the terrain, distance, and history of each village in the entire county, but do not temporarily accommodate the village conditions, which may cause the distance between the united villages to be too far, making it difficult to unite and causing long-term inconvenience in handling affairs. C. When making preliminary village establishments, the location of the village office should be tentatively determined for each village establishment. If the location is an independently established village, it will occupy its original village office. If it is a joint village establishment, it should be located in the village with the largest population in the village establishment. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Artificial Propagation of Laver; Successful Results of Zhejiang Aquatic Products Experiment Field</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Among the important edible algae, laver is the most delicious and valuable. It is produced along the coast and on the islands of Zhejiang Province. Statistics show that the annual output is only three to four thousand catties. Because it has always been known only to collect natural products, the output is very small and the price is extremely high. The experiment field wanted to use science to increase production. Last year, artificial propagation experiments were conducted in the waters off Putuo. Initially, due to inadequate equipment, the results were not significant. Therefore, the field director Chen Tongbai and technician Chen Chunshou re-planned in detail, and put the attached materials into the water to make them occur artificially. Recently, it has been found that the propagation is flourishing and spectacular, and the quality is better than that of natural products, and the flavor is exceptionally delicious. According to the person in charge of the field, this artificial propagation method has been completely successful. Once a way is found to make it economically viable, it will be promoted, and it will be possible to produce it in large quantities in the future to help the people's food and enrich their lives.</p>
<h3>Jiading; West Township Captures Bandit Ship</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 26th, a bandit ship with more than a dozen bandits arrived in Hengjing Village, Wangxian Township, Fourth District. The villagers caught sight of it, but remained calm and reported to the Waigang District Office. District Chief Xu and Inspector Zhu of the District Office and the Public Security Sub-station led dozens of militiamen and police officers to ambush and capture the ship. One bandit, Lu Ayin, from Loutang County, was captured. On the ship were two sacks of Hui's Ruizhi Yizhuang, a package of red dates, and four pawn tickets. The people and the spoils were taken to the district and then to the county for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi; Bizarre Male Corpse Discovered</h3>
<p>A nameless male corpse was suddenly discovered yesterday in the culvert next to the field bank of a certain family in Caowangjing, Third District. The corpse was wearing a blue cloth cotton jacket and cotton pants, with a new hemp rope tied around his waist. There was an old hemp car bag next to the corpse. However, his head and upper body were drilled into the hole, and his face was unrecognizable. His waist was bent and his back was hunched, and his condition was miserable. The cause of death was bizarre.</p>
<h3>Intercepting a Large Number of Bandit Ships</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of Shuihuo Gang bandit ships arrived in Yijingdang, near Dangkou Town, Eighth District, intending to rob Binhu Town. The incident was detected by the detective team of the Public Security Bureau of this county. They ordered detective Bu Xiang to cooperate with the local water and land police corps to search and arrest them. Eleven bandit ships were intercepted on the spot, and eight bandits were arrested. A large number of stolen goods were also found on the ships. They were escorted to the city yesterday and sent to the Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang; Implementation of Police District System</h3>
<p>The police district system in Jiangsu Province has been implemented with good results. The provincial government has already promulgated the outline of the implementation measures of the police district system. According to the person in charge of the Department of Civil Affairs, the number of students recommended and applying to the police school in various counties of Jiangsu Province is very common. The police officers trained by the school were originally the cadres for implementing the police district system. Now that the experiment has been effective and beneficial to the local administration, it should be actively promoted. As for whether all counties should implement it uniformly, it depends on the efforts of local officials.</p>
<h3>Promoting Rural Sideline Occupations</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the abnormal depression of the rural economy in various counties in Jiangbei in recent years, believes that relying solely on primary industry production is not enough to maintain the lives of farmers. Therefore, it has repeatedly ordered various counties to actively promote rural sideline occupations in Jiangbei, so that farmers can use their spare time and land with a small amount of capital to engage in production. Since the provincial government has strictly supervised the promotion in various counties, the results have been quite significant. The price of the increased products in various counties is said to have reached more than one million yuan, and the authorities are still trying to promote it.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on a Trip to Europe (4)</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent in Europe, Lieshan</p>
<p>From then on, not only would it be impossible for Germans and Jews to marry in Germany, but even their love affairs would be subject to legal sanctions. In addition to being recognized as "racially demeaning," the two parties would also face two or three years in prison. Such cases can almost always be found in German newspapers several times a month.</p>
<p>Why are the National Socialists so determined to exclude Jews? We can understand that people of Jewish descent are not allowed to hold public office in Germany. But why should even private love affairs be interfered with? Some people say that Mr. Hitler was once stimulated by Jews in Vienna. Although this cannot be considered the main reason, Jews have never been welcomed by the general public in Germany, not only in Germany but also in other countries in Europe.</p>
<p>The discrimination against Jews in Germany is, first, because they are a different race. Secondly, Jews are good at doing business. It is very common for a grandfather to be a cattle and sheep broker, the father to be a shop owner, and the son to be a businessman or a large industrialist. (We only need to remember the life of Shanghai Jewish tycoon Hardoon.) This naturally arouses the resentment of the Germans, especially after the European War, when groups of Jews from Poland, Russia, and other places immigrated to Germany. They not only made high-interest loans to German farmers, but also took advantage of the devaluation of the German mark to speculate as much as possible. After a considerable period of time, the originally ragged brokers became wealthy households. The root cause of the Jews' resentment lies in this point. As a result, Hitler called out and everyone responded, creating the current situation. Many Germans know that this anti-Jewish policy is too inhumane, but who dares to have another opinion in the current atmosphere?</p>
<p>I remember once talking to a certain gentleman in charge of Jewish affairs in the National Socialist Party about this issue. He asked, "Are there any Jews in China?" I said, "Although there are some Jews in China, they have not yet become a problem. Precisely because of this, it is not easy for us to understand your country's anti-Jewish policy. If we can explain to our readers, 'Jews are like our neighbors,' then everyone will immediately understand what is going on. But Jews are a nation without a country, and why are all Jews 'inferior'?"</p>
<p>He said, "Jews are at home everywhere and have no concept of a country. Today they can be Germans, and tomorrow they can become French or British, as long as it is beneficial to them personally..." We often hear his theory, but all Jews are bad guys without exception. As long as a person has some Jewish blood in his body, whether on the father's side or the mother's side, or even the father's parents, a Jewish person will be classified as an "inferior race." This logic does not seem to be something we can understand. The prerequisite for a German citizen today is that he must have clean ancestors, both on the paternal and maternal sides, tracing back to 1800, when there was no Jewish blood mixed in.</p>
<p>Thirteen. Further Discussion on the Jewish Question</p>
<p>After Hitler came to power and implemented the anti-Jewish policy, people generally worried about Hitler. The reason is that almost all the financial institutions and international trade in the world are in the hands of Jews. If Jews in various countries unite to impose economic sanctions on Germany, then Germany's finances will immediately fall into a predicament. Although, as the reporter knows, Germany's foreign trade has been affected by the anti-Jewish policy in recent years, the racial consciousness of the Jews is far different from what we expected.</p>
<p>For example, in trade with Germany, many foreign Jewish merchants, especially Jewish merchants in Britain and the Czech Republic, have always been good customers of the industrial products of the Third Reich in recent years. They even come to Germany to purchase goods in person. Where personal interests lie, racial issues can be put aside. This is a typical Jewish merchant. On the other hand, the reason why Jews in various countries dare not actively assist German Jews is probably to expand the "anti-Jewish issue," which would affect their own status. In the eyes of Jews, it is easy to deal with the anti-Jewish issue in a single Germany. If the Jewish issue also occurs in Britain, the United States, and France, then their future will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Almost everyone in every country has a sense of aversion to Jews. I remember when I was in school, if a classmate was called a "Jew," he would feel more uncomfortable than if he was scolded with other words. In European countries, an ordinary Jew cannot enjoy equal treatment unless he has special talents or money. The atmosphere of anti-Jewish sentiment, from Nuremberg (the place where anti-Jewish sentiment is the most severe in Germany) to Palestine, there are seeds of anti-Jewish sentiment wherever Jews exist.</p>
<p>The ideal way to solve the Jewish question may be to let them form their own country. In this way, many disputes can be avoided. Secondly, the Jews themselves should change their way of life and stop only focusing on money, which would arouse the resentment of the people of the local country. Although not all Jews are capitalists, most of the world's wealthy people are Jews, especially in many large and small cities, where the bigwigs who control economic power are also Jews. Some people say that as long as Jews engage in less industry and commerce, half of the Jewish question can be solved.</p>
<p>Since Germany had an anti-Jewish issue, some Jews have immigrated to South America, Palestine, Soviet Russia, and other places. I heard that some of them have also come to China. We Chinese people certainly do not talk about racial issues, but I hope that these people will not forget the reasons why they could not stand in Germany, even though they were implicated by some of their fellow citizens.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou; Citywide Rickshaw Strike</h3>
<p>The First Branch of the Public Security Bureau of this county, in view of the many dangers of rickshaws carrying goods and the damage to the road surface, summoned rickshaw merchants to specially manufacture 30 freight vehicles. Since the implementation, those who use rickshaws to transport goods have been detained. All rickshaw drivers believe that they can only carry passengers, and their business is very small, which greatly affects their livelihoods. Therefore, they collectively agreed to strike, so rickshaws have disappeared on the streets, and they plan to petition the county government to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Nanjing; Students from Zhongda University Visit Quan Hua</h3>
<p>The College of Agriculture of the National Central University in the capital believes that in addition to chemical industry experiments, they must also visit the site to learn from it, so as to prove the gains and losses in theory. However, there are not many emerging chemical industries in Nanjing. Only the Quanhua Soy Sauce Factory outside Hsimen's Erdaogengzi can be used for research. Therefore, Professor Shen Xueyuan of the school obtained the consent of the factory in advance, and led the whole class of students to visit the factory at 2 pm yesterday. They made detailed inquiries about the manufacturing process of soy sauce, and visited the manufacturing rooms for boiling beans, making koji, squeezing oil, disinfecting, and bottling. As a result, the teachers and students were very satisfied. They believed that it was the most perfect soy sauce factory among the emerging industries in the country. Not only has it significantly improved the people's food hygiene, but it can also resist the import of foreign soy sauce and recover the rights and interests. The visit ended and they returned to school at 6 pm.</p>
<h3>Ningbo; Prison Break Tragedy</h3>
<p>The Ninghai County Prison holds more than a hundred thieves and other criminals. Each is nailed with shackles, and the security is very strict. Around 1 a.m. on the 27th, the criminals suddenly broke out of prison at the same time. One group broke out of the back wall, and the other group broke through the prison door, then jumped down from the roof. The shackles they were wearing were secretly filed off in advance. At that time, it was a clear moonlit night. When County Magistrate Li Hanfu heard the news, he got up in his underwear, took a gun and led the police to surround and arrest them, and ordered emergency measures to be taken and opened fire to suppress them. Sixteen escaped prisoners were shot dead on the spot and fell near the road. The situation was terrible.</p>
<h3>Wuchang Road Opens to Traffic on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The Wuwei Road from Wuxiangqi in Yinxian County to Changtiaozui in Zhenhai, which is more than 30 kilometers long, was built by the Defense Command and has been completed. It is leased to Ningchuan Long-distance Bus Company for traffic. There are five stations on the entire road, and it is scheduled to open to traffic on New Year's Day.</p>

<h3>Beining Railway Football Team Left Tianjin Last Night and Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; A Group of More Than Ten People Is Scheduled to Stay at the New Asia Hotel; Donghua Will Change to Fight French and Chinese Businessmen on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The Beining Railway Football Team, which is known as the champion of North China, has been contacted by the National Sports Promotion Association since it decided to come to Shanghai during the New Year holiday to play against Donghua and French and Chinese businessmen. The order has been arranged. It will play against Donghua on New Year's Day and French and Chinese businessmen on the 3rd. It is learned that Mr. Wang Yimin, the officer of the team, sent a telegram to Mr. Lu Zhongen in this city yesterday, saying that the whole team has left on the night train yesterday (29th) and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (31st) afternoon. He also asked Mr. Lu to book the New Asia Hotel for accommodation. The telegram also mentioned that the team plans to play against French and Chinese businessmen on New Year's Day and then against Donghua. Therefore, the order announced by the Promotion Association the day before yesterday may be changed. Moreover, there is also a Shanghai League A match between Donghua and Jinan on the 3rd, which is also in conflict. The lineup of the Beining team has also been reported by the team's telegram. The leader is officer Wang Yimin, but there are still several reserve players whose names are unknown. The list is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Beining Lineup</p>
<p>Chen Erde</p>
<p>Zhang Xueyao Li Qingyu</p>
<p>Sun Yating Sun Sijing Liang Mingzong</p>
<p>Jiang Kun Jiang Lu Sun Yongquan Sun Fulai Mao Fusheng</p>
<h3>Wrestling Performance; Huang Bochang Defeats Miha Again; Huang Loses Once and Then Wins Twice in a Row</h3>
<p>In the wrestling performance last night, Huang Bochang defeated "Indian Tiger" Miha by two to one again. Apidu from Yuanshan was originally scheduled to appear in the match, but because Apidu's arm was injured, Miha, who was thrown down by Huang with an airplane style for the first time, was temporarily replaced to compete. The competition was still fierce and tense. In the fourth round, Huang was once twisted by Miha's forearm and lost due to being unable to support. In the fifth round, the fight was the most fierce. Miha was thrown five somersaults in a row by Huang. Finally, his feet were twisted, and Miha could not bear the pain and gave up. In the sixth round, Miha was pressed under Huang's body, and his feet were twisted. Miha could not get up, so Huang won. The audience was very enthusiastic. Huang's technology is indeed above all the Indians. The reason why the Indians have been defeated repeatedly is nothing more than using Huang to attract a large number of our country's audience.</p>
<h3>Xiqing Basketball: Qingguang Threatens Jinan, Jinan Wins in Overtime</h3>
<p>The Xiqing basketball team's makeup game against Chizhi at Nanyang the night before was declared forfeited due to Nanyang's absence. Last night, after Mr. Jin Guoquan, Nanyang's instructor, explained that they had not received the makeup game notification, Xiqing understood. Therefore, the Nanyang vs. Chizhi game will be rescheduled. Last night, Nanyang played against Fudan. Although Nanyang fought hard, the difference in strength was too great, and the entire game was one-sided. As a result, Fudan took a 25-11 lead, and then won again 33-16. The final score was 58-25, a big win for Fudan. The second game was Jinan against Qingguang. Jinan, confident of victory, was inevitably complacent, and did not field star players like Yin Guiren and Wang Nanzhen. Unexpectedly, Qingguang was still strong. Having posed a great threat to Xintong the night before, they put all their effort into the game last night. As a result, the Jinan team, known as a formidable force, was greatly troubled. In the first half, Qingguang led by two points with a score of 17-15. In the second half, Qingguang led twice again. Jinan caught up to 26-25, 28-25, and 30-27. Qingguang's Lu Dazhen was ejected for four fouls, but there was no replacement. With six minutes remaining, Qingguang played with four players. Ultimately, due to being outnumbered, with only one minute and forty seconds left in the game, Han Zhenyuan was also ejected for four fouls. Regrettably, Liang Guoyang, overexcited, missed the free throw at this valuable opportunity. Consequently, Cai Yanxiong tied the score at 37-37, and the buzzer sounded. After a five-minute overtime, although Qingguang only had four players, they had as many as eight shooting opportunities. Unfortunately, they missed each one by a hair's breadth, gaining nothing. Meanwhile, Jinan's Kuang Yao Ya imitated the old trick of Lan Yin, lurking under the basket. Cai Yanxiong passed from afar, and he tipped the ball in. Within two minutes, in a flash, they increased by six points. Qingguang suffered a disastrous defeat with a score of 37-49.</p>

<h3>Chinese YMCA to Hold Charity Basketball Exhibition Tonight at Sichuan Road</h3>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>National Basic Education in Guangxi in the Last Five Years: Provincial and County Funding Has Increased Annually</h3>
<p>In Guangxi, primary schools have been renamed National Basic Education, which has two important missions. One is the transformation of education itself, making it popular and productive to achieve national revival as the ultimate goal. The other is the transformation of education for society, using education as a tool to complete the tasks of Guangxi's new politics, new economy, new culture, and new society. To actively promote this, a six-year popularization plan was formulated. On the one hand, enrollment was encouraged, and on the other hand, a compulsory education order was promulgated on New Year's Day of the 25th year. The province was divided into eight guidance areas for the popularization of national basic education, each with a guidance committee responsible for guidance and design. Each county was required to establish a central national basic school in each township (or town) and a national basic school in each village (or street). The basic political organization of Guangxi is that the provincial government is divided into eight administrative supervision areas, each governing more than ten counties. Counties are divided into districts, townships (towns in cities), villages (streets in cities), and jia. Ten households form one jia, eight to fifteen jia form one village (street), and eight to fifteen villages form one township (town). The plan aims to universally establish national basic schools in all villages (streets) of the province before July of the 25th year, universally establish central national basic schools in all townships (towns) of the province before July of the 26th year, complete short-term national basic education with a one-year period before July of the 27th year, complete national basic education with a two-year period before July of the 28th year, and complete the preliminary construction work of villages (streets) and townships (towns) throughout the province before July of the 29th year. Among the more than 25,000 villages in Guangxi, according to statistics from July of the 24th year, more than 18,000 national basic schools had been established. The funding is coordinated and allocated by various counties. Generally, the entire funding for central basic schools in townships (towns) comes from county funds, the salaries of teachers and staff in village (street) basic schools are paid by the county, and other expenses are raised by the villages and streets themselves. Since the province implemented universal education, funding has increased annually. The comparison of provincial and county national basic education funding in the most recent five years is as follows:</p>
<p>Based on the above comparison, the 24th year saw the largest increase in funding, with a combined increase of 807,735 yuan from the province and counties.</p>

<h3>Finance Ministry Announces Continued Collection of Income Tax; Banking and Monetary Industries Held Joint Meeting Yesterday; Resolved to Comply and Agreed on Various Collection Procedures; Various Freelance Professional Groups Held Discussions Yesterday</h3>
<p>Following the Finance Ministry's announcement that it would continue collecting income taxes on securities deposits and other items from New Year's Day, the Banking and Monetary Industries Association held a joint meeting yesterday and resolved to comply. Various freelance professional groups held practical research discussions yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Finance Ministry Announcement: Continued Collection</p>
<p>Finance Ministry Announcement No. 186 states: The various income taxes to be continued from January 1, year 26, are listed as follows: Category 1: Income from profit-making enterprises. A. Income from companies, firms, businesses, factories, or individuals with capital of 2,000 yuan or more. B. Income from joint government-business ventures. C. Income from temporary profit-making enterprises. Category 2: Income from salaries and remuneration. Income from salaries and remuneration of freelancers and other professionals. Category 3: Income from securities deposits. Income from company bonds, stocks, and deposit interest. For the above items, the tax rates, calculations, and payment procedures shall be handled in accordance with the Provisional Income Tax Regulations and their implementing rules. In addition to separate orders for handling, a public announcement is made for general knowledge. This announcement is made by Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>Banking and Monetary Industries: Joint Meeting</p>
<p>The Bankers Association held its 19th Executive Committee meeting at its Hong Kong Road location at 5:00 PM yesterday. The Monetary Industry Association was also invited to send representatives to jointly discuss the procedures for implementing income tax. Present were Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunzhai, Li Fusun, Wang Boyuan, Zhang Peishen, Hu Xi'an, Wu Weiru, Du Yuesheng, Song Ziliang (representing Zhang Zhuyu), Pan Jiufen, Qi Yunqing, and others from the Bankers Association Executive Committee; Pei Yunqing and Feng Yigui, representatives from the Monetary Industry Association; and Secretary-General Lin Kanghou in attendance. Chairman Chen Guangfu reported that the Ministry of Finance had decided to implement the first category of income from profit-making enterprises and the second category of income from salaries and remuneration on New Year's Day and requested a joint discussion on various collection procedures. The members expressed their opinions successively and reached an agreement on various collection procedures, resolving to comply with the Ministry's order and implement it as scheduled. Regarding the report of the previous subcommittee, it was also resolved that the two associations would submit contributions of their opinions to the Ministry. The meeting adjourned at 5:40 PM.</p>
<p>Banking Society: Research Report</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society learned yesterday of the Banking Society's second research report abstract on income tax. The section on deposits is as follows: (1) Interbank deposits should be tax-exempt. (Reason) The purpose of interbank deposits is to facilitate fund transfers between banks, which differs from the purpose of ordinary depositors seeking interest. (2) Interest on transactions between head offices and branches should be tax-exempt. (Reason) Banks provide services to society, and there are frequent fund transfers between head offices and branches. This is internal accounting, not ordinary business income. (3) The method for paying income tax on fixed deposits withdrawn in installments and installments paid out as a lump sum should be specified. (Reason) Both of these are settled semi-annually. If income tax is levied on the interest each time it is settled, the former will affect the originally scheduled amount for each installment, and the latter will affect the lump sum due in the future. A method should be devised to remedy this. (4) For various tax-exempt deposits, the bank should declare that it is not responsible for identifying them. (Reason) Article 2, Paragraph 3, Subparagraphs (Zi) (Yin) (Mao) of the regulations stipulate that interest income from funds deposited by government agencies and educational charities is exempt from income tax. However, it is difficult for banks to determine whether this type of deposit matches the actual situation. Depositors should be responsible for this themselves.</p>
<p>Freelance Groups: Hold Discussion</p>
<p>Freelance professional groups held a joint discussion at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Bankers Association on Hong Kong Road. Attendees included Xie Linfu, Jiang Wanping, He Yuanming, and more than ten other representatives from the Lawyers Association, Accountants Association, Chinese Institute of Engineers, Chinese Institute of Architects, National Medical Association, Shanghai Medical Association, Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, and Chinese Medicine Society. They discussed the income tax issue for freelancers. The result was that each association would conduct further practical research, and representatives would be publicly nominated to go to Beijing to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance when necessary.

After returning for ten days, the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred, causing panic throughout the country, and we did not know what to do. I was delighted to learn of your safe return and read your speech in Xi'an, full of sincerity. Even the stubborn were subdued. Because of this incident, the people of the whole country realized that you have worked hard for the country on a daily basis and that you suffered hardships for the public good. This aroused infinite sympathy and made them realize that it is extremely dangerous for the country to be without a leader. Everyone loves and supports you, even more intensely than before. From now on, I only hope that you will continue to work hard for the country, and I hope that all Chinese people, regardless of regional boundaries, regardless of the government or the public, regardless of party affiliation, will love you as patriots, help you as those who love you, love you with virtue, and help you with strength. According to the government's established policy, we will complete the great cause of national rejuvenation. Recalling this year, I have been taught five times by you in Sichuan, Beijing, and Luoyang, and I have written to you four times. I have been increasingly respectful and admiring. Worshipping heroes and protecting leaders is a common sentiment. Who is not like me? As the new year begins, the country's destiny is new.

<h3>Xiang River Floods; Navigation is Fully Open</h3>
<p>Changsha, Hunan, had an early water recession this year. At its shallowest point, the Xiang River had only one foot of water, causing all ships to stop and be unable to pass, only reaching Yuezhou. Goods going to Changsha were mostly accumulated in Hankou and Yuezhou ports. Although there were civilian boats transshipping, the capacity was too small, causing extreme stagnation. The Xiang gang was deeply anxious because the end of the year was approaching. Changsha sent a telegram yesterday reporting that the Xiang River's water level had risen sharply in recent days due to heavy rainfall, increasing to seven feet six inches, and navigation was fully open. Shallow-water ships can travel smoothly. At the request of various guest gangs, all shipping companies have dispatched large barges to Yuezhou to load and enter Hunan with all the goods that are stockpiled there.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Huainan Coal; To Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon; River Water Rises Greatly, Shipping is Smooth</h3>

This city received reliable information yesterday that six ocean-going ships have arrived at Yuxikou to transport a large amount of coal to Shanghai and are being loaded. Within a few days, a large batch of Huainan coal can be loaded and transported to Shanghai to meet the needs of society.</p>

British Economic Envoy to China Rogers traveled with Chen to meet Minister Kong and discuss Sino-British economic matters.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Municipal Public Security Bureau; Name Changed to Police Bureau; Three-Tier System Changed to Two-Tier System</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of reforming the national police system, the Ministry of the Interior has drafted a plan and sent it to the provincial and municipal governments, requiring them to reorganize according to the new plan. According to sources from the Municipal Public Security Authority, this city will also implement reorganization. The name of the Public Security Bureau will be changed to the Police Bureau. At the same time, the current three-tier system will be changed to a two-tier system, that is, the existing police stations will be abolished, and branch bureaus will be established directly under the General Bureau to facilitate command. In the future, branch bureaus will be increased as appropriate, and police forces will also be appropriately strengthened. However, whether the Security Corps will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the police authorities is still under consideration. Therefore, the reorganization of the police administration in this city will be difficult to realize on New Year's Day and will probably occur after January or February.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Long-Distance Telephone; Adds a Pair of Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance telephone business has been developing rapidly in recent years. The original telephone lines are currently being reorganized and will be completed soon.

<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association held its 10th Member Meeting at its Hong Kong Road headquarters at 4:00 PM yesterday, reporting on the handling of association affairs this year and approving the final accounts for this year and the budget for the first half of the 26th year. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members</p>
<p>A total of 109 representatives from 43 member banks, including Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Dalu Bank, Kenye Bank, Silk Industry Bank, Si Ming Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Xinhua Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Real Estate Bank, China Industrial Bank, China National Products Bank, Tonghe Bank, Tongshang Bank, Zhonghui Bank, Quangong Bank, Women's Bank, and others, including Chen Guangfu, Sun Jingxi, Yao Yinpeng, Qin Runqing, Du Yuesheng, Lu Zidong, Wang Boyuan, Fu Xiao'an, Jing Runshi, Wu Yunzhai, Liu Pinsan, Tang Shoumin, Wang Zhixin, Qi Yunqing, Wu Weiru, Xu Xinliu, Hu Bijang, Ye Zhuotang, Wang Shaoxian, Zhu Miaosheng, Li Fusun, Hu Xi'an, Zhang Peishen, Pan Jiufen, Zhang Zhuyu, Bei Songsun, Chen Mutang, Zhang Shulin, and Liu Hongyuan, were present. Secretary-General Lin Kanghou and Recorder Gu Cheng'an were in attendance.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the rituals, Chairman Chen Guangfu reported on the association's affairs since the 11th session: "Looking back, this association was established five years ago, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, succeeding the former Shanghai Bankers Association. Initially, only 28 banks joined, less than three-eighths of the city's banks. The number of member representatives was only over 140. Over the years, there have been additions, and recently there have been 43 members, and the number of representatives has increased to over 170. The foundation is gradually solid, and the responsibilities are heavier. This association handles association affairs with practicality as the main principle. In the past few years, all measures have been based on the country's economic revival policy and the refreshing of the industry's business plan. In these difficult times, there is not much to mention, but the original intention of maintaining the financial bulwark has always been consistent and is well understood by the colleagues present. This year, Chairman Chen Guangfu went abroad for public affairs and returned after half a year. Permanent Committee Member Wu Yunzhai served as acting chairman, handling everything according to the established rules. After the chairman returned to work in early November, a total of eight executive committee meetings, two group meetings, and one joint meeting of the banking and monetary industries were convened during this six-month period. In addition to routine matters that do not need to be repeated, the more important cases handled include the following: Regarding the entry and exit of members, such as the Jiangzhe Bank merging with the Zhonghui Bank for business, a letter was sent requesting the cancellation of membership. The Guangdong Bank has now announced its resumption of business and has also sent a letter requesting to rejoin the list of member banks. The Executive Committee has approved this year and included it in today's agenda, pending ratification by the General Assembly. As for the income tax issue, it was originally scheduled to be implemented in October this year, but the Ministry of Finance approved a postponement of implementation after this association presented it. At the same time, a subcommittee was organized to revise the internal procedures in detail. As this case is a new policy for the 26th year, I will only mention the beginning and will make a systematic report at the next regular meeting. As for the two donations for buying machines to celebrate birthdays and the one-day sports, all banks in this association also strongly supported them, totaling approximately 20,000 yuan or more. There are also opinions on abolishing the current bank guarantee system and unifying the rules for foreign exchange business, which are related to the industry's practical affairs and are being planned for implementation. This can be reported in advance. In addition to publishing a compilation of circulars, this association will further plan to compile books such as association affairs compendiums, which will not only provide convenience for colleagues to investigate at any time, but also provide a consistent description of this association's work. Colleagues are burdened with heavy responsibilities, and there is a deep fear of failure. It is hoped that those colleagues in the city who have not joined the association will help each other in the same boat and come to join successively. Then, the strength will be thick, and the effect will be great. Regarding the promotion of association affairs and the reform of the industry's advantages and disadvantages, we rely more on the feelings of each member, who will give assistance from time to time. Hopefully, we can gather our thoughts and benefit not only the future of this association, which can be expected to progress day by day, but also those in the association. This is not a small matter. On the occasion of convening the annual regular meeting, I have written a few words to record the general outline of the association's affairs in the past six months."</p>
<p>Passing Various Cases</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, the following cases were discussed: (1) The Jiangzhe Commercial Savings Bank's letter requesting to withdraw from the association was passed. (2) The Guangdong Bank's letter requesting to be relisted as a member bank of this association was passed. (3) The Zhejiang Industrial, China Industrial, Zhongfu, Silk Industry, and Zhonghui Banks' letters requesting to replace member representatives were passed. (4) The final accounts for the next session of this association were passed. (5) The budget for the first half of the 26th year was passed. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

Therefore, Mr. Gao was scheduled to go to Nanjing by express train at 11 o'clock last night to report on the results of his inspection. It is said that Mr. Gao is both talented and learned, astute and decisive. He has served as a special military commissioner of the Military Affairs Commission for many years and is deeply trusted by the Chairman.

<h3>Cui Tongyue's Remains Moved to the Central Funeral Home Yesterday; Mayor Wu and Others Attended the Memorial Service; Funeral Scheduled for the 3rd of Next Month</h3>
<p>According to the "Shen Shi News," the passing of the revolutionary pioneer Cui Tongyue (Min) the day before yesterday morning has caused great sorrow among all parties who learned of the news. His remains have now been moved to the Central Funeral Home, and the funeral is scheduled for the 3rd of next month. The funeral committee has reported the death to the Central Party Headquarters and President Sun. The reporter of "Shen Shi News" is now reporting on the various circumstances as follows:</p>
<p>Many Mourners</p>
<p>Mr. Cui's remains were moved to the Central Funeral Home yesterday morning. Those who went to pay their respects included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Central Committee members Xie Chi and Yang Shukan, as well as Mr. Cui's friends Zai Yucheng, Zheng Ziliang, Li Yiqin, Tang Haian, Li Dachao, Cen Xiquan, Zhou Xunyu, Zhuo Wuchu, Gao Fengchi, and many others.</p>
<p>Mr. Cui's Will</p>
<p>"I am old and my health has always been weak. It is a gift from heaven that I have lived to be seventy years old. I regret that I cannot die at the same time with other old comrades who do not covet merit or speak of reward. While in bed, I suddenly heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in distress in Xi'an, which caused me to lose sleep for several nights. Now he has escaped danger and returned to Nanjing, just like when President Sun Yat-sen was in distress at the London Embassy. This is the effect of prayer. However, everything in China goes according to heaven. If we can strive to fight, we will surely exist forever in the world. I hope that all people will unite and overcome this difficulty, so as to achieve the goal of national freedom and liberation in China. Regarding the affairs of establishing the Jianru Library and the Youlie Memorial Hall in the Canghai School, I hope that all colleagues will do their best to carry them out. The Qinian Association has been operating miserably for five years, and has already received two mu of land donated by the founder of the Longhua Orphanage to build a nursing home. It is planned to build a small house on the remaining land in the back so that my wife, Ms. Jiang, can take care of the affairs of the nursing home. The Overseas Chinese Federation and various organizations should cooperate to seek welfare for overseas Chinese and compatriots. My lifelong aspirations and experiences are all described in detail in the two books, 'Canghai's Life' and 'Collection of Poems'. Now that the country is in serious trouble, the funeral should be frugal and do not waste the time and money of relatives, friends, and comrades." Cui Tongyue's will, 25, 12, 27, afternoon. Recorded by Xie Zitian, Cen Xiquan, Shen Zuoliang, Jiang Min, Cui Aiying, Cui Boyi, Lai Yinlin, Wei Jianwei.</p>

The most serious ones, such as Honggeertu, Xinaobao, Sanyanjing, and Dajiangou, were either attacked and looted, or bombed by airplanes, heavy artillery, poison gas, tanks, and other sharp weapons. The number of villagers poisoned and killed is countless. The destruction of all buildings and the looting of grain and property, in some cases the entire village was emptied. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. Now, refugees in various places are displaced, crying for food and shivering in the ice and snow, which is extremely miserable.

We earnestly hope that you will be generous and give relief. We are extremely hopeful. A special telegram is sent to you."

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Public Information Office Closes: Report Submitted by Qian Bohan, Head of Chinese Information</h3>
<p>As the Municipal Council's Public Information Office is about to close, it is currently in the process of finalizing matters. Recently, Chairman Arnold and Director-General Felippu sent letters to the Public Information Office, thanking the Chinese, English, and Japanese directors for their past service. It is also reported that Qian Bohan, the head of Chinese Information, has submitted the 1936 work report to the Director-General's Office. This report is also the final report of the Public Information Office in the five years since its establishment. The following is a summary of the main points: A total of more than 440 Chinese information items were issued this year. More than 160 Chinese newspaper reviews and records were translated into English for reference by the board and relevant departments. The Chinese information issued by the Public Information Office, due to its close relationship with various Chinese newspapers and news agencies, was readily published, benefiting the authorities greatly. For example, the effective publicity of sanitation matters has been of great benefit to both the authorities and the citizens. As for the comments on bureau affairs in Chinese newspapers, although the Chinese citizens are gradually paying more attention to the bureau's administration, the opinions published in newspapers still lack a consistent policy and only discuss individual accidental events in a passive manner. Active and systematic contributions are still rare. As for the most reported events in Chinese newspapers this year, the rickshaw issue and the shantytown issue occupied a very prominent position. Other issues such as cross-border road construction and factory inspection were also frequently reported. However, major issues with news value, such as disputes caused by election errors, and the financial situation and austerity issues related to the interests of all citizens, were significantly less reported and criticized than in foreign newspapers. Other events that could be pursued, such as the telephone issue, were still being debated at the beginning of the year. In the summer, the Police Department's ban on patriotic dramas being performed in the concession also caused fierce criticism for a time.</p>
<h3>Indian Police Officer to Be Hanged for Murder: Rope Breaks, Neck Not Broken; Law Seems to Indicate No Re-execution; Possible Pardon or Commutation; Indian Officer Not Dead But Suffers Concussion</h3>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that Indian police officer Atma Singh, who was sentenced to be hanged for killing Indian police officer Bawa Singh of the Putuo Road Police Station on October 19th, was to be executed at the Ward Road Prison at 7:00 AM this morning (29th). Unexpectedly, the executioner placed the noose around the convict's neck, pulled him up to the gallows, raised him to nine or ten feet, and the rope suddenly broke in the middle. The convict fell to the ground, but his neck was not broken. The attending officials were all horrified. This is rare in the history of executing criminals in Shanghai and the world. It is said that the execution rope had been tested last night and was very strong. It is unknown why it broke this morning. British Consul General to Shanghai, Sir Brenan, telegraphed British Ambassador to Peiping, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, upon hearing the news. He also plans to go to Ward Road Prison tomorrow morning to investigate the truth. The convict did not die after falling to the ground, but suffered a concussion. He is now lying in the police station hospital. His final fate is currently uncertain. Many believe that a person who has been hanged should not be hanged again according to the law. In the past, convicts who were executed but did not die were often granted leniency. Sir Brenan is currently awaiting instructions from the British Ambassador on how to deal with the person, whether to grant him a pardon or a commutation. It is heard that the convict suffered a severe concussion, which may lead to his death. Ward Road prison officials are currently tight-lipped about the matter. When asked about the convict's condition, they replied that they did not know and suggested inquiring at the British Consulate. Reuters Peiping, 29th, reports that British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen has decided to commute the death sentence of Indian Atma Singh, the convict who was not killed when the rope broke during his execution in Shanghai this morning. Although the Ambassador's decision has not yet been announced, it is expected that the convict will have his sentence commuted to life imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Briton Knox Attacked: Hoodlums Ambush on Ou Jia Road: Badly Injured by Acid</h3>
<p>A Briton, Knox, (transliteration), a foreman at the Shanghai Water Company on Yangshupu Road, residing at 2 Mcgarry Road, Ti Si Wei Road, finished work yesterday afternoon and hired a rickshaw with the Shanghai City license plate number 1544 to return home. While passing the entrance of Lane 917 on Ou Jia Road, a thug, about 30 years old, suddenly jumped out of the opposite Zhe Xing Lane, stopped the rickshaw, and splashed nitric acid he was carrying on Knox's head. Knox's eyes were severely injured. The thug fled without a trace. The Ti Si Wei Road Police Station immediately ordered Western Detective Maya, together with the police, to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate. A piece of yellow paper used to wipe the nitric acid was found and taken back to the police station for investigation and apprehension of the culprit. The injured was sent to the Public Hospital, and there is a risk that he may lose his eyesight. Judging from the circumstances of the attack, it seems to be due to a feud.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Rampant: Vaccination Advised: Discussion with Director Li of the Health Bureau</h3>
<p>Li Ting'an, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, is paying particular attention to the recent smallpox epidemic. He said that smallpox is an acute infectious disease caused by direct contact with patients or infection with their secretions. Children are particularly vulnerable, with a mortality rate of about 20%, which is frightening to mention. Few smallpox cases were found in Shanghai in October and November, one in October and two in November. However, it has been particularly rampant this month. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, it has admitted as many as 33 patients. This is due to the large population of Shanghai and the constant movement of people. The prevention method is early vaccination with cowpox. Both children and adults should be vaccinated. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's health stations in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Gaoqiao, and other districts, as well as the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital and the Municipal Hunan Hospital (formerly Shanghai Hospital), can all provide free vaccinations. To facilitate the public, 22 institutions, including Southeast Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Xin Puyu Hall, Sino-German Hospital, Pingmin Free Clinic, Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, Women and Children's Hospital, Emergency Epidemic Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, Huxi Commune, Waterside Pavilion Clinic, Pudong Hospital, Municipal Public Education Center, Children's Free Clinic, Taizhou Hospital, Pushan Hospital, Labor Hospital, Lianyi Western Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, and Second and Third Hospitals, and Hunan People's Maternity Hospital, have been designated as vaccination distribution points. Opportunities are available everywhere, so please do not miss them. If there are groups of 30 or more people, you can send a letter directly to the Municipal Health Bureau, and they will send personnel to vaccinate.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Coins: Organization Cracked: Models Seized: Several Arrested</h3>
<p>Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, along with detective Yang Xinzheng and officer Chen Jinsheng, learned that Zhang Jinrong, the owner of the Hexing Printing House at 10 Lane 778, Peng Road, was involved in counterfeiting Farmers Bank 20-cent coins. They secretly raided the place at 8:40 PM the day before yesterday. While passing near North Jiangxi Road on Haining Road, they arrested a suspect, Zhang Jingkang from Anhui, and found a copper model of the reverse side of a Farmers Bank 20-cent coin, already mounted on wood. Detective Shao remained calm and went directly to the organization, where they arrested Yang Ganxiang from Pinghu, Zhu Fengtang from Haimen, Xu Fugao from Danyang, Yang Shaokang from Yunnan, apprentices Shen Jusheng from Wuxi, Qiang Baishun, Chen Xiangwen from Zhapu, and others. However, no other evidence was found. The owner, Zhang Jinrong, is on the run. They were all taken to the police station for detention and then sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and requested an extension. A copper model was presented for inspection. Sun Derong, a representative of the Farmers Bank, testified that the model was of the third type of 20-cent coin, and that counterfeit coins had previously been found circulating in the market and had been destroyed. Zhang Jingkang, when questioned, said that he was a runner in the Hexing Printing House and that a friend, Qiu Wenxiang, had contacted him beforehand. The model was made by the owner, Zhang Jinrong. He made evasive replies. Yang Ganxiang said that the matter was done by Zhang Jingkang and the owner, that the model for the front side had not been made, and that he was not a shareholder. Xu Fugao said that he was a carpenter at the shop and knew nothing about it. Zhu Fengtang said that Zhang Jinrong had asked him to photograph the reverse side model presented in court and that the front side was not photographed. Yang Shaokang and the apprentices Shen Jusheng, Qiang Baishun, and Chen Xiangwen all claimed that they knew nothing about the matter. Judge Zhong Qing ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>
<h3>Girl Accuses Father of Abandonment</h3>
<p>Zhu Yueming, a 24-year-old woman from Jinhua, Zhejiang, residing at 1 Renhe Lane, Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, sued Zhang Jinghui, a 26-year-old man from Zhuji, Zhejiang, residing at Xinxin Lane, Luban Road, in the local court, for abandoning their daughter, Zhang Zijin, and requested confirmation of the father-daughter relationship and monthly alimony of 10 yuan. The daughter, acting as the plaintiff, stated that the defendant, in the third month of the lunar calendar in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], used his position (supervisor in a silk factory) and employed methods of threat and enticement, resulting in forced sexual relations with her mother. As a result, she became pregnant and gave birth to the plaintiff on December 11th of the same year. However, the defendant was as cruel as a wolf and, while her mother was bedridden, fled without a trace, leaving the plaintiff and her mother in dire straits. Until November 11th of this year at 9:00 AM, the defendant was seen by her mother walking in Nanshi, and she was immediately handed over to the City Public Security Bureau, which transferred him to the Prosecutor's Office. Because the statute of limitations had expired and it was a civil matter, they now request confirmation of the father-daughter relationship and an order for monthly alimony of 10 yuan in national currency. Yesterday, Judge Chen held a court session. The defendant did not appear, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Order: Strictly Prohibit Depressing the Price of Subsidiary Currency; Stop Exchange Shops from Taking Advantage of the Year-End Period and Manipulating Exchange Rates Arbitrarily, Disregarding Regulations.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association issued a public notice in the market yesterday stating: "Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Order No. 7802, which states: 'Based on reports from citizens, it is found that the Ministry of Finance's currency reform, which stipulates the value of silver dollars, truly benefits the people and prevents merchants from manipulating prices, has been clearly promulgated. However, recently, various exchange shops in the city have disregarded regulations, vigorously implementing their old methods. Every year-end approaches, they depress the price of silver dollars, with fluctuations of even twenty or thirty coins. At a time when people's livelihoods are difficult, these unscrupulous merchants are so inhumane and violate the promulgated orders. If they are not strictly stopped, they will become even more unscrupulous in the future.' Based on this, it is found that recently the exchange rate of national currency has suddenly fallen, and the exchange rates of copper coins, subsidiary currency, and small silver coins are not in accordance with regulations. The various exchange shops are suspected of manipulation. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the Association to investigate and stop this, and report back for verification. Furthermore, every year before the year-end settlement period in the city, the price of silver dollars is bound to fall, affecting citizens, which is no small matter. Since the currency reform, exchange rates have been stable, and the aforementioned situation should not occur again. As the year-end approaches, methods should be devised in advance to prevent this. The Association is hereby ordered to comply with this order and report back as necessary.' Having received this, it is found that our Association's members have never engaged in exchange business. In addition to submitting a reply, this notice is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Secretary of the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors" Group, Wang Zixiang, Questioned Yesterday; Police Present a Letter; Wang Has Admitted to Writing It.</h3>
<p>Wang Zixiang, the secretary of the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors" Group, was apprehended by the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau and then escorted to Shanghai by Lang Jin'an, a Chinese detective from the Shanghai Old Zha Police Station, to be interrogated and detained by the Special First Court. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial in the first criminal court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao'yi, prosecuted him for disrupting public order under Article 154 of the Criminal Code, and stated that Wang Zixiang served as a clerk in the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors" Group. In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), when the police apprehended Pan Hongsheng and others in connection with the bombing case and sent them to the court for trial, the chief officer of the Public Works Department received a letter on December 18 of that year, purportedly from the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors" Group, stating that Pan and others committed the crime out of patriotism and requesting favorable treatment. It also stated that only British and Japanese goods were prevalent in Shanghai and that banning Japanese goods would greatly benefit British goods. The handwriting of the letter was consistent with Wang's written confession and other letters, which proved that Wang was indeed a member of the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors" Group and should be punished according to law. When questioned, Wang Zixiang claimed that the letter was drafted by Wang Tiemin, who then ordered him to write it, claiming that it was for public organizations to rescue patriotic heroes, so he wrote it on their behalf. However, he absolutely denied joining the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors" Group and hired Wu Linkun as his lawyer. Judge Feng ordered a postponement of the judgment.</p>
<h3>Lending Money at Usurious Rates and Committing Assault</h3>
<p>Zhu Hongchen, a peddler from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 1, Sanjia Village, Pudong, makes a living by selling olives. This summer, due to financial difficulties and a lack of capital, he asked Zhong Detai (from Xinghua) to act as a guarantor and borrowed two silver dollars from Meng Shiguang, a Gaoyou native who specializes in lending money at usurious rates. He had to pay eight copper coins per day in interest (commonly known as "rubber ball money"). The interest would only stop once the principal of two silver dollars was repaid. However, business was poor, resulting in an accumulation of 480 copper coins in interest owed. Around 9 pm the night before, Meng demanded the interest from Zhu but was unable to obtain it, so he dragged Zhu out and beat him severely, causing serious injuries. The police arrived and took Meng to the station. Due to the case involving usurious lending and assault, he was transferred to the Public Security Bureau yesterday for investigation.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Company Holds Founding Meeting in Shanghai; Board of Directors and Supervisors Re-elected in Further Meeting</h3>
<p>Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Co., Ltd., with a projected capital stock of 1 million yuan, most of which has been raised, held its founding meeting at 4 PM the day before yesterday in the auditorium of the World Society on Foch Road. Eighty-five shareholders attended, including Li Shizeng, Du Chongyuan, Hu Xiyuan, Cai Shengbai, and Wu Yun'chu. Li Shizeng was publicly elected as chairman, and after delivering an opening speech, Du Chongyuan, the founder, reported that the company's preparations had taken over two years, and he apologized for the delay due to personal matters. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic support of various sectors, sufficient capital stock was raised. He was grateful for the shareholders' enthusiastic attendance today. Yang Zhiping then reported on the preparations, stating that the stock payments had been received before the year, but due to financial instability, foreign exchange was purchased and deposited in other ports. Subsequently, the government implemented the legal tender policy, so the foreign exchange was sold and deposited in the Central Trust Bureau of China Bank and other local banks, earning about 70,000 yuan in interest. After deducting 50,000 yuan for dividends and over 16,000 yuan for preparatory expenses, there was still a surplus of over 4,000 yuan, which was never used. For the capital stock factory building, four original kilns and two bisque kilns, as well as material warehouses, totaling 1,100 square meters, were built. The construction, including purchasing materials and hiring workers, cost about 110,000 yuan. Construction began on July 15 of this year and is now two-thirds complete. It is expected to be completed in January next year and production will begin in April. Half of the machinery was purchased first, produced by the China Iron Works in Shanghai, and has already been shipped for installation. If the initial production results are good, the remaining parts will be purchased. The generator is an old 300-horsepower machine purchased from the Jiangwan Power Plant and will be shipped within days. The 100-mu factory site is located at the former Anglican Church site at the East Gate of Jiujiang and the vacant prison land, the latter of which was purchased for 8,000 yuan. The company's articles of association were then approved, and directors and supervisors were elected. However, since the Jiangxi Province representatives, including three directors and one supervisor from the province's official shares, had not yet been appointed, it was requested that the election be postponed. This was unanimously approved, and a meeting will be held after the provincial government appoints them to elect them and report to the Ministry of Industry for formal establishment.</p>

<h3>Gao Changfu Suffers Threats and Kidnapping, Five-Month-Old Baby Sacrificed; Refusal to Pay 200 Yuan Ransom Leads to Discovery of Baby's Body in Cesspool</h3>
<p>Gao Changfu, a 40-year-old local from No. 27, Gujiazhai, Hongzhen, Zhabei, works as a clerk at the Xindali Foreign Firm in this city. On October 9th, he suddenly received a threatening letter from bandits demanding 2,000 yuan. Gao ignored it, believing he was not wealthy. Unexpectedly, at 9 AM on the 23rd of this month, bandits broke into his bedroom and kidnapped his five-month-old son, Xingyin, from his cradle. Since then, there has been no news from the bandits. Until yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the child was discovered in a cesspool behind Gujiazhai, Hongbo, having been murdered.

Gao, considering the incident to be unusual and startling, has requested the relevant police station to investigate and apprehend the criminals, to seek justice and suppress the banditry.</p>
<h3>Young Woman and Paramour Accused of Falsely Accusing Indian Constable of Rape; Content Untrue, Incomplete, and Extremely Obscene; Case Still Under Investigation, Continued Hearing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Xu Bao'shi, a 21-year-old young woman from Nanjing residing at No. 1340, Rue Robert, Shanghai West, and her paramour, Xu Jinhui, from Xuzhou, were detained the night before last on suspicion of falsely accusing Indian Constable No. 356 from Santoutou, Xinzha Police Station, of rape. West Detective Bao Tai, Chinese Detective Ding Huaguo, and others investigated and confirmed the allegations. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Public Works Department filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 169 of the Criminal Code, charging them with false accusation.</p>
<p>The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, then presented the case, stating that at approximately 9 PM last night, the defendants Xu Bao'shi and Xu Jinhui, accompanied by a Chinese constable from No. 1441, reported to the Xinzha Police Station. According to Xu and others, they resided on Rue Robert. At around 8:30 PM, they went out on foot to buy scarves on Stone Road. Xu Bao'shi suddenly felt an urgent need to relieve herself. As the Huangjiasha Garden area was sparsely populated and</p>
<p>the lights were dim,</p>
<p>she went into an alley to urinate. Unexpectedly, three Indians suddenly dragged her into an empty house at No. 14, where one of the Indians raped her. The police verified the confession and sent Xu Dou'shi to the hospital for examination to confirm the rape, but there was no evidence of rape. Shortly after, she identified Indian Constable No. 356 as the rapist. The police inquired with Indian Constable No. 356, who claimed that at around 8 PM last night, he was on duty at the intersection of Avenue Road and Baibaige Road when Xu Jinhui</p>
<p>solicited business</p>
<p>from him, saying that there was a young and beautiful Chinese woman (referring to Xu Dou'shi) available. The constable replied that he was interested but was on duty at the time and would talk about it after his shift. At 8:30 PM, the Indian constable went off duty and went to No. 14, Huangjiasha Garden with Xu Dou'shi, stating that it would cost 1 yuan per hour. As No. 14 was an empty house, Gatekeeper Indian Constable No. 45 was temporarily residing on the second floor. Midway through, he saw Gatekeeper No. 45 and Indian Constable No. 521</p>
<p>talking</p>
<p>, so Indian Constable No. 356 told No. 45 that he wanted to borrow his bedroom as a temporary "balcony." After receiving permission, they went together. Indian Constable No. 356 then had relations with Xu Dou'shi. After about 20 minutes, the constable gave her five single-cent nickel coins. The police found half a yuan in nickel coins on Xu Jinhui. Later, Indian Constable No. 45 told the police that he had also had</p>
<p>relations</p>
<p>with Xu on a previous occasion, in Room 2 of the Sanyi Inn at No. 103, Shunde Road. The police went to the inn and found a record in the register for Room 2 on the 8th of this month, opened by a "Red Ah San," and the teaboy Liu Qinglian could identify her as having stayed with the constable. In addition, Indian Constables No. 705 and No. 130 also reported to the police that Xu Jinhui had previously solicited them as customers and they had stayed with her in Room 24 of the Zhonghua Xin Inn on Avenue Road. Therefore, according to the</p>
<p>above circumstances,</p>
<p>there was no rape. The two defendants, intending to subject another person to criminal punishment, made a false accusation to the police and should be investigated. Indian Constable No. 356 also stated that he had sexual relations with Xu Bao'shi through Xu Jinhui's introduction, stating at the time that it would cost 1 yuan per hour. He only gave her half a yuan because it was only 20 minutes. He had also had</p>
<p>sexual relations</p>
<p>with her once before in September of this year at No. 14.</p>
<p>When questioned, Xu Dou'shi still claimed that she had urinated in Huangjiasha Garden the night before and was dragged into the upper floor of No. 14 by three Indians, one of whom forced himself on her. Afterwards, they forced half a yuan in nickel coins into her pocket, which she gave to her husband. She denied everything else. Judge Huang Risheng, considering that the case still required investigation, ordered the two defendants to be detained and re-examined on the 31st of this month.</p>

<h3>Russian Gang of Thieves Planned to Rob in Songjiang; Had Reconnoitered Routes; Court Questioned Them Once Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Central Police Station's Chinese and Western detectives recently arrested seven Russian thieves, including Bao Shafu, and confiscated five pistols, over 180 rounds of ammunition, a car, and forged car licenses, among other items. They were handed over to the First Special District Local Court for investigation, as reported in previous newspapers. Investigators have now determined that the Russians went to Songjiang in April and May of this year with the intention of robbing the branch of the Bank of China and the pawnshop there. Therefore, based on the final paragraph of Article 328 of the Criminal Code (attempted robbery) and Article 187 (illegal possession of military firearms), a public prosecution was initiated. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ma ordered Bao Shafu, Na Baofu, Livenf, Ke Shiduo, Maimikang, Di Ketuo, Paikefu, and the other seven defendants to be brought before the court for questioning. The police lawyer, Ru Bao'yi Feng, stated that the defendants had repeatedly traveled to Songjiang, ostensibly to withdraw remittances from the Bank of China branch there, but in reality, they were taking the opportunity to observe the interior of the bank and the routes of entry and exit in order to plan the robbery. Photographs and other items were presented as evidence. After Judge Feng examined them and questioned each of the defendants individually, he ordered them to be returned to detention and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<h3>The Main Culprit in the Attempted Assassination Case, Yuan Youlin, Also Arrested: Tried Together with Accomplices, Yuan Admits to Murder</h3>
<p>Yuan Youlin, a well-known gangster who occupies an evil influence in the Xieqiao area of ​​Nanshi, is thirty-four years old, has a large number of followers, and specializes in extortion and blackmail. He had a deep grudge with Zhang Rongsheng (resident of No. 19 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, a detective of the French police force who has been suspended from his duties). On August 15 of this year, he led his disciples, carrying six axes and one six-round pistol, to Linyuan Teahouse at No. 682 Beile Road to attempt to murder Zhang Rongsheng. His accomplices Niu Dalang and Jiang Wenjin were arrested by the French police and sent to the Second Special Court for trial. Jiang was sentenced to two years in prison, and Niu was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. At the same time, the police investigated and arrested the accomplices who were on the run. On the 19th of this month, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Chengdu Road Police Station of the Public Concession arrested eight bandits, Zhu Wenxiu (i.e., Shi Jinbao), Jia Shenggen, Gong Yilin, Huang Hezhi, Shi Baosheng, Huang Jianglang, Gong Yongjiang, Huang Songquan, etc., in Room 27 of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road, and confiscated a lotus-shaped pistol.

The French police sent detectives to transfer the eight criminals, including Zhu, to be brought to justice. At about 9:00 PM the night before, French police inspector Jiang Futian, detective Xie Guangming, and detectives Dai Rongji and Weng Huanzhang were on official business and passed the intersection of Guangxi Road on Sanma Road in the British Concession when they ran into Yuan Youlin, the main culprit in the failed murder of Zhang Rongsheng.

Yesterday, Yuan and the eight criminals, including Zhu, were taken to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Yao Judi requested an extension of the investigation to be tried together with the Shi Gengquan case. After review and report by Judge Sun Pengxian, Yuan Youlin, Zhu Wenxiu, and Jia Shenggen confessed to attempting to murder Zhang Rongsheng, while the others denied involvement.

<h3>Shanghai Neon Light Manufacturing Industry, Edited by China Credit Information Service, A General Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, Part 41</h3>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>In modern times, commercial competition is becoming increasingly fierce. All sectors of industry and commerce are competing to attract customers with novel advertisements. In recent years, the progress of advertising techniques has been rapid, with constant innovation. The invention of neon lights can be said to be a major development in advertising techniques. Today, almost all major cities in the world have this charming purple-blue installation. This is not only an advertising tool for stores, but also an embellishment for the night scene of the city. The Americans call it "the eyes of the night god," and its moving depth is almost imaginable.</p>
<p>Neon light is called Neon Light in English. It was first invented in the German medical field and was originally called "Violet Light" Vio. It was used for the treatment of diseases and, like sun lamps, was an electrotherapy device for treating diseases. Later, a French person modified it and used it as an advertising tool, because its light was beautiful and eye-catching, and everyone who saw it praised it. However, its patent rights have been sold to the American K. Wm. Cloude, so it is also called Colud Neon Luminous Tubing. Some say that it was invented by the American Cloude, which is probably a patent error. However, the Dutch also claim that it was invented by their own people, and to this day, foreign merchants are not allowed to manufacture and operate it in the Netherlands and its territories. Therefore, there are still different opinions about the inventor, and it is impossible to verify. However, judging from the intention, the former should be more credible.</p>
<p>Neon lights are chemically called "neon" or "ne," and the Chinese translation includes the transliterations "Nian Hong" and "Re Hong," and also "Ne Guang." Currently, the name "neon" is more common.</p>
<p>II. History</p>
<p>The first neon light installation in Shanghai was the Royel fountain pen advertisement at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, which was around 1928. However, the production at that time was not perfect, and there was often a rustling sound, but the people of Shanghai were all amazed by it! When passing by, they would always look up at it. Later, an Italian gentleman set up a factory in Shanghai to manufacture it, but due to limited financial resources and a small scope, coupled with the high cost and the inability to lower the price, the business was not prosperous and soon disappeared. In 1929, Americans RE. Lunkley and others raised US$200,000 to open Cloude Neon Lights, Fed. aInc. U.S.A., in Shanghai, with the factory located at No. 89 Baker Road. Because its products were excellent, and it was also the time of Shanghai's economic prosperity, larger foreign merchants competed to install them, and neon lights in Shanghai shone brightly. However, not many Chinese people installed them at this time.</p>
<p>Later, some foreigners and Chinese people Wan Houji, Shen Lingfang, etc., initiated the organization of the Xinguang Neon Company. Zhang Hualian, the son of former financial decision-maker Zhang Shouyong, initiated the organization of the Meideng Neon Company. Zhou Jiasheng, Cai Guomin, and Yi Jingfu organized the Ziguang Electrical Advertisement Manufacturing Factory. Shanghai's industry gradually increased. However, because the capital of each factory was relatively small and the scope was not large, there were still limited Chinese merchants in Shanghai who were willing to pay high prices for this advertisement, so development was more difficult. However, at that time, it already showed a prosperous trend. This can be said to be the initial stage of the neon light manufacturing industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1930, engineering giants Zhang Huikang, Ren Shigang, Chen Junwu, Luo Qingfan, etc., raised 60,000 yuan to open the Dongfang Nianhong Company, which was initially located next to the Commercial Press on Shishan Road. In addition to manufacturing neon lights, it could also manufacture glass tubes itself. This was the largest Chinese-owned company. Although its capital was still far behind Lian, its business development was enough to compete with Lian. In the same year, the newly opened Huade Bulb Factory, Fulaisheng Bulb Factory, etc., also produced neon lights. Later, Tongming, Great Shanghai, Great East, Datong, Lihua, Guangming, etc., factories were successively opened. At this time, the total number of companies in Shanghai was no less than 40. This can be said to be the prosperous era of the industry. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Vendors Causing Trouble for Police: Police File Lawsuit, Prosecuting Under the Articles of Obstructing Official Business, Police Believe Shooting Was Justifiable Self-Defense</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that fruit vendors gather in the Nanjing Road-Shanxi Road area every morning, obstructing traffic, the Laoza Police Station dispatched Chinese Constable No. 290 Wang Shirong to drive them away the morning before. After receiving the order, the constable rushed to the scene and ordered the vendors to move their loads away. All the vendors obeyed and left, except for one fruit vendor, Huang Fugen from Jiangyin, who refused to obey and uttered abusive words, insulting and scolding the constable. The constable planned to take Huang to the police station, but Huang actually</p>
<p>Held the Constable Back</p>
<p>And punched him. At that time, many vendors near the area gathered upon hearing the sound, and all were unfavorable to the constable, punching and kicking him. Huang even picked up a large stone and tried to throw it at the constable's head. Fortunately, Zuo Lai, a rickshaw puller, saw it from the side and stepped forward to snatch the stone. Huang was still unwilling and suddenly rushed to the constable, grabbed the constable's gun belt, and tried to snatch his gun. For self-defense, the constable took out his gun, and because at this time</p>
<p>There Were Too Many People and Hands</p>
<p>Accidentally touched the trigger. Two bullets were fired, hitting Huang's right leg and Li Xisheng You Xiaochuanzi's left leg, a passerby. The gathered vendors, seeing that a disaster had been caused, scattered like birds and beasts. At that time, Constable No. 312 of the Zhonghe Bank guard at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road also heard the sound and rushed to the scene to help Constable No. 290 arrest Huang and Chen Fanglin from Ningbo who was at the scene, and sent the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>After the Police Station Received the Report</p>
<p>It dispatched Chinese Detective Li Ruiqing to investigate the scene. At that time, Shi Heqing from Ningbo, who lived at No. 226 Tianjin Road, said that he had witnessed the entire situation. The detective brought him to the police station. Constable No. 290 and watchman No. 312 identified Shi as also being a perpetrator at the scene, so Shi was immediately detained as well.</p>
<p>Under Investigation by the Police Station</p>
<p>It was determined that the incident was caused by the violent actions of Huang and others, and that the constable's shooting was justifiable self-defense. Therefore, Huang Fugen, Chen Fanglin, and Shi Heqing were detained and sent to the Criminal Division 2 of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation and prosecuted under Articles 135 and 136 of the Criminal Code for</p>
<p>Obstructing Official Business</p>
<p>And stated that Huang Fugen was in the hospital due to injuries and could not attend court, so he requested permission to reschedule the hearing. Subsequently, witness Zuo Lai and watchman No. 312 proved what had happened. When Chen Fanglin and Shi Heqing were questioned, they both denied beating the Chinese constable. After review by Judge Pan Zhenyang, he ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for one week.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Special Issue</p>
<h3>A Review of the "National Goods Year for Citizens"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>In the rapidly passing flow of time, our "National Goods Year for Citizens" has quickly come to an end.</p>
<p>Now that the end of the year is approaching, we should also review and settle accounts for this year's national goods movement. We know that review is very important, as it can point out past shortcomings, and also show past strengths, so that we can re-determine future plans and continue to move forward.</p>
<p>This year's national goods movement has obviously been carried out through very arduous struggles, because of the continuous efforts of our many entrepreneurs and those who are enthusiastically engaged in the national goods movement, which has ultimately enabled the entire development of national goods to make considerable progress, especially the slight increase in exports, the reduction of import surpluses, the increase in the total turnover of general manufacturers, and the improvement in foreign trade. This gratifying trend has now been proven by facts.</p>
<p>As for the concrete facts - in this year's progress of our national goods, we can first mention the organization of the Nanyang inspection delegation this summer, which went to various parts of Nanyang for on-the-spot inspections, publicity, and promotion. It has opened up a considerable foundation for domestic products in overseas markets, such as the holding of family visits, which indicates that the promotion of national goods is becoming more practical and active. What is most worth mentioning is of course the preparation of the National National Goods Joint-Venture Company. The establishment of this nationwide planned and organized production and sales organization not only shows the enterprising spirit of our national goods industry and the government's determination to maintain domestic production, but also reflects our promising and hopeful national goods future.</p>
<p>Although there were still many obstacles to the national goods movement this year, the biggest ones were rampant smuggling and the continued fierce dumping of foreign goods. We still need to make greater efforts, especially to reduce the import of a large number of imported luxury goods, which is what we should do immediately.</p>
<p>The "National Goods Year for Citizens" has only a few days left. I dare to make a final five-minute appeal, wishing everyone not only to have the passion of nostalgia, bitterness, and roar for this year, but also to work hard for the promising next year as soon as possible!</p>
<p>A word of contribution</p>
<h3>The Prevalence of the Use of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation commissioned Ms. Lu Lihua to investigate and promote the national goods movement in the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Ms. Lu spent more than twenty days traveling to important cities in the four provinces, and contacted local party and government agencies and local women's circles. She received enthusiastic support from comrades in various places, who organized associations to use national goods or advocated national goods movements. According to Ms. Lu's observation, the national goods movement in various places can be said to be universally developed, and the leaders are also working tirelessly. However, there are regrets:</p>
<p>(1) The authorities have failed to provide full support.</p>
<p>(2) Financial difficulties make it difficult to implement established plans.</p>
<p>(3) Some of the work is not practical.</p>
<p>(4) The national goods movements in various places have different organizations and confusing names, and cannot be linked together to carry out expanded movement work.</p>
<p>Based on Ms. Lu's impressions, she believes that the promotion of national goods should have four steps.</p>
<p>(1) Investigate the local production and consumption of national goods.</p>
<p>(2) Promote the practical improvement of national goods products.</p>
<p>(3) Enable people to develop the ability to distinguish between national goods and non-national goods.</p>
<p>(4) Universally promote national goods. At the same time, the names and organizations should be unified, and a supreme agency should be established nationwide to oversee its success. Branch associations should be established at the provincial, city, county, and township levels, so that the system is clear, the organization is unified, and the power is consistent, so that the effect of fingers and arms can be achieved. Annual activity plans should be established and implemented step by step.</p>
<p>The prevalence of the use of national goods in various places is a very good sign for the 25th year of the Republic of China. At the end of this year, it is especially gratifying. The reporter believes that the future development and progress of national goods are unlimited. The other day, Mr. Li Zuyu showed me his translated article on the progress of the national goods movement in Japan. We feel that the situation in the Eastern neighbor more than ten years ago is exactly the same as the situation in our country today. With the full support of the government, the unanimous use of national goods by the people, the seriousness of the inspection work, the efforts of technical personnel, and the mutual encouragement of all parties in society, they have achieved today's self-sufficiency and no need to seek external help. Today, our country is united from top to bottom, with the goal of restoring rights and interests through the use of national goods. In less than ten years, the results will be considerable. What Ms. Lu has stated can be gradually realized. At the end of the year, I will briefly describe the general situation and express my infinite hope.</p>
<h3>Farewell! "National Goods Year for Citizens"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Time flies! The National Goods Year for Citizens has only two days left! The author once wrote words to welcome its arrival, and now that it is leaving, I cannot help but feel attached! Although the achievements of the National Goods Year for Citizens cannot give us a satisfactory impression, the National Exhibition and the National Goods Women's Visit are promoting the National Goods Movement, which is increasing day by day. The regret is only for a few numb and unfeeling traitors and foreign slaves who love to use foreign goods! And most people have a deeper understanding of the two words "national goods"! This is even more evident in the shoulder-to-shoulder customers of the China National Goods Company. Next year, I heard that it will be named "National Goods Year for Civil Servants." Then, the Civil Servants' highest leader, the Minister of Industry, will lead the promotion of the "National Goods Joint-Venture Company" business, which will surely have brilliant and great success! Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, although the "National Goods Year for Citizens" has passed, our responsibility to use national goods is just beginning!</p>
<h3>You Should Think Like This When Buying New Year Items</h3>
<p>— Wei Ji</p>
<p>The New Year is coming soon, and everyone is busy shopping for gifts and selecting goods! However, at a time when national goods are being vigorously promoted, we should generally think like this before selecting goods:</p>
<p>...If the gifts to be bought and given away are foreign goods, will the recipients not say that I do not know goods and do not love the country?</p>
<p>Buying foreign goods is not adding a leakage to the country; buying national goods is not adding a share of production to the country?</p>
<p>Giving foreign goods to people will make people feel sorry, but giving national goods to people will be welcomed respectfully. The New Year is full of joy, and of course, the gifts should be welcomed by people!</p>
<p>In fact, for many of the same items, it is just a psychological effect to like foreign goods; national goods are much better! Then why wouldn't I buy them!</p>
<p>National goods emphasize practicality, while foreign goods emphasize appearance. For things that we eat and use ourselves, we don't seek appearance, but only practicality.</p>
<p>It is the duty of every citizen to strive to buy national goods.</p>
<p>Promoting national goods should be done by setting an example and promoting it from oneself to others; if I buy national goods, others will also follow me to buy national goods, and national goods will naturally become popular!</p>
<p>Carrying national goods home, men, women, old and young, whether they eat, use, wear, or dress, are all national goods. It is really a house full of national goods, and the joy is harmonious</p>
<p>In fact, everyone can think of the above points at ordinary times; but at this time when everyone is busy shopping for New Year gifts and New Year goods, I especially remind everyone to review them firmly!</p>
<h3>Reflection and Final Efforts</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, this year, which is called the "National Goods Year for Citizens," has only one month left. For the past so much time, we seem to need to review how the national goods movement has been going? To what extent have the people of the country made efforts for national goods? This cannot be said to be a meaningless move, right? The answers we have obtained in newspapers and national goods publications are indeed more advanced than in the past, because the news of national goods that come into our eyes, such as national goods inspections, national goods visits, holding national goods exhibitions, creating national goods markets, etc., are continuously published, and from all provinces, cities, and counties across the country, and even extended to overseas Nanyang, Singapore, and other places, there are national goods news broadcasts, so on the surface, this cannot be said to be a special good phenomenon, but on the other hand, it is suspicious? Seeing the monthly report of the International Trade Bureau, the figures for the import surplus of various foreign goods are always very amazing! Sometimes, the number of the previous session is even increased. What's more, luxury goods, cosmetics, toys, and other things that are not practical often account for a huge amount of this, from which it can be seen that the national people have not yet fully purchased national goods, which is the most obvious fact. As for the past few ×× National Goods Years, they have disappeared in the midst of obscurity and lack of much contribution, which is very regrettable! And this National Goods Year for Citizens has only a short few dozen days left. We should finally step up our efforts and make some achievements to establish a good foundation for the national goods industry and serve as a guide for carrying out the national goods movement in the coming year. We should always be conscientious and consistent from beginning to end and must achieve the national people's aspiration to use national goods.</p>
<h3>An Easy Way to Encourage the Use of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>When it comes to the issue of promoting national goods, on the one hand, it is of course hoped that the general national goods factories will make appropriate improvements in the quality of goods so as to achieve sturdiness, durability, and beauty. At the same time, it is necessary to persuade the compatriots who usually love to use foreign goods to reverse their past habits, change their ideas, and stand on the same front to work together for national goods. Only by advancing in both ways can we achieve the great effect of promoting national goods, which is a truth that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Regarding the first problem, I believe that the general national goods factories are already starting to work on it, which is naturally a gratifying phenomenon, so there is no need to talk much about it here. As for persuading the general public who usually love to use foreign goods to reverse their past habits, divorce foreign goods, and fall in love with national goods, this is a problem worth discussing.</p>
<p>The reporter recently visited Mr. Chen Diexian, an old senior in the national goods industry, Tianxu Wosheng, and talked with him about the issue of encouraging the use of national goods. Mr. Chen proposed a very good method, which I think is of great value for public introduction and public publication.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said: "I receive an average of more than ten letters from people every day. Some want me to guide them in making a living, some want me to guide them in studying small industries, and some want me to guide them in academic studies. I always try my best to tell each comrade who writes to me what I know, hoping that he can find a way. However, many letters often use foreign envelopes and foreign stationery, which I think is very necessary to persuade them. Therefore, I specially engraved a seal with the six characters 'I Advise You Not to Use Foreign Goods' on it. When I encounter this kind of letter, in addition to answering the letter, I also put a seal on the end of the letter to express my meaning of persuasion. Since this method was implemented, I have rarely received this kind of letter! Perhaps this is the result of my persuasion..." After listening to the old man's words, I felt that there was a great truth in it. At the same time, I thought: We can also learn from this easy way to encourage the use of national goods. I hope that all readers will pay attention to it. If we receive this kind of letter in the future, why don't we also imitate Mr. Chen's method?</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this small seal of "I Advise You Not to Use Foreign Goods." You must know that this has a very important relationship with the psychological construction of the general public to promote national goods!</p>
<h3>Re-discussing College Students and Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>In previous issues of this magazine, there seemed to have been an article about college students using domestic goods. The author poignantly pointed out that current college students are only indulging in material civilization and are actually promoting foreign goods. However, this may only occasionally happen in universities near big cities. Most universities, such as Peking University, Zhejiang University, Central University, and Jinling University, still live frugal lives. The author himself, as well as many friends studying at universities near and far, almost all feel that university life is not as extravagant as they imagined during middle school. Especially in the inland areas, we often find four or five comrades renting a small back room together, making their own tea, mending their own clothes, and even taking on odd jobs to support themselves when they are free. This cannot be considered an encouraging reality.</p>
<p>However, college students are almost people who have a significant impact in the education field. Promoting domestic goods has a great relationship, both indirectly and directly. Now, let's discuss it from two aspects.</p>
<p>(1) Indirect aspect: College students should have the desire to contribute to the domestic goods industry. When a person is studying, the foundation for their lifelong work is almost laid. What is our lifelong work? Naturally, this is based on personal interests and should not be forced. However, as far as possible, special attention should be paid to subjects related to domestic goods. For example, those studying commerce should pay special attention to the annual statistics of foreign goods exports and the financial management of new industries. Those studying engineering should study enthusiastically the improvement of domestic goods factory equipment and the facilities of foreign factories. This may be of great help for future work.</p>
<p>(2) Direct aspect: First, practicing the use of domestic goods must start with oneself. It is unforgivable to buy a foreign product when one knows that a domestic product is available. Many people in society are dissatisfied with college students' empty slogans. In fact, sometimes these contradictory things do happen, which is very shameful. Second, we must awaken the general public with lagging culture to use domestic goods. The youth in the north have done a lot of practical work in the past six months, and promoting domestic goods is one of them. It is said that the results are very good. This magazine often publishes articles on how to promote domestic goods, and many of them are very practical. If you want to do it, then do it immediately and don't wait for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Why are college students suspected of being promoters of foreign goods? Why are they ridiculed that one more college student means one more leak for the country? Of course, there are many rich young masters in universities who wear the most fashionable clothes every day as if they are competing with each other. Of course, there are also those who are intoxicated with material enjoyment and encounter romantic lives. However, do not ignore the vast majority of progressive college students, they love to use the products of national industries, they are absolutely unwilling to follow the crowd!</p>
<p>We want to go further, unite the majority of comrades, and move forward with big strides towards the most beneficial path for domestic goods!</p>
<h3>"Foreign Goods" and "Smuggled Goods"</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Manor Owner</p>
<p>—Both are the only great enemies destroying our country's economy—</p>
<p>Speaking of "foreign goods," everyone knows that they are something that can ruin the country! As for why "foreign goods" can lead a country to ruin? It is said that everyone already knows it. Because buying "foreign goods" is no different from "holding a great weapon upside down." In plain language, it means sending money to foreigners to manufacture guns and weapons to invade our country! Not only that, but the more "foreign goods" are bought, the more money is exported. The national economy and people's livelihood will become poorer day by day. There will be a day when it will perish on its own without being invaded! This is just like a person's blood. If it is allowed to flow continuously, it will eventually run out, and one day, "Alas, alas!"</p>
<p>As for "smuggled goods"? This is the most serious and unfortunate thing that has happened in this "Citizens' Domestic Goods Year"! It can also be said that this year's "Citizens' Domestic Goods Year" has revealed something even more terrifying than "foreign goods"! Because, on the one hand, it can reduce a country's tax revenue, or even completely cut it off! On the other hand, it can destroy a country's "domestic goods," or even completely eliminate them! Therefore, it can make a country's economy collapse faster! It is even more unimaginable!</p>
<p>Alas! From this point of view, both "foreign goods" and "smuggled goods" are enough to ruin our country and are the only great enemies destroying our country's economy! We must not ignore them. We must not buy "foreign goods," and we must not buy "smuggled goods!" We should quickly uphold the purpose of "saving the country with domestic goods" to protect "domestic goods!" We should quickly uphold the purpose of "saving the country with domestic goods" to overthrow "foreign goods" and "smuggled goods!"</p>
<h3>The Raw Material Problem of Vegetable Oil</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Since ancient times, our country has used vegetable oils, such as soybean oil and rapeseed oil, for lighting lamps. Later, since the import of cheap petroleum from foreign countries and its dumping, the people only sought immediate enjoyment and disregarded future suffering, causing the native oil plants of our country to be gradually reduced in planting, and the import of petroleum also increased year by year. Just calculating the more than five million households in Zhejiang, each household uses an average of one box of petroleum per year, and the money overflowing from the province is more than 20 million yuan. Therefore, this is also one of the reasons for the collapse of the rural economy. Now, fortunately, someone has invented a vegetable oil lamp using electrical pressure, and the "China Vegetable Oil Factory" has also emerged. The factory is jointly organized by the construction departments of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces. It is currently preparing everything and will be formally established before vegetable oil products are launched on the market this year. But I believe that after this vegetable oil lamp is promoted in the future, the production of vegetable oil will not be able to meet the demand, and the price of oil will inevitably rise, making it still difficult to compete with petroleum. Therefore, the first step for the vegetable oil factory now should be to advise farmers to plant more oil plants, such as Chinese tallow trees, camellias, rapeseed, peanuts, etc. Among them, the easiest to sow and the most effective is rapeseed. (Also known as kale mustard, commonly known as rapeseed, its seeds are used to extract rapeseed oil). Because rapeseed is planted in winter, it does not interfere with rice cultivation, and the harvest is very abundant. According to usual, each mu of field can harvest 100 jin of seeds. This 100 jin of rapeseed can extract 30 jin of oil. Each farming family can plant one mu of rapeseed, which is enough to supply the needs of the whole year. This matter is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. I deeply hope that those in power can raise their voices, so that all mountains will respond, and it is also one of the gains of tightening the national economy and blocking leaks.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Actual Sales Show Significant Improvement, Yarn Prices Advance Steadily, New Year Holiday Relationship, Empty Positions Endure Pain to Cover, Indian Merchants Return to Drag In, Each Month Rises Strongly by Three Yuan, Today's Yarn and Cloth Settlement Market Closed</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the market trend is firm, because the current yarn buyers' purchases have risen again, and the three-product yarn market is strong and expensive, which has caused people's hearts to move. Also, at the turn of the year, the market has a five-day holiday. Generally, short sellers, seeing the unfavorable wind, have to endure pain to cover their positions. Gold industry merchants also come to drag in, so the market price advances steadily. The January period has risen outside the 50-yuan mark. However, the stock of 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count coarse yarn in the yarn and cloth warehouse totals 7,795 bales.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Reaches the 50-Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The opening of the forward market of cotton yarn saw slight declines in all months, but before long, because the current yarn sales market was more active, Osaka's three-product futures market was closed, and the current yarn telegrams showed that except for a one-yuan drop in 16-count yarn, the rest were unchanged. The market lacked sellers, because from tomorrow's settlement onwards, the market will have a five-day holiday for the New Year. Generally, short sellers, in order to avoid danger, mostly square their positions, so the market situation is particularly firm. The market then rose slowly, and as a result, each month rose by one yuan to one yuan and eight jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, a buying wind suddenly rose, and it was rumored that Qiao Zhifu came to buy again. Current yarn transactions were active, and short sellers also came to cover their positions, and the momentum tightened suddenly. January penetrated outside the 50-yuan mark, and the settlement period jumped up by one yuan and seven or eight jiao. The second session returned slightly, and by the third closing, it rose again. As a result, each month rose by one yuan and six jiao to two yuan and one jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 3,950, Zhenda 1,100 bales, Taixing 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 1,950 bales, Wang Taixing 1,000 bales, Taichang 1,000 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, Jinkang 1,350 bales, Jinchang 1,350 bales, Shenchang 1,350 bales, and Dachang 700 bales. Jifeng bought 1,400 bales, Hexing 1,350 bales, Minghua 1,450 bales, Renfeng 1,300 bales, Dachangcheng 1,700 bales, Changfeng 4,850 bales, Yicheng 1,950 bales, Runkang 1,350 bales, and Fukang 2,700 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Warehouse Receipts Open at 1,400 Bales</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are still good. It was found that all the trading houses bought a total of 2,648 bales of current and forward yarn on the same day, including 1,400 bales of January-term 20-count and 16-count Caifeiji yarn.</p>
<h3>Speculation Concentrates on Forward Cotton Yarn, the Cotton Market Feels Clearer, at the Same Time, Current Cotton Mills' Appetite is Also Dull</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and the market situation is very soft, because Indian cotton has fallen back, factory demand has turned quiet, people's hearts are scattered, and the speculative target is still concentrated on forward cotton yarn. In fact, the inventory is still abundant, but there are quite a few people who take advantage of the low price to absorb and herd because the difference between the yarn and cotton prices is too far.</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Prices Show No Ups and Downs</p>
<p>The opening of the forward market of cotton saw consistent declines in all months, because most people's psychology was not optimistic and Indian cotton fell back, but American cotton rose, and the spot price penetrated outside the 1.3-jiao mark. Also, the prices in various producing areas are firm, and some people absorb and do not release. In the second session, the yarn market was good and rebounded repeatedly. As a result, each month did not move compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the market situation was mediocre, people's hearts were scattered, and at the same time, the current cotton mills' appetite was dull. As a result, each month was the same as the morning closing price. It was found that Taichang sold 6,700 dan, Dafu 1,500 dan, Yuanda 1,400 dan, Taixing 4,600 dan, Changyu 1,400 dan, Changfeng 4,000 dan, Xiesheng 1,700 dan, Yuanxingchang 6,700 dan, Zhenda 1,900 dan, Hexing 4,100 dan, Yichang 3,600 dan, and Dachang 2,300 dan, Xinchang 2,200 dan. Tongji bought 10,400 dan, Jifeng 2,200 dan, Hengyi 3,200 dan, Dafeng 3,300 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Minghua 3,800 dan, Renfeng 1,600 dan, Yuda 1,800 dan, Runkang 3,200 dan, and Shengyuan 3,500 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Current Cotton Consumption Turns Sluggish</p>
<p>Factory demand is dull. The sources were calculated to be 2,180 bales of Yao cotton and 1,980 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>Prices Rise, American Cotton Brokers Purchase in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton saw increases of 5 to 14 pounds. Domestic and foreign counterparts and brokers saw that various prices were rising, the European political situation was unstable, consumption was increasing, and there were not many hedging sales, so they purchased in large quantities. Later, because bulls closed their positions and grain prices softened, a portion experienced a reaction. However, counterparts continued to absorb, and the trend was still firm. The current cotton spot was very firm, and domestic inquiries were very smooth. The cloth market was quiet and firm. Before closing, the public bought in, and the market price was firm again. The spot price rose by 12 pounds, and the futures price rose by 10 to 15 pounds. English cotton spot rose by 9 points, and futures rose by 11 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to hedging sales, but it recovered midway due to sporadic purchases by exporters. In the end, due to bulls taking profits and hedging sales, the market price softened again. Pingguoer fell by 1.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.25 to 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram of the 28th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast on the 29th was: Bailuoxi at 231 rupees, up 1 rupee; Aomula at 211 rupees, up 0.75 rupees; Pingguoer at 178 rupees, up 1 rupee.</p>
<p>Attached are the weekend statistics of American cotton on the left (unit: thousand bales)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fine Cloth and Fine Twill Achieve Greatly Active Transactions, Japanese Factories Open Futures for 2,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the piece goods market was driven by the development of actual sales of current yarn and cotton for several consecutive nights, and the rising wind of forward yarn reignited, causing the piece goods industry to be stirred up, and the buying mood rose sharply. Spot and futures of white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill achieved greatly active transactions, and the market quickly moved upward. In the morning market, after large amounts of spot goods from counterparts were sold off yesterday, more than 500 packages of fine cloth and fine twill, there were still balances to be released, so the market was calm. Afterwards, with the gradual rise of forward yarn, the mood gradually turned good. Japanese merchants opened spot futures of fine cloth for February and March for 3-400 pieces, and the price had already been raised by 2 jiao (per piece) compared to the previous day. Later, with a surge in buyers, the number of pieces was lacking, and the price was gradually raised by another 1 jiao or so, and the total transaction amount was about 2,000 pieces. The rising momentum of spot goods was weaker, and it also rose by about 1 jiao. Fine cloth and fine twill from the local factory also rebounded by 5 fen to 1 jiao (per piece). The market of coarse cloth and fine twill was still calm, and spot sales also turned active, with the most concentrated interest from local dyeing factories, wholesale merchants, and large stores, as well as merchants from the mainland. Merchants from the Yangtze River region also claimed that it was not bad, while merchants from the north and south were generally lacking in buying interest. The trend of colored cloth and colored twill was gradually good, while goods such as Zhigong Biji, line cloth, and woolen cloth all reported shrinkage, and the market was also tired and sluggish.</p>
<h3>Finance: Covering Short Positions and Cutting Long Positions Occur Simultaneously, Gold Price Fluctuations are Still Limited</h3>
<p>The gold market was even more peaceful yesterday, and counterparts' psychology reverted to a wait-and-see attitude. There was still a large amount of short covering in the market at low prices, and buyers were also slightly active, and the middle was slightly firm, but the results were still difficult to improve. In the early morning, overseas silver markets, both in England and the United States, rose, and the forward silver price in Monte Video rose by 4 li, exchange rates all rose, the London spot gold did not move, the central bank's listing revealed that England and the United States were both flat, the customs gold unit did not move, the listing price for standard gold was still 1151 yuan, and there was a lack of transactions outside the market. The opening in the morning was slightly low, and although the market fell in many sessions after opening, it was still easy to recover, and the rises and falls were limited. HSBC's listing revealed that England and the United States were both flat, and at this time it was still tired due to spot brokers and long positions selling off, but there was a large amount of short covering at low prices. The silver balancing tax revealed an increase of 1 fen, and the market gradually stabilized. The same was true at noon. Although the market in the afternoon was flat, it was slightly firm once after buyers came to be active. However, large players intentionally closed their positions on the long side, and gradually became unsustainable, and finally it was flat and tired. The swap was posted by long positions at 1.4 yuan yesterday. After the one-day market situation is recorded,</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 1154.8 yuan, a drop of 1 jiao compared to the previous close. Shengyuan Yongqian Changxiang sold off, retreating to 4 jiao and 6 fen.

Qiafeng Yongcheng Dading Kangyi Da and others purchased in succession, and the silver balancing tax rose another 1 fen, gradually rising, and Qiafeng Yongxu had short covering, and the closing rose to 1155 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of the afternoon market was 1155 yuan, and Juda Qingfa Yongjin posted, rising to 5 jiao and 4 fen. Yuanmao Yongdade Cheng took advantage of the high price to supply the market, and then it fell to 4 jiao and 7 fen as Dade Cheng came to sell off again. The closing was 1154.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the central bank's standard gold price, and the listing was still 1151 yuan, which was less than 4 yuan above the closing price. The January bookkeeping price was 1153 yuan, and the February price was 1155 yuan. The morning supplementary water price was 1152 yuan. The price of pure gold was increased by 10 yuan, to 1164.8 yuan. The spot market situation continued to be tired, and the price of refined gold was increased by 16 yuan.

The swap was posted by Shengyuan Yong to Chengda with 133 bars, at only 1.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were limited. In summary, Yida Qiafeng Yongcheng Dading Kangshenda Yongqingfa Yong and others were on the buying side, while Dade Cheng Hengyu Qian Changxiang Dafeng Heng Shengyuan Yongfuxing Yong Tongtaichang and others were on the selling side.</p>
<p>It was found that the one-day market situation was sluggish. The opening in the morning was 1154.8 yuan, the lowest was 1154.5 yuan, the highest was 1155.4 yuan, and the closing was 1154.8 yuan, with only 9 jiao of ups and downs. As a result, it still fell by 1 jiao. There were 2,394 bars remaining in the January period, with a total of five long positions and ten short positions. The chips for the February period totaled 6,629 bars, with a total of 34 long positions and 16 short positions.

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Merchants Settle Accounts Extremely Actively, English and American Exchange Rates Remain Flat Domestically</h3>

After opening, Chinese merchants sold recent contracts slightly, and banks maintained them cheaply. HSBC's listing revealed that England and the United States were both flat and still traded. Mobil Oil Company strongly closed near and distant American dollars, and banks traded against each other. The silver balancing tax rose by 1 fen, and although it was tight, it still hesitated, because the psychology of Chinese merchants was not yet good. At noon, it still fluctuated due to the uneven plugging by banks. Although foreign banks had selling interest in the afternoon market, it was still fixed because British and American tobacco companies strongly closed shillings and Hong Kong telegraphed to buy American dollars. The recent selling price at the close was an English exchange rate of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 53125, and an American exchange rate of 29 yuan and 78125, which was flat for England and loose by 03125 for the United States compared to the previous close.

<h3>Securities: Public Debt Delivery of More Than 18 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was the day for handling the December futures delivery. The total delivery amount was 18,765,000 yuan. Among them, except for the 12,965,000 yuan that was self-accounted by the brokers, only 5,800,000 yuan was delivered at the exchange. Compared with the previous month, there was a gradual increase. The consignees were mostly from the financial sector, and the consignors were mostly retail investors. Since the market started on October 28, the market situation has been extremely stable because it was the time when long and short positions were competing. The market price had been hovering for a long time. However, due to the rumor of the organization of a long position company, major players bravely bought in, and the trend gradually rose from brewing to slowly rising until November 28. Due to the firm popularity, long positions rose again wildly, and the market price unanimously moved towards a new high. However, due to the excessive price, actual goods gradually flowed out. On December 10, a certain financial giant sold off with an unlimited amount, causing the market to gradually become sluggish. On the 14th, due to drastic changes in the environment and changes in Xi'an, the popularity suddenly became terrifying, and the market price plummeted by 4 yuan to the limit, and retail investors were eager to close their positions, and the market price fell by another 1-2 yuan in the session. Fortunately, the government maintained its position, and the banking industry started to recruit and support, and the storm calmed down, and the market price rebounded quickly. On the 25th, because Chairman Chiang safely escaped, the market rose rapidly. The total transaction amount was 24,260,500 yuan. The total amount of delivery accounting and transaction is listed on the left (unit: hundreds of yuan).</p>
<h3>Grain: Bulls in Futures Wheat Slightly Sold Off, Market Price Fell Back with Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for futures wheat was generally calm in the morning session. Because the price of foreign wheat was good by 6-7 jiao the previous day, but yesterday Chicago fell by 1.4 yuan in the near term and 3-4 jiao in the long term, and Canada fell by 2 jiao, the market price stabilized after the opening, and there were few transactions. Because the flour market has stopped and accounts will be closed at the end of the year, there was little competition. Until the afternoon session, it was still stable at first. Then, non-industry bulls sold off in all months, and the market sentiment turned soft, falling back by 1-2-3 fen. The current wheat market has seen very clear deliveries in recent days. Extra-high-quality goods have been priced at more than 6.7 yuan and half a jiao, and second-quality goods at 6 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen, with only a few hundred packages traded.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain Exchange will hold auctions for all months until yesterday, and will normally hold auctions on January 5 next year.</p>
<h3>Flour Delivery Only 2,000 Packages</h3>
<p>Flour Delivery Also Rescheduled to Open on the 5th of Next Year</p>
<p>The flour delivery for December was still lonely. Only 2,000 packages of Yuanshan Deer from the Wuxi Jiufeng Factory were delivered, and were received by this street. Otherwise, there was nothing. The market for the exchange was originally scheduled to open on January 4 of next year, and the market had been announced earlier. It is now heard that the miscellaneous grains are scheduled to be auctioned on the 5th, so it must also be delayed by one day, and it is also scheduled to be auctioned as usual on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Early Sen Rice Traded 13,000 Packages, Thin Rice and White Japonica Continued to Rise by 1-2 Jiao</h3>
<p>(Early Sen Rice) Yesterday's market turned active. Arrivals were still shipped from various ports along the Yangtze River. Production areas were seeking sales by transferring shipments to Shanghai because sales in Guangdong were stagnant. However, merchants in Guangdong preferred to directly arrange shipments from Hunan Province, complaining about cumbersome procedures and various inspections and difficulties. Yesterday, they also purchased 2,000 packages of Han rough rice in the Shanghai market, and the North Ocean Organic Red Mill was sold out. Shantou and Zhengzhou continued to arrange purchases, and the countryside and villages in this street also had smooth purchases, and the market turned active. The total daily sales were more than 6,000 packages of Gan rice, 561 packages of Xiang rice, 2,000 packages of Han silk, and 4,200 packages of Ningbo Jiaxing rice, totaling 12,300 packages. With the active trading, the price also jumped up by 5-6 fen to beyond a Jiao.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for each trading house were slightly scarce, with a total of more than 60 houses arriving, with a total of 12,4-500 dan of goods, of which there were more than 40 houses of thin rice. Although the sales market in this street was not weak, the appetite was mediocre. Trading houses such as Pingjin Qingyan only traded 4-5,000 packages of thin rice, so the thin rice market became stable and did not fluctuate. Thick Japonica rose by one jiao due to the scarcity of goods, and Du Yangjian was also tight, and Yinyuan was also close to a jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were only a few ships arriving from various places downstream, only 26-7 houses. The sales of white japonica, the hoarding households and retail sales in the early market continued to move, but the market slackened in the afternoon, and the market price rose by another 1-2 jiao. The shop sales of thin rice were quite active, and the price was more than two jiao higher. Early rice followed the price increase of about a Jiao, and the warehouse absorption of Baiyuan was activated, and the price was increased by 2-3-4 fen. Yangdu and other sen rice were priced up by one jiao, and the Yinyuan price was also tightened by more than a Jiao. Changbang special white japonica was not open yesterday.</p>
<h3>Special Feature: Production, Sales, and Manufacturing of Qihong Tea (Continued Part 2)</h3>
<p>Qihong black tea is mainly sold abroad. Therefore, all boxed tea is transported to Shanghai and sold to foreign firms. Very little is sold in retail stores. The Qihong black tea price mentioned in this section refers specifically to the market price in Shanghai. According to the Shanghai Commodity Price Quarterly and Monthly published by the National Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance, the market price of Qihong is based on the wholesale price in Shanghai on the 15th of each month. The following is a record of the daily wholesale prices of top-grade Qimen black tea in the past twelve years: (Unit: Yuan, index uses the market price of 1926 as 100)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Increased Soybean Sales</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market was closed the day before yesterday in celebration of Chairman Chiang, so trading in the market was lively yesterday. Soybean sales were driven by oil pressing factories and inland oil mills, and the number of transactions increased sharply. It is estimated that 123 carloads of Sipingjie soybeans, 4 carloads of Bengbu soybeans, 3 carloads of Zhengcheng soybeans, 500 packages of Pizhou soybeans, 1 carload of Zhuang soybeans, more than 1,000 packages of other Za soybeans, 400 packages of Chi soybeans, and more than 100 packages of Dingjiazhou soybeans were traded. Prices rose by six or seven points to one dime compared to last Saturday. In short, the Dalian soybean market had more gains than losses, and the exchange's standard prices were therefore strong. Most traders aimed to profit from arbitrage, so the amount of spot goods outside was reduced, and it was not easy to find small quantities in the market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: 10,000+ Bags of Dutch White Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was stable and attractive yesterday. The guild's price was 21.60 yuan for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar and 6.22 yuan for transshipment goods. No. 9 Dutch red KD mark rose another 5 points to 16.10 yuan. Dongbai No. 489 and the local factory's cotton white sugar remained unchanged. The price board showed Guangbang offering more than 300 packages of Zhu Qing at 12 yuan, and Jianbang offering more than 200 packages of Diao Qing at 12.80 yuan. Chao Bang offered dozens of packages of Huanggang Qing. It was heard from Shantou yesterday that due to Chiang's return to Nanjing, people's hearts were at peace, and various business groups resumed operations, pushing production prices up another 2 dimes. Yesterday, 10,360 bags of Dutch coarse white sugar were imported by the Zhini Canada ship.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sichuan Fungus Continues to Rise; Southern Gorgon Nut Sales are Better, Hence Rebound</h3>
<p>The price of Sichuan fungus on the price board was 115 yuan, and dozens of consecutive trades had been made, but the market became tight again yesterday, rising another 5 yuan to 120 yuan before continuing to open trades. At the same time, production prices in Hankou also rose by 3-4 yuan, with the higher end at 100 yuan to 98 yuan. It is said that the top-quality small-packaged "Air Mail" brand sells for 115 yuan, with subsequent reductions, and the trend feels quite strong.</p>
<p>Southern Gorgon nut: Recently, in addition to occasional purchases from the Hua Bang, there is also demand from the local inland market, so the selling price has increased again compared to before. High-quality goods sell for 52 yuan, while the market for pond gorgon nut remains flat, with screened Zhuang selling for 18-19 yuan, and ordinary ones for 16-17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Many American Silk Dealers' Telegrams Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Yokohama silk market rebounded slightly yesterday, with standard silk futures falling by 7 to 10 yuan. New York, however, followed in Yokohama's footsteps the day before, and both exchange and easy-to-hold prices rose sharply. Japanese silk at 83 cents rose by 9 cents, and 75 uniformity rose by 1 dime. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by 9 cents. Exchange standard silk for December rose by 5 cents, and for May rose by 4.5 cents. In Lyon, only Japanese silk rose by half a franc, while other silk products sold at the original price. Many telegrams from American silk dealers arrived yesterday, but due to the overly strong sentiment in Shanghai, the volume of transactions was not large. 78 uniformity white silk from factories had a tendency to rise above 780 yuan on the selling board. Domestic sales of "B" grade were generally offered at 760 yuan. Sichuan white silk from factories also had considerable sales yesterday, and the price was firm, no less than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang white silk from factories. Yesterday, a total of 188 packages were traded.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Double-Coated American Tinplate Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The tinplate market has recently seen a turnaround, likely because overseas telegrams are reporting rising prices, and local inventories are scarce. Due to fears of a large price increase next spring, efforts are being made to purchase stock, causing prices to rise continuously, especially for double-coated American tinplate, which has risen by as much as 6-7 yuan. Currently, double-coated (90 lbs) American tinplate is quoted at 44 yuan, Italian goods at 41 yuan, and German goods at 40 yuan. As for double-coated (100 lbs) American goods, they are quoted at 50 yuan, Italian goods at 44 yuan, and German goods at 42 yuan. In addition, there is no market for British and French goods due to a shortage of supply. It is said that yesterday's trading saw the sale of 600+ boxes, purchased by hoarders and manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Tai Xuan)</p>
<p>The year is coming to an end. The Republic of China calendar on the desk, for the 25th year, has been flipped to the last one or two pages, with a thickness of several inches. "Another year has easily passed, and the spring breeze has returned." The wonderful years have passed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>We don't need to be saddened by the spring flowers and autumn moons, and we don't need to lament the increase in age. Let us examine the work and life we have done in this year, whether we have increased the efficiency of our work, or whether we have increased the progress of our studies and knowledge. For the country in distress, have we had a proper understanding and made our best efforts to save it? If we have a reasonably satisfactory answer, then this year has not been wasted. At the same time, we must also examine our personal lives, whether we have increased bad habits and bad customs, and use "if you have them, correct them; if you don't have them, be on guard" to warn ourselves.</p>
<p>The twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China is about to pass, and the twenty-sixth year is coming up next. The desk calendars are being prepared to be replaced with new ones. At the beginning of the first page of the Republic of China's twenty-sixth year, we hope that our personal lives, group lives, and national lives will have a new atmosphere like the new year. However, thinking of the international environment and the country that is being invaded, it naturally requires our entire nation to make greater efforts!</p>
<h3>Gentlemen in Dance Halls and Soldiers on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>What they wear:</p>
<p>Gentlemen – New Western suits, spring leather shoes; all ordered from abroad.</p>
<p>Soldiers – Silk wadded vests, national cloth military uniforms; all donated by the rear.</p>
<p>What they eat:</p>
<p>Gentlemen – Champagne, famous cigarettes, spearmint, coffee.</p>
<p>Soldiers – Yellow sand, fine mud, northwest wind, snowflakes.</p>
<p>What they hear:</p>
<p>Gentlemen – Royal band, playing famous melodies for dancing.</p>
<p>Soldiers – Gunfire and cannon fire, mixed with the tragic cries of wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>What they see:</p>
<p>Gentlemen – Couples embracing and the charming smiles of graceful dancers.</p>
<p>Soldiers – Waves of soldiers charging and the brutal massacre by the enemy.</p>
<p>What they smell:</p>
<p>Gentlemen – The fragrance of sugar, wine, and the perfume of the dancers.</p>
<p>Soldiers – The smell of gunpowder, explosives, and the bloody odor of the wounded.</p>
<p>What they shout:</p>
<p>Gentlemen – Good sister, come on! Give me a sweet kiss!</p>
<p>Soldiers – Brothers, kill them! What are a few wounds to be afraid of!</p>
<p>Ah, the gentlemen in the dance halls are still so happy! In the bright lights and on the smooth dance floor, they tightly embrace and dance, never thinking of those soldiers charging desperately in the rain of bullets and on the thick, frozen ice!</p>
<p>Dear readers! After reading the above comparison, we close our eyes and think carefully about which is the true glory.</p>
<h3>Chunzi</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Miss Chunzi is a waitress at a certain coffee shop I recently met in the past two months. She is Chinese. Her original name was not Chunzi. Because she joined the coffee shop three months ago, the boss gave her that alias.</p>
<p>The reason I noticed Miss Chunzi was because her unmuted local accent suggested that she and I might be from the same hometown. After inquiring, I learned that her hometown was only thirty miles away from mine, and that she came from a family of scholars and poets.</p>
<p>She is twenty-five years old this year, but she always says she is twenty-two to strangers. Because of her small body, saying she is twenty-two is enough. It is said that she left home at the age of seventeen. At that time, she was studying in Shanghai on her own. Due to the temptation of love, she did not hesitate to fall out with her conservative family and was driven out by her strict father. Because her mother was a stepmother, her brother was a wastrel, and her two older sisters had been married for many years, her feelings for them were very weak, so she left home without any nostalgia.</p>
<p>Then, she married her lover. Only after marriage did she realize that he was so cruel that it was impossible to live with him, and it was extremely difficult to find a trace of pleasant air in the family. After sixteen months, she gave birth to a child, who died less than a month later. As a result, the couple's life became even more miserable, and they argued every day. Finally, in the nineteenth month after their marriage, they unconditionally dissolved the bonds of mutual pain in a lawyer's office.</p>
<p>At that time, her heart was filled with pain, loneliness, and pessimism occupied her entire life. She wanted to continue her studies to acquire considerable living skills, but she felt that she lacked both the spirit and the economy. So she joined a song and dance troupe, mingled in the film circle, and even worked in several dance halls. In between, she left Shanghai twice and went to Hankou, Qingdao, and other places to make a living. In Hankou, she even worked in a factory for a time. During the January 28th Incident, she also worked as a volunteer nurse and then made nursing her profession. However, time flew by quickly, and after five or six years, she still hadn't found a foothold. So, three months ago, she was forced by hunger and cold to temporarily seek a living in the coffee shop, waiting for a chance to develop.</p>
<p>Once, I asked her if she would eventually return to marriage as her final destination. She shook her head with a bitter smile. She said, "In these five or six years of drifting around, I don't know how many men I have seen, and I don't know how many men have pursued me. But one's life is just a mess, and marriage, although it can solve the problem of bread, the mental pain is very severe. I understand this clearly."</p>
<p>Last Sunday, when I went to that coffee shop, she told me that her stepmother had died and her father was calling her home. But she hadn't decided yet. Yesterday, when I went to that coffee shop again with a friend, her companion said that she had received another letter from her father, resigned, and returned to her hometown the night before last. So I prayed for her, blessing this homeless little crow, to return to the embrace of her family and restore her original happiness, and to heal the deep wounds she had suffered in the past seven or eight years. May the light shine on the path she is about to take.</p>
<h3>Winter Sweet</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>In the past, Fan Shihou wrote a treatise on plum blossoms, counting nearly a hundred species, but many flowers had three names, and in reality, there were only half that number. Some flowers bloom early, even before the Beginning of Winter, but this is because of the warm climate in Luofu and Yu Ling. Therefore, the ancients had the saying, "The plum blossoms on the ridge bloom first in October." In places like Wuxia, West Lake, Kuaiji, and Siming, although there are many century-old trees with branches twisted in myriad ways, providing a cool shade all around, under which dozens of people can sit, scholars and hermits often bring wine to appreciate them, but it is not easy for them to bloom until the end of winter and the coming of spring.</p>
<p>As for wintersweet, although it has the name "plum," it is not actually a plum blossom because it blooms at the same time as plum blossoms and its fragrance is similar. Its color is like beeswax, so it is called "wintersweet." Some say that it always blooms in the twelfth lunar month, so it is also called "twelfth plum," but the explanation varies. According to the classification of the tree, it is a deciduous shrub with long oval leaves that grow in pairs, unlike true plum blossoms, and it is also a unique flower with horizontal and slender branches. There are three types of flowers: bell-shaped, lotus-shaped, and dog-English, with the bell-shaped being the most valuable. The petals are round, the color is yellow, and the shape is similar to white plum blossoms. Even when in full bloom, it often looks like it is only half open. If you cut off a branch and place it in a vase, the fragrance can fill the room and last for a month, so people often pair it with nandina and place it in a vase to celebrate the season, considering it an indispensable elegant item in winter.</p>
<p>Behind my house, there is a vacant pond, and all other plants and trees have been abandoned and almost completely desolate, but only this wintersweet remains. It was planted by my late father, and it has been almost a hundred years since then. Therefore, the old branches are intertwined horizontally and vertically, not just two or three, and the withered branches are as large as a strong man's arm, and cannot be grasped. In recent years, without pruning, it feels even more picturesque. In addition, in winter, it is as if spring is coming, and the branches are full of golden-yellow flowers, and the fragrance spreads everywhere. Compared to last year, the flowers are blooming earlier, which is truly a rare phenomenon. As the saying goes, "After the winter solstice, the third 'xu' day is 'la'," but it is not that time yet, so I record it, which is also enough to see the gradual changes in the microclimate.</p>
<h3>Recording Orangutan Blood</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>Orangutan blood is the highest grade of red pigment; because it is taken from live orangutans, its color is particularly vivid, and its price is naturally not cheap. The story of how people obtain orangutan blood is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Hunters set out with flasks of fine wine and all the necessary supplies, and wait on the roadside that orangutans usually pass by. When the orangutans are about to approach, they quickly open the flasks, pour the wine into several large bowls, and arrange them on the road. They vigorously fan the large fans, so that the aroma of the wine spreads everywhere. The hunters then retreat to a hidden place by the roadside and watch secretly. Orangutans always travel in groups, and although they have no clothes on their bodies, they like to wear wooden clogs, making a *ga-da, ga-da* sound when they walk, thinking that they are as majestic as humans! This is exactly the way to give people an opportunity.</p>
<p>Orangutans' love of wine seems to be innate, with no difference between young and old. If there is wine today, they will definitely not return home until they are drunk! They suddenly smell the aroma of wine, which hits their mark, and they all drag their feet forward. Sure enough, they see the bowls of green liquid on the road, and everyone can't help but cheer and shout. However, there are always some older ones who are suspicious of such an unearned reward. Perhaps the danger is not far away, and they have not forgotten the past events. They are about to raise their glasses, but suddenly withdraw their hands, as if a tragic illusion is reflected in front of their eyes. They then drive away the group of young orangutans, while they make chirping sounds, seemingly warning each other not to commit the same mistake. After lingering slightly in this way, the group eventually leaves together.</p>
<p>Not far away, many of them frequently turn their heads, then stop and hesitate, and finally the whole group returns quickly. After going back and forth three or four times, they really can't restrain the temptation of the fragrant aroma, and begin to take small sips to satisfy their cravings. Certainly, once they have started, how can they be willing to stop? So the wine in the bowls is emptied in a rush, until there is no drop left in the bowls, and they have all drunk so much that they have no strength left, and they fall drunk on the roadside in a chaotic mess!</p>
<p>The hunters then jump out at this time, each raising a white blade high, pretending to be menacing, as if they are about to end their lives. They have no way to escape, and can only make pleading sounds. One hunter first stabs an orangutan with a knife, takes a vessel to receive its blood, and points it to the other orangutans to see. They can then understand, and each points to the place on their body where blood can be taken and stabbed with a knife. They will also act out gestures to show the amount of blood they can each supply, so as not to lose their lives, and let you take it as you wish.</p>
<p>Isn't it? "Give me fine wine, and I will repay you with bloody blood." Is it cheap to eat? Can cravings not be restrained completely? We can only look at the source of this orangutan blood!</p>
<h3>Swapped Nests of Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Vows of the Heart with a Cup of Water, Talks of Withered Love Under the Green Lamp; Agreement with Gold Rings, Reporting Longing with Red Beans</p>
<p>The mystery had not been solved, and the next morning, Youmei came again. Today she was wearing the white bamboo cloth uniform from school, and also carried a white cloth schoolbag, simply looking like she was going to school. She was also coming more often, and upon entering the gate, she shouted "Cousin," and went straight to the study. When Guoqi saw this, he was about to reach for his long gown on the coat rack, but Youmei stretched out both arms and stopped him, laughing: "Cousin, if you are like this, you are being too polite. I am someone who comes every day, like a member of the family, why bother with such formalities? Don't you see that I am wearing casual clothes when I come here, and I don't think of coming here as a guest." Guoqi said: "I don't treat Miss Li as a guest either. If I treated Miss Li as a guest, the accommodations in the house would be inadequate." Youmei seemed to feel that there were too many pleasantries, which was close to boring, so she put the schoolbag on the table, with a smile breaking out, and said: "I searched through the trunk, and all I found was this package, big and small. As for which are useful materials and which are waste, I don't know, please choose for yourself." Guoqi was very happy to hear her say that she had brought many historical materials about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and he forgot to avoid suspicion. He immediately rushed forward to pick up the manuscripts and looked at them carefully. In fact, there was no need to look closely, just looking at the color of the paper from afar was enough to be disappointed. It turned out that they were all eight-line letter papers of bright red or peach red, on which were written in regular script nothing more than some old clichés congratulating the New Year. Although the dates were all from the Xianfeng and Tongzhi years, they were just letters of greeting from minor officials of the Qing court to their superiors, and not a single word mentioned the fighting with the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Even if there were some words about pacifying the rebellious atmosphere, they were not historical materials. He looked at twenty or thirty pieces in a row, and they were all like this. Youmei did not say anything while he was looking at these documents. She stood quietly by his side, waving a fan in her hand. Although she was fanning herself to cool off, the wind from the fan was generally blowing towards Guoqi. Guoqi initially did not know this while he was looking at the letters. Later, he stopped momentarily and understood. However, although he was very grateful to her in his heart, he could not say it clearly, so he smiled at her and said: "There are too many things, I can't see clearly for a while." Youmei had forgotten herself and was still fanning the fan herself, also fanning Guoqi, and said: "It doesn't matter. No one in my family has ever touched these documents, so just leave them here with you. Whenever you are done looking at them, return them to me. These things are not my personal property. If they were my personal property, I would give them to my brother." (to be continued)</p>

<h3>Year-End Scenes</h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>—A cross-section of Nanjing Road</p>
<p>The metropolis's artery, stretching toward the racetrack, throbs intensely; the tense crowds flow like blood in the veins. The neon lights on the billboards weave a tapestry of red and green in the air, while the spires of the four major department stores stand quietly in the northwest wind. The flags of the winter sales are densely hung in front of the shops on both sides, and the radio broadcasts New Year's Eve marches, making everyone realize that a long year has quietly crept past behind their anxious lives.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road, the commercial hub of this "Paris of the East," is always so prosperous, so beautiful. Every day, from early morning to late at night, whether it is winter or summer, it never conceals its lively and bustling appearance. The pedestrians, like a swarm of ants, and the vehicles, like a swarm of ants, move from east to west and from west to east. The red and green traffic lights change colors busily, never stopping or becoming quiet for a single moment.</p>
<p>Starting from the Bund, the Sassoon House towers over the rolling Huangpu River. At the intersection of Jiangxi Road, several blood-sucking tubes of the great powers are erected there, with their mouths aimed directly at the city's blood vessels, at every pore of the Chinese people, absorbing large amounts of blood. This economic aggression is no less powerful than artillery.</p>
<p>From the Bowling Green to the New World, that is the most intense scene on Nanjing Road. Here, the large glass windows of the shops display various rare and beautiful goods. There are large silk and satin shops, large fur shops for clothing, large food companies and large tonic shops for food, large furniture companies and large department stores for use; in short, there are all kinds of modern things here. As long as you have enough legal tender in your pocket, then you can get anything you want. If your pocket is "empty," I think it is better to walk away quickly, so as not to get itchy eyes.</p>
<p>In every corner, shadows are wriggling, all of them busy, as if they are doing some secret deals. Some shops, companies, amusement parks, dance halls, and food stores are rushing to decorate for the New Year. In front of several southern goods stores, many dazzling electric lights have been installed, and the customers are indeed attracted to them quite lively. They all come out of the store with bundles of paper packages in their arms, with a satisfied smile on their faces.</p>
<p>In the section near the Rising Sun Building, a row of "goddesses" selling their chastity stand on the sidewalks. For the sake of survival, they cannot enjoy the leisure and comfort of New Year's Eve like ordinary people. As usual, they have to stand in the cold northwest wind on the streets late at night, waiting for someone to come and satisfy their lives, and at the same time, they are willing to let him satisfy his sexual desire once; in this way, both parties are satisfied under the terms of a buying and selling transaction.</p>
<p>In the dead of night, when the loud bells of the Jianghai Customs Station drift into every corner of the city, Nanjing Road, that sinful, prosperous, commercial hub, also lies quietly there like a hibernating giant snake. But it will still be just as active tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3>The Tragic Decline of the Real Estate Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>For someone who lives on a salary, his expenses can be said to be one-third, or even one-half, spent on the issue of "housing." The so-called "land is as valuable as gold" is indeed true in Shanghai!</p>
<p>In recent years, the speculative business of real estate can be said to have entered a state of recession, just like other sectors of the economy. Recently, the Real Estate Industry Association submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government, detailing the tragic decline in land prices and requesting that the Land Bureau reassess land prices and reduce taxes. The petition stated, "In recent years, due to the decline in commerce and the exhaustion of the market in Shanghai, the fall in land prices has been precipitous. Therefore, the real estate industry is the one that suffers the most among commercial sectors. The trend is such that there are often cases of people being bankrupted..." We cannot deny that this tragic situation of falling land prices, which has led to the bankruptcy of real estate businesses, is a true reflection of the facts. In today's increasingly deepening national crisis, this phenomenon is a common one, not surprising!</p>
<p>If those who have land are "suffering" so much, and say that they are the ones who suffer the most, then those who do not have land, especially the ordinary wage earners, their "suffering" is certainly a thousand times greater! Since the January 28th Incident, especially in the past year or two, the general second landlords of Shanghai's lane houses, some of whom used to rely on renting out a building to people and could even make a living, now seem like a golden dream of the past. Second landlords are now full of complaints, and the disputes between tenants (mostly second landlords) and landlords can be said to rise and fall one after another, without end. Although we still cannot see the panic of the second landlords in the more central areas, in areas secondary to the central area, on every lane entrance, square red paper "For Rent" signs, like plasters, are plastered all over the walls. And a closer look at the text of the "For Rent" signs seems to be very "progressive," mostly rich in artistic "allure," as if the "literaryization" of advertising can be smelled in the "For Rent" signs. If the second landlords are still like this, the "third landlords" are certainly "worse than the second"!</p>
<p>The suffering of real estate businesses is indeed a fact, and the miserable situation of tenants is even more undeniable. In today's deepening national crisis, we really cannot point out a path we should take!</p>
<h3>Thoughts Inspired by the "Support Suiyuan Concert"</h3>
<p>— Yin Fei</p>
<p>"All art is propaganda." We hear this sentence often. This sentence is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Some people regard "art" as something unattainable; others regard art as something to cultivate emotions and please the mind. For example, in the film industry, there are so-called "soft school" advocates who believe that movies should only be used as "ice cream for the eyes and a sofa chair for the soul."</p>
<p>But what exactly is "art"? The two words "art" do indeed seem sacred and unattainable. Even if it is unattainable, it cannot but be related to the human world. Once it is related to the human world, objectively, it cannot but have an effect. Moreover, there is also the subjectivity of the "artist" in the middle, and the "artist" is the same as ordinary people, needing to eat and sleep and unable to walk in the air.</p>
<p>After the Suiyuan Incident occurred, regarding the assistance to the soldiers defending the front lines, we are not exaggerating when we say that it can be described as a "national uprising." If we further investigate the occupations and ages of the donors in this "national uprising," we would be even more moved to tears. However, in this regard, how much effort has the art world—let's expand the scope a bit and call it the cultural world—put in? Speaking of which, the cultural world should logically be the guide of the people.</p>
<p>I don't know how it is in other places, but in Shanghai, from what I have seen, people in the art world are lagging behind other people. Not only have they failed to take the lead, but, ridiculously, they are being led by the enthusiasm of the people.</p>
<p>Since the Suiyuan Incident, up to now, let's calculate and see if there have been any exhibitions or other gatherings to promote national self-defense? Sadly, there have been a few, such as the joint broadcasts by several singing groups specializing in broadcasting on the radio, and some piecemeal photography exhibitions with proceeds going to support Suiyuan, and so on. Being able to find ways to raise some money within one's "own position" to help the soldiers defending the territory is naturally commendable. However, is this enough to fulfill one's responsibility, friends engaged in art?</p>
<p>Based on the understanding that "all art is propaganda," in addition to material assistance, we should also have more spiritual assistance. Spiritual assistance is not only directly given to the soldiers defending the front lines, but more importantly, it also lies in how to arouse the passionate patriotic emotions of the people in the rear and how to guide the people to a unified path of resistance. The war of national self-defense can only have a chance of victory if the entire nation is mobilized.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a support Suiyuan concert held by the music community in Shanghai. This is naturally a good thing. Looking at the program list, there were songs such as "The Chinese Nation Will Not Perish," "Song of the Goddess of Liberty," "Who Says We Are Too Young," and "The Flag is Waving" (but also "Three Rose Wishes," etc.). In terms of content, it can be said that the music community has fulfilled its responsibilities. Using skills within one's "own position" to sell tickets to support Suiyuan is the duty of a citizen. And for people in the art world to contribute to the nation and society with their duties is also their duty within their "own position." If one uses decadent music to enchant the audience and takes the opportunity to exchange it for some money to donate to the soldiers defending the front lines, then in terms of the duty of a citizen, it can naturally be considered fulfilled, but in terms of the duty of one's position, he is a sinner! This sin cannot be offset by fulfilling the duty of a citizen. The reason is that...</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>...fulfilling the duty of a citizen is originally one's duty, but using decadent music to numb the people is a sin!</p>
<p>And now, there seem to be quite a few who have forgotten the "duty of one's position" for the sake of the "duty of a citizen"!</p>
<p>The Shanghai music community's support Suiyuan concert naturally takes both into consideration, but for the sake of fulfilling the duty of one's position, I hope that it can be done more deeply and more universally. At times, the duty of one's position is more important than the duty of a citizen.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not only hoping that the music community will do this, but even more so, it is not only hoping that the music community in Shanghai will do this.</p>
<p>If a cultural worker cannot do more than the average citizen in patriotism, then he is ashamed of the two words "culture"!</p>
<h3>Willow</h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>Among plants, I love willows the most. The "Flower Mirror" divides willows into two types. It says about the willow: "The willow is also called the official willow, or the weeping willow. Its nature is soft and brittle. It grows in the north, with many long and soft branches, and green and long leaves. In early spring, it produces catkins, thick as tendons, about an inch long, with yellow flowers. The scales fall off the catkins, very fine and scattered, gradually growing leaves. By late spring, the leaves are fully grown, with small seeds inside, like millet grains, flat, small and black, with white fluff like velvet, commonly known as willow catkins, which fly in the wind. They cause moths in wool clothing and turn into duckweed in ponds. This is the official willow. If the leaves form shade, with long branches several feet or even over ten feet long, swaying downwards, this is the weeping willow. Although it has no fragrance, it sways in the breeze and is often the place where orioles sing and cicadas rest. People take it to please their ears and eyes, and it is a necessary tree in gardens." It says about the poplar: "There are two types of poplar. The white poplar has white hair when its buds are sprouting, and when fully unfolded, its leaves are like pear leaves, long and thick, light green on the surface and white on the back, with long stems that face each other in pairs. When the wind blows, they rustle. People often plant them in cemeteries. They can grow over ten feet tall. There is also the green poplar tree, which is smaller than the white poplar, with leaves that resemble apricot leaves but are slightly longer and larger, and are green in color. Its trunk is also straight. Generally, willow branches are long and brittle, with narrow and long leaves, while poplar branches are short, with round and wide leaves. Willows thrive in water, while poplars thrive in drought. The two trees are not the same, so how can one assume they are the same tree simply because they are mentioned together?"</p>
<p>Here, the two types of willows and poplars are distinguished very clearly. However, the one I love is the "weeping willow" with "leaves forming shade, long branches several feet or even over ten feet long, swaying downwards." But I am, after all, an "ordinary person," and I do not believe the saying that "willow catkins turn into duckweed in ponds," and I call "weeping willows" willows and poplars without distinction.</p>
<p>Liu Tingzhi's "Gongzi Xing" says: "Pitiful willow, heart-breaking tree." When I read this, I had a sense of enlightenment, because the three words "heart-breaking tree" are really a good posthumous name for the willow, a name that can truly capture the soul of the willow. I have not read many books, and I don't know if there are people who regard willows as plants of joy. But I have certainly never seen them.</p>
<p>The "Shishuo Xinyu" says: "When Duke Huan went north to conquer, he passed through Jincheng and saw that the willows planted when he was the Prince of Langya were already ten spans around. He sighed and said, 'Even the trees are like this, how can people bear it?' He grasped the branches and wept." Also, "Gu Yue and Jianwen were the same age, but his hair turned white early. Jianwen said, 'Why did you turn white first?' He replied, 'My figure is like a reed willow, falling at the sight of autumn, while the quality of pine and cypress becomes more luxuriant after frost.'" Therefore, Duke Xuanwu of Huan already had a sense of lateness because the willows were already ten spans around, so he knew that among plants, the willow is also one that "falls early." Compared to pine and cypress, how could he not feel sorrow?</p>
<p>In ancient times, people often broke off willow branches as gifts, so Tang Xianzu's "The Purple Hairpin" in the "Folding Willow at Yangguan" says: "Although Scholar Li is bravely departing today, it is difficult to teach this concubine not to be sad. The Baling Bridge is ahead. This concubine will fold a willow branch before the wine and express my thoughts of Yangguan." Then there is a branch of mistletoe: "Fearing to play the Yangguan tune, the Wei River feels cold, all the peach leaves of Jianggan crossing the waves, the green grass of Tingzhou sticking to the clouds. This willow color of the river bridge welcomes the wind, (folding the willow) Willow! Your slender waist makes a cord to tie people, how laughable that your own catkins are hard to hold." The classic of folding willow at Yangguan naturally comes from Wang Wei's poem: "Weicheng morning rain moistened the light dust, the guesthouse is green, the willow color is new; I urge you to drink one more cup of wine, going west out of Yangguan, there are no old friends." It is said that at that time, the willow trees beside the official road often had their long branches broken off, leaving only bare large branches.</p>
<p>Jiang Yaozhang of the Southern Song Dynasty was famous for his poems, but his prefaces to the poems were actually ten thousand times better than his poems: "Many willows are planted inside Hefei City. When the autumn wind rises in the evening, they rustle." These few words have already depicted the scene of a desolate city in late autumn, yet he only described the willows.</p>
<p>There are really too many works about willows and poplars from ancient times to the present. But what I like the most is Yang Fengbao's "Autumn Willows of West Lake." Because he entrusted a deep and remote feeling, unlike Wang Xincheng's four regulated verses on "Autumn Willows," which tasted like chewing wax. Now I will copy two poems here as the ending of my short essay.</p>
<p>"The misty rain makes the lake and mountains look like the sad eyebrows of a beauty, and the brocade sails send you far away to Yangzhou; I regret that I do not have Chen Fan's spring breeze brush to paint the ink painting of the Southern Dynasty."</p>
<p>"The hall of ten thousand acres is deep and the moon is dark, the singing and dancing in the new pond are unbearable, where are the flying catkins of the Xie family returning to? Only the tender yellow remains to illuminate the night millstone." These two poems really have a feeling of national demise, so the rustling willows, what difference is there from the millet and wheat of Shuli?</p>

The busy attendant, Gao Lishi, is sweeping and cleaning in the Royal Garden with great effort. The autumn scenery in the inner garden is endless, with lotus flowers remaining everywhere in the ponds. After a while, it is reported that Emperor Ming has arrived, supported by his favorite concubine, Yang Guifei. Countless osmanthus flowers are fragrant in the wind, and sometimes parrots call to each other. The imperial banquet is arranged on the flower pavilion, and the tables are filled with delicacies from the sea and mountains. Slender jade hands hold golden pots. The emperor beats the rhythm, the concubine sings, and the dance of the rainbow skirt is unparalleled in the world. Taizhen kneels and presents three cups of wine, and the Emperor joyfully holds and supports her hand. Yang Guifei falls drunk on the couch, a picture of a begonia sleeping in spring. Seeing her drunken and charming appearance, he is even more enchanted. Who would have known that joy was not over before sorrow arrived? It is said that An Lushan launched a rebellion and wielded weapons, directly approaching the capital city. What to do? The Tang Dynasty had enjoyed peace for a long time, and the civil and military officials were unable to resist the enemy. They quickly ordered the Six Armies to protect the emperor. Suddenly, carriages and horses rushed on their long journey, temporarily escaping the smoke of war to fortunate themselves in Shu. Pitifully, the weak and beautiful woman, like a flower, perishes and her fragrance vanishes in a piece of silk, bestowed death at Mawei Slope in a moment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Harmonica Society at 252 Wenmiao Road, Ximen, this city. Since the first session of slightly charging free members, the number of applicants has been extremely enthusiastic. Later applicants have mostly felt disappointed due to the quota being full, and have requested that more classes be opened. This shows that the society is well-managed. Now, in response to the requests of all sectors, the society is specifically seeking new free male and female comrades for the second session, and has established branches at Shanggong Middle School at 186 Whiteker Road (behind the International Hotel) and the South Station Fellow Club. Tuition and fees are waived, and there are advanced classes, beginner autumn classes, harmonica teams, and women's classes. Those interested in studying can quickly register. Registration is limited to the number of places available. Classes start on the 3rd and 4th of this month.</p>

<h3>Behind-the-Scenes at Lianhua Studio</h3>
<p>Li Lili is skilled in rhetoric. Every time she talks and laughs in a gathering, the whole room is filled with spring, as if there is a kind of heat that attracts people to get close to her. Whenever Fei Mu sees Lili, he welcomes her and says: "Spring has arrived in the world."</p>
<p>All colleagues in the factory who have a new haircut must greet everyone they meet. Otherwise, they will be beaten three times. It is not known when or by whom this custom originated. One day, after Yin Xiucen had his haircut, he met a large crowd as usual. Suddenly, he heard a whistle and was slapped on his fat head. At the same time, he heard the curse: "Three slaps for a haircut, no syphilis, no sores."</p>
<p>In "Daughter of the General," Han Langan plays a soldier who, in order to release a serious criminal, is demoted to a groom. He feeds and washes the horses in the stable, singing war songs. He deliberately acts shyly, exposing several bare "oily ribs." The staff at the scene could not help but cover their mouths and laugh.</p>
<p>In "Spring Arrives in the World," Han Langan and Shang Guanwu play butchers who tie up pigs to be slaughtered. But Han is timid as a mouse, assisting from the side, lowering his eyebrows and closing his eyes, not daring to look directly. Shang, on the other hand, holds a knife and stabs directly. As a result, Han is appropriately covered in pig blood, blurring his facial features.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan loves old music songs the most. Her residence next to the Lianhua factory often emits clear and graceful singing, Yanyan, Yangko, etc.</p>
<p>Mei Xishan is good at writing articles and often writes drafts for the Lianhua Factory Newspaper. Her writing is clear and smooth, and her arguments are superb.</p>
<p>In "Spring Arrives in the World," there is a bamboo ware cradle shop and a stone tablet engraving shop next to each other, showing the course of life. From cradle to grave, the journey is very short. Chen Yanyan plays the maid Xiaohong in the play, struggling reluctantly under the oppression of violence, spending her days in tears.</p>
<h3>Grand Light Screens "The Charge of the Light Brigade"</h3>

<p>Warner Bros.' war film "The Charge of the Light Brigade," which has been rumored for a long time, will be publicly screened at the Grand Light Theater starting today. During this year, we have seen American war films such as "Gold Diggers of 1935," "The Story of Louis Pasteur," "The Life of Emile Zola," and so on... But compared to this "The Charge of the Light Brigade," they are all "dwarfed by comparison." In short, this film has achieved amazing achievements in terms of performance. The cruelty makes people's hair stand on end, the tension makes people's blood boil, the eroticism makes people's souls melt away, and the sadness makes people's tears fall and their hearts ache. Moreover, at this time of national crisis, watching the six hundred martyrs on the silver screen charging towards the enemy's cannons, you cannot help but feel excited, you cannot help but applaud. As for the acting skills of the protagonist, Errol Flynn, they are also above the great star Colman. It is also heard that Grand Light, in order to particularly please the audience, will simultaneously screen the Technicolor cartoon "The Two Little Bears."</p>
<h3>Special Program of the Drama Friendship Society: Morning of Drama and Dance</h3>
<p>The Drama Friendship Society is an organization for drama practitioners to connect and foster relationships. Since its establishment, its work has been very intense. It regularly holds gatherings every week. The society has now scheduled a special gathering at 10:00 AM on New Year's Eve this year at the Carlton Theater, inviting Wu Xiaobang, the only artistic dancer in China, to perform stage dance. Dance art is still in its infancy in China, and this move is worthy of our attention. It is now learned that the society has printed invitations and distributed them to drama and film circles, as well as groups and individuals who love drama art, so that they can enjoy the event together. Drama groups or newspapers that have not received this invitation can send a representative to the society at 3 Xirong Villa, Huanlong Road to collect it, or call 72069 to inquire. It is said that there are not many tickets left, so those who want to collect them should do so early, lest they miss the opportunity.</p>
