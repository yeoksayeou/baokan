<p>時評</p>
<h3>减少人力車問題</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>本巿特區人力車公會反對工部局减少車輛運動。近來愈益積極。昨日各車主在市商會召集全體大會。通過五項决議。同時發表官言。指出「工部局當局建議减少公用人力車數。為圖實行其所經營的公共汽車的專利。而侵奪華人的合法營業。事關民族競爭及貧民牛計。應據理力爭」。</p>
<p>這個問題初看起來似乎並不怎麼大。其所包含的性質似乎並不嚴重。而其發動的中心。似乎也在於人力車的車主。但是。仔細分析起來。却覺得這是我國各都市一個普遍的問題。不過在上海性質特別嚴重罷了。</p>
<p>年來我國因受農村破產的影響。一般無衣無食的農民。不得不投奔到都市裏來。另謀生計。同時。又因工商業衰落的結果。城巿上大批失業勞工。不得不找尋門路。在這種情勢之下。顯出最明顯的一種社會現象來。便是人力車夫的過剩。人力車的不斷增加。一般車主乘勢抬高租價。予人力車夫以重大負擔。而車夫為兜攬生意。却對雇客儘量將車價减低。甚至人力車與公共汽車的車價不相上下。這樣的所謂「貧民生計。」實在是可憐萬分的。</p>
<p>因人力車數量的增加。與車價的减低。而直接受其影響的當然是專營的公共汽車電車等的收入减少。租界當局。為了這種關係。還為了「保持整潔的市容。」為了迎合少數高等華人的心理。才有减少人力車案的决定。</p>
<p>减少人力車。在現實的經濟狀况。人民生計社會組織狀態下。原不能說是合理的舉動。因為交通工具的使用。應該順應着當地的客觀環境。不應以獨占營利為目的。而减少人力車足使數萬人力車夫失業。促成社會秩序的不安。其在巿容上表面的益處。實在抵不過實際的弊害。從這一點。我們對於這决人力車公會的據理力爭。是表示同情的。</p>
<p>可是。我們從另一方面來觀測。却覺得此决車主反對减少人力車運動。太着重於車主本身的利益。假使車主眞是為了「貧民生計。」應該多方面體卹人力車夫的生活。把民族競爭和貧民生計的利益打成一片。不然。如果人力車也减少了。那結果一定是抬高了租價。增加車夫的負擔。而乘客的車價。則因公共汽車電車等的競爭。實在不能提高多少。卽使人力車不减少了。而利巿三倍的。也還是車主。說不到貧民生計的改進呢。</p>

<p>此决桑城失陷、雖無伊倫被佔時之血戰、然其為叛軍北部前綫總司令穆拉將軍之重大勝利、固不能加以否認也、按桑城之失守、早在一般人之意料中、故對於此次被叛軍所佔、皆不以為驚異、</p>
<p>桑城為西班牙最著名之勝地、平時歐洲各地人士之來遊者、為數極衆、允以瑪德里居民之來此消遣假日者為最多、該城自半島戰爭時、被英人破壞之後、卽行重建以迄於今、城中勝跋、除各設備完美之浴塲外、更有大賭塲及鬥牛塲各一、桑城本為主敎駐在地、港內有完備之船舶停泊所、平時航業甚為發達、又該城以前本為瓜浦發柯埃省之省城、惟目下該省省城已改為吐羅薩地方矣、桑塞巴斯蒂在歷决法蘭西與西班牙之戰事中、皆受損失、曾於一七一九年、一七九四年、及一八零八年時、三次被法國所佔領云、（十三日路透電）</p>

<h3>王克敏北來聲中　反映出的形形色色　（北平特信）</h3>
<p>被任為冀察政委會經濟委員會主席之王克敏氏、前决北來視察接洽後、南返已月餘於茲、在此時期雖一再有再度北來之說、而迄未見諸實現、然此間當局、固無時不在盼其北來、卽日方之身當折衝責任者、對王氏北來、亦始終取歡迎態度、惟在此普遍歡迎聲中、有兩種人最感難受、一為某方浪人之類、另一則為在浪人庇護指揮下之漢奸宵小、前决關東軍參謀長坂垣征四郞來平津時、此輩人物、頗盡謟媚放刁之能事、結果關東軍方面、在其旣定方針下、自允許給彼等以支持、於是得意志形、對王克敏此决北來之表示種種呌跳暄囂醜態、以企使華北中日間交涉、永遠不久常軌、而遂其「渾水撈魚」之私慾、蓋亦為必然之事、九月一日王氏動身北來、日方及我華北當局、始終未作明白表示、然浪人·漢奸·宵小輩所表演之種種醜態、固巳頗為可觀、茲略述如下</p>
<p>王克敏於一日由滬動身北上、消息一傳至平津時、此間浪人·漢奸·宵小之屬、乃卽大感不安、奔走會商、異常忙碌除一面製造三種謠言、（一）謂王此决北來、係受有某某密令、將使華北中央化、其謠言用意、在慫恿日方懷疑、（二）謂王氏北來、將以資力收買某某及某某之下級幹部、並將分化某某及某某二人間之關係、其謠言用意、在恐嚇華北實權者某某及某某二人、並使彼等及其幹部中人員、互相猜嫉、其計殊毒辣、（三）謂王此行携有鉅量法幣千萬元、將在華北行使、並運平津封存之現銀南去、此種謠言、用意在煽動一班目光短淺之華北市民、另一面又籌劃種種對王本人之具體抵制、如揑造名義、拍電拒絕其北來、如假借民　衆代表名義、奔走於此間中日雙方當局之門、請彼等對王勿示歡迎之意、卽其最著之二端、此時彼等之用意、在迎頭截阻王氏之北來、</p>
<p>不圖截阻之計未售、王於三日抵大連、並在該處與關東軍當局、及滿鐵當局會晤、而天津日駐屯軍之參謀專田且由津赴連、會商一切、一時華北局面、頗有展開之傾向、雖結果如何、尙未可必、然卽此朦朧之傾向、已足够使一班浪人·漢奸·宵小等輩、萬分不安矣、再加之十氏更有先赴瀋陽、逕與關東軍方　面接洽一切然後再來平津之說、於是此輩焦急之狀、格外可掬、除由彼輩指揮之報紙、對王私人作種種誹謗與中傷外並進一步準備種種實際行動、以作王之毅然蒞平津時之抵制、最可笑者、並拍電警吿王氏、謂「日方對華北經濟合作具體辦法、早已抉定、未俟王氏北上、早已著著實行、王氏如貿然北來、必將不得要領、」又謂「華北中日經濟提携、漸有相當進展，經濟界人士、均盼照現有計劃循序進行、對其北來、持嚴重反對態度、」其實皆製造空氣而巳、其用意在使王氏灰心南返、或至多滯留大連、不來平津、不圖此計又未得售、王氏終於八日由大連乘日輪抵津、於是彼輩抵制王氏之計劃、乃入於具體行動之階段、</p>
<p>王氏乘坐之　日輪長平丸、於八日上午十一時抵津岸、在未抵岸之前、卽有被收買之衣衫不整遊民百餘人、由數人率領、在碼頭附近、作種種擾攘暄囂之舉動、各入手執小旗、高呼雜亂之口號、並散發傳單、反對王登岸、其傳單所載、標題為「吿華北民衆書、」措辭頗堪發噱、而文辭亦頗拙劣、其中詆王為「官僚、」並涉及王氏個人生理狀態、逕稱為「瞎子」為「瞎鬼、」其幼稚固不値一哂、但彼輩對王北來着急之狀、固昭然若揭也、允可笑者謂王「想將華北變成一個紙票子世界、就合（原文如此）死人燒的冥鈔一樣、……請問我們華　北若沒有現金只剩幾張亂紙票子、還買得出飯來吃、合衣來穿嗎？」等語其用意顯係在愚弄一班不明紙幣作用之市民、故意用此刺激之語調、其實自去年幣制改革以來、華北居民、今非昔比、何謂法幣、何謂準備金、以及二者在金融上之作用、早已體騐認識淸楚、此等惡劣語調、除毫無影響外、不過適足令人發笑而已、而况詆王為運走平津封存現銀、又為毫無根據之信口開河、在傳單之末尾有下列幾句、「同胞們不分國籍的朋友們、請你們也表示同情吧、……快來快來、」其醜態尤為畢露、至於此等遊民所呼之口號、據傳共有十二個之多、但一按其內容、反來覆去、不過利用下列三點、（一）拚命將「華北」與「中央」二名詞對立、彷彿「中央」為另一國之政府、「華北」又為另一國之領士然、（二）拚命着重現銀與紙幣二點、以圖煽動一班目光淺短之巿民、（三）對王個人、拚命以毫不相干之惡語相詆如「瞎子」「走狗」「官僚」……等等、其實此種宣傳、在一班人方面所引起之印象、異常不佳、則其所得之反結果、必為彼輩愈胡鬧、而一班人擁護王氏北來之心、必愈為熱烈、</p>
<p>北平方面、於得知天津種種擾動後、此輩浪人·漢奸·宵小等、乃亦立呈騷動狀態、除已準備王氏萬一蒞平時之種　種胡鬧舉動外、並由彼輩四出揑造謠言、宣傳王氏在津所受之窘、以誇張彼輩計之得售、並由其指揮下之××晚報、飛印號外、謂天津方面、有平津民衆代表千餘人、拒王上岸、記者於六時許外出巡視、由東城至西城之各通衢、各小胡同、各共同娛樂塲所、及各電車道上、沿路均有孔面黃瘦、髮長二三寸、癮君子式之衣服襤褸人物、向人高聲兜售號外、售價極賤、而購者寥寥、蓋人一聞知其係擇館址於平巿公安總局緊隣、托其庇護之××晚報所出號外、均不禁啞然失笑，立刻知其所載為何物、而無需購觀也、記者十時後回來時、仍聞「號外」「號外」之聲不絕、足見其尙未完全售去、銷路不佳可知、</p>
<p>目前王克敏到天津後、對於彼輩隨意揑造「東亞協會」名義所提出之三項責問、已作極圓滑極開誠之答覆、對王之答覆、想彼輩亦無隙可乘、同時此間當局已佈吿嚴禁此類假借名義　之非法組織、謂一經查出、或吿發證實時、卽按匪徒聚衆騷擾地方論罪、想彼輩之氣燄、或可稍殺、目前彼輩有無新花樣可出、當繫於日方當局有無　協力取締之誠意、</p>

<p>經濟援華　須有合作</p>

<p>英大使館　暫不遷京</p>

<h3>九底十底先後將屆、各業充分準備穩渡　銀錢兩業收解已漸忙放款視對方信用而定</h3>
<p>滬工商業九月底秋節結賬期、及十月底信用放欵期、先後將屆、銀錢兩業收解漸忙、各錢莊秋季經理會、議定十九日舉行研究業務上興革事宜、茲詰詳情如下、</p>
<p>秋節將屆</p>
<p>九月底秋節（卽廢歷八月十五日中秋節）工商業結賬期轉瞬將屆、各工廠商號公司、對各往來戶均分發清單、辦理收賬事宜、因此銀錢兩業之收解漸忙、銀行業同業公會會員銀行、於九月三十日依照公會規定、放秋假一天、錢業同業公會會員錢莊、於九月三十日依照業規規定、秋節休假一天、·至於各工廠商號公司、是日亦均休假、整理一切、</p>
<p>各業凖備</p>
<p>自幣制新政策實行中中交三銀行竭力調劑同業金融、並扶助工商業、使其發展後、各業漸見活潑、同時各業鑒於市面之不景氣、對自身營業、已有充分準備、所以九月底秋節、决能穩渡無虞、至於銀行錢莊、對於工商業各項放欵、早已特別謹慎、所以九月底秋節、亦不致發生不幸事件、</p>
<p>錢業開會</p>
<p>錢業同業公會自奉則政部令改革業務後、每年分四季、舉行各莊經理會議、研究業務上應興應革事宜、今各莊業務均已逐漸改進、如仿照銀行制度、辦理保管業務。代理業務。推銷抵押放欵。吸收各項存欵。取消票現基金。聯合辦理各項放欵等等、今又定十九日下午二時、在公會閉秋季經理會議、研究興革事宜、</p>
<p>重視信用</p>
<p>滬市信用長期放欺、素分四底與十底、今十月底已近、各銀行錢莊暨寗波漢口等錢莊、放欵於滬者為數頗鉅、總在五千萬元以上、業已開始與各承借之工廠公司商號分別接洽，轉期。收回。新做。事宜、償銀行錢莊對信用長期放欵、因前受市面不景氣影響、受累匪淺、所以現在特別慎重、視對方之信用、决定收回展期新做目標云、</p>
<h3>全經委會議定　秋繭標準價格　以繅折為標準　廠商準備收購</h3>
<p>新新社云、江浙兩省秋期鮮繭、本月下旬、卽可登塲、全國經委會蠶絲改良會、已議定秋繭標準價格、各絲繭廠商組織機關、向金融界借欵收繭、分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>秋繭瞬將登塲</p>
<p>江浙兩省秋期蠶種、大都為兩省蠶絲改良機關分發之改良種孵育、兼之隨時派員指導新法養育、故蠶身發育頗佳、如浙江海寗。餘杭。蕭山。崇德。嘉興。等處秋繭、均將次第上簇、江蘇無錫。溧陽。丹陽。金壇。等處早帮秋繭已上簇、晚帮亦已大眠開葉、故兩省各縣鄉秋期新繭、本月下旬、均可登塲、屆時各繭行、亦將同時開秤、</p>
<p>經會標準價格</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會蠶絲改良委員會鑒於絲價暴跌、而秋繭上市在即、據各方估計、今年秋繭總收獲、約有四十萬担至五十萬担乏譜、如絲繭廠商、因絲價衰落、觀望不前、則蠶農損失、將不堪設想、反之、如秋繭扯價過高、則繭商亦將蒙受損害、該會代理主任委員譚熙鴻、為謀補救起見、特於前日在杭召開會議、當經議定今年秋繭標準價格，以繅折為標準、繅折自四百三十斤至五百斤、繭價每担三十二元至二十六元、繅折四百六十斤鮮繭每担二十九元、為中心扯價、通知各省市繭業遵辦、</p>
<p>浙省登記足額</p>
<p>浙省蠶絲紡制委員會、自公告招商收購本境內秋繭、舉行登記、於本月十日截止後、據悉該會此次共計核定全省繭行二百三十三家、繭灶一六六三乘，收繭額為十七萬四千八百担、故收繭登記已告足額、將無剩餘、至於所有核准寧記在浙省收購秋繭之絲繭廠商、須於五日內繳納保證金、每乘一百元、執有保證金收據及一切應辦之收繭手續完畢後、卽可前往產區、依照標準價格、開始收購、</p>
<p>廠商準備收購</p>
<p>上海。無鍚。浙江。等各地絲繭廠商、雖鑒於歐美市塲絲價下跌、但此乃受某國絲推銷影響、兼之某國本年秋繭產額、較前歉收、預料絲價不至再跌、故各絲繭廠商、仍準備收買、除向蠶絲統制會申請登記外、並分別組織機關、向中國、交通。中國農民。浙江興業。浙江地方。江蘇、江蘇農民、等各銀行。暨福源等錢莊、接洽借欵、大都均將商妥、其辦法與春期借欵相同、由絲繭商自備墊頭三成或五成、以所收鮮繭為担保、收繭時再由承借銀行派員隨同監視、各廠商借飲已成功者、均已定於本月二十日左右、出發收購矣、</p>
<h3>江浙絲織聯合會　將開第二次會</h3>
<p>討論內地證明撲照辦法新聲社云、江浙兩省絲綢機織聯合會、前因財政部對人絲交織品須憑人絲進口稅單、調換十貨運銷執照、方准交寄、曾召開大會、並向海關請願、現滬地已經本市綢緞業公會向海關請求、獲得解决辦法、在財政部未變通辦法前、得由同業公會證明、掉換運銷執照交寄、惟內地仍不能照此辦理、該會前曾令各地同業、擬具辦法、及當地情形、以憑研究、現各方報告者、已逾多數、該會為討論具體辦法起見、定本月中旬、召開第二次代表聯席會議、共商進行云、</p>
<h3>肅清烟民連坐辦法　住戶切結辦理完竣　定十五日起聞始總檢查　擴充醫院儘量收容烟民</h3>
<p>大公社云、本市禁毒禁烟總檢舉、自十日截止從、市公安局為實施連座辦法、肅清烟民起見、特進行全市住戶切結保證、特通令各分局區所、遵照進行、並限一星期內完竣、各區所奉令後、即由戶籍處調派長警、就該管轄境區域內隨帶表格、挨戶實施填寫住戶切結保證以來、經各區所之努力、均已辦竣、凡填過住戶門首貼有﹁查字﹂、以資標識、所有表格、呈報總局核示辦理、</p>
<p>定期險查　自本市烟民總檢舉工作、於本月十日截止後、總計登記烟民、（連自動登記領照烟民在內）數僅四萬三千餘人、以全市人口總數比較、不到百分之一、照抽象統計、多數固然避匿租界、但市區方面規避者、為數當不在少、故市公安局為澈底肅清烟民起見、特定於本月十五日起、通飭各區所辦理全市戶口總檢查、如在總檢查期內查獲之烟民或製造販運毒品人犯、則一律按照軍法處置、</p>
<p>擴充醫院</p>
<p>市公安局因鑒於烟民自動申請戒烟老、數達五千餘人、但特約及指定投戒之醫院有限、致未能儘量收容、使亟欲戒除之烟民、抱向隅之憾、該局為設法補救起見、特會同上海市禁烟委員會籌商擴充戒烟醫院數量、俾已申請之烟民、早日投院戒除、脫離苦海，</p>

<h3>法郎跌價　我國不受影響</h3>
<p>新新社云、法國貨幣法郎價格之慘落、引起國際金融市塲之不寗、新新社記者茲據經濟家之觀察、認為係由法國政治之不寗、及含有政治作用之罷工潮所致、乃一般資本家、遂乘機以政府防範資金逃避、將實施禁止、現金輸出之說、淆亂市塲、從中取利、故法郎價格慘落之現象、實係暫時、如政潮與罷工潮解决、卽可趨於平寗、至於法郎價跌與我國金融之關係、除對法貿易稍受相當阻滯外、無甚影響、</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<h3>使妻不滿足的丈夫往那裏去！</h3>
<p>……男子患早洩陰萎是永遠不能探求性生活的眞諦　……生殖器機能障碍與生殖腺內分泌要素的治療法</p>
<p>揭去了假道學的面具，板起面孔來說：夫婦的結合，雖然在表面是為的傳種接代，假若細細來分析一下，恐怕為了嘗試欲情中眞正快樂的一，幕喜劇比較來得眞切些吧！其决眞正能為民族福利的前途着想，能有幾個呢？的確，在這超格死亡率苟安的中國靑年，可有幾對夫婦眞能够享到健全性生活的幸福啊！而且罹有性器機能障碍的人們，實際上超過一般人意料之外，男女患者異常衆多，這是否能造福社會呢？</p>
<p>但是男子性機能障碍症中，最主要的，為早洩，遺精，夢遺，或陰萎等症。在研究其原因以前，實在有先考慮體質的必要！</p>
<p>患此種疾病的男子，以神經質乃至胸腺淋巴體質的人們最多。以外還有後天性的原因，例如少年期手淫過度，或花柳病經過後，或腦神經衰弱症的副症狀，冬罹患本症。程度上雖有輕重之分，但多數為腦神經及生殖器神經衰弱及其伴生之衰弱過敏症，合併發現。</p>
<p>本症第一的弊害，完全有損夫婦間的熱情，甚至陷對方於陣陣煩腦之中，家庭間的幸福喪失殆盡！所以有遺精，早洩，陰萎病的男子，假若不設法來治好，不是武斷來說一聲：縱然活到一百歲，也不能探求性生活的眞諦。康健的幸福，自然永遠休想，所以很要緊的一件事。就是趕快治療。關於治療方法，根據一九一三年維也納大學哈希曼氏與阿得策爾氏　Hitchmaunand　Adler，及一九一五年希虞得爾氏R．Schrlder等醫學博士的硏究，完全證實，以生殖腺內分泌製劑確能增强男女間的性能，助長生殖器的發育，此種學識，轟動於歐美的醫學界，旋由奧國生理學家司丹那氏硏究成熟，提取雄壯動物的生殖腺素，製成『生殖素』以治男子的早洩，陰萎，奇效立見，如兼罹遺精，再以『希米脫氏固精片』治之，短期即愈。該兩藥已被全球所推崇，値得介紹。</p>

<h3>遺精治法的推陳出新</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>最要緊的一句話：對於染手淫弊害的人，我們不用作無為的譴責，我們應當來硏究消減此弊的有效方法。有人僅聽見提到任何人尤其是剛成年的靑年能够成為手淫習慣的犧牲品，他們心中起了嚴重的恐懼，但這恐懼無裨於患者。</p>
<p>我們早曉得靑年在成熟的時期，差不多情願被手淫惡癖所操縱，而且在成熟時期內手淫的傾向較別的時期感覺的更當，所以在這期手淫的惡影響，自然是頂厲害的，旣能毀傷精關摧殘性力，而且害及全體。</p>
<p>最能顯示的病象，誰都曉得為遺精。遺精可使全身的營養减色，發育障碍，神經衰弱症深刻。如時日過久，變成滑精，神經系統要被侵害到無可藥救了。</p>
<p>犯手淫惡癖牢不可拔者，可以利用催眠狀態，與以暗示—這是最有效的方法。關於遺精和滑精，那末必須鞏固精關　，堅定意志，使夜夢淸少，精神旺盛。故倍利倫氏，福雷爾一氏，愛脫斯特蘭得氏等，皆一致推崇『希米脫氏固精片』為遺精病特效藥，三氏均為國聯會的醫學專家。至於被遺精所惹起的神經衰弱症和發育不全，可以生殖腺素內分泌製劑『生殖素』服之，就有很好的成績顯出。</p>
<h3>有效戒烟法的集珍（一）</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>鴉片因具有强烈的麻醉作用，故毒化人體的程度深刻，一且求求戒除，實覺困難萬端，遑論欲在不知不覺間，毫無些微的不快感覺，將衰弱老癮短期達到斷癮之目的哉！本醫師洞悉戒煙的原理，爰特將安全的戒烟實例，作集珍錄以嚮閱者，下文所載，均為黑海沉淪下的自拔者，關於戒除烟癮的經過，篇篇為寫實記載，如作臨戒時的參考，定可得到無限的實益，幸讀者勿以等閒視之。</p>
<p>—多病戒烟的經過—</p>
<p>患者無錫人，年卅九歲</p>
<p>為絲廠之工塲管理，每日須工作十二小時，毫無坐憇之機會，身體異常狼狽，乃藉鴉片以刺戟之，旋乃成癮，如是四載，烟量有增無减，同時頭腦脹痛，大便閉結，氣喘，耳鳴，精神大為衰退，實無力再能繼續其工作，旋為廠方辭退，乃為彼之前途計，從事戒烟，歷三十九天，完全斷癮，上述各病同時消滅，精神旺盛，體力增進，彼之戒烟方法，以眞正的生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』服之，並以『育維賜保命』注射，烟量逐漸自動遞减，經過絕無痛苦，至卅五日鴉片盡除，服藥至三十九天，始吿安全竣功云</p>
<p>淋濁自療</p>
<h3>淋病有效療法的操縱</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>疾病的就診愈早，則速獲痊愈的希望愈大，此為患者普遍盡知之常識，惟對於淋病，允為扼要。蓋淋病如在念性期內，即施以對症合理之治療，且少有染至尿道後段及併發病之危險。故凡會與娼妓往來之人，均須一律受一星期之周密檢驗，以觀其有何症狀顯出。上述之法，雖屬必要，然患者每為環境所限，尙灘普遍行使，故最認為簡效可靠之方法，在病稍顯疑似之期，或在淋病急性期內即立即以黃色素和伐克辛合製之『安敵淋』服之，則一切痛苦立即减輕，淋濁頓止，淋病上之有此特效劑之發明，實為德國JADASSOHN醫學博士埋頭廿三年的經驗結晶，非但有透膜殺菌之力，且服後能在患者之體內產生無數的抵抗淋濁菌苗，不論多年的慢性老濁及淋病併發病如睪丸炎，尿道炎，關節炎，攝護腺炎等，無不藥到病除，因效力偉大，患者之操縱遂予以不少之便利。例如患者名韋永康，年廿七歲，杭州人，彼所患之淋病異常猛烈，纏綿三載，痛苦備嘗，因誤於藥石，幾變成終身不愈的慢性淋病。精液大受損傷，面容憔悴，肌肉削瘦，於今年六月間得朋友之介紹，以『安敵淋』服之，不到兩月，濁止尿淸，病竟根治，同時因身體之損喪過度，服「生殖素」以根治其腎萎早泱之症，迄今已歷四月，精神充足，面色紅潤，肌肉亦逐漸發胖，此失足之靑年，竟得從新做人，可謂幸矣！</p>

<h3>不姙症月經病的女子一種有效挽救的方策</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士Y．K作　任國祥醫師撰譯</p>
<p>在婦女中一生的希望，就是能够生個寗馨兒，作母親。假若喪失了這宗優利，是婦女們一生中最厲害的失望，甚至於有因此而家庭破壞，或時常不快樂的。</p>
<p>不姙症的促成，實在常由於男或女生殖器道內有種毛病，男子性器對於不姙雖應當負相當責任，但是倘在婦人方面，找不出不姙的原因來，應當在男子方面仔細檢查所以無兒女的理山。</p>
<p>不姙是婦人不能生產的病症，若是不能受孕則視為『絕對的不姙』，若是能受孕而胎死，則視為『相對的不姙』。</p>
<p>胎死腹中不能活活的產出，有許多病症實尸其咎。大都由於子宮，輸卵管或卵巢有病，但是在本章中姑置不論，假若婦人不能受胎，除了生殖器構造不合式，如處女膜不開，沒有卵子，輸卵管和子宮，甚至陰戶也沒有等之外，則重要原因，厥為淋病，夫或妻有了淋病，男則睪丸受害，女則卵巢被毀，往往男的輸精管或女的輸卵管發炎，以至壅塞男人射精的孔這和女人受孕的原子。遇有這樣的情形，據國聯醫學團最著名的淋病學家威廉姆巴理期Internatina　Medical　Group　Dr．William　Bayless說：可以Jadassohn醫學博士發明之黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』Antirrhea　服之，（編者按上述之名，一為英籍，一為德籍。）非但可使淋病根治，仍然可以生出康健的兒女。</p>
<p>此外為錦女普遍不姙的原因，厥為月經病，月經閉塞，月經延期，均為婦女康健喪失的明設，唯一的後果，變為不姙的女子了。最可靠的療法，首推奧國生理家司丹那氏所發明的生殖腺素製齊「女用生殖素」了，幾乎被全球各醫師推崇認為婦女調經種子健身的特效劑，他曾得七國政府的獎狀，當然這七國政府是獎勵生育最積極者。男用『生殖素』同為彼所發明，對於滋補人體生殖腺有顯著奇效。早洩陰萎是喪失男子生育之敵，它可在極短期內完全治好，這種偉大的貢獻，無怪節育家認為勁敵。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>尅止骨痛的特殊效騐</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>骨痛一症，視患者身體衰弱的程度及年齡的高低而有分別。年老的人，比較一般靑年人為數烈，冬季較其他三季為惡化，且每在交節氣時期，必將症狀加重，過此會自動降但，幾為一般久病者自能揣知，此種具有時令性的骨痛，誠為年老力衰者唯一的難關，此外靑年人所患者，如屬於身體衰弱者，則每於工作後腰背酸痛，一度休息，痛即减輕，如屬於早年荒淫，血份不潔，則痛時感覺麻木，以四肢關節處為甚，如處理不當，可立陷於半身不遂之狀。</p>
<p>患者何明佑，五十二歲，曾罹遍體疼痛之症，一年四季永無寧息，惟時令及天氣關係，將病劃分為輕重之別，天氣陰濕，節氣降臨，則痛楚較甚，此病已歷十二年，迭治未效，今春經其同事介紹向永安公司購得『强期登氏骨痛片』服之，連服四盒，痛楚立止，同時手足輕健，骨節舒暢，至今已歷四月，從未感覺絲毫之骨痛，誠為久病者的良好借鏡。</p>

<p>早洩而萎</p>
<p>編輯先生：鄙人在未結婚時曾有手淫惡癖，旋雖戒除，然遺精不息，廿四歲結婚，因身體元氣大損，故即罹早洩，刻竟陰萎，請賜治法為幸　（孟力文）（答）可服『希米脫氏固精片』以止遺精，同時服『生殖素』以根治早洩，陰萎。無往不利。</p>
<p>胃痛陣作</p>
<p>主筆先生大鑒，逕啓者敝人早年飲食不愼，加之工作勞頓，胃痛陣作，痛時口吐酸水，萬分痛苦，近日食慾大受影響，身體亦感虛弱無力，請賜一有效療法，不勝幸甚。（王敏）</p>
<p>（答）可向永安公司西藥部購服『胃痛靈』以治胃痛，並服『健　素』助長消化。</p>
<p>性病講座</p>
<p>— 姚爾昌博士詹念曾醫師合編</p>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（一）勤於手淫精枯體虧</p>
<p>患者鄔福基，年二十一歲，羅店人，服務於某書店，因早年勤於手淫，故近年神經衰弱症愈陷愈深。（至訴）——一星期之內，至少有遺精三次，多者五六次，如或夜間失眠，則白畫在工作稍煩時即會滑精。（病歷）——鄔君早年中淫書之毒，十六歲時即染自凟惡癖，致年雖少壯，精力枯竭，體虧健忘，遺精頻繁，今春三月由彼戚之介紹前來診治，（診時病狀）——攝護腺異常萎縮，睪丸細小，並有耳嗚，腦弱，頭痛，四肢酸軟等症。（治療方法）——用冷却法並按摩，每日電療一次，並囑向中西藥房購服『希米脫氏固精片』治其遺精，服眞正純良的生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』補精健腦，根治其神經衰弱症，連服數盒，遺精早瘳，即覺精神倍增，精足腦榮，肌肉發達，體重頻加，食慾亦為之亢進，面色紅潤，與前較之，誠有霄壤之別云，</p>
<p>（二）早婚之害遍於靑年</p>
<p>患者許國英，安徽巢縣人，年廿一歲，受早婚之害，發育停止，竟至早洩陰萎，不能行夫婦之道。（主訴）——高小畢業後，即奉父母之命完烟，此時年祇十六齡，發育尙未完成，遽邇同房花燭夜，不到三月，並罹早洩，陰萎，間有遺精，身體瘦削，面容枯槁。（病歷）——許君秉賦薄弱，少即多病，自十六歲結婚後，因對方為一年長之女子，較許君大兩歲，年齡的不配合，生理上的性慾希求，雙方失其平衡，致鑄成大錯。（診時病狀）——不特早洩，陰萎，目更發育不全，性器與睪丸細小。並有遺精，致所患之神經衰弱症，不勝枚舉。（治療方法）——余診得許君生殖腺衰頹，內分泌缺乏，即對症發藥，囑向永安公司購『生殖素』以增强性能，幫助新陳代謝的促進，更新發育，消滅神經衰弱症。同時再以『希米脫氏同精片』治其遺精，不到兩月，諸病消散，身體强壯局部雄偉，岸然有丈夫風云。</p>

<h3>足球即將發動　各隊最近消息　靑華瓦解隊員改隷進德　東華主塲改在巿體育塲</h3>
<p>溽暑已過、秋令來臨、足球李節、已在磨拳擦掌、劍拔弩張之中、自本埠四人足球會報名截止、年會亦已循例舉行、賽期依照規則定在九月最末之星期六（卽本月廿六日、）關於參加本屆聯賽四十一新老會員隊之動態、常為全滬球迷所注意、茲略述如下、</p>
<p>兩屆各組　進退比較</p>
<p>上屆聯賽、計分五組、其編制為甲乙丙丁四組、各為十隊、其飴則盡推入戊組、計有十八隊之多、總計為五十八隊、又為天雨所阻、致各組均未能如期結束、本屆老會員退出者、計有去年曾列乙組亞軍之靑年隊、及丁組之特捕、星光阿卡廷等三隊、及戊組之維華、國貨銀行·電力·　　文·飛公·及工華等六隊、總計退出十隊、甲組上隊、木年仍繼續參加、未曾更動、新加入者、計有暨南·東光·聶中丞·進德·浙江興業銀行、及工部局中學等六隊、</p>
<p>靑年健兒　改隸進德</p>
<p>其中以去年乙組亞軍靑年隊之瓦解、最稱可惜、但靑年之一部份健兒、本屆已改隸進德麾下、故本屆進德實力、殊可注目、現進德主將、除靑年健兒許竟成·高錫泉·姜來臣等外、復有去年東華「輪流球員」張金海之加入、實力益增强勁、聞進德會會長周文彬君、已向西聯當局請求加人甲組、未知能否邀西聯執委會之通過、但至少常能列入乙組中、按進德會係中華書局職工所組織、非該局職員、例不能入伍、張許等近來已入中華任事、遂為羅致、並聞羅斗文君、最近亦有為該會羅致之訊、</p>
<p>東華改偕　市體育塲</p>
<p>東華上届以球運乖賽、致以十勝四敗、屈居季軍、木屆自捨申園而改假市體育塲為主塲之訊傳出後、巳受球國人士之注意、蓋申園對足球門票收入、大半依靠東華之號召、本屆旣改以市體育塲為主塲、申園勢將大受影響、而關於東華之木身問題、傳談不一、但究竟如何、各方常事人均尙秘而不宣、</p>
<p>暨南重振　優游才難</p>
<p>去年因故缺席之暨南隊、本屆已重振旗鼓、將繼續其往年霸主之業、但去年暨南健兒、大半歸入優游麾下、復益以小黑炭之北來、優游乃得壓倒東華、榮膺亞軍、本屆暨南旣重為馮婦、其去年暫離之健兒、當然歸寗母隊效力、故優游對於陣容之支配、已大感才難之嘆、昨據接近該會者談稱、優游本屆自知才力薄弱、已不作甲組之想、不久將向西聯當局、聲請加入乙組參戰、以期錦標之穩得、果爾、則亦戰略之取捨也、</p>
<h3>十平杯乒乓决賽　廣東勝瑯琊得錦標　四比三局勢緊張　第七組才分勝負</h3>
<p>轟傳已久之十平杯、業於前晚（十二日）在北四川路中央大會堂决賽、鐘鳴六下、觀衆巳陸續而來、橫浜橋畔、車水馬龍、七時許、作壁上觀者計千餘人、是時山上聯會委員李鳳池報吿、先山儉光與精武表演雙打、頗為精彩、結果儉光以　對　小勝、繼由朱葵生對朱建章二君表演硬球（世界標準）三局、迨八時正、瑯琊與廣東兩隊隊員戎裝登塲、稍事練習、俄頃由裁判員陳霖笙、一聲令下、卽行開始交鋒瑯琊百派名將竺永康出馬、三比一輕取區尙志、而廣東第二組容德能不甘示弱、以三比〇擊敗鄒國範、惱了瑯琊隊長陳振聲、還以顏色、亦以三比〇戰勝林慕容、而廣東又派猛將歐陽維、再以三比〇大破方克平、你來我往、局勢緊張、頃刻萬變、至是以各一比數，未分勝敗、第五組為瑯琊左手將軍張英、廣東則為遠凍名將盧仲球、交綏之下、張君憑其開球之巧妙、而勝第一局後、盧君藉其豐富之經騐、謹　應忖、卒能連勝二局、至此廣東反敗為勝、後來居上、第六組瑯琊為攻守俱佳之陸漢俊、廣東為後起之秀張志鴻、羣料張君必望風披靡、孰知戰來、頗為精彩、陸　費盡九牛之力、而以三對二之比數而勝之、於是冠軍之誰屬　繫於最後第七組之得失、豈料開賽後、瑯琊樂俊昌節節失敗、以〇此三見屈於廣東新將周子明手下、廣東遂為十平杯盟主、未由全國乒乓協進會顧問王伯洪先生、致詞給獎、廣東隊代表許崇業、含笑抱杯而去、</p>

<h3>冀察征消費稅之得失</h3>
<p>— 汪警石</p>
<p>我國工商業在近幾年來，不斷的遭受顚沛，毫無喘息的餘地。自從九一八後，東北的市塲被奪，相繼又轉入世界不景氣的潮流。加以國內農村水旱災害頻仍，更使工商業感受困難。而前年下半年起，美國的銀政策影響到金融緊縮，以及八月大量走私的開始，凡此種種，均予工商業以致命打擊。然而金融緊縮的恐慌，終由政府當局毅然改革幣制，租各方救濟得力，而安然渡過。走私雖曾猖獗多時，但在最近，也因緝私與各方消極抵制的結果，也稍形歛跡了。而國內經濟能力的昭蘇，自然在自身努力奮鬬，以達到生存的希望。但事實與環境，並不如此簡單。最近冀察政務委員會，對冀東僞組織區域輸入的貨物，擬在天津·北平·張家口·保定·石家莊·滄州·泊頭鎭·歧口等八處，設立稽查處，徵收按照海關正稅八分之一的消費稅，准在冀察兩省，及平津兩市自由搬運的消息。雖經工商各界去電查詢眞相。而當局僅有設立該稽查處，係調劑正當商人利益的申辯。如上項消息果成為事實，則此後貽害之鉅，實有甚於走私。而所申辯之理由，更難存在！</p>
<p>本來走私之所以發生，大多由於關稅的增高。我國自十八年起六年間前後曾改訂關稅七决，純為保護國內的實業。但走私也隨之漸决發生，此種固為事實所難免，證之以最近數年，如二十二年提高全部稅率後華北六港進口當時尚有二〇四·六七六千元，二十　年二度提高稅率後卽减為一六一·七七六千元去年父减一五〇·一三三千元再以本年六個月華北六港進口與去年同期比較。</p>
<p>觀上表本年華北六港之進口額，已由去年的入超一千二百三十餘萬元，一變而為四千四百九十餘萬元的假出超。這種出超的反而，就是走私使正當輸入减少所造成的結東。</p>
<p>而这次的走私，從實際言之，却又超於通常走私之外。因為走私發生的原因，第一是經濟的原因，走私的目的在圖利，如關稅愈重，則利益愈大，此為必然之事。但减低關稅或徵收其他稅餉，决不足以絕對的消滅走私，第二是地理的原因，凡一國的陸路疆界遼遠或海岸綿長，及接近鄰國，均可以引起奸商走私的舉動。第三為政治的原因，大多由海關組織的不健全，及緝私不力所致。但此决走私從性質上論，是有武力為後盾，完全是為外力所操縱。就形式上言，公然搬運而為公開的行動。則此項走私之目的，其用意無非欲借此項行動，以脅迫我國財政陷入窘境。在經濟上，使我國　業，永留於决殖民地的階段，無由前進。其用意之深毒，旣如此。如冀察政會果舉辦消費稅，以為關稅之替身，是正中其所欲，而被其屈服，此不可實行者一。</p>
<p>我國　稅的收入，在財政上佔百分之九十，而關稅中進口稅，又佔總額百分之八十以上，是進口稅在我國財政收入上，實佔璽要部份。在過去走私期間。二十四年一月至二十五年五月單就人造絲，白糖捲烟紙三項稅收，巳甚可觀，列表如下：</p>
<p>上述三項私貨，十個月來巳捐失稅收達三千四百萬元左右。又按海關報告，僅四月份一月中，損失達八百萬元。如依此計算，則每年須損失一萬萬元，合全部稅收三分之一。其决，如統稅亦因走私而减少。據報載北津統稅，本年三月份棉紗統稅尚有六七，四六七元，四月减至四九，八五九元，五月為四六，二五一元。捲烟稅也由三月的四二，二七二元，降至四月三九，六八〇元，五月三二，〇三二元。今冀察政會之征收消費稅，僅照關稅八分之一微收。則此後進口貨，勢必為大利所在，皆願由平津運入。是全國進口稅將盡變為八分之一的私貨？如以本年度的預算關稅收人三一七，九七三，五一四元計，豈不一降而為四五千萬元麽？此種措施之失當，其理由何在此其二。</p>
<p>我國自關稅自主以來，先後增訂關稅，均審愼週詳而後出之。一方顧全各國的通商，一方保護國內實業的發展。其於稅率的　訂，决不驟然出之。故我國從價稅最高僅為百分之八十。歐美列强的從價稅竟有高至百分之二百者，故我國稅率並不見高。至從最稅亦較他　為低，卽以走私最主要者之人造絲糖而論。據海關報告，我國白糖進口稅率最高每百公斤抽九，六金單位。德國為三十二馬克合十九金單位。英國合一三，二金單位，法國合三三，三金單位，日本每百公斤日金一四，六元，合一〇，七一金單位（指已貶値之日金，如在未貶値時的合三〇，九三金單位。）又如人造絲我國每百公斤抽一二〇金單位，德國合一三一金單位，英國合一〇一，六金單位，美國合一四七余單位，法國一五九，一六余單位，日本以現行匯兌率計算合七二，八二金單位，如照未貶値時計算則為二一〇金單位。據此而論，我國之稅率並不較其他各國為高。而走私者之指摘關稅過高者，固另有企圖，决非减低稅率可滿其慾望。况走私之利益，决不因减稅而無利可圖，除非免稅！，故减稅與不减稅，其於走私决難消滅明甚。至冀察政會之征消費稅，是否卽為减稅之舉？如果屬實，不但無補於走私，抑且自我破壞國家行政組織，而損害國家財政，此不可者　。</p>
<p>我國工業本未臻於繁盛時代，况又受外貨的傾銷和國內外廠的競爭，本己精疲力竭，而商業資本又薄弱異常。一受意外的摧折，崩潰立見。就過去受走私影響的記載觀之，如糖業上海北平一百二十餘家糖行因受私糖壓迫，行將全部停業，而國產砂糖無人過問，又使廣東糖廠相繼倒閉。麵粉業多以華北市塲為對象。近因私粉輸入華北，各埠存積，粉價大跌，粉廠因之一度停工减車以維血本。捲烟業也因走私而停工十六家。其最大之民族工業紡織廠初因紗銷呆滯，大多趨向織布，而華北走私的疋頭却又源源而來，農村盛行之藍洋布斜紋等類，又大半為其所奪。故華北紡織界更首當其衝，各大紗廠相繼淪入外商之手。卽全國紡織廠的停工錠數，半年間也較過去為多，如二十四年上半年為一，三四四，九八六錠，下半年一，三六〇，二七三錠，本年上半年增至一，五五五，〇一四錠。絲綢業在往年受人造絲之代替絲織物以來，我國之與絲業有關係者，如農工商皆蒙莫大的損失。今受私貨侵襲，其害更甚。據人造絲一項，在冀東僞組織，於三月一日實施秦皇島，南大寺，北戴河，留守島，昌黎五處設立辦事處後，對於私貨槪征收照本國關稅率五分之一至六分之一。所以人造絲的輸入，每箱二百磅以前須抽二百二十元的，現在祗四十元就可通過，較前减低一百八十元。漂白洋布，因通過稅的便宜，其售價也就低落三元一疋。砂糖一百斤也較正當的糖賤七元五角。最近上海電機絲織業曾發見私綢銷滬，曾呈請市商會設法。據謂近日到滬日有五六千疋，共來源為山東周村。明華葛的售價祗抵本市國產品同等原料的成本。中山綈的售價祗四元，如以相等的人造絲經海關征稅須四元二角，所以還不够稅金，從上項所述的幾種，是見正當的工商業是决然無法，可與之抗衡的了。</p>
<p>我國工商業的根基，本甚淺薄已如前言，今冀察政委會獨不瞻前顧後，而有這種輕的率舉動，實無異加緊了國內各業總崩潰的速度而巳，據此則稽查處與消費稅不宜存立者四。</p>
<p>就心上所舉的四點，不過是犖犖大者，足以證明冀察政委會設立稽查總處，完全失於週評的考慮，而據中央社七日北平電的由辯是「近來私貨充斥，市面大受影響，經數度討論，認為緝私方面，固應雷厲風行，惟偷漏之私貨，勢不能任其自由銷售，為兼顧事　與環境計，因　設立稽查總處，以期補救，其職務僅在稽查已經上陸之私貨，與海關方面並無衝突，　緝私得有妥善辦法後，私貨無從上陸，則該處自無存在必要，故該處設立絕無另立新稅則之事一云云。據此以論，則稽查總處之設，頗似輔佐海關緝私能力之不足。假定如此，自然為國人￥歡迎。但他的職務，是處理巳上陸的私貨，對私貨行使處罰，却並不是將私貨人證交由海關辦理，或將全部私貨沒收，或令其補還稅額。這顯然是另一組織，對於海關毫無補助，而且很明白的與海關劃分了疆界！本來海關在海上緝私遇有困難時，還可在陸上行使他的職權。如今有了這種組織，倒反替私貨增加了一種保障！况且就過去的事實而論，私貨的來源，多由冀東經北寗路到天津，都在陸路的範圍以內，海關旣無從過問，試問妥善辦法，從何着手？那來稽查總處也就相對的存在着，是毫無疑問的，其中更謂漏私各貨，勢不能任其自由銷售。內容當然是征收消費稅，走私者旣納了稅，自然可以暢行無阻。如此，則正當的貨將盡受輕稅貨品所侵奪，所謂「調劑」與「維護」正當商人者，究何所指？</p>
<p>綜括以上所述，不但危害財政上的稅收，與破壞海關行政。而且迅速地可以使華北工商業淪於萬刧不復的地位，卽全國的工商業，也感受到草大的威脅而無法維持！</p>
<h3>蘇聯所得稅制度的演變</h3>
<p>— 任幷廉</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>所得稅是種嶄新的賦稅形式，是資本主義高度發展的產物。英國是最先採用所得稅制度的，其時還是十八世紀的九十年代，誰都知道英國是資本主義的祖先，所以產牛得特別早。六十幾年，後，在美國也採用了這種制度，繼之者是意大利（一八六四年），日本（一八八七年），法國（一九一四年）和德國。最近，連决殖民地的中國也有採用所得稅的擬議。自然，中國並不是資本主義的國家，施行所得稅是吾有這樣的可能，而且是否於民衆和國家有利，澴屬疑問。不過非資本主義的國家而採用所得稅者，郤並不是自中國始，蘇聯現行之稅制，也就有所得稅。</p>
<p>然而在蘇聯所施行的所得稅，與資本主義的所得稅，在本質上顯然是有分別的。雖然在技術上，兩者還有若干共通之點，像需要一個完備的社會統計簿記制度，即其一例。沒有完備的統計，在征稅上是會發生極大的困難的。資本主義高度發展以後，無疑的正有了這完密的會計制度，所以，所得稅制度之產生於資本主義的社會，是一點也不足奇異的。</p>
<p>資本主義的所得稅，依舊是一種剝削的賦稅制度，雖則在表面上牠是種直接稅，牠的稅率是累進的，但是道並不能使貧富的負相因之而平均，原因就是在於資本主義的生產手段已操之於少數人的手裏。他們弁賦稅上旣有較大的支出，自然在生產上就有較大的剝削的收入。所以，這負担依然轉嫁於勞働者的身上，這是毫無疑問的事。</p>
<p>社會主義的國家己經沒有剝削的制度，它的生產工具不是操在少數人的手中，乃是操之於勞苦大衆，工農無產階級的手里，這末一來，賦稅制度在蘇聯已經不是一種剝削的形式，所得稅自然亦非例外。</p>
<p>不過，所得稅在蘇聯之施行，也不是完全沒有它的特徵的。</p>
<p>蘇聯所得稅的特徵，第一，對於所得人，採取嚴格的階級差別課稅。第二，獎勵社會化的經營，施行課稅上種種特典的賦予。這特徵，跟資本主義的所得稅是截然不同的。</p>
<p>蘇聯是個社會主義的國家，賦稅的主要點是在：第一，以顧全工農無產階級的利益為前提；第二，使工農業及各種生產部門之集體化，極力消減個人的小經營，消滅殘餘的資本主義；第　；用賦稅的形式去使貧富的負担平衡，以至消滅階級的界限。所得稅這嶄新的賦稅形式，在這裏自然也同樣是担負着同一的任務的。</p>
<p>所得稅在蘇聯的演變，是跟整個社會的變革有極密的連系的。本來，從舊俄時代起，就己經有實施所得稅之擬議，其後因為社會和政治的變亂，所以沒有成功。—然而舊俄是一個資本主義的國家，與蘇聯的社會制度是互相背馳的，因之其施行的方法，跟今日的蘇聯也就自然兩樣。</p>
<p>不過我們要追溯蘇聯社會經濟的變革，以及其影響於現行的所得稅制度，郤不能不從舊俄時代說起。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我們已經說過，所得稅是資本主義的產物，所以它的產生，必須在資本主義成熟之後才有可能。在俄國自然也是如此。</p>
<p>克里　戰爭之後，俄國資本主養開始抬頭。在十九世紀的六十年代，俄國財政制度遂隨着資本主義之興起而開始變動，從前對建性的財政制度，於是慢慢被新的制度起來代替。以所得稅制度來代替舊式的人頭稅，也是從這個時期開始醞釀的。</p>
<p>一八八七年，俄國廢止了人頭稅，稅收自然减縮，財政當局不能不　闢新的財源，以彌　不敷支出的經費。於是在一八九二年有提出創設所得稅之議，結果未被採納。後在只在第二年施行了一種新的稅制！住居稅，這稅制含有强烈的人頭稅的色彩，不過牠的稅率倒是累進的。當時其稅率的規定是：從和賃價格的一一·六七％起，累進到一〇％止。以一·六七％之課稅為平均最低額，而一〇％之課稅則為最高額；在一定的價格以下之住宅，在當時是可以不入此列，而准予免稅。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，俄國資本主義之未趨成熟，是可以想見的。十九世紀末葉以後，歐洲各資本主義的國家都己經漸漸走人飛黃騰達之境，俄國資本主義在這時期也有了驚人的進步，大規模的企業組織巳經不斷的出現。在這時期，財富愈集中在少數人的手里，資本家，企業家的利潤，由於工業的發達之故，日益提高，於是，薪俸生活者及勞動者的人數也隨之曾盛。這不用說正有了適合於俄國施行所得稅的客觀條件。於是俄國政府也從這種社會經濟情勢之中找到了它的新財源。所得稅遂局部開始被採納。當時首先施行的是股份公司稅和薪俸稅。</p>
<p>在當時，對於所得稅的採用，依舊不是沒有人反對的，其中反對最有力者，為當時的財政部長維特（J．Witte），他舉出了七大理由。認為：</p>
<p>（一）國民一般敎育程度甚低，難就所得獲得正確的申報。</p>
<p>（二）一切公私的會計不完備，難有調查所得的確實根據。</p>
<p>（三）由於前兩項的困難，要作確實的微收，必須加以相當重大的强制，因之對於納稅者之個人自由，大有妨害，而且益易使稅務官吏，陷於不合事實之任意推定</p>
<p>（四）因之，也可以引起漏稅的弊病，對於國民道德，將發生懷的影響。</p>
<p>（五）富裕的國民，佔極少數，必至需要多數之徵收費，而稅收所獲極微。</p>
<p>（六）所得稅足以阻礙資本之蓄　，妨害產業之必要投資。</p>
<p>（七）所得稅須於他項直接稅已有充分的改革後，方可以採用。</p>
<p>這些理由，當時也就成為政府的考慮之點。我們說過，施行所得稅之先，一定要有一個必要的條件，那就是：要有一個完備的社會統計簿記制度。因之，維特氏所指出第二項理由，自然也首先使俄國政府在施行所得稅中所發生因難了。</p>
<p>俄國是一個後進的資本國家，所以多少總保持着一種先天的落後性，後存完備的統計會計制度，亦卽其一。這　果，至令所得稅之施行一直到一九〇五年所憲法之公布，財政組織之改變，以至於一九〇七年以後二·三·四次國會之討論，都還沒有把它列入法規之內。</p>
<p>這樣一來，所得稅制度在俄國遂成為難產的嬰兒，迄一九一四年，殘酷的世界大戰發生以後，一方面由於政府需要巨大的戰費，同時也由於火酒專賣的廢止，和鐵道關稅的减縮，國家財政，頓時感到枯窘。於是所得稅，居然又成為國會所討論之中心問題。隨後才因之而於一九一六年四月六日制定所得稅法，在一九一七年開始實行。</p>
<p>當時制定的這種所得稅法，大抵是參考了普魯士的，是採取綜合課稅主義，所以含有很濃厚的人稅的色彩。它的稅率，從對於年所得八五〇盧布而課以〇·六％起，累進到四〇〇·〇〇〇盧布以上而課以一二·五％止。但在年所得未滿八五〇盧布者，則予豁免。此外尚有數種准予免稅之規定，及種種特殊之扣除等。</p>
<p>可是實行了所得稅之後，舊俄政府依然無法維持財政收支之平衡，戰費之籌措亦加重了政府的負担。二月革命的爆發，使國內的政治經濟愈形紊亂，臨時為了籌劃巨額之經費，遂發行了六十億盧布的短期國庫證券，和四十億盧布之自由公債，並且以一九一七年的四月起，在所得稅之課以三〇％之加微。由於濫發紙幣之故，於是造成了盧布之陸續跌落，使人民的負担越發加重。而盧布之跌落，又影響到戰費額之增加，財政上之需要益加龐大。在道種情勢中的臨時政府，遂不得不尋覓一種新的財源，這樣就產生了一種臨時的非常所得稅，於一九一九年六月施行。</p>
<p>可是這稅制的實行，只維持了幾個月，也就隨時臨時政府的倒台而中止了。蘇維埃政權代替了臨時政府而出現，所得稅底稅制的規定，於是也因之又經過了一次變革。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>十月革命以後，所得稅的施行，在俄國是一個轉換的革新時期，經濟的變動和政治的改革是有着連帶的關係的，由於蘇維埃政府掌握了政權，俄國的國民經濟生活自然也就有了新的改變。</p>
<p>在軍事共產主義時代，是蘇維埃政府的嬰孩時期，羽毛還未豐滿，在這時候所遇到的困難，是可以想見的。第一是受着國際帝國主義的包圍；第二，要和國內的反動勢力作鬥爭。道時期的蘇維埃政府比較臨時政府的財政負祖還是重大，而其籌措也越發困難。當時的主要財源，只是强制微發產物，處理國有財產，沒收富農和資本家的財產，以及發行蘇維埃的紙幣……等。除此之外，蘇維埃也就只有從租稅上去找尋財源之一法。因之，改變舊有的稅制，遂成為當時的主要對象。</p>
<p>在改革稅制中，所得稅的主要改革是：規定一定的數額以上的大所得全數沒收。其時在莫斯科和列寗格拉之規定大所得的標準為：以扣除所得稅之稅額後，所得在七二，〇〇〇紙幣盧布為最高限度，超過這限度卽行後收。由於這個緣故，在一九一九年三月以後，所得稅的累進稅之收入己大大的增加。這在蘇維埃政府的財政政策上說，在當時是一個頗不少的收獲。</p>
<p>十月革命後的第二年，政府曾頒布了一種非常革命稅，其性質是和所得稅相同的，不過它的目的只是在於對於私資本之强制徵收。可是其結果，郤並沒有多大的成效。所以於一九二一年二月就被廢止了。同年三月，也廢止了穀類之强制徵收，課以收穫額一〇％的現物稅。這時期，是從軍事共產主義到新經濟政策時代的轉換。</p>
<p>新經濟政策實行於一九二一年。是年六月，政府就採取了一種營業稅，貨幣的租稅也漸漸回復。新經濟政策的施行，是蘇聯從飢餓，疾病與痛苦中脫逃出來的一個大關鍵，所以這一時期的財政政策，是頗値吾人之注意的。</p>
<p>為了救濟當時的飢荒，政府不得不設法籌劃一批巨額的救濟費，而當時的財政又正陷於窘境，所以，唯一的辦法，只有在租稅上再想新的財源，後來遂於一九二二年徵收了兩决市民稅，結果居然能够達到預定之數額。而且也由於貨幣的租稅之徵收，使當時的社會經濟回復到貨幣流通經濟的狀態。這是蘇聯財政政策的一個轉機。</p>
<p>新經濟政策實行之後，由於私企業之急遽的發達，「暴發戶」（Nepman）在中小工業佔着很大的勢力，政府為了消彌和壓抑這種勢力的抬頭，於是在一九二二年十一月十六日，卽新闢了一種所得及財產稅。這稅制於翌年改稱為所得稅，它的賦稅標準是以所得額和財產額為準繩的。</p>
<p>第二年的五月政府廢止了以前對農民的直接稅，總合為一個單一農業稅，以後凡負担單一農業稅的農民，就可以免除其所得稅的負担。一月後又採取了一種特別所得稅，道是專為國家企業，組合企業和公私混合企業而設的。</p>
<p>一九二五年，蘇維埃政府處予國營的生產事業以新的刺激，使生產力日益增加，所以極力壓制着私企業的擴張。這樣一來，租稅政策自然也要適應着這種情勢而予以改善。因之，一九二六年力月，遂有所得稅及營業稅之修正，一九二十年四月，有單一農業稅之修正，以及十二月所得稅之重新修正……等。隨後又於一九二九年十二月，將國家及企業所得稅，從以純益八％的稅率提高到二〇％。並且先後於一九一九年十月和一九三一年六月，兩决補足和修改所得稅的規定。使它更符適合於蘇維埃政府的財政政策，以及有利於蘇聯經濟之發展</p>
<p>这次修改以後，卽是為今日蘇聯所實行的所得稅制。而蘇聯的經濟，由於工業之日益發達，業已漸漸臻於穩定，所以所得稅便不復像軍事共產主雜時期那來成為籌劃經費的一種手段和方法，而成為今日蘇聯稅制中的一種賦稅形式，並且，其與資本主義的賦稅的根本的分別，也就不難從它的演變之中想見。</p>
<p>從下面的一個表裏，我們可以很淸晰地看到所得稅在蘇聯的演變。而且還可以看到它在演變中和金租稅收入的比率：</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （閻重樓）　　祇要是感覺比較靈敏的人，他都會知道現在已經到了新秋。　　然而一樣的新秋，對於人們的感想却文人們会打算寫一點抒情的詩文，農人們會期待着不遠的收割，漁父們會準備網羅那肥魚和大蟹，給老饕們嘗那新鮮的美味，而一些窮苦的人們則會想到天氣漸凉，但自己的夾衣棉衣還一件都沒有置備！……　　人，也可以說就是時令的縮影，時令有寒暖，人心也有凉炎，時令有春秋，人身也有老少，時令有轉移，人性也有變化。是時令適應人而變動呢？還是人適應時令以生存呢？　　有人說：春天是青年人的，冬天是老年人的，那麼秋天就可以說是中年人的了。中年人到了這新秋，也許會感到年華似水，生命將要漸漸地衰老了！　　秋天是收穫的季節，但是我在過去却沒有播下種子，也沒有勞力耕耘，現在我祇能眼巴巴望着別人筐裏的果實纍纍，為了想在來年的秋天有一些收穫，在今後我應當怎樣計劃做一點勤苦的生活呢？迎秋  君美　　幾陳斜風細雨，把人們在苦悶的夏季中，輕輕地曳上了新秋的初段，而另換了一番景色，清麗的，幽淡的日子。　　秋，除了少許風風雨雨的日子，足以撩人愁緒以外，大部分光陰，都在十分曼妙中過去，白天，高高的一片晴空，羅紗樣的雲，溫和的太陽，輕淡的微風，晚上，像金鈎一般嬌小或團扇那樣痴肥明月，雲影，飄飄盪盪的，像層層波浪在掀動，像段段羅綺在開展，尖銳而幽細的蟲聲，抑揚頓挫地自遠而近，吹進了耳管裏，這樣具着畫意詩情的季節，我們還不能引起欣賞而祇與悲怨之感啊！　　春天是游玩的季節，夏天是睡眠的季節，那麼這個不寒不暖的秋天，正是我們青年讀書的季節，我們可以悠然地喝着亦甜亦苦的清茶，我們可以愉快地抽着也香也濃的烟捲，穿着單杉，在小榻五，燈前月下，讀我們所語要讀的書，我們不會再因汗水淋漓而眼覺模糊，也不會再因芳菲滿目，而心亂如麻，即使幹其他的事，也比較心平氣和，爽快多多了。　　我們該怎株消劇道僩美麗的秋天，讓它不至於像夏天那樣輕輕地溜去。秋之漫筆  秋郎　　一年四季中，有和暖的春，炎感的夏，凉爽的秋，冷酷的冬，它老是這般的循環流轉，永無停止的時期，但人們對於「夏」和「冬」的來臨，不是畏熱，便是苦寒，而那和暖的「春」，有時也會悶得令人感覺不適的，惟有這「秋」季的蒞止，最迎合羣衆的心理，所謂「秋高氣爽」「已凉天氣未寒時」，多麼贊美的句兒，何况更有那「七夕」「用中秋」重陽」那麽多的良辰，都巧落在這季節裏來點綴着，秋！你該是個幸運兒吧？　　秋是受人推崇極了，但也不是偶然的，像澄潔，幽靜，澹雅，明朗，這都是它情性的流露！其他金風，玉露，霞彩，月華，又那一樣不是精彩的表現！若論它的踪跡，也許生在山巅，水涯，枝頭，籬邊，更擴展到，霜晨的笳鳴，月夕的砧聲，牧童的牛背上，美人的書樓中　　秋所賜予我們的，是三徑的黃花，滿林的紅葉，足供我們的欣賞，尤其是紫蟹，青菱，大快我們的朶頤，我們得到這些，愈覺秋的可愛！都願睡在秋的懷抱裏去，我們的心靈，已和秋融成一片，恬靜，幽閒，在那風晨月夕的當兒，正不妨持　賞菊，淺斟低酌，這其閒的樂趣，真是充滿了詩情，畫意。」　　可是美妙的秋光，艷麗的秋色，風景與往昔一樣，但人事全非，今年却不允許我欣賞，我的周遭，祇有凄慘！悲愁！一顆受了深切創傷的心，和一雙含着滿眶血淚的眸子，對着秋容，　是煩惱！悵惘！喲！我可憐的慈愛的尊親，竟先秋而西歸了！遺留下這孤的獨我，寂寞地被摒案在秋風中憧憬罷了！菱  陳亮　　偶然在街頭小販的藍筐裏，見到了新鮮可愛的水紅菱，平常我對於紅色的東西，會感到蠢俗而不快的但水紅菱的色澤並未使我引起這種感覺，正好像一個有着潔白肌膚的美女，披裏一襲紅紗衫兒，微笑於新秋的晚風中，更覺其秀色可餐了。小販怕它被烈日曬，在籃筐浮面薄鋪上一層碧綠色的水草葉，紅綠陪襯，正是一幅水彩靜物畫材呢。　　畫「案頭清供」的，每喜用飽醮洋紅的筆，在黃色的佛手，或硃色的北爪：半邊，畫上兩三隻水紅菱，瞧去是怪有清雅味的。　　城隍廟茶樓上，有人剝水紅發肉放在瓷盆裏，兜售給茶客吃，生意很不錯。原因是一般人食懶，把菱買來一隻一隻剝出再送到嘴裏，認為是討厭的事，所以大家買現成剝好的菱肉吃了。我不歡喜這樣，我情願自己剝痛了指甲，才覺得其味格外鮮美。從痛苦中得來的食糧往往雜這樣的。　　從水紅菱又聯想到故鄉的綠皮菱，形狀略小，角刺却比餃銳長，嫩而甜。我家屋子旁邊本有着一個魚塘，魚是早已不養了，每年都給二嬸母家栽菱，菱盤密佈得滿滿一池塘，大伏裏開出黃花，一朶一朶被稜形的翠葉扶托着，花瓣像是蠟製的，夏日回鄉，我最愛於晨霧裏着經過夜露的菱花，覺得幽靜勝於水仙，或者這是我癖好的偏見？　　我家在上鄉（近山地），池塘不多，所以栽瓜的多，栽菱的少，物稀為貴，二嬸母家的菱就成為衆矢之的了，尤其是孩子們，日夜想偷來吃，菱花還沒有謝，上早學的孩子就赤脚翻菱盤了，二叔父是好好先生，常帶笑的站在木柵門裏說：「小老爺，菱還沒有結啦，可別把菱槃翻壞了啊！」孩子一哄便走散了。　　大約不上半個月，又好吃到二嬸母帶出來的熟菱了，我思慕着故鄉的土產。　　秋季始業校門堂堂開無錢莫進來  　　秋鐙雜寫  叔範　　中年作客，雖似野僧，而懷土之念，彌復深切；時序交換，情思亦隨之遞變：幾闌，兒女相思，我不到家，兩地各守燈火，此一悲也。子規啼矣，對他人慕，亦為沾中，而獨無分家祭，此又一悲也。入夏，念故鄉瓜事熟矣，一年刀還，此正其時；於是連宵有夢，與白髮訴道塗也，與吾妻話離懷也；及夫炎畫剖翠，凉階酌月也，莫不清景如真；而秋風投抱，我復忽忽不果歸。籬豆花開蟋蟀在堂，最難為懷之際，將作歸臥虛齋三日計矣；而又以買金告盡，卒不果行。從此江湖着夢，靡不可哀，一覺驚殘，惟痴凝雙眸，報答家人耳！　　初秋花草之最清麗泥人者，無過籬豆，牽牛，及萬蘿松，藍皆品高絕俗，不芳而自韻者。紫白雜間，隨意　妍，曉飲清露夜覆啼恐；如岩居之士，不求聞達，而猶樂於為善；此籬豆也。老安淡妝，自甘樸野，無絲毫黑情介乎其懷；一若卞玉京久隱黃　了，卻當年綺夢者然；此牽牛也。綠髮方穠，紅脂亂點，非為悅己者容，而自愛好出乎天然；此如湘蘭之垂簾清坐，不發凝妝者；則　籮松也。寒家隙地不多，修箿老樹而外，絕少奇葩，點綴令節；惟每屆商颼送暑之候，籬頭架上，頗作艷意，取其栽值較易，而又足以養　性靈也。日暮涉跡，負手徘徊，見夫髮亂情景，宛然翠袖天寒時也。若豆花與牽牛，則又似野老女冠，超然世外者矣。自我行脚，徙倚有誰？此三數薄卉，雖仍逢時擢秀，恐未必為兒侄輩所甚喜也；斜日田園，我思何限！　　物類清靈，最愛草蟲；絡緯莎雞，尤通人天至情者也。白月三尺，悲歌四圍，使疆場餘生當之，則攬衣泣已。床下哀吟，露邊苦訴，使空閨思婦處之，則掩袖啼已。亦有幽憂顛困之士，聞此聲肌妻然曰：此皆吾徬皇舌端喉間欲吐而不能者，胡渠若是曲折盡致耶？惟物通靈，以聲逆意，覺凉宵景物，無可樂者矣。故秋月雖清，未必鈎愁；秋氣雖嚴，何關墮淚；着此繁哀，於是月露星辰，胥為其助，若喪家盛張素幃麻衣也。隣有酣舞者，飫耳莫非艷聲，疇宵倦居，聞促織，輒告人曰：此聲大佳。嗟乎！偶此清賞，彼以為樂，即其所悲，皆在身世家國以外者也。往歲，吾聞秋蟲，所感止於窮達；自疆河日蹙以還，蟲鳴愈哀，而吾之所感亦愈深；旅危餐露，凜乎若不可終日。或曰：徒悲不如發憤。則應之曰：不悲何由知恥，不恥何由振作？此吾因蟲寄臆之又一說也。換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第六回　鐵面見親心語瞞鸚鵡　蛾眉存俠氣問典崑崙　　友梅站到他身邊輕輕搖撼着他的手臂，笑道：我猜着，你這分愁肩丕展的樣子，事情總是有點兒事情的。不過你能不能你我當個知己的朋友說出來。這倒是難說。夢蘭道：你不必用這激將的法子了。在一個星期以前，我就打算告訴你的。不過我一念到這件事，是現在過渡時代應有的現象，在我心裏頭腐爛掉罷了，又何必去惹別人的眼淚呢？所以我仔細想過之後，還是不說。友梅聽着，就走上前來，握住他的手，低聲笑道：那你還是告訴我罷。我願意陪你流幾點限淚的。說到了這裏，他就挨近了夢蘭緊緊的靠着。又低低的道：你說你說。夢蘭道：你今天在樓下來，看到家父沒有？友梅道：看到的，夢蘭道：他老人家臉上，帶得有笑容嗎。友梅笑道：他老人家，總是那樣鐵面無私的。夢蘭道：那未，你想罷，我還說什麽？他說了這話，把嘴向前一努。友梅向門外看去，見那走廊子上，有－個人的衣裳角。便道：那是小菊坐在那裏，不知道拿了什麼針活在做。夢蘭於是將桌上的紙筆，寫了一行字，含惰欲說宮中事，鸚鵡前頭不敢言。寫完了，把筆一丟。友梅對於他這分難言之痛，倒有些慘然；站在椅子邊，對了桌子上那張字，倒很費沉吟。將鞋尖在樓板上連速的點了一陣。便低聲道：既然如此，你就什麽話不提。我心裏也就明白了二三。你若是有什麽事要我做，還是那句話，我一定帮忙。夢蘭道：帮忙是少不了找人的。不過我希望你不要對第二個人說。友梅笑道：你的心事，也沒有對我提過一個字，我對人說些什麽？夢蘭道：有要找你帮忙的時侯，那我不用人說，一定會來我你的。只是我想着真到了那樣一天，我的身世就不可問了。所以我想着，我或者不會有那樣一天。說時他就搖了兩搖頭。友梅道：聽你的口音，心裏頭倒是真有一肚子苦水。說着，微偏了頭，緊緊的皺了眉頭子，將眼睛向他斜　着，臉上也現出沉吟的樣子來。夢蘭倒微笑起來，向友梅微微點着頭道：你不用猜了，我的心事，神仙也猜不出來的友梅笑道：我雖不是神仙，但我也可以猜出你多少心專來的。王說到這裏，小菊捧了一把茶壺進來，對着兩人微笑。夢蘭道：你笑什麽，你躲在外面聽我們說話呢。你怕我不知道嗎？（七三）南塘三絕  南丁　　每至新秋金風送爽之時，正荷花塘中，結實上市之際。荷塘出品，共有三種，荷花的果實，便是蓮子。荷根生莖，即為塘藕，加以塘中所產的鷄頭，也合成三種味美絕倫的佳品。但此三種佳菓，因產地的不同，滋味大有分別。同為蓮子及藕鷄頭，有嫩甘香糯與老淡粗硬之別。蘇州的南塘所產，最擅勝名，不是別地可以相比，因此到了秋初，凡是作姑蘇游者，大都要帶些南塘出產的蓮藕，分贈知己。　　蓮子便是蓮蓬中的子，蓮蓬却是荷花所結的果。當炎炎三伏時，荷花盛開，清風送香，別有一番凉味。到了初秋，荷瓣漸落，便結成了蓮蓬。每一蓮逢，包含着數十粒蓮子，清香甜嫩，十分可口。但是蓮子有白蓮，紅蓮的分別，南塘出產白蓮，最宜於生食，紅蓮蓮殼微紅，宜於收實，即是在南貨店內所出售的蓮子，以湖南出品為第一，名為湘蓮，平時所食的蓮子羹，就是湘蓮，不是鮮的蓮子。大都蓮子食法，可分為生熟兩種，生食便以蓮蓬剝子，去衣嚼食，其味甘香，不過祇限於嫩的蓮子，倘採取失時，蓮子已老，便覺得老而且淡，味同嚼蠟了。熟食又可分為兩極，一種取嫩的蓮子剝肉，入湯一沸，卽加冰搪而食，不失蓮子香味。一種却是用老的蓮子，文火煨爛，和以冰搪，滋味之佳，勝過湘蓮百倍。　　藕，雖有雪藕之稱，而作為炎夏的食品，但是最多的時候，却在初狄。有塘藕，田藕分別，田藕遠不能比塘藕的嫩脆甘甜，尤以甫塘出品，最有盛名。好歹的辨別，在於嫩老，甜淡，大概孔小肉厚的藕，可作為上品。有一節，兩節，和三節幾種，一節的最佳，三節的最次。藕的食法，除了生食之外，有幾種都成美味。以藕用鑤鑤之，取葛布瀝汁，便是藕汁，飲之有清熱凉肺止血的功效，所以國醫，常把藕入藥，作為治肺之用。以藕切片，塗麵粉和塘，入油氽黃香脆可口，謂之藕餅。藕的質地，含一種澱粉，藕片之下，多有這稱粉質沉澱，便是藕粉，冲水加糖，可厚如粥糊，也很清香，而且用了絕無渣雜，用於病人，異常相宜。藕老之後，甜味與鬆脆均失，粉質則多，製藕粉最佳。蘇州南塘的藕，因甘脆而嫩，利於生食。他處亦有以藕加糖，或妙菜成肴藕的其味盡失，這一種藕，都是劣品。　　鷄頭是生產於塘中的果實，葉大於荷，平貼水面，夏日開紫色的花，秋季便結成了球狀、的果實，每球包着鷄頭數百顆，殼紅而圓，其中的肉，白如珠子。南塘所產的鷄頭，殼簿肉大，味糯而香，因此稱為上品。但是剝殼極費時間，實是喜食鷄頭的人所恨。南貨店內，所山售的芡實，便是已曬乾的鷄頭肉，也以南塘為第一，因肉質較為柔糯。鷄頭食法，最普通的有兩種，一種剝肉之後，入沸水和冰糖一沸即起，香嫩異常，湯色微綠，色香味三者俱佳。只是在剝肉後切忌沖洗，多煮，一經冲洗，香味便失，多煮肉老，所以在剝的時候，必先將手與鷄頭洗爭，煮時先將水煮沸和入冰糖，再入鷄頭之法，一滾便入，方可得到鷄頭所具的美味。還有一種食法，却是把肉搗爛，和水和糖，煮為粥狀的糊湯，名為鷄頭粥，年老的人，最屬相宜。至於芡實的食法，則須用文火煨爛，不與鮮鷄頭肉相同。康健之路  康健醫藥社主編從藥理作用上斷定淋病的療法  日本帝國醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師　　粘膜細胞的變化給予有力的證據　腹膜內注射所生的喰菌現象　　吾今不欲以普通常識，述明淋病之某種療法為可靠，某種為不可靠。亦不欲以四言八，句，陳述一病以迎合低級趣味，而藉此誇張。竊思曩年留學日本帝大，昕夕所攻習者，為花柳科。花柳症險梅毒有六〇六及軟性下疳有特效藥外，惟淋病獨無確切治療。因而淋病之猖獗彌甚。故彼邦名流學者教授等，研究殊力。而世界各國學者及專家，更為大加注意。經過無數人之探討，卒由德國彼得傳士總其大成，而發明淋病聖品「克淋儂」一藥。　　今請言「克淋儂」的藥理作用。惟讀者須留心體會，因此處所言乃高深之最新學理也。　　凡慢性淋無論男女患者，及攝護腺炎，睪丸炎（男）子宮炎。白帶。陰門淋（女）等，其粘膜細胞有顯著之變化。此變化可自組織的檢查而得：普通之圓往細胞自島狀變形扁平上皮細胞，在服「克淋儂」後，其細胞即呈正常狀態。而進服六星期左右，即全然治愈不復發。試騐此藥理者，有Bumm，Jadassohn,P.Gohn，傳士—　　又取淋菌注射于馬之腹模內，其淋菌腹水毒力及反戀性特强。苟餵以「克淋儂」粉劑，腹水中白血球即大呈喰菌作用與抗菌現象，淋菌即頓時死滅。余用「克淋僱」掃除人類患者全身淋毒，莫不根本肅清。但婦女淋毒白帶除服「克淋儂」外，以兼外用「卡而雪地」為陰道坐藥為佳。二者固全無刺激云荷爾蒙製劑中之新彗星  俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師　　催增發育　挽救性機能衰老　　人體發育不良，性機能的早衰，其原因不外內分泌機能之减退或失常，致身體各部，因得不到此項荷爾蒙之供給，遂不能達到正常之發育及自然之衰老。百病從此叢生。　　此等病息之對症療治，以內服荷爾蒙製劑最為適當。然荷爾蒙製劑在此百餘年來，種數出品已不知多少，均未能達到為吾人理想中之效果。余曩老於俄京莫斯科勞動大學醫科時，博覽世界各國內分泌學雜誌書報等，一致推譽德人梅倫氏發明之男女兩用荷爾蒙製劑『補體康』『補女容』二藥，為荷爾蒙製劑中之新彗星。此二藥之原料他先選擇勇健青春期之動物，用科學新方法揀出紳粹之荷爾蒙，凡粗雜不純之成分一概提凈，因若稍存雜質，反將有用之荷爾蒙减低效用而成廢物，『補體康』，『補女容』二藥，疊經各國政府化騐，確為品質精純之荷爾蒙製劑，故服後功效迅速而持久。逈異凡品。凡因早年手淫，色慾過度等而來之發育不全，下部矮小如兒童，性能减退而來之遺精早洩，勃起力弱，或完全不舉。頭痛失眠，心悸健忘，腰痛脚弱，早衰易老，髮白額紋滿布，服『補體康』於四五星期，即將性組織，加以徹底改造，更能補給全身所缺乏之荷爾蒙，使新陳代謝機能加速，發育正常，前述各種性神經衰弱之病，遂能完全獲愈，余在莫斯科實騐多年，歸國後亦恒用此藥治愈者，為數已數千矣。能發生特殊效能之治淋新藥  陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師　　效力無遠不屆　直搗菌巢　　淋菌，人人皆知其頑强之下等微生物，熱之不死，寒之不斃；此菌更有一種善於奔窠之本領，由生殖器之局部部分，投窠全身，凡有陳可乘者，彼必乘之，如與一個未患淋病之人接觸，則此淋菌如獲新大陸，向外發展，淋病極易傳染他人者，其原因即在於是。　　故根除淋病之治療，必須具有特殊效能之藥品，服後使全身細胞皆發生一種抗毒素，不論淋菌匿藏何處，皆須受此種藥之包圍而殲減之。德人彼得氏所發明之『克淋儂』一藥，適具上述條件，不論任何頑强淋菌，服『克淋儂』後，即在短期內使體內各細胞起抗毒作用，共同發揮總攻擊之殺菌力，直搗菌巢，將所有淋毒球菌，掃數滅盡，絕非局部之透膜殺菌之姑息與頓挫療法可比。且不妨害健全之組織，及絕對不障碍胃腸，刺戟腎臓等流弊。是為『克淋儂』之特長，為任何淋藥所望塵莫及者。余曾用此藥治愈遠年淋病，及初起淋病與淋病之變症等，悉在五六星期內治愈之。（初起急性淋，服三星期左右可愈。）猶憶余前曾赴南洋羣島旅行，寓於友人處，有金姓病人罹淋病多年，且染及其夫人，歷服各國淋藥而未奏效，後經余介紹『克淋儂』至五星期而全愈，其夫人之白帶，亦經余囑用『卡夫陰道片』為坐藥外，更內服『克淋儂』，服用四星期，遂獲全瘳，此『克淋儂』奏效之證也女性的神經衰弱  楊道南醫師　　不孕之源——　　婦女之神經衰弱症狀甚多，如頭痛眼花，耳鳴失眠，心悸亢進，神情抑鬱，記憶力，記銘力皆呈極度減退，性情變更，恒因小事而亦惹起悲觀，或暗中偷彈淚珠，背人飲泣。凡四周之環境，無一物不為惹起其愁思者。目光黯淡無神采，其續起之病狀則有食慾減退，營養不給，皮膚蒼白，貧血，月經困難，不能按期而至。或由量少而至停經，遂為不孕之主因，此外眼之四週有深藍色之黑圈，白帶下注，陰道爛潰，而來小便與房事之困難。　　婦女如有此種症狀，其家室大多甚融樂，甚至夫婦愛情從破裂而作勞燕分飛。即不然其家庭之幸福，亦必為此病所吞噬也。此病之主因，實因缺少荷爾蒙而起，惟梅倫氏所發明之『補女容』，可治愈之。此藥係由女用荷爾蒙所製成，故對於女性神經衰弱，月經不調及停閉，久婚不孕，服「補女容」後，即可卓著功效。因「補女容」有亢進內分泌機能之效果。曾經克伯斯博士等加以實騐，對於神經衰弱等症，確可奏效，余在俄京時曾治托拉納夫人患神經衰弱，月經不調等症，服後輙在數星期之內獲痊。惟女子白帶等，必須用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，內仍服「補女容」以發揮，二藥之功效故其成績非常優異，久為歐美人士所推賞也。手淫症之挽救及非手淫之遺精由於何故？  南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師　　據長濱繁博士之研究，謂一滴精液，等於二十滴血。據此，喜以手淫自戕者，其為害殊不堪設想。夫精液與神經系統，有特異之關係。手淫或房勞過度者，輒有神經衰弱症，而來遺精。久之則輸精管失其控制力，遇勞動與大小便及情慾興奮時，精液即奪關而出，是謂之滑精，精液漏，而早洩，陰萎諸疾，亦於焉踵至矣。　　遺精之合理療去，近世學者均以「鎭攝神經療法」為首。蓋此為治本，而固精為治標也。故遺精以服「耐而斯遺精片」為第一要義。請言其理：　　Vannod敎授謂手淫遺精，為生殖器神經衰弱De　Christmas博士則以非手淫遺精為先天不足荷爾蒙缺乏所致。而Wagner醫師謂房勞之遺精為末梢性神經過敏。其結論則皆以鎭攝神經為絕對療法，故當服「耐而斯遺精片」鎭攝之。因此種功效，善能嬌除不正之情慾，所以有　止手淫之作用。因神經之過度興奮與末梢過敏消失，精管亦恢復控制能力，故服此藥無論何種原因之遺精，滑洩，每週遺精五六次者，均可治愈。最好同時兼服「補體康」旺增體力，起其陰萎，則收功彌速！肺結核筆談  前南洋醫科大學敎授鄧源和醫師　　診所：書波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時　　余於肺結核，關係可謂至密。蓋余昔年在醫大講授時，即喜殫精於肺病學。嗣長滬南平民醫院，治療之癆病咯血者益多，皆獲特異成績。實亦初料所不及　　今述一病案於后，以備讀者參考，免致臨病失措。　　有湖州籍吳鼎君，學界，年二十三。患肺病已經兩年。初因秋日傷風而起。咳嗽數日，服〇〇糖漿無效。後喀痰即見血液。經醫者予以調治，血略止。餘症照舊。夜間盜汗，下午微熱，且訴胸痛，食慾缺少。每晚幾乎全失眠，並有遺精症，身體贏瘦。如是者年餘，百治罔效。經友介紹來余處求診，經用X光檢查，右肺幾全壞，左肺第三至第五肋骨間有浸潤症狀，打診音濁，聽診發水泡音（如A圖）。投與吐根丁幾Tinct　Ipeca杏仁水Apua　Pruni	Armeriaca等，咳雖减，未見確效。乃投服「補肺拿爾」約三星期，喀痰及胸痛均除，食慾增進。乃囑繼續服用。一方兼服「補體康」旺盛體力，補腦補血，而復以『耐而斯遺精片』治其遺精，八星期後諸恙全愈，體重增加，精神暢適。月前拍攝X光，肺部固已完全根治矣（如B圖）A圖　　未服『補肺拿爾』前兩肺之結核病灶B圖　　服『補肺拿爾』後病轉到消失姚菊巖醫師淋病講座　　診所　四川路寗波路轉角　診時　上午十時至下午六時　　生殖機能之毀滅　　生殖機能之毀滅，在淋病患者，最為常見。因淋病之地位，多在生殖器部分。例如患淋毒性攝護腺炎，精囊炎，睾丸炎等，皆足妨害生育問題。故患上項症狀乾，必須妥為治療。就中以尿道周圍膿瘍一症，尤能根本毀滅生殖器，此種症狀多由於患者在尿道炎時，失於治療，或有因醫治時施行手術之不當而起。因吾人尿道粘膜上，有許多毛細小管，此小管能通過海棉體，若淋恩斯特在此等粘膜上繁殖發炎後，而不將其從速撲滅，則此種淋菌更作深一層之侵略；從此等小管侵入海綿體。便又在海綿體上繁殖徒衆，遂成尿道周圍炎。而終極之結果，變為結締織，生成黃豆大之硬塊。或更化膿而致潰爛，生殖器亦由此而致缺損，或全部　去，實淋病中極可畏之險症也。　　然患者每在未化膿潰瘍之前，來余處治療，亦可使之轉危為安。住林肯路李作相君，久苦淋病，嗣以飲酒過勞之後，症狀忽見加劇，排尿時痛如刀割，乃乞余治療，經檢察之後，見其海綿體組織炎症至熾。大有化膿成潰之傾向。急令患者安靜勿動，投以「克淋儂」以减輕炎症而扑滅海綿體上之淋菌，更轉用電氣透熱療法等，先後治療五星期，覆診三次、始獲全愈。此症如再延宕數日，生殖機能，以被毀滅無餘。李君之病，亦云幸矣。白帶之有效療法  陳少華醫師　　防腐殺菌，為主要療法。　　白帶是婦女界中極流行之一種可厭病，患者下部穢液涓涓而流，日夜不絕，以致局部糜粉爛，甚者因細菌之侵襲，遂至化膿成潰，子宮卵巢等處，悉受此白帶之影響，而妨害其受孕之工作，故罹此等白帶病者，十九皆有不孕之危險。故務必及早治療，庶免他年之悔恨之。　　「卡而雪氏陰道片」一藥，為防腐人世間菌止泌之治帶良藥，每明臨睡之前，取一片挿入　道內部，次晨洗去即得。此片對於白帶，富有防腐殺菌，及制止分泌之菌能。且用時毫無刺戟，每個患有白帶之女子，均可在家自療，毋須請求醫生。但如因淋毒性白帶者，可內服「克淋儂」筐道仍用此片為坐藥。其因白帶而引起月經不調者，可兼服「補女容」，則所患即能全部治愈，永可不發矣。慢性氣管炎之欬嗽　老年人之哮喘  武鍾麟醫師　　凡久咳頑痰症，乃由氣管炎化慢所致。本症初得之于傷風，因失于治療，則釀致慢性氣管炎。患者終年欬嗽，遇氣候稍變，欬亦加劇，咯痰或黃厚，或薄白，喉部瘙癢，每引發腐敗性氣管炎，或氣管擴張症。老年人置秋凉季節，哮喘恒致復發，喘息心悸，欬痰交作，面色青白，呼吸困難，為極帶危險性之症候。　　余遇此等呼吸器症候，輒投以「補肺拿爾」藥，其效如鼓應桴，良以此藥為具强除痰鎭咳之特效藥。無論何種咳嗽痰餘症，如傷風，久咳頑痰，小兒百日咳，老人哮喘，服之無有不愈。最好以此藥與男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」並服，以療肺部，而壯體力，則不出四五瓶，即可全效矣。怎樣使食慾與營養增進  武鍾麟醫師　　有初期之胃病患者，恒苦食少胃脹，嘈雜作酸，消化不良。或雜藥妄投，貽無窮之害。或視為小恙，不加醫治，致延為痼疾。日久年深，營養為之缺乏。或陷於惡性貧血，或轉為胃痛，胃下垂。潰瘍，擴張等惡症。　　有許多胃劑，雖能促增消化，惟其成分不過酵母等品，而無營養之功，則因其缺乏營養鹽也。查「强胃精」一藥余試之極效。蓋其不但因含有酵　等消化素，以治慢性胃腸炎，口苦臭，飲悶。胃痛。嘔吐作酸。見食生畏。大便瀉洩。或便秘，屁多等症，並因富營養鹽。維他命AD，故其營養價値甚大，能解除一般虛弱胃呆及老年便閉症。又因含維他命B，故兼善脚氣。讀者園地　　下列各藥，均經國內外醫科大學畢業醫師實地試騐，證明有效。購服者務請認定藥品名稱，切勿誤信人言，而購雜牌廉價劣藥，致增病勢而危害生命　　遺尿　浦東三墩張善成君：遺尿症乃膀胱括約筋弛綏，服「補體康」三四瓶自愈。　　短小　江西鄱陽嚴子卿君：陰器短小為先天不足，可服「補體康」。　　淋病　本埠樂居易君：老白濁封口，睾痛，可就姚菊巖醫師行X線及最新「抗淋血清」治療。未治前服「克淋儂」自能根治。　　遺精　蘇州胡訐君：遺精每週四五次，須服「耐而斯遺精片」，其失眠早洩，眩暈健忘可服「補體康」安補神經。　　吐血　漢口楊叔軒君：吐血潮熱咳痰等，為肺病，服「補肺拿爾」自愈。　　夫人月經不調，經來腹痛，孕，宜服「補女容」即瘳。　　惡垢　蕪湖HT君：尊夫人淋毒白帶，腹脹，月經不調，宜外用「卡而雪地」為坐藥，兼用服「克淋儂」除淋及「補女容」調經為佳。　　讀者如有疑難各病，請附回郵，並詳示尊年，寄上海武定路八六九號康健醫藥社，當卽照答。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言開學了  芳　　中元節已過，各個學堂，又先後開學了。現在有的已開，有的未開，大的小學較早，而中學大學較遲，這是規模所範就者也。惟在開學之先，父兄家長，要大祖其心事，因為要遣子女出去讀書，就不是容易的一伴事。假令在內地讀書，學膳宿較省，倘在滬上讀書，學膳宿三費就不得了，倘非富有之家，而子女的書，又不能不讀，讀，則其讓書之費，將如何籌措呢？　　好容易讀書的費用勉强彌補好了，試問讀書能讀多少時間呢？三個月。一學期雖名為半年，其實除了星期，除了各種紀念日，除了兩季的運動，除了小考時的預備，除了寒暑假，試問還有多少是讀書的時間呢？並且在三月之中，該學堂敎員還可，敎法還可，課程還可，當可稍微得着一些好處，假定遇着一個「學店式」的學堂，此種出了一身大汗所籌來的學費，不是付諸東洋大海麽？靑年寶貴的光陰，不是白白送掉麽？　　現在暑假方過，我且再來談談暑假，在此長日遙遙的暑期時間，至少兩月，多則三月，學生放假歸來，差不多都有奉旨不讀書，奉旨白相之概，在一萬個學生中，能彀溫習校課，能彀自修自修，此種學生，我不能說沒有，也不能說不多，我想必定是少數。此種精金美玉的時間，白白浪費，何等可惜，何等肉麻。　　更有一層，滬上是萬惡之藪，而現在的學校，對於管理方面，談不上嚴緊，竟可說絕無，於是一般不習善良的學生，每於課餘之暇，不是出去看影戲，便是出去學跳舞，不是出去招異性，便是出去學浪蕩，於是滬上種種的惡習，幾如梅毒的傳染，雖打六〇六亦難以除其根矣，學業未成，惡習盡染，此種學生，卽使他日得了文憑，亦是社會的棄物，有何用處？　　而上海又是一個畸形發展的地方，討飯，流氓，苦力，果然甚多，然洋房汽車，富商豪賈亦所在多有，大菜館，廣東館，天津館等等，山珍海味，羅列几前，大公司，大商店，大商塲，綺羅錦繡，光怪陸離，陳列窗櫥，眼睛旣經看大，描頭亦是甚高，而一切生物的艱難，與謀職業的不易，完全並不想到，此種靑年，一種此毒，比患了虎烈拉還要難治。　　諸靑年其愼之，母忘家庭樸素的家風，母忘父兄籌措學費之不易，母忘他日失業的痛苦，母忘他日到社會上去做人的為難，母忘今日到學校裏的本旨，現在讀書，學費旣如是之貴，讀書的時間，又如是之少，而一般有誘惑性的惡習，如又是其衆且多，倘使諸靑年不立定脚跟，打定注意，則一失足成千古恨，再回頭是百年身，恐亦來不及了。吃虧與勝利  尤其　　為了年紀輕什麽都得吃屬，在當時，那「吃得虧，忍得氣，安身大寶，這類的格言，根本與自己無緣。可是，「吃虧」却總是事實，對於家裏的弟妹之問當然不要說起，趁祖母不在面前的時候，說不定隨了他們的高興，會拿了竹筷子或者小棍子之類的東西，頻頻地敲在自己剃得掙光的頭上，同時他們的嘴</p>

<p>裏在發，　在笑，據說是仿照了老和尚敲木魚的辦法。對外，吃虧也是常事，像北屋裏住的三毛子那傢伙，那麽點的年紀，會有一把好力氣，隨便的被他敲幾下，簡直算不了什麽、心裏想，你打我，好，等老子練足了氣力，不把你凑個臭死——　　因為這，那一次在許多的小眼睛緊張的情况下，我們在交起手來，起初，打了個平手，雖不是什麽三百回合，至少也有十幾個照面。之後，因為想顯露一下自己的眞實本領，在許多人的慫慂之下，我們接受了「三攀兩勝」的提議，猜拳，結果他先打我，第三拳打中以後，眼裏亂冒火裏，倒退有四五步遠。好小子，看我的，動足了氣力，一下，打得他站不住脚，第二下，大概他覺得太極了，把身子一偏，頭衝在胸口上，一個根頭翻出去，你瞧，氣槪就有點不平凡。　　可恨的，就是門口擺小攤的那個嚴七，每天，看着他攤子上買進了不同的貨色，花花綠綠地，引誘着弱小的心靈，嘗試的念頭不停的在轉——　　——老嚴，喊他一聲，再看一下他的臉：賒兩個子兒怎樣？　　——那可不成，眉毛動了一下，像想什麽心事：去，媽不給錢，跟奶奶要　　——有朝一日我也擺個小攤子，要吃得順嘴流水給你看。哼，不賒，誰希罕，這樣說着悄悄地走開了。　　不知怎麽一來，那回同了遠道來的舅舅走了一趟天橋，引起我莫大的興趣，覺得不論那一個賣藝的塲子都有他本身存在的價値，尤其在各項不同的吃食，給了我無上的好感，於此，管不了家裏的警告，凑一個空子，偕同了三毛子，還有什麽大禿，小順這一帮？就會往天橋跑。沒錢，不要緊，肉饀油煎餅二個子一張，弄兩張五個入吃，讓嘴層沾點油也好。　　彷彿脫了牢籠一樣，從天橋的終點逛遍了整個的忠，最感到奇怪的，是賣蝎子藥的那個高個子，在瓶子裏，他隨便的揑出了一隻蜴子，放在膀子上，蝎子在爬，存蓄了豐富的毒液的鈎子刺上了他的肉皮，他沒有感覺，放大了喉嚨宣傳着藥品的效騐，不管是已經被螫或者是預防都極其需要的。後來，他請求着觀看的人不妨試騐一下，但，大部的怕受了意外的襲擊，只相互的對看一下，沒有敢嚮，包好了的藥包呢？却飛進了人們的手裏。　　——這並不希奇，也許你們要認為我在作假，隨便那位可以自己帶來，也是照樣的。末了，他還補充這麼幾句，不用說，那是想堅固購買的信心。　　蝎子，在江南是看不見的，在種類上也分了許多的類別，紅色的火蝎子螫了可使麻木，靑色的呢？螫了會忍不住的打滾，最厲害的要算雙鈎，據說能够致人於死命的。　　路上，打不破這個謎，我們不相信他的藥會有這樣的靈騐。好，「隨便那位可以自己帶來」，非裝去一隻試試看才成。一個禮拜一霎眼過去了，結果我們沒有失望，香姻罐裝着弱小的動物，率領了班人馬，做賊一樣，溜出了家門　　一次，兩决……那高個子照樣隨用那一套老花樣宣傳着，錢和藥粉也照樣的相互交換着。眞的，那是在了他的意想，當得意的时候，三毛子把罐裏的動送上去，自然，他是不便拒絕的。鈎子在他的皮肉上動，他的膀子也動，可是，他還勉强的笑，汗珠，綠豆樣的由額間滾上頰旁。　　那一天，他收市收得很早，跟着，兩三天都沒有再擺攤子。效騐，騙鬼—　　為了這　，我們在嚴七的攤子上取得了預約的勝利的　利。河上  耶戈　　襟河柔靜着，初秋的搬風在蘆葦尖和白楊枝頭輕輕的掠着，　出了娑娑的抖響聲。　　天氣很陰沉，有時稍為從那灰黑的雲層里，射出了幾縷輕淡的陽光，懶懶的吸舐在柔靜的水波面外，大半便是在陰暗的低氣壓下。兩天前下邊了幾陣秋雨，氣候就突然變得陰凉了，然而，這對於行旅者是完全適宜的。　　這河非嘴寬廣，水流是那麽平靜，泛着深藍色。在河底正中，就像星棋般的羅列着一畦一畦長方形的蘆葦叢，這蘆葦，從襟河鎭出發的那天，我們還沒有看見，可是在這兒，就慢慢地繁多起來了。　　承載着我們底船夫，是一個三十左右歲的中年男子，身體高大，雄偉，滿面叢生着鬍子，面現赤銅色，作三角形，說話聲非常沉悶，好像一塊鐵拋打在潤濕了的泥地似的。他不大常開口，他是習慣於回答簡短字句和沉默的。　　那個狹隘的館房，在一天一夜的生活中，已經把我們悶窒得够了。於是，我們便爬着出來，在艙口坐着。船走得非常的緩慢，寂靜的河水被船板衝撞着，發出了低低的嗚鳴聲，這呌聲有時便擴大了起來，水珠沫兒就隨着高高的飛濺到半空，又作着霧狀的落下來。　　我們默然地把眼睛向着這方，透過了河中的蘆葦，透過了岸邊的白棉，在遼遙的岸邊，就有一片廣闊的大平原。這平原就充塞着田園，農舍，禾草園以及低弱的牛嗚聲。……　　忽然有一種尖脆的聲音，在空中轟鳴着，我們驚愕着，馬上便被吸住了。回過頭，向那發出聲音的地方看去，離我們的有十丈左右，有一羣野鴨子，驚慌而雜亂地鼓着翅膀，大聲的嗚呌着，從一叢蘆葦里飛起來，疊在半空打迥旋，有一陣濃烟像霧氣般的把它們罩住了。　　我們用疑問的神氣向船夫看着，他剛在沉靜地抽着烟袋，兩隻銳利的跟睛，就漠然地向發出聲音的地方看去。沒等我們來得及開口，他便淡淡的說着；「這是農戶們在獵野鴨子。……」　　「這兒也出野鴨子？」我底同行者俊驚異地問着。　　他把頭點着，從嘴角把烟袋拔出了，才低低的喃道：「這兒出的，每年一到了八九月間便有了。……他停了一會，又用手指一指河中的蘆葦叢說：「你們沒有看見這兒蘆葦，它們都是農戶特地種來供它們作窠兒用的。……」　　「他們獵了野鴨子作什麼麽用路？」　　「用路多着呢。」他微笑着答「毛可以作羽扇子用，肉醃着作下飯菜，也常運到外邊去的。……」　　「幹這活兒的，很多吧？」我挿着嘴問。　　「從前很多，差不多沿河岸材子的農民都幹這活兒的，現在就差了。………」說着，他很沉靜的在烟袋里裝上了滿滿的一斗烟絲，劃亮了自來火，便呼呼的抽吸起來了。「去年這兒鬧過了一决　　　年靑人像發了瘋似的鬧着打地主，分縠子，後來　　　走了，大家怕官軍來算舊賬，便也都跟着走了。………」　　「這兒田地現在不都是沒人耕種嗎？……」「不！還留着許多婦人家和老人，她們也還能幹，什麼都比從前不同了。……」　　槍聲突然又起了，煤臭味的濃烟瀰漫滿了全河面，有一羣野鴨子就吃驚地嗚呌着，在空中飛旋，準備飛進另一叢盧　里去。可是沒未來得及它們這樣做，第二　槍聲又響了，有一隻花白色的野鴨子在空中打了幾個迴旋。又絕望地拍一拍翅膀，便墮落下來了。　　有一陣驚喜的呼呌聲，從蘆葦里滿溢了出來，接着是一艘小舢板像箭般的飛撞出來。上面就突然的站着一個着黑衣袴，頭包圍中的健壯婦人，她底身上背着火藥袋，手里握緊了一把火藥槍。站在她背後的，是一個十三四歲的小孩子，他很吃力地用兩隻小膀子，划動着手中的槳板。她們向我們冷淡的看了一眼，便又若無其事的去追趕那一羣野鴨子。　　「現在剩着在河上的，就只有她們了。……船夫陰鬱地用慨嘆的聲調說着，這惹動了我們無限的威慨和慚愧，於是我們也都輕輕的嘆息起來了。　　風勢稍微轉變了，布帆就被鼓得臃腫了起來，接着我們底船也就加快着向前奔馳。當我們再回轉頭來看看時，那隻小舢板已經在蘆葦里隱沒了，在這地里，還聽得見獵槍聲頻頻的響着。神的威權（下）  瑞芝　　呵！夏日的原野，一切是美麗的。久住都市的人，到此就好似進入了仙境了。　　友人是地主之家，到了他家里，一切的生活，却好似我們故鄉的佃戶，完全沒有一點地主的家勢，雖然他家有了幾百區（區者卽海一格之稱）的山田，但海年的收成，却還是有限，友人告訴我　　「我們這里的地主，最富有的也就像我們這樣了。在從前，一年的兩次收成，最少也可賣他個千把石，除了捐稅，也就可以很富裕了。可是近五六年來，二年一次災，甚至一年二次災也有，捐稅又加重，災年仍要納稅，這樣雖富裕也就只好窮下來了，像這樣幾百區田，看起來數目倒不少，但收成起來，却比不上從前幾十區，你想，鄉下的生活，咱們怎麽能够過呢？都市里也許還可以混一點哩！　　友人說後就只嘆息，坐在旁邊的一個長工，却挿上來說；　　「少爺：你們在外可好哩！咱們鄉間再別提了。今年鬧了水災，明年再鬧阜災，加捐加稅，連皮都給剝個乾掙。遠算天老爺不把人都絕了，總算還能够活下來。幾年來都虧這里的關老爺，才不致像別處那麼厲害。過幾天又要拜神了，你們住多些時趕熱鬧吧！一年，就只有這一次呢！」　　聽了他倆的話，我心裏也有點不大舒適起來，述年來祗見人人在呌着到農村去，原來農村中却是這末一個情形，早就想回故鄉去享田圓之樂，悅親戚的情話的我，却像給倒下了一盆冷水，想想我的故鄉，恐怕也與這裏是差不了多少的了。　　不過鄉下人到底還是忠　，他們不</p>

<h3>Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong Fly from Guangdong to Yongzhou to Witness Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu Take Their Oaths of Office, Li Bai Host a Late-Night Banquet to Celebrate Peace, He Jian and Xiong Shihui Return Separately to Hunan and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong, along with a party of nine including secretaries and adjutants, flew to Yongzhou in a giant aircraft at 10:00 AM on the 13th, arriving around 12:30 PM. In addition to witnessing the oath-taking, Cheng will also discuss the reorganization of the Guangxi military and government. He is expected to return to Guangdong on the 17th or 18th, possibly accompanied by Bai. Ye Zhao will go to Zhongshun on the 13th to take over Chen Hanguang's 160th Division. Chen will return to the province on the 13th to meet with Yu. He Jian and Xiong Shihui paid respects to Chiang on the morning of the 13th and departed at 6:00 PM on special trains of the Guangdong Railway, returning separately to Hunan and Jiangxi. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Cheng Qian flew to Yongzhou in a giant Ford aircraft at 10:17 AM on the morning of the 13th to represent the National Government in witnessing the oath-taking of Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu. It is estimated that Cheng will arrive around noon. Those traveling to Guangxi by the same plane include Huang Shaoxiong and Liang Naixian, a reporter from the Central News Agency, along with six others. Yu Hanmou, Chen Cheng, Xu Jingtang, Chen Qingyun, Liu Jiwen, and dozens of military and government officials went to the airport to see them off. Cheng will return to Guangdong on the 16th after witnessing the oath-taking. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) A dispatch from Yongning states that Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong, accompanied by Lieutenant General Lei Biao of the Military Affairs Commission and Liang Naixian, a reporter from the Central News Agency, totaling six people, arrived in Yongzhou at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 13th. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang appoints Chen Cheng concurrently as Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, and Luo Zhuoying is promoted to Chief of Staff of the Third Route Army. Li Zongren is also appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army, commanding the Guangxi divisions. It is also internally decided that He Jian will be Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army, commanding the troops currently stationed in Hunan. Wei Lihuang will be Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route Army, commanding the Fujian divisions. Li Shusen is promoted to Commander of the 18th Army. Chen Cheng has already taken office in Guangdong. Li Zongren will take office on the 16th. He Jian and Wei Lihuang will assume their posts after returning to Hunan and Fujian within days. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The political circles remain optimistic about the Guangxi situation, believing that there will be no further obstacles in the final resolution process. It is currently expected that Li and Bai will assume their new positions in Nanning on Wednesday. It is reported that the final terms of the resolution will be brought here by Deng Shizeng. Deng was originally scheduled to return here from Nanning yesterday, but he did not arrive by the evening. Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong are expected to go to Nanning tomorrow to prepare for the military aftermath in Guangxi. He Jian may also accompany them. At the same time, the Beihai incident has shifted public attention from political events. The authorities are deeply concerned that the Japanese will make a mountain out of a molehill. Therefore, they have requested the Guangxi side to withdraw the 19th Route Army from Beihai to facilitate a thorough investigation into the death of the Japanese national Nakano. It is apparent that the presence of the 19th Route Army in that area has prevented the commissioner sent by Guangdong Province to investigate the case from making progress. As of last night, the Foreign Affairs Office had not yet received a detailed report on the case. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li, Bai, Cai, and others hosted a banquet on the evening of the 13th for Cheng and Huang to celebrate the successful conclusion of peace. Deng Shizeng will remain in Guangxi temporarily to coordinate the aftermath. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reducing the Number of Rickshaws</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Guild of the Shanghai Special District opposes the Municipal Council's movement to reduce the number of rickshaws. Recently, it has become increasingly active. Yesterday, all the rickshaw owners convened a general meeting at the Chamber of Commerce and passed five resolutions. At the same time, they issued an official statement, pointing out that "the Municipal Council authorities' proposal to reduce the number of public rickshaws is aimed at implementing the monopoly of the public buses it operates, thereby encroaching on the legitimate business of the Chinese. This is a matter of national competition and the livelihood of the poor, and we must fight for it on reasonable grounds."</p>
<p>This issue seems not so big at first glance, and the nature it contains seems not so serious. The center of its initiation seems to lie with the rickshaw owners. However, after careful analysis, it feels that this is a common problem in various cities in China, but it is particularly serious in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the impact of rural bankruptcy in China, the general farmers who have no food or clothing have had to go to the cities to seek a livelihood. At the same time, due to the decline of industry and commerce, a large number of unemployed workers in the city have had to find a way out. Under such circumstances, the most obvious social phenomenon is the surplus of rickshaw pullers. The continuous increase in rickshaws has led the owners to take the opportunity to raise rental prices, placing a heavy burden on the rickshaw pullers. However, in order to solicit business, the rickshaw pullers try to reduce the fare as much as possible for the customers, and even the fare of rickshaws is comparable to that of public buses. Such so-called "livelihood of the poor" is really pitiful.</p>
<p>Due to the increase in the number of rickshaws and the reduction in fares, the income of specialized public buses and trams is naturally directly affected. The concession authorities, for this reason, and also to "maintain the cleanliness of the city," and to cater to the psychology of a small number of upper-class Chinese, made the decision to reduce the number of rickshaws.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of rickshaws is originally not a reasonable move in the current economic situation, people's livelihood, and social organization. Because the use of transportation should be adapted to the local objective environment, and should not be aimed at monopolizing profits. Reducing the number of rickshaws will cause tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers to lose their jobs and promote social unrest. The superficial benefits in terms of city appearance are really not worth the actual disadvantages. From this point of view, we express sympathy for the Rickshaw Guild's reasonable fight.</p>
<p>However, when we observe from another aspect, we feel that this opposition movement of the rickshaw owners to reduce the number of rickshaws focuses too much on the interests of the owners themselves. If the owners are really for the "livelihood of the poor," they should consider the lives of the rickshaw pullers in many ways and integrate the interests of national competition and the livelihood of the poor. Otherwise, if the number of rickshaws is also reduced, the result will definitely be to raise the rental price and increase the burden on the rickshaw pullers. The fare for passengers, however, cannot be raised much due to the competition from public buses and trams. Even if the number of rickshaws is not reduced, the ones who will profit three times over are still the owners. There is no talk of improving the livelihood of the poor.</p>

<h3>Northern San Sebastian Falls, Major Victory for Western Rebel Army, Fierce Street Fighting, Garrison Forced to Retreat, Fires Break Out Everywhere in the City, Light Visible to the Heavens</h3>
<p>Andaye, Southern France: Spanish Nationalist troops entered the city of San Sebastian last night at midnight. Street fighting between the two sides was very fierce. At 2:00 AM this morning, anarchists threw bombs at most of the houses and set them on fire. (13th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Andaye: The rebel army on the northern front has once again achieved a major victory, as San Sebastian, a famous summer resort in northeastern Spain, was occupied by them last night. The first batch of rebel troops entered the city at midnight, and sporadic gunfire was heard in the streets. Around 2:00 AM this morning, a large rebel force slowly began to enter the city. The anarchists on the garrison side originally intended to destroy the entire city before leaving, so that the rebels would gain nothing after occupying it. However, the Basque Nationalists believed that this act of destroying a famous city was meaningless, so they tried to stop it. As a result, infighting broke out between the two sides. However, the anarchists finally set off many incendiary bombs when they withdrew, causing many houses to be burned, so that flames could be seen everywhere in the city. Until the rebel troops entered the city, there were still a few Basque Nationalists remaining in the city, engaged in extinguishing the fires everywhere. It is said that the last obstacle for the rebel troops to occupy San Sebastian was only overcome yesterday, because the rebel troops fiercely attacked the Hernani and Oyarzun areas, and occupied the strongholds of Santa Barbara, which controlled the government army and the people's front militia. At this point, the government army was forced to retreat, and the rebel planes began to bomb the suburbs of San Sebastian to prepare for the infantry to advance.</p>
<p>Colonel Ortega, the civil administrator of San Sebastian, calmly took care of the retreat of the 4,000 garrison troops after hearing the news of the government army's defeat. Mr. Watts stayed in the office until the last minute and was the last person to leave the city.</p>
<p>Although this fall of San Sebastian was not as bloody as the occupation of Irun, it cannot be denied that it was a major victory for General Mola, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army's northern front. The fall of San Sebastian was expected by most people, so they were not surprised by its occupation by the rebel troops.</p>
<p>San Sebastian is the most famous scenic spot in Spain. In peacetime, a large number of people from all over Europe come to visit, especially residents of Madrid who come here to spend their holidays. The city was rebuilt after being destroyed by the British during the Peninsular War. In addition to the well-equipped bathing resorts, there is also a large casino and a bullring. San Sebastian is the seat of a bishop, and the port has complete berthing facilities. In peacetime, the shipping industry is very developed. Also, the city used to be the capital of the province of Guipuzcoa, but the capital of the province has now been changed to Tolosa. San Sebastian suffered losses in all the French and Spanish wars, and was occupied by France three times in 1719, 1794, and 1808. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Andaye: The Spanish city of San Sebastian fell last night. A reporter from this agency reported the circumstances of the fall: The Nationalist troops took the lead at midnight last night with regular troops, first occupying several houses in the city, and then street fighting broke out. Gunfire in the streets was incessant. By 2:00 AM this morning, the Nationalist troops had gradually advanced. Suddenly, the Colzal district in the city center, the prosperous market town, and some houses around the city walls caught fire at the same time. Suddenly, the fire was so bright that it was impossible to approach. This was because the anarchists threw incendiary bombs all over the city to carry out intimidating measures. At this time, there were still some members of the Basque Nationalist Party standing on the streets, hoping to preserve the city and prevent it from being devastated, and attacked the anarchists. The Moroccan regular troops of the Nationalist troops seized the entire city at this time. (13th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>San Sebastian: Since the Spanish Nationalist troops captured Irun and other important nearby locations, the northern port of San Sebastian has been besieged. The Nationalist troops distributed leaflets by plane the day before yesterday, ordering the garrison in the city to surrender within 48 hours. The deadline expired this morning. Ortega, the governor of the province of Guipuzcoa, who defended the city, originally intended to resist, but recently decided to abandon San Sebastian because the enemy was pressing down on the city and the general situation was over. The government army is now starting to retreat in excellent order. (13th Havas</p>
<h3>Governor Ortega Decides to Abandon San Sebastian, Command Headquarters Moved to Sumaya, Preparing Defenses to Await Reinforcements and Launch a Counterattack</h3>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. Ortega, the Governor of Guipúzcoa province in Spain, recognizing the dire situation in San Sebastián, convened a meeting of various agency heads at the provincial council last night and immediately decided to abandon the city. The Governor moved to Sumaya early this morning, establishing the command headquarters and radio station there to continue the resistance. The military and transportation departments were established in Motrico and Deba, respectively, while the food station was set up in Eibar, where an armaments factory is working day and night. The health department was established in the rear at the port of Bilbao, and the Basque militia guarded the Azpeitia positions to provide flanking support. On the eve of his departure, Governor Ortega declared to our reporter, "The government forces on the province's front line have only ordered a small number of machine gun teams to be stationed in various locations, striving to resist and delay the advance of the rebel forces. We will seize this opportunity to establish strong defensive positions in the surrounding areas, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements from the rear. Then, in a week, we will launch a counterattack against the rebel forces." As of six o'clock this morning, the rebel forces had not yet completely occupied San Sebastián. The rebel forces were advancing slowly as a precaution, but there were few militia members left in the city, and their resistance was weak. Based on the current situation, it is only a matter of time before the entire city falls. Soon, the red and yellow flag of the monarchist nation will be flying above the provincial council building. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Forces Occupy Key Passes, Eliminating Obstacles to Advance: Latest News</h3>
<p>Hendaye. It is expected that the troops of General Mola of the Spanish rebel forces will be victorious and enter San Sebastián today. The 4,000 defenders of the city have retreated in disarray and gathered on the road from San Sebastián to Bilbao. Yesterday, the rebel forces began a fierce attack on the Hernani and Oiartzun areas and then occupied Santa Bárbara, a key pass controlling access to the locations held by the People's Front militia. Thus, the last obstacle to capturing San Sebastián was eliminated. The government forces were forced to retreat, and the rebel aircraft began bombing the outskirts of the town to prepare for the infantry's advance. After receiving news of the government forces' defeat, Civil Governor Ortega of San Sebastián gathered supporters of the People's Front in the city and transported them to Bilbao in trucks and freighters. Members of the Basque Nationalist Party also assisted, serving as police and striving to prevent anarchists from engaging in arson. Last night, Mr. Wodehouse was still working in his office and said that he and his colleagues would be the last to leave the city. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>San Sebastián. After Guipúzcoa Governor Ortega decided to abandon this city, our reporter has learned that the Governor ordered the government troops to destroy only the radio station and one tunnel before withdrawing. Government troops are now constructing fortifications in the port of Bilbao, where a battle is about to take place. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Bilbao in Food Crisis and Isolation</h3>
<p>Pamplona (currently in Nationalist hands). A sympathizer of the Nationalist forces who had escaped from the government-held city of Bilbao recently arrived here and stated to our reporter, "The city's food supply is dwindling, and the citizens are subsisting on rye bread. Coal and various fuels are exhausted, and the city is clearly in a state of isolation. The government forces have established three defense committees in the city, consisting of eleven sections each, organized by members of the People's Front and the Basque Nationalist Party, whose actions are extremely unified. The residents are divided into two groups: one is the People's Front militia and the Basque, who mostly perform internal security duties; the other is the security forces and the army personnel who refused to join the Nationalist forces, who are all transferred to the front lines for combat. The city authorities, in order to cope with huge expenses, have implemented compulsory contributions, with residents paying according to their circumstances. For a week, the Communist Party committee has been issuing bread and meat purchase certificates. Now, when they attempt to purchase on credit from merchants, they are rejected. At this moment, the tricolor flag of the Republic is no longer visible in the city, replaced by the Communist Party flag and the Basque flag." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Three Columns of Rebel Forces Preparing for a General Assault on Madrid</h3>
<p>Burgos. In the past few days, the rebel forces have occupied several new strategic locations and are now preparing to launch a major offensive on Madrid from three directions. The attack will begin as soon as the advancing columns are ready. The first column will launch its attack from the Guadalajara area, about forty miles east and slightly north of the capital. The second column will advance from the Guadarrama Mountains in the north. Since the outbreak of the civil war, the two sides have clashed repeatedly in this area, advancing and retreating alternately, and are still locked in a stalemate. The third column will attack from Maqueda, located twenty-five miles along the highway west of the road from Talavera to Madrid. A recent battle was fought in the area. With the intention of converging to attack the capital, they have now inflicted a major defeat on the government forces. It is said that the three columns include regular troops, foreign legionnaires, and volunteers. After hours of fierce hand-to-hand combat with bayonets and swords, they have surrounded the government forces in Maqueda and inflicted heavy casualties. It is said that a large number of reinforcements are rushing from Madrid to the area to consolidate the government forces' line of defense, but the rebel forces seem to have heavy artillery and ample ammunition, and also have aircraft to assist them. According to Seville radio, when the rebel forces launched an airstrike on Madrid, they hit a government army barracks, killing 250 militia members in the camp. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Vicinity of the Capital</h3>
<p>Burgos. Heavy fighting between government and Nationalist forces has been ongoing for the last 100 hours in the city of Talavera, 170 kilometers from the capital, and has not stopped. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Forces Deny Ceasefire Negotiations</h3>
<p>Burgos. According to foreign sources, an agreement between the Madrid government and the Nationalist forces may be established within days, stipulating a ceasefire of fifteen days. The Nationalist government here has firmly denied this. An official stated to our reporter, "This news is not only false but also malicious. Its purpose is to make people believe that the Nationalist forces can negotiate with the Madrid government. In reality, this decisive battle will not end until the Nationalist forces have won completely or the Madrid government has surrendered unconditionally." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Alcázar Castle Destroyed by Heavy Bombardment; Rebel Forces Still Tenaciously Resisting; Women and Children Held Hostage Refuse to Be Released</h3>
<p>Toledo. The rebel forces in the historically famous Alcázar Palace south of Madrid, have been besieged by government forces for a long time. The Alcázar Palace has been destroyed by artillery fire, leaving only ruins, but the rebel forces are still stubbornly resisting. A few days ago, the government forces asked the rebel forces to release the women and children in the palace, but the rebel forces refused, only requesting that a Catholic priest be allowed to enter the palace to perform Christian last rites for the deceased. The government forces granted the request and sent the famous Madrid priest Father Camella to the besieged palace. After arriving inside, Father Camella performed the sacrament of confession for those besieged and baptized two newborn babies in the besieged palace. At the same time, he also conveyed the government's intention, stating that the government forces would soon launch a final assault, and if the women and children in the palace were released before the final assault, the government forces would guarantee their safety. Those besieged replied that they would answer after deliberation. According to the leader of the government forces besieging the Alcázar Palace, Basilio, who recently spoke to the Havas reporter, "Father Camella repeatedly advised those besieged that releasing the women and children hostages in the besieged palace was a moral responsibility. The rebel forces agreed to respond between 7:00 and 7:30 p.m. The priest then left the palace. At 7:30 p.m., the government forces' sentries asked the rebel forces for a response. The rebel forces replied that after consideration, they had decided to refuse to release the women and children hostages, so negotiations were terminated. Therefore, we must declare to the world that the responsibility for the killing of innocent women and children lies with the rebel forces, not the government. In short, the government is now prepared, and this issue will be resolved soon. According to general impressions, the rebel leaders probably did not inform the besieged military and civilians of the government's intentions, nor did they hold a meeting, but only a few rebel leaders made the decision on their own." In addition, the Havas reporter also spoke with Father Camella, who described the horrific scenes inside the besieged city, which were unbearable to witness. "Those besieged were all in ragged clothes, some completely naked, with only a bullet belt tied around their waists. Some people rushed forward and hugged me, begging me to find a way to get them out of this living hell as soon as possible." The priest could not finish speaking, choking with sobs, overcome with compassion. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

It is also heard that the cabinet ministers have decided to petition President Azaña to grant a pardon to Manques, who was sentenced to death by the Almería People's Court. Manques originally belonged to the right wing and was sentenced to death for participating in the rebellion, but his son joined the militia belonging to the People's Front and fought against the rebel forces. Therefore, he requested a pardon for his father's death sentence. In addition, the cabinet also decided that the capital's stock exchange will remain closed until October 15th.

<h3>Portuguese Embassy Moves Out of the Spanish Capital</h3>
<p>Madrid. The Portuguese embassy has moved from here to the city of Alicante in the southeast. Semi-official sources in Lisbon declared yesterday that the militia belonging to the Spanish government had previously broken into the Portuguese embassy, demanding that Chargé d'Affaires Viscount de Tamija hand over diplomatic documents, saying that otherwise, they would set it on fire. Interior Minister Caracue denied this, saying, "Chargé d'Affaires Tamija left Madrid a few days ago, but the reason why is unknown." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Approaching; Ousting Argentine Representative from the Meeting; As a Condition for Italy's Participation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Before the opening of each annual session of the League of Nations General Assembly, a meeting of the Executive Council must be convened. This year's annual session has been scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. Therefore, the Executive Council will also convene a meeting on the 18th of this month as usual, which will be chaired by Chilean representative Rivas. Rivas arrived here today. It is heard that Italy does not intend to send a representative to the Executive Council meeting. Whether Italy participates in the work of the League of Nations depends on the decision of the Credentials Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly regarding the credentials of the Abyssinian representative. It is generally expected that if the committee deems the Abyssinian representative unqualified, and Italy also believes that this is tantamount to excluding Abyssinia from the League of Nations, then Italy may reconsider its participation. (According to recent rumors, the Italian government has now drafted a plan to exclude the Abyssinian representative through the League of Nations General Assembly Credentials Committee. The method is for the committee to examine the representative's credentials, including who issued them. If they were issued by the Abyssinian emperor, then since he has no such authority after his exile; if they were issued by the new government established in the Gojjam region of the country, then since the new government has not been recognized by the League of Nations, its dispatched representative cannot be allowed to attend the meeting.)

<h3>Italy Reorganizing Military to Modernize Armaments</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to authorities, Prime Minister Mussolini, while announcing the intensification of military preparations in a speech to the cabinet yesterday, declared that Italy's military strength will continue to decrease in the future. As for the reorganization of the military, the emphasis is on mechanizing and modernizing armaments, and will not go beyond this scope. During the Italian-Abyssinian War, a total of 1.2 million Italians took up arms. Currently, the Italian army has fewer than 500,000 men. It is learned that Italy will maintain a military force of 64,300 men in Abyssinia to maintain peace, not the originally rumored 150,000. Of these, 24,300 are Italian soldiers, and the remaining 40,000 are Eritrean soldiers. The Italian forces include one Italian army division, nine Blackshirt militia battalions, and some grenade troops. They will be composed of 2,000 career officers, 500 short-term officers, 1,800 non-commissioned officers, and 20,000 other ranks. Considering the area of Abyssinia, this number is small, but they can be mobilized quickly and are highly mechanized, so they are sufficient. It is currently estimated that 150,000 Italian laborers will be needed to carry out the construction of roads and other public works in Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Abyssinia Divided into Five Administrative Regions; Each Region Led by a Governor Under the Control of the Viceroy</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Council of State yesterday passed an order stipulating that the administrative organization of Abyssinia should be based on the three principles of "order, authority, and hierarchy" advocated by the Italian Fascist Party. The entire territory of Abyssinia is divided into five administrative regions, each with a governor, all under the control of the viceroy. Under the governor, there are several commissioners, each in charge of several districts. Each district is stationed with an Italian commissioner, who is responsible for political and police affairs. Local chiefs are directly under the jurisdiction of the local Italian commissioner and act as a liaison between the Italian authorities and the local population, but may not exercise power independently. Regarding the judicial organization, Italians and Caucasians are subject to Italian law, but indigenous cases should be handled by special courts and should not be mixed. In addition, all customs and habits of Abyssinia that do not conflict with the principles of the Fascist Party should be respected. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Emperor Purchases Villa in England</h3>
<p>Bath, England. The Abyssinian Emperor recently purchased a villa here and visited it yesterday. He stated to reporters, "I recently stayed here for a short time and was very impressed.

<h3>Little Entente Political Conference Opens; Future Diplomatic Inclinations Worth Watching</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Standing Political Council of the Little Entente countries opened today in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. Military and political figures here are paying close attention to this conference, especially the influence that Romania may exert on this conference, which is enough to arouse some hopes among military and political figures here. These people hope that the current policy evolution of the Little Entente countries may tend towards the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian group, and even cooperation with Germany is possible. The dismissal of former Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu is greatly satisfying to people here and is not concealed in the slightest. Taking Romania's oil production as an example, Italy had originally stopped purchasing it, but upon hearing of Titulescu's dismissal, it immediately resumed ordering it. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries is scheduled to open today. The Director of Information of the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, Hájek, hosted a banquet for reporters last night and explained the country's foreign policy, stating, "In addition to signing a treaty of alliance with France last May, our country also concluded a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union in July of the same year. At that time, the general opinion was that Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union did this to safeguard peace and security in Central Europe. It was not until the last two months that it was criticized, saying that this was a sinister method of Bolshevism and a tool for attacking other countries in the future. This statement is not accurate. After Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union concluded an agreement, if they are not attacked by another country for a day, they will not invoke the agreement for a day, and will not allow a single soldier from a foreign country to enter Central Europe." Hájek then spoke about the issue of the German minority in Czechoslovakia, stating, "What the German minority seeks is to participate in political power, not to strive for independence. The current policy of our government does not need to be changed." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Prague. Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović, Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, and Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Krofta spent most of the day today at President Beneš's summer villa in Bolatice.

<h3>British Air Minister Discusses the International Situation; Only Britain Can Save the Situation; Collective and Regional Security Should Not Be Neglected</h3>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party held a banquet in Carlisle, Cumberland today, where Air Minister Swinton gave a speech analyzing the general international situation, stating, "The international situation is becoming increasingly gloomy. Today, scientific inventions are sufficient to change the climate and stop wind and rain, but the human world is still dark and stormy, and the situation cannot be reversed. This is all caused by suspicion and fear... The best internationalism is to make everyone love their motherland. Our Britain is the pillar in the middle of the stream. In this storm, broken ships rely on Britain to be maintained. If the British Empire encounters misfortune, the whole world will have no hope of being intact. For this reason, the British government must do everything possible, regardless of everything, to ensure the security of Britain." Swinton went on to advocate that collective security and regional security should not be neglected, saying, "Regional security pacts are sufficient to protect and recognize the rights of participating countries. In view of this, the British government is preparing to begin negotiations with Western European countries to promote a new Locarno Pact." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>The Extreme Faction of the British Conservative Party Rejects the Old Guard; Dissatisfied with Prime Minister Baldwin; MacDonald Is Also Uneasy in His Position</h3>
<p>(London) According to "The Star," the extreme faction of the Conservative Party is now preparing to launch a fierce attack on Prime Minister Baldwin. Therefore, Prime Minister Baldwin intends to resign before King Edward VIII's coronation ceremony in May of next year. The British House of Commons may also hold elections before May of next year. It is heard that the Conservative Party's election officials have received orders from the cadres to begin preparing for the election campaign. The Star also said that the extreme faction of the Conservative Party also wants to force Lord President MacDonald to resign because MacDonald is sufficient to hinder the development of Britain's military expansion policy. It is heard that the extreme faction of the Conservative Party has a slogan of clearing out all "old guards" within the party. The method they use is to follow the old method, that is, to convene the so-called "Carlton Club meeting" (the Carlton Club is a cadre organization of the Conservative Party) and exert "pressure" on the party leader.

<h3>Speech to the Labor Front: Hitler Again Denigrates the Soviet Union; Territorial Ambitions Increasingly Apparent; Encourages Soldiers to Fight Against Communism</h3>
<p>Nuremberg - The National Socialist Party's annual convention held a "Labor Front" meeting today. Führer Hitler delivered a speech, continuing his attacks on the Soviet Union, stating, "We have always known only construction and have never destroyed a single thing. Conversely, Bolshevik Russia knows only destruction and not construction. How can those Bolshevik Jewish partisans possess such vast lands, while we Germans have no opportunity to enjoy a happy life? If we possessed the plains of Siberia and the wheat fields of Ukraine, we would all become wealthy. Under National Socialist rule, these lands would be transformed into a paradise on earth. However, because our territory is too small, we can only struggle arduously to secure a full meal. What could be more unjust than this? The Russians often boast about their underground railways, claiming they are the best in the world. Know that we have built 7,000 kilometers of highways, while the Russians have built only seven kilometers of underground railways," and so on. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg - Today, as Hitler traveled by car to the National Socialist Party convention to address the Labor Front, 400 of Germany's newest fighter planes and bombers soared over the center of Nuremberg. Hitler's delight was like that of a schoolboy. Tens of thousands of people cheered Hitler and the planes. The planes will participate in a major display of German air power on Monday. Hitler said to the Labor Front, "My first creed is never to destroy anything, but only to create. This is exactly the opposite of what Soviet Russia does. Germany is not like the Bolshevik Jews, who are in the superior position of possessing rich lands. If Germany had the Ural, Siberian, and Ukrainian wheat-producing lands, it would be leisurely and free, without having to struggle to survive." Hitler continued, discussing the Four-Year Plan, saying that after four years, Germany's required raw materials would all be produced by its chemists, mines, and factories, without relying on other countries at all. He concluded, "Nothing is impossible. The Labor Front has now shown that it has one common aspiration, one resolution, and one success." Following this, Labor Front leader Dr. Ley announced a plan to build five million homes for laborers, saying, "We cannot allow the people to live in slums again." Ley also advised laborers to understand that wages are not their only reward. In addition, there are rest days, working conditions, and various benefits provided by the state, such as education, culture, and regaining strength through entertainment and sports, and so on.

<h3>Luitpoldhain Square: Grand Review of German Party Troops; Hitler Conducts Flag-Presenting Ceremony</h3>
<p>Nuremberg - With the National Socialist Party congress underway, the party troops held a grand review today. A total of 80,000 Stormtroopers, 20,000 Security Squads, and 5,000 motorized troops gathered at the center of Luitpoldhain Square and marched in formation before Führer Hitler. The Führer then delivered a speech (text in separate dispatch) and presented flags to the above units. Regarding the future of the party troops, there have been varying rumors recently, some saying they would be disbanded immediately, others saying they would be incorporated into the regular army. Now that Führer Hitler has presented flags, it is clear that these party troops will be retained. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg - Führer Hitler recently delivered a speech at Luitpoldhain Square to the Stormtroopers, Security Squads, and motorized troops, stating, "Our age-old enemies, whom we have defeated, now intend to engage in agitation within our borders and threaten us with clenched fists. Let them know that our country is fully prepared and ready to cope at any time. I hope others do not misjudge themselves. Foreign authorities often instigate the masses, entice the masses, and hold demonstrations against National Socialism and Fascism, advocating for Bolshevism and providing them with arms and money. As for myself, I have never led Germany in any demonstration, except for one special movement (thunderous applause from the audience). At that time, Germany will never see one or two thousand undisciplined people gathered in one place; what will be seen is millions of people rising up together to contend with the age-old enemies of humanity. I dare to reiterate the words of the veterans: We are willing to cooperate with other countries and have no grievances against others, but Germany will never become a follower of Bolshevism," and so on. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg - The National Socialist Party's review of troops consisted of the Labor Service Corps, the National Socialist Youth, political leaders, brown and black party troops, and motorized units marching in formation before Führer Hitler. These units are all used for internal affairs. Now that the review is complete, it is evident that the New Germany's internal strength is indeed capable of coping with any eventuality. Tomorrow, an army review will be held to show that Germany is prepared for all external threats and has nothing to fear. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Russian Minister of Land Affairs Encourages the Red Army to Fully Defend the Country; Unprecedented Military Exercises on Land and Air; Observer Groups Greatly Appreciate</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov, today in Minsk, delivered a speech to the troops participating in this major exercise, saying, "The invincible Red Army is prepared to annihilate the enemy within its own territory at any time." Observer groups from Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia paid close attention to the grand formations of infantry, cavalry, artillery, and tank units, as well as the aircraft circling in the sky. A Cossack unit was particularly praised by the audience. After the march in formation, General Uborevich, the district commander, hosted a banquet to entertain the observer groups from various countries. Uborevich said in his speech that the Red Army is an army of peace and national defense. Although certain countries are currently working on weapons and there is a threat of inciting a second world war, fortunately, the majority of countries are now engaged in various methods to prevent the outbreak of conflict. The countries that have sent representatives to observe the exercise are all upholding a policy of peace, and Soviet Russia will also contribute as much as possible to support this policy. Uborevich also said, "We do not want war, but when forced to fight, we possess a powerful army to protect ourselves and peace." General Wavell, the leader of the British observer group, rose to reply, hoping that the Soviet Russian army would soon send a delegation to Britain. General Chavescot, the leader of the French observer group, and General Rucha, the Czech representative, greatly admired the efficiency of the Soviet Russian Red Army, praising the air force and tank units in particular. General Chavescot of France solemnly declared that the only purpose of cooperation between France and Russia is peace, and so on. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Plans to Replenish Armaments; Aims to Complete All Within Twelve Years; First Half Budget of 3 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army is scheduled to submit the Army's budget estimate for the next fiscal year to the Ministry of Finance on the 15th or 16th. According to the Army's new national defense preparation plan, it is a twelve-year plan, with the main part to be realized in the first six years, i.e., Showa 12 (1937). Due to the need to prepare for the implementation plan, the required budget and basic budget total 820 million yen. From Showa 13 (1938) to 17 (1942), an additional 100 million yen will be added each year. In the second half, from Showa 18 (1943) onwards, the second phase of the plan will be implemented. The purpose of the new national defense preparation plan is to maintain equal military power with countries in the Far East, in order to avoid the crisis of war. The important armament replenishment is to expand air force strength and improve army equipment. Because the Army authorities have such a plan, when requesting a budget of 820 million yen for the next fiscal year, they are also requesting the Ministry of Finance to approve a budget of more than 3 billion yen over six years, in order to establish the national defense plan. (Domei News Agency, 13th)</p>

<h3>Great Leap in Construction in Backward Regions of the Soviet Union; Zealous Reclamation of Barren Land Transforms into Fertile Fields; Hardworking Spirit is Exemplary</h3>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency Special Dispatch, 13th - Since the success of the revolution, in addition to focusing all efforts on reforming the political and economic institutions of European Russia, the Soviet Union has also paid great attention to the construction of backward regions in the Far East. Now, the northeastern region and the wilderness of Far Eastern Siberia have become a glorious and increasingly prosperous area. Its future is worthy of our attention, and its spirit of hard work and zealous reclamation can be emulated. Here is a brief description. Although the perspective of one person cannot see the whole picture, it can serve as an aid to those who care about the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Conquering the Arctic Ocean - Since 1920, the Soviet authorities have transported timber from the Enisei River basin of the Siberian River and grain from Siberia by a total of ten steamships, sailing down the two rivers, through the Kara Sea of the Arctic Ocean and entering Arkhangelsk. After that, they actively carried out exploration and navigation in the Arctic Ocean. For example, in 1932, the icebreaker "Sibiryakov" crossed the Arctic Ocean from east to west, which was the initial step of success. After the successful voyage of the "Sibiryakov," the Soviet authorities established the Northern Sea Route Administration, increased the number of exploration teams, and added observation posts to intensify the work. In 1933, they also sent the "Chelyuskin" from Leningrad via Murmansk to break through the Arctic Ocean. The important purpose of the Soviet authorities' Arctic Ocean navigation work is to test the icebreaker's readiness for Arctic Ocean navigation to operate ordinary merchant ships. Therefore, since 1935, more than 70 steamships have been sailing in the Arctic Ocean, all arriving safely at their destinations. For the sake of safety in Arctic Ocean navigation, the Soviet authorities have specially set up four icebreakers, "Krasin," "Ermak," "Litke," and "Lenin," for regional prevention, and have established dozens of observation posts and countless aircraft along the coast to prevent accidents. In the same year, the Northern Sea Route Administration sent the icebreaker "Sadko" to carry out high-latitude exploration in the northwest Arctic Ocean. The ship has now decided to move eastward from last year's exploration site to complete the task. The content of the Soviet authorities' 1936 plan for Arctic Ocean navigation is as follows: The number of steamships participating in the Arctic Ocean cross-transportation plan will be increased to eight, six of which will sail from Leningrad to the Ob River, and two will sail in the opposite direction. Another four icebreakers will be used as guide ships. The icebreakers "Sedov," "Malygin," and "Sibiryakov" will be used for ocean surveys, and "Ruslanov" will be used for observation. The number of cargo ships transporting goods will be increased to more than 25. Once the plan is successful, it will make a great contribution to the Soviet Union's politics, military, and economy, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Kara Sea Navigation - The Kara Sea navigation route runs from Europe through the Ob River and the Yenisei River into the Kara Sea, and is the main route for exporting products from Siberia. Navigation began in the 16th and 17th centuries. After the establishment of the Soviet regime, scheduled sailings were established, exporting grain, timber, and other products from Siberia to various countries around the world. At the same time, agricultural tools and other processed products are transported from Europe to Siberia, which is of great economic significance. From 1921 to 1935, the amount of cargo transported each year increased sharply. For example, in 1921, only five ships entered and left, but by 1935, it had increased to 38 ships.</p>
<p>Building New Cities - Igarka is a new city along the Yenisei River, located seven kilometers from the mouth of the Yenisei River. It was built by the authorities in 1929. The city's population was only 105 in 1930, but it increased to 12,000 in 1935. In the summer of the same year, it can increase to 16,000. As for the number of ships coming and going, there were 35 in 1935. Currently, there are sawmills, fur trading houses, reindeer pastures, and other various enterprises, schools, hospitals, nurseries, cinemas, clubs, and newspapers.</p>
<p>Developing Natural Resources - Commercial ships began entering and leaving the Lela River in 1933, with a total of three in that year, four in the following year, and five in 1935. The Karuim River controls the lifeline of Chigart, the northeastern tip of Asia. The area has abundant natural resources and rich fisheries. The Soviet authorities plan to build a hydroelectric power plant on the Sretnyikan tributary of the river. Last summer, a group of technicians was sent to survey the area, and construction will begin soon. It is scheduled to be completed in 1940. As for the Tundara region along the Arctic Ocean, which is called the northern region in the Soviet Union, it is a virgin forest area, larger in area than continental Europe, with a population of only 900,000, of which more than 100,000 are primitive aborigines who rely on herding reindeer for a living. The Soviet authorities are also planning to transform them to develop evenly with other backward areas.</p>
<h3>Northern France Textile Industry Continues Factory Occupation Strike; Prime Minister Blum Personally Mediates</h3>
<p>Lille, France - 40,000 textile workers in Lille, who had been occupying factories, decided today to reoccupy the factories they had evacuated last night, because the employers refused to accept the arbitration of Interior Minister Salengro. Prime Minister Blum, at the request of Salengro, is now coming here overnight to mediate. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Petit Journal reports that the citizens of Lille have had a good impression after hearing that the Prime Minister will be visiting the city. "Furthermore, the Prime Minister invited representatives from both the Unified General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Association to hold a meeting in the capital tomorrow afternoon to discuss the issue of trade unions representing workers and employers signing contracts, as well as the implementation of the 40-hour work week. If the Lille labor unrest can be brought to an end, it would be a good omen." Le Nouveau Siècle reported, "Wages have already increased, it is true, but in the eyes of the workers in the North, the amount of the wage increase is far less than the rise in the cost of living. In short, the rise in prices and the increase in wages have presented a mutually chasing trend, and the situation is already extremely worrying. Although Interior Minister Salengro has been aware of this, the labor unrest still cannot be resolved after earnest efforts, because in order to resolve the labor unrest, the mutually chasing situation between wages and prices must first be curbed." Léon Jouhaux, Secretary-General of the Unified General Confederation of Labor, also published an article in L'Humanité, stating, "Labor unrest in various places, where it is purely professional in nature, is described by outsiders as political activity. The metallurgical workers once held a demonstration to express sympathy for their Spanish comrades, even though it only lasted for one hour, but outsiders used it as an excuse to say that the source of all movements should be sought in this."

<h3>U.S. Republican Candidate Begins Vigorous Campaign; Criticizes Roosevelt's New Deal</h3>
<p>Portland, Maine - Republican presidential candidate Landon today made his second incursion into the eastern states, campaigning for the election, giving a speech here, and urging the American people, regardless of their political beliefs, to oppose the New Deal as firmly as Maine, because "government control of agriculture and industry is a tendency for the world to move away from democracy, and the result can only lead to war, so if the world wants to avoid disaster, it must immediately stop this tendency." In Landon's speech today, there were three points that were directed directly at President Roosevelt. Observers believe that his purpose is to unite the various factions of the Republican Party in Maine, so that they can compete with the Democratic Party in the election on Tuesday. The election in Maine is earlier than in other states, and it is enough to predict the results of the general election in mid-November. As for the three points mentioned by Landon, the first is that President Roosevelt's government is still dominated by the spirit of the National Recovery Act, wanting to overthrow private enterprise and replace it with government control, and wanting to replace constitutional government with arbitrary personal power; the second is to ask the President to clearly announce whether he admits that the government's plan to control agriculture and commerce by government order is a mistake; the third is to criticize the President for abandoning the United States at the London Economic Conference in 1933, causing the United States to lose a great opportunity to promote world peace and economic security.

<h3>Former Director of Guangdong Agriculture and Forestry Bureau Feng Rui Executed: Crimes Include Embezzlement and Malfeasance in the Establishment of Sugar Factories; Sugar Monopoly Especially Resented by Guangdong Sugar Merchants</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: During Chen Jitang's rule in Guangdong, Feng Rui, the Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, planned and established sugar factories, implemented a province-wide sugar monopoly, and initiated a trend of officials competing with the people for profit, which was resented by merchants and the public. After the change of regime in Guangdong, Feng still hoped to be active in politics, leading to his detention by the authorities and imprisonment at the Gendarmerie Headquarters. The authorities then reported Feng's past wrongdoings. As a result, landowners who had their land requisitioned by the sugar factories, as well as merchants who opposed the sugar monopoly, filed charges against Feng's crimes. After several interrogations by the Gendarmerie Headquarters, it was determined that Feng's crimes were confirmed. The case was submitted to General Commander Yu Hanmou of the Fourth Route Army and Governor Huang Musong of the Provincial Government, and then forwarded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission for review. On the 3rd of the month, Chairman Chiang approved the death sentence. The military and civilian authorities then ordered the Gendarmerie Headquarters to carry out the execution. The Headquarters, upon receiving the order, brought the prisoner out for execution at 4:00 PM on the 9th. An enforcer from the Military Law Office of the Fourth Route Army was dispatched to record Feng's statement. When Feng was brought to court, he knew his death was imminent and his face turned pale. After the enforcer read the order to execute Feng, he asked Feng if he had any last words. Feng said in a trembling voice, "I have no last words, nor do I want to say anything. I only hope to see my old mother one last time." The enforcer said, "Due to the time constraints of the execution order, it cannot be done. If you have any last words, I can relay them on your behalf." Feng did not say another word, his mind seemingly in a daze. After a while, he began to say, "Please allow me to have a full meal of wine and meat before execution." The enforcer, considering this would delay the time, did not allow it. The prison officer from the Gendarmerie Headquarters removed Feng's handcuffs, tied him with hemp ropes, and escorted him onto a prison truck. Two gendarmes guarded him, and a row of gendarmes accompanied the enforcer in another vehicle. They proceeded to the execution ground at Chougang outside the East Suburb, where the execution was carried out. A joint public notice was issued by the Fourth Route Army and the Provincial Government, announcing Feng's crimes. The notice stated, "Regarding the matter of joint public notice, it has been found that Feng Rui, the former Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of Guangdong Province, has been accused of corruption, embezzlement, and numerous evil deeds. After investigation and confirmation, the official abused his position as Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and concurrently managed the sugar industry, using public office for private gain and competing with the people for profit. He embezzled public funds. In addition, in purchasing machinery for sugar factories, buying foreign sugar from foreign merchants, requisitioning land from the people to plant sugarcane, lending money to farmers to plant sugarcane, and harvesting and transporting sugarcane on behalf of farmers, he engaged in embezzlement at every step. Farmers in various villages even had the saying 'Old Master Sugarcane,' all wanting to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. He is truly guilty of heinous crimes. It has now been reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government for approval of the death sentence and deprivation of public rights for life, in order to serve as a warning." It should be carried out accordingly. In addition to bringing the official Feng Rui to court for verification of identity and execution by firing squad, this public notice is hereby issued to all subordinates for their information."</p>
<p>Feng Rui was 38 years old, a native of Panyu. After his death, his body was claimed by his mother, Feng Ling, and his concubine, He Lili (a dancer and actress), for coffin burial at the Yueguang Funeral Company in Guangzhou. According to Feng's mother, who is over 80 years old, he was her only son. Feng's first wife had two daughters, who are over ten years old. The relationship between the couple was not very harmonious, and the first wife had returned with her two daughters to her mother's home in Beiping some years ago. Three years ago, Feng took He, a dancer, as his concubine for 5,000 gold coins. She has no children yet. Furthermore, Feng had studied in the United States and obtained a doctorate in agriculture. After returning to China, he served as a faculty member at Southeast University and as a technician in various agencies. When he returned to Guangdong, he served as a technician in the Construction Department, offering many opinions on agricultural and forestry affairs. He was subsequently appointed as the Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau under the Construction Department. Later, he was relied upon by Chen Jitang for establishing sugar factories. Afterwards, his proposal for a sugar monopoly benefited private individuals but aroused resentment against the government. After the political changes, Feng lingered and did not leave, leading to his arrest and severe punishment by the authorities. (September 11th)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Level Drops, Current Swift: Danger at Dongzhuang Closure Project; Sudden Collapse of West Zheng Dam by Hundreds of Feet; Thousands of Laborers Vigorously Working on Rescue</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Yellow River in Shandong Province breached its banks at Shaanxi and flooded eastward into the sea, the embankment conditions along the river have not encountered major dangers. It was hoped that the river could be safely contained, but although the water level has dropped, the current remains swift, and its direction is constantly shifting. The embankment maintenance along the river is extremely strenuous. Today (12th), a sudden and major danger occurred at the Dongzhuang Closure Project, which is the reason for this. According to the upstream Section Chief Bian Chongxiu, as he reported to the River Affairs Bureau repeatedly today (12th), the West Zheng Dam at the Dongzhuang closure site has collapsed severely. He has been supervising the laborers and soldiers to desperately protect it, and it was temporarily stabilized at one point. Now the upstream water level is rising again, and the embankment situation is tight. By the afternoon, the dam collapsed again and again, reaching hundreds of feet. In addition to jointly supervising the defense with Liu Bingzhong, the director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission's river defense team, he requested the River Affairs Bureau to urgently urge the magistrate of Puyang County to quickly mobilize laborers to assist in the rescue. The Director of the River Affairs Bureau, Wang Kairu, was inspecting the river defense along the river today (12th) and has arrived downstream at Dama Village. Upon receiving the report, he immediately telegraphed Puyang County to immediately mobilize laborers for rescue, and sent Zhao Youzeng, the Chief of the Accounting and Statistics Section of the River Bureau, to Dongzhuang to assist Bian Chongxiu in the defense, and to jointly discuss rescue measures with Liu Bingzhong. He also telegraphed the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, and the Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Kong Xiangrong, who went to Qingdao yesterday (11th), to report the embankment situation. Currently, there are thousands of laborers working at Dongzhuang. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has also dispatched ships from Lanfeng to transport stone materials for use, which have already arrived. Furthermore, the entire second team of the engineering team from Zhukou has been transferred to Dongzhuang for desperate rescue. It is believed that with a large number of personnel and materials available, the danger can be averted and no accidents will occur. Wang Kairu is scheduled to return west from downstream tomorrow (13th), and may not stop in Jinan but will proceed directly to Dongzhuang to supervise the embankment rescue.</p>
<h3>Banditry in Zhangzhou, Fujian, Escalates: Zhang Dingcheng Captures Nan Jing Ban Liao; Brutal Burning and Killing; Pacification Headquarters Mobilizes Troops for Another Large-Scale Suppression</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since July, the communists in western Fujian and Zhangzhou have been extremely rampant, especially in Nianjing, Pinghe, Zhangpu, Yunxiao, and Zhaoan under Zhangzhou’s administration. The Zhang-Long Road and Long-Zhao Road are regarded as dangerous routes for travelers. In early August, the 75th Division defeated Zhang Changshui's forces in Zhangpu, and for a time, the banditry in Zhangpu subsided slightly. At that time, it was reported that Zhang Changshui was shot through the chest in the battle of Niao Mountain on August 9th and died of his injuries on the 10th. This has now been proven untrue. Zhang led over a hundred bandits and raided the Xiawei Village militia in the Second District of Zhangpu on September 10th. The militia resisted for two hours. Fortunately, the Zhangpu garrison rushed to their aid, and the bandits fled back to Liangshan. The most recent serious bandit attacks are: (2) over two hundred communists led by Wu Jin attacked Yunxiao County on September 3rd, and were repelled by the citizens and residents of the villages near the city. This has been reported previously. (1) The communist leader Zhang Dingcheng of western Fujian captured Ban Liao Town in Nanjing in late August, and the looting and killing were brutal. Due to the remote location, the details have only recently been learned. According to the Lianbao Director of the Tasha Lianbao in the Third District of Nanjing, on behalf of 13,000 people from the Lianbao, telegrams were sent to the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government, stating: "This Lianbao has repeatedly been raided by Zhang Dingcheng, Li Tianhui, Li Chibiao, and Deng Zihui of Yongding communists, who collude with Chen Guangtan and Wang Hongmao of Pinghe Red Bandits. The people are living in misery. In mid-August, over a thousand Red Bandits gathered and besieged Ban Liao Township. The militia desperately defended the earthen fort while waiting for reinforcements. However, the bandits were numerous and the numbers were disparate. After besieging for six days, they finally ran out of ammunition and reinforcements, and had no choice but to risk their lives and break out at night, retreating to Tasha. The township was thus lost. In this battle, seven large earthen forts and over eight hundred civilian houses were burned down. Dozens of militiamen and civilians were killed, and countless were injured. Over ten people were captured and have not returned. Property was looted, and the losses exceed 200,000 yuan. The people are displaced. Fortunately, Commander Pan of the 15th Regiment of the 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division stationed in Yongding dispatched troops to help, although they were too late to save the town. The bandits have temporarily retreated to the Xiaoliancheng area, but they raid from time to time, and the people are suffering greatly. Please quickly send troops to suppress them and find ways to provide relief." Furthermore, a report stated, "In this battle, over two hundred bandits came to attack first, and captured an earthen fort and a mansion on the 23rd. On the 24th, Zhang Dingcheng and Li Chibiao's bandits, over two hundred in number, came to reinforce and captured three more mansions. By the 25th, all the earthen forts in the township were captured. The most tragic was the Yuchang Mansion, which held over three hundred male and female civilians, thirteen shotguns, and three rifles and pistols. It was besieged by bandits for three days and nights, eighty-four hours, and over twenty bandits were killed. On the morning of the 25th, the bandits used explosives to blow up the fort wall and captured it. Nine militiamen, including Hua Maosheng, were killed, and over eighty men, women, and children were captured. After the Yuchang Mansion fell, the entire township was under the control of the bandits, who set fire to everything and looted everywhere. The losses were unprecedented. On the 26th, Commander Pan of the 3rd Division dispatched troops, but the bandits had already retreated after looting and gathered in Tongpi with over 1,500 people, a grand and powerful force, unseen in recent years. And the over three hundred bandits in the Luxi area of Nanjing are not included." Furthermore, reports of bandits looting cars along the Zhang-Long Road are frequently heard. On the 26th of last month, over two hundred bandits intercepted the passenger car of Wu Dengren, the Deputy Commander of the Sixth Administrative District Security Division. One guard was killed, and one passenger died. The most serious incidents occurred on the 4th and 5th of this month, when three passenger cars were looted in a row. The Independent 37th Brigade, which is currently protecting the road, has announced that passenger and freight cars on the Zhang-Long Road are restricted to travel between 7:00 AM and 3:00 PM each morning. The brigade will dispatch troops to escort them. Outside of these hours, travel is prohibited to prevent further looting incidents. (Note: The Zhang-Long Road runs from Zhangzhou to Longyan and is the main road connecting Zhangzhou to western Fujian.) Due to the rampant banditry in western Fujian and Zhangzhou, the Pacification Headquarters has specially mobilized troops for a large-scale suppression, and it is hoped that a complete elimination of the bandits will not be difficult.

<h3>Northwest Animal Husbandry Farm: Recent Work Progressing According to Established Plans</h3>
<p>Lanzhou News: The Northwest Animal Husbandry Improvement Farm, originally organized by the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Commission, has been renamed the Northwest Animal Husbandry Farm of the Ministry of Industry after being placed under its jurisdiction. The main farm is still located at Ganping Temple, and the branch farm is still located at Songshan. The director of the farm is still粟显苜. In order to understand the future work plan of the farm, the reporter visited Director Su and inquired about everything. He informed me that after the farm was taken over by the Ministry of Industry, all the matters to be carried out will still be carried out according to the established plan. All the unfinished work that the Economic Commission planned to carry out in the 24th year, such as the establishment of a dairy laboratory, is still continuing. A new site has been found near Miaotanzi in Hebei, Lanzhou, and is being built. It will be completed soon. Most of the machinery used in the laboratory has been transported to Lanzhou and will be installed after the new site is completed. Experiments will be carried out to produce milk and refine butter. If the results are good, it will be sold on the market immediately. The matters to be carried out in the 25th year will also be carried out as before, such as the planting of Zhuosu, which is being actively carried out. Currently, over a hundred acres have been planted in Bajiucheng, Xiahe, and over five hundred acres in the Tutou Tan of Songshan. Dozens of acres have also been planted in Miaotanzi, Hebei, Lanzhou. Over two thousand acres have been planted in Sarachi, Suiyuan, and the results are good. Regarding the improvement of animal breeds, the farm previously purchased 35 heads of American beef cattle, 15 heads of dairy cattle, and 165 heads of other breeds. They are currently temporarily stored at the Qimen Ranch in Anhui and will be transported to Lanzhou soon. These breeds are excellent. When the actual improvement is carried out, the livestock in the Northwest are expected to have new developments. In order to improve the wool products of the province, a plan was previously made to establish a wool washing factory, a wool handicraft textile factory, and a wool laboratory. The farm has requested the provincial government to allocate the new factory in Miaotanzi and entrusted Chen Huasheng, a technician, to prepare for it. Technician Chen has gone east for some reason, but after returning to Lanzhou next week, he will start working on it.</p>

They chose to get married on the 10th of this month. At that time, the postal workers contributed 30 yuan for the betrothal gift, and his mother planned to contribute 16 yuan, preparing to send it to the bride's family to prepare a feast and welcome the bride. However, a cousin of Yu Lan believed that the betrothal gift was too small and demanded that it be increased to 200 yuan, along with two pieces of gold jewelry and 10 yuan for clothing. Panlin was unable to raise the funds temporarily and postponed the wedding date. He went out alone to the pond next to the Xiaotaoyuan Archway in Dongda Pond and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Because no one rescued him, he drowned. At 5:00 PM the following afternoon, two villagers recovered the body. Yesterday (13th) at 10:30 AM, Prosecutor Shen of the court, accompanied by Coroner Wang and bailiffs, went to the countryside for an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Jingjiang: Suspected Reactionary Fugitive Escapes</h3>
<p>Zheng Xixia, the young owner of Zheng Linji Pig Shop in the Second District of Xingang, had been studying at Guanghua University in Shanghai. Previously, he published the Ji Guang Weekly in Shanghai, serving as both editor and publisher. Due to his absurd remarks and suspected reactionary activities, he was arrested by the county party headquarters' special agents and detained in the Public Security Bureau, and the case was reported to the province for instructions. More than a month has passed without a resolution. Unexpectedly, Zheng took the opportunity to escape over the wall at around 7:00 PM last night. Although detectives were sent out, there was no trace of him.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Arrest of Soil Traffickers at Lao Hong Port</h3>
<p>Lao Hong Port in the eighth district of Nantong is the easternmost port along the river in the county. Because it is under county district jurisdiction and close to Haimen, there are many unscrupulous people in the port who privately trade in opium. At the end of last month, the district office, in order to eliminate these bad elements, dispatched detectives who arrested five opium traffickers, including Yu Jiqing, Yang Qilang, and Liu Donglin. District Chief Huang attached great importance to this and refused all pleas for leniency, sending all the criminals to the county government for legal action. Now, the county government and district office, in order to get to the bottom of the matter, have secretly sent more personnel to the port to seek evidence.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Hangzhou-Pingtang Embankment to be Repaired in Phases</h3>
<p>According to the report submitted by the Hangzhou-Pingtang Seawall Engineering Office to the Zhejiang Construction Department regarding the various construction projects for the 25th year, officials were dispatched to conduct a review and prioritize the most urgent repairs. Preparations are underway to start construction, to be carried out in three phases: (1) Projects that are time-sensitive and should be prepared for construction first include the various projects for repairing the embankment foot and water barriers under the names of Du, Zhong, Li, Qi, Qian, Bing, and Dong, among others; (2) Projects that urgently need repair this year include the various projects for dismantling and rebuilding the first embankment under the name of Jiechong, etc.; (3) Projects for repairing the embankment piles under the name of Kenianzuo, etc., and the stone embankment and stone seawall repair projects under the name of Sizhi Zhuan. The situation of continued subsidence of the embankment body at Wuduozi should be closely monitored during the high tide period, and construction personnel should be instructed to patrol and inspect at all times.</p>
<h3>Yuyao: Salt Crisis Temporarily Resolved</h3>
<p>The Yaochang Zhejiang East Salt Introduction Public Factory has been rejecting the collection of its salt quota for this year, causing salt farmers to face destitution for eight months. Repeated petitions have had little effect. Salt farmers, left with no other choice, gathered tens of thousands of people to petition again. The transport office, recognizing the hardships on both sides, and in order to maintain local security and the livelihood of the salt farmers, specially dispatched Commissioner Wei Hongmo to Yuyao on the 5th to handle the matter. He convened a meeting with the directors and representatives of the trade unions, inquiring in detail. On the morning of the 8th, at 9:00 a.m., another meeting was held, attended by trade union representative Song Gongyan, district directors Gao Pengzhen and Yu Xiaorong, and salt farmer representatives Wang Xizheng and Yuan Gongqi, among over a hundred others. Field Director Zuo Jinghong presided over the meeting, and Wei Hongmo reported that he was dispatched to the field to resolve the issue of the Zhejiang East salt collection at an 80% discount, hoping that the salt farmers would understand and make concessions. Then, Yuan Gongting passionately argued that there was no reason to refuse the collection, and described the current situation of the salt field. Others spoke in succession, and the atmosphere at the meeting became tense. Then, methods were discussed, and after several rounds of consultation, a compromise was reached: each slab of 381 catties would be temporarily reduced to 300 catties, and the original quota would be restored when the factory's sales increased. Other details were also agreed upon by both parties, and it is hoped that collection will resume soon. It is reported that Wei has left Yuyao for Shaoxing to discuss everything with the General Management Office of Zhejiang East Salt.</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin's Northern Journey and the Various Reactions It Evokes (Special Dispatch from Beiping)</h3>
<p>Wang Kemin, who was appointed as the chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, decided to come north for inspection and negotiations, and then returned south more than a month ago. During this period, there have been repeated rumors of his return to the north, but it has not yet materialized. However, the authorities here are constantly looking forward to his arrival, and even the Japanese, who are responsible for mediation, have always taken a welcoming attitude towards Wang's coming north. However, amidst this widespread welcome, there are two types of people who feel the most uncomfortable: one is the kind of vagrant Japanese, and the other is the Chinese traitors and villains under the protection and command of these vagrants. When the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Seishiro Itagaki, came to Pingjin earlier, these people tried their best to flatter and make trouble. As a result, the Kwantung Army, under its established policy, allowed them to provide support, and they became arrogant and expressed all kinds of noise and ugly behavior towards Wang Kemin's decision to come north, in order to prevent Sino-Japanese negotiations in North China from ever getting on the right track, so as to fulfill their private desire of "fishing in troubled waters." It was also inevitable. Wang's departure to the north on September 1st was not clearly expressed by the Japanese and our North China authorities, but the various ugly behaviors performed by the vagrants, traitors, and villains were already quite spectacular. A brief account is as follows:</p>
<p>When the news that Wang Kemin had departed from Shanghai to the north on the 1st reached Pingjin, the vagrants, traitors, and villains here immediately felt uneasy and rushed around to discuss and were extremely busy. In addition to fabricating three kinds of rumors: (1) it was said that Wang's decision to come north was based on a secret order from someone, which would centralize North China. The purpose of the rumor was to encourage the Japanese to suspect; (2) it was said that Wang would use his financial resources to buy off so-and-so and the lower-level cadres of so-and-so, and would divide the relationship between so-and-so and so-and-so. The purpose of the rumor was to scare the real power holders in North China, so-and-so and so-and-so, and to make them and their cadres suspicious of each other. The plan was particularly vicious; (3) it was said that Wang was carrying a huge amount of legal tender, 10 million yuan, which would be used in North China, and that he would transport the silver stored in Pingjin to the south. The purpose of this rumor was to incite a group of short-sighted North China citizens. On the other hand, they planned various concrete resistance measures against Wang himself, such as fabricating names to send telegrams refusing his coming north, and using the names of public representatives to run to the doors of the Chinese and Japanese authorities here, asking them not to show welcome to Wang. These are the two most prominent aspects. At this time, their intention was to intercept Wang's coming north head-on.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the plan to intercept was not successful. Wang arrived in Dalian on the 3rd, and met with the Kwantung Army authorities and the South Manchuria Railway authorities there. Moreover, the staff officer of the Japanese Garrison Army in Tianjin, Senta, went to Dalian from Tianjin to discuss everything. For a time, the situation in North China seemed to be unfolding. Although the outcome is still uncertain, even this vague trend is enough to make a group of vagrants, traitors, and villains extremely uneasy. In addition, there was a rumor that Shi would go to Shenyang first, directly contact the Kwantung Army side, and then come to Pingjin. Therefore, the anxiety of these people was particularly evident. In addition to the newspapers under their command making all kinds of slanders and attacks on Wang personally, they further prepared various practical actions to resist Wang's resolute arrival in Pingjin. The most ridiculous thing was that they sent a telegram to warn Wang, saying that "the Japanese side has already determined the specific methods for economic cooperation in North China, and has already implemented them before Wang's trip to the north. If Wang rashly comes north, he will inevitably fail to get the point." It also said that "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China is gradually making considerable progress, and people in the economic circles all hope to proceed in an orderly manner according to the existing plan, and hold a serious opposition attitude towards his coming north." In fact, they are all creating atmosphere. Their intention is to make Wang lose heart and return to the south, or at most stay in Dalian and not come to Pingjin. Unexpectedly, this plan also failed. Wang finally arrived in Tianjin by Japanese ship from Dalian on the 8th. Therefore, their plan to resist Wang entered the stage of concrete action.</p>
<p>The Japanese ship Changping Maru, on which Wang was riding, arrived at the Tianjin coast at 11:00 a.m. on the 8th. Before it arrived at the shore, more than a hundred vagrants in disheveled clothes, who had been bought off, were led by several people to make all kinds of disturbances and noises near the pier. Each of them held small flags in their hands and shouted chaotic slogans, and distributed leaflets to oppose Wang's landing. The title of the leaflet was "A Public Announcement to the People of North China." The wording was quite laughable, and the writing was also quite clumsy. Among them, Wang was described as a "bureaucrat," and Wang's personal physiological state was involved, directly calling him "blind" and "blind ghost." Its childishness is not worth a smile, but their anxiety about Wang's coming north is clearly revealed. What is laughable is that Wang "wants to turn North China into a world of paper money, just like the underworld money burned for the dead... May we ask, if North China has no cash and only a few messy paper bills left, can we still buy rice to eat and clothes to wear?" The intention is obviously to fool a group of citizens who do not understand the role of paper money, and deliberately use this stimulating tone. In fact, since the currency reform last year, the residents of North China are not what they used to be. What is legal tender, what is reserve, and the role of the two in finance, have long been experienced and clearly understood. This kind of bad tone, in addition to having no impact, is only enough to make people laugh. Moreover, accusing Wang of transporting the silver stored in Pingjin is also a groundless, off-the-cuff statement. At the end of the leaflet, there are the following sentences, "Compatriots, friends of all nationalities, please also express your sympathy... Come quickly, come quickly." Their ugliness is even more exposed. As for the slogans shouted by these vagrants, it is said that there are as many as twelve in total, but according to their content, back and forth, they only use the following three points: (1) desperately opposing the two nouns "North China" and "Central," as if "Central" is the government of another country, and "North China" is the territory of another country; (2) desperately emphasizing the two points of cash and paper money, in order to incite a group of short-sighted citizens; (3) desperately attacking Wang personally with irrelevant abusive words such as "blind," "running dog," "bureaucrat," etc. In fact, this kind of propaganda, in the impression caused by a group of people, is extremely bad, then the resulting counter-result must be that the more they make trouble, the more enthusiastic the hearts of a group of people supporting Wang's coming north will be.</p>
<p>After learning about the various disturbances in Tianjin, the vagrants, traitors, and villains in Beiping also immediately showed a state of commotion. In addition to having prepared all kinds of troubles and actions in case Wang should come to Ping, they also fabricated rumors and promoted Wang's embarrassment in Tianjin, in order to exaggerate the success of their plan, and the ×× Evening News under their command printed an extra edition, saying that there were more than a thousand representatives of the people of Pingjin in Tianjin who refused Wang to land. The reporter went out to patrol at about 6:00 p.m. From the east city to the west city, in various thoroughfares, small alleys, common entertainment venues, and tramways, there were people with pale faces and thin bodies, hair two or three inches long, and ragged clothes like opium addicts, selling extra editions loudly. The price was extremely cheap, but few people bought them. When people heard that it was the extra edition issued by the ×× Evening News, which chose its address next to the Ping Municipal Public Security Bureau and relied on its protection, they couldn't help but smile dumbly and immediately knew what was contained in it without having to buy it. When the reporter came back after 10:00 p.m., he still heard the sound of "extra edition, extra edition" incessantly, which shows that it has not been completely sold out, and the poor sales are evident.</p>
<p>At present, after Wang Kemin arrived in Tianjin, he has made extremely tactful and sincere replies to the three questions raised by them under the name of the "East Asia Association," which they arbitrarily fabricated. They probably have no chance to take advantage of Wang's replies. At the same time, the authorities here have issued a notice strictly prohibiting this kind of illegal organization that falsely borrows names, saying that once it is found out or reported and confirmed, it will be charged with the crime of gangsters gathering to disturb the local area. It is thought that their arrogance may be slightly reduced. Whether they have any new tricks to play depends on the sincerity of the Japanese authorities in cooperating to crack down on them.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>New British Ambassador, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon. Important Remarks Made on the Ship. British Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged, Hoping for Mutual Understanding Between China and Japan. Economic Aid to China Requires Cooperation Between the Three Countries. —Landing This Morning, Determined to Proceed to Beijing Late the Following Night to Present Credentials—</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the newly appointed British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen, arrived in China to take office after passing through Japan. He was accompanied by his wife, two daughters, and Mr. Blackburn, Chinese Counselor of the British Embassy, who had gone to Japan to meet him, and Mr. Grahame, Secretary. They arrived in Shanghai on the British company ship Sirdar at 12:30 p.m. yesterday, staying on the ship and deciding to land only this morning. Because everyone had received prior notice, no one went to welcome them. Only a few Chinese and foreign news photographers boarded the ship to visit.</p>
<p>No Mission Except Socializing</p>
<p>In the ship's reception room, Ambassador Hughe met with Chinese and foreign reporters and made the following remarks. First, he said that he had never been to the Far East before and did not know much about various issues in the Far East, lacking practical experience. He was very pleased to be appointed as the ambassador to China, which gave him the opportunity to study. Before departing for China, he spent two months in Persia for the summer, because he wanted to learn more about the Far East, so he conveniently made a trip to Japan, meeting with the British ambassador to Japan and Japanese cabinet members. He received friendly treatment from the Japanese authorities, especially from Mr. Horiuchi, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, this was only a matter of socializing and there were no diplomatic contacts. In Tokyo, he also met with the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Xu (Shiying). Although Mr. Xu was not good at English and he did not know Chinese, he had a very pleasant conversation with the help of Mr. Blackburn's translation.</p>
<p>British Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Ambassador Hughe continued to talk about British policy toward the Far East, which has not changed at all. He had already talked about it to Chinese reporters in Tokyo, and it would not hurt to say it again. British diplomacy has its own fixed foundation and cannot be easily changed. It is willing to have good relations with any country in the world, and hopes that China and Japan can understand each other and increase their friendship. As for the change of ambassadors to China this time, it is entirely a matter of personnel and has nothing to do with diplomatic policy. Furthermore, Britain does not want to ally with any country to oppose other countries. We can examine British history to prove what he said. Although Britain once allied with France to resist Germany, it was because Germany was in the position of aggressor at that time.</p>
<p>Economic Aid Requires Cooperation</p>
<p>As for the joint British-Japanese cooperation to provide economic assistance to China, Ambassador Hughe said that this is a matter between China, Britain, and Japan, and cannot be achieved by joint British-Japanese cooperation alone. It must be achieved through joint cooperation between China, Britain, and Japan. When Ambassador Hughe talked about this, the reporter asked whether Britain would lend money to China. He replied that it had to consider the situation and could not be decided immediately. Ambassador Hughe continued to answer reporters' questions, saying that smuggling in North China had gradually decreased due to the proper handling by the Chinese government. The Japanese side also has a considerable responsibility in this matter, and hopes to help solve it. As for the establishment of an inspection office by the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, which has invisibly opened up smuggled goods, he only saw the report in yesterday's newspaper and did not know the situation, so he was not in a position to disagree.</p>

<p>Same Principles for Income Tax</p>
<p>A reporter from a Western newspaper asked about Britain's attitude towards China's collection of income tax from foreigners. Ambassador Hughe said that Britain's attitude on this issue, in principle, cannot be opposed, because all countries collect income tax. However, it is believed that if China implements it universally nationwide, and foreigners from all countries can comply with it, then British citizens cannot be an exception. In general, equal treatment is required. Ambassador Hughe also said that the rumor that Britain will open an air route from Hong Kong to Shanghai is inaccurate. However, it has allowed Chinese airline planes to land in Hong Kong, which may be a misinterpretation. Ambassador Hughe also answered reporters' questions, saying: (1) He has only seen reports about the Chengdu incident and has not heard anything about it personally. However, he hopes that China and Japan can have a satisfactory solution. (2) What is Britain's attitude towards Japan's intention to expand its influence in the Shanghai International Settlement and increase the number of Japanese directors on the Board of Directors? He has not heard of it and there is no talk about it.</p>
<p>The British Embassy Will Not Move to Beijing for the Time Being</p>
<p>Ambassador Hughe also told reporters that an embassy of a country should be located in the capital of the country. The British Embassy has now set up an office in Beijing, but because of the address, it cannot be completely moved from Peiping to Beijing and will temporarily retain the Peiping Embassy. The current office of the Beijing Embassy is the former consulate, which is still rented from the Beijing Customs and is not self-built. He plans to stay in Beijing for six months each year and go to Peiping for six months. After arriving in Shanghai today, he is scheduled to take a train to Beijing on the evening of the 16th. However, the date of presenting credentials is still to be decided after contacting the authorities in Beijing. Ambassador Hughe concluded by saying that there are currently no new diplomatic issues between China and Britain. In the border dispute between Yunnan and Burma, the two countries have already sent representatives to jointly survey with representatives of neutral countries. Although work is currently suspended due to the climate there, it will continue as soon as the climate is suitable, and he believes that a satisfactory solution can be obtained in the near future.</p>
<p>Staying Overnight on the Ship and Landing This Morning</p>
<p>The Sirdar was docked on the Jiangmian River between the 11th and 12th pontoon bridges. Ambassador Hughe stayed overnight on the ship yesterday. Only Secretary Grahame led the two daughters to land for a short visit yesterday afternoon and then returned to the ship. Mr. Ho Wu, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, and Mr. Brenan, the British Consul General in Shanghai, are scheduled to take a specially prepared British naval boat to the ship to greet them at 9:30 this morning, together with Tang Shixuan, the representative of Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city, and Zhou Jue, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At 10:30, they will take Ambassador Hughe and his wife to the Renji Road Pier to land. At 11:15, Ambassador Hughe inspected the honor guard of the British Lancashire Regiment stationed in China inside the British Consulate on the Bund to receive respect. He will stay in Shanghai for three days and stay at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Following diplomatic conventions, all official banquets will be declined before presenting his credentials, except for private social engagements.</p>
<p>Ambassador Hughe's Demeanor and Brief Biography</p>
<p>Ambassador Hughe is of medium height. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he wore a beige piqué coat, white piqué trousers, and white suede shoes. He answered reporters' questions sincerely and his attitude was very amiable. Ambassador Hughe is exactly 50 years old this year, born on March 26, 1886. He graduated from the London School of Economics and Political Science and Balliol College, Oxford University. In 1908, he began to enter the diplomatic world and served as a member of the British delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. He was later promoted to First Secretary of the embassy abroad. In 1926, he was promoted to Counselor of the Embassy in Belgium. After that, he served as Minister to various Baltic countries. This time, he was transferred from Minister to Iran to China and promoted to Ambassador. Ambassador Hughe is very studious. Since being appointed as the Ambassador to China, he has hired a Chinese teacher to teach him Chinese language and practice calligraphy. He has great ambitions for promoting Sino-British relations.</p>
<h3>Chen Jie, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chen Jie, the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, left Beijing on the 5:00 p.m. express train the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 10:50 p.m. According to news from the Chen residence, Mr. Chen came here to take care of private matters and has no official business. He returned to Beijing last night. Zou Lin was also traveling with him.</p>
<h3>Citizen Oath Completed Yesterday. Enthusiastic Participation Reached Over One Million</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the citizen oath of all citizens in the city was handled yesterday by the National Election Office, which divided the city into 153 districts, with a swearing-in office in each district. From 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., there was enthusiastic participation in each office. The special area was crowded. Therefore, due to the large number of participants, some extended the time to after 6:00 p.m. Although there are no accurate statistics on the total number of citizen certificates issued, it must be more than one million. This is because yesterday happened to be a holiday, and the swearing-in offices were densely distributed, so citizens could participate nearby. Moreover, in order to popularize the oath, those who had not registered before could also make up for it, resulting in an even larger number of people. Furthermore, the progress of the general public's understanding of civic rights is also evident from this, which is gratifying.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the River Pilot Association, etc., Return to Shanghai. Allowed to Recommend One Observer to the National Congress</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the five group members of the A-type boat crew groups in the city's transportation industry, the River Pilot Association, the Boat Association, etc., previously sent representatives Jiang Kemin and others to Beijing to petition the National Election General Office for the quota of representatives to the National Congress. After contacting Mr. Zhang Daofan of the office several times, the result was that the five groups were allowed to jointly recommend one observer to attend the National Congress. The representatives who went to Beijing were satisfied and have returned to Shanghai to report the progress to the members of each group.</p>
<h3>Polish Minister, Wei Dentao, Arrived in Shanghai by Ship from Japan</h3>
<p>According to the New News Agency, Mr. Wei Dentao, the Polish Minister to China, went to Japan on July 26 with his wife to escape the summer heat, and it has been more than a month. According to news from the embassy, Mr. and Mrs. Wei are scheduled to leave Japan on the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Chichibu Maru on the 13th to return to their posts, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th.</p>
<h3>The Money Trade Association Sent Letters to Various Firms Yesterday to Study the Income Tax Rate and Submit Opinions Within One Week to Compile Contributions for Government Adoption</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association recently announced that the income tax regulations promulgated by the Central Government will be levied in accordance with the prescribed tax rates. In order to seek full public support, and with the intention of contributing opinions as much as possible before implementation, yesterday it specially notified all member firms to study separately and collect opinions to contribute to the government's standing committee. The notice said, "Dear Sirs, it has been found that the provisional regulations for the implementation of income tax by the National Government have been promulgated. It is necessary to study whether the various tax rates set are suitable for the situation of our country's merchants and people. After deliberation by the executive committee, it was decided that the association will send the provisional regulations for income tax to each firm and ask them to consider each article in detail. If there are any opinions, please contribute them to the association within one week so that they can be compiled and handled. (Omitted below)"</p>
<h3>The Nanyang Business Delegation Can Return to Shanghai at the End of Next Month. Many Orders from Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Business Delegation, hosted by the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, included 20 members, all factory representatives of the association. Led by the head of the delegation, Gao Shiheng, they left Shanghai in July and traveled through Little Luzon, Surabaya, Batavia, and other ports, and are now in Singapore. They will leave Singapore within days, detour to Penang and Bangkok, Siam, and then return north, arriving in Shanghai at the end of October. According to news from the industrial and commercial circles, the delegation brought many shipments from various factories for exhibition in various places. Many overseas Chinese visited them. Therefore, they have a deep impression of the progress of the motherland's industry and the excellence of its products. Because of the inconvenience of transportation, only one or two samples of each product were selected, which is still not enough to satisfy the wishes of the overseas Chinese. At the same time, overseas Chinese contacted the various members of the delegation to order many orders, so the success of this trip can be predicted to be satisfactory. In the future, after the delegation returns to China, there will be new developments in trade with Nanyang.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Raise Funds to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebrations</h3>
<p>The city's dance halls enthusiastically sponsored raising funds to purchase aircraft to present to the government as a memorial to President Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. They scheduled one day each to hold entertainment evenings, and the income was used to purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations. The results were excellent. The Dashin Dance Hall on Nanjing Road is scheduled to hold an entertainment evening today. No tickets will be sold and no donations will be collected in the hall. The four sisters Liang Saizhen, Saizhu, Saishan, and Saihu were specially invited to participate in volunteer performances. The Florence sisters' class and the golden-voiced black beauty Kailan Tidecos will perform novel and beautiful songs and dances. There are also dance girls from the hall participating in singing. Tea dance starts at 5:00 p.m., and Sullivan cakes will be served.</p>
<p>The Noodle Shop Industry Association collected aviation patriotic donations. The results have been good since the beginning. In August, Songyuelou collected 18 yuan, 27 cents; Longshunguan, 8 yuan, 41 cents; Suxiangzhai, 25 yuan, 92 cents; Leyilou, 7 yuan, 64 cents; Guihuating, 11 yuan, 06 cents; Songyunlou, 15 yuan, 47 cents; Shi Bingji, 1 yuan, 09 cents; Songhelou, 1 yuan, 24 cents; Laofuxing, 41 cents; and Juyuanzhai, 3 yuan, 78 cents. They have been handed over to the captain's office for counting.</p>
<h3>JICHA Establishes Inspection Office - Zheng Lai Studies Proper Methods - Awaiting Investigator's Report - Concrete Decision Imminent</h3>
<p>A report from Shen Shi states that the establishment of an inspection office by the Jicha Political Affairs Committee to register private goods for inspection and the collection of examination fees has become a reality. All parties believe that this has the potential to undermine tariffs and affect domestic industry and commerce. Powerful business groups have expressed their opposition and requested the Ministry of Finance to revoke it as soon as possible. This matter has attracted the deep attention of the Ministry of Finance. After deciding to come to Shanghai, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi immediately summoned Customs Superintendent Zheng Lai to inquire about the truth of the matter and instructed Zheng to devise a proper solution. Upon receiving the order, Zheng has already conducted research based on the latest report from the Tianjin Customs. At the same time, Li Qingxuan, a counselor dispatched by the Ministry of Finance, and Bai Licha, a tax affairs official from the Anti-Smuggling Section, went to Beiping for investigation. Except for Li, who was unable to go north immediately due to illness, Bai Licha has already set out and is expected to provide an accurate report soon. Zheng is currently awaiting the investigation report to quickly decide on a solution and submit it to the Ministry for approval. A concrete result is expected within the next week. It is also understood that the Ministry of Finance, in consideration of public opinion, will prevent the Jicha Inspection Office from levying any fees or taxes before a proper solution is decided. However, whether the original plan of the Jicha Inspection Office can be revoked is difficult to predict. It is generally believed that the measures Zheng Lai, the Customs Superintendent, will devise will benefit domestic industry and commerce.</p>

<p>The Friendship Travel Group, located at 810 Niuzhuang Road in this city, organized its fourth North China trip last year, leaving a deep impression on participating comrades. Even those who did not participate were prompted to pay considerable attention. Indeed, North China is rich in history and national character, and people in the Southeast are eager to experience it firsthand. Therefore, the group continued to organize two special train trips north this year, both of which were fully booked, leaving many comrades with regrets. The group has now negotiated with the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, Beining, and PingSui railway authorities to operate a special sightseeing train for its seventh North China trip.</p>

<h3>End of September and October Approaching - All Industries Fully Prepared for Smooth Transition - Banks and Money Shops Gradually Busy with Collection - Loans Dependent on Borrower's Credit</h3>
<p>The end of September, the autumn festival settlement period, and the end of October, the credit loan period, are approaching. Banks and money shops are gradually busy with collection. The autumn managers' meeting of various money shops has decided to hold a meeting on the 19th to study business reforms. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Autumn Festival Approaching</p>
<p>The end of September, the autumn festival (i.e., the Mid-Autumn Festival on August 15th of the lunar calendar), the settlement period for industry and commerce is approaching rapidly. Various factories, businesses, and companies are issuing lists to their respective clients to handle collection matters. Therefore, the collection work of banks and money shops is gradually becoming busy. Member banks of the Bankers' Association will take a day off on September 30th in accordance with the association's regulations. Member money shops of the Money Shops Association will take a day off on September 30th in accordance with industry regulations. As for various factories, businesses, and companies, they will also be closed on this day to organize everything.</p>
<p>Preparations in All Industries</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, the Central, Communications, and Bank of China have made every effort to regulate interbank finance and assist industry and commerce to develop. Various industries have gradually become active. At the same time, various industries, in view of the market downturn, have made full preparations for their own operations. Therefore, the end of September, the autumn festival, will be able to pass smoothly without worry. As for banks and money shops, they have always been particularly cautious about various loans to industry and commerce. Therefore, no unfortunate events are expected to occur at the end of September, the autumn festival.</p>
<p>Money Shops Meeting</p>
<p>Since the Money Shops Association received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to reform its operations, it has held managers' meetings of various shops quarterly every year to study matters that should be promoted or reformed in its operations. The operations of various shops have gradually improved, such as adopting the banking system, handling custody services, agency services, promoting mortgage loans, absorbing various deposits, abolishing the cash reserve, jointly handling various loans, etc. A fall manager's meeting will be held at the association at 2:00 PM on the 19th to study reform matters.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Credit</p>
<p>Long-term credit loans in Shanghai have traditionally been divided into the end of April and the end of October. Now that the end of October is approaching, banks, money shops, and Ningbo, Hankou, and other money shops have made a large number of loans in Shanghai, totaling more than 50 million yuan. They have already begun to contact the various borrowing factories, companies, and businesses separately to negotiate matters such as renewals, recalls, and new loans. Because banks and money shops have suffered greatly from long-term credit loans due to the previous market downturn, they are now particularly cautious and decide on recalls, renewals, and new loan targets based on the borrower's credit.</p>
<h3>National Economic Commission Decides - Standard Price for Autumn Cocoons - Based on Reeling Yield - Manufacturers Prepare to Purchase</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the fresh cocoons of the autumn crop in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will be available on the market in late September. The Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission has decided on the standard price for autumn cocoons. Silk cocoon manufacturers and organizations are borrowing money from the financial sector to purchase cocoons. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Autumn Cocoons Soon to be Available</p>
<p>The silkworm seeds for the autumn crop in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are mostly the improved seeds distributed by the silk improvement agencies of the two provinces. In addition, staff are dispatched at any time to guide new breeding methods, so the silkworms are developing quite well. The autumn cocoons in Haining, Yuhang, Xiaoshan, Chongde, Jiaxing, and other places in Zhejiang are about to begin spinning. The early batch of autumn cocoons in Wuxi, Liyang, Danyang, Jintan, and other places in Jiangsu has already begun spinning, and the late batch has also entered a deep sleep and begun to eat leaves. Therefore, the new cocoons for the autumn crop in various counties and townships in the two provinces will be available on the market in late September. At that time, various cocoon markets will also open scales simultaneously.</p>
<p>Standard Price from the Economic Commission</p>
<p>In view of the sharp drop in silk prices and the imminent arrival of autumn cocoons on the market, the Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission estimates that the total harvest of autumn cocoons this year will be about 400,000 to 500,000 dan. If silk cocoon manufacturers take a wait-and-see approach due to the decline in silk prices, the losses to silkworm farmers will be unimaginable. Conversely, if the price of autumn cocoons is too high, cocoon merchants will also suffer losses. Tan Xihong, the acting director of the committee, convened a meeting in Hangzhou the other day to seek remedies. It was decided that the standard price for autumn cocoons this year will be based on the reeling yield. For reeling yields from 430 jin to 500 jin, the cocoon price is 32 yuan to 26 yuan per dan. A fresh cocoon with a reeling yield of 460 jin is priced at 29 yuan per dan, which is notified to the cocoon industry in various provinces and cities for compliance.</p>
<p>Sufficient Registration in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Textile Committee announced the invitation to merchants to purchase autumn cocoons within the province and carried out registration. After the deadline of the 10th of this month, it is understood that the committee has approved a total of 233 cocoon markets and 1,663 cocoon stoves in the province, with a cocoon purchase quota of 174,800 dan. Therefore, cocoon purchase registration has reached its quota and there will be no surplus. As for all silk cocoon manufacturers who have been approved to purchase autumn cocoons in Zhejiang Province, they must pay a deposit of 100 yuan per stove within five days. After holding the deposit receipt and completing all the necessary cocoon purchase procedures, they can go to the production area and start purchasing in accordance with the standard price.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Prepare to Purchase</p>
<p>Although silk cocoon manufacturers in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhejiang, and other places are aware of the decline in silk prices in the European and American markets, this is due to the influence of silk sales in a certain country. In addition, the output of autumn cocoons in a certain country this year is lower than the previous year. It is expected that silk prices will not fall further. Therefore, various silk cocoon manufacturers are still preparing to purchase. In addition to applying for registration with the Silk Control Association, they are also separately organizing agencies to contact the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Chinese Farmers' Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Zhejiang Local Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank, and various money shops such as Fuyuan to negotiate loans. Most of them are about to reach an agreement. The methods are the same as for spring loans. The silk cocoon merchants prepare a deposit of 30% or 50%, and the fresh cocoons collected are used as collateral. When the cocoons are collected, personnel will be sent by the lending bank to supervise. Manufacturers whose loans have been successful have all scheduled to depart around the 20th of this month to purchase.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation - To Hold Second Meeting</h3>
<p>To Discuss Methods for Inland Proof and Cargo Passes. Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation previously convened a conference because the Ministry of Finance required artificial silk interweaving products to have import duty receipts for artificial silk in exchange for cargo passes, which caused many obstacles for merchants selling them in transit. They also petitioned the Customs. Now, Shanghai has already requested a solution from the Customs through the Shanghai Silk Satin Industry Association. Before the Ministry of Finance changes the method, the industry association can provide proof for the exchange of cargo passes. However, this cannot be done in the same way in the inland areas. The federation had previously instructed industry members in various locations to submit methods and local conditions for research. Now, most of the reports have been received. In order to discuss concrete methods, the federation has scheduled a second joint meeting of representatives in mid-September to jointly discuss the progress.</p>
<h3>Joint Seating Method for Eliminating Opium Smokers - Household Pledge Completed - General Inspection Scheduled to Begin on the 15th - Expand Hospitals to Accommodate Opium Smokers as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that the city's general campaign against drugs and opium ended on the 10th. In order to implement the joint responsibility system and eliminate opium smokers, the Municipal Public Security Bureau is conducting a city-wide household pledge to guarantee this. Special orders have been issued to various sub-bureaus and district offices to follow and complete the process within a week. After receiving the order, each district office dispatched long-term police officers from the household registration office to carry forms and conduct household pledge guarantees within their jurisdiction. Through the efforts of various district offices, the work has been completed. A "Check" character is posted on the door of each household that has filled out the form for identification purposes. All forms have been submitted to the General Bureau for review and processing.</p>
<p>Scheduled Inspection: After the city's general campaign against opium smokers ended on the 10th of this month, the total number of registered opium smokers (including those who voluntarily registered and obtained permits) was only over 43,000. Compared to the total population of the city, this is less than 1%. According to abstract statistics, although most are hiding in the concessions, there must be a considerable number of evaders in the urban areas. Therefore, in order to thoroughly eliminate opium smokers, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has specifically ordered all district offices to conduct a general household registration inspection throughout the city starting on the 15th of this month. Opium smokers or those who manufacture and traffic drugs who are discovered during the general inspection will be dealt with according to military law.</p>
<p>Expand Hospitals</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has noted that the number of opium smokers who have voluntarily applied for opium cessation has reached more than 5,000, but the number of contracted and designated hospitals for opium cessation is limited, resulting in failure to accommodate as many opium smokers as possible, causing regrets to those who urgently want to quit. In order to find ways to remedy this, the bureau has jointly discussed with the Shanghai Opium Prohibition Committee the expansion of the number of opium cessation hospitals, so that opium smokers who have already applied can be admitted to the hospital for opium cessation as soon as possible and escape from the bitter sea.</p>
<h3>Silk Satin Industry Telegraphs Ministry of Finance to Inquire - Should Certificates Be Issued for New Goods from Shandong and Tianjin? - Urges Industry Members to Quickly Register Inventory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Satin Industry Association previously believed that the Ministry of Finance's "Measures for Inspecting and Clearing Artificial Silk Fabrics" caused many obstacles for wholesale and retail merchants. The association's chairman, Luo Qinghua, and others petitioned in Beijing twice and repeatedly stated the difficulties to the Jianghai Customs. The Customs understood the situation and requested that the Tax Affairs Department formulate relief measures to be submitted to the Ministry for instructions. Before the relief measures were announced, the association was allowed to issue certificates for legitimate goods for transportation and sale in exchange for transportation licenses, which has been in effect for some time. However, some members of the industry who had existing inventory, in addition to registering according to the deadline, and some non-member industry members, and some who were unaware of the benefits, have not yet cleared and registered their existing inventory. Now that the deadline has passed, in order to maintain legitimate goods and prevent the invasion of smuggled goods, the association has decided at a meeting of the Executive Committee to extend the inventory registration period for industry members by another week and publish a notice in the newspaper. The notice states: "The registration of all inventory of our association members has been largely completed. However, because the registration deadline has long passed, we are sincerely afraid that some non-member industry members and some who are unaware of the situation have not yet registered their existing inventory, which will inevitably cause obstacles in terms of transportation and sales. In order to maintain the legitimate goods of industry members and prevent the invasion of smuggled goods, our association strives for thoroughness. The 18th Executive Committee meeting on the 11th of this month decided to extend the inventory registration deadline to the 20th of this month. All our industry members, whether they are members or not, must apply for registration of their existing inventory within the deadline. If problems occur after this deadline, they will be responsible for their own consequences and our association will not be able to provide protection. This is solemnly declared." It is also heard that after the 17 Shandong industry members stationed in Shanghai all joined the association, the 50,000+ pieces of existing inventory were handed over to the Shengjing Silk and Satin Group for clearing and registration. However, after the registration deadline, there is no basis for how to handle the new goods arriving in Shanghai one after another. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. The telegram is transcribed below: "To Minister of Finance Kong in Nanjing. In addition to registration, should the raw materials for artificial silk or silk interweaving products after September 10 from Shandong Zhoucun, Tianjin, and other places be taxed in accordance with the order? When these goods are transported to Shanghai for distribution, should the association issue certificates? Please instruct. Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Silk Satin Industry Association, bows."</p>
<h3>Local Weather - Clear Yesterday - Autumn Sun Warm and Mildly Hot - Pacific Hurricane in Progress</h3>
<p>The continuous autumn rain in this city stopped only yesterday. The autumn sun was warm, and the climate was mildly hot. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Weather Clears: Since the entry into the White Dew solar term on the 8th, the climate in this city has turned cooler, and the continuous rain has been unpleasant. By the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the weather began to clear. Yesterday afternoon, the sky finally cleared, the autumn sun was warm, and the climate returned from cool to hot.</p>
<p>Hurricane Progress: According to the Observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday, the first hurricane that originated in the Pacific Ocean is now within a 120 nautical mile radius at 22 degrees North latitude and 133 degrees East longitude, heading northeast. The second hurricane is now within a 120 nautical mile radius at 20 degrees North latitude and 140 degrees East longitude, heading northwest. The strength of the winds is still unknown.</p>
<h3>French Franc Devaluation - China Not Affected</h3>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the drastic fall in the price of the French franc has caused unrest in the international financial market. Xin Xin News Agency reporters, based on the observation of economists, believe that it is caused by the instability of French politics and the wave of strikes with political implications. Some capitalists are taking the opportunity to confuse the market with rumors that the government will implement a ban on cash exports to prevent capital flight, profiting from it. Therefore, the phenomenon of the drastic fall in the price of the French franc is only temporary. If the political turmoil and the wave of strikes are resolved, it will tend to stabilize. As for the relationship between the fall in the price of the French franc and China's finance, it has little impact except for a slight hindrance to trade with France.</p>
<h3>Boiled Water Industry Holds Regular Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Economic Recession: Vegetable Markets Drastically Reduced, 760 Fewer Than Two Years Ago</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the deepening economic recession in this city, residents' lives have become increasingly frugal. This is most evident in the drastic reduction in the number of vegetable markets, as listed in the Public Works Department's tax reports for the past three years. In July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (i.e., two years ago), there were a total of 6,752 vegetable markets in the International Settlement. The total revenue from license fees from January to July was 196,932.17 yuan. In the same period of the 24th year of the Republic of China (i.e., last year), the number of vegetable markets was 6,534 (218 fewer than the previous year). The total revenue from license fees from January to July was 194,636.11 yuan. By July of this year, the number of vegetable markets had dropped to only 5,992 (a further reduction of 642 from the previous year). The total revenue from license fees from January to July was 187,307.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prominent Figures from the Party-State and Cultural Circles Mourned Mr. Gao Mengdan Yesterday; Over 500 People Attended, Including Wu Zhihui and Cai Yuanpei; Commercial Press Established a Gao Mengdan Memorial Scholarship of 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the death of Mr. Gao Mengdan, a respected elder in the cultural world and director of the Commercial Press, has been deeply mourned by all parties. Prominent figures such as Cai Yuanpei, Wang Shijie, Huang Renzhi, and colleagues from the Commercial Press, to commemorate the esteemed scholar, initiated a memorial service held yesterday at 2 PM at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: A total of over 500 people attended, including Cai Yuanpei, Wu Zhihui, Wang Shijie (represented by Lei Zhen), Huang Renzhi, Lei Zhen, Hu Yuzhi, Yan Renguang, Hu Pu'an, Xu Xinliu, Wang Yunwu, Chen Zhezheng, Wei Que, Zheng Baoshi, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Zhoujun, Li Shengwu, Xu Jilun, Zhang Yuanji, Xia Xiaofang, Liang Hejun, Xia Jianji, Li Bake, Shou Jingwei, Wu Guangjian, Zou Taofen, Zhou Yueran, Zhuang Yu, Wen Zongyao, Huang Jingwan, and all colleagues from the Commercial Press. Cai Yuanpei chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's Speech: Chairman Cai Yuanpei gave an opening speech, saying, "Today, we gather here to mourn Mr. Gao Mengdan. Mr. Gao was a man of wide knowledge and a good person throughout his life. Although advanced in years, he could still serve society and had specialized expertise. Alas, he succumbed to illness, and everyone, whether they knew him or not, mourns his passing. Mr. Gao embraced practical learning and put it into practice. His life's efforts were devoted to education and cultural undertakings. He was rich in new ideas and advocated innovation for the things of the old era. His advocacy for the adoption of the common calendar and simplified characters was truly due to their rationality. Mr. Gao was meticulous and unbiased. His contributions to the Commercial Press's compilation of textbooks were immense and created a unique color in the history of education. Now, the affairs of the Press are entrusted to Mr. Wang Yunwu, who is managing them well. I hope that future scholars will rise up and continue Mr. Gao's unfinished aspirations." Subsequently, Lei Zhen, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Weiqiao, Wu Zhihui, Wang Yunwu, and others delivered speeches one after another, praising Mr. Gao's life achievements at length, which are omitted for brevity.</p>
<p>Two Eulogies: (1) Eulogy from the Board of Directors of the Commercial Press: "Alas, among the three Gao brothers, you were known as the best. Fortunately, we were comrades, entrusting our hearts to you for a long time. Some for over twenty years, some for thirty. A great scholar came to the Press, and a grand building was established. You set up your thatched hut and discussed Han rituals. Looking far ahead, adapting to the times, nurturing the new and respecting the old, silently moving and gradually shifting, starting from small successes, progressing step by step, with monthly surpluses, using the ambition of Meng Jin, expanding outwards and strengthening internally, recruiting talented individuals, dividing them into departments, collectively compiling and editing, like planting trees. After ten years, we see the shade. At this time, the scale is largely determined, the foundation is solid, the branches and trunk are strong, capable of undertaking difficult tasks, capable of understanding the latitude and longitude. Not rash, not forgetting, not erring. All colleagues admire you. Success is achieved, and you entrusted the task to a worthy successor. Through great calamities, you remained steadfast. With a slide rule in hand, never ceasing your labor. Your virtue is steadfast, and you are a man of this kind. Why did Heaven take away our wise man? Looking up to the Great Wall, we feel lost on both sides. Straightforward advice is unheard, and requests for advice are unavailable. The clouds of Sichuan are ten thousand miles away, and the waves of Shanghai are a thousand fathoms deep. The flowing water is endless, and the cold wind is mournful. Your deeds remain on famous mountains, and your achievements are recorded on true stones." (2) Eulogy from the Colleagues of the Commercial Press: "On the thirteenth day of September in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, we, Zhuang Yu and other colleagues of the Commercial Press, respectfully offer flowers at the memorial service for Mr. Gao Mengdan, and declare: Since the passing of Mr. Gao, we colleagues have been filled with endless sorrow. We miss the absence of the blueprint and the uncertainty of the situation. It is like the loss of a firm boat in the vast sea, like the loss of wisdom's compass. The depth and breadth of this loss are truly profound. Mr. Gao's virtues are widely known. First, filial piety and fraternal love. A father acted as a father should, and a brother acted as a brother should, inheriting the blessings of the family and emulating the beauty of the carriage tracks. Second, trustworthiness and righteousness. Generous to others, showing your heart and soul. Lu Lian relied on your noble character, and Fan Shi valued you as a man of integrity. Furthermore, tacit understanding. Never seeking fame or fortune, only striving to the best of your ability. Moreover, simplicity and reason. Usually hating vulgarity and valuing vanity, and carefully observing and practicing what you believed in. Those who have interacted with Mr. Gao can all attest to this. Considering Mr. Gao's years of dedication to this Press, although only twenty-four years, his spirit was focused and thorough, and we still rely on it today. Therefore, what we colleagues record is what others have overlooked, and we cannot call it extravagant. For Mr. Gao possessed unceasing research and bore endless responsibility, thus his loyalty to this Press was pure and without expectation. Only because of his unceasing research did his insights often lead others. Only because of his endless responsibility was his dedication always more fervent than others. How can there be pretense or affectation? It comes from nature and flows to help you. Therefore, the success of this Press today is certainly due to his inspiration. We colleagues remember Mr. Gao, and we can only follow his teachings, serving as if he were always by our side. May Mr. Gao's spirit in heaven silently bless us."</p>
<p>Family's Response: Gao Jinxuan, representing the family, delivered a speech of thanks, briefly stating, "Today, we are grateful to the prominent figures from the Party-State and cultural circles for holding this memorial service. The family is deeply grateful. We, Jinxuan and others, will follow and not forget the aspirations of our ancestor."</p>
<p>Memorial Scholarship: The Commercial Press, to promote culture and commemorate the achievements of Mr. Gao Mengdan, has allocated 10,000 yuan to be deposited in a bank as the Gao Mengdan Academic Scholarship, awarding 1,000 yuan annually to those who have made creative contributions in academics.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners Oppose Reduction of Rickshaws: Held a General Meeting Yesterday; Set Date to Petition Party-Government Organs; Issued Declaration Requesting Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Rickshaw Association of the Special District held a general meeting yesterday morning to oppose the reduction of rickshaws, and set a date to petition the board of directors and other organizations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: At 9 AM yesterday morning, the Rickshaw Association of the Special District held a general meeting of rickshaw owners in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with over 500 attendees. Qiu Chunshan was sent by the association to provide guidance. Gu Songmao, Yin Zhiling, Wang Kunyi, Bao Zhenhuang, and Song Shixiang were elected as the presidium. Cheng Wanli served as the master of ceremonies. After performing the rituals, Yin Zhiling first reported on the significance of convening the meeting. Gu Songmao, Qiu Chunshan, and others then gave speeches, stating that it was unfair for the Public Works Department to reduce only rickshaws and not other vehicles, and that they should negotiate together.</p>
<p>Resolutions Passed: After discussion, the following resolutions were passed regarding the issue of reducing rickshaws: (A) The reduction of rickshaws directly infringes upon the business of rickshaw owners, cuts off the livelihood of rickshaw pullers, and indirectly affects social needs. We should unanimously oppose it. Resolution passed. (B) The motive of the Public Works Department in reducing rickshaws is to insult the legitimate business of Chinese people and to implement the monopoly of trams and buses operated by foreigners. This concerns national competition and the livelihood of the poor. We should request all sectors to uphold justice and provide practical assistance. Resolution passed. (C) Since its establishment, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee has been tasked with harming Chinese businesses and cutting off the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers, leading to repeated disputes and wasting public funds. We should request the Public Works Department to promptly abolish the superfluous Rickshaw Affairs Committee. Resolution passed. (D) We request the Public Works Department to fundamentally reorganize the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society and stop collecting membership fees from rickshaw pullers. Resolution passed. (E) Submit a petition to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and all Chinese Directors for assistance. Resolution passed. (F) All rickshaw owners will jointly file a record and petition the Ratepayers' Association Rickshaw Affairs Committee Board of Directors on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Declaration of the General Meeting: The Rickshaw Affairs Committee of the Public Works Department, since its establishment, has repeatedly demanded and nitpicked the public rickshaw industry, and the restrictions on rickshaw registration, etc., not only bankrupt our rickshaw industry but also cut off the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers. As for the establishment of the Mutual Aid Society, it has absorbed 400,000 yuan in membership fees, the blood and sweat of rickshaw pullers. All of us rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers are deeply saddened by all of this. Unexpectedly, the Public Works Department authorities, disregarding the previously announced resolution not to propose further reductions in public rickshaws, have recently used their political power to propose reducing the number of public rickshaws in order to implement their monopoly on buses, which they operate. This not only directly harms the business of our rickshaw owners and the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers but also indirectly affects the transportation needs of citizens, which is extremely significant. After deliberation at the early morning rickshaw owners' general meeting on September 13, it was resolved to unanimously oppose it. This concerns national competition, the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers, and the convenience of citizens. We hope that all elders from all sectors will provide unanimous assistance. The rickshaw industry will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers to Petition Public Works Department This Morning: Public Works Department Schedules Meeting to Discuss</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, since the Public Works Department proposed reducing the number of public rickshaws within the Settlement, rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers, due to their vital interests, have risen up in opposition. In addition to holding a general meeting to schedule a petition, rickshaw puller representatives Chen Hongji and others, based on the resolution of the 7th, will lead thousands of rickshaw pullers, holding flags and marching in formation, to the Public Works Department this morning at 10 AM to make a large-scale petition. After hearing the news, the Public Works Department specially sent the head of the Political Department, Robertson, and dispatched investigator Zhang Yingmei to invite Chen Guoliang, the chief representative of the rickshaw pullers, to the Political Department to inquire about everything. The representatives of the rickshaw pullers stated their intentions and demanded that the police department provide protection. Mr. Robertson dissuaded them, saying that if too many people came, armed measures would be necessary. After the mediation of translator Gao Yangeng, it was agreed that a small number of rickshaw pullers would be allowed to petition. Furthermore, the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Special Committee, after the previous meeting decided to reduce rickshaws and faced opposition, has scheduled another meeting for 5:30 PM today to discuss the matter. The Public Works Department Board of Directors has also scheduled a meeting for Wednesday (the 16th) afternoon to discuss concrete measures regarding this matter.</p>
<h3>Male Servant Murders Master Due to Resentment Over Dismissal: Shao Axing Dies Tragically; Tao Huxing Resigns Hastily</h3>
<p>Shao Axing, a native of Ningbo, 40 years old, formerly a comprador, accumulated capital and changed his business to an electric light shop, but failed due to the economic recession. He lived at No. 3, Lane B, Aidu Li, No. 13 Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession, as a sub-landlord, living on the second floor of a Tongzilou building, renting out the remaining rooms. The downstairs was rented to his sister, Wu Shao. Shao's wife, Lin, 35 years old this year, was normally dull. On the 15th day of the 7th lunar month, she went to her natal home at No. 89 Huadefang, Dalian Wan Road. Shao lived alone in the house. Last year, through an introduction, he hired Tao Huxing (34 years old) from Haiyan, Zhejiang as a servant. Recently, because of poor work performance, Shao dismissed Tao on the 10th of this month. However, Tao had nowhere to go for the time being, so he temporarily stayed at Shao's house at night, going out in the morning and returning at night. Although he was dismissed, the bunch of keys to Shao's house that he managed was still with him and had not been returned to the master. At 5 AM on the 13th, when Tao was opening the door to Shao's house to empty the chamber pot, he suddenly returned. Shao's sister and co-residents did not pay attention to him. At 8 o'clock, Tao, carrying a package, hurriedly went out. When a neighbor asked him where he was going, Tao replied that he was going back to his hometown. After Tao left, Shao's sister, Wu Shao, heard Shao moaning in his room upstairs in the downstairs parlor. She went upstairs and into the room to investigate and saw that Shao's bedding was covered in blood, and the smell of blood was pungent. There were wounds on the left corner of his head and his right cheek. When asked how he was injured, Shao could not speak, only gesturing with his hands and feet, unable to answer. His sister examined the locks of the boxes and iron chests in the room, which had all been opened and were in a mess. A four-foot-long square wooden stick used by the murderer was left next to the bed. The mosquito net on the bed was also torn by the iron nails on the murder weapon. She immediately reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate. According to Shao's co-residents, from the time the chamber pot was emptied in the morning until the incident was discovered, no one else entered or exited except for the dismissed servant Tao Huxing, who came and went in a hurry. From this, it was speculated that Tao Huxing, due to resentment over his dismissal, harbored hatred and killed Shao. After hitting Shao with a wooden stick, he opened the boxes, stole valuables, and fled. He was then sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment in a police car. On one hand, the detectives reported the situation to the head detective, ordering all detectives to investigate and arrest Tao Huxing to be brought to justice. However, Shao died in the hospital at 10 o'clock due to his severe injuries, after futile medical treatment. The hospital notified the police station to transport the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall, awaiting the dispatch of personnel from the Second Special Court today to examine the body.</p>

The number of visitors has remained crowded every day, and the businesses of the temporary market attached to the exhibition have been very prosperous. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close today, but due to the many requests from participating manufacturers to extend the exhibition period to facilitate the promotion of national products, it was decided after a meeting to allow an extension of one week, closing on the 20th of this month. The notice from the association is recorded below: The exhibition has been open for three weeks since its opening. Due to the many requests from manufacturers to extend the exhibition time to facilitate the promotion of national products, it was decided after a meeting to allow an extension of one week, closing on the 20th of this month.

After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Chen went to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and other places to negotiate the solicitation of goods, which was very busy. All parties expressed their appreciation for Mr. Chen's efforts to promote national products and held welcome meetings separately. However, due to the suddenness of the timing, the manufacturers were unable to prepare in time and have decided not to participate. To understand the production and sales situation of national products, Mr. Chen specially visited the America-Asia Silk Weaving Factory, the Great China Rubber Factory, the China-France Pharmacy, the Taikang Food Company, and other major national products factories yesterday morning, and procured a large batch of national products to bring back for new displays to meet the needs of overseas Chinese.

<h3>First Special Court: Issues Arrest Warrant for Gu Yubo</h3>
<p>The Huamei Bank suddenly collapsed after operating for less than a month. The key responsible persons, Gu Yubo, etc., fled without a trace. After the rights holders filed complaints with the First Special District Local Court, they have been unable to summon them. On the 8th of this month, the court continued to hold a hearing, but only Sun Wenkui, one of the defendants, denied being the manager of the bank, claiming that he was an employee of the bank. However, the agent lawyer of the plaintiffs, Wu Peng, presented the bank's payroll, which clearly stated Sun's position as assistant manager, and the salary he received was also that of an assistant manager. Sun had no way to deny it. Therefore, after a confidential hearing that day, Judge Huang Rijie ordered Sun to be released on bail by his defense lawyer, Lin Yingqing, and rescheduled the hearing for the afternoon of September 24. As for Gu Yubo, because he fled without a trace, Judge Huang approved the issuance of an arrest warrant. The plaintiffs found that the other defendants, Bao Ziwen and Chen Zai, were in Hangzhou and Shaoxing respectively, and the court sent letters to the courts in Hangzhou and Shaoxing to assist in the summons. It is unknown whether they will be able to appear in court when the trial opens.</p>

His return to the country will definitely contribute his research findings to our society. Pang delivered a reply speech, briefly describing his investigation into the medical education of various countries, and expressed the hope that people from all walks of life would promote the new medical cause in China. The banquet ended happily around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Guohua Bank Adds Employment Guarantee Deposits</h3>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association's resolution to abolish extra petty cash accounts is about to be implemented, and it stipulates that any security deposits or collateral money paid by workers must be deposited in a bank to earn interest. In order to meet the needs of society, Guohua Bank in this city has established employment guarantee deposits at its Hongkou branch. Fixed interest rates are given based on the length of employment. This measure allows employers to obtain reliable guarantees and avoid the trouble of managing and keeping the money safe, while allowing workers to avoid worrying about the movement of the security deposit and obtain considerable benefits to compensate for the loss of abolishing extra petty cash accounts. It can be described as a win-win situation. It is a good method with good intentions.</p>
<h3>Huge Culvert Installed on the Bund to Prevent Backflow During High Tide; Construction to be Completed Within a Month</h3>
<p>The terrain of this city is low-lying, and it is crisscrossed by water pipes, causing backflow during high tide.

Shou Yicheng, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, has also returned from his investigation in Japan, and his knowledge and experience are sure to be insightful. Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country recently established a specialist position at the International Office, dispatching economic expert Yang Yinpu and legal expert Xu Gongsu to study economics and law. They are about to take office, and thus a special meeting will be held at the Bank Club at 5:00 PM on Friday, the 18th of this month, to welcome and bid farewell, as well as to listen to insightful opinions.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Elevating Low-Lying Roads</h3>
<p>Low-lying roads in various locations in the Public Concession, such as the section of Nanjing Road from the east end of the Dasing intersection and Yong'an Company's main entrance to Jiujiang Road, and various locations on Fuzhou Road, Hankou Road, and Guangdong Road (i.e., Wuma Road), are the lowest-lying. During every high tide, sewer water inevitably flows back onto the land, even turning into rivers. The Concession authorities have taken note of this and are specifically raising the low-lying roads to prevent contingencies.

<h3>Fruit Shop Accountant Accuses Concubine of Financial Fraud</h3>
<p>Lu Guoqin from Chongming, 21 years old, worked as an accountant at a certain fruit shop at 1272 at the intersection of Lafayette Road and Ladu Road in the French Concession. A local woman named Mali, in her thirties, resided on the upper floor of the Shatetai Coal Shop at 1296 Lafayette Road. She was proficient in both Chinese and Western languages and was also beautiful. She was truly a modern woman of talent and beauty. She had previously worked as a teacher. She often went to Lu's fruit shop to shop and became acquainted with Lu. Although Lu was ordinary in appearance, the two progressed from friendship to love and rented a house at 46, Lane 550, Albert Road, where they lived together in love for two months. After two months, their relationship broke down, and Lu disappeared and no longer stayed overnight at the woman's place. Recently, Lu hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Mali of intimidation and financial fraud. Mali knew that the plaintiff was wealthy and seduced him to live together. After two months, the money had been squandered, and he was regarded as a thorn in her side.

<h3>The Palace Museum Theft Case: Thorough Investigation Begins in Shanghai; Jiangning District Court Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Establish a Temporary Office for Liaison</h3>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Decides to Restore Sichuan Shipping and Rebuild the Emei Steamer</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Sichuan River steamer "Emei" has a deadweight of 1077 tons, a registered tonnage of 565 tons, a length of 193.7 feet, a width of 31 feet, a full load draft of 8 feet, and an empty ship draft of only 5.8 feet. It can be called the premier ship on the route from Shanghai to Chongqing. Since July 26, 1933, it ran aground on Huatanzi shoal downstream of Fuzhou.</p>
<p>After striking a reef and sinking, it cost more than 110,000 yuan and took four months to repair the bottom of the ship and blast away the reef. The ship was then salvaged, but seven of the ship's eight compartments were damaged, namely the boiler room compartment, two forward compartments, two aft compartments, the fire room, and the bow compartment. The decks were completely destroyed. It was not until May 9, 1934, that the ship sailed to Yichang for minor repairs and then returned to Shanghai. Because the hull was completely damaged, only the engine</p>
<p>machinery was intact, so the insurance company paid out as a total loss. After the company inspected the hull, it was determined that if it were to be repaired and put back into service, the entire hull would have to be rebuilt, which would cost several hundred thousand yuan, which was too much. Therefore, it was temporarily shelved and moored in Shanghai. The company's Sichuan River shipping line has been suspended for three years and two months. In recent years, the Sichuan River shipping industry has flourished, and freight rates to Chongqing have continued to soar. The rise of the Minsheng Company and the improvement of British and Japanese Sichuan steamers have all made the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company feel the hidden pain of losses in the Sichuan shipping business. In the spring of this year, the company decided to replace the hull of the Emei steamer</p>
<p>and build a new hull, which was estimated to cost 400,000 yuan. However, due to funding issues, it was not implemented. Recently, Zeng Guangqing, the head of the business department, keenly felt that the Sichuan River business was developing rapidly and deeply regretted the outflow of benefits. He strongly urged the ship department to rush to repair the Emei to meet urgent needs. At first, the company hesitated, but the Sanbei Company recently expressed to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that it was willing to invest in purchasing the Emei steamer, repairing it, and putting it back into service on the Sichuan River. They even requested to see the ship's blueprints. Upon receiving this news, Zeng Guangqing informed the ship department that it was decided not to sell the ship but to repair it on its own. The original plan of spending a huge sum of 400,000 yuan to replace the hull and repair the engine and other items will be implemented soon. It is now in the planning stage. According to insiders at the company, the repair work will take several months, and it is expected that the Sichuan River shipping business will be restored during the flood season next spring. As for the proposal to temporarily use the Lijie tugboat to operate on the Sichuan River, it is feared that the cost would be too high and the benefits would not be worth the effort.</p>

<h3>Notice from the Silk and Satin Industry: Safeguarding Legitimate Goods, Preventing Smuggled Goods Thoroughly, and Extending Inventory Registration to the 20th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association issued a notice stating that the inventory registration of all members of the association has been largely completed. However, as the registration deadline has long passed, it is feared that some non-member colleagues and those who are unaware of the situation have not yet listed and registered their original inventory, which will inevitably hinder the movement. In order to safeguard the normal goods of the industry and prevent the encroachment of smuggled goods, the association strives for thoroughness. At the 18th Standing Committee meeting held on the 11th of this month, it was decided to extend the inventory registration deadline to the 20th of this month. All colleagues, whether or not they are members, must apply for registration of their original inventory within the time limit. If problems occur after this deadline, they will be solely responsible, and the association will not be able to provide protection.</p>

<h3>Committee for Civilian Welfare Undertakings Plans to Build Type C Civilian Village; Model Design Now Complete; Affordable Construction Costs at Selected Site</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, after the Committee for Civilian Welfare Undertakings of this city built Type A and Type B civilian villages in four locations: Zhongshan Road, Qimei Road, Pushan Road, and Damuqiao Road, the population of each village has reached more than 5,900 people. However, compared with the total population of more than 3 million in the city, shop employees, factory workers, rickshaw pullers, dock workers, and other coolies, who account for more than half of the population, are still extremely few. Recently, in order to enable farmers who have migrated to the city to make progress in their lives, economy, and education, it has been decided to build a large number of Type C civilian new villages. The cost of this type of new village will be more affordable than Type A and Type B, with monthly rent not exceeding two yuan. Even those with an income of around ten yuan can afford to live there. The committee has now planned to complete the model setting of the Type C civilian village and will start construction as soon as the site is selected. The construction cost per room is about one hundred yuan. Bamboo and wood will be used for the construction of the walls, and the style will be exactly the same as Type A and Type B. It has been decided to start construction this year.</p>

<h3>Where Do Husbands Who Do Not Satisfy Their Wives Go!</h3>
<p>……Men suffering from premature ejaculation and impotence can never explore the true meaning of sexual life……The treatment methods for reproductive organ dysfunction and gonadal endocrine factors</p>
<p>Tearing off the mask of hypocrisy and putting on a stern face to say: Although the union of husband and wife is ostensibly for the purpose of propagating the race, if we analyze it carefully, I am afraid that trying the true pleasure in desire is a more real comedy! How many of them can truly consider the future of national welfare? Indeed, in this Chinese youth who are barely surviving with a super-mortality rate, how many couples can truly enjoy the happiness of a healthy sexual life! Moreover, the number of people suffering from sexual organ dysfunction actually exceeds general expectations. There are an unusually large number of male and female patients. Can this benefit society?</p>
<p>However, among male sexual dysfunction disorders, the most important are premature ejaculation, seminal emission, nocturnal emission, or impotence. Before studying the cause, it is necessary to consider the constitution first!</p>
<p>Men suffering from this type of disease are mostly those with a nervous constitution or even a thymus lymphatic constitution. In addition to this, there are acquired causes, such as excessive masturbation in adolescence, or after suffering from venereal diseases, or secondary symptoms of neurasthenia, and winter suffering from this disease. Although there are differences in the degree of severity, most are combined with neurasthenia of the brain nerves and reproductive organ nerves, as well as accompanying weakness and hyperesthesia.</p>
<p>The first harm of this disease is that it completely damages the enthusiasm between husband and wife, and even plunges the other party into waves of annoyance, and the happiness between families is completely lost! Therefore, men with seminal emission, premature ejaculation, and impotence, if they do not find a way to cure them, it is not presumptuous to say that even if they live to be a hundred years old, they will not be able to explore the true meaning of sexual life. The happiness of health will naturally never be achieved, so one very important thing is to seek treatment quickly. Regarding the treatment method, according to the research of Dr. Hitchmaunand Adler of the University of Vienna in 1913, and Dr. R. Schrlder in 1915, it has been completely confirmed that gonadal endocrine preparations can indeed enhance the performance between men and women and promote the development of reproductive organs. This knowledge caused a sensation in the medical community in Europe and the United States. Later, Austrian physiologist Dr. Stenach studied and matured it, extracting the gonadal hormones of strong animals and making "Gonadotropin" to treat premature ejaculation and impotence in men, with remarkable effects. If they also suffer from seminal emission, they can be treated with "Hemitol Solidifying Pills," and they will recover in a short time. These two drugs have been praised all over the world and are worth introducing.</p>
<p>Health Broadcasting Station</p>
<h3>Innovation in the Treatment of Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The most important sentence: For those who are addicted to the evils of masturbation, we should not make useless condemnations, but we should study effective methods to reduce this evil. Some people only hear that anyone, especially newly adults, can become victims of masturbation habits, and they feel serious fear in their hearts, but this fear does not help the patient.</p>
<p>We have long known that young people at the time of maturity are almost willing to be manipulated by the evil habit of masturbation, and that the tendency to masturbate during this period feels more so than at other times. Therefore, during this period, the bad influence of masturbation is naturally the most severe. It can damage the sperm ducts and destroy sexual power, and it can also harm the entire body.</p>
<p>The most obvious symptom, as everyone knows, is seminal emission. Seminal emission can cause the body's nutrition to fade, development to be hindered, and neurasthenia to be deepened. If it lasts for too long, it will turn into spermatorrhea, and the nervous system will be harmed beyond repair.</p>
<p>Those who commit the evil habit of masturbation that cannot be eradicated can use hypnosis and give suggestions - this is the most effective method. Regarding seminal emission and spermatorrhea, it is necessary to consolidate the sperm ducts, strengthen the will, reduce nightmares, and invigorate the spirit. Therefore, Berillon, Flerre, and Attlestrand have all unanimously praised "Hemitol Solidifying Pills" as a special medicine for seminal emission. The three are all medical experts of the League of Nations. As for neurasthenia and underdevelopment caused by seminal emission, the gonadal hormone endocrine preparation "Gonadotropin" can be taken, which will show good results.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Effective Smoking Cessation Methods (1)</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Because opium has a strong anesthetic effect, the degree of poisoning of the human body is profound. Once you seek to quit, it is really difficult. Let alone wanting to achieve the goal of quitting the weakened addiction in a short period of time without any discomfort! This physician has insight into the principles of smoking cessation, so I have specially compiled a record of safe smoking cessation practices for readers. The following are all written records of those who have freed themselves from the black sea of ​​addiction. If you use them as a reference before quitting, you will definitely get unlimited practical benefits. I hope readers will not take it lightly.</p>
<p>—The process of quitting smoking with multiple diseases—</p>
<p>The patient is from Wuxi, 39 years old</p>
<p>Works as a factory manager in a silk factory and has to work 12 hours a day without any chance to sit down and rest. His body is extremely exhausted, so he uses opium to stimulate it, and then becomes addicted. For four years, the amount of smoking has increased without decreasing. At the same time, he has headaches, constipation, asthma, tinnitus, and a great decline in his mental state. He is really unable to continue his work, so he is fired by the factory. For the sake of his future, he began to quit smoking. After 39 days, he completely quit the addiction. The above-mentioned diseases disappeared at the same time, his spirit was strong, and his physical strength increased. His method of quitting smoking was to take "Gonadotropin," a genuine gonadal hormone preparation, and inject "Yuweici Life-Saving" (Yuweici Baoming). The amount of smoking gradually decreased automatically, and there was absolutely no pain during the process. Opium was completely eliminated after 35 days. The medication was taken for 39 days before it was declared safe and successful.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea self-healing</p>
<h3>Manipulating Effective Treatments for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>The earlier one seeks medical attention for a disease, the greater the hope of a speedy recovery. This is common knowledge that most patients possess. However, it is particularly crucial for gonorrhea. If gonorrhea is treated appropriately and reasonably in its early stages, there is little risk of it spreading to the posterior urethra and causing complications. Therefore, anyone who frequents prostitutes should undergo thorough weekly check-ups to observe for any symptoms. Although the above method is necessary, patients are often limited by their circumstances and it is not widely practiced. Thus, the most simple, effective, and reliable method is to immediately take "Antirrhea," a compound of yellow pigment and vaccine, at the first sign of suspicion or during the acute phase of gonorrhea. All pain will immediately be alleviated, and the discharge will stop. The invention of such a special remedy for gonorrhea is the result of Dr. Jadassohn's twenty-three years of dedicated research in Germany. It not only has the power to penetrate membranes and kill bacteria, but also produces countless gonorrhea-resistant germs in the patient's body after consumption. Whether it is chronic gonorrhea of many years or complications of gonorrhea such as orchitis, urethritis, arthritis, or prostatitis, the medicine works wonders and eliminates the disease. Because of its great effectiveness, patients find its use very convenient. For example, a patient named Wei Yongkang, 27 years old, from Hangzhou, suffered from an unusually severe case of gonorrhea. It lingered for three years, causing him great suffering. Due to improper medication, it almost became a chronic gonorrhea that would never heal. His semen was severely damaged, his face looked haggard, and his muscles were thin. In June of this year, he was introduced by a friend to take "Antirrhea." In less than two months, the discharge stopped, his urine became clear, and the disease was completely cured. At the same time, because his body had suffered too much damage, he took "Germinal Extract" to cure his premature aging and kidney atrophy. It has been four months since then, and he is full of energy, his complexion is rosy, and his muscles are gradually getting stronger. This misguided young man has been given a new lease on life, which is truly fortunate!</p>

<h3>An Effective Strategy for Rescuing Women with Infertility and Menstrual Disorders</h3>
<p>— Written by German Medical Doctor Y.K., Translated and Edited by Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>A woman's lifelong hope is to be able to have a sweet little baby and become a mother. Losing this advantage is the most devastating disappointment in a woman's life, sometimes leading to family breakdown or constant unhappiness.</p>
<p>Infertility is often caused by problems in the reproductive tracts of men or women. Although male reproductive issues bear a considerable responsibility for infertility, if no cause of infertility can be found in the woman, a thorough examination of the man should be conducted to find the reason for the absence of children.</p>
<p>Infertility is the condition where a woman cannot produce offspring. If conception is impossible, it is considered "absolute infertility." If conception is possible but the fetus dies, it is considered "relative infertility."</p>
<p>There are many conditions that can cause a fetus to die in the womb and not be born alive. Most are due to diseases of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries, but these will not be discussed in this chapter. If a woman cannot conceive, apart from structural abnormalities of the reproductive organs, such as an imperforate hymen, absence of eggs, fallopian tubes, uterus, or even the vulva, the most important cause is gonorrhea. If the husband or wife has gonorrhea, the man's testicles are damaged and the woman's ovaries are destroyed. Often, the man's vas deferens or the woman's fallopian tubes become inflamed, leading to blockage of the man's ejaculation passage and the woman's egg-receiving orifice. In such cases, according to Dr. William Bayless of the Internatina Medical Group, the most famous gonorrhea expert of the League of Nations medical team, "Antirrhea," a compound preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine invented by Dr. Jadassohn, can be taken. (Editor's note: one of the above names is British, the other is German.) It can not only completely cure gonorrhea, but also allow the couple to have healthy children.</p>
<p>In addition, a common cause of infertility in women is menstrual disorders. Amenorrhea and delayed menstruation are clear signs of a woman's loss of health, and the inevitable consequence is infertility. The most reliable treatment is "Female Germinal Extract," a germinal gland extract invented by Austrian physiologist Steinach. It is almost universally praised by physicians around the world as an effective agent for regulating menstruation and strengthening the body. He has received awards from the governments of seven countries, which are of course the most active in encouraging childbirth. Male "Germinal Extract" was also invented by him, and has a remarkable effect on nourishing the human germinal glands. Premature ejaculation and impotence are enemies that deprive men of fertility. It can be completely cured in a very short time. No wonder family planners consider it a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge about Bone Pain</p>
<h3>Special Effectiveness in Overcoming Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The symptoms of bone pain vary depending on the degree of the patient's physical weakness and age. It is more severe in older people than in younger people, worsens in winter compared to the other three seasons, and always intensifies during seasonal transitions. However, it automatically subsides after this period, which is something that most chronically ill people can anticipate. This seasonal bone pain is truly the only difficulty for those who are old and weak. In addition, for young people who suffer from bone pain due to physical weakness, the lower back aches after work, and the pain subsides with rest. If the pain is due to early indulgence and impure blood, the pain feels numb, especially in the joints of the limbs. If not treated properly, it can quickly lead to hemiplegia.</p>
<p>Patient He Mingyou, 52 years old, suffered from generalized pain all over his body, with no relief throughout the year. However, the severity of the pain varied depending on the season and weather. The pain was more severe in damp weather and during seasonal transitions. He had suffered from this condition for twelve years, and repeated treatments were ineffective. This spring, he was introduced by a colleague to purchase "Qiangqi Deng's Bone Pain Pills" from Wing On Company. After taking four boxes in a row, the pain stopped immediately. At the same time, his hands and feet felt light and his joints felt comfortable. It has been four months since then, and he has never felt the slightest bone pain. This is truly a good example for those who have been suffering for a long time.</p>

<p>(1) Frequent Masturbation Depletes Essence and Weakens the Body</p>
<p>Patient Wu Fuqi, 21 years old, from Luodian, works in a bookstore. Because of frequent masturbation in his early years, his neurasthenia has become increasingly severe in recent years. (Complaint) – He has nocturnal emissions at least three times a week, and often five or six times. If he has insomnia at night, he will have spermatorrhea during the day when he is slightly bothered at work. (Medical History) – Wu was poisoned by obscene books in his early years, and contracted the bad habit of self-abuse at the age of 16, resulting in exhaustion of energy, weakened body, forgetfulness, and frequent nocturnal emissions despite his young age. In March of this year, he came for treatment through the introduction of his relative. (Symptoms at the Time of Diagnosis) – Abnormal atrophy of the prostate, small testicles, as well as tinnitus, weak brain, headache, and weak limbs. (Treatment Method) – Cooling method and massage, electrotherapy once a day, and instructed to purchase "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" from Chinese and Western pharmacies to treat his nocturnal emissions, and to take genuine, pure germinal gland extract "Germinal Extract" to replenish essence, strengthen the brain, and cure his neurasthenia. After taking several boxes in a row, the nocturnal emissions stopped early, and he immediately felt more energetic, his essence was sufficient, his brain was nourished, his muscles were developed, his weight increased frequently, and his appetite also increased.

<p>(2) The Harm of Early Marriage Affects Young People</p>
<p>Patient Xu Guoying, from Chaoxian County, Anhui, 21 years old, suffered from the harm of early marriage, growth stopped, and he even suffered from premature ejaculation and impotence, unable to perform the conjugal act. (Chief Complaint) – After graduating from elementary school, he was married off according to his parents' wishes. At this time, he was only 16 years old, and his development was not yet complete. Soon after his wedding night, in less than three months, he suffered from premature ejaculation, impotence, and occasional nocturnal emissions. His body was thin and his face was withered. (Medical History) – Xu was inherently weak and had been sick since childhood. Since he got married at the age of 16, because the other party was an older woman, two years older than Xu, the mismatch in age and the physiological sexual desire caused an imbalance between the two parties, resulting in a big mistake. (Symptoms at the Time of Diagnosis) – Not only premature ejaculation and impotence, but also incomplete development, small genitals and testicles. He also had nocturnal emissions, leading to countless symptoms of neurasthenia. (Treatment Method) – I diagnosed that Xu's germinal glands were declining and his internal secretions were lacking, so I prescribed medication according to the symptoms, and instructed him to purchase "Germinal Extract" from Wing On Company to enhance his performance, help promote metabolism, renew development, and eliminate neurasthenia. At the same time, he was given "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to treat his nocturnal emissions.

<h3>Soccer Is About to Start, Recent News from Various Teams, Qinghua Disbands, Players Reassigned to Jinde, Eastern China's Home Field Changes to City Sports Field</h3>
<p>The sweltering heat has passed and autumn is approaching. The soccer season is already underway. Since the registration deadline for the local four-person soccer league, the annual meeting has also been held as usual. The game schedule is set for the last Saturday of September (i.e., the 26th of this month) according to the rules. The activities of the 41 new and old member teams participating in this year's league are often watched by all Shanghai fans. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>Comparison of Advances and Withdrawals in the Past Two Sessions</p>
<p>The league in the previous session was divided into five groups, with four groups (A, B, C, and D) each consisting of ten teams, and the remaining teams were all placed in Group E, with a total of 18 teams, totaling 58 teams. Due to rain, each group failed to end as scheduled. This year, the old members who withdrew included the Youth Team, which was the runner-up in Group B last year, and the Special Police, Xingguang Acadin, and other three teams in Group D, as well as Weihua, National Goods Bank, Electric Power, Wen, Feigong, and Gonghua, and other six teams in Group E, totaling ten teams who withdrew. The teams in Group A last year continue to participate this year without any changes. The new additions include Jinan, Dongguang, Nie Zhongcheng, Jinde, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the Municipal Council Middle School, and other six teams.</p>
<p>Youthful Athletes Reassigned to Jinde</p>
<p>Among them, the disbandment of the Youth Team, which was the runner-up in Group B last year, is the most regrettable. However, some of the youthful athletes of the Youth Team have been reassigned to Jinde this year, so Jinde's strength this year is particularly noteworthy. In addition to the Youth Team athletes Xu Jingcheng, Gao Xiquan, and Jiang Laichen, Jinde's current main players also include Zhang Jinhai, a "rotating player" from Eastern China last year, further strengthening their strength. It is said that Jinde's chairman, Zhou Wenbin, has requested the Western League authorities to join Group A, but it is unknown whether he can obtain the approval of the Western League Executive Committee, but at least he can often be included in Group B. According to the Jinde Association, it is organized by the employees of the China Bookstore, and non-employees of the bookstore are not allowed to join the team. Zhang Xu and others have recently joined China Bookstore, so they were recruited. It is also said that Luo Douwen has recently been recruited by the association.</p>
<p>Eastern China Changes Venue to City Sports Field</p>
<p>After the news that Eastern China abandoned Shenyuan and changed its home field to the City Sports Field in the previous session due to poor luck in the game, resulting in a third-place finish with ten wins and four losses, it has attracted the attention of soccer fans. Most of Shenyuan's soccer ticket revenue relies on Eastern China's appeal. This year, since the City Sports Field has been changed to the home field, Shenyuan will be greatly affected. However, the details of the issue with Eastern China itself vary, but those involved have kept it a secret.</p>
<p>Jinan Rebuilds, Difficult to Utilize the Talents of Youyou</p>
<p>The Jinan team, which was absent last year for some reason, has rebuilt its team this year and will continue its past dominance. However, most of Jinan's athletes last year were assigned to Youyou, and with the arrival of Xiao Heitan from the north, Youyou was able to overwhelm Eastern China and win the runner-up. Now that Jinan is rebuilding, the athletes who temporarily left last year will naturally return to their mother team to play. Therefore, Youyou feels it is difficult to deploy its lineup. According to someone close to the association, Youyou knows that its talent is weak this year and does not intend to compete in Group A. It will soon apply to the Western League authorities to join Group B to participate in the war, in order to secure the championship. If so, it is also a strategic choice.</p>
<h3>Ten Ping Cup Table Tennis Final, Guangdong Defeats Langya to Win the Championship, 4-3 Tense Situation, The Winner Is Decided in the Seventh Set</h3>
<p>The long-awaited Ten Ping Cup final was held at the Central Auditorium on North Sichuan Road the night before last (the 12th). The bells rang six times, and the audience arrived one after another. At the Yokohama Bridge, the traffic was busy, and there were more than a thousand spectators by seven o'clock. At this time, Li Fengchi, a member of the Mountain Union Committee, reported that Xian Shanqian and Jingwu performed doubles, which was quite exciting. As a result, Shanqian narrowly won by a score of 1. Then, Zhu Kuisheng and Zhu Jianzhang performed three sets of hard ball (world standard). At exactly eight o'clock, the players from the Langya and Guangdong teams entered the arena in uniform. After a brief practice, the referee Chen Linsheng gave an order, and the battle began. Zhu Yongkang, a famous general of Langya, took the field and easily defeated Qu Shangzhi by a score of 3-1. However, Rong Deneng of the second group of Guangdong refused to be outdone and defeated Zou Guofan by a score of 3-0, angering Chen Zhensheng, the captain of the Langya team, who retaliated with a score of 3-0 against Lin Murong. Guangdong then sent the fierce general Ouyang Wei, who defeated Fang Keping by a score of 3-0. The back-and-forth situation was tense and changed rapidly. At this point, the score was tied, and the winner was undecided. The fifth group was Langya's left-handed general Zhang Ying, and Guangdong was the remote famous general Lu Zhongqiu. After the battle, Zhang relied on his skillful serve and won the first set. Lu relied on his rich experience and was careful to respond, and finally won two consecutive sets. At this point, Guangdong reversed the defeat and took the lead. The sixth group was Langya's Lu Hanjun, who was good at both offense and defense, and Guangdong was the rising star Zhang Zhihong. It was expected that Zhang would collapse at the sight of the wind, but who knew that the battle was quite exciting. Lu tried his best and won by a score of 3-2. Therefore, the question of who would win the championship was tied to the outcome of the final seventh group. Unexpectedly, after the start of the game, Langya's Le Junchang failed miserably and lost to Guangdong's new general Zhou Ziming by a score of 0-3. Guangdong became the champion of the Ten Ping Cup. Wang Bohong, the consultant of the National Table Tennis Association, gave a speech and awarded the prizes. Xu Chongye, the representative of the Guangdong team, smiled and took the cup away.</p>

Although the people were young and the ball skills were quite proficient, the strength was insufficient, but the spirit was quite full. They galloped across the field, shooting with a slight formation, which was a different scene. It was truly worth watching.</p>
<p>Also, in the warrior group, when Kaiwen B was playing against Xiyao Zuo, Kaiwen was winning, but the team member Zhang Guanjin's actions were unusually barbaric and he was sent off by the referee. It was found that Zhang Guanjin had previously been repeatedly warned for his rude behavior and was suspended from the industrial and commercial soccer game for one year. Now he has relapsed, which is a pity. It is heard that if he commits another offense in the future, the association will give him the most severe punishment.</p>
<p>Also, in the youth group, in the game between Yuqing Jia and Beiqing, Beiqing won by a score of 1-1, but some players did not go through the weighing procedure, and their height exceeded the prescribed limit. According to the rules, even if they win, they will be considered to have lost.</p>

<h3>Central China Youth National Martial Arts Group Recruits New Members</h3>
<p>The annual meeting of the Chinese Youth Association National Martial Arts Group at Baxianqiao was held last month. The new officials for this session have also been selected. In order to promote national martial arts, the group specifically set aside time to recruit new comrades starting last month. However, because it was during the summer vacation, most of the members were on summer vacation in other places, so those who responded to the recruitment were not very enthusiastic. After discussion by the officials of the group, it was decided to postpone the recruitment period by one month, until the end of this month, in order to attract more new comrades to participate. During this period, you can still register to participate, and there will be no further extensions.</p>

<h3>Account of the World Games Athlete Delegation's Journey (Letter No. 13) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>The two sides' cheering squads watched from across the field, engaging in a fierce war of words, using witty and humorous taunts, but the eagerness to win often led to disputes. Erickson committed a foul, Knowles's aim was off, and Bayden's throws under the basket bounced off the rim. At twelve minutes, Graythol finally scored one point for the American team through a free throw. Forndenbury then had two free throw opportunities but missed both. Fortunately, his passing was effective, allowing Le Grand to easily score. Near the end of the game, Chapman was penalized for charging, and Fordenbury scored with a hand-through-the-net shot. Each team scored four points in the second half, demonstrating the intensity of the match. The final score was 19-8, with the Canadian team losing.</p>

<p>(6) (2) Record of the Football Final: Italy Wins Championship, Austria Runner-up, Norway Third, Poland Fourth</p>
<p>The tournament had sixteen participating countries and used a knockout system. The first-week matches started on the 3rd and ended on the 6th. The eight winning teams held the second-week matches on the 7th and 8th. As a result, Norway, Italy, Austria, and Poland qualified for the semi-finals. The matches after the semi-finals were all held in the main stadium, which was covered with green grass and was very flat. Around the field, forty children sat to retrieve the balls, preventing delays. The facilities were very complete. For each match, there were over 100,000 spectators, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. In the semi-final match between Italy and Norway on the 10th, the score was tied 1-1 after ninety minutes. Italy scored in extra time, winning the right to the final. In the semi-final match between Austria and Poland on the 11th, Austria won 3-1. Italy and Austria held the championship match on the afternoon of the 15th, amidst cheers from 110,000 spectators. Italy won by scoring a goal in extra time, defeating Austria 2-1 and winning the tournament championship, while Austria took second place. Norway and Poland competed for third and fourth place on the afternoon of the 13th, with Norway eventually winning 3-2. (Uruguay and Argentina, who won the championship and runner-up titles in the 1928 Ninth Games, were regrettably absent this year. The German team, which was expected to win the championship, and the English team, the originators of football, were both unexpectedly eliminated in the third round by strong opponents. Japan's victory in the first week was also unexpected. Our team's unfortunate encounter with England in the first match was truly unlucky.)</p>
<p>Italy's victory was entirely due to their spirit of perseverance and superb football skills, and was by no means a fluke. However, the players were too concerned about winning and losing, and their actions were sometimes rough, which somewhat tarnished their reputation.</p>
<p>The player whose individual skills were most admired was undoubtedly Kappel, the Austrian goalkeeper. His techniques of catching, blocking, and diving were truly supernatural, and his courageous spirit of putting life and death aside when saving the ball was unparalleled. Experts said that if a global team were to be formed to compete against other planets, while there might be difficulties in choosing other positions, this man would undoubtedly be the goalkeeper. His skills are admired to such an extent. The complete results of the football tournament are listed below:</p>
<p>(Note) Peru originally defeated Austria 4-2, but Austria protested to the organizing committee due to unfair refereeing and requested a rematch. The organizing committee accepted the request, but Peru refused to replay, so they were judged to have forfeited, and Austria was awarded the victory.</p>
<p>Italy-Austria Final: First Half 0-0, Second Half 1-1, Extra Time 1-0, Result 2-1, Italy Wins</p>
<p>The Italy-Austria championship match at 4:00 PM on the 15th caused a sensation among football fans throughout Berlin. The stands around the stadium were packed with spectators, and there was not a single space to be found. According to the ticket office statistics, there were more than 110,000 people. However, there were also several thousand people outside the stadium who could not buy tickets, listening to the broadcast report and the cheers from inside to get their fill. This state of fanaticism and enthusiasm was even more intense than the situation during our country's National Games football competition last year.</p>
<p>During the 120-minute fierce battle, the players on both sides were living in a storm of suspense at all times. There was truly not a single minute that was not tense, not a single second that was not intense, which excited the hundred thousand fans to the point of losing control. It is unknown how many people shouted themselves hoarse. The German people naturally cheered for Austria, but the Italian cheering squad was diverse and powerful, also adding much excitement to the match.</p>
<p>At 4:00, the referee called the two team captains to toss a coin to determine positions. Italy faced east against the sun, taking advantage of the weather conditions. At 4:05, the battle began with the Austrian team taking the offensive. The two teams' lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Venturini</p>
<p>Rava, Foni</p>
<p>Locatelli, Piccini, Baldo</p>
<p>Gabriotti, Bachi, Bertoni, Meazza, Frossi</p>
<p>Austria</p>
<p>Kappel</p>
<p>Kargl, Kuntze</p>
<p>Hummerstofer, Wahlmüller, Kroun</p>
<p>Fuchsberger, Kappel, Steinmetz, Laudon, Werginz</p>
<p>Referee: Dr. Bauwens (Germany), Linesmen: Olsson (Sweden), Hertzka (Hungary)</p>
<p>Storm of Attacks, But No Goals</p>
<p>As soon as the referee blew the whistle, the Austrian army immediately launched an attack. As soon as the ball reached the midfield line it was intercepted. The Italians launched a counter-attack but were also blocked. Although the front lines on both sides were extremely sharp and agile, it was difficult to break through the final line of defence due to the tight defences. Even if there was a shot it was saved by the goalkeeper. After 15 minutes of fierce fighting the Italian forward broke through the Austrian midfield and Gabriotti on the left wing sprinted forward with unmatched speed. Kroun chased desperately but was unable to catch up. Gabriotti passed the ball perfectly but Kappel rushed out to intercept. Bertoni volleyed the ball straight toward the Austrian goal. Everyone thought it would be a goal but Kuntze ran back and deflected the ball with his leg. At twenty minutes the Austrian army also copied an attack from the left and Fuchsberger passed to the middle to Steinmetz at a good spot who fired a shot from 15 yards. Venturini rushed out but was out of position and the goal was wide open. However, the ball was half an inch too high and went over the bar. At thirty minutes the Austrian army attacked again. Steinmetz and Fuchsberger passed to each other perfectly and approached the Italian goal. Fuchsberger crossed the ball high and Steinmetz headed it but it was still a bit too high and out. The entire crowd sighed for it. The Italian army kicked the ball forward and Bachi fired a hard shot from 20 yards out. Kappel dove to save it. The crowd cheered and thundered in admiration. At 37 minutes the Austrian army continued to press forward and Laudon shot but Venturini punched it away. Steinmetz kicked it again but Rava cleared it. The Austrian army continued to attack. However, the Italian defence was like a wall so they could not get their way. At 44 minutes the Austrian forwards were attacking inside the Italian defence at 8 yards out. The Italian soldiers didn't give in lightly and retreated. The first half ended and there were no records.</p>
<p>Each Side Scores After Great Hardship</p>
<p>After lemon, they changed sides and fought again. Both sides were eager to win so the fighting was rough. Italy was penalized and booed often. After three minutes they copied an attack on the left and crossed. The right inside forward Meazza was late by one step. The Austrian army attacked twice and Laudon and Steinmetz shot but it was cleared by Venturini. At ten minutes the Italian line rushed forward. Meazza took a hard shot from 20 yards out but Kappel blocked it. Two minutes later Bertoni lead the generals forward. At thirty yards he passed the defender and Meazza and Frossi charged forward. Kappel rushed out and kicked it away. After 15 minutes Kroun was injured and returned in 3 minutes. At 19 minutes the Italian army arrived again. Bertoni's shot was blocked and he passed to the left. Gabriotti fell and passed to Bertoni who shot it. The Italian army continued the attack and there were many dangerous situations for the Austrian defence. At 21 minutes Bertoni shot at 20 yards out but Kappel saved it. The Austrian army copied. Steinmetz shot from 30 yards out and Venturini caught it but the ball dropped from his hands. Bertoni intercepted and sprinted forward. Wahlmüller gave chase. Bertoni passed to Meazza at 15 yards and Meazza shot. Kappel dove and saved it. Frossi shot and scored for Italy. After 24 minutes the Austrian army tried to attack. However, Rava and Foni defended well. Kappel continued to save the ball and the opportunity to score became a pie in the sky. At 36 minutes Laudon shot from 30 yards. Venturini didn't pay attention and the ball went into the net. The audience cheered. At 43 minutes Kargl shot from the half way line toward the front of the gate.</p>
<p>In the end, after 90 minutes, each side managed to score a goal amidst great hardship, resulting in a tie.</p>
<p>Italy Wins in Extra Time</p>
<p>Since a tie had been reached, 10 minutes of extra time were given to determine the final victor. The two teams were strong and energetic and showed no signs of fatigue. The Austrian team launched the initial attack, advancing into the Italian midfield, where Piccini intercepted the ball and passed it to the right. Frossi received the ball and sprinted forward like an angry horse, with Hummerstofer chasing closely behind. As Frossi approached the Austrian baseline, he passed the ball towards the center. Kutschi quickly blocked it, but in a hurried moment, he misjudged the direction and kicked the ball towards Gabriotti's feet. Without hesitation, Gabriotti passed the ball again towards the goal. Frossi arrived like lightning, awaiting the opportunity. From five yards in front of the goal, he gently flicked the ball, and even Kappel, with his extraordinary abilities, could only watch helplessly as the ball went in. This goal, scored just two minutes into extra time, marked Frossi's second contribution, and the Italian team celebrated him like a god. Although the Austrian team was caught off guard, their determination did not waver. The forward line and defenders worked together, launching an all-out attack. The Italian team also retreated to defend their own territory. After five minutes, the Austrian team launched a relentless attack on the goal, firing shots like raindrops, but the Italian defense held firm and blocked each attempt. After six minutes, the Austrian team launched another attack. Steinmetz feinted past Piccini and passed the ball to the right. Fuchsberger rushed forward to attack, but his shot was slightly wide of the goal. By now, the Austrian team had already planted the seeds of defeat. In the 14th minute, Locatelli committed a foul, and Wahlmüller took the resulting free kick from 40 yards. The ball landed perfectly, but Fuchsberger was a step too slow and Venturini intercepted it first. In the first fifteen minutes of extra time, the Italian team had a one-goal lead. As the sides switched again to continue the battle, the Austrian team continued to strive for a counterattack, while the Italian team focused on defense, with no further ambitions. All eleven players remained within their own territory, closely guarding against any threats. The Austrian team, with the exception of the goalkeeper, all moved forward to support the attack, creating a powerful and overwhelming force, and the shouts from the crowd created a scene reminiscent of a battlefield. As the end of the match approached, the Austrian team intensified their attack, launching three consecutive shots from the forward line, but each one was blocked by the two generals, Rava and Foni, creating tense and dangerous moments. In the closing moments of the match, Laudon took a free kick from 20 yards to the right of the goal after an Italian foul. The left inside forward Kappel leaped up to head the ball, but it was slightly high and went over the crossbar. As the final whistle blew, the Austrian team retreated in disappointment, while the Italian team cheered in victory.</p>

<h3>THE GAINS AND LOSSES OF IMPLEMENTING CONSUMPTION TAX IN HEBEI AND CHAHAR</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingshi</p>
<p>In recent years, China's industry and commerce have been continuously subjected to turmoil, with no room to breathe. Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast market was seized, followed by the global economic downturn. Furthermore, frequent droughts and floods in the domestic rural areas have made it even more difficult for industry and commerce. Starting in the second half of the previous year, the U.S. silver policy led to financial tightening, and the massive smuggling that began in August delivered a fatal blow to industry and commerce. However, the panic of financial tightening was eventually overcome by the government's resolute currency reform and effective relief from various parties. Although smuggling was rampant for a long time, it has recently shown signs of abating due to the efforts of anti-smuggling and the passive resistance of various parties. The recovery of domestic economic strength naturally lies in its own hard work and struggle to achieve the hope of survival. However, the reality and the environment are not so simple. Recently, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council plans to establish inspection offices in eight locations, including Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Cangzhou, Boutou Town, and Qikou, to levy a consumption tax equivalent to one-eighth of the regular customs duty on goods imported from the Hebei Eastern puppet regime area, allowing free transportation within the Hebei and Chahar provinces and the two cities of Beiping and Tianjin. Although industrial and commercial circles have telegraphed to inquire about the truth, the authorities only defended that the establishment of the inspection office is to adjust the interests of legitimate merchants. If the above news becomes a reality, the damage caused thereafter will be even greater than smuggling, and the reasons for the defense are even more untenable!</p>
<p>Originally, smuggling mostly occurs due to the increase in tariffs. China has revised tariffs seven times between the 18th year and the following six years, purely to protect domestic industries. However, smuggling has gradually occurred with it, which is an inevitable fact. Judging from the past few years, such as after the entire tax rate was increased in the 22nd year, the import volume of the six ports in North China was still 204,676 thousand yuan at that time. After the tax rate was raised twice in the 20th year, it decreased to 161,776 thousand yuan. Last year, it decreased again to 150,133 thousand yuan. Comparing the import volume of the six ports in North China in the first six months of this year with the same period last year:</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, the import volume of the six ports in North China this year has changed from a deficit of more than 12.3 million yuan last year to a surplus of more than 44.9 million yuan. This reverse in surplus is the result of smuggling causing a reduction in legitimate imports.</p>
<p>And this time, smuggling, in practical terms, goes beyond ordinary smuggling. Because the causes of smuggling are, first, economic reasons. The purpose of smuggling is to seek profit. If the tariff is heavier, the profit is greater, which is inevitable. However, reducing tariffs or levying other taxes will not absolutely eliminate smuggling. Second, geographical reasons. Any country with vast land borders or long coastlines, and proximity to neighboring countries, can provoke smuggling by unscrupulous merchants. Third, political reasons, mostly due to the imperfection of customs organization and the ineffectiveness of anti-smuggling. But this smuggling, in nature, has armed forces as its backing and is completely manipulated by foreign forces. In form, it is openly transported and is a public action. The purpose of this smuggling is nothing more than to use this action to coerce China's finances into a predicament. Economically, it leaves China's industry permanently in a colonial stage, with no way forward. Its intentions are so deeply poisonous. If the Hebei-Chahar Political Council implements a consumption tax as a substitute for customs duties, it is precisely what it wants and is being subdued by it. This is not feasible, one.</p>
<p>Customs duties account for 90 percent of China's tax revenue, and import duties account for more than 80 percent of the total. Import duties are a crucial part of China's fiscal revenue. During the past smuggling period, the tax losses from artificial silk, white sugar, and cigarette paper alone from January 24th to May 25th were already considerable, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>In the past ten months, the above three smuggled goods have resulted in a tax loss of about 34 million yuan. According to customs reports, the loss reached 8 million yuan in April alone. If calculated according to this, the annual loss would be 100 million yuan, equivalent to one-third of the total tax revenue. Furthermore, the consolidated tax is also reduced due to smuggling. According to reports, the cotton yarn consolidated tax in Tianjin and Beiping in March of this year was still 67,467 yuan, decreasing to 49,859 yuan in April and 46,251 yuan in May. The cigarette tax also decreased from 42,272 yuan in March to 39,680 yuan in April and 32,032 yuan in May. Now, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council only levies a consumption tax at one-eighth of the customs duty. In the future, imported goods will definitely be transported in and out of Tianjin and Beiping due to the huge profits. Will the national import tax be entirely turned into smuggled goods at one-eighth the rate? If calculated based on this year's estimated customs revenue of 317,973,514 yuan, wouldn't it immediately drop to 40 to 50 million yuan? The reason for the impropriety of this measure lies in this, two.</p>
<p>Since China's tariff autonomy, the revision of tariffs has been carefully and thoroughly considered. On the one hand, it takes into account the trade of various countries, and on the other hand, it protects the development of domestic industries. The revision of tax rates is never done rashly. Therefore, China's highest ad valorem tax is only 80 percent. The ad valorem taxes of European and American powers are as high as 200 percent, so China's tax rates are not high. The specific taxes are also lower than those of other countries. Take the most smuggled goods, artificial silk and sugar, as an example. According to customs reports, the highest import tax rate for white sugar in China is 9.6 gold units per 100 kilograms. Germany is 32 marks, equivalent to 19 gold units. The United Kingdom is equivalent to 13.2 gold units. France is equivalent to 33.3 gold units. Japan is 14.6 Japanese yen per 100 kilograms, equivalent to 10.71 gold units (referring to the devalued Japanese yen; when it was not devalued, it was equivalent to 30.93 gold units). Another example is artificial silk, where China charges 120 gold units per 100 kilograms. Germany is equivalent to 131 gold units. The United Kingdom is equivalent to 101.6 gold units. The United States is equivalent to more than 147 units. France is more than 159.16 units. Japan, calculated at the current exchange rate, is equivalent to 72.82 gold units; if calculated at the pre-devaluation rate, it would be 210 gold units. Based on this, China's tax rates are not higher than those of other countries. The smugglers' accusation that tariffs are too high has other motives, and reducing tax rates cannot satisfy their desires. Moreover, the profits from smuggling will never be unprofitable due to tax reductions, unless it is tax-free! Therefore, whether tax is reduced or not, it is clear that smuggling is difficult to eliminate. Does the Hebei-Chahar Political Council's levying of consumption tax constitute a tax reduction? If this is the case, it will not only not help smuggling but also self-destruct the national administrative organization and damage national finances. This is not feasible, three.</p>
<p>China's industry has not yet reached its prosperous era. Moreover, it is subject to the dumping of foreign goods and the competition of domestic and foreign factories, which is already exhausting. Commercial capital is also extremely weak. Once subjected to unexpected damage, collapse is imminent. Judging from past records of the impact of smuggling, such as the sugar industry, more than 120 sugar firms in Shanghai and Beiping are about to shut down entirely due to the pressure of smuggled sugar, and no one cares about domestically produced sugar, which has also led to the successive closure of sugar factories in Guangdong. The flour industry mostly targets the North China market. Recently, due to the import of smuggled flour into North China, stocks are accumulating in various ports, and flour prices have plummeted. Flour factories have once stopped work to reduce output in order to maintain their capital. The cigarette industry has also shut down 16 factories due to smuggling. The largest national industry, the textile mill, initially turned to weaving due to sluggish yarn sales, but the smuggled piece goods in North China continued to flow in, and most of the popular blue cloth and twill in rural areas were captured by it. Therefore, the textile industry in North China has been the hardest hit, and major yarn mills have successively fallen into the hands of foreign merchants. The number of spindles shut down by textile mills across the country in half a year is also greater than in the past. For example, in the first half of the 24th year, it was 1,344,986 spindles, 1,360,273 spindles in the second half, and increased to 1,555,014 spindles in the first half of this year. The silk industry has suffered greatly since the replacement of silk fabrics by artificial silk in previous years. The harm of invasion by smuggled goods is even more severe. According to artificial silk, after the Hebei Eastern puppet regime established offices in Qinhuangdao, Nandasi, Beidaihe, Liushou Island, and Changli on March 1, smuggled goods are generally taxed at one-fifth to one-sixth of the national tariff rate. Therefore, the import of artificial silk, which previously required a tax of 220 yuan per 200-pound box, can now pass for only 40 yuan, a reduction of 180 yuan compared to before. Due to the convenience of the pass-through tax, the selling price of bleached foreign cloth has also fallen by 3 yuan per piece. One hundred catties of sugar is also 7.5 yuan cheaper than legitimate sugar. Recently, the Shanghai electric silk weaving industry discovered smuggled silk being sold in Shanghai and requested the municipal chamber of commerce to find a solution. It is said that 5,000 to 6,000 pieces arrive in Shanghai every day, and the source is Zhoucun, Shandong. The selling price of Minghua crepe is only equal to the cost of domestically produced products of the same raw materials in this city. The selling price of Zhongshan tweed is only 4 yuan. If customs tax is levied on equivalent artificial silk, it would cost 4.2 yuan, which is not enough to cover the tax. From the above, it can be seen that legitimate industry and commerce are absolutely unable to compete with it.</p>
<p>The foundation of China's industry and commerce is very shallow, as mentioned earlier. Now, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, without looking ahead and behind, has taken this light-hearted action, which is tantamount to accelerating the speed of the total collapse of domestic industries. Based on this, the inspection office and consumption tax should not exist, four.</p>
<p>The four points mentioned above are only the most obvious, sufficient to prove that the Hebei-Chahar Political Council's establishment of the General Inspection Office is completely lacking in thorough evaluation. According to the Central News Agency's dispatch from Beiping on the 7th, the defense is that "Recently, smuggled goods are rampant, and the market has been greatly affected. After several discussions, it is believed that while anti-smuggling should be carried out vigorously, smuggled goods that evade taxes should not be allowed to be sold freely. In order to take into account both circumstances and environment, a General Inspection Office has been established to make up for the deficiency. Its duty is only to inspect smuggled goods that have already landed, and there is no conflict with the customs. After anti-smuggling has a proper solution, smuggled goods will not be able to land, and the office will naturally not need to exist. Therefore, the establishment of the office does not create a new tax system." Based on this, the establishment of the General Inspection Office seems to be assisting the customs in its lack of anti-smuggling capabilities. If this is the case, it is naturally welcomed by the people of the country. However, its duty is to handle smuggled goods that have already landed and impose penalties on smuggled goods, but it does not hand over the smuggled goods and witnesses to the customs for handling, or confiscate all smuggled goods, or order them to make up for the tax. This is clearly another organization, which does not assist the customs in any way, and clearly divides the boundaries with the customs! Originally, when the customs encounters difficulties in anti-smuggling at sea, it can still exercise its powers on land. Now, with this kind of organization, it adds a kind of guarantee to smuggled goods! Moreover, judging from past facts, the source of smuggled goods is mostly from Hebei Eastern via the Beining Railway to Tianjin, all within the scope of land routes, and the customs has no way to intervene. Where does the proper solution start? There is no doubt that the General Inspection Office will exist relatively. It is further said that smuggled goods that evade taxes should not be allowed to be sold freely. The content is naturally the levying of consumption tax. Once smugglers pay the tax, they can naturally travel unhindered. In this way, legitimate goods will be completely usurped by lightly taxed goods. What is the meaning of "adjusting" and "maintaining" legitimate merchants?</p>
<p>In summary, it not only harms fiscal revenue and undermines customs administration, but also can quickly cause the industry and commerce of North China to fall into a state of irreversible doom. Even the industry and commerce of the whole country feel a great threat and cannot maintain it!</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>The sugar inventory in this city has slightly decreased (as of September 13th)</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Cloth sales exceed production. American cotton spot sales are excellent. Yesterday, American cotton opened with gains and losses of 2 points per month. Liverpool news was good, but it was overturned by hedging. The amount sold was immediately absorbed. Foreign merchants and Bombay firms bought in, and prices rose again. There were limited new accounts. Most of the transactions were among industry insiders. Current cotton sales are very good, and cloth sales exceed production. The market closed firm. Spot prices remained unchanged. Futures ranged from unchanged to up 7 points. English cotton spot prices rose 8 points, and futures rose 3-4 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by speculators and European exporters, but then weakened due to retail sales and profit-taking by bulls. However, it rose again due to purchases by traders. Plain fruit rose 2 rupees, Omra rose 3.25 rupees, and White Luo Creek rose 3.5 rupees, according to the original telegraphic record (dated 12th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, at the opening on the 14th, White Luo Creek was predicted to be 221.5 rupees, down 0.75 rupees. Omra was 198.5 rupees, down 0.75 rupees. Plain fruit was 159 rupees, down 0.25 rupees.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Sales of narrow strip steel remain strong. Narrow strip tinplate is already scarce. Although the Shanghai News reported last week that Gonghexiang and Osaka firms had slightly stocked up, it was not enough for distribution. The standard market price is therefore estimated at 26 yuan per box. It is said that more than 100-200 boxes were released yesterday.</p>

<p>Passing Thoughts on Autumn (Yan Chonglou)</p>
<p>Anyone with relatively keen senses knows that early autumn has arrived.</p>
<p>However, the same early autumn evokes different feelings in different people. Literary people will plan to write some lyrical poetry, farmers will look forward to the approaching harvest, fishermen will prepare to net fat fish and large crabs for gourmets to savor the fresh delicacies, while some poor people will think of the gradually cooling weather, but they have not yet prepared even a single lined or cotton garment! …</p>
<p>People can be said to be the epitome of the seasons. Seasons have cold and warmth, and people's hearts also have coolness and heat. Seasons have spring and autumn, and people have youth and old age. Seasons change, and human nature also changes. Do the seasons adapt to people and change, or do people adapt to the seasons to survive?</p>
<p>Some say: spring belongs to young people, winter belongs to old people, then autumn can be said to belong to middle-aged people. Middle-aged people, upon reaching this early autumn, may feel that time is like water and that life is gradually aging!</p>
<p>Autumn is the season of harvest, but in the past, I have neither sown seeds nor toiled in the fields. Now I can only watch others' baskets filled with abundant fruits. To have some harvest in the autumn of next year, how should I plan a diligent life in the future?</p>
<p>Welcoming Autumn (Junmei)</p>
<p>A few intermittent slanting winds and drizzles gently lead people out of the depressing summer and into the early stages of a new autumn, exchanging it for a different scenery, a clear, beautiful and serene time.</p>
<p>Apart from a few windy and rainy days that are enough to stir up melancholy, most of autumn passes in a very graceful manner. During the day, there is a high expanse of clear sky, gauze-like clouds, a gentle sun, and a light breeze. At night, there is a crescent moon as delicate as a golden hook, or a full moon as plump as a round fan. The shadows of the clouds drift and sway, like layers of silk unfolding, the sharp and faint chirping of insects, rising and falling, comes from afar and enters our ears. In such a season filled with pictorial and poetic beauty, how can we not be moved to appreciate it and instead only feel sorrow and resentment!</p>
<p>Spring is the season for outings, summer is the season for sleeping, then this neither cold nor warm autumn is the season for young people to study. We can leisurely drink tea that is both sweet and bitter, we can happily smoke cigarettes that are both fragrant and strong, wearing a single shirt, on a small couch, under the lamp or by the moonlight, reading the books we want to read. We will no longer feel blurred vision due to sweating, nor will we feel flustered due to the abundance of fragrant flowers. Even when doing other things, we are more calm and refreshed.</p>
<p>How should we spend this beautiful autumn, so that it doesn't slip away as lightly as summer?</p>
<p>Autumn Essays (Qiulang)</p>
<p>Among the four seasons, there is the warm spring, the scorching summer, the cool autumn, and the harsh winter. They always circulate and revolve like this, never stopping. But people are not afraid of the heat of "summer" or the cold of "winter," and even the warm "spring" can sometimes be stifling. Only the arrival of "autumn" best suits the public's mood. The so-called "autumn sky is high and the air is crisp" and "the weather is already cool but not yet cold" are such praiseworthy phrases. Moreover, there are so many auspicious days such as "Qixi," "Mid-Autumn Festival," and "Double Ninth Festival" that happen to fall in this season to adorn it. Autumn! You must be a lucky one, right?</p>
<p>Autumn is highly praised, but it is not accidental. Clearness, serenity, elegance, and brightness are all expressions of its character! Furthermore, golden breezes, jade dews, colorful clouds, and moonlight – which one is not a wonderful display! If we talk about its traces, they may be born on mountain peaks, river banks, on branches, beside fences, and even extend to the sound of the flute in the frosty mornings, the sound of the mallet on the clothes-pounding stone in the moonlit evenings, on the back of the herdboy's ox, and in the boudoir of the beautiful woman…</p>
<p>What autumn bestows upon us are the yellow flowers of the three paths and the red leaves of the whole forest, enough for us to appreciate. Especially the purple crabs and green water chestnuts, a great treat for our palates. The more we obtain these, the more we feel autumn's loveliness! We all wish to sleep in autumn's embrace. Our hearts have already merged with autumn, tranquil and leisurely. On those windy mornings and moonlit evenings, we might as well hold wine, appreciate chrysanthemums, and take a leisurely drink. The joy in between is truly full of poetic and picturesque sentiment.</p>
<p>However, the wonderful autumn light and beautiful autumn colors are just like the scenery in the past, but everything about people is different. This year, I am not allowed to appreciate them. All around me is only misery and sorrow! A heart deeply wounded, and a pair of eyes filled with tears, faces the autumn scenery with worry and bewilderment! Alas! My loving and revered elder has departed westward before autumn! Leaving behind this lonely me, forlornly cast aside in the autumn wind to dream…</p>
<p>Water Caltrop (Chen Liang)</p>
<p>I happened to see fresh and lovely red water caltrops in a street vendor's blue basket. Usually, I find red things gaudy and unpleasant, but the color of the red water caltrops did not evoke such a feeling in me. It's just like a beautiful woman with fair skin, wearing a red silk shirt, smiling in the early autumn evening breeze, making her look even more alluring. The vendor, afraid that they would be scorched by the hot sun, thinly covered the surface of the basket with a layer of green duckweed leaves, the red and green complementing each other, creating a watercolor still life painting.</p>
<p>Those who paint "still life offerings on the desk" often like to use a brush dipped in a full amount of carmine to paint two or three red water caltrops on the yellow Buddha's hand or vermilion citron, which looks quite elegant.</p>
<p>In the teahouse at the City God Temple, someone peels the red water caltrop meat and puts it in a porcelain basin, selling it to the tea drinkers, and business is very good. The reason is that people are generally lazy. Buying the water caltrops and peeling them one by one before putting them in their mouths is considered a bothersome thing, so everyone buys the pre-peeled water caltrop meat to eat. I don't like this way. I prefer to peel them myself until my fingernails hurt, then I feel that the taste is especially delicious. Food obtained from suffering often has such a quality.</p>
<p>From the red water caltrops, I also thought of the green-skinned water caltrops of my hometown, which are slightly smaller in shape, but the thorns are sharper and longer, tender and sweet. Next to my house there used to be a fish pond. The fish have long stopped being raised, and every year my second aunt's family plants water caltrops. The water caltrop leaves are densely covered in the entire pond, and yellow flowers bloom in the hot summer, each flower supported by a diamond-shaped green leaf. The petals are like wax. When I return to my hometown in the summer, I like to pass by the water caltrop flowers covered with dew in the morning mist, and I feel that the serenity is better than the narcissus. Or is this just my biased preference?</p>
<p>My home is in Shangxiang (near the mountains), and there are not many ponds, so more people plant melons and fewer people plant water caltrops. Things are valued when they are rare, so my second aunt's family's water caltrops became the target of everyone, especially the children, who wanted to steal them to eat day and night. Before the water caltrop flowers had withered, the children going to early school would barefootedly turn over the water caltrop leaves. My second uncle, being a good-natured man, often stood smiling inside the wooden gate and said, "Little masters, the water caltrops haven't grown yet, don't turn over the water caltrop leaves!" The children would scatter in a huff.</p>
<p>In about half a month, we would get to eat the cooked water caltrops that my second aunt brought out. I long for the local products of my hometown.</p>
<p>Autumn Semester Begins, School Gates Open Wide, But No Money, No Entrance.</p>
<p>Autumn Lamp Miscellany (Shufan)</p>
<p>In middle age, wandering as a guest, although like a wandering monk, my thoughts of home become more profound. As the seasons change, my emotions also change accordingly. Leaning on the railing, I think of my children. I am not home, and we are each guarding our own lights. This is one sorrow. The cuckoo cries. Others admire the autumn scenery, and I am also touched, but I alone have no share in the ancestral sacrifices. This is another sorrow. In summer, I think of the melons in my hometown that are ripe. It has been a year since I left. Now is the time. So, night after night, I dream, telling the gray hair on the road, and talking to my wife about the sorrow of separation. And the flaming summer cuts the green, the cool steps sip the moon, everything is as clear as real. But when the autumn wind embraces, I suddenly and vaguely fail to return. The bean flowers on the fence bloom, and the crickets are in the hall, making it the hardest time to bear. I will make a plan to sleep in a quiet studio for three days, but then I cannot go because I have spent all my money. From then on, my dreams are on the rivers and lakes, and nothing is not sad. Waking up in fright, I only stare with dull eyes to repay my family!</p>
<p>The most clear and beautiful flowers and plants in early autumn are the fence beans, morning glories, and asparagus ferns. The blue ones are all of high quality and stand out from the mundane. They are not fragrant but have their own charm. The purple and white are mixed, and they bloom as they please. They drink the clear dew in the morning and cover the singing in the night, like scholars living in the mountains, not seeking fame but still happy to do good. This is the fence bean. The old anemones wear light makeup and are content with the simple fields, with not a trace of black emotion in their hearts, just like Bian Yujing, who has long been hidden in the Buddhist robes, abandoning the dreams of the past. This is the morning glory. The green hair is thick, and the red lips are randomly dotted, not to please others, but out of natural love. This is like Xianglan hanging curtains and sitting quietly, not putting on heavy makeup. It is the asparagus fern. There is not much space in my cold home, and apart from the pruned old trees, there are very few exotic flowers to embellish the holidays. Only when the cool breeze sends away the summer heat does the fence head add a touch of color, taking advantage of the ease of planting and enough to cultivate the soul. At dusk, I walk around, my hands behind my back, and see the disheveled scenery, just like when Cui Xiu felt the cold. If the bean flowers and morning glories are like wild old nuns, detached from the world. Since I have been walking, who is there to rely on? These few thin flowers, although they still bloom on time, I am afraid that they are not very pleasing to my nephews and nieces. In the setting sun over the fields, my thoughts are boundless!</p>
<p>The clearest and most intelligent of creatures are the grass insects. The katydids and mole crickets are especially able to express the most profound human emotions. When the white moon is three feet high, and sad songs surround it, a survivor on the battlefield will clutch his clothes and weep. When mourning cries are heard under the bed and bitter complaints are made by the dew, a lonely wife will cover her sleeves and weep. There are also reclusive scholars who, upon hearing these sounds, will sigh and say: these are all the things I want to say but cannot, how can he express them so intricately? Only creatures with spirits can express their feelings through sound, making one feel that the scenery of the cool night is joyless. Therefore, although the autumn moon is clear, it does not necessarily provoke sorrow; although the autumn air is stern, it has nothing to do with tears. With these many sorrows, the moon, dew, and stars all become its helpers, like a mourning family setting up white tents and wearing hemp clothes. A neighbor who is drunk and dancing hears nothing but the sound of joy. A person who is tired of staying at home and hears the chirping of crickets tells people: this sound is excellent. Alas! He occasionally enjoys this clear pleasure, but he thinks it is joy, while all his sorrows are outside of his own life, family, and country. In the past, when I heard the autumn insects, I only felt the pain of being poor. Since the border rivers have been shrinking day by day, the chirping of the insects has become more sorrowful, and my feelings have become deeper. Traveling in danger and eating in the open air, I feel that I cannot end the day. Someone says: it is better to work hard than to grieve in vain. Then I will answer: how can one know shame without grieving, and how can one be revitalized without feeling shame? This is another way of expressing my feelings through insects.</p>
<p>Changing Nests of Luan and Phoenix (written by Zhang Henshui)</p>
<p>Episode 6: The Iron Face Sees Parental Love, Words Hide from the Parrot; The Beautiful Eyebrows Hold Heroic Spirit, Asking About the Scriptures of Kunlun</p>
<p>Youmei stood beside him, gently shaking his arm, and smiled: I guessed it, you look so worried, something must have happened. But whether you can tell me as a close friend, that's hard to say. Menglan said: You don't need to use this aggressive method. I planned to tell you a week ago. But when I think of this, it's a phenomenon that should exist in the current transitional era. Let it rot in my heart, why bother to provoke other people's tears? So after thinking carefully, I still didn't say it. Youmei listened, stepped forward, held his hand, and whispered: Then tell me. I am willing to shed a few tears with you. Saying this, she moved closer to Menglan and leaned tightly against him. She said softly: You tell me, you tell me. Menglan said: Did you see my father when you came downstairs today? Youmei said: I saw him. Menglan said: Did he have a smile on his face? Youmei smiled: He always has that iron face. Menglan said: Then, you think about it, what else can I say? He said this and stuck out his mouth. Youmei looked out the door and saw a corner of someone's clothes in the corridor. So she said: That's Xiaoju sitting there, I don't know what needlework she is doing. So Menglan took the paper and pen on the table and wrote a line of words: "Containing emotions, wanting to speak of palace affairs, one dares not speak in front of the parrot." After writing, she threw the pen away. Youmei felt some sadness for his unspeakable pain. Standing by the chair, looking at the words on the table, she hesitated a lot. She tapped her toes on the floor for a while, and then whispered: Since that's the case, then you don't mention anything. I understand two or three things in my heart. If there is anything you want me to do, it's still the same sentence, I will definitely help. Menglan said: Helping is inevitable. But I hope you don't tell anyone else. Youmei smiled: You haven't said a word about your worries to me, what would I tell others? Menglan said: When I need your help, I won't need anyone to tell me, I will definitely come to you. I just think that if that day really comes, my life will be unpredictable. So I think, maybe I won't have such a day. As he spoke, he shook his head twice. Youmei said: Listening to your accent, there is really a lot of bitterness in your heart. Saying this, she tilted her head slightly, frowned tightly, glanced at him, and her face also showed a thoughtful look. Menglan smiled, nodded slightly to Youmei and said: You don't need to guess, no god can guess my thoughts. Youmei smiled: Although I am not a god, I can still guess some of your thoughts. While saying this, Xiaoju brought in a teapot, smiling at the two of them. Menglan said: What are you laughing at? You are hiding outside listening to us talk. Do you think I don't know? (73)</p>
<p>Three Wonders of Nantang (Nanding)</p>
<p>Every year when the golden autumn wind is refreshing, it is the time when the lotus ponds bear fruit and come onto the market. There are three kinds of products from the lotus ponds: the fruit of the lotus flower, which is the lotus seed; the root of the lotus stem, which is the lotus root; and the fox nut produced in the pond, which together make up three kinds of delicious and unparalleled delicacies. However, these three kinds of fine fruits differ greatly in taste depending on their place of origin. The same lotus seeds, lotus roots, and fox nuts have distinctions between tender, sweet, fragrant, and glutinous, and old, bland, coarse, and hard. The products of Nantang in Suzhou are the most famous, and cannot be compared with other places. Therefore, at the beginning of autumn, all those who travel to Suzhou must bring some lotus roots produced in Nantang to share with their friends.</p>
<p>Lotus seeds are the seeds in the lotus pods, and the lotus pods are the fruits of the lotus flower. When the hot summer days come, the lotus flowers are in full bloom, and the clear breeze sends fragrance, there is a special coolness. By early autumn, the lotus petals gradually fall, and lotus pods are formed. Each lotus pod contains dozens of lotus seeds, which are fragrant, sweet, and tender, and very delicious. However, lotus seeds have white lotus and red lotus distinctions. White lotus is produced in Nantang, and is best for eating raw. Red lotus has slightly red lotus shells, and is suitable for storage. That is, the lotus seeds sold in the Southern goods stores, with those produced in Hunan being the best, are called Xiang lotus. Usually, lotus seed soup is made with Xiang lotus, not fresh lotus seeds. Generally, lotus seeds can be eaten in two ways, raw or cooked. For raw eating, the seeds are peeled from the lotus pods, the skin is removed, and the seeds are chewed, which tastes sweet and fragrant. However, this is only limited to tender lotus seeds. If harvested at the wrong time, the lotus seeds are old, and feel old and bland, tasting like chewing wax. Cooked food can be divided into two extremes. One is to take the tender lotus seeds, peel the meat, boil them in soup, and add ice sugar to eat, without losing the flavor of the lotus seeds. The other is to use old lotus seeds, simmer them over a low flame, and mix them with ice sugar. The taste is hundreds of times better than Xiang lotus.</p>
<p>Although lotus root is called snow lotus root, it is mostly a food for the hot summer, but the most abundant time is in early autumn. There are pond lotus roots and field lotus roots distinctions. Field lotus roots cannot compare with the tender, crisp, sweet pond lotus roots, especially those produced in Futang, which are the most famous. The distinction between good and bad lies in tenderness and oldness, sweetness and blandness. Generally, lotus roots with small holes and thick flesh can be regarded as the best. There are one section, two sections, and three sections several kinds. One section is the best, and three sections is the worst. In addition to eating raw, there are several ways to eat lotus roots that are delicious. If the lotus root is grounded, and the juice is extracted, it is lotus root juice, which has the effect of clearing heat, cooling the lungs, and stopping bleeding. Therefore, Chinese medicine often uses lotus root in medicine to treat the lungs. If the lotus root is sliced, coated with flour and sugar, and fried in oil until golden, fragrant, and crispy, it is called lotus root cake. The lotus root contains a kind of starch. There is often precipitation of this kind of powdery substance under the lotus root slices, which is lotus root flour. Adding water and sugar can make a thick porridge-like paste, which is also very fragrant, and has absolutely no residue, and is especially suitable for patients. After the lotus root is old, the sweetness and crispness are lost, and the powdery substance is more abundant, making it best for making lotus root flour. Lotus root from Nantang in Suzhou is sweet, crisp, and tender, making it good for eating raw. In other places, lotus root is added with sugar, or used to make dishes, and the taste of the lotus root is completely lost. These kinds of lotus roots are all inferior.</p>
<p>Fox nut is a fruit produced in the pond. The leaves are larger than the lotus, lying flat on the water surface. Purple flowers bloom in summer, and spherical fruits are formed in autumn. Each sphere contains hundreds of fox nuts. The shell is red and round, and the flesh inside is as white as pearls. The fox nuts produced in Nantang have thin shells, large flesh, and a glutinous and fragrant taste, so they are called the best. However, peeling the shells takes a lot of time, which is what people who like to eat fox nuts hate. The fox nuts sold in Southern goods stores are dried fox nut meat, with those from Nantang also being the best, because the flesh is softer and more glutinous. There are two most common ways to eat fox nut. One is to peel the meat, put it in boiling water with ice sugar, and it is ready in a boil. It is fragrant and tender, and the soup is slightly green. The color, fragrance, and taste are all excellent. Just remember not to rinse or overcook after peeling the meat. Once rinsed, the fragrance will be lost, and overcooking will make the meat old. Therefore, when peeling, you must first wash your hands and the fox nuts. When cooking, first boil the water with ice sugar, and then add the fox nuts. It will be ready after boiling once, so you can get the delicious flavor of the fox nuts. Another way to eat it is to mash the meat, add water and sugar, and cook it into a porridge-like paste, called fox nut porridge, which is most suitable for the elderly. As for how to eat dried fox nuts, they must be simmered until tender, which is not the same as fresh fox nut meat.</p>

<p>Determining the Treatment of Gonorrhea from a Pharmacological Perspective</p>
<p>Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>Giving Strong Evidence to Changes in Mucosal Cells</p>
<p>Phagocytosis Phenomena Produced by Intraperitoneal Injection</p>
<p>I do not wish to use common knowledge to state that a certain treatment for gonorrhea is reliable, and another is unreliable. I also do not wish to use four-character or eight-sentence phrases to describe a disease to cater to low-level interests, and exaggerate for this purpose. I think back to when I studied at the Imperial University of Japan, I focused on venereology day and night. Among venereal diseases, syphilis has 606 and soft chancre has special drugs, but gonorrhea alone has no definite treatment. Therefore, the prevalence of gonorrhea is extremely high. Therefore, famous scholars and professors in that country have worked hard to study it. Scholars and experts from all over the world have paid more attention to it. After countless people's exploration, the German Peter Chuan Shi finally summed up the success and invented the gonorrhea sacred product "Kelinong".</p>
<p>Now let me talk about the pharmacological effects of "Kelinong". However, readers must pay attention and understand, because what is said here is the latest and most profound academic theory.</p>
<p>For all chronic gonorrhea patients, male or female, as well as prostatitis, orchitis (male), uterine inflammation, leucorrhea, vulvar gonorrhea (female), etc., their mucosal cells have significant changes. These changes can be obtained from tissue examination: ordinary round cells change from island-shaped to flat epithelial cells. After taking "Kelinong", the cells return to their normal state. After taking it for about six weeks, it will be completely cured and will not recur. The testers of this drug theory are Bumm, Jadassohn, P. Gohn, Chuan Shi -</p>
<p>Also, take gonococci and inject them into the abdomen of horses, the virulence and antitoxin properties of the gonococcal ascites are particularly strong. If fed with "Kelinong" powder, white blood cells in the ascites will greatly exhibit phagocytic and antibacterial effects, and gonococci will die instantly. I use "Kelinong" to eliminate the gonococcal toxins in the human body, and all of them are completely eliminated. However, for women's gonorrhea and leucorrhea, in addition to taking "Kelinong", it is best to use "Kaerxue Di" as a vaginal suppository for external use. The two are completely non-irritating.</p>
<p>The New Comet in Hormone Preparations</p>
<p>Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Promoting Development, Saving Sexual Function from Aging</p>
<p>The reasons for human underdevelopment and premature aging of sexual function are nothing more than the decline or abnormality of endocrine function, resulting in various parts of the body not being able to obtain this hormone supply, and therefore not being able to achieve normal development and natural aging. A hundred diseases arise from this.</p>
<p>For symptomatic treatment of these diseases, oral hormone preparations are the most appropriate. However, in the past hundred years, I do not know how many kinds of hormone preparations have been produced, but none of them have achieved the effects that we idealize. When I was old at the Moscow Labor University of Russia, I extensively read endocrinology journals and newspapers from all over the world, and unanimously praised the male and female hormone preparations "Butikang" and "Bunurong" invented by the German Meringer, as the new comet in hormone preparations. For the raw materials of these two drugs, he first selected brave and youthful animals, and used new scientific methods to select pure hormones. Any rough and impure ingredients were removed. Because if there are slight impurities, the useful hormones will be reduced and become waste. The "Butikang" and "Bunurong" drugs have been repeatedly chemically tested by the governments of various countries, and they are indeed pure hormone preparations, so the effect is rapid and lasting after taking them. It is different from ordinary products. For underdevelopment caused by early masturbation, excessive lust, etc., the lower part is as short as a child, impotence caused by reduced performance, premature ejaculation, weak erection, or complete failure to lift. Headache, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, lower back pain, weak feet, premature aging, white hair and wrinkles all over the forehead, taking "Butikang" for four or five weeks will completely transform the sexual tissues, and can supplement the hormones lacking in the whole body, accelerate the metabolism, and develop normally. The aforementioned various sexual neurasthenia diseases can be completely cured. I have practiced for many years in Moscow, and after returning to China, I have always used this medicine to cure thousands of people.</p>
<p>A New Drug for Treating Gonorrhea That Can Produce Special Effects</p>
<p>Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>The Effect is Far-Reaching and Directly Attacks the Bacteria Nest</p>
<p>Everyone knows that gonococci are stubborn inferior microorganisms that do not die from heat or cold. This bacterium also has a kind of ability to run rampant, from the local part of the reproductive organs, to the whole body. Whenever there is something to take advantage of, they will take advantage of it. For example, if you come into contact with a person who does not have gonorrhea, then this gonococcus will be like discovering a new continent and developing outward. The reason why gonorrhea is extremely easy to spread to others is that it is here.</p>
<p>Therefore, the treatment to eradicate gonorrhea must have special efficacy drugs. After taking it, all the cells of the body will produce a kind of antitoxin. No matter where the gonococci are hidden, they must be surrounded by this kind of drug and destroyed. The drug "Kelinong" invented by the German Peter has the above conditions. No matter how stubborn the gonococci are, after taking "Kelinong", all cells in the body will develop an antitoxic effect in a short period of time, and jointly exert a general attack of bactericidal power. , directly attack the bacteria nest, and wipe out all gonococcal bacteria. It is by no means comparable to the palliative and thwarted therapy of local transmembrane sterilization. And it does not harm healthy tissues, and absolutely does not obstruct the gastrointestinal tract, irritate the kidneys, etc. This is the special feature of "Kelinong", which is beyond the reach of any gonorrhea drug. I have used this drug to cure long-term gonorrhea, initial gonorrhea and gonorrhea variants, etc., and all of them were cured within five or six weeks. (Initial acute gonorrhea can be cured in about three weeks.) I still remember that I went to the South Seas Islands for a trip, and lived with a friend. A patient surnamed Jin had suffered from gonorrhea for many years, and his wife was also infected. He had taken gonorrhea drugs from various countries but did not work. Later, I introduced "Kelinong" and it was completely cured in five weeks. His wife's leucorrhea was also treated with "Kafu Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository, and "Kelinong" was taken internally for four weeks, and she was completely cured. This is the evidence of the effectiveness of "Kelinong".</p>
<p>Neurasthenia in Women</p>
<p>Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>The Source of Infertility -</p>
<p>There are many symptoms of neurasthenia in women, such as headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, palpitations, depression, extreme memory and memorization decline, and personality changes. Often, small things can also cause pessimism, or secretly shed tears, weeping behind people's backs. In all the surrounding environments, there is nothing that does not arouse their sorrow. The eyes are dull and lifeless. The subsequent symptoms include loss of appetite, malnutrition, pale skin, anemia, difficult menstruation, inability to arrive on time. Or from small amount to amenorrhea, it becomes the main cause of infertility. In addition, there are dark blue circles around the eyes, leucorrhea, vaginal erosion, and difficulty in urination and sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>If women have these symptoms, their families are often very happy, and even the love between husband and wife is broken and they fly away like partridges. Even if not, the happiness of their family will inevitably be swallowed up by this disease. The main cause of this disease is the lack of hormones, but the "Bunurong" invented by Meringer can cure it. This drug is made from female hormones, so it is effective for female neurasthenia, irregular menstruation and menopause, and long-term infertility. Because "Bunurong" has the effect of promoting endocrine function. Dr. Krebs and others have experimented with it, and it can indeed be effective for neurasthenia and other symptoms. When I was in Moscow, I treated Mrs. Torana for neurasthenia and irregular menstruation. After taking it, she recovered within a few weeks. However, for women with leucorrhea, "Kaerxue Di Vaginal Tablets" must be used as a suppository, and "Bunurong" should still be taken internally to exert the effect of the two drugs, so the results are very excellent and have long been praised by Europeans and Americans.</p>
<p>The Rescue of Masturbation and What Causes Non-Masturbatory Spermatorrhea?</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>According to Dr. Nagahama Shigeru's research, one drop of semen is equal to twenty drops of blood. According to this, those who like to commit suicide by masturbation, the harm they cause is really unimaginable. Semen has a special relationship with the nervous system. Those who masturbate or have excessive sexual activity often have neurasthenia and spermatorrhea. After a long time, the vas deferens loses its control, and when working, defecating, or sexually excited, semen will break out, which is called spermatorrhea. Semen leaks, and premature ejaculation and impotence also follow.</p>
<p>For the rational treatment of spermatorrhea, modern scholars all regard "sedative nerve therapy" as the first priority. This is the root cause, and strengthening the sperm is the superficial treatment. Therefore, taking "Naierxi Spermatorrhea Tablets" is the first priority for spermatorrhea. Let me talk about the reason:</p>
<p>Professor Vannod said that masturbation and spermatorrhea are caused by neurasthenia of the reproductive organs. Dr. Christmas said that non-masturbatory spermatorrhea is caused by congenital hormone deficiency. Dr. Wagner said that spermatorrhea caused by overwork is caused by peripheral nerve hypersensitivity. Their conclusion is that sedative nerve is the absolute treatment, so "Naierxi Spermatorrhea Tablets" should be taken to sedate it. Because this kind of efficacy is good at eliminating improper lust, so it has the effect of stopping masturbation. Because the excessive excitement of the nerves and the peripheral hypersensitivity disappear, the vas deferens also restores its control ability, so taking this medicine can cure spermatorrhea and spermatorrhea caused by any reason. Those who have spermatorrhea five or six times a week can be cured. It is best to take "Butikang" at the same time to increase physical strength and start its impotence, and the success will be faster!</p>
<p>Pulmonary Tuberculosis Notes</p>
<p>Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University, Dr. Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>Clinic: At the corner of Sichuan Road and Shubo Road</p>
<p>Clinic Hours: 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>My relationship with pulmonary tuberculosis can be said to be extremely close. When I was teaching at the medical university in the past, I liked to devote my efforts to the study of pulmonology. Later, when I was the head of the Shanghai Nanping People's Hospital, there were more and more patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis who were treated, and all achieved special results. It was really unexpected at first.</p>
<p>Now I will describe a case for readers' reference, so as to avoid being at a loss when faced with the disease.</p>
<p>There was Mr. Wu Ding, a student from Huzhou, who was 23 years old. He had suffered from lung disease for two years. It started with a cold in the autumn. He coughed for several days, and taking 00 syrup was ineffective. Later, blood appeared in the sputum. After treatment by the doctor, the blood stopped slightly. The remaining symptoms remained the same. Night sweats, slight fever in the afternoon, and chest pain were reported, as well as lack of appetite. Almost completely insomnia every night, and spermatorrhea, and the body was thin. It had been more than a year like this, and hundreds of treatments were ineffective. Introduced by a friend, he came to me for treatment. After X-ray examination, almost the entire right lung was damaged, and there were infiltration symptoms between the third and fifth ribs of the left lung. Percussion sound was dull, and auscultation revealed bubbling sound (as shown in Figure A). Given Ipecac Tinct Ipeca and Almond Water Apua Pruni Armeriaca, etc., although the cough was reduced, there was no definite effect. Therefore, "Bubao Feinaer" was taken for about three weeks, sputum and chest pain were eliminated, and appetite increased. Therefore, he was told to continue taking it. On the one hand, "Butikang" was taken to strengthen physical strength, nourish the brain and blood, and then "Naierxi Spermatorrhea Tablets" were used to treat his spermatorrhea. After eight weeks, all the symptoms were cured, weight increased, and the spirit was comfortable. The X-ray taken last month showed that the lung disease had been completely</p>
<h3>The Evolution of the Soviet Income Tax System</h3>
<p>— Ren Binglian</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>The income tax is a novel form of taxation, a product of highly developed capitalism. England was the first to adopt the income tax system, back in the 1790s. As everyone knows, England is the ancestor of capitalism, so it emerged particularly early. More than sixty years later, the United States also adopted this system, followed by Italy (1864), Japan (1887), France (1914), and Germany. Recently, even colonial China has considered the proposal to adopt income tax. Naturally, China is not a capitalist country, so implementing an income tax may not be possible, and whether it would benefit the people and the nation remains questionable. However, non-capitalist countries adopting income tax did not begin with China; the current tax system in the Soviet Union also includes income tax.</p>
<p>However, the income tax implemented in the Soviet Union is fundamentally different from that of capitalist countries. Although, technically, there are still some commonalities, such as the need for a complete social statistical bookkeeping system. Without complete statistics, imposing taxes would be extremely difficult. With the high development of capitalism, this complete accounting system undoubtedly emerged, so the emergence of the income tax system in capitalist society is not surprising at all.</p>
<p>The capitalist income tax is still a form of exploitative taxation. Although on the surface it is a direct tax, and its tax rate is progressive, this does not equalize the burden between the rich and the poor, because the means of production in capitalism are already controlled by a small number of people. They have larger expenditures on taxes, and naturally have larger exploitative income from production. Therefore, this burden is still passed on to the laborers, which is undoubtedly the case.</p>
<p>Socialist countries no longer have an exploitative system, and their means of production are not controlled by a small number of people, but by the laboring masses, the proletariat of workers and peasants. As a result, the tax system in the Soviet Union is no longer a form of exploitation, and income tax is naturally no exception.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of income tax in the Soviet Union is not without its own characteristics.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the Soviet income tax are, first, strict class-based taxation of income earners. Second, incentives for socialized operations, granting various preferential treatments in taxation. These characteristics are distinctly different from the income tax of capitalist countries.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and the main points of taxation are: first, to safeguard the interests of the proletariat of workers and peasants as a prerequisite; second, to collectivize industry, agriculture, and various production sectors, vigorously reduce small individual businesses, and eliminate the remnants of capitalism; third, to use the form of taxation to balance the burden between the rich and the poor, and even eliminate class boundaries. Income tax, this novel form of taxation, naturally undertakes the same tasks here.</p>
<p>The evolution of income tax in the Soviet Union is closely linked to the transformation of the entire society. Originally, there had been proposals to implement income tax since the old Russian era, but they were not successful due to social and political turmoil. However, old Russia was a capitalist country, which was contrary to the social system of the Soviet Union, so the methods of implementation would naturally be different from those of the Soviet Union today.</p>
<p>However, to trace the transformation of the Soviet socio-economy and its impact on the current income tax system, we must start from the old Russian era.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>We have already said that income tax is a product of capitalism, so its emergence is only possible after capitalism matures. This was naturally also the case in Russia.</p>
<p>After the Crimean War, capitalism in Russia began to rise. In the 1860s, the Russian financial system began to change with the rise of capitalism, and the previous prescriptive financial system was gradually replaced by a new system. Replacing the old-style poll tax with an income tax system also began to brew during this period.</p>
<p>In 1887, Russia abolished the poll tax, and tax revenue naturally decreased. The financial authorities had to open up new sources of revenue to compensate for the shortfall in expenditures. Therefore, in 1892, a proposal to create an income tax was put forward, but it was not adopted. Instead, a new tax system was implemented in the second year: housing tax. This tax system had a strong poll tax flavor, but its tax rate was progressive. At that time, the tax rate was stipulated to progress from 1.67% of the rental price to 10%. A tax rate of 1.67% was the average minimum, and a tax rate of 10% was the maximum; housing below a certain price was exempt from this tax.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is conceivable that Russian capitalism had not yet matured. After the end of the 19th century, the capitalist countries of Europe had gradually entered a period of rapid development. Russian capitalism also made amazing progress during this period, and large-scale business organizations continued to emerge. During this period, wealth became more concentrated in the hands of a small number of people. The profits of capitalists and entrepreneurs increased due to the development of industry, and the number of salaried workers and laborers also increased. Needless to say, this provided objective conditions suitable for the implementation of income tax in Russia. Therefore, the Russian government also found its new source of revenue from this socio-economic situation. Income tax began to be adopted partially. At that time, the first taxes implemented were the joint-stock company tax and the salary tax.</p>
<p>At that time, there were still people who opposed the adoption of income tax. Among them, the most vocal opponent was the then Minister of Finance, Witte, who put forward seven major reasons. He believed that:</p>
<p>(1) The general level of education of the people is very low, making it difficult to obtain accurate declarations of income.</p>
<p>(2) All public and private accounting is incomplete, making it difficult to have a reliable basis for investigating income.</p>
<p>(3) Due to the difficulties of the first two items, to carry out effective collection, it is necessary to impose considerable coercion, which greatly hinders the personal freedom of taxpayers, and makes it easier for tax officials to fall into arbitrary assumptions that are not based on facts.</p>
<p>(4) Therefore, it can also cause tax evasion, which will have a bad impact on national morality.</p>
<p>(5) The wealthy people account for a very small number, which will inevitably require a large number of collection fees, while the tax revenue obtained is very small.</p>
<p>(6) Income tax is sufficient to hinder the accumulation of capital and hinder the necessary investment in industry.</p>
<p>(7) Income tax can only be adopted after sufficient reform of other direct taxes.</p>
<p>These reasons also became the focus of government consideration at that time. We have said that before implementing income tax, there must be a necessary condition, that is: there must be a complete social statistical bookkeeping system. Therefore, Witte's second reason naturally made the Russian government encounter difficulties in implementing income tax.</p>
<p>Russia was a backward capitalist country, so it retained a certain innate backwardness. The lack of a complete statistical accounting system was one of them. As a result, the implementation of income tax was not included in the regulations until the promulgation of the Constitution in 1905, the change of the financial organization, and the discussions of the second, third, and fourth National Assemblies after 1907.</p>
<p>As a result, the income tax system in Russia became a difficult birth. Until 1914, after the outbreak of the cruel World War, on the one hand, due to the government's need for huge war expenses, and also due to the abolition of the liquor monopoly and the reduction of railway tariffs, the national finances suddenly felt strained. Therefore, income tax became the central issue discussed by the National Assembly again. Subsequently, the Income Tax Law was formulated on April 6, 1916, and implemented in 1917.</p>
<p>The income tax law formulated at that time was largely based on Prussia's, and adopted a comprehensive taxation system, so it contained a strong poll tax flavor. Its tax rate ranged from 0.6% for an annual income of 850 rubles to 12.5% for an annual income of more than 400,000 rubles. However, those with an annual income of less than 850 rubles were exempted. In addition, there were several regulations for tax exemption and various special deductions.</p>
<p>However, after the implementation of income tax, the old Russian government was still unable to maintain the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, and the raising of war expenses increased the government's burden. The outbreak of the February Revolution made the domestic political economy more chaotic. In order to plan for huge expenses, the Provisional Government issued 6 billion rubles of short-term treasury bills and 4 billion rubles of free public bonds, and from April 1917, levied a 30% surcharge on income tax. Due to the excessive issuance of paper money, the ruble continued to fall, which increased the burden on the people. The fall of the ruble also affected the increase in war expenses, and the financial needs became even greater. In this situation, the Provisional Government had to find a new source of revenue, which led to the emergence of a temporary extraordinary income tax, which was implemented in June 1919.</p>
<p>However, the implementation of this tax system only lasted for a few months, and it was terminated with the fall of the Provisional Government. The Soviet regime replaced the Provisional Government, and the regulations of the income tax system also underwent another change.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>After the October Revolution, the implementation of income tax in Russia was a period of transformation and reform. Economic changes and political reforms were linked. As the Soviet government took control of the political power, the national economic life of Russia naturally underwent new changes.</p>
<p>The era of War Communism was the infancy of the Soviet government, and its feathers had not yet fully grown. The difficulties encountered at this time are conceivable. The first was being surrounded by international imperialism; the second was to fight against domestic reactionary forces. The Soviet government's financial burden at that time was still greater than that of the Provisional Government, and its fundraising was even more difficult. At that time, the main sources of revenue were compulsory requisition of products, disposal of state-owned property, confiscation of the property of wealthy peasants and capitalists, and the issuance of Soviet paper money... In addition to this, the Soviets could only find a source of revenue from taxes. Therefore, changing the old tax system became the main objective at that time.</p>
<p>In the reform of the tax system, the main reform of income tax was: stipulating that all large incomes above a certain amount should be confiscated. At that time, the standard for large incomes in Moscow and Leningrad was: after deducting the amount of income tax, the maximum income was 72,000 paper rubles, and anything exceeding this limit would be confiscated. As a result, after March 1919, the income from the progressive tax on income tax greatly increased. This was a considerable gain in the Soviet government's financial policy at the time.</p>
<p>In the second year after the October Revolution, the government promulgated an extraordinary revolutionary tax, which was the same in nature as income tax, but its purpose was only to forcibly collect from private capital. However, the result was not very effective. Therefore, it was abolished in February 1921. In March of the same year, the compulsory requisition of grain was also abolished, and a tax in kind of 10% of the harvest was levied. This period was the transition from War Communism to the era of the New Economic Policy.</p>
<p>The New Economic Policy was implemented in 1921. In June of that year, the government adopted a business tax, and monetary taxes were gradually restored. The implementation of the New Economic Policy was a major key for the Soviet Union to escape from hunger, disease, and suffering, so the financial policy of this period is worth our attention.</p>
<p>In order to relieve the famine at that time, the government had to find ways to plan for a huge amount of relief funds, and the finances at that time were in a difficult situation. Therefore, the only way was to find new sources of revenue from taxes. Later, two resolutions on citizen tax were levied in 1922, and the result was able to reach the predetermined amount. Moreover, due to the collection of monetary taxes, the socio-economy at that time was restored to the state of a monetary circulation economy. This was a turning point in Soviet financial policy.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the New Economic Policy, due to the rapid development of private enterprises, the "new rich" (Nepman) occupied a large force in small and medium-sized industries. In order to eliminate and suppress the rise of this force, the government created a new income and property tax on November 16, 1922. This tax system was renamed income tax in the following year, and its tax standard was based on the amount of income and property.</p>
<p>In May of the second year, the government abolished the previous direct tax on farmers, and combined it into a single agricultural tax. Farmers who bear the single agricultural tax can be exempted from the income tax burden. A month later, a special income tax was adopted, which was specifically for state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and public-private mixed enterprises.</p>
<p>In 1925, the Soviet government gave new stimulus to state-owned production enterprises, so that the productivity increased day by day, so it tried its best to suppress the expansion of private enterprises. In this way, the tax policy naturally had to adapt to this situation and be improved. Therefore, in June 1926, there was a revision of the income tax and business tax, in April 1920, there was a revision of the single agricultural tax, and a new revision of the income tax in December... Subsequently, in December 1929, the state and enterprise income tax was raised from a tax rate of 8% of net profit to 20%. And in October 1919 and June 1931, two resolutions were made to supplement and revise the provisions of income tax. Make it more in line with the Soviet government's financial policy and conducive to the development of the Soviet economy.</p>
<p>This revision is the income tax system implemented in the Soviet Union today. The Soviet economy, due to the increasing development of industry, has gradually become stable, so income tax is no longer a means and method of planning expenses like the era of War Communism, but has become a form of taxation in the Soviet tax system today. Moreover, the fundamental difference between it and the taxation of capitalism can be seen from its evolution.</p>
<p>From the table below, we can clearly see the evolution of income tax in the Soviet Union. And we can also see the ratio between it and the total tax revenue in the evolution:</p>

<h3>Securities The Bond Market Remained Dull Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, from September 7th to 12th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained stagnant and hovering, without breaking away from the dull state. The trading was light, sometimes only one hundred and several tens of thousands. It really opened a new record for the most idle securities trading. The total number of chips is estimated to be nearly 200 million. The number of exchange deposits has greatly decreased compared with the past. Large households have obviously withdrawn from the front line. If this continues, the future is worrying. The market price results last week, although compared with the rise of one-fifth of a yuan to four jiao, it is quite difficult to continue to rise. It is feared that it is still a situation of hovering and brewing. Last week, only on Monday, Guangxi cooperated with the government, and the market price rose by half a yuan. But the result was only two or three jiao. From Tuesday to Friday, it was completely a stagnant phenomenon. It is permissible to say that Friday was the most deserted, and Saturday was slightly firm. The phenomenon of prosperity is still not available. The total turnover for the week was 22.85 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the left table for comparison.

<h3>Grain The Guaranteed Price of River Rice is Reduced by Another One or Two Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs numbered thirteen and fourteen, with a total of two thousand four or five hundred shi. The sales were sluggish. The package dealers, such as the Qingdao and Qinhuangdao gangs, only handled more than two hundred packages. Therefore, the market conditions were tired. The price of thick and thin japonica rice was reduced by a few points. The price of Dongxin japonica rice was barely fixed due to the intermittent cloudy and sunny weather. The sales of new Yanglu sharp were not good, and the price depreciated by nearly a chi. The Yinbian yuan maintained a normal state.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs under the river numbered about twenty. The appetite for all colors in the market was still sluggish. The selling price of broken japonica rice was about one jiao lower. The price of new Yangbu sharp was one or two jiao shorter. The price of thin indica rice was also flat and tired. The price of new Kexi sharp was nearly a jiao lower. The Dongxin japonica and Chen Yang sharp were stable.</p>

<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods New Honey Dates Have Also Appeared, with Bare Dates Selling for 42 Yuan</h3>
<p>This year, because the production of fresh dates is not abundant, the honey dates from Jiaxing, Lanxi, and other places fell to 34-35 yuan. Recently, the market has gradually tightened. Yesterday, bare dates from Lanxi sold for 38 yuan, and bare dates from Huigong on the top shelf have also appeared, selling for 42 yuan. The usual additions and deductions are applied to the upper and lower grades. The trend is firm, with signs of further tightening. It is also heard that the production price in Lanxi is rising due to the scarcity of upper-grade dates.</p>
