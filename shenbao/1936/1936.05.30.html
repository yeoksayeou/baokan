<h3 id="c13">日駐軍強化後的華北 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>日本對華外交一方而標榜著一元化政策滿口親善提携邦交調整一方面積極擴充華北駐軍放任浪人走私事實上仍舊是兩重外交的作風我國負責當局樅然舌敝唇焦披肝瀝膽表示渴求和平的萬分誠意也不能變更它旣定的方針放鬆它蠶食的主張現在首當其衝的當然是華北自從日軍强化部隊陸續開抵平津以後冀察外交的談判已吿停頓冀東偽組織的取消終歸幻滅河北省境內鐵路沿綫正在配駐日兵古北口等處著手興築砲台瞻望前途眞令人不寒而慄</p>
<p>日對增兵華北答覆我國的抗議謂「日方因鑒於華北不安現狀爲使日本駐軍行使任務無遺憾起見增加兵力爲絕對必要此係以辛丑和约爲根據並不違反慣例至增兵數額擬限於必要之最少限度不致威脅我國更不侵害一權」等語不知道在日人心目中的辛丑條約和慣例作何解釋關於此點本報前已詳有論列茲不贅述至於以華北不安現狀爲理由目下竄晋共匪業已肅淸冀察防共更極周密實已無所藉口此外華北的不安如走私猖獗浪人跋扈等等其原動力究竟在那裏呢以常理論我國增兵維持治安才是正當日方增兵祗有增加不安的成分罷了</p>
<p>最近日方在華北的舉動經濟開發和軍事擴張兼顧並進而有相互合作推進的妙用經濟開發以滿鐵爲中心進行收買華北各紗廠推廣植棉開發煤礦修築滄石鐵　籌劃公路交通再以軍事爲後盾威脅要挾使經濟開發的進行更順利無阻日方外交的慣例就是以最小的犧牲獲得最大的利益現在對於華北已認爲到了慣例的時期了據天津傳來消息華北日駐屯軍新司令官田代曾召開幹部會議傳達軍部頒到新計劃又日外務省亦擬派東亞局長桑原赴華北活動進行華北工作具體的調整種種事實都値得我們特別注意的</p>
<p>總之華北在現階段下已非空言和運用外交的理論所能補救因爲問題的徵結在日不在我我們仍希望日本朝野盡最後的努力促軍閥的覺悟使中日邦交整個調整能見成功樹立束亞永久和平的大計同時我們深信除自力更生埋頭苦幹外實在沒有其他救國方法而自力更生的唯一條件就是國內必先步調一致發揮整個的力量保障我們士地的完整主權的存在和民族的安全換一句話說就是舉國精誠團結每個人都應盡其救國的責任勿求苟安勿稍畏縮努力打破當前的難關以期達到光明的途徑</p>

<p>上海市商會執行委員鄭澄淸、前月勾串該會辭退職員張伯言偽造市商會派令調查之文書、冒簽主席委員俞佐庭名義、向上海紡織印染公司圖詐五萬金、被該公司總經理章榮初舉發、並牽涉市商會執委主王某陸某、一時形勢、甚為嚴重、事為國府當局所聞、因即進行查究、至市商會本身、除召集全體執監委員迭　緊急會議、根據告發人提出鄭等偽造之文件及鄭之自白議决、將鄭澄淸之執行</p>
<p>委員革除　以肅紀綱外、對於鄭·張·兩點、認為觸犯刑章、爰由該會主席俞佐庭代表市商會、委任袁漢雲律師向第一特區地方法院提起刑事自訴、略以鄭澄情於本年三月間、偽造調查文件、並於該文書末尾假冒俞佐庭名義、批註「請鄭澄淸先生密查」八字、及署「佐庭」兩字、而先由張伯方函致上海紡織印染公司、假借俞佐庭密派鄭澄淸以調查該公司承製黨國旗、其質料有無</p>

<p>承認偽造　不諱、故現已議决將鄭之執委名義撤除、至鄭等向章有所要求、究竟要求何物、當其在會承認時、　以非監委、未列席、故不能知云云、隨將偽造之文件·張致章之信函·市商會執監委會對於此案之往來文件·及鄭等自白之筆錄、一併呈案、以備審核、繼據見正章榮初供稱、三十六歲、吳興人、住大西路一百十二號、任上海紡織印染公司總經理、四月二十日以前、張伯方來函、言所製之黨國旗、彼可</p>

<p>從中設法　言時、並提市商會之調查文件、着我給其五萬金、俾挽王·陸·兩先生補救、我與張雖有一面之雅、但最近兩年、則未晤面、當時張尙言渠於年前曾煩王·陸·兩先生了結一事、故此次宜仍委託辦理、我聞張語、依然不為所惑、而於是獨先以電話詢於俞主席、據復並無派調查之事、因於次日將張所交之調查文件、送由俞閱、方悉</p>

<p>人體神經系統。密佈全身。總幹在腦。曰腦神經。主幹在脊。曰脊髓神經。在於生殖器部者曰性神經。</p>
<p>各部神經。息息相關。故如一部神經衰弱。則他部受其影響。如遷延失治。則其結果。咸成全身神經衰弱。</p>
<p>神經系統之健全與否。視乎腺器內分泌榮養之良否。而生殖腺內分泌之重要。尤為全身各腺器之冠。</p>
<p>生殖腺內分泌與性神經系統不僅有最密切之關係。且對於腦神經與脊髓神經。亦具直接榮養之功。</p>
<p>性神經衰弱症之最重要及習見者。為早洩，腎痿，遺精。統簡稱之曰性病。其治法以生殖腺製劑「生殖素」為最對症。如能同時兼受電療。則就治更速。</p>

<p>遺精一症。雖有有夢與無夢之別。然其病源則一。故治法亦同。</p>
<p>本症除投服「生殖素」外。當並服「希米脫氏固精片」。蓋本症患者。其輸精管咸感鬆弛也。</p>
<p>今春有靑年患者諸金龍君。來訴每月遺精有十餘次之多。遺洩過頻。以致精虧腦弱。血枯神衰。並罹失眠健忘。面黃肌瘦等症。經余囑向永安公司西藥部購服「希米脫氏固精片」以治其遺洩。並服「生殖素」以補其精腦氣血，為期月許。各症俱痊。回復壯健。如慶重生云。</p>

<h3 id="c258">談談婦女解放運動的過去 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 秋瑛</p>
<p>男女同樣是「圓顱方趾，橫目睿心。」照理應享同等的權利，但是在過去，男子是人，女子好像是一件東西，給男子所佔有的附屬物，沒有敎育均等的機會，沒有職業上的平等，沒有政治的參與，男女相互間，顯然是不平等的。</p>
<p>自從婦女解放運動喊出之後，一部份婦女自覺自動的起來，要求解放，伊們要做同樣的一個人，獲得應享的權利，是：敎育平等，職業平等，政治平等。</p>
<p>到現在，婦女所要求的平等，在名義上都如願以償，達到目的，但事實上的成績，微薄得可憐！能够享平等的敎育，能够就平等的職業，能够參與平等的政治，還是少數中之少數，這是什麼原因？</p>
<p>婦女運動不能多數參加　凡是一種運動，其主要條件：　為自動，　要多數參加。自己所受的痛苦，自己最親切了解，所以需要自己起來解放，不是自動的解放，即使成功了也沒有什麼價值，所謂「趙孟能貴，趙孟能賤，」也是非常危險。多數人的參加，這運動才有力量，假使少數人起來很熱烈的幹，多數人渾渾噩噩，不知不覽，不起來協作，那是會成功，即使偶然成功了，還是不能澈底。過去解放運動，所以不能獲得完全成功，不能多數參加，也是原因之一。</p>
<p>智識不想等　莊子說：「水之積不厚，則其負大舟也無力。」我們可以知道，凡是做一件事情，要盡所負的使命，除了把學問做好智識能力提高外，別無捷徑。可是過去婦女的學力不够，也是不能諱言的事實，所以學力不够，乃是因為男女敎育沒有均等的機會，西諺有云：「不從智識基礎上求權力，權力斷斷乎得不到，僥倖得到，也斷乎保持不住。」所以婦女運動，女子先要培養實力，少作空談，從智識能力上力爭上游，務求與男子立於同等地位。過去婦女運動所以不能獲得完全成功，學力不够，也是原因之一。</p>
<p>所以，我的結論，是：要婦女運動獲得完全成功，第一要多數的婦女參加，共同恊作，第二要婦女培養智識能力，與男子立於同等地位！否則，徒有婦女解放的空名，沒有婦女解放的實際！</p>
<h3 id="c259">「土耳其」婦女的今昔 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 影天</p>
<p>那是在蘇丹（Sullans）的時候，「土耳其」的婦女差不多完全是被壓迫在男子的淫威之下的。每個年靑的少女，祇經過了所謂「敷衍」的敎育之後，便算是成年的女子了。那個時候，就應該在臉上披起薄面紗，早晚地把一個靑春的臉兒單在裏面，除去自己的父兄之外，旁的男子便休想見伊一面了。出外是少有的事，即使偶然遇到了件要事的當兒需要外出，於是就由其他的婦女伴同着出來；至於那張面紗，伊們終是那樣小心地把它掩護着，絕不讓一陣狂風把它吹開來，讓多陌生的男子瞧見。否則，也許會引想旁人的指摘：「哼！這女子多放浪哪！」</p>
<p>在家裏，伊們祇是吃吃東西，談談天。除却幾個農家女在田裏露着臉工作外，差不多的婦女在社會上辦事的就很難成功了。</p>
<p>十六七歲的時候，也是伊們結婚的時候，除去面紗的時候，照着祖先流傳下來的惡傳統，去和一個素不相識的男子結婚了。但，說來是多麼可憐哪！當伊的丈夫感到要遺棄伊時候，祇須一張休書，以及兩個人證明他是不需要伊做妻子了。分舵就在那樣的情景之下，無保障地抱着無限的悲哀，悄悄地離開了丈夫的家。</p>
<p>一個有產階級的紳士，在奴隸市塲上把一種叫做哈利葛Halaiks的女人帶回家裏，如果哈利葛生了個兒子給伊的支配下升到叫做阿達里Odalik的階級，而且成為伊主人的妻子之一了。再有，「蘇丹」時候的貴族階級的女兒，往往是嫁給低一級的兒子，很少，總督的兒子會去娶別個總督的小姐的。於此，可見當時「土耳其」婦女的生活的痛苦了。法律上更沒有女子的地位，在男子的目光中伊們就等於一個玩具了。所以，在那時候每一個多妻制的家庭裏，時候可見伊們妻妾間的大小糾紛了。</p>
<p>但是，凱末爾Kemal將軍十餘年來在舊習慣的種種障礙中打出來一個新的變理。於是，婦女問題解放了，婦女的地位也就跟着進展。同時，「土耳其」共和國也在前幾年成立了。這樣，就把一個老氣橫秋的土耳其改進得和歐洲各國相似了。</p>
<p>改革後的婦女，以前所不能做的「公務人員」，現在已完全推翻了：法庭上的女律師和女推事，報館裏的新聞記者。敎育上，也有和男子一樣的權，進中學，考大學。離婚和結婚也仿着歐西國的法律履行。至少一夫多妻制和面紗習慣等，也就完全取消了。</p>
<p>在一切新的環境裏，土耳其的女子智力和品性，受到重要影響，絕對不　　紗時代那樣的受束縛，居然自由戀愛起來，其他像家庭裏一切生活，都進步得很快</p>
<p>土耳其的婦女是完全　　急潮的解放中，曾記得一九三二的土耳其皇后哈姆Haunm當選為世界小姐，那時候，伊們是在國方魯團的婦女界中獲到一次榮譽的勝利。</p>
<p>土耳其的婦女，已是今不比昔了，伊們的改進眞快。不過，伊們是始終感謝着伊們的凱末爾。</p>

<p>— 高梗</p>
<p>早晨的鬧鐘不絕的鳴響，而女人們却又翻身睡着了，伊們比男子睡得多，而且睡得輕鬆和寗靜。</p>
<p>有不少專家研究這睡和夢的問題，結果是說，男子大半有惡夢，是因為有更多的工作和煩惱所致。</p>
<p>他們更說，無夢並不是完全睡眠的要素，但不斷的惡夢是身體不健全的象徵，他也相信，十三歲以上的人，七小時睡眠是足够了。</p>
<p>一條粗劣的毯子甚至一隻熱水袋都足以引起惡夢，有幾個非常的夢，起因於熱水袋放在脚底下。</p>
<p>我們做夢的速度很快，往往須待一小時方能陳述的事件，在夢中只是一二分鐘，當我們夢中被暗殺或遇到什麼驚怖事件，醒來一看，不過是窗牗的震響或門戶的撞聲所造成，有時竟是鐘錶的滴答聲！</p>
<p>那個專家建議，如果你不能入睡，可闔了你的眼皮向額心注視，那是人睡後眼睛所處的自然地位，做了可使心地澄淸，漸漸睡着。</p>
<p>很多偉人具有少眠的特性，他短時間的睡眠所以能恢復身心，全在於睡眠的酣暢。</p>

<p>中國古說，向以三十年為一世，而滿六十之歲，則曰花甲重周，較諸西俗之以百年為世紀者，微有出入，而却可以相互發明。蓋西說百年之為世紀，所以代表人之一「生」，吾華三十年之為世；乃以代表之一「代。Generation」考法文Sicle之漢譯作「世紀」，雖不知創作於何人，而推究其字源，則法文Siecle之一字，原脫胎於臘丁文之Saeculum，其意為世，正如臘丁文之世Aetas字可作百年解，又可作三十年解，如古詩Nuoc　terta　vivitur　aetas之所謂「三世」，即以三十年為一世，而柏樂圖Plautus與泰倫齊Terentius所作之詩，固皆以百年為世，東西兩文明古國文字之制作與推演，今竟有不期然而相脗合處，是則我中華之追崇近代先烈與先賢，正不妨援用三十年一世之說，以代西土諸邦百年一遇或二十五年一遇之盛典矣。慨自秋瑾女俠軒亭口就義之丁未六月以來，迄今將及第三十度之紀念日，國中諸大報，如能以較悠久之時晷，徵集遺事及詩文，曰不妨即以第三十年為「秋瑾年」，茲錄萬葉秋瑾年紀念詞七律兩首，以就正於海內之同志焉。詩云：</p>

<p>我先請他報告二十年來的藝術生活，她說：「我從小便喜歡美術，如今居然能繼續不斷的在藝術界找生活，成了終身的專業，我的勇氣很壯，已能把握住自己的志願了。民國十年我在美專畢業，得到安徽省欵的補助，赴法留學，進巴黎美專，四年畢業，所學稍有門徑。再升意大利學家美術學院，研究歐洲的古代美術，東方女子在那裏求學的，我還算第一人，所以師生都異眼看待。我本是苦學生，又加省欵積欠不發，有時匯來不過三五十元，不成整數的，寄宿在人家，勉强付了宿費，膳食自理，有時買幾塊麫包，只圖果腹，苦得不堪言狀。學到第三年獲得皇家獎金五千里拉，這是生平第一次榮譽。民十七年回國，任中央大學藝術科敎授六年，今　應美專之聘，乃為母校服務。我生平最喜歡遊山玩水，如浮山，九華，泰山，普陀，華山，終南，雪　，天台，雁蕩，黃山，勞山，……，都隻身往游，沿路為生，數年來作品二百餘件，定六月二日起在中華學藝社展覽，請中外各界指敎。」</p>
<p>城鄉婦女</p>
<p>女士旣到過各省游歷，農村情形，自然很明瞭，那末對於都市與鄉村的婦女，有何觀感，我這樣問她。</p>
<p>「我向來欽佩歐洲鄉村婦女的勞動精神，年來走過南北數省，纔相信我國農付婦女的勞動能力，勤儉美德，實有過之，農村裏好像無分男女，都同樣的操作，體格也同樣的堅實；婦女還得照顧家政，有時丈夫出外，她們全部負起家政和農事的責任，這是城市中人所望塵莫及的。她們只有一個缺憾，沒受敎育的機會，智識太淺薄；腦力欠敏銳；至於都市女人，尤其像上海，眞太奢侈了，過分的裝飾，浪費時間與金錢，至為可惜！我並非反對，但主張有相當的限度，否則得不償失，隨在予人以不良的印象，有些事當親自操勞，不必事事假手婢僕。還要認識自己，勿妄想，勿慕虛榮，要反省我的思想，學識，操守，能否適合現代社會？為人處世，能否有利於大衆？願今日之中國男女，達到眞平等的地位，—」這是她幾句有力的話</p>
<p>夫婦之道</p>
<p>我又問她對於夫婦之道，有何高見？她說：「夫婦之間，第一要眞誠，雙方都不容有敷衍，虛驕的脾氣，敷衍只能一時，决不能持久，猜疑更要不得，往往一事隱掩，便起隔膜，反而弄假成眞，眞的也變成假了。夫婦難免爭執，須有和平態度，事實勝於雄辯，當時讓步，事後解釋，何事不可理解。有些人家經濟分立，各不相侵，於是弊端百出，女的尙能積儲，男的易於揮霍，甚至身財名裂，不一而足；我主張經濟公開，實行家庭會計制，夫婦不能終年同居，須有數次短期的離別，這也是維持伉儷情愛的一法。」</p>
<p>最後在她書筐中檢出一幀亡命者的粉畫，凝視這個偉男子，亡命雖是亡命，而氣槪不凡，因此影印如上。</p>

<h3 id="c265">婦女產後運動法 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 郭太華</p>
<p>產婦於姙娠期中因子宮之脹大，腹肌盡量伸展；陰道肌亦因胎兒產出時將陰道過度擴大；肛門括約肌亦因產時用力，連帶將升起肌亦擴張，故產後當有腹肌永遠鬆弛，消失原有之緊張力，或腹部向下垂墜，陰道肌弛緩擴大，肛門即現脫肛及大便與屁失禁等弊病。為預防上述後患，故提示出下述之產後運動法，給產後的婦女們按法施行，蓋下述各種之產後運動法，包含有如下之利益與作用，　能恢復子宮之正常位置，及助子宮收縮復原；　能恢復肌之緊張力，腹肌不致鬆弛下垂；　恢復復臀肌腿肌力量，不致產後手足柔軟無力；　能恢復陰道肌肛門肌之緊縮力，不致陰道肌肛門鬆弛；　能改善產後弛緩之全身肌肉力量，增進產婦食慾，促進乳腺分泌。故正常產婦為健康計，為身體姿態美觀計，應按法施行；若非正常產及產後疾病會陰破裂之產婦，即須延緩開始運動日期。</p>
<p>手之運動法　產後第一日起，即可臥於床上施行，手部運動，第一星期內每日三次，每次三分鐘，以後每日四次每次五分鐘，施行時，手指與臀之肌肉須用力。</p>
<p>子宮復原運動法　整個子宮之復原，最妙莫如產婦自己哺乳，惟子宮是有游勁性的，尤其在此筋帶縮復過程中，因產臥床之姿勢，而子宮則隨時變易其位置，若長久偏臥一側，即子宮向該方面固定傾屈，成各種之子宮異位疾病，故應於產後仰臥三小時後，以後應左側右側仰臥平均輪流變換，惟每次轉側須小心緩慢，不可急動扭轉，幷須用手扶按腹部子宮，如經縫補會陰者，轉側時須先將腿併起。產後三日後，每隔十二小時反轉伏臥一次，每次一刻鐘；四日後起，於每次伏臥時，加入床上爬行運動法，第五日後再加入如甲圖之膝胸臥法，因爬行運動膝胸臥法及伏臥，均能預防子宮後傾，及對於腹肌收縮有甚大作用。</p>
<h3 id="c266">甲圖產後膝胸臥法 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>腹肌運動法　產後二日後，仰臥伸足合口，用鼻作淺吸深吸法，吸氣盡力緊縮腹部，使腹肌盡力緊縮腹部，使腹肌盡力緊縮凹下，胸部挺高擴張，由膝下丹田之力，將空氣深吸，哦出時即淺慢遲緩，腹不用力將氣呼出，施行時用一輕碗或杯放於腹上；再向左及右轉側臥，如上淺呼深吸緊縮左右側腹肌；初起早晚施行一次每次呼吸各五次；到四日後施行此法時，伸手足仰臥可改用屈膝仰臥及側臥如B圖，同時增為每隔六小時施行一次。床上爬行運動，因爬行時，胸肩手部之用力，自然令腹肌緊縮，故對於腹肌之復原功效亦甚佳；至產後第六日起，除上述運動法外，可加入上身坐起運動法如下圖，每次坐起六次，每日二回；產後十五日起再加入直立上身彎下運動法，每日二次每次三分鐘，此項運動如天氯和暖，最好在太陽光下舉行。至舊時用腹帶緊紥腹部之法，於腹肌之復元及預防腹大垂墜，今已證明無效，又有醫師云用阿波準予磨擦腹皮，有縮復腹皮縐紋之效，亦不確；故腹肌之復原，唯有施行上述各種運動法始有相當效力，不過產婦起床時，裹紥腹帶確能令腹部感覺舒快。</p>
<h3 id="c267">乙圖屈膝仰臥淺呼深吸緊縮腹肌 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>陰道肌運動法　胎兒經陰道產出時，胎頭將陰道作過度之擴張，故產婦應於產後三日起，每小時自動用力緊縮陰道肌二次，每次之緊縮時間為半分鐘至一分鐘，如此即陰道肌可緊縮復原，不致產後陰道肌鬆弛。</p>
<p>肛門肌運動法　產後三日起，每二小時自動緊縮肛門一次。</p>
<p>足部運動法　產後第三日起開始舉行，先起左足繼右足，後即兩足同起，舉行時足趾小腿大腿須用力，惟縫補會陰者，須二星期後始舉行。</p>
<h3 id="c268">可憐的西北婦女 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 滌滄</p>
<p>自從盧梭的「自然主義」，「天賦人權」的觀念，造成了法國的大革命以後，間接的引起了婦女運動；各國的婦女都相繼爭得了地位。落後的我國婦女，在民國元年以後，對於婦女的地位，也相當的有了進步。但仔細考究一下，只有極少數的「天之嬌女」才享受了些皮相的解放，多數的婦女們，却仍舊做着男子的玩物，為着牛馬的工作，度着悲慘的生活哩！</p>
<p>處在封建思想濃厚，社會不能安定，農村經濟破產的西北婦女，沉淪在舊禮敎的深坑中，緾足，穿耳，不受敎育，種種的痛苦，婚姻還是由父母之命，媒灼之言所包辦，無異是一種可以賣買的生物。伊們根本沒有人的地位，奴婢被太太毒打，媳婦受公婆虐待，妻子遭丈夫壓迫，擯棄，是公認為應該的事情。死了丈夫必須守節，殉葬，活埋小寡婦等等的慘劇，也已司空見慣，伊們自己也以為這便是「德」，舊禮敎的流毒，不知斷送了多少女靑年了。</p>
<p>至於敎育的享受，參政繼承的權利，不過是給寄生階級的千金小姐造價值，小姐們只知在學校中爭妍，在異性前奪寵；嫁了人便是人家的人，只知「三從上德」。困在鄉間的勞苦婦女，伊們連自己最低限度的牛馬生活尙且不能維持，那裏再能顧到這些問題，除了暗中羨慕伊們的虛榮之外，只有自嗟命薄而已。</p>
<p>如今有知識的東南的婦女們，大多只迷醉在燈紅酒綠的舞塲影榭，做着太太奶奶的夢幻，能有幾人還在繼續努力，準備深入勞苦婦女的羣衆中去，給伊們作響導，作先鋒，拯救那些在人間地獄中度着非人生活的婦女，為婦女大衆造幸福，而牽記著無力奮起的西北婦女呢！</p>
<h3 id="c269">致留在日本奈良的汾姊 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>—第二封信—</p>
<p>汾　三天前發的第一封信不知道已給你見到沒有？見後又有什麼感想？最好告訴我一些。</p>
<p>我不承認是一個會發牢騷的人，但自「重返祖國」以來，肚子裏的牢騷，却委實是越裝越多，大有非發不可之槪；然而我畢竟也不願意使你每次收到我一封信，便增加一重苦悶，所以今天决計把旁的一切丟開，單單告訴你一件怪有趣的風流事件，讓你好笑一笑。</p>
<p>我不是住在大姊家裏嗎？而他們所指定給我下榻的那一間却就在大姊自己的臥房後面，雖然隔着一堵牆，但仍能聽到一切的聲間。前天晚上，約莫一點鐘模樣，突然有一種很大的聲音我驚醒了。定神一聽，原來是大姊因為姊夫近來天天很遲回來，所以在和他吵鬧；這原是很平常的事情，誰討煩去聽他們。不料後來越吵越厲害，大姊也哭了，小玲也哭了，接着又聽得砰的一響，姊夫用力帶上了房門，踏着很響很粗暴的脚步衝出去了。</p>
<p>事情鬧到了這地步便不能不有人出去解勸了。可是待我忽然披衣起來，姊夫已出後門走了，祇剩大姊和小玲母子倆哭成一團。好容易才和劉媽兩人合力把他們的哭止住？於是大姊便用着切齒痛恨的表情告訴我姊夫已有了外遇，不久便要在外面實行同居，以致現在家裏經濟非常艱窘，連小玲的學費也付不出，姊夫却還是不顧，說到最後，大姊又宣佈了一條對策，便是提起訴訟。</p>
<p>我雖不是「訟則終凶」論的附和者，却也反對為着家庭的糾紛而給各報製造社會新聞資料；因此力勸大姊不要實行伊自己的主張，並允許給伊另外想一條更好的對策出來。</p>
<p>這一次睡眠，就此給他們斷送了！大姊先把一向隱藏着的許多情節逐一說給我聽，話是足足有兩淘籮，但多幾點摘出來，淸一淸眉目：</p>
<p>七個月以前，姊夫和一位姓劉的女同事發生了戀愛；</p>
<p>據大姊偵查所得，對方雖和姊夫常住一起厮混，但本性尙不十分輕狂，而且家敎也很嚴，所以兩人還不曾有過不端的行為；</p>
<p>對方要求姊夫和先和大姊離婚，然後談嫁娶；</p>
<p>姊夫確已有心要向大姊提出離婚的交涉。（未完）</p>

<p>— 南</p>
<p>立國於現世界上，空防是頗爲重要的，譬如阿比西尼亞，據說便失敗在沒有空防上，因之看見意國的飛機來了，便祗好紛紛躱藏；雖然除了飛機之外，「灌輸文明者」好像還有毒瓦期彈，像薰蚊子似的把「野蠻民族」薰倒，但總之，吃虧於沒有空防也是頗爲不少的。</p>
<p>說到切身一點，那麼最好看看一二八之役，敵人的飛機在閘北的上空生蛋，蓬的一聲，黑烟四起，繼之便一陣火光，在閘北的小民當然是哭聲遍地，而租界上却小然，很有幾個「高等華人」開了大飯店的房間，打牌之外兼以作「隔岸觀火」的瞭望台。那時候國際大飯店尙沒有，不然，我想在國際大飯店上凌空俯瞰，一定是更爲親切，好看的。固然，國際大飯店有沒有和「難民」並沒多大關係，除了使「隔岸觀火」者看得更爲高興之外，難民的生命財產還是會被燒夷彈，轟炸彈毁得一乾凈的，不過由此也足證中國的空防並不健全，需要好好地建立起來。</p>
<p>至於跳舞救國，那是說着玩的，說不定發明這四個字的人還是存有諷刺作用。不然，禁舞的聲浪也早就不會有了，可見跳舞這玩意兒於「社會安寗，及整個國家民族之前途」終究有弊害。但也並不盡然，例如航空捐，在舞塲裏便按位徵收，但這當然是有寓徵於禁的深意在內。現在用遊藝來擴大航空宣傳，這自然是更好方法。因爲在這色情的上海，用「草裙舞」等來號召，一定收效甚巨的；從前的水災遊藝會不是用「花選」來號召過的嗎？所以門票雖貴，各界人士還是踴躍購買，同時足見人民贊助擴大航空救國運動之熟忱，原是「良有已也」的。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3 id="c271">航空遊藝會在國際大飯店 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>——是夜禮服的大集合</p>
<p>在咱們的「親善」的强鄰剛以巨量的戰鬥機挪着五百磅炸彈把中國炸個半死的當兒，意大利的烏鴉般的飛機把阿比西尼亞炸成一片焦土。這時候，咱們的中國似乎在覺醒起來了。</p>
<p>工人，小學生，商人，他們知道「航空救國」，他們能够做到的力量，祇是把自己的零用錢積省下來，把幾個銅子集合起來，成爲一個整數，去買飛機捐給政府，他們都懷着火般熟的心，雖然，在舉行一個什麼典禮後，還是把這些飛機擱起來，可是他們還是深信着的，他們的飛機總有一天會把敵人趕跑了的</p>
<p>從「航空救國」身上發出來的而於「救國」無關的事情太多了。最近我們又看到了舉行在很高很高的國際大飯店摩天樓上的「航空遊藝大會」。</p>
<p>自然，誰都應高興的。在航空還是相當幼雅的中國，誰對航空發生着盛大的興趣。我相信，要是這航空遊藝大會如果不是放在高高的摩天樓上邊，在一個曠野上舉行，一定會有廣大的航空熱的民衆去踴躍參加的。</p>
<p>自己正同其它航空熱的民衆一樣，很想知道不是工人階級的「航空救國」是不是也同他們那樣的。他們一定在心里頭喊着：「為什麼要放在十三層樓上面」舉行呢？爲什麼隔離我們呢？」</p>
<p>「李大超先生沒有空，他說拿幾本書給你們看看」</p>
<p>「請你把這幾本書退回去，我們不是看書來的，是採訪新聞來的。你再去問問他，招待不招待記者」？</p>
<p>那位有訓練的一六五號僕歐站着不動，他的臉色沉下去：</p>
<p>「他說沒有空，當然是不招待」！</p>
<p>「我們看那位有訓練的僕歐很像是李大超先生的全權代表那樣的把我們拒絕了。我們要回名片，沒有拿他好意給我們的書，走了。</p>
<p>我們在想着，想想看，爲什麼拒絕了我們呢？難道「航空遊藝會」祇是高等紳士們的娛樂嗎？它和「航空救國」沒有關係嗎？它不要廣大的宣傳嗎？</p>
<p>可是，我們怎樣吿訴讀者呢？我們所看到的祇是銀蛇樣的電燈，紅燈籠，黑牌汽車，應夜服，有訓練的僕歐的二種不同的臉色，幾本黃面子的書。</p>
<p>如果，讀者想要知道遊藝會的內容那我祇有根據他們的宣傳稿抽象的來寫一下：</p>
<p>在那有色的燈光下，紳士們半醉半做作的臉上，汗水把他們臉上的粉質洗去，他們眼睛細了，手顫了。多少掩在眼鏡後面的眼眸子，突出來似的望着中央沒遮攔的肉體在燈光下變成一隻跳蚤，使紳士們混身的發癢……</p>
<p>讀者們！×小姐表演的「草裙舞」，也許比我所寫的也許還要動人，也許我所寫的不準確？但，我有什麼方法把凖確的新聞吿訴讀者呢？</p>
<p>想到這里，我覺得把這「航空遊藝會」的情形寫給大家看看眞是太需要了。就在　樣熱鬧的情緒下，邀了各報的記者同去了。在途上，我已打算回來在紙上把他們捐多少飛機的好消息吿訴讀者。</p>
<p>狠興奮的在深藍的夜色下趕了去。遼遠的便看見黑色的國際飯店的高厦，那長長的一串電燈，像一條火赤煉似的。門前，觸目的放着二盞舊色結親用的紅燈籠，這是航空大會呵！</p>
<p>汽車不停地在門口停下，夜禮服的朋友也跟着夜禮服之後進去。看他們挾着花樣的女人的粉臂高傲地踏進電梯</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，當我們也耍踏進去的時侯，國際飯店的經過訓練的一六五號僕歐把我們擋住了。我們就把自己的名片拿出來，呌他去報李大超先生說，我們是來採訪新聞的，僕歐拿着名片上去，我們在門邊的沙發上等着回音。</p>
<p>坐在我們旁邊沙發上的，是一對穿着夜禮服洋夫婦。一位穿夜禮服彎着像蝦那樣腰的我們同胞，正堆滿了笑容對這對洋夫婦說着流利的英語，從他身上發出的香水精氣息，和從洋太太身上發出西洋人種特有的氣息混在一起，就使人心癢癢的。</p>
<p>我站起來，把視錢注視到電梯口，電梯正在忙碌地幹着搬運夜禮服的工作。有訓練的僕歐對着夜禮服的主人誠恐招待不週地做着敬重的樣子。</p>
<p>有一輛電梯，把剛才拿我們名片上去的有訓練的一六五號僕歐送了下來。他手是拿着的銀盆子上面，堆着幾本黃面子的書。他走上來，臉上已沒有笑容：</p>
<h3 id="c272">松花江上 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 丁里</p>
<p>由西比利亞吹來尖峭而夾雜着雪花和冰屑的風，憤怒的咆哮着掠過了這寂寞的夜之原野，森林，以及疎朗的村舍……</p>
<p>幾尺厚的深雪在地上堆高了，豐滿而細膩，看起來像是在微微地流動着似的；銀白的顏色在大地上的每一個角落里都發出幽鬱地光亮，這光亮反映到墨黑的天上就像是秋天早上的薄薄地晨霧，這點淡淡地光亮就流動在這黑暗的原野上，它代替了星月的照明的任務，而不致使這豐裕的原野墮入了黑暗的深淵</p>
<p>森林，一望無邊際的森林，默默地矗立着，龐大的樹頭糢糊在幽暗的空中，迎着風的方向，樹幹上寫上了極北的雪的詩句，它吟咏着其中的辛酸。遠遠地森林的左後方蜿延着悠長的山脈，俊偉的輪廓渲染了一層模糊地濃厚的夜色，好像是有些萎縮，又彷彿要挺起了堅壯的胸膛與黑暗在開始了英勇的搏擊。在它下邊便劃開了那條北國的河流—松花江。</p>
<p>在春天，在夏天，在秋天，（松花江像是由一個强壯的孩子漸漸地長成了個英偉的丈夫。）它吼呌着在河床內翻騰着，它向美麗的河岸洒着眼淚，在它的心頭是埋着些傷心的事蹟，事蹟是每天在加增了記錄，每伴記事都咬傷了它的心，它憤怒，它悲泣，它哭號，它要翻上天去，把傷心的記事傾吐給人類，它要求能有一個公平的裁判。……</p>
<p>冬天，北國的寒冷之冬，松花江的洪流給堅厚的冰塊牢牢的封住了，在冰塊下的聲音便不給人聽見了，彷彿已經給人們忘掉了。——封凍了的松花江上已經厚厚地蓋上了雪被，給地面已經是稍有差異了。</p>
<p>狗，幾隻軍用狗，貪婪的抽打着鼻子，吃力的拔着腿跑向松花江的堅硬的河身奔去，緊跟着是幾輛載重的騾車，遠遠地，像酒徒似的搖榥着身子，艱難的爬過來，雪被車輪帶得撲魯撲魯的低啞的饗着，響聲漸漸地近了。</p>
<p>沒有其他的動靜，武裝的軍人斜掛着槍枝，守在車門口兒，口里亮着香烟的火光，有的瞌睡着，有的猙獰地由皮帽下向遠方投射着銳利的眼睛，他們不談。一句話，默默地等候着將要發生的事情。跑在遠方的狗不時的狂吠着，那聲音彷彿隔着一層霧似的有些發啞。</p>
<p>一會兒，他們（連狗）停在松花江上，騾馬發出幾聲沈悶的長嘶，之後，武裝的軍人們生氣勃勃地躍上了車子，打開了車門，拖下了好多靑年人，他們：裸着半身，被朦着眼睛，堵着嘴，反剪着兩手，脚上帶着鐐，他們踉蹌地跌在地上。</p>
<p>武裝軍人掃除了冰上的雪，又用鐵鏟把堅硬的冰塊打成了洞，——在下邊衝出了松花江的吼聲。在這聲中武裝軍人的鋒利的短刀砍在被綁着的靑年人的頭上，肩際，或刺入了胸部和隨便什麼地方……靑年入流出了血，他們沒法喊呌，沒法抗鬥，只痛苦的顫動着身子，狠勁兒的頓着脚……。於是他們就被投入了那預先打開的泳上的洞里，沒入了松花江。江水憤怒的躍了出來……</p>
<p>撲通！撲通……靑年們懷着血的創傷投入松花江的懷抱了！</p>
<p>像是怕江水由洞里整個兒奔出的一樣，寒冷又凍封了那洞口，雪壓住了靑年人的血，一切恢復了不久以前的形狀，像是沒有發生過什麼事情的一樣。……</p>
<p>這，只有松花江明白！他擁抱着，用冰冷的嘴唇吻着靑年們的僵硬的帶着刀傷的屍身。</p>
<p>由西比利亞吹來的尖峭而夾雜着雪花和冰屑的風，憤怒的咆哮着掠過了這寂寞的夜之原野，森林，以及疎朗的村舍。……</p>
<p>大地，漸漸地要趨於晴明了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Newly Added Japanese Troops in North China Arrived in Tianjin in Large Numbers Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Old and New Barracks in Tianjin are Full; Further Arrivals are Planned Using Other Means; Headquarters Staff Officers Held a Meeting</p>
<p>Imai Denies the Rumor that New Japanese Troops will be Stationed in Nanyuan</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A new contingent of Japanese troops for North China arrived at Tanggu on the morning of the 29th, aboard the high-speed transport ships "Sanmeiwei Maru" and others. They disembarked at noon and boarded six trains. The first train was full of supplies and arrived in Tianjin at 4 PM, transporting them into the Haiguangsi Barracks. The second train arrived in Tianjin at 6:45 PM, where staff officers such as Ishii and Ikeda, along with two senior adjutants, Otake and Kawada, as well as several hundred Japanese veterans and Japanese residents, welcomed them at the station with flags. This train carried 120 cavalrymen, 120 horses, and 12 artillery pieces, as well as countless ammunition. They immediately entered the Haiguangsi Barracks. At 8:15 PM in the evening, the second troop train carrying 500 infantrymen and artillerymen arrived in Tianjin, greeted as before. Among them, 150 were transported on the same train at 8:30 PM to Tongzhou via Peiping. The rest disembarked in Tianjin, with some entering the Haiguangsi Barracks and others heading to the new barracks in Dongjuzi. The third troop train arrived in Tianjin around 11:30 PM, carrying about 500 infantry and special forces, who will be stationed at the Dongjuzi Barracks. There are still more than 500 infantry and artillerymen, as well as 80 cavalry, who took two special trains from Tanggu directly to Yuguan and Qinhuangdao in the afternoon. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) With the increase of Japanese troops in Tianjin, both the Haiguangsi Barracks and the new barracks in Dongjuzi are overcrowded. From the 29th, staff officers with the rank of Major and below from the headquarters have been residing in hotels in the Japanese concession such as Xilai, Yamato, Fu Ying, and Tokiwa. The new troops are stationed in Ping-Tong, Fengtai, and Changxindian, totaling 2,000 men. A total of 3,000 are at Haiguangsi Barracks and the new barracks in Dongjuzi. The remaining troops are stationed at various guard posts in Yutian, Tanggu, Changli, and Aomen. To facilitate communication between the Tianjin Japanese Army and the Dongjuzi Barracks, it has been decided to use ten heavy-duty trucks to transport supplies back and forth. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As of the night of the 29th, a total of seven batches of Japanese troops had arrived in North China, numbering over 4,000 men. Within June, they plan to continue to arrive gradually using other methods to avoid attracting the attention of various countries, including motorized chemical warfare units, in order to complete the organizational structure of a full division. Approximately 300 troops from the Tianjin garrison are due to rotate out, scheduled to return home on the 3rd. Furthermore, the question of command over the Japanese troops at the Great Wall is currently a point of contention between the Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison. The North China Army hopes to have them under their unified command, and it is said that the military headquarters is currently studying the matter. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The newly arrived Japanese troops who landed at Tanggu this afternoon will arrive in Tianjin, with about five or six hundred of them scheduled to come to Peiping from Tianjin tomorrow morning. Some will remain in Peiping, while others will proceed to Tongxian to be stationed. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Japanese sources, the Japanese gendarmerie in Peiping and Tianjin will be expanded into a general unit, with Xing Sheng internally designated as the commander of the unit. Branch headquarters will be established in Peiping and Tianjin, and detachments will be established in places such as Beining, Tongbao, etc., to handle affairs in those areas. Furthermore, two platoons of recruits from the Kayashima training camp will be incorporated into the gendarmerie, and their authority will be more stringent than before. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Four ships transporting Japanese rotation troops arrived in Tanggu yesterday. The cavalry units disembarked shortly after, and the first batch arrived in Tianjin by train at 6:30 PM today. The infantry units spent the night on board the ships and will arrive by train tonight at 8:20 PM. The majority of them will be stationed in the newly built barracks near the International Race Course. The remaining troops, such as the tank units, will proceed directly to the Japanese barracks in Haiguangsi in the Japanese concession. There are also two additional trains, one carrying Japanese troops to Peiping, which will arrive in Tianjin at 11:20 PM tonight, and another carrying some Japanese soldiers to Yuguan. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops who arrived in Tianjin today will have two platoons coming to Peiping tomorrow morning. According to Japanese military attache Imai, once the redeployment is complete, there will be 1,000 Japanese soldiers stationed in Peiping, compared to an average of only 300 in previous years. Barracks are currently under construction in Fengtai, and once completed, the Japanese troops currently stationed in Tongzhou will be transferred there. Imai denied that barracks are being built in Tongzhou and Changxindian, and also denied the rumor that Japanese troops intend to occupy the Chinese barracks in Nanyuan. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 7:00 AM on the 29th, the staff of the Tianjin Garrison, centered around Chief of Staff Nagami, held an important discussion on the current situation at the Zhang Garden residence. After the meeting, Nagami went to Peiping at 9:00 AM and visited Song Zheyuan along with Matsumuro, and also met with Xiao Zhenying in Peiping, returning to Tianjin at 7:00 PM in the evening. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Garrison Chief of Staff Nagami Toshihide arrived in Peiping from Tianjin at 11:38 AM on the 29th, and immediately visited Matsumuro and others for discussions. He returned to Tianjin at 5:10 PM in the afternoon. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai Takeo, Japanese military officers Iida and Ikeda from the Tianjin Garrison are in Peiping for sightseeing and have no other missions. The second batch of new Japanese troops is expected to arrive in Peiping tomorrow morning. The existing Japanese barracks are no longer sufficient to accommodate them, so it is necessary to find a suitable location for them to be stationed. However, the foreign reports that they will be stationed in Nanyuan are untrue. Fengtai is one of the candidate locations under consideration. Whether or not other locations need to be sought is still unknown. The rumor that the Japanese army will select a site to establish a repair shop is inaccurate. Small-scale repairs can be handled by each unit this month, and there is no need for a large-scale repair shop yet. He is currently investigating the incident on the 27th where a Japanese person was beaten to death by soldiers outside Chongwenmen Inner Street. This is a judicial matter, and he does not want to express his opinion as an outsider. The date of Commander Tashiro's arrival in Peiping is undecided. Chief of Staff Nagami's visit today is for inspection purposes and has no other mission. Ambassador Kawagoe is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on June 20 to assume his new post in China.

<h3 id="e13">North China after the Strengthening of Japanese Garrison <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>On the one hand, Japanese diplomacy towards China promotes a unified policy, speaking of friendship, cooperation, and adjustment of diplomatic relations. On the other hand, it actively expands the garrison in North China and allows ronin to smuggle. In fact, it is still a double-dealing approach. Even if the responsible authorities in our country express their utmost sincerity in seeking peace, until their lips are worn out and their hearts are revealed, they cannot change its established policy and relax its policy of encroachment. Now, the one bearing the brunt is of course North China. Since the Japanese army's strengthened troops successively arrived in Peiping and Tianjin, the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic negotiations have come to a halt, and the cancellation of the puppet organization in Eastern Hebei has ultimately become an illusion. Japanese soldiers are being stationed along the railways within Hebei Province, and forts are being built in places such as Gubeikou. Looking ahead, it is truly chilling.</p>
<p>In response to our country's protest against increasing troops in North China, Japan replied that "the Japanese side, in view of the current unstable situation in North China, deems it absolutely necessary to increase its military strength in order to ensure that the Japanese garrison can fulfill its mission without regrets. This is based on the Boxer Protocol and does not violate the precedents. The number of troops to be increased will be limited to the absolute minimum necessary and will not threaten our country or infringe upon our rights." One wonders how the Japanese view the Boxer Protocol and precedents. This point has been discussed in detail in our newspaper before and will not be repeated here. As for the reason of the unstable situation in North China, the communist bandits who have been moving around in Shanxi have already been eliminated, and the Hebei-Chahar defense against communism is extremely thorough, so there is no excuse. In addition, the instability in North China, such as rampant smuggling and rampant ronin, where exactly does the driving force come from? According to common sense, it is only right for our country to increase troops to maintain order, but the Japanese side's increase of troops will only increase the elements of instability.</p>
<p>Recently, Japan's actions in North China have focused on both economic development and military expansion, with a subtle effect of mutual cooperation and promotion. Economic development is carried out by the South Manchuria Railway, which is centered on purchasing cotton mills in North China, promoting cotton planting, developing coal mines, building the Cangshi Railway, and planning highway transportation. Then, military force is used as a backing to threaten and coerce, so that economic development can proceed more smoothly and unimpeded. The usual practice of Japanese diplomacy is to obtain the greatest benefit with the least sacrifice. Now, it considers that the time has come for customary practices in North China. According to news from Tianjin, the new commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, Tashiro, convened a meeting of cadres to convey the new plan issued by the military headquarters. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also plans to send Kuwabara, the director of the East Asia Bureau, to North China to carry out concrete adjustments to North China's work. All these facts deserve our special attention.</p>
<p>In short, North China in the current stage cannot be remedied by empty words and the application of diplomatic theories, because the crux of the problem lies with Japan, not with us. We still hope that the Japanese government and people will make a final effort to awaken the warlords so that the entire adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations can be successful and establish a grand plan for permanent peace in East Asia. At the same time, we firmly believe that there is no other way to save the country except through self-reliance and hard work. And the only condition for self-reliance is that the country must first be united in step and give full play to its overall strength to ensure the integrity of our land, the existence of sovereignty, and the safety of the nation. In other words, the whole country should be sincerely united, and everyone should fulfill their responsibility to save the country, not seeking temporary peace or shrinking back in the slightest, and strive to break through the current difficulties in order to reach a bright path.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) An Qi'er, Director of the General Inspection Office for Preventing Road Transport Smuggling, accompanied by Li Tonghua, Deputy Director of the Office, and other inspection personnel, took the Jinpu train north from Beijing on the 29th to inspect along the way and will also meet with personnel from the railway bureaus along the way to discuss the establishment of inspection offices at key stations and cooperation between customs and railway authorities in combating smuggling. The location of the General Inspection Office will be determined after the inspection is completed. In addition, the original Provisional Regulations on the Inspection of Imported Goods for Transportation stipulated that the types of imported goods to be inspected should be determined by the Ministry of Finance at any time. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has stipulated the types of imported goods to be inspected and will be announced within days. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Zuomin, the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Investigation of the Xuzhou Customs, accompanied by inspectors Liu Yihong, Hu Xueyuan, and Han Deqing, arrived in Xuzhou from Beijing on the morning of the 29th and set up an inspection office at the Jinlong Hotel. They also requested assistance from the Xuzhou military police and railway authorities to notify the stations on both lines to detain all smuggled goods, investigate the consignees, and punish them according to regulations, or transport them to Beijing and Shanghai for sealing. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Ministry of Railways sent a telegram to Tianjin on the 29th regarding assistance in combating smuggling on the Beining Railway, ordering the railway to do its utmost to assist under appropriate procedures. In view of the fact that ronin have been forcibly transporting smuggled goods on Jinpu passenger trains to the south in recent days, the railway fears that the implementation of the new anti-smuggling law will lead to conflicts and has replied to the customs that it will be implemented leniently. Currently, smuggled goods are being transported directly to Jinan, Qingdao, Dezhou, and points south, as if entering no man's land, and the situation is serious. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Sixty tons of smuggled white sugar, totaling 720 bags, were transferred from the Jinpu Railway to the Longhai Railway on the afternoon of the 28th. The Chief of Inspection Li Tonghua, who was sent to Jinan by the Taxation Department, learned of this while passing through Xuzhou and immediately ordered the Xuzhou station chief to detain the sugar and hand it over to Director Wang, who arrived in Xuzhou on the 29th, for handling. Wang has telegraphed Beijing for instructions. The consignor of the sugar is Tongdechang in Jinan, and the consignee is San Cheng Company in Guide. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Vice Minister Horiuchi's reply was the same as last time, stating that there was no such thing as smuggling in North China. The protests lodged by the United Kingdom and the United States regarding the smuggling problem in North China against the Japanese government prove that the United Kingdom and the United States do not understand the truth about East Asia.

<p>(Nanjing) This year's silkworm harvest in Zhejiang Province is better, but when the cocoons were put on the market, the silk prices suddenly changed. The price on the European and American markets fell from 760 yuan to 650 yuan, causing the silk market to stagnate for several days. According to investigations by relevant parties, the reason for the decline in silk prices is due to Japanese silk manipulation. Their country's production accounts for five-sixths of the world's silk production, so there is a purpose in suddenly manipulating the market at the time of the new silk harvest.

<p>(Hankou) The 56th section of the fourth construction section of the Yaodi embankment collapsed at 10:00 PM on the 26th due to the submersion of the water barrier dam. The breach reached 300 meters. A few civilian laborers drowned, and the rest managed to escape. The floodwaters rushed directly into Tianmen and Hanchuan, and many villages and fields are reported to have been flooded. Civilian houses outside the embankment were completely flooded, and refugees are awaiting rescue by boat. The breach is now widening and has reached 600 meters. Most of the laborers have fled. It has been found that sections one, two, and three of the entire embankment are generally completed and there is no cause for concern, but the fourth construction section, which was contracted for repair, has collapsed, ruining the work. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The reporter inspected the breach of the Xiangdi embankment on the 29th. The area is the 55th, 56th, and 57th sections, nearly 1,000 meters long. Tens of miles outside the embankment is a vast expanse of water. Most of the area inside the embankment is also flooded. Refugees climbed onto roofs and trees, calling for help. Xiong Daochen, the magistrate of Zhongxiang County, urgently telegraphed the provincial government today to report the disaster and request relief. The disaster situation in Tianmen and Hanchuan is unknown. The fourth construction section has a lot of sand and the construction is not solid, with many cracks.

<p>Sanctions Not Withdrawn, Only Option is Forced Withdrawal from League</p>
<p>Exercising Skill, Releasing New Delhi Air</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi informed British Foreign Secretary Eden today, guaranteeing that Italy has no intention of aggression against British interests in the Near East and elsewhere, and expressed the deep hope that British-Italian relations will reach a good state. It is widely believed that the Ambassador also stated clearly that if the League of Nations continues sanctions against Italy, then Italy cannot put forward any political suggestions regarding the Mediterranean Agreement, and will seriously consider the issue of whether to remain in the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi issued a statement to Foreign Secretary Eden, saying that if the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy cannot be lifted after the Executive Yuan holds an extraordinary meeting on the 16th of next month, then Italy will immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. Italian sources here recently denied this, saying that Grandi's visit to Eden this time aimed to find ways to bring Britain and Italy closer together. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Rome: Political figures say that Italy's diplomatic position is completely tied to the situation in Geneva. Since the League of Nations has declared Italy an aggressor, it is currently difficult to go back on its word, and Italy understands that its position is quite difficult. The only option now is to reorganize the League of Nations and amend Article 16 of the Covenant, which concerns sanctions. This is the only honest way to communicate the feelings of Italy and the League of Nations. If Italy is forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, it may temporarily adopt a policy of isolation and immediately move closer to Germany. At that time, the League of Nations' life may inevitably come to an end. However, Germany is now seeking to approach Britain. If Italy withdraws from the League, it will only cause a fatal wound to the League of Nations, which is not enough to interrupt the relationship between Britain and Germany. Therefore, Italy is currently hesitating carefully about the move to withdraw from the League and has not yet made a decision. It has not yet been decided whether Italy will send personnel to attend the League of Nations Executive Yuan meeting in the middle of next month, but if the Abyssinian representative is still present at the meeting, the Italian representative will under no circumstances be willing to attend.

<p>Expressing Willingness to Actively Negotiate to Resolve the Abyssinian Problem</p>
<p>(London) Italian Ambassador Grandi had a discussion with Foreign Secretary Eden this morning. It is reported that Grandi explained to Eden that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini repeatedly explained Italy's intentions towards Britain to British newspaper reporters (referring to Italy's not threatening any part of the British Empire, i.e., Egypt, Sudan, and the Near East). Italy's guarantees can only be offered to this extent, and no further. If the League of Nations Executive Yuan decides to only temporarily maintain the current sanctions after the meeting in the middle of next month, Italy does not intend to withdraw from the League of Nations. But if the implementation period of the sanctions extends to the League of Nations General Assembly in September of this year, then the withdrawal from the League will become a reality. Eden replied that Britain is unwilling to haggle over the issue of sanctions, and there are no specific suggestions that can be put forward regarding British-Italian relations at this time. Responsible persons believe that the current sanctions will likely be maintained after the League of Nations Executive Yuan meeting, and then Britain and Italy will actively negotiate between June and September to seek mutual rapprochement and achieve the purpose of lifting sanctions. This procedure is quite favored by financial circles, but leftists advocate maintaining the current sanctions and say that Italy is waiting for foreign countries, especially Britain and France, to lend it a large sum for the development of Abyssinia. Therefore, if Italy is to be pressured, at least financial sanctions should continue to be implemented. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Italian Ambassador Grandi visited Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday morning. The Daily Express recently published some of the content of the conversation, saying: "Ambassador Grandi informed Foreign Secretary Eden of the oral statement of Prime Minister Mussolini, saying that if the League of Nations does not lift sanctions against Italy, then Italy will immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. Eden believes that lifting or tightening sanctions is a matter for all member states of the League of Nations, and Britain is not in a position to put forward a concrete answer." The Daily Mail reported that Grandi declared to Eden that Britain and Italy have always had good relations, and Italy is now willing to restore them and is willing to cooperate with Britain, and also stated that Britain and Italy should immediately conduct negotiations to resolve the Abyssinian problem.

<p>Being Realistic, Ensuring the Safety of Abyssinia's Borders</p>
<p>Resolutely Resisting Any Intervention</p>
<p>(London) According to a dispatch from the Daily Telegraph's Rome correspondent yesterday, since the Italian government announced the annexation of Abyssinia, it has considered itself to have complete sovereignty without any doubt. If anyone intervenes and forces Italy to withdraw this claim, the entire Italian nation will rise up and resist it. Italy's policy towards Abyssinia is based on pragmatism, and the objectives it seeks are no more than four: Ensuring the safety of Abyssinia's borders, Ensuring the safety of Italian communications with East Africa, Maintaining peace in Europe, Restoring its reputation in spirit (i.e., dissatisfaction with the League of Nations' condemnation). As far as the sanctions issue is concerned, Italian economists say that Italy will not feel the pain unless the sanctions are maintained for a year and a half or two years. The correspondent also said, "If the sanctions can be lifted at this time, then Italy will participate in any committees organized by the League of Nations that are used to promote a collective security system. In short, it is clear that Prime Minister Mussolini intends to reach an understanding with the major European powers, and the next few weeks (referring to the League of Nations Executive Yuan meeting in mid-June) are the key to the situation."

<p>League of Nations Executive Yuan to Meet Next Month</p>
<p>Expected Not to Take Decisive Steps</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to well-informed sources in the League of Nations, when the Executive Yuan meets in the middle of next month, Britain and France will advocate temporarily maintaining the current sanctions. The Executive Yuan will not take decisive steps on the two issues of whether sanctions should be maintained and whether Italy's seizure of Abyssinia should be recognized. Instead, a definite decision will be made after the League of Nations General Assembly holds a public meeting in September to discuss the matter. At this time, Ecuador and Guatemala in South America have withdrawn from the sanctions line, and Chile will probably follow suit. In addition to the Italian-Abyssinian problem, the Locarno case will also be discussed by the Executive Yuan, but Germany may not submit an answer on the British problem at that time, so the Executive Yuan cannot take a decision. The situation of the Executive Yuan meeting can be said to be only like this at this time. All other speculations are too early to say because it is not yet known what attitude the future French cabinet will adopt. Rumors that the League of Nations Executive Yuan will postpone the meeting at the request of the current French government have been denied by responsible sources. At the moment the French cabinet is in the process of changing, and the current government is not in a position to launch anything. As for the new cabinet, it can be organized and established on the 4th of next month, and the French representative can arrive in Geneva at the same time as other representatives, and there is no need to postpone the meeting.

<p>(London) Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty Stanley said in the House of Commons tonight when discussing the additional budget of £10.3 million for the new naval construction program that the opposition party expressed regret over the need to increase naval spending. He sympathized as well. Since the Great War, the British government has made constant efforts to seek an agreement on arms limitation, but has not achieved greater success. Britain is building more battleships, not to deal with any country. However, the fact proves that Germany, France, and Italy are now building capital ships, which shows that the era of battleships has not yet passed. Britain must quickly replenish its aging fleet of battleships. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Proclamation Read on St. James's Balcony</p>
<p>Guards in Shining Armor, Solemn Ceremony</p>
<p>The proclamation that King Edward VII of England will be crowned on May 12, 1937 was read today on the balcony of St. James's Palace according to ancient custom. The royal coat of arms hung high on the bell tower, where the King resided. Officials gathered on the platform, including military officers in shining armor, those who wore the armor of Edward VI (1547-1557). The King's Hand Grenade Guards were lined up in the garden below the platform, mixed with the military band of the Coldstream Guards. With three military bugle calls, the Grand Master of Ceremonies Sir Horatio Halliston read the proclamation. The text of the proclamation was about a yard wide. The knight finished reading it in seven minutes, shouting "God Save the King." The audience did not respond with cheers, apparently because they were awed by the solemnity of the ceremony. When the knight read the proclamation, a gramophone and a loudspeaker were placed in front of him so that the audience could hear it. After the ceremony, the officials marched in formation to the Royal Exchange, where the proclamation was read again. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Why Not Throw Them Into the Fire to Make Them Ascend to the Kingdom of Heaven</p>
<p>London: Today, when a charity auction was held to raise money for disabled children, there was a business card written by playwright George Bernard Shaw, which stated that the current world is not suitable for children to live in. Why not let these disabled children have fun for one day, and then, while they are sleeping, throw them into the fire and make them ascend to the Kingdom of Heaven? This business card was then purchased by a person for 10 pounds and was ordered to be burned on the spot. (National News dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Most of it Comes from China</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a report released today by the Chemical Testing Department of the Ministry of Commerce, American industrial consumption of tung oil has increased by 70% since 1931. The total consumption in 1935 was 127,600,000 pounds. This tung oil comes almost entirely from China, with only a small amount supplied by the Gulf Coast of the United States, where a tung oil industry is gradually emerging. Taking the average price of 18 cents per pound this year as the standard for calculation, the tung oil used by the American paint industry in 1936 accounts for about 75% of the total amount. The total consumption in 1935 was 98,440,000 pounds. The oilcloth industry ranked second, with consumption in 1935 of 10,391,000 pounds, a significant increase compared to 7,300,000 pounds in 1932. The tung oil used by the pigment industry last year totaled 2,003,000 pounds, compared to 713,000 pounds in 1932. In 1935, the consumption of other industries totaled 10,756,000 pounds, compared to 7,892,000 pounds in 1932. The amount of tung oil used by the electrical industry, the wood board industry, waterproofing compounds, car oilcloth, and raincoat manufacturing is also considerable.

<p>(Geneva) During the League of Nations Opium Committee's discussion on the current situation of narcotics in China, both the American representative, Fowler, and the Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, criticized Japan for failing to take adequate measures to prohibit Japanese and Korean individuals from trafficking drugs. This discussion concluded last night. Before the adjournment of the committee, Hu Shih-tse expressed his gratitude to the governments of all countries for jointly urging Japan to suppress drug traffickers, and stated that the Chinese government would do everything in its power to eliminate this scourge. He then mentioned Fowler's candid remarks, hoping that if the U.S. government obtained information similar to that revealed by its representative, it would immediately notify the Chinese government. (Reuter's dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee on Opium Problems of the League of Nations continued its meeting today. The American representative, Fowler (Assistant Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department), delivered a speech, once again strongly condemning the activities of Japanese individuals trafficking drugs within Chinese territory. He stated that in the Hongkou area of Shanghai alone, there were no fewer than thirty to forty opium dens, and that the Japanese authorities were fully aware of this but had never taken measures to prohibit them. It is generally believed that the Opium Committee will once again petition the Japanese government to take effective measures to punish its citizens trafficking drugs in North China. It is reported that the British and American governments have already notified the Japanese government of this matter, urging them to pay attention to it. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee on Opium Problems of the League of Nations continued its meeting today. First, the Portuguese representative, Vasconcelos, spoke, strongly requesting the Japanese representative to once again ask his government to take effective measures to curb the drug trafficking activities of its citizens. He stated that the Japanese representative had, nine years prior, already declared in the name of his government that they were willing to take effective action. The Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, then spoke, saying, "It must not be forgotten that a portion of Chinese territory is not managed by our own government officials. However, our government has taken all necessary measures within its scope of duty for opium suppression work. If the Japanese government could restrain its citizens from engaging in drug trafficking, it would be a great benefit to opium suppression work, and the two nations, China and Japan, would also understand each other better." Thereupon, the Japanese representative, Ito, stood up and replied, stating that his government had not been lenient towards drug traffickers. If the measures previously taken proved ineffective, then other measures would be adopted upon verification. He also stated that his government genuinely intended to eradicate illegal trade. At this point, the American representative, Fowler, questioned him and once again criticized the Japanese for trafficking drugs in Shanghai. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Minister of Public Works Transferred to Colonial Secretary <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Belongs to the National Labour Party</p>
<p>Familiar with the Situation in Palestine</p>
<p>(London) The order to transfer Ormsby-Gore, the Minister of Public Works, to the position of Colonial Secretary has been officially announced. However, the selection of a successor for the Minister of Public Works has not yet been determined. It is likely that Lord Trawell, the Under-Secretary of Education, will be promoted. Because Trawell belongs to the National Labour Party, and the current cabinet is advocating "national unity," with the departure of one National Labour Party cabinet member (Thomas), it is fitting that another National Labour Party cabinet member be appointed, so that the balance of power among the political parties can be maintained. It is reported that the newly appointed Colonial Secretary, Ormsby-Gore, previously served as an administrative officer in Palestine in 1918, and is extremely familiar with the special circumstances there. In 1922, he was transferred to become the Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office. When the Labour Party cabinet was formed in 1924, he resigned due to differing party affiliations. In 1929, when former Prime Minister MacDonald formed the National Cabinet, Gore made a comeback and resumed his original position. In 1931, he was promoted to Postmaster General, and in the same year, he was transferred to Minister of Public Works. In 1932, he represented Britain at the League of Nations Mandates Commission. Now that the Palestine issue has suddenly become tense, it is necessary to have a high-ranking official familiar with the local situation to cope with the difficulties and immediately resolve the disputes. The reason why Gore was able to quickly succeed Thomas as Colonial Secretary is likely due to this. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Jerusalem Today, Arabs staged riots throughout Palestine. Bombing incidents occurred in Haifa, Jaffa, Safed, and other places. In Kfar Shmaryahu, two Arabs died and one was injured. In the city of Tyre, three Arabs were also injured in clashes with the police. Road guards in Safed repeatedly opened fire, dispersing Arabs who were plotting to destroy railway tracks. Orange groves along the Jewish settlement in the Akko region were burned down. The police station in Nazareth was shot at by Arabs, but there were no casualties. In the Old City of Jerusalem, a British policeman was shot in a vital area near an Austrian hospital by Arab rioters. At the same time, a British artillery unit has set out from Egypt and is expected to impose martial law at any time. A group of soldiers from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire brigades also departed from Alexandria, Egypt, last night. The British military strength here will be increased to six infantry regiments and one armored car battalion. Last night, an Associated Press reporter, under police protection, visited a Jewish prayer site. Traditionally, people pray there day and night, but last night, despite it being a Jewish holiday, there were only three elderly men. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem The state of unrest throughout Palestine is still serious. The families of British officials here have already left the country for refuge. Admiral Pound, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, arrived at the port of Haifa yesterday aboard the flagship "Barham" and immediately transferred to a plane to fly to Jerusalem to confer with British High Commissioner Wauchope on the current situation. The Jewish Agency recently issued a declaration discussing the issue of Jewish immigration. Abu al-Ghadhi, secretary of the Arab Higher Committee, also issued a declaration in response, stating, "The land in Palestine is small and cannot accommodate the immigration of the Jewish people. The Jewish people's idea of taking Palestine as a place to live and thrive hinders the Arab autonomy movement." It is rumored that the Arab Higher Committee intends to hold a meeting with the executive of the Jewish Agency to discuss ways to resolve the disputes. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Labor-Management Negotiations Break Down</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the striking workers in the metalworking factories around the capital have been staying in the factories for the past two days, they have not caused disturbances or prevented the managers of the factories from entering. Labor leaders have now issued a statement saying that this labor unrest is purely occupational in nature and has no political implications. In the past, whenever there was labor unrest, the factories often hired unemployed workers to replace the striking workers, thereby undermining the strike movement. The workers in the metalworking factories decided to stay in the factories to prevent such situations from occurring. As for the demands made by these workers, such as the implementation of a 40-hour work week and the signing of labor contracts by union representatives on behalf of the workers with the employers, these cannot be regarded as excessive. In addition, it is generally believed that these workers have been making these demands for more than a day. Recently, because of the electoral victory of the parties belonging to the left-wing Popular Front, their momentum has been strengthened, and they have begun to strike in the hope of implementing their original demands. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The trend of strikes in which workers stay in the factories but do not work is now rapidly spreading to machine factories throughout France. Large factories in the country, such as the largest automobile factory in France, with 32,000 workers, are now also participating in the strike movement. French Prime Minister Sarraut is paying close attention to this matter and has repeatedly held meetings in the Ministry of Interior and the Executive Yuan. Many members of parliament believe that this labor unrest is a move by the Communist Party to make things difficult for the new Socialist government. However, the Socialist Party denies that this movement has revolutionary implications, saying that the workers' actions are merely intended to avoid being locked out by the factory when their demands for wage increases and improved treatment have not been resolved. This labor unrest uses a new tactic: staying in the factory but not working, so that the factory will not be able to recruit new workers to undermine the labor movement. It is generally recognized that this is one of the most effective tactics in recent labor unrest. (Reuter's dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Labor has drafted a solution to the metalworking industry strike, namely that the employers and worker representatives should study the various demands raised by the striking workers, and that the employers should not punish the strikers after they return to work. It is reported that the employers have accepted the above solution, but on the condition that the workers return to work first. The union representatives also believe that this method is sufficient to resolve the disputes between labor and management and have accepted it. Labor Minister Frossard has also scheduled to invite representatives from both labor and management at 4:00 PM tomorrow to begin negotiations, so that the method of signing labor contracts with the employers by the workers belonging to the union representatives can be implemented. Frossard has announced to the press that all metalworking factories will be able to resume work uniformly, and that tomorrow afternoon's negotiations will proceed smoothly. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the labor unrest occurred in the metalworking factories in the suburbs, the striking workers stayed in the factory buildings overnight, but the police have not intervened, except to maintain order in the vicinity. In addition, labor and management have agreed on the basis for resolving the dispute yesterday, that the union should come forward to represent the workers belonging to it and sign labor contracts with the employers. It was also decided that Labor Minister Frossard would invite representatives from both sides at 4:00 PM today to conduct negotiations based on the above basis. This method was the result of day-long consultations yesterday between representatives of labor and management from various factories, as well as Prime Minister Sarraut, Labor Minister Frossard, and labor union leaders. After this consultation, the employers finally agreed that the union could come forward to represent the workers belonging to it and sign labor contracts, but on the condition that all striking workers immediately return to work and no longer stay in the factory buildings. The employers also promised that they would not punish the striking workers after they returned to work. With the opinions of both sides becoming more harmonious, the agreed method will be submitted to the delegation of striking workers this morning. If there are no objections, then negotiations between labor and management can be held as scheduled this afternoon to seek a final resolution. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Fellow provincials from Shanxi in Beijing, concerned that Shanxi Province has recently suffered banditry and severe disasters, have formed a Banditry Disaster Relief Association to raise funds for disaster relief. They have recently written to various ministries and commissions of the Central National Government, as well as governments at all levels, groups, newspapers, and compatriots throughout the country, appealing for disaster relief for the people of Shanxi. The letter states that Shanxi has suffered from the disturbance of Communist bandits, with more than 30 counties affected by the disaster. Homes and properties have been burned and looted. The old and weak have been abandoned, and the young and strong have scattered and fled far away. This is an unprecedented disaster and a great tragedy. Now, thanks to the strict encirclement by the central army and local troops, the flames of banditry have been slightly suppressed. However, rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, and settling the displaced, are urgent tasks for handling the aftermath. They beg for generous donations to relieve their distress, as a little can save many lives, and a compassionate heart can move those who are sympathetic.

<h3 id="e102">Negotiations on the Xiamen Japanese Residents' Perpetual Lease Rights Case <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul's Visit to the Province Yields Principles</p>
<p>Japanese Monk Forcibly Excavates and Moves Civilian Graves</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Recently, the Xiamen Municipal Government has delayed approving the case of Japanese monk Shinhuiyun, who accepted a donation of land from Japanese residents Zhang Youji and Lei Yiming from Taiwan at the former site of Daguanyuan to apply to the Municipal Government for permission to construct a Dong Sect temple, "Hongan-ji." The Municipal Government believes that in law, our country does not recognize the perpetual lease rights of foreigners' real estate. The Japanese Consul has subsequently raised the entire issue of the perpetual lease rights of Japanese residents in Xiamen, seeking to further obtain legal recognition. However, this has also been unsuccessful. Japanese Consul Yamada Yoshitaro flew to the province on the 21st to meet with Chen Yi and directly negotiated this case.</p>
<p>After several negotiations, the Japanese Consul returned to Xiamen on the 25th and visited Mayor Li Shilin again on the 26th to discuss the matter. According to provincial news, the Provincial Government has reached an agreement with Japanese Consul Yamada on the issue of Japanese residents purchasing and leasing land in Xiamen, with the fundamental principle of not infringing on sovereignty and not exceeding the treaty. Other minor issues will be handled by the Xiamen Municipal Government, which will deliberate the situation and continue negotiations with Yamada based on this principle. Li made arrangements to visit Chen Yi in the province again on the 28th after consulting with the Japanese Consul. In addition, a week ago, the Xiamen Tax Bureau, upon order from the Provincial Government, imposed a deed tax of 4% of the rental price on the perpetual lease land and houses of foreign nationals in Xiamen, plus an additional 10% for education fees. Furthermore, within the area requested by the Japanese monk at Daguanyuan, there are over 80 civilian graves. After the Japanese Consul urged the matter, the Municipal Government issued a notice in mid-April, stating, "Construction will commence within the area, and all graves must be relocated within one month to receive compensation from the Public Works Bureau." Subsequently, some grave owners within the area submitted deeds after relocation, requesting payment of compensation. The Municipal Government instructed the Public Works Bureau to respond, "This Bureau's notice for relocation is to prevent encroachment and profiteering. Since the residents have purchased the land at a price and have a contract to rely on, the determination of ownership is already clear. It should be known that this Bureau only has the responsibility to protect the legally acquired rights of the people and has no right to freely dispose of them. External rumors should not be lightly believed." Later, those who submitted deeds requesting preservation also received the same response. At the same time, the Public Works Bureau also stopped issuing relocation fees. As a result, everyone believed that the Daguanyuan land negotiation had made headway, and the construction of the temple could be canceled. Therefore, they waited and watched and did not relocate their graves any further. However, on May 24th and 25th, the Japanese monk's side suddenly and unilaterally hired workers</p>
<p>to continuously excavate and relocate 25 graves. When asked, they said, "All graves will be completely cleared to begin construction." On the 26th, five representatives of the grave owners, including Zhuang Dachuan, Guo Jinbang, and Su Zhusan, went to the Public Works Bureau to petition for a halt. The Bureau agreed to report to the Municipal Government to negotiate with the Japanese Consul, temporarily suspending excavation and awaiting a thorough investigation. If it is indeed proven to be the property rights of Japanese residents, the Bureau will instruct Chinese citizens to relocate voluntarily, without the need for Japanese monks to relocate on their behalf.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government recently promulgated the Provisional Regulations on the Rental of Land and Houses by Foreign Churches, ordering all counties and cities to comply. This was also prompted by the Hongan-ji case. The original text is as follows: "Article 1: Foreign churches may rent land and construct or purchase houses in the interior in the name of the church to establish churches, hospitals, or schools that are permitted by treaties between their country and China. Article 2: Foreign churches shall comply with current and future laws and taxes of China when renting land to construct or purchase houses in the interior. Article 3: Foreign churches shall jointly submit applications with the owners to the governing office for approval when renting land to construct or purchase houses in the interior. The contract shall only then be valid. Article 4: The governing office shall not approve applications for foreign churches to rent land in the interior to construct or purchase houses if the area exceeds what is necessary. Article 5: If it is found that foreign churches are using rented land to construct or purchase houses in the interior for profit-making or business purposes, the governing office may prohibit it or revoke the rental or purchase. Article 6: Before the implementation of these provisional regulations, foreign churches should retroactively submit reports to the governing office for land and houses already occupied in the interior. If the land is purchased outright, it will be considered a perpetual lease. Article 7: These provisional regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (May 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Japan's Northeast Immigration Plan <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Failed Radical Policies, Adopted Gradual Strategies</p>
<p>Planned Immigration of One Million Households Over Twenty Years</p>
<p>Japanese People Extol the Fertile Land of Eastern Manchuria</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Japan's immigration to the Northeast used to be very aggressive, but it has repeatedly failed. Now it is changing its plan and is studying concrete methods for current implementation, generally adopting a gradual strategy and considering financial conditions, etc. In the first year, 20,000 people will be immigrated to various parts of northern Manchuria. The area of each household's arable land is planned to be 2 chōbu of paddy field and 8 chōbu of dry land, totaling approximately 10 chōbu. Matters such as publicity and recruitment for immigration will be managed by the Manchuria Immigration Association established by Japanese residents in Changchun. As for land purchase, cultivation guidance, and finance, these will be managed by the newly established Manchuria Colonization Association by the Japanese. The issue of how much the subsidy amount will be is quite noteworthy. The previous experimental immigration was generally around 2,000 yuan. This time, it seems to be a number of 2,500 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Even if it is 2,000 yuan per household, a million-household immigration plan, even if it is said to be a twenty-year continuing project, will require several hundred million yuan in funding. Whether this funding can be afforded by Japan's current financial situation will determine the success or failure of the immigration issue. Recently, the relevant authorities in Japan have begun to discuss this issue, and considering Finance Minister Baba's repeated statements on the active policy towards "Manchukuo," as well as the national defense perspective held by the central departments of the Japanese Army, there is an absolute need for immigration to "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>According to Suzuki, a Japanese inspector of the Railway Administration, who inspected eastern Manchuria, the area along the Ninglin and Linmi Railways is an area for Japanese and Korean immigrants. The land is exceptionally fertile, the water conservancy is convenient, and the surrounding scenery is no different from Japan. It is located south of Harbin, and there are two coal mines, Jixi and Didao, along the railway line. As long as people live there, economic development will be possible.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine Strike <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Workers Demand Continuous Shifts and Resort to Passive Resistance</p>
<p>The Strike Has Not Subsided, and the Mine Area is Under Strict Guard</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine experienced a strike on the 23rd of this month. Although the Tianjin Mining Bureau has stated to the outside world that the strike is not serious and will subside quickly, according to news from Tangshan, the situation is still serious. The city of Tangshan is effectively under a kind of undeclared martial law, guarding against any kind of riot. The cause of this strike is that some underground and external workers felt that their lives were becoming increasingly difficult and that their income was insufficient to maintain them. They demanded that the mine allow continuous shifts to increase their income. Since this spring, they have raised this matter with the labor-management liaison office stationed at the mine, but it has not been approved. The mine refused the request for the reason that the sales of coal from Kailuan have not been strong in recent years, and there is too much stock. Last autumn, a five-day work week was implemented to reduce stockpiles and save expenses. Workers conscientiously implement the eight-hour system, so everyone has work to do and does not have to stop work for one day each week, reducing workers and suffering unemployment. At the same time, they also vigorously suppressed the behavior of [workers] taking over the work of others, bullying the weak, and being violent against the minority. Regarding the mine's surface workers, most belong to contractor gangs. The work is usually measured and not timed. For example, worker A digs one ton of coal per day and receives two jiao; digging two tons yields four jiao; and more is added accordingly. In the past, strong workers bullied the weak. Worker A was supposed to work two shifts a day, but they ended up working three or four shifts, and also took away the work of worker B. Although worker B had the name of a worker, they could only work at most six or seven shifts in a month. Since last autumn, due to efforts to rectify the situation, these malpractices have been almost completely eradicated. On average, each worker can work twenty-five or six shifts per month, earning about twenty yuan or seventeen or eight yuan in wages. The mine has indeed achieved the goal of not laying off workers to maintain the livelihood of the majority. However, the general workers who usually rely on bullying the weak and seizing work are very dissatisfied. They repeatedly launched passive resistance movements, demanding that the mine restore the old system and needing continuous shifts. The mine ignored them. Its response to the workers was nothing more than two points: Allowing continuous shifts would increase coal production, leading to more stockpiles and greater losses for the mine. The current business situation is not good, and there is no need to increase production. If production is restricted due to allowing the far shift, it will be necessary to lay off some workers. The mine cannot bear to benefit a few people while disregarding the interests of the majority. The world labor system advocates the "three eights." Now workers work eight hours a day, which is in line with this. Allowing continuous shifts means that each person works twelve to sixteen hours. Over time, their energy will not be able to keep up, which will directly harm the workers' own health and indirectly affect the mine's production. Based on these two points, the mine explained to the workers. However, the mine's words fell on deaf ears, and the workers were still unwilling to give up. At 2:00 PM on the 23rd, some off-shift workers, such as Qian Yongze and Cong Dehai, held wooden sticks, hoes, and other tools at the mine entrance to prevent the underground workers from going down the well to change shifts, resulting in a reduction of over 600 tons of coal produced that day. At that time, the mine bureau mobilized a large team of armed mine police to disperse the blindly following workers and arrest nine people, including Qian Yongze, sending them to the court. The off-shift workers, seeing their comrades arrested, gathered to rescue them, clashing with the mine police. Fifteen people were slightly or seriously injured, and two policemen were also injured. The order was greatly disrupted. The mine police temporarily announced martial law, prohibiting workers from entering or exiting, and guarding the mine entrance to prevent sabotage by rioters. However, underground workers Li Shun, Jiao Dianrong, and others held weapons to threaten workers in various trades to stop working and go on strike together. At 4:00 PM, over a thousand workers gathered in the mine, intending to rush out of the mine bureau and march along the streets to the Tangshan Office of the puppet Eastern Hebei Government to petition. The mine police prevented them from listening, and another conflict occurred. Mine policeman Huang Fengqun was severely beaten. The mine police, feeling overwhelmed, fired warning shots, but the workers continued to advance. The puppet Tangshan Public Security Bureau received a report and mobilized a large team of police to assist in the suppression, which finally restored peace. Over thirty rifles of the mine police were confiscated by the Public Security Bureau police to prevent another tragic bloodshed. The 24th was a tense day. Workers gathered several times, planning to surround the court and forcibly demand the release of the workers arrested by the mine police. Fearing incidents, the court ordered the nine workers in custody to be released on bail pending trial. The workers sent out several representatives to the labor-management liaison office stationed at the mine, demanding that the following articles be allowed: Allow continuous shifts. Do not dismiss the leading representatives. There should be no more abuse of workers. The office immediately telegraphed the Tianjin Mining Bureau. The Mining Bureau believed that the workers' demands were unreasonable and advocated a tough stance. On the 25th, it replied by telegram to Wei Zidun, the director of the labor-management liaison office, and Zhang Guanru, the secretary, ordering them to handle the matter severely. Wei and Zhang followed the instructions and issued a notice dismissing all ten of the ringleaders, including Qian Yongze, and forbidding them from ever being re-employed. Because of this, the workers became even more angry. Some expressed sympathy for those who were dismissed and continued to be passive. Wei and Zhang gave four speeches to the workers before and after using loudspeakers, advising them to resume work, but this was ineffective. The mine was full of police, with strict guards and cut off access. On the morning of the 26th, although a few workers went down the well, no coal was seen coming out by the evening. Zhao Lei, the captain of the puppet Tangshan Security Corps, and Lü Liangchen, the director of the Public Security Bureau, specially assisted Wei Zidun in establishing a mediation committee to try to mediate. If the progress is smooth, the strike may not escalate.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Guangdong Construction Department Plans to Establish Silk Factories <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Shunde Factory Site in Rongqi</p>
<p>Nanhai Factory Site Undecided</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: He Qilong, Director of the Construction Department of Guangdong Province, has decided to establish two silk factories to develop the province's silk industry. Some days ago, he sent Huang Yong'an, director of the silk department of the provincial textile factory, to Nanhai and Shunde counties to survey and select sites. After receiving the order, Huang completed the survey and yesterday submitted the investigation report and survey results to the Construction Department. After reviewing the report, the department ordered Liao Chongzhen, Director of the Silk Bureau, and Lin Shiduo and Zhang NieFeng, section chiefs of the department, to jointly review it for approval. The department has now reviewed and approved the results, stating that the report on the Shunde factory site describes in detail the conditions in Chencun, Lecong, Rongqi, and Daliang. The report also lists the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a factory in each location, and it is considered that the Rongqi Beibiansha area in Shunde County is the most suitable. This is because the area has the advantages of convenient transportation, clean water sources, lower construction costs, concentrated raw materials, and easy promotion to inspire other silk factories. As for the Nanhai factory site, compared to Guanshan and Lanshi, Lanshi is more suitable. Guanshan has a low-lying terrain, making it prone to flooding, and has inconvenient transportation and polluted water sources, which are major shortcomings for a silk factory. Lanshi, in addition to the advantages mentioned in the original report, is close to Lecong and Lianglong in Shunde, and Jiujiang in Nanhai, all of which are silk cocoon production areas, ensuring a sufficient supply of raw materials. Moreover, it is adjacent to Shiwan and Pingbu, Xiaochong, Luzhou, Ma'ao, and Xinlong Shuiteng in Shunde, where silk factories are densely located, making it easy to demonstrate improved silk production techniques. Therefore, it is most suitable for establishing a factory. The original report mentioned that the old site of the Yonghe Lun Silk Factory, close to the Lanshi Railway Station, is a pity because the area is too small and using civilian houses could cause disturbances. However, since the old Yonghe Lun site is inconvenient, it seems possible to find another site, which should be easy to handle.</p>

<p>Disaster Victims Eat Anything to Survive</p>
<p>Resulting in Successive Deaths</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Hundreds of thousands of disaster-stricken people in Huoqiu, Liu'an, and Hefei counties in Anhui Province have resorted to slaughtering and eating corpses in the market due to the lack of food during this lean season. Although the Central Relief Commission, the Anhui Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, and various parties of the Red Swastika Society have successively sent personnel with funds to provide relief and have opened porridge kitchens in the disaster areas where survival depends on relief, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket. According to a telegram from Liu Xichun, a special commissioner of the Red Swastika Society distributing relief in the disaster area, all parties are deeply concerned about the severity of the disaster and are still trying their best to provide relief. Recently, the Central Relief Commission allocated another 5,000 yuan for relief in Liu'an and 2,000 yuan in Hefei. The Red Swastika Society has allocated 9,000 yuan to Huoqiu County, 1,500 yuan to Liu'an, and 1,000 yuan to Hefei, all of which are being distributed. The Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of Bandits in the Border Areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, deeply moved by the situation, held a fundraising performance in Liu'an and raised more than 2,700 yuan, which was used to open four porridge kitchens and a shelter for disaster-stricken children. Currently, many refugees in the disaster areas are eating anything to survive, resulting in successive deaths and the widespread spread of epidemics. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness and has become a living hell. Upon receiving the news, the Wuhu Red Swastika Society purchased a large quantity of medicine and sent it to the disaster area for medical relief. (27th)</p>

<h3 id="e115">Spring Cocoons Will Soon Appear on the Market <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In the spring silkworm season in Jiangsu Province this year, various farms produced a total of 1,595,244 clean silkworm cards. After exporting 400,000 cards to Zhejiang Province, more than 1,190,000 cards are left for use in this province. In addition, there are 50,000 Japanese cards. Assuming that each silkworm card yields about 30 catties of silkworm cocoons, the spring silkworms in this province can produce about 400,000 piculs. According to the regulations of the Economic Commission, which convert the price at 30 yuan per picul of fresh cocoons, the total amount of cocoon money flowing into the rural areas of the province will reach 12 million yuan. In this county, the number of spring cards released to silkworm farmers by the model district is 174,209, the number sold at retail by various farms is 65,755, and the number ordered by card vendors is 159,037. The total number of cards in Wuxi is 399,0516, which can produce more than 120,000 piculs of fresh cocoons. Currently, silkworm farming in the four rural areas is affected by the cold weather, and the timing varies. The early batches have mostly gone up the frames, the middle batches are shedding their skins and opening their leaves, and the late batches are still in their third instar. The market price of mulberry leaves is 1.5 to 2 yuan per picul for branches and stems, and 3 to 3.5 yuan per picul for leaves. In addition, the registration of cocoon shops and leaf shops has been completed. The date for collecting cocoons is expected to begin on the 3rd or 4th of next month. The cocoon price is expected to be 30 yuan per picul for improved varieties and 20 yuan per picul for native varieties.</p>

<p>Cocoon shops throughout Jiaxing County have uniformly started weighing native cocoons. Shops buying improved varieties will also start weighing in the following days. The Seventh District Unified Management Office for Cocoon Collection believes that the land price of native cocoons is 11 yuan, and the lowest must be more than 19 yuan. Fearing that various shops will undervalue purchases, which would be detrimental to the interests of silkworm farmers and damage the government's credibility, it has ordered all cocoon shops to comply. If any underprice below the specified price, the fee payment certificate and shipping certificate will be withheld first, and then more severe penalties will be imposed. In addition, an inspection office has been established in Weixin Street, Jiaxing, and inspectors such as Xu Youdan have been assigned to inspect the silk cocoon transport to facilitate tax collection.</p>

<p>This year's spring silkworms in Zhejiang Province have been developing well due to the recent warm weather. The weighing of native cocoons has already begun and will be completely finished around the end of the month. The overall harvest is about 70% of a normal year. The weighing of improved varieties will begin in the following days. The cocoon price is around 32 yuan. The government has strictly cracked down on merchants lowering prices, resulting in prices exceeding the standard price. The harvest is expected to be completely finished around mid-June. The harvest in Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Anji, and Xiaofeng counties is slightly worse, about 70-80%, while the remaining 20 counties have a full harvest, with an overall harvest of about 90%.</p>

<p>Since the gunfight between bandits and police in Andong Town, Yuyao some days ago, in which one bandit was killed, detective chief Hu Guichuan and two detectives were injured, rumors have spread that the bandit gang is still planning to gather people to retaliate and has sent a letter threatening the town head, Chen Shun-jun, not to report the matter to the authorities or request reinforcements. Zhang Jintang, the chief of the Third District of the tax police stationed in the town, also received a threatening letter from bandits, asking him not to send troops to assist Hu Guichuan. As a result, the situation is tense, the local area is extremely chaotic, and people are particularly uneasy. Everyone fled the area at night. It is reported that there are more than 60 bandits involved in this plot, all former subordinates of the Communist Party member Fei Dezhao, who had already been executed. In order to stabilize the public's morale and investigate and arrest a large number of criminals, a request has been made to the county government to send troops to suppress the bandits, and a large number of teams have been gathered for defense.</p>

<p>The Jin family, a farming family in Shushan Village, Dongxiang, Xiaoshan, recently experienced cold and rainy weather. All the silkworms had mostly gone up the frames and were unwilling to spin silkworm thread. On the 27th, they used fire to roast them near the silkworm mountain to warm them. Unexpectedly, after 12:00 midnight, the whole family fell asleep, and the sparks spread to the grass on the silkworm mountain. Suddenly, red light rose everywhere, and the smoke filled the house. By the time the family realized it, the fire was raging and could not be controlled. Also, because the ladder had been burned, all four members of the family, both male and female, could not escape and were all buried in the fire. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of the newspaper: In the Suzhou News column of this month's 22nd issue, there was an article about the rich coal deposits in Xishan, in which it was stated that the Chengjin Coal Mine in Dongting Xishan, Suzhou has been operating for many years, using indigenous methods of mining, and has spent 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in capital. The current mine owner, Lu Gantang, is short of funds and plans to lease it to others for continued mining. Those who have been contacted include Du and Zhang, well-known figures in Shanghai, and the overseas Chinese Wang, etc. It has now been agreed that Wang will take over. It has been learned that our mine owner is Mr. Luo Ganchang, not Lu Gantang, and there is no leasing of the mine to the overseas Chinese Wang. We fear that the rumors are inaccurate and will have a significant impact on our mine. We request that you make a correction. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, The Preparatory Office of the Xishan Chengjin Coal Mine</p>

<h3 id="e125">Customs Announces Smuggling in North China Remains Rampant <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Tax Revenue Loss This Month Does Not Decrease Compared to Last Month</p>
<p>Amounting to a Huge Six Million Yuan in Twenty Days</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Regarding the smuggling incidents in North China, the Customs authorities had previously issued a detailed report, published by the Central News Agency until the end of April this year. Now there is a second report, briefly describing the smuggling situation in North China in the first and middle ten days of May, which is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>During the three weeks from May 1st to May 20th, the smuggling situation showed an increasing trend. Not only did the total amount of smuggled goods increase, but also the types of smuggled goods emerged in an endless stream. From the war zone west to the Beining Road area, wherever trains can pass, smuggled goods are rampant and unimpeded. The revenue of the Tianjin Customs is decreasing daily. Its tax revenue depends only on a few goods with extremely low tax rates and bulky items that are not easily transported by rail, such as machinery and hardware. It is estimated that the tax revenue loss in the three weeks reached a total of 6 million yuan, an average of 2 million yuan per week, which is about the same as the amount in April. The goods that are smuggled the most are white sugar, rayon, and cigarette paper. In addition, there are kerosene, lubricating oil, piece goods, pigments, iron wire, bicycle parts, seeds, apples, medicines, butter, toothpaste, tires, canned food, food, fruit juice, cosmetics, raincoats, soda, candles, nails, mica flakes, hardwood, kerosene, needles, beans, milk, cotton, silk braids, rubber shoes, batteries, and so on, in all shapes and sizes, without exception. The most noteworthy is the increase in kerosene and liquor. It is particularly hoped that the liquor is not needed for the manufacture of heroin. In addition, there were two cases of military fire, which are also very noteworthy. Now, the statistics of smuggled goods arriving at Tianjin East Railway Station in the three weeks up to May 17 are as follows:</p>
<p>Based on the above estimates, the tax revenue loss in the three weeks reached a total of 6 million yuan, an average of 2 million yuan per week. The import locations of smuggled goods are mostly in Nanlizhuang, Nandasi, and Beidaihe, which are not trading ports permitted by treaty. The Chinese government has the right to confiscate these cargo ships and their goods. However, the Japanese authorities do not allow Chinese customs anti-smuggling vessels to perform their duties there, so China is absolutely unable to protect its treaty rights. Although the Customs authorities are often subject to violent interference, they are still doing their best to maintain their dignity within the possible scope. On May 16, the customs patrol team seized seven cars of smuggled goods transported from Qinhuangdao in the Mengjiadian area, full of beer and Japanese wine. Although the area is within the territory of the Hebei-East puppet organization, the patrol team finally detained it. Afterwards, two Japanese came and claimed that the goods had been taxed in Hebei-East, and demanded their release. Otherwise, the Hebei-East authorities would not recognize the tax payment certificate of the Customs authorities. They were aggressive and unreasonable. The matter is still under negotiation and has not been resolved. However, the Japanese consulate seems unwilling to support the Japanese, as they are deeply afraid that these smuggled goods will leak into the puppet Manchukuo and cause disturbances. The Hebei-East puppet organization has set up a patrol office in Beitang on the 18th, which is headed by two Japanese. This matter is quite noteworthy, because Beitang is outside the war zone and not in the Hebei-East puppet organization area.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Seamen's and Grocery Industry Association Encourages Industry Colleagues to Report Smuggled Goods <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Regulations and Procedures Compiled into a Booklet</p>
<p>Do Your Best to Assist with Strict Attention</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Products and Grocery Industry Association, in view of the expanding smuggling in North China, issued a notice to all industry colleagues, saying: Since the scope of smuggling in North China has been expanding day by day, the sales of national goods are on the verge of extinction, and the industry and commerce in various places are also greatly affected. According to the Customs estimates, the tax loss in the recent two or three months has reached as much as 30 million yuan. As a result, it not only affects the income of the national treasury, but also affects the credit of foreign debts guaranteed by tariffs. Not only that, due to the exclusion of smuggled goods, legitimate commodities cannot be sold. As a result, factories stop work and workers lose their jobs. How important is its relationship to the national economy and the people's livelihood? Thinking of this, we cannot help but shudder. In view of the seriousness of the smuggling incidents, the government has successively promulgated various anti-smuggling laws and regulations in order to remedy the situation. At this point, we can only embrace the determination to save ourselves and save the country, and learn from each other to assist the government in the implementation of anti-smuggling measures in order to alleviate the current difficulties. Although these smuggled goods have not yet invaded Shanghai, in view of the reports of smuggled goods flooding North China and the price being no guarantee, it is difficult to guarantee that some people who see profit and forget righteousness will not try to transport and dump them in Shanghai. If so, if we do not pay attention, we are always in danger of being deceived and falling into the net of the law. It is the duty of this association to compile the recently promulgated "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Tax Evasion" and "Provisional Regulations for Inspecting the Transportation and Sales of Imported Goods" into a booklet and distribute them to all industry colleagues for reference. If any smuggled goods are found, it is especially important to report them to the association for handling. This is the power granted to the association by the government, and we, as members of the industry, should do our best to assist and pay close attention to it. Please do not neglect it. This is our sincere hope. We hereby notify you, for your public information.</p>

Wang Huaifen from the Ministry of Finance, Zhang Jiong from the Audit Department, Lu Shuping from the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Xu Fu, director of the Finance Bureau (represented by Xia Maoxin), attended. After Xia Maoxin, as the chairman, reported the situation, the lottery was carried out. A total of one chi was drawn, and the winning number was Zero Nine, which should repay 60,000 yuan of principal. The current interest payment is 195,300 yuan.

<h3 id="e129">Jiangsu Province Ordered All Counties to Strictly Prohibit Copper Coins from Leaving the Country Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Those with Ministry of Finance Passports Are Not Subject to This Restriction</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday issued an order to the county governments of Shanghai Baoshan and other counties, saying: "Since the central government implemented legal tender, the exchange rates of copper coins in various counties have been uneven. Traders from counties with low copper coin prices buy copper coins and purchase goods from counties with high copper coin prices in an attempt to make profits. The impact has resulted in some counties having an excess of copper coins while others lack them. Although the central government has ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to accept and exchange them, the counties without the three banks are still inevitably subject to the above-mentioned abuses. In order to remedy the market, the export of large amounts of copper coins is prohibited. If they are to be carried to the locations of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications for exchange, the proof documents must be checked before being released. This method will maintain the balance of the number of copper coins in each county and will not hinder the central government's promotion of legal tender. However, the Central Bank, Bank of China, or other firms that have transportation of copper coins with passports from the Ministry of Finance due to the relationship of the regulator should still not be restricted by the preceding provisions, with a view to giving equal consideration." After the Ministry of Finance telegraphed the above provisions to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered all counties to comply.</p>

<p>Board of Directors Memorial Address</p>
<p>The Board of Directors' memorial address states: We, Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shanghai May Thirtieth Martyrs' Cemetery Board of Directors of the Republic of China, Wang Xiaolai, Vice-Chairman, and Directors Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Cheng Xiechun, Qin Runqing, Zhu Yinjiang, Xu Jili, Yu Zuoting, Guo Shun, Zhao Jinqing, Gu Xinyi, Wang Binyan, Wang Hanliang, Wu Zhihao, and Wang Yansong, respectfully offer flowers and clear spring water to the spirits of the martyred heroes. Alas, these heroes sacrificed their blood and flesh on Nanjing Road for the revival and survival of the nation, and it has been eleven years since. Seeing the mountains and rivers of our motherland, the scope of devastation is widening day by day. How can we not feel heartbroken? The armies and private goods that oppress our nation come and go as if entering an uninhabited land. Who is responsible for this? Who has caused this? It is the fault of us who live on that we have failed to advance along the bloody path of the martyrs. We have been forced to awaken, we have been forced to rise up! If we want national revival, if we want national survival, we know that we must use blood and flesh to tread the bloody path of the martyrs and move forward! Alas, rest in peace!</p>

<p>Part of the Silver Will Be Shipped to the United States for Deposit</p>
<p>Overdrafts Can Be Obtained When Necessary to Consolidate Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>After the Central, China, and Communications Banks received orders from the Ministry of Finance to buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions, foreign exchange transactions have been concentrated in these three banks, and prices have been very stable. Since the establishment of the Sino-American Monetary Agreement, our country has complied with the agreement and shipped part of its silver to the United States for deposit. Overdrafts can be obtained when necessary, with the aim of stabilizing foreign exchange. Therefore, foreign exchange stability is becoming increasingly consolidated. For example, the foreign exchange rates announced by the Central Bank yesterday were: London at one shilling and two and a half pence, New York at twenty US dollars, Paris at 458 francs, Berlin at 75 marks, Japan at 103 yen, and Hong Kong at 93 Hong Kong dollars, the same as in recent days. There has been no significant fluctuation since the reform of the monetary system on November 4th of last year.</p>
<h3 id="e133">New Cocoons Continuously Arrive in Shanghai: Silk Factories Prepare to Start Work <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>This Year's Fresh Cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang Total One Million Dan</p>
<p>The Loan Syndicate Continues to Accept Applications for Cocoon Purchase Loans</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: This year, the spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, after the National Economic Council and the Sericulture Improvement Committee dispatched male and female instructors to various regions to provide guidance, have developed well and hatched properly. The output, although not as high as expected due to the cold weather, is still significantly better than last year. It is estimated that Jiangsu Province has about 600,000 dan of improved and native breeds combined, Zhejiang Province has about 310,000 dan of improved breeds and about 180,000 dan of native breeds. The total fresh cocoons from the two provinces amount to one million dan.</p>
<p>Syndicate Continues to Provide Loans</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Purchase Loan Syndicate, formed by various banks in the city, after processing loan applications for cocoon purchases on the 6th of this month, has already closed the application period for silk cocoon merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces on the 20th and 25th of this month, respectively, having loaned out a total of more than 6 million yuan. Cocoon merchants in various parts of Zhejiang Province have already started purchasing cocoons at the standard prices set by the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Association. Due to the weather impact in Jiangsu Province, the cocoon season is later, and cocoon merchants in various places will have to delay cocoon purchases until the 4th or 5th of next month. In order to facilitate loan acquisitions by silk factories and other cocoon merchants, the loan syndicate has made special arrangements to continue accepting applications, scheduled to close on the 2nd of next month. At the same time, after the Zhejiang Cocoon and Silk Control Association borrowed 5 million yuan from the bank, it has also dispatched personnel to various regions to start purchasing cocoons.</p>
<p>Silk Factories Prepare to Start Work</p>
<p>Silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, because this year the banks organized a loan syndicate to purchase cocoons, and the loan procedures are more convenient than in previous years, have mostly borrowed from the syndicate to purchase cocoons. Now that the spring cocoons will soon be purchased in succession, they have all started preparing to arrange the start of work. The Cocoon and Silk Association has also purchased 1,000 new-style silk reeling machines and distributed them to various silk factories for application as an improvement model. The 36 silk factories in Shanghai, including China, Guangyuan, Xiancheng, Changji, Xingchang Tongyu, Yihe, Jiuyu, Huasheng, and Xinchang, are particularly busy repairing machinery and renovating factory buildings, and will start work after the new cocoons arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>New Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai for Storage</p>
<p>This year, silk factories and other cocoon merchants that purchase spring cocoons mostly borrow from the loan syndicate to purchase them. Therefore, when purchasing cocoons, they uniformly purchase them at the announced standard cocoon price, report the amount of cocoons purchased each day to the supervisor sent by the syndicate for review, and bake them into dry cocoons. After being packed into packages, they are immediately transported to the warehouse designated by the syndicate or the factory warehouse for storage. Therefore, the new cocoons shipped from Shaoxing, Haining, Chongde, and other places to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Shanghai-Ningbo railways have been stored separately in bank warehouses. It is reported that a large batch will continue to arrive within a few days.</p>

<p>A Total of 2,000 Boxes Were Transacted</p>
<p>Highest Price Was 260 Yuan</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports: The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee will implement direct foreign trade of black tea this year. All black tea transported from Qimen in Anhui Province and Ningzhou in Jiangxi Province will be stored in designated warehouses by the Transportation and Sales Department. Decorations, etc. will be sorted out to suit the sales channels of foreign merchants. Recently, more than 13,000 boxes of new tea have arrived in Shanghai in succession. The Transportation and Sales Department organized a quality evaluation committee, and selected experienced personnel as committee members to evaluate the quality of the new goods that were transported, and various procedures have been completed. The black tea with the evaluated quality was divided into 105 numbers, and the set price was marked and sent to foreign tea firms the previous week. The opening was originally scheduled for the 25th, but it was postponed again because the foreign merchants requested a bank guarantee. The Transportation and Sales Department replied that the Bank of Communications would provide a guarantee. If the goods delivered within 100,000 yuan and within eight months do not match the tea sample, the guarantor will compensate or return the goods. An agreement has been reached. The foreign firms held a tasting session the day before yesterday, and officially held the opening at 9:00 AM yesterday. Wang Yusan, deputy director of the sales group of the Transportation and Sales Department, presided over the auction. Yesterday, a total of 2,000 boxes of black tea were transacted, divided into 15 numbers. The highest price was 260 yuan, and the lowest price was 100 yuan. On average, the price was higher than last year. The buyers were more than a dozen tea merchants from various countries, including Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, Tongfu, Tianyu, Tianxiang, and Dodwell. It is also known that the black tea transacted yesterday will be packed and exported to meet the needs of the tea market in various countries. As for the payment, it will be delivered one week after loading, according to the usual practice.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association, seeing that a part of the fish merchants in the Sixteenth Concession were stopping sales due to the fish market, through the efforts of the Association's Chairman Yu Qiaqing and Standing Committee Member Jin Tingsun, the fish merchants, appreciating their sincerity, gradually showed a tendency to change their minds. The Association yesterday telegraphed Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry to report, and also sent a letter to the Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association, urging all fish merchants to open the market first. The letter and telegram are recorded below: Telegram to Wu Minister of the Ministry of Industry, Nanjing Ministry of Industry Wu Minister Junjian, previously received your face-to-face instructions, urging fellow villagers to open their fish markets. After repeated pleadings, all markets also deeply understood the great difficulties of the department and appreciated the Minister's intentions. They are now being urged to open the market immediately and discuss ways to join the market. If there are real difficulties, I hope the Minister will preside. This telegram is hereby submitted, respectfully requesting your review. Also, the letter to the Yong Fresh Fish Trade Association reads: Dear Sirs, this time, the fish merchants of your association stopped sales due to the fish market, which is deeply regrettable. The Association, based on hometown friendship, has repeatedly stated the difficulties of the fish merchants to Minister Wu in all sincerity. We were instructed to urge all markets to open the market first. All the details have been fully informed to the representatives of each market. We hereby earnestly request your association to urge fellow merchants to understand the Minister's good intentions and open the market immediately, and discuss other ways to join the market. If there are difficulties, the members of our association will be responsible for negotiating with the market authorities and the Ministry of Industry in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. This letter is hereby sent, hoping you will investigate and reply.</p>

<p>The Zhongxing Iron Factory at 79 Chengou Jia Road has been selling charcoal engines to various places in Zhejiang and Shaoxing since inventing them the year before last, and they have been quite popular. The factory has recently used firewood to manufacture engines, and the experiment has been successful.

<p>All Ships, etc., Will Be Sold Separately</p>
<p>And a Shareholders' Meeting Will Be Held on a Scheduled Date to Decide</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Inland Waterways Shipping Bureau, which is owned by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after being taken back for self-management, although it has tried its best to rectify the situation, is still burdened by excessive debts. It owes the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company more than 500,000 yuan. Moreover, the development of road transport in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has made transportation more convenient, resulting in operational difficulties. Lao Mian, who is also the manager, submitted a report on the rectification to the Ministry of Transportation for approval. It was ordered to cease operations and close down, and all ships will be sold separately. The order was received last month. The manager and Cai Zengji, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, agreed to convene a shareholders' meeting on June 25 to decide everything. At the same time, shareholder registration will be processed first. It is found that the bureau has a total of 20 ships, including Hengsheng, Hengji, Hengren, Liyuan, and Hengheng, and 20 cargo ships and tugboats. The routes are Shanghai-Huzhou, Shanghai-Suzhou, Shanghai-Lishui, Shanghai-Xia, Shanghai-Wuxi, Shanghai-Qing, Xia-Hai, and Xi-Li.</p>

<p>Fulong in Haizhou... Huaqiang in Yuxikou</p>
<p>The Fulong vessel of the Sanbei Company in this port, with a deadweight of 1,911 tons, a length of 263 feet and 2 inches, a width of 38 feet and 3 inches, a depth of 15 feet and 5 inches, a draught of 14 feet, and a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour, was dispatched to Haizhou to transport salt. The vessel was fully loaded with salt on the afternoon of the 18th of this month and set sail. The Fulong vessel suddenly ran aground at Chenjiagang. The reason was that the water level at Chenjiagang had dropped sharply, and the Fulong was heavily loaded with a deep draught, causing the vessel to sink into the shallows. After the accident, the captain repeatedly reversed the engine, trying to get away on its own, but the bottom of the Fulong had sunk deep into the shallows and could not move. Fortunately, the company's Fengpu vessel was also in Haizhou. Upon receiving this news, it immediately sailed to assist. However, the water at the grounding site was too shallow, and the Fengpu vessel could not tow it, and could only look at the sea and sigh helplessly. In despair, the Fulong captain telegraphed Shanghai for help. Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai company immediately sent a telegram ordering the Fulong captain that if it could not get out of the shallows at high tide (these days are during neap tides), then part of the salt in the vessel should be unloaded using barges to reduce the vessel's weight and then try to rescue it. After this telegram was sent, the company received a reply from the vessel captain yesterday saying that the salt merchants were unwilling to bear the losses of dispatching barges to unload the goods and the barge fees, and the bureau had to acknowledge them. As a result, this matter cannot be resolved for the time being. Now we can only sit and wait for the spring tide and then try to tow it out of the shallows.</p>
<p>The Huasheng Company's Huaqiang vessel, managed by Yitaixing in this port, with a deadweight of 5,000 tons, is currently loading coal in the Yangtze River. Yesterday morning, the Huaqiang vessel was fully loaded with coal at Yuxikou, opposite Wuhu, and set sail. Due to the low tide (there is also tidal water rising and falling in Wuhu), it also ran aground. The vessel was fully loaded with coal, the draft was heavy, and it could not move at all. Repeated attempts to escape the shallows failed. Yesterday afternoon, the vessel captain had telegraphed Shanghai to report. Upon receiving the news, Huasheng Company, in addition to informing Tang Jun Danhua of the China Ship Insurance Federation, is discussing the progress of sending a vessel to tow it.</p>

<p>In order to promote the sales of domestic goods to Nanyang, the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association specifically organized the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group to promote them. Domestic goods factories participated enthusiastically, and it is now scheduled to depart from Shanghai on July 3 on the French China Company's Zhishadani vessel. With the departure imminent, the group held a members' meeting at the association's headquarters on Suzhou River Road yesterday, attended by more than ten people, including Zhang Huikang, to discuss all preparatory matters. The selection of the head of the group will be determined at a meeting convened next week. It is also learned that the itinerary of the group's departure this time has been decided to go to the Philippines first, following the road to Java, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Siam, Saigon, and other places, and then transfer to Hong Kong to return to Shanghai. The inspection period is scheduled for three months. Nanyang Chambers of Commerce and other groups have sent telegrams to welcome them and promised to assist in promoting the domestic goods products of various factories.</p>

<p>Stipulating Compulsory Membership of the Trade</p>
<p>The Municipal Leather Goods Manufacturing, Steel Bar Scrap Iron, Paint Woodware, Cattle and Sheep, Machine Noodles, Fish Wheel Kitchen Rice Manufacturing, Green Oil Flower Shell, Pedicab Manufacturing, Flower Tree, Cotton Carding, Dough, Bamboo, and other trade associations jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday suggesting compulsory membership of the trade association. The original text reads: Dear Sirs, Recently, I read a news report (May 29) about Ma Yinchu talking about effective ways to deal with smuggling. Regarding the organization of industrial and commercial trade associations, there is a plan to force the industry to join the association, and the affiliated association is very happy to read it. The organization of the trade association is to promote the interests of the trade and correct the abuses of business in order to promote industrial and commercial development and increase production. However, in recent years, although there are hundreds of trade associations, there is no provision for compulsory membership, and each still goes its own way. For example, competition in the same industry is aimed at imitation and counterfeiting, and reducing materials and lowering prices is the ability. The environment is getting worse and worse, the products are becoming more and more crude, the public loses faith, and the industry has concerns about losing money. If this continues, industry and commerce will collapse. If it can be stipulated by law and compulsory membership is required, and the articles of association are followed, the market price is delineated, and the color of the product is stipulated, there will be no abuses of stealing work and reducing materials, and there will be no worries about price drops and losses. The products will become more and more refined, and the credit will become more and more famous. Foreign goods will be cut off, and industry and commerce will have no hope of development. Today, Mr. Ma Yinchu can care about industry and commerce, which is really admirable. All our industrial and commercial groups should unanimously support and promote its realization. In addition to forwarding it to the Legislative Yuan's Ministry of Industry, we especially recommend that you discuss and forward it to the Legislative Yuan's Ministry of Industry to amend the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Trade Association Law in order to save the collapse of industry and commerce. This is the greatest prayer.</p>

<p>Telegram from the Shanghai Merchant Steam Navigation Bureau Stevedoring Office: To all newspapers, please note: The China Yangtze River Leading Pilots' Association recently sent a telegram stating that foreign customs officers are manipulating China's pilotage rights, denying the qualifications of personnel trained by the pilotage training center, raising pilotage fees, and restricting the number of pilots, causing China's pilotage industry to be permanently ruined. If we do not urgently seek to save it, the dangerous situation is unimaginable. In addition to having submitted a petition to the Central Executive Committee to promptly abolish the Pilotage Management Committee and transfer it to the direct management of the Ministry of Transportation, it is also stipulated that all pilotage personnel in the country who have been trained and qualified by the Naval Pilotage Training Center and hold certificates, or who have served for more than five years without fault, and have proof from the shipowner, may be exempted from examinations to perform their duties, so as to ensure protection and prevent manipulation by foreigners, taking into account national defense. We also ask all national seamen's organizations to unanimously advocate, assist in appealing, and work together to achieve the goal. Accordingly, domestic pilotage is the guidance of waterways. If it is allowed to be manipulated by foreigners, national defense will be endangered in the event of military action, as evidenced by the past French warships entering the Min River port and Japanese warships entering the Liu River. Moreover, when our country is making every effort to revive the nation, we must not abandon the country's only claim. Remembering the past and tracing the present, we cannot help but feel chills. Our office is willing to lead all members and pledge to be the backing force, and will not stop until the goal of preventing foreigners from manipulating pilotage rights and consolidating national defense is achieved. We hereby send this telegram for your information. Shanghai Merchant Steam Navigation Bureau Stevedoring Office.</p>

<p>The problem of factory inspection in the concessions has not yet been resolved despite repeated negotiations between the municipal government and the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is now heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council has discussed and decided on the regulations for the installation of steam engines and other pressure machines. According to these regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Council has the right to inspect factories with steam engines and pressure machines in the concessions. New factories that need to install such steam engines and pressure machines in the concessions must also be handled by engineers approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Shanghai Municipal Council has established a review committee for these approved engineers, with five members: three from the International Chamber of Commerce, one from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, one from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and one from the Employers' Federation. Among the six people, only the representative from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce is Chinese. It is now heard that this kind of organization is suspected of infringing on the Chinese government's sovereignty to inspect factories, and the authorities are considering it closely.</p>

<p>Presentation to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>We respectfully report that the case of Wang Binyan's Jiangzhe垫欵, which was caused by public affairs, was previously submitted by the local public group to the municipal government requesting relief. We are deeply grateful that your seat has approved the method to maintain it. However, it has not yet been granted, and our expectations are even deeper. Wang Binyan has been in Shanghai for more than thirty years, and has always devoted his loyalty and sacrificed everything for local public welfare and the happiness and security of the people. During the various wars, he always focused on maintaining the locality. Therefore, Zhabei has been able to turn danger into safety and suffer no losses, which is not an exaggeration of our people. For example, during the January 28th Incident, Wang also maintained the locality for more than thirty days, patrolling day and night, and maintaining it in every way. Although there were petty thefts, the society was still quiet. This is due to Wang's presence. We are deeply grateful for this. Today, Wang is suffering from public affairs, even to the point of bankruptcy. First, the property was seized, and then auctioned off. It is tense every day and pressing every step. Once auctioned, he will have nowhere to go. In addition to our people benefiting, our conscience has not disappeared. Therefore, we specially jointly petition your seat. If Wang's property is auctioned off, it will be tantamount to abandoning the protection of our people. Your seat has always been extremely kind and regards the citizens of Zhabei as children. How can you bear to put their nanny to death? Abandoning Wang is abandoning the people. Now, we boldly present our request and respectfully ask your seat to quickly consult the court to postpone the auction. At the same time, we request your government to temporarily垫欵 84,000 yuan to clear the lawsuits. The money will be repaid by the original debtors of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, or the original contract will be mortgaged, and your government will collect it from the citizens and use it for the citizens. This is also a matter of common sense and reason. If your seat gives a promise, everything will be resolved. The amount is only 84,000 yuan, not all of it, and it is easier to implement. We also ask you to show mercy to our foolish sincerity, and those who are grateful will not be just Wang alone. If we are blessed with a promise, Zhabei will be fortunate, and the merchants and people will be fortunate. We respectfully present this to Wu, Mayor of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Letter to Yu, Du, and Wang: We respectfully inform you that Mr. Wang's case has been discussed with Minister Kong, who agreed to present it to the Ministry of Finance and then to the municipal government for subsidy. This is all due to your public's great assistance and enthusiasm for public welfare. We are deeply grateful. However, the municipal government must be troubled again to have a thorough consultation with the mayor, so that it can be effective. This case has been in litigation for many years, and success or failure depends on this one action. We ask you to use your influence to bring the matter to fruition from beginning to end. Not only will Mr. Wang be cleared of the lawsuit, but the local people will also be grateful to no end. We hereby express our thanks and wish you a speedy progress.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, in view of the fact that registered rickshaw pullers generally do not save money and suffer from food shortages when business is slow, has decided to organize a petty savings association for members in the society's various meeting places in order to encourage members to save. The procedures are simple and the interest rates are generous. The purpose is to enable rickshaw pullers to save a little from their daily income after deducting daily legitimate expenses. Therefore, the savings amount is set at a minimum of one cent in silver dollars, and the monthly savings amount should not exceed five yuan. For savings of less than 50 yuan, the interest rate is one cent per month. The method for exceeding 50 yuan will be determined separately. All members who join the savings association will be given a passbook. The withdrawal of savings will be based on the member's rickshaw license and seal. It is understood that this kind of savings association is a pioneering initiative in the country. The accumulation of small amounts into large sums is quite interesting. It is expected that the total number of registered rickshaw pullers in Shanghai is over 40,000, and the number of participants will be very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>According to reliable information from the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, the Ministry of Railways believes that the current railway parcel transport rates, where light but bulky items are calculated based on volume converted to kilograms, impose an excessive burden on merchants.

It is stipulated that this will be implemented from June 1 of this year. The revised parcel transport rates are listed below: Within 250 kilometers: 7 cents; From 251 kilometers to 500 kilometers to 750 kilometers, or less than 50 kilometers: 3.75 cents; From 751 kilometers onwards: 2.5 cents.

This was reported by the company's General Manager Zhang Rongchu, and it involved Executive Members Wang and Lu of the Chamber of Commerce. The situation was very serious for a time. The incident was heard by the authorities of the National Government, who immediately conducted an investigation. As for the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce itself, in addition to convening emergency meetings of all executive and supervisory members, based on the forged documents provided by the informant and Zheng's confession, they resolved to dismiss Zheng Dengqing's position as executive</p>
<p>committee member to maintain discipline. With respect to Zheng and Zhang, it was deemed that they had violated criminal law. Therefore, Chairman Yu Zuoting, on behalf of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, entrusted lawyer Yuan Hanyun to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court, stating that Zheng Dengqing forged an investigation document in March of this year and falsely signed Yu Zuoting's name at the end of the document, with the inscription "Please Mr. Zheng Dengqing Investigate Secretly" and the signature "Zuoting." Zhang Bofang first sent a letter to the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, falsely claiming that Yu Zuoting had secretly dispatched Zheng Dengqing to investigate whether the materials used by the company for manufacturing party and national flags</p>
<p>were Japanese goods, and notified Zhang Rongchu. Subsequently, on April 16, Zhang again used the aforementioned forged document to request something from Zhang Rongchu in the name of investigating Japanese goods. Therefore, Zhang brought a film of the forged document to Yu's residence on the following day to report it. An emergency meeting was immediately convened, and it was resolved to send a letter to the Supervisory Committee for thorough investigation. On April 20, Zhang Rongchu published an announcement in the newspapers entitled "Zhang Rongchu Narrates the Causes of the Failure of Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company," and another emergency meeting was convened to resolve to publish a</p>
<p>statement that it was forged. Soon, the Supervisory Committee replied in a letter that it had been confirmed that Zheng Qing had forged the investigation document and Chairman Yu's signature, and that Zhang Bofang had used the forged document to request something from Zhang Rongchu, etc., were all true. The actions of the two defendants illegally damaged the reputation of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The facts are obvious. It is requested that they be summoned and punished for the crimes of forging documents and damaging credit under Articles 210 and 313 of the Criminal Code. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi specially opened the court to summon the defendants Zheng Dengqing, who claimed to have gone to</p>
<p>Qingdao to recuperate, and Zhang Bofang, who also claimed to be ill, did not appear in court. Each hired a defense lawyer to appear in court and requested a postponement. However, the plaintiff Yu Zuoting was heard with his agent lawyer Yuan Hanyun and witness Zhang Rongchu arrived in court. Judge Jiang interrogated Yu, who stated that he was 49 years old, from Zhenhai, residing at 11 and a half Herstall Road, Shandong Province, Shanghai, working at Siming Bank, and currently serving as chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. He said that he was representing the Chamber of Commerce to sue Zheng and Zhang. Zheng was an executive member of the Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang was a former employee of the Chamber of Commerce who had been</p>
<p>dismissed long ago. In April, after I returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou, Zhang Rongchu inquired by phone at night</p>
<p>Ask me about the dispatching personnel to investigate, I immediately told him that there was no such thing.Zhang Nai on the 16th of April the following day brought the investigation documents to the residence, I observed that it was indeed forged, so the next day I reported to the Standing Committee to resolve the handing over to the Supervisory Committee to thoroughly investigate. Whenever the Municipal Chamber of Commerce issues documents, it must be signed by three of the five standing committee members, there is no example of the chairman signing alone, and there is no intention to send personnel to investigate the company, then the Supervisory Committee verified that the document was indeed forged, and they also summoned Zheng Zhang and Zhang Rongchu to the meeting to ask about it. Zheng and others confessed themselves without concealment that the</p>
<p>forgery, therefore, it has now been resolved to revoke Zheng’s name as an executive member, As for the request Zheng and others made to Zhang, after all, what did they request, when they admitted it in the meeting, it was because they were not a supervisory committee member and were not present, so they could not know, etc. Then they presented the forged document Zhang's letter to Zhang, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's executive and supervisory committee's documents for this case, and the Zheng's confession record together, for review. Then, Zheng Rongchu claimed that he was 36 years old from Wuxing, residing at 112 Daxi Road, serving as the general manager of the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company. Before April 20, Zhang Bofang wrote a letter saying that the national flags made by the party that can</p>
<p>prove the material,Sun Department of White Goods, told to contact Zheng Dengqing to dredge up, I shall offer the flags made once presented to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Central Propaganda Department for special permission, so he replied to Zhang Bofang that please ask him to investigate as much as he could, and I did not want to dredge up, Nai Zhang came and said again, the Chamber of Commerce has already decided to send personnel to investigate, so if you don’t quickly dredge up to Zheng, I am afraid it will be inconvenient, I still refused him, on April 10, our party was sitting down with Zhang Zilian and talking, it turns out that Zhang suddenly arrived and said that the matter has been enlarged, although his special permit will also be revoked, Zheng Dengqing also has difficulty to do it. If you want to mediate, you have to save Mr. Wang and Mr. Lu quickly</p>
<p>find a way from the middle, when he said that, he also mentioned the investigation document of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, asking me to give him 50,000 gold, so that I can save Mr. Wang and Mr. Lu to remedy, although I only have met Zhang once, but I have not met him for the past two years, Zhang still said at that time that he had troubled Mr. Wang and Mr. Lu to settle one thing before the year, so this time it should still be entrusted to handle it, I heard Zhang say that and I was still not tempted, and then I first asked Chairman Yu by phone, according to the reply, there was no dispatching investigation, so I sent the investigation documents handed over by Zhang to Yu for review on the next day, and I knew that it was</p>
<p>from the forgery, so a statement was published in the newspaper on April 20. Yesterday, members of the investigation team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau came and took the document to examine it, and only gave it back, so he presented the document for record, and claimed that the central government is now investigating, I am afraid it will also be necessary to ask for the original document, can you please issue it, Judge Jiang said that all the documents presented need to be examined in detail, and he temporarily ordered the record, so that the defendants' lawyers shall notify the two defendants separately, and shall not use the excuse of illness not to arrive in court, and postponed it until 2:00 PM on June 5 for trial. The conclusion was adjourned</p>
<h3 id="e184">Suspecting a One-Dollar Reward: Indian Constable Shoots and Kills Cousin: Armstrong Took Revenge; Hang Baoshan Was Also Shot <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>An Indian named Avv Baggu Guansheng, 35 years old, has been serving as a gatekeeper at the China Industrial Bank at No. 130 Beijing Road in the Public Concession for more than ten years. He is extremely kind and conscientious in his work, so he is deeply trusted by the bank. Moreover, the bank's director, Gong Xinchan, also pitied his hardship, and always gave him rewards whenever he came to Shanghai. Five years ago, Avv Baggu Guansheng, because his cousin Armstrong had been unemployed for a long time and was on the verge of starvation, pleaded with the bank to arrange for him to be employed. He was allowed to be employed and was also assigned to be a gatekeeper, alternating between day and night shifts with Avv, receiving a monthly salary of 35 yuan. Unexpectedly, once Armstrong's livelihood was secured, he suddenly resumed his old habits, constantly seeking trouble and quarreling with others. He even drank excessively and looked for trouble for no reason, so that those who associated with Armstrong were all afraid of him like a tiger and rushed to Avv to complain. Avv repeatedly advised Armstrong at the time, but Armstrong not only did not listen but even regarded Avv as an enemy. However, Avv remained the same as before, being kind and considerate. The day before yesterday, the bank's chairman, Gong Xinchan, came to Shanghai from Tianjin and gave Avv Baggu Guansheng two paper dollars as a reward. Avv immediately gave one paper dollar to Armstrong and told him its source. Unexpectedly, because the previous rewards were always two yuan per person, Armstrong suspected that Avv had deliberately embezzled the other half, so he held a grudge. At about 4:00 AM yesterday morning, he secretly carried a water pipe and rushed into Avv's bedroom. Avv was sleeping soundly and had not yet woken up when he struck Avv's head hard. Avv's skull was pierced, and his brain matter spilled out, and he died immediately. However, Armstrong was still afraid that he was not dead and struck another blow, which happened to hit another Indian constable who was in the same bed on his right foot. He woke up in pain and saw Armstrong standing by the bed with a hideous look. He was greatly frightened and jumped out of bed and ran out. Armstrong thought that it was Avv Baggu Guansheng, so he chased after him. Unexpectedly, the doorway of Avv's bedroom happened to be the sleeping place of Hang Baoshan (37 years old), a Yangzhou native who was the bank's cook. At that time, he had been awakened by the commotion and was about to get out of bed to peep when Armstrong stepped out of Avv's room and saw Hang standing at the doorway. Thinking that he was coming to stop him, he also struck him with the iron pipe. He was hit and his scalp was broken, and blood flowed like a fountain. He immediately fainted, and Avv still continued to chase after another constable, all the way to Beijing Road and Bowu Yuan Road. Fortunately, at that time, a Western constable happened to be patrolling there, and another Indian constable ran to inform him of the whole story. The Western constable arrested Armstrong and took him to the police station. They reported to the British Consulate and requested them to send someone to investigate. The body of Avv Baggu Guansheng was transported to the forensic examination institute for examination. The injured constable and Hang Baoshan were also treated in the hospital afterward. The murderer Armstrong has been transferred to the British Consulate for legal action.</p>

<p>At about 10:40 PM the night before last, a red small coffin containing two human heads, resembling a boy and a girl, was discovered in a deserted area on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been verified that these human heads were not those of murdered victims. One was the skull of a four- or five-year-old boy who had died of illness, and the other was thought to be the skull of a three- or four-year-old girl of superstitious parents. A small coffin and a rush mat bag containing a corpse were discarded there a few days ago. The corpse was subsequently gnawed on by stray dogs, leaving only one head. Someone intended to move it into the small coffin, but when they opened the coffin lid, another head suddenly appeared. In a state of panic, they spread the word to the neighboring alleys, leading to a false rumor that they were the heads of a murdered boy and girl. Yesterday, the charity organization sent workers to remove and bury them.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Public Concession Authority Encourages Birth Registration: Issues Colorful and Finely Printed Birth Reports to Certify Children's Age and Various Rights <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Public Concession Authority has no regulations requiring the registration of births of Chinese residents in the concession, it is difficult to obtain accurate statistical reports. Recently, in order to encourage birth registration, the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has specially produced a colorful birth report, which is quite beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The design of this birth report is very much in line with the psychology of Chinese ladies. It features the sun, moon, stars, auspicious clouds, and two unicorns emerging from the clouds, which is in line with Du Fu's saying of a unicorn in the sky, as a premonition of the child's intelligence. On both sides stand young boys and girls, holding babies. Below is a magnificent building, resembling the scenery of the Bund, subtly reflecting the local scenery. Inside is the child's name, gender, date and place of birth, and the names, occupations, and addresses of the parents. From now on, all parents can register their child's birth at the nearest health branch and receive the colorful birth report signed and issued by the Statistics Section of the Public Health Department for a small fee of five cents. The birth reports of babies delivered by doctors registered with the Public Health Department can be directly obtained from the Statistics Section of the Public Health Department at No. 223 Hankou Road. Birth registration has long been implemented in various countries, and its benefits are approximately to prove age and origin, determine inheritance rights and various benefits related to age, such as school age, working age, marriage age, and age for holding public office. All parents who value their children's future interests should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e187">On Qimei Road: Patrol Police Arrest Two Robbers; One Robber Wounded by Gunfire <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>In the Qimei Road area of Zhabei, street robbery cases have been occurring frequently recently. Xu Wenlian, a resident of No. 6 Dexing Lane, Xiangyan Bridge Road, was walking home alone around 12 o'clock on the night of the 25th of this month. While passing Yangjia浜 Road, he suddenly noticed three robbers dressed in blue cloth short jackets following him closely. Fortunately, Xu was alert and avoided being assaulted. He paid close attention and, around 9:30 the night before last, spotted the same three robbers walking west along Qimei Road. Xu promptly reported this information to Patrol Officer Chen Lizhang at Post No. 5 of the Jixiang Road Sub-station. Officer Chen, along with Xu, followed them, observing their actions. The three robbers noticed they were being followed and scattered, attempting to escape. One robber crossed Guanzhong Road and entered Runde Lane. Officer Chen chased after him and, when he caught up, the robber immediately fired three shots from a Mauser pistol. None of the bullets hit. Seeing the dangerous situation, Officer Chen drew his gun and fired six shots in return. One bullet hit the robber's upper right shoulder, entering through the chest and exiting through the back, causing profuse bleeding. He collapsed to the ground and was apprehended. The police seized a No. 50518, No. 3 Mauser pistol, loaded with two bullets, and discovered five more bullets, seven yuan in legal tender, a pawn ticket, and a copper watch in his pockets. Xu Wenlian also bravely stepped forward and subdued another robber, finding an iron axe on his person. Only one robber escaped into the crowd. The two apprehended robbers were taken to the Linping Road Police Station. The wounded robber was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. His injuries were severe, and he was unable to speak. He was identified as Wang A'gen, also known as [blank], from Yancheng. The other robber was interrogated by the Detective Squad of the Night Traffic North Station. He confessed to being Zhou Yulin, from Yancheng, 28 years old. He claimed that a fugitive named Li provided them with firearms, and he and Wang A'gen committed the crime on Qimei Road, leading to their arrest. Police detectives, accompanied by Zhou, attempted to apprehend Li, but were unsuccessful. The case was reported to the General Bureau as a case of armed gang robbery with intent, and the suspects were detained for questioning. Meanwhile, a strict search is underway for the remaining accomplices, with a view to their severe punishment.</p>

<p>According to the National Society, Fan Yan Clan is 35 years old and from Ningbo Cixi. Her husband, Fan A'hong, was a tailor who passed away in 1925. She has a 13-year-old daughter named [blank] Ju. Since her husband's death, the widow has remained chaste for eleven years. As she has no one in her husband's family and is from a poor background, she returned to her maternal home after her husband's death. She assists her elder brother, Yan Liansheng, in running Jinji's meal delivery business at No. 14 Anxin Lane, Qinglian Street, Nine Mu Land. Since August of last year, she has been preparing meals for the Sheng Sheng Midwifery Vocational School on Route des Soeurs, Rue Puteaux in the French Concession. She purchases and prepares vegetables every day, with Fan Yan Clan doing the cooking. On the afternoon of the 22nd of this month, at 6:45 PM, while walking to the intersection of Ningbo Road and Dongxin Bridge Street, in front of the Yanze Hospital in the French Concession, she was suddenly accosted by someone she did not recognize. Without explanation, the person grabbed her. As the woman was about to call for help, she was struck and told to leave quickly, saying that soliciting customers was a violation of the regulations. Only then did she realize that the person was a patrolman from the flower donation gang. The woman, in a state of innocence, was unjustly assaulted and felt aggrieved. She vehemently protested and demanded that the patrolman accompany her to the Sheng Sheng Midwifery School and Jinji's meal delivery business for verification. However, the patrolman ignored her pleas and instead escalated the situation, calling the woman "old mouth" and dragging her to the Grand Zongmingzhong police station. Without interrogation, she was imprisoned. At 8:30 PM that evening, she was transferred to the Lujiawan police station. At 5:30 AM the next morning, the patrolman took the woman from the prison, forced her to leave her fingerprints, and then released her. The woman, who had remained chaste for eleven years, felt unjustly humiliated and requested assistance from organizations such as the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, Ningbo Native Place Association, and the Municipal Women's Association, requesting that they negotiate with the French authorities.</p>

<p>The steel skeletons and scaffolding of the three factory buildings for the Central Machinery Factory in Beixinjing, including the machinery manufacturing, iron manufacturing, and steel manufacturing plants, have been completed as early as January and February of this year, since construction began last year. However, the lead roofing sheets only arrived from England in March, so construction of the roofing only began in April. After an inspection by the factory director, Lu Weipu, it was discovered that the inside of the lead sheets had not been painted. Consequently, they were dismantled last month and two layers of paint and primer were applied. They are currently being reinstalled and are expected to be completed in about half a month. The walls, windows, and new-style air vents on the roof of each factory have already been installed, providing excellent lighting and ventilation. The machinery for each factory has been gradually transported and placed inside the factory buildings. As soon as the factory buildings are completed, the machinery can be installed. In addition, there is also a seamless pipe factory, for which bidding has already been opened, but the winning bid has not yet been announced. When completed, its scope will be larger than the three existing factories.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Over a Thousand Bean Curd Shops: Closed for Three Days Starting Yesterday <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Public Association's Efforts to Persuade Shops Failed; Slight Price Increase to Maintain Operations Started on June 1st</p>
<p>Over a thousand bean curd shops in the city, including those in Nanshi, Zhabei, the city center, the Public Concession, the French Concession, Pudong, Huxi, and other areas, have been affected by the severance of soybean supplies due to the occupation of the four northeastern provinces. The price of soybeans, which used to be over six yuan per dan (a unit of weight), has now soared to over nine yuan, an increase of nearly one-third. This has made it difficult for shop owners to maintain their businesses. Consequently, they decided to raise prices on the 29th of last month, to be implemented on June 1st. Fearing that consumers would misunderstand, they voluntarily closed their shops for three days starting yesterday.</p>
<p>Public Association Issues Emergency Notice</p>
<p>The Public Association issued an emergency notice regarding the price increase: "Due to the soaring cost of raw materials and significant losses, a meeting of all member representatives was convened on the 29th of last month to revise the price list of all goods, effective June 1st. Circulars have been distributed to each household for compliance. However, it has recently been reported that some businesses intend to close their shops for three days before the price increase. Such abrupt closures are inappropriate. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau has issued an order to all trade associations in the city stating that they may not close their shops without approval. We hereby solemnly declare that all businesses should not lightly close their shops, so as not to cause inconvenience. In addition to sending staff to persuade businesses, this notice is urgently issued as above."</p>
<p>Efforts to Persuade Shops Prove Ineffective</p>
<p>The closure of shops became a reality yesterday. Fearing misunderstanding, Association Chairman Tan Yueming, Standing Committee Members Qiu Senlin and Han Wenjun, and Secretary-General Shi Yizheng went to shops in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Huxi, and the two special districts to persuade them to resume business as usual. However, the shop owners remained firm in their attitude and refused to accept the advice. They will continue to close their shops today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Price Increase on June 1st Definitely Implemented</p>
<p>The goods on the market yesterday were a portion of the stock available for market application. However, with no goods for sale, even stale and smelly bean curd was selling at triple the price in various small vegetable markets. There will be no goods available for sale today and tomorrow. It is reported that the industry has decided to implement the price increase starting June 1st. The prices will increase by about one-fifth. The detailed price list is omitted for brevity.</p>

<p>Wu Xiqing, a local resident in his sixties living at No. 9 Bei'kai'er Road, has a wife, Sun, who has a habit of using opium. She was previously arrested by the Yulin Road police station and sentenced to imprisonment by the court. After her release, she remained weak and often ill, and continued to secretly consume opium at home. Between the 12th of this month, Zhu Ziting, a Zhenjiang native and a doctor residing at No. 4, Lane 343 Huade Road, colluded with Zheng Jianbo, a Shaoxing native and a neighbor at No. 55, Chuangjiang Lane, and Xu Tang, a Shandong native who falsely claimed to be an officer of the Garrison Command who is currently on the run, to extort money from Wu's family. They threatened to take Wu's wife, Sun, to the command headquarters and sentence her to death, among other intimidating tactics. Zheng, posing as a service lawyer, offered to find a way out, demanding 3,000 yuan to avoid the trouble. The amount was eventually reduced to 1,200 yuan, and then to 800 yuan. Between the 17th and 18th of this month, Wu Xiqing handed over 360 yuan in banknotes to Zhu and Zheng to be passed on to Xu Tang. Zhu's wife, Wang, advanced 40 yuan (totaling 400 yuan, half of the first agreed-upon amount), and the remaining sum was to be paid in two weeks. The money was handed over at Zhu Ziting's home. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, around 8 PM, Wu Xiqing continued to pay with a 400 yuan check from Zhejiang Industrial Bank. However, the group wanted cash and returned the check. Wu had to borrow 200 yuan in national currency from relatives and gave the money to Zheng Jianbo at Zhu's home. There was still 200 yuan remaining to be paid, and they agreed on a grace period. Zheng received the money and hid it in his pocket, claiming to go to the headquarters to discuss the matter with Xu Tang. As soon as he left the door, he was arrested by Chinese Detective Sun Aizhong of the Huisheng Police Station. Zhu Ziting took the opportunity to escape. His wife, Wang, was also taken into custody and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. 工部局 Attorney Zhang Shizhu explained the case and requested a postponement. Detective Sun reported the details of the case and presented 200 yuan in legal tender as evidence. The two defendants stammered in their testimony. Judge Xiao Xie 棻 ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Cai Dezhou, a local resident who runs a department store at No. 61, Lane 641, Earl's Court Road, has a friend, Guan A'di, 35 years old, from Guangdong. Guan recently introduced Chen Jinzi, a Cantonese merchant from a foreign company residing at No. 50, Ruihua Lane, Qiujiang Road, to Cai. Chen immediately offered to sell 116 packages of Wanli razor blades, worth 1,200 yuan in foreign currency. The deal was struck at 7 PM on the 22nd of this month. Cai paid 607 yuan in legal tender yesterday and issued a Shanghai Bank check for 593 yuan. Unexpectedly, only one sample package of razor blades delivered by Chen Jinzi was genuine, the rest were all tinplate. Realizing he had been defrauded, Cai secretly reported to the Huishi Police Station. Yesterday, when the check was due, the police sent detectives to wait at the Shanghai Bank. In the afternoon, Chen Jinzi instructed Guan A'di's wife to cash the check. She was immediately detained on the spot and taken to the police station for questioning.

<p>Lu Zhiliang Released on 8,000 Yuan Shop Guarantee; Chen Huang Clan Remanded in Custody Without Bail</p>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a Chongming farmer from Yanjiachao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was murdered on the night of November 27th of last year and his body was abandoned on the riverbank. The local保長 reported the incident to the local court for inspection. The deceased's wife, Chen Huang Clan, initially refused to have the body inspected, and later refused to appear. When prosecutor Li Fen of the court arrived for the inspection, the woman covered her face and showed no tears. Based on various circumstances, she was considered highly suspicious. At the same time, Lu Zhiliang, the deceased's maternal uncle, was in the midst of a lawsuit with the deceased, and the deceased was not well-behaved during his lifetime, so Lu was also considered suspicious. Both were taken into custody. A field investigation was conducted, and the local保長 reported that the deceased's children claimed that the deceased was murdered by Lu Zhiliang and Chen Huang Clan, who broke two of his ribs. After hearing the report, the prosecutor indicted Lu Zhiliang and Chen Huang Clan for murder. When Presiding Judge Cai Dingcheng reviewed the case, the children's statement was not made in court, and there was no other corroborating evidence. Moreover, the deceased was not well-behaved during his lifetime, so there may have been another murderer. Therefore, the judge declared the defendants not guilty. Lu Zhiliang was released on an 8,000 yuan shop guarantee, while Chen was remanded in custody without bail. Now, the original prosecutor has filed an appeal, stating that based on the past circumstances of the case, the defendants cannot escape suspicion. The prosecutor is requesting that the first instance judgment be corrected. The defendants will be sent to Suzhou for trial in the near future.</p>

<p>Smuggler Offenders Li Xing Sheng and Shen Fu Sheng</p>
<p>Since the Central Government announced the strict enforcement of anti-smuggling measures, a group of unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, have disregarded the dangers and dared to fall into the legal net. Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, Dong Mingde, the captain of the Sixteenth Embankment Detective Squad, received a tip-off that a large amount of smuggled artificial silk was hidden inside No. 33, New Embankment. He immediately led Team Leader Wu Songshan and detectives Wang Zhengrong and Wang Guilin to conduct a search. They seized four large packages of smuggled artificial silk in the room behind the parlor and arrested two smugglers on the spot. After questioning them, they identified themselves as Li Xingsheng, 36 years old, from Ningbo, who confessed that the goods were transported from Fujian by the Wanshang Wheel for sale, hoping to make a profit, and Shen Fusheng, 51 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 11 Ningkang Lane, Old West Gate, who admitted to conspiring to sell smuggled goods.

<p>At the Senyu tobacco and exchange shop at the entrance of Yi'an Lane, Zhujia Corridor, Caojiadu, Huxi, around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, five robbers suddenly tricked their way into the shop, pushed their way into the shop, and threatened the shop owner to hand over valuables. However, the shop owner, surnamed Zhong, had no savings. Although the robbers searched repeatedly, they only managed to rob ten foreign dollars and quickly left.

The competitors must have their chests straight and their arms free to swing. They must use their heels and toes when striding, but the rear toe is not allowed to be lifted until the front heel touches the ground, and the knee must be straight when the front foot touches the ground (it must be straight when the rear foot is lifted). If a competitor violates the above rules, the midway referee will give a warning and a penalty turn once. The third penalty will disqualify them.</p>
<p>Instructions for Referees</p>
<p>The dispute over the previous 10,000-meter race walking competition is still considered a regret. This time, the World Games Race Walking Preliminaries must be conducted fairly and without any prejudice. This matter concerns the selection of World Games representatives and should not be neglected like the previous 10,000-meter competition. Also, the World Games Race Walking Rules do not allow wearing soft-soled shoes (i.e., rubber soles). It is also hoped that the athletes and referees will pay attention.</p>
<p>Competition Route: The route is the same as the one set for the National Games last year. First, walk around the field for one lap, exit the East Command Platform gate, pass through Guohe Road, Fuxi Nei Road, Huanfu Dong Nei Road, Fu Nei, Road, Xianggu Road, Jungong Road, Zha Road, and Minqing Road to Fufeng You Road, for a total of four laps. Then, turn back to Dong Command Platform gate on the original route via Shanfu Xi Nei Road Guoe Road, and then make one final lap.</p>

<p>The two teams will no longer hold a final match</p>
<p>The China Football Committee held a meeting at the Jinlong Hotel at 6:30 PM on the 28th. The committee members present were Jiang Xiangqing (Chairman), Le Xiurong, He Chunhui, Ma Detai (representing Le), Recording Secretary Zhao Kang and Zhang Huijing (acting football association secretary Zhou Jiaqi). The chairman first reported that at the last committee meeting, it was decided that the championship trophy for the Hui Zi group must be determined by a final match between Jianmin and Qingxi. This was originally very fair, but after the decision and the final match schedule were announced, the Jianmin team suddenly protested. The original letter was forwarded by the secretariat, and after further deliberation, the protest letter was not accepted, and the original judgment was maintained. Shen, the secretary-general of the Sports Association, suggested to this committee that before the final match between Gonglian and Zheguang, the Qingxi team's schedule had already ended and that they had already secured the champion position with the highest score, which is to say, Qingxi had already won the championship trophy for the Hui Zi group. No matter the outcome of Gonglian versus Zheguang, it would not affect the already acquired legal rights of Qingxi. If Qingxi requested to receive the awards before the match between Gonglian and Zheguang, the committee could not refuse. Therefore, Qingxi's championship was truly the reward for a season of hard work. Unexpectedly, in the match between Gonglian and Zheguang, Gonglian used unregistered players, which resulted in their disqualification. All past matches between Gonglian in the two cycles were invalidated, and scores were not counted. This move reduced Qingxi's score by four points, while Jianmin indirectly benefited, and their score was one point higher than Qingxi's. Therefore, Jianmin's request to be listed as a champion was also legitimate. To respect the rights and interests of both parties and avoid future malpractices, the committee decided that the two teams must hold a final match to determine the ownership of the championship trophy, which was also the only fair solution to the difficult situation. But now it is no longer the football season, and one of the two sides is still arguing endlessly. It is specially suggested to the committee to judge that the two teams share the championship trophy so that it can be concluded as soon as possible, which is feasible for us, please make a decision. After discussion, it was decided to accept the suggestion of Secretary-General Shen of the Sports Association and ask the Sports Association to add another identical prize to be distributed to the two teams. (Reason) The committee had previously decided that the two teams must hold a final match to determine the championship, which had already confirmed that the two teams had equal qualifications. The decision to award and distribute the championship trophy is still in line with the original intention of the original plan.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Subsidies for Private Schools Under the Control of the Public Works Department <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Totaling over 220,000 Yuan, Applicants Numbered 244 Schools, Subsidies Could be Used for Awards</p>
<p>Regarding how to allocate this year's Public Works Department (PWD) subsidies of 227,760 yuan to Chinese private schools in the Public Concession, the Education Committee and the Chinese School Subsidy Review Committee have recently held several meetings to discuss the matter. It is reported that a total of 244 Chinese private schools applied for subsidies this year. Among them, 22 schools were deemed unqualified and will not receive subsidies. Of the remaining 222 schools, 46 are new applicants and 176 are previous recipients of subsidies. The Review Committee has recommended to the Education Committee that subsidies be granted to all, with appropriate amounts. The Education Committee, while generally approving the recommendation, felt that the facilities of 24 schools were still questionable and, as per usual practice, reserved them for reconsideration. Subsequently, these 24 schools were individually discussed and decided that one school would not receive a subsidy for the time being. Furthermore, according to the report of the Director of the Health Department, among the schools that previously received subsidies, 147 were considered satisfactory by the Health Department and complied with its regulations, while 30 needed improvement. Among the new applicants, the Health Department believed that 25 schools had the potential to be satisfactory and 21 were considered unsatisfactory. As in the past, schools with improvements in facilities and the potential to be satisfactory may receive subsidies in advance to encourage their improvement. Therefore, the 25 new applicants with the potential to be satisfactory should receive subsidies first, while the 21 unsatisfactory new applicants and 30 old schools will not be granted subsidies for the time being, pending their compliance with regulations and efforts to improve. It is reported that the Board of Directors of the PWD has expressed its approval of the aforementioned recommendations of the Education Committee.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding whether PWD subsidies for Chinese private schools can be used to establish scholarships, free student quotas, etc., the Education Committee previously considered it inappropriate. However, the Chinese School Subsidy Subcommittee of the Review Committee recently expressed support for continuing this practice, stating that the PWD's intention in granting subsidies was to assist poor students in general. Currently, the total number of students in Chinese schools subsidized by the PWD is around 46,000, with approximately 4,000 of them receiving free education, accounting for about 9% of the total. Therefore, it is difficult to abolish the existing scholarships and free student programs at this time. This matter was subsequently discussed by the Education Committee, which resolved that items such as scholarships and free student quotas could continue to be included under the subsidy usage items this year for experimental purposes. However, how to ensure that the actual situation and the funds used for these scholarships and free students are used properly still needs to be discussed in detail at the next meeting. The Board of Directors of the PWD has also agreed to the Committee's proposal.</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) The Jiangsu Province Secondary School Principals' Joint Association held its second general meeting of the second semester of this year on the 29th at the Zhenjiang Normal School. Thirty-four people, including school principals such as Cao Chu, attended. Shao Heting chaired the meeting. Matters decided: The enrollment dates for the first semester of the next academic year are set for July 2nd to 12th. Each school will select a date within this range for enrollment. The enrollment advertisements will still be jointly published, entrusted to Shanghai Middle School to handle. The registration fee will be halved in accordance with the orders of the Ministry and Department. During the examination period, the meals for teachers and staff will be provided by the school as normal expenses. All travel expenses for teachers and allowances for staff in the past will be cancelled. The Teachers' Day on June 6th should commemorate the teachers who have worked diligently throughout the year, following the principle of respecting virtue and rewarding merit. However, during this period of serious national crisis, everyone should intensify their work at all times. Therefore, there will be no holiday this year, but a commemorative meeting will be held during after-school hours, or a dinner party will be held for commemoration. This Association will jointly build an association building with the Teachers' Union. This Association will contribute 2,000 yuan for construction costs. This fee will be covered by the unpaid association fees of each school since the 21st year of the Republic and the accumulated surplus of the association fees of this Association, and will be charged at 2 yuan per grade per school. The method will be handled by the standing committee of this Association in contact with the standing committee of the Teachers' Union.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Using Sino-Dutch Boxer Indemnity Funds to Establish Sino-Dutch Cultural Institutions <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The total Boxer Indemnity Funds amount to 2,690,000+ Yuan</p>
<p>The total amount of funds returned by countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Belgium from the Boxer Indemnity to establish cultural and educational institutions, as well as the repayment period, the institutions established, and other information, have been reported in previous issues. Based on the investigation, the following is an abstract of the table showing the return of the Boxer Indemnity by the Netherlands. The return of the remaining Dutch Boxer Indemnity funds was resolved through an exchange of notes between the Chinese government and the Dutch Minister to China on April 4th, 1933. This exchange of notes is the agreement for the return of the Dutch Boxer Indemnity. The Chinese and Dutch sides then established the Board of Directors for the Management of Sino-Dutch Boxer Indemnity Water Conservancy Funds under the Executive Yuan in August of that year. Currently, there are two Chinese directors, Ma Chaojun and Sun Fushi, and one Dutch director, Paul Sowerby. The total amount of the Boxer Indemnity to be returned is 1,429,230.34 Dutch guilders. At an exchange rate of 0.53, it converts to 2,696,661.00 yuan in national currency. The principle of its allocation is that 65% is used for water conservancy projects in China, and 400,000 yuan is designated for the Nanjing Surveying and Mapping Institute. The remaining funds (this fund is managed by a board of directors composed of the Chinese diplomatic representative in The Hague, the president of the Faculty of Arts of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam, and the presidents of various universities) are used to reimburse the Dutch government for various advances made in China over the years. If there is a surplus, it will also be allocated to the Cultural Fund. The annual interest income of the Cultural Fund should be paid to the Academia Sinica of China at 53%, with 13/53 of that year's interest used as a subsidy for the Academy's activities and 40/53 used to send Chinese scholars and students to study in the Netherlands. Also, 47% of the annual interest income of the Cultural Fund is given to the Institute of Chinese Studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands. This return of the Boxer Indemnity will result in an annual income of approximately 108,477 Dutch guilders, with the repayment period ending in 1940.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Finance: Large Investors Eagerly Purchase Silver Bullion; Marked Price Once Exceeded 40 Yuan, But Gradually Fell Back, Ultimately Rising 1.6 Yuan <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced increased speculation due to the Bank of Japan's vigorous purchase of spot sterling, leading large investors to continue buying. The price briefly broke through the 40 yuan mark. However, it soon turned calm, and after a brief rise, it fell back. The morning began with overseas silver markets showing an increase in sterling and a steady dollar. It was said that there were some Indian and Chinese buyers after the market closed at the quoted price, as well as large sellers, so the market remained stable. Forward silver prices rose between six and two and a half hao. Exchange rates all rose. London spot gold fell by one and a half pence. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed that both the customs gold unit and the sterling-dollar exchange rate were unchanged. The standard gold price announced was lowered to 1134.4 yuan. However, market sentiment remained positive. Pre-market trading opened at around 38 yuan. The morning opening was slightly lower, but after the opening, rumors that a certain party was using Chinese legal tender in North China to exchange for banknotes and then using them to settle foreign exchange with the Bank of China in Shanghai fueled buying interest. Large investors rushed to buy bullion, gradually breaking through the 40 yuan mark. HSBC's exchange rate announcement showed that sterling and the dollar were both unchanged. Large investors took advantage of the high prices to supply, and the three major banks continued to sell spot sterling. Market sentiment gradually stabilized and the price fell back. However, there were still many buyers taking advantage of the low prices, and the equilibrium tax also rose by one cent. It was still easy to pull it up. After entering, the demand for equilibrium stabilized, and the overall trend became sideways. The market then calmed down again, with fluctuations of only half a yuan. The opening remained stable, but as the 40 yuan mark was difficult to break through, market sentiment became dull. Indian silver also remained unchanged. Finally, the market situation hovered. The swap premium rose again to around 3.5 yuan yesterday. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1138.1 yuan, 2 jiao lower than the previous closing. Jiu Da, Hui Xiang, Yuan Mao, and Yong Da De Cheng all advanced, rising to 8.7 yuan. Fuxing Yongda Fa and Yong Gong Tiao retreated to 8.3 yuan. It was reported that Wen Kang, Jiu Da, Hui Xiang, Yi Sheng Qian Chang Xiang, Mao Yong Da Fa, Yong Fu Yu all purchased. HSBC's exchange rate announcement showed that although sterling and the dollar were unchanged, the price still rose to 40.2 yuan. Fuxing Yong took advantage of the high price to sell vigorously. Qia Feng Yong Chun Yuan Yong Da De Cheng also bought, lowering the price to 39.2 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, rumors suddenly emerged in the market that Japan was increasing its troops in North China, followed by the navy. There were also rumors at the Tianjin Customs. Market sentiment was quite weak. Large investors, such as numbers 47 and 48, were the most eager to sell. However, the market price did not fall sharply. Only the first round of trading in the morning was severe. This was because, based on past experiences, general retail investors expected the market to rebound after the fall, and there were many who covered short positions. Therefore, the downward trend did not continue. Based on this speculation, it is inevitable that the trend will gradually move downward. In the morning opening, numbers 47, 40, 4, and 54 all sold. Although number 4 first sold and then bought, the market price fell, and the trend was consistent. The decline was 0.7 jiao for the larger ones and 0.3 jiao for the smaller ones. In the second round, although the front row saw a slight rebound of 0.2-0.3 jiao, types A and B remained weak and sluggish. In the afternoon opening, numbers 5, 35, and 47, etc., continued to sell. Numbers 4, 16, and 46, etc., bought slightly. The market situation was mixed, but there were still more declines than gains. The closing trades were cleared, and the fluctuations were very small. However, type D forward contracts suddenly performed well, rising by 0.3 jiao, while other types hovered around 0.1 jiao. The market has been brewing repeatedly. It rebounded slightly after the fall, but in reality, there is already a tendency to fall. The future is difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday's market price resulted in a consistent decline, but the number was only 0.25-0.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was 7.56 million yuan. The results of its gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Regarding May’s Golden Rooster Brand yarn, the opening price on December 2nd of the previous year was 205.4 yuan. At that time, after the implementation of currency paper reform in our country, prices stabilized, benefiting exchange rates. The yarn and flower market situation gradually became peaceful. Following this, the European war spread, the Italian-Abyssinian war expanded, and yarn and flowers worldwide rose together. The local market price followed suit. Securities firms and gold merchants were the first to be dragged in. On December 4th, the highest peak reached 213.4 yuan. Subsequently, with the approach of the end of the year, all parties closed their prices, and warehouse yarn stocks increased daily, reaching 300 bales. The market price turned upstream, falling back to nearly the 200 yuan mark. Until mid-March, with the development of spring sales, the mainland purchased large quantities of spot yarn. At the same time, the Qingdao yarn market jumped wildly, Shanghai Japanese yarn was out of stock, and the selling price soared. General non-industry speculators came out in droves, rushing into the yarn and flower market, absorbing forcefully. The buying momentum was unusually strong, and the market reached 210.3 yuan. Recently, the changes have been significant, and the fluctuations even greater. Market rumors are rife. The Sino-U.S. trade agreement and the government's full maintenance of legal tender credit are firm intentions in many ways. However, sellers, considering the rampant smuggling in the north, tend to sell off. The lowest price once reached 192.3 yuan. Afterwards, a certain party struggled vigorously, dragging in large quantities, and rose again to 200.9 yuan. Finally, due to sluggish yarn sales and excessive yarn stocks, sellers supplied large quantities for delivery, leading to a downward trend. The price fell to 195 yuan at the close, a decrease of 10.4 yuan compared to the opening price. As a result, 19,600 bales remained, a sharp increase of 9,100 bales compared to the previous month. The delivery volume was so huge, a new historical record. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 197.5 yuan, 5.5 yuan lower than the previous month. The delivered goods included more than 2,000 bales of new code such as 20-count Three Stars, Five Blessings, Jincheng, and Double Deer. The rest were previous yarns, continuing to be delivered. It is heard that the receiving parties were all banks, as well as a certain party. The rest were arbitrageurs at 5,000 to 6,000 bales. The delivering parties were mostly yarn merchants and Deda. The broker license numbers and delivery volume of both receiving and delivering parties are listed below:</p>

<p>The opening price of May’s standard cotton on December 2nd of the previous year was 44.25 yuan. At that time, after the implementation of currency paper reform, finance was stable. At the same time, domestic cotton production was affected by both water and drought disasters, and output repeatedly decreased. People's hearts were firm, and the market price advanced daily towards higher prices. Coupled with the tense European situation and the spreading war clouds in Italy and Abyssinia, U.S. cotton, Indian cotton, and third-grade cotton all turned to high flying in unison. The market atmosphere became even more enthusiastic. On December 4th, the highest peak was seen at 46.4 yuan. Afterwards, as the end of the year approached, U.S. cotton news was bad, and the forward price broke the one-cent mark. Indian cotton White Loch went from 220 rupees to 190 rupees. Sellers were active, and the market price fell in a straight line, to within 42 yuan. However, the banking sector and gold merchants did not absorb it. The market price rose again to 45.95 yuan. Extending to recently, with the rush of cotton flock from various villages to Shanghai for delivery, more than 100,000 bundles were delivered last month. This cotton lacks sales channels. 30,000 bundles continued to be delivered this month. As a result, people were panicked, and the market price tended to go downstream. The lowest price was once seen at 41.25 yuan. However, Tongji continued to receive goods, and it rose again to 43.6 yuan. Finally, due to the poor spot environment, it closed at a small 42 yuan, a decrease of 2.25 yuan compared to the opening price. As a result, 97,300 bundles remained, a decrease of 34,800 bundles compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the last three days, was 42.5 yuan, 2 yuan lower than the previous month. The delivered goods were still Tianjin cotton flock, Lingbao cotton, Tianjin fine cotton flock, etc. Tongji exclusively received 30,000 bundles of coarse cotton flock. Dongmian received 20,000 bundles of fine cotton flock. The rest were all self-delivery. The delivering party was Ningbo's Yuanxingchang with more than 20,000 bundles. The Hankou group was also huge.

<p>The yarn market is calm and lacks characteristics, with a stable trend. Encouraged by the rising overseas yarn and flower market conditions, people's hearts are firm, but spot yarn transactions have not seen much development. The standard yarn market has stopped gathering due to the handling of delivery procedures at the end of this month. It is found that the statistics of various companies buying spot yarn are 365 bales. The selling price is similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of various groups are as follows:</p>

<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The outlet for coarse and fine cotton in this city is very narrow, and export transactions are also light. The market situation is unusually weak. Xihe cotton was advanced by Fujiaxing 80 bales, the price was 43.3 yuan, advanced by Tongjixing 103 bales, the price was 43 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened. Liverpool news was good. Industry and foreign merchants bought in. There was rain in the west. Each month rose three to six points. Subsequently, due to forecasts of rain in the east, there was a slight reaction. New York and cotton farmers made some profit-taking sales. However, industry continued to purchase, causing sellers to hesitate. Currently, new cotton is 100 points different from July old cotton. At the close, short covering and industry buying continued to be firm and rising. Spot prices rose two points, futures rose down to eight points. English cotton spot prices rose one point, futures fell one point. Indian cotton was initially firm due to good overseas news, but later due to short covering and exporter buying, the market price increased.

<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market price was rarely up or down due to the stability of the market and the approach of the end of the month. Business in all directions was scarce. Printed cloth pieces, printed poplin, striped and plain poplin, printed linen yarn, patterned fabrics, etc. in this street were quite enthusiastic in wholesale and retail cutting. White goods advanced 30 to 40 pieces of Longxun fine cloth, more than 40 bales of 16-pound Wufu Hongfu coarse cloth and 18-pound Running Horse coarse cloth, sales were as usual. Tianjin and Yantai both still had purchasing intentions for heavy-weight coarse cloth and coarse materials. Transactions were still more prosperous with various plain and colored poplin. The Ningbo group handled about 50 pieces of light-weight coarse cloth, plain poplin, and foreign yarn. Yunnan and Guangdong roads handled a little fine twill, and the remaining ground was very desolate, it is said.</p>

<p>The Qimen black tea that the public is watching has officially opened yesterday. At the beginning, Chinese and foreign tea merchants gathered and discussed prices. First, Jardine Matheson selected the highest grade goods, bid at 260 yuan, and continued to search and buy in large quantities.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, each month showed a chaotic and brisk image again. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago rebounded eight cents to one dime, Canada was three to four dimes higher. When the opening price was quoted, the June price was as high as 3.05 yuan due to rumors of a short squeeze, and the transaction was smooth. The forward price was also suddenly smooth due to June, and the market rose by one, two, and three cents. Afterwards, each plate was difficult to thrive due to the slight blocking by large households, and the market trend was slightly flat and soft. According to half-day transactions, more than 80 packages were made. When the afternoon market opened, the June opening price was as low as one cent. Later, the situation improved again due to the continuous pulling by buyers. July and below were also vigorous due to the smooth absorption by non-industry large households. According to speculation in the industry, June is the handover of new and old, and changes are inevitable. However, in terms of the recent sales field, it may be difficult for forward flour to stand for a long time, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Futures and Spot Wheat Still Firm and Popular <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, each month's market was still vigorously increased. The quoted price of foreign wheat rebounded by three to four dimes. Furthermore, the futures flour market was vigorously increased due to the competition of powerful bulls. Therefore, the general non-industry float was panicked and covered their positions. For this reason, transactions were smooth. The market softened in four directions. Because the annual wheat yield this year is not bad, customers in the producing areas successively sold short. The future rise and fall should be determined by the abundance or scarcity of the wheat harvest. The spot wheat market was shouted up and increased by seven cents because the standard flour and Dong were consistently firm and popular, such as Shandong wheat and other 4.35 yuan, and only three to four hundred packages were traded, it is said.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various groups, with a total of more than 4,000 piculs of goods. The sales field in this street was still light. Both the North and South Oceans' groups only handled 700 to 800 packages, so the situation was tired, and the market situation was soft. The market for thick early japonica and thin indica rice both saw a few cents decline. Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan both showed soft signs.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than ten boats from various sources under the river. The market had various goods going to the stomach. White japonica rice slightly turned active, but the sales of high-inferior goods were still weak. The price of high-inferior was stable, and those in the middle were tightly buckled by several cents to nearly a dime. Yinbianyuan and thin indica rice had a slight outlet, the price was stable, and the prices of each indica and other goods were all stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sales of Hakka indica rice were still active. Quanzhou groups and the mainland continued to inquire. The market was also fragrant, and the rumors on the market were very prevalent in recent days. Stockholders also held their inventory. Commodity owners shouted up prices and stepped up. Therefore, the intermediate rice in the active sales rose by three or four cents, and the high-priced goods with scarce arrivals and inventory rose by four or five cents. Fever rice has been sold out, and the market can stand up. A total of 5,000 packages of Gan rice, 700 packages of Zhejiang rice, 1,000 packages of Wental rice, and 200 packages of Jiangbei rice were opened throughout the day. The mainland and Quanzhou only inquired about Jiangxi machine rice, and the rest were all handled by this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than 900 packages of new Wenzhou broad beans arrived at the port. The quality of the goods was uneven, and the outlet was not greedy, causing the market price to fall by one or two dimes. A total of more than 390 packages were opened, the price was 4.4 yuan to 3.9 yuan, and were advanced by the Tianjin group and the Leyang group. Yellow soybeans continued to tighten by four or five cents due to the rising price of oil cake (soybean cake rose by two cents and soybean oil rose by one or two dimes). According to manufacturers, Yingzhou Haobang beans were handled for each car, and the mainland, etc. inquired. Harbin beans were handled for four cars, Andong beans were handled for 65 packages, and Dudou Shayellow was handled for 800 to 900 packages, it is said.</p>

<p>A certain vegetable: High-priced goods have not been produced in a long time, and there has been a long-term shortage in this city. Yesterday, it was slightly loaded. A total of 50 packages of high-priced Western vegetables were sold, the marked price was 17.3 yuan. Another 45 packages of unified Western vegetables were sold, the price was 16.5 yuan, and the vendors sold them. The customer side is very eager to sell, so the main hands are unusually brisk.</p>
<p>Dried mussels: The source of Japanese goods is gradually strong, but the Sichuan-Hankou group's needs are also gradually becoming lively, so they are sold as soon as they arrive. There is no accumulation in the province. The market in the vendors is not only not loose, but also has a tendency to increase. Yesterday, the marked price for five boxes of large size goods was 78 yuan, and the marked price for 13 boxes of Tongshou goods was 72.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Shi Fan Ginseng: New goods have not yet been launched, and both old goods and inventory are lacking. However, due to the continuous import of smuggled goods in the north, the customer route has been greatly hit, making it difficult for the market to turn around. Yesterday, 70 branches arrived, and the number of good goods on the road was seven boxes, and the marked price was only 223 yuan. However, the vendors' advancing stomach was very lazy, and they were barely assigned, it is said.</p>
<p>Dried Scallops: At the moment, business is between the falling orders. Customers in various ports rarely purchase. However, this street and the inner road groups have a slight sales stomach, but they are only scattered, and the quantity is extremely small. Yesterday, the marked price for the sale of nine boxes of the correct medium grain was 158 yuan, and the marked price for five boxes of large medium grain was 156 yuan, a decrease of five or six yuan compared to the previous plate.</p>

<p>Since Sichuan pickled mustard has been rising, the arrival of goods has been quite strong in recent days, reaching a total of 6,000 +. The original price of high-priced goods continues to open, and the market situation is not easy to turn loose for a while. However, ordinary goods are relatively flat and soft. Old goods are also traded around 20 yuan. Yesterday's vendor plate did not change much, and the appetite was still good. The market situation had a tendency to stabilize.</p>
<p>Due to the long-term silence and lack of movement in Guangdong sales, the market situation of white hyacinth beans continued to trend downstream. It was found that the previous market was 8.5 yuan, but recently the sales stomach has been only sporadic and has gradually returned to low levels. Yesterday, the market was only sold at 8 yuan, a small decrease of half a yuan before and after, but the transaction was still not smooth. However, even if the market price is smaller at this point, it is estimated that it will be limited. If the Guangdong sales are once vigorous, there is hope for a rebound.</p>
<p>The sales of Xiamen orange cakes are still extremely sporadic. In fact, the sales order has not arrived, and Wenzhou cakes are extremely cheap, so the vendor plate is difficult to shake. Yesterday, it was heard that there were slightly opening offers in the dark plate, a few corners smaller than before, but there were still few transactions, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the grain market's human hearts turned better as private smuggling has become increasingly tight recently. The public association's disc split 24 rough sand white spot price was 22 yuan, and the transshipment goods rose by another dime, calling for 6.9 yuan. Dongchibai was also gradually firming. The spot price (MS) mark was 21.35 yuan, the No. 9 was 21.15 yuan, the transshipment goods No. 4 was 7.15 yuan, the No. 8 was 6.75 yuan, and the No. 9 was 6.3 yuan. This factory's cotton white had no movement. There was a vendor plate opened by the Chaozhou group for more than a hundred packages of Ban Nan Qing, the price was 9.55 yuan. It was heard that the production price of Xinghua Da Gongbai had risen by seven or eight corners before and after, so the source was very scarce. After the Shanghai market opened and rose by half a yuan, yesterday it opened again at 17.6 yuan, and then tightened by another dime. Guangdong group Hui 17.56 yuan, and there were scattered transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday was also the exchange period for the combined group company, and the total quota for Guangdong rough white, etc. was 9,862 packages.

<h3 id="e252">Treatment Method for Sexual Neurasthenia <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>The human nervous system is densely distributed throughout the body. The main trunk is in the brain, called the brain nerve. The main trunk is in the spine, called the spinal cord nerve. Those in the genital area are called sexual nerves.</p>
<p>The nerves in each part are closely related. Therefore, if a part of the nerve is weak, the other parts are affected. If the delay is left untreated, the result will be the neurasthenia of the whole body.</p>
<p>Whether the nervous system is sound or not depends on whether the endocrine nutrition of the glands is good or not. The importance of the endocrine of the gonads is the crown of all glands in the body.</p>
<p>Gonadal endocrine is not only most closely related to the sexual nervous system, but also has a direct nourishing effect on the brain nerves and spinal cord nerves.</p>
<p>The most important and common symptoms of sexual neurasthenia are premature ejaculation, kidney failure, and nocturnal emission. Collectively referred to as sexual diseases. The most correct treatment is the gonad preparation "Gonadin". If it can also be treated with electrotherapy at the same time, the treatment will be faster.</p>
<h3 id="e253">(I) Nocturnal Emission and Dream Emission <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Although there is a distinction between dreaming and dreamless in the case of nocturnal emission, the source of the disease is the same. Therefore, the treatment method is also the same.</p>
<p>In addition to taking "Gonadin", this disease should also be taken with "Hemitol Sperm-Strengthening Tablets". It is said that the vas deferens of patients with this disease feels relaxed.</p>
<p>This spring, a young patient, Mr. Zhu Jinlong, came to complain that he had more than ten nocturnal emissions every month. Excessive leakage caused sperm loss, weak brain, blood depletion, neurasthenia, and insomnia, forgetfulness, yellow face, and thin muscles. After I asked him to buy and take "Hemitol Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to treat his leakage, and take "Gonadin" to supplement his sperm, brain, energy, and blood, after a month or so, all symptoms were cured and he recovered strongly, such as celebrating rebirth.</p>
<h3 id="e254">(II) Premature Ejaculation and Spermatorrhea <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Premature ejaculation varies in severity. Some ejaculate as soon as they have intercourse, some ejaculate before intercourse is pleasant, and some even ejaculate when they see color and cannot control it. All of this is caused by sexual neurasthenia. The gonad preparation "Gonadin" should be taken immediately to raise its weakness and restore its prosperity before it can be rebuilt. If you want quick results, it is more appropriate to receive electrotherapy at the same time.</p>
<p>At the beginning of spring, Mr. Lu Zhennan came to complain that he suffered from severe premature ejaculation. In addition to instructing him to purchase "Gonadin" from Zhengwei Pharmacy, I also introduced him to Dr. Zhan Nianceng's place for electrotherapy. For a month, the chronic disease was removed and life was restarted. It was like another world before and after.</p>
<h3 id="e255">(III) Impotence and Small Sexuality <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>General neurasthenia will cause thinness and incomplete development, while sexual neurasthenia will prevent local development and cause weakness or shortness. The pathology is in the decline of the gonads and the lack of gonad endocrine. Therefore, the treatment method is to use the gonad preparation "Gonadin" as the most correct treatment.</p>
<p>Gonad preparations are used to treat sexually transmitted diseases and can be extremely effective. Therefore, various tonics on the market compete to use gonad preparations as their label. In fact, those that are truly refined using gonad endocrine, based on our clinical experience, are the purest and best with "Gonadin". Used to treat various symptoms of gonadal decline, they can achieve the most satisfactory special effects. Recently, I have repeatedly used it to cure Mr. You Wo Xing's premature ejaculation, Mr. Lin Yan Ting's impotence, and Mr. Qi Foqing's small sexuality. All of them achieved the effects of medicine to cure the disease and quick treatment.</p>

<p>(1) A Case of Kidney Deficiency and Lower Back Pain Cured by Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>Patient: Sun Daquan, 42 years old, from Ningbo, businessman. Six or seven years ago, Mr. Sun suffered from lower back pain and took various medications. Later, due to various inconveniences, he wanted to quit smoking. The pain recurred and was more severe than before. Unable to avoid it, he continued to smoke until now. Recently, the government has been strictly cracking down on drugs and strictly ordering people to quit smoking. It is difficult to continue. He decided to remove the kidney deficiency first and then try to quit smoking to avoid suffering. He was introduced to me by his cousin, Mr. Wu Jiliang, for treatment. Based on my clinical experience, "Reproductive Essence" can not only treat weakness symptoms such as kidney deficiency and lower back pain, but also has the effect of eliminating tobacco toxins. I immediately instructed him to get it from Wuzhou Pharmacy and take it. After taking it, he didn't feel like smoking. After taking several boxes in a row, he felt disgusted by the smell of smoke. The smoking addiction was eliminated, and the kidney disease disappeared. He happily thanked me and left.</p>
<p>(2) Common Problems of Young People: Insomnia and Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Patient: Shi Yunyu, 26 years old, from Jiangning, in the academic world. When Mr. Shi was young, he was tempted by bad friends and mistakenly committed masturbation, resulting in spermatorrhea. He suffered from insomnia and memory loss, which was extremely painful. He bought and took tonics, but they were not very effective. The frequency of spermatorrhea increased, and the symptoms of weakness became more and more severe. He suffered from headaches and brain swelling, mental fatigue, and physical exhaustion. He was tired of everything, his studies declined sharply, and his body was weak. This spring, he saw that his classmate Zhang Ximing, who also suffered from spermatorrhea, was cured by me, so he asked him to introduce him to me for treatment. I performed electrotherapy on him and instructed him to buy "Hymatol's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" and "Reproductive Essence" from Taihe Pharmacy and take them for half a dozen courses. Spermatorrhea was completely cured, weakness was reversed, his spirits were refreshed, his muscles were full, and his state of health was unprecedented.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays. Closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>Famous Medicine Cures Premature Ejaculation and Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Patient: One Zhong, 37 years old, from Tianjin, has been doing business in Shanghai for many years. Mr. Zhong previously engaged in social activities due to business and became involved with prostitutes. He contracted venereal diseases. Fortunately, he was cured by injections and medication. However, the seminal glands have been destroyed. Premature ejaculation is very severe. He sought medical treatment and took medication, but there was no effective verification. His body gradually weakened, and all kinds of diseases arose. There was nominal, not real intimacy between husband and wife. Emotions faded, and ridicule increased frequently. His nerves were stimulated, and he was in a state of weakness. He suffered from body tremors, cold limbs, dizziness, blurred vision, lower back pain, forgetfulness, and insomnia. His career was greatly affected. Although he was middle-aged and strong, he was already showing signs of aging. After many inquiries, he came to me for treatment this spring. I observed that Mr. Zhong's premature ejaculation was very severe. In addition to performing the latest scientific surgical electrotherapy, I also instructed him to buy "Reproductive Essence" from Zhongxi Pharmacy to replenish his losses. I also told him about health preservation methods. In less than a month, premature ejaculation was cured, and all symptoms disappeared.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and Many Dreams Reborn in Chongqing</p>
<p>Patient: Pan Ruchun, 25 years old, from Jiading, works in a factory. Mr. Pan mistakenly committed masturbation eight or nine years ago. It became a long-term habit, and the consumption was very serious. He began to quit only after getting engaged. However, he still could not completely quit. Before long, he suddenly suffered from spermatorrhea. He could not sleep peacefully every night. His dreams were chaotic and full of erotic thoughts. In a daze, sperm was ejaculated. He felt extremely frustrated upon waking up. He suffered from dizziness, blurred vision, and exhaustion. Although he repeatedly sought medical treatment and took medication, the effects were very poor. The frequency of spermatorrhea gradually increased. The loss became more and more severe, and he was even more exhausted. He suffered from all kinds of diseases and was in a miserable state. Later, in mid-March this spring, he was introduced to me by his colleague Mr. Lu for treatment. I instructed him to buy "Hymatol's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" and "Reproductive Essence" from Wing On Company to treat his spermatorrhea and replenish his losses. After taking it for several days, the spermatorrhea gradually improved. After taking several more boxes, the spermatorrhea was completely cured. After taking about half a dozen courses, his body recovered, and his spirits were strong. Mr. Pan said it was like being reborn in Chongqing.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Women's Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e262">Talking About the Past of the Women's Liberation Movement <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Qiuying</p>
<p>Men and women are both "round-headed and square-footed, with horizontal eyes and intelligent hearts." In principle, they should enjoy equal rights, but in the past, men were considered people, while women seemed to be objects, appendages possessed by men. They did not have equal opportunities for education, equal opportunities in employment, or equal opportunities for political participation. There was a clear inequality between men and women.</p>
<p>Since the women's liberation movement began, some women have consciously and actively risen up to demand liberation. They want to be treated as equal human beings and gain the rights they deserve, which are: equal education, equal employment, and equal political participation.</p>
<p>Now, the equality demanded by women has nominally been achieved and the goal has been reached, but the actual achievements are pitifully small! Those who can enjoy equal education, those who can find equal employment, and those who can participate in equal political participation are still only a small minority. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The Women's Movement Cannot Have Majority Participation. The main conditions for any movement are: 1. Voluntariness, 2. Majority participation. One's own suffering is best understood by oneself, so one needs to rise up and liberate oneself. Liberation that is not voluntary has no value even if it succeeds. As the saying goes, "Zhao Meng can be honored, Zhao Meng can be debased," which is also very dangerous. The participation of the majority gives the movement strength. If a few people rise up and work enthusiastically, but the majority are muddle-headed, unaware, and do not rise up to cooperate, then it will not succeed. Even if it succeeds by chance, it will not be thorough. The reason why the past liberation movement could not achieve complete success and could not have the participation of the majority is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Knowledge Is Not Equal. Zhuangzi said, "If the accumulation of water is not deep, then it will not have the strength to carry a large boat." We can know that to accomplish anything and fulfill one's mission, there is no shortcut other than doing well in one's studies and improving one's knowledge and ability. However, the fact that women in the past did not have enough academic ability cannot be denied. The reason why their academic ability was not enough was because men and women did not have equal opportunities for education. As the Western saying goes, "Power that is not sought on the basis of knowledge is absolutely unattainable, and even if it is obtained by luck, it is absolutely impossible to maintain." Therefore, in the women's movement, women must first cultivate their strength, do less empty talk, and strive to improve their knowledge and ability to stand on an equal footing with men. The reason why the past women's movement could not achieve complete success is that their academic ability was not enough, which is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Therefore, my conclusion is: To achieve complete success in the women's movement, first, the majority of women must participate and cooperate together; second, women must cultivate their knowledge and ability to stand on an equal footing with men! Otherwise, there will only be the empty name of women's liberation, without the reality of women's liberation!</p>
<h3 id="e263">The Past and Present of "Turkish" Women <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Tian</p>
<p>During the time of the Sultans, "Turkish" women were almost completely oppressed under the tyrannical power of men. Every young girl, after undergoing a so-called "perfunctory" education, was considered an adult woman. At that time, they should put on a thin veil on their faces, covering their youthful faces day and night, and no man other than their father and brothers could see their face. Going out was rare. Even if they encountered something important that required them to go out, they would be accompanied by other women. As for the veil, they always carefully protected it, never letting a gust of wind blow it open for strange men to see. Otherwise, it might lead to others pointing fingers: "Hmph! This woman is so promiscuous!"</p>
<p>At home, they just ate and chatted. Except for a few farm girls who worked in the fields with their faces exposed, it was very difficult for almost all women to succeed in doing things in society.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen or seventeen, it was also the time for them to get married and remove their veils, following the evil traditions passed down by their ancestors to marry a man they had never met. But how pitiful it was! When her husband felt like abandoning her, all he needed was a letter of divorce and two people to prove that he did not need her as his wife. The branch rudder was in that situation, helplessly carrying endless sorrow, quietly leaving her husband's home.</p>
<p>A gentleman from the property-owning class would bring a woman called a Halalk from the slave market home. If the Halalk gave birth to a son for him, she would be promoted to the class called Odalik under his control, and become one of his master's wives. Furthermore, daughters of the aristocratic class during the Sultanate period often married sons of a lower rank. Rarely would a governor's son marry another governor's daughter. From this, one can see the painful life of "Turkish" women at that time. Legally, women had no status, and in the eyes of men, they were equal to a toy. Therefore, in every polygamous family at that time, disputes between wives and concubines were often seen.</p>
<p>However, General Kemal, over the past ten years, has broken through the various obstacles of old habits and created a new order. As a result, the women's issue has been liberated, and the status of women has also progressed accordingly. At the same time, the "Turkish" Republic was established a few years ago. This has transformed an old-fashioned Turkey into one that is similar to European countries.</p>
<p>Women after the reform, "civil servants" that could not be done before, have now been completely overturned: female lawyers and female judges in courts, news reporters in newspapers. In education, they also have the same rights as men to enter middle school and take college entrance exams. Divorce and marriage are also carried out in accordance with the laws of Western countries. At least polygamy and the habit of wearing veils have been completely abolished.</p>
<p>In all new environments, the intelligence and character of Turkish women have been significantly affected. They are absolutely not as bound as they were in the veil era. They actually engage in free love. Other aspects of life, such as everything in the family, have also improved rapidly.</p>
<p>Turkish women are completely in the tide of liberation. It is remembered that in 1932, the Turkish Queen Haunm was elected Miss World. At that time, they achieved a glorious victory in the women's world of the national sports group.</p>
<p>Turkish women are no longer what they used to be. Their improvements are really fast. However, they are always grateful to their Kemal.</p>

<p>— Gao Geng</p>
<p>The morning alarm clock rings incessantly, but the women turn over and go back to sleep. They sleep more than men and sleep more easily and quietly.</p>
<p>Many experts have studied the problem of sleep and dreams. The result is that men mostly have nightmares because they have more work and worries.</p>
<p>They further say that dreaming is not a necessary element of complete sleep, but constant nightmares are a symbol of physical unsoundness. He also believes that seven hours of sleep is enough for people over the age of thirteen.</p>
<p>A rough blanket or even a hot water bottle can cause nightmares. Some very strange dreams are caused by hot water bottles placed under the feet.</p>
<p>We dream very quickly. Events that often take an hour to describe can occur in dreams in just one or two minutes. When we are assassinated in a dream or encounter some frightening event, we wake up and see that it is just the rattling of the window or the banging of the door. Sometimes it is even the ticking of the clock!</p>
<p>The expert suggests that if you cannot fall asleep, you can close your eyelids and focus on the center of your forehead. This is the natural position of the eyes after a person falls asleep. Doing so can clear your mind and gradually fall asleep.</p>
<p>Many great people have the characteristic of sleeping little. The reason why their short periods of sleep can restore their body and mind is entirely due to the pleasantness of their sleep.</p>
<h3 id="e265">This Year Is the 30th Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Pioneer Qiu Jin <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Daisy</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese sayings have traditionally regarded thirty years as one generation, and reaching the age of sixty is called a full cycle of the zodiac, which is slightly different from the Western custom of regarding one hundred years as a century, but they can complement each other. The Western saying that one hundred years is a century represents one "life," while the Chinese thirty years represents one "generation." Examining the Chinese translation of the French word Siecle as "century," although it is unknown who created it, tracing its etymology reveals that the French word Siecle is originally derived from the Latin word Saeculum, which means generation. Just as the Latin word Aetas, meaning age, can be understood as one hundred years or thirty years, as in the ancient poem Nuoc terta vivitur aetas, where "three generations" means thirty years as one generation. The poems written by Plautus and Terentius all regarded one hundred years as a generation. The creation and evolution of the languages of the two ancient civilizations of the East and West have unexpectedly coincided. Therefore, our Chinese reverence for modern martyrs and sages can also adopt the saying of thirty years as one generation to replace the grand ceremonies held every one hundred years or twenty-five years in Western countries. Since June of the Dingwei year when the female knight Qiu Jin was executed at Xuantingkou, it will soon be the thirtieth anniversary. If major newspapers in the country can collect anecdotes and poems with a more enduring time scale, it may be possible to designate the thirtieth year as "Qiu Jin Year." Here are two seven-character律詩 poems commemorating Wan Ye Qiu Jin Year, to solicit comments from comrades at home and abroad. The poems say:</p>
<p>Her amazing talent and unique style met the autumn knight,</p>
<p>A beautiful woman who left the world, resembling a sword immortal.</p>
<p>Martyred for the country, she was more virtuous than Xi Shi,</p>
<p>Her earth-shattering deeds are unparalleled by Nuwa's legends.</p>
<p>Sharpening her knife in the Yellow Sea, she sang as if crying,</p>
<p>Boiling blood in Xuanting, her passion seemed to ignite.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, in this very place,</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of the city and the Jian Lake boat bear witness.</p>
<p>The jade dew withers, and grief is shared with Du Mei,</p>
<p>The cemetery's ice and snow shine with hidden plums.</p>
<p>Achieving benevolence and seeing righteousness are heroic deeds,</p>
<p>Her talent as a prime minister rivals Cang Shui and Wen Shan.</p>
<p>The spirit of nation-building fills the universe,</p>
<p>The flowers and trees blooming early respond to the wind and thunder.</p>
<p>Qiu Jin and Yu Jin are truly unparalleled,</p>
<p>After mourning Zhou Lang, we return here again.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Interview with Western Painter Ms. Pan Yuliang <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The night before yesterday, I was chatting at Liu Haisu's house and unintentionally talked about several successful Western painters in China. Haisu is truly an artistic rebel. He is very strict when criticizing others. In his eyes, there are simply not many, especially women. We were talking enthusiastically when suddenly a woman in a Western suit came in. That was Ms. Pan Yuliang. She is one of the top Western painters. For the past twenty years, she has traveled all over Europe and Asia and has had special success with oil painting. Probably no one who has seen her work would deny that. That night, I also talked with her for half an hour and learned that her past experiences were very difficult. She lost her husband one month after birth and her mother at the age of eight. She grew up relying on her uncle. She said, "People have loving parents, but I only have kind uncles and aunts." She got married at the age of nineteen, had a child, and then went to Europe to study. The scene of her studying hard abroad back then was also quite interesting. Here, I have written down her conversations in a mixed way:</p>
<p>Artistic Life</p>
<p>I first asked her to report on her artistic life over the past twenty years. She said, "I have always liked art since I was a child. Now I can continue to make a living in the art world and have become a lifelong professional. My courage is very strong, and I have been able to grasp my own aspirations. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, I graduated from the Art College and received a subsidy from Anhui Province to study in France. I entered the Paris Art College, graduated in four years, and learned a little about the field. I then went to the Italian Academy of Fine Arts to study ancient European art. I was the first Eastern woman to study there, so the teachers and students looked at me with different eyes. I was a struggling student, and the provincial funds were in arrears and not paid. Sometimes, only thirty or fifty yuan were remitted, not a round number. I boarded with people and barely paid the boarding fee. I took care of my own meals. Sometimes I bought a few pieces of bread just to fill my stomach. It was unbearably bitter. In my third year of study, I received the Royal Prize of 5,000 lira, which was the first honor in my life. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, I returned to China and served as a professor in the Art Department of Central University for six years. Now, I have accepted an invitation from the Art College to serve my alma mater. In my life, I most like to travel to mountains and rivers, such as Fushan, Jiuhua, Taishan, Putuo, Huashan, Zhongnan, Xuefeng, Tiantai, Yandang, Huangshan, Laoshan, etc. I travel alone and make a living along the way. Over the years, I have created more than 200 works, which are scheduled to be exhibited at the Zhonghua Academic Society starting on June 2nd. Please give me your guidance from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign."</p>
<p>Urban and Rural Women</p>
<p>Since Ms. has traveled to various provinces, she is naturally very clear about the situation in rural areas. So, what are her impressions of women in urban and rural areas? I asked her this.</p>
<p>"I have always admired the working spirit of European rural women. Over the years, I have walked through several provinces in the north and south and have come to believe that the working ability and thrifty virtues of rural women in our country are actually superior. It seems that there is no distinction between men and women in the countryside. They all operate in the same way, and their physiques are equally strong. Women also have to take care of household affairs. Sometimes, when their husbands go out, they take on all the responsibilities of household affairs and farming. This is something that people in the city cannot match. They only have one regret, which is that they do not have the opportunity to receive education, and their knowledge is too shallow. Their mental abilities are not sharp enough. As for urban women, especially in Shanghai, they are really too extravagant. Excessive decoration wastes time and money, which is a great pity! I am not opposed to it, but I advocate having a certain limit, otherwise, the gains will not outweigh the losses. It always gives people a bad impression. Some things should be done by themselves, and there is no need to leave everything to servants. They must also know themselves, not be delusional, not admire vanity, and reflect on whether my thoughts, knowledge, and integrity are suitable for modern society? Whether my way of dealing with people is beneficial to the public? I hope that today's Chinese men and women will achieve true equal status—" These are her few powerful words.</p>
<p>The Way of Husband and Wife</p>
<p>I also asked her what her insights were on the way of husband and wife. She said, "Between husband and wife, the first thing is sincerity. Neither party can tolerate perfunctory or arrogant tempers. Perfunctoriness can only last for a while, and it can never last. Suspicion is even more intolerable. Often, one thing is hidden, and a gap arises, which turns falsehood into truth, and even the truth becomes false. Conflicts are inevitable between husband and wife. There must be a peaceful attitude. Facts speak louder than words. Concede at the time and explain afterward. What cannot be understood? In some families, economic independence leads to all kinds of drawbacks. Women can accumulate savings, while men are prone to squandering, and even end up losing their wealth and reputation. I advocate economic openness and implementing a family accounting system. Husband and wife cannot live together all year round. There must be several short periods of separation, which is also a way to maintain conjugal love."</p>
<p>Finally, I found a chalk drawing of a fugitive in her bookcase. I stared at this great man. Although he was a fugitive, his spirit was extraordinary. Therefore, I have printed it above.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Fugitive <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>

<h3 id="e269">Postpartum Exercise for Women <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Taihua</p>
<p>During pregnancy, the abdominal muscles of the parturient woman are stretched as much as possible due to the enlargement of the uterus; the vaginal muscles are also excessively enlarged when the fetus is delivered through the vagina; the anal sphincter muscles are also enlarged along with the levator ani muscle due to the force exerted during childbirth. Therefore, after childbirth, the abdominal muscles will be permanently relaxed, and the original tension will disappear, or the abdomen will droop downward, the vaginal muscles will become relaxed and enlarged, and the anus will prolapse and incontinence of feces and farts will occur. To prevent the above-mentioned sequelae, the following postpartum exercise method is presented for postpartum women to implement in accordance with the law. The various postpartum exercise methods mentioned below contain the following benefits and functions: 1. They can restore the normal position of the uterus and help the uterus contract and recover; 2. They can restore the tension of the muscles and prevent the abdominal muscles from becoming relaxed and sagging; 3. They can restore the strength of the gluteal and leg muscles and prevent the limbs from becoming soft and weak after childbirth; 4. They can restore the contraction force of the vaginal and anal muscles and prevent the vaginal and anal muscles from becoming relaxed; 5. They can improve the relaxed systemic muscle strength after childbirth, increase the appetite of the parturient woman, and promote mammary gland secretion. Therefore, normal parturient women should implement it in accordance with the law for the sake of health and the beauty of body posture; if the parturient woman has abnormal delivery and postpartum diseases and perineal rupture, the date of starting exercise must be postponed.</p>
<p>Hand Exercise Method: Starting from the first day after childbirth, you can lie on the bed to perform it. For hand exercises, perform it three times a day for three minutes each time in the first week, and four times a day for five minutes each time afterward. When performing it, you must use force on the muscles of the fingers and buttocks.</p>
<p>Uterine Recovery Exercise Method: The best way to recover the entire uterus is for the parturient woman to breastfeed herself. However, the uterus is vagrant, especially during the process of muscle and ligament contraction and recovery. Due to the posture of lying in bed after childbirth, the uterus will change its position at any time. If you lie on one side for a long time, the uterus will be fixed and tilted to that side, forming various uterine displacement diseases. Therefore, you should lie on your back for three hours after childbirth, and then alternate between lying on your left side, right side, and back, with an average rotation. However, each time you turn over, you must be careful and slow, and you must not move or twist suddenly. You must also use your hands to support and press the abdomen and uterus. If the perineum has been sutured, you must first put your legs together when turning over. After three days after childbirth, turn over and lie prone once every twelve hours, for a quarter of an hour each time; starting from the fourth day, add crawling exercises on the bed each time you lie prone; after the fifth day, add the knee-chest lying method as shown in Figure A, because crawling exercises, the knee-chest lying method, and lying prone can all prevent uterine prolapse and have a great effect on abdominal muscle contraction.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Illustration A: Postnatal Knee-Chest Position Method <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Abdominal Muscle Exercise Method: Two days postpartum, lie supine with legs extended and mouth closed. Use the nose for shallow and deep breathing, inhaling with full force to contract the abdomen, making the abdominal muscles contract and sink as much as possible. Raise and expand the chest, using the power from the lower abdomen (dantian) to inhale deeply. When exhaling, exhale slowly and gradually without using abdominal force. When performing the exercise, place a light bowl or cup on the abdomen. Then, lie on the left and right sides, performing shallow and deep breathing as above, contracting the left and right abdominal muscles. Initially, perform this exercise once in the morning and evening, each time breathing five times. After four days, when performing this method, the supine position with arms and legs extended can be changed to a supine position with knees bent and side lying as in Illustration B. At the same time, increase the frequency to once every six hours. Crawling exercise on the bed: Because the exertion of the chest, shoulders, and hands during crawling naturally causes the abdominal muscles to contract, it is also very effective for restoring abdominal muscles. Starting from the sixth day postpartum, in addition to the above exercise methods, the upper body sit-up exercise method can be added as shown in the figure below, sitting up six times each time, twice a day. Starting from the fifteenth day postpartum, add the standing upper body bend-down exercise method, twice a day, three minutes each time. If the weather is warm, it is best to perform this exercise in sunlight. As for the old method of tightly binding the abdomen with an abdominal binder, it has now been proven ineffective for restoring abdominal muscles and preventing abdominal enlargement and sagging. Some doctors also say that using Aboba Zhunyu to rub the abdominal skin can effectively reduce abdominal skin wrinkles, but this is also inaccurate. Therefore, the restoration of abdominal muscles can only be effectively achieved by performing the various exercise methods mentioned above. However, when postpartum women get out of bed, wrapping an abdominal binder can indeed make the abdomen feel more comfortable.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Illustration B: Knee-Bent Supine Shallow Breathing, Deep Breathing, Contracting Abdominal Muscles <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Vaginal Muscle Exercise Method: When the fetus is delivered through the vagina, the fetal head excessively dilates the vagina. Therefore, postpartum women should start three days postpartum and automatically contract the vaginal muscles twice every hour, with each contraction lasting half a minute to one minute. In this way, the vaginal muscles can contract and restore, preventing vaginal muscle relaxation after childbirth.</p>
<p>Anal Muscle Exercise Method: Starting three days postpartum, automatically contract the anus once every two hours.</p>
<p>Foot Exercise Method: Start performing this exercise three days postpartum. First, raise the left foot, then the right foot, and then raise both feet together. During the exercise, the toes, calves, and thighs must exert force. However, those who have had perineal sutures must start performing this exercise two weeks later.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Pitiful Northwestern Women <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Di Cang</p>
<p>Since Rousseau's "Naturalism" and the concept of "Natural Rights" led to the French Revolution, it indirectly triggered the women's movement. Women in various countries have successively fought for their status. Backward Chinese women, after the first year of the Republic of China, have also made considerable progress in the status of women. But upon closer examination, only a very small number of "Heaven's favored daughters" have enjoyed some superficial liberation. The majority of women, however, are still doing men's playthings, living a miserable life of cattle and horse labor!</p>
<p>Northwestern women, who are in a place where feudal ideas are strong, society is unstable, and the rural economy is bankrupt, are sinking into the deep pit of the old ethics. Foot binding, ear piercing, lack of education, and all kinds of suffering, marriage is still arranged by parents and matchmakers, no different from a kind of salable creature. They have no human status at all. Slaves are brutally beaten by their mistresses, daughters-in-law are abused by their parents-in-law, wives are oppressed and abandoned by their husbands, which is generally considered to be a matter of course. After the death of her husband, she must observe chastity, and tragedies such as suttee and burying young widows alive are commonplace. They themselves also think that this is "virtue". The scourge of the old ethics has ruined many young women.</p>
<p>As for the enjoyment of education and the right to participate in politics and inherit, it is only to create value for the daughters of the parasitic class. The young ladies only know to compete for beauty in school and to compete for favor in front of the opposite sex; once married, they are other people's people, only knowing the "three obediences and four virtues." The hard-working women trapped in the countryside cannot even maintain their own minimum living standards of cattle and horses. How can they take care of these problems? Apart from secretly envying their vanity, they can only lament their own poor fate.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most of the knowledgeable women in the southeast are only intoxicated in the bright lights and green wine of the dance halls, dreaming of being wives and grandmothers. How many are still continuing to work hard, preparing to go deep into the masses of hard-working women, to be their guides and pioneers, to save those women who are living inhuman lives in the hell on earth, to create happiness for the masses of women, and to remember the powerless northwestern women who cannot rise up!</p>
<h3 id="e273">To Sister Fen Staying in Nara, Japan <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>—Second Letter—</p>
<p>Fen, I don't know if you have seen the first letter I sent three days ago? What are your thoughts after seeing it? It's best to tell me some.</p>
<p>I don't admit that I am a complainer, but since "returning to the motherland," the complaints in my stomach have really been accumulating more and more, to the point where I have to complain; however, I still don't want to add a layer of depression to you every time you receive a letter from me, so today I am determined to put everything else aside and just tell you a very interesting romantic story, so you can laugh a little.</p>
<p>Aren't I staying at my eldest sister's house? And the room they assigned me to stay in is right behind my eldest sister's own bedroom. Although there is a wall between them, I can still hear all the sounds. The night before yesterday, around one o'clock, I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise. I listened intently and found that it was my eldest sister arguing with my brother-in-law because he has been coming home very late every day recently. This is a very normal thing, who would bother to listen to them. Unexpectedly, the quarrel became more and more fierce later, my eldest sister cried, and Xiao Ling also cried. Then I heard a bang, and my brother-in-law slammed the door shut and stormed out with very loud and rough footsteps.</p>
<p>When things got to this point, someone had to go out and mediate. But before I could get dressed, my brother-in-law had already left through the back door, leaving only my eldest sister and Xiao Ling crying together. It was only with the help of Liu Ma that we managed to stop them from crying. Then, my eldest sister told me with a gnashing expression that my brother-in-law had an affair and was going to live together outside soon, so the family's finances are now very tight, and even Xiao Ling's tuition fees cannot be paid, but my brother-in-law still doesn't care. Finally, my eldest sister announced a countermeasure, which was to file a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Although I am not a supporter of the "litigation is always unlucky" theory, I also oppose creating social news material for the newspapers for the sake of family disputes. Therefore, I strongly advised my eldest sister not to implement her own proposal and promised to come up with a better countermeasure for her.</p>
<p>This sleep was ruined by them! My eldest sister first told me one by one many details that had been hidden, and there were enough words to fill two baskets, but to pick out a few points to clarify the situation:</p>
<p>Seven months ago, my brother-in-law had a romance with a female colleague surnamed Liu;</p>
<p>According to my eldest sister's investigation, although the other party often lives and mingles with my brother-in-law, she is not very frivolous in nature, and her family education is also very strict, so the two have not had any improper behavior;</p>
<p>The other party asked my brother-in-law to divorce my eldest sister first, and then talk about marriage;</p>
<p>My brother-in-law really intends to propose a divorce to my eldest sister. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e274">Aviation to Save the Nation and Dancing to Save the Nation <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Standing in today's world, air defense is quite important. For example, Abyssinia is said to have failed because it had no air defense. Therefore, when they saw Italian planes coming, they had to hide. Although in addition to airplanes, the "importers of civilization" seemed to have poisonous gas bombs to fumigate the "barbarian people" like mosquitoes, in short, suffering from the lack of air defense was still quite a lot.</p>
<p>Speaking of something more personal, then it is best to look at the January 28th Incident. Enemy planes dropped eggs in the sky over Zhabei. With a bang, black smoke rose everywhere, followed by a burst of fire. The common people in Zhabei were naturally crying everywhere, but the concessions were quiet. Quite a few "higher-class Chinese" opened rooms in large hotels to play cards and act as observation posts for "watching the fire from the other side." At that time, the International Hotel did not yet exist. Otherwise, I think it would be even more intimate and beautiful to look down from the International Hotel. Of course, the International Hotel has nothing to do with the "refugees." In addition to making the "fire watchers" happier, the lives and property of the refugees will still be destroyed by incendiary bombs and bombing bombs. However, this is enough to prove that China's air defense is not sound and needs to be well established.</p>
<p>As for dancing to save the nation, that's just a joke. Maybe the person who invented these four words still had a satirical effect. Otherwise, the sound of banning dancing would have disappeared long ago, which shows that dancing is ultimately harmful to "social security and the future of the entire nation." But it's not entirely true. For example, aviation donations are collected by seat in dance halls, but this is of course a profound intention to ban through taxation. Now it is a better method to use entertainment to expand aviation propaganda. Because in this erotic Shanghai, using "hula dances" and other things to appeal will definitely have a great effect. Didn't the previous flood relief entertainment use "flower selection" to appeal? So although the tickets are expensive, people from all walks of life are still eager to buy them, and at the same time, it is enough to see that the people's enthusiasm for supporting the expansion of the aviation to save the country movement is "very good."</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3 id="e275">Aviation Entertainment Fair at the International Hotel <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>——A Collection of Evening Dresses That Night</p>
<p>Just as our "friendly" strong neighbor was using a huge number of fighter jets carrying five hundred pound bombs to bomb China to death, Italian crow-like planes were bombing Abyssinia into a scorched earth. At this time, our China seems to be waking up.</p>
<p>Workers, elementary school students, and businessmen, they know "aviation to save the country." The power they can do is to save their pocket money, collect a few copper coins, and turn them into a whole number to buy airplanes and donate them to the government. They all have a fire-like heart, although after holding a ceremony, these airplanes are still put aside, but they still deeply believe that their airplanes will one day drive away the enemy.</p>
<p>There are too many things that come out of "aviation to save the country" that have nothing to do with "saving the country." Recently, we have also seen the "Aviation Entertainment Fair" held on the very high skyscraper of the International Hotel.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone should be happy. In China, where aviation is still quite young, who has a great interest in aviation. I believe that if this aviation entertainment fair was not held on the high skyscraper, but in a wilderness, there would definitely be a large number of aviation-enthusiastic people to enthusiastically participate.</p>
<p>I myself, like other aviation-enthusiastic people, really want to know if the "aviation to save the country" of the non-working class is the same as theirs. They must be shouting in their hearts: "Why is it held on the thirteenth floor? Why are you isolating us?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Li Dachao is not available. He said to give you a few books to read."</p>
<p>"Please return these books. We are not here to read books, we are here to interview for news. Please ask him again, does he entertain reporters?"</p>
<p>That trained attendant number 165 stood still, his face sinking:</p>
<p>"He said he's not available, so of course he doesn't entertain."</p>
<p>"We saw that trained attendant seemed to be Mr. Li Dachao's plenipotentiary representative, rejecting us like that. We wanted our business cards back, and didn't take the books he kindly gave us, and left.</p>
<p>We were thinking, think about it, why did he reject us? Could it be that the "Aviation Entertainment Fair" is just for the entertainment of the higher-class gentlemen? Does it have nothing to do with "aviation to save the country?" Does it not need widespread publicity?</p>
<p>But how can we tell the readers? All we saw were silver snake-like electric lights, red lanterns, black cars, evening dresses, two different faces of trained attendants, and a few yellow-faced books.</p>
<p>If the readers want to know the content of the entertainment fair, then I can only write about it abstractly based on their publicity:</p>
<p>Under the colored lights, on the half-drunk and pretentious faces of the gentlemen, sweat washed away the powder on their faces. Their eyes narrowed, their hands trembled. Many eyes hidden behind glasses, bulging out as if looking at the bare body in the center turning into a flea under the lights, making the gentlemen itch all over...</p>
<p>Readers! Miss ×'s performance of the "hula dance" may be even more moving than what I wrote, or maybe what I wrote is inaccurate? But what method do I have to tell the readers accurate news?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I felt that it was really necessary to write about the situation of this "Aviation Entertainment Fair" for everyone to see. So, in such a lively mood, I invited reporters from various newspapers to go together. On the way, I had already planned to come back and tell the readers the good news on paper about how many airplanes they had donated.</p>
<p>Very excitedly, I hurried there in the deep blue night. From afar, I saw the tall building of the black International Hotel, with its long string of electric lights, like a fiery red chain. In front of the door, two old-colored red lanterns for weddings were placed conspicuously. This is the Aviation Conference!</p>
<p>The car stopped non-stop at the door, and friends in evening dresses followed behind the evening dresses and went in. Watching them arrogantly step into the elevator, holding the powdered arms of fancy women</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>, when we were about to step in, the trained attendant number 165 of the International Hotel stopped us. We took out our business cards and told him to report to Mr. Li Dachao that we were here to interview for news. The attendant took the business cards and went up, and we waited for a reply on the sofa by the door.</p>
<p>Sitting on the sofa next to us was a Western couple in evening dresses. A compatriot of ours in an evening dress, bending his waist like a shrimp, was smiling and saying fluent English to the Western couple. The perfume emanating from his body, mixed with the unique breath of the Western race emanating from the Western lady's body, made people itchy.</p>
<p>I stood up and focused my gaze on the elevator entrance. The elevator was busy transporting evening dresses. The trained attendant was respectfully treating the owners of the evening dresses with fear of inadequate service.</p>
<p>An elevator brought down the trained attendant number 165 who had just taken our business cards up. He was holding a silver tray with a few yellow-faced books piled on it. He walked up, his face no longer smiling:</p>
<h3 id="e276">On the Songhua River <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Li</p>
<p>The sharp wind mixed with snowflakes and ice chips blown from Siberia angrily roared across this lonely night's wilderness, forest, and sparse villages...</p>
<p>Several feet of deep snow piled up on the ground, plump and delicate, looking like it was flowing slightly; the silvery-white color emitted a faint light in every corner of the earth, and this light was reflected on the ink-black sky, just like the thin morning mist in autumn morning, this faint light flowed on this dark wilderness, it replaced the task of the stars and moon to illuminate, so as not to make this rich wilderness fall into the abyss of darkness.</p>
<p>The forest, a boundless forest, stood silently, the huge treetops blurred in the dim air, facing the direction of the wind, the trunk was written with the snowy verses of the far north, it sang of the bitterness in it. Far away to the left rear of the forest, a long mountain range meandered, and the majestic outline was dyed with a layer of blurred thick night, as if it was a little withered, and as if it was about to stand up its strong chest and start a heroic fight with the darkness. Below it was the northern river—the Songhua River.</p>
<p>In spring, in summer, in autumn, (The Songhua River is like a strong child gradually growing into a heroic husband.) It roared and tumbled in the riverbed, it sprinkled tears on the beautiful riverbank, in its heart are buried some sad deeds, the deeds are increasing the record every day, and every accompanying event bites its heart, it is angry, it is sad, it cries, it wants to turn to the sky and pour out the sad record to mankind, it asks for a fair trial. …</p>
<p>Winter, the cold winter in the north, the torrent of the Songhua River is firmly sealed by thick ice, and the sound under the ice is not heard, as if it has been forgotten by people. —The frozen Songhua River has been thickly covered with snow, and it is only slightly different from the ground.</p>
<p>Dogs, a few military dogs, greedily twitched their noses and struggled to pull their legs and run towards the hard riverbed of the Songhua River. Closely following are a few loaded mule carts, swaying their bodies like drunkards from afar, climbing over with difficulty. The snow was brought by the wheels and made a low, muffled sound, and the sound gradually approached.</p>
<p>There were no other movements. Armed soldiers hung their guns diagonally and guarded the car door. The firelight of cigarettes lit up in their mouths. Some were dozing off, and some were projecting sharp eyes from under their leather hats towards the distance. They didn't talk. Not a word, silently waiting for what was about to happen. The dog running in the distance barked from time to time, and the sound seemed to be a little hoarse, as if separated by a layer of fog.</p>
<p>After a while, they (even the dogs) stopped on the Songhua River, and the mules and horses let out a few muffled long neighs. After that, the armed soldiers vigorously jumped onto the car, opened the car door, and dragged down many young people. They: were naked to the waist, blindfolded, gagged, their hands tied behind their backs, and their feet shackled. They staggered and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The armed soldiers swept away the snow on the ice, and then used iron shovels to dig holes in the hard ice—the roar of the Songhua River rushed out from below. In this sound, the sharp short knives of the armed soldiers slashed at the heads and shoulders of the bound young people, or pierced into their chests and wherever else... The young people bled, they couldn't shout, they couldn't fight, they just trembled painfully and stomped their feet hard.... Then they were thrown into the previously opened hole on the ice and disappeared into the Songhua River. The river water jumped out angrily...</p>
<p>Plop! Plop... The young people were thrown into the arms of the Songhua River with bloody wounds!</p>
<p>As if afraid that the river water would rush out of the hole, the cold froze the hole again, the snow suppressed the blood of the young people, and everything returned to its original shape not long ago, as if nothing had happened....</p>
<p>This, only the Songhua River understands! It embraces, kisses the stiff bodies of the young people with knife wounds with cold lips.</p>
<p>The sharp wind mixed with snowflakes and ice chips blown from Siberia angrily roared across this lonely night's wilderness, forest, and sparse villages...</p>
<p>The earth is gradually tending to be clear!</p>
