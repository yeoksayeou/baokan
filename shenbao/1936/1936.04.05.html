<h3>讀廿四年度中國銀入場報吿</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>望中行早日完成其國際匯兌銀行之使命</p>
<p>自各國從事於貨幣戰我中國所受之影響至前去兩年漸入於嚴重之程度工商失敗農村破產金融業亦風浪迭作危急萬狀狂瀾所趨幾難自救中國銀行在此驚濤駭浪之中四出維持應付裕如市塲得無分崩之虞而共廿四年全年營業之結果亦多進步六月一日添設儲蓄部以來半年之中存欵至四千三百餘萬元鈔票發行額增加八千餘萬元總額計二萬八千六百二十四萬元設非信用堅强曷能得此優良之成績耶</p>
<p>中行自政府為鞏固銀行制度計增加官股後已將資本自二千五百萬元增至四千萬元營業方針亦經確定『特別注重於對外貿易之調劑及年來所後事國際匯兌銀行之業務』質言之卽欲完成其國際匯兌銀行之任務是也去年改革幣制其用意亦不外乎是關於此點據中行報吿書云『我國幣値能恢復至民國廿三年以前五年內之平均價格物價從而回漲益以出口貿易之激增足以改善國際收支之途徑是殊有厚望焉』茲請就對外貿易與國際收支一檢討之</p>
<p>今年一月分我國對外貿易一度發見六十年來未有之出超然終如曇花一現而二月分仍為入趨此中盈虛消息姑不論卽就中行所估計之國際收支平衡表以觀進口貨之由報關入口者九一九·二百萬元私運入口者二一零百萬元（今年華南北走私在盛恐尙不止此數）合計一，一二九·二百萬元出口貨値之報關出口者五七五·八百萬元貨値估低之數（按百分之十五計）八六·四百萬元合計六六二·二百萬元進出兩除入超當在四六七百萬元遠過於關册所載之三四三百萬元加以我國出口貨大都非工藝品而為動植礦之原料品礦產開發無多動植俱為農家之作物以言中國之農多數為小農力旣薄弱地亦畸零非有澈底之改革整理殊無大量生產之望故欲有大宗輸出爭勝海外自非易事此其一農業生產亦需相當之資本在農村破產之後農民資本何自來卽使有銀行貸放又如何方能實際入於農民之手中行年來對於農業頗能積極放欵去年年終餘額二千五百十六萬元比前年增加百分之一九·九八但其中貸與小農者祇五十一萬元僅得百分之二又對於農村合作社放欵計四百四十九萬元亦比前年增加一倍以上然得借之合作社數（二，八一四社）與全國登記之合作社數（二六，二二四社）相比較亦祇十分之一有奇農民得資不易如是其結果非仍出於高利貸卽無增殖改良其出產之望此其二出口貿易之發展旣有待於各方之共同努力進口貨物雖因國人購買無力數量見戒但仍不絕而來如是而謀國際收支之平衡自屬艱辛設因收支失其平衡匯率隨之變動則對外貿易又不免受其影響矣此共三</p>
<p>國際收支卽無改響希望而因銀價未有劇變時局得免紛擾之故外匯仍能維持於不敝實吾人之所望者以言外匯當幣制改革之初三行設置三千二百五十萬美金之外幣準備（卽以白銀五千萬盎斯每盎斯美幣六角五分折算）「而得穩定外匯於新貨幣政策施行時之標準匯率」現在對外匯率以法幣一元對英一先令二便士半為標準此後有無變遷自為吾人最所關心之問題此在中行報吿書亦予論及據云「政府本無意將國幣比照任何外國法幣確定匯率不過此事權衡處置日後或屬不免因目前主要外國貨幣比較穩定此項問題在理論上頗屬重要也」</p>
<p>抑尤有進者我國欲謀海外貿易之發展金融機構航運事業亦當兼籌並顧荷屬東印度本為我華僑經營成功者因無銀行航業之設備坐令大好市塲為他人所侵奪中行旣欲完成其國際匯兌銀行之使命且已於倫敦設經理處大阪設分行又將在新加坡設立分行紐約設置經理處深望此後對于海外金融機關逐漸擴充更謀普及以利我國對外貿易之發展</p>
<p>雖然工商業未見振興則對外貿易之發展自亦難言年來工商業之失敗為因固多而一般金融業視放欵於工商業為畏途亦為其致命之傷但中行對於工商放欵去年俱有增加普通商業放欵增百分之十七工業放欵增百分之一〇·八八交通事業放欵增百分之一八·二四其報吿書並云「銀行應指導工廠企業俾其組織趨於健全更助長其發展原屬責無旁貸惜乎迄今至多僅畀以短期放欵而已」此誠不易之論其他各銀行設俱以中行之用心為心則工商業之復興庶可期矣</p>

<h3>十三國委員會　意國派員出席　主席將報和議經過</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院十三國委員會主席瑪達里亞伽、日前曾邀請意國政府與該委員會直接洽商意阿兩國議和問題、當由意國政府覆函照辦、謂十三國委員會在耶穌復活節後四月二十日左右開會之際、意國政府準備派遣代表出席云云、國聯會意國代表團常務秘書史高伯、頃以此函副稿、錄送國聯會秘書長愛文諾備案、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院十三國委員會、定於本月八日開會、聆取主席瑪達里亞伽、與意阿兩國代表接洽議和經過之報吿、據本社訪員所知下、其內容不外開兩點、　卽說明自接受委託與意阿兩國接洽以來、所獲得之唯一成就、厥為意國政府已允在復活節後、派員出席該委員會、　卽瑪氏曾向意國政府、詢問該國軍隊在阿國使用毒瓦斯情形、意國迄未答復、此外、十三國委員會除聽取瑪氏報吿之外、並當决定此後所當採取之態度、至國聯會大會十八國委員會、卽討論對意制裁問題者、此後究應採何項態度、十三國委員會亦當加以考慮（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會大會所屬十八國小組委員會、係以討論對意制裁事宜為專職、該委員會主席華斯貢賽洛斯（葡萄牙代表）頃通知國聯會秘書長愛文諾、謂行政院十三國委員會主席瑪達里亞伽、現方努力斡旋、以期促成意阿和議、故十八國小組委員會、此際不擬召集開會云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）艾登外相曾於本日午後延見意國大使格蘭第、有所商談、格蘭第又曾與外務决官在西泰、舉行談話、據一般人所知、意國大使係向艾登與汪西泰切實聲明、意軍佔領阿比西尼亞國査那湖區域之後、對於英國在該處所有利益、决不有所妨礙云、艾登外相午後又曾延見羅馬尼亞外交部長蒂杜樓斯哥（三日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>羅卡諾會議　英國主張緩開　法國要求受挫</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外相艾登已拒絕法國所提出羅卡諾公約簽字國卽英法意比四國星期三日在巴黎或比京舉行會議之建議、蓋以羅卡諾公約簽字國之會議、與定期星期三日在日內瓦舉行之十三國委員會會議同時開會、殊不相宜、且非必要也、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）政界人士頃宣稱、國聯會行政院十三國委員會、業已定於本月八日、在日內瓦開會、討論意阿兩國議和問題、屆時法國外長佛蘭亭、比國內閣總理齊蘭、英國外相艾登、自可乘便討論德國備忘錄、及其所可發生之後果、原可不必召集羅卡諾第二次會議、外務部業以此意通知法比兩國政府、此在一般人、則以為關係各國、對於羅卡諾第二决會議之日期與地點、正在賡續會商中云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於法國所提羅卡諾第二次會議、當於本月八日在比京開會一層、此間政界人士均加以好評、以為法國政府屆時必可提出「國聯會範圍以內之建設性質方案」、至法國對於德國廢約案原來所持持態度、乃係依照「羅卡諾公約所規定之程序」行事、而不必經由國聯會、因而各方不無疵議之處、茲法國旣已提出新方案、此種非議、自己不復存在、而英法兩國對於今後所當採取之程序、亦已歸於一致矣云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間各界人士之注意、現皆集中於羅卡諾公約簽字國會議之召集、依照法政府之建議、此項會談、至遲當於下星期內於巴黎或比京舉行、外長佛蘭亭或將卽於此會中、發表極重要之演說、詳細分析、幷評述德政府所提之各項和平計劃、或竟提出相當對案、亦未可知、此項對案、若果提出、則衆信其必將具調和三月十一日羅卡諾公約國之要求及德政府現所提出之和平計劃之性質云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）頃由可靠方面探悉、法國所提於下星期內召開羅卡諾公約國會議之建議、意政府對之、似不致有反對之傾向、綠日來關於此項問題之談判、已早在進行之中矣、（三日國民電）</p>
<h3>倫敦人士觀察　歐局暫吿平靜　波蘭要求解釋</h3>
<p>（倫敦）政界豫料星期杪可望安靜無事、外相艾登今日在下院所發之保蹬、聲明英法比三國參謀部間之談話、並不增重英國之政治義務、衆意此言大足安定人心、首相包爾溫已赴奇克斯、惟艾登今晚仍留外交部、本日訪之者、有意大使格蘭第、聞格氏復向艾登保證意國願尊重英國在阿比西尼亞條約權利之整個全部云、同時據柏林路透訪員電稱、德政界不欲批評艾登之言論、消息靈通各界則對於當德國正將作一種新建設性姿勢以奠定和平時、而艾登堅主進行參謀部間之談話、均表示失望云、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙　華沙波蘭駐德大使李潑斯基業已奉令晋錫德國外交部長牛拉脫、當就德國備忘錄有所商談、據一般人相信、波蘭政府因德國和平計劃、對於西歐各國、頗為詳盡、而於東歐各國、略而不談、未免失之歧視、乃令駐德大使向德國政府要求有所說明云、此際波蘭負責方面、對於德國備忘錄、尙未表明態度、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）法國擬將德國和平計劃、提交國聯會行政院審核、如或提出對案、亦擬一併交由行政院加以研究、頃據可靠消息、艾登外相昨日與法國大使戈爾平、比國大使馬希安會談之後、業已贊成法國此項辦法、英京消息靈通人士、以以為德國和平計劃、匪特羅卡諾公約各簽字國有關、抑且牽涉國聯會其他歐洲各會員國、自以交由行政院討論為宜、較之僅由羅卡諾公的各簽字國繼續談話、實允為愈也、此在外務部人士亦謂、法國若能率先將歐洲和平建設計劃、全部移至國聯會範圍內處理、則英國與論、必一致爲之後盾、不但英國政府之職責、可以爲之减輕、卽德國宣傳運動、對於英國與論之影之影響、亦可從此終止、且德國和平計劃、經國聯會參預之後則所擬訂立之互不侵犯公約、卽可按照集體安全制度、而成爲互助協定、實有百利而無一弊也、（三日哈瓦——斯電）</p>

<h3>法西主義的社會基礎（上）</h3>
<p>— Joseph　Barnes作　不忍譯</p>
<p>法西主義，正和它所熱烈頌揚的凱撒相同，是一個古雅的名詞。它不但是形容詞，還是讚美詞。當意大利人恢復古式寬袍與發掘羅馬街道的時候，他們要再找一個偉大的過去光榮的回響，便採用了這拉丁語。當工團主義者與國家主義者寫述法西主義的信條的時候，他們歪曲了它的字義。語言上還帶些非亞里安的異端氣味的德國國家社會主義者，則以另外一個意義看待它。和法西主義者相同，馬克思主義者也對它下着各種各樣的定義。甚至那些既非法西主義者又非馬克思義者的學者們，也誤認着，曲解着這名詞的意義。</p>
<p>法西主義的現象也和這術語一般的混亂。意國德國和奧國自稱着法西斯蒂國家。巴爾幹半島上與沿波羅的海的若干小國，也常被稱法西斯蒂國家。在任何西方國家內，都存在着直認不諱的法西主義者羣或法西斯黨員。可是，隨着法西主義的擴展，這字義卻愈見僞隘了。當政爭活躍的時代，連簡單的文字也得在字義學上發生隨地而異的變化。當托洛斯基，羅斯福總統與日本的少年軍官都被稱爲法西主義者的時候，『法西主義』二詞是需要分析的。在這一詞被應用得和階級運動的社會基礎與歐洲國家不同的日本或中國有關以前，發見它的意義是什麼，乃是十分重要的。</p>
<p>在法西主義已得勢的意德奧三國間所表現的法西主義的共通點是法西主義對於現代資本主義的經濟問題的態度。法西主義的政治方法是各不相同的；在對於種族或宗教的態度上面，意國與德國毫不相同。固然，這兩國都具有強烈的國家主義，都爭求政治的與經濟的獨立。但近年來這也是非法西斯國家的一般情形。固然，這兩國都顯示着理論上對於自由民主政治的無可容忍；但也嚴密保守着選舉制度，甚至用以產生大多數擁護的統計的證據，雖然這制度的行使有時是非常奇異與滑稽的。</p>
<p>可是，在這兩國內經濟政策上面，我們可以看出一個顯著的類似點。反對組織勞働的分別利益而偏向於大資本利益的法律，是德意兩國所共有的特徵。在意國，強烈的工團主義的傳統幫助着產生社團國家的理論；在德國，法西主義同樣地要求着全國公民從發展民族觀念所得的利益的一致。具體地說，雖然方法略有不同，　索里尼與希特勒都已打破舊有的勞働組織，禁止罷工權，而且維持在他們國內存在着的財產關係。</p>
<p>在這經濟政策之下，兩國法西主義者公開拉着的政治的後盾也是相同的。在德國，在意國，以及在若干法西主義尚未得勢的國家，普選運動大都指向着中等階級。小資產階級與無產農民階級在政治上聯絡的國家，就是法西主義最成功的國家。尤其是，當法西主義開始爭權的時候，及在以後的某一時期，法西主義是把這些羣眾當作它的有力的擁護者的。</p>
<p>在這優惠獨占資本家階級的經濟政策，與向較低的中等階級要求擁護的舉動之間，究竟含有什麼關係？後者是否只是一種狡猾的煽惑的奸計，一種藉以鞏固有力的資本家羣的控制的政治策略？或者，法西主義的重要意義是否在代表與產業所有階級及無產階級判然不同的一個階級？歐洲法西斯勢力的鞏固與否，與它擴張到別洲去的可能與否，須看這幾個問題的回答。</p>
<p>在西方國家，中等階級和把持着金融壟斷着產業的少數產業家分離，並不是什麼新現象。事實上，西歐市民從對有土地的封建貴族的鬥爭，獲得了勝利，他們就不得不遇到這些新篡奪者的挑戰了。這幾乎一直是不平的鬥爭。自由的獨立的商人和職工所組成的商人公會打倒了在貿易市鎮主張着領地權的封建貴族。在西歐，某一短時期內，這些中等階級管理人便利用了擴張的商業邊界從地主的手里，奪取權力，建立政治的統制權，創造符合他們自己的想像的社會制度與文化制度。</p>
<p>可是，商人公會，以及它所產生的資產階級文化，都不能和有限公司的組織在平等的條件競爭。當產業革命使大規模託辣斯添增機械作用，易動性，及精密分工的可能性這些從來夢想不到的新勢力的時候，中等階級自由資本主義的命運就被判定了。</p>
<p>在一意義上，它尚未誕生就死了。在另一意義上，它還沒有死，一九三三年以前希特勒的演說或者任何西方國家的職業戶口調查可以證明：它的羣眾，即使在權力上不發達，至少在數量上是發達的。因爲不僅是由店主，商人和職工所組成的真正中等階級，還有農民的大部分，商業社會的雇員，以及所謂自由職業者，都是屬於它的範圍之內的。</p>

<p>交涉經過</p>
<p>英兵佔領景冒後、瀾滄縣第七區區長張鼎新、卽致函詰問英方、原函文云、英軍執事先生電鑒、頃據我區民衆報稱、月之二十一日、有英國武裝軍人二百餘名、鴃子三百餘　、開入我縣景冒地方駐紮、不知來作何事、懇祈轉詰等情前來、査國際間凡有軍事行動、事前須雙方訂的簽定、並照會我政府令行所屬遵照、始能入境、今我民衆未奉明令、貴軍卽壇自入境、肆無忌憚、姑不論有無侵略野心、其藐視我國國權、並違背國際公法、顯而易見、現我民衆憤貴國之無理、已一致團結、誓死抵抗、誠恐民衆誤會、發生意外、致失邦交、用特佈達、尙希貴軍査照見覆、是為至盼、專此卽請旅祉、大中華雲南省瀾滄縣第七區區長張鼎新謹啓、</p>

<p>中國委員梁宇峯（色同是春花）</p>
<p>佈吿可疑</p>
<p>瀾滄縣第七區區長與英方交涉後、英方寄來之佈吿、可疑之處甚多、英軍旣耍入我境內測量、事前何以不通知我政府、乃將其武力擅自入境、此其一、雙方所用關防、印色一樣、英方委員圖記與我方委員名章、均屬春花色、英方銜名年月列前、我方列後、而用關防則我方在上、英方在下、並未平列、似乎不合、雙方大員、諒不出此、此其二、旣名曰中英會勘滇緬南段界務委員會、其行文常用委員會關防、今不特無委員會關防、且併中立委員之銜名而略去、此其三、英方年份書為西歷一九三六年、我方書為中華民國二十五年、月份均書為正月而不書日、査公元少用正月字樣、此其四、不久以前、我方奉縣府令、中英委員及中立委員已由戶算而下、今該隊自稱測量繪圖之英軍、　從緬甸而來、此其五、英方文吿內所云土目伙頭等名目、我方廢去已久、現改用區鄉鎭閭隣長等名目、彼全不知我內政之組織、此其六、英方所來人員、我方委員及中立委員並未在內、如此重大問題、竟由英方片面測量繪圖、統其重兵入境、此其七、中英兩方所爭地段、係在瀾滄第二區之西、測量繪圖、當由第二區之西起、今則不然、其繪圖段伸入內地之孔明山、顯然不待會勘、我第二區所屬地面已入英緬、英方純以繪圖為侵略、此其八、英兵一抵景冒、卽作種種軍事工作、斷非從事測量行為而應有此、此其九、有此九點、可知英方之文告、係出於揑造、蓋欲借此以矇混我民衆也、</p>
<p>進兵步驟</p>
<p>憶過去有一籍貫不明之外界傳敎士、名永維禮者、在瀾滄一帶、大、大設「撒拉堂」、（卽傳敎堂）廣為傳敎、用盡種種方法、誘引我民衆入敎、更用英文字母、併成各民族土話、編纂成書、以敎導之、一般愚民、因而被其麻醉者不少、彼在瀾滄一帶經營凡三十年、「撒拉堂」廣設二百餘個之多、凡設有「撒拉堂」之地、幾乎自成一特別區域、一切皆操之於「撒拉堂」、不歸我管轄、其勢力之大、可以想見、民國十八年、經當地政府、訴之於國府外交部、請英方撤去、然其勢力已養成、並有永維禮之子楊海洛、繼其父仍在經營、以致造成現在英軍擅進之導錢、</p>

<h3>兒童節播音講詞</h3>
<p>— 蔡勁軍</p>
<p>親愛的同胞們小朋友、今天是一個極可紀念的兒童節日、全國的國民、都為我們國家未來的主人翁兒童們、舉行熱烈的慶祝、在國難嚴重的今日、尤其他覺得道個慶祝更有價值、勁軍承上海兒童年實施委員會、邀請播音演講、得到與全市的市民、以及活活潑潑的可愛的兒童們講話的機會、個人尤其感到非常的榮幸與快慰，我今天所講的題目、是「培養兒童、成功一個復興民族的戰鬥員、﹂因為我覺得這是目前一個很需要而適切於救亡圖存的間題、各位都知道兒童在國家民族所佔的地位、是很重要的、兒童是國家未來的主人翁、兒童是民族繼續存在與發展的新生命、人人都經過兒童的生活、現在赴戰傷殺敵的士兵、以及擘劃大計的大員、就是從前在幼稚園小學授、淤戲的活活潑潑的可愛的兒童們、換句話說、現在過着兒寬生活、亨着兒童幸福的、就是將來救國救民、複興民族的健兒、所以我們想挽救危亡、復興民族、必須培養為復興民族而奮鬥的戰鬥員、尤其是培養兒童成功一個為復興民旎而奮鬥的戰鬥員、同胞們、我們應當愛護我們國家未來的生人翁、親愛的小朋友、你們要接受主人翁的重任、担負救國救民復興民族的工作、然而兒童的生活、是天眞爛漫的、兒童的品性、是純潔無瑕的、兒童的知識、好像還未染上墨水的素紙一樣、又如流水－般、决之東流則東流、决之西流則西流、在這可善可惡時期、要引導他們走上光明正大的道路、培養他們成為一個複興民族戰鬥員、那麼、跟兒童的生活有密切關係的人們、就負着這個重大任務了、我覺得和兒童生活有密切關係的有三種人、第一是兒童的家長、第二是學校的敎師、第三是負着導師保姆責任的警察、現在分別說明如下、</p>
<p>兒童的摹倣性是很强的、他們的一切言行、都以接近袍們的成年人們為模範、我們常常見到父母好讀書的、他的兒子也好讀書、父母好賭博的、兒子也好賭博、父母道德高尚的、兄子也好講道德、父母嗜烟酒的、他的兒子也嗜烟酒、這是社會上告訴我們的事實、我們以古聖賢來說、孟子假如沒有他的母親擇鄰而處、一任他自己胡為、恐怕他不能繼承孔子的學晚、而成為一代的大儒、由此可知家長對於兒童的前途、是負着如伺重大的資任、</p>
<p>其次是學校敎師、當兒童脫離了父母而到學校去的時候、則與敎師接近的機會多、敎師的言行、兒童時時刻刻在摹倣的、敎師賢則學生也賢敎師為非作歹、助學生也會跟殤為非作歹、因為他們以為敎師所做的都是對的、敎師好比製造物品的模型、如果模型不良好、製造出來的物品是不會好的、因此可見學校敎師、對於兒童培養的影響之大了、」</p>
<p>冉其次是警察、各位也許懷疑我話吧、其實理由很簡單、我們革命領袖蔣委員長不是說過嗎、警察為民衆之導師、與訓育之保姆、這就是說社會的敎育、警察是負着大部份的責任的、社會－切的不良就是因為警察辦得不好、換句話說、社會一切的進步、就是因為警政措置的得宜、不僅如此、假州警察能夠好好的領導民衆、造成一個有禮守法的社會、則被這個社會環境所薰陶、兒童一之也是有禮守法的、警察對於兒童直接的影響、實在不亞於學校敎飾、我們不是常常見有許多小朋友，在街上舉着警察的見禮與操作嗎、又常常見到有許多兒童在學着警察逮捕盜匪的遊戲嗎、一個模節警察、可以使他們轄區域內的兒童、受他的保護舉訓導、而轉移他們的頑劣的風氣、與改良他們的惡習、總之、兒童的家長、學校的教師、以反負着導師與保姆責任的警察、都負着培養兒童的責任、家長是負着家庭教育的責任、教師是負着學校敎育的責任、警察是負落社會敎育的責任、所以培養兒童成功一個復與民族的戰鬥員、非前面所說的三種人、都負起責任來不可、可是我們來檢討一下、我們國家未來的主人翁、兒童有幾位是過着幸福的生活呢、享受完善的敎育呢、他們常常處在　　污穢的生活環境中、他們沒有人敎導、所以到了成年的時候、便成為不堪造就、變為墮落的青年了、這是何等的可惜、也是國家貧弱、民族衰落的一大原因、親愛的同胞們、你們會經環顧世界各國約情勢吧、你們也知道我們國家所處的國際環境吧、恐怖的戰雲、瀰漫了全世界、我們的民族垂危於千均一髪了、單是靠着成年的人門、去拯救這垂危的命運、是不能夠的、必須培養我們國家未來的生人翁、兒童成功一個健全的戰鬥員、鼓着熱血、荷着槍砲、不斷的繼續奮鬥、國難才可以解除、民族復興才有敎望、因此我敢站在國家與民族的立塲上、向全市的乃至於全國的兒童的家長、學校的歟師、以及負着導師保姆責任的警察、疾聲忠吿、第一須認清了我們國家目前的環境、與自己對於兒童所負的重大的貨任、第二要以復興民族為前提、一言一行、皆合乎新生活的準則、作兒童的模範、第三要時時誘發兒童求知的興趣、吏兒童智德體三育、日益增進、尤當將國家的民族的有激發性的故事、告訴他們、喚起他們愛護國家民族的觀念、務使全國的兒童、成功一個繼續為復興足族而奮鬥的戰鬥員、這樣今天的紀念、才有價值、親愛的小朋友、今天是你們的紀念日、你捫不要悠悠忽忽地過去了這千金－刻的寶貴的童年光陰、要記着你們是國家未來的主人翁、在你們小小的肩膊上、負荷着奏山般的重任、你們願意聽故事嗎、現在我來告訴幾個可以作兒童模範的故事你們聽、第一個是知禮的孔融、當他叫歲的時候、他的父競送幾個梨子給他、並且叫他分給他的哥哥們、結果他將大的都讓給哥哥們、自己取－個小的、他的父親間他為什麼不取一個較大的、他說我的年紀小、應當取小的、哥哥的年紀大、故應分給大的、這是多麼知禮的兒童啊、所以後來他能夠成名、我敎望你們也好像孔子一樣的知禮、第二個是擊甕救女的司馬光、他是做過朱朝的宰相的、當他做小孩的時候、與筆兒在庭下遊戲、有一個小孩失足跌人滿裝清水的甕中、羣兒手足無措、恐怕禍及自己、爭相奔避、司馬光則義激於中、智默生於心、乃拾石將甕擊破、救出九死一生的小朋友、道是何等義俠的事情、你們有這樣的義氣嗎、第三個是安貧守分的梁鴻、他是東漢時人、當他在兒童的時侯、家裹窮得很、連做飯的火都發生問題、因此他的鄰人很可憐他、叫梁鴻把鍋移到他家的灶上去做飯、在那位鄰人以為梁鴻一定是歡喜到了不得的、誰知梁鴻很和氣的拒絕他、梁鴻說、我不能無報酬而用你的火、小朋友、梁鴻能夠安貧守分、而不享受非分的東西、這是何等廉潔的行為、你們都應該效法他、不是自己的束西、絕對不要苟取絲毫、第四是捨身湔雪國恥的汪琦、汪琦是春秋時代魯國的童子、魯哀公時代、齊國伐魯、汪琦大憤、恥國難之不報、因此捨身救國、仗劍殺賊、卒至為國犧牲、他雖然是死了、可是他的名字永遠的留在國人的腦海中、你說多麼光榮、親愛的小朋友、你們也知道國恥嗎、你們也知道國難嗎、請鼓起你們沸騰的熱血、以注琦為模範吧、親愛的小朋友、在國家多難的今日、你們不要辜負全國人民對於你們的希望、第一要受你們的家長敎師以及警察的訓導、第二要努力求學增進你們知能第三要有愛擭國家民族的思想、第四要實行新生活、第五要健强你們的身體、好像孔融與司馬光一樣的明禮義、又如梁鴻與汪琦一樣的知廉恥、養成一個健全的復興民旗的戰鬥員、這是我今天所期望於你們的、並祝你們的幸福無量、</p>

<p>市長致詞　主席吳市長致詞略謂、各位小朋沙、今天是兄童節、我們大家在此慶祝、無任快慰、國民政府之所以要定今年為兒童年、為的是要擴大和普遍兒童節的宜傳，因為今日之兒童即未來的主人翁、要擔負將來國家的重任、其地位十分重要、所以我們不能不喚起全國人民、全國父母和整個社會來注意兒童的問題、兒童問題之最要者、第一是敎養、第二是健康、第三是思想、我們的政府社會和父母、應該拿兒童問題當作復興民族的最切要的工作、在從前為父母者以兒童為一家所私有、對於兒童的敎義健康思想等問題、以及兒童與社會國家民族之關係一槪不問、完全以個人的喜怒愛憎及個人的方法來敎養兒童、其是否與民族有利或有害亦一概不管、我們處在今日世界，道種觀念就要根本去掉、兒童不是一家一姓所私有、兒童問題是國家社會的問顯、今日才為父母者就要為國家富强、民族複興、社會幸福來謀兒童之敎餐體格之鍛鍊與思想之啟發、從前關於兒童的問題很少人注意、因為從前對於國家民族之興衰、認為很少數人的事情、而不是全體民衆的事情、所以國家有時盛有時衰、中國幾千年歷史中可以看得小國家盛衰的原因、凡得其人則盛、不得其人則衰、固然得人不得人是很有關係、但我們不能將此責任交給心數人、要一方面國家得人而治、同時國民人人能負責、則國家就會興盛、要國民人人能直接問接負資、必須具備各種條件、看古什中外歷史、有很多國家亡了亦能復興、也有亡了不能復興、其原囚全在該民族之能否具備建立國家的條件為轉移、大戰後之德國、到今日能在世界上吐氣揚眉、變成强國、即此一例、中國有四千年歷史、四萬五千萬人民、地廣物博、到今日一天天衰弱、雖倖未滅、但前途很危險、救國家非一朝一夕少數人的簡單工作、是要靠長期奮鬥全體不斷的努力、才能一代代相績不斷的負建立國家的責任、兒童問題是民族中心問題、所以兒童節要擴大宣傳、使整個社會來注意、兒童年兒童節的意義即在此、今大來參加典禮的兒童多數都是有幸福有機會受敎育的兒童、我們不要忘掉社會裹許多無機會受敎育和無父母的兒童、尤其不要忘掉殘廢的兒童、上海虹橋有一個盲童學校、是使殘廢的兒童受智識、在今天有募捐運動、要喚起上海市民不特注意兒童問題、同時要幫助殘廢的兒童云、</p>
<p>黨政致詞　市黨部代表邢琬致詞、略調　希望各位兒童和樹木一樣能向各方面發展、傲房屋的楝樑、做鐵道的枕木、　希望各位要有健全的身體、才有健全的精神、做偉大的事業、　國家有事時、全國總動員、兒童也要發揮其能力云、旋由潘局長簡單致詞、恭祝小朋友健康、</p>

<h3>中國銀行民國二十四年度營業報告　中國銀行董事長宋子文先生致股東大會報告書</h3>
<p>幣制與金融</p>
<p>民目二十年秋，雯個，印度，日本相繼　　金本位，二十二年美幣復隨之貶值，　致我　幣值激漲，遠二十三年夏，美又勵行購銀政策，銀價益高，　我國國際收支，久處逆境，而外匯匯率，反繼續上嚴，因而通貨緊縮，試觀民國二十年至二十三年間，上海物價指數自一二九·二跌至九九，即可以　見其影　之大　。</p>
<p>民國二十三年以來，大量白銀，　出國外，銀行　銀　减，不特物價釜跌，且有　　金融恐慌之趨勢，政府乃於是年十月中旬，宣布徵牧百分之十白銀出口稅及平衡稅，以謀補救，自是雖在國內仍維待銀本位，而外匯則巳與國外銀價脫離其固有關係，用致外匯匯率，自尋其漲落之途徑，第當變動頻劇之時，政府常謀穩定之方，亦不無收效。</p>
<p>政府採用徵收白銀出口稅及平衡稅之策，明係暫時權宜處置，藉應目前之急需，俾得從長計議根本解决方法，自實行後，一時物價雖未下跌，但政府終認為問題嚴重：深慮外匯匯率高漲，則難免阻撓出口貿易，而致國內通貨緊縮，有增無巳；反之，如外匯匯率下降，則匯率與國外銀價益相懸殊，大量偷運，勢必隨之而起；况當時紙幣尙在兌現制度之下，設因偷運，减少存銀，動搖信用，勢必釀成提存擠兌，影響全國金融，為害匪淺。</p>
<p>達二十四年世界銀價繼續上漲，金融恐慌益甚，是年初，政府雖賴平衡稅之昇降，以平衡國幣銀値之漲落，惟稅率上下不定，人心不安，當局乃進而更與中外銀行締結「紳士恊定」，相約不再運銀出口，第其時存銀之數量已大减，加以國幣銀値，遠超出外匯匯價之上，窖藏偷運之風復盛，現銀遂益就枯竭。</p>
<p>其時因國幣銀値，遠超出外匯匯價之上，市塲遂懸擬政府將效法外國低貶幣値，雖政府一再宜佈决不採用低貶幣値，或其他類似之策，以事救濟，但人心惶惑，依然如故，外匯匯率與國外銀價間之平價差額，及近期與遠期匯率之差數，仍增進不巳，均足以表示幣制前途之荊棘，方興未艾，就下表所列上海外匯匯率與倫敦銀價之平價差額，即可以表現其梗　。</p>
<p>通貨緊縮，銀價枯窘，以致即期匯率堅挺，一般民衆，膽顧幣制前途，咸懷疑慮，遂使遠期匯率益疲，其間差額，有時竟達年息三分，利潤旣厚，原供商業運用之資金，競趨外匯套息，於是拆息益高，百業蒙其影響，籲請救濟之聲，時有所聞，加以信用緊縮，地產呆滯，短期押欵，無力淸償，昔日所認為優良穗妥之担保品，今則視為可畏之物，同時滬市股票，繼續跌落，交易冷淡，各金融業無不多方企圖維持，但亦祇能為自身謀靈活而已，因而巿况日趨疲敝，恐慌之來，儼在目前。</p>
<p>處此危急之際，政府乃於二十四年三月末，增加中交兩行官股，俾中央，中國，交通三行，相互關聯，趨於一致，以期易收統制之效，結果頗著成績，至夏間，數小銀行發生周轉不靈，經政府假手三行之協助，卒免風潮擴大，但信用動搖之在潮，迄未寗息，未幾，多數錢莊，又相率告急，限制每戶提存九百元，政府復設立錢業監理委員會，審查五十五家匯劃錢莊資產，而估其價値，以為撥給政府公債而資救濟之標準，俾其獲以政府公債向主要銀行押欵，以資周轉焉。</p>
<p>溯自東北淪失，北部邊境，關防久弛，有組織之私運，肆行無阻，且麕集平津各地兌現，並向民間以紙幣升水百分之十乃至十五，以吸收現洋，未匝月，中國銀行一家，兌出現洋巳達千萬之巨額，卒賴當地銀行公會商會之合作，與夫民衆之擁護，對於兌現，獲嚴加限制，自是華北紙幣，實際已立於不兌現之地位，而華北與國內外各埠之交易，持券人雖不能兌取現洋支付，但由銀行給以國內外各埠匯撥之便利，各項交易，仍舊照常無礙，此種趨勢，實足以打破一般所謂華北民衆狃於重視硬幣之成見，並因此得一實證，要在政府能維持信用而調劑有方，民衆自無不樂於收受紙幣，决不至疑慮政府施行貨幣膨脹之策，以侵削其積蓄也。</p>
<p>旋英國因我國之建議，　有徵求美，日，法，意諸國派遣專家來華考察，藉籌恊助穩定幣制之舉，各國最初大都贊同，但最後僅英國聲明，决意派遣其有席經濟顧問李滋羅斯氏來華。</p>
<p>廿四年四月末，墨西哥為維護其國幣制，收回銀幣，同時美國購銀，亦略加限制，世界銀價，暫吿下跌，惟我國金融不安狀態，仍未稍殺，嗣以華北時局紛擾，形勢益惡，內債市塲，反響尤烈，其時通貨貶値之謠諑繁興，外匯與標金投機之風大熾，合法營業，損失不貲，偷運白銀，處罰雖嚴，但利之所在，人所必趨，私運之事，未嘗或戰。匯率即期與遠期相差之巨，劃頭升水之奇昂，銀根綦緊，昭然若著。且物價下落，信用緊縮，工商業益就衰敝，通貨膨脹之呼聲，忽又傳來。</p>
<p>遠八月，國外銀價，稍形穩定，市况亦略見好轉，第爲時無幾，幣制謠言復起，紛紛競購外滙，至十月中旬，外匯之投機益熾，至十一月二日，滙率復跌百分之十七，同時票金竟由九百漲至一千百六十元，投機與恐慌之風，瀰漫金融市塲，整個金融組織，爲之動搖，於是十一月四日，財政部乃有新貨幣政策之宣布。</p>
<p>當宣布政策之先，政府曾嚴望考慮，深信白銀國有，及採外匯本位，實爲惟一良策，其所以遲遲未發者，在冀能獲得巨額外債，以期减輕實行新貨幣政策之危機，適李滋羅斯氏於九月來我國，考察經濟狀况，而十月中外匯匯率，適又急降，勢難冉延，坐失時機，於是政府迺不得不毅然立即實施此新政策。</p>
<p>十一月三日政府公布法令之大要，規定以中央·中國·交通三行所發行之紙幣為法幣，凡持有銀本位幣，或其他銀幣生銀者，原定限三個月內兌換法幣，嗣復展至六個月，所有完糧納稅及一切公私債務，概准以法幣淸償；其關於發行準備金及保管事宜，則設立發行準備管理委員會管理之，該會係由財政部及金融界商界代表，共同組織：並爲使法幣按照其時價格長久穩定起見，乃令中央·中國·交通三行無限制買賣外匯；更為求貫澈此項政策之施行，並擬將中央銀行改組爲一超然中央準備銀行；至關於整理財政之計劃，亦準備就緒，國家預算，豫計於十八個月後，可臻平衡；此外並醫設不動產抵押銀行，復一面修改現行法令，以期地產易於作押，而增加商業銀行資金之流動性。</p>
<p>新貨幣政策之施行，有人深表驚異，蓋始終以為國人狃於重視硬幣之舊習，此新政策未必能見諸實行，乃不期十一月四日實行以後，三日之內，即吿成功，惟華北存銀，則另設準　委員分會保管之，至廣東廣西則不獨另設準備委員會、並仍以其向來　行該　省之事洋爲本位，除爾廣外，法幣成統一　行各地，再各至要物品，　　而因此發生投機，一度猛漲，然旋即平復。</p>
<p>此斬貨幣政策之　功，厥因甚多，董當改革以前，貨幣具金敵狀况，，至為混亂，在此恐行家明　此事，並非創舉；且民國廿三年十月十五日以後，實際上已禁止現銀之外　，而　北五閱月中，出於民衆之愛國自動，相戒不兌現，巳漸使事北民衆恬然習於不兌換之紙幣；益以外商銀行之合作，允以英國大使之通令，裨助良多，吾則多數外僑及外國機關，或藉治外法　爲護符，從事阻撓，則實行之際，必增加困難與淆雜；最後美國政府，復按每盎斯美幣六角五分，購我白銀五千高盎斯，使政府銀行護有充分外幣準備，而得穩定外匯於新貨幣政策施行時之標準匯率。</p>
<p>新貨幣政策施行以來，巳五閱月於茲，銀價雖自每盎斯二十九又十六分之五便士，跌至二十便士左右，不但國外匯兌，非常穩定，而國內匯兌，除兩廣雲南外，每千元隔省僅收手續費一元，省內則五角，且政府本無意將國幣比照任何外國法幣，確定匯率，不過此等權衡今茲外滙滙率，旣循正當標準，長久穩定，因之出口增而進口减，據海關報吿，可以窺知，是為六十年來未有之現象，由此而信用逐漸恢復，銀根鬆動，商工業亦遂見活躍矣。</p>
<p>儻外匯滙率，能長此安定，而東亞時局，復漸趨和緩，則兩年來逃避國外之資金，自可令其重返故土，若世界經濟益增起色，則我國或更能吸引外資之重來也。</p>
<p>新貨幣政策之成就如何，或以為為時尙早，未可斷言，睹如銀價之狂跌，對外時局之紛擾，預算之不平衡，均為其　結所在，僅銀價竟跌至理論上平價十七又四分之三便士時，白銀輸入我國，良有利可圖，設政府未將大量存銀，及時出售，則他日外匯匯率，或不免難於維持，然純銀與純金之比價，巳達歷來最低之價格，似可無庸如此顧慮；或更以遠東時局，倘有紛擾，勢必影響幣制為慮者，然無論任何國家遭遇非常困難，任採何種幣制，終難免不蒙影響，惟我國幣値，能恢復至民國廿三年以前五年內之平均價格，物價從而回漲，益以出口貿易之激增，足以改善國際收支之途境，是殊有厚望焉。然當此銀價之時有漲落，及其對於國內經濟之紛擾，設非多數國家認為白銀在幣制上尙有使用價值，則考慮銀本位之恢復，要屬極大錯誤，政府果能將新幣制成立時所採之步驟，切實施行，舉如預算之平衡，中央準備銀行之剏設，則健全貨幣制度之早臻完善，計日可期，而國民經濟之改造，　利賴之。</p>
<p>去年我國金融界所處地位，頗形杌陧，各金融機關，一方旣須負責因應巿面之難關，他方復須切實推行政府所决採之貨幣政策，任重力艱，時虞隕越，然不特本國主要銀行舉措一致，即外商銀行，亦多畀以誠擎合作，殊堪殷慰，今後銀行間之密切合作，當益感重要，過去一年間之經騐，安知非來日光明之徵兆歟。</p>
<p>銀行業務</p>
<p>本行之新局面去歲我國金融市場之緊張情形及其不安之狀，已略述如前。因自動伸縮之銀本位幣制，已失其效用，而謀幣制金融之進展，則視　昔更有賴於銀行之合作，如何設法俾國內主要銀行之業務有密切聯絡，洵屬急不容緩之務。蓋政府久巳主張，以特殊職務授予有政府股本之三行，同時並釐定共相互合作之方，以期確建其執行之共同金融政策，而謀銀行制度之鞏固逮去歲三月方見諸實行焉。政府增加本行股本，俾本行股本自二千五百萬元增至四千萬元，本行官股遂佔全體股份之半數。董事則自十五人增為二十一人，其中九人規定由政府指派，監察人亦自五人增為七人，規定其中三人由政府指派。本人旋被任為本行董事長，常務董事宋漢章先生服務本行有年，經騐宏富，被仟為本行總經理，以代張嘉璈光生，張嘉璈先生則改任中央銀行副總裁。同時中央，交通兩行亦有變更，結果將使本行特別注重於對外貿易之調劑，及年來所從事國際匯兌銀行之業務焉。</p>
<p>業務工作過去一年中，本行雖處於金融異常劇變狀况之下，負責綦重，然尙有數種業務之進展，堪以舉吿者：</p>
<p>（一）兌換券之流通本行歷來在發行銀行中向居重要，深得社會信仰，去歲十一月政府施行新幣制政策，賦予本行兌換券以法幣之資格焉。本行去歲增加發行八千餘萬元，固由於政府睿斷採用白銀國有之策而來，但同時亦可表示本行在我國金融組織所居之地位。</p>
<p>（二）增設海外機關自民國十七年政府特許本行為國際滙兌銀行以來，遂力事助長對外貿易之發展，及盡意海外僑胞之扶持，除在國外各重要商業中心地委托同業代理外，並設經理處於倫教，設分行於大阪，近復感覺在海外增設機關之時已至，因覩英屬海峽殖民地及南洋羣島僑胞之衆，及錫與橡膠業之欣欣向榮，巳定在新加坡設置分行。並將即在紐約設置經理處，以增進中美間之貿易及滙兌便利，兼得盡力於政府新幣制之施行，預計數月後即可成立。</p>
<p>（三）設立儲蓄部去歲五月遵儲蓄銀行法之規定，並呈奉財政部核准，設立儲蓄部。雖該部分支即附設於本行各分支行處，但另撥資本五百萬元，並採用獨立會計。儲蓄總部六月一日在滬開業，其分支旋即成立於本行各分支行處。</p>
<p>（四）浙贛鐵路之建築本行曾聯合本國銀行數家共同投資於浙贛鐵路之杭州至蘭溪，金華至玉山，及玉山至南昌各段之建築。本年玉山至南昌一段雖巳竣工，然為謀該路與粵漢鐵路之聯絡，以便扶植東南各省之經濟發展，實有完成南昌至萍鄉一段之必耍。因此本行去歲再受鐵道部之囑託，與各銀行及德國奧脫華爾夫公司磋商，協助該路之延長。在與建築玉山至南昌一段同樣條件之下，銀行團允再借國幣一千萬元，德國公司允供給値國幣一千萬元之材料，以俾完成南昌至萍鄕一段。德國公司更承諾以我國物產償還其墊借材料欵項之一部份，用裨助我國之出口貿易。與此事有關係之銀行，除本行外，為交通·中國農民·金城·新華·裕民等行及中國建設銀公司暨郵政滙業儲金局。</p>
<p>（五）擴充農業放欵本行去歲仍繼續協濟農業之產銷。年終農業放欵餘額達二千五百十六萬一千元，就中貸與小農者計五十一萬元。全年貸與農村合作社之欵的四百四十九萬　，超出廿三年一倍以上，年終餘額尙有一百叫十四萬元。放欵區域達九省八十縣，內計廿六處合作社聯合會，二千八百十四處合作社，十二萬六千餘家農民。</p>
<p>資產負債情形</p>
<p>（甲）存欵</p>
<p>（一）存欵總額去歲年終存欵總額達七六六·二九一·六二八·二五元，較廿三年增加一二九·五九七·七二五·六六元。內計：　活期存欵二四〇·四〇五·九五五·〇二元，較上年增加五七·五四九·九一七·八三　；定期存欵三二三·　〇五九·四四四·三七兀，比上年增加七一·一七五·一一〇·七九元：　同業存欵二〇二·八二六·二三八·八六元，視上年增加九〇·八七二·六八九七·〇四元。此存欵之劇增，大都由於去歲金融情况非常變動之所致。此等現象大半由於人心之不安，及由於同業欲以所增存之欵（增加九千餘萬元，見前）為其活動之資源，本行自不能照常盡量運用。</p>
<p>（二）存疑戶數　去　存戶計一九九·四〇四戶，　　　　加二元九·二〇四戶·</p>
<p>（三）存疑性質　去　與上年存疑性質區別之比例百分率如下</p>
<p>（乙）放欵</p>
<p>（一）織細楓　　去歲年終放疑總　計四八九·〇七一·一〇四·三四元，視上年增加七七·一一八·九二九·三三元。內計：　短期放疑及透支二三六·八二四·三七九·五九元，增加五二·六三六·九四四·一〇元；　定期放疑二〇七·〇四六·三八九·一七元，增加丸·二八五·二七二·四〇元；　貼現及購推期票計四五·二〇〇·三三五·五八元，增加一五·一九六·七一二·八三元。</p>
<p>短期放疑與透支較上年增加百分之二八·五七，定期放欵增加百分之四·六九，貼現與購進期票增加百分之五〇·六五。因無中央貼現銀行，及銀行同業之大部份　動準備均　集於本行，本行如求對於其他金融機關克盡厥責，自必須常年保有多數之流動資金。　以新幣制施行以前數月中，屢有資本逃避之現象，本行為避免外滙蒙不當高壓之風臉，自覺助長銀根鬆動之策，實未敢採也。</p>
<p>（二）放欵性質去歲放欵就其借欵之目的區分比較廿三年增加如下：普通商業放疑增加百分之一七·，〇〇，業放欵增加百分之一〇·八八，交通事業放欵增加百分之一八·二四，農業放欵增加百分之一九·九八。</p>

<p>（己）有價證券去年終本行投資有價證券總額共一〇三、二四六，七八〇·八九元，內計充發行之保證準備者六九、四一四、八八六·五六元，屬於營業投資者三三、八三一、八九四·三三元佔本行全體資產百分之七·七〇，較廿三年總額八六、九八一、五九九·〇六元，增加一六、二六五、一八一·八三元。</p>
<p>損益</p>
<p>（一）各項開支去歲本行全體開支共七百廿四萬九千餘元。較廿三年增加五十八萬三千餘元。其增加主由業務之擴充及機關之添設，但尙有大部係一時支出無繼續性者。</p>
<p>（二）盈餘分配　廿四年純益計三百六十萬二千三百五十七元九角八分。除遵章提公積金百分之十，計三十六萬二百三十五元七角九分外，所餘三百廿四萬二千一百二十二元一角九分，加入上年滾存一萬六千六百七十一元五角九分，共計三百二十五萬八千七百九十三元七角八分，除攤派官商股正息二百二十三萬九千七百二十六元零三分外，餘一百零一萬九千零六十七元七角五分，歸入盈餘滾存。</p>
<p>儲蓄部業務概况</p>
<p>（一）存欵去年終儲蓄存欵總額共四三、一四〇、〇二七·九一元，內中：活期儲蓄存欵計二二、〇一一、四六四·五五元，定期儲蓄存欵計二一、一二八、五六三·三六元。存欵戶數共七五、八六四戶，內中：活期存戶五〇、七三八戶，定期存戶二五、一二六戶。</p>
<p>（二）放欵　廿四年終放欺總額共三一、〇一四、四五一·五四元。就中短期放欵計四、八五七、七一一·九一元，佔全體放欵百分之一五·七〇；定期放欵計一五、七六一、五九二·九一元，占百分之五〇·八〇；投資有價證券計八、〇五六、八四七·七〇元，佔百分之二六·〇〇；存放同業計三四七、一九四·一七元，佔百分之一·一〇；內部往來計一、九九一、一〇四·八五元，佔百分之六·四〇。</p>
<p>（三）損益　全體開支共十萬零八千七百十七元叫角六分。將上數及付出利息與收入利息及其他收入相抵後，尙餘純益九寓七千七百十一元八角二分，歸入提存準備。</p>
<p>對外貿易</p>
<p>據海關報吿，廿四年進出口貿易總額十四億九千五百零萬元，其中純進口額計九萬一千九百二十一萬一千元，純出口額計五萬七千五百八十萬九千元，入超計三萬四千三百四十萬二千元。茲將最近三年來進出口價額比較如下：（單位百萬元）</p>
<p>由上表觀察，近三年來我國對外貿易之漸入順境，主由進口貨値總額之繼續减少，至出口則比較無變動。我國對外貿易之平衡，表面雖見改善，但應注意者海關所發表數字，未遽可視為正確，蓋自近年增加進口稅率以來、私運　形　起，過去一年中之時局糾紛，更令海關對於數重要商埠失其控制之效也。至私運進口數額，雖未能確實估定，然為數當不在少。</p>
<p>就下列近三年來逐月對外貿易總値觀之，進口恒隨季節變動，而出口則長年平均，去歲逐月貿易總値亦與上年無異也。</p>
<p>上列海關報吿之貨值，其數字因各種原因，殊不足用爲表示我國對外貿易消長之根據。故就二十二年至二十四年海關報舍數字所示各種商品之量。以求進出口貨愛之指數。出口貨量之指數，係由佔二十二年出口總　百分之五六·四之十四種商品之量求得。至進口貨量之指數，乃由十三種商品之量，共佔二十二年進口總値百分之五五·七者求得。茲將上述貨量指數，並二十二年至二十四年對外貿易貨值指數分列於下：</p>
<p>二十二至二十四年我國對外貿易指數（係以二十二年値量之數作百分）</p>
<p>外　之漲幕與對外貿易之盛衰，恒爲國人所注意，然上列數字不能顯然表現邇來外　劇烈變爾之影響於我國對外貿易之程度，所可述者，去年出口貿易，直接受外匯之影響，允以年終盤甚，較二十二年及二十三年同期數字，均大有加增。</p>
<p>對外貿易之國別</p>
<p>十四年由美進口之總値大减，然美國仍居我國進。買易之首位。日本則以對我國出口增至一千二百七十萬七千元，仍列决席，德國則竟代英國，一躍而居第三位矣。</p>
<p>去歲我國對各國之出口貿易，其决序無大更動，仍以美國居第一位，對美輸出之貨値，計增四千一百九十七萬五千元，香港原為轉口之中心，乃由第一位退居第二位，决為日，英兩國。法，德均無變動，惟由我國輸入之貨値，則較往年大增。</p>
<p>由上表觀之，去年對我出口唯一劇增之國，日本則以鉅額鋼鐵，機器，魚類，海產及糖；德國則以鋼鐵，機器，車輛；法屬安南則以米，自二十三年之三千一百三十九萬三千元增至五千二百九十萬六千元；澳洲則以小麥，麵粉與木材，均無不比前增加。去年由美進口貨値，因棉花，小麥，烟草之劇跌，故較二十三年將近减少一萬萬元。英國因對我國所輸出棉布，機器之衰洛，亦减少二千六百四十一萬五千元。</p>
<p>去歲我國對美輸出之桐油，生絲，種籽，蛋類，對法輸出之生絲，花生，對德輸出之棉花·桐油·銻砂·均大有增加。對印度則减少一百八十一萬六千元，對英屬南洋一帶刖减少二百五十六萬二千元，對朝鮮則减少四百十二萬二千元。</p>
<p>對外貿易之埠別</p>
<p>二十三年與二十四年我國各主要口岸進出口貿易，其佔全國對外貿易總値之百分率，可於下表觀之，惟該項數宇，因各地政治糾紛未已，私運盛行，未能認為十分正確。</p>
<p>二十三年與二十四年進出口貿易之埠別</p>
<p>主要進出口商品</p>
<p>就我國去年進口之主要商品而言，米由上年之六千五百六十八萬五千元增至九千三百三十三萬三千元，由第三位一躍而居第一位；在二十三年首出之五余礦物，則减少二百九十萬元，退居第二位；機器及工具則自第四位，升至第三位，棉花自第二位，降居第四位。</p>
<p>去年我國出口商品，首推前年居第三位之　金礦物，桐油出口總値，則較前年增加一千五百三十六萬六千元，由第六位躍居第二位，生絲則自第七位升至第三位，蛋及蛋製品，仍居第四位，推茶葉因出口减少六百四十五萬七千元，竟自前年之第一位降至第五位，種籽則　加一千三百八十三萬六千元，乃自第九位升至第六位。</p>
<h3>國際收支平衡</h3>
<p>本行以往各年之報吿，對於估計我國國際收支之平衡，嘗述及搜集公示數字是以徵信之難，在過去一年中，欲求正確佔計，則較往年尤多窒礙。蓋緣時局多故，允以華北為甚，海關當局，有時行使職權，輒遇不能克制之困難。其結果巨量之·人造絲·捲烟紙·火柴及其他貨品等，竟得漏稅輸入，即在防止銀幣之漏出亦然。蓋銀幣所含銀値，遠逾其外滙之値，僥倖私運者獲利極厚也。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>下表所估計私這入口之貨物及私運出口之白銀，係由徵詢各方意見，及依據鄰邦發表之統計而得，但祇能視為近似而已。</p>
<p>民國二十四年度中國國際收支平衡（單位國幣百萬元）</p>
<p>華傑滙欵之估計，係根據向國內常有此項滙入之各地之調查而來，就去歲外滙之放長，與通貨局面之不穩視之，實遠逾所期，然可謂為參數華僑寄居之國，其商業均有起色故也。</p>
<p>去歲過半年中，通貨局面不穩定，多數資金逃避無疑，縱其中一部分自十一月初施行新幣制後，人心安定，重返故土，然全年外溢之數仍巨也。</p>
<p>此外因採用新幣制及其後在海外售出國外存銀一部分之自然結果，中·中·交三行所擁外幣，遂大見增加。然此資金移轉之總額，殊無法確定，故不得不括入「無法證明來源」項下，以資平衡焉。</p>
<p>在此一年中，我國國際收支平衡之估計，旣大為無徵考之白銀移動，及貨物之私運進口，與各項之不明貿易所左右，則錯誤之處，在所難免，但為明瞭我國金融經濟問題起見，上表所列數字，或不無參考之價値也</p>
<h3>農業槪况</h3>
<p>去歲國內雖不免間有水旱之災，但全國農民尙稱有年。農產之總收穫，縱不甚豐，但其價格則較前兩年略高，農民之總收入，較前兩年或高出十分之一。農產品之對外貿易，亦頗有利，農產品出口固减，但不如進口農產品减少之多，實際出口總値，竟超過進口總値，此歐戰以後，從未曾有之現象也。</p>
<p>農業生產之成本，因缺乏統計資料，難於估計；第就工資及肥料·種籽·農具等之價格觀之，一年來並無多大變動。而一方銀行貸欵合作社利率之低，與鄕村交通治安之進步，均有减低農業生產成本之趨勢。農村復與氣象，雖尙未覩，但不乏改善之迹。到處均見新築田舍及鄉村學校；人口之自鄕村移至城市，亦有反向之趨勢；多數農家子弟，咸往近郊求學；凡此諸端，均足徵農民經濟情形之良好。設無去歲長江流域之汜濫，及華北之早魃為虐，農業之復興，當有長足進步也。茲將過去一年農業情形之特點，略述如下；</p>
<p>一·農產收穫</p>
<p>中國之主要農產為糧食與棉花，據中央農業實騐所估計，其近三年來收穫數量之比較，略如下表：（以百萬市担為單位）</p>
<p>去年糧食收穫總量，較廿三年多百分之六，較廿二年少百分之二。稻麥為糧食之大宗，去歲之麥總產量為四萬二千二百萬擔，而廿三年則爲四萬五千萬擔，廿二年則為四萬五千一百萬擔，是去歲產量較前二年减少百分之六。穀之總產量爲八萬五千一百萬擔，而廿三年則為七萬三十六萬擔，廿二年則為八萬六千九百萬擔，雖央歲產量較少於廿二年，但較廿三年則增加百之十六。豐收之結果，致去歲秋冬米價不高，進口洋米亦少。至去歲棉之總產量較廿三年减百分之十，較廿二年减百分之十五。華北則因春早歉收，比廿三年减百分之廿五，比廿二年减百分之十五，中部則較廿二年减百分之十六，而較廿三年則增加百分之十。</p>
<p>二·農產價格</p>
<p>下列數種主要農產，係根據上海躉售之價格：</p>
<p>一·米——去歲米之產量，較前年多百分之十六，已見上述。在上半年新米未上巿以前，蘇米平均每擔十三元，湘米每擔九元。下半年新米上巿之後，蘇米降至平均每擔十一元五角，湘米降至每擔八元一角，較廿三年略遜，但較廿二年則高出百分之三十五。</p>
<p>二·麥——去歲上半年平均麥價每擔三元七角，至下半年因歉收即漲至每擔四元二角，較廿三年貴百分之十四，廿二年貴百分之三十。</p>
<p>三·棉——去歲上半年之平均棉價，標花三十四元，　寳花四十一元，下半年標花漲至三十六元，靈寶花漲至四十二元，與前兩年相較，此項變動雖由歉收所致，但比較前一年之價則無大出入也。</p>
<p>四·絲——去年絲價特漲，上半年上等廠經每擔平均四百六十元，决落至四百兀，旋又回至四百六十元，最後三個月則平均每擔七百廿元。至絲價之漲，謂由於產量减少，勿寗謂為由於海外需要之增加也。</p>
<p>三·農產之對外貿易</p>
<p>據海關報吿，去年主要進口農產，米，麥，棉及菸葉之進口總値，將及一萬八千八百萬元，　廿三年則爲二萬二千八百萬元，廿二年則爲二萬九千四百萬元。　　　　　　　　　　百萬元，較前年增加百分之四十一；麥之進口計値三千六百萬元，較前年增加百分之十四。棉花因前年國內豐收，去年進口總値，僅四千一百萬元，而前年則為九千萬元。至去歲菸葉進口總値，則自前年之三千一百萬元，降至八百五十萬元。蓋國內產量增加而民衆購買力又低减也。</p>
<p>絲，茶，桐油，花生等十二種農產之出口總値，去年共計　萬三千一百萬元，至廿三年則為一萬九千二百萬元，廿二年則為二萬四千七百萬元。去年出口之較勝於前年者，實由海外對於桐油，花生，生油及生絲之需要增加所致。去年桐油出口總値計四千二百萬元，較前年增百分之五十八，較廿二年增百分之三十七，花生及生油之出口總値計三千萬元，較前年增百分之八十三，較廿二年增百分之三十一，棉花出口總值計二千八百萬元，較廿二年减百分之十八，較前年則增百分之三十九。蛋及蛋製品之出口總値計三千二百萬元，較前年增百分之六，較廿二年减為百分之十二。</p>
<p>四·幣制改革之影響</p>
<p>去秋鄕村間信用緊縮，農產商販，缺乏接濟，致農民欲售却農產以償價而有不能，巿塲　索，而農產之價亦跌。甫自宜布新幣制後，鄕村市塲稍形混亂，但不數日即回復常態，而交易大增。因素習藏銀之富農，着手購藏麥，棉，結果農產之價，遂於數星期間增漲一二成。農產之價驟漲，頗使其時售却出產之小農，獲相當之利焉。</p>
<p>五·農村建設</p>
<p>關於農村建設特舉其最顯著者數事如下：</p>
<p>（甲）治螟螟為我國種稻之巨患，種稻區域，受損綦鉅。據中央農業實騐所之估計，僅江浙兩省因螟所受損失，年逾一萬萬元。科學家雖已發見治螟之有效方法，因乏完善組織之舉措，致其法不能行之有效，去年八月地方政府與中央農事實騐所，協力從事於江寗縣之治螟動員，因而當年之稻，不再為嫇所苦，十二日中録除螟卵的七千萬塊，使四十萬畝之稻田，絕除螟害，此項工作所費極尠，而可為農民挽救巨量之　，以增其出產焉。</p>
<p>（乙）交通近敎年來雖多數公路亙貴鄉村，但公路運費過昂，故農產之運銷，首惟鐵路是賴。故邇來新建之鐵路，已資農產以運銷之便利，其運費已减低十分之一二矣。</p>
<p>（丙）農產之改良　關於增加農產之量及改善其質之工作，巳會述及。政府歷年設立棉產改進所，絲產改進所，茶葉改良場，及中央農業實騐所等機關，從事技術上之硏究，各方面俱有長足進步，即如全國經濟委員會之棉產改良所，已自中央巿場推展其工作於鄉村。在改進棉產之前，市場之普通改良種棉含水分百分之十五，及其他雜物百分之十；今則水分巳减至千分之十六，其他雜物减至千分之十四矣。</p>
<p>稻麥為我國最重要之農產，以前農業學校及省立農事試騐場均有多少改良工作，但常缺乏經費及技術人材。去歲全國經濟委員會及實業部方合辦稻麥改進所，經費旣裕，復聚全國人材着手於範圍廣大之工作矣。</p>
<p>（丁）農村合作過去數年中，我國農村，合作運動頗盛，但各團體各以其見解及方法而組織之。中外合作專家常息其長遠如此，則合作運動，將難吿成功。近來實業部添設合作司，全國經濟委員會設立合作事業委員會，中央政治學校添設合作學院，在希冀此等新機關，能改正過去之錯誤而俾其立法與推進及訓練合作指導員；咸歸於實際及有效之途，以求將來之進步，農村合作之運動，將迅為鄉村生活之經濟社會復興之中動力也。</p>
<p>（戊）農村金融銀行以農產之廣衆，對於信用調劑，迄於今日，亦只盡其滄海一粟之力而巳。但近數年來，社會巳漸識其供獻之益，銀行經由合作社放欵之結果，耕牛獲見增加，廣大區域之地，獲用改良種籽並充分肥料，並獲掘井而灌溉，築堤以防水，以前鄉村利率，常在年息三分至十分之間，今亦降至二三分矣。農村放欵雖尙在試騐之中，但巳證明如對於農民，在適當時期貨以低利之相當疑額，則必能增益其利用土地勞力效力也。</p>
<p>（已）土地制度去年我國農事學者間對於佃耕問題，極形重視，蓋謂土地所有制度，實為鄉村經濟之基礎，除非將土地問題充分解决，則改進農業之種種工作，祇徒表面，且其價値亦屬有限也。然除山西當局擬即以土地村公有見諸實行外，尙不過僅為學者間之討論問題，但頗引起通國之注意。</p>
<h3>工業情形</h3>
<p>去歲我國工業備歷銀根緊縮之艱辛，蓋多數工廠大都資本不足，向恃銀行貸欵為營運資本，去歲利率過高，即地位最優之工廠，亦不得不限制其經常產量。其與一般商業關係最多之錢業，亦牧縮放欵，商家因無由儲集存貨。益以洋貨競爭，外匯放長，私運日增，國貨疊受打擊。十一月新幣制之施行，即期銀根鬆動，外匯見縮，因而提高物價，以資挽救國內工業之衰敝，而助長其發展也。</p>
<p>一方近歲進口稅率之增高，足以鼓勵國貨數量及種類之日增，在輕工業尤甚，且在政府扶掖之下，更進而從事於基本工業之創設。但國內大規模之工業，尙在萌芽時期，而國內創設最早並且發展最良之股份公司企業，厥維銀行，從而銀行應指導工廠企業，俾其組織趨於健全，更助長其發展，明屬責無旁貸，惜乎迄今至多僅畀以短期放欵而已，茲試分述去歲各業情形於下：</p>
<p>紡織業我國紡織業之弱點，由於全盛時分紅過鉅，折舊太少，致使其事業在去歲信用緊縮巿面蕭索之下，即不能支持，結果大多數工廠咸被迫而陷於全部或局部停工之境。六月末停工之錠，的佔全體四成，嗣新棉上市，雖有多廠勉强復工，但至年終未開工之紡錠織機，尙達百分之二十五。而外商所營紡織廠，則由於理財穩健，並蒙低利之惠，厥狀甚佳。</p>
<p>去歲一年中紗價異常低廉，六月間標紗價格每包的一百五十八元九角，實為十五年來最低紀錄，逮幣制改革後，進口棉市稍减，從而紗價驟漲，自十月間之每包一百七十七元六角六分，一躍而至十一月之每包一百九十五元四角七分。然而紗價雖漲，棉價亦昂。因美印棉之金價，隨外匯匯率之低落而增高，而國產棉價亦連帶上升矣。</p>
<p>自二十三年七月至二十四年六月，全國棉紗產量，計組紗三，二九八，五〇四公擔，細紗七二五，六一一公擔，雜紗七一，五二九公擔，綜計叫，〇九五，六四六公擔，就中國廠所產，粗紗佔百分之七十七，細紗佔百分之三十三，雜紗佔百分之四十一；日廠所產，粗紗佔百分之二十一，細紗估百分之六十六，雜紗佔百分之五十六；其餘則爲英廠所產。</p>
<p>在此狀况之下，可足述者，則為我國多數廠家，於此不景氣中，不得不撙節開支，故生產成本已見减低，同時多數舊機亦設法改良，並且增置相當自動布幾矣。</p>
<p>繅絲業歲初絲價固極低廉，但至六月國外需要增加，價遂上漲，至十一月竟開近數年來之新紀錄。去歲一年中絲價，乃自最低之每　三百八十元，一躍而　七百元以上。</p>
<p>去歲愼選無病蠶種之結果，所產生絲，品質勻度均見進步，姑置去歲受國外偶然影響之助於不論，此實可期為絲業界之永久利益也。</p>
<p>一十四年蠶繭總產額一百四十萬　，生絲總產額九萬五千擔，就中江浙兩省產六萬姐，四川，湖北，山東共一萬　，廣東一萬五千担，江浙所產佔總產額百分之六十三，較上年增加百分之三十。去歲全國　絲廠開工者約三百家，　　車計十二萬三千架，但隨市　及絲價之變動而時有增减。即以江浙兩省而論，年初開工者的二十家，但自六月以後即逐漸增加，至十月開工者已達九十叫家，繅絲達亦達二萬四千架。</p>
<p>麵粉業去歲麵粉之產消，尙稱順利，麵粉業都獲盈餘，國產小麥尙供不應求，仍依賴進口洋麥，就中允以澳洲麥為多。</p>
<p>去歲粉麵粉廠開工者共九十四家，就中上海十四家，無　四家，濟南七家，靑島六家，天津五家，開封三家，其餘各地計五十八家。全年麵粉總產額共七九，　六八，五一八袋（每袋重四十九磅）二十二年增加七，八二一，四六八袋，較二十三年增加八，九〇九，三五六袋。全年國產麵粉總銷額共七八，九九九，四一八袋。全年進口外國麵粉共五一〇，四九六公　，約　二，〇〇〇袋，較二十三年减少三七六，〇〇〇袋。</p>
<p>水泥業　　二十三年水泥業　享高價之利，但去歲因金融緊迫，致　築工程减少，水泥銷路亦　落。加以外貨　銷甚烈，故國內各廠幾無不重大損失。</p>
<p>由於這費過大，陝西，江西，四川等內地均自設　廠，粵省官營士敏上廠且增置新機。故無論需要　减，價格雖低，而全年水泥總產量仍有三百七十七萬桶之多，較二十三年增加三十六萬桶。</p>
<p>火柴業　去歲火柴業承上年罷敝之餘，依然如故。華北福律等處，私運火柴充斥市塲，其納統稅之國產廠家，反因與私貨競爭而遭損失。中部七省之廠家，爲防生產過剩，設立火柴同業聯銷機關，實行以來，頗見成效，其在此聯銷區域以外之冀，魯兩省廠家，則情況極壤。國內各地之我國及日本，瑞士之火柴廠家，曾擬共同採用比額生產制度，苟能見諸實行，則非特國內生產過剩可以免除，即私運亦可稍戢。</p>
<p>去歲全國火柴廠開工者計六十九家，安全火柴總產額計二六七，九三二箱，硫化磷火柴總產額計五二四，四八六箱，散裝火柴計八，三八二箱，全年共銷火柴的七四八，〇一八箱，與二十三年相彷彿，較二十二年則减少九八，七六三箱。</p>
<p>製糖業　我國進口糖稅之高，足以鼓勵製糖業之發展。粵省府建置煉糖廠六處，其中三廠業巳出貨，桂省府亦着手建置一廠。向以產精供給長江上游之四川，亦為製總有望之區，正計劃建置一大規模煉糖廠於重慶。</p>
<p>我國甘蔗與甜菜之產量雖尙不足，但製糖之利甚厚，目前糖之產量雖年僅十五萬担，然可相信藉保護關稅之力，如能防止目前可　之私運，則不出數年或能生產大量之糖以自給也</p>
<p>化學工業我國近年輕工業發達之速，遂令工業家傾向於化畢原料之製造。其最顯著者則為浦口建設中之七百萬元資本硝酸氬廠；上海浦東巳開工之二百五十十萬元資本酒精廠；天津製造各種染料之有機染料廠：及山西製造酸類酒精與以太之新設化學工廠。</p>
<h3>經濟建設</h3>
<p>年來國難頻仍，舉如二十年興二十四年之水災，二十年東北之淪失，共產　延猖　於中部各省，為時甚久，農村破產用致購買力之减退，以及去歲華北時局之擾　，與夫銀價奇昂與物價脫離素來相聯關係，而致我國幣制金融之陷於危急，比比皆是。然値此多難之際，在經濟建設發展方面，亦有多少物質進步足以稱述者存焉。我國民鑒於國家地位之衰弱，不得不感覺自助之必要，更急有待於鞏固經濟基礎之策畫。而年來關於此等計劃，已有相當成績可紀者。</p>
<p>各省地方政府當局間有自動從事於發展交通及創辦實業，其成績頗有可觀者。此外中夾之全國經濟委員會資於國庫協欵，及得國聯所派技術專家之諮詢贊襄，而獲以擴大其工作及於全國。惟該會亦以目前資力有限，不得不專着重於數種緊要工作，並限於擇要之區域，因之專主從事於公路水利及公衆衛生與復興農業數者。茲略舉其去歲成績於下：</p>
<p>公路與運輸迄去歲十月末，該會恊築之公路已逾兩萬公里，已　路面可通汽車者的及其半。下列係去年終中央協築公路之概况：（單位公里）</p>
<p>該會更恊設各省公路交通委員會以備諮詢，從事建議關於交通規則及公共汽車行駛與交通便利等事，如汽油與急救站以及電話路標及巡警之設備，其最要工作，則在統一車捐而　除其苛稅。</p>
<p>水利　世界國民之福利，當鮮有如我國之倚重於消水者，在我國平陸，民衆安寗，當視河道堤防之狀况而定；若遇决定，則蓄害隨之。然不獨水患而已，若干地方，其安全　旱之法，則惟慘淡經營以資灌溉之井渠是賴。全國經濟委員會之最初治水工作，係接辦全國水災委員會工振處工程，其始範圍亦有限，逮去歲方改為全國治理水利最高行政機關。該會第一偉大灌溉工程為西北之涇渭渠，去春竣工，可溉田四萬五千萬畝，俾成為產棉之重耍中心。至在西北甘肅寗夏與蘇皖接境之水利工程，則或已竣工，或尙未畢★叉在距漢口不遠之鄂西金口涸塡湖荒過九十萬畝，去歲四月竣工。當去夏洪水汜濫之際，復多方注意長江黃河流域，從事於救急及修堤之工作。</p>
<p>公衆衛生　該會在公衆衛生方面，經衛生處設立實騐調查機關，公開衛生實騐，訓練各種衛生教育及醫術人材，復協助地方當局從事於防疫及清潔衛生與科學研究，頗多有益工作。</p>
<p>復興農業　我國以農爲本，海外對於我國農產之需要一增，則我國之對外貿易媽獲益匪淺，農民之購買力媽可增加，而全國經濟媽有恢復氣象。故農村之復興建設，洵爲方今經濟發展之要務，已往數年間，全國經濟委員會媽次第從事於改良蠶種，改進棉產，並組織合作社以增進馬燈之福利。</p>
<p>育蠶　近年我國出絲出口之减少，首由絲質之退化，而絲質退化，則半由蠶種之低劣，半由繅絲方法之陳　。蠶絲改進委員會因設實騐場，以研究我國良種而蕃殖之，爲增育良種起見，復在南京杭州兩處設場孵育。同時又在蘇州滸墅關及鎭江之蠶桑學校及各地育蠶所傳布最近育蠶方法。蠶絲改良委員會與浙江省政府合作之成績，媽二十三年秋絲價低落達於極點，蠶　無人過問，浙江省政府乃收買全省秋　，聯合江浙兩省最佳繅絲廠，俾其特別監視繅製，所繅之絲，品質極佳，遂獲以善價出售於世界巿場，去年復擴充工作，售出優良之絲四千餘包，獲利甚優。</p>
<p>棉業二十二年十月成立之棉業統制委員會，主從事於改良棉產，並求最後亦致力於紡織方面。其由中央棉產改進所與蘇·豫·秦·冀等省政府合作之結果，獲播改良棉種於一百三十七萬六千畝之棉田，不惟棉質優良，並且產量亦增。該委員會首要任務，係調查研究，故多設實騐場以硏究植棉之種種問題，允注意於芟除害蟲，為改善運銷及排除居棉農與廠商間之商販，設立合作社六十三處，並設中央棉產運銷總辦事處於上海，以求產銷之直接，更釐定最良棉花標準，减少其水分及攙雜，益以與各大學合作，而獲有訓練　棉之指導及工作人材之便利。</p>
<p>鐵路建設方今鐵道部各省政府及商辦鐵路公司，共定有建築的二千五百公里新鐵路之計畫，去歲已完成九分之三。粵漢鐵路以英國庚子賠欵作擔保，二十三年六月在上海押借一百五十萬磅，去歲獲繼續進行完成七百二十公里之新路。山西完成自蒲州至原平南北縱貫該省之狹軌鐵路六百三十三公里，該路建築資本山山西省政府自醫，全路竣工時，可與平綏鐵路接軌。二十一年中國銀行曾聯合各銀行恊助浙省政府剏建自杭州至江西邊境玉山之　路，去歲復延長二百九十一公里迄於南昌，現復着手延長至萍鄉，竣工時可於湖南株州與粵漢鐵路接軌，自後粵滬交通可由鐵路以達。隴海路去歲　西向自西安至咸陽延長二十公里，東向自大沛至老窰延長三十公里，此外復有數短距離鐵路正事建築，此等　交通建設泃足以輔助內地農產之運銷而資其便利也。</p>
<p>上述各項建設工作、如公路·水利·農村·合作·蠶絲·植棉·鐵路等，本行及共他各銀行，均直接間接予以恊助焉。</p>

<h3>職業婦女的黃金年齡</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>婦女服務於社會，甚麽年齡最適當？這個問題，現已有若干國，加以研究。美國紐的「摩登雜誌」的編者，會向內巿十一家大商店中調查。據其調查的結果，該十一家中，共有女售貨員七八三入。年齡興人數的分配如下：</p>
<p>在這八組中，平均的售貨成績，以二十六至三址歲的那一組為冠，但個人的成績，却以一位三十二歲的某女售貨員為最優，他的統計，是以一九三五年，八月和十二月，二個月中的售出貨品，與貨欵收入針算的。而當他調查時，曾得該十一家公司的高級職員，與以不少的扶助。所以他這統計，是相當可靠的</p>
<p>但　芝加哥「小雜　」，編者的統計，却路有出入。被調查的，是七家大公司的女舊貨員，二六九人·年齡與人數的分配如下：</p>
<p>在這四組中，個人的售貨成績，雖是三十一和四十三歲的二位最高，但平均的計算起來，還是二六至三五歲的那組為最優。所以芝加哥摩而斯百貨公司的經理說，『年老的女售貨員，果然是不能招徠主顧，但太年靑的，也往往不能使人滿意。惟有中年的女售貨員，不只普遍的對顧客，有相當而不使人惹厭的讓貌，同時，更困具有相當的家庭負担，所以對於職務，是比了年靑的，勤奮得多。主顧購物時，往往就詢於中年的女售貨員，想從她們的生活經騐中，得一些生活的敎訓。爲的是年老的女售貨員，總是那麽的頑固，年靑的女售貨員，總是那麽的浮跺而不切實際，這便是中年的女售貨員，最受人歡迎的理由。——女售貨員，不是好來塢的電影明星，也不是百老匯的歌舞明星。女售貨員所須具備的，是不過於年老，也不過於年靑的年齡。不過老，是避免顧客的惹厭。不過於年靑，是因為具有相當的商業經騐。</p>
<p>俄國，近來也很注意於婦女的年齡與工作的關係。據一九三四年的統計，從事於織染業的婦女，生產能力最高的，是二十六至二十八歲的婦女。但個人成績最佳的，是三十二歲的一位，農具製造業的婦女，平均是二十七至三十歲。個人成績最佳的，是三十與三十一歲的二位。製革業的婦女，平均是二十八至三十歲最優。個人成績，也是一位三十歲的列第一。一九三五年的統計，織染業的婦女，平均生產力，二十六至三十歲最高。農具製造業，二十九歲至三十二歲。製革業，二十八歲至三十一歲。雖然這種調查，並不足以代表整個俄國的勞動婦女，但是從這一個統計中，也可以見到俄國婦女們的生產能力的最高年齡，在三十歲左右。或是說，從二十五六至三十三歲，那是準不會錯的。</p>
<p>從美俄二國的統計看來，職業婦女的黃金年齡，最早，總也得自二十五歲才開始。這一點，是頗足以使我國的職業婦女們猛省的。</p>
<h3>我國婦女的偉大</h3>
<p>— （楊志剛）</p>
<p>這是目下國際婦女一點値得紀念的行動：　　德國訓練六百萬女子，以備戰時替國家服務；意國全國婦女將其結婚時指戒送交政府，作為抵抗國聯對意制裁之用；阿國婦女自動蹕丈夫出征；還有美國羅斯福夫人將十决播音演說的七萬餘元美金全數捐助慈善團體。</p>
<p>國際婦女是這樣，但是中國的婦女呢？據國際貿易局發表：「過去九個月，我國婦女消耗品之輸入，如香水，脂粉等，數在百萬以上。」</p>
<p>這是我國婦女驚人的消耗費，也就是我國婦女的偉大。</p>
<h3>婦女與兒童</h3>
<p>— 乃常</p>
<p>——為兒童節而作——</p>
<p>在「女人的天國」的美國，有一部分做丈夫的男人，每逢假日的時候便帶着自己的孩子們到公園裏去，任由孩子們自己去玩，做父親的則坐在長椅上呆望着天際。這看守孩子們的責任旣然交給了丈夫？做母親的女人們，便可以自由自在地去會友，或是到什麽地方去娛樂了。</p>
<p>在另一個男女比較平等的國度裏——蘇聯的女人都跟身人一樣在各種工業部門文化部門裏工作，沒曠照顧到孩子們，所以他們有托兒所等等的組織，來代母親們看守着孩子，敎育着孩子。</p>
<p>但是，我們這個决殖民地的中國，女人旣不能像資本主義黃金國的女人一樣，把孩子交給了丈夫；也不能像社會主義國家的蘇聯一樣，把孩子交給托兒所。我們一般的中下等家庭的女人們，是只有自己親自來看守着孩子，敎管着孩子。不過，這些做了母親的女人們，很多是沒有能力，也卽是沒有敎養孩子們的常識。一個孩子的性情，嗜好，本來都是容易了解的，但是在這般女人的眼光裏，孩子們的性情與嗜好，便成為不可理解的凍西，他們覺得孩子可憎時便任意的打撻，覺得孩子可愛時，又過度的溺愛。是以不少的孩子們的命運，都斷送在這些無知的母親的手裏。</p>
<p>因為家庭敎育與學校敎育不能恰當的配合着，所以有許多孩子們都生存在矛盾的環境裏。我們試想想：比方孩子們在學校裏學到了禮讓，仁愛，淸潔，但是當他回到家裏時，母親的無目的的敎養方法，却給了他爭奪，自私，憎惡，齷齪等等的壞影響。處在這樣矛盾環境之中的孩子，因為中國的家庭敎育比學校敎育給他們的影響更深刻的緣故，很多是變得更壞了。</p>
<p>兒童是國家未來的主人翁，我們每年以四月四日為兒童節，便是希望把這個意義擴大下去。但是在我們中國裏，女人對於兒童應負的責任是比男人們大過千百倍的，所以希望自今年的兒童節起，女入們應該把家庭敎育與學校敎育配合起來！</p>

<h3>楊美眞女士談　美國婦女生活的現狀</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>勞動的勞勳，享樂的享樂；</p>
<p>吃穿住舒服，有錢萬事足！</p>
<p>時間：二十五年四月一日下午三時</p>
<p>地點：中華婦女節制協會會客室人物：本報記者楊美眞碩士，劉王立明</p>
<p>（慕啟）向西開的一問會客室，壁間掛着幾幅西洋畫，案頭供四盆鮮花，楊美眞女士正和劉夫人談話，楊女士是一位態度端莊的女性，穿黑呢皮頒大衣，她們談得很出神。</p>
<p>門外輕輕地即門，書僮走來開門，請記者入內，兩人都起立與記者鞠躬為禮，劉夫人介紹過後，各自就位，於是開始談話。</p>
<p>記者——女士剛自美返國，想來對於彼邦婦女問題，觀察很透澈，請隨便發表一些。</p>
<p>楊女士——很慚愧！我在美除讀書以外，不曾有空去考察，就怕不能供給良好的材料。</p>
<h3>楊美眞女士</h3>
<p>記者——女士出國的時候，曾到過歐洲的麽？</p>
<p>楊女士——前年五月放洋，先赴瑞典，代表中國參加第十七屆世界婦女節制恊會及巴黎國際婦女代表大會，復住英·意·法·德·瑞士·挪威·蘇聯·各國考察婦女運動，十月間渡美，入本雪文尼亞大學攻社會學，於去年畢業，今始返國。</p>
<p>記者——此刻請談談美國婦女的現狀。</p>
<p>楊女士——美國婦女的活動能力，値得羨慕。她們一出了學校，就服務社會做了幾年事纔結婚，婚後主持家政，但有的因丈夫失業，或經濟不充裕再出來做事，以所獲補助家用。大概美國婦女的動向：有的在政治上活動，有的找尋職業：有的享高貴生活；有的趨向勞動界；大多數還是出嫁後做賢妻良母。女子職業以敎員及商店職員為最普遍，中小學敎員，女子佔百分之八十，店員在百分之九十以上</p>
<p>記者——美國一般主婦對家政能負責處理麽？</p>
<p>楊女士——據我所知，她們都能勞動，除少數富貴及享樂的以外，大概對家事負完全責任的。如烹調，縫紉，洗滌，育兒，以至揩窗洗地板等，都自己操作，因為他們中下家庭，不僱婢僕，與我國情形，略有差異。</p>
<p>記者——照此說來，美國婦女大有苦樂不均的情形，請女士作一總括的批評。</p>
<p>楊女士——總括的說：美國婦女智識程度比他國為高，很有團結的力量；能自力奮鬥，找尋生活，婦女運動，已達成功之路。不過她們也有許多缺點，例如：浮噪，富虛榮心；家庭支用無預算；對人生認識淺薄，每以享樂為中心；夫婦意見稍有不合，動輒離異；這些似乎不及富有道德觀念的中國婦女，也許是我一偏之見吧。</p>
<p>記者——這是關係都市婦女的，那末農村婦女的生活怎樣？</p>
<p>楊女士——農村婦女富於勞動精神，這一點美國與我國很有相同之處，不過她們都受過相當敎育，星期日也有集會，聯絡感情，作正當娛樂，在我國農村裏，一時還辦不到哩。</p>
<p>記者——留美的中國學生怎樣？</p>
<p>楊女士——留美學生大概都好，從國難以後，誰都感覺非有實學不足以報國，而且近年來研究科學的人比以前多些，不過有，都分中學皋業就去留學，意志薄弱，經騐毫無，易入歧途。我主張應嚴格規定大學畢業後，服務幾年，對祖國有深切認識，於所學有相當成就，然後出洋留學，纔有意義。</p>
<p>記者——女士對美國備戰的情形，有所聞見麽？</p>
<p>楊女士——略有所見，美國人民也很怕戰爭，而且反對戰爭，和平運動，風行一時，不過政府仍在積極準備中。</p>
<p>記者——女士返國後將如何致力於社會？</p>
<p>楊女士——多做小事，不說大話。</p>
<p>記者——女士對婦女界有什麽指示？</p>
<p>楊女士——很希望智識婦女，多做實際工作，為貧苦婦女謀幸福，救人卽是救己，多做一分事，更多一分救國救民的機會。</p>

<h3>日本女子衣服的革命</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日日女子最觸目的是一個高而大的髮髻，長袖大服的衣裳，和高跟的木屐。這三點是日本女子特徵，任何各國所沒有的。日本女子的高髮髻，大都要請人代梳，每决要一兩三元。普通人都要逢着應酬或是節令，打扮起來，頭髮上挿得花花綠緣。夜裏睡覺，要用高而小的木枕，墊在頸下，不到四五天又紊亂起來了。所以一般日本女子，大都嫌惡他們的風俗，而改換普通的髮髻。女學校裏已經完全剪髮，要到畢業之後才把頭髮留起來，預備出閣。東京女子比較摩登，剪髮的很多？吾則作普通的髮髻，而加着幾條燙髮的波紋。</p>
<p>日本女子的髮髻雖已漸漸的解放了，但是這件衣服和腰裏的帶子，還是流傳着。有個日本人說倘然全日本人的衣服，將袖子减小，所節省的費用，足供大戰三年。本人的大袖子，是可放零碎物件的，等於兩隻衣袋。但是袖口太大，很易脫落。而和服上又無袋的，不能貯藏物件。他們的衣服全靠一條很闊的帶子束着。所以大風起時，或是走得太快了，便要露出裏面大紅的襯裙。於是日本女子心急慌忙的時候，一躍一蹴的，十分發噱。</p>
<p>這條帶子除了束衣之外便是唯一的裝飾品，價値常比衣服貴至數倍。在暑天腰裏繫着這條闊帶子，眞是難受的。就是已成習慣的日本女子，也莫不怨恨的。因此年輕女子紛紛穿著洋服，現在已比我國上海反而多了。結帶子的方法十分複雜，由三四件東西結成的。我國女留學生初到日本，和西洋女子一樣，很喜歡借件日本衣服，嘗試一下？但是這個結，却學習幾决也不易熟練的。</p>
<p>最近因為女子紛紛穿著洋服，日本衣服材料的銷路大不景氣。一方面因日本女子的衣服絕不像我國女子的衣服，式樣時刻變更的。他們的衣服，除了花紋質地之外，沒有什麽變動。一件衣服至少可以穿四五年，不受影響。於是最近有人發明了個新方法，將女子的衣服分為上下兩截，可以隨意更換穿着，而以腰帶為上下衣服的連絡。這樣可使女子由嘗試而减少穿著洋裝。不久各大公司將努力宣傳，開衣服革命展覽會等為號召。但日本女子的衣服，是杏能合於現代化，尙是懷疑。這種不澈底的衣服革命，未必能挽回景氣的。日本紡績業，旣受國內摩登女子的影響，除了提倡衣服革命來挽救之外，唯一方法，還是推銷到我國來，反而要比在他們國內容易暢銷。讀者對日本以衣服革命抵制洋服，應作何種感想。</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞的女英雄</h3>
<p>— 裴兪</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的婦女委員可以和男子同樣的稱爲戰士。在戰爭初起時，婦女們已把丈夫的劍擦得　亮，　得鋒利。但是　創備戰尙不足以表示伊們的勇敢偉大。不久，第一隊的阿比西甩亞女子軍就組織成功了。創立者是一個女子，人稱「變為一朶花的入」。</p>
<p>一年以前，伊曾做一個夢，夢裏伊騎了一匹馬，在一隊女子軍的前面，去做保衛國家的工作。伊是受了法國女英維貞德Joan　o　　Aro。建立功績的激勵，而開始組織一女子軍，起初伊不但受人　笑，而且還遭人反對咧。後來由激勵而生的偉大建議漸漸獲得以前會譏笑過伊的婦女的贊助了。他們便成羣結隊接二連三的投到伊的旗幟下去。在數週內伊所組織的女子軍巳有三千名英勇的女戰士了。</p>
<p>這位領袖的眞姓名是查兒姑士Voy　Zero　abebech　Charkoz，一個富有資產的靑年女子。伊自己的身上穿一套歐洲式灰色布的軍裝，外面再披着一件活潑的紅色披肩。伊所統率的軍隊，訓練旣嚴格，紀雜又嚴明，軍器都是新毛瑟（Mauser）的自動來福槍，由伊自己供給和支配的。第一隊的女子軍剛組織成功，伊就率領伊們浩浩蕩蕩在一片慶祝勝利的歡呼聲中，出發到岡達爾Gondar前綫去。伊們到達了目的地後，就有部落婦女自願來參加。伊們都會用舊式的來福槍，而且能够和伊們丈夫一樣的放得很巧妙很正確。這些部落女戰士的胸前都掛着聖母瑪利亞的肖像或徽章，肩頭都搧着一枝來福槍。他們也能够像男子一般的拼命殺敵，絕不退縮。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞軍隊的將領密凱爾Dedjasmatchapte　Mikael的夫人看見意大利的軍隊已經進佔山巓，得了優越的地位，伊就力勸丈夫去攻擊。但是這位將領是小心翼翼的人，十分謹愼的。他怕中了敵兵誘入的詭計，所以不敢輕舉妄動。他認為最好的戰略是保守着敵兵難以攻取的原來地位。</p>
<p>這位英勇果斷的夫人却另有一種意見。伊走進營帳中去，穿起了軍裝，召集一百五十名敢死兵，騎了騾子和伊同去攻擊意大利兵。勇敢熱烈視死如歸的兵士立刻集合在伊的面前了。伊也跨上了一匹騾子。他們在一陣喊殺聲中衝向前去攻擊敵兵了。</p>
<p>意大利的兵士看見前來攻擊的是一批人騾，統率的是一個女子，便不以為意。不料這决的攻擊時閒雖短，攻勢却是非常猛烈。這位謹愼小心的阿軍將領，聽見了暴發的槍聲，連忙率領援軍術過去接應。但是當他衝到戰塲的時候，發見他所率領的援軍並不需要。許多意大利的兵士被殺和受傷。這位勇敢善戰的夫人一騾當先，領了伊的一支隊建奇功的敢死兵，帶了從戰敗的敵兵那裏俘得的來福槍和軍需品，得意揚揚地奏凱而回去了。（節譯W.J.Makini原著的”Women　March　to　War“原文載於一九三五年十一月十六日出版之Pearson's　Meeky#2364）</p>
<h3>嫁後</h3>
<p>— 朱瑛女士</p>
<p>國華：</p>
<p>之玖：</p>
<p>那天，雪花飛舞的傍晚，我靠在窗口，思量着婚後的生活，忽然脚步自樓梯日送進房來，春，他挾着一疊卷子，微笑着走進來說：「蕙！你猜這是誰給你的信？」他一面放下卷子，一面從袋子裏掏出一封淡紅色的信來，我看信面上生疏的字跡，一時倒有些疑惑，拆開一看，才知是分別了　年的知友！欣慰何</p>
<p>你們說：「……你　經了那日的形式，　可增加事業的興趣，合力同心’以　　爲　　，來為社會效力，……」我看了之後，除感　你們的勉　之外，更得報吿些，關於我的生活</p>
<p>在社會上，我們眼見許多小姐們，在學校裏的時候，志高氣揚，要怎樣改革社會，怎樣　高女權，但是一出校門，便　在家事。或者　給一個丈夫，把過去的凌雲壯志，全都　在腦後，甚之接觸不良的社會，漸漸　化，抽烟，賭博，前後覺判若二人。這自然為我們所不</p>
<p>我自景海和你們分別後，便在本鄕　　　　沿鄕村小學，起先原是暫處之計，何况在　　僻壤，獨自生活呢？但是慢慢的　活潑潑的兒童，一羣羣在眼前跳着跑着，說着　着，處處流露天眞和熱情，一顆顆的生命之火，在我的面前炫耀，使我初來時的敷衍態度，也慢慢地從扣紐扣，束褲子，縛鞋帶中轉變過來，，為他們消磨掉整個的時間，而從興趣中忠實了自己的職務。這雖然和過去的志願，要負起整個社會的責任，不免相左，但他們是中國未來的主人翁，我居然能領導他們作將來踏進社會做人的預備，這又楚何等榮幸而値得自豪呢！</p>
<p>春依然在距白沿三里遠的中心校執敎，他本要叫我到那裏担任幼稚園，但我怎忍放　這三年來在一起生活着的孩子們呢？我們　不在一塊，但同是為了兒童敎育努力，目標是　一致的，精神更融合起來。</p>
<p>後天是滿月了，我仍要回白沿校，春也要回校去住了！我們又得重新振頓自己的工作。</p>
<p>最後，當告訴你們，我倆的愛，確如你們所說：「經了那次的形式，更加的團結與純掣」。</p>
<p>祝你倆百凡如意！　　蕙於菉葭</p>
<h3>何梅谷的妻子</h3>
<p>— 魏冰心</p>
<p>何梅谷的妻子，十分迷信。伊日常生活，不是往寺院裏去燒香，便是到庵堂裹去拜佛。而且，在家裏特地打掃乾凈一間房子，供着觀世音善蔭。伊每天自朝至暮，恭恭敬敬地，對着觀世音菩薩：敲着木魚，念着佛號。主婦應該料理的正經事情，反而放在腦後。這樣，自然荒廢了光陰，消耗了金錢。伊的丈夫梅谷，很不贊成，雖然時時甩好話勸阻，可是沒有一些效力。</p>
<p>有一天，梅谷忽然想到了一個軟化的方法，促使他的妻子自己覺悟鎭天念佛的討厭。於是，他便對他的妻子，接二連三地喊道：「太太！……太太……太太！……」自從早上喊起，一直喊到黃昏，簡直沒有休歇。</p>
<p>這位迷信的太太，郤也被丈夫喊得不耐煩起來了。伊惱怒地斥責梅谷道：「怎麼？你不是發了瘋了嗎？為甚麽道樣囉嘈？為甚麽老是呌着太太，呌得人頭昏腦漲？」</p>
<p>「哈哈」！梅谷笑道：「我偶然喊了你一天，你就覺得頭昏腦漲；你就惱怒，說我發瘋，斥我囉嘈。但是，你天天對着觀世音菩薩，要喊伊千萬　，難道伊不會覺得頭昏腦漲？難道伊不會惱怒，不說你發瘋，不斥你囉嘈嗎？」</p>
<p>梅谷的妻子，聽了這幾句話，才恍然大悟。從此以後，伊就不再喃喃地念佛號了。</p>

<h3>英美日的優秀軍艦</h3>
<p>— 台賓</p>
<p>據說在未來戰爭中海軍依然有强大的作用，所以，現今世界各主要國家，除拼命擴張空軍外，更積極擴充海軍。就中値得我們特別注意的，當然是在遠東角逐的被稱為世界三大海軍國的英美日。</p>
<p>一個國家的海軍力量之大小，當然要以其軍艦的數量和質量以及噸數來判定。因此，如果我們能知道某一國家的軍艦，尤其是優秀軍艦的情形，那也就可以明白它的海軍力量和發展方向如何了。現在，我們所要報吿的，首先就是英美日這三大海軍國現有的幾種優秀軍艦的情形。</p>
<p>在軍艦中，主要的計有四種：即戰艦（主力艦），航空母艦，甲級巡洋艦，潛水艇。這幾種軍艦，英美日當然都是有的，而且都是有其特別優良之點的。我們就在這裏來分別加以說明吧。</p>
<p>先說戰艦。據我們所知道的，英美日現有的作為代表的優秀戰艦的情況如下：</p>
<p>依據上表，首先應該注意的，是英國的那個代表戰艦無論在排水量上，在主砲的數量上，都較美日的强。本來，英美日的代表戰艦的主砲排水量等在數字上並沒有多大的差別，比如英國的較日美的僅多一門四〇桑基大砲；但就是這樣很小的數字上的差別，就是僅多一門四〇桑基的大砲，在戰場上往往也能左右勝負。而且，英國的那個勒爾孫戰艦有三個聯裝砲塔，每一個砲塔上置有四〇桑基大砲三門，都集中在艦的前部。美日的那個代表戰艦則都是設的四個砲塔，每一砲塔上置有四〇桑基大砲兩門；而且這四個砲塔並不是集中在艦的前部，乃是在艦的前後各設兩個砲塔的。這兩種裝置形式說來都有優點。將砲塔和大砲集中在前部的，容易指揮和防禦，但不消說是不能施行對於艦的後尾射擊的。反之，將砲塔和大砲分置在艦的前後，當然能施行前後射擊。不過，在英艦的設計者看來，在機電發達的今日，對於艦的後部射擊是沒有機會的。此外，在速力和航續力方面，英美日的代表戰艦也有一些差別。但就全　看來，英國的勒爾孫艦是較强大的，因而它也就有了被稱為世界第一大戰艦的資格了。</p>
<p>其次是航空母艦。這是飛機的移動根據地；它的作用是在以很大的速力航近敵國的領海，用飛機施行空中攻擊。英美日現有的航空母艦雖多不很完備，但它們的力量却也頗堪驚人。現在且舉出它們已有的而且是代表的航空母艦來說吧。請先看下表——</p>
<p>航空母艦也有大砲。據我們所知道的，日本的赤城就有二十桑基大砲十門，蒼龍也有十二桑基大砲十二門；美國的沙拉特加有二十桑基砲八門，……。但航空母艦的第一作用是在輸送飛機，所以它的力量主要的要由它所載飛機的多少及其速力來判定。由上表看來，雖然我們尙不明白日本的赤城蒼龍兩航空母艦所載飛機的數量，但就速力和我們已知的英美的所載飛機數量的事實看來，也可以說英美的航空母艦是較日本的為强大的。</p>
<p>上面所見到的戰艦和航空母艦都表現出了日本的似乎不及英美的强大。但是，在甲級巡洋艦和潛水艇方面的情形，便又當別論了。現在且先將英美日的代表巡洋艦作一個比較——</p>
<p>上表中的這幾隻英美日的代表巡洋艦都是最近幾年竣工的。就中英國的亞爾扎利竣工於一九三四年九月，美國的達斯加爾竣工於同年八月，日本的高雄竣工於一九三二年五月。所以說來都是很新式的。但若把這三者比較起來，那日本的高雄却居於英美的之上。比如英美的所置的主砲是二十桑基砲八門或九門，但日本的却置有同樣的砲十門；在速力方面，日本的也較英美的要多一二海　；還有主要部分的裝甲板，英美的是二吋，日本的則是三吋。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>在潛水艇方面，日本的與英美的比較起來也較佔優勢。從戰鬥力方面來比較，英日兩國的代表潛水艇都備有十二桑基砲一門，速力英國是二十二浬又四分之一，日本的是二十浬，至於美國的，則有十桑基砲一門，速力為十七浬。這樣，英日的代表潛水艇都似乎較美國的為優；同時，英國的潛水艇又因艦型不統一，所以說來也不及日本。因此，日本常常誇耀他們的潛水艇是駕凌在列强之上的。</p>
<p>其次，如果從總的方面來考察，那我們可以寫出如下的事實：到最近為止，英國共有軍艦三五二隻，總噸數為一，三七八，四三四噸；其中戰艦十五隻，四七四，七五零噸；航空母艦七隻，　，二七九，八八零噸；驅逐艦一九四隻，二三五，九四四噸，潛水艇六十六隻，六七，一一四噸。美國共有軍艦四二六隻，總噸數為一三六八，一五零噸；其中戰賤十五隻，四六四，〇〇〇噸；航空母艦七隻，一四六，五〇〇噸；Ａ級巡洋艦十九隻，一七六，七七五噸；Ｂ級巡洋艦十九隻，一六〇，五〇〇噸；驅逐艦三六六隻，三二五，一五五噸；潛水艇一〇〇隻，九一，九二〇噸。日本共有軍艦二四七隻，八六六，七〇四噸；就中戰艦九隻，二七二，〇〇〇噸；航空母艦六隻，八八，四二〇噸；Ａ級巡洋艦十四隻，一二三，五二〇噸；Ｂ級巡洋艦二六隻，一四四，三七五噸；驅逐艦一二二隻，一五二，二七〇噸；潛水艇七〇隻，八六〇四九噸。對於這個，我們還不能單從數字上來看，因為軍艦中還有新舊之分。及至現在，如果比較起來說，則是日本的舊艦最少，英國次之，美國最多。所以現刻英美日都在努力建造新艦，以代替舊的。</p>
<p>在最近倫敦的海軍會議中，英美日的衝突非常尖銳。關於主要的軍艦方面，日本主張减縮乃至廢除戰艦，航空母艦和甲級巡洋艦，這一點英美都表示反對；在另一方面，英美則主張廢除潛水艇，但這却遭到了日法的反對。</p>
<p>這樣的鬥爭的結果，是使日本於一月十五日退出了倫敦海軍會議。對於這個事實，如我們詳觀上述英美日的軍艦情形，再考察英美日的國情和它們在遠東所佔的地位和所行的政策，便可完全了解其究竟。這里是無須多說的。</p>
<p>現在，英法美三國已簽定了海軍條約，據美國海軍代表說從此可免海軍競爭。但這條約沒有遠東的日本增加，西歐的意德也未加入，所謂海軍競爭可免的話恐怕也只是說來好聽的；因為誰都知道日德意是目前軍備擴張最厲行的，它們旣離開了海軍條約，世界海軍競爭便無法避免；更何况現今世界各强國都正在準備戰爭呢？事實上，英國保守黨內閣不是已於三月二日發表了擴充海軍計劃嗎？政變以後的日本政府不是已增加了軍費預算嗎？所謂海軍競爭可免，眞是不知從何說起！</p>

<h3>怎樣做「校對」</h3>
<p>— 玄齡</p>
<p>「校勘之學」在古時是專門的學者做的，如淸代的戴東原和王念孫等是。到了現在，印刷術發達了，文化進步了，又加以各種職業都經過緻密地分工，於是從前的專門學者的工作——校勘之學，現在落到校對先生手裏面了。自然，從前的校勘是比現在的校對麻煩而細緻些，不特要校正字句之錯落，而且要考訂古籍之眞僞；單就今文和古文一點說，要校訂古書也非深通文字學不可，何况古籍之雕刻轉抄，遣誤獨多呢？但是現在的「校對」，我們也決不能輕易就看過牠。在現在，因為文化是世界的，所以文字的形式除於個體的字之外，又加上了若干的公式，圖表。所以看來「校對」的工作很粗淺，很簡單，但是如於此道有經騐的人，一定會說，如果沒有沈靜精細的頭腦，沒有相當的外國文字的學習，沒有相當的科學以及各種學問的素養，是不能做校對的。</p>
<p>做校對，先要通中國字和中國文。這裏之所謂「通」，雖不是說能認識金石甲骨以及古篆隸草等文字，能作鏗鏘調恊擲地有聲的皇皇文章，但是對於時下一般流行的正書——楷書——草書行書，時下常用的文句構成和文筆語調都非審熟不可。如果你僅能粗通文字，而於文章內容，文句之形式一點也不了解，那校對起來，你便非把校稿和原稿，逐字逐句，一一對照不可。而且如不以整句的意思來校訂該句中某字之或正或誤，你只是在校稿上按着讀一個字，又移到原稿上來指着讀一個字，那不但一點鐘只能校一兩千字，在速率上差得很遠，而且你這樣校對的結果，也是錯誤百出的。因為在原稿上有許多字可以被排錯的，如「為」字和「水」字，如「為」字和「歸」字，在行書上形相類似，因而大都被排字工人相互排錯，如校對者程度也等於排字工人，不是校對不出來嗎？從這點看來，所以除對於時行的正草等書應認識外，還要能大槪懂得文字的內容。那么不但「如」與「水」類之行書不能弄混，而且卽使在原稿上有原著者本人一時因筆誤而寫下的「音同字不同」或「形似而實異」以及「簡筆」「俗寫」等字，你都可以大膽地加以改正，而且能自信得過。並且你如果對校對有了經騐，你便能　現寫原稿的人經常的容易寫錯以及排字工人經常的容易排錯的某些字，由此你也可得出一些法則來。</p>
<p>其次是要細心。你不要以為你充分認識校稿上的字以及大槪懂得其意義，便以為就可以走馬看花似的校對了。殊不知校對决不是瀏覽或閱讀。我們雖不必逐字逐句以校稿對原稿，但我們决不可把一字一句甚至某些字之一點一劃或字句間及字句旁之標點忽略了。切不可因為領略玩味其文意，而就忘記了自己是在作校對，並不是在鑑賞或理解。你要知道，趣味和思想有時會使你離開了機械的嚴密的校對工作的。</p>
<p>剛一展開校稿，你便有你校對的次序，切不可馬上就照普通讀書的方法看下去。先就得注意「書眉」，看書頭上的標題——每頁頂上應有該書或該文之標題或章節目次——，其次是看每頁的番號。這是每一頁都得重複的工作，切不要以為大致不錯便忽略過去，而且這也是極容易疏忽的地方。其次看章節之標題。在這裏，你先便有「字釘」的號數之認識的準備工作。如不知道特號字，一號二號三號字等，你是不知道正文該用那種字，某項標題應用某號字的。卽或著着或編輯在原稿上批的有，但你不充分熟習，是不能把排字工人之錯誤改正的。而且在現在，尚有四號字和「新」四號字，五號字和「新」五號字等之差異，又有所謂斜體字和墨體字等，你如不熟習，便不能校對。其次是每一節之「提行」，這有一定的格式，這也是要看該稿作者的興趣而定，如文章大槪為退兩行排，如詩則有長行短行以及兩行高兩行低，如引用文之另提行，或退四行，諸如此類都要清楚。還有是標點。其中有句點，讀點分點，有破折號有引用號，有人名地名等等。要明白這些，大槪才能開始校對。</p>
<p>校對出錯誤時，又要用一些甚麽形式來改正和怎樣改正呢？如不有一定的方式和條理，有時雖經你改正，但在「二校」上還是錯誤依然，不然，便引起了另外的新的錯誤。所以對於某種錯誤應該使用某種符號，如某字錯了，便以「×」表示，某字漏排了，便在那字應佔的地方加一「∧」號，多了某字，便以「○」抹去，而於「○」之下拖一長尾，並作螺旋形。要各種錯誤有各種不同的一定符號表示，方免得混淆。再者，加添上去的字——如錯字被「×」而另加之字——切不可注在錯字之旁，這不但會弄得不明，而且又引出紛亂來，必定要在該字所佔之一行的「書邊」或「書眉」——視「直排」或「橫排」而定——上很淸楚地錄出。如果該行已有錯字，或錯到數字，則依順次照退錄，前後分淸，以免將此正字代替了他一正字之混亂，又重生錯誤。此外，還有字句前後之顚倒和某一字之倒置可橫置，都應於該一字或數字之下或旁邊，注一表示其錯誤之符號，頂好再於書邊將已改正之字順序錄下，用一括弧括着，令其注意。</p>
<p>校對最易忽略而又最易錯誤的是西文字和數目字。因為中國的排字工人外國文程度很淺，首先是易把大寫小寫弄錯，其次是易將「l」排成「e」，將「a」排成「o」，「n」排成「u」等，因這些字在草書上是差不多的。在校外國文時，不怕你就認識某字而又能拚出，如果你還有點不自信的話，那頂好還是去按對原稿——自然，這對於那些專排印西文而又對西文有素養的排字工人和校對者又當別論。數目字在書上的關係很大，如錯了一位弄得全意都錯誤時也有。校對起來，除一字一字去對原稿外無他法。因為這並不是文句，可以由意義來校訂其正誤的。</p>
<p>還有許多地方得留心的。在從這一頁渡到另一頁時，你務要特別小心，錯誤多半是發生在交界的處所。頂好是將全文或全書在末尾通校一次，校正在每次「送校」的過渡地方的遺誤。在未「上紙版」之先，要把各種應做的手續做到，免得在紙版上來改版。在已經印好而未裝釘之先，應將全書淸理一下，免得有前後錯釘和篇頁倒置之弊。</p>

<h3>毒氣防禦與中毒急救</h3>
<p>— 遛</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰後的創痕尚未恢復，而和平神龕上已經滿是鳥屎蟲糞，甚至有幾個野心家想一脚把和平神像踢倒。現在黑雲正密佈在天空。西方，意阿　戰已開戰爭的序幕，希特勒雙手撕毀羅卡諾公約，悍然進兵萊茵不駐兵區；東方，俄「滿」邊境　起戰　，這些都是山雨欲來的先兆。加以國際間因失了海軍條約的拘束，各自競修武備，各國的國防預算無不極度膨脹至無可再膨脹，某國藏相且因不忍竭澤而漁之故慘遭殺戮，其事態之嚴重可知。</p>
<p>以前，國人競以「一九三六之危機」惴惴於心，不圖事態之　展，其速率竟有超乎預想之外者。未來的第二次世界大屠殺何時正式揭幕，固非吾人所能預料，惟環觀國際形勢，戰機之一觸即發，殆無疑義。又這次大屠殺將於何處發動，雖亦非吾人所能預測，惟吾人亦可肯定地球上無論何處均埋伏著大戰的火藥，隨處均有着火之可能，並且更可肯定不論東西那一方先開始戰爭，其另一方亦必隨之發動。至於中國在大戰時當居於如何地樣，凡稍稍明瞭國際現狀　　　　之。而中國的一塊肥　蓋亦為環伺著的列强所垂涎不止者。</p>
<p>一切戰爭的方法，古代用刀矛，近世用槍砲，雖所用的利器不同，而均不外摧殘敵人的體格，使失其戰鬥力，蓋時無古今中外，目的則一也。當兩個勢均力敵的國家，不幸戰事發生，雙方均希望於最短期內判決勝負，然為事實上所不可能，於是勾心鬥角，用盡方法，　以時間充足，得措置裕如，挖掘壕溝則愈掘愈深，工事建築則愈建愈固，幾變陣地戰為要　戰矣。如以科學進步，鋼板的發明，分散的部隊的新戰術，不特刀矛失其作用，即火器之效力亦因以减小，在此情況之下，戰爭的殺人的利器與方法自有積極改進之必要，即捨却直綫飛行的砲彈，而採用一種子彈，能曲綫各種障礙物，而傷敵人於遮蔽之中是　。此種理想中之子彈必須無窮的微小，且能飄浮於空氣內，並具有特性，一與敵人的軀體接觸，生活作用上即被其破壞，無繼續作戰之能力，此項子彈，即毒氣的分子，亦即化學戰所緣起也。當第一次世界大戰時，始成立此種名詞，那時各國所用的毒氣，已多至五十餘種，近且不知又發明幾許矣！據斯以觀，本來的大戰，無疑的是化學戰，豈不　可長　？所</p>

<p>以。處在這個非常時代的我們。關於防毒的知識，防毒的方法，不能不作相當的研究。</p>
<p>茲將關於防毒的重要各點介紹如下：</p>
<p>一·個人的毒氣防禦</p>
<p>個人的防毒方法可分兩種：第一是呼吸機關的防毒，用獨立面具及濾過器面具。第二是皮膚及身體的防毒。第一種所用的獨立防毒面具，如帶上養氣面具，可與外部的空氣隔絕，呼吸所需的養氣由器中攜帶的養氣供給，可支持一時至二時之久；又如帶了軟管面具，可由軟管中吸收不受毒之新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>二·民衆防毒</p>
<p>民衆防毒須有好的防毒組織，防毒組織須於平時詳細規劃，預爲準備，否則一旦發生毒氣戰爭，必且束手待斃，所以這個問題在現在最值得我們注意。</p>
<p>近來世界各國爲督促民衆注意防毒起見，均大聲疾呼促人人各備一面具，但後方的民衆須人人各備面具，在事實上實不可能。所以只能採用集團防毒。</p>
<p>集團防毒是將多數人民容納在有防毒設備的場所，所以集團防毒是一個建築問題。當預爲籌備的。</p>
<p>照法國建築章程，凡欲建造影戲院者，都須有一防毒間，方可發給建築證書，以便將來收容難民之用。</p>
<p>三·中毒急救</p>
<p>在未受毒侵襲以前，自以採用防毒的方法爲宜，如或已被中毒，將如何救治，亦一重要問題，茲特介紹其要點如左：　救護時先運送中毒人離開毒區，以便中毒人吸新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>宜以救生床運送，不可步行，距離不可過遠。</p>
<p>運送時宜使空氣流通。</p>
<p>應注意毒氣有潛伏期者。故元論輕毒重毒，均須鄭重年護。</p>
<p>使中毒人舒適躺臥，解開一切衣服，而覆以溫暖的毛　或被褥。</p>
<p>中毒人的衣服宜分別放置。</p>
<p>如呼吸停止，且確知爲血毒，神經毒，窒息毒，宜行人工呼吸法。</p>
<p>如爲皮膚毒（芥子氣，魯憲斯氣），須換凈衣，通體皮膚上宜撤撒　化石炭粉，然後洗去。（勿入眼中，否則盲目）</p>
<p>如爲刺激毒，糜爛毒，不可行人工呼吸。</p>
<p>一切中毒者均可與以養氣，但不可以壓力迫入。</p>
<p>四·消毒</p>
<p>發生毒氣　爭的時候，無論在有方或後方，都應組織消毒隊，專司一切消毒工作。</p>
<p>市，用水沖洗，並以　化石炭數佈，每平方約三百格蘭　，工作過後二三小時，所有的芥子毒均消滅。樹木，可用化學粉噴射之，過後二三小時再用水沖洗。被炸彈或砲彈轟擊的有彈痕之處，應撤以　化石炭，然後塡平，其分量爲每十平方的彈痕約需一啟羅格蘭母　化石炭，彈痕若大，依此類推。木料用水沖洗，再撒以　化石炭，更以酒精搓之。服裝襯衫，先在蘇打溶液中洗滌，再入鍋煮之，此時宜注意有毒的水蒸氣。室人墻壁，先用水洗凈，再塗上　化石炭漿，過了二十四小時再用水沖洗，並使空氣流通。</p>
<p>除了上述各種外，關於食物及飲料的消毒尤關重要。食物中毒後，務必立即拋棄或消毀之，切不可因愛惜食物而害及生命，貧窮人對這一點尤須注意。至於水，在充飲料之前，至少須煮半小時，然後考查確定。水中有沒有含著化學戰鬥材料的痕跡，如有時，雖煮沸也不能入口，尤其是砒霜，即在煮沸後其互性亦不減的。</p>
<p>消毒藥呂最好而價又最便宜的，是　化石炭，已如上述。若時間一長，結成堆塊，便不能作散布之用了。現在有一種叫做Lausantin的，也是　化石炭質，則雖經數年之久，亦能保持其散布性。</p>
<p>綜上所述，因限於是篇幅，不能盡量詳細介紹，所以僅具綱領而已。茲爲便利願意研究這問題的同胞起見，就筆者所知，介紹專書二種如下：一，吳沆編的「化學戰爭」（間務版）；二，「防毒常識」（中華版）</p>
<h3>兒童電影的傾向</h3>
<p>— 經執</p>
<p>中國的兒童敎育向來很落後；最近雖有「救救孩子」的呼聲，雖有兒童文學的提倡，但無論在哪一方面都還沒有偉大的成績表現出來。不說別的，就是有普遍的敎育意義的電影，在國產片中幾乎找不到一部好的兒童影片。因此，對於中國一般兒童的心理測騐幾乎不可能。但歐美的情形卻不同，它們一般文化水準比我們高，兒童敎育也比我們普及，因之關於兒童的電影也很發達。在那里的兒童電影的一般傾向上，我們可以看出世界一般兒童心理乃至一般社會心理的傾向，因爲兒童心理可說是社會心理之純潔的反映。</p>
<p>據國際聯盟少年文化委員會所發表，最近世界兒童所愛好的電影，主要的是探險的，喜劇的，神秘的，浪漫的片子；在這中間，英，美，法，意等國的兒童，特別是小姑娘們，尤其愛好浪漫喜劇；至于戰爭的，敎育的電影，那已經成爲過去時代的了。這個事實所表現出的歐美兒童心理的傾向：第一是厭恨和反對殘酷的戰爭，這種心理不消說是世界的一般反戰心理的反映；第二是在冒險，滑稽，神秘，戀愛浪漫的藝術中去找刺激和愉快，這也可說是在這大時代的前夜中，一部份煩惱，苦悶的社會的心理的表現。</p>
<h3>美國大學的景氣</h3>
<p>— 古</p>
<p>據最近的統計，去年末美國四十四州的大學及專門學樣的學生數目，比較前年的增加了八·三％；特別是太平洋方面的大學，竟增加了一〇％。對於這件事情，無厲不　證明好景氣的美國政府，也明白宣稱這樣的大學生人數的增加是好景氣的證據。然而，所謂大學生，大都是富家的子弟；如果美國大學生人數之增加眞可證明該國的好景氣的話，那這樣的好景氣的出現也不過是美國富人們的更富這個其實之說明而已！</p>

<h3>二簧戲研究</h3>
<p>— 作舟</p>
<p>我們在街頭巷尾都可以聽得「：自思自　，想起了當年事好不　然：」這樣的歌詞。在播臺上，在留聲機裏，在戲院，我們都聽見二簧戲的唱做。有許多人的娛樂都消磨在這裏面，在許多人的歷史知識也斷斷續續地從二簧戲中得來，而一般中小市民的這種思想有許多也來自這戲劇。所以　有值得研究的價值。</p>
<p>原來二簧戲是一種平民的野生藝術。二進年來，漸次將崑曲的地盤取而代之了。因爲崑曲的詞句雖然華麗，腔調雖然雅訓，但一般平民是沒有餘暇去學習，而且也沒有那樣的程度去領略的。崑曲詞句不能通俗，一字與一字之間小腔太多，字爲腔所裹，格外不容易聽懂。而二簧則詞語即然通俗，而行腔又在每句之後，所以易於是理會。崑腔聲音太低，只宜於少數私家演唱，不能普及大衆。而且　音的班笛，其聲太細，所以嗓子非降低去適合牠不可。而二簧則恰與此相反。崑曲咬字太過，而且南曲行，以吳音爲主不易通行，而二簧則平正通達，近於語言，且屬流行官話。崑曲雖以溫和優雅見長，但是不如二簧之慷慨抑揚，悲壯痛快，所以易於使人感到沉悶。因這種種理由，二簧便無形中奪取了崑腔的地盤。</p>
<p>二簧在初期不過是民間的一種牧歌式的歌唱，經了許多的修改，才變成現在這樣的形式。最初源於湖北，而湖北又以黃陂和黃岡兩地爲中心。其次由湖北一方面傳至湖南，廣西，廣東，另一方面傳到安徽。總名之曰湖廣調。二簧最初只是二簧，後來受了徽調和秦腔的影響，才有所調二簧西皮的對稱。二簧腔因爲受了各種腔調的影響，融會貫通，漸漸由湖經人改　成現在的形式，複從湖北傳到安徽，再由安徽人傳至北京，便變成了京二簧。二簧戲中的腔調不祇一種。無論崑，戈（江西戈陽腔），秦腔，都兼收並　（自然一切牌子都出自崑腔）。往往在一　戲裏滲入許多別的腔調。凡是一種民間的藝術的進化發展，都是要經過這樣的過程的。</p>
<p>二簧戲的長處是平易簡單，但是牠的缺瞇也正因爲牠太簡單了。因爲在表情上，腔調太簡單了，聲音不符情節，大足以使所表演之戲劇的力量減色。所以有許多名　，因爲牠太不夠用，每每就字音的高低陰陽造出些牠牠短短的新腔，求能在輕　疾徐之間　救這些缺陷。同時更不能不求助於崑，戈，秦諸腔，就是大鼓小曲之類直掃間接也不能不有所借用。但是因爲這樣的雜揉，生吞活剝，不能消化，所以到了現在二簧變成了雜會，已非本來面目了。在這進化的過程中，二簧本身雖已豐富起來，但是幾經戲子改削，隨口亂唱，往往超出了二簧原板西皮數板的範圍，弄得聲音短促，組織淺陋，好像背誦賬簿，這完全是糟蹋了二簧戲原有的美點。所以現</p>

Whether Commander Tada and Chief of Staff Nagami will remain in office or be transferred back to their country is related to the expansion of the military and will be announced at the same time before we know. 3. The Japanese military headquarters has not built airfields in Baoding, Jinghai, or Tongxian, nor has it made such requests. 4.

<h3>Reading the 24th Year Report of the Bank of China's Entry</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Hoping the Bank of China will soon complete its mission as an international exchange bank.</p>
<p>Since various countries engaged in currency wars, China has been increasingly affected, reaching a serious level in the past two years. Industries and businesses failed, rural areas went bankrupt, and the financial industry also faced repeated crises. It was difficult to save ourselves from the surging tides. Amidst these turbulent waves, the Bank of China maintained and coped with the situation effectively, preventing the market from collapsing. The results of the entire year's operations in the 24th year also showed much progress. Since the establishment of the savings department on June 1st, savings reached over 43 million yuan in half a year, and the amount of banknote issuance increased by over 80 million yuan, totaling 286.24 million yuan. How could such excellent results be achieved without strong credit?</p>
<p>Since the government increased official shares for the sake of consolidating the banking system, the Bank of China has increased its capital from 25 million yuan to 40 million yuan. The business policy has also been determined: "Special attention is paid to the adjustment of foreign trade and the business of international exchange banks in recent years." In other words, it aims to fulfill its mission as an international exchange bank. The purpose of last year's currency reform was also related to this point. According to the Bank of China's report, "Our country's currency value can be restored to the average price of the five years before the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and prices will rise accordingly, coupled with a sharp increase in export trade, which is sufficient to improve the path of international balance of payments. This is especially hopeful." Now, let's examine foreign trade and international balance of payments.</p>
<p>In January of this year, China's foreign trade once saw a surplus unprecedented in sixty years, but it was like a flash in the pan, and February still showed a deficit. Regardless of the ups and downs, let's look at the Bank of China's estimated balance of payments. Imports declared at customs were 919.2 million yuan, and smuggled imports were 21 million yuan (smuggling in North and South China this year may be more than this number). The total is 1,129.2 million yuan. The value of exports declared at customs was 575.8 million yuan, and the underestimated value (calculated at 15%) was 86.4 million yuan, totaling 662.2 million yuan. After deducting imports and exports, the deficit should be 467 million yuan, far exceeding the 343 million yuan recorded in the customs register. In addition, most of China's exports are not crafts but raw materials of animals, plants, and minerals. There is not much mineral development, and animals and plants are all crops of farmers. Speaking of Chinese farmers, most are small farmers with weak strength and fragmented land. Without thorough reform and reorganization, there is no hope of large-scale production. Therefore, it is not easy to have large exports to compete overseas. This is the first point. Agricultural production also requires considerable capital. After rural bankruptcy, where does farmers' capital come from? Even if there are bank loans, how can they actually reach the hands of farmers? In recent years, the Bank of China has been quite active in lending to agriculture. The year-end balance last year was 25.16 million yuan, an increase of 19.98% compared to the previous year. However, loans to small farmers were only 510,000 yuan, accounting for only 2%. In addition, loans to rural cooperatives totaled 4.49 million yuan, more than double the previous year. However, the number of cooperatives that obtained loans (2,814) compared to the number of registered cooperatives nationwide (26,224) is only a little more than one-tenth. It is not easy for farmers to obtain funds. As a result, it either still comes from high-interest loans or there is no hope of increasing or improving their production. This is the second point. The development of export trade depends on the joint efforts of all parties. Although the quantity of imports has decreased due to the inability of the Chinese people to purchase, they still come in continuously. As such, it is difficult to seek a balance of international payments. If the exchange rate changes due to an imbalance in payments, foreign trade will inevitably be affected. This is the third point.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the international balance of payments will not change and that the situation can be spared from turmoil due to the lack of drastic changes in silver prices. It is hoped that foreign exchange can still be maintained without collapse. Regarding foreign exchange, at the beginning of the currency reform, the three banks set up a foreign currency reserve of 32.5 million US dollars (converted from 50 million ounces of silver at 65 cents per ounce) "to stabilize foreign exchange at the standard exchange rate when the new currency policy is implemented." Now, the standard exchange rate is one yuan of legal tender to one shilling and two and a half pence. Whether there will be changes in the future is our most concerned issue. This is also discussed in the Bank of China's report. According to the report, "The government has no intention of fixing the national currency to any foreign legal currency. However, it may be inevitable to weigh and handle this matter in the future. Since the major foreign currencies are relatively stable at present, this issue is quite important in theory."</p>
<p>Moreover, if China wants to develop overseas trade, financial institutions and shipping industries should also be planned and taken care of. The Dutch East Indies was originally successfully operated by Chinese overseas, but due to the lack of banking and shipping facilities, a good market was allowed to be invaded by others. Since the Bank of China wants to fulfill its mission as an international exchange bank and has already established a management office in London, a branch in Osaka, and will establish a branch in Singapore and a management office in New York, it is deeply hoped that it will gradually expand overseas financial institutions and further promote them to benefit China's foreign trade development.</p>
<p>Although industry and commerce have not been revitalized, the development of foreign trade is also difficult to achieve. In recent years, the failure of industry and commerce has been due to many factors, and the general financial industry's fear of lending to industry and commerce is also a fatal injury. However, the Bank of China increased its lending to industry and commerce last year. General commercial loans increased by 17%, industrial loans increased by 10.88%, and transportation loans increased by 18.24%. The report also stated, "The bank should guide factories and enterprises to make their organization sounder and help them grow. It is originally incumbent on them, but unfortunately, to this day, at most, only short-term loans are given." This is indeed a valuable argument. If other banks all take the Bank of China's intentions as their own, the revival of industry and commerce can be expected.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Regularly Conducts Peace Talks; Italian Air Force Threatens Albanian Capital; Five Aircraft Bomb the Albanian Capital; Old Soldiers Fire Old-fashioned Guns into the Air</h3>
<p>Tirana – Five Italian aircraft flew into this city this morning, circling in the sky several times. Then, two aircraft separated from the remaining three and flew to a height of sixty feet above the ground, using machine guns to strafe the airfield, destroying one old aircraft, but no one was killed. The radio station was also not touched. After the aircraft appeared in the sky, old soldiers who participated in the Battle of Adwa in 1890 fired old-fashioned rifles into the air from high places all over the city. Bullets flew around, harming residents more than the enemy aircraft. Foreigners heard the rattling of the aircraft and rushed to their respective embassies. The cellars and trenches in the embassies were immediately filled with people. The police acted admirably, dividing themselves and heading to designated stations to prevent thugs from taking advantage of the residents' commotion to engage in looting. The two aircraft hovered over the city and the surrounding villages for about an hour before flying away, apparently not hit. The Albanian queen immediately went with foreign envoys by car to Alaki to inspect the damage. When the queen returned to the palace, she was warmly cheered by the people. Soon after, the cabinet met to consider plans to continue protecting residents, as they expected enemy aircraft to bomb again sooner or later. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tirana – Five Italian reconnaissance aircraft flew into this city this morning, circling several times before flying away. At about ten o'clock, a team of Italian bombers appeared in the sky above the city, dropping countless heavy explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The Albanian army's anti-aircraft artillery immediately retaliated with intensive firepower, but without apparent effect. The aircraft team did not leave until nearly noon. The extent of the damage is still under investigation. It is reported that two aircraft hangars were hit and caught fire, and one of the Albanian king's official aircraft was burned.

<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen, Madariaga, contacted the governments of Italy and Albania yesterday in accordance with the resolution passed by the Committee on March 23 regarding the peace talks issue. It has now been decided to convene the Committee on the 8th of this month to report on the progress and the situation of contacting Italy. At that time, the Committee of Thirteen will also assign Madariaga a practical task to continue negotiations with Italy and Albania. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen has now scheduled a meeting for the 8th of this month. League of Nations officials believe that convening the meeting before Chairman Madariaga continues to contact Italy and Albania shows that these contacts are still within the scope of the League of Nations. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Committee of Thirteen; Italy to Send Representatives; Chairman to Report on Peace Talks Progress</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen, Madariaga, previously invited the Italian government to directly discuss the issue of peace talks between Italy and Albania with the Committee. The Italian government replied in accordance, stating that the Italian government was prepared to send representatives to attend the Committee's meeting around April 20, after Easter. The Permanent Secretary of the Italian Delegation to the League of Nations, Scialoja, recently submitted a copy of this letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, for record. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen is scheduled to meet on the 8th of this month to hear Chairman Madariaga's report on the progress of peace talks with representatives from Italy and Albania. According to information obtained by this agency's reporter, the report will consist of two points: 1) Explaining that the only achievement since accepting the commission to contact Italy and Albania is that the Italian government has agreed to send representatives to attend the Committee after Easter; 2) Madariaga asked the Italian government about the use of poison gas by its troops in Albania, but Italy has not yet responded. In addition to listening to Madariaga's report, the Committee of Thirteen will also decide on the attitude to be adopted in the future. As for the League of Nations Assembly's Committee of Eighteen, which discusses the issue of sanctions against Italy, the Committee of Thirteen will also consider what attitude it should adopt in the future. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly's Committee of Eighteen, which is specifically tasked with discussing sanctions against Italy, has been notified by its chairman, Vasconcelos (Portuguese representative), to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, that the Chairman of the Council's Committee of Thirteen, Madariaga, is currently making efforts to mediate in order to promote peace talks between Italy and Albania. Therefore, the Committee of Eighteen does not intend to convene a meeting at this time. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden met with the Italian Ambassador Grandi this afternoon for discussions. Grandi also held talks with Foreign Office officials at the Quai d'Orsay. It is generally understood that the Italian Ambassador assured Eden and Vansittart that Italy would not interfere with British interests in the Lake Tana region of Abyssinia after Italian troops occupied it. Foreign Secretary Eden also met with Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu this afternoon. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Locarno Conference; Britain Advocates Delay; France's Request Thwarted</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden has rejected France's proposal that the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, namely Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, hold a meeting in Paris or Brussels on Wednesday, as it is inappropriate and unnecessary for a meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty to be held simultaneously with the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen in Geneva on Wednesday. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures recently stated that the League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen is scheduled to meet in Geneva on the 8th of this month to discuss the issue of peace talks between Italy and Albania. At that time, French Foreign Minister Flandin, Belgian Prime Minister Janson, and British Foreign Secretary Eden can take the opportunity to discuss the German memorandum and its possible consequences. There is no need to convene a second Locarno Conference. The Foreign Office has notified the French and Belgian governments of this intention. It is generally believed that the countries concerned are continuing to discuss the date and location of the second Locarno Conference. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The political circles here have given a good appraisal of the French proposal that the second Locarno Conference be held in Brussels on the 8th of this month, believing that the French government will definitely put forward a "constructive plan within the scope of the League of Nations" at that time. As for France's original attitude towards the German abrogation of the treaty, it was acting "in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Locarno Treaty" without going through the League of Nations, which was criticized by various parties. Now that France has put forward a new plan, this criticism no longer exists, and Britain and France have reached a consensus on the procedures to be adopted in the future. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The attention of all sectors here is now focused on the convening of the conference of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty. According to the French government's proposal, the talks should be held in Paris or Brussels no later than next week. Foreign Minister Flandin may deliver a very important speech at this meeting, analyzing and commenting in detail on the various peace plans proposed by the German government, or even putting forward a corresponding counter-proposal, which is unknown. If this counter-proposal is put forward, it is believed that it will have the nature of reconciling the demands of the Locarno Treaty countries on March 11 and the peace plans currently proposed by the German government. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) It was recently learned from reliable sources that the Italian government does not seem to oppose the French proposal to convene a conference of the Locarno Treaty countries within the next week. Negotiations on this issue have been underway for some time. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>London Observers: European Situation Temporarily Calmed; Poland Demands Explanation</h3>
<p>(London) Political circles expect a quiet end to the week. Foreign Secretary Eden's assurance in the House of Commons today, stating that the talks between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium do not increase Britain's political obligations, is widely believed to be reassuring. Prime Minister Baldwin has gone to Chequers, but Eden remains at the Foreign Office tonight. Among those who visited him today was Italian Ambassador Grandi. It is reported that Grandi again assured Eden that Italy is willing to respect the entire and complete treaty rights of Britain in Abyssinia. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters correspondent in Berlin, German political circles do not want to criticize Eden's remarks. Well-informed circles expressed disappointment that Eden insisted on conducting talks between general staffs when Germany was making a new constructive gesture to lay the foundation for peace. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw – The Polish Ambassador to Germany, Lipski, has been ordered to call on the German Foreign Minister, Neurath, to discuss the German memorandum. It is generally believed that the Polish government believes that the German peace plan is very detailed for Western European countries but omits Eastern European countries, which is somewhat discriminatory. Therefore, it has ordered the Ambassador to Germany to request an explanation from the German government. At this time, the responsible parties in Poland have not yet stated their attitude towards the German memorandum. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>Brazilian Capital – The Hindenburg airship has now arrived safely here, flying 6,875 miles in 100 hours. It was warmly welcomed by the crowd upon landing. Representatives from the Brazilian government and the German Embassy were present to welcome it. The ship will fly back to Germany tomorrow. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Brazilian Capital – A Reuters correspondent sent a wireless message from the world's largest airship, the Hindenburg, stating that the aeronautical hotel departed from Lake Constance in Germany for its maiden voyage to the Brazilian capital. The journey was smooth, and it is now slowly flying over Brazil. It is expected to arrive in Rio de Janeiro this morning. Dr. Eckener, the captain of the airship, expressed surprise and annoyance after hearing the news that the Nazi authorities disliked him because he refused to nationalize the Zeppelin aircraft factory and refused to be a Nazi propagandist. He considers himself a non-politician. His greatest interest in life is airships, but he is a true supporter of Nazism. He voted in favor of the Nazi Party, and he is confident that he can live peacefully in Germany. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Mrs. Mollison Flies Over the Sahara Desert</h3>
<p>Fuselage Damaged in Darkness; Forced to Stop</p>
<p>Colomb-Béchar – After Mrs. Mollison flew into this city last night, she soon resumed her journey over the Sahara Desert towards Niamey. Unexpectedly, the lower part of her aircraft was damaged in the darkness. Mrs. Mollison told a Reuters reporter that she would continue to Cape Town, but she could not say for sure that she would make it. Last night, it was too dark to examine the extent of the damage in detail, so she decided that she could repair it locally. The weather was very cold during yesterday's flight, and there was a sharp wind. She arrived here later than expected, but the aircraft performed very well. According to reports, Mrs. Mollison flew from Gravesend Airfield to this city in ten hours and fifteen minutes, a distance of 1,550 miles, which is the first stop. Although she encountered setbacks on this trip, her ambition is admirable. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Memorandum: France Drafts Counterproposal</h3>
<p>Prepared to be submitted to the League of Nations for discussion</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, sources with responsibility disclosed that France is willing to discuss a plan to consolidate peace in Europe, and will propose this plan as a response to the suggestions made by Germany. France will completely reject the German suggestions, but will propose another basis for negotiation, so that Britain and other signatories of the Locarno Pact, as well as Germany, can continue negotiations. To demonstrate its sincerity, France will engage in negotiations with Germany through its ambassador to Germany, Ponsot. Ponsot is currently meeting with the French ambassadors to Britain and Italy, along with Premier Sarraut and Foreign Minister Flandin, to discuss drafting France's response to Germany, in preparation for submitting it to the Cabinet for review on Monday. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) France intends to submit the German peace plan to the Council of the League of Nations for review. If a counterproposal is presented, it will also be submitted to the Council for study. According to reliable sources, Foreign Secretary Eden, after meeting with French Ambassador Corbin and Belgian Ambassador Max, has already approved this French approach. Well-informed sources in the British capital believe that the German peace plan not only concerns the signatories of the Locarno Pact, but also involves other European member states of the League of Nations. It is deemed more appropriate to have it discussed by the Council, rather than just continuing talks among the signatories of the Locarno Pact. Officials in the Foreign Office also stated that if France can take the lead in handling the entire European peace-building plan within the scope of the League of Nations, British public opinion will unanimously support it. Not only will the responsibilities of the British government be reduced, but the impact of the German propaganda campaign on British public opinion will also be terminated. Moreover, after the German peace plan is participated in by the League of Nations, the proposed non-aggression pact can be transformed into a mutual assistance agreement in accordance with the collective security system, which would have no disadvantages. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French ambassadors to Britain, Corbin, to Belgium, Laroche, to Germany, Ponsot, and to Italy, Chambrun, have been summoned back to the country by Foreign Minister Flandin. They held a meeting at the Foreign Ministry at 3:30 PM to discuss the situation created by the German memorandum. The meeting ended at 6:40 PM. In addition to the Foreign Minister and the ambassadors, Premier Sarraut, Minister without Portfolio Penancier, Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry Léger, Director of the Political Affairs Department Bargeton, Assistant Director Massigli, and the Foreign Minister's Confidential Secretary Rochat also attended. After the meeting, the official statement was that the government insisted that the two-party meeting of the Locarno Pact signatories must be convened in the middle of next week. According to inquiries from our correspondent at the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Flandin intends to propose a counterproposal to the German memorandum. He is currently leading his subordinates in the Foreign Ministry to draft it, and is very busy. He intends to submit this counterproposal, along with the German memorandum, to the Council of the League of Nations for review. The peace plan contained in the German memorandum not only concerns the signatories of the Locarno Pact, but also involves other member states of the League of Nations, so it should be handled by the Council. The Cabinet will hold a meeting on Monday next week to decide on this matter. However, regardless, the Council of the League of Nations can only discuss this matter after the French legislative elections (starting on the 26th of this month). At this moment, the Foreign Minister has firmly requested the British and Belgian governments to convene the Locarno two-party meeting as soon as possible, so as to jointly study the German memorandum. The meeting place can be in Paris or Brussels, Belgium, without restriction. As for the "temporary system" contained in the draft Locarno Agreement (i.e., the area east of the Franco-Belgian border, 20 kilometers wide, is designated as a temporary demilitarized zone, and during the negotiation period, Germany will not build defensive fortifications in the Rhineland region), since Germany has refused to accept it, what steps should be taken by the signatories of the Locarno Pact will also be discussed at the meeting. Italy has decided to send a representative to attend this meeting, and this has been guaranteed to Flandin by the Italian government. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Flandin and his colleagues are currently rushing to draft the French government's opinion and counterproposal to the German memorandum. The work is extremely busy, so that it can be submitted in time for discussion at the Locarno Pact countries' meeting proposed by the French government within the next week. According to disclosures from well-informed sources, the opinion and counterproposal will also contain two major parts. The second part will cite various facts and theories, declaring the rejection of the discussion of the legal points related to the first part of the German memorandum. The second part will propose the French government's various proposals for building peace in Europe in a concrete way, for the reference and discussion of the signatories of the Locarno Pact. The nature of this proposal seems to be more moderate than that stipulated in the memorandum of March 11, in order to mediate the German government's peace plan, because the French authorities do not want to bear the responsibility of blocking the path of negotiation. (4th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although the government authorities are temporarily keeping silent and have not made any statement on the two types of letters exchanged between Britain and France regarding the four-nation draft agreement, the semi-official newspaper "German Foreign Policy Communications" published an article today, strongly criticizing it. Between the lines, it seems to express deep regret for the actions of the British and French authorities. The article first expounds the nature of the exchange of letters, one relating to the talks between the general staff of the four Locarno Pact countries, and the other relating to the guarantees provided by the British government to the French government. It then claims that the actions of Britain and France, taken after Germany presented its new specific peace plan, are an unfriendly show of threat. Germany has solemnly stated that if the negotiating countries of the Locarno Pact first draft any one-sided agreement, or first have any unfair tacit understanding, the result will only make the solution of the situation more difficult. The German government has repeatedly resolved to work for peace with a friendly attitude and sincere expression. Since it has never had any preparation or any ambition to infringe upon the interests of other countries, the so-called talks of the general staff and the so-called pre-planning of defense strategies are all self-disturbing and unnecessary. Even if the British government believes that it cannot shirk its guarantee obligations under the Locarno Pact, why must it be so keen on military consultations? It is really unfathomable and increases the anxiety about the current situation. The indignation of all sectors of German society on this issue can be seen from this article.

<p>The Little Entente countries will file a protest</p>
<p>Prague, Czechoslovakia. Premier Hodza recently commented on the issue of Austria's adoption of the Labor and Military Service Law, saying, "Austria's resumption of conscription should be regarded as a violation of treaties. All countries willing to safeguard peace and maintain treaties should protest. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania may protest simultaneously or jointly, but Czechoslovakia does not want to act alone. The current international situation can be summarized in one sentence: the Locarno Pact is dead. It is hoped that the New Locarno Pact can last long." As for the collective security system, it is the goal of all peace plans. If Germany can participate in the future, it can be completed. In addition, the meeting held by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Rome last month did not block the door to negotiations on the future economic organization of Central Europe. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Responsible officials recently declared that the Little Entente countries may jointly protest against the Labor and Military Service Law used by Austria, but will not issue mobilization orders to threaten each other. In addition, they will reissue a statement on the inviolability of existing treaties, and require the Austrian authorities to clearly explain the purpose of the Labor and Military Service Law. According to the foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries, namely Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, at a meeting held in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia in January last year, a resolution was passed stating that each country should reject the revision of existing treaties in Central and Southwestern Europe by all means. Responsible officials here also said that since Germany abolished the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles in March last year, Austria has a precedent to follow. Moreover, Austria's actions are not only to protect its own independence, but also to maintain peace in Europe. (4th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Heavy Rains in Abyssinia: Italian Army Encounters Difficulties</h3>
<p>Future battles will be approached with caution</p>
<p>Asmara. A special dispatch from our correspondent states that after the Italian army captured the city of Gondar on the northern route in Abyssinia, it is currently continuing its activities in the area around Lake Ascianghi. However, the terrain there is rugged and difficult to navigate, without the benefit of transportation, and heavy rains are pouring down, with mud reaching ankle-deep. Therefore, progress is extremely slow, and it is necessary to proceed cautiously and gradually. As for the battle of Lake Ascianghi on the 31st of last month, that is, the battle in which the Abyssinian emperor's guards were defeated, the two armies fought fiercely in a strong wind. Although the Abyssinian army made great efforts to clash, the Italian main army calmly confronted them and remained steadfast. However, the Abyssinian soldiers who launched attacks on the Italian Askaris achieved small victories at one point. This was because the Askaris in the native army are fickle by nature and cannot calmly respond to the battle, so they were slightly defeated. Later, Italian officers took command, strictly supervised the battle, and immediately counterattacked, finally leading to a complete victory. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian army in East Africa, reported today that the Italian army is currently pursuing the Abyssinian army that retreated from Lake Ascianghi on the northern route. The Third Eritrean Regiment also participated in the capture of Gondar. The southern route is currently very quiet. It is raining in the highlands. The Italian army is preparing for a decisive advance. Rainy weather has been reported from Lake Ascianghi to Magal, but the headquarters stated that it would not affect military operations. Ditches will be dug along the occupied areas before the June rainy season. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Italian army captured the city of Gondar on the northern route in Abyssinia, it has approached the British sphere of influence in the Lake Tana basin. Britain's interests there are based on the Anglo-Italian Protocol of 1925. The semi-official Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" recently published an article by journalist Gaeda, analyzing the various agreements previously concluded between Britain and Italy, saying, "This agreement has its limits. Within these limits, Italy has ample room for discussion. Britain's rights in the Lake Tana basin are limited to water conservancy, while Italy's rights are territorial." Moreover, according to the Anglo-Italian Protocol of 1925, the Italian government may, under certain conditions, allow Britain to build roads across western Abyssinia, from Lake Tana to the border of British-Egyptian Sudan. From this, it can be seen that Britain has no sovereignty in the Lake Tana area. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After Secretary of the Navy Swanson had been ill for a long time, Stanley was acting as the secretary. Today, after Stanley met with Undersecretary of State Phillips for a long time, he told reporters that the United States would start building new warships as soon as possible to replace the aging battleships. The British Admiralty has been approved for funding to build two new battleships in 1937. The United States also has the same reason to do so. Stanley did not mention whether the United States wanted to obtain a new agreement on Pacific defense projects, or whether the United States was satisfied with the end of the current status and allowed the United States, Britain, and Japan to have freedom of action in operating naval bases on their Pacific islands in the future. When Stanley made this statement, Davis, the US representative to the London Naval Conference, was present. Davis said that the new naval treaty signed in London last week did not limit the future types of battleships, but he believed that the treaty was a step forward because it had clarified the atmosphere caused by Japan's declaration to abolish the original Washington and London treaties. The United States does not want to initiate discussions on building defense projects in the Pacific. Acting Secretary of the Navy Stanley also said that the United States could build two new battleships in 1937, and thirteen new cruisers should be built within four years. Since the Washington and London agreements have both expired, and the British government has announced plans to increase the construction of battleships and cruisers, the US Navy has a greater need to increase its ships.

<h3>US Navy Department Announces Shipbuilding Plan</h3>
<p>Prioritize Building Two Battleships</p>
<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral Stanley, the US Navy's Chief of Naval Operations who attended the London Conference, recently issued an informal statement stating that although the new London Naval Treaty drafted by Britain, France, and the United States has failed to truly limit the navy, the provision for exchanging shipbuilding information can eliminate suspicions from all sides, or may further become the basis for true disarmament. After formally reporting to Secretary of State Hull on the process of attending the conference, Stanley expressed his opinion on the treaty, advocating that the United States build two new battleships to replace the old ships. Hull stated that President Roosevelt will decide whether to submit the treaty to the current Senate for approval or to hold it until the 75th Congress in January next year. US Chief Delegate Davis also said today that the previous Washington and London Naval Treaties were too restrictive, so they failed to continue to be effective. Davis also said that Britain would try to invite Soviet Russia and Germany to participate in the British, French, and US agreement. It is also learned that General Stanley will act as Secretary of the Navy during Secretary of the Navy Swanson's convalescence. (3rd National Telegram)</p>

Demand for the British pound was very strong, and at one point its price rose to 75.30. There are widespread rumors that the bank interest rate will continue to rise tomorrow.

<h3>US Aviator Lindbergh Kidnapping Case: Key Criminal Hauptmann Dies by Execution: Electrocuted Three Times in One Minute After Sitting in the Electric Chair, Dies: Never Admitted Guilt, Did Not Say a Word Before Temporary Execution</h3>
<p>Trenton. Hauptmann, the key criminal in the Lindbergh kidnapping and murder case, was executed at 8:47 PM tonight. He never admitted guilt. Forty-five people watched him enter the death chamber, but Hauptmann did not say a word. He was pale and looked haggard, but he walked to the elevator without being helped. One minute after Hauptmann sat in the electric chair, he was electrocuted three times. After that, three doctors confirmed that Hauptmann had died. Hauptmann's wife made a final effort to save her husband before the execution, personally swearing under oath that Wendell was the person who kidnapped Lindbergh's child. Wellenzin, the prosecutor in charge of the Hauptmann case, and Hoffman, the governor of New Jersey, met for half an hour, but the result was that the governor no longer had the power to extend the death penalty, so Hauptmann's life was hopeless. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Trenton. Hauptmann, who kidnapped and murdered Lindbergh's beloved son, was executed by electric chair today. The execution took place at the New Jersey State Penitentiary. The execution time was 8:30 PM tonight. The official announcement of the execution was at 8:47 PM. Hauptmann did not admit his guilt before the execution, nor did he leave any last words. He was very determined when he approached the electric chair. He did not need anyone's help and sat in the chair himself. When he arrived at the execution chamber, the surrounding atmosphere was very tense. When the chamber door was opened, Hauptmann stood in front of it for a moment, waiting for the chamber door to be fully opened so that the prison guards could walk into the chamber from the side. Hauptmann was wearing a gray shirt, exposing his chest. His pants were brown and no longer in shape. He was wearing slippers. The prison barber had just cut his hair, which was shiny. The pants on his right foot had been torn to make it easier to install the electrodes. After Hauptmann sat in the electric chair, the executioner, Ielewa, and his assistant wrapped wet wires around his body. In front of the electric chair were twelve witnesses and six reporters, listening quietly to his last words. However, Hauptmann did not make any statements. The executioner gradually walked behind the chair, opened the lock on the iron box, and placed rubber next to the electric chair, waiting for his assistant's signal. Then he flipped the switch. After a ring, Hauptmann's body curled forward. Then the current was cut off, and the maximum current was reapplied before being shut off. After a few minutes, the doctors examined the body and declared that Hauptmann was dead. (3rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>Trenton. When the news of Hauptmann's death reached his wife's ears, she lost her composure, shouting that her husband died unjustly, and said, "My faith in my husband will never waver. I not only do not feel ashamed of my husband, but also feel that he can be my husband's glory. I firmly believe that the truth of this matter will eventually come to light, and those who killed him will never have peace of mind." (3rd National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Anhui Province: Restrictions on Grain Exports, Soaring Grain Prices, Supply Falling Short of Demand, Restrictions on Transportation to Maintain Food Supply for the People</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In recent years, Anhui Province counties have experienced frequent floods and droughts, making people's livelihoods increasingly difficult. Last year, southern Anhui suffered from floods, while northern Anhui suffered from drought. The disasters have been particularly severe this spring, and grain prices have soared, causing great concern for the food supply of the people. Southern Anhui has always been a rice-producing region. In previous years, rice shortages often led to rice-snatching incidents. Afterwards, rice was purchased from other areas for subsidized relief, and the disturbances subsided. Currently, the existing rice supply is already falling short of demand. In addition, some rice merchants, disregarding the people's food supply, are purchasing large quantities of rice every day and transporting it out of the province, causing the market price to reach over ten yuan per stone. In order to maintain the food supply for the people, the provincial government has specially set limits on the amount of rice that can be transported by sailing vessels. Northern Anhui, already suffering from natural disasters, is now facing a spring famine. Rice prices are soaring daily. Taking Bengbu as an example, in the past month, the price of wheat has increased by four yuan per stone compared to before. Yingzhou huamai wheat has risen to 15.9 yuan per stone, Feihe huamai wheat to 12 yuan per stone, and soybeans to over 14 yuan per stone. The price of rice is even more shocking, with gaofan rice selling for 18 yuan per stone and second-grade rice selling for 21 yuan, almost double the price in southern Anhui. Northern Anhui is not a rice-producing area. Most of the rice consumed is transported from Jiangnan, and the sources of wheat and beans are all in the Yinghao area. Most of it is first concentrated in Bengbu City and then transshipped to other provinces. Exports have been quite active in recent days. It is reported that Fuyang, Fengxiang, and other counties, facing the severe spring famine, with refugees everywhere awaiting relief, should not allow unscrupulous merchants to transport the limited amount of grain out of the area, resulting in a food shortage for the people of Fuyang. Fuyang has already implemented a ban on grain exports, and Fengtai plans to do the same, having telegraphed the province for instructions. The Zhengyang Relief Branch believes that with Fuyang banning grain exports, neighboring towns will have difficulty receiving supplies, and the disaster victims are panicking, leading to incidents of grain snatching. They have specially telegraphed Nan Yuejun, the commissioner of Fuyang, urging him to find ways to maintain order and provide relief to the disaster victims. (April 3rd)</p>

<h3>The Social Basis of Fascism (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Joseph Barnes, Translated by Bu Ren</p>
<p>Fascism, just like Caesar, whom it fervently praises, is a quaint term. It is not only an adjective, but also a term of praise. When Italians restored ancient robes and excavated Roman streets, they wanted to find another echo of the great past glory, so they adopted this Latin term. When syndicalists and nationalists wrote about the tenets of fascism, they distorted its meaning. German National Socialists, whose language still carries some non-Aryan heretical flavor, view it with another meaning. Like fascists, Marxists also define it in various ways. Even scholars who are neither fascists nor Marxists misunderstand and misinterpret the meaning of this term.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of fascism is as chaotic as the term itself. Italy, Germany, and Austria claim to be fascist states. Some small countries in the Balkan Peninsula and along the Baltic Sea are also often called fascist states. Within any Western country, there are groups of self-confessed fascists or fascist party members. However, as fascism expands, the meaning of the word becomes more and more limited. In times of active political struggle, even simple words must undergo semantic changes that vary from place to place. When Trotsky, President Roosevelt, and young Japanese military officers are all called fascists, the term "fascism" needs to be analyzed. Before this term is applied to class movements, social foundations, or European countries different from Japan or China, it is very important to discover what its meaning is.</p>
<p>The common point of fascism shown in Italy, Germany, and Austria, where fascism has gained power, is the attitude of fascism towards the economic problems of modern capitalism. The political methods of fascism are different; Italy and Germany are completely different in their attitudes towards race or religion. Of course, both countries have strong nationalism and strive for political and economic independence. But in recent years, this has also been the general situation in non-fascist countries. Of course, both countries show a theoretical intolerance for liberal democratic politics; but they also strictly preserve the electoral system, and even use it to produce statistical evidence of majority support, although the exercise of this system is sometimes very strange and ridiculous.</p>
<p>However, we can see a significant similarity in economic policies in these two countries. Laws that oppose the separate interests of organized labor and favor the interests of big capital are a common feature of Germany and Italy. In Italy, the strong tradition of syndicalism helped to produce the theory of the corporate state; in Germany, fascism similarly demands the unity of all citizens' interests from the development of national concepts. Specifically, although the methods are slightly different, both Mussolini and Hitler have broken up the old labor organizations, banned the right to strike, and maintained the property relations that exist in their countries.</p>
<p>Under this economic policy, the political backers openly pulled by the fascists in both countries are also the same. In Germany, in Italy, and in some countries where fascism has not yet gained power, universal suffrage movements mostly point to the middle class. Countries where the petty bourgeoisie and the landless peasant class are politically linked are the most successful fascist countries. In particular, when fascism began to fight for power, and at a certain stage afterwards, fascism regarded these masses as its strong supporters.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between this economic policy that favors monopoly capitalists and the move to seek support from the lower middle class? Is the latter just a cunning deceptive trick, a political tactic to consolidate the control of powerful capitalist groups? Or is the important meaning of fascism in representing a class that is distinctly different from the class of industrial property owners and the proletariat? Whether or not the consolidation of European fascist forces and their possible expansion to other continents depends on the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>In Western countries, the separation of the middle class from the small number of industrialists who control finance and monopolize industry is not a new phenomenon. In fact, when the citizens of Western Europe gained victory from the struggle against the landed feudal aristocracy, they had to meet the challenges of these new usurpers. This has almost always been an uneven struggle. The merchant guilds composed of free and independent merchants and workers overthrew the feudal lords who claimed territorial rights in trading towns. In Western Europe, for a short period of time, these middle-class managers used the expanding commercial borders to seize power from the landlords, establish political control, and create social and cultural systems that conformed to their own imaginations.</p>
<p>However, the merchant guilds, and the bourgeois culture they produced, could not compete with the organization of limited liability companies on equal terms. When the Industrial Revolution added new forces never dreamed of to large-scale trusts, such as mechanization, mobility, and precise division of labor, the fate of middle-class liberal capitalism was decided.</p>
<p>In one sense, it died before it was born. In another sense, it has not died. Hitler's speeches before 1933 or any Western country's occupation census can prove: its masses, even if they are not developed in power, are at least developed in number. Because not only the real middle class composed of shopkeepers, merchants, and workers, but also most of the peasants, employees of commercial society, and so-called freelancers are within its scope.</p>

<h3>British Troops Enter Yunnan Border Again</h3>
<p>200 Armed Men Occupy Jingmao</p>
<p>Local Officials and People Have Protested</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: Yunnan borders Myanmar. British troops in Myanmar entered Ban Hong two years ago, forcibly building roads and mining, causing conflicts with our side. Afterwards, although both China and Britain sent personnel to jointly survey the Yunnan-Myanmar border line, the boundary line has not yet been determined. Unexpectedly, a report has been received from Lancang that on February 21st, another 200 British soldiers, accompanied by 4 machine guns and 300 pack animals, suddenly entered Yunnan territory, forcibly occupied Jingmao in the second district of Lancang County, and set up wireless electricity there, carrying out various military activities. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation, it is not easy for our people to know the truth. The situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process:</p>
<p>After the British troops occupied Jingmao, Zhang Dingxin, the head of the seventh district of Lancang County, sent a letter of inquiry to the British side. The original letter stated: "To the esteemed Mr. British Military Officer: According to reports from our district's residents, on the 21st of this month, more than 200 British armed soldiers and 300 pack animals entered and stationed in Jingmao, our county. We do not know what you have come to do. We respectfully request you to inquire about the matter. According to international practice, any military action must be signed and agreed upon by both parties in advance and notified to our government for implementation by its subordinates before entry can be permitted. Now that our people have not received a clear order, your troops have entered our territory without authorization and with impunity. Regardless of whether you have aggressive ambitions, your contempt for our national sovereignty and violation of international law are obvious. Now, our people are angry at your country's unreasonable behavior and have united to resist to the death. We are sincerely afraid that the people will misunderstand and that accidents will occur, leading to a loss of diplomatic relations. Therefore, we especially inform you, hoping that your troops will investigate and reply. This is my earnest hope. Respectfully, Zhang Dingxin, Head of the Seventh District of Lancang County, Yunnan Province, Great China."</p>
<p>After the letter was sent, the British response was to send a proclamation, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"The Joint Sino-British Yunnan-Myanmar Southern Section Boundary Survey Committee, for the purpose of issuing a proclamation: Now the governments of China and Britain have each sent members to jointly survey the Yunnan-Myanmar boundary line with neutral members. For this purpose, it is necessary to first measure the map. Therefore, the Sino-British surveyors are currently dispatched to work. The two surveying teams will never interfere with the local heads, cooks, and the people, and all the workers and materials prepared will be paid according to the price. Local heads, cooks, and the people shall not interfere with the work of the surveyors. Furthermore, they must help them so that they can complete their work quickly and safely. Local heads, cooks, and the people must not damage the marks set up by the surveying team. The surveying team is only surveying and mapping the local area, and they do not decide the boundary line between the two countries at all. Later, when the map is completed, the members of the two countries will come to investigate again. Regarding the boundary line, the people should be quiet, not be alarmed, and not be disturbed. The people's belongings can only be obtained after payment. All workers will be paid in the same way. The surveying team and their guards will never interfere with the local chieftains, cooks, and the people, or their houses, fields, or crops. This is a special announcement.</p>

<p>Suspicious Proclamation</p>
<p>The proclamation sent by the British after the head of the seventh district of Lancang County negotiated with the British side has many suspicious points. First, why did the British army enter our territory to measure without notifying our government in advance, but instead entered our territory with its military force without authorization? Second, the seals used by both parties are the same color. The British member's seal and our member's name seal are both spring flower color. The British member's title and year are listed before ours, while the use of the seal is ours above and the British below, which does not seem appropriate. The high-ranking officials of both parties probably would not do this. Third, since it is called the Joint Sino-British Yunnan-Myanmar Southern Section Boundary Survey Committee, its official documents often use the seal of the committee. Now, not only is there no seal of the committee, but also the title of the neutral member is omitted. Fourth, the British year is written as 1936 in the Western calendar, while our year is written as the 25th year of the Republic of China. The months are all written as the first month without writing the day. The word "first month" is rarely used in the Gregorian calendar. Fifth, not long ago, we received an order from the county government that the Sino-British members and neutral members had already left the household. Now, the British army claiming to be surveying and mapping came from Myanmar. Sixth, the titles of "chiefs and cooks," etc., mentioned in the British documents have long been abolished by us. We now use the titles of district, township, town, neighborhood chiefs, etc., but they do not know our internal organization at all. Seventh, the British personnel who came did not include our members and neutral members. Such a major issue is actually being measured and mapped unilaterally by the British side, and they are leading their heavy troops into the territory. Eighth, the section of land disputed by China and Britain is west of the second district of Lancang. The surveying and mapping should start from the west of the second district, but now it is not the case. The surveying section extends into the interior Kongming Mountain, obviously without waiting for the joint survey. The land belonging to our second district has already entered British Myanmar. The British side is purely using mapping as an invasion. Ninth, as soon as the British troops arrived in Jingmao, they carried out various military activities, which is definitely not something that should be done by those engaged in surveying. Based on these nine points, it can be known that the British statement is fabricated, intending to deceive our people.</p>
<p>Troop Advancement Steps</p>
<p>I recall that in the past, there was a foreign missionary of unknown origin named Yong Weili who extensively established "Salal halls" (i.e., mission churches) in the Lancang area, extensively proselytizing, using all kinds of methods to entice our people to join the church. He even used English letters to combine various ethnic dialects and compiled them into books to teach them. Many ordinary people were thus麻醉麻醉麻醉by him. He operated in the Lancang area for 30 years, establishing more than 200 "Salal halls." Almost every place where a "Salal hall" was established became a special zone, and everything was controlled by the "Salal hall" and not subject to our jurisdiction. The extent of his power can be imagined. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the local government filed a complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, requesting the British to withdraw. However, his power has already been developed, and Yong Weili's son, Yang Hailuo, is still operating in his father's footsteps, leading to the current unauthorized entry of British troops.</p>
<p>The route of the British army's advance, according to the records of the Lancang County Seventh District People's News Agency, recently learned that the British army's move into Yunnan, its key figures had secret discussions saying "This decision will survey the boundary affairs. Regarding the Ban Hong factory, the members of both sides have surveyed and negotiated near the factory. The factory is a small place, and the gains and losses are not worth worrying about. However, the land of the eighteen chieftains belonging to Lancang must achieve the goal of seizure. The current method of advancing is to gradually advance from the rear. For example, if a part is opened from Myanmar to station in Bangyang, then the Bangyang stationed troops will be stationed in Bangsang, and the Bangsang stationed troops will be stationed in Dengzhan River. One part of Dengzhan River will advance into Jingmao. Those stationed in Jingmao will advance into Kongming Mountain. If it is promoted in this way, it will directly reach Ban Hong, etc." Now, after the British army occupied Jingmao, it immediately set up a wireless electricity station there, striving for military work, and displaying goods to set up markets to lure our unruly elements, making various actions to incite and disrupt our side. Furthermore, in every place where there is a church, they subsidize the church members and station troops for defense. The places where churches have been established, the people have been baptized and have long surrendered to the church, and are driven by them.</p>
<p>Public Appeal</p>
<p>After the British troops occupied Jingmao, the people of Lancang County were extremely indignant and united to defend the territory. Various express mail telegrams have been sent in recent days, and one of them is recorded below to show a glimpse: "Extremely urgent, according to reliable reports, 'Yesterday, February 21st, more than 200 armed British soldiers, accompanied by 4 machine guns and more than 300 pack animals, entered our territory and are now stationed in Jingmao in the second district. I don’t know what their intentions are, and it is difficult to speculate. An investigation reveals that this British army entered our territory without authorization and without notifying our government in advance. They dared to rely on their military force and rampage, not only despising our national sovereignty but also violating international law. This is tolerable, what is intolerable? Now the people in the war zone lament that the country will be destroyed at any time, and they have fully armed themselves, united together, and vowed to fight a decisive battle with the British to drive this British army out of the country and will not make the slightest concession. At this critical moment of survival, we must not give up an inch of land to the enemy. If we ignore it, it will inevitably be a continuation of the Northeast. I hope that people from all walks of life will urgently unite and provide us with assistance to save the dangerous situation together. I am very eager to look forward to it!'” (March 12th)</p>
<h3>Statistics on Japanese Industrial Investments in Harbin</h3>
<p>12 Large Factories of Various Kinds</p>
<p>Investments of Over 19 Million</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Since the establishment of the puppet organization, the number of Japanese investments in Harbin's industry has gradually increased. After the illegal transaction of the Chinese Eastern Railway was successfully completed, large Japanese capitalists came to Harbin to invest more enthusiastically. The latest statistics are listed below: (unit: thousands of yuan)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Discusses Matters in Tianjin: There is No Fear of Communist Infiltration in Hebei and Chahar</h3>
<p>Negotiations on diplomatic issues are ongoing.</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, traveled by car to Dagukou at approximately 9:00 AM on the 1st to inspect the 41st Division of Liu Ruming's troops, specifically Liu Zhensan's Brigade. Simultaneously, he surveyed the construction of the Tianjin-Dagu highway. It was previously agreed upon by the Tianjin Municipal Government and the 29th Army's Liu Division to dispatch a regiment to simultaneously construct and level the dirt road from both the Tianjin and Dagu ends within twenty days to facilitate automobile traffic. The construction of sixteen cement bridges over ditches will be contracted out by the Bureau of Public Works. Once this road is completed, transportation between Tianjin and Dagu will become even more convenient, in addition to the Beining Railway and the Hai River. Song conducted the survey that day, but due to strong winds, he returned to Tianjin at approximately 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>During this visit to Tianjin, Song met with key Japanese figures for several consecutive days, engaging in extensive discussions on various matters, including communist prevention in North China and Hebei-Chahar diplomacy. At 4:00 PM on the 1st, reporters from Tianjin visited him for an interview. Song received them and spoke decisively, stating, "I will remain in Tianjin for about ten more days. I may travel outside the city within the next few days, but it will only be to inspect the garrison troops near the Tianjin suburbs, and I can return on the same day. The rumor about my trip to Shandong to meet with Han (Fuju) is not true. Regarding the communist threat in Shanxi, according to what I have heard in recent days, the Shanxi army's suppression efforts have become smoother. However, the full truth is not yet known. It is also heard that Zhu and Mao have not yet entered Shanxi. The over ten thousand rebels who are disrupting Shanxi belong to Peng Dehuai and Xu Xiangqian's factions. There is absolutely no concern about communist prevention in Hebei Province. The 29th Army currently has four divisions: one division remains to guard Chahar, two divisions are stationed to protect Tianjin and Beiping, and one division is scattered throughout southern Hebei. The training of our army has always instilled the understanding that soldiers are the people, and the people are the soldiers. Even if the communists intend to incite rebellion, I believe it will be difficult for them to succeed. Our army can unite with the people, and communist prevention can achieve cooperative results. Recently, there have been rumors that our army is expanding by one division, but this is absolutely not true. This must be a misunderstanding based on the increase in the number of security corps. In order to strengthen local self-defense forces in Hebei Province, three security corps teams are being trained. The annual expenses are over one million, which will be funded by reorganizing the existing local county ground police and adding additional donations. The duty of those in power is to alleviate the people's suffering. I went to Baoding for inspection a few days ago and learned that some counties have over forty types of surcharges. The actual land tax is one tael per mu, but the surcharges exceed several times that amount. Therefore, I ordered the abolition of thirty-six types and issued a general order to all counties in the province that future land and mu surcharges must not exceed four yuan at most. With this opportunity for the people to rest, heretical ideas will not re-enter. Shunde Pingxiang recently spread rumors that salt merchants clashed with tax police for illicitly washing salt. A regiment of troops was dispatched to suppress the unrest, and it has returned to peace. The Japanese side is particularly concerned about communist prevention in North China. Although I have met with key Japanese figures for several consecutive days, I have not made any specific statements. Hebei-East diplomacy is currently being negotiated but has no direction. The Chahar North incident was not negotiated by Special Diplomatic Envoy Luo. This is a major issue and he is definitely not responsible for it. Although I met with Matsumuro, it was only for social courtesies. He has just arrived in China and has not yet discussed anything. Japanese policy seems to be wavering and undecided. Recently, Nagami (Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Garrison) may also return to his country for instructions. There are currently around three thousand Japanese troops stationed in North China. According to the provisions, they are allowed to station eight hundred troops. It is heard that after the expansion, it will increase to over five thousand. The location of their stationed troops has not yet been disclosed to our side. This relates to the resolution of Hebei-East and our issues. If the Hebei-East puppet organization is not abolished, the new army will inevitably be stationed within the war zone, otherwise, it must be with our consent. The rampant smuggling in North China is a very serious matter. The Tianjin Customs Superintendent Lin Shize will be sent to Beijing to present a detailed report and request a relatively sound and feasible solution, because the current tariff rates are too high. One package of artificial silk originally costs one hundred and fifty yuan. If you add freight and tariffs, it will sell for three hundred and fifty yuan after arriving in Tianjin. You have to lose more than two hundred yuan per package. If it is smuggled into the country without tax, each package can be sold for one hundred and eighty yuan. In addition to the cost, you can make a net profit of thirty yuan. Taking this as an example, smugglers are naturally rampant, but in order to maintain the integrity of tariffs, I will definitely not unilaterally reduce tariffs on Japanese goods or formulate separate tariff rules for North China Customs. However, apart from these two methods, we must seek other good strategies to curb the source. Our loss is too great." (1st)</p>
<h3>Gao Guizi Talks About the Situation of Suppressing Bandits in Shanxi and Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Mr. Gao recently arrived in Beiping from Shaanxi.</p>
<p>The reason why the communist bandits fled to Shanxi was to find food.</p>
<p>The bandits in Shaanxi can be wiped out within a month.</p>
<p>Beiping dispatch: Gao Guizi, commander of the 84th Division, flew from Suide on the 19th of last month to Xi'an, and yesterday (the 2nd) flew from Xi'an to Zhengzhou, staying overnight. This morning (the 3rd) at approximately 11:00 AM, he flew from Zhengzhou to Beiping again, landing at Nanyuan Airport. After getting off the plane, Gao immediately entered the city and returned to his private residence to rest. In the afternoon, he visited the local authorities. It was decided that he would go to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for a physical examination tomorrow (the 4th) morning and plans to stay in Beiping for a week before returning to his defense to supervise the suppression of the remaining bandits. This afternoon (the 3rd), the reporter visited Gao at his private residence. Gao provided a very detailed account of the bandit suppression situation in Shanxi and Shaanxi. According to him, "The military operations to suppress bandits in Shanxi Province are extremely smooth. Important passes on the east side of the river, such as Sanjiaozhen Xinguan Ferry, have been recovered by the National Army. However, the ferry on the west side of the river is still in the hands of the bandit army, but it will definitely be recovered soon. It is rumored that the bandits in Shanxi will return to northern Shaanxi. I (Gao refers to himself) have not received any reports. An investigation revealed that the bandits in northern Shaanxi started to flee to Shanxi because they had no food. From a logical point of view, the rumor of their return is unbelievable. According to reconnaissance reports, there are over a thousand bandits in northern Shanxi, all hiding in the deep mountains. There are a relatively large number of bandits near Hongdong County in southern Shanxi. The bandits in western Shanxi are scattered in small groups and are not a major concern. The above-mentioned bandits are, in fact, trapped in a large encirclement and will definitely be wiped out soon. As for the situation in northern Shaanxi, there are about 20,000 bandits, all scattered in various places, acting like roaming bandits. They have less than 10,000 rifles. Among them, Liu Zidan's faction of 3,000 men is relatively organized, but it is not a concern. The number of bandit suppression troops is ten times that of the bandits, and suppression should not be difficult. However, the supplies for each army are not sufficient, so the military operations are slightly delayed. The Northeast Army participating in the bandit suppression has experience in bandit suppression. Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang has ordered that the bandits in Shaanxi be wiped out within a month. A large-scale encirclement and suppression will soon be launched. The political work in the recovered bandit areas is the construction of military village residences. The refugees who are taken in are protected by the army to prevent them from being used by the bandits again. These shelters are built every ten miles, forming a fortress. Surrendered refugees live here and are protected by the garrison troops. After Xu Haidong and Mao Zedong's bandit troops fled to Shaanxi, because there were too many people and not enough food, they constantly levied supplies from the poor, causing resentment and losing faith. Although the bandits initially used the confiscation of the rich's grain to help the poor as bait, it has now become clear that it is purely a deceptive policy. Recently, the bandits have also been conscripting young men from the people, and most of the wounded soldiers transported back from the front lines every day are local young men. Witnessing this is heartbreaking and has aroused a sense of sorrow for others. Therefore, when the government troops arrive and recover the bandit areas, the people welcome them on both sides of the road and ask to be taken in. Those responsible for political work are responsible for handling the food and accommodation issues after the reception. I will stay in Beiping for a week and then return to my defense to supervise the suppression of the remaining bandits." (April 3rd)</p>
<h3>Twenty Provincial Governments Hold Small-Scale Loans</h3>
<p>Relieve the small-scale business operations of civilians.</p>
<p>And order all counties to crack down on apportionment of funds.</p>
<p>Lanzhou dispatch: Due to past natural disasters and man-made calamities in various counties of Gansu Province, the rural areas were bankrupt and the people had no means of livelihood. In recent years, although the political situation has gradually gotten on track and the people have been able to recuperate, the rural areas have gradually become active, but the general public still feels that life is difficult, and even has nowhere to turn. Although they want to seek a small-scale business to make a living, they have no capital to turn to. Although the provincial capital now has rural credit cooperative facilities, ordinary civilians outside the system still have no way to make a living. Provincial Government Chairman Yu, in view of this, specifically ordered the Ping City Government Money Bureau of this province to set up a small-scale loan office, imitating the small-scale loan methods in Pingjin and other places. If civilians go to borrow money, they will be given small-scale loans according to the situation. The bureau has now followed the proposed method, and after it is approved, it can start preparations, starting with the provincial capital. In the future, when the bureau has sufficient funds, it will consider the needs of various places and find ways to popularize it in various counties to benefit the people. In addition to providing small-scale business operations for the relief of the people, the provincial government also deeply considers the suffering of the people. The village chiefs and heads of the counties and districts in this province often take advantage of the name of handling village chiefs and heads to arbitrarily apportion funds from the people, which makes the people unable to bear the burden and causes them great pain. Therefore, a notice was issued to strictly crack down on this practice, and the county magistrates were ordered to strictly prohibit it. The notice stated, "The handling of the village chiefs and heads in various counties and bureaus in this province is solely for the purpose of eliminating bandits and maintaining security. However, according to recent reports, the village chiefs and heads of various counties and districts are arbitrarily apportioning funds from the people. If this is not strictly cracked down on, the harm will be no small matter. In addition to separately ordering the county magistrates to strictly prohibit it, this notice is hereby issued to inform all village chiefs, heads, and the public. From now on, after this notice is issued, if the aforementioned apportionment abuses occur again, once they are found out or reported, they will definitely be severely punished according to law and will not be tolerated."</p>
<h3>Liu Suijiu, Advisor to the Hunan Provincial Government, Talks About Hunan Politics</h3>
<p>—The Hunan authorities are making every effort to preserve their inherent culture—</p>
<p>Beijing dispatch: Since the news that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is about to open to traffic has spread, the relationship between the provinces along the route and the central government and various parties has become closer. Hunan Province, which is located in the center of the route, is in an even better position. Therefore, everything about Hunan Province should be known to the people of the country. I have recently learned that Liu Huarui (Suijiu), advisor to the Hunan Provincial Government, has come to Beijing from Hunan. The reporter visited him at the Central Hotel to inquire about the situation in Hunan as follows: The reporter asked, "It is rumored that Hunan Province tends to be conservative, and that Chairman He's thinking is particularly old-fashioned. I wonder if this is true?" Mr. Liu replied, "Hunan has deep roots in its inherent culture. In the past, an American wanted to establish a university in China. After a long period of investigation, he decided to establish Xiangya Medical College in Hunan. His intention was to generate the newest culture in the most conservative place. Mr. He Jian is not stubbornly old-fashioned. His intention is the same as the original purpose of the American founder of Xiangya Medical College. I (Mr. Liu) have traveled extensively to various countries and know that all countries cherish historical relics. The large number of museums and libraries are specifically for preserving ancient documents. The reformers in China misunderstood reform as overthrowing inherent culture, and there was even a movement to not read Chinese books and abolish the use of Chinese characters, which is ridiculed by the whole world. Even Soviet Russia does not have this kind of action. What does Hunan Province think of the central government? Since Mr. He Jian took charge of military and civilian administration in Hunan Province, he has been determined to focus on local work for the past seven or eight years, believing that if all provinces can be law-abiding and revitalize local cultural politics, then gathering the good governance of all provinces can naturally create a strong country. However, Hunan Province's finances are tight, and although the military and civilians have worked together to engage in construction, they ultimately feel powerless. Can you tell me about the sacrificial ceremony for Confucius in Hunan Province? Confucius is a great Confucian, just like governments and societies in various countries hold commemorative ceremonies for Shakespeare, Voltaire, Kant, and other great literary and artistic figures to express admiration. Moreover, the music and dance rituals for sacrificing Confucius are well preserved in Hunan Province. Recently, a certain music master from a certain country, Mr. Yafusha Samo, etc., wanted to go to Hunan Province to specialize in investigating and researching the sacrificial music and dance and the music and dance of the Miao ethnic group, because they considered it to have international cultural value. I saw in the newspaper that Mr. He Jian does not approve of left-leaning ideas. I wonder what his opinion is on the policy of alliance with Russia? Most of the left-leaning thinkers in China have no real international knowledge and most of them have not even traveled to Russia. They are only dreaming of communism. They completely fail to learn from the good things about the Soviet Union, such as promoting Russian domestic literature, sorting out documents, and working hard in industry. Everyone must have specialized skills. They only go to chant slogans, talk empty words, and do all kinds of destructive work, so they do not approve of it. As for the alliance with Russia, it is a matter of diplomatic relations and the central government is responsible for it. Recently, there have been rumors that the Hunan Provincial Government is going to be reorganized. Is this true? The people in the Hunan Provincial Government can all work hard for the public and have harmonious relationships. The achievements in construction in recent years have not only been understood by the Chinese people, but also praised by people from various countries who have come to Hunan Province for inspection. Many reports on the Hunan Province leaders and their measures are published in Western newspapers. At this critical moment of life and death in China, the central government should also be happy to have this screen and will not easily make changes."</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Deadline for Lake Field Registration is Extended by One Month</p>
<p>In order to clean up Taihu Lake fields, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specially established the Taihu Lake Field Cleaning Office in Suzhou and appointed Dong Binqian as the director. Since February of this year, a Taihu Lake field registration has been held. Three registration offices have been set up in Hengjing and other townships to handle registration matters. However, because the general lakeside farmers did not understand the truth, they did not come forward, resulting in not very enthusiastic registration. In order to facilitate the farmers, Director Dong decided to extend the deadline for one month starting today (the 5th), so that the lakeside farmers can quickly go to the office to register to secure their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Some Public Prostitutes Opened for Business Yesterday</p>
<p>The Wuxian Public Security Bureau has been preparing for the public prostitution affairs for four months. There are more than two hundred registered public prostitutes in the first, second, and third classes. Twenty-eight first-class prostitutes, including Lin Xiangquan, who have been tested negative for syphilis and leukorrhea, and second-class prostitutes, including Juanjuan, have been issued business licenses and have been serving customers since yesterday (the 4th) in places such as Minqingli. However, they are only allowed to receive customers in the brothels and are not allowed to solicit customers in various hotels or go to various restaurants. As for the remaining one hundred and seventy third-class prostitutes, they will be issued licenses for business after the county hospital completes the examination procedures. The Public Security Bureau has ordered a strict investigation of private prostitutes.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob Farmers and Suffer Serious Injuries</p>
<p>The Yeren Temple near Zhipu Township in the fourth district of the county is located in a remote area and has always been a haunt for bandits. At about 11:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came, holding box cannons, and broke into the homes of Qin Xiaoyuan and Yu Asan, who were leasing land from Shaoxing people, to rob them. Qin and others were awakened from their dreams and rushed to other places to hide. More than ten stones of white rice and other clothes and other items were robbed. Neighbors Qin Yutang and Huang Jingshan heard the alarm and went to rescue them, but were shot by the bandits. Huang Jingshan was only slightly injured, while Qin Yutang's thigh bone was broken, and he suffered serious injuries in various parts of his body. He lost too much blood, and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The County Government Seals Up Zhongwai Pharmacy</p>
<p>On the 24th of last month, the Supervision Office of the County Public Security Bureau found Babbinal morphine needles and heroin needles in the Taihe Pharmacy on North Street. Because the quantity exceeded the prescribed amount, the pharmacist Yang Suiliang was taken to the bureau and transferred to the county for interrogation and detention. The next day, the Taihe Pharmacy was sealed up. According to the confession of the captured criminal Yang Suiliang, Hu Shutang, who opened Zhongwai Pharmacy, is actually the major shareholder and general manager of Taihe Pharmacy, and the manager is Lu Yunxiang, etc. Yesterday, the county government specially ordered the Public Security Bureau to bring seals and go to Zhongwai Pharmacy and Hu Shutang's home in Zhoushi Lane, as well as Lu Yunxiang's home in Nanfangquan, and seal up all three shops and houses. Since Lu and others are all at large, the provincial garrison headquarters has been notified to issue arrest warrants.</p>
<p>Special Commissioner Strictly Prohibits Farmer Riots</p>
<p>According to Deng Haixiang, the magistrate of Wuxian County, a small number of local ruffians and farmers in the county are using the issue of land rent to incite farmers to gather and riot, even burning houses and destroying public security bureaus. Such disregard for the law not only endangers the property of landlords, but also destroys local security. They should be strictly banned, etc. After receiving the report, Special Commissioner Zang printed and issued a notice strictly prohibiting farmer riots.</p>
<h3>Jintan</h3>
<p>The Magistrate of Jintan County Accepts Lawsuits in Court</p>
<p>Many counties in Jiangsu Province also handle judicial affairs. Jintan County is one of them. However, in civil and criminal lawsuits in the county, the parties are often illiterate. Whenever there is a dispute that cannot be mediated in the countryside, they go to the city to hire lawyers to write lawsuits and submit them to the county government. The lawyers then take over the case and become more and more rampant. Sometimes, lawsuits are dragged on for years, causing endless trouble. There are even cases of fabricating false accusations in the hope of framing others. Magistrate Yang Zhuomao often personally appeared in court to hear difficult cases during his tenure in Fengxian. He sought to be fair and impartial in his judgment. He decided to be transferred to Jintan. He investigated that the former County Magistrate Qi Lunji had proposed a method of accepting lawsuits in court and submitted it to the Jiangsu Higher Court for approval. Yang believes that this method can indeed prevent lawyers from taking over cases and defrauding money, and can also eliminate false accusations and reduce the burden of lawsuits on the people. Therefore, the previous day, he issued a notice to continue accepting lawsuits in court. The time for accepting lawsuits is from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. Important criminal cases are accepted upon arrival. When accepting lawsuits, the county magistrate or the trial officer will personally come to the court to inquire, and the clerk will make a record. When the parties proofread and find no mistakes, it will replace the draft lawsuit. If the party is illiterate, the clerk will read it aloud in court, and its effect will be the same as personal proofreading.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Drug Offenders Die One After Another in Prison</p>
<p>After Wu County received orders to conduct a general inspection of drug offenders, a large number of drug offenders were arrested in urban and rural areas. Most of them were detained in the second branch of the Yaowang Temple Drug Offenders Prison. After arriving at the prison, the drug offenders felt the pain of withdrawal, resulting in the death of four people a few days ago. On the 3rd of this month, Yao Jifa also died. Prison guard Li Yurui also reported to the county government for instructions on twelve critically ill drug offenders, including Zhu Peisheng and Qian Rongsheng.</p>

Peng Shiqin and other members of the survey team of the Department of Agricultural Society of the National Zhejiang College, Zheng Houbo, Xu Chao and other students of Zhejiang Agricultural College visited Dan on the 3rd to visit the cooperative business. They first went to the Danyang Cooperative Experimental Zone to inquire about the work situation in detail. Director Li received and answered them in detail. In the evening at 8:00 PM, the team took a car to Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Special Commissioner's Office Tries Bandit Cases in the District</p>
<p>Bandits are rampant in the counties of Tongshu. The Provincial Security Headquarters has ordered the Nantong District Special Commissioner's Office to try serious bandit cases in the various counties. Recently, many captured bandits have been sent from various places, causing the military judges to be unable to handle them in time. Special Commissioner Ge has submitted a request to the province to approve the addition of one military judge to separately try drug and bandit cases.</p>
<h3>Lanxi</h3>
<p>Jinhua Shenyuan Money Shop</p>
<p>The Process of Cracking the Major Robbery Case</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM on December 31st last year, three robbers suddenly pretended to buy aviation lottery tickets at the Shenyuan Money Shop on West Street in Jinhua. The shop assistant Lao Xiankai went to open the door, and the three robbers rushed in and robbed 227 yuan in miscellaneous yuan banknotes, 7,200 yuan in Chinese Bank five-yuan banknotes (most of which were printed with the words "Jin Yu"), 150 yuan in current ocean, including two yuan in all-lead coins, one yuan in all-copper coins, thirty-seven yuan in auxiliary currency coupons printed with the word "Hui", twenty yuan in one-jiao auxiliary currency coupons, one hundred and eighty-three double silver jiao, fifty single silver jiao, and fifteen copper coins. The military and police agencies of the county were immediately notified to search and arrest them separately, but no results were obtained. The provincial authorities also paid great attention. The Lanxi County Government, considering that Jinhua is adjacent to Lanxi and transportation is convenient, was deeply concerned that the bandits would escape to the county and endanger security. It repeatedly convened its police officers to discuss the matter in detail and decided to assist in the arrest. Later, in February of this year, it was discovered that Ye Nianqing, who lived in Xiashen Village, Shetang Township, and Zheng Ahe, Zheng Longyou, and Zheng Muchun, who lived in Xinqiao, Huxi Township, were highly suspicious. On the morning of March 30th, at 12:00 AM, detective teams were ordered to search and arrest them separately. As a result, 280 Chinese Bank five-yuan banknotes (most of which were printed with the words "Jin Yu") and fifty silver coins were seized at Zheng Ahe's house; 450 Chinese Bank five-yuan banknotes, fifty one-jiao silver coins (including one small silver coin from Hong Kong), and forty-two silver coins were seized at Zheng Longyou's house, including two yuan in all-lead coins, one yuan in copper coins, and the word "Hui"; and 425 Chinese Bank five-yuan banknotes (most of which were also printed with the words "Jin Yu") and twenty-two silver coins were seized at Zheng Muchun's house. Nothing was found at Ye Nianqing's house, but six yuan in banknotes and ocean, five double silver jiao, and seven jiao in auxiliary currency coupons were found on his body. Zheng Ahe, Zheng Longyou, and Ye Nianqing were arrested on the spot. Zheng Muchun was not arrested because he went out to buy cattle the day before. They were all escorted to the county for interrogation together with the stolen goods. It was then learned that the case was initiated by Zhu Cuiming, a shop assistant at the Shenyuan Money Shop (30 years old, from Yiwu, living in Zhu Tongmao Pig Shop outside Nanmen, Lanxi, with a long face, short flat hair, wearing a gray-green cloth long gown and a melon skin hat). In November of the lunar calendar last year, he went to Yongchang to meet Ye Nianqing and hired Zheng Ahe, Zheng Longyou, and Zheng Muchun to rob the money shop. On December 30th, Ye Nianqing escorted Zheng Ahe and the other two to Lanxi County. The next day (the 31st), they went to the money shop. Zhu Cuiming had agreed to meet at the Dashou Tea Shop in Jinhua County in advance. They arrived around 3:00 PM and met Zhu Cuiming. The three robbers followed Zhu's instructions and went to rob the money shop at 6:00 PM. Zhu Cuiming was also in the money shop at the time. The two robbers, Zhu and Zheng, who were at large, have been ordered to be arrested separately.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Tombs in the Urban Area Must Be Demolished Within a Time Limit</p>
<p>The Yin County Government ordered that tombs in the urban areas of various towns must be registered with the town offices before the 15th of this month. The town offices have all issued notices to comply. The county government has now issued a notice that all tombs in the old urban area, whether real or floating, must be demolished by the tomb owners before May 10th of this year. Therefore, the Jiangdong, Jiangbei, Nanjiao, and Xijiao town offices have closed the tomb registration. Those who have registered have been ordered to demolish the tombs by the deadline.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Letter from the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Border Region:</p>
<p>To the Editor of the *Shen Bao*:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to your newspaper's "Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei" column on March 25th, which contained allegations of poor military discipline by the 35th Brigade and the false accusation and killing of four innocent civilians, including Li Qisheng. I was extremely shocked by this. The 35th Brigade is under the command of this headquarters and has been very meritorious in suppressing bandits in the southern Hubei area. Their usual military discipline is also good. As for the case of the bandit spies Li Qisheng and others, the facts are even more inconsistent with what your newspaper reported. It is obvious that your reporter was misinformed. The truth is that Li Qisheng and others joined the bandits in April of the 24th year of the Republic of China and initially worked as guerrillas in places like Gushan. In January of this year, they were ordered by Zhao Ganqing, the seventh commander of the fake 16th Army, to pretend to be small laborers and set out from Badoushan to Chongyang to spy on the deployment of the garrison troops. On the 20th of that month, they arrived at Hongxia, where they were found to be carrying secret bandit codes. They were immediately arrested by the 35th Brigade and sent to the brigade headquarters. After repeated interrogation by the brigade headquarters, their guilt was confirmed, and they were sentenced to death according to the law. This was also approved by this headquarters. This shows that the accusation of falsely accusing innocent people as bandits is not true. This matter concerns the reputation of the military. Therefore, I am writing to request that your newspaper publish a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Border Region</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Pays Farewell Visit to the City Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hosted Reception for Chinese and Foreign Press Last Night</p>
<p>Leaves for Home Tonight with Family</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: British Ambassador to China, Sir Alexander Cadogan, is scheduled to leave Shanghai tonight with his wife, family members, and staff aboard the Canadian Pacific's Empress of Canada, heading to Canada and Japan before returning to his country to take up his new post as Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Sir Alexander has been very busy with social engagements with various Chinese and foreign circles in Shanghai these days. He visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng at 11:40 am yesterday to bid farewell. Then, at 6 pm, he hosted a farewell reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Cathay Hotel. Details of the events are as follows:</p>
<p>Visit to the Mayor: Sir Alexander, accompanied by his secretary and others, visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng at the City Government at 11:40 am yesterday to bid farewell. The City Government had previously instructed the Public Security Bureau to dispatch a platoon of armed police and a military band to stand guard and welcome him in front of the City Government's main gate. When Sir Alexander's car arrived at the City Government, the military band played, and the police presented arms. Mayor Wu, accompanied by his secretary Tang Shixuan and others, greeted him at the door. Sir Alexander entered the City Government auditorium amidst the music and then went upstairs for a 20-minute meeting before returning to the Cathay Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Reception for Journalists: New Citizen News Agency reports that the British Ambassador held a reception for reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies on the sixth floor of the Cathay Hotel last night at 6 pm and delivered a farewell speech. More than 20 representatives from various Chinese, British, Japanese, and other national newspapers and news agencies attended. Sir Alexander first stated that the most important issue between China and Britain is the revision of the unequal treaties. The Chinese people are striving to break free from the shackles of the unequal treaties, and Britain is very willing to revise them at any opportunity. As for the Yunnan-Burma border demarcation issue, since the representatives from China and Britain, along with members of neutral nations, began the demarcation, things have been going very smoothly. Although it is temporarily suspended now, it is entirely due to weather conditions. Once autumn arrives, it will certainly continue and be resolved satisfactorily. He then stated that he has been stationed in China for two years since succeeding Sir Miles Lampson as British Minister to China. Based on his observations, China has made significant progress in all areas. In particular, the New Life Movement is an excellent initiative. Although I cannot say what the results will be, the fact that everything is on track is a fact. Although there are still bandits causing disturbances in some places, it is unavoidable given the vastness of the country. Fortunately, the authorities are cracking down on them severely and will completely eradicate them. The eastward spread of new European civilization is becoming increasingly close to China, and China will inevitably become aligned with European countries. I sincerely hope that China will gradually progress and have a bright future. Sir Alexander then answered reporters' questions, stating that: If possible, Britain is willing to cooperate with any country regarding China, not just Japan; British investment in China is mainly concentrated in Shanghai and the Yangtze River area, with Shanghai being the most important. Its interests will be protected at all times; Britain is paying close attention to smuggling in North China, considering it an important issue; During his return trip, he will only stay in Japan for two days. He plans to spend one day sightseeing, and if the Japanese authorities wish to meet with him on the other day, he will visit them. However, since there is only one day, there will certainly be no discussion of any issues, just a courtesy call; Britain has decided to establish a financial advisor in Shanghai and Tokyo, subordinate to the embassies in both countries, and has internally appointed Mr. Hall Patch, assistant to Sir Otto Niemeyer, who is currently in Shanghai, to the position. His role will be the same as that of the financial advisors Britain has stationed in Washington and Berlin. For example, during my tenure, I often felt the need for such an advisor to assist with financial and technical matters; Britain will not discuss the issue of recognizing the so-called "Manchukuo" at all because Britain is a member of the League of Nations and must abide by the League's resolutions and other treaties; Regarding how Britain will maintain its interests in China, he does not want to discuss it during this trip to Tokyo. If it needs to be discussed, it must be in London, and he will contribute his opinions as much as possible; He has not heard about the United States withdrawing its troops stationed in North China. Britain has no such plans, and if necessary, all countries must act together. Britain and the United States cannot act alone; There have been no recent negotiations between China and Britain regarding the linking of the Canton-Kowloon and Canton-Hankow railways; British loans to China depend on the attitude of investors in London and the nature of the collateral provided by China; He has not heard of the rumors of a secret treaty between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Departure Tonight: New Citizen News Agency reports that the British business community in Shanghai will hold a farewell reception at the Bund Consulate General at 11 am today, with the British garrison, the Lancashire Regiment, providing a guard of honor. Sir Alexander, his wife, and his two daughters are scheduled to board the Canadian Pacific's Empress of Canada at 7:30 pm tonight and depart for home. The ship will dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf on East Broadway Road. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai, Zhou Jue, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, British consular officials, and British community leaders will go to the wharf to see them off.</p>
<h3>Possibility of Complete Withdrawal of US Troops from China</h3>
<p>War Between US and Japan Still Distant</p>
<p>Current Troops Stationed Are of Little Use</p>
<p>Continental Daily News reports that, according to the Washington correspondent of the New Republic, the US government is seriously considering withdrawing its troops stationed in China as soon as possible due to the recent incidents in North China, including the 600 guards at the US Embassy, the 800 soldiers of the 15th Infantry Regiment stationed in Tianjin, and the 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai. The Continental Daily News reporter was unable to contact officials of the 4th Marine Regiment yesterday, but according to a reporter from a certain newspaper who recently returned to Shanghai from North China, this news is highly reliable based on his investigation. However, he could not be sure whether the Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai and the navy stationed on the Chinese seas would also be withdrawn, but the lease for the Tianjin barracks has recently been extended for another year. The article in the New Republic was written by a well-informed and talented correspondent. It mainly stated that relations between Japan and China and Russia, and between Japan and Western countries, will inevitably break down sooner or later. Experts on this issue all believe that the United States will not go to war with Japan alone, no matter how much its commercial interests are damaged. This is not due to the government's excessive pacifism, but because the navy is unwilling to risk war. The naval command has warned the government that it is not appropriate to start hostilities lightly until the appropriate bases in the Pacific are fully deployed. The authorities have considered building naval bases on Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam, but all have been deemed inappropriate and abandoned because the navy wants a base capable of repairing warships of 33,000 tons. However, maintaining such a base on an island in the Pacific is very difficult in peacetime. The naval community wants a base in Manila Bay so that the main battleships can safely berth there to await battle once war breaks out. According to naval experts, the war between the US and Japan is still distant, at least until 1940, so there is still time to deploy. As for the army, only General MacArthur is paying attention to a possible war with Japan. Several months ago, the general resigned from his position as Chief of Staff of the Army and went to the Philippines to organize the newly recruited Philippine army, believing that this army could be used in the future in a war with Japan. When the Kwantung Army first exerted pressure in North China three months ago, representatives from the State Department, the Army, and the Navy met in Washington to discuss the withdrawal of the US troops stationed in Tianjin and the US naval patrol on the Yangtze River. All attendees believed that the troops stationed in the Far East were of little use, and the United States should avoid contact with the Japanese army at all costs. However, some people opposed the withdrawal at this time, fearing that other countries might suspect that the United States had a secret agreement with Japan. For this reason, it was not implemented. However, it is reported that the US government currently intends to withdraw all US troops stationed in China as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>New Director of Shanghai Navigation Bureau, Wu Yu, to Take Office on Schedule</h3>
<p>Peng Hu, Director of the Shanghai Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, has repeatedly resigned due to illness. The Ministry has approved his resignation and appointed Wu Yu as his replacement. Wu graduated from the Japanese Naval Artillery and Torpedo Schools' officer training program and is a veteran member of the Kuomintang. He is currently the Director of Maritime Transport of the Military Affairs Commission. Wu has already arrived in Shanghai and is scheduled to take office on the 10th of this month. The outgoing Director, Peng Hu, is currently rushing to complete the handover.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings Bureau to Launch Children's Savings Scheme</h3>
<p>Requests Assistance from School Authorities</p>
<p>Can Be Implemented Shortly</p>
<p>This year is Children's Year, and in order to encourage children's savings, the Ministry of Communications has instructed the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to plan the establishment of a children's savings scheme. The savings department of the bureau is currently drafting the regulations. According to the person in charge of the bureau, postal offices in various countries have had good results in running children's savings schemes. The method is very simple. The bureau rents savings machines to various schools and organizations. Children can put their money into the machines, which will then dispense stamps of the same value as receipts for the savings. The bureau then sends postmen to collect the savings at regular intervals for accounting purposes. However, since our country's currency system is not yet unified and this business is still in its infancy, it is difficult to imitate. It is currently planned to be implemented in schools, and with the assistance of the school authorities, it will be easier to implement and avoid huge expenses. It is reported that this savings scheme can be implemented in a short period of time.</p>

After the customary formalities, the chairman gave a speech (recorded separately) and reported on the business situation for the 24th year. Then, supervisor Lu Xuepu reported on the final accounts for the 24th year. Subsequently, the appropriation of public reserve and dividends for the 24th year was discussed.

I am very pleased to have all shareholders present. I have been the chairman of this bank for one year since taking over last year. During this year, we have experienced difficult times in our country, such as the floods in various provinces and the disturbances in North China. Internal and external troubles have come one after another, and the social economy has shown little vitality. The most affected is our financial sector. Recognizing the seriousness of this situation, the government resolutely implemented currency reform to remedy the situation. All colleagues in this bank have worked hard together in the difficult process to avoid making any mistakes. Furthermore, because this bank has always been trusted by society, its issuance has increased rather than decreased during this period of financial upheaval, and its business has continued to expand. Since the establishment of the savings department last year, small savings have been very popular, and deposits in various banks have also increased at the same time. We have strived to promote foreign exchange and have established branches in New York and Singapore to gradually develop overseas business. All of these major points have been explained separately in detail in the report. Please refer to it, and I will not repeat them here."</p>

<h3>Chambers of Commerce and Others Petition Yuan and Ministry to Reduce Pacific Telegraph Rates</h3>
<p>Recommend Zou Bingwen and Others to Go to Capital to Present Case</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the China International Trade Association, the Sino-American Trade Association, and the China Council of the International Chamber of Commerce, yesterday petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, stating: "We petition for the reduction of Pacific telegraph rates to facilitate foreign trade. All countries, in order to promote foreign trade, in addition to striving to improve products and reduce costs, spare no effort to resolve anything that hinders trade, such as exemptions from export taxes, reductions in transportation costs, and reductions in telegraph rates. There are established precedents, and there is no need to elaborate. To promote foreign trade, one should cater to the psychology of foreign buyers with goods of good quality and low price, and reduce their burdens so that operators have profits to make. The aforementioned reductions in taxes, transportation fees, and telegraph rates can directly reduce costs and indirectly increase trade profits. Our country has already completely exempted several export commodities from export taxes. As for foreign shipping, we mostly rely on foreign merchants and have almost no right to intervene. Only the telegraph service, since the establishment and operation of the bureau by the Ministry of Communications of your Yuan, has this sovereign right been in our hands. However, the Pacific telegraph rates stipulated by our country are higher than those of other Pacific countries. We will list the telegraph fees from Japan, the Philippines, and our country to various countries for comparison. From the two tables above, it can be seen that the price of telegrams from our country to Europe and the United States is higher than that of other countries. This situation is not only sufficient to hinder the development of foreign trade, but the entire foreign publicity will also be affected. In order to reduce the burden on exporters and expand foreign trade, our associations have jointly petitioned your Yuan, hoping that you will recognize the importance of the matter and reduce the Pacific telegraph rates. We also recommend Zou Bingwen and Miao Zhongxiu as representatives to visit your superiors and present everything in person. If you are willing to grant approval, it will greatly benefit the livelihood of the people and the national economy. We respectfully submit this to Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Yu, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Communications of the Executive Yuan of the National Government."</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Re-enter Beijing in Two Weeks</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, who went to the capital with illness, left Beijing by overnight express train the night before last, accompanied by his secretaries Feng Zhizheng and Xiao Jinfang. He arrived at the North Station at about 7 am on the 4th. Those who went to welcome him included Zhu Yongshou and Tan Haiqiu. After Wang got off the train, he went to see a doctor first and visited relatives and friends. It was not until about 10 am that he returned to the Hu residence on Gaen Road to rest and met with Cheng Tiangu to report the results of his visit to President Chiang, so that he could send a telegram to Chairman Hu of the Central Standing Committee. A reporter from the Central News Agency met Wang at the North Station. Wang, suffering from a recurrence of nasal membranitis and swelling of his upper lip, which was covered in ointment, did not speak any further and asked Ma and Xiao to convey everything on his behalf. According to them, Wang was very busy with social engagements on the first day of his trip to Beijing, which caused his nasal illness to recur on the second day. He immediately went to the Central Hospital for treatment. The doctor said that it would take three weeks to fully recover. Wang therefore returned to Shanghai to continue treatment and recuperate. However, due to the short time he stayed in Beijing this time, he was unable to meet with all the comrades and friends he had planned to meet. Therefore, he decided to go to Beijing again after he recovers, and then come to Shanghai to wait for a ship to go south. As for when he will re-enter Beijing, it will be at least two weeks later.</p>
<h3>Wei Daoming and Sun Jiazhe to Arrive in Shanghai on the Same Ship This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Wei Carrying the Mandate of Hu Hanmin, Sun Serving Chen Jitang's Delegation</p>
<p>To Immediately Go to Beijing to Meet President Chiang and Others to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>Wei Daoming, the former Minister of Judicial Administration, went south from Shanghai a month ago to meet with Central Committee member Dr. Wang Chonghui, originally intending to return north with Wang. It was later decided that he would temporarily stay in Hong Kong and Guangdong to communicate news between Wang and Chairman Hu Hanmin of the Central Standing Committee. Wei, carrying Hu's mandate, returned north by the Canadian Pacific's Empress of Canada the day before yesterday. Also on the ship was Sun Jiazhe, a member of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and a member of the Fujian Provincial Government, who came north with the mandate of Chen Jitang, the Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong, to meet with the central authorities and discuss important matters. He passed through Hong Kong and happened to be on the same ship as Wei. According to shipping company sources, the ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 12:30 pm this afternoon and dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf on East Broadway Road. At that time, Feng Zhizheng and Xiao Jinfang, secretaries sent by Wang, Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang stationed in Beijing, and relatives and friends of Wei and Sun will all go to the ship to welcome them. It is heard that Wei will meet with Wang Chonghui to report after arriving in Shanghai. Sun will visit Chiang Bocheng, the Chief Counselor of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission's headquarters, and then go to Beijing to meet with President Chiang and other authorities to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Xiang, Sui, and Qian Three Provinces Respond; Solicit Donations to Purchase an Airplane as Birthday Gift</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and Others Promote Birthday Fundraisers</p>
<p>Liquor and Food Industry Subcommittee Held Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association initiated a campaign to purchase and donate an airplane to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday. Various provinces and cities have telegraphed their agreement, as reported previously. It is now known that the Association has recently received telegrams from the Hunan Provincial Branch, the Guizhou Provincial Government, and the Suiyuan Provincial Government, the contents of which are detailed below: The Hunan Provincial Branch decided to temporarily raise funds to purchase one airplane, totaling 100,000 yuan. If more funds are available in the future, additional purchases will be made. The deadline for collecting funds is the end of the month. It is planned to name the airplane "Heng," signifying lofty and great aspirations, longevity comparable to Mount Heng, and promoting the spirit of the nation. It will be presented in the name of the Provincial Government and the Branch. The Guizhou Provincial Government convened representatives from various sectors, including the Party, government, gentry, business, and education, and decided to raise 100,000 yuan to purchase and donate one airplane first. It is planned to name it "Guizhou." The Suiyuan Province decided to raise 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to purchase a small airplane to express congratulations. However, due to the province's poverty, only 15,000 yuan has been raised so far. It is unknown whether 20,000 to 30,000 yuan will be sufficient to purchase a small airplane. If it is sufficient, they plan to make every effort to raise the full 30,000 yuan. If it is insufficient or if the full amount cannot be raised, the donated funds will be added to those of other provinces and donated together.</p>
<p>Li Dachao, the Chief Secretary of the Fundraising Committee for Airplane Purchase as a Birthday Gift, believes that the purchase of an airplane as a birthday gift is of great significance and should be widely solicited to accumulate resources and complete the mission as soon as possible. He initiated a birthday fundraising campaign, distributing it to the directors of the Chinese Aviation Association, requesting that they copy fifteen copies within twenty-four hours of receipt, keep one copy for themselves, attach one yuan in national currency, and send it to the birthday celebration committee for collection. The remaining copies should be sent to relatives and friends to promote the campaign. Yesterday, the Association received responses to the fundraising from Mayor Wu, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Nie Wenyi, etc., who attached one yuan each. It is reported that they have been received and thanked. Furthermore, the Customs Supervision Office, the International Trade Bureau, the Chinese Animal Protection Association, the Shanghai Special District Second Citizen Union, the Salted Fish Trade Association, and leaders from various circles, such as Yao Mulian and Zai Shao Cheng, have also agreed to participate as initiators.</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the General Team held a meeting at its office at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 3rd), convening all members of the Committee for Collecting Aviation Patriotic Funds from the Liquor and Food Industry. Attendees included Cheng Shuzhi (Coco Food Company), Su Chusheng (Fuxing Garden), Zheng Jiarui (Hongxing Building), Hong Chun (Zhimei Building), Li Mancun (Xinghua Building), Yan Binsen (Taolechun), Zhang Rongxi (Qingping Garden), Sun Weixi (Tongxing Building), Lin Yuqing (Xiaoyoutian), Zhao Yunshao (Gongdelin), Cheng Kefan, Wang Wenkui (Dalichun), Zhang Qingyun (Xinlicha), Liu Qiusheng, Ruan Shaichiao, Zhu Ligong, Yang Shengru, Song Guisheng, Liu Songtao, Shan Jianbao, Xu Bingrong, etc., chaired by Li Dachao, the General Secretary. The report briefly stated that the collection of aviation patriotic funds from the industry has been actively supported by the industry and enthusiastically donated by all sectors, resulting in excellent achievements. A few weeks ago, the authorities of the two concession areas stated that the collection of aviation patriotic funds should be handled under the principle of voluntary donation and would not be interfered with. The Association has notified this separately by letter, hoping that all committee members will supervise the industry and actively promote it. Subsequently, discussions were held on promoting collection in accordance with the principle of voluntary donation, and collection methods were considered based on the circumstances of each liquor and food establishment. The discussions also included the possibility of publicizing the funds for a week or half a month, having members directly collect the funds and settle accounts at the end of each month for public announcement, among other proposals.

<h3>International Trade Bureau Convened Exporters and Domestic Goods Merchants for Talks the Day Before Yesterday; Discussed Establishing Domestic Goods Display Centers Overseas and Promoting Direct Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>In order to develop the export of domestic goods, the Ministry of Industry specifically instructed the local International Trade Bureau to convene domestic goods manufacturers to hold meetings and discuss everything. After receiving the order, the Bureau convened exporters for talks at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday and convened representatives of domestic goods organizations for a meeting from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday. The results of the two talks and discussions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Exporter Talks</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau convened exporters for talks at 3:00 PM on the 3rd. Attendees included Guo Jingsan (Guo Huiji Import and Export Company), Liu Shujing (Kaiji Trading Company), Gu Wensheng (Zhongxing Trading Company), Guan Bingrong (China and Foreign Trading Company), Zhu Jincai (Hua Fu), Wu Lihou (Hanli Company), Wang Hangsu (Huanan Trading Company), Su Zhaobin (Kunchanghua Trading Company), Qian Jinghou (Amateur Trading Company), etc. Wang Shinai, the Chairman of the Bureau, delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of convening the talks was twofold. First, the Bureau recently received instructions from the Ministry of Industry regarding the suggestion from the Consulate in Cairo to establish commodity display centers in key locations to showcase important Chinese commodities for observation and encourage local merchants to purchase directly from China. Second, how to promote the overall international trade issue. Everyone present today is a leader of exporters, and it is hoped that everyone will work closely with the Bureau to solve the various current difficulties in international trade. For example, horizontal aspects, such as transportation and exchange rates, are the most difficult problems currently faced by exporters. In addition, issues such as insurance and customs clearance procedures also need to be improved. Vertical aspects focus on important commodities, such as how to improve the export of silk, tea, tung oil, straw hats, lace, poplin, and pig bristles, to promote them. We should abandon empty talk and focus on practical action, gradually removing various obstacles to trade. This is the main purpose of inviting everyone today to exchange opinions. Subsequently, the exporters expressed their opinions to each other.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Merchant Talks</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau convened representatives of domestic goods organizations for talks from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Wang Shinai, Director of General Affairs of the International Trade Bureau, Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department, Zhu Xinong, Chen Jingsheng, Zhang Huikang and Hu Shicheng of the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, Zhang Shenzhi and Que Yichao of the China International Trade Association, Xu Genghua of the China National Products Maintenance Association, Fang Yexian of the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, Zhu Zumo of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Yimin of the Shanghai Machinery Federation, Zhang Zhongjie of the Ping An Industrial Factory, and representatives from more than ten organizations, including the China Industrial Federation and the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, as well as the National Goods Movement Conference of the First Special District Citizens' Union. After Chairman Wang Shinai performed the formal ceremony, he delivered a speech, stating that the purpose of convening the talks with manufacturers today could be divided into two aspects. The first is the issue of establishing national goods display centers overseas, and the second is the issue of promoting direct trade and removing trade barriers. Regarding these two points, the Bureau convened exporters yesterday for discussions and conducted detailed research. Everyone present today is a leader of national goods organizations or national goods manufacturers. You must have sufficient and detailed opinions on the issue of exporting national goods to foreign countries, which can be used as a reference for promoting foreign trade. Although imports have decreased in recent years, exports have also declined at the same time. Adjustments should be made to the balance of trade. In short, the era of promoting international trade has passed. In the future, the Bureau is willing to work with everyone to find the true reasons for the decline in foreign trade and practical solutions on how to remedy it. This is the central meaning of today's talks.</p>
<p>Results of the Two Meetings</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of establishing national goods display centers overseas, both meetings passed the principle. The representatives of national goods organizations also passed two measures: (A) Determine the types of display samples based on local needs. (B) National goods catalogs must be widely solicited from various factories. Regarding the issue of promoting direct foreign trade, the exporter representatives advocated widely soliciting opinions from all parties, compiling and studying them to determine the implementation policy. The national goods merchant representatives researched exchange rates, transportation, banks, tariffs, government protection, and national goods standards, and advocated gradually improving them and convening another meeting in the short term.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations Decided to Participate in the Taxpayer Conference Election After Receiving Orders from the Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Statement of Decision to Withdraw Was Due to Rumors</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the commercial organization group and the fellow villagers group of the Chinese Taxpayer Conference in the Public Concession will issue election tickets on the 6th of this month and announce the results on the 8th. The various trade associations in the city were previously advised by a Mr. Zhang, who claimed to be a representative of the Social Bureau, to abandon their right to vote and stamp their seals as proof. This led to more than 60 trade associations jointly stamping their seals and declaring their withdrawal from the election. After the city's Party headquarters investigated the truth, it has sent a letter to the Social Bureau for investigation and ordered various organizations not to withdraw their appointed representatives or abandon their right to vote. After receiving the order, yesterday the soy sauce industry, pastry industry, sand boat industry, yarn and cloth industry, bran industry, cooked food industry, old wood industry, flower and tree industry, lacquer and hemp industry, and paint industry, etc., more than 60 trade associations jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayer Conference in the Concession, stating: "We are writing to inform you that our associations originally intended to participate in your conference election, but due to rumors and slander, we had discussions about abandoning participation in the election. Now that we have investigated the truth, we are writing to your conference to inform you that we will still participate in the election. We hope you will take note of this."</p>
<h3>Special District Pedicabs Resumed Original State Yesterday</h3>
<p>The dispute over pedicabs in the Special District was resolved after the General Manager of the Public Works Bureau allowed the mutual aid fee to be paid in installments and continued to register the drivers. The pedicab dealers decided at a meeting the day before yesterday to inform all pedicab owners overnight that the results of the negotiations were satisfactory and that they would rent out the pedicabs immediately. Therefore, at 5:30 AM yesterday, all large and small pedicab shops rented out all their vehicles, and traffic returned to normal with excellent order. As for the pedicab rental fee, it was decided to collect 77 cents per day as stipulated by the Public Works Bureau.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation</p>
<p>The Party and government agencies in the city attached great importance to this matter. Previously, the Social Bureau and the city's Party headquarters sent personnel to investigate the truth in order to resolve it. Yesterday, because the pedicab dealers announced the resumption of business, the Party and government agencies sent personnel to inspect the resumption of business. The pedicab dealers obtained this month's licenses yesterday at Gongping Road. The trade association also sent personnel to monitor the situation. Because this matter has not been fundamentally resolved, the association decided to convene another general meeting of pedicab owners to discuss future steps and the commission for the contractors.</p>
<p>Waiting for Resolution</p>
<p>As for the points that the trade association requested the Public Works Bureau to help with, the issue of mutual aid fee collection, the mutual aid association's business and the amount of surplus collected, and the pedicab driver registration event, the association decided to wait for a response because the Public Works Bureau has not yet reviewed them. Regarding the registration of pedicab drivers, the Pedicab Committee scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday (the 8th) to formally discuss it.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Convened Spring General Membership Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association sent a notice to all members yesterday: "We are writing to inform you that the Association has scheduled a spring general membership meeting for 2:00 PM on Sunday, April 19th, at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Tibet Road. The meeting will include the re-election of officers. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, we are sending this letter to inform you. We hope you will take note of this and attend the meeting on time for discussion. Furthermore, members who have not paid their regular fees for more than 12 months will be notified by letter to pay their outstanding fees before April 12th.

This is a combined notice."</p>

<p>Sun Bolan's deeds have been seen in various newspapers, and the people of the country know them all. For the past five or six years, he has been recuperating in Shanghai, and he has devoted his remaining energy to social undertakings, especially caring for his hometown. The association's affairs are thriving, all thanks to Sun Gong's guidance. Now that he has suddenly passed away, it is not only a major loss to the association but also a major loss to the country and society. Therefore, the association has specially initiated a memorial service to commemorate his achievements.

<h3>Shanghai Audit Office Concurrently Handles Audits of China Merchants Bureau and Two Railway Bureaus</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in order to promote the audit system, the Audit Department of the Control Yuan, in addition to establishing audit offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Shanghai, and establishing an office in the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, now intends to add audit offices in Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Sichuan in the current year. Public agencies and publicly owned businesses that are not directly under the central government of the provinces and cities, such as the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, are also planning to add offices. However, for the sake of prudence and frugality, it is proposed that the audit offices in Shanghai and Hubei Province concurrently handle the audit affairs of the China Merchants Bureau, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, and the Ping-Han Railway Bureau on a provisional basis. This has been submitted to the Control Yuan for transfer to the Executive Yuan for approval and ordered to be implemented. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau and the China Merchants Bureau have now received orders and are consulting with the Shanghai Audit Office on the procedures. At the beginning of the year, the office will send personnel to be stationed at each bureau to handle the audit affairs.</p>

<h3>Insurance Documents of Chinese Merchants Should be Based on Chinese Text, Ministry of Industry Replied to the Machinery Industry Federation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Domestic Goods Factory Federation previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry to stipulate that Chinese be the standard for insurance policies of Chinese merchants. The Ministry of Industry and the Legislative Yuan replied yesterday. The reply from the Ministry of Industry is recorded as follows: "It is reported that the insurance policies used by the Chinese merchant insurance industry should be based on Chinese. Please forward the report to the Executive Yuan and order the Legislative Yuan to include the clause in the Insurance Law when deliberating and enacting it. The report has been received. It is found that the Insurance Law was promulgated by the National Government on December 30 of the eighteenth year and July 5 of the twenty-fourth year. There is no need to forward the proposed amendment. However, the insurance policies used by the Chinese merchant insurance industry still do not comply with the order to use Chinese as the main language, which is indeed inappropriate. In addition to returning the original sub-report, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau is ordered to strictly order the Insurance Industry Association to comply with the order immediately and not delay. This is a reply for information." The previous letter from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan stated: "We are writing to inform you that the President of the Yuan issued a document stating that the clauses listed on the insurance policies of the Chinese merchant insurance industry all have the word 'English shall prevail.' Please correct this when deliberating and enacting the Insurance Law, etc. It was ordered that the report be received. In addition to submitting it to a member committee of the Legislative Yuan for preparation, you should submit a request to the competent authorities. In addition to sending this letter, we are sending this letter for your information."</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Replied to Municipal Federation, Agreed to Ban Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Transferred to Municipal Government for Approval</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Union of this city previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting assistance in banning dance halls. Yesterday, it received a reply from the Council: "We are writing to inform you that we have received your letter stating that the operation of dance halls in this city has developed abnormally, causing harm to customs and public order in minor cases, and even more likely to ruin the country's lifeline and lead to the tragedy of national subjugation and racial extinction in major cases. You requested that we find a way to ban them. We agree that dance halls poison society and harm people and should be banned to maintain morality. In addition to forwarding this to the Municipal Government for approval, we are sending this letter in reply."</p>
<h3>Tongqiao Township Improvement Association in Shanghai County Implemented Ancestral Worship Reform</h3>
<p>The Tongqiao Township Improvement Association in Shanghai County is a guided organization of the Zhuanqiao People's Education Museum. In order to improve customs and promote culture, the association formulated methods for improving ancestral worship and submitted them to the county government for record and implementation. More than 80 households in the district, including Zhu Jingqing and Zhang Huosheng, have joined the organization and sworn to implement the methods. Yesterday was the Cold Food Festival, and each household held a spring ancestral worship ceremony in accordance with the resolution of the improvement meeting. Each family prepared four dishes of local cuisine, and the furnishings were simple. The etiquette was very solemn, and there was little interaction with friends and relatives. Zhang Yunsheng, Lu Yiyu, Yu Wenhuan, and other supervisors of the association inspected various villages and provided on-site guidance. Supervisor Zhang of the county Party headquarters also visited once and praised it.</p>
<h3>News of Merchant Ship Accidents</h3>
<p>"Bei An" Crew Rescued</p>
<p>After the "Bei An" ship of the Northern Shipping Company ran aground off Hainan Island, the Shanghai branch of the Northern Shipping Company received confirmation yesterday that all crew members were rescued by the customs ship "Hai Ping" and taken to Haikou, Qiongzhou. A group telegram is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>"Bei Kang" Collided with Wharf</p>
<p>The "Bei Kang" ship, with a load of 1,015.26 tons, a length of 207 feet and 7 inches, a width of 29 feet and 6 inches, and a draft of 9 feet and 6 inches, also belongs to the Northern Shipping Company. It originally sailed the Shanghai-Tianjin route. This time, it loaded coal in Qinhuangdao and transported it to Jiangyin. As soon as it finished unloading the coal at the Kaijian Wharf and was leaving the wharf, it suddenly collided violently with the wharf's floating bridge. The extent of the damage has not yet been reported in detail.</p>
<p>Details of "Tai Shun" Incident</p>
<p>Lou Changqing, the shipowner of the China Merchants Bureau's "Tai Shun" ship, reported to the Bureau that the "Tai Shun" sailed from Xiamen to Shanghai empty. The northeast wind was very strong. When the ship reached the Dodl Island Lighthouse, the wind became even stronger, and the ship could not move forward. Even at full speed, it could not break through the raging waves, and the ship's hull was shaking violently. For safety, it anchored in Lian Bay to avoid the wind. At 9:00 AM the next morning, the wind and waves became even stronger. The first and second sections of the thick iron chain of the huge anchor on the left were broken by the wind and waves. The anchor, weighing two tons, and the chain both fell into the sea. Fortunately, the right anchor was quickly raised, preventing the ship from being overturned by the waves. At this time, it was impossible to stay anchored in the strong winds and waves, so it risked returning to Xiamen. The wind stopped at noon on the third day, and it started sailing to Shanghai again. The loss of the anchor is worth a great deal. A surveyor has inspected the ship and will install a new anchor and chain.</p>
<h3>Liu Xi's and Wu Wenxiang, Adultery Case Amended to One-Year Sentence</h3>
<p>No Right of Appeal, Sent to Prison for Execution</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The adultery case of Shanghai young mistress Liu Xi's and chauffeur Wu Wenxiang was judged by the Shanghai District Court. Wu Wenxiang was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Wu, dissatisfied, appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court has completed the trial, rescinding the original judgment and changing the sentence to one year in prison. The judgment has been delivered yesterday. Because this case is a second instance trial, Wu has no right of appeal and has been sent to prison for execution. The text of the judgment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court Criminal Judgment, (Year 24 Shang Zi No. 1590): Appellant Shanghai District Court Prosecutor, Wu Wenxiang, male, 23 years old, native of Chuansha County, residing at No. 44 Kangle Village, Foch Road, Shanghai, profession: chauffeur, chosen defender: Lawyer Dong Banggan. The above appellant, Wu Wenxiang, due to a case of obstructing marriage and family, was dissatisfied with the first instance judgment of the Shanghai District Court on January 18, Year 25 of the Republic of China and filed an appeal. The original trial prosecutor also filed an appeal because the original judgment was deemed inappropriate. This court's trial judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: The original judgment concerning Wu Wenxiang is revoked. Wu Wenxiang is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for continuous adultery with a married person. The remaining parts are acquitted.</p>
<p>Facts: In the seventh month of the lunar calendar in Year 22 of the Republic of China, Wu Wenxiang was a chauffeur at the home of Liu Zirong on Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai. Liu Zirong liked to drive himself and often left the chauffeur at home. Wu Wenxiang, therefore, had the opportunity to get close to Liu Zirong's wife, Liu Xi's, and gradually committed adultery. Liu Zirong was initially unaware. In the seventh month of Year 24, Wu Wenxiang was dismissed due to an incident. Liu Xi's suddenly left a suicide note on August 2 of the same year and eloped, cohabiting with Wu Wenxiang in a small room at No. 84 Jixiangfang, Qianjiatang. Liu Zirong found out and reported to the police, who arrested them on December 2 of the same year and sent them to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor for investigation. Based on Liu Zirong's accusation, Wu Wenxiang was prosecuted for the crime of adultery with a married person.</p>
<p>Reasons: The appellant Wu Wenxiang's adultery with Liu Xi's has been confessed without denial, which is consistent with Liu Xi's statement to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau that she had been living with Wu Wenxiang for two years. They were arrested on the spot while cohabiting in the small room in Jixiangfang after Liu Zirong reported to the police. The accuser Liu Zirong also testified in court. The appellant's continuous adultery has been proven beyond doubt. Since the husband has accused, the crime should be judged according to the law. However, Liu Xi's elopement was not the result of enticement by the appellant. The original trial prosecutor did not prosecute this. Based on Liu Xi's statement to the Public Security Bureau that she left on her own and was not enticed, and the appellant's statement that "I originally lived on Yidingpan Road, Liu Xi's wanted me to move, so I moved to Jixiangfang, and I repeatedly advised Liu Xi's to go home, but she didn't listen," it is evident that the appellant's cohabitation with Liu Xi's was passive and there was no act of enticement. It is difficult to hold him responsible for the crime of enticement. The original trial failed to observe this and wrongly believed that the appellant had committed the crime of enticing a married person to leave their family, in addition to the crime of adultery, and should be punished according to Article 240, Paragraph 3, and Article 239 of the Criminal Law, following Article 55 to punish the more serious crime. This is a mistake. The appellant's argument that the original judgment inappropriately sentenced him for the crime of enticement is not without reason and should be revoked and amended by this court. Considering that the appellant has committed adultery for several years, the crime is continuous, and the sentence should be increased by one-half according to the proviso of Article 56 of the Criminal Law, and he should be sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Although the enticement part is not within the scope of the prosecution, the judgment should still acquit that part because the trial result does not consider the enticement crime as a means of committing adultery. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment is made according to Article 361, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 245, Article 56, Article 239 of the Criminal Law, and Article 356, Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, as stated in the main text. Zhu Jun, the prosecutor of this court, attended the court to perform the duties of the prosecutor.

<h3>Xu Qizhong's Bankruptcy: Creditors File Private Prosecution for Wastefulness</h3>
<p>Borrowing 1,000, Writing a 10,000 IOU is Not a Legitimate Debt</p>
<p>Buying Cosmetics Extravagantly, How Can This Be Explained?</p>
<p>Old Man Refuses to Repay Debts, Belongings Publicly Auctioned</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of Xu Guannan, a wealthy merchant from Wuxing, residing at No. 61 North Zhejiang Road, north of Old Garbage Bridge, was originally from a well-to-do family. However, due to arbitrary squandering, he accumulated a mountain of debts and applied to the court for bankruptcy. Creditors such as Sincere Company, Xintong Automobile Company, Shihe Jewelry Company, Jinlong Hotel, and Ms. Hu Meiying, who was owed money, jointly hired Lawyer Yue Junwei to file a criminal private prosecution against Xu in the First Special District District Court. They detailed Xu's extremely luxurious, romantic, and decadent actions over the years, stating that he had committed crimes under Articles 154 and 156 of the Bankruptcy Law, requesting that he be punished according to the law and ordered to repay the debts owed. The court had summoned the defendant to appear in court for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the court for trial. The defendant Xu Qizhong arrived with two defense lawyers. The plaintiffs were not all present. Lawyer Yue represented the prosecution, briefly stating that the defendant's application for bankruptcy had been approved by the court on January 22 of this year, and accountant Wang had been appointed to investigate the accounts. This case is prosecuted based on the Bankruptcy Law. For example, if the defendant owed the madam of the Wendi brothel, Ying Huizhen Hall, 1,000 yuan for expenses, he gave a 10,000 yuan IOU, a difference of 9,000 yuan. He admitted at the first creditors' meeting that this was a disposition unfavorable to the creditors, violating the provisions of Article 154 of the Bankruptcy Law. As for the crime of wastefulness under Article 156 of the same law, it can be proven by the bill from Sincere Company. From April of the year before last to June of last year, in just one year and one month, he purchased goods from Sincere on credit worth over 4,240 yuan. Currently, excluding the returned goods, he still owes over 2,650 yuan. The goods purchased included as many as 334 types. The first purchase included as many as 33 types, and cosmetics accounted for almost half. The second purchase was even worse. Other debts owed to Hongxiang Company, Gaohe Women's Shoe Store, Shihe Jewelry Store, Yiyuan Furniture Company, Jinlong Hotel, St. Anna Dance Hall, Dasha Automobile Company, and Zou Juxing Clothing Store were all for wastefulness. The extravagant and dissolute events were too numerous to mention. When questioned, the defendant Xu Qizhong stated that he was in too much debt and could not repay it, so he applied for bankruptcy. The debt owed to Ying Huizhen was not for expenses but was cash borrowed successively. The actual amount was only 1,000 yuan, but three IOUs were written, totaling 10,000 yuan. When the 1,000 yuan IOU was written, he actually received 200 yuan. When the 4,000 yuan IOU was written, he actually received 300 yuan. Finally, when the 5,000 yuan IOU was written, he actually received 500 yuan. I have never had a job. All previous expenses were provided by my father. The debts I owed were also repaid by my father (referring to his father). Therefore, everyone was happy to lend me money or let me purchase goods on credit. In recent years, with the decline in real estate value and the failure of other businesses, my father stopped repaying my debts. I have no property. The car, refrigerator, and other items were all bought by my father. Since the bankruptcy was approved, I have handed over these items. Judge Wu stated that the case still requires investigation of evidence and ordered a postponement to April 16 in the afternoon for further questioning. It is also heard that the creditors of Xu, after the first creditors' meeting, have scheduled a second creditors' meeting for the 10th of this month to discuss everything. As for the assets handed over by Xu, they have also been scheduled for a public auction next Tuesday by the only auction house. However, the car, radio, and refrigerator will not be included in the auction on that day.</p>
<h3>Eurasia No. 15 Flew a Sightseeing Flight Yesterday</h3>

<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 15 Junkers giant aircraft, which flew the first flight on the Shaanxi-Yunnan route on the 1st of this month, returned to Shanghai on Friday the 5th of last week. Because the internal machinery needed to be dismantled and inspected, it was left in Shanghai for inspection at the Longhua Aircraft Factory. The second flight on the Shaanxi-Yunnan route was changed to be flown by Aircraft No. 17. The inspection was completed yesterday morning. At 12 noon, a test flight was conducted at Longhua, and the results were satisfactory. Then, at 2 pm, a sightseeing flight was operated. It took 15 minutes to fly around the city once before landing.

<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Strictly Prohibit Pedestrians from Walking Along the Tracks or Bridges</h3>
<p>To Avoid Being Run Over, Falling into the Water, and Other Dangers</p>
<p>Sending Letters to County Governments for Earnest Announcement</p>
<p>Datong News Agency: Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Railway Bureaus, sent letters to the county governments along the railways, stating that the Railway Traffic Safety Committee reported that recently, traffic accidents have occurred frequently along the railways, resulting in injuries and deaths. The cause is mostly that pedestrians take shortcuts and walk along the tracks or bridges, causing them to be unable to avoid the train in time, leading to accidents. The only way to prevent this is to request the county governments to announce to the residents within their jurisdiction that they must not take shortcuts at risk and avoid accidents. The railway tracks and bridges of our bureau are for trains to travel on. However, ignorant villagers often take temporary convenience, risking walking along the tracks or bridges, resulting in being run over or falling into the water and drowning. Although the disaster is self-inflicted, it is still pitiful. Our bureau has previously ordered the responsible departments to hang warning signs "Pedestrians Prohibited" on each bridge and to erect obvious text and picture signs at each traffic location to prevent this. However, accidents still occur and have not decreased. According to the previous situation, in addition to strictly ordering the relevant departments to strictly prohibit pedestrians from walking along the tracks or bridges, we should also send a letter to your government, requesting you to announce to the residents of each town and village along the railway within your jurisdiction, earnestly persuading them not to take shortcuts and walk along the tracks or bridges to avoid danger and value their lives.

<h3>Korean Man's Case of Forcing Wife with Mental Illness: Withdrawal of Arguments and Further Investigation of Three Points</h3>
<p>Whether Pan Jingwen Has Mental Illness, Have Experts Study the Prescription, Summon Key Witnesses</p>
<p>Kim Yushan, the Korean manager of the Golden Camel Fountain Pen Factory, married Pan Jingwen, a female doctor at the Hongkou Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, last winter. Not long after, the happy couple turned into a resentful couple. Pan accused Kim of having a new love, and Kim claimed that Pan suffered from mental illness, leading to mutual accusations. Recently, Kim instructed the Shanghai Mental Hospital at No. 7 Chunjiang Villa, No. 888 Kangnao Road, to transport Pan to the hospital by car under the pretext of treating her illness, imprisoning and abusing her. Later, Pan managed to escape and reported to the local police station, which sent detectives to arrest the hospital doctor Chu Jiqun, nurse Gao Xinkui, tea servant Yang Caigou, and Li Amao. They were taken to the First Special District District Court for questioning. The court ordered them to be released on bail pending sentencing. The original report stated that the case was originally scheduled to be sentenced yesterday morning. However, Judge Liu Yugui believed that whether Pan Jingwen has mental illness requires a forensic doctor to diagnose for a considerable period of time before it can be accurately determined, and it cannot be judged hastily. Although the prescription prescribed by Chu Jiqun stated that Pan suffered from mental illness, it must be sent to a specialist for research before it can be believed. Kim Yushan and key witness Gao Xinchong must be summoned for further investigation. Therefore, the judge announced in court the above three points that still need to be investigated when the police sent the four defendants to court yesterday morning, and then ordered the withdrawal of the conclusion of the arguments, awaiting a scheduled re-trial.</p>

<h3>Rogue "Little Anhui" Intends to Extort Money, Causing a Man to Have His Wrist Broken; Wu Jingting Seriously Injured Trying to Escape; Cousins Living Together, Not Siblings</h3>
<p>At No. 16 Jun'an Lane, near Xiaomu Bridge in Pudong, two people resembling a young couple rented the loft room some time ago. The man claimed to be named Wu Jingting, 22 years old, from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and working at New Ocean Trading Company. The woman was named Jinmei, only 17 years old. The two were extremely intimate, much like a newly married couple, so the residents did not suspect anything of their cohabitation. Unexpectedly, at about 10:30 last night, several rogues suddenly came to No. 16, insisting on meeting Wu Jingting in the loft room. They publicly claimed that Wu and Jinmei were committing incest as siblings. The neighbors who heard this knew that the rogues were intending to extort money, so they falsely claimed that Wu was not at home. At the time, Wu and Jinmei were about to go to sleep. Upon hearing this news, Wu Jingting became terrified. He pushed open the window of the loft room, climbed onto the balcony, and then tried to escape downstairs from the balcony. Who knew that he would carelessly lose his footing and fall, causing his left wrist to be broken, and his head and legs to be seriously injured. He immediately fainted and lost consciousness. The co-tenants heard the noise and rushed to see what had happened, and he was discovered. Jinmei also heard the news and came downstairs, embracing him and crying bitterly. At this time, the rogues, seeing that things were not going well, dispersed and fled. Afterwards, the co-tenants reported the incident to the police station and sent him to the nearby Jiren Hospital for treatment. After a while, he slightly regained consciousness. When asked about the origins of the two, Wu said that Jinmei was his cousin. Because they were fond of each other, they lived together, and they were not blood relatives. As for the rogues who were extorting money, the leader was named Shen Xiaomao, from Anhui, nicknamed "Little Anhui." The police station is currently hunting him down.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper's Car Drives onto the Sidewalk, Injuring Three Women; Victims Are Zhu Chen, Qiu Chen</h3>
<p>In front of the gate of the Yuantai Money Exchange, No. 989 Ari Lane, North Sichuan Road, at about 8:25 last night, a car from the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily was traveling north on North Sichuan Road from the south. At that time, a Yangzhou woman, Zhu Chen, 41 years old, was crossing the road at that location. The chauffeur, Jin Acai from Yangzhou, saw her and hurriedly tried to avoid her, but it was already too late. He ran over Zhu Chen's legs. Who knew that the chauffeur would not stop the car but turned the car to the right in a panic? The turn was too sharp, causing the car to drive onto the sidewalk, crashing straight into the Yuantai Money Exchange, overturning the counter, and injuring the legs of the owner's wife, Liu Chen, and a neighbor, Qiu Chen. There was a great commotion. The nearby patrolmen, upon hearing the news, arrested the chauffeur and impounded the car. They also sent the injured to Shanghai Nursing Home for treatment.</p>
<h3>Inland Fabric Factories Send Representatives to Shanghai to Petition for Exemption from Fabric Export Tax; Visiting the Director of the Consolidated Tax Bureau to Request Relief; If Not Resolved, All Will Be Shut Down</h3>
<p>Because the Consolidated Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in this city has removed the inspection station in Changshu, it is difficult for inland factory fabrics to be transported and sold. Special representatives have been sent to Shanghai to petition. The details investigated by the Dagong News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<p>Transportation and Sales Obstructed: The Consolidated Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in this city originally had an inspection station in Zhitang Town, Changshu, to handle the inspection and audit of tax revenue for the yarn factories in that area, and to handle the filling of forms for fabric factories. This year, because the yarn factories in that area are affected by the recession, they have not yet started work. The Consolidated Tax Bureau, in order to save expenses, has removed the inspection station in Changshu. Over eighty fabric manufacturers in the county are facing difficulties in filling out forms, transporting goods, and obstructed sales, causing the factories to have stockpiles of inventory that cannot be transported to Shanghai. If there is no proper solution, the raw materials will be cut off, and the factories will be forced to shut down.</p>
<p>Petitioning in Shanghai: In addition to convening a meeting to discuss solutions and requesting relief from the local party and government organs, the industry also publicly elected representatives Wang Guanqin and Wu Hongjie to come to Shanghai. Together with Wang Shaojun, a representative of the Shanghai fabric industry, they went to the Consolidated Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui on Baker Road in this city to petition. Director Jin Shengyi received them. After the fabric industry representative reported the difficulties in transportation and sales, they requested the bureau to exempt inland fabric from export tax and to facilitate the procedures for filling out transport forms. After negotiation, the bureau has agreed to do so.</p>
<h3>Military Commission Revokes the Confiscation of the Yuanxiang Steamer</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, stating that the provincial government had forwarded a telegram to your Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Yuanxiang steamer seized for transporting opium by its crew. Please order Wu and the district security commander to release it immediately. The security commander reported to the Chairman of the Military Commission. Directive No. 1660 of the Law Department on March 24, Year 25, stated that the contents of the report and enclosures are all known. The Wu and District Administrative Commissioner's Office of the province reported the case of Cai Atu and others transporting and selling opium. Regarding the confiscation of the Yuanxiang steamer, since the steamer is not owned by the defendants, the commissioner was instructed by directive No. 344 of the Law Department to revoke the confiscation and make corrections. Please be informed accordingly. I hereby inform you, hoping that your association will investigate and take note.</p>

First, Qian Yinsheng testified that on that day, Yang Yusheng led Song Quansheng and more than 30 others to seek revenge. Song Quansheng was the first to attack, hitting me on the head, followed by a violent chop to my left foot with a sharp axe. Yang Yusheng then opened fire. I was terrified and ran into the inner room to hide, avoiding being harmed. I don't know how Zhang Jinfa was shot and killed.

<h3>Stable Driver Stealing Oil Case: One Arrested, Two Wanted</h3>
<p>Wang Zhaosun, the manager of Yuda Transportation Company at the Shanghai South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, recently shipped 84 cans of tung oil and 43 cans of tea oil from Lanxi, Zhejiang, totaling 1,560 yuan, which were transferred from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway for joint transportation. When the train arrived at the South Station and unloaded the goods in the early morning, Yuda Company handed them over to Xu Zhengwei stable company to transport them to Yongchengyuan at Dama Road in the Public Concession. There were 84 cans of tung oil and 43 cans of tea oil from Shen Yuanlai. The stable drivers Qian Asi, Du Heshang, and Zhu Ruqi transported the goods but did not deliver them to the above-mentioned stores. They intended to sell them privately and secretly transported the tung oil and tea oil to a straw shed on Zhongshan Road, repackaging them into 11 wooden barrels, intending to peddle them. However, the scheme was discovered by Li Xiaozhi, the captain of the Detective Squad of the Fourth Sub-bureau, who immediately dispatched Detective Squad Leader Yu Ruhai and detectives Jin Yushan, Lü, Chen Mingsheng, etc., to wait at the intersection of Longhua Road and Xieqiao Road around 6:30 PM the night before.

The truck drivers were detained and taken to the Ximen Sub-bureau for interrogation. The Taiping truck driver confessed that Chen Changsheng, who lives at No. 1 Gongli, Dajilu, had called the truck to transport the goods.

They were ordered to reconcile out of court. Yesterday, they were summoned again. The plaintiff, Fan Qiushi, stated that the defendant did not send anyone to reconcile and requested that the lawsuit proceed. The judge asked when did you know that they were having a relationship after you married Fan Chunsheng. Qiushi replied that it was only recently, in September of last year, when her husband repeatedly made excuses to go out and not return home that she began to hear rumors. Fan Chunsheng confessed that he and Ban Jiuyan were cousins, and because his wife was infertile and had a penchant for vices, he had a relationship with his cousin Ban Jiuyan five years ago. The judge asked if your wife knew about it beforehand. He replied that she did, and they initially lived together, later moving to No. 6 Chunfu Lane, Avenue Foch (Note: This house is the property of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the plaintiff's lawyer, Zhang Deqin, is the legal advisor. Zhang can be asked to inspect the lease from the Industrial Bank to clarify). The judge asked if there was any written evidence of marrying Ban Jiuyan as a concubine, and whether guests were invited. Fan replied that there was no written evidence and no guests were invited, but relatives such as his brother-in-law Fan Jimin and cousin Fan Leshan knew about it beforehand and are also present to testify. Then, witnesses Fan Jimin and Fan Leshan were called to the stand, stating that Fan Chunsheng and Yin Jiuyan had a relationship five years ago. It was because Fan's father, Huichun, was eager for a grandson that Jiuyan was taken as a concubine. The judge asked if Fan Qiushi knew about it beforehand. They replied that they initially lived together, so she must have known. At this point, Fan Qiushi stated that their statements were completely inconsistent. She really did not know that her husband was having an affair with his cousin. Yin Jiuyan stated that she had a relationship with Fan Chunsheng for five years. When asked if Fan Chunsheng had thrown a banquet to take her as a concubine, and whether Qiushi knew, she replied that although there was no banquet, relatives knew, and Qiushi also knew. Her lawyer, Jiang Yiping, also defended everything, and stated that there was also a relative, Yao Xinzhi, who knew about this, and requested that he be summoned. Judge Chen Congsheng ordered a postponement until the morning of the 11th for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Broadcast Speech for Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Cai Jinjun</p>
<p>Dear compatriots and children, today is a very memorable Children's Day. The people of the whole country are holding enthusiastic celebrations for the children, who are the future masters of our country. Especially today, when the country is in serious trouble, I feel that this celebration is even more valuable. I, Jinjun, have been invited by the Shanghai Children's Year Implementation Committee to give a broadcast speech, and I am especially honored and pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the citizens of the city and the lively and lovely children. The topic of my speech today is "Cultivating Children to Succeed as Fighters for a Revitalized Nation." I feel that this is a very necessary and appropriate issue for saving the nation and ensuring its survival. As you all know, the position that children occupy in the country and nation is very important. Children are the future masters of the country. Children are the new life for the continued existence and development of the nation. Everyone has gone through childhood. The soldiers who are now fighting on the battlefield and the high officials who are making big plans were once lively and lovely children playing in kindergartens and primary schools. In other words, those who are now living a happy childhood are the heroes who will save the country and the people and revitalize the nation in the future. Therefore, if we want to save our endangered country and revitalize our nation, we must cultivate fighters who will fight for the revitalization of the nation, especially to cultivate children to succeed as fighters for the revitalization of the nation. Compatriots, we should cherish the future masters of our country. Dear children, you must accept the important task of being the masters and take on the work of saving the country and the people and revitalizing the nation. However, the life of children is innocent and carefree. The character of children is pure and flawless. The knowledge of children is like blank paper that has not yet been stained with ink, or like flowing water – it flows east if directed east, and flows west if directed west. During this period, when they can be good or bad, we must guide them onto the path of light and righteousness and cultivate them to become fighters for a revitalized nation. Then, those who have close relationships with the lives of children bear this important task. I feel that there are three types of people who have close relationships with children: first, the parents of the children; second, the teachers of the schools; and third, the police who are responsible as guides and nannies. I will now explain them separately:</p>
<p>Children have a very strong ability to imitate. All their words and deeds are modeled after the adults who are close to them. We often see that if parents love to read, their children also love to read; if parents love to gamble, their children also love to gamble; if parents have high morals, their children also talk about morality; if parents are addicted to smoking and drinking, their children are also addicted to smoking and drinking. This is a fact that society tells us. Taking the ancient sages as an example, if Mencius had not had his mother choose a good neighborhood and had been left to his own devices, I am afraid that he would not have been able to inherit Confucius's scholarship and become a great scholar of his generation. From this, we can see how important the responsibility that parents bear for the future of their children is.</p>
<p>The second is the school teacher. When children leave their parents and go to school, they have more opportunities to be close to their teachers. Children imitate the words and deeds of their teachers at all times. If the teachers are virtuous, the students will also be virtuous; if the teachers do evil, the students will also follow suit and do evil because they think that what the teachers do is right. Teachers are like molds for manufacturing goods. If the mold is not good, the manufactured goods will not be good. Therefore, it can be seen how great the influence of school teachers is on the cultivation of children.</p>
<p>The third is the police. Some of you may doubt what I am saying, but the reason is very simple. Didn't our revolutionary leader Chiang Kai-shek say that the police are the guides of the people and the nannies of education? This means that the police bear most of the responsibility for social education. All the evils of society are due to the poor performance of the police. In other words, all the progress of society is due to the proper measures taken by the police. Not only that, if the police can lead the people well and create a society with good manners and law-abiding citizens, then the children will also be polite and law-abiding because they are nurtured by this social environment. The direct influence of the police on children is really no less than that of school teachers. Don't we often see many children saluting and practicing police operations in the streets? And don't we often see many children playing games of police arresting bandits? A model policeman can enable the children in his jurisdiction to be protected and trained by him and to change their stubborn ways and improve their bad habits. In short, the parents of children, the teachers of schools, and the police who are responsible as guides and nannies all bear the responsibility of cultivating children. Parents bear the responsibility of family education, teachers bear the responsibility of school education, and the police bear the responsibility of social education. Therefore, to cultivate children to succeed as fighters for a revitalized nation, the three types of people mentioned above must all take responsibility. But let's examine ourselves. How many of the children, who are the future masters of our country, are living a happy life? How many are enjoying perfect education? They are often in a filthy living environment. They have no one to teach them, so when they grow up, they become unteachable and degenerate youths. What a pity this is! It is also a major reason for the poverty and weakness of the country and the decline of the nation. Dear compatriots, have you ever looked around at the situation in various countries around the world? Do you also know the international environment in which our country is located? The terrifying clouds of war have filled the whole world, and our nation is on the verge of collapse. It is not enough to rely solely on adults to save this precarious fate. We must cultivate the future masters of our country, the children, to succeed as healthy fighters, carrying hot blood and guns, and continuing to fight unceasingly. Only then can the national crisis be resolved, and the nation's revitalization be hopeful. Therefore, I dare to stand on the position of the country and the nation and give urgent and loyal advice to the parents, school teachers, and police who are responsible as guides and nannies of children throughout the city and even the whole country: First, we must recognize the current environment of our country and the heavy responsibility that we bear for children. Second, we must take the revitalization of the nation as the premise, and all our words and deeds must conform to the norms of the New Life Movement and serve as a model for children. Third, we must always stimulate children's interest in learning and enable children's intellectual, moral, and physical education to improve day by day. In particular, we should tell them inspiring stories about the country and the nation and awaken their sense of cherishing the country and the nation, so that the children of the whole country will succeed as fighters who will continue to fight for the revitalization of the nation. Only in this way will today's commemoration be valuable. Dear children, today is your day of commemoration. Do not let this precious childhood time slip away in vain. Remember that you are the future masters of the country, and you are shouldering a mountain-like responsibility on your little shoulders. Would you like to hear a story? Now I will tell you a few stories that can serve as models for children. The first is Kong Rong, who knew etiquette. When he was four years old, his father sent him some pears and asked him to share them with his brothers. As a result, he gave the big ones to his brothers and took a small one for himself. His father asked him why he didn't take a bigger one. He said that he was young and should take a small one, and that his brothers were older and should be given big ones. What an etiquette-conscious child he was! That is why he was able to become famous later. I hope that you will also be as etiquette-conscious as Kong Rong. The second is Sima Guang, who smashed the jar to save a girl. He had been the prime minister of the Song Dynasty. When he was a child, he was playing with other children in the courtyard. One child accidentally fell into a jar full of clear water. The other children were at a loss and afraid that disaster would befall them, so they ran away. Sima Guang was moved by righteousness and his wisdom arose in his heart. He picked up a stone and smashed the jar, saving the little friend who was on the verge of death. What a chivalrous thing this was! Do you have such a sense of righteousness? The third is Liang Hong, who lived in poverty and kept to his own. He was from the Eastern Han Dynasty. When he was a child, his family was very poor, and even the fire for cooking was a problem. Therefore, his neighbor felt sorry for him and asked Liang Hong to move his pot to his stove to cook. The neighbor thought that Liang Hong would be very happy, but Liang Hong politely refused. Liang Hong said that he could not use his fire without paying. Children, Liang Hong was able to live in poverty and keep to his own, and not enjoy things that were not his due. What an honest act this was! You should all follow his example. Do not take even the slightest bit of what is not yours. The fourth is Wang Qi, who sacrificed himself to wash away the national humiliation. Wang Qi was a child of the State of Lu in the Spring and Autumn Period. During the reign of Duke Ai of Lu, the State of Qi attacked Lu. Wang Qi was very angry and ashamed that the national crisis was not avenged. Therefore, he sacrificed himself to save the country, wielding his sword to kill the enemy, and eventually sacrificing himself for the country. Although he died, his name will forever remain in the minds of the people. How glorious it is! Dear children, do you also know about national humiliation? Do you also know about the national crisis? Please stir up your boiling blood and take Wang Qi as your model! Dear children, in these days of national crisis, do not let down the hopes of the people of the whole country for you. First, you must accept the training of your parents, teachers, and police. Second, you must study hard to improve your knowledge and skills. Third, you must have the idea of loving and protecting the country and the nation. Fourth, you must practice the New Life Movement. Fifth, you must strengthen your bodies and be as knowledgeable of etiquette and righteousness as Kong Rong and Sima Guang, and as knowledgeable of integrity and shame as Liang Hong and Wang Qi, and cultivate yourselves into healthy fighters for a revitalized nation. This is what I hope for you today, and I wish you boundless happiness.</p>

Presidium: Mayor Wu, Director Pan, Director Wu (representing Zhang Binghui), Director Cai, Director Z傘, Director Xu (representing Wang Miao), Jiang Jianbai, Yang Xiaotian, Hu Shuyi, Xing Wan, Chen Tiesheng.

Then, the mayor met with the children's representatives and distributed souvenirs, followed by various performances. The meeting was adjourned around 4:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Mayor Wu, the chairman, said in his speech, "Dear little friends, today is Children's Day, and we are all here to celebrate, which makes us very happy. The reason why the National Government wants to designate this year as Children's Year is to expand and popularize the promotion of Children's Day, because today's children are the future masters who will bear the heavy responsibility of the country in the future, and their position is very important, so we must awaken the people of the whole country, the parents of the whole country, and the whole society to pay attention to the problem of children. The most important issues for children are education, health, and thought. Our government, society, and parents should take the problem of children as the most important work for revitalizing the nation. In the past, parents considered children to be the private property of a family, and did not ask about the problems of children's education, health, and thought, as well as the relationship between children and society, country, and nation. They completely educated and raised children according to their personal likes and dislikes and personal methods, and did not care whether it was beneficial or harmful to the nation. We are living in today's world, and this kind of concept must be fundamentally eliminated. Children are not the private property of one family or one surname. The problem of children is the problem of the country and society. Today's parents must plan for the education, physical exercise, and intellectual enlightenment of children for the sake of the country's prosperity, the nation's revitalization, and the happiness of society. In the past, few people paid attention to the problem of children, because in the past, people thought that the rise and fall of the country and nation were the business of a small number of people, not the business of the entire people. Therefore, the country sometimes prospered and sometimes declined. The reasons for the prosperity and decline of the country can be seen in thousands of years of Chinese history. Whenever the right people were obtained, the country prospered, and whenever the wrong people were obtained, the country declined. Of course, whether or not the right people were obtained is very important, but we cannot hand this responsibility over to a few people. On the one hand, the country must be governed by the right people, and at the same time, every citizen must be responsible, so that the country will prosper. If every citizen is to be directly and indirectly responsible, they must possess various conditions. Looking at the history of ancient China and foreign countries, there are many countries that have been able to be restored after they were destroyed, and there are also countries that have not been able to be restored. The reason is that the nation can or cannot possess the conditions for establishing a country. Germany after the Great War has been able to breathe a sigh of relief in the world today and become a strong country, which is an example of this. China has a history of four thousand years, four hundred and fifty million people, and a vast territory and abundant resources, but it is weakening day by day. Although it has not been destroyed, its future is very dangerous. Saving the country is not a simple task that can be done by a few people in a day or two. It requires long-term struggle and the continuous efforts of the whole people, so that generations can inherit and continue to bear the responsibility of building the country. The problem of children is the central problem of the nation, so Children's Day must be widely promoted so that the whole society pays attention to it. The meaning of Children's Year and Children's Day lies in this. The majority of children who come to participate in the ceremony today are children who have the happiness and opportunity to receive education. We must not forget the many children in society who have no opportunity to receive education and have no parents, especially the disabled children. There is a school for blind children in Hongqiao, Shanghai, which enables disabled children to receive knowledge. Today there is a fundraising campaign to awaken the citizens of Shanghai to not only pay attention to the problem of children, but also to help disabled children."</p>
<p>Speeches by Party and Government: Xing Wan, representative of the City Party Department, said in his speech, "I hope that all the children can develop in all aspects like trees, and become the beams and pillars of houses, and the sleepers of railways. I hope that everyone will have a healthy body, so that they will have a healthy spirit and do great things. When the country is in trouble, the whole country will be mobilized, and children must also exert their abilities." Then, Director Pan gave a brief speech, congratulating the children on their health.</p>
<p>Children's Reply: Jiang Baoli of He'an Primary School, a children's representative, said in his reply, "Ladies and gentlemen, little friends, I just heard many words of encouragement and expectation, and I also saw today's grand meeting. I feel very happy and honored that all parties attach importance to children. Children's status in society has always been looked down upon, and they themselves did not know the importance of their responsibilities. Since the phrase 'Children are the future masters' was created, there has been a great change in society to attach importance to children, and children's undertakings have also been increasing day by day. In addition to being grateful for the enthusiasm of people in the community, we must first understand our own responsibilities, study knowledge, cultivate morality, and train our bodies to become healthy citizens, so that we will not let down the expectations of people." Next, Chen Shouhua of Danhua Primary School and Li Jin of Huacheng Cigarette Factory, a representative of labor children, and Weng Wenzhao, representative of the Xihu Children's Travel Group, replied in turn. Li Keng sang the Morning Meeting Song. Mayor Wu specially distributed a schoolbag to each representative as a souvenir.</p>
<p>Meeting with Representatives: Next, Mayor Wu met with the children's representatives, including Pan Fumei, Wang Ruiqia, Liu Yousheng, Shu Xizhi, Luo Qinghe, Da Cong, Zhu Qikun, Zhu Xingmei, Qiu Fuyue, Shan Bingkun, and others, totaling fifteen people. Each person went up to the command stand and saluted the mayor. Mayor Wu also shook hands with each of them and asked them simple questions, and gave each children's representative a schoolbag.</p>
<p>Performance Situation:</p>
<p>Around 10:00 AM, two aircraft from the Aviation Association performed on the field, flying high and low and making various postures, and distributing leaflets. The audience applauded thunderously. Next, the Garrison Headquarters machine gun performance made various combat actions, which was quite able to encourage the children's martial spirit. Then, the pyramid of Chongxin Primary School, the national art of the He'an Primary School, and the parallel bars of the Qiu Jiang Primary School were also quite exciting. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Chinese team played a South soccer performance, judged by Hu Zongfan. As a result, with a score of two to zero, the Chinese team won. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau's fire drill performed various high jumps, rope climbing, fire, rescue, and five fire trucks were dispatched, and the fire was extinguished in an instant, and the injured were rescued, which was most welcomed by the audience.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Souvenirs: Those who distributed souvenirs to the venue yesterday included the Children's Savings Bag of the Enterprise Bank, the schoolbag of the China Bookstore, the Children's Bookstore, and the Commercial Press, the souvenir album of the Shen Bao, a large number of pencils from the China Pencil Factory, Mayor Wu gave two commemorative pencils to each person, Director Pan gave a copy of the Children's Morning News to each person, and bread and water leaves at noon were distributed by the Organizing Committee, and the airplane leaflets were donated by the Happiness Association.</p>
<p>Vehicle Price Reduction: Yesterday, all public buses operating in the Chinese area gave half-price preferential treatment to children, and trams charged half price for fares above 8 cents, and full price for fares below 8 cents, which was never implemented in previous Children's Days. Other shops also gave a general price reduction for children's products to give preferential treatment to children.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcasting: All radio stations in the city, such as the Municipal Government, Da Zhonghua, Yamei, Dalu, Zhongxi, Dongfang, Foyin Huamei, Guohua, Hangye, Xinxin, Fuyin, Li Shudetang, Shanghai, etc., broadcast special Children's Day programs, and Mayor Wu, Director Shen, Secretary-General Yu, Director Xu, Director Cai, Director Wu, Director Li, Zhang Binghui, Wu Kaixian, Hu Shuyi, Tong Xingbai, Jiang Huaisu, Anti-Tuberculosis Association, etc., went to various stations to give speeches.</p>
<h3>China Bank Republic of China Twenty-Fourth Annual Business Report - Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of China Bank, Report to the Shareholders' Meeting</h3>
<p>Currency System and Finance</p>
<p>In the autumn of the twentieth year of the Republic, the abandonment of the gold standard by countries such as Britain, India, and Japan was followed by the devaluation of the US dollar in the twenty-second year, leading to a sharp rise in the value of our currency. By the summer of the twenty-third year, the US had implemented a silver purchasing policy, further increasing the price of silver. China's international balance of payments had long been in deficit, yet foreign exchange rates continued to rise sharply, resulting in deflation. Observing the Shanghai commodity price index falling from 129.2 to 99 between the twentieth and twenty-third years of the Republic, one can see the extent of its impact.</p>
<p>Since the twenty-third year of the Republic, a large amount of silver has flowed out of the country, and the silver reserves of banks have decreased. Not only have prices fallen sharply, but there has also been a trend towards financial panic. The government, therefore, announced in mid-October of that year the imposition of a 10% tax on silver exports and an equalization tax to remedy the situation. Since then, although the silver standard was maintained domestically, the foreign exchange rate had already broken away from its inherent relationship with the overseas silver price, causing the foreign exchange rate to find its own path of fluctuation. However, when changes were frequent and drastic, the government often sought ways to stabilize it, which was not without effect.</p>
<p>The government's policy of levying silver export taxes and equalization taxes was clearly a temporary expedient to meet the immediate needs and allow for a long-term consideration of a fundamental solution. Although prices did not fall immediately after implementation, the government ultimately recognized the severity of the problem: it deeply worried that high foreign exchange rates would inevitably hinder export trade, leading to increased domestic deflation. Conversely, if the foreign exchange rate fell, the disparity between the exchange rate and the overseas silver price would widen, and large-scale smuggling would inevitably arise. Moreover, at that time, paper currency was still under the convertibility system. If smuggling reduced silver reserves and undermined credit, it would inevitably lead to deposit withdrawals and runs, affecting the entire nation's finances to a significant extent.</p>
<p>By the twenty-fourth year, world silver prices continued to rise, and financial panic became even more severe. At the beginning of the year, although the government relied on the adjustment of equalization taxes to balance the rise and fall of the national currency's silver value, the fluctuating tax rates caused public anxiety. The authorities then went further and entered into a "gentleman's agreement" with Chinese and foreign banks, promising not to export silver. However, by that time, the amount of silver reserves had already been greatly reduced, and the national currency's silver value far exceeded the foreign exchange rate, leading to a resurgence of hoarding and smuggling, further depleting silver reserves.</p>
<p>At that time, because the national currency's silver value far exceeded the foreign exchange rate, the market speculated that the government would follow foreign countries in devaluing the currency. Although the government repeatedly declared that it would never adopt devaluation or other similar policies to provide relief, public anxiety remained unchanged. The parity difference between the foreign exchange rate and the overseas silver price, and the difference between near-term and forward exchange rates, continued to increase, all indicating that the path ahead for the currency system was fraught with thorns. The following table, listing the parity difference between the Shanghai foreign exchange rate and the London silver price, can illustrate its general situation.</p>
<p>Deflation and silver scarcity led to strong spot exchange rates. The general public, concerned about the future of the currency system and filled with doubts, made forward exchange rates even weaker. The difference between them sometimes reached an annual interest rate of 3%. With such high profits, funds originally intended for commercial use flowed into foreign exchange arbitrage. As a result, interbank lending rates rose, affecting all industries. Calls for relief were frequently heard. In addition, credit tightened, real estate stagnated, and short-term mortgages could not be repaid. What was once considered excellent collateral was now seen as a fearful thing. At the same time, Shanghai stock prices continued to fall, and trading was sluggish. All financial institutions tried to maintain stability, but they could only seek flexibility for themselves. As a result, the market situation deteriorated day by day, and the arrival of panic was imminent.</p>
<p>In this critical situation, the government increased its official shares in the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications at the end of March of the twenty-fourth year, so that the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications were linked and aligned, in order to achieve more effective control. The results were quite remarkable. By the summer, several small banks experienced liquidity problems. With the assistance of the three banks, the government prevented the crisis from spreading. However, the undermining of credit had not subsided. Before long, most money shops also urgently requested assistance, limiting withdrawals to 900 yuan per household. The government then established a Money Shop Supervision Committee to review the assets of 55 remittance money shops and estimate their value, as a standard for allocating government bonds for relief, allowing them to obtain government bonds to pledge to major banks for loans to facilitate turnover.</p>
<p>Since the loss of the Northeast, the northern border defenses had long been lax, and organized smuggling was rampant. Moreover, there was a concentration of cash withdrawals in Tianjin and Beijing, with paper currency being redeemed at a premium of 10% to 15% to absorb silver. In less than a month, the Bank of China alone had redeemed a huge amount of over ten million in silver. Ultimately, with the cooperation of the local bankers' association and chamber of commerce, and the support of the public, strict restrictions were imposed on cash withdrawals. Since then, paper currency in North China has effectively been on a non-convertible basis. Although holders of notes could not redeem silver for payment in transactions between North China and domestic and foreign ports, banks provided facilities for remittances to domestic and foreign ports. All transactions continued as usual. This trend is enough to shatter the common misconception that the people of North China are obsessed with the importance of coins. It also provides evidence that as long as the government can maintain credit and regulate it effectively, the public will be happy to accept paper currency and will not doubt the government's intention to implement monetary inflation policies to erode their savings.</p>
<p>Subsequently, at China's suggestion, the United Kingdom sought to send experts from the United States, Japan, France, and Italy to China to investigate and help stabilize the currency system. Most countries initially agreed, but in the end, only the United Kingdom declared its intention to send its economic advisor, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, to China.</p>
<p>At the end of April of the 24th year, Mexico recovered its silver currency to maintain its national currency system. At the same time, the United States slightly restricted silver purchases, and the world silver price temporarily fell. However, the state of financial insecurity in China did not abate slightly. Later, the situation in North China became turbulent, and the situation deteriorated, and the domestic debt market reacted even more strongly. At that time, rumors of currency devaluation were rampant, and speculation in foreign exchange and gold prices was rife. Legitimate businesses suffered considerable losses. Although penalties for smuggling silver were severe, where there is profit, people will inevitably go. Smuggling never ceased. The huge difference between spot and forward exchange rates, the extraordinarily high premium on drafts, and the extremely tight credit conditions were all obvious. Moreover, with falling prices, tightening credit, and the decline of industry and commerce, calls for currency inflation suddenly resurfaced.</p>
<p>By August, overseas silver prices had stabilized somewhat, and the market situation had slightly improved. However, after a short period of time, currency system rumors reappeared, and people rushed to buy foreign exchange. By mid-October, speculation in foreign exchange had become even more intense. By November 2nd, the exchange rate had fallen again by 17%. At the same time, gold prices rose from 900 to 1,160 yuan. Speculation and panic permeated the financial market, shaking the entire financial system. Therefore, on November 4th, the Ministry of Finance announced a new monetary policy.</p>
<p>Before announcing the policy, the government had carefully considered it and was convinced that nationalizing silver and adopting a foreign exchange standard were the only good strategies. The reason for the delay in issuing it was to obtain a large amount of foreign debt to reduce the risks of implementing the new monetary policy. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross came to China in September to investigate the economic situation, and in mid-October, the foreign exchange rate suddenly fell again, making it difficult to delay any longer and miss the opportunity. Therefore, the government had no choice but to resolutely implement this new policy immediately.</p>
<p>On November 3rd, the government announced the main points of the decree, stipulating that the paper currency issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be legal tender. Those holding silver standard currency or other silver currency could exchange it for legal tender within three months. Later, it was extended to six months. All grain payments, taxes, and all public and private debts could be settled in legal tender. Regarding the matters of issuance reserve funds and custody, an Issuance Reserve Management Committee was established to manage it. The committee was jointly organized by the Ministry of Finance and representatives from the financial and commercial sectors. In order to stabilize the legal currency at its current price for a long time, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications were ordered to buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. Furthermore, in order to implement this policy, it was planned to reorganize the Central Bank into a super-central reserve bank. Plans for reorganizing finances were also ready, and it was predicted that the national budget could be balanced in 18 months. In addition, a real estate mortgage bank was established, and existing laws were amended to make it easier to mortgage real estate and increase the liquidity of commercial bank funds.</p>
<p>The implementation of the new monetary policy surprised some people, who always believed that the old habit of the Chinese people attaching importance to coins meant this new policy might not be implemented. Unexpectedly, it was successful within three days after its implementation on November 4th. However, silver reserves in North China were kept by the Preparation Committee sub-branch. In Guangdong and Guangxi, not only was a separate reserve committee established, but the silver dollars previously circulating in the provinces were still used as the standard. Apart from Guangdong and Guangxi, legal tender was uniformly circulated everywhere. However, the important commodities therefore experienced speculation and surged once, but soon calmed down.</p>
<p>The success of this new monetary policy was due to many reasons. Before the reform, the monetary situation was extremely chaotic. People familiar with the matter knew that this was not an innovation. Moreover, after October 15th of the 23rd year of the Republic, the export of silver was effectively prohibited. In the five months preceding this, due to the patriotic initiative of the people of North China, they refrained from redeeming currency, gradually accustoming the people of North China to non-convertible paper currency. In addition, the cooperation of foreign banks and the permission of the British ambassador's decree greatly helped. If most foreigners and foreign institutions, under the protection of extraterritoriality, had engaged in obstruction, implementation would have been more difficult and confusing. Finally, the US government purchased 50 million ounces of our silver at US$0.65 per ounce, allowing the government banks to have sufficient foreign exchange reserves and to stabilize the exchange rate at the standard exchange rate when the new monetary policy was implemented.</p>
<p>It has been five months since the implementation of the new monetary policy. Although the silver price has fallen from about 29 and 5/16 pence per ounce to about 20 pence, not only is foreign exchange very stable, but domestic exchange, except for Guangdong and Yunnan, only charges a handling fee of one yuan per thousand yuan across provinces, and five jiao within the province. Moreover, the government has no intention of fixing the exchange rate of the national currency to any foreign legal tender. However, the current foreign exchange rate is now stable at a fair standard, which has increased exports and reduced imports. According to customs reports, this is a phenomenon that has not been seen in 60 years. As a result, credit is gradually restored, silver credit loosens, and commerce and industry become active.</p>
<p>If the foreign exchange rate can remain stable in the long term, and the situation in East Asia gradually eases, then the funds that have fled abroad in the past two years can be repatriated. If the world economy improves, China may be able to attract foreign investment again.</p>
<p>As to the success of the new monetary policy, some people think it is too early to say. They consider the sharp fall in the price of silver, the turmoil in foreign affairs, and the unbalanced budget as the main obstacles. When the price of silver even fell to a theoretical parity of 17 and 3/4 pence, it would have been very profitable to import silver into China. If the government had not sold a large amount of silver reserves in time, the foreign exchange rate might have been difficult to maintain in the future. However, the ratio of pure silver to pure gold has reached its lowest level in history, so there seems to be no need to worry about this. Others are concerned that any turmoil in the Far East will inevitably affect the currency system. However, no matter what difficulties any country encounters, no matter what currency system is adopted, it will inevitably be affected. However, the hope is that the value of our currency can return to the average price of the five years before the 23rd year of the Republic, and commodity prices will rise accordingly, coupled with the surge in export trade, which will improve the international balance of payments. However, given the occasional rise and fall of silver prices, and their impact on the domestic economy, if most countries did not believe that silver still had value in the currency system, then considering the restoration of the silver standard would be a major mistake. If the government can implement the measures taken when the new currency system was established, such as balancing the budget and establishing a central reserve bank, then the perfection of a sound monetary system is just around the corner, and the reconstruction of the national economy will benefit from it.</p>
<p>Last year, the financial sector in China was in a precarious position. Financial institutions had to be responsible for responding to the difficulties in the market on the one hand, and had to earnestly implement the monetary policy adopted by the government on the other hand. The task was difficult and strenuous, and there were frequent fears of failure. However, not only did the major domestic banks act in unison, but also the foreign banks provided sincere cooperation, which was very comforting. In the future, close cooperation between banks will become even more important. Who knows if the experience of the past year is a sign of a bright future?</p>
<p>Banking Business</p>
<p>The New Situation of the Bank: The tense situation and unrest in China's financial market last year have been briefly described above. Because the automatic elastic silver standard system has lost its effectiveness, and the progress of the monetary and financial system depends even more on the cooperation of banks, how to find ways to closely link the business of the major domestic banks is an urgent task. The government has long advocated granting special functions to the three banks with government capital, and at the same time formulating ways for them to cooperate with each other, in order to firmly establish a common financial policy for their implementation, and to seek the consolidation of the banking system, which was realized in March of last year. The government increased the bank's capital, so that the bank's capital increased from 25 million yuan to 40 million yuan, and the government shares accounted for half of the total shares. The number of directors was increased from 15 to 21, of which 9 were designated by the government, and the number of supervisors was also increased from 5 to 7, of which 3 were designated by the government. I was then appointed as the chairman of the bank's board of directors. Mr. Song Hanzhang, the managing director, has served in the bank for many years and has extensive experience. He was appointed as the bank's general manager to replace Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, who was reassigned as the deputy governor of the Central Bank. At the same time, the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications also underwent changes, and the result will be to make this bank pay special attention to the regulation of foreign trade and the business of international exchange banks that it has been engaged in in recent years.</p>
<p>Business Operations: In the past year, although the bank has been in a state of abnormal financial upheaval, and has been responsible for heavy duties, there are still several business developments that can be reported:</p>
<p>(1) Circulation of Exchange Coupons: This bank has always been important among issuing banks and has gained social credibility. Last year, the government implemented a new monetary policy and granted this bank's exchange coupons the qualification of legal tender. This bank increased the issuance of more than 80 million yuan last year, which was due to the government's wise decision to adopt the nationalization of silver, but at the same time, it can also show the position of this bank in the financial organization of China.</p>
<p>(2) Establishment of Overseas Agencies: Since the government specially authorized this bank as an international exchange bank in the 17th year of the Republic of China, it has been striving to promote the development of foreign trade and to support overseas Chinese. In addition to entrusting industry agents in important commercial centers abroad, it has also set up a management office in London and a branch in Osaka. Recently, it has felt that the time has come to set up additional agencies overseas. Because of the large number of overseas Chinese in the British Straits Settlements and the Nanyang Islands, and the prosperity of the tin and rubber industries, it has been decided to set up a branch in Singapore. It will also set up a management office in New York to increase trade and exchange convenience between China and the United States, and to contribute to the implementation of the government's new monetary policy. It is expected to be established in a few months.</p>
<p>(3) Establishment of Savings Department: In May of last year, in accordance with the provisions of the Savings Bank Law and with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, a Savings Department was established. Although the branches of this department are attached to the branches of this bank, a separate capital of 5 million yuan was allocated and independent accounting was adopted. The Savings Headquarters opened in Shanghai on June 1, and its branches were soon established in the branches of this bank.</p>
<p>(4) Construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: This bank has jointly invested with several domestic banks in the construction of the Hangzhou-Lanxi, Jinhua-Yushan, and Yushan-Nanchang sections of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Although the Yushan-Nanchang section has been completed this year, in order to connect the railway with the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and to support the economic development of the southeastern provinces, it is necessary to complete the Nanchang-Pingxiang section. Therefore, this bank was again entrusted by the Ministry of Railways last year to consult with various banks and the German Otto Wolff Company to assist in the extension of the railway. Under the same conditions as the construction of the Yushan-Nanchang section, the banking group agreed to lend another 10 million yuan in national currency, and the German company agreed to supply materials worth 10 million yuan in national currency in order to complete the Nanchang-Pingxiang section. The German company also promised to repay part of the loan for materials with Chinese products to help China's export trade. The banks involved in this matter, in addition to this bank, are the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, Jin Cheng, Xinhua, Yu Min, and the China Construction Bank Corporation and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau.</p>
<p>(5) Expanding Agricultural Lending: This bank continued to assist in the production and sales of agriculture last year. The year-end balance of agricultural loans reached 25,161,000 yuan, of which 510,000 yuan was lent to small farmers. The total amount lent to rural cooperatives throughout the year was 4,490,000 yuan, more than double that of the 23rd year, and the year-end balance was still 1,414,000 yuan. The lending area reached 9 provinces and 80 counties, including 26 cooperative federations, 2,814 cooperatives, and more than 126,000 farmers.</p>
<p>Assets and Liabilities</p>
<p>(A) Deposits</p>
<p>(1) Total Deposits: The total year-end deposit amount last year reached 766,291,628.25 yuan, an increase of 129,597,725.66 yuan compared to the 23rd year. It included: current deposits of 240,405,955.02 yuan, an increase of 57,549,917.83 yuan compared to the previous year; fixed deposits of 323,059,444.37 yuan, an increase of 71,175,110.79 yuan compared to the previous year; and interbank deposits of 202,826,238.86 yuan, an increase of 90,872,689.04 yuan compared to the previous year. This sharp increase in deposits was largely due to the highly volatile financial situation last year. This phenomenon was mostly due to public anxiety and the fact that peers wanted to use the increased deposits (an increase of more than 90 million yuan, as mentioned earlier) as a resource for their activities. This bank could not use them as much as usual.</p>
<p>(2) Number of Doubtful Accounts: The total number of depositors this year was 199,404, an increase of 29,204.</p>
<p>(3) Nature of Deposits: The percentage of the nature of deposits this year compared to the previous year is as follows:</p>
<p>(B) Loans</p>
<p>(1) Weaving Details: The total amount of doubtful loans at the end of last year was 489,071,104.34 yuan, an increase of 77,118,929.33 yuan compared to the previous year. It included: short-term loans and overdrafts of 236,824,379.59 yuan, an increase of 52,636,944.10 yuan; fixed-term loans of 207,046,389.17 yuan, an increase of 9,285,272.40 yuan; and discounts and purchases of term bills of 45,200,335.58 yuan, an increase of 15,196,712.83 yuan.</p>
<p>Short-term loans and overdrafts increased by 28.57% compared to the previous year, fixed-term loans increased by 4.69%, and discounts and purchases of term bills increased by 50.65%. Because there is no central discount bank and most of the working capital of banking peers is concentrated in this bank, if this bank seeks to fulfill its responsibilities to other financial institutions, it must maintain a large amount of liquid funds throughout the year. In the months before the implementation of the new monetary system, there was a frequent phenomenon of capital flight. In order to avoid the risk of unduly high pressure on foreign exchange, this bank felt that the policy of promoting the loosening of silver credit was not to be adopted.</p>
<p>(2) Nature of Loans: Last year's loans, classified by the purpose of the loan, increased compared to the 23rd year as follows: general commercial loans increased by 17.00%, industrial loans increased by 10.88%, transportation loans increased by 18.24%, and agricultural loans increased by 19.98%.</p>
<p>(C) Remittances</p>
<p>(1) Total Remittances: The total amount of remittances made by this bank last year was 1,020,153,000 yuan, an increase of 185,920,000 yuan compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>(2) Remittance Area: The percentage of the remittance area of this bank last year is as follows:</p>
<p>(D) Foreign Exchange: The total amount of foreign exchange business last year has greatly increased, but most of it belongs to the bills for adjusting import and export, and the total amount exceeds 70% compared with the 23rd year. The rest, such as letters of credit, domestic remittances, foreign currency bills, and the purchase of term bills, have all increased significantly.</p>
<p>(E) Issuance: At the end of the 24th year, the total amount of exchange coupons in circulation was 286,245,041.92 yuan, an increase of 81,531,576.51 yuan compared to the end of the previous year. The cash reserve was 201,152,244.85 yuan, accounting for 70.27%. The guaranteed reserve accounted for 29.73%, including securities worth 69,414,886.56 yuan, real estate worth 9,019,115.51 yuan, and the rest was the guaranteed reserve for the coupons led by various banks and stores.</p>
<p>(F) Securities: At the end of last year, the total amount of securities invested by this bank was 103,246,780.89 yuan, including 69,414,886.56 yuan for the guaranteed reserve for issuance and 33,831,894.33 yuan for business investment, accounting for 7.70% of the bank's total assets, an increase of 16,265,181.83 yuan compared with the total amount of 86,981,599.06 yuan in the 23rd year.</p>
<p>Profit and Loss</p>
<p>(1) Various Expenses: The total expenses of this bank last year were more than 7,249,000 yuan, an increase of more than 583,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year. The increase was mainly due to the expansion of business and the addition of institutions, but most of it was temporary expenditure with no continuity.</p>
<p>(2) Profit Distribution: The net profit for the 24th year was 3,602,357.98 yuan. After deducting 10% for the public reserve fund in accordance with the regulations, totaling 360,235.79 yuan, the remaining 3,242,122.19 yuan, plus the balance of 16,671.59 yuan carried over from the previous year, totaled 3,258,793.78 yuan. After deducting 2,239,726.03 yuan for the interest of official and commercial shares, the remaining 1,019,067.75 yuan was included in the retained earnings.</p>
<p>Overview of Savings Department Business</p>
<p>(1) Deposits: At the end of last year, the total amount of savings deposits was 43,140,027.91 yuan, including: current savings deposits of 22,011,464.55 yuan and fixed savings deposits of 21,128,563.36 yuan. The total number of deposit accounts was 75,864, including: 50,738 current depositors and 25,126 fixed depositors.</p>
<p>(2) Loans: At the end of the 24th year, the total amount of loans was 31,014,451.54 yuan. Among them, short-term loans were 4,857,711.91 yuan, accounting for 15.70% of the total loans; fixed-term loans were 15,761,592.91 yuan, accounting for 50.80%; securities investment was 8,056,847.70 yuan, accounting for 26.00%; interbank deposits were 347,194.17 yuan, accounting for 1.10%; and internal transactions were 1,991,104.85 yuan, accounting for 6.40%.</p>
<p>(3) Profit and Loss: The total expenses were 100,871.86 yuan. After offsetting the above amount and the interest paid with the interest received and other income, there was still a net profit of 97,711.82 yuan, which was included in the reserve fund.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade</p>
<p>According to customs reports, the total value of import and export trade in the 24th year was 1,495 million yuan, of which the net import value was 919,211,000 yuan, the net export value was 575,809,000 yuan, and the trade deficit was 343,402,000 yuan. The import and export values for the last three years are compared as follows (in millions of yuan):</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be observed that China's foreign trade has gradually improved in the past three years, mainly due to the continued decrease in the total value of imported goods. Exports, on the other hand, have remained relatively unchanged. Although the balance of China's foreign trade has superficially improved, it should be noted that the figures published by the customs cannot be regarded as accurate, because since the increase in import tariffs in recent years, smuggling has become rampant. The political disputes in the past year have further reduced the effectiveness of customs control over several important commercial ports. Although the amount of smuggled imports cannot be accurately estimated, it must be considerable.</p>
<p>Looking at the monthly total value of foreign trade in the last three years, imports have consistently fluctuated with the seasons, while exports have remained average throughout the year. The monthly total trade value last year was no different from the previous year.</p>
<p>The value of goods in the customs reports listed above is not sufficient as a basis for showing the growth or decline of China's foreign trade due to various reasons. Therefore, the quantity of various commodities shown in the customs reports from the 22nd to the 24th year is used to find the index of import and export cargo. The index of export cargo volume is obtained from the quantity of 14 commodities that accounted for 56.4% of the total exports in the 22nd year. The index of import cargo volume is obtained from the quantity of 13 commodities that accounted for 55.7% of the total imports in the 22nd year. The above cargo volume index and the foreign trade value index from the 22nd to the 24th year are listed below:</p>
<p>China's Foreign Trade Index from the 22nd to the 24th Year (based on the quantity of the 22nd year as 100%)</p>
<p>The rise and fall of foreign exchange and the prosperity or decline of foreign trade have always been of concern to the people of the country. However, the above figures cannot clearly show the degree to which recent drastic changes in foreign exchange have affected China's foreign trade. It can be said that last year's export trade was directly affected by foreign exchange. It is permissible to say that year-end inventories increased greatly compared to the same period in the 22nd and 23rd years.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade by Country</p>
<p>The total value of imports from the United States in the 14th year decreased greatly, but the United States still ranked first in China's import trade. Japan, with an increase in exports to China of 12,707,000 yuan, still ranked second. Germany actually replaced the United Kingdom and jumped to third place.</p>
<p>Last year, there was no major change in the order of China's export trade to various countries. The United States still ranked first. The value of goods exported to the United States increased by 41,975,000 yuan. Hong Kong, originally a transshipment center, fell from first place to second place, followed by Japan and the United Kingdom. France and Germany remained unchanged, but the value of goods imported from China increased greatly compared to previous years.</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that Japan was the only country with a significant increase in exports to China last year, with huge amounts of steel, machinery, fish, seafood, and sugar. Germany exported steel, machinery, and vehicles. French Indochina exported rice, increasing from 31,393,000 yuan in the 23rd year to 52,906,000 yuan. Australia exported wheat, flour, and wood, all of which increased compared to the previous year. Last year, the value of goods imported from the United States decreased by nearly 100 million yuan due to the sharp decline in cotton, wheat, and tobacco. The United Kingdom also decreased by 26,415,000 yuan due to the decline in exports of cotton cloth and machinery to China.</p>
<p>Last year, China's exports of tung oil, raw silk, seeds, and eggs to the United States, raw silk and peanuts to France, and cotton, tung oil, and antimony sand to Germany all increased significantly. Exports to India decreased by 1,816,000 yuan, to British Malaya by 2,562,000 yuan, and to Korea by 4,122,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade by Port</p>
<p>The percentage of import and export trade of China's major ports in the 23rd and 24th years in the total value of national foreign trade can be seen in the following table. However, these figures cannot be considered completely accurate due to the unresolved political disputes in various places and the prevalence of smuggling.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade by Port in the 23rd and 24th Years</p>
<p>Major Import and Export Commodities</p>
<p>Looking at China's major imported commodities last year, rice increased from 65,685,000 yuan in the previous year to 93,333,000 yuan, jumping from third place to first place. Minerals, which ranked first in the 23rd year, decreased by 2,900,000 yuan and fell to second place. Machinery and tools rose from fourth place to third place. Cotton fell from second place to fourth place.</p>
<p>Among China's exported commodities last year, metallic minerals, which ranked third in the previous year, ranked first. The total value of tung oil exports increased by 15,366,000 yuan compared to the previous year, jumping from sixth place to second place. Raw silk rose from seventh place to third place. Eggs and egg products remained in fourth place. Tea exports decreased by 6,457,000 yuan, falling from first place in the previous year to fifth place. Seeds increased by 13,836,000 yuan, rising from ninth place to sixth place.</p>

<h3>Four to Zero: Donghua Defeats Lux, Donghua B Forfeits to Western Merchant B, Western Capture A Forfeits Today</h3>

Donghua forfeited temporarily due to reasons, and Western Merchant won. The Group A match was between Donghua A and Lux. Donghua had previously defeated Lux by eight to three in the first round. Although the main players Li Ning, Sun Jinshun, and Jia Youliang were attending the World Games preliminaries this time, it did not affect their strength. The match was lively and colorful, and Donghua emerged victorious with a score of four to zero.</p>

<p>First Record</p>
<p>Both teams made contact at the beginning of the game. Donghua's five forwards directly approached the enemy country. Seeing the situation was not good, General Mada rejected him thousands of miles away. Dai Lingjing led the troops, and returned to the fray, and knocked on the door at the twelve-yard mark on the left. Lao Bie was flustered and kicked in a mess, and the ball went straight into the corner of the net. The record was first opened, and the time was only two minutes. Cao Qiuting started an uprising on the border, penetrated alone, and kicked with all his strength. It was too high and turned into a baseball. Chen Dehui made a comeback, but the goalkeeper bounced back in helplessness, and he did not build meritorious service.</p>
<p>Capture the City Again</p>
<p>At this point, the enemy army launched a fierce counterattack and was full of arrogance. Bauseli made a high ball, and Simmons fired a cannon on top of it. Sun Saiqing jumped up and hugged him, and was not poisoned. Donghua attacked again, Shu Tugeng raised the flag on the border, intercepted Zhang Jinhai's ball, and shot with all his strength on the baseline, and unexpectedly Ma Li succeeded.</p>
<h3>Athletes Attending the World Games Gather in Beijing for Instructions, Dai Chuanxian will go to Germany in July</h3>

<p>Remote Shot Hits the Mark After lemon , Chen Dehui still took advantage of the Chen to attack and led his division to conquest. After three passes and five passes, he reached the enemy camp and hit the mark with a remote shot on the baseline. The score was three to zero. Lux tried to cheer up, but he couldn't do what he wanted, so he called out in a row. Chen Dehui was lightly fired and attacked twice, but he was too high. At this time, the ball was often circling in front of the enemy's door.</p>
<p>Won Four Goals After a long period of melee, Dai Linjing straightened his arms and joined forces with Chen Dehui. Chen lifted his leg to shoot, but Lao Bie was destroyed. Xi Linjing caught up and shot again, and he was also selected to refuse. The enemy, Yun Baochulun, still got the ball and ran wildly, rushing into our army's formation. Da Sun Baoqing's high and low were all turned into danger in the midst of decline. Cao Qiuting went on an expedition on the border and immediately passed it to the center. Chen Dehui ambushed Chen Qian, greeted him in advance, and went straight to the heart. The enemy army was in trouble, Lai En entered the invaders on the right, and missed the opportunity to shoot with inaccuracy. Donghua still won a complete victory against Ke Si with four to zero.</p>
<p>Western Capture Forfeits The Western Union Football A Group game, Donghua vs Western Capture, was originally scheduled to be the second round of the game at Shen on the afternoon of today at 3:30.

<h3>Youyou Lost to French Merchants Youyoufu missed two penalty kicks with a score of three to four Today, the two teams will play again at Shen Garden</h3>
<p>The French Merchants vs Youyou football league, which is related to the outcome of this year's Western Union A Group Championship, made a hard effort to make up a division because the players were not enough to command. Wang Caigao and Sun Huipei, both Yongyuan, played in two consecutive games, a fierce fire competition for one hundred and ninety minutes. In the first half, they still had the most superior situation with a score of three to two. I never thought that in the second half, under extreme fatigue, the French Merchants were given an opportunity to take advantage of, and the French Merchants scored two consecutive goals, winning a victory of four to three. The strength of yesterday's French Merchants was also greatly reduced. Kelaito was also unable to attend due to the suspension of the game. Robertson Stov was still barbaric. There was nothing to recommend throughout the game. The god of luck was on the French army. Youyou Xu Wenkui missed two penalty kicks, and also hit two goals, because of the offside, Youyou was tragically defeated under the demise of the heavens. The two teams will meet again in Yiyuan today. Youyou B Group also lost to Saint Francis by four to two yesterday.</p>

<h3>Balance of International Payments</h3>
<p>In previous years' reports, this Bank has mentioned the difficulty of collecting public figures for estimating the balance of our country's international payments. In the past year, it has been even more difficult to seek an accurate estimate. The reason is that the situation is eventful, especially in North China. Sometimes the customs authorities encounter difficulties they cannot overcome when exercising their powers. As a result, huge quantities of rayon, cigarette paper, matches, and other goods were imported without tax. The same is true for preventing the outflow of silver coins. The silver content of silver coins far exceeds their foreign exchange value, and those who smuggle them by chance make huge profits.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The following table estimates the privately imported goods and privately exported silver, which are obtained by consulting various parties and based on the statistics published by neighboring countries, but can only be regarded as approximate.</p>
<p>China's Balance of International Payments in the 24th Year of the Republic of China (Unit: Millions of National Currency)</p>
<p>The estimated remittance of Huajie is based on surveys of various places that often have such remittances in the country. Considering the lengthening of foreign exchange and the instability of the currency situation last year, it is far beyond expectations, but it can be said that the commercial industry in the country where the overseas Chinese reside has improved.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the currency situation was unstable, and there is no doubt that most of the funds escaped. Even though some of them returned to their homeland after the implementation of the new currency system in early November, the number of outflows throughout the year is still huge.</p>
<p>In addition, as a natural result of adopting the new currency system and subsequently selling a portion of the foreign silver overseas, the foreign currency owned by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank greatly increased. However, the total amount of this transfer of funds cannot be determined, so it has to be included under the "Unproven Source" item for balance.</p>
<p>In this year, the estimation of our country's balance of international payments is greatly affected by the unproven movement of silver, the private import of goods, and various unknown trades, so mistakes are unavoidable. However, in order to understand our country's financial and economic problems, the figures listed in the table above may have some reference value.</p>
<h3>Overview of Agriculture</h3>
<p>Although there were occasional droughts and floods in the country last year, the nation's farmers generally had a good year. The total harvest of agricultural products, while not exceptionally abundant, fetched slightly higher prices than in the previous two years. Consequently, farmers' total income was about one-tenth higher than in the preceding two years. Foreign trade in agricultural products was also quite favorable. While agricultural exports did decline, the reduction was not as significant as the decrease in agricultural imports. In fact, the total value of exports exceeded that of imports, a phenomenon unseen since the European War.</p>
<p>The cost of agricultural production is difficult to estimate due to the lack of statistical data. However, judging from the prices of wages, fertilizers, seeds, and farming tools, there were no major fluctuations over the past year. Meanwhile, low interest rates from bank loans and cooperative societies, coupled with improved rural transportation and security, have contributed to a downward trend in agricultural production costs. Although a complete rural revival has not yet been witnessed, there are signs of improvement. New farmhouses and village schools are seen everywhere. There is also a reverse trend of population migration from cities to rural areas. Many farmers' children are seeking education in nearby suburbs. All these factors indicate the favorable economic conditions of farmers. Had it not been for the Yangtze River flooding and the severe drought in North China last year, agricultural recovery would have made significant progress. The special characteristics of agriculture in the past year are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>One: Agricultural Harvests</p>
<p>China's main agricultural products are grain and cotton. According to estimates by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, a comparison of harvest quantities for the last three years is shown in the following table (in millions of piculs):</p>
<p>Last year's total grain harvest was 6% higher than in the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] and 2% lower than in the 22nd year [1933]. Rice and wheat are the major components of grain. The total wheat production last year was 42.2 million piculs, while it was 45 million piculs in the 23rd year and 45.1 million piculs in the 22nd year. Thus, last year's production decreased by 6% compared to the previous two years. The total rice production was 85.1 million piculs, while it was 70.36 million piculs in the 23rd year and 86.9 million piculs in the 22nd year. Although last year's production was less than in the 22nd year, it increased by 16% compared to the 23rd year. As a result of the bumper harvest, rice prices were not high last autumn and winter, and imported foreign rice was also less. The total cotton production last year decreased by 10% compared to the 23rd year and 15% compared to the 22nd year. North China experienced a poor harvest due to the early spring, decreasing by 25% compared to the 23rd year and 15% compared to the 22nd year. The central region decreased by 16% compared to the 22nd year but increased by 10% compared to the 23rd year.</p>
<p>Two: Agricultural Product Prices</p>
<p>The following are the wholesale prices in Shanghai for several major agricultural products:</p>
<p>One: Rice – As mentioned above, rice production last year was 16% higher than the previous year. Before the new rice hit the market in the first half of the year, Suzhou rice averaged 13 yuan per picul, and Hunan rice averaged 9 yuan per picul. After the new rice hit the market in the second half of the year, Suzhou rice fell to an average of 11.5 yuan per picul, and Hunan rice fell to 8.1 yuan per picul, slightly lower than in the 23rd year but 35% higher than in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>Two: Wheat – The average wheat price in the first half of last year was 3.7 yuan per picul. Due to the poor harvest, it rose to 4.2 yuan per picul in the second half of the year, 14% more expensive than in the 23rd year and 30% more expensive than in the 22nd year.</p>
<p>Three: Cotton – The average cotton price in the first half of last year was 34 yuan for standard grade and 41 yuan for Lingbao grade. In the second half of the year, standard grade rose to 36 yuan, and Lingbao grade rose to 42 yuan. Compared to the previous two years, this change was due to the poor harvest, but there was no significant difference compared to the price of the previous year.</p>
<p>Four: Silk – Silk prices rose sharply last year. High-quality factory silk averaged 460 yuan per picul in the first half of the year, fell to 400 yuan, then returned to 460 yuan. In the last three months, it averaged 720 yuan per picul. The rise in silk prices was attributed to decreased production and, more importantly, increased overseas demand.</p>
<p>Three: Foreign Trade in Agricultural Products</p>
<p>According to customs reports, the total value of major agricultural imports last year, including rice, wheat, cotton, and tobacco leaves, was almost 188 million yuan. In the 23rd year [1934], it was 228 million yuan, and in the 22nd year [1933], it was 294 million yuan. Rice imports were valued at 41 million yuan, an increase of 41% compared to the previous year. Wheat imports were valued at 36 million yuan, an increase of 14% compared to the previous year. Due to the bumper cotton harvest in the previous year, the total value of cotton imports last year was only 41 million yuan, while it was 90 million yuan in the previous year. The total value of tobacco leaf imports last year decreased from 31 million yuan in the previous year to 8.5 million yuan, due to increased domestic production and reduced public purchasing power.</p>
<p>The total export value of twelve agricultural products, including silk, tea, tung oil, and peanuts, was 231 million yuan last year. In the 23rd year [1934], it was 192 million yuan, and in the 22nd year [1933], it was 247 million yuan. Last year's exports were better than the previous year due to increased overseas demand for tung oil, peanuts, peanut oil, and raw silk. The total value of tung oil exports last year was 42 million yuan, an increase of 58% compared to the previous year and 37% compared to the 22nd year. The total value of peanut and peanut oil exports was 30 million yuan, an increase of 83% compared to the previous year and 31% compared to the 22nd year. The total value of cotton exports was 28 million yuan, a decrease of 18% compared to the 22nd year but an increase of 39% compared to the previous year. The total value of egg and egg product exports was 32 million yuan, an increase of 6% compared to the previous year but a decrease of 12% compared to the 22nd year.</p>
<p>Four: Impact of Currency Reform</p>
<p>Last autumn, credit tightened in rural areas, and agricultural merchants lacked financial assistance, preventing farmers from selling their agricultural products to repay debts. The market stagnated, and the prices of agricultural products fell. After the implementation of the new currency system, rural markets experienced slight turmoil but quickly returned to normal within a few days, and transactions increased significantly. Wealthy farmers who were accustomed to hoarding silver began to purchase wheat and cotton, resulting in a 10-20% increase in agricultural prices within a few weeks. The sudden rise in agricultural prices provided considerable benefits to small farmers who sold their produce at that time.</p>
<p>Five: Rural Development</p>
<p>The most prominent aspects of rural development are highlighted below:</p>
<p>(A) Stem Borer Control: Stem borers are a major threat to rice cultivation in our country, causing significant damage in rice-growing areas. According to estimates by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the losses caused by stem borers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces alone exceed 100 million yuan annually. Although scientists have discovered effective methods for controlling stem borers, the lack of well-organized implementation has prevented these methods from being effective. Last August, the local government and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station jointly launched a stem borer control campaign in Jiangning County, resulting in the rice crop being spared from stem borer damage that year. Seventy million egg masses were removed in twelve days, preventing stem borer damage to 400,000 mu of rice paddies. This work required very little expenditure but saved farmers a huge amount of money by increasing their production.</p>
<p>(B) Transportation: Although many highways have been built in rural areas in recent years, highway transportation costs are too high, so the transportation and sale of agricultural products rely primarily on railways. Therefore, newly built railways have facilitated the transportation and sale of agricultural products, and their transportation costs have been reduced by 10-20%.</p>
<p>(C) Agricultural Improvement: Work on increasing the quantity and improving the quality of agricultural products has already been mentioned. Over the years, the government has established cotton improvement institutes, silk improvement institutes, tea improvement stations, and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station to conduct technical research. All aspects have made significant progress. For example, the National Economic Council's Cotton Improvement Institute has expanded its work from central markets to rural areas. Before the improvement of cotton production, ordinary improved cotton varieties in the market contained 15% moisture and 10% other impurities. Now, the moisture content has been reduced to 1.6% and other impurities to 1.4%.</p>
<p>Rice and wheat are the most important agricultural products in our country. Agricultural schools and provincial agricultural experiment stations have done some improvement work in the past, but they often lacked funding and technical personnel. Last year, the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Industry jointly established the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, which has ample funding and has gathered talent from across the country to begin work on a large scale.</p>
<p>(D) Rural Cooperation: In the past few years, the rural cooperative movement has been quite active in our country, but various groups have organized according to their own views and methods. Domestic and foreign cooperative experts have often worried that if this continues, the cooperative movement will be difficult to succeed. Recently, the Ministry of Industry has added a Cooperative Affairs Department, the National Economic Council has established a Cooperative Affairs Committee, and the Central Political School has added a Cooperative College, hoping that these new institutions can correct past mistakes and ensure that their legislation, promotion, and training of cooperative instructors are practical and effective, in order to seek future progress. The rural cooperative movement will soon become the central driving force for the economic and social revitalization of rural life.</p>
<p>(E) Rural Finance: Banks, with their extensive agricultural production, have only contributed a small amount to credit adjustment to this day. However, in recent years, society has gradually recognized the benefits of their contributions. As a result of banks extending loans through cooperatives, the number of draft cattle has increased, improved seeds and sufficient fertilizer have been used in large areas, and wells have been dug for irrigation and dikes have been built for flood control. Previously, rural interest rates were often between 3% and 10% per annum, but now they have fallen to 2-3%. Although rural lending is still in the experimental stage, it has proven that if farmers are provided with appropriate amounts of low-interest loans at the right time, it will definitely increase their efficiency in utilizing land and labor.</p>
<p>(F) Land System: Last year, agricultural scholars in our country paid great attention to the issue of tenant farming, believing that the land ownership system is the foundation of the rural economy. Unless the land issue is fully resolved, various efforts to improve agriculture will be superficial and of limited value. However, except for the Shanxi authorities' plan to implement village public ownership of land, it is still only a matter of discussion among scholars, but it has aroused national attention.</p>
<h3>Industrial Conditions</h3>
<p>Last year, China's industry experienced the hardships of tight credit. Most factories lacked sufficient capital and relied on bank loans for working capital. Last year's interest rates were too high, and even the most well-established factories had to limit their regular production. The money shops, which have the most dealings with general commerce, also reduced lending, and merchants had no way to accumulate inventory. In addition, competition from foreign goods, prolonged foreign exchange rates, and increased smuggling all dealt blows to domestic goods. The implementation of the new currency system in November was intended to ease credit, reduce foreign exchange rates, and thus raise prices to save the decline of domestic industry and promote its development.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the increase in import tariffs in recent years has been sufficient to encourage the increasing quantity and variety of domestic goods, especially in light industry. Moreover, with the support of the government, they are moving further into the creation of basic industries. However, large-scale domestic industries are still in their infancy. The earliest established and best-developed joint-stock company enterprises in the country are banks, and it is undoubtedly their responsibility to guide factory enterprises to improve their organization and further promote their development. Unfortunately, to this day, they have only provided short-term loans at most. Now, let us try to describe the conditions of various industries last year:</p>
<p>Textile Industry: The weakness of China's textile industry is due to excessive dividends and insufficient depreciation during its heyday, which made it unable to sustain itself under last year's tight credit and bleak market conditions. As a result, most factories were forced to completely or partially suspend operations. By the end of June, spindles that had been shut down accounted for 40% of the total. Although many factories勉强resumed operations after the new cotton hit the market, the number of spindles and looms that were not in operation at the end of the year still reached 25%. However, foreign-owned textile factories, due to sound financial management and low-interest rates, were in very good condition.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn prices were extremely low throughout last year. The price of standard yarn in June was 158.9 yuan per package, the lowest record in 15 years. After the currency reform, cotton imports decreased slightly, and yarn prices rose sharply, jumping from 177.66 yuan per package in October to 195.47 yuan per package in November. However, while yarn prices rose, cotton prices also increased. The prices of American and Indian cotton increased due to the decline in foreign exchange rates, and domestic cotton prices also rose in tandem.</p>
<p>From July of the 23rd year [1934] to June of the 24th year [1935], the national cotton yarn production totaled 3,298,504 dan of coarse yarn, 725,611 dan of fine yarn, and 71,529 dan of mixed yarn, for a total of 4,095,646 dan. Of the yarn produced by Chinese factories, coarse yarn accounted for 77%, fine yarn accounted for 33%, and mixed yarn accounted for 41%. Of the yarn produced by Japanese factories, coarse yarn accounted for 21%, fine yarn accounted for 66%, and mixed yarn accounted for 56%. The remainder was produced by British factories.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, it is worth mentioning that most Chinese factories had to reduce expenses in this recession, so production costs have been reduced. At the same time, most old machines have been improved, and a considerable number of automatic looms have been added.</p>
<p>Silk Reeling Industry: Silk prices were very low at the beginning of the year, but by June, overseas demand increased, and prices rose, reaching a new record in recent years in November. Last year, silk prices jumped from a low of 380 yuan per dan to over 700 yuan.</p>
<p>As a result of carefully selecting disease-free silkworm eggs last year, the quality and uniformity of the silk produced have improved. Regardless of the assistance from overseas occasional influences last year, this can indeed be expected to be a permanent benefit to the silk industry.</p>
<p>The total output of silkworm cocoons in the 24th year [1935] was 1.4 million dan, and the total output of raw silk was 95,000 dan, of which 60,000 dan were produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, 10,000 dan in Sichuan, Hubei, and Shandong, and 15,000 dan in Guangdong. The production of Jiangsu and Zhejiang accounted for 63% of the total production, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. Approximately 300 silk reeling factories operated nationwide last year, with a total of 123,000 reeling machines, but the number varied with market conditions and silk prices. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces alone, 20 factories were in operation at the beginning of the year, but the number gradually increased after June, reaching 90 factories in October, with 24,000 reeling machines.</p>
<p>Flour Milling Industry: The production and sales of flour were relatively smooth last year, and the flour milling industry generally made a profit. Domestic wheat was still in short supply and relied on imported foreign wheat, especially Australian wheat.</p>
<p>Last year, a total of 94 flour mills were in operation, including 14 in Shanghai, 4 in Wuxi, 7 in Jinan, 6 in Qingdao, 5 in Tianjin, 3 in Kaifeng, and 58 in other regions. The total annual flour production was 79,468,518 bags (each bag weighing 49 pounds), an increase of 7,821,468 bags over the 22nd year [1933] and an increase of 8,909,356 bags over the 23rd year [1934]. The total annual sales of domestic flour were 78,999,418 bags. The total import of foreign flour for the year was 510,496 metric tons, approximately 2,000,000 bags, a decrease of 376,000 bags compared to the 23rd year [1934].</p>
<p>Cement Industry: The cement industry enjoyed high prices in the 23rd year [1934], but last year, due to financial constraints, construction projects decreased, and cement sales also declined. In addition, foreign goods were sold aggressively, so almost all domestic factories suffered significant losses.</p>
<p>Due to excessive freight costs, inland areas such as Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Sichuan have established their own factories. The Guangdong provincial government-owned Shimin Cement Factory has also added new machines. Therefore, regardless of the decrease in demand and low prices, the total annual cement production still reached 3.77 million barrels, an increase of 360,000 barrels compared to the 23rd year [1934].</p>
<p>Match Industry: Last year, the match industry continued its decline from the previous year. Smuggled matches from areas such as Fulu in North China flooded the market, and domestic factories that paid taxes suffered losses due to competition with smuggled goods. To prevent overproduction, factories in the seven provinces of central China established a joint sales organization for the match industry, which has been quite effective since its implementation. However, the situation was extremely poor for factories in Hebei and Shandong provinces, which were outside this joint sales area. Chinese and Japanese and Swiss match factories in various parts of the country have proposed jointly adopting a quota production system. If this can be implemented, not only can domestic overproduction be avoided, but smuggling can also be somewhat curbed.</p>
<p>Last year, a total of 69 match factories operated nationwide. The total production of safety matches was 267,932 cases, the total production of phosphorus sulfide matches was 524,486 cases, and the total production of loose matches was 8,382 cases. The total sales of matches for the year were 748,018 cases, similar to the 23rd year [1934], but a decrease of 98,763 cases compared to the 22nd year [1933].</p>
<p>Sugar Manufacturing Industry: The high import tax on sugar in our country is sufficient to encourage the development of the sugar manufacturing industry. The Guangdong provincial government has established six sugar refineries, of which three have already shipped goods. The Guangxi provincial government is also starting to build one factory. Sichuan, which used to produce refined sugar for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, is also a promising area for sugar production and is planning to build a large-scale sugar refinery in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Although the production of sugarcane and sugar beets in our country is still insufficient, the profit from sugar manufacturing is very high. Although the current annual sugar production is only 150,000 dan, it is believed that with the protection of tariffs, if the current rampant smuggling can be prevented, it may be possible to produce a large amount of sugar for self-sufficiency in a few years.</p>
<p>Chemical Industry: The rapid development of light industry in our country in recent years has led industrialists to tend towards the manufacture of chemical raw materials. The most prominent examples are the 7 million yuan capital nitric acid plant under construction in Pukou, the 2.5 million yuan capital alcohol plant that has started production in Pudong, Shanghai, the organic dye plant in Tianjin that manufactures various dyes, and the newly established chemical factory in Shanxi that manufactures acids, alcohol, and ether.</p>
<h3>Economic Construction</h3>
<p>In recent years, the country has faced frequent disasters. For example, there were the floods of 1931 and 1935, the loss of the Northeast in 1931, and the Communist rebellion raging in the central provinces for a long time, leading to the bankruptcy of rural areas and a decline in purchasing power. Furthermore, the disturbance of the situation in North China last year, and the extraordinary increase in silver prices, which decoupled from the traditionally connected relationship with commodity prices, resulted in our country's monetary and financial system falling into a state of crisis. These examples are numerous. However, despite these difficult times, in terms of economic construction and development, there has been some material progress worthy of mention. Our people, aware of the weakness of the nation's position, have come to feel the necessity of self-reliance, and there is an urgent need for plans to consolidate the economic foundation. In recent years, considerable achievements have been made in these plans.</p>
<p>Local governments in various provinces have voluntarily engaged in the development of transportation and the establishment of industries, with considerable success. In addition, the National Economic Council, with funds from national treasury agreements and the consultation and support of technical experts sent by the League of Nations, was able to expand its work to the whole country. However, due to limited resources, the Council had to focus on several key tasks and restrict itself to selected areas, concentrating on highways, water conservancy, public health, and agricultural revival. Here is a brief summary of its achievements last year:</p>
<p>Highways and Transportation: By the end of October last year, the highways built with the assistance of the Council exceeded 20,000 kilometers, with half of them having paved surfaces suitable for automobile traffic. The following is an overview of the centrally assisted highway construction at the end of last year (unit: kilometer):</p>
<p>The Council also assisted in establishing provincial highway transportation committees to provide consultation and advice on traffic regulations, public bus operations, and traffic convenience, such as the provision of gasoline and first aid stations, as well as telephone road signs and patrol police. The most important work was to unify vehicle taxes and eliminate excessive taxes.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy: Few nations in the world rely on water management as much as our country for the welfare of its people. In the plains of our country, the peace and security of the people depend on the condition of rivers and levees. If a breach occurs, disasters follow. However, it is not only floods that are a concern. In some areas, the only way to ensure safety from drought is to painstakingly manage wells and canals for irrigation. The initial water management work of the National Economic Council was to take over the projects of the National Flood Relief Commission's work relief program. Its initial scope was limited, but it was transformed into the highest administrative body for national water management last year. The Council's first great irrigation project was the Jingwei Canal in the Northwest, which was completed last spring, irrigating 45 million mu of land and making it an important cotton production center. As for the water conservancy projects in the Northwest Gansu, Ningxia, and the border area between Jiangsu and Anhui, some have been completed, while others are still under construction. The desolation of the Jin Kou dried-up lake in western Hubei, not far from Hankou, covering over 900,000 mu, was completed last April. During the widespread floods last summer, the Council also paid close attention to the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, engaging in emergency relief and levee repair work.</p>
<p>Public Health: In the area of public health, the Council, through its Health Department, established experimental investigation agencies, conducted public health experiments, trained various public health education and medical personnel, and assisted local authorities in disease prevention, sanitation, and scientific research, resulting in many beneficial works.</p>
<p>Agricultural Revival: Our country is based on agriculture. If overseas demand for our agricultural products increases, our foreign trade will benefit greatly, the purchasing power of farmers will increase, and the national economy will be revitalized. Therefore, the reconstruction and development of rural areas are essential for the current economic development. In the past few years, the National Economic Council has successively engaged in improving silkworm breeds, improving cotton production, and organizing cooperatives to improve the welfare of farmers.</p>
<p>Sericulture: The recent reduction in silk exports from our country is primarily due to the degradation of silk quality. The degradation of silk quality is partly due to the inferiority of silkworm breeds and partly due to the outdated methods of silk reeling. The Silk Improvement Committee has established experimental farms to study and propagate superior breeds in our country. To increase the breeding of superior breeds, farms were established in Nanjing and Hangzhou for incubation. At the same time, the latest sericulture methods are being disseminated in sericulture schools in Hushu Pass in Suzhou and Zhenjiang, as well as in sericulture centers in various locations. The achievements of the cooperation between the Silk Improvement Committee and the Zhejiang Provincial Government were significant. In the autumn of 1934, when silk prices fell to a very low point, no one cared about silkworms. The Zhejiang Provincial Government purchased all the autumn silkworm cocoons in the province and, in conjunction with the best silk reeling factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, provided special supervision over reeling. The quality of the reeled silk was excellent, and it was sold at a good price in the world market. Last year, the work was expanded, and over 4,000 bales of superior silk were sold, resulting in excellent profits.</p>
<p>Cotton Industry: The Cotton Industry Control Committee, established in October 1933, focused on improving cotton production and striving ultimately for textile production. As a result of the cooperation between the Central Cotton Improvement Institute and the governments of Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, and Hebei provinces, improved cotton varieties were sown on 1,376,000 mu of cotton fields, resulting in not only improved cotton quality but also increased yields. The primary task of the committee is investigation and research, so it has established many experimental farms to study various cotton planting issues, paying close attention to eliminating pests. To improve transportation and sales and eliminate middlemen between cotton farmers and manufacturers, 63 cooperatives were established, and a central cotton production and marketing office was set up in Shanghai to seek direct production and sales. Furthermore, the best cotton standards were established to reduce moisture and adulteration, and cooperation with various universities was enhanced to facilitate the training of cotton cultivation guidance and working personnel.</p>
<p>Railway Construction: Currently, the Ministry of Railways, provincial governments, and commercially operated railway companies have jointly planned to build 2,500 kilometers of new railways, with three-ninths completed last year. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway, guaranteed by the British Boxer Indemnity, borrowed 1.5 million pounds in Shanghai in June 1934, allowing for the continuation of the construction of 720 kilometers of new railway last year. Shanxi completed the 633-kilometer narrow-gauge railway running north-south through the province from Puzhou to Yuanping. The construction capital for this railway was provided by the Shanxi Provincial Government. When the entire railway is completed, it will connect with the Ping-Sui Railway. In 1932, the Bank of China, in conjunction with various banks, assisted the Zhejiang Provincial Government in constructing the railway from Hangzhou to Yushan on the border of Jiangxi. Last year, it was extended 291 kilometers to Nanchang, and work has now begun to extend it to Pingxiang. When completed, it will connect with the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in Zhuzhou, Hunan, allowing for transportation between Guangdong and Shanghai by rail. Last year, the Longhai Railway was extended 20 kilometers westward from Xi'an to Xianyang and 30 kilometers eastward from Dapei to Laoyao. In addition, several short-distance railways are under construction. These transportation constructions are sufficient to assist in the transportation and sale of inland agricultural products and facilitate their convenience.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned construction work, such as highways, water conservancy, rural areas, cooperatives, sericulture, cotton planting, and railways, has been directly or indirectly assisted by our bank and other banks.</p>

<h3>Finance: Buying Interest Gradually Declining, Gold Premium Falls Again</h3>
<p>The gold market declined yesterday due to a slight increase in foreign silver prices and weaker buying interest domestically, but the upward trend was still relatively stable with few transactions and a more cautious wait-and-see attitude. There was a lack of support. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw slight increases in London and stability in the US. The telegraph reported that after the market close, there were a few Indian purchases according to the posted prices. The price of forward silver in Montreux showed minimal fluctuations, and the exchange rate narrowed slightly. The price of raw gold in London rose by half a shilling. The Central Bank's posted prices remained the same for both the UK and the US, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard gold premium was posted at 1143.5 yuan. The off-market preparatory transaction opened at a relatively strong 46.5 yuan. Da Fa, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Shen, and Da Yong all sold, resulting in a slightly lower opening in the morning. After the opening, the market was relatively stable, but selling pressure gradually increased, leading to a slight decline. However, due to the Oufeng Bank, the posted prices remained the same for both the UK and the US, and the silver parity tax remained unchanged. In the middle of the day, there were some who took advantage of the lower prices to purchase in limited quantities, resulting in a slight increase. Later, due to some congestion at the bank, there was a lack of support. The selling was eager, but transactions were limited, and the trend continued to weaken by noon. The market conditions for half a day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1146.4 yuan, slightly lower by one jiao compared to the previous close. Qing Fa, Yong Da, Xie Cheng, and Heng Yu all entered, rising to 6.5 yuan. Shen Da, Yong Da, De Cheng, Da Fa, and Yong took profits at high prices, falling back to 6.3 yuan. Qia Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, and Yong bought in limited quantities. The HSBC's posted prices remained the same for both the UK and the US, and the situation stabilized. Later, due to Qian Chang Xiang and Da De Cheng selling, the price fell to 1146.6 yuan. The silver parity tax was unchanged. Ding Kang and Yi Yu paid taxes, rising to 1146.3 yuan. Da Fa, Yong Qia Feng, Yong Fu Tai, Yong Chun Yuan all sold strips together. Mitsui sold US dollars for May at 875, falling to 1146.05 yuan. However, the posted price was only 1146.06 yuan, unclear by one jiao. Shen Da Yong covered short positions, rebounding to 1146.2 yuan. Fu Yu, Fu Tai, Yong Da, De Cheng, Da Feng, and Heng Lai sold, causing the afternoon close to fall to 1146 yuan. After the market closed, the market was weaker, around 1145.8-9 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to the Central Bank's posted price of the standard gold premium, rose to 1143.5 yuan.

<h3>Commercial Slump, Financial Stagnation As Usual</h3>
<p>In recent days, the foreign exchange market has remained stable at 9% and 8% throughout the day, with little fluctuation. The reason is nothing more than the unevenness of supply and demand due to the market's decline. In the current situation, there is probably no hope of improvement. Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate was still at 9%, which is the reason for this. As for bill transactions, although they are far less prosperous than at the same time last year, there are no bills to speak of among colleagues except for a few substantial ones.

<p>The opening of the Sakura cotton market was unstable because the US cotton market rose and fell yesterday. It lacked certainty. It was expected that the general trend would be hovering.

The local market also remained in a wait-and-see mode. The total number of packages opened in the entire city was 2,500 packages of late Jiangxi machine rice, 350 packages of Anqing machine rice, 45 packages of Taizhou early rice, with other imports and exports being minimal.

<h3>Silk and Tea: Summary of Qimen New Black Tea News</h3>

<h3>The Golden Age of Working Women</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>What is the most appropriate age for women to serve society? This question has already been studied in several countries. The editor of the American magazine "Modern" conducted a survey of eleven large stores in the city. According to the results of the survey, there were a total of 783 female sales clerks in these eleven stores. The distribution of age and number of people is as follows:</p>
<p>In these eight groups, the average sales performance was the best in the 26-30 age group, but the best individual performance was by a female sales clerk aged 32. The statistics were based on the goods sold and money received in August and December of 1935. The editor also received a lot of help from senior officials of the eleven companies when conducting the survey. Therefore, these statistics are quite reliable.</p>
<p>However, the statistics of the editor of the Chicago magazine "Little Bug" differ somewhat. The survey was of 269 female old goods clerks in seven large companies. The distribution of age and number of people is as follows:</p>
<p>In these four groups, although the individual sales performance was highest for two people aged 31 and 43, the average calculation still showed that the 26-35 age group was the best. Therefore, the manager of the Chicago Morse Department Store said, "Older female sales clerks are indeed unable to attract customers, but those who are too young are often unable to satisfy people. Only middle-aged female sales clerks not only have a reasonable and non-annoying appearance to customers, but also have considerable family burdens, so they are much more diligent in their duties than younger ones. When customers shop, they often inquire with middle-aged female sales clerks, wanting to learn some life lessons from their life experience. This is because older female sales clerks are always so stubborn, and younger female sales clerks are always so frivolous and impractical, which is why middle-aged female sales clerks are the most popular. - Female sales clerks are not Hollywood movie stars, nor are they Broadway song and dance stars. What female sales clerks need is an age that is neither too old nor too young. Not too old is to avoid annoying customers. Not too young is because they have considerable commercial experience."</p>
<p>Russia has also recently paid attention to the relationship between women's age and work. According to statistics from 1934, the women with the highest production capacity in the weaving and dyeing industry were those aged 26-28. However, the best individual performance was by a woman aged 32. The average age for women in the agricultural tool manufacturing industry was 27-30. The best individual performance was by two people aged 30 and 31. The average age for women in the leather industry was 28-30. The best individual performance was also by a person aged 30. According to statistics from 1935, the average productivity of women in the weaving and dyeing industry was highest between the ages of 26 and 30. In the agricultural tool manufacturing industry, it was 29-32. In the leather industry, it was 28-31. Although this survey is not enough to represent all working women in Russia, it can be seen from this statistic that the highest age for women's productivity in Russia is around 30 years old. Or, to say that it is from 25-26 to 33 years old, that is unlikely to be wrong.</p>
<p>Judging from the statistics of the United States and Russia, the golden age of working women starts at the earliest at 25 years old. This is enough to make the working women of our country reflect deeply.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of Chinese Women</h3>
<p>— (Yang Zhigang)</p>
<p>These are some noteworthy actions of international women at the moment: Germany is training six million women to serve the country in wartime; Italian women across the country are sending their wedding rings to the government to resist the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy; Albanian women are automatically sending their husbands to war; and US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt is donating all of the more than $70,000 she earned from ten radio speeches to charity organizations.</p>
<p>That's what international women are doing, but what about Chinese women? According to the International Trade Bureau, "In the past nine months, the import of consumer goods for women in our country, such as perfumes and cosmetics, has exceeded one million."</p>
<p>This is the astonishing consumption of Chinese women, and it is also the greatness of Chinese women.</p>
<h3>Women and Children</h3>
<p>— Nai Chang</p>
<p>——Written for Children's Day——</p>
<p>In America, the "heaven of women," some husbands take their children to the park on holidays and let them play by themselves, while the fathers sit on benches and stare at the sky. Since the responsibility of looking after the children has been given to the husbands, the mothers can freely go to meet friends or go somewhere to have fun.</p>
<p>In another country where men and women are relatively equal - Soviet women work in various industrial and cultural sectors like everyone else and do not have time to take care of their children, so they have organizations such as nurseries to take care of and educate the children on behalf of the mothers.</p>
<p>However, in China, which is a semi-colonial country, women cannot leave their children to their husbands like women in the capitalist golden country, nor can they leave their children to nurseries like in socialist Soviet Union. The women in general middle and lower class families can only take care of their children themselves. However, many of these mothers do not have the ability, that is, they do not have the common sense to educate their children. A child's temperament and hobbies are originally easy to understand, but in the eyes of these women, the children's temperament and hobbies become incomprehensible. They arbitrarily beat their children when they think they are hateful, and overindulge them when they think they are cute. Therefore, the fate of many children is ruined in the hands of these ignorant mothers.</p>
<p>Because family education and school education cannot be properly coordinated, many children live in contradictory environments. Let's think about it: for example, children learn politeness, kindness, and cleanliness at school, but when they return home, their mothers' aimless education methods give them bad influences such as competition, selfishness, hatred, and filth. Because the influence of family education in China is more profound than that of school education, many children in such contradictory environments become worse.</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country, and we use April 4th as Children's Day every year, hoping to expand this meaning. But in our China, the responsibility that women should bear for children is a thousand times greater than that of men, so I hope that from this year's Children's Day, women should combine family education with school education!</p>

<h3>Ms. Yang Meizhen Talks About the Current Situation of Women's Lives in the United States</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Work for labor, enjoy for enjoyment;</p>
<p>Eat, wear, live comfortably, with money everything is enough!</p>
<p>Time: 3:00 PM on April 1, 25th year</p>
<p>Location: Reception room of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association</p>
<p>People: Reporter of this newspaper, Ms. Yang Meizhen, Master's degree, Liu Wang Liming</p>
<p>(Introduction) The reception room, facing west, has several Western paintings hanging on the walls, and four pots of fresh flowers on the table. Ms. Yang Meizhen is talking to Mrs. Liu. Ms. Yang is a dignified woman, wearing a black呢皮 overcoat. They are talking very attentively.</p>
<p>There is a soft knock on the door. The page boy comes to open the door and invites the reporter in. Both of them stand up and bow to the reporter. After Mrs. Liu introduces them, they each take their seats, and the conversation begins.</p>
<p>Reporter - Madam, you have just returned from the United States. I think you have a very thorough observation of the women's issue there. Please feel free to express some of your thoughts.</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - I am very ashamed! Besides studying in the United States, I never had time to investigate. I am afraid I cannot provide good materials.</p>
<h3>Ms. Yang Meizhen</h3>
<p>Reporter - Did you go to Europe when you went abroad, Madam?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - I went to sea in May of the year before last and first went to Sweden to represent China at the 17th World Women's Temperance Association and the Paris International Women's Congress. Then I lived in England, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, and the Soviet Union to investigate the women's movement. In October, I crossed the ocean to the United States and entered the University of Pennsylvania to study sociology. I graduated last year and am now returning to China.</p>
<p>Reporter - Please talk about the current situation of women in the United States.</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - The ability of American women to move is admirable. After they leave school, they serve society for a few years before getting married. After marriage, they take charge of household affairs, but some come out to work again because their husbands are unemployed or their finances are not sufficient to supplement their household expenses. Generally speaking, the trends of American women are: some are active in politics, some are looking for jobs, some enjoy a noble life, some are tending to the labor world, and most are still becoming good wives and mothers after marriage. The most common female occupations are teachers and store clerks. Women account for 80% of primary and secondary school teachers and more than 90% of store clerks.</p>
<p>Reporter - Can American housewives generally be responsible for managing household affairs?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - As far as I know, they can all work. Except for a few rich and noble women who enjoy themselves, most are completely responsible for household affairs. They do their own cooking, sewing, washing, childcare, and even wiping windows and washing floors, because their middle and lower-class families do not hire servants, which is slightly different from the situation in our country.</p>
<p>Reporter - According to this, American women have a lot of inequality between suffering and happiness. Please give a general comment, Madam.</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - In general: American women are more educated than those in other countries and have a strong sense of unity; they can strive independently to find a life, and the women's movement has reached a successful path. However, they also have many shortcomings, such as: being noisy, vain, having no budget for household expenses, having a shallow understanding of life, often taking enjoyment as the center, and divorcing at every turn if there is a slight disagreement between husband and wife; these seem to be inferior to Chinese women who are rich in moral concepts, maybe it's just my biased view.</p>
<p>Reporter - This is related to urban women, so what is the life of rural women like?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - Rural women are rich in the spirit of labor. This point is very similar between the United States and our country, but they have all received considerable education, and they also have gatherings on Sundays to connect their feelings and engage in proper entertainment, which is not possible in our country's countryside for a while.</p>
<p>Reporter - How are the Chinese students in the United States?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - Most of the students in the United States are good. Since the national crisis, everyone feels that it is not enough to serve the country without solid learning, and there are more people studying science in recent years than before, but some go to study abroad after graduating from high school. They have weak wills and no experience, and it is easy to go astray. I advocate that it should be strictly stipulated that after graduating from university, they should serve for a few years, have a deep understanding of the motherland, and have considerable achievements in what they have learned, and then go abroad to study, which is meaningful.</p>
<p>Reporter - Have you heard or seen anything about the state of US preparations for war?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - I have seen a little bit. The American people are also very afraid of war and oppose war. The peace movement is popular for a while, but the government is still actively preparing.</p>
<p>Reporter - What will you devote yourself to society after returning to China?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - Do more small things, don't talk big.</p>
<p>Reporter - What instructions do you have for the women's world?</p>
<p>Ms. Yang - I very much hope that knowledgeable women will do more practical work, seek happiness for poor women, and saving people is saving yourself. Doing one more thing provides one more opportunity to save the country and save the people.</p>
<p>A·B·C· came in, and the reporter said goodbye and left.</p>
<h3>The Revolution in Japanese Women's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The most striking thing about Japanese women every day is a high and large bun, long-sleeved clothes, and high-heeled wooden clogs. These three points are the characteristics of Japanese women that no other country has. Japanese women's high buns usually have to be combed by someone else, which costs one, two or three yuan each time. Ordinary people have to dress up for social events or festivals, and their hair is covered with colorful flowers. When sleeping at night, they have to use a high and small wooden pillow to pad under their necks, and it gets messy again in four or five days. Therefore, most Japanese women hate their customs and change to ordinary buns. Hair is completely cut in girls' schools, and hair is only grown after graduation to prepare for marriage. There are many women in Tokyo who are more modern and cut their hair? Wu makes an ordinary bun, adding a few wavy perms.</p>
<p>Although Japanese women's buns have gradually been liberated, the clothes and waistbands are still circulating. A Japanese person said that if the sleeves of all Japanese people's clothes were reduced, the money saved would be enough to supply the Great War for three years. The large sleeves of my clothes can hold small items, which is equivalent to two pockets. However, the cuffs are too large and can easily fall off. And there are no pockets on kimonos, so they cannot store items. Their clothes all rely on a very wide belt to hold them together. Therefore, when a strong wind blows or they walk too fast, the bright red lining skirt inside will be exposed. Therefore, Japanese women are in a hurry and move in awkward hops.</p>
<p>This belt is not only used to tie clothes, but also the only decoration, and its value is often several times more expensive than the clothes. Wearing this wide belt around the waist in summer is really uncomfortable. Even Japanese women who are used to it cannot help but hate it. Therefore, young women are wearing Western clothes one after another, and now there are more than in Shanghai, China. The method of tying the belt is very complicated, consisting of three or four items. When Chinese female students first arrive in Japan, like Western women, they like to borrow Japanese clothes to try them on? But this knot is difficult to master even after learning for several days.</p>
<p>Recently, because women are wearing Western clothes one after another, the sales of Japanese clothing materials have been in a slump. On the one hand, because Japanese women's clothes are absolutely not like Chinese women's clothes, the styles change every moment. Their clothes have no changes except for the patterns and textures. A piece of clothing can be worn for at least four or five years without being affected. Therefore, someone recently invented a new method of dividing women's clothes into two sections, top and bottom, which can be changed at will, and using the waistband to connect the top and bottom clothes. This can make women reduce wearing Western clothes by trying them on. Soon, major companies will work hard to promote it, opening clothing revolution exhibitions as a slogan. However, it is still doubtful whether Japanese women's clothing can fit in with modernization. This kind of incomplete clothing revolution may not be able to reverse the economy. The Japanese textile industry is affected by modern women in China. In addition to promoting the clothing revolution to save it, the only way is to sell it to China, which will be easier to sell than in their country. What do readers think of Japan using a clothing revolution to resist Western clothing?</p>
<h3>The Heroines of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>The women's committees of Abyssinia can be called soldiers in the same way as men. At the beginning of the war, the women had already wiped their husbands' swords clean and sharpened them. But simply preparing for war is not enough to express their bravery and greatness. Soon, the first team of Abyssinian women's army was organized successfully. The founder was a woman known as "The One Who Turned into a Flower."</p>
<p>A year ago, she had a dream in which she rode a horse in front of a team of women's army to do the work of defending the country. She was inspired by the achievements of the French heroine Joan of Arc and began to organize a women's army. At first, she was not only ridiculed but also opposed. Later, the great proposal born of inspiration gradually gained the support of the women who had previously ridiculed her. They came in groups and waves to join her banner. Within a few weeks, the women's army she organized had three thousand heroic female warriors.</p>
<p>The real name of this leader is Voy Zero Abebech Charkoz, a wealthy young woman. She herself wears a European-style gray cloth military uniform with a lively red cape over it. The army she leads is strictly trained, and its discipline is strict. The weapons are all new Mauser automatic rifles, which she provides and controls herself. As soon as the first team of women's army was successfully organized, she led them in a mighty manner and set off for the Gondar front in a wave of cheers celebrating victory. After they arrived at their destination, tribal women volunteered to join. They could all use old-fashioned rifles and could fire them skillfully and accurately like their husbands. These tribal female warriors all wore images or badges of the Virgin Mary on their chests and rifles on their shoulders. They could also fight desperately and kill enemies like men and never shrink back.</p>
<p>The wife of Dedjasmatchapte Mikael, a general of the Abyssinian army, saw that the Italian army had occupied the mountain peak and gained a superior position, so she strongly urged her husband to attack. But this general was a careful and cautious man. He was afraid of being tricked into an ambush by enemy soldiers, so he dared not act rashly. He believed that the best strategy was to maintain the original position that was difficult for enemy soldiers to attack.</p>
<p>This brave and decisive lady had another opinion. She walked into the camp, put on her military uniform, gathered 150 daredevils, and went with her husband on mules to attack the Italian soldiers. Brave, enthusiastic, and death-defying soldiers immediately gathered in front of her. She also mounted a mule. They charged forward to attack the enemy soldiers in a burst of shouts.</p>
<p>The Italian soldiers saw that the attackers were a group of mule riders led by a woman, so they did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, although the attack was short, the offensive was very fierce. The cautious Abyssinian general heard the explosion of gunfire and quickly led reinforcements to respond. But when he rushed to the battlefield, he found that the reinforcements he led were not needed. Many Italian soldiers were killed and injured. This brave and good-at-war lady took the lead on a mule, led her team of daredevils who had performed great feats, and returned triumphantly with rifles and military supplies captured from the defeated enemy soldiers. (Excerpt from W.J. Makini's original work "Women March to War" published in Pearson's Meeky #2364 on November 16, 1935)</p>
<h3>After Marriage</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Guohua:</p>
<p>Zhijiu:</p>
<p>That day, in the snow-flurried evening, I leaned against the window, pondering married life when suddenly, footsteps drifted up the stairs into the room. Chun, carrying a stack of papers, walked in with a smile and said, "Hui! Guess who sent you this letter?" As he put down the papers, he pulled a light red letter from his pocket. I looked at the unfamiliar handwriting on the envelope and was momentarily puzzled. Opening it, I realized it was from a close friend I hadn't seen in years! How gratifying!</p>
<p>You said, "...You have gone through the ceremony that day, which can increase your interest in your career, and work together with one heart to serve society..." After reading it, besides being grateful for your encouragement, I also want to report on my life.</p>
<p>In society, we see many young ladies who, when in school, were ambitious and wanted to reform society and promote women's rights. However, once they leave school, they confine themselves to household chores or marry a husband, forgetting all their past lofty aspirations. Some even come into contact with a bad social environment and gradually degenerate, smoking, gambling, becoming completely different people. Naturally, this is something we don't want.</p>
<p>After I parted ways with you at Jinghai, I started teaching at a village elementary school in my hometown. At first, it was just a temporary measure, especially living alone in such a remote area. However, gradually, lively children, groups of them, jumping and running before my eyes, talking and laughing, revealing innocence and enthusiasm everywhere, sparks of life shining before me, made me slowly transform my perfunctory attitude from buttoning buttons, fastening trousers, and tying shoelaces, spending all my time for them, and being faithful to my duties out of interest. Although this may conflict with my past aspirations to take on the responsibility of the entire society, they are the future masters of China. I am actually able to lead them to prepare for entering society and becoming good people in the future, which is such an honor and worthy of pride!</p>
<p>Chun is still teaching at the central school three miles away from Baiyan. He wanted me to take on the kindergarten there, but how could I bear to leave these children I have been living with for the past three years? Although we are not together, we are both working hard for children's education, our goals are consistent, and our spirits are even more integrated.</p>
<p>The full moon is the day after tomorrow, and I will still return to Baiyan School, and Chun will also return to school to live! We must once again reinvigorate our work.</p>
<p>Finally, I must tell you that our love is indeed, as you said, "more united and pure after that ceremony."</p>
<p>Wishing you both all the best! Hui, at Lujia</p>
<h3>He Meigu's Wife</h3>
<p>— Wei Bingxin</p>
<p>He Meigu's wife was very superstitious. Her daily life consisted of burning incense at temples or worshiping Buddha in nunneries. Moreover, she specifically cleaned a room in her house to enshrine the Bodhisattva Guanyin. Every day, from morning to night, she respectfully faced the Bodhisattva Guanyin, chanting Buddhist scriptures and knocking on the wooden fish. The proper duties that a housewife should attend to were instead left behind. In this way, she naturally wasted time and money. Her husband, Meigu, strongly disapproved, and although he often persuaded her with kind words, it had no effect.</p>
<p>One day, Meigu suddenly thought of a gentle way to make his wife realize how annoying it was to chant Buddhist scriptures all day long. So, he repeatedly called out to his wife, "Madam!...Madam...Madam!..." He started shouting from morning and continued until dusk, without stopping.</p>
<p>This superstitious wife was also annoyed by her husband's constant calling. She angrily scolded Meigu, "What? Have you gone mad? Why are you making such a racket? Why are you always calling 'Madam,' making people's heads spin?"</p>
<p>"Haha!" Meigu laughed, "I only called you for a day, and you feel dizzy and annoyed, saying I'm crazy and scolding me for making a racket. But you face the Bodhisattva Guanyin every day, chanting her name thousands of times. Doesn't she feel dizzy? Doesn't she get annoyed, saying you're not crazy, and scolding you for not making a racket?"</p>
<p>He Meigu's wife, upon hearing these words, suddenly realized. From then on, she no longer mumbled Buddhist scriptures.</p>

<h3>Excellent Warships of Britain, America, and Japan</h3>
<p>— Tai Bin</p>
<p>It is said that in future wars, the navy will still play a powerful role. Therefore, the major countries of the world are not only desperately expanding their air forces but also actively expanding their navies. Among them, what deserves our special attention are, of course, Britain, the United States, and Japan, the so-called three major naval powers in the world, competing in the Far East.</p>
<p>The size of a country's naval power, of course, depends on the number and quality of its warships and their tonnage. Therefore, if we can know the situation of a country's warships, especially the excellent ones, then we can understand its naval power and its development direction. Now, what we want to report is, first of all, the situation of the existing excellent warships of these three major naval powers, Britain, the United States, and Japan.</p>
<p>Among warships, there are mainly four types: battleships (capital ships), aircraft carriers, Class A cruisers, and submarines. Britain, the United States, and Japan, of course, all have these types of warships, and they all have their own particularly excellent points. Let's explain them separately here.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about battleships. As far as we know, the existing representative excellent battleships of Britain, the United States, and Japan are as follows:</p>
<p>According to the above table, the first thing to note is that the British representative battleship is stronger than those of the United States and Japan in terms of displacement and the number of main guns. Originally, there was not much difference in the numerical values of the displacement, etc., of the main guns of the representative battleships of Britain, the United States, and Japan. For example, the British battleship has only one more 40-centimeter main gun than those of the United States and Japan, but even such a small numerical difference, just one more 40-centimeter main gun, can often sway the outcome on the battlefield. Moreover, the British Nelson-class battleship has three triple turrets, each turret equipped with three 40-centimeter main guns, all concentrated at the front of the ship. The representative battleships of the United States and Japan, on the other hand, are equipped with four turrets, each turret equipped with two 40-centimeter main guns; moreover, these four turrets are not concentrated at the front of the ship, but are located two each at the front and rear of the ship. Both of these arrangement formats have their advantages. Concentrating the turrets and main guns at the front makes them easier to command and defend, but it goes without saying that it is impossible to shoot at the stern of the ship. Conversely, placing the turrets and main guns at the front and rear of the ship, of course, makes it possible to shoot forward and backward. However, in the eyes of the designers of the British ship, in today's age of advanced electrical and mechanical technology, there is no chance to shoot at the stern of the ship. In addition, there are some differences in the speed and cruising range of the representative battleships of Britain, the United States, and Japan. But looking at the whole picture, the British Nelson-class ship is more powerful, and therefore it has the qualification to be called the world's number one battleship.</p>
<p>Next is the aircraft carrier. This is the mobile base of aircraft; its role is to sail near the territorial waters of the enemy country at great speed and carry out aerial attacks with aircraft. Although the existing aircraft carriers of Britain, the United States, and Japan are not very complete, their power is quite impressive. Now, let's mention the existing and representative aircraft carriers of these countries. Please see the table below——</p>
<p>Aircraft carriers also have artillery. As far as we know, the Japanese Akagi has ten 20-centimeter guns, and the Soryu has twelve 12-centimeter guns; the American Saratoga has eight 20-centimeter guns... But the primary function of an aircraft carrier is to transport aircraft, so its power is mainly determined by the number of aircraft it carries and their speed. From the above table, although we do not yet know the number of aircraft carried by the Japanese aircraft carriers Akagi and Soryu, based on the speed and the known number of aircraft carried by the British and American aircraft carriers, it can be said that the British and American aircraft carriers are more powerful than the Japanese ones.</p>
<p>The battleships and aircraft carriers seen above show that Japan seems to be less powerful than Britain and the United States. However, the situation with Class A cruisers and submarines is different. Now let's first make a comparison of the representative cruisers of Britain, the United States, and Japan——</p>
<p>The representative cruisers of Britain, the United States, and Japan in the above table were all completed in recent years. Among them, the British Arethusa was completed in September 1934, the American Astoria in August of the same year, and the Japanese Takao in May 1932. So they are all very modern. But if we compare these three, the Japanese Takao is superior to those of Britain and the United States. For example, the main guns installed on the British and American cruisers are eight or nine 20-centimeter guns, but the Japanese cruiser has ten guns of the same caliber; in terms of speed, the Japanese cruiser is also one or two knots faster than the British and American cruisers; and the armor plate of the main part is two inches for the British and American cruisers, but three inches for the Japanese cruiser.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>In terms of submarines, the Japanese are also more advantageous compared to the British and Americans. Comparing them in terms of combat power, the representative submarines of both Britain and Japan are equipped with one 12-centimeter gun, the speed of the British is 22 and a quarter knots, and the speed of the Japanese is 20 knots, while the American submarine has one 10-centimeter gun and a speed of 17 knots. In this way, the representative submarines of Britain and Japan both seem to be superior to the American one; at the same time, the British submarines are also inferior to the Japanese ones due to the lack of uniformity in the ship type. Therefore, Japan often boasts that its submarines are superior to those of the major powers.</p>
<p>Next, if we examine the overall picture, we can write down the following facts: Until recently, Britain had a total of 352 warships, with a total tonnage of 1,378,434 tons; including 15 battleships, 474,750 tons; 7 aircraft carriers, 279,880 tons; 194 destroyers, 235,944 tons, and 66 submarines, 67,114 tons. The United States had a total of 426 warships, with a total tonnage of 1,368,150 tons; including 15 battleships, 464,000 tons; 7 aircraft carriers, 146,500 tons; 19 Class A cruisers, 176,775 tons; 19 Class B cruisers, 160,500 tons; 366 destroyers, 325,155 tons; and 100 submarines, 91,920 tons. Japan had a total of 247 warships, 866,704 tons; including 9 battleships, 272,000 tons; 6 aircraft carriers, 88,420 tons; 14 Class A cruisers, 123,520 tons; 26 Class B cruisers, 144,375 tons; 122 destroyers, 152,270 tons; and 70 submarines, 86,049 tons. Regarding this, we cannot simply look at the numbers, because there is a distinction between new and old warships. As of now, if we compare them, Japan has the fewest old ships, followed by Britain, and the United States has the most. Therefore, Britain, the United States, and Japan are all working hard to build new ships to replace the old ones.</p>
<p>In the recent London Naval Conference, the conflicts between Britain, the United States, and Japan were very sharp. Regarding the main warships, Japan advocated reducing or even abolishing battleships, aircraft carriers, and Class A cruisers, which Britain and the United States both opposed; on the other hand, Britain and the United States advocated abolishing submarines, but this was opposed by Japan and France.</p>
<p>The result of such a struggle was that Japan withdrew from the London Naval Conference on January 15. Regarding this fact, if we carefully observe the above-mentioned warship situations of Britain, the United States, and Japan, and then examine the national conditions of Britain, the United States, and Japan and their positions and policies in the Far East, we can fully understand the truth. There is no need to say more here.</p>
<p>Now, Britain, France, and the United States have signed a naval treaty, and according to the US naval representative, naval competition can be avoided from now on. However, this treaty does not include Japan in the Far East, and Italy and Germany in Western Europe have not joined it. The so-called avoidance of naval competition is probably just nice to hear; because everyone knows that Japan, Germany, and Italy are currently the most vigorous in military expansion. Since they have left the naval treaty, world naval competition cannot be avoided; moreover, all the major powers in the world are now preparing for war. In fact, hasn't the British Conservative Cabinet already announced a plan to expand the navy on March 2? Hasn't the Japanese government after the coup increased the military budget? The so-called avoidance of naval competition is truly unknown from where to start!</p>

<h3>How to Be a "Proofreader"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Ling</p>
<p>"The study of collation" was done by specialized scholars in ancient times, such as Dai Dongyuan and Wang Niansun in the Qing Dynasty. Nowadays, with the development of printing technology, the progress of culture, and the meticulous division of various occupations, the work of the former specialized scholars—the study of collation—has now fallen into the hands of proofreaders. Naturally, the collation of the past was more troublesome and meticulous than the proofreading of today. It was not only necessary to correct the errors in words and sentences, but also to examine the authenticity of ancient books; just in terms of today's text and ancient text, it is impossible to correct ancient books without a thorough understanding of philology, not to mention the fact that there were many errors in the carving and copying of ancient books? However, we must not easily overlook the "proofreading" of today. Nowadays, because culture is global, the forms of writing, in addition to individual characters, also include some formulas and charts. Therefore, the work of "proofreading" seems to be very superficial and simple, but those who are experienced in this field will definitely say that without a calm and meticulous mind, without a considerable study of foreign languages, and without a considerable understanding of science and various disciplines, one cannot do proofreading.</p>
<p>To be a proofreader, one must first be proficient in Chinese characters and Chinese writing. The so-called "proficient" here does not mean being able to recognize the inscriptions on metal and stone, oracle bones, and ancient seal script, official script, and cursive script, or being able to write magnificent articles that are sonorous and resounding. However, one must be thoroughly familiar with the generally popular regular script—calligraphy—cursive script, running script, and the commonly used sentence structures and writing styles. If you can only roughly understand the words, but do not understand the content of the article or the form of the sentence at all, then when proofreading, you will have to compare the proofs and the original manuscripts, word by word and sentence by sentence. Moreover, if you do not correct the correctness or error of a certain word in the sentence based on the meaning of the whole sentence, but just read one word on the proof and point to and read one word on the original manuscript, then not only can you only proofread one or two thousand words per hour, which is very far from the rate, but also the result of your proofreading will be full of errors. Because there are many words in the original manuscript that can be typeset incorrectly, such as the word "為" (wéi, to do) and the word "水" (shuǐ, water), such as the word "為" (wéi, to do) and the word "歸" (guī, to return). Their shapes are similar in running script, so they are often typeset incorrectly by the typesetters. If the proofreader's level is equal to that of the typesetter, won't they be unable to proofread them? From this point of view, in addition to being able to recognize the popular regular script, cursive script, etc., one must also be able to generally understand the content of the text. In that case, not only can you not confuse the running script of words like "如" (rú, if) and "水" (shuǐ, water), but even if there are words in the original manuscript that were written by the author himself due to momentary errors, such as "homophones with different characters" or "similar in shape but different in reality," as well as "simplified characters" and "vulgar writing," you can boldly correct them, and you can be confident enough to do so. And if you have experience in proofreading, you will be able to discover certain words that people who write the original manuscripts often easily write wrong, and that typesetters often easily typeset wrong. From this, you can also derive some rules.</p>
<p>The second is to be careful. Don't think that just because you fully recognize the words on the proofs and generally understand their meaning, you can just proofread in a cursory manner. Little do you know that proofreading is by no means skimming or reading. Although we don't have to compare the proofs with the original manuscript word by word and sentence by sentence, we must never neglect even one dot or one stroke of a word or sentence, or the punctuation marks between and beside the words and sentences. Never forget that you are doing proofreading, not appreciating or understanding, because you are savoring and understanding the meaning of the text. You must know that interest and thought may sometimes make you deviate from the mechanical and meticulous proofreading work.</p>
<p>As soon as you unfold the proofs, you have your proofreading order. Never start reading in the ordinary reading method right away. First, you must pay attention to the "book margins" and look at the titles at the head of the book—the title or chapter headings of the book or article should be on the top of each page—and then look at the page numbers of each page. This is a task that must be repeated on each page, and never neglect it just because it is roughly correct, and this is also a place that is extremely easy to overlook. The second is to look at the titles of the chapters and sections. Here, you first have to prepare to recognize the number of the "character nails." If you don't know the special-size characters, size one, size two, size three characters, etc., you don't know which character to use for the main text, and which size character to use for a certain title. Even if the author or editor has written them on the original manuscript, if you are not fully familiar with them, you will not be able to correct the errors of the typesetters. Moreover, nowadays, there are still differences between size four characters and "new" size four characters, size five characters and "new" size five characters, etc., and there are also so-called italic characters and bold characters, etc. If you are not familiar with them, you cannot proofread them. The third is the "leading" of each section, which has a certain format, which depends on the author's interest. For example, articles are generally typeset with two lines of indentation, while poems have long lines and short lines, as well as two high lines and two low lines, such as quoting the separate leading of the article, or retracting four lines, all of which must be clear. There are also punctuation marks. Among them, there are periods, commas, semicolons, dashes, quotation marks, and names of people and places, and so on. To understand these, one can probably start proofreading.</p>
<p>When proofreading and finding an error, what form should be used to correct it and how should it be corrected? If there is no fixed method and order, sometimes even if you have corrected it, the error will still be there in the "second proofreading," or it will cause another new error. Therefore, a certain symbol should be used for a certain error. For example, if a word is wrong, it is indicated by "×"; if a word is omitted, a "∧" sign is added to the place where the word should be; if there is an extra word, it is erased with "○," and a long tail is drawn under "○" in a spiral shape. Different errors should be indicated by different fixed symbols to avoid confusion. Furthermore, the added words—such as the word that was "×" because it was wrong and the word that was added instead—must not be written next to the wrong word, which will not only make it unclear, but also lead to confusion. It must be clearly recorded on the "book edge" or "book margin" of the line occupied by the word—depending on whether it is "vertical typesetting" or "horizontal typesetting." If there are already wrong words in that line, or if there are several wrong words, then record them in order, distinguishing between the front and the back, so as to avoid replacing this correct word with a correct word that has been confused with another correct word, and causing new errors. In addition, there are also the reversals of words and sentences and the horizontal placement of an inverted word, all of which should be marked with a symbol indicating the error below or beside the word or number. It is best to record the corrected words in order on the book edge, enclosing them in parentheses to draw attention to them.</p>
<p>What is most easily overlooked and most easily mistaken in proofreading are Western characters and numerals. Because Chinese typesetters have a very shallow level of foreign languages, the first thing is that they easily confuse uppercase and lowercase letters, and the second thing is that they easily typeset "l" as "e," "a" as "o," and "n" as "u," because these letters are similar in cursive script. When proofreading foreign texts, don't be afraid that you know a certain word and can spell it out. If you are still a little unsure, then it is best to compare it with the original manuscript—of course, this is another matter for those typesetters and proofreaders who specialize in typesetting Western texts and have a good command of Western languages. Numerals have a great relationship with the book. For example, if one digit is wrong, it may cause the whole meaning to be wrong. When proofreading, there is no other way but to compare each word with the original manuscript. Because these are not sentences, and their correctness or error cannot be corrected by meaning.</p>
<p>There are still many places to pay attention to. When moving from one page to another, you must be especially careful. Most of the errors occur at the junctions. It is best to proofread the entire text or book once at the end, and correct the errors that were missed in the transitional places during each "proofreading submission." Before "going to the paper version," all the procedures that should be done must be done to avoid having to revise the version on the paper version. Before it has been printed and unbound, the entire book should be cleaned up to avoid the disadvantages of wrong stitching and inverted pages.</p>

<h3>Poison Gas Defense and First Aid</h3>
<p>— Strolling</p>
<p>The scars of the First World War have not yet healed, and the shrine of peace is already covered with bird droppings and insect dung. Some ambitious individuals even want to kick the statue of peace to the ground. Now, dark clouds are gathering in the sky. In the West, the Italian-Abyssinian war has opened the prelude to war. Hitler tore up the Locarno Treaty with both hands and brazenly marched troops into the demilitarized Rhineland. In the East, conflict has flared up on the Russian-Manchurian border. These are all harbingers of a coming storm. Furthermore, international relations, having lost the restraints of naval treaties, see each nation competing to strengthen its armaments. National defense budgets are expanding to the extreme in every country, so much so that the finance minister of one nation was brutally murdered for refusing to exhaust the resources of the country. The severity of the situation is clear.</p>
<p>Previously, the people of our country were anxious about the "Crisis of 1936," but the speed of developments has exceeded all expectations. When the next world massacre will officially begin, we cannot predict. However, observing the international situation, it is almost certain that war is imminent. Where this massacre will erupt, we also cannot foretell. However, we can be sure that anywhere on Earth could ignite a great war, and wherever it starts, the other side will surely follow. As for China's position in a major war, anyone with a slight understanding of the international situation knows. China's fertile land is also coveted by the surrounding powers.</p>
<p>All methods of warfare, whether ancient use of swords and spears or modern use of guns and cannons, despite the difference in weapons, ultimately aim to cripple the enemy's physique and incapacitate them for battle. This principle is consistent throughout history and across cultures. When two evenly matched nations unfortunately go to war, both sides hope to achieve a decisive victory in the shortest possible time. However, this is practically impossible. Therefore, they engage in intrigue and exhaust all methods. With ample time and abundant resources, they dig trenches deeper and construct fortifications stronger, transforming positional warfare into a war of attrition. With the advancement of science and the invention of steel plates, along with new tactics for dispersed troops, not only have swords and spears lost their effectiveness, but the power of firearms has also diminished. Under these circumstances, there is a pressing need to actively improve deadly weapons and methods of warfare. This involves abandoning projectiles that fly in a straight line and adopting a type of bullet that can curve around obstacles and injure enemies in concealed positions. Such an ideal bullet must be infinitesimally small, able to float in the air, and possess the characteristic of disrupting life functions upon contact with the enemy's body, rendering them incapable of further combat. These bullets are molecules of poison gas, the origin of chemical warfare. This term emerged during the First World War, when countries used over fifty types of poison gas, and countless more have likely been invented since. Judging from this, the next great war will undoubtedly be a chemical war. Isn't this something to be wary of? Therefore</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Therefore. Living in this extraordinary time, we must conduct substantial research into knowledge and methods of gas defense.</p>
<p>Here are some key aspects of gas defense:</p>
<p>I. Individual Gas Defense</p>
<p>Individual gas defense methods can be divided into two types: First, respiratory protection, using independent masks and filter masks. Second, skin and body protection. Independent gas masks, such as those with oxygen tanks, can isolate the wearer from external air. The oxygen needed for breathing is supplied by the tank, lasting from one to two hours. Alternatively, a hose mask can draw fresh, uncontaminated air through a hose.</p>
<p>II. Public Gas Defense</p>
<p>Public gas defense requires a good organization, which must be planned and prepared for in peacetime. Otherwise, when a gas war breaks out, people will be helpless. So this issue deserves our utmost attention now.</p>
<p>Recently, countries around the world have been urging the public to prepare masks to promote awareness of gas defense. However, it is practically impossible for every civilian in the rear to have a mask. Therefore, collective defense is the only viable option.</p>
<p>Collective defense involves housing large numbers of people in facilities with gas protection equipment, which is essentially a construction issue and should be prepared for in advance.</p>
<p>According to French building regulations, any theater must have a gas shelter before a building permit can be issued, for the future accommodation of refugees.</p>
<p>III. First Aid for Poisoning</p>
<p>Before being attacked by poison gas, it is best to adopt gas defense methods. If one is already poisoned, how to treat it is also an important question. The key points are introduced below: When rescuing, first transport the poisoned person away from the contaminated area so they can breathe fresh air.</p>
<p>Use a stretcher for transport, do not walk, and keep the distance short.</p>
<p>Ensure good air circulation during transport.</p>
<p>Be aware that some gases have an incubation period, so treat all cases, mild or severe, with utmost care.</p>
<p>Make the poisoned person lie down comfortably, loosen all clothing, and cover with a warm blanket or quilt.</p>
<p>Keep the poisoned person's clothing separate.</p>
<p>If breathing stops and it is definitely blood, nerve, or asphyxiant poison, perform artificial respiration.</p>
<p>If it is a skin poison (mustard gas, Lewisite), change into clean clothes and sprinkle talcum powder all over the skin, then wash it off. (Avoid getting it in the eyes, or blindness may result.)</p>
<p>Do not perform artificial respiration if it is an irritant or blistering agent.</p>
<p>All poisoned persons can be given oxygen, but do not force it in with pressure.</p>
<p>IV. Decontamination</p>
<p>During a gas war, whether at the front or in the rear, decontamination teams should be organized to handle all decontamination work.</p>
<p>For cities, wash with water and spread quicklime, about 300 grams per square meter. After two or three hours, all mustard gas will be eliminated. For trees, spray with chemical powder and then wash with water after two or three hours. Areas hit by bombs or shells should be sprinkled with quicklime and then filled in, using about one kilogram of quicklime per ten square meters of crater. For larger craters, adjust the amount accordingly. Wash wood with water, sprinkle with quicklime, and then rub with alcohol. Wash clothing and shirts in a soda solution and then boil them. Be aware of toxic water vapor during this process. Wash the walls of rooms with water and then apply a quicklime slurry. After 24 hours, wash with water again and ventilate.</p>
<p>Besides the above, the decontamination of food and drink is especially important. Any food that has been poisoned must be discarded or destroyed immediately. Do not risk your life by trying to salvage contaminated food. Poor people should pay special attention to this. Before drinking water, boil it for at least half an hour and then test it to make sure it does not contain traces of chemical warfare agents. If it does, it is not safe to drink, even after boiling. This is especially true of arsenic, which remains toxic even after boiling.</p>
<p>The best and cheapest disinfectant is quicklime, as mentioned above. However, it will become unusable for spreading if it clumps over time. There is a product called Lausantin, which is also made of quicklime, but it can maintain its spreadability even after years.</p>
<p>In summary, due to space limitations, this article cannot provide a detailed introduction and only outlines the key points. For the convenience of compatriots who wish to study this issue, I recommend the following two books, based on my knowledge: 1. "Chemical Warfare" compiled by Wu Hang (Jian Wu Edition); 2. "Common Sense of Gas Defense" (Zhonghua Edition).</p>
<h3>Trends in Children's Films</h3>
<p>— Jing Zhi</p>
<p>Children's education in China has always been backward. Although there have been calls to "Save the Children" and promotion of children's literature recently, no great achievements have been made in any area. Not to mention others, it is almost impossible to find a good children's film among domestically produced films with general educational significance. Therefore, psychological testing for general Chinese children is almost impossible. But the situation in Europe and America is different. Their general cultural level is higher than ours, and children's education is more popular than ours, so films about children are also very developed. From the general trends in children's films there, we can see the trends in the general psychology of children, and even the general social psychology of the world, because the psychology of children can be said to be a pure reflection of social psychology.</p>
<p>According to the League of Nations Committee on Child Welfare, the films most popular with children in the world recently are mainly adventure, comedy, mystery, and romance films. Among these, children in the UK, the US, France, and Italy, especially young girls, are particularly fond of romantic comedies. As for war and educational films, those have become things of the past. This fact shows the trend of children's psychology in Europe and the United States: The first is hatred and opposition to cruel wars. This mentality is undoubtedly a reflection of the general anti-war psychology of the world. The second is to seek stimulation and pleasure in adventurous, funny, mysterious, and romantic art. This can also be said to be a manifestation of the psychology of a part of the troubled and depressed society on the eve of this great era.</p>
<h3>The Prosperity of American Universities</h3>
<p>— Gu</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the number of students in universities and specialized schools in 44 states of the United States at the end of last year increased by 8.3% compared with the previous year; especially the universities on the Pacific coast, which increased by 10%. Regarding this matter, the American government, which does not tire of proving its prosperity, also declared that such an increase in the number of college students is evidence of prosperity. However, the so-called college students are mostly children from wealthy families. If the increase in the number of American college students can truly prove the country's prosperity, then the emergence of such prosperity is only an explanation of the fact that the rich in the United States are becoming richer!</p>

<h3>Research on Erhuang Opera</h3>
<p>— Zuo Zhou</p>
<p>We can hear such lyrics on the streets and alleys: "Thinking and thinking, I think of the past, how sad!" On the radio, on the gramophone, in the theater, we all hear the singing and acting of Erhuang opera. Many people's entertainment is spent here, and many people's historical knowledge comes intermittently from Erhuang opera, and many of the ideas of ordinary small and medium-sized citizens also come from this drama. So, it has research value.</p>
<p>Originally, Erhuang opera was a folk wild art. In recent years, it has gradually replaced the territory of Kunqu opera. Because although the words and sentences of Kunqu opera are gorgeous and the tunes are elegant and well-trained, ordinary people do not have the leisure to learn, nor do they have the level to appreciate them. Kunqu opera sentences cannot be popular, there are too many small tunes between one word and another, and the words are wrapped in the tunes, making it particularly difficult to understand. Erhuang, on the other hand, uses popular words and the tunes come after each sentence, so it is easy to understand. The sound of Kunqu opera is too low, only suitable for a small number of private performances, and cannot be popularized to the public. And the class flute sound is too subtle, so the voice must be lowered to suit it. Erhuang is just the opposite. Kunqu opera pronounces words too much, and the southern tunes mainly use Wu sounds, which are not easy to circulate. Erhuang is fair and accessible, close to language, and belongs to popular Mandarin. Although Kunqu opera is known for its gentleness and elegance, it is not as generous, ups and downs, tragic and happy as Erhuang, so it is easy to make people feel bored. For these reasons, Erhuang has invisibly taken over the territory of Kunqu opera.</p>
<p>In its early days, Erhuang was just a folk pastoral song, which was transformed into its current form after many modifications. It originated in Hubei, with Huangpi and Huanggang as the center. Then it spread from Hubei to Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong on one hand, and to Anhui on the other hand. Generally called Huguang tune. At first, Erhuang was just Erhuang. Later, influenced by Huizhou tune and Qinqiang, there was a contrast between Erhuang and Xipi. Erhuang tune, because it was influenced by various tunes, integrated and connected, was gradually transformed by the people of Hu from the original form into the current form, and then spread from Hubei to Anhui, and then from the people of Anhui to Beijing, and became Beijing Erhuang. There is more than one kind of tune in Erhuang opera. Kunqu, Ge (Jiangxi Geyang tune), and Qinqiang are all incorporated. Often many other tunes are infiltrated into a single play. The evolution and development of any folk art must go through such a process.</p>
<p>The strength of Erhuang opera is its simplicity, but its shortcoming is precisely because it is too simple. Because in terms of expression, the tune is too simple, and the sound does not match the plot, which greatly reduces the power of the drama being performed. Therefore, there are many famous artists who, because it is too inadequate, often create some short new tunes based on the pitch and tone of the word sounds, seeking to save these shortcomings between light, slow, and hurried. At the same time, they cannot help but seek help from the tunes of Kunqu, Ge, and Qin, and even the direct and indirect borrowings of daxiao and ballads. However, because of such mixing, swallowing whole, and failing to digest, Erhuang has now become a hodgepodge and is no longer its original form. In this evolutionary process, although Erhuang itself has become richer, it has been changed and cut by actors many times, and they often sing randomly, often exceeding the scope of Erhuang's original Ban Xipi Shuban, making the sound short and the organization superficial, like reciting an account book. This is completely ruining the original beauty of Erhuang opera. So now</p>
