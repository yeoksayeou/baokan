<h3>調整中日關係之前提</h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>中日間謀以會議爲入手進行調整關係之說就旬日間內外電訊觀察似有將成事實之趨勢在此趨勢進展中中國人之眼臉每一與此項新聞接觸其腦海中多不免浮起兩種疑問卽（一）在目前中日關係下欲恢復外交之正常狀態以成立眞實之不威脅不侵略而立於平等地位之中日會議事實上究竟是吾可能（二）使此項會議而眞能成立且有結果其於中國之利害究爲若何記者不敏鑑於去年此時以來在所謂廣田對華新政策及經濟提携運動中所發生之種種事件敢於斷言欲眞正調整中日關係解决中日問題必須先明其前提然後乃有希望之可言也</p>
<p>有吉大使之「新年所感」中對於中日關係之調整謂『……根本問題須兩國官民眞正認識兩國相扶相助始能增進兩國福祉始能維持東亞和平之依存關係若不由此項認識出發無論若何之調整方法結果不過敷衍一時而已』此爲日本外交家之言記者雖聽慣此類說詞然認爲在調整中日關係消息盛播中其言乃大有價値國人倘能明瞭其外交修辭外之眞意義則日本方面之態度於此可見其與廣田外相去年十一月間之對華三原則可以互相表裏中國人所欲問者此項認識與原則下之行爲應爲如何耳</p>
<p>中國人多數之見解以爲調整中日關係之障礙自有所在試以事實證之廣田外相去年一月中旬之對華新外交政策揭櫫不威脅不侵略眞正使中國立於對等地位獨立自主者中國當局亦曾如響斯應予以滿意之酬答而準備有所進行矣經濟提携之倡導中國人士亦曾忍痛贊同準備協作矣然而空氣轉變之中先之以五月底之華北問題繼之十一月間之所謂自治活動事實具在主持有人此種矛盾事伴之頻發如其爲國策所在兩面進行以爲澈底解决中國之方術則問題另有所在吾則障礙中日關係之人呼之可出中國官民無論如何認識扶助依存之意義究有何益乎</p>
<p>總之以外交方式調整中日關係就原理言自屬取途不誤其幸而有成則中國在領土完整主權獨立之條件下與鄰邦恢復舊好亦爲難得之事惟衆目所注對方之握有實力者頗欲以中國之命運爲其建立功勳之工具而其外交當局亦未能持獨特之高見以維持邦交於此而欲調整關係非鄰邦先有所覺悟確定眞正之善鄰國策遏止野心家之活動則前途光朋實有難言</p>

<h3>經濟業談</h3>
<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<p>生活標準與生活費用　（續）　趙人</p>
<p>生活標準不變，則生活費用之漲落由於標準中各種事物價格之漲落。生活標準亦變，則生活費用之漲落其情形較爲複雜。標準縮减而物價漲，則生活費用或漲或仍舊。標準高漲而物價跌，則費用或跌或不跌。標凖縮减而物價亦下降，則費用必减。標準高漲而物價亦上漲，則費用必大增。故研究生活費用者，必須指明某種生活標準，假定其不變，而按異時異地物價之漲落，以觀察生活費用之高低。德國統計學者恩格爾氏，於一八五七年分析歐洲工人家庭之收入及支出。首將生活標準中所包括之事物分爲五大類，一爲食物，二爲衣著，三爲居室，四爲暖具及燈燭，五爲雜項，雜項包括敎育宗敎津師保障健康運動娛樂等。繼按其收入之多寡而分析家庭費用之分配。共結論有四。一謂收入愈多，而食物之支出其百分數愈少。二謂收入愈多，用於衣著之支出其百分數無顯著之增减。三謂無論收入之多寡，其房租取暖燈燭之費用百分數絕無變動。四謂收入愈多，用於敎育健康娛樂等雜費佔全體生活費用百分數愈大。繼恩氏而起之各國社會學統計學家對於此種調查。無慮數百决，而瑞典且按期以法令作全國之家庭生活費用調查。吾國上海一埠，關於工人生活費用之調查，以財政部國定稅則委員會（前駐滬調查貨價處）之報告爲首决大規模之研究，繼之者有上海市社會局。其結論關於食物及雜項，與恩氏之第一第四者完全相同。衣著按收入之加增程度而其費用百分數顯有增進。房租及取暖燈燭費用所佔全體生活費用之百分數，則隨收入之增加而反示低落。此種研究不獨可以指示工人之生活及其豐嗇情形，更可示物價之變動，捐稅之輕重，影響於工人物質生活之大小。倘能就各種職業人員，硏究其生活標準與費用，則國民經濟之動態，胥可明瞭。但無論何國，此種調查，多數仍限於工人，以其調查工作較易，費用較省，而工人在工業國家中，亦佔最重要位置也。</p>
<p>國定稅則委員會及上海市社會局於調查工人生活之餘，復編製工人生活費指數，按月陸續宣佈。此項指數係先假定某種工人家庭，限制其人數，又假定其所銷耗之事物，無論量與質，均無變動，就中抽出若干物品，作爲生活費用之代表，按月調查其市價，同時考慮此項物品在生活標準中所佔之重要程度，而綜合平均之。爲比較起見，或先將各月物價與某一定時期之同物價格相除，化爲百分數，而後綜合平均。或以每月之綜合用費與某一定時期之綜合費用相除，而求其百分數。此項百分數卽表示每年各月與某一定時期相較而研究工人生活費用漲落若干。例如稅則委員會以一九二六年爲基本此較時期，在一九三二年生活費爲百分之一二六，卽假定工人生活標準不改，一九二六年僅須花一百元之事物，至一九三二年此同樣事物須費一百二十六元。今年各月指數繼續跌落，計自一月份百分之一一一跌至十月份百分之一〇四，假使工人生活標凖不變，收入不變，則生活費用在此數月中顯然减少，換言之生活應較前寬裕。但生活費之跌由於物價降落，而物價降落不利工商，或須减工停廠。工人收入未必不受影響。故生活費用之漲落，於工人爲禍爲福，未可武斷。生活費跌而收入增或仍舊，則工人較前舒適。生活費漲而收入跌或仍舊，則工人必感困難。或生活費與收入同時跌落，而前者更甚於後者，則於工人爲屬。倘生活費與收入同時上舐，而前者更共於後者，則於工人爲禍。生活費用上漲，間接引起工人要求增加工資。或規定最低工資，以生活費用爲衡量工具，其故卽在此也</p>

<p>倫敦　至本日午後為止、一般人對於海軍會議前途、頗形悲觀、盛傳日本對於他國提案、若仍堅决反對、致使海軍會議歸於失敗、而該國遂卽大增海軍軍備、則英法意美四國、擬卽訂立四國協定、以資應付、此項恊定、將載有「階梯式」之條欵、（卽四簽的國以外之國家、若增加海軍噸位、則四國卽可按照同樣此例、增加其海軍）、此間海軍界人士以為簽訂四國協定之主張、除英國而外、其他三國代表團均將表示贊同、蓋英國亟欲海軍會議繼續工作、任何代價均非所惜也、一般人並以為英國代表團對於任何計畫之足以延長會議時間者、卽如討論政治問題之類、亦已準備加以研究云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>東京　傳八日下午之軍縮會議委員會、美國曾附有某種條伴、同意法國建議、英美法意將藉共同戰綫對付日本、然日本海軍當局對於建艦計畫宣言案見解如下、</p>
<p>英國以為量與質之限制未能成立協定時、提議建艦計畫通吿案、希望成立協定、因此同意法意建議、故大有憑藉共同戰錢之可能性、　然該建議一如其名目之僅為通吿計畫、實際毫無限制、因此似有深意、欲對於若輩固執如斯姑息建議之態度、宜大事警戒、　如因對抗他國勢力之方策、理宜嚴守秘密、但在事前發表時、無論其為如何名案、已失秘密與效能、故極不利於劣勢之海軍國、　英國之注重點卽在此處、法國亦因對德而注重、故其眞意亦非發揮軍縮精神、且其目的亦非預留將來軍縮會議之地步、因此不能贊成該建議、（八日同盟電）</p>
<h3>法意提案內容</h3>
<p>倫敦　海軍會議法國代表團昨日建議、以各海軍國互相交　關於造艦程序之情報一項原則為基礎、成立海軍協定、意國亦根據此項原則、提出建議、本日午後五國海軍代表團分頭開會、將法意兩國所提建議、加以研究、據本社探悉、法國建議大要、主張各海軍國須以一年內造艦稈序先期互相通知、如遇有困難、則應互相諮詢、但各國所交換之情報、不必具有一般性質與包含長期間之造艦程序、又據英團方面所稱、法國建議尙包含一種可能性、卽各國造艦程序、當與其建造能力相適應、惟此種差別待遇、係以何種辦法為基礎、則尙不可知云、至於意國建議、亦主張各國以一年內造艦程序互相通知、但一年以後、是吾繼續交換情報、則未有規定云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本獨持異議</h3>
<p>倫敦　據英國海軍界人士聲稱、意法兩國所提建議、實屬大同小異、苟有成立妥協之可能、英國卽當努力調和意法兩國之見解、俾使互相接近、目前主要關鍵、卽在美日兩國之態度如何耳、美國方面以為當先由日本表示意見、然後美國代表團始可表明立塲、關於此節、日本政府發言人業於今晨對法國建議發表宣言加以批評、其所提異議計有兩點、　法國建議旣未規定减少海軍軍備之辦法、而對於日本所要求之平等權利、實際上亦未加以承認、　法國主張造艦程序、當與各國建造能力相適應、易言之、卽以預算能力限制造艦、此於日本尤屬有害、據海軍界人士所知、尙有一點亦為日本所反對、惟不便正式提出、卽法國建議一旦實行、則日本所置强有力之秘密軍備、勢必無從隱匿、果爾則日本海軍不僅在量的方面、較英美兩國為弱、卽在質的方面亦有遜色、此固非日本所能接受者也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　日本政府發言人今晨對海軍會議法國所提建議、發表宣言、加以批評法國代表團人士甚表詫異、謂法國提議之大綱甫於今晨提交各國代表團、其詳細節目尙未發表、日本批評似嫌過早云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英報觀察　海會成就難期</h3>
<p>倫敦　各報頃對海軍會議前途有所論列、除晨郵報表示樂觀外、每日電聞報與　日民聲報則均發出悲觀論調、晨郵報稱、「依照法國提案、各海軍國當將其一年內之造艦程序、予以宣佈、似此則海軍會議最大問題之一、卽量的限制問題、當可因之而得一解决矣、」至每日電聞報則稱、「法國主張各國互換造艦程序之情報、然其所宣佈者、僅為擬造各艦之噸位、速率與砲位三項數字、他如關於各艦戰鬥力方面之細目、卽各國向所認為應嚴守秘密者、則仍不能予以發表耳」又每日民聲報載稱、「海軍會議現已陷於驚濤駭浪之中、其距顚覆之期、已不在遠、此後陷於僵局、原屬無可避免、各國代表團雖曾竭智盡慮、以冀渡過難關、惜均先後失敗、此固無可如何者也」云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日垂涎英屬地　東京報紙對英猛施抨擊</h3>
<p>倫敦　每日捷聞東京訪員報吿、日本報紙對於英國猛施攻擊、甚日主張日本攫取已經「衰老的」英國屬地、據稱此等報紙力稱英國之軍備實業均已衰弱、不能開發屬地、而日本則方在土地飢荒之中、「國民新聞」且謂日本開發亞洲南部、儘有與英國衝突之機會、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>巴黎　法國軍事當局不肯公布英法參謀本部會議結果、當局祇謂新近之討論、「兩國專家在友誼上作普通交換意見而已、」法國外部發言人對報界記者謂、英法兩國根據國聯盟的第十六條第三段規定互柑合作抵　公敵之條文、研究兩國之合作可能性、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　當國聯十八人委員會於一月二十日在日內瓦開會討論對意油禁時、法國第一第二分艦隊將在地中海舉行大操、第一分隊擬在泊羅文斯與柯西加海濱外操練、第二分隊先擬游　於加薩白蘭加外、然後會合第一分隊、現信此項運動乃法國屢决承允英國地中海艦隊如為意國攻擊、法艦隊常予援助之後果、同時第二分隊各艦長將於今日在白萊斯集議、作紙上之談兵、大的將議及如第二分隊在一月十四日開往加薩白蘭加之前突被攻擊、則應取何戰略問題、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍部頃宣稱、戰艦「納爾遜號」「羅德尼號」（各三四〇〇〇噸）航空母艦「震怒號」巡洋艦「開羅號」曁驅逐艦第二十一分隊、定於本月中旬舉行春季大操、此外戰艦「霍特號」巡洋艦「雷　號」「奧尼翁號」「海王號」等數艦、卽將自地中海駛回本國云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英參謀本部主張　對意實施油禁　認為制止戰爭唯一良法</h3>
<p>巴黎　據「觀察」報本日發表倫敦消息、英國參謀本部以為實行油禁、為一停目意阿戰爭之良法、該本部復以為因下列原因、意阿之爭必須停止、　如戰事延長、意軍必終受重大損失、　如黑種在戰事上勝於白人、其不良影響於殖民地國家非常重大、以英國而論、則增加埃及巴力斯坦及印度之國民運動、　欲保存歐洲列强均勢、意大利在歐洲勢力不應减少、　意大利之經濟復興、多賴英國借欵、此種經濟政策不可一日毀止、以故參謀本部催促英政府力主油禁、該報復謂、倫敦日內瓦及巴黎空氣均贊成此議、故一月二十日開會之國聯理事會定必通過此案、而定於二月一日實行、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　今晚為國聯開會討論對意油禁之前外、各方宣稱、希望意阿戰事從速結束者當以英國參謀部為最、據稱、制止戰事之最佳辦法、莫若斷絕意國之軍火接濟、允當杜絕油。棉花及彈藥之接濟、逐漸使其感覺重要接濟品之不足云、法國當局相信英國之態度、現為埃及騷動漸趨嚴重所束縛、此外尙時須顧慮德意之携手、同時此間專家確信油禁不致在二月一日前實施、因必須等候美國具體决定共中立政策故也、（七日國民電）</p>

<h3>上海之橡膠業　（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國信所主編</p>
<p>（四）製品分類</p>
<p>現有各廠除協康廠外，幾以鞋類為主要產品，且不乏以套鞋為唯一出品者，至於套鞋以外，兼製其他者，或膠鞋·或跑鞋·或皮球·或滾筒·或熱水袋·或玩具·或皮管·或晴雨鞋·或運動鞋·或機器用品·或醫藥用具·或兼製一種·或兼製數種·惟協康一家，以其幹部人物，胥本埠人力車界中堅份子，故其出品亦僅人力車胎一種，近年來橡膠業在民族工業中，已佔重要地位，惜同業過多，又値市面衰落，生產過剩，勢所必然，業此者倘能移其焦點，改絃易轍，改嚮其他產品發展，或亦轉機之一道也，</p>
<p>（五）產銷狀况</p>
<p>估計橡膠品產量，頗為困難，旣不能以其價値為標準，蓋年來市價逐步低落，價値數字之升降，不足以表示眞正之產量，且鞋類以外之產品，以其計數單位之不同，及形式大小之互異，復乏精密之統計，故本篇所談，即以鞋類為代表，以鞋類固為橡膠品之重心也，該業在極盛時代，每日鞋類產量，達八萬雙以上，本年五六月間，降至每日八千雙，相差乃達十倍，銷路方面，以長江流域為主，華北及南洋次之，華南則港粤均有製造廠之設立，不易問鼎也，自本年六月份起，該業略見昭蘇，迄七月份止，全市四十六廠停工達三十二家者，大部已逐漸復工，初則以中央勦匪軍雲集川中，跑鞋一項，需要孔殷，故川帮進胃頗濃，繼則閩省盛行球鞋，閩帮採勢亦勁，過去市上存貨，當達四百萬雙以上，近已不及半烽，實銷發動，固為主因，而各廠經濟緊蹙，無力囤積存貨，亦不無關係。以我國人口之多，購買力之蘊蓄，未可限量，誠能加以扶植，精益求精，同時對外來貨品，設法提高關稅，以增加其成本，則橡膠業前途，固非不可為也。（未完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（四）（六）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>內中有不少同志頗贊同內達的淤見，然而裴先生還是不錯的；乃德或許寗可當場招認，把這件事爽爽快快過去，因為便是他父親給他最利害的一頓鞭打，比起他現在到處遇到的冷淡，走避及一般的嫌猜，還比較好受些。他身雖在這裹，郤如被流放到無人之境；說來也希奇，雖然沒有人對他舉起過一隻手，或說過一句話，然而他在這一星期裏郤受到了極深的痛苦，日子也覺得格外長，總像是不肯過去的樣子。</p>
<p>最壞的地方就在這裏；假如他們索性明白說了出來，或竟把他痛打一番，比起那放在每個臉兒上那種靜嘿的不信任，還覺容易忍受些。便是裴夫人的臉兒上也見到那種不信任的痕跡，雖然她的舉止裏還是差不多和以前一樣慈和；至於裴伯伯眼裏一種担憂的神情直刺人乃德的心坎，他原很敬愛他的敎師的，知道現在他那樣不幸事件郤已使他完全失望了。</p>
<p>全家只有一個人仍舊對乃德有十分的信任，不管其餘一切的人意見怎樣，郤忠勇地站在他的方面。這就是小梅。她不能說明為什麽她能　過一切的跡象而仍舊相信他，她只覺得她是不能疑心他的，而她一腔熱烈的同情使她願為他辯護而不辭。他不願聽人說他不是，無論是誰說的，她確曾打過她親愛的哥哥小橋，當他要使她相信這必是乃德做的，因為更沒有別人知道錢的所在。</p>

<h3>一年來之外匯</h3>
<p>— 祠</p>
<p>自一九二九年九月華爾街證券風潮爆發，誘動世界經濟恐慌開始以來，各國相繼放棄金本位，同成挽救恐慌一致之手段，其間雖有金集團（Gold　Bloc）諸國之抗立，然其內國經濟不振之狀態，一似證明此種趨勢之不可違逆故，加塞爾敎授（A.　Cassel）有言曰，「世界景氣之不能恢復，實乃金集團諸國固執金本位之過也」，</p>
<p>放棄金本位，就一般之解脫，對內為通貨膨脹，對外為匯價跌落，其目的乃為刺激生產及增進輸出（註一）。然放棄金本位亦有不必即為膨脹通貨者，吾人試一檢查一九三一年後之英國及一九三三年後之美國，其發行數目皆甚平穩，並未有急鉅之增加（註二）。良以近數年來各國之與金本位脫離，實與大戰期中放棄金本位之目的不同，大戰時各國之放棄金本位，乃為財政上之目的，故有膨脹通貨之必要（或者可謂為其積極之企圖），而近數年來各國之放棄金本位，乃欲以貶低外匯之方式，為增進輸出之助力，而國內扶助工商業發展之方式至多，固不必出諸增加發行一途也。</p>
<p>欲以貶低外匯而達到增進輸出之目的，同時須顧及國內貨幣購買與物價之關係，換言之，必須使本國貨幣購買力在國內外發生不同之差額，始能發生促進輸出之作用，一般情形，在一國貶低外匯時，其貨幣在國內國外之購買力均形跌落，而當此之時，可能發生下列三種不同之形態。</p>
<p>本國貨幣在國內之購買力降落，小於在外國之購買力。</p>
<p>本國貨幣在國內之購買力降落，等於在國外之購買力。</p>
<p>本國貨幣在國內之購買力降落，大於在國外之購買力。</p>
<p>上列三種情形，僅在第一種情形下，能促進輸出之增加，即貶低外匯，本國貨幣在國外之購買力降落（反之為他國貨幣購買力之提高），大於在國內購買力降落之程度，如為第二種情形，則殊無若何影響，而在第三種情形，則不特不能促進輸出，反有擴大國內市塲之可能也。（未完）</p>

<h3>迎「市民國貨年」</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>希望</p>
<p>開拓海外市塲　推廣邊區銷路</p>
<p>空言無補事宜實踐</p>
<p>多災多難的「學生國貨年」，終於很輕快地消逝了，前進的時間軌道上，正寫着「市民國貨年」五個大字，國貨運動的大事表上，又可添增了新的一頁，我們大衆的視錢，自然又要集中在本年，本年，本年，這前程遠大的本年啊！</p>
<p>誰也曉得，過去的國貨運動，是一個可痛之謎，從開始怒吼的「國貨年」，和「婦女」，「學生」兩大國貨年，到「市民國貨年」這三年來的成績，在我們目前的檢討裏，是無疑義地慘淡而黯澹，是事倍而功半，但是，在斬荊除棘的過程中，我們也千萬別忘了努力國貨運動的人們，他們埋頭苦幹，積極進行，也早奠定了現代工業的雛型，允其是在去年一年中，入超的减少，出口的漸增，事實已很明顯地吿訴我們，熱烈的國貨運動，已在廣泛的社會民衆間，獲得偉大的愛護和擁戴，同時，對外貿易的好轉，給予國貨前途一個光明的路徑，新貨幣政策的施行，賜予產業界一個重大的刺激，可决定我們今後國貨進展的動向。</p>
<p>所以，在「市民國貨年」的展望上，我深深地覺得，我們今後的工作，應該一方面由產業界確定具體計劃，努力進行開拓海外市塲與推廣邊區銷路，深入內地，一方面允應喚起全體人士，對於崇拜洋貨心理的摒棄，要知道這是什麽時候了，外貨傾銷，已到要吞滅我全民族生存的時機，我們還能再做物質享受的迷夢嗎？經濟狂潮的挽回，是要每個人起來盡責的，歷史敎訓我們：「空言無用，事重實踐，」我們現在是一定要從理論而到實踐的階段上去。</p>
<p>最後我謹以十二分的熱誠，希望木年的成績，勝於過去，並且深望全國人土以更深的暸解，認淸了目前我們經濟的國難，國貨運動是我國整個民族生存的問題，所以無論標榜共為「婦女」「學生」和「市民」而他的發展增長，總要以全國大衆的力量為後盾，團結一致，漸决實行同業合作和產銷合作，及金融界合作，向成功的大道上，很勇敢地前進。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨要自「我」做</h3>
<p>— 筱石</p>
<p>黃任之先生曾這樣說：「要人家做，我先做；不許人家做，我先不做」。這幾句話，原是指一切事情而言，其意義，簡單說一句，就是「以身作則」。吾想要使人人愛用國貨，也逃不出這個原則：你要勸人愛用國貨，不如自己先愛用起來，你要勸人不買外貨，不如自己先不買起來。人人能如是，就可做到人人愛用國貨，人人不買洋貨。</p>
<p>吾有一個好友，他在社會上，很有地位，有一决，吾見他穿了一件很新的外國嗶嘰袍子，吾就這樣說：這件衣服想來一定是數年前做的，棄之誠哉可惜！他很老實的回答吾，不是，是新做的，咦！這又奇了！這不是和你平時提倡國貨之宗旨相背嗎？吾這樣鄭重的問他，他笑而不答。吾想類似這種事寔，豈獨吾的朋友為然，恐滔滔者，天下皆是也。這樣的能言而不能行的提倡國貨，寔在是推行國貨前途的隱憂，故吾的意思，今後提倡國貨，要勉勵人人自「我」做起。</p>
<p>假使我是一個敎職員：應先從我本身做個好榜樣，凡是用的，吃的，穿的，不論屬於公有的，或是私有的，非國貨不用，做全校的模範，久而久之，全校的人，一定會得被其同化。不然，非但言論不響，就是一時騙過大衆，結果一定毫無成效。</p>
<p>假使我是一個商人：要明白多販一些國貨，就是為國家多留一分元氣，凡是國貨的新出品，和可以代替洋貨的國貨，應當儘量的推銷介紹。倘或徒顧一己的利益，廣銷洋貨，甚或改頭換面，欺騙顧客，這是奸商的行為，非愛國的商人，所以出此。</p>
<p>假使我是一個工人：凡建築材料，製造原料，有國貨可朵用者，應盡量取用。例如近年以來，工人貪工作之便利，用洋松建屋，或製一切應器具，致本國木材，銷路一落千丈。諸如此類，全賴工人之提倡，以促起顧主之覺悟。</p>
<p>假使我是一個農人：吃的要吃自已種出來的稻麥，不要再吃洋米洋麵，穿的要穿自己織出來的土布，不要再買洋紗洋布，用的耍用自己國內所產的國貨，不要再用洋油洋燈洋火。全國農人，都能如是，農村不會再憂破產。</p>
<p>假使我是一個婦女：凡衣食住行所需的日用品，何者為國貨，何者為洋貨，都要辨別得很淸楚，要抱定非國貨不用的主見。家中增添一洋貨，就是一家的奇恥大辱，娶媳帶一些洋貨來，就不是賢媳，嫁女帶一些洋貨去，就不是賢女。全國婦女，人人能作如是觀，國貨的顧客，已得全國人民的半數矣。</p>
<p>婦女國貨年，學生國貨年，已成過去的陳迹，市民國貨年，乃是未來的新機。自今以後，全國同胞，人人抱定提倡國貨，自「我」做起的决心，吾想二十五年的國貨，一，定會得推行全國，國民經濟，也一定會得慢慢的發展，國運前途，一定會得復與。吾願以此自勉，更願盡吾責任，勉吾兄弟子女，勉吾親戚朋友，勉吾日常交接的社會大衆。大家一致起來吧！要渡過一九三六年的難關，要復興中華民族，先耍自「我」做起來提倡國貨。</p>
<h3>賀年片</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>難道必須用外國紙，不可以用國産品麽？</p>
<p>新年之中，吾看見生意經最熱鬧的，要算小小的一張賀年片，到是像交了時運亨通的際遇，挨着門市上佔了第一位的出品呢！你不看見不論那一家書店，和印刷所的玻璃櫃架裹，都陳列五顏六色的許多片子麽？哼！倘若細心地去瞧，眞要使人目迷，不辨是那一種算最覺當行出色哩！</p>
<p>據一位朋友對我說：這秤片子，銷路雖是一年一度實在統計起來，那消費的數量，至少的百萬元以上，這不是一件可驚的事麽？吾後來問他？那末：這種片子所用的原料？是國產呢？還是舶來貨呢？他不是做外國紙店生意，原來很熟悉的，縐着眉，答道：賀年片的紙張，可選擇質厚光滑，方能合用，國內自製的貨品，都不相宜，只能拿外紙來充當，是沒有辦法的。而且片子上面，要印上極美麗的彩畫，方能悅目；所以為了這兩個原因，如其要拿國紙來做這樣東西，是非當困難的。吾聽了運一番話，不山得心弦上吃了一驚，賀年片，原來是很細微的于樣應酬品，尤其是一年止有一個新年而銷耗的外流，竟然到這步地位，那還好了得麽？</p>
<p>吾又因此想到這賀年片，不但是這樣片子上的損失，覺得可惜，還要加上一個封套，和半分郵票，這幾天裏，就算這一大宗來來去去片子，不算便罷，拿全國計算，恐怕這幾個數字，吾也不能就便寫了。靑年學生們，有時寫上幾句祝頌的吉祥語，一不留意，自覺錯訛，還要塞到字紙筆裏去，雖是出錢買來的眞會不肉麻哩！允可笑的，國歷新年，曾經飛過一次片子，到了廢曆，又要再來一下，這眞是太無意識了。</p>
<p>唉！賀年？禮俗上或許是不可少的一回事。不過吾以為在這年頭兒，固然是未不及了；明歲一年裏，趕快想出一種很適用的國產紙料來，排除外貨，挽回利權，就算不及他的美觀，須曉得賀年片，本是虛偽的酬應品，只要能表示些意思，沒有什麽重大的關係？退一步講：不論那一輩子，一切的一切，國難嚴重的當兒，還能顧到賀年片上麽？記得前年在某君處，案上有一片桃色的賀柬，內容是很腥紅而鮮艷，還寫着一行Happy　new　year那旁邊偏偏批上了『不算你有禮，適見你無恥；』吾初不懂這個道理，他老人家說：『小兒無恥，不曉得今歲是國貨年，出此醜事；』像這種敎訓，眞値得提起，為給予讀者們看看。</p>
<h3>覩物思人與覩物思國</h3>
<p>— 昭</p>
<p>天寒歲暮！又逢年節！投桃報李，維繫情誼，吾們親友間，究竟餽送些什麼禮物好呢？</p>
<p>室邇人遐！我勞如何？勞念親友，還是餽些國貨吧！他喜運動的，便購回力球鞋或檯球拍等…………他好文字的，便購博士牌自來水筆，國貨墨汁，和各種應用寔學的參玫書籍等……她愛美的便贈蝶霜，三星牙膏，嫦娥化妝品，三角牌香皂，繡花錢枕套等………備贈老年人的，如五洲魚肝油，四川銀耳，興化桂圓，湘蓮，紅棗等……備贈兒童的，如康元罐廠飛機等各種玩具，和飛機帽，兒童故事畫等……務使婦，孺，老，幼，覩物思人，覩貨思國（註：道地的國貨）在新氣簇簇的新年裏，皆大歡喜！</p>
<p>餽贈的時候，最好寫黏警惕的字句在禮品上，如「此區區係完全國貨，請你牢記」或「敬獻國貨的小小禮品，祝你快樂！」或「敬贈土產，恕不奉送舶來品，請你努力宣傳國貨」等字樣，吾想大家覩物思人，覩貨思國，定有意想不到的收穫啊！</p>
<h3>一年中我計劃的回顧</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>記得在學生國貨年開始的時候，我曾為本刊寫過一篇「學生國貨年的計劃」，現今好容易一年又捱過了，而所做的成績，還沒有完全達到，想起來眞是十分慚愧。現在且把一年中我對於國貨所做到者，做一個國貨年結尾。</p>
<p>組織一國貨參觀團：本年度所參觀過的，有龍華水泥廠，龍章造紙廠，昆明釀造廠，中國化學工業社，泰康食品公司，中央造幣廠，以及製釘，電木，玻璃，鞋帶，等小工廠。給我們的印像都頗佳。當有人耍購買日用品，我們竭力勸他用國貨來代替。雖然效力很微，不過我們的目標是從小處着想，假使每個同學都一致總動員起來，那成績一定是很可觀的。現在團員共有二十五個，其中最努力的有俞百祿。陸象賢。沈承昭·劉隆士·諸君，他們曾努力地帮助我接洽參觀工作。</p>
<h3>爲誰辛苦？</h3>
<p>— 士萼</p>
<p>二，發行一討論國貨的壁報：我們本來打算出一種油印的刋物，以討論國貨及靑年修養為宗旨，一因為收效少，第二因為麻煩大。我們都是在讀書的靑年，時間和力量都是十分少的，所以單出一種壁報，定名野草，社長俞錫南君副社長俞百祿君辦事十分認眞。可惜外稿不多，所以進行很慢。</p>
<p>三，成立一個國貨研究會：我們研究國貨以考察國貨的製造過程為第一目的，一方面，又由會中購買關於民族工業實况的書籍，已購置者的三四十種，每半個月，檢點過去工作一决。常為本　　刋寫稿的菱湖昭·賢。寄雨。諸君，就是會員之一，現在會巾暫分三部：調查部，總務部，會計部，山陸象賢。沈承昭·任由三君主其事。</p>
<p>過去的成績就是這樣，未來的我認為還有許多事可幹。其中所碰的釘子也很多，有許多同學，雖然也明知國貨在這個地步，非靠國人下一個决心不可，不過，在他個人的生活中，好像買外國貨反為榮耀的一伴事。說起中國的文且用品，就趕忙搖頭連說「不行。」勸他購國貨，好像以為騙他似的，這種不可理喻的人，眞是國貨運動的大障礙！不過就大體說，同學們用國貨的心理，確已增進不少了。</p>
<p>光陰荏苒，一年又過了。聽說明年巳定為市民國貨年，我希望全國各城市鄉市的同學，仍舊繼續下去擔負起我們的責任！</p>
<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>希望大家來幹</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>莫再趨時尚　毋忘國貨年</p>
<p>滬巵今未塞　愛國共荷肩</p>
<p>恭喜！恭喜！且慢！喜從何來？普通慣例，每逢新年開筆，做文章的人總不免要寫幾句吉祥語，希望話，記者今天未能免俗，也要胡　幾句來祝賀祝賀，至少要說幾句希望語，可是想了半天，還沒有想出來。瞪了眼，倒回想過去了，記得民國二十二年，本刋誕生的一天，這年公定爲國貨年。二十三年公定爲婦女國貨年。二十四年公定爲學生國貨年。「國貨年定，名稱各不同，問君成績在？搔首總成空」。這雖是一位老先生的消極話，可是慨乎言之，我們參加運動的人，少不免有些慚愧。不過許多國貨廠的領袖，總是說能够大家鼓動，使社會上熱閙一些，舌頭焦，唇兒敝，多少可以使奸商的膽寒一些，時髦的公子哥兒腦子淸醒一些，摩登的小姐少奶奶心腸轉變一些，這幾年來雖不時見着化妝品進口數百萬，文具儀器進口數百萬，國貨運動似乎還沒甚功效，可是退一步想，幸虧大家來提倡一下，數目字還少一些，否則恐怕要有數千萬元的進口貨，還不北這些數目咧。所以天下事只有「幹」，纔是道理，纔有出路，國貨年要幹，婦女國貨年也要幹，學生國貨年也要幹，「幹」是自力更生的一條大路，生為中國人，遭此惡環境，死裏求活，絕處逢生，只有大家來「幹」</p>
<p>今年是國貨年第四個年頭了，有的定為市民服用國貨年，有的定為國民國貨年，有的說內地國貨年，有的說海外國貨年，我說都是好的，市民應服用國貨，內地同胞迺至海外同胞全國國民都該服用國貨。同屬國民，何分彼此，何分界限。不過莫忘了下面的五個條件：</p>
<p>應集中力量，一致合作，不應各抱目的减損幹的能力。</p>
<p>應實心實力，為羣工作，為公服務，不應藉用名義，自便私圖。</p>
<p>應為國貨界力謀便利，减少負擔，不應使國貨界或提倡國貨者受無謂之損害，反生厭惡。</p>
<p>應以犧牲精神，義務觀念，從事此國貨運動，不應藉此歛錢，滋擾工廠。</p>
<p>應求運動之普及，効力之周徧，不應枝枝節節，限於一隅。</p>
<h3>敬吿國貨工廠</h3>
<p>本刋茲為介紹國貨，以供各地愛用者之採擇起見，擬按期刋載一業中之著名國貨工廠出品，以利宣揚，而示提倡。敬請</p>

<h3>貢獻與閩浙贛三省紙商（上）</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>二十四年的六月間，我在西冷蝶來飯店歇夏，老友戚餘三君來說，湖墅一帶的紙商，所受影響，已到山窮水盡之際，非得想個方法來挽救一下不可，我就主張機製與手工合作，但見不成事實，經傳空談，及至十二月間，申新兩報登了幾天三省紙商的廣吿，我又想到這一個大題目了，大概不成事實的第一原因，他們只想紙廠家收賣原料，造成了紙，再由紙商去賣，這一種如意算盤，可是萬打不通，紙廠家賒進木漿，造出紙來賣錢，豈不簡便，誰肯去向農村放欵，收買原料，就我所知，三省之中，所產的紙，要算我們浙江最决的了。</p>
<p>我們浙江地方，產紙區域雖多，但是向他們去買竹料，莫不視為奇貨可居，因為滬料只在小滿節的一個時期，他要自備一年的用途，賣給與你，他就自己失了工作的原料，所以也難怪他，核其成本，每用靑竹八九百斤，造成白竹絲一百斤，工資的一元七八角，靑竹之價每千斤不過半元，加以應用石灰，總計不過兩元半耳，他們造成舊式的紙張，向來總要賣到四五元一祖，雖然是人類所不願用的，但是燒與鬼時，也就沒人批評好歹，所以專靠在迷信上走着一條死路，而在迷信的人，雖然逐年减少，但仍有人要去買他，因為機製的紙灰是黑的，不是白的，所以說是鬼不要用，不過迷信的人一年年的死了去，世上賸着的迷信朋友，因而减少，他的銷路，也就年年减少，僅等於零，浙江省的紙，都是黃色的，只有江山縣屬的浦城一帶，因為不產石灰，要向遠處買來，灰價輕而脚力重，所以不用石灰，利用若天時地利，施行他們天然漂製工程，雖然費時，但是成本反輕，出品反而要好，因為他們自己不會抄紙，專靠江西帮的紙據前來收買去造白紙，這一種的做法，大概還是江西人所傳授的呢，不過近年以來，白紙銷路也被機製紙佔奪了去，所以浦江一帶的人們，也就陷於失業，江西人不去放本收買，也就沒人再做，再過幾年，一定和打米郞一般，老手死完了，再恐造就一班人手來做，可就難了，我曾細細核算過來，浦城收料，運到江山，轉到杭州，每担成本至多不過三元，每三担的一担紙，也不過九元，總計不過每噸一百五十元，比之木漿還得便宜一些。</p>

<h3>論胡適的「四十自述」</h3>
<p>— 林一平</p>
<p>胡適先生近一二年來對於「傳記文學提倡的很起勁。他以為傳記文學是一塊未開發的園地，只要這塊園地開發了，文壇上就會增加萬丈的光芒，文化上就有了無價之寳，所以他苦心孤詣的說：</p>
<p>『我在這十幾年中，因為深深的戚覺中國最缺乏傳記的文學，所以到處勸我的老輩朋友寫他們的自傳。』</p>
<p>他勸林長民先生寫「五十自述」，『不幸他慶祝了五十歲的生日之後，不上半年就死在郭松齡的戰役裏，』勸梁啟超寫「自傳」，『誰也不料那樣一位生龍活虎一般的中年作家只活了五十歲！』勸梁士詒寫一部「自叙」，結果也成了他的「夢想」，再勸蔡元培。張元濟·高夢旦·陳獨秀……等，他們都沒有作出；最後好像勸的沒法再勸了，於是我們這位有「傳記熱」的胡博士為着『可以使我們文學要添出並數的可讀而又可信的傳記來』，為着『給史家做材料，給文學開生路』，在他所謂『我們拋出幾塊磚瓦，只是希望能引出許多塊美玉寳石』之情形下，就毫不吝惜筆墨×來替我們寫他的『四十自述』。</p>
<p>據作者自己說，他『這四十年的生活可分作三個階段，留學以前為一段。留學七年（一九一〇－一九一七』為一段。出國以後（一九一七－一九三一）為一段。』但是我們看到的只是他寫成的第一段。</p>
<p>在第一章是取的小說形式。雖然技巧上不大成熟，但是作者能够毫不顧忌的，純客觀的，把自己父母訂婚的經過，由傳聞的所得一一寫了出來，這却是前人所未有的。我們知道中國是撒遍舊禮敎種子的國家，歷來別說不准兒子談說自己父母的秘密，就是連父母的名字，私下也諱言的；甚而有的人為了別人在自己面前呌了自己父母的名字，因而與人家訴之於武力者。而作者在本文中竟把他的父親－「三先生」，他的母親－「馮順弟」，當成一篇小說中的主角隨便去寫，可知若非能看破舊禮敎的人，决難出此。</p>
<p>第二章以下，一律是取的自叙的形式。從他的生日寫起，一直寫到他考取了出洋。在這幾章的叙述中，大體上還頗能赤誠的，重新的燃起他童年的心火，把自己過去所處的遭遇，所受的敎育，所吃的苦痛，所有的思想變遷的過程，畫一個簡單的輪廓。但是細細檢討起來，其中有幾點不能讓我們滿意？</p>
<p>一，故鄉的自然環境毫無提及：任便是多麼偉大的人物，他最初所處的鄕土，對於他幼年的影饗是很大的。作者旣是生在鄉間－不是一生就居上海，那在自述的開始，就應該先把自己所居的自然環境寫一寫。可是作者壓根就沒提一個字，這不能不說是一個小失處。</p>
<p>二，缺乏文學的意味：所謂傳記的文學，是應該用生動的筆墨，活潑的文字，把自己過去的實生活來淋漓的描繪一下。要是像作者在『九年的家鄉敎育』中的寫法，那實在呌我們難以「呌好」。因為他所寫的太乾枯了，太無意味了，我們只覺光緒…年×月」，「西歷…年」一類的數目字充滿了篇幅，再也想不到是讀的「傳記文學」。這種紀年紀月的寫法，在百年後也許會成了好的材料，但是我們不相信這樣的作品會給文學開生路的。</p>
<p>三。叙述上有的地方矛盾：用追叙的方法來作自己的自述，依照自己的年齡的順序往前寫，是並不會錯的。而且還會給讀者以系統的概念。但是作者應當在執筆之時，把自己的年齡弄淸楚才好。如作者「在上海」（頁一三零）旣是有『十七歲孩子……』的自白，此後就不當再有『在我這剛滿十五歲的小孩子……』的話。這在作者或是用「剛滿」二字等於「十七」，但在讀者很容易誤會人的年齡是越長越小的。其實不怨讀者好生誤會，通統是由於作者在叙述上有了不自覺的矛盾。</p>
<p>四·補述方法運用的不當：在寫自述的文章內，有一種事情不値得正言，而又非加以解釋不能使讀者明瞭時，是可以在括號內補述的。但補述耍得其當，要使人明白，如「九年的家鄉敎育」中叙述：『四叔的學堂裏只有兩個學生，一個是我，一個是四叔的兒子嗣秫，比我大幾歲。嗣秫承繼瑜孀。』（頁四一）這一叚，本已說的够多的了；而又不憚煩的說：『星五伯公的二子，珍伯瑜叔皆無子，我家三哥承繼瑜伯，秫哥承繼瑜孀。』這豈不是枝外生節，故意的找廢話？又如『我父親死時，我母親只有二十三歲。我父親娶馮氏，結婚不久便遭太平天國之亂，同治二年（一八六三）死在兵亂裏。』（頁三二）乍看起，以為上一叚文中的「馬氏一，以乎就是也的親生母－馮順弟，及至我們讀到『到光緒十五年（一八八九）他在江蘇候補，生活稍安定，他才續娶我的母親』時，才證出所謂馬氏並非馮順弟，而是他父親前一個老婆了。像這里，旣是同姓馮，是很該加補述的，然而作者却又不加了。</p>
<p>五。誇大的氣勢過盛：作自述是赤裸裸的來寫自已過去的實生活。固然不需要自已隱善揚惡，作虛偽的「懺悔錄」，同時也不必把自己的一切表現的過於誇張。如作者在少年時讀了一部『資治通鑒』，編了一首『歷代帝王年號歌訣』（頁七四）就自以為是『整理國故的破土工作』。在『競業旬刋』上登了一篇白話文，就自許為對「國語」『提倡最早的了』，那都未免把自已捧的太高！</p>
<p>總之，胡適這一叚自述，在某方面說是有了相當的成功，它可以供給後世作「胡適年譄」的許多好材料。若是眞正站在文學的立塲上說，他算是大大的失敗。因爲他的自述，只是「傳記」，並不是傳記的文學」。我以為現在中國文壇上，尙不像胡適所說的那樣需要傳記文學，卽令需要，也是以自已作單位而來反映整社會和全部人生的作品，如胡適這種純粹以表揚自已為能事的『四十自述』根本是不必要的。</p>
<h3>民族自覺運動</h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>吳其昌先生在大公報本月十二日的星期論文欄發表了一篇國民節操運動。他以為只要中國人有節操，守土的就會守土，常漢奸的就會不當漢奸，所以國民節操運動就是精神的國防運動。</p>
<p>這種主張自然有道理。當帝國主義加緊侵略之時，被壓迫民族中從事文化工作的人是應該要做精神的自衛運動的。不然，入心一死，便發生民族的自殺，就）點辦法也沒有了。</p>
<p>但是怎樣建設國民的節操呢？這一點，我與吳先生大不同而且立於相反的地位。因為他的方法——在敎科書中加上節操的課，把先聖先賢「守節」「殉節」的遺訓拿來講，完全是落後的，復古的方法，沒有作用。</p>
<p>民族中之所以有人做「賣國」「叛國」的，從觀念上說來，就是由於他沒有民族自覺。這是非常明顯的事情。那末國民節操的養成不在於民族自覺的喚起麼？</p>
<p>抽象的節操遺訓是沒有作用的。而且藉重於先聖先賢的節操遺訓，乃是製造封建人格。這種封建人格完全不適用於今日。反之，倒於國民節操有妨害。鄭孝胥不是因為先聖先賢的節操遺訓而甘心做民族的叛徒嗎？</p>
<p>蘇武的漢節和文天祥的殺身，自然舍得有民族意義。然而他們之所以那樣，乃在於忠君思想和成仁思想。這就是說，他們的節操是具體的封建思想的結果，並不曾為節操而節操。那末國民節操運動便應該是民族自覺運動了。</p>
<p>想方法不從適應時代上着眼而惟知拜倒古人，其結果除了為復古運動張目外，絕不能於現實有絲毫補益。其想方法不從推動進化上着眼而惟知開倒車，那是必無效果，一定要為文化高過我們的人所征服的。中國文化之不能抵抗侵略，難道還不是八九十年來就已表明了的麽？</p>
<p>時至今日連民族自覺之為常前需要一點都不明瞭，未免可惜！中國現在的精神『國防』，是以反對帝國主義為內容的民族自覺。這就是說，中國民族應該認識他自已——他是吾為世界上的一個民族，現今處在甚麽環境中，他與帝國主義有何矛盾，要怎樣纔能從壓迫之中解放出來。</p>
<p>智識不僅是道德，同樣也是權能。所以只耍中國民族認識了他自已，那中國就不只有消極的守節份子殉節份子，而且有積極的革命份子優秀份子把民族解放的大工作完成。</p>
<p>然而不澈底排除封建思想和戀舊心情使我們的意識近代化與科學化，是不能成功的。因此民族自覺運動要繼承「五四」的精神，吾定先聖先賢，盡量吸收西洋的進步思想——立足於反個人主義之基礎上的社會本位論及其哲學。</p>
<p>只有這樣纔能使我們的民族自覺運動與近代文化及科學知識相連，而且只有這樣我們纔能抵抗開化的或新式的野蠻（帝國主義）的侵略。</p>
<p>撑出民族自覺運動的大旗，對帝國主義吧！</p>
<h3>介紹一部中國文學工具書</h3>
<p>— 鍾怡</p>
<p>—中國文學年表—</p>
<p>在此地，我不願意多講關於文學其他方面的廢話：可是，最低限度，我却不能不提出幾個問題來，在此地討論：</p>
<p>第一，無工具書而研究文學的困難</p>
<p>第二，文學工具書的重要。</p>
<p>第三，近來一班文學工具書概觀。</p>
<p>文學非專為欣賞的，這雖然被「為藝術而藝術」的朋友們所反對；然而，文學畢竟是離開不了時代而能存在的。換句話講，文學的產生，絕對是各有各的背景的。因為這個原故，所以一個作家的生率年代，時代背景，以及一篇作品的產生時代，和作家的環境；都十分需要研究得淸淸楚楚，然後對於這作家，這作品，才能認識，才能研究，才能算是明白。</p>
<p>可是一談到作家身世和時代背景，至少說，就會發生「時」和「地」的問題。這一個作家，究竟是生在那一年？死在那一年？他是那裏人？他做某一篇文學作品的地點和時間，又在何處？何年？當然，我們研究文學，不是專門考究這些死的考據的：然而為了求文學本身的了解，却不能不先從這些地方着手。因此，許多研究文學的人，常常會捨本而務末，專忙副目的而忘却本身。這是為什麽？這就是文學工具書的缺乏。</p>
<p>所以文學工具書，明白的說，是研究文學的工具。他可以多方面幫着你讀書，他可以多方面幫着你研究。在時間方面，你可以省却許多那翻書借書檢查抄錄的功夫；在精神方面，你又可以省却許多那考證人名地名年代的腦力。所以文學工具書，實在是十分的重要。</p>
<p>中國文學的工具書，在淸朝以前很是少見；到了淸朝，才漸漸地多起來。近來因為科學方法的進步，整理的人才輩出，所以更是發達。其中重要的，有：</p>
<p>羣經檢目</p>
<p>十三經索引</p>
<p>史姓韻編</p>
<p>中國大事年表</p>
<p>歷代名人年譜</p>
<p>歷代名人生率年表</p>
<p>歷代地理沿革表</p>

<h3>言論自由果有切實的保障了嗎？</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>言論自由，已爲今日國人一致的要求。國府有鍳及此，近曾通令全國，切實保障正當言論，以崇法治，而重民意。這現象是極可喜的。然而言論自由，就果有切實的保障了嗎？依近頃的言論方面，加以觀察，言論確已解放不少。我們方幸久陷沉悶的言論界，今後將漸有恢復自由的希望。不意國府保障言論的命令，頒發未久，無錫却發生一件當局壓迫言論的事，這是如何的不幸！據去年十二月二十九日報載無錫訊：無錫各報，奉警備部命，禁止登載學生請願運動新聞，各報卽於當晚召集全體緊急會議，因無錫各報，近日所載新聞，學運佔多，一旦禁止登載，勢必大半空白，為接受警備部命令起見，二十八日各報一律停刋一天，並發聲明，以告各界。</p>
<p>保障言論自由，最低限度，正確的言論與眞實的消息，應讓其自由發揮，官方不加干涉。蓋言論自由，本為國法所允許，也為人民應有的權利。當局邇來對言論取監視的態度，原屬特殊環境下，一種不得已的辦法。但現在政府旣有保障言論自由的通令，地方當局，自宜遵守奉行。乃無錫這决竟有禁止各報，登載學生請願運動之舉，殊為遺憾。學生運動，為人民愛國思想的表示。登載學生運動的新聞，事甚正當，並不違法，何必加以干涉呢？豈當局認學生的愛國行動，為有所妨害，故不准報紙刋載嗎？</p>
<p>本來，保障言論自由，不是一紙空命令，所能見效的，非有切實的辦法，言論便得不到保障。依我們的主張，當局果有誠意恢複言論自由，首先應改變新聞政策。而改變新聞政策的第一步，就應取消新聞檢查制度。但這在事實上，一時恐怕還做不到。不得已而求其决，便應實行中央日報所要求，黨部或政府主管新聞的機關，與言論界商量一個簡明的方法，明確的規定幾條嚴格的限制外，凡各種正確的言論與眞實的消息，應一律准許本國報紙登載。要是連這一點也辦不到，那政府所發布切實保障正當言論的通令，只不過是一紙空支票而已，言論自由，永是無從保降的。</p>
<p>言論為救國的重要工具，國民的言論不能自由，便無異减少了救國的力量。人民對國事有意見不能發表，國事人民也不能知道，試問在這種狀態之下，政府要呌人民共赴國難，這是可能的嗎？</p>
<h3>失業的人</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>十一月。</p>
<p>江南的十一月沒有溫情，沒有暖意；有的是冷的，沒同情的，初冬的寒風</p>
<p>左手染了風腫症的唐熙，這幾天更是憔悴了。</p>
<p>記得那時候正是夏天，找不到活兒的他又想起上海來啦。他對於上海是並不陌生的。一九三二因戰後失業而離開上海，一九三三流浪到香港，一九三四和一九三五的上半年在廣州，那兩個地方都是南國有名的大都會，在那裏，他過若拿自家兒的氣力而交換得來的生活。可是，當失業之魔風也似的追隨到他的身上，他終於又被撲倒。他老想爬起來，一决，兩决，……歸根還是爬不起身，只好躺在那魔鬼的脚下喘着氣。</p>
<p>漸漸地，日子對於他也變成無聊而悠長的了，為了納悶，他就時常在街上</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>蹓躂着。</p>
<p>在這一大串的浪蕩的日子裏邊，有一天，當他剛踏進鴻興茶樓的時候，遇見了那久別的歐建德。——那脚色是被人稱為牛欄小諸葛的，有一點小智慧，善處理小事件，但有時也會失敗，失敗和成功的比例大約是八與二之比。</p>
<p>那天，他們兩個兒把大半天的時光安放在談話上面。</p>
<p>談到職業問題，唐熙就用着最誠懇的態度來向他求敎了。這番，小諸葛沒有給他「如此如此」的錦囊妙計，只正色地對他說：</p>
<p>「大佬」人生出來不是為挨餓的嗄。有路走路，這條走不通就走別一條。你還記得趙松臣那傢伙麽？　說景近他榮任了一個什麽輪船公司的船務主任。旣然當初在你從上海到這裏的時候，他能週濟你那麽的一筆旅費，我想，現在去求求他，恐怕不見得會「拒你」於「門外」吧。」</p>
<p>並且，他還給他解决了水脚的問題</p>
<p>「到上海去的大艙（卽統艙）的水脚，是不需要怎樣大的一注錢的。倘使你眞的要去的話，你可以向廣肇公所的肥佬鄭想想法子。」</p>
<p>臨別的時候，他又說：</p>
<p>「事在人為。沒有事候人；只有人找事。去吧！大佬。」</p>
<p>唐熙對於小諸葛之代他所籌謀的計劃，威激得幾乎流出淚水了。　　當晚　耐着氣，在肥佬鄭的聲色俱厲的責罵與敎訓之下，終於　到了八隻雪白的銀元。</p>
<p>肥佬鄭的脾氣雖然凶，但心腸總是義氣的呢。</p>
<p>第二晚。——</p>
<p>沒有一個送行的人。</p>
<p>行李也是簡單的。只有一條毛毯和一張薄得可憐的小棉被，以及一些從雜貨塲裏檢出來一樣的日常用品。</p>
<p>他就縮做一團的躱在角落裏，讓那隻太古仔「廣生」把他載到上海去。</p>
<p>四日的旅程後，他，探險者尋覓到了富源似的，在那海輸上投了一個最後的瞥視，便踏上了目的地。</p>
<p>第一件事，就是找個棲宿的住所，這不用想，又是光臨「樂易軒」了。　　住在那裏的人　對於平空多添了的這一個新客，是永遠不會處到　罕的　（這會社，每每為一些貧窮的流浪的人們，因了同鄕的面子而住下來的。）只有幾個在那裏邊資格頂老的刻薄鬼，用懷疑的眼光去瞧他，同時，也懷疑地想着。</p>
<p>「久違了，你這傻傢伙。空手地去流浪了三幾年，而今，又空手地來了麼？」</p>
<p>唐熙逢人便探詢趙松臣的消息。回答他的人，有的搖搖頭；有的唏噓着：有的先來一個深長的太息，但，歸根那句「老趙也不比從前了」的話，是常被掛在嘴邊的。</p>
<p>好容易問到趙松臣的住址。　　可是，兩　　見可　又不給見。　　　　主次，那　　的　他纏得太　　了，便敎第二天去。</p>
<p>第二天，在趙松臣的一陣婉辭的推却和施與了一點小恩惠之後，他依舊是陷在失業的泥潭裏。</p>
<p>這幾天，身子挨不住塞冷，左手又因受了風而腫起來了。</p>
<p>他可不能灰心，他每天每天不斷地想去克服倒霉的魔鬼。但，……</p>
<h3>女神</h3>
<p>「殺！殺！殺！」敵人的呼聲像海裏的怒濤，共工跳起身來向四面望了一望，一面是海，兩面岩壁，已是無路可逃，他便大呌一聲「黨徒們起來！」準備作困獸之鬥。（十八）</p>
<h3>歲暮</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>太陽從東河灘的水平綫下探起了半個臉來，從朦朧的晨霧裏，透過了樹梢，山峯，和許多灰頹的屋頂。</p>
<p>風，三天來沒有吹過，所以這小小的龔家堡也只在平靜和沉寂裏躺着；但氣候很嚴寒，近處的池潭裏全已結着厚厚的氷。屋裏的老母鷄嘓嘓嘓地蹲在柴堆邊不敢走出門去，門外的那條瘦黑狗却躲在牆角裏太陽下瑟瑟地顫抖，懶得起來走動；曠塲上是靜靜地不見一個人影，靑松技上的濃霜給陽光耀得一閃一閃地發亮。</p>
<p>欄裏的那隻過年猪，也許昨天晚上沒有吃得飽，或者在憂愁着自已流血的日子已到，嗬嗬嗬地呌着。</p>
<p>五叔無力地提着一支旱烟管，走出了大門，站在照牆邊，隔着老梅樹望到那一片白迷迷的湖面上，也是靜悄悄地，連一條帆船都沒有。</p>
<p>他將那支旱烟管送進了已經脫掉了門牙的　嘴唇裏，吧阿吧的吸了幾口，遊縷似的白烟在他面前消失，接着，又會一縷一縷地跟踵了起來。在往日，五叔每天淸晨也總是照例地提着旱烟管到門外曠塲上去晒太陽的，而且每遇鄰人向他打招呼時，他也用着他慣常的笑臉去回報人家：「呵！今天的太陽好得來」！可是今天，他的心頭已給一團悲苦壓住着。</p>
<p>旱烟管裏已經沒有了烟火，他呼了幾口，只是吱吱吱的怪呌。他將烟筒頭嗒嗒地在泥地上敲了幾下，拍去了餘燼。用那隻枯瘦的手在灰白的鬍鬚上捋了捋，揩去了凝滯在嘴邊的淸水鼻涕，咳着嗽。一種衰老的心境顫戰着，使得他威覺到人老年殘的悲哀！</p>
<p>他拖着沉重的脚步，茫然地走到垃圾潭邊的一塊黃石上坐了下來，望着矮垣邊的那叢淡竹葉給風吹得儘在搖頭幌腦。他想起現在又是年夜快了；在前幾年，這時人家都忙着過年了：掃塵，打糕，殺猪，可是現在村子裏還是靜悄悄地，一點也找不出年夜的景象，只在每一個鄭人的臉上將陰黯更　得　厚了點　同　那憂愁的負　也隨着過去的　子在人們的心裏加重——</p>
<p>「阿五，我連這一决已跑了三趟了，你這點眞是貼我的脚步錢還不够的，，今天三明天四的的人家，人家也等着要開銷的啊！」說着便是砰的一下桌子：「老實說，今年大年夜是决不會放你過門的了，你逃得和尙逃不得寺，大年夜沒有錢，我東西也耍搬的……」昨天白眼和尙那副猙獰的面目，突然又在五叔腦膜上重現了。</p>
<p>他想：我欠的債不單是白眼和尙的；還有糧錢，欠一個月就得加一角利息，而且到年底不繳淸，便須將地產充公。雖然自已欄裏還有一頭猪，然而猪身錢早已在殺猪德福那裏借來吃了飯，已經算不得自家的了。現在離大年夜祗有幾天，到那裏去想法這三十多塊錢來還債呢？當當吧，家裏又沒有什麼値錢的束西，押賈地產，在這年三夜四有誰要？况且大家都一樣地在述飯也沒有吃………他想到這些不禁悚然了，吃力地抬起了那沉重而昏矇的腦袋，向前凝視，債主們的臉，却都在朝着他慘笑，有時，他還會聽到那一串「嘿！嘿！嘿！」的聲音。</p>
<p>可怕的幻影；他闔上了眼皮，沒有勇氣看，也沒有勇氣想了。</p>
<p>「爹，吃粥啦！」直到他的媳婦來呌他吃蕃薯粥，纔把他從恐懼和痛苦中喚醒了過來。</p>
<h3>在北荒</h3>
<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>綿亘在額爾沽納河東岸的一帶峯巒起伏的灰濛濛的由野中，那被凄冷的，十月的北荒寒風吹拂着的森林，灌木業，野草，憔悴的，已失去溫馨的馥郁的氣息，與蓬勃綠油油的光彩。山野是憂鬱了。</p>
<p>死靜的大地，正被寒冷的季候支配者。偶而落着飛揚的雪片，在巍峨的山尖上，在狹小的原野上，在廣火的森林上，在旅人底艱險的路上。</p>
<p>山，重重聲疊，那麽高，那麽長，又是那麼灣曲：一條由石塊沙土，草根，形成的崎嶇的，羊腸似的由路，緊緊地　峻峭的山壁與繁密的樹林握繞着，　　些　　邊不　　來的樣子，　　　地窒息地開展着。總是遇着一個放晴的天氣，任漫空閒蕩着無慮的輕薄的白色雲絲，然而，太陽的光芒並不肯賜給旅人一個恬靜可喜的笑臉，只是遙遙地炫照着森林以外的地帶。於是，旅人底路途變作黑夜里的一條睡死的無燈光照耀的街巷，變作地下層的一條開鑿的深黑難走的溝渠了。</p>
<p>然，每天每天就在這樣的路途上跋踄着。但我並不倦於流浪的艱苦。我底長長的淸癯的臉子上，不時的爬動着一縷孤獨的微笑呵。</p>
<p>疲倦了，我底蒼老的心情，往往要回復到童年時期的天眞境界里：哼着被遺忘的歌調。我慣會憇息於路旁的枯草之上，瞅着前面那未經踏完的，朦朧的幻想着。一回兒，我望望頭頂上壓着的錯亂的樹枝，天被遮擋着遼遠了，只是露出一片糢糊的靑色的輸廓來。於是我便抬起腦袋來，睜大了眼珠子，裂開了鬆弛的嘴皮，悒鬰地，用手去指點着那橫躺在我面前的一串聳然的山巓，數着：一個，兩個，三個……畢竟是孩子氣呵，覺得毫無趣味，便傻氣的愚蠢的笑了。餓了，我可就把腦袋縮在滿是油膩的大衣領子里，在行李捲里掏出一片乾硬的用包米麵子做成的長圓形的扁餅子，蠻里蠻氣地大口吞嚥着，沒有幾分鐘的工夫，我底空虛的肚子被裝滿了。我感覺我底筋肉開始活跳着，却充滿了偉大的生存的火力。我忘記這是十月的寒冷的季節。我更忘記山風時時在同我週身襲擊。我蠻不經意的把一頂黑色的長毛的狗皮帽子從頭上脫下來，兩隻鷹爪似的手，猛力地抓着怪癢癢而好久沒有剪理的披散在　頸上的長髪。我皺起眉頭。我用牙齒咬着灰白的下唇。我不知道我是在幹什麽。我彷彿是在做夢。</p>
<p>當我被那不可捉摸的悠遠的迷夢纏醒時，我底耳朵已聽着隔山的一種急噪的，宏大的機器的抹擦聲響起來。山野給震蕩得開始不安了。我霍地立起身來，把放在脚底下的小行李捲提在肩膀上便怱忽慌慌地，猶如一頭被追逐的小鹿，滿跚地直衝上峭陡山尖，立刻，太陽底影子在我底頭頂上閃耀了；我底視錢也請朗地拉長了遠的山，遠的樹，遠的原野，遠的村落……大野山正套着開往西伯利亞的一列火車，冒着濃墨色的黑烟，，繚繞着，疾馳地遠去了。</p>
<p>惘惘地，我底心威到了凄顫，空虛。</p>

<h3>電影明星王人美離婚</h3>
<p>電影明星王人美，自與所愛實行同居後，卿卿我我，恩愛逾常，詎所愛因欲發展事業，苦無資本，遂商之於舊同學某君，某有寡人癖，千金買笑，毫無吝色，王之所天欲與某謀一面或細譚，非在其香巢不可，初固不願，積久亦安之，惟絕對不作非分想也；花業中見其忠厚可欺，咸與之戲，尤以名花小林黛玉最為惡作劇。前晚王之所天，訪某於小林黛玉處，旣入，某尚未至，小林黛玉見其呆坐沙發之，旣入，某尙未至，小林黛玉見其呆坐沙發之上，乘其不意，偷而吻之，復頻頻呼「麥大令」，更乘勢坐於其膝，王之所天無法逃避，惟有掉其首，移視線於他處，轉面適對門口，適人美含笑立於門外，見所天轉面，即返身奔去。王之所天大駭，急推小林黛玉於地，追之至於樓下，適値其友某自外入，又相偕登樓，是晚小林黛玉等故意將王之所天灌醉，迨歸家，天將破曉，王人美尚未睡，王欲加以責問，詎所天竟指美爲小林黛玉，大呼林妹妹不止，人美至此忍無可忍，遂怒　之，聞人美與所天，因此事離異之說。又有一說，人美已於發表所天秘密之次晨即出走。究竟如何，須持新華公司史東山導演之長恨歌公映後，始得明白，蓋上述即長恨歌之片段劇情，所說人美所天，亦係劇中人，非電影皇帝金燄云。</p>
<h3>胡蝶新婚後新作「刦後桃花」</h3>
<p>明日公映兩佳片</p>
<h3>「玉慘花愁」及「洗冤錄」</h3>
<p>自「蝴蝶夫人」一片問世後，雪爾組薛耐的大名，幾乎無人不曉，現在，薜耐女士，又以悲感的情調，在「玉慘花愁」Mary　Burns　Fugitive一片裹，和影迷相見了。一個孤苦伶仃的女子，警探在搜捕她，匪類在脅誘她，男性在爭佔她，東竄西匿，朝不保夕，精神上和肉體上的痛苦，可說是到了極點，薛耐女士在本片表演的精細，更是高人一等，這片子已定於明天（星期五）起，在大光明公映了。</p>
<p>國泰大戲院明天開映的「洗寃錄」Steamboat　Round　The　Bedn，也是一部極得欣賞的片子。惠爾羅吉士，在美國素有幽默大師的稱號，他所主演的影片，到處受人歡迎，賣座之盛，常在一般女大明星主演的片子以上，自從他在飛機上喪命後，影迷莫不同聲浩歎，在電影界中，的確是一個極大的損失。這部「洗寃錄」，是他最後一决的遺作，用最幽默的方式，演極緊張的故事，希望愛好羅吉士藝術的影迷，不要錯過。</p>
<h3>「花花草草」底演出人</h3>
<p>「花花草草」為天一公司卽將開拍之有聲新片，人選問題，業經决定：據導演高梨痕言，女角色方面有新人張一，胖大姐吳茵。男角色方面，除了天一基本演員張振鐸，沈亞偷，蕭正中之外，還有舞台新人冷波，和新人姚萍等，假若沒有意外，這整齊的陣綫，是不會有什麼變動的。</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Assumes Chairmanship of Hebei Province; Wan Fulin Presides Over Oath-Taking as Song Declares Two Major Policies</h3>
<p>Gives Address to City's Populace Gathered at South Parade Ground; Governor Song Returns to Beiping After First Meeting Today</p>
<p>Beiping, Baoding Telephone Dispatch: The new Chairman of Hebei Province, Song Zheyuan, received and addressed personnel from the Provincial Government Secretariat at 9:00 AM this morning. At 10:00 AM, representatives from all sectors hosted a public banquet for Song in the Provincial Government Auditorium. At 11:00 AM, Song, accompanied by all members of the Provincial Government, was sworn into office, with Wan Fulin presiding over the oath-taking. Over 500 guests were in attendance. Wan delivered a speech, hoping that all committee members would diligently fulfill their duties. Song responded, stating that after assuming office, his future work would focus on eradicating bandits, stabilizing finances, and engaging with the people honestly, striving to maintain public order.

Song expressed deep regret for not being able to stay in Baoding for long due to pressing matters in Beiping. He outlined two major policies: first, to avoid internal conflict, and second, to eliminate the communist bandits. Regarding his military administration, Song emphasized the eight virtues of filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. He stressed that the military must be integrated with the people. Song scheduled a banquet for all sectors at 5:30 PM this afternoon and a first decision-making meeting of the Provincial Government at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning, followed by a return to Beiping by special train at 8:00 AM.

In the future, he will pay attention to local security and the eradication of bandits. Liu Guitang's bandit troops crossed into Laiyuan yesterday and are being vigorously suppressed, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. The Hebei Eastern issue will not be difficult to resolve, but the Chahar North issue is quite complicated and is currently under negotiation. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Gunfire at Chaoyangmen in Ping; Japanese Side Shifts Blame to Us</h3>
<p>Truth Has Been Ascertained; Negotiations Have Not Yielded Results</p>
<p>Beiping: On the evening of the 5th, a Japanese soldier riding in a car came from Tongxian to Chaoyangmen. Because it was late and the city gates were closed, the soldiers of the 29th Army guarding the city asked their superiors inside the city whether they could open the gates. A conflict ensued, and shots were exchanged, but fortunately, no one was injured. On the morning of the 6th, the Garrison Command and the Japanese Garrison sent personnel to investigate. The Japanese side shifted the blame to our side. In the afternoon, Commander Hasegawa visited Song Zheyuan to negotiate. Song, being busy, instructed him to visit Mayor Qin instead. There has been no result yet. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Reports about the gunfire incident at Chaoyangmen on Sunday contradict each other, causing unease among the people of Beiping. It is said that the Japanese military authorities are very angry about this matter. According to the Japanese side, Chinese soldiers opened fire without provocation, shooting at a car occupied by one Japanese officer and five Japanese soldiers. Rumor has it that the Japanese side will continue to make demands. The Japanese side said that Commander Tada of the Japanese Garrison will handle the matter with Song Zheyuan when Song returns to Beiping from Baoding. According to reports from the Chinese side, the blame for the incident lies with the Japanese. Chaoyangmen closes every night at 9:30 PM, and cannot be opened without the permission of a local official. At 10:25 PM on Sunday night, a Japanese officer, accompanied by several Japanese soldiers, arrived at Chaoyangmen. The police guarding the city immediately telephoned the headquarters for instructions and received a reply. The city gate was then opened. At that point, the Japanese officer argued with the police because the city gate was not opened immediately. An officer commanding thirty to forty Chinese soldiers stationed on the city tower came downstairs to mediate. Unexpectedly, the Japanese officer tried to take the pistol from his waist. The Chinese officer, fearing that the weapon would be seized, ran back upstairs. The Japanese officer then drew his own pistol and opened fire, and the Chinese soldiers also opened fire in response. However, both sides fired into the air, and the bullets landed far away. After the Japanese officer arrived at the Japanese Embassy, the commander of the embassy guard immediately sent a small squad of soldiers to search the city tower. According to the Japanese side, they had found bullets fired by the Chinese soldiers. The Chinese soldiers had picked up bullets fired by the Japanese soldiers in the street. The Japanese side claimed that the Japanese soldiers did not fire any shots, but the Chinese side insisted that the Japanese soldiers fired first. The Chinese side hopes that the matter can be resolved after Song Zheyuan returns. However, with a series of incidents occurring one after another, there are fears that this will lead to a major negotiation and serious consequences. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: After the gunfire occurred outside Chaoyangmen on the 5th, publication was prohibited at the time because the truth was not yet clear. The facts are now being inquired from all parties, and they are as follows. On the night of January 5th, at just after 10:00 PM, Japanese soldiers called at the gate of Chaoyangmen. Police officer Zhang Yuting and squad leader Zhang Juting of the Second Security Team, who were stationed there, did not dare to open the gate without authorization because the city was already closed and the Japanese soldiers did not have passes. They telephoned the relevant official in charge of the area for instructions and then went to open the gate. Five Japanese military policemen entered the city at that time. They were very dissatisfied because the gate was opened slightly late, so they grabbed and beat squad leader Zhang Juting and police officer Zhang Yuting. Zhang Juting was injured in the lip and was bleeding, and his leg was also kicked. He fled to outside the city gate. The Japanese soldiers then entered the military police station to investigate. Xie Dongqi, the platoon leader of the 29th Army stationed in the city, happened to be there. The Japanese soldiers questioned him, their anger unabated. They grabbed Xie with one hand and reached into their clothes as if to draw a pistol. Xie struggled to escape and hid on the city wall. The Japanese soldiers chased after him and fired three shots. The soldiers guarding the city, seeing someone on the city wall firing shots, also fired shots into the sky to warn and defend themselves. The Japanese soldiers then left in car number 30. After hearing the report, the Garrison Command immediately dispatched Counselor Niu Xianzheng, together with Fan Mingsheng, an official from the First District Office, and eight or nine Japanese military policemen, including Inogami and Anmoto, to investigate the situation at the time. Squad leader Zhang Juting stated the facts and showed his injuries. The Japanese military policemen understood and left a business card, asking Counselor Niu for two shell casings from the time to take away. At 2:00 AM, the district received a call from the Japanese military barracks, saying that they would send Deputy Officer Kono and others to reinvestigate with Counselor Niu. Upon arriving at the scene, Kono demanded to go up the city wall to inspect it, but the soldiers guarding the city refused. Kono then asked Zhang Juting who had beaten him and ordered him to identify them. Zhang, because there were many Japanese soldiers at the time and it was dark, could not see clearly and was reluctant to point them out casually. Kono then stated that since Zhang could not identify who had beaten him, even if there were injuries, they could not be used as evidence and strongly demanded that he issue a written statement proving that he had not been beaten. Zhang, seeing the seriousness of the situation at the time and realizing that it could not be resolved otherwise, had to issue a certificate, which Niu wrote on his behalf and gave to Kono. Then everyone dispersed. This is the actual situation that night. It is now heard that the authorities are negotiating with the Japanese side about this matter. The main points of the negotiation are: 1. Squad leader Zhang Juting was indeed beaten by Japanese soldiers and has been examined at the hospital. There is evidence of injury, and there is a doctor's certificate to prove it. (The certificate of no injury issued by Squad Leader Zhang was written under duress.) 2. The pistol bullet casings. The squad leaders and police officers stationed in the city were unarmed, and Platoon Leader Xie was also not carrying a gun. The soldiers on the city wall were carrying rifles. Therefore, the source of the pistol bullet casings is now clear, which serves as evidence. (The above two points are based on actual evidence, and it is believed that the matter can be resolved through legitimate channels soon and will not escalate.) (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: Xu Mo stated that he should bear full responsibility for the error in the higher education entrance examination questions. At the time, I drafted many questions, but because my original duties were heavy and time was very pressing, there was an error of one word in the International Law examination question for judicial officials. Fortunately, the answers of the examinees were not affected by this, but because it concerns the examination administration, the fault of negligence is indeed difficult to excuse. I am deeply apprehensive that Chairman Niu has taken the blame on my behalf and have already apologized to Dai and Niu and made appropriate expressions. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: Kong Xiangxi stated that after the implementation of the new monetary policy, strict prohibitions had been imposed on the use of silver and the concealment and deliberate evasion with the intention of profiting on the high-price purchase and sale of silver.

<h3>Prerequisites for Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>The talk of China and Japan using a conference as a starting point to adjust their relations has, according to observations from domestic and foreign telegrams over the past ten days, seemed to have a tendency to become a reality. During the progression of this trend, every time a Chinese person's eyes come into contact with this news, two questions inevitably arise in their mind: (1) Under the current state of Sino-Japanese relations, is it actually possible to restore the normal state of diplomacy and establish a Sino-Japanese conference on an equal footing based on genuine non-threat and non-aggression? (2) If this conference can truly be established and yield results, what will be the advantages and disadvantages for China? This reporter, with limited intelligence, dares to assert, in light of the various events that have occurred since this time last year in the so-called Hirota's New China Policy and Economic Cooperation Movement, that in order to truly adjust Sino-Japanese relations and resolve the Sino-Japanese problem, the prerequisites must first be clarified before there is any hope.</p>
<p>In Ambassador Arima's "New Year's Reflections" on the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations, he said, "...The fundamental problem is that both countries' officials and people must truly recognize the interdependent relationship of mutual assistance and support between the two countries in order to enhance the welfare of both countries and maintain peace in East Asia. If one does not start from this understanding, no matter what adjustment methods are used, the result will only be a temporary solution." Although this reporter is accustomed to hearing such rhetoric from Japanese diplomats, I believe that in the midst of widespread news of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, his words are of great value. If the people of our country can understand the true meaning behind his diplomatic rhetoric, then the Japanese side's attitude can be seen to be mutually consistent with Foreign Minister Hirota's Three Principles towards China last November. What the Chinese people want to ask is, what should the behavior under this understanding and principle be?</p>
<p>The majority of Chinese people believe that there are obstacles to adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. Let us examine the facts. When Foreign Minister Hirota announced his new diplomatic policy towards China in mid-January last year, advocating non-threat, non-aggression, and genuinely enabling China to stand on an equal footing with independence and autonomy, the Chinese authorities responded positively and prepared to take action. When economic cooperation was advocated, the Chinese people also painfully agreed and prepared to cooperate. However, amidst the changing atmosphere, the North China problem at the end of May and the so-called autonomy activities in November followed one after another. The facts are clear and those in charge are present. If such contradictory events occur frequently as a national policy, proceeding on both sides as a way to thoroughly resolve China, then the problem lies elsewhere. Otherwise, the people who obstruct Sino-Japanese relations can be summoned and named. What is the benefit of Chinese officials and civilians recognizing the meaning of assistance and interdependence?</p>
<p>In summary, adjusting Sino-Japanese relations through diplomatic means is, in principle, undoubtedly the right path. If it is fortunate enough to succeed, then China's restoration of old ties with its neighbor under the conditions of territorial integrity and sovereign independence would also be a rare achievement. However, what everyone is focused on is that those with real power on the other side seem to want to use China's fate as a tool to establish their achievements, and their diplomatic authorities have also failed to maintain unique insights to maintain national relations. If one wishes to adjust relations under these circumstances, unless the neighboring country first realizes this, establishes a genuine good-neighborly national policy, and curbs the activities of ambitious people, then it is difficult to speak of a bright future.</p>

<h3>Economic Industry Discussions</h3>
<p>— Edited by Tang Qingzeng</p>
<p>Living Standards and Living Expenses (Continued) Zhao Ren</p>
<p>If living standards remain unchanged, fluctuations in living expenses are due to fluctuations in the prices of various items within the standard. If living standards also change, the fluctuations in living expenses become more complex. If standards are reduced while prices rise, living expenses may rise or remain the same. If standards rise while prices fall, expenses may fall or not fall. If standards are reduced and prices also fall, expenses will definitely decrease. If standards rise and prices also rise, expenses will greatly increase. Therefore, those studying living expenses must specify a certain living standard, assuming it remains constant, and observe the level of living expenses based on the rise and fall of prices at different times and places. German statistician Ernst Engel analyzed the income and expenditure of European working-class families in 1857. He first divided the items included in the living standard into five major categories: food, clothing, housing, heating and lighting, and miscellaneous items. Miscellaneous items included education, religion, tuition, health insurance, sports, and entertainment. He then analyzed the distribution of household expenses based on the amount of their income. There were four main conclusions: First, the more income, the smaller the percentage of expenditure on food. Second, the more income, there is no significant increase or decrease in the percentage of expenditure on clothing. Third, regardless of income level, the percentage of expenses for rent, heating, and lighting remains constant. Fourth, the more income, the larger the percentage of total living expenses spent on miscellaneous items such as education, health, and entertainment. Following Engel, sociologists and statisticians from various countries have conducted hundreds of such investigations. Sweden even conducts nationwide household living expense surveys on a regular basis by law. In Shanghai, China, the report of the National Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance (formerly the Price Investigation Office in Shanghai) was the first large-scale study on the living expenses of workers, followed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. Their conclusions regarding food and miscellaneous items were completely consistent with Engel's first and fourth points. Clothing expenses showed a significant increase in percentage with the increase in income. The percentage of total living expenses accounted for by rent, heating, and lighting showed a decrease with the increase in income. This kind of research can not only indicate the living conditions and affluence of workers, but also indicate the impact of price changes and the weight of taxes on the material life of workers. If we can study the living standards and expenses of various occupational groups, the dynamics of the national economy can be clearly understood. However, in any country, most of these surveys are still limited to workers, because the survey work is easier, the cost is lower, and workers also occupy the most important position in industrial countries.</p>
<p>In addition to investigating the living conditions of workers, the National Tariff Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs also compiled a worker living expense index, which was announced monthly. This index first assumes a certain type of worker family, limits its number of people, and assumes that the quantity and quality of the items consumed remain unchanged. Several items are selected as representatives of living expenses, and their market prices are surveyed monthly. At the same time, the importance of these items in the living standard is considered, and a comprehensive average is calculated. For comparison, the prices of each month are first divided by the prices of the same items in a certain period to convert them into percentages, and then a comprehensive average is calculated. Or the comprehensive expenses of each month are divided by the comprehensive expenses of a certain period to find its percentage. This percentage represents the rise and fall of worker living expenses in each month of the year compared with a certain period. For example, the Tariff Commission used 1926 as the basic comparison period. In 1932, the cost of living was 126 percent. This assumes that the worker's living standard remains unchanged. Items that only cost 100 yuan in 1926 would cost 126 yuan in 1932. The index for each month of this year has continued to fall, from 111 percent in January to 104 percent in October. Assuming that the worker's living standard remains unchanged and income remains unchanged, living expenses have clearly decreased in these months. In other words, life should be more comfortable than before. However, the fall in living expenses is due to the fall in prices, and the fall in prices is detrimental to industry and commerce, which may require reduced working hours or factory shutdowns. Workers' income may not be unaffected. Therefore, the rise and fall of living expenses may be a blessing or a disaster for workers, which cannot be arbitrarily determined. If the cost of living falls and income increases or remains the same, workers are more comfortable than before. If the cost of living rises and income falls or remains the same, workers will definitely feel difficulties. Or the cost of living and income fall at the same time, but the former is more severe than the latter, which is good for workers. If the cost of living and income rise at the same time, but the former is more common than the latter, it is a disaster for workers. Rising living expenses indirectly lead to workers demanding increased wages. Or stipulating a minimum wage, using living expenses as a measuring tool, is the reason for this.</p>

<h3>Pessimistic Outlook for Naval Conference "Four Against One" to Deal with Japan Japan Firmly Opposes Ship Construction Notification Plan England, America, France, and Italy Said to Have Reached an Agreement</h3>
<p>London As of this afternoon, the general public is quite pessimistic about the future of the naval conference. It is widely rumored that if Japan still firmly opposes other countries' proposals, causing the naval conference to fail, and the country then greatly increases its naval armaments, then England, France, Italy, and the United States intend to conclude a four-nation agreement to deal with the situation. This agreement will contain a "step-by-step" clause (that is, if countries other than the four signatories increase their naval tonnage, then the four countries can increase their navies according to the same ratio). Naval figures here believe that the proposal to sign a four-nation agreement, with the exception of England, the other three national delegations will all express their approval. Britain is eager for the naval conference to continue working, and no price is too high. It is also generally believed that the British delegation is prepared to study any plan that can extend the conference time, such as discussing political issues. (Havas dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo It is reported that at the Disarmament Conference Committee on the afternoon of the 8th, the United States attached certain conditions and agreed to the French proposal. England, America, France, and Italy will deal with Japan on a united front. However, the Japanese naval authorities have the following views on the ship construction plan declaration:</p>
<p>The United Kingdom believes that when the quantitative and qualitative restrictions fail to reach an agreement, it proposes a ship construction plan notification case, hoping to reach an agreement, and therefore agrees to the French and Italian proposals, so there is a great possibility of relying on a common battle line. However, the suggestion, as its name suggests, is only a notification of the plan and has no actual restrictions, so it seems to have a deeper meaning. It is necessary to be highly vigilant against those who adhere to such a conciliatory attitude. If it is a countermeasure against other countries' forces, it should be strictly kept secret, but if it is published in advance, no matter how famous the case is, it will lose its secrecy and effectiveness, so it is extremely detrimental to naval countries in an inferior position. The focus of the United Kingdom is here, and France also focuses on Germany, so its true intention is not to promote the spirit of disarmament, nor is its purpose to reserve a place for future disarmament conferences, so it cannot agree to the proposal. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Contents of French and Italian Proposals</h3>
<p>London The French delegation to the naval conference suggested yesterday that a naval agreement be established based on the principle of exchanging information on shipbuilding procedures among various naval countries. Italy also made a suggestion based on this principle. The naval delegations of the five countries met separately this afternoon to study the suggestions made by France and Italy. According to inquiries from this agency, the main points of the French proposal are that each naval country must notify each other of the shipbuilding process within one year in advance. If there are difficulties, they should consult with each other, but the information exchanged between countries does not have to be of a general nature and include long-term shipbuilding procedures. According to the British delegation, the French proposal also contains a possibility, that is, the shipbuilding procedures of various countries should be adapted to their construction capabilities, but it is not yet known on what basis this kind of differential treatment is based. As for the Italian proposal, it also advocates that countries notify each other of the shipbuilding process within one year, but there are no regulations on whether to continue exchanging information after one year.

<h3>Japan Alone Holds Different Views</h3>
<p>London According to British naval sources, the suggestions made by Italy and France are very similar. If there is a possibility of reaching a compromise, the United Kingdom will strive to reconcile the views of Italy and France so that they are closer to each other. The main key at present is the attitude of the United States and Japan. The United States believes that Japan should express its opinion first, and then the US delegation can express its position. On this point, the Japanese government spokesman issued a declaration this morning criticizing the French proposal. There are two points of dissent: The French proposal did not stipulate a way to reduce naval armaments, and did not actually recognize the equal rights that Japan demanded. France advocates that shipbuilding procedures should be adapted to the construction capabilities of each country, in other words, shipbuilding should be limited by budgetary capabilities, which is especially harmful to Japan. As far as naval officials know, there is one point that Japan also opposes, but it is inconvenient to formally propose, that is, once the French proposal is implemented, Japan's powerful secret military equipment will inevitably have nowhere to hide. If so, the Japanese navy is not only weaker than the United Kingdom and the United States in terms of quantity, but also inferior in terms of quality, which Japan cannot accept.

<p>London The Japanese government spokesman issued a declaration this morning criticizing the French proposal to the naval conference. French delegation officials were very surprised, saying that the outline of the French proposal was only submitted to the delegations of various countries this morning, and the detailed program has not yet been released. The Japanese criticism seems premature. (Havas dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>British Press Observations Naval Conference Achievements Unlikely</h3>
<p>London Various newspapers have recently commented on the future of the naval conference. Except for the Morning Post, which expressed optimism, the Daily Telegraph and the Japanese People's Voice both issued pessimistic tones. The Morning Post said, "According to the French proposal, each naval country should announce its shipbuilding procedures within one year. In this way, one of the biggest problems of the naval conference, namely the issue of quantitative restrictions, should be resolved as a result." As for the Daily Telegraph, it said, "France advocates that countries exchange information on shipbuilding procedures, but what is announced is only the tonnage, speed, and gun position of the ships to be built. As for the details of the combat power of each ship, which have always been regarded as top secrets by countries, they still cannot be released." The Daily People's Voice reported, "The naval conference is now caught in a storm, and the date of its overturning is not far away. A stalemate is unavoidable after this. The delegations of various countries have tried their best to overcome the difficulties, but they have all failed one after another. This is unavoidable." (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Comparison of Air Forces of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Tokyo Various countries are currently holding disarmament conferences in London to discuss ways to reduce military equipment, but they are separately planning the construction and expansion of various military equipment in their own countries, especially for naval aviation, and they are all devoting their full efforts to enrich their equipment in order to dominate the air in future wars, which is very noteworthy. The current state of enrichment of naval air forces in various countries is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>United States The current number of aircraft is 1,300. When the US Congress reviewed the Vinson shipbuilding plan last year, it decided to grant the navy the authority to increase its aircraft to the number necessary for the naval strength stipulated in the treaty, and limited the maximum number to 2,184. This project plans to manufacture 650 aircraft over five years. In the past year, it has increased 500 crew members to carry out education. When the US Navy launches a fleet attack across the ocean, it is absolutely necessary to first obtain the entire right to dominate the sea where the fleet will fight a decisive battle.</p>
<p>United Kingdom Currently maintains 990 aircraft (among 89 air squadrons, the fleet air force has 13 squadrons, 6 detachments, and 165 aircraft). Last year, it decided on a five-year plan to establish 33 more air squadrons in the country and 8 squadrons in fleet and overseas troops before 1937. According to this plan, the United Kingdom will maintain 2,500 aircraft and increase the number of aviation soldiers from the current 31,000 to 20,000 before 1937.</p>
<p>France The number of aircraft is 1,700 (among 165 squadrons, the naval air force has 53 squadrons and 510 aircraft). The French government started manufacturing 740 aircraft the year before last with a special additional budget of 620 million francs.</p>
<p>Italy The number of aircraft is 1,200 (including 190 naval aircraft). The year before last, it decided on a six-year plan to spend a temporary expenditure of 120 million lira, but last year it was shortened to a three-year plan. The Italian Air Force's heavy bombers can carry more than 1,000 tons of weight, and have a speed of 250 kilometers per hour and a range of 2,000 kilometers, which is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Germany 2,000 aircraft. Since Hitler declared the reorganization of military equipment, he has been building an air force and plans to expand the number of aircraft to around 3,500.</p>
<p>Soviet Union 2,700 land-based aircraft, 400 sea-based aircraft, for a total of 3,100 aircraft. At the end of last year, it built an aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Japan The total number of aircraft is 800. The Five-Year Plan will form 3 land-based air squadrons. Before the establishment of the London Treaty, there were 17 squadrons. After the establishment, 14 squadrons were added. In Showa 9, 8 new squadrons were established. The maritime forces have 4 aircraft carriers and 2 seaplane tenders.

<h3>Japan Plans to Set Up a Naval Exhibition Hall to Popularize Military Thought Among the Public</h3>
<p>Tokyo In order to make the people generally aware of "Japan of the Navy", with the purpose of popularizing naval military thought and cultivating the naval spirit, the Ministry of the Navy plans to build a naval hall with a budget of 450,000 yuan. The construction will start in the early spring of this year, and the opening is scheduled for the spring of Showa 12. The construction site is located on a 2,300-ping site on the east side of the Meiji Jingu Outer Garden. A two-story building made of cement and steel will be built. The interior is divided into exhibition rooms, libraries, lecture halls, etc. The exhibition department is divided into modern and historical departments, displaying various models and reference materials. It is heard that the president of the hall will be concurrently held by the Minister of the Navy, and the curator will be a naval official. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<h3>British-French Military Mutual Assistance Sea, Land, and Air Cooperation Implemented British and French Experts Complete Plan in Paris The Fleets of the Two Countries Will Conduct Joint Exercises in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Paris After six weeks of consultation between the staff members of the United Kingdom and France, the plan for the immediate cooperation of the naval, land, and air forces of the two countries has been completed today. If either of the two countries is attacked by another country, the other country will cooperate with all its strength. The military forces of the United Kingdom and France are now prepared to deal with any accidents. Whether the British fleet is attacked at sea in the Mediterranean, or the French border adjacent to Germany, Austria, and Italy is attacked by land, the two countries are very cautious. It is explained that this cooperation is not a secret military alliance, but only a technical preparation. According to the obligation of mutual assistance stipulated in the League of Nations, it is to deal with all accidents. France has designated arsenals, ports, and airports for the British army to use in France, and at the same time, the United Kingdom has also prepared to take on the responsibility of protecting the main coastal cities of France. It is reported that the British army will also assist the French army in defending the forts on the border. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>Paris The French military authorities refuse to disclose the results of the British-French staff headquarters meeting. The authorities only said that the recent discussions were "ordinary exchanges of views made by experts from the two countries in a friendly manner." A French external spokesman told reporters that the United Kingdom and France, in accordance with Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations, were studying the possibility of cooperation between the two countries in order to resist public enemies.

<p>Paris When the League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen meets in Geneva on January 20 to discuss the oil embargo against Italy, the French First and Second Squadrons will hold large-scale exercises in the Mediterranean. The First Squadron plans to train off the coasts of Provence and Corsica, and the Second Squadron first plans to cruise outside Gaza and Blanca, and then meet with the First Squadron. It is now believed that this exercise is the result of France's repeated commitment to assist the British Mediterranean fleet if it is attacked by Italy. At the same time, the captains of each ship of the Second Squadron will gather in Bress today to talk about war on paper, and they will discuss the strategic issue of what to do if the Second Squadron is attacked before setting off for Gaza and Blanca on January 14.

<p>London The Admiralty has just announced that the battleships "Nelson" and "Rodney" (34,000 tons each), the aircraft carrier "Furious", the cruiser "Cairo", and the 21st Destroyer Division are scheduled to hold spring exercises in the middle of this month. In addition, the battleship "Hotspur" and the cruisers "Leander", "Orion", and "Neptune" will sail back to their home countries from the Mediterranean. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Athens Three British destroyers arrived in the Port of Piraeus and dropped anchor this morning. The large battleship "Hotspur" (42,000 tons) and the three cruisers "Leander" and "Capetown" (their tonnage is 26,000 tons each) will also drop anchor in Greek territorial waters before the end of this month. The Republican newspaper Xenophon Theodoridis reported that after the recent exercise of the British warships in the Mediterranean, the personnel urgently need to rest, so they came to Greece. The reason for anchoring in Greek territorial waters is that the British Navy has come to Greece to interview and is very familiar with the situation of each port. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Concern About the Outbreak of War Greece Devotes Efforts to National Defense Army Minister's Clear Statement</h3>
<p>Athens Today, Army Minister Barboglis clearly stated in the "Anserbos" newspaper the attitude that Greece should take if a European war breaks out. "The European atmosphere is very tense, and no one dares to be sure that the great powers can find a peaceful solution. We absolutely hope for peace. If the war affects all members, Greece will fulfill its obligations as a member of the League of Nations. Regarding military preparations, the reports in the newspapers are somewhat inaccurate. It is certainly not right to say that Greece has no military preparations at all. It is also wrong to say that Greece is engaged in war preparations day and night. Greece's military organization is very tight. We firmly believe that military preparations are not difficult to complete." (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>British General Staff Advocates Implementing Oil Embargo Against Italy Believes It Is the Only Good Way to Stop the War</h3>
<p>Paris According to the "Observer" newspaper's London dispatch today, the British General Staff believes that implementing an oil embargo is a good way to stop the Italian-Abyssinian war. The General Staff also believes that the Italian-Abyssinian conflict must be stopped for the following reasons: If the war is prolonged, the Italian army will eventually suffer significant losses. If blacks win over whites in the war, its adverse effects on colonial countries will be very significant. As far as England is concerned, it will increase the national movements in Egypt, Palestine, and India. To preserve the balance of power in Europe, Italy's power in Europe should not be reduced. Italy's economic recovery relies heavily on British loans. This economic policy should not be stopped for a day. Therefore, the General Staff urges the British government to advocate an oil embargo. The newspaper also said that the atmosphere in London, Geneva, and Paris is in favor of this proposal, so the League of Nations Council meeting on January 20 will definitely pass this resolution and implement it on February 1. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>Geneva Tonight, before the League of Nations meets to discuss the oil embargo against Italy, all parties declare that the British General Staff is the most hopeful for the speedy end of the Italian-Abyssinian war. It is said that the best way to stop the war is to cut off Italy's military supplies, and it is appropriate to cut off the supply of oil, cotton, and ammunition, gradually making it feel the shortage of important supplies. The French authorities believe that the United Kingdom's attitude is now constrained by the increasingly serious riots in Egypt, and they also have to take into account the alliance between Germany and Italy. At the same time, experts here are convinced that the oil embargo will not be implemented before February 1, because they must wait for the United States to make a concrete decision on its neutrality policy.

<h3>No Progress in the Afghan War; Italy to Increase Troops in East Africa; Two Divisions of Famous Mountain Troops Await Dispatch; Government Orders Conscription of New Soldiers</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is eager to achieve military success before the start of the rainy season in Afghanistan. He has urged the Italian forces in East Africa to intensify their operations simultaneously on both the northern and southern fronts. He has also ordered a newly mobilized division of 17,000 soldiers to immediately depart for East Africa. Furthermore, he has sent the Undersecretary of the Air Force, Fan Er, to Asmara to inspect the air force on the northern front. Foreign military observers here believe that Mussolini's expanded operational plan indicates an imminent renewed effort to seize territory, or to acquire a corridor connecting the Italian territories of Eritrea and Somalia, as this corridor is one of the peace terms proposed by Mussolini. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government is now conscripting new soldiers to replenish the troops fighting in East Africa. Two orders were issued today: one ordering the formation of a new infantry division to join the six divisions approved last year, and another ordering the formation of an artillery division. The new infantry division is mainly to replenish the Alpine troops departing from Naples to East Africa tonight. The second order mandates the formation of security Blackshirt units to replenish the Blackshirt divisions sent to East Africa. This order is retroactive to February 15, 1935. These units will be assisted by regular army officers. Retired soldiers, except for those in the air force and special units, are eligible to enlist. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: The famous mountain troops, known as the "凡爾比斯特利亞" Division, will be completely dispatched to East Africa within days. Yesterday, several battalions of this division, totaling 4,000 infantry and artillery soldiers, departed first aboard the mail ship "康特衫蘭特". Tonight, another battalion will depart from the port of Naples on the ship "康特羅沙" for the front. Both ships are the largest and newest type of Italian merchant vessels. This is the first time they have been used to transport troops to East Africa. Other units will be transported to East Africa on the mail ship "意大利" on the 9th of this month. In addition, a division of mountain light infantry has now been concentrated at the port of Naples and will also depart from there within days to strengthen the forces in East Africa. Once these two divisions have fully departed, the number of regular Italian troops sent to East Africa since the start of the war will reach seven divisions. This does not include six divisions of Fascist Blackshirts and several divisions of local indigenous troops. The most recently established of these indigenous troops is the "利比亞" Division, which was formed yesterday in the Italian port of Tripoli. The Governor-General of Libya, General Balbo, personally conducted the flag presentation ceremony. One side of the flag bears the Italian tricolor national emblem, while the other side is green, symbolizing the unity and cooperation between Italy and Islam. The government has recently ordered the mobilization of the "哥西里亞" and "亞細亞泰" divisions, intending to send them to Libya immediately to increase the number of domestic troops there to four divisions.

<h3>Continuous Heavy Rains Hinder Italian Military Operations; Italian Planes Continuously Drop Poison Gas Bombs; Afghan Positions on the Northern Front Bombarded</h3>
<p>Akjing: There was a major thunderstorm in Akjing today, with heavy rains in the surrounding areas. According to travelers from Taixi, roads are difficult to travel and rivers have risen, and soon it may be impossible to cross them. If the rain does not stop, the war on the northern front will likely come to a standstill, but general opinion is that the Italian army will be more affected than the Afghan army. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Akjing: Unprecedented heavy rains since 1907 have completely halted the fighting on the northern front since last week, but the shortest periods of clear weather have been used by Italian planes to drop bombs behind Afghan lines and in rural areas, especially in the Xilei area.

<h3>Italian Army Commits Atrocities; Afghanistan Protests Again to the League of Nations; Destruction of the Laws of War Not Accidental</h3>
<p>Geneva: The Afghan government has again protested to the League of Nations against Italy's violation of the laws of war, stating that although the bombing of the Swedish Red Cross ambulance team by the Italian army has aroused indignation worldwide, the Italian army is still using poison gas on the northern front to continue its terror policy. Furthermore, the Italian army recently bombed the Red Cross ambulance team at Fengjiabao with bombs. This is not an accidental act of individuals, but a manifestation of a brutal policy to exterminate the Afghan people. Therefore, the Afghan government calls on the League of Nations to investigate to determine the truth of this violation of public law. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>After the US Agricultural Adjustment Act Became Invalid, the Secretary of Agriculture Convened a National Leaders' Meeting; Production Controls Continued as Usual</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt met with reporters today and stated that he would ask Congress to appropriate funds to pay farmers who had signed production restriction contracts under the Agricultural Adjustment Act in 1935. However, the President did not directly answer the question of the Supreme Court's ruling that the Act was invalid. The reporters asked three questions: What is the government's current rural plan? Will there be any legislation related to rural areas passed during this session of Congress? If Congress approves the requested appropriation, what kind of new tax will the government levy? The President repeatedly replied to these three questions, "There is no news on this point." (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of Agriculture Wallace suddenly gave a radio address today, stating that after the Agricultural Adjustment Act became invalid, the United States would likely face a rural crisis again within a few years. "After the business tax is abolished, the results may be quite good for one or two years, but after this period, the entire rural area of the country will be greatly reduced." Before the speech, Wallace had invited agricultural leaders from across the country to come here for a meeting to discuss future plans after the Supreme Court ruling. The meeting is scheduled to open on Friday. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: New Deal figures are maintaining a conservative silence regarding yesterday's Supreme Court ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was invalid. However, the White House urgently convened a meeting. After the meeting, it was learned that Congress will be asked to allocate $250,000,000 for farmer welfare expenses already being handled by the government. At the same time, an Associated Press reporter learned that the trend of the Supreme Court's ruling would likely follow one of the following paths: Amendment of the Constitution; equalization fees, export bonds, or domestic distribution plans; separation of progressive taxes and production controls; recommendations to limit the power of the Supreme Court; government subsidies to control food production. Dispatches from New England stated that the textile industry there was overjoyed to hear of the Supreme Court's ruling, and the Cotton Manufacturers Association also believed that it would benefit industry. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: The newspapers of the Scripps Howard chain said yesterday's Supreme Court rejection of the Agricultural Adjustment Act was a "resistance war" against Roosevelt and the United States, arguing that Roosevelt had only two paths to follow: to offer no resistance and accept the ruling, limiting all his political actions to the army, navy, and the District of Columbia; or to recognize the provocative action and appeal to the people to gauge public opinion as to whether they wished to be governed by their elected president and Congress, or by this deformed judicial body. These newspapers stated that they did not wish to criticize the ruling, as this court inherently had this power in law. However, the question now is whether the nation wishes to be governed by this judicial oligarchy, which cannot but become a major question. These newspapers further stated that the tyranny of the judiciary is very dangerous, because the judiciary is not subject to the control of popular elections. Finally, the newspapers raised a question: should today's government be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, or should it be a government ruled by the Supreme Court? (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Stable Sino-US Exchange Rate; Will Not Exceed 35 Cents</h3>
<p>The United States Has a Tendency Towards Inflation; US-Mexico Agreement to Exchange Gold for Silver</p>
<p>Washington: Commerce Department Financial Division Director Jones revealed during a report to the House of Representatives today that the price of one Chinese national currency will not exceed 35 US cents. He also stated that the current price of the Chinese national currency actually depends on the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound, because its exchange rate against the British pound does not exceed 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound does not exceed $4.92. Finally, Jones pointed out that after China's national silver management exchange depreciated the currency value, it could save the US Navy $1 million in US dollars when purchasing goods from China. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: Currency experts here feel today that inflation is in sight. The federal government may be forced to raise $2,583,000,000 to pay farmers' crop restriction subsidies owed by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Another inflationary factor is that Congress may pass a bill to pay $220,000,000 in cash for veteran benefits. However, if the courts force the government to return the taxes collected from merchants under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, an even more serious problem will arise. However, the general public believes that this will not happen. Officials are quite wary of this because the possible ruling that the farmer subsidies are illegal has exhausted them. Experts declared today that Congress may levy new taxes to pay the farmers, thereby avoiding inflation. However, if the government borrows new debt or issues banknotes, it will at least produce a slight inflationary effect. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>New York: Observers here believe that the US-Mexico silver agreement stipulates that the United States will exchange gold for Mexican silver, and that Mexico will adopt a system of gold and silver as reserves.

<p>Washington: The Senate Arms Investigation Committee met today to examine the case of Morgan Silver Company providing financial assistance to the Entente countries before the United States entered the Great War in 1917. A large number of police officers were stationed around the meeting place to provide security. Banking giants Morgan Lamont and Vanderbilt were summoned to testify. Morgan first stated the situation at the time, saying that Morgan Silver Company, due to Switzerland's violation of Belgium's neutrality and the European situation falling into crisis, feared that if Germany were to win the war, the "world's freedom and rights would be in danger of perishing." In order to avoid this, it decided to provide funds and goods to the Entente countries. He represented the governments of Britain and France in purchasing goods in the United States, with a total value of $3 billion. The commission earned by Morgan Silver Company was 1%, totaling $30 million. The first loan to the Entente countries was in 1915, at which time the Entente countries' finances had fallen into distress, so the loan was provided to help them. As for the Investigation Committee's claim that this loan was the main reason for the United States' entry into the war, it was not true. He always believed that the United States joined the Great War because Germany adopted an unrestricted submarine policy. After Morgan finished his statement, the committee members declared that Morgan's loan to the Entente countries was contrary to the United States' traditional policy of neutrality, which President Wilson had declared in August 1914 when the war broke out. Morgan replied that American banks had expressed sympathy to the Entente countries "since the beginning of the war." Lamont also stood up and stated that "spiritual neutrality is impossible." At this point, the committee members recalled the fact that the French government had borrowed $20 million using treasury bills as collateral, saying that Morgan had refused this loan because it violated the United States' neutral stance. However, not long after, Morgan agreed to purchase French public bonds. Later, in March 1915, when public opinion was favorable to the Entente countries, he organized a silver company to subscribe to as much as $50 million of French bonds, which shows a clear contradiction between the previous and subsequent circumstances. Lamont then said that his aid to the Entente countries was sincere. In 1915, another major American banker, Kuhn Loeb, had proposed lending money to Germany, so Morgan Silver Company quickly assisted France to deal with it. The committee then asked about the relationship between the late President Wilson and Morgan Silver Company, and between the State Department and the silver company. However, Morgan and the other two said that they had a poor memory due to the passage of time. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<p>Beiping Communication: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, took a special train from Ping to Baoding on the morning of the 7th to take office as Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government. Those traveling with him included Feng Zhian, commander of the 37th Division, Yin Zonglin of the Hebei Provincial Committee, Secretary-General Wang Shijiu, and more than 100 staff and guards. The special train departed from the West Station at 10:30 am and arrived in Baoding at approximately 2:00 pm. According to Song, who spoke to reporters at the station, after arriving in Baoding, he will inspect various agencies for a week and take office at 10:00 am on the 8th. After briefly handling provincial affairs, he will return to Ping on the 9th.</p>
<p>Song brought with him a Letter to the People of Hebei Province, which he plans to publish after arriving in Baoding. The original text is as follows: "In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China [1936], I took the position of Chairman of Hebei Province. I serve the country and always respect morality, with the determination to relieve the suffering of the people. If officials at all levels have any behavior that violates the law and disturbs the people, they will be punished according to the law. I have always been sincere, upright, and fair in doing things, not telling deceptive words or doing deceptive things, because hypocrisy is enough to destroy the country. I hope that all fellow countrymen will tell the truth, do practical things, value morality, and prevent the communists, so that everyone can live and work in peace, save themselves, and save the country. Song Zheyuan, January 7th."</p>
<p>The Hebei-Chahar Pacification Commissioner's Office has not yet been established since the central government formulated the organizational outline. It is reported that the organization will still be divided into six divisions and one office hall. After Song Zheyuan returns to Ping from Baoding, he will begin preparations for the establishment. It is expected that Song will take office as Director around the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Bao Yueqing, director of the Mongolian Political Affairs Council's office in Ping, previously went to Mongolia on Song Zheyuan's orders to meet with Prince De to discuss the stationing of the Mongolian Security Force in Chahar Province. On New Year's Eve of last year, he returned to Zhangjiakou. On the morning of the 6th of this month at 7:20 am, he arrived in Ping on the Ping-Sui train. According to Bao, "Since the puppet army of Li Shouxin's unit advanced from Guyuan, Baochang, Kangbao, and Huade to Zhangbei, the Chahar Provincial Government Security Force has already withdrawn to Shangdu. However, Li's unit is only concentrated in Zhangbei and has set up checkpoints there to inspect passing pedestrians. The other four counties have no puppet troops, and the local defenses are empty. The Mongolian Security Force of Zhuo Shihai's unit has been deployed to fill the defenses, with a total of 3,000 people. Each county is stationed with 400-500 people. Regarding the solution to the Chahar issue, Prince De only follows Chairman Song's suggestions. The Mongolian Political Affairs Council's affairs are currently being managed by Prince Yun at Bailingmiao. Prince De is still staying in Pangjiang because his mother's illness has not recovered. He has already sent personnel to Baochang and other places to call the flockmasters, summon Zhuo Shihai, and the general managers of various banners to Pangjiang De Wangfu for a meeting to discuss the Chahar issue. It is said that Li Shouxin is now in Zhangbei. I have not heard anything about Li convening a meeting there. The dispute between the Alashan Banner and the Ningxia Provincial Government is also one of the outstanding issues for the Mongolian banners. It is reported that the central government has sent Tang Kesan to Ping, who will then travel to the Northwest to mediate between the two sides. Tang knows Mongolian affairs well and has a close friendship with Ma Hongkui, Chairman of Ningxia Province. With his intervention, the issue may be resolved. In addition, the central government has not yet allocated the 700,000 yuan in construction funds for the Mongolian Political Affairs Council's address." (7th)</p>

<h3>Beining Railway Funds Intercepted by Yin Rugeng</h3>
<p>Large Stations Extract Funds Daily, Small Stations Every Three Days</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Beining Railway, from Tanggu eastward to Shanhaiguan, is 317 kilometers long, accounting for four-fifths of the entire Beining Railway trunk line. The puppet Jidong Autonomous Government recently established a puppet Xin Yu Section Railway Supervisory Office in Tangshan. The internal plan of this office was to set up six departments: Transportation, Machinery, Works, Accounting, Police, and General Affairs, to occupy this section of the railway. However, due to the involvement of British loans in the railway and after detailed audits, it was found that if the occupation were implemented, the passenger and freight revenue from Tanggu to Yuguan stations would be at most just over one million yuan per month. This figure is even based on peak months; during slow business periods, at most only 700,000 yuan could be obtained. After deducting expenses, there would be no surplus. Subsequently, with the assistance of a certain foreign railway expert in raising funds, it was decided to avoid the name of occupation and focus on intercepting railway funds. Although the puppet Supervisory Office was established, its internal organization was not ambitious. However, it severely monitored the railway funds of each station east of Tanggu, dispatching puppet troops to assist, forbidding the section chiefs and stationmasters to remit funds to Tianjin, and instead directly extracted the funds through the puppet Supervisory Office. Large stations extracted funds daily, while small stations did so every three days, all of which were sent to the puppet Supervisory Office in Tangshan for safekeeping. Tangshan, Yuguan, Tanggu, and Luanxian have already extracted more than 50,000 yuan in one week. The amount extracted from other small stations has not yet been reported to the railway bureau. Stationmasters and section chiefs are required to prepare two copies of any matters reported to the railway bureau, one submitted to the railway bureau and one submitted to the puppet Supervisory Office for review. When the railway bureau issues orders to each station, the section chiefs and stationmasters must also prepare a copy and send it to the puppet office for inspection. The puppet office has not issued any orders, but it is implementing its puppet supervisory power to prevent the section chiefs and stationmasters from plotting anything detrimental to their side. The Beining Railway Bureau is currently anxious because the puppet organization is intercepting railway funds for a long time, leaving the railway bureau with only expenses and no income. The salaries of all employees and all other expenses will be impossible to maintain. If a solution is not found quickly, not only will austerity measures be necessary, but also preparations must be made to borrow money to maintain future expenses. Therefore, the Jidong issue must be resolved quickly, and the Beining Railway issue must be addressed and the interception of funds stopped as soon as possible. (6th)</p>

<p>Four Supplementary Articles to the Agreement: Old Property Deeds to Be Exchanged for New Ones</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The agreement on the recovery of the Kuling British Concession was formally signed by Jiang Zhicheng, Director of the Lushan Management Bureau, and the British side on December 30, 1935.

<h3>Shandong Tobacco Production Increases</h3>
<p>But Value Declines, Many Tobacco Merchants Suffer Losses</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Various counties along the Jiaoji Railway in eastern Shandong are abundant in tobacco production, with tobacco quality superior to that produced in Bengbu and Henan. In addition, it is close to the railway, making transportation convenient, and in previous years it was a major source of income for the region. Not only was it sold to Shanghai, but many tobacco factories in the province also used it. In recent years, tobacco prices have fallen, significantly less than before. Last year's production was more than in previous years. The output of Linzi, Yidu, Weixian, and Anqiu counties have all increased. However, tobacco merchants and small companies have traditionally purchased from farmers before harvest and then resold to large companies. Last year, due to the low tobacco prices, many of those engaged in this business suffered irreparable losses, and some went bankrupt. By the end of the year, most of the Chinese and foreign tobacco companies along the railway had successively stopped weighing tobacco. The total amount collected by each company was more than 660 tons, with a value of about 15 million yuan. The results of the investigation are compared as follows: Yizhong Company (formerly reorganized from the British-American Tobacco Company) purchased the most, over 9 million yuan, averaging 16 yuan per hundred pounds; Linhua Company was second (formerly renamed from the British American Tobacco Company); Huacheng Company had over 1 million yuan; Nanyang Company had several hundred thousand yuan; Mixing had 500,000 yuan; Nanxin had over 200,000 yuan; and the remaining companies had over 1 million yuan. As for the tobacco production locations, Tanjiafangzi, at the border between Shouguang and Changle counties, benefited the most, because the soil is more fertile and the tobacco color is superior. Some sold for over 70 yuan per hundred pounds. The highest income per mu was 260-270 yuan, and the lowest was 70-80 yuan. Weixian was the worst, with the highest income per mu being over 100 yuan, and some earning less than 20 yuan. The reason is mainly due to soil conditions. Some have continuously planted tobacco for 15 years, and the inferior tobacco color is naturally expected. Comparing the export locations, Xindian had the most, with over 1,100 cars transported out via the Jiaoji Railway. Tobacco produced in Linzi, Changshan, and Huantai mostly concentrated here, with a value of 5 million yuan. Tanjiafangzi had 600 cars, worth 3 million yuan; Yidu had 800-900,000 yuan; Yangjiazhuang had 7-800,000 yuan; Weixian had 2-300,000 yuan; Ershilibu had 1 million yuan; Hamatun had 500,000 yuan; Huangqibao had 1 million yuan. However, the value was lower. What used to be 30 yuan per hundred pounds is now only worth 60-70% of that. The companies have now stopped collecting, and many tobacco farmers still have unsold tobacco in storage.</p>
<p>Songjiang County Government Actively Combating Opium</p>
<p>The province is implementing a policy to prohibit opium. Opium smokers holding licenses are being ordered to quit. So far, the county has reached its thirteenth batch. Although many have followed the summons and have surrendered themselves to be cured, many others who used false names when registering for a license have not been found when summoned, and are still addicted. After County Magistrate Li took office, he took opium prohibition as one of the main policies of the province. He could not perfunctorily ignore this, so he issued a list of the names of the opium smokers holding licenses who have been repeatedly summoned but have not been found, or have delayed treatment, to the various district offices, ordering the heads of the bao and jia to investigate and arrest them together with the police officers of the Public Security Bureau. In recent days, various districts have been investigating, arresting, and sending those arrested to the county in many instances. Furthermore, according to a provincial order, in order to be cautious in imprisonment and lenient in punishment, opium smokers who have not obtained a license are allowed to register for self-rehabilitation from January 1 to the end of the month, and be subject to the law. After the deadline, the heads of the bao and jia will report them and they will be punished for private smoking. The heads of the bao and jia must also provide a written guarantee that there are no private smokers within their area. If a private smoker is found after the guarantee, the head of the bao and jia who concealed the fact will also be subject to appropriate punishment. This self-rehabilitation registration was widely publicized last year in December, and the heads of the bao and jia were responsible for investigating, listing, and reporting. Now that the deadline for self-rehabilitation registration is about to expire, the time for the general inspection of opium and drug offenders is approaching. The county's Anti-Opium Committee has followed the order to conduct a general inspection and expanded the publicity, formulating publicity guidelines and distributing them to various districts. The county government has recently convened representatives from various agencies to discuss ways to implement this public awareness campaign.</p>
<p>Nanhui Buying Silver Dollars Punishable by Seven Years</p>
<p>Jiang Liansheng, Chen Miaohong, and Zhang Amao from Shanghai bought silver dollars in Zhoupu Town in this county on October 8 last year. They were seized by the people of the town and sent to the First Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau. 108 silver dollars were found, and they were sent to the county for interrogation and detention. The verdict was handed down on the fourth, and the three defendants were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The 108 silver dollars were confiscated.</p>
<p>Suzhou Private Transportation of Raw Silver Reported to the Province for Instructions</p>
<p>Xia Liben, an employee of the Suzhou Youhuo Bank, went to Zhejiang to collect more than 2,500 taels of raw silver in preparation for transporting it to Shanghai. However, he was found by the police at the Pingwang Town bus station in Wujiang County. Although he had a silver transport passport from the Ministry of Finance, the numbers and dates did not match, and the handwriting on the passport was in both brush and fountain pen. He was deemed to be transporting it privately. The witnesses were also detained and sent to the Wujiang County Government on the seventh for interrogation and detention. County Magistrate Xu of the county believed that Xia Liben was suspected of forging a passport and privately transporting raw silver, in serious violation of the provincial order. On the eighth, he reported the incident to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for instructions.</p>
<p>Wuxi Dozens of Lake Bandits Continuously Rob Farmhouses</p>
<p>The Weijiali area, about three li away from Huadafang Village in the third district of the county, is located on the shore of Taihu Lake. The village is remote, and the residents, such as Zhou Yonggen and Zhou Aquan, are farmers and are doing well. Recently, the new grains have been harvested, which attracted the attention of the bandits. At about 4 o'clock in the morning on the seventh, more than 20 lake bandits suddenly came to the village, driving small boats, each holding pistols, flashlights, short knives, and other weapons. They first went to Zhou Aquan's house, climbed over the walls, and tied up more than a dozen people, young and old, and searched at will. Then they went to Zhou Yonggen's house and tied up the whole family in the same way, allowing them to search. After two hours, they left with their loot. After the incident, the lost items were checked, and it was found that the two families were robbed of more than 30 yuan in legal tender and more than 30 dan of white rice, totaling 4-500 yuan in losses.</p>
<p>Yangzhou County Government Sets Up a Questioning Office for Opium Smokers</p>
<p>The county government has recently started the self-rehabilitation registration for opium smokers. However, because people's knowledge is limited, although proclamations have been issued frequently to explain the registration procedures, it is feared that they may not be able to understand them and miss the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves. Therefore, the county government has stipulated measures for opium smokers to ask questions, ordering district, township, and town offices, bao chiefs' offices, as well as the Public Security Bureau and its various sub-bureaus and teams, to set up self-rehabilitation opium smoker inquiry offices in their respective locations, and to provide detailed explanations to opium smokers who have questions at any time.</p>
<p>Nantong Military Police Search and Suppress Local Bandits in the Southern Countryside</p>
<p>Bandit flags have recently been unstable in Tongyi. According to reports, the Nantong District Commissioner's Office learned that a large group of local bandits was gathering in the southern countryside. On the morning of the seventh, Commissioner Xu Zhen, supervised the security team. The chief of the Public Security Bureau, Song Mingqi, led the police team to Yongxing, Zhuhang, Xingang and other towns to conduct a large-scale search and suppression. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The military and police surrounded and captured 21 bandits, and sent them to the Commissioner's Office for interrogation.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Lake Palace Hotel Guest Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Gan Shitian, a young traveler in his twenties, arrived at the Lake Palace Hotel on Yingzi Road in Hangzhou City on the fourth of this month. He checked into room number ten and there was nothing unusual. He suddenly took poison while sleeping with the door closed on the evening of the seventh. At eleven o'clock on the morning of the eighth, the room attendant called but there was no response. Knowing that something was wrong, he opened the door and entered. The guest was lying stiff on the bed and had died. He reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which informed the Hangzhou Local Court to send officials for inspection. The guest's books indicated that he was from Jiangsu Province. He had no money on him. It is presumed that he committed suicide due to economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Ningbo Yuyao Salt Tide Becomes Tense Again</p>
<p>More than 200 salt farmers in the second and third districts of eastern Yuyao gathered at the Xiangong Temple on the morning of the fifth, due to the fact that the four major salt factories in Zhejiang, namely, Dong, Wu, Gong, and Yuantai, have been delaying the purchase of salt, causing them to suffer from hunger and cold. They often sent representatives to inquire at the Gongxing Factory, but they did not receive a satisfactory answer. They took Feng Meiyan, the accountant of the factory, to the Andongchang Office, requesting punishment and urging the factory to speed up the purchase of salt. The head of the field comforted the salt farmers and ordered the accountant, Feng Meiyan, to contact the factory and open it for collection within five days. The salt farmers gradually dispersed upon hearing this. Therefore, the situation in the salt field has become tense again in recent days.</p>

<h3>Domestic Exchange Fees Regulations Domestic and Foreign Exchanges are Settled at the BOC Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>New Sound News Agency reported that since the implementation of the new currency system policy, domestic exchange has tended to be balanced. The Bankers Association has abolished the Market Committee, and stopped publishing market prices every day from January 4. The Central, China, and Communications Banks have newly formulated domestic exchange handling fee methods, which are recorded as follows: Exchange to other provinces, the fee is one yuan per thousand yuan. Exchange to this province, the fee is five jiao per thousand yuan. For exchanges below one hundred yuan, the minimum fee is one jiao. For exchanges over one hundred yuan, the minimum fee is two jiao. All banks operating domestic exchanges have now handled the above-mentioned methods.</p>
<p>Stable Foreign Exchange: After the Central, China, and Communications Banks bought and sold foreign exchange without restrictions, the foreign exchange market has stabilized. Yesterday morning, the Central Bank's exchange rate for London was one shilling and two and a half pence, and for New York it was twenty-nine US dollars. The exchange rate quoted by HSBC was slightly lower. The Chinese banks that also handled foreign exchange were Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Shanghai, Dongya, Kenye, Guohuo, Guohua, Huaqiao, Dalu, Zhongfu, Zhongnan, Zhongxing, Jincheng, and Qiye, totaling fourteen. They are now all settled according to the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank. Foreign banks are all engaged in foreign exchange, but now, because there is no profit to be made, they have restricted buying and selling.</p>
<p>Private Smuggling Disappears</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee announced yesterday morning at ten o'clock that the equalization tax rate was 9%, which was 1.25% higher than yesterday's. In addition, because the method for foreign banks to hand in cash for exchange has been negotiated, foreign silver prices have plummeted. Therefore, those who pay taxes for export and those who smuggle have disappeared.</p>

<p>The Hunan Provincial Government, in order to complete the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, which was lacking funds, sent Yu Jichuan, Director of the Provincial Department of Construction, to Shanghai on the 20th of last month. After contacting Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank, Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, the banks have agreed to jointly lend 1.5 million yuan. The loan contract has been formally signed. The Central Bank will borrow 600,000 yuan, the Bank of China will borrow 600,000 yuan, and the Bank of Communications will borrow 300,000 yuan, totaling 1.5 million yuan.

<h3>Guangxi Agricultural Inspection Group Leaves Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon to Return to Gui</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that in order to improve agriculture in Guangxi Province, the Guangxi Provincial Government specially dispatched Huang Shaogeng, the county magistrate of Guixian County, and technicians from the Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, totaling 12 people, to form an agricultural inspection group to rural areas in Japan and throughout the country for reference. The group came to Shanghai a few days ago, and the reporter met Mr. Huang at his residence to inquire about the inspection. According to him, they departed from Gui in mid-November of last year and divided into three groups. One group was responsible for inspecting rural administration, one group was responsible for inspecting rural economy, and one group was responsible for inspecting agricultural technology. All matters related to rural areas, such as management organization, centralized transportation, horticulture, fertilization, and afforestation, were carefully inspected separately. The inspection in Japan lasted two months, and they visited rural areas throughout the country. They generally observed that the hard life and hard work of Japanese farmers is worthy of our admiration. At the same time, the Japanese government's efforts to assist and guide rural areas have been very effective. After completing the inspection in Japan, they originally planned to return to China and go north to inspect Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Anhui and other provinces. However, due to time constraints and the fact that everyone had duties that needed to be dealt with urgently, they had to temporarily change their plans. Except for seven people who went to Taiwan for inspection during the time in Japan, he and four members of the group returned to China and went to Jinhua, Lanxi, Cixi, Zhenjiang and other places for inspection, and returned to Shanghai only the day before yesterday. It is learned that the group took the President Jefferson ship south last afternoon. The day before yesterday evening, Huang Jingwan and Gu Shunhua, communication officers of the Commercial Press, specially hosted a farewell dinner for Huang and others at the Tongxinglou Restaurant on Simalu Road.</p>

<h3>French Municipal Council Approves Telephone Price Increase</h3>
<p>The issue of Shanghai Telephone Company's telephone price increase has recently been resolved in the French Concession. It is said that it has been decided to implement it in the French Concession starting from March 1st this year. The French Shanghai Daily, translated by the Foreign News Agency, records the following:</p>
<p>According to the French Concession Municipal Council, the official acceptance of the telephone price increase was actually decided at the board meeting on December 30, 1935. The reasons for the acceptance are threefold:  The number of telephones in the French Concession is relatively small, so opposing the price increase would not be able to withstand the pressure of the majority in the Public Concession.  The Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession has publicly accepted and announced it. If the French Concession authorities were to oppose it alone, it would undermine the unity of all foreign groups.  The review report of the French Concession on the telephone price increase is largely the same as the review report of the Public Concession. For these reasons, the Municipal Council decided to accept the Shanghai Municipal Council and decided to implement the price increase in both concessions simultaneously from March 1, 1936. However, the French Concession Municipal Council has several reservations attached to the acceptance of the price increase:  The money paid by the Shanghai Telephone Company to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation.  The operating expenses of the company's New York office.  The income tax levied on the company by the U.S. government. The above three items were not originally within the scope of the patent agreement, so the company should list them separately for future research when revising telephone charges. In addition, the French Concession Municipal Council also urged the telephone company to pay attention to improving the costs incurred in installing and repairing automatic machines, etc. Since the French Concession Municipal Council agreed to the telephone price increase, the price increase will be implemented on March 1st. The price increase method is as follows:  Shops: 10 yuan per month, limited to 150 calls. Each additional call will be charged 3 cents.  Private residences: 6.5 yuan per month, limited to 100 calls. Each additional call will be charged 3 cents.  Extension fee: 6 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Dalu Daily reports that the French Concession Municipal Council held a special meeting on December 30 last year and approved the Shanghai Municipal Council's resolution to charge telephone fees per call. It will formally notify the Shanghai Telephone Company of this within a few days. At the same time, the French Concession Municipal Council has several points that are not yet clear regarding the basis for calculating the fees, so it made certain reservations when approving the charging per call. In addition, the French Concession Municipal Council needs to investigate the past and present costs of installing, repairing, and maintaining automatic telephone exchanges from an economic standpoint to determine whether they are reasonable. Yesterday, a reporter from Dalu Daily asked the Shanghai Telephone Company about the resolution of the French Concession Municipal Council. According to an official of the company, the company did not want to express its opinion before receiving the official notification from the French Concession Municipal Council regarding the approval of charging per call.</p>

<h3>Heavy Weight of Opium Discovered on Shanghai-Beijing Through Train, Onboard Police Received Report and Searched Back and Forth, Criminal Fearing Guilt Escaped Mid-Journey</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai-Beijing through train No. 301 on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway received a secret report from Pukou Station of the Jinpu Railway when it departed from Beijing, stating that a drug trafficker disguised as a passenger boarded the train in Xuzhou, carrying a heavy weight of opium, and requesting a strict investigation. Dong Guangrui, the police officer on duty, heard the news and, considering that the case involved drug trafficking, searched back and forth. Unexpectedly, the drug trafficker, fearing guilt, escaped mid-journey. When the train arrived at its destination, Shanghai North Station, a large number of boxes, wicker baskets, and bedding were found in the third-class carriage without anyone claiming them. Chen, the stationmaster, reported this to the North Station Police Section patrol officer Yuan Shengbiao, and they inspected the items in public. On the spot, eleven packages of opium of various sizes were found in the bedding, all packed in pillows and tightly sealed. After being weighed, it was found to be sixteen kilograms. They were immediately sent to the North Station Police Office for investigation. Zhong Jianhun, the chief of the police section, thought that there might be more concealed drugs in the large number of luggage. He and Stationmaster Chen jointly unpacked and inspected them one by one. As a result, they found that a wicker basket full of biscuits was suspiciously heavier than it should be. Upon closer inspection, they found that there was an interlayer, and four packages of opium weighing six kilograms were found in the interlayer. It is reported that the total amount of opium was twenty-two kilograms (approximately five hundred taels). The police section is indignant that such a large amount of opium dared to be trafficked from the north to Shanghai to poison the people and has decided to send it to the Songhu Garrison Command and request the arrest of the fugitive involved in the case to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Business Performance Report: Trust and Savings Deposits Reach 9 Million Yuan, Qiuhong Wharf Project to Be Completed in August-September, Central Savings Society to Open in the Near Future</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, which opened on October 1 last year, has achieved astonishing development in its business in just three months. Its trust and savings deposits have reached 9 million yuan, the amount of insurance reaches 170 million yuan, and the insurance premium income is about 100,000 yuan. The number and amount of materials entrusted to the government by various agencies is very large, and other businesses have also achieved considerable results. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Trust Business</p>
<p>The Bureau's trust business covers a wide range of areas. The current businesses include:  Trust deposits, including current, fixed-term, and fund trusts. Because of its superior benefits and simple procedures, there are many depositors.  Trust investment, including mortgage lending, purchasing securities, and depositing in banks. The Bureau uses the most reliable methods for investment in accordance with its regulations, so it can be said that the guarantee is stable.  Special trust, including credit guarantee and various enterprise trusts, which has won the trust of society.  Collection of money and entrusted investigation matters have also been carried out.</p>
<p>Savings Business</p>
<p>The savings of civil servants and soldiers are one of the Bureau's main businesses. The regulations on civil servant savings are currently being reviewed by the central government and will be announced soon. The regulations on military savings have already been promulgated. They have been implemented in Beijing since July last year, and various agencies, troops, and schools outside Beijing have also been ordered to implement them step by step starting from New Year's Day this year. Before the New Year, those who contacted the Bureau were constantly coming and going. Those who first sent their existing savings to the Bureau include aviation, customs, salt administration, tax police agencies, public security bureaus, and other special action teams, which are a considerable number. There are also other government agencies and public organizations that will transfer their pension and compensation to the Bureau for safekeeping and interest.</p>
<p>Property Insurance</p>
<p>The insurance of public property is stipulated in the Bureau's regulations. Since the establishment of the Bureau, the National Government has ordered all agencies to handle insurance through the Bureau. The insurance department of the Bureau has already handled the following:  Property insurance, including fire insurance, water insurance, car insurance, etc.  Personal insurance, including life insurance, personal accident insurance, etc.  Insurance business in important places in the country is handled by the Bureau's local agencies separately. The agencies that have already insured their property with the Bureau include the Central Bank, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the Postal Bureau, the State-owned China Merchants Bureau, the Supervisory Audit Office, etc. Other agencies are also contacting one after another. Starting from this year, all insurance will be handled by the Bureau.</p>
<p>Qiujiang Wharf</p>
<p>This matter was originally handled by a design meeting. After the establishment of the Bureau, it was reorganized into the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee, which plans all affairs of the wharf. The Qiujiang Wharf Affairs Office was established in the Bureau's Trust Department to handle the matter. The things that have been done before the New Year include:  Bidding for the construction of wharf warehouses, which has been contracted by the Innovation Factory. Construction is now underway. A total of three installments of construction fees have been issued, totaling more than 460,000 yuan.  Requisitioning more than 272 mu of land for the Kunlian Wharf. In addition to the more than 258 mu that have been requisitioned, a total of 190,352 yuan has been paid in compensation. There are also subsidies for demolition, relocation of graves, and agricultural losses.  The mud-filling project of the wharf and the raising of the requisitioned land are being handled separately by the Bureau's entrusted dredging and dredging avoidance.  The construction of Wujin Road has been agreed upon by the dredging avoidance and the Shanghai Municipal Government and will begin construction soon. It is reported that the wharf project is expected to be completed in August and September this year. This construction is closely related to the prosperity of the central area of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Establish Savings Society</p>
<p>In addition, the Bureau has been specially approved by the government to establish a Central Savings Society. Because the procedures are more complicated, the preparations have not been completed before the New Year.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Strictly Prohibits Handmade Cigarettes, Deregistration to Be Revoked in Four Stages Starting from January This Year, Complete Prohibition by April 1937</h3>
<p>In order to maintain cigarette tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance strictly prohibits handmade cigarettes and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order the provincial and municipal governments to earnestly assist in the investigation and prohibition of handmade cigarettes. The Ministry of Railways has also been ordered to order the railway bureaus to pay attention to prevention and confiscate smuggling.  The Ministry of Railways has already ordered its subordinate railway bureaus to comply.  The original report of the Ministry of Finance is as follows: (Omitted above)  Since the cigarette tax was changed to a unified tax and the tax rates have been increased several times, the revenue has increased sharply. In recent years, the unified tax has been the largest source of central revenue, second only to customs and salt taxes. Cigarettes account for an important part of the unified tax revenue. Military and government expenses rely on its maintenance. The ability to achieve this result depends entirely on the centralization of production and on-site collection of taxes. According to the unified tax regulations, off-site production and sales are strictly prohibited. Handmade cigarettes can be made anywhere, are scattered and difficult to manage, and are difficult to prevent from being privately manufactured and sold, which directly hinders tax revenue and indirectly affects military and government expenses. It is extremely serious. It was originally intended to be completely prohibited, but in order to maintain the current livelihoods of the poor in the nearby regions that produce smoked tobacco, the area was identified and temporarily approved for registration, declaring that it was limited to personal self-manufacture and local sales, and was not allowed to be transported to other places, in order to crack down and avoid proliferation. On the one hand, the Ministry is currently formulating a method for phased prohibition, which will be announced and implemented. All registered cigarette households should revoke their registration by drawing lots every four months starting from January 1936, until complete prohibition by April 1937, so that they have room to change careers. This is to sympathize with the personal livelihood of the poor and cannot be discussed in the same way as the ordinary cessation of business. The manufacturing of smoked tobacco in the smoked tobacco producing area that has been approved for registration must be phased out. In addition, households that have not registered and are privately manufacturing are of course absolutely prohibited, and the people of each province are taking advantage of the opportunity of increased cigarette tax rates, and handmade cigarettes have low profits and heavy profits. Knowing that private cigarettes violate the ban, they still follow suit. In addition to the designated area, non-tobacco producing areas are also engaged in private cigarette manufacturing and sales. The spread is extensive, and even in the remote towns and villages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, there are local bullies everywhere, and some are engaged in large-scale iron machine handmade private cigarettes for profit. There are even those who falsely use the name of the military to protect private transportation, so that private cigarettes are becoming more and more rampant, and machine-made factory cigarettes are becoming more and more stagnant. This has been particularly evident in recent months. If we do not seek remedy urgently, we are sincerely worried that the situation will continue to deteriorate. In addition, the current cigarette unified tax rate is 160 yuan for the upper level and 81 yuan for the lower level per 50,000 cigarettes in a box. At this time of market decline, manufacturers pay this heavy tax and barely manage to support themselves, relying entirely on the fairness of the unified tax system. Since the country levies heavy taxes, it should take care to maintain and pay attention to investigation and suppression. If handmade private cigarettes are allowed to proliferate, not only will manufacturers justifiably criticize and be unable to cope, but in fact, heavy-tax factory cigarettes are impossible to compete with tax-free private cigarettes. If this continues, legitimate manufacturers will one day be unable to maintain themselves, and if the unified tax system is shaken as a result, the original income will inevitably be sharply reduced, and the military and government expenses that should be paid will also be a problem. Thinking about the future, I am very worried. I have repeatedly issued orders to my subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit them. However, handmade private cigarettes are scattered everywhere, and there are not many officials in the collection agency, and their eyes and ears are difficult to cover everything. If the local administrative agencies do not assist in the investigation and prohibition, it will be difficult to achieve results. After repeated consideration, I can only ask the Executive Yuan to order the provincial and municipal governments to order the local administrative leaders in their jurisdiction to strictly prohibit private cigarette manufacturing and prevent it from spreading, and to instruct each county to include the investigation and prohibition of handmade private cigarettes in the Baojia regulations. If found, they should be held jointly and severally liable for punishment, so that everyone knows that private cigarette manufacturing violates the law and discipline, and can completely eradicate the roots to maintain the source of taxation. The handmade wooden machine cigarettes in the smoked tobacco producing areas near Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces, except for iron machines that are absolutely not allowed to manufacture cigarettes and should be seriously investigated and suppressed, should be limited to the cigarette households that have been temporarily approved for registration, and can only be transported and sold locally, and must not be transported to other parts. They will still be phased out by drawing lots. In addition, the manufacture of handmade cigarettes is not allowed to comply with the original plan. Attached is a list of the smoked tobacco producing areas in the three provinces of Yu, Lu, and Wan, as well as a list of the Qing Dynasty wooden machine handmade cigarette households approved for registration, which I would like to send with the document for inspection. At the same time, I request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Railways to order its subordinate railways to pay attention to the prevention of handmade cigarettes, and to confiscate them, and at the same time to start the Military Commission to order the local defense forces to assist in the investigation and suppression at any time, so as to stop private manufacturing. The country's future is deeply beneficial. I have presented the reason for the proposed order to strictly prohibit private cigarette manufacturing, together with a copy of the table and book, to the Executive Yuan for consideration and implementation, and I beg for instructions to follow. I am eagerly waiting for orders.</p>

<p>Declaration</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Now, Yin Rugeng has openly rebelled, severing himself from the nation. Throughout history, those who have sought foreign assistance have invariably destroyed their own country. The disasters caused by the Uyghurs and Tartars are clearly recorded in history. If we continue to tolerate and indulge, the "Ronin" [Japanese vagrant] can manufacture public opinion, and the Chinese traitors can be treated as honored guests, using the name of economic cooperation to carry out dumping and invasion, with countless conspiracies, shocking the entire country. This time, students in Beiping witnessed the situation and were heartbroken, rising up to save the country, only to be massacred by military police. Students across the country responded, appealing and marching, but North China remains as precarious as a pile of eggs. The pace of aggression is accelerating. The losses and pain suffered by the seamen's organizations affiliated with this association under these humiliating circumstances are unspeakable. Companies in the north are on the verge of bankruptcy, the number of unemployed is increasing daily, and crew members sailing to the Northeast are subjected to abuse. Before the country is broken, the home is gone; before the person dies, the heart is dead. Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder. In this time of crisis, it is believed that only the unity and rise of all the people of the country can find a way out for the survival of the nation. It is especially hoped that the government will lead the people of the whole country to work together to save the crisis. After deliberation by the congress, the following demands are made to the people and government of the country: Oppose the nominal autonomy of North China in order to preserve the absolute integrity of territorial sovereignty, and punish Yin Rugeng, who seeks foreign assistance and willingly harms the country. Make public Sino-Japanese diplomacy and clearly announce the agreements that have been signed. Support patriotic movements, release arrested students and citizens, and severely punish the culprits. Open up freedom of assembly, association, and speech for the people, and abolish censorship of the press.</p>

<h3>Rice and Wheat Grading Group Collects Over 300 Kinds of Wheat; Rural Economies Across Regions are Panicked</h3>
<p>According to the Guo Wen News Agency, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau previously found the grades of rice and wheat in our country to be extremely mixed. It specifically added a rice and wheat grading group to the bureau to handle grading matters. The group is now officially operating and has stipulated that the first year's work will be a "wheat grading year." A month ago, it dispatched rice and wheat specialists Wang Zhengchao, Zhou Fengming, etc., to various counties in Jiangsu Province to collect various types of wheat for use as specimens for research. The reporter met with Wang Zhengchao, a specialist from the group, yesterday. Mr. Wang had just returned from the counties and said that after leaving Shanghai at the end of November last year, he first went to Nanjing, and then to Jurong, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, Jiangyin, Suzhou, Changshu, Wujiang, and other counties, obtaining more than 300 kinds of wheat samples. Among them, the "Wuxi Longshan Huang," "Changshu Longsui Baike," and "Suzhou Zipi" are the most famous. The distribution centers for wheat in Jiangsu Province are Zhenjiang, Lvcheng, Benniu, Qishuyan, Wuxi, Suzhou, etc., and in Benniu alone, more than 18,000 packages (each package weighing over 100 jin by market scale) are transported daily when the new wheat is released on the market. As for the rural economy in various counties, it is very panicked, especially in Jiangning, Jurong, Zhenjiang, Danyang, and other counties. Some farmers are even running out of food. The situation is better south of Changzhou, in Wuxi, Yixing, Jiangyin, Suzhou, and other counties, but it is still much worse than in previous years. The above is only a report from various counties in Jiangnan. The counties north of the Yangtze River were collected by Zhou Fengming, who has now left Yangzhou and Funing, and has transferred to Zhenjiang to take a car to Xuzhou, Haizhou, and other places. It will take another month before he can return to the bureau. It is planned to start inspection and grading after the varieties from various places have been collected, and so on.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Commission, had his resignation repeatedly requested to be withdrawn by the Central Government and has already dismissed the idea of resigning. Mr. Xu then went to Beijing a few days ago to meet with President Jiang and Vice President Kong to ask for instructions on handling the spring relief affairs, which have now been completed. He returned to Shanghai from Beijing last night. Ms. Chen Bijun, wife of Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, entered Beijing a few days ago to report to the Central Government on the current situation of Wang's injury, which has now been completed. She returned to Shanghai by car from Beijing yesterday morning. After getting off the car, she immediately returned to her private residence on Anhe Temple Road to rest. It is also known that Zhong Ming, a member of the Central Committee, also arrived in Shanghai on the same train. After a short rest after getting off the train, he went to Wang's residence to visit.</p>
<h3>Cheng Haifeng Discusses the Labor Situation in Zhenjiang and Wuxi: Labor Equipment in Wuxi Factories is Relatively Complete; Zhenjiang Has Not Fully Shed the Era of Handicraft Industry</h3>
<p>Cheng Haifeng, Director of the China Branch of the International Labor Office, personally went to Zhenjiang and Wuxi last December to inspect the labor situation. He returned to Shanghai during the New Year holiday and immediately drafted an inspection report to be submitted to the Geneva Bureau. According to a report yesterday to the New Voice News Agency reporter, the old man inspected the labor situation in Zhenjiang and Wuxi last year. He first went to Zhenjiang to contact the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and then stayed in Zhenjiang to inspect. Zhenjiang Provincial City does not have large-scale factories, and the era of handicraft industry has not completely passed. Zhenjiang has an organization of the General Federation of Trade Unions, which was established in September last year. Its future plan is to merge the past scattered trade unions into the federation to fully seek the welfare of the labor sector. Later, personnel were dispatched by the Jiangsu Construction Department to accompany him to Wuxi. There are 60 factories in Wuxi that meet the factory law, and many other small factories. Cotton spinning, silk weaving, flour, and other factories are the most numerous. The labor equipment of each factory, such as worker dormitories, is considered complete, and the working environment of the workers is also good. Regarding labor welfare, the Shenxin No. 3 Factory is the best. Trade union organization in Wuxi is not universal, and the number of female workers is slightly higher. Silk weaving factories used child labor in the past, but have recently switched to new-style machines, and child labor has been eliminated. What I felt most deeply was that the unemployment problem in Zhenjiang and Wuxi is quite serious. This problem is not only limited to Zhenjiang and Wuxi, but also felt in all the places I inspected. The only way to solve unemployment is to revive the economy. Another thing that I felt most painful was the rickshaw pullers and dockworkers in Zhenjiang and Wuxi. They work hard every day and earn very little. Their daily life is the most painful among the workers. The government authorities should have a way to relieve them, he said.</p>
<h3>US Air Force Special Envoy to China, Patterson, Left Shanghai for Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Sun Sun Company Opens for Business Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since Cai Chang, the general supervisor of the Sun Sun Company, came to Shanghai to plan and prepare for its establishment, more than a year has passed. The entire building has now been completed. It is majestic and new, and the style is extremely beautiful. The interior is also very novel and spacious. Starting from the first floor, there are escalators connecting up to the third floor, which is especially unique. It is scheduled to open on the 10th of this month and start business on the same day. At that time, a type of exchange ticket will be issued, each ticket costs four cents. Upon entering the venue with the ticket, the ticket can be exchanged for goods. Its business policy will adopt a low-profit strategy, with a particular focus on promoting national goods. It is heard that the company originally planned to prepare refreshments on the opening day to thank the guests for their presence, but upon hearing that domestic hunger and drowning have become increasingly frequent, and disaster victims are in urgent need of help, it has saved the cost of this refreshment and smoke, and transferred it to disaster relief, as a way to bring blessings to guests from all walks of life. Turning uselessness into usefulness, the spirit of its operation can be seen at a glance, and the enthusiasm for disaster relief is even more gratifying and admirable.</p>
<h3>Change of Magen Road Warehouse, Free Storage Date: Arrival of Goods Changed from Seven Days to Five Days</h3>
<p>The free storage date for goods at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Magen Road Warehouse was previously changed to three days for departing goods and seven days for arriving goods. The storage fee for fourth-class and below is 1.5 cents per ton for a full carload and 5 cents for every 50 kilograms for less than a full carload. Now, with the approval of the Railway Bureau by the Vehicle Department, starting from January 1, 1936, the free storage date for goods arriving at the station will still be changed from seven days to five days.</p>
<h3>Under the Depressed Market, Sino-French Property Tax Dispute: Sino-French Asks to Reduce the Estimated Annual Rent, but the Municipal Council Fails to Understand</h3>
<p>The houses and foundations of the Sino-French Pharmacy on Beijing Road and Ni Cheng Bridge are all self-owned and were built in 1929. After the Municipal Council appraised them, the annual rent should be 20,140 yuan. The municipal general tax is collected based on this appraisal at 14%. In July 1933, the Municipal Council re-appraised it, increasing it to an annual rent of 33,566 yuan. However, the current market is extremely depressed, and property prices have plummeted as a result. Based on this reason, the Sino-French Pharmacy requested the Municipal Council to reduce the estimated annual rent to 27,781 yuan and 83 cents, so that the payment of the municipal general tax can also be calculated based on this. However, the Municipal Council refused the request and insisted on paying the municipal general tax according to the annual rent of 33,566 yuan, resulting in an irresolvable situation. For the autumn and winter tax payments last year, Sino-French paid according to the reduced amount requested, but the Municipal Council refused to accept it. On one hand, the Tax Department of the Council appointed Lawyer Ru Bao to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Xu Xiaochu, the manager of Sino-French Pharmacy, of owing the autumn and winter tax payments, totaling 2,349 yuan and 63 cents in national currency, requesting a judgment ordering payment and bearing the litigation costs. Sino-French also appointed Lawyer Chen Rui to file a defense and counterclaim, requesting permission to pay a quarterly tax of 972 yuan and 36 cents according to the annual rent of 27,781 yuan and 83 cents. The reasons are briefly stated that the Municipal Council initially assessed the annual rent of the Sino-French houses at 14,400 taels, and then suddenly increased it to 24,000 taels, because the Shanghai market was frequently described as developed at that time, and Sino-French especially requested an increase in installments. However, the situation has changed drastically today. Depressed phenomena permeate the city, houses are vacant, and real estate is unattended. The trend of rent reduction is raging, and the number of cases where rent is reduced through negotiation, court mediation, or judgment is unknown. The case of Aimu Yi Primary School and others are used as a ratio, and this kind of fact cannot be concealed. Furthermore, the frequent closure of silver money shops is mostly based on the fact that real estate is unattended. Therefore, the house prices in Shanghai are very different from the past. Therefore, the request of Sino-French to reduce the rent estimate cannot be said to be without reason, and so on. The case has been opened in the First Special Court by Judge Mo Runhua for trial, and the date for sentencing has been scheduled.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Surveying Bureau: Removal of Sunken Ship at Songkou; Movement of Navigation Marks in Tongzhou Waterway at the Same Time</h3>

<h3>The Zhan Dayou Ink Shop Property Dispute Case Has Not Yet Been Concluded: Cha Qilin Sues Zhan Yunshan and Others for Forgery of Documents; Trial Opened Yesterday; Adjourned for Retrial Due to the Absence of the Defendant</h3>
<p>The Zhan Dayou Ink Shop on Fangbang Road in this city is a century-old shop with assets of over two million gold yuan. The owner, Zhan Daosan from Anhui, died in 1929, and the dispute has continued for years without resolution. Daosan had no children, only one daughter, who married Cha Qilin, also from the same hometown. They have one son and two daughters. The son's name is Da (9 years old), and the daughters' names are Xingxian and Hongxian. (Cha Zhan died of illness in 1932.) Since Daosan's death,</p>
<p>The store affairs were entirely controlled by his paternal uncle, Zhan Songling. Last year, Zhan Yunshan and Zhan Songling, paternal uncles of Zhan Daosan, filed a lawsuit in the local court requesting a judgment ordering the paternal uncle Zhan Songling to hand over the account for inspection. The third trial resulted in a ruling ordering the handover. On the one hand, Cha Qilin petitioned the civil court of the local court to confirm the inheritance of the estate of his father-in-law, Zhan Daosan. Zhan Yunshan also submitted a will established by Zhan Daosan in 1929 and a succession certificate established in April 1925, stating that Daosan had no descendants and had established his second son, Bohua, as his heir. The trial result was a ruling that the property left by Daosan would be divided equally between Cha Qilin and Yunshan's second son, Bohua. Cha Qilin refused to accept this and appealed to the Jiangsu Higher Court. Recently, Cha Qilin collected evidence and, in October last year, reported to the prosecutor's office of the local court that Zhan Yunshan, Zhan Songling, and Ji committed</p>
<p>Forgery of documents,</p>
<p>Forging seals, and Zhan Jixian, Yu Ruizhi, and others committed forgery of documents and perjury. After several interrogations by Prosecutor Ru Xiu, and after retrieving the will and certificate of Zhan Daosan from the Jiangsu Higher Court, it was determined that Zhan Yunshan and others did have the criminal suspicion of forging documents and other crimes, and a public prosecution was filed according to law. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Criminal Judge Cai Dingcheng specially opened the Third Court for trial. The defendants Zhan Yunshan, Zhan Songling, Zhan Jixian, Yu Ruizhi, and others,</p>
<p>Did not report</p>
<p>Only Zhan Yunshan appointed Lawyer Peng Yuanxun as his agent to appear in court, stating that Zhan Yunshan had not arrived due to illness, and requesting an adjournment. Judge Cai approved this, and then told Lawyer Peng that the defendant must appear in court for the next hearing in order to conclude the case as soon as possible and avoid delaying the time. Lawyer Peng obeyed. Judge Cai then questioned the plaintiff, Cha Qilin, who stated that he was 32 years old, from Huizhou, residing on Guangqi Road, and was studying. He said, "You accused Zhan Yunshan of forging the will and succession certificate, etc., and they have now been sent to the Supreme Court. However, who is the first defendant?"</p>
<p>Who is the heir?</p>
<p>He replied, "It is his second son." "Question: According to the above, how many people signed?" He replied, "There are quite a few people who committed perjury." "Question: Who is Zhan Jixian?" He replied, "He is the defendant's uncle and brother." "Yu Ruizhi is the defendant's cousin." "Question: What are you accusing Zhan Songling of?" He replied, "Because the succession certificate falsely stated that Songling's son would also receive 2/10 of the inheritance. They colluded, so I also want to accuse him." After Judge Cai obtained this statement, he ordered them to retreat and await the date of the next hearing.</p>

<h3>A Sailboat Capsized in a Gale Outside Wusongkou; 17 People Fell into the Water; Only Two Survived</h3>
<p>A sailboat, Wang Jinfa, from Sanhe Port, Qidong, was sailing with passengers and cargo and other goods to the old Kou River near Chongming outside Wusongkou on the afternoon before yesterday, when it suddenly encountered a sea gale, which broke the mast, causing the boat to capsize. All 17 crew members and passengers fell into the water. At the time, only two crew members, Zhu Genjiang and Wang Lilang, were able to swim to nearby beaches because they were familiar with the water, escaping disaster. The remaining 15 passengers were not seen rising and all tragically drowned. It is heard that most of the drowned people were merchants from Qidong.</p>
<h3>Postal Worker Fraudulently Cashes Money Orders, Claiming It Was Due to His Mother's Funeral, He Took This Extreme Measure; Court Trial Concluded and Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Shao Ping, a native of Ningbo and a postal worker at the North Sichuan Road General Bureau, was found to have privately carved a seal and stamped it on receipts and money orders to fraudulently cash and use 120 yuan from six customers, including Lu Jiufeng, Zhang Zhenjiang, Lin Wenbing, Yao Zhuoqing, Lu Junyan, and Cheng Zhiqing, from money orders sent to Shanghai from Shiying and Suzhou between November and December last year. The case was discovered the day before yesterday by Zhang Guangkui, an inspector from the bureau, who reported it to the Postmaster, who telegraphed the Hongkou Police Station to send Detective Ding Shixiang to secretly arrest Shao and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu from the Municipal Council stated that the defendant said at the police station that the money orders from the six households were temporarily misappropriated, and five of them were sent back in succession, but the ten yuan sent from Suzhou by the Yao family had not been given. Currently, four customers have come to court to testify. The police station has filed a public prosecution according to Articles 320 and 321 of the Criminal Law and Article 31 of the Postal Law, requesting an investigation. The money orders and receipts were then presented for inspection. According to the customers Lu Jiufeng, Zhang Zhenjiang, and Wu, the wife of Cheng Zhiqing, all money orders, totaling 75 yuan, were sent by the defendant, and so on. Yao Zhuoqing stated that the ten yuan money order was sent to Shanghai by his son from Suzhou, but he had not received it. He only found out after his son came to Shanghai. Lin Wenbing and Lu Junyan have not arrived. According to the testimony of Inspector Zhang from the post office, it was verified that the defendant had been serving in the bureau for seven years and had misappropriated the money orders from the customers due to the death of his mother, and he could not maintain it, so he took this extreme measure, asking for consideration. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be returned to custody and scheduled sentencing for next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Road: A Youth Murdered – Six Stabs to the Back and Legs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, around 4 PM, in an open space on Mongolian Road in Zhabei, in front of the former Gengxin Stage (behind Sanxingli), a young man was suddenly attacked by thugs wielding sharp knives. He was repeatedly stabbed, covered in blood, and quickly became a bloody mess. Passersby heard cries for help and went to investigate, reporting the incident to the Mongolian Road police station. The police took the injured man to the station, but the assailants had already fled. Subsequently, the youth was sent to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road for treatment. The doctor examined him and found two stab wounds on his back and two on each of his left and right legs, totaling six wounds. He was immediately bandaged and underwent surgery. According to the youth, his name was Chen Xiaosanzi, 20 years old, from Funing, and he lived in a thatched shed behind the Datong Road, Zhonghua Xin Road bathhouse. He had an older brother. Today, he was ambushed and attacked near 100 Jiantou on Xinjiang Road by his enemies Xu Xiaolaohan, Li Er, and Li Zhengqing behind the Gengxin Stage. The reason for the attack was related to a loan dispute. The people who stabbed him with the knives were Xu Xiaolaohan and others. The injured man remains in the hospital, with the two back wounds being the most severe. The police station has dispatched detectives to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Pudong Chunjiang Road: Suspect Robbery – Forced Victim to Borrow Money After Robbery, Public Security Bureau Deems Case Suspicious</h3>
<p>The home of Sun Jingqiang, a Ningbo native who lives at 21 Chunjiangli, Chunjiang Road, Lujiazui, Pudong and works as a coppersmith at the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory, was suddenly visited by four robbers around 9 AM yesterday. Speaking in a Ningbo accent and wielding pistols, the robbers found only three or four women at home, as Sun was at work. The women were forced into a corner and forbidden to make any noise. The robbers stole a wallet from a drawer in the room, containing 14 yuan in banknotes. Not satisfied, the robbers forced Sun's wife to go to nearby Fuxing Butcher Shop to borrow 20 yuan and to Shenyu Nanhua Store to borrow 50 yuan, for a total of 84 yuan. They then fled in different directions. When Sun returned home in the evening and learned of the incident, he immediately reported it to the Pudong Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Director Zhang of the branch, considering the case to have suspicious elements, ordered Wang Shifu, the head of the investigation team, to investigate the truth and take appropriate action.</p>
<h3>### Mi Jingshen Sues Huang Xianyao for Defamation – Trial Held Yesterday at the Second Special Court, Huang Fails to Appear, Further Hearing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Huang Xianyao, the second son of the late wealthy merchant Huang Chu Jiu, after discovering that his father-in-law Zhou Songqing was holding 100,000 yuan of his assets, first filed a request for mediation in the local court, which was unsuccessful. Subsequently, in the Second Special Criminal Court, he filed a private suit against his father-in-law and his father-in-law for damaging bondholder claims. After the court ordered the original documents to be retrieved from the vault at the Guohua Bank, Zhou Songqing reported Huang Xianyao to the police station for forging documents. During the investigation, Huang claimed that the documents were forged by lawyer Mi Jingshen and Wu’s family. The police department initiated a public prosecution based on this, resulting in Huang being sentenced to one year in prison and being put on probation for two years. Since Mi and Wu had left Shanghai, they could not be summoned, and the trial was suspended. Subsequently, the private suit filed by the bondholders against Huang and Zhou for damaging bondholder claims was declared innocent based on the public prosecution verdict. Some of the bondholders, including Cheng Kefan, appealed the decision. Recently, Mi Jingshen, represented by lawyers Wang Shizong and Yin Shouguang, filed a private suit in the Second Special Court against Huang Xianyao for defamation. After one hearing, which was postponed due to the absence of both parties, the details were reported in the newspapers. Yesterday at noon, Judge Qiu Huan of the Second Special Court continued the hearing in Criminal Court Two. The plaintiff, Mi Jingshen, and his lawyers appeared in court. The defendant, Huang Xianyao, claimed illness and was represented by his lawyer, Zhang Ding. According to the plaintiff, he was 49 years old, from Hang County, and formerly a lawyer, residing at 45 Ziyuan Lane, Zaxinli. In the 22nd year [of the Republic], Huang Xianyao, accompanied by Wu Jia ..., came to him to entrust him with handling the lawsuit against his father-in-law, Zhou Songqing, for ... occupying his assets, claiming to have evidence. However, he did not provide it at the time. Later, Huang came with Tang Chunsheng, handed over the documents, and signed a letter of authorization. He then sought mediation in the local court, which was unsuccessful. Huang stopped coming and did not pay the litigation fees, so the case was put on hold and no formal lawsuit was filed. The plaintiff considered the 100,000 yuan documents to be significant, so he deposited them in a safe deposit box at the Guohua Bank. The judge asked why he didn't publish a notice in the newspaper to inform Huang Xianyao. He replied that publishing a notice costs money. The judge then asked if storing the documents in a safe deposit box didn't also cost money, why didn't he send them to his family? What purpose did it serve to keep them? He replied that Huang and his family were not on good terms, and he had not revoked his authorization. It was right for him to keep them on his behalf. However, Huang falsely accused him of conspiring to forge them, so he sued him for defamation. Mi's lawyer stated in court that the documents were stored in the bank under the joint seal of the plaintiff and lawyer Wu Chengyu. Mi also stated that regarding whether the documents identified by the Westerner from the police department were credible, Huang Xianyao's statements were contradictory. The plaintiff initially went to Wu Zhiping's law office to verify that the handwriting on the documents was genuine. The plaintiff's lawyer further stated that Huang Xianyao's statements and submissions in both the public and private lawsuits were highly relevant and requested that the case files be examined. The defendant's lawyer stated that the lawsuit concerned defamation and that the plaintiff should not involve extraneous matters to avoid disputes. Judge Qiu continued the questioning. Since the plaintiff, Mi Jingshen, had been prosecuted by the police department for forging documents, the court immediately ordered a bailiff to notify Judge Li Changnian, who was handling the public prosecution case, that Mi had arrived in court. Judge Li stated that the authority for the public prosecution case belonged to the police department and made no further comment. The court then ordered that the case be adjourned to the 15th to allow the defendant to appear, summon witnesses, and conduct further questioning before adjourning the court.</p>
<h3>Aviation Donation at Concession Dance Halls Still to Be Gladly Paid by Dancers</h3>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai office of the China Aviation Association collecting aviation donations at dance halls in the Public Concession, the method has been changed. The donations are no longer collected at the entrance but are added to the bill. The amount of the donation to be paid by the dancers at each dance hall is specified. According to the authorities of the Public Concession, the authorities have no objection to the collection of the aviation donation. However, the collection procedure should still be based on the principle that dancers voluntarily contribute and avoid any form of coercion. The collection of aviation donations at dance halls began in mid-August of last year. Prior to that, the Aviation Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department for support. The Public Works Department replied to the association on August 8, stating that it had no objection to the collection of aviation donations at dance halls in the Public Concession, but it must be stipulated that no coercive methods should be used and that dancers should be allowed to contribute voluntarily. The letter was signed by Mr. F. Perry, acting chief of the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Gang Case at Fangbang Bridge, Police Headquarters – Seven Robbers Sent to the Public Security Bureau, Main Culprit Still at Large</h3>
<p>The owner of Heng'anfang, Fangbang Bridge, in Ximen, a local named Lu Renzhuo, recently experienced a bloody robbery attempt. Fortunately, Li Xiaobao, the head of the detective team of the Ximen Public Security Bureau, had received a tip-off and laid an ambush around the area.

<h3>County Government Urges Fundraising for Flood Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Flood Relief Association is currently appealing for donations to the flood relief effort in the county. Only the County Party Headquarters and the Tangan Camp of the Property Management Office, along with the Kang Ji Min of the Fifth District Public Office, have sent in donations and submitted donation registers. Having received an urgent order from the provincial capital to raise funds immediately, the amount collected is still very small. It is far short of the 5,000-yuan quota. Therefore, a meeting was convened yesterday. After discussion of the proposal by Chairman Ye Zhendong, it was immediately resolved to compile a list of individuals and philanthropists to whom the county magistrate would send letters to solicit donations. The district chiefs were instructed to collect as much as possible and to submit the donations to the county government's accounting office for verification and transfer within half a month.</p>

Mr. Lin Bingyan, a wealthy merchant from Guangdong, known for his sense of justice and courage, has offered his accumulated savings to charity and donated 2,000 yuan to the association to help provide shelter and relief to the poor. His act of kindness is truly commendable.

<h3>Gangster Claims to Be a Military Commander - Extorts Maochang Cotton Cloth Store - Sent Four Letters, the Extortion Amount Gradually Reduced to Hundred Golds - Shi Songlin Was Arrested When Taking the Money, and the Remaining Gangsters Escaped</h3>
<p>Maochang Cotton Cloth Store at number 347 of Mingguo Road, west of Old North Gate in the French Concession, is solely owned by Ningbo native Shen Maochun (57 years old, residing at number 9 Deshengli, Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge). It has been established for a long time and its business is quite good. Two years ago, because of doing business with certain goods, someone threw a bomb as a warning. Before that, Shen had been kidnapped by bandits but escaped, and he had received threatening extortion letters. Recently, the store received four threatening letters from the Bandit Mountain Post Office on December 16th, 21st, 25th, and 27th of last year. The letters were written on official paper, stating that "First Army Commander Wen Ganglong" was raising military funds to strengthen his army. The letter claimed that the army's firearms and ammunition were well-stocked, but they lacked provisions and money. The letters were filled with absurd language. The first two letters demanded 500 yuan, the third halved it to 250 yuan, and the fourth reduced it to 100 yuan, demanding payment within a limited time and promising to send someone to collect it. If they refused to pay, the letter threatened to throw bombs within 24 hours. The envelopes of the four letters were ordinary, with "Commander Wen Ganglong" written on them and stamped with a seal, resembling an official document. The envelope also indicated the location as number 12 Daodeli, Beile Road, Wen Sealed etc. After receiving the letters, the store received more than ten phone calls from the gangsters, urging them to prepare the money and stating that someone would be sent with a receipt to collect it in person. The store reported the four letters to the French Concession police station, requesting an investigation. Detective Zhang Ziying, Qin Youyu, Tian Shiqing, detective Yin Baoke, and others were dispatched to investigate. They searched number 12 Daodeli, Beile Road, but found no one named Wen living there. After several days of investigation, they found nothing, so they sent detectives disguised as customers to wait inside Maochang Cotton Cloth Store. On February 2nd, at 4 PM, a middle-aged man went to Maochang Cotton Cloth Store, looking for the owner Shen Maochun, and presented a receipt for 100 yuan to collect the money. The detectives immediately arrested him and took him to the police station. The man confessed that his name was Shi Songlin, 30 years old, from Pudong, residing at number 200 Zhujiazhai, Chengdu Road, and that he had been entrusted by Wen Asan from Wenzhou to collect the money. The next day, the police station sent Shi to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. At that time, the police needed to apprehend the remaining accomplices, so they were unable to disclose the information. Now that the accomplices have fled and cannot be found, the case has been concluded by the police department. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special Court, accompanied by Clerk Wang Baoxun, came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Attorney Gu Shouxi of the police department presented the case and filed a public prosecution for the crime of extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law, also presenting the four threatening letters as evidence. Then, Qin Youyu, the detective in charge of the case, reported on the arrest and investigation process. Zhang Chuncai, the shop assistant and representative of the plaintiff Maochang Cotton Cloth Store, also testified about receiving the threatening letters and phone calls. When questioned, the defendant Shi Songlin testified that on the morning of the 2nd, he was drinking tea in the first floor tea house at number 143 Dajing Road, Jiu Mu Di when he met a Wenzhou native named Wen Asan. He told him that he was unemployed and asked him to help recommend a business. Wen then invited him to room 12 of the Ruiyu Hotel at number 30 Xiafei Road, where he met the so-called Commander Wen Ganglong. The two men told him that they had arranged to borrow money from Maochang Cotton Cloth Store, had agreed to borrow 100 yuan, and handed him a receipt, instructing him to collect the money. They also told him to tell Maochang Store that the Xieda Xiang and Baoda Xiang cloth stores in Xiaodongmen had already lent them large sums of money. He did not know the details and happily agreed to collect the money. He was arrested as soon as he arrived at Maochang Store and knew nothing about extortion and had not conspired with Wen, etc. After examining the testimony, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the 14th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Smoker's Roster to Be Completed by the End of the Month - New Licenses to Be Issued and Verified, More Than 3,000 People Sent for Rehabilitation, Investigation Work Still Actively Underway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau is compiling a roster of smokers, divided into three categories: *Poor People's License*, *Ordinary License*, and *Rehabilitation Poor People's License*. The *Ordinary License* and *Rehabilitation License* rosters will include eleven items: name, gender, age, origin, occupation, address, daily consumption, cause of addiction, license issue date, license number, and remarks. The *Rehabilitation* roster will include twelve items: name, gender, age, origin, occupation, address, smoking license number, daily consumption, date sent for rehabilitation, date of discharge from rehabilitation, name of rehabilitation hospital, and remarks. The roster is expected to be completed by the end of the month and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and submission to the Military Governor. The Public Security Bureau originally scheduled October 1 of last year as the start date for issuing smoking licenses. According to regulations, the deadline is March of this year.

Therefore, the license renewal and verification of smokers must wait until the smoker's roster is completed before a start date can be determined. Regarding the annual reduction plan, the person in charge of the Bureau said that it would not begin to be implemented until October of this year. As of yesterday (the 7th), New Voice News reporters learned from the bureau that a detailed count of those sent for rehabilitation totaled 3,367, with 2,874 discharged after rehabilitation, and approximately 890 still undergoing rehabilitation.

<h3>Shanghai National Goods Company Hosted Banquet Yesterday to Thank All Sectors for Assisting in Revival - To Open After Auction of Inventory Is Complete</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai National Goods Company suspended operations, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhang Shouyong, Zhu Ziqiao, Xue Dubi, Zhu Meixian, and others worked to revive it. They have succeeded. The auction of inventory to repay old debts and advance funds is scheduled to begin today. After the auction is completed, preparations will be made to reorganize and reopen. Yesterday evening at 7 PM, at the Hangzhou Restaurant, Wu Zhihao and Chen Zhongfu hosted a banquet to thank the gentlemen from all walks of life who had helped with the revival. Chu Huiseng, Xue Dubi, Xu Yongzuo, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Shenzhi, Wu Yaqin, Yu Hualong, and others, as well as more than 50 reporters from various newspapers, attended. It was decided to organize a National Goods Revival Committee to assist the Shanghai National Goods Company and other national goods enterprises. The gathering ended at 9 PM. The reports of Wu and Chen are recorded below: Wu Zhihao reported: "Today, Zhihao and Mr. Chen Zhongfu have respectfully invited you all to attend, for which we are extremely grateful. Today is for the revival of the national goods industry. Previously, we received the full assistance of all of you, which has given us a ray of hope for the revival of the national goods industry. However, given the United States' silver policy, the outflow of domestic silver, the extreme tightness of finance, the dumping of foreign goods, and the plummeting market prices of domestic goods, industry and commerce have been greatly affected, and the closure of factories is often heard of. Moreover, in recent years, both floods and droughts have frequently occurred, people have been displaced, production has decreased, and the general purchasing power has become weak. The Shanghai National Goods Company, in this environment, although striving hard, was ultimately unable to maintain itself, resulting in the suspension of operations. Now, thanks to the strong support of all sectors and the sympathy and understanding of all creditors, we have achieved mutual assistance. Zhihao is deeply grateful and it is clear that you are doing your utmost to support national goods. We hope that you will provide further assistance in the future. We plan to organize a National Goods Revival Committee to extend to other national goods enterprises, so that domestic production will develop daily and sales will spread globally. We also hope that the government will provide protection and incentives, so that the economy and construction can be stable and move forward." Chen Zhongfu reported: "Today, Zhongfu and Mr. Zhiyi are hosting you to discuss the revival of the national goods industry, for which we are honored. Zhongfu returned from the North and first founded the China Xiexing Thermos Factory. After a year of research, the products were of high quality and the prices were low, surpassing imported goods. Later, due to the impact of the war, the entire factory suffered heavy losses, which shows the difficulty of China's national goods industry. Today, Zhongfu relies on the great efforts of all of you to assist in the revival of the Shanghai National Goods Company, as well as on your economic and planned assistance. Although I am talented and inexperienced, I will follow in the footsteps of all of you and hope for the success of the National Goods Revival Committee, so that the Shanghai National Goods Company can reorganize, recruit new shares, and achieve revival. That is what I hope you will assist with."</p>

<h3>Chen Youming's Wife Runs Away</h3>
<p>Chen Youming, 34 years old from Nantong, residing at No. 14 Sande Lane, Jiaxing Road, Hongkou, deals in pigments and is from a comfortable family. Some years ago, Chen met a young woman named Zhuang Laosan (i.e., Chen Zhuang) in social circles. She is currently 24 years old and has a decent appearance. Chen was immediately captivated and deeply infatuated with her. They were deeply in love and soon rented a house in Sande Lane, living together as if they were husband and wife. However, Zhuang Laosan was fickle and unable to maintain marital fidelity. Soon, she relapsed and often stayed out late without returning. If Chen criticized her even slightly, she would start cursing, causing endless family disputes. Chen Youming, fearing that family scandals would be exposed, could only endure it in silence, even though he was extremely angry at the time. Who would have thought that Zhuang Laosan would not only fail to mend her ways but would instead change her former behavior, spending all day out, neglecting Chen and the family. On the 5th of this month, taking advantage of Chen's absence, she secretly returned to their residence, taking all the jewelry, clothes, 150 yuan in cash, and a savings deposit book from the Four Banks with a balance of 500 yuan, as well as a deposit book from Chen Zhengtai with a balance of 1,000 yuan, totaling over 2,000 yuan, and fled without a trace. When Chen returned home, he found the boxes and suitcases in the room overturned, with belongings scattered all over the floor. The person was long gone. After a fierce battle, he finally learned the whole story and immediately sent people to search everywhere, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news at all. Chen, having lost both his person and his property, was filled with grief and anger. He then reported to the relevant police authorities, requesting an investigation and declaring that he only wished for her to return. It is unknown whether she will return.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Rubber Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Edited by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(4) Product Classification</p>
<p>Except for Xie Kang Factory, most factories currently focus primarily on footwear, and some even specialize solely in galoshes. In addition to galoshes, some also manufacture rubber shoes, running shoes, leather balls, rollers, hot water bottles, toys, rubber hoses, rain shoes, sports shoes, machinery parts, or medical equipment, either producing one type or several types. However, Xie Kang is unique because its management consists of key members of the local rickshaw industry. Therefore, its only product is rickshaw tires. In recent years, the rubber industry has occupied an important position in national industry. However, there are too many players in the industry, and the market is declining, leading to inevitable overproduction. If businesses in this industry can shift their focus and change their direction, developing other products, it may be a way to turn things around.</p>
<p>(5) Production and Sales Conditions</p>
<p>Estimating the production volume of rubber products is quite difficult. It cannot be based on their value because market prices have been gradually declining in recent years. The rise and fall of value figures are not sufficient to represent true production volume. Furthermore, products other than footwear have different units of measurement and vary in size and shape, lacking precise statistics. Therefore, this article will focus on footwear, as footwear is the core of rubber products. In its heyday, the industry had a daily footwear production volume of over 80,000 pairs. In May and June of this year, it dropped to 8,000 pairs per day, a tenfold difference. In terms of sales, the Yangtze River basin is the main market, followed by North China and Southeast Asia. South China is difficult to penetrate because there are manufacturing plants in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Since June of this year, the industry has shown slight signs of recovery. By the end of July, most of the 32 out of 46 factories in the city that had stopped production had gradually resumed operations. Initially, it was because the central government's bandit suppression troops were gathering in Sichuan, creating a strong demand for running shoes. Subsequently, ball shoes became popular in Fujian, leading to a strong purchasing trend from Fujian merchants. In the past, the market had over 4 million pairs of shoes in stock. Recently, it has been less than half of that. The actual sales drive is the main reason, but the factories' tight finances and inability to stockpile inventory also play a role. Given China's large population and unlimited potential purchasing power, if the industry can be supported, strive for excellence, and find ways to increase tariffs on foreign goods to increase their costs, then the future of the rubber industry is by no means hopeless.

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>After the Early Vacation for Universities in Peiping</h3>
<p>Normal University to Study Education During Extraordinary Times; University Students Go to Various Places for Propaganda</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) Since the failure of the resumption of classes issue on the 4th in Peiping's education sector, the presidents of various schools have been preparing to start the vacation early. The students opposed both resuming classes and agreeing to an early winter vacation. However, since the early winter vacation and continuing the strike both meant no classes, although the names were different, the phenomenon of suspension of classes was the same. Therefore, the early winter vacation for various universities proceeded smoothly without any problems. However, schools that resumed classes, such as Peking University, saw constant disputes, and it is difficult to expect peace in the short term. During the vacation period, Normal University will study educational issues during extraordinary times, showing great potential for reforming education in North China. The Student Union and the work of various schools have not been interrupted due to the early vacation, and most are focusing on liaison and propaganda work. The situation in various areas is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Vacation Dates for Various Schools: Peiping is the cultural center of China, and there are many universities. National Peking University and private Fu Jen Catholic University have resumed classes. After Peking University announced the resumption of classes on the 4th, bells continued to ring in various colleges for days, but few students attended classes. Private Fu Jen Catholic University, because it is managed by American Catholic personnel, has resumed classes today (7th) without any problems. The remaining universities have all started their vacations early. The vacation dates for the various universities are recorded as follows: National Peiping University, 10th; National Tsinghua University, 6th; National Normal University, 5th; Sino-French University, 4th; China College, 6th; Yenching University, 7th; Republic College, 7th; North China College, 7th.</p>
<p>Jiang Menglin Discusses Resuming Classes: When the reporter interviewed Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, he said that the school's persuasion of students to resume classes was for the sake of the nation and the race, as well as the future of all students. Since 1919, he has been in the vortex of numerous student movements. Based on the experience gained from each movement, student movements must come to an end at a certain point. Otherwise, the result will not be satisfactory. A long-term strike is not only unhelpful to the student movement, but can also affect the solidarity among the students of various schools. When the school began to resume classes on the 4th, many students wanted to attend classes, but they did not attend due to the obstruction of the Student Union's patrol team. Therefore, the school affairs meeting gave a warning to the students who served on the patrol team. It has now been decided that regardless of the resumption of classes in other schools, this school will continue to hold classes. As for the students' intention to elect representatives to request the school to revoke the warning given to the students, it is feared that it will be difficult to do so, because school orders cannot be changed in the morning and revoked in the evening. In short, I love the country, love the race, and also love passionate students, but I cannot bear to see even greater and more shameful events played out in the future, affecting the entire educational system in Peiping. Therefore, I hope that the students can resume classes and understand our painstaking efforts.</p>
<p>Propaganda Work in Various Schools: Tsinghua University's bicycle team arrived in Dezhou on New Year's Day and entered Boji Yiyuan for an examination. White spots were found on Ms. Wu Han's tonsils. The students believe it is diphtheria. The bacteria have now been taken from Ms. Wu's mouth and she is resting. The entire team has decided to wait until Ms. Wu is definitely out of danger before continuing to move forward. Fifty students from Yenching University are scheduled to gather in Qinghe on the 8th to give lectures in nearby villages. More than 20 members of the Peking University Medical College rescue team went to Gu'an on the morning of the 7th to treat and expand the propaganda team. The first and second groups of the Student Union propaganda team arrived in Liulihe on the 7th, and the third group went to Gu'an. The Northeast University propaganda team performed patriotic dramas at the Longevity Temple yesterday. The plays were "The Tragedy of National Subjugation," "Killing the Enemy to Show Filial Piety," and "Street Night Scene." There were over a thousand peasant spectators. The police intervened, and the patrol team confronted them, holding on for a long time. The police left resentfully (7th).</p>
<h3>Statistics on National Vocational School Students: More in Liberal Arts than in Practical Sciences</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The Ministry of Education's statistics on the number of students enrolled in vocational schools and above across the country in 1933 are as follows: 14,233 in practical categories, including science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine; 28,783 in liberal arts categories, including literature, law, and education; and a total of 42,916.</p>
<h3>Temple Property Dispute for Education Ends</h3>
<p>Temple Properties Already Allocated for Education Expenses Must Not Be Retrieved</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of using temple properties to promote education and protecting temples, disputes have frequently occurred in various regions. With submissions from various parties and the government's decision on the measures, this matter can be considered settled. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition from Provincial Commissioners: Commissioners of Education from Jiangsu Province, Zhou Fohai; Shandong Province, He Siyuan; Anhui Province, Yang Lian; Zhejiang Province, Xu Shaodi; Hubei Province, Cheng Qibao; Hunan Province, Zhu Jingnong; Henan Province, Li Jingzhai, and others jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education, stating that in the initial stages of promoting education in various provinces, there was often a shortage of funds. Organizers would often allocate local temple properties to cover the recurring expenses of schools, or use the buildings as schoolhouses, which were then submitted to local governments for approval and record. For decades, there were no issues, and the education system relied on this support. Using temple properties for education has a deep and long-standing history, and it should be firmly protected without any doubt. In recent years, temples in various regions have often used the "Supervision of Temples Regulations" or the individual "Management of Temples Regulations" of various provinces, misinterpreting and distorting the clauses, to litigate the already allocated temple properties, hoping to overturn the case. Some cunning individuals even take advantage of the opportunity to fuel the situation, even going so far as to transfer temple properties that have been administratively decided to be allocated to educational purposes to judicial resolution, ultimately overturning the original case. There are many such examples. If such a situation is not quickly prevented and properly remedied, the local education system will face a situation where funding is cut off or there is no school building, leading to stagnation and inability to maintain operations. This will not only cause disputes but also endanger the foundation of the schools, which will have a significant impact on the future of education. Commissioners, learning from past mistakes, find it difficult to remain silent and offer their humble opinions to the Ministry. According to the principles of laws not being retroactive, the issuance of the "Supervision of Temples Regulations" aims to supervise temples and their properties so that future dispositions have something to follow. It is thought that this regulation should not be used to standardize the properties that have already been disposed of, so as not to cause disturbances. This is in terms of laws. As for the temple properties that have already been decided to be allocated to educational purposes, they should be effectively protected. Various temple properties that have been decided to be allocated to educational purposes are related to designated uses and should be continuously maintained and not changed. If facts are disregarded and overturned at will, the established career cannot be handled, and it also greatly contradicts the country's intention to protect education. This is in terms of facts. Regarding the temple properties that have already been decided to be allocated to educational purposes, they should be effectively protected. For these two reasons, it is proposed that the Ministry forward the petition to the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all provinces that all schools that have already been established and have a record of using temple properties should be maintained as usual and not be disrupted. From now on, temple properties must still abide by laws and regulations and not be disposed of without authorization so that protecting temple properties can still imply the intention of safeguarding education. The future of education truly relies on this. Furthermore, the Commissioners would like to add that, at a time when the national compulsory education is beginning to be implemented, the central government has deeply understood the difficulties of the people, raised substantial funds, and provided separate subsidies. Local governments should also do more to solicit donations so that the great plan of compulsory education can be achieved as soon as possible. However, looking at the current social and economic situation, numerous exorbitant taxes and levies must be abolished, and the people's financial strength is unable to bear the burden. For now, the property of temples in various places can be used to provide assistance. It is proposed that from the 24th year, the provisions of Articles 5 and 8 of the "Supervision of Temples Regulations" should be strictly enforced for registration and periodic reporting. Also, in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, with reference to Article 5 of the "Regulations on Buddhist Temples Engaging in Public Welfare Charitable Undertakings," a specific amount of public welfare undertakings should be set based on the circumstances of the temples in various regions and the amount of property. During the implementation of compulsory education, these public welfare undertakings should be temporarily transferred to short-term primary schools or other local education projects so that the people's burden can be reduced and the progress of compulsory education can be assisted.</p>
<p>Opinion of the Ministry of Education: The Ministry of Education forwarded the situation to the Executive Yuan, stating that assets allocated for educational purposes should not be repossessed, as this would cause disputes and hinder education. From now on, the development of local public welfare undertakings should focus on education, which is appropriate. It is proposed that the Executive Yuan order all provincial and municipal governments that all temple properties that had been allocated for educational expenses before the promulgation and implementation of the "Supervision of Temples Regulations" should be maintained as before. After the implementation of the "Supervision of Temples Regulations," all temples should fulfill the registration requirements in accordance with Article 5 of the regulations. The expenses for engaging in public welfare undertakings in accordance with Article 10 of the same regulations should also focus on the expansion of local education. The proposals are appropriate in terms of law and reason. It is hoped that they will be examined and implemented.</p>
<p>Instruction from the Executive Yuan: The Executive Yuan instructed all provincial and municipal governments that the temple properties that had been disposed of by the provincial and municipal governments before the promulgation and implementation of the "Supervision of Temples Regulations" should maintain the status quo. The National Government had previously issued Order No. 400 on August 1931. Temple properties that had been allocated for educational expenses before the promulgation and implementation of the regulations should be maintained as before. The Ministry of Interior should promptly arrange for the implementation of temple registration in accordance with Article 5 of the "Supervision of Temples Regulations." The expenses for temples to engage in public welfare undertakings should focus on the expansion of local education. The "Regulations on Buddhist Temples Engaging in Charitable Public Welfare Undertakings" had previously been submitted by the Ministry of Interior to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing, and circulated to all provincial and municipal governments. In accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1, of the regulations, which stipulates that original educational undertakings should be carried out for the people, there is no inconsistency with the original proposal. All provinces and cities should earnestly carry out the regulations.</p>
<p>Recent Developments in Provinces and Cities: After receiving the instructions from the Executive Yuan, the provincial governments have issued orders to all counties in the province to comply with the instructions and forward them to their subordinates for compliance.</p>

In addition to the Ministry awarding a first-class certificate of merit, a special case should be submitted to be commended by order of the state. Chen Kuan has generously donated money and benefited scholars, which is a truly enthusiastic act of education. He should be commended by order of the state to encourage others.</p>

<h3>World Sports News Snippets</h3>
<p>World Marathon Runner Disqualified</p>
<p>Mr. Chapala, an athlete from the Republic of Argentina in South America, was the winner of the Aring Beck Marathon. After the last Rocky Mountain Games, a bronze statue of Mr. Chapala was built, which can be said to be the highest honor. Mr. Chapala is the personal secretary of the President of Argentina. Due to his participation in the competition, he was granted a year's leave to go to Berlin first, and then to work as an assistant in a pediatric hospital. He is only 24 years old, goes to bed before 9 pm every night, and gets up before 7 am, which is the norm of his daily life. In the morning, he practices gymnastics in the gym, and in the afternoon, he practices light 8,000 to 10,000 meters on the marathon track of the World Games. He once said the bold words, "No one can break his record in four years."</p>
<p>There is no problem for Mr. Chapala to win the championship in this competition. However, the International Amateur Athletic Federation has issued a notice stating that Mr. Chapala is already a member of a professional sports club and should immediately be suspended from his amateur competition qualification. Such a talent, now loses his amateur qualification, which is a pity.</p>
<p>The Frost Queen of Women's Gymnastics</p>
<p>Miss Tuella, a women's gymnastics athlete who will dominate the 11th World Games in Berlin, is also the winner of the last Games. Miss Tuella is American and has recently made special progress. Miss Tuella's unique skill of standing independently on the parallel bars with one hand is also not easy for ordinary men to learn. In our country, where gymnastics is still in its infancy, should we be shocked by Ms. Tuella?</p>
<p>The Japanese Yomiuri Giants Baseball Team Goes to the United States for the Second Time</p>
<p>The Yomiuri Giants baseball team, a professional baseball team in Japan, is the strongest in the Japanese baseball world. It has been to the United States once before. After returning to China, it fought in the mainland again. Its technical progress is no longer what it used to be. This is of great merit to the improvement of Japanese baseball technology in general. In order to explore the highest technology of the United States, the team decided to embark on a long expedition again this spring. It is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on February 14, travel through Hawaii to the United States, and return to Yokohama on June 5 after the game. Therefore, Mr. Yade Lu, the consultant of the Yomiuri Giants, is working hard to study the special practice method of batting, and plans to start winter practice a month earlier, preparing to dominate the United States in the future, and return with the honor of being praised by Americans as "Japanese baseball is successful". The bold words can be said to be arrogant. It is heard that the team's coach, Tadao Ichioka, said that there will be 70 games in the United States for two and a half months, and he expects a satisfactory harvest.</p>
<p>The Leap Forward of New Track and Field Records in 1935</p>
<p>In 1935, the creators of new world track and field records collected totaled 26 events for men, with 29 new records and 12 equal records; for women, there were 4 events, with 13 new records and 3 equal records. These numerous records will be reviewed and recognized by the General Assembly of the International Amateur Athletic Federation this summer. For example,</p>
<p>The pole vault achievement is 4 meters and 40 centimeters (created by Glabaud), which is 3 inches higher than the original record on average, so there should be no objection to the review and recognition. Furthermore, the 100-meter record, which is eye-catching, is 10.2 seconds, the long jump is 8.12 meters, the shot put is 18.89 meters, the discus is 53.10 meters, the women's 100 meters is 11.6 seconds, the 200 meters is 23.2 seconds, and the discus is 47.14 meters. These excellent records cannot be said to be the ultimate human skills. This proves that the advancement of human special skills will be endless. (The rest of the items are omitted because there are too many)</p>
<p>The Problem of Male Female Athletes</p>
<p>Ms. "Aria Agoi", the world record holder for the women's 800 meters, has recently undergone surgery by a doctor, who said that she is a woman disguised as a man. This is indeed a strange story in the sports world. Those who possess both male and female external characteristics are medically known as hermaphrodites. Her surgery only sees the strengthening of men and no female appearance, then Aria Agoi is the reduction of a man. If her record exceeds the female standard and reaches the male standard, it can further prove her physical deformity. Furthermore, the new women's world records this year, the 47.14 meters in the discus by German Woman Mua Lu Man Yie, and the 11.6 seconds in the 100 meters by American Stocksfin, are only 17 years old, and have a great physique of 5 feet 11 inches in height and 150 pounds in weight, which is indeed a strange sight of young female athletes, how can it not make people suspect the truth? Moreover, the previous holder of the 800-meter record was a mother who had given birth to two children, which is rare. Also, such as the Polish athlete Conala Kojukihar, who once held the women's discus world record, has always had a super-female road that shines in the world, all of which can be said to be sexually different from Aria Agoi's first-class. However, the current interesting question is, should Aria's 800-meter record be preserved, or what? This is of course not necessary to discuss, the reporter said that it is a pity for Aria not to have a precious later life of female happiness. Ladies and gentlemen, are you all young girls like men? Hearing this, can you rest assured?</p>
<h3>The Amoy Table Tennis Team Wins Against Evening Glow</h3>

The Amoy team has the famous Chen Junjie, while the Evening Glow team is led by Captain Wang Zhongheng. The battle was very exciting. As a result, the Amoy team relied on the courage of its soldiers and defeated the opponent by a score of six to one. It is also reported that the Amoy team will have a friendly match against the Shen Bao Newspaper Table Tennis Team this Sunday. There will be a fierce battle at that time. Correspondence address: Wang Deshun, Shanghai Electric Power Company, Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>The Jardine Matheson and Walter Cups Are Postponed Again</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Small Ball Competition Association organized the Jardine Matheson Cup and Walter Cup competitions, which were originally scheduled to end the week before last. However, due to the continuous rain, the competition could not be started. Therefore, the two finals between Weiguang A and Lianghua B, and Huaxing Association and Flying Ball Team, have been postponed to today. However, the current venue is thawing, slippery and muddy. The association specially convened a meeting yesterday and decided to postpone these two finals to March 9. After the end, each team will receive the deposit.</p>
<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1) (4) (6)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Many comrades quite agreed with Ned's conjecture, however, Mr. Bhaer was still not bad; Ned perhaps would rather confess on the spot and get this matter over with quickly, because even the most severe beating from his father was better than the indifference, avoidance, and general suspicion he encountered everywhere now. Although he was here, he was as if exiled to a deserted place; strangely enough, although no one had raised a hand to him or said a word, he had suffered deeply this week, and the days felt extraordinarily long, as if they were unwilling to pass.</p>
<p>The worst part was here; if they had simply said it outright, or even beaten him severely, it would have been easier to bear than the silent distrust on everyone's faces. Even Mrs. Bhaer's face showed traces of that distrust, although her behavior was still almost as kind as before; as for the worried look in Uncle Bhaer's eyes, it pierced Ned's heart, as he loved his teacher very much, and knew that his unfortunate incident had completely disappointed him.</p>
<p>Only one person in the whole family still had complete trust in Ned, and no matter what the opinion of everyone else was, stood bravely on his side. This was little May. She could not explain why she could overcome all the signs and still believe in him, she only felt that she could not suspect him, and her passionate sympathy made her willing to defend him without hesitation. She did not want to hear people say he was not, no matter who said it, she had indeed beaten her dear brother John, when he wanted to make her believe that Ned must have done it, because no one else knew where the money was.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Broad Silver Strip Returns and Lengthens; The Standard Silver Price Falls by Three and a Half Yuan; There Is an Up-and-Down Fluctuation of Three Yuan in Half a Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw the broad silver strip fail to break the 20-pence mark as expected and instead returned and lengthened, causing people to lose confidence and turn to decline. However, in half a day, it was initially weak but then stabilized, with only a slight up-and-down fluctuation of three yuan. The market situation was extremely peaceful. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market saw London rise and the United States remain stable. The deferred silver price in Montreaux increased by about 1.25%, the exchange rate rose slightly, and London raw gold fell by another 1.5 pence. People's confidence was not boosted.

Although there was some hovering in the middle, the supply side was too strong, and it finally declined, once weakening. The HSBC Bank's listing was announced, with both the British pound and the US dollar remaining stable and then remaining stable. Later, the bank took the opportunity to buy at a low price, and the buying customers were also strong, gradually pulling up.

However, seeing the high price, the selling party was still eager, and there was still a small setback. The bank took the opportunity to buy at a low price, and it was rumored that a certain bank opened in cash, and the buying sentiment gradually increased and rose. However, at noon, the situation was still flat. The swap discount fell further to 6.5 yuan yesterday, and the number of chips was still more than 13,000, with the bulls exceeding the bears by 11. The half-day market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 1146.8 yuan, a drop of 3.1 yuan compared to the previous close. Lifeng, Huixiang, Qianyuan Yong, and Fuxing Yong sold off, dropping to 6.2 yuan.

The swap was posted by Yingfeng Heng to Mao Yong for 35 strips, at 7 yuan. Yingfeng Heng posted 14 strips to Yuanmao Yong, retreating to 6.5 yuan. Tongfeng Heng and Dafeng Heng posted 35 strips each to Yuanmao Yong, at 6.7 yuan. The situation tended to weaken. This was due to the poor source of spot goods, the shortening of the public bill date, and the combined interest rate.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Ancestral Shrine</p>
<p>Since the Wall Street stock market crash in September 1929, which induced a world economic panic, countries have successively abandoned the gold standard as a consistent means of saving the panic. Although there was resistance from the Gold Bloc countries, the state of their internal economic downturn seemed to prove that this trend was irreversible. Professor Cassel said, "The world economy cannot recover, which is due to the insistence of the Gold Bloc countries on the gold standard."</p>
<p>Abandoning the gold standard, in general terms, means inflation domestically and falling exchange rates externally. The purpose is to stimulate production and increase exports (Note 1). However, abandoning the gold standard does not necessarily mean inflating the currency immediately. If we try to examine the United Kingdom after 1931 and the United States after 1933, the number of issues is very stable, and there has been no rapid increase (Note 2). The reason is that in recent years, the departure of countries from the gold standard is different from the purpose of abandoning the gold standard during the war. During the war, the abandonment of the gold standard by various countries was for financial purposes, so it was necessary to inflate the currency (or it can be said to be its active attempt), while in recent years, the abandonment of the gold standard by various countries is intended to use the method of devaluing foreign exchange as an aid to increasing exports. The method of domestic support for industrial and commercial development is at most, and it is not necessary to increase the issuance.</p>
<p>If you want to devalue foreign exchange to achieve the purpose of increasing exports, you must also consider the relationship between domestic currency purchasing power and prices. In other words, you must make the purchasing power of domestic currency different at home and abroad to have the effect of promoting exports. In general, when a country devalues its foreign exchange, the purchasing power of its currency falls at home and abroad. At this time, the following three different forms may occur.</p>
<p>The decline in the purchasing power of domestic currency is smaller than the purchasing power abroad.</p>
<p>The decline in the purchasing power of domestic currency is equal to the purchasing power abroad.</p>
<p>The decline in the purchasing power of domestic currency is greater than the purchasing power abroad.</p>
<p>Among the above three situations, only in the first situation can the increase in exports be promoted, that is, devaluing foreign exchange. The decline in the purchasing power of domestic currency abroad (conversely, the increase in the purchasing power of other countries' currencies) is greater than the degree of decline in purchasing power at home. If it is the second situation, there will be no effect, and in the third situation, not only will it not promote exports, but it may expand the domestic market. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Both Discount Interest and Par Price Are Seeing a Small Recovery</p>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market was still sluggish, and the market situation was idle. The discount interest rate recovered by one point, and was eight points in the morning and afternoon. The discount bill transaction was more than 3.2 million in the morning transfer, more than 700,000 in new transactions, more than 200,000 in afternoon transactions, and more than 700,000 in small general association transactions. 1.3 million in banknotes were issued, and another 700,000 in other ports. The ocean mortgage transaction was redeemed for more than 1.6 million, and more than 2.8 million was newly made. Bank collection and remittance, foreign banks collected and remitted more than 3.8 million in bills, more than 3.2 million in various goods and exchange miscellaneous items, more than 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, and more than 700,000 in special exchange items. Chinese banks collected and remitted more than 2.6 million in bills, more than 3.9 million in various goods and exchange tax miscellaneous items, more than 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and more than 800,000 in special exchange items. Japanese banks collected and remitted more than 2.5 million in bills and more than 600,000 in special exchange items. Money shops collected and remitted more than 53 million in ocean public bills and more than 360,000 in ocean head bills, and more than 500,000 in various exchange items.

<h3>Securities: Bullish Support Weak, Public Bonds Decline Across the Board, Forward Market Prices Too Low, Arbitrage Impossible to Hedge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange experienced gradually weakening market conditions. Although Houses 4 and 11 continued to buy, sellers such as Houses 48, 75, and 78 were extremely active in selling. The bulls repeatedly tried to rally the market, but ultimately failed to gain traction. This was due to the sellers' composure and the overwhelming pressure on the bulls, who seemed unable to resist. The trend was extremely weak, and if Houses 4 and 11 stopped buying, there was a risk of a sharp decline. This was because the bulls' support was weak and the overall environment remained unfavorable. In the past two days, Houses 4 and others had bought approximately 15 million shares. Whether this was to cover short positions or establish new long positions remains to be investigated. With the Lunar New Year approaching, financial conditions were tightening, and arbitrageurs were unable to hedge due to the low forward market prices. If large positions were abandoned as a result, the outlook would be even less optimistic. Yesterday's four sessions generally trended downward. The market opened in the morning with House 69 selling heavily due to the rumors of troop reductions this month. Although these rumors were initially resisted, the market sentiment quickly dampened when the troop reductions were confirmed. Later, although House 4 and others bought, House 48's selling pressure was particularly strong, leading to declines of three to five jiao across the board. This further weakened the market in the second session. The salt tax for this month fell sharply by as much as seven and a half jiao. In the two afternoon sessions, market prices fluctuated slightly, with both gains and losses, but the overall trend was one of exhaustion. However, the fluctuations were relatively small. Market prices closed lower across the board, with declines ranging from two or three jiao to one yuan. The total trading volume was 24,785,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stocks Boosted by Court Ruling</p>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., the New York stock market rose yesterday (the 8th). Speculators believed that the ruling on the Agricultural Adjustment Act was a sign that the ruling on the Tennessee Valley Authority's power plant project would be unfavorable to the government. Therefore, utility stocks performed well. In addition, railroad companies sued the court, claiming that the retirement fund law was illegal, and railroad stocks also rose. As a result, the Dow Jones Railroad Average and the Utility Average both rose to their highest levels since 1934. Industrial stocks also rose in tandem. Among them, auto stocks rebounded, food stocks continued to rise, oil stocks rose slightly, and agricultural equipment stocks also recovered from their recent lows. The bond market was strong and active, and small exchange stocks were active and slightly higher. The total trading volume for the day was 3,080,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Shanghai Yarn and Cotton Hit After US Agricultural Act Ruling</h3>
<p>The yarn market trended weaker, with a sharp decline, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruling the Agricultural Adjustment Act unconstitutional. U.S. cotton was exposed, and world cotton and three-ply yarn declined universally, and people's morale was greatly damaged. Retail investors closed out positions, and Ming Wah bulls exited the market, and Shen Ji shorts added to positions, making it more difficult for the market to support itself. However, the bulls in the securities and financial sectors took no action. It is said that various yarn guilds, including Hunan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Sichuan, are successively purchasing.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Falls by About One Yuan</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning with a crack in American cotton, a serious situation, and panic, and most people's psychology tended to be low. Selling pressure was particularly strong in the market, and each month opened with a low bid. However, Kam Cheong and Cheung Fung bulls came in to drag the market up, and continued to add to positions, and the decline in market prices was not strong. After the second session, there was not much change. By the time the market closed, it was heard that the Changsha and Yunnan guilds were particularly eager to search for Chinese yarn, and those who profited covered their positions, and rebounded by several jiao. As a result, each month fell by eight or nine jiao to one yuan and one and a half jiao compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon market opened, and the three-ply yarn near-month rebounded after the fall, and people's morale was slightly stimulated and rose. However, when it came to the second session, it suddenly fell. Cheung Fung bought alone, and turned back up again. As a result, the near-month rose by two or three jiao compared to the morning closing price, which was flat in the far month. It was found that Tung Kee sold 700 bales, Ming Tak 350 bales, Ming Wah 1,700 bales, Shen Kee 1,950 bales, Shun Tai 350 bales, Yik Cheong 700 bales, Wing Tai 700 bales, Chun Tai 450 bales, Shen Cheong 350 bales, Tai Cheong 350 bales, Po Chun Yue Tai 1,450 bales, Kam Cheong 1,300 bales, Kang Fung 700 bales, Tung Fung 950 bales, Yan Fung 500 bales, Cheung Fung 2,550 bales, and Tung Wo 300 bales.

<p>Sales Are Still Down Despite Brisk Spot Sales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still not bad. It is found that various guilds bought a total of 2,600 bales throughout the day, and the price fell by five jiao to one yuan. The purchase amounts of various guilds are as follows.</p>
<p>The cotton market has fallen sharply, and the situation is serious. In fact, U.S. cotton, Liverpool cotton, and Indian cotton have all declined, and the futures of three-ply cotton have broken through the 60 yuan mark, and people's morale is greatly panicked, and the selling pressure is fierce. However, Tung Shing Company took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the market price was supported.</p>
<p>Ningbo Shorts Add to Positions</p>
<p>The standard flower market opened in the morning, with U.S. cotton falling 23 to 37 points, Indian cotton falling 3 rupees, and Liverpool cotton falling more than 20 points. Market sentiment was panicked, and selling pressure was even stronger. Ningbo shorts added to positions, and Shen Kee and Yun Hong also came to sell. However, Tai Foo, Cheung Wo, and Shun Shing covered their profits, and the market was still strong in the soft. As a result, each month fell by one and a half jiao to three and a half jiao compared to the closing price. The afternoon market opened, and the market was still sluggish. The decline in the second session was very strong. Following the decline of three-ply cotton below the 60 yuan mark, it returned to outside 60 yuan. Tai Foo and Cheung Wo continued to add to their positions, and the three closing sessions saw a rebound. As a result, this month rose by five points compared to the morning closing price, and the far month fell by five points to three jiao. It was found that Hop Hing sold 1,000 dan, Tung Kee 2,200 dan, Tai Fung 4,300 dan, Ming Tak 1,500 dan, Shen Kee 1,800 dan, Shen Kee 4,100 dan, Yun Hong 3,800 dan, Sung Yuen 1,000 dan, Wing Tai 1,500 dan, Yuen Hing Cheong 3,600 dan, Fook Yuen 2,800 dan, Shui Yuen 1,500 dan, Yan Fung 2,300 dan, and Tung Wo 2,200 dan.

<p>Spot cotton consumption is still ongoing, and Chinese and foreign yarn mills are still purchasing. 1,066 bales of Yao cotton and 390 bales of Tungchow cotton arrived at the wharf.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Greatly Affected by Court Ruling Falls More Than 20 Points to More Than 30 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened, and due to the interpretation of the High Court's ruling, it was favorable to sellers. The news from Liverpool was not good, and a large number of bulls closed out their positions. Foreign firms sold each month down 18 to 29 points. Then, a part of the short accounts covered their positions, and there was a slight rebound. The news from Washington was that the government had not yet determined a policy to deal with everything, and leading merchants believed that the court's ruling had nothing to do with the government's cotton hoarding. However, some people were still uneasy about it. In the end, foreign firms sold, and the market was again weak. Spot prices fell 35 points, and futures fell 25 to 36 points. It was also reported that after the cancellation of the processing tax, the cost of cloth was reduced, and consumption should greatly improve, so there were quite a few people who intended to buy. However, many people were afraid to take action, fearing that the area of cultivated land would increase, and also fearing that the 560,000 bales of cotton in the hands of farmers would be released, exceeding the limit. Some people believed that the ruling on the Agricultural Adjustment Act could predict that all the federal government's control measures for agricultural crops would be ruled illegal. However, the cotton owned by the government did not have the intention of being released as a result of the ruling. A large number of new control plans will be proposed in Congress, and the market is quite cautious and hesitant. Spot British cotton fell 6 points, and futures fell 18 points. Indian cotton futures merchants sold and bulls closed out their positions, and European exporters bought slightly. Ping Guo Er fell 1.75 rupees, Ohm La fell 2.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell 2.75 rupees. The original telegraph recording is on the left (telegraph on the 7th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi cotton on the 6th was 211 rupees, down 2.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Yarn Exchange Sets Stop Auctioning on the 21st</h3>

The names of the export destinations and the number of bales are as follows (unit: bales).</p>
<h3>Grain: New Wheat Flour Has Unique Rising Power, Wheat Market Is Quite Silent</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, the near-term sentiment in the morning market was that the big end was approaching, and customers and bulls closed out their positions one after another, so the opening price was loose and dropped to five points this month, down two points from the previous day. February, March, and April were also sluggish due to more selling than buying. However, the transaction of new flour in June was quite smooth, because the factory did not ship, and the buying atmosphere outside the industry was very smooth, so it still stood firm. When the afternoon market opened, the transaction turned clear, and the price presented a spiral, because the buying and selling were silent, it was very difficult to enter, and it was not easy to exit. As a result, January to April fell by one point, and the far-term was better by seven and a half li.</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, the market in each month was consistently silent after the opening of the upper and lower afternoons, because customers from other ports have not asked for a long time, and this port is also watching due to the settlement, so each session is mostly empty, and there is no vitality. The spot wheat market is also in a fixed situation, seeing that the transaction is not smooth, the price is similar to the previous day, opening Hebei and Jiangbei wheat at four yuan and nine jiao, Tiantai wheat at four yuan and seven jiao and a half, and Hankou wheat at four yuan and six jiao and a half, totaling 1,700 bales, which were handled by Fu Xing.</p>
<h3>Thin Rice Has a Strong Way Out of Guanwai, There Were More Than 4,000 Bales of Steamed Buns Yesterday, Passenger Xian Sales Are Weak and the Market is Loosening</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, a total of fifty or so sources arrived from various guilds (a total of ten thousand stones of goods, the sales market on this street turned dull, so the market was weak, and the price of thick early glutinous rice fell by one or two jiao. Four thousand or so bales of thin rice steamed buns were moved, and it was heard that most of them were going to Guanwai, so the market was able to stabilize, and the situation also showed signs of softening. Du Yangjian was flat and weak, and the Yin Change Yuan was still stable due to the scarcity of arrivals.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, there were forty-six or seven sources from various roads in Hexia, and the market's appetite for various goods was dull, the white glutinous rice shop was slack in intake, and the stockpilers took a little, and the price fell by one or two jiao. In addition to the early rice following a small jiao, the thin rice was moved and transformed in Tianjin, and the price was soft by several points. Bai Yuan's sales turned dull, and the price was soft by a small jiao. Yang Bu Jian's sales were also sluggish, and the price fell by nearly a jiao. The price of the other goods was also soft compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>(Passenger Xian) Yesterday, the arrival of various routes was still strong, especially the arrival of Jiangxi rice was more abundant, and the various routes in Xianghan Shashi and Eastern Zhejiang also continued to flow. However, the sales on this street suddenly became weak yesterday, and the total transaction was less than 3,000 bales. The market seemed to be gradually loosening. Immediately, a stockpiler entrusted Taifeng to buy, and the market slightly rebounded. However, the 2,000 bales of Gan rice, etc., that the stockpiler talked about have not been properly delivered, and the air on the market has already turned. If the current sales continue to be strong, the future market can be stabilized. Throughout the day, 1,560 bales of Gan rice, 300 bales of Xiang rice, 250 bales of Sha Han rice, and 543 bales of Wen Yong rice were sold, all of which were handled by this street.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined Red Sugar Opened at a Loose Angle Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat and soft. The association marked the spot price of No. 24 coarse sand white at 22 yuan and 5 jiao, and the local goods at 22 yuan and 6 jiao, both of which were transacted. Transshipment goods were called 7 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, up 5 points. Dong Chi had no ups and downs, Dong Bai called for a small 5 points to 1 jiao, No. 8 spot goods at 22 yuan and 05 points, transshipment 7 yuan and 1 jiao, No. 9 spot goods at 21 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, transshipment 6 yuan and 9 jiao, and there were few transactions.

<h3>North-South Goods: High-Grade Xinghua Orthodox Second-Grade Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Xinghua dried longan, the top high-grade orthodox second-grade, is recently scarce in stock, and the local price is also seeing frequent increases, so the Shanghai market has been increasing frequently. Yesterday, the high-grade market reached 131 yuan, up 78 yuan before and after. However, although the off-road goods are also tight, the increase is relatively small, because the sales are different.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Dongbai Iron Gets Worse and Worse</h3>
<p>The recent arrival of Dongbai iron is very abundant, but there is no demand because the year is coming to an end. The market is getting worse and worse because supply exceeds demand. The current market price of three-foot six-inch is estimated at 9 jiao and 23 points per sheet, and the price of three-foot seven-inch is estimated at 11 yuan and 2 jiao per sheet. It has been found that in recent days, in addition to door shop business and small-batch transactions, there has been no major buying and selling.</p>

<h3>Welcoming the "Citizens' National Goods Year"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Hope</p>
<p>Explore Overseas Markets and Promote Sales in Border Areas</p>
<p>Empty Talk Cannot Make Up for Practical Matters</p>
<p>The disastrous "Students' National Goods Year" has finally passed away very quickly. On the forward track of time, the five big characters "Citizens' National Goods Year" are being written. A new page can be added to the major events list of the national goods movement. The vision of the public must naturally be concentrated in this year, this year, this year, this year with a promising future!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the past national goods movement was a painful mystery. From the initial roaring "National Goods Year" and the two major national goods years of "Women" and "Students" to the "Citizens' National Goods Year," the achievements of these three years are undoubtedly bleak and dim in our current review. It is a case of doing more with less, but in the process of cutting through thorns and obstacles, we must not forget the people who have worked hard in the national goods movement. They buried their heads in hard work and actively carried out their work, and also laid the foundation for modern industry. In particular, in the past year, the reduction of imports and the gradual increase in exports have clearly told us that the enthusiastic national goods movement has gained great love and support among the broad social masses. At the same time, the improvement of foreign trade has given a bright path to the future of national goods. The implementation of the new monetary policy has given a major stimulus to the industry, which can determine the future trend of national goods development.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the prospect of the "Citizens' National Goods Year," I deeply feel that our future work should, on the one hand, be to determine concrete plans by the industry and strive to explore overseas markets and promote sales in border areas, penetrate into the interior, and, on the other hand, call on all people to abandon the psychology of worshiping foreign goods. You must know what time it is. The dumping of foreign goods has reached the point where it is about to swallow up the survival of our entire nation. Can we still have the delusion of material enjoyment? The recovery of the economic boom requires everyone to stand up and fulfill their responsibilities. History teaches us: "Empty talk is useless, and practical matters are important." We must now move from the theoretical to the practical stage.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my sincere hope that this year's achievements will be better than those of the past, and I deeply hope that the people of the whole country will have a deeper understanding and recognize the current economic crisis of our country. The national goods movement is a matter of the survival of the entire nation, so no matter what the banner is, whether it is "Women," "Students," or "Citizens," its development and growth must be backed by the strength of the masses of the whole country, unite as one, gradually implement cooperation among the same industry and cooperation between production and sales, and cooperation with the financial community, and move bravely towards the road to success.</p>
<h3>Advocating National Goods Must Start From "Me"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shi</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Ren Zhi once said, "To get others to do it, I do it first; to forbid others to do it, I don't do it first." These few words originally refer to all things. In simple terms, their meaning is "lead by example." If I want to make everyone love and use national goods, I cannot escape this principle: If you want to persuade people to love and use national goods, it is better to love and use them yourself first. If you want to persuade people not to buy foreign goods, it is better not to buy them yourself first. If everyone can do this, it can be achieved that everyone loves and uses national goods, and everyone does not buy foreign goods.</p>
<p>I have a good friend who has a very high position in society. One day, I saw him wearing a very new foreign tweed robe, so I said, "This piece of clothing must have been made several years ago. It is a pity to throw it away!" He honestly replied to me, "No, it was newly made." "Eh! That's strange! Isn't this contrary to your usual purpose of advocating national goods?" I solemnly asked him this way. He smiled and did not answer. I think similar facts are not unique to my friend. I am afraid that the world is full of them. Such advocacy of national goods that can be spoken but cannot be practiced is a hidden worry for the future of promoting national goods. Therefore, my intention is that from now on, advocating national goods should encourage everyone to start from "me."</p>
<p>Suppose I am a teacher: I should first set a good example myself. Everything I use, eat, and wear, whether it belongs to the public or is private, must be national goods, and I will be a model for the whole school. Over time, the whole school will definitely be assimilated. Otherwise, not only will the words not resonate, but even if you deceive the public for a while, the result will definitely be ineffective.</p>
<p>Suppose I am a businessman: I must understand that selling more national goods is to leave one more point of vitality for the country. For new national goods and national goods that can replace foreign goods, I should promote and introduce them as much as possible. If I only care about my own interests and sell foreign goods widely, or even change their appearance to deceive customers, this is the behavior of a traitorous merchant, not a patriotic merchant, so I say this.</p>
<p>Suppose I am a worker: For all construction materials and manufacturing raw materials, if there are national goods that can be used, I should use them as much as possible. For example, in recent years, workers have been greedy for the convenience of their work and have used foreign pine to build houses or make all kinds of utensils, resulting in the sales of domestic wood plummeting. All of this depends on the workers' advocacy to promote the awakening of the owners.</p>
<p>Suppose I am a farmer: I must eat the rice and wheat that I grow myself, and not eat foreign rice and foreign flour anymore. I must wear the local cloth that I weave myself, and not buy foreign yarn and foreign cloth anymore. I must use the national goods produced in my own country, and not use foreign oil, foreign lamps, and foreign fire anymore. If all the farmers in the country can do this, the countryside will no longer worry about bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Suppose I am a woman: I must clearly distinguish which of the daily necessities needed for clothing, food, housing, and transportation are national goods and which are foreign goods. I must adhere to the idea that only national goods will be used. Adding a foreign good to the family is a great shame for the family. Bringing some foreign goods as a daughter-in-law is not a virtuous daughter-in-law, and bringing some foreign goods as a daughter when marrying is not a virtuous daughter. If women all over the country can view it this way, the customers of national goods will have half of the people in the country.</p>
<p>The Women's National Goods Year and the Students' National Goods Year have become past relics. The Citizens' National Goods Year is the new opportunity for the future. From now on, all compatriots in the country must firmly embrace the determination to advocate national goods, starting from "me." I think the national goods of the 25th year will definitely be promoted throughout the country, the national economy will definitely develop slowly, and the future of the country will definitely be restored. I am willing to encourage myself with this, and I am more willing to fulfill my responsibility to encourage my brothers and children, my relatives and friends, and the public I interact with every day. Let's all stand up together! To overcome the difficulties of 1936 and to revitalize the Chinese nation, we must first start with "me" and advocate national goods.</p>
<h3>New Year's Cards</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Must foreign paper be used, can't domestic products be used?</p>
<p>During the New Year, the liveliest business I see is the small New Year's card, which seems to have encountered a prosperous period, occupying the first place among the products on the market! Don't you see that no matter which bookstore or printing house's glass cabinet is lined with many colorful cards? Humph! If you take a closer look, you will really be dazzled and unable to distinguish which one is the most appropriate and outstanding!</p>
<p>According to a friend of mine, "Although the sales of this kind of card are only once a year, the number of consumers, statistically speaking, is at least more than one million yuan. Isn't this a shocking thing?" I later asked him, "Then, what is the raw material used for this kind of card? Is it a domestic product or an imported product?" He was not in the foreign paper business, but he was very familiar with it, so he frowned and replied, "The paper for New Year's cards can only be suitable if it is thick and smooth. Domestically produced goods are not suitable, and only foreign paper can be used to fill the role. There is no other way. Moreover, the card must be printed with extremely beautiful colored paintings to be pleasing to the eye; therefore, for these two reasons, it is very difficult to make such a thing with domestic paper." I was shocked when I heard these words. New Year's cards are originally very subtle social items, especially the consumption of foreign exchange that only has one New Year a year has actually reached this level. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Therefore, I also thought that the loss of these New Year's cards is not only a pity for the cards themselves, but also for the addition of an envelope and half a postage stamp. In these few days, even if this large number of cards going back and forth is not counted, the number of cards nationwide is probably too big for me to write down. Young students sometimes write a few auspicious words of blessing, and if they are not careful, they feel that they are wrong and still stuff them into the paper pen. Even though they are bought with money, they really don't feel bad! The ridiculous thing is that the national calendar New Year once flew by the cards, and then when it comes to the lunar calendar, it has to come again. This is really too unconscious.</p>
<p>Alas! New Year's greetings? Perhaps it is an indispensable part of etiquette. However, I think it is still too late in this year; in the coming year, quickly come up with a very suitable domestic paper material to eliminate foreign goods and recover rights. Even if it is not as beautiful as foreign paper, you must know that New Year's cards are inherently hypocritical social items. As long as they can express some meaning, there is nothing of great importance? Taking a step back, no matter which generation, everything, can you still take care of New Year's cards during a serious national crisis? I remember that a few years ago, there was a peach-colored greeting card on a certain gentleman's desk. The content was very scarlet and bright, and it also wrote a line of "Happy new year." Next to it, he scribbled, "It's not that you are polite, but that you are shameless;" I didn't understand this reason at first, and the old man said, "The child is shameless and doesn't know that this year is the National Goods Year, so he committed this ugly thing;" This kind of lesson is really worth mentioning to give readers a look.</p>
<h3>Viewing Objects and Thinking of People Versus Viewing Objects and Thinking of Country</h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>The weather is cold, the year is ending! Another festive season! Exchanging gifts is a way to maintain friendships. What gifts should we give to our friends and relatives?</p>
<p>Home feels near, but people are far! What are my worries? Thinking of friends and relatives, let's give some domestic goods! If they like sports, then buy Warrior brand athletic shoes or a billiard cue, etc. If they like to read, then buy a Doctor brand fountain pen, domestic ink, and various practical and scholarly reference books, etc. If they love beauty, then gift Butterfly Cream, Samsung toothpaste, Chang'e cosmetics, Triangle brand soap, embroidered pillowcases, etc. For the elderly, gifts like Wuzhou cod liver oil, Sichuan white fungus, Xinghua longan, Hunan lotus seeds, red dates, etc. For children, gifts like Kang Yuan Canning Factory airplanes and various toys, airplane hats, children's storybooks, etc. Strive to make women, children, the old, and the young, view objects and think of people, view goods and think of the country (Note: authentic domestic goods), and be happy in the new year full of vitality!</p>
<p>When giving gifts, it's best to write cautionary words on the gifts, such as "This small gift is entirely domestic, please remember it well," or "Presenting a small gift of domestic goods, wishing you happiness!" or "Presenting local products, no imported goods are offered, please work hard to promote domestic goods," etc. I think everyone will view objects and think of people, view goods and think of the country, and there will definitely be unexpected gains!</p>
<h3>A Review of My Plans for the Year</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>I remember at the beginning of Student National Goods Year, I wrote an article for this publication called "Plans for Student National Goods Year." Now, with great difficulty, a year has passed, and the results achieved have not been fully realized, which makes me feel very ashamed. Now, I will make an end-of-year summary of what I have done for domestic goods this year.</p>
<p>Organized a National Goods Visiting Group: This year we visited the Longhua Cement Factory, Longzhang Paper Mill, Kunming Brewery, China Chemical Industry Society, Taikang Food Company, Central Mint, as well as small factories producing nails, bakelite, glass, shoelaces, etc. The impressions we received were quite good. When someone wanted to buy daily necessities, we tried our best to persuade them to use domestic goods instead. Although the effect was very small, our goal was to think from a small scale. If every student could mobilize together, the results would be very considerable. There are now a total of twenty-five members in the group, among whom Yu Bailu, Lu Xiangxian, Shen Chengzhao, and Liu Longshi have been the most diligent. They have worked hard to help me negotiate visiting work.</p>
<h3>For Whom Do We Toil?</h3>
<p>— Shi E</p>
<p>Second, published a wall newspaper discussing domestic goods: We originally planned to publish a mimeographed publication with the aim of discussing domestic goods and youth self-cultivation. One reason was that the effect was small, and the second reason was that it was too much trouble. We are all students, and our time and energy are very limited, so we only put out a wall newspaper, named "Weeds." President Yu Xinan and Vice President Yu Bailu are very serious in their work. Unfortunately, there were not many external contributions, so progress was very slow.</p>
<p>Third, established a National Goods Research Association: Our primary purpose in researching domestic goods is to investigate the manufacturing process of domestic goods. On the other hand, we also purchased books on the actual situation of national industry from the association. We have already purchased thirty or forty kinds. Every half month, we review the past work once. Linghu Zhao, Xian, and Ji Yu, who often write for this publication, are members. The association is currently divided into three departments: Investigation Department, General Affairs Department, and Accounting Department, which are headed by Lu Xiangxian and Shen Chengzhao.</p>
<p>The achievements of the past are like this. I think there are many things that can be done in the future. There are many setbacks encountered, and many students, although they know that domestic goods are in this state and that the Chinese people must make a determination, seem to think that buying foreign goods is a matter of glory in their personal lives. When it comes to Chinese stationery, they hurriedly shake their heads and say, "It won't work." Persuading him to buy domestic goods, as if he thought he was being deceived, such unreasonable people are really a big obstacle to the national goods movement! But in general, the students' mentality of using domestic goods has indeed increased a lot.</p>
<p>Time flies, and another year has passed. I heard that next year has been designated as Citizens' National Goods Year. I hope that students in cities and towns across the country will continue to take on our responsibilities!</p>

<h3>Hoping Everyone Will Do It</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Stop Following Trends, Don't Forget National Goods Year</p>
<p>Shanghai's Difficulties Not Yet Resolved, Patriotic Burden on All Shoulders</p>
<p>Congratulations! Congratulations! But wait! Where does the joy come from? According to common practice, whenever the new year starts, people who write articles always have to write a few auspicious words and words of hope. Today, the reporter cannot avoid following the custom and will also write a few words to congratulate and congratulate, at least to say a few words of hope. However, after thinking for a long time, I still haven't come up with anything. Staring blankly, I looked back on the past. I remember the day this publication was born in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, which was designated as National Goods Year. The twenty-third year of the Republic of China was designated as Women's National Goods Year. The twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China was designated as Student National Goods Year. "National Goods Year is set, the names are different, ask you what are the results? Scratching your head turns into nothing." Although this is a pessimistic remark from an old gentleman, we who participate in the movement cannot avoid feeling a little ashamed. However, many leaders of domestic goods factories always say that they can encourage everyone to make society more lively, tongue-tied and lips chapped, which can at least make unscrupulous merchants more timid, make fashionable young masters' minds clearer, and transform the hearts of modern ladies and young mistresses. Although we have seen millions of imports of cosmetics and millions of imports of stationery and instruments in recent years, the national goods movement does not seem to be very effective. However, thinking a step back, fortunately, everyone is promoting it, and the numbers are still smaller. Otherwise, I am afraid there would be tens of millions of dollars worth of imported goods, which would not be as much as these numbers. Therefore, only "doing" is the way to go in the world, only then is there a way out. National Goods Year must be done, Women's National Goods Year must also be done, Student National Goods Year must also be done. "Doing" is a great way of self-reliance. Being born as a Chinese, encountering such a bad environment, seeking survival in death, and finding life in desperation, everyone must "do" it.</p>
<p>This year is the fourth year of National Goods Year. Some are designated as Citizens' National Goods Year, some are designated as National National Goods Year, some say Inland National Goods Year, and some say Overseas National Goods Year. I say all are good. Citizens should use domestic goods, and inland compatriots, as well as overseas compatriots, all Chinese citizens should use domestic goods. We are all citizens, why distinguish between each other, why draw boundaries? However, don't forget the following five conditions:</p>
<p>We should concentrate our efforts and cooperate unanimously, and should not reduce our ability to do things with different purposes.</p>
<p>We should be sincere and work hard for the group and serve the public, and should not use the name to facilitate private plans.</p>
<p>We should strive to provide convenience and reduce the burden for the domestic goods industry, and should not cause unnecessary damage to the domestic goods industry or promoters of domestic goods, which would instead create disgust.</p>
<p>We should engage in this national goods movement with a spirit of sacrifice and a sense of obligation, and should not use this to collect money and disturb factories.</p>
<p>We should strive for the universality of the movement and the comprehensiveness of its effectiveness, and should not be fragmented and limited to one corner.</p>
<h3>Dear National Goods Factories</h3>
<p>This publication is now introducing domestic goods for selection by patriotic users everywhere. We plan to publish products from famous domestic goods factories in each industry on a periodic basis to facilitate publicity and demonstrate promotion. Please</p>
<p>Each factory should send its name, address, distribution point, product name, trademark, and price list at any time for compilation. Your intention is appreciated! Sincerely, Shenbao National Goods Special Issue Department</p>
<h3>Contributions to Paper Merchants in the Three Provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xuwo Sheng</p>
<p>In June of the twenty-fourth year, I was taking a summer vacation at the Xileng Butterfly Hotel. My old friend Qi Yusan told me that the paper merchants in the Hushui area had been affected to the point of being at the end of their rope and that a way had to be found to save them. I advocated cooperation between machine-made and handmade paper, but I saw that it did not become a reality and was just empty talk. By December, the Shenxin two newspapers published advertisements for paper merchants in the three provinces for a few days, and I thought of this big topic again. The first reason it probably didn't become a reality is that they only wanted the paper factories to buy raw materials, make paper, and then have the paper merchants sell it. This wishful thinking couldn't be realized. Wouldn't it be simpler for paper factories to buy wood pulp on credit, make paper, and sell it for money? Who would be willing to lend money to rural areas to buy raw materials? As far as I know, among the three provinces, Zhejiang produces the most decisive paper.</p>
<p>Although there are many paper-producing areas in Zhejiang, buying bamboo materials from them is always seen as a scarce commodity, because Shanghai materials are only available during the Xiaoman season. They have to prepare enough for a year's use. If they sell it to you, they will lose the raw materials for their own work, so it's no wonder. Calculating the cost, each use of 800-900 catties of green bamboo produces 100 catties of white bamboo silk, with labor costs of one yuan and seventy or eighty cents. The price of green bamboo is no more than half a yuan per 1,000 catties, plus the use of lime, totaling no more than two and a half yuan. They used to sell old-fashioned paper for four or five yuan per bundle, even though humans didn't want to use it. But when burned for ghosts, no one would criticize whether it was good or bad, so they relied on superstition to walk a dead end. Although the number of superstitious people is decreasing year by year, there are still people who want to buy it, because the ash of machine-made paper is black, not white, so it is said that ghosts don't want to use it. However, the superstitious people are dying year by year, and the remaining superstitious friends in the world are decreasing, so their sales are also decreasing year by year, only equal to zero. Zhejiang's paper is all yellow, only the Pucheng area in Jiangshan County, because it doesn't produce lime, has to buy it from afar. The price of lime is light, but the cost of transportation is heavy, so they don't use lime, but use the favorable weather and location to implement their natural bleaching project. Although it takes time, the cost is lower and the output is better, because they don't know how to make paper themselves, and rely on paper merchants from Jiangxi to buy it and make white paper. This method was probably taught by the Jiangxi people. However, in recent years, the sales of white paper have also been occupied by machine-made paper, so the people in the Pujiang area have also become unemployed. The Jiangxi people don't lend money to buy it, so no one makes it anymore. In a few years, it will definitely be like the rice milling industry. When the old hands die, it will be difficult to train a group of people to do it. I have carefully calculated that the cost of collecting materials in Pucheng, transporting them to Jiangshan, and transferring them to Hangzhou is at most three yuan per picul, and one picul of paper per three piculs is no more than nine yuan, totaling no more than 150 yuan per ton, which is cheaper than wood pulp.</p>

<h3>Domestic Goods News</h3>
<p>Wuzhou Guyuan Factory occupies a very important position in the domestic goods industry, so this sudden misfortune, the news came, people in the society are very concerned. Later, I learned that the main soap-making part of the factory was not affected, and that there were no obstacles in the pharmaceutical manufacturing work; because the pharmaceutical factory of Wuzhou Pharmacy has a total of three locations in this port, in addition to the Guyuan Factory, there are also the second and third factories located on Anhe Temple Road, which can continue to manufacture various products and supply them continuously without worrying about shortages. I think it can be restored to its former appearance in the shortest possible time, and it can be expanded even more perfectly than before.</p>

<h3>On Hu Shi's "Forty Self-Narrative"</h3>
<p>— Lin Yiping</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shi has been vigorously promoting "biographical literature" in the past year or two. He believes that biographical literature is an undeveloped field, and as long as this field is developed, the literary world will add a great light, and culture will have priceless treasures. Therefore, he painstakingly said:</p>
<p>"In the past ten years, because I deeply felt that China lacked biographical literature, I have been advising my older friends to write their autobiographies everywhere."</p>
<p>He advised Mr. Lin Changmin to write "Fifty Self-Narratives," "Unfortunately, he died in Guo Songling's battle less than half a year after celebrating his fiftieth birthday," advised Liang Qichao to write an "Autobiography," "No one expected that such a lively middle-aged writer would only live to be fifty years old!" Advised Liang Shiyi to write a "Self-Narration," and it also became his "dream." Then he advised Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Yuanji, Gao Mengdan, Chen Duxiu... etc., none of them made it. Finally, it seemed that he couldn't persuade them anymore, so our Dr. Hu, who has a "biography fever," in order to "add countable, readable, and credible biographies to our literature," and in order to "provide materials for historians and open up new paths for literature," in what he called "We threw out a few bricks and tiles, just hoping to attract many beautiful jade and gems," he did not hesitate to use his pen to write his "Forty Self-Narrative" for us.</p>
<p>According to the author himself, his "life in these forty years can be divided into three stages, before studying abroad is one stage. Seven years of studying abroad (1910-1917) is one stage. After going abroad (1917-1931) is one stage." But what we see is only the first stage he wrote.</p>
<p>The first chapter takes the form of a novel. Although the technique is not very mature, the author can write out the process of his parents' engagement, obtained from hearsay, without any scruples and purely objectively, which is unprecedented. We know that China is a country that has spread the seeds of old etiquette and teaching. Historically, let alone sons not being allowed to talk about their parents' secrets, even their parents' names are secretly taboo. Some people even resorted to force because others called their parents' names in front of them. But the author in this article actually treats his father - "Mr. Three," and his mother - "Feng Shundi," as the protagonists in a novel and writes about them casually, which shows that it is difficult for those who cannot see through the old etiquette and teaching to do this.</p>
<p>From the second chapter onwards, it is all in the form of self-narration. Starting from his birthday, he wrote until he passed the exam to study abroad. In the narration of these chapters, he can still sincerely rekindle the fire of his childhood heart, and draw a simple outline of his past experiences, the education he received, the pain he suffered, and all the processes of his ideological changes. But after careful review, there are several points that do not satisfy us?</p>
<p>First, the natural environment of his hometown is not mentioned at all: No matter how great a person is, the native land where he first lived has a great impact on his childhood. Since the author was born in the countryside - not living in Shanghai all his life, he should first write about the natural environment in which he lived at the beginning of his self-narration. But the author didn't mention a single word, which has to be said to be a small omission.</p>
<p>Second, it lacks literary flavor: The so-called biographical literature should use vivid brushstrokes and lively words to vividly describe one's past real life. If it is like the author's writing in "Nine Years of Hometown Education," it is really difficult for us to "praise it." Because what he wrote is too dry, too meaningless, we only feel that numbers such as "Guangxu...year...month" and "Western calendar...year" fill the pages, and we never think that we are reading "biographical literature." This kind of year-by-year and month-by-month writing may become good material in a hundred years, but we don't believe that such a work will open up new paths for literature.</p>
<p>Third, there are contradictions in some places in the narration: It is not wrong to use the method of recollection to write one's own self-narration, and to write forward in the order of one's age. It will also give readers a systematic concept. But the author should make his age clear when he is writing. For example, the author "in Shanghai" (page 130) has the confession of "a seventeen-year-old child...", and then there should not be the words "in me, a little child who has just turned fifteen..." Perhaps the author used the words "just turned" to mean "seventeen," but it is easy for readers to misunderstand that a person's age is getting smaller as they get older. In fact, it is not the readers' fault for misunderstanding, it is all because the author has unconscious contradictions in the narration.</p>
<p>Fourth, the improper use of supplementary methods: In an article of self-narration, when there is something that is not worth mentioning directly, but it must be explained to make the reader understand, it can be supplemented in parentheses. But the supplementary should be appropriate, so that people can understand. For example, the narration in "Nine Years of Hometown Education": "There were only two students in my fourth uncle's school, one was me, and the other was my fourth uncle's son, Sishu, who was a few years older than me. Sishu inherited Yu Shuang." (page 41) This paragraph has already said enough; but he doesn't mind saying: "The second sons of Xingwu's uncle, Zhenbo and Yushu, have no sons, my third brother inherited Yubo, and Shu brother inherited Yu Shuang." Isn't this adding unnecessary details and deliberately looking for nonsense? For example, "When my father died, my mother was only twenty-three years old. My father married Feng, and soon after the marriage, he was hit by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Rebellion, and died in the war in the second year of Tongzhi (1863)." (page 32) At first glance, it is thought that "Ms. Ma" in the previous paragraph is also his biological mother - Feng Shundi, and when we read "In the fifteenth year of Guangxu (1889), he was waiting for a position in Jiangsu, and his life was a little stable, so he remarried my mother," we can prove that the so-called Ms. Ma is not Feng Shundi, but his father's previous wife. Like here, since they have the same surname Feng, it should be added as a supplement, but the author doesn't add it.</p>
<p>Fifth, the exaggerated momentum is too strong: Writing a self-narration is to nakedly write about one's past real life. Of course, there is no need to hide one's goodness and promote one's evil, and make a false "confession," but at the same time, there is no need to exaggerate everything about oneself too much. For example, the author read a "Zizhi Tongjian" when he was young, and compiled a "Song of the Dynastic Emperors' Reign Titles" (page 74), and thought of himself as "the groundbreaking work of sorting out the national heritage." He published an article in vernacular Chinese in "Jingye Xunkan" and claimed to be "the earliest to promote" "the national language," which is inevitably praising himself too much!</p>
<p>In short, Hu Shi's paragraph of self-narration has had considerable success in some aspects. It can provide many good materials for future generations to make "Hu Shi's Chronology." If we truly stand on the literary position, he is a big failure. Because his self-narration is only "biography," not "biographical literature." I think that the Chinese literary world does not need biographical literature as much as Hu Shi said, even if it does, it is a work that reflects the entire society and the entire life with oneself as the unit, and Hu Shi's "Forty Self-Narrative," which is purely to praise oneself, is fundamentally unnecessary.</p>
<h3>National Self-Awareness Movement</h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Qichang published an article on the National Integrity Movement in the weekly essay column of Dagongbao on the 12th of this month. He believes that as long as the Chinese people have integrity, those who guard the land will guard the land, and those who are traitors will not be traitors, so the National Integrity Movement is a spiritual national defense movement.</p>
<p>This proposition is naturally reasonable. When imperialism intensifies its aggression, those who are engaged in cultural work among the oppressed nations should do spiritual self-defense movements. Otherwise, if the heart dies, a national suicide will occur, and there will be no way to do it.</p>
<p>But how to build national integrity? On this point, I disagree with Mr. Wu and stand in an opposite position. Because his method - adding integrity lessons in textbooks, taking the teachings of the past sages and worthies about "keeping integrity" and "dying for integrity" to talk about, is completely a backward, restoration method, and has no effect.</p>
<p>The reason why some people in the nation do "selling the country" and "betraying the country" is, from a conceptual point of view, because they do not have national self-awareness. This is a very obvious thing. Then, isn't the cultivation of national integrity in awakening national self-awareness?</p>
<p>Abstract integrity teachings are ineffective. And relying on the integrity teachings of the past sages and worthies is to create a feudal personality. This feudal personality is completely inapplicable to today. On the contrary, it is harmful to national integrity. Wasn't Zheng Xiaoxu willing to be a traitor to the nation because of the integrity teachings of the past sages and worthies?</p>
<p>Su Wu's Han festival and Wen Tianxiang's killing are naturally willing to have national significance. However, the reason why they did so was due to the idea of loyalty to the monarch and the idea of becoming benevolent. That is to say, their integrity is the result of concrete feudal ideas, and they have never been for integrity for integrity's sake. Then, the National Integrity Movement should be a National Self-Awareness Movement.</p>
<p>Thinking of methods without focusing on adapting to the times, but only knowing to worship the ancients, the result, in addition to promoting the restoration movement, will never be of any benefit to reality. Thinking of methods without focusing on promoting evolution, but only knowing to go backwards, it is bound to be ineffective and will inevitably be conquered by those whose culture is higher than ours. Isn't the inability of Chinese culture to resist aggression already shown in the past eighty or ninety years?</p>
<p>It is a pity that even today, the need for national self-awareness as a common front is not understood! China's current spiritual "national defense" is national self-awareness with opposition to imperialism as its content. That is to say, the Chinese nation should recognize itself - it is a nation in the world, what environment it is in now, what contradictions it has with imperialism, and how it can be liberated from oppression.</p>
<p>Knowledge is not only morality, but also power. Therefore, as long as the Chinese nation recognizes itself, China will not only have passive integrity members and martyrdom members, but also active revolutionaries and excellent members to complete the great work of national liberation.</p>
<p>However, it is impossible to succeed without thoroughly eliminating feudal ideas and nostalgic feelings to modernize and scientize our consciousness. Therefore, the National Self-Awareness Movement must inherit the spirit of the "May Fourth Movement," determine the past sages and worthies, and absorb as much progressive Western thought as possible - social centrism and its philosophy based on anti-individualism.</p>
<p>Only in this way can we connect our National Self-Awareness Movement with modern culture and scientific knowledge, and only in this way can we resist the aggression of civilized or new barbarism (imperialism).</p>
<p>Raise the banner of the National Self-Awareness Movement and confront imperialism!</p>
<h3>Introducing a Chinese Literature Reference Book</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>—Chronological Table of Chinese Literature—</p>
<p>Here, I don't want to waste time talking about other aspects of literature; however, at the very least, I can't help but raise a few questions for discussion here:</p>
<p>First, the difficulty of studying literature without reference books.</p>
<p>Second, the importance of literary reference books.</p>
<p>Third, an overview of recent literary reference books.</p>
<p>Literature is not just for appreciation, although this is opposed by friends of "art for art's sake"; however, literature ultimately cannot exist apart from its time. In other words, the creation of literature is absolutely rooted in specific contexts. Because of this reason, a writer's birth and death dates, historical background, and the time a work was created, as well as the writer's environment, all need to be clearly understood. Only then can we truly know, study, and understand the writer and the work.</p>
<p>But when it comes to a writer's life and historical background, at the very least, the issues of "time" and "place" arise. In what year was this writer born? In what year did they die? Where are they from? Where and when did they create a certain literary work? Of course, we don't study literature solely to investigate these dead facts. However, in order to understand the literature itself, we must first start with these things. Therefore, many people who study literature often abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, focusing on secondary objectives and forgetting the main goal. Why is this? It is because of the lack of literary reference books.</p>
<p>So, literary reference books, plainly speaking, are tools for studying literature. They can help you read books in many ways, and they can help you do research in many ways. In terms of time, you can save a lot of effort in flipping through books, borrowing books, checking, and copying. In terms of mental energy, you can also save a lot of brainpower in researching people's names, place names, and dates. So literary reference books are indeed very important.</p>
<p>Chinese literary reference books were very rare before the Qing Dynasty; they gradually became more numerous in the Qing Dynasty. In recent years, with the advancement of scientific methods and the emergence of talented editors, they have become even more developed. Among the important ones are:</p>
<p>Index to the Classics</p>
<p>Index to the Thirteen Classics</p>
<p>Rhyming Dictionary of Historical Surnames</p>
<p>Chronological Table of Major Chinese Events</p>
<p>Biographies of Famous People Throughout History</p>
<p>Chronological Table of Birth and Death Dates of Famous People Throughout History</p>
<p>Table of Geographic Changes Throughout History</p>
<p>Table of Official Positions Throughout History</p>
<p>Complete Atlas of Historical Geography</p>
<p>Combined Map of Chinese Historical Territories and Wars</p>
<p>Cí Tōng (Dictionary of Phrases)</p>
<p>Dictionary of Chinese Personal Names</p>
<p>Dictionary of Chinese Place Names, Ancient and Modern</p>
<p>Guide to Books</p>
<p>Abstracts of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries</p>
<p>These books can certainly be used as references for our reading. However, among them, many, due to their different natures and scopes, lack a systematic literary tool that encompasses everything concerning pure literature. Well, the book I want to introduce today is precisely this book, precisely the literary tool we need.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Is There Truly Effective Protection of Freedom of Speech?</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Freedom of speech has become a universal demand of the Chinese people today. Recognizing this, the National Government recently issued a nationwide order to effectively protect legitimate speech in order to promote the rule of law and respect public opinion. This phenomenon is extremely gratifying. However, is there truly effective protection of freedom of speech? Based on recent observations of speech, it has indeed been liberated considerably. We were happy that the speech community, which had been mired in dullness for so long, would gradually have hope of regaining freedom in the future. Unexpectedly, not long after the National Government issued the order to protect speech, an incident occurred in Wuxi in which the authorities suppressed speech. How unfortunate! According to a report from Wuxi on December 29th of last year, the Wuxi newspapers received an order from the Garrison Command prohibiting them from publishing news of student petition movements. The newspapers immediately convened an emergency meeting that evening. Because the news recently published by the Wuxi newspapers was mostly about student movements, if they were prohibited from publishing it, most of the space would inevitably be blank. In order to accept the order of the Garrison Command, all newspapers in Wuxi suspended publication for one day on the 28th and issued a statement to inform all sectors of society.</p>
<p>The minimum for protecting freedom of speech is to allow accurate speech and truthful news to be freely expressed without official interference. Freedom of speech is permitted by national law and is a right that the people should have. The authorities' recent monitoring of speech was originally an unavoidable measure under special circumstances. But now that the government has issued an order to protect freedom of speech, local authorities should abide by it. It is regrettable that Wuxi has actually prohibited newspapers from publishing news of student petition movements. Student movements are an expression of the people's patriotic sentiments. Publishing news of student movements is perfectly legitimate and does not violate the law. Why interfere? Does the authority think that students' patriotic actions are harmful, so they don't allow newspapers to publish them?</p>
<p>Originally, protecting freedom of speech cannot be achieved by a mere empty order. Without effective measures, speech cannot be protected. According to our view, if the authority sincerely wants to restore freedom of speech, it should first change its news policy. And the first step in changing the news policy should be to abolish the news censorship system. But in fact, this is probably impossible to do for a while. If there is no other way, then the Central Daily News should request that the party headquarters or the government agency in charge of news discuss a simple method with the speech community. Besides clearly stipulating a few strict restrictions, all kinds of accurate speech and truthful news should be allowed to be published in domestic newspapers. If even this cannot be done, then the government's order to effectively protect legitimate speech is just an empty check, and freedom of speech will never be protected.</p>
<p>Speech is an important tool for saving the country. If the people's speech is not free, it is tantamount to reducing the power to save the country. If the people have opinions about national affairs but cannot express them, and the people cannot know about national affairs, how can the government ask the people to go to the national crisis together in this state?</p>
<h3>The Unemployed</h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>November.</p>
<p>November in Jiangnan has no warmth, no kindness; it has coldness, no sympathy, and the early winter wind.</p>
<p>Tang Xi, whose left hand is infected with frostbite, has become even more haggard these days.</p>
<p>I remember it was summer when he couldn't find a job and thought of Shanghai again. He was no stranger to Shanghai. In 1932, he left Shanghai due to unemployment after the war. In 1933, he wandered to Hong Kong. In the first half of 1934 and 1935, he was in Guangzhou. Those two places were famous metropolises in the south, where he lived by exchanging his own strength. However, when the demon of unemployment followed him like a wind, he was finally knocked down again. He always wanted to get up, determined once, twice... In the end, he still couldn't get up and had to lie at the feet of the devil, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Gradually, the days became boring and long for him. To relieve his boredom, he often wandered on the street.</p>

<p>During this long period of wandering, one day, when he had just stepped into the Hongxing Tea House, he met Ou Jiande, whom he hadn't seen for a long time. — That fellow was known as the "Little Zhuge of Niulan," who had a little wisdom and was good at handling small events, but sometimes he would fail. The ratio of failure to success was about eight to two.</p>
<p>That day, the two of them spent most of the day talking.</p>
<p>When talking about the issue of employment, Tang Xi asked him for advice in the most sincere manner. This time, Little Zhuge did not give him a "so-and-so" secret plan, but solemnly said to him:</p>
<p>"Big Brother, people are not born to starve. If one road doesn't work, take another. Do you still remember that fellow Zhao Songchen? I heard recently that he was appointed as the shipping director of some shipping company. Since he was able to help you with a sum of travel expenses when you came here from Shanghai, I think if you ask him now, he probably won't 'reject you' at the 'door,' right?"</p>
<p>Moreover, he also solved the problem of the fare for him.</p>
<p>"The fare for the cabin (i.e., steerage) to Shanghai doesn't require much money. If you really want to go, you can ask Fatty Zheng of the Guangzhao Public Association for help."</p>
<p>When parting, he also said:</p>
<p>"Man proposes, God disposes. It's not a matter of waiting for things to happen; it's a matter of people finding things to do. Go ahead! Big Brother."</p>
<p>Tang Xi was so moved by Little Zhuge's plan for him that he almost shed tears. That night, he endured it, and under Fatty Zheng's stern scolding and teaching, he finally got eight snow-white silver dollars.</p>
<p>Although Fatty Zheng's temper was fierce, his heart was always righteous.</p>
<p>The second night. —</p>
<p>There wasn't a single person to see him off.</p>
<p>The luggage was also simple. There was only a blanket and a thin little quilt, as well as some daily necessities that were picked up from the grocery store.</p>
<p>He curled up in the corner, letting the Taikoo ship "Guangsheng" take him to Shanghai.</p>
<p>After a four-day journey, he, like an explorer who had found a rich source, cast one last glance at the sea before stepping onto his destination.</p>
<p>The first thing he did was to find a place to live. Needless to say, he visited "Le Yixuan" again. The people who lived there were never surprised by the addition of a new guest. (This association often allowed some poor wanderers to stay there out of regional camaraderie.) Only a few of the most senior mean ghosts there looked at him with suspicious eyes, while thinking suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Long time no see, you silly fellow. You wandered empty-handed for a few years, and now you've come back empty-handed?"</p>
<p>Tang Xi asked everyone about Zhao Songchen's news. Some people shook their heads in response; some sighed; some first let out a long sigh, but ultimately, the phrase "Old Zhao is not as good as before" was often on their lips.</p>
<p>It was hard to find Zhao Songchen's address. However, his repeated requests to see him were denied. Finally, because he pestered him too much, he was told to come the next day.</p>
<p>The next day, after Zhao Songchen declined with a barrage of excuses and gave him a little favor, he was still trapped in the quagmire of unemployment.</p>
<p>These days, his body could not withstand the cold, and his left hand swelled up because of the wind.</p>
<p>He couldn't be discouraged. Every day he constantly thought about overcoming the unlucky devil. But...</p>
<h3>Goddess</h3>
<p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!" The enemy's shouts were like angry waves in the sea. Gonggong jumped up and looked around. On one side was the sea, and on two sides were rocky walls. There was no way to escape. He shouted, "Followers, rise up!" preparing for a desperate struggle. (18)</p>
<h3>Year's End</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>The sun peered half its face over the horizon of the East River beach, filtering through the treetops, mountain peaks, and many gray and dilapidated roofs in the hazy morning mist.</p>
<p>The wind had not blown for three days, so this small Gongjia Fort lay in peace and silence. But the weather was very cold, and the nearby ponds were all frozen with thick ice. The old hen in the house squatted by the woodpile, clucking and clucking, afraid to go out, but the skinny black dog outside the door hid in the corner of the wall, shivering in the sun, too lazy to get up and move. The open space was quiet and deserted. The thick frost on the green pine branches sparkled brightly in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The New Year pig in the pen was perhaps not full last night, or was worried that its days of bloodshed had arrived, calling out "ho ho ho."</p>
<p>Fifth Uncle walked out of the gate with a weak hand holding a dry tobacco pipe, standing by the screen wall, looking across the old plum tree at the white, misty lake surface, which was also quiet, without a single sailboat.</p>
<p>He put the dry tobacco pipe into his toothless lips, took a few puffs, and wisps of white smoke disappeared in front of him, followed by more wisps. In the past, Fifth Uncle always took his dry tobacco pipe to the open space outside the door to bask in the sun every morning, and whenever neighbors greeted him, he would return their greetings with his usual smile: "Ah! The sun is so good today!" But today, his heart was weighed down by a cloud of sorrow.</p>
<p>There was no more fire in the dry tobacco pipe. He took a few puffs, only to hear strange squeaks. He tapped the pipe head a few times on the ground, shaking off the embers. He stroked his gray beard with his skinny hand, wiped away the clear snot that had congealed at the corner of his mouth, and coughed. A feeling of aging trembled within him, making him feel the sadness of old age and frailty!</p>
<p>He dragged his heavy footsteps, aimlessly walked to a yellow stone by the garbage pond and sat down, watching the clump of light bamboo leaves by the low wall being blown by the wind, shaking their heads. He remembered that the end of the year was near again. In previous years, at this time, people were busy preparing for the New Year: sweeping dust, making cakes, slaughtering pigs. But now the village was still quiet, with no sign of the New Year at all. Only the gloom on everyone's faces had grown thicker, and the worries had become heavier in people's hearts as the days passed by——</p>
<p>"Ah Wu, I've run three times already. This little bit of yours isn't even enough to pay for my footsteps. People are waiting to spend money for the New Year!" Then he slammed the table: "To be honest, I will definitely not let you off on New Year's Eve. You can run away, but you can't run away from the temple. If you don't have money on New Year's Eve, I will move things..." Yesterday, the white-eyed monk's ferocious face suddenly reappeared on Fifth Uncle's mind.</p>
<p>He thought: The debt I owe is not just to the white-eyed monk. There are also food and money, which increase by 10% interest for every month owed. If it is not paid off by the end of the year, the property will be confiscated. Although there is still a pig in my pen, the money from the pig's body was borrowed from the pig butcher Defu for food and can no longer be considered my own. Now there are only a few days left until New Year's Eve. Where can I find more than thirty dollars to pay off the debt? Pawn things? But there is nothing valuable in the house. Mortgage the property? Who would want it in this time of need? Besides, everyone is just as poor and doesn't have food to eat... He couldn't help but shudder at the thought of this, and laboriously raised his heavy and dim head, staring ahead. The faces of the debtors were all smiling miserably at him. Sometimes, he would also hear a series of "Hey! Hey! Hey!"</p>
<p>Terrible phantoms; he closed his eyelids, not having the courage to look, nor the courage to think.</p>
<p>"Dad, porridge is ready!" It wasn't until his daughter-in-law called him to eat sweet potato porridge that he was awakened from his fear and pain.</p>
<h3>In the Northern Wilderness</h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>In the gray and misty wilderness, a range of undulating peaks stretches along the east bank of the Ergun River. The forests, shrubs, and weeds that are swept by the cold, October winds of the northern wilderness are haggard, having lost their warmth, rich fragrance, and vibrant green luster. The mountains and fields are melancholic.</p>
<p>The deathly still earth is being dominated by the cold season. Occasionally, flying snowflakes fall on the towering mountain peaks, on the narrow plains, on the broad forests, and on the traveler's difficult road.</p>
<p>The mountains are layered on top of each other, so high, so long, and so winding. A rugged, sheep-like path formed of stones, sand, grass roots, tightly clasps the steep mountain walls and dense forests, as if some place cannot be reached. It unfolds stuffily. Whenever there is a clear day, carefree and thin white clouds wander in the sky, but the sunlight refuses to give the traveler a tranquil and pleasant smile, only illuminating the area far beyond the forest. Thus, the traveler's journey becomes a sleeping, unlit street in the night, a deep, dark, and difficult trench dug in the underground layer.</p>
<p>However, every day I trudge on such a path. But I am not tired of the hardships of wandering. A solitary smile creeps from time to time onto my long, clear, gaunt face.</p>
<p>Weary, my aged mood often reverts to the innocent realm of childhood: humming forgotten tunes. I am used to resting on the withered grass by the roadside, gazing at the unfinished road ahead, imagining vaguely. After a while, I look at the jumbled branches pressing above my head. The sky is obscured and far away, only revealing a blurred green outline. So I raise my head, widen my eyes, and part my slack lips, pointing sadly with my hand at the string of towering peaks lying in front of me, counting: one, two, three… After all, it's childish, and I feel it's meaningless, so I laugh foolishly. Hungry, I can shrink my head into the oily collar of my coat and pull out a piece of dry, hard, long, oval flatbread made of cornmeal from my luggage roll, swallowing it rudely. In a few minutes, my empty stomach is filled. I feel my muscles beginning to jump with life, full of the power of great survival. I forget that this is the cold season of October. I forget even more that the mountain wind is constantly attacking my body. I inadvertently take off the black, long-haired dog fur hat from my head, and my two eagle-like claws vigorously grab the itchy and long unkempt hair scattered on my neck. I furrow my brow. I bite my gray lower lip with my teeth. I don't know what I'm doing. I feel like I'm dreaming.</p>
<p>When I am awakened from that elusive and distant dream, my ears hear a kind of urgent and loud machine rubbing sound from across the mountain. The mountains and fields begin to shake uneasily. I suddenly stand up, put the small luggage roll that was placed at my feet on my shoulders, and then hurriedly and frantically, like a chased fawn, stagger straight up the steep mountain peak. Immediately, the shadow of the sun flashed on top of my head; my vision also extended clearly—distant mountains, distant trees, distant plains, distant villages... A train heading to Siberia, spewing thick black smoke, was circling around the mountains and speeding away.</p>
<p>Vaguely, my heart feels a chill, an emptiness.</p>

<p>Opening: (Consort Mei)</p>
<p>May the wind and rain be favorable for celebrating peace and prosperity. Emperor Ming of Tang, it is, I, a man of shallow virtue, loved a woman who could topple cities. The palace maids and concubines paled in comparison. Only, Consort Mei possessed unparalleled beauty and talent, her eyebrows like willow leaves, her hair like clouds. Her flower-like face and moon-like countenance were naturally beautiful. The romantic emperor favored her grace. They spent dawns and dusks together beneath the moon and flowers. Truly, their affection was as deep as the sea. Who knew that the Yang woman, skilled in concealing her deceit, was newly selected for her beautiful eyebrows to enter the palace to compete. Contending for the dragon's love, her heart was filled with jealousy. Her foxy charm could bewitch even the most honored. From then on, the sounds of flutes and drums in the other courtyard were boisterous, while within my courtyard, only desolation and loneliness filled the air. I yearned to see him, but his horse would not come. He loves the new, forgetting the old. Men have always been fickle. Before the autumn wind arises, the silk fan is discarded. How many beautiful women in the world have cried themselves heartbroken over this. Consort Mei, it is, alone, endlessly longing. Only the candle has a heart, following my tears until dawn. Before long, the barbarian rebels ascended the golden palace. All because of that hundred-charming, thousand-娇 Yang Guifei. A violent storm was brewing. The beautiful woman's soul was severed. Leaving behind, her fragrant bones were sadly buried in the Plum Blossom Grove.</p>

<p>Opening: (Three Smiles' Night Escape)</p>
<p>The day of Guanyin's birthday is a perfect time. Beautiful maids and handsome boys are getting married. My lady, I have long forsaken my homeland for you. Tonight is, You Ying should follow Xiao Shi. The beauty reluctantly agreed. She wanted to bid farewell to her wise mistress in the hall. Only fearing that it would be easy to enter but difficult to escape. One of them, wrote a poem on the wall with a flourish. One of them, expressed her heart with a piece of flower paper. They bowed to the sky and hurriedly left. Exiting the room, they exited the back enclosure gate. Anxious that, the dew might cause slipping in the deep night. Glad that, the moonlight was better than a book-carrying lantern. Alas, the small boat was not there. Qiu Gu was unable to walk quickly due to her bound feet. Only seeing, a small stream and a pavilion. They rested for a while in the pavilion. Looking across the river, a boat was moored. They called the boatman to hurry on their journey. In the cabin, they each poured out their hearts. Suddenly, they heard the boatman singing. Remotely remembering the past. When the customs were opened and the boat docked on Guantang Road. Suddenly, the sky was bright. Prime Minister Longting left early. Not seeing the boy come to thank him. He ordered people to search the garden. Seeing the door locked, knowing they had eloped. A poem on the wall, words on the table. Upon closer inspection, it was a poem by Tang Yin. The Prime Minister was furious at this moment. The old lady's tears were also streaming down. "Return my Qiu Xiang maid!" She shouted. She ordered a boat to pursue them relentlessly. Only when the pearl of Hepu is returned is one satisfied.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Movie Star Wang Renmei's Divorce</h3>
<p>Movie star Wang Renmei, since cohabitating with her lover, has been affectionate and loving beyond compare. Unexpectedly, her lover, wanting to develop his career but lacking capital, discussed it with a former classmate. The classmate had a habit of being alone, and spared no expense to buy a smile. Wang's lover wanted to meet with him or talk in detail, which could only happen at her love nest. At first, she was unwilling, but after a long time, she became accustomed to it, but absolutely did not have any improper thoughts. People in the flower business saw that he was honest and easy to deceive, and teased him, especially the famous flower Xiao Lin Daiyu, who was the most mischievous. The night before last, Wang's lover visited him at Xiao Lin Daiyu's place. After entering, the classmate had not yet arrived. Xiao Lin Daiyu saw him sitting blankly on the sofa. After entering, the classmate had not yet arrived. Xiao Lin Daiyu saw him sitting blankly on the sofa, and taking him by surprise, stole a kiss from him, and repeatedly called him "Mai Daling," and took the opportunity to sit on his lap. Wang's lover could not escape, and had no choice but to turn his head away, shifting his gaze elsewhere, turning his face to the doorway, just as Renmei stood smiling outside the door. Seeing her lover turn his face, she turned and ran away. Wang's lover was greatly alarmed, and hurriedly pushed Xiao Lin Daiyu to the ground, chasing her downstairs. Just then, his friend entered from outside, and they went upstairs together. That evening, Xiao Lin Daiyu and others deliberately got Wang's lover drunk. By the time he returned home, dawn was breaking. Wang Renmei had not yet slept. Wang wanted to question him, but unexpectedly, her lover actually pointed at Mei and called her Xiao Lin Daiyu, shouting "Sister Lin" incessantly. At this point, Renmei could no longer bear it, and became angry. It is said that Renmei and her lover divorced because of this incident. Another saying is that Renmei ran away the morning after publishing her lover's secrets. What the truth is will only be clear after the premiere of director Shi Dongshan of Xinhua Company's "Song of Everlasting Regret," as the above is a fragment of the plot of "Song of Everlasting Regret," and the so-called Renmei and her lover are also characters in the play, not the movie emperor Jin Yan.</p>
<h3>Hu Die's New Work After Her Wedding "The Peach Blossom After the Disaster"</h3>
<p>Two Good Films to be Released Tomorrow</p>
<h3>"Tears and Flowers" and "Records of Wrongful Deaths"</h3>
<p>Since the release of "Madame Butterfly," the name of Shirley Group's Xuenai has been known to almost everyone. Now, Ms. Xuenai is meeting movie fans again with a tragic mood in "Tears and Flowers" (Mary Burns Fugitive). A lonely woman, being hunted by detectives, coerced by bandits, and fought over by men, fleeing east and west, with no security from morning till night. The spiritual and physical pain can be said to have reached its peak. Ms. Xuenai's delicate performance in this film is even more outstanding. This film is scheduled to be released at the Grand Bright Cinema starting tomorrow (Friday).</p>
<p>"Records of Wrongful Deaths" (Steamboat Round The Bed), which will be premiered at the Guotai Theater tomorrow, is also a highly admirable film. Will Rogers, known as the master of humor in the United States, his films are welcomed everywhere, and the box office success is often above the films starring general female superstars. Since his death in a plane crash, movie fans have sighed in unison, and it is indeed a great loss in the film industry. This "Records of Wrongful Deaths" is his last posthumous work, using the most humorous way to perform a very tense story. I hope fans who love Rogers' art will not miss it.</p>
<h3>Cast of "Flowers and Grasses"</h3>
<p>"Flowers and Grasses" is a new sound film to be shot by Tianyi Company. The cast has been decided. According to director Gao Lihen, the female roles include newcomers Zhang Yi and the stout Wu Yin. The male roles, in addition to Tianyi's basic actors Zhang Zhenduo, Shen Ya Tou, and Xiao Zhengzhong, also include stage newcomer Leng Bo and newcomer Yao Ping. If there are no accidents, this neat lineup will not change.</p>
