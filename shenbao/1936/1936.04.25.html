<h3>廢約整軍和設防運動</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>從去年三月德國片面廢棄凡爾賽和的中的軍事條欵重整軍備以後奧匈保土等國都很羨慕頗想步德國後塵各自廢的整軍祇因國際關係複雜顧忌大多未敢採取斷然行動暫時忍着罷了今年三月德國又廢棄羅卡諾公約進兵萊茵區域於是奧匈保土遂不再忍耐起而效允其直接效法德國的有奧大利的恢復徵兵制和土耳其的恢復達達尼爾海峽的防務其尚不敢單獨廢約而表示希望修的的則有匈牙利保加利亞和希臘</p>
<p>奧國本是德意爭霸中歐所必爭的地方德國旣重整軍備進兵萊茵氣燄高張意國自然要嚴防它以迅雷不及掩耳的手段併吞奧國從而擴張其勢力於南歐故於德國進兵萊茵以後就在羅馬召集意奧匃三國會議討論怎樣增强三國集團的軍事實力以對付德國的對奧政策會議閉幕以後奧國國會就决議恢復徵兵制度所以它這種舉動至少有幾分是意國所策動的法國雖不願它重整軍備給小協的國以威脅但在欲挾意以制德的前提下也只得聽其自然法國旣不反對則小協的國當然也不堅决反對所以它的重整軍備在德意法三國間的矛盾沒有解除的時候可以很順利地和去年德國重整軍備同樣成爲「旣成事實」的</p>
<p>希土戰爭後的洛桑條約雖使土耳其恢復了一部份色佛爾和的中失去的土地但達達尼爾海峽的防務却依然不得恢復這是它所耿耿於心的事情本月十一日它以德國廢的整軍做口實照會希臘要求修改洛桑條約恢復達達尼爾海峽的防務同時並照會國聯要求把這件事情列入五月十一日國聯行政院會議的議程它的照會發出以後希臘就提出對案要求恢復勒姆諾斯米底里吉沃斯和薩糜斯的防務英國因爲要和意國互爭地中海的霸權牽制它在地中海東部的行動自然相對地願意接受土耳其的要求的蘇聯和土耳其的關係很好它以爲土耳其海峽設防一旦成功則無異替它在黑海邊上築起了一道防綫所以也表示同情可是土耳共却不待條的的修改而逕於十七日進兵海峽地帶了</p>
<p>匈牙利跟着奧國的廢的整軍也提出了修的整軍的要求可是馬上就遭小協的國的堅决反對而不獲成功這是因爲小協的國是從奧匈失地形成的奧匈同時恢復軍備會使它們感受到莫大的威脅所以不得不堅决反對保加利亞雖也希望修的整軍但還沒有正式提出</p>
<p>廢約整軍和設防不斷地發生着足使國際間的矛盾更加尖銳化而且德國在廢約整軍和設防之後又在準備要求恢復殖民地這種要求也是奧匈保土所共同需要的要實現這種要求會增加矛盾的尖銳化使促戰爭的爆發所以它們實行恢復殖民地的時候恐怕就是大戰爆發的日子</p>

<p>「各位同志·各位同胞、很久沒有和各位相見、所以今天特約各位在省黨部舉行總理紀念週、藉此機會和大家會晤、順便將自己的感想、向各位貢獻、在過去一年當中、無論是社會政治軍事、尤其是敎育方面、比較都有秩序、有條理、能够漸上正軌、得到極大的進步、各位同志在本地、或許不覺得你們自己進步之大、但外而來的人士、尤其是兄弟、從去春到川此次隔了半年、重到四川、將前的的情形比較起來、格外看得明白、我們一個人往往對於本身的事、看不明白、而旁人却十分清楚、四川最近的情形、亦此是如此、現在四川各方面、都有很大的進步、得到相當的效果、卽如社會的秩序、軍隊的紀律、一般教師和學生的精神體魄、都比前有很大的進步、這是兄弟所最快慰的一點、同時亦可以吿慰一般同志的、由此我們可以知道我們過去一年的努力、不是沒有價値、我們有一分努力、就有分成功、有一分精神、就有一分事業、只要我們能够振作精神、努力奮鬥、一定可以達到革命建國的目的、我們不進步、就要退步、如有進步、必可成功、四川這一年的進步、當然是四川政府當局、自劉主席以下各位同志努力的成續、同時敎育界各位先生、和一般黨負的努力、也有很大的關係、因為敎育界和黨部各位同志，是政府和人民之間的連絡者、如果黨部敎育界各位同志不努力、政府與人民便很難精誠團結、共同奮鬥、便不能得到現在這樣大的進步、由此我們更可以認識無論是個人社會、尤其是整個國家事業、惟有大家同心、羣策羣力來做、纔可以成功、同時負領導責任的人、更要知道、只須我們自己眞能振作精神、努力奮鬥、我們的子弟部屬或學生、以及社會上一般民衆、一定可以跟看奮發努力、由此不但各個人都可以成功事業、而且全家全校全社會、以至全國的幸福、都可由我們手裏造成、所以我們不以為個人的力量很小、雖努力也不相干、要知道道之流行、速於置郵、德風所播、無遠弗屆、所以個人的力量雖小、其影饗實在非常之大、極其所至、可以一人奮發而天下為雄、所以過去一年我們大家努力的功績、現在自己雖不覺得、將來一天一天繼績下去、便可以發揚光大、必有一日千里之勢、這是大家應當黽勉奮發、自强不息、繼續努力、始終一貫、完成各位的責任、</p>
<p>其次、關於兄弟對於四川的希望和四川同胞應盡的責任、去年已屢次向大家講明、今天不用多說、大概各位都已經知道、四川這個地方、天然是我們復興民族的惟一根據地、四川同胞重大的責任、就是在此、四川同胞將來永遠的光榮、也就是在此、我們的民族如此衰弱、國家如此危險、今後果能由我們四川領導起來、使得國家能整個的統一團結、使我們民族能够很快轉危為安、轉弱為强、將來四川人的功績和光榮、何等偉大、這種挽救國家復興民族的責任、本年全國四萬萬同胞、都要負擔、不過以四川一切的得天獨厚、尤其是以四川人之勤儉·聰明·有魄力·有精神、所以特別要為國家民族多負責任，纔不負天地父母和國家政府希望之殷、亦不愧為現代的國民、我們要怎樣纔可以負起救亡復興的責任、達到最後成功的目的、造成永久光榮的歷史呢、最要緊的、就是要有一個共同的目標、然後大家向此目標、區同努力、纔能團結精神、集中力量、達到成功的目的、現在我們全國國民努力的共同目標是什麼呢、當然是總理的三民主義、我們要造成富庶的國家、堅强的民族、要恢復我們固有的疆土、發揚歷史的光榮、惟有全國上下一心、共同努力、來實現三民主義、但是三民主義只是一個共同努力的目標、還是抽象的、我們如要達到這個目標、還要有一個明確的途徑、就是我們要完成革命、必須有一個進行的方針、和成功的基礎、然後我們一切的努力、纔能事半功倍、救亡復興的工作、纔能加速進展、儘早守成、我們四川過去一年中革命工作、是要勦滅赤匪、安定社會、今後更要進一步修明政治、努力建設、事業更要做得偉大、工作更要增加效率、所以不可不特別知道事業的基礎、努力的標凖、和實現主義的途徑、這個基礎是什麼、就是我們民族固有的道德、大家要認識、我們如要明白國家致富圖强的道理、就必先要知道國家紛亂貧弱的原因、這個原因在那裏、從根本上講起來、就是由於國民道德的墮落、一般人因為道德墮落、所以沒有精神、旣沒有精神、便成了無靈魂的軀殼、無生命的木偶、甚至為匪為盜、為漢奸、為烟鬼、成為無禮義鮮廉恥的禽獸、這種國民、根本不能做人、那裏還能救國、所以一個國家的國民道德旣然墮落、國家便紛亂貧弱、什麼外國人都要來侵略、現在外國人侵侮壓迫我們、並不是我們沒有槍砲、沒有軍隊、我們的槍砲和軍隊、是在太多、所以他們决不是欺我們沒有槍砲軍隊、而是欺負我們沒有使用槍砲的精神和道德、因為我們沒有精神道德、所以軍隊和槍砲愈多、他們侵略愈易、外國有了軍隊和槍砲、可以保國衛民、我們有了軍隊和槍砲、却反轉來禍國殃民、這是為什麼、就是我們中國一般軍人、不知道自己的　責、沒精神和道德、只知道自私自利、不顧國家的危亡、同胞的痛苦、各位要知道、我們中國在歷史上、何以從先我們祖先能够立國至五千年、而且當時强盛偉大、有加無已、就是因為我們中國人有一種最高尙最偉大的精神和道德、就是大公無私、損己利人、自個人的交際以至國際的往來、都是講仁愛、存忠厚、克己以愛人、薄來而厚往、尤其是在國家危難、同胞困苦的時候、一般人都能視死如歸、犧牲自己的一切、來救國救民、全不顧惜、惟其如此、所以我們的國家民族、能够綿延發達、有如此廣袤的疆土、絕大的民衆、與最高的道德文化、長久的光榮歷史、由此可知國家民族之興衰、全在精神道德之消長、道德精神的國量、實在强大無比、我們要救亡復興、惟有首先恢復我們固有的精神道德、而恢復精神道德、就在我們大家一轉念之間、只要我們的固有道德、眞能振興恢復轉來、使全國四萬萬同胞、皆能相互親愛、團結一致、必能自立自存、外國而且不敢不來敬愛我們、不久的將來、必可成功一個世界上頭等的强國、</p>
<p>剛才兄弟已經說明、我們救亡復興的根根本要務、在恢復固有的精神道德、但是道德兩個字、是很廣泛的、所以去年本黨五全大會、特別訂下黨員守則十二條、很具體很明確的指示出道德的標凖的內容、呌我們全黨黨員、首先來身體力行、其實這十二條守則、都是普通做人所應有的枯本修養、不祇是黨員應當遵守、凡是中華民國的國民、無論屬於軍事政治敎育那一界、都應當篤守力行、所以兄弟今天特將黨員守則原文、先唸一遍、然後逐條再來解釋、（全體立正）中國國民黨黨員守則、　忠勇為愛國之本、　孝順為齊家之本、　仁愛為接物之本、　信義為立業之本、　和平為處世之本、　禮節為治事之本、　服從為負責之本、　勤儉為服務之本、　整潔為治身之本、　助人為快樂之本、　　學問為濟世之本、　　有恒為成功之本、（未完）</p>

<h3>洋莊茶棧停兌後　茶葉交易戀態　影響國際貿易及工人生計　皖統制會在滬籌設推銷組</h3>
<p>新聲社云、洋莊茶業忠信昌等十四家、為皖省統制祁茶運銷、於前晨起停兌後、紅綠茶葉出口交易停頓、影饗國外貿易及製茶工人生計、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>茶棧貸欵</p>
<p>洋莊茶業（茶棧）收茶辦法、向係貸欵與各茶號、由茶號向茶農收買茶葉、凡該茶號向茶農收得之茶葉、均歸貸欵之茶棧銷售、再由茶棧售興滬上各洋行出口、茶棧貸欵辦法、以茶號收茶數額為標準、先付現欵若干、及期票若干、是項期票、俟到期承兌、其貸欵利息、按月自一分至一分五不一、此决洋莊茶業公會實行停兌、即對上項期票、雖巳到期、而不予以承兌、</p>
<p>交易停頓</p>
<p>我國茶葉出口、每年約三千萬元、素以祁門紅茶為大宗、今洋莊茶棧實行停兌後、各項交易均吿停頓、目前幸為落令時期、（即淡季）故茶棧損失尙輕、如再過十日、而仍未獲解决、則茶棧茶號茶農、均將受莫大損失、與國際貿易關係甚鉅、因屆時皖省各地新茶上市、茶農採茶後、即交茶號製成運滬、由各茶棧售給洋行出口、今勢必因期票停兌、茶號中止將貨交給茶棧、茶棧無法交易也、</p>
<p>工人集議</p>
<p>上海製茶棧所雇之製茶工人、總約一千二百餘人、將製成之茶裝箱、由茶棧售給洋行出口、惟以綠茶居多、紅茶决之、至於祁鬥紅茶、均係由皖省各茶號之製茶工人製成後運滬、再由滬製茶工人裝箱、直接由茶棧售給洋行出口、俗稱「路莊、」各茶棧實行停兌後、製茶工人、生計影響甚鉅、上海市製茶業工會、對於此案、亦會經開理監事會議、提出討論、</p>
<p>設推銷組</p>
<p>皖省政府為統制祁茶運銷設立紅茶運銷委員會、决在上海設立推銷組、該省已派定曹君到滬籌設、即將由皖來滬、因茶棧貸欵茶號、恒以重利剝削、所以由省政府與銀行界商妥、由交通銀行擔任八十萬元、皖贛地方銀行各任二十五萬元、總共一百三十萬元、直接貸欵與茶號、其利息為按月八厘至一分、較茶棧貸欵利息為低、今省政府巳逐步實行、各茶號亦巳接受貸欵、</p>
<p>財孔談話</p>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙氏、昨午在中央銀行接見記者團時、談及皖省統制紅茶運銷事、據稱皖省統制茶業、實係平衡產銷、不使供過於求、農商均蒙不利、改良品質、使國產茶在國際市場、不致因品劣被摒、故宗旨完全與江浙兩省統制蠶絲事業相同、茶商認為政府與民爭利、殊屬誤會云云、</p>
<h3>浙財廳長程遠帆返杭　公債押欵此次未曾接洽</h3>
<p>浙江省因整理地方公債、發行新債六千萬元、但掉換奮債之後、尙多剩餘的一千萬元、故浙財廳擬以該債六折、向滬銀行界抵押六百萬元、前日浙財廳長程遠帆、晉京謁孔鮮熙、返滬下榻愚園路友人家、國聞社記者昨日往訪、程已於昨晨八時、由滬乘車回杭、聞程氏此决道經上海、對公債餘額押欵一事、未曾向銀行界談及、而銀行界方面之表示、聞倘有切確之担保品、銀行本屬專做存放欵項事宜、今縱有公債押欵、亦無不可、以前浙省雖然一度談及抵押、惟此决程氏經滬、確未提起、故其押欵担保外之利息及期限諸問題、正由雙方磋商中、對各行支配數目、更未决定、</p>
<h3>旅日被逐僑胞　又有四人抵滬</h3>
<p>我國旅日僑胞、前日復有四人搭筑波丸抵滬、上海僑務局得訊、特派員往碼頭照料、並登錄姓名、計劉保仙、年四十歲、旅日十年、在東京市城東區大島町為挑工、童有堯、年三十七歲、旅日十二年、亦在東京市城東大島町為挑工、金本元、年三十四歲、旅日十二年、在名古屋市中心區堀江町為挑工、以上均隸浙江靑田籍、張永一、旅日十一年、在日本新瀉縣營料理業、係山東濟南人、以上回國僑胞、巳於昨日下午、由僑務局分別遺送原籍、</p>

<h3>性病及神經衰弱症之攝生法</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符</p>
<p>本症病源在牛殖腺之衰頹。故其治法除電療外。服藥以生殖腺製劑為最對症。至於平日之攝生法。扼要言之。有如下列數端。</p>
<p>（食養）須攝取滋養料豐富之食物。</p>
<p>（運動）鍜鍊身心。使其强壯。</p>
<p>（養心）切勿憂愁。平心忘慮。淸心寡慾。常抱高尙志趣。樂觀態度。</p>
<p>（切忌）烟酒及有刺戟性之食物。在治療期內。切戒房勞。</p>
<p>（衛生）多受日光。飽吸新鮮空氣。勿過勞。早起早眠。</p>
<h3>安全戒烟談</h3>
<p>— 任國祥</p>
<p>戒烟欲求安全。須先求無痛苦。欲求免除痛苦。先求治其痛患衰病。</p>
<p>在戒烟時期中。因生理上之突起變化。往往苦精神萎靡。而遺精失眠及夙恙舊症。亦乘時發動。為戒烟途中唯一障碍。每使戒烟全功。半途而廢。</p>
<p>安全戒烟。以「生殖素」為最上。良以「生殖素」具有起衰除病之偉效。且能澈底掃除烟毒。迅速斷絕烟癮也。如有遺精之患。當並服「希米脫氏固精片」治之。如有胃痛。則投服「胃痛靈」最效。如苦胃弱。則「健胃素」主之。如罹骨痛。則「强斯登氏骨痛片」根治之。痛患旣除。戒烟自安全竣功矣。</p>

<h3>李惠堂與馮景祥</h3>
<p>我國出席世運會足球選手隊、巳在香港選竣、試演三次、成績都很滿意、今日下午又將在申園演出、以全國選手的最强陣容、展開在我們的眼前、在最近一月來上海足　界蕭寂靜寞之後、球迷們又得刺激興奮一下、今天申園的熱鬧情形是可想而知的了、無疑的、個個球迷都充滿歡忭愉快的情緒、</p>
<p>全國球迷傾心崇拜的球大王李惠堂、這次他榮膺隊長之職、當然是他應得的榮譽、這一回大概是他畢身最後的球場生活了、預料他從歐洲歸國後、恐未必再獻技球場、這是一個很好的機會這樣光榮的退隱是很値得紀念的、他在足球界的一身、的確是成功了、他多年來想去歐洲的美夢、現在也巳現實了、自我的志願巳達、中國的足球也巳到了另一階段的期望了、</p>
<p>這次人選、確實很愼密而達得理想的滿意、據周家騏談、祗有賈幼良比較免強其實道正是給予一位可以造就者的最好的機會、賈幼良是最合乎理想的新進標準人材的、</p>
<p>全隊中新舊球員各佔其半、近十年或巳超出十年以上球場生活的有很多人、他們的技術至今不衰、眞值得佩服、尤其是馮景祥、始終把握着他的黃金時代、這决在香港幾次表演、給予選拔委員最榮譽的批評、球一到他的腳上、如吸力吸住的一般、决不放任亂衝、憑其敏說的智力、造成其餘前鋒都有活動的機會、尤其李惠堂的射門立功、大都得力於馮、但他自已深知不精攻門術、所以從他不打門、在港幾次預選比賽、他祇打過兩次門、都沒有中、李惠堂的技術雖巳退步了許多、因得馮景祥的有力援助、所以他能藉其獨到的射門術為全隊得到最後的勝利、是以最强的前鋒綫、馮李二人是不可缺少一位的、</p>
<p>馮君身體瘦長、彬彬有書生氣槪、平時誰都看不出他是一位足球健將、然而球藝的精練、作戰的驍勇、眞要令人驚嘆不止、</p>
<p>整個中國隊比較欠缺的是右內鋒一職、大致非起用中鋒張顯元不可、卓石金是新進名將、恐還不能把握得住、</p>
<p>這次足球隊是近幾年來全國精英團結的第一次、實力遠在一九三四年第十次遠東大會選手隊之上、雖然大半仍是道幾位選手、但技術上聯絡上都有了顯著的進步了、</p>
<h3>足球選手隊的體格　誰人最高最矮最輕最重最長最幼　提出請朋友答覆到是件趣味的事</h3>
<p>我國世席世運之足球選手廿二人之年齡體格、外間人士、頗欲一知其詳者、查全隊年事最高者為李惠堂與蔡文禮、各為卅一歲、最年輕者為卓石金、僅廿三歲、最重者為孫錦順、計一百七十五磅、最輕者為包家平、僅得一百二十磅半、最高者為蔡文禮、身長五尺十一寸半、最矮者為賈幼良、僅得五尺、全隊平均計算年齡廿六歲半、體重一百四十四磅十四安士、高度五尺六寸、按各國之足球隊員普通年齡多在廿六歲至三十歲之間、體重由一百八十磅至二百磅、高度至低五尺十寸、跑步之速度、雖穿球鞋、然一百碼之成績、通常為十一秒左右、兩相比較、我國頗有不遠之處、茲將各足球選手之年齡高度及體重探錄如下、</p>
<h3>北行機中雜感</h3>
<p>— 惠堂</p>
<p>則乘坐過好幾十次，但在祖國的天空還算破題兒，這回因奉協會電促，趕來上海參加本星期六的比賽，忽忙　速行裝也沒有拾疊完備，到了上海，初春的天氣，依然穿上夏天的服裝，友人們碰頭和自己對鏡自照，也不禁失笑起來</p>
<p>我這次趁機飛滬，空航八小時，眼雖倦而睡不着，書雖好而看不滋味，山川景色雖佳麗，而不能使我全神注意，於是百感蝟集，廻旋腦際，激盪起我寫這篇雜感的資料。我深知我這番空行，會引起了人們三種不同的心理：　「愛之欲其生，」我親愛的家人和好友們，當然希望我沿途寗逸，安抵歇浦，我知我的老人家一定會為我在神前祝福，我的妻兒會為我祈禱，我的好友們會時刻地祝望我平安。　那和我稍為疏遠一點的朋友和球國裏的迷民，自然也不想我遇險。　「惡之欲其死，」那一向妬我恨我和我作對的人們，便另有一種心理了，他們會毒心地咒那飛機失事，把我跌個全身粉碎，給他們拍掌大笑的機會，祇可憐他們的　語不靈，吾則我的內子拿到我的保險費，平地便成小富了。（中略）</p>
<p>這回在機中除了以上的雜感外，我却無時無刻不在思念着那一班同時思念着我的家人和親愛的好友們，幻想着各人的聲容笑貌，忖測着各人在甚麽時候幹甚麽事，來遺我的旅懷。這回的天氣並不十分妥適，途中曾遇風雨，且air　pocket很多，機身顛盪甚劇，使人駭　，但到底還托各人的洪福，卒於安然抵目的地，多吸一番新經騐，這八小時的悶坐是値得的，現在我且把飛行的程序寫在下面，結束我這些雜感。</p>
<p>我得着協會的電報是在二十二日十時，忽忙地辦妥寫字間的公事後，我便於四時五十分乘晚車晋羊石，準備晨六時半飛滬，妻兒們堅要遠送一程，遂同車出發。</p>
<p>二十三早四時半起，促妻兒盥漱，六時乘瓜皮小艇抵二沙頭浮站，六時半起飛，惟以前方霧大，迫得折回，延至八時五十五分始再啟行。同機二西人，良伴有獨立評論二冊，機名「福建」號，由中美機師各一人駕駛。</p>
<p>十一時零七分抵汕頭，有同胞二人趁赴厦門，後始悉為競强體育會董事了君，並承其賜鷄子數枚充飢，加油後十一時二十分再行。</p>
<p>十二時三十分抵厦門，二同胞及一西人離機登陸，十分鐘後繼續飛行，俯視山谷平原，水田萬頃，很像百結的鶉衣，縱橫交錯，蔚為大觀，我國以農立國，信然！</p>
<p>一時五十五分抵福州，亦停十分鐘始續航，抵此間天氣巳漸寒，瑟縮不寗，承機師借罩外衣一襲，始免發抖，自此至溫州，air　pocket最多，同機西人卒患plane　sick嘔吐兩次，我則以慣於航海，得免於苦，但亦有點悶煩了</p>
<p>三時三十分抵溫州，途中遇風雨，寒暑表降至四十七度，加油後，來同胞搭客一，三時四十二分續飛，此為最後一段，需時亦最久，沿路風景秀麗，「柳暗花明又一村，」黃昏時日影斜西，尤覺可愛。</p>
<p>五時二十五分大上海巳在目前，下瞰各地，歷歷如繪，在龍華機塲下降後，合十謝天之佑。</p>
<p>好友余施等及報館記者多人來迓，因悉隊友十二位已於今午外余抵滬，領得小皮箱後，乃驅車寄居「德隣公寓，」總計由朝間抵步時止，共計在空七小　零三十五分，沿路停站四處，惜均逗留十餘分鐘，不克認識各地廬山，這是美中不足。</p>

<h3>金融　純金雖漲　標金反遭挫折</h3>

<p>晨開為一一四三元八角、較前收微升三角、福泰永福大元茂永大德成脫手、退至三元一角、洽豐永益成納條、升為三元三角、永德福興永售條而多盤、滙豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、白銀平衡稅揭曉長七五、此際市况平定、毫無上落、後以元茂永福興永順茂大德成紛售、退至二元九角、洽豐永春源永申變俱進、升至三元二角、入後求供不一、起仆亦微、恒餘景福居於賣方、益成出而後進、而槃旋於三元光景、最後因怛餘購條，午收遂升為一一四三元三角、</p>

<p>塲內交易不多、綜計益成鼎康慶發永洽豐永恒餘申豐惠祥春源永萬興大昌祥愼大永永豐籌居於買方、大德成順茂元茂永祥和大發永永德順寨乾元永等居於賣方、永豐元茂永先出後進、福興永惠祥恒餘先進後出、</p>
<p>查一天市况初穩後疲、晨開為一一四三元八角、後收為一一四三元、計數高為一一四三元八角、最低為一一四二元九角、有九角上落、結果較前收回挫五角、五月份條子剩八千零九十九條、共計多方十五家、空方十八家、六月期籌碼計一萬三千七百三十四條、共計多頭五十三家、空顛二十九家、成交總數、計前市二千三百十七條、後市九百八十條、</p>
<h3>外滙交易掉期居多　—英美兩匯均平—</h3>
<p>滙市昨以銀行對做居多、市况若定、結果英美均平、晨初以海外電吿、倫敦大條、近遠俱升一二五、脚地謂收市後、印度照掛牌價略進之說、紐約銀市縮一二五、蒙得里遠期銀價勿動、及長一厘不等、倫敦生金漲一便士半、英對美縮一二五、英對法跌三磅音、美對英升一二五、美對法勿動、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位漲四厘、匯市晨開近期賣價英匯　先令二便士半、美匯二十九元八一二五、較之前收、計英美俱平、開後銀行略塞、惟以滙豐銀行掛脾、英美俱平、尙形平定、白銀平衡稅揭曉漲七五、銀行略有對做、此後過程依然平定、沙遜及銀行對做先令掉期、牛刻大勢徘徊、後市銀行略塞、遠期美令及先令、但美孚火油公司略有納胃、未起鬱化、印銀報漲四安那、交易不多、前途頗為呆滯、迨收盤近期竇價英匯一先令二便士半、美匯二十九元八一二五、較之　收、計英美兩滙均乏變動、遠期亦然、華商尙少活動、交易以銀行對做居多、其中尤以掉期者居多、今將一天成交價錄後、</p>
<p>英匯晨開近期賣價一先令二便士半、有利售予麥加利五月份半便士、嗬囒售予麥加利七月份四三七五、麥加利售予嗬囒四朋份半便士及半便士五六二五對拾、華僑售予大英五份半便士、華僑塞五月份上半月半便士、沙遜售予麥加利五月份半便士、麥加利售予沙遜七月份四三七五、華比塞七月份四三七五、午收近期賣價一先令二便士半、後市上海售予沙遜七月份四三七五、麥加利售予沙同月同價、收盤賣價現貨一先令二便士半、五月份四三七五及半便士對搭、六月份四三七五、七月份三七五及四三七五對搭、八月份三七五、進價照加零六二五、</p>

<h3>證券　本月份最後一日　公債多空稍有傾軋　市價以多空籌碼係而升沉</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、為本月份期貨最後一天、場上因多空雙方籌碼，尙未能均衡、軋空軋多、仍甚緊張，各帮進山、各視其取捨之不同、為出人之標準、蓋以四月份祗此一日、一般空頭之無貨可交者、不得不照市抵補或掉期、復因此乃現近高遠低狀祝、多方及執有現貨者、均乘機拋近進遠、故市况有倏高倏低、恍惚不定之象、且以茶繭市均巳逼近、金融界用逮漸廣、所有以前之大戶套利交易、多數均備交貨、故市價巳見稍稍回鬆、今日起四月份業巳停止、塲上祇做五月份期貨一個月、趨勢固巳脫離四月份傾軋之羈絆、或當稍稍回跌、昨日經過、上午開盤、完全軋空形勢、多種近期均好一角至三角、遠期則均跌角至三角半、次盤三十五及四十八號等、雖有賣出、戊丁兩種、依然軋空、餘則已轉為軋多、市價仍復參差不一、為數亦有一角至三角之高低、午後開盤、仍係軋多、祇丙種稍有軋室、為近高遠低、餘則巳成近跌遠漲之象、此乃為市價過高所造成、如甲乙兩種、上午則迭見新高價、午後巳漸漸回疲、故收盤仍係混沌之象、高低互見、市價結果、戊甲兩種之本月份、及甲種遠期均好一二角、餘則巳稍回疲、大都略小一角至二角半不等、獨九六為二十三號吸收關係、抬高二角半、成交總數、共計八百五＋八萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較別表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　交貨雖充足　本月紗仍為套利帶起</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、形勢殊覺紊亂不一、蓋以本月期為最後一天營業、交貨亦充足、收貨方面均係套利者居多數、然多空兩方相繼加碼、角逐劇烈、四月期最後一盤價為二百零四元一角、比上月之二百零三元一角、尙漲一元云、</p>
<p>金鷄近遠參差不一</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月平平、形勢依然渙散、惟大戶多頭安然不動、故場中交易殊覺淸澹、但一月期為最後一天、因交充盈、人心看小、而有二千包浮貨被某銀行作套　厘鈿、於是人氣振作、市象轉挺、但　盤以後、聞現紗交易岑寂、轉趨下落、結果遠月比上日收盤價均跌二·三角、惟本月漲二角、午後開盤本月套利者多、市况益緊，市價穩定、遠月帶平、結果四五月期比上日收盤價均漲四七角、遠漲一四角、查賣用長豐二千包、振大四百包、潤康四百包、經華八百包、永昌六百包、晋康五百包、澄記八百包、仁豐五百五十包、協成四百五十包、恒昌五百包、大昶五百包、買進錦昌一千五百五十包、賡豐八百包、森康八百包、益昶一千　百五十包、大孚七百包、合興一千包、愼記四百包、同和五百包、一月間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>紗銷四百餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路較淸、查全日各帮買去統計僅四百零五包、售價漲一元、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>多頭大量收貨　棉花午後頓見回升</h3>
<p>棉市本星期為最後一天營業、多空兩方皆有猛力之爭鬥、棉花檢驗處及格之棉達十四萬一千担、其中粗絨棉占大半、最後一盤角逐愈力、空方壓迫至呌喊一元左右、多方鑒於形勢汹湧、亦竭力抵抗、照市掃數收進、頓見回昇、末盤價為則十五元、比上月之四十三元九角半、漲一元零五分、</p>
<p>本月花抬至五元收盤</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、本月份現品供給雖準備充足、然銀行界既余業商亦全部接受、故本月份局勢反見緊昂、遠月帶起、但二盤以後、以紗市乏力、一般棉商傾向拋空、壓迫尤烈、迨至三收盤復趨下落、結果本月比上日收盤價漲一角、遠跌一角至一角半、午後開盤氣勢平庸、市場議論羣衆看跌、但拍至收盤本月份形勢汹汹、賣聲壯健、益昶照市拖進一萬擔、通記盡量吸收、市價叫喊由三元復達五元、遠期激昂帶漲、結果各月比上午收盤價本月獨漲五角、遠漲一二角、查午後通記獨購五萬六千一百擔、聚興·裕大·慶豐·長豐·信誠·長和·新亭等一律賣出四千外、至六·七·八·千擔之譜、賣出長和四千二百擔、源興昌三千九百擔、信誠八千八百擔、長豐五千叫百擔、也德二千五百担、吉鹽二千七百担、新昶六千九百擔、大孚二千六百担、聚興六千五百担、裕大七千一百擔、賡豐四千四百担、遠記二千九百担、買進通記五萬八千八百擔、合興三千三百担、賡豐一千八百擔、大豐三千三百擔、明德一千二百担、協成二千四百擔、益康一千二百擔、晋康一千二百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉祇有外廠採購</p>
<p>現棉消費平凡、外廠需要稍形活動、來源姚花三百零八包、通化六十包、</p>
<h3>美棉堅穩英印皆跌</h3>
<p>昨美招開盤、市况參差、各月漲一磅音至跌七磅音、晨初陳棉以利物浦消息不佳及國棉處拋售、市價跌落、旋以同業補空而回、新棉則以西部缺雨、比較堅定、惟東部近巳獲雨、紡織品以紗廠减工、較形活動、中途因同業買進及多頭了結、曾有一度起伏、收盤堅穩、計現貨漲三磅音、期貨漲一至四磅音、英棉現期貨均跌一點、印棉日商及歐洲出口商拋賣白羅溪新棉、但投機家統進、計平果　跌三·五至三·七五　比、奧姆辣跌〇·七五至一羅比、白羅溪跌一至一·二五羅比、原電綠左、（二＋三日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十四日白羅溪花之聞盤頂測、四五日期為二百零三羅比、七八月期為二百零四羅比半、均較上日灘一羅比、又明年四五月期為二百維比、均較上日漲一·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花俱形疲弱</h3>
<p>二十四日大阪電、三品期紗跌二角至六角、近月為一百五十五元六角、遠月為一百九十六元八角、期棉跌五分至一角五分、近月為六十五元一角五分、遠月為六十一元四角五分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　受走私影響　華南棉布銷路日蹙</h3>
<p>棉布市情、雖有江浙長江川陝滇黔兩廣諸區陸續採辦、而南路如福州厦門漳州泉州汕頭諸埠、因社會經濟衰落、復以近來走私之風日盛、偷稅棉布時有運入、雖經各地常局嚴密緝查、仍鮮效果、致滬埠運往布疋、日形减縮、北路平津烟臺靑島等地、亦受同等情形之影響、銷路落千丈、致滬上各種疋顛、存貸充斥、前途殊未易樂觀也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紐約絲價降落　華絲外銷更難接近</h3>
<p>日絲在美傾跌甚厲、紐約絲價纔告續降、昨現貨開一·五七五、較前跌四分之譜、橫濱現貨銳跌二十八元、華絲外銷、尙欲持價、故益無起色、昨日某洋行曾接海外來電、但自廠二〇·二二條份、七八月交貨、淮價僅為五百五十元、實萬難接近、用戶美亞綢織廠進自廠絲十五包、價七〇元云、</p>
<h3>杭州毛峰先後開秤</h3>
<p>杭州為店莊茶業集中地、自獅峰龍井茶上市後、連日雨前毛峰、亦復先後開秤、昨據本市行家接到消息、頭號毛峰嫩尖、價開二百四十元、二號芽茶價閒一百八十元、現下蘇滬浙閩各帮茶商雲集、行情頗能站定云、</p>
<h3>祁門打茶上市已旺</h3>
<p>祁門新紅茶、自上週來開始採摘以來、初因天時寒冷產額稀微、近日晴雨調和、茶芽怒發、各鄕茶戶、因恐茶身老草、採摘非常忙碌、祁矚歷山閃里坑下等處、均有大批新貨蜂湧上市、頭靑白毫、號家門莊開秤、每担自七十五元至八十元將來製成熟茶到滬、每担扯價、須在二百元關外云、</p>
<h3>遂安新茶銷路大滯</h3>
<p>浙省遂安新綠茶、昨前兩日來各茶區採枝摘葉、非常忙碌、製茶號家、門莊收靑、每担扯價、須合七十六七元、初時人心旺盛、每日出貨無停留、惟自上海茶棧停止匯兌消息電到後、茶商態度突趨萎靡、多巳暫行停辦、銷路大滯、茶價暴跌至六十五六元、</p>
<h3>糧食　本月粉市氣堅昂</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份初則近堅遠平、繼則致緊昂之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥跌二三角左右、坎拿大跌一二角左右、開價時、本月份因廠碼甚枯、內地小廠、因交割巳近、陸續抵進、待開價即為四角半、後升至六分半、遠期內洋麥報疲、會曾見軟、後則賣氣不暢、又復回穩、迨至下午開盤、本月低最高至七分、交易不多、大廠曾有套售、故未續佳、遠期因天時陰寒、且以本月份之堅硬、遠期方面、不免帶俏、後步終須新麥登場、始有發展之機會、</p>
<h3>期麥後市略緊　新麥登塲尙早</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致平穩、因洋麥雖報小一二三角不等、惟國內新麥登場、尙須經過個月、一般客戶、均以　成難有把握、出數不多、故交易旣少、市氣亦難過鬆、迨至下午盤、各月份交易、仍未見暢、　以紛市略俏、喊價亦復帶緊、較前日　致好三四分不等、現麥市面、仍少變動、開南宿州山東瑤灣麥五元三角、由福新千包云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、預測有零星陣爾、出口與廠需稍　、預料市面將視每日天氣報吿而繼續參差、</p>
<h3>厚早粳再跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、　祇二十餘號、貨共五千餘石、中以薄稻居多，故包胃雖有天津帮辦去二千餘包、市猶居定局、厚早粳本街銷路旣滯、行情再落角許、杜洋尖亦貶數分、陰變　疲勢、</p>

<h3>關於男女工作平等</h3>
<p>— 寒影</p>
<p>男女平等，這口號已喊得久了。但自來有一部分人，常以為男女在其他方面，可以平等，若在工作方面，便沒有平等的可能。因為男女在生理上，有顯著的差別。故社會裏有某些工作，為男子所能的，每為女子所不能。其實這理由是不充分的。男女在生理上，雖有若干不同之點，但這不能作為男女工作不能平等的藉口。</p>
<p>古代社會，男女在工作方面，大都是平等的。現時有些地方，也有女子在外面做男子的工作，而男子反在家裏担任女子的職務。就是現代的蘇俄男女工作方面，機會也是平等的。最近陳友仁的女公子，伊曾寄居蘇俄多年，也對人說過，蘇俄男女工作完全平等，凡科學紅軍航空工廠和其餘各種事業，女子頗多佔重要位置的，如女子才能勝過男子，卽可獲得男子的地位。頃又聞德國政府，將頒布法令，規定全國女子，應於今年一律加入強迫勞動。可見男女在工作方面，是可以平等的。現在的不平等，只是一種習慣。將來這習慣一解除，男女工作，便可以平等了。</p>
<h3>怎樣保持美滿的婚姻</h3>
<p>— 球</p>
<p>那一個男子不願有個白首偕老的愛人？</p>
<p>那一個女子不願長伴着如意郎君？</p>
<p>然而世上正不少失諧鷥鳳，中道棄捐的不幸的離婚事件。倘若以盲目的婚姻始，以無情的脫輻終，猶得諉於舊時婚姻制度的不良。但以兩方自主的愛情結合，而終至於相棄如陌上人的，這樣的不幸事伴，實較之舊式婚姻時過之無不及。這又是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>誰都認結婚是人生戀愛的凱旋；誰都認離婚是人生慘傷的悲劇。我們看了日前報載金通藝與髮妻李淸徵恊議離婚，當李女土在離婚書上執筆簽字時的「淚如泉涌」，便可以了解單方別有新歡而掉頭不顧時，另一方面內心所蘊藏的痛苦為何如了。</p>
<p>據美國卜本諾博土（Dr．Paul　Popenoe）的統計，男女之間，易於構成離婚的因素，一，身心不健康；二，沒有恒產；三，沒有孩子；四，性情孤僻，不善鍾情；五，誤解愛情。大凡這樣的男子或女子，每每做了離婚案子的候補者　健康活潑的身心，是造成美滿婚姻的基本條件。有許多離婚案件，每由於男女一方身體虛弱精神上有了病態，以致於引起了不愉快的夫婦生活，愛情宣吿了死刑，便易於走上離婚之路。在這種情境之中，最好兩方能維持純潔高尙的精神之愛。聰明的丈夫！賢慧的妻子！你倘若不滿意於你對方虛弱的身體，與其去找律師，不如去訪問良醫；與其訴諸法庭，不如送他去住療養院。這樣，未始不可以彌補此生的缺憾。</p>
<p>怎样保持美满的婚姻</p>
<p>「黃金難買美人心」。這句老話反映着財產並不是可以維繫愛情的保險庫。離婚案件中儘有兩方都是有財有勢的。但倘使大家是家徒四壁，兩袖淸風，便更談不到婚姻的安定牢固。不動產是婚姻的寄碇物。流浪的無產階級，只能締結短期的婚媾。倘使連「茅屋藏嬌」都不能辦到，又怎麼禁得住不變為「飄如陌上塵」呢？</p>
<p>夫婦的關係，每因有了子女而加重兩方的連鎖。沒有生育，也是構成離婚的因素之一。我國的舊禮教中所謂「七出」一，便把「無子」列為第一條。據美國人的統計，離婚案件中，沒有子女的超過有子女的三倍。有許多反目夫婦，看在孩子面上，每易於重圓同枕之夢，便是這個道理。</p>
<p>夫婦之愛，雖然出於後天。但實際上卻是靈魂的結合，是終身的伴侶。必須雙方相互的苦於鍾情，而不流於逾分的褻狎，方能保持愛的根苗，而使之發榮滋長。讀過本國名人傳記的人，沒有個不豔稱梁鴻與孟光的相敬如賓。看過浮生六記的人，沒有不個羨慕芸娘對沈三白的溫柔可喜。這都是造成佳耦的內心的要素。</p>
<p>誤解愛情，允以都市中痴迷的男女為甚。都市的生活是奢侈的。住在都市的靑年男女，最容易受物慾的引誘，見異思遷，喜新厭舊，花樣便翻得異乎尋常。平心而論，在男子方面，誰不痛惡水性楊花的薄情女？女子方面，誰不厭恨到處惹草拈花的負心郎？都市中入的離婚案件每每比住在鄉村的超過倍屣。要防止電流的走漏，還是移住在鄕村較為好些。</p>
<p>總而言之：要要保持美滿姻缘，不但要愼重結婚的條件，還要彼此相互諒解，篇於伉儷的眞誠，方能免蹈離婚的覆轍。</p>

<h3>朱君毅夫人談家庭生活</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>家庭經濟須保持固定預算發展本能以家庭為出發點學校與家庭生活彷彿一樣</p>
<p>—值得注意的女兒經—</p>
<p>兒童節的第二天，我正擬束裝返滬，驀地想起了久別的朱君毅博士，不能不去訪問一下，這也有兩種作用：一則闊別多年，可以暢叙衷曲；二則請敎朱夫人對於婦女與家庭的意見。他們的家庭，可以說簡潔樸實，與衆不同，朱博士夫婦向來過平民化的生活，他雖是國民政府的主計官兼統計局副局長，是中央的高級官吏，依然過着儉樸生活，夫人布衣淡裝，操作家政，不改常態，這是很可以作表率的。她也是新女性，曾受高等敎育，中英文很有根底，而唱隨之樂，　勝人一籌，以下便是我們的談話：</p>
<p>家族經濟</p>
<p>大家坐定了，先由我發言：「一般家庭，認為支配經濟，是絕大的難題，需用浩繁，預算不能與决算符合，因此寅屹卯糧，顧此失彼，朱先生是主計官，夫人是有經騐的主婦，對此研究必深，請問有何正確的指示？夫人不假思索地說：「家庭經濟，確是家政中最難解决的一事。富有之家，究屬少數，大剖分的家庭，是靠薪工維持生活的。在此不景氣局面之下，收入有限，而支出無定，當前難關，便是經濟。家庭不論大小，人口不論多少，家用不但應儉約，而且要絕對保持預算。預算之中，必需列儲　一項，所謂有備無患。譬如一個家庭，最小每月儲蓄其收入百分之二十。大概儲蓄之多寡，常視其收入的多少為比例，收入愈多，那末儲蓄的百分比愈大，家用的百分比便小；反之收入愈少，儲蓄的百分比愈小，而家用的百分比便大了。」</p>
<p>「府上家用費所定的標凖怎樣？」</p>
<p>「我們主張不浪費，不濫用，一切經常用費，有一定的標準，因為我們都沒有嗜好，不多方交際，所以很少例外的支出，所定用費的百分比如下：家用（食，住）佔每月收入之百分之三十，雜用佔百分之二十；（如衣着，書藉，玩具，醫藥，應酬，娛樂等。）特支佔百分之十；（如周濟戚友各種捐助）；儲蓄佔百分之四十。」</p>
<p>（二）婦女本能</p>
<p>「夫人主張怎樣可　發展婦女的本能？」</p>
<p>「男女因生理上天然的差異，兩性的本能，便各異其趣。但彼此應就事業的性質，各盡其力，有的事由男子負責，有些事歸女子擔任，根據一人盡其才，才盡其用」的原則，各謀其本能的發展。社會上各種活動，可分為四：如政治組織職業團體，學校與家庭的生活，無論男女都脫離不了這四種活動；我以為婦女至少限度，把家庭生活　　改善，如其不顧家庭，那末社會上四分之一的工作，便無人負責了。究竟男人要負其他四分之三的責任，他們是不適於操持家政的，而且我們女子最能發揮本能的地方，還是在家庭，雖然有些能力卓越的女子，也能做其他各部分的工作，像這般婦女，固然値得我人崇拜，可惜是為數太少了。</p>
<p>「如有一種女子，只知盡情享樂，不盡其天賦的本能，將如何糾正呢？」</p>
<p>專　樂不做事的婦女，在都市中或許有一部分，此外我相信很少的。醫如我國農村婦女，誰不勞動？誰不苦幹？至於糾正那些放浪的女人，先要改正社會的風氣，提倡婦女職業；注重民　敎育；與改善家庭環境；如有正當的書報，娛樂，補充其智識，亦是一法。」</p>
<h3>（成言眞女士）</h3>
<p>（三）家庭生活</p>
<p>「夫人每天的家庭生活，也有一定規律麽」？</p>
<p>「我的家庭生活，彷彿和學生時代刻板式的一樣，成了習慣，倒也不覺得枯燥，時間的如下式：</p>
<p>七時起身後早操</p>
<p>八—九吩咐傭僕當天的工作（如菜肴淸潔等）</p>
<p>十一—十二看書報寫信</p>
<p>一—二陪小兒午睡</p>
<p>三—五陪兒玩有時種植花草</p>
<p>七—化彈琴，聽無綫或應酬</p>
<p>星期日上午在家整理，下午全家作郊外旅行，晚觀電影。說是道樣，但時間並不拘泥的</p>
<p>「慈母對待兒女，往往取溫厚慈祥的態度，不知夫人是怎樣的」？</p>
<p>「慈母保赤之心，大都如此我也主張溫和的，但遇必要時，亦須嚴厲，不能一步放鬆；我的小孩，除正常活動之外，絕對服從父母的指導」。</p>
<p>「賢伉儷平時處事取怎樣的態度」？</p>
<p>「我們是分工合作的。朱先生專心為公服務，不必顧慮家事，反正日常家政，由我辦理，此外仍以雙方同意為依歸」</p>
<p>至此一席談話，吿一結束。</p>
<h3>美國婦女在家庭中之活動　（美國通訊）</h3>
<p>— 大千</p>
<p>欲知美國婦女在家庭中活動情形，非即長期在其家中居住者，殆難得其崖略。美國有一流行風俗，凡經濟不甚寬裕之家，往往以其餘屋出租。租屋辦法，共分三種：第一種租屋不供給家具被褥，第二種供給家具被褥，第三種供給家具被褥兼供給膳食。第一種辦法，主客鮮接觸，仍難覘婦女之活動情況；第二種辦法，稍可見到一二；第三種辦法，則客之居處飮食，咸由主婦管理主婦之治家情形，客自無有不知者矣。予蓋居住於一美國人家庭中為第三種客，而積有年餘之經歷者也。後此所述，皆此年餘中之所見所聞。</p>
<p>主人之祖先為德人，婦之祖先為英之愛爾蘭人，主人年已在六十外，婦亦達六十，育二女，均早巳出嫁，主人因之乃有餘屋出租。當予初入其家時，接觸於眼簾者，深訝其家之到處整潔，地板光滑無纖塵，幾致不忍下足。巳而繳納房飯金於主人，主人拂卻曰：「此媽MA（美國人稱家之主婦為媽與我國北方人之稱母相似）之事，與我無關，勿交我手」。自此知家內事蓋屬之主婦矣　主婦晨起甚早，冬季在六時左右，夏季尚稍提早，主人則每較遲。主婦日常工作，除一日三餐之烹飪洗滌外，並為一家之人錦疊被褥。予雅不欲過事優養，故吿以願自整理晨起後之被褥，然每星期一次之更換枕衣被罩並鋪疊整齊，仍出之主婦手焉。</p>
<p>主婦淸理各室，的分小淸理大淸理兩種辦法，小淸理每日舉行，視各室之有不潔者就不潔之處淸理之。大淸理每星期開始必舉行一次，各室之板壁，地毯，家具等無一不淸理。主人有屋大小達八間，每至半日尙不能淸理完畢，但其整潔之情况，即終不使稍異也。</p>
<p>主婦為節省用度計，衣服之可自洗滌者，如主人及已以及予之小件衣等常自洗，每星期所洗亦不少，而主人則始終未嘗見其一為之。主人亦有工作，住屋前後士地之整理，由其負責，而婦殆不過問，有時食後當主婦洗滌用具時，主人問其須助吾，婦亦報以無須，一家內外分治之局，似頗顯然。</p>
<p>一日，主人之二女壻咸來歸，一家七人共餐，餐畢，予為循向例，表示相助之意起見，擬自送所用餐具至洗浟處，主婦及共二女咸來阻止曰：「汝等男子請安坐，此乃我儕婦女等之事」。予笑謂「相助無妨乃送予所用之餐具至洗滌處。主人之二壻，則始終安坐未動，長女自廚房來，附耳小語其夫，二壻忽成自送餐具至洗滌處。反而觀之，治餐洗滌等係女事，在美已成風俗，不亦可見乎？</p>
<p>日常用餐情形，主婦治餐就緒，羅陳桌上，乃請予及主人就食，事前予與主人，但高坐以待而巳。有時主婦治餐畢，戲作滑稽之聲調呼予及主人曰：「來呀！先生們，飯菜治好矣！」予與主人聞之，不禁為之失笑，主人因向不過問廚事之故，乃至完全不贈烹飪。在此年餘中，曾有一星期餘，主婦臥病在床，予與主人之餐無着，主婦乃喚其兩女輪流來助。次女家居，尙屬不甚忙碌，長女則夫在銀行任事，巳亦在學校任教職，尙勉强分片刻時聞，驅車前來料理予及主人之餐事，而此女子之事，主人始終未克代勞，仍終屬女子之事也。</p>
<p>主婦於日常工作之餘，以閱讀報章雜誌，或與其夫作葉子戲消遺。有時尚作女工，予笑謂曰：「媽得母太勞乎」？則亦笑答曰：「我美有一流行諺語：「男子工作，日出而作，日入而止；女子工作，永無巳時Man’s　Work　from　sun　to　suoi　Woman’s　werk　never　beone」我女子也，工作寗有巳時哉？」</p>
<p>主人夫婦二人所受之敎育程度，雖屬同係中學畢業資格，但主婦之程度，似較優於主人，主人亦屢言之，有時主婦尙欲與予談當時在校所演之代數問題及德文會話短句，似尙未盡全忘者，而彼對於其夫，意態間似仍頗尊崇，家中要事，以取决於其夫者為多。憶予曾與主婦商量略事更動室內家具，主婦不敢有所表示，囑予先商諸其夫，迨與主人商後，不待再商諸主婦，而可吾巳出諸其一口矣。</p>
<p>一家之情形，一人之行動，顯然不足以槪其餘，但美國人工極貴，每日僅來淸理數小時之女傭，尙須出工資月數十元乃至百元左右。故雖文學校之敎授家中，亦大率無女傭，而家事仍不廢。余曾涉足美國老少友人家中，先後無慮數十處，室內槪甚淸潔，此亦可為談美國婦女在家庭活動情况之一助也，</p>
<h3>婦女孕期的衛生</h3>
<p>— 怡盧</p>
<p>——不可忽略的幾件事——</p>
<p>懷孕，這在婦女們本來是一件很平常的事，但是初次懷孕的婦女們。對於懷孕，因為沒有經騐。每視為一件恐懼的事。再加之俗諺有「行船走馬三分命，養孩子在棺材邊上走一遭」的話，更使初懷孕的婦女們加上一層恐懼的心情。其實這種心理，對於生育的前途是很有關係的。所以作丈夫的，對於初次懷孕的妻子，要給伊們以相當的解釋和安慰。因為在懷孕期內的婦女，的確是很容易生病，如果確定了巳經受孕以後，最好能到產科醫院裏去作全身檢查，有沒有病狀？能不能安然生育？對於孕婦及胎兒，有沒有危險？如果有的話，應該趕快治療，因為根據醫院的原理，凡是肺癆；心病；花柳病等，與孕婦和胎見都有關係的。至於嘔吐等，雖然是孕期中應有的現象，然而如果嘔吐過度，而色又發黃的話，也要請醫生看看，以防疾病的侵襲。</p>
<p>關於孕期內的衛生，也是很重要的。飲食方面：肉類不宜多吃，蔬菜水菓是很有益的。至於烟酒等項有刺激性的食物，那是要絕對禁止的。衣服方面：不宜太緊，太緊了血脈循環就不暢了！所以衣服要寬大，溫度也要適宜，不能穿的太多或是太少。睡眠的時間，每天最少要在八小時以上，午後，如果能夠小睡一兩個鐘頭，那也很有益的。在快要生產的前一兩個月，更宜多睡，如果睡眠不足，對於孕婦的精神，和胎兒的生長，都有關係的。操作方面，除了孕期的末一兩個月，不宜操作外，其餘的時候，依然可以操作的。但是不宜洗衣，不宜舉重！不宜攀高：以免發生墮胎（俗謂小產）的危險。此外如孕婦不宜過哀，以免觸動胎氣，更不能受到意外的驚恐，如果能夠休養得宜，那在生產的時候，是不會發生危險的。不過孕婦們切忌有恐懼的心理，這一點，是希望懷孕的婦女們，和伊的家屬加以注意的。</p>
<h3>鄕村的婦女</h3>
<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>我想中國的新典型的女性，一定要到鄕村裏去找。</p>
<p>在都市裏，除了一些勞苦大衆的女性，為着了生活，每天一天到晚不得休暇地掙扎着，和環境苦悶着以外，其他所謂典型的女性，大都是太太型，少奶奶型，小姐型的：伊們具有了十足嫵媚的姿態，又十足具有了消費消閒的性好，伊們的最大本領，便是飾容，打牌，和發驕傲脾氣。至淤都市的普遍性婦女現象，也大部份受着虛偽，歪曲的習氣的薰陶：而「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」了！</p>
<p>鄕村的婦女們，非但絕沒染有都市的一些奢侈驕傲的惡習，而且都有着勸奮耐勞的精神。伊們是夠頌讚的哪！一個個都穿着了樸素土布衣服，顯着極端儉約的態度；伊們都有着眞正健美的體格，能一天到晚不停的操作，勞動，而沒有都市小姐的「病態美；」伊們的皮膚都是黑黑的，更沒有蔻丹，洋脂，洋粉，香水精等的裝飾品……。</p>
<p>早晨，在東方還祗浮起了魚白色，伊們巳經推窗開門起身了。於是，淘米啦，打掃啦，洗拭啦，燒飯啦，……這些日常應有的工作便開始。—羊腸小道上來往着一個個汲水，搗米籮的婦女，太陽從東方的水平錢上漸漸露了臉，每一個村落裏，飄起着被風打旋的炊烟；—這便是鄕村晨之風景綫。</p>
<p>伊們日常除了辛勤料理家務，如浣洗縫紉等工作以外，逢到了田野農忙的時期，伊們也上田頭助男子們的勞作。並且有地也常常上市街挑着菜蔬，提着蛋類等去求售，助理男子作小販，補助家用伊們雖也多有着幼年的子女累在身旁，但伊們的一切勞作，還是毫不偷懶的進行着。。</p>
<p>總之，鄕村的婦女是有着堅毅耐勞的偉大精神的，伊們雖生活在痛苦的源淵裏；但有着含辛茹苦的掙扎本能，這在都市的摩登婦女們是値得一學的。</p>
<h3>女子家庭俱樂部</h3>
<p>— （何歸）</p>
<p>美國之紐約市，最近有「女子家庭俱樂部」Girls　Home　Club之創設。凡十四歲以上二十歲以下之女子，如在家庭中，或因家人不睦，或環境不佳，或發生事變，以致生活不幸者，皆可暫住於俱樂部中，收費極為低廉，雖成立日淺，尙無顯著之成續，然數月之間，女子之入俱樂部而得與家庭和解者，巳實繁有徒云。</p>
<h3>從閨闥到議會</h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>——土耳其婦女的猛進——</p>
<p>在各國婦女解放的歷史中，土耳其婦女特別顯示煊赫的光彩。在不到二十年間，脫離束縛伊們的閨闥，拋棄伊們的面幕，進而獲得選舉權，且投身於操縱全國政治的議會中。就婦女進步的速度言，土耳其婦女委實是首屈一指的。</p>
<p>說解放前的土耳其婦女的落後是受回敎的影響，乃是傳統的誤解。當穆罕默德未降臨的時候，土耳其婦女確實度着最悲慘的生活。重男輕女，殺女嬰，一夫多妻，是回敎創始前早已有之的事。「可蘭經」，倒是替婦女拖不平的；在這經典中我們可以找到說起男女平等的句子。就是對於一夫多妻制度，可蘭經的主張也是限制的而不是提倡的：「假如你能夠公平待遇，你可以娶一個，兩個，三個，或四個女人；要是你不能，你娶一個」。</p>
<p>在回敎創始後的早期，士耳共婦女倒享受着相當的自由。伊們可以斥私資從事伊們願意做的事業而不必得丈夫的允許；伊們可以出門旅行或經商：伊們可以參加各種文學，社會與政治的集會。從七世紀到十五世紀間，土耳其的故土出過不少女作家，女演說家，女教授。</p>
<p>政治的腐敗，男子的奢侈，一夫多妻的盛行，漸漸使士耳其婦女的地位低落，生活束縛，自由剝奪，終於使土耳其婦女以最落後見稱於世。可是，土耳其婦女還是幸運的，因為到了十九世紀的末期，伊們就開始重又抬頭了。</p>
<p>在那時期，土耳其的上等婦女開始學習英語，德語，法語，並研究政治，音樂，哲學等科目。後來，外人開設女校，使土耳其婦女獲得高深知識。在大戰發生前，土耳其婦女已有脫除面幕陪伴丈夫到歐洲求學去的。大戰發生，男子從軍，女子代替工作，這是土耳其婦女從事職業的開始。</p>
<p>新總統凱末爾執政後，士耳其婦女領受大大的恩賜。他革除一夫多妻制，勵行普及敎育，提倡婦女參政，使土耳共婦女在知識與政治上面獲得與男子均等的機會。目前，在士耳其婦女中，有律師，有法官，有化學師，有工程師，有文學家，有新聞記者，有市議員，有警察。去年，國會對婦女開放，被選為國會議員的土耳其婦女達十七人。</p>
<p>假如說西方的美國是婦女的樂園，那麽東方的土耳其就是婦女的競技塲了</p>

<h3>文明的自殺</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>英陸相古柏氏生日，在孟卻斯德發表演說，略謂今日歐洲的大局，較之一九一四年，允形嚴重。其輸贏更高，故所失亦將愈大。我人自歐戰之後，所獲眞正的進步，只有製造毀滅的利器而巳。這無殊為文明的自殺。文明的自殺，或將於我人的時代見之。</p>
<p>文明原是文化進步的表示。近代人的文化，顯然又比古時，進步得多丁。故二十世紀，大家稱之為文明的世紀。然而文明之在今日，却已陷於破產的地步了。除少數藉文明為幌子，以遂其野心的，還在誇耀文明之外，許多人對於文明，都要加以咒詛。原因現在所謂文明，己失去文明的眞正意義，而成為一種變相的野蠻了。不見連弱肉强食，也算是文明了嗎？</p>
<p>英陸相古柏氏的話是不錯的，自歐戰之後，世界所獲眞正的進步，只有製造毀滅的利器而巳。試看近幾年來，列强所專心致力的，無不是軍備擴張這件事，今日歐洲的大局，所以較一九一四年，允形嚴重，便是因這而造成的。這在一般野心家視之，也要認為是一種文明的表現。但是實在說，却無異是文明的自殺了。</p>
<p>一九一四年的歐洲大戰，大家是還記得淸楚的。四年間的砲火，不知屠殺了多少的生靈，摧殘了多少的文化。這顯然是一種文明的自殺了，可是人類的慘禍，才過去不久，現在各國，又在準備作第二次的戰爭了。一般黷武主義者，彼此在摩拳擦掌，躍躍欲試。而且歐洲有一個野心國家，正在用毒瓦斯向東菲宣揚文明。東亞也有一個友邦，不斷在和我國實行親善。還有德國的撕毀條的，這也是向外發展的預算。至若奧國，匈牙利，土耳其，保加利亞，希臘諸國的要求軍備平等，亦可視為未來戰爭的準備。凡這種種事實，都是說世界已向文明自殺之途前進。雖然目下還有不少人，在設法維持和平。有的倡議建立歐洲聯邦，有的主張組織美洲共和國聯合會，有的希望成就亞洲聯盟。然而這些偉業，只是一部分強者的企圖。世界的浩刦，是無可避免的。</p>
<p>我也如古柏氏一樣，擔心文明的自殺，或將在我人的時代見之。</p>
<h3>芝祥嫂</h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>—故鄉紀事—</p>
<p>毒太陽從村前的山嶺翻了個筋斗，跌下去了。只在天邊泛起一朶朶幻異的霞彩。晚凉的風吹拂着，吹散渾身為熱浪所襲擊着的疲累。人在這刻才得鬆了口氣，孩子們成羣在廣場上捉迷藏。</p>
<p>新月像怕羞的少女倩妝升出來，月光朦朧地照滿大地，對過簇簇的樹木描着憧憧的黑影。</p>
<p>婦人們理畢了家務，亦各自抓了隻矮凳子走到廣場乘凉。雜亂的話腔，嗡嗡地充塞空間。</p>
<p>一列列堅立在背後的屋子空寂的，靜悄悄沒個鬼影子。有個人忘記帶扇子，跑回家，看見麻臉寡婦芝祥嫂獨在簷階的角落里，在一盞昏黃的洋油燈下，兩手不停地做釘工，屋子內這時候是比白天更悶熱的，那人不禁開了口道：</p>
<p>「芝祥嫂你眞像木頭，天這樣熱煞，全不覺得，不想出去吹吹凉，別又弄出毛病來。」</p>
<p>「趕明兒耍去交貨啊，實在沒這福份。」</p>
<p>那人自顧自出去了芝祥嫂方略略抬上腦袋微微嘆息一下。對於剛才這人的好意和關心戚她自然感激的而那幾句話卻又無端觸着了的心靈的傷疤。使她想起了別人的日子與自己的日子，她能夠跟誰比擬麽？不，人家都有男子養活，她的男子呢？三年前出去了。三年來靠着自己一付賤骨頭，十隻磨不斷的指頭，日夜作息，撐持兩個兒子合自己三口嘴的生計。她不得有片刻貪圖懶惰，假如貪圖片刻的懶惰，明天就得餓肚……</p>
<p>於是無論在什麼時候，就在這樣燠氣的季節，人們都離開蒸寵一樣的屋子到村外。唯賸下她單個兒在那盞昏黃的燈前勞碌着，及至深夜，人們回來入睡以後，她還是伴着深夜的凄凉的寂寞，伴着更昏黃燈，直到身體困怠到不能支持為止。</p>
<p>想到這裏，芝祥嫂又舉起首來，眼睛望黑沉沉的天井掠了一團，隨卽來了幾聲嘆。</p>
<p>驀然自外面傳進一陣女孩子的啼哭啼哭裏不停地：柘榴弟你這亡父子，你這短命小鬼。那樣駡着。</p>
<p>芝祥嫂放下手中的針具，凝神地聽着。她立卽明白哭啼啼着的那支聲音就是保爺的女兒阿花，柘榴弟是她自己的孩子，大概又是柘榴弟殺野，打了阿花，鬧出禍來了。保爺在村中是有身份有錢有勢的尖角兒，阿花當然是金枝玉葉，不准人動一動的。</p>
<p>氣忿的　着脚，芝祥嫂已悄悄跨出屋子大門外。</p>
<p>廣場上的情形淸楚地映在眼底。柘榴弟遠遠地躲在士牆那兒，阿花還故意</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>似的高聲呌啼，她的娘保奶拐着凸屁股想趕上去，一壁咒：</p>
<p>「柘榴弟，這你臭雜種，阿花是你打得，好，瞧你逃上天去，不敲碎你的狗腦袋，不知我的利害」。</p>
<p>雖然是小孩伙里時肘鬧的把戲，却亦會惹起大人們兇頭兇腦的出氣一番。而旁邊的人呢？不消說都替保奶助威，說柘榴弟眞太潑野，小個子，動不動打人，怎要得，該敎訓教訓的。</p>
<p>冒上一肚子火的芝祥嫂，馬上走上去抓住柘榴弟的臂腕，像獅子攫着小兔，揑着拳頭，望柘榴弟的背膊咚咚地狠命摜個不住，吊上來，兩脚離地，連拖帶推走回屋子。</p>
<p>柘榴弟亦哭了。</p>
<p>—保奶，請別生氣，饒他小孩子不知死活的。</p>
<p>走過保奶跟前的時侯，芝祥嫂恭敬地賠了罪不是。</p>
<p>保奶陰狠的，滿意地笑着，說道：</p>
<p>—呃，不算什麽。的，但你這孩子得管敎得嚴，第二次可不再便宜了他！</p>
<p>一點瑣事，就儘嘔狗氣，瞧人家的臭嘴臉。傷心，自怨，幾乎壓倒了芝祥嫂，她的眼眶裏巳包了兩泓淚水。回到屋子中，越尋思越懊惱，又把柘榴摜打一場，——唯一的洩氣的方法。</p>
<p>柘榴弟哭的更夠勁，芝祥嫂坐在一邊暗暗抽咽。</p>
<h3>鄕會</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>儀仗慢慢的過去了，黃綢的幃，紫緞子的萬民傘，錫的香爐臘扞，茶担，八寶箱，紅衣裳的假犯人，綠衣裳的小姑娘，活皂隸的面孔，活動的戲文，——似乎每一個人有一點滿足，而且評說那會的好壞，阿根不懂什麼，先是愛那些紅綠色采的每一樣東西，「肉身燈」的一塊血淋淋樣的有點傷心，「活皂隸」的面孔有點害怕。不懂事的孩子全是一樣</p>
<p>「讓開點！高蹺來了，讓開！讓開」</p>
<p>當高蹺入的木脚一雙雙出現，而且有聲有色的做着戲文，大家的精神集中在一點，落在後面的先是向前面擁，想看得淸楚點。</p>
<p>米舖短欄干後面的份量是沉重的，又是多年的杉木，早已發出格格的聲響，但是噪鬧裏大家不曾留意，一經過重的壓力，起了變化。</p>
<p>站在後面長板凳上的立脚不穩向前一齊倒，前面的受着了突然的吃驚，大家向前面擠上去，只聽得豁刺一聲大響，短欄干跟着人一齊倒下去，阿根和阿毛也倒下去。一片噪雜的喊哭，爬的爬，壓着，踏着，那裏沒有人性，也沒有情感，誰能站起來就起來，誰都管不得女子，孩子，只有自已一個。</p>
<p>沉靜下來了，許多人流着血，折斷了腿，阿根和阿毛沒有聲音，頭部貼着石人街的石子，短欄干壓在身上，血一大堆，也不知是別人的還是他們自已的。懂事的急慌拿起短欄干，扶起他們，蒼白的臉上掛着血，張大着嘴，似乎想喊，不曾出口，就被什麽塞住了。眼晴白白地，有一口短促的呼吸。</p>
<p>「去呌阿根的媽」。一個聲音。</p>
<p>「還有阿毛呢」！又是一個聲音。</p>
<p>「血喲！血喲！老爺前面的香灰」。</p>
<p>「你看，那末大一個口，血—血」。</p>
<p>！　！　！又是粗聲氣地，人叢裏竄出一個中年婦人，臉上是一股驚嚇所罩住的，頭上的汗直徜着，嘴裏在喊</p>
<p>「那？那裏！」</p>
<p>「二老爺的轎子來了」兩副「迥避」，「肅靜」的銀朱漆上的黑字，一輛牛角車上面堆着紙做的綾綢，金銀，最後一座轎子，裏面一位藍面孔的泥菩薩，眼睛瞪着怪有神，小孩子瞪着眼睛，大孩子，女人們合着手一個敬禮，</p>
<p>「完了，完了」。</p>
<p>許多散閒的跟着會的尾巴走，看會的人在四處　　，一個花白頭髪的在感慨地：</p>
<p>「每年出會終得傷了幾個人的，今年只是兩個小的，還好」。</p>
<p>「是喲，老伯，怕別地方還有呢」。</p>
<p>「嗯！嗯！」</p>
<p>會走遠去，旗的尖頂也看不見，　聲也沒有了，那裏剩下來一片沉靜，賣甘蔗的，在整理担子預備走。</p>
<p>過一會，那條街上還是一樣淸靜，流過血的地方，也沒有注意，米舖裏的一個夥計不時看他手臂上的傷口滲出血來。</p>
<h3>在塘沽的小旅舍中</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>為着趁不着南行的船，我在塘沽一家小旅舍里住了下來。</p>
<p>在旅舍里的日子是悠長的，一顆急於南行的心，好像整天放在油鍋里煎熬着那樣難過。路費是有限的，但船期卻一天挨延過一天，眞像永不會有船隻南開那樣子。於是這小旅舍就成了我的囚牢，日子亦就過得越發憂鬱了。</p>
<p>那時候正是末秋。一到末秋，北國的景象是十分蕭索的。尤其是在塘沽，似乎更加荒凉，連天亦終日愁着臉，一點也不明朗。工廠里高高的烟突，朝天吐着巨龍一樣的媒烟，隨着秋風，猛撲着每個路人的臉</p>
<p>不曉得為什麼，從第一天起我便憎厭着這臨海的市鎭。每天除開早上到船票局探問船期之外，我成天守着這小旅舍，再不想跨過街門一步。白天，小旅舍里總有一些下等的客人在那里喧鬧着，擁擠着，午後賣冰糖葫蘆的小販一來，他們就圍着他抽籤。我時常在這狹小的客堂里踱着，看看他們紅的臉孔紅的眼睛，同爭吵時候的粗魯的言語。這樣，日子雖然過的寂寞，倒也易於打發的</p>
<p>在樓下的小院子里長着一株槐樹。站在我的房里。便可看見牠的尖端。那時候雖是深秋，但葉子還沒脫盡。傍晚，倚着房門，看那戰敗的萎黃的槐葉，在晚風中一片片地辭了故枝，籟籟地飄墜下去，又給帶到屋角，發生一陣陣像老人的嘆息那樣低微的，瑟索的聲音。也就在這時候，對過房子里那位客人，已吃過了晚飯，坐在房門外拉起那悲惻的二胡。小旅舍在黃昏中是靜寂的，黃昏的塘沽也是靜寂的，二胡的悲聲在靜寂中哀哀地響着，像一個悲傷的旅人的哭訴。聽到這悲惻的聲音，我只好熄滅了燈躲在房角里讓辛酸的，寂寞的淚痛快地流下去。</p>
<p>那時候我也時常想着一些虛測的事情，那些連自己也不曉得為什麽會想起的事情，接着，就絕望地嘲笑我自己，自己的懦弱，消極同頹唐。每當夜半，隔壁的驢子嘶嘶的呌着，蹄子踩着石板的聲音把我鬧醒過來的時候，隣居雜亂的夢囈，夥計們煩膩的鼾聲，落棄的低泣，秋風的鳴咽，都使我感到無限的寂寞。我不只是一個無伴的旅人，我從小就在孤獨中長大起來，如同一隻忘了時序的候烏。（未完）</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Deliberates on the National Assembly Organization Law; All Twenty Articles Complete First Reading; Articles One to Three Pass Second Reading; Remaining Articles to Be Discussed at Next Legislative Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened its 57th meeting on the morning of the 24th. Sixty-four members, including Li Zhonggong, were present. Chairman Sun Ke and Secretary-General Liang Hancao presided. The National Assembly Organization Law completed its first reading, and the first, second, and third articles of the law were amended and passed in the second reading. The remaining articles will be discussed at the next meeting next week. During the deliberation, Chuan Bingchang, the convener of the 24-member committee, first reported on the review process, stating that although the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law were issued by the central government to the Yuan at the same time, the two laws each have their independence. Therefore, the draft of the National Assembly Organization Law was first completed and submitted to the meeting for deliberation. The Representative Election Law will be submitted to the meeting next week after the issue of representative quota allocation is resolved. The content of this law is very simple. Most of the articles are based on the principles issued by the central government. Other articles related to procedures and processes not covered by the principles are also based on the provisions of the previous National Assembly Organization Law. When drafting this law, the issue of the powers of the National Assembly was carefully considered, and a major question was discovered, namely, whether the National Assembly, in addition to drafting the constitution, should also exercise the powers conferred by the constitution in the future, or whether another National Assembly should be convened to exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. After repeated research by colleagues, the result was only to follow the principles issued by the central government, stipulating that the powers of this National Assembly are to draft the constitution and exercise the powers conferred by the National Assembly, and did not dare to make any other provisions. Some appointed members of the 24-member committee resigned for various reasons. It is hoped that the legislative spirit of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Representative Election Law should strive to be close to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. It is believed that there is no violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings in the legislative spirit of the Representative Election Law. It was then explained that the National Assembly referred to in this law is not the National Assembly in the constitutional draft. Therefore, its organization, powers, session, etc., are also different from the content of the National Assembly in the constitutional draft. Cheng Zhongxing said that since the nature is different, a special label should be added to the title of this law to show the distinction between the two. Chuan Bingchang insisted on maintaining the original proposal. Lin Bin also said that people really do not want the National Assembly convened this time to act as the National Assembly in the constitutional draft, but the difference lies in the content and not in the title. Subsequently, the chairman ordered the secretary to begin the first reading. Then the second reading began. Articles 1, 2, and 3 were amended and passed. However, during the discussion of Article 2 on the powers of the National Assembly, the committees engaged in fierce debate. Some argued that the National Assembly this time should only draft the constitution, while others argued that in addition to drafting the constitution, the National Assembly should also exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. If another National Assembly is convened after the constitution is promulgated to exercise the powers conferred by the constitution, it would be inconvenient in practice and uneconomical in form. As a result, it was still stipulated that in addition to drafting the constitution, the National Assembly should also exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. The articles after Article 4 will be discussed at the Yuan meeting next week. (Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft attached table of the allocation of representative quotas for the four northeastern provinces to the National Assembly originally stipulated 23 representatives for the fellow countrymen from the Northeast living abroad. Zhang Xueliang, Qi Shiying, and others sent telegrams requesting an increase. The Central Standing Committee resolved to merge the quota with the representative quotas for various provinces and cities. It is reported that the fellow countrymen from the Northeast living abroad have exchanged views on the representative quota and election issues several times. It is practically impossible to conduct elections for professional groups. The regulations for regional elections stipulate that they should be merged with the allocations for various provinces and cities, but regional elections must be based on the population ratio. How should this practical difficulty be remedied, and what election methods should be adopted? Currently, the majority advocate convening a meeting of fellow countrymen from the four northeastern provinces living abroad in Beijing to discuss ways to remedy the aforementioned difficulties.

<p>Chuan Bingchang's Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly Organization Law, drafted by the drafting committee of the Legislative Yuan, was submitted for discussion at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 24th. The full text consists of 20 articles. The members debated the powers and attendance of the organization law for more than two hours. As a result, only the second reading reached Article 3. Starting from Article 4, it was decided to discuss it at the next meeting. First, Chuan Bingchang, the convener of the drafting committee, reported on the drafting process, mainly stating that the Central Committee's second clause, "Other official powers conferred by the constitution," has generated many opinions. The task of the first National Assembly is to draft the constitution. As for drafting the preliminary law and implementing the powers conferred by the constitution after the constitution is implemented, further research is needed. According to the central government's opinion and the actual situation, it was decided to hold a National Assembly, so the powers of this National Assembly are stipulated as: drafting the constitution; and exercising other powers conferred by the constitution.</p>
<p>Powers of the National Assembly</p>
<p>Liu Guanshi first stood up to discuss the drafting and revision of the constitution, saying that attention should be paid to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and strengthen the people's belief. Lin Bin said that although the draft constitution has been revised several times, the National Assembly part has not changed much. Cheng Zhongxing said that the main task of the first National Assembly is to draft the constitution, and it seems that a clear statement should be made in the front section of the National Assembly Organization Law about this primary task. Lin Bin said that the drafting committee also studied Cheng's opinion and finally considered it unnecessary. Zhang Zhihan advocated starting the initial reading, and then the initial reading was completed. The second reading officially began with a discussion of (Article 1): "The National Assembly is organized by representatives of the National Assembly elected by the people." "The National Assembly Representative Election Law shall be separately stipulated." Passed. (Article 2) The powers of the National Assembly are as follows: 1. Draft the constitution; 2. "Other powers conferred by the constitution." There was much debate over the second item. Luo Ding first proposed changing the word "other" in the second item to "all." Zhang Zhihan believed that the meaning of the word "other" was unclear and advocated deleting it. Zhong Tianxin advocated explicitly stipulating the election of the president. Fu Bingchang explained that it is practically impossible to convene another National Assembly after the constitution is drafted, so the powers of this National Assembly are not limited to drafting the constitution. At this point in the discussion, President Sun took out the decision made by the Central Standing Committee on the 23rd regarding the revision of the constitution, which stipulated that "the powers of the first National Assembly shall be exercised by the National Assembly that drafts the constitution." This means that there are clear regulations for the exercise of powers.</p>
<p>Revision Rejected</p>
<p>Shi Weihuan advocated revising the powers section to "The National Assembly shall draft the constitution and exercise the powers conferred by the constitution." Chen Changheng advocated changing it to the powers conferred after the constitution is promulgated. Yang Gongda disagreed with Chen, saying that since there is no such thing as before the constitution is promulgated, the phrase "after the constitution is promulgated" seems redundant, and advocated maintaining the original proposal. Zheng Hongnian said that it is now transitioning from political tutelage to constitutionalism, so even though it is a transition, it is a preparation for the constitutional period, and the organization of the National Assembly should be thoroughly discussed, and it is also advocated that legislative members should also attend the National Assembly. Lou Tongsun said that if the first National Assembly to draft the constitution and the other powers are parallel in space, then the original article does not need to be revised. If drafting the constitution and other powers have a temporal nature, then the other powers in this law should be revised, and it is advocated that if revisions are needed, it can be revised to exercise the powers conferred by the constitution. Lu Zhiyi said that the organization law stipulates that members of the Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee can attend, but whether they will still attend after the constitution is passed at the National Assembly is still unclear. Shang Shangkuan believes that this point should be stipulated in the draft constitution. Then President Sun put the revisions proposed by Lou Tongsun and Shi Weihuan to a vote as "The National Assembly shall draft the constitution and exercise the powers conferred by the constitution." Of the 64 people present, 21 raised their hands, a minority, and the revision was rejected.</p>
<p>Attendance of Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The chairman then proposed an amendment: 1. "Draft the constitution"; 2. "Exercise the powers conferred by the constitution," deleting the word "other" and adding the word "exercise." Thirty-four people voted in favor and it passed. (Article 3) The National Assembly shall be convened regularly by the National Government. The meeting place of the National Assembly shall be located where the National Government is located. Passed. (Article 4) When the National Assembly is in session, members of the Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party may attend. Luo Yunyan made some statements regarding the attendance of members of the Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee at the National Assembly. Chen Ruxuan advocated attendance. Liang Hancao advocated that this point should be decided when the Central Committee's revised draft constitution is sent to the Yuan for discussion. President Sun then rose and declared that the attendance of members of the Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee at the National Assembly is a principle decided by the Central Committee, and the Yuan has no right to change it. Wu Jingxiong believes that attendance should be stipulated. Li Zhonggong agreed. Liang Hancao proposed discussing it next week. Chen Changheng, Liu Ke, Lu Zhiyi, and others continued to express their opinions, but no decision was made. As a result, President Sun announced that starting from Article 4, it was decided to hold another second reading at the next meeting. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Dai and Yu's Opinions on the Central Government's Amendment Principles</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee passed a resolution on the allocation of representative quotas for the four northeastern provinces in the National Assembly, which should be merged with the representative quotas for various provinces and cities. It was sent to the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 24th. Sun Ke handed it over to the 24-member committee. The convener of the committee, Chuan Bingchang, handed over the case to the five members, including Lin Bin, who originally drafted the initial draft of the two laws, for review. In addition, Dai Chuanxian and Yu Youren had contributed opinions when the Central Committee amended the principles of the National Assembly Representative Election Law. These opinions have also been sent by the Central Committee to the Legislative Yuan together with the amendment principles.</p>
<p>(A) Dai Chuanxian's opinion: The number of representatives from free professional groups, a total of 58, can remain unchanged according to the original plan. However, the number of representatives from the lawyer group is too large and should be reduced appropriately, and the amount reduced from the lawyer group should be added to the education group, the engineer group, and other free professional groups. Please ask the chairman to submit this opinion to the Legislative Yuan for consideration.</p>
<p>(B) Yu Youren's opinion: Xinjiang's ethnic groups are complex, and the current situation is indeed more advanced than before. However, looking at the table of representative quotas in Xinjiang, it feels that the number is too small. It is hoped that the number of teachers can be increased under a reasonable proportion.</p>
<p>(C) Amendment principles: 1. The total number of various representatives in the National Assembly is stipulated as follows: 1. The number of regional representatives from various provinces and cities is 687; 2. The number of representatives from professional groups in various provinces and cities is 322; 3. The number of representatives from free professional groups is 58; 4. The number of representatives from Mongolia and Tibet is 40; 5.

The detailed allocation of the above items shall be increased or decreased by the Legislative Yuan within the respective total amounts, referring to the opinions of the members. 2. The third item of Principle C of the Election Law is amended to: "The provincial government may endorse the candidates recommended by each electoral district and submit them to the central government to designate three times the number of representatives to be elected in each district." 3. The name "Industrial Groups" stipulated in the fourth item of Principle B of the Election Law shall be deleted. (Central News Agency dispatch from 24th)</p>
<h3>Sorting Out the Articles of the Draft Constitution, Chuan Bingchang and Others Initially Exchange Opinions, Comparing and Studying the Original Draft and Ten Revised Points, Deciding to Hold the First Review Meeting on the 27th</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee passed the amendment principles of the draft constitution in accordance with the review opinions. On the morning of the 24th, it was sent to the Legislative Yuan to sort out the articles. President Sun handed it over to Wu Jingxiong, Fu Bingchang, Ma Yinchu, Wu Shangying, He Sui, the five chairmen of the Legal System, Economic, Financial, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs Committees, as well as Secretary-General Liang Hancao, members Lin Biao, Qu Zenger, and eight others as review members, designating Fu Bingchang to convene. At 2:00 p.m. on the 24th, Fu Bingchang, Liang Hancao, Lin Biao, Qu Zenger, and four others initially exchanged opinions at Chuan's private residence, comparing and studying the original draft of the constitution and the ten amendments submitted by the Central Standing Committee, and discussing in detail how to add, delete, and make statements. It was not until 6:00 p.m. that they dispersed, deciding to hold the first review meeting on the 27th. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee's review report on the draft constitution was sent to the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 24th. Sun Ke immediately approved and assigned Liang Hancao, Chuan Bingchang, Wu Jingxiong, Ma Yinchu, Wu Shangying, He Sui, Lin Bin, Qu Zenger, and eight others to be responsible for the review. At 3:00 p.m., Fu invited Liang, Wu, Lin, and others to initially exchange opinions, and decided to convene a formal review meeting again on the 27th or 28th. It is expected that the Yuan meeting next week can submit it for deliberation, and the promise to announce the draft constitution on May 5th can be fulfilled. The Central Standing Committee's decision on the articles to be revised again has specific regulations, and some only make principled regulations, all of which are waiting for the Legislative Yuan to sort out the articles again. Other terms of office for the president, vice president, and national representatives have been changed from four years to six years, and the terms of office for the heads of the five Yuan and the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan have been changed from four years to three years. The convocation period of the National Assembly has been changed from every two years to every three years. Regarding the regulations on the article authorizing the president to issue emergency decrees, the review report proposes that "When the country encounters an emergency crisis or a major economic change occurs and rapid disposal is required, the president shall request the Executive Yuan to resolve the issue and may issue emergency decrees." However, the Legislative Yuan still needs to sort out the articles again. The important contents of the so-called transitional articles are three: 1. The powers of the first National Assembly shall be exercised by the National Assembly that drafts the constitution; 2. Part of the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan shall be temporarily elected by the people, and part shall be temporarily appointed by the government until complete popular elections at an appropriate time; 3. County magistrates shall be temporarily appointed by the government and then popularly elected after local self-government is completed. In addition, there have also been slight revisions to the chapters on local systems, national economy, and education. (Central News Agency dispatch from 24th)</p>

<h3>Shanxi's Various Armies Have Completed Deployment, Deciding to Launch a Full-Scale General Attack on the Bandits; Chen Cheng Completes Military Deployment and Arrives in Taiyuan to Meet Yan; Bandits in Hejin and Ningji Disintegrate and Flee</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Chen Cheng went to Lingshi to command the bandit suppression military affairs and has already summoned the generals in front to personally impart secrets. He has completed the deployment of the various armies and ordered a full-scale general attack on the Xu, Liu, Peng, and other bandits in the Lingshi, Xiaoyi, and Xixian areas. Chen took the Datong-Puzhou train north this morning and arrived in Taiyuan at around 2:00 p.m. Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Gao Guizi, and others went to the station to welcome him. Zhao Daiwen then went to the reception office to visit Chen and had a long conversation. Chen is scheduled to meet Yan tonight to report on the recent progress of the offensive in front and the military deployment. The counties of Hejin and Ningji are currently being severely attacked by the National Army, and there is no trace of bandits. They have all disintegrated into small groups of hundreds, disguised themselves, abandoned their weapons, and fled north. This group is the Lin Biao bandit unit and is still being cleared by Yang Chengyuan. There are currently more than 2,000 bandits gathered north of Daning City. In addition, Liang's brigade of Yang Chengyuan's unit launched an attack on the bandits on the morning of the 23rd and engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in the Renyi Village and Gaimai Village area. The bandits resisted stubbornly. After Brigade Commander Liang supervised the team to attack, the bandits began to retreat north at noon. More than 200 bandits were killed in this battle. Liang's brigade is still pursuing and suppressing them. (Dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) When Yan Xishan heard that Chen Cheng had returned to the province from Lingshi this afternoon, he personally went to the reception office to visit him at around 4:00 p.m. Chen reported in detail on the battle situation in front and the inspection of the deployment of various armies. Then, a long and detailed discussion was held on the military affairs of clearing the remaining bandits in Lingshi, Xiaoyi, and other places. In recent days, the communist bandits on all sides have been in a dilemma and extremely embarrassed, and have been abandoning their weapons and surrendering to our troops. The Appeasement Office has recently received a telegram from Regiment Commander Lu of Yonghe on the 23rd stating that several bandits came from near Nanshan Leibao this morning, claiming to surrender. Among them was a military doctor, who said that Lin Biao's bandit leader's headquarters was in a village more than ten miles northwest of Lu Mountain, and the first, second, and third divisions and the independent division under its jurisdiction are now all entrenched in Yonghe, a total of more than 3,000 people. The independent division is with the military headquarters in Lu Mountain. After receiving the telegram, Yan believed that it was difficult for the Lin bandits to continue to act recklessly by entrenching themselves in a corner, and ordered the various departments to block them strictly. Yan held a banquet for Pan and Wang at the Appeasement Office at 6:00 p.m. tonight, inviting Zhao Pilian and others to accompany them. After the banquet, Yan and Pan had a detailed discussion on the autonomy of Mongolia and the prevention of communism, as well as the situation after visiting the central authorities in Beijing.

<h3>Hebei Education Department Orders Various Schools in Tianjin to Strictly Prevent the Communist Party</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In order to prevent communism, the Hebei Education Department issued an order to various schools in Tianjin to strictly prevent it and to report and inform on those suspected of being communist. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>

The military deployment for the prevention of communism in southern Hebei has been completed. The bandit gangs have been dispersed by Feng's division of the 29th Army. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>President Jiang Orders All Provinces to Carefully Select County Magistrates</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Jiang believes that some county magistrates in various places are too old, too lethargic, and physically weak and mentally depressed to preside over county administration, and it is difficult to expect them to govern effectively. On the 24th, he specifically ordered the Ministry of the Interior to forward the order to all provinces to carefully select county magistrates and to revise the current regulations on the appointment examination of county magistrates with the Ministry of Personnel. The original order stated: "The position of county magistrate is extremely important. At this time of refreshing all kinds of government affairs, how should the provinces carefully select and select true talents to jointly manage the country? However, recently, it has been found that some county magistrates in various places are too old, too lethargic, physically weak, and mentally depressed. This President has repeatedly seen this during his inspections. If such people are county magistrates, their achievements and abilities can be imagined. Even if there are good laws and policies, they are afraid that they will be improperly implemented and poorly supervised, resulting in the loss of their essence. In the future, the provinces should pay close attention to the above points when selecting candidates for county magistrates, and should especially select people who are physically sound, have sharp ears and eyes, are knowledgeable in governance, and know their duties. The Ministry of the Interior should follow this spirit and inform all provinces to comply. At the same time, the Ministry should cooperate with the Ministry of Personnel to understand this intention and revise the current regulations on the appointment examination of county magistrates in order to comply with them. This is a matter of urgency and should be complied with." (Central News Agency dispatch from 24th)</p>

<h3>Abrogation of Treaties, Military Reorganization, and Defense Movements</h3>
<p>— Established</p>
<p>Since Germany unilaterally abrogated the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles last March and reorganized its military, countries like Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey have been envious and eager to follow Germany's example in abrogating treaties and reorganizing their militaries. However, due to the complexity of international relations, they have been apprehensive and have not dared to take decisive action, choosing to endure for the time being. This March, Germany again abrogated the Locarno Treaties and marched into the Rhineland area. Consequently, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey could no longer restrain themselves and began to emulate Germany. Those directly imitating Germany included Austria, which reinstated conscription, and Turkey, which restored the defenses of the Dardanelles Strait. Those who dared not unilaterally abrogate treaties but expressed a desire for revisions included Hungary, Bulgaria, and Greece.</p>
<p>Austria is a region that Germany and Italy inevitably compete for in Central Europe. Since Germany has reorganized its military and marched into the Rhineland, displaying a high degree of arrogance, Italy naturally wants to strictly guard against it using swift and decisive means to annex Austria and thereby expand its power in Southern Europe. Therefore, after Germany marched into the Rhineland, Italy convened a meeting in Rome with Italy, Austria, and Hungary to discuss how to enhance the military strength of the three-nation bloc to counter Germany's policy towards Austria. After the meeting, the Austrian Parliament decided to reinstate conscription. Thus, this action was at least partly instigated by Italy. Although France was unwilling for Austria to reorganize its military and pose a threat to the Little Entente countries, it had to let it happen to restrain Germany by leveraging Italy. Since France did not object, the Little Entente countries naturally did not strongly object either. Therefore, its military reorganization, while the contradictions among Germany, Italy, and France remain unresolved, can smoothly become a "fait accompli," just like Germany's military reorganization last year.</p>
<p>Although the Treaty of Lausanne after the Greco-Turkish War allowed Turkey to recover some of the territory lost in the Treaty of Sèvres, it still could not restore the defenses of the Dardanelles Strait, which was a constant concern for Turkey. On the 11th of this month, Turkey used Germany's abrogation of treaties and military reorganization as a pretext to notify Greece of its demand to revise the Treaty of Lausanne and restore the defenses of the Dardanelles Strait. At the same time, it notified the League of Nations, requesting that this matter be included on the agenda of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on May 11th. After Turkey's notification, Greece proposed a counter-proposal, demanding the restoration of the defenses of Lemnos, Mytilene, Chios, and Samos. Because Britain wanted to compete with Italy for hegemony in the Mediterranean Sea and restrain Italy's actions in the eastern Mediterranean, it was relatively willing to accept Turkey's demands. The Soviet Union has a good relationship with Turkey. It believed that if the fortification of the Turkish Straits succeeded, it would be equivalent to building a line of defense on the Black Sea coast, so it also expressed sympathy. However, Turkey did not wait for the revision of the treaties and directly advanced into the strait area on the 17th.</p>
<p>Hungary followed Austria in abrogating treaties and made demands for military reorganization, but it was immediately met with strong opposition from the Little Entente countries and did not succeed. This is because the Little Entente countries were formed from territories lost by Austria-Hungary. The simultaneous restoration of military strength by Austria and Hungary would cause them to feel enormous pressure, so they had to strongly oppose it. Although Bulgaria also hoped to revise treaties and reorganize its military, it has not yet formally proposed it.</p>
<p>The continuous occurrence of abrogating treaties, military reorganizations, and the establishment of defenses further sharpens international contradictions. Moreover, after abrogating treaties, reorganizing its military, and establishing defenses, Germany is preparing to demand the restoration of colonies, which is also a common need for Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The realization of this demand will increase the sharpness of contradictions and promote the outbreak of war. Therefore, the day they implement the restoration of colonies may be the day that a major war breaks out.</p>
<h3>Yongjian as the Center: Convening a North China Japanese Military Attache Conference – Scheduled to Open on the 27th – Agenda Divided into Four Points – Japanese Consulate in Tianjin Discusses Strengthening Police Powers</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The North China Japanese Military Attache Conference is scheduled to open on the 27th, with Yongjian as the center.

The rest of them will return to Peiping no later than the 27th to attend the memorial service. Regarding the anti-communist issue, because both the Communist Party and bandits are enemies of the people of East Asia, China and Japan should both guard against them. Therefore, mutual consultations are inevitable, which has caused outside rumors that China and Japan will sign an anti-communist agreement, which is not the case. The Hebei-Chahar authorities are working hard to study anti-communism. If the bandits in Shanxi endanger the lives and property of Japanese residents, it will be difficult to treat it lightly.

After the meeting, according to Bao Yueqing, after the snowfall at the end of September last year, there was a heavy snowfall every three to five days, which was even more serious this spring. Mongolians rely on nomadism for a living, and cattle and sheep depend on water and grass to live. Recently, the land has been covered with ice and snow, and all the grass and trees have been buried. The people are running out of food and fuel, so many have died of cold and starvation. Due to the lack of both water and grass, almost all of the cattle and sheep have now died. In view of the severity of the Mongolian disaster, the central government has agreed to allocate 40,000 yuan for relief, but the Mongolian land is vast and the number of disaster victims is in the hundreds of thousands. The amount of 40,000 yuan is insignificant. Therefore, we urge the press community to appeal widely to make the society pay attention to the Mongolian disaster and provide relief.

According to what he told people on the ship: "China's dispatch of a commercial attache has been a pending matter for years, and now it has finally materialized, which is truly gratifying for both China and Japan. As the first commercial attache, I certainly have some aspirations, but I am not yet ready to express them. Once I have investigated the economic situation of the responsible country, I will naturally strive to promote economic cooperation between China and Japan." (24th Allied Press)</p>
<h3>Japan and the Puppet State Sign a Treaty to Abandon Extraterritorial Rights, Effective July 1st</h3>
<p>The new treaty signed between "Manchukuo" and Japan will come into effect on July 1st. Japan will abandon its extraterritorial rights in Manchuria and hand over the administrative and taxation rights in the South Manchurian Railway Zone to the "Manchu" government.

<h3>European Warplanes Lurking, Germany Actively Expanding Military Preparations, Spending 800 Million Pounds Last Year, Only Collective Action by All Countries Can Avert Disaster, Churchill Warns the British House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons re-debated the budget this afternoon. Churchill made startling disclosures about Germany's expansion of military preparations, citing figures to support his argument, saying that the European crisis is now heading towards the extreme. He is certain that the current Parliament will see this extreme. If the major powers do not resolve their differences, join hands, and maintain the current era of light and prosperity for billions of working people, then there will be a major explosion in Europe. The cost of the disaster is beyond imagination and beyond human sight. He believes that only a strong British military, with a determination and courage that does not seek other things but only seeks peace and is not afraid of difficulties but only strives for peace, can avert disaster and secure human happiness. (Listeners cheered loudly)</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, Churchill said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain had done a great job in reorganizing national finances since 1926, but the funds he had allocated for rearming were insufficient, which made one unable to avoid doubt.</p>
<p>He had heard from very reliable sources that Germany's public debt had increased sharply by 7,000,000,000 marks from the end of May 1933 to the end of June 1935. In addition, tax revenues were no less than 5,000,000,000 marks. Therefore, in the two and a half years, at least an additional 12,000,000,000 marks were spent in addition to the budget expenditures. Furthermore, during this period, Germany's capital expenditure (excluding those used for housing) totaled 24,000,000,000 marks. Since Germany prohibits private artificial factories from expanding purely for economic reasons, it can be seen that this amount of expenditure is generally used for war preparations. The above capital expenditure figures were obtained from official publications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Germany's national income increased from 1,200,000,000 marks in 1933 to 11,000,000,000 marks in 1935. This was indeed needed by Germany to revive its arms industry. It is estimated that since Hitler came to power, Germany has received about 20,000,000,000 marks. Therefore, his claim that Germany spent 800,000,000 British pounds on war preparations in 1935 alone is not without basis. This is truly a huge amount. He hoped that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would respond to this. (23rd Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Shipbuilding Program, to be Announced Soon, Adding 27 Ships Within Two Years</h3>

<h3>US Military Plans, Establishing an Aviation Base on the Pacific Coast, Maintaining an Army of 165,000</h3>
<p>(Washington) The House Naval Affairs Committee today submitted a report to the House, advocating the establishment of a naval air station in Alameda, California, with content similar to that recently proposed by the Senate Army and Navy Committees. (23rd National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The army budget of 572,000,000 yuan was previously passed by both the Senate and the House, but the numbers voted on were slightly different. A joint conference of the two houses met today to discuss the matter and reached a consensus, advocating retaining the amendments proposed by the Senate, that is, stipulating that the strength of the army should be 165,000 men, but the river port expenditure should be reduced by 37 million yuan. (23rd National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Tydings (Democrat Senator from Maryland), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Overseas Territories, recently submitted a draft law to the Senate, advocating that a referendum be held in the US territory of Puerto Rico in 1937 to vote on the issue of independence, and that complete autonomy be granted to the island within that year. Puerto Rico originally belonged to Spain. After the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, it was assigned to the United States under the Treaty of Paris. Recently, the number of residents on the island who belong to the nationalist faction is about 5,000. They advocate independence and are very active. At the beginning of last month, the head of the island's police department, Colonel Riggs, was assassinated by members of the Nationalist Party. The party leader, Tubos, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to resist the United States. (24th Havas)</p>

<h3>Britain Will Inquire into Germany's True Intentions, Focusing on Two Points: Germany's Relationship with Southeastern Neighbors, and Explanation of the So-Called Equal Rights Demands, Questionnaire Still Awaiting Cabinet Study</h3>
<p>(London) In accordance with the resolutions passed by the Second Locarno Conference, the British government will submit questions to Germany, asking it to provide supplementary explanations to the memorandum of March 31. The Cabinet is now scheduled to hold a Cabinet meeting next Wednesday to study these questions. It is generally speculated that these questions are based on the French memorandum of April 7, and their content must be extremely precise and accurate. According to political figures, the focus of the questions should be the following two points: 1. Germany's relationship with its Eastern and Southeastern neighbors; 2. Germany's interpretation of equal rights. Regarding the first point, the British government should ask the German government if it claims to be willing to conclude non-aggression pacts with its neighbors, but the British believe that in the event of a dispute, the various clauses of the League of Nations Covenant should still be observed first, and the various clauses of the non-aggression pact should not be applied. Regarding this point, Germany is ready to acknowledge. Also, what are Germany's intentions towards Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Lithuania? Regarding the second point, the colonial issue is the most important. What Britain is asking is under what conditions and when Germany can be considered to have fully enjoyed equal rights. In addition to these two points, the issue of Germany not building fortifications along the Rhine River (at least during future negotiations on European construction projects) may also be raised by Britain. However, British figures do not have much hope for this level. Generally speaking, after the wording of the British note to Germany is drafted by the Cabinet, it should be sent to the German government by Sir Phipps, the British Ambassador to Germany. As for the rumors that Foreign Secretary Eden will personally go to Berlin, Foreign Office officials have repeatedly denied this, only saying that the Cabinet once considered sending Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, to Germany, but this proposal has been mentioned but not yet decided. However, the majority of political figures believe that under the current circumstances, sending personnel to Germany is not appropriate. This opinion should be adopted by the Cabinet. (23rd Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British government, in accordance with the resolutions passed by the Second Locarno Conference, will submit a questionnaire to Germany, asking it to provide supplementary explanations to the memorandum of March 31. Political figures here believe that once this questionnaire is submitted, the British and German governments should exchange notes for consultation. The content of the questionnaire is generally as follows: 1. If European countries accept the plan proposed by Germany, will Germany rejoin the League of Nations? 2. Regarding the issue of building fortifications in the Rhine River region, what are Germany's true intentions? 3. Will Germany respect the territorial integrity of Central European countries? 4. Regarding the colonial issue, what are Germany's goals? 5. Regarding the issues of limiting armaments and concluding aerial agreements, what are Germany's true intentions? 6. Is Germany willing to participate in collective security organizations within the scope of the League of Nations? 7. Can Germany's borders (as stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles) maintain the current state? (24th Havas)</p>
<h3>France Also Expresses That It Will Not Give Up Mandated Territories, Cameroon Is Becoming Increasingly Prosperous, Opposing Being Ruled by Germans Again</h3>
<p>(Paris) Truveta de, the head of the Department of Mandated Territories, gave a radio speech last night, saying that France's inability to consider giving up mandated territories is no different from Britain's. Cameroon has become increasingly prosperous since it was placed under French mandate, and the indigenous people have benefited first. Truveta cited various statistics to prove his point, ending by saying that the indigenous people have now increased by 300,000 and must not be subjected to the rule of Germans with deep-rooted racial prejudice again.

<h3>The Turkish Government Drafts a Convention to Replace the Straits Clauses of Lausanne and to Conform to the Principle of Freedom of Navigation. France's Reply Has Been Sent Out.</h3>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey: The local "Dan" newspaper recently reported that the Turkish government is currently drafting a draft convention to be submitted for discussion when the signatory countries to the Treaty of Lausanne hold a special meeting to study the Straits issue (i.e., the issue of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits). This draft is intended to replace Article 18 of the Treaty of Lausanne, namely the treaty on the demilitarization of the Straits, and should be linked to the principle of freedom of navigation stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. In other words, in addition to abolishing the demilitarization system, it also advocates that merchant ships of all countries should be free to pass through. The political conference of the Balkan Entente countries (i.e., Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece) will definitely discuss this issue at its next meeting, but it has not yet been included on the agenda.

<h3>Polish and Hungarian Authorities Conduct Political Talks, Willing to Maintain Existing Amity, Commercial Agreement Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: After arriving here today, Polish Prime Minister Kościałkowski drove to visit Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kanya. In the evening, Prime Minister Gömbös hosted a banquet, during which the hosts and guests had a cordial and uninterrupted conversation, all praising the friendly relations between Hungary and Poland, which have lasted for a century. Today, the relations between the two countries should preserve the old friendship. (22nd Havas) Budapest, Hungary: It is still unknown what the political talks conducted this morning by the Polish Prime Minister with Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kanya were about, but Prime Minister Gömbös said at the banquet last night that he was willing to correct the current situation in Europe by peaceful means. Kościałkowski said, "No important issue can be discussed unless all the countries concerned participate together and obtain their consent." Political figures believe that Hungary still wants to correct the borders stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles, while Poland wants to participate in various issues in the Danube River basin. The main points of the talks between the two sides may be no more than this. (24th Havas)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary: Polish Prime Minister Kościałkowski signed two agreements this morning with Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kanya, one on the extradition of criminals and the other a commercial agreement.

<h3>Austrian Social Democratic Party Activities, France Feels Deeply Uneasy, Fearing the Realization of German-Austrian Merger</h3>

<h3>Stagnant International Trade, Economic Warfare Contributes to the Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The annual report of the Liverpool Corn Trade Association, which was released today, stated that the characteristic of 1935-36 was the local distribution of agricultural products, resulting in the quantity of international trade falling to a low level. The economic warfare of the past six years has created the tragic situation of today, causing widespread anxiety and agitation in Europe and the Far East. After Germany's entry into the Rhineland and the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian war, currencies became more unstable and the atmosphere became even more tense. Therefore, the situation in the grain market last year has not improved slightly, and the economy has become more chaotic. European countries change their policies daily, almost every day. Almost all countries are subsidizing farmers, but the result is only poorer quality products and reduced bread consumption in Europe. (24th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Several Italian Bombers Revolve Over the Capital of Abyssinia for Reconnaissance; Abyssinian Elite Troops Guard Strategic Passes to Hinder Enemy Advance; Fierce Battle on the Southern Front for Three Days, Italian Army Turns Defeat into Victory</h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Several Italian bombers circled over the Abyssinian capital from 7:00 to 8:00 this morning, but did not drop any bombs. Their purpose must have been to reconnoiter the situation. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that the battles on the northern and southern fronts of Abyssinia are very active. According to a telegram from a correspondent with the Italian army on the northern front, Italian aircraft are currently using bombs and machine guns to fiercely bombard Abyssinian troops 40 miles southwest of Tai, diverting the river to destroy the main road to the Abyssinian capital. Another correspondent with the Abyssinian army reported that several thousand Abyssinian soldiers are successively arriving on camels at the west road of Tai, where they are being reorganized. The elite of the Abyssinian army is currently guarding the strategic mountain passes connecting the west road of Tai, which are very difficult to break through. According to estimates by engineers, the Italian army will need to repair the main road to the Abyssinian capital before they can advance, which will take at least two months. In another month, the rainy season will arrive, and Abyssinia will then have a strong army. At the same time, General Nasibu, commander of the Abyssinian army on the southern front, reported that there was a major battle around Mount Kikko, north of Danaaki. Although the Italian army aided the Philippine troops with strong infantry, the result was a draw. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to today's official announcement here, the Italian army is preparing to launch a strong attack on the Hindenburg line built by the Abyssinian army in the area between Dagaabur and Dagahamedo. Italian aircraft have already bombed this strongly defended position with bombs today. The Italian army is still advancing along various parts of the southern front. The Italian army, starting from Tai, has arrived at the town of Ur Lairu today without encountering resistance. According to a Belgian officer who recently arrived in Goboti from Abyssinia, the Abyssinian side does not want to defend the Abyssinian capital. The chief of the Abyssinian capital's police department and the American advisor to the Abyssinian King have formed a delegation to greet the Italian army 25 miles outside the Abyssinian capital with the keys to the city. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Officials have just announced that the Abyssinian army engaged in a fierce battle with the Italian army south of the city of Sassabane in the Wogaden province on the southern front on the 17th of this month, resulting in a victory, killing thousands of enemy soldiers. The Italian army retreated 40 kilometers, but soon resumed the offensive, forcing the Abyssinian army to retreat to the Donnan area. (Havas Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: General Nasibu, the commander of the forward troops of the Abyssinian army on the eastern front, telegraphed today reporting that his troops engaged in a fierce battle with the Italian army for three days between Sassabane and Donnan, 105 miles south of Harar, and have been forced to retreat. The total number of casualties on both sides was three thousand. This news of defeat has increased the chaos here. General Nasibu's report stated that his troops attacked the Italian army and fought them hand-to-hand for three days before driving them back, but the Italian army continued to mobilize reinforcements to counterattack, and the Abyssinian army could not withstand it and retreated. General Nasibu's troops are still being reorganized and concentrated on the eastern front, while the Crown Prince's troops are on high alert northeast of the capital. The Emperor is reportedly personally leading troops west of Tai to resist the Italian army's advance. North of Tai, bandits are rampant and deserters fill the countryside. Rumors here say that the bandits are now eyeing the capital. If the government decides to move the capital, they are preparing to enter the city and plunder. The old and young here are crowding into shelters to take refuge, or fleeing their homes to the deep mountains. All the able-bodied men are on the front lines. Because the Italian army is advancing so rapidly, the foreign Red Cross seems to have completely lost its effectiveness, and foreign ambulance personnel are also preparing to leave. The Belgian military advisor to the Abyssinian Emperor has resigned and left, and the Dutch Red Cross has also been ordered to return on May 1st. The day of Abyssinia's complete defeat is not far away. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Our correspondent O'Chartnet reports that after the Italian army on the northern front won successive victories, all the able-bodied men in the Abyssinian capital have been drafted to resist the enemy. In addition, Italian aircraft can come to bomb at any time, causing the residents of the city to flee, leaving the city completely empty. All the shops are closed, and the whole city presents a desolate scene. There are still several thousand foreign residents, protected by the embassies of nine countries. The Greeks are the most numerous, with 550 in the capital and 1,500 in the provinces. There are six Japanese, currently protected by their embassy. Each embassy has dug cellars, and most of the foreigners have taken refuge in them. The French embassy has erected huge tents nearby, where 1,500 foreigners from fourteen countries are living, but no French people are among them. A grocery store and an American bar have been opened there (established by a White Russian nobleman, Prince Georgie), forming a village. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>Jewish-Arab Ethnic Feud; Disturbances Continue in Palestine</h3>
<p>Tel Aviv: Our correspondent reports that traffic between this city and the city of Difa has been effectively cut off. Armed police patrol the streets in both places to maintain order. In the countryside, Arabs continue to harass, intercepting and attacking cars that pass by, and setting fire to a truck loaded with food. Iron nails have been scattered on the roads, making it impossible for vehicles to travel. In the city of Hedda, many rioters set fire to vegetable gardens. In Hebron, where a riot occurred in 1929 with a terrible massacre, the local authorities, fearing a repeat of the tragedy, have ordered all residents of the city to move to Jerusalem. Residents of other small towns, such as Acre and Beisan, have also been ordered to temporarily move to major cities. The Arabs in the port of Haifa have now declared a general strike, forcing Jewish shops to close, resulting in the arrest of many by the authorities. The authorities in other major cities have also begun to arrest Arabs who cause trouble. Several disturbances occurred in Jerusalem today. The authorities in the city, fearing that the local Arab population will take the opportunity to hold large-scale demonstrations on Friday, when they hold prayers, have taken precautions.

<h3>Hebei-Chahar Diplomacy Focuses on the Anti-Communist Problem; China and Japan Are Negotiating in Tianjin; Japanese Warships From Lushun Arrive to Guard North China</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Hebei-Chahar diplomatic negotiations, centered on anti-communism in North China, have resumed after the chief of staff of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, Nagami, went to Tokyo to attend the commander's meeting and consulted with the military headquarters, and has now returned. However, due to the different perspectives of the two sides, the issue itself has become difficult to resolve. The Japanese side is determined to adhere to the principle of "anti-communism first, diplomacy second," and their preconceived notions are deeply rooted. Our authorities, after repeatedly consulting with them, are now working to discuss both matters and resolve them simultaneously. On the 21st, Nagami, accompanied by Ishii, staff officer of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin, and the translator Hirai, went to Xiao Zhenying's residence in the Beining official residence on Haihe Road in the special district, and met with Xiao Zhenying. Those present included Chen Juesheng, Feng Zhi'an, commander of the 37th Division of the 29th Army, and Song Meicun, chief of the General Staff of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters. They exchanged views on the international situation, the current situation in North China, the entry and exit of communists, and local security for an hour and a half. Nagami stated that the Japanese military headquarters had already decided on a policy and had no right to change it, and could only make slight adjustments within its scope. It was impossible to overturn the case. After the meeting, Nagami left, and Xiao, Feng, Chen, Song, etc., went to visit Song Zheyuan at No. 133 Road in the British Concession, reported in detail, and consulted. After summarizing concrete opinions, at about 2:00 p.m., Xiao Zhenying and Lin Shize, superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, visited Nagami at the Zhangyuan official residence in the Japanese Concession, conveyed Song's intentions, and consulted for another hour or so, before departing at 3:30 p.m. After two meetings on the same day, the two sides have reached a concrete solution. Chen Zhongfu, a full-time member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, came to Tianjin on the night of the 21st, planning to visit Nagami for a third round of talks with Xiao and Lin on the morning of the 22nd. The Japanese side will convene military officers from various parts of North China in Tianjin in the near future to jointly decide on how to implement anti-communist methods and resolve the Hebei-Chahar issue, and then respond to our side. Matsumoto, the head of the Japanese military special service agency stationed in Beijing, Imai, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Wachi, the head of the Japanese military special service agency stationed in Taiyuan, Hayama, the head of the Japanese military special service agency stationed in Zhangjiakou, and Omoto, the Japanese military officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, will all come to Tianjin within a few days to participate in the meeting. The Kwantung Army Department of Japan has ordered Hosoki Shigeru, the newly appointed head of the special service agency stationed in Yu Pass, to participate in this consultation. Hosoki has arrived in Tianjin on the 21st to await. Our foreign affairs authorities have recently not denied the Japanese proposal to conclude an anti-communist agreement between China and Japan in North China. It is said that the Japanese side did request this. Since we have agreed to jointly defend against the communists, we cannot but conclude a method to show the restriction. Otherwise, under the guise of anti-communism, troops will be stationed everywhere, occupying land, without any limit. Is this anti-communism? It is simply aggression. Therefore, the crux of the issue is to negotiate the content of the agreement, and the opinions of each other still need to be exchanged for a considerable period before they can be consistent. The Japanese side has recently shown reluctance to abolish the puppet government of eastern Hebei. This is due to the fact that the puppet government recently sent Ike Zongdai to Changchun to engage in activities and conclude a fake "Military Agreement between Manchuria and Hebei," which is nominally anti-communist, but in reality belongs to a military alliance of offense and defense. The Japanese side intends to use the puppet organization as a shield to prevent communists from entering Manchuria. Before the anti-communist front is determined, seeking to abolish it is still like drawing a cake. On the 21st, the warship "Yodo" of the Japanese naval base in Lushun sailed into Qinhuangdao. On the 24th, three ships, "Kiku," "Ogi," and "Aoi," are planned to sail to Tanggu for temporary guard, with a berthing period of about three weeks. The captains of each ship will be summoned in Tianjin on the 25th by Kubota and Kuwabara, the Japanese naval officers stationed in Beijing and Tianjin, to prepare for anti-communist measures in case of emergency. From this, it can be seen that the anti-communist problem is still in a tense situation.</p>
<p>As for anti-communism in southern Hebei, the Hebei-Chahar authorities have ordered Feng Zhi'an's division to take full responsibility. Zhang Yunrong, commander of the Hebei Provincial Security Force, and Li Jinzao, director of the Education Department, have gone to Daming and other places to inspect military affairs, arrange defense, and investigate education, tracing the origins of communism, by order of Song Zheyuan. Zhang and others convened a meeting of more than a dozen county magistrates in Nanle, Xingtai, and Daming, resolving to carry out the Qingxiang campaign, confiscate civilian guns, and build a bunker for every twenty villages. On our side, we also recognize anti-communism as a major event, and especially as the key to diplomatic resolution. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Speech: The Bright Road for the People of Sichuan, at the Expanded Commemoration Week of the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Chengdu Airmail: Chairman Chiang attended the expanded Commemoration Week of the Sichuan Provincial Party Headquarters on April 20 and gave a speech entitled "The Bright Road for the People of Sichuan." The original text of his speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Fellow comrades, fellow countrymen, it has been a long time since I have seen you all, so today I specially invited you to hold the Prime Minister's Commemoration Week at the Provincial Party Headquarters, taking this opportunity to meet with you and share my thoughts with you. In the past year, whether in society, politics, military affairs, especially in education, there has been more order and more organization, and it has been able to gradually get on the right track and achieve great progress. Fellow comrades in this area may not feel the great progress you have made yourselves, but people from outside, especially I, have seen clearly the situation before and after this trip to Sichuan, separated by half a year from last spring. We often do not understand our own affairs, but outsiders are very clear. The recent situation in Sichuan is also like this. Now Sichuan has made great progress in all aspects and achieved considerable results. For example, the order of society, the discipline of the army, and the spirit and physique of teachers and students in general have all made great progress compared to before. This is the point that makes me most gratified, and it can also be told to all comrades that we can know that our efforts in the past year have not been without value. If we have one point of effort, we have one point of success, and if we have one point of spirit, we have one point of career. As long as we can invigorate our spirit and work hard, we will surely achieve the goal of revolutionary nation-building. If we do not progress, we will regress, and if we progress, we will surely succeed. The progress of Sichuan this year is of course the result of the efforts of the Sichuan government authorities, from Chairman Liu down to all comrades. At the same time, the efforts of all teachers in the education community and the general party members have also had a great impact, because the education community and the comrades in the party headquarters are the liaison between the government and the people. If the comrades in the party headquarters and the education community do not work hard, it will be difficult for the government and the people to unite sincerely and fight together, and we will not be able to achieve such great progress as we have now. From this, we can better recognize that whether it is personal, social, or especially the entire national cause, it can only be successful if everyone is of one mind and makes concerted efforts. At the same time, those who bear the responsibility of leadership must also know that as long as we can truly invigorate our spirit and work hard, our children, subordinates, students, and the general public in society will surely follow suit and strive hard. In this way, not only can individuals succeed in their careers, but the happiness of the whole family, the whole school, the whole society, and even the whole country can be created by our hands. Therefore, we do not think that the power of individuals is very small, and it does not matter even if we work hard. We must know that the spread of the Tao is faster than the post, and the broadcast of virtue is without limit. Therefore, although the power of individuals is small, its impact is really very great. To the extreme, one person can be invigorated and the world will be male. Therefore, although we do not feel the achievements of our past year's efforts, if we continue day by day, we can carry it forward and make it great, and there will surely be a trend of rapid progress. This is what everyone should strive to invigorate, strengthen themselves, continue to work hard, be consistent from beginning to end, and complete everyone's responsibilities.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding my hopes for Sichuan and the responsibilities that the people of Sichuan should fulfill, I have repeatedly explained to you all last year, so I will not say much today. In general, everyone already knows that Sichuan is naturally the only base for our national revival. The major responsibility of the people of Sichuan is here. The future eternal glory of the people of Sichuan is also here. Our nation is so weak and the country is so dangerous. If we can lead from Sichuan in the future, so that the country can be unified and united as a whole, and our nation can quickly turn danger into safety and weakness into strength, how great will be the merits and glory of the people of Sichuan in the future? This responsibility of saving the country and reviving the nation must be borne by the 400 million compatriots across the country this year. However, with all the unique advantages of Sichuan, especially with the diligence, intelligence, vigor, and spirit of the people of Sichuan, we must take more responsibility for the country and the nation, so as not to fail the expectations of heaven and earth, parents, and the national government, and not to be ashamed of being a modern citizen. How can we shoulder the responsibility of saving the country and reviving the nation, achieve the final successful goal, and create a permanent glorious history? The most important thing is to have a common goal, and then everyone can work hard towards this goal, so that we can unite our spirit, concentrate our strength, and achieve the goal of success. What is the common goal of our national people's efforts now? Of course, it is the Three Principles of the People of the Prime Minister. If we want to create a prosperous country and a strong nation, and restore our inherent territory and carry forward the glory of history, we can only realize the Three Principles of the People if the whole country is of one mind and works together. However, the Three Principles of the People is only a common goal of effort, and it is still abstract. If we want to achieve this goal, we must also have a clear path, that is, we must have a guiding principle and a successful foundation to complete the revolution, and then all our efforts can be twice the result with half the effort, and the work of saving the country and reviving the nation can be accelerated and completed as soon as possible. The revolutionary work in Sichuan in the past year is to eliminate the Red bandits and stabilize society, and in the future, we must further improve politics and work hard to build, and we must make the cause greater and increase the efficiency of our work, so we must especially know the foundation of the cause, the standard of effort, and the path to realize the doctrine. What is this foundation? It is the inherent morality of our nation. Everyone must recognize that if we want to understand the reason why the country becomes rich and strong, we must first know the reason why the country is chaotic and poor. Where is this reason? Fundamentally speaking, it is due to the decline of national morality. Because people's morality has declined, they have no spirit. If they have no spirit, they become soulless bodies, lifeless puppets, or even bandits, thieves, traitors, or opium addicts, becoming beasts without etiquette, righteousness, and shame. This kind of people cannot be human beings at all, let alone save the country. Therefore, if the national morality of a country declines, the country will be chaotic and poor, and foreigners will come to invade. Now foreigners are insulting and oppressing us, not because we have no guns and cannons, no army. Our guns, cannons and armies are too many, so they definitely do not bully us for not having guns and cannons, but bully us for not having the spirit and morality to use guns and cannons. Because we have no spirit and morality, the more troops and guns we have, the easier it is for them to invade. When foreigners have troops and guns, they can protect the country and the people, but when we have troops and guns, we turn around and harm the country and the people. Why is this? It is because the general soldiers of our China do not know their responsibilities, have no spirit and morality, only know selfishness and self-interest, regardless of the country's peril and the people's suffering. Everyone should know that in history, why could our ancestors establish the country for 5,000 years, and at that time, they were strong and great, and there was more and more? It is because we Chinese have a highest and greatest spirit and morality, that is, selflessness, harming oneself to benefit others. From personal exchanges to international exchanges, we all talk about benevolence, store loyalty and honesty, restrain ourselves to love others, and treat others generously and treat ourselves modestly. Especially when the country is in danger and compatriots are in distress, the general public can regard death as home, sacrifice everything of their own, to save the country and the people, without caring at all. Only in this way can our country and nation be able to extend and develop, have such a vast territory, a large population, and the highest moral culture, and a long and glorious history. From this, we can know that the rise and fall of a country and a nation depends entirely on the growth and decline of spirit and morality. The amount of moral spirit is really powerful. If we want to save the country and revive the nation, we must first restore our inherent spirit and morality, and restoring spirit and morality is just a matter of turning our minds. As long as our inherent morality can be truly revived and restored, so that 400 million compatriots across the country can love each other, unite as one, and be able to stand on their own, foreigners will dare not not respect us, and in the near future, we will surely succeed in becoming a top-ranking power in the world.</p>
<p>Just now, I have explained that the fundamental task of saving the country and reviving the nation is to restore our inherent spirit and morality, but the two words "morality" are very broad, so the Fifth National Congress of our party last year especially stipulated the twelve articles of the party members' code of conduct, which specifically and clearly indicated the content of the standard of morality, calling on all our party members to first practice it themselves. In fact, these twelve articles of the code of conduct are the basic cultivation that ordinary people should have, not only should party members abide by them, but all citizens of the Republic of China, regardless of which sector they belong to in the military, political, or education fields, should firmly abide by them. Therefore, today I will first read the original text of the party members' code of conduct, and then explain it one by one. (Everyone stands at attention) The Code of Conduct for Members of the Chinese Kuomintang: Loyalty and bravery are the foundation of patriotism; Filial piety and obedience are the foundation of governing the family; Benevolence and love are the foundation of dealing with things; Faithfulness and righteousness are the foundation of establishing a career; Peace is the foundation of dealing with the world; Etiquette is the foundation of governing affairs; Obedience is the foundation of responsibility; Diligence and frugality are the foundation of service; Neatness and cleanliness are the foundation of governing oneself; Helping others is the foundation of happiness; Learning is the foundation of helping the world; Perseverance is the foundation of success.

<h3>Sichuan Province: Relief Efforts Underway for Disaster Areas; Chairman Chiang Inquires About Disaster Conditions with Local Gentry</h3>
<p>Chengdu Air Dispatch: Communist remnants are currently confined to the Fubian, Suijing, Chonghua, and Danba regions bordering Sichuan, Qinghai, Kangding, and Tibet, and a resolution is expected soon. However, disaster has followed on the heels of the pacification of the communist scourge. According to statistics released by the Sichuan Small Relief Affairs Committee on the 14th, the affected areas total 104 counties and four villages. The types of disasters are as follows: Communist disaster: Songpan and 24 other counties and four villages; Drought: Wuxi and 45 other counties; Flood: Guanxian and 5 other counties; Flood and drought: Chengkou and 19 other counties; Communist, flood, and earthquake: Maoxian; Communist, flood, and drought: Youyang; Communist and flood: Xiushan and 2 other counties; Flood, drought, and wind: Ziyang and 3 other counties; Earthquake: Mabian; Wind and hailstorm: Peng'an; Hailstorm: Renshou. The disaster situations in these areas include families starving to death, people eating tree bark and white clay, suicides, and deaths from illness among those displaced by the communist threat. The tragic situation of those trapped in communist-controlled areas need not be described. The National Government is deeply concerned about the disaster in Sichuan. Recently, it allocated one million yuan in pre-sale public bonds, which were entrusted to Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance, to take back and distribute to the Provincial Relief Affairs Committee to handle relief matters. The bonds are currently being pawned by Liu to financial circles for cash. The Relief Committee hopes to get at least 80% of their value, but financial circles are only willing to recognize 70%. Negotiations are ongoing. While the funds have not yet been borrowed, the Provincial Relief Committee has first raised 100,000 yuan, which has already been allocated. The relief method involves dividing the disaster-stricken counties and villages into seven districts, with one director for grain distribution and one director for relief in each district, and one special commissioner in each county and village to be responsible for implementation. As for relief supplies, the focus is on seeds to be distributed to the disaster-stricken people for timely cultivation. For extremely poor households, emergency relief will still be provided, with a reasonable amount of food assistance. Chairman Chiang arrived in Chengdu by plane on the 17th. On the 19th, he summoned the gentry of Chengdu at the military academy to inquire about the situation in the disaster areas and relief matters. The chairman of the Provincial Relief Committee, Yi Changling, reported on the situation and presented three photos of disaster victims recently sent from Fujian. One showed people stripping and eating tree bark, one showed people forcibly swallowing white clay to fill their stomachs, and one showed a family where all members except two children had starved to death, their corpses lying scattered, a truly tragic scene. After reading, Chiang expressed deep sympathy. Yi further stated that the disaster area was extremely large and the relief funds were insufficient for distribution, requesting an increase. Chiang indicated that he would actively seek ways to provide disaster relief. The gentry thanked him and withdrew. (April 20)</p>
<h3>Jin-Sui Army Generals Voluntarily Donate Salaries to Aid Military Expenses; All Officers Above the Rank of Colonel Are Subject to Deductions; Yan Immediately Replied with Approval for Implementation</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Since the start of the anti-communist military campaign in Shanxi Province, revenues have sharply decreased and military expenditures have been enormous, causing financial difficulties. The entire senior leadership of the Jin-Sui Army, including Sun Chu, Fu Zuoyi, and others, recently jointly telegraphed Yan, volunteering to have the salaries of all officers above the rank of colonel deducted, starting in March, in accordance with the method of salary deductions for public officials in various agencies during the anti-communist period, to help meet military needs. After receiving the telegram, Yan was very pleased and immediately replied separately with commendations, agreeing to the request. The original telegrams are recorded as follows: Telegram from the Generals: "Director Yan: We have observed that since the start of the anti-communist military campaign, military expenses have increased sharply, while revenues have decreased, causing financial difficulties. We understand that you are working tirelessly, sharing the people's suffering, and considering the difficulties of your subordinates, planning meticulously in every way. Although we are in the military, we can only obey orders to kill the enemy to repay your kindness. However, we are always mindful of your worries. The recent temporary donation measures for personnel in various agencies during the anti-communist period, issued by your office, exempt the anti-communist troops, showing your utmost concern for your subordinates, which deeply inspires all officers and soldiers. However, we believe that the officers of the various units have followed you for many years, sharing weal and woe, and having received your nurturing grace, how can we not have the will to repay it? We have repeatedly received requests from officers at all levels that during this difficult time, they are willing to sacrifice everything in order to contribute to overcoming the current difficulties. They wish to donate funds in the same way as personnel in various agencies, to express their humble intention of loving the country. Furthermore, considering that the salaries of junior officers below the rank of major are not high, it seems appropriate to uphold your intentions and exempt them from donating. Senior officers above the rank of colonel have more substantial salaries, and we propose that they all donate according to regulations. In this way, the officers of the various units can both feel your concern and express their love for the country. We respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. Yours respectfully, Sun Chu, Fu Zuoyi, Zhou Dai, Zhao Chengshou, Yang Chengyuan, Yang Xiaoou, Li Shengda, Yang Yaofang, Li Fuying, Wang Jingguo, Du Chunyi, Fu Xiangchuai, Lu Pengzhu, together kowtow." Yan's reply telegram: "Taiyuan Suiyi Public Office telegram to Fenyang Commander Sun, Suiyuan Army Commander Fu, Taiyuan Commander Zhou, Datong Commander Zhao, Linfen Division Commander Yang, Pingyao Division Commander Yang, Fenyang Division Commander Li, Division Commander Yang, Yanggao Division Commander Li, Taiyuan Division Commander Wang, Brigade Commander Du, Taigu Acting Brigade Commander Lu, Your telegrams have been received. This time, the communists have invaded western Shanxi. You have bravely fought against the insurgents, showing loyalty to the Party and the country, and starting with the sacrifice of officers above the rank of colonel, and following the example of personnel in various agencies donating their salaries, which is highly commendable. Your request should be approved. Deductions should be made starting in March. In addition to separate telegrams, please be informed. Yan Baoxu seal."</p>
<h3>Northeastern Fujian: Remnant Bandits Have Nowhere to Run; Gao Chengxue's Group Has Surrendered and Been Reorganized</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Huang Ligui faction of the pseudo-Fujian East Independent Division has been rampaging in Shouting and Jian'ou counties in northeastern Fujian in recent months. They have been repeatedly defeated by pursuing troops. Recently, they regrouped several hundred remnants and fled to the border of Zhenghe and Songxi counties, attempting to prolong their survival. Recently, the 56th Division and the New 11th Division dispatched teams to attack from both sides, and the bandits were unable to advance or retreat. They then fled from Zhenghe to the northwest area of Pingnan, seeking to invade Shouning. The supplementary regiment of the 9th Division stationed in eastern Fujian and the 3rd Security Regiment have stationed troops on the border of Pingshou, launching a head-on attack on the bandits. The Tian battalion of the 56th Division stationed in Jian'ou and the 4th Security Regiment stationed in Pingnan are also advancing to encircle and suppress the bandits. Therefore, the border of Zheng, Shou, Ping, and Jian counties has been the scene of fierce fighting for several days. The bandits have suffered heavy losses at the hands of the National Army. According to a certain officer of the 4th Pacification Zone Headquarters, Huang's bandits have suffered repeated heavy blows, and their elite troops have been almost entirely lost. They have no combat capability. This time, feeling the severe threat of the pursuing troops in northern Fujian and unable to establish a foothold, they returned to eastern Fujian, aiming to seize food. All units have now surrounded them, and it is expected that they will be wiped out in a short time.</p>
<p>The pseudo-Fujian North Independent Wang Dao faction, which operates in Chong'an, Pucheng, Guangze, and Shaowu counties, was originally in contact with Huang Ligui. After being cut off by the bandit suppression troops, their strength became isolated. They have been lurking in the mountains of Chong'an and Pucheng counties for a long time without any news. Recently, taking advantage of the troop movements on the Fujian-Zhejiang border, they fled from the Chongpu border to the area where Pucheng and Longquan meet. Because the terrain there is complex, they want to use it as a base to gather followers. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters on the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi border has ordered the 45th Division to guard the Pucheng area and the 11th Division to guard the Longquan area, and has also dispatched teams to search and suppress the bandits, so that they have nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>The pirates on the islands off the coast of eastern Fujian, numbering several hundred with their weapons, have been repeatedly suppressed by the navy, army, police, and security forces, and their situation is dire. Realizing that a life of piracy is not a good plan in the end, they sent people to the Pacification Commissioner's Office to request reorganization, which has been approved. Now they are mainly concentrated in the Su'ao area of Haitan Island, waiting to be inspected. However, it has not yet been decided whether to reorganize them into a water police force or a security force. The leader, Gao Chengxue, is also tired of his old ways and plans to be given 10,000 yuan by the authorities to study in Japan. However, Nanri Island, the fishing center of eastern Fujian, now has a special district office established by the provincial government. Because of years of pirate harassment, all fishing boats and nets have been robbed, leaving the fishermen with no means of livelihood. Recently, the provincial government received a report from the district office of the island that because the fishermen have lost their livelihoods, many have been selling their wives and children for grain in recent months. Many who have no wives and children to sell, unable to bear the hunger, have committed suicide by starvation. It is truly tragic. (April 22)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province: Aviation Construction Movement; Raising Funds to Purchase Five Aircraft to Celebrate Birthday; Opening Two Domestic Air Routes; Conducting Air Defense Exercises Along the Coast</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Fujian Province has recently made rapid progress in aviation construction. The first membership drive of the Aviation Construction Association ended at the end of March. Over 50,000 members were obtained, and membership fees reached over 120,000 yuan. A fundraising event is currently being held to purchase aircraft to celebrate a birthday. It is generally divided into four groups: the public, students, gentry and merchants, and overseas Chinese. In terms of the public, the provincial branch and the southern and northern Fujian sub-branches will work hard to raise funds within the scope of the public, and the provincial recruitment headquarters will be responsible for handling it. In terms of students, the director of the Department of Education will actively raise funds within the scope of students in various cities and counties. In terms of gentry and merchants, three people, namely the gentry Sa Zhenbing, Luo Mianhou, and Chen Peikun, will serve as the captains of the special fundraising team for gentry and merchants, and will do their best to raise funds from all sectors of the gentry and merchants in the province. In terms of overseas Chinese, Hu Wenhu, Chen Jiageng, Li Qingquan, and others will serve as the captains of the special fundraising team for overseas Chinese, and will do their best to raise funds from overseas compatriots. The association is currently stepping up the printing of tens of thousands of donation booklets, which should be distributed separately within a few days. According to the person in charge of the association, it is estimated that five birthday aircraft can be raised in this province. In addition, the Provincial Aviation Association also plans to allocate a portion of the membership fees recently raised to purchase two civil aircraft to open domestic air routes. Taking Fuzhou as the main station, the first route will start from Fuzhou, passing through Shuikou, Yanping, Jian'ou, Shaowu, and ending at Pucheng, called the Fupu Line. The second route will start from Fuzhou, passing through Xianyou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Longyan, and ending at Changting, called the Futing Line. Each will run three times a week. It is expected that preparations can begin around July of this year. At the same time, in order to instill air defense knowledge in the public, the provincial government has also decided to hold one air defense exercise in each of the important coastal cities of the province. The provincial capital has been scheduled for the end of May. A preparatory committee has been formed by the Security Department, the Public Security Bureau, the Department of Education, the Fire Fighting Federation, the Medical Association, and other agencies and organizations to actively prepare. The planned budget is 20,000 yuan. The exercises are divided into four types: rescue, alarm, fire fighting, and defense. The preparatory committee will proceed in three steps: investigation, organization, and training. The investigation has now been completed. It is estimated that there are more than 30 public and private hospitals and over 400 nurses in the rescue field. In the fire fighting field, there are 34 fire brigades and over 3,000 firefighters. As for the alarm and defense aspects, the military police and students of the provincial capital will be responsible. After the investigation is completed, preparation is underway. Once the preparation is completed, training will begin. Aircraft for the exercise have been borrowed from the Central Aviation Administration. The Wangzhuang Airport will be used as the aviation station. Construction has been ordered and is expected to be completed within a week.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Recovered Areas: Fields and Land are Desolate and Uncultivated; Zhejiang to Immigrate People to Jiangxi to Reclaim Wasteland</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The districts in Jiangxi Province that were recovered are extremely dilapidated, and the population mortality rate is also high. To this day, they are still extremely desolate. For example, in Ruijin and Ningdu counties, the Baozheng labor is used to cultivate wasteland. Anyone who cultivates wasteland is exempt from rent for three years. Also, in Shangrao, Dexing, Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Guixi counties in Guangxin, fertile fields have become overgrown with weeds, and the boundaries of fields and roads cannot be distinguished. In the area from Yiyang to Hetanbu, less than one-tenth of the dozens of miles of wasteland is cultivated. The situation in counties such as Tonggu, Lianhua, Ninggang, and Dexing is largely similar. The biggest reason is that the landlords have died or fled, resulting in fertile land with no one to cultivate it. The former provisional headquarters had a plan to immigrate people for land reclamation, but it ultimately failed to materialize due to economic and other reasons. After the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, there was a surge of voices calling for immigration from Zhejiang along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway into Jiangxi. It is now known that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to immigrate people to Shangrao, Yushan, Hengfeng, Dexing, Guixi, Qianshan, Yiyang, Lianhua, Taihe, Suichuan, and Anfou, to reclaim barren mountains and uncultivated fields, and restore cultivation, to prevent goods from being abandoned on the land. It is said that it is currently seeking the consent of Jiangxi Province to begin investigations and develop a comprehensive plan. (April 21)</p>
<h3>Wuhu-Tunxi Telephone Officially Opens for Business</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Of the trunk lines in Anhui Province for the Nine-Province long-distance telephone network, the Jing-Wu section was completed long ago, and the original telephone line has been replaced with a new line. The two sections from Wuhu to Datong and from Datong to Anqing are currently being constructed by employees dispatched by the Ministry of Communications. They are connecting with Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province to establish communication as soon as possible. The Wuhu-Tunxi branch line has been under construction for five months, with a total length of 269 kilometers. It was completely completed a few days ago. Yesterday, the Wuhu Telegraph Bureau conducted a trial call with various bureaus and offices along the line. As a result, the sound was clear and the results were good. In order to facilitate communication and benefit the public, it has been decided to officially open for business tomorrow (the 24th). Currently, the locations that can be reached by phone are Wuhu, Xuancheng, Ningguo, Jixi, Shexian, Gaochun, Dangtu, Shuiyang, Shuidong, Guangde, Gangkou, Qimen, and Yuting. The Tunxi Telegraph Bureau is also testing the sound quality with the Beijing and Shanghai bureaus and adjusting the lines. It is said that Tunxi will be able to communicate with Beijing and Shanghai in the shortest possible time, which will benefit merchants and the public. (April 23)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Kidnapped Victim Escapes in Sijing Case</h3>
<p>Wang Shiyuan, a villager in Xiangze Township, Sijing, Songjiang County, has been diligent and thrifty all his life, accumulating some savings, which attracted the covetousness of bandits. On the night of the 29th of last month, more than ten bandits broke into his home, kidnapped his 14-year-old son, Guizhoulong, and escaped with stolen goods. Afterwards, the victim entrusted people to search everywhere for rescue, but there was no news. Later, a letter came from the bandits demanding a ransom, but there was no accurate location, and no contact could be made. It was not until 3:00 AM on the night of April 17th that Guizhoulong took the opportunity to escape while the bandits were asleep. After walking for about an hour, dawn broke, and he asked a vendor for directions, who told him that he could reach Xujing, Qingpu, thirty li to the west. When he arrived at his destination, he hired a boat home. His family was overjoyed and reported the incident to the Fifth Police Station.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Tan Zhuohong's Dereliction of Duty Case Opens for Trial</h3>
<p>Tan Zhuohong, a judge of the Shanghai District Court, is 39 years old and a native of Taishan County, Guangdong. Someone secretly reported to the Ministry of Justice that he had colluded with lawyer Yang Shaopeng in the handling of cases such as "Zhang Qidong and others suing Song Dazheng for defamation," "Qin, the owner of the Haizhou steamer, causing death through negligence," "Lei Yunsheng Pharmacy suing Wang Bingnan for trademark forgery," "Wu Peizhen suing Li Keting for hindering marriage," and "Cheng Tianzhi suing Xu Yi for document forgery," soliciting bribes from the parties involved. The court ordered the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court to investigate, reply, detain, and the High Court transferred the case to the Wuxian District Court for trial. After Tan and Yang were escorted to Suzhou from Shanghai, Zhu Shufen, the prosecutor of the Wu District Court, concluded the investigation on the 7th of this month and filed a public prosecution for crimes such as breach of duty. Yu Zhong, the criminal court president of the Wu District Court, scheduled the trial to begin at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 25th). All parties involved have been notified by the District Court through a letter to the Shanghai District Court. The circumstances of the case are complex and involve a wide range, and it is expected that the trial will be lengthy. Tan and Yang have been denied visitors since being escorted to the Wu District Court until yesterday (the 24th), which shows the importance attached to the case by the court.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Rice Mill Dispute Expected to Subside</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the Runfa Rice Mill has not yet been resolved, but after the best efforts of both the Party and the government to mediate, opinions seem to be gradually converging, and a resolution is expected today. As for the strike, the workers resumed work after a three-day work stoppage due to livelihood concerns. However, before the situation was peaceful, the factory shut down the engine room and did not allow the workers to enter the factory. Therefore, various trade unions rose up to assist, and the county government persuaded the capitalists to start the engine. Normal operation has resumed since the 24th. As for Zhang Yinchang and the new workers, negotiations are still underway, and a settlement is generally expected.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Temple Fair Smashes Police Station</h3>
<p>In the third month of the lunar calendar in Wuxi, there is a custom of holding temple fairs during the incense season, which is a way to pray and give thanks. This year, due to the county government's strict prohibition, the fairs in various temples in the city were stopped. However, the enthusiasm in various villages and towns remained undiminished. On the third day of the intercalary third month, villagers in Qianzhou Town in the ninth district of the county held a Meng Jiang Hui fair. They actively prepared in advance, and everything from stilt walkers to floats, gongs, and dances was available. Nearby villages and towns were all in an uproar. On the morning of that day, the incense procession departed from Qianzhou, passed through Xinqiao and She, and arrived at the Jade Emperor Temple on Phoenix Head Mountain in Yuqi to offer incense. The streets were lined with spectators. At 4:00 PM, when the procession passed by the No. 7 Police Station of the Yuqi Public Security Bureau, Patrol Officer Ma Zemin, based on a previous prohibition, immediately sent police officers to stop it. The fair leaders, Jin Quanchang and Ah Gou, were arrested and sentenced to a fine of 15 yuan each. Jin and others were unable to pay, and the general public, seeing the fair leaders being arrested, dispersed hastily. On the one hand, they gathered at the police station to demand their release. The patrol officer refused, and a group of radicals clashed with the guards at the gate, causing the gate and fence to be destroyed. As the number of people gathered increased, Patrol Officer Ma, fearing a major disaster, fired more than ten shots into the sky, injuring a certain person, and telegraphed the county police bureau to send police officers and bullets. Subsequently, the Yuqi Township Office came forward to mediate and bailed out Jin and Zhang. The crowd then dispersed. When the patrol team arrived in the village, they saw that the matter had been resolved and returned to the city.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoon Industry Unifies Cocoon Purchases</h3>
<p>The Wuxi silk factory industry, learning from the successful implementation of unified management of silkworms in Zhejiang, and with silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai having decided to jointly purchase cocoons, requires all silk merchants and surplus cocoon merchants to register with the silkworm unification association before purchasing cocoons. Xue and Qian Fenghao and others, major figures in the silk industry, have decided to jointly purchase this year's spring cocoons to avoid competitive bidding and rising costs. Hua Shaochun, chairman of the Cocoon Industry Association, has been appointed to handle the matter. The dry cocoons received in the future will be evenly distributed to each factory according to its needs. Silk merchants who purchase cocoons in Wuxi must also contact the Cocoon Industry Association. A unified approach will be adopted for cocoon prices to avoid uneven cocoon prices.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Secret Gun Manufacturing Operation Busted</h3>
<p>According to a tip-off, the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police learned that there was a secret gun manufacturing operation in Haixi Township in the Third District of Gaoyou and at the Renqiao area of Wanfu Township in the Sixth District. Patrol Officers Tu Chongyu and Tang Bolong of the district were ordered to head out separately to apprehend the suspects. Two craftsmen inside were taken into custody, along with over 120 gun-making tools and a large number of finished and unfinished firearms. Ten suspects, including the arrested Shen Wen, were brought in for questioning and were escorted to the Provincial Garrison Headquarters yesterday. According to their confession, they were all hired craftsmen, and the organizers, Yang and Yang Zhaoxiang, had fled upon hearing the news. They are currently being pursued.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Wang Boling Resigns from All Positions Due to Parental Mourning</h3>
<p>Madam Cheng, mother of Central Executive Committee member and Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee member Wang Boling, recently suffered from unstable weather conditions and suddenly developed heart failure two weeks ago, which was difficult to treat. She passed away at 11:20 AM on the 23rd at the age of 75. Wang was overcome with grief and immediately telegraphed the Central Executive Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request leave for mourning and urgently telegraphed the President of the Executive Yuan, requesting immediate approval to resign from his position as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government so that he could accompany the spirit and recite scriptures and observe mourning at the tomb. It is reported that the encoffining will take place at 3:00 PM on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Foreigners Invade Wuzhisha to Fish</h3>
<p>Recently, fishing boats from a certain country have been invading the Wuzhisha area in the Dongsha fishing grounds of Nantong to fish. The local fishermen have been greatly affected by this year's yellow croaker season. The situation has been reported to the province and county, requesting measures to stop it.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Township Head Illegally Excavates Ancient Tomb</h3>
<p>In Jiangxi Township, the Fourth District of this county, there is an ancient tomb, believed to be the tomb of "A Dou," the last ruler of the Later Han Dynasty. The tomb area is approximately several acres in size. It has been eroded by the surrounding farmers over the years, and the tomb base has been shrinking, but no one dared to openly excavate it. Unexpectedly, Township Head Yang Huaizhong suddenly led many people to privately excavate the ancient tomb the day before yesterday. Many antiques, such as ancient swords, bronze stoves, and bronze tripods, were unearthed in the tomb, which aroused the public anger of the nearby Liu clan. The Liu clan has now elected several representatives to come to the city to file a complaint with the county government against Township Head Yang for illegally excavating their ancestral tomb, requesting that he be investigated according to law.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Cheng Yuanfan Returned to the Province from Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, went to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Finance on everything related to the issuance of 60 million in government bonds for the province, as well as to make some statements. The case has now been approved by the Executive Yuan. Cheng then transferred to Shanghai to negotiate with banks and obtain funds. The results were satisfactory, and he returned to Hangzhou on the noon express train yesterday (the 24th) to report the progress to Huang Shaohong, chairman of the provincial government.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Bengbu Public Security Bureau Chief He Guoliang Suspended and Placed Under Supervision</h3>
<p>He Guoliang, the Chief of the Bengbu Public Security Bureau, has been in office for nearly three years. The various miscellaneous taxes and levies he imposed were too numerous, which was met with dissatisfaction by local people. After an investigation by personnel sent by the Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy's Office, it was confirmed that He had embezzled tax funds, a major act of corruption. Supervisory Envoy Miao Peicheng, in addition to impeaching him according to law, requested the Anhui Provincial Government by telegram, according to Article 5 of the Supervisory Envoy's Patrol Inspection Regulations, to urgently provide relief measures and first suspend He Guoliang from his duties and place him under supervision, and seal up all funds and books from his tenure, pending legal action. Chairman Liu Zhenhua, considering the seriousness of the case and the fact that He had repeatedly clashed with people's organizations over tax issues, of which he had previously been vaguely aware, secretly telegraphed Lu Zongjing, Chief of the Changhuai Water Police Bureau here, yesterday (the 21st), ordering him to be responsible for supervising He Guoliang and seal up all funds and books from his tenure, pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai, Discusses: Draft Constitution Determined to be Announced as Scheduled; National Water Conservancy Plan Based on Both Symptomatic and Root Cause Treatment; Fiscal Year 25 Revenues and Expenditures Expected to be Balanced; Extension of Legal Tender Exchange Period for Several Months</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, and Hui Yangfu, Vice Minister of Railways, traveled together by night train from Nanjing on the 23rd at 11 p.m. and arrived at the North Station around 7 a.m. on the 24th. After disembarking, Kong returned directly to his private residence on Seymour Road to rest. Later, at noon, he went to the Central Bank to handle important matters. He then met with reporters from various newspapers and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Water Management Plan Treats Both Symptomatic and Root Causes</p>
<p>After the water management agency is directly managed by the National Economic Council, it will utilize domestic and foreign technical experts to comprehensively plan. This year's national water conservancy plan will address both the symptoms and root causes. The plugging of the Dongzhuang breach has now been completed. For water conservancy along the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, in addition to dredging river channels to facilitate water flow, *palms will also be planted upstream, as this type of plant grows very quickly and is more effective than afforestation. The riverbanks will be heightened, and the responsible authorities in each province will be ordered to dig ditches to utilize natural water volume to irrigate farmland. At the same time, the Economic Council has established a laboratory to conduct experiments using scientific methods and to adopt the experience of river management from the past to suit our country's national conditions.</p>
<p>Draft Constitution Slightly Revised</p>
<p>Regarding the revision of the draft constitution, the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee has completed its deliberation on the 23rd, taking into account opinions from all parties. The original draft has been slightly revised. After it is sent to the Legislative Yuan for textual editing, it will be announced as scheduled on May 5th and submitted for discussion when the National Assembly is convened.</p>
<p>National General Budget for Fiscal Year 25</p>
<p>The national general budget for the twenty-fifth fiscal year has been decided in principle. Various departments and commissions are currently preparing budget documents in accordance with this principle. Revenues and expenditures are expected to be balanced.</p>
<p>Legal Tender Exchange Period to be Extended Again</p>
<p>The extension of the legal tender exchange period for three months will expire on May 3rd. However, in remote provinces and areas where the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have not yet established branches, legal tender has not yet been circulated smoothly. To safeguard the interests of the people in the border areas, we are currently studying alternative measures and will extend the period for several months, he said.</p>
<h3>Second International Social Policy Conference to be Held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on October 1st This Year</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Second International Social Policy Conference is scheduled to be held in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, from October 1st to 4th this year. Experts in social policy from around the world are invited to participate. A Central News Agency reporter recently inquired with the China Branch of the International Labour Office for further details, as follows:</p>
<p>Initiated Twelve Years Ago</p>
<p>The International Social Policy Conference was initiated twelve years ago by Albert Thomas, the former Director-General of the International Labour Office, and leaders of various international organizations studying social issues. The first International Social Policy Conference was held in Prague, discussing "Statements on the International Situation in the Field of Social Policy" and "Definitions of the Main Principles of New Social Policy," including (A) the social and moral results of the eight-hour workday (the development of workers' spiritual life), (B) worker participation in industrial management, and (C) the obligations of society in response to labor crises. As a result of this conference, various international organizations studying social issues, such as the "International Association for Labor Legislation," the "International Association Against Unemployment," and the "International Social Insurance Conference," were merged to form the "International Association for Social Progress" in 1925.</p>
<p>Agenda of This Year's Conference</p>
<p>Recently, in response to the earnest requests of the Czech government and various social organizations in that country, it was decided to convene the Second Conference in Prague again, scheduled to be held from October 1st to 4th, 1936, to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the founding conference. The conference agenda has been determined: 1. The issue of domestic and international credit controls for the benefit of society; 2. The issue of the freedom of trade unions and professional worker organizations. The presidium of the conference preparatory committee includes Godefroy, the former French Minister of Labor, Albert Thomas, the Director-General of the International Labour Office, and Xiong Bang, the Director of the Czech Social Research Institute. They have now sent letters to those in our country who have studied social policy, inviting them to participate.</p>
<p>Two Meetings Before the Opening</p>
<p>It is also reported that before the opening of the Second International Social Policy Conference, the "General Assembly of Disease Insurance Organizations" and the "International Industrial Relations Association" will be held from September 28th to 30th to discuss economic planning issues. Therefore, those who participate in these two conferences will have the opportunity to attend the Second International Social Policy Conference. Those who wish to know the details of this conference can inquire at the China Branch of the International Labour Office on Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Philippine Chinese Overseas Inspection Group to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; Representatives from All Sectors in Shanghai Will Welcome Them at the Port; Inspect the City and Visit Local Leaders</h3>
<p>The Philippine Chinese Overseas Inspection Group of twenty people, led by Wang Quansheng, member of the Central Executive Committee and head of the group, is returning to China to inspect the motherland's enterprises. They arrived in Hong Kong on the 16th of this month and traveled to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces for inspection. It is now learned that they left Hong Kong yesterday by ship for Shanghai and are scheduled to arrive at the port tomorrow. Representatives from all sectors in Shanghai will welcome them at the port. Here are the details from the Shun Pao News Agency:</p>
<p>All Sectors in Shanghai Welcome Them Tomorrow</p>
<p>After arriving in Hong Kong by ship from the Philippines on the 16th of this month, the group toured for three days and then left Hong Kong for Guangzhou on the 19th, transferring to Wuzhou to visit important figures in the Southwest and visit various construction projects and major factories. They have now returned to Hong Kong and left Hong Kong yesterday again, led by Wang Quansheng, member of the Central Executive Committee and head of the group, on the American President Lines' President Grant for Shanghai. They are scheduled to arrive at the port tomorrow. Party and government agencies and business groups in Shanghai believe that the group is concerned about the motherland's enterprises and has made the long journey to return to China for inspection, which shows their enthusiasm. Therefore, they will send representatives to the port to warmly welcome them and plan to hold receptions separately after the group arrives in Shanghai in order to learn about the recent situation of overseas Chinese in the Philippines and the trade situation between China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Visit Leaders and Inspect the City</p>

<h3>Five-Bank Syndicate Handles Cocoon Purchasing and Lending; Lending Started Yesterday; Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Association Scheduled to Meet on the 26th; Silk Filatures Continue to Purchase Cocoons as Usual</h3>
<p>The five-bank syndicate, including the Bank of China, is handling a 20 million yuan loan for cocoon purchasing. The banks have already discussed the lending method on the 23rd and started lending that day. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk cocoon manufacturers are scheduled to meet in Hangzhou on the 26th to discuss the allocation of this year's spring cocoon purchasing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lending Begins</p>
<p>The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank have formed a five-bank syndicate to provide loans for silk cocoons, with a fixed amount of 20 million yuan, which will be lent to various silk cocoon filatures. In order to implement this loan, the banks convened a meeting of the borrowing banks at 2 p.m. on the 23rd at the Bank of China to discuss the lending method. The lending officially started that day. The interest rate is 8.5% to 8.75%, with all the cocoons received by the factories as collateral, it is said.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Meeting</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Filature Association is scheduled to hold a meeting in Hangzhou on the 26th, inviting representatives from silk filatures in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places to attend and jointly discuss the allocation method for this year's cocoon purchasing. It is now learned that the silk industry has appointed Chu Huiseng, Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Xiufang, and others to take a train to Hangzhou tomorrow night to attend the meeting and participate in the discussions.</p>
<p>Cocoon Purchasing Registration</p>
<p>Regarding the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Cocoon Control Committee's closing of cocoon purchasing registration on April 15th, manufacturers, due to insufficient raw materials, sent representatives to Hangzhou to petition. According to Chu Huiseng, a leader in the silk industry, the Zhejiang Control Committee has closed the registration for manufacturers who directly purchase cocoons from the people. However, silk filatures are not restricted due to raw material concerns, and factories can continue to purchase cocoons as usual, it is said.</p>
<h3>After the Suspension of Exchange by Foreign Tea Brokers, Tea Trading is in a Slump, Affecting International Trade and Workers' Livelihoods; Anhui Control Committee to Establish a Sales Group in Shanghai</h3>
<p>New Voices News Agency reports: Fourteen foreign tea brokers, including Zhongxin Chang, who were responsible for the transportation and sale of Anhui's Qimen tea under the province's control, suspended exchange on the morning of the day before yesterday, causing the export trade of black and green tea to stall, affecting foreign trade and the livelihoods of tea-making workers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Broker Loans</p>
<p>The method of tea purchasing by foreign tea brokers (tea trading companies) has always been to provide loans to various tea houses, which then purchase tea leaves from tea farmers. All tea leaves purchased by these tea houses from tea farmers are sold by the tea brokers who provided the loans, and then sold to foreign firms in Shanghai for export. The tea broker loan method uses the amount of tea purchased by the tea house as the standard, paying a certain amount of cash in advance and a certain amount of promissory notes. These promissory notes are accepted upon maturity. The interest rate on the loans ranges from 1% to 1.5% per month. The so-called suspension of exchange by the Foreign Tea Brokers Association means that they will not accept the promissory notes, even if they have matured.</p>
<p>Trade Stalls</p>
<p>China's tea exports amount to approximately 30 million yuan per year, with Qimen black tea accounting for the majority. Now that the foreign tea brokers have suspended exchange, all transactions have stalled. Fortunately, it is currently the off-season, so the losses to the tea brokers are still light. If the situation is not resolved in ten days, the tea brokers, tea houses, and tea farmers will suffer great losses, which will have a significant impact on international trade. This is because new tea from various parts of Anhui will be on the market at that time. After tea farmers pick the tea, they will hand it over to tea houses for processing and transportation to Shanghai, where it will be sold to foreign firms for export by the tea brokers. Now, due to the suspension of exchange of promissory notes, tea houses will inevitably stop delivering goods to tea brokers, and tea brokers will be unable to trade.</p>
<p>Workers Confer</p>
<p>There are approximately 1,200 tea-making workers employed by tea brokers in Shanghai, who pack the processed tea into boxes and sell it to foreign firms for export. However, most of the tea is green tea, and black tea accounts for very little. As for Qimen black tea, it is processed by tea-making workers in various tea houses in Anhui Province and then transported to Shanghai, where it is packed into boxes by Shanghai tea-making workers and sold directly to foreign firms by the tea brokers, commonly known as "road brokers." After the foreign tea brokers suspended exchange, the livelihoods of tea-making workers were greatly affected. The Shanghai Tea-Making Industry Union also held a meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Establish a Sales Group</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government established the Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee to control the transportation and sale of Qimen tea and decided to establish a sales group in Shanghai. The province has appointed Cao to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment, who will soon come to Shanghai from Anhui. Because tea brokers and tea houses always exploit tea farmers with high interest rates, the provincial government has reached an agreement with the banking community, with the Bank of Communications providing 800,000 yuan and the Anhui-Jiangxi Local Bank providing 250,000 yuan each, for a total of 1.3 million yuan, to provide loans directly to tea houses. The interest rate is 8% to 10% per month, which is lower than the interest rate on loans from tea brokers. Now, the provincial government has gradually implemented this, and tea houses have also accepted the loans.</p>
<p>Kong's Talk</p>
<p>When Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi met with the press corps at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon, he talked about the Anhui Province's control of black tea transportation and sales. He said that Anhui's control of the tea industry is actually to balance production and sales, so as not to cause oversupply and harm farmers and merchants, and to improve the quality so that domestic tea will not be excluded from the international market due to poor quality. Therefore, the purpose is completely the same as the control of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Tea merchants believe that the government is competing with the people for profit, which is a misunderstanding, he said.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Finance Director Cheng Yuanfan Returns to Hangzhou; No Negotiations for Loan Collateralized by Public Bonds This Time</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province is reorganizing its local public bonds and issuing new bonds worth 60 million yuan. However, after exchanging the old bonds for new ones, there is still a surplus of 10 million yuan. Therefore, the Zhejiang Finance Department plans to mortgage the bonds to banks in Shanghai for 6 million yuan at 60% of their face value. Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, visited Kong Xiangxi in Nanjing the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai, staying at a friend's house on Yuyuan Road. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited him yesterday, but Cheng had already returned to Hangzhou by train from Shanghai at 8 a.m. It is reported that Cheng did not mention the matter of mortgaging the remaining public bonds to the banking community during his passage through Shanghai. As for the banks' response, it is said that if there are reliable guarantees, banks are inherently engaged in deposit and loan business. Even if there is a public bond mortgage, it is not impossible. Although Zhejiang Province once discussed a mortgage before, Cheng did not raise the matter during his visit to Shanghai. Therefore, the issues of interest and term of the mortgage guarantee are being discussed by both parties, and the distribution of the amount among the various banks has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Four More Overseas Chinese Deported from Japan Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Four more overseas Chinese deported from Japan arrived in Shanghai on the Tsukuba Maru the day before yesterday. Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sent a special representative to the wharf to take care of them and register their names. They are: Liu Baoxian, 40 years old, who lived in Japan for ten years and worked as a porter in Oshima Town, Koto Ward, Tokyo; Tong Youyao, 37 years old, who lived in Japan for twelve years and also worked as a porter in Oshima Town, Koto Ward, Tokyo; Jin Benyuan, 34 years old, who lived in Japan for twelve years and worked as a porter in Horie Town, Central Ward, Nagoya. All of the above are from Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province. Zhang Yongyi, who lived in Japan for eleven years and ran a restaurant in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, is from Jinan, Shandong Province. The above-mentioned returning overseas Chinese have been sent back to their hometowns by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon.</p>

Yesterday at 9:45 AM, they boarded the Italian ship "Conte Verde" to attend the conference. Over a thousand people came to see them off, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Seeing Off the Representatives</p>
<p>Many people went to the wharf to see them off, including Mayor Wu, Du Yuesheng, Yu Hongjun, Yang Dezhao, Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Haifeng, Tang Shixuan, Geng Jiaji, Zhang Yuanruo, Chu Huiseng, Wang Changchun, Shen Junru, Ren Jinpin, Lu Jingshi, Jin Tingsun, Zhou Yu, Zhao Tiezhang, Lin Kanghou, Tang Xuzhi, Zhu Dongshan, Wang Zhisheng, Li Dachao, Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Zha Peilin, Ye Xianggao, Lu Muqin, Hu Qi, Yang Zhonghan, Wang Jiyi, Yang Ruisheng, Cheng Yongming, etc., as well as representatives from the Municipal General Labor Union, Shipping and Carpentry Union, Hotel and Hospitality Union, Stevedores' Mutual Aid Association, Shipbuilding Union, National Postal Workers' Union, Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Gangpian (a type of labor) Union, Rice Cart Union, Newspaper Union, First District Cosmetics Union, Fifth District Cigarette Union, First District Water and Electricity Union, Public Bus Drivers' Union, Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union, Military Uniform Union, Fifth District Cotton Spinning Union, Fifth District Civilian Boat Shoulder Carriers' Union, Toothpaste Container Union, Mercerized Dyeing Union, Fifth District Paper Making Union, Sauce Industry Union, Tenth District Cotton Spinning Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Sixth District Water and Electricity Union, Sixth District Silk Reeling Union, Chinese Seamen's Union, Commercial Transportation Union Association, New Jardine Matheson Stevedoring Department, China Merchants Stevedoring Office, Jardine Matheson Stevedoring Department, Beijun'an Sailors' Guild, Jianghai Steamship Middle Cabin Guild, Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch, Seamen's Third District Branch, Labor Movement Personnel Training Institute, Yan Ying General Association, Yi She, Minli Middle School, Yangjian Elementary School, etc., totaling more than 1,500 people.</p>
<p>Boarding the Ship</p>
<p>The send-off party arrived at the China Merchants Bureau North Bund Wharf before 8:00 AM. There were hundreds of flags of various sizes, with the words "Seeing Off Labor Representative Mr. Zhu Xuefan and Maritime Representative Mr. Zhao Banfu" written on them in black characters on white cloth, clearly visible in the air. The morning began with a light rain, but it soon cleared up, and the send-off party was extremely enthusiastic. At 9:00 AM, both representatives, Zhu and Zhao, arrived at the wharf, and people from all sides came forward to shake their hands. After exchanging greetings with representatives from all walks of life, Zhu and Zhao boarded the ship to rest.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Departure</p>
<p>At 9:45 AM, the Italian ship began to set sail. The send-off party said their farewells and disembarked. At this time, the Postal Workers' Union band played music to see them off, while other workers set off firecrackers to show their respect. The music and firecrackers filled the air. More than 200 people from the Towing Industry Union and Yi She also boarded small municipal ferries No. 5 and No. 6, following the Italian ship to see it off, returning only outside Wusongkou. Wusong Municipal Commissioner Tang Xuzhi also rushed to Wusong, leading representatives from various groups in Wusong, waiting at Wusongkou and setting off firecrackers to see off the Italian ship as it passed.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu made a statement to reporters on the ship, saying, "The 20th International Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva on June 1st. I am honored to be appointed as a representative to attend, but I feel ashamed of my limited abilities. The agenda of this conference includes issues such as reducing working hours in various industries, and regulations on special worker recruitment systems and paid vacations. Regarding the issue of reducing working hours, in European countries with advanced industrial technology and overproduction, the implementation of this issue is indeed helpful in solving unemployment, and some countries have already implemented a 40-hour work week. China's situation is different, and due to the fierce economic aggression of the powers in recent years, general industries are in a precarious state. Workers cannot find work, let alone reduce working hours. Even from the perspective of strengthening national power, we should step up production, so reducing working hours is not something that can be discussed in China for the time being. The most painful issues for Chinese workers at present are unemployment and oppression by foreign capitalists in China. I have already drafted proposals on these two points, preparing to submit them to the conference. The former requests the international community to establish a mutual assistance system for job placement to adjust the supply and demand of labor, and the latter requests all member states of the International Labor Organization to abide by Chinese labor laws, recognize the rights of Chinese workers to form associations and hold meetings, in order to evoke international sympathy. In addition, there are also proposals for equal treatment of foreign workers and Chinese workers, and requesting countries to assist China in prohibiting opium and drugs. In short, I firmly believe that if we want to seek the liberation of workers, there must be genuine open and sincere cooperation among nations, abandoning all prejudices, so that we can reach satisfactory goals with each other. In addition to attending this conference, I also plan to take a convenient route to Italy, France, Russia, and other countries to investigate the situation of the labor movement, in order to contribute to our country in the future. This trip is expected to take several months. Before leaving, I received encouragement from all parties and a grand send-off. Today, I am grateful to have friends from all walks of life see me off from afar. I am deeply moved and ashamed. Thinking of the heavy responsibility of my duties and mission, I am even more concerned about my limited abilities. I hope to receive guidance at any time to correct my shortcomings. I will also report on the situation abroad at any time."</p>
<p>Representatives from All Circles See Off Zhu Xuefan and Zhao Banfu (Photo by Lin)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's Remarks</p>
<p>Zhao Banfu, the labor representative attending the 4th International Maritime Conference, stated, "In addition to serving as Secretary to Representative Zhu Xuefan, I am also honored to be appointed by the central government as a representative to attend the International Maritime Conference. The Maritime Conference was first held in 1920, the second in 1926, and the third in 1929. Because there were no results, a Maritime Preparatory Conference was held in 1935 to discuss the unresolved cases from the third conference in 1929, such as crew allocation and paid vacation issues. After the crew and sailors expressed their agreement, this year's 4th Maritime Conference will be specifically held to discuss it. The scope of discussion includes: 1. Crew working hours allocation, 2. Sailors' illness insurance, 3. Improving sailors' port happiness, 4. Paid vacation and other issues. As a representative, I will certainly work hard to achieve 1. Salary balance between Chinese and foreign sailors, 2. Abolish the contracting system, to meet the expectations of sailors. I am extremely grateful for the send-off from all circles. Banfu is limited in ability and hopes to receive guidance from all circles at any time."</p>
<p>Employer Representative</p>
<p>Regarding the Maritime Conference to be held in Geneva in September, the labor representative from our country has been determined to be Zhao Banfu, with Zhu Xuefan as the secretary. As for the employer representative seat, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry previously convened a meeting of relevant parties and decided to nominate it by the Shipping Association. It is heard that the association may not be able to realize this due to economic problems. Therefore, the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and the China General Federation of Industry intend to invite Mr. Wang Zhisheng to serve as the representative because Mr. Wang attended the 18th and 19th International Labor Conferences and has rich experience. According to Mr. Wang, he is currently considering whether he will go.</p>

<h3>Nanzhan Drug Trafficking Case; Mastermind Ye Zicai Executed by Firing Squad; Accomplices Wang Changgen and Others Sentenced to Eight Years</h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM on November 23 last year, the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, based on a report from the Xiedaxing Transportation Company, seized six sacks of red pill raw materials at the South Railway Station, totaling more than 100 kilograms, with a huge value. The drug traffickers Wang Changgen and Hu Shimo were arrested at the time. Later, according to Hu Shimo's confession, the police, together with the French Concession police, went to No. 21 Renshou Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, and arrested the mastermind of the case, Ye Zicai. They were sent to the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court for interrogation and legally ruled to be handed over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for return to the Songhu Garrison Command for interrogation. The case has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case was repeatedly investigated by the Military Law Office of the Garrison Command. The defendant, Ye Zicai, trafficked red pill and morphine to various counties in eastern Zhejiang for sale. He had been wanted by Yiwu County, Dongyang County, Zhejiang, and the magistrate of Yiwu County had reported to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which transferred the letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government for assistance in the arrest, but the case had not been solved. This time, he dared to traffic a large number of drugs, which was truly audacious and fearless of the law. According to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Crimes, he was sentenced to death and deprived of public rights for life. The defendants Wang Changgen and Hu Shimo assisted in transporting drugs, and they were ignorant and exploited by others, which was not without pity. They were each given a reduced sentence of eight years imprisonment and deprived of public rights for ten years. The Garrison Command then reported to the Chairman of the Military Commission and concurrent Opium Prohibition Supervisor for review, and the instruction was approved. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Commander Yang dispatched an adjutant, leading a platoon of military police, to the detention center to identify the prisoner Ye Zicai, and then took him to an open space next to the Zhongshan Road west of Longhua Temple for execution by firing squad. The Garrison Command's Fa Zi No. 137 announcement is recorded as follows: The case of the drug case of Ye Zicai presented by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation was received by the headquarters. The case was assigned to the Military Law Office for detailed review and sentenced Ye Zicai to death for transporting drugs and deprived of public rights for life, and the judgment was presented with the case file for approval by the Military Commission Fa Zi No. 2719. In addition to identifying the prisoner Ye Zicai and taking him to the execution ground for execution by firing squad to serve as a warning, this announcement is hereby made to the public. Announcement of the execution of drug offender Ye Zicai, 39 years old, from Taizhou, Zhejiang, April 24, 25th year of the Republic of China, Commander Yang Hu.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sailor Murder Case; Suspects Awaiting Trial; Secret Hearing Next Monday</h3>

According to reliable sources, Ye Haisheng and the other two arrested will be sent to the Special First Court together next Monday morning, to be handled by Judge Xiao Xiefei. The lawyer representing the police will be Lawyer Ru Baoyi, and he may file a public prosecution for murder under the criminal law on Monday. If the investigation procedures have not been completed by then, the prosecution may be postponed. It is heard that the hearing next Monday will still be held in secret and will not be open to the public.</p>
<h3>Chinese Police Officer Shot and Killed in Puto Road Police Station; Perpetrator is a Dismissed Chinese Police Officer</h3>
<p>He Changqing, from Shandong, was a patrol officer No. 1434 at the Putuo Road Police Station in the Public Concession. Yesterday at about 5:30 PM, He was assigned to stand guard near the intersection of Maba Road and Baiyu Lane in the Nanyinghua Lane, Robert Sheng Road. Unexpectedly, a man suddenly came forward and snatched the service pistol He Changqing was wearing, pulled the trigger, and fired three shots at He. He Changqing was caught off guard and was hit by two bullets, both in the abdomen, and immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, abandoned the gun and fled. Other nearby police officers arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm, and He was still able to speak, claiming that the assailant was a Chinese police officer No. 3421 who had already been dismissed. He then fainted and was rushed to the hospital by the police. It is understood that the two bullets penetrated the abdomen and injured the large intestine, and his condition is very critical. It is said that the reason for the attack was due to a personal vendetta. The police are currently conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Increase in Infectious Diseases in the Public Concession Last Month</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department's report for March, respiratory infectious diseases were generally increased this month compared to February, and measles were rampant. In terms of mortality, there was a slight increase among foreigners, reaching 0.062 per thousand, while among Chinese, it increased to 3 per thousand. The reason for this is that a large number of exposed corpses were discovered this month. This month, the 5th happened to be the Hundred Flowers Birthday on the lunar calendar. The number of Chinese infants vaccinated on this day reached 11,911, which is less than half of the nearly 26,000 on the same day last year. This is due to the cold weather. At the end of the month, the mosquito and fly extermination campaign had already begun. Since March 27, dormant mosquitoes and insects have begun to stir, so Shanghai residents traveling between urban and rural areas should pay attention in time. Although malaria will not be prevalent until after the autumn coolness, preventing it before it happens and eliminating the spread of mosquitoes and insects depends on the cooperation of the citizens at all times. In terms of mortality statistics this month, there were a total of 46 deaths among foreigners, with non-Chinese Asians accounting for 45 percent. Among the Chinese, the mortality rate was 3 per thousand. Regarding school health, there was a special increase in student illnesses in the Bureau's schools this month. The number of students taking sick leave reached 1,038, which is more than 242 than the previous month. Among them, infectious diseases accounted for 124, and measles accounted for 72.</p>
<h3>Hu Ji'an Sued by Father's Concubine Demanding a Lump Sum for Maintenance; Judge Advises Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Hu Ganqing, a shareholder of Fuchang Ginseng Firm in the South City and Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy on Beijing Road, passed away in 1929. Now, his son, Hu Ji'an, has been sued in the Civil Division of the First Special Court by his father's concubine, Madam Hu Li, through her lawyer. She is requesting a lump sum payment of 43,320 yuan for maintenance and 10,000 yuan for debt repayment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the Fourth Civil Court to hear the case. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff, Madam Hu Li, is 42 years old, from Huaian, and resides at 132 Guling Road. In 1914, she became the concubine of the defendant's father, Hu Ganqing. They lived together for over a decade and had a good relationship. The current claim is for the defendant to pay 60 yuan per month for maintenance. Since the plaintiff is 42 years old this year, calculating until the age of 60, there are still 19 years of maintenance due, totaling 25,080 yuan. Additionally, monthly expenses of 80 yuan for 19 years amount to 18,240 yuan, totaling 43,320 yuan. She is also requesting a lump sum payment of 10,000 yuan for debt repayment, and so on. The defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court and argue for the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit. The defendant stated that he usually provides the plaintiff with 60 yuan in national currency per month, plus room and board. However, at that time, the defendant was providing a total of 200 yuan for his father's other concubine (also surnamed Li) and his wife, Madam Wang. Later, the other Madam Li and Madam Huang declared that they relinquished this right, so it was enjoyed solely by the plaintiff. Now, the plaintiff is demanding a lump sum payment of over 50,000 yuan, which the defendant is unable to afford. After the death of the defendant's father, Ganqing, he only left behind a property valued at over 20,000 yuan and shares in the pharmacy, the amount of which is limited. Moreover, the defendant also has a legal mother and another concubine, to whom he also provides 60 yuan per month. Therefore, there is no issue with the defendant paying the plaintiff 60 yuan per month, but he cannot afford a lump sum payment or debt repayment. The defendant's father had promised each of his wives and concubines 3,000 yuan during his lifetime. Later, the money was used by the defendant's father, and the defendant was supposed to find a way to provide it later, depositing it in the business. Now, it has been found that the plaintiff's 3,000 yuan has been spent almost entirely and wasted. Regarding the telephone, the defendant's home has a telephone, but the plaintiff installed another telephone in her room, which is an unnecessary expense. Judge Fei reviewed the report and ordered that the case be rescheduled for further hearing on the afternoon of May 4. In the meantime, both lawyers are instructed to attempt reconciliation.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Representatives Crowd the Court to Observe Continued Hearing of Case Regarding Sale of Stolen Coal; Liu Hongsheng States That Disciplinary Action Against Zhang Yanzhang Was Approved by Entire Committee; Luo Dechuan Testifies that Youxin Did Indeed Sell Coal from Liujiang</h3>
<p>Youxin Coal Company claimed that Zhang Yanzhang violated the decision of the Shanghai Coal Industry Association to unanimously refuse to sell coal from the Liujiang Coal Mine, which had been seized by the Japanese and puppet regime through violence. Zhang secretly purchased a large amount of Liujiang coal from Tai Kee Company under the alias of Hebei coal and sold it at a reduced price. The Liujiang Company, based on intelligence, reported the matter to the Association, which resolved that Zhang had sold stolen coal, disregarding propriety. Consequently, his membership was revoked, and fellow businesses were notified to sever economic ties with him. After Zhang was sanctioned by the Association, he became enraged and filed a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Shen Jinzhou, the manager of Liujiang Company, for defamation. After the court held three hearings, Zhang requested that Liu Hongsheng, Mao Chunpu, Pan Yisan, Chen Yutang, Wei Hongwen, and five others also be added as defendants. The judge issued summons to verify the facts. As reported by this newspaper, Judge Ye Shengchao continued the hearing yesterday afternoon. Defendants Chen Yutang and Wei Hongwen were not summoned. The other four, Shen, Liu, Mao, and Pan, all appeared in court. Liu is the chairman of the Coal Industry Association, Mao and Pan are standing committee members of the Association, and Shen is an executive committee member. Chen Yutang currently resides at 15 Rehe Road and runs Shengyi Coal Company. It is said that he has not yet received a summons, so he did not vote during the hearing. Wei Hongwen has left Shanghai for business. His lawyer stated in court that Wei would return to Shanghai in two weeks. In addition, Luo Dechuan, who was sent by the Association to investigate Youxin's sale of stolen coal, was also summoned to court. Members of the Association who attended the hearing were as crowded as they were at the previous hearing, but they were able to maintain order and did not cause any disturbances as they had before. Judge Ye first questioned the defendant, Mao Chunpu. According to his testimony, after the Liujiang Coal Mine was seized by violence, the Liujiang Company requested assistance from the Association. The executive and supervisory committee meeting was convened, and it was decided to unanimously refuse to sell Liujiang coal. Subsequently, according to the Liujiang report, Zhang Yanzhang sold Liujiang coal under the alias of Hebei coal. After investigation, it was confirmed, and the decision was made to notify fellow businesses to sever economic ties with him and revoke his membership. This sanction had previously been applied to Dun Da, Yuan Yi, and other coal companies because they had also violated this decision. The nature of Liujiang white coal is different from that of white coal from other places. Anyone in this business can recognize it. Now that the mine has been seized, purchasing the mine's coal from those who seized it should naturally be considered receiving stolen coal. Liu Hongsheng testified that all the measures to punish Zhang Yanzhang were passed by the entire executive and supervisory committee and then publicly announced to the market. Luo Dechuan testified that he and a Mr. Yang were sent by the Association to investigate the coal imported by Zhang Yanzhang, and it was indeed Liujiang coal. The court stated that since Chen and Wei, the two defendants, had not arrived, the hearing was rescheduled for next Friday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of Man and Woman's Tragic Death on Qingdao Road; Man Had No Legitimate Occupation and Killed Woman After Failing to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Hua Axiang, a 34-year-old woman from Suzhou who resided in a small room at 51 Qingdao Road and worked as a "sister" (madam) at the Caifang brothel in Fuyu Lane on Yunnan Road, was suddenly stabbed to death by a Mr. Huang. The man then committed suicide. After receiving the report, the Xinzha police station dispatched Detective Hua Yiwen, Detective Ma Jinbiao, and others to investigate. The bodies of the man and woman were taken to the forensic center on Fielun Road for examination. It is now known that the woman had been cohabitating with the man for many years. However, because the man had no legitimate occupation, his finances were extremely tight. As a result, the woman ended their cohabitation and later became involved with another man. Although the man and woman had separated, the man often asked the woman for money, causing constant trouble. Initially, she provided assistance, but later she cut him off. Therefore, the man tried to extort money from the woman the previous year, leading him to trick her into a room in a certain hotel where he choked her, intending to kill her. However, the tea server discovered the situation, and the plan was foiled. The tragic event resulted from her refusal to give money. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and a court clerk, arrived at the forensic center to examine the bodies. Based on the report from the detectives regarding the investigation, Song ruled that both the unnamed man and Hua Axiang died from stab wounds. Hua Axiang's body was claimed by Hua Arong for coffin and burial, and the unnamed man's body was taken to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Veteran Performer Guan Hongbin Sues Female Disciple for Breach of Contract; Failure to Pay Due Compensation After Debuting on Stage; Demands 480 Yuan in Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Zheng Mengxia, a Cantonese woman who won the Shanghai Dancing Competition sponsored by RCA Victor Company in 1934, is now performing Peking opera at the Da Chan Theater. Her teacher, Guan Hongbin, is suing her in the First Special District Court for breach of contract. The facts are as follows: In addition to her dancing skills, Zheng is also proficient in Peking opera. On October 11, 1934, with the introduction of Li Hongkui, she became a disciple of veteran performer Guan Hongbin to learn Peking opera. At that time, a contract was signed stating that if Zheng formally debuted on stage, she would pay Guan 20% of her earnings for five years. However, since Zheng joined the Tian Chan Theater, her monthly salary has been 800 yuan, but she has failed to fulfill the contract. Guan hired lawyer Yao Junyu to file a lawsuit, requesting that Zheng pay the plaintiff 20% of her earnings from the first month of the lunar calendar to the end of March, totaling 480 yuan in national currency. The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Meng Tingke in the Twelfth Court. The defendant, Zheng Mengxia, did not appear in court, but a lawyer was appointed. The plaintiff's lawyer presented the facts, submitting the contract personally written by Zheng, a letter of proof from the introducer, Li Hongkui. Zheng's lawyer argued that although Zheng had taken the plaintiff as her teacher, the plaintiff had not taught Zheng any drama, so he was not entitled to the rights stipulated in the contract. Furthermore, he pointed out that the phrase "join a troupe" in the contract meant that the plaintiff and Zheng would be performing in the same troupe. Since he was not performing in the same troupe as Zheng, he had no reason to receive 20% of the profits. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant's defense was incorrect. Judge Meng reviewed the documents and stated that it was necessary for both parties to appear in court in person. He ordered that the hearing be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Tragic Death of Farmer in Yanjiage, Gaoqiao; Hearing Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled; Farmer's Wife and Son Passed Away in Custody</h3>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Chongming in Yanjiage, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was murdered on November 21 of last year and his body was dumped on a river beach. The local court dispatched an official to examine the body and detained the deceased's wife, Chen Huang, and his maternal uncle, Lu Zhiliang, as suspects. Prosecutor Li interrogated them and filed charges of joint murder with the criminal court. Chief Judge Cai Dingcheng of the criminal court held two trials without a conclusion. The details have been reported in previous issues. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Chief Judge Cai continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Court and ordered that Chen Huang and Lu Zhiliang, who were in custody, be brought to court for questioning. Both claimed that they had been wrongly accused. Witnesses Wang Ronggen, Shi Cailang, Wang Qilang, and others testified that they were neighbors and fellow villagers of Chen Hongfu, that the couple had a good relationship, and that Chen Hongfu was well-behaved. They did not know who had murdered him. At this point, Prosecutor Li Fen arrived in court, presented the case, and began the debate. The lawyers hired by the defendants, Lu Jia and Zhu Wenming, defended the defendants for a long time. The judge then asked Chen Huang and others if they had any final statements. Chen Huang replied that she had been wrongfully imprisoned for many days and requested permission to be released on bail because she was nearing the end of her pregnancy. She also stated that her three-year-old son, Xuexiang, had gradually weakened since being brought into custody because there was no food for children. She had already stated this to the court, and now the child had died in custody the day before yesterday (the 22nd). Chen Huang burst into tears after finishing her statement, appearing extremely distraught, and the audience was moved. Judge Cai stated that the case was clear, considered it concluded, and scheduled the sentencing. Both defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed Incident at the Continental Ballroom Still Under Investigation; Continued Hearing Yesterday on the Circumstances; Another Hearing Scheduled in One Week</h3>
<p>Chen Weiling, an employee of Dazhonghang at 505 Henan Road, went to the Continental Ballroom at 33 Ningbo Road on the evening of the 9th of this month with his colleague Song Zhibiao and friend Yang Jingmu to dance. Since Chen and Song were not good at dancing, they simply sat and drank tea while only Yang Jingmu danced. They left around 2:00 AM. However, Liang Shaoqian (also known as He Liang), an employee of the ballroom, mistakenly believed that Chen and others were there to freeload by just drinking tea and arbitrarily accused Yang Jingmu of not buying a dance ticket. Liang rashly led over a dozen of the ballroom's staff to follow and confront Chen and his companions. Fortunately, two Western police officers passed by at that time, and Liang and the others did not dare to commit violence, allowing Chen and the others to escape. However, on the evening of the 12th, Chen and the others returned to the Continental Ballroom. As soon as they sat down, Liang and the manager of the ballroom, Zhou Yaorong, suddenly came to provoke them. Without asking why, they insisted that Chen and the others had come to seek revenge. They forcibly ordered Chen to leave the ballroom. Unexpectedly, Liang and the others had already arranged for over forty gangsters to lie in wait in the cloakroom. As soon as Chen and the others walked out, they rushed forward aggressively. More than ten of the gangsters were carrying knives, and Liang Shaoqian also pulled out a knife and slashed Chen Weiling's left wrist, causing him to bleed profusely. Song Zhibiao was also surrounded and beaten, causing injuries to his face. The situation became chaotic, and the crowd became agitated. A dancer named Zhu Minggui (also known as A Ming) was mistaken by the thugs as Chen's companion and was slashed in the back, causing him to collapse on the ground. However, the ballroom did not report the incident to the police and, fearing that the dancers would spread the word, ordered the security guard to close the iron gate of the ballroom, trapping Chen and the others inside and allowing them to be beaten. After the thugs saw that Chen and others were injured, they dispersed. Fortunately, another dancer acted courageously and used his own car, number 5995, to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because the matter involved bloodshed, the hospital notified the Central Police Station by phone, which dispatched Detectives Wang Bocheng, Ren Fengwu, Wang Yingjie, and He Renrui to investigate. The injured parties and Song Zhibiao and Tian Zhongyu firmly identified Liang Shaoqian as the ringleader and stated that Chen and Zhu's injuries were caused by Liang's knife. The police station applied to the First Special District Court for an arrest warrant and arrested Liang on charges of causing serious injury under Article 278, Section 1 of the Criminal Code. At that time, Chen Weiling's injuries were severe, and his life was uncertain. The manager of the ballroom, Zhou Yaorong, also needed to be investigated. Therefore, a request was made for a postponement, which was granted by Judge Qian Hongye, who ordered Liang Shaoqian to be remanded in custody and the hearing to be rescheduled. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the hearing was continued by Judge Qian in the First Criminal Court. Chen Weiling hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to file a civil suit. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that although the victim, Chen Weiling, had arrived in court, his injuries were so severe that he might be permanently disabled, and doctors could not yet make a definitive diagnosis. He would need to wait a few days for further examination before a decision could be made. Chen Weiling then submitted a report describing the circumstances of the stabbing. He stated that the knife wound was caused by Liang. When questioned in court whether he knew the dancer Chen Miaoxiang, he replied that he had been to the ballroom a total of three times and could not dance, so he did not know Chen. He also did not know Zhu Lugui and Tian Zhongyu. Only Yang Jingmu went with him. When asked what caused the dispute, he replied that he did not know. Yang Jingmu was summoned to court and, after his age and origin were asked, was questioned whether he was familiar with the dancer Chen Miaoxiang. He replied that he did not know Chen. He said that when he went to the ballroom, he liked to dance with anyone and did not specify a particular person. When asked whether the dispute was caused by jealousy, he replied that it was not. The judge then told him that the ballroom was always welcoming to dancers and there was no reason to injure a dancer without reason. Therefore, there must be a reason, and he should state the facts. Yang replied that he really did not know the reason. Judge Qian then questioned Liang Shaoqian, who claimed that the victims were arguing with another group of patrons in the ballroom. He ordered them to go outside the ballroom, and a fight broke out as soon as they were outside. He was terrified and did not dare to look directly at them. Later, after the victims were injured, he helped bandage them and did not stab them. When asked whether the Continental Ballroom employed two dancers named Chen Miaoxiang and Yan Yezhen, he replied that it did. When asked who danced with Chen Miaoxiang that day, he replied Song Zhibiao. When asked if he knew the reason for the dispute, he replied that he only knew that the victims were arguing with another group of dancers, but he did not know what it was about. He also claimed that he did not commit the assault and said that he could bring the toilet attendants employed by the Continental Ballroom, who were managed by Liang, to testify. He hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him and requested that the toilet attendants be summoned to court to testify. Judge Qian stated that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled the hearing for one week later.</p>
<h3>Elderly Woman Jiang Fang Deceitfully Employs Women for Prostitution; Using the Pretense of Hiring Helpers to Deceive and Force Prostitution; Three Women Dealt with Separately by the Court</h3>
<p>Jiang Fang, an elderly woman from Ningbo, 48 years old, residing at 35 Qiaojia Lane West, Dadongmen, recently had a bizarre idea. Last month, she went to Zhou Jinji's employment agency on Zhaojia Road under the false pretense of hiring female helpers. She selected three beautiful young women: Xu Amei, 18 years old, from Songjiang; Wu Erbao, 16 years old, from Songjiang; and Lu Xiaomei, 18 years old, from Ningbo. She took them to the Yongxing Guiji Inn at 314 Miniti Yin Road, South of the Slaughterhouse Company in the French Concession and rented room number 12 to use as a place for prostitution. She forced them to receive guests and would beat them if they were not compliant. She also restricted their freedom of movement. The incident occurred the night before last when Yang Weisan, a soldier recently arrived in Shanghai from the capital, 25 years old, from Wuxi, was staying at room 16 of the Yongxing Inn. Jiang Fang led Wu Erbao to Yang's room to solicit a stay. When Yang saw that Erbao was short and young, he refused. Fang repeatedly pleaded, and they finally settled on one yuan. After Fang left, Yang questioned Wu Erbao about her background. Erbao told him the whole story of how Fang had deceived her by claiming to hire her as a helper and then forced her into prostitution. Yang was moved and borrowed five yuan from a friend, giving it to Wu Erbao to buy a train ticket back home. However, Jiang Fang stepped in to stop her, accusing Yang of enticing someone else's woman. Yang became enraged and reported the matter to the French police. Detective Gao Chaozhen was dispatched to take Fang and the three women into custody. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian. The police station's lawyer stated that the investigation of the case was not yet complete and requested a postponement. Xu Amei stated that she had come to Shanghai from a poor family to work as a helper, but she was deceived by Fang and forced into prostitution. The money she earned from prostitution was all taken by Fang. Wu Erbao stated that she had come to Shanghai on the 24th of last month and was deceived by Fang into working as a helper, but then forced to receive guests. She had received more than ten clients in total, and the money she earned and the first-time payment were all taken by Fang. She had not received a single penny. Now she had contracted syphilis, but fortunately a guest surnamed Yang had reported the matter to the police and had her arrested. Otherwise, they would have continued to suffer. Lu Xiaomei's testimony was similar. The judge asked them why they had not reported the matter to the police earlier. The three women replied that they had just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside and that they were being held captive by Fang and could not move freely. Witness Yang Changsan testified about what had happened, stating that he had seen that Erbao was young and although he had paid one yuan for the night, he had not engaged in sexual relations. Detective Gao Chaozhen also stated the details. He said that the families of Xu Amei and Wu Erbao had not yet been notified in their hometowns. However, Lu Xiaomei had a relative who had come to claim her. When questioned, Jiang Fang stated that she had called the three women from the employment agency to take care of the children. Later, they voluntarily became prostitutes, and she did not force them. She used the money she earned to buy them clothes and other things. Her remaining testimony was evasive. Judge Sun ordered Fang to be remanded in custody. Xu Amei and Wu Erbao were temporarily sent to a charitable organization for care, and Lu Xiaomei was taken away by her relatives. The hearing was rescheduled for the morning of May 2 for further review.</p>
<h3>Police Station on North Sichuan Road Uncovers Gambling Den</h3>
<p>The North Sichuan Road Police Station learned that a gambling den, organized by Japanese ruffians colluding with Chinese drug dealers, was operating on the upper floor of the Qichang cigarette and paper shop at 20 Lane 87, Wusong Road. At around 9:20 PM last night, police officers Ouyang Wei dispatched Officer Liu Zhenya, Sergeant Sang Weihan, and police officers Yang Dongping, Liu Yongsheng, and Han Deqing to the location. Inside the house were people dressed in Japanese clothing and Chinese people lying on the floor smoking drugs. However, since the household was Japanese or Korean, it was not convenient for the patrolmen to enter and search. They sent a police officer back to the station to report to Officer Ouyang Wei, who instructed translator Pan to go to the Japanese consulate and request that a police officer be sent to assist in the search. However, the consul, Nichizhang Youquan, refused to cooperate, stating that a formal written notice was required before searching a drug operation. Translator Pan was unable to get anywhere. After notifying Officer Liu, the officers waited at the location and arrested Guan Abao, Lin Ruichang, Cao Alian, Han Shuishan, Lu Chengzhou, Tan Chunming, Liu Chengxian, Yang Shunqing, Zhang Jinbiao, Zhang Sen, and ten others. After questioning them at the station, they were sent to the bureau for interrogation on drug-related charges.</p>
<h3>Government Order to Stop Disturbances by Former Commercial Press Employees</h3>
<p>The former employees of the Commercial Press who were laid off after the January 28th Incident recently gathered a large group of people and went to the press's distribution office on Henan Road, demanding that they all be rehired. The press replied that since resuming business, they had been hiring former employees as much as possible and could not hire them unnecessarily. The former employees were dissatisfied and repeatedly went to demand it, but the issue was not resolved. The press reported the situation to the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that it be stopped. The municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and stop it and informed the press of the order. The written order is as follows: "We have received your report. After the January 28th Incident, the press legally laid off the original employees. The case has been closed for a long time. Why are the laid-off employees being incited to make unreasonable disturbances now? This is deliberately obstructing legitimate business and endangering public order. It is extremely inappropriate. In addition to strictly ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and stop those who are inciting the unrest, you are hereby informed."</p>
<h3>Former Lovers Now Enemies; Principal Pushes Female Teacher Downstairs; Chen Zhiying Suffers Serious Injuries to Both Legs; Wu Yao Denies Pushing and Claims She Jumped</h3>
<p>Wu Yao, 31 years old, from Suzhou, the principal of Jinghua Elementary and Middle School at 865 Tangshan Road, previously had a romantic relationship with Chen Zhiying, a 23-year-old female teacher from Songjiang, and they were engaged to be married. Recently, they had a falling out and filed for divorce in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, with a settlement of 5,000 yuan in alimony. Later, after mediation, they reached a settlement of 620 yuan. Wu did not pay the money, and Chen detained a harmonium worth 100 yuan from the school. At 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, Wu sent someone to Zhiying to retrieve the harmonium because another harmonium had been damaged. Chen became angry and went to Wu Yao's office on the third floor, where they began to quarrel. Wu pushed her out of the window, causing her to fall and injure herself severely. Someone telephoned the Huishan Police Station, which sent an ambulance to take the injured woman to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Bazilu for treatment. She suffered serious injuries to both legs. Detective Wu Anxian arrested Wu Yao and detained him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and requested a postponement to wait for the victim to recover. The school teacher Qian Guocheng stated that he heard a noise upstairs and went to investigate, and Chen Zhiying suddenly jumped out of the window. He did not see Principal Wu push her. When questioned, Wu Yao stated that Chen came to his office to make trouble and quarrel. She jumped out of the window to commit suicide, and he did not push her. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be remanded in custody and the hearing was rescheduled for seven days.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Registration Dispute Unresolved: Guild Holds General Meeting, Two Resolutions Submitted to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Regarding the rickshaw registration and mutual aid fee issues, the Shanghai Special District Rickshaw Guild convened a general membership meeting the night before last at 10:00 PM, attended by over a hundred people, chaired by Hou Shao'an. After discussion, it was resolved that due to the large number of unemployed rickshaw pullers, rickshaw registration should be handled without restrictions, in accordance with the Public Works Department's regulations. Regarding mutual aid fees, since rickshaw renters were unwilling to pay, rickshaw owners would no longer collect the fees on their behalf starting from May 1st. This was unanimously approved and will be brought up for discussion during negotiations with the Municipal Council next week. Furthermore, the Jiacheng Rickshaw Company, located on Youheng Road in Hongkou East and established by Westerners, was persuaded by the Municipal Council to register its rickshaw pullers. The owner, Mr. Mai Xianshi, obtained registration certificates and handed them over to the foreman. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, over five hundred unemployed rickshaw pullers went to request registration, but due to the large number of unemployed, there were not enough certificates to distribute, leading to disturbances. The Jiading Road Police Station dispatched detectives to dissuade and suppress the disturbance, and the rickshaw pullers dispersed around 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>The directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Fish Market held a joint meeting yesterday to review the market's business regulations, inviting representatives from ice-fresh and river-fresh fish merchants to participate in the discussion. The articles were finalized and will be submitted to the ministry for approval and promulgation. It is rumored that the opening date, originally set for May 1st, may be postponed due to incomplete arrangements. The details are explored below:</p>
<p>Fish Merchants Request Amendment of Regulations</p>
<p>The fish market's business regulations have been promulgated by the ministry, but when fish merchants joined, they requested amendments to the regulations regarding commissions and brokers. Therefore, at the company's founding meeting, several directors were appointed to be responsible for reviewing the regulations. The opinions of the fish industry were adopted, and after several meetings, it was decided to instruct Director Yu Kaizhan and Deputy Manager Sun Guchen to go to Beijing to consult with Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and held a general meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting Held Yesterday for Discussion</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was held at 5:00 PM on the second floor of the Zhonghui Bank, attended by Chairman Du Yuesheng, Directors Wu Xingya, Yu Kaizhan, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Fayao, Zhang Shenzhi, Yan Fang, Fang Jiaobo, Yang Zhixiong, Zhu Jinqing, Tang Chengzong, Qu Heming, and Liu Weijun, Supervisors Qian Xinzhi, Jin Tingsun, and Zhan Kejuan, General Manager Wang Xiaolai, Deputy Managers Sun Guchen and Zhu Kaiguan, and over forty fish merchant representatives. The meeting lasted approximately three hours, finalizing the business regulations, which will be submitted to the Ministry for approval and promulgation.</p>
<p>Opening Date Likely to Be Postponed</p>
<p>According to reporter inquiries, although there was considerable controversy regarding commissions, in consideration of the difficulties faced by fish merchants, the commission rate was set at 7%, only a 1% reduction from the previous rate (previously 8%). Moreover, miscellaneous commissions, such as wharf loading and unloading fees of 4%, have now been reduced or waived. The number of brokers has been increased to forty. It is estimated that there are thirty fish merchants who have joined the association, and others may voluntarily serve as brokers in accordance with the broker regulations. Furthermore, although the market has been taken over by the general manager, the arrangements for the market have not yet begun due to the review of regulations. If the market cannot open as scheduled on May 1st, the opening will be postponed for several days.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Goods Promotion Association Fortune Fruit Ticket Distribution Method</h3>
<p>The Fortune Fruit Tickets issued by the Shanghai Goods Promotion Association will be drawn on May 1st at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce auditorium. As the date approaches, the evaluation personnel hired by the association, such as Zhu Jingchuan, are actively evaluating and distributing the donated goods for prizes. All preparations were completed yesterday. The prizes will be displayed at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Exhibition Hall from the 26th to the 28th, and all sectors of society are welcome to visit. The method for distributing prizes for the Fortune Fruit Tickets is as follows: The association has issued 12,000 Fortune Fruit Tickets, each with a prize. The prizes are divided into special and regular categories. The special and regular prizes will be determined by lottery. The value of the special prizes ranges from over 10,000 yuan to over 10 yuan, divided into twelve classes: first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth class. The value of the regular prizes ranges from over nine yuan to over two yuan, divided into five classes. The number of winning tickets is as follows: first class 1,200 tickets, second class 1,200 tickets, third class 2,400 tickets, fourth class 3,600 tickets, and fifth class 3,600 tickets, totaling 12,000 tickets. Those who win a special prize will not be given a regular prize. The special and regular prizes will be divided into classes according to their value during the prize distribution. However, after the special prizes are divided into classes, their prizes of the same value should still be numbered in order. A prize order list will be printed and publicized to the public three days before the lottery. After the regular prizes are divided into classes, a list of prizes should also be prepared and handed over to the distribution department for safekeeping three days before the lottery. The special prizes will be drawn by lottery, using 12,000 numbered balls placed in a large ball, and 12 prize balls placed in a small ball. First, the small ball will be shaken. If the prize ball that comes out is one, it is first class. Only the large ball needs to be shaken once, and one numbered ball will be drawn. If the prize ball that comes out is two, it is second class. The large ball must be shaken twice, and two numbered balls will be drawn. The first ball that is drawn will win the first prize in the second class, and the second ball that is drawn will win the second prize in the second class, and so on. The regular prizes will be drawn by referring to the lottery method of drawing the last digit. (Since there are 12,000 tickets, each last digit has 1,200 tickets). Ten numbered balls from 0 to 9 will be placed in a large ball, and five prize balls from 1 to 5 will be placed in a small ball. First, the small ball will be shaken. If the prize ball that comes out is one, it is first class. Only the large ball needs to be shaken once, and one numbered ball will be drawn. All tickets whose last digit is the same as the digit on the numbered ball that is drawn will win a first-class prize, which will be 1,200 tickets. If the prize ball that comes out is two, it is second class. Only the large ball needs to be shaken once, and one numbered ball will be drawn. All tickets whose last digit is the same as the digit on the numbered ball that is drawn will win a second-class prize, which will also be 1,200 tickets. If the prize ball that comes out is three, it is third class. The large ball must be shaken twice, and two numbered balls will be drawn. All tickets whose last digit is the same as the digits on the two numbered balls that are drawn will win a third-class prize, which will be 2,400 tickets. If the prize ball that comes out is four or five, it is fourth class or fifth class. The large ball must be shaken three times, and three numbered balls will be drawn. The calculation is as per the previous example, and the number of tickets will be 3,600 each. However, since there are many regular prizes, the drawing can only divide them into classes and cannot determine the order within the same class. Therefore, in addition to the lottery method, a drawing method must also be used to determine the order. The order of the special prizes of the same class will be determined by the order in which the numbered balls are drawn. All winners can check the special prize number list and the number order list with their tickets to know which prize they should receive. Those who do not win a special prize must come to collect the regular prize. According to the class that was drawn during the lottery, they must draw a lot from the box set up at the issuing place for that class. The number of the lot corresponds to the number of the regular prize. Whichever number is drawn, that prize will be issued according to the record, to ensure fairness.</p>

<h3>Early Diagnosis Work at Lung Hospital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lung Sanatorium, located at 4 West Avenue, is a specialized hospital for the treatment of lung diseases in Shanghai. Established for over eight years, it has cured a large number of patients with tuberculosis. However, according to the results of examinations over the years, most patients do not pay attention to the disease in its early stages, taking various medications indiscriminately. Only after the disease has worsened and the symptoms have become critical do they begin to pay attention. Not only does this waste a lot of money, but it also loses the proper treatment period. Therefore, the hospital is publishing its opinions on early diagnosis and treatment. If a cough lasts for more than three weeks, or if there is occasional blood or blood spots in the sputum, or if the body is tired and accompanied by fever, or if the appetite is poor and the weight gradually decreases, or if the complexion is pale and the spirit is weak, an X-ray examination of the lungs should be performed as soon as possible. If a disease is detected, it should be treated in isolation. In this way, families can be protected from infection, and patients can concentrate on treatment in the hospital, making it easier to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The hospital is located in a quiet area in western Shanghai, with fresh air and convenient transportation. Medical services are provided by Chinese and German pulmonary experts. In addition to using air, food, and nutritional methods, various lung compression surgeries are also performed to treat both the symptoms and the root cause, with rapid results. All fees have also been reduced compared to before, with hospitalization starting from one yuan per day and monthly rates starting from sixty yuan.</p>

On December 15, 1935, the ministry issued him a Class B Chief Engineer Certificate No. 829. However, Jin, the director of the Jiyi Document Agency in the Nanshi area, secretly withheld the certificate while serving as a secretary in the Marine Engineers' Association and demanded 250 yuan from Miao Caiquan to hand over the certificate. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Miao reported this to the Marine Engineers' Association and requested the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to the Jiyi Document Agency, where Jin was arrested on the spot. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation on charges of privately taking public documents and demanding rewards. The privately withheld certificate was also found and seized at the Jiyi Document Agency and has been taken to the bureau.</p>
<h3>Major Fish Merchant Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>The Tongrenchang Fish Merchant on Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession reported that 16,800 yuan in cash was stolen on the morning of the 10th of last month. The police were asked to investigate the case. It is now known that the police have learned that the robbers are hiding in the Chinese area. They dispatched detectives the night before last to arrest several suspects on Xinmin Road in Zhabei. The main culprit is still at large and is currently being searched for.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Ticket Money Stolen</h3>
<p>Wang Hexiang, from Jiangbei, works as a ticket seller for the Public Bus Company in the Public Concession. Yesterday, Wang was assigned to work on the Route 5 public bus running between the North Railway Station and the Sanmaoge Bridge. When he finished his shift, he totaled the earnings and had 11,500 copper coins. He stopped at the North Henan Road Bazilu intersection bus stop to count the tickets and copy down the ticket numbers. In the blink of an eye, the 11,500 copper coins that he had placed under his seat suddenly disappeared. He immediately searched for them, but they were nowhere to be found. He was very anxious because he had little income and could hardly afford to be responsible for the loss, and he was also afraid of endangering his job. Therefore, he reluctantly went to the local police station to report the theft and asked them to investigate. It is unknown whether they will be able to recover the money. It is outrageous that thieves would target such a person, it is too much of a joke.</p>
<h3>Accountant Dalli Passes Away from Illness</h3>
<p>Mr. Dalli, a famous French accountant in Shanghai, passed away at the Guangci Hospital at 8:00 PM on the 23rd of this month due to a stroke.

In 1912, he came to Shanghai and served as Chief Accountant and Secretary of the French Tramway Company. In 1921, he taught at Aurora University and the Sino-French National Institute of Technology. He also established an accounting firm at 1 Huangpu Beach, with departments for real estate and insurance, and his business was very prosperous. He had a wide circle of friends, and both Chinese and foreign acquaintances expressed their regret upon hearing the news.</p>
<h3>Song Xueqin's Car Hits Clothes Maker Case Concluded</h3>
<p>The car of Song Xueqin, the Shanghai office director of Sun Chuanfang, the former commander-in-chief of the Five-Province Allied Forces, with license plate number 4412, was traveling east on Avenue Edward VII on the 26th of last month. When the car reached the intersection of Dongxin Bridge, the driver suddenly drove the car close to the curb and hit Lu Baoluo, a tailor from Suzhou who was walking on the road, injuring his left forehead. He was treated for a long time and showed slight improvement. Lu's mother, Ms. Wang, said that her son used to be a tailor and that several members of the family relied on his income. Since being injured, he has suffered from mental abnormalities and will no longer be able to work. It is difficult for the family to make a living. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to sue Song for negligent injury in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that he be punished according to law and compensate her son for 30 yuan per month for a period of 20 years, totaling 7,200 yuan in national currency. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye summoned Lu Baoluo, supported by his mother, Ms. Wang, to the court. She said that Baoluo was still confused due to the shock at the time and that his speech was incoherent, so she described the circumstances of Song's car accident on his behalf. The defendant, Song Xueqin, did not appear, but his lawyer appeared in court, claiming that Song was not in Shanghai and that the plaintiff's injuries were not caused by Song. After mutual arguments between the two lawyers, the court adjourned and will announce the verdict on the afternoon of the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Forgery and Fraud Case: Xu Yi's Appeal Fails, Still Sentenced to Eight Months</h3>
<p>Li Quanyuan, manager of the Gen Tai He He Flour Mill, previously sued lawyer Xu Yi and his younger brother Xu Yiming, along with his father-in-law Zhao Pei, in the First Special District Court on charges of forgery and fraud.

Xu Yi and Xu Yiming were jointly ordered to return ten checks from the China Gen Tai He He Flour Mill to the plaintiff, amounting to 100,870 yuan. After the judgment, both parties were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The hearing has concluded, and yesterday afternoon, the Second Branch of the High Court announced its judgment, stating that the original judgment concerning Xu Yi and Xu Yiming's sentences and the dismissal of Zhao Pei's case were all revoked. Xu Yi, knowing the matters were untrue, repeatedly caused public officials to record them in official documents under their jurisdiction, and was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. Xu Yiming repeatedly assisted others in knowingly causing public officials to record untrue matters in official documents under their jurisdiction, and was fined 300 yuan. If unable to pay, he could commute to labor service at a rate of three yuan per day. Zhao Pei, also known as Zhao Guisheng, jointly used fraudulent means to induce others to hand over property and was fined 800 yuan. If unable to pay, he could commute to labor service at a rate of three yuan per day. Li Quanyuan and Xu Yi's other appeals were rejected, and the accompanying civil appeal was also rejected.</p>

<h3>Letter: Letter from the China International Famine Relief Commission</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: The major newspaper on the 13th of this month reported that the China International Famine Relief Commission withheld 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of national currency in relief funds from Anhui Province in 1932 and decided to use them to subsidize the Guiding Huai River Project. To date, the funds have not been allocated, and the Guiding Huai River Association has repeatedly negotiated, because the funds were previously used to mortgage real estate in Shanghai and cannot be readily converted into cash. Please note that our organization is named the China International Famine Relief Commission, abbreviated as the International Famine Relief Commission, and is a formally registered organization with the government. The headquarters is located in Beiping, and an office was established in Shanghai after the Yangtze River flood in 1931 (address: 505 Henan Road). The aforementioned dispute over relief funds clearly concerns another organization. However, due to the similar names, we are deeply concerned that the outside world may misunderstand the truth, leading to confusion. Therefore, we are sending this letter to request that you publish it in the "Letters" section to inform the public. With sincere regards, Shanghai Office of the China International Famine Relief Commission, April 11, 1936.</p>

<h3>Regimen for Venereal Diseases and Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The source of this disease lies in the decline of the seminal glands. Therefore, in addition to electrotherapy, the most effective treatment is to take seminal gland preparations. As for daily regimen, in summary, it includes the following points:</p>
<p>(Diet) Must consume nutritious foods.</p>
<p>(Exercise) Strengthen the body and mind.</p>
<p>(Mindfulness) Do not worry, calm the mind and forget anxieties, purify the heart and reduce desires, and always maintain noble aspirations and an optimistic attitude.</p>
<p>(Avoid) Tobacco, alcohol, and stimulating foods. During the treatment period, strictly abstain from sexual activity.</p>
<p>(Hygiene) Get plenty of sunlight, breathe fresh air, avoid overwork, and wake up early and go to bed early.</p>
<h3>Safe Smoking Cessation Talk</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>To safely quit smoking, one must first seek to be painless. To avoid pain, first seek to cure the pain and illness.</p>
<p>During the smoking cessation period, due to the sudden physiological changes, one often suffers from mental fatigue. Nocturnal emissions, insomnia, and pre-existing illnesses also take the opportunity to flare up, which are the only obstacles on the road to quitting smoking. These often cause the entire smoking cessation effort to be abandoned halfway.</p>
<p>For safe smoking cessation, "Shengzhisu" is the best. This is because "Shengzhisu" has the great effect of revitalizing and eliminating diseases, and can thoroughly eliminate nicotine and quickly break the addiction. If you suffer from nocturnal emissions, you should also take "Ximitu's Spermatostatic Pills" to treat it. If you have stomach pain, then "Weitongling" is the most effective. If you suffer from a weak stomach, then "Jianweisu" should be used. If you suffer from bone pain, then "Jiangsideng's Bone Pain Pills" will eradicate it. Once the pain is eliminated, smoking cessation will safely be completed.</p>

<h3>Saved Youth from Nocturnal Emissions</h3>
<p>— Letter from Xiang Fengzhang</p>
<p>I used to masturbate, which led to nocturnal emissions. My essence was deficient and my brain was weak, causing me to suffer from insomnia, forgetfulness, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, back pain, and night sweats. I tried many treatments without success. (Omitted) Thanks to Dr. Zhan Nianzeng's electrotherapy, which was painless. He instructed me to purchase "Ximitu's Spermatostatic Pills" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy to treat my nocturnal emissions and to take "Shengzhisu" to nourish my brain and essence and to treat my illness and weakness.

<h3>Example of Root Canal Treatment for Joint Pain</h3>

<h3>Leukorrhea - Irregular Menstruation</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>The seminal glands are the most important glands in the human body. If the seminal glands are weak, diseases will arise. In women, this includes palace inflammation, leukorrhea, and irregular menstruation.</p>
<p>For example, last summer, Mrs. Lou Yangshan came to me for a consultation, complaining of irregular menstruation and vaginal discharge. As a result, her body was thin and her breasts were shriveled. She had been married for many years and had not been able to conceive. I observed that her seminal glands were weak and that no other medicine could be effective. I instructed her to purchase "Female Shengzhisu" from the Taihe Pharmacy. For the sake of a speedy effect, I also instructed her to use "Liaodailing" externally. With both internal and external treatments, within a month, the leukorrhea stopped and the menstruation became regular. Her body developed and her breasts became full, fully expressing the health and beauty that a young woman should have. Last month, Mr. Lou introduced his close relative to me to treat a stomach ailment. He said that he had learned that his wife was several months pregnant.</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment of Premature Ejaculation and Stomach Pain with Famous Medicines</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. Ye Chengbang) Due to my ignorance of health maintenance, I first suffered from stomach pain and then from premature ejaculation. Repeated medication failed, and my condition worsened. Later, I read in this journal that premature ejaculation could be treated by taking the famous medicine "Shengzhisu," and that stomach pain could be treated by taking "Weitongling" and "Jianweisu" together. I went to the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company and purchased them according to the instructions. (Omitted) Now my sexual function has recovered and my stomach is healthy and my body is strong. Compared with before, I am like a different person.</p>

<h3>Records of Venereal Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianzeng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company Building, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Circumcision Treats Kidney Failure</p>
<p>Restoring Function. Regaining Development. A Son is Born.</p>
<p>Patient Yang Senzhai. Twenty-nine years old. From Nanxiang. In business. - Mr. Yang came to me last spring, complaining of kidney failure, premature ejaculation, physical weakness, incomplete development, and infertility. After my diagnosis, I found that Mr. Yang's foreskin was too long, preventing his sexual organs from developing. Furthermore, his seminal glands were damaged by masturbation, resulting in weakness and smallness, like a child's. - I performed painless surgery and electrotherapy, circumcising him and treating his venereal disease. I also instructed him to purchase "Shengzhisu" Pegenelin from the Sino-Western Pharmacy to restore his seminal glands and promote the development of his sexual organs and body. His kidney failure and premature ejaculation were cured one after another. His relationship with his wife is better than at the beginning of their marriage. Recently, Mr. Yang introduced Mr. Chen Henggao to me to treat white turbidity and premature ejaculation. He said that he had learned that Mr. Yang was happy to have a son.</p>
<p>(2) White Turbidity is Cured, Premature Ejaculation Heals</p>
<p>Electrotherapy is Painless. Famous Medicines Have Great Effects.</p>
<p>Patient Chen Henggao. Thirty-two years old. Local. In business. - Mr. Chen liked to indulge in pleasure, resulting in excessive indulgence. He contracted premature ejaculation. Three or four months ago, he had sexual contact with a foreigner and contracted malignant gonorrhea. The situation was very serious. Due to concerns about his reputation, he secretly purchased □□□□ and other drugs to take, but they could not be cured. The virus entered his body, causing frequent urination, swelling, and stinging pain. He was miserable. Later, he was introduced by his close friend Mr. Yang to be treated. - I observed that Mr. Chen's seminal glands were severely damaged. Without a combination of electrotherapy and medicine, it would be impossible to achieve a rapid and complete cure. He instructed the Huamei Pharmacy to purchase "Shengzhisu" to treat his premature ejaculation. Because Mr. Chen suffered from bone pain, I mainly used "Jiangsideng's Bone Pain Pills" to treat it. With electrotherapy and medicine, in less than a month, the white turbidity and premature ejaculation were cured one after another, and he regained his health.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Clinical Examples of Kidney Disease</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, Shanghai</p>
<p>Stomach Pain, Bone Pain, Back Pain</p>
<p>Fatigue - Pain - Various Diseases!</p>
<p>Patient Wu Fangchun. From Huangyan. Thirty-six years old. In business. (Chief Complaint) Stomach pain, joint pain, kidney deficiency, and back pain. (Medical History) - Mr. Wu was ignorant of hygiene and committed early masturbation. He had frequent nocturnal emissions and ate rotten food, resulting in severe stomach acid. In addition, he contracted gonorrhea, which was not treated properly. The remaining toxins were not cleared, resulting in bone pain. Last winter, he was introduced by his close friend Mr. Fang to be treated. (Treatment) - I instructed him to purchase "Weitongling" and "Jianweisu" from the Wing On Company's Western Medicine Department to treat both the symptoms and the root cause of his stomach ailment. He took "Jiangsideng's Bone Pain Pills" to treat his bone pain, and "Ximitu's Spermatostatic Pills" and "Shengzhisu" to treat his nocturnal emissions and weakness. Because the medication took care of all aspects, all the symptoms disappeared completely after taking it for about a month.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea, Amenorrhea, Infertility</p>
<p>Hidden Disease - Weak Body - Loss of Beauty!</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Luo Jiansheng. Twenty-seven years old. From Jilin. (Chief Complaint) - Leukorrhea, irregular menstruation, abdominal pain, infertility, weak body, and premature aging. (Medical History) - Mrs. Luo was born weak and sickly. Treatment and supplements were ineffective, resulting in irregular menstruation. From the age of twenty-four, her menstruation suddenly stopped. When it came, it was like a trickle. She also had leukorrhea. She came for treatment last autumn. (Treatment) - I mainly used "Female Shengzhisu" to regulate menstruation and strengthen her body, and "Liaodailing" externally to reduce inflammation and cleanse the discharge. Mrs. Luo should specifically purchase it from the Sino-British Pharmacy and follow the instructions for internal and external application. Because "Female Shengzhisu" has the most satisfactory and miraculous effect on various gynecological diseases, Mrs. Luo's symptoms disappeared, her breasts developed, and she quickly regained her health and beauty. It has recently been heard that she is two months pregnant.</p>

<h3>Li Huitang and Feng Jingxiang</h3>
<p>Our country's soccer team attending the World Games has been selected in Hong Kong. They have had three trial performances and the results have been very satisfactory. This afternoon they will perform again in the Shen Garden, showcasing the strongest lineup of national players before our eyes. After a month of quiet and loneliness in Shanghai's soccer world, fans will once again be stimulated and excited. The lively scene at Shen Garden today can be imagined. Undoubtedly, every fan is filled with joy and excitement.</p>
<p>Li Huitang, the soccer king admired by soccer fans across the country, has been honored as the team captain this time, which is of course a well-deserved honor. This will probably be the last soccer stage of his life. It is expected that after he returns from Europe, he may not perform on the soccer field again. This is a good opportunity. It is worth commemorating such a glorious retirement. His life in the soccer world has indeed been successful. His dream of going to Europe for many years has now come true. His personal aspirations have been achieved, and Chinese soccer has reached another stage of expectation.</p>
<p>This selection was indeed very prudent and achieved ideal satisfaction. According to Zhou Jiaqi, only Jia Youliang was relatively hesitant. In fact, it is giving a good opportunity to someone who can be cultivated. Jia Youliang is the most ideal and standard new talent.</p>
<p>New and old players each account for half of the entire team. There are many people who have been playing soccer for nearly ten years or more than ten years. Their skills have not declined to this day, which is truly admirable. Especially Feng Jingxiang, who has always grasped his golden age. This was given the most honorable criticism by the selection committee in several performances in Hong Kong. Once the ball is on his feet, it is like being sucked in by suction. He never lets it go and rushes around. Relying on his sensitive intelligence, he creates opportunities for the other forwards to be active. In particular, Li Huitang's scoring goals mostly benefited from Feng. But he knows that he is not good at attacking, so he never shoots at the goal. In several preliminary competitions in Hong Kong, he only shot at the goal twice, and none of them hit. Although Li Huitang's skills have regressed a lot, he has been able to get the final victory for the team with his unique shooting skills due to Feng Jingxiang's strong assistance. Therefore, in the strongest forward line, Feng and Li are indispensable.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng is slender and has the appearance of a scholar. Usually, no one can tell that he is a soccer player. However, his refined soccer skills and brave combat are truly amazing.</p>
<p>The entire Chinese team lacks the position of right inside forward. Generally, center forward Zhang Xianyuan must be used. Zhuo Shijin is a rising star, but he may not be able to grasp it.</p>
<p>This soccer team is the first time that the national elites have united in recent years. Its strength is far above the team that participated in the tenth Far East Games in 1934. Although most of them are still those players, there has been significant progress in technology and communication.</p>
<h3>The Physique of the Soccer Team - Who is the tallest, shortest, lightest, heaviest, oldest, and youngest? - It is a fun thing to ask friends to answer</h3>
<p>People outside are eager to know the age and physique of the 22 soccer players representing our country in the World Games. The oldest players in the team are Li Huitang and Cai Wenli, both 31 years old. The youngest is Zhuo Shijin, only 23 years old. The heaviest is Sun Jinshun, weighing 175 pounds. The lightest is Bao Jiaping, weighing only 120.5 pounds. The tallest is Cai Wenli, with a height of 5 feet 11.5 inches. The shortest is Jia Youliang, only 5 feet. The average age of the entire team is 26.5 years old, the average weight is 144 pounds and 14 ounces, and the average height is 5 feet 6 inches. According to the common age of soccer players in various countries, most are between 26 and 30 years old, their weight is from 180 pounds to 200 pounds, and their height is at least 5 feet 10 inches. The speed of running, even wearing soccer shoes, is usually around 11 seconds for 100 yards. In comparison, our country is not far away.

<h3>Miscellaneous Thoughts on a Flight North</h3>
<p>— Hui Tang</p>
<p>I have flown dozens of times, but this is the first time in the skies of my homeland. I was urgently summoned by telegram from the association to come to Shanghai to participate in Saturday's competition. I hurriedly packed my bags, but not everything was in order. When I arrived in Shanghai, the early spring weather was still as if I were wearing summer clothes. When I met my friends and looked at myself in the mirror, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>This time, I took the opportunity to fly to Shanghai, an eight-hour flight. My eyes were tired, but I couldn't sleep. The book was good, but I couldn't enjoy it. The scenery of mountains and rivers was beautiful, but it couldn't hold my full attention. Thus, a hundred feelings gathered and swirled in my mind, stimulating the material for me to write this miscellaneous essay. I deeply know that my flight this time will arouse three different kinds of psychology in people: "Loving a person, one desires that they live." My dear family and friends naturally hope that I have a pleasant journey and arrive safely in Shanghai. I know that my elders will certainly bless me before the gods, my wife and children will pray for me, and my friends will constantly wish me safety. Those friends and fans of the ball game who are a little more distant from me naturally don't want me to encounter danger either. "Hating a person, one desires that they die." Those who have always been jealous, hated me, and opposed me have another kind of psychology. They will maliciously curse the plane to crash and smash me to pieces, giving them the opportunity to clap their hands and laugh. It's just a pity that their curses are not effective; otherwise, my wife would get my insurance money and become a little rich on the spot. (Omission)</p>
<p>This time on the plane, besides the above miscellaneous thoughts, I was constantly thinking about the family and dear friends who were also thinking about me, imagining everyone's voices and smiles, guessing what everyone was doing at what time, to dispel my travel boredom. The weather this time was not very suitable. We encountered wind and rain along the way, and there were many air pockets. The plane shook violently, causing people to panic. But thanks to everyone's blessings, we finally arrived safely at our destination. It was worth it to have this new experience. Now I will write down the flight procedure below to conclude these miscellaneous thoughts.</p>
<p>I received the association's telegram at ten o'clock on the twenty-second. After hurriedly finishing my office work, I took the evening train to Sheep Stone at 4:50 PM to prepare for the flight to Shanghai at 6:30 AM the next morning. My wife and children insisted on seeing me off for a distance, so we set off together.</p>
<p>I got up at 4:30 AM on the 23rd, urged my wife and children to wash up, and at six o'clock, we took a small boat to the Ersha Tou floating station. We took off at 6:30 AM, but due to heavy fog ahead, we were forced to turn back and delayed until 8:55 AM before restarting. There were two Westerners on the same plane, good companions with two volumes of "Independent Review." The plane was named "Fujian," and it was driven by one Chinese and one American pilot.</p>
<p>At 11:07 AM, we arrived in Shantou. Two compatriots took the opportunity to go to Xiamen. Later, I learned that they were directors of the Jingqiang Sports Association, Mr. Liao, and I accepted several eggs from him to fill my stomach. After refueling, we departed again at 11:20 AM.</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, we arrived in Xiamen. Two compatriots and one Westerner left the plane and landed. Ten minutes later, we continued our flight. Looking down at the valleys and plains, the rice paddies were like a hundred-patched quail coat, crisscrossing and creating a grand sight. Our country is founded on agriculture, indeed!</p>
<p>At 1:55 PM, we arrived in Fuzhou and also stopped for ten minutes before continuing our journey. The weather had gradually turned cold, and I was shivering uncomfortably. The pilot lent me an overcoat to avoid trembling. From here to Wenzhou, there were the most air pockets. A Westerner on the same plane eventually suffered from plane sickness and vomited twice. I, however, was accustomed to sailing and was spared the suffering, but I was also a little bored.</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, we arrived in Wenzhou. We encountered wind and rain along the way, and the thermometer dropped to 47 degrees. After refueling, one compatriot boarded. We continued flying at 3:42 PM. This was the last leg, and it took the longest time. The scenery along the way was beautiful. "The willows are dark and the flowers are bright, another village." The setting sun in the evening was especially lovely.</p>
<p>At 5:25 PM, Shanghai was already in sight. Looking down at the various places, everything was as clear as a painting. After landing at Longhua Airport, I put my hands together to thank God for his blessing.</p>
<p>Good friends Yu Shi, et al., and many newspaper reporters came to meet me. I learned that twelve teammates had arrived in Shanghai this afternoon before me. After retrieving my small suitcase, I drove to the "Delin Apartment" to stay. In total, from arriving in the morning until now, I had spent seven hours and thirty-five minutes in the air, stopping at four places along the way. Unfortunately, I only stayed for ten minutes or so and couldn't get to know the various places. This is a minor imperfection.</p>

<p>The 32nd Army of our country has always promoted sports. For the upcoming 11th World Games in Germany, Army Commander Shang Zhen specially sent four boxing athletes, including Wang Yonglan, to Shanghai for training in order to select two to represent our country. The athletes arrived in Shanghai in late February, and were introduced by the Sports Association to hire Western Youth boxing coach Ding Ge'er and Jingwu boxing coach Chen Hanqiang to take charge of training. It has now been two months, and the skills of the athletes have made rapid progress. They decided to participate in the international boxing competition, and except for Li Menghua, they won all the victories. Wang Yonglan and Jin Guidi were especially satisfied. A reporter from the Guoguang News Agency met with coach Ding Ge'er yesterday, who said that since he trained the four athletes, the results have been quite satisfactory. Wang Yonglan and Jin Guidi have made rapid progress and will represent the country in the World Games. Although Li Menghua has worked hard in practice, he has recently been ill, which has greatly affected his performance. He also plans to travel along with them when they go abroad to observe. Jin Guidi has returned north for treatment due to appendicitis. After the representatives go abroad, they will invite local famous boxers to compete in Hong Kong, Java, the Philippines, India, and other places along the way to increase experience. He also said that with the strength of Wang and Jin, although there is no hope for a championship in the World Games, they can still compete with equal athletes. In the future, they will introduce what they have learned in China to promote the sport, which will not be in vain. He may also go with them at that time to provide guidance at any time and to negotiate competitions along the way.</p>

<h3>Securities: Last Day of the Month: Public Bonds Have Slight Rivalry Between Bulls and Bears: Market Prices Rise and Fall According to the Chips of Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange was the last day for futures trading this month. Due to the imbalance of chips between the bulls and bears in the market, there was still intense short covering and long squeezing. Each gang entered the market, each taking different standards for entry and exit based on their own considerations. Because there was only this one day in April, most of the short positions with no goods to deliver had to offset or swap at market prices. Moreover, because this was a situation of high prices in the near term and low prices in the distant term, the bulls and those holding spot goods took the opportunity to sell near and buy far. Therefore, the market situation was volatile and uncertain. Furthermore, as the tea and cocoon markets were approaching, the use of funds in the financial sector was gradually expanding. Most of the previous arbitrage transactions were ready for delivery, so the market prices had already seen a slight easing. Starting today, the trading in April has stopped, and the market will only trade in May futures for one month. The trend has already broken away from the shackles of the April squeeze, and may fall slightly. As for yesterday's situation, the opening in the morning was entirely a short squeeze situation, with various near-term prices rising by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. In the second session, although there were sell-offs in items such as 35 and 48, items C and D were still short squeezed, while the rest had turned into long squeezes. Market prices were still uneven, with highs and lows ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was still a long squeeze, with only item C having a slight short covering, with high prices in the near term and low prices in the distant term. The rest had become a situation of falling prices in the near term and rising prices in the distant term. This was caused by the high market prices. For example, items A and B repeatedly saw new high prices in the morning, but gradually weakened in the afternoon. Therefore, the closing was still a chaotic picture, with highs and lows intermingling. As a result of the market prices, item E and item A in the current month, and item A in the distant term all rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, while the rest had slightly weakened, mostly by a little less than 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. Only item 96 was raised by 0.25 yuan due to the absorption of item 23. The total number of transactions was 85,850,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in a separate table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Although Deliveries Were Sufficient, This Month's Yarn Was Still Driven by Arbitrage</h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm, and the situation was particularly chaotic and inconsistent. Because the current month was the last day of business, and deliveries were sufficient, most of the receivers were arbitrageurs. However, both the bulls and bears continued to add chips, and the competition was fierce. The final price for the April term was 204.1 yuan, which was 1 yuan higher than the 203.1 yuan of the previous month.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Near and Distant Terms Are Uneven</p>
<p>In the opening of the premium yarn market in the morning, the prices for each month were flat, and the situation was still scattered. However, the large-scale bulls remained calm, so the trading in the market was particularly quiet. However, because the one-month term was the last day, and deliveries were abundant, people were bearish, and a certain bank used 2,000 bales of floating goods for arbitrage. As a result, market sentiment was boosted, and the market situation became firm. However, after the second session, it was heard that spot yarn trading was sluggish and began to decline. As a result, the distant months all fell by 2.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while the current month rose by 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon opening, there were many arbitrageurs in the current month, and the market situation became tighter, stabilizing market prices and bringing the distant months to a flat level. As a result, the April-May term rose by 0.47 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the distant term rose by 1.4 yuan. It was found that Changfeng sold 2,000 bales, Zhenda 400 bales, Runkang 400 bales, Jinghua 800 bales, Yongchang 600 bales, Jinkang 500 bales, Chengji 800 bales, Renfeng 550 bales, Xicheng 450 bales, Hengchang 500 bales, and Dachang 500 bales. Jinchang bought 1,550 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, Senkang 800 bales, Yichang 1,850 bales, Dafu 700 bales, Hexing 1,000 bales, and Shenji 400 bales. Tonghe 500 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the month of January are listed below.</p>
<p>More than 400 Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn were relatively clear. It was found that the statistics for all gangs' purchases throughout the day were only 405 bales, and the selling price rose by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed below.</p>
<h3>Bulls Receive Large Quantities of Goods: Cotton Suddenly Rises in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>This week was the last day of business in the cotton market, and there was fierce competition between the bulls and bears. The cotton inspection office approved 141,000 dan of cotton, of which coarse cotton accounted for the majority. The competition in the final session was even more intense. The shorts suppressed the market to a shouting price of around 1 yuan. The bulls, seeing the surging situation, also tried their best to resist, sweeping up the goods at market prices, and a rebound was immediately seen. The closing price for the last session was then 15 yuan, which was 1.05 yuan higher than the 43.95 yuan of the previous month.</p>
<p>This Month's Cotton Raised to 5 Yuan at Closing</p>
<p>At the opening of the premium cotton market in the morning, the supply of spot goods for this month was prepared sufficiently, but the banking sector and the remaining merchants all accepted it, so the situation for this month was seen to be tight and expensive. The distant months rose as a result. However, after the second session, due to the lack of strength in the yarn market, the general cotton merchants tended to go short, and the suppression was particularly strong. By the closing of the third session, the market trended downward again. As a result, the current month rose by 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the distant months fell by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. The atmosphere was mediocre at the opening in the afternoon, and the market discussion consensus was bearish. However, by the time of the closing, the situation for this month was surging. The selling voices were strong, and Yichang dragged in 10,000 dan at market prices, and Tongji absorbed as much as possible. The shouting price rose from 3 yuan to 5 yuan. The distant terms rose sharply. As a result, the current month alone rose by 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price for each month, and the distant terms rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. It was found that Tongji alone purchased 56,100 dan in the afternoon. Juxing, Yuda, Qingfeng, Changfeng, Xincheng, Changhe, and Xinting all sold 4,000 dan to 6,000, 7,000, and 8,000 dan. Changhe sold 4,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,900 dan, Xincheng 8,800 dan, Changfeng 5,000 and 100 dan, Yede 2,500 dan, Jiyan 2,700 dan, Xinchang 6,900 dan, Dafu 2,600 dan, Juxing 6,500 dan, Yuda 7,100 dan, Gengfeng 4,400 dan, Yuanji 2,900 dan. Tongji bought 58,800 dan, Hexing 3,300 dan, Gengfeng 1,800 dan, Dafeng 3,300 dan, Mingde 1,200 dan, Xicheng 2,400 dan, and Yikang 1,200 dan. Jinkang 1,200 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Only Outer Factories Are Purchasing Spot Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is ordinary. The needs of outer factories are slightly active. The sources are 308 bales of Yaohua and 60 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Is Firm and Steady, While British and Indian Cotton Both Fell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market conditions were mixed. The prices for each month rose by 1 pound or fell by 7 pounds. In the early morning, the old cotton fell in price due to bad news from Liverpool and the sale of cotton by the National Cotton Office. Later, the market recovered due to industry short covering. The new cotton was relatively firm due to the lack of rain in the west. However, the eastern part has recently received rain, and the textiles have been more active due to the reduction of work in yarn factories. There was a period of rise and fall in the middle due to industry purchases and bull liquidations. The closing was firm and steady. The spot price rose by 3 pounds, and the futures price rose by 1 to 4 pounds. British cotton spot and futures both fell by 1 point. Indian cotton merchants and European exporters sold off Bai Luoxi new cotton, but speculators took it all in. The estimates for the flat fruit are: Pingguo fell 3.5 to 3.75, Om La fell 0.75 to 1 rupee, and Bai Luoxi fell 1 to 1.25 rupees. Original telegraph green left (23rd telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the peak measurement for Bai Luoxi cotton on the 24th was 203 rupees for the April-May term and 204.5 rupees for the July-August term, both down 1 rupee from the previous day. The next year's April-May term was 200 rupees, up 1.25 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Three Commodities of Yarn and Cotton Were All Weak</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 24th: The three commodity futures yarn fell 0.2 to 0.6 yuan. The near month was 155.6 yuan, and the distant month was 196.8 yuan. The period cotton fell 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The near month was 65.15 yuan, and the distant month was 61.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Affected by Smuggling: The Sales of Cotton Cloth in South China Are Shrinking Daily</h3>
<p>Although the cotton cloth market has seen continuous purchases in various regions such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, the Yangtze River, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangdong, the southern ports such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Shantou are experiencing social and economic decline. Furthermore, the recent trend of smuggling is increasing, and tax-evading cotton cloth is occasionally transported in. Although the local standing bureaus have strictly investigated and dealt with it, the results are still not effective, resulting in a daily reduction in the amount of cloth transported from Shanghai. The northern ports such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai are also affected by the same situation, and sales have fallen sharply, resulting in a large amount of various piece goods stored in Shanghai, and the future is not easy to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Silk Prices Fall: It Is Even More Difficult for Chinese Silk to Approach Foreign Sales</h3>
<p>Japanese silk has fallen sharply in the United States. New York silk prices have just continued to fall. Yesterday's spot price opened at 1.575, down 0.04 yuan from the previous day. Yokohama's spot price fell sharply by 28 yuan. Chinese silk still wants to maintain prices for foreign sales, so there is no improvement. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm received a telegram from overseas, but the quoted price for self-factory 20.22 grade silk for delivery in July and August was only 550 yuan, which was really difficult to approach. The customer, Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, imported 15 bales of self-factory silk at a price of 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Mao Feng Tea Has Been Opened for Sale One After Another</h3>
<p>Hangzhou is a central location for tea shops and tea businesses. Since the listing of Lion Peak Longjing tea, the pre-Qingming Mao Feng tea has also been opened for sale one after another in recent days. According to news received by local merchants in this city, the price of the top-grade Mao Feng tender tip is 240 yuan, and the price of the second-grade bud tea is 180 yuan. Currently, tea merchants from Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian are gathered, and the market is quite stable.</p>
<h3>Qimen Tea Picking Is Already Prosperous</h3>
<p>Since the Qimen new black tea began to be picked last week, the production was initially scarce due to the cold weather. In recent days, the weather has been sunny and rainy, and the tea buds have been sprouting vigorously. Tea farmers in various villages are very busy picking tea, fearing that the tea body will become old. A large number of new goods have flooded the market in places such as Qishuli, Lishishan, and Kengxia in Qimen. The first-grade white tip is opened for sale at Hao Jiament Estate, ranging from 75 to 80 yuan per dan. The selling price for mature tea shipped to Shanghai must be outside the 200 yuan range.</p>
<h3>The Sales of Suian New Tea Are Greatly Stagnant</h3>
<p>In Suian, Zhejiang Province, the tea-picking areas have been very busy picking branches and leaves for the past two days. Tea companies and estates are collecting green leaves, and the selling price must be 76 or 77 yuan per dan. At first, people's hearts were prosperous, and there was no stop in the daily outflow of goods. However, since the news of the suspension of remittances from Shanghai tea shops was telegraphed, the attitude of tea merchants suddenly became depressed, and most have temporarily stopped their business. Sales have stagnated greatly, and tea prices have plummeted to 65 or 66 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: The Flour Market Was Firm and Expensive This Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened in the morning, with the prices for each month being initially firm in the near term and flat in the distant term, and then becoming tighter and more expensive. The quoted price for foreign wheat was down by 2.3 yuan in Chicago and 1.2 yuan in Canada. At the time of opening, the current month's factory codes were very scarce. Small inland factories were successively advancing to offset the delivery, which was near. The opening price was 0.45 yuan, which then rose to 0.65 yuan. The quoted price for distant-term inland and foreign wheat was tired, and it had been soft. Later, the selling atmosphere was not smooth, and it returned to stability. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the highest price for this month was 0.7 yuan, but there were not many transactions. Large factories had sold at a discounted price, so it did not continue to be good. The distant terms were inevitably affected by the firmness of this month due to the cold weather. The opportunity for development will only come when the new wheat enters the market.</p>
<h3>期麥後市略緊　新麥登塲尙早</h3>
<p>The wheat market's future is slightly tight; the new wheat crop is still early.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat market, after the morning opening, prices for all months were generally stable. Although imported wheat was quoted a little higher, by one, two, or three jiao, the domestic new wheat crop still needs a month before entering the market. Most customers are unsure of the outcome, so trading volume was low. Therefore, both the volume of transactions was limited and the market atmosphere was not easily relaxed. By the afternoon session, transactions for all months remained sluggish. However, spot transactions were slightly brisk, and asking prices were also somewhat tight, about three or four fen higher than the previous day. The spot wheat market remains largely unchanged. Wheat from Kai Nan, Suzhou, Shandong Yaowan is at five yuan and three jiao, from Fuxin's thousand packages, it is said.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat is expected to have sporadic exports and the needs of factories are slightly increased. It is expected that the market will continue to fluctuate based on daily weather reports.</p>
<h3>厚早粳再跌角許</h3>
<p>The thick early japonica rice fell again by a jiao or so.</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, arrivals from various sources totaled only twenty-odd parties, with a total of over five thousand shi, mostly thin rice. Therefore, although the Baowei (wholesale) market had Tianjin brokers taking two thousand plus packages, the market remained stable. Sales of thick early japonica rice within this district are sluggish, and prices fell again by a jiao or so. Du Yang tip rice also depreciated by several fen, showing a declining trend.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, twenty-six or seven boats arrived from the river areas. Among the goods on the market, the sale of white japonica rice was sluggish due to slow retail sales, and the price was slightly weaker by three or four fen compared to the previous day. Yang Xian rice was scarce and sold actively, with the price rising tightly by four or five fen. The Baowei market for top-quality thin rice was slightly active, and the price held firm. There were continued retail sales of Yinbian Yuan rice, and the market was stable. Sales of Ke Jian tip rice were sluggish, and the market was lackluster. The prices of other goods were all stable.</p>
<h3>客秈囤貨亟亟求售</h3>
<p>Merchants eagerly seek to sell their stock of Ke Xian rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Ke Xian rice was not robust, and sales were slow. Furthermore, with the weather gradually becoming hot, some merchants are eager to sell, especially Wen Tai rice. Therefore, although a few merchants and domestic customers intend to hold firm, it is difficult to support the market. As a result, the prices of all grades of rice declined by several fen. In the future, due to weak actual sales and fragile market sentiment, prices may gradually decline. Throughout the day, 506 packages of Gan rice, 512 packages of Wen Tai rice, 175 packages of Yong Yuan rice, and 500 packages of Siam rice were sold. Except for Yong Yuan rice, which was bought by Quanzhou brokers, the rest were bought by brokers in this district.</p>
<h3>海味　淡菜缺貨行市頗緊</h3>
<p>Seafood: Dried mussels are in short supply, and the market is quite tight.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of dried mussels, and the production areas are also wide. Domestic Ningbo goods include Jian Dan, Gong Dan, Zi Dan, and San Si Gong, as well as salted products called Lu Cai. Japanese goods include Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Mikawa, Orchid, and Purple Flower. Luzon dried mussels are divided into large and small sizes, with the largest called Chu Ban, followed by Yi Hao, Er Hao, and San Hao. However, Russian goods from Vladivostok are not graded and are called Ling Song Dan in the trade. Currently, the inventory on the market is incomplete, with various grades missing, resulting in a shortage of goods to meet customer demand. Therefore, the market is very tight. Recently sold prices include Nagasaki goods at eighty yuan for large sizes and seventy-four yuan for medium sizes. Mikawa dried mussels are at eighty-five yuan, Luzon Chu Ban dried mussels are at fifty-four yuan, Yi Hao at fifty yuan, Er Hao at forty-five yuan, San Hao at forty yuan, and Ningbo Zi Dan at fourteen or fifteen yuan. Other grades are currently out of stock.</p>
<h3>糖市　與糖標價各小五分</h3>
<p>The sugar market and the sugar tender price each decreased by five fen.</p>
<p>There was little change in the market for domestic Chao sugar yesterday. With the Shantou exchange rate fixed and the inventory in Shantou low, prices were stable. Therefore, goods here were unwilling to show weakness and remained firm. Only twenty packages of ordinary Xiao Yang were sold at thirteen yuan and four jiao, and a hundred or so packages of red sugar were sold at twelve yuan and four jiao to twelve and a half jiao, a decline of two jiao. In addition, a small amount of Xinghua gang Gao Jing red sugar was sold at ten jiao. It was also rumored that over a hundred packages of mixed Lu Qing sugar were sold privately, but due to its poor quality, it would need to decrease in price by nearly one yuan to match the price of new goods.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative had its tender settlement date yesterday. The total amount of Guangdong sugar was 4,490 packages, and the tender price was five fen lower than Wednesday. However, the transaction volume was still low, with only 260 packages of Wuyang coarse white sugar from Yiyiguan Factory sold at twenty-one yuan and eight jiao, and 161 packages from Shunde Factory sold at the same price. In addition, No. 4 cotton white upper package sold at twenty yuan and eight and a half jiao. Other products, such as Quxi coarse white at twenty-one yuan and six jiao and No. 2 cotton white at twenty-one yuan and five fen, and coarse sand at twenty-five jiao and a half, all lacked transactions. The guild quoted the original prices for No. 24 coarse white and Dong Chi Bai Ben cotton white, with no changes, and no transactions were reported.</p>
<h3>南北貨　金針菜後市有希望</h3>
<p>North-South Goods: There is hope for daylily in the future market.</p>
<p>Currently, with continued deliveries of daylily from Guangdong, the market is tight again. Yesterday, Daxing vegetables were opened at thirty yuan, Xiangzhuang vegetables at twenty-eight fen, and Xuzhou vegetables at twenty-six yuan and five jiao, with a total of sixty or seventy packages sold. Considering the thin inventory, if sales do not decline, there is hope for the top-quality goods in the future market to reach thirty-five or thirty-six yuan, in anticipation of a day when demand exceeds supply.</p>
<h3>碼生哂肉昨到四箱</h3>
<p>Four cases of Shi Ma sun-dried longan pulp arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>Recently, due to depleted inventory, Shi Ma sun-dried round meat has been out of stock for many days. Yesterday, it was discovered that the Qingyuan Wheel transported four cases upon importing from Xiamen. They have not been opened yet. If the quality is good, it will be very suitable for the needs of this district, and the market price is expected to tighten further. Moreover, the inventory of miscellaneous road merchants is also very low, so the trend is extremely firm.</p>
<h3>雜訉　海口紅皮銷路活潑</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Information: Sales of Haikou red leather are brisk.</p>
<p>Recently, Haikou cowhide has been arriving continuously. The sales of red leather are more active. For example, Sha red leather is at fifty-eight or fifty-nine yuan, and red water green is at forty-one or forty-two yuan. There is demand for both in this district. Sales of Bai Yong Qing are scarce, and the market is stable. The asking price is fifty yuan, but no transactions have been made. However, sales of Bai Yong Ting leather are not yet due, so there is no outlet, and the market is very weak. The asking price is twenty-nine yuan, but no sales have been made. Moreover, the attitude of the shops is extremely sluggish, and there are fears that there will be no special changes in the future market.</p>
<h3>取引所盛傳有復活說</h3>
<p>There are rumors of the revival of the trading exchange.</p>
<p>Shanghai once had a Japanese trading exchange, but after the establishment of various Chinese trading exchanges, the Japanese trading exchange was deserted and automatically closed down. Later, some Japanese invested in the trading exchanges in Luhan, Shanghai, and Guangdong, but they also returned empty-handed. Recently, the Japanese have been active everywhere, and there have been rumors of the establishment of a Japanese trading exchange in Shanghai for a long time. Although the matter has not been realized, a group of Chinese and Japanese merchants are secretly active to avoid government supervision and control and not to pay taxes. It is also heard that the address will be borrowed from the original site of a certain closed exchange, intending to first trade in yarn flower bidding gold and other goods, and register with Japan.</p>

<h3>關於男女工作平等</h3>
<p>On Equality in Work Between Men and Women</p>
<p>— Han Ying</p>
<p>The slogan of equality between men and women has been shouted for a long time. But there has always been a group of people who think that men and women can be equal in other aspects, but there is no possibility of equality in work. Because there are significant differences between men and women in physiology. Therefore, there are certain jobs in society that men can do, but women often cannot. In fact, this reason is not sufficient. Although there are some differences between men and women in physiology, this cannot be used as an excuse for inequality in work between men and women.</p>
<p>In ancient society, men and women were mostly equal in work. In some places now, there are also women doing men's work outside, while men are taking on women's duties at home. Even in modern Soviet Russia, the opportunities for men and women in work are equal. Recently, Chen Youren's daughter, who had lived in Soviet Russia for many years, also told people that men and women in Soviet Russia were completely equal in work. Women occupy important positions in scientific red armies, aviation factories, and other industries. If a woman's talent exceeds that of a man, she can obtain the status of a man. It was also recently heard that the German government will promulgate a decree stipulating that all women in the country should join compulsory labor this year. It can be seen that men and women can be equal in work. The current inequality is just a habit. Once this habit is removed, men and women can be equal in work.</p>
<h3>怎樣保持美滿的婚姻</h3>
<p>How to Maintain a Happy Marriage</p>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>Which man does not want to have a lover who will grow old with him?</p>
<p>Which woman does not want to be with a suitable husband for a long time?</p>
<p>However, there are many unhappy couples in the world, and unfortunate divorce cases in which people abandon each other halfway. If it starts with a blind marriage and ends with a ruthless separation, it can still be attributed to the shortcomings of the old marriage system. But it is even more unfortunate when two people who come together through their own autonomous love end up abandoning each other like strangers. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Everyone recognizes that marriage is the triumph of love in life; everyone recognizes that divorce is a tragic tragedy in life. When we read the report the other day about Jin Tongyi and his wife Li Qingzheng agreeing to divorce, we can understand the pain hidden in the heart of the other party when Ms. Li signed the divorce papers with "tears streaming down her face," when one party has a new love and turns a blind eye to the other.</p>
<p>According to statistics from Dr. Paul Popenoe of the United States, the factors that easily lead to divorce between men and women are: 1. poor physical and mental health; 2. lack of permanent property; 3. no children; 4. solitary personality, not good at falling in love; 5. misunderstanding of love. Such men or women are often candidates for divorce cases. Healthy and lively physical and mental health is a basic condition for creating a happy marriage. Many divorce cases are due to the weakness of one of the men or women, which leads to mental illness, which leads to unpleasant married life, love is sentenced to death, and it is easy to embark on the road of divorce. In this situation, it is best for both parties to maintain a pure and noble spiritual love. Smart husbands! Virtuous wives! If you are dissatisfied with the weak body of your partner, instead of going to a lawyer, you should visit a good doctor; instead of going to court, you should send him or her to a sanatorium. In this way, it may be possible to make up for the regrets of this life.</p>
<p>How to Maintain a Happy Marriage</p>
<p>"Gold cannot buy a beautiful woman's heart." This old saying reflects that property is not a safe for maintaining love. There are divorce cases in which both parties are wealthy and powerful. But if everyone is destitute and has nothing to his name, then there is even less talk of marital stability and solidity. Real estate is the anchor of marriage. Wandering proletarians can only form short-term marriages. If even a "cottage hiding a beauty" cannot be done, how can they be prevented from becoming "drifting dust on the road"?</p>
<p>The relationship between husband and wife is often strengthened by the birth of children. Having no children is also one of the factors that constitute divorce. In the old etiquette of our country, "seven outs" included "no children" as the first item. According to American statistics, there are more than three times as many divorce cases without children as with children. There are many couples who are at odds, but they are easily reconciled for the sake of their children, which is the reason for this.</p>
<p>The love between husband and wife, although it comes from nurture, is actually a combination of souls and a lifelong companion. Both parties must be willing to fall in love with each other, without resorting to excessive intimacy, in order to maintain the roots of love and make it flourish and grow. Those who have read biographies of famous people in this country have all praised Liang Hong and Meng Guang for their mutual respect. Those who have read Six Records of a Floating Life have all admired Yunniang's gentleness and loveliness towards Shen Sanbai. These are all internal elements that create a good couple.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding of love is especially common among infatuated men and women in the city. City life is extravagant. Young men and women living in the city are most easily tempted by material desires, change their minds easily, like the new and dislike the old, and their tricks are unusually unusual. In all fairness, on the men's side, who does not hate the unfaithful woman who is fickle? On the women's side, who does not hate the unfaithful man who flirts with women everywhere? The number of divorce cases in the city often exceeds that of those living in the countryside by many times. To prevent leakage of electricity, it is better to move to the countryside.</p>
<p>In short, to maintain a happy marriage, not only should you be careful about the conditions of marriage, but also understand each other and be sincere in your relationship in order to avoid the mistakes of divorce.</p>

<h3>朱君毅夫人談家庭生活</h3>
<p>Mrs. Zhu Junyi Talks About Family Life</p>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Family finances must maintain a fixed budget, develop instincts, and take the family as a starting point. School and family life are like one.</p>
<p>— Daughter's Sutra Worthy of Attention —</p>
<p>The day after Children's Day, I was about to pack up and return to Shanghai when I suddenly remembered Dr. Zhu Junyi, whom I had not seen for a long time, and thought I should visit him. This would serve two purposes: first, to have a heartfelt conversation after many years of separation; second, to ask Mrs. Zhu for her opinions on women and the family. Their family can be said to be simple, practical, and different from others. Dr. and Mrs. Zhu have always lived a common life. Although he is the chief accountant and deputy director of the Statistics Bureau of the National Government, he is a senior official of the central government, but he still lives a frugal life. His wife wears plain clothes, manages household affairs, and does not change her usual state. This is very exemplary. She is also a new woman, who has received higher education and has a solid foundation in Chinese and English. Their happiness is better than others. The following is our conversation:</p>
<p>Family finances</p>
<p>After everyone sat down, I spoke first: "Most families think that managing finances is a huge problem. The needs are vast, and the budget cannot match the final account. Therefore, they are borrowing from tomorrow to pay for today. Mr. Zhu is the chief accountant, and his wife is an experienced housewife. You must have researched this deeply. Do you have any correct instructions?" Mrs. Zhu said without hesitation: "Family finances are indeed the most difficult thing to solve in household management. Wealthy families are only a minority. The vast majority of families rely on wages to maintain their lives. In this recession, income is limited, and expenditures are uncertain. The current difficulty is finances. Whether a family is large or small, and no matter how many people there are, household expenses should not only be frugal but also absolutely maintain a budget. The budget must include a savings item, so-called preparedness averts peril. For example, a family should save at least 20 percent of its income each month. Roughly, the amount of savings is often proportional to the amount of income. The more income, the larger the percentage of savings and the smaller the percentage of household expenses; conversely, the less income, the smaller the percentage of savings and the larger the percentage of household expenses."</p>
<p>"What is the standard for household expenses at your home?"</p>
<p>"We advocate not wasting and not abusing. All regular expenses have a certain standard, because neither of us has hobbies and we don't socialize much, so there are very few exceptional expenses. The percentages of expenses we set are as follows: household expenses (food, housing) account for 30 percent of monthly income, miscellaneous expenses account for 20 percent (such as clothing, books, toys, medicine, entertainment, etc.), special expenses account for 10 percent (such as helping relatives and friends and various donations), and savings account for 40 percent."</p>
<p>(2) Women's Instincts</p>
<p>"What does Mrs. Zhu think about how to develop women's instincts?"</p>
<p>"Due to the natural physiological differences between men and women, the instincts of the two sexes are different. However, they should do their best according to the nature of the business. Some things are the responsibility of men, and some things are the responsibility of women. According to the principle of 'one person does their best, and their talents are used to the fullest,' each seeks to develop their instincts. There are four types of social activities: political organizations, professional groups, school life, and family life. Whether men or women, they cannot be separated from these four activities. I think women, at least, should improve their family life. If they don't take care of their families, then a quarter of the work in society will be left unattended. After all, men have to take on three-quarters of the responsibility, and they are not suitable for managing household affairs. Moreover, the place where we women can best develop our instincts is still in the family. Although some women with outstanding abilities can also do other parts of the work, such women are worthy of our admiration, but unfortunately, there are too few of them.</p>
<p>"If there is a kind of woman who only knows how to enjoy herself and does not fulfill her natural instincts, how should she be corrected?"</p>
<p>Women who only know how to enjoy themselves and do nothing may exist in cities, but I believe there are very few of them. For example, which rural women in our country do not work? Who doesn't work hard? As for correcting those dissolute women, we must first correct the social atmosphere, promote women's careers, focus on public education, and improve the family environment. It is also a method to supplement their knowledge with proper books, newspapers, and entertainment."</p>
<h3>(Ms. Cheng Yan Zhen)</h3>
<p>(3) Family Life</p>
<p>"Does Mrs. Zhu have a certain routine for her daily family life?"</p>
<p>"My family life is like the rigid style of my student days. It has become a habit, and I don't find it boring. The time is as follows:</p>
<p>7:00 Get up and do morning exercises</p>
<p>8:00-9:00 Instruct the servant on the work for the day (such as dishes, cleaning, etc.)</p>
<p>11:00-12:00 Read books, newspapers, and write letters</p>
<p>1:00-2:00 Accompany the child to take a nap</p>
<p>3:00-5:00 Play with the child, sometimes plant flowers and plants</p>
<p>7:00-8:00 Play the piano, listen to the radio, or socialize</p>
<p>On Sunday mornings, I clean up at home, and in the afternoon, the whole family goes on a suburban trip and watches a movie in the evening. That's how it is said, but the time is not rigid."</p>
<p>"What attitude do compassionate mothers take towards their children? I wonder what Mrs. Zhu's attitude is?"</p>
<p>"Most compassionate mothers have the heart to protect their children. I also advocate a gentle attitude, but when necessary, I must also be strict and cannot relax. My children absolutely obey their parents' guidance except for normal activities."</p>
<p>"What attitude do the two of you usually take in handling things?"</p>
<p>"We are working together. Mr. Zhu is dedicated to serving the public and does not have to worry about family affairs. Anyway, I handle the daily household affairs. In addition, we still rely on mutual agreement."</p>
<p>At this point, the conversation came to an end.</p>
<h3>美國婦女在家庭中之活動　（美國通訊）</h3>
<p>The Activities of American Women in the Home (American Correspondence)</p>
<p>— Da Qian</p>
<p>To know the activities of American women in the home, one must live in their homes for a long time to have even a rough idea. There is a popular custom in the United States that families who are not very wealthy often rent out their spare rooms. There are three ways to rent a room: the first is to rent a room without providing furniture or bedding, the second is to provide furniture and bedding, and the third is to provide furniture, bedding, and meals. With the first method, there is little contact between the host and guest, so it is difficult to observe the activities of women. With the second method, you can see one or two things. With the third method, the guest's residence, food, and drink are all managed by the hostess, so the guest knows everything about the hostess's management of the home. I lived in an American family as the third type of guest and accumulated more than a year of experience. What follows is what I saw and heard during this year.</p>
<p>The host's ancestors were German, and the wife's ancestors were English-Irish. The host is in his sixties, and the wife is also in her sixties. They have two daughters, both of whom are married. The host, therefore, has spare rooms to rent. When I first entered their home, what caught my eye was the cleanliness of the house. The floors were so smooth and free of dust that I almost couldn't bear to step on them. Then I paid the room and board fee to the host, and the host waved his hand and said, "This is a matter for Mama (Americans call the hostess of the house Mama, which is similar to the way northerners call their mothers), it has nothing to do with me, don't give it to me." From this, I knew that domestic affairs were the responsibility of the hostess. The hostess gets up very early in the morning, around six o'clock in winter and a little earlier in summer. The host is always later. In addition to cooking and washing three meals a day, the hostess also makes the bed for everyone in the family. I didn't want to be pampered, so I told her that I was willing to make the bed after I got up in the morning, but the hostess still changed the pillowcases, bedspreads, and made the bed neatly once a week.</p>
<p>The hostess cleans each room using two methods: small cleaning and large cleaning. Small cleaning is done every day, and any unclean areas in each room are cleaned. Large cleaning is held at least once a week, and the walls, carpets, furniture, etc. in each room are all cleaned. The host has a house with eight rooms, and it often takes half a day to clean it, but the cleanliness is never slightly different.</p>
<p>In order to save money, the hostess often washes the clothes that can be washed herself, such as the host's, her own, and my small clothes. She washes a lot every week, but the host has never been seen doing any of it. The host also has work. He is responsible for tidying up the land in front of and behind the house, and the woman rarely asks about it. Sometimes, after a meal, when the hostess is washing the utensils, the host asks if she needs help, and the woman says no. The division of labor between inside and outside the home seems to be quite clear.</p>
<p>One day, both of the host's sons-in-law came home. The family of seven ate together. After the meal, I, as usual, showed my intention to help by offering to send the utensils to the washing place. The hostess and both of her daughters stopped me and said, "You men, please sit down, this is a matter for us women." I laughed and said, "Helping is not a bad thing." So I sent the utensils I used to the washing place. The host's two sons-in-law sat still and did not move. The eldest daughter came from the kitchen and whispered to her husband. The second son-in-law suddenly became one to send the tableware to the washing place. Looking back, it can be seen that preparing meals and washing dishes is a woman's job, which has become a custom in the United States.</p>
<p>During daily meals, the hostess prepares the meal, places it on the table, and asks me and the host to eat. Before that, I and the host just sit and wait. Sometimes, after the hostess prepares the meal, she calls me and the host in a humorous tone and says, "Come on! Gentlemen, the meal is ready!" When I and the host heard this, we couldn't help but laugh. Because the host never asks about kitchen affairs, he is completely ignorant of cooking. During this year, there was more than a week when the hostess was bedridden, and I and the host had no food. The hostess then called her two daughters to help in turn. The second daughter was at home and was not very busy. The eldest daughter's husband works in a bank, and she also teaches at a school, but she still managed to take some time to drive over and take care of my and the host's meals. However, the host could not do this woman's work, and it was still a woman's job.</p>
<p>In her daily work, the hostess reads newspapers and magazines or plays Yezi with her husband to pass the time. Sometimes she also does needlework. I laugh and say, "Mama, aren't you too tired?" Then she also answers with a smile, "We Americans have a popular saying: 'Man's work is from sunrise to sunset, woman's work is never done.'" I am a woman, how can my work ever be done?</p>
<p>Although the host and his wife have the same level of education, they both graduated from middle school, but the hostess's level seems to be better than the host's. The host also says this repeatedly. Sometimes the hostess also wants to talk to me about the algebra problems and German conversation phrases she performed in school at that time. It seems that she has not forgotten everything. However, she seems to respect her husband quite a bit. Most of the important matters in the family are decided by her husband. I remember that I once discussed with the hostess the possibility of slightly changing the furniture in the room. The hostess did not dare to express her opinion and asked me to discuss it with her husband first. After discussing it with the host, without discussing it with the hostess again, he said yes directly.</p>
<p>The situation of one family and the actions of one person are obviously not enough to generalize to the rest. However, labor is very expensive in the United States. A maid who only comes to clean for a few hours a day still has to pay a salary of dozens or even hundreds of yuan per month. Therefore, even in the homes of professors in literary schools, there are usually no maids, and housework is still not neglected. I have visited the homes of American friends of all ages, no less than dozens of places, and the interiors are all very clean. This can also be a help in discussing the activities of American women in the home.</p>
<h3>Women's Hygiene During Pregnancy</h3>
<p>— Yi Lu</p>
<p>——Several Things Not to Be Ignored——</p>
<p>Pregnancy is a very common thing for women, but for first-time pregnant women, pregnancy is seen as a fearful thing because of a lack of experience. In addition, there is a common saying: "Sailing a boat and riding a horse are three parts fate, raising a child is like walking on the edge of a coffin," which adds another layer of fear to first-time pregnant women. In fact, this kind of psychology has a great impact on the future of childbirth. Therefore, husbands should give their first-time pregnant wives considerable explanation and comfort. Because women during pregnancy are indeed very prone to illness, if it is determined that they are already pregnant, it is best to go to an obstetrics hospital for a full body examination to see if there are any symptoms, and whether they can give birth safely. Are there any dangers to the pregnant woman and the fetus? If there are, they should be treated quickly, because according to the principles of the hospital, tuberculosis, heart disease, venereal diseases, etc., are all related to the pregnant woman and the fetus. As for vomiting, although it is a normal phenomenon during pregnancy, if the vomiting is excessive and the color is yellow, you should also see a doctor to prevent the invasion of diseases.</p>
<p>Hygiene during pregnancy is also very important. In terms of diet: it is not advisable to eat too much meat, vegetables and fruits are very beneficial. As for stimulating foods such as tobacco and alcohol, they must be absolutely prohibited. In terms of clothing: it should not be too tight, if it is too tight, the blood circulation will not be smooth! Therefore, the clothes should be loose and the temperature should be appropriate, and you should not wear too much or too little. The sleep time should be at least eight hours a day, and if you can take a nap for one or two hours in the afternoon, it is also very beneficial. In the one or two months before delivery, it is more appropriate to sleep more. If sleep is insufficient, it will affect the spirit of the pregnant woman and the growth of the fetus. In terms of work, except for the last one or two months of pregnancy, it is not appropriate to work, but at other times, you can still work. However, it is not advisable to wash clothes, lift heavy objects, or climb high, so as to avoid the risk of abortion (commonly known as miscarriage). In addition, pregnant women should not be too sad, so as not to disturb the fetal qi, and they must not be frightened by accidents. If they can recuperate properly, there will be no danger during childbirth. However, pregnant women must avoid having a fearful mentality. This is something that pregnant women and their families should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Women in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yan</p>
<p>I think the new typical Chinese women must be found in the countryside.</p>
<p>In the city, apart from some working-class women who are struggling for life and are unable to rest all day long, and are suffering from the environment, most of the other so-called typical women are of the "tai-tai" (wife), "shao-nai-nai" (young mistress), or "miss" type. They have full of charming postures, and they also have full of consuming and leisure hobbies. Their greatest skills are makeup, playing cards, and losing their tempers. As for the general female phenomenon in the city, most of them are also influenced by hypocrisy and distorted habits. "Those who are near vermilion are red, and those who are near ink are black!"</p>
<p>The women in the countryside not only have not been infected with some of the extravagant and arrogant bad habits of the city, but also have the spirit of diligence and endurance. They are worthy of praise! Each of them wears simple homespun clothes, showing an extremely frugal attitude. They all have truly healthy physiques, and can work and labor all day long without the "morbid beauty" of urban young ladies. Their skin is dark, and there are no decorations such as nail polish, foreign rouge, foreign powder, perfume essence, etc.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the east is still only faintly white, they have already pushed open the window, opened the door, and got up. Then, washing rice, sweeping, washing, cooking, etc., these daily necessary tasks begin. On the winding paths, women come and go, drawing water and pounding rice. The sun gradually shows its face from the horizon in the east. In every village, smoke from cooking swirls in the wind; this is the scenic line of the countryside morning.</p>
<p>In addition to diligently taking care of housework, such as washing and sewing, in their daily lives, when it comes to the busy farming season in the fields, they also go to the fields to help the men with their work. And those who have land often go to the market to sell vegetables and eggs, etc., to help the men as peddlers and subsidize the family. Although many of them also have young children who are a burden to them, they still carry out all their work without laziness.</p>
<p>In short, the women in the countryside have a great spirit of perseverance and endurance. Although they live in the source of suffering, they have the instinct to struggle through hardships, which is worth learning for the modern women in the city.</p>
<h3>Girls' Home Club</h3>
<p>— (He Gui)</p>
<p>New York City in the United States recently established a "Girls' Home Club." Any girl between the ages of fourteen and twenty who is in a family, or whose family is discordant, or whose environment is bad, or who has experienced an accident that has led to an unfortunate life, can temporarily live in the club. The fees are very low. Although it has only been established for a short time and has not yet achieved significant success, in the past few months, many girls have entered the club and reconciled with their families.</p>
<h3>From Boudoir to Parliament</h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>——The Rapid Advance of Turkish Women——</p>
<p>In the history of women's liberation in various countries, Turkish women have shown particularly dazzling brilliance. In less than twenty years, they have broken away from the boudoirs that bound them, abandoned their veils, and went on to obtain the right to vote and participate in the parliament that manipulates national politics. In terms of the speed of women's progress, Turkish women are indeed second to none.</p>
<p>Saying that the backwardness of Turkish women before liberation was due to the influence of Islam is a traditional misunderstanding. When Muhammad had not yet descended, Turkish women did live the most miserable lives. Regarding the preference for sons over daughters, the killing of female infants, and polygamy, these existed long before the founding of Islam. The "Quran" actually speaks out for women; in this classic, we can find sentences about equality between men and women. Even regarding the polygamy system, the Quran's advocacy is restrictive rather than advocating: "If you can treat them fairly, you can marry one, two, three, or four women; if you cannot, marry one."</p>
<p>In the early days after the founding of Islam, the women of the Ottoman Empire enjoyed considerable freedom. They could use their own private funds to engage in businesses they wanted to do without having to obtain their husband's permission; they could travel or trade; they could participate in various literary, social, and political gatherings. From the seventh century to the fifteenth century, the homeland of Turkey produced many female writers, female orators, and female professors.</p>
<p>Political corruption, male extravagance, and the prevalence of polygamy gradually lowered the status of Turkish women, restricted their lives, and deprived them of their freedom, finally causing Turkish women to be known to the world as the most backward. However, Turkish women were still fortunate, because at the end of the nineteenth century, they began to rise again.</p>
<p>During that period, upper-class Turkish women began to learn English, German, and French, and studied subjects such as politics, music, and philosophy. Later, foreigners opened girls' schools, allowing Turkish women to gain advanced knowledge. Before the outbreak of the Great War, Turkish women had already taken off their veils and accompanied their husbands to study in Europe. When the Great War broke out, men went to the military, and women replaced them in work. This was the beginning of Turkish women's engagement in occupations.</p>
<p>After the new President Kemal took office, the women of the Ottoman Empire received great favor. He abolished polygamy, implemented universal education, and advocated women's participation in politics, giving Turkish women equal opportunities with men in knowledge and politics. Currently, among Turkish women, there are lawyers, judges, chemists, engineers, writers, journalists, and city councilors, and police officers. Last year, the parliament was opened to women, and seventeen Turkish women were elected as members of parliament.</p>
<p>If the Western United States is said to be a paradise for women, then the Eastern Turkey is a sports arena for women.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Suicide of Civilization</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>On the birthday of British Secretary of War Cooper, he delivered a speech in Manchester, stating that the current situation in Europe is more serious than in 1914. The stakes are even higher, so the losses will also be greater. The only real progress we have made since the European War is the manufacture of weapons of destruction. This is tantamount to the suicide of civilization. The suicide of civilization may be seen in our time.</p>
<p>Civilization is originally an expression of cultural progress. Modern people's culture is obviously much more advanced than that of ancient times. Therefore, the twentieth century is known as the century of civilization. However, civilization today has fallen into bankruptcy. Apart from a few who use civilization as a guise to achieve their ambitions and are still boasting about civilization, many people want to curse civilization. The reason is that the so-called civilization now has lost the true meaning of civilization and has become a disguised form of barbarism. Isn't it true that even the law of the jungle is considered civilization?</p>
<p>British Secretary of War Cooper is right. The only real progress the world has made since the European War is the manufacture of weapons of destruction. Just look at what the great powers have been focusing on in recent years. It is all about military expansion. The reason why the current situation in Europe is more serious than in 1914 is because of this. In the eyes of some ambitious people, this should also be considered a manifestation of civilization. But in reality, it is tantamount to the suicide of civilization.</p>
<p>Everyone still remembers clearly the European War of 1914. During the four years of artillery fire, I don’t know how many lives were slaughtered and how much culture was destroyed. This is clearly a suicide of civilization, but the tragedy of mankind has only passed not long ago, and now various countries are preparing for a second war. A group of warmongers are rubbing their fists and eager to try. And a certain ambitious country in Europe is using poison gas to promote civilization to East Africa. There is also a friendly country in East Asia that is constantly practicing friendship with our country. There is also Germany's tearing up of the treaty, which is also a plan for foreign expansion. As for the demands for military equality from Austria, Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Greece, they can also be seen as preparations for future wars. All these facts are saying that the world is moving towards the path of civilized suicide. Although there are still many people trying to maintain peace, some are advocating the establishment of a European Federation, some are advocating the organization of a Union of American Republics, and some are hoping to achieve an Asian alliance. However, these great undertakings are only attempts by a few powerful people. The catastrophe of the world is unavoidable.</p>
<p>I, like Cooper, am worried that the suicide of civilization may be seen in our time.</p>
<h3>Sister-in-law Zhixiang</h3>
<p>— Jia Ren</p>
<p>—Hometown Chronicle—</p>
<p>The poisonous sun did a somersault from the mountain ridge in front of the village and fell down. Only a few illusory clouds and colors floated on the horizon. The cool evening breeze was blowing, dispersing the fatigue all over the body that had been attacked by the heat wave. Only at this moment did people get a breath of fresh air, and children in groups were playing hide-and-seek in the square.</p>
<p>The new moon rose like a shy maiden in delicate makeup, and the moonlight dimly illuminated the earth, tracing the black shadows of the clumps of trees across from it.</p>
<p>The women finished their housework and each grabbed a short stool and went to the square to enjoy the cool air. The mixed voices filled the space.</p>
<p>The rows of houses standing firmly behind them were empty and quiet, without a single ghost shadow. Someone forgot to bring a fan and ran home. He saw Sister-in-law Zhixiang, a pockmarked widow, alone in the corner of the eaves, under a dim kerosene lamp, her hands working non-stop at carpentry. The house was even more stuffy than during the day at this time. The person couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Zhixiang, you are really like a piece of wood. It's so hot, but you don't feel it at all. Don't you want to go out and get some fresh air? Don't cause any problems again."</p>
<p>"I have to deliver the goods tomorrow. I really don't have that kind of luck."</p>
<p>The person went out on his own. Sister-in-law Zhixiang slightly raised her head and sighed slightly. She was naturally grateful for the good intentions and concern of this person just now, but those few words had inadvertently touched the scar in her heart, making her think of other people's lives and her own life. Could she compare with anyone? No, other people all have men to support them. What about her man? He went out three years ago. For three years, she has been relying on her cheap bones and ten fingers that never stop grinding, working day and night, to support the livelihoods of her two sons and herself, a family of three. She must not be lazy for a moment. If she is lazy for a moment, she will have to go hungry tomorrow...</p>
<p>So no matter what time it is, even in this sultry season, people all leave the steaming houses and go outside the village. Only she is left alone working under that dim lamp. And until late at night, after people come back to sleep, she is still accompanied by the bleak loneliness of the night, accompanied by an even dimmer lamp, until her body is so tired that it can't support her anymore.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Sister-in-law Zhixiang raised her head again, and her eyes swept over the dark courtyard, and then came a few sighs.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of girls' crying came from outside, crying incessantly: "Zhaoliu, you son of a dead man, you short-lived ghost!"</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Zhixiang put down the needlework in her hand and listened intently. She immediately understood that the crying voice was that of A-hua, the daughter of Uncle Bao. Zhaoliu was her own child. Probably Zhaoliu was naughty again, beat A-hua, and caused trouble. Uncle Bao is a prominent, wealthy, and powerful figure in the village. A-hua is of course a golden branch and jade leaf, not to be touched by anyone.</p>
<p>Filled with anger, Sister-in-law Zhixiang quietly stepped out of the house door.</p>
<p>The situation in the square was clearly reflected in her eyes. Zhaoliu was hiding far away behind the earth wall. A-hua was still deliberately</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Crying loudly, her mother, Aunt Bao, limped with her protruding buttocks, wanting to catch up, cursing at the same time:</p>
<p>"Zhaoliu, you stinking bastard, you hit A-hua. Okay, see if you can escape to the sky. If I don't smash your dog's head, you won't know how powerful I am."</p>
<p>Although it was a children's play, it would also provoke the adults to vent their anger fiercely. And what about the people around? Needless to say, they all cheered for Aunt Bao, saying that Zhaoliu was really too naughty, a small guy who hit people at every turn, which was not allowed and should be taught a lesson.</p>
<p>With a stomach full of fire, Sister-in-law Zhixiang immediately went up, grabbed Zhaoliu's arm, like a lion grabbing a small rabbit, clenched her fist, and kept hitting Zhaoliu's back hard. Hanging him up, his feet off the ground, she dragged and pushed him back to the house.</p>
<p>Zhaoliu also cried.</p>
<p>"Aunt Bao, please don't be angry, spare the child who doesn't know how to die."</p>
<p>When passing by Aunt Bao, Sister-in-law Zhixiang respectfully apologized.</p>
<p>Aunt Bao smiled sinisterly and satisfied, and said:</p>
<p>"Uh, it's nothing. But you have to discipline this child strictly. Don't let him off cheap the second time!"</p>
<p>A trivial matter, but she vented her anger so much, look at other people's stinking faces. Sadness and self-pity almost overwhelmed Sister-in-law Zhixiang, and two pools of tears were already welling up in her eyes. Back in the house, the more she thought about it, the more annoyed she became, and she beat Zhaoliu again - the only way to vent her anger.</p>
<p>Zhaoliu cried even harder, and Sister-in-law Zhixiang sat aside sobbing silently.</p>
<h3>Village Festival</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The ceremonial guard slowly passed by, the yellow silk curtains, the purple satin ten-thousand-people umbrellas, tin incense burners, wax holders, tea carriers, eight-treasure boxes, red-clothed pretend prisoners, green-clothed little girls, the faces of living runners, the moving opera - it seemed that everyone had a little satisfaction, and they were commenting on the good or bad of the festival. A-gen didn't understand anything, first he loved every red and green thing, the "flesh lamp" looking like a piece of bloody flesh was a little sad, and the face of the "living runner" was a little scary. All the ignorant children were the same.</p>
<p>"Make way! The stilts are coming, make way! Make way!"</p>
<p>When pairs of wooden feet on stilts appeared, and vividly performed the opera, everyone's attention was focused on one point, and those in the back crowded forward, wanting to see more clearly.</p>
<p>The weight behind the short railing of the rice shop was heavy, and it was made of fir wood that had been around for many years, which had already made creaking sounds, but in the noise, no one noticed. After experiencing heavy pressure, a change occurred.</p>
<p>Those standing on the long benches in the back lost their footing and fell forward together. Those in front were suddenly startled, and everyone squeezed forward. Only a loud crash was heard, and the short railing fell down together with the people. A-gen and A-mao also fell down. A chaotic cry of shouting and weeping, climbing, pressing, stepping, there was no humanity or emotion there, whoever could stand up would stand up, and no one could take care of the women or children, only themselves.</p>
<p>When it became quiet, many people were bleeding and had broken legs. A-gen and A-mao made no sound. Their heads were against the stones of Stone Man Street, and the short railing was pressing on them. There was a lot of blood, and no one knew if it was theirs or someone else's. Those who understood quickly picked up the short railing and helped them up. Their pale faces were covered with blood, and their mouths were wide open, as if they wanted to shout, but they couldn't get it out because something was blocking them. Their eyes were white, and there was a short, quick breath.</p>
<p>"Go call A-gen's mom." A voice.</p>
<p>"What about A-mao!" Another voice.</p>
<p>"Blood! Blood! The incense ashes in front of the master."</p>
<p>"Look, such a big mouth, blood - blood."</p>
<p>! ! ! Again, a middle-aged woman with a rough voice jumped out of the crowd, her face covered with shock, sweat streaming down her head, shouting in her mouth</p>
<p>"Where? Where!"</p>
<p>"The Second Master's sedan chair is coming!" Two pairs of "Avoid," "Silence" black characters on vermilion lacquer, a bullock cart piled with paper-made silks and satins, gold and silver, and finally a sedan chair, inside a blue-faced clay bodhisattva, eyes staring strangely energetic, children staring, older children, women with their hands together in a salute,</p>
<p>"It's over, it's over."</p>
<p>Many idle people followed the tail of the festival, and those watching the festival ran around, an old man with white hair sighing:</p>
<p>"Every year, several people are injured during the festival. This year it's just two little ones, which is still good."</p>
<p>"Yes, old man, I'm afraid there are still others somewhere."</p>
<p>"Hmm! Hmm!"</p>
<p>The festival went far away, the tip of the flag could not be seen, and there was no sound of gongs, leaving a silence behind. The sugarcane sellers were tidying up their loads in preparation to leave.</p>
<p>After a while, the street was still the same quiet. No one noticed the place where the blood had flowed. A shop assistant in the rice shop often looked at the wound on his arm that was bleeding.</p>
<h3>In a Small Inn in Tanggu</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>Because I couldn't catch a boat going south, I stayed in a small inn in Tanggu.</p>
<p>The days in the inn were long, and a heart eager to go south was as uncomfortable as being fried in a pot of oil all day long. The travel expenses were limited, but the sailing date was delayed day after day, as if there would never be a ship sailing south. So this small inn became my prison, and the days became more and more melancholy.</p>
<p>At that time, it was late autumn. In late autumn, the scenery of the north country is very desolate. Especially in Tanggu, it seemed even more desolate, and even the sky was always showing a sad face, not bright at all. The tall chimneys in the factories, spewing out dragon-like smoke, with the autumn wind, slammed into the faces of every passerby.</p>
<p>I don't know why, from the first day, I hated this coastal town. Except for going to the ticket office in the morning to inquire about the sailing schedule, I stayed in this small inn all day and didn't want to step out of the street gate. During the day, there were always some lower-class guests in the small inn who were noisy and crowded there. As soon as the hawker selling candied hawthorns came in the afternoon, they would surround him to draw lots. I often paced in this small living room, looking at their red faces and red eyes, and the rude words when arguing. In this way, although the days were lonely, it was easy to pass the time.</p>
<p>In the small courtyard downstairs, there was a locust tree. Standing in my room, I could see its tip. Although it was late autumn, the leaves had not fallen off yet. In the evening, leaning against the door, watching the defeated and withered yellow locust leaves, saying goodbye to the old branches one by one in the evening wind, fluttering down, and being brought to the corner of the house, making a faint, rustling sound like an old man's sigh. Also at this time, the guest in the room across the way had already eaten dinner and sat outside the door playing that sad erhu. The small inn was quiet in the dusk, and Tanggu in the dusk was also quiet. The sad sound of the erhu rang sadly in the silence, like the complaint of a sad traveler. Hearing this sad sound, I had to turn off the lights and hide in the corner of the room to let the bitter and lonely tears flow freely.</p>
<p>At that time, I also often thought about some empty and unpredictable things, things that even I didn't know why I would think of, and then, I despaired and laughed at myself, my own weakness, negativity and decadence. Whenever the donkey next door neighed and the sound of hooves stepping on the stone slabs woke me up in the middle of the night, the neighbors' messy sleep talking, the clerks' annoying snores, the desolate sobs, and the autumn wind's wailing all made me feel endless loneliness. I was not only an unaccompanied traveler, I had grown up in loneliness since I was a child, like a migratory bird that had forgotten the seasons. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Yu Ru sat alone in the deep Fujian province, sobbing and lamenting her fate. Her eyes were filled with sadness, and her heart was full of grievances. On top of that, her foolish husband forced her to go to various mansions to solicit business. Who knew that the unfortunate fate would bring her even more torment, as she was targeted by the young master Lu Boqing, who used a trick to deceive Yu Ru. From that moment on, her father suffered many misfortunes.</p>

<p>The foolish husband, greedy for a position as adjutant, sacrificed his wife. At the same time, Wang the Tailor became an old prince, and Feng Yu Ru was tricked into a foreign restaurant in a car. She knew she had fallen into a trap, but it was already a foregone conclusion, and resistance was futile, so she had to pretend to smile and appease them.</p>

<h3>Golden City Premieres "Warrior"</h3>
<p>The film "Warrior," produced by the Central Film Studio, is the studio's first feature-length attempt. The entire film uses the battle of the Revolutionary Army's attack on Tingsi Bridge as the main thread, interwoven with romantic affairs, which are both passionate and intricate. The entire film has sound, with many aphorisms. During the screening, short films such as "Frontier Scenery" and "How Can I Not Miss Him" will also be shown, making it particularly valuable.</p>
<h3>Synopsis of "Incarnation Girl"</h3>
<p>Zhang Juweng, an overseas Chinese from Singapore, returns to China in his old age to recuperate, entrusting his son Yuanlun with the management of his business. Juweng is eager to have a grandson. Yuanlun's wife is about to give birth, but Juweng suddenly falls ill. Juweng's daughter, Minggu, urgently telegrams Yuanlun to report. Yuanlun's wife gives birth to a daughter, knowing that Juweng always valued sons over daughters, he has no choice but to telegram that a son was born, and Juweng is overjoyed and recovers without medicine. From then on, Yuanlun always dressed his daughter as a boy and sent photos to Juweng. The daughter's name is Liying, but Juweng bestows the name Shouben. Eighteen years later, Liying has graduated from middle school and is now a graceful young woman. Juweng, deeply missing his grandson, orders Minggu to go overseas and bring Liying back to the country. Yuanlun cannot refuse, so he decides to go along with it, cutting Liying's hair and preparing her clothes to return to the country to visit her grandfather. Juweng is overjoyed and shows her great love. Soon, several young men and women visit Juweng's home, and Liying begins to have companions. There is a handsome young man named Lin Songbo, and Liying is attracted to him, but Songbo regards Liying as a male friend and is already in love with the young woman Li Airong. At the same time, a relative's daughter, Zhu Naifang, is attracted to Liying's elegant demeanor. For a time, the situation in the house becomes complex and chaotic. One day, two female classmates from Singapore return to China and come to visit Liying. Liying quickly changes into women's clothing to meet them and they go to the park together. Suddenly, Songbo and others see them. Songbo is amazed by Liying's beauty and follows her relentlessly, not knowing that she is Shouben, whom he sees every day. On Juweng's seventieth birthday, Yuanlun returns to the country to offer congratulations and a performance is held. Liying appears in makeup, playing the role of a "cursing the palace" female character, and the audience all think it is a man dressed as a woman, and they all cheer, and Juweng strokes his beard and smiles. One day, Liying becomes ill, and Juweng goes to her bedside to check on her. Her undershirt is undone, and he realizes that his beloved grandson is a girl, and he is shocked and faints, his old illness relapses, and the family is terrified and helpless. After Liying recovers from her illness, she deeply regrets her actions. Juweng soon changes his mind and calls Liying to comfort her. The next day, Juweng receives another telegram from Yuanlun, reporting the birth of a true grandson, and Juweng is overjoyed and gets out of bed. His long-term illness is gone, and the whole family is filled with joy.</p>
