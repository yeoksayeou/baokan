<h3>日軍干涉河北緝私　藉口塘沽協定無據　停戰恊定絕示涉及中央及地方行政緝私行為為財務事項不受任何限制</h3>
<p>（南京）河北走私日益猖獗、以日方之橫加干涉、中國海關已無術制止、且據日方所稱、其種種干涉緝私之行爲、如不許海關入員在長城上緝私、禁止海關緝私人員携帶手槍、以及通知秦皇島稅務司、所有自蘆台至秦皇島海面之緝私船隻、不得携帶機關槍、緝私船隻不得在所謂停戰區三英里內緝私等等、均謂係依據塘沽協定、記者以茲事關係重要、日方所稱究竟有無根據、因特走訪外部某發言人、叩詢眞相、據答稱、塘沽協定、本係一停戰協定、卽結束當時戰爭之協定、轉言之、乃一完全關於軍事之協定、絕無政治性質、更無從涉及財政問題、海關緝私明明爲財務行政事項、與軍事毫無關係、塘沽協定之中、自不能有所規定、該協定業於民國二十二年五月三十一日簽字後予以公布、茲再將協定之全文附佈如决、用資研究、</p>
<p>塘沽協定全文</p>
<p>停戰協定　關東軍司令官元帥武籐信義、於昭和八年五月二十五日、在密雲與國民政府軍事委員會北平分會代理委員長何應欽所派軍使該分會參謀徐燕謀、正式接受停戰提議、依此關東軍司令官元帥武籐信義、關於停戰協定委任全權於該軍代表關東軍參謀副長陸軍少將岡村寗决、在塘沽與國民政府軍事委員會北平分會代理委員長何應欽所委任停戰全權華北中國軍代表北平分會總參議陸軍中將熊斌、締結左列之停戰協定、一、中國軍卽撤退至延慶·昌平·高麗營·順義·通州·香河·賓坻林亭口·寗河·蘆台所連之錢以西以南之地區、爾後不越該綫而前進、又不行一切挑戰擾亂之行爲、二、日本軍爲確認第一項之實行情形、隨時用飛機及其他方法以行視察、中國方面對之應加保護及與以各種便利、三、日本軍如確認第一項所示規定、中國軍業已遵守時、卽不再越該錢追擊、且自動槪歸還於長城之錢、四、長城綫以南及第一項所示之錢以北以東地域內之治安維持、以中國警察機關任之、右述警察機關、不可用刺戟日本感情之武力團體、五、本協定蓋印之後、發生效力、以此爲證據、兩代表應行記名蓋印、關東軍代表岡村寗决印、華北中國軍代表熊斌印、</p>
<p>覺書　萬一撤兵地域有妨碍治安之武力團體發生、而以警察力不能鈸壓之時、雙方協議之後再行處置、昭和八年五月三十一日關東軍代表岡村寗次印、中國軍代表熊斌印、</p>
<p>吾人苟將停戰恊定全文詳加分析、卽可知該協定之作用、僅在、　限制中國軍隊不得進駐協定第一項所規定之地域內、並　規定此地域內之治安、由中國之武裝保安隊維持、對於中央及地方行政絕未涉及、自不受任何影響海關緝私屬於行政範圍、則其一切陸海武裝之緝私行爲、不受停戰協定之任何限制、亦至爲顯然、無可疑議、日本在華軍人對於河北海關緝私橫加干涉、而藉口無可假借之塘沽協定、其違法背理、昭然若揭矣、（十八日中央社電）</p>
<p>津關與北寗路　洽商實行緝私辦法</p>
<p>（天津）林世則吉禮亞十八日上午十時到北寗路局訪陳覺生、商財部新緝私法實行事、海關以照部令、關員入站登車檢騐、遇私貨扣留、能吾發生衝突、端視路方協助吾、會談結果、將於不妨碍行車秩序中訂一恊定、日內再經詳商、卽决定、（十八日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）津關爲嚴密緝私、擬建議財部、仿閩粵辦法、在內地交通要地、多設査騐分所、稽査便利、幷請行政機關予以援助、財部對華北緝私辦法、十七晚已到津、海關對實行前、因環境關係、猶有與各方研究必要、（十八日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）前海關在大紅橋截扣走私帆船三隻、糖八百包、頃經永井日領交涉、罰欵七千元、船貨發還、（十八日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）今日路透社探悉、日當局仍要求在華北設立獨立之海關行政處、以爲合作遏止走私之代價、同時衆料數大新公路完成後、私運者可由「冀東自治政府」所轄境內將私貨由公路運入內地各處、不必假道鐵路、海關巡船刻在岐口外海濱巡緝、民船之運私貨者、皆遭扣留、至付罰欵、而後釋之、聞地方官刻仍在與中央討論此問題之政治點（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>恊助緝私機關　緝獲私貨給獎四成</p>
<p>（南京）財部曾電請各省市協助緝私、對恊緝機關、並允從優給獎、以資鼓勵、按海關定章、因眼綫報吿而緝獲之私貨、關係給獎四成、此後對協緝機關緝獲私貨、送關辦理之案現規定亦照眼綫給獎辦法、給予四成獎金、如緝獲私貨變價萬元、可給獎四千元、上項規定、頃已續各省市査照、（十八日中央社電）</p>
<p>我對走私抗議　日方竟認為無理由</p>
<p>（東京）本日外務省接到南京總領事須磨之報吿、據謂張外交部長曾於十五日以公文對於華北走私問題、要求日本政府反省云云、是以日本政府最近將對於南京政府表示其抗議、認爲毫無理由、决定與以反駁之回答、（八日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外務省發言入今日聲稱、外務省現正待南京日總領事須磨關於華北走私事之詳細報吿書、然後答覆中政府關於此事之抗議、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）外省發言人今日聲稱、五月十六日中國外長張羣所提出關於華北走私之抗議文、已由南京日總領事交郵寄出、日政府現正等待此抗議文之詳情云、中國耍求結束從事私運之日人某運輸公司、並請日政府制止日人在華北走私中之活動、此間日人以爲不獨中國、卽日本亦受華北走私之累、因日人商業亦大受影饗也、故日政府已會同中國當局就日人方面取締走私、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>英報評論走私　日方信用為之掃地</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日社論、謂日當局對於因華北走私而提出之外交抗議、作空泛閃避之答覆、足見走私之縱容、不獨爲當地軍事行爲之事件、且亦爲政府政策之有意的攻擊、據倫敦所接消息、東京不久或將以半官方式向南京建議削减關稅、或使華北稅關獨立、以作走私停止之交換物、實則華北近來事件之結果、將大有損於日本之尊嚴、彼日人平素侈稱以維持遠東秩序爲其任命者、將不能以目的在使中國唯一穩固的政府破產之政策調和其佞言矣、日本現行關於走私之政策、固以嚴重的財政損失加諸中國、但日本國家之信用亦爲之掃地云、彙聞報今晨亦批評華北走私事、謂日本勢力如及於上海、則中國海關之地位將立卽危殆、今以關稅爲抵之各種公債、其地位雖尙安全、然已屆必須採行堅决辦法、以制止此種侵蝕之時期矣云、（十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>日本增兵華北之立塲何在</h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>昨報載美國務院於副國務卿費理浦重申赫爾大綱後繼卽表示「並非對日本作外交上警吿僅聲明美國之道德立塲而已」夫美國對於日本增兵華北所有關係爲不能坐視之利益故避免外交動作而爲道德立塲之聲明在吾國則無故而受大軍壓迫之辱領土主權均被侵害要求日本解釋立塲促其覺悟撤軍實爲不可或緩之舉日本居勝利者之地位輒以互讓責中國然事至於此已過可讓之限度使易地以處日本之應付將若何當不待置答而可知矣</p>
<p>吾人亦知日本以辛丑和的爲其駐軍之根據以保僑防共爲其增兵之口實然辛丑和的第七第九兩條關於准許各國駐兵之條的意義僅爲保護使館及維持至海通道在當時之環境下或猶可說今時異勢變駐兵且無必要更何論於增駐决言保僑近年日本以特殊情勢其在華北僑民特別增加固爲事實吾人卽就事實作討論根據旣未聞有因駐軍不敷致日僑遭受扭害之消息亦未見日僑於以前若何感覺不安反之僅日本浪人依勢橫行擾亂中國之地方安寧欺壓中國之良懦人民參加漢奸之非法行動中外報紙傳載無異鐵案如此情形尙言增兵保護設問其所欲保護者爲何日人能不嗤然失笑乎至若防共則日本於此時增兵倘非失機卽爲情報不明山西之匪已勢窮竄陝由平至海通道更未聞有何赤色勢力之發展北方其他地方之安靖固不待言卽使有事中國軍隊儘有自力勦除之能力何勞日軍遠來舍已之田而耘人之田爲中國滑稽故事日本國內正感兵力缺乏而謀增編帥團乃派重兵爲中國防共用意所在能母令舉世惶惑乎</p>
<p>中國年來對日之講求親善可謂至矣撤退東北軍於陝甘以避免感情之刺戟取締抗日行動以减少糾紛進行調整國交以謀永久之親善日本政治外交經濟界亦感覺滿足紛紛談提携謀投資而軍事行動竟與廣田首相不侵略不威脅之言相背而續續發生馴至於無故臨以大隊之兵豈不滿於和平局勢之維持思有以刺激中國乎</p>

<p>（華盛頓）此間外交觀察者今日表示、數日來日本之軍隊調動、已增加日俄戰爭之危險、專家咸信日本最近增兵華北之舉動、實際上較之控制平津一端、允可注意、蓋華北可供日本作爲征服外蒙之根據地也、軍事家雖承認現有之軍隊數目、且不足爲日俄戰爭之先鋒部隊、然亦儘可從事準備軍需及航空方面之根據地云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>外務省對華文化事業、從來以東方文化之組織的研究與其發揚爲目的、而傾向援助中國學術與敎育之成功、以計日本研究中國問之發達、因如斯專念高蹈的目的、對於中日兩國民之眞正提携頗少貢獻、有田外相自其亞洲局長時代有意見、中日之間不必專事研究陳腐學問或考古學的研究、應先實行爲中日兩國民親善力之工作、據外相計劃、擬於對華文化事業實施有國際文化的色彩之工作、卽　在中國各大學設立日本語講座與日本文化講座、　中日民間各團體之經濟的文化提携、　在中國各地新設日本文化圖書館、其他積極介紹日本文化、斡旋中日體育運動·演劇·及藝術之交換、新任文化事業部第二課長宮澤事務官現已奉外相之命、視察中國各地進行準備、（十八日同盟電）</p>

<p>（東京）陸軍之最高入事、照例由陸相參謀總長敎育總監三者協議决定之、此因大正二年將陸軍大臣與次官之任用範圍、擴張至預備役退役、爲防止帶政治彩色之陸相及决官關於人事缺乏公正妥當、故有此慣例、然此决改正已無此杞憂、上項慣例亦自然消滅、以後專由陸相基於官制之各規定、主宰人事、而三長官爲陸軍之最高執行機關、則與前無異、卽關於人事、亦非意義蔑視三長官之意見、且此决改正、除去得由部外支配部內之制度、故陸軍陣容、以後可望單一强化云、（十八日同盟社電）</p>

<p>總選舉之結果右派大敗、其後强化黨勢、繼續猛烈活動、以革新國家爲其目標、　若輩認不除二二六事件根本原因、該問題未解決、對於□□對於□□之態度、及警察之取締反動派表示不滿意、　若輩亂發怪文書、對於二二六事件之當局處理方針、表示憤慨意見、又傳出擾亂軍秩及人心之種種謠言、主張昭和維新、打倒廣田內閣等、其行動實不堪憂慮、　若輩認取消戒嚴令之時期、爲自由活動之機會、現正取待機態度、（十八日同盟電）</p>

<p>番狗我在廓落克的時期、巳領略到牠的勵害、一次晚上我的僕人受到八隻番狗的攻擊、竟把他咬得遍體殘傷、</p>
<p>然而番人的狗就是咬你、你也不能打死牠、這是此地番人的規矩、打死了你必須要賠命價、有時賠償一條狗命價値會相等於人命、因爲狗是他們財產（牛羊）的防守者、但是你被狗咬傷了、狗主人一定也須出來邀你到他家裏去、說好話、陪不是、如果你拒絕他的邀請、而過後同他交涉也許他會拿一種相當的禮物、或牽一個牦牛、來賠償你的醫藥費、</p>
<p>一般番人家的狗、白天都很小心的用鐵練拴在帳房前或門口、防着咬傷行人、如有客人來、主人也必先出去攔狗、晚上纔把狗放在羊圈中、但是此地的狗、白天也放在院中亂跑、這是特種的情形、所以我們每决出門、必須提防牠的來襲、番人是以偷搶為能事的、據他們講、做賊的人也怕大毛狗、一見就吠、一見就咬、因此他們出去做賊、必先帶一袋肉骨頭、見一個狗來喂一根骨頭、狗有吃就疏忽了牠們警戒的任務、於是賊人就得暢所欲爲了、如果狗多骨頭少、沒有吃的狗還是要去咬他、他先睡在地上裝假死、狗來一嗅他的面部、以爲是死人、也就走開了、</p>
<p>海濱的野羊</p>
<p>「靑海」離開此地很近、據說祇有一站路、第二天的早晨我請管家的派了三匹烏拉馬和一個嚮導者以我們的馬鞍上都搭上一床舖蓋、和幾卷應用的相片、</p>
<p>明亮的太陽晒成溫暖的空氣、一行四人從南邊的峽谷並騎進去、谷中非常靜穆、祇聽到瑣碎的蹄聲、驚起了深草中的野兎、在山坡上跳躍奔跑、幾個不知厲害的小兎、停在馬前毫不躱避、牠們有灰色的外衣、美麗的長耳、和靈活的身段、當我們下馬想去捕捉時、牠又很乖覺覺翩然而逝了、</p>
<p>轉過兩個山坡、地勢空曠些、海風開始微微的吹來、愈往前走風力愈大、寒威也愈烈、我們的手足耳鼻都凍得痛了、</p>
<p>在遠處的山溝中、有四五個黑帳房的影子、大毛狗見着我們又在叫了、轉過去是一個山脊、頂上有一個亂石和樹枝堆成的鄂博、（蒙人的山神）樹校上掛着幾片紅色的羊毛、道是我們漫漫長途中唯一的目標、</p>
<p>走了有三十里、望見前面一片茫茫的平灘、知道海將近了、都馳着馬高興起來、忘記了身上的寒冷、手足凍痛、</p>
<p>一條山溝從坡垞上曲折的下流、直瀉到海中、河濱長滿了榛莽的黃草、我們在那裏發現有一羣三十隻野羊、在草中覓食、見着我們毫不驚異牠們不經見的長角、和灰黃色的毛皮、映着淡黃色的陽光、更顯得漂亮、現在雙方的距離祇有八十公尺、牠們都仰頭看着這一批遠來的旅人、我們也不欲驚擾牠們的自然生活、所以一照面牠們就竄上山去了、</p>
<p>這裹隱隱的望得見海岸、距離大的有十里、我們的時計上還祇上午十點鐘、預料今天能趕得回去、馬也知道人意、牠放開四蹄奔跑、一路多是平灘、似乎一塊天然的跑馬場、我們伏在鞍上祇聽到兩耳呼呼的風聲、幾隻雉鷄被我們驚起、直冲在高空裏盤旋、</p>
<p>靑海的景色</p>
<p>直到馬蹄停止的時候、我們已經在浩　的海邊、一希馬拉布灘上、海水全部凍成堅硬的冰塊、　邊藍着一層灰白的殘雪、齊海平綫眺望、海中一片皓潔的白色、耀着閃閃的陽光、感覺得刺目、沿邊有冰塊碎裂的痕跡、顯出牠堅厚而瑩潔的層次、我們踏着冰上去、平滑如石板一樣、往海中心走了幾十丈、毫未覺　危險、如果當在嚴冬、我們一定會有踏冰上海心山的豪興、</p>
<p>返視到岸上、一片細軟的黃沙、和沙漠一樣不見一根靑草、幾個童蹟的山丘、從遠處迤邐而來伸張到海邊、如像幾個海豹在飲水、</p>
<p>我們檢一些冰屑嘗着味道苦鹹、固然牠是中國最大的內陸鹹水湖、環海有六百餘里、面積一千六百方里、據有環海轉經祈禱的番人講、每繞一週須費十六天、</p>
<p>此地離開遊人常到的揷漢城還有二站多路、須要越過南邊的一個山嶺、所以遊人的足跡踏到希馬拉布灘的很少、</p>
<p>在望遠鏡中發現二點海心山的影子、在海天一色的中央、像二條小船、據領導的請、山上有許多喇嘛和覺彌子（女尼）在坐井修煉、山上很出些牛羊、而不出莊稼、所以每年寒冬結冰時、他們趕着牛羊上岸、換取一年的糧食、從海心山到岸上有一站多路、在冰上必須露宿一夜、他們上岸的時期多在三九—（冬至後二十七天）中、不然非嚴寒時間、遼闊的冰坂上很易遇到破裂的危險、</p>
<p>靑海蒙古名字「庫庫諾爾」、西藏名字一觸滾布」庫庫和滾布爲靑的譯意、諾爾和觸就是海的譯意、本來靑海是一個內陸的湖泊、中文應該寫「靑湖」纔對、</p>
<h3>農村生活叢談</h3>
<p>— 俞慶棠主編</p>
<h3>靑島漁村一瞥</h3>
<p>— 王志超</p>
<p>靑島突出海中，橫跨着黃渤兩海，內包着膠澳夭成港灣、那裏的民衆以漁爲業，實在是地理環境的使然。在沒有開闢商埠以前，就有一百六十多漁村，計沙子口區有漁村的二十多，張村區南部的八九村，台東區的二十多村，四滄區的三十多村，仙家塞區西部十多村，海西全區七十多村，每村漁戶的佔百分之七十以上，務農的佔少數，由此可見靑島沿海居民以捕魚爲業的重要性。</p>
<p>在十多年前，據日人的調査，陰島方面就有漁船三百三十艘，漁夫一千三百多名，漁獲物每年的値二萬五千元；沙子口方面有漁船三百艘，漁夫一千二百多名，漁獲物每年的値十萬元，此外較小的漁村沒有統計，在民十五年時據漁航局的調査報吿，靑區漁船有一千四百多艘，漁夫一萬一千人；後來日人在靑組織了水產組合，中國漁民加入的有九千二百多人。捕魚區域，灣內以陰島爲根據，外海以沙子口姜哥莊爲中心，東西越八千墩而達千里島，南面到塔連島水靈山島，以及嶗山灣內的石島等地</p>
<p>濱海居民，捕漁的方法，非常守舊一，並沒有任何改良。直到德據膠州灣，英佔威海衛以後，捕魚事業才被人們注意。民國三年日人强佔靑島，並常有漁輪停　　　黃海渤海洋面，任意捕魚。同時日本政府也非常獎勵，給予很多便利，所以在最盛時期，靑島的日本漁船，會從一百零八艘增加到一百三十艘，漁夫也增加了很多，日人在靑，設有水產組合，辦理貸欵販賣等許多事情，以致靑島市的漁業，完全受日人所操縱。民十六年後，渤海艦隊駐防靑島，分區巡視保護，維持海權。同時靑島市社會局也竭力提倡，勸令靑市富商組織靑島漁業公司，專事辦理一切水產品的交易；然而所有這種種，總敵不過日人在靑的水產組合勢力的雄厚。現在靑市沿海佔重要銷塲的加級魚，（這魚是上等食品，每斤的値洋五六角）產額雖然很多，而且四季都有鮮魚出售，然大半是由日人捕獲的。每當春秋二季的魚汛期內，日人紛紛乘大腹帆船，或輪船，在海州方面捕捉，小船則往來於水靈山島，大小公島，塔連島，千里島一帶，甚至冬天魚少的時期，也滿佈着小船在塔里島的南部捕捉。一艘大型帆船每年所獲可値七千元以上，小船也有二千元以上的收入。我國漁船所獲，眞不能與他們比擬。日人所用的捕魚工具，是繩釣，打網，升網，流網，潛水器等等，所捕的魚除加級魚最多外，還有鱶魚，比目魚，鯒魚，鰵魚，鮑魚，漁麥，石花菜等。至於運銷方面，全爲靑島漁業公司和日人所組的靑島水產組合所壟斷。在靑島設有魚市塲，一切水產物的運銷，須先通過魚行，魚行的主持者，都是漁業公司或水產組合的經紀人。在魚市塲口，以競買的方法，購進各類魚產，再行運銷外埠。靑島魚行共有義成祥，福興裕等三十四家，全年營業總額的三百餘萬元，只是行佣一項的收入，也有七八萬元。</p>
<p>近幾年來，日本漁業更有計劃地進行侵略。他們利用科學的方法捕捉，使我靑島沿海漁戶，無法抵抗，益以去年五月颶風，使漁民的網罟損失大半，以致漁業破產，漁民變成災民，飢寒交迫，嗷嗷待哺。漁船出漁，必須領照。沒有錢領照的漁戶，只能坐失捕魚的時機。一部分年來尙能支持的漁戶，也只有負債的一法，債權人不消說就是魚行，這批魚行的經紀人，仗着他的主子的勢力，將一般終年辛苦吃不飽穿不暖的魚民，壓榨得氣都透不過來。可是慣用大秤收魚或重利盤剝魚民的一般魚行，近年也弄得走頭無路；他們想不到這不景氣的襲來，是有人在後面作祟，於是只有一味的把漁民重壓，把漁民的一點汗血榨取殆盡。目前情勢更形嚴重，不但漁戶本身先後宣吿破產，就是沿海的魚行也十歇七八。沿海漁戶從前還可以舉債度日，目下連「此路也「不通」了。</p>
<p>現在再來談談漁工，漁工又名「捎水，」除工資外，每人帶網五六口，稱做「捎掛子，」只取漁利，不攤用費，這是獎勵漁工的方法。「捎水」一人，每季只給薪資十元。在五六年前，每「捎水」一人，薪資在三十元上下，連同「捎掛子」的漁收，的在百五十元左右，一家老幼，可以勉强過去，現在薪資只有十元，自備的「捎掛子，」不但沒有收益，且常有丢掉的危險，「捎掛子，」大都是漁工個人負債自備的，所得的漁收，還不能償付債息，漁工眞是要呌苦連天了！</p>
<p>一般婦女的工作，在秋冬兩季，總是「結網，」纊線，葛線，纏線，上梭子，大人小孩一齊忙，所以他們的口號是「畫夜忙網。」有結「手工」的（就是替人家結，只賺手工錢；）有結「本」的（就是用自己的本錢買線結織，）結成後出賣，按斤算價，普通價每斤八角，每口網十五斤，需耍兩個棉紗（土名洋線，）兩個棉紗的値九元，算來每口網有三元的利益。普通在秋冬兩季，每人能結網四口，可以有十餘元的收入；結「手工」每口能賺二元，這是這裏婦女除了洗衣煮飯外的唯一的副業生產。在四五年前，每口網的利潤有七八元之多，現在則不及其半，而且銷路大不如前，正業破產，波及到副業，當然是意料中的事情</p>
<p>在這年頭，無論漁戶漁工，都遭遇着悲慘的命運。血本盡失，而債台高築；耕地本來很少，又不能從事其他生產，而吃的食糧，又非購買不可，眞是死路一條。一般稍有網罟的漁戶，負債維持漁業，又受鹽的問題所束縛，就是捕魚稍多，無處買鹽，也無力買鹽，這眞是「屋漏偏逢連夜雨，船行又遇打頭風。」漁民捕魚，每百斤納魚稅三角，然後持照頒鹽，按船的大小估計魚量，計每百斤領鹽二十斤，漁民不懂得什麽，公推一押員負責領鹽賣魚。一般沒錢買鹽的漁民，所捕的魚，只得任其腐爛，這是何等悲慘的命運，有許多漁村，因爲實在沒法度日請求縣政府發給護照出外逃荒，縣府不准。但一班年壯的人，不甘餓死，都悄悄地離鄉背井，另謀出路了。</p>

<p>被控之原因</p>
<p>安徽教育、內容原極複雜、朱庭祜因將皖北數校略事整理、當即引起重大糾紛、楊廉於二十　年六月、接任安徽教育廳長、以整飭學風、破除黨派為先務、比年夏冬兩季、撤換主任人員甚多、將各教育機關、澈底加以整理、其稱贊者固認教育行政、紀綱肅然、學風純良、為安徽教育史上　十年來所未有、而失意者、自不免怨謗叢生、造作蜚語、極力中傷、故有王貫武·趙子山·等以揑造報銷、侵吞公欵為詞、向監察院呈控、經院令審計部查復、據該部稽察王衡鑑調查報告、經監察委昌王廣慶　提起彈劾、請將楊廉朱庭祜一併移付懲戒、</p>
<p>楊廉之答辯</p>

<h3>化學科講演之二　化學的應用（四）</h3>
<p>— 國立編譯館專任編譯陳可忠</p>
<p>關於毒氣問題毒氣戰爭是在歐戰時俟才有的。一九一五年德國第一次用大規模的　　，打敗聯軍。以後各國都爭相運用各種　氣作攻擊敵人的利器。在歐戰末期所發明的　　已經有了好幾十種。戰後各國仍舊努力研究　這二十年來各國發明的毒氣，當然更多而且更猛烈。毒氣的數目雖多，　其性質和用途，可以分為下列五類：</p>
<p>催淚性毒氣　催淚性主要的毒氣多半是　的化合物，如像　丙酮（Bromoaceto　　）。這類毒氣能够刺激眼粘膜，使眼睛流疼痛。有的並且能够使人咳嗽，流鼻涕。</p>
<p>噴嚏性毒氣　這類毒氣主要的是　的有機化合物，如像　苯氨　（Diphenylc　orarsine）之類。中毒毒　能够刺激氣道粘膜，使起噴嚏，咳嗽，流淚，以及嘔吐，頭痛等現象。</p>
<p>窒息性毒氣　這種毒氣主要的是　和氯的化合物，如　　　和光　（Phogene）等。能够傷害氣管　肺部。所以中毒　常使呼吸困難，面色蒼白，　的可以使必臟麻痺，　氣管發　，到了肺　水　　　死亡。</p>
<p>這類毒氣主要的是芥氣（Mu　　　　　　　　　　合物傷害人類的能力非常猛烈，不論全身任何地方的皮膚，一經接觸，就會腐爛起來。所以遇了這種毒氣，就是用防毒面具，也不能够防禦。一定要用不透氣的防毒衣服保護全身，才可以保障安全。</p>
<p>中毒性毒氣這類毒氣主要的是　的化合物，如像氰化氫等，他如一氧化碳也是中毒性毒氣的一種。這類毒氣的毒性要算最厲害，雖然吸入少量，也能致死的，　為牠們能够直接毒害神經，並且能阻止血液的　化，所以中毒後死得很快。不過這類毒氣因為容易揮發逃散，所以運用很不方便。</p>
<p>此外還有放火同發烟兩種藥劑。放火的　　主要的是白磷同鋁　劑（Thermite）。白磷同油類混合燃燒起來非常迅速。鋁熱劑是　化鐵和鋁粉的混合物，燃燒時能够發生高溫，就是鋼鐵遇到了牠都要溶化，所以要算最猛烈的放火劑。發烟的村料主要的是磷和四氯化錫等。磷燃燒後可以生五氧化磷的烟　。四氧化　是一種液體與氨一同噴入空氣中，　到了溫氣立刻變成濃厚的白烟。埯蔽的能力很大。</p>
<p>由上面看來我們知道毒氣在戰爭中的效力是非常偉大，在未來的大戰中，毒氣的應用是無可避免的。那末我們對於這巨　臨　　前夜，應當如何凖備呢？這是很値得我們深省的。毒氣製造和化學工業的關係，非常密切，尤其是對於染料工業的關係最為密切，製造毒氣和製造染料的手續有很多相同的地方，平時的染料工廠在戰時立刻可以改成毒氣製造廠。我國染料工業毫無基礎，對於毒氣的製造，當然很感困難。氯的來源全靠食鹽的　解工業，這種工業在上海已經有了一個，將來仍有擴大增多的必要。其他如像氰化物是平時醫藥所必需的藥品，砷化物也是農業上常用的殺蟲劑。德國是化學工業最發達的國家，所以他的毒氣製造也高出他人一等。我國如果要想在毒氣方面做　凖備，自非先積極提倡化學工業不可。</p>
<p>關於液體燃料問題液體燃料在近代戰爭中也是非常重要的，無論空中的飛機，地上的汽車坦克車以及運輸車等，都靠着液體燦料才能活動，譬如最近意大利處心積應的去打阿比西尼亞，世界各國曾經想盡了種種制裁方法，但是都沒有效果。據專家觀察，只有斷絕液體燃料的供給，才可以制服意大利。由此我們可以知道液體燃料在國防上的價值了。世界產石油的國家要算美國，其次就是蘇俄，我國石油的產量很少。現在把世界各國石油產量（一九三三年）列成一表如下：</p>
<p>石油</p>
<p>中國　四五三（噸）</p>
<p>美國　一二二，七九五，〇一八</p>
<p>德國　二三二，六八九</p>
<p>法國　八五，〇〇〇</p>
<p>意國　二六，〇〇〇</p>
<p>俄國　二一，四四〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>日本　三三四，二八六</p>
<p>最近兩年液體燃料輸入我國每年平均都在四千餘萬金，一旦國家有事，海口被人封鎖，就是有武器也就不能應用了。所以如何解决液體燃料這個問題是非常重要的。我國石油儲量旣不豐富，依靠他人又極危險，要解决液體燃料問題，只有靠化學家的努力。這個問題大槪可分做三方面去研究。第一，由油母貝岩用蒸溜法提取石油，據說廣東，陝西，山西等省很有希望。第二，用煤施行低溫蒸溜或氫化方法製取石油。第三，用植物油分解蒸溜。關於油母貝岩和煤的低溫蒸溜，現在實業部地質調查所燃料研究室正在努力研究。關終植物油分解這個問題，中央工業試騐所，中央大學，廣東工業試騐所都在研究。據專家談，這三種來源，關於第一種如果調查的結果滿意，當然要算最好，其次就是第二種，再其次才是第三種。因為用植物油分解，原料的價值比所製出的產物還要高，在平時是很不經濟的；但是我國出產植物油很多，假如國家到了緊急的時候，那末為了國防的關係，只能够大量的出產，當然顧不到經濟不經濟這個問題上面去了。</p>
<p>由上面所講的各項問題看來，我們知道一個國家在平時要靠化學來利用　生，在戰時要靠化學來供給一切的兵器。在平時如果對於化學事業不十分注意，那末在戰時就有捉襟見肘難於應付的苦痛。總而言之，假如說要為我們民族國家爭生存，化學事業是應當首先積極提倡的。（完）</p>

<p>誌謂、今天是先烈陳英士先生殉國第二十週年紀念日、諸位來　加紀念、應該認識與效法陳先烈的偉大、茲將陳先生一生史略報告如下、　「幼年時代」、先生生於民國紀元前三十六年、七歲入塾、自幼勇敢俠義、十歲喪父、後習當業，即覺滿濟政治窳敗、有改革必要、　「經商入黨」、先生在杭、每感內地風氣閉塞、不易發展、因特來滬、入絲棧營商、一面努力革命事業、此時正美禁華工入境、先生以為革命時機已至、遂赴長沙、至靄士先生處、商討抵制美貨、後父赴日留學、遇總理加入同盟會、改入軍官學校、　先生自入軍校後、與總理及諸同志相處、研究革命策略、不兩年歸國、在滬工作、辛亥武昌起義、滬埠響應、先生之努力結果也、　「失敗被難」、二次革命失敗後、袁逆勢力膨大、因此共推先生至西南活動、在未行以前、袁逆知先生在滬、電請領事團扣留、各領事通知先生暫避、而先生仍在滬照常工作、因有刺殺袁逆爪牙鄭汝成才案發生、袁逆更忌先生、爰買人與先生接近、以抵押煤礦為由、派凶狙擊、不幸先生遇難、觀乎先生過去一生經歷、偉大的人格、廉潔的操守、處處能為吾人模範云云、</p>

<p>陳英士紀念大會　（啟昌攝）</p>
<p>戴季陶詞</p>
<p>戴院長演說、略謂先生一生光榮之重要事蹟、悉已有文字之紀載、但先生－生事蹟中、帮助總理建立革命偉業、功在黨國、實為我人所欽仰而不可忘者也、陳先生自加入同盟會、至袁逆謀篡奪民國為止、為一生最重要之階段、歸納言之、可分為三點、　陳先生每以社會為其家、故以愛家之精神、愛護社會、此凡上海人士、尤所熟知、因陳先生之愛護社會、故社會之力量、即為陳先生之力量、此卽陳先生能造成革命之偉大力量、故陳先生為社會之領袖、　革命乃青年應有之使命、一般革命志士、在青年時期所表現之革命力量、尤為偉大、故其責任亦尤大、所以革命運動可謂之青年運動、而青年運動尤應注意於教育、當時一般革命志士、　未能受有正規之教育、英士先生即其中之一、故英士先生對於教育事業、倍加注意、使青年認識國家責任、培養青年、陳先生不但在家鄕發起學校之組織、帮助學校之發展、在上海除辦理學校外、并帮助社會教育、以及其他各種文化事業之發展、所以英士先生尤為靑年教育之領袖、　我人皆知三民主義為救國主義、革命之目的、卽所以救國、國家而遭困難、必思所以挽救之道、猶人之病、必須求醫、陳先生一生盡瘁於救國革命、以便造成一民治·民享·民有·之國家、特別努力於國家之上層組織、即政治、所以陳先生是國家政治組織之領袖、再有陳先生對於愛國愛鄕愛家是一貫、　結交朋友、能取人之長、袖人之短、種種地方、都可表現陳先生精神事業之偉大、</p>
<p>楊嘯天詞</p>
<p>略謂、我們追憶英士先生的一生、可以說、終始是站在革命的前綫、在我們中國國民革命的歷史過程上、先生是無一日、無一時、不與周圍的惡勢力相搏鬥的、尤共是在袁世凱蓄意稱帝盜國的期間、更顯現了先生畢生之革命的熱切的情緒、和不妥協的精神、卒至以身殉了黨國、可是先生之被害，是不是就是先生之失敗呢、兄弟以為先生之被害、乃是先生之成功、因為一個革命黨人、最後的自覺、原是在犧牲、所以先生是殺身成仁、並不是失敗、不過我們的黨、確實喪失了一位具有大無畏精神的導師、兄弟追隨先生旣久、深識先生革命人格之偉大、對先生宿昔維護共和、和貫澈主義、而與革命前途一切敵人拼死命的才智剛勇、以為真徒値得我們來景仰、隨得我們來紀念的、尤其是在先生殉國後　十的今日、環顧我們國族的處境、先生的精神、是更値得我們來効法、來繼起奮鬥犧牲、這樣、才不負今天紀念先生的意義云云、繼由潘公展等相繼演說、末由競雄女中學生唱紀念歌散會云、</p>

<h3>救國教育之基本原則　（下）</h3>
<p>— 載院長廣播講詞</p>
<p>這些人如果受過極嚴格的集團訓練、那麼這種防水的工作、必定格外有效、此外任何的天災人禍、如果人民有了訓練、一定可以在有秩序之下工作着、個個皆得到很好的成功、在社會上、則任何事業、皆可以進步、所以這種教育、不僅是在普通人所想的軍事上的價值、實在是在一般人民的生活上職業上社會的秩序上、尤其在國家的政治經濟上發展他的效用、在現在這種世界很大的變動之中、中國處在這種危險的局面底下、必定要能夠完成革命救國的教育、完成這種教育的要點、即是「術德并重文武變修」學術技術與主義、道德文事與武事同時並重、人人受武事教育、文事教育技術教育、修其身心道德、才司以達到救國的目的、這是去年五全六會宣言十條綱領的要點、也就是中國國民黨連續一貫的革命政策、如果大家能把五全大會的宣言、拿出來從頭到尾的仔細看一遍、就可以知道「術德並軍文武雙修」、確是建國救國的重要原則、今晚不能做詳細的講演、希望各位細細的看了五全大會的宜言、再把總理的三民主義革命著作，以及蔣先生對辦學對治軍對國民的講演和談話參考一下、就可以知道五全大會宣言的基本精神所在、此次在伯林舉行的世界運動大會、中國各方面、對他都很熟心、中國派了幾十位選手參加、中央復派兄弟代表政府參加盛會、中央此意、是在明示提倡國民體育、不僅在國民體育、實在是爲提倡整個兒的教育、就是要把過去衰頹的精神改去、希望全體國民全體同志努力、希望各選手及一般國民把各國文武並重的教育的實際情況注意、使我國今後的教育，特別在一術德並重文武雙修」的原則下、得着他山之石、得着些新經驗、以爲建設革命教育的參攷、道就是兄弟奉派出去考察的重要問題、</p>
<p>今晚在這個短促的時問當中、只能把這個間題提出來、希望大家加以研究、並且希望大家把上述中央已定的事項、切實、成、（完）</p>
<h3>告青年科學家</h3>
<p>蘇俄巴夫洛夫Povloq教授遺著</p>
<p>蘇俄大科學家巴夫洛夫氏已於本年二月二十八日在列寧格勒逝世、巴氏一生致力科學研究、其生理學心理學上之新貢獻、世界聞名、而蘇俄亦因巴氏之故、得在最近科學界上佔一極重要之地位、巴氏故後、蘇聯人民委員會决譏在列寧格勒中心廣場建紀念碑、並將列寧格勒第一醫院改　巴氏醫學院、藉以景仰先賢、最近中國科學社科學雜誌載有巴氏告青年科學家一文、虽巴氏此文係爲蘇俄青年科学家而作、而其內容實爲一般科學研究者之指導、茲特轉載於此、希我國青年科学家注意焉、（蔭良）</p>
<p>對於我國獻身於科學之青年、我之切望爲何、</p>
<p>第一循序漸進　吾人如企图有良好結果之研究、循序漸進實爲必要之條件、研究科學、必須循序慚進、循序漸進、開始從事科學研究工作時必須養成嚴格的循序漸進之精神、以爲探求學間之不二法門、如想在科學上有達到登　造極之日、必須自學習之初步始、若基本學問尚未能融會貫通、絕不可貪求新知、</p>
<p>不可以極大肌之臆側或假定、來掩飾自己之無知、須知肥皂水吹成之泡、無論外觀如何美麗、終久必自破裂、結果除自取恥辱外、實無一得、從事科學研究、必須謹慎、必須有恆心、必煩習於做科學之組淺工作、更必須研究事貿、搜集事實、比較事實、譬如鳥之二翅、實其良好之工具、倘無空氣之支持、决不能上沖雲霽、</p>
<p>事贊、就是科學家之空氣、無事實、科學家亦難有高深之造就、無事買、則一切學說終成書餅、但是研究、試驗或觀察之時、不可止於事實之表面、亦不可徒成爲一個事實之記錄者、必須設法窮探事實之根游、尤須始終不懈、尋求主宰事實之律　、</p>
<p>第二謙虛　研究學問、决不可存自滿之心、無論他人如何稱許、常須有勇氣告訴自己、「我是無知」、决不要存驕心、否則囿於成見、即遇真理、也不免妄加否認、目囚自驕之故、必拒絕有益之指教與友誼之幫助、結果必失去客觀之態席與精神、</p>
<p>我們指導之研究工作、均在一種良好風氣中、得以進行工作、同仁均本同舟共濟之精神、各盡所能、以推進此共同工作、故吾人於工作時、難有彼此之分、吾人共同工作之得有成就、也基於此種「公爾忘私」之精神、</p>
<p>第三熱情　緊記科學事業、需要吾人終身之勞力、且人生不過百年、即吾人生命能延長一倍、亦不足竟研究之功、</p>
<p>初究科學、需要絕大努力與真摯熱情、對於工作　研究、應具熱烈情感、</p>
<p>吾人應常感謝國家已爲科學家創闢偉大之研究園地、且已將科學充分灌輸生命之中、我可告訴青年科學家者爲何、即國家既已給與如許機會與幫助、國家自亦盼其作絕大努力、多所貢獻、我國青年科學家、以及我輩成年、應如何努力以副國家提倡科學之偉大企望、此實吾人榮譽攸　之問題、（完）</p>

<p>「阻隔萬里、重洋以外的全世界的男女兒童們、請在今天、接受我們威雨期男女兒責們的虔誠的敬禮、</p>
<p>「在今天這倘「親善日」我們以探險者與人類文明之開拓者的名義、對諸君獻致敬禮、在若干的海洋上、在若干的大陸上、那一般探險者興人類文明之聞拓者、他們展佈了宇宙之神秘、忍受困難、干冒危險、一心向前探尋、不知退後爲何物、他們有一些已經征服過千難萬難、有一　正在征服着千難萬難、我們正因着他們的努力、得樂享幸福與繁榮、</p>
<p>「全世界的男女兒童們、一切人類功臣的偉大成就、當給與我們以多大的鼓勵與惑動、我們豈不是應該以同樣高尚的精神、去完成一個最高貴的嘗試、去從進人類間之和平麼、在令天、我們豈不是應該重新决志、去從事於這一件最艱難而又最偉大的冒險麼、</p>
<p>「全世界的男女兒童們、根據着我們的友誼與勇敢、我們也必定能征服千難萬難啊、」</p>
<p>又據中國國民黨中央執行委員會廣播事業管理處消息、我方已於本年四月初、正式函達英國威爾斯兒童、表示中國全國兒童願與之携手努力促進世界兒童之親善、並告以中國之中央廣播電台、决定於五月十八日午後、亦播送世界兒童親善節之特殊節目云、</p>

<p>心理學書上寫得明白，審美之心，人皆有之，窮小子也是一個人，自然心同此理，不在話下，當妳們打扮得如花一般的美麗映入我眼底的時候，我審美的情緒，會得不知其所以的流露出來，說句眞話，難免，幾乎是必然的要瞟妳們幾眼，方得放心。愛美，審美，是人類的天籟和至性，似乎未可厚非吧。迎面看見妳們，粉靨朱唇，酥胸玉臂，固然使我目逆而送之；再端詳背景一下，柳腰輕擺，臀波盪漾，敎入就更有所感觸了，感觸些什麼呢？感觸的是：在昔纏足，如今高跟，毀體求容，今古同慨！</p>
<p>腰擺臀盪，是令人注意的一種現象。我斯何人？豈敢以牛頓先生自擬，像看見蘋果落地一樣想發明什麽吸引力的學說，但事態當前，總得要下一點研究功夫。觀察思維，是科學的方法；格物窮理，乃大學的道理。於是乎我隨時隨地的留心觀察，小三子的媽媽，小六子的阿姐，走起路來，不像你們那樣搖而且盪；我再窮其理，一番努力，才明白完全是妳們脚下高跟在那兒頑的把戲，別無其他道埋，沒有什麼神秘。</p>
<p>事情總是這樣，利之所至，言必隨之，害且甚焉。果然妳們着起高跟皮鞋步履之際，身段輕盈了，體態綽的了，婀娜嫵媚，動人憐愛，高跟的好處，利益，說起來眞眞微乎其微。說到害處呢，就健康上立言，足有半打之多，且看</p>
<p>身體的重心完全支持在脚尖，後跟不能着力，容易傾倒。</p>
<p>遇到不平有凹陷的地面，稍不留心，踵關節易遭捻挫，引起其他疾病。</p>
<p>骨盤內的臟器，允其是子宮，會因此變動位置，而多得疾患。</p>
<p>骨盤也可走了樣子，以致分娩發生困難。</p>
<p>小腿肌肉，脚掌肌肉的牽引力，逐漸减弱，足踵關節運動失去原有的活潑。</p>
<p>足骨下沉，脚底完全與地平面接觸，形成醫學上所說的扁平足，有時需要手術治療。</p>
<p>兩項，隨時可以發生，　以下着得時候稍久，才可成功。虛榮常常蒙蔽了理智，完全着平底鞋子，妳們那裏肯得；依據德人夏德民醫生的報吿，跟高四公分以內，上海鞋店謂之半高跟—着之尙無碍健康，也不損美觀。跟高的離奇，這又何必呢？</p>
<h3>一樣不健康的：</h3>
<h3>肺癆統計之世界觀（九）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>幼年兒童强迫檢査之重要，在挪威瑞典芬蘭波蘭諸國，俱已注意及之矣。</p>
<p>此外大規模之檢査，在美國亦有不少之報吿。Ferguson氏以爲大學生患結核者有二至三％，若十白可林之試騐，則爲八五，六％，醫科大學生則爲九三，六％之陽性反應。別一方面，如Herman,Baet　Jer,Doull諸氏，在諸大學之檢査爲六〇％，有時僅有三五％之陽性土白可林反應，其間負號反應之學生，在第三學年之終，反應變成陽性。據是以觀，此種數量，殊屬變化莫測。無論如何，此種大規模之檢査，爲早期診斷之最有價値者，而使學生得以早期治療。</p>
<p>成人結核之觀察，則爲職業有莫大之關係，最易受傳染者，如醫生與護士是。在德國瑞典丹麥法國美國諸境，將有關於職業與傳染之研究報吿，其結果甚不一致。如以比利時之看護女學生而論，在工作之始，僅有二四％至三〇％，在學習終了之時，則爲一〇〇％之被傳染者矣。卽在同一之年齡，護士之死亡例，亦較普通一般婦女爲高，故護士與結核之傳染危險實大，又在土白可林反應陽性之女護士，較之反應陰性者息病者較少。以美國之報吿，在女護士學習之期間內，患病者有六至七％。</p>
<p>結核爲護士之職業病乎，此項問題乃Kreuser氏在德國肺病醫師聯合會年會所發表者，氏將近年來各處之報吿，及護士之死亡及疾病統計，加以詳細之研究，以各種之觀察而論，則護士並不較一般職工之婦女傳染例爲高。但無論如何，此種特殊的職業，危險實較其他一般普通職業爲甚，乃無可諱言者也。</p>
<p>關於婦女之統計如何，Hofbauer-Flatzeck氏在柴而査夫倫地方結核紀念日之會議，謂婦女之結核死亡例，自一八九〇年或一九〇〇年起較之男子爲低，大的男子因職業的關係而增惡。在戰時，則男女兩方之統計，幾乎相埒，以後則婦女又較低於男子之死亡例，此種相差之原因，不甚明瞭。但婦女一方有管理家庭之義務，同時每有工作之壓迫，此二重之關係，與結核之發生，輒有莫大之影響，而成爲防癆上之問題。</p>
<p>如上所述，結核死亡例之减少，乃由於防癆之結果。惟在大城市間，結核之傳染統計高峯爲六二％，工業及紡織之勞工爲五一％，其中百分之二十至二十五屬於婦女工人。</p>
<p>英國之統計，在職業之人，而有多量灰塵之吸入者，或鞋匠與縫衣工及窖內之工人等，均有較高之死亡例。以比利時Arnould氏之研究，凡全世界煤鑛工人之結核死亡統計，較之其他同樣之民族爲少。</p>
<p>自一九二一年至一九二三年之死亡例</p>
<p>煤鑛工人年齡自十五至六十五歲一〇，一（每一萬人中）</p>
<p>鄉間工人年齡自十五至六十五歲七，六（每一萬人中）</p>
<p>其他職業者　一三，〇（每一萬人中）</p>
<p>水銀中毒，與結核統計亦極有關係，如一九一七年至一九二六年之意大利水銀鑛工入，每一萬人中之死亡例，爲五十二例，其家屬爲五〇，七例，其餘附近之居民，爲三十一例。因水銀爲一種毒物，引起慢性中毒之瘦損症，致其工人及其子孫易罹結核症。</p>
<p>在南斐洲之有色鑛工，以各種之統計而觀，在最初發時爲急性而嚴重者，但患者若重回其家鄉時，則疾病變成溫和之象。</p>
<p>在意大利北方諸城結核診療所之統計，發現在六十歲以上之年齡，有六％之男性五％之女性之結核患者，且多屬於開放性，在其家屬自爲一大危險，至少之程度，凡幼孩應施以隔離。</p>
<p>德國開放性結核之統計，Brauning氏以結核診療所之每年死亡統計，乘以三倍之數，如一九三二年德國之死亡例，一萬人中爲七，五例，乘以三倍爲二二，五例，若以全國之人口而計，則爲十四萬六千二百五十人。以最近之診療所報吿而觀，在一九三零至一九三一年，每一萬人中有十八，三例之開放性結核，其平均之牛活年齡計算爲二年。以Soellinger氏之研究，則家屬以內之傳染幾及開放性全數三分之一。在此種傳染之源泉，經過四年以上之消滅，其家屬之疾病危險，方始减少云。</p>
<p>與Brauning氏之統計相近者，爲美國Barnes氏，以渠之報吿而論，凡開放性結核之平均生存年齡爲三六，七二個月。</p>
<p>以俄國之診療所統計，結核患者之生存年齡，爲一年半至二年。此種比較，俄國之情形較之他國爲不良。</p>
<p>又有一問題，至今日尙未能解决。凡潛伏性之結核，在某種入體之內，因何種原因而始爆發，爲初期病灶之重新爆發乎，抑爲過度傳染Superinfektion乎，或爲二種之合併原因乎。此種研究，在疾病之傳染上而論，有極大之關係。在二百八十對之夫婦間，每對之中均有一人因結核而死亡。但每對中之另一方面，僅有六，六％九傳染有結核症，五，五％之死亡例。又以Sale氏之研究，在一千一百對夫婦之統計，爲一零，五四％之傳染病例，五，五四％之死亡例。Arnould氏爲一零％，Opie氏爲十二，六五％。Minnig氏爲十六，八％。Simon氏爲十八，八％之死亡例，及二二，四％之傳染例。又以Kellner氏之證明，凡結婚之開放性結核患者，僅有三％或一，七三％傳染及於對方。此項疾病統計數量，若以全數居民之疾病統計而論，已經甚高，的有十倍於普通者矣。又堪注意者，爲男子之患者，多傳染及於健康之妻子。反是則爲例甚鮮，其原因爲婦女多有姙娠及生產之關係，或因看護病者，遂致傳染例增加。</p>

<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>忍冬科Caprifoliaceae</p>
<p>一忍冬Lonicera　japouica，Thunb．</p>
<p>（植物）自生於山野路傍，蔓性藤本，全株密生褐色之軟毛。葉對生，柄短，作長橢圓形，鈍頭。初夏時，自藤腋間抽出長漏斗狀深唇形花，初開爲白色，後則變成黃色。漿果作小球形，色黑卽熟。</p>
<p>忍冬之葉爲常綠性，經冬不枯，故名。其花可吸得蜜汁，爲兒童所喜愛。又以其花黃白相間，故又名金銀花。</p>
<p>（生藥）忍冬Herba　Lonicerae係採集其莖葉而乾燥之者。市販品槪截成長2－3公分之短片發售，葉多者爲良品。</p>
<p>金銀花Flos　Lonicerae則爲採集其花冠乾燥之而成。本品爲淡黃色或黃褐色之長漏斗狀之唇形花，長約1.5－2.0公分，上唇4裂，雄蕊5個，着生於花喉。又有混入花蕾者，花蕾作棍棒狀，密生褐色之細毛，味有收歛性。</p>
<p>（成分）忍冬之主要成分爲單寗質，大的爲8％。其一般之分析如次：</p>
<p>含窒素物I8％　單寗質　8.06　　灰分7.66％　乾燥物質可溶成分43％　水分　7.8％</p>
<p>（藥用）舊說：忍冬有利尿之效。金銀花亦同。又製爲「忍冬酒」，可作腫瘍洗滌之用。</p>
<p>處方例：煎金銀花，作腫瘍洗滌藥用。</p>
<p>金銀花，苦參，山椒，各一五·〇</p>

<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>鼻淚管是淚液由小淚管送入淚囊而排泄於鼻腔的必經道路。我已於本刋上一期中，詳細圖示說明。但是這個鼻淚管有時可以發生狹窄或閉塞。以致引起種種症候。發生狹窄或閉塞的原因。一般所知的，有四。卽</p>
<p>鼻腔疾—鼻腔疾患中，最易引起鼻淚管狹窄及閉塞的。就是鼻茸腫及甲介肥厚症。因爲直接可以壓迫鼻淚管。使之狹窄。甚者竟可閉塞。</p>
<p>眼病—譬如在眼臉結膜患有沙眼的時候。炎症常可波及鼻淚管的粘膜。管腔因之肥厚。分泌亦卽漸决增加。結果致使鼻淚管發生狹窄或閉塞。</p>
<p>周圍骨膜炎—亦可引起鼻淚管的狹窄或閉塞。</p>
<p>外傷—同上</p>
<p>鼻淚管狹窄及閉塞的症候。就是患者發生流淚症。淚液不能由鼻淚管向下流通。以致滯積於淚囊。此時若用手指壓迫淚囊部。則淚液可由小淚點逆流於眼內。這種病狀，稱曰淚囊無力症。有時淚囊漸次擴張。形如囊腫。隆起於皮膚表面。觸之感有波動。這種病狀，稱曰淚囊水腫。</p>
<p>鼻淚管狹窄及閉塞最妥的治療方法。就是用淚管探子。先由淚點揷入。再經小淚管及淚囊。而達鼻淚管。探子須先用小號。待鼻淚管漸次擴大後。再行改用大號。若用此法不克奏效。則可摘出淚腺。若已成爲淚囊水腫。則可施行淚囊摘出術。同時尙須注意本病的原因。若由鼻腔疾患而起者。更宜先治爲要。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（九一）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>關於殺滅結核菌之方法，已見於上面所述。此外，本病患者在療養時，爲欲消滅痰中及病室內之結核菌，幷防禦結核菌飛散之危險起見，有許多事情，狠値得整重注意的；此種種有似瑣碎逾分，其實是得失狠大，每個人都應該頭頭是道，而一致遵行的。此中的細則，我現在且節抄於下面：</p>
<p>痰須吐入痰壺，痰壺中放以石炭酸水；勿令痰乾燥。此痰壺中之痰最好棄於便所內。</p>
<p>凡不及吐於痰壺中之痰，則吐於紙片或手帕內；咳時須用以掩口。此用過之紙片或手帕，可收集於一定之紙箱焚毀之。</p>
<p>患者所用之食器類，與他入所用者，不可在同處管理。每回先冲以沸水，再洗滌之；能投入鍋中煮沸消毒則尤妥。</p>
<p>病室或鄰室，須備兩個面盆，一散以水，一盛以尋常消毒滅菌劑溶液。患者於每次食前須洗滌手指一决。看護人在取携痰壺或其他汚物後，必須洗手一次；卽不曾取物，而但離開病室時，亦同。手之消毒最初用肥皂與水，次以溶液，方爲完全。</p>
<p>雜用器物時以石炭酸水拭之。病室之掃除，不可以箒揚塵（結核菌飛散之危險），須以水拭；地板上能以石炭酸水拭之則更佳。</p>
<p>無用之書籍，手帕，襯衣，及價値低廉之物品；最好焚毀之。其須再用之手帕，襯衣，被單等伴，用後卽投於一定之大釜中，收集後煮沸十分鐘，方洗滌之。</p>
<p>凡用上法消毒困難之物，例如書籍，皮箱，木器，等；可用日光曝射數日。</p>
<p>病室內須儘量使日光射入。</p>
<p>患者移居後，如欲將全室消毒，可用福爾買林噴霧消毒法。</p>
<p>患者居住之室，大致逾半年後，對於後住者卽可無危險。其經過嚴密消毒手續者，則祗須一二月期即可用。（以上十則，大致據日本原榮所著肺病豫防療養敎則。）</p>
<p>關於患者咯痰之處置法以及住處家具用物之種種嚴密消毒手續，大致已如上所述。此外，患者之糞便，也應該像處置咯痰之方法消毒的，允以兼有腸結核腎臟結核之合併症者爲最不可忽視！</p>

<h3>霉雨期之衛生</h3>
<p>— 郭人驥</p>
<p>入霉雨期。空氣中之濕度增加。氣溫亦升高。恰爲黴菌之發育最佳之機會。蓋各種菌類飛散於空中。室內器具衣類等。無不附着。此等菌類。苟無一定之溫度濕氣以及發育所必需之營養分。則不能繁殖。自冬至春。以寒冷乾燥之故而成萎縮。一至霉雨期。驟然得勢。卽起繁殖而跳梁跋扈矣。其中爲吾人所得目睹者。爲黴。是卽存在於空氣中之絲狀菌。附着繁殖而爲人目所得見者。厥爲其所集合之團體耳（集落）微菌之養分。與人類相同。需要蛋白質含水炭素脂肪唯太命鹽類等。雖至微量。亦已足用。故凡有極少的養分，附着於衣服器具之上。卽得發育繁殖其無數之菌類者也。</p>
<p>人類與細菌之食物。旣已相同。而在此季。雖極少量之養分。猶得發育其多數之菌類。當此時也。吾人日常飲食物之上。亦見各種徽菌發育旺盛。是爲當然之理。其與飲食物一幷由口侵入之傳染病。亦在霉雨期中流行。固非毫無理由者也。</p>
<p>此種富於危險性之病原菌。雖屬同類。然與上述完全無害之黴菌不同。蓋其構成之團體（集落）。並不能爲人目所見。因而處置更爲不易者也。又吾人之飲食物。若有種種菌類發育之時。菌之自身。固尙無直接危害人體之事。然在其發育之時。飲食物必被共所分解。例如含水炭素之類（穀類糖類食品）。則起醱酵。蛋白質（肉類蛋類牛乳等品）則起腐敗。其已腐敗醱酵之分解物。爲人體所攝取。則人體多受其害。吾人習知因食物致病之事。（西名拍套猛中毒）以霉雨期爲最多。卽其例也。</p>
<p>在霉雨期。氣溫濕度等。不僅適宜於菌之發育。此時又恰當可恐的蠅類之發生期。此等蠅類。恒自黴菌之所在地。搬運其菌以至吾人飲食物之上。不待言也。在今日狀况之下。衛生設施。尙不備具。糞尿塵埃之處置。尙不完全。是故蠅之發生。實亦當然之現象。邇來大衆雖已略知注意。然究難達到絕滅之域者也。</p>

<p>棉市始漲繼疲、結果尚堅、蓋以邇來現棉消費良好、日廠購辦尤勤、人心帶挺、陳棉高價又至四十四元、午後以紗市轉挫、棉市受其牽制、</p>
<p>標花又到四十四元</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉南方套出而跌一至六磅音、印棉跌〇·七五至一羅比、大阪三品花跌一·二角、市場人心平常、詎二盤開拍、買風尤熾、檯面緊俏、各月狂跳三四角、三收盤平平、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲三角半五角半、午後開盤承上午之餘氣續挺、近六七兩個均至四十四元、繼以多頭出檔、二三盤轉向下落、結果各月比上午收盤價跌一角至二角半、惟本月勿動、查賣出裕大三千一百擔、大豐二千九百擔、合興四千三百担、賡豐三千三百擔、愼記五千五百擔泰昌三千三百擔、信誠四千三百擔、瑞源一千六百擔、潤康三千擔、益康一千擔、新昶一千一百擔、買進恒昌二千一百擔、裕豐四千一百擔、明德二千擔、長餘三千一百擔、益昶二千八百擔、長和二千三百擔、仁豐二千三百擔、同和一千一百担、同豐一千一百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布銷塲尚堪維持</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市況、因中美貨幣協定問題、經當局切實表明後、人心漸歸安定、紗花上落甚微、市場缺乏刺激消息、市盤呆定、銷路僅堪維持、以汕頭爲較佳、昨續辦條紊麻紗·府綢·細布·洋紗·印花布疋一百餘件、四川帮大批運去色布、昨續有添購、成交五虎牌摩登藍布、價七元七角、東方大港牌·至聖牌·灰斜·價七元六角半、元斜·秋香斜·價七元九角半、明鏡藍布價九元二角、等貨五十餘箱、北路烟台帮續採大生廠十六磅三星粗布五十包、怡和廠十三磅九天粗布·十一磅三貓布二十餘包、本街進東貨十磅跳舞市布百餘包、現貨軋缺、加價五分、多數係用作洋紗漂布之坯布、色貨盤平平、獨東貨四君子嗶嘰·直貢·行盤提高略見緊俏云、</p>

<h3>糧食　現粉喊價轉低　標準近期欲漲無力</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、一致呈良好之象、以洋麥報價、上落無幾、惟因貨幣問題、多空推考不同、就過去情形、未免利於多頭、故開價曾軟、後則逐步高昂、六月份收價至三元另八分、遠期則大致漲三分不等、迫至下午開盤、形勢略變、六月份雖爲新陳交接、不過近來現銷甚寂、目下頗是供多於求之勢、如現粉喊價、已低至三元二角半、較前日已落一角、是以六月份人心、驟然平軟、結果反較小七厘半、至遠期各月份、因業外仍有拉進、勢仍議定、觀後來情形、恐以現銷之寂寞、市面將自然就下云、</p>
<h3>雨水過多期崠步漲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平穩之態、以洋麥上落甚微、但天時不能暢晴、不免有雨水太多之感、各月份交易難未暢旺、價則提高三五分不等、迨至下午開肋、初開人心又好、較上午再提三四分、後以空戶加碼、並傳現粉去化甚寂、致人心又虛、較初開回落二三分、現麥市面、因廠需平常、粉銷不振、故喊價又落二分、開山東瑤灣宿州徐州麥四元六角一分、計二千八百包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、市面大體上爲五月期支所配、該期在本月二十六日到期、價格恐無大漲之望、</p>
<h3>新菜籽已有拋開</h3>
<p>新菜籽雖未登場、但例年東洋在三四月份已開始做訂期貨交易、此種訂期成交數、每年總額須在十幾萬包、今庚因天時不常、陰雨連綿、致年成大受影響、故其市價自開七元四角半漲至八元四角後、成交數至上週末祗有五萬包左右、且經營斯業及販運客戶尚不敢拋、昨聞星期日、曾成交二千包、蕪湖貨價爲八元四角半、行情再漲五分、仍訂六七八月份交易云、</p>
<h3>薄稻動銷市價回好</h3>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源念一二號、市上各貨去路因天時陰雨、店方上市不多、致去路清淡、市價白粳又小六七角、薄稻價小數　至　角、羊杜尖亦小五六分、陰變元價小近角、埠秈價小角許、其餘各貨價均見下游之勢、</p>
<h3>客秈貶值後去路稍活</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭續有長江及浙東運到、到數雖、然申地存底不足、行囤米售心熱、市面續居平軟步落之象、昨日天氣陰雨而炎熱、行囤貨主均以存米不能久擱、多主貶值脫手、故各米續小三五分、價小後消化靈活、市面反居穩定、全日聞出贛米四千五百五十包、溫台米九百二十五包、除客秈少數點綴外、盡出本街辦去云、</p>
<h3>油市蔴油湧到突然暴落</h3>
<p>蔴油市自上月由香港帮動辦、行情提高至二十九元後、究因價位極頂、各路來源因之激增、前後到貨不下一萬餘廳、是以人心疲軟、故上月下旬南宿州油市即向挫至二十八元五角、蚌埠油復又跌至二十八元、共成交一千三四百廳之譜、自本月以來、原料步見鬆動、兼之生豆油均告下跌、致人心更形不振、買賣雙方已擯待半月之久、始終前日懷遠貨跌開二十六元三角、較前意跌一元七角之鉅、成交二百擔、計七百餘廳、由本街零星辦去、暫因銷路有限、市見平定之象</p>

<p>合組公司昨屆標兌之　、　　糧白等總定額爲五千二百六十一包、標價無更動、結果成交五羊粗白順德廠出品七百十五包、二十一元八角、曲溪廠出品三十包、二十一元六角、市新廠中砂白五十包、十九元八角、四號綿白九十包、二十元六角、二號綿白二十元八角、未有成交、</p>

<p>四月份上海糖品進口統計（單位：公擔）</p>
<h3>北貨　龍口粉開盤跌一元</h3>
<p>龍口　粉乾、近以銷路稀少、故到存雖缺、因現非銷令、市勢突疲、昨聞客貨開出百餘包、價爲二十三元、比之前盤小去一元、行盤（九二皮）叫售二十三元半、次之二十三元、亦有隨鬆之勢、後市因去胃不暢關係、暫難回振、</p>
<h3>汕橘餅頗感缺貨</h3>
<p>橘餅邇來到存均稀、但以走場不多、如廈門溫州等貨均疲軟不振、如廈軟餅號方零星開出、比前又小五角、溫州餅以去胃少動、續見下游、行售普通僅十九元、較高者呌二十元、惟汕頭餅前到有限、業已告罄、據產區函訊、因出貨亦缺、辦價反緊、故後批即有到來、亦有看升之象、</p>
<h3>海味　海蟄頭皮存貨不多</h3>
<p>海蟄、即爲水母、無緒無骨、浮沉水中、隨潮流往來、發育極速、產於浙省岱山·羊山·衢山·泗礁·黃龍·六橫·溫州·曁魯省烟台等處、每值六月出新、迨至九月爲止、產額豐盛、銷塲亦廣、如江浙閩粵川鄂湘贛均有巨量銷化、貨推羊山岱山爲佳、溫州烟台較次、現下各路生意、尚未發動、街上存貨、亦不豐厚、故市在兩擯之間、行盤兜售、羊山蟄皮原件價九元、改纂九元二角、泗礁貨八元六角、別檔斷貨無市、蟄頭三年陳貨、售價七元五角、二年陳六元五角、隔年陳五元六角、</p>

<h3>庸醫與國聯</h3>
<p>— 承緒</p>
<p>一個人得了病，便要延請一位有名的醫生加以療治：待經診察的結果，認爲非常險惡，照理講起來，那位醫生旣然認清這病源的所在　　且也知道如要速起沉疴，非得施用迅速撲減的重量藥劑不可。但是那醫生却鑒於病人的病勢雖重，而病終是審在那病人身上，更恐怕妨碍了本身的名醫隆譽，於是乎就開了一帖無關痛癢的太平湯頭給那病人服下。但病勢竟一天沉重似一天。終於鳴呼哀哉，回到來的路上去。以上的情形，就呌做「庸醫殺人。」</p>
<p>因爲庸醫能够殺人，而聯想到這次竟阿的戰事。阿國自得了意國侵略病症之後，便去請求那位國聯大醫生去診治。但是國聯大醫生明知這阿國病勢的來頭，是非常的沉重而且是非常的危險，必須以一種重量的藥劑加諸意國。但終以阿國得病畢竟竟是害在阿人身上，恐怕損及國聯大醫生本身的威信，乃於無可如何之中，施用了一帖等於仙方式一類的制裁藥劑，在大醫生眼光看去，覺得這一劑妙藥，施用得非常得意。但在意國方面看來，仍然無關痛癢，而病入膏肓的阿國，只見一天沉重似一天，結果是輾轉床褥，茍延了七個月又十四天，終於國祚替減，一個活鮮的阿比西尼亞獨立國家，畢竟是併入意國版圖了，以上的一切，就呌做「國際聯盟。」</p>
<p>我國五年以前，不是曾經得了一次「九一八」的重症，而也曾請過那位國聯大醫生嗎？直到現在病勢究竟如何，可憐只有自己曉得。</p>
<h3>五月之花</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>五月之花，說起了，這詞，是多麼地够使人興奮呀？是花，是五月之花，是這初夏的五月之花，是那麼地含有强烈的刺激性！</p>
<p>玫瑰是那麼的美麗，而且還含有醇厚的香味。但是香豔的玫瑰，却是有刺的，這便是有强烈的刺激性的五月之花。但是玫瑰，是五月之花，草莓，也是五月之花。草莓花兒，也是那麼的豔麗，同時，沒有扎手的刺兒。但是也沒有香味。沒有刺，沒有香味，這便是草莓花，沒有玫瑰花那麼的富有刺激性，雖然玫瑰花，草莓花，同是五月之花。</p>
<p>老友徐君，不見者已有四年了，上個月裏，忽自古都北平來，精神頹喪。我問起了他的近况，他忽然熱淚直流說：「老友，我給五朋之花，刺痛了我的一顆心兒了。」</p>
<p>原來他在這四年中，流浪在故都，生活是潦倒得甚麼似的。但在潦倒的物質生活中，他的精神上，却有一種很有意味的滋養，那是一個和他生活同樣潦倒的姑娘，因處境的相同，竟是茁長着愛苗兒來了。</p>
<p>那姑娘的父親，是智識威着飢荒的，他見女兒，長得似五月裏的玫瑰那麼的豔麗，他早已想把自己下半世的生活，靠着這個玫瑰兒的了。因此他對於我那朋友，和他女兒的孕育着的戀愛之花，肆力地摧殘着。</p>
<p>五月裏的暴風雨，終於把五月之花征服了。老頭兒把庭前的那株玫瑰，移植到了後圃去，我朋友所得的報酬，便是一紙「限於嚴命，……後會無期」的絕交書，裏面更附着三年來，我那朋友寫去的一百張的玫瑰色信紙。</p>
<p>我那朋友，受了這一次極大的創傷，他說：「從此我不再希望有玫瑰花了，我想永久的與草莓花爲友，永久的沉醉在沒有刺的，也沒有刺激性的草莓花裏了。我的心，已一度受了嚴重的創傷了，這創傷，是永久沒有恢復的希望的了！」</p>
<p>天哪，「五月之花」，有刺激性的，會傷人，不傷人的，沒有刺激性，我的朋友，已深切地體味出來了。</p>
<h3>嬝娜春風譜竹枝</h3>
<p>— 阿萬</p>
<p>竹枝乃樂府之名，本出巴渝，如吳　有和聲，即揚竹枝取拍，而後女兒聯唱是也。唐元和中，劉禹錫附王叔文，坐貶朗州司馬，更倡新詞十餘篇，武陵夷俚悉歌之。是后各地盛行，凡以七绝詠土俗瑣事者，皆謂之竹枝詞。</p>
<p>吾友孟遠兄，爲吳江名宿金松岑先生之大郎，隨侍於蘇作寓公，好敲韵語，私淑隨園。當掇吳王臺畔之花絮，吟成竹枝詞，刊諸范君煙橋所編之明晶，譽滿士林。日積月累，得百胡代付梨棄。胡，吳下名律師士楷媛也。行見是編一出，紙貴洛陽，而喜談胥臺風月者，更可手披口誦。余爲題二截云：「姑胥糜鹿幾滄桑，花月餘痕入錦囊；吟得竹枝多少闋，赫　粟尾沁芬芳」。「古調巴渝屬女兒，記從賓客倡新詞；而今茂苑鶯歌起，嬝娜春風譜竹枝」。又集定廠茍得兩絕云：「年來花草冷蘇州，儉腹高譚我用憂；賴是搖鞭吟好句，東南一部小陽秋」。「三生花草艾蘇州，紅是相思綠是愁；別有尊前揮涕語，文人珠玉女兒喉。」然則洋洋大箸，劉賓客弗能專美於前矣。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初溫</p>
<p>太陽是不像人，肯稍微留戀的。當國器在那深巷子裏不斷的出神的時候，天色已經漸現着昏黃，快要天黑了。去這裏不遠，靠了城墻根，有兩所古廟。這時，噹噹的兩三聲鍾響，送到耳朵裏來。隨了這鍾聲，自己抬起頭來看看，只見兩三隻烏鴉，扇着翅膀，由天空飛過。心裏忽然想到李平山的約會，這可太大意了，立刻拔步就向李家走了去。所幸路尚不多，不過十分鍾就到了。遠遠的就看到平山背了兩手，在大門口巷子裏來回走着。現見到之後，立刻跑上前，握住了他的手，笑道：你向來不失信的人，爲什麼今天這樣姍姍來遲。國器笑道：真對不住。在出學校門的時候，就想到立刻向這裏走來，不走料到半路途中，就發生了……說着，伸手摸了兩摸臉，現出躊躇的樣子。平山道：這準是在半路上遇到了朋友，拉到茶館子喝茶去了。國器搖搖頭笑道：我沒有這種習慣。說時，隨着平山走到他家裏去。平山也收拾了一個小小的書房，將桌椅都搬得齊整，書桌上的花瓶子裏，插好了一束新鮮的月季花，那宜興陶泥茶具，也洗刷得沒有一點污穢的痕跡。在花瓶子旁邊，一部帶函的精裝詩韻，上面壓了白石細摩的鎮紙。青彩細瓷的大碗裏，浸着許多五花石，那水也清得一點灰紋沒有。國器週圍打量了一番，笑道：看你這樣子，倒是有心在家裏烹茶候客。平山道：自然啦。你看，天上都該露出星斗來了，我還等着你一路到北極閣去賞月不成？我想起來，你必是讓同事的，拉去下棋了。國器在書桌邊一張椅子上坐了，隨手在書架上抽過一本書來翻着，笑道：反正我有點事情躭誤就是了。你又何必問。平山笑道：若是如此，我倒更要問，吾兄其有豔遇乎？國器並不答復他，只是去翻書。平山笑道：哦！這是我說話擬不於倫，吾兄是一位老實書生，何至於此？不過這話又說回來了。我今天在春花雜誌上，看到你作的一篇喜相逢短篇小說，描寫得實在好，我疑心你真有這樣一個境遇。國器樂道：我沒有做這樣一篇文字。平山道：你署名不是話楓兩個字嗎？（二三）</p>

<h3>西湖隱者</h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>曩害錢塘，吏事清閑，　山不禁，日涉成趣。旣　，因更訪是邦之隱於僧及伏其身者，與話　粟漱泉之樂。西楚時富　　　平　　，方亦浮沉同僚，　於孤僻，益相導遊。重平從曲　　先生游，壯復受經於夏靈岑，一　淵源，友生遊湖上，合轍按搜，於是逃禪　世之土，更因而識其六七。然猶未知南屏隱者汪千伋爲何若人也？余募千伋，始終壬申。時僧淨雨住持虎跑，深秋招飲，洪醉遂旦，曉風吹歸，乾枯裂舌，過蒼水祠，見道左有寬　者，遽入乞茗，三面湖窗，一階風五影，有殘荷作迎，幽萬爲司呼喚，主人係頒白婦，殷勤肅客，吐詞斐然，意即石戶偕隱之流？叩之，果然。自謂：汪姓，驅犢桂林，息比垂五戰矣。問不慮日資之不給乎？則曰：鳥獸之毛可績，其遺粒烏得而飽？吾夫不薄韓康，竊師其業矣。問可得見歟？曰：入山猶未歸也。　　人　，惘然久之！　巡虛齊，清　流　，奮籍　笺而外，僅紅梅一幅，朗照　　。近廉，一稚雙方伏案凝神，平視了不驚避，　詩成未及半也·念若女若母，品清如此，彼剿　老人，又當何若？一瓢因緣，苦業竊寐，然飲訪而卒不果者，俄四戰·客臘將有事南昌，取道武林，肅箋先告，乞遲我於南屏落照間；及期　車，與夢蕉偕，馱肥雪，叩幽局，白髪蒼　，握手如素。導登聽鍾樓頭，茗話如抽　　弗能息。詰以鳥獸不可與同羣，先生胡樂而居此？則謂然曰：吾少舉於鄉，壯涉重洋，鎮研西學，亦當窺其大略，在當時未始不欲出其所學，見諸行述：顧仕未必需學，而學亦未必臺洽乎政，日月不待，老將奚連？易有之「　而未見，行簡未成，」當今之量，何摹乎沮　之徒，聊以懺吾之終莫成爾；且　售獲資活，固未嘗塊然外於世也。先生行年六十有三，聲洪若壯夫，問何修　？曰：得力於持經，心不外馳，則精氣內飲，故內典一以貫之，導人以　耳。其釋尼陀羅經有云：佛言即人言，奇之則惑。皆發人所未到。時　風益厲，囂勢愈戰，　望潤心　影，被玉　科拖，在空漢有無之間；顧室內　火熊熊，轉覺奇溫，間及詩事，先生稱少年結習都泯，獨老妻　雲，（王氏）與吾女振芬，猶樂爲之。出其女公子吟集：有「山中采藥亦醫國，何必希榮到鼎鍾？」「除將好靜無他事，一卷金經七碗茶。」「聲喧門外無車馬，人比潯陽五柳居。」等句。一門風雅，庶幾兼之。先生字千伋，別號輕安居士，論其生平，讀李傳元聯，可知槪末。跋云：「辛丑，余典試粵西，歸經武昌，張文襄以得人賀，首舉千伋，謂爲經世才：然千伋澹於仕進，游泰西歸，遂隱於醫。」易贊肥　先悶者，微斯人而誰與？</p>
<h3>爲天廬題畫</h3>
<p>— 胡懷琛</p>
<p>竹荘老人上官周。云是清初之逸民。一子好書不肯作偶然落筆如有神。此幅疑是自寫照，一足赤裸頭無巾。仰面穩坐手把卷，眼中豈有漢魏人！俗人見之不甚愛，遂使墨寶久湮淪。今日忽爲天　得，遇合亦是有宿因。願嬌珍重慎防護，或恐畫中老人化爲神仙上天去。</p>
<p>（註）作畫者自署欵。</p>
<h3>盤龍筍</h3>
<p>— 顏蔭泉</p>
<p>和煦的春風，一陳陳，一陳陳，把埋藏在地層內的筍，一枝枝吹得它們露出了頭來！</p>
<p>因此，我又想起了去年吃盤龍筍的故事。筍，雖然是自然的產物，不過這種盤龍筍，却是全由人工造成的。所以我們不妨呼它爲「人造盤龍筍」呢！</p>
<p>這種筍的造法，雖然是極度平常的，不過若非親自到產筍區內親戚家裏，大有雖千金不能求得之槪！</p>
<p>至於它的造法是：把上枝剛透同地面的筍，用一隻泥　把它罩住，然後再用那數十斤的石塊，把泥　緊緊的壓住，任它在裏面緩緩的生長起來，終於，那枝筍就彎彎曲曲生長在　裏啦！</p>
<p>吃的時候，衹須將　翻倒挖出，隨便怎樣煮法都可以，質嫩味無窮！不過鄉民迷信「罪過」兩字，每年山主所造不過二三枝，所以他們是不願輕易把它　客的。</p>

<h3>舞校攬勝</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>跟着朋友走進黑漆漆的衡堂，轉灣抹角，正懷疑「莫非我被引進地獄？」的時候，驀地裏朋友掉過頭來說；「到了，到了。」</p>
<p>那是一座破舊的小洋房，在斑爛的白漆玻瑙門前，豎着一塊木牌，黏貼着紅紙寫的廣告：「今晚舉行舞藝大會，練習券每元十二張，奉送香茗，××舞校白。」在庭院的角落，用馬口鐵遮搭着，朋友問：「要小溲嗎？」我搖搖頭。</p>
<p>於是帶着糢糊的神志走進屋子，一位蓄長髪，穿藏青西裝的先生招待我們在半邊帆椅上坐了，面前有一隻茶几，又有一位戴老光眼鏡，穿鼻煙色長衫的先生送過兩杯茶來，居然還有一塊小錢似的「衣帽牌」。不規則的亞拉伯字「三五」，我驚奇着追麼小的地方有這許多人。</p>
<p>四壁繃着藍色的布帷，每支角落亮着油綠色的燈光，鬼眼似的，充溢著迷惑感，長方形的光滑的地板四週，坐着女人，女人，女人……每張女人的臉是無光澤的白色礦石粉捏成似的，襯托在幽黯的綠色光裏，沒有腮脂的部位便形成了死灰。這裏有穿綫呢袍子的商店夥計，這裏有穿馬褂的假紳士，西裝少年和不扣領鈕的女人，一些劣質的香水氣，一些刺激的煙草味，一些粗野的話語和調笑。蕩魂的曲子打放聲器裏播送出來，衝着十幾對正如幽靈般旋舞着的男女。這裏永遠沒有白畫，永遠沒有清醒的神經……</p>
<p>「儘舞呵，樂個暢快呵，一塊錢不是有十二次嗎！」這話語是打隔座傳過來的，我眼見那些女人憊疲地伏在男子肩頭上了，眼皮圓着，身體被緊摟，推動着。這是生活哪，污泥般的。「莫非我已被引進地獄？」我疑視着我的朋友。</p>

<h3>津舉辦敬老會</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>昨據報載，天津第三通俗圖書館，十七日舉辦敬老會，到男女老人八十二名，來賓到一百餘人，六三老人葉桂林表演唱歌，八三老人房金榮，表演拳術云云。査近來敬老會的發起，各處多有，如山西，四川，廣東，等處，都有過這樣一套把戲，現在的時候，其可謂老運亨通了。</p>
<p>老人確眞可敬，因爲這些老人，多由少壯而來，尋常的入，還活不到四五十歲，他們居然活到七八十歲，或竟至百餘歲，此種長壽的福氣，確是不小，然長壽的可敬，必須伴以　　條件，　長壽必須以健康爲貴，若長壽而不健康，眞似活死人而已。　長壽者於共少壯時，必須曾經幹過一番偉大事業者爲貴，若毫無建樹，庸碌一世，亦是飯桶而已，有何可貴，　長壽尤必須以多福爲貴，倘長壽而衣食不周，困窮潦倒，則長壽不若短壽之爲愈，猶如滿淸時，有許多老者，手拿竹杖，身穿黃褂，沿門托缽，乞食求生，此皆曾經國家敬過的老人也。</p>
<p>故敬老不若養老，做現在的人，莫說老和小，不能生存，卽使少壯之人，無職粉可謀，無生活可籍，往往實行消極政策，以圖一死自了者，可說天天都有，若年老之人，而不能維持生活，其困苦自當十倍於此，因年老之人，筋力已衰，精神已頹，更無職業之可圖也，故為政者，旣知老之可敬，不若設法去養老，如建設養老院之類，使老而無告者，或貧窮而無法生存者，均收養於其中，如此比較敬老之會，稍有意義，否則號召許多老人，呌他們唱唱歌，打打拳，如同兒戲，這是弄老了，而非敬老矣。</p>
<p>並且我國的老人，其所以能老之故，問問他們，眞是莫名其妙，並非眞能懂「長生不老」之術，而得黃耈壽考者也，我嘗問過幾位老人矣，有說我少飮食，惟常靜而不敢勸，有說我每食可盡一蹄每日能行三十里，則多食與少食，多動與少動，亦看生理上的需要，並非一味少食多動所能長壽也。</p>
<p>惟有一事我足以風者，現在的世界，幾成父不父，子不子，兄不兄，弟不弟的世界，莫說別家的老人，不在少年的眼中，卽使自己的父母，亦如客人一般，陌路一般者，所在多有，此種情形，或說現在的世界，應該如此，或說無論如何，養育的恩，不可忘記，以上兩說，我雖不敢加以批判，但是我對於前一說，總覺有些不自然，有些異樣，不知一般靑年人看來到底如何？</p>
<p>語曰，「老我老，以及人之老，」現在敬老會之意義，可借此以反其說，曰，「老人老以及我之老」其效騐僅如斯而已。</p>
<h3>國門</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>黃昏時候，潮來了。站在甲板上眺望着太平山頂那璀璨的明燈，歸國的夢越發使我沉醉了。</p>
<p>天漸漸陰沉起來，嘈雜的人聲也似乎疲弱下去。隨着汽笛的長嘯，船緩緩移動了。碼頭方形的棧房同它背後那些高聳的建築，海面上那金蛟鑽動樣的倒影，那龐雜的人聲，一切的一切，全都漸漸遠着，遠着了。從淚眼中望去，香港像披上一層輕沙，又似乎落在灰色的暮霧裏。</p>
<p>船出了鯉魚門，眼前是藍的海，藍的天，每天連成了一綫。我呆呆地站在甲板上，夏初的海風搜索了我身上的熱氣。在船下面是瘋狂的浪，它似在嗚咽，又似在咆哮，一個浪頭拋過來，衝着船身，便粉碎了，化成無數的白沫，刻拋在船的後面。這景象，這雄聲，在我實在太熟識了。半個月來，自從由新加坡動身的那一天起，我便無時不頃聽着這迫似同情於旅人的哀訴，一邊熱情地作着祖國的夢。現在海程行將結束了，明天，，就是這期待了好幾年的明天，我就要投在祖國的懷抱裏了。</p>
<p>船上的人在起椗後大都入睡了，甲板上冷淸淸，只剩下一對澄海人的老夫婦同一個小女孩。他們默無一言，茫然地望着高高的天，茫茫的海——天海在暮靄里溶成一片了——突然，那個小女孩低聲說了：</p>
<p>「娘，明天就到唐山麼？三叔會不會來接我們？」</p>
<p>她的娘點了點頭，默然無語。她望了遠遠的那方，在那兒，一輪月兒剛溜出雲朵，銀光瀉在海面上。</p>
<p>「娘，娘，唐山有「波列」（卽警察）麽？査不査船？」小孩又問了。</p>
<p>「乖，好好睡吧，明天就到唐山了。唐山沒有「波列」的。」</p>
<p>「從異邦回來的人，是怎樣地熱愛着他們的唐山，他們的祖國呵！」我這樣想。現在，我覺得年紀分外的靑，胸中正開着五月的花，連呼吸也自由了。高貴的異邦人的怒眼同叱咤，那有力而蠻橫的拳脚，那奴隸的鎖鍊同鋼鐵的法律，現在正像那水沫一樣，無力地流着流着，遠了遠了。</p>
<p>「我們是有着祖國的呵」！回到艙裏，連作夢也是祖國的，而且我也感到驕傲。</p>
<p>隔天淸早，剛起身，從風窗望過去，外面已不是茫無涯際的大海，船沿着寬大的河道平靜地駛去。水是渾濁的，小浪像黃色的手抹着船身，低低地同我們耳語着，似在說「回來了呵，親愛的兄弟們。」我感到非常的興奮，一氣跑到甲板上，兩岸是低矮的堤，上面滿是荔枝同龍眼樹的林，樹林是這樣濃密，只能够從間隙裏望着那些低矮的茅草屋同趕田去的同胞們。再過去，似乎是廣漠的，有黃色的浪起，伏着的稻田。</p>
<p>「這兒就是虎門」。一個站在我身旁的人這樣吿訴他的同伴。</p>
<p>「呵，虎門！我們南中國的國門的虎門呵！」我低低地私語着。</p>
<p>遠處，在綠葉叢中，似乎有着國旗在飄盪着，但籠上一層淸晨的薄霧，看不淸楚。</p>
<p>現在總算到了唐山了，無時不在懐念中的家鄉立刻就到了，我感到無名的感奮。我趕回艙裏，在收拾我的行李的時候，旁邊的同伴們這樣問我了。</p>
<p>「老表，到省城的時候，有空到我家裏坐坐啊。」</p>
<p>我默默地點了點頭。但另一個念頭却又襲擊了我，親愛的唐山雖然到了，但生活又怎樣去解决呢？</p>
<p>我呆呆地坐在床上，眼眶不覺有點潤濕了。</p>
<h3>弟弟</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>爸爸新買了一個小床回來，白漆的，四面有可以上下的欄杆，上面的鈞子上懸褂着帳子。當天晚上，爸讀完了晚報，抱着小娃兒問：「寳寳歡喜那個小床？」</p>
<p>小娃兒有個挺大的洋囡囡，是舅舅送給他的，媽曾特地編製了一套小絨線衫褲。小娃兒很愛那洋囡囡，他要求爸爸替洋囡囡買一個小床，爸雖然答應了幾决，但總是使小娃兒失望。現在爸問到那個小床，小娃兒在爸懷裏跳了起來，拍着手，學着電影裹那個小明星的樣子，把小嘴凑到爸的耳朶邊說：</p>
<p>「小娃兒喜歡的，小娃兒要洋囡囡睡在那個床裏。」</p>
<p>爸笑着抱住了他的身體，把小娃兒舉過頭頂。一面把小娃兒的話吿訴媽聽</p>
<p>媽坐在臨窗的桌子旁，低着頭替小娃兒縫製夏天的新衣服，聽了爸吿訴的話，笑着放下了手裏的衣服，走到爸跟前，把小娃兒接了過去，親着他的嫩紅的面頰問：「小娃兒喜歡睡那小床？」</p>
<p>「小娃兒要和媽唾，」小娃兒搖搖頭，「洋囡囡睡那個小床。」</p>
<p>「好孩子，」媽說：「小娃兒聽媽話，和洋囡囡一同睡那個小床。」</p>
<p>小娃兒還是搖着頭，「小娃兒怕，老虎，蒼蠅咬小娃兒。」</p>
<p>爸和媽一同笑了起來。</p>
<p>小娃兒常要爸媽講故事。爸講過一個童話：吃飯之前應該先洗手，一個孩子他沒有洗手，把手上遺留着蒼蠅卵吃</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>到肚裏，於是肚子裏生了許多小蒼蠅，把那烟小孩子咬死了。媽講的是一個老虎的故事，某處山裏有一頭老虎，它喜歡吃小孩子，晚上，它常在窗下偸聽，有不肯睡覺的孩子，它就爬進窗來把那孩子搶去。所以小娃兒怕老虎和蒼蠅。</p>
<p>「爸媽在這裏，小娃兒不怕，」媽又親着他的面頰說：「好孩子睡那個小床。」</p>
<p>小娃兒回過頭來看看爸爸。爸爸說</p>
<p>「睡罷。媽要生小弟弟，小娃兒不能和媽一同睡了。」</p>
<p>小娃兒看了看媽微隆的腹部，他似懂非懂地問媽：「媽肚裏有小弟弟？」</p>
<p>媽點着頭，抱小娃兒到新買來的小床上，替他脫了衣服，小娃兒睡穩了，媽才說：「生了弟弟，和小娃兒一同睡好嗎？」</p>
<p>小娃兒高興地回答：「小娃兒要和弟弟一同睡的。」</p>
<p>小娃兒從此常記着媽要生弟弟，他把洋囡囡比做弟弟，抱着它，和它一同睡。又常懐疑地注視着媽的腹部問：「媽肚裏眞有小弟弟嗎？他爲什麽不哭？不要吃餅乾？」爸於是吿訴他：</p>
<p>「小娃兒從前在媽肚裏也是不哭，不吃餅乾，一個孩子在媽肚裏要往十個月才能生下來。媽要到下半年生弟弟，小娃兒喜歡弟弟嗎？」</p>
<p>這樣，小娃兒又時常問詢下半年還有多少時候？</p>
<p>但是夏天剛到來的時候，小娃兒覺得爸媽不像從前那樣地喜歡他了，爸不是早上出去，晚上回來，常常生氣地睡在床上。有時一忽兒出去，一忽兒回來，但是從來沒有帶餅乾回家。小娃兒要爸抱的時候總是討一頓沒趣。媽偸偸地吿訴小娃兒，要他乖乖的一個兒玩，爸沒有生意，爸心裏不高興。</p>
<p>獨自玩着洋囡囡的時候，就想媽快些生弟弟，和弟弟一塊兒玩不是很好的嗎？他常常注意媽微隆的腹部。</p>
<p>一天，媽病了，在床上喊着，呌着，爸抽着烟捲在室內踱來踱去，把痰盂碰翻了也不知道。這一天爸沒有吃飯，小娃兒也餓着肚子坐在屋子的角落裏，他不敢說話，他想起了那些可怕的東西，老虎和蒼蠅。</p>
<p>過了幾天，媽病好了，起床了，但是小娃兒注視到媽腹部的時候，已癟癟地什麼都沒有了。小娃兒看看爸憤怒的臉，他撲到媽懐裏耍媽抱。他覺得這幾天看見了許許多多奇怪的事，都是他所不懂的。他凑着媽的耳朵問：</p>
<p>「媽生了弟弟嗎？」</p>
<p>媽祗是親着他的而頰，沒有回答，媽哭了起來，眼淚流下來掛在小娃兒的面頰上。</p>
<p>那天晚上，媽又和小娃兒一同睡了。爸把那個小床推到在屋子角落裏。</p>
<h3>庚辰婆婆</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>離撇籌山聖母娘娘曾期還有半月，村中就敲鑼了，憑經騐大家就知道鑼聲是爲「催繳會錢」而響的。</p>
<p>到了四月初一，「十家會首」全體出動，拿着戶口册子按門挨戶的收會錢，這是敬神的事，誰也不能不出。前年鞠二成不出會錢，也不上山進香，不是沒出兩烟月就得急病死了嗎？誰不說那是「報應」？</p>
<p>撇　山進香賽會的日子是四月初六，可是初四那天，四鄕各區就有賽會「拉長」（註）了。高矯會，節鞭會，短棍會，耍獅子，旂旛，傘，扇，擺成長長的大陣，從這個村子到那個村子，鑼鼓喧天，歡樂使每個人忘掉了疲勞！</p>
<p>賽會離開村子，娘兒們就忙起來啦，糊元寳，紮會身，剪花紙。小雜貨舖裏積着人，香箔，黃表紙，五色紙都飛　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　滿頭是汗，連抽烟喝水的空兒都抽不出，街門口不斷斷有人來來往往，香紙從門口流出去，錢鈔就從門口流進來；永遠訴說生意賠錢的掌櫃的，此時也不免「諸暗歡喜生意蠻好！」（未完）</p>

<h3>蘇州人（三）</h3>
<p>— 顧文宗作</p>
<p>驚鴻　有用的蘇州男子，難道就免得了你所說的那些弊病嗎？</p>
<p>麗雅　就知職上說；或者這德觀念上說，有用的蘇州男子；總比較沒用的蘇州男子好的多，但是我生平就不喜歡蘇州人，不管他是男人，女人，可憐的老頭子，老婆子，或者是小孩子，友正他祇要是蘇州人，那我對他們紙有惡感沒有好感的</p>
<p>驚鴻　蘇州人跟你有仇恨嗎？</p>
<p>麗雅　不但跟我沒有仇恨，就是跟我家裹的任何人，也是沒有仇恨的，</p>
<p>驚鴻　那你為甚麼這麼恨蘇州人呢？</p>
<p>麗雅　我恨蘇州人的「好吃懶做」！你沒看見蘇州：儘是那些消費的糖食店嗎？你沒見蘇州大街上的水莫點心店嗎？最可惡的就是蘇州人的「好穿戴」，家裏頭的吃飯問題；倒是小事兒，身上頭，那可非得穿得綢光緞滑不可，所以人家都說蘇州人：「身上穿得綢披披，家裏沒有夜飯米」！由於道種議諷的話，照我想起來；總該改變一點兒，蘇州人的壊習慣了，誰知還不能轉變蘇州人的劣根性，所以我就恨透了蘇州人啦！</p>
<p>驚鴻　Miss金，你別太激烈了！過於激烈了，恐怕要得罪人呢！</p>
<p>麗雅　我一生就是北方人的脾氣，想說就說，想幹就幹，至於得罪人的話，那倒是另外一回事兒，反正你不是蘇州人，在你面前批評批評蘇州人，我想决不致於把你得罪了吧？</p>
<p>驚鴻　你知道我是那兒人嗎？</p>
<p>麗雅　你當然是北平人嘍？</p>
<p>驚鴻　我實在不是北平人，</p>
<p>麗雅　你就不是北平人，但也决不會是南邊人，因爲你的體格，臉色，個性，態度，舉動，完全是北方人的樣子。</p>
<p>驚鴻　你實在太直爽了！我們雖然祇在船上；交了不過三天的朋友，可是我早已把你當了一個很久的朋友了，假如我不把你當作老朋友的話，那我從今天起，我就；不再跟你交朋友！</p>

<h3>「黑海洗心記」公映</h3>
<p>「黑海洗心記」叙述一專竊保險之巨賊，曾受徒刑五年，而在獄中勸化學習工業，彼學得一身潛水技術，後因打撈沉船時，聞友人吿知船中保險箱中藏有金幣，乃又復運用其故技，在彼下水探看之時，乘機藏匿，船主知之而不宜揚之，終於良心發現，而將金幣歸還原處，得大學女生之靑眛而結褵，劇情非常深刻而別鏡饒風趣，確是一部罕見之蘇俄名片，全片在海底攝製而成，水中珍奇，琳瑯滿目，該片現在上海大戲院公映。</p>
<h3>高梨痕的新戲</h3>
<p>高梨痕繼「花花草草」後的新戲是什麽呢？據宣傳稿說是「搖錢樹」和「浮雲」。是的，這是洪深爲高梨痕新戲所擬的劇名。可是，現在，洪深却忍痛把道二個劇名放棄了，雖然，大家覺得「搖錢樹」的劇名很好。放棄的原因是因爲宣傳過早，照以往的情形看，如果一個未呈請初審的劇本於事前宜傳，電檢會時在拍竣時令改劇名，到那時，一切宣傳等於白費。際於斯，洪深决另擬劇名，雖已擬定，但未便宣佈。劇本本身巳在寫作中。大概是張振鐸的戲較重，張斐的戲稍輕。內容也係描寫小資格產階級者。至「搖錢樹」劇名，或於半年後再採用。</p>

<h3>National Government's Memorial Week: Chairman Lin Speaks in Mourning for Hu Zhantang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 18th.

After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, they observed three minutes of silence for Mr. Hu Hanmin. Subsequently, Chairman Lin delivered a speech titled "Mourning Mr. Hu Zhantang," which concluded at 10:30 AM. The ceremony then adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of Chairman Lin's speech "Mourning Mr. Zhantang," delivered at the National Government's memorial week on the morning of the 18th, is as follows: "Distinguished colleagues, today is the seventh day since Mr. Zhantang's passing. In these few days, both domestic and international circles have expressed their condolences and regret to the Party and the nation. Coincidentally, twenty years ago today, Mr. Yingshi was killed in Shanghai. At that time, the Party lost a dedicated comrade. Mr. Chen's spirit of bravery and diligent work was invaluable to the Party. His spirit still exists heroically, making our commemorative emotions even more intense. Unfortunately, Mr. Hu has also departed from us, leaving us in eternal grief. It increases our sadness infinitely. When Mr. Hu was recuperating in Guangdong, he intended to come to Nanjing to jointly face the national crisis as soon as his health recovered. Sadly, this wish could not be fulfilled, and he passed away. Even shedding tears in sorrow cannot fully express our grief. We should take Mr. Hu's unfulfilled aspirations as our own. All surviving comrades should continue to struggle. In the past, when Mr. Hu was in Nanjing, he not only continuously fought within the Party but also never slacked in his political responsibilities. Taking the long Legislative Yuan as an example, he never missed a meeting in three or four years. When he resided in Nanjing, he never decided to go elsewhere. This is enough to serve as a good model for us. At the same time, he was an extremely solemn and upright person, sitting upright and dignified, unassailable. Mr. Hu was extremely fond of and promoted young people. If there were any mistakes, he would sternly correct them. Therefore, although Mr. Hu was solemn, his amiable attitude was extremely approachable. In short, Mr. Hu had many virtues, which cannot be fully expressed in one speech. His death is truly a misfortune for the entire Party and the nation. Therefore, the Central Committee specially convened an interim meeting this morning and unanimously resolved to hold a national funeral, and appointed eight members, including Committee Member Ye, to go and offer condolences on behalf of the government and express sympathy to the family. A national funeral preparatory committee will also be established, and a public memorial service will be held on a scheduled date. The National Government has also prepared a funeral oration to be delivered by Committee Member Ye on its behalf. I have also sent a separate condolence letter. These are all appropriate etiquette for commemorating the advanced members of the Party and the nation. Recently, the constitution, the organizational law of the National Assembly, and the election law for representatives of the National Assembly have been announced, preparing for the convening of the National Assembly. At a time when the work is becoming increasingly tense, losing such a mentor makes our responsibilities even heavier. From now on, we should not only mourn but also say that we have exhausted our hearts. I think Mr. Hu, if he is aware in the afterlife, will certainly hope that we continue his aspiration to save the Party and the nation, abide by the Premier's teachings, obey the Three Principles of the People, and strive unremittingly to save the nation and the people. Only in this way can we be worthy of Mr. Hu." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Interfere with Smuggling Suppression in Hebei; Claiming Basis in the Tanggu Agreement is Groundless; The Ceasefire Agreement Absolutely Does Not Involve Central and Local Administrative Anti-Smuggling Activities; Financial Matters Are Not Subject to Any Restrictions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Smuggling in Hebei is becoming increasingly rampant due to the blatant interference of the Japanese side. Chinese customs officials have no way to stop it. According to the Japanese, their various acts of interference with smuggling suppression, such as not allowing customs officers to suppress smuggling on the Great Wall, prohibiting customs officers from carrying pistols, and notifying the Qinhuangdao Customs Office that all anti-smuggling vessels from Lutai to the Qinhuangdao sea area are not allowed to carry machine guns and that anti-smuggling vessels are not allowed to suppress smuggling within three miles of the so-called demilitarized zone, are all based on the Tanggu Agreement. The reporter, considering the importance of this matter and whether the Japanese claims have any basis, specifically visited a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the truth. According to the response, the Tanggu Agreement is essentially a ceasefire agreement, that is, an agreement to end the war at that time. In other words, it is a purely military agreement, with absolutely no political nature, let alone involving financial matters. Customs anti-smuggling is clearly a financial administrative matter and has nothing to do with military affairs. The Tanggu Agreement cannot contain any provisions on this. The agreement was signed and promulgated on May 31, 1933. The full text of the agreement is now attached for research.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Tanggu Agreement</p>
<p>Ceasefire Agreement. On May 25, Showa 8 (1933), Marshal Muto Nobuyoshi, Commander of the Kwantung Army, officially accepted the ceasefire proposal in Miyun with Xu Yanmou, military envoy appointed by He Yingqin, acting chairman of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government. Accordingly, Marshal Muto Nobuyoshi, Commander of the Kwantung Army, entrusted full powers regarding the ceasefire agreement to Major General Okamura Yasuji, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, as the representative of the army. In Tanggu, he concluded the following ceasefire agreement with Lieutenant General Xiong Bin, Chief of General Staff of the Beiping Branch, as the plenipotentiary of the Chinese army in North China appointed by He Yingqin, acting chairman of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government. 1. The Chinese army shall immediately withdraw to the area west and south of the line connecting Yanqing, Changping, Gaoliying, Shunyi, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Bindi Lintingkou, Ninghe, and Lutai, and shall not advance beyond this line thereafter, nor shall it engage in any acts of provocation or disturbance. 2. The Japanese army shall use airplanes and other methods to inspect the implementation of Item 1 at any time. The Chinese side shall provide protection and all kinds of convenience for this. 3. If the Japanese army confirms that the Chinese army has complied with the provisions of Item 1, it will no longer pursue beyond that line and will automatically return to the line of the Great Wall. 4. The maintenance of law and order in the area south of the Great Wall line and north and east of the line shown in Item 1 shall be the responsibility of the Chinese police. The aforementioned police agencies shall not use armed groups that stimulate Japanese sentiment. 5. This agreement shall take effect after being sealed. As proof, both representatives shall sign and seal. Representative of the Kwantung Army: Okamura Yasuji (seal). Representative of the Chinese Army in North China: Xiong Bin (seal).</p>
<p>Memorandum. In the event that armed groups that hinder public order occur in the areas where troops are withdrawn, and they cannot be suppressed by police force, both parties shall handle the matter after consultation. May 31, Showa 8 (1933). Representative of the Kwantung Army: Okamura Yasuji (seal). Representative of the Chinese Army: Xiong Bin (seal).</p>
<p>If we carefully analyze the full text of the ceasefire agreement, we can know that the function of the agreement is only to: 1. Restrict the Chinese army from stationing troops in the areas specified in Item 1 of the agreement, and 2. Stipulate that the maintenance of law and order in this area shall be the responsibility of the Chinese armed security forces. It absolutely does not involve central and local administration and is therefore not subject to any influence. Customs anti-smuggling belongs to the administrative scope, so it is clear and beyond doubt that all its land and sea armed anti-smuggling activities are not subject to any restrictions of the ceasefire agreement. The Japanese military in China is interfering with Hebei customs anti-smuggling and using the Tanggu Agreement, which cannot be used, as an excuse. Its illegality and unreasonableness are obvious.

<h3>Tianjin Customs and Beining Railway Negotiate Implementation of Anti-Smuggling Measures</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Lin Shize, Gillya, visited Chen Juesheng of the Beining Railway Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 18th to discuss the implementation of the Ministry of Finance's new anti-smuggling law. Customs officials stated that according to the Ministry's order, customs officers should enter stations and board trains for inspection. If smuggled goods are seized, conflicts may occur, depending on the railway's assistance. The result of the talks was that an agreement would be made without hindering train traffic. Further detailed discussions will be held in the coming days to make a decision. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In order to strictly suppress smuggling, Tianjin Customs intends to suggest to the Ministry of Finance that it imitate the methods of Fujian and Guangdong and establish more inspection sub-offices in key inland transportation areas to facilitate inspection and request assistance from administrative agencies. The Ministry of Finance's anti-smuggling measures for North China arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 17th. Due to environmental factors, customs still needs to study with various parties before implementation. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Previously, customs seized three smuggling sailboats with 800 bags of sugar at Dahongqiao. After negotiations by the Japanese Consul Nagai, a fine of 7,000 yuan was imposed, and the ships and goods were returned. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Reuters learned today that the Japanese authorities are still demanding the establishment of an independent customs administration in North China as the price for cooperating in curbing smuggling. At the same time, it is expected that after the completion of several new highways, smugglers can transport smuggled goods from the territory under the jurisdiction of the "East Hebei Autonomous Government" into various inland areas by road, without having to pass through the railway. Customs patrol boats are currently patrolling the coast outside Qikou, and private ships transporting smuggled goods are being detained, fined, and then released. It is reported that local officials are still discussing the political points of this issue with the central government. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Assist Anti-Smuggling Agencies: Award 40% of Seized Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed various provinces and cities to assist in anti-smuggling efforts and has promised to reward assisting agencies generously to encourage them. According to customs regulations, 40% of the value of smuggled goods seized due to informants' reports is awarded. It is now stipulated that the cases of smuggled goods seized by assisting agencies and handed over to customs for handling will also be rewarded according to the informant's reward method, with a 40% bonus. For example, if the value of seized smuggled goods is 10,000 yuan, a bonus of 4,000 yuan can be awarded. The above regulations have recently been sent to various provinces and cities for verification. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Our Protest Against Smuggling: The Japanese Side Actually Considers it Unjustified</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from Suma, the Consul General in Nanjing, today, stating that Foreign Minister Zhang had requested the Japanese government to reflect on the issue of smuggling in North China in a document on the 15th. Therefore, the Japanese government will recently express its protest to the Nanjing government, considering it unjustified and deciding to refute it with a reply. (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently awaiting a detailed report from Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, regarding the smuggling in North China, before replying to the Chinese government's protest on this matter. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the protest document regarding smuggling in North China submitted by Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Qun on May 16 has been mailed by the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing. The Japanese government is currently awaiting the details of this protest document. China requested the termination of a certain Japanese transportation company engaged in smuggling and requested the Japanese government to stop the activities of Japanese people engaged in smuggling in North China. It is believed here in Japan that not only China but also Japan is suffering from smuggling in North China because Japanese businesses are also greatly affected. Therefore, the Japanese government has jointly discussed with the Chinese authorities to crack down on smuggling by Japanese people. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on Smuggling: Japanese Credibility is Swept Away</h3>
<p>(London) The Times stated in an editorial today that the Japanese authorities' vague and evasive response to diplomatic protests raised due to smuggling in North China shows that the connivance of smuggling is not only an incident of local military behavior but also an intentional attack on government policy. According to news received in London, Tokyo may soon suggest to Nanjing in a semi-official manner to reduce tariffs or make North China customs independent in exchange for stopping smuggling. In fact, the result of recent events in North China will greatly damage Japan's dignity. Those Japanese who usually boast that maintaining order in the Far East is their mission cannot reconcile their hypocrisy with a policy aimed at bankrupting China's only stable government. Japan's current policy on smuggling inflicts serious financial losses on China, but Japan's national credibility is also swept away. The Huibao Morning Post also criticized the smuggling in North China this morning, stating that if Japanese power extends to Shanghai, the position of Chinese customs will immediately be in jeopardy. Although the position of various public bonds secured by tariffs is still safe, the time has come to adopt resolute measures to stop this erosion. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3>Hebei-Chahar Diplomacy: Still in Contact in Tianjin; Staff Officer Lin Visits Chen Zhongfu; Matsumuro May Return to Tianjin This Week</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Staff Officer Lin of the Tianjin Japanese Army visited Chen Zhongfu on the morning of the 18th to discuss the East Hebei issue. He expressed that it could definitely be canceled to avoid outside misunderstandings that the Japanese side was supporting it from the middle. However, it must wait until Matsumuro has consulted with the Kwantung Army headquarters before further discussions. Matsumuro may return from Changchun this week. Chen Zhongfu is scheduled to return to Ping on the 19th to report to Song. Our principles for resolving the East Hebei issue have been determined. Song will not come to Tianjin for the time being. He will come to Tianjin to return the visit after Field Marshal Tashiro arrives in Ping at the end of the month to meet with him to comply with diplomatic etiquette. Xiao is still in constant contact in Tianjin regarding diplomatic matters. (Special dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3>What is Japan's Stance on Increasing Troops in North China?</h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that after Undersecretary of State Phillips reiterated the Hull Doctrine, the US State Department immediately stated that "it is not a diplomatic warning to Japan, only a declaration of the US's moral stance." The United States, regarding Japan's increase of troops in North China, has interests that cannot be ignored. Therefore, it avoids diplomatic actions and makes a declaration of moral stance. In our country, however, we suffer the humiliation of being oppressed by a large army for no reason, and our territorial sovereignty is being violated. It is imperative to demand that Japan explain its position, urge it to be aware of the situation, and withdraw its troops. Japan, occupying the position of the victor, often blames China for mutual concessions. However, matters have reached the point where concessions are no longer acceptable. If the positions were reversed, how would Japan respond? The answer is self-evident.</p>
<p>We also know that Japan cites the Boxer Protocol as the basis for its troop deployments and uses the protection of its nationals and the prevention of communism as pretexts for increasing troops. However, the meaning of Articles 7 and 9 of the Boxer Protocol regarding the permission of various countries to station troops is only to protect embassies and maintain access to the sea. Under the circumstances at the time, this might still be arguable. But times have changed. Stationing troops is not even necessary, let alone increasing them. As for protecting its nationals, Japan has recently used special circumstances to significantly increase the number of its nationals in North China. This is indeed a fact. Let us discuss the facts. Based on what we have heard, there has been no news that Japanese nationals have suffered harm due to insufficient troop deployments, nor have Japanese nationals felt insecure in the past. On the contrary, only Japanese ruffians, taking advantage of the situation, act tyrannically, disturb local peace in China, bully the kind and weak Chinese people, and participate in the illegal activities of traitors. Reports in Chinese and foreign newspapers are as solid as ironclad cases. In such circumstances, they still talk about increasing troops to protect. One must ask, whom do they want to protect? Can the Japanese not laugh at their own absurdity? As for preventing communism, Japan's increase of troops at this time is either a missed opportunity or a lack of information. The bandits in Shanxi are already exhausted and have fled to Shaanxi. The passage from Ping to the sea has not been reported to have any development of red forces. The peace and stability of other places in the north are self-evident. Even if something happens, the Chinese army has the ability to quell it on its own. Why should the Japanese army come from afar to cultivate another's field while neglecting their own? As a Chinese comedic story, can Japan's intention to send heavy troops to prevent communism not make the world panic?</p>
<p>China's efforts to seek friendship with Japan in recent years can be described as utmost. Retreating the Northeast Army to Shaanxi and Gansu to avoid stimulating emotions, cracking down on anti-Japanese actions to reduce disputes, and conducting adjustments to international relations to seek permanent friendship. The Japanese political, diplomatic, and economic circles also felt satisfied, and they talked about cooperation and investment. However, military actions contradict Prime Minister Hirota's words of non-aggression and non-threat and continue to occur, to the point of deploying large numbers of troops for no reason. Are they not satisfied with maintaining a peaceful situation and thinking of ways to provoke China?</p>
<p>We can clearly understand that Japan's troop increase cannot be stopped by a few words. However, at a time when some unscrupulous merchants are smuggling for illegal profits to North China ports, damaging Chinese tariffs by 25.5 million yuan, attracting worldwide attention, and creating excuses to increase troops for no reason, we hope that the gentlemen of the Japanese government will, on the one hand, consider their moral stance and, on the other hand, carefully weigh the actual gains and losses. If they can have foresight and make a clear calculation of the world and their own country's situation, then the troops that have been sent can be withdrawn, and the departments that have not been opened can be stopped. If they do not show a ferocious face to China, genuine Sino-Japanese friendship can be discussed.</p>

<h3>Part of the Legal Tender Cash Reserve: Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange; Minimum Silver Reserve to Account for 25% of Total Issuance</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) In the draft declaration by Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance released by this agency last night, the sixteen characters "part still filled with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, of which the silver reserve" were mistakenly omitted under the first item, "its cash reserve." This is a serious error that could cause misunderstanding. Therefore, the full text of Minister Kong's declaration is re-recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since the government actively implemented the legal tender policy announced on November 3rd of last year, foreign exchange has stabilized and the national economy and people's lives have improved in the past six months. Based on past experience and a review of the domestic and international financial situation, the following measures are stipulated for implementation to ensure financial security and increase the guarantee of legal tender:</p>
<p>1.  To fully maintain the credibility of legal tender, the government will continue to use gold, silver, and foreign exchange to fill its cash reserve, of which the minimum silver reserve should account for 25% of the total issuance.</p>
<p>2.  To facilitate merchants and the public, the government will immediately mint half-dollar and one-dollar silver coins to complete the types of coinage.</p>
<p>3.  To enhance the stability of the legal tender, the government has raised a substantial amount for its cash reserve and will sufficiently increase gold and foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Based on the above regulations, China's monetary system will maintain its independent status and will not be constrained by changes in any other country's monetary system. The status of legal tender is stable, and the national economy will trend toward prosperity, which is deeply believed.</p>

<h3>Japan Increases Troops in North China; Tension Between Japan and Russia Intensifies; Controlling Beiping and Tianjin, Peering at Outer Mongolia, Japan Advances its Continental Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) Diplomatic observers here stated today that the recent troop movements by Japan have increased the risk of a war between Japan and Russia. Experts generally believe that Japan's recent increase of troops in North China is actually more noteworthy than simply controlling Beiping and Tianjin, as North China can serve as a base for Japan to conquer Outer Mongolia. Military experts acknowledge that the current number of troops is insufficient to serve as the vanguard for a war between Japan and Russia, but it can be used to prepare logistical and air bases. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The "Pravda" commented on the North China Incident, stating that "Japan has made full preparations in North China and is using the international situation to occupy North China, just as Italy annexed Abyssinia. Japanese troops have arrived in Tianjin and are advancing towards Beiping. At the same time, Japanese and Manchukuo troops are moving towards Chahar Province. The Japanese military is making North China an important base, not only to seize China but also to seize other parts of the Asian continent." (TASS Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Progress in Chinese Finance; Significant Turnaround in Industry and Commerce; Japanese Policy Endangers the Overall Situation, British People Still Need to Act Cautiously</h3>
<p>(London) The Financial News devoted a four-column article to detailing the financial and industrial conditions in China, emphasizing that the monetary reform implemented in November of last year has brought about a significant turnaround in Chinese industry and commerce. It then used the number of banknotes issued to prove that the Chinese government is adhering to the commitment to avoid inflation, thereby restoring credibility. Interest rates have been greatly reduced, and the easing of finances has allowed the provinces to undertake large-scale capital programs. Export trade has greatly increased. The new plan announced by Minister Kong will appropriately complete the reform and further strengthen credit in diplomatic terms. This new plan seems to avoid offending Japan, but China's efforts to win the trust of foreign governments and the financial community have had a dangerous impact, even alarming Japan. Japan's aggressive policy constantly disrupts the progress of China's political and economic situation, and now reveals its significant harm. Therefore, although there has been significant progress in Chinese commerce and finance, we still need to act cautiously regarding its future. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Minister Kong's Remarks on Currency Reform; British Financial Circles Express Welcome but Worry About Impact of Smuggling</h3>
<p>(London) Bankers and merchants interviewed by Reuters welcomed Minister Kong's statement yesterday that the Chinese government is striving to develop and consolidate the currency reform implemented last November and praised the success of China's managed currency. However, they expressed great concern about the impact of smuggling, with some not believing that Japan would want to destroy Chinese customs, while others worried that Japanese soldiers would deliberately undermine the stability of the Chinese government. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial Times gave great importance this morning to Minister Kong's announcement of measures to consolidate China's currency reform, saying that China's decision to increase gold and foreign exchange as reserves for its banknote issuance can be seen as a response to rumors that China will restore the silver standard. The Daily Mail also commented, saying that Minister Kong's announcement seems to indicate that silver will still be an important part of the affairs of the Central Bank of China, and that China has reached an understanding with the United States.

<h3>Japan Actively Pursuing Cultural Work Towards China; Friendship in Name, Aggression in Reality</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun reported today that the Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to increase the annual expenditure for Japanese cultural activities in China to 4 million yuan, with the aim of: Setting up Japanese language departments in Chinese universities; Seeking economic and cultural cooperation with private organizations in China; Establishing Japanese cultural libraries in various parts of China. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Foreign Minister Arita took office, the Foreign Ministry has resolved to actively promote Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation and has decided to propose to the Diet a revision of the special account for cultural undertakings in China, increasing the budget from 1 million to 4 million yuan. The additional one million yuan will be used to start new work. The general direction is as follows:</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry's cultural undertakings in China have traditionally aimed at organizing and promoting the study of Eastern culture and assisting the success of Chinese academics and education to promote the development of Japanese research on China. This single-minded and lofty purpose has contributed little to genuine cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. Foreign Minister Arita has held the opinion since his time as Director of the Asian Bureau that Sino-Japanese relations should not be limited to the study of outdated scholarship or archaeological research. Instead, work should first be done to strengthen friendly forces between the two peoples. According to the Foreign Minister's plan, it is planned to implement international cultural-colored work in cultural undertakings in China, namely: Establishing Japanese language and cultural lectureships in Chinese universities; Economic and cultural cooperation between Chinese and Japanese non-governmental organizations; Establishing new Japanese cultural libraries in various parts of China; and actively introducing Japanese culture, mediating exchanges in Sino-Japanese sports, drama, and art. Miyazawa, the newly appointed Second Section Chief of the Cultural Undertakings Department, has been ordered by the Foreign Minister to inspect various parts of China to make preparations.

<h3>Reform of the Japanese Army's Official System; Unification of the Military Structure; Minister of the Army Has the Authority to Appoint Senior Officials</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army authorities decided today to revise the official system, limiting the qualifications for the Minister of the Army to active-duty generals or lieutenant generals. Therefore, the tradition of mutually selecting the Minister of the Army, the Chief of the General Staff, and the Inspector General of Military Education has also been abolished. From now on, the Minister of the Army will have the sole authority to appoint officials. The Army is striving to unify the department through this method, which is a very meaningful point. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The highest personnel matters of the Army are, as a rule, decided by consultation among the Minister of the Army, the Chief of the General Staff, and the Inspector General of Military Education. This is because the scope of appointment of the Minister of the Army and the Vice Minister was expanded to reserve duty and retirement in Taisho 2 (1913) to prevent ministers of the Army with political colors and officers from lacking fairness and appropriateness in personnel matters. However, since this concern no longer exists with the decision to revise, the above-mentioned tradition will naturally disappear. In the future, the Minister of the Army will preside over personnel matters based on the various regulations of the official system, while the three senior officials will remain the highest executive bodies of the Army, which is no different from before. Even regarding personnel, the opinion of the three senior officials is not ignored. Moreover, this decision to revise eliminates the system by which the department can be controlled from outside the department. Therefore, the Army's structure can be expected to be unified and strengthened in the future. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Preparing for War; Campaign to Manufacture "National Defense Rings"; Personal Treasure in Peacetime, National Resource in Wartime</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Supported by the Ministries of the Army, Navy, and Finance, as well as the Cabinet Resources Bureau, the Mint Bureau, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and the Tokyo Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Platinum Promotion Association of Japan has launched a campaign to manufacture platinum rings called "National Defense Rings." These rings are intended to be personal treasures in peacetime and become national resources in the event of war, serving as an active national defense movement. These platinum rings are stamped with the image of the Rising Sun flag and cherry blossoms on the surface and the certification mark of the Mint Bureau of the Ministry of Finance on the inside, indicating that the government has certified their genuine value. Platinum is an indispensable mineral for national defense in the manufacture of military supplies and precision weapons. Japan does not produce platinum and imports it from abroad. If the supply becomes inconvenient one day, then if one-tenth of the Japanese population, namely seven million people, were to use one ring each and each person stored one momme (Japanese weight unit) of platinum, it would be possible to obtain 7,000 kan (Japanese weight unit) of platinum, which could maintain military needs for two or three years in an emergency. The value of each ring is 16 yuan, 25 fen. (Domei Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Right-Wing Groups Secretly and Intensively Active; Expressing Dissatisfaction with the Current Cabinet, Tokyo Authorities on High Alert</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the February 26th Incident, the Police Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a nationwide order to the police to seriously investigate the state of social order. The authorities are paying special attention to the actions of far-right groups and the instigation of other subversive extremists. According to the investigation by the Police Bureau, the recent activities of far-right groups are as follows:</p>
<p>As a result of the general election, the right-wing suffered a major defeat. Since then, they have strengthened their party forces and continued to be intensely active, with the goal of reforming the country. They believe that unless the root causes of the February 26th Incident are eliminated, the problem will not be solved. They express dissatisfaction with the attitude of □□ towards □□ and the police's crackdown on reactionaries. They randomly distribute strange documents, expressing outrage at the authorities' handling of the February 26th Incident, and spread various rumors that disrupt military order and demoralize the people, advocating for the Showa Restoration and overthrowing the Hirota Cabinet. Their actions are truly worrying. They believe that the lifting of the martial law order is an opportunity for free activity and are currently adopting a wait-and-see attitude.

<h3>Major Renovation Plan for Korean Railways; Replacing New Tracks to Facilitate Military Transport</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Government Committee Member Imaida and Director Yoshida of the Korean Railway Bureau explained the new plan for the Korean Railway at the House of Representatives Committee on the 18th, saying that the Korean Railway runs through the central part of Korea and is currently implementing a plan to completely convert to 100-pound rail, which will be completed by Showa 15 (1940). The 6,500-ton connecting ship currently under construction will be completed in June and will be able to set sail in November. The ship is twice as large as the existing ships, so it can accommodate a large number of passengers. One more express train will be added, and temporary trains are prepared to be opened at any time to facilitate transportation. (Domei Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Sino-German Goodwill; Presenting Hitler with a Japanese Sword</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Seki-cho, Mino Province, Japan, has traditionally produced famous swords. Recently, the Mino Swordsmiths Association was established to promote the Japanese Bushido spirit. Dr. Fonz, a special envoy from Germany, came to Japan to photograph the manufacturing process of Japanese swords. The association took this opportunity to present a famous sword to German President Hitler, and a presentation ceremony is scheduled to be held at the German Embassy in Tokyo on the 19th.

The government will provide each household with a certain number of mu of cultivated land. The Manchuria Immigration Association in Tokyo is currently conducting publicity and recruitment. The distribution of land, financial guidance, and land reclamation will be handled by the Manchuria Colonization Company. (China United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan has long been known as the "Immigration Kingdom," as the county's emigration overseas is second to none in Japan.

<h3>Insulting Remarks by Japanese Diet Member; Chinese Students in Japan Express Outrage; Will Urge Ambassador Xu to Negotiate Seriously</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Chinese students in Japan have decided to organize a "Committee for Negotiations on the Mikami Incident" to deal with the insulting remarks of the Japanese House of Peers member Mikami regarding the name of our country. In addition to requesting the embassy to negotiate sternly to maintain the dignity of the state, it will also send people to various parts of Japan to contact all overseas Chinese to jointly express their protest to Japan.

<h3>Japan's Political Warfare Center Shifts from the House of Representatives to the House of Peers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) With the special session of the Diet entering its third period, the budget bill and various issues have been transferred to the House of Peers, and the debate will reach its climax. The general budget meeting at 11:00 this morning will touch on the core of the policy and carefully deliberate it. Although the passage of the budget bill in the House of Representatives has a feeling of "a great wind passing," there are still important bills proposed by the government. Even within the Minseito Party, which is self-appointed as the ruling party, there are opposing factions. Therefore, the committee this morning failed to make a decision. After passing it with hope conditions today, it will be urgently placed on the agenda of this meeting. Because of the opposition of the smaller factions, the discussion will definitely be heated. The retirement reserve fund, rice law, important industry control law, and automobile manufacturing law are expected to be passed and returned to the House of Peers today. (Dentsu Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The special session of the Diet is only three weeks long, but the government has proposed as many as 46 bills, which is not much different in substance from a regular session of the Diet. The supplementary budget for this year has already passed the House of Representatives, and the general policy direction of the current cabinet has also been discussed. The passage of the budget bill by both houses is a foregone conclusion and is not a problem. However, the fate of the important bills prepared by the current cabinet is a problem. The House of Representatives is now discussing the government's important bills to determine their fate. The House of Peers is focusing on the budget bill and deliberating on the government's general administration, so these two or three days are the most critical period of this resolution meeting. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers General Budget Meeting opened its second meeting at 10:00 AM on the 18th. Kohachi Okochi asked:</p>
<p>The government and the two houses of the Diet should work together to establish a movement for parliamentary politics and constitutional politics. The government's policy of reforming the administration should not be implemented hastily and must be carried out with caution. The bills prepared by the previous cabinet should be studied again before being submitted to the Diet.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota replied: The various bills submitted this time have already been discussed repeatedly, so they are submitted to the Diet with a view to resolving them.</p>
<p>Okochi asked: The government is widely expected to achieve national unity, and we also deeply hope for genuine national unity.</p>
<p>Hirota replied: Today, both domestic and foreign affairs are in extraordinary times, and national unity is essential. Each cabinet member is also doing their best to cooperate in fulfilling their responsibility of providing guidance.</p>
<p>Okochi also asked questions about diplomatic issues and tax system issues until 11:55 AM, when the meeting was temporarily adjourned. The meeting will resume in the afternoon. (Domei News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Naval Talks to Begin This Week; Quantitative Limitations Not Within the Scope of Discussion; Qualitative Limitations Dependent on Japan's Attitude</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondents have learned that future Anglo-Russian naval talks are expected to make rapid progress. The London Naval Treaty recently concluded may be an obstacle to these naval talks, but only in respect of the ban on the construction of warships between 8,000 and 20,000 tons. The two sides will likely be in contact within the week between the Soviet Russian Embassy in London and officials from the Foreign Office or the Admiralty to begin the talks. The plenipotentiaries for the Russian side are the Russian Ambassador, Mr. Maisky, and the Soviet Russian Naval Commissioner, Mr. Kiyongsky. Rumors that the talks may not proceed smoothly because the Soviet Union will demand that its navy be equal to the German navy in the Baltic Sea have been denied by those responsible for the talks. It is said that the talks have nothing to do with quantitative limitations. Their sole purpose is to conclude an Anglo-Russian treaty and to incorporate into the treaty the qualitative limitations and the prior exchange of shipbuilding procedures contained in the London Naval Treaty. The implementation of any qualitative limitations will naturally depend on Japan's attitude, just as the London Treaty itself depends on Japan's shipbuilding procedures. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Increased Naval Power a Hidden Concern for Britain; Commentary from the London Morning Post</h3>
<p>(London) The list of the German naval fleet was released yesterday by the country's Admiralty. (See yesterday's telegram) The Morning Post wrote an article commenting on it, expressing considerable dissatisfaction in its tone, saying, "The German fleet list includes nine warships, namely one cruiser and eight submarines, which were previously unknown to the outside world. We must recognize that this is a common technique of German leader Hitler, and that technique is to place accomplished facts before all countries. According to news obtained by the naval affairs reporter of this newspaper, the cruiser has a displacement of 10,000 tons and is equipped with 8-inch caliber guns, which are prohibited from being built before 1942 under the naval agreements of Britain, France, and the United States. As for the submarines, they are generally large and capable of sailing in the ocean. It is also possible that the above-mentioned ships are more powerful than similar ships placed by the British Navy. The same is true of the sixteen destroyers currently owned by Germany. If so, then the German naval fleet is truly a formidable enemy for Britain." (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Palestine Remains Tense; Continued Clashes Between Arabs and Jews; Authorities Announce Nighttime Curfew</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: On Saturday night, an Arab opened fire on the crowd in a movie theater, and after he had used all his ammunition, escaped. As a result, three Jews died, causing the situation to become even more tense. Jews, alarmed by the recent violence, mostly did not dare to leave their homes. The government has decided to adopt strict measures to maintain law and order and has announced a nighttime curfew from 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM, and ordered soldiers and police to patrol the streets and search pedestrians. Today, troops will march through the streets to demonstrate. Riots also occurred in Haifa yesterday, and some people set fire to and destroyed some houses. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The Arab-led boycott and strike movement and civil disobedience movement are still underway, so the conflict between Arabs and Jews has not eased slightly. The authorities have recently decided to cut off traffic in all areas of the city at night to prevent incidents. British High Commissioner Sir Arthur Wauchope recently suggested that the Arab Higher Committee send a delegation to London to meet face-to-face with the British government and organize an investigation team on the ground in Palestine to study the issue of Jewish immigration. Both of these proposals were firmly rejected by the committee, which believes that the Arab race will not negotiate as long as the act of Jewish immigration does not stop.

<h3>British Government Organizes Committee to Investigate Causes of the Unrest</h3>
<p>(London) Colonial Secretary Thomas stated in the House of Commons today that the government has decided to organize a Royal Commission to investigate the causes of the current disturbances in Palestine and the complaints of Arabs and Jews, but without involving the issue of the Palestinian mandate.

<h3>Italy's Invasion of Abyssinia: Use of Poison Gas is the Biggest Reason for Abyssinian Defeat: Even Valiant and Skilled Soldiers Cannot Resist; Turkish Military Advisor Details the Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Port Said, Egypt: Turkish General Wehib Pasha, a military advisor to the Abyssinian National Army, arrived here last night from Abyssinia. Crowds gathered at the dock to welcome him, eager to see his distinguished appearance. After landing, Wehib Pasha drove to a hotel and met with Abyssinian officers. He plans to leave for Cairo today. Wehib Pasha told the press that the defenses he had set up in Abyssinia were like copper walls and iron ramparts, indestructible and comparable to the "Hindenburg Line" in the European War. However, due to the Italian army's use of poisonous gas, even valiant and skilled Abyssinian soldiers could not resist, and therefore had to withdraw. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Son-in-Law Returns Triumphantly: Mussolini Greets Him in the Rain</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini's two sons, Bruno and Vittorio, and his son-in-law, Propaganda Minister Count Ciano, returned from the front. They transferred to a plane at Brindisi and returned to Rome. They arrived at the Littorio airfield near Rome at 3:35 PM. The Prime Minister, accompanied by his wife and children, as well as representatives from various Fascist Party organizations, welcomed them at the airfield. The representatives of each organization held small flags. The Prime Minister, wearing a light gray suit, sat on the ground waiting for the plane to arrive. It started raining, and a young member of the party offered an umbrella, but the Prime Minister smiled and declined, preferring to wait in the rain. Soon, the plane appeared in the sky, circling and performing various maneuvers before landing. The crowd surrounding the airfield surged forward to welcome them warmly. The Prime Minister and his wife waited for their two sons and son-in-law to disembark before embracing and kissing them. They then reviewed the troops at the airfield together before driving back to their residence to enjoy family time. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Rome Talks Involve Austrian Internal Affairs: Italian Prime Minister Supports Prince Starhemberg; Austrian Home Guard Pledges Loyalty to Former Leader</h3>
<p>(Rome) The details of the talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austria's deposed leader Starhemberg yesterday are unknown, leading to much speculation. Italian officials claim it was a private matter, but it is widely believed that Austrian internal affairs were discussed. According to those closely involved in Austrian politics, Starhemberg wants to continue fighting for the Home Guard, the Austrian Fascist organization, but will wait for a suitable opportunity and does not want to take any action at present. (Reuter, 17th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Although Starhemberg, the leader of the Home Guard and former Deputy Chancellor, has been stripped of all important positions, he remains a powerful figure in Austrian politics. Members of the Home Guard here learned today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has agreed to support Starhemberg as the supreme leader of the Home Guard. In addition, Major Babarurenfield, the new Deputy Chancellor, also sent a letter to Starhemberg in the name of all Home Guard leaders, promising him their loyalty. (Reuter, 17th)</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Holds Meeting: Eden Reports on the Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting at 10:30 this morning at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. In addition to reporting on the diplomatic situation, Foreign Secretary Eden also provided an explanation of his recent meetings in Geneva with French Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu and in Paris with Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party of that country. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph recently reported that the German government was quite dissatisfied after receiving the list of questions previously submitted by the British government. It is expected that Chancellor Hitler will first raise several questions to the British government before replying, the most important of which is what the nature of the League of Nations will be if Germany rejoins it in the future. Regarding the issue of reforming the League of Nations, when the British Cabinet held a meeting today, Foreign Secretary Eden will submit a report on the opinions expressed by the chief representatives of various countries at the last meeting of the Council of the League of Nations. These opinions can be summarized as follows: "Countries within the same region that have vital interests at stake and must immediately implement military sanctions to deal with aggressor nations must mutually conclude regional mutual assistance agreements. These agreements must be incorporated into the League of Nations structure and form an integral and indivisible part of it. However, any act of aggression should still be submitted to the League of Nations for handling before implementing mutual assistance measures. As for other countries (referring to those not belonging to the above regions) that have the ability and are willing to participate in mutual assistance measures, the measures they take should be determined by the League of Nations. In general, if the League of Nations can be reorganized in this way, Japan may be able to rejoin, and the United States may also join the League of Nations on this basis." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>British and French Differ on German Issue in Paris Talks: France Advocates Reopening Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Eden returned to England last Friday (the 15th) from Geneva, stopping here for a short time. He met with Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party and future Prime Minister. The famous journalist Bettina recently published an article in the Paris Echo newspaper, revealing the details of the meeting. It is said that the two discussed the Italian-Abyssinian issue and Germany's abolition of the Locarno Treaty. Regarding the former issue, Léon Blum would be happy to support any suggestions from the British Cabinet, but he himself does not intend to initiate anything. As for the issue of Germany's abolition of the Locarno Treaty, Léon Blum believes that "if we want British and American public opinion to support France's views and allow the French people to feel at ease in their conscience, then it is appropriate to reconvene the Disarmament Conference at this time." Regarding this point, Bettina added a comment, saying that Léon Blum's proposal has little chance of success and is likely to cause danger, "completely despairing of European peace." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Future French Prime Minister's Speech: Emphasis on Peace in Foreign Policy: Willing to Maintain Friendly Relations with Democratic Countries of the World</h3>
<p>(Paris) Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party, delivered a speech at a banquet at the American Club here. The content of the speech varies greatly in the reports of various newspapers. The party's official newspaper, Le Populaire, recently published an article by Léon Blum to explain the meaning of this speech, which roughly stated, "We will never lead France into war because of envy of certain political systems, nor because our comrades have suffered ill-treatment under those systems, nor because of intentional promotion of revolutionary ideas. On the contrary, if there are those who treat us with harmony and friendship, we will always reciprocate with special friendliness. Therefore, if there is a country that always maintains freedom and democracy, France will naturally yearn for and follow it. We believe that this purpose is not beyond the norm and is also reasonable. This so-called consistently maintaining freedom and democracy refers to the Anglo-Saxon countries (Britain and the United States) and the democratic countries of continental Europe, such as the Soviet Union, Spain, and the Little Entente countries, including countless others."

<h3>Reorganization of the British Cabinet: Realized on Pentecost: Hoare to Make a Comeback</h3>

<h3>National Mourning for Three Days After the Death of Former Greek Prime Minister: Tsaldaris' Sincerity, Integrity, and Contributions to the Nation Are Conclusively Evaluated</h3>
<p>Athens: Following the death of former Prime Minister Tsaldaris, it has now been decided that the funeral will be held on Tuesday (the 19th). King George II, in memory of his past merits, has specially sent a palace minister to express condolences to Mrs. Tsaldaris and ordered that the funeral ceremony be the same as that of a Prime Minister who dies in office. His Majesty will also personally attend the memorial service to show his respect.

As for the members of the People's Party (the party led by Tsaldaris), they will observe mourning for forty days to show their grief. Tsaldaris had many political enemies during his lifetime, but now that he has passed away, everyone praises him for his sincerity, integrity, gentle demeanor, and contributions to the nation. Current Prime Minister Metaxas also said that Tsaldaris has a noble character and a broad mind, and is undoubtedly one of the leading figures in modern Greek politics. Some political figures predict that after Tsaldaris' death, Prime Minister Metaxas will be able to form a united front in parliament to confront the Liberal Party. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>German Political-Religious Dispute</h3>
<p>Berlin: The conflict between civil and Christian authorities has not yet subsided. A church that propagates Christianity among Jews has resolutely refused the police chief's request to dissolve the church. Today, the National Socialist Party has begun a movement to exclude the church. Several National Socialist Party groups have obtained permission from the Minister of Religious Affairs, Crownel, and are now trying to interfere in church affairs and provide religious instruction to schoolchildren. Several pastors have recently been expelled from church districts for disobeying the orders of religious authorities. (Reuter, 17th)</p>
<h3>Bloodless Revolution in Bolivia: Provisional Military Government Established: Leaning to the Left, the Country is Peaceful; Colonel Toro Elected New President</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires: According to news from the Bolivian capital, the army suddenly launched a revolution and overthrew the government. This news has been confirmed. The reason is that a general strike occurred in the country recently, and some soldiers voiced their support for the striking workers. Lieutenant Colonel Buch, the commander of the capital garrison, immediately led troops to drive out the current President Susano and seized power. The revolutionary army then elected Colonel Toro as the new president and Baourdivisa as the foreign minister. Toro is currently residing in the Chaco region. Before he takes office, Lieutenant Colonel Buch will temporarily exercise administrative power.

<p>La Paz: Taking advantage of the general strike here, the army authorities carried out a bloodless coup and seized power. After President Susano was forced to resign, General Pennarenda immediately recruited Colonel Mosanna, Colonel Toro, and Colonel Puskher to form a military government to stop the general strike. This decisive coup occurred after the failure of the Chaco War and a long period of disputes over economic and social reconstruction issues. A document issued by the military government stated that this coup had no old grudges. The new government allows President Susano full freedom and will maintain various commercial agreements and treaties internationally. The document continued, stating that the Susano government was unable to solve the people's immediate problems, as evidenced by the recent repeated general strikes, and that the constitution was outdated and difficult to implement. It is predicted here that the army authorities may be able to manipulate the general election on May 31. At the same time, those who participated in the Chaco War will strike on Saturday to protest that they can only obtain the jobs of miners. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>La Paz: Bolivian President Susano was forced to resign today, and the army immediately occupied the government and guaranteed the maintenance of national security.

Taymio was elected as president in the same year and should have exercised his powers on March 5, 1935, but Tay never took office, so the parliament decided on August 4 of that year to extend Susano's term to August 15, 1936.

<h3>Due to Political Unrest, Europeans Flock to American Citizenship: The Majority are Jews; the U.S. Passport Division is Extremely Busy</h3>
<p>(Washington) Due to the political unrest in Europe, there has been a large increase in the number of Europeans applying for American citizenship. The State Department needs to increase its staff. The most citizenship petitions come from Germany, mostly from Jewish people, who hold dual citizenship. Mrs. Shipley, the head of the Passport Division of the State Department, explained to a congressional committee the reason why the Passport Division's funding must be increased, saying that those who have been living abroad are now requesting recognition of their American citizenship. In most cases, they are foreigners and have no basis for claiming American citizenship. However, driven by the current situation, they have no choice but to renounce their original citizenship and request to become American citizens. Therefore, the Passport Division's workload has increased. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<h3>Internal Strife in the Japanese Seiyukai</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The internal strife in the Japanese Seiyukai has gradually resurfaced, namely the issue of President Suzuki's retirement and the replacement of several important cadres.

Therefore, some radical elements have proposed dissolution, believing that it is necessary to dissolve the party completely and reorganize with like-minded people in order to eliminate the danger of internal strife.

<h3>New Anti-Theft Method in Paris: Alarm Bells Lose Effectiveness; Modified Foot Pedal Mechanism</h3>
<p>(Paris) Although incidents of armed robbery in stores are not common here, they are enough to cause concern for the police. Until now, most stores have installed alarm bells. In the event of a robbery, all one has to do is press the alarm bell, and the police will rush to the scene immediately. However, now the bandits are becoming increasingly bold. Once they break into the store, they use handguns to force employees to raise their hands, making it impossible to call the police, so the alarm bells have lost their effectiveness. The police station has recently come up with a method that is enough to deter bandits and protect the safety of stores. The method is to install a foot pedal mechanism under the desks or safes in banks and stores, similar to the accelerator pedal of a car. Even under the threat of a handgun, store employees can still use their feet to calmly activate the mechanism. At the same time, a loud alarm will sound in the police station, so the police will arrive at the scene of the incident by motorcycle before the bandits can empty the safe and loot freely.

<h3>The Function of the "Iron Lung": Regulating Air and Temperature</h3>
<p>Slater, the 25-year-old son of a wealthy Chicago businessman, recently traveled the world with his parents on the Empress of Britain. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Peiping, he suddenly suffered from paralysis. It is said that he contracted the disease in Shanghai. He was admitted to the Union Hospital for treatment. On April 1, the doctor determined that there was no hope for his life, but after using the "iron lung," his life was extended. Today, there is hope that he can recover completely. This kind of "iron lung," of which there is only one in Asia, is a device that regulates air and temperature. When Slater fell ill, there happened to be such a device in Tianjin, stored in the vault of the Xinhua Bank. Without this device, the patient would not be able to breathe. Therefore, the hospital authorities urgently negotiated with the bank and moved the device to Peiping. This young American was able to maintain his life because of this device. Otherwise, he would have died weeks ago. Slater's father feared that there might be more than one person who needed this device, so he generously donated one. Therefore, the Union Hospital will now have two "iron lungs." (Reuter, 18th)</p>

<h3>Fujian Province Improves Tea and Porcelain Industries; Joins Three Provinces in Tea Industry, Spinning, Weaving, and Transportation; Holds Porcelain Industry Exhibition to Seek Improvement</h3>
<p>Improving Tea Production: A dispatch from Fuzhou states that China's tea production is most abundant in the four provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. In its heyday, Anhui's Huicha tea and Fujian's Yancha tea were popular all over the world. The number of farmers who relied on tea picking for a living each year was no less than several hundred thousand. Now, there has been a sharp decline. The reasons are poor quality, inconvenient transportation, and the monopoly of tea merchants. The three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui, in view of this, will soon join forces to control the transportation of tea, establish large-scale improvement farms to alleviate the suffering of the people, and restore past rights and interests. The tea industry in this province, in view of the decline of the tea industry in this province, has decided to join the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces in controlling transportation and engaging in improvement organizations, and the provincial authorities will set up large-scale improvement farms. It has been found that the bulk of this province's tea leaves are sold to various ports in North China. In recent years, the sales have been extremely sluggish due to the transit through foreign territory and the imposition of an additional tariff by the "puppet state", making the overall cost very high and difficult to compete with foreign teas. Last year, there was still a large accumulation of tea leaves in storage. The amount of goods shipped to Tianjin this year has been greatly reduced, and the price is significantly lower than last year. However, overseas sales and prices have recently been relatively stable. Although each tea company has strong capital, this year's business has been tightened. According to sources in Anhui, the tea from Anhui that is transported to Fujian to be smoked and mixed with jasmine flowers has also seen a decrease in sales due to the impact of the economic downturn. The amount of tea that needs to be smoked with flowers has decreased accordingly. Moreover, jasmine flowers are also produced in Taiwan. In recent years, a portion of tea leaves has been transported to Taiwan for smoking with flowers, but its fragrance is slightly inferior to that of Fujian. This is because the soil in Fuzhou is fertile, so its fragrance is extremely rich. In addition, Changle County also grows alfalfa jasmine, which is only separated from Fuzhou by water, but its fragrance is not as good as that of Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Revitalizing the Porcelain Industry: The porcelain products of Dehua in southern Fujian and Minqing in northern Fujian are sufficient to meet the needs of this province. If they can be improved and the output increased, they can also be transported to other provinces for sale, so that the products of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi will not monopolize the market. The Department of Construction, in view of this, established porcelain improvement farms in the two counties last year, and sent technicians to provide guidance, so that the products gradually become more technical. Since the improvement, the products have become increasingly excellent. The Department of Construction plans to hold a porcelain industry exhibition in this province to promote the porcelain products of this province, hoping that they can learn from each other, learn from their experiences, and make improvements. It has ordered the department to draft rules for soliciting products and awarding prizes. The opening date is expected to be in June. In addition, the Feiluan bowl kiln in Ningde County, eastern Fujian, produces bowls, plates, and the like. The quality is rough and heavy, and the price is extremely cheap. They are sold to various provinces in Shandong and Hebei, and the sales volume is very large. Most of the men and women in the area make bowl blanks and earn more than two hundred articles per day. However, due to adhering to old methods and not making improvements, sales have declined day by day, and more and more kiln households have closed down, and many men and women workers have lost their jobs. Wu Yangxian, an executive member of the Fujian National Goods Promotion Association and an assistant to the Minhai Customs, was previously working at Sandu Pass. Because Feiluan is only separated from Sandu by water, he would often cross the river to guide the improvement of manufacturing during his spare time and lend capital. For a time, the bowl industry had hopes of revival, but soon Wu left Sandu, and no one continued to carry out the work. Now that the authorities are improving the porcelain industry, if they can send personnel to provide guidance, the Feiluan porcelain industry can also be improved accordingly, and many unemployed workers can be rescued.

<h3>Travel Notes in Qinghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>Fierce Tibetan Dogs</p>
<p>The village raises many large, shaggy dogs. () They are two and a half feet tall, four feet long from head to tail, with shaggy yellow fur, sharp eyes, a wide muzzle, and a fierce personality. They are the best guard dogs for the Tibetans.</p>
<p>I experienced the ferocity of Tibetan dogs during my time in Qorok. Once, at night, my servant was attacked by eight Tibetan dogs, and they bit him all over, leaving him severely injured.</p>
<p>However, even if a Tibetan's dog bites you, you cannot kill it. This is the rule of the Tibetans in this area. If you kill it, you must pay with your life. Sometimes the price of a dog's life is equal to a human life, because dogs are the protectors of their property (cattle and sheep). But if you are bitten by a dog, the dog owner must also come out to invite you to his house, say good words, and apologize. If you refuse his invitation, and then negotiate with him later, he may offer a substantial gift, or lead a yak, to compensate for your medical expenses.</p>
<p>Generally, the dogs of Tibetan families are carefully chained to the front of the tent or door during the day to prevent them from biting passersby. If guests come, the owner must first go out to stop the dogs. At night, the dogs are placed in the sheepfold. But the dogs here are also allowed to run around the yard during the day. This is a special situation, so we must be careful of their attacks every time we go out. Tibetans are good at stealing and robbing. According to them, thieves are also afraid of large, shaggy dogs, which bark and bite as soon as they see them. Therefore, when they go out to steal, they must first bring a bag of meat bones. When they see a dog, they feed it a bone. The dog, having something to eat, neglects its guard duty, and the thieves can do whatever they want. If there are many dogs and few bones, the dogs that don't have anything to eat will still bite him. He first lies on the ground and pretends to be dead. The dog comes to sniff his face, thinking he is dead, and then walks away.</p>
<p>Wild Sheep by the Sea</p>
<p>"Qinghai" is very close to this place, said to be only one stop away. The next morning, I asked the steward to dispatch three Ula horses and a guide. We put a bedroll and a few rolls of photos on our saddles.</p>
<p>The bright sun warmed the air. A group of four of us rode into the canyon from the south. The valley was very quiet. We only heard the small sound of hooves. Startled wild rabbits in the deep grass jumped and ran on the hillside. A few small rabbits, unaware of the danger, stopped in front of the horses and did not dodge. They had gray coats, beautiful long ears, and agile bodies. When we got off our horses to try to catch them, they cleverly slipped away.</p>
<p>After turning over two hillsides, the terrain was more open, and the sea breeze began to blow gently. The further we went, the stronger the wind and the more intense the cold. Our hands, feet, ears, and noses were all frozen.</p>
<p>In the distant mountain gullies, there were shadows of four or five black tents. The big shaggy dogs saw us and barked again. Turning past a mountain ridge, there was an Obo (a Mongolian mountain god) on the top, made of a pile of rubble and branches. A few pieces of red wool were hanging on the tree branches, which was the only target on our long journey.</p>
<p>After walking for thirty li, we saw a vast open beach in front of us, knowing that the sea was near. We all spurred our horses and became happy, forgetting the cold and pain in our hands and feet.</p>
<p>A mountain gully flowed down from the hillside in a winding path, straight into the sea. The riverbank was covered with thick yellow grass. We found a group of thirty wild sheep foraging in the grass. Seeing us, they were not surprised. Their elongated horns, and gray-yellow fur, reflected the pale yellow sunlight, making them look even more beautiful. Now the distance between the two sides was only eighty meters. They all looked up at this group of travelers from afar. We didn't want to disturb their natural life, so as soon as they saw us, they scurried up the mountain.</p>
<p>The coastline was faintly visible from here, about ten li away. Our watches showed only 10:00 AM. We expected to be able to rush back today. The horses also knew what we wanted. They galloped, mostly on flat beaches, which seemed like a natural racetrack. We lay on the saddles and only heard the whistling of the wind in our ears. A few pheasants were startled by us and soared into the sky, circling around.</p>
<p>The Scenery of Qinghai</p>
<p>By the time the horses stopped, we were already on the vast beach by the sea, on the Ximala Bu beach. The seawater was all frozen into hard blocks of ice, bordered by a layer of gray-white snow. Looking at the Qinghai horizon, the sea was a clean white color, dazzling with shimmering sunlight, and felt blinding. There were traces of ice breaking along the edge, showing its solid and crystalline layers. We stepped onto the ice, which was as smooth as a stone slab, and walked tens of feet into the center of the sea without feeling any danger. If it were in the dead of winter, we would definitely have the heroic interest in stepping on the ice to the sea center mountain.</p>
<p>Looking back at the shore, there was a fine, soft yellow sand, like a desert, with not a single blade of grass. A few undulating hills stretched from afar to the seaside, like a few seals drinking water.</p>
<p>We picked up some ice chips and tasted them. The taste was bitter and salty. Indeed, it is China's largest inland saltwater lake, with a circumference of over six hundred li and an area of one thousand six hundred square li. According to the Tibetans who circle the sea to pray, it takes sixteen days to circle it once.</p>
<p>This place is more than two stops away from the frequently visited Chahan City. It is necessary to cross a mountain ridge to the south, so few tourists have set foot on the Ximala Bu beach.</p>
<p>In the telescope, we discovered two shadowy shapes of the Sea Center Mountain. In the center of the sea and sky, they looked like two small boats. According to the guide, there are many lamas and jomies (female nuns) on the mountain who sit and practice in wells. The mountain produces some cattle and sheep, but not crops, so every year when it freezes in the cold winter, they drive their cattle and sheep ashore to exchange for a year's worth of grain. The period for them to go ashore is mostly in the third nine-day period (twenty-seven days after the winter solstice), otherwise, outside of the severe cold, the vast ice slope is very prone to cracking.</p>
<p>Qinghai's Mongolian name is "Kokonor", and its Tibetan name is "Tsongonpo". Koko and Tso are translations of blue, and Nor and Gonpo are translations of sea. Qinghai is originally an inland lake, so in Chinese it should be written as "Qinghu".</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Qingdao Fishing Villages</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhichao</p>
<p>Qingdao juts out into the sea, straddling the Yellow and Bohai Seas, and encompasses Jiaozhou Bay, a natural harbor. It is the geographical environment that dictates the livelihood of the people there, which is primarily fishing. Before the opening of the commercial port, there were already more than 160 fishing villages. Among them, Shazikou District had more than 20 fishing villages, the southern part of Zhangcun District had eight or nine villages, Taitung District had more than 20 villages, Sifang District had more than 30 villages, the western part of Xianjiasai District had more than 10 villages, and the entire Haixi District had more than 70 villages. In each village, fishing households accounted for more than 70%, with farming households being in the minority. This illustrates the importance of fishing for the coastal residents of Qingdao.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, according to a Japanese survey, Yin Island alone had 330 fishing boats, more than 1,300 fishermen, and annual catches valued at 25,000 yuan. Shazikou had 300 fishing boats, more than 1,200 fishermen, and annual catches valued at 100,000 yuan. Smaller fishing villages were not included in the statistics. In 1926, according to a survey report by the Fisheries and Navigation Bureau, the Qingdao area had more than 1,400 fishing boats and 11,000 fishermen. Later, the Japanese organized a fisheries association in Qingdao, which more than 9,200 Chinese fishermen joined. The fishing areas, inside the bay, were based on Yin Island, and in the open sea, they centered on Shazikou Jianggezhuang, extending eastward beyond Bachidun to the Thousand Islands, and southward to Talian Island and Shuiling Mountain Island, as well as Shidao and other places within Laoshan Bay.</p>
<p>The fishing methods of the coastal residents were very traditional, without any improvement. It was not until Germany occupied Jiaozhou Bay and Britain occupied Weihaiwei that the fishing industry began to attract attention. In 1914, the Japanese forcibly occupied Qingdao and frequently had fishing vessels stationed in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, fishing at will. At the same time, the Japanese government also provided many conveniences and encouragement, so that in the most prosperous period, the number of Japanese fishing boats in Qingdao increased from 108 to 130, and the number of fishermen also increased significantly. The Japanese established a fisheries association in Qingdao, handling loans, sales, and many other matters, so that the fishing industry of Qingdao was completely controlled by the Japanese. After 1927, the Bohai Fleet was stationed in Qingdao, patrolling and protecting the area, and maintaining maritime rights. At the same time, the Qingdao Municipal Social Bureau also made great efforts to promote and encourage wealthy merchants in Qingdao to organize the Qingdao Fisheries Company, specializing in all transactions of aquatic products. However, all of this could not compete with the strong influence of the Japanese fisheries association in Qingdao. Currently, the high-grade fish (which is a high-quality food, valued at five or six jiao per jin) that occupy an important sales market along the coast of Qingdao, although produced in large quantities and with fresh fish available for sale in all seasons, are mostly caught by the Japanese. During the fishing season in spring and autumn, the Japanese use large sailing ships or steamships to catch fish in the Haizhou area, while smaller boats travel to Shuiling Mountain Island, Daxiaogong Island, Talian Island, and the Thousand Islands area. Even in winter, when fish are scarce, small boats are scattered in the southern part of Talian Island to catch fish. A large sailing ship can earn more than 7,000 yuan per year, while a small boat can earn more than 2,000 yuan. The catches of Chinese fishing boats cannot compare to theirs. The fishing tools used by the Japanese include line fishing, cast nets, lift nets, drift nets, diving equipment, etc. In addition to the high-grade fish, the fish caught include sharks, flatfish, conger eels, croakers, abalone, fish wheat, and seaweed. As for transportation and sales, it is entirely monopolized by the Qingdao Fisheries Company and the Qingdao Fisheries Association organized by the Japanese. A fish market is set up in Qingdao, and all transportation and sales of aquatic products must first go through the fish market. The organizers of the fish market are all brokers of the Fisheries Company or the Fisheries Association. At the fish market, various types of fish products are purchased through bidding, and then transported and sold to other places. There are 34 fish companies in Qingdao, including Yichengxiang and Fuxingyu. The total annual turnover is more than 3 million yuan, and the income from commissions alone is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese fisheries have been carrying out aggression in a more planned way. They use scientific methods to catch fish, making it impossible for the fishing households along the coast of Qingdao to resist. Moreover, last May's hurricane caused most of the fishermen's nets to be lost, leading to the bankruptcy of the fishing industry and turning fishermen into disaster victims, suffering from hunger and cold. Fishing boats must obtain a license to fish. Fishing households without money to obtain a license can only miss the opportunity to fish. Some fishing households who have been able to support themselves in recent years have only one way out: debt. Needless to say, the creditors are the fish companies. These fish company brokers, relying on the power of their masters, oppress the fishers who work hard all year round but cannot get enough to eat or wear, making them unable to breathe. However, the general fish companies that are accustomed to using large scales to buy fish or heavily exploiting the fishers have also found themselves at a dead end in recent years. They did not expect that this recession was caused by someone behind the scenes, so they only know to heavily oppress the fishers and squeeze out every drop of their sweat and blood. The current situation is even more serious. Not only have the fishing households themselves declared bankruptcy one after another, but seven or eight out of ten fish companies along the coast have also closed down. In the past, coastal fishing households could still borrow money to survive, but now even that avenue is blocked.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the fishermen. Fishermen are also called "shaoshui." In addition to wages, each person carries five or six nets, called "shaoguazi," and only takes the fishing profits, without sharing expenses. This is a method of encouraging fishermen. A "shaoshui" person only receives a salary of ten yuan per season. Five or six years ago, the salary of each "shaoshui" person was around thirty yuan, and together with the fishing income from the "shaoguazi," it was around one hundred and fifty yuan. A family could barely make ends meet. Now the salary is only ten yuan, and the "shaoguazi" provided by oneself not only has no income, but there is also the risk of losing them. The "shaoguazi" are mostly owned by the fishermen themselves through debt, and the fishing income obtained cannot even pay off the interest on the debt. The fishermen are really crying out in pain!</p>
<p>The work of ordinary women in the autumn and winter seasons is always "netting," winding thread, twisting thread, wrapping thread, and putting thread on the shuttle. Adults and children are all busy, so their slogan is "busy netting day and night." Some knit "shougong" (that is, knit for others, only earning manual labor wages); some knit "ben" (that is, buy thread with their own capital to knit), and sell them after knitting, priced by the jin. The average price is eight jiao per jin. Each net weighs fifteen jin and requires two cotton yarns (locally known as foreign thread). The value of two cotton yarns is nine yuan, so each net has a profit of three yuan. Usually, in the autumn and winter seasons, each person can knit four nets, which can generate an income of more than ten yuan. Knitting "shougong" can earn two yuan per net. This is the only side job production for women here besides washing clothes and cooking. Four or five years ago, the profit of each net was as much as seven or eight yuan, but now it is less than half of that, and sales are much worse than before. The main business is bankrupt, affecting the side business, which is of course to be expected.</p>
<p>In this era, whether fishermen or fishing workers, they are all encountering a tragic fate. All capital is lost, and debts are high. The arable land is originally very small, and they cannot engage in other production, and the food they eat must be purchased, which is truly a dead end. Generally, fishing households with a little bit of fishing gear maintain their fishing business, but are also bound by the salt problem. Even if they catch a little more fish, they have nowhere to buy salt, and they have no money to buy salt. This is truly "when it rains, it pours, and when the boat sails, it encounters headwinds." Fishermen pay a fish tax of three jiao for every hundred jin of fish, and then hold a license to distribute salt, estimating the amount of fish according to the size of the boat, with each hundred jin receiving twenty jin of salt. The fishermen don't understand anything, so they publicly elect an escort to be responsible for receiving salt and selling fish. The fish caught by the fishermen who have no money to buy salt can only be allowed to rot, which is a tragic fate. Many fishing villages, because they really have no way to make a living, request the county government to issue passports to escape the famine, but the county government does not allow it. But a group of young and strong people, unwilling to starve to death, quietly leave their hometowns and seek other ways out.</p>

<p>Foreign Consulates Send Condolences</p>
<p>After the news of President Hu's death spread, it shocked China and foreign countries. In addition to the condolence messages from the central government and various provinces that have been published in Shanghai and Guangdong newspapers, the consuls of various countries stationed in Guangzhou also sent condolence messages one after another, and lowered their flags at half-mast at their consulates to express their condolences. Excerpts from the condolence messages from the British and German consuls in Guangzhou are as follows: British Consul Fiberley's letter: "I have just received your letter and am shocked to learn of the sad news of the death of President Hu Hanmin. The mountain has collapsed and the tree has decayed. I am deeply saddened. The encoffining ceremony will be held today, and my colleagues and I should have attended to pay our respects in person. However, due to the suddenness of the event, we were unable to make arrangements to attend together. We are deeply apologetic. We will arrange a time to visit the spirit tablet in person to express our condolences." German Consul Adenberg's letter: "Yesterday, I received your letter and was shocked to learn that Mr. Hu Hanmin, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of your country, passed away due to illness at 7:00 PM on the 12th of this month. As the Consul-General, I am deeply saddened by the news. In addition to lowering the flag at half-mast to express my condolences, I am sending this letter to express my condolences and sympathy." In addition, American Consul Spark, Japanese Consul Tatsuo Kawai, French Consul Erland, Swiss Consul Balinger, Dutch Consul Weling, Czech Consul Le Lau De, and Finnish Consul, all sent letters of condolence to Hu's family.</p>
<h3>Dagu Fort is Transformed into Bohai Park</h3>
<p>Construction is Currently Underway and Will Open in About Two Months; Cao Kun's Former Residence Will Also Be Transformed into a Municipal Park</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Dagu Port, known as the gateway to Northern China and a strategically important military location in the Bohai Sea, has had its eastern and western forts destroyed by the Eight-Nation Alliance during the Boxer Rebellion. For more than 30 years, the gateway has been wide open, and the inner depths have been exposed. Every time ships pass through here, seeing the ruins standing, they cannot help but sigh. Today, the situation in North China is precarious and shocking, which makes people think about the importance of strategic locations and the need to repair them as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, the Tianjin Municipal Government has recently paid attention to these ruins, believing that Tianjin is a major city in North China and Dagu Port is a vital transportation route for maritime transport. Since the city of Tianjin has been actively renovated, this place must also be decorated. However, due to treaty limitations, the forts cannot be rebuilt, so the ruins will be used to create a park. The summer heat can be escaped here, and in the pleasant days of spring and autumn, it can be a place for outings. When Xiao Zhenying inspected the Tianjin-Dagu highway, he also inspected the area twice and found that Tianjin is full of dust and noise. When summer comes, there is no place to wash away the worries and feel comfortable. If Dagu Port is built into a park, with a little artificial decoration, it will add a tourist and summer resort, which is also an important plan for the health and hygiene of the citizens. The Municipal Works Bureau was ordered to make a plan and start construction as soon as possible, and the project must be completed within two months. The project mainly involves rebuilding the original sites of the eastern and western forts of Dagu Port into two seaside pavilions, with vermilion beams and columns and covered with yellow and green glazed tiles. Each pavilion costs about 15,000 yuan. After they are built, visitors can climb the pavilions and see the vast sea and the sails of the ships. When the tide comes, although it is not as spectacular as watching the tide in Haining, it can still provide a great view of the surging waves. In addition, the original site of the Port Authority will be rebuilt into a hotel, a small number of houses, or a sanatorium for lung diseases. Pine, elm, cypress, and willow trees will be planted within five li of the forts, and small paths will be paved with sand and stones. The eastern and western forts are opposite each other across the Haihe River. Transportation will be by sampan. In the future, transportation to Tianjin will be by bus, with the Municipal Government purchasing several buses to operate exclusively, making four round trips a day. Police officers will be dispatched along the way to provide protection, following the Tianjin-Dagu highway. Water transportation will be along the Haihe River. The Municipal Government will also purchase two public motorboats. Tourists can choose to travel by boat or car at will, returning in the evening, which is very convenient. The park is named "Bohai." The construction has already begun. The Municipal Works Bureau sent many tree branches last week. With the consent of Liu Zhen, brigade commander of the 29th Army, Xiao Zhenying arranged for a regiment of soldiers to go to the construction site to level the roads and plant trees. With everyone working together, the progress is quite fast. According to the regulations of the Municipal Government, about 100,000 yuan will be used for this construction. In two or three years, it may become the only scenic spot in North China.</p>
<p>Cao Kun's old residence, located at the west entrance of Huangwei Road in Hebei, Tianjin, is a magnificent mansion with a vast area. When Cao Kun was at his peak, he lived here. The name of Cao Kun's Garden was once famous throughout the country. The Northern Warlords also used this place as a place to discuss the current situation and decide the fate of the country. After Cao Kun lost power, it was repeatedly borrowed by the military, and the buildings were damaged at will. Those who knew about it often felt the sadness of the Wang and Xie families. After Xiao Zhenying became mayor, he realized that Tianjin had no grand parks and the citizens had no place for recreation. Therefore, he purchased it from Cao Kun for 100,000 yuan and transformed it into the first municipal park. Construction has been underway for two months. It was originally planned to be completed in May. Later, the Tianjin education community requested the Municipal Government to build a swimming pool in the park because Tianjin lacked one. Xiao then allocated 20,000 yuan to build it. It will be completely completed in about 40 days, and it will be opened at that time. The artificial mountains, trees, pavilions, ponds, and swamps in the garden are all old. Only the painting and decoration work has been added. The old theater building will be contracted to a Peking opera troupe to perform when it opens. The Chinese restaurant is contracted to Fengzeyuan, and the Western restaurant is contracted to the National Hotel. The tea pavilion and游boats are also sent out separately. Cao Kun's ancestral hall, located in the back garden, will be changed to worship Confucius. The two Tianjin buildings, one used to be Cao Kun's public office and the other was his private residence, have been renovated and will be used as public banquet halls and municipal government guesthouses. This, together with the opening of Bohai Park, is a new initiative of the Tianjin municipal government. (16th)</p>
<h3>Tax Inspection Offices Established Along the Coast of Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Managed by the Provincial Tax Inspection Office; Each Branch Office Has Troops to Strictly Combat Smuggling</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Recently, the trend of smuggling has been rampant in the coastal areas of Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen. This is because the area is located across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan, with the narrowest point being only 70 miles away. Moreover, the coastlines of Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen are diverse, and landings can be made almost anywhere, making it very difficult to crack down on smuggling at sea. Although the Customs has dispatched many anti-smuggling ships to patrol the coastal areas, very few cases have been solved. The smugglers can cross the sea and land before the anti-smuggling personnel can even start tracking them. To this end, the Provincial Government has specially established the "Provincial Tax Investigation Office," appointing Xia Sheng as the director, and is actively preparing to formally establish it by the end of this month. "Tax Inspection Branch Offices" will also be established in key coastal areas. On the 15th, the appointment of the heads of the branch offices was announced. Huang Bolin of Jiangkou, Cai Jianlian of Jiaowei, Jiang Lianru of Chongwu, Zhang Guogan of Shishi, Qiao Yunjun of Aotou, Zhang Kaiyao, Qiu Bingru of Jiangdongqiao, Hu Zishen of Jinmen, and Wang Xinpan of Jiuzhen have been appointed. Among them, Chongwu is in Hui'an, Shishi is in Jinjiang, Shitou is in Nan'an, Aotou is in Tongan, Jiangdongqiao is in Longxi, at the mouth of the Jiulong River, Jinmen is outside the port of Xiamen, and Jiuzhen is in Zhangpu. These are all the central points of the most rampant smuggling areas along the coast of southern Fujian. Each inspection office has troops under its jurisdiction. Their tasks are to rectify taxation, increase provincial revenue, assist national tax authorities in combating smuggling, and indirectly increase national tax revenue. In the future, smuggling along the coast of southern Fujian may be curbed somewhat. (May 17th)</p>
<h3>The Investigation of Yang Lian and Zhu Tinghu's Impeachment</h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: It has come to light that Education Director Yang Lian and Zhu Tinghu, previously impeached by the Supervisory Yuan, also offered defenses in the case. A summary follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Accusation</p>
<p>Education in Anhui was inherently complex. Zhu Tinghu's slight reorganization of several schools in northern Anhui immediately caused significant disputes. Yang Lian, upon assuming the position of Education Director of Anhui in June of the 20th year, prioritized rectifying academic conduct and eliminating factionalism. Over the summer and winter seasons of subsequent years, he replaced numerous principal personnel, thoroughly reorganizing various educational institutions. Those who praised him recognized that educational administration was disciplined and orderly, and academic conduct was pure and good, unprecedented in Anhui's educational history for ten years. However, those who were disappointed inevitably harbored resentment and created rumors, resorting to slander and injury. Consequently, individuals such as Wang Guanwu and Zhao Zishan, fabricating reports of embezzling public funds, filed complaints with the Supervisory Yuan. After the Yuan ordered the Auditing Department to investigate, according to the investigation report by Inspector Wang Hengjian of that department, Supervisory Committee members Chang Wang and Guangqing initiated impeachment proceedings, requesting that Yang Lian and Zhu Tinghu be jointly referred for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Yang Lian's Defense</p>
<p>Yang Lian's defense stated, "As Director, I am constantly occupied with official duties. The accounting and auditing of books, as well as store transactions, are typically handled separately by accounting and general affairs personnel. The procedure for reviewing accounting and general affairs is for the secretary to first verify the accuracy before submitting it to the Director for approval. In this case, a memorandum was signed by accounting staff member Si Pu, stating, 'Your Excellency took over the Education Department on June 1, 22nd year. In October of the 23rd year, various departments and offices of the provincial government implemented joint office operations, and the accounting and general affairs of this department were merged into the provincial government secretariat for unified handling. When Committee Member Wang Hengjian investigated the province, the reimbursement reports of this department only reached August of the 23rd year. What this department should clarify pertains to the regular expenses for fifteen months. After the settlement of the regular expenses for the first month of my tenure, it was discovered that it exceeded three hundred yuan, and the actual expenditures for various items did not match the budgeted amounts. I then submitted a memorandum to the secretariat for instructions. The secretariat responded with a note (examine the laws and precedents of various agencies, and propose a method for review). After investigation, it was found that when various agencies had insufficient total funds, they had to make up for it themselves. As for items with actual expenditures exceeding the budgeted amounts too much, the excess could not be reported. Items with actual expenditures not exceeding the budgeted amounts were often reported according to the budgeted amounts, using the overreported amounts to make up for the amounts that could not be reported. The secretary's office instructed, "The expenses of this department must be truly spent and reported, ensuring that income and expenses are balanced, and every penny is used for public benefit. If there is any surplus, it should be immediately turned over to the treasury or accumulated and handed over to the successor." The daily journal of this department listed the overreported amounts each month as excess revenue, and the unreported amounts were stamped with the words "unreported." The discrepancy between excess revenue and unreported expenses is obvious. As for the unreported amounts, there are receipts. If there are any errors, I am willing to bear all responsibility," etc. He also attached a copy of the daily journal, a book of unreported receipts, a statement of income and expenses, and two signed memoranda. As for the five temporary events handled, he also instructed the responsible personnel to submit separate explanations. He presented this to the Disciplinary Committee. The truth of the matter is that the handling personnel, Si Pu, were unfamiliar with accounting laws and regulations. For the transfer of surplus funds, he only followed precedents and did not follow legal procedures, failing to submit a special report to the superior authorities for approval and filing in advance. The chief secretary also believed that this was the precedent and neglected the reporting procedures, failing to request instructions from the supervisor until this case occurred. The supervisor had not yet noticed it. The Disciplinary Committee, after reviewing the unreported receipts, accounting daily journal, and income and expenses statement for fifteen months, verified that the claimed overreported amounts were to make up for the unreported deficits, and that the five temporary events handled were reported by the respective accounting staff, all of which were factual. However, the person subject to disciplinary action, as the supervisor, should have executed the budget as determined for the department's expenses, verified actual expenditures, and filed reports according to law. If a certain item was insufficient and another had a surplus, it should have been reported for approval in accordance with budgetary regulations before being transferred. However, he transferred surplus funds without authorization, which was improper. Although the circumstances differ from the original impeachment allegation of embezzling public funds, he cannot avoid the legal responsibility for violation of the disciplinary law. Therefore, Yang Lian should be given a demerit."</p>
<p>Zhu Tinghu's Defense</p>
<p>Zhu Tinghu's defense stated, "The purchase of items within the department was generally managed by general affairs, who obtained funds from accounting based on purchase receipts. All fund requisition receipts were submitted to Chief Secretary Jiang Naimin for approval. At the time, the entries in the verification book showed that all payments matched the receipts, indicating that public funds had been paid according to the receipts. Furthermore, former General Affairs Officer Cao Bingxiang stated, 'Usually, items such as stationery were purchased and recorded in a ledger together, and then the goods were taken. At the end of the month, when the general affairs office received the requisition receipts from various stores, they were sent to the secretariat for review together with the original store ledgers, and then handed over to the accounting office to issue cash. All the receipts handled at Luoyanglou are genuine, and there is absolutely no fraudulent activity. I will bear legal responsibility for this.' I, Tinghu, was previously in Anhui Province and, due to my limited talent and heavy workload, did not have time to personally handle internal affairs. The chief secretary also died due to old age and illness, making it even more difficult to recall the situation at the time." The Disciplinary Committee's review concluded that Zhu's income and expenditure statements were found to be consistent. However, as the head of the department, the person subject to disciplinary action should have strictly supervised the accounting and general affairs personnel, and should have reviewed all expenditures. However, he entrusted all matters to subordinates, resulting in discrepancies between the actual payments and the reimbursement receipts, which he did not notice at the time. Although the circumstances do not suggest any collusion in fraudulent activities, he cannot avoid the responsibility for dereliction of duty. Therefore, Zhu Tinghu should be given a reprimand.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Ban on Permanent Waves is Resolved</p>
<p>When the New Life Movement General Inspection Team inspected Suzhou last month, they noted that women using electric hair curling was not only extremely dangerous but also contrary to the New Life Movement. The Public Security Bureau dispatched police to seal all electric hair curling equipment in Suzhou's barber shops, causing panic among over a thousand barbers. The barbers' association repeatedly petitioned Party and government authorities and issued declarations, requesting that the curling irons be preserved to maintain the livelihood of the workers and that the sealed equipment be unsealed and returned for sale. The county Party headquarters rejected the preservation of curling irons. Consequently, the industry devised three new styles of women's permanent waves, in which previously curled hair could still be straightened with curling irons. After submitting this to the county Party headquarters for approval, the county Party headquarters approved it, with the condition that curling irons could be used to straighten hair for a maximum of eight months, to prevent pretexts and maintain the New Life Movement. This has been implemented since yesterday. After a few more days, the hair of women in Suzhou will likely transform into the latest style of short hair.</p>

It lasted for about ten minutes before stopping.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou-Pinghu Seawall is Repaired</p>
<p>The spring tides this year are particularly large, and the Zhejiang West seawall is showing signs of danger. The Fuzihao dike in the Hangzhou-Pinghu section had its altar stones washed away by huge waves. The Jian De County magistrate ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to rush to repair it. The stone dikes of Feigong and other characters that were washed away have been repaired by the dike engineering team. The daily tidal range is small, and there is probably no immediate danger of recurrence.</p>
<p>The Court Investigates a Murder Without a Head</p>
<p>Chen Yin, the Superintendent of Minzhe, said that there was a ghost at Anhua Station, who had fallen to his death in a railway fire. The court had verified the coffin and made arrangements. However, near the coffin was a group of people playing with flowers, praying for dreams. The ghost appeared in a dream, saying that he had been murdered and asked for help. Every prediction made to the flower association came true. Chen recognized that there was a hidden truth and ordered the Zhuji County Court to investigate. As the corpse's flesh had decayed, the bones were sent to the Zhenqie Chemical Examination Institute for examination. The examination revealed three injuries from blunt and sharp metal objects on the head, clearly indicating murder. The Zhuji County Court is now studying the entire case and devising ways to arrest the murderer for legal punishment.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Western Anhui Appeals for Tea Tax Reduction</p>
<p>Western Anhui produces tea, with Huoshan being the most famous. The economic source relies on it. In recent years, banditry has been rampant, and tea production has been greatly affected. Even the sales markets in Ji and Lu have plummeted. The county chamber of commerce stated that the Anhui West Tea Tax Collection Bureau has often illegally overcharged tea taxes over the years. For example, each basket of exported tea, with the skin removed, weighs about eleven catties and twelve taels in market weight. Based on the spring tea capital, each basket is only worth about three yuan. According to the Ministry's regulations, only four cents and five li can be taxed. However, the tea tax bureaus in previous years have arbitrarily estimated the tea price and doubled the tax collection. Even last year, in addition to taxing spring tea baskets at 60% of the official tax, they also limited the market weight to ten catties per basket, adding an additional one cent and five li for the odd one catty and twelve taels of spring tea per basket. Thus, the additional tax per basket exceeded the Ministry's prescribed tax rate principle. Moreover, the Huaiyuan Registration Office made things difficult in various ways, using excuses to levy additional taxes, which made tea merchants hesitant and unwilling to proceed. Therefore, it has jointly telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government and the Department of Finance to appeal for compliance with the Ministry's regulations, reduction of tax rates, and instructions to various tea tax bureaus to abolish additional excessive taxes and prohibit registration demands, in order to facilitate sales and improve people's livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Chemistry Lecture Series 2: Applications of Chemistry (4)</h3>
<p>— Chen Kezhong, Full-time Translator, National Compilation and Translation Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the Problem of Poison Gas: Poison gas warfare only appeared during the European War. In 1915, Germany first used it on a large scale and defeated the Allied forces. After that, various countries competed to use various gases as weapons to attack the enemy. By the end of the European War, dozens of kinds of poison gas had been invented. After the war, various countries continued to work hard to research them. In the past twenty years, various countries have invented even more and more powerful poison gases. Although there are many kinds of poison gas, their nature and use can be divided into the following five categories:</p>
<p>Lachrymatory Gas: The main lachrymatory gases are mostly bromine compounds, such as Bromoacetone. This type of gas can stimulate the mucous membranes of the eyes, causing pain and tearing. Some can also cause coughing and a runny nose.</p>
<p>Sternutatory Gas: The main gases of this type are organic arsenic compounds, such as Diphenylchloroarsine. Poisoning with this gas can irritate the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, causing sneezing, coughing, tearing, vomiting, headaches, and other symptoms.</p>
<p>Asphyxiant Gas: The main gases of this type are compounds of chlorine and phosgene. They can damage the trachea and lungs. Therefore, poisoning often causes difficulty breathing, paleness, and in severe cases, paralysis of the heart, inflammation of the trachea, pulmonary edema, and death.</p>
<p>Vesicant Gas: The main gas of this type is mustard gas. The ability of mustard gas compounds to harm humans is extremely powerful. If the skin anywhere on the body comes into contact with it, it will rot. Therefore, even using a gas mask cannot defend against this type of gas. One must use an airtight protective suit to protect the entire body in order to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Poisoning Gas: The main gases of this type are compounds of cyanide, such as hydrogen cyanide. Other gases such as carbon monoxide are also types of poisoning gas. The toxicity of this type of gas is considered the most severe. Even inhaling a small amount can be fatal because they can directly poison the nerves and prevent blood oxidation. Therefore, death occurs quickly after poisoning. However, this type of gas is very inconvenient to use because it is easy to volatilize and dissipate.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also two types of agents: incendiary and smoke-producing. The main incendiary agents are white phosphorus and thermite. White phosphorus mixed with oil burns very quickly. Thermite is a mixture of iron oxide and aluminum powder. It can generate high temperatures when burning, and even steel will melt when it encounters it, so it is considered the most powerful incendiary agent. The main materials for generating smoke are phosphorus and tin tetrachloride. Phosphorus can produce phosphorus pentoxide smoke after burning. Tin tetrachloride is a liquid that, when sprayed into the air with ammonia, immediately turns into thick white smoke, which has a great ability to conceal.</p>
<p>From the above, we know that the effectiveness of poison gas in war is very great. In future wars, the use of poison gas is unavoidable. So, on the eve of this looming disaster, how should we prepare? This is something that deserves our deep consideration. The relationship between poison gas manufacturing and the chemical industry is very close, especially with the dye industry. The procedures for manufacturing poison gas and manufacturing dyes have many similarities. Ordinary dye factories can be quickly converted into poison gas manufacturing plants during wartime. My country's dye industry has no foundation, so the manufacturing of poison gas is naturally very difficult. The source of chlorine relies entirely on the electrolysis industry of table salt. This type of industry already exists in Shanghai, and there will be a need to expand and increase it in the future. Other substances, such as cyanide, are essential medicines for ordinary medicine, and arsenide is also a commonly used insecticide in agriculture. Germany is the country with the most developed chemical industry, so its poison gas manufacturing is also superior to others. If my country wants to prepare in terms of poison gas, it must first actively promote the chemical industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the Problem of Liquid Fuel: Liquid fuel is also very important in modern warfare. Whether it is airplanes in the air, cars and tanks on the ground, or transport vehicles, they all rely on liquid fuel to operate. For example, recently Italy has been preparing meticulously to fight Abyssinia. Countries around the world have tried various methods of sanctions, but none have been effective. According to experts, only cutting off the supply of liquid fuel can subdue Italy. From this, we can know the value of liquid fuel in national defense. The country with the most oil production in the world is the United States, followed by Soviet Russia. My country's oil production is very small. Now, a table of the oil production of various countries in the world (1933) is listed below:</p>
<p>Oil</p>
<p>China 453 (tons)</p>
<p>United States 122,795,018</p>
<p>Germany 232,689</p>
<p>France 85,000</p>
<p>Italy 26,000</p>
<p>Russia 21,440,000</p>
<p>Japan 334,286</p>
<p>In the past two years, the average annual import of liquid fuel into my country has been more than 40 million yuan. Once the country is in trouble and the seaports are blockaded, even if we have weapons, we will not be able to use them. Therefore, how to solve the problem of liquid fuel is very important. Since my country's oil reserves are not abundant and relying on others is extremely dangerous, the only way to solve the problem of liquid fuel is to rely on the efforts of chemists. This problem can be roughly divided into three aspects to study. First, extract oil from oil shale using distillation. It is said that Guangdong, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces have good prospects. Second, use coal to produce oil through low-temperature distillation or hydrogenation. Third, use vegetable oil for decomposition and distillation. Regarding the low-temperature distillation of oil shale and coal, the Fuel Research Laboratory of the Geological Survey of the Ministry of Industry is currently working hard on research. Regarding the decomposition of vegetable oil, the Central Industrial Experimental Institute, Central University, and Guangdong Industrial Experimental Institute are all conducting research. According to experts, among these three sources, if the results of the first type of survey are satisfactory, it will of course be the best, followed by the second type, and then the third type. This is because the value of the raw materials for decomposing vegetable oil is higher than the products produced, which is very uneconomical in ordinary times. However, my country produces a lot of vegetable oil. If the country is in an emergency, then for the sake of national defense, we can only produce it in large quantities, and we will certainly not be able to consider the question of whether it is economical or not.</p>
<p>From the various issues discussed above, we know that a country relies on chemistry to utilize resources in peacetime and relies on chemistry to supply all weapons in wartime. If we do not pay much attention to the chemical industry in peacetime, then we will have the pain of being unable to cope in wartime. In short, if we want to fight for the survival of our nation, the chemical industry should be actively promoted first. (End)</p>

Philippine President Quezon saw Mr. Murphy off in Hong Kong and then changed ships to return to the Philippines, without coming along. The ship was anchored in the Yangshupu River, and Chinese and American parties boarded special yachts to warmly welcome him. The welcoming party included Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, representing Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, Tang Shixuan, Secretary of the Municipal Government, representing Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Admiral Ma Fen, Commander of the US Far East Fleet, Gauss, Consul General in Shanghai, Steve, Manager of the Dollar Steamship Company, and Mills, representative of the United Press, and many others.</p>
<p>Reception in Shanghai and Return to Ship in the Evening</p>
<p>After Mr. Murphy exchanged greetings with the welcoming party on the ship, he and Admiral Ma Fen transferred to a US Navy boat, landed on the Bund on Nanjing Road, and went to the Columbia Country Club in Shanghai's Columbia Road to attend a luncheon hosted by US Consul General Gauss. At 4:00 PM, Xu Jianping, representative of Minister Kong, held a tea party at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to welcome Mr. Murphy. Mr. Murphy only made a half-day stopover in Shanghai and returned to the ship that evening, departing from Shanghai at 6:45 AM this morning to return to the US.</p>
<p>Interview with Reporters and Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy gave an interview to Chinese and foreign reporters in his cabin on the ship. He first stated that his decision to return to the US was to discuss several important matters with the Washington authorities regarding the Philippines, such as the issue of Japanese occupying Davao in Mindanao. He then discussed the trade and economic issues of the Philippines since independence, which have become more important than before, but the situation is progressing. He also mentioned that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are in a friendly position in Philippine commerce and there is no discord. He continued that a US-Philippine trade conference would be held in early next year and hopes to have preliminary talks in September or October of this year. He is very satisfied with everything in the Philippines and said that President Quezon is a statesman and very capable. The compilation of the Philippine National Defense Force is actively underway under the guidance of General Douglas MacArthur. Mr. Murphy finally expressed that the Philippines holds a friendly attitude towards any country and anyone who does not want to contend with others is their friend. He plans to return to the Philippines in October this fall and his duties will be handled by J. Weldon Jones during his absence.</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that Mr. Murphy, the US Resident Commissioner to the Philippines, departed from Manila on the President Coolidge with his entourage and arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 18th). A reporter from the Da Mei Evening News boarded the ship for an interview. According to Mr. Murphy, his decision to return to the US was to confer with the Washington authorities on several Philippine affairs that needed to be discussed as soon as possible, one of which was the issue of Japanese leasing land around Davao in Mindanao. The Japanese occupy a fixed position in agriculture and commerce in the area, which is a matter that should be discussed. There are several other more important issues, one of which is the general state of commerce. The US should formulate a plan for this, which he has been paying close attention to recently. Regarding the prediction of a reporter from the Associated Press that the Philippine independence movement would certainly fail, he did not agree. He believes that independence is what the Filipinos want and there is no sign of change in the way they conduct their affairs. He believes that commercial and economic issues are now more serious than before, but today there is a gradual trend towards pragmatism, which is not regrettable. The Chinese who trade in the Philippines are extremely friendly with the Filipinos, and there is no conflict between them. As for the dispute over the Japanese concession in Davao, the entire matter is being handled by the Philippine government and a resolution satisfactory to all parties will soon be reached, without the unexpected twists and turns expected by outsiders. Before departing from Manila, the Philippine government gave him a detailed report on the case for investigation, which he will present to the authorities in Washington for review. The future US-Philippine commercial conference will be convened in Manila in early 1937, with 300 to 400 delegates. Talks will be held first in September and October of this year. After arriving in the US, he plans to discuss the matter with the State Department. The compilation of the new Philippine army is now being carried out under the guidance of General MacArthur. He does not believe that a certain foreign country will invade the Philippines. He believes that if one nation on earth has no enmity towards another nation and only seeks to manage its future according to its own wishes, that is the Philippine nation. They now have ideal good neighbors and friends. Murphy declined to explain the reason for the Philippines' implementation of conscription, but said that the Moro tribal resistance problem can now be resolved properly. As for the impact of the change in the Philippine political system on American commerce, it is not yet predictable, but everything looks good and Americans do not need to worry about it.</p>
<h3>Great Joy in the Silverware Industry After the Revision of Silver Usage Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silverware Industry Association has been petitioning the central government since the Ministry of Finance announced and implemented the second item of the Silver Product Silver Usage Management Regulations on November 4 last year, which stipulated that silver utensils and ornaments should be manufactured with chemical silver as raw material, and if pure silver must be mixed, the pure silver content should not exceed 30%. This limitation is difficult to meet the needs of handicraft manufacturing and will affect the livelihoods of millions of workers. The association has joined with counterparts from various provinces and cities to organize the National Silverware Industry Association and has repeatedly petitioned the central government to amend the second item of the regulations. Now, in order to consider the difficulties of the industry and the livelihoods of silver workers, and to protect the inherent craftsmanship, the Ministry of Finance has officially issued a notice yesterday to amend the silver quantity of silver products, still allowing the original habits to be followed. According to the reporter's inquiry to the silverware industry, the industry expressed extraordinary joy after reading the notice from the Ministry of Finance and thanked the authorities for being able to consider the difficulties of merchants and the livelihoods of workers. It is heard that the industry's livelihood has been regained at this point, and endless disputes have also been eliminated.</p>
<h3>Government Representative Attending the World Games, Dai Jitao, Will Depart Tomorrow Morning; Chinese-German Association and Other Groups Hosted Farewell Banquet Yesterday; Zhu Jiahua and Mayor Wu Also Held Farewell Banquets for Dai; Wang Zhengting Boarded Ship Last Night to Go to the US and Then to Germany</h3>
<p>The 11th World Games are scheduled to be held in Berlin this August. In addition to sending a delegation to participate, China has also appointed Dr. Wang Zhengting as the head of the delegation. The government has also appointed Mr. Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, as the government representative to attend. Mr. Wang boarded the Dollar Steamship Company's President Coolidge last night to depart for the US to attend the Rotary International Convention and then go to Germany to attend the World Games. Mr. Dai is scheduled to board the North German Lloyd ship Nasino tonight to depart directly for Germany. Various parties held farewell banquets last night. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Five Groups Hosted Farewell</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese-German Cultural Association, the Chinese-German-Austrian Alumni Association, Tongji University, the Tongji Alumni Association, and the China Academy hosted a tea banquet yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Huaan Building to bid farewell to Mr. Dai Jitao. The attendees included Dai Jitao, Kong Xiangxi, Zhu Jiahua, Xu Peihuang, Dai Enji, Li Jingcong, Bao Keyong, Weng Zhilong, Li Zhaohuan, Huang Boqiao, Chen Peide, Tan Boying, Ding Wenyuan, and Chinese and foreign guests, totaling over a hundred people. Zhu Jiahua gave an introductory speech, briefly stating that Mr. Dai is a veteran of the Party and the country and a philosopher in our country. His morality and knowledge are admired by both China and foreign countries. His decision to represent the government to attend the World Games in Germany will certainly gain a good impression in that country. Therefore, the various groups have jointly hosted a banquet to express their best wishes. Then, Mr. Dai stood up and gave a speech, briefly stating that China's thousands of years of culture and philosophy are based on the word "conservation." From Shennong and the Yellow Emperor to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, all have focused on treating diseases and people, with peace as the sole purpose. However, treating diseases occurs after the disease has occurred, while physical education can strengthen the body and soul, and its effectiveness is in advance. He feels that he is lacking in talent and knowledge, but he hopes to do his best to investigate and live up to everyone's expectations. Germany is an advanced country in medicine. Medicine protects people, and industry provides for people, which is quite in line with our country's philosophy. Finally, he expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the various groups.</p>
<p>Wu and Zhu Held Banquets</p>
<p>Mayor Wu held a tea party at his private residence on Haige Road yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM to bid farewell to Mr. Dai Jitao and Wang Zhengting and invited leaders from all walks of life to accompany them. Mr. Wang himself boarded the President Coolidge at 11:00 PM last night with his wife, Ms. Shi Meiyun, and others. His friend Liu Yunfang and others went to the port to see him off. The ship set sail at 0:45 AM, and after arriving in the US, he is scheduled to attend the Rotary International Convention on June 22, and then cross the Atlantic to Germany to attend the World Games. Zhu Jiahua, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, hosted a farewell banquet for Mr. Dai at the International Hotel last night at 8:00 PM and invited Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Feipeng, Song Ziliang, Song Zian, Huang Boqiao, and leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to accompany them.</p>
<p>Prepared Ferry to Say Farewell</p>
<p>Mr. Dai and his entourage, Ding Wenyuan and Tan Boyu, counselor of the embassy in Germany, are scheduled to board the ship tonight and set sail tomorrow morning. In addition to personally going to say farewell, Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Li Tingan, Director of the Health Bureau, have specially prepared the No. 6 Municipal Ferry for Mr. Dai and his entourage to take. The ferry is scheduled to dock at the Sanma Road New Customs Wharf at 5:00 PM on the 19th and depart at 6:00 PM sharp. Tea and refreshments will be available on board. All relatives and friends of Mr. Dai and Mr. Tan who wish to say goodbye are welcome to go to participate on time. After the event, the ferry will take the farewell party back to the New Customs Wharf.</p>

<h3>Inspector General of Customs, Frederick Maze, Reports on Smuggling Losses</h3>
<p>Reduction of 30 Million Yuan in Customs Duties; Resulting in Gradual Reduction of Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Inspector General of Customs Sir Frederick Maze reported to the Nanjing government last Saturday that from August 1, 1935, to May 6, 1936, the estimated amount of smuggled goods transported from "Manchukuo" and Dalian to Tianjin East Railway Station was approximately 4,235.7 tons of fine arts and raw silk, 55,115.5 tons of white sugar, 392.2 tons of cigarette paper, 26,023 pieces of piece goods (quality and quantity unknown), and 30,329 pieces of miscellaneous goods (contents unknown), including 12,962 boxes of kerosene and 999 barrels of gasoline. The estimated reduction in customs duties due to smuggling was approximately 30 million yuan. Goods that had been taxed at high rates were stockpiled and could not be sold, so the smuggling of various goods increased daily, including apples, soda water, electrical materials, bicycle parts and tires, automobile tires, alcohol, iron wire mesh, nails, canned food, and a batch of pistols (18 boxes). Therefore, smuggled artificial silk and sugar are now flooding the Chinese market. The ordinary local needs have been overturned, resulting in a gradual reduction in tax revenue at many ports. For example, Tianjin's tax revenue in the previous four months has decreased by about 23%. Unless the Customs Anti-Smuggling Department (which was very effective in North China before it was forced to disarm its patrol boats and other equipment) freely resumes its usual activities, and the anti-smuggling ships on the water and the anti-smuggling teams on land are re-equipped, and unless the railway authorities and customs authorities fully cooperate (that is, stop the transit of smuggled goods), it is merely a fantasy to hope for any progress in resolving the unprecedented serious situation caused by violating the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1898.</p>
<h3>Jiangzhe Spring Cocoon Silver Syndicate Loan Application Period Approaching Deadline</h3>
<p>Total Loan Amount Exceeded Ten Million in Three Locations; Manufacturers Still Notified to Apply According to Law</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Spring Cocoon has begun to enter the market, and various silk manufacturers have already set off to collect cocoons. The loan application for cocoon collection from the Silver Syndicate will be closed as scheduled and will not be extended. The total amount released has exceeded ten million yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silver Syndicate Notice</p>
<p>The Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate sent letters to the silk and cocoon industry associations, stating that in order to benefit cocoon farmers and assist the silk industry, they are handling this year's Spring cocoon collection loan in Jiangzhe Province. All procedures are simple and quick. Manufacturers in Jiangzhe Province who need to borrow funds can contact the Syndicate's general office for handling. A notice has been published. However, the Syndicate fears that the manufacturers may not be fully aware of this, so it is specifically attaching twenty copies of the loan application procedure for your company to forward to the manufacturers in your association.</p>
<p>Deadline as Scheduled</p>
<p>The reporter of the New Voice News Agency inquired at the General Office of the Silver Syndicate yesterday and learned that the application deadline for the Jiangzhe cocoon collection loan will be closed as scheduled, that is, May 20 in Zhejiang and May 25 in Jiangsu. As for the cocoon loan that has been examined and approved by the Shanghai General Office, the total amount is about 500,000 yuan, which are all silk manufacturers who went to various parts of Zhejiang to collect cocoons. The Hangzhou and Wuxi sub-offices are receiving enthusiastic applications for loans to collect cocoons. Although the sub-offices have not yet formally reported, it is heard that the amount has exceeded ten million yuan, especially in Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Silk Manufacturers Go to Zhejiang to Collect Cocoons: Shanghai Silk Factories to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Currently Organizing Machines, with Operations to Begin Next Week; Over Thirty Factories Preparing to Open</p>
<p>Silk factories in the city, due to the approaching maturity of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, have dispatched personnel to various regions over the past two days to collect cocoons. Cocoon markets in Shaoxing, Kanshan, Pengtang, and other places, under the supervision of the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee, started weighing cocoons yesterday. Fresh cocoons are priced at approximately 47-48 cents per catty. Over thirty silk factories in the Nanshi Baotai, Zhabei Meifeng, Jiyu, Jiuji, Dacheng, Hongkou Shuanggong, and other areas have begun organizing workshops and various machines, and purchasing large quantities of anthracite coal, determined to collectively resume operations next week. It is said that the city's silk factory female workers, who have been unemployed for a long time, were particularly delighted to hear this news.</p>
<h3>City Party Headquarters and Others Held Chen Yingshi Memorial Service Yesterday</h3>

<p>Yesterday, the 18th, marked the 20th anniversary of the martyrdom of the late revolutionary Chen Yingshi. The City Party Headquarters held a memorial service yesterday morning, gathering representatives from all sectors to commemorate Mr. Chen's revolutionary achievements and inspire future generations. At the same time, they mourned the passing of the Chairman of the Central Standing Committee. The Lake Society also held a meeting yesterday to commemorate the occasion. The entire city flew flags at half-mast, and military and police authorities in the Chinese Concession were under alert. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>City Party Headquarters Lin Meiyan, City Farmers' Association Yu Zhenhui, General Labor Union Long Peiyun, Chinese Labor Association Lu Yinchu, City Education Association Huang Zaoxiong, City Women's Association Lin Kecong, Accountants Association He Yuanming, Second Special District Citizens' Association Huang Xianggu, French Concession Taxpayers' Association Mao Yun, Cooperative Business Promotion Association Du Mengsen, Baoshan Native Place Association Yu Yaoqiu, National Goods Maintenance Association Wang Zhaolin, and over two hundred representatives from various agencies, organizations, major and minor schools, and district party headquarters. Chairman Lin Meiyan, Recorder Du Mengsen, Master of Ceremonies Zhang Hanyun. After performing the rituals, they observed three minutes of silence in mourning for Chairman Hu Hanmin.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>It stated, "Today is the 20th anniversary of the martyrdom of the late revolutionary Chen Yingshi. Your attendance at the memorial service shows that you should recognize and emulate the greatness of Mr. Chen. The following is a brief account of Mr. Chen's life. 'Childhood': Mr. Chen was born in the 36th year before the Republic of China. He entered school at the age of seven. From a young age, he was brave and chivalrous. He lost his father at the age of ten and later learned a trade. He immediately felt that the political system was corrupt and needed reform. 'Engaging in Business and Joining the Party': Mr. Chen felt that the atmosphere in Hangzhou was closed and difficult to develop, so he came to Shanghai to engage in business in the silk industry, while striving for the revolutionary cause. At this time, the United States banned Chinese laborers from entering the country. Mr. Chen believed that the time for revolution had come, so he went to Changsha to discuss resisting American goods with Mr. Ai Shi. Later, his father went to Japan to study and met the General and joined the Tongmenghui, and was admitted to military academy. After entering military academy, Mr. Chen got along with the General and his comrades, studying revolutionary strategies. He returned to China in less than two years and worked in Shanghai. The Wuchang Uprising of 1911 was the result of Mr. Chen's efforts. 'Failure and Imprisonment': After the failure of the Second Revolution, Yuan Shikai's forces expanded. Therefore, he was promoted to the southwest to carry out activities. Before he left, Yuan Shikai learned that Mr. Chen was in Shanghai and telegraphed the consular corps to detain him. The consuls notified Mr. Chen to take temporary refuge, but Mr. Chen continued to work as usual in Shanghai. Because of the assassination of Zheng Ruicheng, a henchman of Yuan Shikai, Yuan Shikai became even more wary of Mr. Chen. Therefore, he bought someone to approach Mr. Chen, using the mortgage of coal mines as a pretext, and sent assassins to attack him. Unfortunately, Mr. Chen was killed. Looking at Mr. Chen's past life, his great personality, and his integrity, he can be a model for us in every way."</p>
<p>Lake Society Memorial</p>
<p>The Lake Society on Guizhou Road also held a memorial service for the late revolutionary Chen Yingshi yesterday. The venue was set up as the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall. Participants included representatives Wang Shuangyun from the City Party Headquarters, Gu Zhaofen from the City Public Security Bureau, Mao Heyuan from the Ningbo Native Place Association, Huang Zaoxiong from the City Education Association, Wang Xiaolai from the City Chamber of Commerce, Dai Chuanxian, the President of the Examination Yuan, Xu Peihuang, Yang Hu, Wang Yiting, Xu Fu, Lei Zhen, Chu Huiseng, Ye Jiaxing, Pan Gongzhan, Zhu Shaoping, Tao Leqin, and others, totaling over two hundred people. Shen Tianxin presided over the meeting, Dai Chuanxian presided over the sacrifice, and Qian Xinzhi and Yan Junxuan assisted in the sacrifice. After performing the rituals, Yan Junxuan read the memorial text (omitted).</p>

<p>Dai Jitao's Speech</p>
<p>President Dai's speech briefly stated that Mr. Chen's important and glorious deeds throughout his life have been recorded in writing. However, among Mr. Chen's deeds, his assistance to the General in establishing the great revolutionary cause and his contribution to the party and the country are truly admirable and unforgettable to us. Mr. Chen's most important stage was from joining the Tongmenghui until Yuan Shikai's conspiracy to usurp the Republic of China. In summary, it can be divided into three points. Mr. Chen always regarded society as his home, so he loved society with the spirit of loving his home. This is especially well known to the people of Shanghai. Because Mr. Chen loved society, the power of society was Mr. Chen's power. This is the great force that enabled Mr. Chen to create the revolution. Therefore, Mr. Chen was a leader of society. Revolution is the mission that young people should have. The revolutionary power shown by revolutionary patriots in their youth is especially great, so their responsibility is also especially great. Therefore, the revolutionary movement can be called a youth movement, and the youth movement should pay special attention to education. At that time, most revolutionary patriots did not receive formal education, and Mr. Yingshi was one of them. Therefore, Mr. Yingshi paid more attention to education, enabling young people to recognize national responsibility and cultivate young people. Mr. Chen not only initiated the organization of schools and helped the development of schools in his hometown, but also helped social education and the development of other cultural undertakings in Shanghai. Therefore, Mr. Yingshi was also a leader in youth education. We all know that the Three Principles of the People is the doctrine of saving the country. The purpose of the revolution is to save the country. When the country encounters difficulties, we must think of ways to save it, just as when a person is sick, he must seek medical treatment. Mr. Chen devoted his life to saving the country and revolution in order to create a country of, by, and for the people, and especially worked hard on the upper-level organization of the country, namely politics. Therefore, Mr. Chen was a leader in the political organization of the country. Furthermore, Mr. Chen was consistent in his love for the country, his hometown, and his family. In making friends, he was able to learn from others' strengths and use others' weaknesses. In all aspects, he could demonstrate the greatness of Mr. Chen's spirit and career.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaotian's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated, "When we recall Mr. Yingshi's life, we can say that he always stood on the front line of the revolution. In the historical process of the Chinese National Revolution, Mr. Chen fought against the surrounding evil forces every day and every moment. Especially during Yuan Shikai's premeditated attempt to proclaim himself emperor and steal the country, Mr. Chen's lifelong revolutionary enthusiasm and uncompromising spirit were even more evident. In the end, he sacrificed himself for the party and the country. However, does Mr. Chen's death mean Mr. Chen's failure? Brothers believe that Mr. Chen's death is Mr. Chen's success, because the ultimate self-awareness of a revolutionary is sacrifice. Therefore, Mr. Chen sacrificed himself to achieve benevolence, and it was not a failure. However, our party has indeed lost a teacher with a great spirit of fearlessness. Brothers have followed Mr. Chen for a long time and deeply know the greatness of Mr. Chen's revolutionary personality. I believe that Mr. Chen's wisdom, courage, and integrity in maintaining the republic and implementing doctrines against all enemies of the revolution are truly worthy of our admiration and commemoration. Especially today, ten years after Mr. Chen's martyrdom, looking around at the situation of our nation, Mr. Chen's spirit is even more worthy of our emulation and continued struggle and sacrifice. In this way, we will not fail the meaning of commemorating Mr. Chen today." Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan and others gave speeches in succession. Finally, students from Jingxiong Girls' Middle School sang a memorial song and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Alert in the Concessions</p>
<p>In addition to the City Party Headquarters convening representatives from all walks of life to hold ceremonies and the Lake Society holding public sacrifices yesterday, the entire city flew flags at half-mast to show mourning. The City Public Security Bureau and the City Security Corps Headquarters ordered their respective branches, police stations, and security teams to increase their posts and patrols and be on strict alert in order to prevent troublemakers from taking the opportunity to cause chaos. The police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession also ordered their respective police stations to increase patrols and strengthen security. In addition, the Chen Martyr Memorial Stone Tower built on Minquan Road in the Old West Gate was also opened yesterday for one day, allowing people to enter and pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Customs Warning: Sandbar Discovered in Shashi</h3>
<p>Near the Lighters of the Sanbei Company; Yangtze River Vessels Sailing Above Hankou Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Customs has warned all Yangtze River vessels sailing above Hankou to pay attention to the discovery of a sandbar in Shashi Port in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The sandbar warning in Shashi Port states that a sandbar has been discovered near the lighters of the Sanbei Company and the Customs.

<h3>After Tea Merchants Continue to Suspend Exchange, the Marketing Office Seeks Other Sales Methods</h3>
<p>Considers Zheng Jianyuan's Resignation as Intentional Obstruction; Foreign Tea Merchants' Meeting Shows No Opinion</p>
<p>After the Tea Industry Association and the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Office broke down in negotiations, Zheng Jianyuan, the director of the sales team of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Office, sent a letter requesting resignation. Tea merchants continued to suspend the exchange of black tea. Yesterday, the Shenshi News reporter inquired with the Marketing Office of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Committee and Liu Yiyan, the director of the Construction Department of Anhui Province, and other parties, and obtained the Marketing Office's opinions on the tea merchants. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sales Director's Resignation Not Approved</p>
<p>Chen Yizhou and other chairmen and members of the Foreign Tea Industry Association negotiated cooperation methods with Cheng Zhenji and Zeng Zhen of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Office. It was decided that the position of sales director of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Office would be held by Zheng Jianyuan, the manager of Yuanfengrun Tea Merchants. Mr. Zheng had been hired and assumed the position. On the 16th of this month, the Marketing Office suddenly received a letter from Mr. Zheng requesting resignation and immediately stopped going to the Marketing Office to work. After consultation with Cheng Zhenji, Zeng Zhen, and others, the managers of the Marketing Office, it was decided not to approve the resignation. Yesterday, a letter was sent to Mr. Zheng stating, "In response to your letter of May 16th, stating that you cannot leave the position of fellow industry members and that there are still many obstacles in the research of the work outline, please approve the resignation of the position of sales team director and no longer go to the office from now on. After investigation, our office hired you as the sales team director not because you have the qualifications of a tea merchant representative. Now that you have been hired for a while, new teas are pouring in. We should work hard to promote sales and live up to the government's earnest expectations. How can you want to shirk responsibility? Isn't this intentionally obstructing progress? If it delays progress, you deserve the blame, and we will report to the government for severe punishment without leniency. The request for resignation should not be discussed. A corresponding letter is hereby replied to. I hope you will investigate and deal with everything quickly and actively, and live up to expectations."</p>
<p>Liu Yiyan Discusses Seeking Other Methods</p>
<p>Liu Yiyan, the director of the Construction Department of Anhui Province, explained in detail the government's situation in rescuing black tea, saying, "The establishment of the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Marketing Office by the government is not to overthrow the tea merchants, but to rescue Qimen black tea, improve the quality of black tea, reduce costs, and develop foreign sales. The Marketing Office lent 400,000 to tea merchants in Anhui and other places to rescue them at low interest rates. Unexpectedly, the Tea Industry Association misunderstood and thought that it was to overthrow the tea merchants. It stopped lending to tea merchants in Anhui and wanted to monopolize it. However, the government authorities have always taken rescuing black tea as the principle, and they will not change the original plan because of this. As for the tea merchants suspending the exchange of black tea, the Marketing Office will seek other sales methods." It is reported that Mr. Liu has completed his mission in Shanghai and plans to return to Anhui today.</p>
<p>Foreign Tea Merchants Expressed No Opinion</p>
<p>More than ten foreign tea merchants in the city, such as Jardine Matheson, Jinlong Trading Company, and Tongfu Trading Company, held a meeting last Saturday and invited Cheng Zhenji, Zeng Zhen, and Cui Zhong, the managers of the Marketing Office, to participate, but there were no results. Therefore, they held another joint meeting at 5 pm yesterday, attended by foreign merchants from the UK, Russia, the US, France, Germany, and Portugal, as well as Cheng Zhenji, Zeng Zhen, and Cui Zhong from the Marketing Office. They discussed in detail the methods of improving the quality, packaging, and baking of black tea, and did not express opinions on our country's control and marketing.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei: No News of Early Return to China</h3>
<p>Central News Agency said, "Yesterday, the local evening newspaper reported that Wang Zhaoming's illness has slightly improved, and due to the death of Hu Hanmin, there is talk of an early return to China. Reporters inquired from Wang's residence and other parties, and Wang's illness has not yet healed, the bullet has not been removed, and there is no news of an early return to China."</p>

<h3>The Siam Study Group to Hold a Member Meeting Today</h3>
<p>To Exchange Views and Discuss Study Steps at the Temporary Office in the New Asia Hotel</p>

<h3>A Theater Inspector Scammed and Assaulted by a Prostitute: An Amusing Drama That Failed to Truly Soothe the Spirit; Corner of Eye Bruised from Beating</h3>
<p>Gao Fengjiang, a 31-year-old Nanjing native, worked as an inspector at the Gongwutai Theater next to the Great World entertainment complex. Around 5 or 6 PM on the 16th, he met Yan Wenxiu, a Chaozhou prostitute who played mahjong (age 21, residing above the Fu Ji barbershop at the intersection of Xilaihuo Street on Avenue Dubail), in front of the Gongwutai Theater's dragon gate. The two exchanged glances and quickly became acquainted. Gao then accompanied Yan to room number 22 at the Baxian First Family Inn in Hengmao Lane, Baxian Bridge, which cost 6 jiao and 1.5 fen. Gao only had three yuan in foreign currency on him, and after paying for the room, he had only two yuan and three jiao and seven fen left. He gave the two yuan to the prostitute Yan as payment for her services, hoping to find some solace. At this time, Yan demanded five yuan, but Gao replied that he only had that amount and couldn't offer more. Yan accepted the two yuan, saying she was going out to buy some supplies and would return soon, asking Gao to wait. However, Yan never came back. Gao waited for a long time but didn't see her return, so he dejectedly went home alone, muttering in frustration. On the afternoon of the 17th, a Sunday, the theater had a matinee performance. Gao was working at the theater when, suddenly, Yan called him out of the theater and into the alley next door. There, she persistently demanded to borrow five yuan, which Gao refused. Yan then directed two previously arranged female accomplices waiting in the alley to help her hold Gao down and beat him, causing a bruise to his right eye. The two accomplices took the opportunity to escape. Gao managed to hold onto Yan and called for the police, who arrested her. Gao accused Yan of fraud and assault, and after investigation by Detective Chen Jiuxiang, the facts were confirmed. Yesterday, the police sent Yan to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Chen Mosheng presided over the hearing, and lawyer Gu Shouxi of the Police Affairs Department presented the case, requesting an extension for further investigation before prosecuting. Subsequently, the plaintiff Gao Fengjiang recounted the experience of being defrauded and assaulted. The court reviewed the testimonies, briefly questioned the defendant, and adjourned the hearing to the 25th. The defendant was released on bail of 30 yuan pending further investigation, and the plaintiff was instructed to undergo a medical examination to assess his injuries.</p>
<h3>Shi Yunjie Accused of Forcibly Defiling a Female Servant</h3>
<p>A maidservant has her marriage agreement nullified by her fiancé's family, her life's virtue destroyed</p>
<p>Shi Yunjie, the owner of the Yuheng Exchange in Songxing Road, Wusong Town, and Lu Laoer, a woman residing at No. 21, Tongshou Lane, Chengdu Road, have recently been accused by Yao Pinzhen (also known as Yao Daizhi, 18 years old), a woman from Qidong, Jiangsu Province, through her legal representative, her father Yao Ruxiang. The lawyer Guang Xingjian filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing them of obstructing moral cultivation and requesting strict punishment. The grounds for the lawsuit are as follows: Pinzhen came to Shanghai in early October last year. Through the introduction of her fellow villager Xi Jianmin, she worked as a maidservant at Shi Yunjie's residence. Unexpectedly, Shi saw that Pinzhen possessed some beauty and tried to seduce her in every way. He falsely claimed that he wanted to marry her as his second wife and lured Pinzhen to Lu Laoer's residence, pretending she would stay there temporarily. Then, with Lu's help, he took Pinzhen to a room at a hotel on Xizang Road where Shi Yunjie raped her for several nights in a row. Later, Lu Laoer brought Yao Pinzhen back to No. 21, Tongyi Lane, Chengdu Road, and hid her there, monitoring her movements. In the meantime, Yao's father came to Shanghai to inquire about her whereabouts, but Shi falsely claimed he didn't know. It wasn't until March of this year that Yao found a chance to send a letter to her father in Qidong through a fortune teller. After receiving the letter, her father came to Shanghai and took Yao out of Lu Laoer's house. Yao Pinzhen was already engaged at the age of ten, but the defendants conspired to forcibly rape and defile her, destroying her chastity. As a result, her fiancé's family found out and declared the marriage agreement null and void. Yao's life and reputation have been utterly ruined. The defendants' actions clearly violate the criminal law and should be brought to justice and severely punished. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Eighth Criminal Court to summon the accused. Lu Laoer did not appear, only Shi Yunjie surrendered to the court. The plaintiff, Yao Pinzhen, also appeared, but her father, Yao Ruxiang, did not. Judge Jiang briefly questioned them and ordered the case to be adjourned for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Xu Yi's Case: No Third Trial Allowed</h3>
<p>The Higher Second Branch Court Rejected the Appeal</p>
<p>Li Zhongchen, the manager of the former Taihehe Flour Mill, sued lawyer Xu Yi and his younger brother Xu Yiming, along with Xu Yi's father-in-law Zhao Peichou, for forgery and fraud. The First Special District Court sentenced Xu Yi to eight months in prison, Xu Yiming to a fine of 300 yuan, and dismissed the case against Zhao Peichou. The two Xus were also jointly and severally liable for returning 100,870 yuan to the plaintiff. Both parties disagreed with the verdict and appealed. The Higher First Branch Court upheld the sentences for the Xu brothers. Zhao Peichou’s case was re-considered, and he was fined 800 yuan. The three Xus were dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court through the Higher Second Branch Court. Yesterday, the Criminal Division Chief of the Higher Second Branch Court, Yu Hua, rejected the appeal. The reason given was that the crimes for which the Xus were sentenced fell under Article 214 of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of three years. Zhao Peichou's sentence was based on Article 339 of the Criminal Code. Both of these articles fall under Article 61 of the Criminal Code, which limits appeals to the third trial. Therefore, they were not allowed to appeal to the Third Instance Court and the appeal was rejected in accordance with Articles 368 and 376 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

Kui reported the matter to the Gordon Road Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Sun Yuanlin, the gatekeeper of the lane, and Zhou Xiangda. They were sent to the First Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Tan Zhuzhen presided over the continuation of the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court.

<h3>Qingpu Baihegang Kidnapping Case: Hostage Escapes and Finds Safety; Kidnappers Falsely Claimed the Hideout Was in Hangzhou, Hostage Only Realized it Was in Shanghai After Escaping</h3>
<p>—Detectives Arrest Four Male and Female Gang Members—</p>
<p>Shi Yunqing of Baihegang, Qingpu County, is a renowned ophthalmologist and eye specialist. He has three sons, the eldest, Yanfei, seventeen years old, is currently studying at the local elementary school. On the sixth day of this month, at around 10 PM, eight bandits, carrying one box cannon and two rifles, arrived. Two bandits guarded the front and back doors, while the rest broke through the back door and forced the entire Shi family of over ten people into a small room at the back, guarded by one bandit with a gun. The other bandits ransacked the house at will, stealing a four-inch Mauser pistol, a large amount of jewelry, and many valuable clothes. However, the bandits were not satisfied. As they left, they kidnapped Yanfei and fled with shouts. After the bandits left, Shi Yunqing reported the kidnapping of his eldest son, Yanfei, to the local Public Security Bureau, which in turn reported it to the Qingpu County Government. The County Government issued a strict order for their arrest. After kidnapping Yanfei, the bandits hid the hostage on a boat moored near the town, and then sailed to Caojiadu, West Shanghai. (They falsely claimed to the hostage that this was Hangzhou.) On the second day after arriving in Shanghai, they moved the hostage to the bandit den at No. 378 Song's Residence, Zhoujiaqiao, Caojiadu, and assigned bandits to guard him day and night. They also sent three letters to Qingpu Post Office, demanding a huge ransom, and were afraid of leaks. The Public Security Bureau found out. In the early morning, they hid the hostage in a straw hut without a number opposite the Shuiliandiangongchang (Water and Electricity Award Factory) on Zhongshan Road, still guarded by two bandits. The day before yesterday afternoon, Yanfei saw one bandit going out to fetch water and the other dozing off. Thinking it was a good opportunity, he tiptoed out of the bandit's den and ran all the way to near Datong University. He saw a police officer standing guard and immediately cried for help. Seeing the words "Shanghai City" on the officer's collar, he realized that this place was not Hangzhou. The officer telegraphed to the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station. After questioning him, Officer Wan accompanied Yanfei to report to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau. Tan Baotao, the chief of the branch bureau, immediately ordered Zhao Fan and Huang Zhonghe, the captain and vice-captain of the detective team, along with team leaders Tang Bingxiang and Song Ziming, detectives Ya Diling, Li Bingsen, and Li Pinquan, to join forces with Police Chief Fa Jinzhang and twelve police officers. Yesterday afternoon at around 4 PM, they rushed to the location and surrounded the bandit den. Captain Zhao Fan and others stormed in and arrested Yu Qingquan (27 years old) from Anhui, who was guarding the hostage, and Wang Chen, a female bandit (27 years old) who was in charge of delivering food, along with the suspected accomplices Lu Jinzhou and Chen Yang, a total of four people. After bringing them back to the bureau, the hostage identified them correctly. The director of the bureau, believing that the case involved kidnapping and ransom, ordered all four suspects to be detained and telegraphed to Qingpu, asking Shi Yunqing to come to Shanghai immediately to bring the hostage home for a reunion, while at the same time ordering the arrest of the remaining bandits at large for severe punishment.</p>

<h3>National Products Expo Opening Postponed; Setup on the 21st, Opening on the 22nd; Affairs and Other Sections Have Moved to the Site to Work</h3>
<p>Since the preparation for the Shanghai National Products Expo, the participating manufacturers have been quite enthusiastic. As of yesterday, more than 120 companies have signed up. The association was originally scheduled to open the exposition tomorrow (the 20th), but due to the continuous rain in recent days, the construction of the venue has been slightly delayed. Furthermore, some later participating manufacturers are concerned that the setup will be insufficient, and have asked for a postponement. After deliberation by the executive committee yesterday, the association decided to postpone the opening for two days to officially open at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd. It is scheduled to start at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 21st, when each factory will come to the site to set up in order to exhibit as scheduled. It is reported that in order to facilitate the manufacturers' contact and supervise the construction of the workers, the association has moved affairs, setup, accounting, publicity, and other sections to the venue since yesterday to facilitate the progress.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance Requesting Implementation of the Abolition of Transit Duty</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: On the 16th of this month, we received a letter from the Transportation and Customs Brokers Association stating that the customs brokerage industry specializes in transporting goods for customers, and the need for transportation lies in shipping, so our industry is closely related to shipping. Since the Ministry of Communications implemented intermodal transportation, the shipping industry has been declining day by day, and our industry has become increasingly precarious. Because civil ships, railways, and various highways transport goods from inland ports to treaty ports, transit duty must still be paid for goods transported between treaty ports, so that shippers and passengers refuse to use ships in order to avoid transit duty and reduce costs. As a result, ship freight has gradually decreased, and our industry has been greatly affected. The development of transportation is bound to involve competition, but the tax authorities should treat water and land transportation equally. Moreover, the domestic railway is still under construction, and after the completion of each road, it will be accessible in all directions. If the transit duty is not abolished, ships will not be able to transport goods, and the livelihood of our industry will be cut off. For the sake of the future of our industry, we cannot sit and wait for death. We should ask your council to quickly send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance to immediately implement the original plan to abolish the transit duty in order to help the businesses in distress and provide relief." Accordingly, we believe that the abolition of transit duty is of great importance to the survival of our industry. The points mentioned by our members are indeed true. We hereby send this letter to you, hoping that your council will forward it to the Ministry of Finance, and earnestly request that it be realized as soon as possible in order to comfort the expectations of the business community and provide assistance for maintenance, which is for the public convenience." The Ministry of Finance had already prepared to implement the abolition of transit duty in June of last year, but resistance suddenly arose due to the method of compensation, and it has been suspended to this day because it is necessary to raise new tax revenue. In view of the aforementioned situation, the cargo transfer in provinces and regions covered by railways and highways does not involve customs, and most transit duties are not levied. It is natural for merchants to abandon water and take land. It is obvious that the revenue from this transit duty in places that rely solely on water transportation is decreasing. Instead of leaving this abnormal system in place, it would be better to unify water and land transportation as soon as possible. Moreover, the new compensation tax has been discussed for many years and is about to be implemented, so there is no need to worry about the source of revenue. We should report the situation to your ministry and request that you approve and act in accordance with the request of the association, which is for the public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Shooting After Loan Request Denied, Injuring Genitals and Intestines; Xie A'si Wounded and Brought to Court; Assailant's Confession Attempts to Shirk Responsibility</h3>
<p>Xie A'si, 23 years old, from Wuxi, lived on Jumen Road in the Nanshi district and worked as a coppersmith. On the afternoon of March 15th, at around 2 PM, Cai Genyu, the owner of Yutai Cigarette and Paper Shop, suddenly came to invite him to drink tea at a nearby stove, and made a request to loan him money. An argument broke out when Xie A'si denied it. Cai Genyu became enraged and left in a huff. He gathered Yao Changsheng, Cai Changsheng, and others, armed with handguns, and went to Xie A'si's house, coaxed Xie out, and shot him in the lower abdomen, causing him to lose consciousness immediately. Seeing that they had caused trouble, Cai and the others scattered. The police learned of the incident and sent the wounded man to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Xie's family reported the incident to the police station, and ordered the police to arrest the three suspects, Cai Genyu, Cai Changsheng, and Yao Changsheng, who were then sent to the District Court. Prosecutor Lei, citing Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law on attempted murder, filed a public prosecution. At 10 AM yesterday morning, Cai Dincheng, the presiding judge of the criminal division, tried the case in the Criminal Division III. The plaintiff, Xie A'si, accompanied by his attorney Cai Shuying, testified in court that he was injured after his request for a loan was denied, and that he was shot in the genitals and intestines, which have now rotted. He still needs abdominal surgery and cannot be discharged from the hospital recently. Since March 15th, the medical expenses have totaled 386 yuan, and he requests that the defendant be ordered to repay him. Hu, a member of the Ximen Police Station, testified in court and provided evidence of everything. When questioned, the defendant Cai Genyu, 28 years old, owner of a cigarette and paper shop, admitted to the assault, but claimed that at around 11 AM that morning, he went to the Ximen Branch Bureau to visit his friend Zheng Ziliang (from Guangdong) because of a fight with his apprentice, and that he was wrongly accused. Cai Changsheng testified that he was 32 years old, from Shanghai, and worked in sand casting. On the morning of March 15th, at around 9 AM, he went to Pudong for some business and was not at home. He claimed that he was wronged by Xie A'si, who accused him of the shooting without knowing who shot him. At this point, the judge announced that the defendant Yao Changsheng was not present today, and that the case still requires investigation and the testimony of witnesses. The hearing will be continued. The defendants were released on their original bail.</p>
<h3>Committee for Raising Funds to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Greetings Sends Letters to All Sectors Soliciting Donations</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Committee for Expanding the National Aviation Salvation Movement in Shanghai, Raising Funds to Purchase Aircraft, and Presenting Them to the Government as a Memorial for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday has been actively working since its establishment. The committee has printed and distributed birthday announcements to people from all walks of life, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The original text of the committee's letter to all sectors is as follows: "Respectfully, the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the summer season of Dinghai (October 29th) is the fiftieth birthday of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, the current President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Commission. The people of the whole country are dancing and singing to express their congratulations. We believe that in ancient times, the celebration of a person's birthday was either spread through poems and songs, or passed on through praises, or sincerity was expressed with jade and silk, or beauty was conveyed with robes and furs. Following this tradition, it has become a common practice. However, Mr. Chiang is committed to selflessness and public service, rejecting extravagance and advocating practicality, setting an example for his subordinates and guiding the entire nation. If we still follow the old ways, offering flattery and praise, it would not only run counter to the new era, but also greatly violate the sincerity from the heart. Therefore, all forms of superficiality are meaningless. Moreover, the country is in dire straits today. Internally, the bandits have not yet been eliminated, and externally, hidden worries are lurking. Mr. Chiang, with his talent and ability, bears the heavy responsibility of the military and the state, and is exhausted for the sake of the country. For ten years, the people have been able to live and work in peace, and have not been disturbed by war. Tracing the origin, we all owe this to Mr. Chiang. Now that his birthday is approaching, we respectfully follow the Yuan's decree, instructing the entire country not to allow extravagance. This shows his sincerity in putting the public before the private, and we should strive to repay him with our utmost efforts. We deeply appreciate his kindness and admire his noble character. We believe that since Mr. Chiang has dedicated himself to the country, we should also seek to repay the country in order to repay Mr. Chiang. This is the best way to respond to his special favor and conform to public opinion. With popular sentiment being in agreement, contribution should be given priority. We have heard that when the German head of state, Mr. Hitler, celebrated his birthday, the people of his country purchased airplanes to express their congratulations. This shows their love for the head of state, which is also equivalent to loving the country. It has become a beautiful story in the world and is praised as a great event. As citizens of our country, how can we be left behind? Purchasing aircraft to pay tribute is the unanimous opinion of the public. You, the leaders of the community, are admired by all. You have always been willing to do what is right. Please contribute your private funds to this great public cause, which not only fulfills the duty of serving the country, but also expresses the sincerity of our congratulations. We trust that you will sympathize and await your clear guidance. We hereby send you this announcement and wish you peace and prosperity."</p>

Those who continue to join will be added to the supplement. The staff and workers of factories throughout the city will donate their "May 1st" Labor Day wages to purchase aircraft. Letters have been sent to each factory to deduct the amount during the distribution of wages and remit it to the Shanghai Bank. The Shanghai Municipal Party and Government Unification Promotion Committee has proposed to donate a certain amount of the sales price for the purpose of sponsoring the purchase of aircraft for birthday greetings. Theaters and bookstores have successively held performances to donate to the purchase of aircraft for birthday greetings, with excellent results. Movie theaters and amusement parks can also be handled recently. Field secretaries should assist in the progress in order to achieve universal coverage. The measures for collecting aviation salvation funds from the lime boat industry have been revised and approved by the municipal government and are scheduled to be piloted on the 20th of this month. The fundraising by various fundraising teams and industries is proceeding smoothly.

<h3>Hua Yang Charity Relief Association: A Record of the Farewell Tea Party for Bell and Locke</h3>
<p>The China Hua Yang Charity Relief Association, located at No. 50, Henan Road, Shanghai, held a farewell tea party for Mr. Bell on the occasion of his return to his country, and Mr. Luo Chuanhua, the director of the Shanghai office, on the occasion of his trip to the United States to attend the Pacific International Society. The association asked the two gentlemen to report the domestic disaster situation and the work of the association over the years to the overseas Chinese in various ports, and to solicit suggestions. The two gentlemen are about to set off, and the executive committee, the Yangtze River Basin Advisory Committee, and the Shanghai Voluntary Committee of the association jointly invited gentlemen from the charity community to hold a farewell tea party at the Guo Family Garden on Jing'an Temple Road at 4 PM on the 17th of this month, as previously reported. Those who attended on that day included Wang Zhengting, Zhu Youyu, Yan Fuqing, Li Denghui, Zheng Lai, Ma Yinliang, Gui Huaquan, Guo Shun, Luo Weilian, Bao Naide, Fei Wusheng, An Xianjin, Duda, and other Chinese and foreign guests, more than 100 people in all, which was quite a grand occasion. After serving refreshments, Dr. Zhu Youyu took the lead to stand up and report on Mr. Bell's achievements in providing disaster relief during his more than 20 years in China, and Mr. Luo's hard work in handling the donations for the Yangtze River floods last year, and expressed everything in detail. He also wished the two gentlemen success in their trip to the United States, to promote the success of construction and disaster relief to the overseas Chinese. Then, he presented the inscription given by Wang Zhengting, the chairman of the association, and Ms. Peng Wangquan translated it into English and read it aloud to the audience. Finally, Mr. Bell stood up to express his gratitude. His words were extremely sincere, and he said, "I have been in China for more than 20 years, and I have had the opportunity to participate in joint relief efforts during the time when your country has suffered many disasters. This is truly a great opportunity for me to serve the people. Rather than saying that I have made contributions, it is better to say that I have increased my experience. This time, I will accompany Mr. Luo to promote and contact the overseas Chinese in your country, and I will definitely work hard to live up to the expectations of you all. I am deeply honored and grateful to be invited to hold this farewell meeting." By the time the clock struck six, everyone took a group photo and the guests and hosts parted happily.</p>
<h3>Guo Futing Sued by Female Servant to Confirm Her Identity; Both Parties Hope to Settle Amicably; Court Approves Postponement</h3>
<p>Guo Futing, a wealthy merchant from Chaozhou living in Shanghai, resided at No. 4, Fuan Lane, South Chengdu Road. In July of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), he had a relationship with his female servant Chen Lianxiang. Subsequently, on June 3rd of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), Chen gave birth to a son, named Guan Hong. At that time, Chen requested that Guo draw up a contract stipulating that 150,000 yuan of property would be given to Guan Hong, and another 50,000 yuan would be given to her, but this amount would only be paid after Guan Hong came of age. Guo agreed to the terms, but later they disagreed and separated. Guo gave her a considerable sum of money as a settlement for canceling the contract. Guan Hong was raised by Guo's first wife. After the separation, Chen Lianxiang became pregnant again after a long time. Chen hired attorney Sun Zuji to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Guo Futing to confirm her identity. Her requests were twofold: first, to confirm that Guan Hong and Chen Lianxiang had a mother-son relationship; and second, to request confirmation that the fetus in Chen Lianxiang's womb belonged to Guo. The court approved the request, and Judge Zhang summoned them to the Civil Division 4 yesterday morning. Guo also hired attorney Chen Tingrui to represent him. Because both parties hoped to reach a settlement, the plaintiff requested a postponement, which the court approved, and ordered a reschedule for the hearing.</p>

<h3>Fu Baolu's Pole Vault Sets New Far East Record</h3>
<p>Result: 4.015 Meters; National Records Also Set in High Hurdles and Discus</p>
<p>Beiping, 18th—In the fourth test of the World Games track and field team on the 18th, Fu Baolu broke the Far East record of 4 meters in the pole vault with 4.015 meters. Lin Shaozhou achieved 15.6 seconds in the high hurdles, Huang Yingjie achieved 16 seconds, and Guo Jie achieved 39.7 meters in the discus, all breaking national records.

The athletes will compete against the top three from the Ping City Spring Games on the 25th, and they will depart for Shanghai on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the World Games, Leaves the Country This Morning</h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Zhengting, a member of the Central Committee, was appointed as the head of the Chinese delegation to the World Games. He once entered Beijing and then turned to Anhui to attend the founding conference of the Wuhu International Rotary Club branch. At 4:25 PM on the 17th, he took the China Aviation Corporation Shanghai-Hankou flight eastward. After finishing his business, he returned to Shanghai. He has been quite busy these days, attending tea parties held by Mayor Wu and the Sino-German Cultural Association. Last night, he and his wife, Ms. Shi Meili, boarded the President Coolidge, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Company, and set sail this morning. According to Wang's remarks before leaving, he will first go to the United States to attend the International Rotary Club Conference held in Bloomingdale on June 22nd, and then cross the Atlantic Ocean to Germany to attend the World Games.</p>
<h3>The French Government and All Parties Oppose Participation in the World Games</h3>
<p>But the French Olympic Committee Still Insists on Participating</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 17th—The Olympic Games will open in Berlin in August this year. The question of whether French athletes should go to participate is now being fiercely debated, and it is difficult to resolve for the time being. Since Germany unilaterally abolished the Zaccarno Convention, some people in France have opposed their athletes participating in competitions under the Swastika flag. Recently, during the House of Representatives election campaign, the opposition of the left-wing parties became even more intense. After the re-election results, the left-wing people's money won a victory, and this issue was formally raised. The Standing Committee of the Socialist Party has now clearly expressed its opposition to the athletes going to Germany, and the Communist Party has also expressed the same attitude. As for the right-wing people, they also mostly hold opposing views, but the reasons are completely different. In the current situation, after the new House of Representatives is convened, the majority of members will certainly not approve the funding for athletes to go to Germany. The French Olympic Committee is quite worried about this, but they said that they will wait for the right time to submit this matter to the future cabinet. Even if the government refuses to allocate funds, the committee will do its best to raise funds on its own, so as to ensure that the athletes can make the trip. But if the government does not allow the athletes to depart, then it will be another matter. According to reports, the issue of French athletes participating is becoming increasingly complex due to the existence of two major sports organizations in the country. One is the National Sports Advancement Association, which has no political implications, and the other is the Labor Sports Association, whose activities are invariably intertwined with the United General Labor Union, but has no relationship with the Olympic Committee. When the International Labor Games are held in Barcelona, Spain in August this year, the association will also send people to participate.</p>

Then the chairman of the presidium, Tong Xinghu, reported and introduced Dai Jitao's speech. Dai said in his speech that the happiness we enjoy is a gift from the hard work of our ancestors, so Boy Scouts should aspire to endure hardship, create happiness for others, serve the people, and do a good deed every day. His words were very encouraging and touched the listeners. A response was given by Leng Xueqiao of the presidium, and the meeting was adjourned with a group photo. Also, yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the Municipal Boy Scout Council convened all the group leaders in a discussion meeting at the Sichuan Road YMCA. More than one hundred council members and group leaders attended. Leng Xueqiao chaired the meeting, and Xie Yanbo took the minutes. After the ceremony, Secretary Luo Lie reported on the arrangements, regulations, discipline, agreements, and participation requirements for the City Boy Scout Conference. After the meeting, everyone had dinner together and dispersed happily around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Board Meeting of Luoyang Treasure Experiment Zone</h3>
<p>The Luoyang Treasure Experiment Zone has been operating for two years, and the experimental work has achieved remarkable results. As the new year is about to begin, many matters need to be discussed. Therefore, the fourth board meeting was convened in Beijing yesterday. The directors who attended were Zhang Puquan, Liu Zhi (represented by Huang Jixi), Niu Yongjian, Yu Qingtang, Chen Fangxian, Zhao Mian, Song Xiangzhou, Sheng Shiheng, Zhao Guangtao, Guo Fangwu, and Chen Dabai, a total of eleven people. Niu Yongjian chaired the meeting and resolved seven motions. In addition to appointing the standing director for the third year and deciding the date and location of the fifth board meeting, the important ones were: to prepare the results and detailed methods of the experimental micro-system and the mentoring system, and submit them to the province and county for reference and implementation; to request the Ministry of Education to allocate funds from the funds for compulsory education and vocational education to subsidize the experimental expenses of the zone; the guiding office and various agricultural agencies to negotiate and develop rural economic methods; and the guiding office to prepare a pilot plan for compulsory afforestation and submit it to the Luoyang County Government for assistance.</p>
<h3>Basic Principles of National Salvation Education (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Broadcast Speech by President Dai</p>
<p>If these people have undergone extremely strict group training, then this waterproofing work will definitely be exceptionally effective. In addition, in any natural disaster or man-made calamity, if the people have training, they will definitely be able to work in an orderly manner, and everyone will achieve great success. In society, any undertaking can progress. Therefore, this kind of education is not only the military value that ordinary people think of, but it is really in the lives, occupations, and social order of the general public, and especially in the political and economic development of the country. In the midst of such great changes in the world, and with China in such a dangerous situation, it must be able to complete the education of revolution and national salvation. The key to completing this education is to "emphasize both skill and virtue, cultivate both literary and military skills." Academic skills and principles, morality, literary affairs, and military affairs are equally emphasized. Everyone receives military education, literary education, and technical education, and cultivates their body, mind, and morality in order to achieve the goal of saving the country. This is the key point of the ten guidelines of the declaration of the Fifth National Congress and Sixth Plenary Session, and it is also the consistent revolutionary policy of the Chinese Kuomintang. If everyone can take out the declaration of the Fifth National Congress and carefully read it from beginning to end, they can know that "emphasizing both skill and virtue and cultivating both literary and military skills" is indeed an important principle for building and saving the country. Tonight, I cannot give a detailed speech. I hope everyone will carefully read the declaration of the Fifth National Congress and refer to the Premier's Three Principles of the People revolutionary works, as well as Mr. Chiang's speeches and talks on running schools, governing the army, and the people. Then you can know the basic spirit of the Fifth National Congress declaration. The World Games held in Berlin this time, all aspects of China are very familiar with them. China sent dozens of athletes to participate, and the central government sent my brother to represent the government to participate in the grand event. The central government's intention is to clearly indicate that the promotion of national sports is not only in national sports, but it is really to promote the entire education, that is, to change the declining spirit of the past. I hope all the people and all comrades will work hard, and I hope that all the athletes and the general public will pay attention to the actual situation of the education of various countries that emphasizes both literary and military skills, so that the education of our country in the future, especially under the principle of "emphasizing both skill and virtue and cultivating both literary and military skills," can obtain the stones from other mountains, and obtain some new experiences, as a reference for building revolutionary education. This is the important issue that my brother was sent out to investigate.</p>
<p>Tonight, in this short period of time, I can only raise this issue and hope that everyone will study it. And I hope that everyone will implement the above-mentioned matters determined by the central government. (Complete)</p>
<h3>A Message to Young Scientists</h3>
<p>Posthumous Work of Professor Pavlov of Soviet Russia</p>
<p>The great Soviet scientist Pavlov passed away in Leningrad on February 28th of this year. Mr. Pavlov devoted his life to scientific research, and his new contributions to physiology and psychology are world-renowned. Because of Mr. Pavlov, Soviet Russia has been able to occupy a very important position in the recent scientific community. After Mr. Pavlov's death, the Soviet People's Committee decided to build a monument in the central square of Leningrad and rename the Leningrad First Hospital as the Pavlov Medical College to admire the sage. Recently, the Science Society of China's "Science" magazine published an article by Mr. Pavlov to young scientists. Although this article by Mr. Pavlov was written for young scientists in Soviet Russia, its content is actually a guide for general scientific researchers. It is specially reprinted here, hoping that young scientists in our country will pay attention to it. (Yin Liang)</p>
<p>What are my hopes for the young people in our country who are dedicated to science?</p>
<p>First, Progress Step by Step: If we want to have good research results, progress step by step is a necessary condition. Researching science must progress step by step. When starting scientific research work, one must cultivate a strict spirit of progressing step by step as the only way to explore learning. If you want to reach the pinnacle of science, you must start from the initial stage of learning. If the basic knowledge is not yet thoroughly understood, you must never be greedy for new knowledge.</p>
<p>You must not use extremely large conjectures or assumptions to cover up your ignorance. You must know that a bubble blown from soapy water, no matter how beautiful it looks, will eventually burst. In the end, in addition to embarrassing yourself, you will gain nothing. When engaging in scientific research, you must be cautious, you must be persistent, you must be accustomed to doing the basic work of science, and you must study facts, collect facts, and compare facts. Just like the two wings of a bird, which are its good tools. Without the support of the air, it will never be able to soar into the clouds.</p>
<p>Facts are the air of scientists. Without facts, scientists will hardly have profound achievements. Without facts, all theories will eventually become books. However, when researching, experimenting, or observing, you must not stop at the surface of the facts, nor can you simply become a recorder of facts. You must try to thoroughly explore the roots of the facts, and you must always persevere in seeking the law that governs the facts.</p>
<p>Second, Humility: When studying, you must never have a sense of complacency. No matter how others praise you, you must always have the courage to tell yourself, "I am ignorant." Never be proud, otherwise, confined by prejudices, you will inevitably deny the truth. Because of self-pride, you will refuse helpful guidance and friendly assistance. As a result, you will inevitably lose your objective attitude and spirit.</p>
<p>Our guiding research work can be carried out in a good atmosphere. Colleagues all work together in the spirit of mutual assistance to promote this common work. Therefore, when we work, it is difficult to distinguish between each other. The success of our joint work is also based on this spirit of "public service and forgetting private interests."</p>
<p>Third, Enthusiasm: Remember that scientific endeavors require our lifelong labor. And life is only a hundred years, even if our life can be extended by one time, it is not enough to complete the research.</p>
<p>The initial pursuit of science requires great effort and sincere enthusiasm. You should have a passionate feeling for your work and research.</p>
<p>We should always thank the country for creating a great research field for scientists and for fully instilling science into life. What I can tell young scientists is that since the country has given so many opportunities and help, the country naturally also hopes that they will make great efforts and contribute a lot. How should the young scientists of our country, as well as our adults, work hard to live up to the country's great expectations for promoting science? This is really a matter of our honor.

<h3>Preparatory Committee for the Third Children's Summer Health Camp</h3>
<p>Adoption of the Preparatory Committee's Constitution and Election of Preparatory Committee Members</p>
<p>Expansion of the number of children admitted to the camp to 220</p>
<p>The Summer Children's Health Camp initiated and founded by the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association aims to improve the physical and mental health of children during the holidays and cultivate good habits. Therefore, the first meeting of initiators and preparatory committee was held at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Li Zhaozhang reported that the previous two sessions held in Wusong were successful. He detailed the income and expenses, the constitution of this session, and the plan to expand the quota to 220 people, find ways to reduce fees, and extend the dates from July 5th to August 19th to one and a half months. After the children enter the camp, all their daily life, exercise, improvements, etc., will abide by the regulations to make progress. The meeting discussed the draft constitution and the problems of cleaning equipment and mosquito control. It was decided that they would be submitted to the second preparatory meeting for further discussion. At the meeting, 15 institutions and organizations were selected to serve as preparatory committee members to be responsible for the implementation, including the Municipal Government, the Education Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Children's Welfare Association, the Children's Year Implementation Committee, the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Tongji University, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, Zhonghai Girls' High School, Xianqiao YMCA, China Children's Welfare Association, Gaoqiao Health Clinic, and Wusong Health Clinic.</p>
<h3>World Children's Goodwill Day</h3>
<p>Welsh Children Hold Worldwide Goodwill Broadcast</p>
<p>Yesterday was World Children's Goodwill Day. The Central Broadcasting Station of our country's capital broadcasted a special program for World Children's Goodwill Day starting at 7:30 PM. Children in Wales, England, held the 15th World Children's Goodwill Broadcast at the BBC radio station yesterday. The original text of the broadcast was profound and insightful. Chen Zhengfan, director of the education department of the China Children's Welfare Association, translated it into Chinese as follows:</p>
<p>"Children all over the world, both boys and girls, separated by thousands of miles and across the ocean, please accept the sincere greetings from us Welsh boys and girls today.</p>
<p>"On this 'Goodwill Day,' we salute you in the name of explorers and pioneers of human civilization. On some oceans, on some continents, those explorers and pioneers of human civilization have spread the mystery of the universe, endured difficulties, and risked dangers, searching forward with all their hearts, not knowing what retreat is. Some of them have already conquered thousands of difficulties, and some are conquering thousands of difficulties. We are enjoying happiness and prosperity because of their efforts.</p>
<p>"Boys and girls all over the world, the great achievements of all human heroes should give us so much encouragement and bewilderment. Shouldn't we use the same noble spirit to complete the most noble attempt, to promote peace among mankind? Shouldn't we re-resolve today to engage in this most difficult and greatest adventure?</p>
<p>"Boys and girls all over the world, based on our friendship and bravery, we will surely be able to conquer thousands of difficulties!"</p>
<p>According to the Broadcasting Affairs Management Office of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, our side officially sent a letter to the children of Wales, England, in early April of this year, expressing the willingness of children across the country to work hand in hand to promote the goodwill of children around the world, and informing them that the Central Broadcasting Station of China decided to broadcast a special program for World Children's Goodwill Day on the afternoon of May 18th.</p>

<h3>To Modern Ladies</h3>
<p>— Yao Xingshu</p>
<p>—Here are some of the harms of high-heeled leather shoes—</p>
<p>Psychology books clearly state that everyone has a sense of aesthetics. A poor boy is also a person, and naturally has the same feelings. When you dress up as beautiful as flowers and appear in my eyes, my aesthetic emotions will unconsciously be revealed. To be honest, it is inevitable, almost certain that I will glance at you a few times to feel at ease. Loving beauty and appreciating beauty is the innate nature of mankind, and it seems that there is nothing wrong with it. Seeing you face to face, with powdered cheeks and vermilion lips, and delicate breasts and jade arms, of course I watch you leave; looking at the background again, your slender waists sway lightly, and your hips ripple, which makes people even more touched. What am I touched by? I am touched by the fact that in the past, there was foot-binding, and now there are high heels. Sacrificing the body for beauty is a lament shared by ancient and modern times!</p>
<p>The swaying waist and rippling hips are a phenomenon that attracts attention. Who am I? How dare I compare myself to Mr. Newton, thinking of inventing a theory of attraction like seeing an apple falling to the ground. But with the situation at hand, I have to put in some research efforts. Observation and thinking are scientific methods; investigating things to the fullest extent is the principle of university. So I paid attention to observing anytime and anywhere. The mother of Little Three and the older sister of Little Six did not walk as wobbly and ripply as you do. I exhausted my reasoning, and after some effort, I realized that it was entirely the high heels under your feet that were playing tricks, nothing else. There is nothing mysterious about it.</p>
<p>Things are always like this, wherever there is profit, praise will follow, even if the harm is even greater. Indeed, when you wear high-heeled leather shoes, your body becomes lighter, your posture becomes graceful, and you become charming, endearing, and lovable. The benefits and advantages of high heels are truly insignificant. When it comes to harm, speaking from the perspective of health, there are more than half a dozen, let's see:</p>
<p>The body's center of gravity is completely supported on the toes, and the heels cannot exert force, making it easy to fall.</p>
<p>When encountering uneven or sunken ground, if you are not careful, the ankle joint is prone to sprains, leading to other diseases.</p>
<p>The organs in the pelvis, especially the uterus, will change their position due to this, leading to more diseases.</p>
<p>The pelvis can also change shape, which can cause difficulties during childbirth.</p>
<p>The traction of the calf muscles and the muscles of the soles of the feet gradually weakens, and the ankle joint loses its original activity.</p>
<p>The bones of the feet sink, and the soles of the feet come into complete contact with the ground, forming what medicine calls flat feet, which sometimes requires surgery.</p>
<p>The first two items can happen at any time, and the following can only succeed after wearing them for a long time. Vanity often blinds reason. You would never be willing to wear completely flat shoes. According to the report of the German doctor Sommer, heels within four centimeters high - what Shanghai shoe stores call semi-high heels - are still harmless to health and do not detract from beauty. Heels that are outrageously high, why is that necessary?</p>
<h3>Just as Unhealthy:</h3>
<h3>The Worldview of Tuberculosis Statistics (9)</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The importance of mandatory examinations for young children has already been noted in countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Poland.</p>
<p>In addition, there are numerous reports on large-scale examinations in the United States. Ferguson believed that 2-3% of university students had tuberculosis. However, the tuberculin test showed 85.6% positivity, and medical students showed 93.6% positivity. On the other hand, researchers such as Herman, Baet Jer, and Doull found that examinations in various universities showed 60% positivity, and sometimes only 35% positive tuberculin reactions. Among these, students with negative reactions turned positive by the end of their third academic year. Based on this observation, these figures are highly unpredictable. Nevertheless, such large-scale examinations are most valuable for early diagnosis, allowing students to receive early treatment.</p>
<p>Observations of tuberculosis in adults show a significant relationship with occupation, with doctors and nurses being the most susceptible to infection. There are research reports from Germany, Sweden, Denmark, France, the United States, and other countries regarding occupation and transmission, but the results are inconsistent. For example, among nursing students in Belgium, only 24% to 30% were infected at the start of their training, while 100% were infected by the end of their studies. Even within the same age group, the mortality rate for nurses is higher than that for ordinary women. Therefore, the risk of tuberculosis transmission is very high for nurses, and female nurses with positive tuberculin reactions are less likely to develop the disease than those with negative reactions. Reports from the United States show that 6-7% of female nurses develop the disease during their training period.</p>
<p>Is tuberculosis an occupational disease for nurses? This question was raised by Kreuser at the annual meeting of the German Lung Disease Physicians Association. He conducted detailed research on recent reports and statistics on nurse mortality and morbidity. Based on various observations, he concluded that nurses are not infected at a higher rate than ordinary working women. However, it is undeniable that this particular occupation is more dangerous than other ordinary occupations.</p>
<p>Regarding statistics on women, Hofbauer-Flatzeck stated at the Tuberculosis Memorial Day conference in Charenton-le-Pont that the tuberculosis mortality rate for women has been lower than that for men since 1890 or 1900. The high mortality rate for men is attributed to occupational factors. During wartime, the statistics for both men and women were almost equal, but afterwards, the mortality rate for women was lower than that for men again. The reason for this difference is not entirely clear. However, the dual burden of managing the household and facing work pressures has a significant impact on the occurrence of tuberculosis and poses a problem for tuberculosis prevention.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the decrease in tuberculosis mortality is a result of prevention efforts. However, the peak transmission rate in large cities is 62%, and among industrial and textile workers it is 51%, with women workers accounting for 20-25% of these cases.</p>
<p>Statistics from England show higher mortality rates for people in occupations involving the inhalation of large amounts of dust, such as shoemakers, garment workers, and mine workers. According to research by Arnould in Belgium, the tuberculosis mortality rate for coal miners worldwide is lower than that for other people of the same ethnicity.</p>
<p>Mortality Rates from 1921 to 1923</p>
<p>Coal miners aged 15 to 65: 10.1 (per 10,000 people)</p>
<p>Rural workers aged 15 to 65: 7.6 (per 10,000 people)</p>
<p>Other occupations: 13.0 (per 10,000 people)</p>
<p>Mercury poisoning is also highly related to tuberculosis statistics. From 1917 to 1926, the mortality rate among Italian mercury mine workers was 52 per 10,000 people, 50.7 for their families, and 31 for other nearby residents. Mercury is a toxic substance that causes chronic poisoning and wasting, making workers and their descendants more susceptible to tuberculosis.</p>
<p>According to various statistics, colored mine workers in South Africa initially experience acute and severe symptoms, but the disease becomes milder when patients return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Statistics from tuberculosis clinics in northern Italian cities show that 6% of men and 5% of women over the age of 60 have tuberculosis, and many of these cases are open, posing a significant danger to their families. At a minimum, young children should be isolated.</p>
<p>Regarding statistics on open tuberculosis in Germany, Brauning multiplied the annual mortality statistics from tuberculosis clinics by three. For example, in 1932, the mortality rate in Germany was 7.5 per 10,000 people, which multiplied by three equals 22.5. Based on the national population, this amounts to 146,250 people. According to recent clinic reports, there were 18.3 cases of open tuberculosis per 10,000 people between 1930 and 1931, with an average lifespan of two years. According to Soellinger's research, approximately one-third of all infections occur within families. It takes more than four years to eliminate this source of infection before the risk of disease decreases in the family.</p>
<p>Barnes' statistics from the United States are similar to Brauning's. According to his report, the average lifespan for people with open tuberculosis is 36.72 months.</p>
<p>Statistics from clinics in Russia show that the lifespan of tuberculosis patients is one and a half to two years. This comparison shows that the situation in Russia is worse than in other countries.</p>
<p>Another question remains unresolved: what causes latent tuberculosis to erupt in certain individuals? Is it a re-eruption of the initial lesion, a superinfection, or a combination of both? This type of research is of great importance in understanding the transmission of the disease. In 280 couples, one person in each couple died from tuberculosis. However, only 6.6% of the other partners contracted tuberculosis, with a mortality rate of 5.5%. Sale's research on 1,100 couples showed an infection rate of 10.54% and a mortality rate of 5.54%. Arnould reported 10%, Opie reported 12.65%, Minnig reported 16.8%, and Simon reported a mortality rate of 18.8% and an infection rate of 22.4%. Kellner's research showed that only 3% or 1.73% of married individuals with open tuberculosis infect their partners. These disease statistics are already very high compared to the disease statistics for the entire population, being ten times higher than average. It is also worth noting that male patients are more likely to infect their healthy wives, while the reverse is rare. The reason may be that women have pregnancies and childbirth, or that the increased infection rate is due to caring for sick individuals.</p>

<h3>Medicinal Plants of National Origin (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Honeysuckle Family Caprifoliaceae</p>
<p>1. Honeysuckle Lonicera japonica, Thunb.</p>
<p>(Plant) Grows naturally in the mountains and fields by roadsides, a climbing vine with dense brown soft hairs all over. Leaves are opposite, with short petioles, oblong, and blunt-tipped. In early summer, long, funnel-shaped, deeply lipped flowers emerge from the leaf axils, initially white, then turning yellow. Berries are small, spherical, and black when ripe.</p>
<p>Honeysuckle leaves are evergreen and do not wither in winter, hence the name. Its flowers can be sucked for nectar, which children like. It is also known as "Gold and Silver Flower" because its flowers are both yellow and white.</p>
<p>(Medicinal material) Honeysuckle Herba Lonicerae is collected from its stems and leaves and dried. Commercially available products are generally sold in short pieces of 2-3 cm in length, and those with more leaves are considered to be of good quality.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver Flower Flos Lonicerae is made by collecting its dried corolla. This product is a pale yellow or yellowish-brown, long, funnel-shaped, lipped flower, about 1.5-2.0 cm long, with a 4-lobed upper lip and 5 stamens attached to the flower throat. There are also mixed flower buds, which are club-shaped, densely covered with brown fine hairs, and have an astringent taste.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The main component of honeysuckle is tannin, which is about 8%. Its general analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>Nitrogenous substances 1.8% Tannin 8.06% Ash 7.66% Dry matter soluble component 43% Water 7.8%</p>
<p>(Medicinal use) Old saying: Honeysuckle has a diuretic effect. Gold and Silver Flower is the same. It is also made into "Honeysuckle Wine", which can be used for washing tumors.</p>
<p>Prescription example: Decoction of Gold and Silver Flower for washing tumors.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver Flower, Sophora flavescens, Zanthoxylum bungeanum, 15.0 each</p>
<p>The above is made into a decoction of 600 for external use.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>The nasolacrimal duct is the necessary pathway for tears to be sent from the small lacrimal ducts into the lacrimal sac and excreted into the nasal cavity. I have already explained this in detail with diagrams in the previous issue of this publication. However, this nasolacrimal duct can sometimes become narrow or blocked, leading to various symptoms. There are generally four known causes of narrowing or blockage. Namely:</p>
<p>Nasal Cavity Diseases—Among nasal cavity diseases, the ones most likely to cause narrowing and blockage of the nasolacrimal duct are nasal polyps and turbinate hypertrophy. Because they can directly compress the nasolacrimal duct, causing it to narrow, or even become blocked.</p>
<p>Eye Diseases—For example, when there is trachoma on the conjunctiva of the eyelid, the inflammation can often affect the mucosa of the nasolacrimal duct. The lumen of the tube thickens as a result, and the secretion gradually increases, resulting in narrowing or blockage of the nasolacrimal duct.</p>
<p>Periostitis—Can also cause narrowing or blockage of the nasolacrimal duct.</p>
<p>Trauma—Same as above.</p>
<p>The symptoms of nasolacrimal duct narrowing and blockage are that the patient develops tearing. Tears cannot flow down through the nasolacrimal duct, causing them to accumulate in the lacrimal sac. At this time, if you press the lacrimal sac with your finger, the tears can flow backwards into the eye from the small lacrimal punctum. This condition is called lacrimal sac weakness. Sometimes the lacrimal sac gradually expands, forming a cystic mass protruding from the skin surface, which feels fluctuating when touched. This condition is called lacrimal sac hydrops.</p>
<p>The most appropriate treatment for nasolacrimal duct narrowing and blockage is to use a lacrimal duct probe. First insert it through the lacrimal punctum, then through the small lacrimal duct and lacrimal sac, and reach the nasolacrimal duct. A small-sized probe must be used first. After the nasolacrimal duct gradually expands, then change to a larger size. If this method does not work, the lacrimal gland can be removed. If lacrimal sac hydrops has already formed, then a lacrimal sac excision can be performed. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to the cause of the disease. If it is caused by nasal cavity diseases, it is even more important to treat them first.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (91)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Methods for killing tuberculosis bacteria have been described above. In addition, patients with this disease, when undergoing treatment, need to pay close attention to many things in order to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria in sputum and in the sickroom, and to prevent the danger of tuberculosis bacteria spreading; these things may seem trivial and excessive, but in fact the gains and losses are very great, and everyone should know them well and follow them consistently. The details of these rules are now excerpted below:</p>
<p>Sputum must be spit into a sputum pot, and the sputum pot should contain carbolic acid solution; do not let the sputum dry. It is best to discard the sputum in this sputum pot in the toilet.</p>
<p>Any sputum that cannot be spit into the sputum pot should be spit into a piece of paper or a handkerchief; cover the mouth with it when coughing. Used pieces of paper or handkerchiefs can be collected in a designated paper box and burned.</p>
<p>The tableware used by the patient should not be managed in the same place as those used by others. Rinse with boiling water each time before washing; it is even better to put them in a pot to boil and disinfect.</p>
<p>Two basins should be prepared in the sickroom or adjacent room, one filled with water and one filled with a common disinfectant solution. The patient must wash their fingers thoroughly each time before eating. The caregiver must wash their hands once after picking up the sputum pot or other dirty objects; even if they have not picked up objects, but only leave the sickroom, the same applies. The hand should first be disinfected with soap and water, and then with the solution, to be completely clean.</p>
<p>Wipe miscellaneous utensils with carbolic acid solution. The sickroom should be cleaned by wiping with water instead of sweeping (to prevent the risk of tuberculosis bacteria spreading); it is even better to wipe the floor with carbolic acid solution.</p>
<p>Useless books, handkerchiefs, shirts, and inexpensive items should be burned. Handkerchiefs, shirts, bed sheets, etc. that need to be reused should be put into a designated large pot immediately after use, collected, boiled for ten minutes, and then washed.</p>
<p>Items that are difficult to disinfect using the above method, such as books, suitcases, wooden objects, etc., can be exposed to sunlight for several days.</p>
<p>The sickroom should be exposed to sunlight as much as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to disinfect the entire room after the patient moves out, you can use formalin spray disinfection.</p>
<p>Generally, there is no danger to subsequent residents of a room where a patient has lived for more than half a year. If strict disinfection procedures have been followed, it can be used after only one or two months. (The above ten rules are roughly based on the "Pulmonary Disease Prevention and Treatment Teaching Rules" written by Japanese scholar Hara Sakae.)</p>
<p>The methods for disposing of sputum coughed up by patients, as well as the strict disinfection procedures for furniture and utensils in the residence, have been described above. In addition, the patient's feces should also be disinfected in the same way as the sputum disposal method. This is especially important to not neglect in those with complications of intestinal tuberculosis and kidney tuberculosis!</p>

<p>The epidemic diseases in Shanghai are scarlet fever and smallpox in the spring, dysentery and cholera in the summer, typhoid fever and malaria in the autumn, and meningitis, diphtheria, and measles in the winter.</p>
<h3>Hygiene During the Rainy Season</h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>Entering the rainy season, the humidity in the air increases and the temperature also rises, which is the best opportunity for mold to grow. All kinds of bacteria are scattered in the air, and indoor appliances, clothing, etc., are all attached to them. These bacteria cannot multiply without a certain temperature, humidity, and nutrients necessary for development. From winter to spring, they shrink due to the cold and dryness. Once it reaches the rainy season, they suddenly gain momentum and begin to multiply and run rampant. Among them, the ones that we can see with our own eyes are molds. These are filamentous bacteria that exist in the air, and what people can see with their eyes when they attach and multiply is the collective group (colony) of them. The nutrients of bacteria are the same as those of humans, requiring protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, salts, etc. Even very small amounts are sufficient. Therefore, even if there are very few nutrients attached to clothes and appliances, they can develop and multiply countless bacteria.</p>
<p>Since the food of humans and bacteria is the same, and in this season, even very small amounts of nutrients can develop a large number of bacteria, it is only natural that various fungi grow vigorously on our daily food. It is not without reason that infectious diseases that enter the body through the mouth along with food are also prevalent during the rainy season.</p>
<p>These dangerous pathogenic bacteria, although of the same type, are different from the completely harmless molds mentioned above. The group (colony) they form cannot be seen by the human eye, making them even more difficult to deal with. In addition, when various bacteria develop on our food, the bacteria themselves do not directly harm the human body. However, when they develop, the food must be decomposed by them. For example, carbohydrates (such as grains and sugary foods) will ferment, and proteins (such as meat, eggs, and milk) will rot. When these decomposed products are ingested by the human body, the human body will be harmed. We know that foodborne diseases (food poisoning) are most common during the rainy season, which is an example of this.</p>
<p>During the rainy season, temperature, humidity, etc., are not only suitable for the growth of bacteria, but this time also coincides with the breeding period of terrible flies. These flies constantly carry bacteria from the location of molds to our food, needless to say. Under today's circumstances, hygiene facilities are still not fully equipped, and the disposal of feces, urine, and dust is not complete. Therefore, the occurrence of flies is also a natural phenomenon. Although the public has become slightly more aware of this recently, it is still difficult to achieve complete eradication.</p>

<h3>Financial Matters Mostly Settled, Gold Prices Finally Fall Back, Ministry of Finance Declares No Impact</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was initially firm due to the Ministry of Finance's announcement of a new currency system plan, which slightly stimulated sentiment. Later, due to large investors seeing flat prices and mostly settling their positions, the exchange rate market also gradually declined, resulting in a hovering. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw slight decreases in spot and forward silver prices in London and New York. News reported the Ministry of Finance's announcement of a new currency system, with some people thinking it was good news. However, considering the reality, our country's silver currency has completely detached from its intrinsic value and is based on exchange rates. It is fundamentally difficult to estimate pricing based on the silver market, so the gold and foreign exchange markets should be more stable. Therefore, many large investors took advantage of the high prices to sell. The Central Bank's announced exchange rates were unchanged for both British and American currencies, and the customs gold unit was unchanged. The standard gold price rose to 1140.5 yuan. The over-the-counter preliminary transaction opened, although at 43 yuan, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Tong Taichang, Yicheng, etc. all sold, immediately retreating into the 40-yuan range.

The registration price for June was 1135 yuan, and for July it was 1139 yuan. The water subsidy in the morning was 1135 yuan, and in the afternoon it was 1134 yuan. The bare gold price was 1141 yuan with an additional two yuan. The spot market situation was stable and lacked activity. Tianjin goods were quoted with an additional eight yuan, and cooked bare goods were quoted with an additional seven yuan. Initially, Qingfayong gave Xiangfeng 280 strips at a price of four yuan, but later, Yuanchangyong, Dadecheng, Dachangxiang and others had appetite for additions, and the price was reduced to 3.6 yuan. This price was given by Shengyuanyong to Yuan Maoyong for seven strips, and Dadecheng for twenty-eight strips, at 3.6 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Briefly Rises in the Middle</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the government's renewed talk of restoring silver, but whether it is related to the public debt market, and how the interests are involved, opinions vary. In fact, the relationship with the public debt itself is solely the abundance or reduction of customs tax revenue. Currently, due to serious smuggling, which affects the foreign debt secured by the first claim on customs duties, people's hearts are therefore weakened. To raise prices to previous levels, many parties feel crowded. At present, it is in the midst of a gathering storm, and due to the harshness of the environment and situation, it is filled with anxiety for merchants, and the future is difficult to be optimistic about. Yesterday's slight rise was only a local perspective, mistakenly believing that the currency system declaration was beneficial to public debt. Yesterday's course, the opening in the morning, initially weak then firm, the second session initially firm then weak, showing the confusion of people's hearts. The opening in the afternoon once rose, and the closing fell again. This truly shows that various parties' hearts, for various new measures, have not yet been able to identify and understand. The result of the day's market price, although still slightly better by 5 cents to 35 cents, observing the successive sales of numbers 4, 11, 47, and 72, many parties' selling memories have a gradually avoiding appearance.

<h3>This City's Cotton Stock Shows Increases and Decreases</h3>
<p>Survey on May 16th</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Can Still Be Maintained</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions, due to the Sino-US monetary agreement issue, after the authorities made a clear statement, people's hearts gradually returned to stability, the rise and fall of yarn and cotton were very slight, the market lacked stimulating news, the market price was sluggish, and sales could only be maintained. Shantou was better. Yesterday, more than 100 pieces of ramie yarn, poplin, fine cloth, foreign yarn, and printed cloth were continued to be handled. The Sichuan gang transported a large batch of colored cloth, and continued to purchase it yesterday, with transactions of Five Tiger brand modern blue cloth, priced at 7.7 yuan, Dongfang Dagang brand and Zhisheng brand gray twill, priced at 7.65 yuan, Yuantwill and Qiuxiang twill, priced at 7.95 yuan, and Mingjing blue cloth priced at 9.2 yuan, and other goods in more than 50 boxes.

<h3>Grains: Spot Flour's Quoted Price Turns Lower, Standard Recent Term Wants to Rise But Is Powerless</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month showed a good appearance, with little rise or fall in the quoted price of foreign wheat. However, due to different considerations of long and short positions on the currency issue, based on the past situation, it was inevitably beneficial to long positions, so the opening price was once soft, and then gradually rose. The closing price for June was 3.08 yuan, and the forward price generally rose by 3 fen or so. Forced to open in the afternoon, the situation slightly changed. Although June is the handover of new and old, spot sales have been very deserted recently, and the current situation is more supply than demand. For example, the quoted price of spot flour has dropped to 3.25 yuan, a drop of 1 jiao from the previous day. Therefore, the hearts of people in June suddenly became soft and flat, and as a result, it was 7.5 li less. As for each month in the distant future, because non-industry still has pull-in, the trend is still agreed. Observing the later situation, it is feared that due to the loneliness of spot sales, the market will naturally fall.</p>
<h3>Too Much Rain, Futures Wheat Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month generally showed a stable state, with very little rise or fall in foreign wheat, but the weather could not be clear, and there was inevitably a feeling of too much rain. Transactions in each month were difficult to be smooth, and prices were raised by 3 to 5 fen. By the time the afternoon opened, the initial opening was good again, and it was raised by another 3 to 4 fen compared to the morning. Later, because short positions increased and it was rumored that the distribution of spot flour was very deserted, people's hearts were empty again, falling back by 2 to 3 fen from the initial opening. The spot wheat market, because factory demand is normal and flour sales are sluggish, so the quoted price has fallen by another 2 fen, with the opening of Shandong Yaowan, Suzhou, and Xuzhou wheat at 4.61 yuan, totaling 2,800 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>American wheat, the market is generally matched by the May period, which expires on the 26th of this month, and the price is feared to have no hope of a big rise.</p>
<h3>New Rapeseed Has Already Been Opened</h3>
<p>Although new rapeseed has not yet appeared, in previous years, Toyo has already started to do futures trading in March and April. The total amount of this kind of futures transaction must be in the hundreds of thousands of bags every year. This year, due to abnormal weather, continuous overcast and rainy weather, the harvest has been greatly affected, so its market price has risen from 7.45 yuan to 8.4 yuan, and the number of transactions has only been around 50,000 bags by last weekend. And the customers who run this business and traffic in it still dare not offer it. Yesterday, it was heard that 2,000 bags were traded on Sunday, and the price of Wuhu goods was 8.45 yuan, and the market rose by another 5 fen, still ordering transactions in June, July, and August.</p>
<h3>Thin Rice Sales Activate, Market Price Returns to Good</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten numbers arrived from various gangs, (a total of more than 3 stones of goods). The sales market on this street is still bland. Da连 and 青岛 gangs are willing to buy more than 2,000 bags. Therefore, the thin rice market has returned to a few cents to nearly a jiao. The fresh early japonica is set and moderately weak, and the Duyangjian and Yinyuan are flat.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 11 and 2 numbers of arrivals from various gangs in Hexia. Due to the cloudy and rainy weather, there are not many goods listed by the shops, resulting in a sluggish way out. The market price of white japonica is 67 cents less, the price of thin rice is a few cents to a jiao less, the price of Yangdujian is also 56 fen less, the price of Yinyuan is nearly a jiao less, and the price of Buxian is a jiao less. The prices of other goods are all seeing a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Passenger Indica's Outward Path Is Slightly Active After Depreciation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of passenger indica continued from the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang. Although the number of arrivals is, but the local base is insufficient. The market continues to remain soft and sluggish as rice shops are eager to sell their rice. Yesterday, the weather was cloudy and hot, and the owners of rice in the market were generally unable to hold their rice for long, and most of them were depreciated and sold. Therefore, the price of various rice continued to fall by 35 fen. After the price fell, the digestion was flexible, and the market was stable again. It was heard throughout the day that 4,550 bags of Jiangxi rice and 925 bags of Wontai rice were sold. Except for a few embellishments of passenger indica, all were handled by this street.</p>

Therefore, people's hearts are tired, so the Nansuzhou oil market fell to 28.5 yuan in late last month, and the Bengbu oil fell again to 28 yuan, with a total of 1,340 halls traded. Since this month, raw materials have gradually become loose, and soybean oil has also fallen, resulting in a more unstable situation. Buyers and sellers have been waiting for half a month, and finally, the Huaiyuan goods fell to 26.3 yuan the day before yesterday, a huge drop of 1.7 yuan compared to the previous intention. A total of 200 dan, or more than 700 halls, were traded, and they were handled by this street sporadically. Temporarily, due to limited sales channels, the market is seeing a steady state.</p>

<h3>Northern Goods: Longkou Noodles Open Down 1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Longkou 糸粉 dried, recently, due to sparse sales, the arrivals are still lacking, but because it is not a sales season, the market is suddenly tired. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 100 bags of customer goods were offered, and the price was 23 yuan, which was 1 yuan less than the previous session. The market price (92 skin) was sold for 23.5 yuan, and the next was 23 yuan, and there was also a trend of slack. The back market is temporarily difficult to rebound due to the sluggish relationship in the stomach.</p>
<h3>Shantou Tangerine Cakes Are Quite Short</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrivals of tangerine cakes have been rare, but because there are not many walking places, such as Xiamen and Wenzhou goods, they are weak and unstable. For example, Xiamen soft cake numbers are opened sporadically, and it is another 5 jiao less than before. The number of Wenzhou cakes with less movement in the stomach continues to see a downward trend. Ordinary sales are only 19 yuan, and the higher ones are called 20 yuan. However, the number of arrivals in Shantou cakes is limited before, and it has been sold out. According to the letter from the producing area, because the shipments are also lacking, the prices are tight, so the later batches will also arrive, and there is also a sign of rising.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sea Jelly Head Skin Has Little Stock</h3>
<p>Sea jelly, also known as jellyfish, has no silk and no bones, floats and sinks in the water, and travels with the tide. It develops extremely quickly. It is produced in Daishan, Yangshan, Qushan, Sijiao, Huanglong, Liuheng, Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, and Yantai in Shandong Province. New ones come out every June until September. The amount of production is abundant, and the sales market is also wide. For example, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi all have huge sales. Goods are better in Yangshan Daishan, and Wenzhou Yantai are secondary. At present, the business of various routes has not yet started, and the stock on the street is not abundant. Therefore, the market is in the middle of two sides. The market sells, the original price of Yangshan jellyfish skin is 9 yuan, and the rewritten price is 9.2 yuan, Sijiao goods 8.6 yuan, other grades are out of stock and there is no market, jellyfish head three-year old goods, selling price 7.5 yuan, two-year old 6.5 yuan, last year 5.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Prices Fell Sharply Yesterday</h3>
<p>Recently, Yokohama silk market has been falling frequently. Yesterday, the spot silk price fell even more sharply. Yesterday, the spot selling price opened at 675 yuan, a drop of 20 yuan from the previous day and a drop of 90 yuan from the beginning of the month. The futures opened at 670 yuan, a drop of 8 yuan from the previous day and a drop of about 70 yuan from the beginning of the month. New York was closed yesterday, and Lyon Qinghe was as usual. In this port, only Bilahua Foreign Firm slightly purchased silk yesterday, for a total of 10 packages of white factory B-character 13.15 bar shares, priced at 660 yuan.</p>
<h3>After Uncustomed Woven Finished Products Arrived: The Artificial Silk Market Suffered a Great Blow</h3>
<p>The 120-character Tianqiao brand, few uncustomed goods arrive at the port, and the price has risen slightly. Yesterday, it was reported at 318 yuan, but the delivery was sporadic. The Hangzhou and Suzhou gangs came to Shanghai yesterday to purchase 120-character Tianqiao brand customs-labeled goods, a total of more than 20 boxes, priced at 321 yuan. A silk factory in this port purchased 10 boxes of 75-character Sini Aier number 2 glossy, priced at 490 yuan, 15 boxes of 150-character Tianqiao brand, priced at 370 yuan, and several boxes of 100-character Flying Lion brand matte, priced at 410 yuan. A Japanese foreign firm is selling 50 boxes of 75-character Golden Rooster brand matte, priced at 233 yuan excluding tax. The goods are scheduled to be fully loaded in early June. The goods will also enter the meter tomorrow, but they were ordered by the local font in the past. More than 60 boxes of European goods will be transferred to Hong Kong within the day because the customs warehouse is due and they dare not pay taxes. Because a large number of uncustomed woven finished products from North China, Tianjin, Gaoyang, Jinan, and Zhoucun continue to arrive, the prices have gradually fallen. Now, the threads of the foot-headed pattern have fallen by 3 jiao per yard, and the matte spinning has fallen to 7.56 yuan per bolt, and it is still difficult to sell the goods. As a result, the silk factories in this port have stopped working. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will strictly crack down on smuggling and detain or pay taxes on the uncustomed woven products from the Jinpu Road. Otherwise, the silk factories and artificial silk market in this city will all collapse.</p>
<h3>New Tea Sources from Various Routes Are Abundant</h3>
<p>In the past two days, new red and green tea from various routes have been shipped to Shanghai one after another, becoming more and more abundant. Qimen black tea, imported from Hangzhou and Changshao, has been transported to 4,000 boxes, and another 3,400 boxes will arrive in Shanghai within the day. Goods from Ningzhou Tonggukou and other routes will also be transported in large quantities in the near future. Suian Tuzhuang green tea has 3,000 boxes. According to Zhuan'an news, the head of this route will be fully shipped, and it is expected to be transported in the near future. And the foreign-made green tea produced and sold by Ningbo, Huzhou, Wenzhou, Xinchang, Shangyu, and Pingshui in Zhejiang Province is even more continuously transported to Shanghai. The new head goods of Tunxi and Shexian will also be transported within this week, and the market situation is becoming more and more lively.</p>
<h3>Suian Core-Pulled Zhenmei Opens</h3>
<p>Suian core-pulled Zhenmei green tea was continued to be opened yesterday by Tongfu Foreign Firm for a new price of 114 yuan. The way out for Tuzhuang core-pulled goods is not lonely. However, the wholesale goods of the Luzhuang and Tuzhuang routes are still not very good due to the depreciation of the franc and the thick base of Morocco. Observing the current market situation, goods with excellent water quality and leaf bottom are still easy to sell. A total of 398 boxes of Zhenmei needle eyebrows, shrimp eye and other green teas, and Bailin Wenzhou black tea were traded throughout the city. The market price was lower than before, ranging from 12 yuan to 4 yuan.</p>

<h3>Quack Doctors and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xu</p>
<p>When a person gets sick, he must hire a famous doctor to treat him: after the results of the examination are considered very dangerous, logically speaking, since that doctor has identified the source of the disease, and also knows that if he wants to quickly relieve the chronic disease, he must use a rapid and aggressive dose of medicine. However, that doctor, in view of the patient's serious illness, and that the disease is ultimately on the patient's body, and even more afraid of hindering his own reputation as a famous doctor, then prescribes a painless and innocuous Taiping decoction for the patient to take. But the disease becomes more and more serious every day. Finally, alas, returning to where he came from. The above situation is called "quack doctors kill people."</p>
<p>Because quack doctors can kill people, and associated with this war in Abyssinia. After Abyssinia contracted the disease of Italian aggression, it went to ask that League of Nations chief doctor to diagnose and treat it. But the League of Nations chief doctor knew that the origin of this Abyssinia disease was very serious and very dangerous, and a heavy dose of medicine had to be applied to Italy. But in the end, because Abyssinia's illness was ultimately harming the Abyssinians, he was afraid of damaging the prestige of the League of Nations chief doctor himself, so he helplessly used a magical-like remedy of sanctions. In the eyes of the chief doctor, he felt that this wonderful medicine was applied very satisfactorily. But in Italy's view, it was still painless, and Abyssinia, who was terminally ill, only saw it become more and more serious every day. As a result, he tossed and turned on the bed, eking out another seven months and fourteen days, and finally the national fortune was reduced. An active Abyssinia independent country was ultimately merged into Italy's territory. All of the above is called "League of Nations."</p>
<p>Wasn't our country once afflicted with a serious illness of the "September 18th Incident" five years ago, and also invited that League of Nations chief doctor? Until now, how is the disease ultimately, alas, only I myself know.</p>
<h3>The Flower of May</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>The flower of May... speaking of this term, how much does it excite people? It is a flower, it is a flower of May, it is the flower of May in this early summer, so full of strong stimulation!</p>
<p>The rose is so beautiful and also contains a rich fragrance. But the fragrant and beautiful rose has thorns, which is the strong stimulation of the flower of May. But the rose is a flower of May, and the strawberry is also a flower of May. The strawberry flower is also so beautiful, and at the same time, it has no stinging thorns. But it also has no fragrance. No thorns, no fragrance, this is the strawberry flower, not as stimulating as the rose. Although the rose and the strawberry flower are both flowers of May.</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. Xu, whom I haven't seen for four years, suddenly came from the ancient capital of Beiping last month, looking dejected. I asked about his recent situation, and he suddenly burst into tears and said, "Old friend, the flower of May has stung my heart!"</p>
<p>It turned out that in these four years, he had been wandering in the old capital, and his life was extremely miserable. But in the miserable material life, his spirit had a very meaningful nourishment: a girl whose life was as miserable as his. Because of their similar circumstances, a sprout of love grew.</p>
<p>The girl's father was a man of knowledge tormented by famine. Seeing his daughter growing as beautiful as a rose in May, he had long planned to rely on this rose for the rest of his life. Therefore, he tried his best to destroy the love flower that was brewing between my friend and his daughter.</p>
<p>The May storm finally conquered the flower of May. The old man transplanted the rose in front of the courtyard to the back garden. The reward my friend received was a letter of severance stating, "Limited by strict orders, ... no future meeting can be expected." Inside was also enclosed one hundred rose-colored letter papers that my friend had written over the past three years.</p>
<p>My friend suffered a great wound from this. He said, "From now on, I no longer hope for roses. I want to be friends with strawberry flowers forever, and be permanently intoxicated in strawberry flowers that have no thorns and no stimulation. My heart has already suffered a serious wound, and there is no hope of recovery from this wound!"</p>
<p>Oh heavens, the "flower of May," stimulating and hurtful, or not hurtful and unstimulating, my friend has deeply tasted it.</p>
<h3>Niao Na Spring Breeze Scores Bamboo Branch</h3>
<p>— A Wan</p>
<p>"Bamboo Branch" is the name of a Music Bureau poem, originally from Ba Yu. Like the Wu songs, it has a harmony. Yang "Bamboo Branch" is to take a beat, and then girls sing in unison. During the Yuanhe reign of the Tang Dynasty, Liu Yuxi sided with Wang Shuwen and was demoted to Sima of Langzhou. He created more than ten new lyrics, which were sung by all the Yi commoners of Wuling. After that, it became popular in various places. All those who used seven-character quatrains to sing about local customs and trivial matters were called "Bamboo Branch Poems."</p>
<p>My friend, Brother Mengyuan, is the eldest son of Mr. Jin Songcen, a famous 吴江 resident. He accompanies him as a tenant in Suzhou and likes to knock out rhyming verses, privately studying with Suiyuan. He collected the anecdotes from the Wuwang Terrace and composed them into "Bamboo Branch Poems," which were published in the Mingjing edited by Mr. Fan Yanqiao, and his reputation filled the literary circles. Over time, he accumulated a hundred poems, which he entrusted to Liju to publish. Liju is the name of a famous female lawyer from Wu, Shi Kaiyuan. Soon, once this compilation is released, the paper will be expensive in Luoyang, and those who love to talk about the wind and moon of Xutai can even recite it by heart. I wrote two quatrains for him: "How many vicissitudes have there been in the land of Gu Su, with its deer? The remaining traces of flowers and the moon enter the brocade bag; How many Bamboo Branch songs have you chanted, the brilliant whisk handle is filled with fragrance." "The old tune of Ba Yu belongs to the daughters, remember how the guests initiated new lyrics; Now that the orioles are singing in Maoyuan, the Niao Na spring breeze scores the Bamboo Branch." Furthermore, I have gathered two quatrains by Ding Chang Goude: "In recent years, the flowers and plants of Suzhou are cold, and I worry about my frugal belly and high talk; Luckily, I wave my whip and chant good lines, a small autumn in the southeast." "For three lifetimes, flowers and plants have soaked in Suzhou, red is lovesickness, green is sorrow; There are other words of weeping before the wine, the pearls and jade of scholars in the voices of daughters." Therefore, the vast writings of Liu Binke cannot monopolize the beauty of the past.</p>
<h3>Swapping the Phoenixes' Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Fragrant Grass and Beautiful Women Gently Entrusted by Ripples - Sweet Dreams Warm for the First Time in a Small Building on a Moonlit Night.</p>
<p>The sun is not like a human being, willing to linger a little. While Guoqi was constantly lost in thought in that deep alley, the sky had gradually turned dim, and it was about to get dark. Not far from here, leaning against the base of the city wall, were two ancient temples. At this moment, the clang of two or three bells was sent to the ears. Along with the sound of the bells, he raised his head and looked, only to see two or three crows flapping their wings and flying across the sky. Suddenly, he thought of Li Pingshan's appointment. He had been too careless. He immediately strode towards Li's house. Fortunately, the road was not long, and he arrived in about ten minutes. From a distance, he saw Pingshan walking back and forth in the alley at the entrance of the door with his hands behind his back. As soon as he saw him, he immediately ran forward, shook his hand, and laughed, "You have always been a man of your word. Why are you so late today?" Guoqi smiled and said, "I'm really sorry. When I left the school gate, I thought of coming here immediately, but I didn't expect that something would happen on the way..." As he spoke, he reached out and touched his face, looking hesitant. Pingshan said, "You must have met a friend on the way and been dragged to the teahouse for tea." Guoqi shook his head and smiled, "I don't have that habit." As he spoke, he followed Pingshan into his house. Pingshan had also tidied up a small study, moving the tables and chairs neatly. In the vase on the desk, a bunch of fresh monthly roses had been inserted. The Yixing pottery tea set had also been washed clean without a trace of dirt. Next to the vase, a finely bound poetry rhyme with annotations was placed, with a paperweight made of smooth white stone on top. In the large bowl of Qingcai fine porcelain, many multicolored stones were soaked, and the water was so clear that there was no trace of dust. Guoqi looked around and smiled, "Looking at you, you seem to have the intention of brewing tea at home to wait for guests." Pingshan said, "Of course. Look, the stars should be showing in the sky. I'm still waiting for you to go to the North Pole Pavilion to admire the moon?" I thought you must have been pulled away by a colleague to play chess. Guoqi sat down on a chair by the desk, casually picked up a book from the bookshelf and flipped through it, and smiled, "Anyway, I was delayed by something. Why do you have to ask?" Pingshan smiled, "If that's the case, I have to ask even more. Could it be that my brother had a romantic encounter?" Guoqi didn't answer him, just kept flipping through the book. Pingshan smiled, "Oh! That's if my words are not proper. My brother is an honest scholar, how could this be? But then again, today I saw a short story called "Joyful Reunion" that you wrote in Chunhua Magazine. It's really well written. I suspect you really had such an experience." Guoqi laughed and said, "I didn't write such a piece of writing." Pingshan said, "Isn't your signature Hua Feng?" (23)</p>
<p>People's Sketches</p>
<h3>The Recluse of West Lake</h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>I once hated Qiantang, but the official duties were light, and I couldn't resist the mountains, so I became interested in them day by day. After …, I even visited those who were reclusive among the monks and those who hid their bodies in this country, and talked about the joy of washing their mouths with millet and rinsing their mouths with spring water. During the time of the Western Chu, the rich … Ping …, Fang also drifted along with his colleagues, … in solitude, and increasingly guided each other. Chong Ping followed the wandering of Mr. Qu …, Zhuang Fu received the scriptures from Xia Ling Cen, with a unified origin, and his friend traveled on the lake, searching according to the tracks, so they escaped Zen from the world and even got to know six or seven of them. However, it is still unknown what kind of person the recluse Wang Qianji of Nanping is? I recruited Qianji, but it was never completed. At that time, the monk Jingyu was in charge of Hupao, and he invited me to drink in late autumn. We got drunk and spent the night, and the morning breeze blew us back. My tongue was dry and cracked. Passing by the Cangshui Temple, I saw a wide … on the left side of the road and hurried in to beg for tea. Three sides of the lake window, one floor of wind and five shadows, with the remaining lotus welcoming, and the ghost Wan serving and calling. The host was a white-haired woman, courteous and respectful to the guests. Her words were brilliant, and she seemed to be a member of the hermit community of Shihu? I asked her, and it was true. She claimed to be surnamed Wang, driving cattle in Guilin, and the end was like five battles. I asked if she was worried about the lack of daily resources? She said, "The hair of birds and animals can be woven, and their leftover grains can be eaten to be full? My husband is not less than Han Kang, and I steal to learn from his business." I asked if I could see him? She said, "He has not yet returned from entering the mountain." … people …, disappointed for a long time! … Xun Xu Qi, Qing … Liu …, Fenf Ji … Jian, except for a painting of red plums, which brightly illuminates …. Near Lian, a young child was lying on the table, concentrating, looking straight ahead without surprise. … the poem was not even half finished. Thinking that both the daughter and the mother are so pure, what kind of person is the old man who is killing time? A gourd of cause and effect, hard work is stolen and dreamed, but the visit is ultimately fruitless, nearly four battles. The guest will have something to do in Nanchang next year, taking the road of Wulin, respectfully informing him in advance, begging him to wait for me in the setting sun of Nanping; and when the deadline arrives, the car is taken, together with Meng Jiao, carrying fat snow, knocking on the secluded house, white hair and pale …, shaking hands as old friends. He led me to the top of the listening bell tower, and the tea conversation was like drawing …, which could not stop. He was asked that birds and animals cannot be with the same group, so why do you live here with such pleasure? He said, "When I was young, I passed the township examination, and when I was strong, I crossed the ocean. I focused on studying Western learning and should have peeped into its general outline. At that time, I didn't want to put what I had learned into practice and describe it: but being an official does not necessarily require learning, and learning may not necessarily fit with politics, the sun and the moon do not wait, and the old will be cut off? The Book of Changes says, '… and not seen, the journey is simple and has not been completed,' what is the measure of today, how can we imitate the people of Ju …? I will confess that my final life is not successful; and selling … to earn a living is not completely outside of the world. "The gentleman is sixty-three years old, his voice is loud like a strong man, and he is asked what he has practiced? He said, "It is from upholding the scriptures, and the heart does not run outside, so the essence and energy are drinking inside, so the inner classics are consistent, guiding people to …" He released the Netora Sutra, saying, "The words of the Buddha are the words of the people, and those who are strange are confused." They all send people to places that have not yet arrived. At that time, the wind was more severe, and the clamor was getting more intense, … hoping to moisten the heart … the shadow, being dragged by the jade … Branch, in the space between existence and non-existence; looking at the room …, the fire was burning fiercely, and I felt surprisingly warm. Occasionally, when I mentioned poetry, the gentleman claimed that the youthful habits had all disappeared, and only the old wife … Yun (Wang) and my daughter Zhenfen still enjoyed doing it. I published the collection of poems by his daughter: there are sentences such as "Collecting medicine in the mountains is also to heal the country, why bother to hope for glory to the cauldron clock?" "Except for being quiet, there is nothing else to do, a volume of golden scriptures and seven bowls of tea." "There is no sound of cars and horses outside the door, and people live in the style of Tao Yuanming in Xunyang." The style of a family is almost complete. The gentleman's name is Qianji, and his other name is Qing'an Lay Buddhist. When discussing his life, reading Li Chuan Yuan's couplet can reveal the general meaning. The postscript says, "In Xin Chou, I was the examiner in western Guangdong. When I returned through Wuchang, Zhang Wenxiang congratulated me on finding talented people, and first recommended Qianji, saying that he was a talent for managing the world: but Qianji was indifferent to official progress. After traveling to the West, he became a doctor. The Book of Changes praises those who were bored before the fat …, who are those who are as subtle as this person?</p>
<h3>Inscription for Tianlu's Painting</h3>
<p>— Hu Huaichen</p>
<p>Old man Zhuzhuang, Shangguan Zhou. It is said to be a hermit of the early Qing Dynasty. A son who loves books refuses to work. Occasional strokes are like gods. This picture is suspected to be a self-portrait, one foot bare, head without a scarf. Looking up and sitting steadily with a volume in hand, how can there be Han and Wei people in his eyes! Vulgar people do not love it very much, so that the ink treasure has been buried for a long time. Today it is suddenly obtained for Tian …, and the encounter is also due to previous causes. I wish Jiao cherishes and protects it carefully, lest the old man in the painting should turn into a god and go to heaven.</p>
<p>(Note) The painter signed the inscription himself.</p>
<h3>Dragon Coiled Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>— Yan Yinquan</p>
<p>The warm spring breeze, one gust after another, blows the bamboo shoots buried in the ground, one branch after another, making them show their heads!</p>
<p>Therefore, I also remembered the story of eating Dragon Coiled Bamboo Shoots last year. Bamboo shoots are a natural product, but these Dragon Coiled Bamboo Shoots are entirely man-made. So we might as well call them "Man-made Dragon Coiled Bamboo Shoots"!</p>
<p>The method of making this kind of bamboo shoot is extremely ordinary, but if you don't go to the home of relatives in the bamboo shoot producing area, you won't be able to obtain it even with a thousand gold coins!</p>
<p>As for the method of making it: put a clay jar over the bamboo shoot that has just emerged from the ground, and then use dozens of pounds of stones to press the clay jar tightly, allowing it to slowly grow inside. Finally, the bamboo shoot grows crookedly in the jar!</p>
<p>When eating, you only need to turn the jar upside down and dig it out. Any method of cooking is fine. The quality is tender and the taste is endless! However, the villagers are superstitious about the word "sin", and the mountain owners only make two or three branches a year, so they are reluctant to easily entertain guests with it.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Dance School</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Following my friend into the dark Hengtang, turning corners and alleys, I was wondering, "Am I being led into hell?" When suddenly my friend turned his head and said, "We're here, we're here."</p>
<p>It was a dilapidated small Western-style house. In front of the mottled white-painted glass door, a wooden sign was erected, with an advertisement written on red paper: "Dance Art Convention tonight, practice tickets twelve yuan each, complimentary fragrant tea, ×× Dance School." In the corner of the courtyard, it was covered with tinplate. My friend asked, "Do you need to pee?" I shook my head.</p>
<p>So, with a confused mind, I walked into the house. A gentleman with long hair and a navy blue suit invited us to sit on a half-sided canvas chair. There was a tea table in front of us, and a gentleman with old-fashioned glasses and a snuff-colored long shirt brought two cups of tea. There was even a small coin-like "coat tag." Irregular Arabic numerals "35," I was surprised that such a small place had so many people.</p>
<p>The four walls were covered with blue cloth curtains. Each corner was lit with oily green lights, like ghost eyes, filled with a sense of bewilderment. Around the rectangular smooth floor sat women, women, women… Each woman's face was like being made of lusterless white mineral powder, set off in the dim green light, and the area without rouge formed a deathly gray. Here there were shop assistants in flannel robes, here there were fake gentlemen in mandarin jackets, young men in suits and women with unbuttoned collars, some inferior perfume, some stimulating tobacco smell, some rude words and teasing. A soul-stirring tune was broadcast from the amplifier, rushing at the dozens of couples who were swirling like ghosts. There is never daylight here, never a clear mind…</p>
<p>"Dance as much as you want, enjoy it to the fullest, isn't one yuan twelve times!" These words were passed over from the next seat. I saw those women wearily lying on the men's shoulders, their eyelids rounding, their bodies tightly hugged, being pushed. This is life, like mud. "Am I being led into hell?" I looked suspiciously at my friend.</p>
<p>Mail forwarding: To Mr. Qiu Feng in this city and Mr. Guo Moji in Nantong: Mr. Yi Junzuo's "White Gate Heart Shadows" is published by Banyue Society of Qinyi Building, Qingyun Gate, Zhenjiang, priced at one yuan and forty cents, plus one for postage.

<h3>Tianjin Hosts Respect for the Elderly Meeting</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>According to yesterday's report, the Tianjin Third Popular Library held a respect for the elderly meeting on the 17th, with 82 elderly men and women attending, and more than 100 guests. Mr. Ye Guilin, 63 years old, performed singing, and Mr. Fang Jinrong, 83 years old, performed boxing, and so on. Recently, the initiation of respect for the elderly meetings has been common everywhere. Places such as Shanxi, Sichuan, and Guangdong have all had such a set of tricks. Now, it can be said that the elderly are having good luck.</p>
<p>The elderly are indeed respectable, because these elderly people have mostly come from their youth. Ordinary people cannot live to be forty or fifty years old. They have actually lived to be seventy or eighty years old, or even more than a hundred years old. This kind of longevity is certainly not a small blessing. However, the respectability of longevity must be accompanied by conditions. Longevity must be valued by health. If one is long-lived but unhealthy, it is like being a living dead. The long-lived must be valued by having done a great career in his youth. If one has no achievements and is mediocre throughout his life, he is just a good-for-nothing. What is so valuable about it? Longevity must also be valued by having many blessings. If one is long-lived but lacks food and clothing and is poor and miserable, then longevity is not as good as short life. Just like in the late Qing Dynasty, there were many elderly people who held bamboo sticks, wore yellow coats, and begged from door to door, seeking food to survive. These were all elderly people who had been respected by the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, respecting the elderly is not as good as taking care of them. People nowadays, not to mention the old and the young, cannot survive. Even young people, without jobs to seek, without a way to live, often implement passive policies, trying to die to end themselves. It can be said that this happens every day. If an elderly person cannot maintain his life, his hardship will be ten times greater. This is because an elderly person's muscles have weakened, his spirit has declined, and there are no more jobs to seek. Therefore, the government, knowing that the elderly are respectable, should find ways to take care of them, such as building nursing homes, so that the elderly who have no one to turn to, or who are poor and have no way to survive, are all taken in. This is slightly more meaningful than a meeting to respect the elderly. Otherwise, calling on many elderly people and asking them to sing and box is like child's play. This is making fun of the elderly, not respecting them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason why our country's elderly people can live so long, ask them, it's really inexplicable. They don't really understand the art of "immortality" and have attained Huangdi's longevity. I have asked several elderly people, some said I eat less, but I am always quiet and dare not persuade, some said I can eat a whole hoof every meal and walk thirty miles every day, so more eating and less eating, more movement and less movement, also depends on physiological needs. It is not that one can live long by eating less and moving more.</p>
<p>Only one thing I can be proud of is that the world today has become a world where fathers are not fathers, sons are not sons, brothers are not brothers, and younger brothers are not younger brothers. Not to mention other people's elderly, they are not in the eyes of young people. Even one's own parents are like guests, like strangers. This kind of situation, some say that the world today should be like this, some say that no matter what, the kindness of upbringing cannot be forgotten. Although I dare not criticize the above two statements, I always feel that the former statement is somewhat unnatural, somewhat strange. I don't know what the average young people think?</p>
<p>The proverb says, "Treat my elderly as I would treat the elderly of others." The meaning of the current respect for the elderly meeting can be used to contradict this, saying, "Let the elderly treat me as they would treat their own elderly." Its effect is only like this.</p>
<h3>National Gate</h3>
<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>At dusk, the tide came. Standing on the deck, looking at the brilliant lights on the top of Victoria Peak, the dream of returning home made me even more intoxicated.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the noisy voices seemed to weaken. With the long whistle of the steamship, the ship slowly moved. The square warehouses on the pier and the towering buildings behind them, the golden dragon-like reflections on the sea, the complex sounds of people, everything, all gradually moved away, further and further away. Looking through tearful eyes, Hong Kong seemed to be covered with a layer of light sand, or seemed to be falling into the gray twilight.</p>
<p>The ship left the Lei Yue Mun, and in front of me was the blue sea and the blue sky, connected in a line every day. I stood blankly on the deck, and the early summer sea breeze searched for the heat on my body. Below the ship were crazy waves, which seemed to be sobbing and roaring. A wave was thrown over, hitting the hull, and it shattered, turning into countless white foams, which were thrown behind the ship. This scene, this majestic sound, was too familiar to me. For the past half month, since the day I left Singapore, I had been listening to this plea that seemed to sympathize with the travelers, while enthusiastically dreaming of the motherland. Now the sea journey is coming to an end, and tomorrow, the tomorrow that I have been looking forward to for several years, I will throw myself into the arms of the motherland.</p>
<p>Most of the people on the ship were asleep after the anchor was raised. The deck was deserted, with only an old couple from Chenghai and a little girl left. They were silent, staring blankly at the high sky and the vast sea—the sky and the sea were melting into one in the twilight—suddenly, the little girl said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Mother, will we arrive in Tangshan tomorrow? Will Uncle San come to pick us up?"</p>
<p>Her mother nodded and said nothing. She looked into the distance, where a moon had just slipped out of the clouds, and the silver light was pouring on the sea.</p>
<p>"Mother, Mother, are there "Boli" (i.e., police) in Tangshan? Will they check the ship?" the child asked again.</p>
<p>"Good girl, go to sleep. We'll arrive in Tangshan tomorrow. There are no "Boli" in Tangshan."</p>
<p>"How passionately people returning from foreign countries love their Tangshan, their motherland!" I thought to myself. Now, I feel particularly young, my heart is blooming with May flowers, and even breathing is free. The arrogant eyes and scoldings of noble foreigners, the powerful and barbaric fists and feet, the slave chains and iron laws, are now like those foams, flowing weakly, flowing away, further and further away.</p>
<p>"We have a motherland!" Returning to the cabin, even my dreams were of the motherland, and I felt proud.</p>
<p>The next morning, as soon as I got up and looked out of the porthole, it was no longer the boundless sea. The ship was sailing smoothly along a wide river channel. The water was turbid, and the small waves stroked the hull with yellow hands, whispering to us as if to say, "Welcome back, dear brothers." I felt very excited. I ran to the deck in one breath. The two banks were low dikes, covered with forests of lychee and longan trees. The forests were so dense that I could only see the low thatched huts and the compatriots going to the fields through the gaps. Further on, it seemed to be vast, with yellow waves rising and lying rice fields.</p>
<p>"This is Humen." A person standing beside me told his companion.</p>
<p>"Ah, Humen! Humen, the national gate of our South China!" I whispered to myself.</p>
<p>In the distance, among the green leaves, there seemed to be a national flag fluttering, but it was covered with a layer of morning mist, and I couldn't see it clearly.</p>
<p>Now I have finally arrived in Tangshan, and my hometown, which I have been missing all the time, will arrive immediately. I feel an inexplicable excitement. I hurried back to the cabin. While I was packing my luggage, the companions next to me asked me:</p>
<p>"Old buddy, when you go to the provincial capital, come to my house for a sit-down if you have time."</p>
<p>I nodded silently. But another thought attacked me: although my beloved Tangshan has arrived, how will I solve my livelihood?</p>
<p>I sat blankly on the bed, and my eyes couldn't help but feel a little moist.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Dad bought a new little bed, painted white, with bars on all four sides that could be raised and lowered, and a curtain hanging from hooks above. That evening, after reading the evening paper, Dad held the little baby and asked, "Does precious baby like the little bed?"</p>
<p>The little baby had a rather large foreign doll, a gift from his uncle. Mom had specially knitted a set of small woolen sweater and pants for it. The little baby loved that foreign doll very much. He asked Dad to buy a little bed for the doll, and although Dad had promised a few times, he always disappointed the little baby. Now, when Dad asked about the little bed, the little baby jumped up in Dad's arms, clapping his hands, imitating the little star in the movies, and whispered into Dad's ear:</p>
<p>"Little baby likes it. Little baby wants the foreign doll to sleep in that bed."</p>
<p>Dad smiled and hugged his body, lifting the little baby over his head. He told Mom what the little baby had said.</p>
<p>Mom was sitting at the table by the window, sewing new summer clothes for the little baby with her head down. Hearing what Dad said, she smiled and put down the clothes in her hands, walked to Dad, took the little baby, and kissed his tender red cheeks, asking, "Does little baby want to sleep in that little bed?"</p>
<p>"Little baby wants to sleep with Mom," the little baby shook his head, "The foreign doll sleeps in that little bed."</p>
<p>"Good boy," Mom said, "Little baby, listen to Mom and sleep in that little bed with the foreign doll."</p>
<p>The little baby still shook his head, "Little baby is scared, tigers and flies will bite little baby."</p>
<p>Dad and Mom both laughed.</p>
<p>The little baby often wanted Mom and Dad to tell him stories. Dad had told him a fairy tale: before eating, you should wash your hands. One child didn't wash his hands and ate the fly eggs left on his hands.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The fly eggs hatched inside his stomach, and many small flies were born, which bit the child to death. Mom told a story about a tiger. In a certain mountain, there was a tiger that liked to eat children. At night, it would often listen stealthily under the window. If there was a child who refused to sleep, it would climb in through the window and snatch the child away. That's why the little baby was afraid of tigers and flies.</p>
<p>"Mom and Dad are here, little baby don't be afraid," Mom said, kissing his cheeks again, "Good boy, sleep in that little bed."</p>
<p>The little baby turned to look at Dad. Dad said,</p>
<p>"Sleep. Mom is going to have a little brother. Little baby can't sleep with Mom anymore."</p>
<p>The little baby looked at Mom's slightly bulging belly. He asked Mom, seemingly understanding but not really, "Mom has a little brother in her belly?"</p>
<p>Mom nodded, carried the little baby to the newly bought little bed, took off his clothes, and after the little baby was settled in, Mom said, "When brother is born, will you sleep together?"</p>
<p>The little baby replied happily, "Little baby wants to sleep with brother."</p>
<p>From then on, the little baby often remembered that Mom was going to have a younger brother. He treated the foreign doll as his younger brother, hugged it, and slept with it. He also often looked suspiciously at Mom's belly and asked, "Does Mom really have a little brother in her belly? Why doesn't he cry? Doesn't he want to eat cookies?" So Dad told him:</p>
<p>"Little baby didn't cry or eat cookies when he was in Mom's belly either. A child needs to stay in Mom's belly for ten months before he can be born. Mom will have a younger brother in the second half of the year. Does little baby like younger brother?"</p>
<p>In this way, the little baby often asked how much time was left until the second half of the year?</p>
<p>But when summer just arrived, the little baby felt that Mom and Dad didn't like him as much as before. Dad was either going out in the morning and coming back at night, or he was often angrily sleeping in bed. Sometimes he would go out for a while and come back for a while, but he never brought cookies home. When the little baby wanted Dad to hold him, he always got snubbed. Mom secretly told the little baby to be good and play by himself. Dad didn't have any business, Dad was unhappy.</p>
<p>When he was playing with the foreign doll alone, he thought, wouldn't it be great if Mom gave birth to his younger brother soon and he could play with him? He often paid attention to Mom's slightly bulging belly.</p>
<p>One day, Mom got sick, shouting and screaming in bed. Dad paced back and forth in the room, smoking cigarettes, and didn't even notice that he had knocked over the spittoon. Dad didn't eat that day, and the little baby also sat hungry in the corner of the room. He didn't dare to speak. He remembered those scary things, tigers and flies.</p>
<p>After a few days, Mom got better and got out of bed, but when the little baby looked at Mom's belly, it was deflated and there was nothing there anymore. The little baby looked at Dad's angry face, and he threw himself into Mom's arms, wanting Mom to hold him. He felt that he had seen many strange things these past few days, all of which he didn't understand. He leaned close to Mom's ear and asked:</p>
<p>"Did Mom have a younger brother?"</p>
<p>Mom just kissed his cheeks without answering. Mom started to cry, and tears flowed down and hung on the little baby's cheeks.</p>
<p>That night, Mom slept with the little baby again. Dad pushed the little bed into the corner of the room.</p>
<h3>Grandma Gengchen</h3>
<p>— Shidai</p>
<p>There was still half a month before the pilgrimage to the Holy Mother Temple on Piechou Mountain, but the village was already sounding gongs. Based on experience, everyone knew that the gong sound was for "urging the payment of association fees."</p>
<p>On the first day of the fourth lunar month, the entire "Ten-Household Association Leaders" were dispatched, carrying household registration books to collect association fees door-to-door. This was a matter of respecting the gods, and no one could refuse to pay. The year before, Ju Er-cheng didn't pay his association fees or go up the mountain to offer incense. Didn't he die of a sudden illness after only two months? Who didn't say that was "retribution"?</p>
<p>The pilgrimage and festival to Pieh Mountain was on the sixth day of the fourth lunar month, but on the fourth day, each district in the surrounding countryside had already begun the festival "processions" (note). High-stilt troupes, firecracker whips, short-stick troupes, lion dances, flags, umbrellas, and fans were arranged in long formations, going from this village to that village, with gongs and drums filling the sky, and the joy made everyone forget their fatigue!</p>
<p>When the festival procession left the village, the women got busy, pasting ingots, making festival costumes, and cutting paper flowers. Small sundry shops were crowded with people. Incense foil, yellow paper, and five-colored paper were flying around. The shopkeepers were covered in sweat and couldn't even find time to smoke or drink water. People were constantly coming and going at the street entrance. Incense paper flowed out of the door, and money flowed in. The shopkeepers who always complained about losing money couldn't help but be "secretly happy that business was so good!" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>People of Suzhou (3)</h3>
<p>— By Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Jinghong: Are even the useful men of Suzhou free from the flaws you mentioned?</p>
<p>Liya: In terms of occupation or moral concepts, useful men of Suzhou are generally better than useless men of Suzhou. But I have never liked the people of Suzhou, whether they are men, women, pitiful old men, old women, or children. As long as they are from Suzhou, I only have negative feelings towards them, not positive ones.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Do you have a grudge against the people of Suzhou?</p>
<p>Liya: Not only do I not have a grudge against them, but neither does anyone in my family.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Then why do you hate the people of Suzhou so much?</p>
<p>Liya: I hate the people of Suzhou for being "gluttonous and lazy"! Have you not seen that Suzhou is full of confectionery stores that encourage consumption? Have you not seen the refreshment shops on the streets of Suzhou? What is most detestable is the Suzhou people's "love of dressing up". Family eating problems are minor matters. As for what they wear, it must be silk and satin. So people say of the Suzhou people: "They wear silk on their bodies, but have no rice for dinner at home"! Because of this kind of ironic saying, I think they should change their bad habits a little bit. Who knows that they cannot change the Suzhou people's inferiority, so I hate them to the core!</p>
<p>Jinghong: Miss Jin, don't be too intense! Being too intense may offend people!</p>
<p>Liya: I have always had the temperament of a Northerner. I say what I want to say and do what I want to do. As for offending people, that's another matter entirely. Anyway, you're not from Suzhou. Criticizing the people of Suzhou in front of you, I don't think it will offend you, right?</p>
<p>Jinghong: Do you know where I'm from?</p>
<p>Liya: Of course, you're from Beiping, right?</p>
<p>Jinghong: I'm really not from Beiping.</p>
<p>Liya: Even if you're not from Beiping, you definitely wouldn't be from the South, because your physique, complexion, personality, attitude, and demeanor are completely like a Northerner.</p>
<p>Jinghong: You're really too straightforward! Although we've only been friends for three days on the ship, I've already considered you an old friend. If I don't consider you an old friend, then from today onwards, I will no longer be friends with you!</p>

<p>Opening Excerpt: "Jia Baoyu Visits Xiaoxiang Pavilion at Night"</p>
<p>Severe winter, cold dew turns to ice. The moon's color is hazy, about to fade. Gusts of north wind penetrate the bones. The pitch-black Grand View Garden is desolate and quiet. Baoyu walks along Flower Street. The night is late, people are quiet, and no sound is heard.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>He continues forward. Alone, he goes to Xiaoxiang Pavilion to see if Sister Lin's illness has lessened. He lightly knocks on the copper ring, the sound dripping. Someone quickly comes to open the door. Zijuan hears and asks, "Is it truly Second Master who wishes to enter?" She hurriedly opens the door. "Please take care, the cold of the deep night is unforgiving." "Thank you, sister, for your kind concern. I will never forget your great kindness. It is only because I am worried about your Miss Lin that I come quietly at this late hour." He arrives at the bedside. He sees her gasping, tears streaming down her face. One moment she calls for Sister Lin. Another moment she calls him her cousin. Her almond eyes open slightly, unable to see clearly. "Cousin, your second sister-in-law treats me too harshly. Her words are wild and create right and wrong. Although Grandmother loves me, I am pitiful and cannot go to pay my respects." "My past debts with you have been settled in this life. Please do not look at this ill-fated person anymore." "Sister, cast aside all your worries. Do not belittle yourself too much. I advise you to eat three meals a day. Wear more clothes to keep warm. I advise you to sleep early at night, not too late. Drink more medicinal soup. I advise you not to listen to the words of the sisters. They seem real but are false, like a drama. I advise you to take care of your health and protect yourself. Do not think of your old home in Yangzhou." Hearing these words, tears stream down. "I am most grateful to my foe. Cousin, please return to Yihong Courtyard early." The tears wet the fragrant silk handkerchief. "This life may not be too drifting."</p>

<h3>Lido and Jincheng Simultaneously Screen Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times"</h3>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times," which caused a sensation in Shanghai, is now being screened for a second run at the Lido and Jincheng theaters. This fifth artistic work that Chaplin himself considers his most satisfying has been rumored for five years. When it was released, it broke any box office or audience world record. After that, it is unknown when Chaplin's new work will be available for viewing. However, this time, Lido and Jincheng are screening "Modern Times" to give preferential treatment to customers and are not raising prices, which is truly a once-in-a-lifetime piece of good news for movie fans. Then, you must not miss this last chance.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>Lianhua's first dialogue sound film, "Waves Washing Sand," will be released in Shanghai soon. Along with this film, there will also be Wu Yonggang's comical short film "Sleepless Night."</p>
<p>Liu Na'ou's screenplay for "Eternal Smile" has passed the preliminary review.</p>
<p>"Eternal Smile" will be directed by Yang Cun and star Hu Die.</p>
<p>Fei Mu and Shen Fu's joint script for "Cold Moon Wolf Smoke Record" has a grand and novel theme. Fei Mu is currently busy dividing the scenes and filming will begin at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The short comedy "Sleepless Night," which is scheduled to be released at the same time as "Waves Washing Sand," stars Han Langen, Liu Jiqun, and Yin Xiucen, the three treasures.</p>
<p>"Sleepless Night" features an exhibition of all previous aviation lottery tickets. This valuable prop was borrowed from Lao Zhao.</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang, starring in "Begonia Red," has filmed several scenes under the direction of Zhang Shichuan. Bai Yushuang's performance is very steady, and it is inevitable that there is a slight stage flavor, but this strengthens her unique style.</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoqiu serves as assistant director for "Begonia Red."</p>
<p>The gunboat built in the factory for "Go to Nature" is extremely grand and spectacular. Sun Yu said, "With this gunboat, China can have nothing to fear when the Second World War comes."</p>
<p>When Han Langen was filming "Sleepless Night," his young son Shaolan was also watching the fun. Seeing a scene where Han used both hands to cling to the upstairs window and hung his feet in the air to make a screaming performance, he cried loudly until the filming was over. Han then kissed and comforted him, truly creating a "comical family scene."</p>

<h3>"Black Sea Cleansing Record" Released</h3>
<p>"Black Sea Cleansing Record" tells the story of a giant thief who specializes in stealing insurance. He was sentenced to five years in prison, where he was persuaded to study industry. He learned diving skills and later, when salvaging a sunken ship, he heard from a friend that there were gold coins hidden in the safe on the ship. He used his old skills again. When he went underwater to explore, he took the opportunity to hide. The shipowner knew about it but did not want to publicize it. Finally, he discovered his conscience and returned the gold coins to their original place. He won the favor of a university girl and got married. The plot is very profound and has a unique style. It is indeed a rare Soviet film. The entire film was shot underwater. The underwater treasures are dazzling. The film is now being screened at the Shanghai Grand Theater.</p>
<h3>Gao Lihong's New Play</h3>
<p>What is Gao Lihong's new play after "Flowers and Plants"? According to the publicity draft, it is "Money Tree" and "Floating Clouds." Yes, these are the titles of the plays that Hong Shen proposed for Gao Lihong's new play. However, now, Hong Shen reluctantly gave up the two play titles. Although everyone thought the title "Money Tree" was very good. The reason for giving up is because of early publicity. According to past circumstances, if a script that has not been submitted for preliminary review is publicized in advance, the film inspection committee will order the play title to be changed when filming is completed, and by that time, all publicity will be in vain. Therefore, Hong Shen decided to propose another play title, which has been determined but is not convenient to announce. The script itself is being written. Zhang Zhenduo's role is probably heavier and Zhang Fei's role is slightly lighter. The content also depicts the petty bourgeoisie. As for the play title "Money Tree," it may be used again in six months.</p>
<h3>"Metropolitan" Fourth Issue Published</h3>
<p>The fourth issue of the "Metropolitan" weekly magazine, edited by Ye Xinhuan, was published on the 16th and printed with heavy-weight Daolin paper. The cover of this issue is the heroine of "Spring Dreams in Neon Clothes" Lian Bangsi; the content includes: Chen Zizhan "My Poems"; Geran "Names of the Metropolis"; Huai Huai "Reflections"; Wu Zhongliang "Hesitation Heart"; Chen Sheng "About Sai Jinhua", Zhao Jingshen "On Love, Desire and Morality"; Black Infant "On the Freight Train"; Hu Chun "The Emerald Screen" comic strip and so on.
