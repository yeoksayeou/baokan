<h3 id="c58">西班牙政府遷都以後 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>西班牙內戰自從爆發以來。迄今已將有四月之久。最近隨着西政府的遷都凡倫西。亞叛軍的重重包圍瑪德里。內戰的發展已到了極重要的關頭。西政府的防守瑪德里戰爭。雖有驚天地泣鬼神的英勇的表現。但此危城之將陷落叛軍之手。恐不過是時間上遲早的問題。在西政府遷都凡倫西亞與叛軍攻入瑪德里之後。西班牙的內戰前途。將有怎樣的發展呢。這是極可注意的問題。</p>
<p>先就對內方面說。西政府的放棄瑪德里京城。並不能表示內戰的卽將完結。這於西政府在新都舉行第一次閣議後所發表的宣言中。已說得很明白。「我們的遷都凡倫西亞。並不能表示我們的放棄瑪德里。也不能表示我們的退讓。我們的遷都正是為要調整各　防守瑪德里京城的力量」。同時西班牙駐法大使館也發表同樣的宣言。謂眞正的戰爭。目前方在開始並引述一九一四年大戰時德軍迫近巴黎。法國政府暫時遷至大西洋岸的波爾多城。繼續應戰。卒乃轉危為安。易敗為勝做例子。說明「西政府現已决定效法當時法國政府之政策。採取外錢包圍之戰術。至獲得最後勝利而後已」。我們不但從西政府的正式文吿中。可以推知西班牙的內戰不會因瑪德里的失陷而終結。卽從現政府所處的地位說。內戰也不會就此終止。却反有更趨激烈的可能。因為現在西班牙的西部土地。雖多已淪入叛軍之手。而沿地中海的富庶之區與其他工商業重鎭。如比斯開桑湯特阿斯都里加泰隆薩孔多凡倫西亞等省都還在政府的手中。政府仍有與叛軍作最後决鬥的能力。同時擁護政府的民衆。是法西斯叛軍的死對敵。他們絕不會不戰而降。因為他們深知在叛軍統治全國之時。也就是他們死亡之日。所以從上面幾種情形看。來西班牙的內戰將隨政府的遷都而更踏入激烈的階段。</p>
<p>至就對外關係說。則瑪德里城陷落後。將發生重大的影響。而使環繞於西班牙內戰的國際鬥爭更趨銳化。我們都知道西班牙叛軍的背後。有着意德等國的援助瑪德里的陷落也可說是德意攻下的將來叛軍進駐京城組織新政府以後意德葡三國之將卽予承認那是沒有疑問的黑衫首相的代言人蓋達氏已於八日意大利日報的評論中說「西班牙國民軍政府卽當由歐洲最富於理智的某某國政府予以承認」這所謂最富於理智的某某國政府。自然卽係意德等國政府至英法蘇等國雖不會承認叛軍政。府但意德如承認叛軍政府後。就可認它為西班牙的合法政府。而與之發生更密切的關係。他們甚至會公開供給叛軍政府的軍火因為他們可以說。這是國際公法所許可的。這與現在西班牙政府所受的不公平待遇正相反對。自必引起嚴重的反響。所以此後西班牙事件的國際糾紛。必將隨着瑪德里的陷落而益加增重。</p>
<p>我們觀察西班牙內戰的發展形勢。不能不想到現在國際禁運軍火辦法的不當。不干涉協定把西班牙合法政府與叛軍一樣看待。這非但違反國際公法而且不合情理。同樣的國際上對於侵略者與被侵略者。如施以同一的禁運軍火辦法。（如國聯對意阿戰事最初的决議以及美國的禁運辦法）也是違反正義的舉動。處在被侵略者地位的我們。為着將來的本身利益起見。不僅要反對這種不公平的國際禁運軍火辦法。而且也要反對束縛西班牙合法政府的不干涉協定。因為反對那種不公平的不干涉辦法。也就是為增加我們將來抵抗侵略力量的利益着想啊。</p>

<p>— 中國主編</p>
<p>本年七月份，本市工商業，於渡過夏節，及半年結賬期後，又略現轉好之勢，然疲憊不振之現象，猶繼續存在金融業方面商辦銀行與國營銀行間之對立日見尖銳，一部份基礎較弱之商辦銀行多自穩守，緊縮而漸至停滯之狀，故資本集中之現象，愈益顯著，工業方面，幾循直綫下降，鮮有轉好之象，至於居市塲重心之販賣商業及消費事業，雖新創之數字相當可觀，惟倒閉之數字，竟將倍之，且營業未及三四月，卽吿改組或淸理者，更比比皆是，蓋市塲之購買力，迄未增加，而金融之週轉，亦仍凝滯也，至本年八月份，上海工商業在一般衰落趨勢中，尙稱平穩，蓋新創字數，雖呈下降，然閉歇家數之减少，更倍於前者，故相對言之，可爲折轉之象，考其原因，大概有二，一爲本月份販賣商號之異動比較和緩，一爲製造工業且有轉趨興旺者，所差者僅特種事業項下之混亂狀態，反較一前嚴重，今將七八兩月份各項異動之統計，與上兩月（卽五六月）及去年回期者列表比較如次，</p>

<p>指示提倡體育之眞義　打破一般的錯誤觀念</p>
<p>本市市立體育專科學校、於昨日上午九時舉行紀念週時請社會局潘局長將臨演說、大意謂體育卽是敎育、敎育是不問分割的、不特培養智識、同時亦鍜鍊身體、一般人以爲體育足體育學校的人講求的、而體育學校人亦自認是專鬥講體育、對於其他的智識是不必硏究的、因此把敎育的意義分割了、這實在光極大的錯誤、而且一般學校把運動員另眼看待、竟有給以豐衣肉食、功課則較爲放寬、養些運動員來專爲學校開起運動會時來奪錦標這不啻把運動員視爲玩具視爲工具、這亦是極大的錯誤、所以我們要打破此種錯誤觀念、我們不特求身體健康、還要求心理健康、我們雖硏究體育、但其智識亦同樣重視、因爲敎育的意義是要一個人整個的向上、不是單求身體練好就完事、尤其是我們市立體育學校的學生更應認淸此意義、以矯正一般人之錯誤</p>

<h3 id="c200">日本護士事業及護士教育現狀 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 花新人（述）　張警民（記）</p>
<p>經過花柳病科，便可看見許多女人正在受着電療，因爲好奇心的衝動，便向他們內部的醫師詢問病名，這些醫師便詢問護士，更由護士尋到主任，才可知道的。不久，就看見巍峨高崇的大廈，那就是東亞最優美的一所護士校舍，其中設備，非常完美，對於護生的技術試騐處設立得很多：當每個學生入學必須先授以洗浴，電木用具的洗滌法；我們知道日本人不是很聰明的，咖啡總是不會煮。</p>
<p>護士的教育以及關於護士的一切情形</p>
<p>英，美，中，日，一切的教育制度，一切的教育情形大致相同：不過日本的護士教育全由專家分扔任的，取分工合作的制度，不像我國兼甲又兼乙唱獨脚戲似的敎授；這一點敎育方法的確是他們的優點：値得我們採用的，可是他們也有他們的缺點，就是所學非所用，學與用不能打成一片，因此技術不很高明，但是他們對於醫師無論技術方面以及其他公私方面只要醫師有所吩咐，莫不唯命是從取絕對的服從的態度。</p>
<p>東京的醫院</p>
<p>日本稱護士呌看護，以前呌看護婦，至於看護的大名就是以日本爲發祥地，我們對於這個名稱的粗俗顧名思義可以斷定日本的敎育不會超過中國之上的。在東京的境內有兩個最大，規模最大的醫療機關；一爲東京帝大醫院，一爲同仁醫院，此兩個治療機關中除東京帝大外都各附着一個護士學校；兩個護士學校，當然一爲同仁醫院護士學校，一爲東京帝大附屬護士學校；其中同仁護士學校，比帝大護士學校，房屋富麗，經濟充足；因爲同仁醫院是由各國人士所協辦，規模旣偉大，經濟亦甚充裕，在東京方面各醫院中爲首屈一指者，其中一般情形，大致同北平協和醫院相同。</p>
<p>同仁醫院中的見聞錄</p>
<p>同仁的一位護士學校校長，曾經對我們說「若平衡中日的護士敎育，當然中國是很進步的，而日本所以不進步的呢？有三大原因，一日本人不會洗盤子，二不會洗浴，三不會煮咖啡，然而中國人呢？確可稱得拿手好戲云云」照她所說的一番話，其中實在含有許多譏刺的義意，難道中國人專會做這下賤的事嗎？未免有點過甚其詞，不近事實罷了，至於日本人的三不會或許是有的，這是當我們在參觀同仁醫院時的事。</p>
<p>日本護士的出路很好，例如公共衛生方面，醫院護士方面，以及私人診所等。談到一般人民衛生敎育的程度，當然是比中國高，照理推測，日本的衛生設施無疑的也高於中國，可是事實適得其反，中國衛生設施比日本來得完備。至於日本護士入學稈度高小畢業就行，受學期間爲三年半，所有上課的情形遠不及中國；可是各個護士間比中國護士間非常團結，宛如一個團體：所以當我們走到各街上，就可看見有看護會的標幟高揭在行人蒼萃之所，若有醫院需用護士就可同該會接洽，而該會由失業者的時間長短，分別介紹，有時或登報徵求外界的錄用。</p>
<p>在現在我國非常時期中，日本政府特別的注意護士敎育，差不多每個人民都要經過這個階梯，並旦現在護士敎育，戰時急救都被列入國防敎中，定爲每個人民在護十敎育期間必修的課程，如果我們詳細分析日本的護士敎育，從表面上可以一目了然，他們的程度很低，但實際所做的工作很大，很多；是着重於實際的。</p>
<p>全東京的護士從以前到現在，只有過兩個男護士，都充當精神病護士，至於要男護的原因，一社會背景，二經濟狀况，三社會需要。有時許多護士過剩，有時護士不够應用，這種供求不相應的現象，日本是罕有的。</p>
<h3 id="c201">輸血解釋（上） <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣益生</p>
<p>十月五日申報載袁律師提出建議請律師公會呈部解釋輸血是否犯法一文，抑富扶貧，一以生命健康爲重，用心未嘗不善；然不明底蘊，純以個人之情緒，率爾而言，竊有議焉。原文要點有二（一）凡被抽血之身體，抽血以後，立卽危害康健，自願受傷，無異自殺，敎唆或帮助他人自殺行爲有罪。（二）買血賣血，在病者方面，毫無實益，縱使有益，其目的在使富者壯而貧者弱，富者生而貧者死。（中略）—偶遇病人失血過多，爲避重就輕計，選擇其同宗族中之同等血液輸救，泰西各國固有此例，惟絕對不許以此事營利。茲爲逐項解釋如左：</p>
<p>（一）（甲）成人之血液量，平均爲四。五公升輸血量的二〇〇至八〇〇立方公分（西西）輸血者之損失，於數小時內，完全恢復，决不至於發生貧血以致危害康健：蓋血液之新陳代謝，在平時故生生不息，小小損失後，製血臟器，感受刺激，工作加快，出產允速。</p>
<p>（乙）輸血之條件：。（子）輸血者方面：絕對無損害輸血者之健康，而有益於受血者之病體：所以體格檢査須絕對嚴格，（一）年靑體壯毫無傳染病之嫌疑，方爲合用。（二）血型鑑別之審愼，血型配則受血者迎合無周，不配者牛凝集反應，轉瞬死亡。（三）輸血者血型明矣，體格合矣，旣在醫院登記矣，允須善保其壯健，蓋血型爲有生以來一定不變者，而壯健未必能一定不變，舉凡戕賊壯健之事當懸爲厲戒，而加意於珍衛，（四）相當期間內，當然不爲屢决輸血。</p>
<p>（丑）受血者方面：醫師純以科學的判斷，認爲有絕對之需要，所謂得之則生，不得則死，如（一）單純急性失血過多，命在呼吸，本身之血液，新陳代謝，實無時間，又少能力，醫師如用生理食鹽水救濟，雖量可增多，而質太稀薄，不得不得不他人之血，起死回生，立奏奇功，（二）疾病而致貧血過甚或（三）劇烈病症非藥物所能救濟時，血之爲用，營養人體之外，同時爲人體對於疾病之戰鬥力大本營，輸血一方增加營養，一方郤可視爲一枝生力軍，本身血液，得些外助，新陳代謝加速，抵抗力加强。</p>
<p>綜合觀之，輸血者絕對無害，而且有益，（一）自己如有暗疾，可於騐體格時知之，而不失醫治之時機。（二）其血型成爲已知，萬一橫遭劇傷危病，立刻變爲受血者，可省去騐血手續，費時而貽誤生命。（三）須善保其壯健，至少限度，不敢去嫖，沾染惡疾，以喪失輸血者之資格，受傷云何哉？自殺云何哉？輕加醫師以敎唆帮助自殺行爲之刑事責任，謂之不合邏輯，羅織人罪，睢曰不宜！余將仿其調曰，輸血爲救命，阻撓輸血，卽阻撓救命，阻撓救命，無異殺人，殺人者有罪。然余决不願作如是言，推原作者之用心，仁厚也而已矣。至於醫院方面，先覓人登記者，受血者之需要，生死關頭，千鈞一髮，有時病情危重，一人輸血，不足救命，須多人分任，再三換人，臨時審査體格，檢騐血型，時間萬不允許，其未雨綢繆之意義，自易了然，或曰子誠好辯，因輸血暈昏者，予在北平聞之矣。余曰唯唯吾吾，此心理作用也！非失血作用也！國人向來重視血液，男子更甚，論女子之心理，應較男子爲脆弱，何以不聞女子見月事而昏暈，司空見慣也，亦未聞健康之女子以月事多决而血枯竭，新陳代謝也，此亦可證明輸血之無害健康，毫無疑義，以重視血液之心理，一朝出賣，初感恐怖，終且悔憤，於是乎可昏暈，且有人焉見自己流少許之血卽致昏暈者。余爲人騐華氏反應，取血祇四西西，而暈者三人，二男子，一女子。</p>
<p>（二）病者之實益：卽就上海一隅而論，各醫院用輸血法，生死人而肉骨者，鐵般事實，有案可稽，原文言「病者方面毫無實益」下文卽緊接一句「縱使有益」袁律師何善用「縱」字至於若斯之妙耶？！推測其下筆時之良知，不能直捷了當，否認輸血之奇功偉績，略略躊躇，乃下一「縱」字妙哉也，「縱拋開輸血本身，而談到貧富，富者富於財而貧於血，貧者貧於財，而富於血，以裕餘而補不足，互受其益，公平正大，衡之以義務權利之義，有何不當？且輸血者救人於垂危之頃，大仁大義，仁義而利，三美俱備，設孟子復生於今日，當無「何必日利」之感慨也。至於泰西各國如何情形，茲略舉二事以證之（一）英美駐滬士兵，自願賣血，往醫院登記者，不乏其人，原作者可往各醫院一査，或竟請求實地觀察，立可證明。（二）我友朱醫師功宏博士，在美國留學時，爲人輸血多决，每决得二十至一百美金，英美軍隊，紀律嚴肅，衛生允重，設輸血爲有害健康，安能容個人之嗜利胡爲　朱醫師體格强健如常，且言「當時亦絲毫不覺衰弱疲乏，美國大小醫院，均有輸血者之名冊」。所云止限於同宗族，及絕對不許營利之說，不知原作者何所據而云然</p>
<p>（三）法律的觀察（甲）輸血間題本身，凡事一方有利，一方蒙害，蒙害者享法律之保障，損人利己者到某程度時受法律之制裁，現受血輸血者者，兩得其利，故輸血問題本身爲合法，毫無疑義。（乙）醫師行使輸血，受血者有益，輸血者無害，安能指爲富所炫重視富者，利用金錢誘惑貧者，乃利用科學之智識技能以救人耳！（丙）原文之法律問題：公然以文字評論人事者，宜一言一語，根據確鑿，何况建議於律師公會，何况呈司法行政機關，何况出於律師之手，更何况爲人命有關之事乎？依科學規律，亦應有根有據而言之。</p>

<p>— 蔣野萍</p>
<p>季節是一個個的轉移，據說今日是「霍亂年」而轉變成「瘧疾年」了！常然我們是不相信預言的兌現，可是夏秋交加的季節，是疾病叢生的時期，這是不可否認，有現實擺在大衆的眼前，過去的證實，當每年夏天的到來，就好像携着疾病與死亡一樣的恐怖。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一零六）由鼻病而來的談話及聲音障礙</p>
<p>我們的呼吸。是有兩種。一種是鼻腔呼吸一種是口腔呼吸。所以鼻腔對於呼吸上。實占重要的部分。同時對於談話及聲音上。亦有緻密的關係。是卽所謂鼻腔的共鳴作用。假如鼻腔內。一旦發生病變。則在發聲時所起的鼻腔共鳴作用。卽可異常異常。它的音調。亦卽著明失去常態。這種失去常態的音調。在醫學上。稱爲鼻調。聲音的障碍。由鼻腔的病變。概可分爲二類。</p>
<p>（一）閉塞性鼻聲—閉塞性鼻聲常見於鼻感冒（俗稱傷風）。肥厚性鼻炎鼻腔內癒着。浸潤。潰瘍。鼻咽腔癒着，及腫瘍等時。它的程度。各有不同。大都由於鼻痛的部位及輕重而異。甚者有時竟可使鼻腔的共鳴作用。完全廢絕。</p>
<p>（二）開放性鼻聲—開放性鼻聲多見於鼻內組織的萎縮。破壞穿孔。口蓋的穿孔。軟口蓋的缺損。浸潤等時。這是因爲在發聲的時候，它的呼氣。大半竄人鼻腔內的綠故。</p>
<p>（一零七）由鼻病而來的神經障礙及反射神經症狀</p>
<p>由鼻病而來的一般神經障碍中。最多的。當推頭痛一症。頭痛的性狀。可分爲二。卽限局性及廣汛性。限局性者。則限於一局部。譬如鼻根部。前頭部。顳顧部。顱頂部。及後頭部等處。廣汛性者。則放散波及全頭部。頭痛的强度。亦有種種。在輕度的時侯。祗有壓重感覺。在强度的時候。則爲劇烈穿刺樣的疼痛。此時患者大都苦痛不堪。鼻病中。最多而最易頭痛的。當爲鼻閉塞及副鼻腔蓄膿症。此外所謂神經障碍者。則有不眠。精神的或肉體的早期疲勞感覺。全身倦怠。無力。記憶力减退。及鼻性注意不能症等等。就中所謂鼻性注意不能症者。多見於高度鼻閉塞的患者（允以腺樣增殖症爲多）。往往不能集中它的注意力。同時常伴記憶力减退。及眩暈等症狀。</p>
<p>至於反射性神經症狀。則概以喘息。夜尿症。神經性耳鳴。咳嗽。及生殖器隙碍等等爲主徵。</p>
<p>最近從報紙上，從消息中，我們看到聽到一羣珍貴生命死於惡性瘧疾，這種悲慘的消息是源源飄來，蔓延的快，流行的廣，這是多麼凄慘而恐怖的事情。</p>
<p>諸位，誰個人願意把自己的生命送進死亡錢上去呢？可你染上了疾病，沒有好好的治療，病勢會嚴重起來，甚至於死亡，這是必然的結果。尤其是一種傳染病？就非常厲害，差不多整個江蘇各縣都流行着這種傳染病。眞駭怕！</p>
<p>現在我們問惡性瘧疾爲什麼會怎樣流行的呢？一方面固然是氣侯的關係？但是最大的問題還是沒有預防，大家知道預防工作是比較治療工作容易而收效大，曾經有人這樣講過：現在的醫學已經由治療醫學而進步到預防醫學，可是爲什麼還會把惡性瘧疾滋長得這樣厲害呢這雖然是中國預防醫學和預防止作還在萌芽時代，然而，民衆衛生知識低落和預防機關的注意形式，也是一個絕大的原因。</p>
<p>從這裏我們得到一個很大的敎訓，就是衛生機關不僅僅是做一點治療工作和形式宣傳，應當切實的注意民衆疾病的預防，像這種惡性瘧疾，假如能够在剛發生或沒有發生之前，注意到怎樣的預防？由衛生機關宣傳給大衆，或强迫預防，那我相信至少死亡率絕不會有這樣高！</p>
<p>旣然現在過去已經成了過去，那麼就是今後衛生機關應該怎樣來推進預防醫學？敎導民衆如何的注意到疾病的預防？現在我們就隨便拿一個例子來說一說：就如省會衛生事務所，他所負的使命當然是注意公共衛生和疾病的預防，然而，實質呢？究竟收到多少效力？這不過省會的民衆享受到它的好處罷了！然而，鄉村呢？就是一個問號了。</p>
<p>可是實質的講，從今年惡性瘧疾死亡數，鄉村與城市的比較，鄉村的死亡數要好幾倍的高於城市，所以從這一點，應當刻不容緩的注意「鄕村衛生」才行！這不是一個空口號，的確關係民族健康的問題，非常大！在鄕村傳染病一發生，就無法阻止，這是多麼凄慘的事！這里我們可以提供出一點意見：就是希望政府帮助着各縣組織「鄉村醫藥衛生巡迴隊」，負起敎導民衆知道疾病的預防，同時更訓練民衆知道普通衛生常識，最好能够在每一個區公所設立一所義務性質的衛生機關，來負責一區間的衛生事業，還有最好就是時常化裝演講，借民衆集會，授以深刻的衛生常識。</p>
<p>再一點，就是民衆爲什麼會不知道注意疾病和衛牛的？固然是民衆的迷信的觀念太深！同時對於一種科學的醫學，沒有具體的認識，最大一點還是經濟的鎖枷困縛住他們，祗能用迷信的心理來麻醉病人，或且請庸醫來暫時安慰病者，這是非常可怕的事情！現在我們要想設法消滅和掃除有害的觀念和思想，最要緊的一點，就是應當使民衆敎育起來不可！</p>
<p>我們知道過去衛生機關失敗的原因，就是專門注意一點形式，不知道怎樣充實內容？換一句話說：也就是今後應該努力的一個途徑！大家知道衛生機關的成績是最難十分的表現出來！我們是十分的承認，可是假如衛生事業的工作努力，我們可以說傳染病的流行和死亡率的减少，至少可以减少和降低。</p>
<p>現在我們把以上的話歸納起來講，要使民衆注意疾病的預防，第一要件，就是充實他們的衛生知識。第二急不容緩的注意起「鄉村衛生」。第三在鄕村多設衛生機關，第四校正民衆對於科學醫學的錯誤觀念。第五就是希望衛牛機關從允實內容做起。最後，希望全體的知識份子，盡各人的力量，帮同宣傳衛生，那就易辦了！</p>

<p>— （太玄）</p>
<p>「一年樹殺，十年樹木，百年樹人。」所以治國者，在臨深淵，覆薄冰一樣的艱難困苦途徑中掙扎出一條生之大道。這一條血汗築成的大道，是要拼着千百萬的頭顱，去作奠基典禮，那末纔有落成希望的把握。</p>
<p>從着樹殺，樹木，樹人相差年限的此數上推想去，欲措國家於磐石之安，那至少限度，當然要顧到百年大計，我們從鴉片之戰起，到現在差不多有近百年歷史了，這百年中所受到的侵略和恥辱，真是不堪設想，若干萬方里的國王，數千萬的同胞，都在黑暗中伸着手向我們求援；這是我們應負的重大責任，這也是我們天天牢記在心頭時刻不容遺忘的責任。</p>
<p>在我們要完成樹立國家百年大計，第一要求自已自立，誰要侵犯我自存自立或阻撓我自存自立的，那末惟有與之拼命，因為能拼命，纔可絕處逢生。現在巳到了上述最後的關頭，惟待侵略者之是否能懸崖勒馬？我們為着確保國家自存自立的大計，四萬萬五千萬的同胞，早巳站上同一的戰綫上去了。</p>
<h3 id="c223">友誼 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 朱英</p>
<p>友誼究竟是怎麼　模樣？究竟是該怎樣持的？我不　。</p>
<p>我在跨出校門時，共見上五位以上的同學，不只每月的通着三次信，而且還是有着相當的友義，日間　若干，更蒙瞧得起我，有婚喪喜慶，總是不忘着給我一份紅帖兒，或白帖兒。而我也總是任可能範圍之內，親往慶弔的。接着，我自已結婚了，發了紅帖兒出去，其間便有三位，沒有了回音。過了一年，先嚴棄養，我散了白帖出去，便又有四位。沒向我弔唁，而絕了音問。又過了一年，我失業了，於是寫信去央求友誼尚存的同學們，代為留意介紹。不意這一次信，出去之後，僅得了四們的回信，允為留意着，其餘的，索性都一些兒沒有消息，迄今，大家都不知行蹤何在了。那所僅存的四位之中的某一位，因我曾向他移挪了一次欵項，而怕見我的面，也所和我通信了。雖然那二次的借欵，我都如期的本利歸趙，毫無拖欠，但他却因此而不高興與我往來，那也是無法之事。還有一位，他曾向我告貨十元，後又向我告貸五元，從此以後，他在街上見了我，使老遠的躲開了。到了年終，賀年片也不來了。我寄去的賀年片，也不給郵局退回來，原來他已移居到不知那裏去了。第三位，是曾求我給代借很可觀的一個大借欵，我因無此能力，愛莫能助，而復信回絕了。結果，却接獲了他的滿紙牢騷怨憤的絕交信。現所僅存着的，尚還保持着友誼的同學，是只有一位了，但是不知道這位，將來是否也有棄我而去的一日。</p>
<p>四年之前，我曾交往過一位女朋友。這位女朋友的性情，是溫和的，言談是不俗的，學識是在水平綫上的。因為和我的習性，尚還相近，所以我們倆，便發生了很密切的友誼關係。我是一個有婦之夫，而且我　生活的鞭策，絕對的不具着　些兒野心，所以我對於那位女朋友的態度，是絕對不越出友誼範圍的。雖然我們一個月，得通二三次信，通四五次電話，而目有幾還同往觀劇，同往郊外遊玩，可是絕對一些兒都不涉及兒女之私的。這麼着相交了三年，伊向我微露願結為終身伴侶之意，我忙義正辭嚴的拒絕。接着，伊是找得了對手，舉行婚禮了。在伊結婚時，我還很誠敬的前往道賀。不意伊結婚之後，竟把原有的友誼棄掉了。我二次去訪晤，都說不在家。某一次，伊同丈夫，在街上散步，一眼瞧見了我，便把頭低下了，裝作沒見。最近，我寫了一封問候信去，隔了一星期，接得了伊的回信，說的為了避嫌疑起見，求我以後勿再寫信去。我於是乎知道我們原來所有的，還並不是友誼咧。</p>
<h3 id="c224">全國漫畫展評 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>大家期待了好久的「全國漫書展」，總算於本月四日的那天開幕在大新了。這次的全漫展，據負責人說：是為了籌備時間匆促，所以名義上雖寫的是「全國」，而實際上「全國的作家」却沒有能夠一網打盡。</p>
<p>但，在量的方面說：已是很可觀的了，論到質的方面，似乎還有些不足罷？</p>
<p>漫書，在中國的歷史很短的，但，它能在很短的時間內，奮　到這個地步，獲得這末優良的果實，已是一件不輕易的事了。本來我們不應該再有什麼苛求的。不過，漫書的使命，是像敢死隊那樣的要站在時代的最前綫，衝！殺！猶且目下的世界情勢，目下的中國社會，是再不能容納什麼幽閒，沉醉，香艷，肉感以至於無意義的滑稽的漫書了。而是須要擊住了中心思想，含着深刻的意义，藉诸表现世界思想之动态，暴露现社会之黑暗，负有不能不負的职责，握有左右社会思想，改善社會风俗，建設青年意志之威權的幽默的諷刺的漫書。</p>
<p>如該展中署名陳依範的几张單色漫書，可以看出作者的技巧與思想都是相當的有過修養的。在它的書面上，並沒有鮮艷的彩色，但，它却能吸引觀衆。使人看了想再看，真有所謂百看不厭的效力。固然有人說：漫書是無須着重技巧的，衹要有思想。不錯，假若能如陳君那樣，技巧與思想並重，豈不更加美滿嗎？再如光宇，正宇，淺予；諸君的幾張漫書肖像，肖像當然讀不到什麼意思，然，他們却都具有純熟的美妙的技巧，所以也給予觀衆很深的印象。再有署名樺櫓的幾張「藝術的」漫書，他的色彩，綫條，構圖都是極新鮮的，「純藝趣味的」，「天才的」。但，衹可惜「思想」不大健全。</p>
<p>其他的佳作甚多，不克一一介紹，總之，卽如上述的那樣，他們共同的缺點，是過於注重了趣味。換句話說：就是前進的東西太少，而無聊的貨色却過多。關於這，我們很有興致約期待着，期待着他們能在第二次全漫展時給我們以滿美的答覆。</p>
<h3 id="c225">金魚漫話 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>入秋以來，奇旱不雨，池沼之屬，日久涸竭，金魚唯一食料之水虱，因以絕跡，比來滬上藝魚之家，乃皆改飼粥粒，他若恃魚為生之園家，平日四出撈取，亦往往難得十一，故本年「發頭」，至長難逾二寸，設一園而有一二百缸者，魚體　脊，都形委頓，聞間有數園，因井水乾枯，擔水無從，小魚悉任萎疲，魚奴仰屋與嗟，從喚奈何矣。</p>
<p>邇以嗣母病　喘促歸，閑嘗詢之蘇地　藝魚同志，據告：此間月餘未予活食，粥糜將養，何能滋長，均謂本年魚市，將成歉收，天旱之影響水產，亦云大矣。</p>
<p>愚自今春為　冠生園設計定製「魚杯」問世，數百打巳不脛而走，從知海上愛魚者日多，曾就窰家定製一種「青沙魚缸」，式仿天津缸之小號而口徑加敝，受陽光足，取名曰「罎」，初製二十只，已被友好陸續讓去，二次又定數十，若陳人鶴，周劍雲，奚玉書諸先生公館，均置數事。用「罎」飼　魚，有數特點，如體肥身短，頭角崢嶸，尾大四張有勁，水色易綠，食量亦宏，今春，就「罎」中藝　魚，先擇體態端正者，每罎置二十尾，日予充分活食，每晚打腳添水，如此十日，魚已長大一　，（原先半寸。此時巳到一寸）爾撈去十尾分養，仍如前法飼之，不半月，又長倍覆，若更欲共大，可移　水泥池，食給足，水長沖，則一夏過後，本年　魚巳長四寸，　云池中魚體必長，但先經「罎」中數十天之規欄，包可無了學形之虞矣。包天笑丈滬寓亦飼名種珠魚　數缸，就中有「水泡眼」兼反頭一種，數雖僅二三對，卽為經過「罎」中飼養者，外間所罕觀也。</p>
<p>晤蘇州公園主任范雲書先生，告本魚魚菊屢覧會，已約定蘇農校合作，定期十一月十日左右在公園舉行，真正徵求吳中公私家　名種魚菊出品，屆時盛況，可以預卜，容俟觀覧再誌。</p>
<h3 id="c226">薪水階級 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 曼子</p>
<p>一般的薪水階級，都感到兩種苫悶，一是退老以後的生活供給，無從取得；二是不幸而中途殘廢，沒有保障。顯然有許多種關工廠學校商號，有團體保險，有養老金，有撫卹，到底是少數之少數。而多數之多數，能夠按月發給薪水，並無蒂見延綏，經皆大歡喜了。</p>
<p>「夜會」就是描寫一個忠於工廠的化學師，為了藥品的爆炸，恐怕使工廠全部毀滅，他冒了險去搶護，以致自已的兩眼受了傷，廠方因了他已經殘癈，給了一點醫藥費。和一筆少量的　欵。解除了他的職務。一個全靠薪水給養的快樂家庭，頓時陷入悲慘的境界，勞觀者說：這個年頭，靠薪水度日的，真是一　沒有保障麼？　想無論　人聽到了這話，　心底裏湧起一陣酸來的。</p>
<p>的另一面，描寫一個沒有受過高等教育的女子為子要安定家庭生活，不惜犧牲色相，到夜花園裏去萬事通招待，少得僅能糊口的薪水，自然不能滿足伊的需求，於是不幸的遭逢，使已不得不殺人而殺。女招待之類，不是現社會一種很普遍而正在發展的薪水階級麼？當伊們裝着笑臉向顧客應對時，顧客只在色相上着眼，誰能相到伊們的背後，有着一羣嗷嗷待哺的家人？誰能看到伊們的心底，有着無量的隱痛呢？</p>
<p>所以「夜會」無異為薪水階級吶喊，無異為薪水隊級要求一個解答，在意義上是非常嚴重的，我希望觀衆不要為富麗堂皇的場面而炫惑，不要為燈紅酒綠而陶醉，不要為輕蘋倩笑而迷樂，因為這一部影片，是我千萬薪水階級的共鳴。</p>

<p>第八回　杯水盟心青燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>自已的功課，所最沒有把握的，就是幾何一門。隨便的在書上翻出一個問題來，都很恍惚。決趁着這涼天，把定理多多的記下一些。於是把心事穩定了，就拿了一本幾何學看。往日按下心看來，總可以把收灌注一些到腦子裏去。可是今天越看書，却是越迷糊。於是把書且放天一邊，隨手在書架上，拿了一本雜誌來看。翻過來，還是幾首充滿了情感的小詩，看到之後，隨便吟詠着也覺得有味。吟詠之後，再加以衛仔細的咀嚼，更覺心裏滋味充滿。不知不覺把雜誌看過一小時以後，轉又想起，正是溫習功課的時候，怎好把時間隨便消磨了。於是把雜誌挪到一邊，重新把功課拿來看。他就是這樣的舉動，翻來覆去，不能自主。很快的，又是晚飯以後，屋子裏亮上燈了。正在燈下出神，今天要怎麼來消磨這淒涼的晚上呢？却　到樓下有了友梅的聲音。他道：你巳經見過了江太太，送着我到了這裏回去，也就交的了差了，你還跟着作什麼呢？這就聽着一個婦人答道：我也要上樓去，給江小姐請請安罷。夢蘭迎到房門外樓蘭杆邊，向樓下望着，笑道：你真是個信人，說來就來。說話時，在他身後發現了一名女僕。因笑道：梅，你還要人把你磅上來嗎？那女僕搶上前一步，昂了頭向樓上道：江小姐，我們太太說，我們小姐到這裏打攪你，請你不要太客氣了。夢蘭笑他：好罷，把人交給我，你可以回去了。那女僕笑着，倒真是走了。友梅上得樓來，先握了道的手低聲笑道：你看，家家的子女，父母都是這樣擔心管着的呵！夢蘭點點頭。於是兩人同坐在桌子邊，隔了一盞白瓷罩子煤油燈，互相望着。小菊兒送了壹菊花茶來，又擺着四碟乾點心在桌上。友梅笑道：這樣子，你也是料定了我會來，預備了這些東西待客的。夢蘭笑道：國為你在我面前的信用很好，所以我知道你會來，還用不着我怎樣的預料。小菊，你下樓去。小菊靠門站定，是向他二人呆呆望着的，這就笑道：小姐不呌我，我不上來，好嗎？（九六）</p>

<h3 id="c229">日本運動下屆世運地點的內幕 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 一髮</p>
<p>第十二屆世界支運動會已決定舉行於日本東京，東京的市民，都在那裏夢想着大會時繁榮的景象了。世界運動會在東方舉行，這是第一次，其所以決議於東方的，並非日本的運動成績已如何優良，乃是歐美的視綫，因了國際關係而注視到東方來之故。一方面日本對決定世運地點的活動，亦十分努力。新建設急速建樹著的我國，將來世界運動會，或許有決定在南京紫金山下的一天罷，勿使日本專美於前。</p>
<p>日本活動世運地點，遠在七年之前。國際陸上運動聯盟會長哀特斯脫洛氏到日本旅行，他是瑞典人。在日本學生陸上運動會聯合會的歡迎席上，有一個學生忽然發言詢問「世界運動會是否在東京舉行。」「無所謂不可能的，只要向委員會提出請求，再加着手續上的幹旋。」會長說，適逢開國二千六百年紀念。於是這（世運東京招致案）在市議會中通過了。派了議員到歐洲去活動之外，又請各國大使協助。</p>
<p>洛桑大會時，日本派了識員五人，到那裏去考察，並和世運委員交際，正式提出了請求書。並印了許多的照片宣傳品，送給各國委員。去年世運委員會在　威亞斯洛開會，其時東京亦決定為候補都市之一，請求都市，達十處以上，以東京及羅馬為最有望，後來意大利國為財政困難自願退辭，却添了一人芬蘭的生力軍。芬蘭的宣傳品上，會每一張統計國書，以人口所得世运分数作比例的。芬兰最高是三.七，日本居末位，只有　而已。说是「日本的運動界尚未開化，東京當然無舉行大會的資格，」日本人見了狼狽異常。</p>
<p>到了今年，世運會長伯氏，被日本人拉到了日本來旅行，由德州公開組織世運凖備會，竭力籠絡。投票十日前，東京和倫敦，希望相等。其所以能成功，全得伯氏之助。伯氏任日本時，已看到日本預備下屆運動場的設計圖，認為日本籌備積極。那知道這是特製供給伯氏觀賞用的。現在世運已決定在日本，還無一定的建設計劃，報紙宣傳，都是一張白紙而已。</p>
<p>日本運動世運地點的費用，自民國二十一年起到現在，已費了四十八萬元。這次聘請伯氏來日，招待費四萬五千元。在伯林的宣傳費，電信費，交際費等，約六萬元。如此看來爭一個世運的地點，竟有如此竟外的困難呢。</p>

<h3 id="c230">偽軍向綏北進攻 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>據昨日報載，僞軍張海鵬部，由承德向西侵犯，包悅卿部三千人，亦由熱西調，聞各部以百靈廟爲會集中心，再分向綏東綏北前進，又息，察北偽騎兵，已開始向綏北進襲，傳作義在歸化召開軍事會議，綏北防務，佈置妥善，刻在對峙中云云，他們的西進政策，欲犯綏東綏北已久，所以連日綏遠緊急的消息，正如雪片飛來，絡繹不絕，不過到了今日，形勢更加緊張，所謂兩軍在對峙中者，正如舊小說所云，兩軍相對，旗門開處，一員大將出來的時候，這原是何等緊急的局面。</p>
<p>此次戰事，勝負誰屬，原是且看下回分解的事，但是我們常知察綏的重要性，察哈爾綏遠，原是天產豐富之區，又爲北方諸省的屛蔽，因爲現在的所謂萬里長城，已不能作爲金湯的險要，萬一察綏一去，所謂萬里長城者，已與敵共，現在察哈爾的情形如何？我有些不明白，現在惟見綏遠吃緊的消息便了，萬一綏遠亦不能保，則長城以內的諸省均危，决不能以綏遠遠在長城以外，而可膜視。</p>
<p>據大美晚報訊，近日來中日間之側面預備談判，其重要性不亞於正面外交折衝，高宗武與須磨，定明日再作側面會談，對中日雙方不能接近之點，謀取折衷辦法，本來天下事，多可以相商，但假定遇到甲乙兩人商酌一事，甲謂請將足下的心，剖開來給我，或請將某一部份支體，解剖給我，乙方無論若何遷就，總也不會允許他吧？平津是我們的心腹，察綏是我們的股肱，怎樣可以有一尺一寸的土地讓給人家，一絲一毫的主權讓給人家，這是任何用威嚇軟騙的方法，所不能答應的。</p>
<p>所以我敢相信中日談判，談到經過任何時期，恐難得圓滿的結果，這我並不是希望雙方談判的決裂，因照事實上觀察，實無雙方妥協之可能，幷且一方正在談判，而偽軍日絡縹西開，已向綏北進攻的消息迭至，此種行動，完全不欲平和解决的表示，我們相信綏遠當局，必定有令入滿意的應付，而中央當局，亦必有以善其後，而不以尋常外禍目之也，故欲看中日談判之能解决與吾，當先看綏遠的僞軍行動能停止與否。</p>

<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>差不多每天，在某一個固定的時間，我們便能够看見他，一個背着一隻大皮箱，手中拿着十來根新烟筒的賣烟人，默默的跨進店來，把裝烟絲的皮箱望玻璃櫃檯上一放，伸手去抹面上的汗濕；然後才低聲的問道：「老板，今天烟絲要不？」</p>
<p>我們馬上便要去檢察烟絲匣，於是這樣答覆：「來半斤—便是：一不用，還有呢。」</p>
<p>而他又要默默的背起皮箱，跨出店去，挨過第二家，走了。</p>
<p>這傢伙是永春人，我跟他相識已經快有年多了。他很柔靜，不說笑，也不說多餘的話，在他那高亢的身上，我們除了那一套天靑麻布短衣褲，頭上一頂竹尖笠，竹笠除下便是像牛糞一樣的盤起的黑辮子，足上裸赤，有一雙多耳朶的草鞋外，便沒見他用第二種方法打扮過。就是在狂熱的聖誕節，過年，他也是這樣，不同的，只是坐在家里抽旱烟吧！</p>
<p>「他是一個怪物！」和他有了來往的商人，差不多都是這樣想，無形中他漸漸的被引起了注意，而作爲奧秘的象徵看待。</p>
<p>有一天，我們給一個奇異的消息弄得不安起來了，那消息是從一個廣東小販傳來的。他報吿了大家說這永春人，在岷里拉已有一個漂亮的唐山老婆了，是去年才由他一個堂弟帶去的，而且在因樹列他還開有一所烟絲店，由這個女人管理的。說罷，他又霎着那雙小眼賠，揮動着手描劃着。這不但使我們開始對這個永春人大大的注意着，而且感到了十分興趣：於是，每當他到我們底店裏來兜售烟絲時，我們往往便含笑的問道：</p>
<p>「永春人，聽說在這兒，你還有一個唐山老婆？」</p>
<p>他紅着面，默默的向大家盯着眼，好像是說：你們爲什麼要管這些閑事？</p>
<p>「很漂亮吧，人家都這樣說。」</p>
<p>他便一句也不答，好像受了侮辱似的，背起皮箱，默默的又跨出店去。但是，當他第二天來時，他便又會像沒經過這麼一回事似的：「老板，今天烟絲要不？」</p>
<p>一天，午後，我被店裏派出去收賬，在埋埋橋邊我碰見他。他是賣完了貨，正想回家的。我遠遠的向他抬手招呼着，而且緊接上幾步追上他。「賣完了？」我低聲的問。「回家去！」他連着一眼也不看地說着，面孔仍低在地下。</p>
<p>「你家在什么地方　」</p>
<p>「因樹列，那兒有我開的店舖。」我暗暗地想着：「爲什麼不跟他去看看？」於是便掉轉口氣問：「我可以和你一起走？」</p>
<p>他第一次抬起頭來，向我看着，好像還有點不安心似的。看我已沒有什麼惡意，或嘲弄他的神氣了，便默默的把頭點着，悄悄說過：「我很歡喜！」</p>
<p>我們都沒說什麼話，靜靜的繞過市民公園，折轉了波勒廢塲，而沿一條灰暗的小街道走。</p>
<p>這街道，差不多就建築在市區外，荒凉而且寂寞的。在街道的兩邊擠着幾十間舊鋅房子，有些是作爲居住，有些是作爲小商舖用的，在岷里拉，這兒是被劃定作爲貧窮階級的住民區，種類和人口，是同樣的佔多數而且復雜，有西班牙人，有日本人，有中國人和在地土人。</p>
<p>在一條跨過混濁的泥水河的木橋邊，有一問矮小的鋅房子，房子頂有一面橫招牌伸過了半街，上面用歪斜的中國字寫着「正興烟絲鋪」五個大字，底下是一行英文，也是用同樣笨拙的文體寫成的，我們在橋的這邊斜坡下，他便遠遠的把那塊牌子指着，吿訴我道：</p>
<p>「看見沒有？那兒就是我開的烟絲舖。」</p>
<p>我們慢慢的朝橋下的斜坡上走去，到可以看見橋底另一邊街道了。忽然我被一陣紛擾的景象吸住了，在那兒，正有一羣小孩子站在烟絲店外，揚着兩隻小小的臂膊，而且把手中握着的沙土丟進店去。從店裏就發出了一陣呌罵聲。一個年靑婦人，顛上結着一個高頭髻，上下身穿了套黑衣褂，手中拿了一把旱烟筒，太踏步的飛跑出來，那些小孩子嚇的一哄散開，拍手而且笑着呌喊：</p>
<p>「看哇，小脚的支那女人·……」</p>
<p>這使我想起，而且開始注意起來了是的，她是小脚的，穿一雙綉花鞋，可是，她却像一個平常人一樣的行動自若，揮動她手中的武器，笑着趕打那些小鬼。</p>
<p>當我們進了店，永春人放下了背上的皮箱時，那些小鬼已全躱進一個籬笆裏去了，她也像沒過這麼一回事似的回轉來，一點也沒有女兒氣的笑着道：</p>
<p>「這些小鬼，天天喊：看中國女人的小脚！當眞跑出去給他們看時，却又一個個的嚇跑了。……」</p>
<p>她底豪放的態度，深深地把我驚住了。</p>

<p>— 柏子</p>
<p>今天又到鄕村里來了。</p>
<p>我願意有幾個美麗的月夜，好讓我和登弟到田壩上去聽蛙聲，聽狗皮蛇兒聲，聽田壩上的冲激的水聲。好讓我和登弟到田壩上去，去看月，月色裏面的村莊，村莊前面的那的塊龐大的田疇，看小風把滿田滿田的水秧吹縐了。我一壁走，一壁在做這些夢。妻慢慢地落後了，同奶媽：她像是累了似的，老是那麼蹣跚着。我們走過了坪，我們遶過了灣，我們經過了一重村落又一重村落。</p>
<p>路在我的記憶中畫着爛熟的曲綫，那起伏着的，遠遠的山，也好像曾經用我的手畫過的一樣。</p>
<p>細風在我們的頭髮上，在我們的衣襟上，和在那邊兒的水波上，細細的風，陣陣地。於是，我的童年的回憶，慢慢的來了：我步入了童年時代——</p>
<p>一切均是原樣，雖然是一匹很小很小的蘆葦。我們赤着肩背，常常打這條路上走過，衣服拴在頭頂，算是遮遮太陽。</p>
<p>「孩子，不怕淹死嗎？」</p>
<p>一天，米龍老伯遇見了我們，那個傴僂而且怪逗我們惡心的老丈，他明知道我們是去介魚潭洗澡玩的。</p>
<p>「不會的啊！」</p>
<p>我和我的伙子們同聲回答他；但那回，登弟是確然受了點危險，那時節，登弟還沒有和我們一塊兒玩水的資格呢！</p>
<p>一洗完了操，便又開始在這條路上摘一蘆葦，把那細長的蘆莖，一根一根的從一葉中拨出，拿回去當箭頭明天作戰用。一這條路，是我們往日的樂園呀！想想，一昨天的事情似的，歷歷可數。</p>
<p>可是，現在又是私收以後的九月，登弟的婚期，聽說便是這個十月的末梢，一眨眼，這孩子又快作大人呢！</p>
<p>我有些茫然了。</p>
<p>我凝視着那邊，那一道被風吹縐了水的溪—淺淺的溪流。我放慢了脚步。</p>
<p>拐過一座木橋，便瞧見油房在楓樹下躱着，從油房到萬家瑙，只一斗烟草那麼遠，還記得小時節，常常同着一樣大的小伙子們到這兒樹根邊下棋，一下子不對勁，便搭塲罵嘴，罵一陣野話，散伙了。如今，那些喜歡罵嘴的哥兒那里去了？大致都長大成人了吧？不至於再爲一着「九子」來一决兒嘴舌了吧？就問妻：</p>
<p>「還記得蠻牛嗎？」</p>
<p>「他是我們的佃戶。」</p>
<p>「還記得黑狗嗎？」</p>
<p>「他是我們的佃戶。」</p>
<p>「望生呢？」</p>
<p>「也是。」</p>
<p>佃戶？我想。我幾乎不相信妻的，怎麼只七八個年頭，事情竟有如此的兩樣，我有些猜疑。</p>
<p>想起了住日，便把洗操的故事，同妻說，把摘蘆葦當箭頭用的故事，同妻說，把下棋老要吵嘴的故事，也同妻說。同妻說？我擔心着妻不會了解。</p>
<p>妻跟在後面，聽得出帶着點喘息。</p>
<p>我們在路上——在油房跟前了，這脚下是一道小溪，溪邊有女人洗衣服，發現了我們，她們擲着笑，遠遠地。</p>
<p>那是外祖母的家，浮現於竹林上的，那個寂寞的屋項。</p>
<p>我掉過頭來，對妻說：　「快到外婆家啦！」</p>
<p>我頭一决學着兒子說：妻只是一笑，害羞地。</p>
<h3 id="c233">牧羊女 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 浩林</p>
<p>一提起牧羊女黎莎，人們都禁不住要嘆息幾聲。</p>
<p>這眞是一個命運的悲劇。　　還是兩年前的事，那時候，黎莎却是個快樂的人兒，並且，她是衆女中最美麗的，有着壯健的身體和活潑的靑春。最足使她時常向人驕傲的，就是她的那位吉爾台萊（註一），山中的女郞們誰不羨慕她有這麼好幸福呢？</p>
<p>吉爾台萊是黎莎的戀人，他並不呌做這個名字，那是她的女伴們給封贈的，他的眞名是薩布齊。</p>
<p>某决祭神節裏的賽會，他倆都被選入唱歌的隊列中，賽神時，這兩個人兒的嘹亮的迴絕凡饗的歌音是給與會的人們傾倒了，恐怕連亞伊（註二）也聽了人迷吧；因此歌者男組中的薩本齊，女組中的黎莎，登時普遍地讓人們知道了。他倆也就在這時認識的。</p>
<p>薩布齊是住在江對面山上，但這却並沒有怎麼妨礙，每天，他泛着一隻獨木小舟，渡過這邊來。黎莎呢，站在高崖上，一望到薩布齊的小舟划到岸邊，她便興高彩烈地跑下去迎接着，自己的羊兒也不照管了，只顧和他在一塊兒。</p>
<p>林菁的深處，常常有這一對人兒的縱跡，人們從他倆身前走過，總會聽到兩入在天眞地笑語，快樂得像樹頭的小鳥，在她們的日子裏，似乎全然不知道憂愁是怎麼。有時他們高興起來，放開喉嚨唱歌，歌聲婉轉，連林中叢木也都寂靜地在聽着。記得是一個深夜，皎月在半空裏高高朗照着、人們聚在林邊談着閒話，夜聲很淸幽，大家都領味着。猛然林中傳來一段歌聲：</p>
<p>人兒，你是衆女之王，</p>
<p>你的明媚善睞的雙眸，</p>
<p>像六月夜晚天上的星星，</p>
<p>璀璨地發着一光，</p>
<p>映照我在林中微步，</p>
<p>你美麗的小鹿呵，</p>
<p>讓我獵獲了你罷，</p>
<p>接着是個女郞唱下去：</p>
<p>英勇的獵者，</p>
<p>你來靠近我的身旁，</p>
<p>永遠不要離開，</p>
<p>我飲你以潔白的心之乳：</p>
<p>登上高山，</p>
<p>萬木森蔽，我們將棲息其中。</p>
<p>誰也要被這歌聲溶化了，幾使疑感是諦卡思和他的洛琳黛陀出來夜遊（註三），但誰都曉得，那是薩布齊和黎莎在和唱呀。</p>
<p>光陰向前駛，他倆仍狂熱地相愛着。</p>
<p>有一天，薩布齊的了在傍晚時過江來，黎莎老早就立在崖上望着。這天的天氣很壞，陰雲沉沉，在風不停地吹，江中的濤浪高捲如山，又落地了暴雨。站在崖頭的黎莎，衣服都濕透了，却寸步不移，她的羊羣被急雨驅迫着，一齊驚竄入林跑散了。她似望到風雨迷濛的江面，薩布齊的小舟正破浪前衝，天色漸漸黑下了，他還沒有過來，黎莎仍痴痴守望着，後來還是她哥哥走來把她拉回去。整夜，黎莎在枕上翻覆睡不穩，隱的聽見薩布齊的呼喊聲在急風猛雨中凄然嚮着。</p>
<p>夜過去了，太陽依舊愉快地露着臉，江邊漂流着一隻破碎的小舟，人們認得，那是薩布齊的，舟中還擱着他那桿獵槍呢。</p>
<p>黎莎從此瘋了，每天她都站在從前等候薩布齊過來的那崖上哭着，要是起風下雨的日子，那哀泣眞悲慘得很，誰聽了都要落淚的。</p>
<p>（註一）俄倫春古代神話中的男愛神，此處借用爲愛人。</p>
<p>（註二）薩滿敎善神名亞伊。</p>
<p>（註三）是兩個善歌的男神和女神，傳說他們常在深夜中出來唱歌。</p>

<p>— 劉公島</p>
<p>每次走過那所新造的洋式住宅，我便懷戀着那被拆毀了的木板小橋。</p>
<p>那住宅的原址，是一條小溪。因為河身太高的緣故，外江潮漲時，水流才緩緩地從石塊的隙縫里流進來。我就站在木板小橋上，看它像遊龍似的轉灣抹角一直拐過橋脚向一家住宅的木椿下通到我所看不見的地方去。下潮時候，它又從木椿下瀉回來，沿着原來路向外江流去。不過它變得那樣瑞爭，憤怒，它沖激着阻碍它去路的石塊，一隊衝鋒的騎兵似的發出鏗鏘的吼聲。</p>
<p>我每天站立在橋頭，彷彿會晤一個情人那樣默默地相對着，我做着一個夢，夢中有一個年輕的姑娘：她是死在這溪流中的。</p>
<p>那年輕的姑娘有着對逗人的黑眼珠，她也是每天在橋頭出現，她到河邊洗浣衣服。我看到她的時候，她的烏黑的辮子巳經紥着白色的絨線了。是的，一個孤獨的孩子她是太需要一個懂得風情的男子去愛戀她的，但是她所鍾情的男子生着一顆懦弱的心，他不敢逼視她的那對逗人的黑眼珠，她感到失望了。在一個春風輕悄的晚上，她像下潮時的溪流那樣，在黑夜里喘急地投奔到那個男子的懷中去。</p>
<p>那個男子替她生了一個女孩，一個見不得人的女孩，於是她被溪流帶走了，為了那個男子沒有方法處置她…</p>
<p>我還是每天站在木板小橋上…</p>
<p>水流每天流來流去，衝壞了那家住宅的木椿，他們就把小河收買了，拆毀了橋樑，填平了河身，一所新的洋式住宅毘連着舊房子造了起來。</p>
<p>…於是我失去了每天留戀的地方！</p>
<p>洋房里的女主人是懂得音樂的，她每天奏着琴，哀怨如泣，大槪她沒有知道住宅底下埋葬着一個懂得風情的年輕底姑娘吧？</p>
<p>每次走過她門前的時候，我便懷戀着被拆毀了的木板小橋。</p>
<p>我想追尋我的夢…</p>

<p>名滿天下的賽金花，誰個不知，那個不曉，是出使俄德荷奧四國欽差大臣洪文卿的夫人。當洪文卿出使的時候，她跟着他周游列國，在德國她光榮的被飛麗皇后三天不隔二天的召進宫去談話，當然，更不用説，在國際間宴會的場合，她是風頭最健，常常爲青年將校所包圍。</p>
<p>後來，洪欽差回國，不幾年就死了。賽金花的命運，才一天天顯着灰黯的前途。</p>
<p>賽金花的未亡人做了不滿兩個月，洪太太請了兩個大官員跟她説，問她願不願守寡　賽金花是個挺爽直的人，老老實實求洪太太放她走。原因是她天生就一副愛熱閙的脾氣，洪文卿死了，没人管束她，她自個兒又守不了，硬守住，怕閙出不好聽的話來，才眞的對不住洪文轉，她不會裝幌子騙人騙自已，不如直捷了當的走了，好歹活不干洪家的事，況且那時她只二下歲，死不惶　為什麼　守，又那兒能守吶！</p>
<p>當時講定了三個條件：第一，在短時期內不准上京師，那兒熟人太多；第二，今後不准用富彩雲和夢黛這兩名字標榜；第三，除出遺囑上的五萬塊錢，和首飾衣服外，不准向洪家需索。在這三個條件之下，她離開洪家。</p>
<p>可是洪家文卿遺囑上的五萬塊錢，她分文無着，都被洪家的一位侄少爺呑沒丁，以後她生活漸漸窘迫起來。</p>
<p>六年後在江南在平津，人們都閧傳着賽金花這個漂亮的女人。這是因為覆行條約，她把原來的名字，改稱了賽金花的。</p>
<p>有一次，戶部尚書兼佐北洋軍務立山的老太太做壽，賽金花從天津趕去湊熱鬧，在那狂歡的立府里，賽金花和慮玉芳侍郎拜了把子，稱兄道弟。並且把班子從天津收拾了到北京，這時正是義和拳在天津北京鬧得頂兇的時候。（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) Fellow townsmen from Suiyuan in Beiping, due to the tense situation in eastern Suiyuan, have decided to collectively fast for one day on the 15th to use the money saved to comfort the soldiers defending the territory, and have made a brocade banner to send personnel back to Suiyuan to present to Fu Zuoyi to pay their respects. (Central News Agency Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Suiyuan Province is tense. After the puppet troops of bandits in northern Chahar concentrated in Shangdu and Bailingmiao, the puppet troops in Weichang in northern Jehol and Dagugezhen in western Rehe have begun to move towards the Chahar border. According to reports from Suiyuan to Beiping, the bandit puppet troops and Mongolian troops in Bailingmiao and Shangdu total over 40,000. Most of them have completed their assembly. New-style weapons have been transported to the Kangbao area. It is rumored that the bandit puppet troops will launch a large-scale invasion around the 20th of this month after the deployment is completed. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Former Zhili-Lu Army commander Cheng Guorui, along with puppet brigade commander Hong Xihua and chief of staff Wang Huchen, are currently secretly active in Tianjin. Liu Ziqing, former commander of the Fourth Division of the Zhili-Lu Army, has departed from Changchun for Tianjin, carrying a large sum of money, intending to gather old Zhili-Lu Army troops in southern Hebei and eastern Shandong to form three puppet divisions to echo the bandits in eastern Suiyuan. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Ying and Bao Yueqing visited a certain military commander at Zhang Garden mansion on the morning of the 9th, introduced by a certain foreign military attache, and had important negotiations. In the afternoon, Wang and others visited Liu Guitang at his private residence on Penglai Street to negotiate the incorporation of Liu's bandits in Chahar.

<p>(Beiping) The puppet troops of bandits in northern Chahar plan to invade Suiyuan Province from Shangdu and Bailingmiao simultaneously around the 20th of this month. Li Shouxin is responsible for the vanguard of the eastern route in Shangdu, and Wang Ying's cavalry bandits are the vanguard of the northern route in Bailingmiao. The foreign airfield still uses Dolun as its base, and there are currently more than 20 aircraft, which conduct reconnaissance in eastern and northern Suiyuan and the Alxa League every day. Zhangbei, Shangdu, Baochang, and Bailingmiao all have repaired airfields, but only foreign aircraft temporarily land. If necessary, an aircraft hangar may be set up in Shangdu. Due to the military impact on transportation in the Bailingmiao area, prices of all goods are expensive, and coal and rice are in short supply. Staff of foreign agencies working in Bailingmiao feel life is difficult and work is difficult. It is heard that most of the staff have applied to their superiors for leave to return east.

<p>(Tianjin) Zeng Yan'yi went to Song Zheyuan at No. 133, 17th Road, in the British Concession on the morning of the 9th, representing Fu Zuoyi to discuss border defense matters in Chahar and Suiyuan. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining reports that the situation is tight in Wuchuan and Xinghe. The cavalry of Wang Ying's puppet army and the Mongolian cavalry are gathering in Bailingmiao. The bandit's strategy of harassing the border seems to be shifting from the front to the flank. Two squadrons of foreign aircraft have recently arrived in Shangdu and are constantly circling the border between Mongolia and Suiyuan for reconnaissance. Tian Shumei, commander of western Suiyuan, went to Guihua on the 7th to visit Fu Zuoyi to discuss strict defense measures. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mongolian people living near Bailingmiao have recently been suffering from frequent mobilization of Mongolian puppet troops, requisitioning people's carts, horses, grain, and fodder. In addition, the puppet bandits of Li Shouxin and others have also concentrated in Bailingmiao, making them feel even more uneasy. They have specially appealed to Jebtsundamba Khutuktu and Prince De to request the prevention of bandit troops from entering the border to relieve the suffering of the people. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to related sources, after the Chahar bandit Wang Ying was repelled from invading eastern Suiyuan, the foreign side was quite dissatisfied with Wang Ying. Li Shouxin's puppet troops from Jehol were stationed in the Daqinggou area, ostensibly to strengthen their forces, but in reality to monitor Wang. Currently, the Chahar-Suiyuan border is snowing, and the climate is extremely cold. Moreover, due to the extreme shortage of provisions, the bandits are extremely panicked internally, and Wang's attitude is very passive. In addition, the Mongolian people near Bailingmiao are suffering greatly because many Mongolian puppet troops have come, and the supply of carts, horses, grain, and fodder is huge. They have appealed to Prince De to request a halt to this situation. (Central News Agency Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Suiyuan provincial authorities are actively consolidating their northern defenses because the Mongolian "Manchu" army has apparently changed its direction of attack. Wang Ying's Mongolian army and Li Shouxin's "Manchu" army, seeing that the defenses in eastern Suiyuan are very strong, have changed their direction to advance towards Bailingmiao in an attempt to outflank Suiyuan. It is expected that the Mongolian "Manchu" army will use Bailingmiao and Shangdu as bases, launching attacks simultaneously on the northeast two fronts. The northeast two fronts have been quiet since the small conflicts a few days ago. (Reuters Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, due to the resolution of the meeting, the opinions of both sides still failed to reach a consensus.

It is heard that Foreign Minister Zhang may meet with Kawagoe at his official residence on the afternoon of the 10th. (Central News Agency Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The seventh meeting between Zhang and Kawagoe has been postponed due to some reason and is scheduled to be held at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 3:00 PM on the 10th. However, judging from the general situation, the future of the negotiations is difficult to predict, so the progress of the meeting on the 10th is extremely noteworthy.

<p>(Nanjing) Since the sixth meeting between Kawagoe and Zhang Qun on the 26th of last month, only two preparatory negotiations have been held by Suma and Takazō, and no conclusion has been reached. Although the time for resolution is impossible to predict, it is not advisable to delay the matter due to the importance of the current situation.

<h3 id="e5">American Media Tycoon Says, "The Sleeping Lion of China Has Awakened; All Countries in Europe and America Must Look at Each Other With New Eyes; China Will Never Concede to Japan" <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Manila) Mr. Howaide, chief editor of world telegrams for American media mogul New, arrived here from San Francisco on the first passenger plane of Pacific Airways. He will return to the United States today on the China Clipper. Before his departure, he stated that the tide of Japanese aggression against China has now reached its highest point. Whether this tide has actually begun to recede will be seen in the next few weeks. As things stand, if China and Japan do not immediately go to war, they can agree on the basis for long-term peace. China has expressed a firm position towards Japan, and a dramatic turn is imminent. European and American countries must look at China's stunning completion of restoration and unification with new eyes. In other words, the judgment and evaluation of China by Europeans and Americans in the past must be readjusted.</p>
<p>After arriving here, Howaide traveled to Hong Kong by Pacific Airways clipper and then changed to a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Shanghai and Beiping. During his time in China, he met with Chinese dignitaries and foreign envoys to discuss the Far Eastern situation. The above excerpt is the result of this trip. Howaide also stated that three years ago, when Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was stationed in Nanchang, supervising the campaign to suppress the communists, he told him that at that time, the country was not yet unified and the military was not yet sufficient. By last year, Chairman Chiang told him again in Nanjing that the Chinese communists had been defeated, and the unification of the north and south and the national revival were about to be completed. Today, the unification, which foreigners considered impossible, has been completed and is unshakable. In terms of territory, from Guangzhou to Beiping; in terms of people, from small workers to tycoons, they will resolutely and wholeheartedly cooperate to resist any aggression or any attempt to harm China's sovereignty. Three years ago, when Japan made demands on China, the Chinese people gave their army only broadswords. Until last week, when the Japanese government made some suggestions to China, people from all over China congratulated Chairman Chiang on his fiftieth birthday with dozens of the latest model aircraft. From broadswords to aircraft, one can see the evolution of the Sino-Japanese situation. In a word, the sleeping lion of China has now awakened.</p>
<p>A tense situation and the threat of war have been commonplace in China, but today the situation is very different. European and American countries must look at the awakened lion of the Far East with new eyes. The Chinese people and students no longer merely advocate war. Leaders in various places, while praying for peace, do not forget to actively prepare for war. The number of demands made by Japan on China has gradually decreased, which proves that Japan has also recognized China's progress. As for the two basic conditions currently put forward by Japan, one is joint anti-communism and the other is formal recognition of the special status of North China, the first requires recognition that the Japanese army can cooperate with the Chinese army in various parts of China, which is tantamount to recognizing the legal right of the Japanese army to be stationed in China, and the second is actually undermining China's unity, both of which are difficult to recognize. As for the situation in Suiyuan, it can be said that it is on the verge of explosion. If the Japanese army carries out aggression against the province, Chairman Chiang will certainly use force to deal with it. In terms of Sino-Russian relations, although they have common interests in certain circumstances, the Chinese authorities have denied the claim that China and Russia will take joint action against Japan. Chiang Kai-shek's deep hatred of the Communist Party and his unwillingness to cause a backlash from Britain and the United States can be seen. However, if a war breaks out, it will be another matter. Furthermore, China has made some reciprocal demands on Japan, which shows that China has also adopted an offensive posture in its diplomacy with Japan. Howaide concluded by saying that he personally believes that Japan will avoid a quick war, while China is sharpening its sword and no longer retreating. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

Wallace, director of the Overseas Trade Bureau of the Department of Commerce, replied that Kirk's duty is to examine suggestions involving commercial loans on the spot, conduct necessary investigations, and then report in detail to the Export Credit Guarantee Department for decision. Although Kirk is directly responsible to the Export Credit Guarantee Department, he will be one of the staff members of the British Ambassador to China and subject to the ambassador's control. Wallace also said that the government is deeply aware of the importance of the Chinese market. Dr. asked then whether the amount of the loan was limited. Wallace replied that it would be limited according to usual commercial practices. (Reuters Telegram, 9th)</p>

He concluded by saying that in recent years, China's political and social aspects have progressed extremely rapidly, various business organizations have become increasingly complete, the division of labor has become increasingly refined, and the people's interest in public undertakings and group organizations has become increasingly strong. The ability and experience in handling groups have also increased a lot, which is indeed a very good phenomenon in modern countries. However, it is hoped that everyone will further pay attention to the formation of the entire national organization, the habit of observing discipline, and seek a way out for the country.

<p>(Nanjing) Since the assassination case occurred during the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee on November 1st of last year, sixteen suspects have been arrested.

<p>(Nanjing) The case of the murder of American woman Xu Wan Suzhen, which was discovered between Beijige and Wumiao Bay Jiuyan Well on October 15th of last year, has finally been solved after a year. The murderer has been arrested in Heita Village, Sixian, and will be transferred to the court for interrogation within the month. The process of solving this case was arduous and quite interesting. After the incident, it was learned that the deceased was Xu Wan Suzhen, the wife of Xu Shiju, a technician at the Department of Health. The police and military authorities immediately dispatched investigators, but due to the bizarre nature of the case, despite numerous investigations, it was impossible to solve the case for a time. Detective Yu Zhongchi, who devoted a year of painstaking research, finally solved the case. It turned out that there was a rickshaw puller named Liu Rongxing in Nanjing, 34 years old, who served in the army in his early years. After being discharged, he made a living pulling a rickshaw, pulling a rickshaw at the entrance of the Central Hospital every day. Xu, the victim in this case, also worked in the hospital and regularly hired a rickshaw from the entrance to go in and out in the morning and evening. On the evening of October 14th last year, Ms. Xu was carrying a large sum of legal tender in her suitcase. Liu Rongxing clearly saw this and was immediately tempted. He then rushed out of his peers to solicit business, and Ms. Xu, without paying attention, took Liu's rickshaw. When they arrived in the Chengxian Street Huo Che Lu area, the sky was dim, and the fields were deserted. Liu thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so he stopped and did not advance. He quickly pulled out a belt from his side and strangled Ms. Xu's throat from behind. Ms. Xu immediately cried out loudly. Liu was anxious and stepped forward to strangle the woman's throat to prevent her from making a sound. The unfortunate American woman died tragically under Beijige. At that time, a car suddenly drove by on the side of the road. Fearing that he would be discovered, Liu was desperate and clever. He dragged the body as usual until he reached the uninhabited area of ​​Wumiao Bay Jiuyan Well under Beijige. He dragged the body off the rickshaw, abandoned it there, and after searching for valuables, he hurriedly fled. The case was discovered on the morning of the 15th. The police reported it to the court for inspection and conducted an investigation according to law. After many days, the case was not solved. Detective Yu Zhongchi believed that it was done by a rickshaw puller. Later, he discovered that one of the rickshaw pullers who usually worked in front of the hospital was suddenly missing. Yu was even more convinced that it must be the rickshaw puller. By this point, although there was a lead on the murderer, he had already fled. There was no way to search. So Yu used the clue to continue investigating in various directions. Later, he learned that the criminal was hiding in Heita Village, Sixian. Yu disguised himself and went there, pretending to be a bandit, mingling and wandering with the bandits from morning to night. One day, he suddenly saw a person who looked like the criminal Liu. Yu immediately went forward and feigned conversation. He saw Liu wearing a platinum ring on his finger, which was the same as the one lost by the deceased. Yu was convinced that the bandit was Liu Rongxing, the murderer in this case. So, he tricked Liu into a secluded place and worked with the county police to arrest Liu and escort him to the county. The Sixian government sent a team to escort him to Beijing last month. Thus, the evil spirit who killed for money was finally captured, and the case was also solved. It can truly be said that the net of heaven is vast, and nothing escapes its meshes. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e58">After the Spanish Government Moved its Capital <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, it has been almost four months. Recently, with the relocation of the Spanish government to Valencia and the rebel army's heavy siege of Madrid, the development of the civil war has reached a critical juncture. Although the Spanish government's defense of Madrid has shown awe-inspiring and heroic performance, it is feared that the fall of this precarious city into the hands of the rebels is only a matter of time. After the Spanish government moves its capital to Valencia and the rebel army enters Madrid, how will the Spanish civil war develop? This is a question worthy of close attention.</p>
<p>First, from the domestic perspective, the Spanish government's abandonment of the capital, Madrid, does not mean that the civil war is about to end. This has been made very clear in the declaration issued by the Spanish government after holding its first cabinet meeting in the new capital. "Our relocation to Valencia does not mean that we are giving up Madrid, nor does it mean that we are retreating. Our relocation is precisely to adjust the forces defending the capital of Madrid." At the same time, the Spanish Embassy in France also issued a similar declaration, stating that the real war is just beginning and citing the example of the German army approaching Paris during the Great War of 1914, when the French government temporarily moved to Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast to continue the fight and eventually turned danger into safety and defeat into victory, explaining that "the Spanish government has now decided to follow the policy of the French government at that time and adopt the tactic of encircling from the outside until the final victory is achieved." We can infer from the official documents of the Spanish government that the Spanish civil war will not end with the fall of Madrid. Even from the current position of the government, the civil war will not end there. On the contrary, it may become more intense. Because although most of the western land of Spain has fallen into the hands of the rebels, the rich areas along the Mediterranean Sea and other industrial and commercial centers, such as Biscay, Santander, Asturias, Catalonia, Cordoba, and Valencia, are still in the hands of the government. The government still has the ability to engage in a final showdown with the rebels. At the same time, the people who support the government are the mortal enemies of the fascist rebels. They will never surrender without a fight because they know that when the rebels rule the entire country, it will be their day of death. Therefore, judging from the above situations, the Spanish civil war will enter a more intense stage with the relocation of the government.</p>
<p>As for foreign relations, the fall of Madrid will have a significant impact and further sharpen the international struggle surrounding the Spanish civil war. We all know that behind the Spanish rebels, there is assistance from Italy and Germany. The fall of Madrid can also be said to have been captured by Germany and Italy. There is no doubt that after the rebels enter the capital and organize a new government, Italy, Germany, and Portugal will immediately recognize it. Guido, the spokesperson for the Blackshirt Prime Minister, said in a commentary in the Italian Daily on the 8th, "The Spanish National Military Government should be recognized by the government of a certain European country that is most rational." This so-called most rational government is naturally the governments of Italy and Germany. Although countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will not recognize the rebel government, if Italy and Germany recognize the rebel government, they can recognize it as the legitimate government of Spain and develop a closer relationship with it. They may even openly supply the rebel government with arms because they can say that this is permitted by international law. This is the opposite of the unfair treatment currently suffered by the Spanish government and will inevitably cause a serious backlash. Therefore, the international disputes over the Spanish situation will inevitably increase with the fall of Madrid.</p>
<p>When we observe the development of the Spanish civil war, we cannot help but think of the inappropriateness of the current international arms embargo. The non-intervention agreement treats the legitimate government of Spain the same as the rebels. This not only violates international law but is also unreasonable. Similarly, if the international community imposes the same arms embargo on aggressors and victims of aggression (such as the initial resolution of the League of Nations on the Italian-Ethiopian war and the US embargo), it is also an act against justice. We, who are in the position of being invaded, should not only oppose this unfair international arms embargo for the sake of our future interests, but also oppose the non-intervention agreement that binds the legitimate government of Spain. Because opposing that kind of unfair non-intervention approach is also for the sake of increasing our strength to resist aggression in the future.</p>

<p>The British government previously suggested to the governments of the United States and Japan to retain Article 20 of the Washington Naval Treaty, which stipulates that defense should not be increased in the Pacific. According to a report from a New York Times correspondent, the US government rejected this proposal at the end of September, stating that if this proposal is linked to the neutrality of the Philippines or used to adjust the entire Far East issue, the United States is willing to conduct discussions. The US government believes that maintaining this article is not appropriate as a separate issue, and explained that one of the reasons for its rejection is related to the US Far East policy. The State Department believes that the interests of the United States in the Far East must rely on a non-aggressive policy that is easily subject to diplomatic treatment and must also be guaranteed by sufficient naval power and defense projects. It is reported that although the Japanese government has not made a final decision on the British proposal, according to the Japanese Daily News, the Japanese government will also reject it.

<h3 id="e60">British Aviation Develops Rapidly <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Imperial Postal Aviation, which starts from London's Croydon Airport, has made astonishing achievements in recent years. Its progress will be unpredictable after the implementation of the airmail system in April next year. Currently, the average airmail volume shipped from Croydon every week is three and three-quarters tons, equivalent to about 350,000 letters. The above amount does not include mail from European countries, which can be described as huge. Recalling the initial establishment in 1931, the total mail volume for the entire year was only hundreds of thousands. It is believed that this year's Christmas airmail will create a new record, surpassing the five tons of last year by a considerable margin. According to the new airmail system, ordinary letters weighing no more than half an ounce only need to pay ordinary postage to be sent by Imperial Airways to various parts of the British Empire. This plan has made the Imperial Airways route the largest commercial aviation business in the world. Currently, Imperial Airways has ordered as many as twenty-nine giant airships, each weighing eighteen tons, equipped with four engines, totaling four thousand horsepower. The airship has 24 seats, 16 beds, and can carry several tons of mail. The "Canopus" airship has been built and will be in service on the Mediterranean route a month later. It is also reported that after the implementation of this new plan, the aviation time to various parts of the British Empire can be shortened. For example, it currently takes twelve days to fly to Australia, but it will only take eight days after the new plan is implemented. India currently takes five days and will also be shortened to two and a half days. (Reuters dispatch dated 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e62">French Socialist Party Congress Endorses Current Cabinet Policy: Premier's Speech Only the Soviet Union is Not Reliable; Ready to Take Unified Action; Democratic Alliance Congress Concludes <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The National Congress of the Socialist Party recently passed a motion expressing sincere trust in Prime Minister Léon Blum and other Socialist cabinet members, and approving the policies implemented by the current government. Prior to this, Prime Minister Léon Blum delivered a speech at the Congress, mentioning the Spanish issue, and briefly stated that the non-intervention agreement was fortunately established, otherwise the Spanish civil strife would have expanded into a general European war, and France's position relying solely on the Soviet Union for assistance would inevitably be extremely precarious. If there is a possibility of unified action between Britain and France, he is prepared to cooperate with Britain. Mentioning the relationship between Britain, France, and the United States, he said that the relationship between the three countries is extremely good recently. Mentioning the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, he said that its value is still completely intact. Finally, mentioning domestic issues, he said that he firmly believes in the organization of the Popular Front, and that the Communist Party's full support for the current government in Congress is admirable for its spirit of cooperation.

<p>The Democratic Union Party led by former Prime Minister Pierre-Étienne Flandin held a national congress here from the 6th of this month, and it was announced today that it has concluded. Before the closing, the congress reporter, incumbent Senator Baudeuin, announced the program resolved by the congress, such as (1) respecting private property, (2) respecting the inviolability of private residences, (3) respecting the freedom to work, (4) adopting a policy of cultivating young cadres, (5) using national labor to implement large-scale social programs to restore economic prosperity, etc. After the closing of the congress, representatives of the Democratic Union Party held a banquet. Flandin gave a speech at the banquet, briefly stating that the political theory of interventionism has gradually emerged (it is believed that this refers to the Spanish incident), and the results it will bring will increase the danger of war. Those in power should understand that their mission is to serve the republic, not a certain class. In addition, our party supports the holding of re-elections in Congress, but only on the condition that an electoral law based on a full proportional representation system is implemented. Finally, Flandin added that some people believe that France will have only two paths in the future, either revolution or dictatorship. This statement is extremely absurd. The only thing the French people want is peace. (Havas dispatch dated 8th)</p>

<p>(London) A hurricane suddenly broke out in the English Channel today, followed by a terrible thunderstorm. When the hurricane reached Folkestone, its speed reached 100 miles per hour. Giant waves often invaded the harbor. Residents of Dungeness claimed that the terror of the evening was unprecedented in their lives. All ferries operating in the Channel were suspended, and many ships remained in Cherbourg. The White Star Line giant ship "Queen Mary" rescued the German steamship "Axis", which had an accident due to the hurricane, on its way back to England from the United States. The ship eventually sank in the Atlantic Ocean, 400 miles from Land's End. The British Company ship "Viceroy of India" received a radio message from the German ship "West Island" stating that the ship had rescued a small boat carrying one person, but the whereabouts of the "Axis" were never seen. After rescuing the small boat, the "West Island" abandoned its voyage. The "Queen Mary" is expected to arrive in Cherbourg this afternoon. According to a report from the captain of the German ship "West Island", the survivor rescued was a 17-year-old servant from the "Axis". According to the servant, the "Axis" had sunk, and he believed that all 39 people on board had drowned. (Reuters dispatch dated 9th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar: Although Madrid has been repeatedly attacked by the National Army in the past 24 hours, the entire city is still in the hands of the government army. It is reported that the government army is still confronting the enemy on the banks of the Manzanares River in western Madrid. The National Army initially announced that it had occupied the Segovia Bridge and the Princess Bridge on the Manzanares River. It is reported that both bridges are currently guarded by the government army and are in fierce battle with the enemy. According to a Reuters special correspondent in the National Army, the battle on the outskirts of Madrid is the fiercest since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. The militiamen guard the solid trenches, and their courage and determination are truly admirable. Although they were attacked by the National Army Air Force and artillery fire yesterday, they were still able to stop the advance of the Moorish troops. According to a long-distance telephone message from a Reuters correspondent stationed in Madrid, the bombing and bombing in the capital this time has resulted in more than 200 deaths and injuries. Yesterday afternoon, bombs fell like rain, and shells fell around Trafalgar Square and the Cibeles Square, where the Army Department, Air Force Department, and the Bank of Spain are located. Shops in the city have been closed, and only cafes are still open. Today, a battalion of militiamen with new military equipment and a team of navy, totaling 400 people, lined up to guard the city's defense works, and the people shouted, "Long live the Republic" to welcome them. If the National Army enters the center of the capital, it is expected that there will be a fierce street battle and hand-to-hand combat. Even one alley and one house will not be easily given up. (Reuters dispatch dated 9th)</p>
<p>Suburbs of Madrid: According to a Reuters special correspondent in the National Army, the battle to capture Madrid, until the evening of the second day, although the National Army made significant breakthroughs in the government army's positions, it still failed to cross the Manzanares River or occupy any bridges on the river. (Reuters dispatch dated 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Today, four rebel bombers dropped twelve bombs on the city, killing at least nine people and injuring two hundred, many of whom are in critical condition. At the same time, rebel heavy artillery bombarded the city's palace and other places, causing some deaths and injuries. Currently, there are no statistics. The military committee in charge of defending the city is still urging the people not to retreat in the slightest. Today's fiercest battle was on the banks of the Manzanares River, where government troops had deep trenches and used tanks to assist in the battle. It is reported that a large number of rebel troops are still in the suburbs and are preparing to destroy the Toledo and Segovia bridges. Two bombs fell near the office of the Associated Press correspondent today, killing eight women and children who had taken refuge in a church there. (National Electric dispatch dated 8th)</p>
<p>Southern Suburbs of Madrid: The National Army yesterday arranged artillery positions between the Toledo Bridge and the Princess Bridge, and continuously bombarded the government army's positions. Most of the houses in the area north of the Toledo Bridge were hit and caught fire. They are still burning this morning. The government army excavated three trenches opposite the Toledo Bridge and guarded them with all their strength. Furthermore, solid defenses were built in front of the trenches, and barbed wire was laid in front of them for protection. The National Army was unable to enter for a while, so it changed its direction and attacked the northwest of Madrid. However, the government troops there also tried their best to counterattack without retreating in the slightest. Therefore, it is still questionable whether the National Army has entered Madrid. Looking at the situation in the Madrid area, the National Army has a total of four divisions, while the government army has 60,000 militiamen. Although they lack artillery, they are still guarding the northwest, south, and southeast of Madrid, and are not retreating. (Havas dispatch dated 9th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The National Army officially declared today that it has not yet entered Madrid, but is holding the positions it occupied last night and is reinforcing its left wing because 20,000 militiamen had counterattacked the left wing of the National Army. It also said that because there is a strong wind and rain in Madrid, it has to postpone the attack and can only continue to fight when the weather clears. (Reuters dispatch dated 9th)</p>

<p>Madrid: The Spanish government has dispatched news reports stating that Madrid, "not yet captured," is today under fierce attack from the Nationalist forces by land and air. This attack, which began at 8:00 AM, has increased in intensity with each passing hour. As this dispatch is being filed, Nationalist and government aircraft are circling overhead, and many bombs are falling on the streets. Only a few citizens ventured out to work this morning, most remaining indoors to avoid being pulverized by the bombs. From the rooftops of tall buildings, the bursting of shells can be seen in Madrid's most bustling Puerta del Sol area, as well as other places. The famous eastern boulevard, the Calle de Alcalá, has also been struck by many shells. The Nationalist forces' primary targets are, of course, the government's administrative buildings, which have suffered the greatest damage. The number of casualties in the capital is currently unknown. Yesterday, Nationalist aircraft dropped many declarations over Madrid containing a message from General Franco, the commander-in-chief, stating that his troops would enter the capital tomorrow, and that women, children, and foreign embassies and consulates would be treated with special respect. All of Madrid's shops are closed this morning, except for milk and coal shops, which are open as usual, with large numbers of women queuing outside to buy. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Multiple Nationalist aircraft flew over the city at 9:00 AM today and dropped bombs, but no damage was caused. Later, at 3:30 PM, more aircraft arrived in formation. The sky was cloudy, which favored the air raid, so they bombed heavily. Simultaneously, the Nationalist artillery also unleashed its power. Land shells and aerial bombs rained down, with the central district, especially near the central market, receiving the most hits. The explosions shook the area far and wide, and countless houses were destroyed. A bomb also fell and exploded near the French Embassy. The number of casualties is currently unknown, but it is likely to exceed the 300 killed when Madrid was bombed by aircraft on the 30th of last month. The injured are being taken to hospitals by ambulances. At the same time, the government's air defenses were highly active, with anti-aircraft guns and machine guns firing thousands of rounds. Multiple government aircraft also took off and chased the enemy aircraft in the clouds, creating a dramatic aerial battle. Despite their fear, many residents forgot themselves and looked up to watch. The Nationalist aircraft, fearing being hit by machine gun fire, retreated for a time, but soon returned. The aircraft from both sides were engaged in close combat in the air, making it difficult to distinguish between government and Nationalist planes. After a period of intense fighting, neither side managed to shoot down an aircraft, so no victor was declared. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Twelve Nationalist aircraft bombed the city extensively yesterday. So far, it has been confirmed that over ten people have died and more than 150 have been injured, but the total number is still unknown. Most of the bombs dropped by the aircraft fell on main thoroughfares. Several bombs also struck the gardens of the former Royal Palace. One bomb hit the North Railway Station, killing one employee. Another bomb struck a monastery (which has been converted into a refugee shelter). One bomb fell near the Chilean Embassy, and another struck the Central Police Station, injuring four police officers. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Government troops have been engaged in fierce fighting with rebel forces in the outskirts of the city for several days, relying heavily on the militia. Our correspondent has learned of an incident on the front lines that demonstrates the militia's heroic response. When both sides were engaged in a fierce battle in Carabanchel yesterday, the rebel artillery fire was extremely intense, and the morale of the militia began to waver. Their leader, a member of the Communist Party, saw this and immediately ordered a counter-offensive. Upon hearing the order, the militia members sang "The Internationale" and advanced bravely. On the way, they encountered six rebel tanks, which fired machine guns that rained down like bullets. One militia member, disregarding his own safety, jumped forward and threw several hand grenades at the tanks, destroying four of them. By the time the other militia members followed, the young militia member had already sacrificed himself. Inspired by this, the morale of the militia was boosted, and they advanced together, eventually driving back the rebel forces. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar: An oil tank fire occurred today in Almirra, near Malaga, on the Mediterranean coast, with flames soaring over 500 feet high. It is believed that the fire was caused by bombing by Nationalist aircraft and shelling by the cruiser "Canarias I". It is said that the large oil tanks currently burning contain a total of one million gallons of kerosene and diesel. The tanks are located north of the Almirra seawall and are owned by the CAMPSA company, which holds a monopoly in Spain. It is reported that the company's gas plant and power plant have also been hit by bombs. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in Vienna for a Tripartite Conference <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Vienna: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here today on an official visit, drawing great attention from the local community. It is said that Ciano is carrying a letter from Mussolini expressing his wishes regarding Austria's future policy towards Germany. Ciano, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg, and Hungarian Foreign Minister Dr. Kanya will hold a meeting on Wednesday. It is expected that Austria and Hungary will formally announce their recognition of the Italian East African Empire after the meeting. At the same time, Mussolini's closeness to German leader Hitler has caused speculation among some circles in Austria, who now claim that only the restoration of the Habsburg imperial family can protect Austria from the influence of the National Socialist Party. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Vienna: After arriving here last night, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano paid visits this morning to President Miklas, Chancellor Schuschnigg, and Foreign Minister Schmidt, among other important figures. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Vienna: As the tripartite conference of the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers is about to begin, it has been learned that the issue of the restoration of the Austrian Habsburg imperial family is not on the agenda. Even during the preliminary talks between Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano and the Austrian authorities before the meeting, there are no plans to discuss this issue. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Vienna): Regarding the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg imperial family, official sources here recently stated that this is purely an internal matter for Austria and should not be interfered with by other countries. However, given the current international situation, it would be inappropriate to raise this issue directly at the tripartite conference of the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers. Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano will also not mention it during his preliminary talks with the Austrian authorities. Moreover, German leader Hitler opposes this move, leaving no room for compromise. As Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has been in contact with the government of Yugoslavia, and Yugoslavia is also strongly opposed to it, Mussolini is seeking to get closer to Yugoslavia and hopes to form a common front with Germany diplomatically. Therefore, he is unwilling to hastily submit the issue of Austrian restoration for discussion at the tripartite conference. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>(London): A special correspondent for the Daily Mail in Rome, Mr. Playfair, interviewed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday regarding Anglo-Italian relations and Italy's relationship with Spanish Nationalist leader General Franco. The Prime Minister answered each question in detail. The questions and answers are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Playfair asked:) What specific measures does the Prime Minister intend to adopt to improve Anglo-Italian relations? (Mussolini replied:) "I wish for a gentleman's agreement to be established between Britain and Italy." (Asked:) Does the Prime Minister intend to divide the spheres of influence of Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean or to conclude a non-aggression pact between the two countries?</p>
<p>(Answered:) "Such measures would inevitably lead to new disputes. Moreover, countries have been concluding treaties one after another recently, like having the plague. I do not wish to encourage this trend. Furthermore, the interests of Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean not only do not conflict but are complementary. Therefore, neither side has any reason to be hostile to the other in the Mediterranean. The gentleman's agreement that I hope to conclude must mutually protect the interests of both parties and must therefore become a kind of mutual agreement, the nature of which must be fully understood and accepted by all other countries along the Mediterranean coast."</p>
<p>(Asked:) "Many people in Britain believe that the Prime Minister has already reached a secret understanding with Spanish Nationalist leader General Franco, that Italy will show sympathy during the Nationalist forces' war, and that after success, General Franco will cede the island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean (belonging to the Balearic Islands) to Italy as an Italian naval base. Is this true?"</p>
<p>(Answered:) "Regarding the issue of the island of Mallorca, I can clearly tell you that we have never had this in mind. And in fact, if a Nationalist leader in Spain were to consider the issue of ceding his country's territory at this time, I would not dare to respect such a leader." (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>Munich: German leader Hitler delivered a speech in Munich today on the 13th anniversary of the Munich Putsch, stating that no one except the absolutely insane could fail to believe that the National Socialist movement would last forever. Hitler was warmly welcomed by the old party members upon his arrival. The speech was delivered in the beer cellar where he had made a request to local officials thirteen years ago that was not granted. Hitler also stated that the new German army will fight and sacrifice for the motherland when the time comes, and then the world will see that within Germany, a cultural bulwark has been built to stop the rampage of the red and Jewish Bolsheviks. Interior Minister Frick has ordered the entire country to participate in today's commemoration ceremony and has advised the people not to engage in unnecessary entertainment. Ludendorff and Göring were also key figures in the uprising. After Hitler's request was rejected, he led tens of thousands of party members from the beer hall in the city center. Göring was in the second row of the procession. When they reached the Isar Bridge, a police team stopped them, raising their guns as if to shoot. Göring saw this and stepped forward, saying, "If anyone dares to shoot at us, everyone we have in custody will die a terrible death." Upon hearing this, the police did not dare to move, and the procession continued as usual until it reached the large hall in the city center, when someone opened fire on them. Hitler and others returned fire. The National Socialist Party's first uprising ended in failure. Two days later, Hitler was arrested. The following spring, Hitler was imprisoned in Landsberg. In his boredom, Hitler began to write a book to pass the time. The book "Mein Kampf," which has now been published, was written at that time. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Amoy Correspondence: The Japanese have recently been paying close attention to the governance and organization of Japanese residents from Taiwan residing in Amoy. For example, the Japanese consulate in Amoy has been upgraded to a general consulate. Furthermore, due to the promotion of the Japanese consulate, the Amoy Taiwan Residents Association (i.e., the Taiwan Association) established the "Self-Denial Society" organization under the premise of "following the will of the Japanese Emperor". It is scheduled to hold the "National Spiritual Revival Assembly" on the 10th of this month at the Xu Ying Academy on Minguo Road. Moreover, from the 7th to the 13th, it has been designated as "Revival Week", with the aim of encouraging residents to save on expenses and contribute to the Japanese nation. The four slogans are: (1) Do not drink or smoke, (2) Do not take the car unless there is an accident, (3) Get up early and climb the mountain, (4) Donate the saved funds to the "Service Box". In addition, the national concept of the residents is enhanced, and residents and merchants are required to hang the Japanese flag uniformly on every festival to show respect. The "Self-Denial Society" is scheduled to hold the "National Spiritual Revival Assembly" every November 10, and the 10th of each month is "Self-Denial Day". Members must pay attention to improving their lives, correcting bad habits, and not collecting membership fees, but when business requires expenses, the Residents Association will be asked to subsidize them. Multiple "Service Boxes" are set up to allow members to deposit savings into the boxes, which are opened and accounted for every month and stored in the Bank of Taiwan, so that they can be dedicated to national public cars at the appropriate time. "Service Boxes" are also set up in 13 locations in Amoy City, including the association's office and the offices of the Third and Sixth Districts. The above-mentioned Third and Sixth District offices are divided into districts in Amoy according to the autonomous organization of the Taiwan Association, just like our country's Baogjia districts. The Japanese have always had a very strict control and organization of Taiwanese people in Amoy, and the establishment of this association will further emphasize their psychological aspects.

<h3 id="e81">The Achievements of Nanjing's Emerging Industry, Quan Hua Soy Sauce Factory; New Methods of Soy Sauce Production in Large Quantities; Rich in Nutrients and Hygienic <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Soy sauce is a daily necessity for people's lives. It has always been manufactured using old methods, which not only wastes time and increases costs, but also often makes it difficult for the nutrients it contains to meet hygiene standards due to various factors. Therefore, the import of foreign soy sauce has increased sharply. The national soy sauce market is in danger of being encroached upon and is in a precarious situation. According to customs statistics, the total amount of foreign soy sauce imported in recent years, for ordinary soy sauce alone, has reached 643,141 dan, estimated at a huge value of 4,600,247 customs taels. The outflow of wealth is shocking. Industrialists with a sense of responsibility, in view of this, established the Quan Hua Soy Sauce Brewery in Nanjing last year, using new methods to manufacture and produce in large quantities to meet the needs of society. Before setting up the factory, they sent personnel abroad to investigate and learn from them. The following is a record of the general situation of the factory:</p>
<p>A Glimpse Inside the Factory</p>
<p>The factory is located outside the Hanxi Gate in the capital, at the Second Dike. The buildings are newly built and occupy a large area. All the equipment is very complete. The factory is divided into several parts, including steam, koji cultivation, koji production, fermentation, pressing, disinfection, analysis, and syrup production. All the machines are powered by steam and electricity. The steam pot for boiling beans in the steam room is as high as the roof, and its capacity is rare. The fermentation tanks are made of cement and have a total of ten tanks, each with a capacity of 80 dan of koji, and 32 small tanks, each with a capacity of 36 dan. The electric oven for baking wheat and the flour mill are unique features.</p>
<p>The Process of Soy Sauce</p>
<p>The ingredients of soy sauce are mainly soybeans, wheat, salt, and purified water. Although the soy sauce making process in this factory is all done by machine, the soy sauce time can be shortened, but the procedure is more complicated than that of the old method. For example, soybeans must be washed several times after soaking before being poured into a steam pot for steaming. The water used must also be filtered with sand before being used. The manufacturing procedure is to first mix the steamed soybeans and roasted wheat flour together with the homemade soy sauce koji, and place it in a koji-making room at a certain temperature. After 36 hours, it can be made into soy sauce koji. After the koji is made, it is transferred to the fermentation tank and the dissolved refined salt liquid is introduced into the tank to ferment for more than two months. It is taken out and pressed by machine, and the original juice is raw soy sauce. However, it must still be boiled with high heat steam and disinfected in the tank before being bottled or canned. The bottles and cans are sterilized before the oil is filled. After the sauce is filled, the container must be sterilized once more before being capped and sealed.</p>
<p>Production and Sales</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shen, a technician at the factory, since our factory started manufacturing, it has not been a year, and the results have been considerable. The average monthly shipment is 3,000 dan, with the most sales in the capital and the ports along the Yangtze River. Because the production capacity has not been expanded, there is no surplus goods to supply to Shanghai. However, the catering department of the Two-Roads Administration and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line have already placed long-term orders.</p>
<p>Plans for Expansion</p>
<p>The factory's sales are increasing day by day, and there is a shortage of supply. We are actively expanding and plan to increase capital to several hundred thousand yuan. It is expected that if the expansion plan can be realized, the monthly production of soy sauce can reach 10,000 to 15,000 dan. We also plan to set up more management offices in various places to promote sales. The latest bottling equipment and pressing machines have been ordered from Britain and Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Guangdong Province Requests Revision of the Exchange Rate Between the Legal Tender and Guangdong Silver Coins, Arguing That the Addition of 1.5 Is An Excessive Undervaluation of Guangdong Currency, Especially Unfair Compared to the Treatment of Guangxi Province <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Guangdong merchants believe that ever since the central government set the exchange rate between the silver dollar and Guangdong silver coins at an addition of 1.5, this has excessively devalued the Guangdong silver coins. In fact, commodity prices have subsequently risen, causing hardship to the lives of the people. Recently, when the central government reorganized the currency of Guangxi Province, setting the exchange rate between Guangxi currency and the silver dollar at an addition of 1.6, this aroused concerns among Guangdong merchants. Guangxi currency is usually worth only 80% or less of Guangdong silver coins. Now, suddenly, its exchange rate with the silver dollar has been set at an addition of 1.6, while the exchange rate between Guangdong silver coins and the silver dollar remains at an addition of 1.5. This clearly raises the value of Guangxi currency and devalues Guangdong silver coins, causing great losses to Guangdong merchants. Therefore, at the proposal of the Salted Fish Guild and other associations, a meeting of merchants from various trades was convened at the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce on Yangan Street on the 2nd of this month to discuss remedial measures. More than 60 representatives from over 30 trades, including the Grain Industry, Public Bus Industry, Peanut and Sesame Industry, and Salted Fish Industry, attended. Zou Dianbang was elected as chairman, and he announced the reasons for the meeting. The issue of the exchange rate between the silver dollar and Guangdong silver coins was then discussed. It was immediately decided to request that the central government accept the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce's previous proposal to revise the exchange rate between the silver dollar and Guangdong silver coins to an addition of 1.228 or 1.3. A circular telegram was immediately drafted to appeal to all parties, and representatives were sent to petition the authorities. However, the Finance Department has not provided a concrete response because the addition of 1.5 was set by the Ministry of Finance, and this case should be resolved by the Ministry of Finance. The reasons given in the Chamber of Commerce's circular telegram are excerpted below (the above is omitted): Guangdong Province has always used silver coins as its standard. Since the implementation of the policy of accepting silver, the people can no longer use silver coins as before, and there is a ban on private possession. The central government calculated that the amount of silver coins issued by Guangdong Province was insufficient to offset the silver reserve fund and used this as the standard for determining the exchange rate. The people of Guangdong Province firmly believe that this determination is unfair. To be sure, the people of Guangdong Province have no right to interfere with the over-issuance of paper money, nor have they ever heard the central government publicly deny or disapprove of its measures, nor has it denied the existence of the former government of Guangdong. The former government of Guangdong was also a government under the rule of the central government. If the central government cannot correct its over-issuance, how can it impose this loss on the people of Guangdong Province? This is the first point that should be clarified. Also, the provincial bank has a reserve fund of 100 million yuan. Based on this comparison, the difference in funds is extremely large. However, this reserve fund is the amount of silver stored, as well as the public factories and various construction projects in Guangdong Province, which have all been overdrawn by the provincial bank. The value of these industrial reserve funds is far more than 100 million yuan. Former bank president Shen has reported that this serves as collateral for the province government's overdraft of over 90 million yuan, which can be included in the calculation of the fund. Therefore, the amount of banknotes issued by the provincial bank actually exceeds the amount of funds. Moreover, the value of real estate deposited by the provincial and municipal banks has not yet been included. This is the second point that should be clarified. The central government's handling of the exchange rate system of each province should be fair. It is not appropriate to give special considerations to one province and treat another differently. The value of Guangxi silver coins has always been less than 80% of Guangdong silver coins because the silver content of Guangxi silver is lower than that of Guangdong silver. Since Guangxi Province took over the management of silver and switched to using banknotes, its value is the same as when silver coins were used. If the exchange rate between the national currency and Guangxi currency is an addition of 1.6, then the Guangdong currency should be set at an addition of 1.28 when converting to national currency, so as to avoid unfairness. This is the third point that should be clarified. In view of the above three points, we request again that the exchange rate for converting Guangdong currency to national currency be reduced, using the relative value of Guangdong and Guangxi silver coins as the comparison standard (i.e., calculated as an addition of 1.28). Guangdong has such cash and the assessed value of the above-mentioned industries. Whether Guangxi has comparable reserves is unknown, and if this causes disappointment among the people of Guangdong, there is a deep concern that the administration is unfair," etc. (November 6)</p>

<p>Dinghai dispatch: The Zhejiang Fisheries Experiment Station previously submitted a request to build a small motor research and experimental vessel, and has been in contact with shipyards in Shanghai for construction. However, the construction costs have not yet been secured, and the project will take some time. Therefore, a merchant ship was chartered some time ago, slightly modified, and used as a temporary measure. It was test-sailed at the end of last month, carrying all the students of the fishery instructor training class attached to the station, led by teachers Xu Shangqing and others, to practice in Shenjiamen, Huludao, Putuo and other places. It is understood that the station considers marine surveys to be an essential task for promoting the fishing industry. In addition to sending staff to be stationed in Shengshan, Qingbin, Dachenshan, Nanji and other islands to periodically measure tides, water temperature, specific gravity and plankton, and record other marine conditions, it also plans to divide the coast into several areas, and during the fishing season, go to the fishing grounds to conduct on-site surveys of the number of fishing boats, fishing gear, catches, the extent of the fishing grounds, and the route of movement, etc., hoping to obtain detailed information and draw detailed illustrations as a compass for those engaged in the fishing industry. It has now appointed two technicians, Lin Shuyan and Wu Zhongyuan, together with technician Lin Maochun and technical assistant Huo Yibai, to drive the station's research and experimental vessel "Liping" and set off to various islands yesterday to begin work.</p>

<p>The Wuxian Construction Bureau believes that the various highways and important roads in each district are not yet connected, and transportation is not very convenient. Therefore, it plans to connect the roads. The planned roads include the Huangli Road from Huangdai to Likou, the Muxu Road from Mudu to Xukou, the Zhou Deng Road from Zhouzhuang to Dengcun, and the Muxing Road from Mudu to Hengjing. These four roads are all main rural roads, and their width is based on the passage of rickshaws. The Huangli Road connects to the Suchang Road, the Muxu and Muxing Roads connect to the Sumu Road, and the Zhou Deng Road connects to the Sujia Road. It has now been decided that the earthwork for the four roads will be done by the villagers along the routes, and the roadbeds will be built by the Construction Bureau. It also plans to extend the Muxing Road to Dongting Mountain.</p>

Several suspects have been arrested one after another and sent to the garrison headquarters for interrogation. Wang Yunsheng (also known as Wang the Monk), who lives in Shifosi Lane outside Banmen and runs a carriage business, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau the other day. Xu Renhuan and several others were also arrested at the same time. The Public Security Bureau has sent Wang Yunsheng and others to the Wuxi District Security Command for interrogation. The Carriage Industry Guild believes that Wang Yunsheng is a member of the guild and a legitimate businessman, so it submitted a petition to the Second District Security Command on the 9th, requesting his release. The Shangtangdu and Sengliangzhen Township Offices also submitted a petition to the District Security Command on the 9th, certifying that Wang Yunsheng is a law-abiding merchant.</p>

<p>Kuanlu, the abbot of Lianchi Temple on Wufeng Mountain in the Suzhou countryside, was accused of hiding a woman in a secret room. After investigation by the Public Security Bureau, the county ordered him to be expelled, requiring him to leave the country within one day. However, the monk avoided meeting and refused to hand over the temple, so the authorities could not take over. Kuanlu was secretly working hard to get the authorities to reverse their decision and let him retake control of the temple. Major monasteries and stores in Shanrenqiao Town were interceding for the monk. The county government has approved the dispatch of personnel for a reinvestigation. Section member Wang, together with local Baojia chiefs, conducted an on-site reinvestigation and submitted a report to the county government on the 9th. According to the report, it was found that there was a secret room in the temple's cellar, and a secret loft above the women's toilet, with a small door leading to the back mountain. Women's shoes, hats, and gold bracelets were found. The Lieshu Township District Party Headquarters also submitted a report to the County Party Headquarters and the Second District Administrative Inspector's Office on the 9th, requesting that the authorities maintain their credibility and strictly order the expulsion.</p>

<p>The electricity for the urban area of this county was previously supplied by the Yaoming Electricity Company outside Guangfu. However, it was a commercial enterprise, and was later nationalized by the Qishuyan Electricity Plant of the National Government's Construction Committee. The business developed and expanded to the entire Wujin County. Yuqi and Qianzhou, etc. in the north of this county had poles erected long ago. Zhangjingqiao and Bashiqiao, etc. in the northeast, also had wires strung up and electricity supplied last month, with a total of more than 200 households subscribing. In addition, the Qingyangzhen Puzhao Electricity Company at the intersection of Xicheng signed a contract with the plant to increase its power supply. Furthermore, the Kaiyuan Township Electricity Company in this county previously purchased 150 kilowatts of electricity from the Qi plant. Recently, due to the expansion of its business, the supply was insufficient, and it sent a letter to the plant requesting an additional 50 kilowatts.

<p>The Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau's Inspection Office stated that when earthen cloth from Jiangyin was transported to Shanghai, the Jiangyin Inspection Office did not stamp the transportation permit with a "Checked" stamp, nor did it add an inspection stamp, resulting in repeated detentions by the No. 3 patrol boat. The Earthen Cloth Guild stated that this was hindering sales and sent a letter to the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau requesting that in the future, when Jiangyin earthen cloth is reported for inspection upon import, if the goods match the permit, they should be inspected and released according to regulations. After receiving the letter, the Consolidated Tax Bureau stated that at around 4 p.m. on September 18, the No. 3 patrol boat found a rickshaw puller of unknown name at the Datong Company, holding several factory cloth permits from Jiangyin for pure numbers, applying for registration and stamping. It was claimed that the original goods had already been transshipped, but since there was a permit without goods, registration and stamping could not be done. The rickshaw puller was instructed to report for inspection and stamping first before transshipping in the future. A reply has been sent to the Earthen Cloth Guild that in the future, when transporting cloth from Shanghai, the goods and permits must be reported for inspection at the same time to comply with the regulations.</p>

<p>The Guazhou Township Maritime Provincial Public Security Fourth District Department of the Second District of Jiangdu stated that the defense areas of its various teams are all close to the provincial capital. Maritime security on inland waterways during the winter defense period is particularly important. The Civil Affairs Department has allocated 1,000 new-style guns and punts to the district for cooperative defense. On the 7th, a distribution plan was decided, with two-thirds allocated to the various new waterways subordinate to the Yangtze River, to cooperate with the shallow-water gunboats in patrolling and suppressing bandits, and one-third allocated to the various inland river sub-teams to assist in flood prevention and patrolling. It is heard that each punt has eight shooters. From now on, the strength of both river and inland waterway defenses in the district will be increased, which is a blessing for the area.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Prisoners Petition for Amnesty <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Three hundred and ten prisoners in the Jiangdu County Prison submitted a joint petition to the central government on the 7th, stating in general terms that the Republic of China had experienced successive disasters, and the nation's lifeline was hanging by a thread. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the officials of the government, with their spirit of peace and struggle, were finally able to unify the country and immediately convened the National Assembly to promulgate the constitution. It is also the time of Chairman Chiang's assumption of the premiership, a moment of national celebration. It is believed that times of national celebration must be marked by special acts of grace, and laws must be amended to pardon past offenses. The prisoners have violated criminal laws due to momentary lapses, or due to the constraints of life, or because they were sentenced before the new criminal law came into effect, or because they did not understand the law. They are by no means without extenuating circumstances, and they cannot but regret and repent. Moreover, during this national crisis, it is time for men to serve the country and brave men to die for it. They regret that they have no way to volunteer for service. Therefore, they jointly implore the government to consider their patriotic sincerity, which is the vitality of the nation, and to issue a general amnesty before the convening of the National Assembly to mark the celebration, so that hundreds of thousands of prisoners can share in the special grace, return to the path of self-renewal, take up arms to defend the enemy, and fulfill their desire to serve the country.</p>

Although they wanted to save the village, there was no water to pour on it, and they could not extinguish it, allowing it to burn for four or five hours before it died out on its own. As a result, all the residential houses of more than 20 households in the village were burned down. The disaster victims were crying loudly, a terrible sight to see.</p>

<p>The rivers and lakes are crisscrossed in northern Anhui, and there are many lakes. Farmland relies on irrigation, and agricultural production is abundant. However, in recent years, droughts and floods have occurred frequently, and disasters have followed one after another. The rural economy is in decline, and there is no way to revive the countryside. This spring, the Anhui Provincial Government allocated tens of thousands of yuan to the Anhui Local Bank to experiment with providing loans secured by farmland in the Shouxian area to help farmers, which has been very effective. In order to promote widespread reconstruction, the Provincial Construction Department has ordered the Local Bank to establish bank offices in Fengyang, Huaiyuan, Huoqiu, Fengtai, Yingshang, Guoyang, Zaoyang, and Chuxian to specifically handle loans to farmers in various counties, and to invest in water conservancy projects, dredging rivers and ponds, to regulate finance and increase agricultural production for farmers. The Local Bank, upon receiving the order, is actively planning to implement it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Expanded Anti-Drug Propaganda Campaign Begins in This City Today; People Who Use Drugs Should Quit Immediately; Anyone Caught Starting Next Year Will Be Executed <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command, the Public Security Bureau, and other anti-narcotics agencies in this city have set the central government's two-year deadline for drug prohibition. After this deadline, from January 1, 1937, all drug offenders, according to the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Crimes, will be subject to the death penalty, in addition to those who manufacture, transport, or sell drugs. This includes those who ingest drugs and administer morphine injections. At that time, all drug rehabilitation institutions will stop accepting new addicts, and those arrested will also be subject to the death penalty. The deadline is less than two months away. To seriously warn the people of this city who use drugs to quit as soon as possible in order to save their lives, a meeting was convened and it was decided to hold an expanded anti-drug propaganda campaign from today to the 20th to persuade drug addicts to quit voluntarily within this year to avoid severe punishment. The Public Security Bureau has, in conjunction with the Anti-Opium Committee, printed tens of thousands of propaganda materials, slogans, and pictures for distribution. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau has ordered all its subordinate sub-bureaus and teams to organize propaganda teams and set off to officially promote and persuade people. The Garrison Command has also posted notices to inform the public. The notice of the Garrison Command is recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice of the Garrison Command and the Ministry of Justice</p>
<p>It has been long stipulated by the central government that drug prohibition will last two years and opium smoking prohibition will last six years, and that they will be implemented on schedule. The end of 1936 will be the deadline for drug prohibition. From January 1, 1937, in addition to those who manufacture, transport, or sell drugs, who will still be subject to the death penalty, anyone who ingests red pills, Gaogen, heroin, or other compounds, or various colored pills compounded from them, or administers morphine injections for the first time will also be subject to the death penalty in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Crimes. Now the deadline is approaching and will arrive in a blink of an eye. People from all walks of life should understand the government's determination to prohibit drugs and be aware that the implementation of the ban is not far away. Those who use drugs or administer morphine injections should promptly reflect and quit the habit voluntarily before the end of 1936. If they persist in their errors and delay, the law is strict and they will not be spared. Once they are caught, this Command will severely punish them in accordance with the law, without any leniency. This notice is hereby issued to inform the public.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to the Lower Classes</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has decided to order all sub-bureaus, police stations, and outposts to organize propaganda teams from today to go to factories and ordinary people's homes to distribute propaganda materials, and to give oral propaganda along the way to the general coolies and vagrants. In addition, the Public Security Bureau will print various texts and illustrated posters for posting everywhere to arouse the attention of the general lower classes to the prohibition of opium and to make them understand the pros and cons of being punished by military law if they do not quit opium. In addition, various agencies will prepare various anti-drug films and lantern slides, and consult with the city's cinemas to screen them free of charge for people to visit, and will hold entertainment programs for the general public to visit and promote anti-drug propaganda. Dai Lizhen, chief of the Fourth Section of the Bureau, told a reporter from the Central News Agency that this propaganda campaign will focus on the lower classes because past propaganda campaigns have been effective for the middle and upper classes of citizens, but the lower classes have not paid attention to the textual propaganda and have found it difficult to understand. Therefore, this propaganda campaign will reach into the lower classes. There are many opium smokers among the lower classes in this city, so special attention will be paid to them this time.</p>

<p>After Director Yang's honorable promotion to the Songhu Garrison Commander, the Municipal Security Office was reorganized into the Security Headquarters. The original Party branch of the office was also ordered by the Central Government to be reorganized into the Shanghai Security Forces Party Affairs Steering Committee. Wu Tiecheng, Ji Zhangjian, and Shi Ziya were appointed as steering committee members, with Shi Ziya concurrently serving as secretary-general.

After the ceremony, the oath-takers read the oath, and then</p>

Comrade Wu has made great contributions to the Party and the country. Comrades Ji and Shi have a long and profound history in our Party. Now that the two comrades can use their full strength to preside over Party affairs here, the future achievements will certainly be very considerable. In the past, our Party was able to quickly wipe out the warlords and unify the country, mostly due to the fact that our Party's principles were deeply rooted in the army. Recently, the enemy's oppression of us has been more serious than in any other era. I sincerely hope that all comrades will inherit the legacy of the Premier, work hard to Partyize the army under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and defend the country and the nation. This is the hope that I, representing the Central Government, have for all the comrades who are taking office today," and so on, followed by</p>

<h3 id="e106">Liu Zhongying Suggests  Collecting Vacant House Donations <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Public Concession  Liu Zhongying, a member of the Chinese Ratepayers Association, believes that collecting vacant house donations can reduce rents and prosper the market. Since the French Concession has already implemented it, he specifically suggested to the Ratepayers Association to ask the Public Works Department to follow suit to maintain the market. The original letter from Committee Member Liu is recorded below: Respectfully, regarding the case of the association's suggestion to the Public Works Department to collect vacant house donations, it was passed and executed at the first delegates' meeting of this year. To this day, it has not been implemented. Reading the newspaper, I learned that the French Concession's Municipal Council also believes that the number of vacant houses in the concession is increasing, which affects tax revenue. The Director-General of the Bureau suggested that if there is theft or fire in rented houses with equipment that are not rented, the owners must still ask the police for assistance, and they cannot be exempted from donations. The Board of Directors has resolved that all vacant residential houses will be charged 50% less than ordinary houses, and rented apartments will be charged 75% less. It is also stipulated that this housing tax should be based on the rent paid by the best tenant. I believe that the area of our Public Concession is several times larger than that of the French Concession, and the number of vacant houses in the concession is also greater than that of the French Concession. At this time when the Public Works Department's tax revenue is declining, it seems necessary to increase the collection of vacant house donations. The owners' payment of vacant house donations is their due responsibility. Moreover, by collecting vacant house donations, owners, seeing the increased burden, will inevitably reduce rents and rent out the houses in order to reduce the burden. At a time when everyone believes that rents are expensive and it is difficult to make a living, once rents are reduced, people will rent houses and do business. Therefore, collecting vacant house donations will not only increase tax revenue for the Public Works Department, but also prosper the market. In reality, it is beneficial to the owners and harmless. The above-mentioned measures proposed by the French Concession's Municipal Council are very fair. Our Public Concession authorities should follow suit. Moreover, this case has been resolved and passed by the delegates' meeting. Therefore, I respectfully request that you forward this to the Chinese directors and ask them to suggest that the Public Works Department implement it. This is what I hope for. Addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession.</p>

<p>Pawnshop Letter The Municipal Pawnshop Association, in order to respond to the one-day donation movement, specially convened a general meeting and publicly discussed donations. The funds from the members in the Chinese Concession have been collected, and yesterday, a special letter and donation were sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for collection. The original letter from the association is recorded below: Respectfully, we previously received your association's letter stating that the movement to contribute to the country for one day, initiated by the Libao, should be actively promoted. The business community in the city should make a further determination. Stores should deduct a portion of their one-day business income, and store employees and association office staff should donate all of their one-day salary to the government for the purpose of purchasing aircraft to celebrate birthdays, etc. After this was approved, our association convened a meeting of colleagues on October 27 and resolved that each pawnshop should choose one of the three amounts, eight yuan, nine yuan, and ten yuan, as a one-day business deduction and employee salary income, and submit it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for transfer to the government to purchase aircraft to celebrate birthdays. In addition to recording it in the file, all colleagues who attended the meeting immediately agreed to recognize ten yuan each. The association's staff also participated in the recognition. The financial officer, Si Niandian, has collected the funds separately, totaling 420 yuan from the 42 pawnshops belonging to the association, two yuan from the association's document clerk Yu Jun, and 150 yuan from the new colleagues in the concession. The three items total 572 yuan in national currency. We have prepared a letter and sent it along with the funds to your association. We hope that your association will check and transfer it to the government to express our patriotic sincerity.</p>

The Japanese Cotton Mill Association convened a meeting of managers from various mills at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss solutions. Labor unrest is also brewing in factories such as Neiwaimian in West Shanghai. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Five Conditions  Workers from Japanese cotton mills such as Neiwaimian, Toyota, Gongda, Xihe, Shanghai, Dakang, Tongxing, Yufeng, Rihua, and Donghua in Shanghai East, Shanghai West, and Pu East issued a joint declaration and put forward five conditions as follows: (1) A wage increase of 20%; (2) One hour of rest after meals; (3) No dismissal of any worker; (4) No torture of any worker; (5) Opposition to working extra hours on Sundays.</p>
<p>Joint Strike  After the workers from each factory put forward the five conditions, all the male and female workers from seven Japanese cotton mills, including Shanghai Factories No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, Tongxing Factory No. 2, and Donghua at 1687 Huade Road, Yangshupu, Shanghai East, launched a strike at 11:30 p.m. on the 8th. All the male and female workers were scattered on the roads near the factory during the day to inquire about news, and they still returned to their workshops at night. The order was quite good. According to the results of the investigation, there are more than 11,500 striking workers in Shanghai Factories No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 1,670 in Tongxing, and 20 in Donghua, totaling more than 15,000 people.</p>
<p>Negotiations Ineffective  Japanese Shanghai Cotton Mill, etc., notified the foremen to enter the factory for consultation with the factory at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The chief foreman, Litian, personally reported to the workers and admitted to increasing wages by 5%, but the workers believed that the difference between the proposed 20% general wage increase was too great and could not represent all the workers. The negotiations were ineffective. The factory then posted a notice at around 11:00 a.m. stating, "For the sake of notification, the factory has approved a general wage increase of 5% for the workers' request for a wage increase. We hope that all workers will resume work immediately, otherwise they will be expelled from the factory." At about 8:00 p.m., a reporter from Dagongshe learned the latest news that the workers had changed the first condition of a 20% general wage increase to 10%. In addition to one hour of rest after meals for the second item, it must be stipulated that there will be a half-hour rest from 9:00 a.m. to 9:15 a.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. every day. For the fifth item, if there are extra working hours on Sundays, two days of bonus work must be given each month.</p>
<p>Association Discusses  Chuanjin, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Mill Association, visited Heitian, manager of Shanghai Cotton Mill, Shitian, manager of Donghua Cotton Mill, and Tachikawa, manager of Tongxing Cotton Mill (because Tachikawa returned to Japan, he was replaced by Daishi, director of the personnel department) at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to investigate the workers' strike and the conditions proposed by the workers. He then left. At 4:00 p.m., he convened a joint meeting of the heads of Japanese cotton mills such as Shanghai at the Japanese Club on Penglu Road to discuss solutions. After discussion, because the wage issue is related to all Japanese cotton mills, it is necessary to convene cotton mills that have not gone on strike to discuss together before a solution can be found. Tongxing Cotton Mill telegraphed Tachikawa, the manager who had returned to Japan, to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>Each Factory on Alert  After the strike of cotton mills such as Shanghai Tongxing Donghua, the Yulin Road Police Station and the Grant Road Police Station in the Public Concession sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to suppress the strike. Japanese Marines were stationed in various factories under strict alert, and police cars patrolled back and forth. The Gongda Dakang and other cotton mills adjacent to Shanghai and other factories were deeply afraid of labor unrest, so the alert was very strict.</p>
<p>Each Factory Brewing  Workers from cotton mills such as Neiwaimian, Toyota, Xihe, Tongxing Factory No. 1 in West Shanghai, Rihua in Pudong, Shanghai East, Dakang, Gongda, and Yufeng joined with the workers from Shanghai Tongxing Factory No. 2 and Donghua in Shanghai East to issue a declaration and put forward conditions. They originally planned to take the same steps to proceed. After the factory learned the news in advance, they were closely monitored, so it was not realized. The workers in each factory are still secretly active and brewing. If the labor unrest in Shanghai, Tongxing, Donghua, and other factories is not resolved soon, they will inevitably come to help. When the workers of the Japanese cotton mills were on strike, the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road posted a notice at the factory gate at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to recruit new workers. More than 200 male and female workers from Japanese factories have applied.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Soar  After the news of the joint strike of workers in Japanese cotton mills spread to the market, yarn prices suddenly rose sharply. The opening and closing prices of yarn for the near and distant future yesterday are as follows: November opening 232.5 yuan, closing 231 yuan, December opening 223.1 yuan, closing 223.2 yuan, January 26th year 218.7 yuan, closing 218.3 yuan, February opening 216.4 yuan, closing 217 yuan, March opening 216.4 yuan, closing 217 yuan. If the labor unrest is prolonged and the current yarn is scarce, yarn prices will inevitably continue to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Merchant Ship Accident <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Chunhe, a vessel rented by the Dalu Industrial Company from the Tonghe Shipping Company, has a load of 1,765 tons and a draft of 17 feet 4 inches. The vessel was transporting salt in Haizhou and, within the past week, ran aground at Chenjiagang Port due to receding water after being heavily loaded. After just managing to free it, another telegram was received yesterday from its shipowner, stating that on the night of the 7th of this month, when sailing out of Chenjiagang, it encountered severe gales and rainstorms with very large waves, making navigation difficult. The ship dropped anchor to avoid damage. However, the wind and waves were too strong, causing the port anchor chain to break, and one iron anchor was lost at sea. Sixty-six feet of anchor chain were also broken and lost at sea, causing significant damage. Fortunately, the hull remains safe.</p>
<p>Huachang Runs Aground for the Second Time</p>
<p>The Huachang vessel of the Yicheng Shipping Company is now determined to be carrying coal to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The vessel has a draft of 19 feet 4 inches. Therefore, it ran aground near Wuhu last week. After being rescued and continuing upstream, the water level of the Yangtze River has been very shallow recently, and the recession is particularly fast, causing the Huachang vessel to run aground for the second time when it reached the river surface of Huangshigang. It is now unloading cargo for salvage. According to someone from the company yesterday, it is hoped that the unloading and salvage can be completed today. It was also reported that the Tongli vessel of the Tongcheng Company lost a port anchor on the Wuhu river surface, according to a telegram from the shipowner yesterday. Details were not given and a telegram has been sent to inquire.</p>
<p>Japanese Tugboat Collides with Yushun</p>
<p>The Taipingmaru vessel of the Dalian Steamship Company, towing tugboat No. 145, entered Tianjin Port. While heading towards the China Merchants Bureau wharf, the Yushun vessel of the China Merchants Bureau turned around and sailed out. Yushun honked its horn to order it to slow down, but the vessel failed to stop in time, causing the tugboat to collide with the No. 4 cargo hold door of Yushun, causing damage. Fortunately, Chief Engineers Cao and Zhu were in Tianjin and immediately went to inspect and negotiate with the Japanese vessel. The Japanese merchants acknowledged full responsibility for compensation and repair.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Japanese Residents Show Sympathy for the City Federation's Advice, Write a Letter to Arrange a Meeting <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News reported that the Shanghai First Special Zone Citizens' Federation, after its seventh standing committee meeting resolved to publish a letter advising Japanese residents in Shanghai to stabilize the market, Japanese merchants in Shanghai attached great importance to this. The honorary chairman of the Japanese Federation, Lin Xiongji, and the committee chairman, Kondo Hikaru, sent a letter to the City Federation a few days ago, expressing their willingness to arrange a date and place to exchange views, enhance friendship, and save the market. It is understood that the City Federation has also replied by letter yesterday, expressing the same wish. However, it is necessary to meet and discuss the matter. The correspondence between the two parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from Japanese Residents The Japanese Federations of various roads in this city sent a letter to the First Special Zone City Federation on October 31, saying, "Respectfully, on reading the newspaper on October 29, we learned that the seventh advice of your council's resolutions was directed at the Japanese residents in Shanghai, asking them to promote friendship. The members of our association heard of it and were deeply touched and sympathetic. Establishing friendship is also what our association wants. We dare to ask you to arrange a date and place to exchange views. We pray for your instructions on which day we can receive your advice. Lin Xiongji, Honorary Chairman, and Kondo Hikaru, Committee Chairman, of the Japanese Federations of various roads in Shanghai, October 31, 11th year of Showa."</p>

<h3 id="e118">Zhejiang Provincial Government Approved Rice Transport to Shanghai, Jiangsu Province Did Not Obstruct, Grain in this City Not Panic <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Since Zhejiang and Anhui provinces banned the export of rice, and Jiangsu Province promulgated measures to prohibit the export of grain, grain merchants in this city were deeply afraid that the people's livelihood in this city would panic as a result. After appealing to all parties, it is understood that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has now approved the transport of rice to Shanghai. However, in terms of procedures, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should prepare a certificate for release. The relevant procedures have now been negotiated and completed by Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Miscellaneous Grain Association, and Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and have been handled accordingly. Therefore, Zhejiang rice and grain have been coming in steadily. As for Jiangsu Province, there has been no obstruction so far. Therefore, there is no need to panic about grain and rice in this city, and the price has also eased due to the large number of arrivals. Regarding the issue of grain control, in order to achieve unity, the central government will discuss unified measures by the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Internal Affairs. According to news obtained by grain merchants in this city, a special grain management bureau will be established by the central government to be in charge of all matters such as grain purchase, warehousing, and transportation. It is expected to be realized soon.</p>
<p>According to Xinxin News, it was learned from the Miscellaneous Grain Industry that the sources of supply from various gangs have recently released rice from Zhejiang, and merchants are allowed to transport it freely to Shanghai after signing a pledge. As a result, the arrivals have suddenly increased. There were a total of 100 warehouses arriving the other day, accounting for more than 20,000 stones, and the people's hearts have settled. The market sales are sluggish, and the Jinqingyan and other gangs are not handling much goods, resulting in a situation of oversupply. Market prices have generally fallen, and if the source continues to surge, there will be a continued downward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Chamber of Commerce Submits Urgent Request: Joint and Several Liability of Partnerships <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted another urgent request to the Legislative Yuan regarding the issue of joint and several liability of partnerships. The original petition stated, "Regarding the matter of submitting a request, concerning the amendment of the regulations on joint and several liability for partnership debts, your esteemed Yuan had adopted the opinions of the national business community and separately drafted a Commercial Registration Law to remedy the situation. However, because the draft was submitted in October of the 23rd year and opinions could not be unified, it has been stalled to this day and has not become a separate law for reference. Consequently, the requests of the national business community have not been fulfilled, and there is no hope of a satisfactory resolution to partnership debt disputes. From March of the 22nd year to June of this year, the affiliated chambers of commerce have sent telegrams urging a resolution three times and submitted petitions urging a resolution once. In July of this year, chambers of commerce from various provinces, cities, and counties attending a meeting in Shanghai also jointly submitted a petition urging a resolution. However, the draft has still not been opened for discussion and passed by your esteemed Yuan. The national business community believes that passing laws is the special prerogative of your esteemed Yuan. Part of the Commercial Registration Law pertains to matters already stipulated in the existing, still-valid General Rules for Merchants. Your esteemed Yuan has the authority to weigh whether there is a need to formulate a separate law. However, the origin of drafting a separate registration law stems from the issue of partnership liability. Therefore, the point regarding appropriately regulating this matter aligns your esteemed Yuan's view with business realities. Laws are the crystallization of public opinion, and merchants have been eagerly awaiting them for a long time. If there is no need to separately draft a Commercial Registration Law for the time being, then a remedy should urgently be devised regarding the joint and several liability of partnership debts to avoid being trapped in this difficult situation for a long time. It is appropriate to prepare a document and respectfully request your esteemed Yuan to review and approve it as appropriate for the public good."</p>

<p>According to a warning issued yesterday by the Customs Conservancy Department, navigation on the Yangtze River between Shanghai and Hankou requires detours due to the drying up and blockage of the Tuanfeng and Yadan Islets waterways in the Hankou section. The matter is important. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Waterway Dries Up: The shrinkage of the Yangtze River's water volume has not ceased. Although navigation between Shanghai and Hankou has been reduced in tonnage, obstacles continue to arise. According to a warning issued yesterday by the Customs Conservancy Department of this port, the Tuanfeng and Yadan Islets waterways in the Hankou section (both above Jiujiang) have dried up and become blocked. Therefore, all Yangtze River vessels traveling from Shanghai to Hankou or from Hankou to Shanghai must detour via Luohu Islet to the west and are only allowed to pass during daytime, with nighttime navigation prohibited.</p>
<p>Establishing Signals: The Customs has also established the following temporary signal methods for the Yangtze River's lower reaches due to the current shrinkage causing blockages. The following items have been approved by various ports along the Yangtze River's lower reaches and are to be widely known: Waterway Obstruction Signal universally used throughout the Yangtze River's lower reaches. If a waterway is narrow and difficult to navigate or blocked and impassable, hindering navigation safety, the original signal on the warning vessel marker at either end of the waterway will be removed and replaced with the following signals: (1) Daytime: Three black balls arranged vertically. (2) Nighttime: Three red lights arranged vertically.</p>

<p>The former Baohua Silk Weaving Factory, due to the unwarranted dismissal of a large number of workers and the factory director of Yucu Village severely beating a worker causing injury, led to successive strikes at six silk factories, including Fuxing and Tiancheng. After party and government organs sent personnel to persuade them, work was resumed one after another, and the disputes were mediated according to law. However, during the mediation period on the 5th of this month, the factory's attitude suddenly changed, leading to a failure to resolve the issues. Therefore, the workers threatened another strike, warning the capitalists. Unexpectedly, the factory, seeing that the workers were not showing much, thought they could be deceived. Yucu Village immediately dismissed Qian Zhangfei and others on the day of the decision, and Yiyou Factory also dismissed Zhou Genyuan and others, which further aroused public outrage. They strongly argued with the factory and submitted conditions again through legal procedures, limiting the factory to reinstate all illegally dismissed workers within two days. More than a hundred representatives were sent yesterday morning to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the General Labor Union. The remaining workers continued to work as usual, but according to the decided time, all workers went on strike for one hour to show their strength, it is said.</p>

<p>Accurately fill out to facilitate circulation and avoid difficulties. Application form and supporting documents have been printed. After the Shanghai Grains, Oilcakes, and Allied Trades Association petitioned for the revocation of the orders from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces prohibiting the export of grain, Chairman Gu Xin'yi and Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce agreed on a method to be clarified by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Now, the application form and certificate have been printed and will be implemented after printing is completed. The notice to members from the association is recorded as follows: This time, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have banned the export of rice and grain, which is related to the food supply of this city. This association has already sent letters to the local associations and the municipal government, separately requesting the authorities of the two provinces to lift the ban. Subsequently, Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government replied by telegram, stating that Zhejiang's ban on exports was to prevent smuggling, and that if Shanghai has a formal certificate from the Chamber of Commerce, it can be transported to aid the city, etc. The local association has copied the document and sent it to the association. After consulting with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the certification procedures have been determined. In the future, if fellow traders purchase rice and grain from Zhejiang, they must submit a letter from this association to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to apply for the issuance of a certificate and carry it for verification. In addition to having already sent a letter to the local association to reply to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, notifying all counties under its jurisdiction, it is appropriate to prepare an application form for application. If fellow traders want to purchase and transport rice and grain from Zhejiang Province, they can prepare a letter to this association to collect the required application form, fill it out accurately, and report it to this association for verification and stamping. Take it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to apply for the issuance of a certificate to be carried for purchase and transportation to facilitate circulation and avoid difficulties. This is hereby notified, November 8, Republic of China, Year 25.</p>

<p>Minister of Railways Zhang Jia'ao came to Shanghai from Beijing on official business. He went to Xiafei Road at 10:00 yesterday morning to mourn the death of Duan Qirui. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency met him at the residence and asked about the Hong Kong telegram regarding the connection of the Guangzhou-Hankou and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways and the plan prepared by the Ministry of Railways, as well as the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway train crash case. According to him, the issue of connecting the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has been repeatedly rumored externally and is purely unfounded speculation and not credible. The Ministry of Railways has not yet planned this matter. As for the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway train crash case, the Ministry of Railways has dispatched Director Sa Fujun and others to investigate. However, the project was completed ahead of schedule, and most of the necessary traffic facilities have not been installed. In addition, due to military transport, traffic order is inevitably disrupted, resulting in repeated train crashes. The responsibility for the negligence cannot be determined. Only urge the authorities of the road to quickly install the necessary equipment to maintain road administration. Passenger trains between Guangzhou and Hankou run twice a week in each direction, and local passenger trains on each section run daily, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Important News from the Chinese Ancient Coin Society <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ancient Coin Society held its ninth research meeting yesterday, attended by more than 20 members including Zhang Shuxun, Yi Yugong, Cheng Wuquan, Yang Kailing, Hu Puan, Zhang Jiliang, Wu Jing'an, and Chen Ruzhai. The research topic was Song Huizong Coins. All agreed that the coins personally inscribed by Huizong were second to none in ancient and modern times. The skill of minting coins was no less than that of Xin Mang. His slender gold calligraphy style was spiritually exquisite. Huizong lived in a time of foreign invasion. Although he was not good at governing the country, he was good at making coins. He was not good at controlling the size of the coins, but he was good at controlling their inscriptions and making them aesthetically pleasing. When Cai Jing was Prime Minister, he minted Chongning coins that were cheap and overvalued. Poor people had difficulty eating, and the Grand View period still followed the same path. More than 100,000 people were accused of using politics to make money, so minting coins for the world should be carefully examined. In addition, the society's journal, Ancient Coins, issue number three, has been collected and arranged and will be published on the first of next month. It is reported that the main items include Weng Yiquan's unpublished manuscripts, as well as major works by Zhang Jiongbo, Zhang Shuxun, Zheng Jiaxiang, Cheng Wuquan, Ding Fubao, Yang Kailing, and others.</p>

<p>The new building of Lao Jie Fu Silk and Satin Store on Nanjing Road celebrated its completion and opened yesterday with reduced prices. The cheap prices broke all records, and the new and complete range of colors and patterns made it the best in Shanghai. In addition to preparing Xin Ya refreshments to share with customers, they also sprayed Xin Sanxing perfume, which was very unique, and the gifts were not enough to keep up. Therefore, gift certificates were issued, which were beautifully printed and brightly colored, which can generally be seen the value of the gifts. The perfection of the equipment and the accuracy of the light are especially redundant. Therefore, although customers were crowded all day from morning to night, they still got what they needed and returned home with laughter. At this time when the market is sluggish and all industries are contracting, the store is trying its best to expand, which shows its strong strength and outstanding reputation. The white-year order name can be permanently maintained, and this is recorded to celebrate the domestic silk industry.</p>

<p>Bao Liwei and others, Russians who specialize in insuring cheap goods for huge fire insurance amounts, then storing them in foreign warehouses, and taking the opportunity to set fires in an attempt to obtain insurance compensation, again sent their fox tails, worth only more than 400 yuan, to Louis Moore Auction House on the 24th of last month. Accomplices posed as buyers and went to bid at the auction, deliberately raising the price to 6,000 yuan. After purchasing, they insured the five wooden boxes of fox tails for fire insurance of 6,000 yuan with the French-American Insurance Company and transported them to Longmao Foreign Warehouse, 77 Sichuan Road, for storage, thinking that after a period of time, the</p>
<p>Arson Pieces</p>
<p>Installed in the box would automatically explode, causing a fire, and they could sit back and reap the benefits. Unexpectedly, this plan was known to the patrol room in advance, so when Bao Liwei and Ke Nele were transporting the boxes into the warehouse, they were intercepted on the spot by Detective Chief Feng Zhiming, Liu Shaokui, Detective She Fu Tang, and others, and then five more accomplices were arrested and sent to the First Special District District Court. The facts of the case were recorded in this newspaper. Now, according to the detailed investigation by the handling detectives, the result is that one of them, Ma Jinggao Weisigan,</p>

<p>Of endangering public safety and fraud, because the defendants' behavior was dangerous as a method and aimed at fraud. In front of the court, the judge ordered Ma Jinggao Weisigan to be released. Then, Lawyer Ru stated the relationship of the six defendants to the case, saying that the first and second defendants transported the wooden boxes to the Samoa warehouse on the 24th of last month. In the residences of these two people, they found the bill issued by Louis Moore for the auction of leather goods, the warehouse list issued by Longmao, and the machine parts for arson. The explosive power of this machine was</p>
<p>Examined by Experts</p>
<p>And a report was made. The expert can also come to court to testify. As for the third and fourth defendants, they jointly manufactured the arson machine. In the home of the fifth defendant, leather goods and remaining machine parts were also hidden. The sixth defendant was one of the people who went to the auction house to bid when the leather goods were auctioned. The price of 6,000 yuan was also set by him. Now, the first, second, and third defendants have all confessed to</p>
<p>Intending to Set Fire</p>
<p>However, the remaining three defendants are still cunning. Various documents seized and the arson machine that was partially dismantled by the patrol room were presented to the court. After viewing the evidence, it was decided to have the handling detective report the process of solving the case. Then, Wu Zimei and other employees of Longmao Warehouse testified that the Russians had sent wooden boxes to the warehouse for storage in succession since May 18 of this year, totaling five times. Then, Judge Qian interrogated the defendants one by one and ordered them to await a renewed trial at a later date.</p>

<p>The case of American national Gillis Martin beating to death rickshaw puller Sun Weiyu near Yu’s residence in the new western district of the Southern City on the morning of the 4th of this month: the perpetrator Martin has already been handed over by the Public Security Bureau to the American Consulate and detained in the Western Jail of the Public Works Department on Ward Road. The deceased's body was also inspected by the local court, which determined that he died by falling into the riverbank and drowning after being injured. An autopsy report was attached to the case file.  The prosecutor in charge of examining the case, Kong Xianglin, believes that the case file should be compiled and submitted to the city government for handling negotiations. Therefore, yesterday he summoned witnesses Xue Zhengfu, Jiang Yu, and the deceased's brothers Sun Weifang and Sun Weiyu to the case to hear their testimonies and the plaintiffs' claims. Written records were taken to be attached to the case file for transfer to the city government for handling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the case of American national Martin beating rickshaw puller Sun Weiyu to death, the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai attaches great importance to it and has telegraphed the details to the U.S. government. A new judge, Watson (transliteration), has been specially appointed to come to China to be responsible for the trial of this case. Mr. Watson is currently awaiting a ship in San Francisco. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the City Public Security Bureau specially dispatched Inspector Zhao Bojun, accompanied by a Western officer from the Central Police Station, to the American Consulate to meet with Prosecutor Trumbull of the Assessor's Office and Judge Hamke to inquire about the date of the trial, so as to be prepared for negotiations at that time. They also inquired about Martin's degree of intoxication after the rickshaw ride and the details of the assault. Mr. Hamke responsibly stated that if the U.S. government considers Martin guilty, he will be tried according to American law, without partiality or leniency. However, since the new judge Watson cannot arrive for the time being, a well-reputed American expatriate in Shanghai who is familiar with the law and the situation in Shanghai will be selected to be primarily responsible for handling the case first.</p>

<p>Recently, Taiwanese individuals organized a currency counterfeiting operation in Shanghai, specializing in the production of fake 20-dollar banknotes from a certain American bank for circulation in the United States. After the U.S. government discovered this, they notified the Japanese government for strict investigation. The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai arrested several Taiwanese suspects. After investigation, it was learned that the leader was Zhou Qizhong from Taiwan, hiding at No. 439 Pope Road in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Beijing Apartments,</p>
<p>Room 12. The Japanese Consulate then notified the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, who dispatched Western Detective Pratt, Japanese Detective Kobayashi, and Chinese Detective Zhu Shulin, who requested the French police to send additional detectives for assistance. Although Zhou's wife, Zhu Huiying, was arrested in Apartment 12, the investigation revealed that she was not involved in her husband's conspiracy.</p>
<p>Previously released after translation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives continued to investigate near the Beijing Apartments every day, hoping to find Zhou Qizhong's whereabouts, but to no avail. At 3:30 PM on the 7th, Zhang Zifu, a 35-year-old from Tianjin, suddenly entered Room 12 of the Beijing Apartments alone and began removing items from the room. The detectives suspected that he must be related to the owner of the apartment.</p>
<p>He was immediately arrested</p>
<p>and taken back to the police station for strict interrogation. According to Zhang, he was a servant at the Guo residence at No. 582 Rue de la Lousinne. His mistress is the daughter of Xu Shiying, the current ambassador to Japan, and Zhu Huiying is a close friend of the mistress. The mistress sent him to the apartment to move items because Zhu is facing litigation, etc. Based on Zhang's confession, the detectives went to the Guo residence to investigate with Mr. and Mrs. Guo Xu. Mrs. Xu admitted</p>
<p>that Zhang was employed,</p>
<p>but firmly denied all the other details of Zhang's confession. The police believed that Mrs. Guo Xu's statement was credible. Therefore, this morning, Zhang was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Qian presided over the interrogation. The police lawyer Ru Bao Yi explained the case and requested that Zhang be detained for further detailed investigation. After a brief interrogation, the court ordered that Zhang be detained for one week for investigation and trial.</p>

<p>Chief Detective of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Rice Ziqing, Zhang Xiaolin, and Western Detective Luo Si previously learned that someone was privately counterfeiting small champagne tickets for the race meeting to be held at the Race Club on the 10th of this month and selling them in the city. They began to investigate and confirmed the information. On the 1st of this month, they arrested the suspects (1) Feng Qishan, (2) Xu Weibing, (4) Qiu Xianfu, (4) Zhang Xianggui, (5) Yin Yangchun, (6) Chen Sentang, (7) Zhao Bingsheng, and (8) Yu Luruo, and confiscated the counterfeit champagne tickets</p>
<p>more than three thousand sheets</p>
<p>from the Tongchun Printing Shop at No. 7 Cuijia Lane, Fumin Road in the Southern City.</p>
<p>Another fifty fake tickets each were found on the first and second defendant. They were sent to the First Special Court with a request for detention. The circumstances were previously reported in this newspaper. This morning, Judge Qian Hongye continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi prosecuted the defendants under Article 210 of the Criminal Law, which punishes forgery. Defendants Zhao Bingsheng and Yu Luruo hired lawyers Yu Enliang and Wu Peng to defend them. Lawyer Ru then presented the investigation of the case, saying</p>
<p>the most important aspect</p>
<p>pertained to the sixth defendant, Chen Sentang. Chen and Xie Rongqing, who is at large, were previously colleagues on a ship that traveled between Hankou and Shanghai. On the 19th of last month, Xie conceived the idea of counterfeiting champagne tickets from the race club and entrusted Chen to handle it, totaling four thousand tickets, for which he was willing to pay four yuan per hundred tickets. The next day, the 20th, Xie and Chen met at the Yilinchun Tea House on Jiujiang Road. Xie handed over genuine champagne tickets, from No. 1936 to No. 1932,</p>
<p>and asked Chen to print them</p>
<p>in the same way. After they were printed, they were to be sent to Yongyu Trading Company, No. 55 Daijia Port, Hankou. They then parted ways. Chen then went to the Weisheng Engraving Shop at No. 4 Lane, Rue Belleville in the French Concession and entrusted the seventh and eighth defendants to make zinc plates. The seventh defendant was the accountant of the engraving shop, and the eighth defendant was the owner of the shop. They made three zinc plates, costing five yuan. After Chen obtained the zinc plates, he went to Gongyu Paper Shop on Tiantong Road on October 26th and</p>
<p>paid five yuan</p>
<p>for two hundred sheets of paper. He then went to the Tongchun Printing Shop at No. 7 Cuijia Lane, Fumin Road in the Southern City, opened by Chuan Tongchun, and negotiated printing procedures. It was agreed that the printing fee would be four yuan per thousand sheets for four thousand sheets. Chuan ordered the workers, the fourth and fifth defendants, to do the printing. After the printing was completed, Chen Sentang found that there were still shortcomings. He then entrusted the seventh and eighth defendants of the engraving shop to counterfeit the Race Club's seal and stamp it on the tickets.</p>
<p>The matter was completed.</p>
<p>Chen entrusted the third defendant, Qiu Xianfu, to sell the tickets in Nantung and other places outside of the city, for five yuan per hundred tickets. In Shanghai, he entrusted the second defendant, Xu Weibing, to sell them for seven yuan per hundred tickets. Xu then entrusted the first defendant, Feng Qishan, to sell fifty tickets for nine yuan. Therefore, when the first and second defendants were arrested, ninety tickets each were found on them. He then submitted the confiscated items to the court for investigation. When questioned, most of the defendants admitted to the charges. After mutual arguments by the two lawyers, the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and await sentencing on the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association sent telegrams to the Third District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, the Coastal Patrol Department of the Navy, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Songhu Garrison Command regarding the robbery of the Baohua ship: "According to a report from our member, the Ping An Shipping Company, our company's Baohua ship departed from Pier No. 8 in the Southern City at 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month. At 7:00 PM, outside of Wusongkou, more than a dozen robbers speaking a strong northern accent suddenly opened fire. They first went to the escort police room and confiscated the guns, then opened fire in the accounting room, robbing more than 400 yuan of ticket sales and money entrusted by customers. They then moved the upper-class passengers, along with the tea room staff, down to the lower class and drove everyone to the front lower class, where they began to search and rob all the money and neatly arranged clothing they had on them. Around 11:00 PM, a sailboat came alongside and took the 16 pirates away. The location of the incident was near Liangsha and Ougang Port in Chongming. It was discovered that one passenger was shot and wounded by the pirates, and a package of cargo and a cylinder head from the engine room were taken away, rendering the ship unable to operate. They immediately dropped anchor and waited until 6:00 AM the next morning before sailing back to Shanghai, arriving at Pier No. 8 in the Southern City at 11:30 AM on the morning of the 7th. We urgently reported to the affiliated association to forward the report to the military and police agencies, requesting strict investigation, recovery of the stolen goods, and punishment. We are now reporting the situation and earnestly request that you promptly conduct a strict investigation, bring the perpetrators to justice, eradicate banditry, and protect merchants. We are deeply grateful. The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association respectfully states."</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I recently read the Shanghai news columns in the Shen Bao, Xin Bao, Min Bao, and Da Gong Bao of the 9th of this month, which reported that the Shanghai Recreation Association opposed the Telegraph Bureau's restriction on the broadcasting time of ten programs. The facts are quite different and are completely one-sided, which seems to have other purposes. Our bureau was ordered to restrict the broadcasting time of these recreation programs because the lyrics of these programs are obscene and absurd, which hinders social development. Therefore, we first imposed passive restrictions to clear the airwaves. We are now actively working to enrich the content to promote social education and improve the effectiveness of broadcasting. We have always admired your newspaper's efforts in cultural construction, detailed analysis, and fair criticism. Therefore, we are sending this letter to the editor, and we ask that you publish this letter so that we can make improvements.</p>

<h3 id="e168">General Situation of Industrial and Commercial Changes in Shanghai in July and August of This Year, Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce (37) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by China</p>
<p>In July of this year, Shanghai's industry and commerce slightly improved after the summer festival and the half-year settlement period. However, the exhausted and sluggish phenomenon continued to exist. In the financial industry, the opposition between commercial banks and state-owned banks became increasingly acute. A portion of the commercial banks with weaker foundations mostly adopted a defensive stance, contracting and gradually stagnating. Therefore, the phenomenon of capital concentration became more and more obvious. In the industrial sector, the decline followed a straight line, with little sign of improvement. As for the sales business and consumer business, which are at the heart of the market, although the number of new creations was considerable, the number of bankruptcies doubled. Moreover, there were many cases of reorganization or liquidation within three or four months of operation. This is because the purchasing power of the market has not increased, and the turnover of finance is still stagnant. In August of this year, Shanghai's industry and commerce remained relatively stable in the general downward trend. Although the number of new creations decreased, the decrease in the number of closures was even greater. Therefore, relatively speaking, it can be regarded as a turning point. The reasons for this are probably two: one is that the changes in sales firms in this month were relatively moderate, and the other is that the manufacturing industry has shown a trend of prosperity. The only difference is that the chaotic state under the category of special undertakings has become more serious than before. Now, the statistics of various changes in July and August will be compared with the previous two months (ie, May and June) and the corresponding period last year, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>The distribution of the various changes in July and August of this year listed in the previous table among the various industries is as follows:</p>

<p>In the Intermediate Cup of the Chunghwa Football Association, eight teams competed. The preliminary matches were held at the Great Chunghwa Stadium the day before yesterday. All teams arrived in order and competed. Except for the tie between Shuangqian and Shunjing, which still needs to be replayed to determine the winner, the Taikoo team gave up on their own after playing the first half, allowing Jinde to win with half the effort. As a result, Puxing, Huanan, and Jinde won and advanced to the second round next week. In the match, Fudan relied on their average talent to defeat Jinde A 3-1, but some of Fudan's players acted rudely, which nearly led to a disagreement, which was a pity. The Public Security team was defeated by Huafeng. The results of each team are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Division Result</p>
<p>Jinde wins Taikoo Intermediate Cup Taikoo forfeits</p>

It is expected that the competition will begin in late October. (Also, Mr. Deng Jinkun of the Jingxiang team is requested to go to the stadium once today to complete the procedures.)</p>

<p>To Indicate the True Meaning of Promoting Sports, To Break the General Misconceptions</p>
<p>The Municipal Physical Education School of this city invited Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau to give a speech at the memorial week held at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The general idea was that physical education is education, and education cannot be divided. It not only cultivates knowledge, but also exercises the body. The general public thinks that physical education is what people in physical education schools pursue, and people in physical education schools also think that they are specialized in physical education and that there is no need to study other knowledge. Therefore, the meaning of education is divided, which is a very big mistake. Moreover, the general schools treat athletes differently, even giving them rich food and clothing, and the homework is more relaxed. Raising some athletes to win championships when the school starts the sports meet is tantamount to treating athletes as toys and tools, which is also a very big mistake. Therefore, we must break this misconception. We not only seek physical health, but also psychological health. Although we study physical education, we also attach importance to knowledge, because the meaning of education is to make a person whole and upward, not just to complete the training of the body. Especially the students of our Municipal Physical Education School should recognize this meaning to correct the mistakes of the general public.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that people who generally exercise are very interested in chess, City No. 1 Stadium has specially organized the first chess competition to fulfill the wishes of the public. Registration is scheduled to begin yesterday and will close on the 23rd of this month. The competition time is from 7:00 p.m. every day, which does not hinder the exercise of professional and practicing sports from all walks of life. The method is to take the complex cycle system. Depending on the number of participants, the lottery will be divided into several groups, each with a single cycle competition. One person with the best score will be recorded and combined into one group, and then a single cycle competition will be held. The three people with the best scores will be the winners of the first, second, and third places in the Class A category. The one person with the best scores among the first place and below in the group cycle competition will be drawn again to form a group and hold a single cycle competition. The three people with the best scores will be the first, second, and third place winners in the Class B category. During the competition, the spirit of the New Life Movement will be used to eliminate the bad habits of the old game of arching, such as smoking cigarettes and untidy clothes, which are not allowed to enter the room for competition. Those who have a lack of humility in their words and attitudes will also be subject to considerable penalties, and attention will also be paid to observing the time and obeying the judgment.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Comparison of Tuition Fees for Private Schools in Various Provinces and Cities for Improvement <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The following is a summary of the tuition fees charged by private schools across the country throughout the year, and whether they have been improved, based on the results of the Ministry of Education's survey in the 24th year of the Republic of China. (Explanation) Improvement refers to the use of school textbooks. Non-improvement refers to the non-use of textbooks. With the exception of Xinjiang and Weihaiwei, where there are no private schools, and Hunan and Xikang, where the number of private schools has not been reported (many private schools in Hunan have been improved separately), of the 1,558,000 private schools that have been reported, those that have been improved account for slightly less than 47%, and those that have not been improved account for slightly more than 52%. This is the situation in the 24th year of the Republic of China. Since the implementation of compulsory education and the training of private school teachers in various provinces, the number of private schools that have been improved since the 25th year of the Republic of China should have increased compared to before.</p>

<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>Our country has complete libraries, but not many. The National Peking Library can be considered our country's only complete library. The National Central Library, which is being planned, is also roughly taking shape and is now open for reading. Furthermore, a site for the library has been decided, and construction of a grand-scale library will begin soon. The Oriental Library, run by the Commercial Press, is very rich in content and has many treasures, but unfortunately, it was destroyed in the January 28th Incident. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there are a total of 1,634 libraries in the country, including 48 provincial and municipal libraries, 1,260 county and municipal libraries, and 363 private libraries. Radio education, through wireless broadcasting, allows countless people, near and far, to listen. It transmits news very quickly and is very useful for implementing social education. If every village and city in our country could be universally equipped with radios, and educational institutions could broadcast at fixed times on radio stations, it would be very effective for imparting knowledge, disseminating government information, or broadcasting music and drama to satisfy the public's spiritual needs. Once a foreign war breaks out, it can also serve as a powerful tool for transmitting news and unifying the people's will. The Ministry of Education has been implementing this type of radio education since the 24th year of the Republic (1935), ordering all provincial and municipal secondary schools and mass education centers to equip themselves with radios. It stipulated that at least one-third of secondary schools and mass education centers must have radios installed by December of the 24th year. By December of the 26th year (1937), all secondary schools and mass education centers across the country were to be equipped with radios. Last summer, a training class for broadcasting personnel was also established to train personnel to manage radios, who were then assigned to various provinces and cities to carry out radio education. On the one hand, it was stipulated that experts be hired to broadcast at fixed times each week, with secondary schools as the target on Wednesdays, and the general public as the target four times a week. This year, it is still continuing without interruption. Now, a Radio Education Committee has been organized to study broadcasting issues and plan the promotion of radio education and methods to improve the efficiency of radio education.</p>
<p>Film education: Film is a powerful tool for modern education. If all kinds of knowledge and skills can be made into films and shown to the public, it will be a very powerful tool for enlightening the people, disseminating government information, reforming customs and habits, and unifying the people's will. The Ministry of Education is now working with other relevant agencies to produce educational films, and is ordering educational institutions in various provinces and cities to install projectors to implement film education. Recently, a Film Education Committee has been organized, whose duties are (1) to plan the selection and exchange of foreign educational films, (2) to plan the production of educational films, (3) to plan the promotion of film education, and (4) to study various issues related to the implementation of film education, in order to improve the efficiency of film education. A training class for electro-educational personnel is also being held in the capital to train broadcasting and film education personnel for various provinces and cities, and it has already been in session for many days. The important social education undertakings have already been described separately. As for the total number of social education institutions in the country, according to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), there are a total of 97,591, including 45,951 school-type social education institutions and 51,640 general social education institutions. The number of students in school-type social education institutions is 1,496,986.</p>
<p>5. General Situation of Mongolian and Tibetan Education</p>
<p>Border education in our country lags behind that of the interior. In addition to slightly learning Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui scripts for religious needs, the people know nothing else. As a result, the culture is extremely backward. The National Government, recognizing the mistakes of the past, established the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department in the Ministry of Education in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), dedicated to managing Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and Miao education affairs. Over the years, progress has been made. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Central Government allocated 500,000 yuan for border education, designating various border provinces to conduct Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui education. The Hui elementary schools and Tibetan elementary schools that Gansu Province is planning to establish have already opened in September of this year. Yunnan Province has established three Miao normal schools and 34 Miao elementary schools. Guizhou Province has established one Miao normal school and two Miao elementary schools. Ningxia Province has established one Mongolian and Hui normal school, three Mongolian elementary schools, and two Hui elementary schools. In Suiyuan Province, one National Mongolian Banner Normal School has been established and one or two Mongolian Banner primary and secondary schools have been subsidized. Chahar Province has jointly established a Mongolian normal school with Suiyuan. Xinjiang has established one Hui normal school and more than 1,200 Hui elementary schools. Furthermore, Xikang and Qinghai have also respectively subsidized and restored Mongolian and Tibetan normal classes and many Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui elementary schools. This year, the Central Government is still allocating 500,000 yuan for border education, and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees is subsidizing an additional 200,000 yuan. The Ministry of Education, together with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, will formulate implementation plans and implement them accordingly. The following items must be handled this year:</p>
<p>1.  Consolidate the Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and Miao education undertakings that have already been carried out in the previous year, and increase the number of grades. Establish more normal schools and elementary schools in important places, and gradually carry out vocational education and social education undertakings.</p>
<p>2.  Encourage Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and Miao students to advance to specialized schools above the undergraduate level in the interior. In recent years, due to the Central Government's active promotion of preferential treatment for Mongolian and Tibetan students to advance to higher education, significant results have been achieved. This year, an additional 5,000 yuan has been allocated specifically to subsidize young people from the border areas to advance to specialized schools in the country. 3. Compile and print bilingual Chinese-Tibetan elementary school textbooks and literacy textbooks for the masses, proceeding in the following four steps: (1) The eight volumes of Chinese-Mongolian bilingual national language textbooks and four volumes of short-term elementary school textbooks that have been compiled and translated by the Ministry of Education will be printed and distributed for use in August. (2) The Ministry of Education will hire Tibetan and Hui language experts to translate the short-term Tibetan and Hui language elementary school textbooks first, and print and distribute them for use by the end of October. (3) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission will compile and translate three types of literacy textbooks for civilians in Chinese, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui languages, each with four volumes, which will be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education and printed and distributed for use. All the above books will take Mandarin Chinese as the main body, and will be accompanied by translations and annotations in Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui languages for comparison and reference. However, the Miao people only have language but no writing, so it is planned to use the Mandarin phonetic alphabet to facilitate teaching. (4) Continue to send personnel to inspect the Mongolian, Tibetan, Hui, and Miao education situation in various border provinces. The inspection area is tentatively planned to include the "Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia," "Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang," and "Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou" three major regions, including nine provinces, with one person assigned to each region to conduct inspections and discuss everything with the local officials in charge.</p>
<p>3. Other</p>
<p>The above has briefly discussed the national education situation, including elementary, secondary, higher, social, Mongolian, and Tibetan education. Now, I will briefly discuss the national education funding situation to conclude. According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the funding for elementary education was 10,680,5851 yuan, the funding for secondary education was 56,644,838 yuan, the funding for higher education was 33,574,896 yuan, and the funding for social education was 17,487,812 yuan, totaling 214,513,397 yuan. The above refers to both public and private institutions. In recent years, there have been increases, but there are no accurate statistics available for reporting. End. (The End)</p>

<p>Those who come to the Central Government or various provinces to study shall be handled in accordance with the regulations for Mongolian and Tibetan students. An instruction is issued to all public and private universities to comply.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently issued an instruction to all public and private universities in the country, in order to give preferential treatment to Miao Yi students who come to study at the Central Government or provinces. The case was approved by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, General Character No. 4950, and states that the Southwest Yi Ethnic Culture Promotion Association Nanjing General Assembly has requested to follow the revised regulations for the treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan students, to ensure that Yi children can advance to higher education, etc. It is hereby requested to review and implement accordingly. It is hereby approved that the Miao Yi ethnic groups are also border ethnic groups, and their distribution area is extremely wide. Their cultural level is lower than that of the Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups. At this time of promoting border education, all Miao Yi students who come to the Central Government and various provinces to study should be given special preferential treatment to show encouragement. It is hereby tentatively approved to handle the treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan students in accordance with the provisions of the various articles of the regulations for the treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan students, which were revised and promulgated on June 25th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), No. 8603 by this Department. Those who are recommended by the recommending agency or who impersonate Miao Yi students shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of the regulations. In addition to the reply, a copy of the original consultation and the revised regulations for the treatment of Mongolian and Tibetan students are hereby urgently forwarded for compliance. This order is issued.</p>

<h3 id="e200">The Current Situation of Nursing and Nurse Education in Japan <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Xiren (Described), Zhang Jingmin (Recorded)</p>
<p>After passing through the venereal disease department, you can see many women undergoing electrotherapy. Driven by curiosity, I asked the doctors inside about the names of the diseases. These doctors asked the nurses, who then asked the director to find out. Soon, you see a towering building, which is the most beautiful nursing school in East Asia. The facilities inside are very perfect, and there are many technical testing sites for nursing students: When each student enters the school, they must first be taught how to bathe and how to wash bakelite utensils. We know that Japanese people are not very smart, and they can never make coffee.</p>
<p>Nurse Education and Everything About Nurses</p>
<p>The education systems and educational situations in England, America, China, and Japan are roughly the same: However, nurse education in Japan is entirely handled by experts, taking a division of labor system, unlike our country's professors who take on multiple roles and play solo acts. This educational method is indeed their advantage: It is worthy of our adoption, but they also have their shortcomings, that is, what they learn is not what they use, and learning and application cannot be integrated, so their skills are not very skilled. However, they are absolutely obedient to doctors in terms of both technical aspects and other public and private aspects, as long as the doctors instruct them.</p>
<p>Hospitals in Tokyo</p>
<p>The Japanese call nurses "Kango," and they used to be called "Kangofu." As for the name "Kango," it originated in Japan. We can determine from the vulgarity of this name that Japanese education will not surpass that of China. Within the territory of Tokyo, there are two largest medical institutions with the largest scale: one is the Tokyo Imperial University Hospital, and the other is the Tongren Hospital. In addition to Tokyo Imperial University, each of these two treatment institutions is attached to a nursing school. Of course, one is the Tongren Hospital Nursing School, and the other is the Tokyo Imperial University Attached Nursing School. Among them, the Tongren Nursing School is more magnificent and has more economic resources than the Imperial University Nursing School; because Tongren Hospital is co-sponsored by people from various countries, the scale is great and the economy is very sufficient. In Tokyo, it is one of the leading hospitals, and the general situation is roughly the same as that of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.</p>
<p>Record of Sightings in Tongren Hospital</p>
<p>The principal of a nursing school at Tongren once told us, "If we compare the nursing education in China and Japan, of course China is very advanced, but why is Japan not advanced? There are three major reasons: one, Japanese people can't wash dishes, two, they can't bathe, and three, they can't make coffee. However, what about the Chinese? They can be said to be good at these things," According to what she said, there is indeed a lot of sarcasm in it. Is it possible that Chinese people are only good at doing these lowly things? It is a bit too much and not close to the facts. As for the three things that Japanese people can't do, perhaps they are true. This is what happened when we visited Tongren Hospital.</p>
<p>The career prospects for nurses in Japan are very good, such as in public health, hospital nursing, and private clinics. When it comes to the level of general public health education, it is of course higher than in China. According to reason, Japan's health facilities are undoubtedly higher than those in China, but the fact is the opposite. China's health facilities are more complete than Japan's. As for the level of Japanese nurses entering school, a primary school graduation is enough, and the period of study is three and a half years. The situation in all classes is far inferior to that in China; however, each nurse is very united with other nurses in China, like a group: so when we walk on the streets, we can see the signs of the Nursing Association posted in places where people gather. If a hospital needs nurses, they can contact the association, and the association will introduce them according to the length of time the unemployed have been unemployed, or sometimes advertise for external recruitment.</p>
<p>During this very special period in our country, the Japanese government is paying special attention to nurse education, and almost every citizen has to go through this step. Moreover, at present, nurse education and wartime first aid have been included in national defense education, and are designated as compulsory courses for every citizen during the period of nurse education. If we carefully analyze Japanese nurse education, we can see at a glance from the surface that their level is very low, but the actual work they do is very large and many; it focuses on practice.</p>
<p>There have only been two male nurses in all of Tokyo from the past to the present. They both serve as mental illness nurses. As for the reason for needing male nurses, there are three: one is the social background, two is the economic situation, and three is the social need. Sometimes there is a surplus of nurses, and sometimes there are not enough nurses to use. This phenomenon of mismatch between supply and demand is rare in Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Explanation of Blood Transfusion (Part 1) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Yisheng</p>
<p>On October 5th, the Shen Bao published an article in which lawyer Yuan proposed a suggestion to the Bar Association to request an explanation from the authorities as to whether blood transfusion is illegal. While the intention of helping the poor and supporting the rich, and prioritizing life and health, is commendable, it is based on a lack of understanding and purely personal emotions. Therefore, I have some objections. The original text has two main points: (1) Any body from which blood is drawn will immediately suffer damage to its health. Voluntarily accepting injury is no different from suicide, and there is guilt in instigating or assisting others to commit suicide. (2) Buying and selling blood is of no practical benefit to the patient. Even if it is beneficial, the purpose is to make the rich stronger and the poor weaker, the rich live and the poor die. (Omission in the middle)—Occasionally, when a patient loses too much blood, in order to avoid the greater of two evils, they choose to transfuse blood of the same type from within the same clan. This practice exists in Western countries, but making a profit from it is absolutely prohibited. Now, I will provide a point-by-point explanation as follows:</p>
<p>(1) (A) The average blood volume of an adult is 4.5 liters. A blood transfusion volume of 200 to 800 cubic centimeters (cc) causes the blood donor a loss that is completely restored within a few hours, and will definitely not lead to anemia or damage to health. This is because the metabolism of blood is constantly occurring. After a small loss, the blood-producing organs are stimulated and work faster, producing blood more quickly.</p>
<p>(B) Conditions for blood transfusion: (A) For the blood donor: there is absolutely no harm to the blood donor's health, and it is beneficial to the recipient's ailing body. Therefore, the physical examination must be absolutely strict. (1) Only young, strong people with no suspicion of infectious diseases are suitable. (2) The blood type identification must be carefully done. If the blood types match, the recipient will accept it without any problems. If they do not match, agglutination will occur, leading to death in an instant. (3) Once the blood donor's blood type is known and the physical condition is suitable, and they are registered at the hospital, they must maintain their good health. This is because blood type is fixed from birth, but good health cannot be guaranteed to be constant. All things that damage good health should be strictly warned against and carefully protected. (4) Blood transfusion should not be performed repeatedly within a considerable period.</p>
<p>(B) For the recipient: the doctor makes a purely scientific judgment that there is an absolute need, such as "life depends on it, death without it," such as (1) simple acute excessive blood loss, life hanging by a thread, the body's own blood has no time for metabolism and lacks the ability. If the doctor uses physiological saline to help, although the quantity can be increased, the quality is too thin, and they must use the blood of others to bring the dead back to life and achieve miraculous results instantly. (2) Anemia caused by disease or (3) when severe illnesses cannot be treated with medication, blood not only nourishes the body but is also the main base for the body's fight against disease. Blood transfusion increases nutrition and can also be seen as a fresh force. The body's own blood gets some external help, accelerating metabolism and strengthening resistance.</p>
<p>Overall, blood transfusion is absolutely harmless and beneficial to the blood donor. (1) If you have a hidden illness, you can find out during the physical examination and not miss the opportunity for treatment. (2) Your blood type becomes known. If you suffer a serious injury or critical illness, you can immediately become a recipient, saving the time-consuming blood testing procedure and avoiding endangering your life. (3) You must maintain your good health, at least to the extent that you dare not frequent prostitutes or contract venereal diseases, so as not to lose your eligibility to be a blood donor. So, where is the injury? Where is the suicide? Lightly accusing doctors of criminal responsibility for inciting or assisting suicide is illogical, fabricating crimes, and should not be done! I will imitate his tone and say that blood transfusion saves lives. Obstructing blood transfusion is obstructing saving lives. Obstructing saving lives is no different from killing. Killers are guilty. However, I definitely do not want to say such things. The author's intention is kind. As for hospitals seeking people to register in advance, the recipient's need is a matter of life and death, at a critical juncture. Sometimes the condition is so critical that one person's blood transfusion is not enough to save a life, and multiple people must share the responsibility and change people repeatedly. Examining the physical condition and testing blood types on the spot is not possible within the time constraints. The meaning of preparing ahead is easily understood. Someone might say you are indeed good at arguing, because I have heard of people fainting from blood transfusion in Peiping. I say, yes, yes, this is a psychological effect, not a blood loss effect! Chinese people have always valued blood, especially men. Women's psychology should be more fragile than men's. Why don't we hear of women fainting when they have their periods? It is a common occurrence. Nor have we heard of healthy women becoming bloodless because of excessive menstruation. This is metabolism. This can also prove that blood transfusion is harmless to health, without a doubt. With the psychology of valuing blood, selling it one day will initially cause terror and ultimately regret and anger, and then they might faint. And there are people who faint even when they see a little bit of their own blood flowing. When I tested people for Wassermann reaction, taking only 4 cc of blood, three people fainted: two men and one woman.</p>
<p>(2) Practical benefits for the patient: Just looking at Shanghai alone, the hospitals use blood transfusion to revive the dying and restore flesh to bones. These are ironclad facts that can be verified. The original text says "of no practical benefit to the patient," and the next sentence immediately follows with "even if it is beneficial." How well does Lawyer Yuan use the word "even"! I speculate that his conscience when writing could not directly deny the miraculous achievements of blood transfusion. He hesitated slightly and then added the word "even." Wonderful! "Even setting aside blood transfusion itself and talking about the rich and poor, the rich are rich in wealth but poor in blood, and the poor are poor in wealth but rich in blood. Using surplus to make up for deficiencies, mutually benefiting each other is fair and just. Measured by the meaning of obligations and rights, what is wrong with it? Moreover, blood donors save people from the brink of death, which is great benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence and righteousness bring profit, and all three are beautiful. If Mencius were resurrected today, he would not have the lament 'Why must you speak of profit?'" As for the situation in Western countries, I will briefly mention two things to prove it. (1) There are many American and British soldiers stationed in Shanghai who voluntarily sell blood and register at hospitals. The original author can go to various hospitals to investigate or even request on-site observation to prove it. (2) My friend Dr. Zhu Gonghong received his doctorate and transfused blood many times while studying in the United States, earning 20 to 100 US dollars each time. The American and British military are strict in discipline and pay attention to hygiene. If blood transfusion were harmful to health, how could they allow individuals to indulge in profit? Dr. Zhu's physical condition is as strong as ever, and he says, "I didn't feel weak or tired at all at the time. All large and small hospitals in the United States have a roster of blood donors." The claim that it is limited to the same clan and absolutely prohibits profit is based on what?</p>
<p>(3) Legal Observation (A) The issue of blood transfusion itself: in everything, one party benefits and the other suffers harm. Those who suffer harm enjoy legal protection. Those who harm others to benefit themselves are subject to legal sanctions to a certain extent. Currently, both blood recipients and blood donors benefit, so the issue of blood transfusion itself is legal, without a doubt. (B) When a doctor performs blood transfusion, the recipient benefits and the donor is unharmed. How can it be said that the rich are showing off their wealth and using money to lure the poor? They are simply using scientific knowledge and skills to save people! (C) Legal questions in the original text: those who publicly comment on people and affairs in writing should base every word and every sentence on solid evidence, especially when making suggestions to the Bar Association, requesting submissions to judicial administrative organs, and especially when it comes from the hand of a lawyer, and especially when it concerns human life! According to scientific principles, one should also speak with evidence.</p>

<p>— Jiang Yeping</p>
<p>The seasons are changing one by one. It is said that today is changing from the "year of cholera" to the "year of malaria"! Of course, we do not believe in the fulfillment of prophecies, but the season of summer and autumn transition is a period of rampant disease. This is undeniable, with reality staring the public in the face. Past experiences confirm that the arrival of each summer is as terrifying as bringing disease and death.</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(106) Speech and Voice Disorders Arising from Nasal Diseases</p>
<p>We have two types of breathing: nasal breathing and oral breathing. Therefore, the nasal cavity plays an important part in breathing. At the same time, it also has a close relationship with speech and sound, which is the so-called resonance effect of the nasal cavity. If there is a lesion in the nasal cavity, the resonance effect of the nasal cavity during vocalization will be abnormal. Its pitch will also clearly lose its normal state. This abnormal pitch is called nasal tone in medicine. Speech disorders due to nasal cavity lesions can be roughly divided into two categories.</p>
<p>(1) Obstructive Nasal Voice—Obstructive nasal voice is commonly seen in nasal colds (commonly known as head colds), hypertrophic rhinitis, adhesions in the nasal cavity, infiltration, ulceration, nasopharyngeal adhesions, and tumors. The degree varies, mostly depending on the location and severity of the nasal pain. In severe cases, the resonance effect of the nasal cavity can be completely abolished.</p>
<p>(2) Open Nasal Voice—Open nasal voice is more common in atrophy, destruction, and perforation of nasal tissues, perforation of the palate, defects of the soft palate, and infiltration. This is because when vocalizing, most of the exhaled air enters the nasal cavity.</p>
<p>(107) Nerve Disorders and Reflex Nerve Symptoms Arising from Nasal Diseases</p>
<p>Among the general nerve disorders arising from nasal diseases, the most common is headache. Headaches can be divided into two types: localized and widespread. Localized ones are limited to a local area, such as the root of the nose, the forehead, the temples, the top of the head, and the back of the head. Widespread ones radiate and affect the entire head. The intensity of the headache also varies. In mild cases, there is only a feeling of pressure. In severe cases, there is severe, stabbing pain. At this time, patients are mostly in great distress. Among nasal diseases, the most common and easiest to cause headaches are nasal obstruction and sinusitis. In addition, so-called nerve disorders include insomnia, early feelings of mental or physical fatigue, general fatigue, weakness, memory loss, and nasal attention deficit, etc. Among them, the so-called nasal attention deficit is more common in patients with high-degree nasal obstruction (mostly due to adenoid hypertrophy). They often cannot concentrate their attention and are often accompanied by memory loss and dizziness.</p>
<p>As for reflex nerve symptoms, they are generally characterized by asthma, nocturia, nervous tinnitus, cough, and genital disorders.</p>
<p>Recently, from newspapers and news, we have seen and heard of groups of precious lives dying from malignant malaria. This tragic news is constantly spreading, spreading quickly and widely. What a miserable and terrifying thing.</p>
<p>Everyone, who wants to send their own life to the god of death? But if you contract a disease and do not treat it properly, the illness will worsen, even to death. This is the inevitable result. Especially an infectious disease? It is very serious. Almost all counties in Jiangsu are experiencing this infectious disease. It's really scary!</p>
<p>Now we ask why malignant malaria is spreading like this? On the one hand, it is certainly related to the climate? But the biggest problem is the lack of prevention. Everyone knows that prevention is easier and more effective than treatment. Someone once said, "Modern medicine has progressed from therapeutic medicine to preventive medicine." But why is malignant malaria allowed to grow so severely? Although preventive medicine and preventive measures in China are still in their infancy, the public's lack of hygiene knowledge and the formality of attention from prevention agencies are also a major reason.</p>
<p>From this, we have learned a great lesson: health agencies should not only do some treatment work and formal publicity but should also pay close attention to the prevention of diseases for the public. For this type of malignant malaria, if we can pay attention to how to prevent it before it occurs or has not yet occurred, and if the health agencies publicize it to the public or enforce prevention, then I believe that at least the mortality rate will definitely not be so high!</p>
<p>Since what has happened in the past is already the past, then how should health agencies promote preventive medicine in the future? How to teach the public to pay attention to disease prevention? Now let's take an example: such as the provincial health office, its mission is of course to pay attention to public health and disease prevention, but in reality? How much effectiveness has it actually achieved? It is only the public in the provincial capital who enjoy its benefits! But what about the countryside? It is a question mark.</p>
<p>But in substance, comparing the number of deaths from malignant malaria this year in rural and urban areas, the number of deaths in rural areas is several times higher than in urban areas. Therefore, from this point, it is necessary to pay immediate attention to "rural hygiene"! This is not just an empty slogan; it is indeed a very important issue related to the health of the nation! Once an infectious disease occurs in the countryside, it is impossible to stop it. What a miserable thing! Here, we can provide some suggestions: we hope that the government will help each county organize "rural medical and health mobile teams" to take on the responsibility of teaching the public about disease prevention and at the same time train the public to know basic hygiene common sense. It is best to establish a voluntary health agency in each district office to be responsible for the health affairs of the district. Also, it is best to often give disguised speeches and use public gatherings to impart profound hygiene common sense.</p>
<p>Another point is why the public does not know how to pay attention to disease and hygiene? Of course, the public's superstitious beliefs are too deep! At the same time, there is no concrete understanding of scientific medicine. The biggest point is that the shackles of the economy bind them, and they can only use superstitious psychology to anesthetize patients, or hire quack doctors to temporarily comfort the sick. This is a very scary thing! Now, if we want to eliminate and sweep away harmful ideas and thoughts, the most important point is that we must educate the public!</p>
<p>We know that the reason for the failure of health agencies in the past is that they only paid attention to form and did not know how to enrich the content? In other words, this is the path that should be worked hard in the future! Everyone knows that the achievements of health agencies are the most difficult to fully demonstrate! We fully acknowledge this, but if the work of the health cause is diligent, we can say that the epidemic of infectious diseases and the reduction of the mortality rate can at least be reduced and lowered.</p>
<p>Now we summarize the above words, to make the public pay attention to disease prevention, the first requirement is to enrich their hygiene knowledge. The second is to pay immediate attention to "rural hygiene." The third is to set up more health agencies in the countryside. The fourth is to correct the public's misconceptions about scientific medicine. The fifth is to hope that health agencies start by enriching the content. Finally, we hope that all intellectuals will do their best to help publicize hygiene, and then it will be easy!</p>

<p>The gold market continued to strengthen yesterday due to the further rise in pure gold. However, there were also many sellers. It weakened slightly in the middle, but the bulls aggressively increased their positions and the bears also covered, resulting in further gains. In the early morning, overseas silver markets showed slight gains, and the London silver forward price rose between 0.6 and 1.0 percent.

<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange turned tired. Although it generally remained sideways, large players such as No. 4 tended to sell, while the northern group took the opportunity to cover at low prices. In the end, it failed to break away from the principle of returning after a slight decline. Among the environmental factors, the most noteworthy was the multiple incidents in North China and the deteriorating situation in Suidong. However, before there is a significant development, the bond market will still be in a sideways state. The course of yesterday was dominated by selling pressure at the opening. It is said that the selling of No. 4 had a significant background. Sellers on the market were seen to be enthusiastic. Bonds such as No. 8, 16, 32, and 47 were sold off. The market price unanimously trended weaker. Except for the B type for this month, which was still good by 5 cents, the rest were uniformly down by 5 cents to 1 jiao.

<h3 id="e208">Cotton Yarn, Yarn Prices Get New Boost <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was tired in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but now yarn sales have turned dull. Customers are slow to purchase. The prices for November delivery yarn are now equal to the spot yarn prices. There are still many people who sell when prices rise. It is said that after the New Year, some yarn factories may have labor strikes, with workers demanding wage increases. At the same time, Osaka Sampin (Three Products) yarn has recently seen a speculative surge of six yuan, boosting morale, and market prices have returned to a favorable state.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Rebound After the New Year</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for futures yarn showed tight conditions for this month's delivery due to the scarcity of spot yarn. Prices continued to rise. Further-dated contracts were relatively stable. After the second session, news of sluggish yarn sales and easing raw cotton prices caused the market to decline. The result of the futures trading was unchanged for this month's delivery, while further-dated contracts fell by four, five, and seven jiao (cents) compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, the market situation for this month's delivery tightened again. Rumors of labor strikes in factories boosted morale. At the same time, Osaka Sampin yarn market surged sharply, further hardening the market. The result of the futures trading was that prices for all months rose by one yuan, three, five, seven, and eight jiao compared to the morning closing price.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Continuous Arrivals, Cotton Pre-Market Selling Pressure Intense, Afternoon Profit-Taking Rebound Tightens Market <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rebounded. Initially, abundant arrivals from various routes and increased inventory levels dampened morale. Subsequently, a favorable yarn market and a rebound in the Osaka Sampin cotton market, coupled with expectations of a slight increase in US cotton estimates for tomorrow, led to rising market prices and a sharp rise in buying interest, rebounding by 2.3 jiao. However, this month's contract broke through the 40-yuan mark.</p>
<p>(This Month's Contract Re-enters the 40-Yuan Level)</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for cotton futures was characterized by weak sentiment due to hopes of an increase in US cotton estimates, intensifying selling pressure. Large traders poured in to sell, flooding the market, and prices steadily declined. The near-term contract broke through the 40-yuan mark. The result of the futures trading was that prices for all months fell by four, five, six, and seven jiao compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>The afternoon session opened with a rebound in Osaka Sampin cotton, leading profit-takers to cover their positions, tightening the market and boosting momentum. As a result, prices for all months rose by two and three jiao compared to the morning closing price.</p>
<p>Sales included: Heyu 22,800 dan (a unit of weight), Yuda 16,100 dan, Huamao 1,800 dan, Renfeng 2,100 dan, Wuyi 3,400 dan, Dachangcheng 2,600 dan, Dachang 3,200 dan, Changhe 11,400 dan, Senkang 3,500 dan, Runkang 3,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,500 dan, Hengyi 3,700 dan, Zhenda 8,100 dan, Jinchang 4,000 dan, Qingfeng 12,800 dan, Shenchang 2,800 dan, Shenji 2,400 dan, Taichang 5,000 dan, Yichang 4,500 dan, Changfeng 5,000 dan, Shengyuan 4,300 dan, Fukang 3,000 dan, Xinchang 3,000 dan.</p>

<p>Following the dispute over the April standard yarn and cotton contracts at the Chinese Merchants' Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange, the May contract was removed on the 6th. It was found that 18,650 bales of cotton yarn and 21,400 dan of cotton were traded. The directors of the exchange went to Beijing to petition, and have already returned to Shanghai. According to the market, the cotton yarn price (closing price on the 5th) was 214.6 yuan. The long side compensated 1 yuan, and the short side compensated 5 jiao. The cotton price (closing price on the 5th) was 41.55 yuan. The long side compensated 2.5 jiao, and the short side compensated 5 jiao. It is said that one party is still dissatisfied with this arrangement, and the final outcome remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Bombay: Last week, export merchants bought large quantities of cotton futures, all supplied by local counterparts. The movement of Oomra cotton was delayed due to rain in the area, but the harvest was abundant. As of October 16, there were 123,973 bales of packed cotton, compared to only 48,193 bales last year. Export inquiries from Japan are quite good, with small quantities being shipped urgently and for New Year's shipments. Demand from the mainland is quiet. Lancashire is paying attention to Karachi cotton. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw a sharp rise in the price of Sanpin yarn, and the situation of both futures and spot yarn was firm. Japanese trading houses and factories raised the prices of white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and 84 cloth by 1-2 jiao per piece, which improved morale, and customer sales gradually started to pick up. Dyeing factories on this street replenished their stocks of dyed fine cloth and fine twill for both spot and futures delivery by more than 500 bales. Dealers along the Yangtze River, such as Changsha, Changde, Hankou, and Anqing, increased their purchases, and transactions were mainly for fine twill, fine cloth, printed flannelette, serge, drill, and white flannelette from Chinese and foreign factories. Among them, Hankou merchants purchased the largest amount of fine cloth and fine twill, exceeding 800 pieces, with brisk actual sales. The cloth sales market also turned prosperous. Yesterday, merchants from this street and the Yangtze River purchased 400-500 bales, and spot goods are gradually becoming scarce. The inventory of patterned goods and flannelette on the market is also low, and sales are particularly smooth. Selling prices have generally not changed, but the selling prices of colored cloth and colored twill from various factories have gradually increased due to the rising price of grey cloth.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market saw active trading, and standard prices were very firm. Prices generally opened higher in the morning and closed even higher in the evening. Street runners and brokers were very busy, and goods at the original price were often out of stock. The strength of the market was truly rare in the past three to five years. Therefore, most woolen fabric brokers with some reputation or financial resources are absorbing goods or paying deposits in advance, using skillful tactics to make profits. On the other hand, those who work hard to run around find it difficult to profit, because the market is short of goods, and sellers mostly want cash, and even refuse to cut small samples.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Grains: Rumors of Australian Wheat Price Approaching, Futures Flour Market Sentiment Turns Soft, Yesterday's Results Decline by Two or Three Points, Security Deposit Returns to Old Rules Today, 250 Yuan Per 1,000 Bags <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of all months were initially stable and then fell sharply. When the prices of foreign wheat were quoted, Chicago was slightly better by nearly a jiao, and Canada was lower by four or five fen. When the prices were opened, sentiment was still stable, and this month's to January's contracts were slightly better by about one fen. When February's price was opened, sentiment gradually softened. Because the market widely rumored that there was news about Australian wheat, and the current asking price was 8.76 yuan (about 8-9 jiao different from the standard here), this reason caused sentiment to soften. The previous continuous rise, fearing that wheat production would not be sufficient for application, is now difficult to sustain. When the afternoon session opened, sentiment was even softer, falling by nearly a fen compared to the morning session. Because the environment is gradually changing, speculation from outside the industry will inevitably decrease, so subsequent steps will gradually become flat. The exchange market is also stable. It is now set that from the 10th, the security deposit will return to normal, which is 250 yuan per 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the prices of all months declined across the board. When it first opened, sentiment was still stable, but because the flour market saw mediocre sales and no demand for food purchases, the market atmosphere felt flat and tired despite the scarce transactions. When the afternoon session opened, sentiment slackened again. Because there was news of Australian wheat being sold, it was inevitable that people would be fearful. Some speculative longs hastily exited, and the market continued to fall by four or five fen. According to speculation by people in the industry, the previous sharp rise was excessive and caused unnecessary anxiety. Now, although foreign wheat is still difficult to order, there are already problems with the actual supply, and changes in sentiment are also expected. The spot wheat market has already seen a large loosening. Special high-quality goods are only asking for 6 yuan (down a jiao compared to the highest), and medium-quality goods are all within the 5-jiao range. Only Fufeng sold 4-5,000 bags throughout the day, and the rest were not purchased.</p>

<p>Ke Xian rice was still in demand the day before yesterday, and the market was inherently weak. However, yesterday, the purchasing interest of Japanese merchants became active. Guangdong continued to inquire about brown rice yesterday, and Henan continued to purchase machine-milled rice. Xiamen and Ningbo also purchased a small number of bagged rice and broken rice. Purchasing interest on this street was particularly active, so although transactions were small, the market has stabilized. Once the Guangdong merchants started loading brown rice, the price jumped up by another jiao. Yangzi brown rice opened at 8.9 yuan, and Xiang brown rice opened at 8.7 yuan. Other types of rice remained stable due to more inventory. Today, 2,700 bags of Jiangxi rice, 774 bags of Xiang rice, 900 bags of Wu Xian rice, 1,240 bags of Wen, Tai, and Yong rice, and 231 bags of Han brown rice were offered.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various guilds totaled more than 90, with a total of 11,130 shi (a unit of volume) of goods arriving. The sales market on this street was flat. However, the Pingjin, Qingyan, and other guilds continued to purchase more than 4,000 bags of Bo Dao rice and nearly 1,000 bags of Yuanxin Geng rice. Therefore, the thick Geng rice market showed a situation of high and stable prices, with the middle level being tired. Bo Dao rice saw quite a lot of leftover goods from the day before yesterday, making it difficult to maintain the high prices, which continued to depreciate by a jiao. Supply and demand were similar in the middle range, with no gains or losses. Duyang Tip saw slightly less shop interest, and the price was adjusted by five fen. There was no change in Xin Yin Yuan, and Xin Bian Yuan was reduced by another chi (a unit of length). The situation of Bo Dao rice was only average.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from the river were rare, with only 30 vendors. The market was generally quiet. The price of Xin Geng rice was peaceful. Both domestic and foreign demand for Bo Dao rice were not refreshing, and the price was down a small jiao. The price of Yin Bian Yuan was firm. Du Bu Tip was stable. Yang Tip and Ke Tip saw slightly more activity in the evening market, and the price was slightly tighter.</p>

<p>The trend of soybeans is inseparable from the influence of Dalian. Recently, the Dalian market reported a rebound, and the local bean cake sales market was also active. Yesterday, the Shantou guild ordered more than 10,000 pieces of Four-Brand cake for delivery to various factories in January and February. Moreover, the source of soybeans transported by train was sparse, and the cargo owners sold tightly, causing the market atmosphere to turn stable in the midst of a weary situation. Yesterday, the entire market traded more than 3,000 bags of various soybeans, which were divided between local train workshops and this street. Foreign-owned pure sesame still only had short covering transactions. Yesterday, 150 metric tons were traded, and the price was 12.825 yuan. The market was largely unchanged. The foreign market was tired, and foreign firms did not move. The spot raw sesame was still hard. The source was not surging, and there were scattered sales to local Shao and other companies yesterday, totaling 30 bags of Tushan white sesame and 50 bags of Dali Ji yellow sesame.</p>

<p>Longkou vermicelli and dried noodles have not arrived in large quantities recently, and production prices are relatively high, requiring about 25 yuan. More than a thousand bags had previously been opened here, with prices ranging from 24.7 to 8 yuan. Inventory is gradually scarce, and most are in the hands of various businesses, but the number is only a few thousand bags. The demand from the Japanese street and inland is still good. Export companies are purchasing at a relatively higher rate. Yesterday, the business price was 14 yuan on this street, and the inland price (92 skin, 98 skin) was 24 yuan. Export companies were asking for 25 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and soft, with little change. The guild's price was 20.65 yuan for spot No. 24 coarse sugar, 6.05 yuan for transit goods, and the same price for Dong White No. 489 and this factory's Mian White Zhenji Jinxin Dahua. The number board had a Guangdong merchant opening with more than 200 boxes of Hai Pian Qing at 10.04 yuan, and a Hu merchant opening with dozens of bags of Huanggang Qing at 12.9 yuan, which was slightly looser than before. According to letters from the production area, the number of new Chaoqing is small and the price is stable due to less rain. If it does not rain again, the debut of the new crop will inevitably be delayed, and it will probably not be seen until around the Winter Solstice.</p>
<p>The jointly established company held its first bid to redeem Guangdong sugar this week, with a total quota of 7,707 bags. The bid price was slightly less than a jiao. Shunde Factory's Wuyang Coarse White, 1,180 bags, were sold at 21.3 yuan. City's New Factory also sold 200 bags at 21.1 yuan. Shantou also sold 110 bags at 20.9 yuan.

<p>"It takes one year to kill a tree, ten years to grow a tree, and a hundred years to cultivate a person." Therefore, those who govern the country must struggle through the difficult and arduous path of being as cautious as approaching a deep abyss and treading on thin ice in order to carve out a path to life. This great path built with blood and sweat requires sacrificing millions of heads as a cornerstone-laying ceremony before there is a hope of completion.</p>
<p>Inferring from the differences in years between killing a tree, growing a tree, and cultivating a person, if we want to place the country on the security of a solid rock, then we must at least consider a century-long plan. From the Opium War to the present, there have been nearly a hundred years. The invasions and humiliations suffered during these hundred years are truly unimaginable. Several million square li of the country and tens of millions of compatriots are reaching out to us for help in the darkness. This is the great responsibility we must shoulder, and this is the responsibility we must keep in mind every day and never forget.</p>
<p>In order to complete the century-long plan of establishing the country, the first requirement is that we must be self-reliant. If anyone wants to infringe upon our self-existence and self-reliance or hinder our self-existence and self-reliance, then we can only fight them to the death, because only by fighting to the death can we find a way out of desperation. Now we have reached the final juncture mentioned above, and it remains to be seen whether the aggressors can pull back from the brink. In order to ensure the great plan of the country's self-existence and self-reliance, 450 million compatriots have already stood on the same front.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Friendship <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>What exactly does friendship look like? How exactly should it be maintained? I don't know.</p>
<p>When I stepped out of the school gate, I used to see more than five classmates. Not only did we write to each other three times a month, but we also had a considerable amount of friendship. Day and night, we would do certain things together. What's more, they thought highly of me, and they would never forget to give me a red card or a white card for weddings, funerals, and celebrations. And I always went to congratulate or mourn within the possible range. Then, I got married myself and sent out red cards, but three of them didn't respond. A year later, my late father passed away, and I sent out white cards, and then there were four more. They didn't offer condolences to me, and they stopped communicating. A year later, I lost my job, so I wrote letters to the classmates who still had friendships, asking them to pay attention to introducing me to jobs. Unexpectedly, after this letter was sent out, only four of them replied, promising to pay attention to it. The rest simply had no news at all. To this day, everyone doesn't know where they have gone. One of those four who remained, because I had moved a sum of money from him once, was afraid to meet me and didn't communicate with me either. Although I returned both loans with interest as scheduled, without any arrears, he was unhappy to associate with me because of this, which was also an unavoidable matter. There was also one who had asked me to borrow ten yuan, and then asked me to borrow five yuan. From then on, he hid from me from afar when he saw me on the street. At the end of the year, the New Year's card didn't come either. The New Year's card I sent wasn't returned by the post office either. It turned out that he had moved to who knows where. The third one asked me to borrow a very considerable amount of money, but I couldn't help because I didn't have the ability, and I replied refusing him. As a result, I received his letter of severance filled with complaints and resentment. Now, the only classmate who still maintains friendship is only one left, but I don't know if this one will also abandon me one day.</p>
<p>Four years ago, I used to date a girlfriend. This girlfriend's temperament was gentle, her conversation was refined, and her knowledge was above the waterline. Because she was similar to my habits, the two of us developed a very close friendship. I am a married man, and I am driven by the spurs of life, absolutely not possessing any ambitions. Therefore, my attitude towards that girlfriend absolutely did not cross the boundaries of friendship. Although we wrote to each other two or three times a month and talked on the phone four or five times, and even went to see plays and travel to the suburbs together, we absolutely did not involve any private affairs. After interacting for three years, she subtly revealed her intention to be my life partner, and I hastily and righteously refused. Then, she found a partner and held a wedding. When she got married, I also went to congratulate her very sincerely. Unexpectedly, after she got married, she abandoned her original friendship. Both times I went to visit, she said she wasn't home. Once, she was walking on the street with her husband, and when she saw me at a glance, she lowered her head and pretended not to see me. Recently, I wrote a letter of greeting, and a week later, I received her reply, saying that in order to avoid suspicion, she asked me not to write any more letters in the future. I then knew that what we originally had wasn't friendship at all.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Review of the National Cartoon Exhibition <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>The "National Cartoon Exhibition," which everyone had been looking forward to for a long time, finally opened on the 4th of this month at Daxin. According to the person in charge, this exhibition was prepared in a hurry, so although the name written on it was "National," in reality "national writers" were not able to be gathered in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>However, in terms of quantity, it is already very considerable. As for the quality, it seems to be somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>The history of comics in China is very short, but it has been able to forge ahead to this point in a very short period of time and obtain such excellent fruits. This is already no easy task. Originally, we shouldn't have any more harsh demands. However, the mission of comics is to stand on the front lines of the era like a suicide squad and charge! Kill! Moreover, the current world situation and the current Chinese society can no longer tolerate leisurely, intoxicated, amorous, carnal, or even meaningless comic books. Instead, it needs to strike at the central ideology, contain profound meaning, express the dynamics of world thought, expose the darkness of current society, and bear the inescapable responsibility of holding the authority of humor and satire that can influence social thought, improve social customs, and build the will of young people.</p>
<p>For example, the few monochrome comics signed by Chen Yifan in the exhibition show that the author's skills and thoughts are quite cultivated. There are no bright colors on the surface of his books, but they can attract the audience. It makes people want to see it again after seeing it, and it really has the effect of so-called never getting tired of watching. Of course, some people say that comics do not need to emphasize skills, as long as they have thoughts. That's right, if you can be like Mr. Chen, with both skills and thoughts, wouldn't it be more perfect? Furthermore, such as the few comic portraits of Guangyu, Zhengyu, and Qianyu; of course, you can't read anything meaningful from portraits, but they all have pure and wonderful skills, so they also give the audience a deep impression. There are also several "artistic" comic books signed by Hua Lu, whose colors, lines, and composition are extremely fresh, "purely artistic", and "genius." But, it's a pity that "thought" is not very sound.</p>
<p>There are many other good works that cannot be introduced one by one. In short, like the ones mentioned above, their common shortcoming is that they pay too much attention to fun. In other words, there are too few progressive things, and there are too many boring things. Regarding this, we are very interested in expecting, expecting them to give us a satisfactory answer at the second National Cartoon Exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Goldfish Ramblings <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, a strange drought has persisted, leaving pools and ponds parched for days. The water fleas, the goldfish's only food source, have disappeared as a result. Recently, goldfish breeders in Shanghai have all switched to feeding porridge grains. As for those who rely on fish for a living, they usually venture out in all directions to catch them, but it is often difficult to even get one-tenth of what they need. Therefore, this year, "Fat Heads" rarely exceed two inches in length. If a breeder has one or two hundred tanks, the fish's bodies become thin and their spines weakened. I have heard that in some gardens, the well water has dried up, and there is no way to carry water. The small fish are left to wither, and the fish servants look up to the sky and sigh, wondering what to do.</p>
<p>Recently, my mother-in-law became ill with asthma and was sent home. During my leisure time, I inquired with fellow fish breeders in the Suzhou area. They said that they have not been able to provide live food for over a month and are using porridge to nurture them. They all believe that the fish market will be a poor one this year. The impact of the drought on aquatic products is indeed significant.</p>
<p>Since I designed and customized "fish cups" for Guanshengyuan this spring, several hundred dozen have sold like hotcakes. From this, I know that there are many more fish lovers in Shanghai. I once commissioned a kiln to produce a kind of "Qingsha fish tank," imitating the small size of Tianjin tanks but with a wider opening, allowing for ample sunlight. I named it "Tan." The first batch of twenty were quickly taken by friends. I have ordered dozens more. Gentlemen such as Chen Renhe, Zhou Jianyun, and Xi Yushu have all placed several in their residences. Using "Tan" to raise goldfish has several advantages, such as producing plump bodies, short bodies, prominent head and horns, large and strong tails that spread out in four directions, easy greening of the water, and hearty appetites. This spring, I chose fish with correct body shapes to raise in the "Tan," placing twenty fish in each "Tan" and giving them plenty of live food every day. I added water every night. After ten days, the fish had grown larger by one inch (originally half an inch, now one inch). I then scooped out ten fish and raised them separately, feeding them in the same way. In less than half a month, they doubled in size again. If you want them to grow even bigger, you can move them to a cement pond, providing them with ample food and constantly flushing the water. After a summer, this year's goldfish will have grown to four inches. It is said that fish in ponds will inevitably grow long, but after dozens of days of regulation in the "Tan," you can be sure that they will not have to worry about losing their shape. Bao Tianxiao also raises several tanks of famous pearl goldfish in his Shanghai residence. Among them, there are only two or three pairs of "water bubble eye" fish with inverted heads, which have been raised in the "Tan" and are rarely seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>I met with Mr. Fan Yunshu, Director of Suzhou Park, who told me that the annual goldfish and chrysanthemum exhibition has been scheduled in cooperation with the Suzhou Agricultural School and will be held around November 10th in the park. They are seeking submissions of famous goldfish and chrysanthemums from public and private collections in the Wuzhong area. The grand occasion at that time can be predicted, and I will write more after viewing it.</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Salaried Class <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Manzi</p>
<p>The average salaried person experiences two kinds of suffering: first, the lack of financial support after retirement; and second, the lack of security in the event of disability during their working life. Obviously, there are many factories, schools, and businesses that have group insurance, pensions, and bereavement benefits, but these are in the minority. For the vast majority, just receiving their monthly salary on time, without any delay, is already a cause for great joy.</p>
<p>"Night Meeting" depicts a chemist who is loyal to his factory. Fearing that an explosion of chemicals would destroy the entire factory, he risked his life to protect it, resulting in injuries to his eyes. The factory, seeing that he was disabled, gave him some medical expenses and a small sum of money, terminating his employment. A happy family that depended entirely on his salary was plunged into a tragic situation. Observers lamented: In this day and age, can those who live on salaries really have no security? I think that anyone who hears this will feel a pang of bitterness in their heart.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it depicts a woman without higher education who, in order to secure her family's livelihood, does not hesitate to sacrifice her appearance and work as a general hostess in a nightclub. The meager salary she earns is barely enough to make ends meet, and she is unable to meet her needs. As a result, she is forced to kill. Aren't female hostesses a very common and growing part of the salaried class in today's society? When they put on smiling faces to greet customers, the customers only focus on their appearance. Who can imagine that behind them, there is a group of starving family members? Who can see the immeasurable pain in their hearts?</p>
<p>Therefore, "Night Meeting" is nothing less than a cry for the salaried class, a demand for a solution for the salaried class. Its significance is very serious. I hope that the audience will not be dazzled by the magnificent scenes, intoxicated by the bright lights and alcohol, or fascinated by the charming smiles, because this film resonates with millions of salaried people.</p>

<p>Chapter 8: Vows of Allegiance over a Cup of Water, Whispers of Sorrow under a Green Lamp; Agreements Sealed with Golden Rings, Messages of Love Borne by Red Beans</p>
<p>The subject I have the least confidence in is geometry. Randomly flipping through the book, I find every question vague. I must take advantage of this cool weather to memorize more theorems. So, I calmed my mind and picked up a geometry book. In the past, when I calmed down to read, I could always absorb some of it into my brain. But today, the more I read, the more confused I become. So, I put the book aside for a while and picked up a magazine from the bookshelf. Flipping through it, I found several small poems full of emotion. After reading them, I found them quite enjoyable to recite. After reciting them, and then carefully savoring them, I felt my heart fill with flavor. Unconsciously, I spent an hour reading the magazine. Then I remembered that it was time to review my lessons. How could I waste my time so casually? So, I moved the magazine aside and picked up my lessons again. I repeated these actions, flipping back and forth, unable to control myself. Soon, it was after dinner, and the room was lit. I was lost in thought under the light, wondering how to spend this lonely evening. Just then, I heard Youmei's voice downstairs. She said, "You have already seen Mrs. Jiang off. You brought me here and went back, so you have finished your errand. Why are you still following me?" Then I heard a woman answer, "I want to go upstairs to pay my respects to Miss Jiang." Menglan greeted them at the door of her room, leaning against the railing, and smiled down, "You are a woman of your word. You said you would come, and you came." As she spoke, she noticed a maid behind her. She smiled and said, "Mei, do you still need someone to tie you up to bring you here?" The maid stepped forward and raised her head to the upper floor, saying, "Miss Jiang, our mistress said that our young lady is bothering you here. Please don't be too polite." Menglan laughed at her, "Alright, hand her over to me. You can go back." The maid smiled and really left. Youmei came upstairs, first shook Menglan's hand and whispered, "Look, the children of every family are worried about and controlled by their parents like this!" Menglan nodded. Then the two of them sat together at the table, separated by a white porcelain kerosene lamp, looking at each other. Little Ju'er brought chrysanthemum tea and placed four plates of dried snacks on the table. Youmei laughed, "It's like you knew I was coming and prepared these things for guests." Menglan laughed, "Because your credibility in front of me is very good, I knew you would come. I didn't need to expect you." Little Ju, go downstairs. Little Ju stood firmly by the door, staring blankly at the two of them, then laughed, "Miss doesn't call me, I won't come up, okay?" (96)</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Inside Story of Japan's Bid for the Next World Games Location <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Yifa</p>
<p>The 12th World Games has been decided to be held in Tokyo, Japan, and the citizens of Tokyo are all dreaming of the prosperous scene during the Games. This is the first time that the World Games will be held in the East. The reason why it was decided to be held in the East is not because Japan's sporting achievements are so excellent, but because the attention of Europe and the United States is focused on the East due to international relations. On the one hand, Japan has also worked very hard on the activities to determine the location of the World Games. Our country, which is rapidly building new infrastructure, may one day have the World Games decided to be held at the foot of Zijin Mountain in Nanjing. Do not let Japan have all the glory.</p>
<p>Japan's activities to bid for the World Games location started as early as seven years ago. The President of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Mr. Edström, traveled to Japan. He is Swedish. At the welcome banquet of the Japan Student Athletic Association, a student suddenly spoke and asked, "Will the World Games be held in Tokyo?" "Nothing is impossible. As long as you submit a request to the committee and add procedural intervention," the President said. It happened to coincide with the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the country. Therefore, this (Tokyo World Games bid) was passed in the city council. In addition to sending councilors to Europe to campaign, they also asked ambassadors from various countries for assistance.</p>
<p>During the Lausanne Conference, Japan sent five officials to investigate and communicate with the World Games Committee, formally submitting a request. They also printed many photo propaganda materials and sent them to the committee members of various countries. Last year, the World Games Committee met in Via Sello. At that time, Tokyo was also determined to be one of the candidate cities. There were more than ten cities that requested, with Tokyo and Rome being the most promising. Later, Italy voluntarily withdrew due to financial difficulties, but a new force from Finland was added. On Finland's propaganda materials, each statistical country book was based on the proportion of population income to the World Games score. Finland's highest was 3.7, and Japan was at the bottom, with only 0.5. It was said that "Japan's sports world has not yet been enlightened, and Tokyo is of course not qualified to hold the Games." The Japanese were extremely embarrassed when they saw it.</p>
<p>This year, the President of the World Games, Mr. Berg, was brought to Japan by the Japanese for a trip. The World Games Preparation Committee was openly organized by Texas and made every effort to win him over. Ten days before the vote, Tokyo and London had equal hopes. Its success was entirely due to the help of Mr. Berg. When Mr. Berg was in Japan, he had already seen the design drawings of the next Games venue prepared by Japan and thought that Japan was actively preparing. Who knew that these were specially made for Mr. Berg to watch. Now that the World Games have been decided in Japan, there is still no definite construction plan. The newspaper propaganda is just a blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Japan's expenses for bidding for the World Games location from 1932 to the present have cost 480,000 yuan. This time, inviting Mr. Berg to Japan cost 45,000 yuan in hospitality expenses. The publicity fees, communication fees, and entertainment fees in Berlin were about 60,000 yuan. From this point of view, it is so difficult to compete for a World Games location.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Puppet Troops Attack Northern Suiyuan <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>According to yesterday's newspaper, the puppet troops under Zhang Haipeng invaded westward from Chengde, and 3,000 troops under Bao Yueqing were also transferred from Western Rehe. It is said that the various units are using Bailingmiao as a gathering center and then advancing towards Eastern and Northern Suiyuan. Furthermore, the puppet cavalry in Northern Chahar has already begun to attack Northern Suiyuan. It is reported that Fu Zuoyi convened a military conference in Guihua to make proper arrangements for the defense of Northern Suiyuan. They are currently in a stalemate. Their westward policy and desire to invade Eastern and Northern Suiyuan have been long-standing. Therefore, the urgent news from Suiyuan has been flying in like snowflakes in recent days. However, today the situation is even more tense. The so-called two armies in a stalemate is just like in old novels, when the two armies face each other, and a general comes out from the opening of the flag gate. This is such an urgent situation.</p>
<p>The outcome of this war is something to be seen in the next episode. But we always know the importance of Chahar and Suiyuan. Chahar and Suiyuan are areas with abundant natural resources and also serve as a barrier for the northern provinces. Because the current so-called Great Wall can no longer serve as a dangerous fortress, if Chahar and Suiyuan are lost, the so-called Great Wall will be shared with the enemy. I am not clear about the current situation in Chahar. Now I only see the urgent news from Suiyuan. If Suiyuan cannot be defended, then the provinces within the Great Wall will be in danger. We must not despise Suiyuan just because it is far outside the Great Wall.</p>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the unofficial preparatory negotiations between China and Japan in recent days are no less important than the official diplomatic negotiations. Gao Zongwu and Suma will hold another unofficial meeting tomorrow to seek compromises on the points where China and Japan cannot agree. Originally, most things in the world can be discussed. But suppose A and B are discussing something, and A says, "Please open your heart and give it to me," or "Please dissect a certain part of your body and give it to me." No matter how accommodating B is, he will never allow it, right? Pingjin is our heart, and Chahar and Suiyuan are our limbs. How can we give even an inch of land or a iota of sovereignty to others? This is something that cannot be agreed to by any method of intimidation or deception.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to believe that no matter how long the Sino-Japanese negotiations last, it will be difficult to achieve a satisfactory result. I am not hoping for a breakdown in the negotiations between the two sides, because based on factual observation, there is really no possibility of compromise between the two sides. Moreover, while one side is negotiating, the news of the puppet troops attacking westward and advancing towards Northern Suiyuan has been repeatedly reported. This kind of action completely indicates a desire not to resolve the issue peacefully. We believe that the Suiyuan authorities must have a satisfactory response, and the central authorities must also have a way to deal with the aftermath properly and not regard it as an ordinary foreign disaster. Therefore, if we want to see whether the Sino-Japanese negotiations can be resolved, we must first see whether the actions of the puppet troops in Suiyuan can be stopped.</p>

<p>— Linna</p>
<p>Almost every day, at a certain fixed time, we can see him, a tobacco seller carrying a large leather suitcase and holding ten or so new tobacco pipes, silently striding into the store, putting the leather suitcase of tobacco on the glass counter, reaching out to wipe the sweat from his face; then he asks in a low voice: "Boss, do you want tobacco today?"</p>
<p>We immediately go to check the tobacco box, and then reply: "Half a catty - that's it: don't need anymore, that's all."</p>
<p>And he will silently carry his suitcase, walk out of the store, and go to the next one, walking away.</p>
<p>This guy is from Yongchun. I've known him for almost a year or more. He is very quiet, doesn't joke, and doesn't say extra words. On his tall body, apart from that set of sky-blue linen short clothes and pants, a bamboo pointed hat on his head, a bamboo hat removed which reveals a black braid coiled up like cow dung, bare feet with a pair of multi-eared straw sandals, we haven't seen him dress up in any other way. Even during the fervent Christmas, New Year's, he is like this, the only difference is sitting at home smoking a dry pipe!</p>
<p>"He is a monster!" Almost all the merchants who have dealings with him think this way. Imperceptibly, he has gradually attracted attention, and is regarded as a symbol of mystery.</p>
<p>One day, we were made uneasy by a strange piece of news, the news came from a Cantonese peddler. He reported to everyone that this Yongchun man already has a beautiful Tangshan wife in Manila, who was brought there by one of his cousins ​​last year, and he also runs a tobacco shop in Insular, managed by this woman. After speaking, he blinked his small eyes, and waved his hands, depicting. This not only made us begin to pay great attention to this Yongchun man, but also felt very interested: so, whenever he came to our store to peddle tobacco, we often asked with a smile:</p>
<p>"Yongchun man, I heard that here, you have a Tangshan wife?"</p>
<p>He blushed, and silently stared at everyone, as if saying: Why do you want to mind these idle affairs?</p>
<p>"Very beautiful, everyone says so."</p>
<p>He didn't answer a word, as if he had been insulted, picked up his suitcase, and silently strode out of the store again. However, when he came the next day, he would be like nothing had happened: "Boss, do you want tobacco today?"</p>
<p>One day, in the afternoon, I was sent out by the store to collect debts, and I met him by the Male Bridge. He had sold all his goods and was just about to go home. I waved to him from afar, and quickly took a few steps to catch up with him. "Sold out?" I asked in a low voice. "Going home!" he said without even looking at me, his face still low to the ground.</p>
<p>"Where is your home?"</p>
<p>"Insular, there's the shop I opened." I thought to myself: "Why not go with him to see?" So I changed my tone and asked: "Can I go with you?"</p>
<p>He raised his head for the first time, looking at me, as if still a little uneasy. Seeing that I had no malice, or the appearance of mocking him, he silently nodded and said quietly: "I am very happy!"</p>
<p>We didn't say anything, quietly went around the city park, turned the corner of the Poler waste ground, and walked along a dark little street.</p>
<p>This street is almost built outside the city, desolate and lonely. On both sides of the street are squeezed dozens of old zinc houses, some are used as residences, some are used as small shops, in Manila, this is designated as a residential area for the poor, the types and population are equally numerous and complex, there are Spaniards, there are Japanese, there are Chinese and local aborigines.</p>
<p>Next to a wooden bridge that crosses a turbid mud river, there is a small zinc house, and there is a horizontal signboard on the roof that extends over half the street, with five large Chinese characters written in crooked characters "Zhengxing Tobacco Shop", below is a line of English, also written in the same clumsy style, we were on the slope on this side of the bridge, he pointed to the sign from afar, telling me:</p>
<p>"See? That's the tobacco shop I opened."</p>
<p>We slowly walked towards the slope under the bridge, to the point where we could see the street on the other side of the bridge. Suddenly I was absorbed by a chaotic scene, there, there was a group of children standing outside the tobacco shop, raising their two small arms, and throwing the sand and soil in their hands into the shop. From the shop came a burst of scolding. A young woman, with a high bun tied on her head, wearing a set of black jackets on the upper and lower body, holding a dry tobacco pipe in her hand, ran out in great strides, the children were frightened and scattered, clapping their hands and shouting:</p>
<p>"Look, the little-footed China woman..."</p>
<p>This made me think of it, and began to pay attention, yes, she is little-footed, wearing a pair of embroidered shoes, but, she acts as self-assured as an ordinary person, waving the weapon in her hand, laughing and chasing away those little devils.</p>
<p>When we entered the shop, the Yongchun man put down the suitcase on his back, those little devils had all hidden in a fence, she also turned back as if nothing had happened, and laughed without a bit of girlishness:</p>
<p>"These little devils, shout every day: look at the little feet of Chinese women! When they really run out to show them, they all run away one by one..."</p>
<p>Her bold attitude deeply shocked me.</p>

<p>— Bozi</p>
<p>Today, I have come to the countryside again.</p>
<p>I wish there were a few beautiful moonlit nights, so that Dengdi and I could go to the threshing ground to listen to the sounds of frogs, the sounds of snake birds, the sounds of rushing water on the threshing ground. So that Dengdi and I could go to the threshing ground to see the moon, the village in the moonlight, the huge field in front of the village, and see the small wind blowing ripples across the water seedlings in the field. I walked along, making these dreams. My wife slowly lagged behind, with the nanny: she seemed tired, always staggering like that. We walked past the ping, we went around the bay, we passed through one village after another.</p>
<p>The road drew familiar curves in my memory, and the undulating, distant mountains also seemed to have been drawn by my hand.</p>
<p>A light breeze was on our hair, on our clothes, and on the waves over there, a light breeze, in gusts. So, my childhood memories slowly came: I stepped into childhood -</p>
<p>Everything is the same, even though it is a very, very small reed. We, bare-shouldered and back, often walked this road, clothes tied on the top of the head, as a shield from the sun.</p>
<p>"Children, aren't you afraid of drowning?"</p>
<p>One day, Uncle Milong met us, that hunchbacked old man who disgusts us, he knew that we were going to Jiyu Pool to swim and play.</p>
<p>"We won't!"</p>
<p>My companions and I answered him in unison; but that time, Dengdi was indeed in a bit of danger, at that time, Dengdi was not qualified to play in the water with us!</p>
<p>As soon as we finished washing, we started to pick a reed on this road, pulling out the thin reed stems one by one from a leaf, and taking them back to use as arrows for tomorrow's battle. This road was our paradise in the past! Thinking about it, it's like yesterday, can be counted vividly.</p>
<p>But now it is September after the private harvest, Dengdi's wedding date, I heard, is at the end of this October, in the blink of an eye, this child is almost an adult!</p>
<p>I was a little dazed.</p>
<p>I stared at the stream over there, a stream with rippled water blown by the wind - a shallow stream. I slowed down.</p>
<p>Turning a wooden bridge, I saw the oil mill hiding under the maple tree, from the oil mill to Wanjiana, only as far as a pipe of tobacco, I still remember when I was a child, I often played chess under the roots of this tree with kids of the same age, if something went wrong, we would start cursing each other, scolding a bunch of wild words, and disbanding. Now, where have those guys who liked to curse gone? They have probably all grown up, right? Not enough to have a decisive argument for a game of "Nine Sons", right? So I asked my wife:</p>
<p>"Do you still remember Man Niu?"</p>
<p>"He is our tenant farmer."</p>
<p>"Do you still remember Hei Gou?"</p>
<p>"He is our tenant farmer."</p>
<p>"Wangsheng?"</p>
<p>"Also."</p>
<p>Tenant farmers? I thought. I almost didn't believe my wife, how could things be so different in just seven or eight years, I was a little suspicious.</p>
<p>Thinking of the past, I told my wife the story of washing, the story of picking reeds to use as arrows, and the story of always quarreling while playing chess. Tell my wife? I was worried that my wife wouldn't understand.</p>
<p>My wife followed behind, and I could hear a bit of panting.</p>
<p>We were on the road - in front of the oil mill, under our feet was a small stream, there were women washing clothes by the stream, and when they found us, they giggled and laughed from afar.</p>
<p>That is my grandmother's house, emerging above the bamboo forest, that lonely roof.</p>
<p>I turned my head and said to my wife: "We are almost at grandma's house!"</p>
<p>For the first time, I learned to say like my son: my wife just smiled, shyly.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Shepherdess <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Hao Lin</p>
<p>Whenever someone mentions the shepherdess Li Sha, people can't help but sigh.</p>
<p>It really is a tragic destiny. It was only two years ago that Li Sha was a happy person, and she was the most beautiful of all the girls, with a strong body and lively youth. What made her most proud was her Gilbert Lai (Note 1). Which girl in the mountains didn't envy her such happiness?</p>
<p>Gilbert Lai was Li Sha's lover. He wasn't actually called by that name; it was a nickname given by her female companions. His real name was Sabuqi.</p>
<p>During a certain festival's competition, they were both selected to join the singing team. During the competition, the clear and resounding songs of these two people were captivating to the attendees, and it's likely that even Ayi (Note 2) was mesmerized. Therefore, Sabuqi from the male group and Li Sha from the female group were instantly known to everyone. They also met at this time.</p>
<p>Sabuqi lived on the mountain across the river, but this didn't hinder them much. Every day, he would paddle a small canoe across to this side. Li Sha, standing on the high cliff, would excitedly run down to greet him as soon as she saw Sabuqi's canoe paddling to the shore, neglecting her own sheep, only caring about being with him.</p>
<p>In the depths of the forest, there were often traces of this pair. People who passed by them would always hear the innocent laughter of the two, as happy as little birds in the trees, seemingly unaware of what sorrow was in their lives. Sometimes, when they were happy, they would sing at the top of their lungs, their songs melodious, even the thickets in the forest listening in silence. I remember one late night when the bright moon shone high in the sky, people gathered by the forest, chatting idly, the night sound very clear and serene, and everyone savoring it. Suddenly, a song came from the forest:</p>
<p>O maiden, you are the queen of women,</p>
<p>Your bright and kind eyes,</p>
<p>Like the stars in the June night sky,</p>
<p>Shine brilliantly,</p>
<p>Illuminating my subtle steps in the forest,</p>
<p>My beautiful deer,</p>
<p>Let me capture you,</p>
<p>Then a girl continued singing:</p>
<p>Brave hunter,</p>
<p>Come closer to my side,</p>
<p>Never leave,</p>
<p>I will nourish you with the pure milk of my heart:</p>
<p>Climb the high mountain,</p>
<p>Where ten thousand trees provide shelter, we will dwell there.</p>
<p>Anyone would be melted by this song, almost suspecting that it was Theocritus and his Loreidathu out for a night tour (Note 3), but everyone knew that it was Sabuqi and Li Sha singing in harmony.</p>
<p>Time passed, and they continued to love each other passionately.</p>
<p>One day, Sabuqi was crossing the river in the evening, and Li Sha was already standing on the cliff waiting. The weather that day was very bad, with dark clouds and a relentless wind blowing, the waves in the river rolled high like mountains, and there was heavy rain. Li Sha, standing on the cliff, was soaked through, but she didn't move an inch. Her flock of sheep was driven by the heavy rain, and they all scattered and ran into the forest. She seemed to see Sabuqi's small canoe breaking through the waves on the hazy river surface. The sky gradually darkened, and he still hadn't come over. Li Sha continued to watch foolishly. Eventually, her brother came and pulled her back. All night, Li Sha tossed and turned on her pillow, unable to sleep, faintly hearing Sabuqi's cries sadly echoing in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>The night passed, and the sun cheerfully revealed its face as before. A broken canoe drifted on the riverbank. People recognized it as Sabuqi's, and his hunting rifle was still lying in the canoe.</p>
<p>Li Sha went mad from then on. Every day, she would stand on the cliff where she used to wait for Sabuqi to come over, crying. If it was a windy and rainy day, her wails were truly miserable, and anyone who heard them would shed tears.</p>
<p>(Note 1) The male god of love in ancient Oroqen mythology, used here as a lover.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Ayi, a benevolent god in Shamanism.</p>
<p>(Note 3) Two gods, male and female, who were good at singing. Legend has it that they often came out to sing late at night.</p>

<p>— Liu Gongdao</p>
<p>Every time I walk past that newly built Western-style house, I miss the wooden bridge that was torn down.</p>
<p>The original site of that house was a small stream. Because the riverbed was too high, the water only flowed slowly from the gaps in the rocks when the tide rose in the outer river. I would stand on the wooden bridge and watch it twist and turn like a swimming dragon, all the way past the bridge foot and under the wooden posts of a house, to a place I couldn't see. When the tide receded, it would flow back from under the wooden posts, along the original path to the outer river. However, it became so swift and angry, rushing against the rocks that obstructed its path, making a clanging roar like a charging cavalry.</p>
<p>Every day, I stood on the bridgehead, silently facing it as if meeting a lover. I had a dream, a dream of a young girl: she died in this stream.</p>
<p>The young girl had a pair of charming dark eyes, and she also appeared at the bridgehead every day to wash clothes by the river. When I saw her, her black braid was already tied with white yarn. Yes, a lonely child, she desperately needed a man who understood romance to love her, but the man she was in love with had a cowardly heart, and he dared not look directly into her charming dark eyes. She felt disappointed. On a gentle spring evening, like the stream at low tide, she rushed breathlessly into the man's arms in the dark night.</p>
<p>The man bore her a daughter, a girl who couldn't be seen, so she was taken away by the stream, because the man had no way to deal with her…</p>
<p>I still stood on the wooden bridge every day…</p>
<p>The water flowed back and forth every day, damaging the wooden posts of that house. They bought the small river, demolished the bridge, filled the riverbed, and a new Western-style house was built adjacent to the old house.</p>
<p>…So I lost the place I lingered every day!</p>
<p>The mistress of the Western-style house understands music. She plays the piano every day, her music plaintive and weeping, probably because she doesn't know that a romantic young girl is buried under the house?</p>
<p>Every time I walk past her door, I miss the wooden bridge that was torn down.</p>
<p>I want to chase my dream…</p>

<p>Opening "Wine Immortal"</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a celestial descended on Western Sichuan. The star Chang Geng entered his dream and produced many kidneys. His talent was boundless and strange in all directions. He would drink a斗 of wine and madly compose a hundred poems. Because he could recognize foreign languages, his fame spread throughout the world. When summoned by the emperor, he often delayed. He was still sleeping in a wine shop in the Chang'an marketplace. He had no scruples before the emperor, claiming himself to be the Wine Immortal. The powerful warrior took off his boots, and the favored concubine ground ink for him. He composed three Qingping tunes and added them to the pear garden for pipes and strings to play. He was赐ed a glass of grape wine, and his rabbit hair brush fell on the paper, dyeing the clouds with smoke. Because of a new makeup line in Fei Yan, Lady Yang mistakenly believed the public opinion. Later, he took off his hat and resigned, wandering the world for more than ten years. An imperial edict descended from the sky, and money for wine was collected from all government offices. He went to Caishiji to capture the moon riding a whale. Ancient heroes are hard to compare. Who doesn't know Li Qinglian?</p>

Suddenly, they see a powerful rogue. The servants snatch the beautiful prostitutes. It is said to be the son of Zhang Delong. The righteous heroes are furious and never stop. They all embrace injustice and come to the rescue together. The evil servants and the bad masters form a deep hatred. At that time, the prostitute was favored. She was reluctant to go to Liuchun Courtyard. Zhou Quan examines Mao Long Fei. The Eastern Road is unsuccessful, so you don’t have to worry. The shy journey is long. It is difficult to go to the imperial capital. They said goodbye at the Willow Pavilion. Their sleeves moved each other, and their tears flowed. From then on, it will be difficult to meet again. The hero goes home to plot. The barrier of Yin and Yang makes the two places sad.</p>

<p>Opening "Palace Complaint"</p>
<p>The West Palace is quiet at night, with a hundred flowers fragrant. I want to roll up the bead curtains, but my spring hatred is long. The beloved concubine sits alone on a agarwood bed, burning a red candle and waiting for the king. Gao Lishi, start the concubine. Tonight, the emperor is in Zhaoyang. Tai Zhen heard that she was more sad and languid, so she took off her palace makeup. She fell asleep in her clothes on the mandarin duck quilt, seeing a round of bright moon shining on the palace wall. A lonely cold pillow sleeps sadly. The陣 array of sour tears flow down my face. I advise people not to accompany the king. Accompanying him is like accompanying a tiger. I wonder what kind of appearance the empress has. Why did you abandon me? It's better to marry a romantic son and enjoy the joy of the morning and the evening. The crape myrtle flower faces the crape myrtle man.</p>

<h3 id="e243">The Life Story of Sai Jinhua <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Who doesn't know Sai Jinhua, who is famous throughout the world? She is the wife of Hong Wenqing, the envoy to the four countries of Russia, Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. When Hong Wenqing was an envoy, she followed him around the world. In Germany, she was honorably summoned to the palace by Empress Feili every other day to talk. Of course, it goes without saying that at international banquets, she was the most popular and often surrounded by young officers.</p>
<p>Later, Hong Qianchai returned to China, and died a few years later. Sai Jinhua's fate began to show a bleak future day by day.</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua, the widow, had not been there for two months when Mrs. Hong asked two senior officials to talk to her and asked her if she was willing to remain a widow. Sai Jinhua was a very straightforward person, and she honestly asked Mrs. Hong to let her go. The reason was that she was born with a temperament that loved to be lively. Hong Wenqing was dead, and no one was controlling her. She couldn't keep it herself. If she insisted on keeping it, she was afraid that there would be bad rumors. It would really be sorry for Hong Wenzhuan. She wouldn't pretend to deceive people and deceive herself. It was better to leave directly, no matter what happened, it had nothing to do with the Hong family. Moreover, she was only in her twenties at that time, and she was afraid of dying. Why should she defend herself? Where can I keep it!</p>
<p>At that time, three conditions were agreed upon: first, she was not allowed to go to the capital in the short term, as there were too many acquaintances there; second, she was not allowed to flaunt the names of Fu Caiyun and Meng Dai in the future; third, except for the 50,000 yuan in the will and the jewelry and clothes, she was not allowed to demand anything from the Hong family. Under these three conditions, she left the Hong family.</p>
<p>However, she did not receive a penny of the 50,000 yuan in Hong Jiawenqing's will, and it was all swallowed by a young nephew of the Hong family. Later, her life gradually became difficult.</p>
<p>Six years later, in Jiangnan and Pingjin, people were spreading the word about Sai Jinhua, a beautiful woman. This was because she changed her original name to Sai Jinhua in order to fulfill the treaty.</p>
<p>Once, the old lady of Li Shan, the Minister of Household Affairs and concurrently the Deputy of Beiyang Military Affairs, had a birthday. Sai Jinhua rushed to Tianjin to join in the fun. In that carnival of the Li Mansion, Sai Jinhua and Shi Yufang, a servant, became sworn brothers and called each other brothers. And she moved the team from Tianjin to Beijing. This was the time when the Yihe Fist was causing a stir in Tianjin and Beijing. (To be continued)</p>
