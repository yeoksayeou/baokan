<h3>孫中山先生逝世紀念</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>孫中山先生死了十一年了他是我全國同胞最所敬愛的革命家他的偉大的精神他對於中華民族的不朽的功蹟使我們在今天的紀念日不得不深深的來追念一番中山先生爲革命苦幹了一生差不多可以說大會享受過一天的安樂然而這種苦幹精神終於在他身後收到極大的效果了他不但成了中國的偉人還成了全世界的偉人他那甚至戚應到全世界的精深博大的革命思想是兩種成分所構成的第一就是大公無私的博愛精神以及從這根苗滋長的那一種堅强的對於帝國主義和封建勢力的敵視心理第二就是對於中國和世界的局勢的最深廣的見識這不消說是他憑着卓越的天才從不倦的研究得來的</p>
<p>中山先生初期的思想和努力推翻了滿淸政府創造了中華民國然而民國成立以後這位偉大的革命家却就感到失望了他繼續爲革命努力着研究着終於產生了我民族的寳典三民主義和建國方略這兩種奠定現在中國政治基礎的著作雖然直到他的晚年方才發表然而其中的精髓却在民國初年早就有了胚胎當時的中國民族不過從第一决革命得到了一部分的解放却又受着北洋軍閥和帝國主義加深的壓迫了民國三四年間日本乘着歐戰的機會實行起牠那可怕的大陸政策來牠佔領了靑島和膠濟鐵路進一步用武力壓迫着中國要我們承認二十一條件中山先生當時把國際情勢和中國民族的出路認識得再透澈也沒有了四年三月他便在對中華革命黨的通吿上說「急持革命中義一致進行然後安內攘外之實可以言也吾人但卽前事以爲例證往者滿淸季年旅大膠廣以决刲割揚子江東三省福建雲南兩廣指爲外人勢力範圍大之無識者鮮不曰不可革命革命卽召瓜分吾人乃力排之排之而勝革命思潮日益膨脹革命驟至各國乃坐視而不敢動繼此數年革命黨人所在執持政柄者外人皆不敢輕侮……可知能用眞正之民氣扞衛國家者惟吾黨爲能袁氐事事襲滿淸之故智則外交上安得不蹈滿淸之後塵故革命正以救亡並非空論」</p>
<p>中山先生後來所發表的具體的主義和政綱不消說就是這種基本的革命理論的闡揚國民革命的進展以及最後北伐的完成不消說就是中山先生和他的信奉者用這種理論始終不懈地激發着民氣的結果</p>
<p>今天中山先生的逝世紀念日我們所以特別摘出他通吿上那幾句話來就因爲今日國際情勢下中國所處的地位正跟歐戰時期有幾分近似日本的大陸政策經過了英美勢力一時期的阻遏從九一八事變以來又復抬頭了現在大戰雖還沒有發動但是潛伏的危機已經使列强都自顧不暇了這一種國際情勢顯然刺戟着日本軍人對於中國的加深的野心同歐戰時期沒有什麼兩樣我們面對着這麼嚴重的國家的憂患禁不住感覺到中山先生精確不移的「革命救亡」的主張還有待于用最大的努力來貫徹我們知道中山先生不但是一位大政治家更重要的他還是一位大革命家他說過他所創造的國民黨並不是政黨實在是革命黨我們又知道革命還有着比獲得政權更大的目標到如今遠沒有達到然而我們現在却有一點可以安慰的就是我們的政府遠非袁世凱時代可比了我們的政府領袖都抱着繼承中山先生遺志的决心他們該不至於忘掉中山先生的「革命尙未成功」這一句警語在應付國難的時候他們當然也會牢守中山先生的最後一番遺言的</p>
<h3>英下院辯論兩日　國防白皮書卒通過　財相稱經費籌劃不成問題　邱吉爾祥述德國備戰狀况</h3>
<p>倫敦今日下院繼續辯論國防白皮書、其討論集中點爲德國軍備之恢復、結果、下院在以三七八票對一五五票吾决工黨修正案後、以三七一票對一五三票通過國防白皮書、</p>
<p>財相張伯倫在表决前發結束言論、證實羅卡諾公的簽字國與國聯行政院皆將在倫敦開會、並宣佈十三國委員會本定於三月十一日集議於日內瓦、現已展期至下星期、張伯倫稱、上星期杪之事件、已證實白皮書所載時局並非固定、辦法有隨時變更的必要之言論、或有謂英政府對於集體安全僅有口惠者、實則不然、集體安全已使英國費去七百萬鎊、今猶每月因此支付五十萬鎊左右、如下院决定政府所擬辦法爲安全、及履行國聯盟的義務爲必要、則國家定能籌此經費不成問題云、</p>
<p>辯論時、邱吉爾發言、其言頗長、專述德國狀况、其言曰、德政府縱極嗜好和平、然其所處者、爲進退維谷之境、前進則破產堪虞、中止則失業必增、德政府於此、不久將趨於下述兩途之一、卽內訌或外患是也、德之首腦其將趨於何途、吾人能無疑乎、吾人聞德國尙未準備戰爭、亦有謂德國僅半準備者、然吾人目覩歐洲國家之不憚戰爭者、僅德國耳、爲過去數日中吾人所見者爲半武裝的德國形式、試思其絕大準備漸臻完畢時、時局又將如何耶、戰爭往往不待至各戰鬥者悉已準備後而始發作、余恐歐洲軍備史終將有達於極點之一日、余雖不能斷定其在何日、然確信在本屆國會時期中此日必至、此日或可安然過去、吾人其勿接受戰爭必不可免之理論、然亦不可對於時事之殘酷的進行、閉目無覩、余前曾謂德國直接或間接在一九三五年用於軍備者達三萬萬鎊以上、余有金融統計、可表示德國如何從其金融家秘密覓得此欵、在希特勒秉政後之三年中、德國共用一萬五千萬鎊、此欵借自國內、其財源早已抵押、甚有預借四年者、假定其數僅爲六千萬鎊、吾人亦須遭遇影響不可計算之事件、德國數百萬人從前失業者、已在軍械製造廠中覓得工作、或已入伍服役矣、</p>
<p>其財政情形、現已達於不能長此進行之程度、德國空軍現仍駕英國而上之、英國允當多置驅逐艦隊、以抵防潛艇危害云、據邱吉爾之意、白皮書所載之計畫尙嫌不充分、渠以德國工業方面之準備與英國相較、主張英政府應創設單獨軍火部、白皮書中所稱常備軍與領士軍不能同時改善設備之說、可爲英國工業尙未整頓以與時局相適之明證、</p>
<p>前相喬治發言、對於驅逐艦隊之一重要、渠與邱吉爾同意、但不贊成邱吉爾對於德國軍力之估計、其言曰、吾人現非無國防者、海軍無敵、苟採行適當方法、吾人尙可得其他方面同樣正確之保護、德國與一九一四年相較、現無與國、余意德國不致作愚莽行爲、而與集體安全所組合之軍力相抗、故德國提議二十五年不侵略公的、余信其言云、</p>
<p>內相西門亦發言論、謂英帝國國防委員會以首相爲主席、附有若干小組會、而參謀長委員會卽其一也、此係平時制度、在平時行使職務　屬柑宜、但在吾人現所遭過之時代中、則此種制度、實有增厚其力量擴大其範圍之必要、今日吾人所遇者、爲更困難之緊急時代、設不幸一旦戰事發生、則吾人必須有更聯絡不斷的接觸與更迅速的合作、如白皮書中之辦法、爲國會所贊同、　極重要工作上之非常困難、卽可迅速掃除、時局須有始終不懈的注意、依政府之意見、辦理國防事宜之機關、現須有若干擴張、政府斷定最好辦法、在設立專員、以帝國國防委員會專任主席之資格行使特殊大權、以辦理白皮書中所載之重要職務云、（十日路透電）</p>

<h3>日本注視　歐局今後推移　對德行動似表同情</h3>
<p>東京關於德國廢除羅卡諾條的之行動、外務省已於十一日接到駐英法德意各大使之報吿、均指摘此事之嚴重性、據稱德軍進佔非武裝區域之萊茵地帶、係以法蘇互助條約爲其直接原因、但日本雖屬參加凡爾賽條約之一員、而於羅卡諾協定未曾加入、無論任何關係國當不至要求日本援助、唯日本政府認爲法蘇互助條約僅限於歐洲、而與遠東方面無關、雖曾聲明此意、然蘇聯最近之言行對日採取攻勢、頗有監視牽制之態度、故德國此决行動雖未任何說明、而其事態之推移則至堪注意也、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>阿京西北一重鎭　遭意空軍炸毀　投彈如雨歷一時餘　死傷一百四十餘人</h3>
<p>阿京　阿國戈姜省都會台白拉瑪柯斯、距阿京西北一百二十哩、今日爲意飛機炸毀、據此間所接可恃消息、意機轟炸極爲猛烈、爲開戰以來所僅見、死平民五十八人、傷八十五人、意機從事轟炸者計有十二架、炸彈紛落如雨歷一時餘、迨該城房屋幾皆成灰燼時、意機始飛去、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>阿斯瑪拉　外間雖喧傳意國因德國廢的之行動而有戒心、將避免在阿之大規模戰事、但北路陣錢全部之陸軍與空軍攻勢、現仍在進行中、聞意軍希望與阿王親統之大軍决一勝負、蓋阿國唯此軍能作眞正之大戰鬥也、（十一日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓提出建築陸軍飛機根據地之威爾可斯、今日聲稱、我人必須於本年以內建築三個空軍根據地、其一當在米亞密、其二當在阿拉斯加、其三當在鄧佛、並謂太平洋上某一强國、已有奪取阿拉斯加與巴拿馬之計劃也、除此以外、威氏提案中更附有可以稍緩建築之空軍根據地六處、並附有陸軍部所建議之地點、衆院政費委員會某委員派克氏聲稱、彼擬於本夏赴阿拉斯加、藉便研究該地之防空問題、據謂陸軍方面之防空計劃、與海軍方面之計劃、頗能不謀而合云、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>南京二六變案發生後宣佈之戒嚴令、似將維持至本月杪、大的因當局仍在搜捕被疑參與該案之文員所致、此類文員被拘者迄今共有一百五十人、刻在研訊中、各行政省各公署及各要點、現仍有兵隊守衛、惟京中之一切尋常活動、絕對未受妨碍、同時據官報宜佈、與亂之軍官已於三月五日由軍法裁判處開審、三月二十八日因在帝國旅社出言不愼被拘之英國新聞家兼著作家桑浦森、當局控以犯向旅客宣傳反對戒嚴法之罪、現仍在羈禁中、大的須至戒嚴令取銷後、始能釋出、英領事雖竭力爲之緩頰、但格於戒嚴令不能生效、（十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>國聯易地開會　歐局重心移倫敦　羅卡諾簽字國今日再集議　法堅持國際條約須受尊重</h3>
<p>巴黎昨晚洛迦諾公的簽字國代表在法外交部舉行第二决集議、自七時四十分起、至八時十二分止、散會後、據公布、已决定羅卡諾公的簽字國代表於星期四日在倫敦繼續開會、國聯行政院則於星期六日亦在倫敦開會、故後此數日、倫敦將爲關心歐洲大局者目光集中之點、英外相艾登與掌璽大臣海里發斯將於今晨飛回倫敦、與政府續商各事、聞法國因英國邀請在倫敦討論羅卡諾公的問題、殊爲欣喜、此議出諸艾登與海里發斯、請示於英相包爾溫、其贊同之覆電、適在法外交部第二决集議之前收到、</p>
<p>今晨羅卡諾公的簽字國代表集議之結果、使衆益覺德國行動之嚴重性、聞法國堅主必德國首先撤兵、而後可談判締結不侵略及天空公的、以代羅卡諾公的、甚至作「表徵上」撤退、法國亦所心願、其爲衆特殊注重之點、厥爲比國之安全、繫於非武裝區、甚至猶甚於法、德國責法國與蘇俄締結互助恊定、違反羅卡諾公的、然不能以此責比也、昨日羅卡諾公的簽字國與擔保國代表之集議、皆由法外長佛蘭亭主席、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎聞國聯行政院所以改在倫敦集議者、因英國輿情仍甚鎭靜、故衆信在倫敦開會、必能採助此困難談判也、而倫敦與柏林間之交通、亦較日內瓦與柏林爲便、國聯行政院之在倫敦集議、此爲自一九二二年以還之第一决、此間人士之印象、以爲英國邀請各國代表在倫敦集議者、多由於法外長佛蘭亭比首相齊倫詳陳國聯所遭之問題、及和平之陷於危險、英外相艾登與掌璽大臣海里發斯聞言深爲感動、乃主改在倫敦集議、俾英首相包爾溫與其閣員均得一聆此種議論、而艾登之出此、亦欲避免蹈前外相霍爾在巴黎談話後之覆轍也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>傳法對德表讓步</p>
<p>巴黎今日上午羅卡諾公的國會議、艾登竟獲得其畢生最大之成功、卽使法國作下列二項讓步、　佛蘭亭担保法國對德國不取軍事行動、　法國有條件的保證不再堅持須於德軍撤退之後始能進行關於羅卡諾公的之交涉、關於第二點之條件、卽德國担保不在萊茵河區重設防禦工程、及希特勒修正其重返國聯及天空公的之建議云、（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>倫敦據負責方面消息、法國所能接受之最低限度、爲德國簽定英意擔保之公的、而規定德國不能在萊茵區域建造防禦工程、預料法國將援引一九三五年四月四日國聯之决議案、卽詆責片面吾認契的、而施以經濟財政制裁者、法國現願依賴擔保各國之竭誠援助、其至因此取軍事計畫、亦在所不惜云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎方面之否認</p>
<p>巴黎聞法國現主張如集體安全制所依據之條的證明無效、則擬退出國聯、其他數國已告知法國、亦同具此意惟法國擬首先竭盡洛迦諾公的與國聯盟的所供之一切可能性、以對德兵重佔萊茵一事獲得滿意、報載法國可接受希特勒所提出解决危局之方法、卽萊茵德兵限定人數、萊茵地非武裝區域內不建造防禦工程一節、今日已由法政府發表公報、切實予以吾認、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>意仍未明示態度</p>
<p>羅馬意國昨雖參加法外交部之集議、討論德國破壞羅卡諾公約事、但意國之態度、仍未由當局正式宣佈明白之文告、惟意國之立塲、現爲意報用譏刺英法之論調表示之、如斯丹達報曰、倫敦巴黎現皆談及意國爲羅卡諾公的簽字地之地位、而不知意國現爲彼等所排斥之國、早被置之度外矣云、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國聯行政院會　邀德派員參加</h3>
<p>里賓特洛浦將代表出席　十三委會開會展期</p>
<p>日內瓦國聯秘書廳今日宣布、國聯行政院將於星期六在倫敦開會、並通告原定於星期三舉行之十三國委員會會議、無期展緩、按十三國委員會所擬討論者、爲意阿兩國對於調解東菲戰爭之答覆、消息靈通之觀察者謂、法國堅持國聯暫時擱置意阿爭端、英國已不能拒絕、據悉如德國得在萊茵河區駐兵、則或者亦將耍求在達達尼爾及博斯福魯兩海峽間重設防禦工程、國聯方面聞之颇爲震驚、且對於一般局勢亦甚焦慮、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>日內瓦國聯俞行政院業已决定改於十四日卽星期六日在倫敦開會並向蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫•土耳其外長魯舒第·羅馬尼亞外長蒂社樓斯哥•分頭發出通告、（十一日哈瓦斯　）</p>
<p>倫敦國聯會行政院决於本月十三日舉行會議、討論德國廢的問題之後、曾由國聯會秘書長愛文諾、詢問德國屆時能吾派員出席、關於此事、據柏林方面消息、德國外交部人士主張應卽派員、惟希特勒元首左右堅持異議、大抵德國若果應邀出席、則代表人選、將屬諸前任軍縮問題專使里賓特洛浦、聞里氏對於德國廢止羅卡諾公的之後立卽進兵入萊茵河非武裝區域一舉、事前曾持異議、但未爲希特勒元首所採納云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎據此間可靠方面消息、希特勒决定於今日派里賓特洛浦充其個人全權代表、出席倫敦會議、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>英外相艾登　離巴黎返倫敦　出席定例閣議</h3>
<p>倫敦英外相艾登與掌璽大臣海里發斯、原定今晨乘飛機由巴黎返倫敦、但爲霧阻、故改乘火車回國、內閣今日舉行常會、俟艾登返後、卽將再開會議、此後數日中談判之難點、在如何使法國所提出萊茵德軍不撤則不能談判之方案、與英國主張談判之戚想以調和、英人之在巴黎者、以爲法國態度現漸緩和、星期六日國聯行政院之會議或將請德國參加、但德國出席與吾、殊無把握、因德國自退出國聯後、向抱可能時避免與國聯直接接觸之態度也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>簽約國巴黎會議　未有具體决議　英法見解漸趨接近</h3>
<p>倫敦可靠方面消息、羅卡諾公的簽字國、本日在巴黎舉行會議之際、與會之英法意比四國、僅事交換意見、而無所决定、據消息靈通者所知、法國召集會議之目的、係在覓求可能辦法、俾得另訂新的、代替羅卡諾公的，此在英國則以爲日昨艾登外相曾在下議院切實聲明、法比兩國苟受攻擊、英國自必依照羅卡諾公的所規定出而援助、此項聲明、就法比兩國而言、實係一種充分但保辦法、不必再求其他矣、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎英國負責人士頃向本社訪員發表談話、謂法國對於德國廢止羅卡諾公的問題所抱見地、爲英國所完全了解、報載英法兩國意見參差、實非眞相、又謂英國艾登外相此决前來巴黎、參加羅卡諾公的簽字國會議、其目的僅在探問法國之立塲、而不擬採取何項决定、故一俟探知法國意向之後、卽認爲有返屬報告之必要、俾由英國內閣向法國提出切實答復云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國堅持　先撤兵後談判　英國願以調人自居</h3>
<p>巴黎據外交部人士聲稱、關於德國片面廢的行爲、此際所研究者、厥爲對德制裁之原則、惟制裁辦法、目前尚未討論及之、一般人以爲與德國進行談判、當以德軍退出萊茵河爲先决條伴、至採何種步驟、以達到退出之目的、則惟國聯會行政院、始有决定之權、此際英法兩國見解不同之處、卽德國希特勒元首所提建議能吾予以接受之一點、蓋英國對於德國行動、應予貶斥、雖爲英國所贊成、但該國以爲不妨逕卽考慮與德國進行談判、而不必先行提出撤軍條件、此則法國所期期以爲不可者也、至於此國、雖以爲羅卡諾公約所載互助條欵、務當付諸實施、但其態度、似在英法兩國之間、處於折衷地位、又意大利則因此際不能參加對德制裁、故僅以觀察者之地位自居、關於此層、一般人以爲羅卡諾公約簽字各國合力對德與解决意阿爭端、未可劃爲二事、應使之發生密切關係云、（指意阿爭端、應卽予以解决、俾意國得以參加對德制裁）（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎事業報頃載稱關於羅卡諾公的一案、德國已有讓步之意、英國業向法國提出建議、謂德國若能接受下開各項辦法、則法國不必堅持德軍退出萊茵河區域、卽可與德國開始談判、所謂各項辦法、　卽德國承諾在萊茵省、不設防禦工事、　卽重返國聯會、幷不附帶重要條件、　卽簽訂天空公的、幷附以限制軍備條欵、該報又稱、國聯會行政院會議、現已改在倫敦開會、德國卽將派遣里本特洛浦以觀察員名義、前往該處接洽、英國則爲德國居間調處、冀有以减輕各方面之責難、幷覔求一種方式、俾行政院各會員國均可接受、而以之作爲談判基礎、英國政府以爲國聯會行政院之任務、重在維護安全、自當以息事寗人爲主旨、該報最後又稱、茲據可靠消息、英國前任航空大臣倫敦德里勛爵、上月前往德國參觀奧林匹克冬季運動會、道出柏林氏、曾與希特勒元首相會晤、希特勒當時卽已密語倫敦德里、謂萊茵河沿岸重行設防一事、當於本年三月間見諸實際云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>中國農村衰落的原因（下）</h3>
<p>— 中央大學農學院院長　鄒樹文</p>
<p>此外還有兩穢人禍：一是內戰的起伏，一是匪共的蔓延，自民元以來，養不參沒有一年沒有內戰，每决內戰，總是農民首先遭殃，在戰區以內的農村，自然免不了老弼死於溝壑，強奢鍵而走險，耕作失時，田地荒蕪的應有景象，在戰膩以外的農村，也始因為抽調壯丁，從發糧秣，人昆疲於奔命，不能安居樂業。至於匪共蔓延的膩域，財產被掠，廬舍為墟，造成赤色恐怖，破壞社會安髯，影饗所及，農村自然更陷於水深火然之中了。</p>
<p>總之，我們中國農村衰落的原因，外由帝國主義汝奇捐雜稅你強力的壓迫，內係農村本身的虛弱，更加以天災人禍的影饗，道縫誰也不能吾認的。</p>
<p>惆人所見的農村衰落的原因及其補救方法。</p>
<p>上文所說是一般見到的，我個人對於道租觀點，當然承認，但她微機有點不同的見解。我覺得要對農村衰落謀救濟的方灸，單單羅列幾個不相關聯的原岡，榮不雊的，我們要看淸各娥相荒問的翻係以及對於國外的馴係，我們要看淸農工商一切相亙的關係，以及農民心理的作用，然後才能對症下藥，作複興農村的工作。</p>
<p>各地聞相亙的關係　我們姑艮把令國區城分為黃河以北，長江上游，興長江下游，以及南部沿海各省。黃河以北，與東叫省友內外蒙古新疆均有密切的關係。自從東四省淪陷以後，凡附近各省農民每年跑關東的，失去了很多的機會。縱使有少數前往的人，也不如從前能自由的獲得利益。再就對外蒙古的關係而言，從張庫通商道阻以後，張家口一地的商務，固然有顯著的衰落。因張家口商務寰珞，其影饗各地貨物，也可以想像而知。新疆省是一塊極大的地方，自從西伯利亞鐵路完成以後，對俄國交通愈形便利勿對中國交通愈形不便。以上各地對於木國的鄰地，竟成了異域，木國農村產品和農民遜徙，都缺少了出路，所受損失無從統計，也不必統計，便可以知道共是極大的了。</p>
<p>浙江南部汝福建廣東沿海的人民，紫以能謀海外發展為全國之冠，每年僑民匯回木國的姿金，以數千萬計，近來因全仳界發生經濟恐慌，僑商失敗，各地排蘿苦烈，僑民不但無力隴錢回國，並且往往不能立足於國外。遝舔有形無形的捐失，也趁計算不擺的。</p>
<p>長江下游以及沿海各省，因為對外交通便利的關係，本國貨物圾受外國貨物的威脅，這不能完令歸咎於不平等倏的，同時也她因為本國貨物販運組皺不完全，所以商戰上不能不失敗。長江上游四川一省，物產鱟實，木有無窮貨物可以還銷各處，人民驟買力也非常之大，但以年年內戰，經濟損失不可數計，於楚附近各省受其影饗極大，而靑海康藏在商業上，也絲乎與我本國斷絕了關係。此外陝甘酗馴貴等，交通不便的省分，因匪息內亂，交通更為不便，正當貨物，因笨重不易轉運，惟有雅片量少而價責，故不但軍閥強迫栽觀，而農民亦因自然之趨勢，業起培植罌栗，多一畝鴉片，不但多一畝毒醫，當然，還要減少一畝正當農產。</p>
<p>以上分區並不籠劃然剖分，不過借此表明各區相互的關係，我們要救濟農村，專謀全國經濟的調整。舊式的農產物，自然要謀共依舊暢銷。而因時代的不同，與環境的變遷，對於農村各種生產，允應加以改良並出謀調整供給與需耍的關係，决不能故步自封，可達復興農村之目的。</p>
<p>農工商友一切事物相亙的關係　我會量决為文說明欲救農村？不能祇見農村不見其他，閔為農村與其他各地，息息相關，工業的原料，多數是農產品，允其在重工業不發達的地方，農產品常然佔工業原料的絕對多數。農產品要合州代的鏘用，須有齊一品級的大發供給，我們近幾年來，祇絲與棉花有分級檢綸，然而去理想的推行還是很遠。我們的一切璣產品，都該有一定不可混淆的品級，大飛的供給，才可以合現代工業的應用以及現代商業的販賣。關於商業本身對於雌產品也有一惆極東要的責任。就茫販運本國農產品的商業，不加販運外國農產品之有完備的組識，自然市場上的外國農產品會噸倒木國農產品。</p>
<p>農民技術的不改巡，說過的人巳經不少。我涊為殺不改進的是不能取工業上的發明來應用於農舶朮上。我們常媳見人挽，中國人多，用不蒲棧械，我認為這是一句極荒繆的話，先迆國的農民，每人有一惆將近二十匹馬力的機械使用，一匹馬力可以抵到八惆極強壯的農民，所以一個農民，可以敵得我們一百六十個農民。我們拿美國與俄國農民的人口比較一下，我們的農民俗不礦人家的農民一百六十倍呢？而況一百六十惆自然人消費的食粗比絞二十匹馬力機械的消費彙，大不相同的。我們縱然人多，也不能藉口作不用機械力的遞詞。</p>
<p>自艦民缺乏自信力　從前所謂「帝力於我何有哉」的成語，現在是不適用了。凡是與外界接觸的農民，自然有目力微弱的感想。農民見了外界人，往往發生了類似請求恩賜的行動。譬如他所稱的田荒了，他不知道盡力用耕種的方伐來補救，反而東手悴查荒的先生們來踏勘。唯一的希望，論求免鑷，而不再在請求免親之外，多作一點事悄。又如遇了災害，有人館往救濟，艇民祇有嗽嗽待哺的心理，而缺乏自行振術的工作。粥廠一開，粥廠圳圍的窮人，祇有移家就食，很少川去倣工。這稱靠人而不靠已的心理，在磯荒的時候固然如此，平常也麩如此。軍救農村，應該要農民自救，這種報久的心理麩千萬要不得的。因為選種心理是精卹主農村裂落的原因，我們應該從速用教育的力紫來矯芷選秤心理，吾則，農民無健全的心理去作自救農村的工作卹別人亦救不了農村</p>
<p>總之，中國農村褻落的原肉，極其複雜，各地咨有其榦殊原因，而各原因又各有其相互關係，救濟農村，不楚僅於農村簷眼便能收效，必須從與農村相關的各方面，直接或聞接幾籌並顧，才可達到復興農村的目的，遺趁我個人所貢獻的意見。</p>

<h3>靑海旅行記</h3>
<p>— 莊學本</p>
<p>喜歡旅行的我，二十二年在川邊廓落克游歷了九個月。二十三年回到南方，休息了十一個月；二十四年冬天，我旅行的興趣父活躍起來。</p>
<p>十二月一日護送班禪大師回藏的誠專使，在浦口掛着專車西發；我同時也被這一列車帶到了西安。在西安因爲等汽車的關係，整整躭擱了一個月。</p>
<p>光陰過得很快，我們在二十五年一月十二日又到達了蘭州，專使行署需要在此地籌備入藏的一切所以有一個比較長時期的躭擱，我抽着這個空間打算先進靑海去游歷一决，同時預備考察靑海的土人蒙人藏人的民情風俗，補足上項到了靑海的邊上，而還沒有進入靑海內部的缺憾。</p>
<p>在蘭州住了十天，時間已在陰曆的年底了；舊習未除的西北人民，忙着預備過年。到處的城門口貼着新綏汽車公司「十塊錢送你到靑海去過年，」的招紙。我和願意同我作伴的柯先生受了這紅紙條吸引，便在專使行署告了假，一月二十一日正是陰曆十二月二十六日，登程西行，汽車在塵幕中高山上駛了兩天半，恰巧在陰曆的年夜趕進了靑海的省會西寗城。當夜劈劈拍拍滿城的爆竹聲，似乎在歡迎我們新來的旅客。晚間又下了一陣大雪，「雪兆豐年」，西寗的人們都在快樂中過年。我們的旅行生活從此也就開始。</p>
<p>我們决心去參加熱鬧的土民新年，所以今天雖是舊曆的元旦，我們也不願休息。昨晚我們僱了一輛赴互助縣的轎車，因爲今天是元旦，所以九十里的平路竟索價至十四元，旣而以五元成交。</p>
<p>晨曦照着西寗的城廓，我們坐在轎車向東北的山溝進發，元旦的晨餐：是幾個乾　和着零度以下的西北風咀嚼。車子在湟水的冰上過去，皓潔的曉雪被我們的輪轂軋成兩條長綫。稀疎的村落向山崗上展開。</p>
<p>二十里以後騾車北折，順着紗塘川上溯，枝幹挺秀的白楊樹夾住在路的兩旁，點缀沿途的風景。一路多是漢人的莊房，小脚的女子，穿着花鞋；用黑布兜頭；湖綠色的，妃紅色的，外衣上棍着五色闊邊，吾們切意着土人，但是始終沒有發現他們一個影子。</p>
<p>兩邊山脈盡頭處，發現一片城　建築在高二六七〇公尺的平壩上；這裹是互助縣了。轎車穿着城門進去，城中寂靜無聲，行人稀少，只有幾個小孩在蹋毽子放爆竹，商店的門上貼滿紅紙的春聯，閉得緊緊的。</p>
<p>我們的車子歇在縣政府的門口，縣長馬師援昨夜已經接到民政廳的電話，所以歡迎着我們進去，當夜歇在縣政府，承縣長盛筵欵待；我們在席中知道了土人的村莊，離開縣城還有數里，就决定明晨赴最近的一個土人村落－塘巴堡的計劃。</p>
<p>寒暑表降在零下十二度，室中煨着煤炭，我的頭腦在不知不覺中異常的疼痛起來，大的是受了煤毒的影響。</p>
<p>怕羞的女士</p>
<p>次早晨餐後，縣政府派了一位王主任，二名警察，二匹牲口，送我到城西北三里的塘巴堡去。</p>
<p>二里以後的莊子中，在一家土屋前面，兩根木頭靠着土牆搭成的秋千架上。發現有一對紅衣紅帽的女子，在繩上飄盪。鮮艷的衣服，活潑的姿勢，引着我們跳下馬來隔牆去觀賞，土女知道有生客觀看，，就一鬨下繩散了。</p>
<p>我們牽着馬，沿大路上去沒有多遠，就到一處土房比較多些的白崖子莊。此地是塘巴堡的中心。一個「紅牌」－寨首，－出來招呼我們到他的家裹，紅牌是漢人，他家裹也有坑和火盆。王主任告訴了考察土人風俗的來意，他立刻就傳了五六個老年的土人來。他們因爲近城的關係，都已深傳了漢化，穿戴的全是布衣皮帽，講的也是一口流利的漢話，當我問他們土話時，有許多反而答不上來。</p>
<p>莊前的秋千架上，有幾個土女在游戲，當我們出去預備考察和攝影時，她們都都怕羞逃走去了。但是結果仍被幾個土人追回了四個花花綠的土女，這時她們更不好意思了，當我替她們攝影時，她們都羞得連頭也抬不起來。</p>
<p>莊廟的神秘</p>
<p>現在我們到他們莊廟上去參觀：</p>
<p>廟子在一個聳起的土阜上，沿着石級上去，一轉多是磚墻，開進大門，種着四顆柏樹的庭院，後面一間寬敞的房屋，就是神殿。建築仿西北的廟宇式，挑角很短。黑暗的壁上滿掛着喇嘛敎的神帳，三四尺長一二尺闊的綢布上，繪的宗喀巴釋迦牟尼騾子天王。神帳下面的供桌上列着一排高的八寸的泥佛，在一個模型中做出來，所以多是趺坐的，外面塗着美麗的彩色。土名叫「喳喳。」</p>
<p>正中矮桌上供着許多大饝饝，每一個饝饝有一尺圓徑，二斤重量，這是他們新年中敬神的禮物。在疊疊饝饝的中央供着一枝高的四尺彷彿梭標的神箭，淸油燈的光亮照耀着箭上一綹一綹的紅綠帶條，披茸地如神箭的衣服。箭的頸中掛着一串銅鈴和銅板這是他們最信仰的護法神箭；又叫五台護法。他們莊子上的安寗，就地的農產，土人的健康，據他們說多靠這一枝神箭的呵護。</p>
<p>神箭的左邊供着一只大鵬鳥的神道。牠也同樣得到大饝饝的供奉，他的偶像是一塊木板，平面三尺高，上面貼滿剪碎的紙條，象微「神鵬」的羽毛。在頭上裝出一根長的二寸弧形的木條，作爲神鵬的嘴喙。叉畫着圓形的二個眼瞳，大鵬鳥也是他們一個信仰而靈騐的神道</p>
<p>土人的歌唱</p>
<p>我們今天不預備回縣府，旁晚打發人將縣府的鋪蓋取來。打算找一個土人家裹住下，可以明　士人的一切生活習慣，但是窮苦的土民沒有一處空房能够招待我們這一批新客。所以祇有留在紅牌家裏過夜。</p>
<p>土人是一個能歌的民族，晚上我們打了兩塊錢酒，請來六七個土人唱歌。唱歌土語謂之「道喇。」通他們在田野間隨意抒情的山歌，多是男女酬答的淫詞俚曲。但是吉慶節日，在庭園中唱的，那就須要吉祥的，歷史的歌曲</p>
<p>今晚唱的都是男子，他們環蹲在地下，中間是一壺煨熱了的白酒，大家傳飲幾口，就引吭高歌，歌聲滑越，婉轉動聽，但是調子很簡單，唱的都用漢語，這也許是漢化已深的關係。然而我們還不容易領會歌中的詞句，數闋以後，我因爲要洗照片，所以就打發他們回去。</p>
<p>後來將他們的歌詞錄下，柯鴻　君同時將他們的調子也譜了一隻。</p>
<p>歷史的，歌名「祁家筵席，在結婚時一道喇」用之。</p>
<p>譜：</p>
<p>歌：（其一）二十八宿亂世年問，强盜苗子殺氣騰騰，東頭不反西頭亂，皇上的太子發大義，頭道寨子到來了，二道寨子到大回，三道寨子哭到來，官怕三請不留情，洛陽城賊反年代多，洛陽城賊寇爭大了功，祁總兵做的小小官，兩位把總你試聽，人羣中挑十七十八，馬裏頭挑來多挑四歲五歲兒騙馬，（兒馬卽雄馬，騙馬即閹馬）大紅鞍子水裏纏，絲線肚帶纏又纏，假銀子扯頭梅花鐙，牛角弓鍊條箭，三更四更轉花槍，穿竹桿子馬兒官，苗馬腿跑三百六十的小哥哥。（其二）三十挑大兵，初一發大兵，大砲三聲響，人馬站校場，號召三聲響，人馬往前行，本帥傳將令，衆將細聽吾言，共吃共買共使用，不許擾他好百姓，那一個不准本帥令，推出營門斬梟頭，一點不到打四十，二點不到准打八十，三點不到定要斬。</p>
<p>調情的，在山野間唱的一隻道喇。歌：河那啊！河這啊！千層的牡丹碟子大，</p>
<p>你把哥哥勿惹下；惹下哥哥花採下。</p>
<p>新年的娛樂</p>
<p>次晨是舊歷的年初三，每一家土人的家中在一張瓦片上煨柏枝烟敬神。幾個小孩子驅着一小羣十幾隻綿羊，放在河邊的白地上。河就是沙塘川，二三個紅衣的土女提着兩個水桶在担水。我們很幸運，出門遇到滿水的水桶，這是吉祥的預兆。——是土人們迷信的傳說。</p>
<p>早飯以後莊前的院子裹，圍坐着一羣正在喝酒的男子，這酒是我們昨晚賞的，所以我們一去大家叉開始道喇了。今天人多興致很高，邊唱邊飲，幾個少年已經喝醉了，他們借着醉意情不自禁地拖了二三僩人到田野裹去唱淫辭，因爲詞句的鄙俚，須要避免他們長輩的耳目。</p>
<p>小孩子多在秋千架的底下輪流着學秋千，一般穿新衣的婦女，她們今天見了我們不會再像昨天那樣怕羞躱閃，因爲昨天的照相我已經都曬出送給她們了；她們見着自己的形相，非常驚奇贊歡，因而也就熟習。她們的娛樂是在場上踢健子拋線球。毽子是用羊毛或雞毛銅鈿做的。錢球用羊毛綫纏成的。她們健子的踢法，祇有穩穩的踢數目，以多爲勝。拋錢球是將球向地上一擲，卽一轉身，乘球未落下時接取再擲再轉，亦以多爲勝。當他們在運動的時候，金色的陽光照着她們含笑的紫頰，和飄動的紅衣，她們的心田充滿着新年的快樂。我們去旁觀，她們更玩得起勁。</p>

<h3>邰爽秋等發起　土貨第一年開幕典禮　今日下午在市民教館興同　吳市長潘局長等播音演講</h3>
<p>上海社云、部爽秋·唐茂槐·張翼·張經野·陸叔昻·戚光中·等發起之土貨年、定今日下午二時、在文廟路市立民衆敎育館講　、舉行土貨第一年開幕典禮、並於昨日上午十時、在太夏大學舉行籌備會議、通過宣言等項、茲分誌如决、</p>
<p>大會職員　主席團邰爽秋·潘公展·江問漁張　·張經野·陳頌春、招　黃　頑·唐茂槐·呂吉人·唐叔明·茹伯才、紀錄陳世敏·劉自明、司儀徐鵬程•糾察請市公安局擔任、</p>
<p>市長前綵　幹事會爲喚起一般民衆共同推行起見、特請吳市長·潘局長·播音演講、鈕惕生·潘仰堯·俞佐廷·王立明•鈕長耀•陸叔昂•諸氏到會演說、並請吳市長剪綵啟幕、本市及滬郊各縣機關，團體·學校·均派代表參加、中央黨部·實業部·江蘇省政府·市社會局·亦均有代表蒞會致訓、</p>
<p>發表宣言　自九一八事變發生以來、以至最近華北各地的紛擾、强鄰步步緊逼、國土日日淪喪、民族的命運已至最危急的關頭、吾人愛國、尤　凖備、義憤塡膺的愛國運動、固然可以振懦立頑、喚起民族的意識、激發垂絕的國魂、但時間稍久、除少數有志之士外、不免雨過雲消、一無所剩、對於國家、恐無多大裨益、惟有切實從富根本工作、各人多出一分氣力、即爲國家多增一分力量、如何凖備救國的實力、時賢主張、各不同　我們的意見、則以爲提倡土貨、亦屬基本工作之一、謹貢其愚、以就正於海內賢達、</p>
<p>抵制侵略　　提倡國貨、可以抵制經濟侵略抵制列強經濟侵略的方法、一般皆以爲要提倡國貸、這固然也有充分的理由、不過單用國貨二字來提倡同時也有許多困難、第一通常所謂國貨、槪指機製洋式貨物而言、因其仿製洋貨、維妙維尚、縱特別小心、也往往無法辨別、第二提倡國貨、便把機製洋式貨物、變　國人生活必需的標凖、而有許多貨物、國產數量、供不應求、生活必需、叉不可復缺、遂不得不求之於國外、無形中不覺替洋貨製造市場、有此兩種困難、單用提倡國貨、來抵制經濟侵略、便難得澈底、惟有同時提倡土貨、才能免去這兩種流弊、</p>
<p>發展生產　　提倡土貨可以發展生產發展國民生產主要的辦法、自常提倡機器工業、不過在今日民窮財盡的中國、我們沒有大量的資本和大規模的機器、和人家競爭、故提倡土貨、維持固有的手工生產、亦屬非常重要、雖然它的效率沒有機器那樣大、但是人數衆多、工具又屬固有、可以隨時隨地生產、自能聚沙成塔、產生大量的貨物、但非拘泥於陳腐手工生產方法、一成不變、同時還主張改良手工生　、並月這種辦法僅爲過渡時代所採用的一種手段、絕不能永遠停滯在這種生產方式之下、我們要將要提倡土貨而節省下來之錢、用合作方式去發展農村小機器工業、更遂漸發展成大規模的機器工業</p>
<p>救濟農村　　提倡土貨可以救濟農村　救濟農村的重要、已為國人所公認、談到救濟的方法、如政府免稅、銀行投資、均屬要　、但是最』緊的還在使農村生產出來的土貨、有通暢的出路、吾則貨物滯銷、政府免稅徒有其名、銀行投資亦難穩定、况且我國銀行界的力量、布屬有限、把全國銀行的銀子、都倒入農村、每個農人亦不過攤得兩元、至於五六百萬的欵子、分散開來、何異車薪杯水、若使提倡土貨、允其提倡農民手紡手織之土布、使全國三萬萬農民、於五個月之農閒時間中、皆有工作可做、即以每日賺銀兩分計、每年所得之數、亦當有九萬萬元之譜、比之今日銀行界之放欵數百萬相去殊遠、所以我們堅决主張提倡土貨、提倡鄉下人自用土貨、提倡城裹人購用土貨、我們希望土貨上城、不希望國貨下鄉、我們希望一般企業家到鄉下去發展合作農村生產、不要把鄉下的銀子吸收到城裹來開工廠、使農村金融枯竭、</p>
<p>堅決主張　根據上面的三個理由、所以我們堅决主張提倡土貨、提倡在可能範圍內、一致服用土貨、爲要集中各方力量、以求貫澈起見、我們特集合同志、組織提倡土貨實施委員會、訂定十年進行計劃、喚起民衆共同推進、茲値土貨第一年開幕之期、謹以百分之百的誠意、陳述我們的粗淺主張、敬望各界人士、多多指敎、</p>

<h3>去年度　租界工業狀況</h3>
<p>經濟凋敝廠家日漸不支</p>
<p>調查工作已於六月完成</p>
<p>全年出險二千三百餘决</p>
<p>安全衛生正在積極促成</p>
<p>據工部局總辦處工廠組去年報告、去年本埠工業界所感困難、實至艱鉅、當年初數月之間、大小工廠紛紛倒閉、其閒曾有陸續復業者、而一蹶不振者、亦不在少數、此外復有受經濟之壓迫、不得不從事於减工扣薪以資撙節者、亦不一而足、昔日之日夜開工者、今則僅有日班而無夜班、並有紗廠數家、前此每星期開工六日七夜者、現已减爲三日三夜、有减成發放薪工者、亦有一面减薪、一面加長工作時間者、總之、不外力求成本之减低、以期苟延殘喘耳、</p>
<p>至於工人因受經濟凋敝之影響、墜入失業羣中者、自亦不在少數、惟本埠絕少統計之資料、如失業保險等、旣尚未舉辦、此外更無其他可恃之標準、即前此工廠之已倒閉者、其所儷用之工人數目、幾亦無從調查、</p>
<p>關於工廠房屋之建築、去年較之前年、亦復大見减少、蓋去年所建房屋、大抵係前年已經興工、而不能不於去年完工者、至於去年新開工之廠家、計有大規模紗廠一家、大小毛織品廠家四所、火油漆廠一家、及大釀酒廠二家、此皆是年工廠成立之足紀者也、</p>
<p>中國當局設施　是年十月十三日、南京實業部有工廠安全及衛生檢查糊則公佈、同時即作爲工廠法第二期實施之開始、此等細則、因其性質　屬合同、他日工廠檢查問題一日解决之後、即可作爲實施進展之張本、惟工廠安全及衛生之標凖、促進極難、今所能行者、惟有將他國所已實施、並行之有效者、時時以消息公佈、俾引起各工廠中人、觀感之念、惟如何能使工廠主人、對於管理當局完全了解、則尚待以漸進之手段、及教育之程序、促成之云、</p>
<p>調查工作完成　公共租界各工廠調查工作、開始於一九三四年之二月、至一九三五年之六月告竣是項調查工作、所得資料、極為有益、如工廠排洩物之多寡、及其化學成分、工廠職工人數等、大抵均與工務之進行、有密切關係、故調查工作、即由工務處人員負之、至十一月終、統計公共租界大小工廠作場等、凡三千四百二十三家、再則工務處負責調查得力人員三人、自七月一日始、即調工廠組任事、彼等對於各種機械應　、素有　長　經過此次調查工作之後、經騐益見　充、故自調用之後、已各就其原有之學識及特到之閱　開媽其教育改進工作矣、</p>
<p>工業出險概況　去年租界工業、雖受經濟凋　之影響、惟危險事件之次數、反較前年爲多、蓋去年出險事件這報告者、共二千二百零一件、而前年則為一千七百八十八件、惟此不能即認為工作人數减少、而危險發生反多、因本埠危險事件之報告、並無强迫施行之制、可恃者惟各工廠主人、各醫院·以及警務處、救護車組、等之自動通知、故報告决數之增加、未必定屬可憂、蓋在他一方面言之、即屬各方面與工廠管理當局、合作日臻密切、亦屬進步之表現也、以上報告二千三百件之中、其來自醫院常局者佔一千六百十五、大抵自接得報告之後、即開始調查、而工廠常局、則大部份均已不待工廠組之調查、即已自動辦理襯救善後之方、即或有須待指導者、亦能於第二决調查之前、遵照辦妥、此亦可見敎育之略見成效、與工廠知識逐漸普遍也、</p>
<p>危險年齡時間　危險事件發生後、受傷工友年齡、以及危險事件發生最多之時間、去年已開始着手調查、據云、在受傷工人一千五百八十二人之中、未滿二十歲者五百零九人、二十一歲至二十五歲者三百十三人、二十六至三十者二百零八人、三十一至三十五者、二百零一人、據上述之統計、自受傷工友之中、二十歲以下者佔三分之一且彼等所報年齡、大多俱係陰歷、實則俱在十八歲左右、至全部工人中、十八歲以下者究佔若干成一份、現尚不得而知、惟彼等大半係屬未受訓練、並不領工薪之學徒、此亦大可注意之事也、至於危險事件發生之時間、最高額在晨十時至十一時、决高額爲下午四時至五時、由此可知者、即危險最易發生之時間、爲每日上午及下午工作若干時疲倦發生之後、大都不甚注意之時、再則死傷原因、仍以失火爲最多、去年各工廠因失火受傷者、凡一百十三人、其中傷重不救者三十四人云、</p>
<p>醫院努力合作　去年各工廠發生危險事件、其經各醫院當局報告者、實佔大多數、彼等因深知此種合作、足以减少將來之危險、故俱樂與協助、惟間亦有不明事理者、僅可設法逐漸行之耳、再則工廠主人之自動報告者、亦不在少數、彼等之忠誠合作、頗有益於預防方法改進之研究、此外警務處及火政處之救護車糾、亦時有良好資料、供給於工廠組云、</p>
<p>工廠安全促進　租界工廠安全之促進、在某某等方面、現已脫離試騐之時期、而入於實施之時代、即如鍋爐主人、前此自裝置迄今、未曾經過檢查者、現已逐漸加以各種注意、凡具有危險性之廠家、俱已促成其設備上之改進、去年六月、大中華賽璐珞玩具廠之大火、足使各工廠主人、引爲殷鑒、各橡膠廠之設備、亦已大見改進、製服公司之用膠棉等爆烈物者、噴漆作場之用多量火酒者、以及銲金作場之用亞羸氣燈者、俱已一一設法使之改良矣、本埠關於工廠安全設備之勸導、所感覺困難者、即工業博物館之缺乏、甚雖引起工廠管事人之觀感、現所可行者、即某廠危險旣發生之後、即召集其他　等廠家管事者若干人、前往參觀、隨時隨地指示機宜、俾於覜者之腦中、發生一種印象、此外工廠組之辦公室中、亦有一小規模之電機、上有自動安全機之裝置、隨時可以導觀、</p>
<p>促進健康衛生　此外復有若干工業、、於普通安全問題之外、附帶有工人健康之危險者、健康之危險者、如工場光綫缺乏、空氣惡濁、四週汚穢等、亦在陸續訓令改良之中、再則如鍍金作中、鍍鉻時所發出之烟氣、於鼻孔皮膚等、均有侵蝕之危害再則如五金磨光作中、四散噴射之粉末、亦極於工人之建康有碍、去年之中、各工場主人、俱已設法使裝置隔離氣體之設備、至於工場衛生方面之改進、去年深賴雷士德醫學研究院諸翳士之努力、及本局衛生處之合作、得有顯著之成效、去年所調查者、如印刷業工友之生活狀况、蓋七海印刷工人、佔全部工人十分之一、惟經調查之印刷工人一百八十九人中、其身體健康合格者、竟不及三分之一、亦可見工人生活之一斑矣、决則、復調查鈹金及磨金等工場、結果如何、不久即可發表、再則如工人飯食、亦已有相當之調查、不久亦將公佈、其他如各大工廠工友生活狀態、敎育設施、勞資恊調等問題、亦均在日漸促進之中、</p>

<h3>上海之證券業（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之十七）</p>
<p>公會時代之證券業—所謂公會時代之證券業者。即上海股票商業公會之時代也。亦即爲目前華商證券交易所之前身也。自成立以迄改組。前後凡六年。會員自十三家增至五十餘家。而非會員與小錢莊之兼營證券者。猶未加入計算。該公會之產生。實爲時勢所造成。蓋因股票買賣。自元年六厘。元年八厘等內國公債之發行。以及蘇浙路之收歸國有。一時營業鼎盛。股票掮客之進益。甚形可觀。於是兼營此股票業者。亦由六七人而增加一倍。交易日繁。競爭日烈。因此感覺茶會上交易之不便。乃有此公會之組合。而滬上西商早有此種組織，亦爲促其產生之原因。（西商組織，即爲上海股份公所，俗名上海股票公會。英文名稱Shanghai　Sharebrokers’Association該公所成立於遜淸光緒十七年。叉於光緒三十一年。遵照香港政府股份有限公司條例。改組爲ShanghI　Stock　Exchaeng並定華名爲上海衆業公所當時之橡皮股票交易。曾盛極一時。而滬上華商之從事於此種賣買者。亦大有其人）。該公會曾呈請農商部批准註册。設會所於九江路渭水坊。其組織係採會長制。設正副會長各一人。正會長主持會務。副會長襄理一切。又設會董若干人，以扶助會長之不足。會長之任期爲一年，負促進會務之責。當創立之初。會員殊渺。統計不過十三家。期時營業之進展旣綏。而公會之開支浩大。維持甚難。於是乃按會員營業範圍之大小。分四等徵收會費。甲種月繳二十四元。乙種二十元。丙種十二元。丁種六元。而定甲乙兩種爲維持會員。丙丁爲普通會員。其後會員增加事業擴大。會費等級。遂亦不復勝在矣。至於公會市場之佈置。首定集會時問爲每日上午九時至十一時。同時並制定佣金之標準兩種。以昭大信。</p>
<p>甲　記名式之證券。如公司股票。其買賣之成交。必須經過照票。立讓股書。及覓舖保等等。手續旣繁。風險又大。且有時發生意外糾葛。故佣金之征收較巨。按照票面每百元收取一元或五角。</p>
<p>乙　不記名之證券。如公債票等。手續簡單。立時可以成交。故佣金征收較薄。每百元之票面收取二角五分。並在每日集會時間終了後。由公會將常日買賣成交價格。編製行情單。分送在會同業。至於營業範圍。亦由公會依照習慣定爲二種。A，現貨買賣一切現貨交易隸屬之。B，委托買賣數量較大之買賣。得由顧客限定價格。委托會員在市場交易。此種買賣成交，於言定後。即日下午舉行之。即俗稱所謂代客買賣也。當時營業之種類。較諸月前。繫複逾倍。雖其成交數字，遠遜目前。迨至民七。歐戰方殷。國內企業。蓬蓬勃勃。政府公債。陸續發行。如七短，七長，金融等。當時信用鞏固。人民投資。頗爲踴躍。而銀行亦備有需求。充作發　準備。於是證券買賣。日增月盛。上海華商證券交易所遂應運而生矣。今將其詳細情形。說叨如左。</p>
<p>該所經過華商證券交易所成立於民國九年。係范季美，孫鐵卿，張文煥等發起組織。營業種類。以政府發行之公債庫券爲主·輔以公司行號之股票。招致經紀人五十五位。當時資本僅二十萬元。分一萬股。每股二十元。營業房屋。初尚租賃。兩年後營業發達。乃增資本爲五十萬元。十一年又增爲一百萬元。並進而遵照公司法規定。由股東會票選孫鐵卿君爲理事長。（常時創辦人范季美君已因故退出）張文煥爲常務理事。夏履平·俞子毅·陳蘭庭·尹韻笙·王本滋·姚蔭鵬·顧叔美·袁崧藩·李廉波·爲理事。莫杏林·薜竹蓀·爲監察。同時範圍逐漸擴大。內部組織。亦見健全。計分總務·計算·場務·會計·四科。分掌各事。民十三。自購基地。建造三層新屋於漢口路叫十五號。（今改爲四二二號）落成之日。適遇九六風潮。營業一落千丈。幾瀕破產。時理事長孫鐵卿亦因病出缺。乃由張文煥氏繼任。此爲該廳最凋零枯竭之時期也。及民十六。國府奠都南京。因軍政費需欵浩繁。陸續發行各種債券逾十餘萬高。全恃該所爲之流通週轉。因此營業鼎盛。飛黃騰達。截至二十三年度下半屆之經手費收入。竟達國幣一百三十一萬五千零九十七元二角七分。股東紅利。超逾七分以上。票面二十元之股票價格。市值達七十四元。創歷屆未有之紀錄。此為該所之全盛時期中間雖受「九一八」「一二八」兩决影響。交易曾一度消淡。但較諾民十六前尚有霄壤之別。二十一年夏。應時勢之需要。增設理事四人。監察一人。同時以市塲狹隘。舊有房屋。不敷辦公。乃遵照二十年份股東會之議决。撥欵百萬。興建八層大厦於原址。並擴共基地。將證券里房室全部收回。期年竣工。冠其名曰「證券大樓」。更設置房產保管科。掌理經租事務。二十二年六月一日。遵奉法令。實行與上海證券物品交易所之證券部份合併。並增加資本二十萬元。及經紀人二十五位。（前後共計八十位）辦事人員亦大事增加。共計職員一百四十餘人。規模之巨。交易之盛。在各交易所之上。（未完）</p>

<h3>紀念總理逝世與國貨運動</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今天是孫中山先生逝世紀念日，全國各地必有一番沉痛的紀念。</p>
<p>回憶總理在日，除致力國民革命拯救中華民族解放之外，對於提倡國貨，亦不遺餘力。記得在三民主義的民族主義演講中，總理嘗說：「我們中國除了受列强的政治侵略外，還受了經濟的侵略，所謂經濟的侵略，便是洋貨的進口，每年要搜括我們中國的金錢，總數的在五萬萬元以上，所以我們不特要注意列强的有形的政治侵略，允其要注意他們無形的經濟侵略……，在這一段演講裹，孫先生是暗示了我們提倡國貨和服用國貨的重要。</p>
<p>孫先生逝世迄今，已有整整的十一個年頭了！我們提倡國貨的成效如何？服用國貨的成績怎樣？這還是一個値得反省的問題。雖然，提倡國貨運動，高喊到現在，已有五六個年頭，可是任你口誅筆伐，舌敝唇焦，而全國同胞，還不能做到大半服用國貨的地步，這是有目共見的事實。我很希望大家在今天紀念總理逝世的時候，把總理的話，細細的回憶一下，研究一番，立下一個服用國貨的决心，那才不失紀念的意義。</p>
<h3>在桐油大宗輸出期國人宜速計劃植桐</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>提倡國貨，不僅以勸導國內的民衆服用爲限，允當注意於海外貿易，我國從前向以「絲」「茶」二項，爲出口大宗，現在這二項，一因墨守舊法，不知改良；二因他邦盡力仿製，所以一落千丈，淪於失敗地位，實深浩嘆！但從去年迄今，桐油一項的出口，驟然激增，這不能不稱爲差强人意的事，據海關發表，本年一月份出口貨爲三七，三四四，三四一元，進口貨爲三五，九五二，二六八元，計出超一，三九二，○七三元，而桐油出口達八，五六元，二五六元，又佔本屆各項出口貨中之首位，（去歲桐油出口總數已見本刋茲不贅）可知桐油在今日，爲各國軍用上科學上需要的迫切，我人實不容忽視！目前各貨輸出衰退，獨桐油得佔優勢，藉以稍塞漏巵，自是國貨前途的好現象，很可欣慰的事，然我人乘此時期，對於提倡植桐，實爲當務之急！</p>
<p>特此舉最好先由政府通令全國種植農塲及鄉民等，勸導從速種植桐油，而對於產量佳良者，規定獎勵辦法，使農民等，大家樂於栽植，好在我國各處的曠野很多，或因地質關係，不合宜於種禾黍的，儘可改植油桐，而且油桐比較他種林木，容易滋長，獲利允速，至於秧種的選擇，却要審愼，應當選他的佳種，那末在長成後，才能够結成纍纍的桐實，榨取多量的桐油，不過凡事宜速不宜緩！原因是近今已有他國，鑒於植桐獲利豐厚，多在研究試種，還望國人及早努力培植，銳意改良，總冀出品優美，質量加多，輸出有增無已，實爲推銷國產挽回利權維一的大道。</p>
<h3>觀國貨金龍滅火彈試放後感</h3>
<p>— 呆</p>
<p>最近在上海這都市之中，有過幾次滅火彈的試放，所謂滅火彈，據說家裏偶然不慎而失火，祇要火勢還沒有貫穿屋頂，那麼你如果把滅火彈投射在着火的地方，火立刻會消滅的。這種滅火彈，最初到上海的，我們知道是德國貨！但相隔不久，就有國人自製的滅火彈發現於市場之中。</p>
<p>同時，利衆實業公司所製的國貨金龍牌滅火彈，最近在二月二十七二十八兩日，又在南市大吉路公共體場試放。找得到了試放滅火彈的消息，二十七日的午後，便特地到體育場去參觀。因爲金龍滅火彈的確靈騐非常，所以參觀過後，樂為本刊讀者介紹，並附帶表示我觀後的一些感想。</p>
<p>這種滅火彈，高六吋，周圍十一吋半，外面是藍色的玻璃殼，裹面是儲滿了藥水。因爲用眞空法裝置，所以玻璃殼不碰破的話，藥水是永久不變而更不會乾涸的。裹面的藥水是用各種氣體化合而成爲白色透明的液體，如果遇到火警，把彈投在火裹彈破藥流，遇熱蒸發而成爲一種不能燃燒的氣體，這種氣體，比空氣重九倍，而氣化體積爲三千倍，有極强烈的擴漲性和降壓性，所以能够迅速把火撲減。凡非空曠之地而在有叫壁的房屋之間，雖體積較大，也可投此彈以滅火，而且減火的迅速，更有不可思議之處呢！</p>
<p>當試放的時候，先用木板釘成一間小屋，下面舖了些棉衣，木屑之類，都是在油裹浸透的，四壁更澆滿了火油，所以燃了火之後，這間小屋之中，立刻火勢猛烈，不可收拾。就是火勢猛烈之時，在來賓之中請了一位代表，把滅火彈投射在火焰之中，真是再廳怪不過的，這樣猛烈的火勢，碰到了藥火的氣味立刻消滅了。接着又試放一决，第二决比第一决的火勢更猛烈，但也被藥彈撲滅了。又參觀的人，目覩了這種情形，每個覺得有些神秘呢！</p>
<p>不過據他們公司中人說，這種滅火彈的使用，也要得乎其法，才會靈騐。特別要注意的就是：　應自低處向火燄最高最强的堅硬部份投擲，才能立見功效。因爲火燄愈强，藥水的氣化力愈速，投擲愈高，氣體的降壓力也愈大，至於堅硬的地方，比較易使彈殼破碎，所以奏效更是迅速。　勿投擲於火勢甚小或未會着火的地方，因爲藥水無從化氣，不能發揮牠滅火的效能。　勿自上投下，或投擲過低，使藥氣傷失其自然降壓滅火的機能。　勿投擲於曠野之地或火燄已貫穿屋頂之室內，因爲藥氣飛散，便不能滅火的。</p>
<p>我看了滅火彈試放的成功而後，覺得在救火設備不周的地方，這種滅火彈更見有購置的必要。在農村或小鎭市上，我們時常可聽見爲了救火設備的缺乏，一家失火之後，燒去多家，所以在內地要是缺乏救火的設備，那麼滅火彈可補救無法滅火眼，看其延燒的缺點，大可每一個人家購置幾顆滅火彈，以防星火的燎原。不過我們另一面知道金龍滅火彈每顆要售法幣四元，一般的平民，在農村破產，都市不景氣聲中，似乎經濟能力還够不上每家買三五顆滅火彈，藏在家裹，以作防火之用，所以滅火彈而要推銷到內地，售價方面，似乎還應得設法使其低减，不知利衆公司以爲何如？</p>
<h3>來函</h3>
<p>逕啟者，閱三月五日第一五四期</p>
<p>貴刊所載「彈簧大算盤之發明」一文，承原著人孫君獎飾，並蒙貴編者加具按語，予以宣傳，無任感紉！惟孫君所見之大算盤，恐係某國出品，在二十年前，我國小學校間有購用者。（爲數極少）該項大算槃珠柱，係用銅絲製成，撥動算珠時，因銅絲柔輭，易於灣曲，故未能上下自如，而薄銅片之管形彈簧，套在珠孔內部，因珠係木質，使用不久，木質在乾燥之空氣中，自然縮小，珠孔即行寬大，於是彈簧與算珠脫離而算槃即無用矣。該項大算盤，有此兩大缺點，故在市上銷路未暢，且不久即絕跡不見。至於君平創製之彈簧珠大算盤，與該項彈簧大算盤絕對不同，柱檔用紅木製成，且係方形，在每一顆算珠內，另鑽一孔，裝製彈簧，迨套上珠柱，彈柱相抵，不致下墜，輕輕撥動，即上下自如，毫不費力；且彈簧密藏珠內，故在外部絕不見彈簧裝置之所在，因此亦永無脫落之虞，更無彈力减弱及銹壞之弊。此項彈簧珠大算槃，前年呈由實業部交獎勵工業技術審查委員會審查，該會評爲「現時學校中之大算槃，或用毛柱者，或用弦線者，均不及其便利。」嗣奉實業部核給第二七號專利證書，准予專利五年，又前年敎育部主辦之全國職業學校及中小學校勞作科成績展覽會，亦送往參加展覽，其總評判報告云：凌君之彈簧珠算盤，更屬成品優良，切合實際應用，似應獎勵提倡。」嗣奉敎育部給予甲種獎狀，並由部通令全國各省市敎育行政主管機關轉飭所屬各小學一體採用。此項彈簧珠大算盤，分甲乙兩種，甲種二十一檔，乙種十七檔，各地商務印書館均有發售</p>
<p>貴刋對於國產貨品，宣傳提俱，不遺餘力，至爲欽佩，茲因孫君所述與君平所發明之算槃並非一物，深恐各方誤爲君平仿製某國出品，冒充發明，引起購用者之懷疑，爲特不嫌詞費，具函聲明，敬希</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（九）（七）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>一時又回復了沉靜，忽然在牆上聽見輕敲三響，灰娘顯露着驚恐，可是在她還沒記起要說「結是歇麼呢？」（註六）之前，那個黃紙火爐的背面却先已豁然開了，而那仙人義母到後來總算從那個門戶將身子和一個尖帽子擠了出來。這是南恩扮的，穿着一件紅袍，戴着一頂小帽，携了一根仙杖，揮着，同時堅决地說道：</p>
<p>「你必定會去，親愛的。」</p>
<p>灰娘拖拖她的黃袍回答道：現在你須一拉，把我美麗的衣服顯出來。」</p>
<p>『不，不，你得說，「我穿了破爛的衣服，怎麼能去呢？」』那義母用她自己的聲音回答道。</p>
<p>「呀眞的，我應得那麼說；」於是那姑娘居然照說一遍，對於她的遺忘，若無所動。</p>
<p>「因爲你好，所以我把你的衣着掉做了一套美麗的服製，」那義母說着，道一决倒是用舞台音調的：於是慢呑吞爲她解去了那椶黃色的遮胸大圍，到末了才顯出了一番炫目的光景。</p>
<p>那小娘子實在是够美麗，可以打動許多靑年的心，因爲她的母親先把她打扮得眞像一朵好花，穿上一件玫瑰色絲的長衣，緞子的裙，並且這裏那裹揷些小花，看去眞是悅目。那個義母，將一個滿披了緋色和潔白的羽毛的冠，放在她的頭上，又給她一雙銀色紙做的跳舞鞋，她就穿上了，便立了起來，拿起她的裙邊，把鞋子給看客看個淸楚，得意地說道，「我的馨鞋子，它們不美麗嗎？」（註七）</p>
<p>她現在是得意忘形了，好容易才使她記得自己是劇中的一個角色，後來總算設這；</p>
<p>「可是我沒有楷子，溪母。」（註八）</p>
<p>「看罷！」恩揮着她的仙杖那麼起勁，她幾乎要把那小娘子的冠冕打掉了。到此方發現了全劇裏最大的精采，先看見一根粗繩在台板。</p>
<p>（注六）「這是什麼呢？」之音訛</p>
<p>（註七）馨！新</p>
<p>（註八）楷子！車子　溪母！寄母</p>

<h3>紗花　實銷活躍　紗價暴騰</h3>
<p>遠期逼近二百十元關</p>
<p>紗市轉堅、且漲風狂熾、蓋以邇來現紗走銷活躍、日紗根子大感缺乏、同時海外花紗狀况一律向高峰推進、人心振奮、市盤乃節節上騰、金融界吸收之額不動、但同業仍在空頭地位、大阪三品紗飛漲二元六角至三元云、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈近穩遠則高漲之象、以洋電報價、回漲一二角左右不等、市場人心、對於近遠期之觀瞻、已經不同、近期雖稱存底不旺、但非實銷引動、不能繼漲、六月份以下、半以春寒驟雨、半則歐洲風雲、未能即轉和緩、故業外買氣、致集中、市面之漲度、遂亦以遠期為巨大、迨至下午開盤、本月份因多頭回出、反見略鬆、六月份以下之新粉、以買氣依然暢旺、又提一二分、上下午共提四分之譜、照目下情勢推測、恐遠期尚有提高之勢、庶幾與四月份漸相接近云、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨農天雨不止、河下各帮到船稀少、僅十七八號、各貨價格均喊漲二三四角不等、市上雖有做開、亦未能斛出、</p>
<h3>客秈洋米漲勢轉定</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、到頭續有九江與湘漢浙　各路　到、而去路則囤胃已呆、客帮如內地北洋祗有洋米應酬、祗恃本街單帮問津、漲勢立時　挫、雖河下米見漲二三角、而客秈以消化較淡、市即轉平、全日開出贛米二千二百包、湘漢各機米一千五百五十包、溫甬米一百四十　包、統由本街辦去、</p>
<p>昨日洋米交易轉活、內地本街與天津各帮均有問津、惟洋米存底尙足、目有碎米繼續成交、高機米亦在兜攬中、市價雖以再漲、統市開出茄辣地一千六百包、　絞　千二百包、暹邏米彔一千五百包、新交易則有暹邏三號碎五百噸、目傳尙有三四號碎米與較　之米彔在接洽中、故一部份人心又復轉軟云、</p>

<h3>國難時期的出版方針</h3>
<p>— 周寒梅</p>
<p>有智慧，有遠大目光的人，他對於一自己所處的時代和環境，是很善於處理和應付的：並且他所處理和應付的方針，並不爲了他一個人，或是他所屬的一小部份，而是有系統有計劃的推進這時代，改造這環境，充份地在現代分工合作的社會制度之下，發揮着最可能的努力，最高度的貢獻。過去中國的出版事業，我們不能諱言，牠是專門站在「生意眼」的觀點上出發的，因此，文藝書籍風行的時代，瘋在地出版文藝書籍，至於在這瘋在的數年間，究竟建設了一點什麼文藝的理論來，或不朽的名作來呢？這是誰也不敢說的，固然，這責任並不完全在出版界，然而至少出版界是可以推動這工作的，直到現在爲止，連一世界文學名著之系統的完美的譯作，也一不能找出一全部，這眞不能不使我們戚到很大的缺憾！在社會科學書籍昌盛的時代，字句不通，含義艱澀的譯作，竟也出現了不少，這種貽誤自己而又貽誤讀者的事情，到今日舊事重提，誰也不無感慨系之吧！「生意眼」的結果，究竟有多少「生意」可做呢？</p>
<p>過去的不必談了，將來也似乎太遠，我們不妨來把握現實。今日的中國，誰也知道國步艱難，而且一九三六年的危機，已經展開在眼前了。以書局而論，經濟之不景氣讓者購買力之薄弱，老實說，出版界在今日，眞是遭逢了一個空前的艱苦；不過，我們對於空前的艱苦，必須有一個正確而情楚的認識，要知道這不獨出版界爲然，其他各業，莫不如此，而且這艱苦是隨民族整個的國難而俱來，决不是丟開民旅的大問題而可以先解决得了自己的小問題的，在國家爭存亡生死的關頭，每一個民衆，祇有出死力以保衛國家，出路，有財捐財，有力出力。那麼出版界在這國難期間，應該盡些什麼責任呢？</p>
<p>我們深信，出版界在國難期間的工作，可以增長整個民族求生存的力量，也可消蝕整個民族求生存的力量，這一轉移之間，僅在出版方針的一念之相差而已。筆者深信中國的出版界不少聰明才智之士，也許已有目光遠的出版家，已在他的出版計劃中邁進，但也許有一部份從事於出版事業的人們，正憂惶終日，尚在縝密考慮之中，筆者無似，願貢一得之愚！</p>
<p>國難期間的出版方針，詳細的方案，尚有待另文商討，現在先提出三個原則，敬請國內時賢指敎！</p>
<p>第一是非常時的，而不是平時的在這國家逢到空前危機到臨的時侯，全國的民力財力，都將有一决整個民族的大决鬥。現代的戰爭，决不是軍事的，而是軍事，政治，經濟，文化的大搏戰，所以如何可使自己的力量運用得非常經濟而有効，這就有待於事前的訓練，這事前的訓練工作，是最重要的一件事。佔訓練工作最重要的一部份工作，便是訓練材料的問題，這訓練材料的供給，出版界是應該義不容辭的擔負起來的。所謂非常時的而不是平時的，就是指這訓練材料之供給。凖此而論，那麼不僅軍事知識，戰事常識等應大量出版，就是國際政治經濟等分析現狀的知識，一和自然科學社會科學原理的和應用的高深的知識，也應該充份地供給現在的一個最大的前提，並不在整理國故，保存國粹，發揚國學，而是在保存國命。一切的事業，一切的工作，都應以此爲出發，以此爲歸宿，所以國難時期的出版方針，其出版書籍的性質，應該是適應非常時的需要，而並不是像太平盛世時那樣旣要廣又要遠的。</p>
<p>第二一元的，而非多元的　過去中國的出版界，一向是艷羨着歐美學術自由的空氣，以為無論那一個政黨的書籍，那一種學術的研究，在政治上，行勸上固然可以受到相當拘束，但在學術研究的領域內，應該是絕無障礙的，因此「出版自由」的要求，與「新聞開放」同樣高唱入雲。關於「新聞開放」這問題，不在我們討論之列，而「出版自由」，却是値得我們研究的。老實說：絕對的出版自由，在這地球上是找不到這一個國家的，不論社會主義的國家如蘇維埃，資本主義的國家如英美法，法西斯主義的國家如意德等，「出版限制」僅有程度上的差異，而根本沒有絕對自由的事實。爲什麼在國難期間出版物的思想更應該是一元的而不是多元的呢？因爲在一個國家爭生死存亡的時候，步伐必須統一，陣錢必須鞏固；而統一的步伐，與鞏固的陣容，是產生在思想和信仰上的一致；假定事前的訓練材料，還是多方面的，還是出發在幾個絕對不相同的信仰上的，那麼因思想信仰之不同，步伐必不能整齊，而陣容更不易嚴密。以散亂而不統一的一義，想爭民族的生存，豈非夢囈？所以國難時期出版方針的第二個原則，所有出版物的中心信仰，必須是一元的，而絕不可多元的。</p>
<p>第三是大衆的，而不是貴族的國難期間的訓練材料，是每一個民衆所需要的，而是每一個識字的民衆所必須置辦的，中國人民的購買力雖然薄弱，但是這最後的而必須購買的出版物，民衆决不會吝惜。不過中國的大衆是貧苦的，假定定價昻貴，那麼對於這訓練材料的流傳，一定要發生障礙。過去的出版物往往祇有三四萬字的書，却用了四號字排版，道林紙印刷，再加上金字精裝，於是定價至少要一塊錢。這種書賈給大學敎授，或一般購書而不讀書的公子哥兒們放在紅木書架上當裝飾品，誠然不差，給中國的大棄去購買，當然祇好望洋興嘆了。這一點，在太平盛世時，已有提出研究的價値，而在非常時的訓練材料，允應指出這一種辦法是不可寬容的錯誤。所以在國難期間的出版物，定價應特別低廉，以足够血本爲度，决不能再希望一個人發了財到巴黎避難去做一個猶太人。定價應大衆化而不能貴族化，是第三個重要的原則。</p>
<p>這是出版界當前的一個嚴重問題，筆者深信有遠大目光的中國出版家們，對於這一個問題一定有更好的修正，勿補充！</p>
<h3>「青年軍事常識」的介紹</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>王錫綸編譯　商務出版</p>
<p>在出版界非常沉悶而又凌亂的印象中，商務印書館出版了一部「靑年軍事常識」，當然是很値得注意而又異常重要的一部書。</p>
<p>誰都痛感國家地位之危迫，誰都臘意以一己的智力，體力，財力貢獻給國家，可是怎樣實獻呢？如何効命呢？我想除掉武裝同志以外，不論優秀的或普通的知識份子，都有「心有餘而力不足」之嘆，非但如此，簡直連自己逃命的本領都沒有，邊論其他了。少數的知識份子是如此，其他一般不識字的大衆更不必談了。這是何等危險而可怕的事。</p>
<p>國難已到了不是請願遊行所可了事的階段，一般民衆也已到了不是宣傳聽口號所可滿足的階段，那麼實際的準備工作是怎樣呢？連普通的一本軍事常識的刋物且不可得，還談得到其他的一切嗎？在這現狀之下，我們對於王錫綸先生編譯。商務印書館版的「靑年軍事常識」，實在不能不引起很大的注意，而詳密地瀏覽了一决以後，更鄭重地介紹給讀者的必要。</p>
<p>該書一共分爲三冊，第一本是「陸軍」，第二本是「海軍」，第三本是「軍事航空」。作者現在把牠分別介紹如次：</p>
<p>陸軍</p>
<p>在這本小册子裹，牠把中國的國防機關如軍事委員會，參謀本部，軍事參議院等的組織和任務，首先加以說明：然後把我國陸軍編製，兵役，國民軍事敎育，軍人的階級等，加以闡述；其决把步兵，騎兵，砲兵，工兵，輜重兵，憲兵等的任務，和作戰時的常識等，也都加扼耍的叙述。再其决把陸軍的新舊兵器，如步槍，機關槍，火砲，電氣砲，戰車，毒氣等，一一加以說明；使用的方法，以及每種兵器的利弊，也有比較的分析；最後把世界各國陸軍的現狀，加以統計，讀者並可得到一個比較的槪念。</p>
<p>海軍</p>
<p>這本書分類方法，和陸軍是一樣的：首先叙述我國海軍的組織，如海軍部，艦隊編制等；决述海軍艦艇的種類和任務，如戰鬥艦，巡洋艦，航空母艦，潛水艇等的戰鬥力，防禦力，以及構造等，都有扼要的說明；再其决是海軍兵器的闡述，關於大艦，水電，光學兵器，電氣兵器，化學兵器等的使用，効能，原理等，都有簡要的叙途；最後是世界各國海軍的現狀和統計，讀者同樣可以得到一個比較的槪念。</p>
<p>軍事航空</p>
<p>空軍在現代的戰爭裏，是可以决定一個戰爭的成和敗，勝和負的，牠不僅可發揮威力毀滅敵人的陣地，而且可搗亂敵人的後方，毀滅敵人的後方；所以今後的戰爭，實在是立體戰爭。在這本小冊子裹，除掉說明軍用飛機的特徵和種類外，對於戰鬥機，偵察機，轟炸機，運輸機，敎練機等的功能，裝置，戰鬥能力，作戰方法等，都有簡要的說明；致於空中襲擊防禦襲擊的方法，也有詳細的叙述；最後是世界各國空軍現狀的報告和統計，讀者，當然可以得到一個淸楚的槪念。</p>
<p>這一部「靑年軍事常識」，不僅在文字方面有淺顯扼要的說明，而且刋載了差不多有二分之一的篇幅的攝影，讀者在國文參閱之中，當然更可以瞭然於陸，海，空三軍的內容，而接受軍事上的基本知識了。該書的內容，確實相當完備，適合於中國國民一般的需要，筆者雖推薦於讀者大衆之前。倘使定價能低廉一點，那麼我想造福於中國的民衆，更非淺鮮了。</p>
<p>電信效率第一卷第五期出版　電信效率係電信特刊社主編，現聞該刋第　卷第五期已經出版。其要目有：　尹國墉之市內電話之話務研究，　黃修靑之電桿之採購及其程式問題，　錢其琛之歐美電話事業調查簡報，　束方之改訂中的國音電報，　長途電話價目之我見，均係電界名著。其餘尚有論文多篇，並載有交通部最近頒行之法令，國內國際電政大事，及日本特的通信，名目繁多，不勝詳載，內容較前益加充實云。社址南京中山北路七六九號。訂價全年僅收紙料資五角。凡欲知我國電政改革途徑者，不可不讀者。</p>

<h3>淋病的治藥</h3>
<p>— 馮善樑</p>
<p>欲言治淋諸有效藥物，先須說明淋病的諾項療法，在未說治淋各法之前，須先把淋病是怎樣的一種疾症以及其狀等等，略說一說，然後可以明瞭何種方法爲合理，何種藥品爲有效，乃至何者爲不合理了，首决感染淋病，大都是急性前尿道淋，例外的很少，所謂前尿道淋，就是指淋菌僅在前尿道部分侵襲繁殖著而言，照理局所的病息，只須行局所的治療已可，撲殺淋菌的藥物，俯拾即是，何須行其他療法一，何以中外醫家都認爲牠是難治之症呢，因爲淋菌是潛伏在尿道粘膜內層的，欲圖盡殲淋菌，而絲毫無損於粘膜，在此狹隘辦法之下，所以覺得困難了，但能施之有素，自能根本痊愈，療淋的方法有種種，電療，洗射，注射及內服，電療法利用透熱法者，有長波短波之別，長波須緊貼皮膚而施行，不但施用麻煩，且多弊病，時有灼傷肌膚之虞，而收效鮮少，近世所賞用者，莫如短波透熱電，隔衣可以療治，奏效亦復確速，其利用電械之光力以殺菌者，莫如最新療濁機，此機之光力，旣可深透肌膚，且毫無損害，洗射法，洗液對於病情之分配，使用之濃度和時間，在在相關，現時更賞用淋病血淸之注入，此種製劑中之最佳者，爲「淋毒舒樂耳」，注射藥，如「混合淋苗」及色素製劑之「安抵雪淸」及「脫呂帕弗拉文」等爲上，內服藥，以能止痛消炎殺菌力强，能深透粘膜，切忌含有强力之收斂成份，現時各醫界所採用之「滅殺淋」，頗爲適宜，乃屬優良之製劑，治淋雖如上述，然疾病變化萬端，未可一槪論也，且淋病之治療，雖以一毫之差，卽遺無窮之害，如愈期延長，荏苒成慢性等等，此皆錯施方法，藥石妾投之結果也。</p>
<h3>淋病與生育</h3>
<p>— 劉玄</p>
<p>女子不妊，可分爲生理的天然缺點與夫疾病的因素，因天然的缺點而不妊之女子，極爲少見，茲姑不述，此外大都因疾病而不妊爲多，疾病足以影嚮生育亦有好幾種，姑就以淋病來簡述一下。患淋病而致不能生育之女子，最爲普遍而常見，在醫學實騐上之統計，調查女子不妊症之原因，十分之六七，爲由患淋病而起，此可知淋病與生育之絕大關係矣。</p>
<p>在男子感染淋病時，淋菌最先侵入尿道，在女子則第一侵犯至膣腔與予宮，淋菌侵入膣腔之時，引起膣炎，侵入子宮之後，必引起子宮內膜炎與實質炎，凡此都足以造成不妊之原因，淋病又能使子宮位置變化，允爲不妊症之一絕大原因，他如淋菌自子宮而侵入喇叭管，發生喇叭管炎，變爲膿瘍，甚至喇叭管完全閉塞，則竟成爲一種絕對不妊症之原因，再進而至卵巢，引起卵巢炎，卵子之成熟，已爲妨碍，不能有排卵作用，自亦爲不妊症之一種，此外尚有一最大原因，女子得淋病後，常致不妊，因男子所射出之精虫，經含有淋菌之膣腔，其活動力已爲淋菌所滅，女子自是未能受孕，故女子之患淋病，若不治愈，必致妨碍生育，斷絕子嗣，其關係至鉅也。</p>
<p>女子淋病的治療，亦以愈早愈妙，允以未深入子宮時爲合時，在不就醫而行家庭療治時，則可用「淋毒舒樂耳」外用及「減殺淋」之內服，庶幾可瘳。</p>

<p>在現時社會，「神經衰弱」成爲極普遍的症候，患本病的人似乎很多，而且都是年靑者，本症發生的原因，除了幾種特殊的之外，大都是荒淫的結果，所謂異常的性生活所致，如房事過度及手淫等等是，所謂神經衰弱，就是神經系統現有刺激性衰弱的狀態，他的一般症狀，就是神經系極容易興奮，而且也極容易疲勞，同時可以發生生殖器的障碍或生殖病態，這都是因爲性生活之不合，傷耗過甚，體內的燐質和內分泌液缺乏，致全身組織的營養，不能充足，造成了神經衰弱症。本症可分爲三個時期，（一）局所性神經衰弱時間，（二）腰脊髓神經症時期，就是腰部的神經痛。（三）腦神經衰弱時期，已到了全身神經衰弱的時期。這三個時期的神經衰弱的症候，雖各各不同，但考究其源，都由於人身內分泌和燐質過分缺乏，致全體各部受影響，營養不良，致成了神經衰弱的各種病狀，所以對於神經衰弱的治療，最妥當的，便是補充身體內的燐質及內分泌液，關於是項藥物現時所賞用者，厥爲「安爾神」，同時須遵守醫師所指示的正當攝生，亦屬非常緊要</p>
<h3>濕疹之症狀及療法</h3>
<p>— 孫志耀</p>
<p>本症好發之部位，大抵在關節陰處，如大腿內側，陰囊左右周圍及上膊內側等，聞有散在四肢者。</p>
<p>發生本症時，通常先覺皮膚騷癢，灼熱，腫起，其决發生帽針頭大之邱疹，漸成水泡，他有例外，或破潰，或結軟痂，頑固難治。</p>
<p>致發本症之原因，大都爲皮膚不潔，寄生菌之感染，腺病性惡液質及血行障碍等，他如由於化學的溫熱的及器械的刺戟，如苦力勞作者最易罹期疾，也有由於貧血，萎黃病及糖尿病者，但甚罕見。</p>
<p>治療本症，大都着重局所療治，全身狀態，亦須注意，局所療法，最忌用酒精製劑之液體藥，因其有刺戟表皮剝離之部分，不但無效，反而有害，此時最好用軟膏劑或油劑，今日醫家所賞用者，厥惟皮膚病良藥「滅絕菌」諸凡撲滅皮膚細菌，助長皮膚抵抗力之藥物，此藥配合俱全，各種癬患，用之有效，殊不知對於濕疹，尤能迅速奏功。</p>
<h3>胃痛</h3>
<p>— 蔣國藩</p>
<p>本症發生之原因，大率爲急性胃加答兒，慢性胃加答兒，胃酸過多症，胃液漏及急劇的精神感動等，考此等症狀之內服藥物治療，厥惟亞爾加里劑是賴，蓋亞爾加里劑能中和胃酸，消炎，鎭痛，止吐及調節胃之機能，使之行正常運動，此種製劑，卽久服亦無所害，不若含有麻醉成分之止痛劑，有妨碍或影響身體之虞。此種製劑中現時所最賞用者，莫如「胃寳」，此藥係亞爾加里之精合的配製劑，舉凡　心嘔吐胃痛胃脹等一切胃之疾息，服之無不立應奇效，余臨床屢用之，因書實騐，以告抱斯病者。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>濟市舉辦災民運動會</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>讀報載濟南通訊云：「濟市為增進災民健康起見，擬乘春暖舉行災民運動會；現已決定於三月七日「南圩門外體育場舉行。全部計分成人，兒童、女子三組。所有各項運動節目，均切合鄉村實際活動。像個人競賽，成人有四百公尺負重競走，挑擔競走，推車競走；六百公尺搬運走，沙袋擲遠，掘坑比賽等。團體競賽有四百公尺二人抬運競走，八百公尺搬運八人接力等。女子個人競賽有百公尺滾球競走，穿針競走，縫袋競走，提籃競走……等等。個人前六名，團體四名，均獎贈現金…云云」</p>
<p>在這裏，對於濟市災民運動會舉辦，有幾點是值得我們給注意的：</p>
<p>一，誰都知道，在今日，老天竟派「災神」來給我們中國做了好朋友，水災，旱災，蟲災……等跟我們的農民大衆正結了個「不解之緣」。這樣，在災民們大家啃樹皮，吞「觀音」餓死，脹死之下，有一部災民，終於在政府當局與社會上的「大慈善家」們的賑災，救濟下，得苟喘着他們的殘命。允其是每到冬天，在各地「慈善家」們所舉辦的收容所，庇寒所，施粥廠等，正是災民們的「幸福安樂窩」呢！</p>
<p>然而，在那裏，我們的公子哥兒與小姐們卽使掩上了尊鼻，也不願踏進一步的收容所，庇寒所，對於設施方面的衛生，災民們的健康，是曾有過多大的注意呢？然而這在那些成千成萬鳩衣百結，污垢滿面的災民們，却正視之爲他們唯一的「安樂窩」而在那裹充塞着，生活着，雖然病魔老是在與他們交友，作伴！</p>
<p>所以，今日濟市當局的能顧及災民，「爲增進災民健康起見」而舉辦「災民運動會，這真可謂「空前創舉」（在其他國內，恐也未必有的吧？）</p>
<p>二，在我們這個私有財產制度的社會組織裹，「利」，「勢」，「名」，原是一般人所以生活着的「目的」。而運動也怎樣能例外呢？在學校，在健身房，在運動場，我們却曾經「光榮地」造成了幾個什麼王」，什麼「家」之外，有幾個能顧到所以運動的眞義呢？至於要拿運動而與我們的實生活配合起來，聯繫起來，‘那更可未曾有過吧？</p>
<p>然今日濟市當局，能以各項災民運動節目，來「切合鄉村實際活動」，那確是我們值得注意者之二。</p>
<p>不過，話又說回來啦，收容所終竟不能災民們的「永生之所」吧？然而，在今日到處鬧荒而整個農村經濟已經崩潰了的當兒，那裹還有農民大衆的「用武之地」呢？災民們的出路，往那兒去找呢？這在濟市當局，不知有注意了沒有？</p>
<h3>春之歌</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>「哪兒的春天，都一樣地浸在沉悶底圈子里，可是呀！我需要强烈底酒精，酒精可以使我噴出辛熱的氣燄，我需耍汜濫的狂濤，洗了到處都是一樣的沉悶。」</p>
<p>兩三年前，我天天地唱着這悒鬱的歌，這歌曾使我迸流過酸辛的苦汁，這歌曾使我忘記了自己的周圍。啊！周圍都是惡魔啊！張着狡滑的臉孔，睜着殘兇的眼睛，他們都向我譏笑，給我無限的苦難。</p>
<p>我愛自由啊，哪時，我張開了我底翅膀飛，悄悄地向着天空飛，我找尋烘熱的氣燄，我找尋美麗的靑天，可是啊，從天之南角，飛到嚴寒的北海，從洪濤的東海之濱，跑到西方那峻險的山嶺，！不論是明媚的晨光里，還是沉寂的黑夜，啊！曾使我遺忘了自己底苦難的長長的旅程呵！哪兒曾有美麗的春天呢？</p>
<p>「美麗的春天被惡魔噬去了！」</p>
<p>我失望地，壓着沉悶底心情，咒詛着，在鮮艷得處女的腓紅底臉似的陽光照着，在沉寂慘淡的黃昏里，我獨自地，太息地徘徊，可是啊，我不敢咒詛春天之神，我却要咒駡那險惡的魔鬼哪！</p>
<p>「魔鬼佔了這世界啊！魔鬼噬了人間的春天啊！」</p>
<p>遙長的旅程啊！使我深該地嘗到那毒汁了。！我愛艷麗的春天，我追求着光明，可是，那惡魔們在譏笑我，鄙視我：</p>
<p>「你要鏡子麼？像你這樣孱弱的人也渴望美麗的春天啊？」</p>
<p>是啊！牠們還舉着一桿槍，向我的胸膛錨準，他們當我憤怒地吼着，看着，我揮起了手，看着，我拚命地向着黑暗之角街進，他們就瘋了似地顫着着手，他們會恐嚇我：</p>
<p>「你要春天麼？看這桿槍錨準什麼地方呵！」</p>
<p>啊！那許多惡魔們，那許多不知恥的惡魔們在諷笑我呵！</p>
<p>難道，我永遠地屈服在佔有了春天的惡魔們底下嗎？</p>
<p>於是，我憤怒地狂呌，但是啊！我覺悟了我底周圍，和周圍以外，同情我的很多呢！他們也沒有美麗的春天，他們也被壓迫在不幸的圈子里，他們被浸在沉悶的酒精里啊！</p>
<p>「我們站在一起吧！沒有春天的人們呵！來呵！趕快呵！」</p>
<p>我狂暴地呌了起來，我喝着濃郁的酒，我迸着强烈的氣燄，我的眼睛却迸出紅色的光彩來了，我的全身在賽燒，我顫抖着，當惡魔們還佔有了我們的春天底時候，我的靈魂再不是孤獨，再不是悄悄地沉悶地去找尋美麗的春天了。</p>
<p>「哪兒的春天，都被浸在惡魔底毒汁里！可是呵！我們要偉大的洪流！衝洗了沉悶，迎着美麗的春天啊！」</p>
<p>兩三年的流浪之歌，如今呵，再不要唱了，我要啊這無數人的歌！眞正的自由的歌！啊！去找尋美麗的春天的歌，使我忘記了過去底悒鬱啊！</p>
<h3>瞎話</h3>
<p>— （吹）</p>
<p>七日路透電，德國今日宣佈不承認成立萊茵河爲不駐兵區域之洛迦諾公的後，卽派兵入萊茵地，此舉足使全歐震駭。譚老三曰，意阿戰事，方將告一段落，而德國又宣告廢止羅卡諾公約，重佔萊茵區域，歐洲一幕一幕好戲，表演出來，大有令人「靑龍頭上看相殺，山雨欲來風滿樓，」之戚。</p>
<p>日廣因拜受組閣大命後，爲軍部所不滿，幾至流產，後經與寺內會談結果，新閣可望成立。譚老三日，廣田素不贊成焦土政策者，今後不能不拋棄和平政策，而踏上焦土政策之路矣。</p>
<h3>長衫</h3>
<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>小毛爸，小毛爸，醒醒吧。老天呀，你眞的不會好了嗎？嗬嗬嗬……；，福順嫂淚臉糢糊，邊哭邊喊，眼睛死盯着病人的眼睛，嘴巴正對着病人的嘴巴。</p>
<p>「爸爸，爸爸，嗬嗬嗬……」小毛在母親旁邊發在似的頓着脚，眼淚像潮水。</p>
<p>前隣後舍的男男女女塞滿了窗口和門口，低說，歎息。大家都裝出一副怪哀傷的苦臉，像在說：沒有吃口飽，沒有着件煖，苦一輩子呀！」</p>
<p>踏在死的邊沿上的神志朦朧的福順，由於妻兒震裂人心的哭喊，微微睜開眼睛，一絲充滿溫情的生命的殘輝，像垂熄的油燈黯淡的光熖，無力地射在他們的淚臉上，雙唇微微模動，喉嚨裏響着糊的塞滿了痰似的聲音。</p>
<p>「小毛，不要哭吧。聽聽爸爸說什麼。」</p>
<p>母子倆竭力收住眼淚，忍住哽咽，兩隻右耳一齊凑到病人的唇邊，聚精會神地傾聽着。房內墳墓般的靜寂。</p>
<p>「長……衫，」</p>
<p>小毛開始打破了靜默：</p>
<p>「好像說長衫呀媽。」</p>
<p>福順嫂覺得有一把尖刀突然刺進自己的心，渾身痛得發抖，剛才勉强忍住的眼淚又像决堤的河水一樣泛濫出來，小毛又發在似的頓着脚。隣人們又不斷的低語，歎息，有幾個還用衣袖揩着自己濕潤的眼睛。</p>
<p>『苦命兄弟呀……嗬嗬嗬……』</p>
<p>福順嫂的心碎了。長衫，在丈夫心目中像那塊始終不肯出賣的出地一樣寳貴的竹布長衫！十幾年前他同她在紅氈毯上拜堂時穿的是這件長衫十幾年來上親落眷過年過節，求神拜佛時穿的也是這件長衫，在臥病期中念念不忘，時刻向她提起的是這件長衫，在這神志朦朧的臨死時刻變戀不捨的也是這件長衫。她記得有一年新年，丈夫在毛毛雨中從十里路外親眷家裏拜歲回來，身上的長衫不見了，只留着補滿補釘的粗布短袍。他一手提着裝着『回禮』的考籃，一手緊壓着胸頭，彷彿心頭病發作似的。『長衫呢』？她驚異地問。『走到半路天落雨，就脫了藏在這里』。他用眼睛指點着胸頭，一邊從粗布短袍的下沿塞進一隻手，掏出摺得好好的長衫。『毛毛雨礙什麼事？你眞是——』『做伴長衫不是容易的呀。女人家曉得什麼』！</p>
<p>『苦命的兄弟呀，嗬嗬嗬……』</p>
<p>苦痛和悲傷像電流一樣，立刻從福順嫂的哭喊中傳染得隣人們的深心，眼淚雨點似的從他們眼睛落下來。從福順嫂的口中，他們知道這件寳貝長衫放在當鋪裹好幾個月了，他們也知道福順老是忘不了這件長衫。『長衫不給我贖出來穿在身上，我死了眼睛也不會閉的』。這幾天福順時常這樣說，福順嫂告訴他們。他們從這件長衫聯想起福順一家的生活，又從他們的生活聯想起自己的生活，從他們的結局推想到自己的結局，他們不自覺地一齊衝到福順的牀前。。</p>
<p>『福順嫂，他此刻還在念着那件長衫嗎』？</p>
<p>『唉，窮人有什麼話說』！</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>福順嫂彷彿沒有聽見他們的話，儘</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>在拚死命地哭着，喊着，難忘的往事正像毒蛇一樣咬着她破碎的心。</p>
<p>幾月前的一個深夜，村長的鴉片打手阿福突然噗噗地敲進他們的房門，像有十萬火急的事。</p>
<p>『福順，村長先生呌你給他二兩貨色，錢過幾天給你』。</p>
<p>『老早完了呀。統統賣掉　穀吃在肚子裏了。一共不過五六兩東西』。</p>
<p>『想漲價吧？人家都說你還有』。</p>
<p>『笑話。窮人還想漲價嗎？給你看吧』。他連忙從櫥角裏拿出一隻裝過鴉片漿的　。</p>
<p>第二天，早晨，福順慢吞吞地從村長牀前回到家裏，眉頭緊縐，像有什麼大難要臨頭似的。</p>
<p>『小毛娘，一個難關。村長限我三日內繳清兩塊錢鴉片捐，不繳就發警察來』。</p>
<p>早飯後，福順背着一個包裹往二十里路外一個當舖的鎭上走，在這包裹裏：一頂夏布帳，一雙夏布口袋，幾套夏布衫，幾斤苧蔴綫，還有福順這件寶貝長衫。</p>
<p>『老天呀，窮人連一件長衫都穿不成呀！嗬嗬嗬……』</p>
<p>『爸爸，爸爸，嗬嗬嗬……』</p>
<p>福順的眼睛重又微微睜開，嘴唇却不再動了，喉嚨裏也不再響了，可是從小小的眼縫裏閃出來的比剛才更加微弱給生命的殘輝，仍在告訴人：『長衫不給我贖出來穿在身上，我死了眼睛也不會閉的』。</p>
<h3>飯局</h3>
<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>北方人吃大餅，南方人吃白米飯，外國人吃麵包。吃品雖有各種，吃法雖有不同，不過兩隻肩膀抬個頭的人，總有一張嘴張着要東西吃，却是古今中外一體的。可是「吃」的運用，似乎除了滿足食慾之外，還有其他更得重要的作用。這種作用是什麼，如果你能夠注意到都市中酒樓餐館的特別生意興隆的原因，一定就可以恍然大悟。</p>
<p>這已經成了一種習慣。如果要邀集幾個朋友或同事來商量一件什麼事，就非得先來個「酒酣耳熱」不可。卽使這件事是公事，並非私人的請托，似乎也總得先請一頓飯，說起話來才便當些。就是開什麼董事會或者歡迎名人籌募振欵之類，也都要在餐館裏舉行。至於要同　，那是更應該請飯。因為大人先生們是很忙的，今天南京，明天上海，要找也不容易找得着。只有送個帖子請吃飯，或者到了吃的時候，他不好意思來個電話說「謝謝」，却抽空來坐上三五分鐘。於是乎時機不可失，連忙把他拉至一旁，咬着耳朶說話。雖然這樣說了不免變做耳邊風，過上一年半載無消息，可是說總是說到的了。而且在朋友們面前說起來，「今天我請某老吃飯，某老如何如何……」，總至少有些光彩。</p>
<p>還有每逢寒暑假前學校裏的「瓊林宴」，那眞是要算最「懿歟盛哉」了。本來學生畢業，比不得學徒滿師，大可以不必請什麼酒。卽使要請，也只要學生請教師一次，教師學請學生一次就完了。可是不然，開始是合體畢業學生全體敎員，接着是全體敎員還請全體畢業學生；其次是各系畢業學生請各系敎員，接着是各系敎員還請各系畢業學生；再次是某某等高足請某某等恩師，接着是某某高等恩師還請某某高等高足。此外還有種種色色的花頭，鬧得「每飯必局」，大倒胃口。</p>

<h3>袁美雲成夜未寐</h3>
<p>— 雨林</p>
<p>一間西式的臥房，室中佈景極盡富麗，中間有大銅床，金光閃爍，燦爛輝煌，一見　知為新購置者，同時亦使人疑為誰家子媳之洞房耳。</p>
<p>未幾，王桂林偕袁美雲人，王顧為袁曰：「好孫子，還是你公公特地為你舖設的臥室，以後你可以跟公公睡在一起了」，袁聞言無以答，戚然似有無限心事也。王猶指四週佈設示之，欣然自得，中心快樂與袁適得其反。</p>
<p>王脫衣先睡，視袁猶屹立其間，乃催促曰：「快點來睡，明天一早公公還要帶你到鄉下去拜見幾位叔嬸啦！他們聽你要從南洋歸來都喜歡得了不得啊？」</p>
<p>袁躊躇不已，然終解衣就寢，但其忸怩不安之狀，有如餓虎之小羊。王初次見孫面，喜愛滿懷，極盡　犢，欲挾抱之於懷，惟袁因有秘密在身，終不能容納祖父之慈愛，中心苦衷，有非筆墨所能形容者，因此袁竟夜未成寐，且因此而演變啼笑皆非之一幕。</p>
<p>此乃藝華公司攝製，全部有聲鉅片「化身姑娘」之一段情節。袁美雲餘孫子，女扮男裝，有極良美之成績，尤以此幕中之演出，悉用內心表演，表情動作，均達爈火純青之境。至於飾祖父之王桂林，亦有極卓絕之演技。總之，此幕戲包含有無限的刺激性和神秘性，導演的優越手法，更能握住，每一個觀眾之心懷，而隨講劇情之展開，熱血如火一般鼎沸，情緒如波濤般翻騰。</p>
<h3>「雙城記」女主角伊麗莎白亞倫</h3>
<h3>國色天香中之醋潮</h3>
<p>「國色天香」聲片，不日在卡爾登公映，有見其試片者，一致稱為國產歌舞聲片中之唯一成功作。而導演但杜宇之技巧，亦盡於此片之中，最耐人尋味處，卽載歌載舞，花團錦簇中，男主角和女主角在化裝室發生醋潮，弄得哭聲盈室，將男主角驅逐出去，片刻間悲歡異致，能使觀眾情緒，驟然變換，非演員於平日有相當之修養，不易致此也。</p>
<h3>小姐不知夏</h3>
<p>「到自然去」——將軍之女美華小姐，（徐健飾）她穿件金絲繡花燦爛奪目的長衣，低著粉頸，垂著翠環，額前鬆散下幾縷青髪，倚在深綠色的絲絨長沙發懷裏，在試著她的象牙色的高跟鞋。</p>
<p>婢女微笑著捧進一束白蓮花來。</p>
<p>「小姐，您看這花兒！」</p>
<p>「怎麼夏天又來了嗎？」</p>
<p>「現在已經是五月啦。」</p>
<p>說著，婢女把白蓮花放在花瓶裏。</p>

<h3>Tianjin Customs and the Railway Bureau Jointly Strictly Investigate Tax-Evading Goods; Meticulous Liaison Strategies Have Been Discussed and Will Be Implemented Next Week; Smuggling in North China Affects Foreign Debt Interest and Principal Funds</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The tax revenue loss from tax-evading goods in North China from August last year to the present is between 5 million and 10 million, which is difficult for the Customs to calculate. The most prosperous time was in September and October last year, when North China was tense, and ronin openly transported goods, organized groups, held weapons to protect them, and forcibly loaded cars. The freight was resisted and not paid. Until last month, it was negotiated through the railway side, and Japanese military police escorted the cars, and less transportation was done, and freight was also paid. Customs is currently negotiating with the Bei-Ning Railway to decide on methods to prevent the increase of private transportation and strictly investigate at the Tianjin station, ordering the payment of taxes. Diplomatic relations will be handled by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Large foreign firms such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi in Tianjin are also dissatisfied with private transportation, believing that it affects regular commercial business and requesting Consul-General Kawagoe to assist our side in cracking down on it. Therefore, the Customs' strict crackdown on smuggling will not cause unexpected events. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to Tianjin Customs, there are concrete measures for anti-smuggling in North China. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council has ordered the Bei-Ning Railway to assist. Customs is discussing meticulous liaison strategies with the Railway Bureau, which was originally planned to be implemented this week, but due to insufficient preparation, it must be postponed to next week. In the future, before the Dongbei Autonomous Anti-Communist Government is abolished, the Customs will strictly investigate smuggled goods when they arrive in Tianjin. If untaxed goods are found, the railway will assist in detaining them. The Customs Supervision Department has also been ordered by the Hebei-Chahar Council to contact the Tianjin Office of the Jin-Pu Railway and request assistance to prevent the southward transportation of smuggled goods. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to Railway news, most smuggled goods are still transported through the Beidaihe coast. They are loaded onto small motorboats from Dalian and unloaded on the shore, using cars for connection, and then loaded onto cars at Liushouying and Changli. The goods are mostly sugar, jute, yarn, wool fabrics, and cotton yarn. Those transported by land are mostly through Yuguan. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Regarding the smuggling of Japanese rayon and wool fabrics to Tianjin and their transfer by train to the south, the Customs and railway authorities are currently discussing response measures. It is heard that in the future, imported goods transported from Tianjin to the south must present the Customs' tax payment certificate. Otherwise, we will prohibit the loading of trains. It is said that this method has been agreed upon by all parties and can be implemented within a week. However, there is still no solution to the smuggling trend between Yuguan, the coast, and Tianjin for the time being. It has been found that the smuggling of Japanese goods, in addition to direct import from outside Yuguan, is mostly loaded onto small boats from Dalian and imported into Qinhuangdao or small ports near Beidaihe, and then the goods are landed and transported to Tianjin and other places via the Bei-Ning Railway. (Eleventh Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Since the Japanese interfered with anti-smuggling in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, the central government's tax revenue in Hebei and Chahar, including Customs and salt taxes, has been greatly affected. According to sources familiar with the financial community, the revenue from Customs and salt taxes in Hebei and Chahar, in addition to being allocated to repay the principal and interest of foreign debts in peacetime, also had surplus funds for the military and political expenses of Hebei and Chahar. Now, due to rampant smuggling, tax revenue has been reduced, and if this continues, problems will inevitably arise in the fund for repaying foreign debt principal and interest. As for the consolidated tax, collection is even more difficult. In order to maintain international credit, the central government has ordered the Foreign, Finance, and Railway departments to carefully plan effective anti-smuggling measures in order to protect the rights of friendly countries in China.

<h3>Japanese Military Exercises in Yuguan</h3>

<h3>Resolutions of the Central Political Council; Approval to Issue the 25th Year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds; Approval of the Rules of Procedure for the Various Specialized Committees</h3>

(Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Through Transport Law for Goods Inside and Outside the Pass: 1. The through transport of goods is limited to the lines of the China National Bei-Ning Railway and the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the lines of the General Railway Bureau outside the pass. The names of the stations that handle various through transport goods will be announced by both parties in accordance with past procedures. 2.

<h3>First Drafts of the Two National Assembly Laws; Lin Bin and Others Hold a Meeting to Study</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Lin Bin and other members of the Legislative Yuan who are drafting the first drafts of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Election and Recall Law held a meeting at the Yuan on the eleventh, continuing to study the points in the principles of the two laws promulgated by the Central Government that should be resolved first. It is heard that the most difficult problem encountered during the drafting of the two laws is the number of representatives, and how it should be allocated. Because the principles promulgated by the Central Government, in addition to the number of military representatives being clearly set at 20 to 30, only made general regulations for the rest. How many representatives should be allocated to each province, city, and overseas professional group? How should the number of representatives for overseas Chinese and border areas be allocated? After repeated exchanges of views with the Five Committees and the Ministries of Internal Affairs and Industry, as well as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, there are already some clues, which still need to be reported to President Sun and convener Fu Bingchang before the articles can be drafted.

<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Finance previously planned to collect traffic surcharges to raise huge amounts of money for water conservancy purposes. The Executive Yuan transferred it to the Finance, Transportation, and Railway departments for review. As a result, collecting traffic surcharges would hinder the transportation business, considering the past and present situation. The surcharges would inevitably hinder business development. As for the Customs surcharge, the simultaneous collection of import and export goods would greatly affect domestic industry and commerce. It is requested that the Ministry of Finance conduct careful planning. The Ministry of Transportation stated that since the 21st year, the stamp duty has been increased from 2 cents to 5 cents. In addition, the postal service in the three northeastern provinces has been suspended, and the number of letters has suddenly decreased by 80 million compared to the previous year. If the surcharge is based on stamps, it is equivalent to increasing the burden and is actually not worth the loss. In recent years, the economy has been declining, and ordinary letters at 5 cents are already expensive. The people really do not have the ability to increase the burden. Communication has never been profitable. If the surcharge must be collected based on stamps, it is feared that the number cannot be accurately calculated. As for express mail, the surcharge collected is minimal, but the procedures are cumbersome, which hinders the speed. As for ordinary mail, adding one cent to the price of each letter, except for international and special mail, accounts for 10% of domestic letters, 25% of local letters, and 3% of express registered letters. The collection is only a few thousand yuan per month. After deducting the donation yarn printing fee, paper and the cost of reference books and manpower, the income is limited. As for telegrams and telephones, international telecommunications are related to conventions, and it is not convenient to add surcharges. For domestic telegrams, if short messages are charged a uniform fee, the procedures are cumbersome, and the monthly surcharge is estimated to be no more than 21,000 yuan. The rental fee for city telephones has also recently increased slightly, so it is not convenient to collect surcharges to avoid increasing the burden on users. There are not many state-owned telephones, and collecting surcharges is prone to disputes. The Ministry of Railways' opinion is that the Fourth Plenary Session resolved to cancel railway surcharges. The Executive Yuan has rejected requests from various provinces to collect road surcharges due to floods. If traffic surcharges are collected, it is considered a violation of the law in the railway aspect. Passenger and freight prices have adopted a policy of reduction. If a 3% surcharge is added, it is contrary to the usual policy. At this time of economic decline, it is appropriate to use waste price transportation to facilitate the circulation of domestic products. Those who transport goods out of the river can also use lower freight rates to reduce costs and compete in foreign markets. It is not appropriate to increase freight rates, which will harm both goods and production, and railway revenue will also be affected. Also, the Jinghu, Hubi, Yongjiao, Longhai, and Hainanning Railways are heavily indebted to foreign countries. If a surcharge is added, it is feared that the price rights will affect road revenue and cause disputes, making it difficult to implement. It is agreed, but in order to protect the interests of the price rights, it will not be allowed to be used for other purposes. The Beiping-Suiyuan, Yuehan Southern Section, and Guangjiu Fourth Road are also extremely difficult. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>In Memory of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Death Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>It has been eleven years since Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away. He was the most respected revolutionary by all of our compatriots. His great spirit and his immortal achievements for the Chinese nation compel us to deeply commemorate him on this day of remembrance. Mr. Sun Yat-sen toiled tirelessly for the revolution throughout his life, one could almost say he never enjoyed a single day of comfort. However, this spirit of hard work ultimately reaped immense rewards after his death. He not only became a great man of China but also a great man of the world. His profound and extensive revolutionary ideology, which even influenced the world, was composed of two elements. The first is the spirit of altruistic and selfless universal love, and from this root sprouted a strong animosity towards imperialism and feudal forces. The second is the deepest and broadest understanding of the situation in China and the world. Needless to say, this came from his tireless research based on his extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's early thoughts and efforts overthrew the Manchu Qing government and created the Republic of China. However, after the founding of the Republic, this great revolutionary felt disappointed. He continued to work and study for the revolution, eventually producing the invaluable doctrines of the Three Principles of the People and the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction for our nation. Although these two works, which laid the foundation for China's current politics, were only published in his later years, their essence had already taken shape in the early years of the Republic. At that time, the Chinese nation had only gained partial liberation from the first revolution, but was suffering from the deepening oppression of the Northern Warlords and imperialism. During the third and fourth years of the Republic, Japan took advantage of the opportunity of the European War to implement its terrifying continental policy. It occupied Qingdao and the Jiaoji Railway, and further used force to pressure China to recognize the Twenty-One Demands. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's understanding of the international situation and the way out for the Chinese nation could not have been more thorough. In March of the fourth year, he said in a notice to the Chinese Revolutionary Party, "If we hold fast to the revolutionary righteousness and proceed with unity, then we can speak of realizing internal peace and resisting external aggression. We can take the past as an example and evidence. In the late years of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Lushun, Dalian, and Jiaozhou Bay were sliced and divided. The Yangtze River, the three northeastern provinces, Fujian, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi were designated as spheres of influence for foreigners. The most ignorant people invariably said that revolution was impossible, that revolution would invite dismemberment. We forcefully refuted this. Our refutation was successful, and the revolutionary thought swelled day by day. The revolution suddenly arrived, and all countries watched from the sidelines and dared not move. In the years that followed, wherever revolutionaries held the reins of power, foreigners did not dare to lightly insult... It can be seen that only our party can use genuine popular sentiment to defend the country. Yuan Shikai followed the old ways of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in everything, so how could he not follow in the footsteps of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in diplomacy? Therefore, revolution is precisely for saving the country, not empty talk."</p>
<p>Needless to say, the specific doctrines and political programs later published by Mr. Sun Yat-sen were elaborations of this basic revolutionary theory. Needless to say, the progress of the National Revolution and the eventual completion of the Northern Expedition were the result of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and his followers constantly and tirelessly inspiring popular sentiment with this theory.</p>
<p>Today, on the anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the reason we specifically extract those few sentences from his notice is because China's position in today's international situation is somewhat similar to that during the European War. Japan's continental policy, after a period of obstruction by British and American forces, has resurfaced since the September 18th Incident. Although the great war has not yet broken out, the latent crisis has already made the great powers preoccupied with their own affairs. This kind of international situation clearly stimulates the deepening ambition of Japanese soldiers towards China, no different from the period of the European War. Facing such a serious national crisis, we cannot help but feel that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's accurate and unwavering proposition of "revolution to save the country" still needs to be implemented with the greatest effort. We know that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was not only a great politician but, more importantly, he was also a great revolutionary. He said that the Kuomintang he created was not really a political party but a revolutionary party. We also know that revolution has a greater goal than just obtaining political power, which has not yet been achieved. However, we can now take solace in the fact that our government is far from comparable to the Yuan Shikai era. Our government leaders hold the determination to inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. They should not forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen's warning, "The revolution has not yet succeeded." When dealing with national crises, they will, of course, firmly adhere to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's last will.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates for Two Days, Defense White Paper Finally Passed, Chancellor of the Exchequer Claims Funding is Not a Problem, Churchill Details Germany's Armament Situation</h3>
<p>The House of Commons in London continued to debate the Defense White Paper today. The focus of the discussion was the restoration of Germany's military. As a result, after rejecting the Labour Party's amendment by a vote of 378 to 155, the House of Commons passed the Defense White Paper by a vote of 371 to 153.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain delivered a concluding speech before the vote, confirming that the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact and the League of Nations Administrative Council would both meet in London. He also announced that the Committee of Thirteen, originally scheduled to meet in Geneva on March 11, had been postponed until next week. Chamberlain stated that the events of the past week had confirmed the White Paper's statement that the situation was not fixed and that methods needed to be changed at any time. Some have said that the British government only pays lip service to collective security, but this is not the case. Collective security has already cost Britain seven million pounds, and it still pays about 500,000 pounds a month for it. If the House of Commons decides that the government's proposed measures are necessary for security and fulfilling the obligations of the League of Nations, then the country will definitely be able to raise the necessary funds without any problems.</p>
<p>During the debate, Churchill delivered a lengthy speech dedicated to describing the situation in Germany. He said that even if the German government is extremely fond of peace, it finds itself in a dilemma. If it moves forward, bankruptcy is a concern; if it stops, unemployment will inevitably increase. In this regard, the German government will soon tend toward one of the following two paths: either internal strife or external trouble. Can we not doubt which path the German leaders will take? We have heard that Germany is not yet prepared for war, and some have said that Germany is only half-prepared. However, we have witnessed that Germany is the only European country that is not afraid of war. What we have seen in the past few days is a semi-armed German form. Just think about what the situation will be like when its vast preparations are nearing completion. Wars often break out before all the combatants are fully prepared. I fear that the history of European armaments will eventually reach a breaking point. Although I cannot determine the date, I am sure that this day will come during this parliamentary term. This day may pass peacefully. We should not accept the theory that war is inevitable, but we must not close our eyes to the cruel progress of events. I have previously said that Germany directly or indirectly used more than 300 million pounds for armaments in 1935. I have financial statistics that can show how Germany secretly found this money from its financiers. In the three years after Hitler came to power, Germany used a total of 150 million pounds. This money was borrowed from within the country, and its source of funds had long been mortgaged, some even borrowed four years in advance. Assuming the number is only 60 million pounds, we will also encounter events with incalculable impact. Millions of previously unemployed people in Germany have found work in arms factories or have enlisted in the army.</p>
<p>Its financial situation has now reached a point where it cannot continue in this way. The German Air Force still surpasses the British Air Force. Britain should deploy more destroyer fleets to defend against submarine threats. According to Churchill's opinion, the plans outlined in the White Paper are still insufficient. Comparing Germany's industrial preparations with those of Britain, he argued that the British government should create a separate munitions department. The statement in the White Paper that the regular army and the territorial army cannot simultaneously improve their equipment is clear evidence that British industry has not yet been reorganized to adapt to the situation.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister George spoke, agreeing with Churchill on the importance of the destroyer fleet, but disagreeing with Churchill's assessment of German military power. He said that we are not currently without defense. The navy is invincible. If we adopt appropriate methods, we can get the same correct protection in other areas. Compared with 1914, Germany now has no allies. I believe that Germany will not act foolishly and confront the military power combined by collective security. Therefore, I believe Germany's proposal for a twenty-five-year non-aggression pact.</p>
<p>Home Secretary Simon also spoke, saying that the British Empire Defense Committee is chaired by the Prime Minister, with several sub-committees attached, and the Chiefs of Staff Committee is one of them. This is a peacetime system, and it is appropriate to exercise its functions in peacetime. But in the era we are now experiencing, this system really needs to increase its strength and expand its scope. What we are encountering today is a more difficult and urgent era. If unfortunately war breaks out one day, then we must have more continuous contact and faster cooperation. If the measures in the White Paper are approved by Congress, the extreme difficulties in extremely important work can be quickly eliminated. The situation requires constant attention. In the government's opinion, the agency for handling defense affairs must now have some expansion. The government has determined that the best way is to establish a commissioner to exercise special powers as the full-time chairman of the Empire Defense Committee to handle the important duties outlined in the White Paper.

<h3>Japan Watches the Future Development of the European Situation, Expressing Sympathy for Germany's Actions</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding Germany's action to abolish the Locarno Treaty, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reports from the ambassadors to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy on the 11th, all pointing out the seriousness of the matter. It is said that the German army's occupation of the demilitarized Rhineland is directly caused by the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. However, although Japan is a member of the Treaty of Versailles, it has not joined the Locarno Agreement. No related country should ask Japan for assistance. However, the Japanese government believes that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is limited to Europe and has nothing to do with the Far East. Although it has stated this intention, the recent words and deeds of the Soviet Union have adopted an offensive posture towards Japan, with a strong attitude of monitoring and containing. Therefore, although Germany's decisive action did not make any explanations, the development of the situation is worth paying attention to. (Eleventh Allied Dispatch)</p>

In addition, Wilcox's proposal also includes six air force bases that can be built later, with the locations suggested by the Army Department. Representative Parker, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, claimed that he plans to go to Alaska this summer to study the air defense problems there. It is said that the Army's air defense plan and the Navy's plan are quite compatible. (Tenth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Famous British Naval General, Lord Beatty, Dies, Participated in the Bombardment of Dagu Forts, Defeated German Fleet in the North Sea During the European War</h3>
<p>London: Lord Beatty, a famous British naval general and admiral of the fleet, died of illness today at the age of sixty-five. Beatty participated in the bombardment of the Dagu Forts during the Boxer Rebellion in China. During the European War, he fought the German fleet in the North Sea in 1916 and made outstanding achievements. Later, he accepted the surrender of the entire German fleet, but the Germans scuttled the ships themselves. In 1919, the British Parliament allocated 100,000 pounds to reward his meritorious service and promoted him to Earl. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Issue of Russian Troops Passing Through, Romania and Russia Have Not Started Negotiations, Romanian Foreign Minister Answers Questions from Parliamentarians</h3>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian Chamber of Deputies met today. The leader of the Independent Liberal Party, Bra Shiano, raised questions to the government, saying that there are foreign rumors that a Russo-Romanian Mutual Assistance Treaty is about to be concluded. It is unknown whether this is true. Bra Shiano also expressed the opinion that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Romania should be modeled after the current relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, and conclude a non-aggression treaty, and stipulate that "Soviet Russian troops are not allowed to pass through under any circumstances." According to reports, Bra Shiano asked the Foreign Minister Tidurescu the same question in December last year. Tidurescu replied that no negotiations have been conducted regarding the passage of Soviet Russian troops through Romania. (Eleventh Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tokyo Continues Martial Law, to Be Lifted at the End of This Month, Coup Suspects Being Hunted</h3>
<p>The martial law declared after the February 26th Incident in Nanjing seems to be maintained until the end of this month, largely because the authorities are still hunting for civil servants suspected of participating in the case. A total of one hundred and fifty such civil servants have been detained and are currently under investigation. Troops are still guarding administrative provinces, government offices, and key points. However, all normal activities in the capital have absolutely not been hindered. At the same time, according to the official gazette, the officers who were involved in the riot were opened for trial by the military tribunal on March 5. Samson, a British journalist and author who was detained on March 28 for speaking carelessly at the Imperial Hotel, was charged by the authorities with propagating opposition to martial law to tourists. He is still in custody, largely until the martial law is lifted before he can be released. Although the British consul has tried his best to intercede for him, it cannot take effect due to martial law. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Meeting Moves Location, Focus of European Situation Shifts to London, Locarno Signatories Meet Again Today, France Insists International Treaties Must Be Respected</h3>
<p>Paris: Representatives of the Locarno Pact signatory countries held their second meeting at the French Foreign Ministry last night. It started at 7:40 and ended at 8:12. According to the announcement after the meeting, it has been decided that the representatives of the Locarno Pact signatory countries will continue to meet in London on Thursday, and the League of Nations Administrative Council will also meet in London on Saturday. Therefore, in the next few days, London will be the focus of attention for those concerned about the overall European situation. British Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax will fly back to London this morning to continue discussing various matters with the government. It is heard that France is very happy that Britain has invited the discussion of Locarno Pact issue in London. This proposal came from Eden and Halifax, after seeking instructions from British Prime Minister Baldwin, his telegram of approval was received before the second meeting at the French Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>The results of this morning's meeting of representatives of the Locarno Pact signatory countries made everyone feel more aware of the seriousness of Germany's actions. It is heard that France firmly insists that Germany must first withdraw its troops before negotiations can be held on concluding a non-aggression and air pact to replace the Locarno Pact, even a "symbolic" withdrawal is what France wants. What is particularly emphasized by everyone is that the security of Belgium is tied to the demilitarized zone, even more so than France. Germany accuses France of concluding a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union in violation of the Locarno Pact, but this cannot be blamed on Belgium. Yesterday's meetings of representatives of the Locarno Pact signatory and guarantor countries were chaired by French Foreign Minister Flandin. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: It is heard that the reason why the League of Nations Administrative Council changed its meeting location to London is because British public opinion is still very calm. Therefore, everyone believes that meeting in London will definitely help this difficult negotiation. Moreover, the transportation between London and Berlin is also more convenient than between Geneva and Berlin. This is the first time that the League of Nations Administrative Council has met in London since 1922. The impression of people here is that Britain's invitation to representatives of various countries to meet in London is mostly due to French Foreign Minister Flandin giving Prime Minister Chillon a detailed explanation of the problems facing the League of Nations and the dangers to peace. British Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax were deeply moved by the words, so they advocated changing the meeting location to London, so that British Prime Minister Baldwin and his cabinet members could all listen to this discussion. Eden's move was also to avoid repeating the mistakes of former Foreign Secretary Hoare after his talks in Paris. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rumors of France's Concessions to Germany</p>
<p>Paris: At the Locarno Pact Conference this morning, Eden achieved the greatest success of his life, that is, he made France make the following two concessions: 1. Flandin guarantees that France will not take military action against Germany. 2. France conditionally guarantees that it will no longer insist that negotiations on the Locarno Pact can only proceed after the withdrawal of German troops. The condition for the second point is that Germany guarantees not to rebuild fortifications in the Rhineland area, and Hitler revises his proposal to return to the League of Nations and the Air Pact. (Tenth National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources, the minimum that France can accept is that Germany signs a pact guaranteed by Britain and Italy, stipulating that Germany cannot build defense works in the Rhineland area. It is expected that France will invoke the resolution of the League of Nations on April 4, 1935, which condemns unilateral violation of treaties and imposes economic and financial sanctions. France is now willing to rely on the sincere assistance of the guarantor countries, and is even willing to take military plans for this. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris' Denial</p>
<p>Paris: It is heard that France now argues that if the treaties on which the collective security system is based prove to be invalid, it intends to withdraw from the League of Nations. Several other countries have informed France that they also have the same intention. However, France intends to first exhaust all the possibilities provided by the Locarno Pact and the League of Nations Covenant in order to obtain satisfaction regarding the German military's reoccupation of the Rhineland. Reports that France can accept Hitler's proposed methods of resolving the crisis, that is, limiting the number of soldiers in the Rhineland and not building defense works in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, have been firmly denied by the French government in a public statement today. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Italy Still Has Not Made Its Attitude Clear</p>
<p>Rome: Although Italy participated in the meeting at the French Foreign Ministry yesterday to discuss Germany's breach of the Locarno Treaty, Italy's attitude has not yet been formally announced in a clear document by the authorities. However, Italy's position is now expressed by Italian newspapers using sarcastic remarks about Britain and France. For example, the Standard newspaper said that London and Paris are now talking about Italy's status as a Locarno Pact signatory, but they do not know that Italy is now a country excluded by them and has long been ignored.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Invites Germany to Send Representatives to Participate</h3>
<p>Ribbentrop to Represent at the Meeting, Committee of Thirteen Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>Geneva: The Secretariat of the League of Nations announced today that the League of Nations Administrative Council will meet in London on Saturday, and notified that the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen, originally scheduled to be held on Wednesday, will be postponed indefinitely. The Committee of Thirteen planned to discuss the replies of Italy and Afghanistan regarding the mediation of the East African War. Well-informed observers said that since France insists that the League of Nations temporarily shelve the Italo-Afghan dispute, Britain cannot refuse. It is understood that if Germany is allowed to station troops in the Rhineland area, then it may also demand to rebuild defense works between the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus straits. The League of Nations was shocked by this and is very anxious about the general situation. (Tenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations Yu Administrative Council has decided to change the meeting to London on the 14th, that is, Saturday, and issued notices separately to Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi, and Romanian Foreign Minister Tidulou Sge. (Eleventh Havas)</p>
<p>London: After the League of Nations Administrative Council decided to hold a meeting on the 13th of this month to discuss the problem of Germany's abrogation of the treaty, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Irving Noah, asked Germany whether it could send representatives to attend at that time. Regarding this matter, according to sources in Berlin, people in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocate that representatives should be sent immediately, but the subordinates of the leader Hitler insist on dissenting opinions. Generally speaking, if Germany does accept the invitation to attend, then the representative will be Ribbentrop, the former special envoy for disarmament issues. It is heard that Ribbentrop had dissenting opinions before Germany abolished the Locarno Pact and immediately marched into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, but was not adopted by the leader Hitler.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden Leaves Paris to Return to London, Attend Regularly Scheduled Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax were originally scheduled to take a plane from Paris back to London this morning, but were blocked by fog, so they changed to taking a train back home. The cabinet will hold a regular meeting today. After Eden returns, it will hold another meeting immediately. The difficulty of the negotiations in the next few days lies in how to reconcile France's proposal that negotiations cannot be held unless German troops withdraw from the Rhineland, with Britain's desire to negotiate. The British in Paris believe that France's attitude is now gradually easing. The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on Saturday may invite Germany to participate, but there is no certainty whether Germany will attend, because Germany has adopted an attitude of avoiding direct contact with the League of Nations as much as possible since withdrawing from the League of Nations.

<h3>Signatory Countries' Paris Conference: No Concrete Resolutions; Anglo-French Views Gradually Converging</h3>
<p>London (Reliable Sources) - At the meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries held in Paris today, the four participating countries, England, France, Italy, and Belgium, merely exchanged views without reaching any decisions. According to informed sources, France convened the meeting to seek possible ways to establish a new treaty to replace the Locarno Treaty. However, Britain believes that Foreign Secretary Eden's clear statement in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that if France and Belgium were attacked, Britain would certainly provide assistance as stipulated by the Locarno Treaty, provides a sufficient guarantee for France and Belgium, and no further action is necessary. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - British officials in Paris recently stated to our correspondent that Britain fully understands France's views on Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty. Reports stating that there are differences between British and French views are untrue. They added that British Foreign Secretary Eden's decision to come to Paris to attend the meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries was solely to ascertain France's position and not to take any decisions. Therefore, after understanding France's intentions, he felt it necessary to return and report to the British Cabinet to provide France with a concrete response. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>France Insists on Withdrawal of Troops Before Negotiations; Britain Willing to Act as Mediator</h3>
<p>Paris - According to sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding Germany's unilateral act of abrogation, the current focus of study is the principle of sanctions against Germany. However, specific sanction measures have not yet been discussed. It is generally believed that negotiations with Germany should be conditional on the withdrawal of German troops from the Rhineland. The League of Nations Executive Council alone has the authority to decide what steps to take to achieve this withdrawal. The current difference between British and French views lies in whether to accept the proposals made by German Chancellor Hitler. While Britain agrees that Germany's actions should be condemned, it believes that it may be possible to consider negotiating with Germany directly without first demanding troop withdrawal, which France strongly opposes. As for this country, although it believes that the mutual assistance clauses in the Locarno Treaty must be implemented, its attitude seems to be one of compromise between Britain and France. Furthermore, Italy cannot participate in sanctions against Germany at this time and is therefore taking the position of an observer. Regarding this, it is generally believed that the joint efforts of the Locarno Treaty signatory countries against Germany and the resolution of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute cannot be separated and should be closely linked (meaning the Italo-Ethiopian dispute should be resolved immediately so that Italy can participate in sanctions against Germany). (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - L'Intransigeant recently reported that Germany is showing signs of compromise on the Locarno Treaty issue. Britain has proposed to France that if Germany accepts the following measures, France does not need to insist on the withdrawal of German troops from the Rhineland area and can begin negotiations with Germany. These measures are: Germany promises not to build defensive fortifications in the Rhineland; Germany rejoins the League of Nations without significant conditions; and Germany signs an air pact with arms limitation clauses. The newspaper also stated that the League of Nations Executive Council meeting has now been moved to London, and Germany will send Ribbentrop as an observer to make contact. Britain is acting as a mediator for Germany, hoping to reduce criticism from all sides and find a way that all members of the Executive Council can accept as a basis for negotiations. The British government believes that the task of the League of Nations Executive Council is to maintain security and should focus on achieving peace and stability. The newspaper finally stated that according to reliable sources, former British Air Minister Lord Londonderry visited Germany last month to attend the Olympic Winter Games. During his visit to Berlin, he met with Chancellor Hitler, who secretly told Londonderry that the re-fortification of the Rhineland would materialize in March of this year. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Little Entente Form Anti-German United Front: Negotiations with Germany Equate to Rewarding Aggression; Urge League of Nations to Impose Strict Sanctions</h3>
<p>London - Soviet Russian Ambassador to Britain Maisky told Foreign Office Under-Secretary Cranborne today that the Soviet Union firmly opposes negotiating with Germany on the Locarno Treaty issue but is prepared to actively participate in any League of Nations plan. Soviet Russian Ambassador to France Potemkin also informed French Foreign Minister Flandin in the same way. This move indicates that Russia, France, the Little Entente, Turkey, and other countries will form a united front. During the talks, it was stated that negotiating with Germany equates to rewarding aggression, and the Soviet Union believes that this move will deal a fatal blow to the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London - British Foreign Office officials feel uneasy about the future situation of the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. This is because Soviet Ambassador Maisky has already informed Foreign Office official Lord Cranborne of his country's views, which are sufficient to represent the attitude of the countries of the Little Entente. If so, when the Executive Council meets, apart from the representatives of Britain and the Scandinavian countries, other countries may form a group and insist on dealing with Germany with the firmest attitude. This is the source of Britain's unease. Previously, when the League of Nations discussed the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the countries of the Little Entente supported Britain's proposal to impose sanctions on Italy. Their intention was to prevent Germany from taking actions that would violate the treaty and to nip future troubles in the bud, using this issue as a warning. Unexpectedly, Germany still abrogated the Locarno Treaty. Therefore, the countries of the Little Entente are now demanding sanctions against Germany. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Declares No Intention of Aggression Against France; Remarks to British Reporter Offer Explanation for Peace Proposals</h3>
<p>London - Today's Daily Mail reports on an interview its reporter, Birley, had with Hitler in Munich. Hitler stated that his proposal to conclude non-aggression treaties with neighboring countries is general, and the Czech Republic and Austria are also included. It would be more effective for all treaties to be negotiated directly by the countries involved. Germany on one side, France and Belgium on one side, or even including the Netherlands on one side. These countries should negotiate, and England and Italy should be invited to act as guarantors. It would be beneficial if the countries to be guaranteed by the treaty first discussed the matter with their future guarantors. The same applies to the non-aggression pact. It is possible to negotiate directly with other neighboring countries. If other countries, such as Britain, can act as honest mediators and propose practical solutions to these three matters, Germany would welcome them. The German government will not continue to take action to change the current situation. There is no reason to set a time limit for this proposal. However, if this proposal is rejected or ignored, the German government will not continue to make suggestions to urge Europe. Germany has no intention of aggression against France. However, in view of the Franco-Russian military alliance violating the spirit and letter of the Locarno Treaty, it cannot allow a densely populated and economically valuable border area to be without troops. Establishing an unarmed zone on a reciprocal basis is the best solution. If he had first proposed this and attached a request for the restoration of sovereignty over the demilitarized zone, the proposal would surely have won world approval. However, he believes that if this were the case, this proposal could not be brought to the conference table. British and French politicians must realize that their countries are in a state of crisis as he does, and they must also take this path. If Germany's proposals are accepted by all countries, it will greatly benefit European peace. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Rumors of Arita's Transfer to Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Nanjing - The Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new cabinet is currently being served concurrently by Prime Minister Hirota.

Therefore, a dedicated Foreign Minister will be appointed before the opening of the special Diet session. The candidates for the dedicated Foreign Minister are Arita, the Ambassador to China, Nagai, the former Ambassador to Germany, and Matsuoka Yosuke, but the rumor of Ambassador Arita's appointment as Foreign Minister is the strongest. If Ambassador Arita decides to take office as a dedicated Foreign Minister, then the replacement of the Ambassador to China will definitely be Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru, and this opportunity will be used to thoroughly overhaul the long-standing personnel issues of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<h3>The Reasons for the Decline of Chinese Rural Areas (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zou Shuwen, Dean of the Agricultural College of National Central University</p>
<p>In addition, there are two kinds of inhuman disasters: one is the rise and fall of civil war, and the other is the spread of the Communist bandits. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, there has not been a single year without civil war. Every time there is a civil war, farmers are always the first to suffer. In the rural areas within the war zones, it is inevitable that old and weak people will die in ditches, and the strong will be forced to take risks. The fields are left uncultivated and desolate. In the rural areas outside the war zones, people are exhausted because of conscription and grain requisition, and they cannot live and work in peace. As for the areas where the Communist bandits spread, property was looted, houses were turned into ruins, creating a red terror and destroying social stability. The impact of this naturally plunged the rural areas into deeper water.</p>
<p>In short, the reasons for the decline of our Chinese rural areas are due to the strong oppression of imperialism and miscellaneous taxes from the outside, the weakness of the rural areas themselves from the inside, and the impact of natural and man-made disasters. This is something no one can deny.</p>
<p>My Personal Views on the Reasons for Rural Decline and Their Remedies</p>
<p>What was said above is a general view. I personally agree with this viewpoint, of course, but I have slightly different insights. I think that in order to seek remedies for the decline of rural areas, it is not enough to simply list several unrelated reasons. We need to see clearly the interrelationships between various factors and their relationships with foreign countries. We need to see clearly the interrelationships between agriculture, industry, commerce, and everything else, as well as the role of the psychology of farmers. Only then can we prescribe the right medicine and carry out the work of revitalizing the rural areas.</p>
<p>The Interrelationships Between Various Regions  Let us tentatively divide the country into regions north of the Yellow River, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the coastal provinces in the south. The area north of the Yellow River has close ties with the northeast provinces and also with Inner and Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang. Since the fall of the four northeastern provinces, farmers in nearby provinces have lost many opportunities to go to Guanwai (Manchuria) every year. Even if a small number of people go there, they cannot freely obtain benefits as before. Furthermore, regarding the relationship with Outer Mongolia, since the Zhangjiakou-Kyaktu trade route was blocked, the business in Zhangjiakou has obviously declined. Since the business in Zhangjiakou has declined, the impact on goods from other regions can be imagined. Xinjiang Province is a very large place. Since the completion of the Siberian Railway, transportation to Russia has become more convenient, but transportation to China has become more inconvenient. The above-mentioned areas, which are adjacent to our country, have become foreign lands. The outflow of agricultural products and the migration of farmers are lacking outlets, and the losses suffered cannot be statistically determined. It is not necessary to make statistics, because it is possible to know that the losses are extremely large.</p>
<p>The people of southern Zhejiang, Fujian, and coastal Guangdong have always been the best in the country at seeking overseas development. The funds remitted back to China by overseas Chinese every year are counted in the tens of millions. Recently, due to the global economic panic, overseas Chinese merchants have failed, and various places have severely suppressed overseas Chinese. Not only are overseas Chinese unable to remit money back to China, but they are often unable to gain a foothold abroad. These tangible and intangible losses are also incalculable.</p>
<p>The lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal provinces are easily accessible to foreign trade. The goods of our country are severely threatened by foreign goods. This cannot be entirely blamed on unequal treaties, but it is also because the organization of the transportation and sale of our country's goods is incomplete, so we cannot help but fail in commercial warfare. Sichuan Province, in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, is rich in resources. It has an endless supply of goods that can be sold to various places, and the purchasing power of the people is also very high. However, with years of civil war, the economic losses are incalculable. The nearby provinces are greatly affected, and Qinghai and Xikang (eastern Tibet) seem to have broken off commercial relations with our country. In addition, in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, etc., where transportation is inconvenient, it has become even more inconvenient due to banditry and internal turmoil. Proper goods are difficult to transport because they are bulky, and only opium is small in quantity but high in price. Therefore, not only do warlords force cultivation, but farmers also tend to cultivate poppies due to natural trends. Every additional mu of opium not only adds a mu of poison, but of course also reduces a mu of proper agricultural production.</p>
<p>The above regional divisions are not entirely clear-cut, but they are intended to show the interrelationships between the various regions. To save the rural areas, we must plan for the adjustment of the national economy. We must strive to ensure that traditional agricultural products continue to sell well. Furthermore, due to changes in the times and the environment, various rural productions should be improved and the relationship between supply and demand adjusted. It is impossible to stand still, in order to achieve the goal of revitalizing the rural areas.</p>
<p>The Interrelationships Between Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, and Everything Else  I have repeatedly written articles to explain that to save the rural areas, one cannot only see the rural areas and not see other things, because the rural areas are closely related to other places. Most industrial raw materials are agricultural products. Especially in places where heavy industry is not developed, agricultural products naturally account for the absolute majority of industrial raw materials. Agricultural products must meet the needs of the times, and must be supplied in large quantities with consistent grades. In recent years, only silk and cotton have grading and inspection, but ideal implementation is still far away. All of our products should have a certain unmistakable grade, so that large quantities of supply can meet the applications of modern industry and the sales of modern commerce. Commerce itself also has a very important responsibility for agricultural products. If businesses that transport and sell our country's agricultural products do not have a complete organization as businesses that transport and sell foreign agricultural products do, then foreign agricultural products will naturally overwhelm our country's agricultural products in the market.</p>
<p>Many people have already talked about the lack of improvement in farmers' technology. I think that what has not been improved is the failure to apply industrial inventions to agricultural technology. We often hear people say that China has a large population and does not need machines. I think this is an extremely absurd statement. Farmers in advanced countries each have nearly twenty horsepower of machinery to use. One horsepower can抵到 eight strong farmers, so one farmer can抵到 one hundred and sixty of our farmers. If we compare the population of farmers in the United States and Russia, are our farmers really one hundred and sixty times more numerous than the farmers in those countries? Moreover, the food consumption of one hundred and sixty natural persons is very different from the consumption of twenty horsepower of machinery. Even if we have a large population, we cannot use it as an excuse not to use mechanical power.</p>
<p>Lack of Self-Confidence Among Farmers  The saying "What does the emperor's power have to do with me?" is no longer applicable. Farmers who have contact with the outside world naturally have a feeling of weakness. Farmers often have actions similar to asking for alms when they see outsiders. For example, when they say that their fields are barren, they do not know how to try their best to remedy the situation by farming, but instead invite the surveyors of barren land to survey the land. Their only hope is to seek exemption from taxes, and they do not do anything more besides requesting tax exemption. Another example is that when they encounter disasters, if someone comes to provide relief, the farmers only have the mentality of waiting to be fed, and they lack the work of self-reliance. As soon as a porridge kitchen opens, the poor people around the porridge kitchen only move their families to eat there, and few go to find work. This mentality of relying on others and not on oneself is true not only in times of famine, but also in ordinary times. To save the rural areas, we should have the farmers save themselves. This kind of long-standing mentality must not be allowed. Because this kind of mentality is precisely the reason for the decline of the rural areas, we should quickly use the power of education to correct this kind of mentality. Otherwise, if the farmers do not have a healthy mentality to do the work of self-reliance in the rural areas, others will not be able to save the rural areas.</p>
<p>In short, the reasons for the decline of Chinese rural areas are extremely complex. Each region has its own unique reasons, and each reason has its own interrelationship with the others. Saving the rural areas cannot be effective by only focusing on the rural areas. We must consider the various aspects related to the rural areas, directly or indirectly, in order to achieve the goal of revitalizing the rural areas. These are the opinions I have contributed.</p>

<p>Correspondence from the Western Frontier</p>
<h3>Record of a Journey to Qinghai</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xueba</p>
<p>Being fond of travel, I spent nine months in the Kawabata-Golok region in the twenty-second year [of the Republic]. In the twenty-third year, I returned to the South and rested for eleven months. In the winter of the twenty-fourth year, my interest in traveling became active again.</p>
<p>On December 1st, the Special Envoy Cheng, who was escorting the Panchen Lama back to Tibet, departed westward from Pukou with a special train. At the same time, I was also taken to Xi'an by this train. In Xi'an, due to waiting for a car, I was delayed for a whole month.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and we arrived in Lanzhou again on January 12th of the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic]. The Special Envoy's office needed to prepare everything for entering Tibet, so there was a relatively long period of delay. I took this opportunity to go to Qinghai first for a trip, and at the same time, I prepared to investigate the customs of the local Turen, Mongol, and Tibetan people in Qinghai, to make up for the regret of having reached the edge of Qinghai in the past without entering the interior.</p>
<p>I stayed in Lanzhou for ten days, and the time was already at the end of the lunar year. The Northwestern people, who had not abandoned old customs, were busy preparing for the New Year. At every city gate, there were posters from the Xin Sui Automobile Company saying, "Ten yuan will take you to Qinghai to celebrate the New Year." Mr. Ke, who was willing to accompany me, and I were attracted by these red posters, so we took leave from the Special Envoy's office. On January 21st, which was the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth lunar month, we set off westward. The car drove through dust and over high mountains for two and a half days, and we arrived in Xining City, the provincial capital of Qinghai, just in time for the lunar New Year's Eve. That night, the crackling sound of firecrackers filled the city, as if welcoming us new travelers. There was also a heavy snowfall in the evening. "Snow heralds a good year," and the people of Xining were celebrating the New Year in joy. Our traveling life thus began.</p>
<p>We were determined to participate in the lively Tumin New Year, so even though today is the first day of the lunar year, we did not want to rest. Last night we hired a sedan car to go to Huzhu County. Because today is New Year's Day, the price for the ninety-li flat road was as high as fourteen yuan, but we finally settled on five yuan.</p>
<p>The morning light illuminated the city of Xining. We sat in the sedan car and headed into the mountain valley to the northeast. Our New Year's Day breakfast was a few dry biscuits chewed with the sub-zero northwest wind. The car passed over the ice of the Huangshui River, and the bright white snow was crushed into two long lines by our wheels. Sparse villages spread out on the hills.</p>
<p>After twenty li, the mule cart turned north and went upstream along the Shatang River. White poplar trees with elegant branches and trunks were interspersed on both sides of the road, embellishing the scenery along the way. Along the way, there were mostly Han Chinese farms. Women with bound feet, wearing floral shoes, covered their heads with black cloth; with lake-green, and rose-red outer garments trimmed with five-colored wide borders. We were concerned about the Tumin people, but we never found a single one of them.</p>
<p>At the end of the mountains on both sides, we discovered a city-like building on a flat dam at an elevation of 2,670 meters; this was Huzhu County. The sedan car entered through the city gate. The city was quiet and silent, with few pedestrians. Only a few children were kicking shuttlecocks and setting off firecrackers. The doors of the shops were covered with red New Year couplets and closed tightly.</p>
<p>Our car stopped in front of the county government office. County Magistrate Ma Shiruan had already received a call from the Civil Affairs Department last night, so he welcomed us in. That night, we stayed at the county government office and were treated to a grand feast by the county magistrate. During the meal, we learned that the Tumin villages were several miles away from the county seat, so we decided to go to the nearest Tumin village, Tangba Fort, tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The thermometer dropped to minus twelve degrees Celsius. The room was heated with coal, and my head unknowingly began to ache unusually, mostly due to the effects of coal poisoning.</p>
<p>Shy Ladies</p>
<p>After breakfast the next morning, the county government sent Director Wang, two policemen, and two animals to send me to Tangba Fort, which was three miles northwest of the city.</p>
<p>In a village two li away, in front of a Tumin house, on a swing made of two wooden poles leaning against an earthen wall, we discovered a pair of women in red clothes and red hats, swinging on the ropes. The bright clothes and lively postures attracted us to jump off our horses and watch from across the wall. When the Tumin women knew that there were strangers watching, they scattered off the ropes in a flurry.</p>
<p>We led our horses and went along the main road not far, and arrived at Baiyazi Village, where there were more Tumin houses. This place was the center of Tangba Fort. A "red card" - the village head - came out to greet us into his home. The red card was a Han Chinese, and his home also had a kang and a brazier. Director Wang told him the purpose of our visit to investigate Tumin customs. He immediately summoned five or six elderly Tumin people. Because of their proximity to the city, they had been deeply Sinicized. They were all dressed in cloth and leather hats, and spoke fluent Mandarin. When I asked them about their Tumin language, many of them could not answer.</p>
<p>On the swing in front of the village, there were several Tumin women playing. When we went out to prepare for investigation and photography, they all ran away shyly. But in the end, four colorful Tumin women were chased back by several Tumin men. At this time, they were even more embarrassed. When I took pictures of them, they were too shy to even lift their heads.</p>
<p>The Mystery of the Village Temple</p>
<p>Now we will go to their village temple to visit:</p>
<p>The temple is on a raised earthen mound. Going up along the stone steps, there is mostly a brick wall. Entering the gate, there is a courtyard planted with four cypress trees. Behind it is a spacious house, which is the temple hall. The architecture imitates the style of Northwestern temples, with very short eaves. The dark walls are covered with Lamaist god banners. On the silk cloth, which is three or four feet long and one or two feet wide, are painted Tsongkhapa, Sakyamuni, and mule-riding heavenly kings. On the offering table under the god banners, there is a row of mud Buddhas eight inches high, made in a model, so most of them are seated in the lotus position, and painted with beautiful colors on the outside. The Tumin name is "Zhazha."</p>
<p>In the center of the low table, there are many large momos, each momo with a diameter of one foot and a weight of two pounds. These are their New Year's gifts to the gods. In the center of the stacked momos, there is a four-foot-high divine arrow that looks like a javelin. The light of the clear oil lamp illuminates the red and green ribbon strips on the arrow, draped like the clothes of the divine arrow. A string of copper bells and copper plates hangs from the neck of the arrow. This is their most believed-in guardian deity arrow, also called the Wutai Guardian. According to them, the peace of their village, the local agricultural products, and the health of the Tumin people all depend on the protection of this divine arrow.</p>
<p>To the left of the divine arrow is enshrined the spirit of the Garuda bird. It also receives offerings of large momos. Its idol is a wooden board, three feet high in plane, covered with shredded paper strips, symbolizing the feathers of the "divine Garuda." A long, two-inch arc-shaped wooden strip is installed on the head as the beak of the divine Garuda. Circular eyes are also painted. The Garuda bird is also a believed-in and effective deity.</p>
<p>The Singing of the Tumin People</p>
<p>We do not plan to return to the county government today. In the evening, we will send someone to fetch the bedding from the county government. We plan to find a Tumin home to stay in, so that we can understand the daily life habits of the Tumin people tomorrow, but the poor Tumin people do not have a spare room to accommodate our group of new guests. So we have no choice but to stay overnight at the red card's house.</p>
<p>The Tumin people are a singing people. In the evening, we paid two dollars for wine and invited six or seven Tumin people to sing. Singing is called "Dao La" in the Tumin language. The mountain songs they improvise in the fields are mostly lewd lyrics between men and women. But on auspicious holidays, the songs sung in the courtyard must be auspicious and historical songs.</p>
<p>Tonight, only men are singing. They squat in a circle on the ground, with a pot of warmed white wine in the middle. Everyone passes around and drinks a few sips, and then sings at the top of their lungs. The singing is smooth, melodious, and pleasant to listen to, but the tune is very simple. They sing in Mandarin, which may be due to the deep Sinicization. However, we still find it difficult to understand the lyrics. After a few songs, I asked them to go back because I had to develop photos.</p>
<p>Later, I recorded their lyrics, and Mr. Ke Hongkuang also composed a tune for them.</p>
<p>Historical song, titled "Qi Family Feast, used when singing Dao La at weddings."</p>
<p>Notation:</p>
<p>Song: (Part One) In the chaotic years of the Twenty-Eight Mansions, the bandit Miaozi are full of murderous intent. The east rebels and the west is in chaos. The emperor's prince issues great righteousness. The first village comes, the second village comes, the third village cries and comes. Officials fear not being affectionate after three invitations. There are many years of rebellion by thieves in Luoyang City. The thieves in Luoyang City compete for great merit. General Qi is a small official. Two officers, please listen. Select seventeen or eighteen from the crowd. Select horses four or five years old. (Child horses are male horses, and "pian" horses are castrated horses.) The big red saddle is wrapped in water. The silk belt is wrapped again and again. Fake silver ornaments, plum blossom stirrups. Ox horn bow, chain arrows. At three or four in the morning, twirling the spear. Running the pole horse is an official. The little brother of the Miao horse runs three hundred and sixty miles. (Part Two) Thirty to pick soldiers, the first day to send soldiers, the artillery sounds three times, the men and horses stand at the school ground, the call sounds three times, the men and horses go forward. The commander conveys the order, all generals listen carefully to my words, eat together, buy together, and use together. Do not disturb the good people. Anyone who does not obey the commander's order will be pushed out of the camp gate and beheaded. One point short will be beaten forty times, two points short will be beaten eighty times, three points short will definitely be beheaded.</p>
<p>Flirting song, Dao La sung in the mountains and fields. Song: River there! River here! A thousand layers of peony plates are large.</p>
<p>Don't provoke your brother; if you provoke your brother, the flower will be picked.</p>
<p>New Year's Entertainment</p>
<p>The next morning was the third day of the lunar New Year. In every Tumin home, they burned cypress branches on a tile to pay respect to the gods. A few children drove a small flock of a dozen sheep and placed them on the white ground by the river. The river is the Shatang River. Two or three Tumin women in red were carrying two buckets of water. We were very lucky to encounter a full bucket of water when we went out, which is an auspicious omen - according to Tumin superstition.</p>
<p>After breakfast, in the courtyard in front of the village, a group of men were sitting around drinking. This wine was what we had given them last night, so everyone started singing Dao La again when we went there. Today there were more people and the mood was very high. They sang and drank, and a few young men were already drunk. They took advantage of their drunkenness and couldn't help but drag two or three people to the fields to sing lewd songs, because the lyrics were vulgar and needed to be avoided by their elders.</p>
<p>The children were taking turns learning to swing under the swing. Generally, the women wearing new clothes would no longer be as shy and evasive as they were yesterday when they saw us, because I had already developed the photos from yesterday and sent them to them. They were very surprised and delighted when they saw their own images, and thus became familiar with us. Their entertainment was kicking shuttlecocks and throwing thread balls in the field. The shuttlecocks were made of wool or chicken feathers and copper coins. The money balls were made of wool thread. The way they kicked shuttlecocks was only to steadily kick the number, with more being the winner. Throwing the money ball was to throw the ball to the ground, then turn around and catch it before the ball fell, then throw it again and turn again, also with more being the winner. When they were exercising, the golden sunlight shone on their smiling purple cheeks and the fluttering red clothes, and their hearts were filled with New Year's joy. When we went to watch, they played even more vigorously.</p>

<h3>Severe Spring Famine in Western Anhui, Famine Victims in Four Counties Urgently Await Relief</h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The western part of Anhui Province borders Henan and Hubei, with crisscrossing mountains and obstructed transportation. The people's lives still follow ancient customs. The main local products are bamboo, wood, tea, hemp, etc. Before the Republic, the people of western Anhui were happy to hide their talents in the deep mountains, with little contact with the outside world. Since money did not flow out, the region was known as a prosperous area with abundant resources and prosperous people. Since the Red Bandits wreaked havoc for four years, the people have suffered from extremely rare devastation and destruction. The region's vitality has been almost completely destroyed. After the Red Bandits were cleared, it was hoped that the countryside would be restored and the people would be able to rest. However, last year's severe drought caused thousands of miles of red land, and the fields were burned like fire. The harvest of grains was poor, especially in the four counties of Huoqiu, Liu'an, Lihuang, and Huoshan, where the drought and famine were the most severe, and the disaster situation was extremely tragic. Recently, it has evolved into a spring famine, which has become a widespread phenomenon. Most of the survivors are struggling on the brink of starvation. The degree of famine is even more severe than in the counties of northern Anhui. According to a refugee from Liu'an, Liu'an has suffered from years of drought and repeated bandit disasters, and the countryside has been extremely dilapidated. As a result, the strong have taken risks and fled, while the old and weak beg in all directions. Farmers in rural areas who plant several shi of land must pay more than ten yuan in various taxes every month. In the Subu area of the fourth district, some farmers who owed two years of unpaid land taxes were forced to commit suicide by jumping into the river after repeated urging by the tax collectors. Such incidents are endless and heartbreaking. Moreover, farmers in the four townships, due to a lack of food, even use grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs. Recently, the tree bark has also been eaten up, and many use elm wood blocks, baked and ground into flour to survive. They are emaciated and pitiful to look at. Everyone hopes that the government will quickly release spring relief to save these starving people who are waiting to die. (March 9th)</p>

<h3>Kunshan: Principals of People's Education Centers Request Relief</h3>
<p>The county's social education agencies have been completely closed. The principals of the various people's education centers are preparing to go to the province for training.

Now that the training period is imminent, they are extremely apprehensive, and have decided to convene a joint meeting of the principals of the people's education centers of various counties at the Wuxi Education College on the 14th of this month to discuss a solution.</p>
<h3>The Filling and Construction of the Ring Road Around the Mountain Will Be Completed by the End of the Month</h3>

<h3>Wuxi: 83 Silkworm Rearing Guidance Centers Established</h3>

They will gather on the 11th and depart on April 1st. All instructors should do their best to promote joint cocoon drying and joint transportation and sales.

<h3>Organize the Provincial Cocoon Industry Association</h3>
<p>There are more than 400 cocoon businesses in Jiangsu Province. Recently, in order to study the development of the industry and increase benefits, a joint association of cocoon industry associations in the province was organized.

<h3>Falsely Accused of Hiding 120,000 Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the Legal Tender, there have been few discoveries of civilians privately hiding silver dollars. However, in the middle of last month, a resident of Yingshanhe in this county, Zhao Changqiu, who claimed to be, sent a telegram on behalf of the Provincial Security Command, accusing Xia Bozhou, a resident of Yingshanhe, of privately hiding 120,000 silver dollars. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Security Command immediately secretly ordered the county government of this county to order the Public Security Bureau to send inspector Feng Yimao to lead the police to search. As a result, nothing was found. Furthermore, after checking the household registration in the Yingshanhe area, there was no such person as Zhao Changqiu. Therefore, the handling situation was reported to Director Chen for review. Afterwards, Xia Bozhou, due to the unwarranted search, sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce requesting relief. After receiving the letter, the chamber of commerce believed that since the plaintiff Zhao Changqiu could not be found, it was obviously a false accusation with a fabricated name, causing trouble for no reason, which was related to social security. Yesterday, it specifically forwarded a letter to the county government, requesting a strict investigation of the person who made the false accusation with a fabricated name, to be sent to the province for investigation and handling, to reassure the good people and avoid causing trouble.</p>

However, some small business owners in the urban area have not completed the registration procedures due to various reasons. As for the public property in the urban area, in addition to the property management office, the Education Bureau occupies the most land, but it has not yet been registered. Now it is learned that the Land Bureau has stipulated two methods: To notify each household that has not registered in the urban area separately, setting a deadline for them to report to the bureau for registration, otherwise they will be subject to standard management. The method is under consideration. To prepare for the start of land registration in the Fourth District. The planning and preparation of other necessary procedures are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Changshu: A Female Opium Trafficker Was Arrested at the Station</h3>
<p>At noon on the 10th, a female opium trafficker was arrested at the Zhizhiang bus station in this county. She was carrying 108 taels of opium. She has been handed over to the county's judicial office for investigation, and may be sent to the province. The woman's name is Yan Pan, and she is from Meili. Her husband's name is Yan Lin, and he was originally a private opium trafficker. Last year, Yan was arrested for transporting opium and was sentenced to imprisonment by the authorities. Unexpectedly, Pan was not afraid of the law and continued her husband's business, going to the Shanghai area to traffic opium. This time, she got off at Zhizhiang station, which was seen by the local security team. Pan knew that the miscellaneous taxes were exempted, so she gave four taels of opium to the team members. At that time, due to the large number of people, they immediately refused and took her to the team records, and then transferred her to the county government. Pan has now confessed to transporting opium, and the county plans to send her to the province for review and handling.</p>

We should express our admiration. In the future, we should continue to work hard and promote its glory. In a negative sense, we should do our utmost to eradicate opium, bandits, and bad people. In a positive sense, we should train the people, revive industry and commerce, improve cotton production and native cloth, and promote rural sideline occupations such as pig farming. Everything must be rationalized to make the revival of Nantong a common goal. We should not indulge in empty talk. The industrial and educational conference for the entire district has been postponed due to insufficient preparation.</p>

<h3>Jiashan: Road-Building Laborers Clash with Steamer</h3>
<p>Two hundred and sixty-five laborers from Fan Jingzhen set off on the 9th to build the Hangfeng Highway. In the evening, they rowed small boats and asked the Jianan steamer of the Wang Qingji Shipping Bureau to tow them, but the steamer refused. The laborers had no dinner and flocked to the county government to petition, causing great disorder and hindering traffic. Later, the county magistrate persuaded them to return home and issued each person a dime for food. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 10th, the laborers still demanded that the steamer tow them to Shan, causing a clash. The driver struck two laborers with pliers, one on the head and one on the hand. The laborers were furious and led more than a hundred people into the city, carrying flags and hoes, demanding to see the county magistrate and punish the perpetrator before they would start work. The police brigade and public security officers maintained order. After the county magistrate announced a solution to the laborers, they dispersed.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Agricultural Bank Continues Lending to Fishermen</h3>

The county government sent personnel to guide the organization of cooperatives to borrow from the bank. Now that the term has expired, the fishermen have repaid the principal and interest of the loan with excellent credit.

A contract has been signed.</p>

<h3>Cixi: Baoli Hospital Plans to Build an Obstetrics Room</h3>
<p>Baoli Hospital has been established for nearly 30 years. Since 1925, it has received funding from the Birth Insurance Group to promote modern midwifery, which has been implemented rapidly. In recent years, pregnant women in urban and rural areas have often come to the hospital for delivery, but the hospital building is insufficient, and they have to share a room with ordinary patients. The situation is different, and there are many obstacles. Moreover, the wards are sometimes full, leaving no room for expectant mothers. The hospital plans to build three obstetrics rooms on the vacant land behind the hospital. The internal and external facilities require 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. It is reported that a wealthy merchant has taken the lead in donating several thousand yuan to promote the project.</p>

<h3>Class A Unified Public Bonds: Exchange Started Yesterday, Those Going to Exchange Were Very Crowded, Exchange of Class B Public Bonds Scheduled to Begin</h3>
<p>The exchange of 150 million yuan in Class A unified public bonds for six types of old bonds, including 18-year customs treasury bills, began yesterday at the bond exchange office at 452 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, and at the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications in various locations. Those going to exchange were quite crowded. The exchange of Class B bonds will begin on the 21st. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exchange of Class A Unified Bonds Began Yesterday</p>
<p>The exchange of unified public bonds began yesterday. The exchange hours are from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM. Although it was raining yesterday, those holding bonds to exchange were still very crowded. The staff at the office were very busy. At 2:30 PM, because those requesting to exchange were still arriving, the main gate was closed and those arriving late were advised to come another day. However, today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death and the office is closed as per usual. Therefore, exchanges will resume tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>First Interest and Principal Payment in July</p>
<p>The total amount of Class A accumulated public bonds is 150.1 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, divided into 24 installments. Principal and interest are repaid every January and July. The first repayment of principal of 750,000 yuan and interest of 4.5 million yuan is scheduled to be paid on July 21st of this year.

<h3>Money Shops Improve Business: Fuyuanyuan, Zifeng and Other Shops Effective After Reform, Qingda and Other Shops Plan to Imitate Reform</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice Agency, the Shanghai Money Shops Association holds manager meetings every year in spring, summer, autumn and winter to improve business, and organizes a Money Shops Business Research Association. Now Fuyuan, Zifeng and other shops have been reformed, imitating the banking system, and Qingda and other shops plan to imitate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Decline of Money Shops: Money shops have a long history and mainly rely on credit lending. Since the development of banking business, their business has been greatly affected. In Shanghai, ten years ago, money shops accounted for 85% of the negotiable instruments circulating in the market, banks accounted for 10%, and others accounted for 5%. Five years ago, money shops accounted for 50% of the negotiable instruments circulating in the market, banks accounted for 40%, and others accounted for 10%. Currently, banks account for 70% of the negotiable instruments circulating in the market, money shops account for 20%, and others account for 10%. For example, the money shop with the most business surplus last year was only Fuyuanyuan with more than 50,000 yuan, and those with mediocre surpluses accounted for more than half of the industry. This year, only 48 money shops are listed on the market.</p>
<p>Improvement of Business: The Money Shops Association, in order to improve business, in addition to establishing a Business Research Association and holding manager meetings of various shops in spring, summer, autumn and winter to jointly discuss and study, also established a Money Shops Joint Reserve to centralize reserves. Now it is also planning to establish a Money Shops Bill Acceptance Office. The business of each money shop has always focused on credit lending, but now it focuses on mortgage lending, because credit lending is extremely dangerous in this time of economic downturn. Mortgage lending can reduce the risk because there are goods as collateral.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of Reform: The money shops that have been reformed are Fuyuan, Zifeng, etc., and have achieved good results. The following is a record of Fuyuanyuan's business: The Business Department specializes in all money shop businesses; the Deposit Department is divided into five categories: fixed-term, notice, current, special, etc.; the Loan Department is divided into four categories: fixed-term, mortgage, current overdraft, factory, etc.; the Trust Department is divided into two categories: custody, agency, etc.; a warehouse is attached to undertake the stacking of customer goods, and also does mortgage loans, and builds a custody steel vault to handle the open custody of government bonds, stocks, and the rental of safety deposit boxes, which is the same as the banking business. Now Qingda and other shops have planned to imitate it.</p>
<h3>Six-Percent British Gold Loan: Scheduled Lottery for Principal Repayment, April 3rd Morning at the Central Bank, Total Principal to be Repaid is £57,000</h3>
<p>The Committee for the Management of Funds for the 6% British Gold Boxer Indemnity Loan of 1934 issued the eighth notice yesterday: "For the purpose of this notice, it is hereby decided that the fourth round of lottery for principal repayment of this public bond will be held publicly at the Central Bank of Shanghai at 10:00 AM on April 3rd of this year, with a total amount of £57,000. All winning bonds will be paid at face value starting from July 1, 1936. This notice is hereby issued. Chairman Xu Kan."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Audit Office Will Handle Audits of State-Run Institutions: Scheduled to Begin Next Fiscal Year, Lin Jinyu Traveled to Nanjing Yesterday to Seek Instructions</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Audit Office originally dispatched personnel to handle the accounting affairs of the Shanghai Municipal Government and its affiliated institutions, based on auditing regulations. Since its implementation, progress has been smooth. However, in addition to local institutions, there are many central government-affiliated and state-run institutions in the city. Initially, because it was just starting, the auditing department directly handled the auditing matters. Now, the central government believes that state-run institutions are related to national revenue. From next fiscal year, the audits will be transferred to the audit office so they can be handled more efficiently and conveniently. Lin Jinyu, the director of the office, took the night train to Nanjing yesterday to seek instructions from his superiors on the direction of progress. According to Lin's discussion before leaving, the office will begin handling the auditing affairs of state-run institutions in the city, such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the two railway administration bureaus, starting next fiscal year. Currently, the deadline is approaching, and all procedures will be actively prepared. Therefore, I am traveling to Nanjing to seek instructions from the ministry. After I return to Shanghai, I will contact the two institutions first, so that I can dispatch personnel to handle the auditing matters of the two institutions at the beginning of the fiscal year.</p>
<h3>This Lumber Industry Association: Yesterday Asked the Party Department to Protect the Introduction of Laws, The Introduction of Laws Protects Human Rights and Questions Finance Officers, If They Do Not Follow Resolutions, Merchants Will Be in Danger</h3>
<p>The timber merchants’ association of this city presented a petition to the City Party Department yesterday requesting protection for local merchants, stating that they should not be arbitrarily arrested without legal procedures. The original petition was regarding the financial bureau's responsible personnel making inappropriate statements, insulting the law, and trampling on human rights, requesting legal correction. "It is noted that Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution of the Political Tutelage Period of the National Government states that people shall not be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished except in accordance with the law. If a person is suspected of a crime and is arrested or detained, the arresting or detaining authority shall transfer the person to a judicial organ for interrogation within 24 hours at the latest. Article 302 of the Criminal Law stipulates that anyone who illegally detains or deprives a person of their freedom of movement by other illegal means shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years, detention, or a fine of not more than 300 yuan. Article 125 stipulates that any public official who has the duty to prosecute or punish crimes and commits one of the following acts shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not less than one year and not more than seven years: Abuse of power to arrest or detain. The National Government's Decree No. 177 of March 24 stipulates that the exercise of governing powers shall protect the people's lives, property, and freedom of business in a practical manner and shall not infringe upon them arbitrarily. The Judicial Department's Order No. 639 stipulates that criminal suspects shall not be detained arbitrarily. The country's protection of human rights is enshrined in law and emphasized by orders. How meticulous it is. Now, our industry has corrected the house tax at the Beishi Tax Collection Office, resulting in the unfortunate fact that Chen Qizhang, the manager of Futai Lumber Company, was arbitrarily detained. We have presented a petition to the ministry for relief and have been ordered to persuade the company to resume business first and wait for a solution. The association should wait quietly for the legal proceedings. How dare we make another petition? Unexpectedly, on March 9, the Xinshen and other newspapers had a statement from a responsible person in the Finance Bureau, which stated that the facts described therein had been petitioned to the municipal authorities and sued in court. The statement is true, and the association need not defend it. However, the statement that ‘sending the police to force collection is a common means of dealing with resistance to taxes’ horrified and angered the association. It is noted that Futai Lumber Company has more than 50,000 yuan worth of lumber, and manager Chen Qizhang also has considerable wealth. It is impossible for him to move all the lumber away in a short period of time for a mere 400 yuan in taxes, and there is no risk of him absconding. At that time, Chen Qizhang, the manager of Futai, was at the Zhabei Tax Collection Office and voluntarily signed a ten-day check due to the unbearable pressure. The tax collection office still refused to accept it, intending to arbitrarily detain him. The purpose was not to detain him for three or five years. Finally, Futai's manager was detained for as long as 28 hours, had his fingerprints taken, and was photographed, as if he were a major thief. If the association had not sent personnel to negotiate, and the six major lumber companies, Yuanshun, Ruida, Xiesheng, Hengxiang, Fuji, and Dazai, had not jointly provided a guarantee (guaranteed payment within three days), his detention would have been endless. This unfortunate fact is considered a great shame and humiliation by merchants, arousing public outrage, and leading to a strike and petition to fight for dignity. However, the responsible personnel of the bureau not only did not correct the illegal acts of their subordinates, but regarded this as a common procedure for handling resistance to taxes, which is nothing strange, as if it were a daily routine. Just like eating three meals a day and devouring them greedily, they do not seem to be satisfied with their appetite. They do not have any sympathy for others in the same industry, and everyone is afraid of being arrested. All merchants will be arbitrarily arrested and detained, becoming the second and third Chen Qizhang, perhaps thousands and hundreds of them. The association feels endangered and dares not remain silent. Therefore, it is specially requested that the Party Department severely investigate and punish the responsible personnel of the Finance Bureau who made such arrogant statements. At the same time, it is requested that the Judicial Department of the Executive Yuan issue a circular to the whole country, stating that in the future, legitimate merchants shall not be arrested or detained except in accordance with the law, in order to maintain the rule of law and reassure merchants. The association is extremely eager to wait for orders."</p>

<h3>Telephone Conference to Further Discuss Taxpayer Meeting: Providing Six Opinions</h3>
<p>The Telephone Problem Committee of this city's Special District, in order to oppose telephone price increases, yesterday sent letters to various Chinese Taxpayer Associations and the "Four-Person Association," proposing discussions in their meetings to seek effective responses. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, upon investigation, the Shanghai Telephone Company, relying on its operating license agreement with the Public Works Department, is determined to achieve an annual dividend of one fen.

Our committee has repeatedly resolved to request its cancellation, and the dispute has continued until now without a fair resolution. We understand that your esteemed association will soon convene a taxpayer meeting. Our association, representing telephone users of Chinese nationality in the concession, will present these matters to the attendees of the meeting in order to seek a reasonable solution. We believe that telephone service is a public utility, and its profits should vary with the economic strength of society. In this time of social and economic collapse, no business can maintain a one fen annual dividend. The company, wielding the contract as a talisman, is acting as if its only purpose is exploitation, which is unacceptable in terms of human sentiment and reason. Furthermore, the proposed method of charging according to calls, if implemented, will restrict all industries, cause social unrest, and significantly affect all citizens. Considering the situation, we cannot help but tremble with fear. Now that your esteemed association is about to hold a taxpayer meeting, we should seek a thorough solution to this issue. Therefore, we submit the following points for your consideration, requesting that they be submitted to the meeting for discussion: 1. The Public Works Department's signing of a public utility contract without the consent of the taxpayers is improper and should be discussed at the meeting. 2. The current implementation of the call-based charging method for telephones is exploiting the Chinese people's economy and hindering commercial development, and the Public Works Department should be instructed to correct it. 3. Request the meeting to resolve to encourage citizens to invest in order to be prepared to evaluate and recover all property rights of the company. 4. The company's unilateral implementation of the charging method gives users the right to refuse. 5. If disconnections cause incidents, the company should bear full responsibility. 6. Request the meeting to discuss the regulation that the official interest rate for public utilities should not exceed five li, and that any increase should first be sought from representatives of the taxpayer association to solicit citizens' opinions, and then transferred to the Public Works Department Board of Directors for adoption. If these procedures are not followed, citizens have the right to refuse payment. Accordingly, we hereby submit this information, hoping that it will be presented to the meeting for discussion."</p>

<h3>Qian Chengxu Invites Factory Owners to Discuss the Development of Small Factories</h3>
<p>Mr. Qian Chengxu of the China General Industrial Federation sent a letter yesterday to the factory owners and managers of various factories in this city, stating: "Respectfully, in recent years, the strength of domestic goods has gradually become widespread. However, the focus is mostly on large factories, while general small factories not only lack any protection but also suffer greatly in terms of operations and financing. I feel that a country's wealth naturally depends on production for its life. However, the concept of so-called production does not only lie in the development of a few large industries. There must be a large number of industries engaged in production in order to maintain the fate of national wealth. Regarding this point, I will convene a meeting with the factory owners who have had historical connections with me to study how to maintain the lives of small factories in the future and how to seek simple ways to develop them. Therefore, I have scheduled a joint meeting of factory owners and managers to be held at 2:00 PM on March 16th at the address of our association, No. 115 Second Ma Road. I hope that you will honor us with your presence and guidance."</p>
<h3>The China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company Mortgages Two Places, incurring Huge Debts to Foreign Banks - Three Chinese Banks Undertake Them - Contract Already Signed by Cai Zengji</h3>
<p>The reason why the reorganization of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company over the years has not achieved good results is that its foreign debts cannot be cleared up. The largest of the company's huge foreign debts are loans from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and Citibank, totaling 20 million yuan. The annual interest alone, secured by the various wharves and warehouses mortgaged, amounts to over 1 million yuan. During Liu Hongsheng's tenure, he repeatedly negotiated with the government and consulted with the authorities of these two banks to revise the contract, reducing the interest rate from one fen to four li. These debts are now to be borne and repaid by the Chinese banking sector. Foreign merchants have also expressed sympathy for this. After Cai Zengji took over as General Manager, he followed the established policies and continued the previous discussions, officially resolving the issue of these foreign debts. The huge debts of the company mortgaged to HSBC and Citibank have been taken over by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. The transfer contract has been officially signed by Cai Zengji. All of the company's foreign debts to HSBC and Citibank will henceforth be transferred to Chinese banks. The sovereignty has been recovered, and the annual interest rate has been reduced by four li, truly a valuable and recordable event.</p>

<h3>Tai Shuangqiu and Others Initiate the Opening Ceremony of the First Year of Native Products - To be Held This Afternoon at the Civic Education Hall - Mayor Wu and Director Pan to Broadcast Speeches</h3>
<p>According to Shanghai News Agency, the Native Products Year, initiated by Tai Shuangqiu, Tang Maohuai, Zhang Yi, Zhang Jingye, Lu Shu'ang, Qi Guangzhong, and others, is scheduled to hold the opening ceremony of the first year of native products at the Shanghai Municipal People's Education Hall on Wenmiao Road at 2:00 PM this afternoon. A preparatory meeting was held at Taixia University at 10:00 AM yesterday, and the declaration and other items were passed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organizers of the Meeting: Presidium: Tai Shuangqiu, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Wenyu, Zhang _, Zhang Jingye, Chen Songchun; Invitations: Huang _, Wan _, Tang Maohuai, Lu Jiren, Tang Shuming, Ru Bocai; Records: Chen Shimin, Liu Ziming; Master of Ceremonies: Xu Pengcheng; Ushers: to be assigned by the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Mayor Cuts the Ribbon: In order to mobilize the general public to jointly promote this effort, the Executive Committee has specially invited Mayor Wu and Director Pan to broadcast speeches. Niu Tisheng, Pan Yangyao, Yu Zuoting, Wang Liming, Niu Changyao, Lu Shu'ang, and others will attend the meeting to give speeches. Mayor Wu will also be invited to cut the ribbon and open the ceremony. Representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools in this city and the surrounding counties of Shanghai will participate. Representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Industry, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will also attend to deliver speeches.</p>
<p>Declaration Published: Since the September 18th Incident, and up to the recent disturbances in various parts of North China, our powerful neighbor is pressing closer step by step, and our national territory is being lost day by day. The fate of the nation has reached its most critical juncture. We, who love our country, must be especially prepared. An indignant and patriotic movement can certainly inspire the weak and establish the stubborn, awaken national consciousness, and stimulate the dying national spirit. However, after a long time, except for a few ambitious people, it will inevitably be like rain passing and clouds disappearing, leaving nothing behind. For the country, this may not be of much benefit. Only by earnestly focusing on fundamental work and each person contributing a little more effort will the country gain a little more strength. There are different opinions among contemporary scholars on how to prepare national strength for saving the country. In our opinion, promoting native products is also one of the fundamental tasks. We humbly offer our opinion to seek correction from wise men within and outside the country.</p>
<p>Resist Aggression: Promoting domestic products can resist economic aggression. The general method of resisting the economic aggression of the great powers is considered to be the promotion of domestic loans. This certainly has sufficient reasons. However, there are also many difficulties in promoting domestic products using only the two words "domestic products." First, the so-called domestic products usually refer to machine-made foreign-style goods. Because they imitate foreign goods so skillfully, it is often impossible to distinguish them even with special care. Second, promoting domestic products turns machine-made foreign-style goods into the standard necessities of Chinese people's lives. Many goods are produced in quantities that cannot meet demand, and necessities cannot be replaced, so one has to seek them from abroad, unknowingly creating a market for foreign goods. With these two difficulties, it is difficult to thoroughly resist economic aggression by simply promoting domestic products. Only by promoting native products at the same time can these two drawbacks be avoided.</p>
<p>Develop Production: Promoting native products can develop production. The main method of developing national production is often to promote machine industry. However, in today's poor China, we do not have a large amount of capital and large-scale machines to compete with others. Therefore, promoting native products and maintaining the existing manual production is also very important. Although its efficiency is not as great as that of machines, the number of people is large, and the tools are our own, so they can be produced anytime and anywhere, accumulating like sand into a tower and producing a large number of goods. However, we should not be bound by obsolete manual production methods and remain unchanged. At the same time, we also advocate improving manual production. Moreover, this method is only a means adopted for the transitional era and can never stagnate in this mode of production forever. We will use the money saved by promoting native products to develop small machine industries in rural areas in a cooperative way, and gradually develop them into large-scale machine industries.</p>
<p>Relieve Rural Areas: Promoting native products can relieve rural areas. The importance of relieving rural areas has been generally recognized by the Chinese people. When it comes to relief methods, such as government tax exemptions and bank investments, they are all essential. However, the most urgent thing is to enable the native products produced in rural areas to have smooth outlets. If goods are unsalable, government tax exemptions are merely nominal, and bank investments are also difficult to stabilize. Moreover, the strength of China's banking sector is limited. Even if all the money from the country's banks is poured into the countryside, each farmer would only get two yuan. As for the five or six million loans, scattered, what difference is there between a cartload of firewood and a cup of water? If native products are promoted, allowing farmers to promote their own hand-spun and hand-woven native cloth, so that the 300 million farmers across the country have work to do during the five months of agricultural leisure time, even if they earn only two cents of silver a day, the amount earned each year would also be 900 million yuan, which is far from the millions of loans made by the banking sector today. Therefore, we firmly advocate promoting native products, promoting the use of native products by people in the countryside, and promoting the purchase of native products by people in the city. We hope that native products will enter the city, not that domestic goods will go to the countryside. We hope that entrepreneurs will go to the countryside to develop cooperative rural production, and not absorb the money from the countryside into the city to open factories, causing rural finance to dry up.</p>
<p>Firmly Advocate: Based on the above three reasons, we firmly advocate promoting native products and advocating the uniform use of native products within the possible scope. In order to concentrate the efforts of all parties and seek thorough implementation, we have specially gathered comrades and organized the Native Products Promotion Implementation Committee, formulated a ten-year action plan, and aroused the public to promote it together. On the occasion of the opening of the first year of native products, we sincerely present our superficial views and respectfully hope that people from all walks of life will give us more guidance.</p>
<h3>The Pan-Pacific Association Hosted the Head of the German Economic Study Group Yesterday, Mr. Knopp, Who Spoke on the German Economic Situation</h3>
<p>Mr. Knopp, the head of the German Far East Economic Study Group, will remain for more than a week after returning from Guangdong before visiting Nanjing again to bid farewell to our authorities and then return to Shanghai to await his ship to leave China and continue his investigations in Siam. The Pan-Pacific Association of this port held a tea party at the Duchene Hotel on Jiangxi Road yesterday afternoon to host Mr. Knopp. Dr. Wang Zhengting presided over the meeting, and Mr. Chen Bingzhang, representing Finance Minister Kong, Mr. Reinhardt, the German Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Weidfelt, the Commercial Counselor, as well as members of the association of various nationalities and German expatriates, totaling over 120 people, attended. Dr. Knopp gave a speech on the German economic situation, the gist of which was that since Chancellor Hitler came to power, the German economic situation has gradually improved. The burden of war debts has been the most difficult for Germany. Germany is now importing raw materials from foreign countries so that various industries can continue to work. China-Germany trade is beneficial. According to statistics, the exports and imports of the two countries have increased in recent years, and it is hoped that this trend will continue.</p>
<h3>The Entire Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Line to be Completed Next Spring - The Qiantang River Bridge is Being Built Day and Night - Tenders Invited for the Rail Connection from Nanxing Bridge to the Bridge</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, in order to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, the Ministry of Railways is working day and night on the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge. Tenders will soon be invited for the construction of the Cao'e Ting Bridge and the railway section from the Cao'e River to the Qiantang River Bridge. The tender for the rail connection from Nanxing Bridge to the Qiantang River Bridge will be opened on a scheduled date. It is expected that the completion of the entire line will occur simultaneously next spring. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Qiantang River Bridge Being Built Day and Night: The Qiantang River Bridge project has made considerable progress after working day and night. Of the five approach bridge foundations on the south bank, two have been completed. Of the ten on the north bank, seven have been completed. Steel frames have been transported and are being assembled. The bridge pier foundations have been completed. Of the fifteen main bridge piers, except for one near the north bank that is cast in place and now completed, the rest are using floating caissons. The floating caissons are made entirely of reinforced concrete, using steel for the caisson's frame. The project is huge. The work of placing and sinking the floating caissons is now underway. It is expected that the bridge will be completed and open to traffic next year.</p>
<p>Nanxing Bridge Invites Tenders for Rail Connection: Due to the rapid progress of the bridge project, the rail connection line from Nanxing Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line to the Qiantang River Bridge must also be prepared as soon as possible. For its roadbed construction, the engineering departments of the two railway bureaus are now preparing drawings and specifications to invite contractors. It is stipulated that contractors registered with the bureau can bid. Those who wish to contract for this project should pay a fee of two yuan for the printing of drawings at the General Affairs Section of the Engineering Department, Rooms 103 and 104 on the second floor of the railway bureau, from March 6th, to obtain the bidding regulations, specifications, drawings, and the bidding form for this project. The deadline for submitting the bid, along with a security deposit of 300 national currency, to the General Affairs Section of the bureau is 11:00 AM on March 23rd. The bids will be opened publicly at the bureau at 3:00 PM that afternoon.</p>
<p>Proceeding to Complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line: In order to complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line, the Ministry of Railways will borrow 16 million yuan from the China Construction Corporation and the China-British Bank to build the railway and bridges in the section from Cao'e to the Qiantang River Bridge. Now that the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge is underway, the two railway bureaus are actively proceeding with the Cao'e Bridge and the railway section from the Cao'e River to the Qiantang River Bridge. The surveying and land acquisition for this has already been completed, and tenders for the earthwork project will soon be invited for construction. It is expected that it will be completed and open to traffic at the same time as the Qiantang River Bridge.</p>
<h3>Advance Notice of Mr. Wang Guangqi's Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Guangqi of ancient Sichuan studied in Germany for 16 years and obtained a doctorate from the University of Bonn. His lectures and writings are extremely rich. In his early years, he served as a special correspondent for major newspapers, and his reports were well received. Unfortunately, he passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage in Bonn, Germany, on January 12th of this year. When the news came, everyone mourned his loss. Mr. Wang had many friends during his lifetime. Now, his friends have initiated the organization of the Wang Guangqi Memorial Committee to organize his posthumous works and plan to raise funds for other memorial events to make him last forever. Because Mr. Wang had devoted himself to the study of music for the past ten years and made great contributions, it has been decided to hold a memorial service at 10:30 AM on March 15th (Sunday) in the auditorium of the National Conservatory of Music on Shijing Road, north of the Municipal Government in the city center, to express our condolences. However, in order to avoid extravagance, the committee has stated that it will not accept wreaths, couplets, or other gifts, but hopes to receive cash donations so that the planning of permanent memorials can be realized as soon as possible. It is reported that this port's Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shishi Xinbao have been entrusted to collect these donations. It is also reported that a memorial service will be held in Nanjing at the same time at 10:00 AM in the music department of Central University (Mei'an).</p>
<h3>Xuchang Commissioner's Office to Punish the Assassin of Wu Tingsheng by Military Law</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Mr. Wu Tingsheng, the former chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Industry Association, was assassinated in Xuchang at the end of last December. The Yanbo Native Place Association and the Cigarette Association of this port, as well as Mr. Wu's family, have requested the Xuchang County Government to arrest the murderer. After two months of investigation, three murderers have been arrested, but the instigator has not yet been arrested. It is said that there are considerable clues to be found. According to relevant sources, because this case is of great importance, judicial resolution will be abandoned, and it will be handed over to the Xuchang Supervisory Commissioner's Office for military trial.</p>
<h3>Italian Army Recruits Chinese Coolies, Drives Them to the East African Battlefield</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, since the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, the Italian army has poured all its efforts into attacking Abyssinia. At the same time, it has secretly recruited Chinese coolies in various parts of Southeast Asia and South China and continuously transported them to the East African front to engage in road construction and transportation of guns and ammunition. News has now come from Shantou that recently, Chinese traitors and the Italian military authorities have secretly communicated, establishing coolie recruitment offices in Shantou, Hong Kong, and other places, ostensibly saying they are going to the Southeast Asian islands to open mines, and have recruited a large number of young people from various villages in Chaozhou and Meizhou counties. Each person is paid 100 Hong Kong dollars as a reward and sent directly to the battlefield from Hong Kong. At a time when rural areas are declining, the number of applicants is extremely enthusiastic. In three or four months, the number has reached several thousand. When the matter became known to various fellow villagers in Xingning, Chaozhou, and Meizhou, they petitioned the county governments to request measures to stop this.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Japanese-owned Yufeng Cotton Mill Factories 1 and 3 Went on Strike Yesterday Morning - The Reason Was to Oppose the Factory's Dismissal of Workers</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Japanese-owned Yufeng Cotton Mill at No. 2866 Yangshupu Road in this city employs a total of 4,200 Chinese male and female workers. The factory is internally divided into five factories. Recently, because the company dismissed workers for no reason, it caused dissatisfaction among other workers. When work started yesterday morning, 2,400 workers from Factories 1 and 3 stopped coming to the factory and went on strike. The remaining 2,000 workers from Factories 2, 4, and 5 continued to work. The striking workers also expressed to the factory that they demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Textile Factories Gradually Developing Towards North China - Saying That Shanghai Has Reached the End of its Road</h3>
<p>Translated by the Outer Review Agency from the Shanghai Daily News, since Japanese textile factories in China should follow the general trend and shift from cotton yarn production to focusing all their efforts on cotton cloth production, the increase in looms by Dakang Yufeng has been known to everyone. The Pudong factory of the Japanese-Chinese Factory in this port has also decided to add looms. The development of Japanese yarn and textile factories in this port has reached its peak. The textile center has shifted to North China (Qingdao and Tianjin). According to various statistics from Japanese textile factories in China last year, Shanghai has reached the end of its road. Qingdao has developed greatly. The Yufeng factory has a plan to establish a branch factory, and this trend is becoming increasingly obvious, with the possibility of strengthening the above two major trends. The Qingdao factory of the Shanghai Textile Company will double its existing textile machines and plans to greatly increase the number of spindles at the same time. This matter has been finalized. It has recently been decided to start construction as soon as the weather recovers. The Qingdao factory currently has 40,448 fine textile machines and 720 looms. This decision plans to add 16,000 fine yarn textile machines and 720 looms, doubling the existing capacity. This factory will also increase accordingly. Its construction project has also been decided to start as soon as the weather recovers. Furthermore, due to the changes in the political and economic situation in Tianjin, North China has now become the center of investment for various Japanese industries. The Yufeng factory in this port has decided to establish a branch factory in Tianjin. In view of this trend, the Dagong factory in this port is attempting to enter Tianjin and is currently negotiating the purchase of a certain textile factory from a Chinese merchant in Tianjin for operation.</p>

<h3>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association Decides to Allocate 100,000 Yuan for Spring Relief</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, deeply concerned about the severe spring famine in various disaster areas, convened a board meeting. Chinese and foreign directors present included Song Hanzhang, Qin Runqing, Jing Runshi, Fei Wusheng, Jin Hanlu, Lu Bohong, and Wang Yiting (represented). Director Lu Bohong reported that in northern Jiangsu, such as the Xu and Hai prefectures, floodwaters remained stagnant, reaching depths of one to two feet. However, the disaster area in western Shandong was more extensive and the situation more dire. In areas like Yuncheng, floodwaters remained four to five feet deep. Relief centers established had been maintained for seven months, and after funding limitations forced some to return, 300,000 people remained in dire need. In areas where the water had receded, over 500,000 people awaited food, having lost their homes, clothing, and farming tools, lacking even basic sustenance and on the verge of death. Seven temporary hospitals were overcrowded with the sick. Continued support for another two to three months was essential, or previous efforts would be in vain. The directors were deeply moved upon hearing this. They decided that for the Yangtze River disaster area, they would collaborate with the Jiangling, Yichang, Shashi, and Red Swastika Society for emergency relief. For the Yellow River region, they would focus on emergency measures, allocating 60,000 yuan to the Jinan branch in Shandong province. 30,000 yuan would be used for emergency relief, and 30,000 yuan would assist with housing and providing seeds and farming tools to restore spring plowing and sustain livelihoods. 20,000 yuan would be allocated to the Xu prefecture branches to handle matters following the aforementioned approach. Furthermore, 20,000 yuan was allocated to eight counties in northern Anhui, which had suffered from drought last year and were now facing a severe spring famine. A branch will be established in Yingshang to expedite emergency relief. Although the total amount was 100,000 yuan, the affected area was vast and the number of displaced people immense, making it a mere drop in the bucket. Only the most urgent cases could be addressed, and widespread assistance would require substantial support from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Duan Qirui's Sister Passes Away in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Madame Chen Tiehua, elder sister of Duan Qirui, recently arrived in Shanghai from Beijing to celebrate Duan's birthday. She unfortunately passed away at Duan's private residence at 1487 Avenue Joffre the other day at the age of sixty-six. Her remains were sent to the Meige Road Chinese Funeral Home for coffin preparation. Yesterday at 2 PM, the funeral procession departed from the funeral home, heading back to her ancestral home in Anhui. Many of Duan's former associates, such as Li Sihao, Wu Guangxin, and Zhang Shizhao, attended the funeral, making it a grand affair. Duan himself also attended the memorial service, appearing in good health but deeply saddened, showing a glimpse of his strong affections and loyalty.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Instructs Dyeing and Weaving Industry to Sell Nanyang Factory Cloth Using Yard Measurements of 36 Inches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association yesterday regarding the measurement of Nanyang factory cloth: “We received a letter on the tenth of this month from the United Association of Chinese Merchants in Sumatra, stating that the association’s joint executive and supervisory committee meeting last winter discussed a proposal from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Huoshui Mountain area requesting that Chinese cloth factories promoting cloth in the Nanyang Islands use English yards of 36 inches as a standard. The resolution was passed and forwarded to various chambers of commerce in China. We noted that Chinese cloth factories have long used 2.4 Chinese feet as one yard. This has historically caused discrepancies in cloth measurements due to the lack of standardized weights and measures during the late Qing dynasty, leading to various difficulties for cloth merchants, particularly Chinese merchants in the Nanyang Islands. Therefore, we request your association to inform domestic cloth factories that for cloth sold to Nanyang, they should adopt a standard yard of 36 inches or 91 centimeters. This will facilitate sales for overseas Chinese merchants and benefit the factories themselves. Please respond with your decision.” Upon receiving this letter, the Chamber of Commerce considered that unifying measurements would facilitate exports. It suggested that the Association convene its members to discuss and adopt the measurement standards mentioned in the letter from the Nanyang Association and inform the Chamber of Commerce of the agreed-upon measures to promptly reassure overseas Chinese merchants and prevent any potential loss of trade. This is of utmost importance.</p>

(3) The Zhangjia Zhou Beigang light pile on the Anqing to Jiujiang section of the Yangtze River has been moved. Its new position is 4.5 degrees from the Sanjiao observation point, a distance of 5.48 nautical miles, at 116 degrees 8 minutes East longitude and 29 degrees 50 minutes North latitude. The light pile has two fixed lights, red on top and white on the bottom, in a vertical arrangement.</p>
<h3>Jin Xing Real Estate Company Owner Sun Chunsheng Accused of Fraudulent Bankruptcy: Transfer of Guotai Bank Shares to Wife's Account Allegedly Harms Creditors' Interests; Criminal Lawsuit Filed</h3>
<p>Following Sun Chunsheng, owner of the Jin Xing Real Estate Company on Henan Road, declaring bankruptcy, the Special First Court appointed lawyer Liu Shifang and accountant Xie Lin as bankruptcy administrators. Discovering that Sun had allegedly committed fraudulent bankruptcy, the administrators filed a criminal lawsuit according to the law, which is still ongoing. Liu and Xie also found that Sun had transferred all of his Zhongyi Trust Company Guotai Bank shares to his wife Shao Yizhen's account last year, apparently harming the rights of creditors. Therefore, in accordance with Article 244 of the Civil Code, the administrators filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court against Sun and his wife, seeking to revoke the transfer of the shares. The total face value of the shares was 21,000 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Cao Jun of the Civil Twelfth Court summoned both defendants, but neither appeared in court. Lawyer Liu requested permission to proceed with a one-sided hearing and render a judgment, which the court granted. After Liu presented his arguments, the judge declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for the verdict to be announced.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Robbery at Accountant Firm: Zhang Zuming Sues Zhou Jinggeng for False Accusation, Demanding 35,000 Yuan in Damages; Trial Scheduled for This Month on the 13th</h3>
<p>Zhou Jinggeng, a comprador at the Xue Mairuo Accounting Firm at 9 Avenue Edward VII, was robbed of 12,000 yuan in cash in his office on June 9, 1934, at 4 PM. The case involved Zhang Zuming, a Ningbo native and shareholder of the Ruixingxiang Hardware Store on Broadway. After the French police arrested Zhang, he implicated Zhuang Jimeng, the owner of the Zhuang Yuan gambling house, Wang Lianyou, a salesman at the hardware store, and Tang Qingyue, the director of the Da De Hospital, who were subsequently arrested and handed over to the Special Second Court for prosecution. The plaintiff, Zhou Jinggeng, also filed a civil lawsuit to recover the stolen money. At the end of the trial, the court found no criminal evidence against Zhang, Zhuang, Wang, and Tang and declared them not guilty, dismissing the civil lawsuit. The police and Zhou Jinggeng were dissatisfied with the verdict and repeatedly appealed to the High Third Court and the Supreme Court, but the appeals were rejected and the original judgment was upheld. After the case was finalized, Tang Qingyue, on the grounds that Zhang Zuming had falsely implicated him, hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Zhang Zuming in the Criminal Division of the Special First Court for false accusation. After a preliminary hearing, the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Special Second Court for trial. This information has been reported previously. Now, Zhang Zuming, feeling aggrieved by Zhou Jinggeng's false accusation, which led to his unjust detention and caused significant damage to his reputation and mental well-being, has hired lawyer Lu Dingkui to send a letter to Zhou Jinggeng on January 20 of this year, demanding 35,000 yuan in damages and setting a one-week deadline for a response. Zhou ignored the letter. Zhang then formally hired lawyer Lu Dingkui and others to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Tidi, Gao Guirong, Qian Genghua, and Wang Guixiang of false accusation and perjury, requesting that they be investigated according to Articles 168 and 169 of the Criminal Code, and filing a civil lawsuit to recover 50,000 yuan in damages. The court accepted the lawsuit and Judge Li Changnian was assigned to handle the case. Summons have been issued to both parties, and the trial is scheduled for 3 PM on the 13th of this month in the Second Criminal Court. After receiving the summons, Zhou Jinggeng has hired lawyer Zhang Shanle as his defense attorney and submitted a response.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhuxuan's Opium Smoking and Jia Wu's Dereliction of Duty and Cover-Up Confirmed: Public Trial Scheduled for Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan was sentenced to 15 years by the Special Second Court for instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. After the appeal was concluded, it was discovered that he had bribed a guard to induce the assassins to retract their confessions, and that three guards had accepted bribes and escaped. The prosecutor has filed a public prosecution. The defendants denied the charges during the preliminary hearing the other day. After Gu Zhuxuan was arrested, he was detained in the prison ward of the detention center, namely Guangci Hospital. It was then discovered that the director of the prison Jia Furong and the director of the detention center Wu Lu had covered up Gu's opium smoking inside the prison. This was reported by inmate Li Heshang. After investigation by the prosecutor confirmed this, Jia and Wu were charged with dereliction of duty and prosecuted by the Criminal Division of the same court. The case is scheduled for public trial by Judge Zhang Chaozuo tomorrow (the 13th) afternoon at 2 PM.</p>
<h3>A Page of Illegal Judgments by Tan Zhuohong</h3>
<p>Former Criminal Division Judge of the Shanghai District Court, Tan Zhuohong, and lawyer Yang Shaopeng were suspected of soliciting bribes. Sun collected evidence and reported them to the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry ordered Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin of the District Court Procuratorate to detain Yang Shaopeng and Tan Zhuohong successively and transfer them to the Wuxian District Court Procuratorate in Suzhou, where they were interrogated by Prosecutor Lu Wenqin and detained separately for further investigation. This has been previously reported. It has been learned that Tan Zhuohong's tenure lasted less than ten months, and some of his judgments did not comply with the law. Since this case occurred, people have been talking about it. Although criminal judges only have the power to adjudicate cases that have been legally prosecuted, they cannot convict people who have not been legally prosecuted. However, Tan Zhuohong even judged people who were not involved in the case. The following is a record of the facts of a case of disruption of family that Tan Zhuohong adjudicated the day before he was sent to Suzhou. It involves the second daughter of Zhou Junchen from Hefei (17 years old), who was seduced by Yuan Congyi from Anhui into an affair. After they fled together and were found, Zhou Junchen filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the District Court, suing only Yuan Congyi. Later, he also sued Gong Guoyu (45 years old, from Hefei). After Gong hired a lawyer to review the case file, it was discovered that the facts stated in Zhou's complaint did not implicate Gong's wife, Gong Wei (40 years old). She was clearly not among the defendants. As a result, Yuan Congyi was sentenced to six months imprisonment for intending to commit adultery and seducing a girl under the age of twenty to leave her family. Gong Wei was sentenced to six months imprisonment for intending to enable the seduction of the induced person for adultery and seducing a girl under the age of twenty to leave her family. Gong Guoyu was found not guilty. After the Gong family received the judgment, they felt wronged and filed an appeal with the Jiangsu High Court, arguing that the original trial had not investigated the matter properly and had rashly convicted them, making the judgment extremely illegal. They requested that the original judgment be overturned and a new judgment be issued, declaring them not guilty. The case is currently under appeal.</p>
<h3>British Woman Injured in Horseback Riding Accident Blames Russian Woman's Car: Both Sides Present Witnesses, Judge Orders Further Investigation</h3>
<p>British woman Lee Fava Pinet, together with her friends Jin Sun and Gu Baite, were horseback riding around 10:00 AM on November 24th last year, passing by the Hongqiao area on Route Pottier. Suddenly, a car driven by Russian woman Gleyhshiffo (Concession Registration No. 8925) came down from a bridge. Lee's horse suddenly panicked, collided with the car, and Lee fell from the horse, injuring her head and arms. She was immediately taken to Hong En Hospital for treatment. Recently, Lee Fava Pinet hired lawyer Li Baosen and filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the District Court, accusing Gleyhshiffo of negligent injury. After receiving the complaint, the court conducted a trial at the Criminal Twelfth Tribunal yesterday, presided over by Judge Lu Hongyi. An interpreter was present to translate. The plaintiff Lee Fava Pinet did not appear, but her attorney Li attended and stated the facts of the case, requesting damages of over 1,000 yuan. Next, two witnesses, Jin Sun and Gu Baite, testified, describing the circumstances of the collision. Gleyhshiffo testified that on that day, the car was driving slowly in that location, and the plaintiff's horse should have moved to the right. Furthermore, the horse's temperament was bad, causing the plaintiff's horse to collide with the car and fall. She claimed that the plaintiff was responsible for her own injuries. Entoloff, who was riding in the car with the defendant, then testified. After hearing the testimony, the judge stated that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Four Opium Smokers Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Li Hongsheng of the Yulin Road Police Station discovered at 3:45 AM on the 6th of this month that there was a private opium den near the straw shed near Lanth Road on Huade Road, selling and profiting from drugs. He worked with Western detectives and went to the location to arrest the suspects. The ringleader escaped, but four opium smokers were arrested: Sha Lao San from Shandong, Qu Jinsheng from Shanghai, Sun Shougen from Jiangbei, and Ding Axing from Anhui. They were taken to the police station along with the opium and paraphernalia and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Criminal Third Court yesterday morning and sentenced Sha Lao San, Qu Jinsheng, and Sun Shougen to four years of imprisonment each, and Ding Axing to three years, as a warning to others. Before serving their sentences, they will be sent to a drug rehabilitation hospital for detoxification for a period of one month or less. The evidence will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Jiangzhe Fishermen Unhappy With Joint Public-Private Fish Market; Representatives Appoint Zhang Shenzhi to Petition the Ministry of Industry in Beijing</h3>
<p>A report from the Shenshi News Agency states that the Ministry of Industry, concerned about the decline of the domestic fishing industry and the exploitation by fish merchants, which hinders the development of the fishing industry, initiated the establishment of the Shanghai Fish Market to provide relief. The market building was completed last year, but operations have been delayed for various reasons. Recently, the Ministry of Industry changed its original plan to a joint public-private operation, retaining the original customs and status of the fish merchants and proposing to increase commissions (the fish market regulations stipulated a 6% commission, while the past commission charged by fish merchants was 8%. Now that the fish market has been changed to a joint public-private operation, it is proposed to charge a 9% commission), increasing the burden on fish merchants. Fishermen from Jiangzhe believe that if this happens, it will not only violate the original intention and purpose of establishing the market, but also cause suffering to the entire fishing industry. They have appointed Zhang Shenzhi to represent the fishermen of Jiangzhe and travel to Beijing tomorrow to petition the authorities, express their opinions, and request the cancellation of the joint public-private operation plan.</p>

<h3>Two Die in Blaze on Central Tibet Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Two Jumped from Building, Injured</p>
<p>Xinchang Iron Shop Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>Around 7:00 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 733 Central Tibet Road (at the intersection of Xin Zha Road), the Xinchang Iron Shop. It took over an hour to extinguish. Two people were burned to death on the spot, and two who jumped from the building and fell to the ground were injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Early Morning Fire The Xinchang Iron Shop on Central Tibet Road, north of the Xin Zha Road intersection, was a double-fronted building. Besides the storefront on the ground floor, where employees and their families lived, the front and back rooms on the second floor were rented out to tenants. One was Zhang Jinxin from Jiashan, and the other was a Wang couple, both of whom had just rented the rooms. The Xinchang Iron Shop on the ground floor had also just finished renovations and had not yet officially opened for business.</p>
<p>Four Dead and Injured After the fire broke out around 7:00 AM yesterday, the residents were still asleep. When they were awakened by the crackling fire, the staircase from the second floor to the ground floor had already been burned through. At the same time, the fire and smoke obscured their vision. Zhang Jinxin and the Wang wife, who lived in the front building, saw that there was no way to escape and jumped from the windows, resulting in injuries to Zhang (foot injury) and the Wang wife (waist injury).</p>
<p>Police Investigation Wang Yuting was burned to death and collapsed on the rear staircase. A boy named Chun Gui, 11 years old, was burned on the face and rescued from the building by firefighters and sent to the hospital for treatment. However, he died due to the severity of his injuries and was transferred to the morgue. The Xinzha police station is currently investigating the cause of the fire. The Xinchang Iron Shop was completely destroyed. Fortunately, the fire did not spread to neighboring shops because the Central Fire Brigade dispatched many pump trucks to extinguish it. The Xinzha police station dispatched officers to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Quick-Witted Western Police Officer Apprehends Robber on the Run</h3>
<p>Tian Xiaowu Pretends to Be Deaf, Mute, and Insane</p>
<p>Found to Be a Repeat Offender With Twelve Previous Convictions</p>
<p>Around 6:30 PM the other day, two robbers suddenly appeared at the Shenyu Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 436 Avenue Haig. One robber acted as a lookout outside, while the other rushed into the shop, pulled out an iron pipe to resemble a gun, threatened the staff, and stole 80 yuan from the cash drawer before fleeing in different directions. Xu Yongsheng, a shop employee, immediately chased after them, shouting "Robbery!" The lookout quickly disappeared. Xu identified the robber carrying the stolen money as he fled madly. A Western detective named Martel from the Yulin Road Police Station happened to be passing by in his own car. Upon hearing the alarm, he saw the robber fleeing into Lane 460 Avenue Haig. The Western detective knew that the lane connected to Lane 262 Datong Road, so he drove directly to the entrance of Lane 262 Datong Road to wait. Sure enough, the robber came running towards him, followed by Xu Yongsheng and a passerby named Ni Jincai. The Western detective drew his gun and ordered the robber to halt, arresting him on the spot. He also found two iron pipes in the lane, but the stolen money had already been discarded. He took the robber to the Xinzha Police Station for questioning, but the robber remained silent, refusing to speak and pretending to be deaf, mute, and insane. Unable to obtain a confession or even learn his name, the detectives detained him. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the above circumstances and prosecuted him for robbery under Article 328 of the Criminal Code, stating that the police had found that the defendant was a repeat offender with twelve previous convictions. He requested a postponement for further investigation. Xu Yongsheng, an employee of the Shenyu shop, testified that the defendant had indeed threatened them with a fake gun and stolen money from the shop. Witness Ni Jincai and Western detective Martel testified about their assistance in apprehending the robber. When questioned, the defendant suddenly spoke, giving his name as Tian Xiaowu, a 34-year-old from Jiangbei and a street vendor. He claimed that he was selling sugar cane on the street yesterday and, seeing the Western detective, mistook him for an inspector checking licenses. He panicked because he was unlicensed and fled into the lane, where he was arrested. He denied the robbery. Judge Liu examined the testimony and ordered him to be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>One Wave Subsides, Another Arises: Shen Jingfen Accused Again</h3>
<p>Preliminary Hearing Yesterday, Adjourned</p>
<p>Lawyer Guo Diaomei from Minhou previously represented local woman Zhu Shenjingfen, who lived in the Ings Elementary School on Route Cardinal Mercier, in a lawsuit but was not paid his legal fees. Last month, they were involved in a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court. During the trial, their testimonies seemed to reveal a special relationship. The court ruled against Zhu, ordering her to pay Guo 600 yuan in legal fees. However, one wave subsided, and another arose. Zhu Yunwang, 59, who lived on the east street of the Dongjiadu Catholic Church, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court, requesting that his daughter-in-law Zhu Shenjingfen, 39, who currently lived at No. 6 Albert Terrace, Albert Road, have her maternal rights terminated. The complaint stated that Zhu Shenjingfen had married the plaintiff's son Shangyi in 1923. They had two sons and three daughters. After Shangyi died of illness in 1931, the defendant's behavior became improper and immoral. She had also repeatedly filed lawsuits against the plaintiff seeking alimony. On March 18, he saw a newspaper report about the trial of Guo Diaomei and the defendant's legal fees and attended the hearing, learning of a certain relationship. He now requests, in accordance with Article 1090 of the Civil Code, that the defendant's rights over the plaintiff's son be terminated and that she be declared unable to continue acting as the guardian of the plaintiff's grandchildren and exercising maternal rights. After receiving the complaint, the court held a trial yesterday morning at the Seventh Tribunal, presided over by Judge Tu Shenjie. Both father-in-law and daughter-in-law were represented by lawyers. After both parties presented their requests, the court summoned Tang Jingxian (i.e. the second concubine), a female teacher at Ings Elementary School, to testify. Tang testified that Guo Diaomei rented two rooms there in September of last year. He moved in on October 5, and a few days later, Zhu Shenjingfen moved in. Later, she went to the hospital. After she was discharged from the hospital, Guo rented another room for her. They were together during the day, but she did not know what happened at night. Two or three children lived with them, and she did not know what kind of relationship they had. The court adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 18th for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Sightseeing Flights Despite Cloudy Skies and Light Rain</h3>
<p>Since the Aviation Society of China organized the free sightseeing flights in this city, there have been many enthusiastic applicants. After the first flight on the 1st of this month at the Longhua Airport, four flights have been held in succession. Yesterday was the scheduled day for the fifth flight. It happened that the weather changed, with dark clouds covering the sky, light rain, and strong winds, resembling a cold winter day. In order to prove the safety and performance of airplanes, which can overcome weather obstacles, the Aviation Society still held the fifth flight as usual at 9:00 AM. Sixteen members participated: Ma Haoteng, Wu Zhiliang, Chen Baiqing, Chen Gengxing, Zhu Zhenhan, Zheng Duxing, Yang Changyong, Zhu Yishan, Xin Yuanhua, Chen Danru, Shen Xiu, Shen Chao, Chen Shiyou, Chen Tianlu, Huang Ruiqing, and female member Ms. Yan Rentang. Chen Buzhou and Yang Guozhu flew the training plane according to the flight schedule, performing in the rain. Everyone present praised them highly. Before the members' flight, Zhu Dong earnestly explained the relationship between airplanes and weather conditions, as well as safety issues. As a result, all the members were very excited and scrambled to board the plane, not bothered by the wind and rain. Since the Aviation Society began promoting flights, it has given the Chinese people a deeper understanding, eliminating doubts about flight safety. It is said that sightseeing flights are still available for registration. Those who wish to participate can go to the society's office at Luban Terrace on Luban Road to register.</p>
<h3>Yonghe Hall's Two Medicines Found to Contain Toxic Substances by the Health Bureau</h3>
<p>Public Prosecution Initiated by the Police</p>
<p>Medicines to Be Re-analyzed</p>
<p>Defendant Absent in Beijing</p>
<p>The Yonghe Hall Pharmacy, located at No. 23 Shunqing Lane, No. 7 Shanxi Road, is opened by Shi Yuanlong (aged 20) from Shaoxing. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau tested two medicines produced by the hall, namely "Kumquat Frost" and "Pinellia Ferment," and found that they contained toxic substances such as morphine, codeine, and nicotine. The bureau then notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau to take action. The Public Security Bureau sent a document to the First Special District Court for prosecution. President Guo immediately ordered the General Inspectorate to investigate. Chief Detective Su Changsheng ordered detectives to purchase one each of Kumquat Frost and Pinellia Cake (because Pinellia Ferment was sold out). Subsequently, a public prosecution was filed against Shi with the First Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Qian Hongye summoned the parties in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 257 of the Criminal Law. Shi Yuanlong was absent and sent a lawyer to represent him, stating that Shi had gone to Nanjing on the 7th of the month and had not yet returned to Shanghai. He had already sent a letter urging him to return to Shanghai as soon as possible to respond to the lawsuit, and requested that the case be postponed. Detective Su then submitted a report on the investigation and delivery of summons. Judge Qian ruled that because the defendant was absent, the proceedings could not continue and postponed the hearing for one week. He also handed over the medicines purchased by the police to the Shanghai Municipal Council laboratory for analysis. Police lawyer Wang requested the Municipal Health Bureau to send the previously analyzed medicines for joint analysis, fearing that the current medicines might have been tampered with by the defendant. The authorities are investigating whether the toxic substances had been removed. The court approved the request.</p>
<h3>Industrial Conditions in the Concession Last Year</h3>
<p>Economic Decline, Factories Increasingly Unsustainable</p>
<p>Investigation Completed in June</p>
<p>Over Two Thousand Three Hundred Accidents Occurred Throughout the Year</p>
<p>Safety and Hygiene Being Actively Promoted</p>
<p>According to last year's report from the Shanghai Municipal Council's factory department, the difficulties felt by the local industrial sector last year were indeed enormous. In the early months of the year, factories large and small closed down one after another. Some had temporarily recovered, but many never recovered. In addition, there were those who, under economic pressure, had no choice but to reduce working hours and wages to save costs. Those who used to work day and night now only have day shifts without night shifts. Several yarn factories, which previously operated six days and seven nights a week, have now been reduced to three days and three nights. Some have reduced wages and issued them in installments, while others have reduced wages and increased working hours. In short, they are trying to reduce costs in every possible way in order to survive.</p>
<p>As for workers who have fallen into the ranks of the unemployed due to the economic downturn, their numbers are also considerable. However, there is very little statistical data in Shanghai. Unemployment insurance, etc., has not yet been implemented, and there are no other reliable standards. Even the number of workers employed by the factories that have already closed down is almost impossible to investigate.</p>
<p>The construction of factory buildings last year was also significantly reduced compared to the previous year. Most of the houses built last year were those that had already started construction the year before and had to be completed last year. As for the factories that newly opened last year, there was one large-scale yarn factory, four large and small woolen mills, one oil paint factory, and two large breweries. These are all noteworthy factories that were established this year.</p>
<p>Measures by the Chinese Authorities On October 13th of this year, the Ministry of Industry of the Nanjing government promulgated regulations for factory safety and hygiene inspection, which was also the beginning of the second phase of the implementation of the Factory Law. These detailed rules, because of their contractual nature, can be used as a basis for future progress once the factory inspection issue is resolved. However, promoting factory safety and hygiene standards is extremely difficult. What can be done now is to publicize the practices that have been implemented and proven effective in other countries, so as to arouse awareness among people in various factories. However, how to make factory owners fully understand the management authorities still requires gradual methods and educational procedures to promote it.</p>
<p>Investigation Work Completed The investigation of factories in the International Settlement began in February 1934 and was completed in June 1935. The information obtained from this investigation is extremely useful, such as the amount and chemical composition of factory waste, the number of factory employees, etc., all of which are closely related to the work of the Public Works Department. Therefore, the investigation work was undertaken by the staff of the Public Works Department. As of the end of November, statistics show that there are 3,423 factories and workshops of all sizes in the International Settlement. In addition, three capable investigators from the Public Works Department were transferred to the factory department on July 1st. They have long had experience in various mechanical applications. After this investigation, their experience has become even more enriched. Therefore, since their transfer, they have begun their education and improvement work based on their original knowledge and special experience.</p>
<p>Overview of Industrial Accidents Although the industrial sector in the concession was affected by the economic downturn last year, the number of accidents was actually higher than the previous year. A total of 2,201 accident reports were received last year, compared to 1,788 the previous year. However, this cannot be immediately interpreted as fewer workers and more accidents, because there is no mandatory reporting system for accidents in Shanghai. Reliance is placed on the voluntary notification of factory owners, hospitals, and the police department's ambulance team. Therefore, the increase in the number of reports is not necessarily worrying. On the other hand, it means that cooperation between all parties and factory management is becoming increasingly close, which is also a sign of progress. Among the above 2,300 reports, 1,615 came from hospitals. Generally, investigations begin after receiving a report, and most factory authorities have already taken care of relief and aftercare measures without waiting for the factory department's investigation. Even those who need guidance can complete the arrangements before the second investigation. This also shows that education has been somewhat effective and that factory knowledge is gradually becoming widespread.</p>
<p>Dangerous Age and Time Last year, investigations began into the age of injured workers and the time when the most accidents occurred. It is said that among the 1,582 injured workers, 509 were under 20 years old, 313 were between 21 and 25 years old, 208 were between 26 and 30 years old, and 201 were between 31 and 35 years old. According to the above statistics, those under 20 years old account for one-third of the injured workers, and most of the ages they reported are based on the lunar calendar, so they are actually around 18 years old. It is not yet known what percentage of all workers are under 18 years old, but most of them are untrained and unpaid apprentices, which is also a matter of great concern. As for the time when accidents occur, the highest rate is between 10:00 and 11:00 in the morning, and the second highest rate is between 4:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon. This shows that the most dangerous times are after working for a certain period of time in the morning and afternoon, when people are tired and not paying much attention. In addition, fire is still the most common cause of death and injury. Last year, 113 people were injured in factories due to fire, of whom 34 died.</p>
<p>Hospitals' Efforts and Cooperation Last year, most of the accident reports came from hospitals. Because they deeply know that this kind of cooperation can reduce future accidents, they are willing to assist. However, there are occasionally those who do not understand the situation, and efforts can only be made to gradually implement it. In addition, many factory owners voluntarily report accidents. Their sincere cooperation is very helpful for the research on improving prevention methods. In addition, the police department and fire department's ambulance teams also provide good information to the factory department from time to time.</p>
<p>Promoting Factory Safety The promotion of factory safety in the concession has now moved from the experimental stage to the implementation stage in certain aspects. For example, boiler owners who had never been inspected since installation are now gradually paying attention to various aspects. Factories with potential hazards have been urged to improve their equipment. The fire at the Greater China Celluloid Toy Factory in June of last year served as a warning to factory owners. The equipment of various rubber factories has also been greatly improved. Companies that use explosive materials such as nitrocellulose, spray painting workshops that use large amounts of alcohol, and welding workshops that use acetylene lamps have all been improved one by one. The difficulty in promoting factory safety equipment in Shanghai is the lack of an industrial museum. Although it can arouse the awareness of factory managers, what can be done now is that after an accident occurs in a factory, several managers from other similar factories are gathered to visit, and instructions are given on the spot to create an impression in the minds of the visitors. In addition, there is a small-scale motor in the factory department's office with an automatic safety device, which can be used for demonstrations at any time.</p>
<p>Promoting Health and Hygiene In addition, there are some industries where, in addition to general safety issues, there are also health risks to workers. Health hazards, such as lack of light in the factory, poor air quality, and unsanitary surroundings, are also being gradually improved. In addition, the fumes emitted during chrome plating in plating workshops can be corrosive to the nose and skin. The dust sprayed in metal polishing workshops is also extremely harmful to workers' health. Last year, factory owners have tried to install gas isolation equipment. As for the improvement of factory hygiene, significant results have been achieved last year thanks to the efforts of the doctors at the Lester Institute of Medical Research and the cooperation of the Municipal Health Bureau. Last year's investigation included the living conditions of printing workers. Printing workers in Shanghai account for one-tenth of all workers, but among the 189 printing workers investigated, less than one-third were in good health, which also shows a glimpse of the workers' lives. The results of the investigation of beryllium and grinding workshops will be released soon. In addition, a considerable investigation has also been conducted on workers' meals, which will also be announced soon. Other issues, such as the living conditions, educational facilities, and labor-management coordination of workers in major factories, are also being gradually promoted.</p>
<h3>Kang Yuantai and Other Twelve Money Shops Withdraw Lawsuit Against Donglai Bank</h3>
<p>Originally Scheduled for Trial Yesterday Afternoon, Silver and Money Industries Appointed as Mediators to Reach a Settlement</p>
<p>Donglai Agrees to Pay Interest and Sign a New Contract</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order on November 3 last year to unify the currency system, many money shops in Shanghai that sell bank note vouchers with issuing rights (i.e., banknotes) have been unilaterally canceling the contracts signed between the two parties for receiving vouchers, citing the Ministry's order. This has aroused opposition from the voucher-receiving money shops and even led to lawsuits in court. This type of case has been repeatedly reported in newspapers recently. Now, Bao Kang Yuantai and other twelve money shops previously signed a contract with Donglai Bank for receiving and selling Central Bank note vouchers, with the amount of vouchers set at 300,000 to 500,000 per shop, totaling 2.2 million. The effective period of the contract and the amount of interest were clearly stated in the contract. Unexpectedly, the bank also thought of following suit and wanted to abolish the contract before the contract period expired. Bao Kang and other twelve shops all believed that the amount of vouchers issued was huge. If they were allowed to unilaterally abolish the contract, they would be unwilling to suffer losses in vain. They unanimously hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Donglai Bank to confirm the validity of the contract and request payment of interest. The trial was originally scheduled to be held by Judge Xu Gongdian at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. However, the silver and money industries were concerned that the two parties might go to extremes, so they immediately appointed themselves as mediators. Donglai has now agreed to pay interest and sign a new contract. Therefore, the case has been peacefully resolved. When the court opened yesterday afternoon, the plaintiff's lawyer Zhan Jifeng appeared in court to explain the out-of-court settlement and requested permission to withdraw the lawsuit. Judge Xu approved the request.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Industry Writes to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Improve Business Ethics</h3>
<p>Cutting Corners, Selling Defective Goods, and Deceptive Sales</p>
<p>Creating Infighting Among the Industry, Resulting in Mutual Harm</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Firstly, our country's industry and commerce have entered a state of suspended animation. The crisis of collapse can be seen at any time. Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder. The reasons for this, although externally affected by the wave of the world's economic recession and internally affected by natural disasters and fires, are also due to the failure of the Chinese people to thoroughly awaken to the situation and the failure of businessmen to strictly organize a united front and take unified steps. The domestic market is declining, the purchasing power of the people is weak, and consumers have no choice but to take the path of thrift. Thrift is originally a virtue, so it is not to be criticized. However, the general industry and commerce, thinking that they can cater to social psychology, compete to cut corners in factories, striving to make their products easy to sell. In stores, they sell defective goods and mix them with good goods in order to make huge profits, glorifying them as economical commodities. This has become a common practice, and business ethics have been completely destroyed. Recently, this has become even more serious, and all kinds of false deceptions are being used to the extreme, with Shanghai being the most prominent. Taking our industry as an example, in recent years, the raw silk market has plummeted, and the price of silk and satin has fallen sharply. Therefore, the low price of silk has long been known to the general public. However, most stores still feel that this is not enough to attract customers, and they use the psychology of consumers who are greedy for cheapness to come up with various false propaganda methods to attract customers, even boasting that each foot of silk and satin is sold for one cent to several cents. Think about what silk and satin are. Even if it is cheap, it is impossible to buy a foot for one cent. Moreover, setting up a shop to do business is originally for profit. Now, there is actually a matter of buying a foot of silk and satin for one cent of national currency. In fact, if we think about it a little, it is not difficult to understand the situation. It is nothing more than using unsightly remnants of silk to sell, or selling only one or two kinds of outdated goods. As for other goods, they greatly increase the price. All kinds of methods are aimed at attracting customers. As the trend goes, others follow suit. At first, there is jealousy among the industry, then infighting among the industry, and finally slander and defamation, mutual destruction, and disputes arise. Among them, those with weaker strength are inevitably seriously injured and gradually eliminated. However, the result is nothing more than mutual harm, the only difference is the matter of time. It is extremely painful to speak of wanting to survive by this kind of suicidal behavior. The silk and satin industry is like this, and other industries can be seen in general. If this continues, what can the future be like? Chinese businessmen have always been known for their trustworthiness in the world, but now business ethics have been destroyed so much. How can we not blame the decline of foreign trade? We believe that it is appropriate to seek a reduction in costs and lower prices due to the weak purchasing power of the people. However, the reduction in costs lies in saving unnecessary consumption, not in cutting corners. The lower price of goods is not in selling defective goods and mixing them with good goods, or in false propaganda, but in being proportional to quality and guaranteed by credit. There are legitimate ways to find this. Your association leads the industry, eliminates abuses, and promotes benefits. Our company has long admired you. Now, our company, in view of the fact that business ethics are declining day by day and will be a fatal injury to all industries, in order to revive industry and commerce, we dare to write to your association, requesting that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, on the one hand, persuade all industries to deeply awaken, and from now on take unified steps, formulate uniform market prices, draft mutually beneficial industry rules, and strictly abide by them together, so as to achieve coexistence and common prosperity. On the other hand, report to the government authorities to take effective measures to ban exaggerated and false propaganda, as well as advertising and broadcasting that can destroy the industry and damage business ethics, so that customs can be changed and the industry and commerce can be opened up to a bright future in an instant. Our humble opinion is for your consideration. We hope that you will consider and forward this letter for consideration."</p>

<h3>Jin Yuanji Colludes with Hoodlums to Forge Loan Receipts for Extortion</h3>
<p>Yao Linsheng, a local resident living at No. 87 Laiyi Wharf, Dongjiadu, is 28 years old and makes a living selling straw. He is usually responsible and has saved a little money over the years of operation, but he is timid as a mouse and very weak. Two months ago, Jin Yuanji, a native of Tongzhou living at No. 13 Yong'an Street, Nanshi, colluded with hoodlums to threaten and intimidate Yao, extorting 11.8 yuan. Later, seeing that Yao was weak and easy to bully, he designed to forge a loan receipt for 50 yuan. At about 2:00 p.m. yesterday, he openly went to Yao's place with the receipt to demand payment. Yao argued that there was no reason for the debt and was beaten. After someone reported the incident, the local police officer Zhu Deming went to arrest Jin and took him to the Dongjiadu Police Station for questioning. According to Jin Yuanji's confession, he admitted to demanding money from Yao. However, he was evasive and cunning in his confession about forging the receipt, claiming extortion, and refused to admit it. The station chief believed that the case involved forging documents and fraud, and has transferred him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>A Sketch of the Civilian New Village on Damuqiao Road</h3>
<p>National News Agency reports that it is not easy to live in Shanghai. "Housing" is a very important and difficult problem to solve in the city. The rich can of course live in foreign houses and large mansions, but the poor can only live in pigeon cages and grass sheds. There is no way to think about it. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Government has facilities for the welfare of the common people. Civilian new villages have been completed in various places. Although supply cannot meet demand, it is better than nothing. When the civilian villages were first completed, the reporter originally planned to visit, but was prevented by something. Today, I had a sudden impulse and wanted to visit again, so I drove to the civilian village on Damuqiao Road. It was about 3:00 p.m. I sent a visiting card to the village office personnel, requesting a guide to visit. The director of the village, Mr. Chao Jui-sheng, received me cordially and patiently explained the details, which is admirable. The village has been established for only a little more than two months, but it has a complete scale and is exceptionally clean. It occupies more than 20 acres of land and has 168 houses, all of which have been rented out. Recently, there have been more than a dozen applications every day for rental housing without success, which shows the urgent need of the common people. The houses are divided into two types, A and B, with rents of three yuan and four yuan respectively. Each house has a small garden in front of the door, where flowers and plants can be freely planted. There are cement roads in the village, leading in all directions. The rows of houses are neat and tidy, and there is plenty of air and sunlight. The public facilities are very well-equipped. There is one sports field, two public laundry areas, one public reading room, one men's and one women's bathhouse, where you can take a bath, one men's and one women's toilet, equipped with flushing toilets, and one kitchen, providing boiling water to the villagers. There is one consumer cooperative, and the villagers are all members. There is one primary school, providing schooling for the children of the villagers. There are four classrooms and 160-170 students. More than 20 of them are from outside the village who applied for admission. When recruiting, more than 100 children from outside the village came to apply, which shows the faith of the nearby residents. Later, due to quota restrictions, only these 20 or so students were admitted. Tuition is free, and only books and school supplies cost 1.5 yuan. Pens, ink, paper, and notebooks are all distributed by the school, so the children do not have to trouble their parents to buy paper and pens. The village currently has seven staff members. Director Chao is capable and responsible. Even on holidays, he is still immersed in work, and he is always amiable. When the villagers see him, they greet him with a smile and call him "Sir," expressing their love and respect. When Director Chao accompanied the reporter to visit each house, the children all surrounded him, smiling and calling "Hello, Sir, good morning, Sir," lively and very cute. The reporter could not help but smile. The staff members also often visit the homes of the villagers to guide them in cleanliness and hygiene. The villagers are willing to listen, so everyone is happy and harmonious. They also run a civilian night school, so that the villagers have the opportunity to study in their spare time, thereby eliminating illiteracy among the villagers. The village will implement a baojia system to cultivate the villagers' ability to self-govern. They have also held several village meetings to train them and create a sound personality and an environment where doors are not closed at night and no one picks up lost items on the road. Director Chao said, "We hope that the villagers can fully govern themselves, so that we can go to other places to create new villages, because we now feel that there is a greater need for new villages in Shanghai. At the same time, we also feel that the responsibility is too great. The success or failure of the new village undertaking is on the shoulders of our staff. The success or failure of the new village is deeply related to the lives of the common people, so we welcome people from all walks of life to visit, criticize, and guide, so that the new village undertaking will develop day by day." By the way, the civilian villages on Damuqiao Road and Zhongshan Road are "full." There are "few remaining places" in the civilian villages on Qimei Road and Pushan Road. Here is another request. The reporter would like to ask the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Management of Civilian Welfare Undertakings to quickly add several, dozens, or even hundreds of civilian new villages to "universally save" the "common people" in pigeon cages and grass sheds.</p>
<h3>Regulations of the Central Savings Association Filed and Ready</h3>
<p>The Central Savings Association, specially approved by the National Government, is funded with 5 million yuan from the Central Trust Bureau to continue managing the color savings institutions that have been taken over, such as the Sino-French Savings Association, so that the interests of depositors are safely guaranteed. It is reported that the association has formulated preferential regulations for depositors and submitted them to the National Government for filing. For example, those who previously paid 15 yuan per month in the Sino-French Savings Association only had a special prize of 10,000 yuan. Now, according to the association's regulations, those who pay 12 yuan per month have the hope of winning 15,000 yuan per month. Moreover, the association currently has less than 50,000 numbers participating in the lottery, so depositors have many chances of winning. In addition, depositors have the hope of winning the lottery every month in the 15th year, even if they do not pay. There are also various other preferential measures, such as depositors who prepay savings for half a year or a year can enjoy the right to pay less. As for the association's method of calculating dividends, it is designed to benefit depositors everywhere. Therefore, the dividends that depositors receive when they repay the principal are also more generous than elsewhere, and the number of repayments that depositors receive when they withdraw from the association is also more than other savings associations. Because the association has sufficient funds and is operated by the state, it is only aimed at encouraging national savings and not at making profits. Therefore, the preferential measures that have been formulated are absolutely unique to the institutions operated by private individuals in the past. It is expected that the association's business will flourish after it opens.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Securities Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit</p>
<p>(Seventeenth in the Series on the General Situation of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>The Securities Industry in the Era of Associations—The so-called securities industry in the era of associations refers to the era of the Shanghai Stock Business Association, which was also the predecessor of the current Chinese Securities Exchange. From its establishment to its reorganization, it lasted six years. The number of members increased from thirteen to more than fifty, excluding non-members and small money shops engaged in securities trading. The emergence of this association was indeed created by the situation. Because of stock trading, starting from the issuance of domestic public bonds such as the six-percent and eight-percent bonds in the first year of the Republic, as well as the nationalization of the Su-Zhe Railway, business was booming for a time. The profits of stock brokers were considerable. As a result, the number of people concurrently engaged in this stock business increased from six or seven to double that. Transactions became more frequent and competition became more intense. Therefore, there was a feeling that trading at tea parties was inconvenient, and thus the formation of this association occurred. The fact that Western merchants in Shanghai had already established such an organization was also a reason for its emergence. (The Western merchants' organization was the Shanghai Sharebrokers' Association, commonly known as the Shanghai Stock Association. The English name is Shanghai Sharebrokers’ Association. The association was established in the seventeenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. In the thirty-first year of the Guangxu reign, it was reorganized as Shanghai Stock Exchange in accordance with the Hong Kong government's Limited Company Ordinance and named Shanghai Public Industry Association in Chinese. At that time, the trading of rubber stocks was extremely prosperous, and many Chinese merchants in Shanghai were engaged in this type of buying and selling). The association applied to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce for approval and registration and established its office in Weishui Fang, Jiujiang Road. Its organization adopted a chairman system, with one chairman and one vice-chairman. The chairman presided over the association's affairs, and the vice-chairman assisted in everything. There were also several directors to support the deficiencies of the chairman. The term of office of the chairman was one year, and they were responsible for promoting the association's affairs. At the beginning of its establishment, the number of members was very small, with only about thirteen. At that time, the progress of business was gradual, and the association's expenses were large, making it difficult to maintain. Therefore, membership fees were collected in four grades according to the size of the members' business scope. Grade A paid 24 yuan per month, Grade B 20 yuan, Grade C 12 yuan, and Grade D 6 yuan. Grades A and B were designated as sustaining members, and Grades C and D as ordinary members. Later, as the number of members increased and the business expanded, the grading of membership fees was no longer applicable. As for the layout of the association's market, the gathering time was initially set from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day. At the same time, two commission standards were established to show great credibility.</p>
<p>A. Registered securities, such as company stocks, required procedures such as reviewing tickets, establishing stock transfer documents, and finding store guarantees. The procedures were cumbersome, the risks were high, and sometimes unexpected disputes occurred. Therefore, the collection of commissions was relatively high, charging one yuan or five dimes per hundred yuan of face value.</p>
<p>B. Unregistered securities, such as public bonds, had simple procedures and could be traded immediately. Therefore, the collection of commissions was relatively low, charging two dimes and five cents per hundred yuan of face value. After the end of the daily gathering time, the association compiled a market quotation sheet of the daily trading prices and distributed it to the colleagues present. As for the business scope, the association also defined it as two types according to custom. A, Spot trading. All spot transactions belonged to this. B, Entrusted trading. For larger transactions, customers could specify the price and entrust members to trade on the market. This type of transaction was concluded in the afternoon after the agreement, which is commonly known as agency trading. At that time, the types of business were more than doubled compared to the previous month. Although the transaction figures were far less than the current ones, by the seventh year of the Republic, the European War was in full swing and domestic enterprises were booming. The government continued to issue various public bonds, such as seven-year short-term, seven-year long-term, and financial bonds. At that time, credit was solid, and people invested enthusiastically. Banks also had demand for them as reserves. As a result, securities trading increased day by day, and the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange came into being. Now, I will describe its detailed situation as follows.</p>
<p>The exchange was established in the ninth year of the Republic by Fan Jimei, Sun Tieqing, Zhang Wenhuan, and others. The main business was government-issued public bonds and treasury bills, supplemented by stocks of companies and firms. It recruited fifty-five brokers. At that time, the capital was only 200,000 yuan, divided into 10,000 shares, each share worth 20 yuan. Initially, the business premises were leased. Two years later, as the business developed, the capital was increased to 500,000 yuan. In the eleventh year, it was further increased to 1 million yuan and proceeded to elect Sun Tieqing as chairman of the board of directors in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law. (The founder Fan Jimei had withdrawn due to circumstances). Zhang Wenhuan was the standing director. Xia Luping, Yu Ziyi, Chen Lanting, Yin Yunsheng, Wang Benzi, Yao Yinpeng, Gu Shumei, Yuan Songfan, and Li Lianbo were directors. Mo Xinglin and Xue Zhusun were supervisors. At the same time, the scope gradually expanded, and the internal organization became sound. It was divided into four departments: General Affairs, Calculation, Venue Affairs, and Accounting, each responsible for its own affairs. In the thirteenth year, land was purchased and a new three-story building was built at 15 Hankou Road (now changed to 422). On the day of completion, it encountered the "96" typhoon. Business plummeted, almost bordering on bankruptcy. At that time, Chairman Sun Tieqing also left office due to illness and was succeeded by Zhang Wenhuan. This was the most desolate and depleted period of the exchange. By the sixteenth year, the National Government had established its capital in Nanjing. Due to the enormous financial needs of military and political expenses, various bonds exceeding tens of thousands of yuan were continuously issued. The exchange relied entirely on the exchange to circulate and turn over the funds. As a result, the business was booming and prospering. As of the second half of the twenty-third year, the income from handling fees reached 1,315,097.27 yuan in national currency. The shareholders' dividends exceeded seven percent. The market value of a stock with a face value of 20 yuan reached 74 yuan, setting a record not seen in previous years. This was the exchange's heyday. Although it was affected by the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, the trading was once sluggish, but it was still vastly different from before the sixteenth year. In the summer of the twenty-first year, in response to the needs of the times, four directors and one supervisor were added. At the same time, due to the narrow market and the inadequacy of the old buildings, it was decided to allocate 1 million yuan to build an eight-story building on the original site in accordance with the resolution of the shareholders' meeting in the twentieth year, and to expand the common base and reclaim all the rooms in the securities alley. It was completed in a year and named "Securities Building". A real estate management department was also established to manage the leasing affairs. On June 1, in the twenty-second year, in compliance with the law, it merged with the securities section of the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange, and increased the capital by 200,000 yuan and added twenty-five brokers (totaling eighty brokers). The number of staff was also greatly increased, with a total of more than 140 employees. The scale and prosperity of the transactions were above those of all exchanges. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Passing of the Premier and the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, and there will surely be a solemn commemoration throughout the country.</p>
<p>Recalling the Premier's lifetime, in addition to dedicating himself to the national revolution and saving the liberation of the Chinese nation, he spared no effort in promoting national products. I remember that in his lectures on the Three Principles of the People's Nationalism, the Premier said: "Our China, in addition to suffering from the political aggression of the great powers, has also suffered from economic aggression. The so-called economic aggression is the import of foreign goods, which robs our China of money every year, totaling more than 500 million yuan. Therefore, we must not only pay attention to the tangible political aggression of the great powers, but also pay attention to their intangible economic aggression..." In this passage of his speech, Mr. Sun implied the importance of promoting and using national products.</p>
<p>It has been a full eleven years since Mr. Sun's death! How effective has our promotion of national products been? What are the results of using national products? This is still a question worth reflecting on. Although the movement to promote national products has been shouted for five or six years, no matter how much you criticize in words and writing, the compatriots throughout the country still cannot achieve the point of using mostly national products. This is an obvious fact. I sincerely hope that when everyone commemorates the death of the Premier today, they will carefully recall Mr. Sun's words, study them, and resolve to use national products. That is the true meaning of commemoration.</p>
<h3>During the Peak Period of Tung Oil Exports, Chinese People Should Quickly Plan to Plant Tung Trees</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Promoting national products is not limited to persuading domestic people to use them. It is also important to pay attention to overseas trade. In the past, our country relied on silk and tea as major exports. Now, these two items have plummeted to a failed state, due to sticking to old methods, not knowing how to improve, and other countries trying their best to imitate them. This is truly a deep sigh! However, from last year to the present, the export of tung oil has suddenly increased sharply. This cannot be called a somewhat satisfactory thing. According to customs statistics, the value of exports in January this year was 37,344,341 yuan, and the value of imports was 35,952,268 yuan, with a surplus of 1,392,073 yuan. The export of tung oil reached 8,566,256 yuan, also ranking first among the various exports in this session (the total number of tung oil exports last year has been seen in this publication and will not be repeated). It can be seen that tung oil is urgently needed by various countries for military and scientific purposes today. We must not ignore it! At present, the export of various goods is declining, and tung oil alone has an advantage. It is used to slightly plug the loopholes, which is a good phenomenon for the future of national products and a very gratifying thing. However, we must take advantage of this period to promote the planting of tung trees.</p>
<p>Specifically, the best way to do this is for the government to issue a notice to planting farms and villagers throughout the country, urging them to plant tung oil trees as soon as possible, and to stipulate reward measures for those with good yields, so that farmers are happy to plant. Fortunately, there are many open fields everywhere in our country, or due to geological reasons, it is not suitable for planting sorghum, so tung trees can be planted instead. Moreover, tung trees are easier to grow and profit from than other kinds of trees. However, the selection of seedlings must be careful, and good varieties should be selected, so that after they grow up, they can bear heavy tung fruits and extract a large amount of tung oil. However, everything should be done quickly, not slowly! The reason is that recently, other countries, seeing the high profits from planting tung trees, are studying and trying to plant them. I hope that the Chinese people will make early efforts to cultivate and improve them, hoping that the products will be excellent, the quality will be increased, and the exports will increase indefinitely. This is the only way to promote domestic products, recover profits, and maintain rights.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching the Demonstration of the Jinlong Fire Extinguishing Bomb (Made in China)</h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>Recently, there have been several demonstrations of fire extinguishing bombs in Shanghai. It is said that if a fire accidentally breaks out in your home, as long as the fire has not penetrated the roof, you can throw the fire extinguishing bomb at the source of the fire, and it will be extinguished immediately. We know that the first fire extinguishing bombs to arrive in Shanghai were made in Germany! But soon after, domestically produced fire extinguishing bombs appeared on the market.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Jinlong brand fire extinguishing bomb, manufactured by Lizhong Industrial Company, was recently demonstrated again at the Daji Road public stadium in the Nanshi area on February 27th and 28th. After learning of the fire extinguishing bomb demonstration, I made a special trip to the stadium on the afternoon of the 27th to observe. Because the Jinlong fire extinguishing bomb is indeed very effective, I am happy to introduce it to the readers of this publication after seeing it, and also express some of my thoughts after watching.</p>
<p>This type of fire extinguishing bomb is six inches tall and eleven and a half inches in circumference. The outside is a blue glass shell, and the inside is filled with liquid. Because it is installed using a vacuum method, the liquid will never change or dry out as long as the glass shell is not broken. The liquid inside is a white, transparent liquid composed of various gases. In the event of a fire, the bomb is thrown into the fire, the shell breaks, and the liquid flows out. When it encounters heat, it evaporates into a non-flammable gas. This gas is nine times heavier than air, and its vaporized volume is three thousand times greater. It has extremely strong expansion and pressure-reducing properties, so it can quickly extinguish the fire. In non-open spaces, such as inside buildings with walls, even if the volume is large, this bomb can be thrown to extinguish the fire, and the speed of extinguishing the fire is even unbelievable!</p>
<p>During the demonstration, a small wooden house was first built, with cotton clothes and wood shavings underneath, all soaked in oil. The walls were also covered with kerosene. After the fire was lit, the fire in the small house immediately became fierce and uncontrollable. While the fire was raging, a representative was invited from among the guests to throw the fire extinguishing bomb into the flames. It was truly unbelievable that such a fierce fire was extinguished immediately upon encountering the smell of the fire extinguishing liquid. Then another demonstration was conducted, and the second fire was even fiercer than the first, but it was also extinguished by the fire extinguishing bomb. The people who watched the demonstration were all amazed by this scene!</p>
<p>However, according to people from the company, the use of this fire extinguishing bomb must be done correctly in order to be effective. Special attention should be paid to the following: It should be thrown from a low position towards the hardest part of the flame that is highest and strongest in order to see immediate results. Because the stronger the flame, the faster the vaporization of the liquid. The higher the throw, the greater the pressure reduction of the gas. As for the hard surface, it is easier to break the shell, so the effect is even faster. Do not throw it on places where the fire is very small or has not yet caught fire, because the liquid cannot be vaporized and cannot exert its fire extinguishing effect. Do not throw it from above or throw it too low, so that the gas loses its natural pressure-reducing and fire extinguishing function. Do not throw it in open fields or in rooms where the flames have penetrated the roof, because the gas will dissipate and cannot extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>After watching the successful demonstration of the fire extinguishing bomb, I feel that in places where fire-fighting equipment is inadequate, it is even more necessary to purchase this type of fire extinguishing bomb. In rural areas or small towns, we often hear that due to the lack of fire-fighting equipment, a fire in one house can burn down many others. Therefore, in the inland areas, if there is a lack of fire-fighting equipment, the fire extinguishing bomb can remedy the inability to extinguish the fire. To prevent a small spark from starting a prairie fire, it is highly recommended that every household purchase a few fire extinguishing bombs. However, on the other hand, we know that each Jinlong fire extinguishing bomb costs four yuan in legal tender. It seems that the economic ability of ordinary people, in rural areas with bankruptcy and cities with economic depression, is not enough to buy three or five fire extinguishing bombs to store at home for fire prevention. Therefore, if fire extinguishing bombs are to be promoted to the inland areas, it seems that the price should be reduced. I wonder what Lizhong Company thinks about this?</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editors:</p>
<p>Having read the article "The Invention of the Spring Abacus" in your esteemed publication, issue 154, dated March 5th, I am grateful for Mr. Sun's praise of the original creator, as well as the editor's notes and promotion. However, the large abacus that Mr. Sun saw may have been made in a foreign country. Twenty years ago, some primary schools in our country purchased and used them. (The number was extremely small.) The beads and columns of that large abacus were made of copper wire. When the beads were moved, the copper wire was soft and easily bent, so it could not move up and down freely. The tubular spring of thin copper sheet was set inside the bead hole. Because the bead was made of wood, the wood naturally shrank in the dry air after a short period of use, and the bead hole became larger. As a result, the spring and the bead separated, and the abacus became useless. That large abacus had these two major shortcomings, so its sales were not smooth in the market, and it soon disappeared. As for the spring bead abacus created by Junping, it is completely different from that spring abacus. The column posts are made of rosewood and are square. A hole is drilled in each bead to install a spring. When it is set on the column post, the spring post touches each other, and it does not fall. It can be moved up and down easily and effortlessly. Moreover, the spring is hidden inside the bead, so the spring device is never seen on the outside. Therefore, there is no danger of falling off, and there is no possibility of weakened elasticity or rust. The Industrial Technology Examination Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce evaluated this spring bead abacus as "the large abacus in schools today, whether using bristle columns or string lines, is not as convenient." Subsequently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued Patent Certificate No. 27, granting a five-year patent. Also, the National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Department Achievement Exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Education last year, was also sent to participate in the exhibition. The general evaluation report said: "Mr. Ling's spring bead abacus is a high-quality product that is practical and should be encouraged and promoted." Subsequently, the Ministry of Education gave a Class A certificate of merit and ordered the educational administrative authorities of all provinces and cities in the country to instruct their affiliated primary schools to adopt it. This spring bead abacus is divided into two types, A type with twenty-one columns and B type with seventeen columns. All Shanghai Commercial Press branches sell it.</p>
<p>Your publication has spared no effort in promoting domestic products, which is admirable. Because Mr. Sun's description and Junping's invention are not the same thing, I am deeply afraid that people will mistakenly think that Junping is imitating a foreign product and pretending to be an inventor, which will cause suspicion among buyers. Therefore, I do not hesitate to write this letter to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings! I sincerely hope that your publication will publish this letter immediately to clarify the truth and avoid misunderstandings! With best wishes to Mr. Yang Yao and Mr. Ji Ping.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Ling Junping, 253.7</p>

<h3>International Basketball First Night: China Defeats the United States by One Point</h3>
<p>The Chinese Team's Excellent Coordination Causes the American Military to Yield</p>
<p>Russian and Philippine Teams Win in Group B, Finals Scheduled</p>
<p>The annual International Basketball Championship opened last night at the Shen Yuan Ball Room. There were three matches in total. The first two were Group B matches, and the results were that Jewish and Korean teams were eliminated, while the Philippine and Russian teams qualified for the finals. The above two teams will hold the finals the day after tomorrow (Saturday). The finale was the Group A match between China and the United States. China relied on excellent coordination to defeat the United States by one point. The game was exceptionally exciting. The Group A match will be played in a best-of-three format and there will be two matches to compete in, scheduled for the day after tomorrow and next Wednesday. The details of yesterday's game are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>China Takes the Lead with Powerful Momentum. Last night, the wind and rain were bleak, and there were few people in the Shen Yuan Ball Room. After the opening ceremony, in the two Group B matches, the Russian team's victory over the Korean team was exceptionally crisp. In particular, Russian center Qiao Bailuofu scored 21 points alone, being the mainstay of the team. In the second match, the Philippine team's victory over the Jewish team was due to the Philippine players' accurate shooting, especially their expertise in long shots. When the Group A match between China and the United States took the stage, the number of spectators who gathered reached more than 300. The American military fought with a team of pure-blooded Malling soldiers. Our team attended with Feng, Yin, Xu, Wang and Cai. After the selection of positions was completed, the American military attacked first. They circled twice, and there were no gains. The front was exceptionally dull. The ball turned to Cai Yanxiong's hand, who was about to advance, but Yin Guiren was penalized for a foul. Mao Fei made a free throw and scored, and the record was first opened by the American military. Moments later, American center Gliffin was also heard to have committed a foul, Xu Heng executed the free throw, and the score was tied at one to one. In less than half a minute, Wang Nanzhen got Feng Nianhua's pass and scored a long shot. Yanxiong and Nianhua also made successive achievements. Xu Heng made another free throw and scored a point. The Chinese team took a shocking lead of eight to one. Looking back at the American front, it was exceptionally chaotic and difficult to resist.</p>
<p>The Situation is Tense and the Score is Tied. Ten minutes after the game, the American military replaced Kaifushi with the pirate main general Carson. With someone in the American backfield, the lineup was refreshed. Braes made contributions on the front line, advancing two points. The Chinese team's momentum was still powerful, and there were many shooting opportunities, but unfortunately none of them hit the target. At this time, the American military requested a timeout to discuss war strategies in secret. Chinese generals Gao, Cai, Xu, Yin, and Feng retired one after another and were replaced by fresh troops such as Sun, Qiu, Kuang, and Xu. Wang Nanzhen moved like a freed rabbit, like beads on a plate, and jumped in the middle, winning thunderous applause. Before long, Carson and Wen Kui each scored a goal, making the score twelve to five. China still led by seven points. The American military then sent Benate on the court, and sure enough, the momentum was extraordinary. Working with Carson, they coordinated successfully and made successive achievements, gaining six points in total, chasing the score to twelve to eleven, only one point behind. China then replaced Yao Ya with Zhen Yuan. Han Dengchang immediately made a miraculous contribution. The American military also sent Shi Guiya on the court. Qin Sheng and Bainaite made one free throw and one throw, actually chasing the score to a 14-14 tie. In a split second, the break time had arrived, and the two sides were evenly matched.</p>
<p>A One-Point Difference Leads to the American Military's Defeat. In the first half, the Chinese team was chased to a tie despite having the best advantage. After the restart, our team still sent Xu Qiu and Sun onto the court, and Zhou Guoyun was transferred out to assist. The situation changed. The American military responded with Lai, Ka, Bai, Pi, and Shi, forming a pure pirate formation. But the Chinese team moved in one go. Nanzhen and Wen Kui came and went, running around the field, as if in an uninhabited land. Nanzhen made three throws, Wen Kui made two throws, and Da Yun added three free throws. The Chinese team added eleven points in a row. The American military sent Breith on the court and only scored two points, making the score 27 to 16. The audience in the four seats were all overjoyed. At this time, the American military line underwent major changes. Laine, Pinsell, Qin Sheng, and Breith scored in succession, rising rapidly, and in a split second, the score was chased to 28 to 29, in great danger. Qin Sheng made another throw and was actually overtaken by the American military with a score of 30 to 29, leading by one point. At this time, there were less than two minutes left to the end of the game, and the tension reached its peak. Finally, because the tall man Laine committed two consecutive fouls, Cai Yanxiong made a free throw and scored, chasing the score to a tie. Feng Nianhua made another free throw and scored a goal, surpassing by one point with a score of 31 to 30. Before long, time was up. China defeated the American military by a difference of one point. The lineups of the two sides are as follows:</p>

<h3>European Situation May Affect the World Games</h3>
<p>Our Country is Still Preparing as Usual</p>
<p>Germany Abrogates the Locarno Treaty, the European situation has suddenly become tense, leading to suggestions from certain countries to refuse to participate in the Olympic Games to be held in Berlin this August. The British World Games Committee has also automatically stopped raising funds, etc. The reporter asked Shen Siliang, the honorary director of the Chinese National Sports Association, about this. According to him, it is not yet known whether the World Games will undergo changes or be aborted halfway. Our country is still proceeding with preparations as planned. As for what the future holds, it will depend on the future situation. The reporter also inquired at the German Consulate in this city, but did not receive a reply. Judging from the current European situation, the future of the World Games is truly worrying.</p>

Yesterday was the final week of the competition, with a total of four matches. The women's group was between Qixiu and Ludi. Both teams had not been defeated, so this battle was to resolve the championship. Both sides fought cautiously. Judging from the past records of the two teams, the strength was between equals. Unexpectedly, in yesterday's game, the Ludi forwards were like a storm, coordinating their offense, constantly threatening Qixiu. Although Yan Weiwen and Wen Yuan tried their best to resist, they still felt overwhelmed. At the end of the first half, Ludi defeated Qixiu 32 to 12. In the second half, Ludi became more active. Zhang Minzhi, He Miaoying, and Liu Hui scored repeatedly, accumulating points. Although Qixiu knew they were no match, they still worked hard to fight back. By the time the game ended, the final result was that Ludi defeated Qixiu 69 to 26, winning the women's group championship. The results of yesterday's game and all the results are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Little Men (1) (9) (7)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Everything became quiet again. Suddenly, they heard three light knocks on the wall. Granny Grey showed fear, but before she could remember to say, "What's the matter?" (Note 6), the back of the yellow paper stove suddenly opened, and the fairy godmother finally squeezed her body and a pointed hat out of the doorway. This was Nan En dressed up, wearing a red robe, a small hat, and carrying a fairy wand, waving it while firmly saying:</p>
<p>"You must go, my dear."</p>
<p>Granny Grey dragged her yellow robe and replied, "Now you have to pull, show my beautiful clothes."</p>
<p>"No, no, you have to say, 'How can I go in ragged clothes?'" the godmother replied in her own voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, really, I should say that;" so the girl actually said it again, unperturbed by her forgetting.</p>
<p>"Because you are good, I have turned your clothes into a beautiful outfit," the godmother said, using a theatrical tone, and slowly removed the tan chest covering, finally revealing a dazzling scene.</p>
<p>The little girl was beautiful enough to move many young hearts, because her mother had dressed her up like a beautiful flower, wearing a rose-colored silk dress, a satin skirt, and small flowers inserted here and there, which was pleasing to the eye. The godmother placed a crown covered with scarlet and pure white feathers on her head and gave her a pair of silver paper dancing shoes. She put them on, stood up, picked up the hem of her skirt, showed the shoes to the audience, and said proudly, "My new shoes, aren't they beautiful?" (Note 7)</p>
<p>She was now beside herself with joy, and it was hard to make her remember that she was a character in the play. Later, she finally asked:</p>
<p>"But I have no carriage, godmother." (Note 8)</p>
<p>"Look!" En waved her fairy wand so vigorously that she almost knocked off the little girl's crown. At this point, the biggest highlight of the whole play was revealed, first seeing a thick rope on the stage board.</p>
<p>(Note 6) The sound error of "What is this?"</p>
<p>(Note 7) New! New</p>
<p>(Note 8) Carriage! Car Godmother! Godmother</p>

<h3>Securities: Many Retail Investors Exit, Public Bonds Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>—Only Class A Long-Term and 96 Stability—</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the decline gradually intensified, largely influenced by rumors regarding the Fujian Incident. The selling pressure from the 4th and 11th issues further exacerbated the situation, with numerous retail investors closing out their long positions and selling off, causing the market price to return to the midpoint between its highest and lowest points. Based on the overall environment, a small continuation seems likely, but not one driven by bullish rallies, as trading volume remains limited, making prices susceptible to both declines and increases. The market atmosphere was weak from the opening bell yesterday, with both the 4th and 11th issues joining the selling side, showing extremely weak momentum. They fell by about half a yuan or so. The selling pressure remained strong in the subsequent session, with the 13th, 14th, 20th, and 43rd issues also being sold off, resulting in a further drop of thirty or forty cents. At the opening bell of the afternoon session, although the 4th issue saw some buying interest, the market sentiment became even more sluggish. The March Class B issue fell by as much as eighty cents, with the remaining issues also falling by small amounts of thirty to fifty cents. The 11th issue saw some buying back at the close, but the overall trend remained uninspired. Only the Class A issue maintained its original price, while the remaining issues continued to fall by small amounts of twenty or thirty cents. Throughout the entire day, the trend was consistently downward from morning to evening. Only the 96 issue remained stable without gains or losses. Ultimately, market prices continued to fall by about ninety and a half cents to one and a half yuan. The total trading volume amounted to 5.97 million yuan. The resulting price changes are compared and listed in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>US Industrial Stocks Rise Most Sharply</h3>
<p>Report from Sin Feng Trading Company. Yesterday (the 10th), the New York stock market rebounded by one to five yuan, led by automotive, petroleum, and agricultural machinery stocks.

At noon, short sellers aggressively sold off in an attempt to test the market, but prices showed strong resistance and were not swayed, leading to new buying interest. Subsequently, the market gradually advanced. Steel stocks rose due to the positive earnings report of the Ward Steel Company. Copper stocks rose in tandem with copper prices. Chemical, railroad, and utility stocks also rebounded with the market. Power and light stocks showed significant manipulation by bullish companies. Airline stocks were relatively firm. Small exchanges and the unlisted market both rose. Total daily trading volume reached 2.33 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Active Spot Sales, Yarn Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Long-Term Contracts Approach the 210 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The yarn market has turned firm, with a rampant bullish surge. This is due to active spot yarn sales recently, a significant shortage of Japanese yarn futures, and an overall upward trend in overseas cotton yarn conditions, boosting market confidence. The financial community has not moved its position, but the industry remains in a short position. Osaka Sampin yarn futures soared by 2.6 to 3 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Floating Shorts Cover Painfully</p>
<p>At the opening bell of the marked yarn futures market, prices for all months jumped higher across the board. With Osaka Sampin yarn remaining firm and the bullish surge intensifying, floating shorts, recognizing the favorable environment, covered their positions painfully, making the situation increasingly tight. Spot yarn sales developed, causing market prices to rise step by step, with distant months approaching 210 yuan. As a result, prices for all months rose by 1.5 to 2.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market sentiment was quite strong at the opening bell of the afternoon session. There were reports of spot yarn shortages and sharp increases in asking prices, while Osaka Sampin yarn remained weak and sentiment was still good. However, after the second session, some long positions were taken profits, and trading slightly declined. By the close, spot yarn transactions with customers reached over 2,200 bales, with futures turning firm. As a result, prices for all months rose by 3, 4, or 7 cents compared to the afternoon closing price. Sales included 750 bales from Deda, 1,250 bales from Jinchang, 2,050 bales from Shenqi, 700 bales from Yuan Yi, 1,050 bales from Changfeng, 1,550 bales from Xincheng, 800 bales from Jin Kang, 1,150 bales from Da Feng, 4,050 bales from Hexing, and 800 bales from Xiecheng. Purchases included 650 bales from Xinhua, 600 bales from Hengchang, 850 bales from Tongji, 1,450 bales from Da Feng, 600 bales from Zhen Da, 650 bales from Mingde, 1,300 bales from Geng Feng, 3,250 bales from Tai Chang, 1,300 bales from Run Kang, 600 bales from Yu Da, 1,550 bales from Sen Kang, 800 bales from Yi Da, and 700 bales from Tong He. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Soars by 3-4 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are active, with a total of 2,215 bales purchased by various groups throughout the day, according to statistics. Selling prices saw Japanese yarn soar by 3-4 yuan, and local yarn rise by 2 yuan. Purchase amounts by various groups are listed below.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Cotton Futures Rise Above the 5 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The Jin market rose sharply due to the firmness of US cotton and the steady rise of Osaka Sampin cotton. The outlook for US cotton remains positive, with continued upside potential. At the same time, spot cotton consumption is brisk, and inventories in various producing areas are dwindling daily, so the market is trending upward and its actual position is not easily loosened.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Rises Strongly by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton futures market, prices for all months soared across the board. US cotton rose by 3 to 9 points due to purchases by spot traders and New Orleans buyers. Indian cotton fell by only 0.75 to 1.75 rupees, less than expected from the previous day. Osaka Sampin cotton rose by 5, 6, and 7 cents. This shook market sentiment, and buying interest was strong. Da Chang He suddenly made large-scale purchases, while spot cotton selling prices were brisk and new selling was scarce, pushing long-term futures above the 5 yuan mark. As a result, prices for all months rose by half a yuan to six or seven cents compared to the previous month's closing price. The market atmosphere remained tense at the opening of the afternoon session, but spot cotton merchants continued to exert pressure on nearby months, and some long positions were also sold off. Prices turned weaker in the second session. As a result, prices for all months fell by five cents to one cent compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 4,000 dan from Da Changcheng, 2,000 dan from Tongji, 4,600 dan from Zhen Da, 5,800 dan from Shen Ji, 3,400 dan from Yuan Yi, 1,900 dan from Mingde, 1,300 dan from Hexing, 1,800 dan from Geng Feng, and 2,200 dan from Yongda. Purchases included 4,200 dan from Yi Chang, 4,500 dan from Yu Da, 9,500 dan from Da Feng, 2,300 dan from Da Ji, 2,200 dan from Xing Chang, 3,000 dan from Tong He, 3,900 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, and 5,600 dan from Chang He. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Mills Open Wide</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains strong, with all mills actively purchasing. Selling prices are particularly brisk. Supplies include 200 bales of Yao cotton, it is said.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Recovers at the Close</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened quietly, with prices for all months remaining unchanged to falling by one point. At the beginning of the morning session, due to uncertainty in the international political situation, traders offered March-term stored cotton, and many long positions in old cotton were closed out and sold short, creating significant unease. Subsequently, limited quantities of old cotton were bought at a fixed price, and brokers and foreign firms bought new cotton, causing market prices to gradually firm. However, most traders were still awaiting developments in Washington. According to a report from the Ministry of Agriculture, global cotton production in February of this year was 26,000,000 bales, compared to 23,600,000 bales in the same period last year. The close was firm, with spot prices rising by three points and futures rising by three to nine points. British cotton spot prices fell by nine points and futures rose by one or two points. A small number of short sales of Indian cotton were absorbed by speculative buyers, followed by further purchases by Japanese firms and speculators. As a result, Pingguoer fell by 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 1 to 1.75 rupees, and Bailuofu fell by 1.5 to 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (telegram of the 10th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 11th was 198 rupees, an increase of 2.25 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Sampin Yarn and Cotton Firm and Rising</h3>
<p>Telegram from Osaka on the 11th: Sampin yarn futures rose by 2.6 to 3.1 yuan, with the nearby month at 193.6 yuan and the distant month at 194.4 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 6.5 to 9.5 cents, with the nearby month at 62.35 yuan and the distant month at 60.03 yuan.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn Long-Short Positions Expand</h3>
<p>The volume of open interest in each month of marked yarn futures at the Chinese Merchant Yarn and Cloth Exchange as of March 9 was as follows: March, 39,450 bales; April, 57,550 bales; May, 65,300 bales; June, 52,400 bales; July, 46,900 bales; August, 17,900 bales. The total was 279,500 bales. After netting the long and short positions, the net open interest was 75,650 bales. There were 25 short sellers and 30 long buyers. The largest positions are summarized below (unit: bales).</p>
<p>Seller</p>
<p>Buyer</p>
<h3>Last Week's Rangoon Cotton Exports</h3>
<p>Telegram from Bombay on the 9th: Last week's cotton exports from Rangoon amounted to 431 tons, including 40 tons to Hamburg, 45 tons to Anhui, 78 tons to Liverpool, and 68 tons to Kobe.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Traders Active</h3>
<p>Prices Fell 10 Yuan Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>Recently, user trading has been quite active. The overseas silk market remains weak, with both raw silk buying and selling weak on the New York Stock Exchange. Therefore, there has been no turnaround in the Shanghai foreign silk market. Yesterday, only Dafeng and Yihe purchased good quality factory silk thin strips, and prices fell by 10 yuan compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Food: Near-Term Flour Slightly Weak, Distant Months High</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw near-term months stable and distant months rising after the opening bell. Foreign telegram quotations rebounded by about 10-20 cents. Market sentiment has shifted from concern over near-term to distant months. Although near-term inventories are not strong, they cannot continue to rise without actual sales demand. The factors driving the market for June and subsequent months include the sudden spring cold and rain, and unresolved European tensions. Therefore, outside buying interest is concentrated, and market gains have been greater in the distant months. At the opening of the afternoon session, the current month saw slight weakness due to long positions selling off. New flour for June and subsequent months continued to see strong buying interest, and rose by another one or two cents, for a total increase of four cents over the morning. Based on the current situation, there is a possibility of further increases in the distant months, which should gradually approach the prices in April.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Buying Interest Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was firm again after the morning opening bell, with foreign wheat prices rebounding by about 10-20 cents. Market sentiment is paying little attention to the current month, but the deterioration of the international situation has had a deep impact on the market for June and subsequent months. With sudden rain all day yesterday, buying interest remained strong, and prices for all months rose by two or three cents. At the opening of the afternoon session, trading in new wheat was very brisk, with many outside buyers and some insiders selling. With the forces of both sides similar, there was little upward movement, but in terms of the environment, there is still room for further firmness.</p>
<p>In addition, over 2,000 bags of spot wheat were traded, including Shandong and Jiangbei wheat, priced at 5.225 to 5.22 yuan, which was handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat reports indicate that a storm and locusts occurred in the southwest, which has slightly increased interest in various regions. However, it is too early to say whether crops have been damaged. The overseas market has improved slightly.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise by 30-40 Cents Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, more than 40 suppliers still arrived (with a total of over 8,000 piculs of goods). The market was still brisk in the morning, but the sales volume in this street seemed to decline in the afternoon market. Over 3,000 packages were still handled by Baozhou, Qingjin, Yantai and other suppliers. The market saw a premium of half a cent for thin rice, 10-20 cents for thick early japonica rice, and 10-20 cents for Duyang pointed rice, and Yuanhao rice rose by 10 cents.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday's continuous rain in the agricultural area made it rare for boats to arrive from various suppliers downstream, with only 17 or 18 arriving. Prices for all goods were quoted up by 20-40 cents. Although there was some trading in the market, it was not possible to sell all the goods.</p>
<h3>Client Xian and Foreign Rice Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday's client xian market continued to see arrivals from Jiujiang, Xianghan, and Zhejiang, but stockpiling by distributors had stalled. Interior and Northern clients were dealing only in foreign rice, and were reliant on enquiries from single clients on this street. Rising momentum immediately faltered. Although downstream river rice rose by 20-30 cents, client xian was digested less, and so the market turned flat. A total of 2,200 bags of Gan rice, 1,550 bags of Xianghan milled rice, and 140 bags of Wen Yong rice were traded and were all handled by local traders.</p>
<p>Foreign rice trading turned active yesterday, with inquiries from local merchants and Tianjin suppliers. However, there was still sufficient foreign rice stockpiled. Broken rice continued to be traded, and high-grade milled rice was also being marketed. Prices rose again. A total of 1,600 bags of Jia La Di, 1,200 bags of Jiaojiao, and 1,500 bags of Siamese rice Lu were traded. New deals included 500 tons of Siamese No. 3 broken rice, and there are rumours of ongoing negotiations for No. 3 and No. 4 broken rice and higher grade Mi Lu, and so a part of the market's sentiment turned soft again.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Falls Another Cent</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable with little change. The guild's opening prices were: No. 24 coarse white sugar spot at 22.3 yuan, transshipment at 7.1 yuan; Eastern Red (MS) mark at 15.8 yuan; No. 8 Eastern White spot at 21.9 yuan, transshipment at 6.9 yuan; No. 8 YRO mark spot at 21.65 yuan, transshipment at 6.6 yuan; Benmian white Zhenji No. 1 at 20.9 yuan, remainder the same as before. Only one business in the South market opened the Hainan Red at 12.4 yuan for just over 200 bags, falling another cent, although some were not reconciled, and remained for the time being.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the due date for the Sugar Industry Cooperation's exchange, and trading volume decreased. A total of 899 bags of Wuyang coarse white were traded at 22.1 yuan, 160 bags of medium sand white at 22.1 yuan, and 100 bags of No. 4 cotton white at 20.9 yuan, all unchanged.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Prices Loosen</h3>
<p>Longkou line vermicelli and dried noodles have recently loosened slightly in price, although customer demand remains active. Customer goods have opened at 24.5 yuan, and yesterday the market sold southern specifications (92 skins) at 14 yuan, and northern specifications quoted 24.5 yuan, loosening 40-50 cents from before, showing signs of temporary stability.</p>

<p>Publishing Industry</p>
<h3>Publishing Policy During National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Zhou Hanmei</p>
<p>A person with wisdom and vision is adept at dealing with and responding to the era and environment in which they find themselves. Furthermore, their approach is not for their own sake or for the sake of a small group to which they belong, but rather to systematically and purposefully advance the era and transform the environment, fully leveraging their efforts and making the highest possible contribution within the modern, specialized, and cooperative social system. In the past, we cannot deny that China's publishing industry was based solely on the perspective of "business." As a result, when literary books were popular, they were frantically published, but what literary theories or immortal masterpieces were actually developed during those frantic years? No one dares to say. Of course, the responsibility does not lie entirely with the publishing industry, but at least the publishing industry could have promoted this work. To this day, even a complete and perfect translation of a system of world literary masterpieces cannot be found, which truly leaves us with great regret! In the era when social science books were flourishing, many translations with incomprehensible wording and obscure meanings also appeared, and who does not feel deeply moved when recalling such incidents of misleading oneself and misleading readers! What is the ultimate outcome of "business eyes"? How much "business" can be done?</p>
<p>There is no need to talk about the past, and the future seems too distant, so let us focus on the present. Everyone knows that China is facing difficult times, and the crisis of 1936 is already unfolding before our eyes. For bookstores, the economic downturn and weak purchasing power mean that the publishing industry is truly facing an unprecedented hardship today. However, we must have a correct and clear understanding of this unprecedented hardship, and recognize that this is not unique to the publishing industry, but is true for all industries. Moreover, this hardship comes with the nation's entire national crisis and cannot be resolved by abandoning the major national issues and resolving one's own minor issues first. At this critical moment of national survival, every citizen can only exert their utmost efforts to defend the country, offering their wealth if they have it, and their strength if they have it. So what responsibilities should the publishing industry fulfill during this national crisis?</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the work of the publishing industry during the national crisis can either increase or diminish the entire nation's power to survive. This transition lies only in the difference of a single thought in the publishing policy. The author firmly believes that there are many intelligent and talented people in China's publishing industry, and perhaps some publishers with foresight are already making progress in their publishing plans, but perhaps some people engaged in the publishing industry are worried all day long and are still carefully considering. The author is not worthy, but would like to offer some humble opinions!</p>
<p>The detailed plan for the publishing policy during the national crisis still awaits further discussion in another article. Now, I will first put forward three principles for the consideration and guidance of contemporary sages in the country!</p>
<p>The first is to be for times of crisis, not for times of peace. When the country faces an unprecedented crisis, the nation's entire manpower and financial resources will have a decisive battle for the entire nation. Modern warfare is not just military, but a great battle of military, political, economic, and cultural forces. Therefore, how can we use our own strength very economically and effectively? This depends on prior training, and prior training is the most important thing. The most important part of the training is the issue of training materials, and the publishing industry should unreservedly undertake the responsibility of providing these training materials. So, what is meant by "for times of crisis, not for times of peace" refers to the provision of these training materials. According to this, not only should military knowledge and common wartime knowledge be published in large quantities, but also knowledge that analyzes the current situation, such as international politics and economics, as well as profound knowledge of the principles and applications of natural sciences and social sciences, should be fully supplied. The biggest prerequisite now is not to reorganize national history, preserve national essence, or promote national studies, but to preserve national life. All undertakings and all work should take this as a starting point and this as an ending. Therefore, the nature of the books published under the publishing policy during the national crisis should be adapted to the needs of times of crisis, rather than being both broad and far-reaching as in times of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Second, it is to be unified, not diverse. In the past, the Chinese publishing industry has always envied the air of academic freedom in Europe and the United States, believing that the books of any political party and the research of any kind of scholarship may be subject to considerable restrictions in politics and public persuasion, but there should be no obstacles in the field of academic research. Therefore, the demand for "freedom of publication" is as high as the demand for "open news." The issue of "open news" is not within our discussion, but "freedom of publication" is worthy of our research. To be honest, absolute freedom of publication cannot be found in any country on this earth. Whether it is a socialist country like the Soviet Union, a capitalist country like Britain, the United States, or France, or a fascist country like Italy and Germany, "publication restrictions" only have differences in degree, and there is no fact of absolute freedom. Why should the thinking of publications during the national crisis be more unified and not diverse? Because when a country is fighting for survival, the steps must be unified and the battle lines must be consolidated; and unified steps and consolidated formations are generated by consistency in thought and belief. Suppose the prior training materials are still diverse and still based on several absolutely different beliefs, then because of the difference in thought and belief, the steps will not be uniform, and the formation will be more difficult to consolidate. How can it be a reverie to try to fight for national survival with scattered and ununified meaning? Therefore, the second principle of the publishing policy during the national crisis is that the central belief of all publications must be unified and absolutely not diverse.</p>
<p>Third, it is to be for the masses, not for the aristocracy. The training materials during the national crisis are needed by every citizen and must be obtained by every literate citizen. Although the purchasing power of the Chinese people is weak, the masses will not be stingy with these final and must-buy publications. However, the Chinese masses are poor. If the pricing is expensive, it will inevitably hinder the circulation of these training materials. In the past, books with only 30,000 or 40,000 words were often typeset in size 4 font, printed on Daolin paper, and then elaborately bound with gold lettering, so the price was at least one dollar. It is certainly not bad for booksellers to give this kind of book to university professors or the sons of wealthy people who buy books but do not read them and put them on rosewood bookshelves as decorations, but it is only possible to sigh and look at the ocean for the masses of China to buy them. This point already had value in being brought up for research in times of peace, and it should be pointed out that this method is an intolerable mistake in the training materials of times of crisis. Therefore, the pricing of publications during the national crisis should be particularly low, enough to cover costs, and there should be no hope of making a fortune and escaping to Paris to become a Jew. Pricing should be for the masses and not for the aristocracy, which is the third important principle.</p>
<p>This is a serious issue facing the publishing industry. I firmly believe that Chinese publishers with vision will have better revisions and supplements to this issue!</p>
<h3>Introduction to "Military Common Sense for Youth"</h3>
<p>— Aying</p>
<p>Compiled and Translated by Wang Xilun, Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>In the otherwise dull and chaotic world of publishing, the Commercial Press's publication of "Military Common Sense for Youth" is certainly a noteworthy and unusually important book.</p>
<p>Everyone keenly feels the perilous state of the nation, and everyone eagerly desires to contribute their intellect, strength, and wealth to the country. But how can they realize this? How can they serve? I believe that, aside from armed comrades, whether they are outstanding or ordinary intellectuals, they all lament that their "hearts are willing, but their strength is insufficient." Not only that, they simply lack the ability to even save themselves, let alone anything else. If this is the case for a small number of intellectuals, there is no need to even mention the general illiterate public. This is such a dangerous and frightening thing.</p>
<p>National crisis has reached a stage where it cannot be resolved by petitions and marches. The general public has also reached a stage where they cannot be satisfied by propaganda and slogans. So, what kind of practical preparations are being made? We cannot even obtain a common publication on military common sense. How can we talk about anything else? Under these circumstances, we cannot help but pay great attention to "Military Common Sense for Youth," compiled and translated by Mr. Wang Xilun and published by the Commercial Press. After carefully reading it, it is even more necessary to solemnly introduce it to the readers.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three volumes. The first volume is "Army," the second volume is "Navy," and the third volume is "Military Aviation." The author will now introduce them separately as follows:</p>
<p>Army</p>
<p>In this booklet, it first explains the organization and functions of China's national defense agencies, such as the Military Affairs Commission, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Military Council. Then, it elaborates on the organization of our country's army, military service, national military education, and the ranks of soldiers. It also briefly describes the duties of infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers, transport troops, military police, and common sense during combat. Furthermore, it explains the new and old weapons of the army, such as rifles, machine guns, cannons, electric cannons, tanks, and poison gas, one by one. It also provides a comparative analysis of the methods of use and the advantages and disadvantages of each weapon. Finally, it provides statistics on the current status of the armies of various countries around the world, allowing readers to gain a comparative understanding.</p>
<p>Navy</p>
<p>The categorization method of this book is the same as that of the "Army" volume. It first describes the organization of our country's navy, such as the Ministry of the Navy and fleet formations. Then, it describes the types and tasks of naval vessels, such as battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and submarines, including their combat power, defensive capabilities, and construction. All these have concise explanations. Furthermore, it is the exposition of naval weapons. The use, effectiveness, and principles of battleships, hydro-weapons, optical weapons, electrical weapons, and chemical weapons are briefly described. Finally, there is the current situation and statistics of the navies of various countries around the world, allowing readers to obtain a comparative understanding.</p>
<p>Military Aviation</p>
<p>In modern warfare, the air force can determine the success or failure, victory or defeat of a war. It can not only exert its power to destroy enemy positions, but also disrupt the enemy's rear and destroy the enemy's rear. Therefore, future wars are truly three-dimensional wars. In this booklet, in addition to explaining the characteristics and types of military aircraft, the functions, equipment, combat capabilities, and combat methods of fighter planes, reconnaissance planes, bombers, transport planes, and training planes are briefly described. As for the methods of defense and attack against air raids, there are also detailed descriptions. Finally, there is a report and statistics on the current status of the air forces of various countries around the world, which readers will certainly gain a clear understanding of.</p>
<p>This "Military Common Sense for Youth" not only has simple and concise explanations in terms of text, but also publishes photographs that take up nearly half of the space. While referring to the text, readers can of course better understand the content of the army, navy, and air force, and acquire basic military knowledge. The content of this book is indeed quite complete and suitable for the general needs of the Chinese people. I recommend it to the general public. If the price could be a little lower, then I think it would greatly benefit the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The Publication of the Fifth Issue of the First Volume of Telecommunications Efficiency Telecommunications Efficiency is edited by the Telecommunications Special Publication Society. It is now heard that the fifth issue of the first volume has been published. Its main items include: Yin Guoyong's Research on Traffic in Urban Telephones, Huang Xiuqing's Procurement of Telephone Poles and Their Procedural Problems, Qian Qichen's Brief Report on the Survey of Telephone Businesses in Europe and America, Shu Fang's Revised National Phonetic Telegraph, and My Views on Long-Distance Telephone Rates. These are all famous works in the telecommunications industry. In addition, there are many other papers, as well as the latest regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Communications, major domestic and international telecommunications events, and special communications from Japan. There are many items, too many to list in detail. The content is more substantial than before. The address of the society is 769 Zhongshan North Road, Nanjing. The subscription price for the whole year is only 50 cents for paper materials. Anyone who wants to know the way to reform telecommunications in our country must read it.</p>

<h3>Treatment of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>To talk about the effective drugs for treating gonorrhea, it is first necessary to explain the various therapies for gonorrhea. Before talking about the various methods of treating gonorrhea, it is necessary to briefly explain what kind of disease gonorrhea is and its symptoms, etc., so that it can be clear which method is reasonable, which drugs are effective, and even which are unreasonable. First of all, gonorrhea is mostly acute anterior urethral gonorrhea. There are very few exceptions. The so-called anterior urethral gonorrhea refers to the fact that gonococci only invade and multiply in the anterior urethral part. Logically, local symptoms only require local treatment. Drugs to kill gonococci are readily available. Why is it necessary to perform other therapies? Why do Chinese and foreign doctors think it is a difficult disease to treat? Because gonococci are latent in the inner layer of the urethral mucosa, it is difficult to completely eliminate gonococci without damaging the mucosa. Under this narrow method, it feels difficult. But with proper implementation, it can be completely cured. There are various methods of treating gonorrhea, including electrotherapy, irrigation, injection, and oral medication. Electrotherapy uses diathermy, which is divided into long wave and short wave. Long wave must be applied close to the skin, which is not only troublesome, but also has many drawbacks and often burns the skin, with little effect. In recent times, short-wave diathermy is the most popular because it can be treated through clothing and has a quick and effective effect. As for the use of the light power of electrical machinery to kill bacteria, the most recent is the Turbidity Treatment Machine. The light power of this machine can penetrate the skin deeply without any damage. Irrigation, the distribution of the washing liquid for the condition, the concentration and time of use, are all related. Currently, the injection of gonorrhea serum is more widely used. The best of these preparations is "Gono-Serol." Injection drugs such as "Mixed Gonorrhea Vaccine" and pigment preparations such as "Antidy Snow Qing" and "Detolypa Flavine" are superior. Oral medications should be able to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and have strong bactericidal power, can penetrate the mucous membrane deeply, and must not contain strong astringent ingredients. The "Mesalin," which is currently used in various medical circles, is quite suitable and is an excellent preparation. Although the treatment of gonorrhea is as described above, diseases change in many ways and cannot be generalized. Moreover, the treatment of gonorrhea, even with a small difference, will leave endless harm, such as prolonged recovery period, turning into chronic, etc. These are all the results of wrong methods and improper medication.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea and Fertility</h3>
<p>— Liu Xuan</p>
<p>Female infertility can be divided into physiological natural defects and disease factors. Women who are infertile due to natural defects are extremely rare, so I will not describe them here. In addition, most infertility is caused by diseases. There are several types of diseases that are sufficient to affect fertility. Let me briefly describe gonorrhea. Women who suffer from gonorrhea and are unable to conceive are the most common and frequently seen. Statistics from medical experiments and investigations into the causes of female infertility show that six or seven out of ten are caused by gonorrhea. This shows the great relationship between gonorrhea and fertility.</p>
<p>When a man is infected with gonorrhea, the gonococci first invade the urethra. In women, the first invasion is the vaginal cavity and the uterus. When gonococci invade the vaginal cavity, they cause vaginitis. After invading the uterus, they will inevitably cause endometritis and parenchymal inflammation. All of these are sufficient to cause infertility. Gonorrhea can also change the position of the uterus, which is a major cause of infertility. In addition, if gonococci invade the fallopian tubes from the uterus, causing inflammation of the fallopian tubes, turning into an abscess, or even complete blockage of the fallopian tubes, it will become a cause of absolute infertility. Furthermore, it enters the ovaries, causing oophoritis. The maturation of the egg is hindered, and there is no ovulation, which is also a type of infertility. In addition, there is another major reason why women often become infertile after contracting gonorrhea because the sperm emitted by men pass through the vaginal cavity containing gonococci, and their activity is destroyed by the gonococci. Women are naturally unable to conceive. Therefore, if a woman suffers from gonorrhea and is not cured, it will inevitably hinder fertility and cut off offspring. The relationship is extremely important.</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea in women is also best as early as possible, and it is best when it has not penetrated deep into the uterus. When not seeking medical attention and performing family treatment, "Gono-Serol" can be used externally and "Mesalin" can be taken internally, which may be effective.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Treatment of Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>In today's society, "neurasthenia" has become an extremely common symptom. It seems that many people suffer from this disease, and they are all young people. The causes of this disease, apart from a few special ones, are mostly the result of debauchery, the so-called abnormal sexual life, such as excessive sexual activity and masturbation, etc. The so-called neurasthenia is a state of stimulant weakness in the nervous system. Its general symptoms are that the nervous system is extremely easy to excite and also extremely easy to fatigue. At the same time, disorders of the reproductive organs or reproductive diseases can occur. This is because improper sexual life consumes too much, and the body lacks phosphorus and endocrine fluid, resulting in insufficient nutrition for the tissues of the whole body, causing neurasthenia. This disease can be divided into three stages: (1) Localized neurasthenia, (2) Lumbar spinal nerve syndrome, which is pain in the lumbar region. (3) Cerebral neurasthenia, which has reached the stage of whole-body neurasthenia. Although the symptoms of neurasthenia in these three stages are different, a study of their source shows that they are all due to excessive deficiency of endocrine and phosphorus in the human body, which affects all parts of the body, resulting in malnutrition and various symptoms of neurasthenia. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for neurasthenia is to supplement the body with phosphorus and endocrine fluid. Currently, the most popular drug for this is "Arolsen." At the same time, it is also very important to follow the doctor's instructions for proper health care.</p>
<h3>Symptoms and Treatment of Eczema</h3>
<p>— Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>The parts of the body where this disease is prone to occur are mostly in the joint areas, such as the inner thighs, the area around the scrotum, and the inner upper arms. It has been heard that some are scattered on the limbs.</p>
<p>When this disease occurs, the skin usually first feels itchy, hot, and swollen. Then, papules the size of pinheads appear and gradually turn into blisters. There are exceptions, or they rupture, or form soft scabs, which are stubborn and difficult to treat.</p>
<p>The causes of this disease are mostly unclean skin, infection with parasites, adenopathic cachexia, and circulatory disorders. Other causes include chemical, thermal, and mechanical irritation. Coolies are most prone to suffering from this disease, and there are also cases due to anemia, chlorosis, and diabetes, but these are rare.</p>
<p>The treatment of this disease mostly focuses on local treatment, and attention must also be paid to the overall condition. The most taboo local treatment is the use of alcoholic liquids, as they irritate the epidermis and peel it off, which is not only ineffective but harmful. At this time, it is best to use ointments or oils. Today, the most popular among doctors is the good skin disease medicine "Misulzine." This medicine is fully equipped with drugs to eliminate skin bacteria and promote skin resistance. Various ringworm infections are effective when used. It is not known that it can also quickly work for eczema.</p>
<h3>Stomachache</h3>
<p>— Jiang Guofan</p>
<p>The causes of this disease are mostly acute gastric catarrh, chronic gastric catarrh, hyperacidity, stomach fluid leakage, and drastic emotional disturbances. The internal medicine treatment for these symptoms is only reliant on alkali agents. Alkali agents can neutralize stomach acid, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, stop vomiting, and regulate stomach function, causing it to perform normal movements. This type of preparation will not cause any harm even if taken for a long time. It is not like painkillers containing anesthetic ingredients, which may hinder or affect the body. Among this type of preparation, the most popular one is "Wei Bao." This medicine is a sophisticatedly formulated preparation of alkali agents. All stomach ailments such as heart vomiting, stomach pain, and stomach bloating will respond with miraculous effects when taken. I have repeatedly used it in clinical practice and write about the experiments to inform those who are suffering from this disease.</p>

<p>(Mr. Hu Wenzhang asked) My wife has been suffering from leukorrhea for many years, and it is even worse now. I want to get treatment, but I regret not knowing a good doctor. Please recommend a doctor with experience in treating women's uterine diseases.</p>
<p>Answer: Dr. Liu Xuan, a female doctor at Chunzai Hospital, 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, specializes in the treatment of women's uterine diseases. You can go there for inquiries.</p>
<p>Previously Suffered from Stomachache</p>
<p>(Mr. Lu Jiannan asked) I previously suffered from stomachache. According to the instructions in your journal, I took "Wei Bao" sold by Renshou Pharmacy and recovered. However, I am deeply afraid of recurrence. I do not know if the medicine can be taken regularly.</p>
<p>Answer: "Wei Bao" does not contain any anesthetic ingredients. It can be taken for a long time without any harm. It can also be taken for indigestion because it can regulate stomach movement.</p>
<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Jinan City Holds Games for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>Reading a newspaper report from Jinan: "In order to improve the health of disaster victims, Jinan City plans to hold disaster victims' games in the warm spring. It has now been decided to hold them at the Sports Ground outside Nanweimen on March 7. The entire event is divided into adult, children's, and women's groups. All sports events are closely related to actual rural activities. Like individual competitions, adults have 400-meter weight-bearing walking races, pole-carrying races, wheelbarrow races, 600-meter carrying races, sandbag throwing, digging competitions, etc. Group competitions include 400-meter two-person carrying races, 800-meter carrying eight-person relays, etc. Women's individual competitions include 100-meter rolling ball races, needle-threading races, bag-sewing races, basket-carrying races...etc. The top six individuals and the top four groups will be awarded cash prizes...etc."</p>
<p>Here, there are several points about the holding of the disaster victims' games in Jinan City that are worth our attention:</p>
<p>1. As everyone knows, today, Heaven has actually sent the "God of Disaster" to be a good friend to our China. Floods, droughts, insect plagues...etc. have formed an "indissoluble bond" with our peasant masses. In this way, with the disaster victims gnawing on tree bark, swallowing "Goddess of Mercy" to starve to death or swell to death, some disaster victims finally, with the disaster relief and relief from the government authorities and the "great philanthropists" in society, can barely keep their remaining lives going. It is especially true that every winter, the shelters, cold shelters, porridge distribution plants, etc. held by "philanthropists" everywhere are the "happy and comfortable nests" of disaster victims!</p>
<p>However, even if our young masters and young ladies cover their noble noses there, they are unwilling to step into the shelters and cold shelters. How much attention has been paid to the hygiene of the facilities and the health of the disaster victims? However, this is precisely what tens of thousands of ragged, filthy disaster victims regard as their only "comfortable nest," filling it and living in it, even though the disease demon is always befriending and accompanying them!</p>
<p>Therefore, today, the fact that the authorities in Jinan City can consider the disaster victims and hold "disaster victims' games in order to improve the health of the disaster victims" can be called an "unprecedented initiative" (which may not even exist in other countries?).</p>
<p>2. In our social organization with a private property system, "profit," "power," and "fame" are originally the "purposes" for which ordinary people live. How can sports be an exception? In schools, gyms, and sports fields, we have "gloriously" created several what-kings," what-"experts," outside of this, few can take care of the true meaning of sports. As for taking sports and combining it with our real life and connecting it with it, that has never happened before, right?</p>
<p>However, today, the fact that the authorities in Jinan City can use various disaster victim sports programs to "closely match actual rural activities" is indeed the second thing that is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>However, to put it another way, shelters cannot ultimately be the "place of eternal life" for disaster victims, right? However, in today's era of widespread famine and the collapse of the entire rural economy, where is there a "place for the peasant masses to use their abilities"? Where can the disaster victims find a way out? I don't know if the authorities in Jinan City have paid attention to this?</p>
<h3>Song of Spring</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>"Spring everywhere is immersed in a circle of dullness, but oh! I need strong alcohol, alcohol can make me spew out a spicy heat, I need rampant torrents to wash away the dullness that is everywhere."</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, I sang this melancholy song every day. This song made me burst into sour and bitter juice. This song made me forget my surroundings. Ah! The surroundings are full of demons! With cunning faces and fierce eyes, they all mock me, giving me endless suffering.</p>
<p>I love freedom, oh! At that time, I opened my wings and flew, quietly flying towards the sky. I looked for the heat, I looked for the beautiful blue sky, but oh, from the southern corner of the sky to the cold northern sea, from the coast of the vast East Sea to the steep mountains of the west! Whether in the bright morning light or in the silent night, ah! The long journey that once made me forget my suffering! Where has there ever been a beautiful spring?</p>
<p>"The beautiful spring has been devoured by demons!"</p>
<p>Disappointed, pressing down on the dull mood, cursing, in the bright sunshine that resembles the vermilion face of a virgin, in the silent and bleak dusk, I wandered alone, sighing, but oh, I dare not curse the god of spring, but I want to curse the sinister demons!</p>
<p>"Demons have occupied this world! Demons have devoured the spring of the human world!"</p>
<p>The long journey! Made me deeply taste that poisonous juice! I love the gorgeous spring, I pursue the light, but the demons are laughing at me, despising me:</p>
<p>"Do you want a mirror? A weak person like you also yearns for a beautiful spring?"</p>
<p>Yes! They are also holding a gun, aiming at my chest. When I roar angrily, watching, I wave my hand, watching, I desperately walk towards the dark corner, they tremble frantically, they will threaten me:</p>
<p>"Do you want spring? Look at where this gun is aimed!"</p>
<p>Ah! Those many demons, those many shameless demons are mocking me!</p>
<p>Am I forever surrendering to the demons who have occupied spring?</p>
<p>So, I roared angrily, but ah! I realized my surroundings, and beyond the surroundings, there are many who sympathize with me! They also have no beautiful spring, they are also oppressed in a circle of misfortune, they are immersed in the alcohol of dullness!</p>
<p>"Let's stand together! People without spring, oh! Come oh! Hurry oh!"</p>
<p>I shouted violently, I drank strong wine, I burst into strong heat, my eyes burst into red brilliance, my whole body was racing to burn, I was trembling, when the demons still occupied our spring, my soul was no longer alone, no longer quietly and dully looking for a beautiful spring.</p>
<p>"Spring everywhere is immersed in the poisonous juice of demons! But oh! We want a great torrent! To wash away the dullness and welcome the beautiful spring!"</p>
<p>The song of wandering for two or three years, now oh, no longer needs to be sung, I want oh this song of countless people! A truly free song! Ah! The song of finding a beautiful spring makes me forget the melancholy of the past!</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— (Blowing)</p>
<p>Reuters telegram on the 7th, Germany announced today that it would not recognize the establishment of the Rhineland as a demilitarized zone under the Locarno Public Law, and immediately sent troops into the Rhineland, a move that shocked the whole of Europe. Tan Lao San said that the Italian-Abyssinian war is about to come to an end, and Germany has announced the abolition of the Locarno Pact, and re-occupied the Rhineland region. One scene after another in Europe, the performance comes out, there is a "green dragon head on the face kill, mountain rain is coming, wind full of buildings," of the sense.</p>
<p>After Hirota was given the mandate to form a cabinet, he was dissatisfied with the military, and almost gave birth. After the result of the talks with Terauchi, the new cabinet is expected to be established. Tan Lao San said that Hirota has never agreed with the scorched earth policy, and from now on, he has to abandon the peaceful policy and embark on the road of the scorched earth policy.</p>
<h3>Long Gown</h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>"Little Mao's dad, Little Mao's dad, wake up. Heavens, are you really not going to get better? Heh heh heh..." Aunt Fushun’s face was blurred with tears, she cried and shouted, her eyes fixed on the patient's eyes, her mouth right up to the patient's mouth.</p>
<p>"Dad, Dad, heh heh heh..." Little Mao stamped his feet like mad beside his mother, tears streaming down like a tide.</p>
<p>Male and female neighbors filled the windows and doorway, whispering and sighing. Everyone put on a sad face, as if saying, "Never had enough to eat, never had enough warm clothes, suffered a lifetime!"</p>
<p>Fushun, who was on the brink of death and in a hazy state of mind, slightly opened his eyes due to the heart-wrenching cries of his wife and children. A faint glimmer of life full of warmth, like the dim flame of an oil lamp about to go out, weakly shone on their tear-stained faces. His lips moved slightly, and a thick, phlegm-filled sound came from his throat.</p>
<p>"Little Mao, don't cry. Listen to what Dad is saying."</p>
<p>The mother and son tried their best to hold back their tears and suppress their sobs, putting their right ears together to the patient's lips, listening intently. The room was as silent as a tomb.</p>
<p>"Long... gown,"</p>
<p>Little Mao broke the silence:</p>
<p>"It sounds like he's saying long gown, Mom."</p>
<p>Aunt Fushun felt as if a sharp knife had suddenly pierced her heart, her whole body trembled with pain, and the tears she had barely held back just now flooded out like a river bursting its banks. Little Mao stamped his feet like mad again. The neighbors continued to whisper and sigh, some even wiping their wet eyes with their sleeves.</p>
<p>"Poor brother... heh heh heh..."</p>
<p>Aunt Fushun's heart was broken. The long gown, in her husband's eyes, was as precious as the piece of land he always refused to sell! He wore this long gown when he and she kowtowed on the red felt blanket more than ten years ago. For more than ten years, he wore this long gown when visiting relatives, celebrating the New Year and festivals, and praying to the gods. During his illness, he never forgot it and always mentioned it to her. Even in his hazy dying moments, he was reluctant to part with this long gown. She remembered one New Year when her husband returned from visiting relatives ten miles away in the drizzle, his long gown was gone, leaving only a coarse cloth short robe full of patches. He carried the "return gift" basket in one hand and tightly pressed his chest with the other, as if he were having a heart attack. "Where's the long gown?" she asked in surprise. "It started raining halfway, so I took it off and hid it here," he said, pointing to his chest, and then reached under the hem of the coarse cloth short robe and took out the carefully folded long gown. "What's the matter with a drizzle? You're really—" "It's not easy to keep a long gown. What do women know!"</p>
<p>"Poor brother, heh heh heh..."</p>
<p>Pain and sorrow, like an electric current, immediately spread from Aunt Fushun's cries to the depths of the neighbors' hearts, and tears fell from their eyes like raindrops. From Aunt Fushun's mouth, they learned that this treasured long gown had been in the pawnshop for several months, and they also knew that Fushun always forgot about this long gown. "If the long gown isn't redeemed for me to wear, I won't close my eyes when I die." Fushun often said this these past few days, Aunt Fushun told them. From this long gown, they thought of Fushun's family's life, and from their life, they thought of their own lives, and from their ending, they deduced their own ending. They unconsciously rushed to Fushun's bed.</p>
<p>"Aunt Fushun, is he still thinking about that long gown at this moment?"</p>
<p>"Alas, what can poor people say!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Aunt Fushun seemed not to have heard their words,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>She was desperately crying and shouting, unforgettable past events were biting at her broken heart like poisonous snakes.</p>
<p>One night several months ago, Afu, the opium henchman of the village chief, suddenly knocked on their door with a flurry, as if something extremely urgent had happened.</p>
<p>"Fushun, the village chief wants you to give him two liang of stuff, the money will be given to you in a few days."</p>
<p>"It's all gone long ago. I sold everything to buy grain and eat it. There were only five or six liang of things in total."</p>
<p>"Trying to raise the price, huh? People are saying you still have some."</p>
<p>"What a joke. Would a poor person still want to raise the price? Let me show you." He quickly took out a jar that had contained opium paste from the corner of the cupboard.</p>
<p>The next day, in the morning, Fushun slowly returned home from the village chief's bed, his brow tightly furrowed, as if some great disaster was about to befall him.</p>
<p>"Little Mao's mother, a difficult situation. The village chief has given me three days to pay two dollars for opium tax, or he'll send the police."</p>
<p>After breakfast, Fushun walked to a town with a pawnshop twenty miles away, carrying a package on his back. In this package: a summer cloth mosquito net, a pair of summer cloth pockets, several sets of summer cloth shirts, several catties of ramie thread, and Fushun's treasured long gown.</p>
<p>"Heavens, poor people can't even wear a long gown! Heh heh heh..."</p>
<p>"Dad, Dad, heh heh heh..."</p>
<p>Fushun's eyes opened slightly again, but his lips no longer moved, and no sound came from his throat, but the glimmer of life that shone from the small slits of his eyes was even weaker than before, still telling people: "If the long gown isn't redeemed for me to wear, I won't close my eyes when I die."</p>
<h3>Dinner Party</h3>
<p>— Ji Nan</p>
<p>Northerners eat pancakes, southerners eat white rice, and foreigners eat bread. Although there are various foods and different ways of eating them, people with heads on their shoulders all have a mouth to eat, which is the same in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. However, the use of "eating" seems to have other more important functions besides satisfying appetite. What is this function? If you can pay attention to the particularly prosperous business of restaurants in the city, you will surely realize it.</p>
<p>This has become a habit. If you want to invite a few friends or colleagues to discuss something, you must first have a "drunken and heated discussion." Even if this matter is official business and not a personal request, it seems that you always have to treat someone to a meal before it is easier to talk. Even things like holding a board meeting or welcoming celebrities to raise money for disaster relief are held in restaurants. As for asking for favors from big shots, you should definitely treat them to a meal. Because the adults and gentlemen are very busy, in Nanjing today and Shanghai tomorrow, it is not easy to find them. Only by sending an invitation to dinner, or when it is time to eat, will they be embarrassed to make a phone call to say "thank you," but take the time to sit for three or five minutes. Therefore, the opportunity cannot be missed, and you quickly pull him aside and speak in his ear. Although saying so inevitably turns into deaf ears, and there is no news for a year or two, at least it has been said. And when talking to friends, "Today I treated a certain elder to dinner, a certain elder was like this and that..." at least there is some glory.</p>
<p>And the "Qionglin Banquet" in schools before winter and summer vacations is truly the most "magnificent and grand." Originally, graduating students are not like apprentices who have completed their training, so there is no need to invite anyone to drink. Even if you want to invite someone, it is enough for the students to invite the teachers once, and the teachers to invite the students once. But that's not the case. It starts with all the graduating students and all the faculty members, then all the faculty members invite all the graduating students back; then the graduating students of each department invite the faculty members of each department, then the faculty members of each department invite the graduating students of each department back; then so-and-so and other top students invite so-and-so and other respected teachers, then so-and-so and other respected teachers invite so-and-so and other top students back. In addition, there are all kinds of tricks, causing "every meal is a feast," which is very annoying.</p>

Just say that the day shooting the night street, the detective (Zhang Zhidao) was searching for the fugitive A Long (Jin Yan), when it first discovered the old Jin hidden in the dark, it barked wildly, and the old Jin was immediately scared to escape, and the old Zhang quickly let the dog go, and it chased after him. When the old Jin jumped over a dilapidated wall several feet high, the dog also bravely chased after him. Such a scene is rare in domestic films. So when this shot was finished,</p>

<p>The staff at the scene applauded and praised him, and even old Wu liked to kiss him.</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun Sleepless All Night</h3>
<p>— Yulin</p>
<p>A western-style bedroom, the scenery in the room is extremely rich and luxurious, in the middle there is a large copper bed, glittering with gold, shining brightly, at first glance, you know it is newly purchased, and at the same time, it also makes people suspect who's daughter-in-law's bridal chamber it is.</p>
<p>Before long, Wang Guilin and Yuan Meiyun arrived. Wang said to Yuan, "Good grandson, this is the bedroom that your grandfather specially set up for you, and you can sleep with your grandfather from now on." Yuan was speechless when he heard this, and seemed to have endless thoughts. Wang still pointed to the surrounding setting and showed it, pleased and content, and the happiness in his heart was the opposite of Yuan's.</p>
<p>Wang took off his clothes and went to sleep first, and seeing that Yuan was still standing there, he urged him and said, "Come to sleep quickly, grandfather will take you to the countryside to meet a few uncles and aunts early tomorrow morning! They are so happy to hear that you are coming back from Nanyang?"</p>
<p>Yuan hesitated, but finally took off his clothes and went to bed, but his uneasy state was like a lamb in a hungry tiger's den. Wang saw his grandson for the first time, and was full of love, and wanted to hug him in his arms, but Yuan could not accept his grandfather's kindness because he had a secret, and the bitterness in his heart was beyond words, so Yuan could not sleep all night, and because of this, a scene that was neither crying nor laughing evolved.</p>
<p>This is a segment of "Incarnation Girl," a full-length sound film produced by Yihua Company. Yuan Meiyun's performance as a grandson in disguise as a man is excellent, especially in this scene, she uses her inner performance, expressions and movements, all reaching the point of perfection. As for Wang Guilin, who plays the grandfather, also has excellent acting skills. In short, this scene contains infinite stimulation and mystery, and the director's superior skills can hold on to the hearts of every audience, and as the plot unfolds, the blood is boiling like fire, and the emotions are surging like waves.</p>
<h3>"A Tale of Two Cities" Female Lead Elizabeth Allan</h3>
<h3>Vinegar Tide in National Beauty</h3>
<p>The "National Beauty" sound film will be released at the Carlton soon. Those who have seen the preview unanimously call it the only successful work in domestic song and dance sound films. And Director Dan Duyu's skills are also exhausted in this film. The most intriguing thing is that in the singing and dancing, and the colorful flowers, the male and female protagonists have a vinegar tide in the dressing room, making the crying sound fill the room, driving the male protagonist out. In a moment, the sadness and joy are different. It is not easy to achieve this unless the actors have considerable cultivation on weekdays.</p>
<h3>Miss Does Not Know Summer</h3>
<p>"Go to Nature"—Miss Meihua, the daughter of a general (played by Xu Jian), wears a golden embroidered and dazzling long dress, lowers her pink neck, hangs her jade rings, and loosens a few strands of green hair in front of her forehead, leaning on a deep green velvet long sofa, trying on her ivory high heels.</p>
<p>The maid smiled and brought in a bunch of white lotus flowers.</p>
<p>"Miss, look at these flowers!"</p>
<p>"Has summer come again?"</p>
<p>"It's already May."</p>
<p>As she spoke, the maid put the white lotus flowers in a vase.</p>
<p>From here, you can appreciate the life of this young lady. If she doesn't see the white lotus flowers, it seems that she doesn't know that it is summer.</p>
<h3>Paul Muni's New Masterpiece "The Story of Louis Pasteur" Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Paul Muni's new work, "The Story of Louis Pasteur," is one of the best works recently produced by Warner Bros., telling the story of the world-renowned French doctor Pasteur's struggle. Paul Muni is a maverick in the film industry, and his amazing makeup skills are unmatched by any male star. As long as friends who have seen "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," "Fury," and "Scarface" can probably believe that this is very true. Now, in this "The Story of Louis Pasteur," he plays the great doctor Pasteur, vividly showing Pasteur's spirit of courage, determination, and sacrifice on the screen, making the audience forget that they are watching a movie there. This is indeed very difficult to achieve, and it is feared that no one but Paul Muni can play this kind of role. The film has arrived in Shanghai and will be released in the Grand Theater soon. It is expected that after the release of this film, it will be as sensational as "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang."</p>
