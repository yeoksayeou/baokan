<p>南京蔣委員長發表新生活運動二週年紀念之感想、原文如下、今天是新生活運動創始以來第二週紀念日、關於今後的工作綱領、和所應注重的中心工作、總會方面、另有書面發表、不待重述、這一個運動、已經有了二年的時間、從今天起、便是第三年度的開始、我們知道這個運動的成敗、不僅為世界對我們國家觀瞻所繫、簡直是我們民族的前途存亡所關、在二週年紀念的今天、我們最緊要的一件事、就要對於過去的成績、加一番坦白忠實的檢査、以作今後努力的參考、我敢坦白說一句、新生活運動、自創始以來、雖然推行的區域一天一天的加廣、工作的項目和範圍、一天一天的加多、推行團體和人員、也隨時都有增加、照今年的統計、各省市及鐵路均有勞動服務團的組織、團員人數、總計在十萬人以上、對　人民訓練民衆敎育、救災衛生等等工作、團員大都能熱烈參加、表現相當成績、可是就一般的成效和實際情形來說、實不能滿足我們的期望、達到原來的目的、不但如此、簡直可以說、有退無進、在二週年紀念的時候、和前一年舉行週年紀念的時候、比較起來、還不及推行第一年時來得有成績、這是很可痛心、很可慚的、怎麽樣補救這一個缺點、眞是大家應該痛切反省的一個問題、我在去年一年間、周行的地方亦不少、所到之處、都留心觀察我們新生活運動的實際工作怎麽樣、一般社會的情形和國民生活、較未推行新運以前、有沒有進步、我敢說了極少數的地方以外、一般對於淸潔整齊的兩件事、尙且沒有做到、允其在都會之中、不論街上路上、到處都看得見惡濁凌亂的現象、特別在公共塲所或交通要點、如碼頭車站之類、一般上下往來的人、看不出曾經受過秩序訓練的樣子、而負有指導責任者、如憲兵警察保甲長之類、也不能積極的盡到我責、甚至於熟視無睹、反不如農村鄉間、還有幾個地方比較整潔能够實行這個運動、至於公務機關、照理應該爲一般社會與民衆的表率、公務員又是比較有知識者、應負領導責任的、但是照我觀察所得、能切實做到新生活運勁的要求、能够有秩序且有精神而無媿爲現代生活的標準者、實在是很少很少、我們現在到處都可看到新運的標語、而很少看到新運的實效、到處都可看到推行新運的團體或機關、却是很少看得見有多數國民確實受了新生活運動的效果、至於一般社會、能在食衣住行中表現禮義廉恥的四維、其生活方式能達到軍事化生產化藝術化、而且勵行勞動服務、具備互助合作的品德、愛國家愛民族的現代精神、那當然是更少了、我國人民衆多、社會情狀太複雜、舊有的習染也太覺根深蒂固、要想在短時間內使全體國民生產大改厥觀、當然不是一件容易的事、我們新生活運動推行的當初、所以定爲由淺入深、由易及難、推己及人、要從極平凡處下手、也就是這個意思、我上面批評的話、並不是苛求責備、更不是一筆抹殺我們已有的成績、和推助新運者的辛勞、但是新生活運動是一種敎化風動的運動、論理在開始的時候、比較不容易見效、而已經推行以後、應該是可以繼續進步、一年快似一年、乃事實上並不盡然、這中間若不是第一期的基礎不確實、就是第二期的努力有欠缺、若不是推行幹部和負有領導責任者沒有盡到職責、就是受指導的一般國民還沒有深切了解新運意義的重要、我希望我們負責推進新運的同志、和一般同胞、大家下一番深切的反省、過去我們國民習性上、有兩種最大缺點、是一般事業沒有進步的主因、第一是缺乏眞誠、第二是缺乏熱烈、因爲不是發於眞誠所以開始的時候也很緊張、稍久就不免流於弛怠、凡事祗求對付過去、不求實際效果、譬如各地推行新運、往往遇到有人將要考察的時候、臨時特別緊張一下、過去隨卽鬆懈下來、無人過問、又或在容易覺察的地方、則注意整潔、略爲偏僻一些的所在、就不去認眞實行、像這一種一暴十寒的做法、祗做表面的行爲、一般人民自然也相應以僞、不來眞切聽受指導了、至於第二點、我們如果缺乏熱烈的情緒、對於任何事情、便覺得不起勁、雖然不是有意懈怠、但終鼓不起奮迅向前的氣慨、結果便不免近於虛應故事、不但進行不能迅速、而且已有的成績、也往往不能保持、過去新運工作中、也難免有這種因循的流弊、在推行的人員、因之流於被動、旣不能以身作則、也不能熱心研究適合各種環境的推動方法、在一般國民、也因爲缺乏熱烈的感應、不能養成普遍自然而且持久的風氣、其實這種因循虛偽的痼習、就是不知禮義廉恥的惡果、也便是我們國家民族散亡的主因所在、我們耍成爲適於現代生存的國民、非澈底痛改這個痼習不可、總之、新生活運動、不是世界上普通一般的改良社會運動、而是一種救亡圖存的迫切的運動、在普通改良式的社會運動、其主旨在精益求精、是已經好了、還要求其更好的意思、所以不妨逐漸求進、其進程雖緩慢一些也不妨、至於我們所倡導的新生活運動、乃是昨死今生的運動、亦卽一種起死回生的運動、是因爲國民的精神道德和生活態度、實在太不適合於現代、而整個民族的生存、已經發生了嚴重的危險、因此要想從根本上改造國民的生活、以求民族之復興、所以各地同胞、萬不可視新生活運動僅爲少數倡導者事務、而應認爲與自身切己利害相關的事情、至於公務人員及警察憲兵與敎育界等、負有領導責任者、以及新運推行幹部、允其應該鼓起熱誠負起責任、時時要照着禮義廉恥的標準、和旣定的工作綱領、承續不斷的實實在在的努力、敢信新運工作、必能達到復興民族的使命、最後還要望我全國同胞、不要忘了實行新生活運動四句的提要、禮是規規矩矩的態度、義是正正當當的行爲、廉是淸淸白白的辨別、恥是切切實實的覺悟、（十八日中央社電）</p>

<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>八、甘肅菸草的製造程序</p>
<p>菸草是甘肅出產的大宗，類分棉菸，條菸（卽綠菸），黃菸，麻條四種。菸草種類雖然大別有四，製造方法郤是大致相同，不過在採用原料時各取其適合某種的菸色，配製某種顏料，增加了美觀罷了。這其間採擇原料和配製手續，就得經一番麻煩，正如本篇的程序：</p>
<p>第一步，除骨（俗呌撕菸），將菸葉的枝柄和葉筋，純用人工的完全抽去，只存留了葉片，這種工作大多數雇用婦女童工，看所抽下葉莖的多寡，給發工資，每斤的給銅元三四枚。</p>
<p>第二步—選葉（俗呌溜葉子）挑剔葉面斑剝和萎黃的部分，分出優劣的選別等第，葉要色綠而質厚的爲上品，不十分純選的决等，色澤黝暗而霉爛的，最爲下等。選擇的時候，倘逢天氣淸爽，菸葉乾燥，那麽，就得酌噴一些經沸的水，待葉片柔軟了，纔去翻動，那可不致破碎的太多。</p>
<p>第三步—配味同一品種的菸草，因十壞氣候人工肥料種種關係，味道就有較甜較辣較淡的分出來，如淡水菸，味淸而香；鹹水菸味平而淡；熟地菸甜淡適口；塞地菸濃辣刺喉。採運時就要各爲分置，以便臨時搭配。（味辣配味甜，味淡配味濃。）各坊間配搭不同，所以製出菸絲，因之亦分優劣。這種功夫又全在匠工經騐的深淺，造就好壞不同的成績了。</p>
<p>第四步—配製顏色　除麻條係本色，不需這種手續，外如綠菸每捆菸葉四百五十斤，大致用石膏末二斗，紫花一斤十四兩，槐花七斤，白礬面一斤，石鹻面一斤半。棉菸和黃菸，减去紫花槐花，却加上白鹽三十斤，姜黃三斤半，石紅三斤。將上列顏料先製成末，做調色的用途。</p>
<p>湯末法—取大鑊一口，內注淸水，先將槐花傾入，然後用火燒沸。旁邊放置一個大甕，這甕耍能容放　內全量的注水，尙不滿的。候鑊內水三四沸時，用小木桶或大瓢將槐花水向甕中徐徐傾下，同時取紫花放到甕裏隨傾隨放，一面用木棒極力攬拌，紫花全然放下。依决再落礬面石鹻，繼續攪拌。這時水沫沸騰，開水溢出甕面，就把預先製成的生石膏末盛着木框裏，汲甕中的水，乘熱傾入，隨傾隨攪，石未就變了綠色的沾泥狀。這其間顏色的鮮麗與吾，完全看配合的是吾適宜了。那沾泥狀的綠末，把來揑成團塊，放到屋頂或曠塲在太陽光裏蒸曬，半乾時卽用特製的仰面水扳去揉碎。通通曬乾了後，碾成細末，碾時加少許麻油，使色澤光鮮而且不易飛揚。碾過了再用細竹篩來慢慢地擺篩，那就成功了極細的粉末，儲備第五步的應用了。</p>
<p>第五步—合色　取前配好的菸葉，首先噴以開水，使得柔軟。决取滾煎的麻油，用嘖霧器去噴，每撒菸葉一層，就噴油一次，篩到末一層，篩完，用木權抖拌平勻，預備壓榨。</p>
<p>第六步—壓榨　置已經調色的菸葉在長方形的木恇裏，木框的長度丈許寬三尺四五寸。放好踏平，上覆木板，用特製的器械重力壓榨，的經四五小時。榨後截作三段疊置起來，下鋪木枋八條，長二尺三寸寬三寸三分，上面亦覆着同樣的木枋，用麻繩緊束，紮成一整實的菸捆。</p>
<p>第七步—刨絲（俗呌推菸）　將前壓成的捆束起，每捆用匠工二人，一人執刮，一人在前方拉着，刨下的絲條，由執刮的收入特製的小木　裏。　上裝着活板和斧形的木楔二具，菸絲放入時就由拉的人壓下，活板將木楔打緊，削齊兩端放在旁邊，第二决刨落的絲條，收入第二　裏，至第三决刨落時，可開去第一　取出製成的菸塊菸把，再將菸絲照前法裝入，這樣循環更迭的抽換着。那製成了的小方塊，名呌菸把，每把有二兩四兩的和半斤的數種。</p>
<p>第八步—晾菸　新製成的菸塊裏邊，還含着少量的水分，倘使層層疊置，難免發生霉敗，所以必定別闢明爽的晾室在宏闊的樓房裏，裝架板來做晾菸的應用。菸塊製好時就按着品字形式疊置架板上，等候乾透了，然後收集出售，輸售外省的裝上箱子運銷去了。</p>
<p>據調査所知，甘肅菸業的銷塲，遠及津·京·滬·漢等處；就近陝·豫·魯·晋等省，不消說自是有甘菸的輸售，皮絲菸是福建的名產，就不如甘菸銷塲的廣遠，但據甘省烟業中人說：「在民國十五年前烟價高漲時，每斤售銀四錢二三分或至四錢七八分（合洋六七角）可是，自十五年以後，價値逐漸跌落，一天不如一天，近二三年內，葉子每斤僅售銀一錢幾分（兩角上下）了，」究其竟，只是近年烟商全國减省工料，以至製造不良，或竟然攙入僞質，因此銷量頓時跋少，謀利轉獲損害的結果，這可算活該。其决，國內紙烟盛行，裝璜製作，甘烟自是望塵弗及的，這也是甘肅烟業不振的另一原因，那麼，想圖挽救，就非培植優良烟葉和探討精美製法不可了。</p>

<p>中央社云、國營招商局新江天輪、昨晨由甬來滬、駛抵吳淞口外鴨窩沙附近、突將油船一艘撞沉、全船老幼男女、均吿失蹤、該輪因撈救無效、卽駛滬向局報吿經過、茲據記者探得各情如下、</p>
<p>新江天輪　經鴨窩沙</p>
<p>招商局新江天輪專駛滬甬間、昨晨由甬駛滬、於四時四十分許、駛近鴨窩沙Block　House　Bony處、因有貨輪一艘、停泊抛錨於該輪航綫左則、當經轉舵繼續前進、不料其時適有滿載油簍之大號帆船一隻、揚帆駛來、迨發見後、亟改駛方向、並鳴汽笛警吿、時因東北風猛烈、帆船不易控制、遂與該輪互撞、船腹立被截毁、致海水湧進、立吿沉沒、</p>
<p>撞毀帆船　無法施救</p>
<p>肇事時、新江天輪係由大副兪廷元。二副龔道海·値班、該輪船長挪威人强生、T．H．Johnson因輪抵淞口外鴨窩沙、正擬登駕駛台値班、聞碰撞之聲、知已肇事、念奔上觀察、但見油簍數隻、及被毁木船、沉浮於白浪間、乃放下舢舨、設法撈救、則毁船之全體水夫老幼男女、均已失蹤、撈救的一小時、迄無效果、故卽鼓輪駛滬、向該局報吿、</p>
<p>船長强生　報吿經過</p>
<p>船長强生、向該局船舶科及航政局海關港務處報吿肇事經過、茲譯述致該局船舶科主任函如下、船舶科主任鈞鑒、今晨的五時、職輪進口、駛經鴨窩沙時、忽發生巨大之碰撞聲、職聞聲卽奔至駕駛台觀察、始發現係與一巨大之帆船相撞、時職輪正開足馬力前進、職當命急將輪舵向右以避免再與另一抛錨之輪船相撞、事後、並將船掉頭搜尋、至六時許、始在距鴨窩沙束一哩外、發現該撞毁之帆船惟並無人物漂浮、船中水手及船員、或被經過之他船所救起、或已溺斃、職輪大副二副、時均値班、新江天輪船長强生、二月十八日、</p>
<p>大副二副　呈報航局</p>
<p>上海航政界、昨接得新江天輪肇事之報吿、原文云、敬呈者、職輪今晨四時四十五分、由甬駛滬抵Block　HouseBony（鴨窗沙附近）時、天氣昏暗、陰雲密佈、東北風極烈、愼重駕駛、依向前進、時有貨船一艘、停泊抛錨、略在本船航綫左側、不料忽有帆船一隻、在本輪前面右梢、職當卽改駛方向、並以汽笛警吿、停車避讓、以致不及、船身略受擦過、因貨多船重、水浸船沈、該帆船並無行燈、對於海上設備、殊少週全、雖經本船停車搜尋、祇見油桶數隻、浮流水面、未見船上人員、無法可施、不得已、進口靠埠、特將經過情形、據實禀吿、敬呈上海航政局、大副兪廷元。二副龔道海。二月十八日、至帆船方面、迄未有呈報到局云、</p>
<p>帆船方面　尙無報吿</p>
<p>據記者探悉、新江天輪於前午五時許、駛離寗波、在鎭海港面、曾遭擱淺、後經猛駛出險、繼續前駛來滬、在途尙安、僅舵葉略受損毁、不意抵淞口外鴨窗沙時、仍肇慘禍、該輪雖未遭毀壞、但撞沉之帆船、竟致全船人員失蹤、誠不幸之至、航政局雖已得新江天輪之報告、而駁船方面、迄未有報吿到局、故處理甚感困難、昨僅向該輪船長强生。略加詢問而已、聞帆船失蹤男女、的二十人之多云、</p>

<p>製紙一業，自漢代以後，即爲吾國重要工業之一，贛湘蜀川浙粵諸省，均爲著名之產紙區域，而尤以江西一省所產爲最多。江西福建之連史紙毛邊紙，安徽之宣紙（主要產於是宣城，）以及雲貴之皮紙，均頗有名。惟製造方法簡陋，規模不大，皆爲舊式手工業生產。產量既少，紙貴　　不宜冷卻。　自社會文化事業（　）。　以　。</p>
<p>三十二年，　營業不振等關係，僅有老廠之改　，而無新廠之設立，迨歐洲大戰以後，情勢稍變，上海竟成造紙廠新年好踵而興，民十四有江南造紙公司之組織，民十五有天　之成立，民十六有民生之繼起（民十九改組爲民生裕記），源泰寰山兩　＃復於民十八年，上海造紙廠於民二十一年，美錦大中華兩廠於民二十三年，先後宣告成立。以上所舉者，僅說設　於本埠者而言，至於外埠，同時自亦有新式造紙廠之出現，如歐戰以後，江浙兩省有武　華　禾　　等廠之設立。目下更有　　之　　，皆其例也。　民國二十四年申報　　所載。上海一埠共　　造紙廠（連製　紙　　　及　　用紙者在內）十四家。　僅有資本三十餘萬元，每年產值亦不過六十餘萬元，欲與洋紙作全面之競爭。自屬困難，故目下仍有洋紙泛濫國內市塲之病象，而亟待國人設法挽救者也。</p>
<h3 id="c156">二·洋紙之進口 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>洋紙乃一　統之名稱，其實有普通用紙，捲煙紙，圖畫紙等等之區別，同時輸入之國別亦多，如瑞典，加拿大，日本，美國等，僅佔額較巨者而已。據海關當局統計，洋紙之輸入，按其主要類別，列表如次，以窺一　：（單位海關金）</p>
<p>註：普通用紙　用以印書印報　以　各國　對華洋紙貿易中所佔之地位：</p>
<p>民國二十四年各國對華輸入洋紙比較表（單位關　）</p>
<p>民國二十四年各國對華輸入洋紙比較表</p>
<p>從前表吾人可見輸入洋紙最多者爲美國，其次爲日本，再其次爲坎拿大與德國。其中尤可注意者，即日本對我國輸入洋紙數量之激增。按自九一八事變以后，日紙輸華至二十一年底已減至最低限度，降居不甚重要之地位，但嗣後因競談親善，日紙又源源來傳統，據製紙聯合會調查所得，僅去年上半年中，日紙向我國中部乃東北香港等地之輸入額，共　八〇，三八六千鎊，比前年同期增加一千餘萬鎊，外貨橫流，國產銷沉，國人所　注意者也。</p>
<p>至輸入之華紙，主要　地推銷，蓋上海爲全國工商業之　爲洋紙市塲之中心。例如二十三年　輸入之　通用紙（　　合計）爲七，五三〇，五三二　　，其中經過上海　達四，五一七，六八一　　，約佔總輸入額百分之四十五。至本埠之洋紙市況，容數　論之。（未完）</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>新生活運動，自蔣委員長倡導以來，茲已兩載，以其深合時代的需求，尤爲復興民族之要圖，用能蔚爲風氣，全國翕從。</p>
<p>回顧晚近以來中國之歷史，各種運動，相繼勃興。但其效果，或則僅見一二志士仁人之提倡；而未爲一般民衆所奉行；或則僅有一時的興奮，而未有持久的力量。獨新生活運動則異乎是！藍新生活運動者，乃係推行新政，復興民族，以及推進中國一切文化建設之原動力。新生活運動之基本要點，乃在本「茍日新又日新，日日新」之精神，以及本「以前種種譬如昨日死，今後種種譬如今日生」之決心，蕩滌一切沈滯在社會底層之惡習頽風；鏟除一切深中人心之頽廢習性；期以養成一種堅苦卓絕，中正不茍，向上奮鬥的新生活習慣；而使全國人民之生活，能日臻合理化，科學化，生產化，革命化，軍事化，現代化與藝術化者也。</p>
<p>夫生活者，忒人生一切活動之總稱。繁衍生命之種種行爲。倘使舉國上下，官吏則虛僞貪污，人民則散漫麻木，成人則腐化昏庸，靑年則墮落放縱；富者則繁瑣浮華；貧者則卑惡混亂，則欲圖國家紀綱之整飭，社會秩序之維持，以及整個民族國家之解放與復興，豈非輾轍背馳。故改造生活，非特僞挽救頽風，振發人心之要圖；抑亦僞復興民族，推行新政，以及建設一切文化之動力焉。</p>
<h3 id="c158">創導新運之蔣院長 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>考以往各種救國改造之運動，所以終難收效者，究其癥結，大部由於不切實際，不揣其本。蓋無論何種制度之推行，與社會風俗，人民習慣之關係，實至爲密切。中國過去之敎育，乃至一切政治，皆病於虛僞，而不求實際，以致法令無效，技術無用，機械無能。宦守相同，效率終異；技術相同，成就各殊；機械相同，功用不一。故任何國家，於革故鼎新之後，必須風以動之，敎以化之，而後其政治始得爲之治。蓋移風易俗之工作，其效較政敎爲尤急。新生活運動，爲　萬邦所共仰；然今日所以仍呈四維不張，綱紀廢弛之象；而列國甚且公然以無組織無敎化諸詞，爲喜笑怒罵之資者，此非我中國民族之無知，實由於後人之空言虛驕，不能行力耳。</p>
<p>故拳生活運動之實質，在力行，不在空言；新生活運動成功之關鍵，端在禮義廉恥之實踐，而不在種種形式上之宣傳。</p>
<p>王陽明一代大儒，深知我國民衆之病根，因創知行合一之說，其言曰：</p>
<p>「知之眞切篤實處，即是行；行之明覺精察處，即是知；」</p>
<p>「未有知而不行者；知而不行，只是未知；」</p>
<p>「聖學只一個工夫，知行不可分爲兩事；」</p>
<p>「知者行之始，行者知之成！」</p>
<p>顏元（飛　）李　（怒谷）生當明末；亦俱力行之說，以　在　。顏氏之言曰：</p>
<p>「人之爲學，心中　　，口　談論。　有千言　，不知身上行一　之爲實也。」</p>
<p>「審爲一端一節之實，無爲全體大用之　；」</p>
<p>「蓋　只向習行上　功夫，不可向　語　字上費力；　　之戰，名論語矣；　　　人所記，　　　是行。」</p>
<p>「　　無　　，只在行字　力，如　　　　　人衆　一，但　赴力　　。」</p>
<p>即爲移風易俗，擬發人心，推進國運之中心工作；亦即爲目前復興民族，極不可綏這基本運動也。</p>
<p>唯是此種運動之推行，端賴全國人民之自覺自力，以身作則，始能推己及人，普及全國，蔚爲時代之風尚，形成時代之力量。吾國本爲禮義之邦，先聖先哲之遺敎，久已。</p>
<p>其徒李　，師承其志；亦有言曰：</p>
<p>「經書乃備行藝之簿籍也，所以詔習行，非資徒讀也。」今逢新生活運動二週紀念之日；承本會徵及拙稿；遇愧無似，忝爲指導。深慮此救亡復興之基本運動，將仍蹈以往空言之覆轍；因緣其言，藉資共勉。今後新生活運動之成就如何，今後中國民族之命運如何，亦唯視今後國人之力行如何而已矣！</p>

<p>— 吳開先</p>
<p>新生活運動，已唱導了兩周年了。這兩周年中，中國的國難也一日深似一日了。到了今日，我們中華民族，實在已經踏上了生無疑存亡的岐路，再不容我們因循蹉跎，遲回瞻顧了。我們今日來紀念這兩周歲的新生活運動，我們必得想一想：新生活運動和匡救國難復興民族，究竟有多大關係。</p>
<p>有許多人，他們根本看不起新生活運動的，他以爲「這裏面並沒有什麽救國靈方，也不會有什麽復興民族的奇蹟。」眞的嗎？當眞是這樣，那新生活運動僅只是天下太平時的事業，在現在，眞是不需要的東西了。齊巧相反。我們之所以要唱導新生活運動，就因爲他與匡救國難復興民族，有著很大的關係緣故。</p>
<p>我們看一看，我們現在的社會風氣怎麼樣？一般人民的人生態度是怎麼樣？怯懦自私，麻木不仁，放浪頽廢，偷惰茍安，好行小慧，借公濟私，一切亡國沒落的朕兆，色色俱全。以前有一個日本民族學者，曾經根據中國許多舊小說，歸納出中國民族的種種不良品性來，說中國民族原本是劣等民族。這當然他有他的作用，使我們十分氣憤不能心服。然而我們平心靜氣一想，小說的描寫，固未足爲憑；而我們的人民習尚社會風氣，確有許多不是。我們還　能夠十分氣憤，我們只有自慚形穢。</p>
<p>現在，我們的民族已經快要踏上死亡線了。我們不能不死裏求生，力圖更生，不能不負起解除國難復興民族的重担。這付重担子，不是怯懦自私麻木不仁的人所能挑得起，也不是放浪頽廢，偷惰茍安的人所能挑得起，更不是一般借公濟私好行小慧的人可以挑著走的。卻卻相反，這行多人，做亡國奴，當賣國賊，是他的份兒：這一種人生態度社會風氣反而是解除國難復興民族前途的大敵。</p>
<p>新生活運動，便是要把這彌漫全民族的亡國風氣根本消滅，便是要使每一個中國人，革面洗心，脫胎換骨，從沒落的人生觀中自拔出來。所以我們所祈求的新生活，決不單是有些人所餘的「一個文明人最低限度的常識生活」；而是具有：</p>
<p>一個獻身國民革命致力復興民族的人生觀。</p>
<p>一種純潔堅貞大公無私的精神。</p>
<p>一種明禮義知廉恥負責任守紀律的良好品性。</p>
<p>等條件，而度著整齊清潔簡單樸素尅苦耐勞的生活的。只有度著這樣生活的人民，才能夠負担起匡濟國難復興民族的責任；也只有這樣的生活，才是我們國難期間所祈求的新生活。</p>
<p>我們檢閱過去兩年來新生活運動的經過，知道我們的程途還很遼遠；但是我們的民族和環境迫切地需要我們更加倍的努力呢！同志們！努力吧！</p>
<h3 id="c160">非常時期中的新生活運動 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 潘公</p>
<p>一九二六年　　公認　是什麽？</p>
<p>現代的　　是復雜的，而不是　純的，現在的世界是一個整個的有機組織，而不是漠不相關的。因爲交通的發展縮短了世界的行程，內爲工商的進步，增加了人類密切的連鎖，一國與一國的戰爭是常常影響到其他國家的利害，而被捲入戰爭的　　，過去的第一次世界大戰，及最近意阿戰爭，英國出面干涉，皆是給我們一個明顯的例證。所以我們雖抱定和平的志願不要戰爭，但在某種環境之下，也爲情勞所不許。世界的情形既如此的急迫，我國環境復非常的危險，帝國主義的戰爭，爲殖民地而迫而不得不出於戰爭，乃爲生存而戰爭，爲救亡而戰爭。既然是一種生死存亡的戰爭，我們應當如何審慎應付，以免於國家民族滅亡的慘禍！有人說：這是政府應負的責任，軍火的購置，交通的設計，糧食的屯積，外交的聯絡，都是政府所應做的事，而不是人民所能做到的。誠然，上面所述的種種是政府應有的準備，但是僅有上述的準備，是不是就有勝利的把握？現代的戰爭，不是僅靠戰場上的爭鬭，而是整個國民的相互鬭爭，國民質量的優劣，是戰爭勝敗的標準。政府所做的事不過是策劃指揮，而眞正的實力，完全還是在我們每一個國民身上。我們果眞能思想統一，步驟整齊，臨難不茍，耐苦耐勞，則四萬萬人如一人，而四萬萬人的力量，就可以造成一個絕大的力量。以這個絕大的力量，以應付現在非常的局面，一定可以自強制勝。但是這種絕大的力量如何養成？二年前，蔣委員長在南昌提倡新生活運動，早　昭示吾人，果能切實運行，這就是救亡國存的惟一切實方法。新生活運動，是提倡「禮，儀，廉，恥，而我國自鴉片戰爭以後喪權辱國的條約，不知訂了多少，一般人民仍懵然不覺，最近四年中帝國主義者的明取暗奪，尤使人產痛心疾首！口頭上是救國圖存，而實際上是荒嬉怠惰如故，這就是違背了新生活運動中「恥」字。換句話說：就是不知「恥」。所以我們要知「恥」，就應當實行新生活。現在各國都講求人種的改良，以圖養成優秀的國民，所以先天方面，都是提倡優生學，在後天方面，則注重敎育。可是我國情勢的危急，已迫不及待，提倡新生活運動，以輔助敎育的不及。所以新生活運動，也就是改進國民質量的運動。」</p>
<p>可是國民質量的改進，也決非一朝一夕之功，同時所謂國民的質量，也決非指某一方面而言，而是包括知識，技能，道德，體格，多方面的。在此非常時期中，當前最重要的目標，需要實踐的，就是「守紀律」「耐勞苦」。沒有紀律，則出不出力量；不耐勞苦，則百事無成。在兩國作戰的時候，前線戰士，因然要服從軍令，耐勞耐苦，就是在後方的人民，也要絕對遵守望法令，而給予侵略國的機會。在新生活運動綱要中有「新生活運動者，我全體國民之生活革命也。以最簡易而最急切之方法，滌除我國民不合時代不適環境之習性，使趨向於適合時代與環境之生活，質言之，即求國民之生活合理化。」故新生活，即合理的生活，就是適應時代環境的生活。總理曾說，中國人民是一盤散沙，我們要散沙能團結起來，那就非大家遵守紀律不可。中國人是生產落後的國家。是處於次殖民地位的國家，我們要節約消費挽救危亡，尤非耐勞耐苦不可。</p>
<p>新生活的推進，迄今已有兩年，在此二年之中，雖然收了一部份的效果，然　　大體，究未能轉移社會的風氣，大多數的人民，　未　荒嬉怠惰的習氣，尤其在　　　方面，仍然是浮　幼　，絕少　。</p>

<p>蔣先生提倡新生活今已二年、最近又講大學之道、壽鏞是一個書獃、到了六十一歲、仍在故紙堆中討生活、回想二年前在允華半月刊寫一篇新生活基本觀念、認新生活爲人類之新生命、人人思保此新生命、凡足以戕我生命者、一切視同蟊賊、功可疆成、名可疆立、勸大家以復禮喩義養廉知恥分作叫大部、以治其內、更以大綱中心理論公的等等爲實施之標準、又勸大家於實踐上格外注意、隨後又聽見蔣先生於新生活中提倡三化生活卞義、曰軍事化、藝術化、生產化、更覺得此三化眞眞是救國救人不二法門、近來又聽到蔣先生講大學之道、洋洋萬言、入人肌膚、壽鋪嘗謂事有損益、道無古今、孔子曰、溫故而知新、朱子云、故者舊所聞、新者今所得、蔣先生將古人治國平天下之道、體之於今日、世界大勢之所趨、而發揮無遺、不尙覇功而講王道、王道允在新民大學三大綱旣曰在明明德在新民在止於至善、又曰、周雖舊邦、共命維新、朱子云、新者、革其舊之謂也、茍日新、日日新、又日新、將一切舊染種種革盡、於是新生命乃可立定、所以新生活與大學之道、在在連貫、大學曰、如保赤子、心誠求之、雖不中不遠矣、保赤子是最尋常的事、何以引以爲喩、因爲赤子、亦不過求生活、倘生活上予以安定、赤子便不呱呱、新生活人人能做到、則人人可以不呱呱、所以認得新生活是新生命、現在想死裏逃生、祗有從這一條路走、走到這一條路、就是大學絜矩之道也、就是在明明德、在新民、在止於至善之道、願大家體念蔣先生一番提倡苦心、走此日新又新的大道、永永不可走到岐路上、自失了活活潑地、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>梅格聽時，頗覺得她去邀他們來楚沒有做錯；因爲這個常兒不但給她一種慰藉確知爲喬恩唱最後眠歌的，即是他所最愛好的那些童子的聲音，並且在他們的面上她見到他們郤已感受了德行感人最深時的純美，而他們當前奄化的賢良所給予的印象，將長留於他們的心中而資爲補益。小梅的頭放在她的膝上，小橋揑着她的手，常常注視着她，眼睛頗像他的父親，並且還有一些姿勢彷彿是在說道，　不要憂愁，母親；有我在這裏；在她的周圍又都是可靠和可敬愛的朋友；於是忍耐的虔誠的梅格放開了她的重憂，覺得她最好的帮助便是抱定「人生是爲服務的」那宗旨做去，正如她的喬恩所曾實行的。</p>
<p>那天晚上，月白風淸，梅莊的童子們照常坐在階沿上，他們自然要談到日問的事。</p>
<p>愛彌原是性急不過的，因此先開頭說道，「茀力子伯伯，是最明通的，勞笠伯伯最歡暢，可是喬恩伯伯只是最好；就我所見過的人裏，我只願像他」。</p>
<p>「我也如此。你們不聽見那些人今天吿訴老爸爸的話嗎？我死了以後有人也能這樣贊着我，我就心滿意足了」；拂朗說後，自恨以前還沒有能够領略得喬恩伯伯的好處呢。</p>
<p>「他們說些什麽」？解客問道，他今天頗爲所見諸種情景所感動了。</p>

<p>結白糖和糙色糖，在普通一班沒經騐的人想來，一定當結白糖比糙色糖來得甜；那知結果，却是相反。這個，正像面貌清秀的人，未必一定是有才幹，而聰穎的智者；面貌粗蠢的人，也未必一定是沒才幹，而愚　的庸人。那是一樣的例子。諺云：「聰明面孔笨肚腸，」這句話，一點不錯。</p>

<p>這似乎是一個通病。中等以上的學校，雖備國文一課，學生們對之，都無好感；即或有一二「鳳毛麟角」，那至少普遍地被認為「老朽」與「壽頭」。所以自命「時代青年」的男女學生，積極者，翻翻「夕陽文學史，」消極者，還是踢皮球。因此，考卷上韓愈變了清朝人，又何足為奇！</p>
<p>國文敎授上課，最好能先預備下一二斷故事，不論楊貴妃與武則天的宮閳史話，或岳飛風波亭歸天，總之，以能「引人入勝」為上。則學生尙可抬頭聽聽。若走上講台使念講義，或分析白居易文章的好處，那　多在三分鐘之內，磕睡者若干人，看副刋者若干人，寫信者又若干人…而不知老師之額角出汗也。然而，猶有在宿舍　躺着哼京調者焉。　然而。學生之國文程度，以意測之，必大佳無疑。那又　錯了，寫父母雙親大人「漆」下者有之，寫鬼鬼「崇崇」者有之，不會寫一張便條者亦有之，國文程度「一塌糊塗」者，十居九·五也。那麼他們為什麼不喜國文呢？這，我表妹回答最直截爽快：「你瞧那一本國文書籍會比原版西書漂亮一分的！」嗚呼，噫嘻，我知之矣！</p>

<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>洞庭東山與西山對峙，在汪洋三萬六千傾的太湖中，相距水程雖僅十八哩，然而維持兩山之間的交通的只有一條蔬菜船。至於那條蔬菜船是每天由東山裝蔬菜到西山來賣，並且兼趁人的。它每天來往二次，早晨由東山山前開出，到鎭夏江裏，傍晚再從鎭夏開會東山。不過它來的時候是載着一船蔬菜和幾個鄕親—東山人互相稱呼都呌鄕親—可是回去却剩了許多空籃子和幾個賣蔬菜的人了。</p>
<p>德賓，他九時那隻破小船的主人，他們夫婦兩口兒靠着撐菜船過了二十多個念頭。雖然夏天在太湖裏儘晒，冬天在太湖裏喝西北風，無論風雨寒暖，他們都把兩條性命緊在那隻小船上到太湖裏去掙扎的，可是生活倒還可以過去；而且會因此買了幾畝田和起了三間屋。</p>
<p>趁蔬菜船每人是十六個銅板船資，裝一担蔬菜也是十六個銅板；他們船上平均有十五個人十担蔬菜，再加了回去，這樣一來一回每天就有兩塊多錢可以收入。但是他們船上除了夫妻兩個兒子之也很省。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>照理，他們每天有兩塊多錢的進益，而開銷不會到一塊錢的，本來應該積舊得很多的錢了。可是聽說他們在表面上雖然造了三间屋和買了幾畝田，其實也欠了人家不少債；這原因是很簡單的，那因為德賓喜歡喝酒賭錢，女人呢，愛吃愛穿，所以雖勉强積得點，也實在極其有限的。</p>
<p>近來在洞庭東西兩山之間已經有一隻小汽油船在行駛了。於是在一般鄕親雖則感到了不少便利，而德賓的蔬菜船雖然照常開行，但生意却十分悽慘了！</p>
<h3 id="c207">顏眞卿是山東人 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 其中</p>
<p>本刋前刋蕉心君之「各省鄕賢質疑」一文，謂顏眞卿是浙江人，並引辭源所載「唐臨沂人」來證明其說。我覺得蕉心先生弄錯了，事關先賢籍貫，特來為之更正。</p>
<p>查浙江並無「臨沂」的地方，臨沂在山東省，古名呌「臨沂」，清代層改為「沂州府」，現在呌做「臨沂縣」。讀過論語的人，總知道「冠者五六人，童子六七人，港乎沂」的　句。讀過地理的人，也知道山東有一條呌做「沂河」的河而臨沂這地方便是在這沂河的旁邊（當然，沂河之旁還有一個呌做「沂水」的縣。）臨沂在山東南部，從江蘇省的東海到那裏不過約二百里，一切商品之載運到臨沂去，大都由江蘇海州搬入沂河中的船上的。因為臨沂由海州可以運到外貨，所以便成了魯南的商業中心。那裏有兩個省立中學，一個便是「臨沂中學」，還有一個是鄕村師範。在鄕村師範的牆壁中，可以從破碎的石塊上發現古碑的痕跡，中間也有顏眞卿的字跡。據臨沂人說，那裏是顏眞卿的家鄕，王義之也會到過臨沂，但不稱王義之是山東臨沂人。還有，顏眞卿又呌「顏魯公」，「魯」即山東，所以我以為蕉心君稱顏眞卿為浙江人是錯的。</p>
<h3 id="c208">雪中的西湖 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 曾今可</p>
<p>因為似乎覺得上海住厭了，我就於　　灭塞中　　杭州。杭州是「天堂」嗎？不一定，導「天堂」的槪念在現在也似乎很可以斟酌吧？然而，杭州是一個好地方，我很相信。杭州的空氣和上海的空氣是不同的。自然杭州的社會也也比上海的社會安靜。住在上海的人總是覺得自己老在忙亂中生活着，時刻使你不能不緊張，在杭州，就覺得一切都很和平，可以生活得很從容。當然，西湖和　隱天竺，也比所謂「十里洋場」更可愛。</p>
<p>幾次的大聲，把西湖妝飾得更美艷。「踏雪尋梅」，也是很有詩意的事。於是我和我的朋友步行到孤山去。我們所以不坐車，是要從容地賞玩雪後的湖山。這是我的朋友的高見。</p>
<p>我們像散步似得，慢慢地在湖邊走着。從第六工團到斷橋，「斷橋殘雪」已經很夠人欣賞，橋邊又新　了一座很雅致的小紅樓，十分可愛。如果讓一對詩人夫婦或二三妙齡少女住在裏面，湖山有知。一定是很愉快地歡迎着他們的伴侶；可惜這樣好的房屋，又在這樣好的地方，乃是衙門式的「導遊局」！我們走到了裏西湖的湖邊。蘇提像一根玉帝，束在西子的腰間。萬　披上了素裝，格外動人。在博覺會橋上放眼朝四面看去，眞是景物如畫，美不勝收。孤山梅花的清香已經到橋上來歡迎我們，我們只好放棄雪景到孤山去。放　亭冷清地，沒有一個遊人。孤山的梅花開得正好，便使我憶起「疏影橫斜水清淺，暗杏浮動月黃昏」的名句。想林　士，馮小青，蘇小小，蘇曼殊，他們大家都在九泉下愉快地欣賞着這美景，並且自幸長眠於　地吧？（我同時想起了日本熱海伊豆山的二千白梅。）</p>
<p>我的朋友是初次來遊的，每到一勝地，必留連　　，捨不得走開。到了孤山，看見許多的梅花，更其高興。我本來想折兩枝梅花回家去供在案頭的瓶裏，我的朋友勸阻我，我就沒有折。如果大家都折花，後來的遊人不是沒有花看嗎？</p>
<p>下孤山後，在晏殊上人墓前徘徊很久。這位天才詩人的薄命是值得同情的。兩年前，在南社　　席上，柳亞子先生把「晏殊全集」送給我，可以從他的遺著中想見他的文采風流。便道至岳　，遊人較多。我在岳廟買了岳飛手書的「滿江紅」，和「出師表」，還　了一張「雷　塔藏經」。回家已經是「黃昏」了。</p>

<p>賈多才沉吟了一會子，笑道：那也好，讓二位先回去問問。我現在假定一個數目罷。無論是誰，只要他出了準價錢，我們這裏，一定比他再加上一千元。譬如人家出一萬二，不能再加了，我這裏就是一萬三。北海搖搖頭笑道：賈先生這個辦法，有點兒不妥。倘若我和別人作好了圈套，把價錢講得大大的，賈先生也能照樣的加上一千塊錢嗎？賈多才又拾起手來，在耳朵邊，連連的擦了幾下，笑着微微的搖了幾下頭道：我想着，總不至於如此吧？比方說罷，你眞是把價錢定得高高的，出乎人情以外，你想我也能加以前塊錢嗎？你王府上人，若是眞打算賣了這塊地皮，騰挪幾個錢出來用，自然願意把生意作成，也不至於把地價抬到不可收拾的。北海淡笑了一聲道：那也不見得。有道是業不賣謀主。贾多才端起酒杯子來連喝了兩口，接上又斟上了一滿杯，端起來，作個要喝不喝的樣子，微笑道：此話誠然。可是有那脾氣古怪的人，有產　偏要賣給謀主。那為着什麼呢？就為的是需多掙幾個錢。說完了，突然的把笑容更加大起來，對着北海搖了兩搖手道：我說這話，並非勸你把產業賣給謀主。我是說我這人的脾氣就是如此。王先生，假如我有什麼東西，是你所圖謀的，我就肯賣給你，你相信不相信？他說了這句話，就瞪了大眼睛，向北海望着。北海也說不出來，是受了一種什麼刺激，只覺得臉上一陣發熱，連眼皮都有些抬不起來。賈多才這就不向他說話了，掉過來對王實誠笑道：這位王先生，你可別多心，買賣不成仁義在，縱然這地皮交易是拆散了我們還是朋友，在社會上作事，不能處處都瞧着錢說話，更不能處處都瞧着生意說話。你老哥將來如有用得著兄弟的時候，兄弟一定還是幫忙。來來，王先生，我給你滿上一杯。他說着話，可就把酒壺提起，向王實誠杯子裏斟了去，笑道：只管喝，喝醉了就到小弟房間裏去躺着。（四〇五）</p>

<p>— 行安</p>
<p>曾於去年十二月間指稱日本爲「國際强盜」的美國參議院外交委員會主席畢德門，頃又在參議院中發表重要演說，猛烈抨擊日本所採的對華政策？謂日本現已决心破壞九國公的，關閉中國門戶，美國亟應擴充海空軍，以維持和平條的的尊嚴云云。</p>
<p>畢氏的演說，是日本對華無限制侵略的反響。蓋目前的遠東問題，又成爲門戶開於主義與東亞獨霸主義對立的問題。日本欲封鎖中國的門戶，英美則堅持在華利益均霑，一九二二年由英美日法意比荷葡與中國簽定的九國公約，曾有尊重中國主權獨立與土地完整，及對各國商務利益，應遵守均等機會原則的規定。但此條的，自九一八而後，已爲日本破壞，是以英美不能坐視，屢與日本發生衝突。畢氏的攻繫日本，原因亦卽在此。</p>
<p>然畢氏的嚴峻言詞，對於危急的遠東時局，雖不無裨益，要亦徒托空言。日本的破壞九國公的，事實已極明顯。儘管日本外務省當局聲明，「日本對於東亞的政策，以確立和平爲目的，决非打破門戶開放原則，或以武力獨佔東亞，」及日本報紙答覆，「日本從未侵犯中國主權，又無將來侵犯中國的意圖」。土地的被侵佔，冀東二十二縣的被掠奪，以及華北幾省的被控制，這不是東亞是什麽？這不是侵犯主權是什麼？這種掩耳盜鈴的强辯，亦愈見其野暴露而已。但九國公的簽字國，對於日本的舉動，却只能以幾句空言來表抗，未敢作有效的制止。遂使橫行無忌的野心家擾亂東亞的和平。故我們破壞九國公的者，雖爲日本的武力，而各關係國之未能實踐是條的所規定務，亦有以致之。</p>
<p>其實我們作此言，亦並不希望各國因爭取利益，來替中國出力。我們只是說明各國之不能遵從條的的義務。我們爲維持國家的生存，我們自有我們應盡的責任。畢氏的演說，無論講的怎樣嚴厲，亦恐未定以警醒日本的迷夢。英國官界觀察的最明白，謂畢氏之言，「僅爲發揮反日的情緒，未可由此斷定美國因日本的向外擴展，行爲越軌，而將出於强硬行動，加以阻止。」卽英國亦承認「英國本身，並未覓得反抗日本的途徑。」故爲求中國的主權獨立與土地完整，還有待於我國人自己的努力。</p>

<p>— 華之</p>
<p>已經是春天了，都市是敏感的，或許在那廣闊的行人道上看到穿春季新裝的摩登仕女了。但是從那嚴寒小鎭上釋放出來的我，對於那逼人的天氣還有餘驚以的。自從我到這小鎭上後，許久時候沒有通過音訊，你正在奇怪我這個人難道寫一封書信的時間都沒有嗎？這就是嚴寒的冬天所賜於我的。到這鎭上來的時候還沒有過廢勝的十二月望日，到鄉鎭上來收帳是最不費力的事，他們早已籌備了欵子等你的帳單送來。以最慢的時日來佔計，一個星期再不會過頭的：但是當我收全了帳欵預備動身的時候，冬天虎起了面孔，執行它的權威了：是漫天的大雪。你在田岸上走路，回顧你足跡所走過的地方，已經搜尋不出影蹤來了。於是我像一個流浪人一樣，終天困居在小旅舍裏。旅舍是那樣狹小，彷彿鳥籠似的用最廉價的木板分隔開來的。達里的小火輪旣停駛之後，沒有方法去，找到一份報紙，而想買幾本什麽書籍來消遣的話，更是十分困難的事。我沒有辦法來打發這歸心如箭的日子。躺在床上吧，隔室旅客的悠長的嘆聲，更容易使我想起我的家—是十二月下旬了啊，一個家是並不像一個單身漢那樣容易過年的！我的白髮的老母，我的年靑的妻子，我的幼小的兒女，他們都是依閭盼望着我的歸來，或許他們在輪船到埠的時間到碼頭去歡迎我，這該是如何地使他們失望呵！</p>
<p>旅舍老闆也是個外鄉人，他很歡迎我這個每年到來的顧客，我們是很熟識了。他空閑的時候，提着水烟袋到我房里來談天，他能够一根紙煤接到一根的和你從午後談到黃昏。然而他不會說笑話，他慣會說使人嘔氣的話，我很討厭他，但是我沒有理由拒絕他到我房里來。我心里是那樣矛盾，最好他報吿我一個汽輪明天啟行的消息，那卽使他和我談到天明，我也能興奮地提着行囊，踏着泥濘的雪道趕到輪船碼頭去，一點不像隔宿沒有睡眠的人。有一天晚上，那是我們故鄉送灶的日子哪，到晚飯時候他還沒想離開我的房間，我正想用這理由來下逐客令的時候，店里的小厮端着一盤相當豐盛的菜餚到我房里來了。老闆放下了他的水烟袋，把一盤盤的菜端到桌的中央，用那種低弱的聲昔對我說：「內人特地做了幾個菜，我們飮幾杯酒如何？」他是那樣躊躇不寗，恐怕我會突如其來拒絕他的樣子。但是我很威謝他的，我的每一個細胞需要怎樣興奮一下，我感謝他爲我做了一件我心里所想不起來的事—飮幾杯酒，雖然我的酒量是很窄小的。那天當然是酩酊大醉，就是那一天該是最痛快的日子了！</p>
<p>這里，我還想吿訴你一件事，那末許多日子像一隻鬥敗的公雞似的關在狹小的房間內，我每天盼望着黑夜提早降臨，有一個酣暢的睡眠該也是痛快的事吧！但是這小鎭上的巡査隊到是很出色的，四個人一組，三個人一隊，執着紅朱印的三角旗，天沒有落黑，就來檢査旅客，那樣子我一時簡直想不出一個適當的比喻來，他們為首的一個執著旅客循環薄，姓什麽，叫什麽，什麽地方來，什麽地方去，做什麼事，有時候他們更毫無理由地檢査你的行囊。每天從下午四五時起，到天明止，你要受到十次以上的審問，簡直沒有安睡的時候。後來我就開了門睡覺，他們進來的時候，我沒有等到他們的審問，就像背書似的背一個乾凈。所以我更得感謝我的店主人，那天喝醉了酒，那些束西不知怎樣檢査來着的？</p>
<p>但是那些東西沒有一個好人，日里我常常過到他們在旅舍的空房間里威逼茶房呌花姑娘，發洩過了獸慾，一個錢不化地溜之大吉。晚上却又在三角旗之下裝着一副正經面孔。據說他們是特地從縣城調來冬防的，你想想罷，這個冬天該有多少人要受到他們的壓迫，侮辱呢？</p>
<p>這小鎭上呌人看不過去的事悄多着，我像一个特赦犯似的逃了出来，待我有機會的時候再和你細細的談罷。</p>

<p>— 艾美</p>
<p>二月里，一陣恐怖的旋風從三百里外的虎頭山捲將過來，吹散了鎭上死沉沉的空氣，又械落了人們所有憂慮的心！祖父尋常起的早，在這樣年頭心里更加憂慮的緊，雖說他是上了年紀的人了，却還和年靑時代一樣的結實，茁强。天氣還只有朦朦光的時分，沒出太陽，也沒有一絲陰霾的雨意，灰鬱鬱的，屋簷角在悄悄的刮着風。大家都還沒起床，而祖父底慣熟的咳聲却以前廂房，悶燥的響將過來，接着又聽到了也起動和開門聲。</p>
<p>咳淸了一陣嗓子，他便　一條家製的短板凳上坐着，精神非常地亢奮，嘴里啣着那根禿了頭的老烟筒，悠閑的抽着，心里却正在盤算；勞作，市價，耕牛和一家十幾口子的吃用……，於是他嘆息了，六歲的那一年他跟爸拿着糞算到處去檢猪狗糞起，直到五十五歲的現在，他從沒曾感到自己衰老過的，他剛强能幹，像老狐狸一般的用着手段應付着世務，然而現在，他却只有慨嘆。…</p>
<p>和祖父一樣，是村里老前輩的蹺脚伯公在這一向兒，也很感憂慮，他看不過鎭里那野馬般的截髮，赤膊子，講文明的女學生，他看不過一石米十二元的價格，他更看不過年靑人喜吃，懶做，好事，胡鬧，總之他看不過現世界的一切，於是他也感覺衰老了。</p>
<p>這一對老前輩，曾有幾十年的交往，爲着有什麽想不通，祖父便常上他家去，蹺脚伯公接着，兩個老頭兒都快活的笑了，好像都突然年靑起來似的。而蹺脚伯公也常爲着螞蟻一般細肖的事過來回訪　。</p>
<p>幾年前祖父便想積點錢建置一條耕牛，但是沒有錢，於是便拄着拐披上蹺脚伯公家去，剛好蹺脚伯公也爲了自己要進口壽木在家里的事過來。這對老頭兒在路上碰着了，於是便相偕着到田塍上那株鳥柏樹下，坐着。祖父便慨嘆着一個農民沒耕牛的苦况，蹺脚伯公也說明了自己幾十年來牛馬般的勞苦拖磨，難道就連一口見得人樣的壽木也沒有嗎？不！他得自己積點錢，眼看那個不肖兒子是再也不會替他打算了，因爲第五個孫兒子現在又快要生下。他們嘆息着，互相報着打算，以他們每天的汕鹽醬醋起，一直到怎樣節省幾筒旱烟止，末了他們又拄着拐杖回家。</p>
<p>晚飯後，祖父便宣佈他底治家新政，他已好幾年沒上田地了，現在也肩起鋤來跟兒係們上田地去，爲的是他可以在麥田里多植幾株靑菜，好拿着上鎭去賣錢。回到家，又拄起拐杖到處巡視，呵斥，看誰多把一根自來火糟塌了，看誰多把油燈里的火油浪費了，於是他便紅起面，敲着拐杖，大聲數說着日食難，儉省要緊。這樣，他又在他床頭上放置着一個小木櫃，上面挖個小洞，用銷鎖住櫃門呌家中大大小小必須要儉省食用，自動拿銅板去捐輸。這樣，祖父很快地把銅板化成角子，又把角子兌成白亮亮的現洋，用紙包着，牢牢的放在腰帶里，偕着蹺脚伯公上鎭去。鎭上有家言辦的農民銀行，一百五十里內是被認爲信用挺好的，祖父在行里辦妥了交涉，把錢存上了，小心的把存欵薄在腰帶里放好，滿足地回家了。當天晚上，祖父第一决喝着白乾，激動的顫着聲，訴說一個可怕的興運將要降臨到我們家里來；因爲我們不久將有一頭肥肥胖胖的耕牛。</p>
<p>「到那時」祖父感動地說：「你們便可以驕傲的楊着鞭，大着可以村里趕上山坡，入家一定都要爲這頭不平常的耕牛以屋子里被吸引着出來，用着吃驚的眼睛看着，美慕地問道：這條體面的耕牛是誰的？而你們，孩子們一定要大着聲，不要懼怯，答道：我們底祖父積着錢買的！於是看的人便小心地摸着牛身，嗟嘆着，把這消息傳遍全鎭，就連區長也聽到了……」祖父興奮着，流淚了</p>
<p>第二天，我們便被允許了有一頓肉吃。但是祖父的幸福日子沒過好久，便破滅了！鎭上捲着恐佈的旋風，村里更風傳着農民銀行要關門了，蹺脚伯公靑着面，喘着氣，拐杖在石門　上敲的滴滴地響着，帶來了這個不吉利的消息。祖父吃了驚，從床頭拖出那根拐杖，小心的開着那個小木櫃的鎭子，拿出那本銀行里的存欵冊，偕着蹺脚伯公大踏步的望鎭上跑。家里死般的柔靜着，黑雲蜜罩住了一切小空隙，一個可怕的威脅在慢慢地生長着，膨大起來了。</p>
<p>下午，祖父又拄着拐杖回來，他失意，絕望，一句話也沒說，坐在一條低木凳上呆呆的發着楞，想了一會，他便悽然的嘆息着，顫巍巍的跑進房去，抱着那個裝銅板的木櫃子出來，狠命的望天井一摔，小木櫃碰在石頭上轟然一聲巨響便碎裂了，銅板散滿了一地，祖父却眼瞪瞪的站着，握緊住兩手，咬着牙關，大家把他一看，他那兩隻衰老的眼睛，却已滴溜溜的淋下一兩行淚痕了。</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>我們終於在一家小店住了下來。那時候西天正織着五色的斑爛的雲錦，街上每個行人的油滑的臉都反映着那美體的紅光。我那同伴正在洗面，一面打諢着說：</p>
<p>「拖這盆洗臉水燒了燒，凖可以弄出半斤鹹出來的。」</p>
<p>這小店有一個小天井，幾個客人正在那裏喝大杯的茶，我們都是同鄕，而是都是要到　椥去的。</p>
<p>旣然是一個新番客，大家就爭着問唐山長，唐山短了。他們第一句是問到日本的事情。一個老番，用那半鹹半甜的潮州話問我；</p>
<p>「你是讀書人，你說中國會興不會興？要不要等眞命天子出來？」</p>
<p>「我說，」另一個人插嘴了，他是一個藥材商人，時常來往於西貢同汕頭的。「中國要是再這樣子下去，準興盛不了。你想，情形一年比一年的糟，我們又沒有飛機同兵艦，而且……」</p>
<p>「什麼都是氣數，」我的朋友搶着說，「你不信，岳飛要救大宋，但來了個秦檜，大宋該亡，不是氣數麽？什麼都沒有用，什麽都沒有用！」</p>
<p>「要是照你這樣說，我們是命裏該死的了。我不信，我們是中國，古今來世界第一大國哩，你的話全個無譜，我不信。你說是不是，先生？」那老人說。</p>
<p>他看一看我，我可有點茫然了，不曉得怎樣回答。他們離家鄕太久了，長年的生活又使他們除痛苦之外再得不到半點精神的食糧。你想笑他們的無知麽？但他們都有一顆熱烈的心的。</p>
<p>天是緩緩暗下來了。小院子里時時掠過來一絲凉風，南國的星斗好像分外璀燦，又亮又光，嵌在那蔚藍的天幕上。四處飄來了各種奇怪的虫聲，共中亦似乎雜着嘶嘶的蛇鳴。</p>
<p>當我從外而轉回來，我那位相信運命的朋友已經熟睡了，打着很大的鼾聲。小院落里，那位老同鄕還噙着一枝長姻管吸得出神。另外二個人，一個似在打肫，可是一個却想談着批水的行情，一個問了，一個等到好半天才答一句，不久，二個就都熟睡了。</p>
<p>我正在昏肫的當見，突然有人在我肩頭打了一下。我就立刻驚醒過來，有微弱的月光之下，我看見右手邊正是那個年老的人，他的神色是誠懇而又還嚴肅。</p>
<p>「我們中國應該强些，不過，先生，吿訴我，我們能够强盛麽？」</p>
<p>我沒有回答，呆呆地瞪着這個老人</p>

<p>。他的眼睛像著了火一樣。</p>
<p>「我吃了半世苦，全是因為中國太衰了。我在西貢給一家安南人欠了帳，可是法院沒有讓我打贏官司。我家裏有個孩子，想到這裏來幫我的忙，不過，新客衙又要他二百多和身　。別國人是沒有的，只怨中國太衰了。」他頓了頓，接著又說：「前年聽說同外國人打仗，要募捐，我把一半的錢捐了，可是現在還沒有戰勝的消息。咳……」老人歎了口氣。</p>
<p>我默默地不作一聲，這悄默引起了他對我的懷疑。他張大著嘴巴，用驚疑的口氣問我：「什麼？你聽不懂我的話？還是……」</p>

<p>一曲愛情歌的醉人節奏推動了整個故事的旋律，這個甜歌作成了老高和二姐月閑媒介，在這個惱人的歌聲中老高又是沒有黃金而又沒有女人，在這個甜歌的節奏中間，不知經過了多少重的節變，多少重的波折，最後的結束卻是二姐月閑為這個歌而自殺，男的那個粗喉嚨也誓不再唱這個可惱的歌。</p>
<p>老高的硬戲是不用說了，二姐演一個從狂歡到悲感的歌女有非常的情感，黃耐霜和謝雲卿皆很賣力，尤光照與朱秋痕的演出多是幽默，吳村的女兒小珠姑娘可愛極了。</p>

<p>不過，無數地愛好戲劇藝術的新使伕的相繼參加的鼓勵也委實不少。</p>
<p>他們關於演出劇本的選擇，是非常嚴格地，一再的更改，現在決定了的有田漢的新劇作「號角」，劇中有歌二支，由該社淺影飾大姑娘主唱演出的效果如何，他們也不能自信有侍於將來社會的批判。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Remarks on the Second Anniversary of the New Life Movement: Achievements Not as Good as the First Year, Failing to Meet Our Expectations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing issued remarks on the second anniversary of the New Life Movement. The original text is as follows: Today is the second anniversary of the New Life Movement since its inception. Regarding the future work program and the central tasks that should be emphasized, the General Association will issue a written statement separately, which need not be repeated. This movement has already lasted for two years. From today onwards, it marks the beginning of the third year. We know that the success or failure of this movement not only affects the world's view of our country but also concerns the survival of our nation. On this second anniversary, our most important task is to conduct a frank and faithful examination of the past achievements as a reference for future efforts. I dare to say frankly that since the New Life Movement began, although the area of implementation has expanded day by day, the items and scope of work have increased day by day, and the implementing organizations and personnel have also increased from time to time. According to this year's statistics, labor service corps have been organized in various provinces, cities, and railways. The total number of members exceeds 100,000. Members can actively participate in people's training, mass education, disaster relief, and sanitation, and achieve considerable results. However, in terms of the overall effectiveness and actual situation, it cannot meet our expectations and achieve the original purpose. Not only that, it can even be said that there is regression without progress. Comparing the second anniversary with the first anniversary, the achievements are not as good as those in the first year. This is very distressing and shameful. How to remedy this shortcoming is a question that everyone should seriously reflect on. In the past year, I have traveled to many places and paid close attention to the actual work of our New Life Movement, whether there has been progress in the general social situation and national life compared with before the New Life Movement. I dare to say that except for a very few places, the two things of cleanliness and orderliness have not been achieved. Even in the cities, chaotic phenomena can be seen everywhere on the streets and roads. Especially in public places or transportation hubs, such as docks and stations, people coming and going do not appear to have received order training, and those who have guiding responsibilities, such as military police, police chiefs, etc., cannot actively fulfill their responsibilities, even turning a blind eye. On the contrary, a few places in rural areas are relatively clean and can implement this movement. As for government agencies, they should be models for the general society and the people. Civil servants are also more knowledgeable and should bear the responsibility of leadership. However, according to my observations, there are very few who can earnestly meet the requirements of the New Life Movement, be orderly and energetic, and be worthy of the standards of modern life. We can see slogans of the New Life Movement everywhere now, but we rarely see the actual effects of the New Life Movement. We can see groups or agencies promoting the New Life Movement everywhere, but we rarely see that a large number of people have truly received the effects of the New Life Movement. As for the general society, being able to express the four virtues of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame in food, clothing, housing, and transportation, its way of life can achieve militarization, production, and art, and practice labor service, possess the virtues of mutual assistance and cooperation, and have the modern spirit of loving the country and the nation, that is of course even less. Our country has a large population, the social situation is too complex, and the old habits are too deeply rooted. It is certainly not easy to make the entire nation undergo a major transformation in a short period of time. When we first promoted the New Life Movement, we set it as starting from the shallow to the deep, from the easy to the difficult, and extending from oneself to others, starting from the most ordinary things. That is also what we meant. The criticisms I made above are not demanding or blaming, nor are they completely negating our existing achievements and the hard work of those who promote the New Life Movement. However, the New Life Movement is a movement of education and moral reform. In theory, it is more difficult to see results at the beginning, but after it has been implemented, it should be able to continue to progress, one year faster than another. However, the fact is not entirely true. If the foundation of the first phase is not solid, then the efforts of the second phase are lacking. If the cadres and those with leadership responsibilities have not fulfilled their responsibilities, then the general public who are being guided have not deeply understood the importance of the New Life Movement's meaning. I hope that our comrades who are responsible for promoting the New Life Movement and the general compatriots will all conduct a deep reflection. In the past, our national habits had two major shortcomings, which were the main reasons why general undertakings did not make progress. The first is a lack of sincerity, and the second is a lack of enthusiasm. Because it is not based on sincerity, it is very tense at the beginning, but it is inevitable to become lax after a while. Everything is only to deal with the past, not to seek actual results. For example, when promoting the New Life Movement in various places, it often happens that when someone is about to inspect, it is particularly tense temporarily, and then it is relaxed immediately, and no one cares about it. Or in places that are easy to detect, attention is paid to cleanliness, and in places that are slightly remote, it is not seriously implemented. This kind of intermittent practice, only doing superficial behavior, the general people will naturally respond with falsehood, and will not sincerely listen to guidance. As for the second point, if we lack enthusiasm, we will not feel interested in anything. Although it is not intentional slackness, we will ultimately not be able to muster the courage to move forward vigorously. As a result, it is inevitable that we will be close to perfunctory. Not only will progress not be rapid, but also the existing achievements will often not be maintained. In the past work of the New Life Movement, it is inevitable that there will be this kind of procrastination and malpractice. The personnel who are promoting it are therefore reduced to being passive, unable to lead by example, and unable to enthusiastically study methods of promotion suitable for various environments. The general people also lack enthusiastic response and cannot develop a universal, natural, and lasting atmosphere. In fact, this entrenched habit of procrastination and hypocrisy is the evil consequence of not knowing etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and it is also the main reason for the disintegration and demise of our country and nation. If we want to become a nation suitable for modern survival, we must thoroughly change this entrenched habit. In short, the New Life Movement is not an ordinary social reform movement in the world, but an urgent movement to save the country and survive. In ordinary reform-style social movements, the main purpose is to improve and refine, which means that it is already good, but it is still required to be better. Therefore, it may be possible to gradually seek progress, and it does not matter if the progress is slower. As for the New Life Movement that we advocate, it is a movement of yesterday's death and today's life, that is, a movement of resurrection, because the national spirit, morality, and lifestyle are really too unsuitable for the modern era, and the survival of the entire nation has already encountered serious danger. Therefore, we want to fundamentally transform the lives of the people in order to seek the revival of the nation. Therefore, compatriots from all over the country must not regard the New Life Movement as only the affairs of a few promoters, but should regard it as something that is closely related to their own interests. As for civil servants, police, military police, and the education sector, those who have leadership responsibilities, as well as cadres promoting the New Life Movement, should muster enthusiasm and take responsibility, and always follow the standards of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and the established work program, and continue to work diligently and realistically. I dare to believe that the work of the New Life Movement will be able to achieve the mission of reviving the nation. Finally, I also hope that all compatriots in the country will not forget the four-sentence summary of implementing the New Life Movement: Etiquette is a proper attitude, righteousness is a correct behavior, integrity is a clear distinction, and shame is a thorough awareness.

<p>Tianjin - Comparison of the number of foreign residents and troops stationed in Tianjin: British residents 2,000, troops 1,000; American residents 500, troops 800; French residents 500, troops 1,700; Italian residents 80, troops 400; Japanese residents 20,000, troops 2,000. The number of foreign residents and troops stationed in Qinhuangdao, Yu, Ping, and eastern Luan are not included. Japan uses this point as a reason to strengthen the troops stationed in North China. According to the proportion of residents in various countries not reaching half of the troops, the proportion of Japanese residents and troops is exactly the opposite. In order to maintain safety, it is necessary to increase the number of troops. When the new soldiers arrive, the total number of people will not reach one-fourth of the number of residents, which is still less than the proportion of various countries.

<h3 id="e12">Second Anniversary of the New Life Movement <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Gao</p>
<p>Today marks the second anniversary of the advocacy of the New Life Movement. Initiated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, this movement, characterized by its simplicity and practicality, aimed to transform societal customs through easily implementable methods. It sought to awaken the ignorant, inspire the cowardly, revitalize the declining, and rectify the corrupt. Its impact was intended to ensure the health of society and elevate the nation to a state of revival. The populace, long adrift and suffocating under oppressive conditions, was drawn to this burgeoning movement, almost universally embracing it with hope, reinvigorating their spirits, and eagerly anticipating its success. This is why the New Life Movement was launched in Nanchang, the location of the military headquarters, and within two years, it flourished and spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>The core objective of the New Life Movement is to rationalize the lives of the people, eliminating outdated habits unsuitable for the times and the environment, and steering them toward a lifestyle aligned with the era and circumstances. This was explicitly stated in the New Life Movement Outline promulgated by Chairman Chiang. Chiang's reasons for initiating the New Life Movement were also poignantly articulated in the outline: "Today, the general psychology of our society is characterized by complacency and lethargy. This manifests in actions where good and evil are not distinguished, public and private are not differentiated, and the fundamental and the superficial are not understood. The blurring of good and evil leads to confusion between right and wrong. The failure to differentiate between public and private results in inappropriate acquisition and disposal. The lack of understanding of the fundamental and the superficial causes priorities to be reversed. Consequently, officials become hypocritical and corrupt, the people become disorganized and apathetic, the youth become decadent and dissolute, and adults become degenerate and mediocre. The wealthy indulge in extravagance and frivolity, while the poor wallow in squalor and chaos. The outcome is the collapse of national discipline, the destruction of social order, the inability to resist natural disasters, the failure to quell man-made calamities, and the incessant occurrence of internal troubles and foreign aggressions, ultimately causing harm to individuals, society, the nation, and the race." These words serve as a sharp critique of contemporary society. The impetus for all reforms stems from discontent, and it is essential to first understand the crux of the problem in order to determine the appropriate course of action. Chairman Chiang, having recognized the hypocrisy and corruption of officials, the disorganization and apathy of the people, the decadence and licentiousness of the youth, and the degeneration and mediocrity of adults, naturally sought to rectify the corruption of officials, galvanize the apathy of the people, correct the decadence of the youth, and cleanse the degeneration of adults. Thus, the four virtues of "Propriety," "Justice," "Integrity," and "Conscience" became the cornerstones of the New Life Movement. Chairman Chiang explained "Propriety" as a respectful attitude, "Justice" as righteous conduct, "Integrity" as clear discernment, and "Conscience" as genuine awareness. I, in my humble opinion, would further extend their meaning: "Propriety" means showing love and respect to peers with a humble attitude; those who engage in partisan strife and arbitrary bullying lack propriety. "Justice" means promoting mutual assistance among fellow humans with a magnanimous spirit; those who are treacherous and deceitful, harming others for their own benefit, lack justice. "Integrity" means earning a livelihood through legitimate income; those who seek undue advantage and make unwarranted demands lack integrity. "Conscience" means upholding one's dignity with unwavering righteousness; those who are obsequious and fawning, seeking only to please, lack conscience. If everyone could clearly distinguish between these nuances, why worry about the failure to uphold the four cardinal principles?</p>
<p>Following the New Life Movement's procedure of progressing from the simple to the complex, the past two years of work have focused on strictly enforcing rules and cleanliness, advancing to the promotion of the Three-Pronged Program, which has already yielded noticeable results. It is reported that future plans will expand from urban areas to rural villages, with the core focus on effectively expanding public self-defense, promoting national economic development, and supporting the development of social education. The difficulty of the work is far greater than the simplicity of the past, and the importance of its nature is forming an entire development. It is earnestly hoped that those promoting the New Life Movement will review past achievements, maintain consistent dedication, and constantly bear in mind the foundation of propriety, justice, integrity, and conscience in order to carry out the work of self-improvement and helping others. The signs of the success of the New Life Movement have already shone in our eyes.</p>

<p>Tokyo — Military authorities here have stated that Russia and Japan must first resolve all pending issues between them before concluding a non-aggression treaty. It is reported that the Minister of the Army stated at this morning's cabinet meeting that conflicts frequently occur between Russia, "Manchukuo," and "Manchuria"-Mongolia, the cause of which is the unclear demarcation of boundaries. An official from the Ministry of the Army attended this morning's cabinet meeting to explain the details of the incident on January 30, when "Manchukuo" rebel soldiers retreated into Russian territory after fighting with the Japanese-"Manchukuo" allied forces north of Suifen River. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Moscow — Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Ota, held lengthy and significant talks with Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov on the 15th and 16th of this month. Both parties have remained silent regarding the content of the talks, but according to this agency's correspondent, the two discussed not only finding solutions to the recent Russian-"Manchukuo" border incidents but also exploring the possibility of establishing a general agreement between Japan and Russia to resolve all outstanding issues amicably. If such an agreement could be reached, the two countries would dispatch three committees tasked with the following: 1) resolving Russian-"Manchukuo" border incidents; 2) resolving "Manchuria"-Mongolia border incidents; and 3) demarcating all unresolved disputed points along the Russian-"Manchukuo" and "Manchuria"-Mongolia borders. According to semi-official sources, discussions on the issue of a non-aggression pact between Russia and Japan are not planned at this time. As for rumors that Litvinov will visit Tokyo, the intention is merely to gauge the atmosphere and is not definite. Regarding the Russian-"Manchukuo" border incident, Japan advocates that the arbitration committee jointly appointed by the three parties—Japan, Russia, and "Manchukuo"—should consist only of representatives from the three parties involved. The Soviet Union, however, insists that commissioners of other nationalities should participate, and the dispute remains unresolved. It is likely that a compromise solution may be found. In addition, it is reported that Ota and Litvinov also discussed the issue of mutual establishment of consulates between Russia and "Manchukuo." Ota explained on behalf of "Manchukuo" that the Soviet Union has one consulate general and three consulates in "Manchukuo," while "Manchukuo" has only two consulates in the Soviet Union, which seems disproportionate.

<p>Kulen [Urga]—Reports from Kulen state that Mongolian authorities have discovered and collected numerous Japanese military supplies at the site of the conflict between Mongolian and Manchurian troops on February 12. In Mongolian territory (i.e., at the site where the Burentegshe post was attacked), eight kilometers from the border, a box was found containing fourteen 75mm caliber Japanese rifle bullets (already used), two brand-new machine gun belts (with lead seals), Japanese hand grenades, a burner for a burning motor, and various daily necessities for soldiers. These items were abandoned by Japanese and Manchurian troops when Mongolian reinforcements arrived and they retreated from Mongolian territory. One Japanese tank was destroyed during the battle, and many fragments of its shattered armor were found at the scene. In addition, 123 empty Japanese field artillery shells, one three-star red shoulder strap (military insignia removed), several zinc cartridge magazines, Japanese gas masks, and other military supplies were found. The Japanese troops attacked eight guard post tents and set them on fire when they retreated, but Mongolian soldiers arrived and extinguished the flames, saving all but three tents. The discovery of these military supplies completely proves that the Japanese claim that Mongolian troops invaded Manchurian territory, leading to the conflict, is entirely fabricated. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo—Major Arisue of the Military Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Army attended the cabinet meeting on the 18th and reported in detail on the border situation and the Jinchan Gou incident. The main points are as follows: The incident of Russian soldiers crossing the border occurred at Jinchan Gou on the eastern Russian-Manchurian border on January 30. Investigations have revealed that the Soviet Union instigated border guards of "Manchukuo" to desert, and it is clear that there were Soviet Russian officers and soldiers among those directing the deserters. One of the Russian soldiers who crossed the border was shot dead by the Japanese army, and their bodies and weapons were abandoned in Manchurian territory. However, the Russian side is propagating that the Japanese and Manchurian armies crossed the border. The facts of the Soviet instigation of Manchurian soldiers to rebel and cross the border have already been proven. The military is now lodging a serious protest with the Russian side. Not only are disputes occurring repeatedly on the eastern border, but also on the Outer Mongolian border, which are also planned by the Soviet Union. The recent disputes in the border area can all be regarded as conscious efforts by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Russian Red Army is currently making great efforts to strengthen its military equipment. Its forces in the Far East initially consisted of only four infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions, numbering tens of thousands of troops. However, since the September 18th Incident, the force has increased to twelve infantry divisions and three cavalry divisions, with an army of over two hundred thousand troops, as well as 900 aircraft, 900 tanks, and over 500 armored vehicles. Furthermore, 3,000 aircraft from the European front can be transferred to the Far East immediately. With the enhanced maintenance of the Siberian Railway, the troop transport capacity has greatly increased, reaching several times that of the Russo-Japanese War. Moreover, the construction of trenches and fortresses in key areas on the Russian-Manchurian border has cost 160 million yuan, totaling several thousand, not only for defensive purposes but also as bases for attack, which is of great value. Last year, there were as many as 136 incidents on the Manchurian-Russian and Manchurian-Mongolian borders, all of which occurred due to the unclear demarcation of the borders. Therefore, it is currently proposed to the Soviet Russian government to establish a committee to determine the boundary line to avoid such disputes. (Domei dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo—Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Ota, officially proposed to the Soviet government on the 14th the establishment of a joint Japanese-Manchurian-Soviet investigation committee regarding the handling of the aftermath of the Jinchan Gou incident. Regarding the establishment of this committee, the Soviet government has agreed in principle, but the problem is that the Soviet side is requesting the participation of people from a third country. The Japanese government has rejected this request, but still considers the establishment of the committee to be of primary importance, and has instructed Ambassador Ota accordingly, deciding on an attitude to resolve the Jinchan Gou incident. As for the 180 soldiers who fled into Soviet territory during the mutiny in Mishan, they are the ones who ignited the Jinchan Gou incident. Therefore, they should be extradited to "Manchukuo" as criminals. Japan believes that this should be done in conjunction with the Jinchan Gou incident. Therefore, a serious demand has been made to the Soviet government regarding the extradition of the aforementioned "Manchukuo" deserters. (Domei dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Washington—The new neutrality bill proposed by the government, which proposes to extend the current neutrality law's validity to May 1 of next year, has been approved by the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate. The House of Representatives recently passed it by a vote of 353 to 27 and has sent it to the Senate for discussion. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington—Because the current neutrality law is about to expire this month, the U.S. government is urging the House to decide on a course of action. It is expected that the House will begin discussing it today. Some advocate for a lengthy discussion of the permanent neutrality bill reported by the House Foreign Affairs Committee last week, in order to resolve the issue once and for all. According to this bill, detailed provisions are made to entrust the President to fully comply with the execution, not allowing him discretionary power. Therefore, for the time being, it is better to extend the existing neutrality law to May 1, 1937. At the same time, the Senate Appropriations Committee will today consider the Army Department budget passed by the House last week, and the House Naval Appropriations Subcommittee will also consider the Naval Department's proposed budget of US$549,299. However, it is generally expected that the neutrality issue will be resolved first before the issue of national defense is addressed. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington—The $17.5 million U.S. naval auxiliary vessel construction bill was returned to the House Naval Affairs Committee today by Chairman Vincent of the committee so that the provisions could be redrafted to stipulate a 6% cost difference between private shipyards on the Pacific coast and public and private shipyards on the Atlantic coast. Shipyards on the Pacific coast would therefore receive preferential treatment and be able to bid on the construction of these auxiliary vessels. Under the current circumstances, the entire shipbuilding project would be contracted to shipyards on the Atlantic coast because their costs are lower. Rear Admiral Land stated to the committee today that the current naval auxiliary vessel program is sluggish. The Navy is currently testing new types of battleships. Some battleships are only dreams, but some have definite advantages. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>London—Member of Parliament and Chairman of the London City Council, Morrison, recently gave a speech in Bettrand City, discussing the issue of oil sanctions. He stated that those who oppose this proposal have no sufficient reasons to justify their position. In fact, if the League of Nations can resolutely take the lead and impose an oil embargo on Italy, then U.S. President Roosevelt and his government will follow the League of Nations' lead and cooperate with European countries.

<p>London—It has been learned here today that France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Romania, Spain, and Czechoslovakia will also send notes to Italy, with content generally similar to that issued by the UK yesterday. The Foreign Office today sent a copy of the reply to Italy's protest to the League of Nations Secretariat, thereby ending the negotiations caused by Italy's protest against the UK's consultation with Mediterranean countries on naval mutual assistance issues. It also requested the League of Nations to notify the 50 governments participating in sanctions against Italy of the UK memorandum, i.e., the claim that delayed sanctions are useless.

<p>London—The cabinet met today and has drafted a £300 million rearmament plan. The National Defense Subcommittee has already held twelve meetings this month, and today's cabinet meeting approved the plan. The needs of British national defense were reportedly discussed at the cabinet meeting, including: 1) allocating the funds to cover the expenses of various national defense departments over the next three years; 2) methods of raising funds, whether through the issuance of treasury bills or public bonds; 3) adjusting the plan for Imperial defense. In the future, a committee may be formed, consisting of Minister without Portfolio Sir Thomas Inskip together with personnel from the general staff of the army, navy, and air force; 4) proposing to re-establish a munitions department or other agency to prepare for industrial mobilization; 5) issuing a white paper in mid-March explaining the reasons for Britain's rearmament. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>London—The Cabinet held a meeting today and reportedly considered establishing two committees, both named the National Defense Coordination Committee, one responsible for national defense matters within the UK and the other responsible for the defense of overseas dominions and territories. This plan to reorganize national defense was proposed by the Cabinet's National Defense Committee and has been thoroughly discussed by the Cabinet. It is reported that it will take four or five years to complete. However, the government, recognizing the need for a great effort in the industrial sector for rearmament, does not want to delay the process for too long and will try to shorten the deadline as much as possible. It is generally believed that the capacity of British aircraft factories should also be expanded to build the necessary aircraft in accordance with the government's air force plan. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London—The Times recently reported that the government's rearmament plan requires funding of £230,000,000. The white paper on this plan will be published in early March, and the House of Commons will submit it for discussion on the 9th of next month. To alleviate unemployment, the government will allocate most of the work of the rearmament plan to regions with the highest unemployment rates. In addition, the government will solemnly declare that it will make every effort to improve the diplomatic situation, and once the international tension eases, it will gradually implement this plan.

<h3 id="e24">US Supreme Court Decision: Tennessee Valley Authority Act Does Not Violate the Constitution <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Washington – The Supreme Court today ruled that the Tennessee Valley Authority project is constitutional, and that the measures taken by the Tennessee Valley Authority, created under the act, are also valid. This is a major victory for the government, which had previously suffered setbacks in its political and economical plans with the Supreme Court's decisions against the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The court ruled that the government has the right to sell electricity from the Wilson Dam and expressed full support for selling electricity elsewhere in the river basin in the future. Only one of the nine judges dissented. Chief Justice Hughes read the judgment, stating that the federal government, under the constitution, has the right to: construct sluice gates at the Wilson Dam to facilitate navigation; sell electricity generated by these sluice gates; and lay electrical cables to transport electricity to a "substantial market." This ruling clearly permits the federal government to construct similar hydroelectric dams on other rivers, but it does not clarify whether the government has the right to invest in laying electrical lines in rural or urban areas, as this issue was not mentioned in the appeal. However, the government does have such plans. The appellant in this case was a preferred shareholder of the Alabama Power Company, which had previously monopolized the electrical business in Alabama. The Tennessee Valley Authority loaned money to electrical companies in various towns, allowing them to set up their own lines. The company's common stockholders then sold the company's electrical lines to the Authority. At that time, the preferred shareholders came forward to object. After litigation, the current judgment was reached. However, there may still be disputes regarding other issues related to the Tennessee Valley Authority Act in the future.

<p>Paris – The chief French representative to the naval conference, Ambassador to the UK Corbin, recently returned to France to report to the government on the situation at the conference, especially regarding the issue of battleship tonnage. Naval Minister Piétri has convened a special meeting to discuss the matter. In addition to Corbin, those attending the meeting include Naval Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Darlan, naval conference representative Colonel Trousseau, and Assistant Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry, Massigli. Government officials believe that the details of the meeting should not be disclosed at this time, and have declined to issue a statement. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>London – The chief French representative to the naval conference, Corbin, and the Italian representative, Rear Admiral Piaccia, recently returned to their respective countries to report to their governments on the situation at the conference. According to sources here, Corbin and Piaccia submitted a compromise proposal from the UK regarding the issue of battleship tonnage to their respective governments for review. The proposal suggests allowing the UK and the US to temporarily build a certain number of 35,000-ton battleships, with the tonnage to be reduced later. Conference officials believe that this proposal will be acceptable to France and Italy. In addition to the compromise proposal mentioned above, Corbin and Piaccia also submitted a draft protocol to their governments for review. This protocol addresses the issue of exchanging information between naval powers after the establishment of a future naval agreement. It also proposes that the signatory countries authorize the UK to submit the future agreement to other countries, so that those countries can sign and participate, or offer suggestions and consult with the UK on modifications. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>London – According to sources at the naval conference, the conference will announce a postponement within a few days. British naval experts believe that if the conference fails to establish a qualitative limitation agreement and immediately announces a postponement, the policies adopted by the various naval powers will depend on the shipbuilding programs of Germany and Japan. Japan's shipbuilding plans generally fall into one of the following two categories: building only extremely fast cruisers, equipped with the best military equipment and the strongest armor, so that in the event of war, when a foreign battle fleet with lower speed arrives in the Pacific, these cruisers can be used to cut off their rear lines; or building super battleships with a displacement of over 45,000 tons. If the latter occurs, the United States will not be willing to show weakness and will also build similar large ships. However, these types of warships would have difficulty passing through the Panama Canal. If Japan takes the second path, the United States may allocate huge sums to modify the canal, or use these large ships exclusively by the Pacific Fleet and not include them in the Atlantic Fleet. If that were to happen, the entire US naval strategy would be completely changed. As for Germany, if it also builds large warships, the Kiel Canal would be in the same position as the Panama Canal. However, the German fleet can still sail into the North Sea through the straits of the Baltic Sea, which is different from the US fleet. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">French Treasury Borrows from Britain to Establish Fund: Huge Sum of 40 Million Pounds; Largest International Loan Since 1931; British and French Banks Agree on Measures to Protect Exchange Rates <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>London – According to news today, Britain has agreed to lend 40 million pounds to the French Treasury. This is the largest international loan involving Britain since 1931. Several British banks are acting as lenders, while the British government and the Bank of England have no direct involvement. However, the Bank of France and the Bank of England have agreed on measures to protect foreign exchange rates from fluctuations. Since the British Exchange Equalisation Account is confirmed to not be involved in the loan transfer, Londoners are unaware of the nature of the measures taken to transfer such a large amount of foreign exchange without disturbing market equilibrium. In the event that the loan has not been fully repaid and France has abandoned the gold standard, how will British bankers be protected from exchange rate losses? This guarantee issue is currently highly confidential, and outsiders have no way of knowing the details. However, considering the low interest rate on this loan, it can be inferred that it is attached to guarantee conditions. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris – Negotiations between the French Treasury and a British banking syndicate regarding a loan to the French Treasury were successfully concluded in London this afternoon. The total amount of the loan is 40 million pounds, with an annual interest rate of 3%, and a term of nine months. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance issued a statement explaining the nature of the loan, stating that France does not need to issue treasury bills in London. The British Rothschild Brothers Bank will simply make 40 million pounds available for France's use. After every three months, France can repay part or all of the loan early. This type of loan is a common practice. The French Treasury has previously sought assistance from the British market, which is no different from the recent need for French capital to assist the British market. Looking back to mid-1935, more than 16,000,000,000 French francs flowed out of France, which inevitably affected the financial market, leading to tightening. In addition, the revenue from various direct taxes is low in the first six months of each year, and the need for funds is urgent, making it necessary to negotiate a short-term loan. Once the tax revenue is abundant in the second half of the year, the loan can be repaid, and so on. Financial figures also said that the annual interest rate of 3% for the loan can be considered low.

<p>Berlin – Last year, Germany loaned 200 million marks to Soviet Russia, with the funds to be used to purchase goods in Germany. That loan expired on March 31 of this year. The funds have now been exhausted, so Germany is willing to renew the loan agreement with Soviet Russia. However, Russia and France are currently engaged in loan negotiations, and the UK and the US are also willing to provide loans to Soviet Russia. Because Soviet Russia has something to rely on, it is making extravagant demands regarding the renewal of last year's loan agreement with Germany, causing great disappointment here.

However, in the selection of raw materials, each type is chosen for its suitability for a particular tobacco color and a specific dye is prepared to enhance its appearance. The selection of raw materials and the preparation process involve some trouble, as shown in the following procedures:</p>
<p>Step 1: Removing the Stems (commonly called "tearing the tobacco"). The branches and leaf veins of the tobacco leaves are completely removed by hand, leaving only the leaf blade. This work is mostly done by hired women and children. Wages are paid based on the amount of stems removed, about three or four copper coins per pound.</p>
<p>Step 2: Selecting the Leaves (commonly called "sorting the leaves"). Leaves with blemishes and wilted or yellowed parts are picked out, and the leaves are graded according to their quality. Leaves with green color and thick texture are considered superior; those that are not well-selected are of the next grade; and those with dark color and mildew are of the lowest grade. When selecting, if the weather is clear and the tobacco leaves are dry, some boiled water must be sprayed on them to soften the leaves before they are turned, so as not to break them too much.</p>
<p>Step 3: Blending Flavors Tobacco of the same variety has different flavors due to various factors such as climate, artificial fertilizers, and growing techniques. For example, Danshui tobacco has a light and fragrant taste; Xianshui tobacco has a plain and bland taste; Shudi tobacco has a sweet and mild taste; and Saidi tobacco has a strong and pungent taste. When collecting and transporting, they must be kept separate for temporary blending. (Spicy flavors are blended with sweet flavors, and bland flavors are blended with strong flavors.) Different workshops use different blends, resulting in different qualities of tobacco shreds. This skill depends entirely on the experience of the craftsmen, resulting in different outcomes.</p>
<p>Step 4: Preparing Colors Except for hemp strip tobacco, which is its natural color and does not require this procedure, green tobacco uses about two dou of gypsum powder, one jin and fourteen liang of purple flower, seven jin of sophora flower, one jin of alum, and one and a half jin of rock salt for every 450 jin of tobacco leaves. For cotton tobacco and yellow tobacco, the purple flower and sophora flower are reduced, and 30 jin of white salt, three and a half jin of turmeric, and three jin of scarlet are added. The above-listed pigments are first made into powder for color mixing.</p>
<p>Soup Method: Take a large wok, fill it with clear water, and first pour in the sophora flower, then heat it over a fire. Place a large urn next to it, which should be able to hold the total volume of water without overflowing. When the water in the wok has boiled three or four times, slowly pour the sophora flower water into the urn with a small wooden bucket or large ladle. At the same time, put the purple flower into the urn as you pour, stirring vigorously with a wooden stick. After all the purple flower has been added, add the alum and rock salt, continuing to stir. At this time, the water foams and boils, overflowing the urn. Put the previously prepared raw gypsum powder into a wooden frame, scoop water from the urn, pour it in while it is hot, and stir as you pour. The gypsum will turn into a green, sticky paste. The brightness and dullness of the color depend entirely on whether the mixture is appropriate. Knead the green paste into balls and place them on the roof or in an open area to dry in the sun. When they are half-dry, use a specially made upward-facing water board to crush them. After they are completely dry, grind them into a fine powder. Add a little sesame oil while grinding to make the color bright and not easily airborne. After grinding, sift it slowly with a fine bamboo sieve, resulting in an extremely fine powder, ready for use in the fifth step.</p>
<p>Step 5: Blending Colors Take the previously prepared tobacco leaves, first spray them with boiling water to soften them. Then take boiling sesame oil and spray it with a sprayer. Spray oil once for each layer of tobacco leaves that is sprinkled. After sieving the last layer, mix it evenly with a wooden rake and prepare for pressing.</p>
<p>Step 6: Pressing Place the already colored tobacco leaves in a rectangular wooden frame, about ten feet long and three to four feet wide. Place them in well, flatten them, cover them with a wooden board, and press them heavily with a specially made device for four to five hours. After pressing, cut them into three sections and stack them on top of each other. Place eight wooden beams underneath, two feet three inches long and three inches three minutes wide, and cover them with the same wooden beams. Tie them tightly with hemp rope to form a solid tobacco bundle.</p>
<p>Step 7: Shaving the Tobacco (commonly called "pushing the tobacco"). Place the previously pressed bundle upright, with two craftsmen per bundle. One person holds the scraper, and the other pulls from the front. The shaved shreds are collected by the person holding the scraper into a specially made small wooden box. The box is equipped with a live board and two axe-shaped wooden wedges. When the tobacco shreds are put in, the person pulling presses down, the live board tightens the wooden wedges, and the two ends are trimmed neatly and placed aside. The second batch of shaved shreds is collected into the second box. When the third batch of shavings falls, the first box can be opened and the finished tobacco blocks and tobacco bunches taken out. The tobacco shreds are then loaded in the same way as before, alternating in this way. The finished small squares are called tobacco bunches, and each bunch weighs two liang, four liang, or half a jin.</p>
<p>Step 8: Drying the Tobacco The newly made tobacco blocks still contain a small amount of moisture inside. If they are stacked layer upon layer, they are prone to mold and spoilage. Therefore, a bright and airy drying room must be set up in a spacious building, and shelves are installed for drying the tobacco. When the tobacco blocks are made, they are stacked on the shelves in a triangle shape, waiting to dry completely. Then they are collected and sold. Those that are shipped to other provinces are packed in boxes for transportation.</p>
<p>According to investigations, Gansu tobacco is sold as far as Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan; nearby provinces such as Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi naturally have Gansu tobacco sold there. Pisi tobacco is a famous product of Fujian, but its sales area is not as wide as Gansu tobacco. However, according to people in the Gansu tobacco industry, "Before 1926, when tobacco prices were high, each jin sold for four qian two or three fen of silver or even four qian seven or eight fen (equivalent to six or seven jiao in foreign currency). However, since 1926, the value has gradually declined, day by day. In the past two or three years, the leaves have only sold for a few qian of silver per jin (around two jiao)." The reason for this is that in recent years, tobacco merchants across the country have reduced labor and materials, resulting in poor manufacturing or even the adulteration of fake materials. As a result, sales have suddenly decreased, and the pursuit of profit has turned into loss. This can be considered deserved. Furthermore, the popularity of domestic cigarettes, with their elaborate packaging and production, is far beyond the reach of Gansu tobacco. This is another reason for the decline of the Gansu tobacco industry. Therefore, to save it, it is necessary to cultivate superior tobacco leaves and explore exquisite manufacturing methods.</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Last summer, the prefectures of Hubei Province suffered severe flooding. Most of the dikes and embankments along the Jiang and Xiang Rivers collapsed, causing tens of millions of yuan in losses to rural communities. Many people were displaced, and the disaster was unprecedented in its severity. In addition to ordering the disaster relief agencies to do their best to provide relief and comfort to the victims, the provincial government has also formulated and distributed work-relief measures to repair the breaches. These measures include providing subsidies for construction and recruiting disaster victims for work-relief programs in order to prevent flooding in the coming year. However, the provincial government received an order from President Chiang, stating that "There are numerous dikes and embankments in Hubei Province, and many have been flooded or have collapsed. Considering the local situation, the Central Government has allocated funds for work-relief based on estimated budgets. It is imperative to quickly plan and start construction to repair the breaches and complete the work within a time limit to avoid further disasters." The Hubei Provincial Government also stated that the labor service season for water conservancy should be undertaken by the counties based on their local conditions. Orders were issued to this effect. Given the importance of water conservancy and transportation in Hubei Province, the Provincial Government has instructed the Water Disaster Relief Association to allocate work-relief funds based on the disaster situation in each county. Repairing the dikes should be specifically designated, and orders should be given for prompt action. With regard to the dike projects in each county, the main dikes should be repaired by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, as well as the Jingjiang Dike, the East Jinghe Dike, the Wuhui Dike, the Hanyang East Dike, and the Xinfeng and Hancheng Sanhuan embankments. All other civil dikes, civil embankments, and other water conservancy projects should be the responsibility of the county governments. They should follow the various plans and methods of national labor service, levy labor in a timely manner, select key areas for urgent work, and complete the projects on schedule. The original technical affairs instructors should be replaced by personnel dispatched by each county to receive segmented guidance and supervision from the responsible engineering offices. Tools should be self-provided by the people, and no subsidies will be given. After construction begins, the provincial government will send personnel to inspect the progress at any time. In addition to reporting to the headquarters for inspection and ordering the Department of Construction to instruct the Provincial Highway Engineering Office to act accordingly, special orders are issued to the commissioners of each district and the county magistrates of each county to comply. The estimated engineering, area, width, thickness, and cost of each dike are described below.</p>
<p>Zhang Gong Dike</p>
<p>The city of Hankou borders the Jiang and Xiang Rivers and is located in a low-lying area. Every flood season, it is surrounded by water on all sides. The northwest side is close to East Lake, and every year it relies on the Zhang Gong Dike for protection. The Zhang Gong Dike starts from the Boxue Academy in the west and ends at Dijiao in the northeast, serving as the only barrier for Hankou. There were originally no flood control dikes along the Yangtze River from Dijiao to Lower Taikoo. It relied on the Pinghan Railway embankment to protect against river water. After the great flood of 1931, a new dike was built along the river, and the dike surface was paved with crushed stone. From Lower Taikoo and beyond, up to Dakou Alley to Qiaokou along the Xiang River, it is still the old city area with streets and markets and numerous buildings. Except for raising the street level once, there have been no special risks in recent years. From Qiaokou to Shuitang, a small dike is built along the river to connect with the Zhang Gong Dike. This is the circular flood control embankment for the city of Hankou. After the great flood of 1931, the highest water level at the Jianghan Customs water gauge was 53.6 feet (equivalent to 28.40 meters on the Wusong datum). The entire city was submerged. In 1935, the Jiang and Xiang Rivers rose simultaneously and rapidly. From July 4th to July 14th, within ten days, the river water level rose sharply from 3.93 feet to 5.13 feet (27.65 meters). On the Zhang Gong Dike side, due to the rapid flow of the Xiang River, the water level reached 5.60 feet (29.04 meters), exceeding the great flood water level of 1931 by 2.4 feet. Therefore, the situation was particularly critical. Although rescue efforts were made, no major disaster occurred, but the Zhang Gong Dike was in a state of distress. After this trial, many problems were discovered. The current state of the Zhang Gong Dike: Although the Zhang Gong Dike was raised to 29.14 feet (average) in 1931, it was not thickened. The inner slope is extremely steep, and the dike body is weak. Moreover, the inner side is mostly lake, and the soil quality is soft. In recent years, during flood prevention, soil has been taken from the inner base of the dike, resulting in an extremely hollow dike foot. Every flood season, the inside and outside are a vast expanse of water, and the dike body collapses in weak areas. This situation occurred mostly in the Jintan and Yintan areas last year, but suddenly appeared in Gusaoshu, with a tragic scene. The dike soil layers peeled off and subsided, and the dike surface collapsed. Most of the areas were concentrated on emergency rescue. Other similar dangerous situations are too numerous to mention. Therefore, to increase the consolidation of the Zhang Gong Dike and ensure the safety of the city of Hankou, the Zhang Gong Dike must be widened, and the inner slope must be flattened to a slope of 1:5. The water on the inner side of the dike should be filled from the dike foot to a distance of 20 to 50 meters, and sufficient foundation work should be applied to ensure safety. Hankou city's circular dike defense. Construction plan and design standards: estimated according to two different standards: (A) Estimated at a height of 30.6 meters, the cost is 2,137,398 yuan, of which 900,000 yuan can be covered by public bonds. (B) Estimated at a height of 30.000 meters, the cost is 1,819,179 yuan, of which 900,000 yuan can be covered by public bonds. As for the allocation, the estimated cost for type A is: 361,800 yuan for the earthwork project of Zhang Gong Dike, 141,500 yuan for the renovation of the gentle slope project, 192,500 yuan for the masonry gentle slope project, 88,380 yuan for the earthwork project from Dijiao to Fenjinlu, 23,805 yuan for the reconstruction of the revetment project, 63,566 yuan for raising the revetment project, 21,120 yuan for the masonry pebble landslide project, a total of 196,871 yuan, and 27,597 yuan for the steel-concrete flood wall project in Lower Taikoo. The estimated cost for type B is: 173,700 yuan for the earthwork of Zhang Gong Dike, 74,000 yuan for the renovation of the gentle slope, 88,380 yuan for the earthwork from Dijiao to Fenjinlu, 23,805 yuan for the reconstruction of the revetment, 63,566 yuan for raising the revetment, and 21,120 yuan for the masonry landslide. Furthermore, the Hankou Municipal Government sent a letter to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau regarding the design standards of the Zhang Gong Dike. The dike body from Dijiao via Gusaoshu to Shuitang is raised to 61 feet. The inner slope is 1:2.5 below 2 meters from the dike surface and 1:5 below that. The water 20 meters from the dike foot is uniformly filled. The section from Dijiao to the sleeper factory is widened and raised on the outside of the original dike. The original stone gentle slope is completely demolished and rebuilt. The dike height is raised to 58.5 feet, the dike surface is 8 meters wide, and the inner slope and water filling are the same as above. Subsequently, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau replied with a proposed change plan. The Zhang Gong Dike from Dijiao to Daijiashan dike surface is 6 meters wide, the dike height is 58 feet, and the inner slope is changed to 1:3. From Daijiashan to the water plant, the dike surface is 8 meters wide, the dike height is 58 feet, and the inner slope is 1:3. The dike height is changed to 57 feet from Fenjinlu to Dijiao. The earthwork is requested to be handled by the people's service. As for the cost of adding revetments and gentle slope projects, and the flood wall along the river and in the Lower Taikoo area of Special Zone 1 and 2, there are no methods for raising funds for repairs. The municipal government believes that the flood season is approaching, and the dike repair project cannot be delayed. Therefore, it sent technician Wang Hualu to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau for liaison. According to the technician at the municipal government, "The Jianghan Engineering Bureau has been instructed by the National Economic Commission to take overall charge of the heightening of the Fenjinlu Dijiao revetment and the flood wall project in Special Zone 1 and 2 and Lower Taikoo. However, the total budget for annual repairs in the province this year is only 2 million yuan, while the estimated cost of the projects to be repaired is more than 2.49 million yuan. After approving 2 million yuan, there is still a shortfall of more than 490,000 yuan, which has been submitted to the Economic Commission for supplementary allocation. However, the cost of the revetment and flood control has not been estimated. Whether these projects can be built in the future depends on the results of the engineering bidding and whether there are any remaining funds. The bureau has not yet decided to build the flood wall and revetment projects. However, before the water level rose last year, the municipal government had proposed to allocate 80,000 yuan for the Zhang Gong Dike repair project and asked the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to handle it. The bureau used only 80,000 yuan for the repair project, resulting in flood control expenditures of more than 470,000 yuan due to the continuous rise in water levels. The total cost of repairing the entire dike this year is more than 1.8 million yuan. The bureau decided to divide the work into front and rear. The bureau is responsible for repairing the rear dike from Dijiao via Daijiashan Gusaoshu to Shuitang, which requires more than 300,000 yuan, now reduced to 220,000 yuan. The front is from Dijiao along the river to Qiaokou, which is handled by the municipal government at a cost of more than 1.4 million yuan. However, due to limited funds, it was decided to postpone the section from Jianghan Customs to Jukou and start work on the more urgent revetment project from Special Zone 1 and 2 in Lower Taikoo and Fenjinlu to Dijiao, which requires only more than 170,000 yuan, plus more than 20,000 yuan for civil service expenses, totaling more than 190,000 yuan. However, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau suddenly refused to allocate this amount, making it impossible to proceed with the above projects."</p>
<p>Xiang River Remote Dike</p>
<p>After the great flood of 1931, many of the dikes along the upper and lower reaches of the Xiang River in Hubei Province were breached. Although they were repaired afterward, they were not all completely restored. In 1935, another major flood completely breached the dikes in Hubei Province, which urgently needed to be repaired. After the plan for repairing the Xiang River Remote Dike at three or four work sites was determined, an engineering office was established, with Xi Dejiong, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, concurrently serving as the Director. Commissioner Shi, County Magistrate Xiong, and others jointly summoned 80,000 workers from various Baojia to build the dikes in sections, with 50 people in each group. At present, most sections have started work, but the number of workers has not yet been fully recruited and is still being recruited. In addition, the Hubei Dike Fund Management Committee and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau borrowed 1 million yuan from five banks, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Provincial Bank of Hubei, to repair the Xiang River Remote Dike. The five banks promised to lend the full amount and immediately agreed on a draft, which will be signed and delivered soon. The contents are as follows: A guarantee is provided in the form of 1.5 million yuan face value of 1935 Flood Disaster Work-Relief Bonds and 400,000 yuan face value of Compilation and Dismissal Treasury Bonds. The interest rate is 9% per month. The principal will be repaid in full by the end of December of the 15th year (of the Republic). From April to September, 20,000 yuan will be repaid each month, and 300,000 yuan will be repaid in each of the months of October and November. 280,000 yuan will be repaid in December, matching the total amount of 1 million yuan. Interest will also be paid on schedule.</p>
<p>Tongren Dike</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Tongren Dike, which is related to the three provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, has always been repaired by the three provinces sharing the costs equally. After the great flood last year, although the dike did not collapse, there were many defects. After the three provincial governments sent personnel to jointly survey with the personnel of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau in December last year, it was believed that the amount of earthwork to be moved for this repair should be doubled compared with the previous time. Whether the required funds should be allocated by the National Economic Commission or shared equally by the three provinces should be requested by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to the Economic Commission for instructions. Recently, instructions were received from the Economic Commission, stating that the funds for plugging breaches and restoring dikes have already been fully allocated. The three provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui should still share the costs equally to comply with the original plan. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau immediately submitted the number of funds required for the Tongren Dike repair project to the Hubei Provincial Government for verification. The total length of the dike repair project is 3.6 kilometers, requiring 342,000 cubic meters of earthwork. At a unit price of 1.8 cents per cubic meter, including ramming work, the project requires 61,560 yuan. The three provinces should each share equally, with each being responsible for 20,520 yuan. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau also suggested that the Hubei Provincial Government could deduct the amount to be shared by Anhui Province from the 18,810 yuan of the Hubei Province's share of the Ma Hua Dike project funds, and request that the amount to be shared by Jiangxi Province be allocated in full to facilitate the organization of an engineering office to start construction. Upon receiving the report, the Hubei Provincial Government specifically consulted the Jiangxi and Anhui Provincial Governments to act accordingly and ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to organize a temporary engineering office and start construction immediately.</p>
<p>Ma Hua Dike</p>
<p>The provinces of Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hubei have been jointly constructing the Ma Hua Dike for months and re-demarcating the borders of the three provinces. Regarding the construction of the Ma Hua Dike, after the three provincial governments consulted with each other through letters and telegrams and sent personnel to jointly survey, it has now been decided that the Ma Hua Dike will be constructed by the three provinces sharing the funds. The Department of Construction of Anhui Province will be in charge of the restoration project. The Hubei Provincial Government received a telegram from the Anhui Provincial Government requesting that the allocated engineering funds be remitted immediately to facilitate the start of construction. After receiving the telegram, the Hubei Provincial Government ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to allocate funds from the Hubei Dike funds for remittance to Anhui for application. It has now been decided that the Ma Hua Dike project will be presided over by the Department of Construction of Anhui Province. As for the required engineering funds, Hubei will pay 56%, Anhui will pay 31%, and Jiangxi will pay 13%. After the engineering fees are determined, personnel will be sent to survey and estimate and formulate a plan. Anhui Province is currently inviting bids for handling, and construction will start in the near future. As for the Ma Hua Dike, which is not within its borders, Hubei Province bears more engineering fees than Jiangxi and Anhui, which is in accordance with previous practice, because if the Ma Hua Dike is in danger, Hubei Province will be most affected.

<p>The Wuyi Prison was previously overcrowded, so the county government and the local court jointly identified a site in Yangyuan to build a new prison to expand the internal workshops and improve the conditions. However, due to land price issues, it has not been realized to date. However, all the construction budget and handling process have been submitted to the Higher Court and forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review. According to information from the Ministry, the land price is too high, and the funds are insufficient. Now that the Wuxi New Prison has been built, long-term prisoners can be transferred to the new prison in that county. Therefore, the construction of the new prison in Jinting is not necessary and is ordered to be suspended. Weng Zushou, the warden of the detention center, stated that the first and second detention centers are located in two different places, making unified management impossible. In addition, the houses are dilapidated, making all administrative and security work very difficult.

<h3 id="e89">Yesterday Morning in the Yuawo Sand Waters: The Xin Jiangtian Steamer Collides with a Sailing Ship - The Sailing Ship, Fully Loaded with Oil Barrels, Sinks Immediately - All Twenty Men and Women on Board are Missing <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian Steamer, which was sailing from Ningbo to Shanghai yesterday morning, collided with a sailing ship near Yuawo Sand outside Wusong Estuary, sinking it. All the old and young men and women on board were reported missing. According to reporters, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Xin Jiangtian Steamer Passes Through Yuawo Sand</p>
<p>The Xin Jiangtian Steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company specializes in sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo. It was sailing from Ningbo to Shanghai yesterday morning. At about 4:40 AM, it approached Block House Bony (Yuawo Sand area). Because a cargo ship was anchored and moored on the left side of the steamer's route, the steamer had to steer to continue forward. Unexpectedly, at that time, a large sailing ship, fully loaded with oil barrels, was sailing in with its sails up. After the steamer noticed it, it quickly changed its direction and sounded its whistle to warn the sailing ship. However, at that time, the northeast wind was strong, and the sailing ship was difficult to control. As a result, the steamer and the sailing ship collided. The hull of the sailing ship was immediately cut off, causing seawater to rush in, and the sailing ship immediately sank.</p>
<p>Sailing Ship Destroyed, Impossible to Rescue</p>
<p>At the time of the accident, the Xin Jiangtian Steamer was on duty by the first mate Yu Tingyuan and the second mate Gong Daohai. The captain of the steamer, a Norwegian named T.H. Johnson, was about to go to the bridge to be on duty because the steamer was approaching Yuawo Sand outside the Wusong Estuary. When he heard the sound of the collision, he knew that an accident had occurred. He rushed up to observe and saw only a few oil barrels and the destroyed wooden ship floating in the white waves. He then lowered the sampan and tried to rescue the crew members. But all the sailors, old and young men and women, of the destroyed ship had disappeared. Rescuing for an hour had no effect, so he immediately steamed the steamer to Shanghai to report the incident to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>
<p>Captain Johnson Reports the Incident</p>
<p>Captain Johnson reported the accident to the Ship Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Customs and Port Authority. The following is a translation of the letter to the director of the Ship Section: Director of the Ship Section: At 5:00 AM this morning, my steamer was entering the port and sailing through Yuawo Sand when a huge collision sound suddenly occurred. I immediately rushed to the bridge to observe and discovered that it was a collision with a huge sailing ship. At that time, my steamer was sailing forward at full speed. I immediately ordered the rudder to be turned to the right to avoid colliding with another anchored ship. Afterward, I turned the ship around to search. At about 6:00 AM, I discovered the destroyed sailing ship about one mile east of Yuawo Sand. However, there were no people floating. The sailors and crew members of the ship may have been rescued by other passing ships, or they may have drowned. The first and second mates of my steamer were both on duty at the time. Johnson, Captain of the Xin Jiangtian Steamer, February 18.</p>
<p>First and Second Mates Report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau received the report of the Xin Jiangtian Steamer's accident yesterday. The original text reads: Respectfully submitted, at 4:45 AM this morning, my steamer was sailing from Ningbo to Shanghai and arrived at Block House Bony (near Yuawo Sand). The weather was dark, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and the northeast wind was extremely strong. We were driving carefully and proceeding forward. At that time, a cargo ship was anchored and moored slightly to the left of my steamer's route. Unexpectedly, a sailing ship appeared on the right side of my steamer's bow. I immediately changed the direction of the steamer and warned the sailing ship with the whistle and stopped the engine to avoid the sailing ship. But it was too late. The hull of the sailing ship was slightly grazed. Because the ship had a heavy load, it sank due to the water seeping into the ship. The sailing ship did not have running lights, and the equipment on board was inadequate. Although my steamer stopped the engine and searched, only a few oil barrels were seen floating on the surface of the water. There were no crew members seen, and there was nothing that could be done. Therefore, we had to enter the port and dock. I respectfully submit the details of the incident. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, Yu Tingyuan, First Mate. Gong Daohai, Second Mate. February 18. As for the sailing ship's side, there has been no report received by the bureau.</p>
<p>No Report from the Sailing Ship's Side</p>
<p>According to reporters, the Xin Jiangtian Steamer left Ningbo at about 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. On the Zhenhai Port surface, it ran aground. It escaped the danger after a violent drive and continued on its way to Shanghai. It was safe on the way. Only the rudder blade was slightly damaged. Unexpectedly, when it reached the Yuawo Sand outside the Wusong Estuary, the tragedy still occurred. Although the steamer was not damaged, the sinking of the sailing ship resulted in the loss of all the crew members on board, which is extremely unfortunate. Although the Maritime Affairs Bureau has received the report from the Xin Jiangtian Steamer, the sailing ship's side has not yet reported to the bureau, so it is very difficult to handle the matter. Yesterday, only the captain of the steamer, Johnson, was briefly questioned. It is said that there were as many as 20 men and women missing from the sailing ship.</p>

<p>Cai's Opinion</p>
<p>Cai Jinjun published an article entitled "The New Life Movement and Police Training," stating that the New Life Movement is the foundation of a new life for our Chinese nation. Its purpose is to transform the inherent virtues of our nation, such as propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, into rules of daily life for the people, and to promote inner construction through external training. This is a good medicine for the current environment and pathological state of our nation. Since Chairman Jiang proposed and implemented it, it has been the second anniversary.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>In the past two years, the whole country has followed suit, and there has been a rapid rise in momentum. Judging from the facts, both quality and quantity have achievements to be proud of. However, for further requirements, it is necessary to deeply penetrate this rule and virtue into the national consciousness and become a common practice, so that it will be done without being ordered, and there will be no fear of intermittent cessation. To achieve this requirement, police training is an urgent task. The position and responsibility of the police are directly related to the people. Not only in the passive aspect should they spare no effort to maintain social stability, but also in the active aspect should they use moral strength to transform social customs. If they can set an example and have the norms of a teacher and nanny, then the people will have something to emulate, and the effect will be obvious. Since the establishment of the New Life Movement Section in this bureau in April last year, the training of senior police officers has been the most important basic work in the first phase. It is planned to give all of them New Life Movement training, teach the New Life Movement outline and New Life Movement essentials, and explain the various matters for the police themselves to practice the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement Section sends personnel to each branch, station, and team to teach, and also formulates an implementation schedule for the New Life Movement training for senior police officers, which is advancing according to the schedule. The first phase of training has violated one-third of all senior police officers, and the remaining two-thirds will continue to be trained in the second phase, with the goal of completing the matter in the shortest possible time. However, the importance of the police promoting the New Life Movement has been mentioned above, and it seems that it is not enough to issue it as a decree and promulgate it throughout the country to provide universality and show unity. If the Ministry of Interior orders all police agencies across the country to list the promotion of the New Life Movement as one of the formal duties, and at the same time, the local New Life Movement Promotion Association closely liaises with the local police agencies, unifies the steps, and details the implementation plan, then the future of the New Life Movement should be able to make greater progress. My humble opinion is that the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Interior and those responsible for promoting the New Life Movement should discuss and decide, then it would be fortunate.</p>

<p>The city's Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, Money Industry Association, Banking Association, International Trade Association, Taxpaying Chinese Association, International Issues Research Association, University Federation, Pacific International Fruit Association, Catholic Action Association, Youth Association, and Global Chinese Student Association held a joint farewell tea party for Ambassadors Xu and Gu at the Hong Kong Road Banking Club at 5 pm yesterday. More than 100 guests and hosts attended. Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, chaired the meeting and delivered a farewell speech. Ambassadors Xu and Gu both gave replies. The guests and hosts chatted happily. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>In addition to Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying and Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, the representatives of the various groups who attended the farewell tea party yesterday included Xu Jiyin, Lin Kanghou, Huang Bodu, Xu Xinliu, Zai Yingbin, Dong Xianguang, Wu Yunzhai, Yu Qiaqing, Tang Zaifu, Xi Jimin, Guo Bingwen, Qian Xinzhi, Li Denghui, Li Zhaohuan, Luo Qinghua, Lu Yigeng, Zhou Zuomin, Miao Zhongxiu, Zou Bingwen, Chen Guangfu, Yang Yihui, Yu Zuoting, Lu Ganchen, Wang Chuntao, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Bohong, Wang Shouxian, Ding Huikang, Zhu Shaoping, Ou Zhaotang, Ke Zhenxin, Guo Zefan, and more than 100 others.</p>
<p>Delivering Farewell Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Guo Bingwen delivered a farewell speech, saying that today the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Local Association, Money Industry Association, Banking Association, International Trade Association, Taxpaying Chinese Association, International Issues Research Association, University Federation, Pacific International Society, Youth Association, Catholic Action Association, and Global Chinese Student Association and other 12 groups are jointly holding a farewell to Ambassadors Gu and Xu. It is a great honor for Ambassadors Gu and Xu to attend in their busy schedules. Everyone knows about the two gentlemen's academic experience and contributions to society and the country. There is no need for introduction. Moreover, everyone knows the moral qualifications of the two gentlemen and the spirit of responsible handling of affairs. Ambassador Xu's visit to Japan, we are very fortunate to adjust the relationship between China and Japan, will certainly work hard. Ambassador Gu's visit to France will further promote the friendship between China and France in the future. Therefore, the colleagues are sincerely bidding farewell to the two gentlemen's departure. Some people say that weak countries have no diplomacy. At the same time, the diplomatic staff also feel the difficulties and hardships of weak countries. In fact, weak countries do not have no diplomacy. I just hate that there is no certain diplomatic policy and no certain diplomatic method. Today, the two gentlemen's missions are very different from the past. We stand on the position of the people and hope to work hard for the future of the nation and the country.</p>
<p>Xu's Reply</p>
<p>Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying then stood up and gave a reply, saying, "Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful for the kindness of all my old friends today. The chairman's words about Shiying are even more praiseworthy, which I dare not accept. Shiying has been in Shanghai for more than ten years. He has been loved and guided and assisted by local officials and outsiders on weekdays. He is willing to solicit for charity, and he is enthusiastic and ambitious for many years as one day. Apart from private friendship, in terms of public friendship, he is really reluctant to part and reluctant to separate. Although Shiying is old, he is still a young junior in the diplomatic world. Today, Ambassador Gu and all of you here are advanced people. I hope to give guidance, and I hope that all parties will give advice at any time. However, Shiying's talent is limited, and he feels fearful to shoulder such a heavy responsibility. He only has the patriotism and sincerity to follow Confucius's instruction of not disgracing his mission and strive to do it in order to be worthy of the government and the people. Today, all of you here are social leaders and have a deep understanding and research on international politics and economics. Everything still depends on your instructions. A thousand miles of book, I hope you will be happy. I wish you all good health. Thank you all."</p>
<p>Gu's Reply</p>
<p>Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, just now the chairman gave a farewell speech, which was extremely encouraging and humbling. Today, the 12 groups held such a grand tea party to bid farewell to Ambassadors Xu and Weijun. In addition to gratitude, I am really reluctant to say goodbye to the kindness of all of you. Today, Ambassador Xu's mission to Japan is of great concern to all of you, and Weijun, who is going to Europe, is also very concerned. Ambassador Xu's difficulty is different from Weijun's. However, our diplomacy is based on the people. Today, all of you are the leaders of various groups. I hope you will contribute more guidance. At present, the friendly relations between China and France have reached a very good stage. The French have always been rich in artistic ideas. Although our country is very old, it also likes art very much. The French love peace, and we also love peace. Therefore, with the similarities in the national character of the two countries, we can further promote the friendship between the two countries, which will naturally become better and better. However, the 25th year of the Republic of China is not only very tense in the Far East, but also in Europe. After Weijun goes abroad, I hope that all of you present today will give more guidance. Then, the meeting broke up and talked freely until about 7 o'clock.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shanghai Municipal Police Department Intensifies Anti-Smoking Efforts: Roster Compilation Completed, Plans for Phased Reduction, Regular Inspections, and Severe Punishment for Relapsed Smokers <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, since the registration of opium smokers at the end of last December, subsequently received an order from Inspector-General Chiang, stipulating that the registration situation and detailed number of opium smokers be submitted for review within January of this year. Therefore, the Opium Smoker Registration Section of the department immediately began compiling a roster and conducting separate statistics. However, due to the excessive number of registered individuals, exceeding 37,000, and the need for detailed classification, it could not be completed immediately. The section then increased personnel to actively compile the opium smoker roster, which is now largely complete. In addition to the master roster, separate statistics are compiled for ordinary poor people regarding their age, origin, occupation, reasons for smoking, quantity smoked, years of smoking, registration date, deadline for cessation, etc., in extreme detail. After review and verification in the coming days, it will be submitted to the Anti-Smoking Inspector-General and published in a compiled form. Simultaneously, in accordance with this statistic, a phased reduction plan is being meticulously discussed.</p>
<p>Intensified Investigation: The department originally registered over 5,000 opium smokers who were unable to obtain permits and applied for rehabilitation. Subsequently, due to intensified investigation efforts, the number of opium smokers apprehended daily reached double digits, leading to overcrowding. The existing opium addiction treatment hospitals in various districts were insufficient to accommodate them. To alleviate the suffering of opium smokers and expedite addiction treatment, the department specifically increased beds in opium addiction treatment hospitals for offenders in both the southern and northern Shanghai areas, reaching a total of 1,080 beds, to accelerate treatment. As a result, the number of opium smokers undergoing treatment gradually decreased. Currently, over 5,000 individuals have been discharged after completing treatment, and the number awaiting treatment is small and will soon be completed, it is said.</p>
<p>Strict Enforcement Ordered: Anti-Smoking Inspector-General Chiang, in order to ensure that all</p>
<p>regions earnestly handle opium smoker registration without omissions, and to provide guidelines for reporting, previously telegraphed all provinces and municipalities to comply. The municipal government yesterday forwarded the order to the Public Security Bureau for implementation. An excerpt of the original telegram is as follows (omitted above): Investigations into registration in various provinces show that Jiangsu's performance is relatively superior. Although the total number of registered opium smokers in Jiangsu is nearly 200,000, the accuracy remains to be verified. The number of registered opium smokers reported by other provinces and municipalities is very small, and omissions are feared to be more difficult to avoid. Hereafter, the yearly cessation of smoking and the quantity of domestically produced raw materials purchased by border provinces should all use this national total of registered opium smokers as the standard. If the number reported by each province and municipality does not match the actual number, then the entire anti-smoking design will be affected. To ensure widespread and accurate registration, the concurrently serving Inspector-General convened the first standing committee meeting of the Anti-Smoking Commission to discuss practical solutions, and specifically established fourteen articles for reporting opium smokers to be implemented, urging compliance and strict enforcement. No further excuses for extension will be tolerated. After this reporting, if there are still oversights or omissions, they will be treated as dereliction of duty and dealt with accordingly (omitted below), etc.</p>
<p>Deadline for Permit Renewal: Since receiving the telegram from Inspector-General Chiang, in addition to planning to comply with the reporting methods to report opium smokers, the department decided to complete the renewal of official permits for registered opium smokers in this city and permits for opium smokers traveling to Shanghai from other regions within this month. Hereafter, opium smokers coming to Shanghai, regardless of the duration of their stay, should apply to the department for permit renewal at any time, and a public notice has been issued to that effect. Once the permit renewal procedures are completed, the department will begin preparing for random inspections to check whether each permit holder is earnestly quitting smoking and whether opium smokers who have quit are relapsing. At that time, those found not to have quit smoking within the deadline will be severely punished according to law. As for those found to have relapsed, first-time offenders will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to six months, second-time offenders will be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years, and third-time offenders will be executed by shooting to deter incorrigible individuals, it is said.</p>
<p>Extension of Registration: According to Shen Shi She, the Shanghai Special Trades Association previously requested the municipal government to petition the Chairman of the Military Commission and concurrently serving Anti-Smoking Inspector-General to extend the opium smoker registration period to ensure its widespread nature, as there were many omissions in opium smoker registration. This has now been approved by Chairman Chiang, who instructed the municipal government to instruct the Shanghai Special Trades Association to allow unregistered opium smokers to voluntarily apply for registration during the reporting period. The municipal government's instructions are recorded as follows: The municipal government instructs the Shanghai Special Trades Association, "According to the instructions from the Chairman of the Military Commission and concurrently serving Anti-Smoking Inspector-General, Order No. Jinzheng 65, which states, 'A case presented on December 16, 24th year, File No. 503, reporting that the Shanghai Special Trades Association reported special circumstances in the city and requested an extension of the opium smoker registration period, requesting review and instructions. The report is noted. It is stated that there are indeed over 100,000 opium smokers in the city. Currently, due to various special circumstances, the number of registered opium smokers is less than 30,000. It is requested that the registration period be extended to achieve widespread registration, etc.' While under review, a report from the municipal government on the number of registered opium smokers in the city lists only slightly over 30,000. Comparing the two reports, there are clearly many omissions. Now, registration reporting methods are being stipulated. During the reporting period, unregistered opium smokers are allowed to voluntarily apply for registration, reissue permits, and be exempt from punishment. They should wait for the dispatch of personnel to conduct joint reporting to ensure its widespread nature, ensuring that no opium smokers are omitted. This is of utmost importance. This order, etc., is received and should be complied with. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau, this order is issued for the association to be notified. This order."</p>
<h3 id="e99">Baoshan Opium Smokers' Self-Renewal Registration Closed Yesterday <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Number Exceeds Six Hundred... Provincial Government Committee Member Ning's Talk</p>
<p>The opium smokers' self-renewal registration closed yesterday. The reporter specifically visited the residence of Mr. Ning Bojin, the Provincial Government Committee Member, and received the following remarks: "Our county is small in land and population. The initial estimate for unlicensed opium smokers was only two to three hundred. However, as of yesterday, the number of registered individuals actually reached over six hundred, which was completely unexpected. Based on this estimate, the total number for all sixty-one counties in the province should exceed one hundred thousand. Therefore, this self-renewal registration is a major key to the province's strict anti-smoking efforts. Over the past week, thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of all parties in the Party and government, and under the supervision and leadership of County Magistrate Zhang and Section Chief Fang, most have been working tirelessly, without leisure. This spirit of loyal service for society, the Party, the country, and the nation is truly admirable and commendable. Moreover, the majority of opium smokers have realized the miscalculation of being mired in the black market for so long, resolutely breaking away from the sea of suffering, and actively renewing themselves, which is sufficient to prove that there are indeed many heroic individuals among opium smokers. Now that the final reporting period is approaching, it is hoped that they will redouble their initial intentions and continue their efforts to achieve the goal of "thoroughly eradicating without omission." This will not only be fortunate for the future of anti-smoking policies, but will also make a great contribution to the revival of the national state," he said.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai First Special District Federation of Associations sent another letter to the Chinese and Foreign Ratepayers Association yesterday, requesting that a serious protest be lodged with the Municipal Council Board of Directors regarding the telephone rate increase issue. The original letter states: "To whom it may concern, the Shanghai Telephone Company's disguised telephone rate increase plan will be implemented from March 1st. At a time when the market is extremely depressed and we are already finding it difficult to maintain, how can we bear further burdens? Although the Telephone Issue Committee and various public organizations have repeatedly argued on reasonable grounds, the company has refused to accept them, resulting in no outcome. With implementation imminent, without a final sacrifice, we will inevitably continue to suffer destruction. At the joint meeting of representatives from various districts convened by this association a few days ago, it was resolved to nominate five representatives, Li Ao Kui, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Jiufeng, Zhang Yizhai, Chen Youyun, etc., to negotiate with the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the concession, requesting that a taxpayer meeting be convened immediately, and to lodge a serious protest with the Municipal Council Board of Directors. We hereby record and convey this to your association, hoping that your association, representing the public opinion of taxpayers, will handle this matter promptly to comfort the public's hopes. Time is pressing, please take charge for the public's convenience."</p>
<p>Dispatching Representatives: Since the Shanghai Telephone Company announced that the new regulations would be implemented from March 1st, various groups in the city have risen up in opposition. The Special District Telephone Issue Committee has scheduled a joint meeting of all public organizations in the city for the 20th of this month to discuss the entire plan. In addition, the First Special District Federation of Associations, as a citizen group, attaches even greater importance to the rate increase plan. It has specifically nominated five committee members, Li Ao Kui, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Youyun, and Zhang Yizhai, at the recent fourth plenary session of representatives, to represent the association in negotiating with the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the concession, requesting that a taxpayer meeting be convened to determine the solution, and to lodge a protest with the Municipal Council Board of Directors. It is learned that the representatives are scheduled to gather at the association at 1:00 PM today to depart, and the Ratepayers Association has been notified yesterday to designate a responsible representative to receive them, it is said.</p>
<p>User Suggestions: The Federation of Associations received suggestions from telephone users forwarded by the Seventh District, Fifth District, 27th District, 12th District, and 30th District branches, requesting that they be forwarded to the Ministry of Communications to instruct the Postal Administration to organize a messenger service in each postal district, regardless of distance, charging a uniform fee of one cent, before the telephone rate increase issue is resolved. The District Telephone Issue Committee submitted this to the representative assembly of various groups to discuss solutions, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructs That Goods Received Books Should Have Stamps Affixed, Attendance Books Exempt <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to Hesheng Fuji Company yesterday regarding doubts about the use of stamps, stating, "To whom it may concern, we received your letter of the 17th of this month inquiring about the use of stamp tax. Our reply is as follows: There is a distinction between internal and external receipts. Account books are purely for internal audit purposes and have no direct relationship with external parties. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly explained this, so the affixing of stamps to account books is determined by whether they are related to business operations. Article 16, Item 11 of the Stamp Tax Law has long been stipulated. Stores rely on goods for business operations, and goods received books cannot be said to be unrelated to business operations and should be affixed with stamps according to law. An attendance book for employees, recording when they leave the store and when they return, has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and does not need to be affixed with stamps, it is said.</p>

It is now known that the bureau has decided to establish a livestock quarantine station in the central urban area and will invite bids for construction within this week. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Site Selected, Construction to Begin Immediately: To establish the livestock quarantine station, the bureau has purchased ten acres of land near Zhaba Road and Shuidao Road in the central urban area. It has been decided to invite bids for construction within days, and the project is expected to be completed in May this year. After the completion of the station, the livestock inspection team of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau will send imported and exported livestock found to have infectious diseases to the station for isolation to prevent transmission, instead of sending them to the Jiangwan Veterinary Disease Prevention and Control Institute.</p>

The architectural design of the station has been finalized and includes five main buildings: livestock sheds, dissection room, incinerator, isolation ward, and office. Livestock with suspected infectious diseases will be sent to the isolation ward upon arrival, and several veterinarians will be hired to specialize in treatment.

<p>Chen Cao Yanxiang, a woman residing at No. 3 Renqing Lane, Kunming Road, recently hired a lawyer with her four-year-old daughter Chen Xuechun to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing her husband Chen Wenzuo (residing at No. 770 Chengxue Lane, Tangshan Road) and her father-in-law Chen Yaosheng (residing at Huadong Tobacco Company, Tangshan Road) of abandonment. The court approved the case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng convened a hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court.

<p>Neck Has Rope Marks and Knife and Axe Wounds</p>
<p>Son Fled, Major Suspect</p>
<p>Chen Weizhong, a local resident of No. 9 Qingyun Road, Zhabei, was 62 years old and made a living by collecting rent in Ankang Lane,. Shanxi Road Chen's first wife had passed away, and he married a widow, Sheng, as his second wife ten years ago. At that time, Chen's first wife had given birth to a son named Yueyun, who is now 31 years old and has married and had a grandson named Yizhuang, who is now ten years old and attending a nearby elementary school. When Sheng married into the family, she brought two sons, both grown up, one named Maode, who works at the Fourth Section Fire Brigade, and one named Maokun, who is unemployed at home. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, after Chen Weizhong went out to collect rent, only Sheng and her son Maokun were left at home. Around 12:00 PM, Chen returned home and found his old wife had been killed under the bed in the downstairs side room, with rope marks on her neck and knife and axe wounds, covered in blood, a horrific sight. He called for family members, but no one responded, as Yueyun, Maode, and others had gone out to work, and Maokun was also nowhere to be found. Chen ran to report to the Xibinxing Road Police Station under whose jurisdiction the matter fell, which in turn reported to the North Station Branch. They went to the scene together and confirmed the facts. The room was also sprinkled with kerosene, emitting an unusual odor, suggesting that the murderer intended to kill her and then set fire to the body to destroy the evidence. In addition to reporting the information to the Supervisory Office of the Public Security Bureau, the branch ordered the local guarantor to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an inquest. Around 4:00 PM, Prosecutor Liu Shiqing, Clerk Jiang Shaoji, and others arrived at the scene. The inquest determined that the deceased, Chen Sheng, had indeed been killed by others before her death. In addition to issuing a certificate for burial, the husband of the deceased was instructed to prepare a coffin for burial first, and then wait for the arrest of the murderer for further investigation. It is also heard that the deceased's son, Maokun, is currently on the run, so he is a major suspect.</p>

<p>The "Collapsing Cart" Cooperative of this city, due to the Public Concession's decision to implement rubber wheels on July 1st, specially sent letters to fellow traders throughout the city to solicit opinions. The original text is as follows: "For notification purposes: The establishment of this cooperative was indeed due to the Public Concession's plan to implement additional taxes last summer. We fellow traders found it unbearable, and only by uniting and helping each other could we relieve the suffering. Therefore, on July 25th, we announced the establishment of this cooperative, exerting our utmost efforts. Fortunately, the authorities of the Concession understood, and the proposal for additional taxes was then dropped. After the birth of this cooperative, in order to thoroughly implement the spirit of mutual assistance, we again legally presented a request to the Party and government agencies for recordation. The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs both approved the recordation. This is the process of this cooperative, from struggling against additional taxes to becoming a formal legal entity. We previously heard that a small number of unscrupulous individuals, under false pretenses, intended to undermine the entire organization of fellow traders and seek personal gain. In addition to thoroughly investigating them according to law, we specially notify all fellow traders not to be deceived by them, to strengthen unity. Regarding the issue of the Concession authorities implementing new wheels from July 1st of this year, this cooperative has repeatedly communicated with the Public Concession. In order to gather opinions widely, we hereby solicit opinions from all fellow traders on the transformation of wheels. Please submit written reports to the cooperative as soon as possible for reference and to facilitate negotiations. The area of this cooperative is the administrative area of Shanghai (including Special District One, Special District Two, Nanshi, Zhabei, Wusong, Pudong, and other places). Previously, in order to investigate the exact number of vehicles in the area and to seek universal protection, we organized registration, which was very enthusiastic. However, the urban area is vast, and we are still afraid of omissions. In addition to publishing advertisements in the Shen Xin Bao, we hereby notify all to register with the cooperative before the end of April of this year, so that we can collect and report and promote business development. Otherwise, it will be considered as abandoning membership and unwilling to operate."</p>

<h3 id="e155">I. History <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The papermaking industry, since the Han Dynasty, has been one of the most important industries in our country. Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other provinces are all famous paper-producing areas, with Jiangxi province producing the most. The Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper of Jiangxi and Fujian, the Xuan paper of Anhui (mainly produced in Xuancheng), and the Pi paper of Yunnan and Guizhou are all quite famous. However, the manufacturing methods are simple, and the scale is not large, all being old-fashioned handicraft production. The output is small, and the paper is expensive, which is not suitable for cooling down. ( ) Since the social and cultural undertakings ( ). With .</p>
<p>In the thirty-second year, due to poor business conditions, there were only renovations of old factories and no establishment of new factories. After the European War, the situation changed slightly, and many paper mills sprang up in Shanghai. In the fourteenth year of the Republic, the Jiangnan Paper Company was organized. In the fifteenth year, Tianju was established. In the sixteenth year, Minsheng followed (reorganized into Minsheng Yuji in the nineteenth year of the Republic). Yuantai and Huanshan both established branches in the eighteenth year of the Republic. The Shanghai Paper Mill was established in the twenty-first year of the Republic, and the Meijin and Dachina factories were established in the twenty-third year of the Republic. The above-mentioned are only those established in this port. As for other ports, new-style paper mills also appeared at the same time, such as the Wu, Hua, and He factories established in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces after the European War. Currently, there are more , which are all examples. From the Shen Bao of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, it is recorded that there are a total of paper mills (including paper mills and paper users) in Shanghai, with only more than 300,000 yuan of capital and an annual output value of only more than 600,000 yuan. It is difficult to compete with foreign paper on all fronts. Therefore, there is still the unhealthy phenomenon of foreign paper flooding the domestic market, which needs to be rescued by the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e156">II. Import of Foreign Paper <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Foreign paper is a unified name, but there are actually distinctions between ordinary paper, cigarette paper, drawing paper, etc. At the same time, there are many countries importing, such as Sweden, Canada, Japan, the United States, etc., only those with larger amounts. According to statistics from the customs authorities, the import of foreign paper, according to its main categories, is listed as follows to get a glimpse: (Unit: Customs Gold)</p>
<p>Note: Ordinary paper is used for printing books and newspapers. The following table shows the position of each country in the foreign paper trade with China:</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Foreign Paper Imported to China by Country in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Republic of China (Unit: Customs )</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Foreign Paper Imported to China by Country in the Twenty-fourth Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>From the previous table, we can see that the largest importer of foreign paper is the United States, followed by Japan, and then Canada and Germany. What is particularly noteworthy is the sharp increase in the amount of Japanese paper imported to our country. According to the statistics of the Paper Manufacturers Association, the import of Japanese paper to central China, the Northeast, Hong Kong, and other places in the first half of last year alone totaled 80,386,000 pounds, an increase of more than 10 million pounds compared to the same period last year. The influx of foreign goods has depressed domestic sales, which is what the Chinese people are paying attention to.</p>
<p>As for the imported Chinese paper, the main place for promotion is Shanghai, which is the center of national industry and commerce and the center of the foreign paper market. For example, in the twenty-third year, the imported general paper (total) was 7,530,532 , of which 4,517,681 passed through Shanghai, accounting for about 45% of the total import amount. As for the market situation of foreign paper in this port, it will be discussed later. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e157">The Practice of the New Life Movement <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>The New Life Movement, since its advocacy by Chairman Chiang, has now been two years. It deeply meets the needs of the times and is especially an important plan for the revival of the nation. Therefore, it can form a trend and be followed by the whole country.</p>
<p>Looking back at the history of China in recent times, various movements have emerged one after another. However, their effect is either only seen in the advocacy of a few people with lofty ideals, and not followed by the general public; or there is only temporary excitement, and no lasting power. Only the New Life Movement is different from this! The New Life Movement is the driving force for promoting new policies, reviving the nation, and advancing all cultural construction in China. The basic points of the New Life Movement lie in the spirit of "Renew yourself day after day, and keep renewing yourself," and in the determination of "All things before are like yesterday's death, and all things from now on are like today's birth," to eliminate all the bad habits and decadent trends that are stagnant at the bottom of society; to eradicate all the decadent habits that are deeply rooted in people's hearts; and to cultivate a new lifestyle habit of being steadfast, upright, uncompromising, and striving upward; so that the lives of the people of the whole country can be increasingly rationalized, scientized, productivized, revolutionized, militarized, modernized, and artisticized.</p>
<p>Life is the general term for all activities of human life, the various behaviors of propagating life. If the whole country, from top to bottom, officials are hypocritical and corrupt, the people are scattered and numb, adults are corrupt and mediocre, young people are degenerate and dissolute; the rich are cumbersome and extravagant; the poor are humble and chaotic, then to try to rectify the discipline of the country, maintain social order, and liberate and revive the entire nation-state, would it not be a reversal of fortune? Therefore, transforming life is not only an important plan to save the decadent trends and revitalize people's hearts, but also the driving force to revive the nation, promote new policies, and build all culture.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Chairman Chiang, the Initiator of the New Movement <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Examining the past various movements of saving the country and transforming it, the reason why it is difficult to achieve results in the end, the key lies in being impractical and not considering the root. The relationship between the implementation of any system and social customs and people's habits is very close. China's past education, and even all politics, suffered from hypocrisy and did not seek practicality, resulting in ineffective laws, useless technology, and incompetent machines. The officials are the same, but the efficiency is different; the technology is the same, but the achievements are different; the machines are the same, but the functions are different. Therefore, any country, after reforming the old and establishing the new, must move it with wind and transform it with education, and then its politics can be governed. The work of changing customs and habits is more urgent than politics and education. The New Life Movement is admired by all nations, but today it still presents the image of the four virtues not being promoted and the discipline being abandoned. Even other countries openly use words like "unorganized" and "uncultured" as material for ridicule and abuse. This is not due to the ignorance of the Chinese nation, but due to the empty words and false pride of later generations, who cannot put it into practice.</p>
<p>Therefore, the essence of the boxing life movement lies in acting vigorously, not in empty words; the key to the success of the New Life Movement lies in the practice of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and not in propaganda in various forms.</p>
<p>Wang Yangming, a great Confucian of his generation, deeply knew the root of the diseases of our people, and therefore created the theory of the unity of knowledge and action. He said:</p>
<p>"Where knowledge is truly and firmly known, it is action; where action is clearly and keenly observed, it is knowledge;"</p>
<p>"There has never been knowledge without action; knowledge without action is merely not knowing;"</p>
<p>"The learning of sages is only one effort, knowledge and action cannot be divided into two things;"</p>
<p>"Knowledge is the beginning of action, and action is the completion of knowledge!"</p>
<p>Yan Yuan (Fei ), Li (Nu Gu) lived at the end of the Ming Dynasty; they both advocated the theory of vigorous action, in . Yan said:</p>
<p>"The people's learning, in the heart , the mouth talks. There are thousands of words , I don't know if the body does one thing as reality."</p>
<p>"Examine the reality of one end and one section, do not the whole body great use of ;"</p>
<p>"Cover only to practice kung fu, can not to language words on effort; the battle, famous Analects of Confucius; people recorded, is act."</p>
<p>" No , only in the word act , such as people's , but to force ."</p>
<p>That is to say, it is the central work of changing customs and habits, initiating people's hearts, and promoting the national destiny; it is also the basic movement that is extremely indispensable for the revival of the nation at present.</p>
<p>However, the promotion of this kind of movement depends on the self-consciousness and self-reliance of the people of the whole country, setting an example, so that they can promote themselves to others, popularize the whole country, form a trend of the times, and form the strength of the times. Our country was originally a country of etiquette and righteousness, and the teachings of the former sages and philosophers have long been .</p>
<p>His disciple Li , inherited his ambition; also said:</p>
<p>"The scriptures are the books for preparing the arts, so they are to teach practice, not to be read in vain." Today, on the second anniversary of the New Life Movement; I am honored to be asked to contribute a draft by the Association; I am ashamed to be unworthy, and I am a guide. I deeply worry that this basic movement to save the country and revive it will still follow the same path of empty words as in the past; because of its words, I would like to share my efforts. How will the achievements of the New Life Movement be in the future, and how will the fate of the Chinese nation be in the future, it only depends on how vigorously the people of the country will act in the future!</p>
<h3 id="e159">The New Life Movement and Saving the Country <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>The New Life Movement has been advocating for two years. In these two years, China's national crisis has become deeper and deeper. Today, our Chinese nation has really stepped onto the crossroads of survival and death. We can no longer dawdle and procrastinate. Today, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the New Life Movement, we must think about how the New Life Movement is related to saving the country and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>There are many people who look down on the New Life Movement. They think, "There is no magic formula for saving the country in it, and there will be no miracle of reviving the nation." Really? If it is really like this, then the New Life Movement is only a cause for times of peace, and it is really unnecessary now. Quite the opposite. The reason why we want to advocate the New Life Movement is because it has a great relationship with saving the country and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the social atmosphere now. What is the attitude of the general public towards life? Cowardice, selfishness, numbness, indifference, dissipation, decadence, laziness, contentment, fondness for petty cleverness, and using public office for private gain are all signs of national subjugation and decline. Previously, a Japanese ethnologist summarized the various bad qualities of the Chinese nation based on many old Chinese novels, saying that the Chinese nation was originally an inferior nation. Of course, he had his purpose in saying that, which made us very angry and unconvinced. However, when we think calmly, the descriptions in the novels are not sufficient to rely on; and there are indeed many things wrong with our people's customs and social atmosphere. We can still be very angry, we can only feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Now, our nation is about to step on the line of death. We must seek survival in death, strive for regeneration, and bear the heavy burden of relieving the national crisis and reviving the nation. This heavy burden cannot be shouldered by cowards, selfish people, numb people, or indifferent people. It cannot be shouldered by people who are dissipated, decadent, lazy, or content. It cannot be shouldered by people who use public office for private gain or who are fond of petty cleverness. Quite the opposite, these people are destined to be slaves to a conquered country and traitors. This kind of attitude towards life and social atmosphere is a great enemy to the future of relieving the national crisis and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>The New Life Movement is to fundamentally eliminate this atmosphere of national subjugation that permeates the entire nation. It is to make every Chinese person change their appearance, wash their hearts, and be reborn, to extricate themselves from the decadent view of life. Therefore, the new life that we seek is definitely not just the "basic common sense life of a civilized person" that some people have left; but has:</p>
<p>A view of life dedicated to the national revolution and dedicated to the revival of the nation.</p>
<p>A kind of pure, loyal, selfless spirit.</p>
<p>A kind of good character of knowing etiquette, righteousness, integrity, shame, responsibility, and discipline.</p>
<p>Etc., and living an orderly, clean, simple, frugal, hard-working life. Only people who live such a life can bear the responsibility of relieving the national crisis and reviving the nation; and only such a life is the new life we seek during our national crisis.</p>
<p>We examine the progress of the New Life Movement in the past two years and know that our journey is still very long; but our nation and environment urgently need us to make even greater efforts! Comrades! Strive!</p>
<h3 id="e160">The New Life Movement in Extraordinary Times <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gong</p>
<p>What is universally recognized in 1926?</p>
<p>Modern is complicated, not pure, now the world is a whole organic organization, not indifferent. Because the development of transportation has shortened the world's journey, and the progress of industry and commerce has increased the close chain of mankind, the war between one country and another often affects the interests of other countries, and is involved in the war. The past World War I and the recent Italian-Ethiopian War, in which Britain came forward to intervene, are all obvious examples for us. Therefore, although we are determined to be peaceful and do not want war, under certain circumstances, it is not allowed by affection. The world's situation is so urgent, and our country's environment is very dangerous. Imperialist wars are forced to go to war for colonies, or to go to war for survival, or to go to war for national salvation. Since it is a war of life and death, how should we deal with it prudently, so as to avoid the tragedy of the destruction of the country and the nation! Some people say: This is the responsibility that the government should bear. The purchase of military supplies, the design of transportation, the storage of food, and the liaison of diplomacy are all things that the government should do, and not things that the people can do. It is true that the various things mentioned above are the preparations that the government should have, but with only the above preparations, is there a guarantee of victory? Modern warfare does not only rely on the fighting on the battlefield, but the mutual struggle of the entire nation. The quality of the people is the standard for the victory or defeat of the war. What the government does is only planning and command, but the real strength is completely in each of our people. If we can really unify our thinking, be orderly in our steps, be uncompromising in the face of adversity, and be able to endure hardship, then 400 million people will be as one, and the strength of 400 million people can create a great force. With this great force, to deal with the current extraordinary situation, we will definitely be able to overcome ourselves by force. But how to cultivate this great power? Two years ago, Chairman Chiang advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, which had already revealed to us that if we can earnestly operate it, this is the only effective way to save the country. The New Life Movement is to promote "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and since the Opium War, our country has signed countless treaties that have humiliated the country, and the general public is still unaware. In the past four years, the explicit and implicit plunder of the imperialists has made people feel heartbroken! We talk about saving the country, but in reality we are still extravagant and lazy, which is against the word "shame" in the New Life Movement. In other words, we don't know "shame". Therefore, if we want to know "shame", we should practice a new life. Now all countries are striving to improve the race in order to cultivate excellent citizens, so in the innate aspect, they are all advocating eugenics, and in the acquired aspect, they are focusing on education. However, the critical situation in our country is imminent, and there is no time to wait, so we advocate the New Life Movement to assist the lack of education. Therefore, the New Life Movement is also a movement to improve the quality of the people."</p>
<p>However, the improvement of the quality of the people is by no means a work that can be accomplished overnight. At the same time, the so-called quality of the people does not refer to one aspect, but includes knowledge, skills, morality, and physical fitness. In this extraordinary period, the most important goal at present that needs to be practiced is "observing discipline" and "enduring hardship". Without discipline, there will be no strength; without enduring hardship, nothing can be accomplished. When two countries are at war, the frontline soldiers must obey military orders, endure hardship, and even the people in the rear must absolutely abide by the laws, and give the invading country an opportunity. In the outline of the New Life Movement, it says, "The New Life Movement is a revolution in the lives of all our people. With the simplest and most urgent methods, we eliminate the habits of our people that are incompatible with the times and the environment, and make them tend to a life that is suitable for the times and the environment. In other words, we seek to rationalize the lives of the people." Therefore, the new life, that is, a rational life, is a life that adapts to the times and the environment. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said that the Chinese people are a heap of loose sand. If we want the loose sand to be united, then we must all abide by discipline. China is a country with backward production and is in a semi-colonial position. If we want to save consumption and save the country, we must be able to endure hardship.</p>
<p>The promotion of the New Life has been going on for two years now. Although some effects have been achieved in these two years, on the whole , it has not been able to change the atmosphere of society, and most of the people have not abandoned the habits of extravagance and laziness, especially in terms of , they are still floating and young , with little .</p>

<p>Letters were sent to various teams inviting them to participate. Registration will begin immediately. Each team must pay a registration fee of five yuan and purchase twenty yuan worth of tickets.</p>
<p>The Western Young Men's Christian Association of Jing'an Temple Road in this city has always been very active in promoting sports. After the conclusion of this year's men's basketball league, it originally planned to continue to hold the women's basketball league. Later, due to the use of men's rules, few people participated. The association then decided to stop the event and immediately began to prepare for the 8th volleyball league, which opened last night. Because the Detelphon Yiling team and others initiated a resumption, and discussed the matter with Chinese and Western teams, the Women's Basketball Association sent a letter to the Xiqing Sports Committee requesting a reconsideration. Yesterday, Li Yuxian of the Xiqing Sports Department told reporters that the association has decided to resume holding this year's women's basketball league and will adopt women's rules. Each participating team must pay a registration fee of five yuan and a deposit of twenty yuan for the purchase of tickets. Letters have been sent to Chinese and Western teams inviting them to participate. Registration has now begun. It is hoped that all teams will join as soon as possible so that the competition can be launched as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Zhenru Defeats Donghua</p>
<p>Liangxi Beats Aurora</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held another Jiajia Group match yesterday between Zhenru and Donghua. In the first ten minutes, the teams were evenly matched. After that, Zhenru was able to play freely, and as a result, defeated Donghua 56 to 35. In the other B group match, Liangxi defeated Aurora 60 to 27.</p>
<p>Both the Zhenru and Donghua teams had players selected to attend the Yalin Pace representative. The other generals were also talented at the time, and their strengths were equal, so they were all cautious. Seeing Feng Nianhua's agility, Wang Nanzhen, who had been a forward, was reappointed as a defender to monitor Little Feng and allow Cai Yanxiong to take advantage of the situation. Zhenru's deployment was very effective.</p>
<p>Donghua used its usual lineup. It was difficult for Feng Nianhua to develop, and Lu Zhongen's defense was more than enough, but his offense was insufficient. Only Chen Xianglong was able to do anything. Because of his lack of experience, Lu Zhongyu often let the enemy disrupt the defense, so apart from creating an 8-8 tie in the first ten minutes, there was little opportunity to raise his head.</p>
<p>Before the game started, Yan Yunjin committed a foul, and Feng Nianhua scored three points. Zhenru's Cai, Kuang, and Yan attacked the basket four times, taking an 8-3 lead. Soon, Donghua's Sun and Chen scored points, creating an 8-8 tie. The spring colors were evenly divided. After that, the Zhenru players launched a major offensive, taking the lead. From then on, they continued to increase the score. Struggling until halftime, Zhenru was 33 and Donghua was 15.</p>
<p>After a short break, the competition resumed. Chen Xianglong took the opportunity to attack, scoring twice. Kuang Yao Ya returned the favor, without distinction. Then Chen Xianglong scored three three-pointers, and Sun Baoqing scored in the middle. This was closer, reaching 28 to 39. Then, Cai and Han frequently invaded Donghua. Sun and Chen defended left and right, but they were unable to prevent the attacks. As a result, the situation declined sharply. Holding on until time ran out, Zhenru won 56 to 35.</p>

<h3 id="e180">From the New Life Movement to the Great Learning <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shouyong</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang has been promoting the New Life Movement for two years, and recently he spoke about the Great Learning. Shouyong is a bookworm who is still making a living in old papers at the age of sixty-one. Recalling two years ago, he wrote an article on the basic concepts of the New Life Movement in Yunhua Bimonthly, recognizing the New Life Movement as a new life for humanity. Everyone thinks about protecting this new life, and everything that can harm our life is regarded as a pest. Success can be achieved, and fame can be established. I advise everyone to divide the restoration of rites, exemplifying righteousness, cultivating integrity, and knowing shame into four major parts to govern the inner self, and to use the outline, central theory, public purpose, etc. as the standards for implementation. I also advise everyone to pay extra attention to practice. Later, I heard Mr. Chiang advocate the Three Transformations in the New Life Movement, namely militarization, artification, and industrialization, and I felt that these three transformations were truly the only way to save the country and the people. Recently, I heard Mr. Chiang talk about the Great Learning, with tens of thousands of words, deeply penetrating people's minds. Shouyong once said that there are gains and losses in things, but there is no ancient or modern in the Way. Confucius said, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new." Zhu Xi said, "The old is what has been heard before, and the new is what is gained now." Mr. Chiang applies the ancient people's way of governing the country and pacifying the world to today, to the trend of the world, and expounds it without leaving anything out. He does not advocate hegemonic achievements but speaks of the kingly way. The kingly way lies in renewing the people. The three major principles of the Great Learning are to manifest illustrious virtue, to renovate the people, and to rest in the highest excellence. It also says, "Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was renewed." Zhu Xi said, "New means to get rid of the old." "If you can one day renovate yourself, let there be a daily renovation. Yea, let there be continuous renovation." Eliminate all kinds of old habits, and then a new life can be established. Therefore, the New Life Movement and the Great Learning are connected everywhere. The Great Learning says, "As a mother cares for her infant." If one sincerely seeks it, though one may not hit the mark, one will not be far from it. Caring for an infant is the most ordinary thing, why is it used as a metaphor? Because an infant is also seeking life. If life is stabilized, the infant will not cry. Everyone can do the New Life Movement, then everyone can stop crying. Therefore, recognize that the New Life Movement is a new life. Now, if you want to escape from death, you can only go this way. Walking this way is the way of the Golden Rule of the Great Learning, that is, the way of manifesting illustrious virtue, renovating the people, and resting in the highest excellence. I hope everyone will appreciate Mr. Chiang's painstaking efforts in promoting it and walk this ever-renewing road, never to stray onto the wrong path and lose the vivacity.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Meg felt that she had not done wrong to invite them to come when she heard it; because this child not only gave her a consolation, knowing that it was the voices of those children he loved most that were singing the last lullaby for John, but also in their faces, she saw the purity with which they had already felt the deepest emotion of virtue, and the impression given by the worthy being who was breathing his last before them would remain in their hearts for a long time and serve as a benefit. Little May's head was on her lap, Xiao Qiao was holding her hand, often watching her, his eyes quite like his father's, and some of his gestures seemed to be saying, "Don't worry, mother; I'm here"; and around her were reliable and lovable friends; so the patient, devout Meg let go of her heavy sorrow, and felt that her best help was to embrace the purpose of "life is for service" and do as her John had done.</p>
<p>That night, the moon was white and the wind was clear. The children of Plumfield were sitting on the steps as usual, and they naturally had to talk about the day's events.</p>
<p>Amy, who was always impatient, was the first to speak, "Uncle Fritz is the most understanding, Uncle Laurie is the happiest, but Uncle John is just the best; of all the people I've met, I only want to be like him."</p>
<p>"So do I. Didn't you hear what those people told old Papa today? I would be satisfied if someone could praise me like that after I died"; said Frank, regretting that he hadn't been able to appreciate Uncle John's goodness before.</p>
<p>"What did they say?" asked Jack, who was quite moved by the scenes he had seen today.</p>

<p>The gold market was calmer yesterday, with only 1.7 yuan fluctuation throughout the day. The demand from Chinese merchants and Sassoon's foreign exchange brokers weakened slightly mid-session, but major players covered their short positions, maintaining the price after the decline. The trend was sluggish. At the start of the morning, overseas silver markets showed a decline in London and stability in the US. After the closure of the "Big Foot" (major traders) trading floors, a very small number of Indian buyers reportedly bought at the listed prices. The forward silver price in Monte Video was unchanged, with premiums ranging from five haos higher to five haos lower. The London spot gold price was unchanged, and exchange rates uniformly contracted. The bank rates for China destinations were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged.

Pre-market trading opened at slightly weaker than 50 yuan, and Dadexing immediately sold, causing it to retreat to within 49 yuan. The morning opened with a lower price, fluctuating slightly after opening. However, due to the support of Mobil Oil and American exchange, the demand from buyers was still strong, causing it to rise once, but it did not break through the 50 yuan mark. Banks poured out offers, and sellers took advantage of the high prices to become active. Soon, the market weakened again. However, mid-session, the market was stabilized by bank quotations that did not change and banks swapping spot goods in multiple transactions. The announcement of the white silver equalization tax revealed no change. Sassoon's continued to sell foreign exchange, but the banks continued to support the price. Although there were sellers in the market, the major players periodically bought, keeping the market very stable. The afternoon market was even more sluggish. The fluctuations were minimal, with rises and falls of only one or two jiaos lasting for a very long time. Near the close, the Indian silver price was reported to be two annas higher, causing it to decline slightly, but the closing trend was still flat. The second Indian silver price was also unchanged. Swap rates were slightly lower yesterday due to major players providing premiums, with short sellers providing a premium of about 5 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below.

After the close, the market was calm. The afternoon market opened at 1148.6 yuan. Although Dafeng Heng sold to 8.5 yuan, Yuanmao Yong, Dadexing Chunyuan Yong, Qianyuan Yong, etc. purchased, rising to 8.9 yuan. Yuanmao Yong, Richang Tianfa, Tongtaichangfeng initially rose by two annas, retreating to 8.3 yuan. Lifeng Hengyu Dadexing Richang Dafayong slightly sold at high prices. The closing price was 1148.6 yuan. After the close, the market was flat. The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard silver premium of 1146.3 yuan, was about 2 yuan higher than the closing price, which was about 1 yuan less than the previous close. The account registration price for March was 1144 yuan, and for April, it was 1149 yuan. The morning supplement was 1144 yuan, and the afternoon supplement was the same. The red gold price was still equal to the silver premium at 1148.8 yuan. Spot market conditions were calm, with Tianjin goods priced at 7 yuan higher, and raw gold priced at 6 yuan higher, but there were no transactions. The swap rate gradually decreased due to major players Chunyuan Yong and Huixiang providing premiums. In the morning, Qianchangxiang and Dingtai each provided Chunyuan Yong with 21 contracts at 5.1 yuan. Dadexing provided Chunyuan Yong with 49 contracts at 5.05 yuan.

In summary, Dadexing Chunyuan Yong Futai Yong Fuxing Yong Lifeng Tongtaichang, etc. were on the buying side. Dingkang Dafayong advanced first and then exited. Richang Hengyu Shunli exited first and then entered. The day's market conditions were calm. The opening price in the morning was 1148.8 yuan, and the closing price was 1148.6 yuan.

<p>Still doing one round of transactions... Market prices fell several jiao to over three yuan, and the demobilization bond even fell to the limit... 20-year 20-period 96 closed exclusively. Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange temporarily notified all brokers that all previously released short positions must be delivered in spot goods before 12:00 noon, otherwise, they would be punished according to the exchange's business regulations. Therefore, brokers submitted spot goods in a very crowded manner, with a large number. The exchange authorities inspected and collected the goods, which could not be completed for a while, and was postponed until 4:30 PM before the auction began. The exchange announced that only one round of transactions would be conducted. All brokers who had no goods to deliver for their short positions would inevitably have to buy to close out in this one round, so trading was more active than the previous day. The rise and fall of market prices mostly followed the grade of the unified public bonds, with quite a lot of variation. The 18th period still could not be opened, and the supplementary was only a little over half a yuan. The demobilization bond fell sharply to the limit. The 20th period rose by 1.4 yuan due to the excessive drop the day before, and the 20th period also rose by 9 jiao. Afterwards, various market prices were still not suitable, and the short-term gold fell by a small amount of 3.1 yuan. The market price took the unified public bond price as a proportion. Except for several public bonds that were still not suitable, the rest were almost the same. However, the exchange's restrictions are great, and trading will become increasingly light. In the end, market prices mostly fell several jiao to 3.3 yuan, with a total transaction volume of 10,067,500 yuan. The situation of its rise and fall is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Tennessee Valley Authority Electrical Lawsuit Verdict, New York Stock Market Suffers Huge Shock</p>
<h3 id="e185">Initially Soared Ten Yuan, Then Fell Back Down <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Newli Foreign Firm Report: Yesterday (17th), the New York stock market experienced huge fluctuations, and trading was as active as it had not been since July 10-11, 1933, with 9 million shares. When Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court read out the verdict on the Tennessee Valley Authority electrical lawsuit, speculation wrongly predicted that the government would lose, and public utility stocks surged. The teleprinter market reached six minutes, and prices soared, with the largest increases reaching as much as ten yuan. Later, when it was heard that the government had won the lawsuit, the situation changed, and buyers contracted. The market appeared very chaotic, and speculators with insufficient reserves had to sell other stocks. Dozens of new highs also disappeared in a flash. However, low-priced automobile stocks and morning stocks continued to rise. Near the close, the situation stabilized slightly due to short covering. Small exchange stocks fell steadily, and the bond market was slightly lower. The full-day transaction volume was 4.72 million shares. The New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the recent situation felt particularly tired. As the delivery period approached, the warehouse yarn stock exceeded 26,000 bales, putting heavy pressure on the market. The market was weak and powerless, and forward contract dealers were still unwilling to let go. Spot yarn sales in the northern spring market were developing, and procurement was particularly diligent. Spot yarn fell near-term and rose long-term. The spot yarn market opened weak, unable to stop falling. The local conditions were poor, and securities took advantage of the fall. As the delivery period for the current month approached, sellers prepared to supply a large amount of spot goods, so the bear market in the near term became increasingly pronounced. Until the third close, the market turned downstream, and as a result, the June contract broke the two-yuan mark. Each month fell by 4, 5, and 6 jiao compared to the previous day's close. The market continued to be weak after the afternoon opening. After the second session, it was heard that third-grade cotton yarn had rebounded by several jiao. Spot goods from Tianjin were particularly strong, and sentiment turned up again. As a result, the current month fell by 2 jiao compared to the morning close, and the long term rose by 1.4, 7, and 8 jiao. A total of 350 bales of Jifeng, 350 bales of Juxing, 1,000 bales of Hexing, 900 bales of Changyu, 2,050 bales of Dachangcheng, 1,350 bales of Changfeng, 450 bales of Tongfu, 500 bales of Taichang, 450 bales of Lanlian, and 550 bales of Yongda were sold. 3,650 bales of Dafu, 550 bales of Tongfu, 800 bales of Dafeng, 850 bales of Guangfeng, 700 bales of Shenji, 450 bales of Senkang, and 300 bales of Xie Xian were bought.

<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but the situation still did not break free from the consolidation pattern. However, the competition between the bulls and bears was extremely fierce. Market discussions indicated that around 40,000 dan of cotton that passed the inspection for this month's cotton rush were supplied as spot goods, putting heavy pressure on the market. The market weakened further. Rumors circulated in the afternoon that the bulls were preparing to take out mortgages, and the market became slightly firmer. Da Ji bought up the spot cotton. The spot cotton market opened, and the market sentiment was dull due to the fall of U.S. spot cotton and Indian cotton by 0.5 to 1 rupee, and the fall of Osaka third-grade cotton by 2.3 jiao. Moreover, the yarn market weakened further. Until the third close, the wind of decline swept through, with each month falling by 2.3 jiao. The May contract broke the two-yuan mark. As a result, the current month fell by 1 jiao compared to the previous day's close, and the others fell by 2 jiao to 3.5 jiao. After the afternoon opening, Da Ji suddenly started buying, and the market jumped up by 2.3 jiao. At the same time, Osaka third-grade cotton rebounded by 3.4 jiao, boosting morale. As a result, each month rose by 3.5 jiao to 4 jiao compared to the morning close, and the current month remained unchanged.

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with some limit orders to buy, and foreign firms and New Orleans bought, but there were few transactions. Each month rose by 2 to 4 points. The rise in new cotton was due to the progress in the Guitian method. Moreover, some people have taken delivery of the cotton recently sold by the National Cotton Association, so sellers are at a loss. There was a slight reaction in the afternoon, but it was absorbed by purchases from the trade and short sellers. New accounts were greatly reduced, and the trade was watching, with a relatively tight actual position. The closing was stable, with spot prices down 5 points and futures up 6 to 7 points. British spot cotton fell 3 points, and futures rose 2 points. Indian cotton was bought by retail investors and brokers, and speculators sold, with fair-faced and Aomula falling by 0.25 rupee, and Bai Xi falling by 0.25 to 0.5 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (17th telegram). According to the Mumbai telegram on the 18th, the opening forecast for Luo flower was 196.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupees from the previous day's close.

<p>The flour market was sluggish yesterday, and the situation was very light. Major bulls were mostly trying to withdraw their funds, especially in the near months, where the selling pressure was even greater. Opening prices immediately fell by several fen and several li. Spot flour sales in the north and south were weak. The near months were consistently weak, while the distant months were stable due to factory support.</p>

<p>The wheat market shrank by 2.3 jiao yesterday, with the spot market tight and foreign wheat expensive. Although the order was repeatedly rumored, it has not been confirmed. Market sentiment is hopeful, and the weather is unfavorable. Inland factories are also not selling, and covering shorts and new hoarding are of concern. Each month is gradually improving, especially the distant months. Spot wheat dealers are again shouting higher prices, but factories dislike them and there is still no formal market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, only 1,000+ bags of Yangtze River goods of Ke Yao arrived, while sales in the local market were still active. There were also inquiries from inland buyers about rough Ke Yao, and the market immediately turned stable. Inland buyers purchased 180 bags of Han rough and 288 bags of Han rough. 3,300 bags of Jiangxi rice, 820 bags of Hunan rice, and 100 bags each of Ankang and Taizhou were shipped from the local market. The arrivals and storage of rough rice have been high recently. Since Ke Yao stopped being imported, they have been stagnant for a long time. After yesterday's inland activity, the market price immediately rebounded by several fen. Other varieties were also stable.</p>

<p>Since foreign firms stopped, inland sales of bran have been weak. The bran stocks of various factories have gradually increased, and the market has also been weakening step by step. There were some inquiries from inland buyers in the past few days, but the number was very small, and they were only taking advantage of the weakness to make some arrangements. Yesterday's sales were less than 1,000 bags, with high-grade at 3.2 yuan and miscellaneous and Ke bran ranging from 3.15 yuan to 3.1 yuan.</p>

<p>The soybean market initially continued the previous day's momentum, with factories continuing to buy, and Suifeng frequently inquiring, and the market atmosphere was quite optimistic. However, the results were still reported to be falling by Da Yun, and sentiment turned down. The market softened in the afternoon. Yesterday, it was reported that 1,400 bags of Luohe beans, 400 bags of Luohe green beans, and one cart of Bengbu beans were shipped by the factory. Other Zha beans, Du beans, and Sha Huang sold for more than 1,500 bags and were shipped to the local, Panzhou, and Xiamen, etc., with prices still high and stable.</p>
<p>There was a rumor in the previous issue that Suifeng soybean oil was exported, but it was actually a mistake of 100-200 of Xiamen's installed (it was heard to be kerosene in boxes). However, this newspaper can report on the unique changes in the oil and bean cake market, and the separate interviews from the futures and spot markets may have slight differences. It's also occasional, but in general it's always not.</p>

<p>Sesame oil was sluggish last year due to sluggish sales, and the market was quite bleak. Since the spring, due to the impact of a sharp drop in raw materials, transactions have been even more sluggish. Huai'an goods were said to have opened at 21 yuan, with only 20-30 Dan traded. Yesterday, Shaoxing firms procured 400 tins of Bengbu goods, calculated at 100 jin per Sima kind, about 120 Dan. Because it has been stored for a long time, the aroma is inevitably inferior, so the price is also cheaper. Currently, there are still 10,000+ tins in stock locally, but since the production price cannot be calculated, the source will be scarce, and the market price will not easily fall too much for a while.</p>

<p>Assorted Longan, the market price of mid-range goods rose again by 2-3 yuan yesterday due to racking shortages of arrivals and inventory, with some sales. Because it belongs to sporadic small numbers, the market is even more fluctuating. However, the price of high-grade goods is relatively high due to the land price, and they cannot be completely eliminated for the time being, so they cannot be fully traded. Its heat must wait for the sales to become active before there is a chance of a ten thousand-fold increase.</p>

<p>To the ordinary, inexperienced person, white sugar and brown sugar, it must be that white sugar is sweeter than brown sugar; but the result is just the opposite. This is just like people with delicate faces are not necessarily talented and intelligent, and people with rough faces are not necessarily untalented and foolish. That's the same example. As the saying goes, "Clever face, stupid guts," this is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that a small cube of sugar on a sugar stall is sweet, but I know that when the sugar is cooked, if the sugar maker neglects a little, the heat is too strong, or the fire power is overdue, sorry! It will turn into a dark color, with sweetness and bitterness. Therefore, I feel that the heat of love between men and women should not be too high, just right, it's the most tasteful. On the contrary, it may be as bitter as burnt sugar!</p>

<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>This seems to be a common problem. Although schools above the secondary level have a Chinese class, students have no good feelings towards it; even if there are one or two "rare talents," they are at least generally considered "old-fashioned" and "senile." Therefore, self-proclaimed "modern youths," men and women students, the active ones, flip through the "History of Sunset Literature," and the passive ones still kick the soccer ball. Therefore, it is not surprising that Han Yu has become a person of the Qing Dynasty on the test papers!</p>
<p>The Chinese professor had better prepare one or two short stories before class, whether it is the palace history of Yang Guifei and Wu Zetian, or the story of Yue Fei returning to heaven at Fengbo Pavilion. In short, the top priority is to be "fascinating." Then the students can still look up and listen. If you go on stage to recite lecture notes or analyze the advantages of Bai Juyi's articles, then in most cases, within three minutes, a certain number of people will fall asleep, a certain number of people will read the supplement, and a certain number of people will write letters... and I don’t know if the teacher is sweating on his forehead. However, there are still people lying in the dormitory and humming Beijing tunes. However. The Chinese level of the students, as expected, must be great without a doubt. That's wrong again, some people write "varnish" under their parents' names, some write "bugaboo", and some can't write a note. The Chinese level is "a complete mess," accounting for 9.5 out of 10. So why don't they like Chinese? This, my cousin's reply is the most straightforward: "Look, none of those Chinese books are more beautiful than the original Western books!" Alas, I know it!</p>

<p>Dongshan and Xishan in Dongting face each other. In the 36,000 acres of vast Taihu Lake, although the distance is only 18 miles, the only thing that maintains traffic between the two mountains is a vegetable boat. The vegetable boat is the one that carries vegetables from Dongshan to Xishan every day for sale, and also gives people a ride. It travels back and forth twice a day, departing from the front of Dongshan Mountain in the morning and arriving at Zhenxia Jiangli, and returning from Zhenxia to Dongshan in the evening. However, when it comes, it is carrying a boatload of vegetables and a few villagers—the people of Dongshan all call each other villagers—but when it goes back, there are many empty baskets and a few vegetable sellers left.</p>
<p>Debin, the owner of that broken little boat at 9 o'clock, and his wife have spent more than 20 years relying on the vegetable boat. Although they are always exposed to the sun in Taihu Lake in summer, and drink the northwest wind in Taihu Lake in winter, regardless of wind, rain, cold or warmth, they tightly bind their two lives to that little boat to struggle in Taihu Lake, but life is still okay; and they bought a few acres of land and built three houses.</p>
<p>The fare for taking the vegetable boat is sixteen copper coins per person, and it is also sixteen copper coins for loading one dan of vegetables; on average, there are fifteen people and ten dan of vegetables on their boat, plus the return trip, so they can earn more than two yuan a day. But apart from the couple, their son is also very frugal.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Logically, they have more than two yuan of income every day, and the expenses will not reach one yuan, and they should have saved a lot of money. But it is said that although they built three houses and bought a few acres of land on the surface, they actually owed a lot of debt to others; the reason is very simple, because Debin likes to drink and gamble, and women like to eat and dress, so although they勉强积得点, it is actually extremely limited.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a small gasoline boat running between the east and west mountains of Dongting. Therefore, although the average villager felt a lot of convenience, Debin's vegetable boat still ran as usual, but business was very miserable!</p>
<h3 id="e207">Yan Zhenqing is a Native of Shandong <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Among Them</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this publication, Mr. Jiaoxin's article "Doubts About Notables from Various Provinces" stated that Yan Zhenqing was from Zhejiang, citing the "Tang Dynasty, Linyi native" entry in the Ciyuan dictionary as proof. I believe Mr. Jiaoxin is mistaken. As it concerns the native place of a distinguished predecessor, I am writing to correct it.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, there is no place called "Linyi" in Zhejiang. Linyi is in Shandong Province, and was called "Linyi" in ancient times. During the Qing Dynasty, it was renamed "Yizhou Prefecture," and it is now called "Linyi County." Those who have read the Analects of Confucius generally know the sentence: "Five or six adults wearing hats, six or seven children, bathing in the Yi River." Those who have studied geography also know that there is a river called the "Yi River" in Shandong, and Linyi is located beside this Yi River. (Of course, beside the Yi River there is also a county called "Yishui.") Linyi is located in southern Shandong, only about two hundred li from Donghai in Jiangsu Province. Most of the goods transported to Linyi are transferred from Haizhou in Jiangsu to boats on the Yi River. Because Linyi can transport foreign goods from Haizhou, it has become the commercial center of southern Shandong. There are two provincial middle schools there, one being "Linyi Middle School," and the other being a rural normal school. On the walls of the rural normal school, one can find traces of ancient inscriptions on broken stone fragments, some of which bear the calligraphy of Yan Zhenqing. According to the people of Linyi, it is Yan Zhenqing's hometown. Wang Xizhi also visited Linyi, but Wang Xizhi is not called a native of Linyi, Shandong. Furthermore, Yan Zhenqing is also called "Duke Lu of Yan," and "Lu" refers to Shandong. Therefore, I believe Mr. Jiaoxin is wrong to call Yan Zhenqing a native of Zhejiang.</p>
<h3 id="e208">West Lake in the Snow <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Jinke</p>
<p>Because I seemed to have grown tired of living in Shanghai, I went to Hangzhou. Is Hangzhou "Paradise"? Not necessarily. The concept of "Paradise" seems worth reconsidering now, doesn't it? However, I firmly believe that Hangzhou is a good place. The air in Hangzhou is different from the air in Shanghai. Naturally, the society in Hangzhou is also quieter than the society in Shanghai. People living in Shanghai always feel that they are living in a constant rush, constantly being made tense. In Hangzhou, everything feels very peaceful, and one can live very leisurely. Of course, West Lake and Hidden Tianzhu are also more lovable than the so-called "Bund of Ten Miles."</p>
<p>Several heavy snowfalls have adorned West Lake with even more beauty. "Searching for plum blossoms in the snow" is also a very poetic endeavor. So, my friend and I walked to Gushan (Solitary Hill). We didn't take a car because we wanted to leisurely appreciate the lake and mountains after the snowfall. This was my friend's excellent suggestion.</p>
<p>We walked slowly along the lake like we were taking a stroll. From the Sixth Workers' Corps to Broken Bridge, the "Remnant Snow on Broken Bridge" was already enough to admire. A new, very elegant little red building has been erected near the bridge, which is very cute. If a pair of poet spouses or two or three young and beautiful girls lived inside, the lake and mountains, if they had consciousness, would surely welcome their companions with great joy; it is a pity that such a good house, in such a good location, is actually an official "Tourist Bureau"! We walked to the lakeside of the Inner West Lake. The Su Causeway is like a jade belt tied around the waist of the West Lake. The myriad peaks, draped in white, were particularly touching. Looking around from the Bojuehui Bridge, the scenery was truly picturesque and breathtaking. The fragrance of the plum blossoms on Gushan had already reached the bridge to welcome us, so we had no choice but to abandon the snow scene and go to Gushan. Fanghe Pavilion was deserted, without a single tourist. The plum blossoms on Gushan were in full bloom, making me recall the famous lines "Sparse shadows slant across the clear, shallow water, faint fragrance drifts in the twilight moon." I imagine Lin Bu, Feng Xiaoqing, Su Xiaoxiao, and Su Manshu, all enjoying this beautiful scenery happily in the underworld, and congratulating themselves on being buried in this land? (At the same time, I thought of the two thousand white plum blossoms on Izusan in Atami, Japan.)</p>
<p>My friend was visiting for the first time. Every time we arrived at a scenic spot, he lingered, unwilling to leave. When we got to Gushan and saw so many plum blossoms, he was even more delighted. I originally wanted to pick two plum blossoms to take home and display in a vase on my desk, but my friend dissuaded me, so I didn't pick them. If everyone picked flowers, wouldn't later visitors have no flowers to see?</p>
<p>After descending Gushan, we lingered for a long time in front of the tomb of Yan Shu, the Venerable. The tragic fate of this talented poet is worthy of sympathy. Two years ago, at a banquet of the Southern Society, Mr. Liu Yazi gave me "The Complete Works of Yan Shu," from which I can imagine his literary talent and romantic charm. We then casually went to Yue Fei's Temple, where there were many tourists. I bought a copy of Yue Fei's handwritten "Man Jiang Hong" and "Chu Shi Biao," and also a print of the "Buddhist Scriptures Stored in the Leifeng Pagoda." It was already "dusk" when I got home.</p>
<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3 id="e209">Trip to Little Wang Mountain <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>I have long heard of the name Little Wang Mountain, and have repeatedly wanted to visit, but have had no opportunity, and only sighed in vain. On the Ren Day of the Bingzi year, I received an invitation from Mr. Li Yinzhai, the owner of the mountain, so I happily went. The day before, the famous Mr. Xu Ziqiu and his friend Mr. Li Jinzhang came to meet me, saying that we could first go to Mr. Li's residence in Liucun, stay overnight, and then plan a trip to Little Wang Mountain. I agreed, so I sent my son, and took a motorcar, changed to a sedan chair, and went with them. After twelve li, we arrived at Liucun. The place was extremely secluded, as if in another world. There was a mountain called Jade Screen Mountain, with jagged rocks, and bizarre lights and shadows, as if a jade screen was being unfolded. In the morning, we went to climb the mountain together. Because the mountain slope was steep, and the wind was particularly strong, we could not reach the summit, and hastily descended. After lunch, we set off for Little Wang Mountain, which was about five li away. When we arrived, the host had not yet arrived, so we drank tea and chatted while waiting. Soon, we heard the sound of dogs barking, and someone shouting, so we quickly went out to see. The host had arrived. Those who came with him were Madam Tang Guoli, the wife of Zhang Taiyan, and her sons Qi and Huizi Xinke; and our old friends Mr. Fan Yanqiao and Mr. Jin Shoumei also arrived later, all having just come from the city. After exchanging greetings, we chatted happily. After Mr. Yin Gong retired from his tired official life, he lived in seclusion in Wuzhong and never came out again, enjoying the mountains and rivers in the autumn osmanthus season. Later, he obtained Little Wang Mountain near Mount Qiong, and bought it. He buried his mother at the foot of the mountain, built a tomb and village, and then proceeded to manage the entire mountain, clearing weeds, planting fine trees, establishing schools, and building roads, diligently and tirelessly, until now. Compared to those who sell their souls in the pursuit of fame and fortune, how great is the difference between the worthy and the unworthy? After a short rest, we asked to tour the mountain. Mr. Yin Gong enthusiastically led the way. We climbed Xiaojingshou, where Mr. Taiyan wrote an inscription, made in the Great Seal script, which was carved on stone by a famous calligrapher, with an extremely ancient, simple, and elegant effect. Then we visited the Jifeng Cave, Chuiyu Guest, Cuiyun Peak, and Woshi Peak, and ascended Hushantang. Looking out, we could see only mountains, and our hearts and minds were broadened. So we took a group photo outside the hall to commemorate the occasion. The most unforgettable thing was the boundless pine forest, thousands upon thousands of trees, forming a magnificent sight, looking like a green sea. When the wind passed through, the sound was like the waves of the Xiang River. In the autumn of the Jiaxu year, the old poet Mr. Chen Shiyi came to visit, and praised it, saying: "This is a pine sea!" Mr. Yin Gong was pleased, and quickly asked Mr. Shi to write a wall inscription, which was carved on stone to record the event. There are many cliffs in the mountain, with inscriptions, poems, and couplets, all written by famous figures, which are extremely precious. Inscriptions such as Mr. Taiyan's "Little Longzhong," Qi Piaohu Guangsheng's "Stone Forest," Mr. Zhang Zhongren's "Mountain Colors, Lake Light, Pine Waves, and Snow Waves," and Mr. Li Xiehe's "Secluded and Beautiful Green," etc. Poems such as Mr. Zhang Daoyou's "Deep Green Forms a Sea, Mountain Walks Clear After Snow. The Year's End Wind is Strong, Come Here to Hear the Sound of Pines," Mr. Deng Xiaoke's "The Yin Side of the Mountain is Covered with Ten Thousand Pines, Lofty People and Wise Scholars Follow Each Other, How Majestic and Not Accepting the Title of Daifu," Mr. Zhang Puquan's "The Great King Divined a Residence on Little Wang Mountain, Wild Clothes and Sandals, Meaning Naturally Leisurely, Remotely Pointing at the Boundless Hatred of the Wu Palace, The Autumn Moon Over Lake Tai, a Single Sandbar," etc.; Couplets such as Mr. Yin Gong's self-written "Clouds Rise from Stone Mountains, Wind Enters the Pines Below and is Clear," Mr. Taiyan's "This Old Man Knows a Thousand and One Things, Mr. Shares the Concerns of Later Generations," etc.; it is impossible to record them all. After the tour, we went together to pay respects to Madam Taijun's tomb, bowing three times and retreating. After dinner, Yanqiao took out a booklet and wrote a travel poem, inviting all the fellow travelers to write inscriptions. Madam Zhang responded with a poem, saying: "Don't Refuse to Go Far to Explore the Scenery, Don't Complain About the Deep Mountains for Dwelling, In the Vast Pine Sea, There Should Be an Old Dragon Roaring." I also reluctantly responded with twenty characters, which are not worth saving. Then Mr. Yin Gong repeatedly urged us to write poems, saying they were for carving on the cliffs. Yanqiao and Madam Zhang each wrote a joint poem. Zhang Gongzi Qi, who was only twelve years old, wielded his brush and wrote the two characters "Qi An" in the ancient clerical script, with truly silver hooks and iron strokes; I humbly added the four characters "Zhen Song Shou Shi," which were merely scribbles. After the writing was completed, we joined Mr. Yin Gong and discussed world affairs, feeling overwhelmed with emotion. It was almost noon when we went to bed, and I seemed to still hear the angry waves of the pine sea in my dream. The next morning, when we were about to leave, Mr. Yin Gong insisted on keeping us, and we made a promise to meet again, and then parted.</p>

<p>Jia Duocai pondered for a moment and said with a smile, "That's fine too. Let the two of you go back and ask first. I'll assume a number for now. Whoever offers a fair price, we here will definitely add another thousand yuan to it. For example, if someone offers twelve thousand, and can't add any more, we'll offer thirteen thousand." Bei Hai shook his head and smiled, "Mr. Jia's method is a bit inappropriate. If I collude with someone else and set the price very high, would Mr. Jia still be able to add a thousand yuan in the same way?" Jia Duocai picked up his hand again, rubbed it around his ear a few times, smiled, and shook his head slightly, saying, "I think that wouldn't be the case, would it? For example, if you really set the price very high, beyond what is reasonable, do you think I would still be able to add a thousand yuan? If the people from your Prince's Mansion really intend to sell this piece of land and free up some money to use, they would naturally be willing to make the deal, and wouldn't raise the land price to an unmanageable level." Bei Hai smiled faintly and said, "That's not necessarily the case. It is said that property is not sold to the chief strategist." Jia Duocai picked up his wine glass, drank two mouthfuls in a row, then poured a full glass, raised it, and looked like he was about to drink but hadn't yet, smiling slightly, "That's certainly true. But there are people with strange temperaments, who insist on selling their property to the chief strategist. Why is that? It's for the sake of earning a few more dollars." After he finished speaking, he suddenly made his smile even bigger, shook his hand at Bei Hai, and said, "I'm not advising you to sell your property to the chief strategist. I'm saying that my temperament is just like that. Mr. Wang, if I have something that you are plotting, I would be willing to sell it to you, do you believe it or not?" After he said this, he widened his eyes and looked at Bei Hai. Bei Hai couldn't say what kind of stimulus he was receiving, he only felt a heat on his face, and even his eyelids were a little unable to lift. Jia Duocai then stopped talking to him, turned to Wang Shicheng and said with a smile, "This Mr. Wang, don't be suspicious. If a deal doesn't go through, there's still goodwill. Even if this land deal falls apart, we are still friends. When doing things in society, we can't always look at money, and we can't always look at business. Mr. Wang, if you ever need my help in the future, I will definitely still help. Come, Mr. Wang, I'll fill your glass." As he spoke, he picked up the wine pot and poured it into Wang Shicheng's glass, laughing, "Just drink, if you get drunk, just go lie down in my room." (405)</p>

<p>Vitamins are essential for our nutrition, second only to hormones. Therefore, we should consume them in appropriate quantities. Otherwise, we may suffer from vitamin deficiency diseases such as beriberi and rickets.</p>
<p>The following foods contain relatively large amounts of vitamins. We should eat several of them in combination every day.</p>
<p>Spinach, wheat, indigo, crane eggs, milk, cod liver oil, tomatoes, tuna, suckling pig, cheese, rice candy, adzuki beans, and the above several kinds. Some contain one type of vitamin, such as A, B, C, D, or E. Others contain several types. Therefore, it is advisable to eat them in a balanced combination.</p>

<p>(Report by Dr. Wang Shiying) Patient: Mr. Du Ruiting, age 30, merchant. Currently suffering severely from insomnia and nocturnal emission. During work hours, he experiences headaches and dizziness. His limbs are fatigued. When reading or working, he forgets things immediately. He has a poor appetite and suffers from constipation. According to his account, he mistakenly engaged in masturbation at the age of eighteen, continuing for two and a half years. Later, he realized its harm and stopped. He then discovered that he had nocturnal emissions three or four times a month. He ultimately thought it was not a major problem and did not seek treatment. Unexpectedly, he married at the age of twenty-seven. The newlyweds' emotions were very strong. After half a year, he began to feel mentally weak and uncomfortable. He was unable to assist in the management of the business as assistant manager of the company. Managing the business was extremely busy. Therefore, the combination of both factors accelerated the aforementioned symptoms. He was very frightened. He sought famous doctors and medicines, but to no avail. It was delayed repeatedly, and the condition continued to worsen. When he came to my clinic, he was already in very serious condition. After a detailed examination, I instructed him to purchase and take "Himetol's" Sperm-Strengthening Pills from Wing On Company, and to abstain from sexual desire and recuperate. After half a month, the nocturnal emissions were completely cured. In order to achieve complete success, I prescribed "Shengzhisu" to replenish his deficiencies. In total, it took one and a half months. Now, his appetite has greatly increased. He has recovered his health. He is full of energy at work.</p>

<p>— (Introduced by Dr. Ren Guoxiang)</p>
<p>Modern treatments for leukorrhea in women are extremely advanced. In our clinical practice, whenever we encounter patients with leukorrhea, we always use a medication called "Liaodailing", which consistently produces astonishing results. This agent is made using lactic acid bacteria through scientific methods. By utilizing its lactic acid-producing properties, it can transform the alkaline secretions in the vagina into acidic ones, allowing beneficial lactobacilli to thrive, eradicating various pathogens within the vagina, reducing inflammation, and alleviating symptoms such as itching, pain, moisture, and erosion in the vaginal area. Not only that, but it can also prevent the occurrence of puerperal fever during pregnancy, before and after childbirth, after miscarriage, and before and after menstruation if Liaodailing is used. Other conditions such as senile leukorrhea, excessive secretions after vaginitis, gonorrheal vaginitis, endometritis, cervicitis, and various other gynecological diseases can all be effectively treated with "Liaodailing" for self-treatment. Moreover, the method of use is simple, and everyone can use it themselves. Therefore, I am introducing this medication to inform patients so that they know how to treat themselves.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Guo Qizhang) I have wanted to quit smoking for a long time. I have always seen that those who attempt to quit experience a variety of illnesses during the cessation period. All kinds of diseases that were hidden in the body suddenly occur during this time of significant change in the body, such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, convulsions, joint pain, and mental exhaustion. As a result, people procrastinate and hesitate. Recently, due to the government's strict bans, I had no choice but to make a firm decision. I sought ways to quit smoking without any pain. Later, I was fortunate to have Dr. Yu Bofu instruct me to purchase Stanol's "Shengzhisu" from Taihe Pharmacy and take it according to the instructions. Sure enough, no illness occurred. I was in good spirits. Compared to others, the cessation period was also shortened by one-third. After quitting smoking, my body became stronger day by day. My blood and energy were vigorous. My spirit was refreshed. My muscles were full. My weight increased. And my appetite was far better than before.</p>

<p>(Report by Dr. Jia Zhizhong) Patient: Lu Shunou, age 37. When he came to my clinic last autumn, he looked like a 45-year-old. He claimed that he was born with a weak constitution and also engaged in masturbation, resulting in poor development even during puberty. Later, due to the heavy burden of his family and excessive workload, his mental and physical strength were exhausted, resulting in frequent fatigue, insomnia, forgetfulness, lower back pain, dizziness, tinnitus, palpitations, night sweats, and various other symptoms. He was extremely distressed. He took many tonics, but they were ineffective. (Omitted) After examining Lu Jun, I determined that the root of his illness was a lack of secretion in the gonads, which could not be treated with general endocrine preparations. I instructed him to purchase the gonadal endocrine preparation "Shengzhisu" from Wuzhou Pharmacy. After taking it, he immediately felt clear-headed and slept peacefully at night. Even when he was too tired, he did not feel tired at all. Not only did his muscles become strong and his spirit vigorous, but his development was also perfect, restoring him to his youthful state ten years ago.</p>

<p>(Report by Dr. Qiao Wenbin) Madam Yu was known in her hometown for her health and beauty when she was unmarried. After marriage, due to frequent childbirth and postpartum imbalance, her body was weakened, and she became thin and unhealthy. She suffered from irregular menstruation and persistent leukorrhea, abdominal pain, cold uterus, dizziness, lower back pain, blood deficiency, yellow complexion, fatigue, and insomnia. She procrastinated and concealed her condition, and did not seek treatment. Until last autumn, after seeing that Madam Liang Jinquan, who lived with her, had the same symptoms and was cured by my use of "Female Shengzhisu" and "Liaodailing" both internally and externally, she asked her to introduce her to my clinic for treatment. After examining her, I determined that the cause of her illness was the same. I instructed her to purchase the above two famous medicines from Huamei Pharmacy and use them internally and externally. After using them, the effects were remarkable. Not only were her menstruation and discharge regulated, and all symptoms disappeared, but her uterus was also warm and her body strong, restoring the youthful beauty of her maiden days. Her breasts and buttocks were high and full, fully displaying the inherent curves of a young woman.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Wu Shaoliang) When I was young, I was poisoned by lewdness. I was induced by bad friends and mistakenly engaged in the bad habit of masturbation. At first, I relied on my strength and did not care. But because of excessive waste, I became dizzy and had lower back pain. My body was tired and my spirit was weak. I began to know the harm and quit. But I already suffered from nocturnal emission. Whether I dreamed or not, vaguely, semen was already released. I woke up extremely frustrated. I took many tonics, but the medicine was not right for the disease. It had no effect. The frequency of nocturnal emission increased. Last month, a colleague introduced me to Dr. Zhan Nianhui's clinic for treatment. Dr. Zhan diagnosed that it was caused by relaxation of the vas deferens and lack of secretion in the gonads. It could not be treated with ordinary tonics or ordinary endocrine preparations. I followed his instructions and purchased the gonadal endocrine preparation "Shengzhisu" from Wing On Company to restore the gonads, and also took "Sperm-Strengthening Pills" with the words "Himetol's" on them to strengthen the seminal vesicles.

(Medical History) - Mr. Xi was harmed by masturbation and excessive sexual activity, resulting in gonad atrophy. He successively developed nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms. The disease changed in many ways. His vitality decreased. He had no hope of offspring. He was introduced by Mr. Lin Youqin to my clinic for treatment last spring. (Treatment) - In addition to performing the latest scientific surgical and electrical therapies, I instructed him to purchase "Shengzhisu" and "Himetol's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" from Huamei Pharmacy. Premature ejaculation and nocturnal emission were both treated. At the beginning of winter, Mr. Xi introduced his best friend to treat venereal disease. I saw that his muscles were strong and his spirit was sufficient. He was a completely different person. In the course of his words, I learned that he had happily obtained a son.

(Medical History) - Mr. Wen formerly lacked knowledge of health preservation. He was careless with his diet. He couldn't abandon masturbation, resulting in the above-mentioned symptoms. He smoked to keep warm, becoming addicted to poisoning. The pain could not be eliminated. The smoking addiction became even deeper. It was unbearable. He repeatedly failed to quit. All stopped due to the onset of pain. Last year, due to the government's strict ban on drugs, it could no longer be delayed. He began to visit my clinic for treatment in late autumn. (Treatment) - My prescription mainly used "Shengzhisu" to eliminate toxins and stop cravings, "Weitongling" to eliminate the root of his stomach disease, and "Jianweisu" to strengthen it. "Himetol's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" were used to treat his nocturnal emission. He had it filled at Sino-French Pharmacy. For about a month, the poison was removed, and the addiction was stopped.

<p>Kidney Atrophy and Premature Ejaculation Cured in a Month</p>
<p>Patient: Gao Keyuan, age 36, Ningbo native, merchant. (Chief Complaint) - Kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation. (Medical History) - Mr. Gao had three concubines. The wives and concubines were four generations. He was overly tired from interacting with them, which caused the reproductive glands to be destroyed, resulting in the above two symptoms. The wives and concubines ridiculed him. He had no hope of offspring. His body was weakening day by day. His spirit was in pain. He repeatedly sought ineffective treatments. He became thinner and more tired. He was introduced to my clinic for treatment last spring by his colleague Mr. Chai. (Current Symptoms) - Nervous breakdown. Yellow complexion and thin muscles. Afraid of moving, afraid of labor. Pessimistic and tired of the world. (Treatment) - I determined that Mr. Gao could not be effectively treated with ordinary endocrine preparations. I instructed him to purchase the gonadal endocrine preparation "Shengzhisu" from Wing On Company. After taking it, his reproductive glands prospered and became strong. The two symptoms were cured one after another. He recently came to my office for something. According to him, two of his wives have each given birth to a son.</p>
<p>Lax Seminal Vesicles and Frequent Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Patient: Jin Shuqiao, age 27, local native, clerk in an organization. (Chief Complaint) - Nocturnal emission. (Medical History) - Mr. Jin was born with a weak constitution and incomplete development. In addition, he masturbated too often, resulting in nocturnal emission. His body became thinner day by day. The number of times increased. He took many medicines, but they were not effective. Dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, forgetfulness, and mental fatigue all plagued him. He was extremely frustrated. He was introduced to my clinic for treatment last autumn by his colleague Mr. (Current Symptoms) - Lax seminal vesicles. The prostate gland has also formed swelling. Lower back pain. Heart palpitations and night sweats. (Treatment) - I instructed him to purchase "Shengzhisu" and "Himetol's Sperm-Strengthening Pills" from Sino-British Pharmacy. Each symptom gradually disappeared. His body quickly recovered its strength. He said that the two medicines were the saviors of youth venereal disease. He repeatedly expressed his thanks and left.</p>

<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the United States, who referred to Japan as an "international robber" last December, recently delivered an important speech in the Senate, fiercely criticizing Japan's China policy. He stated that Japan is now determined to destroy the Nine-Power Treaty, close the door to China, and that the United States should expand its naval and air forces to maintain the dignity of peace treaties.</p>
<p>Pittman's speech is a response to Japan's unlimited aggression against China. The current Far East issue has once again become a problem of conflict between the Open Door Policy and the East Asia hegemony. Japan wants to block China's door, while Britain and the United States insist on equal sharing of interests in China. The Nine-Power Treaty, signed in 1922 by Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and China, stipulated respect for China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and adherence to the principle of equal opportunity for the commercial interests of all countries. However, this treaty has been destroyed by Japan since the September 18th Incident, so Britain and the United States cannot sit idly by, and conflicts have repeatedly occurred with Japan. Pittman's attack on Japan is also due to this.</p>
<p>However, Pittman's stern words, although not without benefit to the critical Far East situation, are ultimately just empty words. Japan's destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty is already very obvious. Despite the statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities that "Japan's policy towards East Asia aims to establish peace and is by no means to break the Open Door Policy or to monopolize East Asia by force," and the response from Japanese newspapers that "Japan has never infringed upon China's sovereignty, nor does it have any intention of infringing upon it in the future," the occupation of territories, the plunder of the twenty-two counties in eastern Hebei, and the control of several provinces in North China—what is this if not East Asia? What is this if not infringement of sovereignty? This kind of ostrich-like sophistry only further exposes its wildness. However, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty can only express their protest with a few empty words regarding Japan's actions, and dare not take effective measures to stop it. This has allowed the unbridled ambition of the ambitious to disrupt peace in East Asia. Therefore, although the destroyer of the Nine-Power Treaty is Japan's military force, the failure of the relevant countries to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the treaty also contributes to this.</p>
<p>In fact, we are not saying this in the hope that various countries will exert effort for China in order to fight for their own interests. We are only pointing out the failure of various countries to comply with the obligations of the treaty. In order to maintain the survival of our country, we have our own responsibilities to fulfill. Pittman's speech, no matter how sternly spoken, is unlikely to awaken Japan from its delusions. British official circles observe most clearly, saying that Pittman's words "only express anti-Japanese sentiments, and it cannot be concluded that the United States will take strong action to stop Japan's outward expansion, which is out of line." Even Britain admits that "Britain itself has not found a way to resist Japan." Therefore, in order to seek China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, it still depends on the efforts of the Chinese people themselves.</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>It is already spring. The city is sensitive; perhaps one can see fashionable ladies wearing new spring clothes on the wide sidewalks. But, released from that severely cold small town, I still have lingering fears of the harsh weather. Since I came to this small town, there has been little communication. Are you wondering if I don't even have the time to write a letter? This is what the severe winter has given me. I had not even passed the fifteenth of December when I arrived in this town. Collecting accounts in the countryside is the easiest thing; they have already prepared the funds and are waiting for your bill to arrive. At the slowest, it wouldn't take more than a week. But when I had collected all the accounts and was preparing to leave, winter bared its fangs and exercised its authority: it was a heavy snowstorm. When you walk on the field bank and look back at the places you have walked, you can no longer find any trace. So, like a vagrant, I was confined to a small inn all day. The inn was so small, separated by the cheapest wooden boards, as if it were a birdcage. After the Dali steamer stopped running, there was no way to leave. It was difficult to find a newspaper, let alone buy some books to pass the time. I had no way to pass these days when I was so eager to return home. Lying in bed, the long sighs of the travelers in the next room made me think of my home even more—it was the end of December, and a family is not as easy to spend the New Year as a bachelor! My white-haired old mother, my young wife, my young children, they are all leaning on the door, waiting for my return. Perhaps they will go to the dock to welcome me when the ship arrives. How disappointed they must be!</p>
<p>The innkeeper is also a foreigner. He welcomes me, the customer who comes every year; we are very familiar. When he is free, he brings his water pipe to my room to chat. He can light one paper match after another and talk to you from afternoon to dusk. However, he doesn't tell jokes; he is used to saying things that make people angry. I hate him very much, but I have no reason to refuse him from coming to my room. I am so conflicted. I would prefer him to report to me that a steamer will depart tomorrow, so that even if he talks to me until dawn, I can excitedly carry my luggage and rush to the steamer dock, treading on the muddy snow, not looking like someone who hasn't slept all night. One evening, it was the day we sent off the Kitchen God in my hometown. At dinnertime, he still hadn't thought of leaving my room. I was about to use this as an excuse to send him away when the waiter brought a plate of fairly rich dishes to my room. The boss put down his water pipe, placed the plates of food in the center of the table, and said to me in that weak voice, "My wife specially made a few dishes, how about we drink a few cups of wine?" He was so hesitant, afraid that I would suddenly refuse him. But I thanked him very much. How much did every cell in my body need to be excited? I thanked him for doing something I couldn't think of—drinking a few cups of wine, even though my alcohol tolerance is very small. That day, of course, I was drunk. That day must have been the most enjoyable!</p>
<p>Here, I also want to tell you something. For so many days, like a defeated rooster, I was locked in a small room. Every day I hoped that the night would come early. It would be a pleasure to have a sound sleep! But the patrol team in this small town is very excellent. Four people in a group, three people in a team, holding a triangular flag with a red seal, before it gets dark, they come to inspect the travelers. The way they look, I simply can't think of an appropriate metaphor for a while. The one in the lead holds a traveler's circulation book, asking what is your last name, what is your name, where do you come from, where are you going, what are you doing. Sometimes they even inspect your luggage for no reason. Every day from four or five in the afternoon until dawn, you have to be interrogated more than ten times, and there is simply no time to sleep peacefully. Later, I opened the door to sleep. When they came in, I didn't wait for their interrogation and recited a clean record like memorizing a book. So I am even more grateful to my innkeeper. That day I was drunk, and I don't know how those things were inspected.</p>
<p>But none of those things are good people. During the day, I often see them in the empty rooms of the inn, forcing the waiter to call for flower girls, venting their bestial desires, and slipping away without spending a penny. At night, they put on a serious face under the triangular flag. It is said that they were specially transferred from the county town for winter defense. Think about it, how many people will be oppressed and insulted by them this winter?</p>
<p>There are so many things in this small town that make people unable to stand it. I escaped like a pardoned prisoner. I'll talk to you in detail when I have the opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Grandpa's Story <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Mei</p>
<p>In February, a terrifying whirlwind swept in from Tiger Head Mountain, three hundred miles away, dissipating the deathly air in the town and scattering all the worries in people's hearts! Grandpa usually got up early, and he was even more worried these years. Although he was an old man, he was as strong and robust as he was in his youth. It was still only dimly lit, there was no sun, and there was not a trace of cloudy rain. It was gray and gloomy, and the corners of the eaves were quietly blowing wind. Everyone was still asleep, but Grandpa's familiar cough sounded stuffy from the front wing room, and then the sound of getting up and opening the door was heard.</p>
<p>After clearing his throat for a while, he sat on a homemade short stool, his spirit very excited, holding his old, balding pipe in his mouth, smoking leisurely, but in his heart he was planning: labor, market prices, plowing cattle, and the food and use of a family of more than a dozen people..., so he sighed. From the age of six, he followed his father to collect pig and dog manure everywhere, until the age of fifty-five now, he had never felt himself old. He was strong and capable, using means like an old fox to deal with worldly affairs, but now, he could only sigh...</p>
<p>Like Grandpa, Uncle Qiaojiao, an old elder in the village, was also worried. He couldn't stand the wild, short-haired, bare-chested, civilized female students in the town. He couldn't stand the price of twelve yuan for a stone of rice. He couldn't stand the young people who liked to eat, were lazy, liked to do good things, and made trouble. In short, he couldn't stand everything in the current world, so he also felt old.</p>
<p>These two old elders had been friends for decades. Whenever there was something they couldn't figure out, Grandpa would often go to his house, and Uncle Qiaojiao would receive him. The two old men would laugh happily, as if they had suddenly become young again. And Uncle Qiaojiao would also often come to visit for ant-like trivial matters.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Grandpa wanted to save some money to buy a plowing cow, but he didn't have any money, so he went to Uncle Qiaojiao's house with a cane, just as Uncle Qiaojiao was also coming over because he wanted to import a coffin for himself. The two old men met on the road, so they went together to sit under the cypress tree on the ridge of the field. Grandpa lamented the plight of a farmer without plowing cattle, and Uncle Qiaojiao explained his decades of labor and toil like a horse. Could it be that he didn't even have a decent coffin? No! He had to save some money himself. Seeing that his unfilial son would never plan for him again, because the fifth grandson was about to be born. They sighed, reporting their plans to each other, from their daily salt, soy sauce, vinegar, all the way to how to save a few tubes of dry tobacco. Finally, they went home with their canes.</p>
<p>After dinner, Grandpa announced his new policy for managing the family. He hadn't been to the fields for several years. Now he also shouldered the hoe and went to the fields with his sons, so that he could plant more vegetables in the wheat field to sell in the town. Back home, he also walked around with a cane, scolding, to see who had wasted a match, to see who had wasted the kerosene in the oil lamp. So he turned red in the face, tapped his cane, and loudly said that food was difficult and that saving was important. In this way, he also placed a small wooden cabinet on his bedside, dug a small hole on it, locked the cabinet door, and told everyone in the family that they must save food and automatically donate copper coins. In this way, Grandpa quickly turned the copper coins into dimes, and then exchanged the dimes into bright silver dollars, wrapped them in paper, firmly placed them in his waistband, and went to town with Uncle Qiaojiao. There was a farmer's bank run by the government in the town, which was considered to have good credit within a hundred and fifty miles. Grandpa completed the transaction at the bank, deposited the money, carefully put the deposit book in his waistband, and returned home satisfied. That night, Grandpa first drank white wine, trembling with excitement, and told of a terrible and prosperous fortune that was about to come to our family, because we would soon have a fat plowing cow.</p>
<p>"At that time," Grandpa said emotionally, "you can proudly wave your whips, driving the village to the hillside. Everyone must be attracted out of the house by this unusual plowing cow, looking with surprised eyes, enviously asking: Whose is this decent plowing cow? And you, children, must loudly, without fear, answer: Our grandfather saved money to buy it! Then the viewers will carefully touch the cow's body, sighing, spreading the news throughout the town, even the district chief will hear about it..." Grandpa was excited and shed tears.</p>
<p>The next day, we were allowed to have a meat meal. But Grandpa's happy days didn't last long, and they were shattered! A terrifying whirlwind swept across the town, and it was rumored in the village that the farmer's bank was about to close. Uncle Qiaojiao's face turned green, panting, his cane tapping sharply on the stone threshold, bringing this ominous news. Grandpa was startled, dragged out the cane from the bedside, carefully opened the lock on the small wooden cabinet, took out the deposit book from the bank, and ran towards the town with Uncle Qiaojiao in large strides. The family was as silent as death, and black clouds covered all the small gaps. A terrible threat was slowly growing and swelling.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Grandpa came back with his cane, disheartened, hopeless, without saying a word, sitting on a low wooden stool, staring blankly in a daze. After thinking for a while, he sighed sadly, tremblingly ran into the room, took out the wooden cabinet containing the copper coins, and smashed it hard against the courtyard. The small wooden cabinet hit the stone with a loud bang and shattered, copper coins scattered all over the ground, but Grandpa stood there blankly, clenching his hands, biting his teeth. When everyone looked at him, those two old eyes had already dripped a few lines of tears.</p>

<p>— (Fool)</p>
<p>Yoshizawa returned to his country the other day and talked about the purpose of diplomacy towards China, which lies in the establishment of the "Three Principles." Now, we should start from the most important Japan-Manchukuo-China cooperation of the "Three Principles" to promote it. Tan Lao San said that our country was originally the Three Principles of the People, Five Races United in Harmony, but now it has become the Three Principles and Six Races United in Harmony, which is truly something that one could never have imagined.</p>
<p>Jin Tongyi, the former section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was detained by the court for falling in love with Liu Zhaofen, a female student from Soochow University, and plotting to harm his wife, Li. This matter caused a sensation in Nanjing last year. Now, Li has filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Second Special Zone Court, requesting to divorce Jin. Tan Lao San said that our people are originally suitable for polygamy, but now the law stipulates a one-husband-one-wife system, no wonder there are so many divorce cases.</p>

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>We finally settled down in a small shop. At that time, the western sky was weaving colorful brocade clouds, and the slick faces of every pedestrian on the street reflected that beautiful red light. My companion was washing his face, and said jokingly:</p>
<p>"If you boil this basin of washing water, you can get half a catty of salt."</p>
<p>This small shop has a small courtyard. Several guests are drinking large cups of tea there. We are all from the same hometown, and we are all going to Annam.</p>
<p>Since we are new guests, everyone is vying to ask about Tangshan, long and short. The first thing they ask about is Japan. An old foreigner asked me in his half-salty, half-sweet Chaozhou dialect;</p>
<p>"You are a scholar, do you think China will prosper or not? Do we have to wait for the true emperor to come out?"</p>
<p>"I say," another person interjected, he is a medicinal material merchant who often travels between Saigon and Shantou, "If China continues like this, it will definitely not prosper. Think about it, the situation is getting worse every year, and we don't have airplanes or warships, and..."</p>
<p>"Everything is destiny," my friend snatched and said, "If you don't believe it, Yue Fei wanted to save the Great Song Dynasty, but Qin Hui came along. The Great Song Dynasty was supposed to perish, isn't that destiny? Nothing is useful, nothing is useful!"</p>
<p>"If you say that, then we are destined to die. I don't believe it. We are China, the world's largest country in ancient and modern times. Everything you say is unfounded, I don't believe it. Do you agree, sir?" the old man said.</p>
<p>He looked at me. I was a little dazed and didn't know how to answer. They have been away from their hometown for too long, and years of life have given them nothing but pain and no spiritual food. Do you want to laugh at their ignorance? But they all have a passionate heart.</p>
<p>The sky is slowly darkening. A trace of cool breeze floats over the small courtyard from time to time. The stars in the southern country seem particularly bright, shining brightly, embedded in the azure sky. All kinds of strange insect sounds float around, and there also seems to be a hissing sound of snakes.</p>
<p>When I turned back from outside, my friend who believed in fate was already sound asleep, snoring loudly. In the small courtyard, the old fellow was still deeply absorbed in sucking on a long pipe. The other two people, one seemed to be dozing off, but one wanted to talk about the market conditions for batch water. One asked, and the other waited a long time before answering a sentence. Soon, both of them were sound asleep.</p>
<p>I was dozing off when suddenly someone tapped me on the shoulder. I woke up immediately. Under the faint moonlight, I saw that the old man was on my right. His expression was sincere and still serious.</p>
<p>"Our China should be stronger, but, sir, tell me, can we become strong?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer, staring blankly at the old man.</p>

<p>. His eyes were like they were on fire.</p>
<p>"I have suffered for half my life, all because China is too weak. I was owed money by an Annamese man in Saigon, but the court didn't let me win the case. I have a child at home who wants to come here to help me, but the New Guest Yamen wants him to pay more than two hundred dollars. Other countries don't have this, just because China is too weak." He paused, and then said, "I heard that we were fighting foreigners the year before last, and we needed to raise donations. I donated half of my money, but there is still no news of victory. Alas..." The old man sighed.</p>
<p>I remained silent, which aroused his suspicion of me. He opened his mouth wide and asked me in a surprised tone, "What? You don't understand what I'm saying? Or..."</p>

<p>City Tone (1340) 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "Dream of the Red Chamber Tune" (Part 1)</p>
<p>In the first month, plum blossoms bloom in scattered beauty. With pepper flowers, we offer praises to wish for a happy new year. Whose residence can rival the splendor of the Rong Mansion as the feast is laid out? The silver candle casts a cold light on the painted screen. Lantern Festival night. Admiring lanterns and blossoms. All under heaven rejoice together in peace and prosperity. Cleverly, Mandarin Duck crafts ivory tablet games. Rousing poets to speak of it to this day. Intoxicated by the east wind, February lengthens. Within the Welcome Spring Pavilion, a hundred flowers bloom. The fair maiden idly plants grass in the deep courtyard. Applying new reds to Shanghai crabapple blossoms. Head full of verdure. Hands full of fragrance. The spirit platform's springtime color is unparalleled. Myriad purples and reds are worthy of entering paintings. Poets lay down their pens, struggling to compose commentary. In the third month of Wuling, the little peach blossoms blush red. Where is Tan Chun fishing for duckweed? The beautiful sun is warm, the fragrant grass green. Supporting me with a cane, I cross the bridge to the east. Frightened swallows dart. Butterflies accompany bees. The jade branches intertwined, their shadows exquisite. The fragrance of flowers assaults, knowing the painting's warmth. The willow wind that brushes the face is not cold. As the moon sets on fading flowers, sorrowfully I lean on the railing. When will Xi Chun return? Fallen reds cover the ground, unswept by anyone. Willow catkins pave a white felt mat on the three paths. The wind blows gently. The sun is radiant. Long and slow, as the years drag on, the partridge sings to heaven. Sitting alone, embracing the qin, I sing a tune. Stealing half a day of leisure from this floating life. In the fifth month, pomegranate flowers bloom, scattering lingering sunset hues. Fengjie's arrival brings auspicious omens, her colorful attire concealing her. Her innate beauty is unmatched. The plums left sour, spurting saliva from the teeth. Talent surpasses all. Appearance is exceptional. A single branch of spring occupies a full ten points of value. Jade bracelets ring on her pale wrists. Banana leaves record events on the gauze window. In the listless sixth month, too lazy to paint eyebrows. An ice-silk fan is carried in hand to brush the face. Dense shade, cicadas chirp among silk trees. The mountain colors are hazy, the rain is also extraordinary. Freshly bathed. The evening breeze is faint. Where the pearl curtain is flung, the setting sun is to the west. Near the pond, Xiang Ling has let flowers bloom everywhere. A clear pool that can soak the poet's spleen.</p>
<p>Lu Qiuxia's Double Pearl Phoenix</p>
<p>Sino-Western (1040) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Dream of the Red Chamber Tune" (Part 2)</p>
<p>In the seventh month, the golden phoenix ascends the small building. Lightly furrowing her brows, Daiyu's jade face is filled with sorrow. Gazing afar, where is her hometown? White clouds and red leaves, both leisurely and far away. Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Shanghai, hidden and secretive. Wounds from spring's lament, sadly linked to the Cowherd. The purple oriole cries through the third watch of the moon. Going south and coming north, rest no more. Sweet osmanthus scents drift in the eighth month sky. Xiang Yun emerges from the eastern hills, carrying the moon. Next door, the sound of a pounding stone urges haste. The silver river is silent, turning the jade disc. The character "heaven" is pure. Dew is cold. On the hundred-foot tower, a person leans on the railing. In the courtyard, the autumn parasol trees are seen gradually falling. First hearing the migrating geese, there is no one who does not vie with the crabapple for clever smiles. Bamboo fences and thatched houses, content with their fate. Solitary and aloof, few kindred spirits. Sitting upright, idly consulting the Diamond Sutra. Moreover, Siqi is a companion. Not accepting even a speck of dust's invasion. In the tenth month of early winter, red blossoms are picked. Bao Qin's rich charm is unparalleled in the world. Her snow-like beauty complements and reflects against each other. Together with the plum blossoms, making a full ten points of spring. Poetry as companion. Brocade as heart. The person is on the first level of the Jade Terrace. The amber cup tilts, releasing rose dew. The Southern Mountain faces the door, turning distinctly. In the eleventh month, the cold wind enters the pines. Xiuyan is enveloped in the snowy wind. The beautiful woman warms herself in the chamber, roasting venison. The bamboo stove boils, the fire freshly red. Competing to chant verses. Rhyming words are skillful. The joy of tilting cups brings pleasure to the heart. Qingwen's beauty is like a myriad miles of rosy clouds. Only with plum blossoms is she different. In the twelfth month, snow presses a branch of flowers. Baochai cleverly leans towards the hair at the temples. The plum blossoms vie with the beauty for elegance and simplicity. In the snow, she plays with fragrance and dabbles in powder. Green vines are still. The jade face is lovely. Entering a charming state, truly worthy of praise. Moreover, there are the sparse shadows of Caiyun. Deeply submerged waters, shallowly enveloping sand. In the intercalary month, bored, I get drunk amidst the blossoms. Cherishing Baoyu's jade within my heart, encompassing the four seasons of spring. How many luxurious dandies are there? Only the sunflower inclines towards the sun. Thousand-day red. Evergreen. Gauze windows and cold bamboo form neighbors. The jade box has not been opened, the Wu Hook sword has not been drawn. Seeking a Peach Blossom Spring to escape the Qin Dynasty.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Epic Film "Charlie Chan's Secret" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Premiering Today at the Grand Theatre</p>
<p>Charlie Chan detective cases have been continuously produced on the silver screen because he is a Chinese detective, so such films have particularly good box office revenue in the Chinese film market, and the male star Warner Oland, who plays Charlie Chan, has become famous as a result. Now, "Charlie Chan's Secret" is scheduled to premiere at the Grand Theatre today (Wednesday). The content is shrouded in mystery, full of dangerous situations, and becomes more interesting the more you watch. This is said to be Warner Oland's most proud and precious work, even more tense and exciting than all previous Charlie Chan detective cases.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Miscellaneous Notes on the Preview of "Spring Flower" <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Mei</p>
<p>Late at night, the preview of "Spring Flower" at the Central Cinema for the first time.</p>
<p>Tan Ying wore black glasses and sat with Bu Gao in the back row. Wu Cun also wore black glasses and was talking to someone in the back. Li Pingqian also rushed over after finishing work on the set of "Peach and Plum's Anxious Beauty". Sun Min nodded to Pingqian in a very leisurely manner. Wang Jiting ran over to greet Tan Ying and Bu Gao. Many other leading actors did not come. Only Yan Yuexian also rushed over when the lights dimmed.</p>
<p>The intoxicating rhythm of a love song propelled the melody of the entire story. This sweet song formed a medium between Old Gao and Second Sister Yuexian. In this annoying song, Old Gao had no gold and no woman. In the middle of this sweet song's rhythm, it is unknown how many heavy changes and twists and turns were experienced. The final ending was that Second Sister Yuexian committed suicide for this song, and the man with the rough voice vowed never to sing this hateful song again.</p>
<p>Old Gao's solid acting goes without saying. Second Sister plays a singer who transitions from wild joy to sorrow with great emotion. Huang Naishuang and Xie Yunqing both put in a lot of effort. You Guangzhao and Zhu Qiuhen's performances are mostly humorous. Wu Cun's daughter, Little Pearl, is extremely cute.</p>
<p>There are extremely beautiful scenes and very skilled techniques. There are even more gimmicks, including a comedy inserted into a film set. The latest issue of Star Bi-Monthly says it is doing "self-satire", which is truly wonderful!</p>
<p>A Scene from "Iron-Blooded General"</p>

<h3 id="e233">Chronicle of the Preparations for the Public Performance of the Insect Voice Society <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Among the many emerging small theater troupes in 1936, the Insect Voice Society can be considered one of the most well-established. Not long after their formation, they ambitiously wanted to launch a grand alliance of theater stages to hold a public performance. At the current stage of the rising national liberation struggle movement, how urgently needed is this! However, although many groups responded to this initiative, as a result of discussions, due to the difficulty in raising funds, it was ultimately put on hold for the time being. At the same time, they also deeply felt that not giving society a good impression and society's inability to provide assistance was inevitable. On the one hand, they were unwilling to disappoint the enthusiastic requests from the masses who held high hopes for them, and finally decided to hold a public performance on their own.</p>
<p>However, the encouragement from countless new messengers who love the art of drama who have joined in succession is also considerable.</p>
<p>They are very strict about the selection of plays, and have repeatedly changed them. Currently, the ones that have been decided on include Tian Han's new play "Bugle Call". There are two songs in the play. The effect of Qian Ying, a member of the society, singing the leading role of the eldest daughter is unknown. They are not confident and will wait for future social criticism.</p>
<p>Others include Yu Chu's "Doing Good and Giving Generously" and "Father, Son, and Brothers", which will soon be able to meet with people from all walks of life.</p>

<p>At the "Six Arts" literary salon tea party, attendees included "well-known figures in the literary world, including the journal's editors, modernist masters" Mu Shiying, Liu Na'ou, Ye Lingfeng, who "never lets go of his book", and Gao Ming, "the angry-faced teacher Gao", among others. The publisher and editor, Yao Sufeng, was conspicuously absent. The reason is unknown.</p>
<p>Anna May Wong has been more in the spotlight these days than Hu Die. It is said that Hu Die was expelled from Fujian, while Anna May Wong has been busy attending banquets these days. In addition to banquets hosted by Mayor Wu and others, yesterday (17th), Lu Shouli of the International Hotel also "prepared tea and refreshments" on the 14th floor of the hotel's ballroom.</p>
<p>Humor master Lin Yutang attended the banquet for Anna May Wong at the International Hotel. Some say: Lin Yutang should have gone because Anna May Wong once greatly praised our Master Lin when talking to guests, wasn't it? Courtesy demands reciprocity. Master Lin, the founder of "The Analects", had an inescapable duty to go.</p>
<p>"Parents and Children of Culture" is said to be screened at the Jin Cheng Cinema this Friday. As it concerns the life of "Culture", it cannot but be paid attention to.</p>
<p>The Lianhua Pictorial will publish a special memorial issue for the first anniversary of Ms. Ruan Lingyu's death. Contributions from all walks of life are welcome. Works commemorating Ms. Ruan should be sent to Lianhua Pictorial, No. 3, Triangle Street, Xujiahui, Shanghai, before February 25.</p>
