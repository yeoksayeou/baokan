<p>時評</p>
<h3>英美法三國和平協定之傳說</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>本年三月間。倫敦新海軍恊定成立。英美法三國在國際政治上互相提携之趨勢。已漸漸明顯。近者歐洲及遠東之國際戰爭危機日趨銳化。和平之維持。益感困難。英美法三國締結非正式維持和平協定之傳說。於是　。生據前月杪紐約金融界所傳。三國政府欲維持和平與摒除通商障碍。曾在考慮締結非正式協定定。以英國政府為甚。恊定之主旨。為摒除三國政府間之顯著的通商障碍。獎勵他國作同樣舉動。及於戰爭勃發之時。藉非正式之會議。防杜戰爭。或使戰爭局部化。不致靡爛。吾人處身遠東。鑒於太平洋學會討論之無一結果。華盛頓條約於四個月後卽屆滿期。而侵略之勢力。對於和平勢力。正採個別擊破之戰。略驟聞此代表和平勢力之三大國。有携手合作之可能。不問傳聞之眞確性如何。不能不認為一可喜之事也。</p>
<p>英美法三國在此世界危機之中。利害一致。希望相同。維持現狀之心。防止侵略之望。固無分彼此。且國內政治制度。均維持民治制度。不受法西主義或極端之共產主義之支配。說者謂欲免世界文明之破產。惟賴於三國之努力。然三國之所以不能協力奮鬥者。在於經濟上戰爭之未消除。政治上偏見之難於消滅。利害重心之所在。又不一致。英美二國關稅戰爭貨幣戰爭。海外巿塲戰爭甚為劇烈。而美法之間。自大戰以後。或實施定額制度限制美貨。或勒索戰債。提高關稅壁壘。使法貨無在美暢銷之可能。一九二九年經濟大恐慌以後。貨幣戰爭更形銳化。欲三國之携手。此種障碍首宣消除。幸世界經濟漸漸好轉。美國外交當局亦不堅執高率關稅之偏見。和平恊定。在此情形之下。或有可能。</p>
<p>至於政治之偏覓。以美國為最甚。此次玉斯美之太平洋學會中。法國代表以為太平洋集體制度之失敗。咎在美國。蓋不願實施制裁。為美國之最大偏見。孤立局外。而不願負担國際義務。使無此偏見。則日本不足為懼。而德意不敢肆無忌憚也。且英之利害重心。在於歐洲至印度之一綫。法之利害。在於中歐。美則注意遠東。其集中點均不一致。過去美不能限制日本。法不能使德國就範。英不能制裁意大利。均因平時不周他人之急。。而困難降臨之時。曩日友朋亦袖手旁觀矣。今德意日等國侵略之行動。巳可使英美法政治家有相當之覺悟。東隅已逝桑楡非晚維持和平。有賴和平勢力陣綫一致。願三國之朝野領袖。有以副世界和平主義者之渴望也。</p>

<h3>美决定援英先例　保留驅逐艦四萬噸　日本照會送達華府</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）英國政府於七月間通知日美兩國，聲明英國政府决定援引一九三〇年倫敦海軍條約第二十一條「階梯式」條欵、維持驅逐艦總噸位為十九萬噸、（倫敦條約原規定十五萬噸）換言之、卽依照條約應於本年內拆毀之舊艦四萬噸、仍予保持、美國國務卿赫爾頃正式宣佈、美國擬援英國之例、對於超過艦齡限制、依照倫敦條約應行拆毀之驅逐艦四萬噸仍予保持、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本駐美大使齋籐頃以照會一件、送達國務卿赫爾、略謂英國政府依照倫敦條約、應行拆毀之驅逐艦四萬噸旣已要求保留、日本政府茲亦要求將服務年齡屆滿之驅逐艦二·〇五九噸潛水艇一五·五九八噸、一併予以保留云、美國海軍界人士素知日本驅逐艦屆滿年齡者為數較少、實不足以援例保留、故對於該國同時要求保留潛水艇噸位以資抵補之舉、幷不引以為異、至就美國而論、美國驅逐艦屆滿年齡者為數尙多，苟欲援例保留四萬噸、自非難事、卽潛水艇屆滿年齡者亦在所有之、儘可予以保留、因此日本提高海軍噸位之舉、美國不患無法應付、但美國政府現已决定援引英國先例、而將依照倫敦條約所應拆毀之驅逐艦仍保留四萬噸、此層頃由國務卿赫爾予以證實、但對於潛水艇噸位如何辦理、尙未有所决定、此在海軍各專家均主張將屆滿年齡之潛水艇同時予以保留、緣現行海的、當於本年年底滿期、美國國會若能在本年之內、將英美法三國前在倫敦所簽訂之新海約加以批准、則自明年一月一日起、海軍量的限制辦法卽不復存在、自可充分保留舊潛水艇噸位故也、（按英美法三國本年所簽訂之新海約、僅載質約限制辦法）（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日要求保留潛艇　英海軍界之意見</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英海軍界中人士對於日本此項决定、議論紛紛、意見頗不一致、因嚴格而論、倫敦海約僅許日本保留之軍艦、須與英國所保留者同屬一類、但日方則辯稱、其海軍中所有艦齡過老之驅逐艦為數不多、與條約中所許可之二萬八千噸相差頗鉅、故以潛艇補足之云云、英國之海軍專門家皆信日本現有之潛艇，實已達到條約中所許可之最高噸位、目下如再欲保留、則其本年底時、其數量必將逾限甚鉅、又聞美國似不致提出抗議、因日本之行動並不違反條約之精神、且以該約不久卽將滿期、保留舊潛艇、實較建築新驅逐艦經濟多多也、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國計畫　强化商船隊　添造三百五十艘</h3>

<h3>邊境糾紛迭出　俄拒絕日抗議　東寗事件咎在日方　要求組委員會處理</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）日本駐蘇代辦昨往蘇俄遠束部長卡滋羅夫斯基氏、關於所謂蘇聯邊軍在東寗地方侵犯邊界、非法開槍事件提出抗議、據日代辦聲稱、八月廿八日東寗地方有槍彈八粒、從蘇境落入滿境、同日同地又有蘇聯機關槍向石龍屯日邊軍轟射、結果「滿」人受傷一名、同日同地復有蘇聯飛機侵入「滿」境、</p>
<p>卡氏已斷然拒絕日方抗議、聲明渠本人曾於八月廿七日向日代辦抗議日「滿」兵士轟擊在蘇境內飲馬之蘇邊軍事件、並要立卽澈查懲辦、卡氏請日代辦注意當八月廿九日日方提出反抗議、聲稱該事伴係發生於滿境、而蘇邊軍並曾遺屍一具於滿境內時、李維諾夫已斷然折絕該抗議、云其係根據全不確實之報告、並特別指出遺棄紅軍死屍一具於滿境之虛偽、同時、對於有意引起邊境衝突之日「滿」方面非法舉動重申斷然抗議、</p>
<p>卡氏指出渠根據極正確並經證實之記錄、可以堅决聲明日方所得關於八月廿八日蘇邊軍曾在東寗附近侵犯邊界之報告、完全係屬僞造、卡氏請日代辦注意八月三十一日新近又發生之日「滿」軍隊轟射蘇聯邊軍事件、卡氏云、「滿洲」日當局此種不斷僞造消息、及企圖將造成嚴重局面之責任諉諸蘇聯之舉動、使人感覺日本駐滿某一部份軍人係在企圖預先掩飾彼等所準備之新挑釁行動、並使其為合理、蘇聯政府請日政府特別注意此點、並聲明應由日方負全責、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府以為目前邊境形勢之繼續存在、實屬不能忍受並危及和平、因此建議立卽組織一蘇日「滿」共同委員會、卽日政府於二月十四日已經正式贊同、而其實地組織則係因日方之過而致延遲者、此委員會應被授權澈查一切近頃之此類事件、卡氏最後請日代辦注意關於最近蘇「滿」邊界各處日「滿」軍隊侵犯蘇邊之事伴、蘇政府已訓令其駐東京大使提出抗議、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>非常時期的食糧自給問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 江蘇敎育學院農學系主任童潤之</p>
<p>（一）非常時期食糧自給問題的重要</p>
<p>食糧自給是非常時期一個很重要的問題。歐戰的時候，德國之所以敗，恊約國之所以勝，牠的關鍵就在這一點。在這個時期當中，全國民衆不能不注意到食糧生產與民食節約約一個問題。不過這件工作太重大，非由政府製定政策，統制食糧的生產消費·和分配，不能够收效；而且有許多工作，如地權分配，荒地利用，食糧價格的規定，商人壟斷的防止等等，更非政府用政治力量來統制不為功。但是政府的統制政策，如果沒有民衆的力量來作後盾，也難推行無碍歐戰的時候，英·美·德·法推行食糧統制政策，能有相當成效的，一大半是因為一般民衆平臼已經有了訓練，然而仍然離免發生社會騷擾。德國就因為缺乏食糧而失敗，美國如果不是得天獨厚，生產豐富，也難操勝算。至於我國民衆，一向缺乏敎育，一旦戰事發生，種種分崩離析，顚沛紛擾的現象，必定隨之而起，維持治安巳成絕大問題，何况是食糧統制呢！這裏需要大規模而極有效的民衆敎育，來指導他們如何在政府統制之下努力增加生產，運銷生產品，幷節制消費。如果農民能鎭定的從事生產，而使食糧的供給無慮，那麼戰事才有把握。所以非常時期不能不有民衆敎育，而民衆敎育不能不注意到這個食糧自給問題。</p>
<p>（二）我國食糧自給的現狀及戰事爆發後的推測</p>
<p>我國平常時期的食糧能自給麼？這個問題的答案，要從我國平時食糧的生產量消費量和國際貿易的情形上來分析。我國主要的食糧是米麥和雜糧。據中央農業實騐所的估計，最近三年（民廿二至民廿四）平均每年所產各種食糧，大約是十八萬萬石，其中稻的八萬萬石，麥四萬五千萬石。就數量上看，我國可算為世界最大的米麥生產國家。不過生產雖多，消費亦大。全年消費量雖然沒有指確的統計，但從米麥歷年入超的情形上看，就可知道我們所產的米麥還不能自給，米是向來不够消費的，洋米入口年有增加，民國元年是二百七十萬石，十一年增加到一千九百餘萬石，二十一年更增加到二千三百萬石，而每年出口的數量則很少。小麥在民國十二年以前，不獨可以自給，而且年年有出超。但自十三年以後，除民國十六年有很少的出超以外，其餘各年都是入超年。近年來每年入口數量總在二千萬石左右。再據海關最近報告，民國二十四年米的入口總値是九千三百萬元，比二十三年增加百分之四十二；小麥的入口總値是三千六百萬元，比上年增加百分之十四。米麥兩項合計就有一萬二千萬元的漏巵，由此可見本國所產米麥不能自給，而且缺乏的程度還在年年加深。此外雜糧及雜糧粉，原來可以自給，民國二十一年以前出超是很大，但大半產於東北，幷且亦東北各商埠出口，但是九一八以後，海關貿易册上，幾乎沒有雜糧出口的報告，可知近年來雜糧自給亦成問題。總而言之，我國食糧從各方面觀察是不够消費的，而缺乏的數量還在年年加多。</p>
<p>米麥雖年有入口，但入口的數量和總消費量相比較則很低微。假定吃米的人數佔全國人口之半，每人每年的消費量是兩石，則全年的總消費量大約五萬萬石，每天的消費量約一百三十餘萬石，那麼每年兩千萬石洋米的進口，祇供全國吃米人口兩個星期的食糧，所缺的數量不能算大。日本每年米的入超額，佔全消費量百分之十四，比我國米糧缺乏的程度要高得多。關於小麥雖年有入超，但入超數量亦僅佔消費總額的百分之一；若是沒有小麥及麵粉進口，則所缺的麥糧也不過是十天的量。因此有人說，我國食糧雖不能完全自給，但離自給的程度很近；祇要生產稍為增加，糧食可以無慮。但這話就平常時期看是對的，在非常時期情形就有兩樣。平時食糧可以自給的國家，戰時往往不能自結。平時不能目給還可以補救，戰時食糧不能自給則危險極大。假定我們現在不注意這個食糧問題，那麼一到了戰時，必定發以下幾個不幸的現象：</p>
<p>（一）耕地减少，荒地加多　這是因為（一）一部份少壯農民直接或間接參加軍事工作不能從事耕植；（二）戰區或戰區附近耕作不便，或已種而不能收；（三）農民畏戰逃避，以致田園荒廢；（四）習性不良的農民，乘機放棄原有職業，來作不正當的勾當；（五）一部份耕地被敵人佔據，農產物不為我人所有，如東北四省就是如此。</p>
<p>（二）糧食减少，物價漲高　這是因為（一）耕地旣然减少，產量亦隨之而减；（二）交通不便，不獨洋米難以進口，就連內地米麥的運輸也較平時困難；（三）奸商壟斷市塲，私屯糧食，以致價格高漲；（四）一般人民爭購食糧，以作不時之需，市塲供給日漸其少；（五）戰時人民的食慾反而增大，食糧更感不足。</p>
<p>（三）社會秩序紊亂，軍事大受影響這是因為（一）糧食缺乏，人心大亂；（二）漢奸紛起，後方無法安定，多數人民祗知避難逃亡，不知自衛；（三）糧餉不足，軍紀不能維持；（四）軍力分而防內，不能集中對外。</p>
<p>以上三種現象都是直接間接由於糧食的缺乏而發生的。要想避免以上現象，不得不早早的準備。這種準備固然要靠政府規定幷推行食糧統制的辦法，但是民衆自己的努力和準備是格外要緊的。</p>
<p>那麼我們一般國民究竟應當如何努力如何恊助政府來解决這個食糧自給問題呢？我以為要向三方面努力：一是努力增加食糧的生產量，以减少入超；二是提倡幷實行食糧的節約。以减少消費的數量，三是鎭靜農民的心理，以維護農業的勞動。如果這三種工作都有成效，那麼在非常時期我們不怕食糧不够。現在讓我分開來說</p>
<p>（三）如何增加食糧的生產量</p>
<p>增加食糧生產的方法很多，我現在僅提出四種比較重要的：</p>
<p>（一）採用優良的稻麥品種　非常時期當中，我們從事食糧生產的鄕村同胞，應該多多與農業試騐和敎育機關聯絡，改用優良的稻麥品種，來增加食糧生產。現在國內各地農業實騐及敎育機關，經多年的育種與試騐工作，已經育成優良的稻麥雜糧品種很多，可以供給各地農民採用。小麥已經改良成功而已推廣的有十五個品種左右，正在繁殖卽供推廣之用的亦有十幾個品種，在試驗期中而有推廣希望的品種更多；平均的產量比各地農家的品種多百分之二十以上。水稻品種已經改良成功幷已推廣的在二十種以上，平均能增加產量百分之十以上。雜糧品種已經改良成功的，小米有十三品種，高粱有十一品種，其他如大豆·玉米等，均有人作育種工作而有良好成績。我國鄉村同胞，如果能一面自己作選種工作，一面與各地農業敎育或推廣機關切實聯絡，採用優良的品種改良栽培方法，我相信五年以後，全國食糧的生產可以增加到百分之十。</p>

<h3>兩廣鹽運使　唐海安昨午抵滬　據談奉孔財長召商鹽政　兩廣鹽稅經整頓已增加　桂事一兩週內可吿解决</h3>
<p>兩廣鹽運使兼廣東省財政廳高級顧問唐海安氏、前於江海關監督任內、在粵局平定前、因公南下、旋出任今職、茲奉孔財長電召、已於昨午十二時許、乘藍烟囱公司克林格萊號輪（港電誤報為寳丹號輪）抵滬、輪泊浦東該公司碼頭、唐氏換登小輪、至新關碼頭登岸、當返福開森路私邸休息、下午三時半、現任江海關監督諸昌年往訪、晤談甚久、嗣唐氏於六時許、赴中央銀行謁孔財長長談、詳細商陳一切、新聲社記者昨特住訪於其寓次、承見告各情如次、</p>
<p>奉孔電召　商陳鹽政</p>
<p>唐氏首談、本人對整頓兩廣鹽政、前有詳細計劃報告書、由航空寄呈孔部長、旋奉孔部長電、着北來當面商陳、爰卽遄程來滬、何時南旋、須俟謁孔部長商談各事後、再為决定、</p>
<p>鹽稅過去　不振原因</p>
<p>兩廣鹽運使陳繼周在任八年、祇民國二十一年、收入一千二百萬、其後每年不過九百萬、查所以不振之原因、全在於緝私之疏忽、陳氏將各地稅警二十五中隊悉數改編為特務團、都三千人、又將十二艘緝私艦隊、撥歸省府緝私總處、托該處代辦鹽緝、職是之故、海陸走販私鹽者、為所欲為、</p>
<p>整頓以來　收入大增</p>
<p>緣鹽稅之增進與吾、厥視緝私力量如何、本人蒞任後、有鑒及此、首將稅警恢復、縮編為十八中隊、約二千人、分派各地、更自省府緝私總處、收回十二艘艦隊、加以修理、分發六門、（卽虎門等）並裁去陳氏任內特稅加二特稅加三及漏規非法稅目、雖余就任未及一月、在此一月間、於無形之中、稅收已增加數十萬、以後如無軍事障礙、每年可增加至一千八百萬、</p>
<p>對於鹽稅　將來展望</p>
<p>七年以前、廣西一向購買粵鹽、近來改購越鹽、若桂局平定、粵鹽再重向廣西推銷、每年稅收、尙須多增數百萬，又贛南湘南、七年前亦係購食粵鹽、後改購淮鹽、將來粵漢鐵路全綫通行、粵鹽運入湘贛、祇須一日、運輸便利、鹽價較輕、一經推銷、又可年增稅收數百萬、預計兩廣鹽稅收入、最高度每年可達二千六百萬至二千八百萬之多、</p>
<p>撙節經費　愼重用人</p>
<p>關於經費方面在陳維周任內、年需一百八十萬、本大奉孔部長命、竭力撙節、現預算每年祇需十八萬、卽本人到任一月內、已减少六十餘萬、以後一兩月後、猶可减去一二十萬、目下內外工作人員、（稅警艦隊除外）共有一千餘人、對於用人一層、務必愼重、須資格相當、具有殷實誧保、更注重其人格道德之修養、董以稅務人員、非其人操守淸廉不可、譬如艦隊職員、必需有航海智識、經訓練有素、一切根據中央稅警制度、將來最好特設學校、專門訓練、惟此不過一種擬議、須向孔部長睛示决定、</p>
<p>粵省財政　漸上軌道</p>
<p>旋記者叩以關於粵省財政情形、唐氏謂、粵省財政、從前混亂不堪、本人曾奉命往返奔走多次、自政府問題解决、宋廳長（子良）到任以來、努力整頓、將過去畸形稅收機關、一一裁撤、各機關陣容一新、雖為時不久、已漸上軌道、以前每月收入六百萬、今則可達八百萬、猶憶宋部長（子文）在粵時、曾達一千四百萬、以宋廳長之努力、將來亦可達一千四百萬、至於改革幣制、孔部長前派鄒（琳）徐（堪）兩次長、吳署長（啟鼎）·陳副總裁（行）·唐壽民·貝淞孫·等氏南下、開會數十次、種種問題、雖非一朝一夕所克完全解决、惟大致均有辦法、經孔部長核奪、現規定粵幣與法幣價格、為一元五角與一元之比、將來逐漸收回雜幣、完成法幣制度、過去區芳浦在財廳長任內、白銀僅有一萬萬、而發行鈔票達二萬萬五千萬、相差如是之鉅、現在金融安定、粵省人民、對於政府設施、俱稱滿意</p>
<p>桂局解决　一兩周事</p>
<p>記者又叩以桂事如何、唐氏答、關於桂省局勢、余非政治人員、不甚知情、惟據觀察、解决桂局、乃一兩周間事、特和平尙在進行中耳云、唐氏末稱、凡人之辦事認眞、必遭人忌、余就任伊始、收到各方介紹求職函、凡三千餘封、因限於經費範圍、未能一一延用、致有失望者、深致不滿、惟個人祇知服從黨國、他非所計也云、</p>

<p>為調整中國佛敎會　吿全國僧尼（續）　張廷灝　（四）常年捐的規定</p>
<p>常年捐、可以說並不是新加的、在去年一月、中國佛敎會早已自己定了一份寺廟興辦慈善公益事業規則、呈經內政部核准備案、不過該項規則、因為定的人大都是收入較多的大叢林的住持、所以對於收入較少的寺庵、成數定得高、對於收入較多的寺庵，成數定得反而低、要知道全國寺庵、收入較少的占大多數、照該項規則所定的成數、收入一百元者捐百分之一、假定這種寺庵的住僧、每廟作三人計算、一百元的收入、要維持三人全年的衣食、實在已經很苦了、但是還要他捐百分之一、而收人數萬元者、其人數、未必比例增加、其開支、倘使不濫用、也未必特別加多、可是所捐的、和收入一千元者一樣、也不過百分之五、豈非顯分厚薄、太不公平、僧尼苦行自勵、原是本分、但是生計究屬不能置之不顧、而况同是僧尼、如果待遇不公、更有失佛氏平等的敎旨、章程草案所定和原定規則比較、减低收入較少者的成數、酌量增高收入較多者的成數、無非根據事實、求得其平罷了、况且捐欵的用途、是辦理敎育和慈善公益事業的、僧尼假使明白佛氏利他精神、當不至違心反對罷、</p>
<p>本人旣然歡迎全國僧尼對於章程草案盡量發表意見、只要理由充足、反對者的意見、當然也可容納、不過像中國佛敎會現任常務理事會最近為分發硏究本人所擬的章程革案、致全體理監事的信中、對於取消省分會改採兩級制一點、明明是該會前屆理事會所主張、在第七屆全代會前、呈請前中央民運會要求修改、經前民運會歷舉應行考慮之點、令飭再行硏究、後經該會呈復、竭力解釋、前民運會才於第七屆全代會後、暫准其備案、乃信上反說、「遵照中央指導改進之意旨、將各省佛敎會廢止」、把廢止省佛敎會的主張、推之於中央、和海潮昔第十七卷第七號上如「金山會議與中央意見」、「關於中國佛敎會事件、和「從中國佛教會史上檢討中央修正草案」等文中、一再說、中央民訓部派員參加指導金山會議、和中國佛敎會現被停止活動、按諸事實、民訓部吳處長到鎭江、明明是去制止開會、並非是去指導開會、民訓部和內政部、也並未停止中國佛敎會的活動、雙方這種種故意抹殺事實、自欺欺人的狡獪手段、不但存心謊騙全國的僧尼、簡直是蔑視中央、「妄」是佛門戒律之一、旣然做了淸凈具戒的佛子、還要效法陰險刁詐的政客行為、試問如何對得起釋迦、如何對得起全國的儈尼、佛以懺悔為重、所以我希望一般固持我執、仍想明爭暗鬭、不惜犯戒壞行、失却正信的佛子、快快誠懇地懺悔一下、不要再有違反佛法的言行、還是共同努力、謀中國佛敎的復興罷、</p>
<p>譬如一所學校、原來是很腐敗、毫無紀律的、一旦敎育當局、定了幾條辦法、嚴飭整頓、在初、除了一二眞正為敎育而做敎員的敎員之外、當然不但學生們呌苦連天、恐怕就是濫竽充數的敎員們、也未必不大感不便、不過師生們如果能够决心遵行、行之稍久、學校的學風改好、學生的學業進步、結果、名譽和實際的利益、還是全校師生享受的、本人這次奉命調整中國佛敎會、擬訂佛敎會章程草案、其情形實在也類乎此、全國的住持和僧尼們、你們願意佛敎會永久腐敗呢、還是希望整頓、</p>
<h3>本年第二季　上海工商業異動報吿（續）　（上海工商業槪况之三十五）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>B六月份重要工商行家之異動</p>
<p>甲，特種事業方面</p>
<p>一，通易信託公司停業淸理－該公司創立於民國十年七月，迄今已十有五年，資本定額為國幣二百五十萬元，實收額一百三十六萬元。由董事長黃溯初君兼任總經理。專營銀行，信託，儲蓄，保險等業務。設分公司於北平，杭州，蘇州各地，並於廣州，漢口，南京，海門設有保險分局及儲蓄分部。平日營業以儲蓄為主幹，最盛時曾吸收存欺達五百萬元；惟自滬戰及不景氣空氣瀰漫全國以還，資本逃避之現象卽日趨顯著。廿三年時通易銀行倒閉，該公司因名稱雷同，影響頗巨，更以市面凋疲，投資於工業者苦於無法收回，投資於地產者又遭地價暴落，經營證劵亦因政府統一公債，大受影響，加以粵桂變故，提存者日形踴躍，每日被提輒至一二十萬元，故存欵額卽驟减至二百餘萬元，且夏節及銀行半年結算期接踵而來，錢業又擬收回三對六放欵，兼之因經營標紗一萬包失利，損失近十萬元，迨至十五日晚因有本蔡若干未能兌現，遂告無法週轉；雖事先董監事會盡力掙扎，卒亦不能挽在瀾於旣倒，不得已於十六日宣告停業。</p>
<p>二，四明銀行增加資本　該行原定資本實收額為國幣二百二十五萬元，上月間該行召開第二十八屆股東常會時，曾由董事會提議增加商股一百七十五萬元，合原有資木共計四百萬元，當經到會股東通過一假决議；茲復於本月二十一日召開二次大會，正式通過招股。</p>
<p>三，工部局投資銀行復業　該行係工部局所設，停辦於民國十八年工部局電政處出售以後，彼時因電政處有人承購，其所得售價足可供一切鉅大需要，故將該銀行停辦。最近工部局董事會據財務處處長之建議，鑒於本年市政公債之銷售情形，决將該行恢復營業，於六月一日起卽開始收受存欵。該行業務之主要目的，為予市民以投資市政債券之種種便利，同時亦可使工部局得一可恃之資源，於每年五月五日及十一月五日將每戶存欵之適當部份向工部局轉購市政債劵。</p>
<p>四，航運業方面，招商局內河輪船總局之停辦亦為衆所注目，該局直屬於國營招商局，為官商合辦股份有限公司性質。共有內河輪船二十艘及貨船拖船二十艘。歷年以來，營業不起；自國營招商局將該局業務收回自營後，雖經竭力整頓，然終因負債過鉅，維持困難，且江浙兩地，因年來公路交通發展甚速，內河航業實際上日趨淘汰地位，甚少挽救希望，故兼任經理勞勉君不得已將整頓經過及困難情形呈報交通部核辦，當蒙覆令停辦結束，並將所有船隻分別出售，一面於本月二十五日召開股東會，俾將結束實情報告各股東。</p>
<p>五，娛樂業中，本月廿一日大新游樂塲之開幕亦為重要異動之一，該塲地位自大新公司五樓迄屋頂止，內部極為寬敞，經大新公司佈置就緖後，卽由興發公司承辦開業。故該塲雖屬大新公司所有，然營業責任，全由興發公司負責。（未完）</p>

<p>吾國選手團隨征記　（第十一信）中央社特派員馮有眞寄</p>
<p>（五）（三）籃球出師不利初戰敗於日本</p>
<p>大會第七日、開始籃球第一週比賽、共有九塲對壘、此外尙有美國對西班牙一組、因西班牙未參加大會、捷克對匈牙利一組、匈牙利棄權、及菲列濱輪空、均不勞而升入第二週、</p>
<p>九組中以中國對日本一戰、最為觀衆興趣所集中、前往作壁上觀者達二千餘人、與其他各塲冷冷靜靜者、情况逈不相同、</p>
<p>我國方面無論其為代表團職員選手、無論其為留歐的學生、對此戰之勝敗、關心均萬分殷切、一則是因為各項運動都已失敗了、祇有籃球才有上進的希望、一則是大家都希望能在歐洲人前面、把素為我們手下敗將的日本籃球隊、殺他一個落花流水、所以在柏林的中國人、自戴院長程大使以次、幾於全體動員、在德國的留學生、以及在歐洲其他各國留學而到柏林參觀大會的學生、事前並組織個啦啦隊、到塲助威、他們在塲上很整齊的歡呼吶喊、較之日本方面、祇有一個人拿了面國旗、唱獨脚戲、聲勢眞是相差百倍、可是比賽的結果、我們被日本　敗、而且敗得很慘、無異給大家兜頭澆了一盆冷水、一個個都心灰意懶、乖頭喪氣、而球員方面、更是受了極大的打擊、比賽完畢後、都呆若木鷄、回到奧林匹克新村的時候、痛哭流淚、悲傷寓分、這幕比　的失敗、所給予大家的刺激、眞是異常悲壯的、我想當記者在比賽的時候、把經過情形由無綫電傳到國內的時候、聽衆也一定是十分氣憤的吧、失敗的最大原因、就是由於大家把這幕比賽的勝敗、看得太嚴重的緣故、在柏林的同胞、大家都存着祗能勝不能敗的心理、不過得失之心太重大了、對於球員心情上的影響、實在太大、自從上月二十七日抽定秩序後、籃球隊隊員差不多天天都在躭心這塲比賽的勝敗、一半是由於外來的刺激、一半也是由於內心的感發、所以等到上塲比賽的時候、每個人的心情都異常緊張、神經異常興奮、而緊張興奮的結果、就是陣綫十分慌亂、技術全失常態、當牟作雲在籃下開打紀錄後、日本方面連續有四次罰規、就因為求勝太切、心情慌亂的緣故、竟一次都沒有罰進去、而日本藉罰球機會、竟兩罰兩中、此後又一擲一罰、以五比二占先、我們隊員因此益為失態、假使大家能鎭靜作戰、不失掉罰球的機會、那末開塲我們就以六此〇占先、氣勢完全不同、比賽也就成了另外一個局面、總計全塲我隊共得罰球十三次、祗中三次、而日本方面十七次罰球中、僅失六次、情况亦可想而知、其次日本方面球藝的進步、也是不可一筆抹殺的、他們採取穩紮穩打的策略、一點都不花巧、可是非常結實、進攻時找到一點空隙、就如水銀瀉地的鑽了進去、防守的時候、陣地佈置得異常嚴密、不輕易漏出缺陷、他們這次的球隊、較之上屆遠東運動大會的球隊、是不可以道里計的、他們這種刻苦訓練力求上進的精神、無論如何我們是應該引為訓鑑的、敎練董守義重病進了醫院、臨陣無人指點、隊長王玉增小病初愈、體氣不足、對於比賽的勝敗、多少也有點關係、</p>
<p>上半時努力掙扎</p>
<p>開塲後、日方曾一度向我投籃未中、我隊旅即採取攻勢、幾度傳遞、牟作雲在籃下縱身一揚、已破網圈、打開紀錄、全塲歡聲雷動、派頭十足、日本拼命反攻、動作不免粗魯、先後四次犯規、我方均輕輕放過、李紹唐違犯軍法、日方毫不客氣、一一命中、橫山人小膽大、活潑伶俐、右角初試身手、適中紅鵠、繼以一記罰球、五比二後來居上、牟作雲王玉增不甘屈服、籃下先後偷渡、六比五再度超出、日方再藉罰球得分、七比六我又落後、此後日方穩紮穩打、乘虛而進、連加八分、我方竟束手無策、牟王雖各建一功、十五比十、上半時我仍失利、</p>
<p>下半時一敗塗地</p>
<p>休息再戰日方又以罰球得分、小牟爭回一球後、李紹唐徒刑期滿、宣吿下野、王士選登壇拜將、威風不减、日方三鋒突然活躍、二擲一罰、二十比十　遙居上風、沈聿功入代牟作雲、先來一個下馬威、王玉增罰球初中、追成二十對十五、好像大有轉機、但曇花一現、好景不常、日方連加八分後、沈聿功始藉罰球扳回兩球、時間不多、日方採取延宕政策、我軍拼命血戰、反而露出空隙、又送五分、王玉增遠中一球、日方亦照樣回敬、鳴金收軍、我方以三十五比十九慘遭敗衂、</p>

<h3>紗花　風暴無甚損害　棉花跌風重起　幸賴大戶補空祗跌六七角</h3>
<p>棉市前以颶風將臨、人心興奮而回漲、詎料美棉忽由漲轉跌、而颶風亦平穩過去、江浙棉區、未聞受若何損害、因此人心急轉直下、市價乃猛烈下降、惟長和空額大量抵補、近三萬擔之巨、故市價賴以維持、</p>
<p>長和大量抵補</p>
<p>標棉上午開盤、因連日報漲之美棉、忽以天氣順利而跌、同時本市天氣晴朗、颶風已過、並未經過重要棉區、新棉收成、不致受何影響、人心一致看低、塲中賣風甚濃、近月猛跌七八角、遠月跌五六角、二盤以後、稍見穩定、因長和大量補空、努力購進達二萬二千餘擔、故檯面因之堅定、惟通記·合興·興昌·泰昌·森康·長豐等號、均大量賣出、各達五六千擔、收盤較上日跌六角五分至八角、午後開盤、因長和繼續抵補、散戶亦多補進、人心帶堅、回漲二角至二角五分、但三收盤因買風稍平、價復趨軟、結果較上午收盤價回漲五分至二角、査賣出者計吉豐二千擔、大孚九千擔、通記五千二百擔、裕大五千八百擔、合興六千七百擔、賡豐二千九百擔、興昌六千八百擔、森康四千七百擔、泰昌五千五百擔、長豐九千六百擔、大昶三千七百擔、崇安四千六百擔、永昌二千八百擔、買進者計恒益二千擔、裕康二千九百擔、愼記二千四百擔、義成昌二千八百擔、益昶五千七百擔、潤康八千九百擔、生源六千一百擔、永大順二千一百擔、信誠昌三千五百擔、長和二萬八千六百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>實銷雖佳原棉看小　紗市仍受牽制　－拋空聲浪甚高－</h3>
<p>紗市因連日報漲之美棉、忽以天氣良好、棉收順利而回跌、更以颶風中心、未經滬杭、新棉收穫，不致有若何影響、市塲人心對於原棉一致看低、紗市遂受其牽制、但現紗銷路頗足使人興奮、川粵津湘內地諸帮進胃甚濃、現紗存底日枯、故實際地位、殆甚堅定也、</p>
<p>標紗跌二元强</p>
<p>標紗上午開盤、因美棉以氣候利於棉收、回跌十餘磅音、本市氣候轉晴、而颶風中心、並未過滬、且其經過區域不廣、棉作未受若何影響、市塲人心、對於原棉又抱看低觀念、羣趨拋賣、因此檯面鬆濫、各月期猛跌二元四五角、二三盤因有一部份獲利了結、市况稍平、但收盤又復疲軟、長豐獨進四千四百包、恒益·明德·泰昌·生源等號各進一千餘包、崇安及通記各售出三千餘包、賡豐·振大·合興·益昶售出一千餘包至二千餘包不等、收盤較昨日跌二元四角至三元一角、午後開盤、因空戶抵補、現銷暢旺、人心回高、各月漲五六角、三盤以後、又復疲軟、結果較上午收盤價漲起一角至九角、査賣出者計吉豐一千四百包、通記三千六百包、大豐九百包、達記一千零五十包、合興九百包、賡豐二千七百包、仁豐九百包、益昶一千八百五十包、崇安三千一百包、買進者計恒益一千九百包、聚興七百包、明德二千九百包、長餘八百包、恒昌九百包、長豐六千四百五十包、泰興一千四百五十包、潤康二千八百包、協成九千五百包、生源一千包、永大順二千包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現紗津銷亦動</p>
<p>現紗銷路益見暢達、天津帮購進一十支彩飛機鴻禧藍鳳等紗六百餘包、湘粵等帮進胃亦尚不衰、共成交二千一百八十包、售價因標紗疲軟、跌一元左右、各帮購額如下、</p>

<h3>美棉起伏靡定　最後下挫十餘磅音</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月由不動至跌三磅音、私人報告、鐵克塞斯西部有雨、棉農套賣及本地帮售出、旋利物浦帮·同業·及空戶買進、略見回好、卒以南方賣出增加、又形反動、在政府報告發表以前、新戶缺乏、現需平靜、東部棉區有雲雨、中部及魯意西那天氣良好、密昔昔比及西部有雲、或將有雨、收盤平疲計現貨跌十磅音、期貨跌八至十六磅音、英棉現貨漲八點、期貨漲跌一點、印棉散戶多頭了結、歐洲出口商買進、空戶抵補、市况堅定、其後多頭了結、但為同業買進所吸收、計平果爾漲一羅比、奧姆辣漲一·七五羅比、白羅溪漲一·五羅比、原電錄左、（三日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、四日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百十一羅比半、跌一·七五羅比、奧姆辣為一百八十八羅比半、跌一·七五羅比、平果爾為一百五十二羅比半、跌一·七五羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗花漲跌互見　四日大阪電、三品期紗近漲遠跌、由漲二元至跌九角、近月為二百十三元九角、遠月為二百零一元二角、期棉跌五角五分至一元一角、近月為六十五元六角、遠月為六十二元二角五分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布價不易安定</h3>
<p>昨本埠團風方向轉移、棉田可告無虞、美棉回跌、致各界心意突趨下游、紗花一致狂瀉、本市重又下跌、回復前日市盤、在此驟升驟降之際、人心益為忐忑、售盤紊亂、手貨廉價斬出頗多、故本埠成交貨達四百餘件、仍以染廠吸去細斜較多、因客帮染色斜紋去胃漸增、細斜經染廠發染及粵帮動辦之後、銷數頗形活潑、而細布漂布閩粵等帮、印花絨彩條絨白襯絨及花素直貢嗶嘰各式綫呢辦胃頗濃、緣各地秋凉之後、門市交易日形繁忙、故催交定貨益急、各廠趕緊交解、連日漢口南昌一帶逐日均三百餘件裝出、惟陸運各貨因海關通運照手續耽擱、各廠號存擱待裝之貨、頗見擁擠云、</p>
<h3>金融　買戶始盛繼衰　標金下挫一元七　賣齊突來浮多動搖</h3>

<p>查一天市况疲弱、晨開為一一二七元半、後收為一一二五元九角、最高價一一二七元六角、最低價一一二五元九角、有一元七角上落、結果較前收下跌一元七角、本月份條子剩六百七十二條、共計多方九家、空方五家、十月期陣容計八千三百六十五條、共計多頭二十九家、空頭四十三家、成交總數、計前市六百五十一條、後市三百七十一條、</p>
<h3>滙兌上升美元步鬆</h3>
<p>滙市昨以匯兌上升、結果英平美鬆、掉期較殷、晨初以海外電告、倫敦大條近遠俱縮〇六二五、脚地謂收市後、市况極穩、照掛牌均為買戶、成交極少等說、紐約銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價跌四毫至一釐半不等、倫教生金縮半便士、英對美升半分、英對法漲六鎊音、美對英長三七五、美對法縮〇六二五、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、匯市晨開近期賣價英匯一先令二便士三七五及四〇六二五對搭、美匯三十元一八七九、較之前收、計英美俱平、開後銀行粉紛對做掉期過程徘徊、匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、以及白銀平衡稅小二五、中途缺乏變化、午刻仍多掉期及匯兌成交而平、後市銀行略拋美金、但因華商維持尙乏大變、印銀初長後縮、軋過尚大一安那美金稍鬆、收盤近期賣價英匯一先令二便士三七五及四〇六二五、美匯三十元一八七五及二五對搭、較之前收、計英平美鬆〇三一二五、今將一天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>證券　大戶觀望不動　債市愈覺沉悶</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市面依然未有稍稍活動、呆滯盤旋、愈見沉悶、市塲集會人數、愈見稀少、大戶固仍觀望、散戶亦人心渙散、旣不感興趣、自出入更少、環境上亦仍在醞釀期內、昨日經過、大都平疲、後小五分一角、次盤及午後開盤、依然極度盤旋、浮沉於五分一角之間、收盤五十三號稍有賣出、一半平穩、一半略小五分一角、多日來盤旋醞釀、沉悶已極、已有萬木無聲待雨來之勢、盤旋已久、變化當不在意矣、昨日市價結果、大都微小五分一角、遠期戊種小二角半為最小、丁丙兩種遠期好五分、成交總數共計三百四十萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食　期盼買氣甚覺沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日紛市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先定後則鬆跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲三四角、坎拿大漲五六角不等、故開價時、近期如九十月份曾見穩固、與前日相仿、十一月份開價、因風雨已息、人心隨軟、洋麥雖好、買氣反寂、因此開價卽下午開盤、交易不暢、市甚寂寞、聞目下各廠均有積粉、銷路則未暢旺且內地廠家、亦有裝申推銷、照此情形、後步或以供多求少之故、恐須自然轉跌云、</p>
<h3>現貨多數套售　期麥盤旋向下</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致盤旋平軟、以洋麥報價雖回漲三四五六角不等、惟以各路到源、近頗不暢、而廠方則因粉銷甚懈、進胃不貪、故手中有現貨之客戶、多數套售、是以初開雖定、後則轉弱、迨至下午開盤、交易不暢、價趨盤旋、觀察後步、恐有盤小之勢、現麥市面、高貨尚穩、中决小落二五分、開穎州麥四元九角半、五河麥四元九角四分、决九角二三分、高郵麥四元八角三分、决七角八分、江北麥四元七角半、洋河麥四元九角三分、合肥麥四元七角九分、湖熟麥四元七角八分、宿遷麥四元七角七八分、淮安麥四元八角二分、次七角八分、明光麥四元八角八分、次八角半、采石麥四元七角二分、决六角七分、蚌埠麥四元七角七分、次七角五六分、漢口車麥四元七角半、决七角二分、由阜豐辦四千包、福新辦五千包、申大辦二千包云、</p>
<h3>厚薄粳高貨尙穩</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共釗十三四號、惟銷塲零躉均淡、兼之天時轉正、人心又虛、致市况呈定中帶疲之局、厚薄粳價除高貨勉能支持外、下檔貨雖經一再削小、而去路仍淡、杜洋尖陰變元悉屬平平、柬新共到七八百石、價守原盤、新尖無上落、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河埠各路來源十六七號、市上各貨去胃、白粳新洋尖轉懈、新團尖廉宜者略有交易、餘貨平常、市價白粳新團尖薄稻小數分至近角、新客尖平疲、羊杜埠尖新羊尖東新粳價格無甚升降、</p>
<h3>粵省辦去客秈甚旺</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭仍旺、惟本客去化更活、市面仍居站局、新到各貨仍以沙漢湘贛為主、而去路亦以粵帮暢辦糙米為最、粵帮連日辦胃甚貪、卽以糙米一項、已經裝出十五萬包左右、昨日汕頭亦動、以及本街內地統計開出萬餘包、因客秈產地出貨甚旺、而申地對存兩足、貨主莫不急於求脫、故行情不易　好、咋日開出贛米一千六百八十五包、湘米五千五百包、沙漢各米三千五百包、台秈一百四十五包、京隨三百包、</p>
<h3>洋莊芝蔴供求相埒　新黃豆亦轉平穩</h3>
<p>洋莊新芝蔴拋盤、賣氣依然頗盛、但達孚洋行進胃亦頗不弱、聞該行價在十二元七八角之時、早已拋於國外、所以目下抵進之貨、權續不姦、昨續辦進八百噸、價為十二元一角半、比較前市、稍修五分、然刻下大勢、買賣雙方、供求悉敵、市態或可導入正軌矣、新黃豆市况、暫時已入穩途、去路油廠南洋本街等俱有問津、昨共成交各路新豆五千餘包云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　用戶絲似有滿足狀　－全日成交一百二十六担－</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、仍趨下游、紐約交易所絲交甚淸、據路透電告、全塲成交僅三百二十包、近遠期開盤價格、各較前日下跌一分、橫濱里昂均吊持原價、申埠外銷絲、目前尚難暢達、昨日法莊白廠B字仍吃價六〇〇元、但未見成交、美莊七八之八〇勻度吃價六二〇元、則較前日跌五元至十元、故次等B字、已有跌進六〇〇元開趨勢、用戶方面、市價亦逐日盤小、如黑飛馬等牌、昨售價為六一〇元、則較前二日跌一七·五〇元、且觀察用戶購胃、亦似相當滿足、故昨日交易已稍遜、全日內外絲銷共成交一百二十六担、洋莊佔六十七担云、</p>
<h3>祁門紅茶英銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日茶市、祁門紅茶、交易繼續暢旺、英莊恊和錦隆等行、進意依然濃厚、全市成交七百餘箱、售價自四十元至四十八元、聞怡和洋行、及蘇聯茶部、亦均有電報兜銷、至綠茶市面、仍無重大進展、僅針眉珠茶、略有零星去化、躉莊珍眉綠茶、交易依然寥落云、</p>
<p>又據茶業公會報告云、綠茶市前因各行準備裝船、市面尚靜、昨又轉形活動、尤以遂安珍眉交易較多、計寶隆進二百箱、協和進四百餘箱、錦隆百餘箱、價五十至五十二元、屯婺珍眉寶隆福時各進二百餘箱、價六十至七十元不等、及恊和對屯婺珍有正批交易、現正在與各棧議盤、日內即可成交、平水茶大帮錦降仍有中下檔拆胃、及另色珠茶雖有談盤、但未聞成交云、</p>

<p>淋濁自療</p>
<h3>久病成良醫之一證</h3>
<p>急淋痛苦多　慢濁病毒深</p>
<p>（本埠法租界喇格納路仁麟里胡君來函云）編輯先生有道：啓者，竊鄙人夙明攝生之理，素來潔身自好，祇因民二十年之冬，因商業上之應酬，與同事數輩，聚宴聯歡，祇以飲酒過度，一時糊塗，酒後興作，隨同事等同作北里之遊，在鄙人誠屬出世以來，破題兒第一遭，不意天不佑人，彼妓不潔，一度失足，遽爾染來淋菌，淋濁交作，苦不堪言，名譽所關，不得不出於秘密，投醫服藥，全不商求友人，當時因徬徨歧途，雜藥亂投，以致收毒入內，化成慢性，險症併發，危害多端，忽而睪丸腫脹，忽而膀胱炎疼，尿灼便赤，苦憚罄述，時而輕瘥，時而爆發，纏綿迄今，時間精神經濟，耗損莫可言宣，以為從此痼疾在身，未能自拯矣，今春否極泰來，幸蒙新聞報醫刋吳大超學士指示，即向永安公司及中英藥房先後購服黃色素及伐克辛合製劑「安敵淋」半打，並投詹念曾醫師處受電療洗射等手術，藥物既靈騐異常，手術又毫無痛苦，半打未完，已尿澄濁凈，炎疼盡去，因同時並服「生殖素」以回復生機，故迅獲康健，愈後檢騐尿液，毫無淋菌蹤跡，雖遇大勞，亦不重發，現在身壯體健，遠勝五年之前，但因追前往日暗中模素之苦，與夫重重損失之巨，有不能已於言者，諒世間抱同病而同樣處境者大不乏人，鄙人既得自拔，亟願來者亦盡同脫苦海，則此信之作，要為已登彼岸者所應盡之天職矣。（下略）</p>
<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<h3>健全的性生活（基于）健全的生殖腺</h3>
<p>夫婦感情淡膜者注意！</p>
<p>夫婦配偶，其重要之目的之一，在得行使滿足其生理上所切要之健全的性生活，惟其如此，則感情融洽，而生育可期，幸福濃郁，而瓦助有濟，否則性生活缺陷孔多，則感情淡漠，生育何望，幸福淺薄，互助難期，故性生活之健全，要為已婚者所當注意，即未婚將婚者，亦不可等閒忽之也！</p>
<p>然健全之性生活果何由獲得乎？曰，在視其生殖腺是否健全，蓋生殖腺對於健康及壽命固有莫大之關係，而對於生殖機能及行使性生活尤有直接之關係，凡生殖腺萎頹者，必罹有種種之性病隱病，在男子則遺精，早洩，滑精，陰痿等症迭出，在婦女則白帶，經亂，乳萎，小產等患蜂起，性能槪遭摧殘，又何克期望享受健全之性生活乎？故凡生殖腺衰頹以致病患百出者，治療不可不亟，而生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」當為其唯一之要劑，不待煩言而自明矣，例如：</p>
<p>患者田君夫婦，結婚以來不下八載，但因夫弱婦病，迄未能夢想健全性生活的幸福，以致身衰體弱，子嗣無望，推考厥因，蓋以田君罹有早洩，陰痿之苦，且常現遺精，失眠，盜汗，體顫等症，百藥罔效，身日衰頹，而田夫人則經來輒感痠痛，白帶亦淋漓不絕，因循自誤，纏綿迄今，以致乳部萎癟臀部瘦削，絲毫無健美狀態，去秋經其至親蔡君（前曾在余處治愈同樣之疾患者）介紹來治，當囑田君內服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精治遺，而以「生殖素」補精强身，回復其性能，田夫人則內服「女用生殖素」以調經壯肌，外用「療帶靈」以凈脛去帶，夫妻同時依法自療，期甫匝月，所息均除，生殖腺充分健全，夫妻感情亦勝於新婚，最近蔡君見吿，云田夫人已懷孕多月云。</p>
<h3>除毒斷癮挽衰治病</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>患者馬君夫婦，染癮均久，最重毒深，迭次求戒，均以衰病湧現，痛苦萬狀，難奏全效，近以禁令迫切，始訪投來診，求安全戒煙，余即囑向太和藥房分別購服培補戒煙名劑男用女用「生殖素」以除毒斷癮，因「生殖素」挽衰治病之功效偉大確實，故服未一月，所患即治，重形壯健，毒除癮斷，安全戒煙，而馬君因同時注射「育維賜保命」以輔弼之，故彼不惟戒煙縮短，且迅速回復其健康云。</p>
<h3>遺精失眠安全戒煙</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>患者屠君，年四十七歲，當初因所業需漏夜工作，精神不濟，以致吸煙成癮，身日衰弱，癮重毒深，近二年來，時現遺精，更苦失眠，迭次求戒，均以不安中止，前月來診，囑向五洲藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」以治其遺精，而以「生殖素」治其失眠衰弱等症，精神頓覺復原，因「生殖素」兼有除毒斷癮之功，故連服半打，即吿安全斷癮，迅復壯健云。</p>
<h3>調經療帶發育乳房</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>女子身體如失健，則乳房萎癟不啻為其先兆，迨至月經不調，白帶纏綿，則身體之衰頹，已陷深淵，美態既喪，康健亦失，而生機汨滅，子嗣絕望矣，是故有恙者固當治其恙，如乳房萎癟者，更當速謀恢復其健美，亦挽回康健之切迫之圖也。</p>
<p>例如今春有薛夫人及劉女士者，劉女士因慊其乳峰萎癟，毫無健美，服「女用生殖素」後，即身壯體健，乳房豐腴，百病不侵，而薛夫人則早有乳萎之先兆，但昧未求治，以致月經不調，苦不堪言，後因白帶淋漓，始央薛君伴來求治，余當囑向中英藥房購服「女用生殖素」以調經强身，外用「療帶靈」以消炎凈　後，所患頓除，肌肉壯茁，乳部臀部，雙雙高聳，充分表現其少婦應具之曲線美，大受戚友所贊美。</p>
<h3>骨痛非輕症但亦非痼疾</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>吾人臨診統計，骨節笇痛病家甚多，其中且多遠年失治者，考其所以致此之由，蓋骨節痠痛患者，厥有二大謬誤之見解，其一在患者每以為本症乃不足介意之輕症，其二因患者往往以治療失當，經久難治，遂以本症為不治痼疾，職是之故，坐致病家患之而不注意，失治而即不再求治也，不亦謬之甚乎，夫骨節痠痛，初非輕症，不惟能使四肢麻木，失去靈活，肌肉痠楚，失去健爽，筋絡抽攀，失去舒暢全身瘓癱，失去自由，且患者排泄失常，尿酸過多，動脈硬化，易致爆裂，中風猝倒等禍暴起，豈不慘哉！</p>
<p>本症病源不一，非僅風濕內蘊，抑亦餘毒未凈，故治法當雙方並顧，乃患者每偏治其一端，以致無從根治，所謂不治之痛疾者，皆未明本症病源及治療常識所致耳，因記二例，以供患者借鑒，豈僅灌輸本症之常識而已哉！？</p>
<p>兼罹骨痛自須兼治</p>
<p>患者盧君，罹有精神衰弱症状至烈，迭試各劑，未有起色，腰背痠楚，儼然勞衰，體顫肢冷，困頓異常，今春來診，余診得盧君不惟生殖素缺乏，神經陷于極度衰弱，且風濕內蘊，餘毒未凈，兼罹有骨痛之症，非雙方兼顧不為功，當囑向五洲藥房購服「生殖素」以補充其生殖腺，挽救其衰弱，而以「强斯登氏骨痛片」袪其風濕，除其餘毒，連服半打左右，腰背即覺輕健，骨節亦感舒暢，多年沉疴，多年沉疴，一旦霍然盡除云。</p>
<p>久痛失治迅速根治</p>
<p>患者呂君，年四十八歲，安徽人，呂君罹骨痛垂二十載，迭服普通藥品，均難奏根治之效，以致痠痛時作，每逢節氣，更感痛苦，因循迄今，手足既形成麻木，身體更瘓癱不遂，近年來又罹遺精之苦，今春來治，經余囑向永安公司購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」根治其骨痛肢麻體癱等症，而以「希米脫氏固精片」治其遺精，並服「生殖素」以補其精血，回復其壯健，為期祗三旬左右，新恙舊疾，均得迅吿根治云。</p>

<h3>滑精（與）白濁（之）辨別法及其秘密有效自療法</h3>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>滑精與白濁，截然為兩種不同之病症，明其病理者固多，然未明其理之靑年亦不少，因邇來通函詢問者日必數起，故作本篇，以代總答覆。</p>
<p>按滑精乃性神經衰弱症之一，常由遺精早洩轉成而來，患者精關鬆弛，神經衰弱，故治法當服「希米脫氏固精片」以鞏固精關，而以「生殖素」挽救其性神經，至於白濁，病源係在淋菌作祟所致，故治法以殺菌凈濁為主，用藥以內服『安敵淋』為最效，如性能已遭摧殘，則「生殖素」亦為恢復性能對症要劑，白濁主凈，滑精主固，其最分明之點在此。</p>
<p>且滑精係精液受神經中樞刺戟所自行漏洩，而白濁則為一種膿性之分泌物，且白濁乃傳染性之性病，由不潔之性交染來，滑精乃由手淫，早婚，房勞，衰弱等因而來，其辦別法及用藥法既明，則患者當知自療之道矣。</p>

<p>遺精失眠</p>
<p>患者許君，年二十一歲，現寓塘山路，前月因遺精次數頻添，失眠健忘，痛苦難堪，自服「希米脫氏固精片」固精治遺，並服「生殖素」補精健腦後，所患霍然根治，不啻重生云。</p>
<p>陰痿性弱</p>
<p>患者孫君，年三十四歲，工界，孫君傷於早婚房勞，以致陰痿性弱，難行夫職，無從生育，自向永安公司購服「生殖素」後，服未半打，局部即發育逾于常人，性能亦健全勝昔，宛如再造云。</p>
<p>神經衰弱</p>
<p>患者杜君，年四十二歲，某洋行任事，杜君因秉賦薄弱，操勞過度，以致神經陷于極度衰弱，由詹念曾醫師施行電療，並段服「生殖素」後，神經回復繁榮，身體頓形壯實，精神煥發，雖逢大勞亦不倦云。</p>
<p>胃痛戒煙</p>
<p>患者周君，本地人年四十九歲，少時因胃痛難解，致吸煙成癮，迭求戒治，均難奏功，今夏由其同事吳君，吿以經騐，即服「胃痛靈」根治胃痛，而以「健胃素」調理之，並服「生殖素」以培補戒煙，期惟三旬，即克奏安全戒煙之奇功云。</p>

<p>— 姚爾昌博士詹念曾醫師合編</p>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（性病原理）遺精係精關鬆弛，無從自行約束所致，大都由手淫斵喪而起，故治法當固精補精並重，——早洩陰痿槪由早婚及房勞過度而起，故治法以培補其生殖腺及回復其性能為主，——由濁病源在淋菌之作祟，故治法以殺菌為主，——白帶有淋病性與非淋病性之分，治法淋病性者與白濁同，「安敵淋」主之，非淋病性者則可內服「女用生殖素」以健宮强身，外用「療帶靈」以凈　丟炎，——原理既明，更參攷用藥例，則療法自瞭然矣。</p>
<p>遺精頻仍　得救一例</p>
<p>患者施君，年廿四歲，少犯手淫，過于劇烈，以致精關鬆弛，釀成遺精夢洩等症，今春因次數頻添，體力難支，始來求治，除施行電療，割治包皮外，囑向中英藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」以治其遺精，而以「生殖素」補精强身，服未一月，即回復壯健云。</p>
<p>早洩陰痿　生育無望</p>
<p>患者李君，浙江人，年卅七歲，結婚過早，加以房事無節，致性能大遭毀傷，始感早洩，終成陰痿，生機喪失，難行夫職，結婚以來，迄無生育，去冬山至戚邵君介紹來診，為施電療，並囑向永安公司購服「生殖素」，連服五盒有奇，性能頓服壯健，最近承介紹其同居湯君來治同樣性病，言次得悉其夫人已懷孕多月云。</p>
<p>白濁淋漓　痛苦難堪</p>
<p>患者計君，本地人，年廿九歲，在二年前誤交部潔，致罹淋病，迭治失效，轉成慢性，炎症併發，險狀環生，淋漓纏綿，痛苦難堪，今春由共同居談君介紹來診，除為之施行電療洗滌等手術外，並囑向中西藥房購服淋痛名藥「安敵淋」，連服一月，炎症盡去，濁凈尿澄，毫無淋菌縱跡云。</p>
<p>白帶乳萎　回復健美</p>
<p>患者陸夫人，年卅左右，白帶纏綿，垂近七載，隱諱未治，以致身弱乳萎，失去健美，夏初因陸君所患性病治愈，始伴同來診，當囑內服「女用生殖素」外用「廖療帶靈」，期未一月，白帶即凈，乳部亦恢復健美之發育云。</p>

<h3>我國婦女的新舊觀</h3>
<p>— 剛</p>
<p>我國的婦女自古就受着男性的壓迫，而相沿成為通例，自五四運動以來，雖然有一部份受過敎育的婦女在力圖解放，從歐西把新的思想和趨勢搬運過來。然而能澈底認識和切實了解的，還是鳳毛麟角，至於舊式女子自然不懂得學問思想為何物，一味保守着相沿所謂三從四德的積習，這確是一件最大的憾事。但伊們也各有所長各有所短都有相當的利弊呢！</p>
<p>關於學識方面，不能不算新婦女占優勝。伊們旣受過敎育，——不論普通或高等敎育，——至少也能懂得家庭與社會的一點常識，對於一切迷信與不合科學的事理，便不致去信仰。餘如美術，工藝，交際，也是伊們的特長。因此對於人生觀，也覺得有一種濃厚的興味。舊式女子就不然：伊們因為沒有進過學校，見聞淺陋，所以一切新的聲（如音樂）色（如美術）一入她們的耳目，就有些不慣視聽。伊們不知地球有多大，一個縣城，一個市鎭，可以算伊胸中的世界了。這實在是舊式女子最大的缺點，也是所以不能和世界婦女並駕齊驅的主因。</p>
<p>家政一項，在表面上看來，似乎是新式婦女來得明白，但從實際上觀察，還是舊式女子能够措置裕如。這也不足怪，因為受過敎育的女子，一方面旣要求學業上的進步，另一方面又須顧到家庭的雜務，一身兩兼，自然就忽略不專了。而且伊們從學校中出身，一旦做了主婦，對於經騐上是很淺薄的。舊式婦女從小就訓練慣了，比較能耐勞勤苦，伊們視家政是自己應有的天職，不生厭惡之心，除此以外，腦中沒有別的想念了。</p>
<p>離婚，是現代社會上一個極重大的問題。考其原因大抵是受了不良環境的影響的緣故。舊式女子所以不會發生這項事者，一半是伊們沒有能力，沒有智識的工具，一半是伊們的慾望容易滿足，祗要丈夫能供給伊的衣食已算幸福了。不若新婦女的善於苛求。這樣一味的順從任男性隨意的虐待，被壓迫在强悍的權威之下，新婦女當然是不甘屈服的。然而新婦女的驕矜輕佻，目中無人，拿一點淺薄的學識卽聲言離婚，也是不足為訓的。</p>
<p>綜上面幾項比較起來，我們可以看出近代新舊婦女的一般，尚希伊們利其所長，去其所短，那才是婦女界的福音呢！</p>
<h3>動盪時期中的中國女性</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>新的基礎，尚未完全穩固，舊的機構，已被摧毀大半的中國女性，在這動盪時期之中，可說是處於最危險的地位。這是旅居在中國十七年，而於最近回英的華雷斯夫人，刋登在英國出版的紅星雜誌的對於中國女性的批評。這篇文章的題目，便是「動盪時期中的中國女性」。</p>
<p>她說，中國的女性，自解放以來，雖然也已有了十餘年的歷史，但是要用十餘年的時期，完全改造三千年來的堅固的婦女地位，那自然是不够的。所以中國的女性，在目前，在新的婦女運動史上，還不過是才只拉開着一個序幕。但是不幸得很，中國的女性，在這第一幕中，便遭遇到了一個重大的打擊。——這個打擊，也可說是中國女性的自己走進了歧途。因為中國女性，對於解放運動的口號，是「社交公開」，「職業自由」，「機會均等」，但是這些口號的作用，到結果，却完全變成了結婚的工具。在戀愛成熟的當兒，「社交」，「職業」，「機會」，……都自動地放棄了。雖然，這種現象，無疑地還是為了婚姻制度，為中國的三千年來的宗法社會所灌溉得根基太固，一般人對於婚姻那一個問題，視作為超於一切的大事，而這種遺毒，迄今尚是傳統地因襲着，但是中國人對於「男女問題」的敎育的幼稚，也是不能不尸其咎的。因為中國人的貞操觀念，還是保存着三千年來的畸形習慣，絕對的未因新興的婦女運動，而有所改進。這是在這動盪時期中，中國女性所處的最危險而可悲的地位。</p>
<p>華雷斯夫人，引證着在華目擊的一個故事。她說，有一位中國女士，會很努力於中國婦女的解放運動。她曾受過相當的敎育，她也曾供職於某商業機關。在一九二七年，與一位大學生，因戀愛而結婚了。結婚之後，她立卽把職業辭却，原因是她的丈夫，足够維持着她的生活。同時，她却也絕跡不上交際界了，原因是恐怕牠的丈夫，疑心着她有浪漫的行動。這麼着一年，她却因她的丈夫，發現了她在未結婚時的一個秘密，而把她遺棄了。雖然，到了一九二九年，得了一筆贍麥費，而正式離婚，但是她的名譽與地位，却便大受損害。她的父母兄弟，甚至於和她最親愛的一個姊姊，都和她斷絕了往來。同時，她也覺得自己是一個負罪極深的女子，甚麼都似乎已經完了。悲哀與憂鬱，按制着她的整個的心靈。在一九三一年，她的離婚綽的丈夫，又和別個女子結婚了，但她却在一九三二年上，經神錯亂了。在醫院中，住了二年，終於在一九三四年上死了。在她初離婚時，華雷斯夫人，曾極力的加以指導與勸慰，但她堅持着地位與環境之說，沒有向地位與環境奮鬥的勇氣，而終於把一切都犧牲掉了。</p>
<p>華雷斯夫人所說的，不過是婦女解放運動中的某一角，在實際上，在解放途中的陷阱，正是密密地排佈着。——我覺得在這動盪時期中的中國女性，若不能在敎育與思想的二方面，有充分的涵養與認識，而冒昧從事，比較起來，站在不穩固的新的基礎上，其危險更是重大呢！</p>
<h3>在非常時期中</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>－需要女警察－</p>
<p>最近上海市公安局，招考許多女警，有些人要覺得奇怪了，其實在外國是一件極平凡的事，在中國看來，確是破天荒第一遭。我們向來有一句話；「好人不當兵，好鐵不打釘。」但看這次投考人數，却有二百人之多，內中有高中畢業生，專科畢業生，初中畢業生為最多，小學畢業生次之，照這樣踴躍，眞出於一般人意料之外，豈不是打破了我們的根深蒂固的惡觀念嗎？</p>
<p>我們要知道，中國朝夕有强鄰侵入之禍，不論在什麽地方，在什麽時候，都處在非常時期中，任何人都應該武裝起來保衛國家。將來國家一旦有事，社會上維持治安，你想呌誰去擔任呢？那末，自然就需要我們受訓過的許多女警，出來負着維持地方秩序的責任。中國現在旣然處在非常時期中，對於自救的準備，當然急需積極進行。喂！你看：歐洲大戰的時候，德國所有的壯丁，差不多都去作戰了，社會的治安，都賴許多女警，蜴力負責，才和平常一樣，秩序井然，這樣看來，女警豈不需要麼？</p>
<p>我最後希望全國各省市，都有招考女警的需要，四家一旦有事，社會上的治安，就有許多女警，分別負責擔任，前方戰綫上的軍警，也無用再顧到後方社會上的治安，就可不分去作戰的實力，中國的需要女警，更不待言，願當軸者，努力推行，婦女踴躍投考，負起擔任非常時期女警的責任。</p>
<h3>敬致女界同胞</h3>
<p>— （席與琳）</p>
<p>－可作座右銘－</p>
<p>不要以為自己是一個婦人，不能與男子們同享權利和同盡義務的。</p>
<p>衣服要力求儉樸，不要打扮得妖豔動人，取悅於男子。</p>
<p>勿以為自己面貌美麗，而輕視男子，侮辱同性。</p>
<p>丈夫有困難的事情，做妻子的應為丈夫分憂。</p>
<p>病態美不算美，健康美方算美。</p>
<p>面孔上不要重塗脂粉，應當薄施脂粉，方不失去本來面目。</p>
<p>衣服應用國貨，但亦不可過奢。</p>
<p>做母親的對於子女們不要常常責駡，要施出「循循善誘」的手段。</p>
<p>關於硏討婦女問題的團體，都應自由加入。</p>
<p>似是而非的口紅與子彈二者之中你將把何者去報荅曾經對你有過太陽一般的熱情者。</p>
<h3>婦女在西班牙</h3>
<p>— 影天</p>
<p>由於西班牙的保皇黨及右翼共和黨的合力與左翼政府的作戰，西班牙遂墮入了不寗靜的境界，最近已發生好幾决猛烈的戰事；於是，便引起我對於正在解放的急進中的西班牙新婦女來了。</p>
<p>從帝制到共和，西班牙的婦女有着極速度的解放；雖然，伊們仍是喜歡古老的在鬢髮上揷着朶紅花兒，來表徵伊們女性的誘力；實際上，伊們無日不在各種活動裏面找取和男子們同等，甚至超過的競爭，因為，新立共和的憲章上規定伊們是具有獲取為國家社會服務的與男子有相等的機會，在某次的國會會員席上，就已經有着三位婦女了，從這一方面看，如果一旦西班牙全國國民選舉的時候，不知有多少婦女會當選代表來出現我們的目前，因為，上述的三個會員祗是國會中一部份男子所選。</p>
<p>記得有個呌做瑪牙里塔撒勒佛利亞的女子Sonorita　Margarita　Salaverria伊是西班牙婦女界第一個由考試而得到外交官的位置，這一聲打破西班牙歷史的霹靂，竟震驚了全國的男子，博得全國婦女們的欣喜同情。</p>
<p>完全是男子們淸一色的歷史研究會，第一個打進去的是西班牙各歷史家麥仙珠，卡白洛絲巴勒絲股羅司女士Mercedes　Cabrois　Ballesteros。</p>
<p>上述三項都是婦女們在政治上，文學上……所得的光榮的開始。而，西班牙婦女的體育是非常的興盛，瑪德里，雪米爾，巴陵西亞，巴雪郎那以及共他的城市，我們很可以找到伊們解放的資料，普通一個已嫁，或未嫁的女子，終可以瞧見伊們伸開了康健的手臂，在猛力地抽射着網球啦，棍球啦等等的球戲。而且，還有人提議伊們去和西班牙的鬥牛士作公開的比賽；於此，可見西班牙婦女的一斑了。</p>
<p>每一個太太，小姐，差不都很多是運動的名手。</p>
<p>唱着亞美利加編成的流行的情歌，茶館裏指揮着樂隊們奏着音樂，一切，都和男子們有着同樣的權利，値得讀揚的，奪榮的，西班牙解放中的新婦女啊！</p>
<p>可是，這一次西班牙的政變，也許會把伊們從命運裏進展到怎樣的一個環境呢？我，歌頌着西班牙婦女的努力。</p>
<h3>世界婦女消息</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>好萊塢的節儉運動</p>
<p>美國婦女的享樂，奢侈，似乎是世界馳名的，更其是電影明星們，似乎更獨具着揮金如土的習性。其實不然。美國婦女的享樂，奢侈，在實際上，僅限於職業的關係。一般婦女的愛好節儉，正和其他各國的婦女相仿。就是奢侈的中心好萊塢，現在也醞釀着很濃重的節儉的氣氛。在上個月間在離好萊塢五英里的一個茅立斯夫人公寓的門口，掛起了一個「好萊塢電影女從業員節儉大同盟一的招牌。辦事處設在該公寫的三樓，共佔着三個辦公室，和一個可容一百五十人的會議室。該大同盟的信條，是除却業務的關係之外，絕不作無謂之應酬，及享樂。加入者，已有三百人左右，均為好萊塢知名的女明星。主席是梅慧絲德。該同盟，尚擬於半年中，開辦消費合作部，和儲蓄與投資部。</p>
<p>蘇俄婦女的航空熱</p>
<p>航空一事，在蘇俄現正在突飛猛晋中。婦女們對於航空的興趣，比了男子更是濃厚。據調査，僅只莫斯科一地，連郊外的地域在內，能駕駛飛機的婦女，當在三千至四千之間。而職業的女飛行家，僅佔百分之六至八，其餘，均係業餘的飛行家。此輩女飛行家的職業分配，以服務於輕重工業界的居多。醫師及看護，也佔着相當的地位。農婦們最少。年齡的比例以一般而論，二十五至三十歲之間的，佔第一位。最年靑的，是僅六十七歲的孿生二姊妹。最老的，是莫斯科，里脫維夫斯基小學校校長脫里末區夫人，年五十八歲。飛行成績最佳的，是一位三十二歲的女醫師路爾夫人，會於今年三月間，在一個暴風雨之夜，獨自駕機往亞熟蕪海濱的一鎭集間，載一病人，於黎明之前，飛回莫斯科。得到了政府的名譽奬狀。</p>
<p>西歐婦女保護動物</p>
<p>保護動物的運動，本來是央國省創的。得女主維多利亞的贊助，得成績斐然。但在歐洲大陸，雖也有這個運動，但其成績，尙相差遠甚。最近，比利時與荷蘭的若干有地位的婦女，會屢次在比國的安脫完波城集議，擬將原有的保護動物會，加以整頓與擴展，並已向該二國的皇室，籌得巨額的基金，現正準備着作一番大規模的宣傳運動，並將請求二國的立法機關，立法而保護動物，使虐待動物的，與虐待幼童的，得到同樣的懲處。現該運動，有遂漸向東發展的趨勢。法瑞等國的婦女，在不久的將來，也將有强有力的保護動物運動，為動物造福，而發揚婦女所固有的母性之愛。</p>
<p>倫敦婦女的讀書會</p>
<p>倫敦的東區，在今年春間，新成立了一個「主婦讀書會。」潑起的主旨，是一般的家庭主婦們，每日為家事所累，儘有終年不讀一本書的。這對於自身的智識供養，旣有不足，且有日逐的趨於退步或落伍之虞。而同時，對於子女的敎育方面，自然也不能不給與相當的應響。所以這個主婦讀書會，便應運而生了。加入這個主婦讀書會的，年納會費五金磅，該會每隔十天，或半月，便借給名著一冊，限若干天讀完。（大致每天以習讀一時半，至二時為標準。）讀完之後，尚須作一報告，述說讀後的感想。這不啻是一種强迫讀書法，使加入該會的主婦，不能不每天撥冗一讀，其法至美。聞加入者，現已有二千人左右。其間有遠居在南菲，北美，上海，澳洲，和歐洲各地的會貝，的二百人。</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>醫學博士劉劍秋談家庭衛生</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>新家庭幸福的起點在那裏？有的人說：有了錢萬事滿足，也有人說：生了優秀的兒女，家庭纔有幸福，這話自有相當的道理，但金錢未必是家庭的幸福，有時因金錢作祟，反而造成黑暗恐怖的事變，可見余錢是靠不住的。我以為健康的生活，纔是快樂與幸福的起點。無論那一家，男女老幼，你傷我病，終年與藥石為伍，這是最最痛苦的。反之一家人個個身强力壯，做事的努力做事，讀書的奮發用功，內外一元化的為事業前途發展，這個家庭，我覺得是最快樂而最幸福的。講到道個問題，可算是最難辦到，不論父母子女，每個人都要講求淸潔，注重衛生，這句話大家會說，但怎樣去做呢？恐非經醫生指導不可。我前天和一位女醫師－劉劍秋博士曾討論到這些問題。她是江蘇邳縣人，金陵女大第一屆畢業生，留美六年，得密西根大學醫學博士學位，民國十四年返國，歷任上海西門婦孺醫院，定海醫院及杭州市立醫院產婦科主任，十八年起擔任人和醫院醫務主任兼高級助產學校敎務長，積十餘年的經騐，對於醫藥上的貢獻，當然很大，這裏把她的話紀錄下來，可供一般主婦的參考。</p>
<p>第一點對於醫藥方面的觀感：我自己雖是醫生，却不願侈談醫藥事業，因為中國人迷信太多，缺乏醫藥常識，對新醫沒有澈底的了解與認識。一個人生了病，請了醫生，往往不聽醫生的指揮，出了事，便埋怨醫生不盡責，這是多麽寃枉的事！在醫生方面，很少能研究病家的心理，彼此不相體念，也是失敗之因。新醫在中國，還是萌芽的時期，除都市外，農村裏至今還沒有受到新醫的恩惠，大概也有幾項原因：（一）新醫人數太少，不够分配，（二）內地生活極苦，交通阻梗，便是有醫生，病家總經不起遠道求醫；（三）農人積財不易，看錢自然很重，不知西藥之貴，譬如値五元的藥，要他三元，還以為太貴，把不得醫藥費全免，但事實上怎能辦到呢。所以我相信中國社會，必須運用政治的力量，推廣農村的公共衛生，獎勵科學的新醫；轉移人民的心理；新醫前途纔有可為。</p>
<p>第二點是婦女衛生：衛生兩個字，絕不易談，必先有了錢，纔能講衛生，你想人生四大需要，衣食住行，不都是須有充分經濟，纔能講究麽？現在大多數人生活也不易維持，那裏還談得上衛生？都市裏如此，農村不言而喻了。衛生無論男女，照理都要講究，可是中國的女人，數千年來受一切不平等的束縛，一向過牛馬式的生活，還配談到衛生？到了現在，婦女界智識已開，所處地位較好，才知道衛生是必須注意的。女子身體的構造，與男子有許多差別，故操勞不及男子耐久，這是天然吃虧的地方。又如纏足，束胸，都是女子最苦痛的事，然而現在內地農村，尚有未曾完全革除的。此種陋俗，予女子終生的痛苦，論其實質，比殺人更慘，這是婦女最不幸最不衛生的事，希望地方長官，認眞取締。婦女的衛生說來很簡單，我覺得比這更重要的，是家庭的幸福問題。一個家庭要上下一體的相親相愛相諒解，然目前最普通的弊病，是夫婦間不相關切，無愛情可言，有的因經濟貧困而夫婦反目，這是最可惜的。應該愈貧困愈要諒解，才有改善生活的可能。</p>
<p>第三是家庭的衛生常識：同樣一個家庭，城市與農村有許多不同的地方，日常生活，我以為農村比城市優美得多；譬如農村裏雖住的是茅屋，四周空氣新鮮，陽光充足，小孩每天受到十餘小時的陽光，而都市居民，蠖居鴿棚式的房子，陽光是不易射到的。吃是一家營養最重要的，農人有新鮮的菓子，菜蔬，維生素是最豐富的，而都市中人，平日所吃，大都不甚淸新，家庭衛生，原以飲食為最要，居室衣着次之，我國人的習慣，適得其反。常見上海市內的兒童，很多患脚氣病及佝僂病的，（卽軟骨病）小孩如此，成人可以想見，這便是飲食不衛生的佐證。一個主婦，對飲食先不講究，還談得到什麼兒童敎養麽？</p>
<p>第四是兒童衛生：兒童應聽其天然發展，撾分管束，反而不行，但他們一切生活所需，當然以淸潔為第一要義。可惜一般人家太不注意淸潔，最好使小兒不與細菌接近，不過一遇了細菌，卽生疾病，好像花房中的花草，平素不見日光，一見日光，立呈枯萎。而適應天然的環境的小兒，反有抵抗細菌的能力，但後者死亡率究比前者為高，所以折衷辦法，兒童不能過分管束，亦不能隨便放任，淸潔衛生，是必須講究的。都市裏中上級家庭，喜歡燃强烈的電燈，小孩睡了，依然電炬通明，殊不知强烈電炬，有傷小孩目光，甚至傷及神經，而有神經錯亂的危險，這些都不能大意忽略的。</p>

<h3>蕙姊（下）</h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>虧得錫生在當日他姊姊做親時，也曾見過這位姊夫一面，否則眞要懷疑自己走錯了人家了；然而人雖然認得，但瞧他那副好大的架子和一串挺高的喉嚨，便敎錫生呆住着不免道怎樣才好了。他眞懊悔自己為什麼不拚一頓打，挨在叔叔家裏不要出來呢？陳二少爺瞧他低着頭儘不說話，自然不耐煩多等的，便又像對付呌化子一樣地喝道：「你姊姊出去了，過一天再來吧！</p>
<p>這兩句話說完，彷彿他做姊夫的責任已盡，就一轉身回進去了；錫省却不能跟他進去負，再瞧旁邊兩個下人都扳着臉在那裏惡狠狠的看他，他怎麼還敢逗留呢？便忙着坑起了那斗大的包裹退出門去，將到走完末一級階沿石時，他的眼淚已掛在嘴角上了。</p>
<p>他從鄉下出發的時候，承他叔叔的好意，給他吃了一碗冷粥才動身，可是走了這麼許多的路，一碗冷粥早消磨凈了，五臟殿一鬧飢荒，他的腿便不知不覺地軟了下去，就在陳家左邊一家香燭舖的門檻上坐着不能再走了，幸而店裏的人也不驅逐他，讓他獨自獃在那裏。</p>
<p>好半嚮，從街的西面來了三輛黃包車，車上坐着三個女人中間的一個對於錫生似乎很面熟，要是蕙姊吧，但伊從前沒有怎樣漂亮啊！接着聽伊說話了，眞的是蕙姊，錫生不由興奮起來了，正想走上前去，一想却又不敢，只怕再像他姊夫一樣，何况自己和蕙姊從小儘吵架，伊也許比姊夫更不肯招留呢！這樣他就沒有勇氣了，眼睜睜的瞧着伊扶着一個老太太，打發過了車錢，帶着一個抱着小孩子的女下人一起走進陳家的牆門去了。錫生兩個眸子一直把伊送將進去，可是終究沒有勇氣喊出來。</p>
<p>蕙姊現在是回來了，能不能再進去試試看呢？錫生把這個問題盤算了好久，始終不能决定，而且自己的肚子又不能一天不裝東西啊！生存的問題便把這個十七歲鄉下孩子困住了。最後他覺得最妥當的辦法，還是趕快走回鄕下去，假托姊夫家搬了塲，找不到，再在叔叔家裏挨幾時。他差不多要站起來走了。陳家門口裏忽出了那個瞥門的下人來，伸着頭向四處張望，像是找入的樣子；後來見到了錫生，便忙着奔過來問道：</p>
<p>「你就是方才從鄕下來的舅少爺嗎？」</p>
<p>錫生也不知道他自己是不是舅少爺，只應了一聲「我是鄉下來的。那下人便隨手替他提起了那包裹，重復再把他引進陳家，錫生想總是姊夫見姊姊回來了，所以敎人來找我，可是一進門，只見那站在大廳前的却不是那凶狠的姊夫，而是從小儘和他吵嘴的蕙姊！</p>
<p>一見面，姊弟倆不覺都哭了，偉大的手足之愛，在貧富懸殊的情况下，終於很充分地表顯出來了。</p>

<p>九，問病以內科，皮膚花柳科為限。</p>
<p>四肢腫痛</p>
<p>第一號　南京四條巷任星五君問：敝人身體素來健康，十八年來未嘗有病。乃二十日前忽然發熱，同時左手肘腕，膝，踝等處發熱紅腫，動動痛澈心隨。曾請某花柳醫生診治，謂是淋病起的關節炎。敝人自問素日潔身自好，絕無尋花問柳之事，後自服『凡拉蒙』，『阿斯披材』等，十餘日全愈。乃愈未數日，今又發作，比前次更甚。請問（一）是否『淋病關節炎』？（二）未曾尋花問柳亦有本病發生否？（三）如是以用何種療法為佳，『凡拉蒙』，『阿斯披林』可服否？（四）敝人發熱之外又覺苦悶，是否『火向裏攻』？、（一）恐非『淋濁性關節炎』，而為『急性多發性關節痺』，本病日本名『僂麻質斯』，英名“Rheumatic　Fever”有單週期，複週期，持久性三種，尊恙恐即屬複週期的。（二）不會。（三）『凡拉蒙』及『阿斯披林』對於痺症有效，但既經請再診治，曾經診查之結果較通訊詢問可靠，以再請可靠醫師診查一次為是。痺性之特效藥有『息爾風』（SinoPhAn）注射內服均可。（四）『火』字太帶玄學色彩，下次通信請勿用此種字眼。痺熱極能惹起心筋炎，心頭苦悶大有心筋炎之可疑，此病能起瓣膜閉鎖不全之遺後症，以速診治為是。</p>
<p>答覆後覺尙有請閣下注意之點，即（一）修養，最好絕對安靜，臥床不動，患部用棉花，（乾濕皆可）包纏，（二）飲食以流動體，牛乳，半生雞蛋，粥，湯為宜，（三）多飲冰，每日可飲熱水瓶（一磅裝）五六瓶。（四）最好住院。</p>
<p>小孩怪病</p>
<p>第貳號　北平絨線胡同塔斌君問：敝人有一小兒今年五歲（實年四歲）由打生下來到現在，就沒長過個兒。牙也沒生。一直到今年纔生了兩個半個，一個是第四左門牙，一個是下列第三右門牙。所以說是半個，就因為凹凹凸凸的，樣子很不像個牙。到現在還不會走，大人扶着走一走也是歪歪拐拐，不像個走路的樣子。骨頭很細，好像皮和骨頭之間沒有肉是的。可是喫可還是喫得不少。前些時候因為肚子大，請着名的專門治痞的大夫瞧過，也沒說出所以然來，喫藥也沒見效。聞說先生高明，這種病不知也治得好治不好。</p>
<p>答：塔先生過獎了。您這信寫很這麼明瞭，在我這裏每日所接到的信中是絕無儘有的。令郎的病這樣奇怪（其實也不奇怪，天下沒有奇事，塔先生少見聞罷了），實在引起我們很大的興趣。我很願意詳細的答覆你。怕北平看不到附刋，特再寄一份給你。『佝僂病』這名字你聽見過罷？令郎就是這種病。這病的原因是缺乏『維他命　』和『　』。病狀是不必說了，就和你說的一樣。你當然希望治好他，請你買『海力命』（Hailimin）給他喫，喫到後來你會覺得奇怪『唉！這病也醫得好嗎？』能同時服『新亞鈣劑』（Sinocalcin），補足體內的鈣質更佳。</p>
<p>氣不通順</p>
<p>第三號　李劍魂君問：敝人今年十八歲，母親，姨母，舅舅，姑母都因肺癆死。敝人自幼營養不良，記憶力薄，咳嗽，多走幾步珞就喘，飯喫得很少，人很瘦，手脚終年冰冷。這都不要緊，最痛苦的是氣不通順，每三四個月就發作一次，發起來坐不安，立不穩，啼笑皆非，臉通紅，紅中透紫，頸上像有人捏着一樣，呼吸非常困難，同時咳嗽，吐濃痰。每一次發作非一星期不好。（一）不知這輩子還能好不能好了（由五歲到現在）（二）多喫點飯就會發作，餓一天，或喫點酸的就輕些，不知是怎樣一回事？（三）我們先生說是喘，不知是不是？（四）用什麼醫，醫得好嗎？</p>
<p>你的病呌做『氣管枝性喘息』，是一種特異體質病，以後注射『血淸』，用『砒』，『腎上腺』，注射『撒爾發散』等都要特別注意。原因為『貧血』，『虛弱』，『鼻炎』，『扁桃腺肥大』等，不知你有這些病沒有？有的先須治好，始可言治本病。（一）本病在你這種年齡如能治癒，則終身可不再發，否則有成終身病的可能。（二）過食是本病誘因，酸類有治本病之效力。（三）是。（四）用『麻黃素』（Ephedrin），一日三次，每次一片，每次隔六小時，有效，其餘如『百咳定』（Pacdin），『咳利舒開』（Kresocal）可服，是否能完全治癒不是藥物問題，而是衛生問題。即原因病能否治癒，冷暖能否注意，飲食能否當心，環境能否改變是。</p>
<p>飯後腹痛</p>
<p>第四號　余甲君問：（一）飯後一二小時臍上痛痛，如灼如刺是否胃病，抑是腸病？（二）服『胃寶』如何？（三）大便黑色，不知可與飲濃茶有關？（四）用何藥治療為宜？（五）先生可治本病否？（六）有危險否？</p>
<p>（一）是胃病，是『胃潰瘍』！（二）不知該藥成份不敢批評。（三）否，是潛在性出血，亦胃潰瘍之一症狀。（四）可服『的是開胃』（Biscama），但藥物療法是其一部分，衛生療法應同時注意。（五）可。（六）於生命無危險，但難愈。</p>
<p>記憶力薄</p>
<p>第五號　張義君問：敝人自幼家貧，苦讀，十七歲時已有記憶力薄之症，丟三忘四，幾能常事，自己放置之物品，不旋時即不知何往，各處找尋，結果還在手邊。讀書不能理解，尤其是對外國文，非常困難。好作幻想，所想大抵於本人無益，但偏不能自止；在讀書時未及半頁，神心早不知何往矣。又多夢，惡夢頻來，醒後即不知何往。請問（一）是否神經衰弱？（二）敝人好看醫學書，越看越似自己之病，心炙如焚？（三）以前所服藥物已不計其數，但有效者未嘗有，請先生指示一種常服藥。</p>
<p>（一）是。（二）此為最不好之現象，最好拋棄此類書籍，並不再回憶其中言語，對於自身之病亦不放置心上，須知此病非不可治之疾病。（三）可常服『賀爾賜保命』（Hormspermin）。市上許多所謂補腦藥，類多含有　劑，不但無效，反而有害。本病的藥物療法本在第末位，最重要者為環境改變，拋學競業。以本人之意見，以為職業前途與讀書之關係甚少。把一本書讀完，全記在腦筋中，其智識亦不過限於此本書。書之與實用相距若干，固無論矣，即與事實相符，則所用到者有幾？書呆子而見客不能一語者，吾見之矣。熟讀天方夜譚，而不能與西人交一語，或讀一段大陸報者，吾見之矣。在吾以為，君如係學社會科學者，宜體會人生，代替心理學，社會學，君如係學自然科學者，注意實騐，科學之基礎在實騐，多讀書更無用。</p>
<p>說得太多了，與題目越距越速，就此而止。君如再有疑問，通函或面談，余願盡余之所知指導閣下。</p>
<p>是否懷妊</p>
<p>第六號　馮薛玉如夫人問：敝人自去年與外子結褵後，直至前三月忽然經閉，屢感頭暈，四肢乏力，並好喫酸物，而不覺其滋味，（一）請問是否懷姙？（二）應如何調養？（三）抑是病？</p>
<p>夫人此篇之問出敝醫師之限制（此是，產科之問題，敝人以內科，皮膚花柳科為限）之外，此次破例答覆，下不為例：（一）所叙症狀是姙娠之不確徵，不能斷為是否懷姙，確實之方法為檢尿（各醫師處均可，為價二十元左右）。再經閉已有三月，如是懷姙，經此時候，腹部已有小兒心音可聽。（二）應調養之事繫多，限於篇福，不能一一答覆，確定後尋專門醫師徵詢可也。（三）如（一）之診斷法呈陰性則係病。</p>
<p>是否梅毒</p>
<p>第七號　孫占鰲君問：敝人為損友所誘，朝夕出入賣笑者之門，在今春患淋濁並在陰莖底端生一肉圓柱，診治全癒，其後騐血，並無梅毒，無如近患頭暈，頭痛，腰酸，四肢無力，喉痛，渾身痛，胸部又發紅點，但未經治療即退。（一）請示此是何病？（二）用何法治療？（三）須費幾何？</p>
<p>（一）大有梅毒之嫌疑，一次騐血而無毒不盡可靠，蓋在初期硬結時，騐血往往陰性，為解釋疑團計，最好再騐一次，（注意，注射治梅服藥後一個月內檢查亦不可靠）。（二）如係梅毒當用驅梅療法，注射『阿斯凡納明』足五公分，（同時注射『鉍治梅毒』（Bismudol）或『尅爾梅星』（Carbisin）滿足五公分時，停一個月，再騐血一次。如係陽性，須再加療治，如係陰性，尙不足代表為全瘉之徵，半年後宜再騐血一次。（三）醫師各有診例，各不相同。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>請韓主席目光放大些</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>據濟南電，魯取締奇裝異服，嚴厲執行，一日韓復榘親抓奇裝異服婦女三人，公安局亦續捕五十餘人，均押軍法處侯辦，蓋奇裝異服的女子，招搖過市，誘惑靑年，確可取締，並且韓主席取締奇裝異服的女子，不啻三令五申，嚴厲制止，乃仍有奇裝異服的女子，招搖過市，弁髦法令，為韓主席親手拿獲，該女子咎有應得，亦既可知。</p>
<p>惟女子喜歡漂亮，喜歡美觀，喜歡時髦，亦是婦女的普通性，故此種奇裝異服，招搖過市的女子，雖比不上從前一般讀過「閨門訓，女兒經」只知三從四德的女子，然亦並不犯在現代潮流中甚密不法的行為，因為現在的潮流，去「異言必禁，異服必誅，」的年代時期太遠也。</p>
<p>並且現在的所謂奇裝異服的女子，都從歐化中來，不過中國女子不爭氣，不學歐洲婦女的精神，而專學歐洲婦女的皮毛，更不爭氣而做我國孱弱國家的國民老婆子女，而不做歐美富强的國家的國民老婆子女，致被當局認為是妖孽，是魔障，是敗壞善良的風俗，而把國家的一切不幸事件，多要推在奇裝異服的女子身上，眞是冤枉。</p>
<p>但是我不作這樣的觀念，我認為這種奇裝異服的女子，應該去吃官司，應該去受罪，無論其奇裝異服，雖在國民政府現行法上，並不犯着任何刑事處分，但若輩弁髦韓主席的法令，應該去嘗試嘗試鐵窗風味，蓋一地方當局的法令，無殊乎國家的法令，住居該地的人，固應有服從地方當局的法令義務，韓主席既有禁令於前，而該地女子，不肯遵守，不但家中奇裝異服，竟敢奇裝異服，招搖過市，宜乎與共黨盜賊等同其嚴重，欲受軍法官之裁判也。</p>
<p>一省之長官，負一省的重任，當深識大體，不必毛舉細故，若抓婦女於途，干涉穿衣於市，此非一省主席的行為，是一般役吏所有事也，魯省擺在眼前的，有一極大的困難問題，亦是魯省的生死存亡問題，韓主席必須以枕戈待日的精神，前去應付，蓋地方長官的責任，何等重大，其犖犖大者，衛國有責，守土有責，保民安民有責，此種地方，韓主席不應輕易放過，應該用不屈撓，不遷就，不敷衍，不合作，的精神來對付，方能謂之國家柱石，國家棟樑，至於婦人女子之服，可以不必勞主席的貴手，煩主席的淸神，所謂豺狼當道，安問狐狸，若但問狐狸，不問豺狼，此之謂重其所輕，而輕其所重，韓主席若果知此義，則此種謹小慎微之事，恐亦無暇及此矣。</p>

<h3>Political Council Decides to Issue Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds; Original Proposal by Minister Kong; Principles Approved by the Political Council</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council decided to issue 120 million yuan of Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds for the 25th year of the Republic, and submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for review on the 4th. President Sun immediately approved the submission to the Finance Committee for examination. The original proposal by Minister Kong for the issuance of these public bonds is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Guangdong currency consolidation case, the Ministry has already submitted a report on the handling situation for review. It is now found that the amount of subsidiary currency issued in Guangdong, as of mid-July of this year, that can be accounted for, has reached a huge sum of 249.58 million yuan. However, all cash reserves only amount to 100.745 million yuan of current subsidiary currency, accounting for approximately 43% of the issued amount. According to the legal 60% cash reserve requirement, there is still a shortage of more than 42.29 million yuan of current subsidiary currency, accounting for slightly less than 17% of the issued amount. Under the guarantee reserve item, there are only 91.46 million yuan of Guangdong currency system consolidation treasury bonds and subsidiary currency. Although these treasury bonds are designated to use the provincial treasury income and provincial military reclamation factory income as collateral, there is no definite amount as a fund for repaying principal and interest. The total shortage of subsidiary currency in cash and guarantee reserves amounts to more than 140 million subsidiary currency. This shortage should be made up to stabilize the credit of subsidiary currency and stabilize social finance. Previously, Guangdong Province failed to implement central laws and abused the issuance of subsidiary currency, causing great suffering to the people of Guangdong. Now that Guangdong's administration is unified, the central government, mindful of Guangdong Province's past enthusiasm for supporting the revolution, should first unify the currency system to seek economic revival in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Guangdong. Even in this time of extreme difficulty for the national treasury, we must try to find a solution and plan to allocate funds from the unified tax collection in the Guangdong area to issue 120 million yuan of Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds for the 25th year of the Republic to offset the shortage of reserves to comply with the law and stabilize finance.</p>
<p>The principles for issuing the Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds for the 25th year of the Republic, as approved by the Central Political Council, are as follows: (1) Bond amount: 120 million yuan in national currency; (2) Purpose: To consolidate Guangdong's finances and replenish the subsidiary currency reserves; (3) Issue date: October 1, 1936; (4) Interest rate: 4% per annum, with interest paid twice a year on March 31st and September 30th; (5) Term: 30 years, with principal repaid twice a year on March 31st and September 30th. The principal will be repaid at 3% per year for the first 20 years and at 4% per year for the next 10 years, with all principal and interest paid off by September 30, 1966; (6) Funds: Allocated from the unified tax collection in the Guangdong area, the Ministry of Finance will order the Tax Affairs Administration to allocate the amount of principal and interest due each month according to the principal and interest repayment schedule to the Central Bank's National Debt Fund Management Committee's public bond account for special storage as a reserve for payment.

<h3>Smuggled Goods Flood Tianjin Market</h3>

<h3>Measures for Suspending Income Donations from Civil Servants; National Government Orders All Agencies to Comply</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee previously passed four measures for suspending income donations from civil servants when the government implements income tax: (1) When the government implements income tax, the central government will stop collecting income donations; (2) Funds originally paid from the income donation item, except for those already included in the 25th-year national budget, all party member and martyr pension funds will be paid by the national treasury in the future. Other items, such as subsidies for domestic and foreign students, temporary subsidies, cultural support fees, and savings deposits for staff of this ministry, will be compensated by an annual allocation of 700,000 yuan from the national treasury. All necessary preparations will be handled separately by the Central Executive Committee and the Ministry of Finance according to the plan; (3) Income donations owed by various agencies before the government implements income tax will still be collected by the Ministry of Finance and handed over to the central government in full; (4) The staff originally handling income donations for the central government will all be transferred to the Ministry of Finance to handle income tax to utilize their expertise. This was transferred to the National Government by the Central Executive Committee through the Central Political Committee. When the Income Tax Ordinance is promulgated and implemented, the first three items of the measures will be ordered to be followed. The National Government has now issued a special order to all directly subordinate agencies to instruct their subordinates to comply with the first three items of the measures, as the Provisional Income Tax Ordinance has been officially promulgated and implemented.

<h3>All Rivers Within Hebei Province Can Celebrate Safe Embankments</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Xu Shida, Chief Engineer of the North China Water Conservancy Commission, the water level of all rivers within Hebei Province this year can be said to have celebrated safe embankments. Although there was an increase in water before the White Dew season, it will not cause disasters. However, the Hai River's silting effect on the Yongding River is causing the riverbed to rise daily, and the commission is paying close attention to this. It is currently preparing for the silting project at the Jinmen Sluice Gate and is scheduled to start construction in October. The construction projects of the Chahar provincial government will also continue simultaneously according to the original plan, and drilling work will also continue. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The North China Water Conservancy Commission's fundamental projects for the Yongding River, such as the construction of the Guantington Reservoir and the Jinmen Sluice Gate silting project, remain unchanged and will start in October. Funds are available and can be paid at any time upon approval by the commission. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A total of 300,000 yuan is allocated for the Yongding River's Jinmen Sluice Gate silting and repair of the Lugouqiao Flood Diversion Dam projects. Construction will start in October and is scheduled to be completed within three months. The 300,000 yuan has been allocated by the commission. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

Furthermore, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared this afternoon that the cabinet ministers have already planned the position that Japan will take.

<h3>The Legend of the Peace Agreement Between Britain, the United States, and France</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>In March of this year, the London Naval Agreement was established. The trend of mutual cooperation between Britain, the United States, and France in international politics has gradually become apparent. Recently, the international war crisis in Europe and the Far East has become increasingly acute. Maintaining peace is becoming increasingly difficult. The legend of the informal peace agreement between Britain, the United States, and France is thus emerging. According to reports from New York financial circles at the end of last month, the three governments want to maintain peace and eliminate trade barriers and are considering concluding an informal agreement, with the British government being the most active. The main purpose of the agreement is to eliminate significant trade barriers between the three governments, encourage other countries to take similar actions, and prevent war through informal meetings when war breaks out, or to localize the war so that it does not spread. Living in the Far East, given the fruitless discussions of the Pacific Society and the Washington Treaty expiring in four months, while the forces of aggression are adopting a strategy of individually breaking up the forces of peace, we cannot help but regard it as a welcome thing to hear that these three major powers representing the forces of peace have the possibility of working together, regardless of the authenticity of the rumors.</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, and France have the same interests and hopes in this world crisis. There is no difference between them in maintaining the status quo and preventing aggression. Moreover, their domestic political systems all maintain a democratic system and are not subject to the domination of fascism or extreme communism. Some say that the only way to avoid the bankruptcy of world civilization is to rely on the efforts of these three countries. However, the reason why the three countries cannot cooperate and fight is that the economic war has not been eliminated, the political prejudice is difficult to eliminate, and the center of gravity of interests is not consistent. The tariff war, currency war, and overseas market war between Britain and the United States are very fierce. Between the United States and France, since the war, either quotas have been implemented to restrict American goods, or war debts have been extorted, raising tariff barriers so that French goods have no possibility of selling well in the United States. After the economic crisis of 1929, the currency war became more acute. To make the three countries work together, this obstacle must first be eliminated. Fortunately, the world economy is gradually improving, and the US diplomatic authorities are no longer adhering to the prejudice of high tariffs. A peace agreement may be possible under these circumstances.</p>
<p>As for political prejudice, the United States is the most serious. At this Pacific Society meeting in Yosemite, the French representative believed that the failure of the Pacific collective system was due to the United States. The greatest prejudice of the United States is that it is unwilling to implement sanctions. It isolates itself and is unwilling to bear international obligations. If there were no such prejudices, Japan would not be a threat, and Germany and Italy would not dare to act recklessly. Moreover, the center of gravity of Britain's interests lies in the line from Europe to India, the center of France's interests lies in Central Europe, and the United States pays attention to the Far East. Their focal points are not consistent. In the past, the United States could not restrict Japan, France could not make Germany comply, and Britain could not sanction Italy. All this was because they did not care about the urgency of others in peacetime. When difficulties come, friends of the past also stand by and watch. Now, the aggressive actions of Germany, Italy, and Japan have made British, American, and French politicians have considerable awareness. It is not too late to make amends. Maintaining peace depends on the peace forces uniting. I hope that the leaders of the three countries will live up to the desire of world pacifists.</p>
<h3>Provisional Measures for Punishing Bandits During the Bandit Suppression Period</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission believes that the original term for the implementation of the provisional measures for handling bandit cases during the bandit suppression period was one year. It is now about to expire, but the military operation of bandit suppression has not yet ended. It is not sufficient to cope with the situation if it is not extended. It has now been revised and renamed Provisional Measures for Punishing Bandits. In addition to publishing it as a commission order to ensure continuity, it has been submitted to the Central Political Council for review. It is now known that the Central Political Council has approved the record. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Western Rebel Army Advances Like a Bamboo Split; Y伦 City is Captured; The Champion Fights Bravely but Ultimately Succumbs; San Sebastian is Also Feared Difficult to Hold for Long</h3>
<p>Piaabi - Spanish rebel forces captured Y伦 City today, immediately using knives and hand grenades to attack the defending forces. Fierce street fighting broke out, and the defenders surrendered due to lack of support. Thus, another important town in northern Spain has fallen. With the loss of this city, the wealthy port of San Sebastian is left with no defensible position, and the Spanish government forces' northwestern sea route is about to be cut off. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Andaye - The northeastern fortress of Y伦 City, belonging to the Spanish government forces, was besieged by rebel forces for two weeks, followed by three days of intense fighting, resulting in hundreds of casualties on both sides. It was finally captured by the rebel forces today. At noon, the attacking rebel forces reached the center of the city. The main road leading to the border is still passable, allowing the remaining government forces to retreat. The defenders in the city have only a few machine gunners left, relying solely on the already burning houses as their only means of defense, and have vowed to fight to the death rather than flee or surrender. The rebel forces advanced in the city, using tanks and armored vehicles for cover. It is said that the rebel forces fought hard to capture the village of Beobia last night in order to remove the last obstacle to attacking Y伦. Although the defenders fiercely resisted with machine guns and rifles fired from the windows of houses along the way, the rebel forces fearlessly advanced step by step through the hail of bullets. The attacking rebel forces used Moroccan troops and foreign legions as their vanguard. While the government forces in the village of Beobia were desperately resisting, another rebel column bypassed the village and attacked Y伦. Subsequently, the defenders of Beobia finally collapsed and retreated, and the entire village was occupied by the rebel forces. Now that Y伦 City has fallen, San Sebastian is feared to be difficult to defend for long. It is said that the rebel forces are planning to begin an offensive. San Sebastian was originally a famous summer resort in Spain. Now, its land transportation has been cut off, and it is constantly subjected to aerial bombardment, transforming it into a terrifying hell. Several rebel warships are currently patrolling the coastal area of San Sebastian, preparing to open fire to provide assistance when the land offensive begins. If San Sebastian falls, the rebel forces can concentrate in the coastal cities west of the city, which are still held by government forces. Santander and Bilbao are also among them, as most of the country's military material factories are located within this region, making its gain or loss extremely significant. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Andaye City, Southern France - Special dispatch from our correspondent: The Northern National Army of Spain has recently occupied Y伦. Under the cover of tanks and machine guns, the National Army advanced to the central area of the city at 9:00 this morning. Many houses were hit by bullets and caught fire, with flames raging throughout the city, making it impossible to approach. The complete fall of Y伦 City is imminent. The National Army made preparations last night and launched an attack along the Saint Martial to Y伦 City Avenue at dawn today. Their military equipment is far superior to that of the government forces, and they are advancing steadily, like a bamboo split. At the same time, another team rushed down from a high point near Y伦 City. The government forces were attacked from both sides, making them even more unable to withstand the assault. However, many members of the militia are brave individuals who had previously sworn to fight to the death. Although defeated, they are only willing to sacrifice themselves.</p>
<p>As for Beobia, another small town in the north, it is also surrounded by the National Army. Although the sound of gunfire has not ceased, the National Army has likely already controlled the town. Several hundred residents of Y伦 City have fled to this place since 6:00 this morning, gathering near the train station. Among them, soldiers belonging to the regular army and the militia are wearing blue workers' uniforms, covered in mud, and mostly looking dejected, without a single smile. As for the residents of the war zone, thousands have sought refuge in France in recent days. When leaving, they try to carry as many essential household items as possible. Those who are too heavy to carry are destroyed to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy. Many children have been separated from their families in the displacement, wandering the streets, crying out for their parents. Parents are also searching for their children everywhere, making it heart-wrenching to hear. Coupled with the bad weather, with fine rain, the scene is even more tragic. The fighting around Y伦 City has ended. Although the port of San Sebastian and the ports along the Atlantic coast are still in the hands of the government forces, they have been isolated from the French border, and their situation is also precarious. Furthermore, according to a special dispatch from our correspondent in Burgos City, the Northern Command of the National Army has now drafted a plan to prepare for an offensive against the ports of San Sebastian and Bilbao, and troops will likely be deployed at any moment. (Havas Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Andaye City - Special dispatch from our correspondent: Street fighting broke out in Y伦 City, northern Spain, at 10:00 this morning. Although the militia belonging to the government forces are still desperately defending the city's outposts, the outposts in the town of Beobia have been occupied by the fascist Carlist party troops. Our correspondent personally witnessed dozens of militiamen stacking mattresses to form obstacles, using two machine guns to strafe the foreign legion and Moroccan soldiers belonging to the National Army. However, from the banks of the Bidasoa River on the border to the outskirts of Y伦 City, all areas are filled with National Army troops. Many of the government forces are hiding in civilian houses, constantly opening fire to hinder their advance. At this time, many houses in the city have been hit by bullets and are burning, with thick smoke rising everywhere. In addition, our correspondent also witnessed a militiaman fearlessly tearing down the Republican flag hanging high on the roof of the Y伦 City Hall, rolling it around the flagpole, and holding it tightly to his chest, showing his unwillingness to let it fall into the hands of the National Army. It can be said that their resentment is intense. (Havas Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Great Chaos in Y伦; Fires Light Up the City; Refugees Flee to France in Despair; The Scene of Families Separated is Tragic</h3>
<p>Andaye - This afternoon, a total of ten houses in Y伦 City caught fire and burned. When the burning buildings collapsed, large amounts of debris flew into the air, and the towering church spires were also heavily burned. The entire valley was shrouded in black smoke. After the rebel forces entered Y伦 City, fierce street fighting resumed because a small part of the government militia was still holding out. It was very clear from the border. The militia placed machine guns behind sandbags and launched a fierce strafing attack on the attacking foreign legion. Another thirty government soldiers hid behind another obstacle and fought bravely against the enemy. It is said that there are many houses in the city with explosives buried in them, all of which were detonated when the rebel forces entered the city. According to unconfirmed news, the government forces executed many hostages using high-voltage wires before withdrawing. It is said that Bishop Della Torre also suffered this fate. Traffic between Y伦 and San Sebastian was interrupted in the afternoon. Many of the defenders are still holding out near the international bridge, using machine guns to strafe the enemy. The rebel forces occupied the city hall during the fighting. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>The refugees who fled from Y伦 to the French border today were in a very miserable state, carrying as many of their belongings as possible. There were two young girls carrying a birdcage, which still contained a hibiscus bird. The weather was unfavorable, with incessant overcast rain, which made the refugees even more miserable and sick. When passing through the border, many children were separated from their parents and were crying sadly. Many refugees had too much clutter at home to carry conveniently, and many destroyed it themselves, preferring to sacrifice everything rather than have it used by the rebel forces. The French authorities are now distributing all the refugees to various towns and cities in southern France. Currently, Andaye alone has gathered more than 5,000 refugees, many of whom swam across the Bidasoa River to France under the hail of bullets. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Forces Exert All Their Strength to Attack the City of Beobia; With the Loss of This Barrier, Y伦 is Difficult to Defend</h3>
<p>Andaye - This afternoon, the Spanish rebel forces began to attack the city of Beobia on the Spanish-French border. Without taking this city, there is no hope of capturing Y伦 City. At 4:45 p.m., 1,500 infantrymen from the rebel side launched their first fierce attack on the city from the slopes of Mount Labencia, with Moroccan troops and foreign legions as the vanguard. As the foreign legions advanced, they threw grenades along the way. The defenders resisted with machine guns, with bullets raining down. After about fifteen minutes, the rebel forces finally reached the outskirts of the city, but many of their leaders were killed. Because the defenders were mostly hiding in houses, firing fiercely from the windows, while the attacking troops had no cover when they rushed forward, they only relied on their large numbers to advance quickly to reach their destination. At dusk, the fighting became even more intense. Everything along the avenue along the Bidasoa River was swept away by fierce artillery fire. The defenders crouched behind obstacles and sandbags, using machine guns and rifles to fire at the foreign legions who were trying to occupy the bridgehead over the river. Late tonight, the rebel forces, using the power of machine guns, advanced to a location within 400 yards of the international bridge. In addition to braving the hail of bullets from the government forces' machine guns, they were also subjected to continuous rifle fire from the upper-story windows of the houses. Then, the rebel artillery began to shell the unoccupied parts of Beobia, causing two shells to land on the tracks near the Andaye train station, but they did not explode. However, one shell hit a match factory, which burned fiercely in an instant. Another stray bullet cut the city's electricity wires, plunging the entire city of Beobia into darkness. The sound of bullets whistling through the air was incessant on the avenue within the French border, causing local residents to close their windows tightly. At the same time, the sound of grenades exploding was also heard on the avenue connecting Y伦 and San Marcial. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Town of Beobia on the Franco-Spanish Border - This afternoon, Spanish rebel artillery and aircraft fiercely bombarded Y伦 City and the Fontarabia Fortress, continuously causing tremendous losses. The sky was filled with smoke, covering the advance of the rebel forces. The troops, including Carlist restorationists and Moroccan foreign legions, were making slow but fierce progress. Armed combatants from the People's Front were desperately defending every inch of land, digging trenches in the fields to resist with rifles and machine guns, and would not give up until the very end. At the time of writing this dispatch by the Havas News Agency correspondent, bullets were flying through the streets of Beobia, France, with a whistling sound. The town of Beobia on the western side is still in the hands of the government forces, but it is in imminent danger of being captured by the rebel forces at any moment. At 8:30 p.m., sixty-six government soldiers crossed into French territory and were disarmed and accommodated. Looking through a telescope at dusk, our correspondent glimpsed the rebel demolition team throwing explosives at the last line of defense held by the government forces. The government forces fled through the wheat fields. The reporter personally witnessed one of them being slightly delayed in his escape, and his head was immediately blown off by the explosion. The horrifying scene of the battlefield can be seen from this. The rebel forces continued to advance without stopping. Beobia seems to be indefensible, but a few government soldiers are still putting up a last-ditch resistance. Many of the rebel rifles and machine gun bullets landed in France, causing great panic among the French people. Marcant, the prefect of the Lower Pyrenees province of France, has lodged a strong protest with the rebel headquarters in Danquierinea. It is reported that the rebel commander General Mola has promised to order his troops not to harm the safety of French territory. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>

Currently, the rebel aircraft's bombing target is one of the nearby government army airfields. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Aircraft Supply the Spanish Rebel Army</h3>

<h3>Spanish Territorial Waters - Italy Increases Naval Strength; Another Italian National is Killed; A Serious Protest is Lodged</h3>
<p>(Rome) - A government spokesman announced today that Italy has increased its naval strength in Spanish territorial waters because an Italian national was killed in Spain this week. According to reports, the murdered person's name is Fassarella, a plumber in Barcelona. Official reports have been received here today stating that the only reason for his murder was that religious paintings were found in his home. The Italian consul in Barcelona has been ordered to lodge a serious protest with the Catalan government. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) - According to news from the port of Barcelona, Spain, an Italian national was killed there yesterday. This is the sixth Italian national to have been killed since the outbreak of the civil unrest in Spain. People here were shocked by the news. The deceased national, surnamed Fassarella, worked as a plumber and had seven children. It is said that the reason for his death was that he possessed religious books and images, which angered the left-wing People's Front party members. However, the details of what happened are currently unknown. The Italian consul in the port of Barcelona has lodged a strong protest with the local authorities regarding this matter. An official announcement stated that "Under the current circumstances, such a protest is of no avail." The government has dispatched the 10,000-ton cruiser "Pola" to the port of Barcelona. It should be noted that after the previous case of an Italian national being killed in the area, the Italian light cruiser "Adantoro" has been stationed there and is still docked in the port.

<h3>The United States Decides to Follow the British Example, Retaining 40,000 Tons of Destroyers; Japanese Note Delivered to Washington</h3>
<p>(Washington) - In July, the British government notified both Japan and the United States, stating that the British government had decided to invoke Article 21 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, the "escalator clause," to maintain a total destroyer tonnage of 190,000 tons (the London Treaty originally stipulated 150,000 tons). In other words, it would retain the 40,000 tons of old ships that should have been dismantled this year according to the treaty. US Secretary of State Hull has officially announced that the United States intends to follow the British example and retain 40,000 tons of destroyers that exceed the age limit and should be dismantled according to the London Treaty. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito recently delivered a note to Secretary of State Hull, stating that since the British government has requested to retain 40,000 tons of destroyers that should have been dismantled according to the London Treaty, the Japanese government also requests that 2,059 tons of destroyers and 15,598 tons of submarines that have reached their service age be retained as well. US naval officials have long known that Japan has fewer destroyers that have reached their age limit and that it is insufficient to retain them according to the example. Therefore, they do not find it strange that the country has also requested to retain submarine tonnage to compensate for this. As for the United States, the United States has many destroyers that have reached their age limit, and it is not difficult to retain 40,000 tons according to the example. There are also submarines that have reached their age limit, which can be retained as well. Therefore, the United States does not worry about not being able to cope with Japan's move to increase its naval tonnage. However, the US government has now decided to follow the British example and retain 40,000 tons of destroyers that should be dismantled according to the London Treaty. This point has been confirmed by Secretary of State Hull, but no decision has yet been made on how to handle the submarine tonnage. All naval experts advocate retaining submarines that have reached their age limit at the same time, because the current naval treaties will expire at the end of this year. If the US Congress can approve the new naval treaty signed by the United Kingdom, the United States and France in London this year, then the naval tonnage restrictions will no longer exist from January 1 of next year, and the old submarine tonnage can be fully retained. (According to the new naval treaty signed by the United Kingdom, the United States and France this year, only qualitative restrictions are included.) (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Requests to Retain Submarines - The Opinion of the British Naval Community</h3>
<p>(London) - People in the British naval community are discussing this decision by Japan and have very different opinions. Strictly speaking, the London Naval Treaty only allows Japan to retain warships of the same type as those retained by the United Kingdom. However, the Japanese side argues that its navy has very few destroyers that are too old, which is quite different from the 28,000 tons permitted in the treaty, so submarines are used to make up for the difference. British naval experts all believe that Japan's existing submarines have already reached the maximum tonnage permitted in the treaty. If it wants to retain them now, then its quantity will greatly exceed the limit by the end of this year. It is also heard that the United States is unlikely to object, because Japan's actions do not violate the spirit of the treaty, and it is much more economical to retain old submarines than to build new destroyers, as the treaty will soon expire.

<h3>United States Plans to Strengthen the Merchant Fleet by Adding 350 Ships</h3>
<p>(Washington) - The US Department of Commerce's Shipping Bureau is now preparing to submit a report on the national shipping policy to the newly established Maritime Commission. Officials from the Shipping Bureau vigorously advocated the necessity of strengthening the merchant fleet on the 3rd, saying that most of the US merchant ships are old and do not meet modern requirements. Therefore, it seems that in order to reach the standards of other countries, it is necessary to build 350 new ships. The Maritime Commission will use 500 million US dollars in shipping subsidies this year to start implementing the plan to build new ships, but the cooperation of the private sector is essential to strengthening and expanding the merchant fleet.

<h3>Frequent Border Disputes: Russia Rejects Japanese Protest, Blaming Japan for the Dongning Incident and Demanding a Joint Committee for Resolution</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Yesterday, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union visited Mr. Kazlovsky, the Soviet Russian Minister for the Far East, to protest the so-called violation of the border by Soviet border troops in Dongning, and the illegal firing incident. According to the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, on August 28th, eight bullets from the Soviet territory fell into the "Manchurian" territory in Dongning. On the same day and at the same location, a Soviet machine gun fired upon the Japanese border troops in Shilongtun, resulting in one "Manchurian" injury. On the same day and at the same location, a Soviet aircraft intruded into "Manchurian" territory.</p>
<p>Mr. Kazlovsky has firmly rejected the Japanese protest, stating that he himself protested to the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires on August 27th regarding the incident of Japanese and "Manchurian" soldiers bombarding Soviet border troops watering their horses within Soviet territory, and demanded an immediate thorough investigation and punishment. Mr. Kazlovsky asked the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to note that when the Japanese side raised a counter-protest on August 29th, claiming that the incident occurred in "Manchurian" territory, and that a Soviet border troop's corpse was left within "Manchurian" territory, Mr. Litvinov had firmly rejected the protest, saying it was based on completely false reports, and specifically pointed out the fabrication of abandoning a Red Army soldier's corpse within "Manchurian" territory. At the same time, he reiterated a firm protest against the illegal actions of the Japanese and "Manchurian" sides, which deliberately sought to provoke border conflicts.</p>
<p>Mr. Kazlovsky pointed out that, based on extremely accurate and verified records, he could firmly state that the Japanese report regarding the Soviet border troops' alleged violation of the border near Dongning on August 28th was completely fabricated. Mr. Kazlovsky asked the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to note the recent incident on August 31st of Japanese and "Manchurian" troops bombarding Soviet border troops. Mr. Kazlovsky said, "The constant fabrication of news by the Japanese authorities in Manchuria, and the attempt to shift the responsibility for creating a serious situation onto the Soviet Union, gives the impression that a certain segment of the Japanese military stationed in Manchuria is attempting to pre-emptively conceal their prepared new provocations and make them appear justified. The Soviet government asks the Japanese government to pay special attention to this point and declares that the Japanese side should bear full responsibility."</p>
<p>The Soviet government believes that the continued existence of the current border situation is intolerable and endangers peace. Therefore, it suggests immediately forming a joint Soviet-Japanese-"Manchurian" committee, which the Japanese government formally agreed to on February 14th, but its actual organization has been delayed due to the Japanese side's fault. This committee should be authorized to thoroughly investigate all recent similar incidents. Mr. Kazlovsky finally asked the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to note the recent incidents of Japanese and "Manchurian" troops invading the Soviet border in various places along the Soviet-"Manchurian" border. The Soviet government has instructed its ambassador in Tokyo to lodge a protest. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Prepares for War: Expanding Aviation Education, Requiring an Expenditure of Four Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of the Army, General Terauchi, in view of the fact that all countries in the world are devoting their full efforts to the development of aviation, seeking to strengthen national defense capabilities, especially with the rapid progress of the Soviet Union, keenly felt the necessity for Japan's aviation industry to catch up, thereby solidifying national defense. He decided to start expanding aviation education in the next year's budget, estimated to require an expenditure of approximately four million yuan, which will be added to the next year's new budget, and requested the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The preliminary content is outlined as follows: (1) Increase the budget by 200,000 yuan to expand the Department of Aeronautics in the Faculty of Engineering at Tokyo Imperial University.

<h3>Germany Suggests to Lithuania Concluding a Non-Aggression Pact, Negotiations with Baltic Coastal States Will Also Commence Soon</h3>
<p>Lithuanian capital, it has been learned that the German government recently proposed to Lithuania to conclude a bilateral non-aggression pact, which other countries along the Baltic coast could later sign and join. It is reported that the Lithuanian government is unwilling to accept this constraint alone, so it replied that it would first consult with the Baltic Entente countries (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) for their consent before responding. Regarding this matter, Germany will soon continue discussions with the Baltic coastal states. At this time, the tone of Lithuanian newspapers clearly leans towards Germany (Reuters, Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>Germans Unforgettable: Recovering Old Colonies, Leading Figures of the National Socialist Party Publish Papers Saying There Is Full Legal Basis</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Governor of Bavaria and Chief of the Colonial Policy Office of the National Socialist Party, Chairman of the German Colonial Union, General Epp, recently published an article in the "European Review" magazine on the issue of Germany's demand for colonies. He stated that Germany's demand for the return of colonies is limited to the pre-war colonies deprived by the Treaty of Versailles. The reasons held by General Epp for Germany's demand for colonies are as follows: (1) The territory under German jurisdiction is too narrow to accommodate its population. (2) The existing German territory does not produce various major raw materials. (3) After the colonies were deprived, Germany was relegated to a second-class country. General Epp also said, "The purpose of the German colonial movement is only to abolish the principle that Germany cannot possess colonies and to restore the right of national self-determination in various colonies. It is most unfair not to allow Germany to possess colonies and contradicts the treaty on the Congo signed by the powers in 1885. According to Article 11 of that treaty, the powers solemnly guaranteed that if a war occurred in Europe, it would not involve the colonies. However, it was not Germany that subsequently violated the Congo Treaty, as a British cruiser first opened fire on German East Africa on August 5, 1914, after the outbreak of the Great War. Furthermore, during the Great War, U.S. President Wilson announced fourteen points for peace negotiations, the fifth of which stipulated that the colonial issue should be decided by international arbitration. Later, Article 159 of the Treaty of Versailles regarding German colonies contradicted that fifth point. Moreover, the value of the colonies lost by Germany after the war was not included in Germany's indemnity payments. Therefore, Germany's demand to restore its pre-war colonies has an absolutely sufficient legal basis." (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

Regarding the first point, the production quantity of various military factories should be increased, and workers' strikes should be prevented. Regarding the second point, the number of professional soldiers should be increased from 100,000 to 200,000, and barracks should be added along the border. The extension of the conscription period has not been considered. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Proposals from Colombia and Finland Regarding the Revision of the Covenant</h3>

Since the Queen of Bulgaria is the daughter of King Emmanuel of Italy, and Mussolini is currently consolidating diplomatic fronts in Southern and Eastern Europe, the Bulgarian King's visit here must be related to the overall situation.

<h3>Britain Increases Troops to Palestine, Sussex Autumn Maneuvers Cancelled, British Garrison in Fierce Battle with Arabs</h3>
<p>(London) The large maneuvers of the First Infantry Division in Sussex were canceled yesterday, indicating that the British government will send more troops to Palestine. It is reported that the current British garrison in Palestine consists of about ten battalions. If martial law is implemented, it will not be enough to curb the riots. The Morning Post stated that political circles view the cancellation of the maneuvers as sufficient to indicate that unless the Arabs in Palestine stop the strike and all acts of violence, the British authorities intend to declare martial law. It is now believed that the British authorities have given the Arab Higher Committee sufficient warning and have informed them that the government is prepared to do its utmost to assist in persuading the Arabs. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: Today, the British troops stationed in Palestine engaged in fierce fighting with the Arabs all day in the area of Tulkarm, north of Jerusalem. As a result, three British soldiers were killed and four were wounded. On the Arab side, ten were killed, and the casualties from the air force bombing have not yet been counted. Among the British dead were the pilot, Air Force officer Hunter, and the machine gunner on the plane, who died on the spot when their plane crashed at the foot of a small hill during combat. Among the wounded was the pilot of another plane, who, although wounded in the leg by a bullet, was able to safely land the plane, and an army officer and two soldiers. Today's battle can be described as the most serious since the disturbances in Palestine. The battle began in the morning, when the British Lincoln and Scottish Regiments, in cooperation with the Air Force, encountered a group of over fifty Arabs south of Tulkarm and immediately opened fire. Many of the Arabs fired from the mountainside, but were eventually defeated and retreated to the village of Balai. Later, the Air Force arrived and continued to pursue, and the number of Arab casualties was quite high. However, the Arabs still tried to resist on land, so a British sergeant was killed on the spot, and one officer and two soldiers were wounded. At the same time, it was rumored that the British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Arthur Wauchope, had agreed that if the disturbances ceased, the immigration of Jews would be stopped. This statement has been denied in a letter by the British Colonial Secretary, Mr. Gore. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes County Autonomy Law, Dispute Assessment Committee is Deemed Unnecessary</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 70th meeting on the morning of the 4th, with 56 members including Lin Bin present. Sun Ke presided as chairman, and Liang Hanchao as secretary-general. Matters discussed: (1) The Autonomy Law Committee reported on the revised draft of the County Autonomy Law, and it was resolved to pass the revision. (2) The Legislative Committee reported on the examination of the Organizational Law of the Authority Dispute Assessment Committee, and it was resolved that the committee was not necessary. The main reasons were: A. To maintain the independence and integrity of the Judicial Yuan's judgment and interpretation powers, there is no need to establish the committee. Even if the committee is organized with the existing staff of the Executive and Judicial Yuans, it would be difficult to obtain fair results in assessing disputes between the two Yuans regarding their own powers. B. Since an assessment committee must be established to resolve disputes between the Executive and Judicial Yuans, disputes over authority also occur between the other two of the five Yuans. In the future, there will inevitably be requests to establish similar committees, which will further complicate government agencies. C. Regarding matters that cannot be resolved between the Yuans, Article 17 of the National Government Organization Law already clearly stipulates a method of resolution. Based on the above reasons, the proposal was rejected, and President Sun instructed the Legislative Committee to organize the above reasons in writing for review by the Central Political Council. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Youchang, the convener of the Autonomy Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, reported on the review process of the preliminary report on the revision of the County Autonomy Law at the Yuan meeting on the 4th, stating briefly: After receiving the eight principles of local autonomy laws and regulations issued by the Central Government, a meeting was convened. First, the County Autonomy Law passed by the 86th meeting of the Third Session of this Yuan was submitted for discussion. Based on the central principles and other laws, Articles 2, 3, 43, 44, 53, 59, and 73 of the law were revised, and the original Article 74 was deleted and a new Article 75 was added. In addition, Principle 4 issued by the Central Government states that county governments may, due to geographical, demographic, economic, cultural, and other special circumstances, submit applications to higher-level agencies for approval to establish districts to guide autonomous affairs. There was a general agreement to stipulate this in the Implementing Rules of the County Autonomy Law. As for the autonomous self-defense funds and personnel, they cannot be separated. Based on the results of my inspection of the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan, the Baojia system is incorporated into the autonomous organization, which is already a reality today. However, the organization and implementation of the Baojia system produced by the County Autonomy Law cannot be stipulated in the County Autonomy Law and must be separately stipulated in the Baojia Regulations. Because the Autonomy Law cannot be easily changed, the Baojia Regulations can be changed with the evolution of the autonomous period and the development of civil rights. Therefore, Article 75 has been added. A total of eight articles of the County Autonomy Law amendment have been opened, and the rest have not been modified. The Implementing Rules of the County Autonomy Law, the City Autonomy Law, and its Implementing Rules, and the Baojia Regulations are currently being reviewed in meetings and will be reported to the meeting for further consideration as soon as they are completed. After finishing the speech, Chen Changheng objected to the provision in Article 74 of the amendment, which stipulates that men and women aged 20 or older who reside in this Baojia shall be residents of this Baojia, stating that according to the interpretation of the text of this article, men and women under the age of 20 no longer have resident status, which is unfair in legislation. He advocated deleting the article, which was unanimously passed. The other revised articles were also slightly questioned by the committee members, but all were passed according to the amendment. According to the original County Autonomy Law, which was passed by the 86th meeting of the Third Session of the Yuan on December 21, 1934, there are nine chapters, including Autonomous Regions, County Autonomous Matters, County Citizens, County People's Congress, County Council, County Government, County Finance, Townships and Districts, and Supplementary Provisions, totaling 77 articles, as reported by the Pazhi at the time, but has not been officially promulgated by the National Government. The number of chapters passed by the revised meeting on the 4th remains the same. The articles have been reduced by two compared to the original draft, and a new Article 1 has been added, totaling 76 articles. The main points of the revision are: (1) Incorporate the Baojia system into the autonomous organization. The organization below the county level is one level. The original neighborhoods in the townships are abolished and changed to Baojia. Ten neighborhoods make up a Jia, with a Jia head. Ten Jia make up a Bao, with a Bao head. Ten or more Bao make up a township or district. However, the division and organization of townships and districts may be adjusted according to local natural conditions or customs. The county seat may be divided into several districts, which are at the same level as the townships and districts, and their organization is the same. (2) The County Defense Corps Law is abolished to avoid duplication with the Baojia system. The Baojia Regulations are stipulated separately. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Food Self-Sufficiency Problem in Extraordinary Times (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tong Runzhi, Head of the Agricultural Department of Jiangsu Educational Institute</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Food Self-Sufficiency in Extraordinary Times</p>
<p>Food self-sufficiency is a very important issue in extraordinary times. The reason Germany lost in the European War and the Allied Powers won was primarily due to this point. During this period, the entire nation must pay attention to the issue of food production and food conservation. However, this task is too significant and can only be effective if the government formulates policies to control food production, consumption, and distribution. Moreover, many tasks, such as land distribution, wasteland utilization, food price regulation, and prevention of merchant monopolies, cannot succeed without the government using political power to control them. However, government control policies are difficult to implement smoothly without the support of the people. During the European War, the implementation of food control policies in England, America, Germany, and France was relatively successful, largely because the general public already had training; however, social unrest still occurred. Germany failed because of food shortages, and the United States would have had difficulty winning if it were not blessed with abundant production. As for our Chinese people, who have always lacked education, once war breaks out, various phenomena of disintegration, upheaval, and disorder will inevitably arise. Maintaining law and order has already become a major problem, let alone food control! This requires large-scale and extremely effective public education to guide them on how to work hard to increase production, transport and sell products, and control consumption under government control. If farmers can calmly engage in production and ensure that there are no concerns about food supply, then the war can be won. Therefore, public education is necessary in extraordinary times, and public education must pay attention to this issue of food self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>(2) The Current Status of Food Self-Sufficiency in Our Country and Speculations After the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>Can our country be self-sufficient in food during normal times? The answer to this question must be analyzed based on our country's peacetime food production, consumption, and international trade. Our main food crops are rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains. According to the estimation of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the average annual output of various food crops in the recent three years (1933 to 1935) is approximately 1.8 billion shi, of which 800 million shi are rice and 450 million shi are wheat. In terms of quantity, our country can be considered the world's largest rice and wheat producer. However, although production is high, consumption is also large. Although there are no precise statistics on annual consumption, it can be seen from the annual excess of rice and wheat imports that our rice and wheat production is not yet self-sufficient. Rice has always been insufficient for consumption, and imports of foreign rice have been increasing year by year. In 1912, it was 2.7 million shi; in 1922, it increased to more than 19 million shi; and in 1932, it further increased to 23 million shi, while the annual export volume is very small. Before 1923, wheat was not only self-sufficient but also had an annual surplus for export. However, since 1924, except for a small surplus in 1927, all other years have been years of import surplus. In recent years, the annual import volume has generally been around 20 million shi. Furthermore, according to the latest report from the Customs, the total value of rice imports in 1935 was 93 million yuan, an increase of 42% compared to 1934; the total value of wheat imports was 36 million yuan, an increase of 14% compared to the previous year. The combined total for rice and wheat is 120 million yuan, which shows that domestic rice and wheat production cannot be self-sufficient, and the degree of deficiency is deepening year by year. In addition, miscellaneous grains and miscellaneous grain flour were originally self-sufficient. Before 1932, the export surplus was very large, but most of it was produced in the Northeast and exported from Northeast ports. However, since the September 18th Incident, there have been almost no reports of miscellaneous grain exports in the Customs trade records, indicating that miscellaneous grain self-sufficiency has also become a problem in recent years. In summary, from all perspectives, our country's food supply is insufficient for consumption, and the quantity lacking is increasing year by year.</p>
<p>Although rice and wheat are imported annually, the imported quantity is very low compared to the total consumption. Assuming that the number of rice eaters accounts for half of the country's population and each person's annual consumption is 2 shi, then the total annual consumption is approximately 500 million shi, and the daily consumption is approximately 1.3 million shi. Therefore, the annual import of 20 million shi of foreign rice only supplies the national rice-eating population with food for two weeks, and the quantity lacking cannot be considered large. Japan's annual rice import surplus accounts for 14% of total consumption, which is a much higher degree of rice deficiency than our country. Regarding wheat, although there is an annual import surplus, the imported quantity only accounts for 1% of the total consumption. If there were no wheat and flour imports, the quantity of wheat lacking would only be enough for ten days. Therefore, some people say that although our country's food cannot be completely self-sufficient, it is very close to self-sufficiency. As long as production increases slightly, there will be no concerns about food. However, this statement is correct when viewed from the perspective of normal times. In extraordinary times, the situation is different. Countries that can be self-sufficient in food during normal times often cannot be self-sufficient during wartime. If food cannot be self-sufficient during peacetime, it can still be remedied; however, if food cannot be self-sufficient during wartime, the danger is extremely great. Assuming that we do not pay attention to this food problem now, then once wartime arrives, the following unfortunate phenomena will inevitably occur:</p>
<p>(1) Reduced cultivated land and increased wasteland This is because (1) a portion of young and strong farmers directly or indirectly participate in military work and cannot engage in cultivation; (2) cultivation in or near war zones is inconvenient, or even if planted, it cannot be harvested; (3) farmers fear war and flee, resulting in abandoned fields; (4) farmers with bad habits take the opportunity to abandon their original occupations and engage in improper activities; (5) a portion of cultivated land is occupied by the enemy, and agricultural products are no longer owned by us, as is the case in the four northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>(2) Reduced food supply and increased prices This is because (1) since cultivated land is reduced, production also decreases accordingly; (2) transportation is inconvenient, not only is it difficult to import foreign rice, but even the transportation of domestic rice and wheat is more difficult than in normal times; (3) unscrupulous merchants monopolize the market and hoard food, leading to high prices; (4) the general public competes to purchase food for unexpected needs, and the market supply gradually decreases; (5) people's appetite increases during wartime, making the food supply even more insufficient.</p>
<p>(3) Disrupted social order and greatly affected military affairs This is because (1) food shortages lead to widespread panic; (2) traitors rise up, making it impossible to stabilize the rear, and most people only know how to escape and seek refuge, not how to defend themselves; (3) insufficient rations make it impossible to maintain military discipline; (4) military forces are divided to defend the interior and cannot be concentrated for external defense.</p>
<p>The above three phenomena are all directly or indirectly caused by food shortages. To avoid these phenomena, preparations must be made early. These preparations certainly rely on the government to formulate and implement food control measures, but the efforts and preparations of the people themselves are especially important.</p>
<p>So, how should we, the general public, work hard and assist the government in solving this food self-sufficiency problem? I believe that we must work hard in three areas: first, strive to increase food production to reduce import surplus; second, promote and implement food conservation to reduce consumption; and third, calm the minds of farmers to maintain agricultural labor. If all three of these tasks are effective, then we will not fear food shortages in extraordinary times. Now let me explain them separately.</p>
<p>(3) How to Increase Food Production</p>
<p>There are many ways to increase food production. I will now only present four relatively important ones:</p>
<p>(1) Adopt improved rice and wheat varieties During extraordinary times, our rural compatriots engaged in food production should contact agricultural experiment and educational institutions more often to switch to improved rice and wheat varieties to increase food production. After years of breeding and experimentation, agricultural experiment and educational institutions across the country have cultivated many improved rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grain varieties that can be supplied to farmers in various regions. Approximately fifteen wheat varieties have been successfully improved and promoted, and more than a dozen varieties are being propagated for promotion. Even more varieties are in the experimental stage and have the potential for promotion. The average yield is more than 20% higher than that of local farmers' varieties. More than twenty rice varieties have been successfully improved and promoted, and they can increase the yield by an average of more than 10%. Among the improved miscellaneous grain varieties, there are thirteen millet varieties and eleven sorghum varieties. Others, such as soybeans and corn, are also being bred and have achieved good results. If our rural compatriots can select seeds themselves and maintain close contact with agricultural education or extension agencies in various regions, and adopt improved varieties and cultivation methods, I believe that the nation's food production can increase by 10% in five years.</p>

<h3>After the Guangxi Army Entered Guangdong, Cargo Transport on the Southern Route of Guangdong Province Was Suspended; The Main Forces of the Guangxi Army Were Transferring to the Northeast of Guangxi; The Headquarters of the Guangxi Army Promulgated Wartime Reward and Punishment Regulations</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the Guangxi Army's troops under Weng Zhaoyuan and others entered the southern district of Guangdong Province on the 25th, the Songjiang steamships traveling between Guangzhou and Leizhou have now been suspended. Ships departing from Guangzhou to Shuidong, Meicha, and other places have also been completely suspended. Merchants in the southern route here have stopped handling goods since the 29th. It is reported that Gaolei, Qinlian, and other areas south of Liangyang are now under the control of the Guangxi Army. It is also rumored that three regiments of the Guangxi Provincial Militia were found in Xinyi County, which borders Luoding. Therefore, the Southern District Pacification Office and various agencies in Meicha have mostly relocated. It has been found that the Guangxi Army stationed in the four prefectures of Gaolei, Qinlian, and others are all reorganized from the militia. The regular army of the Guangxi Army has not yet entered Guangdong and is still tightly guarding the Guangxi border. After the Guangxi province expanded its forces, Bai Chongxi and Cai Tingkai were appointed as the commanders-in-chief of the First and Second Route Armies, respectively. Each route army commands three columns. In the First Route Army, Liao Lei commands the First Column, Li Pinxian commands the Second Column, and Xia Wei commands the Third Column. In the Second Route Army, Weng Zhaoyuan commands the First Column, Qu Shounian commands the Second Column, and Shen Guanghan (replaced by Xie Bingxun) commands the Third Column. The two route armies are responsible for operations in Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, and Wuzhou. According to the current situation, the Guangxi Army seems to emphasize the northeast of Guangxi and adopts a defensive posture in the southwest of Guangxi. On the 20th of this month, the 7th Army of Liao Lei's troops moved from Liu to Guixian to reinforce the Yulin-Bobai line. The headquarters of the 7th Army is located in Guiping. The 15th Army of Xia Wei's troops, originally stationed in Guilin, also moved to Longhu Pass, Hexian, and Bapu. Guilin was then defended by the 8th Army of Li Pinxian's troops. Only a small number of troops were left on the Yunnan-Guizhou border to cooperate with the militia in defense. Currently, only the 21st Division of Biao Junchang's troops of the 7th Army is defending the Baise area on the Yunnan border. Only the 26th Division of Mo Shujie's troops of the 8th Army is stationed in Nandan, Hechi, and other places on the Guizhou border. However, the Guangxi Army has adopted a guerrilla strategy in this operation, and each army is not limited to stationed defenses to facilitate flexible deployment. The headquarters of the Guangxi Army has recently promulgated wartime reward and punishment regulations. The original text is as follows: Article 1. These regulations are specially formulated during the time of war to ensure the security of the war zone and to prevent any harm from the enemy, to punish reactionaries, and to reward meritorious people. Article 2. The term "war zone" mentioned in the preceding article shall be temporarily demarcated and announced by order of the General Headquarters of the Army's Headquarters, taking into consideration the circumstances.

Destroying or hindering the army's "clear the fields" strategy. Article 6. Any citizen in the war zone who, in addition to the acts listed in Articles 3 to 5, engages in other significant acts of helping the enemy or harming the army shall be sentenced to imprisonment for one to ten years. Article 7. Any citizen in the war zone who has any of the following meritorious achievements shall be given a bonus ranging from five to one hundred yuan, depending on the circumstances: 1. Seizing enemy firearms, ammunition, or other important military supplies, in addition to being allowed to own them, shall be rewarded according to their nature and quantity; 2.

Other meritorious achievements similar to those listed above shall be rewarded accordingly. Article 8. If the meritorious achievements in the preceding article are particularly outstanding, in addition to being given a bonus, they may also be promoted to officers in the army according to their nature and qualifications. Article 9. Enemy officers and soldiers who can return with weapons or make meritorious contributions will be given a bonus and will still be recruited. Article 10. Ordinary people who have previously defected to the enemy, if they can realize their mistakes and return, will be exempted from punishment. Article 11. Matters not covered in these regulations may be amended by order at any time. Article 12. The area and date of implementation of these regulations will be announced separately by order.</p>
<h3>Losses Suffered by the Japanese in the Invasion of the Four Northeastern Provinces: 140,000 Military and Civilian Casualties; Financial Losses of Several Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: According to a recent statement released by a certain source, since 1931, the number of Japanese people killed and wounded in "Manchukuo" has been no less than 140,000. This loss is still continuing to grow. The Japanese have been constantly talking about the "restoration of Manchurian security," but the Japanese military authorities still insist on greatly increasing the number of troops in Manchuria, claiming that the territory is full of bandits. These two statements are vastly different. If one wants to know the truth, as always, one must seek it in the middle of the two extremes. According to the official figures reported by the Changchun Japanese police, banditry in 1935 was more serious than in 1934. The number of bandit appearances increased compared to before, the total number of bandits far exceeded the previous number, and the losses caused by the bandits greatly increased. No less than 21,000 people were kidnapped by bandits, more than 2,700 were killed, and more than 3,400 were wounded. There were a total of 5,800 arson cases, and the losses caused amounted to several trillion Japanese yen. According to several sources, the north has seen progress this year, but banditry in the east is still rampant. The most serious incident was when 2,000 bandits besieged Fushun, a major town in the northern section of Andong Province. According to official estimates on December 31, 1935, the total number of bandits was 33,605. As in previous years, the highest numbers were in August and September, usually above 65,000. Both of these numbers are significantly lower than those reported in the previous year, but the losses they caused have increased greatly. Now, it is still the season when bandits are most active. Although the monthly reports of each military district have been released, it is not yet possible to determine how the total number of bandits this year has increased or decreased compared to last year. Although there have been no reports of bandit attacks near the main railway lines and large towns, the seriousness of this major problem cannot be ignored. According to the Japanese authorities, the increase in Japanese immigrants can greatly help solve this difficulty. When Japanese people make up one-tenth of Manchuria's population in the future, the banditry problem will naturally be reduced to insignificance. The Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are now both striving to make immigration to Manchuria a national policy of Japan. According to the Japanese military authorities, if northern Manchuria is heavily populated by Japanese, it will be possible to expand transportation, and transportation can be guaranteed during wartime. Several plans have now been proposed, one of which is to move 5 million Japanese to Manchuria in the next 20 years and 500,000 Koreans in the next 10 years. This plan is currently the most favored by the Japanese authorities. To promote Korean immigration to Manchuria, it is now proposed to establish a Korean Colonial Company with a capital of 10 million Japanese yen. Its headquarters will be located in Changchun. There will also be a Korean-Manchurian Colonial Company with a stipulated capital of 20 million Japanese yen. Its headquarters will be located in Seoul and will be established this month. Korean immigrants to Manchuria will strive to be located in the areas bordering Korea and in Jiandao Province. These immigrants are currently planned to be given 50 acres of land per person, with half of it cultivated, 45% used as pasture, and the remaining 5% used for building houses, warehouses, and vegetable gardens. Large-scale reclamation plans in the past have been abandoned because they were not suitable for large-scale immigration and would hire tenant farmers. Since these people have no land, they easily develop class divisions with those who own land. The Manchurian Colonial Company has already acquired 1.7 million acres of land near Jiamusi and is now planning to settle the first batch of immigrants there. This month, according to a statement from the Kwantung Army Headquarters, 500 Japanese soldiers will arrive in Manchuria in April next year to serve as the core of the new colony. The sixth group of immigrants is scheduled to depart at the beginning of this fiscal year, totaling 10,000 households, and will be scattered in the areas of Hulin, Gaoliuzhen (transliteration), and Aihui for reclamation. All three places are adjacent to the Soviet border. In addition, there are four other pieces of land, totaling 5 million acres, all adjacent to the Soviet border, which are planned for livestock farming. Furthermore, miners will also be settled in the Opura (transliteration) area near the Russian border, and 1.25 million acres of land will be demarcated in Jilin Province to settle forest workers. While the Japanese authorities are making every effort to move Japanese people to Manchuria, they are also making every effort to crack down on Chinese coolies entering Manchuria from Shandong Province, saying that their arrival in Manchuria will undermine the living standards of the Japanese. However, despite the crackdown, 10,472 people still landed in Dalian in July of this year, one-fifth of whom were entire families. In the same month, 7,542 people returned to the interior, only one-tenth of whom were entire families. It is estimated that the total number of coolies arriving in Manchuria in July of this year was more than 4,000 less than in the same month last year, and the net number was only 3,000. Compared with the number of people planned to be moved to Manchuria by the Japanese plan, the difference in quantity is incomparable.</p>

<p>The entire trip took 45 hours and 30 minutes; the train traveled extremely smoothly and stopped at all 90 stations along the way; the railway administration's business policy is determined to become commercialized</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Yuehan Railway's first through train departed from Guangzhou South Station at 11:00 p.m. on the 1st, consisting of ten passenger cars, including one second-class car, two third-class cars, two third-class sleeper cars, one open car, one guard car, one dining car, one official car, and one baggage car. Because it was a passenger train, it did not carry cargo. Director Ling Hongxun stayed in Guangdong due to business, so Guangdong Operations Director Luo Nanke, Shaozhou Operations Director Fan Guanglian, Changsha Operations Director Huang Zhaodong, and others traveled north with the train. More than 160 passengers boarded the train in Guangdong. At 7:35 a.m. on the 2nd, the train passed Shaozhou. Because the section of the road from Shaozhou to Chenzhou was newly built, the train traveled slower. At 12:24 a.m., it passed Hengyang. At 7:49 a.m. on the 3rd, it passed Changsha. At 2:58 p.m., it passed Yuezhou. The train stopped briefly at all 90 stations along the way and traveled extremely smoothly. At 8:30 p.m., it arrived at the Xujiapeng Main Station in Wuchang. The entire trip took 45 hours and 30 minutes, only one and a half hours longer than the scheduled 44 hours, and two and a half hours shorter than the test run a few days ago, which took 48 hours. This result is truly gratifying. When the train arrived at Wuchang Station, although there were no grand ceremonies, no fewer than a thousand people gathered to watch, which shows that the public also knows the importance of this route. The train cars had white cloth banners with the words "Yuehan First Through Train." The approximately 300 passengers, upon disembarking, were all elated, because in addition to those who boarded in Guangzhou, no fewer than a hundred people boarded along the way. The first train departing from Xujiapeng, Wuchang, will depart south at 11:00 p.m. on the 4th and is expected to arrive in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 6th. After that, two trains will run in both directions every five days. Daily service will only be possible after the new cars arrive. Fares are particularly low, with first-class tickets costing 36 yuan, second-class tickets costing 24 yuan, and third-class tickets costing 12 yuan. Cargo will be transported under a liability system, and fees will also be low. According to Deputy Director Zhou Zhongqi, the future business policy of this railway will be determined to become commercialized. Every employee must be close to merchants, and the business office will send personnel to various merchant firms and hotels to solicit cargo and provide sales assistance, so that the railway's cargo transportation will become increasingly developed. It is also planned to collect local specialties along the railway line at the end of this year and hold product exhibitions in Guangzhou and Hankou to attract the attention of merchants across the country. According to the railway's secretary, the entire railway was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year and open to traffic on New Year's Day next year. Through accelerated construction, it was able to open to traffic three months ahead of schedule. However, only a portion of the third-class cars ordered in England have arrived. The majority of the remaining cars will arrive by the end of the year. The cars currently in use are mostly borrowed from the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, so service is temporarily scheduled to run two trains in both directions every five days. Daily service can only be changed to daily service when there are sufficient cars. Furthermore, this trip took 45 and a half hours because of delays along the way. In the future, it can be reduced to 36 hours. If it is a special express train, it should be further shortened. To facilitate joint passenger and freight transport, the railway has decided to set up main stations and offices in Xujiapeng, Changsha, and Guangzhou. Whether the main office will be moved to Hengzhou is still undecided, because the center of the Yuehan Railway itself is Hengzhou, but the center of the Yuehan and Pinghan joint transport is Wuchang.

His suicide note involved the case of smuggling private soil in postal packages, and the eleven people involved, including Tong Jiayao, were transferred to the special office for interrogation and detention. Shen Fengzheng, the director of the post office, reported the details of the case to the management bureau and requested instructions on how to handle it. After receiving the report, the bureau believed that the truth of the case should be thoroughly investigated, so it sent Inspector Gu to Wuxi on a secret investigation the day before.

It was decided to go to the county government and the commissioner's office to check the contents of Gu Fuqi's suicide note.

<h3>Liangguang Salt Transport Envoy Tang Haian Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon, Reportedly Summoned by Finance Minister Kong to Discuss Salt Administration, Liangguang Salt Tax Has Increased After Reorganization, Guishi Can Be Resolved Within One or Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Haian, Liangguang Salt Transport Envoy and Senior Advisor to the Finance Department of Guangdong Province, previously served as the Supervisor of the Jianghai Customs. Before the Cantonese Bureau was pacified, he went south on official business and then assumed his current position. He was summoned by Finance Minister Kong and arrived in Shanghai on the Blue Funnel Line's Cling Line (the Hong Kong telegram mistakenly reported as the Baodan Line) at about 12:00 noon yesterday. The ship docked at the company's wharf in Pudong. Mr. Tang changed to a small boat and landed at the New Customs Wharf, then returned to his private residence on Ferguson Road to rest. At 3:30 in the afternoon, Zhu Changnian, the current Supervisor of the Jianghai Customs, paid a visit and had a long conversation. Later, at about 6:00, Mr. Tang went to the Central Bank to meet with Finance Minister Kong for a long talk, discussing everything in detail. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid a special visit to his residence yesterday and was told the following:</p>
<p>Summoned by Kong to Discuss Salt Administration</p>
<p>Mr. Tang first said that he had previously submitted a detailed plan report on the reorganization of the Liangguang salt administration to Minister Kong by airmail. He then received a telegram from Minister Kong, ordering him to come north to discuss it in person, so he rushed to Shanghai. When he would return to the south would depend on when he had met Minister Kong to discuss various matters.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Past Depression of Salt Tax</p>
<p>Chen Jizhou, the Liangguang Salt Transport Envoy, served for eight years. Only in 1932 did the revenue reach 12 million. After that, it was only 9 million per year. The reason for the depression was entirely due to the negligence in suppressing smuggling. Chen reorganized all 25 tax police teams in various places into special service regiments, totaling 3,000 people, and transferred the 12 anti-smuggling fleets to the Provincial Anti-Smuggling Headquarters, entrusting the headquarters to handle salt smuggling on its behalf. For this reason, maritime and land smugglers of illicit salt did whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Revenue Has Increased Greatly Since the Reorganization</p>
<p>The increase in salt tax depends on the strength of our anti-smuggling efforts. After I took office, in view of this, I first restored the tax police and reduced it to 18 teams, about 2,000 people, and assigned them to various places. I also recovered the 12 fleets from the Provincial Anti-Smuggling Headquarters, repaired them, and distributed them to six gates (namely Humen, etc.), and abolished the special tax plus two, special tax plus three, and leaky illegal tax items during Chen's tenure. Although I have been in office for less than a month, in this month, the tax revenue has increased by hundreds of thousands invisibly. If there are no military obstacles in the future, it can increase to 18 million per year.</p>
<p>Future Prospects for Salt Tax</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Guangxi used to buy Cantonese salt. Recently, it has changed to buying Vietnamese salt. If the Guizhou situation is settled, Cantonese salt will be promoted to Guangxi again, and the annual tax revenue will increase by several million more. Also, southern Jiangxi and southern Hunan also used to eat Cantonese salt seven years ago, but later changed to buying Huai salt. In the future, when the whole line of the Yuehan Railway is open to traffic, it will only take one day for Cantonese salt to be transported to Hunan and Jiangxi, which is convenient for transportation and the salt price is relatively low. Once promoted, the annual tax revenue can increase by several million more. It is estimated that the Liangguang salt tax revenue can reach 26 million to 28 million at the highest level each year.</p>
<p>Frugality of Expenses, Prudent Use of People</p>
<p>Regarding expenses, under Chen Weizhou's tenure, the annual cost was 1.8 million. I have been ordered by Minister Kong to make every effort to be frugal. The current budget only requires 180,000 per year, that is, within a month of my arrival, it has been reduced by more than 600,000. In one or two months, it can still be reduced by 100,000 to 200,000. At present, there are more than 1,000 internal and external staff (excluding tax police and fleets). Regarding the use of people, we must be prudent. They must be qualified, have reliable guarantees, and pay more attention to their personality and moral cultivation. We must ensure that tax officials are honest and incorruptible. For example, fleet officers must have nautical knowledge and be well-trained. Everything is based on the central tax police system. In the future, it is best to set up a special school for special training, but this is just a suggestion and must be decided by Minister Kong.</p>
<p>Guangdong Province's Finances Are Gradually on Track</p>
<p>Then the reporter asked about the financial situation of Guangdong Province. Mr. Tang said that the finances of Guangdong Province were chaotic in the past. He had been ordered to travel back and forth many times. Since the government problem was resolved, Director Song (Ziliang) has been working hard to reorganize the finances, abolishing the past deformed tax revenue agencies one by one. The lineup of each agency has been refreshed. Although it has not been long, it has gradually been on track. In the past, the monthly income was 6 million, but now it can reach 8 million. I still remember when Minister Song (Ziwen) was in Guangdong, it reached 14 million. With the efforts of Director Song, it will also reach 14 million in the future. As for the reform of the currency system, Minister Kong previously sent two Vice Ministers Zou (Lin) and Xu (Kan), Director Wu (Qiding), Vice President Chen (Xing), Tang Shoumin, Bei Songsun, and others to the south to hold dozens of meetings. Although various problems cannot be completely resolved overnight, they are generally resolved. After Minister Kong's review, the current price of Guangdong currency and legal currency is set at a ratio of 1.5 yuan to 1 yuan. In the future, miscellaneous currencies will be gradually withdrawn and the legal currency system will be completed. In the past, when Ou Fangpu was the director of the Department of Finance, there was only 100 million taels of silver, but the issuance of banknotes reached 250 million, a huge difference. Now the financial situation is stable, and the people of Guangdong Province are satisfied with the government's facilities.</p>
<p>Resolution of Guizhou Situation Is a Matter of One or Two Weeks</p>
<p>The reporter also asked about the Guizhou situation. Mr. Tang replied that regarding the situation in Guizhou Province, he was not a political person and did not know much. However, according to his observation, the resolution of the Guizhou situation was a matter of one or two weeks, and special peace was still in progress. At the end of the speech, Mr. Tang said that if a person is serious in doing things, he will inevitably be envied. At the beginning of his tenure, he received more than 3,000 letters of introduction from all parties seeking employment. Due to the limited scope of funds, he was unable to extend them all, causing disappointment. He only knew to obey the party and the country, and had no other plans.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Smuggling Suppression Association Telegraphed to Stop Hebei-Chahar New Tax, Trade Union Federation Telegraphed Song Zheyuan to Ask for the Truth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Various Circles Smuggling Suppression Association yesterday telegraphed President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, "President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, since smuggled goods are dumped in various places, the loss of customs duties is not small, and the industrial and commercial enterprises run by Chinese people have suffered a great blow. Fortunately, our authorities have made a wise decision and promulgated the Anti-Smuggling Regulations. Industrial and commercial groups and people who care about the national economy in various places have also risen up to jointly report smuggled goods and support the national economy. The rampant situation has been slightly curbed. Recently, I read in the newspapers that the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee has decided to set up a new inspection office in Tianjin for smuggled goods from September 1, and will levy a new tax, which is about one-eighth of the current customs duty. Goods that have paid this tax are allowed to circulate in Hebei and Chahar. After learning about it, I was shocked. The Hebei-Chahar Political Committee's measures not only violate public opinion and destroy industry and commerce, but also shamelessly pander to foreigners and openly destroy the national regulations. Its drawbacks are that smuggled goods will rely on the one-eighth tax symbol to dump in the Hebei-Chahar market, which will devour the Chinese industries in the two provinces. Moreover, Japanese factories in North China are very developed in manufacturing. Now, with the low-cost raw materials, they can produce goods and dump them in South China. The impact will affect the economy of all provinces, and the collapse is still worrying. At this time, international commercial competition is becoming increasingly acute. All countries are relying on high tariffs to resist. Now, the Hebei-Chahar authorities are degrading tax rates and making a cocoon, which is extremely absurd. It is difficult to remain silent about the rise and fall of industry and commerce and the safety of the national economy. I respectfully request the Executive Yuan to strictly stop it, so as to maintain the national regulations and the people's livelihood. The Shanghai Various Circles Smuggling Suppression Association respectfully kowtows."</p>
<p>The Trade Union Federation yesterday telegraphed Chairman Song of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee in Peiping, "Recently, there have been rumors that your association has decided to levy a new tax on goods transported into Tianjin from September 1, and will levy one-eighth of the current customs duty, that is, it will be allowed to circulate within the territory and will be protected by the authorities. This unfounded statement can be dismissed as nonsense, but since the smuggling problem in North China occurred, the national finances and the national industry and commerce have been affected. Fortunately, the central government has strictly stopped it, and it has only slightly reversed the decline. You are sitting in the north, and you must also be worried about this situation, planning the overall situation, seeking a whole solution, and fulfilling the expectations of the people. You know that what is said on the way is exaggerated, but for the sake of stabilizing all industries, I have to telegraph your association to indicate the truth in order to dispel doubts. Furthermore, if the previous news is true, a large number of smuggled goods will be imported from North China again, gradually advancing south and spreading to various places. Not only will our country's tariff barriers be completely destroyed, but also the industrial and commercial industries will inevitably collapse, and the impact on the people's livelihood will be even greater than before. What I think is dangerous, I cannot remain silent, so I dare to attach it. I hope you will consider it carefully. The Chinese Industrial General Federation respectfully kowtows."</p>
<h3>All Students Must Use X-ray Examination, Municipal Education Bureau Notifies All Schools to Comply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday instructed all schools in the city, "According to the report of Gu Yuqi, the president of the private Tongde Medical College, the rise and fall of a country depends on the strength of the nation, and the strength of the nation must depend on the health of the people's physical fitness. Therefore, health is an important plan for the revival of the nation today, and an urgent task that cannot be delayed for saving the country and survival. Today's students are at the time of youth growth, and they are also the key to the strength of our future nation. Those who are teachers and guardians should cherish and protect them, so that they have a healthy physique and become useful talents for the country and the nation. It is necessary to prepare for the future and catch up in a hurry. The harvest of the mulberry tree is still not too late. The college previously received an order from the ministry that all new students at the time of enrollment, and old students at the beginning of each academic year, must conduct a detailed physical examination once, which shows that the central authorities have also paid attention to it. Its importance does not need to be stated again. However, with ordinary physical examinations, it is difficult to accurately diagnose whether students' physical fitness is truly healthy and whether diseases are hidden internally. In a school with a large number of students, living together all day long, the spread of diseases is always worrying. The college has seen this, and has decided to add X-ray examinations to the new and old students from this semester, in addition to physical examinations, in order to see the key to the problem and show caution. However, this examination is related to the health of school groups, and is not limited to one school. It is requested that the bureau appreciate the importance of this prevention work, and allow all new and old students of the schools in the city to undergo this X-ray examination at the time of enrollment. In order to achieve popularization, the college will only charge a handling fee of one yuan per person for professors and new and old students from all schools to come to the Tongde Hospital affiliated to the college (address: No. 1, Lane 67, Tongfu Road, New Quanpu Road), and elementary school students can also be reduced appropriately, or it can be approved and complied with by the bureau. As for the time, it is scheduled from 10:00 to 12:00 every morning. If there are too many people, you can negotiate in advance and agree on a time to prepare. Is it appropriate? I respectfully ask for verification and immediate implementation, so as to emphasize public health and benefit the prevention of tuberculosis. According to this, the prevention of tuberculosis is indeed important. Now the preferential treatment measures have been discussed and decided. A handling fee of one yuan will be charged for X-ray examination of the lungs for students of specialized subjects and above, eight corners for middle school students, and six corners for elementary school students. All should be examined from September 1 to the end of October this year. The order is hereby issued for all schools to comply with."</p>
<h3>The Municipal National Election Promotion Association Yesterday Issued an Announcement to All Citizens, Registration Without Oath Has No Civil Rights, I Hope All Citizens of the City Will Enthusiastically Participate in the Oath</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal National Election Promotion Association, all parties have paid a lot of attention to it. The association yesterday issued an announcement to the public, the original text is recorded as follows, "Dear citizens of the city, the National Assembly will be opened in Nanjing on November 12 this year. All people of the Republic of China who are 20 years old, regardless of gender, rich or poor, or whether they have been educated, as long as they have not committed a crime, as long as they do not have mental illness, have gone through civil registration and civil oath, and have obtained civil rights, can have the right to elect National Assembly representatives or be elected as National Assembly representatives. Everyone knows that the National Assembly is an important hub for our country to transition from the period of political tutelage to the period of constitutional government. The success or failure of the National Assembly can determine the future of our country. Therefore, all of us who are loyal to the Republic of China, for the sake of the future of the country, must not only not give up the right to elect representatives to the assembly, but also properly use this right to elect appropriate representatives to the assembly according to ideal standards. If the members of the assembly are good, the results of the assembly will naturally be good. Therefore, we must not relax our efforts to obtain civil rights and the right to vote. We must go through civil registration, and we must hold civil oaths. Otherwise, all the rights that citizens should enjoy cannot be fully enjoyed and exercised. Needless to say, he has no part in the election or election of National Assembly representatives. Now, civil registration in our Shanghai has been completed, and civil oaths will soon be held in various districts. The association hereby hopes that all citizens of Shanghai, if they have already gone through civil registration, must go to take the civil oath on time after the date of the oath is announced. This is our right and our obligation. Whoever gives up civil registration and civil oath gives up civil qualification, and is outside the Republic of China. It should also be noted that the first necessary condition for obtaining civil rights is to go through registration, and the second necessary condition after registration is to take the oath. If you only register but do not participate in the oath ceremony, then the citizen's certificate cannot be obtained, and civil rights cannot be exercised. Therefore, registration alone is not enough. It is necessary to participate in the oath to be considered to have met the statutory procedures and to have obtained the statutory qualifications. Now the oath will be held soon, please pay attention to the date."</p>

<p>Members of the eleven district education associations affiliated with the Municipal Education Association, as well as faculty and staff from public and private universities and independent colleges, who had not taken the oath previously, took the oath in nine locations including the Municipal Education Association yesterday. From morning till night, participation was extremely high. The National Election Office dispatched Lin Meiyan and Huang Tiren to oversee the oaths. At the Shanghai Cement Company, Beipiao Wharf, Wing On Textile Factory, Jiangnan Shipyard, and the two railway bureau administrations, employee oaths were held separately yesterday morning. The office dispatched Ding Shoutang, Shi Renzheng, Wang Chenge, Yang Dean, and Tan Peiyan to oversee the oaths. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters also held citizen registration oaths for officers at the headquarters yesterday morning, presided over by Commander Yang, with Jiang Huaisu overseeing. In total, approximately 20,000 people took the oath in various locations yesterday.</p>
<p>Three Groups to Elect Tomorrow</p>
<p>The office has already notified and instructed the executive personnel of the Chambers of Commerce, Journalists Association, and Education Association to hold separate elections for candidates representing their respective units tomorrow at three locations: the Municipal Chambers of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge, the Journalists Association at the Dalu Commercial Building, and the Municipal Education Association at Daji Road. The times are as follows: Chambers of Commerce from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, Journalists Association from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, and Education Association from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Method for Electing Representatives</p>
<p>According to the election law, the election of representatives from professional groups or freelance professional groups, if the group has multiple levels, should be conducted by the executive organs and staff of its lowest-level group. Therefore, tomorrow for the three groups, except for the Journalists Association, which has no lower-level organization and should have all its executive committee members present to elect, the Chambers of Commerce should have the executive committee members of each trade association established before the promulgation of the election law and already affiliated with the Municipal Chambers of Commerce present to elect. The education groups should have the directors of each district education association and the presidents, deans, and secretaries-general of national or registered private universities and independent colleges present to elect. All personnel with the right to elect must have already registered as citizens. Therefore, they must bring their own group or school certificate and citizen certificate when attending to receive election ballots and have the right to elect. Furthermore, the qualifications of candidates are as follows according to law: (1) Have the qualifications of an elector, (2) be at least 25 years old, (3) have been engaged in the profession for more than three years (intermittent periods can be combined), (4) currently be a member of the group. Electors should pay attention to these points. As for the number of candidates to be elected, it should be the same as the number of representatives that each group should send (i.e., four for the Chambers of Commerce, eleven for the Journalists Association, and eighteen for Education). After the ballots are counted, three times the number of representatives will be selected and submitted to the National Government for designation.</p>

He returned to Shanghai by plane the day before yesterday afternoon. That night, he met with Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe to report on the investigation of the Chengdu case.

<h3>Inspection of Artificial Silk Fabrics Transport and Sales, Temporary Approval of Association Certification, Exchange Licenses with Certificates, Effective Today</h3>
<p>In order to prevent smuggling, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Inspection and Clearance Methods for Artificial Silk Woven Native Goods Pitoo," stipulating that a "License for Transporting and Selling Artificial Silk" must be presented to exchange for a "License for Transporting and Selling Pitoo." Because very few silk factories in China directly import materials and produce and sell their own products, most silk factories are transferred by silk shops to Shanghai and distributed to various locations. If the previous regulations are followed, it will be impossible to transport and sell. Therefore, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance and other agencies to change the regulations. Yesterday, Wu Xingcha and Lou Fengshao again petitioned the Jianghai Customs and the General Tax Office. They reached an agreement after discussion. Before the Ministry of Finance's relief measures are announced, the industry association will temporarily be allowed to issue certificates to exchange for transport and sales licenses to facilitate transportation. This measure will be implemented starting today.</p>
<h3>National Inspection Association Sends Letter to Wuhu Customs, Requesting Extension of Registration Period</h3>
<p>The National Inspection Association received a telegram from the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting that the letter be forwarded to the Wuhu Customs to allow merchants who have not registered to complete registration with certification from the Chamber of Commerce. The association has already forwarded the letter to the Wuhu Customs Commissioner for handling. The telegram is as follows: "To the National Inspection Association of Chambers of Commerce in various places of the Republic of China: It has been found that according to the regulations for registration of factories, shops, and transportation companies with customs, the deadline is twenty days from the date of local announcement. Wuhu has long been operating, but because of the spring famine, operations were suspended. There are also many factories, shops, and transportation companies that have resumed business or newly opened after autumn that have not registered. If registration is not supplemented to facilitate transportation and sales, or even if their operations are temporarily suspended, commerce and the people's livelihood will be affected. In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration requesting relief, we also request your association to appeal on our behalf to allow the Wuhu Customs to supplement registration for all factories, shops, and transportation companies certified by our association in order to provide relief and benefit commerce. We would be very grateful and look forward to your reply. Tao Yutang, Chairman of the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, respectfully sends his greetings."</p>
<h3>Special Transportation Prices for Cotton Yarn, Approved by Ministry for One-Year Extension</h3>
<p>Special prices for cotton yarn and cotton woven goods transported between Beijing and Shanghai were established last year, namely, full carloads are not reduced from the original grade.

The bureau submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways, which approved it on September 1. The extension will continue for one year from September 1.</p>
<h3>Opium Addicts in This City Actively Register, More Than 200 Go to the Bureau to Register Daily, Opium Addiction Hospitals Are Overcrowded</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to handle opium prohibition matters, it has been actively progressing with considerable results. The reporting and registration of opium addicts has reached more than 50,000. The original deadline for registration was the end of last month. However, in order to give opium addicts a final opportunity to reform, a special request was made to the opium prohibition supervisor to extend the deadline by ten days, deciding that it would end on the 10th of this month. There are still five days left. Yesterday, a reporter from the National News Agency went to the Public Security Bureau to interview Section Chief Dai of the Opium Addict Registration Section in order to understand the latest situation of opium prohibition. According to the interview, the section is responsible for handling opium prohibition matters in the city. Recently, during the extension period, opium addicts have realized that it is wrong to delay and evade registration. More than 200 people a day have voluntarily gone to the bureau to register and confess. Approximately 20 to 30 people a day have voluntarily requested to be sent to a hospital to quit opium. As a result, the Municipal Shanghai North and Shanghai South Opium Addiction Hospitals, the Opium Addiction Prison, and the Longhua Detoxification Center are filled with opium addicts. There are no vacant beds. Those currently requesting to quit opium must register in advance and wait their turn to enter the hospital. This shows the enthusiasm of opium addicts to confess. However, the section still sends staff out every day to supervise the various branches and teams to diligently investigate in order to achieve the goal of registering all opium addicts in the city and prohibiting them step by step. If opium addicts fail to report before the deadline, they will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for severe punishment according to law, with no leniency.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Sericulture Committee Discusses Purchasing Autumn Cocoons</h3>

Please do not make a mistake."</p>
<h3>Four Overseas Chinese from France Returned to the Country and Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, Chinese workers who went to France had participated in the European War and lived there for 20 years. Recently, due to unemployment, they were on the verge of destitution. Fortunately, a Chinese shipping company purchased a merchant ship from France (named Haiwen), which came to Shanghai from France. The Chinese workers were able to get assistance from the Chinese Consul in France and搭乘 (hitch a ride) on the ship. After arriving in Penang, they transferred to another ship to return to the country and arrived in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Four Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau received the news and sent a special commissioner to take care of them. They were temporarily placed in客棧 (hostels) and will be sent back to their hometowns.

(3) Zhang Yulong, 35 years old, from Anhui, lived in France for 19 years, working as a worker. Zhou Linian, 30 years old, from Sichuan, lived in France for 20 years, working as a machine worker.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Russia</p>
<p>There were actually only 18 overseas Chinese from Russia who arrived in Shanghai on the Russian ship Northern (the report of 400 was a mistake. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau feared misunderstandings and requested clarification). Of the 16 who have already registered, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau has requested the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send them away. There are still two people staying at the Tongfa Hostel on Yong'an Street in the French Concession (these two have not registered, and their names are unknown). The names and origins of the 16 registered overseas Chinese from Russia are as follows: Ding Zifeng, Yu Wenhua, Xu Facai, Zhang Guifen, You Yunting, Yang Binghe, Yang Zhaogu, Jiao Jijun, Wang Baojin, Song Peiqi, Sun Zhendong, Li Yang (with one child), and Li Shunde, all from Shandong; Ma Deshan from Hebei, and Chen Yaoling from Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>Central Civil Training Department Explains Organization of Private Associations</h3>
<p>According to Dagong news agency, the Central Public Training Department issued an order yesterday to the party departments of various provinces and cities to explain the handling of existing private associations. The original order stated, "The Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee submitted a report stating that the District Executive Committee of Yunhe County reported that there were private association organizations among the people in the county. The number of people ranges from three to dozens, with a long history. They also bought租石 (rent stones) and held a聚餐 (feast) once a year. The purpose is聚餐 (feasting), or studying literature, or connecting feelings, or worshiping a certain god. Therefore, the names are a certain association, a certain club. It is necessary to investigate and register this type of organization. However, since there are non-religious cultural charity groups, what procedures should be used to register has not been clearly stipulated. The facts are listed in detail and a request for explanation is made as follows: (1) This type of association organization belongs to文人 (literati) and worships Zhu Wengong and Wenchang Dijun. It belongs to the general public, then it is called the Bai Xiang Hui (Worship Incense Association) and still worships gods, such as the Land Association and the Lady Association. The purpose is pure and there is no illegal action. It should fulfill the registration. How should it be registered? Please explain this. (2) Associations that have not been registered by party and government agencies are not legal organizations. What method should be used to suppress or force the registration of the above associations? Please explain this. (3) The annual consumption of the association is quite large. Can we persuade them to organize rural cooperative societies with the money that should be consumed, or use political power to correct the association's property and allocate production facts? Please indicate this. Regarding the above three points, we hereby submit a document requesting your association to explain and follow it. It is convenient for the party and so on. Based on this, the various situations mentioned are not unique to that county. The headquarters has not been able to decide how to deal with it. In addition to replying, we hereby submit a document requesting your review and explanation. Regarding the three points for which an explanation is requested, the headquarters has replied as follows: (1) Associations that have the nature of academic research or improving customs should be listed as cultural groups. Associations with public welfare nature should be listed as public welfare groups. Associations that belong to the above two types should guide the community to apply for filing according to law. (2) In addition to promoting superstition and harming social安宁 (peace and tranquility), the guidance of existing civil associations should be notified to government agencies at any time to suppress them. The method of persuasion should be used. (3) Associations that belong to the category of economic mutual assistance may, depending on the nature, guide them to establish various cooperative societies in a persuasive manner. In addition to replying by letter, please check and forward it to be observed and handled carefully."</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at Five Silk Weaving Factories in West Shanghai, Mediation Successful at Three Factories, Two Factories Resume Strike, Officials Schedule Mediation on the 7th</h3>
<p>The workers at the five silk weaving factories in the West Shanghai area, including Baohua, Yucun, Yiyou, Tiancheng, and Yongfeng, went on strike to demand increased wages. After party and government agencies sent personnel to persuade them to resume work first, the Social Affairs Bureau specially convened both labor and management the day before yesterday to mediate according to law. The two parties agreed and signed a settlement record for the Yiyou, Tiancheng, and Yongfeng factories. However, the mediation at the Baohua and Yucun factories failed. Starting yesterday, the workers at these two factories went on strike again. It has now been scheduled for the 7th to mediate again. The settlement methods for the Yiyou and other three factories are recorded as follows: (1) Yiyou, the wages for plain satin are uniformly calculated at four and three-tenths cents per meter. The artificial silk crepe is uniformly increased by 8 percent from the original wage. The wages for the preparation department are uniformly increased by 5 percent. (2) Tiancheng, the wages for four-inch single crepe in the weaving department are increased by five cents from the original. The wages for the preparation department are uniformly increased by 5 percent. (3) Yongfeng, plain satin is increased by five cents per foot from the original wage.

<h3>Sugar Industry Pays Attention to Smuggled Sugar</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the North-South Goods Demolition and Exchange Industry Association reporting that a large amount of smuggled Japanese sugar was found in the city and sold to sugar industry members and businesses. After forwarding the letter to the sugar industry to pay attention, the Sugar Industry Association replied that the association had previously had people who purchased confiscated smuggled sugar from Tianjin Customs and transported it to Shanghai. Because the price of sugar in Shanghai was weak, it was heard that they were trying to sell it. The sugar shot by the letter may be this shipment. The association is confident that it is strict in preventing private holdings, and the members all know the importance of the matter. It will not be accepted without obtaining legal procedures, and it will break the private defense line. Before receiving the letter, in addition to paying close attention, it is a special reply, and I hope it will be referred to, and it is very grateful.</p>
<h3>Nagasaki Maru Collided with Mingsheng Ship in the Huangpu River Yesterday, Gonghe Ship Collided as Well</h3>
<p>The Mingsheng, a steamer of Ewo Yanghsing Company, was on a regular voyage to the South Seas. It had sailed from Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Swatow to Shanghai this time. It entered the port at 12:20 PM yesterday and was about to sail to Shun Tai Wharf for berthing. Before arriving at the wharf, it stopped and turned around. It was docking when the Nagasaki Maru of Japan Mail Steamship Co. also entered the port. The Nagasaki Maru was about to reach the Hongkou River surface. At that time, the Mingsheng had turned around and was berthing. The Nagasaki Maru was also sailing to that area and was preparing to turn around and prepare to berth at Huishan Wharf. However, it was high tide and the water was very rough. The Nagasaki Maru was trying to turn its body, and its bow slammed into the</p>
<p>Mingsheng Ship</p>
<p>Because the Mingsheng had stopped to berth, it was inevitable. With a bang, the bow of the Mingsheng was hit by the Nagasaki Maru. Because the force was too great, the body of the Mingsheng was pushed back after being hit. The Gonghe, an Ewo Yangtze River ship, which was berthed behind the Mingsheng, was also hit by the stern of the Mingsheng, which hit the bow of the Gonghe. The Gonghe also shook. As a result, the Mingsheng</p>
<p>Bow and Stern Were Damaged</p>
<p>Because the stern rudder blade happened to hit the bow of the Gonghe, it was badly damaged, and the bow was severely injured by the Nagasaki Maru. The Nagasaki Maru and the Gonghe received very little damage. After the accident, both parties sent personnel to survey the damage. At the same time, they reported to the company and the Customs Port Authority for inspection. The Mingsheng could only quickly unload passengers and cargo from the ship to the wharf. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Qingdao today to transport goods. Because the ship was damaged and could not sail without repairs, it was decided yesterday afternoon to temporarily cancel the voyage to Qingdao and prepare to enter the factory for major repairs.</p>
<h3>New Suspects Apprehended in Japanese Sailor Case: Closed-Door Trial, Details Unknown, Detention Extended for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>The case of the murdered Japanese sailor, Hideo Nakayama, has been under investigation due to the complexity of evidence and the time required for the investigation. Recently, the Public Concession Police apprehended two more suspects: Zhu Guisheng from Yangzhou and Jin Daoquan from Jiangbei. They are suspected of involvement in the Nakayama case and the murder of Japanese man Kanzo Kayao. Both men were handed over to the First Special District Court for detention, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The police have also discovered that Zhang Yuhua (also known as Zhang Shimin, also known as Zhang Wei, 36 years old) from Baoying, who was arrested by inland authorities for the assassination attempt on President Wang Jingwei, is significantly related to both the Nakayama and Kayao cases. A request has been made to the Jiangsu High Court to transfer him. The request was approved, and he has been transferred from the capital to Shanghai and detained at the Songhu Garrison Command. He was brought back to the police station by Western Detective Krote the day before yesterday. Because Zhang was ill, he was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. Simultaneously, Chen Siming (32 years old) from Yangzhou, who is believed to be involved in both cases, was also apprehended. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Chen and Zhang to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu, based on Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requested detention for further investigation. Due to the seriousness of the case, he also requested a closed-door trial, which was approved by Judge Zhong Qing. Therefore, the details of the trial are unknown. The judge then immediately announced the approval of detention and adjourned the hearing for further review. The number of Chinese arrested in connection with the Nakayama case has reached seven: Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, Zhou Sherong, Zhu Guisheng, Jin Daoquan, Chen Siming, and Zhang Yuhua.</p>

<h3>Grand Opening of the China National Products Company: Chen Yumei Surrounded by Crowds</h3>
<p>The China National Products Company on Nanjing Road and Shilu intersection held its opening ceremony yesterday at 10:00 AM. Famous movie star Ms. Chen Yumei cut the ribbon.

<h3>Development Plan for Ziti Town in Western Shanghai: Welcoming Investment to Revitalize Industry</h3>
<p>Ziti Town (i.e., Zhuzhai) is located at the border of this city and Jiading and Qingpu counties, less than twenty li from this city. In the past, traffic was blocked, forming a closed-off situation. Since the autumn of the year before last, thanks to donations from local gentry such as Hou Shuda, the Puzhanzhai Road was built and connected to Caoyadu and other roads in western Shanghai, greatly improving traffic. Recently, Hou Shuda, Huang Chengbo, Zhu Jingyu, Zhu Qin Yuan, and others have proposed dredging the Panlong River to connect it with the Suzhou Creek (Wusong River). If the dredging is successful, ships of several hundred tons can pass through without obstacles. From then on, water and land transportation will be convenient, and the area will become an important town in western Shanghai. If businesses from all sectors come to build factories and farms to revitalize industry, they are sure to reap substantial profits. The price of land in the town is low (less than 500 yuan per mu). Those interested in investing can contact the four gentlemen: Hou, Huang, Zhu, and Zhu.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Issues Pedicab Owner Certificates from September 15th to November 14th</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities issued Order No. 3538 to the pedicab associations in the Special District and the North and South City Pedicab Associations yesterday, stating: "It has been investigated that this bureau previously received petitions from various licensed pedicab owners requesting permission to donate licenses themselves for their own pedicabs. This bureau has drafted measures for issuing owner certificates to licensed pedicab owners. The certificates are exclusively for proving ownership of the pedicabs, and licenses can be obtained and donated based on the certificates thereafter. The same measures apply to licensed pedicabs operating in western Shanghai, but the words 'Temporary Certificate' will be added to distinguish them. The above measures have been approved by the Municipal Government for implementation and must be completed within two months. Therefore, in addition to separate instructions, notifications, and orders, this order is issued to the associations to inform all car merchants to go to the General Affairs Office of this bureau before September 30th, fill out the application form according to the regulations, and apply for the issuance of the licensed pedicab owner certificates.

At the same time, the bureau also notified all car owners in the city to go to the office to receive the certificates at the designated time.</p>
<h3>Allegations of Preferential Purchases of Foreign Electrical Appliances Denied by Auditing Department, etc.: Reply to National Goods Federation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Promotion Federation received a letter from the Electrical Appliance Industry Association stating, "According to rumors from colleagues in the capital, the Auditing Department has designated a certain brand of foreign light bulbs, and the Railway Police Headquarters has designated a certain brand of foreign electric fans. Please send separate letters to the above two agencies to inquire about the truth." After the federation sent separate letters, it recently received replies from the Auditing Department and the Railway Police Headquarters stating that the light bulbs and electric fans they used were domestic Huade brand light bulbs and Huasheng brand electric fans. The allegations of designating the purchase of foreign electrical appliances are not true. The original letters stated: (1) Auditing Department's reply: "In reply to your letter, advocating national goods is the patriotic duty of our people. Your understanding of the greater good is admirable. The electrical appliances purchased for the construction of the new building by this department are indeed domestic Huade brand products, according to the contracting company. This department has not designated the use of foreign goods. The rumors are false and unfounded. We hereby reply to your inquiry. To the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Federation." (2) Railway Police Headquarters' reply: "In reply to your letter, we received your letter stating that according to rumors from colleagues in the capital, the Railway Police Headquarters has designated the use of a certain brand of foreign electric fans. Please inform us of the actual situation to dispel doubts. The electric fans and ceiling fans purchased by this bureau this year are produced by the domestic Huasheng Company. Ordinary purchases are also prioritized for domestic goods to promote them. The allegation of designating a certain brand of foreign electric fans is not true and is likely a misunderstanding. We hereby reply to your inquiry and hope you will check and correct the record. To the Shanghai National Goods Promotion Federation."</p>

<h3>Fellow Villagers from Zhongshan County Discuss Repatriating Ancestral Remains for Burial</h3>
<p>Zhongshan County is the hometown of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. It is estimated that no fewer than 40,000 to 50,000 villagers from Zhongshan are engaged in business or serving in Shanghai. Among them are leaders and talents in the political and business circles, such as Wu Tiecheng, Yu Hongjun, Chen Bingqian, Cai Zengji, Guo Shun, Zheng Bozhao, Wang Yunwu, and Yang Meinan, all well-known figures in society. Recently, due to the low-lying and damp terrain of the GuangZhao Old Cemetery in Chedaijiao and its proximity to the Suzhou River, which has been plagued by floods in recent years, the remains of deceased villagers from Zhongshan buried there have not been properly settled. A movement has been launched to collectively relocate the remains of deceased villagers to Xinzhuang for burial to comfort the wandering souls and properly honor the ancestors. A general meeting of the initiators will be held at 2:00 PM on the 6th of this month at the Yueqiao Commercial Federation on Bazhi Road to discuss everything and jointly plan the undertaking. Zhongshan County has always been known as a model county, and it is certain that it will fully demonstrate its spirit of unity in carrying out this public welfare undertaking that concerns the county. It is reported that the current committee members preparing for the meeting are Chen Bingqian, Li Yunshan, Shen Linsheng, Li Huasheng, Gao Jieyuan, Yang Fengyao, Li Fengzhang, Chen Shounan, Yang Huiji, Zheng Xiufen, Wei Zhiting, Zhong Zhinan, Zheng Yaotang, and others.</p>
<h3>Liu Kuai Determined to Rectify Detective Corps: All Old Malpractices to Be Eradicated; Raise Treatment to Encourage Honesty</h3>
<p>Cai Jingjun, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, believes that the Detective Corps has long been plagued by deep-rooted malpractices and urgently needs rectification. Furthermore, due to the rampant bandits in recent months, attention should be paid to local security. He has specially appointed Liu Kuai to take over as Captain of the Detective Corps, responsible for rectification and reform. After Liu took office the day before yesterday, he gathered all the chief and deputy team leaders at the headquarters yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to address them. He stated that the general public has always viewed the Detective Corps as a lower-level organization. Moreover, due to the misconduct of unscrupulous members of the corps, they have not respected themselves and have acted recklessly, leading to criticism from the entire society. This time, he is determined to serve the entire society at the cost of sacrifice. He will uphold the director's intentions to rectify the corps, and all rewards, punishments, promotions, and demotions will be impartial. He will prioritize quality over quantity as the standard for rectification. He will also request to increase the treatment of the corps to ensure that everyone has a stable life and that their salaries are sufficient to encourage honesty. All other existing malpractices will be completely eradicated. He will be responsible for solving past cases within the shortest possible time so that all undesirable elements disturbing the local area will not dare to hide in Shanghai. If this is done, the status of colleagues will be invisibly elevated and trusted by the people of the whole society.</p>

<h3>Abolishing Extra Tips: Hotel Workers' Union Pours Out Its Views; Stipulate Wage Amounts with Reference to Hangzhou and Nanjing Examples; Eliminate the Evil Habit of Hotels Collecting Security Deposits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel Industry Workers' Union, for the New Life Movement Promotion Association, improves bad habits and abolishes extra tips. The union has been collecting opinions from members across the city for days and submitted them to the Shanghai New Life Cadre Association. The original text is as follows: "Submitted to plead for sympathy for the hardships of workers, determine salaries, protect security deposits, split tips, to implement the New Life Movement, thoroughly eradicate bad habits, cultivate good habits, and maintain the new movement. This union received a notice from your association to attend the New Life Discussion Meeting. At the first meeting, we read the New Life General Association's principles and implementation methods for abolishing extra tips. We understand that the implementation of the New Life Movement is something that the public should sincerely follow. The government and civil servants should also supervise its practice. Therefore, the abolition of extra tips is undoubtedly necessary. This union, in view of the fact that the abolition of this extra tip relates to the survival of all members of the union, specially convened a meeting of members on August 1 to discuss it. We resolved and reported the methods to your association, and submitted them to the meeting for discussion on file. After three meetings, we passed the draft implementation methods and requested the cadre association to pass and implement them. This union has to state the actual situation. We sincerely request your association to consider the suffering of workers so that workers under heavy restrictions of bad habits can be free from unreasonable restraint. The original intention of the New Life Movement to improve bad habits can also be implemented. Shanghai is the hub of national industry and commerce, a place of international attention. In recent years, the market has been depressed, factories have closed, and stores have closed. The decline of industry and commerce is indeed a fact. However, although the employees of various industries have also suffered considerable losses from the suspension or bankruptcy of their businesses, the impact on waiters is particularly great and profound when hotels go bankrupt or suspend operations. Bankruptcies have been seen and heard from time to time in recent years, but new hotels continue to open, an abnormal situation caused by using waiters' security deposits as capital. There is no guarantee in advance. Once a hotel suspends operations, it is not easy to return the security deposit. Most waiters are poor people from bankrupt rural areas seeking a living in the city. Eighty or ninety percent of the money for this security deposit comes from high-interest loans. Once the security deposit cannot be returned, they lack the funds to sue and lack the preparation to wait for a long time to earn a living. The various hardships are not known to outsiders. Moreover, waiters work long and hard hours, and their food and treatment are meager and harsh. They do not receive any salary, and they do not share in the tips. If they do not collect extra tips to make a living, how can the waiter's family survive? Therefore, this evil habit of collecting extra tips is actually cultivated by the greed of employers, not the waiter's original intention. In the process of national revival and the implementation of the New Life Movement, this unreasonable bad habit should be abolished to show determination. However, how to consider the lives of waiters after the abolition should also be decided first to facilitate implementation. Also, the huge security deposits collected by employers without any guarantee, which are used to supplement the employer's capital, is also one of the bad habits. It seems appropriate to plan for a safe way to ensure that social life and social order are both adjusted. After consideration by this union, we propose that your association refer to the examples of Nanjing and Hangzhou and separately stipulate the minimum and maximum wage amounts that waiters in large and small hotels should receive, the date and frequency of daily payment, and the method of splitting tips, and issue orders for uniform implementation throughout the city to alleviate the lives of waiters after the prohibition of extra tips. Furthermore, when hotels close down or go bankrupt, the right to priority compensation should be stipulated in the legislation for wages owed, which is only fair. As for guaranteeing security deposits, we propose that your association send a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs to register all large and small hotels in the city, pay attention to their partners and capital amounts, and order them to provide a guarantee method for collecting waiters' security deposits. Those who violate the rules will be banned. In this way, the implementation of the New Life Movement will be smooth and unimpeded. Therefore, we have stated the reasons and submitted this document, requesting your association to review and approve it for the public convenience."</p>
<h3>Twenty Counterfeit Bills Found in Rattan Basket: Shen Shirong Claims to Have Purchased Them; Police Dispatched to Arrest, But Unsuccessful</h3>

<h3>Murdered Female Corpse in Gunny Sack Examined by Court; Packet of White Powder Found in Stocking; Sent to Forensic Pathologist for Testing Before Further Review</h3>
<p>At 5:42 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese Constable No. 1465 of the Hongkou Police Station was patrolling on McTaggart Road when he was informed that there was a discarded gunny sack in front of No. 192 on the road. Upon inspection, the constable found a female corpse, approximately 50 years old, with 17 knife wounds. After being informed, the police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The body was then transported to the forensic examination office on Fieland Road to await examination. All details have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Tang, appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic pathologist Zhang Yan and a clerk, arrived at the office to examine the body. Forensic pathologist Zhang and a doctor from the Municipal Council determined that the body had died 24 hours before it was discovered. After the detectives reported the investigation process, they stated that the body was hidden inside two gunny sacks sewn together. Three silver hairpins were found on the deceased's hair, and a small mirror with duck eggs on the side of her body, and a packet of white powder inside her left stocking. When questioned, the congee shop opposite No. 192 stated that they had not seen the gunny sack at 3:00 AM that morning. According to Lv Wenfu, who set up a bean curd stall at No. 194 McTaggart Road, at around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, he saw two or three passersby kicking and looking at the gunny sack, so he reported it to the Chinese constables. Based on Tang's testimony, the unidentified female corpse was confirmed to have been stabbed to death with a knife. Before the relatives are identified, the corpse will be handed over to the Pushan Junta for collection. The police station responsible for the case should strictly investigate and arrest the murderers. The white powder brought to the court by the Chinese detective will be handed over to the forensic pathologist for testing. As for the packet of white powder, it was hidden in a toothpaste powder bag, so it remains to be seen whether it is a drug or toothpaste powder. It needs to be clarified after the forensic pathologist's examination.</p>
<h3>Accused of Murder: Wang Daoren Continues Trial; Released on Bail of 5,000 Yuan with Guarantor; Hearing Adjourned to the 16th</h3>
<p>Wang Daoren, a doctor at Jianhua Electrotherapy Hospital, No. 13 Nianwu New Village, Foch Road, and Zheng Kewen, a native of Hubei and former owner of the New Era Dance Research Society at the intersection of Route Edward VII and Danshui Road, along with his mother, Zheng Pan, hired a lawyer to sue Wang in the First Special Court's criminal division for posing as a doctor and causing death by administering drugs. The civil lawsuit was related to Zheng Pan's adopted son, Zeng Qiunian, 21, who suddenly suffered from diarrhea on July 6th of this year. Wang Daoren, being a member of the New Era Dance Research Society and residing there to learn dancing, became acquainted with Zeng Qiu. Upon learning of Zeng Qiu's illness, Wang Daoren volunteered, claiming he could cure the illness with medicine. He then gave Zeng Qiu two kinds of yellow and black pills on the 9th. Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, Zeng Qiu's health deteriorated rapidly, and he was bedridden until he died. The plaintiffs accused Wang Daoren of violating Article 271 of the Criminal Code for murder. This case had already been heard twice by Judge Yi Xinzhen, who ordered Wang Daoren to provide a bail of 10,000 yuan while awaiting trial. However, Wang was unable to find such a large sum and was detained. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan resumed the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant hired lawyer Sun Shian to defend him. However, the plaintiff suddenly accused the defendant of intentional homicide. Judge Tan considered the circumstances of the case to be serious and found it necessary to postpone the hearing for further investigation. The defendant's representative, lawyer Sun, requested a reduction in bail. Judge Tan ruled that the defendant was allowed to reduce the bail to 5,000 yuan and find a guarantor, with the next hearing adjourned to September 16th.</p>
<h3>Flatbread Shop Owner Wields Knife, Forces Mistress to Flee Together; Also Instigated Husband's Murder; Case Concluded Pending Judgment</h3>
<p>Liu Dashun, 25, a native of Yancheng and the owner of a flatbread shop on Fangbang Road in the city, was having an affair with Lin Teng, the wife of Lin Genrong, who owned a tofu shop nearby. On the 6th of last month, Liu, seeking a long-term relationship, instigated Lin Teng to kill her husband and flee with him. However, Lin Teng's conscience prevailed, and she refused to do so.

<h3>Dance Academy's Content Empty; Founder Turns Thief; Stealing Students' Clothes for Pawn; Original Thief Found in Changyuan Pawnshop</h3>
<p>Qian Fusheng (also known as Xue Rong, 23 years old), a native of Suzhou, recently founded the New Star Dance Academy at No. 5 Chunshou Lane, at the intersection of Xinza Road and Route Albert. He also ran a business providing guides and dance partners and advertised for students to learn dance. Zhou Juexin from Zhejiang and Lin Zexing from Taiwan enrolled and lived in the academy to study dance. However, the academy was underfunded and its content was empty. Its guide service had no permanent members and only hired temporary help. On the 1st of this month, a suitcase belonging to Zhou Juexin, placed in the academy, containing several pieces of clothing and five yuan in French currency, disappeared. After reporting the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, detective Shi Huanting discovered that the theft was committed by Qian and Ren Dusheng from Shaoxing, an employee. They pawned the items at Changyuan Pawnshop, No. 872 Xinza Road, for two silver dollars. After redeeming the items, the five yuan in French currency was still there. Qian and Ren were immediately arrested. Several pawn tickets were found on them and brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, sent them to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court, charging them with theft under Article 320, Section 1, of the Criminal Code. He also stated that Lin Zexing, a student at the academy, had reported to the police station that his large suitcase had also been stolen, containing many clothes. The investigation is still ongoing, so he requested a postponement. Judge Dai Rongduo interrogated the two defendants, Qian and Ren, and ordered a postponement for further questioning. Qian and Ren were each granted bail of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zhang Accused of Abusing Maid</h3>
<p>Zhang Ximeng, 36, a native of Fuzhou, is a lieutenant in the Naval Department's Jiankang gunboat. His wife, Jiang Zhang, 37, is from the same hometown and lives at No. 11 Paris New Village, Route Lupan in the French Concession. In 1932, through the introduction of Xi Laowu (also known as Xi Xinchuan), they purchased an orphaned girl named Caiyin (now eight years old) to be a maid. However, Jiang Zhang was inherently violent and often beat Caiyin. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, around 4:00 PM, Jiang Zhang, again for a trivial matter, used a feather duster to whip the girl, causing bruises on her right arm and back. Someone, taking pity on the girl, reported the incident to the French police by phone. Detective Wang Zhongfang rushed to investigate and confirmed that the maid Caiyin had been beaten and injured. Jiang Zhang was taken to the police station. The girl was first sent to Guangci Hospital to verify the injuries pending further investigation. However, the defendant, Jiang Zhang, was in the final month of her pregnancy. During questioning at the police station, she frequently complained of abdominal pain. Fearing that she would go into labor, the police chief ordered her to be sent to the Obstetrics Department of Guangci Hospital to await childbirth. Yesterday morning, the police station transferred Caiyin to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police department's lawyer, Yuan Jiahuan, explained the case and prosecuted Jiang Zhang for assault. Detective Wang Zhongfang reported that the police station received a phone call on the afternoon of the 2nd at 5:00 PM, reporting Jiang Zhang's abuse of her adopted daughter. According to Caiyin, she was eight years old and was purchased by the defendant, Jiang Zhang's relative, Xi Laowu (Xi Xinchuan), in Nanjing in 1933 for 50 yuan to be a maid. Caiyin testified that she was beaten by the mistress with a feather duster on the afternoon of the 2nd at 4:00 PM. However, the defendant, Jiang Zhang, was in the hospital awaiting childbirth and was not present. Judge Chen Shuoying reviewed the evidence and ordered a postponement to the morning of the 10th for further hearing. The victim, Caiyin, was sent to the forensic department for injury examination and temporarily kept in custody pending review.</p>
<h3>Enraged by Matchmaker's Affair with Wife; Murder in Toilet; Zhang Pinfu Chops with Ax; Self-Inflicted Knife Wounds After Incident</h3>
<p>Zhang Pinfu (also known as Wu Pinfu, Xiao Wuxi, 24 years old), a native of Wuxi, lives at No. 14 Deyuan Lane, Yangshupu, and works as a coppersmith in the machinery room of the Shanghai Electric Power Company on the same road. In May of this year, Wang Jiasheng (45 years old), a coppersmith from Suzhou, acted as a matchmaker and married him to a woman named Afeng. Later, he learned that Afeng and Wang had an ambiguous relationship, leading to deep resentment. Recently, company workers often ridiculed Zhang, saying that Wang had leaked the secret.</p>
<p>Zhang was extremely humiliated. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, he saw Wang enter the toilet to defecate. Zhang obtained a triangular sharp blade from the machinery room and followed him in. Without saying a word, he pulled out the blade and stabbed Wang's head and abdomen, inflicting five wounds to the head and two to the abdomen. Wang collapsed to the ground in agony, crying for help. Zhang, knowing that he had committed a great crime, stabbed his own left leg to lessen his guilt and ran into the office, reporting to the Western staff member, Kleinmann, that Wang Jiasheng had stabbed him in the leg. Later, it was discovered that Wang had been stabbed in the toilet,</p>
<p>seriously injured,</p>
<p>and on the verge of death. Wang and Zhang were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. Zhang seized the opportunity to escape and telegraphed the Yangshupu police station. Detective Chief Liu Wenzao, detective Su Yinggen, and detectives Zhang Guanying and Liu Changgen investigated and learned that Zhang Pinfu was hiding at his sister's place at No. 14 Xi Junan Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei. They rushed there and arrested him with the help of the Public Security Bureau's detectives. He was taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, the police department's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu,</p>
<p>explained the case</p>
<p>to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. He filed a public prosecution under Article 171, Section 2, of the Criminal Code for murder. He also stated that the victim, Wang Jiasheng, was seriously injured in the hospital and might die. He requested a postponement and presented the doctor's injury report. Detective Liu reported the process of arresting the defendant and handed over the murder weapon and Wang Jiasheng's blood-stained felt hat and clothes as evidence. The Western staff member, Kleinmann, and the workers in the same truck, Chen Genfu, testified that two months ago, they heard others say that Wang and Zhang's wife had</p>
<p>a physical relationship, and Zhang wanted to kill Wang. Judge Zhong Qing questioned the defendant, who stated that Wang Jiasheng initially acted as a matchmaker, then tricked the woman into a hotel for sexual intercourse and he saw it. The next morning, they walked out together. After marriage, he repeatedly induced the wife to go out for secret dates, and in the company, he said that his wife was promiscuous and indecent. That is why he committed this crime. The rest of the confession was evasive. Wang's wife, Liu, stated that her husband acted as a matchmaker and did not have any improper advances towards Afeng. The defendant's accusation was false and requested judgment. Judge Zhong Qing ordered Zhang Pinfu to be returned to custody for further verification at a later date.</p>

<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Discusses Repairing Suiyuan Minsheng Canal</h3>
<p>The Minsheng Canal is located in central Suiyuan Province, spanning the two counties of Salaqi and Tuoketuo. The canal entrance is located 30 li east of Baotou Town. Its irrigation area is bounded by the Yellow River to the southwest, the Ping Sui Railway to the north, and the Dahei River to the east, and can irrigate 1.2 million mu of farmland. It was opened in 1928. At that time, Suiyuan Province was experiencing a severe drought. The authorities planned to use work relief to excavate the canal, drawing water from the Yellow River for irrigation. That autumn, disaster victims were collected and engaged in excavation. By the summer of 1929, a main canal of 40 kilometers had been completed. Later, the Suiyuan provincial authorities, believing that the China International Famine Relief Commission was dedicated to construction and disaster prevention and had achieved remarkable results in managing domestic water conservancy and transportation projects, requested that it take over this project. The commission then re-surveyed and changed the original route and continued the work. By 1932, it had completed one main canal, eight branch canals, one water inlet gate at the canal entrance, two water blocking gates in the main canal, nine gate valves in the branch canals, eight large bridges in the main canal, and six wooden bridges in the branch canals, with a total expenditure of 750,000 yuan. Except for 300,000 yuan subsidized by the Suiyuan Provincial Government, the rest was allocated by the commission. At that time, the donations had been exhausted, and it was difficult to continue. Therefore, the various projects were transferred to the Suiyuan Water Conservancy Association for acceptance, while the commission still assumed the responsibility of technical guidance. It also completed one main canal outlet and four wooden bridges, and two branch canal gates. The western part of the canal project was completed. The sluice gate was opened for irrigation in the autumn of 1933, but incessant rain caused the river to rise sharply. The southern part of the canal was submerged by the Yellow River, and the northern part was eroded by mountain floods. Severe siltation occurred in the upper part of the main canal, and the irrigation goal was not achieved. The Water Conservancy Association also could not continue due to financial constraints, resulting in the suspension of the huge project, which the society deeply regretted. The commission also regretted not finishing the project. Now that the Jianghuai flood relief work has ended, it plans to carry out various construction projects to prevent drought in accordance with its usual purpose. It believes that the canal project has been suspended for a long time. If it is not quickly resumed, not only will the nearby farmland be difficult to irrigate, but also the siltation will make dredging more difficult over time. It dispatched engineer Zhang Jichun to inspect and propose a repair plan, dividing the project into two parts: repairing existing buildings and dredging silt. The estimated cost is over 100,000 yuan. It was submitted to the commission's executive committee for discussion last month. It was suggested that the project was large and costly and that the provincial authorities should cooperate fully. It was decided to allocate 10,000 yuan first to repair the original buildings. All dredging costs will be shared equally between the commission and the Suiyuan Provincial Government. Consent has been sought, and construction will begin separately after consultation.</p>
<h3>Lu Bingsheng's Illness Confirmed; Temporary Suspension of Imprisonment Approved; Embezzlement Case Sentenced to One Year and Six Months; Appeal Rejected, Sentence Final</h3>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a Suzhou merchant in the real estate business, and his son Lu Bingsheng, embezzled 239,000 yuan in bank notes and silver dollars while serving as president and vice president of the Bank of Communications from January 9, 1934, to May 6, 1935. The head office reported this to the police station, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special Court. They were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, while Lu Shaotang received a suspended sentence. Lu Bingsheng refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch Court. As a result, the appeal was rejected. However, Lu's request was approved, and he was allowed to post a bail of 100,000 yuan before the judgment was finalized. Yang Songsheng, who lived at No. 346 Haige Road, acted as his guarantor. Now that the case has been finalized, the First Special Court's execution office ordered Lu to report for execution of the sentence. However, Lu Bingsheng claimed to be ill and applied for a temporary suspension of execution. The court confirmed that he was indeed ill and ordered the execution to be suspended. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen opened the Ninth Criminal Court to continue the execution. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu also appeared in court. Lu Bingsheng, accompanied by lawyer Ye Shaoying, stated that he had not yet recovered and requested that the previous ruling be maintained and the execution suspended. Judge Shen ordered him to go to the forensic department for examination. Since the examination confirmed that he was ill, he ordered Lu Bingsheng to continue to provide the original guarantee, suspend the execution, and not to leave Shanghai. He was subject to recall at any time.</p>
<h3>Demand for 300 Cash in Gambling Debt; Right Leg Chopped Off; Bloodshed in Zhabei Civilian Village; Xia Yingnian Chops Xia Quangen</h3>
<p>Xia Yingnian, 22, a native of Yancheng, lives at a certain number in the Zhabei Civilian Village. At around 10:00 PM last night, Xia demanded 300 cash in gambling debt from his fellow townsman, Xia Quangen. Quangen refused to pay a single cent, leading to an argument. Xia Yingnian then pulled out an ax and chopped off Xia Quangen's right leg. Xia was injured on the spot and collapsed, bleeding profusely. Nearby police officers arrived and arrested the suspect. The injured person was taken to Pushan Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Mountain Merchant Lodges in Hotel; Paper Money and Gold Jewelry Stolen</h3>
<p>Han Zelai, 23, a mountain merchant from Ningbo who sells seafood and grains from Xiaodongmen, arrived in Shanghai from Sheng on the 31st of last month. He carried a suitcase (containing 56 yuan and 50 cents in paper money, a gold ring weighing 3 qian, and several pieces of gold jewelry). Upon arriving at the shore, he went to the Central Hotel on Minguo Road and opened room number 18 on the third floor, placing the suitcase under the bed. At around 7:00 AM the other day, he went out for medical treatment. When he returned to the hotel, he saw that the suitcase under the bed seemed to have been moved. He immediately opened it to check and found that the paper money and gold jewelry had disappeared. He immediately questioned the bellboys. However, three or four bellboys entered and exited the room and all claimed not to know anything. However, one of the bellboys, named Kuai Ahu (27 years old, from Suzhou), said, "You have six or seven guests living together in one room. According to our hotel rules, guests with valuables should entrust them to the cashier for safekeeping. We cannot be responsible." Observing his behavior, he was highly suspicious. He immediately reported this to the Yimiao Police Station and requested an investigation. Police Chief Gong was dispatched to summon Kuai Ahu for questioning. It was learned that although the person claimed not to know the details of the stolen property, he should at least bear some responsibility. Both sides took extreme positions, and the case was sent to the bureau for handling.</p>
<h3>Two Young Girls Missing; Rewards for Information</h3>
<p>The Tang family, residing outside Ximen (West Gate), has two young daughters, Tang Xuejia and Tang Shaomei, both 17 years old, who suddenly went missing at the same time a few days ago. They have been searched everywhere without success. Fearing that they have been lured, abducted, and sold by bandits, the family will report this to the Laoximen Public Security Bureau and request that all bureaus be notified to pay attention to the investigation. If there is any information, please notify the Ximen Bureau. If they are found as a result, there will be a generous reward.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Trade Announcement: Gu Ben Soap Complimentary Replenishment Begins</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Trade Association's South Shanghai office previously requested the company to replenish the Gu Ben soap at a uniform price due to the price drop of the soap. Now, the company, out of consideration for the industry, has begun to provide complimentary replenishment. The office specifically announced to its members that: "Our association's member stores, which sell Gu Ben soap produced by the Wuzhou Pharmacy, are managed by the Dacheng Company, located in Baokang Lane, Touji Bridge, Zhejiang Road. The company plans to expand its business and has reduced the price from August 15th. The members with inventory will receive six complimentary bars per box. Member stores without a similar affiliation will not receive any replenishment. As a result, the stores requested this office to negotiate with the company to request registration and uniform replenishment to show fairness. After this office sent a letter, the company, out of consideration for the industry and because there has been no profit from the sale of Gu Ben soap, felt that it would be unfair not to provide replenishment this time. From September 2nd, it has dispatched sales runners to investigate and provide replenishment to the stores on a household basis. However, considering that there are many members and a wide area, this office is concerned that the company's runners may miss some members. Therefore, this announcement is made to inform your esteemed store that if there is any old-price Gu Ben soap inventory, whether registered or not, you can directly request the company to replenish it. Or, please provide a detailed explanation of the reasons and notify this office in writing within ten days so that we can request replenishment again. Please do not delay and suffer losses. This is a special announcement."</p>
<h3>Ximen Police Branch Bureau Chief Yao Guangnai Promotes Police Affairs</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Yao Guangnai, the chief of the Ximen Police Branch Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has spared no effort in promoting police affairs. Whenever a case occurs, he personally leads police officers to handle it. He also regularly summons patrol officers and police chiefs from various police stations for training, demanding that they abide by police discipline and be loyal to their duties. Recently, to strictly supervise duty performance, he has dispatched police officers to rotate and report on duty between 1:00 AM and 6:00 AM every night to determine rewards and punishments.</p>
<h3>Yaohua Glass Company: Belgian Equity Transferred to Japan</h3>
<p>According to a previous report, Japan Telecom transferred the Qinhuangdao Glass Company to Japan. According to those familiar with the company's inside information, the telegram was too simple and deviated from the facts. The Yaohua Machinery Glass Co., Ltd. in Qinhuangdao is jointly funded by Chinese and Belgian merchants. The Belgian side has a company in Brussels, Belgium, which Japan Telecom refers to as the Qinhuangdao Glass Company. This transfer to the Japanese side is only this part of the equity and has nothing to do with the Chinese merchant's equity. Also, the Kai'ao Mining Bureau is the company's manager, which is an appointed management relationship. Kai'ao itself has no equity relationship.</p>
<h3>Girl Yang Amei Lost; Family Can Claim at Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>At 6:50 PM on the 1st of this month, police chief Chen Menglin of the Taixing Street Police Station of the Wusong Police Station found a lost girl named Yang Amei near Yangjia River.

If anyone has lost the above child, they can claim her at the Relief Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on Penglai Road.</p>
<h3>Yan Shao Line: Hongnan Steamer Taken Over</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Yonglong Steamer Bureau's Hongnan steamer has been operating the Shaobo to Yancheng route for years. Its perfect equipment and high speed have been welcomed by passengers and has earned a good reputation. Last month, the bureau's shareholders decided not to continue operating, so it announced its closure. It is now known that Xu Dechang and Wang Fenglou have taken over. Xu and Wang are both veterans of the steamer industry and have a good reputation in the navigation industry. It is said that with a little reorganization, the line can be opened, which will make a great contribution to the local transportation.</p>

<h3>This Year's Second Quarter Shanghai Industry and Commerce Change Report (Continued) (Thirty-Fifth Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Bureau</p>
<p>B. Changes in Major Industrial and Commercial Firms in June</p>
<p>A. Special Industries</p>
<p>1.  Tung Yee Trust Company Ceases Operations and Liquidates - This company was established in July of the tenth year of the Republic of China and has been in operation for fifteen years. Its fixed capital was 2.5 million national currency, with 1.36 million actually paid up. Mr. Huang Suchu, the chairman of the board, also served as general manager. It specialized in banking, trust, savings, insurance, and other businesses. Branches were established in Beiping, Hangzhou, and Suzhou, with insurance sub-bureaus and savings departments in Guangzhou, Hankou, Nanjing, and Haimen. Its daily operations focused on savings, with deposits reaching 5 million yuan at its peak. However, since the Shanghai War and the spread of economic depression throughout the country, the phenomenon of capital flight became increasingly apparent. The collapse of Tung Yee Bank in the 23rd year had a significant impact on the company due to the similarity in name. Furthermore, the market was depressed, investments in industry were difficult to recover, investments in real estate suffered from a sharp drop in land prices, and the government's unification of public bonds greatly affected securities operations. In addition, the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident led to a surge in withdrawals, reaching 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per day. As a result, deposits rapidly decreased to over 2 million yuan. The summer festival and the bank's semi-annual settlement period were approaching, and money shops were planning to withdraw loans at a rate of 3.6%, coupled with a loss of nearly 100,000 yuan due to a failed speculation in 10,000 bales of cotton yarn. By the evening of the 15th, some bills could not be cashed, leading to a lack of funds. Although the board of directors and supervisors made every effort to salvage the situation, they were ultimately unable to reverse the inevitable. The company had no choice but to declare bankruptcy on the 16th.</p>
<p>2.  Sze Ming Bank Increases Capital - The bank's original paid-up capital was 2.25 million national currency. Last month, at the bank's 28th annual shareholders' meeting, the board of directors proposed increasing commercial shares by 1.75 million yuan, bringing the total capital to 4 million yuan. This proposal was approved by the attending shareholders in a preliminary resolution. Later, on the 21st of this month, a second general meeting was held, and the stock offering was officially approved.</p>
<p>3.  Municipal Council Invests in Bank's Reopening - The bank was established by the Municipal Council but ceased operations after the sale of the Council's Electric Administration in the 18th year of the Republic of China. At that time, because someone purchased the Electric Administration, the proceeds from the sale were sufficient to meet all major needs, so the bank was closed. Recently, the Municipal Council board of directors, based on the recommendation of the head of the Finance Department, decided to restore the bank's operations in view of the sales of municipal public bonds this year. It began accepting deposits on June 1st. The main purpose of the bank's business is to provide citizens with various conveniences for investing in municipal bonds and also to provide the Municipal Council with a reliable source of funds. On May 5th and November 5th each year, an appropriate portion of each household's deposit will be transferred to the Municipal Council to purchase municipal bonds.</p>
<p>4.  In the shipping industry, the closure of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Inland River Steamship Administration has also attracted much attention. The administration was directly under the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and was a joint public-private limited liability company. It had a total of twenty inland river steamships and twenty cargo ships and tugboats. Over the years, business has been poor. After the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company took back the administration's business for self-management, it made every effort to reorganize. However, it was ultimately difficult to maintain due to excessive debt, and the development of highway transportation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang in recent years has made inland river navigation practically obsolete, with little hope of recovery. Therefore, Mr. Lao Mian, who also served as manager, had no choice but to report the reorganization process and difficulties to the Ministry of Transportation for approval. The ministry ordered the cessation of operations and the sale of all ships. A shareholders' meeting was convened on the 25th of this month to report the actual situation of the closure to all shareholders.</p>
<p>5.  In the entertainment industry, the opening of the Sun Sun Amusement Park on the 21st of this month was also an important change. The park is located from the fifth floor to the roof of the Sun Sun Company and is extremely spacious. After the Sun Sun Company completed the arrangements, it was contracted by the Xingfa Company to open for business. Therefore, although the park belongs to the Sun Sun Company, the business responsibility is entirely borne by the Xingfa Company. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<p>English Football Association Announces Two Rule Changes for This Season - Kicking Goal Kicks and Free Kicks Within the Penalty Area</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association received two rule changes announced by the English Football Association for this season yesterday. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Add a sentence to Article 1, Chapter 7: (Goal kicks must be kicked outside the penalty area line.)</p>
<p>"Explanation" In the past, it was customary for defenders to pass the ball to the goalkeeper for a goal kick. The current rule stipulates that only one player is allowed to kick the ball directly out of the penalty area. If the ball fails to be kicked out of the penalty area, the referee will order a retake. However, the kicker is not allowed to kick the ball twice. Violators will be penalized with a free kick.</p>
<p>(2) Add two sentences to Article 1, Chapter 10: When a free kick is awarded within the penalty area, the penalized team's players must defend on the goal line.</p>
<p>"Explanation" In the past, players on the penalized team could form a wall to defend freely. The current rule stipulates that they are only allowed to make this defensive formation on the goal line.</p>
<p>Two New Chinese Teams Participate in the Hong Kong First Division Football League - Kowloon Chinese and Eastern will mostly consist of veterans from the Chinese Athletic Association</p>
<p>Hong Kong News - With the passing of summer and the arrival of autumn, the annual Hong Kong's highly anticipated League Cup regular football competition is about to begin. Since the Football Association announced the dates for the upcoming competition, all participating teams have been preparing, recruiting personnel, and strengthening their forces in order to compete with other teams in the future. With only ten days or so until the start of the competition, it has been found that the number of teams participating in the upcoming First Division competition will be the same as last year, with fourteen teams. Of particular note is that the Kowloon Chinese and Eastern teams have achieved their wish to participate in the First Division. Initially, the Football Association rejected the requests of the two teams, wanting to limit the number of First Division teams to no more than two Chinese teams. However, the two teams believed that the Association's refusal was not justified and filed an appeal. As a result, the Association's Appeals Committee held a meeting on the evening of the 27th of last month. The outcome was that the Appeals Committee found the reasons for the appeal of the two teams to be sufficient and overturned the decision of the Competition Committee, approving the requests of the two teams. Thus, this appeal incident came to an end. Therefore, the upcoming First Division competition will have two more Chinese teams. When the time comes for fierce competition, it will surely be even more heated. It has been found that the players of the Kowloon Chinese team are all top-notch players, such as Xu Yahui, Chen Zhenhe, Mai Su, He Zuoxian, Li Guozhao, and Chen Yinpei, all of whom are experienced players and also former First Division stars of the Chinese Athletic Association. Therefore, the strength of this team is a great threat to all teams in Hong Kong. In addition to setting up a general office at 174-176 Boundary Street, Kowloon, the team plans to set up a branch office near Happy Valley to facilitate all aspects of operations. Since the competition is approaching, the person in charge of the team specifically telegraphed to Guangzhou to summon Li Guozhao and others to Hong Kong to meet at 1:00 PM yesterday to discuss team affairs and competition matters. This reporter, considering the importance of the matter, paid a special visit to Mr. Chen Guiben, the person in charge of the team, to inquire about everything. According to him, "Since our team won the appeal, we have been actively working on the competition. Regarding the players, we have received enthusiastic participation from many players from the former Chinese Athletic Association, which is generally settled. As for the team members, in addition to myself and Mr. Ye Jiugao and Mr. Li Huimin, there are many others. We will only be able to formally announce them after the election of officials this Sunday (the 6th). Regarding the stadium, we have already sent someone to contact the Hong Kong Club. Once we have negotiated, we will be able to make a decision. We are about 90% sure. Currently, the players who have already signed up to participate include Hu Tianbao, Chen Hongguang, He Zuoxian, Huang Yongkang, Mai Su, Chen Guopei, Ou Bingming, Xu Yahui, Huang Xiang, Zou Wenzhi, Chen Zhenhe, Deng Guangsen, Li Guozhao, Fu Jiaxing (another defender and left winger from Guangzhou will participate, but their names cannot be announced due to certain reasons). Yang Genbao and Zhang Manrong are planning to participate but have not yet signed up. The Second Division players include Xian Chifen, Du Keheng, Huang Jiajie, Ye Defang, Lu Hongyun, Chen Guangyu, and Liu Xianhan (Mr. Chen and Mr. Liu are champions of this year's mini-football), who are also rare talents. Regarding the opening of the competition, because Xu, Chen, and Mai are representing our country at the World Games and will not be able to return in time, it has been decided to send others to supplement them. However, it is not yet certain whether Fu Jiaxing will be able to play due to his official trip to Lanzhou, Gansu Province. It was also learned that Li Guozhao returned to Guangzhou on the last train last night after being summoned to Hong Kong for a meeting yesterday. It is said that Li is determined to train actively in Guangzhou in preparation."</p>
<p>Shen Silang Arrives in Shanghai This Morning - Arrived in Tianjin the Day Before Yesterday and Took the Beijing-Shanghai Through Train South, Expected to Arrive at 7:40 AM This Morning</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Silang, the head of the Chinese delegation and representative to the 11th Asian Games in Europe, left Europe on the 20th of last month, after the closing ceremony of the Games, to return to the country via the Siberian Railway, as the opening of the academic year at St. John's University in Shanghai was imminent, and he could not leave his position as Dean of Academic Affairs for a day. He first arranged all matters for the arrival of the delegation in Shanghai. According to Mrs. Shen, who spoke to a reporter from the Guoguang News Agency yesterday, Mr. Shen passed through Tianjin the day before yesterday and took the Beijing-Shanghai train south. He is expected to pass through Nanjing last night and arrive in Shanghai at 7:40 AM this morning. Mr. Shen is the first person to return from the Asian Games in person, and it is expected that he will have a lot of accurate news to announce to the people of the country.</p>

<p>Forbes Narrowly Defeats Ma Anquan</p>
<p>The senior singles semifinal between Ma Anquan and Forbes was resolved yesterday. Ma first won two sets in a row with scores of 6-2 and 6-0. After that, the competition became extremely fierce, but every time it came to a critical moment, he was taken advantage of by his opponent's slow, grinding style. As a result, Forbes won a set in a row, although the scores were 1-6, 1-6, and 2-6. However, the scores of each game were very close, and the number of equal points was almost every game, which shows that Ma did not lose due to inferior skills. It was really Forbes's high luck. Forbes is now scheduled to play Kolasa in the semifinal of the Qiu Feihai Memorial Tournament tomorrow.</p>

<p>Account of Our Country's Athletes Participating in the Expedition (Eleventh Letter) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</p>
<p>(5) (3) Basketball Team Unsuccessful - Initial Battle Lost to Japan</p>
<p>The seventh day of the Games marked the start of the first week of basketball competition, with a total of nine matches. In addition, there was a match between the United States and Spain. However, Spain did not participate in the Games. A match between the Czech Republic and Hungary also resulted in Hungary's forfeit, and the Philippines had a bye. All advanced to the second week without effort.</p>
<p>Of the nine matches, the match between China and Japan attracted the most interest from the audience. More than 2,000 people went to watch, which was very different from the cold and quiet atmosphere of other matches.</p>
<p>On our country's side, whether they were delegation staff or athletes, or students studying in Europe, everyone was extremely concerned about the outcome of this match. One reason was that all other sports had failed, and only basketball had hope of progress. The other reason was that everyone hoped to beat the Japanese basketball team, which had always been defeated by us, in front of the Europeans. Therefore, almost all Chinese people in Berlin, from Dean Dai and Ambassador Cheng onwards, were mobilized. Students studying in Germany and students studying in other European countries who came to Berlin to visit the Games organized a cheering squad to cheer on the team. They cheered and shouted very neatly on the field, which was in stark contrast to the Japanese side, which only had one person holding a national flag and singing a solo act. However, the result of the match was that we were defeated by Japan, and the defeat was very惨 (can3 - tragic, miserable), which was like pouring a bucket of cold water over everyone's heads. Everyone was discouraged and dejected. The players, in particular, suffered a great blow. After the match, they were all stunned and, when they returned to the Olympic Village, cried bitterly and were filled with sadness. The stimulus given to everyone by this competition was exceptionally tragic. I think when the reporter broadcasted the situation to the country by radio during the competition, the listeners must have been very angry as well. The biggest reason for the failure was that everyone took the outcome of this competition too seriously. The compatriots in Berlin all had the mentality that they could only win and not lose. However, the importance of winning and losing was too great, which had too much impact on the players' mood. Since the order of the matches was drawn on the 27th of last month, the members of the basketball team had been worried about the outcome of this match almost every day. Half of the worry was due to external stimuli, and half was due to internal feelings. Therefore, when they went to the field to compete, everyone's mood was unusually tense, and their nerves were unusually excited. As a result of the tension and excitement, the formation was very chaotic, and their skills were completely abnormal. After Mu Zuoyun opened the scoring under the basket, the Japanese side had four consecutive fouls. Because they were too eager to win and their mood was chaotic, they did not score even once. The Japanese took advantage of the free throw opportunity and scored two out of two, and then scored another point with a throw and a free throw, taking the lead with a score of 5-2. Our team members became even more disoriented as a result. If everyone could have fought calmly and not missed the free throw opportunities, then we would have taken the lead with a score of 6-0 at the beginning, and the momentum would have been completely different. The competition would have become a completely different situation. In total, our team had 13 free throws in the whole match, but only scored three. The Japanese side only missed six out of 17 free throws. The situation is also conceivable. Secondly, the progress of the Japanese side's basketball skills cannot be ignored. They adopted a steady and methodical strategy, with no fancy moves at all, but very solid. When attacking, they found a gap and drilled in like mercury. When defending, the positions were arranged very tightly, and no defects were easily revealed. Their team this time is not comparable to the team at the last Far Eastern Games. We should learn from their spirit of hard training and striving for progress. Coach Dong Shouyi was seriously ill and went to the hospital. There was no one to guide the team during the competition. Captain Wang Yuzeng had just recovered from a minor illness and was not in good physical condition. The outcome of the competition was somewhat affected.</p>
<p>Hard Work in the First Half</p>
<p>After the opening, the Japanese team once shot at our basket but missed. Our team immediately took the offensive, passing the ball several times. Mu Zuoyun leaped into the air under the basket, broke the net, and opened the scoring. The whole audience cheered and the momentum was full. The Japanese fought back desperately, and their movements were inevitably rough, committing four fouls in a row. Our side let them off lightly. Li Shaotang violated military law, and the Japanese side did not hesitate to score each time. Yokoyama, who was small but courageous and lively, tried his hand at the right corner and hit the bullseye. He then followed up with a free throw, taking the lead with a score of 5-2. Mu Zuoyun and Wang Yuzeng were unwilling to submit and broke through the basket one after another, taking the lead again with a score of 6-5. The Japanese scored again with a free throw, and we fell behind again with a score of 7-6. After that, the Japanese played steadily and advanced by taking advantage of weaknesses, adding eight points in a row. Our side was at a loss. Although Mu and Wang each scored a goal, we still lost the first half with a score of 15-10.</p>
<p>Total Defeat in the Second Half</p>
<p>After resting and fighting again, the Japanese scored again with a free throw. After Xiao Mu fought back with a goal, Li Shaotang's sentence expired and he announced his resignation. Wang Shixuan took the stage and became a general, but his power was not reduced. The Japanese three forwards suddenly became active, scoring twice and making a free throw, taking a remote lead with a score of 20-10. Shen Yugong replaced Mu Zuoyun and gave a warning shot. Wang Yuzeng scored the first free throw, chasing the score to 20-15, which seemed to be a turning point. However, it was a flash in the pan. The good times did not last long. After the Japanese added eight points in a row, Shen Yugong finally scored two points with a free throw. With not much time left, the Japanese adopted a delaying tactic. Our army fought desperately, but instead revealed gaps and gave away five more points. Wang Yuzeng made a long shot, and the Japanese returned the favor in the same way. The game ended, and our side suffered a惨 (can3 - tragic, miserable) defeat with a score of 35-19.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in the local news column of your newspaper on August 28 concerning a labor dispute at the China Battery Factory. The report stated that Zhu Yichen ganged up with Yang Ziliang, Huang Chenglin, and others to kidnap Xiao Shunquan and illegally detain him in room 78 of the Dahua Hotel at Xixin Bridge, threatening Xiao Shunquan to return to Yangzhou immediately and not work in Shanghai. Zhu did not express anything, and he was detained without freedom, etc. Upon investigation, our factory previously had a dispute due to discord among the workers, which has been mediated and resolved. The news reported above is not entirely consistent with the facts and is likely based on inaccurate rumors. We are concerned about misunderstandings from all sectors. Therefore, we have specially prepared this letter to clarify and request your newspaper to correct it. Please forward this to the Editor of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hu Guoguang, Manager of China Battery Factory</p>

<p>For the Adjustment of the Chinese Buddhist Association: A Notice to Monks and Nuns Nationwide (Continued). By Zhang Tinghao. (4) Regulations on Annual Donations</p>
<p>Annual donations are, in a sense, not a new addition. In January of last year, the Chinese Buddhist Association itself had already formulated a set of rules for temples to establish charitable and public welfare undertakings, which were submitted to the Ministry of Interior for record. However, because the rules were mostly formulated by abbots of large monasteries with higher incomes, the percentage was set high for temples and nunneries with lower incomes, and conversely, low for temples and nunneries with higher incomes. It should be known that the majority of temples and nunneries nationwide have lower incomes. According to the percentage set by those rules, those with an income of one hundred yuan donate one percent. Assuming that each such temple has three resident monks, an income of one hundred yuan is already very difficult to maintain the clothing and food of three people throughout the year, but they still have to donate one percent. While those with an income of tens of thousands of yuan, whose numbers may not increase proportionally, and whose expenses, if not abused, may not particularly increase, donate the same as those with an income of one thousand yuan, which is only five percent. Isn't this clearly showing favoritism and being too unfair? Monks and nuns practicing asceticism and self-discipline are originally their duty, but they cannot completely disregard their livelihoods. Moreover, if there is unequal treatment among monks and nuns, it further violates the Buddhist doctrine of equality. Compared with the original rules, the draft charter reduces the percentage for those with lower incomes and appropriately increases the percentage for those with higher incomes, based solely on facts and seeking fairness. Moreover, the purpose of the donations is to conduct education and charitable public welfare undertakings. If monks and nuns understand the Buddhist spirit of altruism, they should not oppose it against their conscience.</p>
<p>Since I welcome monks and nuns nationwide to express their opinions on the draft charter as much as possible, as long as the reasons are sufficient, the opinions of opponents can certainly be accommodated. However, regarding the recent letter from the current Standing Council of the Chinese Buddhist Association to all directors and supervisors for distributing research on the draft charter I proposed, the point about abolishing provincial associations and adopting a two-level system was clearly advocated by the previous council of the association. Before the 7th National Congress, it was submitted to the former Central People's Movement Committee to request modification. The former People's Movement Committee listed the points to be considered and ordered further research. After the association replied, explaining in detail, the former People's Movement Committee only temporarily approved it for record after the 7th National Congress. But the letter says, "Following the instructions of the Central Government to improve, the Buddhist associations of each province were abolished," pushing the proposal to abolish provincial Buddhist associations onto the Central Government. And in the "Hai Chao" Volume 17, No. 7, such as the articles "Jinshan Conference and Central Opinions," "Regarding the Chinese Buddhist Association Incident," and "Reviewing the Central Amendment Draft from the History of the Chinese Buddhist Association," it is repeatedly said that the Central Civil Training Department sent personnel to participate in guiding the Jinshan Conference, and the Chinese Buddhist Association is currently suspended from activities. According to the facts, Director Wu of the Civil Training Department went to Zhenjiang clearly to stop the meeting, not to guide the meeting. The Civil Training Department and the Ministry of Interior have also not suspended the activities of the Chinese Buddhist Association. These various cunning means of deliberately obliterating the facts and deceiving themselves not only intend to lie to monks and nuns nationwide, but are simply disregarding the Central Government. "Falsehood" is one of the Buddhist precepts. Since you have taken the pure precepts of a Buddhist, why imitate the sinister and cunning behavior of politicians? How can you face Shakyamuni? How can you face the monks and nuns nationwide? Buddha emphasizes repentance. Therefore, I hope that those Buddhists who stubbornly hold onto their ego, still want to fight openly and secretly, and are willing to violate precepts and ruin conduct, losing their true faith, will quickly and sincerely repent and no longer have words and deeds that violate Buddhist law, but work together to seek the revival of Chinese Buddhism.</p>
<p>For example, a school was originally very corrupt and had no discipline. Once the education authorities formulated some measures and strictly ordered rectification, at first, in addition to one or two teachers who truly worked for education, of course, not only would the students complain endlessly, but I am afraid that even the teachers who were just filling positions would not feel greatly inconvenienced. However, if the teachers and students can resolve to comply and implement it for a slightly longer period, the school's academic atmosphere will improve, and the students' studies will progress. As a result, the reputation and practical benefits will still be enjoyed by the entire school of teachers and students. This time, I was ordered to adjust the Chinese Buddhist Association and draft the charter of the Buddhist Association. The situation is really similar to this. Abbots and monks and nuns nationwide, do you want the Buddhist Association to be permanently corrupt, or do you hope for rectification?</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Storm Caused Little Damage, Cotton Prices Fell Sharply, Fortunately, Large Traders Covered Short Positions, Leading to a Drop of Only Six or Seven Jiao</h3>
<p>The cotton market had previously rebounded due to excitement about the impending hurricane. However, US cotton suddenly reversed from rising to falling, and the hurricane also passed peacefully. There were no reports of any damage to the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As a result, sentiment rapidly declined, and market prices fell sharply. However, Changhe and others substantially covered their short positions, amounting to a huge sum of nearly 30,000 bales, which helped to maintain market prices.</p>
<p>Changhe Substantially Covered Short Positions</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened in the morning with a sudden fall in US cotton, which had been rising for several days, due to favorable weather conditions. At the same time, the weather in this city was clear, the hurricane had passed, and it had not affected important cotton-producing areas. The new cotton harvest was not expected to be affected in any way. Sentiment was unanimously bearish, and there was a strong selling trend in the market. Prices for near-term contracts fell sharply by seven or eight jiao, while prices for far-term contracts fell by five or six jiao. After the second session, the market stabilized slightly as Changhe and others substantially covered their short positions, vigorously purchasing over 22,000 bales, which strengthened the market. However, Tongji, Hexing, Xingchang, Taichang, Senkang, Changfeng, and other firms sold off heavily, each reaching 5,000 to 6,000 bales. The closing price was down 6.5 to 8 jiao from the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon with Changhe continuing to cover short positions, and retail investors also covering their positions, leading to a firming sentiment. Prices rebounded by 2 to 2.5 jiao. However, as the buying trend subsided slightly at the third close, prices softened again. As a result, prices rebounded by 0.5 to 2 jiao from the morning closing price. The sellers included Jifeng (2,000 bales), Dafu (9,000 bales), Tongji (5,200 bales), Yuda (5,800 bales), Hexing (6,700 bales), Gengfeng (2,900 bales), Xingchang (6,800 bales), Senkang (4,700 bales), Taichang (5,500 bales), Changfeng (9,600 bales), Dachang (3,700 bales), Chong'an (4,600 bales), and Yongchang (2,800 bales). The buyers included Hengyi (2,000 bales), Yukang (2,900 bales), Shenji (2,400 bales), Yichengchang (2,800 bales), Yichang (5,700 bales), Runkang (8,900 bales), Shengyuan (6,100 bales), Yongdashun (2,100 bales), Xinchengchang (3,500 bales), and Changhe (28,600 bales). The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Spot Sales are Good, but Raw Cotton is Viewed with Pessimism - Yarn Market is Still Restrained - Loud Calls for Short Selling -</h3>
<p>The yarn market was constrained by the sudden fall in US cotton, which had been rising for days, due to favorable weather conditions and a smooth cotton harvest. Furthermore, the hurricane center did not pass through Shanghai or Hangzhou, and the new cotton harvest was not expected to be affected in any way. The market sentiment toward raw cotton was unanimously bearish. However, current yarn sales are quite encouraging. Merchants from Sichuan, Guangdong, Tianjin, Hunan, and other inland regions have strong demand. Current yarn inventories are dwindling, so the actual position is quite firm.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Falls by More Than Two Yuan</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with US cotton falling by more than ten pounds due to favorable weather conditions for the cotton harvest. The weather in this city was clear, and the hurricane center did not pass through Shanghai. Moreover, its affected area was not wide, and the cotton crop was not affected in any way. The market sentiment toward raw cotton was bearish, and there was a rush to sell. As a result, the market was weak, and prices for all contract months fell sharply by 2.4 to 2.5 yuan. In the second and third sessions, the market stabilized slightly as some investors took profits. However, the closing price softened again. Changfeng bought 4,400 bales exclusively. Hengyi, Mingde, Taichang, Shengyuan, and other firms each bought more than 1,000 bales. Chong'an and Tongji each sold more than 3,000 bales. Gengfeng, Zhenda, Hexing, Yichang, and other firms sold from 1,000 to 2,000 bales. The closing price was down 2.4 to 3.1 yuan from the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon with short covering and strong spot sales, leading to a rebound in sentiment. Prices rose by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan in all contract months. After the third session, the market softened again. As a result, prices rebounded by 0.1 to 0.9 yuan from the morning closing price. The sellers included Jifeng (1,400 bales), Tongji (3,600 bales), Dafeng (900 bales), Daji (1,050 bales), Hexing (900 bales), Gengfeng (2,700 bales), Renfeng (900 bales), Yichang (1,850 bales), and Chong'an (3,100 bales).

The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Also Active in Tianjin</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are becoming increasingly active. Tianjin merchants purchased more than 600 bales of 10-count Cefeiji, Hongxi, Lanfeng, and other yarns. Demand from Hunan, Guangdong, and other regions remains strong. A total of 2,180 bales were traded. Due to the weakness in spot yarn prices, prices fell by about one yuan. The purchase amounts for each region are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin: 642 Inland: 191 Hankou: 30 Nanjing: 15</p>
<p>Guangdong: 300 Changsha: 253 Shantou: 15 Yunnan: 40</p>
<p>Sichuan: 300 Fellow Traders: 245 Xuzhou: 5 Nanyang: 40</p>
<h3>US Cotton Fluctuated Widely, Finally Falling More Than Ten Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with prices unchanged to down three points in all contract months. Private reports indicated rain in West Texas. Cotton farmers were hedging, and local merchants were selling. Liverpool merchants, colleagues, and short sellers bought, and the market improved slightly. However, as sales from the South increased, the market reversed again. Before the government report was released, there were few new accounts, and current demand was calm. There were clouds and rain in the eastern cotton region, and the weather was good in the central region and Louisiana. There were clouds in Mississippi and the western region, and there might be rain. The closing price was weak, with spot prices down ten points and futures prices down eight to sixteen points. English spot cotton rose by eight points, and futures prices rose and fell by one point. Indian cotton retail investors were mostly taking profits. European exporters bought, and short sellers covered their positions. The market was firm. Later, long positions were taken, but they were absorbed by colleagues. Bengal rose by one rupee, Oomra rose by 1.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (Telegram on the 3rd).</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Prices are Difficult to Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the direction of the typhoon in this city shifted, and the cotton fields were deemed safe. US cotton fell back, causing sentiment in all sectors to suddenly turn downward. Yarn and cotton prices plummeted across the board, and this city fell again, reverting to the market conditions of the previous day. Amid these sudden rises and falls, sentiment became even more uneasy, and selling pressure was chaotic. A large number of spot goods were sold off at cheap prices. As a result, transactions in this city reached more than 400 pieces. The dyeing factories still absorbed more fine twills. Because demand for dyed twills from merchants gradually increased, the sales volume of fine twills became quite active after being dyed by dyeing factories and transacted by Guangdong merchants. There was strong demand for fine cloth, bleached cloth, printed flannel, colored striped flannel, white shirt flannel, and various types of flower and plain tribute broadcloth and line cloth from Fujian, Guangdong, and other merchants. Because retail sales became increasingly busy after the autumn coolness in various regions, the demand for expedited delivery of orders became more urgent. The factories rushed to deliver the goods. In recent days, a total of 300 pieces have been shipped out daily from Hankou, Nanchang, and other areas. However, due to delays in customs transit procedures for land transport goods, the goods stored and waiting to be shipped by various factories were quite congested, it is said.</p>

<h3>Securities: Major Investors Wait and See, Bond Market Feels More Dull</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market remained sluggish, with trading volumes stagnant and the atmosphere increasingly dull. The number of attendees at the market gatherings dwindled. Major investors remained cautious, while small investors were disheartened, lacking interest and reducing their activity. The overall environment was still in a period of gestation. The day passed uneventfully, with minor fluctuations of one-eighth of a dollar. In the afternoon session, trading continued to be extremely volatile, fluctuating within a small range of one-eighth of a dollar. At the close, the price of security number 53 saw some selling, with half remaining stable and half dropping slightly by one-eighth of a dollar. After days of volatility and gestation, the market has become extremely dull, resembling a state where all things are silent, waiting for rain.

The smallest change was in the deferred E-type stock, down by two and a half cents. Deferred C and D types rose by five cents. The total transaction volume was 3,400,500 yuan. The results of the price changes are listed in the left table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grains: Expectations for Buying Interest Remain Subdued</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, prices for all months showed a trend of initial stability followed by loosening and falling. With the price of foreign wheat, Chicago rebounded by 30-40 cents, and Canada rose by 50-60 cents. Therefore, at the opening, near-term months such as September and October were seen as stable, similar to the previous day. The opening price for November reflected a softening of sentiment due to the cessation of wind and rain. Despite the positive performance of foreign wheat, buying interest was subdued. As a result, trading was sluggish in the afternoon session, and the market was very quiet. It is reported that various factories currently have stockpiles of flour, and sales have not been strong. Furthermore, inland factories are also actively promoting sales. Under these circumstances, future developments may lead to a natural price decline due to oversupply.</p>
<h3>Most Spot Goods Are Sold as Hedges, Wheat Futures Trend Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, prices for all months were generally volatile and slightly soft at the opening in the morning. Although the price of foreign wheat rebounded by 30-60 cents, arrivals from various sources have been quite slow recently. Factories, on the other hand, are not eager to buy due to sluggish flour sales. Therefore, customers holding spot goods mostly sold them as hedges. As a result, the market initially opened firm but later weakened. Trading was sluggish in the afternoon session, and prices trended downward. Looking ahead, there is concern about a potential price decline. In the spot wheat market, high-quality goods remained stable, while medium-quality goods fell slightly by 25 cents. Kaiyingzhou wheat was priced at 4.95 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 4.94 yuan, Jue at 4.92-4.93 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 4.83 yuan, Jue at 4.78 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.75 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 4.93 yuan, Hefei wheat at 4.79 yuan, Hushu wheat at 4.78 yuan, Suqian wheat at 4.77-4.78 yuan, Huai'an wheat at 4.82 yuan, second grade at 4.78 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 4.88 yuan, second grade at 4.85 yuan, Caishi wheat at 4.72 yuan, Jue at 4.67 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 4.77 yuan, second grade at 4.75-4.76 yuan, and Hankou cart wheat at 4.75 yuan, Jue at 4.72 yuan. The Fufeng mill handled 4,000 bags, the Fuxin mill handled 5,000 bags, and the Shenda mill handled 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Thick and Thin Japonica Rice: High-Quality Goods Remain Stable</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, sources from various groups totaled thirteen or fourteen batches, but both retail and wholesale sales were slow. In addition, the weather is turning normal, and people's sentiment is weak, resulting in a market situation of stability with a hint of fatigue. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice, except for high-quality goods that can barely be maintained, have been repeatedly reduced for lower-quality goods, but sales remain sluggish. Du Yangjian and Yinbianyuan are all average. A total of seven or eight hundred dan of Cambodian new rice arrived, with prices holding at previous levels. New tip rice prices are unchanged.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, sources from various river ports totaled sixteen or seventeen batches. Demand for all goods in the market was weak. New Yangjian japonica rice was turning soft. New Tuanjian rice, which was cheaper, saw some transactions, while other goods were average. Market prices for white japonica new Tuanjian and thin paddy rice were down by a few cents to nearly a dollar. New Kejian rice was average and tired. There was little change in the prices of Yangdu Bujian and new Yangjian Dongxin japonica rice.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Purchases Significant Quantities of Ke Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of Ke Xian rice remained strong, and local Ke rice sales were even more active. The market remained in a stable position. Newly arrived goods were mainly from Shahan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, and sales of rough rice to Guangdong merchants were the most active. Guangdong merchants have been very eager to purchase in recent days. For rough rice alone, approximately 150,000 bags have already been shipped out. Shantou also became active yesterday, and statistics from local inland areas showed that over 10,000 bags were shipped out. Because the origin of Ke Xian rice is shipping out vigorously, and the existing stock in Shanghai is quite sufficient, the owners are all eager to sell off, and the market is not easy to be good. Yesterday, 1,685 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,500 bags of Hunan rice, 3,500 bags of Shahan rice, 145 bags of Taiwanese Xian rice, and 300 bags of Jing Sui rice were shipped out.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Sesame Supply and Demand Are Balanced; New Soybeans Are Also Turning Stable</h3>
<p>Foreign firms' new sesame seeds are being offered for sale, and selling sentiment remains quite strong. However, Darfu Foreign Firm's purchasing appetite is also quite strong. It is reported that the firm had already sold at $12.70-80 yuan per ton to overseas companies, so they are currently continuing to import to cover, and is in no way making any gains from it. Yesterday, another 800 tons were purchased at a price of 12.15 yuan, a slight decrease of five cents compared to the previous market. However, under the current trend, the supply and demand between buyers and sellers are balanced, and the market situation may be brought back to normalcy. The new soybean market situation has temporarily entered a stable path. Oil factories, Nanyang, and local companies are all inquiring. Yesterday, a total of over 5,000 bags of new soybeans from various sources were traded.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Users Seem to Be Satisfied - Total Daily Transactions 126 Bundles -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market continued its downward trend. Silk trading on the New York Stock Exchange was very quiet. According to Reuters, the total trading volume was only 320 bales, and the opening prices for near- and far-term contracts were each down one cent from the previous day. Yokohama and Lyon were both holding steady at their original prices. Silk exports from Shanghai are currently difficult to be strong. Yesterday, French firm White Factory's B grade was still asking for 600 yuan, but no transactions were seen. American firm 78 out of 80 evenness was asking for 620 yuan, which was down 5-10 yuan from the previous day. Therefore, second-grade B grade is trending towards breaking 600 yuan. On the user side, market prices are also decreasing daily. For example, Black Flying Horse brand was sold for 610 yuan yesterday, which was down 17.50 yuan from the previous two days. Furthermore, observing users' buying appetite, they also seem to be quite satisfied. Therefore, yesterday's transactions were slightly lower. Total domestic and foreign silk sales were 126 bundles, with foreign firms accounting for 67 bundles.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Sales to England Continue Actively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market, transactions of Qimen black tea continued to be strong. English firms such as Xiehe Jinlong and others remained keenly interested in purchasing. Over 700 boxes were traded throughout the city, with selling prices ranging from 40 to 48 yuan. It is reported that Jardine Matheson and the Soviet Union Tea Department also have telegrams inquiring about sales. As for the green tea market, there was still no major progress. Only needle-shaped and pearl teas had slight sporadic sales. Wholesale sales of Zhen Mei green tea remained sparse.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, the green tea market was quiet before, as various firms prepared to load ships. Yesterday, it became active again, especially with more transactions of Suian Zhen Mei. Baolong purchased 200 boxes, Xiehe purchased over 400 boxes, and Jinlong purchased over 100 boxes, at prices ranging from 50 to 52 yuan. Tunwu Zhen Mei, Baolong, and Fushi each purchased over 200 boxes, at prices ranging from 60 to 70 yuan.

For Ping Shui tea, the Dabang Jinjiang is still taking some lower to mid tier, and although there are talks about other pearl teas, there are no known transactions.</p>

<p>Self-Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>One Proof That Prolonged Illness Creates a Good Doctor</h3>
<p>Acute gonorrhea is very painful; chronic gonorrhea has deep viral roots.</p>
<p>(A letter from Mr. Hu of Renlin Lane, Lagena Road, French Concession, Shanghai): Editor, Sir, I have always been mindful of the principles of health preservation, and have always maintained a clean life. However, in the winter of 1931, due to business entertainment, I and several colleagues attended a banquet and celebration. Due to excessive drinking, I was confused for a moment, and after drinking, I indulged in pleasure, accompanying my colleagues on a visit to the red-light district. To me, it was the very first time in my life. Unexpectedly, Heaven did not protect me, and the prostitute was unclean. One slip led to infection with gonorrhea, and the symptoms of gonorrhea and leukorrhea appeared together, causing unspeakable suffering. Concerned about my reputation, I had to seek medical treatment and medication in secret, without consulting friends. At that time, I was at a loss, and took various medicines indiscriminately, which resulted in the toxins being drawn inward, turning into a chronic condition, with dangerous complications and multiple harms. Sometimes my testicles would swell, sometimes I would suffer from cystitis pain, and my urine would be scalding and red, causing indescribable suffering. Sometimes it would get slightly better, sometimes it would flare up, lingering until now. The expenditure of time, energy, and money is beyond description. I thought that this chronic disease would be with me forever, and I would not be able to save myself. This spring, my fortunes finally turned for the better. Fortunately, I was directed by Dr. Wu Dachao's medical publication in the News to purchase half a dozen "Anti-Gonorrhea" compound preparations of yellow pigment and vaccine from Wing On Company and Sino-British Dispensary one after another, and to receive electrotherapy and lavage from Dr. Zhan Nianceng. The medicine was exceptionally effective, and the surgery was painless. Before half a dozen doses were finished, my urine was clear and the leukorrhea was gone, and the inflammation and pain were gone. Because I also took "Reproduction Elements" at the same time to restore my vitality, I quickly recovered my health. After recovery, a urine test showed no traces of gonorrhea. Even after heavy labor, it does not recur. Now I am strong and healthy, far better than five years ago. However, I cannot help but speak of the past suffering of secretly groping in the dark and the huge amount of loss. I think there are many people in the world who suffer from the same disease and are in the same situation. Since I have been able to extricate myself, I sincerely hope that those who come after me will also escape the sea of suffering. Therefore, the writing of this letter is the duty of those who have already reached the other shore. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>
<p>— Dr. Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<h3>Healthy Sex Life (Based On) Healthy Gonads</h3>
<p>Attention to Couples with Indifferent Feelings!</p>
<p>One of the important purposes of a marital partnership is to be able to exercise and satisfy the physiological need for a healthy sex life. Only in this way can feelings be harmonious, can fertility be expected, can happiness be abundant, and can mutual assistance be achieved. Otherwise, if there are many defects in sex life, then feelings will be indifferent, fertility will be hopeless, happiness will be shallow, and mutual assistance will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the health of sex life is something that married people should pay attention to, and unmarried and soon-to-be-married people should not take it lightly!</p>
<p>But how can a healthy sex life be obtained? It depends on whether the gonads are healthy. The gonads have a great relationship with health and longevity, and they have a direct relationship with reproductive function and the exercise of sex life. Those with weakened gonads will inevitably suffer from various sexual and hidden diseases. In men, nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, impotence, and other symptoms will occur frequently. In women, leucorrhea, menstrual disorders, breast atrophy, miscarriage, and other diseases will arise. Sexual function will be destroyed, so how can one expect to enjoy a healthy sex life? Therefore, those whose gonads have declined, resulting in a hundred diseases, must be treated urgently. The gonad hormone preparation "Reproduction Elements" should be the only essential medicine, which is self-evident. For example:</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tian and his wife have been married for no less than eight years, but because the husband is weak and the wife is sick, they have not been able to dream of the happiness of a healthy sex life, resulting in physical weakness and hopelessness of having children. Examining the root cause, it is because Mr. Tian suffers from premature ejaculation and impotence, and often experiences nocturnal emissions, insomnia, night sweats, tremors, and other symptoms. All medicines were ineffective, and his body was declining day by day. Mrs. Tian often felt soreness and pain during her period, and leucorrhea was also continuous. They delayed treatment and became trapped until now, resulting in withered breasts and thin buttocks, without any healthy or beautiful state. Last autumn, through the introduction of his close relative Mr. Cai (who had previously been cured of the same disease at my clinic), they came for treatment. I instructed Mr. Tian to take "Hymeto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" internally to strengthen sperm and treat nocturnal emissions, and to use "Reproduction Elements" to nourish sperm, strengthen the body, and restore his sexual function. Mrs. Tian was instructed to take "Female Reproduction Elements" internally to regulate menstruation and strengthen muscles, and to use "Leukorrhea Cure" externally to cleanse and eliminate leucorrhea. The couple simultaneously treated themselves according to the method. In just one month, all symptoms were eliminated. The gonads were fully healthy, and the couple's feelings were even better than during their honeymoon. Recently, Mr. Cai told me that Mrs. Tian is already several months pregnant.</p>
<h3>Eliminate Toxins, Break Addiction, Reverse Decline, and Treat Disease</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Patients Mr. Ma and his wife had been addicted for a long time, and were heavily addicted. They sought to quit many times, but each time, decline and illness emerged, causing great suffering, making it difficult to achieve full effectiveness. Recently, due to the urgent prohibition order, they visited my clinic and sought safe smoking cessation. I immediately instructed them to purchase and take the famous male and female "Reproduction Elements" strengthening and smoking cessation preparations from Taihe Pharmacy to eliminate toxins and break addiction. Because the efficacy of "Reproduction Elements" in reversing decline and treating disease is great and reliable, their conditions were cured in less than a month, and they regained their strength and health. Toxins were eliminated, addiction was broken, and smoking was safely stopped. Mr. Ma also injected "Nutrivit Life-Saving" to assist him, so he not only shortened his smoking cessation period, but also quickly restored his health.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission, Insomnia, Safe Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tu, 47 years old, initially needed to work late nights due to his occupation, and his spirit was insufficient, resulting in smoking addiction and a decline in his health. He had been heavily addicted for the last two years and had sometimes displayed nocturnal emissions, and suffered more with insomnia. He tried to quit multiple times, but stopped due to restlessness. Last month, he visited my clinic and was instructed to purchase and take "Hymeto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emissions, and "Reproduction Elements" to treat his insomnia, weakness, and other symptoms. His spirit suddenly felt restored. Because "Reproduction Elements" also has the function of eliminating toxins and breaking addiction, he safely broke his addiction after taking half a dozen doses, and quickly recovered his strength and health.</p>
<h3>Regulate Menstruation, Treat Leukorrhea, Develop Breasts</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>If a woman's body loses its health, breast atrophy is often the first sign. By the time menstrual irregularities and persistent leucorrhea occur, the body's decline is in a deep abyss. Beauty is lost, health is lost, vitality is extinguished, and the hope of offspring is lost. Therefore, those who are sick should be treated for their sickness, and those with atrophic breasts should quickly seek to restore their health and beauty, which is also an urgent plan to restore their health.</p>
<p>For example, this spring there were Mrs. Xue and Ms. Liu. Ms. Liu was dissatisfied with her atrophic breasts, which had no health or beauty. After taking "Female Reproduction Elements," she became strong and healthy, her breasts became plump, and she was immune to a hundred diseases. Mrs. Xue had early signs of breast atrophy, but she was unaware and did not seek treatment, resulting in menstrual irregularities and unspeakable suffering. Later, because of continuous leucorrhea, she asked Mr. Xue to accompany her to seek treatment. I instructed her to purchase and take "Female Reproduction Elements" from the Sino-British Dispensary to regulate her menstruation and strengthen her body, and to use "Leukorrhea Cure" externally to eliminate inflammation and cleanse her genitals. Soon, her symptoms were eliminated, her muscles became strong, and her breasts and buttocks both rose high, fully expressing the curvaceous beauty that a young woman should have, which was greatly praised by her relatives and friends.</p>
<h3>Bone Pain Is Not a Mild Condition, But It Is Also Not a Chronic Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Our clinical statistics show that there are many patients with bone and joint pain, and many of them have been untreated for many years. Examining the reasons for this, patients with bone and joint pain have two major misunderstandings: first, patients often think that this disease is a mild condition that is not worth paying attention to; second, because patients often receive improper treatment, which is difficult to cure for a long time, they regard this disease as an incurable chronic disease. Therefore, patients sit back and suffer from the disease without paying attention to it, and stop seeking treatment after failing to receive proper treatment. Is this not very wrong? Bone and joint pain is not a mild condition. It can not only cause numbness in the limbs, loss of flexibility, muscle soreness, loss of health, muscle cramps, loss of comfort, and paralysis, loss of freedom, but also cause patients to have abnormal excretion, excessive uric acid, and hardening of the arteries, which can easily lead to rupture, stroke, sudden collapse, and other disasters!</p>
<p>The causes of this disease are diverse, not only internal dampness caused by wind and rheumatism, but also residual toxins that have not been cleared. Therefore, the treatment method should take both sides into account. However, patients often only treat one aspect, resulting in the inability to cure the root cause. The so-called incurable pain disease is all caused by not understanding the cause and treatment knowledge of this disease. I will record two examples for patients to learn from, which is not only to instill the knowledge of this disease!?</p>
<p>Combined Bone Pain Must Be Treated in Combination</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lu suffered from severe symptoms of neurasthenia. He tried various drugs, but none showed any improvement. His back was sore, and he was apparently worn out. His body trembled and his limbs were cold, and he was extremely exhausted. This spring, he came to my clinic. I diagnosed that Mr. Lu not only lacked reproductive elements, and his nerves were extremely weakened, but he also had internal dampness caused by wind and rheumatism, and residual toxins that had not been cleared, and also suffered from bone pain. If he only treated one aspect, it would not be effective. I instructed him to purchase and take "Reproduction Elements" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to supplement his gonads and reverse his decline, and to use "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets" to dispel his wind and rheumatism and eliminate his residual toxins. After taking about half a dozen doses, he immediately felt lighter in his back, and his joints also felt more comfortable. Years of chronic illness was suddenly removed completely.</p>
<p>Long-Term Untreated, Rapidly Cured</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lv, 48 years old, from Anhui Province, suffered from bone pain for nearly 20 years. Repeatedly taking ordinary medicines had no effect in curing the root cause, resulting in occasional pain, and even more pain during seasonal changes. He had delayed until now, and his hands and feet had become numb, and his body was paralyzed. In recent years, he had also suffered from nocturnal emissions. This spring, he came for treatment. I instructed him to purchase and take "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets" from Wing On Company to cure the root cause of his bone pain, limb numbness, and body paralysis, and to use "Hymeto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emissions, and to take "Reproduction Elements" to supplement his essence and blood and restore his strength and health. In just about three weeks, his new and old illnesses were all quickly cured.</p>

<h3>Differentiation of Spermatorrhea (and) Leukorrhea (and) Their Secret Effective Self-Treatment Method</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and leukorrhea are two completely different diseases. Many people understand their pathology, but many young people do not. Because there have been several inquiries in the form of letters every day recently, I am writing this article to provide a general response.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is one of the symptoms of sexual neurasthenia, which is often transformed from nocturnal emissions and premature ejaculation. Patients have loose seminal vesicles and neurasthenia, so the treatment method is to take "Hymeto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate the seminal vesicles, and to use "Reproduction Elements" to reverse their sexual nerves. As for leukorrhea, the source of the disease is caused by gonorrhea, so the treatment method focuses on killing bacteria and purifying the discharge. The most effective medicine is to take "Anti-Gonorrhea" internally. If sexual function has been destroyed, then "Reproduction Elements" is also an essential medicine for restoring sexual function. Leukorrhea mainly focuses on purification, while spermatorrhea mainly focuses on consolidation. This is the clearest distinction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, spermatorrhea is the spontaneous leakage of semen caused by the stimulation of the nervous center, while leukorrhea is a purulent secretion. Leukorrhea is a contagious venereal disease, transmitted by unclean sexual intercourse. Spermatorrhea is caused by masturbation, early marriage, sexual overexertion, weakness, and other causes. With the differentiation method and medication method clearly defined, patients should know the way to self-treatment.</p>
<p>Famous Medicine Experiment</p>
<p>When purchasing medicine, be sure to firmly specify the purchase and do not be persuaded to change to other medicines to avoid delaying the disease.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Xu, 21 years old, currently residing on Tangshan Road, suffered from frequent nocturnal emissions, insomnia, and forgetfulness last month. After taking "Hymeto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate sperm and treat nocturnal emissions, and taking "Reproduction Elements" to nourish sperm and strengthen the brain, his symptoms were suddenly cured, no different from rebirth.</p>
<p>Impotence and Sexual Weakness</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Sun, 34 years old, from the working class, Mr. Sun was injured by early marriage and sexual overexertion, resulting in impotence and sexual weakness, making it difficult to perform his husbandly duties and preventing him from having children. After purchasing and taking "Reproduction Elements" from Wing On Company, for just under half a dozen doses, the local area developed beyond that of ordinary people, and sexual function was also healthier than before, as if reborn.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Du, 42 years old, working in a foreign firm, Mr. Du was weak and overworked, resulting in extreme neurasthenia. After receiving electrotherapy from Physician Zhan Nianceng and taking "Reproduction Elements," his nerves were restored to prosperity, his body became strong, and his spirit was invigorated. Even when facing heavy labor, he was not tired.</p>
<p>Stomach Pain and Smoking Cessation</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou, a local, 49 years old, became addicted to smoking in his youth because stomach pain was difficult to relieve. He repeatedly sought treatment to quit, but none succeeded. This summer, his colleague Mr. Wu informed him of his experience, and he took "Stomach Pain Relief" to cure his stomach pain at the root, and used "Stomach-Strengthening Elements" to regulate it, and took "Reproduction Elements" to cultivate and smoking cessation. In just three weeks, he achieved the miraculous effect of safe smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease Lecture</p>
<p>— Jointly compiled by Dr. Yao Erchang and Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) Second floor of China Trust Company at the corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(Venereal Disease Principles) Nocturnal emission is caused by loose seminal vesicles that cannot be restrained, mostly caused by the loss of masturbation. Therefore, the treatment method should focus on consolidating sperm and nourishing sperm - premature ejaculation and impotence are generally caused by early marriage and excessive sexual exertion. Therefore, the treatment method is mainly to cultivate the gonads and restore their sexual function - the source of turbid disease lies in the mischief of gonorrhea, so the treatment method focuses on killing bacteria - leucorrhea is divided into gonorrheal and non-gonorrheal. The treatment method for gonorrheal leucorrhea is the same as that for leukorrhea, with "Anti-Gonorrhea" dominating. Non-gonorrheal leucorrhea can be treated with "Female Reproduction Elements" internally to strengthen the uterus and strengthen the body, and "Leukorrhea Cure" externally to cleanse and eliminate inflammation - With the principles clarified, and referring to the examples of medication, the treatment method will be clear.</p>
<p>Frequent Nocturnal Emissions – One Example of Salvation</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Shi, 24 years old, committed masturbation when young, which was too intense, resulting in loose seminal vesicles, leading to nocturnal emissions, wet dreams, and other symptoms. This spring, because the frequency increased and his physical strength could not support it, he came for treatment. In addition to performing electrotherapy and circumcision, he was instructed to purchase and take "Hymeto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from the Sino-British Dispensary to treat his nocturnal emissions, and to use "Reproduction Elements" to nourish sperm, strengthen the body, and restore his health within one month.</p>
<p>Premature Ejaculation and Impotence – No Hope of Fertility</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Li, from Zhejiang Province, 37 years old, married too early, and his sexual life was not regulated, causing great damage to his sexual function. He initially felt premature ejaculation and finally became impotent, losing his vitality and making it difficult to perform his husbandly duties. He had been married for years and had not had any children. Last winter, Shao, a relative from his hometown, introduced him to the clinic for treatment. Electrotherapy was administered, and he was instructed to purchase and take "Reproduction Elements" from Wing On Company. After taking more than five boxes, his sexual function was greatly restored. Recently, his neighbor Mr. Tang was introduced to the clinic to treat the same venereal disease. During the conversation, it was learned that Mr. Li's wife had been pregnant for many months.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is Continuous – The Pain is Unspeakable</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Ji, a local, 29 years old, had an unclean relationship two years ago, resulting in gonorrhea. Repeated treatments were ineffective, turning it into a chronic condition, with inflammation complications and dangerous conditions. The lingering and continuous illness was causing unspeakable pain. This spring, Mr. Tan, who lives with him, introduced him to the clinic. In addition to performing electrotherapy and washing operations, he was instructed to purchase and take the famous medicine for gonorrhea and pain, "Anti-Gonorrhea," from the Sino-Western Pharmacy. After taking it for one month, the inflammation was gone, the turbidity was cleared, and the urine was clear, with no traces of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Breast Atrophy – Restore Health and Beauty</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Lu, around 30 years old, has had persistent leucorrhea for nearly seven years, which has been concealed and untreated, resulting in a weak body and breast atrophy, losing her health and beauty. In early summer, because Mr. Lu was cured of his venereal disease, she came to the clinic for treatment with him. She was instructed to take "Female Reproduction Elements" internally and "Leukorrhea Cure" externally. In less than one month, the leucorrhea was cleared, and her breasts also regained healthy and beautiful development.</p>

<h3>New and Old Perspectives on Chinese Women</h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>Chinese women have been oppressed by men since ancient times, and this has become a common practice. Since the May Fourth Movement, although some educated women have been striving for liberation, importing new ideas and trends from Europe and the West, very few truly understand and appreciate them. As for old-fashioned women, they naturally do not understand what learning and thought are, blindly clinging to the so-called three obediences and four virtues, which is indeed a great pity. But they each have their strengths and weaknesses, with their own advantages and disadvantages!</p>
<p>Regarding knowledge, new women undoubtedly have the upper hand. Having received education—whether general or higher education—they at least understand some common sense about family and society and will not believe in superstitions and unscientific ideas. Furthermore, they excel in fine arts, crafts, and social skills. Therefore, they also feel a strong interest in life. Old-fashioned women are different: because they have not attended school, their knowledge and experience are limited, so they are unaccustomed to new sounds (like music) and sights (like art). They do not know how big the Earth is; a county town or a city is their world. This is indeed the biggest shortcoming of old-fashioned women, and the main reason why they cannot keep pace with women around the world.</p>
<p>Regarding household management, on the surface, it seems that new-style women are more knowledgeable, but in practice, old-fashioned women are more capable of managing things with ease. This is not surprising because educated women are required to pursue academic progress on the one hand, and take care of household chores on the other, so they naturally become neglectful and lack focus. Moreover, having come from schools, they have very little practical experience once they become housewives. Old-fashioned women are trained from childhood and are more able to endure hardship. They regard household management as their inherent duty and do not feel disgusted. Apart from this, they have no other thoughts in their minds.</p>
<p>Divorce is a very serious issue in modern society. The reason is mostly due to the influence of a bad environment. The reason why old-fashioned women do not have this problem is partly because they lack the ability and intellectual tools, and partly because their desires are easily satisfied, as long as their husbands can provide them with food and clothing, they consider themselves happy, unlike new women who are good at being demanding. Such blind obedience allows men to abuse them at will, and new women, being oppressed under strong authority, are certainly unwilling to submit. However, it is also not commendable for new women to be arrogant and frivolous, to look down on others, and to declare divorce with a little superficial knowledge.</p>
<p>Comparing the above items, we can see the general situation of modern new and old women. It is hoped that they will develop their strengths and overcome their weaknesses, which would be the blessing of the women's world!</p>
<h3>Chinese Women in a Time of Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Chinese women, whose new foundations are not yet fully stable and whose old structures have been largely destroyed, can be said to be in the most dangerous position in this time of turmoil. This is the criticism of Chinese women published by Mrs. Hua Lei Si, who lived in China for seventeen years and recently returned to England, in the British magazine Red Star. The title of this article is "Chinese Women in a Time of Turmoil."</p>
<p>She said that although Chinese women have had more than ten years of history since liberation, it is naturally not enough to completely transform the solid position of women for three thousand years in just over ten years. Therefore, Chinese women are currently only just raising the curtain on the new women's movement. But unfortunately, Chinese women have encountered a major setback in this first act. — This setback can also be said to be that Chinese women themselves have gone astray. Because the slogans of the liberation movement for Chinese women are "social openness," "freedom of occupation," and "equal opportunities," but the effect of these slogans has completely turned into a tool for marriage. When love matures, "social interaction," "occupation," "opportunity,"... are all automatically abandoned. Although this phenomenon is undoubtedly due to the marriage system and the patriarchal society of China for three thousand years being too firmly rooted, and the general public regards the issue of marriage as the most important thing above all else, and this kind of legacy is still traditionally inherited, the naivety of the Chinese education on "men and women issues" cannot be blamed. Because the Chinese concept of chastity still preserves the畸形 habits of three thousand years, and has not been improved at all due to the emerging women's movement. This is the most dangerous and sad position in which Chinese women find themselves in this time of turmoil.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hua Lei Si quoted a story witnessed in China. She said that a Chinese lady worked very hard for the liberation movement of Chinese women. She had received a considerable education, and she had also worked in a certain commercial institution. In 1927, she married a university student because of love. After marriage, she immediately resigned from her job because her husband was enough to maintain her life. At the same time, she also disappeared from social circles because she was afraid that her husband would suspect her of having romantic actions. After a year, she was abandoned by her husband because he discovered a secret of hers before marriage. Although she received alimony in 1929 and formally divorced, her reputation and status were greatly damaged. Her parents, brothers, and even her closest sister broke off contact with her. At the same time, she also felt that she was a woman with extremely deep sins, and everything seemed to be over. Sadness and depression pressed on her entire soul. In 1931, her divorced husband married another woman, but she went crazy in 1932. She lived in the hospital for two years and finally died in 1934. When she first divorced, Mrs. Hua Lei Si tried her best to guide and comfort her, but she insisted on the theory of status and environment, and did not have the courage to fight for status and environment, and finally sacrificed everything.</p>
<p>What Mrs. Hua Lei Si said is only a corner of the women's liberation movement. In reality, the traps on the road to liberation are densely arranged. — I feel that in this turbulent period, if Chinese women cannot have sufficient cultivation and understanding in the two aspects of education and thought, and rashly engage in it, compared with standing on an unstable new foundation, the danger is even greater!</p>
<h3>In Times of Emergency</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>- Female Police Needed -</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has recruited many female police officers, which some people may find strange. In fact, it is a very ordinary thing in foreign countries, but in China, it is the first time ever. We have always had a saying: "Good people don't become soldiers, good iron isn't used to make nails." But looking at the number of applicants this time, there are as many as two hundred people, most of whom are high school graduates, junior college graduates, and junior high school graduates, followed by elementary school graduates. Such enthusiasm is really beyond the expectations of ordinary people. Isn't it breaking our deeply rooted bad ideas?</p>
<p>We must know that China is in danger of being invaded by powerful neighbors day and night. No matter where or when, we are in a state of emergency. Everyone should arm themselves to defend the country. If something happens to the country in the future, who do you want to maintain social order? Then, we will naturally need our trained female police officers to take responsibility for maintaining local order. Since China is now in a state of emergency, preparations for self-rescue must be carried out actively. Hey! Look: During the European War, almost all the able-bodied men in Germany went to war. Social security relied on many female police officers to be responsible for maintaining order just like usual. In this way, are female police officers not needed?</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all provinces and cities across the country have the need to recruit female police officers. If something happens to the four families, there will be many female police officers who will be responsible for social security. The military and police on the front line will no longer have to worry about social security in the rear, so they can not be divided into combat strength. China's need for female police officers goes without saying. I hope the authorities will work hard to promote it, and women will enthusiastically apply for the responsibility of being female police officers in times of emergency.</p>
<h3>Respectfully Addressed to My Fellow Women</h3>
<p>— (Xi Yu Lin)</p>
<p>- Can Be Used as a Motto -</p>
<p>Don't think that you are a woman and cannot share the same rights and obligations as men.</p>
<p>Strive for simplicity in clothing and do not dress up enchantingly to please men.</p>
<p>Do not think that you are beautiful and despise men or insult your own sex.</p>
<p>A wife should share her husband's burdens when he encounters difficulties.</p>
<p>Morbid beauty is not beauty; healthy beauty is beauty.</p>
<p>Do not apply heavy makeup to your face; apply light makeup so as not to lose your original appearance.</p>
<p>Use domestic goods for clothing, but do not be extravagant.</p>
<p>Mothers should not often scold their children, but should use the method of "patient guidance."</p>
<p>All groups studying women's issues should be freely joined.</p>
<p>Between lipsticks that seem right but are not, and bullets, which will you use to repay those who have been as passionate as the sun to you?</p>
<h3>Women in Spain</h3>
<p>— Ying Tian</p>
<p>Because the Spanish royalists and right-wing republicans joined forces to fight against the left-wing government, Spain fell into a state of unrest. Recently, several fierce battles have taken place, which aroused my interest in the new women in Spain who are in the process of liberation.</p>
<p>From the monarchy to the republic, Spanish women have been liberated at an extremely rapid pace. Although they still like to wear red flowers in their hair to symbolize their feminine allure, in reality, they are constantly seeking equal, or even superior, competition with men in various activities. This is because the constitution of the newly established republic stipulates that they have equal opportunities with men to obtain services for the country and society. In a certain session of Congress, there were already three women. From this point of view, if there is a national election in Spain, I wonder how many women will be elected as representatives to appear before us, because the above three members were only selected by a part of the men in Congress.</p>
<p>I remember a woman named Margarita Salaverria, who was the first woman in the Spanish women's world to obtain a diplomatic position through examination. This thunderbolt, which broke the history of Spain, shocked men all over the country and won the joy and sympathy of women all over the country.</p>
<p>The first person to break into the all-male historical research association was Mercedes Cabrois Ballesteros, a historian in Spain.</p>
<p>The above three items are the glorious beginnings of women in politics, literature... The sports of Spanish women are very prosperous. In Madrid, Xue Mi Er, Ba Lingxi Ya, Ba Xuelang Na and other cities, we can easily find the information of their liberation. An ordinary married or unmarried woman can see them stretching out their healthy arms and vigorously hitting tennis, hockey, etc. It has also been suggested that they compete openly with Spanish bullfighters. From this, we can see a glimpse of Spanish women.</p>
<p>Every lady is almost a master of sports.</p>
<p>Singing popular love songs composed by Americans, directing orchestras to play music in tea houses, everything has the same rights as men. It is worth praising, and it is glorious, the new women in Spain are in the process of liberation!</p>
<p>However, how will this coup in Spain lead them to progress in their fate? I praise the efforts of Spanish women.</p>
<h3>World Women's News</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>The Thrift Movement in Hollywood</p>
<p>American women's enjoyment and luxury seem to be world-famous, and even more so the movie stars, who seem to have a unique habit of spending money like water. But that is not the case. American women's enjoyment and luxury are actually limited to occupational relations. The general women's love of thrift is similar to that of women in other countries. Even Hollywood, the center of luxury, is now brewing a very strong atmosphere of thrift. Last month, a sign of "Hollywood Film Female Employee Thrift Alliance" was hung at the gate of Mrs. Mao Li Si's apartment five miles from Hollywood. The office is located on the third floor of the building, occupying three offices and a conference room that can accommodate one hundred and fifty people. The credo of the alliance is not to make unnecessary social engagements or enjoyments except for business relations. About three hundred people have joined, all of whom are well-known female stars in Hollywood. The chairman is Mei Hui Si De. The alliance also plans to open a consumer cooperative department and a savings and investment department within six months.</p>
<p>Soviet Women's Aviation Fever</p>
<p>Aviation is now developing rapidly in the Soviet Union. Women are more interested in aviation than men. According to a survey, in Moscow alone, including the suburbs, there are between three and four thousand women who can fly airplanes. Professional female pilots account for only 6% to 8%, and the rest are amateur pilots. Most of these female pilots work in light and heavy industry. Doctors and nurses also occupy a considerable position. There are the fewest farmers. In terms of age, those between 25 and 30 years old rank first in general. The youngest are twin sisters who are only sixty-seven years old. The oldest is Mrs. Tuo Li Mo Qu, the principal of Litovfsky Primary School in Moscow, who is fifty-eight years old. The female doctor, Mrs. Lu Er, who is thirty-two years old, has the best flight record. In March of this year, she flew alone on a stormy night to a town in the Yaxu Wu Sea to pick up a patient and flew back to Moscow before dawn. She received an honorary certificate from the government.</p>
<p>Western European Women Protect Animals</p>
<p>The movement to protect animals was originally created in England. With the support of Queen Victoria, it has achieved remarkable results. However, although there is also this movement in continental Europe, its results are far from comparable. Recently, several women of status in Belgium and the Netherlands have repeatedly gathered in Antwerp, Belgium, to discuss reorganizing and expanding the existing animal protection associations. They have also raised a large amount of funds from the royal families of the two countries and are now preparing to carry out a large-scale propaganda campaign, and will request the legislative bodies of the two countries to legislate to protect animals, so that those who abuse animals and those who abuse young children will receive the same punishment. The movement is now gradually developing eastward. In the near future, women in France, Switzerland and other countries will also have a strong animal protection movement to benefit animals and promote the inherent maternal love of women.</p>
<p>London Women's Book Club</p>
<p>The East End of London established a new "Housewives' Book Club" this spring. The purpose of the club is that general housewives are burdened by housework every day, and some do not read a book all year round. This is not enough for their own intellectual nourishment, and there is a risk of regressing or falling behind day by day. At the same time, it is natural that it cannot but give a considerable response to the education of children. Therefore, this housewives' book club came into being. To join this housewives' book club, the annual membership fee is five pounds. The club lends a famous book every ten days or half a month, and limits how many days to finish reading it. (Generally, the standard is to study for one and a half to two hours every day.) After reading, they must also make a report, stating their thoughts after reading. This is tantamount to a kind of forced reading method, so that the housewives who join the club cannot but take time to read every day, and the method is very good. It is heard that there are now about two thousand people who have joined. Among them, there are two hundred members who live far away in South Africa, North America, Shanghai, Australia, and various parts of Europe.</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Medical Doctor Liu Jianqiu Discusses Family Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Where does the starting point of a happy new family lie? Some people say: Having money satisfies everything, and some people say: Having excellent children makes a family happy. This statement has considerable truth, but money is not necessarily the happiness of a family. Sometimes money is the root of evil, causing dark and terrifying events. It can be seen that surplus money is unreliable. I believe that a healthy life is the starting point of happiness and well-being. In any family, if men, women, old and young, injure or fall ill, spending their days with medicine, this is the most painful thing. On the contrary, if everyone in the family is strong and healthy, those who work hard, those who study diligently, and work together to develop their careers, I feel that this family is the happiest. Speaking of this problem, it can be said to be the most difficult to handle. Regardless of parents and children, everyone must pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene. Everyone can say this, but how to do it? I am afraid that it cannot be done without the guidance of a doctor. The other day, I discussed these issues with a female doctor - Dr. Liu Jianqiu. She is from Pixian County, Jiangsu Province, and a graduate of the first class of Jinling Women's University. She studied in the United States for six years and obtained a medical doctorate from the University of Michigan. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, she returned to China and served as the director of obstetrics and gynecology at the Ximen Women's and Children's Hospital in Shanghai, Dinghai Hospital, and Hangzhou Municipal Hospital. Since the eighteenth year, she has served as the medical director of Renhe Hospital and the dean of the Senior Midwifery School. With more than ten years of experience, her contributions to medicine are naturally great. Here, her words are recorded for the reference of general housewives.</p>
<p>The first point is the perception of medicine: Although I am a doctor myself, I do not want to talk about the medical career, because Chinese people are too superstitious and lack medical knowledge, and do not have a thorough understanding and recognition of new medicine. When a person gets sick and asks a doctor, they often do not listen to the doctor's instructions. When something goes wrong, they complain that the doctor is not responsible enough. This is such an injustice! On the doctor's side, few can study the patient's psychology. The lack of mutual consideration is also a cause of failure. New medicine is still in its infancy in China. Except for cities, rural areas have not yet received the benefits of new medicine. There are probably several reasons: (1) There are too few new doctors, not enough to distribute; (2) The life in the interior is extremely difficult and transportation is difficult. Even if there are doctors, patients cannot afford to seek medical treatment from afar; (3) Farmers do not accumulate wealth easily and naturally value money very much. They do not know the price of Western medicine. For example, if a medicine is worth five yuan, they want it for three yuan, and they cannot wait for the medical expenses to be completely free. But how can this be done in reality? Therefore, I believe that Chinese society must use the power of politics to promote public health in rural areas, reward scientific new medicine, and change people's psychology. Then the future of new medicine will be promising.</p>
<p>The second point is women's hygiene: The two words hygiene are not easy to talk about. Only with money can we talk about hygiene. You think of the four basic needs of life, clothing, food, shelter and transportation, all of which require sufficient economy to be considered? Now most people's lives are not easy to maintain, so where can we talk about hygiene? This is the case in cities, and it goes without saying in rural areas. Hygiene should be paid attention to by both men and women. However, Chinese women have been subjected to all kinds of unequal shackles for thousands of years, living a life like cattle and horses. How can they talk about hygiene? Now that the women's world has opened its mind and is in a better position, they know that hygiene must be paid attention to. The structure of a woman's body is very different from that of a man's, so she cannot endure labor as long as a man. This is a natural disadvantage. Furthermore, foot binding and breast binding are the most painful things for women. However, in rural areas in the interior, these customs have not been completely eradicated. This kind of bad custom causes lifelong pain to women. In essence, it is more tragic than murder. This is the most unfortunate and unhygienic thing for women. I hope the local authorities will seriously ban it. Women's hygiene is very simple. I think what is more important than this is the happiness of the family. A family should be united in love and understanding. However, the most common problem now is that couples do not care about each other and have no love to speak of. Some couples are at odds due to economic poverty, which is most unfortunate. They should understand each other more when they are poorer, so that there is a possibility of improving their lives.</p>
<p>The third is the common sense of family hygiene: The same family has many different things in cities and rural areas. In daily life, I think rural areas are much more beautiful than cities. For example, although rural people live in thatched houses, the surrounding air is fresh and the sunlight is abundant. Children receive more than ten hours of sunlight every day, while urban residents live in pigeon-shed-like houses, where sunlight is not easy to reach. Eating is the most important thing for a family's nutrition. Farmers have fresh fruits and vegetables, which are the richest in vitamins, while urban people usually eat food that is not very fresh. Family hygiene is originally based on diet, followed by housing and clothing, but the habits of our people are the opposite. It is common to see that many children in Shanghai suffer from beriberi and rickets (i.e., osteomalacia). What is the child like? Adults can imagine. This is evidence that the diet is unhygienic. If a housewife does not pay attention to diet first, how can she talk about raising children?</p>
<p>The fourth is children's hygiene: Children should be allowed to develop naturally, and too much restraint will not work. However, cleanliness is of course the first priority for everything they need in life. Unfortunately, most families do not pay attention to cleanliness. It is best to keep children away from bacteria. However, once they encounter bacteria, they get sick, just like the flowers and plants in the greenhouse. They usually do not see sunlight, and they wither as soon as they see sunlight. On the other hand, children who adapt to the natural environment have the ability to resist bacteria, but the mortality rate of the latter is higher than that of the former. Therefore, the compromise is that children should not be too restrained or allowed to be too casual. Cleanliness and hygiene must be paid attention to. Middle and upper-class families in cities like to burn strong electric lights. When children sleep, the electric lights are still bright. They do not know that strong electric lights are harmful to children's eyesight and even to their nerves, and there is a risk of mental disorder. These cannot be taken lightly.</p>

<h3>Sister Hui (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Luckily, Xi-sheng had seen this brother-in-law once when his sister got married, otherwise he would have really suspected he had come to the wrong place; however, although he recognized the man, seeing his grand demeanor and his loud voice, Xi-sheng was stunned and wondered what to do. He truly regretted not braving a beating and staying at his uncle's house instead of coming out. Seeing him lower his head and not say a word, Chen Er-shao-ye naturally grew impatient waiting, and barked at him as if dealing with a beggar: "Your sister is out. Come back another day!"</p>
<p>After saying these words, as if he had fulfilled his responsibility as a brother-in-law, he turned around and went back inside. Xi-sheng, however, couldn't follow him in. Seeing the two servants beside him glaring at him fiercely, how could he dare to linger? He hurriedly heaved up the large bundle and backed out of the door. By the time he reached the last step of the stone stairs, tears were already hanging on the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>When he set out from the countryside, his uncle was kind enough to give him a bowl of cold porridge before he left. But after walking so far, the bowl of cold porridge had long been used up. His stomach was rumbling with hunger, and his legs unknowingly grew weak. He sat down on the doorstep of a incense and candle shop to the left of the Chen family, unable to walk any further. Fortunately, the people in the shop didn't chase him away, allowing him to stay there alone.</p>
<p>After a long while, three rickshaws came from the west side of the street. One of the three women sitting in the rickshaws seemed very familiar to Xi-sheng. Could it be Sister Hui? But she wasn't so beautiful before! Then he heard her speak, and it really was Sister Hui. Xi-sheng couldn't help but get excited. He was about to step forward, but then he didn't dare. He was afraid she would be like her brother-in-law. Besides, he and Sister Hui had always argued since childhood. Maybe she would be even less willing to take him in than her brother-in-law! So he didn't have the courage. He watched helplessly as she helped an old lady out of the rickshaw, paid the fare, and walked into the Chen family's gate with a female servant carrying a baby. Xi-sheng's eyes followed her all the way in, but in the end, he didn't have the courage to call out.</p>
<p>Sister Hui is back now. Should he try going in again? Xi-sheng pondered this question for a long time, but couldn't make a decision. Moreover, his stomach couldn't go a day without food! The problem of survival trapped this seventeen-year-old country boy. In the end, he felt the best course of action was to quickly go back to the countryside, falsely claim that his brother-in-law's family had moved, and he couldn't find them, and then mooch off his uncle for a while longer. He was almost about to stand up and leave when the servant who had glanced at him from the Chen family's gate suddenly came out, craning his neck and looking around as if looking for someone. Then he saw Xi-sheng and hurried over to ask:</p>
<p>"Are you the young master from the countryside?"</p>
<p>Xi-sheng didn't know if he was a young master or not, but he simply replied, "I'm from the countryside." The servant then readily picked up the bundle for him and led him back into the Chen family. Xi-sheng thought that his brother-in-law must have seen his sister return, so he sent someone to find him. But when he entered, he saw that the person standing in front of the hall was not the fierce brother-in-law, but Sister Hui, who he had always argued with since childhood!</p>
<p>As soon as they met, the siblings couldn't help but cry. The great love between siblings, in the context of a vast disparity in wealth, was finally fully expressed.</p>

<h3>Ling Shu and Su Wen (The Spiritual Pivot and Simple Questions)</h3>
<p>— Answered by Dr. Liu Xinbai</p>
<p>What You Need to Know When Asking About Illnesses</p>
<p>1. Letters must be written in plain language.</p>
<p>2. Do not write about "wind," "cold," "fire," or "dampness." Do not use vague "disease names" that are difficult to grasp and lack specific meaning.</p>
<p>3. Write about the symptoms, the more detailed the better.</p>
<p>4. Please include a stamp with your letter. Out-of-town letters require a five-cent stamp, and local letters require a two-cent stamp. Letters that I deem to have no value for publication, or those that patients do not wish to be published, will be answered directly by mail.</p>
<p>5. Please write your detailed address clearly.</p>
<p>6. Send letters to my clinic, 1108 Qinyuan Village, Xinza Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>7. There is no charge for asking about illnesses.</p>
<p>8. If you are asking about two illnesses in one letter, or several aspects of one illness—for example, cause, symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment—please use numbers to indicate them.</p>
<p>9. Questions are limited to internal medicine, dermatology, and venereology.</p>
<p>Swollen and Painful Limbs</p>
<p>No. 1 Mr. Ren Xingwu of Sitiao Lane, Nanjing, asks: My body has always been healthy, and I have not been ill for eighteen years. But twenty days ago, I suddenly developed a fever, and at the same time, my left elbow, wrist, knee, ankle, and other places became hot, red, and swollen. The pain was so severe that it went straight to my heart. I consulted a venereal disease doctor, who said it was arthritis caused by gonorrhea. I have always been clean and self-disciplined and have never been involved in any promiscuous activities. Later, I took "Salvarsan" and "Aspirin," etc., and recovered completely in more than ten days. But a few days after recovering, it flared up again, even worse than before. Please tell me: (1) Is this "gonorrheal arthritis?" (2) Can this disease occur even if one has never been promiscuous? (3) If so, what kind of treatment is best? Can "Salvarsan" and "Aspirin" be taken? (4) In addition to the fever, I also feel depressed. Is this because "fire is attacking internally?" (1) It is probably not "gonorrheal arthritis" but "acute polyarthritic rheumatism." This disease is called "Luma Zhisi" in Japanese and "Rheumatic Fever" in English. There are three types: single-cycle, multi-cycle, and persistent. Your condition probably belongs to the multi-cycle type. (2) No. (3) "Salvarsan" and "Aspirin" are effective for rheumatism, but since you have already consulted a doctor, the results of an examination are more reliable than asking by mail. It is best to consult a reliable doctor again. The most effective drug for rheumatism is "SinoPhAn," which can be injected or taken orally. (4) The word "fire" is too metaphysical. Please do not use this kind of wording in future correspondence. Rheumatic fever can easily cause myocarditis. The depression in your chest is highly suggestive of myocarditis. This disease can cause valvular insufficiency as a sequela. It is best to seek treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After answering, I feel there are still points you should pay attention to, namely: (1) Rest. It is best to be absolutely quiet, lie in bed, and not move. Wrap the affected area with cotton (dry or wet). (2) Diet should consist of liquids, milk, soft-boiled eggs, porridge, and soup. (3) Drink plenty of ice water. You can drink five or six thermos bottles (one pound each) every day. (4) It is best to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>Strange Child's Illness</p>
<p>No. 2 Mr. Ta Bin of Rongxian Hutong, Beijing, asks: I have a child who is five years old this year (actually four years old). He has not grown at all since he was born. He also has no teeth. Only this year has he grown two and a half teeth, one is the fourth left incisor, and one is the third right incisor in the lower row. The reason I say half is because they are uneven and don't look like teeth at all. He still can't walk. Even if an adult helps him walk, he walks crookedly and doesn't look like he's walking at all. His bones are very thin, as if there is no flesh between his skin and bones. But he still eats a lot. Some time ago, because his belly was big, I consulted a famous doctor specializing in treating bloating, but he couldn't say what was wrong, and the medicine didn't work. I heard that you are very knowledgeable. I don't know if this kind of disease can be cured.</p>
<p>Answer: Mr. Ta, you flatter me. Your letter is so clear and understandable. It is absolutely unique among the letters I receive every day. Your son's illness is so strange (actually not strange at all; there are no strange things in the world, Mr. Ta has just rarely heard of them), that it has aroused great interest in us. I am very willing to give you a detailed answer. I am afraid that you will not be able to see the supplement in Beijing, so I will send you another copy. Have you heard of the name "rickets?" Your son has this disease. The cause of this disease is a lack of "Vitamin " and " ". The symptoms are unnecessary to say, they are just like what you said. You certainly hope to cure him. Please buy "Hailimin" for him to eat. After eating it, you will feel strange, "Oh! Can this disease also be cured?" It is even better to take "Sinocalcin" at the same time to supplement the calcium in the body.</p>
<p>Breathing Difficulties</p>
<p>No. 3 Mr. Li Jianhun asks: I am eighteen years old this year. My mother, aunt, uncle, and aunt all died of tuberculosis. I have been malnourished since I was a child, have a poor memory, cough, and get out of breath after walking a few steps. I eat very little, am very thin, and my hands and feet are cold all year round. All of this doesn't matter. The most painful thing is that my breathing is not smooth. It occurs every three or four months. When it happens, I can't sit or stand still, and I don't know whether to cry or laugh. My face turns red, and a reddish-purple color. It feels like someone is pinching my neck. Breathing is very difficult. At the same time, I cough and spit up thick phlegm. Each episode lasts at least a week. (1) I don't know if I can ever get better (from the age of five to now). (2) Eating a little more food will trigger an episode. If I starve for a day, or eat something sour, it is lighter. I don't know what's going on. (3) Our doctor says it's asthma. Is that right? (4) What kind of medicine can I use to treat it? Can it be cured?</p>
<p>The name of your disease is "bronchial asthma." It is a disease of a special constitution. In the future, when injecting "serum," using "arsenic," "adrenal glands," and injecting "Salvarsan," you must pay special attention. The causes are "anemia," "weakness," "rhinitis," and "tonsillar hypertrophy." I don't know if you have these diseases. If you do, you must treat them first before you can talk about treating this disease. (1) If this disease can be cured at your age, it may never recur for the rest of your life. Otherwise, it may become a lifelong illness. (2) Overeating is a trigger for this disease. Sour foods have a curative effect on this disease. (3) Yes. (4) "Ephedrine" can be used, one tablet three times a day, every six hours, it is effective. Other drugs such as "Pacdin" and "Kresocal" can be taken. Whether it can be completely cured is not a matter of medicine, but a matter of hygiene. That is, whether the underlying disease can be cured, whether attention can be paid to warmth and cold, whether the diet can be careful, and whether the environment can be changed.</p>
<p>Abdominal Pain After Meals</p>
<p>No. 4 Mr. Yu Jia asks: (1) One or two hours after meals, I have pain above my navel, like burning and stabbing. Is this a stomach problem or an intestinal problem? (2) What about taking "Wei Bao?" (3) My stool is black. I don't know if it is related to drinking strong tea? (4) What medicine is suitable for treatment? (5) Can you treat this disease? (6) Is it dangerous?</p>
<p>(1) It is a stomach problem. It is a "stomach ulcer!" (2) I don't dare to comment because I don't know the ingredients of this medicine. (3) No. It is latent bleeding, which is also a symptom of stomach ulcers. (4) You can take "Biscama," but medication is only part of the treatment. Sanitary treatment should be paid attention to at the same time. (5) Yes. (6) It is not dangerous to life, but it is difficult to cure.</p>
<p>Poor Memory</p>
<p>No. 5 Mr. Zhang Yi asks: I have been poor since I was a child and have been studying hard. At the age of seventeen, I already had symptoms of poor memory. I often forgot things. I often couldn't remember where I put things. I searched everywhere, but the result was still in my hand. I can't understand what I read, especially foreign languages. It's very difficult. I like to fantasize. What I think about is mostly useless to me, but I can't stop myself. When I'm reading, I haven't even read half a page before my mind has already wandered off. I also dream a lot, and nightmares come frequently. When I wake up, I don't know where I've been. Please tell me: (1) Is this neurasthenia? (2) I like to read medical books, and the more I read, the more it seems like my own illness. My heart is burning like fire. (3) I have taken countless medicines before, but none of them have been effective. Please tell me a medicine that I can take regularly.</p>
<p>(1) Yes. (2) This is the worst phenomenon. It is best to abandon these kinds of books and never recall the words in them again. You should also not dwell on your own illness. You must know that this disease is not incurable. (3) You can regularly take "Hormspermin." Many so-called brain tonics on the market contain drugs. Not only are they ineffective, but they are also harmful. Medication is in the last place for this disease. The most important thing is to change the environment and abandon academic competition. In my opinion, there is very little connection between career prospects and reading books. Even if you finish reading a book and remember it all in your mind, the knowledge is only limited to this book. How far is the book from practical application? It goes without saying that even if it matches the facts, how much of it is actually used? I have seen bookworms who can't say a word to guests. I have seen those who have read "Arabian Nights" and cannot say a word to Westerners, or those who read a section of the mainland newspaper. In my opinion, if you are studying social sciences, you should experience life and replace psychology and sociology. If you are studying natural sciences, you should pay attention to practice. The foundation of science is in practice. Reading more books is useless.</p>
<p>I've said too much. I'm getting further and further away from the topic. I'll stop here. If you have any more questions, send a letter or talk face to face. I am willing to guide you to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>Is She Pregnant?</p>
<p>No. 6 Mrs. Feng Xueyuru asks: I have been married to my husband since last year. Until three months ago, my menstruation suddenly stopped. I often feel dizzy, my limbs are weak, and I like to eat sour things, but I don't feel their taste. (1) Please tell me, am I pregnant? (2) How should I take care of myself? (3) Or is it a disease?</p>
<p>Madam, this question is outside of the limitations of this doctor (this is an obstetrical question, and I am limited to internal medicine, dermatology, and venereology). This time, I will make an exception to answer, but there will be no more exceptions: (1) The symptoms described are not definite signs of pregnancy. It cannot be determined whether you are pregnant. A reliable method is to test your urine (available at all doctors' offices, for a price of about twenty yuan). Furthermore, your menstruation has been stopped for three months. If you are pregnant, after this time, the baby's heartbeat can be heard in your abdomen. (2) There are many things that should be taken care of. Due to limited space, I cannot answer them one by one. After confirming, consult a specialist doctor. (3) If the diagnostic method in (1) is negative, then it is a disease.</p>
<p>Is It Syphilis?</p>
<p>No. 7 Mr. Sun Zhan'ao asks: I was tempted by bad friends and went in and out of houses where women sell laughter every day. This spring, I contracted gonorrhea and a fleshy cylinder grew on the bottom end of my penis. I was diagnosed and treated and fully recovered. After that, I tested my blood and there was no syphilis. However, recently, I have been suffering from dizziness, headaches, back pain, weakness in my limbs, sore throat, body aches, and red spots on my chest, but they disappeared without treatment. (1) Please tell me, what is this disease? (2) What method should I use to treat it? (3) How much will it cost?</p>
<p>(1) There is a great suspicion of syphilis. One blood test without toxins is not entirely reliable, because in the early stages of induration, the blood test is often negative. To resolve the doubts, it is best to test again (note that tests performed within one month after injection to treat syphilis are also unreliable). (2) If it is syphilis, then anti-syphilitic therapy should be used. Inject "Arsphenamine" up to five centimeters (at the same time, inject "Bismuth for Syphilis" (Bismudol) or "Carbisin" until it reaches five centimeters, then stop for one month, and then test the blood again. If it is positive, further treatment is required. If it is negative, it is still not enough to represent a complete cure. It is advisable to test the blood again after half a year. (3) Each doctor has different diagnostic practices, which are different.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>Please Enlarge Chairman Han's Vision a Bit</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>According to a Jinan telegram, Shandong is cracking down on strange and outlandish clothing, implementing it strictly. One day, Han Fuju personally caught three women wearing strange and outlandish clothing. The Public Security Bureau also continued to arrest more than fifty people, all of whom were sent to the military court to await trial. It is said that women wearing strange and outlandish clothing parade through the streets, tempting young men, which can indeed be banned. Moreover, Chairman Han has issued repeated orders banning women from wearing strange and outlandish clothing, strictly prohibiting it. However, there are still women wearing strange and outlandish clothing who parade through the streets, disregarding the law. They were caught by Chairman Han himself. It is clear that these women deserved their fate.</p>
<p>However, women like to be pretty, like to be beautiful, and like to be fashionable. This is a common trait of women. Therefore, these women wearing strange and outlandish clothing who parade through the streets, although they are not as good as women who have read "Rules for the Women's Quarters" and "Daughter's Classic," who only knew the three obediences and four virtues, they are not committing any illegal acts in the modern trend. Because the current trend is too far away from the era of "banning different words and punishing different clothes."</p>
<p>Moreover, the so-called women wearing strange and outlandish clothing nowadays all come from Europeanization. However, Chinese women are not ambitious. They don't learn the spirit of European women, but only learn the superficial aspects of European women. Even more, they are not ambitious and become the wives and children of our weak country's citizens, instead of becoming the wives and children of citizens of rich and powerful European and American countries. As a result, they are regarded by the authorities as妖孽,魔障, and destroyers of good customs. All the unfortunate events in the country are often blamed on women wearing strange and outlandish clothing. It is truly unfair.</p>
<p>However, I do not hold such a view. I believe that these women wearing strange and outlandish clothing should go to court and should suffer. Regardless of their strange and outlandish clothing, even though it does not violate any criminal penalties under the current laws of the National Government, they should try the flavor of prison, because the laws of a local authority are no different from the laws of the country. People living in that area should have an obligation to obey the laws of the local authority. Chairman Han has issued a ban in the past, but the women in that area are unwilling to comply. Not only do they wear strange and outlandish clothing at home, but they dare to wear strange and outlandish clothing and parade through the streets. They should be as serious as 共黨盗贼 and be judged by a military judge.</p>
<p>A provincial governor bears the heavy responsibility of a province and should be well aware of the overall situation. He does not need to nitpick. If he grabs women on the road and interferes with their clothing in the market, this is not the behavior of a provincial chairman, but something that ordinary clerks do. Shandong Province has an extremely difficult problem in front of it, which is also a matter of life and death for Shandong Province. Chairman Han must face it with a spirit of waiting for battle. The responsibility of a local official is so great. The most important ones are the responsibility to defend the country, the responsibility to defend the territory, and the responsibility to protect the people and secure their lives. Chairman Han should not easily let go of this kind of place. He should deal with it with a spirit of unyielding, uncompromising, non-compliance, and non-cooperation. Only then can he be called a pillar of the country and a backbone of the country. As for the clothing of women, it is not necessary to trouble the chairman's precious hands or worry the chairman's spirit. The so-called豺狼当道，安问狐狸 (when jackals are in power, why ask about foxes). If you only ask about foxes and not about jackals, this is called prioritizing what is light and lightening what is heavy. If Chairman Han really understands this meaning, then he may not have time for this kind of cautious thing.</p>
