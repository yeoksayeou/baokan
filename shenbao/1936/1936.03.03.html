<h3 id="c15">兵役法之施行 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>兵役法定於本年三月一日起施行之命令已見諸前日報端矣査兵役法全文十二條係二十二年六月公布除第七條已經修改外餘無變易現一當施行之初願就條文擇要闡述以助國人對於現行兵役法本身之瞭解</p>
<p>兵役法之耍點有二（甲）爲對於人民服兵役之規定（乙）爲政府對於人民服兵役之管理事項後者純粹屬於行政範圍內容如何具見條文（載廿三年本報年鑑）今不贅述前者關係人民對國家之義務且與國家軍事制度及人民生活皆有重大之影響實卽施行之初最應注意之部份也</p>
<p>現行兵役法規定人民應服「國民兵役或「常備兵役」國民兵役施於不服常備兵役之人民平時受軍事敎育戰事聽令徵集常備兵役則凡年滿二十歲至二十五歲經檢定合格之男子均應繼績循「現役」「正役木「續役」之稈序盡其義務至滿四十歲時終止現役須入營爲期自半年至三年不等正役係現役歸休後之兵役其期六年已爲在鄕之軍人正役滿後乃服續役以達終役之年齡</p>
<p>上述規，　有一重耍之性質卽施行普遍是也夫中國自宋以來行募兵之制將及千年人民久忘執戈衛國之義雖嘗因外患之來盛倡復行徵兵之說而施行義務兵制於未受敎育人民尙難免有逃避之事今於不服常備兵役之人平時槪令受軍事敎育戰時同須應召則可令被選入現役者明瞭所盡義務之非偏畸逃避兵役之全無意義實施困難庶幾可免</p>
<p>又向時所慮施行義務兵制之障碍爲縣鄉辦理一有不當將擾及閭閻引起反感今則保甲之制行之數年壯丁訓練亦具成規推而廣之以施行國民兵役以徵選現役義務兵事有異於突創黎民之懼應亦可免重以人民外感侵侮身受匪患對於習武防衛已有需要及此令盡兵役義務亦勢順而易行此觀於去年江西實行徵兵之成績可以知之</p>
<p>目前兵役法之施行細則尙未公布與施行兵役法有重要關係之師團區亦未確立吾人在此僅能就兩年餘前發表之條文略抒所見至施行後之實際問題自尙有待於日後之檢討也</p>

<p>岡田首相之倖免於難、據云、係因其妹壻松尾大佐之有意將其隱匿、而自願代死、蓋松尾當時深知叛兵等之未能識別彼二人之面貌行動也、首相本人藏身於一大型鋼櫃中、由家中之僕役隨時以外問情形告之、當其留於私邸中之親友家人等、請准搬回遺骸時、卽已發現叛兵之錯誤、但幸而岡田首相藏匿地點、被其親友家人所知悉、遂能伏處於其妹壻之屍棺中、運出危險地帶、遺櫬運出時、叛兵等毫無留難、因彼等心中不知所殺害者並非岡田本人也、岡田至私邸之消息、直至叛兵屈服後始行洩出、</p>
<p>昨日滬上接得此决事變之詳情後、方知因事變而傷亡之人數、實較各報所載之東京電訊爲多、據云、死亡之總數的逾百人、多爲被害各大臣私邸中之男女僕人、</p>
<p>據云、此次東京事之發動、係在黎明之前、原來之參加者、皆爲第一師團之部隊、彼等全身武裝、並携帶機關槍數架、手溜彈多箱、分乘運貨汽車多輛入城、各一車入城之後、立卽分道揚鏣、其中之二三輛、分往各閣員之寓邸、並有數輛開往牧野伯爵之別墅及西園公爵在靜岡之私邸、</p>
<p>帝都警察及東京憲兵之總部、亦爲叛兵等所擬立卽佔領之地、蓋欲因此可免去一抵抗也、警察本無武裝、惟駐守各官邸之憲兵及特別武裝警察、確曾開火抵抗襲擊之叛兵、關於此點、雖難獲得確實之消息、但至少曾經有過一决巷戰、結果雙方各死一名、同時渡邊敎育總監寓邸之衛兵、亦曾開槍射擊駛近之運貨汽車、當事即有叛兵一名、倒地身死、於是機關槍即行開始動作、數分鐘之後；渡邊寓邸之木壁、已滿佈子彈之痕跡、渡邊本人聞第一聲槍聲後、即趕至樓下、親立門外之階前、致為叛兵所見、當即擊斃、</p>
<p>齊藤氏寓邸之衛隊、稍行抵抗、即被克服、叛兵乃一鬨入內、據云、在臥室之中尋見齊藤、即用槍刺戳斃、此高年政治家之屍身上、共有槍刺傷三十處、於此可見行兇者之衆多矣、齊藤氏之夫人亦受大藏大臣高橋被槍擊中、頓時殞命、然其死訊、直至星期四下午方始公布、謂其因傷致死云云、大的係欲避免發生金融上之恐慌、故暫不發表云、</p>
<p>鈴木侍從官長、爲被害人中之唯一能延長生命至數小時者、該氏亦於同日下午逝世、身上受有槍傷多處、</p>
<p>叛兵等對於牧野及西園兩氏之攻擊、幸遲到片刻、未能如願、在叛兵乘車馳到之前數分鐘、二氏均有電話警吿、囑其走避、西園公爵又靜岡警察保護、乘迅快之汽車出走、牧野則由一工人救其性命、將其匿藏於附近之小山中、比及叛兵到達之時、牧野早已不在、叛兵等失望之餘人、乃用機槍及炸彈向其別別墅轟擊、並用火燬去、以洩其忿、</p>
<p>至天明東京居民醒覺之時、（因除政府中心及各官邸附近之外均無驚擾）、該市已完全落於叛兵之手、電話局亦被佔領、除東京與大阪神戶間之電話綫外、其餘各綫皆被阻不通、東京朝日新聞社亦爲叛兵所襲、並搗毀該報之新式機器、又聞每日新聞之工塲、亦已爲彼等所搗毀、各報社皆由機關槍隊駐守、除叛兵方面所發表之公告外、其餘消息、不許登載隻字、</p>
<p>陸軍省被佔、當時值務之參謀部人員皆被囚禁、外務省只有下級人員在內、當時亦被拘捕、</p>
<p>內相後藤及代理藏相町田之寓邸附近、皆有兵士駐守、此二人雖與事變毫無關係、但叛兵方而對之、顯然有利用之處也、</p>
<p>事變開始時、襲擊各處之叛兵、原只有九百人、至淸晨時、乃有第一三兩聯隊及千葉砲隊加入、下午又有吳須第二十九聯隊、赤羽聯隊及其他隊伍等、亦與叛兵合作、至是其總數已達二千四百人、入晚又增至三千人、千葉航空隊當時袖手旁觀、東京灣內則有巡艦三艘、由橫須賀開到、海軍兵士數小隊開入港內、並有陸戰隊登陸、</p>
<p>當時登陸水兵之態度、頗引起一般人之推測、初以爲彼等有肅淸全城之企圖、但海軍軍令部長伏見宮親王、鎭日留於宮中、艦隊方面所收到唯一之命令、卽爲避免與叛兵衝突而已、第一師團之士兵、由其師團長掘內指導之下、在皇宮附近佈置鐵絲網障礙物等、均爲忙迫、參加晨間宮內之會議者、有荒木·川島·及眞崎各大將、結果向叛兵方面提出條伴、擬任命荒木組織新閣、不料此議竟爲叛兵所拒、並發出哀的美敦書一種、由堰藤大尉署名、略謂「吾人要求完全推翻政府·元老·重臣與政客、以及腐敗之商業利益、擬乘國家多難之際、而從中取利者、除非吾人之要求完全達到、則吾人將繼續奮國以反對陸軍中之右派份子、並摕除資本家」云云、</p>
<p>此哀的美敦書、可以表示陸軍中之極端派所以反對實業家之傾向、據某一部份人士之意見、以爲日本兵士每日祇得餉銀七錢、故習慣上常發通吿致居住兵營附近之人民、要求捐助、俾各兵士亦能偶然獲得少數奢侈品之享用、貧苦之人民、對於此種捐助、多不敢拒絕、故常盡力供獻、而較爲富有之人民、雖有力捐助、但多加以拒絕、</p>
<p>關於此事有足注意者、卽岡田首相險遭殺害、及加藤海軍大將之突然又露頭角、吾人當憶及倫敦海會之時、岡田爲參加海會之上級海軍軍官及首席技術代表、工商協定之成立、岡田促求之力居其大半、比及岡田返國、加藤卽憤其接受五五三之比率、遂卽辭職也、</p>
<p>各親王及軍事參議官、經澈夜之會議、始於晨間四時决定宣布戒嚴、但實際上仍無所用、因各官邸仍由叛兵駐守、陸軍及外務兩省仍不能恢復工作、一切仍在叛兵絕對管理之下、並堅持非完全接受其原來之要求不可焉、</p>
<p>星期四晨間之各報特刋、及特別無錢電訊、仍無甚消息可得、政府令人民力自鎭定、勿信謠傳、據云、戒嚴令頒佈之理由、一部份係維持東京球中之治安、一部份則係預防急進派之乘機起事也、目下香椎將軍已被任負戒嚴之全責、曾有一二處之叛兵已一度退出、但下午又復出現於該處、貴族俱樂部亦爲被佔各地之一、現在之事實、卽東京方面益無軍隊準備與叛兵作戰也、</p>

<p>— 匈牙利A．Grabowsky作不忍譯</p>
<p>在本身間題上非常重要的滿洲，在戰略上也是第一等的根據地：這意義漸漸顯明起來了。滿洲的門戶，即介於山嶺與海岸間的一條歷史悠久的道路，通達華北。遼東半島則與孔子的家鄉，富庶的山東隔海相對。</p>
<p>蒙古是滿洲的接鄰之一。因此滿洲問題引起了蒙古的問題。最近幾月來，日本人在蒙古境內非常活動。「糾紛」不絕的發生着。在蘇聯方面也有相應的反動。本來，蘇聯是把外蒙當作牠的領土，把內蒙當作牠的勢力範圍的。據莫斯科電訊，赤軍精銳十六寓，正在開往赤塔，將駐紮在那邊，預備隨時開人蒙古邊境。「滿洲國」對外蒙的要求，與日本欲使外蒙脫離蘇聯勢力範圍的努力，都使莫斯科的外交界引爲深憂。這方面第三角逐者楚中國。一九二三年，蘇聯就已明白表示過：外蒙應爲中華民國完整的領土之一部分。目前，顯然的，再不提及中國了。</p>
<p>這是大家都知道的：外蒙與內蒙有別。可是，除外蒙與內蒙以外，我們還可以看到蒙古的第三部分甚至第四部分。第三部分就是稱爲唐努烏梁海的蘇維埃國家。一九二一年九月，俄國承認唐努烏梁海的獨立，但在事實上牠是蘇聯的一個重要的部分。唐努烏梁海全國人口僅六萬人，而牠的首都肯木畢其爾聞有居民一千人。唐努烏梁海變成獨立，或者，不如說變成俄屬，是一九一二一年的事。</p>
<p>俄國與外蒙發生密切關係是從大戰前開始的。這是一九〇七年英　協約的結果。英俄協的劃分二國在亞洲的勢力範圍，把外蒙劃歸俄國。從此外蒙與唐勢烏梁海有併人西伯利亞的傾向了。唐努烏梁海是葉尼塞河的上流區域，被薩彥嶺與唐努山位圍着，和蒙古的其他部分相隔離。</p>
<p>方面說，　條流人貝加　湖的色楞格河的上流以及黑龍江的若干巨流的水源，是包含在外蒙境內的。</p>
<p>說到黑龍江，不免又復引起滿洲問題來。當俄國在滿洲尤其是滿洲北部發展勢力的期間。日本欲侵入蒙古是不可能的。可是，在目前，滿洲事實上隸屬着日本，這種密切關係是有効果的。內蒙立即受到威脅了，因爲內蒙的大部分，即戈壁高原是向滿洲傾斜着的。一般人視爲障壁的興安嶺，實際上不過是略有幾個高峯的丘陵地而已。滿洲占據內蒙，是滿洲人征服中國以前的事。滿淸在中國得勢後，滿洲政府和內蒙政府的關係就格外密切了。當時，甚、至外蒙也給滿洲勢力包括着。</p>
<p>從那時起，主要的通路是從中國首都北平起，經過戈壁，達庫倫，又經過恰克圖，達貝加爾湖與伊爾庫决克。這是著名的通商大道。在某一時期，這是茶商到歐洲去的惟一的通路。目前，北平與張家口間已經築有鐵路，從張家口以往則有汽車路。但亦從前旅隊繫盛的雜曼時代，那條路上却比目前鬧熱得多。在那歷史久遠的通路上的絡繹的旅隊現在是早已消散了。此項交通全被廉價的海洋運輸代替着。這變化使世人對於蒙古的注意淡漢下去，蒙古在不知不覺中從中國手中漸漸移到了俄國手中。</p>
<p>在大戰時期，蒙古重又引起注意了。在所謂「二十一條件」中，日本要求在蒙古東部的特殊權利。當時日本還是俄國的同盟；因此牠留意着，不提蒙古全境，只提及貼鄰滿洲的部分。但蒙古全部的讓與。實在是日本所願望的。</p>
<p>俄國社會革命後。日本立即施展身手。牠第一步在西伯利亞獲得立足地，第二部在蒙古與白俄台作，擁護斯端堡男爵，作叛離中俄二國的舉動。斯端堡男爵終於失敗，被赤俄捕獲，於一九二一年十月判處槍决。日本受英俄的聯合抵抗，又不得不逐步放棄西伯利亞。一九二零年十月二十五日牠放棄最後根據地海參崴了。雖然如此，日本的野心還是不死；牠靜候着第二機會的到臨。當赤俄與「粉紅色的中國合作的時代，日本擬定了反攻的計劃。打算從外蒙着手，給西伯利亞和西伯利亞鐵道，一個致命的打擊，使俄國這條重要的脈絡截斷。</p>
<p>日本對於外聲的慾望，因爲受了蘇聯鐵路的建設與規劃的刺戟，愈加亢進了。蘇聯所建造的聯絡土耳其斯坦和西伯利亞的土西鐵路，在阿刺木圖地方和中國密接，而且等候着一條中國境內的支路。直到現在，中國只有一條幹路，從北平起經過漢口以達廣州，其中自漢口至廣州一段亦未全部完成。除這直行鐵路以外，遲早總要加上一條橫行鐵路，經過准噶爾的舊門戶而達黃河上流，與平漢路綫相接。道橫行路綫將從阿刺木圖開始，從此阿刺木圖就將變成有世界重要性的交通城市。此路造成後，將使經過大陸到中國去的旅客免除假道於哈爾濱和奉天的迂迴曲折；他們可以假道於巴庫，裏海，土耳其斯坦或中部西伯利亞，直達中國內地。這樣的中俄聯絡勢必造成嚴重的結果。道就是：爲日本所有的滿洲鐵路將無人過問。</p>
<p>外蒙的佔領，使蘇聯控制住準噶爾—即蒙古的第四部分—的門戶。蘇聯又計劃着建造另一鐵路，沿那歷史久遠的通商大道穿過外蒙。一九二五年九月二十日，蘇聯與外蒙訂立合同：蘇聯有權建造從赤塔至庫倫的一條鐵路，並規定兩面各六十六哩地帶爲鐵路區域。當然，這一路綫，在後還要仲展到張家口去的。</p>
<p>關於戈壁沙漠的普遍的錯誤觀念，非辨明一番不可。戈壁並不是純粹的荒地，也不是如「沙漠」二字所指示的眞正的沙漠。允其是東部的戈壁，因受季候雨的恩賜，有着好些草原，是出色的牧塲。因這緣故，外蒙也許會把牠的國境擴展到深入戈壁的內蒙的。外蒙的社會機構變動得很激烈。在那里，喇嘛制度快要消滅了，因此人口膨脹得非常快。這結果會使牠有擴展境域的必要。</p>
<p>蒙古前途的發展遠非一般人所能想像。牠多半有着天然的資源。牠在戰略上與地理上的地位，非常重要。目前，牠的國際上的情勢正在變化中　。</p>

<p>申時社云、氷因大沽口外之商輸迄今已有逾二月者、事態之嚴重、為數十年來所未有、航商損失巨重、救濟無方、近來雖已利用飛機散發食糧、但杯水車薪、仍無濟於事、本埠壽康輪船公司之瑞康輪船長某君、最近脫險來滬、據其報吿情狀、極爲悽苦、茲特分誌如下、</p>
<p>脫險來滬</p>
<p>據瑞康輸船長某君之報吿、略謂、瑞康輪被氷困於大沽口、迄今亦已逾月、彼則於月前偶遇風勢順流、將圍於船旁之氷塊吹散、乃得設法離輸、輾轉來滬、向公司方面報吿、幷請從速設法救濟、輪船久固氷原、厥狀頗慘、既乏食糧、又少燃料彼亦會有一星期末進食、故身體迄未復元、其他各輸、由此亦可概見、且、　隻間</p>
<p>損失千萬</p>
<p>又據航政界消息、各輪船被困以來、津航政局卽設法辦理救濟、然以氷塊頗堅、鑿氷船竟失其效、至於飛機散發食物、因由天空擲下、故多損失、其能達於被困之各輪者、僅有所擲之半數、恐不能敷多數之一飽、但除此而外、亦別無良策矣、至於航業中、亦束手無策、難於接濟、約計船商損失、當逾千萬鉅數、近期內能吾好轉、猶難逆料、</p>

<p>哥倫比亞大學敎育博士、現任上海大夏大學敎育學院院長邰爽秋氏、年來從事鄉村敎育、提倡民生本位敎育等主張、頗為全國敎育界所注意、邰氏因鑒於現行敎育、需費浩繁、其內容又偏於傳授文字、為少數有間階級之裝飾品、欲求普及於一般民衆、殊難收效、乃經數年之實驗、發明一種普及敎育車、以救此弊、該項發明、前經邰氏攜往湖北江西安徽等省公開表演、博得敎育界不少稱譽、頃又經敎育部審查認為構造精巧、携帶便利、為普乃義務敎育推廣民衆敎育之利器、已通令全國義務敎育及民衆敎育機關一體採用、郃氏於昨晚七時、假一枝香、招待新聞記者、首說明普及敎育車對於普及敎育之功用及構造、並舉行表演、觀者無不讚美、至九時半始散、茲將該車構造功用特點等項、分別說明如下邰爽秋與其發明之普及敎育車攝影（國際社攝）</p>
<p>構造　普及敎育車外觀係一長方形木箱、長約一公尺、寬約三公寸高的七公寸底有三輪、前一輪大、後二輪小、可推行各地、車身前後之板翻起、可作黑板、放平則成為寬一公尺長二公尺之長桌、可供陳列展覽、打乓乒球種種活動之用、車上有鐵架二種、平時置於車內、用時取出、可搭成篷架、懸掛黑板圖表、油燈書籍、算盤等物、共上又可張置布幔、車架及車緣、有量身及量布之尺、車內備有活用普及敎育箱六只、分貯衛生敎育娛樂工藝、及農產展覽各種用品、用時可就當時之需要、任取一箱、背於　上、登山涉水、均無阻礙、車內又有活節敎育凳四隻、其中之二隻、即合成車之上蓋、另二隻則藏於車內、摺合時佔地甚小、展聞時可供八人坐位、接筍堅固、不虞傾跌、</p>
<p>功用　該項普及敎育車、因其構造精巧、全身各部、均可充分利用、其主要用途、計有巡迴文庫、游行敎壇、民衆報社、巡迥展覽代用會塲、平民書案·臨時醫院、合作商店、簡便工場、農事　導、娛樂塲所、露天茶園、十二項、舉凡文字公民健康生計休間等敎育、綜覽無餘、</p>
<p>特點　該車之特點、可以四字括之、即價廉用廣是也、該車有上列各功用、已為普通敎育機關、如學校民衆敎育館所不能辦到、卽能辦到、亦需廣大之舍宇、巨量之設備、若干之人員伕役、非費敎千金不辦、而普及敎育車之價值、合車身車架敎育櫈敎育箱等以及文字衛生休間合作公民生計等敎育所需之設備用品大小二百餘件、總計僅的八十餘兀、管理者僅需一人、用費之省、可以概見、此其特點一、普及敎育機關有固定地點、受其益者、僅屬少數、若一般民衆或因職業所竊、或以交通不便、或為舊觀念所枸、實少受敎機會、敎育效率、亦因以減退、今則敎育車可推行各處、山巔水涯、窮鄉僻壤、無遠勿屆、且終日巡迴各地、輪流敎學、一車之力、可及數百人、其中設備、可充分利用、絕無虛耗、此其特點二、綜此二端、即可見敎育車之偉大、費用之經濟矣、</p>
<p>應用范圍　普及敎育車之應用、至為廣大約而言之、有下列諸端、　各縣敎育局、敎育科、可和用該車、普及義敎、允其是敎育部實施義敎辦法大綱中所規定之巡迥敎育、更非利用該車不可、　各地民衆敎育館、農民敎育館、圖書館等、應用該車分化而為若干流動敎育館或流動圖書館、以推廣館外之民衆敎育、　各地民衆學校可利用該車、分化為若干流動民衆學校、以增進民敎之效率、　各地中小學可利用該車協助校外義敎及民敎、以訓練學生服務社會之能力、　各地敎師應以該車為總樞紐、指導小先生運用車內各種敎育箱、協助敎育之普及、　各大學敎育學院系師範專科、各地師範學校及各中學師範科、均應開設「巡迥敎育」學程、利用該車訓練學生、　其他敎育機關團體、均應利用該車協助義敎、</p>
<p>茲聞邰氏為應付敎育界需要起見、巳將該車交由上海極司非路而七百五十號敎育編譯館製造發行、現正發售預的、計全部設備用品大小二百餘件、預的價僅八十五元、期至三月十五日截止、邊遠各省展至三月底截止、該館並備有詳細說明書備索云云、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott　原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「這眞是我從沒見過那麼妙那麼趣的東西，特別是那些人兒，」賴司務從房裏跳出來這麼說着，他們已許他參與機密，現在事情完了，一路去，一路笑着，活像一個大孩子。</p>
<p>「他們來了；我聽見愛彌高叫着「陸上的賤人降罷，」所以我們必須趕緊去穿着起來，」南恩喊道，於是他們就急急忙忙溜奔到樓上去了。</p>
<p>男孩子們像一羣獅象，龍行虎步地回來了，經過了空氣的吹醒，他們的胃口可以使大火鷄戰慄，假如這個還有恐懼的知覺存在。他們都去更衣；在半個鐘頭裹，大家忙着洗滌，刷抹，裝飾，凡愛乾淨的女子見了，心裹必定是很快樂的。等到鈴聲一振，一隊容色鮮明的男童，頭髮光耀，領子潔白，幷且穿上了星期日的衣衫，魚貫而入膳堂，在這裹，蜀夫人穿上了她惟一的玄色綢衣，胸間綴着一球她所愛好的白菊花，坐在長桌的最上頭，孩子們說她「看去眞是莊嚴美麗」，這當她盛服的時候，他們總有這種感想的。小梅和南恩穿上了她們一襲新的冬裝，綴以顏色鮮明的束腰和髮帶，看去竟絢爛得像似一朵花台。坦第穿着大紅的毛織斗篷，和他一雙用鈕珠的靴子，看去也是耀目得很。</p>
<p>裴先生和裴夫人在長桌的盡頭相互一看，又見到兩旁各有一長排快樂的臉兒，覺得他們自己倆也得要有一點感謝，可是也用不到說話，因為一個心在對另一個心說着：「我們的工作正是興旺發遠，我們須得感謝，再去努力。」</p>

<p>工作概況</p>
<p>甲保健工作　　，環境衛生街道淸潔，採用各戶自管制，各家自歸自己門前的垃圾，並保持淸潔，此法可養成鄉民自動愛潔的心理和習慣，且必嚴督勸勸，方易收效，幾個月來，街道已漸淸潔，灰堆漸除，垃圾已不像過去的亂棄，鄉問的露天糞缸，取締很難，因糞在鄉間是一伴有用的東西，家家都備了一二只缸，做儲糞用，我們只得把有礙公共衛生的，和有礙家庭衛生的，教他們遷移或毀除，允許存在的，都用稻草編成草蓋蓋好，這方法不花錢，鄉下人家都可以做到。同時，把這些缸，用石灰水在缸外寫了數目的號碼，不許再有增加，去年年底，經我們編號登記的，單諫壁已有四百九十四只，廁所全鎮共有三十七所，由本處規定二種圖樣，着令改良，一種是防蠅式的，一種是去穢氣式的，前者是裝彈簧活動門，開紗窗及採光窗，挑糞處加蓋，這樣改良一下，每所要費洋十元左右，鄉下人已感覺吃力，故有十五所是採用防蠅式改造的，其餘的人家，都照去穢氣式方法改造，後者方法，每所祇費洋二三元，經濟困難的人家，勉強可以辦到，沿河一帶飲料水的地方，禁止人民傾棄穢水污物，人民已知道飲料水污濁，於大家健康是有礙的，互相規勸，互相督導，近來污穢東西已不向河裹傾倒，髒東西也不在河眞洗滌了。同時，規定茶館店要備兩只缸，一只供用，一只先把礬沉淸了備用，而且加蓋，茶杯和手巾，每天要放在開水中泡過，有關衛生各業，如茶館酒肆理髮店浴堂等，都經登記管理，添置各項衛生設備，溝渠淤塞，人民已感覺急需整頓，現由地方人士發起籌集欵項修理，技術方面，歸本處與鎮江縣政府會同擔任，此事正積極進行，的在本年三四月中開始動工修理。　，學校衛生區內有縣立諫壁小學洩溝小學前圩小學糧山小學四所，共計有學生三百五十餘人，我們初來的時候，為明瞭鄉區兒童身體健康狀況起見，特舉行一决區內兒童體格檢查，共檢小學及私塾二十二處，檢查人數七二四人，發現有缺點者，佔總數百分之六四·二，以砂眼營養不良皮膚病為最多，其缺點分類二四·二％，營養三一％，皮膚二三％，視力一六％，牙齒一三％，聽力八·六％，扁桃腺三·四％，其他一·四％，（一人兼有數種缺點者甚多，）檢查後，凡患砂眼皮膚病扁桃腺疾患者，均予以矯治，營養不良者，指示其植物性食物的配合和攝取營養分的方法，從這决檢查後，我們覺得有急需舉辦學校衛生的必耍，先就諫壁小學舉辦兒童衛生教育實驗，採用導生制，由各級學生中推選優秀學生共二十四人，組織衛生隊，分保健防疫醫務宣傳四組，由本處醫師護士，輪流到校訓練，訓練期滿後，卽由衛生隊隊員去教導其他同學，利用兒童接近的經驗，接近的態度和詞譬，去教兒童，實現兒童教兒童，兒童領導兒童的教育方法，衛生隊隊員，因為要教其他同學，自己便不能不以身作則，處處注意自己的淸潔，我們不時還耍複查學生的衛生知識和行為，以及衛生隊隊員的工作勤怠，加以評判，提高學生愛潔心理與自治能力，共他各小學及私塾，亦常派員指導，舉行衛生談話，現定本年春季開學後，前圩洩溝糧山等校，亦同樣開始衛生隊的訓練，　，婦嬰衛生鄉區婦女生育，都任憑舊式產婆或家人胡弄，往往接生，變成送死，本處成立之初，卽舉辦免費接生工作，並注重產前檢查，凡就診查者，皆吿以生理的常識，如胎位骨盤的大小，產期的遠近，及孕婦一切應行注意事項，凡分娩後的產婦，亦經過多决的檢查和拜訪，開辦雖僅數月，但靠得我們宣傳和母親會會員介紹的結果，信仰新法接生的人却很多，助產士吳若水，金佩玉，很有苦幹的精神，逢到雨雪夜裹，鄉下道路敗壞，連小車也不能坐，只得步行，最遠的來回要七八里路，然而他們很高興，不覺得有什麼苦，隔天鄉民包了幾個紅蛋，或靑菜，送給我們，再三的道謝，鄉下人一副誠實忠厚的態度，很可佩。　，產婆訓練班為減少產婆反感和喚起他們對新法接生信仰起見，特舉辦產婆訓練班，第一期訓練諫壁鎮産婆計共六人，課程計有一，產科生理解剖學大意，二，細菌大意，三，消毒學及方法概要，四，姙婦產婦之病理常識，五，臍帶處理法，六，臨產設備與手續，七，產前與產後護理概要，八，嬰兒護理法，九，產科用具與藥物之用法，十，假死初生兒蘇生法，十一，產褥婦看護法，十二，實習，訓練期定十四日，每日授課二小時，訓練期滿後，除發給產婆及格證書外，並贈送各人消毒盆，棉花紗布，消毒藥品等一套，五，嬰兒保健實驗處諫壁有接嬰局一所，寄養於外嬰兒共一百二十八人，留養於內者最多時八人，少至二三人，寄養於外的，每月由局津貼寄母銅元五千文，按月領取，嬰孩滿六歲後，津貼停止，該孩卽歸寄母所有，留局哺養，乳姆僱費每人每月需洋五六元，費用較大，故局方抱「送來卽寄出」的宗旨，所以內堂嬰兒很少，鄉間棄兒原因有三，一無力瞻養，二嬰兒有病難治，三私生，以前面二項的原因最多，送來嬰孩的背景既如此，而寄養人家的環境，更不看問聞，到接嬰局領帶嬰兒的寄母，都是窮無立錐的農婦，利用自己生育有乳的機會，再領一個孩兒，每月多得五千文銅元的糊口費，（有的為了自己的嬰兒死了，）在這種情形下，棄兒的命運，雖到了被救濟的接嬰局，依然逃不掉夭亡的慘痛。</p>
<h3 id="c211">食物對於乳兒濕疹之影響 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>乳兒濕疹常多發生於頭部顏面。其至延及全身。污水淋漓。膿痂層疊。乳兒因日夜搔癢。遂陷於不安不眠。致身體日漸瘦削。營養惡劣。且此等濕疹。多難一時治愈。竟有遷延至數月或數年者。考濕疹發生之原因。雖尚無確定之學說。但食物對於濕疹有一定之關係。在臨症上已可斷言。茲將食物對於乳兒濕疹有如何之影饗。申說之如下。</p>
<p>以食物為乳兒濕疹發生之原因者。始於一九一六年美國醫學家勃臘克芳氏。氏以食物對於乳兒濕疹之發生興吾。有重大之關係。近十年來。歐洲一部分學者。亦承認其晚。氏之試驗方法。對罹濕疹之乳兒。在其外觀健康之皮膚上。用刀亂切之。塗布以各種之食物性蛋白。或同時將此等蛋白稀釋液。用其少量注射於皮內。以觀其塗擦或注射之局部。有吾發生反應。結果在濕疹之乳兒。其局部不幾時卽生著明之潮紅與小浮腫。同時試之於健康兒或無濕疹之乳兒。則不現此反應。於是知此等蛋白質。對於濕疹之發生。必有何等因果的關係。如果濕疹因此等蛋白而來者。則除去此等蛋白物質。卽可治愈。但蛋白質中最甚者。為卵白，牛乳，母乳。因其最足以引起濕疹。今欲全然除去之。對濕疹雖有益。對於乳兒營養。可以發生障碍。</p>
<p>上述一種蛋白質可以引起濕疹等現象者。醫學上稱此蛋白質謂之「阿來而根」（Allergen）。因此「阿來而根」發生之濕疹等現象。醫學上稱之謂「阿來而奇」（Allergie）。「阿來而奇」實含有過敏與特異質之意義。然則此種食物性「阿來而根」發生之徑路如何。的可分為兩種。一為先天的。從胎盤而獲得。一為後天的。經母乳而獲得。倘有此等狀態時。乳兒從其食物中。如母乳或入工營養物。遭逐該異種蛋白質時。遂發生「阿來而奇」之現象。卽發生濕疹。但亦有時不發生濕疹。而生蕁麻疹（風疹塊），或喘息者。此尚未能得充分之說明。</p>
<p>濕疹之發生。既由於特異質與過敏。卽所謂「阿來而奇」之狀態。然則此「阿來爾奇」何以僅限於某種之乳兒。而非全體之乳兒乎。此在後天論。則須有一下述種種之誘因。例如</p>
<p>一　以全身傳染病為誘因。例如麻疹及種痘後。成為「阿來而奇」。發生腺病性濕疹等。為吾人所常經驗者也。</p>
<p>二　因局所的感傳誘發「阿來而奇」。例如罹發熱性氣道炎，流行性感冒，及氣管枝炎以後。常發生腺病性攝疹，蕁麻疹，濕疹等。</p>
<p>三　胃腸之消化吸收機能有障碍時。例如消化液分泌異常，胃腸發炎，及其他之疾病。或飲酒精，咖啡等刺戟性食物。損害消化管壁時。則尚未十分消化分解之蛋白質。通過消化管壁。入於血液中。始發生濕疹。</p>
<p>四　肝臟之解毒作用。因某種之原因而減弱時。</p>
<p>五　胃腸某部分細菌之分布狀熊。發生變化。被分解之食物成分。因細菌之作用。產生異常之有毒性分解產物。助長「阿來而根」之吸收。</p>
<p>六　內分泌障碍。例如甲狀腺卵巢有障碍時。</p>
<p>七　此外光綫，寒熱，化學物質等之刺戟皮膚及食物之變化。</p>
<p>總之有上述各種之障碍為先驅時。對於某種之食物成分。卽易惹起「阿來而奇」之狀態。而發生濕疹者也。上為後天的。至於先天的。卽從胎盤而得到「阿來而奇」。某種蛋白質。經過母體損傷或發炎之消化管。從血液入於胎盤。達到兒體。或其母體攝取同一之食物。其量過多時。均可發生。</p>
<p>引起乳兒濕疹之食物。在動物性蛋白。以卵白，牛乳為最高。植物性蛋白以小麥粉為最高。此外為卵黃，麥糊，馬鈴署，胡蘿，香蕉，橋子等。蛋白以外。則有牛油蔗糖等。茲述其主要者如下。</p>
<p>A．鷄卵　動物性蛋白中。以鷄卵為最甚。鷄卵允以卵白為甚。所以有人主張以卵白過敏為乳兒濕疹之原因。卵白成為過敏之原因。有謂由於卵白中之卵白質Albumin，「卵莫春」Mucin卵「莫可衣特」Mucoid而來者。卵黃則遠遜於卵白。故不足注意。凡過食鷄卵之母。其</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>所生之乳兒。或以鷄卵所營養之乳兒。易罹濕疹。或母體繼續攝取鷄卵者。共濕疹難以治愈。或竟增惡。反之母體之營養物中。除去鷄卵。則其乳兒之濕疹輕快。或竟治愈。以生鷄卵與熟鷄卵較。則生鷄卵為甚。</p>
<p>B．牛乳　雖較决於鷄卵。但亦屬重要之一。所以被牛乳營養之乳兒。發生濕疹時。認為有原因關係時。則不得不除去牛乳。但賴牛乳營養之乳兒。若禁止半乳。實為一重大之問題。不得已時則僱用乳母。或改用羊乳，長時間煮沸之牛乳，不含牛乳之食物等。可使濕疹輕快或治愈。</p>
<p>C．人乳　亦有人謂為有關係者。但多不重要。</p>
<p>D．鳥獸肉　此多非直接入於乳兒之口。大多由母體攝取後。兒體從母乳而來者。關係甚少。</p>
<p>E．植物性蛋白質此以小麥粉為最高。據拉脫耐耳氏之報吿。有一七個月半之乳兒。兩頰發生瘙痒極甚之乾燥性濕疹。乃詢其母姙娠中之狀態如何。則知其在姙娠中長食小麥粉製造之食物。又有一個乳兒。在六個月中全用母乳。後與以麵包。亦發生濕疹。所以經諸家之實驗。知小麥為植物性蛋白中之最甚者。此時可用米代之。此外馬鈴薯，燕麥，裸麥，大麥，米，玉蜀黍，胡籮卜，香蕉，蘋菓，葡萄等。均對乳兒濕疹有關係。</p>
<p>F．脂肪　此關係不甚大。有以為牛油可以發生濕疹者。亦有以巧克力為有關係者。</p>
<p>G．含水炭素　此關係亦甚少。有謂蔗糖有關係者。卽有某乳兒在牛乳中如放入蔗糖。則濕疹增惡。除去之則治愈。與以麥酒酵母則治愈云。</p>
<p>上述食物對於濕疹之關係。雖已有明確之實驗。然反對之者亦不少。茲略之。</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>舊醫藥科學化　新醫藥中國化</p>
<p>二曰：醫育之本國主體化，嘗考新醫學之入中國，其始係由於歐西教士來華之傳運，故歷時雖久。而敎會所立之醫院藝校仍存在於國內，國府定都金陵之際，曾有收回教育權之計劃，當時呼聲入雲，殊有振作之勢，惟迄今觀之，其成續果何如乎？夫外立之學校，其最大目的，厥為造就其在華事業下之服務人員，以便利其文化侵略，其最小手腕，厥為以麻醉方法消弭學生國家觀念，使自忘為中國之靑年，所謂主體，完全以彼為主體而不以我為主體也，故其所列之課程，所採之教本，所操之言語，所用之文字，無一不以彼邦為立塲，如是而望學生知以中國為主體，豈非南其轅而北其轍乎？是以教育權一日不收回，新醫學之中國主體建設卽一日不能實現，此其二，（按所謂教育權之收回，係指一校行政權不能操於外人之手而言，至聘請外籍學者為教授，則不在此例</p>
<p>三曰：醫政之本國主體化。一國有一國之主權，苟非殖民地之國家，其主權無不獨立者，吾國之衛生行政，雖直屬於中央統轄之中，而其實則操於某國托辣斯之手，此其中或有不得已之苦衷，一時未能擺脫，然左右隨人，動多牽制，求其自由發展，獨立建樹，終有所未能也，故衛生行政權之收回，實為當前之急務，蓋不如此，則以中國為主體之建設，終難免於荊棘之載途，此其三</p>
<p>四曰：醫業之本國主體化，孔子曰：「惟名與器，不可以假人」，以名假人，則失之濫，以器假人，則損於己；</p>
<p>蓋國無強弱，人民皆有其應享之利權，保障之責，政府負之，若以本國人民應享之權利，施於外來之僑民，則何異剜己身肉以與人耶？醫之為業，關係至重，種族之強弱，人民之生命係焉！故歐西各國，對於醫權之保障，不遺餘力，凡外籍之醫師，皆限制其開業於本國，良以非我族類，則痛癢無關，國情不諳，一方則危及人民之生命；一方則損及本國醫師之利權，安可以至無代價之民命與利權，為外交之交換品耶！吾國以積弱之故，為不平等條的之所限，對於外籍醫師，任其來華開業，至使利權旁落，民命堪虞；興言及此，良可痛心！間嘗思之，歐西各國之所以限制外醫者，其以國家及入民職業為本位之觀念重也，吾國人民國家觀念，似較西歐為輕，又向主門戶開放主義，以至造成今日新醫界喧賓奪主之地位，則其於本位建設庸非最大之障礙乎？故外醫在華開業之管理法規，誠有督促政府從速製訂與執行之必要矣！此其四。</p>
<p>上述四點，皆言醫也，請再言新藥之本國主體化：一曰外藥之管理也，年來舶來藥品，佔入超之大宗，每歲之漏扈，實有驚人之數字，苟一加考核，則良莠不齊，有有效者，有無效者，有過時者，有有害者，一概任其在華銷售，其餘民命至有所關，不僅利權外溢而已！往者吾國醫界有甄別成藥之舉，近則又趨於銷沉矣！吾深望政府明訂管理外藥之法規，醫界共負檢驗外藥之責任，以期保民命之安全，挽利權於萬一，蓋民命與利權，皆吾所視為國家之主體也。此其一，二曰：原料之仿製也，以上所述管理外藥之法，仍為消極之防範，未足以言積極之抵制也，仍為依他之政策，未足以言獨立之建設也，積極之抵制如何？不用舶來是也，獨立之建樹如何？仿製西藥之原料是也，故管理外藥者僅在消滅主體之障礙，而仿製原料，始足以言主體建設之先聲，此其二。三曰：國產新藥之創造也，國產藥物之有效，久為世界所週知，惜乎吾人委置不願，至使此至可寶貴之原料，埋沒於荒濱窮谷之中，若能以科學方法，一一加以研究，則可創造若干有效之良藥，大可爭國際藥學上一席地，豈僅抵制舶來而已！此其三，以上所述，皆言藥也，然則吾所謂中國主體之醫藥建設者，其有異乎空談者矣！</p>
<p>綜上所言，有消極之抵制焉！有積極之建設焉，二者相胥而成，相互為用者也，故舶來醫藥之侵略不除，則中國新醫藥之發展無望：醫育醫政之不能完全獨立，尚安從謀中國主體之醫藥建設耶？問嘗思之，歐洲今日之文明，實導源於希臘羅馬，然其輝煌燦爛，實有百千倍於當日之希臘羅馬者，何哉？以其能吸取希臘羅馬文化之精華而不淹沒其本身之個性也？中國由漢及宋，為文化之最盛時期，其時印度佛學輸入中國，中國之學者取其精英而融合以固有之老孔哲學，於是造成中國獨立之哲學，迄今印度雖亡，而世界之佛學，中國當居首席，於是可見中華民族，對於外來之文明，有吸收與融化之能矣！今日之接受歐西科學，亦猶當日之接受印度文明也，要在於得其精神，用其方法，生吞活剝，不問其是吾適合於吾人之胃口，而一概渾圖以納於腹中，其不發生腸胃病者蓋亦鮮矣！明乎此，始可與言中國主體之醫藥建設。</p>

<p>— 瞿亞宏</p>
<p>麻疹俗名痧子。這病差不多是小兒必須經過的一種傳染病。俗語說痧子這病人人是不得免的。生時不發死後還是要補發的。這種無稽之談。當然我們沒有聽信的價值。然而在小兒很容易感染的事實。確可以證明社會上早有深切的認識。不過因為來去研究牠的病原和療法。所以還是把許多小生命來不斷的犧牲。現在正是春天的時候。這病又在外面像雨後春笋一般的流行起來了。我現在要說說這病的來踪去跡。希望讀者注意。</p>
<p>原因：本病的病原雖然還沒有十分明白。但是已經確定它是一種傳染病</p>
<p>症狀：這病初起的徵象完全像塲風。不過咳嗽流涕發熱食慾減少精神不快罷了。人家往往不甚注意。等到眼紅羞光眼水盈盈熱高不退精神萎糜。見了紅點才知道是麻搽然而已經遲了。其實在初起的時候。要是在面頰部內面犬齒和臼齒相當的地方。仔細的檢查一下。一定可以發見芝蔴大的小白點。白點的的周圍。繞有紅暈。因為這是皮肉裹生出來的。不像乳斑可以隨便擦去。我們呌它做敲勃力克氏斑。這斑是麻疹固有的預兆。所以看見了這斑。就可以預早確定是麻疹。過了二三天後。先在面部發出像綠荳差不多大的紅疹。於是比較的很快地蔓延到全身。熱度也隨着增高到三十九—四十度左右。這樣經過一二天後。紅疹漸退。熱度漸降。同時就有像糠皮樣的皮屑脫落。病勢輕微。經過良好的就在這短時期內痊愈了。要是過了四五天以後。發熱還是不退。或者竟在中途。紅疹忽然消失。那都是別有枝節的表徵。我們必須要注意的診查。其中最時常合併的病症。就是肺炎·中耳炎·白喉·水癌·俗名走馬疳。這樣一來。那孱弱而嬌小的病體。怎樣受得了病上加病的磨折。自然是要發生性命的危險了。</p>
<p>療法：現在醫學上對於麻疹的治療。除了已患麻疹而在恢復期內的病人之血淸和患兒生母之血淸較有效力外。其他還沒有特效的良藥。然而一般對症療法。也是不可缺少的。有一樁事情。我耍特別希望病家大大的注意的。就是屋內的溫度總要常常保持在攝氏十八—二〇度上下。雖則說不能吹風。然而屋內的空氣終要使他好好的流通。溫度也不可過於乾燥。依我的經驗。患兒在韌病時期。還不知道是疹不是疹的當兒。病家因為經濟或者其他綠故。而把患者帶着上醫生家去診治。在來往的道上。不知不覺的添上了風寒。以致輕者變重。重者致命。病家不知還耍錯怪醫藥的不靈。這不是兩方的冤枉嗎。所以凡是發麻疹的病人。允其是弱小的乳兒。必須要早些送入病院。這不但於治療方便。還可免往返的麻煩。並可避家中其他兒童的傳染。遇着不能或不願送入病院的人家。也必須要把醫生請到家來。還該把其他的兒童絕對與病人隔絕。</p>

<p>第三期鼻梅毒　第三期鼻梅毒，在臨床上最易遭過。而種種危險病變。亦多於此期發生。也就是俗間所謂開天窗的一個時期。此期大都發於梅毒戚染後的一年至三年，遲則八年至十四年。第三期鼻梅毒的開始。鼻腔粘膜大都發生　蔓性或限局性腫脹。分泌增加。容易破壞而成潰瘍。鼻腔充滿黃色或帶黃褐色或綠色的膿汁。若將膿汁拭淸。則見潮紅腫脹的粘膜面。這種潰瘍其有峻峭的邊緣。牠的底面。附有黃色胭脂樣物。若至末期。則鼻腔變為異常廣闊。鼻腔的各壁。附着綠色或帶褐綠色而有惡臭的痂塊。此時常見骨質的缺損。或竟露出壞死的骨片。這種病情，稱為梅毒性臭鼻症。鼻腔內，最易侵犯的部位。當以鼻中隔骨性部為最多。决為鼻底及鼻腔天蓋。所以鼻中隔常致穿孔。如若篩骨鉛直板的前上部或鼻骨的下端。一旦發生潰爛破壤。卽可釀成外鼻的畸形。牠的形狀。彷彿馬鞍。故稱馬鞍鼻。有時病勢增進。遷延不治。鼻底卽能破壤。口蓋亦來缺損。言語的時侯。常帶開放性鼻聲。飲食的時候。飲食物常致逆流竄入鼻腔。如果鼻腔天蓋亦被破壞。則可引起腦膜炎及腦膿痬等等危險病症。此外病人自己戚覺鼻閉塞，分泌過多，鼻內放臭，容易結痂，嗅覺與味覺障碍，及頭部，鼻內，鼻背，前額與上顎齒槽部的疼痛等等症侯。</p>
<p>鼻梅毒既有上述各種危險病變。我們應當自己警戒。不可尋花問柳。萬一不幸感染梅毒。卽當趕速醫治。實施驅梅療法。如若遷延時日。不予治療。則能續發本症。遺恨終身。或竟喪命。亦未可知。</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一〇九問）　乳牙生出後，小兒的口腔，應該怎樣注意。</p>
<p>答　小兒出牙後，因為所食的物，都是些乳汁和柔軟的食物，極易粘附在乳牙上，結成黃色的垢，所以應該用藥水紗布或淸潔消毒的布條，把牙齒周圍，常常揩淨。同時牙肉亦要多加磨擦，使那部份的筋肌堅強，血流活暢。</p>
<p>（第一一〇問）　小兒的手或玩具，放在口內，有怎樣危險？</p>
<p>答　小兒的手和玩具，常染着許多病菌和污垢，若放在口內，極易受其傳染。故宜常教小兒不可使之養成含手含物的習慣。又宜時常把小兒的手洗淨玩具亦須選擇無毒質易於洗滌的才好。</p>
<p>（第一一一問）　小兒到了幾歲，卽可教他刷牙</p>
<p>答　小兒到了四歲左右，就應買一種毛頭柔軟細潔的小牙刷，先由父母把他的牙齒洗刷，漸漸敎他自己洗刷，每日早起和食後一决，須時常監督，並須說明刷牙的好處，牙齒潔白的美觀，以引起小兒興趣。這種刷牙習慣的養成，實為一生無窮的福利。</p>

<p>— 汪民積</p>
<p>離開廬山已經五個月了，最使我戀戀不忘的是盧山之雲。廬山之雲不是在牯嶺避暑的人所能領略的，也不是坐「四人轎」的遊客們所能欣賞的，而是要在晨曦中，暮色中，狂風急雨中，遠望廬山全景，才能看出這種奇觀。這些條件自然是漁父農夫們方合資格，我這當丘八的不過偶爾一飲眼福而已。蘇軾的石鐘山記說：「士大夫終不肯以小舟夜泊絕壁之下，故莫能知，而漁工水師雖知而不能言，此世所以不傳也。」我想廬山之雲，大約是因這樣而埋沒吧？</p>
<p>大抵風景較好的地方，總是兼山水之美，盧山的山勢是陡峭的，本身構成許多瀑布，銀河白練，一瀉千丈，幾乎觸目皆是。山脚下的鄱陽湖，沙湖，漁船，水鳥，以及水天相接處的雲海，更給詩人們以無限的廬山即景，何况供給大量的水蒸氣，凝成白雲的偉觀呢？</p>
<p>在晴天，薄簿的一層白雲，在山腰圍繞着，彼此不相啣接，像魚貫而行的軍艦，有時緊接在一起，一條白練鎖住了名山中享樂的人們，有時散成點點的炊烟，這就是山脚下無米為炊的窮人們的「空城計」吧？遇着「陰雨霏霏。連月不開」，整個的廬山都消失了，白雲深處，偶爾露出一二孤峯，若隱若現的神情，不知道是峯揷雲中，還是雲　峯頂哩！快放晴了，白雲漸漸的收歛，化整為零的游動，很從容，很瀟洒，像棉絮，又像楊花，有時鋪在秀勁的孤峯上，有如女郞浴後新妝，是如何的嬌艷呵</p>
<p>最好是晴天的淸晨，東方一片魚肚色，漸漸把紅光輸送出來，射着變幻的游動的浮雲，給伊抹一層胭脂的的色彩，紅的，黃的，淡黃的，點綴成一幅自然的水彩畫，朶朶的紅花，滿佈在茂林中，峭壁上，飛瀑旁，深秋的紅葉，二月的紅花，誰也辨別不出來了。</p>
<p>有次我們爬牯嶺，走到山腰，便感覺到另一世界了，多情的雲氣，老實緾個不休，上不見天，下不見地，已經是白雲深處了，到達山頂，衣服完全濕透，一陣風聲夾一陣奇氣，不是雨點，不是霧，也不是炊烟，有一股冷澈心脾的寒意，有一些感覺到而看不出的濕氣，這就是廬山之雲，也就是昔人所謂的廬山烟雨吧</p>
<p>還有一次爬　老峯，正在俯瞰周圍景色，驀然地一團白雲，由山峽中悠悠的起來，繞我們的頭上飛過，一陣可以嗅覺到的淸新氣，把我們的俗虎洗盡了，我想摘一塊下來，又怕拆散了伊的伴侶，有一位同伴看呆了，大哼着「廬山烟雨浙江潮」不止。</p>
<p>許多　　峭壁上，可以看到陣陣的雲影，從雲中射出來的日光，也是一陣陣的被雲影帶走了，有時懸崖上佈滿了雲影，雲影中射出一縷强有力的日光，使人聯想到下等影戲院影片中斷的滋味。</p>
<p>廬山之雲，是美麗的，是變幻的，「不識廬山眞原則上，祗緣身在此山中，」我想廬山的眞原則上，也就是廬山之雲吧！</p>

<p>診所四川路寧波路轉角。診時上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<p>淋病與攝護腺神經疾患</p>
<p>淋病初起木在生殖器部分，施治適當，即可於最短期內根治，惟因患者荏苒失治，與夫治不得其法，則痛累必致不堪。且往往致各部生殖力减弱，又為可懼之事也。淋病最易侵犯攝護腺部分，在神經無疾患者，處置失宜，終成攝護腺漏，而予生殖上以重大脛脅。若素身體虛弱與有神經疾患之人，則往往覺得局部痛苦不堪。如醫師用指揷入肛門觸診時，其攝護腺雖不十分腫大，亦並不堅硬，但患者一受到此種輕微的壓迫後，即起痙攣性之疼痛。甚者因此昏倒失神，而一般的皆有促發尿意，然欲去如厠，又感排尿困難；有許多人往往不能在有人面前排尿，而遺精。失眠，亦恒為此症屢見不鮮之事。總之，淋毒性攝護腺神經症，實淋病與神經衰弱並見之疾患也。</p>
<p>全年來處理此等疾患甚多，恒用「克淋儂」與「補體康」同時幷進，結果成績甚優，有百分之九十六七治愈，如住河南路之李貝澗君，患濁有年，時發時愈，痛苦不堪，曾經各醫療治尙未向愈，以致不能房事者又已年餘，夫婦感情氷炭，嗣以愈演愈深，並發睪丸炎症，始來余處治療，余為之用德國最新X線及電氣治療，同時令服「克淋儂」及「補體康」二藥，計前後治療五星期而全部治愈，其夫婦感情之融洽，有逾於新婚之後云。</p>

<p>生殖機能，實全人類繁榮之所繫，小之一國强弱，莫不視其國民生殖力如何而定，然機能旺盛與衰老，則視其人是否健康為轉移，大抵內分泌充盛，則生殖腺細胞，發育佳良，生機强大，體格雄偉，反之內分泌缺乏，或由靑春期手淫斵喪，恒見身體不發育，矮小瘦弱，生殖腺萎頹，勃起力不壯，甚或遺精陰萎，而女性即有月經困難，乳房乾癟白帶，性感麻痺，又內分泌不充分多患神經衰弱，失眠，記憶力薄弱，沉鬱悲觀，人生至此，更何樂趣可言，且欲亟謀補救，亦非服用普通生殖腺內分泌可愈，故德國梅倫博士，發明　取勇壯動物如獅，虎，海狗，猩猩及牛馬之睪丸精與雌性卵巢，用科學方法，分別製為男性『補體康』及女性「補女容」二藥，服後即能縣長發育，而治久婚不妊，失眠瘦弱等，在男子之遺精腎萎，性器短小，女子經閉帶下，乳部不發育得此均可重新改造，又因含有大量蛋黃素，用之男女戒烟，斷　迅速，並根除宿疾，免因復發而重染，藥性王道，毫無烈性刺激，若能連服一二月，並可使面皺斑皰，一掃而除，肌理細緻，膚色腴美。</p>

<p>淋濁向稱難治，不易根除，然自「抗淋血淸」療法問世後，成　昭著，開此項療法為德國醫界最新發明，造經彼邦各著名醫院及醫師臨床實騐，收效　　，在去年德國全國統計淋病患者，業已减少百分之八十五，最近淋病專家姚菊　醫師，特不惜重金，大　　到，在國內實屬空前創舉，施用之下，確證不爽毫　　如住同孚路王光明君，患多年老濁，　血淋　，睪丸腫痛，苦楚難以言狀，須　經名醫不　斷根，後經姚醫師行抗淋血淸治療，三星期餘，即獲全治，曾自往衛生處三次血淸檢騐，毫無反應，證明早歸斷根，近已完婚數月，雖飮酒　勞，未嘗復發云。</p>

<p>……科學與非科學之鑑別</p>
<p>托本司得醫刋去，科學與非科學之區別，即在於「新」「舊」之兩極端不同，科學日競，以向新的領域開展，而以前舊有之創造，即變成非科學終為廢棄，觀於火車輪船之逐步改造可知矣，醫藥為人類最切要之科學，故以最新發明為貴，以期更適合人生之迫切需要，所以淋病藥品，學者硏　日衆，冀獲一新發明，謀治淋之根本解决，幾經硏究室及臨床實騐，卒發現德國最新出品淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，無論急性淋疾，多年老白濁，均能澈底斷根，經海兒卡地氏藥學博士特殊試騐，採取患淋者之排洩物，抽出其新鮮活潑之淋菌，分置於兩試騐管中，其一雖加適量之熱，管內淋菌猶不全滅，而保有相當毒性，另一試騐管則取用蒸溜水稀釋之「克淋儂」藥液，滴入少許，卽見本來游離活躍之淋菌，立時停止活動，　人死亡，悉歸消滅，據博士語人，此藥若在人體內，更能因體中血球及抗毒力，發生偉大之猛力食菌作用，乃至肅淸淋根，永保不發，因此藥提煉係經過特種電氣，毫不雜有任何劣質，故一無　烈副作用及其他流弊。</p>

<h3 id="c233">再談「節育」 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>欲寫談言，苦找不到題目，不得已再來談談節育問題。</p>
<p>金聖嘆日，既欲死之，則如勿生，既欲生之，則如勿死，周公瑛云，既生　，何生亮，造化弄人，大抵如此，故老子日，天地不仁，以萬物為芻狗，人家有了產業，偏偏不生兒子，沒有產業，阿大阿二阿三阿四阿五阿六，偏偏來得多，所以嬰兒初生，必先大哭，眞有道理。</p>
<p>山額夫人的「節制生育」主張，所以我十分贊同，反對山額夫人的「節制生育」主張，我十分反對，不信再拿反對由額夫人之理由，一一加以討論，前天有個主張，說「優秀份子節育，而使不優秀份子生育，」這個問題，我前天加以討論過了，現在再把對「節育」的兩問題，加以討論。</p>
<p>說「中國現在都市中，雖感到人口稠密，可是農村邊省，人口並不稠密，寗夏每一方公里，平均只有一人，靑海只一三人，西夏只一六人，在這情形之下，提倡「節育，」當然不對，」這種地方提倡「節育，」我也說不對，這種地方，非但不當主張「節育，」並且應該像德國的希特勒獎勵生育，並禁止獨身，所以我决不主張請山額夫人到寗夏靑海等處去，實傳她的主義。</p>
<p>或者說，繁盛的都市中，多生些兒女，他日到寗夏靑海西夏等處去開發，不是一樣麼？但耍曉得，我國的國民性，往往安土重遷，地域觀念，非常之深，繁盛都市的兒女，是吾肯到西夏寗夏等處地方去，還是一個問題，這樣我們先當看淸出路，然後再來談節育。</p>
<p>說多養兒女，確眞痛苦，但是山額夫人的辦法，却是不對，我們應該提倡兒童公育，這更是去題萬里了，試問在現在情況之下，兒童公育，有絕對的可能吾，卽非絕對可能，試問有一分一毫一絲一忽的可能吾，我想此種說法，多不成為反對「節育」的理由。</p>
<p>但是成為一個問題，天然是雙方的，或竟是多方的，假定僅是一方，自然不能或為問題，無已再請反對節育的，再想幾個道地些而實際些的理由，提出來討論討論。</p>

<p>— 英光軍</p>
<p>我愛孩子們，孩子們也愛我。</p>
<p>每天天將亮，他們就來了，在院子裹玩，跳着，鬧着，唱着歌。</p>
<p>我寂寞的心情，我思家的苦衷，都讓他們給打消了，口聽到他們遠遠跑來，呼喊着，我精神就跑過去了。</p>
<p>他們中間才是有趣呢，有的穿着鮮艷奪目的新衣，有的在破舊衣裳上染些污點，手，臉，面，骯髒的，淸潔的也隨着衣服成了比例。穿戴好的淸潔孩子，我固然愛他們，穿戴不好而又骯髒的孩子們，我還是同樣喜愛他們，因為我這作先生的是愛兒童本身的，不是愛兒童的貧富的。</p>
<p>上課時，都靜靜的坐在座位上，眼睛直呆呆的看着黑板，嘴裹跟着我念，他們那種絲毫不苟的認眞讀書，正是他們的天眞處。</p>
<p>過一會，如果我問：「還有人不會讀麽？誰能讀？」那會讀的孩子們就高舉着手，不會的就緊低着頭，用眼睛溜着我，—他們不知道怎樣掩飾自己的弱點，然而這正是一種美德。</p>
<p>休息十分鐘時間，就是他們多事的時候，聽若樓梯撲登撲登響着，我就知道又給我添了事情。他們來吿狀了，不是甲打了乙，就是乙罵了甲，後面還跟着一些證明人，七嘴八舌聲說着，有時，我給他們和平了事，有時實在弄得沒有辦法，只有在他們的手心上輕輕打上幾板。</p>
<p>「以後還敢不敢？」</p>
<p>我追向着，被打的孩子就連聲說：</p>
<p>「不敢了，不敢了。」</p>
<p>就是打他們，他們也不恨我，反倒喜愛我，看到桌子上有一封未發的信，就請求盡義務代勞；看我的水壺裹沒有水，也不取得我的同意就去打水；看我課後鬧着無事，就該是臨到他們要求我講故事的時候了。他們頂愛聽故事，比上課時聽我講書還精神百倍。我給他們講「列那狐的歷吏」，講「安徒生的童話」，他們每每聽得不願回家去吃晚飯。</p>
<p>有時，他們自動的向我提議說：</p>
<p>「先生，我給你講個老鼠偷油的故事好不好？」</p>
<p>「先生，我給你講個呆子故事罷。」</p>
<p>「不，先生，我這故事是「會說話的洋囡囡。」</p>
<p>我按名讓他們講，講幾句又都不能繼續說下去，他們想着，越想越說不出</p>
<p>「不行，想不起來了。」</p>
<p>別的孩子們都哈哈笑了，講故事的紅着臉就藏到人們的身後去。</p>
<p>只有兒童們是天眞爛漫的，是率直的。</p>
<p>我實在太愛喜這羣孩子了，一遇到他們不在眼前時，就覺得坐不穩站不安的，我怕星期日，我怕每天的晚上，這都是使我因為失去了他們而感到寂寞無寥的時刻。</p>

<p>卓民開始寫信給，她立刻就有了多少具有Provocation的回信：她又到過那在H地的卓民的老家，她又和他……在卓民，他怎能阻止他自己的愛，他對於秋華的愛。雖然已是個結婚的人，雖然從前不是沒有過羅曼史的人，然而他總覺得他同秋華是無前例可援的；這也可以說才是他的初戀；不但絕後，更是空前。他才茲曉得戀愛是應該有這樣一種情味的。他從前所認為只有性愛，而沒有戀愛的見解，自己想起來，也覺得可笑了。他開始覺得戀愛雖是基於性，同時，却超越性；性的吸引力不能算是戀愛的全部，那是該有更高的部分的。</p>
<p>在一家整潔的布置着許多油畫的客室裏，看了許多畫，談了許多天，飮了些主人所厚待的洋酒，他們離開T君的家裏的時候，已經有些莫非靄沈沈了。走進一家舖子，在一間精緻雅小的房間對面坐着，看看秋華的捲伏的儍髪，靈活的梭眼，以及她的聰穎的神態，窗外疾駛過的一輛輛的街車凝思着，凝思着。</p>
<p>——這一輛輛的公共汽車都是空的，你瞧。</p>
<p>——是啦，空的，空的。卓民以沈緩的音調回答。</p>
<p>「虛空的是一輛輛的公共汽車，虛空的也何嘗不是人生，假如說沒有了愛」。卓民這樣沈思着，也不作一聲。侍役將熱菜一盤盤的拿了進來，又將酒斟在玻璃杯中——那怪好看的像美人的嘴唇那麽可愛的天津五加皮啊。各人喝盡了幾杯，也有了三分酒意。</p>

<p>— 洪英</p>
<p>夜像墨黑一般的濃。街是嬾靜的。我剛想從波達克廣塲回家，路過羅沙禮區敎堂後壁的那條呌薩克街的路。這　　，說它是條　無寗說它是條僻靜的　　，矮矮的房子，瘦瘦的沙　路，充滿了灰暗和沉悶的。</p>
<p>我低着頭，漫漫的跨開步走，為着不致感受寂寞，便輕輕的吹着　哨。當我吹過一陣亞美利加行進曲時，突然為一聲棲然的嘆息所吸住了，它是那樣的悠長而脆弱的，好像就在我底耳旁，有人輕輕用口噓着一樣；但當我停住脚，　　的傾聽着時，它便又遠遠的飄蕩開去，微弱的，寂穆着了。</p>
<p>我狐疑着，心里感到有幾分害怕。但我不相信這是有什麽鬼魅在作祟，就在敎堂頂尖便嚴肅地立着那熌熌發光的十字架，我抬起頭向它看着，又輕輕的在自己胸前畫着十字，便又吹着亞美利加行進曲，大踏步的走。我企圖着儘可能的跨開步，不顧一切的吹起　哨，只要通過這可詛咒的地方……，但是我底企圖失敗了，當我還沒跨上六七步路時，那可怕的悠長而脆弱的嘆息又來了，仍舊是那麽地悽凉而明析，幾至使我要吃驚它是緊跟我跑的；但是，我膽怯着，我沒有那麽大勇氣掉回頭向我背後看，我幻想着我底背後已跟蹤着一大羣獰惡的，饑餓的鬼魂。於是我更加多着對敎堂頂尖熌熌發光的十字架瞭望的次數，在身上畫着干字，又大聲的吹起　哨。可是這什麽都沒有用，悲慘地失敗。我深深地為一個奇異的現象所吸住了，我發現着有一個灰白色的怪物在抖動，沉悶的嘆聲是從那兒傳來的。</p>
<p>我吃驚了，站住。心想：這好像是一個人底聲息，但是為什麽在這樣夜闌識在慫恿着我；於是便提起步悄悄的向這灰白色怪物挨近去。</p>
<p>這個灰白色怪物，漸漸地在我底眼前明析起來了。我發現了一頭籖長的頭髪，又發現了一條白色的小衫，接着又是像一頭受嚇的穿山甲般的曲縮的全身。它是跪倒在一家石室外的台堦上，兩手緊抱住頭，全身輕輕的在顫動着。它似乎還沒發現我底存在似的，於是我便故意大聲咳着，又用脚在沙地上大聲足彩跥。這樣過了一會，它便抬起頭。兩隻尖亮的眼睛，一個細膩的鼻子，頭髪篷篷的散披着，掩住了她面頰的全部，從這使我知道它是一個年靑的女人。她向我迷茫的看了一會，才像　是突受驚嚇似的，全身抖動着，向我揚着手，膽怯的呌道：看上帝的面上離開我吧！又把頭沒在臂抱里了。</p>
<p>我忙退了一步，定神向她看時，才知道她是裸露着身體，上半身只披了那一條小衫，下半身便完全裸露着了，這使我感到興趣，於是便說：不，小姐，看上帝的面上你不能拒絕我底援助，我相信你一定是一個不幸受侮辱的人……，（未完）</p>

<p>求婚</p>
<p>人生都是矛盾的，虛偽的，自私的，自利的，誰都在這圈子裏過生活，在這裏劇作家柴霍甫的「求婚」是告訴人們一個眞實社會的反映，牠是這樣展開一幕喜劇；</p>
<p>伊凡洛莫夫是一個年靑地主，他很愛着鄰家史德潘丘布珂夫的女兒——娜坦麗亞。一天伊凡穿了大禮服去拜望史德潘，當然他去的中心意識是要向娜妲麗亞當面去求婚。</p>
<p>史德潘聽得伊凡呑呑吐吐的說出來向他女兒求婚，心裏已是快活得跳起來，馬上把女兒叫出來，叫他們二人當面談吧！</p>
<p>可是伊凡見了娜妲麗亞並沒有馬上就提出向她求婚，因此二人的談話談到一塊「沃樂微」草地而爭端起來了！伊凡說是他祖宗傳下來的，娜妲麗亞說是她祖宗傳下來的，她說是屬於她的，她叫了父親史德潘來證明，父親說屬於他們自己的，這時二方面的銀座不能立刻解决而大家互相惡毒的諷罵衝突起來，娜妲麗亞恨極了叫伊凡滾，伊凡被他們父女二人罵得昏了頭，狼狽的跑出這屋子去！</p>
<p>她氣得坐在安樂椅上發喘，等父親告訴她，伊凡是來向你求婚的，她聽到是來向自己求婚的，跳起來馬上逼着父親去把伊凡叫回來。</p>
<p>伊凡第二次跑進這屋子，她首先就對伊凡說這「沃樂微」草地是屬於你的，但是又沒有即刻談到求婚的事，二個人忽然又為了伊凡說他的獵狗「烏加達」比娜妲麗亞的獵狗「沃特加達」好而第二次爭吵起來，她說：他的「烏加達」是又老又壞好像劣馬一樣，他說：她的「沃特加達」不會捕狐狸，只會欺負小羊，就是拿五條「沃特加達」來換「烏加達」也不會換給你！二人銀座到無辦法解决時，又冷嘲熱駡的互相諷駡起來，她又叫父親來證明誰的狗好？可是父親又會說出來伊凡的獵狗太老和鼻子太短，伊凡聽到這話氣得心痛而死了過去！</p>
<p>史德潘看見伊凡死了去，急得要拿手鎗來自殺，可是一忽兒伊凡　會　　的醒了轉來，這時史德潘馬上把女兒的手和伊凡的手拉在一起，用力說，她允　！你們快接吻吧！</p>
<p>眞的伊凡和娜妲麗亞馬上就擁抱着開始接吻，雖然在　甜蜜的長吻，但是她嘴裏還忘不了說：「烏加達」壞！壞！壞！他說：好！好！好！</p>
<p>這時史德潘大聲用力的喊着「家庭的幸福開幕了，來香賓酒呀！」</p>
<p>「求婚」喜劇就在「來香賓酒呀！」聲中閉幕。</p>

<p>市音（一三四〇）上午十時至十一時</p>
<p>開篇「新黛玉葬花」</p>
<p>瀟湘館內一紅妝。多病多愁心自傷。她愛惜枝頭花美麗。春天早起服幡忙。命丫鬟挿在椏枝上。繫了金鈴將燕雀防。不料天公偏作對。時常雨大與風狂。將千紅萬紫摧殘盡。弄得。有樹無花不復香。賽過佳人遭不幸。紅顏薄命壽難長。那瀟湘妃子多情極。她觸景生悲欲斷腸。想起。自己嬌軀花朵似。偏多疾病如遭雨風殃。她頓生同病相憐念。所以。肩荷鴉鋤到樹傍。親築佳城將花瓣葬。在墳前弔祭淚汪汪。傷心痛哭沾衣濕。回天術無恨異常。因為。天下難尋不死藥。世間沒有返魂香。今朝我把殘花葬。異日何人將我藏。想到此間心又痛。在塚前拜別返瀟湘。他年焚稿香魂散。如花落飄然歸大荒。佳人雖死姓名揚。</p>
<p>陸秋霞雙珠鳳</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「王莽」</p>
<p>漢朝國戚與王親。王氏五侯朝野傾。假皇帝依眞皇帝。王莽登基國號新。勒索內宮傳玉璽。扣開皇后正宮門。含怒含悲曾擲地。至今嵌玉已鑲金。不能天下民心服。馬上為王十八春。漢光武。起雄兵。討賊開旗白水村。頓然東漢綿西漢。重整江山二百零。圖繪功臣曾建閣。傳聞二十八星君。初相識。嚴子陵。狐裘加禮釣江濱。假如脫却狐裘釣。烟水茫茫何處尋。天子屈留同一宿。夜來太史識天文。一足偶然加帝腹。客星己犯紫微星。隱居不願為官職。仍作林山歸隱人。尚有鈞魚臺一座。富春江上永留名。光武至今無寸土。方知天子不如名。樂得漁樵度一生。</p>

<p>昨天，「化身姑媳」拍袁美雲從南洋歸國省祖一幕，無意中鬧了」場大笑話，又幽默又詼諧，爰記之以博諸君一粲。</p>
<p>緣此幕情節，係飾袁美雲祖父之王桂林，接共兒子姜修打來電報云於常日船可抵埠，乃不禁欣喜若狂，忙打發家中僕役，籌備筵席，俾為其遠出悔外歸來之兒子姜修及未曾謀過一面之孫兒袁美雲洗塵。然會有袁美雲的堂兄韓蘭根者，極為貪饞，明取暗偷，每都因食積過多而鬧腹瀉。這天，所拍鏡頭亦正是韓蘭根偷吃東西場面。事先，導演方沛霖曾着道具部特地買了一塊錢的香蕉量在棹上，戲開拍了，韓蘭根的狼吞虎嚥，偷吃香蕉的奇形怪狀也就一一攝入了鏡頭，這樣在經過幾個鏡頭之後，棹上的香蕉已存餘無幾，香蕉皮也散落滿地。此時方沛霖就有點不放心起來，便鬧着韓蘭根這樣吃，會不會眞的害起病來。韓蘭根呢？他拍了一下胸膛屈起大拇指便說：「就是再來一塊錢也不要擺勒心浪…。</p>
<p>因為他既然是這樣說了，所以大家也就不再慮有他事戲也很順利地進行無阻，而當拍到王桂林發見韓蘭根偷吃香蕉大發雷霆，韓蘭根的滑稽表情使全攝影棚掀動起一陣笑聲的時節，無意中發生了一樁有趣的事情，把全體工作人員都笑得前俯後仰，連眼淚也流出來了。那就是韓蘭根眞的吃壞了肚皮，他是那麼慌張地捧着肚子一溜跑進廁所裏去了。</p>

China has often encountered difficulties and crises in both internal and foreign affairs for decades, and this has not stopped until now. This situation is particularly prominent in the north. The government, in view of the development of the situation, established the Jicha Political Council in order to adapt to the environment. Under this special situation, it has to take the responsibility to seek the stability and prosperity of the North. Chairman Song has reduced and exempted dozens of kinds of harsh and miscellaneous taxes in internal affairs in order to relieve the suffering of the people, and is urgently planning to establish advisory bodies to diligently seek the people's hidden suffering. In foreign affairs, this committee will strive to negotiate and seek international friendship and promote good relations with other countries based on the principle of mutual benefit and equality, so that the situation in the North can return to normal. In other words, it will strive to eliminate the causes of public anxiety and make it tend to stability. But it vows not to cede rights or humiliate the country, and to protect the integrity of our national territory and administration. The responsibility is very important and great. The relationship between news and foreign affairs is very close. I hope that we can help each other and work together. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin: The ice situation at Gukou was serious on the 2nd, and the weather was colder than yesterday. The ice layer in Gegu thickened by one foot. The Tianxing icebreaker and the Qingling and Moling boats of the Haihe Engineering Bureau planned to go out to rescue the stranded ships, but were blocked and forced to return at the fourth section of the Haihe River at the fort. The Hengsheng and Chongqing boats were scratched by the solid ice, and the front and rear cabins were broken and leaking. They ran aground in Gegu and asked for help by telegram. The shipping industry asked the Tianxing boat to go to the rescue on the 3rd. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Song Zheyuan donated 1,000 yuan and ordered the Tianjin Shipping Bureau to purchase dry provisions and hire planes to fly outside Guguang to rescue the stranded ships. The bureau purchased a total of 2,200 packages of bread, flour, and biscuits. On the 2nd, it rented the China Airlines Cangzhou plane to fly from Beijing to Tianjin and distribute them to various ships outside the port in three batches at 8:15, 10:45, and 1:30 in the afternoon. It also dropped a letter of condolence from the Tianjin Shipping Bureau and the Tianjin shipping industry. Pan Yaochen, director of the Tianjin Shipping Bureau, and Wang Gengsan, a representative of the shipping industry, took the first plane to fly outside the port to investigate the ice situation. They searched along the Bohai Bay to Qin Island, but did not see the ships blown away by the wind. However, they found a black shadow resembling a ship near the Da Sanhe River, 150 li southeast of Heiguguan, but they dared not fly close to investigate because the distance was too far. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Wang Gengsan, a representative of the Tianjin shipping industry, and others visited the Haihe Engineering Bureau on the 2nd, urging them to speed up the rescue of the stranded ships. The bureau said that three of the five icebreakers had been damaged, and the remaining two were small and unable to do anything. Later, they visited the port director of Tianjin Customs, who said that all rescue measures should be proposed by the shipping industry and the expenses would be borne by the customs. Gukou has been sealed by ice for nearly forty days, and 150,000 dockworkers in Tanggu, Dagu, and Tianjin have lost their jobs and are in extreme distress, all hoping that the ice will melt and navigation will resume. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin shipping industry telegraphed the Changan ship outside Gugang on the morning of the 2nd to inquire about the whereabouts of the ships that had drifted away. They received a reply in the evening that the ships were indeed outside the port three times, and the aircraft were providing food to the stranded ships. The shipping industry still only charges 200 yuan per hour for gasoline, which is donated by the Municipal Government. On the evening of the 2nd, the Tianjin shipping industry received a message from Tanggu that several ships seemed to be submerged near Nangang outside Gukou. Due to the interruption of communication, they hoped to quickly investigate. The shipping industry also entrusted Tianxing to investigate on the 3rd. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The National Government held its Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 2nd. Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Niu Yongjian, Deng Jiayan, Wang Faqin, Chen Shuren, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Chen Zhishuo, Chen Qicai, Lv Chao, Wei Huai, and others, as well as officials from various departments and commissions of the National Government, a total of more than 500 people, were present. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and made a report on the spot, entitled "Afforestation Movement." The meeting ended at 10:30. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Shao Yuanchong reported at the Central Memorial Week on the 2nd, "Make the best use of everyone's talents." The original meaning of the words is as follows: The Premier's will talks about making the best use of everyone's talents, which is divided into three levels of meaning: paying attention to education and upbringing, encouraging in a proper way, and employing in a proper way. The so-called education and upbringing should pay attention to the cultivation of specialized talents and ordinary talents. The so-called encouragement in a proper way is to implement rewards and punishments. The so-called employing in a proper way is to take "virtue in the right position, merit in the right reward, and ability in the right office" as the principle, and strive to make appropriate use of people and properly allocate work. As for making the best use of talents, it refers to the problem of applying time and ability appropriately. In terms of time, employed people should not waste time, and unemployed people should not be idle, so that they can all work hard for the country's cause. In terms of the use of ability, the principle of specialization is adopted, and everyone's strengths are used. Only in this way can the meaning of "make the best use of everyone's talents" in the Premier's will be implemented. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chairman Lin reported on "The Afforestation Movement" at the National Government Memorial Week on the 2nd, saying that the central government has recently advocated a widespread afforestation movement, which is the most important point in the construction of the country's material foundation. Our country is an agricultural country, and most of the food and clothing we need are supplied by foreign countries, which is a major loss to the national economy. Even the wood needed for construction, transportation, and household appliances is mostly imported from foreign countries. The outflow of interests is a major source of national weakness and people's poverty. Our country is full of barren mountains and wastelands. If we can use two or three tenths of them, cultivate forests and use them all for afforestation, not only can we increase the occupation of people seeking a livelihood, but in the future, the results of production can also supply foreign needs. We must know that China has now reached an era of national poverty and exhaustion, and the country has fallen into the position of a colony, suffering from the economic aggression and oppression of imperialism everywhere. It is not very easy to hold large-scale industries for a while, but afforestation is the most important one for the national production and enjoyment. Relying on the effect of natural forces, it is not very large, and the vast amount of wasteland and the large number of laborers in our country are most suitable for afforestation conditions. Therefore, we should actively and universally promote the afforestation movement, and we should pay attention to the following points: Increase the quantity by planting widely; protect the planted ones and make them grow and develop; study the planting method to ensure that every seed lives. The Arbor Day of this year is approaching. If we want to commemorate the Premier, we should start by planting trees in the field. In the future, all agencies, public officials, students, and the people of the whole country should follow the central government's intention of planting trees and work hard to promote the afforestation movement.

<h3 id="e15">Implementation of the Military Service Law <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>The order for the Military Service Law to be implemented from March 1st of this year has been seen in yesterday's newspapers. An examination of the full text of the Military Service Law, which consists of twelve articles and was promulgated in June of the 22nd year, shows that except for Article 7, which has been amended, there have been no changes. Now, at the beginning of its implementation, I would like to select and elaborate on the main points of the articles to help the people of the country understand the current Military Service Law itself.</p>
<p>The essentials of the Military Service Law are two: (A) the regulations for the people to perform military service, and (B) the government's management of the people's military service. The latter is purely within the scope of administration, and the details can be seen in the articles (recorded in the Yearbook of this newspaper in the 23rd year), which I will not repeat now. The former relates to the people's obligations to the country and has a significant impact on the country's military system and people's lives. It is indeed the part that should be paid the most attention to at the beginning of implementation.</p>
<p>The current Military Service Law stipulates that the people should perform "national military service" or "regular military service." National military service is applied to people who do not perform regular military service. They receive military education in peacetime and are ordered to be conscripted in wartime. Regular military service requires that all men who are 20 to 25 years old and pass the inspection should continue to fulfill their obligations in the order of "active service," "regular service," and "continued service" until they reach the age of 40, at which time the service ends. Active service requires joining the camp for a period of six months to three years. Regular service is the military service after the return from active service, which lasts for six years and is for soldiers in their hometowns. After regular service is completed, they will perform continued service to reach the age of termination of service.</p>
<p>The above regulations have an important nature, which is universal implementation. Since the Song Dynasty, China has implemented a system of recruiting soldiers for nearly a thousand years. The people have long forgotten the meaning of taking up arms to defend the country. Although they have tried to advocate the resumption of conscription due to foreign troubles, it is still difficult to avoid evasion of those who have not received education. Those who are not in regular service are now generally ordered to receive military education in peacetime and must also be conscripted in wartime. This can make those who are selected into active service understand that the obligations they fulfill are not biased and that there is no meaning in evading military service at all. It will be difficult to implement it, and evasion can be avoided.</p>
<p>Also, the obstacle to the implementation of the conscription system that was previously worried about is that if the county and township offices do something improperly, it will disturb the neighborhoods and cause resentment. Now, the Baojia system has been implemented for several years, and the training of strong men has also become a regular practice. Promoting it to implement national military service and selecting conscripts for active service is different from creating fear among the people. The fear of the people should also be avoided. In addition, the people have a need for military defense due to external aggression and bandit troubles. Ordering them to fulfill their military service obligations is also in line with the trend and easy to implement. This can be seen from the achievements of Jiangxi's implementation of conscription last year.</p>
<p>At present, the detailed rules for the implementation of the Military Service Law have not yet been promulgated, and the division and regimental areas that are important for the implementation of the Military Service Law have not yet been established. Here, we can only express our views on the articles published more than two years ago. The actual problems after implementation will still need to be reviewed in the future.</p>

<p>Nanjing: President Chiang previously stated that the uniforms of civil servants in various agencies were uneven, and ordered his subordinate departments and commissions to rectify them in earnest. He also instructed the Executive Yuan that all personnel above the section chief level must wear Zhongshan suits, with embroidered badges and symbols on the left and right collars for identification. Winter uniforms must be made of black呢, and summer uniforms must be made of yellow twill cloth. The Executive Yuan also scheduled to convene a review meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd to specify the rectification methods for uniforms. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: Sixteen years ago, discord arose between the United States and Japan due to Japan increasing its economic and political influence in Manchuria and Mongolia. This led to a frank declaration of American policy to eliminate the tendency of the Chinese government to lean towards any strong power. This matter was discovered in the State Department's diplomatic documents for 1920, which were made public in the first resolution of the day. The declaration was contained in a letter from Acting Secretary of State Polk to U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Morris on February 28, 1920. The letter briefly described the situation of Lamont, a partner of the Morgan Company, traveling in the Far East at the suggestion of the United States to supply China with loans from a four-nation banking consortium. It stated that the policy of the banking consortium was a practical way to ensure continued equal economic opportunities and commercial prospects in China. The United States was particularly disappointed that Japan was unwilling to cooperate in building a banking consortium. Japan claimed to have special rights and interests in Southern Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, and that these special rights and interests should not be included in the scope of the proposed financial cooperation. This was opposed by Polk. Initially, the banks of the United States, Britain, France, and Japan all agreed to participate in the consortium, but the consortium was not established because the Japanese government did not agree to it.

<h3 id="e22">Recent Situation of Salt Revenue in the Northwest <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The central government and the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai have negotiated for the Ministry of Finance to uniformly manage salt affairs in the Northwest. The provinces of Gansu and Ningxia have been implementing this for some time. The salt revenue in Qinghai Province has also been uniformly collected since February 1st of this year. Qinghai's salt tax revenue is over 10,000 yuan per month. Currently, the total salt revenue from the three provinces is over 10 million yuan annually. The salt affairs in the Northwest can now be said to be unified. The central government allocates 60,000 yuan per month to Gansu for political expenses and 50,000 yuan to Ningxia. However, if Gansu's salt revenue exceeds 1.2 million yuan per month, the province's subsidy will increase by 280,000 yuan annually, making the annual subsidy for the province's political expenses 1 million yuan. As for the reorganization of salt affairs in Sichuan Province, Miao Qiujie has been diligently reorganizing matters in Sichuan. Previously, the province's salt tax rates had more than ten levels. Miao has corrected this, changing to rates of four yuan, five yuan, three yuan and five jiao, two yuan and five jiao, and two yuan. The tax revenue situation has improved compared to before.

<p>London: This afternoon, King Edward delivered an address to the people at home and abroad from the broadcasting studio. At four o'clock in the afternoon, after the radio station broadcast national music, the King spoke, hoping for world peace and mutual understanding, as well as prosperity and happiness for the British people. This was Edward's 76th speech on the radio, but his first as King. Countless people in Britain and around the world listened to his speech. The number of listeners was unprecedented. According to reports from various places, the King's speech was heard exceptionally clearly. According to a Reuters dispatch from Cape Town, except for occasional pauses, the entire Union of South Africa heard his speech without any ambiguity. The same was true in the United States, India, Australia, Canada, European countries, and South America. Queen Mary was at Buckingham Palace, and Prime Minister Baldwin was at Chequers, both listening quietly via wireless. The King said, "It is a long-standing tradition in our country that a new monarch must address the people. Today, with the development of science, I am able to use the wireless to speak to my people, which is more intimate than sending a written message. This is not something I have initiated. In the past few years, my father has used the wireless to deliver a Christmas message to the public. Only two months ago, my father broadcast his Christmas message, and I believe many of my people still hear his voice in their ears. My father reigned for twenty-five years, and during this long period, many extraordinary changes have occurred. Great hardships and complex problems have been encountered by all. My father was always diligent in his duties, always thinking of the happiness of the people under his jurisdiction and protection, setting a good example for us. In times of difficulty, my father's calmness and trust in all the people helped to alleviate the situation. He shared the joys and sorrows of the people. I know that the autonomy must extend to India and the colonies, and the crown, which is a symbol of the unity of many places and peoples, is increasingly strengthened by their loyalty, which is due to their love and respect for my father. I feel that my father's passing is not only a great grief for my mother and my brothers, but also a personal loss for the general public of the British Empire. I now extend my respects as Emperor to the princes and people of India. Your expressions of mourning for the national mourning and your expressions of loyalty to the new Emperor are deeply appreciated. The connection between the British and the Indians, both in peacetime and in wartime, has a long history and can be regarded as an honor. The sacred trust of maintaining and strengthening this connection, as exemplified by Queen Victoria, Edward VII, and George V, is now passed on to me as their successor. My mother, my family, and myself are deeply moved by the sincere expressions of mourning that have come from all parts of the world. The large number of people who paid their respects at my father's funeral and the many letters and telegrams of condolence from home and abroad are something we will never forget. My father's great character was admired by the whole world. His popularity cannot be seen in empty words. My father's many years of diligent service were rewarded with the people's love and loyalty, as can be seen during the celebration of the 25th anniversary of his reign last year. My father was delighted to witness this before his death. Inheriting the legacy of my predecessors, I now bear this responsibility. I am the Prince of Wales, whom you all know. During the war and after the war, I had the opportunity to interact with people from all over the world in various circumstances. I now speak as the King of England, but I am still the person who has made friends with the people, and I will always be committed to continuing to promote human happiness. I wish for the future to bring peace and understanding to the world, and prosperity and happiness to the people of England. I also wish that we will not fail in our duties."

<h3 id="e25">German Propaganda Minister's Speech: Germany's Economic Life Destroyed by the Treaty of Versailles <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Leipzig, Germany: The Clean Market here opened today. The ceremony was presided over by Propaganda Minister Goebbels, who delivered a speech stating: "The Treaty of Versailles deprived Germany of its sources of raw materials and seized the capital it had accumulated, which was enough to destroy Germany's economic life. Those who negotiated at the Versailles Peace Conference all had one goal in mind: 'Germany will become weaker day by day, while other countries will prosper day by day.' Goebbels then described the worldwide economic panic in recent years, saying, "The reason for this is none other than the uneven distribution of raw materials, the reversal of the principles of trade, the confusion and mistakes of capitalists, the instability of currency, and the violation of the natural order in the accounting system. In short, the circulation of huge amounts of gold is not enough to create national happiness. For example, the United States now has gold worth 24,600,000,000 yuan, almost half of the world's gold reserves. But even with so much gold, is the welfare of the United States better than that of other countries? The answer is no. The United States has a total of nine million unemployed people, which shows that the United States is still in a state of calamity. In Germany, since the National Socialist Party came to power, the number of unemployed people has decreased by five million. Recently, in the industrial sector, three new substitutes have been invented: artificial oil (i.e., petroleum spirit), artificial fibers, and artificial rubber. Among them, if the manufacturing plan for artificial fibers is fully realized, Germany's current imports of fibers can be reduced by 25%." (1st Day Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: War Minister Kawashima is determined to actively advise Saionji to form a national unity cabinet, and is determined to devote all his efforts to thoroughly suppress the military, so as to avoid any more unfortunate incidents. The long-term and immediate causes of this incident lie in the defects of the social organization and the accumulation of malpractices in the political world for many years, which is well known to everyone. Therefore, those who are in charge of the regime should carefully consider the situation and implement politics that conform to the extraordinary times, so as to meet the expectations of the people.

In addition, privy councilors met with the Emperor separately to report on the situation.

All these senior statesmen will gather in Tokyo in the next two days. During his stay in Tokyo, Saionji will temporarily reside at the Imperial Household Ministry in the Imperial Palace. After responding to the Emperor's inquiries, he will convene a meeting of senior statesmen there. (2nd Day Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Duke Saionji arrived here at 3:25 p.m. today and immediately entered the palace. Privy Council Ministers and Cabinet members greeted him at the palace gate. Duke Saionji is currently staying in the palace. The Emperor will consult him on the selection of a new Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. The previous Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Viscount Saito, was killed by mutinous soldiers on Wednesday. This position is very important and should not be left vacant for long, as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal is the liaison between the Emperor and the government. Duke Saionji will, as usual, recommend candidates for the new Prime Minister, but due to the complex situation, it will take several days to make a decision. He will convene a meeting of Count Makino, Count Kiyoura, Baron Iki, Baron Wakatsuki, Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa, and the current Prime Minister Okada to discuss this matter. Reports say that the new cabinet will be a cabinet of capable people, but without Fascist elements. Before appointing a new Prime Minister, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal will be selected first.

<p>Okitsu: Duke Saionji, accompanied by his adopted son Hachiro, Kumao Harada, Kojuro Nakagawa, and other attendants, arrived in Shizuoka at 11:30 a.m. this morning. He took a train to Tokyo at 12:30 p.m. and is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo at 3:30 p.m. If he is received by the Emperor and asked about the formation of a cabinet, he will naturally seek the opinions of the military and senior statesmen such as Kiyoura, Makino, and Wakatsuki. In order to deeply understand the current situation, he will break with tradition and solicit the opinions of promising newcomers in a wide range for reference. It is now widely rumored that the following people are candidates to succeed the cabinet: Privy Councilor and Army General Kawai Masao, Privy Council Chairman Hiranuma Kiichirō, President of the House of Peers Konoe Fumimaro, Army General Araki Sadao, Count Kiyoura Keigo, and Baron Yamamoto Tatsuo.

Then, the highest headquarters, based on this report, deliberated until late at night. As a result, regarding the formation of a cabinet, if Duke Saionji seeks the opinion of the military, it was decided to answer with: 1. Thoroughly implement the suppression of the military, 2. Realize a powerful and capable national unity cabinet. (2nd Day Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Army side, in view of the seriousness of this incident, hopes that the person to succeed as Prime Minister will meet the following objectives: 1. Regarding the fundamental policy of national policy, 2. Thoroughly correct the National Army. Regarding this matter, the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters should conduct important deliberations and achieve results. The Army hopes that the next cabinet will thoroughly implement various policies and form a truly powerful national unity cabinet. Its leader does not necessarily have to be an elder or an established politician, nor a general in the army or navy. New talents must be promoted. War Minister Kawashima will open the general intentions of the military when Duke Saionji seeks his opinion. (2nd Day Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the opinions of senior Navy officials, the new cabinet must have the power to handle the aftermath of the major events to come, deal with the current situation, break the current deadlock in Japan, and establish a fundamental national policy. The new cabinet should strengthen national defense in the face of the extraordinary international situation, and fundamentally reform domestic affairs. Its personnel should be selected from outside the army and navy, and a powerful national unity cabinet should be formed. (2nd Day Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: On the 29th, the Army authorities ordered the dismissal of the instigating officers of the riot incident from their posts. The Imperial Household Ministry also issued an order on the same day, ordering the return of their ranks. (2nd Day Nichiren Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Five police officers were killed while performing their duties during the incident on Wednesday. The public expressed deep sympathy for them, and 5,000 yuan has been donated to provide for their families. (2nd Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The regular March personnel changes in the Army were internally ordered last month, and were scheduled to be formally ordered on the 2nd of this month. However, due to the incident, the contents have been revised, so the order has been temporarily postponed. (2nd Day Domei Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Machida, the Minister of Commerce currently holding the position of Finance Minister, told reporters today that the candidate for the new Prime Minister will be selected in two or three days. He believes that the new cabinet will be a national unity cabinet, representing various political parties and other forces. At the same time, leaders of the economic and financial circles have expressed their opinion that the new cabinet must not be of a Fascist nature. (2nd Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: On the day of the end of the incident, the financial and economic circles are paying close attention to the future trends and who will be recommended as the leader of the next cabinet. Because the financial circles lost Finance Minister Takahashi, a pillar, due to this incident, there are not a few people who are quite concerned about whether the method of gradually reducing public debt and the sound financial policy will be adhered to in the future. In the event of any shake-up, the impact on the general financial circles is a matter of concern. Therefore, there is a strong desire for the leader of the next cabinet not to break this iron rule. Although the financial circles hope to build a national unity and cooperative cabinet, its power must first be able to deal with the current situation. However, if the current economic structure is merely modified, there is a fear that this will cause drastic changes in the entire finances, and even plunge the economic world into extreme chaos. It is believed that it is imperative to avoid the emergence of such a cabinet in the future. (1st Day Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Okada's Escape: First Hidden in a Large Iron Box, Later Concealed in His Brother-in-Law's Coffin; Rebel Troops Opposed Araki's Cabinet Formation <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Foreign Press) According to a report in the Shanghai-based North-China Daily News, the following detailed account of the Tokyo Incident was obtained via wireless telegraph yesterday:</p>
<p>Premier Okada's escape from death is said to be due to his brother-in-law, Colonel Matsuo, intentionally concealing him and voluntarily sacrificing himself. Matsuo was well aware that the rebel soldiers were unable to distinguish between the two men's faces and movements. The Premier himself hid in a large steel cabinet, with servants in the house constantly informing him of the situation outside. When family and friends remaining in the private residence requested permission to move the remains, the rebels' mistake was immediately discovered. Fortunately, Premier Okada's hiding place was known to his family and friends, and he was able to conceal himself in his brother-in-law's coffin, which was then transported out of the danger zone. The rebel soldiers did not create any difficulty when the coffin was carried out, as they were unaware that the person they had killed was not Okada himself. News of Okada's arrival at the private residence did not leak out until after the rebel soldiers had surrendered.</p>
<p>After receiving the details of the incident in Shanghai yesterday, it became clear that the number of people killed and injured in the incident was actually higher than reported in the Tokyo dispatches of various newspapers. It is said that the total number of deaths exceeded one hundred, many of whom were male and female servants in the private residences of the ministers who were attacked.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Tokyo incident was launched before dawn. The original participants were all troops from the First Division. They were fully armed, carrying several machine guns and many boxes of hand grenades. They entered the city in multiple freight trucks. After entering the city, each truck immediately dispersed in different directions. Two or three of them went to the residences of various cabinet members, and several others drove to Count Makino's villa and Duke Saionji's private residence in Shizuoka.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Imperial Capital Police and the Tokyo Military Police were also among the places the rebel soldiers planned to occupy immediately, in order to avoid resistance. The police were generally unarmed, but the military police and specially armed police stationed at various official residences did open fire to resist the attacking rebel soldiers. Although it is difficult to obtain accurate information on this point, there was at least one street battle. As a result, one person on each side died. At the same time, the guards at the residence of Watanabe, the Director-General of Education, also fired at the approaching freight trucks. One rebel soldier immediately fell to the ground and died. The machine guns then began to operate. After a few minutes, the wooden walls of Watanabe's residence were covered with bullet marks. Watanabe himself, hearing the first gunshot, rushed downstairs and stood on the steps outside the door, where he was seen by the rebel soldiers and immediately shot dead.</p>
<p>The guards at Saito's residence put up some resistance, but were quickly overcome. The rebel soldiers then rushed inside. It is said that they found Saito in the bedroom and stabbed him to death with bayonets. The body of this elderly statesman had thirty bayonet wounds, which shows how many people were involved in the attack. Saito's wife was also injured. Finance Minister Takahashi was shot and died instantly. However, his death was not announced until Thursday afternoon, and was attributed to injuries, apparently to avoid financial panic.</p>
<p>Grand Chamberlain Suzuki was the only victim who lived for several hours. He also passed away that afternoon, having suffered multiple gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>The rebel soldiers' attacks on Makino and Saionji were fortunately delayed by a moment, and they were unable to achieve their goals. A few minutes before the rebel soldiers arrived by car, both men received telephone warnings, urging them to flee. Duke Saionji was also protected by the Shizuoka police and left in a fast car. Makino was rescued by a worker who hid him in a nearby small mountain. By the time the rebel soldiers arrived, Makino was long gone. Disappointed, the rebel soldiers bombarded his villa with machine guns and bombs, and then burned it down to vent their anger.</p>
<p>By the time the residents of Tokyo woke up the next morning (as there was no disturbance except in the government center and near various official residences), the city was completely in the hands of the rebel soldiers. The telephone exchange was also occupied. Except for the telephone lines between Tokyo and Osaka and Kobe, all other lines were blocked. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun newspaper was also attacked by the rebel soldiers, who destroyed the newspaper's new equipment. It is also reported that the factory of the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper was also destroyed by them. Each newspaper office was guarded by a machine gun squad. Apart from announcements released by the rebel soldiers, no other news was allowed to be published.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Army was occupied, and the staff of the General Staff who were on duty at the time were imprisoned. Only lower-level personnel were present in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they were also arrested at that time.</p>
<p>Soldiers were stationed near the residences of Interior Minister Goto and Acting Finance Minister Machida. Although these two men had nothing to do with the incident, the rebel soldiers apparently had some use for them.</p>
<p>When the incident began, there were only nine hundred rebel soldiers attacking various locations. By early morning, the 1st and 3rd Regiments and the Chiba Artillery Regiment had joined them. In the afternoon, the Kure 29th Regiment, the Akabane Regiment, and other units also cooperated with the rebel soldiers, bringing their total number to 2,400. By evening, it had increased to 3,000. The Chiba Air Corps stood by and watched. Three cruisers from Yokosuka arrived in Tokyo Bay, and several platoons of naval soldiers entered the port and landed.</p>
<p>The attitude of the landing sailors at the time caused a great deal of speculation. Initially, it was thought that they intended to pacify the entire city, but Fleet Admiral Prince Fushimi stayed in the palace all day. The only order received by the fleet was to avoid conflict with the rebel soldiers. The soldiers of the First Division, under the guidance of their divisional commander, Horinouchi, were busy erecting barbed wire obstacles near the Imperial Palace. Those who attended the morning meeting in the palace included Generals Araki, Kawashima, and Mazaki. As a result, they proposed terms to the rebel soldiers, intending to appoint Araki to form a new cabinet. Unexpectedly, this proposal was rejected by the rebel soldiers, who issued a kind of ultimatum, signed by Captain Ezaki, which stated roughly: "We demand the complete overthrow of the government, the elders, the senior officials, and the politicians, as well as the corrupt commercial interests, who seek to profit from the nation's difficulties. Unless our demands are completely met, we will continue to fight against the right-wing elements in the army and eliminate the capitalists."</p>
<p>This ultimatum can be seen as expressing the extreme faction in the army's opposition to industrialists. According to the opinion of some people, since Japanese soldiers receive only seven sen in pay each day, it is customary to issue notices to the people living near the barracks, requesting donations so that the soldiers can occasionally enjoy a few luxuries. The poor people dare not refuse such donations, and often contribute as much as they can. The wealthier people, although able to donate, often refuse.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy about this matter is Premier Okada's narrow escape from assassination, and the sudden re-emergence of Admiral Kato. We should recall that during the London Naval Conference, Okada was a senior naval officer and chief technical representative who participated in the conference. Okada's efforts were largely responsible for the conclusion of the commercial agreement. When Okada returned to the country, Kato was angered by his acceptance of the 5:5:3 ratio, and immediately resigned.</p>
<p>After an all-night meeting, the princes and military councilors decided to declare martial law at four o'clock in the morning. However, it was practically useless, as the rebel soldiers still guarded the official residences, and the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were still unable to resume work. Everything was still under the absolute control of the rebel soldiers, who insisted that their original demands be completely accepted.</p>
<p>The special editions of the newspapers and the special wireless dispatches on Thursday morning still contained very little news. The government ordered the people to remain calm and not to believe rumors. It is said that the reason for the declaration of martial law was partly to maintain public order in Tokyo, and partly to prevent radicals from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. General Kashii has now been appointed to take full responsibility for martial law. Some rebel soldiers had withdrawn from one or two places, but reappeared there in the afternoon. The Nobles Club was also one of the places that had been occupied. The current reality is that Tokyo has increasingly no troops ready to fight the rebel soldiers.</p>

<p>Tokyo - Army Minister Kawashima deeply feels the weight of responsibility for the incident that has occurred. In order to restore the prestige of the national army and promote the true unity and consolidation of the national army, he will recommend a person of both character and insight as the successor to the Army Minister. To guide the national army in this extraordinary period, it must be someone with real strength. He is carefully consulting with Chief of the General Staff Sugiyama and Acting Director-General of Education Nakamura, and listening to the views of various military councilors. He is also seeking the opinions of General Kawai and other important figures, hoping for a comprehensive solution. It is said that the current Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sugiyama, and Military Councilor General Abe are strong candidates to succeed him. (2nd, Dōmei News)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Naval Conference: Britain is Agile, Having Concluded an Agreement with the United States and France, and Now Seeking Separate Agreements with Germany and Russia <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London - Britain has suggested to Germany that in addition to the naval treaty signed by Britain, France, and the United States, a separate Anglo-German naval agreement be concluded. Regarding this matter, German Embassy Counselor Bismarck submitted a response to British Foreign Secretary Eden last Saturday, stating that Germany is prepared to sign a bilateral agreement. According to this agency's reporter, the Anglo-German naval agreement will be based on the principles contained in the British, French, and American naval treaty. In the British, French, and American treaty, there are still some technical details that are unresolved. Once the final agreement is reached, Britain will submit a copy to Germany. If Germany expresses approval of the terms of this agreement, then Britain and Germany can sign the agreement. In addition, after the British, French, and American naval agreement is signed, Britain and Russia should also sign a naval agreement, just as Britain and Germany have done. As for inviting Soviet Russia to participate in the British, French, and American agreement, Britain has never considered it. Up to this point, it has not taken any action with the Soviet Russian government, only informing the Soviet Russian government of the progress of the naval conference. (2nd, Havas News)</p>
<p>London - Recently, Britain proposed that Britain and Germany sign a separate bilateral naval agreement in addition to the future British, French, and American naval treaty. The German ambassador to Britain, Heesch, was instructed by his government to request instructions. According to this agency's reporter, Ambassador Heesch has received instructions from his government, approving this proposal, but with the condition that the construction of warships between 10,000-ton cruisers and 20,000-ton battleships (the tonnage of battleships is a minimum of 20,000 tons) be prohibited. The French delegation, having received instructions from their government yesterday, which provided guidance on the issue of signing the British, French, and American treaty, has decided to discuss the contents of these instructions this morning, and then meet with the British and American delegations to select a date for convening the naval conference to discuss the final terms of the three-nation treaty.

<p>Washington - Chairman Vincent of the House Naval Affairs Committee hinted today that the United States Navy may increase the construction of new battleships. He said that until the results of the London Naval Conference are known, the committee does not want to take any action on the proposal to allow the repair of fourteen warships and the modernization of six warships. If the lifespan of battleships is not extended by the Naval Conference, then the United States is willing to build new ships to replace old ships, rather than repairing or modernizing the old ships.

<p>London - The British Foreign Office today acknowledged that Howland Island, Jarvis Island, and Baker Island in the South Pacific have been occupied by the United States. According to a spokesman for the Foreign Office, it is not very clear to which country these three islands should belong, but we believe that Britain should have the right to occupy them. However, if the United States has formally incorporated them into its own territory, then Britain is not willing to compete with it. These three islands were formerly leased by Britain to an Australian company, but it is reported that they are still uninhabited and undeveloped. (1st, Kokumin News)</p>

<p>Brussels - The House of Representatives' Defense Committee, which previously planned to submit a report on the issue of the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, appointed Committee Member Treppe as the drafter. Treppe has now completed the draft, which states in part that although Germany has not sent national defense forces into the demilitarized zone, there are more than 30,000 police officers stationed in the area, all stationed in military camps and fully armed (the Versailles Treaty only allows a police force of 8,440). In addition, there are various informal military organizations, the number of which is difficult to determine. Members of the forced labor corps serve for six months, and are constantly replaced, so their number is also difficult to ascertain. Finally, Treppe mentioned the issue of Germany attacking Belgium in the event of war, saying that some people are concerned that Germany will pass through the Netherlands to invade Belgium, but the Belgian General Staff has been studying methods of prevention for more than a year. (1st, Havas News) Radek on Hitler in Izvestia</p>
<p>Moscow - Radek discussed Hitler's conversation with a reporter from Le Journal in Izvestia. "The Franco-Soviet pact, regardless of Hitler's threats and the weeping of his representatives in France, was approved by the Chamber of Deputies. The Democratic Republic of France is unwilling to be subdued by Hitler and his representatives in France, but this pact has not yet been approved by the Senate. The opponents of the Franco-Soviet pact will make a final effort to delay the approval of the pact. 'Fischer' personally came forward to compromise with the French right-wing, and began to describe inaccurate facts, saying that when the Ruhr was occupied, he wrote 'My Struggle' in prison." Hitler hopes that his French friends will conceal from the French people the various declarations he made between 1925 and 1932, promising the open letter to Papen on October 21, 1922. In this letter, he called on Germany to secretly expand its armaments as a policy to counter France, relying on this to unite with Britain and Italy to resist France. This was not during the occupation of the Ruhr, but in the autumn of 1932, on the eve of his assumption of power. Hitler advocated Germany uniting with Italy and Britain to resist France. Since Hitler came to power, he has been committed to establishing a German-Italian bloc to resist France, but due to the conflict between Italy and Germany over Austrian policy, and Britain's pursuit of peace, this effort to establish an anti-French bloc has not yet succeeded. Therefore, Hitler had to send his affections to France, while simultaneously attacking the Franco-Polish alliance, wooing France's ally Czechoslovakia, and weakening France's alliance with Yugoslavia, isolating France and causing it to succumb. Hitler vaguely threatened that the Franco-Soviet treaty created a 'new environment', repeatedly reversed himself, slandered the Soviet Union, and warned France to beware of the Soviet Union. Hitler disregards the inevitable trend of international relations. He will have no right to complain. As we have declared, Hitler has no revolutionary ideas in his mind, and no ideas at all, only the ideas of a small shopkeeper. But we must admit that in terms of explosion and disaster, no one can compare with the Hitler regime. His party representatives and we all know this. With his unparalleled crudeness, his remarks to France are like those of Bismarck before Sedan, or Wilhelm II before the First World War. Only those who have lost their minds, lost all their balance, and think that others do not know their actual position can be so unrestrained. We firmly believe that the result of Hitler's remarks will be the opposite of what he expects. In this conversation, Hitler treats France as if it were a defeated country, or a country that must fear him, but the reality is not so. France is not a weak country. It hopes for peace, but does not expect to be bound by others. We can assert that Hitler and his representatives in France will surely understand this in the future. The sooner they realize this, the wider the road to peace will be. History tells us that Caesar and arrogant monarchs also had the same great self-confidence, but when they saw what the Germans call 'the stick over the dog's head', they also humbled themselves. History tells us that there are also those who refuse to yield, but for those suffering from Caesar's mental disorder, history will surely make them conform." (1st, TASS)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Vast US Public Debt <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Washington learned today that after the Treasury Department raised $1,809,000,000 in debt on March 15, the US public debt reached an unprecedented amount of $31,300,000,000. It is reported that the Treasury Department must first issue $1,250,000,000 in new bonds to absorb cash. The bonds will be of two types: one is a 2.75% bond maturing in March 1951, totaling $650,000,000, but the government has the right to redeem it in March 1948; the other is a 1.5% bond maturing in March 1941, totaling $600,000,000. The cash received will be allocated $450,000,000 to pay off short-term debt due on March 16. Therefore, after offsetting the new and old debts, the net new debt is $800,000,000. This amount will be included in the Treasury's cash reserve to be used for relief efforts, rural assistance, and pensions for veterans. It is expected that after the Treasury Department obtains this new debt, plus the revenue from the increased income tax, it can obtain more than $2,000,000,000 in working capital. As for the Treasury bonds of $559,000,000 due on April 15, new bonds will be issued again at that time to raise funds to repay them. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington - The Treasury Department will issue two new public bonds tomorrow, one with a total value of $650 million, with an interest rate of 2.75%, repayable in 12 to 15 years, and the other with a total value of $600 million, with an interest rate of 1.25%, repayable in 5 years. These two public bonds are the largest in terms of amount since the issuance of the Victory Bonds of 1919. After being listed tomorrow, they will bring the national debt to a new record of $31,300,000,000. In addition, in order to recover the public debt due in mid-April, the Treasury Department also plans to issue new public bonds of $558,819,000 with an interest rate of 2.875% to swap for the old debt.

<p>Washington - According to well-informed sources here today, Roosevelt must raise a huge sum of $1,137,000,000 to pay for veterans' allowances and implement the new agricultural bill. As a result, a new manufacturing tax bill may be redrafted. At the same time, the inflationists in both houses, seeing the necessity of this next expenditure, are also greatly active in the hope of redrafting a method for further inflating the currency. The most radical of the currency inflation plans is the rural mortgage refinancing bill proposed by Flansburgh and Langley. Those who support this bill are all trying to draw attention to it before the national conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties are held. Therefore, the issue of currency inflation is something that both the Republican and Democratic parties cannot help but determine their attitude towards. (1st, Kokumin News)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, in order to protect the interests of the flour industry in the Northwestern states, has decided to exercise his power to subsidize the export of flour with 30% of the tariff revenue. According to Wallace, with this subsidy, the Northwestern region can export 333,000 barrels of flour to the Philippines. However, the calculation of this subsidy will be based daily on the difference between the production cost of American flour and the market price of flour in the Philippines. Wallace also said that before 1930, the United States supplied 83% of the total flour consumption in the Philippines, but at present, the sales of American flour in the Philippines have fallen to less than 10%. According to well-informed sources, after the flour export subsidy is implemented, subsidies for the export of general agricultural products may also begin. (1st, Kokumin News)</p>

<p>Geneva – During the Eighteen-Nation Committee meeting this afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated that the British government had reviewed the Experts Committee report. If other countries agree to implement an oil embargo, the British government will support its implementation. (Reuters, 2nd) This morning, British Foreign Secretary Eden held talks with French Foreign Minister Flandin and Minister without Portfolio Pengcou. It is generally understood that they agreed to postpone discussion of increased sanctions against Italy in the League of Nations Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee, to facilitate negotiations and seek a solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Regarding this, the British and French authorities have reached an agreement with the subcommittee chairman, Vasconcelos, so that only the second part of the original agenda (i.e., reviewing the report of the Sanctions Implementation Experts Committee) will be discussed at the subcommittee meeting today, while the first part (i.e., increased sanctions against Italy) will be postponed. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris – The League of Nations Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee is scheduled to meet today. The method of embargoing oil, which is of most general concern, is about to be implemented. According to speculation by the correspondent of the "Little Daily" stationed in Geneva, both the Soviet Union and Romania are currently unwilling to abandon their commercial interests. Therefore, the embargo measure is unlikely to be implemented, as both countries deeply fear that once the embargo is implemented, Italy will inevitably purchase the oil it needs from the United States, and the Italian market will be monopolized by American oil merchants, excluding the two countries. According to well-informed sources, since the oil embargo is impractical, the Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee may seek other ways to compensate, such as prohibiting Italian ships from entering ports belonging to League of Nations member states. Another approach being considered by people in the United Kingdom and Scandinavian countries is to provide financial assistance to the invaded country. "Business Report" states that although Italy is subject to sanctions and goods cannot be exported, the practice of smuggling goods out of the country via Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Hungary has not disappeared. Efforts are now being made to curb this, so that there will be no more smuggling. Geneva believes that if this method is actually implemented, it will increase the effectiveness of the sanctions. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris – After arriving in Geneva this morning, British Foreign Secretary Eden will first hold talks with French Foreign Minister Flandin. According to observations by the diplomatic correspondent of "Business Report", this conversation is the most important event of the current session of the League of Nations Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee, as the two will discuss the following five issues: the possibility of peace between Italy and Ethiopia; what methods can be used to make Germany return to the League of Nations; after the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is approved by the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies, what attitude should the UK and France take if Germany requests a conference of the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty; what attitude should the UK and France take if Germany re-fortifies the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland; and various issues regarding the naval conference.

<p>Geneva – The recent victories of the Italian army in northern Ethiopia are considered important by people at the League of Nations. It is expected that the Italian government will take advantage of this opportunity to initiate diplomatic moves to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. As for the League of Nations Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee, which was originally scheduled to meet today to discuss increased sanctions against Italy, it is now learned that the subcommittee chairman, Vasconcelos, at the request of British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Flandin, has decided to postpone the discussion of increased sanctions against Italy, so that representatives of the countries concerned can determine their attitude and await a clear expression of intent from the Italian government. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome – As the League of Nations Administrative Council is about to meet to discuss increased sanctions against Italy, the Italian government has today prepared to redefine its foreign policy. If the League of Nations expands economic sanctions, Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations and abolish the Locarno Treaty. Reliable sources predict that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will turn to Germany and other countries that do not participate in the sanctions, and will seek to conclude defensive treaties on economic and diplomatic matters to cope with the oil embargo. At the same time, the whole country is ecstatic because General Badoglio won a great victory on the northern front in Ethiopia on the 14th anniversary of the First Battle of Adwa. Today, the Italian King and Mussolini personally led 50,000 Roman residents to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for a solemn military parade. Afterwards, citizens marched through the streets, praising the achievements of the Italian King and Mussolini. Mussolini frequently returned their greetings, even stopping work for nine minutes.

<p>Geneva – As far as our correspondent knows, although Italy's war against Ethiopia is very successful, British Foreign Secretary Eden still supports increased sanctions against Italy and continues to implement the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant. In addition, most representatives agree with the British representative's expression of surprise and displeasure at Italy's large-scale military operations and widespread propaganda of Italian military victories on the eve of the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee.

<h3 id="e40">Italian Commander-in-Chief Announces: Ethiopian Army on the Northern Front Completely Defeated; Ethiopian Emperor Plans a Desperate Last Stand <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Tigre Province Front, Ethiopia – General Badoglio, High Commissioner for East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army, recently told reporters at the General Headquarters, "The Ethiopian army on the northern front has now been completely defeated. This is a joyous event. Its Second Army has been annihilated by our army. In the blink of an eye, its Third Army will also be destroyed. From then on, the Ethiopian army on the northern front can be cleared. At this moment, the remaining enemies, forgetting themselves, disregarding everything, are eager to cross the Geva River and flee back to their hometowns, abandoning all their guns and ammunition along the way, so that those who see them do not recognize them as soldiers, but think they are villagers," etc. According to our correspondent, the troops of Ethiopian Army Minister General Muluguetae and General Gassa, commander-in-chief of the northern front, have retreated after Tombien. Therefore, this battle can be said to have decided the outcome of the war. Moreover, the Tombien area is undulating with hills and rugged terrain, which is a natural barrier, but the Italian army captured it in one fell swoop, which shows that Ethiopia is really difficult to resist under large-scale military operations. Now the morale of the Ethiopian army is low, and the defeated army is scattered and cannot be reorganized. The soldiers have all fled back to their hometowns, and there are no reserve troops to continue fighting. It is said that when the battle of Tombien was about to end, the Ethiopian emperor planned to make a desperate last stand, personally leading the Guards northward from the city of Taixi, hoping to rescue General Muluguetae or attack the rear of the Italian Third Army (which was attacking the troops of General Gassa from the side at that time). However, he failed to arrive in time. When he reached the vicinity of Gualan, he was ambushed by the Italian army and suffered heavy losses, so he had to lead his troops to retreat. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Asmara – According to a dispatch from Holm, special correspondent for Reuters in the central part of the Italian army on the northern front, after suffering the greatest defeat of his life, General Gassa is now leading the remnants to flee southwest. Gassa's 40,000 troops have been divided into several groups and are fleeing in all directions. After Gassa withdrew his troops from Mount Uok on February 28, he attacked again yesterday. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time. The Ethiopian army, feeling surrounded by two Italian columns, desperately tried to break through the Nawo Pass, but was blocked by the Italian army, and then fled in confusion. It is now believed that General Gassa's defeat will have a major impact on the internal situation in Ethiopia, because Gassa is known as the "Elder of Northern Ethiopia" and is wealthier than the Ethiopian King. His prestige is unmatched by any politician in Ethiopia. As for Ethiopian General Siyoum, although he was heard to be stationed in his birthplace of Achia Adti on Friday, his whereabouts are currently unknown. 20,000 Italian troops participated in this battle, with a total of 1,000 killed and wounded. The Ethiopian army killed more than 1,000 people. Chasing the defeated soldiers, which was previously the responsibility of the cavalry, is now carried out by aircraft, which is very effective. (Reuters, 1st) Italian Northern Front Headquarters: After General Badoglio defeated the troops of Ethiopian General Kassa in the northern part of the Tombien area, today the area is full of Ethiopian soldiers killed and wounded. Italian reconnaissance planes report that the Ethiopian Emperor's elite guard is now advancing north, hoping to make a final effort to stop the retreat of the defeated troops of General Kassa and General Siyoum. Today it is learned that the battle of Jinshan initially involved hand-to-hand combat in the dark. The Italian army advanced lightly and forced the Ethiopian army to abandon the defensive area on the top of the mountain. After hours of fierce fighting, the Italian army captured the Ethiopian army's general headquarters. Before retreating, the Ethiopian army also fought bravely. Now General Kassa's troops have retreated to the area where the rebellion is in full swing, and General Siyoum is hidden in a cave in the Tombien area, with only three or four soldiers left.

<h3 id="e44">Banknote Issuance Tax: Expected to No Longer Be Collected <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing – The issue of collecting banknote issuance tax from various banks in the 15th year of the Republic of China is currently under consideration. Because the right of issuance of various banks was terminated when the legal tender was implemented, the reserve guarantee funds for those already issued and in circulation have been handed over to the Central Reserve Guarantee Fund Management Committee for safekeeping. The meaning of collecting the issuance tax was originally to prevent excessive issuance. Now that there is this restriction, it is expected that it will no longer be collected. It is still under study and has not yet been decided. (Special Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Nanjing – According to banking circles, in the past, in order to prevent banks from excessively issuing banknotes and to control the profits obtained by banks from issuing banknotes, the "Banknote Exchange Coupon Issuance Tax Law" was promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the issuance tax was levied. Since the implementation of the new currency policy, the banknotes that each issuing bank had printed but not issued have now been sealed and destroyed. The cash and guarantee reserves that should be paid for the banknotes already issued and circulating in the market have also been taken over by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. Now, except for the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, other banks no longer have the right of issuance, and naturally have no obligation to pay the issuance tax again. Even the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, which have the right of issuance, are now designated by the government as legal tender, and it seems that there is no reason to collect the issuance tax. The issuance tax for the 25th year of the Republic of China must be collected after the start of the fiscal year according to law. The date of collection is still far away. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance will have a clear expression on the issue of collecting the issuance tax around June 7th of this year. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<p>Nanjing – The national silversmith industry previously sent representatives to Nanjing to petition for the amendment of the "Silver Usage Management Rules for Silver Products" in order to maintain the livelihoods of silversmiths.

As for the pure silver used in the rules, which must not exceed 30%, the Ministry has conducted detailed research and ordered the Central Mint to produce various alloy materials for use in handicraft technology, which will not hinder it. Still, it is necessary to follow the previous approved points and earnestly purchase and use them. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar Incident: Overview of Three Types of Taxes; Customs Duties Remain Normal, Salt Tax Reduced, Unified Tax Entirely Falls into Puppet Hands in Eastern Hebei <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Regarding the Hebei-Chahar incident, Doihara, representing the Japanese side, and Tada, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin, initially had divergent opinions and disagreements. After separate activities by Xiao Zhenying and Chen Zhongfu, they gradually moved toward consensus. Xiao Zhenying told people last week that he was very optimistic, saying that the puppet organization in eastern Hebei could be abolished within a week or so, with the only difference being the position of Yin Rugeng after he withdrew from eastern Hebei. Unexpectedly, the Tokyo coup broke out suddenly. Doihara, who belonged to the core of the young military faction, suddenly received a telegram to return home, and it is unlikely that he will come to Pingjin again in a short time. At the same time, Tada did not want to negotiate this matter before the political situation in his own country was settled, so the negotiations were shelved. At this time, the puppet organization in eastern Hebei is still proceeding with everything relentlessly, such as establishing a puppet construction committee, ordering each of the 22 counties in the puppet area to elect one representative to serve as a puppet committee member, and setting up a puppet propaganda agency in Tangshan City, the Eastern Hebei Daily, etc. Judging from the situation, there is no intention to abolish the puppet government. Therefore, there have been renewed rumors in recent days that problems have arisen regarding customs, salt, and unified taxes in the eastern Hebei region. According to inquiries from various parties, the rumors are exaggerated, and the facts have not yet changed significantly. As far as customs duties are concerned, the Tianjin Customs, Qinhuangdao Customs, and the various checkpoints on the Great Wall still collect taxes as before, and submit them to the Pingjin Central Bank in accordance with past procedures, which are then remitted to the Ministry of Finance. There are no obstacles to tax collection at various checkpoints. However, recently, according to the request of the North China authorities, the central government allocates 12 million yuan annually from customs revenue to assist with political expenses. The remaining amount, after deducting the 9 million yuan annually for customs surcharges, debt guarantees, etc., is approximately 20 million to 22 million yuan, which is returned to the central government. This general amount is based on last year's revenue as a distribution benchmark. The funds to assist the Hebei-Chahar authorities are directly allocated by the central government on a monthly basis. The tax revenue from various customs checkpoints has not been intercepted. As for salt taxes, the puppet government of eastern Hebei had previously sent puppet security teams to occupy the Tanggu and Hangu salt beaches, prohibiting the shipment of Changlu salt to other areas, and instead issuing new permits from the puppet finance office to transport Liaoning salt into the war zone for sale. After negotiations, it was resolved that 250,000 yuan would be allocated monthly for the puppet organization's political expenses, and more than 1.2 million yuan would be allocated for the military expenses of the Hebei-Chahar garrison. This matter was implemented in February. After the puppet government agreed, Changlu salt was allowed to be transported and sold as before. The puppet security team withdrew from the salt beaches. Changlu salt in the eastern Hebei region can also be sold. However, recently, the salt tax revenue has been low, with monthly revenue of less than 2 million yuan. After deducting various foreign debt guarantees and public debt repayments, the two assistance funds actually exceed 1.4 million yuan, which is already insufficient, so it is necessary to overdraw to supplement it. However, according to the tax bureau's observations, if the situation is stable, this year's tax revenue can still be maintained at the level of 20 million yuan last year, so there is no need to worry about deficits. As for the unified tax, after the Tangshan Unified Tax Administration was seized by the puppet government of eastern Hebei, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Tianjin Unified Tax Administration to also handle tax collection in other locations. For all goods from Tangshan and other eastern regions, when they pass through the first customs checkpoint on the sea route or the first unified tax inspection station on the land route, they are required to pay the tax. Tangshan's unified tax is mainly composed of coal tax from Kai'ao, cement tax from Qixin, cotton yarn tax from Huaxin Yarn Factory, and flour tax from Decheng Flour Factory, with a monthly revenue of more than 300,000 yuan. At first, the factory directors originally planned to pay taxes according to the old rules, but the puppet government's inspections were very strict. Those who did not pay taxes were not allowed to leave the factory for transport. The factory directors had no choice but to pay taxes according to the puppet regulations. When goods leave the eastern Hebei region, there are inspection stations on the land route and customs checkpoints on the sea route. If the tax is not paid, transport is not allowed. The factory directors believe that paying taxes twice is close to double taxation. Although they have protested, the political situation is such that empty talk and reasoning cannot be eliminated. Therefore, except for the coal tax from Linkuang, which is temporarily recorded on account and not paid to any party, the other factory directors negotiate with both parties. Those who transport and sell goods within the eastern Hebei region pay taxes to the puppet eastern Hebei government, and those who transport and sell goods outside the puppet area pay taxes to the Hebei-Chahar-Shanxi-Suiyuan unified tax agencies. The Japanese side had previously mediated between the two parties, intending to use a compromise method, using the total unified tax revenue of Hebei-Chahar as the standard, dividing it into four shares, with the puppet government of eastern Hebei taking one share and the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council taking three shares. The North China authorities did not find this method very suitable and rejected it, so there is currently no way to reach a compromise. The Tanggu Unified Tax Administration Inspection Station, originally located in Tanggu, was ordered to move to Dagu to work because the area was occupied by the puppet eastern Hebei government. However, the unified tax revenue from Tangshan and other eastern regions is far lower than before, at most 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month, a decrease of seven to eight times compared to the past. Due to the difficult environment, there is nothing to be done but sigh in vain. The unified tax of the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, except for the revenue of Shanxi Province, which is retained for the province's public use, currently collects a total of more than 800,000 yuan in cash per month. The tax revenue from Tangshan has been withheld, and the current revenue is only more than 400,000 yuan. However, it has still been approved by the central government and allocated for Hebei-Chahar political expenses. (29th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Juye County, Shandong Province: The Decayed Mouth of the Retaining Embankment is Blocked; Floodwater is Suddenly Blown Back by the Wind; County Magistrate Takes Advantage of the Situation to Supervise Construction; Disaster Victims in Five Counties Hope to Receive Relief <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Since the Lingfan breach in Juye County, the repair of the Dong and Wang retaining embankments has failed one after another, and the floodwater has inundated almost the entire territory. On February 16, a strong northeast wind blew the floodwater into the Xinhe ditch, and the water level slowly dropped. By 6 p.m., the flow width at the mouth of the retaining embankment was only a few feet, and the water depth was only a foot or so. County Magistrate Qin Daoyu, upon receiving the report, believed that a good opportunity had arrived and immediately sent thousands of police and conscripted laborers to rush to block the breach overnight. The county magistrate also went to the breach in the wind at 10 p.m. to supervise the construction. However, although the water level had dropped, the ditch was quite deep, and the weather was cold and freezing, making it difficult to obtain soil. Moreover, the land before and after the retaining embankment was completely covered with accumulated water, so the work progressed with great difficulty. After ten days, the ditches were completely filled, and hemp bags and reeds were used to protect and consolidate them. A small embankment more than a hundred feet long and more than two feet wide was also built. The construction is still continuing. It is said that the decision has been made to make each new retaining embankment one zhang high and ten zhang thick. After it is completed, the breaches in the Dong and Wang retaining embankments will be repaired, and the work will be completed soon. The river defense will be further consolidated, and the million people in the five counties of Juye, Yuncheng, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu will all rejoice. It is said that the section of the Juye repaired embankment at the blockage point has the best results and was the first to be completed, which is very satisfactory. An order was also issued to the county to reward all personnel involved in the work. In addition to a major merit for the county magistrate, all other personnel involved in the work were also given merit and flags were awarded as encouragement. The Juye County Retaining Embankment, repaired by the people, was breached by accumulated ice on January 18, causing hundreds of villages in the five counties of Juye, Yuncheng, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu, north of Juye and south of Huanghua Temple, to be flooded. The disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold and urgently need relief. Although the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association and the Relief Committee have allocated funds for emergency relief, it is a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. Zhang Rugong, Xia Zhaogin, and five other representatives of the people from the five counties of Juye, Yuncheng, etc., were recently publicly recommended by the disaster victims to come to Jinan to appeal to the provincial government to quickly allocate funds for disaster relief, and to request the central government and various charitable organizations to urgently provide relief to save the people. Their petition states: "A petition regarding the breach of the people's embankment, the severity of the disaster, and the urgent need to allocate funds for relief to save the lives of the people. We have learned that the Juye Retaining Embankment, repaired by the people, was breached by the fierce rise of the river on January 18, causing hundreds of villages in the five counties of Juye, Yuncheng, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu, north of Juye and south of Huanghua Temple, to be flooded along the official embankment. The floodwaters are raging, and houses are collapsing. In this severe cold weather, with biting north winds, men, women, old, and young live in the open air, without enough clothing to keep warm and without enough food to fill their stomachs. They weep day and night, and deaths follow one another. The misery of the situation is unbearable to hear and unbearable to see. If relief is not provided, hundreds of thousands of people will surely starve to death. Your Honor is concerned about the people's suffering and loves the people like children. In past disasters, you have repeatedly provided relief, and the people are grateful for your virtue. Now we have suffered another great calamity, and relief is urgently needed. Therefore, we, the representatives, have crawled out of the mud and come here to appeal to the Chairman to show his grace again. The living and the dead will never forget it. We shed tears and submit this petition, humbly requesting your consideration. Presented to Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government by Zhang Rugong, representative of Juye; Xia Zhaogin, representative of Yuncheng; Li Yantai, representative of Fanxian; Huang Zundian, representative of Shouzhang; and Lei Guangdian, representative of Yanggu."

<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The Henan Gazetteer was started in the seventh year of the Republic of China and has taken eighteen years to compile, costing a total of more than 500,000 yuan. Now, all drafts have been completed, and proofreading can also be completed by the end of March. It is estimated that there are more than ten million words, which are planned to be divided into 500 volumes. The printing period will take at least half a year. The format is based on the Yuanhe Prefectural Gazetteer and the Yuanfeng Jiuyu Gazetteer, but a separate city and county gazetteer is added, describing the provincial capital, the traveling capital, the eleven special commissioner districts, and more than 110 counties, so that those who prepare the provincial gazetteer can avoid having to flip through the gazetteers of each county. The special features of the gazetteer, in addition to detailed descriptions of the province's soil, geology, animals, minerals, plants, clothing, food, and housing, are that the Jinshi Gazetteer is divided into two volumes. The upper volume contains those that have been recorded, and the lower volume of bronzes collects those preserved by the Anyang Antiquities Preservation Society, the Henan Museum, and the collectors Zhou Yang'an in Beiping, Liu Shanzhai in Shanghai, and Wu Yichang and Lin Shi'an in Henan, totaling more than 500 pieces. According to world-renowned works on Chinese ancient bronzes, the most famous are Yunshi's Jijinglu and the Essence of Chinese Ancient Bronzes in Japan, but the former has less than 200 pieces and the latter has less than 300 pieces. This gazetteer will become a great spectacle in the world. Regarding dialects, it first describes the position of the Henan dialect in the Chinese dialect system and its origin, the mixing of ancient Hua and Hu, the reclamation of Hukuang in the Ming Dynasty, and its relationship with the Henan dialect. It then describes the characteristics of the tones and final sounds, dividing the province into ten linguistic regions, including Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Anyang, Linzhang, Wuzhi, Qinyang, Runan, Xinyang, Luoyang, and Shanxian. The compilers of the gazetteer include Chief Editor Hu Shiqing, former source stream Zhang Guogan, official Wu Tingxie, literature Xie Guozhen, Jinshi Liu Jie, household population clan surname Li Taifen, religion Liu Pansui, and others such as Wang Youqiao, Zhang Zhongfu, Jiang Huiwu, etc., all of whom are specialists in their fields.

<h3 id="e83">Fujian Province Establishes Provincial Land Bureau to Manage Land Throughout the Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The provincial government has recently established the Provincial Land Bureau to reorganize land throughout the province, appointing Gao Dengting as the director and He Jingwei as the deputy director. Yao Yonghuang, Fan Hongzhen, Shi Lin, etc. are appointed as section chiefs, He Youzao as accounting director, and Zhao Ju'en as technical director. The remaining staff are filled by original staff from the Land Administration Section of the Department of Civil Affairs and graduates from the Finance Class of the County Administration Personnel Training Institute. It was established on March 1. As for the land reports from various counties, after the provincial government urged them to speed up the process, two-thirds have now been completed. The remaining one-third of the counties have not been completed, either due to financial difficulties or lack of talent, resulting in slow progress. After the establishment of the Land Bureau, it was decided that all counties must complete the process by the end of June this year. Those counties that have already completed the process will continue to conduct land surveying. The provincial government has already telegraphed Minhou and Changle counties to quickly plan and conduct a complete land survey of the county, and to submit the preparation situation and budget for expenses so that personnel can be sent to provide guidance. After receiving the order, the Minhou County Government has appointed Gan Jiaen to be responsible for the planning. It is expected that the surveying can begin in mid-April. The method is to first organize ten small surveying teams, select a certain area, and implement the land registration according to the township, step by step. After the efficiency of the team improves, it will be expanded to sixty small teams, and then a general survey and registration will be carried out. The estimated total cost is 200,000 yuan. The Minhou County Government stated that it will not collect surveying donations from the people for this surveying expense, but those who hide or underreport their land will be punished.

<h3 id="e84">Lianghuai Salt Transport Agency Maintains Wharf and Bengbu Salt Sales, Clearly Stating That Salt From Other Areas is Not Allowed to Encroach on Sales <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Bengbu is a wharf for the sale of Huai salt. All incoming salt must be put into warehouses and sold in turn, which is the so-called rotation system. As time goes by, the costs increase. The salt from Mingguang and Guzhen arrives and is sold immediately, with lower costs. Therefore, it is difficult for the Bengbu salt price to be on par with Mingguang and Guzhen. Last year, a small number of merchants transported salt from Mingguang and Guzhen to sell in Bengbu and the Hebei area, which greatly affected the sale of rotated salt. In order to maintain the Huai salt rotation sales system, the Lianghuai Salt Transport Agency recently telegraphed the Bengbu Salt Affairs Tax Collection Office and Inspection Bureau, ordering that no matter what method of transportation is used, the salt from Guzhen is not allowed to be sold to the south, and the salt from Mingguang is not allowed to be sold to the north. The tax police of the office are responsible for strictly enforcing this. If any salt that violates the regulations is found, it should be deposited in Bengbu and listed after the existing old salt, to be sold in turn, so as to avoid taking advantage of loopholes. All salt that has been taxed but not transported is not allowed to change the designated transport location. After receiving the order, the Tax Collection Office here, in addition to sending letters to the Jiashan and Guzhen Inspection Offices to sell the salt stored in their respective locations and not to issue Northern and Southern transport inspection certificates to encroach on Bengbu sales, also sent letters to the military and police agencies to assist the office's tax police in strictly cracking down on violations in order to maintain rotation sales.

<p>The Xinzhuang Gambling Case is Referred to the Court</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau, on February 24, received a secret report that there were large gambling tables in the Huizhenguan Taoist Temple in Xinzhuang Town, with all kinds of gambling activities, such as Yaoshi 20-Door Pai Gow, and hundreds of gamblers gathered. Outside, Shen opera was performed, ostensibly to raise funds, with tickets priced at one yuan and eight jiao, ostensibly to attract spectators, but in reality to attract gamblers. The bureau sent patrol officers, squad leaders, detectives, and a plainclothes police officer to make arrests. They saw members of the Security Corps guarding the entrance. They arrested four gamblers inside, including Wang Yongfa, Zhu Fangsheng, Chen Yongjin, and Wang Yongsheng, as well as gambling equipment such as the 20-Door Guan Tan Pu. They were detained at the 6th Precinct. Patrol Officer Lu, believing that the ringleader had not been caught, temporarily released the detainees on bail. Director He then sent a superintendent to investigate and confirmed the report. However, the gambling ringleader could not be found. After reporting back to the bureau, he telegraphed Patrol Officer Lu to transfer the detainees and evidence to Songjiang. However, Wang Yongsheng had already fled. The bureau then transferred Wang's guarantor, Guan Jichang, along with the other three detainees and gambling evidence, to Songjiang yesterday. After Director He personally interrogated them, except for the guarantor Guan Jichang, who was ordered to find Wang Bingsheng and send him to the authorities, the remaining detainees were sent to the County Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yue City Discovered Outside Xumen Gate</p>
<p>Jiang Dayi, an archaeologist from Suzhou, discovered an ancient city on November 24 last year in Wangbi, 24th Ward, outside the Xumen Gate of this county. According to the local gazetteer, this is the Yue City built by the King of Yue when he attacked Wu. Zhang Feng and other archaeologists from Shanghai also came to investigate after hearing the news. On the 29th, Wei Juxian came to Suzhou to give a lecture and also saw the city. Wei, who had initiated the Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association with Wu Zhihui and Ye Yuhu, also recognized that the city was of great importance to the historical sites of Wu and Yue.</p>
<p>Farmers From Chefang Town Swarm Into the City</p>
<p>One day, six to seven hundred farmers suddenly came from Chefang Town, Suzhou, and swarmed into the street. All the shops closed their doors. The 6th Precinct of the Public Security Bureau received a report and armed itself to cut off the streets, alleys, and bridges. At the same time, it invited Song and Dong, local figures, and the Baojia chiefs to persuade the farmers not to disrupt the order. At the same time, the 2nd Squad of the 3rd Company of the 7th Security Brigade stationed in Chefang also came out to defend the Hexi area. At that time, the farmers were quite noisy. Patrol Officer Zhou persuaded them that those who owed rent should pay the rent, and that requests for reductions should be discussed at length. The farmers' representatives were satisfied. By 3 p.m., they began to leave the town in a steady stream. The defense of Chefang was not relaxed until the evening.</p>

<p>The Commissioner's Office is Established in One Day</p>
<p>Zang Qifang, the Administrative Inspector of the Wuxi District, arrived in the town the day before yesterday after being appointed. He paid visits to the heads of the provincial departments and offices to ask for instructions. Then, on the evening of the day before yesterday, he arrived in Wuxi with personnel from various departments. At 10 a.m. one day, he established the Commissioner's Office at the Donation and Tax Collection Office on Gongyuan Road and immediately began his duties. He has appointed Hong Sheng as the secretary, Liu Shaoyan as the head of the First Section, Cui De as the head of the Second Section, and Bai Zhujun, the original training officer of the Wuxi District Security Team, as the secretary-general of the Security Command. Wu Delin is the chief of staff. The majority of other administrative personnel have also been appointed. The Wuxi Court is Promoted to a First-Class Court</p>
<p>The Wuxi Local Sub-Court was established in January 1931. After three years, it was changed back to the County Court, handling primary appeal cases from the four counties of Xi, Cheng, Yi, and Piao. Later, with the reform of the judicial system to a three-level, three-trial system, it was changed back to the District Court, expanding the scope of private prosecution. Last month, Wang Yongbin, Minister of Justice, went to various counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line to inspect the judiciary. Because Wuxi is located in an important area, with a mixed population of locals and migrants, and civil and criminal lawsuits are increasing daily, it cannot be compared with other counties. It was decided that at the beginning of this year, it would be promoted to a first-class court at the same time as the Jiangdu District Court, and a prosecutor would be added. It has been internally decided to transfer the current Judge Lu to fill the position, and Prosecutor Shen Zhaoming will be promoted to a regular prosecutor. A chief prosecutor will still be established, with the current Judge Cheng Jun filling the position. Additional judges and clerks will also be appointed to the trial section. In the future, its powers and position will be completely equal to those of the Wuxian District Court.</p>
<p>The Hexutai Gambling Den is Cracked</p>
<p>The Hexutai in Tanhang, outside the North Gate, was originally a famous gambling den.

The day before yesterday evening, Wang Ji, the superintendent of the County Public Security Bureau, secretly sent many patrol officers to search the premises. Ninety-five male and female gamblers and various gambling tools were arrested. After being taken to the bureau, they were all transferred to the court for interrogation on the morning of the one day.</p>

<p>Prevention and Control of Rice Stem Borer in the Third and Fifth Districts</p>
<p>Previously, rice stem borer outbreaks occurred in the third and fifth districts of Jiangdu. Irrigation methods were used to eliminate the pests, and fortunately, a major disaster was averted. Now, Jian Ying has dispatched personnel to collaborate with Jin Yiru, the director of the agricultural extension division, to conduct an on-site investigation. They believe that the root of the rice stem borer has not been completely eradicated and that there is a possibility of future outbreaks. On the 28th, the county government, in order to be cautious, specially invited representatives from the second item of the provincial regulations for the rice stem borer control campaign outline and convened the county party headquarters, extension division, public education center, sericulture improvement district, public security bureau, and district chiefs to form a propaganda committee to implement prevention and control measures. A meeting was scheduled for 2:00 PM on March 7th at the county government to discuss the measures.</p>
<p>Business Tax Bureau to be Reclassified as Second Class</p>
<p>During this spring's Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce meeting in Yangzhou, the Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce reported on the state of commercial decline and requested that the provincial government be informed and that a branch of the Farmers' Bank of China be established in Yangzhou and the business tax rate be reduced to provide relief. It has recently come to light that the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce has received a provincial government order regarding the request to establish a Farmers' Bank branch, stating that it has been ordered to be reviewed by the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank Supervisory Committee. As for the reduction of the business tax rate, it is said that the Finance Department is well aware of the economic difficulties in Yangzhou and will approve the reclassification of the business tax bureau as a second-class bureau, with an annual tax of 75,000 yuan. Jiangdu was originally a first-class bureau with an annual tax of 125,000 yuan. This time, the Finance Department's ability to reduce the tax burden in this way, showing compassion for the hardships of businesses, should be welcomed by the general business community.</p>

<p>County Government Plans to Develop Park</p>
<p>The county government and local figures previously planned to develop a local park, but the project was halted due to the large amount of funding required. It has now been heard that County Magistrate Qi is planning to develop a park. The construction costs are estimated at over 2,000 yuan, which will be allocated from the construction expenses. The plan has been submitted to the provincial government for approval, and construction will begin once approval is obtained.</p>
<p>County Government Requests Further Allocation of Arrears</p>
<p>Due to poor harvests in the past, the county's education funds have been in arrears for more than five months, resulting in teachers' salaries being delayed. Subsequently, the Department of Education instructed that all arrears owed to dismissed and voluntarily retired teachers should be paid from the surplus funds of the 22nd fiscal year. The county government has stated that the surplus funds have been exhausted by the end of the first semester of the 24th fiscal year, and the teachers' arrears have not yet been fully cleared. Continued payments are still required. They have now submitted another document to the Department of Education requesting permission to allocate surplus funds from the 23rd fiscal year for payment.</p>

<p>Police District Consolidation Completed</p>
<p>In order to reduce police expenses, the Public Security Bureau consolidated the five districts into three. The newly appointed head of the First Branch Bureau, Ming Chao Yu, and the head of the Third Branch Bureau, Yang Yin, took office yesterday. The First and Third Branch Bureaus have been consolidated, and the First Branch Bureau has laid off more than ten old and weak police officers. The Second and Fourth Branch Bureaus have been consolidated. The Fourth Branch Bureau has been taken over by personnel sent by Xu Shuzhong, the head of the Second Branch Bureau. A small number of police officers who were left over have been relocated. The old sites of the Third and Fourth Branch Bureaus have been converted into substations.

The two squadron leaders will be transferred to new positions, which will be announced in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Mongolia in the Scramble between Japan and Russia <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>—Translated from A. Grabowsky of Hungary by Bu Ren</p>
<p>Manchuria, which is extremely important in itself, is also a first-class strategic base: this significance is becoming increasingly clear. Manchuria's gateway, the historic road between the mountains and the coast, leads to North China. The Liaodong Peninsula faces Confucius's hometown, the wealthy Shandong Province, across the sea.</p>
<p>Mongolia borders Manchuria. Therefore, the Manchurian problem has raised the Mongolian problem. In recent months, the Japanese have been very active in Mongolia. "Disputes" occur constantly. On the Soviet side, there has been a corresponding reaction. Originally, the Soviet Union regarded Outer Mongolia as its territory and Inner Mongolia as its sphere of influence. According to Moscow dispatches, the Red Army's 16th elite unit is heading to Chita, where it will be stationed, ready to enter the Mongolian border at any time. The demands of "Manchukuo" on Outer Mongolia and Japan's efforts to separate Outer Mongolia from the Soviet sphere of influence have caused deep concern in Moscow's diplomatic circles. The third competitor in this area is China. In 1923, the Soviet Union clearly stated that Outer Mongolia should be an integral part of the Republic of China. Currently, China is no longer mentioned.</p>
<p>It is well known that Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia are different. However, in addition to Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, we can also see a third or even fourth part of Mongolia. The third part is the Soviet state known as Tannu Uriankhai. In September 1921, Russia recognized the independence of Tannu Uriankhai, but in fact it is an important part of the Soviet Union. The entire population of Tannu Uriankhai is only 60,000, and its capital, Khem-Beldyr, is said to have a population of 1,000. Tannu Uriankhai became independent, or rather, Russian-owned, in 1921.</p>
<p>Russia's close relationship with Outer Mongolia began before the Great War. This was the result of the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907. The Anglo-Russian Entente divided the spheres of influence of the two countries in Asia, assigning Outer Mongolia to Russia. From then on, Outer Mongolia and Tannu Uriankhai tended to merge with Siberia. Tannu Uriankhai is the upper reaches of the Yenisey River, surrounded by the Sayan Mountains and the Tannu-Ola Mountains, and isolated from the rest of Mongolia.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the upper reaches of the Selenga River, which flows into Lake Baikal, and the sources of several major streams of the Heilong River are contained within Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Heilong River, one cannot avoid raising the issue of Manchuria again. During the period when Russia was developing its power in Manchuria, especially northern Manchuria, it was impossible for Japan to invade Mongolia. However, currently, Manchuria is virtually subordinate to Japan, and this close relationship is effective. Inner Mongolia is immediately threatened because most of Inner Mongolia, namely the Gobi Plateau, slopes toward Manchuria. The Greater Khingan Range, which is generally regarded as a barrier, is actually just a range of hills with a few high peaks. The occupation of Inner Mongolia by Manchuria predates the Manchurian conquest of China. After the Qing Dynasty gained power in China, the relationship between the Manchurian government and the Inner Mongolian government became even closer. At that time, even Outer Mongolia was included in the Manchurian sphere of influence.</p>
<p>From then on, the main route was from the Chinese capital, Beijing, through the Gobi Desert, to Kulun, and then through Kyakhta to Lake Baikal and Irkutsk. This was the famous trade route. At one time, this was the only route for tea merchants to Europe. Currently, there is a railway between Beijing and Zhangjiakou, and a motor road from Zhangjiakou onwards. However, the road was much busier in the Zamaan era when the caravans were flourishing than it is today. The endless caravans on that historic route have long since disappeared. All this traffic has been replaced by cheap ocean shipping. This change has diminished the world's attention to Mongolia, and Mongolia has gradually shifted from Chinese hands to Russian hands without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>During the Great War, Mongolia attracted attention again. In the so-called "Twenty-One Demands," Japan demanded special rights in eastern Mongolia. At that time, Japan was still an ally of Russia; therefore, it was careful not to mention the entire territory of Mongolia, but only the part adjacent to Manchuria. However, the cession of the entire Mongolia was what Japan really desired.</p>
<p>After the Russian Revolution, Japan immediately took action. Its first step was to gain a foothold in Siberia, and its second step was to collaborate with the White Russians in Mongolia to support Baron Ungern-Sternberg in a move to secede from both China and Russia. Baron Ungern-Sternberg eventually failed, was captured by the Red Russians, and was sentenced to death by firing squad in October 1921. Japan was forced to gradually abandon Siberia due to the united resistance of Britain and Russia. On October 25, 1920, it abandoned its last base, Vladivostok. Nevertheless, Japan's ambitions were not dead; it was waiting for the second opportunity to arrive. During the era of cooperation between Red Russia and "pink China," Japan drew up a counter-offensive plan. It planned to start from Outer Mongolia and deliver a fatal blow to Siberia and the Siberian Railway, cutting off Russia's vital lifeline.</p>
<p>Japan's desire for Outer Mongolia has been intensified by the construction and planning of Soviet railways. The Turkestan-Siberia Railway built by the Soviet Union, connecting Turkestan and Siberia, is closely connected with China in the Almaty area and is awaiting a branch line within China. Until now, China has only one trunk line, starting from Beijing and passing through Hankou to reach Guangzhou, and even the section from Hankou to Guangzhou has not been fully completed. In addition to this straight railway, sooner or later a lateral railway will be added, passing through the old gateway of Dzungaria and reaching the upper reaches of the Yellow River, connecting with the Pinghan Railway line. The lateral route will start from Almaty, and from then on, Almaty will become a traffic city of world importance. After the road is built, it will allow travelers passing through the mainland to China to avoid the roundabout route via Harbin and Fengtian; they can pass through Baku, the Caspian Sea, Turkestan or Central Siberia, directly to the interior of China. Such Sino-Russian contact is bound to have serious consequences. Namely: the Manchurian Railway owned by Japan will be ignored.</p>
<p>The occupation of Outer Mongolia allows the Soviet Union to control the gateway to Dzungaria—the fourth part of Mongolia. The Soviet Union is also planning to build another railway, passing through Outer Mongolia along that historic trade route. On September 20, 1925, the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia signed a contract: the Soviet Union has the right to build a railway from Chita to Kulun, and stipulated that a 66-mile wide zone on each side of the railway as a railway area. Of course, this route will later be extended to Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>It is necessary to clarify a common misconception about the Gobi Desert. The Gobi is not purely barren, nor is it the true desert indicated by the word "desert." Especially the eastern Gobi, blessed by monsoon rains, has a number of grasslands, which are excellent pastures. For this reason, Outer Mongolia may extend its borders into Inner Mongolia deep into the Gobi. The social institutions of Outer Mongolia are changing drastically. The Lama system is about to disappear there, so the population is expanding very rapidly. This result will necessitate the expansion of its territory.</p>
<p>The future development of Mongolia is far beyond what most people can imagine. It has a lot of natural resources. Its strategic and geographical position is very important. Currently, its international situation is changing.</p>

<h3 id="e96">China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Dispatches Plane Yesterday to Supply Foreign Merchant Ships off Dagu Port, Carrying Food Back and Forth Between Tianjin and Dagu Four Times, Dropping Over Three Thousand Pounds of Beef and Bread <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) dispatched a plane yesterday to rescue foreign merchant ships trapped by ice off Dagu Port, dropping a total of over three thousand pounds of bread and beef. The reporter from the China Eastern News Agency wrote the following special report yesterday:</p>
<p>Stranded for Over a Month, Food Supplies Depleted</p>
<p>Due to the severe cold in North China, the Hai River off Dagu Port has frozen over, reaching a thickness of dozens of feet, unprecedented in recent years. This has resulted in dozens of merchant ships being trapped in the ice on the sea surface for over a month. All fuel and food supplies have been depleted.</p>
<p>CNAC Dispatches Plane for Rescue</p>
<p>As the situation was critical, merchants in Tianjin requested the Tianjin Maritime Administration to consult with CNAC to dispatch a plane for rescue. Considering it had an inescapable duty, the company immediately agreed, ordering the Douglas aircraft flying the Shanghai-Pingnan route from Ping to Shanghai yesterday to provide assistance while flying over Tianjin and Dagu.</p>
<p>Dropping Meat and Noodles, Reaching Three Thousand Pounds</p>
<p>After departing from Ping at around 7:00 AM yesterday, the aircraft arrived in Tianjin at 8:00 AM. First, it loaded 600 pounds of beef and noodles in Tianjin and flew to Dagu Port to drop them at the locations where the ships were trapped. Upon returning to Tianjin, a CNAC spokesperson told the China Eastern News Agency reporter yesterday that the aircraft made a total of four round trips between Tianjin and Dagu yesterday, dropping approximately 3,000 pounds of food items, including half-meat noodles.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shanghai Bank Promotes Acceptance Bills, Acceptance Period Limited to 120 Days, Discount Rate Set by the Bank from Time to Time <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>In order to assist industrial and commercial enterprises, the Shanghai Bank is promoting the discounting and acceptance of acceptance bills. It has announced its articles of association and explanations, with the acceptance period limited to 120 days and the discount rate set from time to time. The details are as follows, as handled by the Ministry of Commerce.</p>
<p>Articles of Association for Acceptance Discount of Bills</p>
<p>Article 1: The bank will handle the acceptance and discounting of bills in order to serve society and assist industrial and commercial enterprises. Article 2: Companies and firms that have been issued advance payment letters of credit by the bank or have entered into an acceptance contract with the bank may issue bills payable by the bank within the specified scope and have them accepted by the bank. Article 3: The acceptance handling fee will be determined and charged by the bank according to the face value of the bill. Article 4: The term of a bill accepted by the bank shall be limited to 120 days. Article 5: Any bank acceptance bill or commercial acceptance bill that has been recognized by the bank may be discounted. Article 6: Commercial acceptance bills shall be limited to those arising from genuine goods transactions. Article 7: The discount rate may be determined by the bank at any time. Article 8: If a bill discounted by the bank is not paid upon maturity, the issuer, endorser, acceptor, and guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable. Article 9: The bank may amend these articles of association at any time.</p>
<p>Meaning and Types of Acceptance Bills</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Meaning of Acceptance Bills. Goods transactions can be divided into cash payment, credit account, promissory notes, and bills of exchange. Cash payment and credit account are the most common methods. A promissory note, also known as a term note, is issued by the buyer to the seller to pay by the due date. As for a bill of exchange, it is issued by the seller, requesting the buyer to pay on a certain date. After the buyer acknowledges the bill, he signs it, which is called "acceptance" in the law of negotiable instruments, and is called an acceptance bill. Chapter 2: Types and Generation Methods of Acceptance Bills. Acceptance bills are divided into commercial acceptance bills and bank acceptance bills. (A) "Commercial": Commercial documentary acceptance bills occur in inter-city goods trade, where the seller exports and advances payment, and the buyer entrusts the purchase certificate. Commercial non-documentary acceptance bills occur in local goods trade. (B) "Bank": Occur in inter-city goods trade, where the seller enters into an acceptance contract, and the buyer requests to open an advance payment letter of credit. Occur in local goods, where mortgaged industrial and commercial enterprises enter into an acceptance contract.</p>
<p>Functions Can Revitalize the Market</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Functions of Acceptance Bills. The credit account system has been affected by the contraction of silver outflow, and should be abolished, and replaced by acceptance bills, so that industrial and commercial enterprises can operate on their own, and the market can increase its bargaining chips. It is similar in nature to expanding currency, but without the disadvantages of expanding currency. (A) For the seller: It can make capital turnover more flexible, expand the scope of business, reduce bad debt losses, reduce collection staff, reduce the cost of goods, and clarify internal accounts. (B) For the buyer: It can reduce the cost of goods, make capital turnover more flexible, increase their own credit, and expand the scope of business. (C) For the financial market: It can make capital turnover methods flexible and safe, and the market stable, and can create a situation of controlling the market and reducing interest rates.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Request Exemption from Stamp Tax on Acceptance Bills <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting exemption from stamp tax on commercial acceptance bills. To the Honorable Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, all industries in this city, in view of the economic decline and financial exhaustion, in order to improve the credit account system and activate capital, initiated the implementation of acceptance bills last year to provide relief. However, the matter is still in its initial stage and needs to be promoted. This acceptance bill is a basis for both the seller and the buyer to agree on a payment date in a transaction, which is different from the use of ordinary bills of exchange. Moreover, it is a newly tried negotiable instrument, and it will not damage the original source of stamp tax. As for its circulation in the market and assistance to the economy, it is more effective than the temporarily exempted checks. The Committee for Promoting Acceptance Bills of the affiliated association proposed to petition the government for commercial acceptance bills to be temporarily exempted from stamp duty, following the example of checks, in order to encourage them. It is proposed that the Honorable Ministry examine and approve the petition, and then submit it to the Executive Yuan, stating that it is necessary to encourage the circulation of the acceptance bills, and requesting it to consult the Legislative Yuan to exempt them from stamp duty, following the example of checks, which is a matter of public convenience. Sincerely, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

General Meeting of All Members Held Yesterday to Discuss All Departure Procedures <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Liangguang Industrial Investigation Delegation, organized by the Chinese National Federation of Industries, held a general meeting of all members at 3 PM yesterday, and was successively treated to banquets by Yu Qiaqing and Yang Dezhao. The delegation is scheduled to gather at the New Customs Wharf at 10:30 tonight and board the President Jefferson. The ship will weigh anchor at 3 AM on the 4th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yu and Yang’s Banquets</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the Chinese National Federation of Industries hosted a tea banquet to entertain all members of the delegation and held a general meeting. Over 30 people attended, including Guo Shun, Cai Shengbai, Hu Xiyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Zhisheng, Zhang Huikang, Mao Heyuan, Wu Qingtai, and Pan Yangyao. Qian Chengxu, the chairman, delivered a farewell speech. After the speech, Hu Xiyuan, the deputy head of the delegation, responded. Then, all departure procedures were discussed. After the meeting, they went to the Guang Dong Road Shipping Club to attend a tea party hosted by Yu Qiaqing and took a commemorative photo. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Yang Dezhao at the East Asia Restaurant.</p>
<p>Mr. Qian’s Speech</p>
<p>During the meeting, Chairman Qian Chengxu said in his speech, "Today, the committee of this association is holding a tea party to bid farewell to the Liangguang Industrial Investigation Delegation. We are honored by your presence. This delegation has been initiated and organized by this association for two years. Although there have been several changes in the middle, it has finally achieved success. This is not only a great joy for this association, but also brings to a conclusion the sincere invitation to visit from the authorities in Liangguang. I will now briefly describe the great responsibility and important mission of this delegation, so that all members can thoroughly understand that the purpose of this investigation is to establish genuine connections between the two regions and to achieve economic cooperation between Liangguang and Shanghai. Indeed, the decline of industry and commerce in recent years is due to too little economic contact between ports. For example, the industrial and commercial circles of Liangguang and Shanghai lack communication in terms of personnel, production, and sales, resulting in a phenomenon of isolation. This time, my colleagues are going to visit, and I deeply hope that they can take advantage of this good opportunity to build the foundation for connection and cooperation. In recent years, the economic situation in Liangguang has suffered due to the shrinking scope of overseas businesses of overseas Chinese and the reduction in remittances. We are all suffering from the economic downturn, and there is no way to overcome the difficulties except by engaging in self-preservation. This is the origin of Liangguang's adoption of a policy of self-sufficiency and self-supply, and also the obstacle encountered by the promotion of domestic goods in the Liangguang market. However, this is a temporary phenomenon. As long as both parties thoroughly understand each other, the status of the two regions will in the future be able to adopt a more appropriate system for trade exchanges, so as to seek a balance of trade based on the principles of cooperation and mutual benefit, and to develop the entire national economy. In short, all difficulties and obstacles depend on everyone's efforts to eliminate them."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu’s Response</p>
<p>After the speech, Hu Xiyuan, the deputy head of the delegation, responded. It is heard that Qian Chengge, the director of general affairs of the delegation, gave up this trip because Guo Shun will also go to inspect, and no one will be in charge of the association's affairs. Cheng Shouzhong will replace the position of director of general affairs. Members such as Wu Yunshu and Li Zufan have already departed earlier. All 33 members are scheduled to gather at the New Customs Wharf at 10 o'clock tonight to depart. Yesterday evening, the list of names and cabin numbers were distributed.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s Telegrams to Guangdong and Guangxi</p>
<p>The Chinese National Federation of Industries specially telegraphed the governments of the two Guangdong provinces yesterday. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Chairman Lin of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Chairman Huang of the Guangxi Provincial Government, I send my greetings. The Liangguang Investigation Delegation organized by our association is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the President Jefferson on March 4. We have already telegraphed you about this. There are about 40 members in this delegation. The purpose of this trip is to see the various new constructions in your provinces in recent years, which are progressing rapidly. We have long wanted to visit, but unfortunately we have not had the opportunity. We are fortunate to receive your telegrams and also appreciate the invitations from Commander-in-Chief Chen, Commissioner Zou, Commander-in-Chief Li, and others. In addition to feeling honored, we also want to make some contributions to live up to your concern for industry. We hope you will not hesitate to give us guidance when we arrive. We enclose the list of delegation members and ask you to review it."</p>
<p>Telegrams of Welcome from Zou and Huang</p>
<p>The association received telegrams of welcome from Zou Lu and Huang Xuchu yesterday. They are copied as follows: Zou Lu's telegram said, "To Mr. Qian Chengxu, I respectfully read your letter of the 5th. I express my welcome to the Southwest Industrial Investigation Delegation coming south and specially telegram to urge your arrival." Huang Xuchu's telegram said, "To Committee Member Qian Chengxu, I respectfully read your letter. Industry in our province is backward, and imports exceed exports every year. The only way to remedy this is to increase the production of valuable products in rural areas. What you mentioned in your telegram is the same as what we have always believed. The plan to build an industrial new village, starting with textiles, is well-suited to the environment. Regarding cotton textiles, the provincial government has already established a factory to operate. For the spinning part, the provincial government has restored the construction department to actively promote cotton planting to build a foundation. I am eager to see the whole picture of your proposed method and hope that you will give us instructions when the investigation delegation arrives. Respectfully, Huang Xuchu."</p>

The United States is a pioneer in the republic, and the process of its political and economic development can provide many lessons for our country. This year's customs report shows that trade between the two countries has increased even more than before. The two nations are also both nations that uphold peace and abhor war. Mr. Fei Lai's visit to China will surely be based on his observations and will provide a powerful introduction to the American people regarding the goodwill, economic relations, and joint efforts for peace between the two nations. This is what we hope for. Second, the United States has developed its cultural undertakings the earliest and is recognized as having the most well-organized and largest-scale Associated Press. Mr. Fei Lai's past efforts are worthy of our admiration. China's news industry is still in the stage of gradual improvement. We hope that Mr. Fei Lai will provide guidance based on his rich experience. Boqi respectfully represents the colleagues of this association and offers a toast to Mr. Fei Lai's health."</p>
<p>Mr. Fei's Response</p>
<p>"I feel that I have nothing to say under the grand banquet of the press colleagues in your country today. I only heard what the chairman said, that China and the United States are mostly peace-loving and war-hating. I deeply feel that the responsibility of the press is very important. No matter which country in the world, it should bear this heavy responsibility, that is, to report the news very faithfully based on facts, so that there is mutual understanding between countries and so that the countries of the world are moving towards a state of peace. Our company is very willing to adhere to this purpose, to faithfully report the news from all over the world to all countries in the world, and to promote peace throughout the world. I think the colleagues of your association must also be happy to support it. I offer a toast and wish the Chinese press a bright future."</p>
<h3 id="e104">National Federation of Commerce Cables the Central Government to Change the Silver Management Rules to Avoid Restrictions on the Silver Content to Maintain the Livelihoods of Hundreds of Thousands of Silversmiths <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Shiye She (Industry News) reported that the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating, "Recently, we received a report from the representatives of the national silversmith industry, Ran Xizhang, Fu Shengmao, Cai Jilun, Gu Suming, Zou Jizhi, Xiao Junjian, Xia Zuomin, Xu Guangde, Li Gengnian, Zhan Yufu, Ge Yuanchang, Lu Junqing, Zhang Boxun, Han Jiuhua, Huang Haibo, Wu Junsan, Yu Wenkang, etc., stating, 'Since we received the silver management rules for silver products promulgated by the Ministry of Finance in November last year, limiting the use of chemical silver to 30% when necessary, we have been frightened and do not know what to do. It is generally believed that chemical silver is beneficial for machine manufacturing and cannot be competed with by handcrafts. Even if 30% of pure silver is added, it is still hard and brittle, and cannot withstand hammering. Silversmiths in various provinces have requested the Ministry of Finance to revise the rules and exempt the restrictions on the silver content. However, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly rejected the requests, stating that there is no need to discuss them and has not allowed any changes. The decrees are majestic, and small merchants dare not have any other opinions. However, considering the livelihoods of silversmiths across the country, it is really difficult to bow our heads and wait for death, and it is also closely related to national culture and customs. We dare to risk offense and appeal to your association to clarify the situation. Chemical silver is hard and brittle, which is well known to the Ministry of Finance, so its instructions state, "But if it is heated and hammered, it will not feel difficult." However, even if it can barely be made into a vessel, it must be heated and hammered, and it cannot be exquisite and beautiful, and will eventually be abandoned by society. This company has always used pure silver to manufacture jewelry, but for utensils, 88 silver is used. However, it is already difficult to work with. The reason for doing so is to make the material slightly stronger, not easy to be dented, and to resist imported silver products. It is not something we enjoy doing. Now, if we are forced to use chemical silver and restrict the silver content, then it will be difficult for silversmiths to apply their skills. I am afraid that foreigners who use machines will take this opportunity to compete with machine-made products, flocking here to take away our thousands of years of craftsmanship and cause silversmiths across the country to be eliminated. I hope you will consider that the original intention of this prohibition on silver products is only to prevent the outflow of silver. However, there is no need to worry about the outflow of silver products. Those who dare to defy the law and smuggle goods are only seeking profit. This company never sells unfinished silver materials. The silver utensils and silver ornaments sold must be charged with wages in addition to the value of the silver materials, or even more than the original silver price. How can smugglers profit from this? If you worry that some unscrupulous people in the same industry may secretly sell unfinished silver materials and cause leakage, then the same industry can provide joint guarantees, and the customs can strictly prohibit smuggling, which is enough to choke off smuggling. Why give up eating because of choking, and cut off the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people? The operating difficulties of the same industry in recent years are like frost-covered yellow leaves that fall without shaking. Whether they survive or die, they are left to nature. Now, the government not only does not cultivate them but cuts them down. If these hundreds of thousands of workers become unemployed, I do not know how the government will deal with them. Therefore, we are forced to appeal to you in addition to submitting a petition, asking your association to investigate the facts, grant us assistance, and submit a request to revise the silver management rules to exempt the restrictions on the silver content so that handicrafts can be manufactured to maintain the livelihoods of silversmiths across the country and implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. We submit this urgent appeal with the utmost gratitude." Accordingly, we should telegraph your government to review this matter. We earnestly request that you consider the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of silversmiths and approve the change of the silver management rules. This matter is extremely urgent. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully kowtows. Winter Seal.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Taxpayers Association Asks the Municipal Council to Stop the Electricity Company's Reckless Actions. Suddenly Claiming Damage Two Days After Replacing a Meter. Craftsmen Not Verified, Users Not Responsible for Hard Records. <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She (New Voice News) reports that the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, recently, we received a letter from the Tiechunji Barber Shop at 796 Huade Road, stating that the merchant has been operating the Tiechunji Barber Shop at 796 Huade Road in the Public Concession. On July 2, 1930, they installed an electricity meter from the Shanghai Electricity Company and have been using electric lights for more than five years. On February 17 this year, several workers from the Electricity Company suddenly came to the shop, removed the old meter, and replaced it with a new meter, saying that the code had run out and needed to be replaced, etc. Unexpectedly, after removing the meter, on February 19, they received a letter in English from the Electricity Company, stating that the old meter had been damaged by the shop, each hundred characters must be slowed by sixteen characters, calculated for more than five years, the loss should be 193 yuan, 6 jiao, and 9 fen, and they were ordered to pay it off within 48 hours, or else the power would be cut off, etc. The merchant went to the Electricity Company on Feilun Road and repeatedly pleaded, but there was no room for recovery, and they only agreed to pay in four installments. They had no choice but to raise 50 yuan and go to the Electricity Company in Tilanqiao on February 20 to pay it, on the one hand, to extend the period and prepare a letter to your association, advocating justice and sending someone to verify the truth. The merchant has not damaged anything and cannot bear this unreasonable oppression. We ask you to negotiate according to reason and help the merchant out of the trap." The association checked that the installation of electricity meters for electric light users is strictly controlled by the company, and the sealing is strict to prevent users from stealing electricity. Now, according to the barber shop, the Shanghai Electricity Company removed the old meter and installed a new meter on February 17, and on the 19th of the same month, the company sent a written statement, saying that the old meter was damaged, each hundred characters must be slowed by sixteen percent, and the loss must be calculated from the year the meter was installed, and the barber shop was limited to paying it off within 48 hours. Regarding the so-called loss fee of the company, there are two points that we must ask your bureau to instruct the company to pay attention to. 1. When the craftsman removed the meter, they should have first verified the hard record on the meter. At that time, the craftsman who removed the meter did not declare that the meter's hard record was damaged. 2. It was not until two days after the old meter was taken away that it was said to be damaged. It should be known that the hard record on the meter is intact, and the user is not responsible for other internal damage and slow-running responsibility. Moreover, the meter has been installed for more than five years, and the company is responsible for compensating for the electricity fee that has been running slowly for more than five years, which further proves that the meter was undoubtedly damaged when it was installed five years ago. According to the above, we should write to your bureau and quickly stop the company from acting rashly. All losses suffered by the store should be compensated by it. We address this to the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Captain of the Ruikang Ship Barely Escapes From Dagu to Shanghai. Reports That Various Ships Are Trapped, and the Situation Is Terrible. No Good Solution for Relief, Shipping Companies Lose More Than Ten Million. <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi She (Shanghai Times) reports that the commercial ships trapped outside Dagu Port for more than two months due to ice is an unprecedentedly serious situation in decades. Shipping companies have suffered huge losses, and there is no way to provide relief. Although food has been distributed by plane recently, it is a drop in the bucket and still does not help. Mr. So-and-so, the captain of the Ruikang ship of the Shou Kang Shipping Company in this port, recently escaped and came to Shanghai. According to his report, the situation is extremely miserable. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Escaping to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the report of Mr. So-and-so, the captain of the Ruikang ship, the Ruikang ship has been trapped in Dagu Port by ice for more than a month. He happened to encounter a favorable wind and current a month ago, which blew away the ice surrounding the ship, so he was able to find a way to leave the ship and come to Shanghai to report to the company and ask for assistance as soon as possible. The ships have been stuck on the ice for a long time, and the situation is quite miserable. There is a lack of food and fuel. He also went without food for a week, so his body has not yet recovered. The situation of other ships can also be seen from this. Moreover, the losses are in the millions.</p>
<p>Losses of Tens of Millions</p>
<p>According to news from shipping circles, the Tianjin Navigation Administration has been trying to provide relief since the ships were trapped. However, because the ice is very solid, the icebreaker ships have lost their effectiveness. As for the distribution of food by plane, most of it is lost because it is thrown from the sky. Only half of what is thrown can reach the trapped ships, which may not be enough to satisfy the majority of people. But other than this, there is no other good solution. As for the shipping industry, it is also at a loss and unable to provide assistance. It is estimated that the losses of shipping companies will exceed tens of millions. It is still difficult to predict when the situation will improve.</p>

<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina in November last year, entrusting them to collect exhibits of national goods to be permanently displayed in the original national goods exhibition hall. The association held a national goods exhibition once in November of last year. All the products at that time were borrowed from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce. During the opening of the exhibition, tens of thousands of local overseas Chinese visited it, which was enough to awaken people's hearts and promote national goods. After the exhibition closed, all the exhibits borrowed from Singapore were returned, and the overseas Chinese who had not visited could not help but feel regret. Therefore, in order to reorganize the original national goods exhibition hall, the association specially entrusted the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to collect products. The two associations believed that the association was so enthusiastic about national goods, which was commendable, and that it was their duty to help each other in the same boat, so they dared not lag behind. Because the end of the year was approaching, all industries and businesses were busy wrapping up, and they had no time to prepare. Now that the new year has arrived, they are eager to start. It is heard that a collection office has been established in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the product exhibition hall of the association is responsible for soliciting products.</p>

It has been specially stipulated that in the future, stamp inspectors of the Bureau will wear the Bureau's uniform and carry inspection badges when inspecting stamps. The badges will be issued as soon as possible. The public is urged to pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Retrial of Zhang Xuebin Case Scheduled for Pronouncement; Result: Continued Hearing on the Morning of the 9th <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xuebin, a martial artist who claims to be the authentic successor of the Lingji sect of the Shaolin Temple in Sichuan, was introduced by Shen Huating, who resided at 13 Xinminli, Beierbu Road, in August of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. He entered into a contract with Dahuhua Garden on Haige Road to set up a plum blossom stake platform to compete in martial arts. Shen Huating and Sun Lie acted as guarantors. On October 7th of that year, Zhang Xuebin performed on stage but greatly disappointed the audience. As a result, Feng Yixiang, the manager of Dahuhua Garden, demanded compensation for various losses from Zhang, Shen, and Sun, but to no avail. In January of this year, Feng filed a complaint with the civil division of the Special Second Court, suing the three for compensation of RMB 11,097 in actual losses and repayment of a loan of RMB 1,900. As the defendants could not be reached, the case was concluded after unilateral pleading after public notice was served. Recently, Shen Huating filed a motion stating that he still resided in Shanghai and wished to appear in court to defend himself. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma Shuyi presided over a new hearing in court seven. Defendant Shen Huating appeared in court with his lawyer. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the grounds for the lawsuit and the objects of the request for judgment and presented the contract, the loan receipt, and the bill for various losses. Defendant Shen Huating acknowledged the contract and the loan receipt and defended the claim for damages, stating that the issue of liability must be resolved first. Zhang Xuebin did have skills and had demonstrated them to the plaintiff before the opening. He said that a month of practice was needed to perform for the public. However, Chinese martial artists have always been jealous, and they sabotaged the performance. Zhang Xuebin declared before the competition that he wanted to compete on the stage, but they insisted that Zhang compete off the stage, which was of course impossible. They then considered Zhang to be unskilled and stopped his performance on the second day because Dahuhua Garden did not publish advertisements. Judge Ma then asked the plaintiff's lawyer if anyone had gone on stage to compete with Zhang Xuebin. The plaintiff's lawyer replied that there were martial artists, young and old, from far and wide, who, upon seeing Zhang Xuebin's actions, laughed at him for being a charlatan and swindler, and no one would fight him on the ring. Then, the lawyer was asked about the bill, so he ordered the hearing to be continued on the morning of March 9.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Three Convicts in Private Sale of Counterfeit Coins Scheduled for Pronouncement; Yao Xiaobing and Others Ordered to Be Detained <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yao Xiaobing, a native of Changshu, was suspected of privately selling counterfeit one-yuan coins of the Bank of China. Ma Zhongrong, a Chinese detective of the New Gate Police Station, and detective Xu Zhengting found out about it. They encountered Yao on Chongqing Road and Dagu Road the day before yesterday, posing as customers and asking Yao to buy the counterfeit coins. At the time, it was stated that 100 counterfeit coins would be sold for 26 yuan. The detectives first paid 13 yuan and handed it to Yao, who took the money and left. Shortly after, Yao brought 50 one-yuan counterfeit coins and was arrested by the detectives and taken to the police station. Subsequently, based on his confession, they went to 120 Annajin Road and 18 Jinxiufang, Geluk Road, with detectives from the French Police Station and apprehended two accomplices, Yang Guisheng and Zhu Fusheng. They also seized 35 similar counterfeit coins at Zhu's house and took them all back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, in accordance with Article 196 of the Criminal Law, the three were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court for public prosecution on charges of counterfeiting and circulating currency. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the facts of the case and submitted the counterfeit notes. Defendant Yang Guisheng confessed that he had opened the Republican Teahouse at 453 Miti Neiyin Road in the French Concession. On January 10 of this year, he learned that someone was privately manufacturing these counterfeit coins, so he reported to the Western detectives of the French Police Station. The detectives arrested a number of suspects and seized a large number of counterfeit coins. He then picked up 100 of the counterfeit coins and took them back to the teahouse. One day, he showed them to the public and was seen by Yao Xiaobing and Zhu Fusheng. Zhu was a carpenter foreman who often came to his teahouse for tea, so he knew him. The day before yesterday, Zhu came to his teahouse to take the counterfeit notes, saying that he could take them to the countryside for gambling. He gave them all to Zhu because he thought they were useless to keep, totaling 85. The remaining 15 were discarded by his children. Later, Zhu handed over 11 yuan, which he received. Zhu Fusheng confessed that Yao Xiaobing had the idea of selling the counterfeit notes and asked him to fetch them from Yang Guisheng's place. At the time, Yao handed him 11 yuan to give to Yang, etc. When questioned, Yao Xiaobing confessed that he received 13 yuan from the detectives and handed 11 yuan to Zhu without denying it. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confessions and ordered the three defendants to be detained and await sentencing on Wednesday of this week.</p>

<p>Chinese detectives from the Public Concession Police Station arrested Wei Haichen, a person using counterfeit nickel coins, on Xiaoshadu Road a few days ago. They also raided a manufacturing facility at 6 Kangdi Road in the French Concession and arrested two accomplices, Zhang Yuxiang and Zhang Baoshan, and escorted them together to the First Special Court for trial. After verifying the evidence, Wei Haichen was sentenced to five years in prison. As the crimes of the two Zhangs occurred in the French Concession, they were transferred to the Second Special Court for trial. Yesterday, the French Police Station escorted the two Zhangs and the seized counterfeit nickel coin gypsum models to the court and requested a postponement. Judge Li Changnian questioned them once and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the morning of the 9th. The two defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Zhang Yuefang (i.e., Zhou Zhang), the wife of farmer Zhou Miaogen from Qujiaqiao, Caohejing, in the southwest countryside, was recently seduced by Zhou Weisheng, a cousin who is now serving as a local security officer, and instigated to abscond and be taken as a concubine. She was subsequently discovered by Gu Cha and brought back. However, Zhou Weisheng, passionate about the adulterous affair, returned to Zhou Miaogen's house and took her back to his house. Zhou Miaogen, seeing this and feeling anxious, rushed to Zhou Weisheng's house to reason with him. Unexpectedly, Zhou Weisheng falsely reported a robbery to the police station, causing Zhou Miaogen to be detained. Fortunately, the crowd proved it to the police station, and Zhou Miaogen was spared from being framed. Zhou Weisheng, knowing that he was wrong, asked Zhang, the chairman of the board of trustees, to mediate, offering to settle the matter for 200 yuan. Zhou Miaogen, feeling humiliated for life, refused and reported the situation to the prosecutor's office of the local court, which detained Zhou Weisheng and Zhang Yuefang for investigation and prosecution. After the debate was concluded, Judge Lu Hongyi opened the court at 10:00 AM yesterday to pronounce the verdict, sentencing Zhou Weisheng and Zhang Yuefang to three months in prison for adultery. After the judgment, they were ordered to be remanded in custody separately.</p>

<p>Huadong News Agency reports that the small local newspaper Jin Gang Tie Bao published the martial arts novel "Iron Blood Love Silk" by the famous novelist Zhang Henshui in the 21st year of the Republic of China. Later, the newspaper printed it into a single volume to meet the needs of readers. Cui Dingming, the owner of Samsung Bookstore, learned about this and asked Shi Jiqun, the manager of the newspaper, to negotiate and voluntarily sign a contract to wholesale the book. Shi also expressed his willingness. Therefore, the contract was signed on December 1, 22nd year of the Republic of China. The contract stipulated that at least 2,000 copies should be wholesaled each year. Unexpectedly, after the contract was signed, 900 yuan was owed for the books, and Cui did not fulfill many of the terms stipulated in the contract. Furthermore, Cui's business failed, and after the bookstore closed, he disappeared without a trace. Shi was bound by the contract and has not been able to reprint the book until now. He then hired lawyer Jiang Zongpan to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. Judge Cao Jun granted the public service. After several hearings, the verdict was pronounced the other day. The defendant, Cui Dingming, should clear the book payment of 900 yuan, and the contract between the two parties was allowed to be terminated. The litigation fee was borne by the defendant. It is heard that after Shi received the verdict, he re-printed the book "Iron Blood Love Silk" because Zhang Henshui's novels have always been popular with the public and is preparing to distribute it directly to meet the needs of readers.</p>

<p>A local man named Yao Guixiang, 38 years old, residing at No. [無號] in Lane 319, Zhoushan Road, used to be a blacksmith. His residence was next to the private garden of Gan Chixian, a compradore at the Gonghexiang Wharf. The garden owner, fearing that the recent cold weather would hinder the growth of his plants, had installed hotbeds to ward off the cold. On the afternoon of the previous day, the hotbeds suddenly caught fire, with fierce smoke billowing out. Yao, noticing this from outside the garden, quickly reported the fire. Subsequently, the Huishan Patrol Station dispatched Chinese detective Zhao Yongqing and others, along with the fire brigade, who arrived in vehicles to extinguish the fire. The fire was soon put out. During the firefighting efforts, Yao also followed the detectives into the garden near the fire's origin to observe. Unexpectedly, fearing that the fire would spread to his own house, Yao became extremely frightened. While conversing with the detectives, he suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness. The detectives summoned an ambulance, which rushed him to Tongren Hospital, but to no avail. He died shortly after. His body was transported to the Philan Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to the statement of Western patrolman Phillips, Prosecutor Zhang determined that the deceased, Yao Guixiang, male, had died from a shock-induced illness.

<p>At approximately 8:50 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 16, Hongfa Lane, Binxing Road West, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, the residence of a Mr. Yin, who works as a broker for an insurance company. At the time, neighboring residents, fearing the fire would spread due to the closely packed houses in the lane, hastily evacuated with their valuables, supporting the elderly and carrying the young. However, the narrow entrance to the lane caused chaos and panic, leaving the fire unattended. Before long, the fire breached the roof and spread to the neighboring buildings at No. 15 and No. 14. Flames soared and lit up the sky. Fortunately, the site was close to the fourth fire brigade of Zhabei, which dispatched fire trucks immediately upon receiving the news. Police officers were also sent by the local police station to maintain order. The order was slightly restored. The firefighters were then able to work to extinguish the fire. It was extinguished around 10:30 PM, but all three buildings had been completely destroyed. Fortunately, there were no injuries, which was considered a great relief amidst the misfortune.

<p>Shi Yizhang, a Ningbo native currently residing at No. 3, Zhaoyuan Lane, Beishan Road, is 54 years old this year and recently unemployed. His wife passed away long ago, leaving behind a daughter named Shandi, who is 17 years old this year. Years ago, through a matchmaker, she was betrothed to Zhu Xiaocheng, also from their hometown, who is 30 years old this year. A betrothal gift of 200 yuan was given. Zhu works as a chief steward on a foreign steamship and returns to Shanghai every three to six months. When Shandi was 11 years old, her mother passed away, and her father was away on business, leaving her without care. Moreover, her future in-laws had also passed away. That year, Shandi went to live with her fiance Zhu Xiaocheng's aunt and uncle, surnamed Feng, at No. 20, Puqing Lane, Malang Road, in the French Concession. She has lived there for six years, maintaining a good relationship with her aunt and uncle. Recently, she had been looking forward to Zhu Xiaocheng's return to Shanghai for their wedding. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, Zhu Xiaocheng encountered difficulties making a living overseas and was unable to return to marry. He sent a letter in the form of a poem to his aunt and uncle and his fiancee Shi Shandi, stating that he was too poor to complete the marriage, urging Shandi to marry someone else, and willing to forfeit the previously sent betrothal gift. Upon learning this, Shi Shandi, feeling that she had no face to face the world due to Zhu's rejection, sought to end her life. On the morning of the 29th of last month at 10:00 AM, she went out to buy new shoes and raw opium and returned home. At 8:00 PM that evening, she secretly ingested the raw opium and committed suicide. An hour later, her aunt, Feng Wangshi (45 years old, Ningbo native), discovered her and immediately rushed her to Ximen Obstetrics Hospital at No. 393, Malang Road, for treatment. After resuscitation efforts until 8:00 AM the next morning (the 1st of this month), there was still no sign of recovery. She was then transferred to Renji Hospital, but due to severe poisoning, she could not be saved. At 2:10 PM on the 1st, her life was extinguished. The hospital reported the case to the French Concession police, who dispatched Detective Zhang Chunsheng to investigate the cause of death. The body was transported to Tongren Fuyuantang morgue for examination. Yesterday, Wang Ren, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, along with forensic doctors and clerks, arrived at the morgue at noon to confirm that Zhu Shi Shandi had died from poisoning. The prosecutor questioned Shi Yizhang, the deceased's father, and Feng Wangshi, the deceased's aunt and uncle. He then ordered that the body be handed over to the deceased's father after signing a guarantee for its burial. Zhu Xiaocheng, the deceased's fiance, is currently overseas and is unaware that his letter of rejection has turned into a death warrant, causing his fiancee to commit suicide in grief. The poem that Zhu sent to the girl and her aunt and uncle is recorded below:</p>
<p>Writing this poem, my heart is filled with tears,</p>
<p>I resent my incompetence, whom else to blame?</p>
<p>Sending this letter to sever ties with my fiancee,</p>
<p>Entrusting her to find another to marry.</p>
<p>The Zhu family's fate is truly bitter,</p>
<p>Our little girl has grown up and is ready to be wed.</p>
<p>The two hundred yuan dowry is nowhere to be found,</p>
<p>These words will enrage the poor and lowly.</p>
<p>I am too old to start a family and make a living,</p>
<p>Shame prevents me from facing my aunt and uncle.</p>
<p>Although the adults may be willing to help,</p>
<p>I fear being ridiculed by others.</p>
<p>This departure will be forever, with little chance of return,</p>
<p>Life and death, survival and demise, are all uncertain.</p>
<p>If we cannot meet in this life,</p>
<p>Perhaps we will be husband and wife in the next.</p>

<p>Lawyer Yang Shaopeng was reported to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for soliciting bribes under false pretenses. The ministry ordered the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office to arrest and interrogate Yang. Meanwhile, Zheng Yue, the chief prosecutor of the Second High Court Branch, was secretly ordered to conduct a thorough investigation nearby. He obtained some clues and submitted a report. It was found that Yang Shaopeng and Tan Zhuohong, a judge of the criminal division of the Shanghai District Court, were jointly involved in the bribery case. Considering that the case involved an incumbent judge and undermined judicial dignity, the ministry deemed it necessary to investigate thoroughly to maintain official integrity. Therefore, it ordered Zhong Shangbin, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, to detain Tan Zhuohong and transfer him, along with Yang Shaopeng, who was already in custody, to the Suzhou Wuxian District Court for interrogation. It is now learned that the case has been presented by Prosecutor Lu Wenqin of the Wuxian District Court for detailed interrogation.

<h3 id="e138">New Buddhist Organization: World Red "Buddha" Swastika Society; Gathering Monks and Nuns Worldwide to Carry Out Relief and Rescue Work <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The number of Buddhist monks and nuns in China has not been accurately counted in recent years, but it is estimated to be around four to five hundred thousand. Due to old customs, they lack social organization. Although the Chinese Buddhist Association has been established in recent years, it has not yet been fully organized in terms of rectifying monastic rules. Therefore, it has no time to attend social causes and civilian services. Recently, Venerable Hongming, recognizing the above situation and the imminent global crisis, and adhering to the Buddhist principles of compassion and saving the world, believes that Buddhists should also do their part for humanity. Therefore, he initiated the organization of the "World Red 'Buddha' Swastika Society," equivalent to the Red Cross and Red Swastika Society, to gather the strength of monks and nuns to train in medical rescue work. In peacetime, they will piously recite sutras and pray for peace. Once war breaks out, they will go to the front lines, regardless of friend or foe, to carry out rescue, burial, and assistance to refugees in war zones. Since its inception, Venerable Hongming has been traveling between Beijing and Shanghai and has gained the sympathy of the public. Among the central authorities who have signed their support are Central Committee members Bai Wenwei, Kexing'e, Dai Jitao, Peng Yangguang, Yao Yuping, Yu Youren, Cheng Qian, Zhou Bomin, and others. Prominent figures in society include Wang Yiting, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhao Hengti, Tang Xiangming, Wen Lanting, Zhang Xiaolin, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, Zhong Kanghou, Yao Minghui, and Zhu Shiseng. Among the monks, Venerable Yuanying, Taixu, Dehao, Hongsan, Dabei, Yingzhao, and Ruisheng are among those who have joined as initiators. Dozens of others, including Xinci, Changxing, Miaoxing, Youlin, and Wansong, have also joined. Currently, Hongming came to Shanghai a few days ago to participate in the public banquet of various charitable organizations honoring Mr. Xu Jingren and is in contact with the Chinese Buddhist Association regarding all matters. He is scheduled to go to Beijing the day after tomorrow to personally meet with Chairman Lin and President Jiang to report everything and then return to Shanghai to convene a meeting to prepare for the organization.</p>

<p>The quota of 100 couples for the city's seventh group wedding has long been filled. However, some outsiders who are unaware of the deadline are still applying to the bureau for registration.

<p>On the afternoon of the 15th of last month, around 1:00 PM, Wang Guangqi, Hua Youshan, and Hu Guangrong, Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Patrol Station, learned that a large number of thieves had crossed the river from the Chinese-controlled area of Beihang and gathered at the entrance of the Yong'an Cotton Mill on Maigen Road, plotting to rob residents' property. They coordinated with Western detectives and secretly arrested Tao Yubo, Ding Chengjun, Zhang Shaonan, Chen Guifang, Liu Deyu, Chen Hongshun, Xu Tiancheng, all from Jiangbei, and Wu Pengnian, Feng Sida, and a woman named Wang Zhou, all accomplices, at No. 16, Huade Road.

<h3 id="e145">Shanghai County: Extension of Deadline for Clearing Unclaimed Land and Registering Land <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government now announces that the matter of clearing unclaimed private land, supplementing grain, and upgrading the tax classification is crucial for rectifying tax quotas and consolidating property rights for the people. However, the deadline for waiving the supplementary grain fees is approaching, and the number of people reporting and registering is very few. The reason is that land registration is currently being carried out in the county. Those who have land without grain or more land than grain often believe that since they have already registered, they do not need to report and upgrade the tax classification to avoid paying grain taxes at present. If the land and grain do not match, even if they register, they are still privately occupying land without grain until the land tax is collected according to the registered area. For thorough consideration, a report has been submitted to the Finance Department to extend the deadline for waiving the supplementary grain fees to March 15th. Therefore, in addition to making a public announcement, the county government has ordered the district chiefs to urge the township chiefs to explain to the people that those who have land without grain or more land than grain must report and register before March 15th. After the deadline at the end of June, the land will be confiscated if discovered.</p>

<h3 id="e150">The Shanghai Film Industry: Important Statement from the National Salvation Association; Activities Halted Due to Fear of Misunderstandings; Another Chinese Film Industry Association to be Organized <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Film Industry National Salvation Association issued an important statement yesterday, saying: "Recently, the strong neighbor has been encroaching on North China, and the national crisis is becoming more serious. All sectors of Shanghai have risen up to organize national salvation groups. As citizens of China, we are not to be outdone in loving our country. Therefore, on January 27th of this year, we organized the Shanghai Film Industry National Salvation Association to engage in the national salvation movement. The motive is very simple. However, the allegory issued at the time of establishment included the proposition of 'abolishing the current film censorship system,' which seems to cause suspicion. In fact, our film industry is under the control of foreigners, and patriotic films are often unable to be screened in the concession theaters. The above expression is just a cry of this kind of pain, and there is absolutely no dissatisfaction with the central government's film censorship system. Previously, we saw the Central Propaganda Department's letter to the people of the country, showing the central government's determination to 'seek national self-reliance and self-strengthening internally, and seek national independence and equality externally' to the people of the country. We are deeply moved. However, regarding the establishment of our association, there are many accusations. We ourselves consider that the original intention of organizing the National Salvation Association is no different from the central government's intention. If it causes misunderstandings, it is not what we expected. After discussion, the association has now stopped its activities. The comrades of various companies will organize the Chinese Film Industry Association to follow the central government's intention of serving the country and the people and strive for the revitalization of the Chinese nation under its guidance. This is what we all share."</p>

<p>At around 10 AM yesterday, Chen Rongnian, a detective from the Susong Third Police Section of the North Railway Station, saw a young, beautiful girl in fancy clothes carrying a bag of clothes downstairs. She looked frightened and was wandering around. Sensing something was wrong, he questioned her. She hesitated in her reply, so he took her to the section for investigation. According to her confession, her name is Li Wenyin (her name in the brothel is "Ninth Sister," fourteen years old), a farm girl from Daxin Bridge, West Gate, Changzhou. At the beginning of last month, she was lured to Shanghai by a man surnamed Wang. Two women sold her to a prostitute in a brothel at No. 102 Yiduoa Road. Because the owner forced her to learn to sing Peking opera, she could not learn it in a hurry, which led to her being beaten and abused. Thinking that she was still chaste, she took advantage of their unpreparedness, took some clothes, and escaped from the station this morning. The section, knowing that Shanghai is a den of all evils and that Li Wenyin's encounter was pitiful, immediately prepared an official letter and sent a police officer to send her back to her hometown of Changzhou. Her family was asked to claim her.</p>

<p>Since the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road disclosed the news of soliciting members for the North China tour group in this newspaper a few days ago, dozens of people have gone to the company to inquire and participate every day. It is heard that the application deadline is the 11th, in order to prepare for the comfort of tourists' food and accommodation along the way. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 14th and return to Shanghai on the 26th. Although the solar term is slightly late this year, it is feared that the weather will still be cold at that time. It is known that the terrain in northern China is high and the dust blows in the face, which is often considered a hardship by travelers. Only during the period from late February to early March of the lunar calendar, when the sun is shining and the wind is gentle, and the dust is not flying, is why the company chose to depart on the 14th. In the short journey, you can travel to the Confucius Temple, Mount Tai, Beijing, and the Great Wall. You can almost visit all the famous places in North China. Anyone who is interested in making a spring trip should not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Rent Reduction Dispute in Yongyu Lane: The Court Rules a 10% Rent Reduction <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>There are more than 170 houses in Yongyu Lane on Ximen Road, Beile Road, French Concession. The tenants, due to the impact of the sluggish market and the high rent, could not afford it. Therefore, last year, they jointly initiated and organized the Yongyu Lane Branch of the Fourth District Sub-Association of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' United Association, asking the owner, Shunji Company, to reduce the rent in order to maintain it. Unexpectedly, the owner resolutely refused to oppose the tenants' request. Sun Shengchang, a member of the branch, was sued by the No. 2 Special Court for owing rent and moving out, and a provisional attachment was implemented. Fortunately, the tenant had deposited the rent in the bank and was not seized. Therefore, he immediately hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to file a counterclaim for rent reduction according to law, and all the members participated in the lawsuit. After several trials by the No. 2 Special Court, a judgment was made a few days ago, reducing the rent by 10% from August 24 to July 28. The judgment has been received yesterday. It is learned that the branch has convened a meeting yesterday to discuss, in order to seek fair treatment and to resolve the entire issue, because the original rent of the lane varies, with lane houses ranging from 36 to 50 yuan, and city houses ranging from 24 to 30 yuan. It was resolved to pay the rent in accordance with the rent reduction amount determined by the court, and a letter will be sent to the owner to implement it.</p>

<p>Zili Arts and Crafts Society's New Product: Julijiao Glue: The glue is an essential raw material for industry. The glue used in industry is best animal glue. However, its disadvantage is that it needs to be dissolved in water when used, and it loses its viscosity if the temperature is too high, and it will solidify slightly cold, and it is easy to send off in summer. Shanghai Zili Arts and Crafts Society uses chemical methods and domestic raw materials to produce "Julijiao" glue. The viscosity is greater than ordinary animal glue, and it does not freeze even below the freezing point. It does not rot in summer and has a fragrant smell and clean color. Whether it is wood, stone, glass, bone, horn, ivory, or bakelite, it can be glued. There is no need to boil it when using it, and there is no harm in returning to tide after it is dry and solid. Its properties combine the strengths of Arabic gum. At a time when the price of gum is rising, this glue can be used as a substitute for its products, and it is also a new contribution in the national product voice. Anyone who wants to try it can send a letter to Zili Arts and Crafts Su Society, No. 1 Sida Lane, Shikota Road, Shanghai to take samples.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Educational Film Association Promotes Instructional Films, Starting with Schools Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Wuhu, and Huainan Railways <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, educational authorities in various countries have utilized educational films as auxiliary teaching tools, and their effectiveness has become increasingly apparent. The International Educational Film Association has requested teachers at all levels of schools in various countries to dedicate their time and energy to beneficial efforts in instructional films, organizing "Educational Film Pioneers." Schools in various countries have actively responded. According to experiments conducted by many renowned American professors and companies producing educational films using instructional films, the conclusions reached include: Students using films acquire 19% more knowledge than those not using films; students of average ability using films achieve the same level of learning as high-achieving students without films; teachers of various subjects praise the effectiveness of films; they can enhance creativity and increase participation in design work and self-directed activities; and the benefits of acquiring knowledge difficult to obtain through life experiences using films are countless. The Chinese Educational Film Association, to promote experimental film teaching and enhance the efficiency of film instruction, has specially selected twenty reels each of physics, chemistry, and biology films suitable for middle school students. It plans to send personnel to each school adopting instructional films three times in both spring and autumn semesters, allowing physics students to watch physics films, chemistry students to watch chemistry films, and biology students to watch biology films. Teachers of the respective subjects at each school will provide explanations alongside the films. The promotion area is temporarily limited to public and private middle schools along the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Wuhu, and Huainan railways, with gradual expansion planned for the future. The fees for each period are quite reasonable and can be paid in installments. The association has sent letters to schools along the four railways to discuss this matter and has also requested the educational bureaus of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai to inform their respective schools about adoption. It is anticipated that this new educational facility will greatly benefit school education. The association's promotion guidelines and film list are provided below.</p>
<p>Promotion Guidelines: Chinese Educational Film Association Promotion Guidelines for Instructional Films. To promote instructional films and experiment with film education, the association will temporarily select twenty reels each of physics, chemistry, and biology films suitable for middle school students, and conduct traveling screenings. For each instructional film mentioned above, the association will pre-print instruction manuals. The promotion area is temporarily limited to middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools along the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Wuhu, and Huainan railways. Each semester, the association will send personnel to each school for three screenings, with each screening showing two or four reels of physics, chemistry, and biology films (lasting approximately sixty minutes) for students to view. For each subject's instructional films, the teachers of that subject at each school will refer to the instruction manual to create their own teaching plans and provide detailed explanations during the screenings. Each school may participate in any one, two, or all three subjects. The fee standards are as follows: (1) Participating in one subject costs 30 yuan per semester; (2) two subjects cost 50 yuan; (3) three subjects cost 60 yuan. The aforementioned fees may be paid in installments or in one lump sum. Each school must provide black cloth curtains to block sunlight for the screening venue. The association will provide the screen, projector, and other equipment. The association will pre-arrange the screening schedule for each school and notify them one week in advance, along with the instruction manual. Schools must not make any changes to avoid delaying screenings at other schools. The schools are not obligated to provide meals and accommodation for the association's projectionist, but in special circumstances, they may be requested to assist.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Tai Shuangqiu Performs Yesterday: Popular Education Cart. Reports on Invention Process and Function. Ministry of Education Orders Nationwide Adoption. <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Tai Shuangqiu, Doctor of Education from Columbia University and current Dean of the School of Education at Great China University in Shanghai, has been engaged in rural education for years, advocating for people's livelihood-based education, which has attracted considerable attention from the national education community. Dr. Tai, recognizing that current education is costly and its content is biased towards imparting literacy, serving as a decoration for a small number of elite classes, making it difficult to effectively popularize among the general public, invented a "Popular Education Cart" after years of experimentation to address this issue. This invention was previously publicly demonstrated by Dr. Tai in Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces, earning praise from the education community. Recently, the Ministry of Education reviewed and deemed it ingeniously constructed, easy to carry, and a valuable tool for promoting compulsory education and popular education. It has ordered compulsory education and popular education institutions nationwide to adopt it. Mr. Tai hosted a reception for newspaper reporters at Yizhixiang last night at 7 PM, first explaining the function and structure of the Popular Education Cart for popularizing education, and then holding a demonstration. All attendees praised it, and the event concluded at 9:30 PM. The structure, function, and features of the cart are described separately below. Photo of Tai Shuangqiu and his invented Popular Education Cart (International Press Photo).</p>
<p>Structure: The Popular Education Cart's external appearance is a rectangular wooden box, about one meter long, thirty centimeters wide, and seventy centimeters high. It has three wheels at the bottom, one large wheel in front and two small wheels in the back, allowing it to be pushed to various locations. The front and back panels of the cart can be flipped up to serve as a blackboard, and when laid flat, they become a table one meter wide and two meters long, suitable for displays, exhibitions, ping pong, and various activities. There are two types of iron frames on the cart, usually stored inside the cart, and when used, they can be taken out to form a canopy frame for hanging blackboards, charts, oil lamps, books, abacuses, and other items. A cloth curtain can also be attached to the cart. The cart frame and edges have measuring scales for body and fabric measurements. Inside the cart, there are six versatile Popular Education Boxes, storing various supplies for health education, entertainment, crafts, and agricultural product exhibitions. When needed, one box can be selected based on the occasion and carried on the back, without hindering travel over mountains and streams. The cart also has four folding educational stools, two of which combine to form the cart's top cover, while the other two are stored inside the cart, taking up very little space when folded and providing seating for eight people when unfolded, with sturdy connections to prevent tipping.</p>
<p>Function: The Popular Education Cart has an ingenious structure and can fully utilize all its parts. Its main uses include a traveling library, mobile lecture hall, popular newspaper office, mobile exhibition hall, substitute meeting place, commoner's desk, temporary hospital, cooperative store, simple workshop, agricultural guidance, entertainment venue, and open-air tea garden, covering all aspects of education, including literacy, civics, health, livelihood, and leisure.</p>
<p>Features: The cart's features can be summarized in four words: affordable and versatile. The cart has all the above functions, which ordinary educational institutions, such as schools and popular education centers, cannot provide. Even if they could, they would require large buildings, extensive equipment, and numerous personnel, costing thousands of dollars. The value of the Popular Education Cart, including the cart body, frame, educational stools, educational boxes, and over two hundred pieces of equipment and supplies for literacy, health, leisure, cooperation, civics, and livelihood education, totals only eighty-some yuan. The administrator requires only one person, making the cost savings evident. This is its first feature. Popular education institutions have fixed locations, and only a small number of people benefit from them. However, many people lack educational opportunities due to their professions, inconvenient transportation, or traditional ideas. The education efficiency is reduced as a result. Now, the education cart can be pushed to various places, from mountaintops to watersides, to remote villages, reaching all places. It travels to various locations throughout the day and provides education in rotation. One cart can reach hundreds of people, and the equipment can be fully utilized without waste. This is its second feature. Combining these two points, the greatness of the education cart and the economy of its cost can be seen.</p>
<p>Scope of Application: The application of the Popular Education Cart is extensive. Generally speaking, it has the following uses: Education bureaus and education departments of various counties can use the cart to popularize compulsory education. It meets the requirements of the Ministry of Education's outline for implementing compulsory education, and mobile education cannot be carried out without using the cart. Local popular education centers, farmer education centers, libraries, etc., can use the cart to divide into several mobile education centers or mobile libraries to promote extramural popular education. Local popular schools can use the cart to divide into several mobile popular schools to increase the efficiency of popular education. Local elementary and middle schools can use the cart to assist extracurricular volunteer education and popular education to train students' ability to serve society. Local teachers should use the cart as the central hub, guiding young teachers to use the various educational boxes inside the cart to assist in the popularization of education. Education colleges and departments, normal schools, and secondary school normal departments in various universities should offer "Mobile Education" courses and use the cart to train students. Other educational institutions and organizations should use the cart to assist in volunteer education.</p>
<p>It is heard that Mr. Tai, to meet the needs of the education community, has entrusted the Education Compilation and Translation Center at 750 Jessfield Road, Shanghai, to manufacture and distribute the cart. Pre-orders are currently being accepted, with the full set of equipment and supplies, totaling over two hundred pieces, priced at only eighty-five yuan for pre-orders. The deadline is March 15, extended to the end of March for remote provinces. The center also has detailed brochures available for request.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"That is really the best, funniest thing I ever saw, especially those fellows," said Mr. Rice, jumping out of the room, for they had let him into the secret, and now he went along laughing like a great boy, now it was all over.</p>
<p>"Here they come; I heard Emil call out, 'Down with the landlubbers,' so we must hurry and dress," cried Nan, and away they all scampered upstairs.</p>
<p>The boys came back like a troop of lions; their breath of air had given them appetites that would have made a turkey tremble if that fowl had possessed the power of fear. Away they went to dress; and in half an hour such a scrubbing, brushing, and furbishing was going on, that any tidy woman would have been glad to see it. When the bell rang, a troop of rosy-faced boys, with shining heads, white collars, and Sunday clothes, filed into the dining-room, where Mrs. Jo, in her one black silk, with a beloved white rose at her throat, sat at the head of the long table, and, as the boys said, looked "stately and beautiful," as they always thought she did when she was in full dress. Miss May and Nan had on their new winter frocks, with bright sashes and bows, and looked as gay as flower-beds. Tommy, in his scarlet knitted suit and beaded boots, was also brilliant in his way.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer glanced at each other at the foot of the long table, and then at the row of happy faces on each side, and felt that they too had something to be grateful for, but there was no need to say a word, for one heart said to the other: "Our work is prospering, we must be thankful, and try again."</p>

<h3 id="e185">West Qing Volleyball League: Hai Qing Defeats Russian Army. Zheng Yiquan and Mai Bingyao's Fierce Spiking Contributed Greatly. In Another Match, Zhong Qing Forfeited, and West Qing Won Without Effort. <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Two matches were originally scheduled for last night's West Qing 8th Volleyball Group A League, but Zhong Qing forfeited, and West Qing won without effort. The additional match was between Hai Qing and the Russian Army. Both sides had won all their matches since the start and had the ambition to win the championship. A fierce battle between the two strong teams was expected. Therefore, many spectators went to watch. As a result of the match, Hai Qing defeated the Russian Army in straight sets, with considerable confidence in retaining the championship. However, the competition adopts a double round-robin system. The Russian Army's skills are not weak. There will be a rematch. If Hai Qing is not arrogant, there is great hope for the championship. The details of yesterday's battle are as follows:</p>
<p>Mai Bingyao Creates Waves</p>
<p>At 7:15, the referee Plator Silver Horn sounded, and both sides began to engage. The Russian Army served first and scored a point. Hai Qing's Zheng Yiyao responded in kind, tying the score. Mai Bingquan created waves, continuously spiking and killing, and the score rose sharply. The Russian Army was not weak and would not let others trample on them. Palokov flew into a rage and used a thunderous attack to regain several cities. At this time, the back and forth was wonderful. Zheng Yiquan and Yang Ziqiang coordinated well and repeatedly used unexpected attacks. The Russian Army saved well and made no progress. Soon, Mai and Zheng blocked and killed successfully, winning the first game 15-12.</p>
<p>Zheng Yiquan Lightly Swings Iron Arm</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, the Russian Army scored the first point. Zheng Yiquan's two opening cannons took the lead. Novushyonov struck fiercely, tying the score. At this time, the competition was fierce, and both sides had wonderful performances. After 6-6, the Russian Army suddenly became active. Qinnov and Palokov continuously spiked and killed, causing Hai Qing's lineup to collapse and lose points. In the blink of an eye, it was 12-8, and the Russian Army was leading. Then, Yang and Zheng's blocking at the net worked, and the Russian Army's momentum gradually declined. Zheng Yiquan lightly swung his iron arm and pulled back three points. Seeing the situation was not good,</p>
<p>Straight Sets: The Russian Army Suffered a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>In the third game, the Russian Army's serve failed, and Hai Qing took the serve. The Russian Army won a point. Zhang worked hard to strike and regained the serve, redeeming himself. Zheng Yiquan took advantage of the situation to strike three times, making it 6-2. The Russian Army requested a timeout, which really worked. Palokov lightly picked and fiercely killed, scoring three consecutive points. Zheng Yiquan immediately returned the favor, and Mai and Zhang assisted from the side, blocking successfully, and in an instant, it was 13-6, leading far ahead. The Russian Army made a desperate effort, and unexpected moves came out frequently. Several diving saves were amazing. Palokov once put his hand on Dicnis's shoulder and jumped high, using the momentum to strike, winning applause. At 13-9, Hai Qing added two more points, defeating the Russian Army in straight sets. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Hai Qing Team</p>
<p>Zheng Yiquan Mai Bingyao</p>
<p>Yang Ziqiang Zhang Renming</p>
<p>Baudin Gray</p>
<p>Russian Army Team</p>

<h3 id="e189">Finance: Indian Silver Plummets; Speculation on Gold; But Result Still a Drop of Eight Cents <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market remained uncertain and unstable. The market trended downwards due to weakening confidence, but showed some support after the initial drop. Ultimately, the price of Indian silver plummeted, triggering a surge in buying interest. At the start of the morning session, overseas silver markets in the UK and US were stable, with no activity on the ground. Forward silver prices in Montreux fluctuated, exchange rates remained unchanged, and the price of raw gold in London rose by one penny. The official exchange rates announced by the Central Bank remained unchanged for both the UK and US, and the Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The official standard gold price was raised to 1,147.90 yuan, but confidence seemed to weaken. Off-market forward trades opened at around 49.50 yuan, and major firms such as Dadecheng, Shunmao, Dafa, and Yongyuanmao sold off, pushing the price down to around 8 yuan. The morning opening was low but remained stable. However, major firms were keen to sell, leading to oversupply and a temporary drop. Sellers then took a wait-and-see approach, and support gradually emerged at the lower prices, stabilizing the overall trend. The HSBC exchange rates for the UK and US remained unchanged, as did the silver balance tax, resulting in a quiet and uneventful market. Later, buying interest increased, gradually driving prices up. The market trend remained stable at midday, but the announcement of a ten-anna drop in the price of Indian silver in the afternoon triggered a buying frenzy, pushing prices up. Despite some resistance after the second announcement of stable Indian silver prices, rumors persisted, buying interest remained strong, and the price rose to 1,150 yuan. Major firms sold off at the higher prices, and the final trend stabilized again. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1,148.20 yuan, a drop of 1.70 yuan from last Saturday. Fuxingyong and Huixiang made gains to 8.60 yuan. Dadecheng, Dafa, Yongchunyuan, and Yong sold off, pushing the price down to 7.70 yuan. The Central Bank offered US dollars at 25. Dadecheng and Dingkang made gains to 8.40 yuan. Dadecheng, Dafa, Yonghuixiang, Shunmao, Shenda, and Yong sold off, dropping to 7 yuan. Tianfa and Qianyuan made gains to 7.60 yuan. Huixiang and Dafa sold off to 7.30 yuan. Fuxingyong and Huixiang took advantage of the lower prices to make gains to 7.70 yuan. The HSBC exchange rates remained unchanged. Richang, Chunyuan, Yong, Fuxingyong sold off to 7.30 yuan again. Futaiyong and Dadecheng entered the market. The silver balance tax remained unchanged, rising to 7.80 yuan. Dafayong and Zhichang sold off to 7.50 yuan. Futaiyong, Qingfayong, Yongyuanmao, Yonghuixiang, Qiafengyong, and Qianchangxiang jointly purchased orders, gradually rising to 8.60 yuan. Fuxingyong and Dadecheng sold off at the higher prices to 7.90 yuan. Qingfayong, Richang, and Dingkang purchased orders, gradually rising to 8.70 yuan. The midday closing was 1,148.50 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 1,148.50 yuan. Chunyuan, Hengyu, Qiafengyong, Dafayong, and Richang sold off, dropping to 8 yuan. Jinfengyong, Qingfayong, Dingkang, Richang, Fuxingyong, Lifeng, Futaiheng, Chunyuan, Wanxing, Renfayong, Yuanyi, and Huixiang competed to enter the market. Indian silver was reported down by ten annas, gradually rising to 9.70 yuan. Yuanmaoyong sold off orders. The second announcement of stable Indian silver prices pushed the price back down to 9.40 yuan. Rumors in the market resurfaced, and Dadecheng, retail investors, Daheng, etc., entered the market again, rising to 50 yuan. Dadecheng and Fuxingyong sold off at the higher prices, dropping to 48.90 yuan. Tianfa turned in orders, and the closing price was 1,149.10 yuan. The market stabilized after closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price was the standard gold price announced by the Central Bank, raised to 1,147.90 yuan, a margin of over one yuan based on the closing price, and a margin of slightly over one yuan less than the previous closing. The March registration price was 1,145 yuan, and the April price was 1,149 yuan. The replenishment fee for the morning was 1,145 yuan, the same price in the afternoon. The red gold price was 4 yuan higher, at 1,152.20 yuan. The spot market gradually strengthened, mainly because the swap spread gradually decreased. The March to April swap spread was a premium of 3.5 yuan paid by the short side, with little trading activity.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In summary, Qianchangxiang, Yuanyi, Qingfayong, Dingkang, Yuanmao, Yongqiafengyong, Wanxingshun, Lifengchang, Futaiting, Huixianghengyu, etc., were on the buying side, while Richang, Chunyuan, Yongshunmao, Dafayong, Yongxianghe, Fuyu, Xiangfengfuxingyong, etc., were on the selling side. Dadecheng, Qianyuan, Yongfutaiyong, and Fuxingyong first entered and then exited. Richang and Yuanyi first entered and then exited.</p>
<p>Overall, the market was still unstable. The morning opening was 1,148.20 yuan, and the later closing was 1,149.10 yuan. The highest price was 1,150 yuan in the afternoon, and the lowest price was 1,147 yuan in the morning, a fluctuation of 3 yuan. The result was a drop of 8 cents compared to last Saturday. There were 182 public orders remaining for this month, with eight long parties and six short parties. The April futures increased to 12,999 orders, with 63 long parties and 39 short parties.

<p>(Yesterday, March 2nd) At the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the bond prices continued to rise strongly, and various groups were absorbing them with all their might. Brokerage firms numbered 43 and 52, among others, bought most vigorously. Various government bonds rose steadily in each session, and the highest prices exceeded the initial opening prices by two to three yuan. New high prices were seen on the trading floor. Rumors circulated about the issuance of a new type of circulating note with a very large amount. Cash positions increased sharply, and confidence surged. Various certificates that had not been circulating in the market, amounting to half of the total unified government bonds, were not yet listed on the market. Therefore, a slight increase could easily lead to high prices. The 96 bonds suddenly fell sharply, but speculators did not stop. Yesterday, from morning to evening, prices rose steadily in each session. The type A bonds rose the most in the first session, rising by 1.1 yuan. The type D bonds rose the most at the closing, rising by 1.75 yuan. As a result, market prices rose uniformly, ranging from 1.67 yuan to 3.3 yuan. The 96 bonds fell by 0.9 yuan. The total trading volume was 114,050 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market is weak and showing signs of decline again, mainly because the cotton market is weak, causing the related yarn market to decline. The Osaka Sanpin yarn and cotton market has resumed operations, and the downstream market price has further dampened confidence. However, the current yarn sales market is still able to maintain, and the demand from Hunan and Guangdong is particularly strong, according to reports.</p>
<p>Price of Standard Yarn Drops by About One Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market this morning, the market conditions for each month were mediocre. Due to the unfavorable situation in overseas cotton industry, after the second session, the Osaka Sanpin Yarn Market resumed operations, and the market price trended downwards, resulting in further lack of confidence and a slightly higher selling sentiment. As a result, the prices for each month were lower than the closing prices of the previous day by 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 yuan. In the afternoon opening, it was reported that current yarn sales were good, with strong demand continuing from various groups, and tight Japanese yarn prices. However, after reaching three o'clock, the trend reversed and softened. As a result, the prices for each month were lower than the morning closing prices by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 yuan. The price for this month dropped by only 0.1 yuan. It was found that 650 bales of Jifeng were sold, 1,200 bales of Dafeng, 550 bales of Senkang, 600 bales of Taichang, 1,550 bales of Changfeng, 400 bales of Xiesheng, and 1,200 bales of Runkang. 450 bales of Hexing, 450 bales of Xingchang, 450 bales of Tongfeng, 1,500 bales of Dachangcheng, 650 bales of Xincheng, and 750 bales of Gengfeng were purchased. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Over Two Thousand Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>The current yarn sales remain active, with a total of 2,075 bales traded throughout the day. The selling prices were the same as the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows: Hankou 90, Changsha 415, Guangdong 375, Inland 730, Xuzhou 150, same industry 115, Ningbo 15, Nanjing 15, Datong 5, Xiamen 15, Shantou 10, Sichuan 315, Wuhu 50, North 15.</p>

<p>The cotton market has returned to a state of weakness because US cotton prices fluctuated, with very little movement. Rumors circulate that Japanese factories have already purchased thousands of pieces of Indian cotton, but the selling prices and goods are said to be inconsistent. However, this has greatly impacted the market.</p>
<p>Price of Standard Cotton Falls Back</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market this morning, the market was flat and weak because US cotton prices rose and fell by 2 to 4 points, and Indian cotton trading was suspended. According to market reports, a fire broke out in a certain warehouse, destroying an estimated 12,000 bales of cotton, which slightly boosted confidence, with prices rising by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. However, after the second session, rumors were rife that Japanese factories had ordered 5,000 pieces of Indian cotton, and others said 8,000 pieces, with prices ranging from 52 to 48.5 yuan. As a result, the selling sentiment became even stronger, and the prices suddenly fell. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 0.15 to 1.5 yuan compared to the closing prices of the previous day. The price for March rose by points. In the afternoon opening, the market was normal, but the selling of Han cotton in distant months was weaker. As a result, the prices for near months remained unchanged compared to the morning closing prices, and the prices for distant months fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. It was found that 2,100 bales of Dafeng, 1,300 bales of Daji, 2,100 bales of Qingfeng, 3,300 bales of Yichang, 1,400 bales of Yongchang, 2,400 bales of Changhe, 1,900 bales of Hexing, 1,200 bales of Senkang, 1,300 bales of Taichang, 1,000 bales of Changfeng, and 1,000 bales of Yikang were sold. 4,100 bales of Zhenda, 4,800 bales of Hexing, 1,600 bales of Dachangcheng, 1,200 bales of Ruiyuan, 1,400 bales of Tongji, 1,200 bales of Dafeng, and 1,300 bales of Runkang were purchased. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Sales Slightly Clearer</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption has slightly turned sluggish, because the price ratio of Indian cotton is gradually approaching, and the source is 1,080 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a cotton yarn appraisal meeting on February 27 for the purpose of delivery for the August 1936 term. As a result of the appraisal of the grades, the 20-count Double Earth brand produced by the Xinyu Factory in the equivalent products was removed, and the 20-count Gas Balloon brand produced by the Dafeng Factory was added.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with flat market conditions, and the prices for each month rose and fell by 1 to 3 points. In the absence of progress in Washington, D.C., industry players are holding back and watching. The market price first fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and slight short selling, and demand was weak. Subsequently, spot traders bought the near term, and it was reported that spot cotton inventories had been reduced by 154,000 bales to 426,000 bales. Spot cotton demand was sluggish, and textiles were also inactive. However, it is estimated that sales of printed cloth this week will exceed production. The closing was firm, with spot cotton down 3 points, near-term up 2 to 4 points, and distant-term down 2 to 3 points. British cotton spot was down 1 point, futures were down 12 points, and Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 29th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Benares cotton on the 2nd was 190 rupees, down 0.25 rupees from the previous day's closing.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday, at the flour market, the opening prices for all months were initially stable, then became strong. Foreign wheat prices were approximately 0.23 taels higher than at the end of last month. Therefore, sentiment was initially very calm. However, due to adverse weather conditions and the lack of warmth, with ice still present in the north, it was speculated that the new wheat crop would be affected. Consequently, buying activity surged, and domestic mills also showed strong sales, leading the market to gradually rise. By the afternoon, the upward trend had slowed. However, there were rumors circulating in the market regarding the availability of supplies. While professionals were not actively bullish, they also did not move to a bearish stance. Due to the temporary disruption of shipping routes from Tianjin, futures contracts, even those expiring in August, were still being auctioned. The opening price was 2.888 yuan, and the closing price was 2.895 yuan, representing an increase of 0.015 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, at the wheat futures market, the prices for various months fluctuated. Although wheat prices saw rises and falls, the severe spring cold prevented wheat seedlings from growing, keeping sentiment steady. Bids were firm, with opening prices for each month rising by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. By the afternoon, trading volume for the current month was low, while trading in new wheat for June and beyond was brisk, and prices continued to rise. A single contract for August opened at 4.30 yuan and rose by 0.04 yuan in the afternoon. Observing subsequent trends, a stable upward momentum is expected. In the spot wheat market, prices remained stable, and trading was still brisk. Shandong wheat opened at 5.25 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat at 5.24 yuan, with a total of 2,100 bags sold by Fook, Shen, and Foo companies.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South): Yesterday, the supply from various sources suddenly increased significantly, with over sixty dealers arriving (carrying over 13,000 shih of goods). The market was initially weak, but activity picked up in the afternoon, stabilizing the price of thick early polished rice. The same was true for packaged stomach rice. Approximately 700-800 bags of thick polished rice from Qingdao, Yantai and other regions and 2,400-2,500 bags of thin paddy rice were sold.

Retail sales of white Yuan rice improved, pushing prices up slightly. Prices for other varieties remained stable.</p>
<p>(Guest Indica): Yesterday, the market remained firm. Suppliers were increasingly bullish, due to rising production costs and dwindling supply. After repeated reports of price increases in Jiujiang, suppliers remained firm. However, few sales were made by hoarders yesterday, with only a small number of late Jiangxi rice transactions. Domestic and Nanjing suppliers sold over 1,000 bags of brown rice. There was still demand in the market, and prices seemed to be rising gradually. However, the market stabilized, when some hoarders returned to the market. Throughout the day, approximately 1,500 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,523 bags of Xiang, Sha, and Han rice, over 300 bags of late brown rice, and 1,000 bags of Taizhou rice were sold. Due to disagreements between buyers and sellers, no foreign rice transactions took place.</p>

<p>The soybean oil market is experiencing a stubborn upward trend, due to supply shortages. Although there are some forward transactions (a deal was made on Sunday for 100 pieces of Dalian Qishan oil for delivery in two weeks, priced at 18.75 yuan, and 100 pieces of Dalian soybean oil, priced at 18.80 yuan), these are insufficient to alleviate the immediate shortage. Therefore, market prices are being independently posted by merchants to allocate supplies to customers. Regarding standard Tong oil, only Grade 2 warehouse-stored and light-skin peanut oil were offered by firms, with 200 pieces of warehouse-stored and 100 pieces of light-skin being sold. Prices were 17.90 yuan each.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Asphalt Price Decline Has Stabilized <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>When asphalt merchants and customers settled accounts, the momentum was extremely strong, leading to expectations that the opening prices in the spring would soar. However, since then, business has declined daily. Heavy Jing asphalt in Hankou has fallen by 17 yuan per base, while asphalt in Macheng has dropped by 15 yuan per load. Since the decline began, nearly a month has passed without any changes. Currently, both supply and sales are clear. While further declines are unlikely, price increases are also not expected. Regarding Zhejiang asphalt, the Jinlan area has the highest production volume. Since the beginning of spring, over 20,000 loads have arrived in Shanghai, all destined for soap factories. The highest price, delivered to the factory and weighed, was 21 yuan per load, but it has now fallen to 11 yuan. The reason is that the factories have sufficient inventory for three months and are temporarily refraining from purchases. Only Xiang Mao is still interested in buying, and it is rumored that they are in contact with various oil firms for a potentially large transaction.</p>

Zhen Ji Grade 1 was at 20.70 yuan, Grade 2 at 20.50 yuan, Grade 3 at 20.30 yuan, Grade 4 at 20.10 yuan, and Grade 5 at 19.90 yuan. After the price of domestically produced Chaoqing sugar fell, buyers and sellers held their ground for a long time without any reported transactions. Although production prices have not changed, shipping rates from Shantou have risen again, reaching 1,068 yuan. Therefore, some goods held by firms were sold. Tijuanqing was at 10.08 yuan, down by as much as 0.80 yuan compared to the previous transaction. In addition, over 300 bags of ordinary branch foreign sugar were offered at 14.20 to 14.00 yuan.</p>

<p>Recent excessive spring cold has affected the harvest of new mushrooms, especially in the north. Therefore, market prices have suddenly soared. The latest price for assorted mushrooms in Hankou has reached 98 yuan, and the tightening trend continues. Yesterday, the asking price was already 104 yuan. Although no transactions have been completed at that price, there is little sign of easing. Prices have risen by over 10 yuan overall. The asking price for Sichuan mushrooms is 115 yuan, up by 8 yuan. The asking price for airline small package mushrooms is 112 yuan. Other assorted mushrooms are also priced higher. The market still needs to guard against continued tightening.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Metals: White Lead Sheet Spot Prices Improve, Up 0.25 to 1.50 Yuan <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Sales of white lead sheets have recently shown signs of activity. However, spot goods are extremely scarce, resulting in a shortage of all grades. Standard selling prices are up from 0.25 to 1.50 yuan compared to before. For example, Grade 2 is quoted at 32.50 yuan, Grade 3 at 32 yuan, Grades 4 and 5 at 31.50 yuan, Grade 6 at 30.05 yuan, Grades 7 and 8 are quoted at 30 yuan, Grade 9 at 30.25 yuan, Grade 10 at 29.50 yuan, and Grade 12 and above (thick grades) are quoted at 28.50 yuan. It is said that Grades 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10 have been the most popular in recent trading. Other grades have seen only a few transactions. However, overseas prices are very firm, selling at 19 pounds and 15 shillings per ton, with the usual addition for base metal. No transactions have been made by Chinese merchants, so there is a risk of supply shortages.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Overview of the Work in the Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Rural Health Experiment Zone (Part 2) <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yunda</p>
<p>Work Overview</p>
<p>A. Healthcare Work: Environmental hygiene, street cleaning, adopt household self-management. Each household is responsible for the garbage in front of its own door and maintains cleanliness. This method can cultivate a sense of automatic cleanliness and hygiene habits among rural residents and must be strictly supervised and encouraged to be effective. Over the past few months, the streets have gradually become cleaner, ash piles have been gradually removed, and garbage is no longer discarded randomly as in the past. It is very difficult to eliminate open-air manure vats in rural areas, because manure is a useful item in the countryside, and every household has one or two vats for storing manure. We can only teach them to move or destroy those that are detrimental to public and family hygiene. We cover the ones allowed to exist with straw mats made of rice straw. This method does not cost money and can be done by rural households. At the same time, these vats are numbered with lime water on the outside of the vat, to prevent further increase. At the end of last year, we registered and numbered 494 of them in Jianbi alone. There are 37 toilets in the entire town. We prescribed two designs for them to be improved. One is fly-proof and the other is odor-removing. The former is equipped with a spring-loaded active door, screens and lighting windows, and a cover on the manure collection point. Each improvement like this costs about ten yuan, which rural people already find burdensome. Therefore, fifteen places adopted the fly-proof modification, and the rest of the households adopted the odor-removing method. The latter method costs only two or three yuan per toilet, which is bearable for households with financial difficulties. Along the riverbank, people are prohibited from dumping sewage and pollutants in places where drinking water is taken. People already know that polluted drinking water is harmful to everyone’s health. They persuade and supervise each other. Recently, dirty things are no longer dumped into the river, and dirty things are no longer washed in the river. At the same time, it is stipulated that tea houses and shops must have two tanks, one for use and one for alum-purified water for standby, and both must be covered. Teacups and towels must be soaked in boiling water every day. Sanitation-related industries, such as teahouses, wine shops, barbershops, bathhouses, etc., have been registered and managed, and various sanitary equipment has been added. People already feel the urgent need to rectify the blocked ditches. Local people are now initiating fundraising for repairs. The technical aspects are jointly undertaken by this office and the Zhenjiang County Government. This matter is progressing actively and is scheduled to begin repairs in mid-March or April of this year. School Hygiene: There are four county-run elementary schools in the district: Jianbi Elementary School, Xie Gou Elementary School, Qian Wei Elementary School, and Liang Shan Elementary School, with a total of more than 350 students. When we first arrived, in order to understand the physical health of children in rural areas, we conducted a physical examination of children in the district, examining a total of 22 elementary schools and private schools, checking 724 people. Those with defects accounted for 64.2% of the total number. Trachoma, malnutrition, and skin diseases were the most common. The classification of defects was: trachoma 24.2%, nutrition 31%, skin 23%, vision 16%, teeth 13%, hearing 8.6%, tonsils 3.4%, others 1.4% (Many people have several defects). After the examination, we treated patients with trachoma, skin diseases, and tonsil diseases. For those who are malnourished, we instruct them on the combination of plant foods and methods of obtaining nutrients. After this examination, we felt that it was necessary to organize school hygiene. We first conducted a children's health education experiment at Jianbi Elementary School, adopting a student guidance system. Twenty-four outstanding students were selected from each grade to form a health team, divided into four groups: health care, epidemic prevention, medical affairs, and publicity. Doctors and nurses from this office take turns training them at the school. After the training period, the health team members will teach other students, using the children’s close experience, close attitude and language to teach children and implement children teaching children, children leading children. The educational method is that the members of the health team cannot but set an example by themselves and pay attention to their own cleanliness because they have to teach other students. We will also review the students’ hygiene knowledge and behavior, as well as the work of the health team members from time to time, evaluate and improve students’ love of cleanliness and autonomy. Staff are often sent to guide other elementary schools and private schools and hold health talks. It is now planned that after the start of the spring semester this year, schools such as Qianwei, Xiegou, and Liangshan will also start the same health team training. Maternal and Infant Hygiene: Rural women give birth at the whim of old-fashioned midwives or family members. Childbirth often turns into death. At the beginning of the establishment of this office, we launched a free delivery service and paid attention to prenatal check-ups. Everyone who came for consultation was told about physiological knowledge, such as the size of the fetal position and pelvis, the distance of the delivery date, and all precautions that pregnant women should take. After delivery, the puerperal women also underwent multiple examinations and visits. Although it has only been open for a few months, as a result of our publicity and the introduction of Mothers’ Association members, many people believe in the new method of delivery. Midwives Wu Ruoshui and Jin Peiyu have a spirit of hard work. When it snows at night and the rural roads are bad, even small cars cannot be used, so they have to walk. The longest round trip takes seven or eight miles, but they are very happy and don’t feel any hardship. The next day, the villagers wrapped a few red eggs or vegetables and sent them to us, thanking us repeatedly. The honest and loyal attitude of the villagers is commendable. Midwife Training Class: In order to reduce the midwives’ resentment and arouse their belief in new methods of delivery, a midwife training class was held. The first phase of training included a total of six midwives from Jianbi Town. The courses included: 1. Outline of obstetrical physiology and anatomy, 2. Outline of bacteria, 3. Introduction to sterilization and methods, 4. Common sense of pregnancy and puerperal pathology, 5. Umbilical cord handling method, 6. Pre-delivery equipment and procedures, 7. Outline of prenatal and postnatal care, 8. Infant care method, 9. Usage of obstetrical tools and medicines, 10. Method of resuscitation of pseudo-dead newborns, 11. Puerperal woman care method, 12. Internship. The training period is set for 14 days, with two hours of lectures per day. After the training period, in addition to issuing midwife qualification certificates, each person will be given a set of disinfection basins, cotton gauze, and disinfection medicines. 5. Infant Health Experiment Station: There is a Infant Receiving Bureau in Jianbi, with a total of 128 infants fostered outside. The maximum number of infants kept inside is eight, and the minimum is two or three. Those fostered outside are subsidized by the Bureau for 5,000 copper coins per month to the foster mother, which are collected on a monthly basis. Subsidies stop after the infant turns six years old, and the child belongs to the foster mother. It costs five or six yuan per month to hire a wet nurse to feed a baby, which is more expensive. Therefore, the Bureau holds the purpose of "sending it out immediately". Therefore, there are very few infants in the inner hall. There are three reasons why children are abandoned in rural areas: 1. They are unable to support them, 2. The baby is sick and difficult to cure, 3. Illegitimate children. The former two are the most common reasons. Since the background of the infants sent is like this, the environment of the foster family is even more unmentionable. The foster mothers who come to the Infant Receiving Bureau to pick up babies are all poor farmers who cannot afford a cone. Taking advantage of their own fertility and lactation, they take another child to earn 5,000 copper coins per month for living expenses (some are because their own baby has died). Under these circumstances, the fate of abandoned children, even if they reach the Infant Receiving Bureau for relief, cannot escape the tragic pain of early death.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Impact of Food on Infant Eczema <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Infant eczema often occurs on the head and face, sometimes spreading to the entire body. Oozing fluids and layered scabs cause infants to scratch day and night, leading to restlessness, sleeplessness, gradual emaciation, and poor nutrition. Furthermore, this type of eczema is often difficult to cure quickly, sometimes lasting for months or even years. Although there is no definitive theory regarding the cause of eczema, food has a definite relationship to it. This can be stated definitively based on clinical experience. The following is an explanation of how food affects infant eczema.</p>
<p>The idea that food is a cause of infant eczema originated with American medical doctor Blackfan in 1916. He believed that food has a significant relationship to the occurrence of eczema in infants. In the last decade, a portion of European scholars have also acknowledged this view. His experimental method involved making multiple small cuts on the apparently healthy skin of infants suffering from eczema, then applying various food-derived proteins. Alternatively, diluted solutions of these proteins were injected intradermally in small amounts to observe any reactions at the application or injection site. The results showed that in infants with eczema, the application site quickly developed noticeable redness and slight swelling. When the same was done on healthy infants or infants without eczema, this reaction did not occur. From this, it was concluded that these proteins must have some causal relationship to the development of eczema. If eczema is caused by these proteins, then removing them should lead to a cure. However, among proteins, egg white, cow's milk, and breast milk are the most likely to cause eczema. While completely removing them may benefit the eczema, it can also hinder the infant's nutrition.</p>
<p>The phenomenon where a certain protein can cause eczema is medically referred to as "Allergen." The eczema and other phenomena caused by this "Allergen" are medically termed "Allergie." "Allergie" essentially carries the meaning of hypersensitivity and idiosyncrasy. So, how does this food-derived "Allergen" act? It can be divided into two types: congenital, acquired through the placenta, and acquired, passed through breast milk. When such conditions exist, the infant, from its food, such as breast milk or artificial formula, encounters the foreign protein and experiences the phenomenon of "Allergie," resulting in eczema. However, sometimes eczema doesn't occur, and instead, urticaria (hives) or asthma may develop. This has not yet been fully explained.</p>
<p>The occurrence of eczema results from idiosyncrasy and hypersensitivity, the so-called "Allergie" state. But why is this "Allergie" limited to certain infants and not all infants? In the acquired theory, the following inducing factors are necessary, for example:</p>
<p>1. Systemic infectious diseases as inducing factors. For example, after measles or vaccination, becoming "Allergie," resulting in adenopathic eczema, etc., is commonly experienced by us.</p>
<p>2. Local sensitization inducing "Allergie." For example, after developing febrile airway inflammation, influenza, or bronchitis, adenopathic eczema, urticaria, eczema, etc., often occur.</p>
<p>3. When there is an impairment in the digestive and absorptive functions of the gastrointestinal tract. For example, abnormal digestive fluid secretion, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, and other diseases, or drinking alcoholic beverages, coffee, and other stimulating foods that damage the walls of the digestive tract, proteins that have not been fully digested and broken down pass through the digestive tract walls into the bloodstream, causing eczema.</p>
<p>4. When the detoxification function of the liver is weakened due to some reason.</p>
<p>5. Changes occur in the distribution of bacteria in certain parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Decomposed food components, through the action of bacteria, produce abnormal toxic decomposition products, promoting the absorption of "Allergen."</p>
<p>6. Endocrine disorders. For example, when there are disorders of the thyroid or ovaries.</p>
<p>7. In addition, the stimulation of the skin by light, heat, cold, chemical substances, and changes in food.</p>
<p>In summary, when the above-mentioned various impairments exist as precursors, the state of "Allergie" is easily provoked by certain food components, leading to the occurrence of eczema. The above is for the acquired type. As for the congenital type, "Allergie" is obtained from the placenta. A certain protein passes through the damaged or inflamed digestive tract of the mother, enters the bloodstream, and reaches the infant's body, or the mother consumes too much of the same food.</p>
<p>Among animal-derived proteins, egg white and cow's milk are the most likely to cause infant eczema. Among plant-derived proteins, wheat flour is the most likely. In addition, there are egg yolk, wheat paste, potatoes, carrots, bananas, buckwheat, etc. Besides protein, there are butter, sucrose, etc. The following describes the major ones:</p>
<p>A. Chicken Eggs: Among animal-derived proteins, chicken eggs are the most significant, especially egg white. Therefore, some people advocate that egg white allergy is the cause of infant eczema. The reason why egg white becomes an allergen is said to be due to the albumin in egg white, mucin, and mucoid. Egg yolk is far less significant than egg white and thus not worthy of attention. Infants born to mothers who overeat chicken eggs or infants nourished with chicken eggs are prone to eczema. Or if the mother continues to consume chicken eggs, the eczema is difficult to cure or even worsens. Conversely, if chicken eggs are removed from the mother's diet, the infant's eczema lightens or is even cured. Raw chicken eggs are more problematic than cooked chicken eggs.</p>
<p>B. Cow's Milk: Although less severe than chicken eggs, it is also an important factor. Therefore, when eczema occurs in infants nourished with cow's milk, and a causal relationship is suspected, cow's milk must be eliminated. However, prohibiting milk for infants who rely on cow's milk for nutrition is a major issue. If unavoidable, employing a wet nurse or switching to goat's milk, prolonged boiling of cow's milk, or milk-free foods can lighten or cure the eczema.</p>
<p>C. Human Milk: Some people claim that it is related, but it is mostly insignificant.</p>
<p>D. Bird and Animal Meat: These are mostly not directly ingested by the infant but rather come from breast milk after the mother consumes them. The relationship is very small.</p>
<p>E. Plant-Derived Proteins: Wheat flour is the most significant. According to a report by Ratanel, a seven-and-a-half-month-old infant developed intensely itchy dry eczema on both cheeks. Inquiring about the mother's condition during pregnancy revealed that she had consumed foods made with wheat flour extensively. There was also an infant who, for six months, was exclusively breastfed and later developed eczema after being given bread. Therefore, experiments by various researchers have shown that wheat is the most significant among plant-derived proteins. Rice can be used as a substitute at this time. In addition, potatoes, oats, rye, barley, rice, corn, carrots, bananas, apples, grapes, etc., are all related to infant eczema.</p>
<p>F. Fats: This relationship is not very significant. Some believe that butter can cause eczema, and others think that chocolate is related.</p>
<p>G. Carbohydrates: This relationship is also minimal. Some claim that sucrose is related. For example, when sucrose is added to the cow's milk of a certain infant, the eczema worsens. Removing it leads to a cure. Giving brewer's yeast is said to cure it.</p>
<p>Although there has been clear experimentation on the relationship between the above-mentioned foods and eczema, there are also many opponents. These are briefly omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e212">On the Construction of Medicine and Pharmaceuticals with Chinese Subjectivity (Part 2) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Old Medicine Scientized; New Medicine Sinicized</p>
<p>Second: The nationalization of medical education. It is well known that the introduction of modern medicine into China began with the missionaries from the West coming to China, so although it has been a long time, the hospitals and art schools established by the churches still exist in the country. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, there was a plan to reclaim educational rights, and the voices at that time were loud and clear, with a strong momentum for improvement. However, looking at it now, what is the result? The greatest purpose of foreign-established schools is to train service personnel for their businesses in China to facilitate their cultural aggression. The smallest trick is to eliminate students' national concepts through anesthesia methods, making them forget that they are Chinese youth. The so-called subjectivity is completely based on them, not on us. Therefore, the courses listed, the textbooks adopted, the language spoken, and the writing used are all based on their country. How can one expect students to know how to take China as the subject in such a situation? Is it not like going south while heading north? Therefore, if educational rights are not reclaimed for one day, the construction of modern medicine with Chinese subjectivity cannot be realized for one day. This is the second point. (Note: The so-called reclaiming of educational rights refers to the fact that the administrative power of a school cannot be controlled by foreigners, while the hiring of foreign scholars as professors is not included in this example.)</p>
<p>Third: The nationalization of medical administration. A country has its own sovereignty, and a country that is not a colony has independent sovereignty. Although the health administration of our country is directly under the jurisdiction of the central government, it is actually in the hands of a certain foreign trust. There may be unavoidable difficulties in this, and it may not be possible to get rid of it for a while. However, being controlled by others is often restrictive, and it is ultimately impossible to seek free development and independent construction. Therefore, reclaiming the power of health administration is an urgent task at present. Without this, the construction based on China as the subject will inevitably be full of thorns. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Fourth: The nationalization of the medical profession. Confucius said: "Only fame and tools cannot be lent to others." Lending fame leads to abuse, and lending tools damages oneself.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a country is strong or weak, the people have their rights to enjoy and the responsibility to protect, which the government bears. If the rights that the people of this country should enjoy are given to foreign residents, what is the difference between cutting off one's own flesh to give to others? The medical profession is of utmost importance, relating to the strength or weakness of the race and the lives of the people! Therefore, all countries in Europe and the West spare no effort to protect medical rights. All foreign doctors are restricted from practicing in their own country, because they are not of our race, so they have no sympathy. They do not understand the national conditions, which on the one hand endangers the lives of the people, and on the other hand damages the rights and interests of domestic doctors. How can the lives and rights of the people be used as exchange products for diplomacy at no cost! Because of its weakness, our country is limited by unequal treaties, allowing foreign doctors to come to China to practice, which has led to the loss of rights and interests and the endangerment of people's lives. Thinking of this, it is truly heartbreaking! I have often thought that the reason why countries in Europe and the West restrict foreign doctors is that they attach importance to the concept of basing everything on the nation and the people's occupation. The national and national concepts of our people seem to be lighter than those of Western Europe, and they have always advocated the open-door policy, which has led to the position of the new medical community today. Isn't this the biggest obstacle to its localization? Therefore, it is necessary to urge the government to formulate and implement regulations for the management of foreign doctors practicing in China as soon as possible! This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>The above four points are all about medicine. Please speak again about the nationalization of new drugs: First, the management of foreign drugs. In recent years, imported drugs have accounted for a large proportion of imports, and the annual leakage is truly an alarming figure. If we conduct an assessment, we will find that they are uneven in quality, some are effective, some are ineffective, some are outdated, and some are harmful. All of them are allowed to be sold in China, which is related to the lives of the people, and it is not just a matter of foreign rights and interests! In the past, the medical community in our country had a move to identify proprietary medicines, but recently it has tended to decline! I sincerely hope that the government will clearly stipulate regulations for the management of foreign drugs, and that the medical community will jointly bear the responsibility of inspecting foreign drugs, in order to protect the safety of the people's lives and recover the rights and interests to the greatest extent possible, because we regard the people's lives and rights as the subject of the country. This is the first point. Second, the imitation of raw materials. The above-mentioned methods for managing foreign drugs are still passive precautions and are not sufficient to be called active resistance. They are still policies of dependence and are not sufficient to be called independent construction. How can we actively resist? Do not use imported goods. How can we build independently? Imitate the raw materials of Western medicines. Therefore, the management of foreign drugs only eliminates the obstacles to subjectivity, while the imitation of raw materials is the first step in the construction of subjectivity. This is the second point. Third, the creation of domestic new drugs. The effectiveness of domestic medicines has long been known to the world, but unfortunately, we are unwilling to place them, so that these valuable raw materials are buried in barren beaches and poor valleys. If we can study them one by one with scientific methods, we can create some effective and good medicines, which can greatly compete for a place in international pharmaceutical science, not just resist imported goods! This is the third point. The above is all about medicine, so what I call the construction of Chinese medicine and medicine with Chinese subjectivity is different from empty talk!</p>
<p>In summary, there are passive resistance and active construction! The two complement each other and serve each other. Therefore, if the invasion of imported medicine and medicine is not eliminated, there is no hope for the development of Chinese new medicine and medicine: If medical education and medical administration cannot be completely independent, how can we plan the construction of Chinese medicine and medicine with Chinese subjectivity? I have often thought that the civilization of Europe today originated from Greece and Rome, but its brilliance is a hundred or a thousand times greater than that of Greece and Rome at that time. Why? Because it can absorb the essence of Greek and Roman culture without submerging its own personality? China, from the Han Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, was the most prosperous period of culture. At that time, Indian Buddhism was introduced into China, and Chinese scholars took its essence and integrated it with the inherent philosophy of Laozi and Confucius, thus creating an independent Chinese philosophy. Although India has perished to this day, China should take the first seat in the world's Buddhist studies. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese nation has the ability to absorb and assimilate foreign civilizations! Today's acceptance of Western science is like accepting Indian civilization in those days. The key lies in getting its spirit and using its methods, but not swallowing it whole, not asking whether it is suitable for our taste, and stuffing it into our stomachs in a muddle-headed way. It is rare for those who do not develop gastrointestinal diseases! If we understand this, we can talk about the construction of Chinese medicine and medicine with Chinese subjectivity.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Common Discussion of Measles <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yahong</p>
<p>Measles is commonly known as "shazi" (痧子). This disease is almost a necessary infectious disease for children. As the saying goes, everyone is bound to get "shazi." If you don't get it while alive, you'll have to get it after death. Such absurd talk is, of course, not worth believing. However, the fact that children are very susceptible to infection proves that society has a deep understanding of it. However, because there has been a lack of research into its causes and treatments, many young lives continue to be sacrificed. Now is the time of spring, and this disease is spreading like bamboo shoots after the rain. I am now going to talk about the origins and course of this disease, hoping that readers will pay attention.</p>
<p>Cause: Although the causative agent of this disease is not yet fully understood, it has been determined that it is an infectious disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms: The initial symptoms of this disease are exactly like a common cold. It's just coughing, runny nose, fever, decreased appetite, and general unhappiness. People often don't pay much attention. By the time the eyes are red, light-sensitive, teary, the fever is high and persistent, and the person is listless, seeing red spots is when they realize it's measles, but it's already too late. In fact, in the early stages, if you carefully examine the inner cheek area opposite the canines and molars, you can definitely find small white spots the size of sesame seeds. The white spots are surrounded by a reddish halo. Because these are born inside the skin and flesh, unlike milk spots, they cannot be easily wiped away. We call them Koplik's spots. These spots are a unique precursor to measles, so seeing these spots allows you to confirm measles early. After two or three days, red rashes about the size of mung beans first appear on the face, and then spread relatively quickly to the whole body. The temperature also rises with it to around 39-40 degrees Celsius. After one or two days, the red rash gradually subsides and the temperature gradually decreases. At the same time, dandruff-like skin flakes fall off. If the condition is mild and well-treated, the patient will recover within this short period. If, after four or five days, the fever does not subside, or the rash suddenly disappears midway, these are signs of other complications. We must pay attention to the examination. The most common complications are pneumonia, otitis media, diphtheria, and cancrum oris (俗名走馬疳). In this way, how can that weak and delicate patient withstand the torment of disease on top of disease? Naturally, there is a danger to life.</p>
<p>Treatment: Currently, the only effective medical treatments for measles are the blood serum of patients who have had measles and are in the recovery phase, and the blood serum of the patient's biological mother. There are no other particularly effective medicines. However, general symptomatic treatment is also essential. There is one thing that I especially hope that patients' families will pay great attention to, which is that the indoor temperature should always be maintained at around 18-20 degrees Celsius. Although it is said that you cannot be exposed to drafts, the indoor air should always be well-circulated. The temperature should also not be too dry. In my experience, during the period when the patient is incubating the disease and does not yet know whether it is a rash or not, the patient's family, due to economic or other reasons, brings the patient to the doctor's house for diagnosis and treatment. On the way to and from, they unknowingly add wind-cold, so that the light ones become heavy and the heavy ones become fatal. The patient's family may mistakenly blame the ineffectiveness of the medicine. Isn't this a wrong to both sides? Therefore, all patients with measles, especially young infants, must be sent to the hospital as soon as possible. This is not only convenient for treatment, but also avoids the trouble of going back and forth, and can prevent the transmission of the disease to other children in the home. For families who cannot or do not want to send the patient to the hospital, the doctor must be invited to the home. Other children should also be completely isolated from the patient.</p>

<p>(79) The Relationship Between Syphilis and Nasal Diseases (Continued)</p>
<p>Tertiary Nasal Syphilis: Tertiary nasal syphilis is the most easily overlooked in clinical practice, and various dangerous lesions also mostly occur during this stage. This is also the period of what is commonly called "opening the skylight" (開天窗). This stage mostly occurs one to three years after syphilis infection, or later, eight to fourteen years. At the beginning of tertiary nasal syphilis, the nasal mucosa mostly develops diffuse or localized swelling with increased secretion, easily breaking down and forming ulcers. The nasal cavity is filled with yellow, yellowish-brown, or greenish pus. If the pus is wiped away, a red and swollen mucosal surface can be seen. These ulcers have sharp edges, and their bottom surface is covered with a yellow, rouge-like substance. In the late stages, the nasal cavity becomes abnormally wide, and the walls of the nasal cavity are covered with green or brownish-green scabs with a foul odor. At this time, bone defects are commonly seen, or even necrotic bone fragments are exposed. This condition is called syphilitic ozena. The most easily affected part of the nasal cavity is the bony part of the nasal septum, followed by the nasal floor and roof. Therefore, the nasal septum often becomes perforated. If the upper anterior part of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone or the lower end of the nasal bone develops ulceration and destruction, it can lead to a deformity of the external nose. Its shape resembles a saddle, so it is called a saddle nose. Sometimes, the disease progresses and is not treated. The nasal floor can be destroyed, and the palate can also be defective. During speech, there is often an open nasal sound. During eating, food and drink often flow backward into the nasal cavity. If the roof of the nasal cavity is also destroyed, it can cause meningitis and brain abscess, and other dangerous diseases. In addition, the patient themselves feels nasal obstruction, excessive secretion, a foul odor in the nose, easy scab formation, olfactory and gustatory disturbances, and pain in the head, nose, nasal bridge, forehead, and upper maxillary alveolar region.</p>
<p>Since nasal syphilis has the above-mentioned various dangerous lesions, we should be vigilant and not seek pleasure in brothels. If unfortunately infected with syphilis, we should seek medical treatment quickly and implement anti-syphilis treatment. If the treatment is delayed, this disease can develop and cause lifelong regret, or even death.</p>

<p>(Question 109) After the deciduous teeth erupt, how should children's oral hygiene be maintained?</p>
<p>Answer: After children's teeth erupt, because the food they eat consists of milk and soft foods, they easily adhere to the deciduous teeth and form a yellow coating. Therefore, medicated gauze or clean, disinfected cloth strips should be used to frequently wipe clean the area around the teeth. At the same time, the gums should also be rubbed frequently to strengthen the muscles and promote blood flow.</p>
<p>(Question 110) What are the dangers of children putting their hands or toys in their mouths?</p>
<p>Answer: Children's hands and toys are often stained with many germs and dirt. If they are put in the mouth, it is very easy to get infected. Therefore, children should be taught not to develop the habit of holding their hands and objects in their mouths. Also, children's hands should be washed frequently, and toys should be chosen that are non-toxic and easy to wash.</p>
<p>(Question 111) At what age can children be taught to brush their teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: When children reach the age of four or so, they should buy a small toothbrush with soft, fine bristles. First, parents should brush their teeth for them, and gradually teach them to brush their teeth themselves. They should be brushed every morning and after meals, and should be supervised frequently. The benefits of brushing teeth and the beauty of clean, white teeth should be explained to arouse children's interest. The development of this habit of brushing teeth is truly an endless benefit for life.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Climbing Changbai Mountain <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— (Lu Jusheng)</p>
<p>Ming Xing Jie, style name Bokun, also known as Kuntian, was a native of Yidu, Shandong. He was a Jinshi in the fifth year of the Longqing reign. He successively served as imperial censor, right vice minister of the Ministry of War, and Pacification Commissioner, with many military achievements. In the 25th year of the Wanli reign, the Japanese invaded Korea, and Korea appealed to China for help. Duke Xing was ordered to lead the army to pacify them. He was also a national hero. These two poems on climbing Changbai Mountain were written on his behalf, and their value can be imagined.</p>
<p>The mountain colors are vast, pressing down on the great wilderness,</p>
<p>Climbing up to take a look, my mood becomes exuberant and wild.</p>
<p>Wearing light fur and a relaxed sash, I reminisce about the shepherd Su Wu,</p>
<p>Holding a feather fan and wearing a turban, I am ashamed to be a military official.</p>
<p>The Central Plains can be seen in detail from here,</p>
<p>The surging rivers and seas evoke memories of twists and turns.</p>
<p>The Han people still have troubles with the Xiongnu,</p>
<p>Who will build a golden city ten thousand miles long?</p>
<p>Climbing mountains and facing the water doubles my sorrowful spirit,</p>
<p>Turning back to look at the Central Plains, my eyes are full of tears.</p>
<p>Who laments the affairs of the Han Dynasty amidst warhorses,</p>
<p>When will the weapons of war quell the dust of the barbarians?</p>
<p>Every commoner has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country,</p>
<p>Commoners are also subjects of the empire.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning shake, and sweet dew sprinkles,</p>
<p>Let all the trees face the warm spring sun.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Record of Exploring Plum Blossoms at the Shi Kefa Shrine in Yangzhou <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Wencan</p>
<p>The morning snow had just cleared, and I was reading when a guest arrived, heavily cloaked, and said to me: "You have long had a fondness for plum blossoms, and the plum blossoms in Yangzhou are most abundant at the Shi Kefa Shrine. Now they are almost ready to bloom in the cold. Why not go and explore them together?" I happily agreed and went with him. We exited the north gate and walked several dozen paces to the Shi Kefa Shrine. Turning east and then north, we reached Plum Blossom Ridge and ascended it. I thought that with their iron-like branches and icy demeanor, they must have absorbed the essence of heaven and earth and stood out in the wilderness. However, the paths were overgrown, the branches were half-withered, and only a few trees were blooming. They were the few remaining after the ravages of war. Alas! Plum blossoms, as things, are solitary, lofty, and detached from the world, and should be able to avoid calamity. Yet they cannot even protect themselves in times of chaos. How can a virtuous man who stands alone and acts independently not fear? We sighed together for a long time, recalling when we came here in the past, we only saw strong trunks of varying heights, and jade-like blossoms arranged in rows. We inhaled their pure fragrance and admired their noble qualities. Amidst the icy snow, they naturally shone together with Shi Kefa's unwavering integrity and loyalty. We admired Shi Kefa, as if we faintly met him in the dim fragrance and sparse shadows. How could they be felled and damaged, leaving only a few cold plum blossoms, suppressed in the cold smoke? This is even more lamentable! However, Shi Kefa, at the time when the Ming dynasty was about to fall, supervised the troops in the Jianghuai region. Although there was internal strife in the court and the fierce generals rejoiced in their towns, he upheld his great integrity and never yielded despite repeated setbacks. Today, although only a few plum trees remain, they stand tall amidst the remains of chopping and felling, spreading their fragrance in the season of desolation. Their perseverance and righteousness, their stern air and upright nature, are mostly similar to Shi Kefa. Therefore, seeing the plum blossoms is like seeing Shi Kefa. Moreover, now that the Hu (Qing) dynasty has been overthrown and the temple has been rebuilt, Shi Kefa's loyal spirit must be greatly comforted. If the plum blossoms had knowledge, they would also bloom with their brilliance to fulfill Shi Kefa's aspirations. I will wait and see. So I lingered with my guest beneath them, forgetting to return until dusk. Suddenly, the wind and clouds changed color, dense mists gathered, and the air became biting cold. We could not stay any longer, so we linked arms and returned together.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Visiting Yan Guang's Tomb on Guest Star Mountain <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Shufan</p>
<p>Yuyao is the hometown of Yan Guang. Guest Star Mountain, located ten li northeast of the city, is where he was buried after his death. His enduring influence and legacy spread among the people are no less than the Fishing Terrace on the Tong River. To the west is bordered by the Qian River and Cao River, and to the southeast is bounded by towering mountains and the vast sea. In the past, when boats and carriages were not yet common, travel was difficult, and few people from other places ever came here. Even the people of the county had largely forgotten him because the sacrifices to him were not properly maintained. On a solitary peak thousands of feet high, in the setting sun, who asks about the weeds on the grave mound, how green they have grown? Although I was born and raised in this county, I regret that I lived almost two miles away from the mountain. For many years, no one took me there, and when I grew up, I wandered around the country. My long-cherished wish has remained unfulfilled for almost thirty years. Once, at the end of the year, I returned home from visiting relatives in the province, traveling down the Shun River. Light snow had just begun to fall, and the wilderness was vast. I saw a crystalline peak standing before me, towering like a pillar. It was Guest Star Mountain, where I had longed to roam in my youth, showing its imposing form in the snow. Therefore, I immediately dismissed the idea of visiting relatives and went straight to the mountain. A magnificent archway stood at the foot of the mountain, creating a solemn atmosphere. The paths between the fields were frozen and slippery, making it very tiring to walk. After three miles, I turned into Yan Family Village, where Yan Guang's descendants lived. They farmed and fished, maintaining the customs of the Han Dynasty. I learned that there used to be a Guest Star Hall in the village, built by Shi Hao when he was stationed in Yue during the Song Dynasty, but now no trace of it could be found. Alas, how desolate the records have become! I asked the villagers about Yanling's burial place, and they pointed to a place deep in the white clouds. I climbed up the green cliffs, and the north wind was fierce, yet sweat still soaked through my clothes. Sometimes, snow falling from the pine trees hit my head, making me feel particularly cool. The mountain path was as straight as a line. With each step, I had to use my hands for support, moving like a snake or a cripple. I was extremely exhausted. After about an hour, I reached the middle of the mountain. There was a spring called Huaqing, where Yan Guang used to wash his feet. Although there is no proof of this, Sun Yingshi of the Song Dynasty wrote: "East of the county, the river is sparkling, and the tides rise and fall with constant sound. This is the Ziling Shoal, where he first fished and roamed. Ten li northeast is a strange peak called Chen Mountain (i.e., Guest Star Mountain), where he lived and was buried after his death." Whether fishing or living there, how could Yan Guang not have sung the song of the Canglang by this spring? After another four hundred paces to the east, the slopes leveled out, and a vast open space appeared. A mound of earth rose faintly, which I suspected was where Yan Guang was buried. However, there was no sealing or planting, so there was no way to identify it. Fortunately, the Gaofeng Pavilion on the left of the tomb stood majestically, providing mutual verification. The county gazetteer states: "The Gaofeng Pavilion is located to the left of Yan Ziling's tomb on Guest Star Mountain." Lou Yao of the Song Dynasty also wrote a poem: "The Fishing Terrace on the rocky shoal is not the old place, but the clouds and mountains and river waters are the Gaofeng." This means that the pavilion is the remains of the pavilion, and the thousand-year-old lacquer lamps can certainly be found among the desolate weeds. But after hundreds of years, the pavilion has collapsed and the tomb has been leveled. Who will come here to pay their respects? It is now the urgent duty of the people of the county to rebuild it. As dusk fell and I passed through the clouds, the valley winds howled on all sides. Looking straight to the north, the mountain was only a trace of green. I seemed to hear the ancient soul in the sky saying: "How can one dream of sheepskin robes and vast marshes in this day and age?"</p>
<h3 id="e219">Record of an Adventure in Jinzhu Stream <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Liu</p>
<p>Among the scenic spots of eastern Zhejiang, Yandang Mountain is the most famous, and among the wonders of Yandang Mountain, Jinzhu Stream is the most outstanding. Its famous sites from the Six Dynasties period and Xie Lingyun's inscriptions have long attracted attention. However, in the past, the roads were rough and unexplored, so even those who traveled to Yandang Mountain did not see it, let alone Jinzhu Stream. When I arrived at Yandang Mountain with surprise, I first went to Nengren Temple. The temple monk Kehua was an old acquaintance, and he found a local villager named Cai Huangshouchun to be my guide. This man was quite unusual, literate and knowledgeable. When I asked him about the itinerary, he said that those who visit Jinzhu Stream must go by the stream and return by the mountain, so that they can fully appreciate its wonders in both directions. However, going by the stream is extremely dangerous, and not everyone can endure it. Many people give up halfway. If that is the case, it is better not to go at all. If you go, you must be determined to enjoy it to the fullest. Can you take the risk? I am willing to be your pioneer. I readily agreed and followed him, with walking sticks in hand. After entering the stream for four or five li, there was gradually no path. We walked in the stream, the rushing water boiling beneath our feet. The current was very rapid, and the rocks were as round as eggs. If we lost our footing, we would fall into the stream. So we ran left and right, suddenly changing direction. Before long, we came to a narrow gorge. The pool at the entrance of the gorge was large, and the sound was like thunder. The rushing water flowed straight down, and the bottom was a wide, smooth surface with no rocks to hold our feet. The guide carried me on his back and waded into the middle of the stream. The current became deeper and faster, almost reaching our knees. The stones were as slippery as grease. If we moved our feet forward slightly, we would lose our balance and fall. I was greatly frightened and cried out. The guide struggled to stand firm and moved forward slowly, step by step. We were soaked to the bone, and after catching our breath, we continued forward. The pool gradually became deeper, and the scenery became more secluded and beautiful. In the deep mountains, there were no people, and the sound of zithers was heard on the rocks. The poetic realm unfolded infinitely. After passing this point, deep pools and huge waterfalls appeared one after another. First was Lower Pei Pool, then Juying Pool. The water was deep blue, and the pool covered several acres. After another half a mile, we came to Lianhuan Pool, which was the most spectacular. The water flowed down from the upper end in a wide chute, passing through a narrow channel and flowing into a wide pool below. The stone wall was not deep, only about waist-high. At the bottom of the pool were two small pools, appearing in the shape of double wells, like a pair of eyeglasses. The water was dark blue, quite different from the outer pool. Looking down from above, the distinction was clear and distinct. Further on was the main branch of Jinzhu Stream. A huge waterfall roared in front of us, and we knew there was a steep current. Looking closely, we saw a large waterfall plunging down like a swimming dragon hanging upside down. The current was extremely fast. Below was a pool called Lotus Bearing Pool, which was particularly deep and wide, several times larger than the previous pools. The light on the water changed endlessly, from white to blue to green. We were filled with awe of the deep abyss. We held onto the rocks on the side and moved forward. The cliffs were sheer and endless, with no moss and no steps. We had to crawl forward, not daring to look to the side. Our hearts trembled and we were about to fall. With great effort, we finally reached the other shore, sweating profusely. The guide exclaimed: "It is not easy to cross here. From here on, it is all rocky paths, so you can rest assured." Looking back at the opposite side of the pool, we saw the full view of the waterfall, which was even more magnificent, with a chilling, ghostly atmosphere. It turned out that we had not seen its full form when we were passing behind it. Turning back, we faced a pool shaped like a sheep's kidney, with thick ends and a narrow middle. Above was a broken cliff, hanging down into the pool, a few feet from the surface of the water. Vines and creepers hung down with colorful flowers, reflecting in the water with the blue sky. When the wind rose, it washed the pool, striking the rocks and making a metallic sound, like the tinkling of jade pendants. It was named Qiangjin Pool, a fairy scene not of this world, surpassing all others. We were mesmerized for a long time. The guide urged us to move on. Another pool appeared before us. A slender waterfall washed the stream wall, and the sound of the water striking the stones was peculiar, like pearls splashing. It was called Shuyu Pool, secluded and deep, untouched by humans. Even the apes and birds were silent. We suspected that the monsters of the water were spying on us from below. The guide said: "It is now fifteen li from Nengren Temple. We have seen almost all the sights of Jinzhu Stream. If we go further, we will reach a fork in the road where we can return." So we climbed up the high mountain and returned.</p>
<p>This newspaper recently initiated group travel to adjust the lives of colleagues and enhance service efficiency. The first event was held the other day, with forty employees participating. They took an early train to Wuxi, hired a boat to tour the scenery of Taihu Lake, and thoroughly enjoyed sights such as Yuantouzhu, Meiyuan, and Liyuan. The picture above shows the Jieqiao bridge spanning Wuli Lake, which is about a mile long and has a majestic presence, adding much to the beauty of the lakefront (photographed by Bozhou).</p>
<h3 id="e220">A Trip to Xiang Lake in Xiaoshan <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jiefei</p>
<p>On a day when the accumulated gloom had just cleared, and the universal light was clear and white, I awoke after a long sleep and felt a strong urge to travel. I hurriedly accompanied Mr. Wang Hong, and we boarded a bus at Guanxiangkou to the Jiangbin Sanlangmiao (Three Shrines) area. We switched from land to water, and the journey was about to begin.</p>
<p>The boat was newly painted, and there were few passengers. Looking around inside, there was ample space. It was the first month of the year, and the morning light was fresh and delicate, reflecting the peaks of Yuhuang (Jade Emperor) and other mountains to the south, like celestial beings in golden robes, suddenly appearing. The shadow of the Six Harmonies Pagoda resembled a large embroidered screen, lined with red silk, dazzling and eye-catching. The river water was clear and blue, shimmering like jade, with ripples resembling fish scales. This scene will be unforgettable for life. After half an hour, we arrived at Wenyan, a large town on the south bank of the Qiantang River. The residents were mostly boatmen, and the men were all out riding the tides, while the women were engaged in making paper foil. The streets were narrow, and the goods traded were mostly southern products, bamboo, wood, sugarcane, tangerines, and the like. We rested at the Xiang'an Central Elementary School. Even on their day off, the teachers and students were still discussing the "little teacher" system, which was very gratifying.</p>
<p>A little further on, we arrived at the Xianghu Zhejiang University Agricultural Farm. The surrounding area was all mountains, and the lake had been silted up to make fields. Further on was the training center for agricultural cooperative personnel. After walking around for an hour, we invited Mr. Yanmen to talk about local education. Standing below Ding Mountain, we looked at the pond water like a basin, the remains of the lake. The shape of the lake resembled a gourd, with the Kuahu Bridge in the middle, connecting the two banks. Ding Mountain and Yahu Mountain are both located in Upper Xiang Lake. In spring, they frequently offer rice shoots, and in summer, they sing about picking lotus roots. Perch and bayberries are produced in large quantities every year. There are also many historical sites along the lake, such as Tiger Cave, Yue King City, and Yilan Pavilion. Unfortunately, I could not visit them all. Further on was Yaohu Mountain, shaped like Xiaogushan (Little Orphan Mountain) in the Yangtze River, standing proudly and independently, surrounded by floating reeds. The Xianghu Normal School was located on the southern slope of the mountain, with male and female students bustling about, studying books and practicing arts, and experiencing life practically. Although life was simple and hard, it was of the highest quality. Extremes must be reversed, and reason dictates it. The division between those who labor with their minds and those who labor with their bodies has been erased in theory, and the realization of a return to the original model is now an urgent task of the times.</p>
<p>We had a simple meal of vegetables and water at the school. Although I have never been extravagant, I often wasted food in the past, far more than what I was consuming here. In the afternoon, we went to Xiaoshan, walking through the scenery of streams and fields, with mulberry and chestnut trees everywhere, and the sound of bamboo rustling in the wind. Having lived in the city all day, I felt like I was returning to my hometown when I took a walk in the countryside. Every tree and every patch of moss filled me with pure pleasure. The stone paths were narrow and winding, but full of charm. The villagers were content with their fields, and the women were diligent in making paper foil. We passed three or four Guandi (God of War) temples along the way. The spirit of fortitude, not seen in the capitals of Yan and Zhao, was evident in this gentle region, which was both gratifying and sad.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Record of Viewing Clouds on Lushan Mountain <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Minji</p>
<p>It has been five months since I left Lushan Mountain, and what I miss most is the clouds of Lushan. The clouds of Lushan cannot be appreciated by those who seek summer refuge in Guling, nor can they be admired by tourists who ride in "four-man sedan chairs." Rather, it is by gazing at the panoramic view of Lushan in the morning light, in the twilight, in the midst of fierce winds and torrential rains that one can see this spectacle. These conditions naturally qualify fishermen and farmers, and I, a soldier, only occasionally get to feast my eyes. Su Shi's "Record of Stone Bell Mountain" says: "Scholars and officials will never be willing to moor their small boats at night under the steep cliffs, so they cannot know it. Fishermen and boatmen, though they know it, cannot express it. This is why it is not passed down in the world." I think the clouds of Lushan are probably buried for this reason.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, places with good scenery combine the beauty of mountains and water. The mountains of Lushan are steep, and naturally form many waterfalls. Silver rivers and white ribbons cascade down thousands of feet, almost everywhere you look. The Poyang Lake and Sha Lake at the foot of the mountains, the fishing boats, the water birds, and the sea of clouds where the water and sky meet, all give poets endless inspiration for impromptu verses about Lushan. Moreover, they provide a large amount of water vapor, which condenses into the magnificent sight of white clouds.</p>
<p>On sunny days, a thin layer of white clouds surrounds the mountainside, not connected to each other, like warships sailing in formation. Sometimes they are closely connected, and a white ribbon locks in those who enjoy themselves on the famous mountain. Sometimes they scatter into wisps of smoke, perhaps the "empty city plan" of the poor people at the foot of the mountain who have no rice to cook? When it is "drizzling and raining, without clearing for months," the entire Lushan disappears. In the depths of the white clouds, one or two solitary peaks occasionally emerge, appearing and disappearing, and one does not know whether the peaks are inserted into the clouds or the clouds cover the peaks! When it is about to clear up, the white clouds gradually converge, moving from whole to part, very leisurely and free, like cotton wadding or willow catkins. Sometimes they spread over the graceful and solitary peaks, like a young girl after bathing, how charming!</p>
<p>The best time is a clear morning, when the east is a fish-belly color, gradually conveying red light and shining on the changing, moving clouds, giving them a layer of rouge color, red, yellow, light yellow, decorating them into a natural watercolor painting. Clusters of red flowers cover the dense forests, cliffs, and waterfalls. Who can tell the difference between the red leaves of late autumn and the red flowers of February?</p>
<p>Once, we climbed Guling and, upon reaching the mountainside, we felt like we were in another world. The affectionate clouds stubbornly entangled us. We could not see the sky above or the ground below. We were already in the depths of the white clouds. Upon reaching the summit, our clothes were completely soaked. A gust of wind was mixed with a strange air, not raindrops, not fog, not even smoke. There was a cold, piercing chill, some moisture that could be felt but not seen. This was the clouds of Lushan, and what the ancients called the misty rain of Lushan.</p>
<p>Another time, we climbed Five Old Men Peak and were overlooking the surrounding scenery when suddenly a mass of white clouds rose leisurely from the mountain gorge, flying over our heads. A refreshing air that could be smelled washed away our vulgarity. I wanted to pick a piece off, but I was afraid of breaking up its companions. A companion was stunned and repeatedly chanted, "Misty rain of Lushan, Zhejiang tide."</p>
<p>On many steep cliffs, one can see bursts of cloud shadows. The sunlight shining from the clouds is also taken away by the cloud shadows in bursts. Sometimes the cliffs are covered with cloud shadows, and a strong ray of sunlight shoots out from the cloud shadows, reminding one of the taste of a film breaking in a low-class cinema.</p>
<p>The clouds of Lushan are beautiful and ever-changing. "We cannot recognize the true face of Lushan, only because we are in this mountain." I think the true face of Lushan is the clouds of Lushan!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Little Western Paradise <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Valuing Profit Over Beauty: A Husband Reluctantly Parts; A Valiant Man With Lofty Ambitions Journeys to the Wilderness</p>
<p>Zhiqian smiled: "No matter where the hotel is, it is always a collection of people from all directions, so countless wonderful stories have emerged in this Little Western Paradise. According to the porter, the special commissioner last night listened to Ms. Zhu's report of her suffering, and expressed boundless sympathy, repeatedly stating that her life was not a problem, and he would definitely think of a way. It was these two sentences that aroused the wife's suspicion. Last night, she stayed up guarding Miss Zhu, not closing her eyes. Early this morning, she gave her two dollars and sent the girl back. But she also told the Hu family not to let her return to Jia Duocai. Jia Duocai went out early in the morning, and everyone couldn't find him, and they were completely helpless. This Sister-in-law Hu has come twice, and it seems she is very anxious. Beihai blushed and said: 'If we send this girl back to Old Jia, not only will these ladies lose face, but he will abuse this girl even more. It would be better to kill him with one knife, it would be more pleasant.' Zhiqian put his hands in his trouser pockets, paced back and forth in the room, and still had a faint smile on his face, unwilling to stop. Beihai said: 'It seems Mr. Cheng is very happy.' Zhiqian smiled and said: 'Yes, I am very happy. Today, you can know what kind of person I am.' As he said that, he patted Beihai on the shoulder several times. Beihai stood up involuntarily, staring at his face. Zhiqian laughed, 'You are naturally a bit confused, after a while, you will understand.' As he said that, he raised his chin and looked out into the courtyard, and repeatedly clapped his hands and said: 'Speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao arrives.' When Beihai looked out, an old man dressed as a worker hurried in. Looking at his body, there were many mud stains and water stains, so it can be known that he is a bricklayer. He walked into the house, raised his rough hands with knots, bowed his head, and repeatedly cupped his fists. Zhiqian pointed to Beihai and said: 'This is that Mr. Wang, look, aren't they a pair?' Beihai was a little surprised after hearing this, looking at the two of them. Zhiqian smiled and said: 'Let me tell you a piece of good news. This old man's surname is Zhang. Because he fell ill when he was working before, I said a few words of comfort to him and gave him two bowls of clean water to drink, so we became friends with each other.'" (410)</p>

<h3 id="e223">Whooping Cough <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>The transmission of whooping cough is due to the invasion of the whooping cough bacillus. The process is very long and can be divided into the following three stages: (1) Catarrhal stage, about ten days, with a mild cough, hoarse voice, and the same state as ordinary tracheitis (pain) and colds. (2) Spasmodic stage, with a unique crowing and flute-like deep inhalation, and unproductive cough. (3) Convalescent stage, if there are no other complications, it will gradually recover. From beginning to end, it usually lasts eight to twelve weeks. Children are the most affected, and the mortality rate is also the highest, so it is important to pay attention. According to my clinical experience, only "Bufei Pills" have a unique effect on this disease. Because the key to curing whooping cough lies first in calming the bronchial tubes, washing away phlegm, and this medicine has a remarkable effect in clearing phlegm and stopping coughs. In children, it can be taken four times a day, in the morning, noon, and evening before meals, half a pill to one pill each time, and another pill before bedtime. I have treated many people over the years, and it has never failed. It can also quickly cure colds, chronic coughs, and asthma in the elderly. The medicine is mild and peaceful, and can be taken preventively to nourish the lungs and prevent tuberculosis.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Saving the Stomach <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>The cause of stomach disease lies in the weakening of stomach function, so "strengthening the stomach" is the only treatment, and "Qiangwei Jing" (Stomach Strengthening Extract) is the best medicine for this condition. A healthy stomach leads to vigorous digestive function and increased appetite. If the stomach is sluggish or weak, appetite will be reduced, digestion will be poor, and the body will not absorb enough nutrients, leading to increasing weakness. For example, Ms. Zou Mingzhu, of Hatong Road, was eighteen years old. Because she overused her stomach during her studies, she suffered from indigestion, abdominal pain, belching, acid reflux, a noisy stomach, constipation, and mental fatigue. After two years of delay, insomnia and brain weakness also arose. Her complexion was sallow and thin, her menstruation was irregular, and last summer she also suffered from beriberi. She came to me for diagnosis and treatment. I prescribed "Qiangwei Jing," which also contains vitamin B and is good for treating beriberi, and told her to buy and take it herself. Sure enough, after taking three bottles, the constipation, bloating, pain, and acid reflux all disappeared, and the beriberi also subsided. Nineteen parts of her illness were cured. At the same time, I told her to continue taking it in combination with German "Bu Nv Rong" (Nourishing Women's Complex), and her menstruation became regular, her spirit became strong, she slept soundly as before, and her body gradually became stronger. She was happy to eat.</p>

<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. He Chongjun, was 26 years old and lived in the Bathtub Alley on Shanxi Road. He suffered from posterior urethritis, which was not cured, causing the gonococci to rush straight from the urethra into the bladder, causing cystitis. Urination was very difficult, and the urge to urinate was frequent. The urine discharged was acidic. Using the three-vessel urine test, the last urine was quite turbid. He was tired, had a high fever, and had a dull pain in his lower abdomen. This disease is most likely to cause tumescence. Once this happens, treatment is difficult. I urgently prescribed German "Clinon" to relieve inflammation, kill bacteria, stop pain, and clear turbidity. He took "Clinon" until four or five bottles and was completely cured.</p>
<p>Female Gonorrhea</p>
<p>The patient was Mrs. Zhou Yifei. First, Mr. Zhou suffered from gonorrhea and was cured by taking "Clinon." Later, his wife also contracted the disease. She took many medicines without success. He originally intended to accompany her to my clinic for treatment, but because his wife was a woman of the old school, she firmly refused to come. Mr. Zhou could only tell me her symptoms. I learned that his wife's vagina was red, swollen, and painful, and the mucus had turned into pus, making it difficult for her to walk. Not to mention sexual intercourse. I knew this was vaginal gonorrhea. I advised her to still buy and take "Clinon." Less than a month after Mr. Zhou left, he came happily to tell me that after his wife took "Clinon," her condition improved. After taking it for four weeks, she was completely cured. She had five blood tests, all of which showed no gonorrheal reaction. Later, she published a thank-you note in the newspaper and praised the great efficacy of "Clinon."</p>
<h3 id="e226">Menstruation and Conception <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Youren</p>
<p>The ease or difficulty of women's conception depends on the vigor of the ovarian function. This is reflected in menstruation. Normal menstruation, healthy and without disease, makes conception easy. Otherwise, it is necessary to rely on the power of medicine. Artificial ovarian stimulation with "Bu Nv Rong" can correct internal disorders and produce offspring. If the cycle is irregular, there is abdominal pain during menstruation, or it is closed or frequent, heavy or light, scanty or profuse, cold or hot, and this causes low back pain, cold knees, mental disturbance, loss of appetite, sluggish movement, headache, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, leukorrhea, etc., all of these can be cured after taking "Bu Nv Rong." For example, the wife of Mr. Xian, who lived in Yangshupu, was 27 years old, had been married for a long time without conceiving, and had a pale complexion, which indicated anemia. Her menstruation was always one or two weeks late, with little blood and a pale color. Her back ached, her limbs were weak, she had dizziness, leukorrhea, coldness, insomnia, weakness, loss of appetite, wrinkles on her forehead, withered breasts, and she was very haggard, pessimistic, and had an erratic temper, causing frequent family disputes. Later, she followed Mr. Xu to see me for diagnosis and treatment. I prescribed "Bu Nv Rong" internally and told her that the medicine was pure and mild and could be taken in large quantities. Before she had finished two boxes, the discharge stopped, her spirit increased, she was able to sleep peacefully at night, her spirits were happy, and her movements were strong. After taking several boxes, her menstruation became regular, her body strengthened, her relationship with her husband harmonized, and she is now several months pregnant.</p>

<p>— Dai De</p>
<p>Bloody Sputum, Fishy Odor, Heart Palpitations, Shortness of Breath</p>
<p>Patient Wang Fei, male, 31 years old, in business. Coughing with blood in sputum, sometimes as streaks, sometimes as clumps. Sputum is thick and yellow, with a foul odor. Experiencing shortness of breath with movement, rapidly increasing body temperature, accelerated pulse, and heart palpitations. Busy with too many things, unable to focus on rest. Has become very thin over the past five years, with lifeless eyes and pale, dry skin. Lacking energy and exhausted. Came to me for treatment last winter. Diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and suppurative bronchitis. Advised ample rest and prescribed large doses of German "Pulmo Nale" to eliminate tuberculosis and nourish the lungs. After about four boxes, the sputum cleared, the bleeding stopped, the cough subsided, and the fever reduced. Weight increased sharply. Subsequently, X-ray photography of the lungs showed no traces of tuberculosis. Has gained over [whitespace] pounds in weight this year.</p>
<p>Common Cold Delayed, Transforming into Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Patient Ding Zhongxuan, male, 25 years old, in the military. In the spring of the eleventh year of the Republic, a common cold and cough developed into a stubborn illness. Frequent choking sounds, white and greasy sputum, depleted energy, reduced appetite, stabbing pain in the chest and ribs, resulting in a weakened body. Face [whitespace], insomnia, night sweats, listlessness. Sought treatment from me after a delay of three years. Prescribed "Pulmo Nale" to combat tuberculosis and eliminate bacteria, thereby eradicating cough and sputum. Concurrently prescribed German "Körpertonikum" to cure insomnia and night sweats. Also advised on methods of recuperation, eliminating unnecessary worries, and resting quietly. After about a month, a sudden recovery was reported. Increased appetite, healthy body, and no fatigue even with heavy labor. Visited my office a month ago on business. Fearing recurrence in the spring, I advised continuing with "Pulmo Nale," as it is a preparation made from hormones extracted from the liver, lungs, and organs of animals such as [whitespace] fish, deer, etc., to nourish the lungs and strengthen the body without any harsh stimulating properties.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Yao Juyan, Physician, Clinical Report on Gonorrhea <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Clinic located at the corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and Prostatic Nerve Disorders</p>
<p>Gonorrhea, when initially occurring in the genital area, can be radically cured in the shortest possible time with appropriate treatment. However, if the patient procrastinates, neglects treatment, or the treatment is not effective, the suffering will inevitably become unbearable. Furthermore, it often leads to weakened reproductive capacity in various parts, which is also a frightening matter. Gonorrhea most easily invades the prostate gland. In patients without pre-existing neurological disorders, improper treatment can ultimately lead to prostatic leakage, causing significant reproductive damage. If the body is inherently weak or the person has a neurological disorder, they often experience unbearable local pain. When a doctor inserts a finger into the anus for examination, the prostate gland may not be particularly swollen or hard, but the patient experiences spasmodic pain from even slight pressure. In severe cases, this can cause fainting and loss of consciousness. Generally, it triggers the urge to urinate, but going to the toilet feels difficult. Many people are often unable to urinate in front of others, and experience seminal emissions. Insomnia is also a common occurrence with this condition. In short, gonococcal prostatic neuralgia is truly a disease where gonorrhea and neurasthenia coexist.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, I have treated many such cases, consistently using "Klimanon" and "Körpertonikum" simultaneously, with excellent results. Approximately 96-97% have been cured. For example, Mr. Li Beijian, residing on Henan Road, suffered from chronic urethral discharge for years, with recurrent episodes, causing unbearable pain. He had sought treatment from various doctors without improvement, leading to an inability to engage in sexual activity for over a year, and strained marital relations. As the condition worsened, testicular inflammation developed, and he came to me for treatment. I administered the latest German X-ray and electrical therapy, while simultaneously prescribing "Klimanon" and "Körpertonikum." After approximately five weeks of treatment, a complete cure was achieved, and the harmony in his marriage surpassed even that of newlyweds.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Self-Treatment for Weakened Reproductive Capacity <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Reproductive function is truly the foundation of prosperity for all of mankind. The strength or weakness of a nation depends on the reproductive capacity of its citizens. However, the vigor or decline of this function depends on the health of the individual. Generally, with abundant endocrine secretion, the reproductive gland cells develop well, resulting in strong vitality and a robust physique. Conversely, a lack of endocrine secretion, or damage caused by masturbation during adolescence, often leads to stunted growth, small and weak physique, atrophied reproductive glands, weak erectile strength, or even seminal emission and impotence. In women, menstrual difficulties, shrunken breasts, vaginal discharge, and numbness in sexual sensation may occur. Insufficient endocrine secretion often leads to neurasthenia, insomnia, poor memory, depression, and pessimism. Life becomes devoid of joy. Seeking remedies using ordinary reproductive gland endocrines may not be effective. Therefore, Dr. Melun of Germany invented [whitespace], extracting testicles and sperm from brave and strong animals such as lions, tigers, sea dogs, gorillas, and bulls and horses, and female ovaries, using scientific methods to separately produce the male "Körpertonikum" and the female "Frauen Schönheitsmittel." After taking these medicines, growth can be effectively promoted, and they can treat long-term infertility, insomnia, and thinness. Seminal emission, atrophied kidneys, and small sexual organs in men, and amenorrhea, vaginal discharge, and underdeveloped breasts in women, can all be remodeled. Furthermore, because they contain large amounts of lecithin, they can be used by men and women to quit smoking and stop [whitespace] quickly, eradicating chronic diseases and preventing relapse. The medicine is mild and has no harsh stimulating properties. If taken continuously for one or two months, it can also eliminate wrinkles, blemishes, and freckles, refine the skin texture, and make the complexion plump and beautiful.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea has always been considered difficult to treat and eradicate completely. However, since the advent of "Anti-Gonorrhea Serum" therapy, the results have been [whitespace] obvious. This therapy is a recent invention in the German medical field, and has been clinically tested with [whitespace] effectiveness in various famous hospitals and by doctors in that country. Last year, German national statistics showed an 85% reduction in gonorrhea patients. Recently, gonorrhea expert Dr. Yao Ju [whitespace], at great expense, imported a large [whitespace] quantity. This is truly an unprecedented undertaking in the country. After application, it is confirmed to be accurate and [whitespace] effective. For example, Mr. Wang Guangming, residing on Tongfu Road, suffered from chronic urethral discharge for many years, with [whitespace] bloody gonorrhea [whitespace], and swollen and painful testicles. The suffering was indescribable. He had [whitespace] seen famous doctors without [whitespace] being cured completely. After Dr. Yao administered Anti-Gonorrhea Serum treatment, he achieved a complete cure in a little over three weeks. He went to the health department three times for serum tests, which showed no reaction, proving that the disease had been completely eradicated. He has been married for several months, and despite drinking alcohol [whitespace] and working hard, the disease has not recurred.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Gonorrhea Medication Discovered in Test Tubes <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>… Differentiation Between Scientific and Unscientific</p>
<p>According to Tobenstedt's Medical Journal, the distinction between scientific and unscientific lies in the extremely different "new" and "old." Science advances daily, expanding into new fields, while old creations become unscientific and are ultimately abandoned. This can be seen in the gradual modernization of trains and ships. Medicine is the most essential science for humanity, so the latest inventions are valued, aiming to better meet the urgent needs of human life. Therefore, scholars and [whitespace] researchers are increasing daily on the study of gonorrhea medications, hoping to obtain a new invention to fundamentally solve the treatment of gonorrhea. After several research rooms and clinical experiments, they ultimately discovered the latest German gonorrhea holy medicine "Klimanon." Whether it is acute gonorrhea or long-term chronic urethral discharge, it can be completely eradicated. Dr. Helkart's Pharmaceutical Doctorate conducted a special experiment, taking the excretions of gonorrhea patients, extracting their fresh and lively gonococci, and placing them in two test tubes. One test tube, even with the addition of an appropriate amount of heat, did not completely kill the gonococci, and retained considerable toxicity. In the other test tube, a small amount of "Klimanon" solution diluted with distilled water was added. Immediately, the originally free and active gonococci stopped moving [whitespace] and died, completely eliminated. According to the doctor, this medicine, when in the human body, can even cause powerful phagocytic action of bacteria due to blood cells and antitoxic power, thus clearing the root of gonorrhea and ensuring it never recurs. Because the extraction of this medicine is processed by special electricity, and does not contain any inferior quality ingredients, there are absolutely no [whitespace] severe side effects or other drawbacks.</p>

<p>This journal has specially engaged experts to answer questions on various diseases. Please enclose sufficient return postage when sending letters to No. 869, Wuding Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission with Dreams</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Jining asks: I committed masturbation when I was young, resulting in neurasthenia, dizziness, and nocturnal emission with dreams. Please provide a solution. (Answer) Excessive dreaming is a main symptom of neurasthenia, which, if left untreated, may cause insomnia. The cause is a lack of endocrine secretion, hence the issues of nocturnal emission, etc. Taking the German "Körpertonikum" will lead to self-healing.</p>
<p>Recurrence of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Damin asks: My friend Mr. Hu has a history of chronic urethral discharge. His [whitespace] joints in the penis are swollen and painfully split, with red spots on his back, and [whitespace] itching prevents him from sleeping peacefully. He took more than four bottles of the German "Klimanon" and was completely cured. Recently, he contracted gonorrhea again after returning to his hometown, because his wife had previously been infected and had not received treatment. Can the previous medicine be taken again?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is advisable to consult Dr. Yao Juyan for diagnosis and treatment. Before receiving a diagnosis, continuing to take "Klimanon" may lead to a cure.</p>
<p>Thin and Weak; Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shicai asks: I have been a smoker for many years, with poor appetite and weak stomach, constipation, and an emaciated and bony body. My sexual organs are short, tight, atrophied, and I have premature ejaculation and insomnia. I don't know if there is any medicine that can help me quit smoking and treat these various ailments.</p>
<p>(Answer) It is advisable to take the German "Körpertonikum." This is an endocrine lecithin preparation that is most effective for quitting smoking and treating sexual neurasthenia and incomplete development. It can be taken in combination with "Strong Stomach Essence" to treat constipation and weak stomach.</p>
<p>Menstruation, Discharge, Coughing with Saliva</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yuanhan asks: My wife suddenly suffered from irregular menstruation, abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and infertility two years ago. Recently, she has also been coughing frequently, spitting white frothy sputum, with shortness of breath and [whitespace] fever. Is this tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is due to impaired follicle secretion and weak resistance, leading to the outbreak of pulmonary tuberculosis. It is advisable to simultaneously take the German women's holy medicine "Frauenbesuchsmittel" and "Pulmo Nale."</p>

<h3 id="e233">Further Discussion on "Birth Control" <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>I want to write a talk, but I can't find a topic. I have no choice but to talk about birth control again.</p>
<p>Jin Shengtan said, if you want to kill it, then don't give birth to it. If you want to give birth to it, then don't kill it. Zhou Gongying said, since you gave birth to [whitespace], why did you give birth to Liang? Fate makes fools of people, generally speaking. Therefore, Lao Tzu said, heaven and earth are ruthless, treating all things as straw dogs. Some people have property but no sons, while others have no property but many children: eldest, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth… So when a baby is born, it must cry loudly first. There is real reason to it.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with Mrs. Sanger's advocacy of "birth control." I strongly oppose opposing Mrs. Sanger's advocacy of "birth control." If you don't believe me, let's discuss the reasons for opposing Mrs. Sanger one by one. The other day, there was an argument that "good elements practice birth control, while inferior elements give birth," which I discussed the other day. Now let's discuss two problems with "birth control."</p>
<p>Some say, "Although cities in China now feel densely populated, the rural border provinces are not densely populated. Ningxia has an average of only one person per square kilometer, Qinghai only one to three people, and Xixia only one to six people. Under these circumstances, advocating "birth control" is certainly wrong." I also say that advocating "birth control" in these places is wrong. In these places, not only should we not advocate "birth control," but we should also encourage childbirth like Hitler in Germany and ban singlehood. So I will definitely not advocate inviting Mrs. Sanger to Ningxia, Qinghai, and other places to spread her doctrine.</p>
<p>Or some may say that multiplying children in flourishing cities and sending them to Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xixia to develop those areas one day, isn't that the same? But we should know that the national character of our country tends to be settled, and the concept of territory is very deep. Whether children from flourishing cities are willing to go to places like Xixia and Ningxia is still a problem. So, we should first clarify the way out, and then talk about birth control.</p>
<p>Some say that raising many children is truly painful, but Mrs. Sanger's method is wrong. We should advocate public child care. This is even more far-fetched. Under the current circumstances, is public child care absolutely possible? Even if it's not absolutely possible, is there even a fraction of a possibility? I think this kind of argument is not a valid reason to oppose "birth control."</p>
<p>However, there is a problem. Nature is dual, or even multilateral. If it's only one-sided, then naturally it can't be a problem. I once again invite those who oppose birth control to think of a few more grounded and practical reasons to put forward for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Children <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Guangjun</p>
<p>I love the children, and the children love me too.</p>
<p>Every day, as it's about to dawn, they come to play, jump, make noise, and sing songs in the yard.</p>
<p>My lonely mood and my homesickness are all dispelled by them. As soon as I hear them running from afar, shouting, my spirit goes over.</p>
<p>They are so interesting in their midst. Some are wearing bright and dazzling new clothes, some have stains on their tattered clothes. Hands, faces, surfaces, dirty ones, clean ones also became proportional to the clothes. I certainly love the well-dressed and clean children, but I still love the poorly dressed and dirty children just the same, because I, as the teacher, love the children themselves, not the children's wealth or poverty.</p>
<p>In class, they all sit quietly in their seats, eyes staring blankly at the blackboard, mouths following me as they read. Their serious reading, without the slightest carelessness, is precisely where their innocence lies.</p>
<p>After a while, if I ask: "Is there anyone who can't read? Who can read?" those who can read will raise their hands high, and those who can't will lower their heads tightly, peeking at me with their eyes—they don't know how to hide their weaknesses, but this is a virtue.</p>
<p>The ten-minute break is when they are busy. Hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs, I know that they have given me more to do. They come to complain: either A hit B, or B cursed A, followed by some witnesses, all talking at once. Sometimes, I settle the matter peacefully for them. Sometimes it is really impossible to deal with, and I can only gently slap them a few times on the palm of their hands.</p>
<p>"Will you dare to do it again?"</p>
<p>I asked in pursuit, and the beaten children said in unison:</p>
<p>"I dare not, I dare not."</p>
<p>Even if I beat them, they don't hate me. Instead, they love me. Seeing a letter on the table that hasn't been sent, they ask to do their duty to do it for me. Seeing that there is no water in my kettle, they go to fetch water without getting my permission. Seeing me with nothing to do after class, it's time for them to ask me to tell a story. They love to hear stories, even more than they love listening to me talk about books in class. I tell them the history of "Reynard the Fox" and "Andersen's Fairy Tales." They often listen so intently that they don't want to go home for dinner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they automatically propose to me, saying:</p>
<p>"Teacher, would you like me to tell you a story about a mouse stealing oil?"</p>
<p>"Teacher, let me tell you a fool's story."</p>
<p>"No, teacher, this story is about a 'Talking Foreign Doll.'"</p>
<p>I let them tell it in order of their names, but after saying a few sentences, they can't continue. They think, the more they think, the less they can say.</p>
<p>"I can't do it, I can't remember."</p>
<p>The other children all laugh. The storyteller turns red and hides behind people.</p>
<p>Only children are innocent and straightforward.</p>
<p>I really love this group of children. Whenever they are not in front of me, I feel restless. I am afraid of Sundays, I am afraid of every night. These are the moments that make me feel lonely and empty because I have lost them.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Nonsense <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>

<p>In Frankfurt, Germany, a young man was sentenced to six weeks in prison because the court considered a red tie to be a symbol of communist thought. The other day, Tan Laosan went out wearing a small red hat. His yellow-faced wife said, "I'm afraid you have a red influence." He based it on this. Tan laughed and replied, "What about the red National Emblem all over the place?"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company promulgated new charging regulations. The Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee sent representatives to negotiate, but there was no result. Users are waiting for the removal. Tan Laosan said, "It saves the trouble of listening to the phone and saves the cost of the phone. It's really killing two birds with one stone."</p>

<p>— Qiu Yuan</p>
<p>Zhuo Min began writing her letters, and she immediately sent many provocative replies: she had visited Zhuo Min's old home in H-land, and she had him... In Zhuo Min, how could he stop his own love, his love for Qiu Hua. Although he was already a married man, although he was not a man who had no romances before, he always felt that he and Qiu Hua were unprecedented. It can also be said that this was his first love. Not only was it unprecedented, it was also unparalleled. He now knew that love should have this kind of charm. His previous view that there was only sex but no love now seemed ridiculous to him. He began to feel that although love is based on sex, it transcends sex at the same time. The attraction of sex cannot be considered the entirety of love, there should be a higher part of it.</p>
<p>In a clean guest room decorated with many oil paintings, after looking at many paintings, talking for many days, and drinking some foreign wine that the host treated with generosity, it was already somewhat cloudy when they left Mr. T's home. Walking into a store, sitting across from each other in a delicately small room, looking at Qiu Hua's curly hair, flexible eyes, and her intelligent demeanor, streetcars driving past the window were thinking, thinking.</p>
<p>--These public buses are all empty, you see.</p>
<p>--Yes, empty, empty. Zhuo Min replied in a slow tone.</p>
<p>"Empty are the public buses, but is emptiness not life itself, if there is no love?" Zhuo Min thought to himself, without saying a word. The waiter brought in hot dishes one after another, and poured wine into the glass—that beautiful Tianjin Wujiapi, as lovely as a beauty's lips. Each person drank several glasses, and was a bit tipsy.</p>

<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>The night was as dark as ink. The street was languid and quiet. I was just about to go home from Botak Square, passing by the road called Sac Street behind the Rosa Li District Church. This [whitespace], saying it is a quiet [whitespace] is really so, saying it is a remote [whitespace] is also so, with low houses, thin sandy [whitespace] roads, filled with gloom and dullness.</p>
<p>I lowered my head and took slow steps, gently whistling to not feel lonely. When I whistled an American marching song, I was suddenly absorbed by a desolate sigh. It was so long and fragile that it seemed as if someone was gently exhaling near my ear. But when I stopped and listened [whitespace] attentively, it floated far away again, weak and quiet.</p>
<p>I was suspicious and felt a little scared. But I didn't believe that any ghosts were at work. On the top of the church was solemnly standing the sparkling cross. I looked up at it, gently drew a cross on my chest, and started whistling the American marching song, striding forward. I tried to take as many steps as possible, whistling regardless, just to pass this cursed place…, but my attempt failed. Before I had taken six or seven steps, that terrible long and fragile sigh came again. It was still so bleak and clear that I was almost surprised that it was following me closely. However, I was timid. I didn't have the courage to turn back to look behind me. I imagined that a large group of ferocious and hungry ghosts were following me. So I looked at the sparkling cross on the top of the church even more often, drew the sign of the cross on my body, and whistled loudly. But none of this worked, a miserable failure. I was deeply absorbed by a strange phenomenon. I discovered a gray-white monster shivering, and the dull sigh came from there.</p>
<p>I was shocked and stopped. I thought: this sounds like a person's voice, but why am I being urged to recognize it in such a late hour? So I quietly stepped closer to this gray-white monster.</p>
<p>This gray-white monster gradually became clear to me. I discovered a long hair, and a white shirt, followed by a body curled up like a scared pangolin. It was kneeling on the steps outside a stone room, holding its head tightly with both hands, and its whole body was trembling gently. It didn't seem to have noticed my presence yet, so I coughed deliberately, and stomped my feet loudly on the sandy ground. After a while, it raised its head. Two sharp eyes, a delicate nose, hair scattered messily, covering its entire cheeks. From this, I knew it was a young woman. She looked at me blankly for a while, and then, as if suddenly frightened, her whole body trembled, she raised her hand to me, and timidly cried: In the name of God, leave me! And put her head in her arms.</p>
<p>I hurriedly took a step back. When I looked at her carefully, I realized that she was naked. Her upper body was only covered with that small shirt, and her lower body was completely naked. This made me feel interested, so I said: No, miss, in the name of God, you can't refuse my help. I believe you must be an unfortunate and insulted person…, (to be continued)</p>

<p>The Proposal</p>
<p>Life is full of contradictions, hypocrisy, selfishness, and self-interest. Everyone lives in this circle. In this play, Chekhov's "The Proposal" reflects a real society. It unfolds as a comedy:</p>
<p>Ivan Vassilevitch Lomov is a young landowner in love with Natalia, the daughter of his neighbor Stepan Stepanovitch Chubukov. One day, Ivan, dressed in formal attire, visits Stepan, his main intention being to propose to Natalia in person.</p>
<p>Stepan, hearing Ivan stammer out his intention to propose to his daughter, is overjoyed and immediately calls Natalia out, telling them to talk face to face!</p>
<p>However, upon seeing Natalia, Ivan doesn't immediately propose, and their conversation leads to a dispute over a piece of land called "Oxen Meadows"! Ivan claims it was passed down from his ancestors, while Natalia insists it was passed down from hers. She claims it belongs to her and calls her father, Stepan, to prove it. The father agrees that it belongs to them. Unable to resolve the issue immediately, they engage in a mutually vicious and sarcastic conflict. Natalia, extremely angry, tells Ivan to get out. Ivan, overwhelmed by the insults from the father and daughter, runs out of the house in a panic!</p>
<p>She sits on an easy chair, gasping for breath, and waits for her father to tell her that Ivan came to propose. Hearing that he came to propose, she jumps up and immediately forces her father to call Ivan back.</p>
<p>Ivan runs back into the house for the second time. She immediately tells Ivan that the "Oxen Meadows" belong to him, but doesn't immediately bring up the proposal. Suddenly, they start arguing again, this time because Ivan says his hunting dog, "Ugadai," is better than Natalia's hunting dog, "Otkatai." She says his "Ugadai" is old and bad, like a worn-out horse, while he says her "Otkatai" can't catch foxes and only bullies lambs. He says he wouldn't trade five "Otkatai" for one "Ugadai"! Unable to resolve the issue, they again engage in cold and sarcastic insults. She again calls her father to prove whose dog is better. But the father says Ivan's hunting dog is too old and has too short a nose. Ivan, hearing this, becomes so angry and heartbroken that he faints and dies!</p>
<p>Stepan, seeing Ivan seemingly dead, panics and wants to kill himself with a pistol. But in a moment, Ivan miraculously wakes up! At this moment, Stepan immediately takes his daughter's hand and Ivan's hand and forcefully says, "She agrees! Quick, kiss!"</p>
<p>Indeed, Ivan and Natalia immediately embrace and begin to kiss. Although in a sweet and long kiss, she can't help but say, "Ugadai" is bad! Bad! Bad! He says: Good! Good! Good!</p>
<p>At this moment, Stepan loudly and forcefully shouts, "The happiness of the family begins, bring the champagne!"</p>
<p>The comedy "The Proposal" closes in the shout of "Bring the champagne!"</p>

<p>Another Officer: Do you really have relatives in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Old Xiang: We wouldn't lie to you. Wouldn't we be fooling ourselves if we lied to you?!</p>
<p>Another Officer: No, I'm afraid I'll just add a few more unemployed people to Shanghai! Well, if there's a ship coming tonight, I'll put you on board!</p>
<p>Old Xiang: (Extremely grateful) Thank you very much! (Shouts!) Xiao Lu! Come here!</p>

<p>Opening "New Daiyu Buries Flowers"</p>
<p>A beauty in Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Prone to illness, worried, and sad. She cherishes the beauty of the flowers on the branches. She gets up early in spring to tend to them. She orders the maid to insert them on the branches, tying golden bells to prevent sparrows. Unexpectedly, the heavens conspire against her, with frequent heavy rain and strong winds, devastating thousands of red and purple flowers, leaving trees without fragrant flowers. Like a beauty who suffers misfortune, a beauty's life is short and hard to last. The Xiaoxiang beauty is extremely sentimental, her heart breaks at the sight. Remembering her own delicate body is like a flower, but she is plagued by illnesses, like being exposed to rain and wind. She suddenly has the feeling of sharing the same suffering. Therefore, carrying a hoe to the trees, she personally builds a beautiful tomb to bury the petals, tearfully offering sacrifices in front of the grave. Her sad weeping wets her clothes, she hates that there is no way to change it. Because it is hard to find immortal medicine under the sky, and there is no soul-returning fragrance in the world. Today I bury the withered flowers, who will bury me in the future? Thinking of this, her heart aches again. She bids farewell at the tomb and returns to Xiaoxiang. In later years, she will burn the manuscripts and her fragrant soul will scatter, like fallen flowers drifting back to the wilderness. Although the beauty is dead, her name is praised.</p>

With anger and sorrow, she threw it to the ground, now the inlaid jade is inlaid with gold. He could not win the hearts of the people, and became king for only eighteen springs. Emperor Guangwu of Han. Raised an army. Punishing rebels and raising flags in Baishui Village. Suddenly the Eastern Han Dynasty continued the Western Han Dynasty. Reorganizing the country for two hundred and zero years. The portraits of meritorious officials were once built in a pavilion. It is said that there are twenty-eight star lords. First met. Yan Ziling. Dressed in fox fur, he performed rituals while fishing on the river. If he took off his fox fur, where would you find him in the vast misty waters? The emperor condescended to stay in the same lodging. That night, the grand historian identified the astronomy. One foot accidentally placed on the emperor's abdomen. The guest star has offended the purple star. He did not want to be an official in seclusion. He still returned to the forest and mountains as a hermit. There is still a fishing platform. Forever remembered on the Fuchun River. Emperor Guangwu still has no land. Only then did he know that the emperor was not as good as his name. Happy to spend a lifetime fishing and gathering firewood.</p>

<p>— Fang Lang</p>
<p>Yesterday, "Incarnation Girl" was filming a scene in which Yuan Meiyun returns from Nanyang to visit her ancestral home. Unexpectedly, a big joke occurred, which was both humorous and witty. I hereby record it to entertain everyone.</p>
<p>The plot of this scene involves Wang Guilin, who plays Yuan Meiyun's grandfather, receiving a telegram from his son Jiang Xiu, saying that the ship will arrive at the port on a normal day. He is overjoyed and hurriedly sends the servants to prepare a banquet to welcome his son Jiang Xiu, who has returned from abroad, and his grandson Yuan Meiyun, whom he has never met. However, Yuan Meiyun's cousin, Han Lingen, is extremely greedy and steals food, often suffering from diarrhea due to overeating. On this day, the scene being filmed was Han Lingen stealing food. In advance, director Fang Peilin had specially asked the props department to buy a dollar's worth of bananas and place them on the table. When the scene started, Han Lingen's gluttony and strange expressions while stealing bananas were all captured on camera. After several takes, there were very few bananas left on the table, and the banana peels were scattered all over the ground. At this time, Fang Peilin became a little worried and asked Han Lingen if eating like this would really make him sick. Han Lingen? He patted his chest, raised his thumb, and said, "Even if there's another dollar's worth, don't worry about it..."</p>
<p>Because he had said that, everyone didn't worry about it, and the scene proceeded smoothly. When they were filming Wang Guilin discovering Han Lingen stealing bananas and flying into a rage, Han Lingen's comical expression caused laughter throughout the studio. Unexpectedly, an interesting thing happened, making all the staff laugh so hard that they leaned forward and backward, and even tears flowed. That is, Han Lingen really ate something bad and his stomach started hurting, he ran into the toilet in such a panic, holding his stomach.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Silver Jottings <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The mass resignation of the publicity department of the Star Company has attracted much attention. According to the recent trend, thanks to Zhou Jianyun's mediation, Gao Jilin has temporarily dispelled the idea of resigning, but he will not go to the company to handle matters. After a month or two, he will make a final decision.</p>
<p>However, the news received at the time of publication was that Feng Xizui had introduced Wan Shuhan to the position of publicity at the Star Company, so it seems that Gao Jilin and others have no room for recovery.</p>
<p>After "Peach Blossom Dream," Da Tan Yu will present "National Beauty," and he will still consistently use his little cleverness - bringing his thighs to the screen. However, the audience who sit on sofa chairs in their hearts may watch it again and again and request a "re-screening"; however, the disastrous defeat of "Peach Blossom Dream" is a lesson!</p>
<p>According to a opera fan (Peking opera) friend, all the continuous dramas being performed in various dance halls now have inappropriate song and dance scenes added. "Tang Monk's Journey to the West" is like this, "The Legend of Ji Gong" is like this, and "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" is also like this. Try closing your eyes and imagining, in the sound of "Xipi Daoban," a section of "Aiya Ya" comes on. Those audience members in the soft and dreamy sofas are probably going to be intoxicated!</p>
<p>(Confucius said: Request a "re-screening"!)</p>
<p>"Everything here is not convenient to write in detail, and there is no need to write it, you will understand it naturally after watching it" "The first sex beauty film" "Lust" is going to be "re-screened" at Cathay soon, this is a special report.</p>
