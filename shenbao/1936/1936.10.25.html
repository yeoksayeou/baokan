<h3>綏遠產馬比賽寫影（下）</h3>
<p>— 宗亮東</p>
<p>開始比賽已是正午時分了，司令台上銀角一聲，千萬觀衆都翹首鼓掌，爭看勝負誰屬。比賽先是走馬預賽，遠度爲一華里，參加馬匹有七十參頭，每組五匹，以一分二十秒以內走法不錯亂爲合格。其才開始跑馬預賽，參加馬匹有一百四十匹，分十八組，每組亦爲五匹，遠度爲三華里，以速度在二分五十秒以內者爲合格。第一天預賽錄取跑馬七十七匹，走馬二十八匹。第二天覆賽時跑馬以二分四十五秒以內到達終點者爲合格，走馬以一分十六秒以內到達者爲合格，變換步法只以三次以下爲限，多則取消。</p>
<p>大會第二天恰遇星期日，觀衆更比第一日來得擁擠，上午開始舉行走馬雙賽，下午開始兒馬騾馬展賽，先由委員長及各裁判審查，展賽的標凖是要（一）血統要純粹蒙古種，（二）生殖機能要健全良善，（三）口齒毛色四歲以上七歲以下，但毛色須要鹿尾（棗騮），栗毛（赤兎），及靑毛（黑色）等三種，（四）體高由鬣甲項上到地面的高度須在四五尺以上，（五）頭要方，額要寬廣，耳聳立，眼淸朗有神氣，頸項適度分胸肋部，（六）體質要健康勇壯，器官發育毛光性和富春性，悍性要勇敢活潑，沉毅伶俐。展賽手續共分三步，第一是看體格方面，第二是看形質方面，最後才全部評判。</p>
<p>觀衆的視錢都着重在最後一天的走馬和跑馬的决賽，因此看台上和跑道外都是蠭湧着的觀衆。幾個有名的騎師，此刻也早已膾炙人口而更加興奮了，其中尤以前年比賽時榮獲冠軍曾受蔣委員長之獎飾的幼童李仁，尹世祥等風頭最健。據說前年蔣委員長來綏觀賽，見他只十三四歲的孩子，竟能獲得跑馬比賽冠軍，卽獎洋五百元，並囑傅主席栽培他讀書。最後一天决賽的跑馬，都是三日來迭决獲得優勝的馬匹，眞是「馬馬英俊，匹匹强壯，」比賽時風製電馳，奔騰風生，那時萬衆歡呼，空氣緊張，確是精彩動神的。决賽結果，以包頭縣李榮的大靑馬，成續以二分二十四秒五分之一捷足先登，獲得冠軍，而那連日引起注目的幼童尹世祥，却因中途馬韁折斷，馬的趨向不穩，而屈居亞軍。决賽完畢之後，大會委員長馮曦氏及傅主席等，集合各馬匹的第一名，舉行命名；兒馬第一名命名「龍駒」，產自薩縣，騾馬第一名命名「蕃康」，產自武川縣，走馬第一名命名「邊聰」，產自蒙地中公旗，跑馬第一名命名「北昻」，產自包頭烏拉特。命名之後又舉行展賽，各馬第一名頭上都揷上簪花，由軍樂隊領着聽候發獎，第一名各得獎三百元和其他獎品。</p>
<p>閉幕以後，各得獎馬匹又由軍樂隊領着從大馬路繞向舊城去，那時寬暢的馬路上，旗旌飄盪，樂聲震耳，萬人空巷，老老少少都出來瞧熱鬧，其是擠得人山人海了。</p>
<p>這一屆產馬比賽的成績，顯然的又比上幾屆好得多了；而尤其是以各蒙旗馬匹，參加的特別踴躍，而且還特別優良，但大會的重心都很注意品種的改良，所以會後對於改良品種的方法也特別注意。</p>
<p>近幾年來，綏遠產馬竟可賣到廣東廣西，而向來同以產馬著稱的甘肅也來購買，這可見得銷路比以前更大，而且中央軍隊派人來綏購買軍馬，每年總要幾决，這更使綏遠各地畜馬的人民興奮的了。據說去年一年產馬增加一萬匹左右，若以馬價每匹五十元計算，那就無形中綏省每年增加五十萬元的生產，這樣於財政金融方面間接影響到民衆的福利就不小。所以，這每年一屆的產馬比賽會，也可說是復興民族和經濟建設的要務了。（二十五年十月十三日記於塞北。）</p>

<h3>成都通信　成都與重慶（上）</h3>
<p>— 長靑</p>
<p>在四川，成都與重慶這兩個地方，就如南京與上海之在江蘇一樣，是挺有名的。可是有些四川人，你假使要問他成都和重慶究竟是屬於那一個省份管轄的話，那他就茫然不知了。不是筆者有意刻薄的來形容他們，實在是文盲普遍了的四川——不，說得擴大一點，全中國也是這樣——原是不足爲怪的。</p>
<p>就地理的形勢來說，成都倚山自雄，水流錯綜；龍泉（山名）岷山，前後屏障，岷沱兩江，環抱四週，形勢上自然可以稱勝，而在四川盆地中，更是一塊好士。只要是來過這兒的人，誰不知道「川西壩子」的土地，無一片不是黑油油的，每年出產着的大最的穀米，不單是可以供給本地的民食，而且還有大宗的輸出到上川東及川北各地少有水災和旱災發生，像「吃大戶那一類的饑荒悄形，更是很難見到的。重慶則盤據長江上游，握全省咽喉，水陸交通，四通八達，軍事上爲兵家所必爭，而塗山字水，又別有一番天地呵！</p>
<p>成都與重慶之問，相隔有千餘公里，一個在川西，是一省的省會所在，爲文化政治的中心。一個在川東，是長江上游唯一的重要商埠，全省的經濟力都集中在那裏經常的旋動。有人曾這樣　喩過：成都像現在的北平，而重慶就如上海一樣，只不過小型點兒，牠們是對立着，然而也有很密切的關係。</p>
<p>「上成都」，或者「走重慶」。這是四川內地人出門的兩句成語。在四川生長的人，幾乎個個都聽得濫熱，這話顯然是指示着出門人的兩個重要去處。凡在外「跑灘慣了的，他們的目標都是集中在這兩個地方，卽使是沒有出過門的一些窮朋友，萬一有時被逼着向外發展」，理想的地方，必然的也是成都和重慶。</p>
<p>所以，也有人譬喩成都和重慶是一對姊妹化；成都好像是一個　有書卷氣的大家閨秀；重慶則如一個俗不可耐的市儈女人。在前，她們是很不相容的，自從有一年從沱江那頭起，放了一串大砲後，便和好起來了。現在成都至重慶，交通上水道可由府河南下經嘉定，健爲，叙府東行便可到，陸路則只靠着一條成渝馬路，雖然也有其他的路道可通，但都是轉灣抹角的含有扣當的危險性，所以一直到現在，成都與重慶之間，總覺還有一層隔膜存在，要是將來的成淪鐵路完成，自然會轉變得很親密的</p>
<p>因爲歷史上的政治關係，在文物方面，成都是比較具有一種特點的；劉先帝本着苦幹硬幹的精神，在這裏偏安過；那殺入不貶眼的張獻忠，曾在成都稱孤道寡；什麽孟知祥，王建章……輩一些非正派皇帝官兒，都曾在此地建都立業，及到而今，皇城的舊址，依然的保存着；至於詩人如杜甫及「馳譽全球」的女校書薛洪度……等一類的名入，至今還留有斷痕殘跡，供人憑弔。說到重慶，「江巴不出才子」，古來的帝，誰曾垂靑過，於民可見得文物的貧乏了。</p>

<h3>胡展堂先生國葬</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>今日為國民黨中常會主席胡展堂先生在粤國葬之期。全國均下半旗。停止娛樂宴與會。於一片肅穆之中。滿貯悲愴之成分。蓋所以對此創造時會之人物。盡其最後一瞥之哀思。情緒旣無二致。步趨自易齊一。關於國葬典禮早經中央派員籌備。屆時儀式之隆重。自無待言。而參加祭奠之踴躍。尤備極一時之哀榮。中央旣已推派居正孫科等五委遄程前往。京內外地方當局機關團體。或派遣代表。或出自個人。並皆不辭迢遠。冠蓋紛臨。躋蹌盛况。蓋可想見吾人緬懷先生過去之勳勞。及其持躬厲屬之淸操。不折不撓之氣節。高山景行之忱。輒復油然而生。亦欲淤此。略致數語用代素旂之表。兼申崇仰之私。</p>
<p>展堂先生於本年五月十二日以腦溢血在粤逝世。距今適五閱月有十三日。噩耗騰布以後。舉國表示震悼。中常會第十二次會議中。卽决議舉行國葬。其後復决派蕭佛成等十一人為國葬典禮籌備委員。初擬遷葬南京。嗣以接納家屬主張。更選定番禺縣屬龍眼洞之獅嶺山為葬地。遺櫬原停於中山紀念堂。至七月十三日。始奉移至獅嶺墓園。並由國府於九月五日下令。以十月二十五日為國葬期。蓋經若干次之審愼商酌。數閱月之興築籌備。而葬事於以吿竣。從此窀穸奠安。幽靈永閟為先生計。宜可無憾。惟在一般拳拳先生者。旣傷形體之渺不可接。復懼魂魄之相引日遠。旁皇怛惻之情。要有難自解者。猶幸先生之讜言明訓。紹繚於耳鼓。可資惕省。先生之勁節淸操。鐫印於腦際。足供薰陶。如何急起直追。貫澈主張。所以吿慰先生者。固將在此而不在彼。</p>
<p>吾人亦嘗讀先生之遺敎矣。一則曰。「政治上之設施。必須順應國家及國民之要求。」再則日「全國人民應以保障民族生有之抗戰精神。來挽救中國之民族。」三則曰。「今日所深懼者。為民族意識之含混。民族情緒之頹喪。」蓋先生鑒於國難之日迫。深知非藉民族團結之力。將無自圖更生之望。故不憚反復宣述。喚起注意。迹其詞旨之所指歸。千頭萬緒。固不難以一語蔽之曰。蔚成民族復興運動而巳。不幸先生齎志以歿。孑軫豈無嗣響。全國人士於今日紀念先生之餘。關於此點。所當深切認識。時刻提示。引為後死之責。努力以求其達者也。</p>

<h3>中央銀行兌換法幣擁擠　奸徒乘機欺騙　葛振芳每晨携角幣前往　向入兜換短少數額詐騙</h3>
<p>自通行法幣以來、中央銀行之兌換事務、頓形忙碌、每日午前九時至十一時，持法幣往兌角票或將角票掉換法幣者、紛至沓來、此中人物、則以烟紙店職員爲多、有杭州人葛振芳者、向在南市晏海弄九十四號祥豐烟紙店爲夥，因覺此種兌換方式、大可</p>
<p>乘機欺騙、故其每晨必囊角票數百元、赴中央銀行、見有持法幣往兌角票者、彼卽向其人曰、吾方以角票來兌法幣、君旣以法幣欲兌角票、則正可以吾所有、易若所無、兩得其便、豈不較久候之爲愈乎、凡欲換角票之人、莫不希望速竣其事、不願久候費時、多依葛言、與之互換、葛則視對方</p>
<p>相需數額、或五十元、或百元、遂探囊出角票付之、票俱疊紮整齊、每紮五元·十元·二十元·不等、葛受法幣、輒不俟對方點數完畢、掉頭自去、故兌者後雖發現角票數額、與所兌之數缺少、而已無從覓葛之踪跡矣、金錢蝕耗、惟有徒呼負負、葛則僅一舉手之勞、</p>

<p>厲聲斥責葛因自知缺點、不敢爭論、承認點數不淸、並將所少補足、方私相慶幸彌縫得體、秘密不致敗露、豈知聚於該處之兌票人羣之中、適有曾經受欺者在、一爲三井洋行出店邱金生、於本月二十一日赴中央掉角票五十元、在該處與葛相遇、遂向葛兌、及點數則缺少十五元、而葛已無踪、邱祗得</p>
<p>自認晦氣一爲新永安街乾瑞和乾昌和兩烟紙聯號職員邵伯棠史良樸、同於本月十九日、各向中央兌角票五十元、亦與葛遇、由葛兌給、則共缺少十元、於是邱·邵·史·三人將葛包圍、惟形似出店之人、此際因萬已將所缺補足、獨自歸去、旋經該行八十四號司閽捕見此情狀、詰問一過、隨扭葛往總巡捕房、派探目蔣上佩搜索之下、於葛身畔</p>
<p>抄出法幣二十四元、角票三百九十五元、一併於昨晨解送第一特區地方法院、由葉聖超推事提審、捕房律師錢徇九、陳明被告欺騙情形、請依照刑法三百三十九條懲治、但尚恐被騙者或不僅邱等三四人、故請將案延期、容捕房再行詳細調查、庭上遂向葛振芳質訊欺騙情狀一過、諭被告收押、展期下屋期四再訊、</p>

<p>申報兒童專刊童子軍  寓意　　小弟弟，小妹妹，你們在學校裏到了五六年級，就要做童子軍了，我覺得很是可喜。　　為什麽我見你們做童子軍覺得歡喜呢？那是因為我覺得你們穿了童子軍的衣服，很顯得威武勇敢，可以代表中國的一種新精神！　　回憶當我像你們年紀的時候，我可享不到你們這般的幸福，那時沒有童子軍，我們沒有穿像你們這般莊嚴的服裝，顯不出活潑勇武的精神。　　童子軍的訓練，是使你們活潑勇敢與博愛，練習人生必須的技能與智識，教你們如何烹調露營，教你們「日行一善；」教你們「見義勇為。」這種訓練，在沒有普遍組織童子軍的時候，只有在教科書上或者可以知道一些，不過這確是一種非常有意義的訓練，現在能普遍實行，實在是好現象。　　小弟弟，小妹妹，希望你們做了童子軍，得到很多的好處，能幫助自己，幫助別人，幫助國家！兒童掌故隨談  易生　　衛玠問夢　　衛玠是一個著名的美男子，他走路上總有很多的婦女，搶著瞧他的容顔，所以當時有「看煞衛玠」這句成語。他不但美貌，並也多才，從小就好學不倦的。他在頭髪纔可束結起來的時候，對於做夢的事理極其懷疑，不肯像普通孩子們那麽地隨意放過便去請教於樂廣先生。樂先生解釋著：『夢是意想所結』。衛玠又問：『精神與身形都沒有接觸過的事物也會入夢，難道那也出於意想之間的麽麽』？樂先生道：『那總是有因由的。誰也不曾夢見乘了車兒却行入鼠穴去，或者　了菜　却嚼吃杵的，却只為沒有這種意想也沒有這些因由的緣故哪』。衛玠唯唯告退歸家，成日地思忖「什麽呌因由」總想不通。空間一個小小的腦袋經　　　　，他便積思成病了。樂先生知道了情由，連忙乘車到他家裏，十分詳細地替他分析辨解。他的病消退得很快。樂先生不覺讚歎說道：『這個孩子的胸懷中應該不生隔病—有什麽東西滯留阻隔在中瞧而成病—的了』！　　孔夫子教我們，「疑思問」實在這是求學的最初步工程，不可稍為疏忽一些的！可奈現在的小朋友們肯問的已是不多，問過之後復難免還不會澈底明瞭，肯再三去向先生討教的更是很少了！這個形情也有三種因由構成：一種習慣懶惰，百凡不求甚解，根本不要問了；再有一種是假作聰明，若問了再問，恐被同伴們看低他的天資；更有一種是知難而退，恐怕繼續請問未必便會豁然開朗於懷，却多份會惹起師長的厭煩，而見於辭色之間。三者有一於此，孩子們便不得「知之為知之，不知為不知」了。這是有賴於為師為長者之啟發與善誘炎多的，據我的意見。西兒的覺悟  方正　　中兒和西兒是弟兄倆，同在××校讀學書；他們倆不但有互相敬愛的精神，而且還有團結力呢！偶然有人欺侮他們的時候，立刻共同起來把那個欺侮他們的敵人打個痛快！所以真可讃他們倆一聲：「友愛」哩！　　可是自從去年他們的學校二年級裏，來了一個綽號呌做矮東瓜的京兒後，他們的的感情，竟漸漸淡下來了。因為矮東瓜年紀雖小，着實是個壞孩子，他能夠在中兒面前說：「西兒在罵你！」但同時又在西兒面前說：「中兒說你壞話！」經他這樣一慫恿，素來一對最友愛的兄弟，却不能不變為陌生仇敵，而且還各不相讓的鬩牆起來。但矮東瓜却當把戲看，暗暗好笑。有時還在同學中吹他慫恿的本領，如何高強！　　有一天，他又慫恿西兒去偷中兒的自來水筆來借給自己。可是西兒無知，終於上他當了。第二天上課時，中兒發現自來水筆沒有了，四處找尋也沒有發現。於是告訴了師長，經他偵查之下，却在矮東瓜書包裹搜出了。大家都以為必是這壞蛋偷的，於是硬要求師長開除他。但不料矮東瓜不慌不忙的把西兒借給他的原因，以及西兒偷取的情形，說給師長聽。又把自來水筆當大家面還給西兒。這樣矮東瓜非但沒有開除學籍，而且西兒却被師長教訓一頓。　　西兒回到家裏，暗忖怎樣對得起哥哥和父母呢？我該覺悟，上了人家的詭計。就立刻向哥哥賠禮，一方面却和中兒立一個誓道：「永不和矮東瓜交結，恢復我們固有的團結力，打倒我們的敵人，須知兄弟鬩牆，足以破壞一切的！」　　小朋友！讀了作何感想呢？馬的故事  歐陽輝　　很久很久以前的時候，森林蔭大道裏，一羣很自在的馬，都在唉聲歎氣的說道：「為什麽我們總是受着那些有角的魔鬼—鹿—來欺負的呢？難道我們真的不能抵抗它嗎？？」但是它們終沒有力量和鹿抵抗，因為，一見了它，它的心便卜卜的跳着，一切的反抗力都失掉，垂直了馬尾的逃走了。一天，那些馬羣都在森林外散步着，遇見了兩個獵人，它們便起了復仇之心，都在獵人的面前，用着很哀戚的樣子來告訴他們，懇求他替它們復仇。那獵人一口允許了。它們就俯跪着，讓那些獵人騎上，就帶他到敵人的所在；那些獵人，便把那些鹿驅走和刺死。那兩隻馬見大仇已報，以為可以放了心，便很歡喜的樣子，想辭別了那些獵人回去了，但是他們，却帶着冷笑的樣子說道：「哼！可沒有這麽容易呀！我們還須用着你們呢！」便拿兩根粗繩子，老實不客氣，牽着它倆，帶到這辛苦的世界上來了。兒童自由書  　　　最大的花和最小的鳥  明心　　小朋友們，吾們平常所見到的花朵，不是最大只有手掌那麽樣大嗎？可是在菲列賓却有一種奇特的植物，它所開的花要算是世界上最大的花朵了，當盛開的時候，直徑足要有三尺多長，——一株小小的桃樹那麽樣大，還不能說是最大的花朵嗎　　小朋友們想來都已經知道，植物的花朵裏的雄蕊上的花粉，傳到雌蕊上去，才會結成菓實花粉有由流水來傳送的稱為水媒；有由風力來傳送的，稱為風媒；有由蜜蜂蝴蝶蛾等昆虫們來傳送的，稱為虫媒；另外又有些植物是由蝙蝠或蝸牛來傳送花粉的，可是在美洲熱帶地方却有一種小鳥也能夠傳送花粉的，就稱為鳥媒，這種小鳥的身體輕而且小，只有半張報紙那樣的十多公分重，小得和蜜蜂差不多大小，所以人們呌它做蜂鳥，蜂鳥可算是世界上最小的一種鳥了，蜂鳥的嘴很是細長，極便於吸取花蜜，開關和顔色都很美麗，背上有鮮明的翠綠色的羽毛，喉部胸部和腹部的絨毛，紅而有光彩，呌起聲音來，清脆得很，它的家住在密密小樹葉裏，造得非常的巧，它常在花叢裏像蜂蝶般的穿來穿去的飛着，用那細長的小嘴，伸進花朵裏去吸取鮮花的甜蜜，它有時候也捉些小的害虫來吃，當它伸長嘴進花朵裏去吸蜜的時候，在無意中，却把花粉散著在長嘴上的羽毛上，又傳送到別的花朵裏去了。兒童創作兩個專喜雜食的同學  萬竹小學校四年級女生曹梅瑛　　我的同學中，有一殷姓的女生，她的家中，也很富裕，所以她的衣袋裏，時常麥克麥克，不過在校中，對於功課，不甚用功，而雜食一類，　非常考究。她每日到校後，專喜　買雜食來吃。有一天早上，我看見她買了兩隻麵包，還有牛肉，不多時，就吃個精光。上了兩課，那吃下肚的東西，發作起來了，頓時鬧着腹痛，就向教師告假回家，不料一病月餘，　廢功課，　學期恐又不能升級了。　　同學中有一張姓的男生，年約十三四歲，對於功課，非常用功。他的家中，比我富裕，所以他的衣袋裏，也時常麥克麥克。我真不懂，他為甚　時常要患牙痛，後來經我探問別的同學，才知道他是專喜購買雜食來吃的。雜食中，尤其是　果，如共生糖茄啡糖等香燥東西，最喜歡吃。上星期一，他患牙痛病　假，「到現在已有一個多星期，那下學期的成績，不免也要受影響了。　　現在我拿　　同學寫出來投稿，並無惡意，殷張兩同學，假使不喜歡雜食，那身體上或不致多生病痛，金錢也不致浪費，希望全國的小朋友，不要多買雜食來吃。敵愾之歌  路爾鈺　　不信山高，　　不信路遠，　　不信我們這一羣，　　爬不上這峯巔。　　不信艱難，　　不信困苦，　　不信我們的勇氣，　　剷除不掉荊棘的路。　　不信槍砲，　　不信威嚇，　　不信我們激昂的民氣，　　閧不走強敵！　　不信美滿的國家，　　不建築於大眾的熱血！科學小問題熱水瓶裏的水怎不容易冷掉？  子系　　只要用過熱水瓶的人，誰都知道熱水瓶是不容易把所盛的熱水冷掉。在我未把這理由說明之前，先來講幾句關係熱的話：熱原是一種力量，它在宇宙裏，永遠不會消滅的，不過它總是從溫度高的物質裏跑到較低的物質裏去，在這裏有國徽，對流，蒸發，傳導四種散熱的方式。我們明白了這種失熱的原因之後，再來察看這熱水瓶的構造：一個熱水瓶可分二部：一部是玻璃製成的瓶胎，一部是用金屬做的瓶殼。瓶胎是用一種雙層玻璃壁的玻璃瓶，而且裏冇是有一層空隙，空隙間兩層相對的玻璃壁上鍍著一層銀。當瓶胎初製好的時候，用一種含銀的溶液灌到這空隙裏面去，等到銀澱積存在這兩層的玻璃面上的時候，再把剩餘的倒出來，然後再用抽氣機把這空隙裏的空氣完全抽出，使裏面完全成為沒有空氣的真空。末了將抽氣的口封閉。至於外面的瓶殼，那原是在保護瓶胎及便於携取罷了。熱水瓶裏的水，所以能不容易冷掉，因為真空能阻熱的傳導；輻射熱又被玻璃壁上的銀層反射回來；瓶口有木塞，更不能起對流及蒸發作用。有了這幾種原因，熱水瓶裏的熱水不易冷掉，自然也可瞭然了。世界有名的東西  董遍　　（一）大西洋北部的冰山　　（三）荷蘭的風車磨坊　　（五）非洲的黑人　　（七）非洲的象　　（九）南非聯邦的黃金　　（十一）非洲的象牙　　（十三）非洲的駝鳥　　（十五）阿刺伯的馬　　（十七）錫蘭的茶　　（十九）澳洲的綿羊　　（二一）南洋羣島的椰林　　（二三）亞洲的喜馬拉雅山　　（二五）北極海的鯨　　（二七）西比利亞的獸　　　（二九）西比利亞鐵道　　（三一）日本的水産物　　（三三）阿拉斯加的青狐　　（三五）印弟安人的圖騰棒　　（三七）美國紐約的帝國大厦　　（三九）加利福尼亞的大樹　　（樹根中間的孔穴，汽車可以通過）　　（四一）北美的密西西比河　　（四三）巴西的咖啡　　（二）英國的汽船　　（四）法國巴黎的鐵塔　　（六）非洲的麒麟（長頸鹿）　　（八）非洲的猩猩　　（十）南非聯邦的金石　　（十二）非洲的獅子　　（十四）埃及的金字塔，獅身人首像　　（十六）印度的米稻　　（十八）澳洲的袋鼠　　（二十）南洋羣島的土人　　（二二）印度支那半島的老虎　　（二四）德國的飛船　　（二六）北極的白熊　　（二八）西比利亞的馴鹿　　（三十）中國的長城　　（三二）白令海的膃肭獸　　（三四）北美的愛司基摩人　　（三六）尼亞加那的瀑布　　（三八）美國的汽車　　（四十）墨西哥的仙人掌　　（四二）南美阿馬生河的鱷魚　　（四四）南極洲的企鵝世界名物啚孝（一）  海　　在十八世紀初年，俄羅斯的軍隊中有一位大佐，不知怎樣得罪了那狂暴無道的皇帝保羅一世，被放逐到西伯利亞去。俄羅斯政府本來是專制非常的，倘有人被認為有害於國家的，往往送到那很冷很遠的西伯利亞，過那冰天雪地中的苦生活。凡是普通的罪犯，身上都鎖著鐵鍊，鋃鐺出發，到那邊的鑛中去做苦工；至於一般政治犯，却許可和他們的家屬一同前去，由政府每禮拜給生活的費用，要是不夠的話，那麽由他們自己去找尋工作，如打獵或耕種等等，好賺一些額外的工資，可是行動不能自由，甚麽都有人監視着，真好像，籠中的鳥一樣。　　勞卜洛夫大佐是被判為終身放逐的，到了西伯利亞以後，奉命住在西京城土巴爾斯克北面極遠的依吉村中，每天只得到十古貝的生活費。他的夫人和一個三歲的女兒柏絲可菲，跟隨着同去，他夫人很忍耐的受這環境的支配，先前一切的家事，都由下人們擔任的，如今却不得不親自動手，不辭勞苦的幹着。小柏絲可菲漸漸地長大起來，不但幫助伊的母親，並且在村中得到了工作，給農家去收集晚麥，　到一小束的麥作為伊的工資。伊雖住在這荒寒的家中，長年包圍在嚴霜凍雪之中，暗暗的不見天日，然而伊不識不知，天天快樂得很，直到將近十五歲的那年，才開始明白伊的父親是被放在外，感受着非常的苦痛。大佐曾進了一張狀紙給西伯利亞的總督要求特赦回去。這狀紙是由一位官員代為送去，並且答應盡力的替他說情，於是每見有使者從土巴爾斯克來到時，他總是分外的興奮，分外的不安定。然而他一天天的盼望着，却是一天天的失望，因此他當着女兒跟前，再也不能放出一張愉快的面　來了，他老是怨恨着自己的命運太壞，沒有翻身的日子，眼着愛女長大起來，還是沒有教育受，成日的勞動着一雙手，像奴隸一般工作着。　　大佐的失望與怨恨，頓時把小柏絲可菲的童年的快樂打破了。伊天天祈禱着使父親安然的回到家鄉去，脫離這苦痛的放逐生活，有一天在禱告完畢之後，伊的小小心坎中，忽像閃電一般，霍的一亮，起了一個新的志願，伊願意親自到彼得堡去，替父親要求特赦。從此以後，伊往往獨自走到松林裏去夢想這志願的實現，伊又祈禱着上帝，給與伊勇氣和毅力，好去幹　偉大的工作，就是使伊父親免罪回去。但是伊心中雖有這個計劃，却始終不敢說出口來，曾有幾次想要求父親允許伊往彼得堡去，可是話兒已到了嘴唇上，偏又縮回去了，掙扎了一會，又覺得自己不能不說。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊星期文學會集體創作和集體批評  文槐　　　文學作品，不僅在根本上是人類集團生活的產物；就是從藝術的完成一點上說來，它也不是自來就是為作家個人創作出來的。文學作家之具有獨立存在的姿態而出現於人間的事情，文學作品之成爲作家個人的私產的事情，可說是在私有社會產生以後；更嚴格一點說，則是在近代個人主義社會出現以後。在古代，人類過着集團生活，根本就沒有什麽專門的作家，那時的詩歌，戲劇，神話故事等都是人類在集體的勞動中產生出來的。如原始歌謠，戲劇，跳舞等，都是集體創作的藝術。就在私有社會出現的時代，如在奴隸社會和封建社會的時代，因爲人類社會的分工還不怎樣細密，獨立地以創作文學作品爲生活的作家，也還未能普遍地存在，所以，那時有許多偉大的文學作品也還是集體的創作。如我們的「詩經」，雖然曾經孔子「刪」過，但它的作者　不是什麼作家，而是一般民衆，是社會各階層的人羣。又如西洋最古的詩作：「伊里亞德」和「奧狄賽，雖然許多文學史家都說是　馬作的，但在一八九五年德國學者瓦爾夫却提出意見，「認爲詩並非一作家所寫，它們是集體創作的成果，由口傳下來的特羅伊戰爭事件之個別詩歌組成的，僅到了紀元前六世紀才因雅典暴君卑絲司特拉德之命令而被釐定寫就的（見柯根敎授著「世界文學史綱」）。這種說法雖然未必可靠，但就那兩大詩作的出現時代和其筆調的不完全一致之點看來，它們不是老盲人荷馬一人單獨作成的，這却是沒有什麽疑問。及至近代，由於產業的發展，人類分工的日益細密，個人主義的發達，思想，技能之隨着物質而商品化，所以便有了專以創作文學作品爲畢生事業的作家，而一切文學作品當然也就成爲作家個人的私產了。如像「浮士德」那樣長的詩作，如像二十巨冊的小說「羅貢·馬格爾叢書，都是一個作家作成的。這時候，文學界所高唱的是「個性的尊重」，「天才的獨創」，「獨特的風格」，獨特的見地　等等，所謂集體創作以及集體批評，那已成爲被人嘲弄的語句了。　　然而，隨着近代社會的崩潰，到現在個人主義已在日益沒落了，表現集體生活並從事集體創作的精神，便爲另一部分新的作家所重視了。當然，這兒所說的集體創作，不必一定是指那由許多作家共同來完成的作品而說的；我們以爲由許多作家共同蒐集材料，共同討論作品的主題和表現方法，乃至分工合作地來共同寫作，這自然算是集體創作；但在集體的意志和行動之下產生出來的作品，也應該說是集體的產物。如一羣作家在共同的認識下組織起來，經常對論當前應該採取的創作態度，應該以那種社會生活為主要的題材，甚至研究應該如何表現，這樣互　提供意見和材料，一致向着共同的方向努力而產生出來的作品，便可說是集體創作。當前我們進步的文學集團的各個作家的創作生活，便當是集體的創作生活；而這種創作生活實是每一個進步作家所當重視的　　我們可以想到，當着這樣的集體創作的問題提出來時，必會發生兩個問題：第一，在這樣的集體創作之下，是否會妨害作家的創作自由？第二，由這樣的集體創作產生出來的作品，是否會成爲「千篇一律」？現在，爲了使問題更加明顯，我們且分別來回答這兩個問題吧。　　首先是創作自由的問題。我們以爲這一問題是要由作家的主觀認識和生活經騐是否和他所參加的集體創作一致來决定。假使兩者是相矛盾的，那便會要眞的妨害他的創作自由，眞的束縛他的藝術才能的發展；反之，假使兩者是一致的，那作家的參加集體創作，便是「正合本意」，不僅不會妨害他的創作自由，而且還可使他更自由地從事創作，更自由地發展他的創作才能。比如，在目前我們提出「國防文學」的口號，團集全國有民族意識的作家，來展開文學界的救亡運動，並希望作家們能在這下面來參加集團創作，使文學這武器能在救亡運動中發生偉大的作用。在此情形下，某一作家，如果他本身具有進步的民族意識，他意識地願將他的才能和精力供獻於救亡運動，而且他在實際上又是參加救亡運動的，那麽，他在「國防文學」的口號下，與另一羣和他相似的作家努力從事集體創作，便不致妨害他的創作自由；因爲那樣的事情正是他歡喜做的。反之，如有一位具有與殷汝耕同意識的作家，那要他以怎樣的手法來寫爲民族解放的文學，來努力從事這樣的集體創作，便會眞的妨害也他的創作自由了。　　其次，是所謂「千篇一律」的問題。我想，假使集體的創作不僅有一般的原則的規定，而且還要命令作家必須以怎樣死板的公式來創作，甚至還要命令他們必須用怎樣的形容詞和動詞，必須用怎樣的字句來表現，那結果便是千篇一律」了。但事實上恐怕不曾有而且不會有那麼愚蠢的事情吧。我們所說的集體創作，是集合一羣認識相同（或對於某一問題認識相同）的作家，提出一致認可的創作方針，規定主要的題材，採用怎樣的創作方法，來努力集體的工作。這樣，每一個作家在這集體的創作生活中，都可以表現出客觀事物之一面，都可以表現出他們特殊的生活經騐和藝術才能乃至其個性，結果，所產生的作品當然就不是「千篇一律」，而是在統一的原則下的多樣的創作了。如巴比塞，羅曼羅蘭，紀德，他們便是過着集體的創作生活的，而且他們也都用現實主義的創作方法來寫作反戰文學，但他們的反戰作品却並不「千篇一律」！　　同時，就是狹義的集體創作，卽集合幾位作家共同來創作一個作品的事情，也並不是絕對不可能的。不過，從事這樣集體創作的作家不僅要認識相同，而且還須是藝術才能不要相差太遠，作風有很大的類似的才行，因爲如若不然，那共同產生出來的劍作，在表現方面便不能得到一致。我以爲在目前，如果有認識相同，作風類似的有才能的一些作家，共同來有計劃地創作一個巨大的作品，那一定是頗有意義的，雖然初次的嘗試未見得能成功。我們在目前的出版界中，常可以看到二人或幾人合著的理論著作，但那樣的文學作品却是不可多見，這原因也許是在於一同創作文學作品的事情更爲困難吧。　　現在應該而且可能急於實行的集團創作，我以爲是指出一種或多種主要的社會現象爲題材，要求某些認識相同的作家一齊來創作，以出版某種創作叢書或某種創作集；如關於描寫農村或工人生活的，關於民族解放運動的，在目前都屬必需，都當馬上幹起來。　　總之，目前的時代已經是個人主義沒落，集團主義興起的時代了。進步的作家應該去過集體的創作生活，從事集體的創作，表現集團的生活，不應做個人主義的遊魂。在集體的創作生活中，不僅可以增長個人的生活知識和創作經騐，而且因之還可以增强個人對集團對社會的作用。所以，我們說，集體創作，像上述今天浙江大戲院開映之報仇雪恨</p>

<p>那樣的集體創作，對於進步的作家不僅是可能做的事情，而且是必須做的事情。　　至於集體批評，其歷史意義也和集體創作一　，　　　必多爲　說，　在必要　　的，是進步的批評家也當和進步的作家一樣，在一致認可的綱領下，集體地努力工作。因爲批評的任務是將作品的藝術的語言翻譯成爲社會學的語言，不必要生動的描寫，所以集體批評的　　較　　創作爲容易　現在我們可以做的　是集合一些認識在根本上相同的批評家，對於某一種重要作品，或某個作家，或某種文學的出版物，進行集體批評；這是可以藉着各種座談會的形式，或一同用文字發表意見的形式來表現的。在這中間，一方面自然可以免除一二批評家的獨斷，可以免除公式主義的橫行，因而也更能給作家提供一些創作意見，甚至指導作家創作；另一方面也可以增長批評家的批評知識，使批評日益進步。　　最後我們還要說：這樣集體創作的發展，必會使集體批評的題材和內容更加豐富；集體批評的努力也必會使集體創作日益進步。兩者實是互有益處，並不能分開來談的。外埠郵政代辦所理敎的秘密  望風　　齊齊哈爾通訊　　旅居齊齊哈爾將近半年了，還沒有給申報寫過一篇文章，這一半是因爲懶於執筆，但一半也因爲要說的話太多了，反覺得「有一部二十四史不知從何處說起」之苦。現在我就把我所知道的關於理敎在東北的情形，大概叙述一下罷。　　「理敎」—俗稱「在理」—的勢力在東北，不下於「在家理」的勢力之亦長江流域。東北任何地方的下級層里，「理敎都有很嚴密的組織。道」潛在的力量實在是不容忽視的。　　「理敎」由內地發展到東北，據說已經有五十年的歷史了。原因是在內地受到了當時中國滿淸政府的打擊，想到那統治力量較爲鬆懈一些的邊陲地區去開闢新天地。中間又經過了幾十年的奮鬥，才得到了半公開的活動。　　「理敎」可說是明末淸初「哥老會」的支流。牠的起源是含有民族意識的「復明滅滿」的革命的秘密組織。可是到後來，「在家理」被聰明的中國淸室統治者所收買了，變成了「安淸邦」；同樣「理敎」也遭了同一的命運，所以現在「在理」也稱「在淸理」的。中國順治皇帝却被現在「理敎」尊爲了鼻祖；據「理敎」傳出的敎史上解說，順治出家後是「南海老佛爺」—卽「觀音—收的第一個弟子。這也就是「理敎」由「仙人手中傳到人間的開始。　　「理敎」以「南海聖宗—卽「觀音菩薩」—爲最高的崇拜偶像；以烟酒爲敎徒的戒條；入敎經過舊敎徒介紹後，並沒有什麼森嚴的規約，不過僅以封建社會的倫理觀念的「信義」，來維持着敎徒間的相互關係罷了。　　組織的細胞，以敎徒個人爲單位，採純白由主義。最高領袖爲「領正」—俗呼「當家的」或「大爺」—，但敎徒對「領正」並不負什麽實際責任，不過是一種「道義」上的崇敬而已。「領正」所以能得到敎徒的「捧」—擁護的意思—，惟一所恃的即是歷史關係，第一，作領正的必須「年高德劭」。個人道德有修養，過獨身生活，而經過「領法」的手續尤爲重要。　　「　正」與「領正」間是絕對平等的，當中並沒有什麼「門戶」派別之分，這可說是、「理敎」組織上的一個特點。在北政府時代，曾對「理敎」很加重視，當時在北京　「全國戒烟酒總會」的最高組織，刊行「理鐸報」，全國各地的公所」都改爲了「某某地方戒烟酒公所」。可是後來因政府對於國家大事　處理不暇，對道一「民間」的事務也就無所與聞了。現在，作爲「理敎一根據地的東北已轉入他人之手；「理敎」在國內也大有日就式微的趨勢，這種最高的組織是更談不到了。　　理敎徒間都互稱爲「八方爺」，這種稱呼的來源，大槪是當時滿淸入關以後，一些有氣節的明朝臣民都不甘心做亡國奴，但爲統治者的勢力所迫，只有漂泊「八方」做流民了，而同時在他們中間又保持着相當的秘密組織，「八方爺」的稱呼或者就是同感身世漂泊的同志的意思罷。　　「公所」是「八方爺」們相互間聯絡的機關。有某某堂號的標榜，但他們這中間並沒有像「在家理」有自相鬥爭的事情發生。這一個公所的「八方爺」可以到那一個公所去「捧日子」。　　「八方爺」間很有互助的精神，當一位「八方爺」從遠方而來，如果感到了物質上的困難，可到這一地方的「公所」去求助，按着敎中的規節盤詰之後，就可以得到該地的「八方爺」們醵資援助。　　「公所」的支持者是地方上的「衆拯辦」，這些人們大都是地方上的「光棍」！南方稱流氓—，他們依這一團體的秘密組織，與地方上的政治軍事勢力相勾結—舊東北政權時代，所有中下級軍官多爲理敎徒—，營「非法生活」，如衆賭佃頭，販賣毒品，包攬詞訟，通匪說項等，而所有「公所」的經濟來源也就出在這些人們身上。　　「八方爺」集會的日期是在每月舊歷「初一」與「十五」，或其他理敎特殊紀念日。這種集會呌做「擺齋」或「擺日子」或「作日子」，當中又分「順齋」與「公齋」二種。「順齋」較爲簡單，只有一夜就結束了；新敎徒經介紹後，出少許「香資」卽可舉行入敎的儀式，舊敎徒　可隨意來「朝佛」「求順」。　　「公齋」的儀式就複雜了，期間須經過三夜，「領正」在這三天內，不分晝夜的須坐在「壇」上，不可下來；這在一個沒有修養的「領正」是辦不到的。新敎徒如在「公齋」日子入敎，香資較重，舊敎徒也得捐欵，因爲這幾天中大家要在公所吃喝居住，開銷是非常大的。　　「新敎徒」入敎手續，除了介紹人外，尚有「求師」和「引師」，儀式很隆重。當你沒有正式「授理」的時候，內中秘密决不准窺探，「攩宗」負有衛護敎中秘密的責任，在領正「點理」的　候，他們都出動在公所左右巡察，以防敎外的人們竊進。新敎徒經過履歷的登記，「　　」在各壇前替你　求入敎，經過所　「護　」的　　徒的允許，「引師」才能卜壇來引你　。在門坎間又經過「引師」的嚴密盤查，才能引入壇前，向「領正」跪卜來聽取「點理」。這時候「領正」始以「五字眞言」，用很嚴重的態度和低微的聲音傳授給你，末了還以「尊敬長上」「和睦鄉鄰」等話來勗勉你。　　女敎徒—稱「二衆」或「坤理」，因爲男子又稱「大衆」—入敎手續更爲複雜，除了所有經過和男子相同外，「點理」的時候，壇上用具必須都加改換，而且女敎徒和「領正」不能見面，中問須隔着一條靑色障幔。　　入敎後因為病或不謹慎，吃了烟酒或「五字眞言」吳出於口，呌做「破大碗」，必須經過「領正」「重點」，才算恢復入敎，不過手續很簡單。　　「理敎」中行禮呌「下參」，比普　跪拜較難，必須經過相當的練習，才能應合身手。所以看見了「八方爺」的「下參」，就知道他的在理的資格了。　　敎徒的進階呌做「得法」；法是用來區分敎徒間的階級的，但這中間并沒有具體的權利表示。「得法」須以在敎內的功績和歷史爲標凖。「法」由「領正」授與，多爲梵音的咒語，因堂號的分別，各有不同。「帮正法」以下有「催宗法，「　宗法」，「承辦法」，「文武辦道法」等。授普通「法」的儀式，在「順齋」或「公齋」的日子就可舉行了　　　法　　　　　複雜鄭重　因爲不惟「帮正」僅次「領正」一位，必要的時候，「帮正」還可代替「領正」升壇呢。　　這一潛在的神秘勢力，散佈在東北的任何一個角落裏，取着半公開的方式在活動着。因為它以佛敎為標榜，以封建社會的倫理觀念為哲學，取得了東北思想落後農民的信仰，所以在所有的縣份和農村內都有很大的支配力量。理敎的發展，除了「領正」支取最低生活費之外，可謂純爲「宜揚道義」，對民衆利益幷沒有什麽損害，所以任何力最想要消滅它是很難收效的。過去在東北，什麽「道德會」，「同善社」，「收緣道」等類似的組織都想取而代之，但結果都告失敗。　　這一支不可衊視的力量，在九一八事變後也爲僞國所垂靑了。他們知道要消滅它不如利用它；由僞國中央政府出面，在「新京」組織了一個「理敎總會」，把所有東北的「理敎」和「在家理」的領袖都網羅在一起，幷支給很厚的薪金，使他們指使着他們的黨徒，做着出賣祖國的間諜偵探暗殺等工作。現在東北各地的「公所」也都附設了「香堂」，和「在家理」正式合流了。　　可否把這一抱有民族意識初衷的民間力量，糾正成爲一種民族解放的力量呢？東北的義勇軍正在做着嘗試，幷且得到了相當的成功。「理敎」依附的存在關係主要的是封建勢力　　封建罰度總崩潰以後，這一封建的黏附物自然也就隨着消滅了。生活水手  謝敷禮　　在起始我就得肯定地向讀者們說：水手生活，確是一椿非常辛苦的工作呢！我們不但要有着强健而有力的體魄，膽大而活潑的動作，並且還要有耐勞受苦的精神，這樣方始可說具備了作一個水手的最低的基本條件。不論在寒冬盛暑，每天當東方還只些微的呈現着魚白色的辰光，我們一天的工作就已在開始了。　　當早晨舵樓上的大鐘敲了四下（註一），我們知道已經是六點鐘了，每天第一椿的工作就是洗滌船內各層的台甲（註二）。那時候我們每人都各拿了一把掃帚，二頭目拿着放水的皮帶，從水管里接通了海水，他就拿了皮帶龍頭向台甲各處沖，我們就拿了硬掃帚向着台甲各處掃了。這樣由項高的一層洗滌起，直到最低的一層爲止，從船頭至船尾都洗刷完了，再把各個厠所也冲洗潔凈，那時候大約已可到八點鐘了，於是我們就停止一小時，這辰光是給我們洗臉同吃早餐用的，以後要到九點鐘才再工作呢。　　大鐘鐺鐺地敲了二下，是九點鐘啦。我們的大頭目就跑到大副處去問來了今天應做的工作，有時也許大副早已指派給他了，所以我們做的工作大都是再由大頭目來指派給我們的。　　水手們應做的工作眞是繁雜得很呢；可說船內一切的事都要做的。到船開船下錨解纜，這是本分應做的事。倘若船在海洋里行駛，我們大都做船里內部的工作　如：敲各處鐵板上的鐵銹啦，修補油布蓬帳啦，各處油漆啦，磨地板啦，接鐵絲繩啦，…。一到船在港內停泊了，那我們便大多做外部的工作了，如：敲船壳外的銹鐵啦，油漆船桅烟囪或船壳啦，有時在裝貨還要不時的替他們換鐵絲繩同滑車盤啦。我們每天的工作總以油漆同敲鐵銹居多，所以我們穿在身上的衣服盡是些斑斑的漆跡，有時竟可說一天到晚一手提了漆桶，一手傘了漆帚在漆。這樣從上午九點鐘起，除中午得停止一小時來用午餐外，直要做到下午五點鐘方停呢。但是過了五點鐘，以後也不可說完全是我們休息的時間了，往住船在海洋里行駛，晚</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>上忽然的下霧，下雪，或者起大風了，這樣我們隨時有被大副喊去作各種臨時緊急工作的可能。下重霧或者下大雪，我們就起碼要一個人起來値更，站在船頭上暸遠，有什麽所見，立刻就要敲鐘報告，通知舵樓上的値班人大副或二副注意。這意外的臨時工作，直要做到天氣淸朗時爲止。在値更中我們是不可有些微的偸懶的，水手多的話，每個人値一個鐘點，少的話，就得値二個鐘點呢。這種値更工作大多在嚴寒的冬天居多，我們站在四無遮蔽的船頭上，身上穿了雨衣，戴了雨帽，浪花打在身上，混身都是水了，再加冷得像刀割般的海風吹向你的臉上來，有時竟會被吹得透不過氣來。還有下重霧天要時常測海底的深淺，冷天裏我們從海水裏拉上來的細鉛絲繩，盡是些結了冰的冰條，也往往會把我們的兩只手凍冷得麻木而失去知覺。　　我們這般的每天勞苦工作，一月來所得的酬報大多都不滿二十元呢。在公司的定規，我們水手的薪金一律都是廿八元，但是一到了我們的手裏，何以最多祇不過二十元呢？這其間是因爲經過了大頭目一層剝削的緣故啊！我們的薪工是由大頭目來定的，大多在十幾元至二十元之間，因爲我們的生意都是由大頭目來推薦的，所以他有剝削我們薪工的權利。我們因爲生意是由他來推薦的，所以在無意中這剝削也默許成爲一種慣例了。並且他還有停削我們生意的特權呢，他要停削我們生意，也無須得到船長或大副的許可。所以做了一個船里的水手頭目，在我們看起來，眞也可說顯赫得非凡呢，因爲全船上的水手，瓜得買司（卽舵工），木匠，都是歸他來管的。瓜得買司同木匠的薪工較水手大，大約有三十二元，一只船里有八個水手，四個瓜得買司，一個木匠的話，那末水手頭目所管理的人就有十三個人，少說些，每個人由他剝削五塊錢一個，那末他這意外的收獲就每月有六十多元之多，再加上他自己應得的薪工三十多元，不是每月也有百來塊錢一月嗎？倘若輪船水路走得好一些，燥包貨（註四）再多些，水手頭目的進賬眞個還要多呢。所以水手頭目討娶了大小老婆的也很多。　　（註一）船上敲鐘記數不與岸上相同，最多祗敲八記爲度，卽一點鐘敲二記，一點半則敲三記，二點鐘敲四記，二點半敲五記，三點敲六記，三點半敲七記，四點敲八記，四點半則又如半點敲一記，五點鐘敲二記，六點鐘則敲四記，餘可類推。　　（註二）艙面的甲板。　　（註三）水手們所帶的偸漏水脚貨件。時事研究比國宣布中立與歐洲局勢  曉聲　　比利時，說來只不過是個蕞爾小國。它的國土只有三萬餘平方啟羅米突之大，人口也只有七百四五十萬人，比較起英法德意等列强來，眞可說是渺乎小也！但因爲它介在法德荷蘭與英國之間，在地理上佔着很重要的位置，所以，在歐洲局勢的變動中它實是擔負着重大責任的。　　由於地理的關係，歐洲列强爲要緩和它們間的直接衝突，一向就是維持比國的中立地位的。遠在十八世紀，法荷·法奧均曾先後成立協定，承認比利時爲中立地帶。及至十九世紀的四十年代，比國離荷蘭獨立後，英法普俄奧等國更正式保證其永久中立，並逼使荷蘭承認之。自此以後，數十年來比國均未曾遭受戰禍：待到上次大戰爆發時，由於德軍的進攻，這永久中立的小國才捲入了歐洲列强爭鬥的漩渦。戰後爲了防禦德國的報仇，爲了自己的安全，比國曾與法國站在同一戰綫上，對於歐洲的安全起着積極的作用。這時它是凡爾賽和約的一個重要保護者，是國際聯盟的基本會員國，是諾加羅公約的簽字者，對於歐洲和平的維持，它實擔負的有重汰的義務。但是，日前比王利奧波德親自主持內閣會議，宣言恢復比國的中立地位了，這種突如其來的表示，若只從地理和歷史上去考究，自然毫不足怪，但若由目前歐洲的政治形勢方面看來，那却是値得我們特別注意的問題。　　先就比國宣布中立的動機來說，這就與過去它的保持中立有根本的不同。十八九世紀時代比國的中立，是歐洲列强爲了緩和它們間的直接衝突，爲了維持歐洲的均勢而使然的。現在比國的宣布恢復中立地位，則是由它在內在外的壓力之下而表現出來的。這我們可以依據目前的客觀形勢作一個大要的說明。　　原來比國有兩大民族：在南部的爲拉丁族的華倫人，在北部的爲條頓族的佛來明人。前者不僅面貌與法國人有些類以，講法國話，而且在外交政策上也主張親法：後者則不同，他們　似荷蘭人，操荷蘭語，對於比國的親法外交也是一向就反對的。上次大戰以後，在凡爾賽條約之下，此國和法國不僅獲得了許多勝利品，而且可以從各方面控制德國，使其不能作破壞和平的舉動，同時法國也就掌握了歐陸的覇權。因此，戰後十餘年來比國親法派都在有利的外交形勢下，在國內佔着絕對的優勢。但最近的情形可有些不同了，由於希特勒之不顧一切地撕碎了凡爾賽和諾加羅條約，由於莫梭里尼的武力吞併阿比西尼亞，更由於英法的外交政策在許多地方都未能一致，使一部分比利時的人民都感到了國聯的無力，國際條約的沒有作用，而幻想跳出歐洲列强的紛爭圈外，以圖自保。同時，本年五月比國又新出現了一個與希特勒通氣的里克斯黨，這使比國左右兩極端的鬥爭也日益尖銳起來。在這鬥爭中，里克斯黨和其他的保守份子更迎合佛來明人的反對親法傾向，宣傳法蘇互助公約的成立，在德俄發生戰爭時，法軍將會通過比國以攻德，因而使比利時受到戰禍，並說在法蘇集團和德意集國的對立下，比國現處地位甚爲危險，以圖使比國離開和平戰綫，而作單獨的自利打算。於是，反對親法，恢復中立的論調抬頭，迫使比王和現內閣不得不宣言比國恢復中立了。依據這個分析，我們可見這次比國的宣布中立，實是在歐洲和平受到嚴重的威脅之下，在國內情形的變化之下產生出來的。　　復次是比國恢復中立地位對於歐洲局勢的影嚮。我們已經指出，戰後的比利時對於歐洲安全與和平是起着積極作用的，這與百年前的比國所處地位比較起來，可說完全不同。因此，它現在的突然宣布中立，不僅不能維持歐洲均勢，保障和平，反之，對於歐洲的均勢和集體安全，倒是一個嚴重的破壞和打擊。雖然比國曾聲明無意退出國聯，仍願繼續遵守國際義務，而且對於法比軍事同盟並不宣告廢止，亦不否認諾加羅公約，但有實際上比國已宣布中立，除擴張軍備保衛自身外，對於鄰國的安全，對於歐洲和平，不願擔負任何責任與義務，是則那些聲明與表示還有什麽用處呢？在這樣的情形下，願意維持現狀的法國當然要大感不安，因爲比利時原是　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>法國的多年友好，現在它突然宣布中立，這在客觀上實無異離開自己而結好敵人，雖然比國的表示乃是由德意的威脅歐洲和平而使然的，但這結果不僅不能保持歐洲和平，阻止德意侵略野心的發展，而且是火上加油，將會使希特勒無西顧之憂，更行努力向東邁進，以進攻法蘇集團，破壞世界和平。因此，當比國宣布中立的消息傳出後，小協約國卽認爲集體安全基礎已爲動搖，只有柏林羅馬表示好感，倫敦則默然不語。單就這些情形，我們也可充分看出比國的宣布中立與歐洲列强的關係了。　　至於比國本身的命運，我以爲是要由它內政的變化來决定的。如果在比國左右兩極端的鬥爭中，里克斯黨與保守派獲得勝利，那不僅會使比國放棄它對於保護歐洲和平所負的義務，而且會將比國人民引去跟隨希特勒，更積極地破壞世界和平。如果現狀不發生根本的大變動，那比國眞正中立也難保持。因爲地理的關係，只要歐洲各大國間一發生戰爭，比利時卽會不可避免地遭到戰禍。一九一四年的比國不是中立的嗎？但大戰發生，德軍首先就向它攻打。現在情形雖與過去不同，但比國的地理關係並未變更，無論在英法德意之間，只要一發生戰爭，它都無法跳出於戰爭漩渦之外。所以，比國這次的宣布中立，對於它自身，除了在遭受攻擊時拒絕他人援助外，別無什麽意義。要使比國眞正得到和平，並積極擔負起維持世界和平的責任，那只有眞正的和平主義者在比國得到勝利後才行。　　現在的世界，已分爲了眞正的和平主義者與實際上破壞和平者的兩大集團，這兩大集團的决鬥現刻正在西班牙在法國，也在比利時表演：而比國這次的宣布中立和這以後的一切表現，就是這决鬥表演的一個重要節目，所以應該把它大大地書寫在近代的歷史中去的。哲學講座乞丐的夢  吉華　　我們幷沒有看見過鬼，但我們可以想像出鬼來；我們也幷未看見過龍，妖怪，但我們在神怪小說上也看到許多描寫龍和妖怪的事情。那麽，在我們人類的頭腦中，似乎就可以自由捏造擬畫出許許多多的未經證實，而實際又在客觀上幷不存在的東西了。還有，一個窮苦的人可以幻想許多富有者高貴的生活，更進一步，也可以夢想極樂的天國，奇怪的世界，在一頃刻之間，他的意識，心靈，可以從天邊想到海底，從窮愁潦倒想到驕奢淫逸。這樣看來，我們的腦子似乎是可以隨意地馳騁，想，决不受任何拘束的。　　歷來的大科學家，大哲學家，大政治家，他們在平時都具有一些與常人不同，而在現實世界中又未經人道及的許多理想，例如柏拉圖，他的腦子裏面便懷着一個美滿的「理想國」，在無綫電還未發明以前，馬可尼便理想到那不用電綫都可以傳電的人所未知的無綫電，諸如此類，都似乎是這些大思想家自由地在腦子裏想出來的一樣。在他們還未把他們的理想做成事實之先，一般人大概都斥他爲幻想，爲異端，如哥倫布，如蓋列雷，都受到過當時保守派極力的反對。但是一到他們的理論或爲事實時，那有些人却又說道是他們天才的自由意志的結果了。　　還有，那些絕對的自由主義者也是一標。比如盧梭，他認爲人一生下地來便是絕對自由的，不受任何拘束，所以他主張「天賦人權」「自由平等」之說。現在的安那其主義者也是一樣，他們主張個個人都應絕對地自由，不要政府，不要社會。他們以爲個人的行動，由於其意志之自由，是可以絕對自由的。這便是把自由意志運用到行爲上面來了。似乎人們想做甚麽就可以而且可能去做甚麽一樣。　　但是人們的意志和行爲果眞是絕對自由的嗎？我們不妨先在這裏引述一個通俗的故事。有一個乞丐，他窮得連飯也沒得吃，衣也沒得穿，但他却仍是具有自由的意志，能自由地想像。有一天他倒臥在一個崖洞裏，大概是似睡非睡，似夢非夢的時候，他覺得他已經發了財了，住着高大的洋房，吃着山珍海錯，擁有嬌妻美妾。正在這時，適有强盜來搶刦他，他便勇敢地用武器去追擊。但砰的一聲，他的沙鍋已被他那手中的竹棍打得粉碎了。這下他才驚醒了轉來，才發見他是在那裏做夢。原來他仍是一個乞丐，决不是一個富翁。這樣看來，意志倒似乎自由，但行爲却還是不自由的了。　　再進一步說，意志也未必就絕對自由。乞丐固然可以恣意地胡思亂想，但是如果他沒有看見過高大的洋房，他又能絕對自由地在腦子裏揑造一個洋房出來不成？正等於那從未看見過鬼怪的人，而他所描寫和繪畫出或想像出的鬼怪，總是蛇身哪，馬首哪，紅頭髮，綠眼睛，張牙舞爪的樣子，决不能想出一個一點也不類似客觀事物的鬼怪出來。所以意識之能自由想像，還是想像那他所經騐過的東西，或所經騐過的各種東西之嵌合物。這樣看來，說人們能有絕對的自由意志是不對的。　　那些大思想家，他能照他的理想來發明一件東西，來構造一個社會，主張一種在社會上有其廣大作用的學說，但那樣的理想，必定要與實際的世界和社會相關切，相適合才行。因為烏托邦這一理想國，不怕理想得如何完善，都是不能實現的，而且在具有構成烏托邦這一理想國的意志的人，他也如那描畫鬼怪的人把實際世界中的各種事物擇取割裂而嵌合成爲一種東西一樣，也决不是他的絕對自由的理想。要理想之能成爲事實，那這理想必須是根據客觀事物之發展規律而製成的理想，亦卽是說這種理想的自由，是以客觀事物之必然的法則爲其條件。　　原來客觀世界都是有因果法　可尋的。世界中是有因果法則的網交互錯綜地滿佈着的，不論那一樁事情，不論那一種物件。人們生在這現實的世界，也處於這交錯的因果法則的網之中，而且人類本身的發展，自身也有其必然法則存在。而人又是自然的和社會的產物，你無論做那樣事情，都應受客觀的自然法則和社會法則的支配和决定。如果自然界根本沒有電氣這種東西，那無綫電也不能發明；卽使有電氣，如果對於電氣的性質以及其流動的法則不知道，也不能發明無綫電，而且要認識電氣之性質和法則，也要一般的科學知識到了某種程度，到了可以發明無綫電，而又用得着無綫電的時候，無綫電才能被發明。這其中就已經有了自然法則和社會法則之支配了。在資本中義社會還未存在之前，在資本主義尙未成熟之前，科學的社會主義是不能被提出的。科學的社會主義是認識了資本主義社會之發展的必然法則的結果。所以人類的意志和行動都要受客觀必然法則的支配。「不是人們意識决定自己的存在，反是自己的社會的存在决定自己的意識。」　　但是這樣說來，人們就完完全全屈服於客觀的冷酷的必然法則之下，被動地受其規定，而一點也沒有自由了嗎？如果把必然也絕對化，那麼我們在社會中便一點用不着去作那改良或改造牠的理想和計劃了，在自然界中便一點也用不着去作那利用牠戰勝牠的理想了。這樣一來，社會還有甚麼進步？人生又有甚麼興味？不是同那「枯木死灰」一樣了嗎？所以人們是有自由的，而且社會之進步也是由於求自由的思想，和思想求自由而來。不過我們所說的自由是有限制的自由，而不是絕對的自由罷了，正等於我們所說的必然幷不是機械的必然，一點也小容許人類有自由存在的必然一樣。　　恩格斯說，「自由是必然的理解，必然只有在未被人理解之時是盲目的。自由不是在於想像中的對於自然法則之獨立，而是在於認識這些法則，而能有計劃地利用牠們來達到一定的目的。」必然，在未被人們認識之前，牠是束縛人類，妨礙人類的行動的，如未認識電氣之性質和法則之前，人們只受電擊之害，而受不到電報，電話，無綫電等之利，但一經人類認識，那客觀的鐵一般冷酷的必然法則，便由「自存之物」（Thing　in　itself）成爲「我們之物」（Tingin　ourselves）了。我們愈是不能理解必然，那我們便愈是不自由。比如未認識電氣的必然法則之前，我們不能自由地打電報，架設收音機，而且常有被觸電而不知解救之危險；一知道後，便多出許多的自由了，可見愈認識了必然，則自由愈多，而自由的程度也愈大。在另一方面，「因此，人對於某一問題的判斷，愈是自由，這個判斷內容的决定，將帶着更大的必然性，相反的，猶豫不决是以無知為基礎。表面上似乎在許多不同的相互矛盾的可能决定中，自由地任擇其一，可是其實牠正是證明自己的不自由，以及自己對於所應該支配的對象之屈服。」這便是必然與自由之統一。　　但是我們也並不因此就說，必然和自由之間就一點距離也沒有。不怕我們認識必然達到怎樣大的程度，我們總不能說自然和社會等客觀事物之必然法則我們已認識無遺，因之，我們所認識出的必然，是瀾次地一天一天在達到正確的必然的途中，一天一天更接近於客觀的必然，因之，我們的自由也是一天一天地更大起來。必然和自由是在對立之下統一起來的。要這樣，自由方有增進，而人類才有進化。　　在哲學上，主張意志自由而反對必然性的人是屬於主觀論的陣營中的人，他們認爲客觀世界都是主觀意議之所產生，故如此主張。另一方面，機械的唯物論者則主張一切都受客觀的必然法則决定，人類也如一種機械的物質　無一點自由。前一種學說，結果當然變成了獨存論，唯我論去了，而被者則也要陷入於定合論和宿命論之中。主張意志自由，則不認識客觀世界之必然法則，因之，愈想自由而結果愈是不自由。主張機械的必然，則聽其必然而不去理解必然，不想把必然轉化成自由，結果也同樣得不到自由。所以把二者辯證地統一起來我們才能由「必然之王國」達到「自由的王國」。科學叢話幾種動物感覺之新的研究  曹適　　每一種動物都必有其生存本能，和適應於這種本能的特別發達的感覺器官。但普通一般所知道的，只是某些動物所有的特別顯明的感覺，如貓的視覺，老鼠的聽覺等；至於這些特別顯明的感覺究竟銳敏到了什麽程度，以及那些特殊的不易爲我們肉眼看出的動物的感覺情形，那不但不易知道，而且是不易考察的。最近有幾位科學家，費盡心血，實騐出了幾種動物的某些感覺情形，這在動物學的研究上，在科畢知識的發展上，不消說都有很重大的意義。因此，特爲分述如次—　　犬的嗅覺和聽覺　誰都知道犬的嗅覺和聽覺都是很銳敏的，但究竟銳敏到了怎樣的程度，這却還沒有人確言過。最近法國巴黎動物研究所所長哈謝，斯普勒氏特別訓練了一條犬敏，只要他有吩咐，該犬卽能完全遵命，如起立，坐下，橫臥，行走以及種種的表情和行動，它都能如命做到。斯普勒氏爲要知道犬的嗅覺究竟銳敏到了什麼程度，便特別將這條犬拿來實騐。他的實騐方法是：在犬的鼻子的周圍，繫縛着一些海綿，以漏斗浸入蟻酸和乳酸等類能發强烈臭味的液體，隨卽命犬橫坐起來。這樣經過幾度的反覆之後，無論這種液體流來與否，該犬都會自動橫坐着。後來斯普勒氏又慢慢地將各種試騐物的臭液分量减去，但不久該犬就好像沒有反應似的。依據這個實騐，斯普勒便斷定過弱的臭味，犬仍是感不到的，即是給與感官刺激還未能達到一定限度的臭味，犬的嗅覺卽不能發生。但是，不管怎樣，犬的嗅覺還是比人類爲優的。至於犬的聽覺，斯普勒氏也實騐過。他曾在一個金屬的盤上置一注水管，使水由管中一點一點地滴落下去，同時命令那隻靈活的犬：一聽到水滴的聲音，卽站立起來（原來是臥着的）。結果證明了犬的聽覺銳敏到了這種程度：卽是人的耳朶所不能聽到的微弱的聲音，犬却能聽到。　　魚有聽覺嗎？一般人都以爲魚沒有相當於耳朶的聽覺器官，從來的許多學者對於魚的聽覺器官雖有許多研究，但結果却沒有正確的報告。據說池中的鯉魚，只要一拍手，卽會浮起來，這似乎是可以證明魚的聽覺；然而，依向來的解說，則是因爲魚體側面有一種側綫，它感到了水的震動，所以才浮起來的。這樣，魚的聽覺問題仍沒有可信的答案。爲此，最近蘇聯佛羅羅夫敎授曾以很巧妙的方法實騐了魚的聽覺。　　敎授的實騐方法是：以輕而柔軟的電綫繫在魚的身上，將它放在小小的水池中，使其自由游泳，同時又將電話的受電機浸入水中：還下才通過接連着魚的電綫，給與它以電擊；結果是魚好像受了很大刺激樣，飛躍起來：這不過是證明魚的觸覺的銳敏，當然還不算實騐的成功。接着敎授又在這樣的幾度試騐之後便停止電擊而嗚電鈴，這樣一來，魚聽到聲音，也如前一樣地飛躍起來；以後敎授又在水上鳴電鈴，結果魚依然顯示出了聽到聲音的樣子。於是，敎授歡躍起來，斷定了魚確是有聽覺的；而一向不曾解决魚是否有聽覺的問題，從此也就有了可靠的答案了。　　我們常聽到釣魚的人說，在釣魚的時候决不可開口說話：這是很有道理的；但這道理一向只是依存於盲目的經騐，並沒有科學的證明；直到佛羅羅夫這個實騐宣告成功，才使這個道理和許多魚有聽覺的說法有了實際的科學依據。　　猿猴等動物能識別顏色　已故鮑布羅夫敎授爲了要知道猿猴是否能識別顏色，曾在一個赤色的盤內放着食物，呌樹上的猿猴來喫，結果猿猴眞的從樹上下來；後來又換個靑色的盤子，猿猴便知道那沒有食物，不再下來了？這就證明了猿猴是能識別顏色的。同時，以同樣的實騐，更知道了貓，魚和土潑鼠等也能識別顏色。　　巴黎動物園長曾在一個圓盤上弄了四個圓孔，並在那些園孔的周圍塗着不同的顏色，然後將圓盤掛起來，使之慢慢旋轉，待到塗有某種顏色的圓孔轉到下端時卽由那個孔口放入食物，這樣來試騐犬是否能識別顏色。結果證明了大也能識別顏色的。　　還有，在中美和南美有一種食蟻獸，這是頭尖，舌頭伸出的喜食螞蟻的奇妙動物。據學者的實騐，這種奇妙的動物也有識別顏色的能力。　　關於實騐食蟻獸是否有識別顏色能力的方法，據我們所知道的是：將各種着色的漏斗顚倒起來，放在地上，又特別在那塗着赤色的漏斗中間放入食蟻獸的食物，經過幾度嘗試之後，食蟻獸便不顧盼赤色漏斗以外的漏竇了；只是兩赤色漏斗之口伸入長舌。這很明顯的，是在經騐中，食蟻獸已將赤色和食物連在一起了，它之特別注意赤色，便是想喫食物；而它的能識別顏色，當然更是用不着說的。　　此外還有一些動物能辨別聲音聽音樂這更是很奇妙而値得硏究的。不過到現在爲止，關於這點還沒有可靠的實騐，所以我們也就無須在道裏特別提出來談論了。特寫流「沙千里」差堪比擬　大陸商塲螞蟻多  徵　　蕭瑟的秋風在近黃昏的南京路上呼呼地吹拂着。那時行人稀少，只看見天空中飄搖着五顏六色的商號旗幟，夾着斷斷續續招徠主顧的無綫電和銅鼓喇叭響聲，使人很分明地看出商塲的戰爭，在這不景氣時期中，也飽含着獨力難支悲呼慘號的意味似的。由三大公司向東，走到著名的大陸商塲附近，却被我遠遠發現了一面白布黑字大橫披，突出在街沿上面，像似浩浩蕩蕩民衆大請願時橫在前鋒的大旗，又像似十六年國民革命軍克復上海時扯在馬路上的大標語。近前一看，恰正是我所要訪問的「蟻社第六屆徵求運動」的露布。由這大旂的指示，我便跨進了大陸商塲電梯，到了四樓四二九號蟻社。還沒有報名而進的時候，我早已聽見門內傳出百餘人合唱的雄壯歌聲，一字一句都可以激發我的情緒。我便暫時在鬥外站着聽，恰巧他們正又從頭唱第二遍道：『螞蟻是愛羣互助的小虫，螞蟻是有集團可織的大衆。我們都是螞蟻，不是吃書無用的蠧虫。在這光明與黑暗决鬥的戰壕中，我們要向前衝！（重一句）前衝，前衝，（重兩句）我們都要前衝！用螞蟻的精神來播植新文化的種，使新世界的光明更加燦爛鮮紅！起來，起來，螞蟻們！大家起來，螞蟻們！向前去做自由平等（重一句）的先鋒！」那嘹亮發揚的音響，齊整一致的節拍，使我聽了好像置身在大軍進行的部隊中；又像乘風破浪，在怒潮如獅子吼聲中同舟共濟。直等他們遍兩遍唱過了暫時沈默下來時，我才推門進去。只見一間類似課堂的屋子裏，坐着，站着，男的，女的，都是人，可是大家都表現着有秩序和極興奮的樣子，使我忘記了南京路的不景氣和那些喪鐘似的喇叭銅鼓聲。我把目光在大家的臉上身上一掃過去，便看見在一架黑色鋼琴旁邊壁上掛着一面小旗似的　織，寫明是螞蟻歌咏團」，同時，也有「螞蟻劇團」的標幟。在這時候，我一面望，一面從人叢中行進到另一間屋子裏，那是一間圖書滿架的地方，在那進口處出來了一位社友，大約三十左右的年紀，很和靄的笑迎着我，原來就是沙千里先生。這時，恰巧來了一個新加入的社友，請求沙先生嚮導他參觀，於是我就跟着他們走到這裏那里。據沙先生吿訴那個新社友，原來剛才我所看。聽見的歌咏團，舉行時期每週只有二次，而且都是晚間七時起。其目的有三第一，提倡雄壯的歌曲；第二，硏究樂理；第三，藉集體的合唱激發民族的情緒。在歌咏會不舉行的時候，這間屋子便是螞蟻劇團排練的塲合。這時沙先生很誠懇很興奮地說：「我們大家都是利用公餘的閒空時間，想依着時代的要求，從事於和社會需要相適應的文化運動。而我們的精神則眞是在學那「螞蟻」，我們要用團體的力量，嚴峻的紀律，堅苦奮鬥地向着目標前進！我們覺得戲劇是人生的反影，也是社會文化運動普及大衆的一種最好工具。在目前國難嚴重時期，更會使大家感到需要，所以我們便以這劇團作爲本社重要工作之一。其目的，除了訓練演劇技術和探討戲劇理論而外，還想藉以完成文化運動的使命！』只見那個新社友問沙先生：『這劇團裏的團員全是社友嗎？』『全是的。凡加入這裏做社友的，每年僅納費三元，便可享有本社一切優益。』『那些優益呢？』那個社友不等他說完便接下去。沙先生接着說：『除了可以自由參加劇團和歌咏團以外，還可以享受圖書館贈送書目，不收保證金及借書費，借閱停寄的絕版及貴重書籍，和到館任意閱覽的特權；本社所設的補習學校，社友入學亦可得到特別優待；凡社友每月均得贈「螞蟻月刋一册，上載社友言論，文藝作品，社務討論與報吿，社友通訊，新書目錄等；又設有學術硏究會，暫分社會科學及文學兩組，社友不限資格，隨時可以請求登記入會爲會員；其餘如交誼會，參觀團，旅行團等，使社友與社及社友與社友間，常有聯絡感情，改良團體生活之機會。而參觀一項，從社會大規模的生產，文化機關，以至狹小的個人家庭和下層社會貧民窟等，均是對象，藉此使社友明瞭整個社會內層的弊害，以便相機改革。旅行團則係與第一特區工部局華員俱樂部及上海市國術館合組，名爲「三一旅行團」，常得以最經濟代價遊覽名勝古跡，各地參觀每次均人才濟濟，興趣盎然。『這次蟻社的徵求運動內容如何？』沙先生說：『蟻社成立到現在，已經六年了。每年有一屆徵求運動。今年便是第六屆徵求運動。我們的信念，以為文化應該是屬於大衆的，是大衆精神的食糧，用來改進大衆的生活。我們反對文化被少數人所覇佔，而用來作爲壓迫多數人的工具。所以大衆是我們文化運動的對象。我們之所以拿社友羣衆象徵螞蟻，也便是這個理由。因爲大衆是文化運動的對象，在從事文化運動的時候必須要深入到大衆中間，理解大衆的需要，作爲文化運動的指針，所以我們每次都是很廣泛的在社會內層去徵求同聲相應，同氣相求的朋友。』『蟻社的組織是怎麽樣？』『我們是以全體社友大會爲最高權力機關。由社友大會選舉十五人組執行委員會，五人爲候補執委，總管全社社務。執委會之下設總務，文化，社友　部，必要時再組織各種委員會。各部設正主任一人，副主任二人，由執行委員會互選分任之。我剛才所列舉的一些社友文化集團和組織，都是屬文化部設計，管理和推進的。此外我們每年都有一個一年計劃。』那個新社友又問：『今年的一年計劃怎樣？』沙先生未及回答便微笑着把那個新社友邀到另一間辦公室裏，在桌上和抽屜中取出好幾份印刷刊物。一面告訴那個新社友道：『這是本社年報第三卷第五六期合刊，也可以說就是月報；這是第五屆徵求特刋；這是第六屆徵求特刊；這是螞蟻劇團第　次公演特刊；這便是第五次一年計劃。』沙先生說着翻着書繼續向那新社友道：『從今年至明年的一年計劃，重要點『鞏固社的社會基礎，想多與其他社團聯　；擴大三一組織，以增加旅行效能；同時效法三一旅行團的辦法，參觀團亦徵求其他團體共同組織。至促進社友與社的聯繫關係方面，以後擬多召集社友舉行有興趣的集會；增設服務科顧問；擴大交誼會等。關於文化部工作：劇團方面：本年應有一次公演，並試演方言劇二次，參加農村演劇運動；採用集體寫作方法，產生有意義的劇本；發動小劇塲運動；實現免費公演。圖書館方面：本年增加圖書至四十冊；按月添購新書；增設兒童圖書部；組讀者座談會每三月召集一次。歌咏團本屆應舉行公開演奏唱歌會至少四次。關於新的事業，擬舉辦或發動木刻，漫畫，攝影等展覽運動及其他文化運動。在本年八月三十日第六屆社友大會中，並有兩個重要的决議，那便是（一）各地分社，應努力促其實現；（二）建立全國圖書館網。』在這時候，歌咏會裏又傳出了雄壯的集體歌聲，但似乎稍欠齊整。當那新社員問沙先生時，他說：『這是在練習「工人救國歌」，大家還沒有唱熟。』這時又有男女社友三四個人走到辦公室旁邊　部分空出來的地方立定後，彼此對說着舞台上劇辭，並由一位導演似的人在替他們同她們排列地位。照他們和她們那種專心研究旁若無火的神氣看來，足見蟻社的精神和紀律的嚴肅。同時，流利的國語也必然會使觀衆入耳動聽的。這時我聽能沙先生還在娓娓不倦的講着，可惜我的工作時間已到，不見再繼續聽不去　　別了他們走出蟻社。文藝作品回老家去（十）  大衛　　汽車滾下了秦家崗，到了工業區「八站」，一支支矗立着的烟囱好像枯癟了似地，一點氣息都沒有。中間像似有意把這凄凉景像揷進一些點綴，有幾支冒着稀薄的烟苗，但在門楣上或旗杆上都懸着太陽的符號。　　「西門臉　底廣塲上，像遊魂似的閒人，顯得更多了。披着牛皮大衣，把錢兜子夾在腿股間的公共汽車售票姑娘，搶了一個男査票員正在嘴里咬着的半個梨，一面往嘴裏塞，一面跳上大汽車底門，笑嘻嘻地向査票員招着手，喊着：道裏！」「阿不利司丹！」　　一個人力車夫伸長了　子，對着一個拿着鞭子的斗子車夫在吵架。　　那一邊不知道發生了什麽新鮮事情，人們一窩蜂似地擁了過去。　　在一個鴉片零賣所的門前，一個蓬髮綠衣的姑娘，只穿了一支袖子，衣裳披散着，骯髒的紅短褲下，立着兩條麻桿般細的腿，正牽着一個灰長衫的男子在情別。　　警察把指揮棒在手里甩過來甩過去，眼光直釘着那兩支瘦腿和一雙綉花的拖鞋。　　「吁！哈爾濱變了！」老趙呌着。　　「哈爾濱『文明』了！有了女售票員。」老相說着，抹了一下嘴巴，做着憨相　　「還可以在大街上講「戀愛」哪！嘿！」小蘇也開口了。　　「這就是王……」老趙拉了我一下，看了看汽車夫。　　我們這一羣是在打訕嗎？是在說笑話嗎？　　說不出來的聲音喲！　　汽車把我們送到了東北旅館。爲了經濟和方便，內中三個都搬到老趙底親戚家里去住。　　疲乏極了，甜睡眞是一件快樂的事情。　　晨間，一個破喉嚨女人的吵閙擾醒了我們。　　茶房告訴我們說，「是因爲一個嫖客過了夜，不給錢想要偸着溜，所以在爭吵。」　　老相和我搭上了往南崗的電車，想到工業大學去看一看從前的幾位老敎授。　　我倆到車站就下來，沿着我們十年前所常走的路慢慢地走下去，我倆都沉默着在想十年前的一切喲！　　在公園角的一個「拉夫卞，是我們讀書時代所常照顧的，我們又到這兒喝了兩杯「不雜」，那駝着背的俄國老頭子，還是穿着那件永遠不壞的黑燕尾服，像十年前一樣，很殷勤地招呼我們。等我們吿訴了他，我們是十年前的顧客時，他搖了搖頭，在皺縮的臉皮上擠出一絲微笑，握一握我們底手。　　問了問他底生活近况，他說：今非昔比了，小鼻子　底天下，我們沒法活呀！」　　我們又沉默了。穿出了公園，走着，想着。　　當我們走進了「公司街」口，看到了工大的樓房時，心里突地悸動了一下。我們想馬上撲過去。　　越往前走，我們心里底熱情越消减下去。　　院心底蓬蒿長得快要能埋沒人了。「工業大學」四個水泥字只剩下一個半字了，斑駁的痕跡還看得很淸楚，窗檻上都掛着破玻璃。　　我倆互相看了一眼，都沒有響。繞着這座荒凉廢樓，走了一圈。　　這是凭弔嗎？（未完）</p>

<h3>Suma Arrives in Tokyo, Arita Convenes Leadership Conference, Japan Rejects Ambassador Xu's Proposal, Opposes Partial Resolution of Pending Issues, Ministers of Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs to Meet Next Week</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Suma, the Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, arrived here today to report to the Japanese government on the results of recent negotiations between China's Foreign Minister Zhang and the Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe to resolve various issues between China and Japan. Suma refused to discuss the negotiation process in front of reporters, only stating that the negotiations between the two sides had reached an extremely delicate stage. Suma then immediately rushed by car to the official residence of Foreign Minister Arita to report on the current state of Sino-Japanese negotiations. According to Jiji News, the ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs will convene a meeting on Monday or Tuesday, which Suma will also attend. After that, he will probably set off for Shanghai. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Suma, the Consul-General in Nanjing, arrived in Tokyo at 3:25 PM on the 24th aboard the Fuji train. Kuwashima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, greeted him at the station. Foreign Minister Arita then convened an important conference at his official residence at 4:00 PM, gathering Consul-General Suma, Vice Minister Horinouchi, Director Kuwashima, Chief of the First Section Kamimura, and other key figures to hold important consultations. Suma first reported in detail on the current state of Sino-Japanese negotiations after the fifth meeting between Zhang Qun and Kawagoe on the 21st, as well as China's policy towards Japan and the movements of various powers in relation to China. After local officials made important suggestions on how to deal with future negotiations, they proceeded with major consultations and conducted a fundamental review of the new instructions to be handed to Ambassador Kawagoe. (Dohmei, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After listening to the local situation from Consul-General Suma, who returned to Tokyo on the 24th, and the suggestions from resident officials, Toyota, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, who consulted with Vice Minister Hasegawa, departed from Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM on the 25th to head west due to the naval review. He will meet with Navy leaders, including Navy Minister Nagano, at the Oriental Hotel in Kobe to convey the contents of Consul-General Suma's report and hold important consultations on future policies. (Dohmei, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Xu Shiying, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, which sparked much speculation. Although the details of the meeting were not announced, well-informed observers in diplomatic circles believe that the two-and-a-half-hour meeting focused on the negotiations in Nanjing. Ambassador Xu must have requested Japan to change its attitude towards China. It is widely believed that Xu suggested leaving the issues of North China autonomy and joint anti-communism on the agenda to be dealt with after the matters on which compromises have been reached in principle have been resolved. It is reported that Arita replied that the frequent occurrence of anti-Japanese violence in China is largely due to the unresolved issues of North China autonomy and other pending cases. Unless this deep-seated resentment is eliminated, a fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is unlikely. The Japanese government firmly opposes the partial resolution of pending issues, so he cannot accept Ambassador Xu's proposal. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As the prospects for Sino-Japanese negotiations do not allow for optimism, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, acting on instructions from the Chinese government, visited Foreign Minister Arita at his residence at 2:00 PM on the 23rd for a lengthy discussion that lasted two-and-a-half hours. Ambassador Xu explained the Chinese government's position on Sino-Japanese negotiations to Foreign Minister Arita and departed at 4:30 PM. (Dohmei, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the continued talks between Zhang and Kawagoe on the 21st on Sino-Japanese negotiations failed to reach an agreement, Suma was ordered to return to Japan to report. Although there have been contacts between China and Japan in recent days, the date for the sixth Zhang-Kawagoe meeting has not yet been set. It is generally expected that Kawagoe will set a date after Suma seeks instructions.

<h3>Diplomatic Stalemate: Attitude of Japanese Military Departments, Arrogance of Young Officers Greatly Diminished, Unlikely to Take Risky Last Resort</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) It is confirmed that both the Kwantung and North China Armies of the Japanese military have no better way to promote Sino-Japanese diplomacy. The Japanese side believes that if they insist on achieving their goals, there is no other good way except to adopt the last resort of extreme policies. However, the so-called high-ranking leaders of the army are unwilling to take risky actions. The faction of young officers in both military departments, due to our calm response, feels that it is difficult to advance and their arrogance has been greatly diminished. Even in the Suiyuan area, although plans have been finalized, they are afraid of failure and dare not act rashly. Those familiar with the Japanese situation say that if we insist on our position, the other side will definitely not take the risky last resort, and we can safely overcome this difficulty. The actions of the plainclothes teams in Shanghai are a justification for the Marine Corps and do not reflect a determination to fight. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan to Discuss Insurance Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Insurance Law, the Insurance Industry Law, and the Insurance Industry Implementation Law, which were reviewed, revised, and passed by the Commercial Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, may be submitted again to the Yuan's meeting next week for discussion. The revised Insurance Law includes three chapters: General Provisions, Property Insurance, and Personal Insurance, totaling one hundred articles, which is a significant supplement to the one promulgated in the eighteenth year of the Republic. The revised Insurance Industry Law only changes the "Property Insurance" within it to "Property Loss Insurance," in accordance with the Insurance Law, to ensure uniformity. The Insurance Industry Implementation Law consists of twenty articles, which stipulate that the Ministry of Actual Affairs may establish insurance supervisors in areas where the insurance industry is flourishing to supervise the insurance industry. In other areas, the Construction Department or the Social Affairs Bureau will be in charge. The security deposit that the insurance industry should pay according to law has also been stipulated and should be deposited into the national treasury within six months after the implementation of the Insurance Industry Law. Insurance contracts stipulate that Chinese characters should be used. In view of the extremely developed insurance business in China in recent years, the Commercial Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan has specially revised and formulated the above three cases to facilitate promulgation and implementation and to meet social needs.

<h3>Control Yuan to Investigate Civil Servants Using Drugs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan previously approved a public letter from the Chairman of the Military Commission and concurrently the Director-General of the Anti-Smoking Bureau regarding the case of reporting Party, government, and military service personnel smoking opium and using drugs. It had previously been submitted to the National Government to be forwarded to subordinate agencies for implementation. However, it has been heard that Party, government, and military service personnel inside and outside the capital still secretly use drugs. At a time when smoking and drugs are strictly prohibited, if Party, government, and military personnel cannot be purged, what explanation can be given to the general public? It is specially requested that the Control Yuan conduct a serious investigation. The Control Yuan approved the consultation and has ordered each supervising inspector to conduct extensive investigations, truthfully report, and strictly investigate and handle the matter.

<h3>Writing and Photos of the Horse Show in Suiyuan (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zong Liangdong</p>
<p>The competition began at noon. At the sound of the silver horn on the rostrum, tens of thousands of spectators craned their necks and applauded, eager to see who would win. The competition began with a preliminary round of pacing horses, with a distance of one li. Seventy horses participated, in groups of five, with a qualification standard of a non-disrupted pace within one minute and twenty seconds. The next was the preliminary round of running horses, with 140 horses participating in 18 groups, each group also consisting of five horses. The distance was three li, and the qualification standard was a speed within two minutes and fifty seconds. On the first day of the preliminary round, 77 running horses and 28 pacing horses qualified. On the second day, the running horses in the semi-final had to reach the finish line within two minutes and forty-five seconds, while the pacing horses had to do so within one minute and sixteen seconds. Changes in gait were limited to three times or less; more than that would result in disqualification.</p>
<p>The second day of the competition happened to be a Sunday, and the crowd was even more congested than on the first day. The double semi-final for pacing horses started in the morning, and the show of colts and mules began in the afternoon. First, the committee members and referees examined them. The standard for the show was: (1) pure Mongolian breed; (2) healthy and sound reproductive function; (3) teeth and coat color between four and seven years old, but the coat color must be one of three types: deer tail (date chestnut), chestnut (red hare), and dark (black); (4) body height from the withers to the ground must be more than four to five chi; (5) the head must be square, the forehead must be broad, the ears erect, and the eyes clear and spirited; (6) the body must be healthy, strong, and vigorous, with organ development, a shiny coat, and rich springiness; the temperament must be brave, lively, decisive, and intelligent. The show process was divided into three steps: first, looking at the physique; second, looking at the form; and finally, making an overall judgment.</p>
<p>The audience's attention was focused on the final day's final of pacing horses and running horses, so the stands and the outside of the track were crowded with spectators. Several famous jockeys had already become household names and were even more excited at this moment. Among them, the young children Li Ren and Yin Shixiang, who had won the championship in the previous year's competition and had been praised by Chairman Chiang, were the most prominent. It is said that when Chairman Chiang came to Suiyuan to watch the competition in the previous year, he saw that he was only a child of thirteen or fourteen years old, and he was able to win the championship in the running horse competition, so he awarded him 500 yuan and instructed Chairman Fu to cultivate him in school. The running horses in the final on the last day were all the horses that had won the semi-finals over the three days. They were truly "handsome horses, strong steeds." During the competition, the wind was blowing and the horses were galloping, and the crowd cheered. The atmosphere was tense, and it was truly exciting and emotional. In the end, Li Rong's Big Blue Horse from Baotou County took the lead with a time of two minutes, twenty-four and one-fifth seconds, winning the championship. Yin Shixiang, the young child who had attracted attention for days, was the runner-up because the horse's rein broke in the middle, and the horse's direction became unstable. After the final, Chairman Feng Xi and Chairman Fu of the conference committee gathered the first-place horses of each category to name them. The first-place colt was named "Dragon Colt," produced in Sazhou County; the first-place mule was named "Fankang," produced in Wuchuan County; the first-place pacing horse was named "Bian Cong," produced in the Central Public Banner of Mongolia; and the first-place running horse was named "Bei Ang," produced in Urad of Baotou. After the naming ceremony, an exhibition was held, with each first-place horse wearing a flower in its head, led by a military band to wait for the awards. The first-place winners each received a prize of 300 yuan and other prizes.</p>
<p>After the closing ceremony, the winning horses were led by a military band from the main road around the old city. At that time, the wide road was filled with flags and banners, the music was deafening, and the whole city was empty. Old and young came out to watch the excitement, which was crowded with people.</p>
<p>The results of this year's horse show were clearly better than those of the previous ones; especially the Mongolian horses participated more enthusiastically and were particularly excellent. However, the focus of the conference was on breed improvement, so special attention was paid to breed improvement methods after the conference.</p>
<p>In recent years, Suiyuan-produced horses can be sold to Guangdong and Guangxi, and even Gansu, which has always been known for its horse production, has come to buy them. This shows that sales are greater than before, and the central army sends people to Suiyuan to buy military horses every year, totaling several tens of thousands. This makes the people of Suiyuan who raise horses excited. It is said that the number of horses produced increased by about 10,000 last year. If the price of each horse is calculated at 50 yuan, then Suiyuan Province will invisibly increase its production by 500,000 yuan each year. This has a significant indirect impact on the welfare of the people in terms of finance. Therefore, this annual horse show can also be said to be an important task for the revitalization of the nation and economic construction. (Written in Saibei on October 13, 1936.)</p>

<h3>Chengdu Correspondence Chengdu and Chongqing (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Changqing</p>
<p>In Sichuan, Chengdu and Chongqing are two places that are quite famous, just like Nanjing and Shanghai in Jiangsu. However, if you were to ask some Sichuanese which province Chengdu and Chongqing belong to, they would be at a loss. It is not my intention to be deliberately sarcastic in describing them, but the prevalence of illiteracy in Sichuan—no, to put it more broadly, throughout China—is not surprising.</p>
<p>In terms of geographical situation, Chengdu relies on the mountains for its strength, with intricate water flows; Longquan (mountain name) and Minshan Mountains form a front and back barrier; the Min and Tuo Rivers surround the city, making it a naturally advantageous position, and it is an excellent place in the Sichuan Basin. Anyone who has been here knows that the land of the "West Sichuan Plain" is all black and oily, producing the largest amount of grain every year, which can not only supply the local people's food, but also export a large amount to the upper East Sichuan and North Sichuan regions. There are few floods and droughts, and famines like "eating the rich" are rare. Chongqing occupies the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, holding the throat of the entire province. Land and water transportation are accessible in all directions. It is a strategic location for military strategists, and the Tushan Zishui area has its own unique landscape!</p>
<p>Chengdu and Chongqing are more than a thousand kilometers apart. One is in West Sichuan, where the provincial capital is located, serving as the center of culture and politics. The other is in East Sichuan, the only important commercial port in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, where the province's economic power is concentrated and constantly rotating. Some have compared it this way: Chengdu is like present-day Beiping, while Chongqing is like Shanghai, only smaller. They are opposed to each other, but they also have a very close relationship.</p>
<p>"Go to Chengdu" or "Go to Chongqing." These are two common idioms for people from the interior of Sichuan when they go out. People who grew up in Sichuan have almost all heard these words to the point of nausea. These words clearly indicate the two important destinations for people who go out. Those who are used to "running around" focus their goals on these two places. Even some poor friends who have never gone out, if they are ever forced to develop outwards, their ideal places will inevitably be Chengdu and Chongqing.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people compare Chengdu and Chongqing to a pair of sisters; Chengdu is like a well-educated young lady from a wealthy family; Chongqing is like a vulgar and unbearable philistine woman. In the past, they were very incompatible. Since a string of cannons was fired from the other side of the Tuo River one year, they have reconciled. Now, from Chengdu to Chongqing, the waterway can go south through the Fujiang River, passing through Jiading, Jianwei, and Xufu before heading east. The land route relies only on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway. Although there are other roads that can pass, they are all winding and dangerous. Therefore, even now, there still seems to be a layer of separation between Chengdu and Chongqing. If the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is completed in the future, they will naturally become very close.</p>
<p>Because of historical and political relations, Chengdu is more culturally distinct. Emperor Liu Xian based himself here with a spirit of hard work; Zhang Xianzhong, who killed without batting an eye, once ruled as emperor in Chengdu; and some non-orthodox emperors and officials such as Meng Zhixiang and Wang Jian... all established their capitals here. Even now, the old site of the imperial city is still preserved. As for poets such as Du Fu and Xue Hongdu, the "globally renowned" female proofreader..., remnants and traces of their existence remain to this day, allowing people to mourn. Speaking of Chongqing, "Jiangba does not produce talented people," and no ancient emperor has ever favored it. It can be seen that the people lack cultural relics.</p>

<h3>National Funeral of Mr. Hu Zhantang</h3>
<p>— The Capital</p>
<p>Today is the day of the national funeral for Mr. Hu Zhantang, Chairman of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, in Guangdong. The entire country is flying flags at half-mast and all forms of entertainment and banquets are suspended. In this solemn atmosphere, there is a deep sense of sorrow. This is to express the final farewell and mournful thoughts for this person who created the era. As the emotions are uniform, the actions will naturally be consistent. The central government had already dispatched personnel to prepare for the national funeral ceremony. The grandeur of the ceremony needs no further explanation, and the enthusiasm for participating in the memorial service is also the ultimate expression of honor and sorrow. The central government has already sent five members, including Ju Zheng and Sun Ke, to travel there promptly. Local authorities, organizations, and groups, both inside and outside the capital, have either sent representatives or individuals, all not shying away from the long journey. The sight of officials and dignitaries arriving in droves is imaginable. When we recall Mr. Hu's past merits and his integrity and self-discipline, his unyielding spirit, and our admiration for his noble character, our hearts are filled with emotions. We would also like to take this opportunity to express our condolences and profound admiration.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhantang passed away in Guangdong on May 12th of this year due to a cerebral hemorrhage. It has been five months and thirteen days since then. After the devastating news spread, the entire country expressed its shock and grief. The 12th meeting of the Central Executive Committee immediately resolved to hold a national funeral. Later, it was decided to appoint eleven people, including Xiao Focheng, as members of the preparatory committee for the national funeral ceremony. Initially, it was planned to relocate the burial to Nanjing. However, after accepting the family's proposal, Longyandong's Shiling Mountain in Panyu County was chosen as the burial site. The remains were originally placed in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. It was not until July 13th that they were moved to the Shiling Cemetery. The National Government issued an order on September 5th, designating October 25th as the date for the national funeral. After several careful deliberations and months of construction and preparation, the funeral arrangements have been completed. From now on, the tomb will be settled, and the spirit will be eternally at rest. As far as Mr. Hu is concerned, there should be no regrets. However, those who sincerely cared for Mr. Hu are saddened by the fact that his physical form is forever beyond reach, and they fear that the connection to his spirit will become increasingly distant. The feelings of bewilderment and sorrow are difficult to resolve. Fortunately, Mr. Hu's sincere words and clear teachings still resonate in our ears, providing guidance for reflection. Mr. Hu's steadfast integrity is engraved in our minds, providing ample inspiration. How to urgently catch up and implement his ideas is how we can comfort Mr. Hu, and not merely through funeral rites.</p>
<p>We have also read Mr. Hu's last instructions. Firstly, he said, "Political measures must be in accordance with the requirements of the country and the people." Secondly, he said, "The people of the whole country should use the spirit of resistance to protect the nation's survival to save the Chinese nation." Thirdly, he said, "What I deeply fear today is the ambiguity of national consciousness and the decline of national sentiment." Mr. Hu, aware of the imminent national crisis, deeply knew that without the power of national unity, there would be no hope of regeneration. Therefore, he repeatedly stated this to awaken attention. Tracing the purpose of his words, all the complex details can be summarized in one sentence: to cultivate a national renaissance movement. Unfortunately, Mr. Hu passed away with unfulfilled ambitions. How can we, the survivors, not continue his legacy? When commemorating Mr. Hu today, the people of the whole country should deeply recognize this point, constantly remind themselves, take it as their responsibility after death, and strive to achieve it.</p>
<h3>Forty U.S. Navy Aircraft Conduct Exercises in the Central Pacific, Involving Over a Thousand Personnel, a Magnificent Spectacle Unprecedented in Air Force Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Honolulu: Admiral King's flagship, the USS Wright, departed from Pearl Harbor today. Its destination is unknown. This is a signal for large-scale independent air force maneuvers to be held in the central Pacific. Four squadrons of U.S. Navy patrol aircraft will also depart from Pearl Harbor on Monday to participate in the exercises. The exercises will last for at least two weeks. These aircraft will use aircraft carriers as their base during the offensive and defensive war games and will concentrate near a certain shoal. The four squadrons of naval patrol aircraft, VP-1, VP-4, VP-8, and VP-10, consist of a total of forty aircraft, each with an average of five crew members. They will take off at dawn on Monday, led by Admiral King. The number of personnel participating in this exercise, including the eight hundred on board the flagship USS Wright and the crew of the twenty-three small steamers that departed with the flagship, will be over a thousand. The scope of the exercises and the number of aircraft and personnel involved are truly a magnificent spectacle unprecedented in air force exercises in the central Pacific. However, Admiral King is keeping the details of the exercises strictly confidential, only stating that they are routine exercises. The general area of the exercises is west of Midway Island, north of Wake Island, and south of Palmyra Island, but will also fly to Baker Island, Howland Island, and Jarvis Island. All of these are small coral islands in the Pacific that have recently been annexed by the United States. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Export Department Representative to China Discusses Promoting Trade Again, Emphasizing the Need for Rapid Transportation, Expected to Arrive in China in Early December</h3>
<p>(London) The newly appointed representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department to China, Mr. Kirkpatrick, gave an interview to the Daily Mail today, saying that British merchants must find ways to compete with American goods transported to China by fast ships and must strive to eliminate any disadvantages faced by Britain within the possible range. One issue that needs to be specially studied is the need to strive for the rapid transportation of passengers and goods. Mr. Kirkpatrick made the above remarks in response to a telegram sent by Lord Rothermere, the owner of a famous British newspaper, from Hong Kong, published in the Daily Mail, strongly urging the British government to provide assistance to British trade and shipping in the Far East.</p>
<h3>U.S. Election Predictions: Roosevelt Likely to be Re-elected, Already Dominant in Thirty-Two States, Landon Only Confident in Sixteen States</h3>
<p>(New York) According to comprehensive reports from Reuters reporters stationed throughout the United States, President Roosevelt is likely to win this election. Currently, Roosevelt is already dominant in thirty-two states, securing three hundred and fourteen electoral votes out of the five hundred and thirty-one electoral votes. The Republican presidential candidate, Landon, has a slight advantage in sixteen states, securing the remaining two hundred and seventeen electoral votes. (Note: The number of votes in each state is proportional to the number of its members in Congress.) The New England states, New York, and Pennsylvania have traditionally been Republican strongholds and are Landon's strong backing in this election, while the southwestern states all support President Roosevelt. Businessmen and financiers mostly support Landon, but organized labor and the unemployed all lean towards Roosevelt. The current debate is focused on President Roosevelt's personality and the achievements of the New Deal. Landon's attacks have mostly been ineffective. As for the power of the minor parties, it seems insignificant. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>The leader of the Cooperative Party, Ji, although has the power to split the votes in Minnesota, is also extremely limited. Currently, the general election has reached its peak. Roosevelt is currently traveling in the East, while Landon is giving speeches in the West. It is reported that on the day before the election, the cost of radio broadcasts alone will reach 100,000 U.S. dollars. Landon's throat ailment has healed. He continued his speech in Oklahoma yesterday. Although his voice was slightly hoarse, speaking did not feel difficult. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(New York) The Literary Digest magazine released its near-final results of its public opinion survey for this year's presidential election today. Twelve states remain undecided between the Democratic and Republican parties: New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska, Missouri, and West Virginia, accounting for 257 out of the nation's 531 electoral votes. Campaign leaders are all proclaiming victory, but all parties agree that the election is currently in a white-hot stage. Republican presidential candidate Landon has so far received 1,182,307 votes, corresponding to 370 electoral votes, with a lead in 32 states. President Roosevelt has received 878,526 votes, corresponding to 161 electoral votes, with a lead in the eleven southern states and Maryland, Kentucky, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Utah. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House announced today that President Roosevelt will depart from Washington at midnight on Tuesday to campaign in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware. On Wednesday morning, he will give a campaign speech in Bayonne and will take a boat to New York to attend the 50th anniversary celebration of the Statue of Liberty. On Thursday, the President will speak in Wilkes-Barre and then go to Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Camden, and Wilmington. This announcement has dispelled doubts that the President would be touring western states before the election. The President has returned from the industrial New England states today, confident that he can win the election. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the National Association of Manufacturers held dinners in eighteen locations. President Roosevelt delivered a radio address specifically for them. He dismissed the claim that the New Deal attempts to destroy private enterprise and establish socialism, saying that if the current government wanted to change the economic system, it could allow the old system to rot and harm the public. But we do not want to stand idly by and have decided to take active action to preserve private enterprise. The President also stated that business has improved considerably in recent days, but we should not cling to the theories of the prosperous era. The President concluded by declaring that he is determined to separate politics from business but also demands that business separate from politics, adding that the wage-earning class and the majority of businessmen are resentful of the few employers who spread rumors and deceive with alarmist statements.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt delivered a speech here recently, advocating for the protection of private enterprise and accusing the financial world of harboring ambitions to regain control of industrial production and wealth distribution. He also said that the economic policies he is pursuing are between laissez-faire policies and various enterprise control policies. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Oklahoma: Republican presidential candidate Landon called on true Democrats and Republicans to join forces to oppose the New Deal, saying that the current government is not a democratic government. Landon praised the defection of important figures such as Al Smith, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1932. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Oklahoma: Republican presidential candidate Landon delivered a speech here today, criticizing President Roosevelt for destroying the political principles of the Democratic Party and calling on all true Democrats to unite with the Republican Party to "save the American political system." This is the first time that a Republican presidential candidate has openly sought the support of Democrats to jointly oppose Roosevelt's New Deal. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Has Not Paid Up the Full Amount of South Manchuria Railway Shares, Matsuoka Asks Terauchi for Assistance, Tatekawa Reports His Impressions After the Inspection</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway, visited Army Minister Terauchi on the 24th, and Army Vice Minister Umezu was also present. They had detailed discussions for an hour and a half regarding the current state of the South Manchuria Railway's operations, the fourth railway construction plan, the issue of releasing all the shares of related business companies, and other matters, seeking the Army Minister's understanding. From the overall perspective of implementing the national policy towards Manchuria, he hoped for assistance. In particular, regarding the issue of the government's payment of share capital for its shares, President Matsuoka believed that this was not just a problem for the South Manchuria Railway but was also greatly related to the trends in the financial world, hoping that the government would actively proceed with it. The South Manchuria Railway is carrying out the plan of railway construction with great sacrifice and will continue to make the same efforts in the future. However, it seems that the authorities of the Ministry of Finance still do not understand the intentions of the South Manchuria Railway. He hoped that the Army Minister, in his capacity as Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, would give it deep consideration. The Army Minister agreed with President Matsuoka's views and promised to provide assistance. (Domei, 24th)</p>
<p>Kobe: Lieutenant General Tatekawa arrived at Kobe port on the 24th morning aboard the Rehe Maru. According to him, although the situation on the Manchurian-Soviet border is tense, it is not considered to be on the verge of a sudden outbreak. He believes that the Soviet Union clearly harbors fear of the Japanese army, so it is striving to strengthen its military preparations. Manchurian immigrants have reached the realm of economic self-sufficiency and have achieved considerable success. However, the plan for one million households and 1.8 billion yuan over twenty years is still insufficient. Industrial development, especially heavy industry, has great potential in the future. Manchuria benefits from the 11 yuan tariff per ton on Japanese iron ore. To fully develop Manchuria, the current economic policy towards Manchuria is not sufficient. (Domei News Agency, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan Trains Flight Personnel, 500-600 Every Year</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to strengthen civil aviation, the Ministry of Communications has decided to train 100 aircraft operators every year, and the necessary expenses have been included in the next fiscal year's budget. Recently, it has further established a plan to train 500 student aviators every year. It will expand the organization of the Student Aviation League and build necessary facilities in cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, and Fukuoka to conduct aviation training for 500 to 600 students.

<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Aircraft Wreak Havoc, Aviator Freely Discusses Bombing Techniques, Apprehension Rises in the Capital</h3>
<p>Madrid: Several rebel army aircraft dropped four bombs in the vicinity of Guadalajara today, causing great panic among the people in the capital. Yesterday, the Aranjuez radio station malfunctioned, disrupting telephone communication between here and London, but it has been restored today. It is said that the radio station may have been bombed by the rebel army. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Talavera: Although the troops of General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish National Revolutionary Army, have temporarily halted their advance to consolidate their positions, their air force continues to attack day and night, greatly affecting the morale of the Madrid garrison and the trench defense fortifications of various key positions. The air force of the National Revolutionary Army possesses the latest type of aircraft, as can be proved by the conversation between a special correspondent of this newspaper and a member of the air force under General Franco today. According to the conversation, "We piloted the aircraft through the Guadarrama Mountains in the dark, then immediately shut off the engine so that there was no sound during the descent. In addition to machine guns, the aircraft was also equipped with magnesium bombs attached to parachutes, which emitted a bright light when dropped, making all the targets on the ground clearly visible. The aircraft I was piloting dropped four bombs with great explosive power, each weighing 250 kilograms. After that, the aircraft quickly ascended, making it impossible for anti-aircraft guns to use their skills." (Havas, 24th)</p>

The bow of the Libertad was also hit by a shell and, protected by two torpedo boats, sailed north. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Repeated European Crises, a Powder Keg About to Explode, Britain Purchases a Thousand Aircraft from the U.S., Causing Widespread Fear of War, Japan Pays Attention to the Development of the Situation</h3>
<p>(New York) It is rumored that Britain is currently ordering 1,000 military aircraft from the United States and Canada, causing the stocks of aircraft manufacturing companies to soar today. It is reported that the Boeing Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Canada will manufacture 300 bombers, and U.S. factories will manufacture 700 light bombers. The British people almost unanimously support the government's rearmament plan. Now, this development has increased people's fear of future wars. Some people now say that the capture of Madrid by the Spanish National Army will trigger a European war. Once the National Army enters the capital, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Greece will recognize it as the legitimate government of Spain, and the United States will follow the lead of Britain and France. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the news that the Soviet Union has withdrawn from the Spanish non-intervention agreement and that the Portuguese government has severed diplomatic relations with Spain, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received official telegrams. As it has subtle implications for international relations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is temporarily refraining from making any comments. In short, the movements of various countries tend to induce an intensification of the confrontation between the left and right wings in Europe. Therefore, special attention is paid to its progress. The statements of the Portuguese and Indian governments severing diplomatic relations with the Spanish government are also actions to counter the Soviet Union's support for the government army and to publicly clarify their stance of supporting the anti-government army. Therefore, the Soviet Union's resistance to Germany, Italy, and Portugal has intensified to the point of exercising its power at this time. The political situation in Europe has reached an unstable situation that is about to explode. However, Britain, in the midst of this, maintains a completely neutral stance. France, in view of the separation of the Little Entente countries, the rise of Germany, and the major changes in the international situation, has recently been changing to an ambiguous attitude of avoiding joint actions with the Soviet Union. Therefore, whether Britain and France can take effective measures to dissolve the imminent European war clouds is the most important factor in determining the future political trends, and thus it is particularly noteworthy.

<p>Manchester: Lloyd George, Prime Minister during World War I, declared to the Revival Movement Committee here today, "The current international situation has deteriorated, which has not happened since the Great War.

<h3>Soviet Russia Prepares for Free Action in Spain</h3>
<p>(London) The Soviet government has now decided to resume its freedom of action regarding the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war. However, for the time being, the Soviet representative will not withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee. Today, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, wrote to the Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Plymouth, saying, "The non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war has been repeatedly violated by several signatory countries. Portugal has virtually become a base for supplying the Spanish rebel army, while the legitimate government of Spain has been deprived of the convenience of purchasing military supplies from abroad to protect its people. This fact of violating the non-intervention agreement has created a superior position for the Spanish rebel army, resulting in the prolongation of the civil war in Spain and the increase in the number of victims. It seems that this non-intervention agreement is empty, becoming a piece of waste paper, and does not actually exist. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that the restrictions imposed on the Soviet Union regarding non-intervention in the Spanish civil war should not be greater than the restrictions imposed on any country that signed the non-intervention agreement." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) After the meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee, the Russian ambassador told a Reuters reporter that the Soviet Union had not formally withdrawn from the committee. Another Soviet representative said that the Soviet Union would still attend the subcommittee meeting held this morning. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The subcommittee composed of thirteen representatives from major countries of the Non-Intervention Committee held a meeting at the British Foreign Office at 10:30 this morning to review the general work of the entire committee and asked the Soviet Union to clarify certain points in the letter from its Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, to the committee. Maisky arrived first. When a Reuters reporter asked if he thought the Soviet Union was bound by the letter, Maisky replied, "Yes, I think the letter takes effect when it is presented to the committee." The subcommittee met for two hours and forty-five minutes, considering whether the non-intervention agreement could be made more effective and, if so, by what means. It is said that no decisions were made, and discussions will continue early next week. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations officials predicted that if the Soviet government abandons the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war, the League of Nations Council may convene a temporary meeting in the shortest possible time at the request of the Soviet government or the Madrid government. It is also said that the Soviet government's decision will definitely have serious implications, and the permanent delegations of the League of Nations member states are now closely monitoring the development of the situation. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The committee issued a communiqué stating that at the beginning of today's meeting, Lord Plymouth explained in detail that the British government agreed to set up a committee in London to prevent the Spanish civil war from spreading beyond its borders and to establish a cooperative plan for all countries to avoid the war from turning into an international crisis. He also urged all committee members to examine various intelligence with a spirit of fairness in order to fulfill their arduous work. Then, the letter from the Soviet Ambassador was officially read. After reading, the Portuguese representative stood up and firmly denied the Soviet Union's accusations of Portugal violating the agreement, dismissing them as unfounded. He said that it would be clear when Portugal's reply was received. The committee then decided to transfer the Soviet letter to the subcommittee and invited the Soviet representative to attend the meeting to clarify certain points in the letter. During the discussion, Lord Plymouth expressed his opinion, saying that the German government's reply to the Spanish government's accusations was very satisfactory, but there were only two points that needed to be further clarified by the German government. The committee then followed his suggestion and decided that the Soviet Union's proposal to have the British or French navy or the navies of both countries control Portuguese seaports could not be considered until Portugal's reply was received. The Portuguese representative declared that he could not agree to discuss the issue. The committee also decided that the subcommittee should meet tomorrow morning to review the general work of the committee and consider how to make the non-intervention agreement more effective. The Soviet Ambassador declared that he was willing to immediately reply to the rebuttals in the Italian and German replies, but the committee did not allow him to speak, saying that if he wanted to rebut, he should first submit a written text. Finally, the committee decided that the next meeting would be held on October 28. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Portugal Announces Severance of Relations with Spain</h3>
<p>Capital of Portugal: The Portuguese government has severed diplomatic relations with the Spanish government. Foreign Minister Mondero has presented a note to the Spanish Ambassador, Arboñez, explaining the reasons for this action. The full text will be released at an appropriate time. The Portuguese Chargé d'Affaires in Spain, Viscount Tamega, moved from Madrid to the port of Arigander in eastern Spain in August and has been ordered to board a Portuguese warship in that port and return home immediately. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Following the Portuguese government's severance of diplomatic relations with the Spanish government, political figures deeply fear that this will cause a serious reaction. It is believed that after Portugal's break with Madrid, Portugal, Italy, and Germany may recognize the National Army government in Burgos, Spain, in the short term. Thus, these three countries will regard the National Army government as the legitimate government of Spain, and subsequent supplies of arms to General Franco, the leader of the National Army government, may be considered legitimate. If so, some countries will recognize one government in Spain, while others will recognize another, creating a clear division and strict boundaries, and the international situation will become increasingly entangled and beyond repair. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>The True Intentions of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The note delivered by Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, to the Non-Intervention Committee yesterday was worded ambiguously, causing considerable confusion among political figures here. However, it is generally expected that the Soviet Union is awaiting the reaction of various countries to this note. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union is willing to supply arms to the Spanish government, but it is also striving to avoid competition with Germany and Italy in transporting arms. Therefore, while the Soviet Union claims the right to act freely in Spain, it is unwilling to genuinely abandon the neutrality agreement, lest it be criticized by the world. The Soviet people are now prepared for any eventuality, but it is unlikely that there will be severe actions in the next few days. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Supervisory Committee for the Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to continue its meeting this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Eden and the French Ambassador to the UK, Corbin, consulted this morning on how the non-intervention agreement can be effectively respected. It is reported that a plan has been decided upon, namely, that warships from each signatory country should be dispatched to monitor all Spanish ports, whether controlled by the government forces or the National Army. Although the Soviet Union has declared its willingness to withdraw from the committee, it still has a hidden desire to continue participating. This action by the UK and France is intended to satisfy this desire. Responsible parties have announced that this plan will be submitted for discussion at the meeting of the Supervisory Committee this afternoon, at which time the Soviet representative will also exert their strategy to the fullest extent. What is the strategy? It is to declare that the work of the Supervisory Committee has failed, so that world public opinion will sympathize with the Spanish government, thereby satisfying them. On the other hand, with the prospect of convening the Locarno Conference, the Soviet Union will certainly not want to withdraw from the international committee and thus become isolated. It is said that the reason why the Soviet Union has leveled accusations against certain countries for undermining the non-intervention agreement is driven by a desire to emulate the actions of those countries. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) After the adjournment of the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War at 1:30 PM today, the Soviet representative, Chargé d'Affaires to the UK, Kagan, immediately declared that the Soviet delegation would continue to cooperate in the meetings of the Adjustment Committee for the time being. According to well-informed officials, the Soviet representative stated this morning in the subcommittee that he would inquire with Moscow about the meaning of the Soviet government's decision yesterday to resume free action on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. At the same time, the British delegation is planning to propose that the countries concerned jointly dispatch warships to monitor Spanish ports, so as to satisfy the Soviet Union and provide a way to resolve the situation.

<h3>Spain Proves Again: Germany and Portugal Aid the Rebels - Three Italian Aircraft Arrive in Spain</h3>
<p>(London) The Spanish government has sent two official documents to the British Foreign Office, listing various facts of violating the non-intervention agreement. The first document includes a photographic copy of a telegram from the Deputy Governor-General of Spanish Guinea, stating that the Portuguese ship "Macao," with its hull and smokestack painted in the German style, appeared outside the port at 8:00 AM on October 14. At close range, it shelled and sank the Spanish ship "Fernando Po," drowning the captain and 40 sailors. The Portuguese ship then shelled the Deputy Governor-General's residence, fortunately without hitting it. The second document states that on October 8, 160 German youths arrived in Seville on a German ship, carrying 12 anti-aircraft guns to join the rebels. On October 19, 16 German submarines sailed through the strait. On October 20, the German armored ship "Deutschland" sailed out of Malaga and Valencia, collecting orders and mail along the way to deliver to a German seaplane serving the rebels. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to sources in Genoa, three Italian "BR4" heavy bombers were transported from Turin, Italy, to Spain on October 20 for the use of General Franco. This is new evidence of Italian aid to the rebels. (TASS Dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Berlin) A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declared today that Germany's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia was not conditional on any concessions from the Italian side. It should be known that this situation is a natural result, as Germany has always maintained a neutral policy and strives to avoid being drawn into any conflict that has nothing to do with Germany.

<h3>Germany Prepares: Goering Orders Control of Industry</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Minister of Aviation and Prussian Prime Minister General Goering was recently appointed as the dictator of the four-year economic plan. To ensure that German industry is fully prepared, he ordered today the implementation of control over the entire national industry, making it "more complete than in wartime."

<h3>French Radical Party: Cooperation with the Communist Party - Heated Debate Begins at Congress</h3>
<p>Biarritz: A resolution of great importance to the life of the Socialist Party government led by incumbent Prime Minister Blum is being hotly debated at the Radical Party Socialist Congress here. The focus of the issue is whether to continue cooperation with the Communist Party. The current situation has become quite dark due to the attitude taken by the Soviet Union yesterday towards non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Blum's future is difficult to be optimistic about. At yesterday's congress, Radical Party Socialist leader Herriot made a shocking request, advocating continued cooperation with the Communist Party, but after the news that the Soviet Union had effectively withdrawn from the non-intervention agreement, Herriot's request has been implicitly dismissed. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Biarritz: The Radical Socialist Congress is scheduled to continue its meeting this afternoon to begin discussing general political issues. At that time, the two factions supporting and opposing the People's Front will engage in fierce verbal battles to determine the final outcome. Four proposals will be submitted at today's meeting: (1) The proposal submitted by Roche, leader of the Radical Socialist branch in the Northern Province; (2) The proposal submitted by Radical Socialist member Tauminique. The above two proposals both support continued participation in the People's Front, but with the condition that the Communist Party must provide a definite guarantee not to restrain the government's actions. (3) The proposal of Radical Socialist Congressman Kaiser. This proposal has been approved by 40 branches of the Radical Socialist Party, advocating that the party continue to participate in the People's Front and remain loyal to the current government, but demanding that law and order be maintained and that the occupation of factories by workers be stopped. The Radical Socialist member Beyer's proposal expresses trust in the People's Front and opposes all cabinet organizations that violate the wishes of the voters in the last general election. The proponents of the above proposals, as well as former Interior Minister Marchandeau-Gruneau, former Commerce Minister Pommier, etc., will all deliver speeches this afternoon. Defense Minister Daladier will also speak, so that a common resolution can be passed unanimously, using Kaiser's proposal as its blueprint. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Biarritz: The drafting committee of the Radical Socialist Congress convened this afternoon at 3:00 PM and began drafting a resolution for the congress. The task was completed at 8:00 PM. This resolution will be submitted to the congress in the name of the majority faction of the Radical Socialist Party. Its content approves the party's cooperation with the current government and advocates demanding that the current government respect the party's major principles within its platform. Another minority of Radical Socialists, led by Roche, leader of the Northern Province branch, intends to submit another motion targeting the actions of the Communist Party, which is worded more strongly. The above two drafts will be publicly submitted for discussion tomorrow, at which time the situation will be extremely heated. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Belgian Right-Wing to Hold Major Demonstration Today</h3>
<p>The Hague: The fascist Rexist Party, disregarding the government's ban, has decided to hold a demonstration tomorrow. To prevent any unforeseen circumstances, the government has taken precautionary measures. It is believed that no serious conflicts will occur. According to the party's agreed plan, all members were originally intended to gather in a private residence in the suburbs. It is now heard that this plan has been abandoned, and they plan to take the opportunity to join the ranks of the veterans of the Battle of the Yser in World War I when they parade in front of King Leopold III at 10:00 AM tomorrow. This plan has also been detected by the government, so it has ordered the veterans to shorten the ranks to avoid being exploited, even if the veterans are disappointed and unhappy. Therefore, the party leader has now changed the plan again, intending to immediately notify party members to gather at noon tomorrow, but the location of the gathering has not been announced. The entire city's military police have now been ordered to board and inspect all cars arriving in the capital from the provinces, especially those carrying many passengers. However, how many party members from the provinces who have obeyed the party headquarters' orders and come to the capital is still unknown to the party leaders at this moment. The party leader Degrelle told our reporter, "Our party intends to show the whole country its wishes. What are the wishes? That energetic, morally integrated, and patriotic people should hold official positions, while other mad dogs with revolutionary ideas should be sent to Moscow. As far as my announcement is concerned, all acts of violence are prohibited." Degrelle also said that in addition to holding a demonstration tomorrow, the party will also hold nine mass demonstrations across the country on November 1, including major cities such as Brussels, Antwerp, Liège, and Ghent.

<h3>International Labour Maritime Conference Passes Draft Conventions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labour Office Maritime Conference passed five draft conventions this morning: (1) The draft convention on certificates of competency for shipmasters was passed by a majority of 80 votes to 9. (2) The draft convention providing for 12 days of annual leave for ship officers and 9 days of annual leave for seafarers was passed by a majority of 60 votes to 15. (3) Two draft conventions on seafarers' sickness insurance, one passed by a majority of 70 votes to 14 and the other by a majority of 60 votes to 6. (4) The draft convention on employing seafarers on ships of 2,000 tons or more for 56 hours per week was passed by a majority of 62 votes to 17. Representatives of the British and Japanese governments both voted against it. (5) Two recommendations, one advocating that the minimum age for working as a seafarer be increased from 14 to 15 years old, and the other advocating improving the living conditions of seafarers in various ports. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labour Office Maritime Conference continued its meeting today to discuss the draft convention on seafarers' working hours. The Chinese government representative, Bao Huaguo, made a declaration stating that the Chinese government, in principle, supports the eight-hour day system for seafarers. However, the convention on seafarers' working hours only applies to ocean-going vessels, and the Chinese shipping industry currently lacks such vessels. Therefore, the Chinese government cannot ratify this draft convention in the near future. However, to express the Chinese government's support for the principle of eight-hour work, it will vote in favor of this draft convention. Thereupon, the Maritime Conference passed the draft convention on seafarers' working hours on first reading. The draft convention stipulates that, in principle, employees on ships of 2,000 tons or more should work 56 hours per week. When the draft convention was put to a vote, the British government representative, Jenkins, stated that he was instructed by his government to vote against the draft convention and said that the British government did not intend to ratify this convention. Subsequently, the Chinese labor representative, Zhao Banfu, submitted two resolutions: (1) requesting the Governing Body of the International Labour Office to discuss the issue of equal treatment for domestic and foreign seafarers; (2) demanding the abolition of the foreman contracting system. The so-called foreman contracting system is where the foreman contracts to hire workers, thus depriving seafarers of their freedom to choose ships, and hired seafarers are often subjected to inhumane treatment, so it should be abandoned urgently. These two resolutions were passed by the Maritime Conference and submitted to the Governing Body of the International Labour Office for handling. The Maritime Conference then passed a proposal by Japanese seafarer representative Horiuchi, advocating that the issue of compensation for seafarers injured on duty be discussed at the next Maritime Conference. Finally, the Maritime Conference passed a joint proposal by Japanese seafarer representative Horiuchi and employer representative Kawakawa, stating that the Maritime Conference supports finding ways to convene a world economic conference to promote economic recovery, so that the transportation industries of various countries in the world can be restored to prosperity.

<h3>North China Japanese Army Holds Large-Scale Exercise, Simulating the Occupation of Beiping; Several Thousand Civilian Houses Preemptively Requisitioned for Use; Beiping Taken as the Target for Seizure During the Exercise; Celebration Held in Assumption of Victory After the Exercise</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The large-scale exercise of the Japanese Army in North China is nearing its end. Infantry Brigade Commander stationed in Beiping, Kawahara Masami, specially came to Tianjin with his adjutant, Onoguchi, on the 22nd to attend the preparatory meeting for the large-scale exercise convened by Japanese Army Commander Tashiro. The meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the 22nd at the Japanese barracks in Hai Guang Temple. Independent Artillery Regiment Commander Suzuki stationed in Qinhuangdao, Captain Nakajima of Shanhaiguan, Pinbe of Tangshan, and Kagawa of Tanggu all rushed to attend. It was decided that the troops stationed in Tangyu, Australia, and Chang would mobilize from the 24th, first gathering in the Tianjin suburbs of Hai Xia, Xian Shui Gu, Xiao Liu Zhuang, and Da Zhi Gu. At 6:00 AM on the 26th, the Mutaguchi 1st Infantry Regiment near Beiping and the Katada Battalion in Fengtai will simultaneously conduct separate regimental exercises. That evening, after the meeting, each commander returned to their defense area to make preparations. Kawahara then took the night train to Tanggu and other places for inspection and to give instructions. From the 22nd, the Japanese Army Headquarters dispatched staff officers Keii, Ada, and Kabei to the suburbs of Pingfengtonglu to requisition civilian houses, directly contacting local township chiefs and police chiefs. Several thousand civilian houses were requisitioned in areas such as Tongzhou, Fengtai, outside Xizhimen in western Beiping, and Babaoshan. More than 400 civilian houses were also requisitioned in the Tianjin suburbs of Xian Shui Gu, Xiao Liu Zhuang, and Da Zhi Gu. Each civilian house was required to have a kang (heated brick bed) and be located on a street with important traffic. Each house was required to accommodate five soldiers, each with a daily rental fee of one jiao. From the 22nd, all homeowners were required to vacate, but two men were required to remain in each house to provide temporary services and were responsible for guarding any items left behind by the Japanese soldiers during the exercise. Although the residents were extremely unwilling, opposition was ineffective. For days, in the Tianjin suburbs of Da Zhi Gu, men, women, and children carried their belongings and came to Tianjin in an endless stream, in a very miserable state. The ignorant people spread rumors, causing widespread panic, believing that something terrible was about to happen. The Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters previously sent Chen Zhongfu to Tianjin to consult with Japanese Army Chief of Staff Hashimoto on this matter, requesting that they consider social order and tranquility. If there was a need to use houses for barracks, the government would find public property or factories and shops, which would save costs and make access easier. Hashimoto said that the matter had already been determined by the operations section of the military headquarters and could not be changed, but he would pay attention to restraining the troops as much as possible and occupying fewer civilian houses. As for the operational plan for this large-scale exercise, the Japanese military headquarters officially notified our Chahar-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters to inform all agencies. From the 26th to the 28th, separate regimental exercises will be held, combining various special forces, with the Mutaguchi and Kayashima 1st and 2nd Infantry Regiments as units, conducting operations in the suburbs of Pingjin, using new-style chemical warfare equipment, tanks, and armored car teams. Each regiment will have approximately 2,500 participants. The 29th will be a rest day. From the 30th to the 31st, regimental confrontation exercises will be held in Fengtai, Lugouqiao, Changxindian, and Tongzhou near Beiping. The 1st and 2nd Regiments will engage in encounters, defenses, and battles along the Pingjin and Pinghan roads. All troops under the Kawahara Brigade will participate, with Kawahara personally supervising, commanding, and issuing orders. November 1st will be a rest day. On November 2nd, Nam Dai will go to Tongzhou with all the staff of the military headquarters to set up the headquarters. From 5:00 AM that morning, a dawn battle will be held. More than 70% of the Japanese army in North China will participate, with Beiping and Fengtai as the targets for seizure. The Mutaguchi Regiment, combined with various chemical warfare units, will be the defending force, while the Kayashima and Suzuki Regiments and the Air Force will be the attacking force, demonstrating the latest-style equipment and combat power of the entire army. On November 3rd, a night battle and reconnaissance battle will be held. The hypothetical strategy is that Beiping, under superior defense, encounters pressure from the air and land forces and destruction of transportation, falling into isolation. Communication between Pinghan, Pingsui, and Pingjin is completely cut off. On the morning of November 4th, due to the successful special activities of the volunteer soldiers in civilian clothes outside Xizhimen, Beiping feels threatened and collapses. This section of the exercise is the main item arranged by the operations section of this session. Therefore, immediately after the exercise on that day, a celebration of the assumed victory will be held at Babaoshan in the suburbs of Beiping. A military parade will be held under the grand review of the Japanese representative. Rest in the afternoon and camp in western Beiping. The exercise will end on November 5th, and the troops will return to their defenses one after another. The intention of this exercise is a routine seasonal matter, but the scale of the mobilization and the certainty of the purpose cannot help but make one tremble for North China. (22nd) Beiping Dispatch: The Japanese garrison army in North China is scheduled to hold its autumn large-scale exercise from the 26th of this month to the 4th of November. First, there will be separate regimental exercises, then confrontational exercises, expanding into brigade exercises, and finally divisional exercises. Because the exercise time is long and the number of people is large, the lodging locations must be determined in advance. On the 21st, the Japanese side sent Infantry Major Okamura Katsumi, Accounting Officer Matsuo Kanji, Medical Officer Yakumoto Seishi, and Captain Adjutant Kono Matasaburo, together with Zhao Yafan, a member of the Second Section of the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau, to inspect lodging locations in the suburbs of Beiping and negotiate with local chambers of commerce to purchase firewood, white soybeans, pork, cabbage, and other necessary items, and to hire laborers to provide catering. On the first day (26th), the advance personnel of the Japanese army will arrive at Dongba to make arrangements. On the 27th, more than 2,300 Japanese officers and soldiers stationed in Fengtai and Tongxian will arrive in batches. On the 28th, they will depart to conduct exercises in Gongzhufen, Songjiafen, Sanshengci, and other places in eastern Beiping, and camp separately. On the 29th and 30th, they will continue to conduct exercises in Balizhuang, Dalincun, Tianlingsi in the southern suburbs, and Bailingguan, Yuanguangsi, Caishenmiao, and Wanshoushan in the western suburbs. On the last day, a military parade will be held in Babaoshan in Wanping County, with Japanese Commander Tashiro participating. At 10:00 AM that morning, all 200-plus officers will have a luncheon at the Natural History Museum and invite representatives from our military and political circles to participate. In total, there will be four days of exercises within the boundary of Beiping City: the 26th and 27th of this month and the 3rd and 4th of next month. In addition to the exercise of guns, Beiping's ancient city will be the assumed target of attack. This exercise, in addition to what they call ordinary military education, implies an on-the-ground survey of the terrain. In order to prevent citizens from being alarmed by the sounds at the time, the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau will issue a notice to inform the public and order each district team to stop resting during these ten days to provide protection. Furthermore, last month, for the sake of the exercise, the Japanese side requested to borrow our civilian houses at that time. The authorities stated that our country has no such custom. Although it is common for the Japanese, it is unprecedented in our country. In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Japanese side was asked not to adopt this approach. As a result, it is heard that our government will rent accommodations on their behalf. Battalion Commander Tanimura of the Japanese artillery regiment went to Fengtai from Beiping on the 22nd to negotiate with the local authorities. In addition to renting houses to be used as campsites for the Japanese army going to Beiping for exercises, they also rented a civilian house in Xinglong Hutong for the Japanese army in Tianjin to use.

<h3>New Facilities of the Gansu Provincial Government: Training Accounting Personnel, Relieving Refugees After Robbery, Constructing the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, and Preparing to Plant Trees Along the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Dispatch: Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong believes that the accounting personnel in various county bureaus are extremely important to the consolidation of local finances. In order to select and assist economic talents to consolidate local finances, he intends to prepare for the establishment of an accounting personnel training institute to engage in training in order to assign them to work in various counties. All students will be recruited through examinations and limited to high school graduates. After graduating from training, they will first practice in Gaolan County and then be assigned. He ordered the person in charge to properly draft regulations for implementation. The Provincial Affairs Conference has passed it, and preparations have already begun.</p>
<p>Minlin and other counties in this province have been ravaged by bandits for a long time. Resources have been plundered, livelihoods have been cut off, and people are gathering and crying, pitifully hungry and cold. Provincial Chairman Yu decided to implement emergency relief to provide assistance. He submitted a resolution to the Provincial Affairs Conference, ordering the Relief Committee to allocate 7,000 yuan to Minxian, 1,500 yuan to Lintao, 2,000 yuan to Lintan, 3,000 yuan to Weiyuan, and 3,000 yuan to Zhangxian from the central relief funds, and ordered them to be remitted separately for emergency relief.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, Chairman Yu previously telegraphed the Economic Commission to send survey team leader Liu Rusong to lead a team to the west. The survey of the Lanwu section has been completed. The construction costs required have been repeatedly telegraphed to the Economic Commission for allocation in order to start construction. Approval has been received to allocate 200,000 yuan in construction funds in the 25th year to start construction on the Gaolan to Yongdeng section. It is planned to start from Hekou on the north bank of the Yellow River, 90 li west of Lanzhou, along the east bank of the Zhuanglang River to Yongdeng County, with a total length of more than 140 li. For all construction matters, the Provincial Government has hired Liu Rusong as the chief engineer, responsible for carrying out supervision and guidance, and established a Gansu-Xinjiang Highway Engineering Office, which has been organized and officially established.</p>
<p>The afforestation project along the Yellow River in Gansu Province is extremely important for downstream flooding and safety. The Provincial Government has commissioned Fan Shuxin to survey the actual situation. However, the implementation period and method of afforestation must be tested first before implementation. It has been decided to conduct a trial planting in another area using the stem-burying method in late autumn this year. After the trial is successful, implementation will begin next year according to the planned plan. As for the trial area, Yantan and other places have been selected, and work will begin soon.</p>
<p>The section of the roadbed at Duanjia Archway and East Xiaoshunmen in this city was previously decided by the Provincial Government to be widened to facilitate traffic. A notice was issued to the residents in the area to comply with the designated boundaries, demolish and retreat their houses, and complete the demolition and retreat by September 25 in order to start construction. It is learned that the residents in the area have complied with the designated boundaries and completed the demolition and retreat. Construction will begin within days.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Land Tax Penalty Extension for Half a Month</h3>
<p>The first installment of land price tax for the 25th year in this county was levied from August 15th to the 14th of this month, a period of two months. Regulations stipulate that a late payment penalty should be levied for exceeding the deadline. County Chief Guo, considering that the number of collections within the deadline was small, extended the penalty period by half a month to show compassion for the people. Approval has been obtained and a notice has been issued to inform the public.</p>
<h3>Huangdu: Robbery of Farmhouses</h3>
<p>On the night of the 19th, eight bandits, speaking in Hakka dialect and holding electric torches and pistols, broke into the home of farmer Liu Guiquan near Huangdu Town in the Second District. Two people stood guard outside, and the rest entered the room to rob. They left after a while. After checking the losses, it was estimated that jewelry, clothing, cloth, chickens, ducks, and other items worth a total of 100 yuan in legal currency were taken.</p>
<h3>Fengxian: Request to Reduce Fares at the Minhang Ferry</h3>
<p>Yesterday, on the Fengxian Pubei section, which is the opposite shore of Minhang, the ferry sank into the Pu River due to carrying too many passengers, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 ferry passengers. Seeing this, Diao Yebai and other people from all walks of life in the county specially petitioned the Construction Department to ban old ferries and request Minhang Ferry to reduce fares so that farmers can safely take the ferry, so as not to greedily seek cheapness and cause accidents.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Strike Wave Subsides</h3>
<p>Shops in the area near Yinglong Town shed outside the West Gate of this county were agitated by a dispute over market scales and canal scales over a purchase of one yuan of fresh crabs by the cook of the Yinglong Orange Police Station of the Fourth Public Security Bureau at the Yan Yun Ji fish shop, arousing public anger and causing a strike. It is learned that after this incident occurred, the town chief of the area, Chen Nianzu, and the district chief of the First District, Qian Zhongliang, reported to the Public Security Bureau. Director Zhang met them and promised to find a way to mediate. He immediately ordered inspectors Chen Hoyu and Patrol Officer Tong to go to persuade them to resume business. At the same time, he placed the cook Yin Ada under surveillance and sent him to the headquarters for interrogation. At the same time, Zhang ordered the Fourth Bureau to release Xu Dequan, the bookkeeper of Yan Yun Ji, the employees Qin Ating and Chen Asan, and the bystander Shen Ating, who were detained that night. The matter was settled. On the morning of the 24th, the striking shops in the area all opened for business and resumed normal operations.</p>
<h3>Breaking Up a Morphine Den</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Director Zhang Da received a secret report yesterday stating that there was a private morphine injection den in a dilapidated house next to the Zhuang Ding team at No. 10 Jia, West Street, Qianzhou Town, Ninth District, and requested that the police be dispatched to arrest them. After receiving the report, Zhang immediately ordered Inspector Gu Jiafeng to lead the police to search the countryside. Upon arriving at the destination, they saw Tang Sanbao, Bian Caigen, and Tang Wenqi all injecting morphine, so they were all arrested. A morphine needle was seized from Tang Sanbao's hand, and a small package of morphine was found under a broken mat. They were immediately taken to the bureau and transferred to the county government for transfer to the Second District Security Command for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Red Cross Malaria Eradication Team Departs</h3>
<p>In the Fifth and Sixth Districts here, malignant malaria has been prevalent recently, and deaths have followed one after another. Farmers have shallow knowledge and often rely on superstitious worship of ghosts and gods instead of fundamental treatment, which has led to extremely rapid spread. In view of this, the Red Cross Society has specially joined forces with the Western Medical Association to organize a malaria eradication team, with the Red Cross responsible for economic medicines and the physicians responsible for treatment. The first team has already departed, with doctors Zhou Tianlai, Yu Jishi, Shao Yufan, Huang Chengxi, and Zhu Bingwen appointed to be responsible for diagnosis, and Red Cross staff members Shi Shouzhi, Huang Tongwei, and Chen Xiaomei also sent to assist. They went to Zhitang, Xijiashi, and Lao Wushi on the 24th, and are expected to return to the city in three days, after which a second team will be sent.</p>
<h3>County Government Urges Grain Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The county government has now begun to collect the first installment of field tax for the 25th year, but more than ten days after the start of the collection, the amount collected is zero. The reasons for this are nothing more than the serious situation, the proliferation of rumors, and the fact that those who do not understand the situation are watching each other. However, the county government needs a large amount of funds at this time. If the taxes are not collected, how can it be maintained? On the 23rd, it summoned all businesses in the urban area and ordered them to pay within a limited time. At the same time, grain cabinet staff members Zhu Zhenxia, Song Aizhi, Gu Yansheng, Zhou Quan, and Shi Jiagan were dispatched to various rural areas to collect taxes from the rural businesses within a limited time to meet urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Petition to Reduce the Amount of Grain Storage</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce believes that the grain storage allocation standards in this province are too burdensome for merchants. They have repeatedly received telegrams from more than 20 counties, including Quxian, Wukang, Jinhua, Jiaxing, Yiwu, Jiashan, Tongxiang, Shangyu, Shaoxing, and Lanxi, requesting relief. After being transferred to the provincial government, they were disapproved. The Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees decided to publicly elect Chairman Jin Runquan, Committee Members Xie Hucheng, Zhou Yangsong, Lu Chujue, Chen Qinshi, and Xu Xinggong, and eight others as representatives to visit Xu Qingfu of the Civil Affairs Department at 11:00 AM on the 24th to report everything and request a slight change. Xu met them personally, and the result was quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou-Shan Road Station Opens for Business</h3>
<p>The entire line of the Hangzhou-Shan Road, including the road surface and bridges, has been completed and has been submitted to the Construction Department for inspection. As for the location of stations along the route, the Operations Section Chief of the First District Management Office has conducted an inspection and decided to set up 11 stations: Hangzhou, Qingtai Dou, Qibao, Qiaosi, Linping, Chongde, Xiangxiang, Puyuan, Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Fengjing. In the future, it is planned to run a direct bus once a day between Hangzhou and Fengjing, and a local bus once each between Chonghang and Chongjia. Because the inspection still requires considerable procedures and the bridges also need to be repaired, it will not be possible to open for business until November 10.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Epidemic Trend in Tongru Declines</h3>
<p>Malignant malaria in Nantong and Rugao counties has spread over a wide area. After diagnosis and treatment by the epidemic prevention team, it has recently shown a peaceful state and fewer deaths. The epidemic prevention team has divided the epidemic area into several units, and each team of doctors is diagnosing and injecting in turn according to the Baojia households every day. After each township is completed, the mountain township chief inspects each household to completely eliminate the epidemic. Within a week, the epidemic can be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: We have just read the news in your newspaper on the 21st of this month, "Smuggling Ronin Cause Disturbance at Jinan Station," which stated that customs officials "evaded in advance," "fled empty-handed," and that "Director Lin Lemin also avoided and dared not go to the station," etc., which differs slightly from the facts. On the afternoon of the 18th, at 4:30 PM, five customs officers from our office, along with police officers, seized two cars of smuggled goods at Luokou National Bridge and transported the smuggled goods back to the Jinpu Freight Yard in order to transport them to Beijing. At the same time, the smuggling ronin were handed over to the police officers at the yard for handling. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 PM, when inspector Liu Maoyun, who was on the night shift, was working, more than 100 ronin suddenly gathered, armed with weapons, and rushed to the office, forcing them to hand over the seized goods. Inspector Liu politely reasoned with them, but the ronin did not allow any explanation and violently beat him, causing him to faint and lose consciousness. They also sent people to monitor him. After receiving the report, our director immediately rushed to the Public Security Bureau and sent people to the military and police agencies for assistance, but no effective assistance was obtained. At the same time, dozens of ronin took five cars to our residence at the China Travel Service guest house and violently beat customs officers Gao Zongqi and Zhang Jiakun, then forcibly dragged them to Jinpu Station and forced them to return the seized goods, stating that they would not release them unless the seized goods were returned. The three beaten customs officers, along with our director, were trying to negotiate with the military, police, and Japanese consular police, but the smuggling ronin were unreasonable and insisted on returning the seized goods. Then, the Inspector Li of the Public Security Bureau strongly advised them to avoid escalating the situation and to rescue the three beaten customs officers. They had no choice but to temporarily agree to hand over the seized goods to the Japanese Consulate for safekeeping, and the Japanese Consulate issued an official receipt. The above is a rough situation. We are deeply afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth and will not forgive us. Therefore, we specially write this letter to correct the record. We hope that you will publish it. Sincerely, Jinan Inspection Office for Preventing Smuggling on the Road, Customs. October 23rd.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: The news about the Changshu Prison published in your newspaper on October 15th contains many inaccuracies. In the past, our prison seemed to be slightly lax in its management, such as allowing prisoners to arbitrarily drink alcohol and smoke. After the new warden Gong took office, he immediately rectified and prohibited these bad habits. At the same time, several thieves violated the rules, and for prevention, they were all shackled, which caused resentment. During breakfast on the——3rd, several thieves restricted the food intake of the majority. After the warden advised them, the turmoil subsided immediately. It lasted only a few minutes, and there was no reduction in food rations as reported. We are writing this letter to state the facts and ask that you publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Changshu County Prison. October 19th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Celebrates with Flag-Raising: All Circles Present Airplanes as Birthday Gifts; Naming Ceremony Held Yesterday; Mayor Wu Led the Ceremony; Airplane Performance Concluded with Flight to Hangzhou; 150,000 Spectators</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the "Zhongzheng Team" airplane naming ceremony, organized by the committee commemorating Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday and funded by donations from all sectors of the city to present airplanes to the government, took place at the Longhua Airport. Numerous representatives from various groups attended. Mayor Wu and others delivered speeches, and after the naming ceremony, air force pilots performed demonstrations. Approximately 150,000 people from Shanghai flocked to watch, and the entire city celebrated by raising flags. The unprecedented enthusiasm is recorded below.</p>
<p>On Longhua Road</p>
<p>The autumn sky was high and clear, with a gentle and warm breeze. Yesterday afternoon, Longhua Road was almost entirely enveloped in an atmosphere of excitement. The fervent enthusiasm of the entire citizenry towards aviation was evident on the face of every citizen. From Jingji Road, across Jingji Bridge, and all the way to the airport, spanning over ten li, Longhua Station was filled with people from 12:00 PM, braving the journey and walking to participate in the airplane presentation and birthday celebration naming ceremony. People rubbed shoulders and bumped elbows. Cars, bicycles, and rickshaws were connected and winding together, losing their ability to speed. Armed police officers tasked with maintaining traffic safety exhausted their abilities, carefully managing the various vehicles and strictly enforcing traffic regulations. Along the road, national flags were hung in front of every residence, shadowed by green trees, creating a unique atmosphere. Public buses traveling between Ximen and Longhua, and special trains running from the South Station to Longhua, were filled to the brim on every trip. By 2:00 PM, the roads became even more congested. The traffic at Tianyao Bridge was completely blocked. Even Mayor Wu's vehicle could not move forward, so he and his wife got out of the car and walked. The crowd at the airport only began to disperse at 7:00 PM, truly an unprecedented spectacle.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The main entrance of the venue was decorated with a tall, colorful archway made of pine and cypress. Party and national flags were placed on the left and right sides, and a red silk banner with gold characters reading "Shanghai City Airplane Presentation and Birthday Celebration Naming Ceremony" was hung in the middle. The venue was surrounded by iron fences. The entrance to the special ticket area was in front of the Eurasia Company office, and the entrance to the general ticket area was in front of the Cement Factory Road. Both entrances had registration books, and personnel from the airplane presentation committee collected tickets. The standing areas for special and general ticket holders were separated by red and green cloth. A platform facing south was set up in the center of the venue, surrounded by red cloth, with a red silk banner hanging above. In the middle of the platform hung a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and a photograph of Chairman Chiang. Ten airplanes were parked in a line on the empty space in front of the platform. The nose of each plane was covered with a party and national flag. Pilots stood on both sides of each plane. The planes were surrounded by ropes, guarded by security police, to prevent spectators from approaching. Inside and outside the venue, public security bureau police officers, security team police officers, and Boy Scouts from the Boy Scout Council maintained order. Although there were many people, order was maintained because all areas were separated by red and green cloth. Loudspeakers were set up in the venue to broadcast speeches.</p>
<p>Ten Airplanes Fly to Shanghai</p>
<p>The ten fighter planes purchased by Shanghai arrived in Shanghai at the beginning of this month. However, due to the lack of a suitable airport, they flew to Hangzhou and landed at the aviation school. Yesterday, to attend the naming ceremony, the planes took off in formation from Hangzhou at 10:00 AM and arrived in Shanghai at noon. They landed at Longhua Airport to await the naming ceremony.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Among those present yesterday were Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Central Committee member Chu Minyi, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan Tan Zhen, President of Jiaotong University Li Zhaohuan, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Aviation Commission representative Huang Bingheng, Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Peihuang, and representatives from various groups, including Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Zhou Xuexiang, Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, Sun Qiuping, Yao Xijiu, Huang Zhaoxiong, Xie Zhongfu, Zhu Zigao, Tong Xingbai, Zhang Shouyong, Bei Songsun, Zhang Xiaolin, Mao Heyuan, and Gu Xinyi. The presidium consisted of fifteen people: Wu Tiecheng, Cai Jingjun, Yang Hu, Song Xilian, Zhang Shouyong, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Zhu Zigao, Sun Qiuping, Gu Xinyi, Huang Zhaoxiong, Li Zicai, and Tong Xingbai. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony, which included: (1) playing music, (2) singing the Party anthem, (3) paying the highest respect to the Party and national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, (4) the chairman reverently reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, (5) the chairman delivering an opening address, (6) speeches, and (7) holding the naming ceremony and aerial performance.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, as chairman, first gave a speech, saying, "Members of the presidium, citizens, more than 100,000 people from Shanghai are gathered here today to attend the airplane presentation and naming ceremony, an unprecedented event for the city of Shanghai, demonstrating the respect and sincerity of the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai towards our leader. The ten airplanes presented as birthday gifts are named: Shanghai Municipal Government, Shanghai Party Headquarters, Shanghai Police, Shanghai Business, Shanghai Anti-Smoking, Shanghai Ningbo, Shanghai Training Students, Shanghai Tourism, Shanghai Grains, and Shanghai Xiangchengyi, forming the Zhongzheng Team. After the naming ceremony, the Zhongzheng Team will fly to the capital, carrying the respect and enthusiasm of all the citizens of Shanghai to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. Chairman Chiang completed the great task of the National Revolution and unification, laying the foundation for China's prosperity and strength. The people should respect and honor meritorious deeds, expressing a unified respect and enthusiasm nationwide. In these extremely difficult times, the citizens of Shanghai can still enthusiastically donate money to purchase airplanes to celebrate birthdays, strengthen national defense, and advocate patriotism and love for the leader nationwide. This unprecedented and fervent expression undoubtedly demonstrates the determination of Shanghai's 3.5 million citizens to concentrate all their efforts to support the leader, overcome national difficulties, revive the nation, and build a new China to establish itself in the world today. Without national defense, there is no way to maintain the survival of the nation and people. If China has no national defense, or its national defense is insufficient, its nation and people are in danger of extinction. The air force is the greatest power of national defense. In China today, to build national defense, it is especially necessary to strengthen the air force. National defense must concentrate the spiritual and material strength of the entire nation to build and strengthen it. Therefore, national construction, such as education, industry, agriculture, and mining, must be centered on national defense. Only in this way will its construction be nationalistic, and only nationalistic construction can maintain the nation's survival. Therefore, China's construction today is nationalistic construction, and China's national defense today is defensive national defense. China's self-defense is to seek China's security, maintain peace in East Asia, and protect world peace. These are the highest responsibilities and obligations of mankind, which the Chinese people should thoroughly recognize and make positive contributions to the security of China and the peace of East Asia and the world. The significance of today's airplane presentation and birthday celebration lies in this."</p>

<p>Huang Bingheng's Speech</p>
<p>Huang Bingheng, representative of the Aviation Commission, said, "Today, the citizens of Shanghai are holding an airplane presentation and naming ceremony. I am very honored to participate on behalf of the Aviation Commission. This nationwide campaign of purchasing airplanes and donating money demonstrates the people's fervent admiration for the national leader. This campaign was led by Mayor Wu and initiated by various groups. Shanghai has 3.5 million people and is the economic center of the country. Its every move can serve as a model for the whole country. I hope Mayor Wu will continue to lead the country to strive forward in national defense construction and the aviation industry. Today, more than 100,000 citizens are participating, which shows that after the January 28th Incident, the people have a general understanding of aviation and national defense. Chairman Chiang has been working hard for the people and the country since he set out from Guangzhou ten years ago, which is admired by the people. Now that Chairman Chiang is celebrating his 50th birthday and the country is unified, I hope he will lead the people to use the power of unity to strive for construction, abolish unequal treaties, and embark on the road to revival. The ten airplanes presented by the citizens of Shanghai have been organized into the Zhongzheng Team.

<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said, "This year is the 25th year of the Republic of China, and also Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. The date falls on the third week after National Day, which is a sign that his birth is not accidental. Considering the ancient tradition of celebrating centenarian birthdays, the age of fifty is like the 'sun at its zenith,' and it can also symbolize that although the country is in difficult and troubled times, with this great pillar supporting the central government, the country's fate will surely advance without end. People from all walks of life across the country, in order to express their gratitude to Chairman Chiang for his tireless efforts, have donated money to purchase airplanes to present to the government to commemorate Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. The airplanes purchased with the funds collected in this city are numbered as ten. Today, we are holding a naming ceremony. As a citizen and as a member of the organizing committee for purchasing airplanes to celebrate birthdays, I cannot remain silent. I would like to say a word to the citizens of the entire city. In the past, the State of Lu in the Spring and Autumn Period was a weak country, often bullied by Qi and Chu. The 'Bi Gong' chapter of the 'Lu Song' was written to celebrate Duke Xi of Lu's birthday. The reason for celebrating Duke Xi was that they said, 'May you live ten thousand years, may your longevity be without end.' The reason for celebrating the State of Lu was that they said, 'If Jing and Shu are punished, then no one will dare to accept us.' In modern terms, it means that foreigners dare not bully us. It can be seen that a country must reach a point where foreigners dare not bully it before it can encounter a birthday celebration and raise a glass in celebration. However, the people of Lu at that time used 'a thousand chariots of state and thirty thousand soldiers' to celebrate Duke Xi and the State of Lu. Chariots are war chariots, and soldiers are soldiers. Only when the people can use war chariots and soldiers to celebrate the country can they achieve a situation where the State of Lu, although weak, can survive. Our purchase of airplanes to celebrate birthdays today has the same goal as the 'Lu Song.' Therefore, to achieve the same goal as the 'Lu Song,' taking 'a thousand chariots of state and thirty thousand soldiers' as an example, there should be at least a thousand airplanes and thirty thousand pilots. The current stage we have reached is still far from the intended goal. Currently, there is an initiative in this city's newspapers to launch a 'contribute to the country for one day' campaign. The members of the Chamber of Commerce have first decided to actively promote it. I, in my capacity as Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, formally propose that all sectors strive to promote this national salvation 'one day' campaign. If farmers, industrialists, merchants, and students across the country can use one day's income to purchase airplanes and celebrate birthdays, I hope that compatriots across the country will rise up and not neglect this 'one day,' and gather the strength of 450 million people to establish the national foundation of the Republic of China for billions of years. Let us start this endeavor today."</p>
<p>Speeches from All Sides</p>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu said, "Chairman Chiang is the leader of the Party and the country. His life's efforts have been entirely for the Party and the country. Therefore, presenting airplanes to Chairman Chiang is presenting them to the Party and the country." Training Commander Song Xilian said, "Among the ten airplanes, there is a Training Team, which was donated by the city's training students. Of the hundreds of thousands of students in the city, only the training students have this expression, because they have a complete organization." Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Headquarters said, "When Chairman Chiang celebrates his birthday, the people of the country celebrate in two ways: materially and spiritually. Chairman Chiang is the leader of the country, and his responsibility is to defend the country. Therefore, the best material gift is airplanes, which can strengthen national defense. As for the spiritual aspect, I hope that the people of the country will fully contribute their talents and spirits and work together to save the country." Mayor Wu then reported that the Catholic Church in China had also donated 50,000 yuan under the order of the Archbishop to present airplanes as birthday gifts. Lu Bohong then said, "The Catholic Church in China, under the order of the Pope's representative, has donated 50,000 yuan to purchase two ambulance planes to contribute to the government, to express the gratitude of the nation's 3.5 million Catholics to the national leader."</p>
<p>Naming Ceremony Ritual</p>
<p>After the speeches, Mayor Wu and his wife, and the representatives who named each airplane, stepped off the ceremony platform and marched to the venue led by the military band to conduct the naming ceremony. 1. Shanghai Municipal Government: Mayor Wu and his wife. 2. Shanghai Party Headquarters: Tong Xingbai and his wife. 3. Shanghai Anti-Smoking: Du Yuesheng and his wife. 4. Shanghai Business: Wang Xiaolai and his wife. 5. Shanghai Police: Cai Jingjun and his wife. 6. Shanghai Tourism: Sun Qiuping and his wife. 7. Shanghai Ningbo: Yu Qiaqing and Mao Heyuan's wife. 8.

After the representatives who named each airplane took a group photo in front of the airplane, the party and national flag emblem covering the airplane's nose was removed amidst the sound of music, marking the completion of the ceremony. The engines were started in preparation for the aerial performance.</p>
<p>Aerial Performance</p>
<p>The Zhongzheng Team planes were flown by team leader Li Dan, deputy team leader Liu Zhihan, and team members Fan Jinhan, Gong Yeyi, Liu Zhesheng, Tan Wen, Wang Kai, Zhang Xiaoliang, Wang Yuanbo, and Liu Shufan. All the pilots were dressed in air force uniforms and stood by their planes. After the naming ceremony, they got into their planes, started the engines, and planes one through nine, led by team leader Li, passed in front of the classic ceremony platform, circled to the west of the venue, and sped southeast, taking off into the air. After circling the venue once, they formed three small teams, with one team in the lead and two teams following on the left and right rear, flying low over the venue. Then, the nine planes formed a character "人" (person) and flew high overhead. Later, they formed the character "一" (one) and flew forward in a straight line. When they reached the airspace above the venue, they rolled to one side and descended, forming a ring and flying several circles, then flying low over the ground one by one. Their movements were agile and their order was impeccable. As for plane number ten, flown by Liu Zhihan, it performed independently: 1. Continuous somersaults, 2. Continuous slow rolls, fast rolls, 3. British hat slow turns, 4. Inverted flight, 5. Ascending slow rolls, 6. Wingover, 7. Dive, etc. The high level of skill impressed the audience. At about 4:00 PM, the planes formed a team and flew south back to Hangzhou, planning to fly to Beijing on the 31st to participate in the birthday celebration and airplane presentation. Various groups in this city will send representatives to attend.</p>
<p>Another Performance</p>
<p>In order to promote interest in civil aviation, the organizers specially invited female aviator Li Xiaqing to perform at the venue before the naming ceremony. Yesterday, the lady wore a white canvas flight suit and circulated among the guests, with elegant demeanor, which attracted much attention. Before the ceremony, the sound of an engine was heard, and a yellow-winged "Fleet" training aircraft took off to perform, landing only after about a quarter of an hour. The plane was piloted by Zhang Shouchun, a member of the China Flying Club, and instructor Chen Xiayun. The altitude reached more than 2,400 feet. Zhang is a graduate of the Hong Kong Aviation School. Then, Ms. Li and instructor Yang Zhaofan flew another aircraft of the same type, ascending and flying low, circling the venue several times and performing techniques such as inverted flight and somersaults, which were quite impressive. After getting out of the plane, the lady went to the ceremony platform to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<p>Total Number of Airplanes Presented</p>
<p>The Central Aviation Commission specially sent Huang Bingheng to Shanghai to participate in the naming of the Zhongzheng Team airplanes in Shanghai. Mr. Huang returned to Beijing last night after attending the ceremony. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency interviewed Mr. Huang yesterday. According to him, the total number of airplanes obtained from the provinces and cities that launched the campaign to purchase airplanes to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday is more than sixty. The central government has notified them separately to fly the presented airplanes to Beijing on the 29th to prepare for the grand presentation ceremony on the 31st.</p>

A star falls in Guangdong, and the sun and moon lose their light. The Party loses its defender, and the country loses its pillar. All of us Chinese people are filled with grief, raising our heads to the south and shedding tears on our clothes. The national crisis is deepening, and the whole country is alarmed. Internal stability and external resistance, resisting aggression and saving the country, expanding our influence and straightening out our affairs, all depend on virtuous and capable people. In one sudden death, who will correct the discipline? Now, on the occasion of the national funeral, the ceremony is magnificent, the tomb is lush, and the cemetery trees are verdant. The tomb is high, and the tombstone stands on the Dragon Hill. Burying loyalty in the Guangdong Mountains, it will be passed down for eternity. Peace and tranquility have been achieved, and the legacy will be long. It will be immortal for centuries, forever preserving the boundless. Alas, may you rest in peace!"</p>
<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Association Held Its Annual Meeting Yesterday, Approving Various Reports and Re-electing Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association held its annual meeting yesterday at 3:30 PM on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, reporting on association affairs and re-electing directors and supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Those present yesterday included Mayor Wu (represented by Li Ting'an), Li Ting'an, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Hu Shuyi), Cai Jingjun (represented by Chen Changqing), Gan Xiaolai (represented by Shi Menglan), Ji Zhangjian (represented by Du Hesheng), Wu Yun Chu (represented by Fang Zhicheng), Lei Kenan representing the Social Bureau, Zhu Jiarang representing the New Life Movement, Liu Wenlin representing the Child Welfare Association, members Yan Fuqing, Yuan Haiping, Xu Xinru, Cao Yongzheng, Yang Hao, and over a hundred others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>After formal greetings, Chairman Wu Tiecheng, represented by Li Ting'an, delivered an address, briefly stating: "The harm caused by tuberculosis is most alarming. Every year, over a hundred thousand people in our country die from tuberculosis, and more than ten million are bedridden due to the disease. There are also tens of millions of others who have not been properly surveyed. Suffering from this disease leads to physical weakness and mental depression. We firmly believe that if we want to revive our nation, we must pay attention to the health of the people. Given the circumstances of our nation, tuberculosis prevention is an essential task for realizing public health. Although our association is dedicated to tuberculosis prevention, its real mission is to promote the health of the nation. We now have this organization in Shanghai, and we will expand it to the whole country in the future. Especially during this critical period of national crisis, when the entire nation is united and striving for national revival, we should pay more attention and make greater efforts in important work related to national health, such as tuberculosis prevention."</p>
<p>Representatives' Addresses</p>
<p>Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan, representing Hu Shuyi, delivered an address, briefly stating: "Tuberculosis prevention is an important task for promoting national health. Efforts to prevent tuberculosis can be considered from two aspects: First, in terms of knowledge, to make everyone aware of the dangers of tuberculosis and the importance of its prevention. Second, in terms of habits, to help everyone develop good hygienic practices, such as spitting and dietary habits, which will yield significant results. The flourishing of industry and commerce and the growth of population in this city make tuberculosis prevention particularly important. Recognizing the alarming spread of tuberculosis in urban areas, we have established this organization. In the future, the education, commercial, industrial, and social bureau sectors are willing to cooperate to promote tuberculosis prevention." Cai Jingjun, representing Chen Changqing, delivered an address, briefly stating: "Our country is regarded by the world as the 'Sick Man of East Asia.' Although enlightened people and government authorities have been promoting hygiene, many ignorant people are still mired in superstition, which has not yielded great results. Therefore, we should focus on breaking down superstitions and promoting proper scientific hygiene methods. Tuberculosis is a serious threat to our nation, and your association's dedication to tuberculosis prevention is truly saving the nation." Ding Huikang also gave a speech, which is omitted here.</p>
<p>Three-Year Plan</p>
<p>After reports from various working committees, Yan Fuqing reported on future work plans, briefly stating: "Our association has been established for three years, and most of our past work has focused on promotion. In the future, we should focus on the implementation of practical work. This practical work should start with projects that meet the needs of the majority of people and provide the most benefits. We often see that diseases such as cholera and leprosy, due to their ease of transmission, lead to general attention to prevention. However, the transmission of tuberculosis is even easier than that of cholera and leprosy. Whether in the milk of humans, cattle, or sheep, or in other foods and in the air, it is very easy to transmit. Recent doctor's surveys show that 80 to 90 percent of children aged from birth to twelve have the disease's root. Sometimes, because the body is relatively healthy, it is not discovered. However, if the body is slightly out of balance or not properly protected, the symptoms of the disease can appear. Although our association is limited by funding, I plan to focus on the following projects in the next three years, selecting those that are more economical and more important: (1) Children's health camp. This project requires limited time and less funding, and its benefits to children are significant. (2) Establish two new clinics each year, with an expected total of six in three years. Those who are not ill or only mildly ill will be examined. Tuberculosis in the second or third stage not only costs a lot of money, but it is also difficult to cure. (3) Establish sanatoriums. The city's sanatoriums have only 350 beds, but in reality, 3,500 are not enough. Nine-tenths of tuberculosis patients cannot get proper care. Although setting up sanatoriums is costly, it will depend on future financial capabilities."</p>
<p>Improve Dining</p>
<p>Then, a proposal was discussed. Peng Wenying proposed a discussion on the method of improving dining habits. The reason is that the original Chinese dining method, where everyone uses chopsticks and spoons to take food from the same bowl, is more dangerous than spitting if someone at the table has tuberculosis. The proposed method is to organize a research association to improve dining habits and request the authorities to renovate public dining places in accordance with the law. It was unanimously approved and referred to the next board of directors for implementation.</p>
<p>Re-election of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Finally, directors and supervisors were re-elected. The list is as follows: (Directors) Wu Tiecheng, Lu Bohong, Li Ting'an, Yan Fuqing, Weng Zhilong, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Heqin, Wang Xiaoying, J.H. Jordan, Liu Hongsheng, Li Fuzhuo, Lu Ganchen, Huang Renzhi, Lin Kanghou, Gu Yuqi, Zhu Qinglan, Wu Yunchu, Li Denghui, Guo Shun, Xu Jianping, Xu Shiying, Dong Xianguang, Hu Yunqiu, Li Zuwei, Jin Shuchu, Lu Yongchun, Feng Shaoshan, Diao Xinde, Chen Zhifang, Li Dachao, Tan Shixin, Hu Guanming, Song Guobin, Qian Muhan, Cai Jingjun, Zhu Shaoping, Yu Zuoting, Liang Xiaochu, Cai Xiangsun, J. Rabaute, Liu Rui'en, S.M. Garnn, Zhang Zhijiang, Chu Minyi, Xiang Longxun, Chen Guangfu, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Liande, Mrs. Xiao Zhiji, Zhu Hengbi, Zhou Bangjun, Liu Wang Liming, Ouyang Huichong. (Standing Directors) Lu Bohong, Li Ting'an, Yan Fuqing, Weng Zhilong, Huang Zifang, Chen Heqin, Wu Tiecheng, Joel Ten, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaoying, Shi Enming. (Supervisors) Du Yuesheng, Pang Jingzhou, Ding Fubao, Qian Xinzhi, Yao Mulian, Liu Zhanen, Yu Qiaqing.</p>

<p>Following British approval of China-America's establishment of a station in Hong Kong, the first trial flight of a direct China-America flight arrived in Longhua at 5:00 PM yesterday from Hong Kong, carrying seven people who departed from the United States, including the General Manager of Pan-Pacific Airlines, Trippe, and the Chairman of the Board, Whituery. Trippe and others are the first to arrive in China directly from the United States via commercial airlines. Regular joint flights between China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and Pan-Pacific Airlines will begin next month. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency provides the following details:</p>
<p>Completion of the China-America Route</p>
<p>With the approval from the British side for the establishment of a station in Hong Kong, the China-America air route will soon be fully operational. Trippe, the General Manager of Pan-Pacific Airlines, Whituery, the Chairman of the Board, and Best, the company's Far East Manager, departed from the United States this month aboard the "Clipper" aircraft. They arrived in the Philippines some days ago, and after obtaining permission from the Hong Kong authorities via telegram, departed from the Philippines to Hong Kong via Macau the day before. Trippe and his party then took the "Fujian" and "Guangdong" aircraft from Hong Kong yesterday morning at 8:30 AM and 9:00 AM, respectively, to Shanghai, completing the full China-America flight.</p>
<p>Arrival of Two Managers in Shanghai</p>
<p>After departing from Hong Kong, Howard, the Far East Manager of the Associated Press, and McGatto, the Manila Manager of Pan-Pacific Airlines, arrived in Shanghai at 4:15 PM aboard the "Fujian" aircraft. Trippe and his wife, the General Manager of Pan-Pacific Airlines, Whituery, the Chairman of the Board, and Best and his wife, the Far East Manager of Pan-Pacific Airlines, arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM aboard the "Guangdong" aircraft. Those who came to welcome them included Huang Jiangquan, Chairman of China National Aviation Corporation, Dai Enji, General Manager, Ericsson, Chief Engineer, Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Flight Group, and Huang Baoxian, Director of the Business Group, among others.</p>
<p>Passengers Flying Across the Pacific</p>
<p>Flying Over 10,000 Miles</p>
<p>Trippe and his party traveled 13,194 kilometers on this trial flight of the China-America direct route. With this test flight, the China-America line is fully completed. According to reports, there are 78 stations on the route from the United States to China, with the main landing stations including Honolulu and Midway Island. The distance from Los Angeles to Honolulu is 3,862 kilometers, from Honolulu to Midway Island is 2,220 kilometers, from Midway Island to Wake Island is 1,837 kilometers, from Wake Island to Guam is 2,860 kilometers, from Guam to the Philippines is 2,413 kilometers, from the Philippines to Hong Kong is 1,271 kilometers, and from Hong Kong to Shanghai is 1,448 kilometers, totaling 13,194 kilometers. Completing the entire route takes approximately twelve days.</p>
<p>Foreign Media Coverage</p>
<p>The Evening Post of America reported that the first group of passengers on the regular air route from the United States to the Far East will arrive at the Longhua Airport at approximately 4:30 PM today (the 24th). They crossed the Pacific Ocean on a Pan American Airlines aircraft from Alameda, California, passing through Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, Guam, Manila, and Macau before arriving in Hong Kong. The flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai will be on a Douglas Dolphin aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation. Among them are Mr. and Mrs. Trippe, the General Manager of Pan American Airlines, Mr. Biggsby, the Vice President of the Far East of the company, Mr. and Mrs. Whitely, the Chairman of the Board of the company, Mr. Howard, the General Manager and Editor-in-Chief of the New York World-Telegram, and Mr. Morris, the Far East Manager of the Associated Press. The Trippes, the Whitelys, and Howard departed from California, while Biggsby and Morris joined in Manila. McGatto, the former Secretary of the Treasury during President Wilson's administration, went to Hong Kong to await the return of the Philippine Clipper to the United States and will take it back to the country. Mr. Rudd, the Manila Manager of Pan American Airlines, also attached to Hong Kong from Manila, but did not come to Shanghai. Today, two aircraft of China National Aviation Corporation will arrive at Longhua Airport from Hong Kong in the afternoon. One aircraft carrying passengers flying across the Pacific is expected to arrive at 4:30 PM, and the other is a regular Guangdong-Shanghai flight that stopped briefly in Hong Kong, arriving at approximately 3:30 PM, carrying Biggsby and ordinary passengers. The passengers flying across the Pacific will stay in Shanghai until tomorrow or the day after, taking a trip to the new capital and the ancient capital, and then returning to the United States via the original route. This is the first group of passengers flying the Pacific Ocean on a commercial aircraft to arrive in Shanghai. The Philippine Clipper aircraft previously only flew to Manila, but is now flying from Manila to Macau for the first time, and then to Hong Kong. The expansion of the trans-Pacific air route from Manila via Macau to Hong Kong is a new era for commercial aviation. Not only is it convenient for passengers, but also airmail between Shanghai and San Francisco can be accelerated. Previously, airmail from Shanghai to the United States had to be shipped to Manila and then transported by plane, but now the entire journey is by air, which will be much faster than before.</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency's dispatch from Shanghai on the 24th, Howard, the Editor-in-Chief of the New York World-Telegram, arrived at the Longhua seaplane port from Hong Kong on a China National Aviation Corporation aircraft at 4:00 PM this afternoon, making him one of the fastest people to travel from a major American city to a major Chinese city. Howard departed from New York, in the eastern United States, on a transcontinental aircraft on October 12th at 5:10 PM and flew to Alameda in the west. He then took the Philippine Clipper, participating in the first passenger flight across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Illness Is Out of Danger</p>
<p>Due to the Treatment by Fan Shisheng, According to the Central News Agency, Huang Fu, the former Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Peiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, who was previously ill, has been out of danger after being treated by traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Fan Shisheng. However, after a long illness, he still needs time to recover. The Central News Agency reporter met with Huang's attendants yesterday and inquired about Huang's condition. It was said that Huang returned to Shanghai from Mogan Mountain in the summer, and his old illness relapsed. He was admitted to the Hong En Hospital for treatment. Because Huang's illness was very complicated, in order to understand his condition and diagnose the root cause, he underwent surgery in the hospital on September 14, and it was determined that Huang was suffering from liver cancer. However, there is no effective drug for liver cancer in modern global medicine. Afterwards, his consciousness became confused, and he was in critical condition. The doctors at the hospital believed that there was no hope of recovery. They then learned that traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Fan Shisheng was proficient in medicine. Through a friend's introduction, he flew from Lushan to Shanghai on September 28 to treat Huang, believing that there was still hope of recovery. He treated Huang twice a day. Currently, Huang's condition has gone from complex to simple, the dangerous period has passed, his consciousness has cleared, and his spirit has gradually recovered. He can now talk for one or two hours, which is a significant improvement compared to before. However, there is more than 2,000 units of fluid in Huang's abdomen (due to Huang absorbing approximately 900 to 1,000 units of water per day, while only 500 to 600 units are discharged, resulting in daily accumulation), which urgently needs to be drained. Therefore, Dr. Fan administered a diuretic (traditional Chinese medicine) on the morning of the 24th to drain the accumulated fluid, and then further treatment will be carried out. He will return to Lushan after he recovers. Fan formerly served as the commander of the 51st Division and other positions, and made contributions to the party and the country. He has a unique secret in medicine. Since resigning and practicing medicine, he has saved countless people and does not accept consultation fees. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the wife of President Chiang, also suffered from an illness once before, which was cured by Fan's treatment.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Were Slightly More Active Again Yesterday, Transporting Gunny Sacks and Barbed Wire to the Zhabei Beer Factory for Storage</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the situation of the Japanese Navy stationed in the North Sichuan Road and Zhabei areas of Shanghai was slightly more active again yesterday. Yesterday morning, military supplies such as gunny sacks and barbed wire, fully loaded in two large vehicles, were transported from the Japanese Naval Headquarters to the Japanese Beer Factory in Zhabei for storage. Patrol team military vehicles still crossed the boundary into the city area yesterday, coming and going from time to time, and the positions were also set up and withdrawn from time to time, making their actions unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Notices from Two Civic Organizations: Implementing a "One-Day Movement"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation and the Citizens' Promoting Domestic Goods Association believe that the proposal initiated by this city's newspaper to "Contribute to the Country for One Day" should be enthusiastically promoted. In addition to all staff voluntarily donating one day's salary, they also notified citizens in all districts to contribute generously. The original text reads: (1) The First Special District Citizens' Federation notified citizens in all districts: "Regarding the notification, Chairman Chiang has dedicated himself to the revolution and made great contributions to the party and the country. Now, on the occasion of his 50th birthday, people from all walks of life across the country have been donating funds to purchase aircraft to celebrate his birthday, showing the spirit of the people of the country supporting the leader and defending the country. This city's newspaper has now initiated a 'One-Day Contribution to the Country' campaign, requesting all stores in the city to moderately deduct a portion of their one-day's sales, and employees also donate one day's salary, to be used for purchasing aircraft to celebrate the birthday. The City Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed the whole country to follow suit. Our association expresses its deep sympathy for this. In addition to all staff voluntarily donating one day's salary for purchasing aircraft to celebrate the birthday, we also hope that all compatriots will rise up together and contribute generously, so that we can gather sand into a tower and collect fur into a robe, and jointly promote the great effect of saving the country. We look forward to it very much." (2) The Citizens' Promoting Domestic Goods Association also sent a letter to all members stating, "We, recognizing the difficult situation of the country in recent years, all wish to devote our minds and show our loyalty to serve the country. Therefore, we believe that the newspaper's initiative to 'Contribute to the Country for One Day' is far-sighted and unanimously express our agreement. The 28th meeting has decided to notify all members, please quickly rise up together, firmly carry out, hoping that all factories will automatically propose a part or all of one day's sales, and employees donate one day's salary, all of which will be used to purchase aircraft and wish the Chairman longevity. With one action, we can benefit the country and the people. Please submit the donations before the end of this month. We look forward to it very much." Also, after the association's solicitation ended, many parties continued to pay the solicitations. When the total announcement was made last time, the scores of teams including Mi Jifang, Wang Xiaolai, Gu Xinyi, Yang Weiyin, Zhu Gengtao, Shen Shuyu, Hu Yongji, Wang Rongkun, Ding Xizhi, Ye Youcai, Xu Xiangxun, Fu Zuoheng, and Zhu Ziqian were not included. They plan to summarize and publish them all together by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Celebrated Xu Chongzhi's Birthday Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xu Chongzhi, Vice President of the Control Yuan, celebrated his 50th birthday yesterday. Mr. Xu originally did not intend to make a grand affair of it, but due to the warm birthday celebrations held by various parties the night before, he found it difficult to decline their kind intentions. Therefore, at noon yesterday, he hosted a banquet at his private residence on Seymour Road to receive congratulations. Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of the city, Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Liu Zhenhuan, former Commander-in-Chief of the Guangxi Army, Liu Zhilu, former Commander of the Guangxi Army, and leaders from various circles such as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and Qian Xinzhi all offered their congratulations. The guests filled the house, making it a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>Yikangyu Electrical Materials Store - Warehouse Accident Yesterday</h3>
<p>The warehouse of Yikangyu Electrical Materials Store at No. 54 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, which is owned by Zheng Wenyi of Ningbo, employs an old clerk named Luo Quan. Yesterday afternoon around 3 o'clock, Luo Quan was smoking a cigarette and threw the cigarette butt into a pile of firewood, causing a sudden fire. The fire was very fierce at the time, with black smoke rising straight up. The firefighters from the French Concession Songshan Road Fire Brigade rushed to the scene with their fire engines to put out the fire. It took about an hour to extinguish the blaze. As a result, a three-story market house was burned down.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhuan Discusses His Thoughts on Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations - If Japan Destroys Peace, China is Prepared to Defend Itself and Sacrifice</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Liu Zhenhuan was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek from Guangdong to Shanghai. After Chairman Chiang returns to Nanjing from Shaanxi, he will go to Nanjing for an audience. Yesterday, Mr. Liu expressed his views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations to Western reporters as follows: The recent tension in Sino-Japanese relations has aroused the attention and alarm of countries around the world. Recalling the September 18th Incident, I wrote to my Japanese friend, Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi, urging the Japanese government to change its policy as soon as possible in order to maintain the friendship and diplomatic relations between the two countries for hundreds of years. Time flies, and five years have passed in the blink of an eye. In the past two months, Japan has once again used the Chengdu, Beihai, and Shanghai incidents as excuses to make deeper threats. My initial idea was that the international situation of the two major powers in East Asia is related to world peace. China has never given up the occupied four northeastern provinces, and it is by no means the result of a failed war. Unexpectedly, Japan misunderstood and mistakenly believed that the occupation of the four northeastern provinces was an indication that China was willing to give up. This is a great mistake. The rapid resolution of the recent Guangdong-Guangxi issue is enough to prove that the Chinese people are thoroughly aware that internal differences are far less tense than the mood of unanimous opposition to foreign countries. If Japan destroys peace, the Chinese government, under the unified situation, will lead 450 million people and prepare to sacrifice for self-defense. Japan may not be in an absolutely advantageous position. First of all, in terms of military affairs, China is fighting because it is oppressed, while Japan is fighting for aggression. The difference between righteousness and unrighteousness is obvious, which is already unfavorable. Moreover, China waits at ease for the enemy to exhaust itself, which is easier in strategy than Japan's laborious and long-distance expedition. In terms of economy, since China implemented the new currency policy, its financial foundation has become stable. Japan's national debt has exceeded 10 billion yuan, and this year's budget has reached a huge 3.6 billion yuan. Its financial groups are already unwilling to continually add to the huge military expenditure. Once something happens, it will inevitably be exhausted to cope with it. Moreover, Japan has always regarded China as its largest market, with annual trade with China exceeding 130 million yuan. The suspension of wartime trade is inevitable. This kind of loss will more easily affect its national economy. Under the circumstances of high tax barriers built by Britain and the United States, Japan's commercial protection law has sometimes completely failed. Where else can it be compensated? Moreover, during wartime, national industries will inevitably shift to military needs, and the unemployment problem will inevitably become more serious. In terms of diplomacy, Japan has become isolated since it withdrew from the League of Nations. Recently, the Anglo-Russian naval agreement has posed a major threat to Japan. The United States is making every effort to consolidate its defense zones in the Pacific and is accelerating the shipbuilding process. Japan's desire to compete with the United States for naval power is by no means permitted by its economic environment. As a result, it will have to deal with the Pacific defense with a situation of one against three, which may not be within its power. Therefore, from all aspects, Japan does not have full confidence in the war. Thinking for Japan, it should still regard Sino-Japanese co-existence and co-prosperity as the fundamental national policy. If it still insists on a tough stance and threatens in every possible way, it is tantamount to plunging China and Japan into a desperate situation of common destruction, which will only increase the tragedy in the history of the yellow race. People in the neighboring country with foresight should not do this. Diplomacy has now reached the final stage, and whether it is a disaster or a blessing depends entirely on the Japanese themselves.</p>
<p>Another piece of information is that Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, went to the Cangzhou Hotel around 11 o'clock yesterday morning to visit Mr. Liu and had a pleasant conversation.</p>

<h3>The Women and Children's Education and Nursing Home Held Its 15th Anniversary Celebration Yesterday - Actively Preparing to Build a Nursery and a Nursing Home - The United Child Welfare Association Liberates婢女(Female Servants)</h3>
<p>The Women and Children's Education and Nursing Home, affiliated with the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, held its 15th anniversary celebration at the Jiangwan branch at 3:00 pm yesterday. More than 200 guests from all walks of life attended. Mrs. Mao Kelun presided over the meeting, and Chen Tiesheng gave a speech. The association also decided to establish a nursing home and a free nursery. After the meeting, there were recreational activities and refreshments. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Reports on the History of the Nursing Home</p>
<p>After the meeting began, the chairman first reported on the history of the establishment over the past 15 years, stating: This nursing home has been established for 15 years. When it was first opened, the startup cost was only 400 yuan. The address of the nursing home was initially located in Ximen, and the houses were also rented. Later, thanks to the generous donations from Mr. Yang Jingshiguang and others, land was purchased in 民國(Minguo) 17 (1928). The construction of Yunfang Hall, the current address of the nursing home, began, and a dormitory for mothers was added. The school gradually took shape. After the "January 28th Incident," a part of the building was destroyed. After the war, efforts were made to revive it, and it has now been restored to its former appearance. We hope that people from all walks of life will help us together.</p>
<p>Chen's Speech on Liberating婢女(Female Servants)</p>
<p>Then, Chen Tiesheng, the Director-General of the Child Welfare Association, gave a speech, stating: The Chinese Women's Temperance Association and the Women and Children's Education and Nursing Home have achieved remarkable results in the past 15 years. Now, the nursing home is also closely linked with the Child Welfare Association to carry out the work of liberating婢女(Female Servants) in order to assist the government in promoting the liberation of婢女(Female Servants). At present, the Chinese Child Welfare Association has decided to establish a婢女(Female Servants) Education and Nursing Home to accommodate婢女(Female Servants) of younger age. Older婢女(Female Servants) will be accommodated by the nursing home and given education and care. This will soon become a reality.</p>
<p>筹创(筹創)托儿所(托兒所)怡老园(怡老園) - Preparing to Establish a Nursery and a Nursing Home</p>
<p>Then, Liu Wang Liming reported on the expansion plan of the nursing home, stating: "The past history of this nursing home has been reported by Mrs. Mao in great detail. I am now reporting on the development plan, and I hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance. (1) Establish a free nursery so that poor working women can entrust their babies to us without paying any fees. (2) Establish a nursing home to accommodate poor elderly people. The two projects require approximately 20,000 yuan in funding. The funding for the nursing home has already been donated by a certain Westerner, and the address has also been selected at Yeyuan in Jiangwan, and it is actively underway. The funding for the nursery is still hoped to be donated by people from all walks of life." After Mrs. Liu's report, the Qingqing Chorus (students from the attached elementary school of Shanghai University and the nursing home) performed until 5:00 pm, when refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Exchange of Legal Tender Crowded - Scoundrels Seize the Opportunity to Deceive - Ge Zhenfang Brings 角币(Jiaobi, small change) Every Morning - Cheating in Short Amounts to Those Exchanging</h3>
<p>Since the circulation of legal tender, the exchange affairs of the Central Bank have become busy. Every day from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, people come to exchange legal tender for 角票(Jiaopiao, small denomination banknotes) or to exchange 角票(Jiaopiao) for legal tender. Among these people, employees of cigarette and paper shops are the most numerous. There is a man named Ge Zhenfang from Hangzhou, who works at the Xiangfeng cigarette and paper shop at No. 94 Yan Hai Lane in Nanshi. Because he felt that this kind of exchange method could be used as an opportunity to deceive, he would bring hundreds of yuan of 角票(Jiaopiao) to the Central Bank every morning. When he saw someone exchanging legal tender for 角票(Jiaopiao), he would say to that person, "I am exchanging 角票(Jiaopiao) for legal tender. Since you want to exchange legal tender for 角票(Jiaopiao), you can exchange what you have for what I have, which is convenient for both of us. Isn't it better than waiting for a long time?" People who want to exchange 角票(Jiaopiao) all hope to complete the transaction quickly and do not want to wait for a long time, so they mostly followed Ge's words and exchanged with him. Ge would look at the amount needed by the other party, such as 50 yuan or 100 yuan, and then take out the 角票(Jiaopiao) from his bag and give it to them. The tickets were neatly stacked, with each stack being 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 20 yuan, etc. When Ge received the legal tender, he would leave without waiting for the other party to finish counting the money. Therefore, even if the exchanger later found that the amount of 角票(Jiaopiao) was less than the amount exchanged, there was no way to find Ge's whereabouts. The money was lost, and they could only sigh in vain. Ge, on the other hand, only had to lift a hand and make a profit several times higher than any other business. Therefore, he made this his regular business and was never seen through. At 10 o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, Ge went to the exchange office of the Central Bank again. At that time, the people exchanging tickets were very crowded. There was a person who looked like a shop clerk who wanted to exchange 100 yuan of 角票(Jiaopiao). Ge used his old trick and accepted the 100 yuan of legal tender and gave him nine stacks of 角票(Jiaopiao), saying that one stack was 20 yuan. The shop clerk immediately checked and found that the total amount was only 65 yuan, 35 yuan less. At that time, Ge had not gone far and was caught up.</p>
<p>Ge was reprimanded loudly. Knowing that he was at fault, he did not dare to argue, admitted that the count was not clear, and made up the missing amount. He privately rejoiced that he had made up for the deficiency and that the secret would not be revealed. Who knew that among the crowd of ticket exchangers gathered there, there happened to be someone who had been deceived before? One was Qiu Jinsheng, a shop clerk from Mitsui 洋行(Trading Company), who went to the Central Bank on the 21st of this month to exchange 50 yuan of 角票(Jiaopiao). He met Ge there and exchanged with him. When he counted the money, he was 15 yuan short, and Ge had disappeared. Qiu had to</p>
<p>admit his bad luck. One was Shao Botang Shi Liangpu, employees of the Qianruihe Qianchanghe cigarette and paper shops on Xinyongan Street, who also went to the Central Bank on the 19th of this month to exchange 50 yuan of 角票(Jiaopiao). They also met Ge and exchanged with him, and they were 10 yuan short. Therefore, Qiu, Shao, and Shi surrounded Ge. However, at this time, the shop clerk had already made up for the missing amount and went home alone. Then, the gatekeeper of No. 84 of the bank, saw this situation, asked what had happened, and then took Ge to the General Patrol House. Detective Jiang Shangpei searched Ge and found 24 yuan of legal tender and 395 yuan of 角票(Jiaopiao). Together, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Ye Shengchao interrogated them. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the patrol house, stated the situation of the defendant's deception and requested that he be punished in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law. However, he was still afraid that there were more than just three or four people who had been deceived, so he asked the court to postpone the case and allow the patrol house to conduct a more detailed investigation. The court then questioned Ge Zhenfang about the situation of the deception, ordered the defendant to be detained, and postponed the next hearing to the fourth.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Steamer - Miscellaneous Notes on Accidents - Huashun Damaged</h3>
<p>The Huashun Steamer of the Huasheng Steamship Company of this port was going to Wuhu to load grain and goods to be transported to Guangdong. It was once stranded at Yuxi Port on the opposite side of Wuhu. It was rescued to Wuhu to load all the goods and anchored in front of the Wuhu Customs to wait for customs clearance. Unexpectedly, the Zhenchang Steamer of the Yangzi Company came and suddenly collided with the left side of the Huashun Steamer, causing the iron plates to be bent and dented a lot. The hull was badly damaged, but there were goods inside the cabin, which had to be unloaded before inspection. Fortunately, the damaged part was still above the waterline, which did not hinder navigation.</p>
<p>Civilian Ship Drifting</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Office received a telegram from the captain of the Huashan Maru Steamer of the Nissin Company, stating that the ship discovered a civilian ship on the sea surface at 122 degrees 17 minutes east longitude and 33 degrees 18 minutes north latitude on the 23rd. There was no one in the ship. When the accident happened and how it happened were unknown. It is said that the Port Affairs Office has notified the various shipping companies.</p>
<p>Shunyuan Damaged</p>
<p>The owner of the Yuanshun Steamer of the Yongyuan Steamship Company telegraphed from Shanghai yesterday, stating that the ship had left Tianjin with all the goods loaded. When it arrived at Dagu, it encountered a Japanese steamer entering the port. The Yuanshun Steamer was hit hard by the Japanese steamer and was severely damaged. It can no longer navigate and has decided to go to Dalian for repairs. The telegram was too simple, and the company has telegraphed to inquire about the details.</p>
<h3>Customs Tender for Sugar Goods</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued a notice to merchants to bid for sugar goods: This Customs now has 12 bags of sugar cubes, weighing 565 kilograms, 130 bags of crystal sugar, weighing 28,485 kilograms, 80 bags of fine white sugar, weighing 2,070 kilograms, and 1,626 bags of white sugar, weighing 50,000 kilograms. They are currently stored in the Customs Pudong Warehouse and are being tendered for sale. The weight of these items are all approximate figures and can be accurately weighed during delivery. During the tender period, from 9:00 am to 4:30 pm every day, merchants can apply to the Transportation Department of this Customs to inspect the goods and extract samples. The letter can specify the purchase of all or only part of the goods. It must be submitted to the Taxation Department of the General Affairs Section of this Customs before 10:00 am on Wednesday, October 28th of this year. This Customs reserves the right not to accept the highest bid or any tender. The successful bidder shall submit 25% of the bid price to the Customs on the same day and pay for the goods and take delivery within one week. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Public Concession - Health Conditions Last Month - Vaccination Work Actively Carried Out - Increase in Malaria is Alarming</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's health report for September, the mortality rate of Chinese and foreign residents in the Concession this month, although above the normal level, has no special symptoms in terms of diseases. Regarding infectious diseases, the occasional outbreak of smallpox is extremely worrying. Now that the free vaccination provided by the Health Department is very convenient, residents in the Concession who have not been vaccinated or have been vaccinated for a long time should go for vaccination as soon as possible, especially those who have recently come to Shanghai from other places. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable. Furthermore, malaria in this port is now becoming more and more rampant, which is an alarming phenomenon. According to the report in June of this year, the number of people with malaria in the Concession was only 32. In July, it increased to 96. In August, it increased to 157. And the number of reported malaria cases in September reached 206. The source of this disease is nothing more than infection through travel to malaria-prone areas. Furthermore, the cholera prevention work this year ended at the end of this month, and the staff have also been transferred to vaccination work. According to statistics, a total of 124,043 people were vaccinated this year, and 31,933 people received the second injection. It is fortunate that cholera has not occurred this year. In addition, notable diseases include 120 cases of dysentery and 17 cases of typhoid fever. Regarding rabies, two people died in September, a British child of 16 years old and a Chinese man. Both died without timely treatment. Furthermore, there are many blood flukes in the ponds and banks in the suburbs of Shanghai. The Health Department has repeatedly issued warnings before, but unfortunately, residents and Boy Scouts who camp in the suburbs do not pay attention to this, resulting in many people being infected with blood fluke disease after returning. They should be treated quickly, otherwise it will be too late.</p>
<p>###诱惑(誘惑)妇人(婦人)诈骗(詐騙)巨金(鉅金) - Ye Fook Hon Accused - Wang Hon Hing States Ye's Methods too Vicious - Lists Facts to Accuse Department of Justice - Court Summons Lawyer Fan Gong to Testify</p>
<p>Ye Fook Hon, who served as a candidate judge in the criminal court of the Shanghai Local Court in 1927, is a native of Wujiang, Jiangsu Province. Later, because he was hearing a case in which the Taicang County Party Department reported local tyrants and evil gentry Yao Heling, Ye mistakenly cited the law and did not handle it in accordance with the law on punishing local tyrants and evil gentry, and detained the reporter Cao Runtang, a party committee member, for false accusation. Therefore, he was disciplined by the Central Party Department. As a result, the former President Yang Zhaoyun was given a major demerit, and Ye was dismissed. In May 1928, he joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association to practice as a lawyer. His residence number is 1311 Yiwangjiazhai, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. He has the most law offices and branch offices. In recent years, he has also created four Little Luzon hat shops, becoming a famous lawyer and a famous new business merchant in Shanghai. Recently, Wang Hon Hing accused Ye Fook Hon in the Department of Judicial Administration of defrauding him of his huge family wealth and seducing his wife. According to Wang Hon Hing, when Wang was implicated in a theft case in 1931, he had already hired lawyer Fan Gong to defend him and had paid a public fee of 1,500 yuan. However, this was known to his lawyer's broker, who brought Wang's wife to lawyer Ye's office and said that 10,000 yuan could guarantee that he would be declared innocent. At that time, he was trapped in error. Ye formally wrote to lawyer Fan Gong's office and transferred all the documents to Ye for handling. As a result, Wang Hon Hing was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. In the middle, due to appeals, he was detained for two or three years. However, Ye defrauded money by taking advantage of his position and coveted Wang's wealth. Wang's wife was young and could be deceived, so she was seduced and became an adulteress, cohabiting for a long time. As a result, the huge wealth of tens of thousands of dollars was all transferred away, so his property was used for his Little Luzon hat shop career. But when Wang's prison term was about to expire, Ye ordered Wang's wife to separate from Wang. When Wang's wife asked for huge sums of money, Ye said that it had been used up during the cohabitation and would not return it. However, at the beginning of Wang's imprisonment, 15 gold bars were found in his house during a search. It was found that they were not stolen goods and were returned to Wang. However, Ye colluded with many people to threaten him, demanding that they share the gold bars, otherwise they would find someone to report to the authorities that they were stolen in another case. Wang was threatened and listened to their arrangements to swallow seven or eight tenths of the gold bars. Therefore, because the methods were too vicious, he filed a complaint with the Department of Judicial Administration and would have his wife file a separate complaint. It is now found that this case was previously investigated by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate under the direction of the Department of Judicial Administration. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu ordered Ye Mao Kang to pay 20,000 yuan in bail and released him on the spot. In the past few days, according to Wang Hon Hing's lawsuit, someone had mediated. The court had summoned lawyer Fan Gong, lawyer Gu Ao, lawyer Zha Renwei, and lawyer Shen to testify.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Company - Minutes of Yesterday's Shareholders Meeting</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company held its 16th annual shareholders meeting at its headquarters on East Seward Road yesterday. Shareholders holding a total of 493,470 shares attended the meeting. The meeting began at 2:00 pm as scheduled. Chairman Chen Bingqian presided over the meeting and reported on the company's operating situation for the year. Then, Supervisor Lao Zesheng read the 16th annual financial report. There were no objections. Then, the Chairman proposed a vote to elect directors and supervisors. Shareholders Wang Wendian and others publicly elected Zhuang Zikuan and Wang Junzhi as tellers. Wang Junzhi publicly elected Zhou Qingquan and Wang Wendian as supervisors to open the ballots. As a result of the ballot opening, the most elected directors were: Jian Kongzhao, Pan Xingnong, Jian Yujie, Jian Minxuan, Zhou Shouchang, Du Yuesheng, Song Ziliang, Lao Jingxiu, Feng Bingnan, Chen Bingqian, Lu Yunqiu, Jian Yingfu, Jian Chengwan, Jian Zhichuan, and Pan Yucun. The most elected supervisors were Lao Zesheng and Chen Jizhi. The next most elected alternate supervisors were Liang Ziyu and Li Zhongguang. The results were announced on the spot, and the meeting was adjourned with the ringing of a bell.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Hall - Construction Project Completed - Lu Genquan Talks About the Construction Process</h3>
<p>Lu Genquan, the owner of the Lu Genji Construction Company, which contracted to build the National Assembly Hall, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and told reporters from the Architecture News Agency that he (Lu referred to himself) had won the bid at the end of November last year to contract the construction of the National Art Exhibition Hall and the National Academy of Drama and Music, with a construction cost of 378,000 yuan. Later, because the Art Exhibition Hall added a floor and the Academy of Music added cold and hot gas pipe trenches, sub-road excavation, and Yinming trenches, another 300,000 yuan was added, so the total construction cost was 678,000 yuan. Other projects added from time to time are not included. On November 29th of the same year, the preparatory committee Chuminyi, Zhang Daofan, Chen Shuren, Chen Lifu, and others presided over the groundbreaking ceremony. Dean Ju presided over the ceremony. Drama artists who participated in the ceremony on that day included Tian Han, Hong Shen, Ouyang Yuqian, Tang Huaiqiu, Ying Yunwei, and more than 30 others. After the groundbreaking, the work was completely suspended from February to the end of April due to repeated changes in the drawings and other reasons. Then, Chuminyi, the director of the preparatory committee, received a thunderous order from Chairman Jiang, approving the renaming of the National Academy of Drama and Music to the National Assembly Hall, to be used as the venue for this National Assembly. In mid-April of this year, the Preparatory Committee renamed architect Fan Wenzhao as consulting architect, and Commissioner Chu personally inspected the site three to five times a day. The construction became increasingly tense, and he also stayed in the factory to facilitate command and easy response. During the construction period, National Government Chairman Lin, Dean Ju, Dean Sun, Minister Kong, and Wu Zhi Lao all visited the site and gave instructions. On August 10th, the Preparatory Committee received a letter stating that the date of the General Assembly had been decided and that it was of great importance to the whole country. There could be no delay, so the construction project must be completed on schedule. It was necessary to plan comprehensively, take effective measures, speed up construction, and complete the project on schedule to avoid delaying the opening date. It was a major national ceremony and should not be violated, causing inconvenience. Chen Shuren of the Preparatory Committee repeatedly limited the completion date to the end of October. Therefore, electric lights were installed throughout the factory, and more than a thousand workers worked day and night. He forgot to sleep and eat for more than ten days. During this period, he flew to Shanghai for medical treatment for about a week due to illness. The efforts of Mr. Chen, the general supervisor of the factory, during this period should not be ignored. For the sake of safety, the Preparatory Committee temporarily hired 1,500 workers on the 16th to conduct a pressure test on the stands, which was presided over by architect Fan Wenzhao, who came to Beijing. The results were good. Chairman Lin also came to the site for inspection. At present, the internal painting project has been completed one after another and is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of this month and handed over to the Preparatory Committee for acceptance and management. The Art Exhibition Hall and the National Assembly Hall are both three-dimensional buildings, towering on the side of the National Government Road, which is extremely spectacular. There is a modern stage in the Assembly Hall, which can seat 1,800 people upstairs and 1,000 people in the stalls. The three floors can seat 600 people. The front stage is four stories high, and the back stage is eight stories high, which can fully accommodate all great scenery and props. In short, he spent a lot of money on materials for the construction of the National Assembly Hall this time due to the limited completion date, and suffered great losses in construction. All sacrifices were made at all costs. Although the General Assembly was announced to be postponed, the construction of the Assembly Hall was finally completed on schedule, so he felt much comforted in spirit. It is said that Mr. Lu will stay in Shanghai for a few days and will go to Beijing to start the procedures for the transfer of the new building to the committee.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau - Bans Unlicensed Female Doctors</h3>
<p>The baby daughter of Zhou Xiangfan, a resident of No. 7 Zhangjia Muqiao, Pengpu District, Zhabei, was only a month old. She hired Yang Zhang, a neighbor, to treat her oral disease. Yang Zhang claimed that it was "螳螂子(Tanglangzi, Mantis offspring)", and used a knife to perform surgery in her mouth, causing blood to flow like a flood. She died soon after. Zhou Xiangfan immediately took Yang Zhang to the Xinza Public Security Bureau and filed a complaint with the Health Bureau, requesting that she be investigated and punished according to law. After receiving the report, the bureau sent staff to investigate and found that the facts were true. It was also found that Yang Zhang was an ignorant woman who dared to practice medicine without a license and harm people's lives. This was extremely illegal. It sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to send her to the court for strict handling. It is said that the bureau has recently sent staff to conduct on-site investigations and strictly ban unlicensed quacks in the city to maintain the health of citizens.</p>

<p>Venue Anecdotes:</p>
<p>Over the three days of the tournament, the schools and organizations visiting the venue, apart from a small number of participating schools, the remaining voluntary attendees were only from five schools: the Youth Association Middle School, the Sino-French National Institute of Technology, Danhua Middle School, Donghai Commercial Vocational Middle School, and the Steel Factory Workers' Children's School. Although the Social Bureau stipulated that schools could take a day off to attend and observe, the number was so small. Is it that the schools are unwilling to take a day off and neglect their studies, or are they using the day off for other activities? It is unknown.</p>
<p>The excessive number of groups in this Municipal Games has been felt by everyone to be cumbersome. However, some people also feel it is good; otherwise, some schools would not be able to win championships. A laugh.</p>
<p>Miss Ma Li, who won two first places in the open group, is petite, exquisite, lively, and lovely. According to Miss Ma, she is still studying at the Municipal Tangwan Elementary School. It is admirable that an elementary school student boldly participates in the Municipal Games.</p>
<p>This Municipal Games has a particularly large number of groups. Zhang Yuansheng presides over the track and field starts, enforcing the rules strictly. He has been unusually busy for the past three days.</p>

<p>Children's Supplement of Shen Bao, Boy Scouts</p>
<p>Meaning</p>
<p>Little brothers and sisters, when you reach the fifth or sixth grade in school, you will become Boy Scouts. I feel very happy about this.</p>
<p>Why am I happy to see you become Boy Scouts? It is because I think you look mighty and brave in your Boy Scout uniforms, which can represent a new spirit of China!</p>
<p>Recalling when I was your age, I didn't enjoy such happiness. There were no Boy Scouts then. We didn't wear such solemn uniforms like you do, and we couldn't show the spirit of vigor and bravery.</p>
<p>Boy Scout training is to make you lively, brave, and loving, to practice the skills and knowledge necessary for life, to teach you how to cook and camp, to teach you to "do a good deed every day," and to teach you to "act bravely for righteousness." Before the widespread organization of Boy Scouts, this kind of training could only be learned from textbooks, but it is indeed a very meaningful training. It is really a good phenomenon that it can be widely implemented now.</p>
<p>Little brothers and sisters, I hope that after you become Boy Scouts, you will get many benefits and be able to help yourselves, help others, and help the country!</p>
<p>Random Chats on Children's Stories By Yi Sheng</p>
<p>Wei Jie Asks About Dreams</p>
<p>Wei Jie was a famous handsome man. When he walked on the road, many women would rush to look at his face, so there was an idiom at the time, "Watching Wei Jie to Death." He was not only beautiful but also talented and had been studying hard since he was a child. When his hair could just be tied up, he was extremely suspicious of the reasoning behind dreams and was unwilling to let it go so casually like ordinary children, so he asked Mr. Le Guang. Mr. Le explained, "Dreams are formed by thoughts." Wei Jie asked again, "Things that the spirit and body have never come into contact with also enter dreams. Does that also come from thoughts?" Mr. Le said, "That always has a cause. No one has ever dreamed of riding in a car but going into a rat's hole, or grinding vegetables but chewing a pestle, because there is no such thought or cause." Wei Jie respectfully took his leave and went home, pondering all day long, "What is called cause?" His small brain overworked, and he became sick from excessive thinking. Mr. Le learned of the situation and quickly went to his house by carriage, explaining and analyzing it to him in great detail. His illness subsided quickly. Mr. Le couldn't help but praise, "This child's heart should not develop diseases of stagnation—where something remains and obstructs the middle, causing illness!"</p>
<p>Confucius taught us, "If in doubt, ask." This is really the initial step in learning and cannot be neglected in the slightest! But unfortunately, there are not many children who are willing to ask now, and even after asking, they still may not fully understand. Very few are willing to repeatedly ask their teachers for instruction! This situation is caused by three reasons: one is the habit of laziness, not seeking thorough understanding in everything, and not asking at all; another is pretending to be smart, fearing that asking again will make their peers look down on their natural talent; and the third is retreating in the face of difficulty, fearing that continuing to ask may not lead to sudden enlightenment but will instead annoy the teachers and be reflected in their expressions. If any of these three apply, children will not be able to "know when they know, and admit when they do not know." This relies on the enlightenment and skillful guidance of teachers and elders, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Xi'er's Awakening By Fang Zheng</p>
<p>Zhong'er and Xi'er are two brothers who study at ×× School. They not only have a spirit of mutual respect and love but also have unity! Occasionally, when someone bullies them, they immediately unite to give the bully a good beating! So, we can truly praise them with a saying: "Brotherly love"!</p>
<p>However, since Jing'er, nicknamed Short Winter Melon, came to their second grade class last year, their relationship has gradually faded. Because Short Winter Melon, although young, is really a bad kid. He can say to Zhong'er, "Xi'er is scolding you!" But at the same time, he can say to Xi'er, "Zhong'er is saying bad things about you!" After his instigation, the most loving brothers have to turn into strangers and enemies, and they even quarrel with each other relentlessly. But Short Winter Melon watches it as a play, secretly laughing. Sometimes, he even brags among his classmates about how strong his instigating skills are!</p>
<p>One day, he instigated Xi'er to steal Zhong'er's fountain pen to lend to him. But Xi'er, being ignorant, finally fell for his trick. The next day in class, Zhong'er discovered that his fountain pen was gone and searched everywhere but couldn't find it. So, he told the teacher, who, after investigating, found it in Short Winter Melon's bag. Everyone thought that this bad egg must have stolen it, so they insisted that the teacher expel him. But unexpectedly, Short Winter Melon calmly told the teacher the reason why Xi'er lent it to him and how Xi'er stole it. He also returned the fountain pen to Xi'er in front of everyone. In this way, Short Winter Melon was not only not expelled but Xi'er was also lectured by the teacher.</p>
<p>When Xi'er returned home, he pondered how to face his brother and parents. "I should wake up and realize that I fell for someone else's trick." So, he immediately apologized to his brother. On the other hand, he made an oath with Zhong'er: "Never associate with Short Winter Melon, restore our inherent unity, and defeat our enemies. We must know that brotherly discord is enough to destroy everything!"</p>

<p>The Story of the Horse By Ouyang Hui</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, in the shaded avenues of the forest, a group of free horses were all sighing and saying, "Why are we always bullied by those horned devils—the deer? Can't we really resist them??" But they ultimately had no strength to resist the deer because, upon seeing them, their hearts would thump, all resistance would be lost, and they would flee with their tails drooping. One day, the horses were strolling outside the forest when they encountered two hunters. They had a desire for revenge and, in a very pitiful manner, told the hunters and begged them to avenge them. The hunters readily agreed. So, they knelt down and allowed the hunters to ride on their backs, leading them to the enemies' location. The hunters then drove away and stabbed the deer to death. The two horses, seeing that their great revenge had been taken, thought they could finally relax and happily wanted to bid farewell to the hunters and return. But the hunters said with cold smiles, "Huh! It's not that easy! We still need you!" They took two thick ropes and, without any politeness, led the two horses into this harsh world.</p>

<p>The Biggest Flower and the Smallest Bird By Mingxin</p>
<p>Little friends, aren't the flowers we usually see only as big as our palms? But in the Philippines, there is a peculiar plant that has what can be considered the largest flower in the world. When it is in full bloom, it is more than three feet in diameter—about the size of a small peach tree. Can't that be considered the largest flower?</p>
<p>Little friends probably already know that the pollen from the stamens of a plant's flower must be transferred to the pistil for fruit to form. Pollen transferred by water is called water-pollination; pollen transferred by wind is called wind-pollination; pollen transferred by insects such as bees, butterflies, and moths is called insect-pollination; and some plants are pollinated by bats or snails. But in tropical America, there is a small bird that can also pollinate, called bird-pollination. This bird is light and small, only a little over ten centimeters in size, about the size of half a newspaper, and weighs about the same as a bee, so people call it a hummingbird. The hummingbird can be considered the smallest bird in the world. The hummingbird's beak is very slender, making it easy to suck nectar. Its colors are very beautiful, with bright emerald green feathers on its back and red and shiny down on its throat, chest, and abdomen. Its voice is very clear. It lives in dense small leaves, and its nest is built very skillfully. It often flies back and forth in the flowers like bees and butterflies, using its slender beak to reach into the flowers and suck the sweetness. Sometimes it also catches small harmful insects to eat. When it stretches its beak into the flower to suck nectar, it unintentionally scatters the pollen on the feathers of its long beak and transfers it to other flowers.</p>

<p>Two Classmates Who Loved Eating Snacks By Cao Meiying, Fourth Grade Girl, Wan Zhu Elementary School</p>
<p>Among my classmates, there is a girl named Yin. Her family is also very wealthy, so her pockets are often full of money. However, in school, she doesn't study very hard, but she is very particular about snacks. Every day after arriving at school, she only likes to buy snacks to eat. One day in the morning, I saw her buy two pieces of bread and some beef. Before long, she had eaten them all up. After two classes, the things she had eaten started to act up, and she suddenly had a stomachache. She asked the teacher for leave to go home. Unexpectedly, she was sick for more than a month, abandoning her studies, and she was afraid that she would not be able to advance to the next grade this semester.</p>
<p>Among the classmates, there is a boy named Zhang, about thirteen or fourteen years old, who studies very hard. His family is wealthier than mine, so his pockets are also often full of money. I really don't understand why he often has a toothache. Later, after I inquired from other classmates, I learned that he only likes to buy snacks to eat. Among the snacks, he especially likes eating preserves, such as Gong Sheng Sugar, eggplant coffee sugar, and other fragrant and dry things. Last Monday, he took leave due to toothache and has been out for more than a week. His grades for the next semester will inevitably be affected.</p>
<p>Now I am writing about my classmates and submitting this as a contribution without any malice. If classmates Yin and Zhang didn't like eating snacks, they probably wouldn't have so many illnesses, and they wouldn't waste money. I hope that all the children in the country will not buy too many snacks to eat.</p>

<p>Scientific Little Question</p>
<p>Why is the Water in a Thermos Not Easily Cooled? By Zixi</p>
<p>Anyone who has used a thermos knows that it is not easy to cool down the hot water stored inside. Before I explain the reason, let me talk about a few things related to heat: heat is a form of energy, and it will never be destroyed in the universe. However, it always flows from substances with higher temperatures to substances with lower temperatures. Here, there are four ways of dissipating heat: radiation, convection, evaporation, and conduction. After we understand these causes of heat loss, let's examine the structure of a thermos: a thermos can be divided into two parts: one is the glass flask, and the other is the metal casing. The flask is made of a double-walled glass bottle, and there is a gap in between. The opposing glass walls in the gap are coated with a layer of silver. When the flask is first made, a solution containing silver is poured into the gap. When the silver is deposited on the two glass surfaces, the remaining solution is poured out, and then a vacuum pump is used to completely extract the air from the gap, making it a complete vacuum. Finally, the air extraction port is sealed. As for the outer casing, it is originally for protecting the flask and making it easier to carry. The reason why the water in a thermos is not easily cooled is that a vacuum can prevent heat conduction; radiant heat is reflected back by the silver layer on the glass walls; and the wooden stopper at the mouth prevents convection and evaporation. With these reasons, it is naturally easy to understand why the hot water in a thermos does not cool down easily.</p>

<p>Famous Things in the World (1) By Hai</p>
<p>In the early eighteenth century, there was a colonel in the Russian army who, for some reason, offended the brutal and unreasonable Emperor Paul I and was exiled to Siberia. The Russian government was extremely autocratic. If someone was considered harmful to the country, they were often sent to the cold and remote Siberia to live a miserable life in the ice and snow. Ordinary criminals were shackled with iron chains and sent to do hard labor in the mines there. However, political prisoners were allowed to go with their families, and the government provided living expenses every week. If that was not enough, they had to find work themselves, such as hunting or farming, to earn extra wages. However, their movements were not free, and they were constantly monitored, like birds in a cage.</p>
<p>Colonel Laublov was sentenced to life exile. After arriving in Siberia, he was ordered to live in the village of Izh, far north of the Siberian city of Tobolsk, and received only ten kopecks a day for living expenses. His wife and a three-year-old daughter, Boskofi, followed him. His wife patiently accepted the circumstances. All the housework that had previously been done by servants now had to be done by her own hands, without complaining about the hard work. Little Boskofi gradually grew up, not only helping her mother but also finding work in the village, gathering late wheat for farmers, receiving a small bundle of wheat as her wage. Although she lived in this desolate home, surrounded by severe frost and snow all year round, secretly without seeing the light of day, she was unknowingly happy every day until she was almost fifteen years old, when she began to understand that her father was suffering terribly in exile. The colonel had submitted a petition to the Governor of Siberia requesting amnesty to return home. The petition was sent by an official who promised to speak for him, so every time a messenger came from Tobolsk, he was particularly excited and restless. However, he waited day after day, only to be disappointed day after day. Therefore, in front of his daughter, he could no longer show a happy face. He always resented his bad fate, with no chance of turning things around, and watching his beloved daughter grow up without education, constantly working with her hands, working like a slave.</p>
<p>The colonel's disappointment and resentment suddenly shattered little Boskofi's childhood happiness. She prayed every day that her father would safely return home, escaping this painful exile. One day, after finishing her prayer, a new aspiration suddenly flashed in her little heart like lightning. She wanted to go to Petersburg herself to request an amnesty for her father. From then on, she often went alone to the pine forest to dream of fulfilling this aspiration. She also prayed to God to give her courage and perseverance to do this great work, which was to exonerate her father and send him home. But although she had this plan in her heart, she never dared to speak it out. Several times she wanted to ask her father to allow her to go to Petersburg, but the words were already on her lips, but she shrank back. After struggling for a while, she felt that she had to speak.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement, Amateur Weekly, Collective Creation and Collective Criticism of Sunday Literary Society By Wen Huai</p>
<p>Literary works are not only fundamentally products of the collective life of humanity; but also from the point of view of artistic completion, they were not originally created by individual writers. It can be said that the emergence of literary writers with an independent stance in the world, and the fact that literary works became the private property of individual writers, occurred after the emergence of private society; to be more precise, after the emergence of modern individualistic society. In ancient times, people lived a collective life, and there were no specialized writers at all. The poems, dramas, myths, and stories of that time were all produced by people in collective labor. Primitive songs, dramas, dances, etc., are all collectively created art. Even in the era of the emergence of private society, such as in the era of slave society and feudal society, because the division of labor in human society was not yet very detailed, writers who independently made a living by creating literary works could not universally exist. Therefore, many great literary works at that time were still collective creations. For example, our "Book of Songs," although it was "edited" by Confucius, its authors were not writers but the general public, people from all walks of life. Another example is the oldest Western poems: "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey." Although many literary historians say that they were written by Homer, in 1895, the German scholar Wolf put forward the opinion that "the poems were not written by one writer, they are the result of collective creation, composed of individual poems about the events of the Trojan War passed down orally, and were only finalized and written down in the sixth century BC by order of the Athenian tyrant Pisistratus (see Professor Cogan's "Outline of World Literary History")." Although this statement may not be reliable, judging from the era in which the two great poems appeared and the point that their styles are not completely consistent, there is no doubt that they were not created solely by the old blind man Homer. As for modern times, due to the development of industry, the increasingly detailed division of labor among human beings, the development of individualism, and the commodification of thought and skills along with material things, there are now writers who specialize in creating literary works as a lifelong career, and all literary works have naturally become the private property of individual writers. Poems as long as "Faust," and novels as long as the twenty-volume "Rougon-Macquart" series are all created by one writer. At this time, what the literary world advocates are "respect for individuality," "originality of genius," "unique style," unique insights, etc. Collective creation and collective criticism have become ridiculed phrases.</p>
<p>However, with the collapse of modern society, individualism is now declining, and the spirit of expressing collective life and engaging in collective creation has been valued by another group of new writers. Of course, the collective creation mentioned here does not necessarily refer to works completed jointly by many writers; we believe that it naturally counts as collective creation when many writers jointly collect materials, jointly discuss the themes and expressions of works, and even divide labor and cooperate to write together; but works produced under collective will and action should also be said to be collective products. For example, a group of writers organizes under common understanding, regularly discusses the creative attitude that should be adopted at the moment, what kind of social life should be the main subject matter, and even studies how it should be expressed, providing each other with opinions and materials, and unanimously striving towards a common direction to produce works, which can be said to be collective creation. The creative life of each writer in our progressive literary groups should be a collective creative life; and this kind of creative life is what every progressive writer should value.</p>
<p>We can imagine that when the issue of such collective creation is raised, two questions will inevitably arise: first, will such collective creation hinder the writer's creative freedom? Second, will the works produced by such collective creation become "stereotyped"? Now, in order to make the problem clearer, let's answer these two questions separately.</p>
<p>First is the issue of creative freedom. We believe that this issue is to be determined by whether the writer's subjective understanding and life experience are consistent with the collective creation he participates in. If the two are contradictory, then it will really hinder his creative freedom and really bind the development of his artistic talent; on the contrary, if the two are consistent, then the writer's participation in collective creation is "exactly what he wants," which will not only not hinder his creative freedom but also allow him to engage in creation more freely and develop his creative talents more freely. For example, at present, we put forward the slogan of "national defense literature," unite writers with national consciousness across the country to launch a salvation movement in the literary world, and hope that writers can participate in group creation under this slogan, so that literature, as a weapon, can play a great role in the salvation movement. In this situation, a writer who has a progressive national consciousness, consciously wants to dedicate his talent and energy to the salvation movement, and in reality participates in the salvation movement, will not hinder his creative freedom by working with another group of similar writers to engage in collective creation under the slogan of "national defense literature"; because that is exactly what he likes to do. Conversely, if there is a writer who has the same consciousness as Yin Rugeng, then asking him to write literature for national liberation with what kind of technique, and to strive to engage in such collective creation, would really hinder his creative freedom.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the so-called "stereotyped" problem. I think that if collective creation not only has general principles but also orders writers to create with rigid formulas, and even orders them to use certain adjectives and verbs, and to express themselves in certain words and sentences, then the result will be "stereotyped." But in fact, I am afraid that there has never been and will not be such a stupid thing. The collective creation we are talking about is gathering a group of writers with the same understanding (or the same understanding of a certain problem), putting forward unanimously approved creative guidelines, stipulating the main themes, and adopting certain creative methods to work hard in collective work. In this way, every writer in this collective creative life can express one aspect of objective things, can express their special life experiences and artistic talents and even their personality. As a result, the works produced will of course not be "stereotyped," but diverse creations under unified principles. For example, Barbusse, Romain Rolland, and Gide, they all lived a collective creative life, and they all used realistic creative methods to write anti-war literature, but their anti-war works are not "stereotyped"!</p>
<p>At the same time, even narrowly defined collective creation, that is, the matter of several writers jointly creating a work, is not absolutely impossible. However, writers engaged in such collective creation must not only have the same understanding but also have artistic talents that are not too far apart and have very similar styles, because otherwise, the jointly produced works will not be able to achieve consistency in expression. I believe that at present, if there are some talented writers with the same understanding and similar styles who jointly create a huge work in a planned way, it must be quite meaningful, although the first attempt may not be successful. In the current publishing world, we can often see theoretical works co-authored by two or more people, but such literary works are rare. Perhaps the reason is that it is more difficult to create literary works together.</p>
<p>I think that what should and can be urgently implemented at present is group creation, which points out one or more major social phenomena as the theme and requires certain writers with the same understanding to create together to publish a certain creative series or a certain collection of creations; such as those describing rural or working-class life, or those about the national liberation movement, are all necessary at present and should be done immediately.</p>
<p>In short, the current era is already an era of the decline of individualism and the rise of collectivism. Progressive writers should live a collective creative life, engage in collective creation, express collective life, and not be individualistic wandering souls. In collective creative life, one can not only increase one's personal life knowledge and creative experience, but also enhance one's personal role in the group and society. Therefore, we say that collective creation, like the Revenge Snow Revenge that is being screened at the Zhejiang Grand Theater today, is not only possible for progressive writers but also necessary.</p>
<p>As for collective criticism, its historical significance is the same as that of collective creation. There is no need to say more. What is necessary is that progressive critics should also work hard collectively under a unanimously approved program, just like progressive writers. Because the task of criticism is to translate the artistic language of works into sociological language, without the need for vivid descriptions, collective criticism is easier than collective creation. What we can do now is to gather some critics with fundamentally the same understanding and conduct collective criticism on a certain important work, or a certain writer, or a certain literary publication; this can be expressed through various forums, or by publishing opinions in writing together. In the meantime, on the one hand, one can naturally avoid the arbitrariness of one or two critics, and can avoid the rampant formalism, and thus can provide writers with some creative suggestions, and even guide writers in their creation; on the other hand, one can also increase the critical knowledge of critics and make criticism increasingly progressive.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also say that the development of such collective creation will inevitably make the themes and content of collective criticism more abundant; and the efforts of collective criticism will inevitably make collective creation more and more progressive. The two are really mutually beneficial and cannot be discussed separately.</p>
<p>The Secret of the 理教 (Lijiao Sect) Run by Foreign Postal Agencies By Wang Feng</p>
<p>Qiqihar Correspondence</p>
<p>I have been living in Qiqihar for nearly half a year, and I have not written an article for Shen Bao. Half of this is because I am lazy to write, but half is also because there is too much to say, and I feel the pain of "not knowing where to start with a twenty-four history." Now I will briefly describe what I know about the situation of Lijiao in the Northeast.</p>
<p>The power of "Lijiao" - commonly known as "Zaili" - in the Northeast is no less than the power of "Zaijiali" in the Yangtze River Basin. In the lower levels of any place in the Northeast, "Lijiao" has a very strict organization. The hidden power of the "Dao" is really not to be ignored.</p>
<p>It is said that "Lijiao" has a history of fifty years since it developed from the interior to the Northeast. The reason is that it was attacked in the interior by the then Chinese Manchu Qing government, and it thought of opening up new territory in the more loosely ruled border areas. After decades of struggle, it obtained semi-public activities.</p>
<p>"Lijiao" can be said to be a branch of the "Gelaohui" in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Its origin is a secret revolutionary organization with national consciousness of "overthrowing the Qing and restoring the Ming." However, later, "Zaijiali" was bought by the clever Chinese Qing rulers and became "Anqingbang"; similarly, "Lijiao" also suffered the same fate, so now "Zaili" is also called "Zaiqingli." The Chinese Shunzhi Emperor was revered as the founder by the current "Lijiao"; according to the history of the teachings spread by "Lijiao," Shunzhi became the first disciple of the "Old Buddha of the South China Sea" - that is, "Guanyin" - after he became a monk. This is the beginning of "Lijiao" being passed down from the hands of the immortals to the human world.</p>
<p>"Lijiao" regards the "Holy Ancestor of the South China Sea" - that is, "Bodhisattva Guanyin" - as the highest idol of worship; it takes tobacco and alcohol as the precepts of the believers; after being introduced by old believers, there are no strict rules for joining the sect, but only relies on the feudal ethical concepts of "faith and righteousness" to maintain the mutual relationship between believers.</p>
<p>The cells of the organization are based on individual believers as units, adopting pure white autonomy. The highest leader is the "Lingzheng" - commonly called "Dangjia de" or "Daye" - but the believers do not bear any actual responsibility to the "Lingzheng," but only a kind of "moral" respect. The only thing that "Lingzheng" relies on to get the believers' "peng" - meaning support - is the historical relationship. First, the person who is "Lingzheng" must be "old and virtuous." Personal morality is cultivated, lives a celibate life, and the procedure of passing the "Lingfa" is especially important.</p>
<p>"Daoli" is absolutely equal to "Lingzheng," and there is no "portal" faction, which can be said to be a characteristic of the "Lijiao" organization. During the Beiyang government period, "Lijiao" was given great importance. At that time, the highest organization of the "National Association for Abstinence from Tobacco and Alcohol" was established in Beijing, and the "Liduo Bao" was published. The "Gongsuo" all over the country were renamed "Local Abstinence from Tobacco and Alcohol Gongsuo." However, later, because the government was too busy dealing with national affairs, it did not interfere with the affairs of the "private sector." Now, the Northeast, which serves as the base of "Lijiao," has fallen into the hands of others; and "Lijiao" in the country also has a tendency to gradually decline, and this highest organization is even more out of the question.</p>
<p>The followers of Lijiao call each other "Bafang Ye" (Eight Directions Elder). The source of this title is probably that after the Manchus entered the pass at that time, some Ming dynasty officials with integrity were unwilling to be slaves of the conquered country, but were forced by the power of the rulers to drift to the "eight directions" as refugees, and at the same time maintained a considerable secret organization among them. The title of "Bafang Ye" may be the meaning of comrades who feel the same way about their drifting lives.</p>
<p>"Gongsuo" (Public Offices) are the organs for mutual contact between "Bafang Ye." There are banners of certain hall numbers, but there are no self-fighting incidents like "Zaijiali." The "Bafang Ye" of one Gongsuo can go to another Gongsuo to "peng rizi" (support the day).</p>
<p>The "Bafang Ye" have a great spirit of mutual assistance. When a "Bafang Ye" comes from afar, if he feels material difficulties, he can go to the "Gongsuo" of this place for help. After inquiring according to the rules of the sect, he can get the financial assistance of the "Bafang Ye" in the area.</p>
<p>The supporters of the "Gongsuo" are the local "Zhongzheng Ban." These people are mostly local "Guanggun"! - In the South they are called gangsters -, they rely on this group's secret organization and collude with the local political and military forces - During the old Northeast regime, all middle and lower-level military officers were mostly followers of Lijiao - to engage in "illegal lives," such as heading gambling dens, selling drugs, engaging in lawsuits, and communicating with bandits, and all the economic sources of the "Gongsuo" come from these people.</p>
<p>The date of the "Bafang Ye" gatherings is on the first and fifteenth of each lunar month, or other special commemorative days of Lijiao. This kind of gathering is called "Bai Zhai" or "Bai Rizi" or "Zuo Rizi," which is divided into two kinds: "Shun Zhai" and "Gong Zhai." "Shun Zhai" is simpler and ends in just one night; after being introduced, new followers can pay a small amount of "incense money" and hold the ceremony of joining the sect, and old followers can come to "Chaofo" and "Qiu Shun" at will.</p>
<p>The ceremony of "Gong Zhai" is more complicated, lasting for three nights. During these three days, the "Lingzheng" must sit on the "altar" day and night and must not come down; this is impossible for a "Lingzheng" without cultivation. New followers who join the sect on "Gong Zhai" days pay heavier incense money, and old followers also have to donate money, because everyone has to eat, drink, and live in the Gongsuo during these days, and the expenses are very high.</p>
<p>The procedures for new followers to join the sect include "Qiushi" (Seeking a Teacher) and "Yinshi" (Leading a Teacher) in addition to the introducer. The ceremony is very grand. When you are not officially "授理" (authorized), you are never allowed to peek into the secrets, and "攩宗" is responsible for protecting the secrets of the sect. When Lingzheng "點理" (points out the truth), they are dispatched to patrol around the Gongsuo to prevent outsiders from sneaking in. After the new followers' resumes are registered, "護法" (護法) (protectors) pray for you to join the sect in front of each altar. After obtaining the permission of the fellow believers, the "引師" (guide) can come to the altar to guide you in. After strict investigation by the "引師" (guide) at the threshold, you can be introduced to the altar to kneel before the "Lingzheng" to listen to the "點理" (pointing out the truth). At this time, the "Lingzheng" begins to impart the "Five-Character True Words" to you in a very serious attitude and a low voice, and finally encourages you with words such as "respect the elders" and "live in harmony with your neighbors."</p>
<p>The procedures for female believers - called "Er Zhong" (Second Crowd) or "Kunli" - because men are called "Dazhong" (Great Crowd) - are even more complicated. In addition to all the procedures being the same as for men, the utensils on the altar must be changed and replaced when "點理" (pointing out the truth), and the female believers and the "Lingzheng" cannot meet, with a green curtain separating them.</p>
<p>If you eat tobacco and alcohol or the "Five-Character True Words" slip out of your mouth due to illness or carelessness after joining the sect, it is called "破大碗" (breaking the big bowl), and you must go through "Lingzheng" "重點" (re-point out the truth) to be considered to have rejoined the sect, but the procedures are very simple.</p>
<p>The ritual in "Lijiao" is called "下參" (Xia Can), which is more difficult than ordinary kneeling and bowing. It must go through considerable practice to match the body movements. So when you see the "下參" (Xia Can) of "Bafang Ye", you know his Lijiao qualification.</p>
<p>The advancement of the believers is called "得法" (getting the Dharma); the Dharma is used to distinguish the ranks between believers, but there is no specific expression of rights in between. "得法" (getting the Dharma) must be based on the merits and history in the sect as the standard. The "法" (Dharma) is granted by "Lingzheng", mostly梵音的咒語 (Sanskrit mantras), which vary according to the different hall numbers. Below "幫正法" (幫正法), there are "催宗法" (催宗法),</p>

A notice has already been distributed, stating, "Due to the soaring prices of raw materials and the increased costs, the factories have jointly decided to increase the prices of goods by 5% according to the existing price list starting from October 23rd, as a slight remedy. A new price list will be issued later. This is unavoidable, and we hope for your understanding. Furthermore, as a preferential treatment, orders placed by all customers will still be calculated at the original price, provided that a 30% deposit is paid within this month and sent directly to the factories to obtain a formal order form, in order to maintain good faith. In case of any omissions, this notice is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>Xue Mai Luo Robbery Case: Zhang Zuming Appeals, Accuses Zhou Jinggeng, et al. of False Accusation; Loses Initial Trial, Now Appeals</h3>
<p>Zhou Jinggeng, compradore of the Xue Mai Luo accounting firm at 5 Edward Road in the French Concession, sent someone to the China Industrial Bank on June 5th, 1934 to collect 18,000 yuan in new banknotes. Upon returning to the firm, armed robbers broke in and stole 12,000 yuan. After reporting the incident to the authorities, detectives apprehended four suspects: Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Zai Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, and sent them to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. At the conclusion of the trial, Zhang and the others were found not guilty. After three confirmed trials, Zhang Zuming hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the criminal division of the Second Special Court against Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti'e, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, Wang Guixiang, and others for false accusation, along with a civil suit seeking 50,000 yuan in damages. After Judge Chen Shuoying concluded the trial, Zhou Jinggeng and others were found not guilty, and the civil suit was dismissed. This has been reported in this newspaper. Zhang Zuming, dissatisfied with the verdict, has appealed to the High Third Branch Court. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Criminal Division Chief Wu Tingqi, along with judges Liao and Wang Yue, and prosecutor Dong Qiming, convened a collegial panel in Criminal Court Three to hear the case. Both parties were accompanied by their lawyers. The court first questioned the appellant about the grounds for the appeal, and then questioned the appellee, Zhou Jinggeng, about the robbery and the circumstances of withdrawing the money, as well as the details of the arrest of the appellants. Gao Yushu and others were questioned separately. The court then ordered the closing arguments to be made, announced the conclusion of the hearing, and scheduled the verdict for the 19th.</p>

<h3>British Sailors Visited Guandi Temple Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Li Ao Kui Organizes the Continental News Agency</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Li Ao Kui initiated the organization of the Continental News Agency. The reasons are as follows: "In recent years, China's news industry has gradually developed. Although there are no accurate statistics on the number of newspapers published in various provinces and cities, it is estimated that there are hundreds or thousands. The establishment of news agencies is also increasing daily. Leaving aside remote areas, even in Shanghai alone, the organization of news gathering is like bamboo shoots after rain, flourishing day by day. This phenomenon shows that China's cultural level is gradually improving, and it also reflects society's emphasis on news. The advancement of national civilization requires news to guide it. Establishing a nation today cannot be compared to the era of closed doors and isolation. With smooth transportation and frequent contact, there is even more need for the widespread dissemination of news. Therefore, various European and American countries, in addition to working hard on newspaper operations, are also making tireless efforts in organizing news gathering, such as Reuters, Havas, United Press, TASS, and other agencies, all of which are well-known. As for Japan, its facilities related to the news industry are even more proactive. The so-called news network plan has already been realized. This is known to everyone. Therefore, when China is compared with other countries, it still feels far behind. The distance cannot be measured in miles. Moreover, the relationship between news agencies and newspapers is extremely close, like interdependent vehicles, inseparable. Those with insight have already realized this, but still cannot compete with advanced countries. What is the reason? It is limited by manpower and resources. For example, China's agriculture, industry, and commerce have all been in dire straits recently. The rural economy has collapsed, and industrial and commercial enterprises have become increasingly bleak. However, it is often difficult to know the truth. This is because the news gathering agencies have not fully performed their duties, resulting in newspapers lacking systematic information. Even the gathering of news on politics, education, social sports, etc., although progressing on the road of competition, is still unable to fully develop due to the limitations of manpower and resources, failing to meet the expectations of the people. Having seen this, we and our colleagues have gathered like-minded people to establish this agency, hoping to contribute our modest efforts to make up for the shortcomings. We hope that our fellow countrymen will supervise and guide us. We would be most fortunate."</p>
<h3>National Goods Federation Sends Letter Requesting Factories to Report Products, Submit to Ministry to be Included in National Goods List, Distributed to Various Agencies for Adoption</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation sent a letter yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, the China Federation, the Production and Sales Association, the Mechanical Industry Federation, the National Manufacturers Federation, and the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, stating: "We received a notice from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on October 22nd, which stated, 'It has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to handle the association's request that the government reiterate the previous order for government agencies to purchase national goods. If there are national goods substitutes but foreign goods are still purchased, reimbursement should not be allowed. The Ministry should formulate concrete measures as soon as possible to implement this. (Omission)... There are still many national goods items that have not been legally registered with the Ministry. The association should quickly and accurately investigate and instruct the national goods factories to legally register with the Ministry and obtain national goods certificates, so that a national goods list can be prepared and distributed to various agencies for adoption.' We approve of this. The method indicated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is very practical. If national manufacturers throughout the country quickly submit their products to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for national goods certificates, and the Ministry includes them in the national goods elimination list and distributes them to various agencies for adoption, the results will be considerable. In addition to sending separate letters, we are hereby requesting you to include this in your communication and inform all trade associations, employees, factories, and stores, as well as chambers of commerce in various provinces, cities, and counties, to handle this matter accordingly."</p>

<h3>Woman Unable to Raise Child After Childbirth; Husband Abandons Her; Both Children Sent to Hospital for Care</h3>
<p>On the 14th of last month, Huang Fu, who claimed to be a tea server at the Great China University on Zhongshan Road, was nearly 30 years old and resided at No. 5, Lane 741, Julai Road in the French Concession. His wife, Huang Zhang, was 26 years old, from Wenzhou. Because she was pregnant and suffered from a severe fever, Huang accompanied her to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. On the 18th of the same month, she was transferred to the obstetrics department of the hospital because she was about to give birth. She subsequently gave birth to twin girls. Later, Huang claimed that he did not have the funds to pay for medical expenses and that he would return home to raise funds, but he left and never returned. It has been more than a month since then, and there has been no news. She has recovered from her illness in the hospital and her confinement period has expired, so she should be discharged from the hospital immediately. The hospital sent someone to the address Huang reported, No. 5, Lane 741, Ju Xiangda Road, but it was the residence of a Westerner and no one named Huang lived there. Because the hospital was unable to place the mother and daughters, it reported to the French Concession police the day before, and the detectives took the mother and daughters to the police station for questioning. Only then did they learn that Huang Fu's real name was Ji Zhenting, and that she was Ji Wu. Detectives went to Great China University to investigate and confirmed that there was indeed a Ji Zhenting who worked as a tea server and had taken leave from school half a month ago, whereabouts unknown. Yesterday morning, the police sent Ji Wu and the two children to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court and requested a decision. After Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned Ji Wu, she confessed that she was unable to raise the children and was willing to send the two children to the hospital. The court verified the information and ruled that Ji Wu was allowed to go out and seek employment, and the two children would be temporarily placed in the Guangci Hospital for care.</p>
