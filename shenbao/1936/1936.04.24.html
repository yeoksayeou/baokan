<h3 id="c19">有田外交之檢討 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>自有田八郞以駐華大使而調任日外相以後其所抱負之外交經綸已表現於事實者有外交陣容之整飭有打破外交向例之人事調遷有陸海外三省經常每週恊議會之設立而其所懸之標的一則曰國防外交之一元化再則曰因循計劃之積極化近旬以來日外務省爲决定其外交新方針分向各方徵詢意見而以　由所謂赤化之威脅巾救出東亞方策以及　開拓日本通商經濟新路之根本方針兩問題爲討論之中心本月十九日日外相在議會之演辭所論雖洋洋灑灑然吾人核其要義亦不外以此二點爲其政策遂行之中心是則有田之外交與廣田外交在運用之手段上在進行之程序上具有若干不同之性質固已昭然若揭矣</p>
<p>吾人試就目前有田外交加以分析當可得一明晰之概念卽以對蘇政策爲重心而使對華對英關係建築在良好基礎之上此中關鍵就是所謂共同防共問題亦卽所謂三原則的活用之初步的表現其次在以「東方的警犬」自居之任務之下施用緩和策略避免增强英美諸國之反感其目的企圖以誘惑手段求英美諸國與日本站在同一之立塲承認日本在東亞之特殊地位探求英日美間對華利益之恊調再進而作世界市塲之重新劃分之討論此種政策吾人可以稱之爲東亞獨占政策之活用固不若軍部外交之完全以槍桿爲手段亦不若官僚外交之徒然拘泥於形式也</p>
<p>所以有田外交之特質卽基於所謂活用的基礎之上而其陣容則建立在外海陸藏四省一致態度之下此種趨向實爲日本外交之新的轉變吾人試觀最近日閣任命駐津總領川越之使華以及重光葵使俄之傳說要皆爲在此種方針下而决定之人事異動其前途之進展足爲吾人注意者一爲微妙的動盪中之英日關係一爲所謂一元化外交之演進一爲東亞大陸現實情勢之推移凡此皆足以影響有田之整個對外政策</p>
<p>循是以觀中日關係之前途其未容吾人作過分之樂觀乃是顯而易見之事實日本已整飭其陣容整齊其步伐以與我週旋矣我國肆應之術又將何如此國人於檢討有田外交政策之餘所應警惕者也</p>

<p>— DrRalphW.Chaney原著　陳紹燕譯</p>
<p>各著作家曾經討論過，他們都相信這些獸類，只會在硬核一端，齧一個小孔，决不會將全核嚼成碎塊，就是松鼠　開胡桃一類果實，也是這個樣子的。在加利弗尼亞大學試騐所裏，曾將乾燥的樸實，餒給籠中豢養的齧齒類勁物，但是結果它們並不那麼愛吃這一類食物，並且也不習慣，因爲它們吃所給予的硬核時從來沒有嚼到裏面去。</p>
<p>在籠裏飼養猴子的行爲，更是顯著了。它們很敏捷地接了這些乾朵過去，將全部都嚼碎了，把果肉和核的碎塊，一併吞下肚去。但是在冰河時期中，大家知道中國北部是沒有猴子生存着的。因此洞內所積存的硬核碎塊，就該是古代窰洞中居民的食物的遺棄物，也可稱爲垃圾的化名，而不是齧齒類動物所遺留的。</p>
<p>由此看來，這就可算是人類在有史以前，以植物爲食品的最早紀錄了。在這樣寒冷和乾燥的地方，新鮮的果實和堅果是少有的，我們可以假定那時的「北京人」從他的老家相近的灌木裏，把這些樸實採集了來，並且將他榨碎了，來佐理他的餐食，和現代美國西南部的土人一樣。這些在洞內所積存的大量硬核碎塊，最好是這樣的解釋。</p>
<p>「北京人」頭蓋骨的腦腔，很明白地顯示淸這種早期人類是能夠講話的。在我們的想像里，彷彿能够聽到「北京女人，」用那消失了百萬年的語言呌「北京孩子，」吃樸實布丁。</p>
<p>當我將要離開這中國北部小山上做過一百萬年前古代人的老家的巖洞的時候。和我同去的中國同伴們，很客氣的給我一個機會，在洞裏選擇一塊角礫石帶了去。當時我從洞中發掘出來的一堆材料裏拾起了一塊，秤起來大概有兩磅重，這塊石上所顯露的是許多燒焦骨殖的碎塊，和一塊大的石英片段。因爲石上有一端欠整齊需要修理一下，所以用我的鐵鎚把他鑿下來。我是如何的驚異，在這塊角礫石的斷面所見的幾乎全是樸實的仁！</p>
<p>這雖然僅是一塊石頭，但其中所包藏的，不但是人類歷史以前的食品餘物，裏面有肉類也有植物，並且也有粗糙的石器，這些工具是「北京人」用以殺野牛切鮮肉和打碎那樸實的，這些巖洞內的存積物，在人類用文字紀錄古人類生活的詳情以前，告訴我們古人類飲食習慣的一切了。岩洞裏堆積的樸核碎壳</p>

<p>租界當局認為尋常舞塲爭吵事件　破案綫索係小廣東抵押手槍而得　——西文書籍內掘有手槍模型之洞——</p>

<p>破案經過</p>
<p>中山秀雄死後、日軍司令部及公共租界捕房、皆派深員馳抵出事地點調查、當塲曾檢獲B．P．牌手槍一支、證明殺中山秀雄者即屬此槍、嗣有人投捕房報告、謂彼嘗見有名小廣東者、前以與此同一牌號之手槍一支、向粵人曾元抵借欵項、捕房乃查傳曾元其人到來、而預將手槍數支、連同所獲之槍、經曾元審視之下、隨取出所獲之槍、謂係小廣東昔日之抵押品、因其欵已償還、故槍亦返之、於是捕房即着手偵查小廣東之踪跡、初以毫無綫索、故數月以來、竟不明其去向、最近偵知小廣東正青島、遂於旬日之前、遴派幹探、乘輪赴青、將小廣東拘獲、至上星期日小廣東尙未押解到滬、而捕房已在某處又獲華人甲·乙·兩名、並在甲之寓處搜出西文書籍一冊、書內掘有一絕似手槍模型之洞、當將以所獲之手槍嵌入、則毫厘不差、甲乃被認為與有關係、而乙以與甲往頗密、故連帶被捕、本星期一午、捕房爰先將甲·乙·兩人解至第一特院、由蕭爕棻推事二度提審、即飭還押、翌晨小廣東已自青島解到、隨送法院、由馮世德推事提訊一過、亦飭還押、現聞定期下星期一將該三人一併解院續審、</p>

<p>關於修正憲法草案問題、日來中樞要人、紛紛集議、頗引起各方注意、記者特往訪憲法學家本市政府秘書章淵若氏、於其寓所、承發表其關於實施憲政問題之意見、語頗精闢、茲錄如次、</p>
<p>章氏略謂關於憲法頒布施行問題、余早經注意、去年五月間、曾草專文刋於各大報、答憲草委員會副委員長吳經熊先生、關於憲法應如何施行、應如何設暫時條欵、以謀補救、會列舉各國憲法史實與具體條欵、貢獻當局、雖當時各方於理論上頗為欣賞、實際上却未為採納、今者王亮疇先生海外歸來、當局注意及此、深用欣慰、</p>
<p>實施憲政、固為一國長治久安之要圖、然倘使實施、不得其方、亦可釀成變亂之源、民國以來、政局俶擾、推源禍始、莫不起於憲政問題、故實施憲政、實為中國治亂之重要關鍵、往事歷歷、可為殷鑑、</p>
<p>以往吾國論憲者之通病、大都僅注意到憲法的「體」、而示注意到憲法之「用」、僅事「死」的條文的摹擬、而不重「活」的憲政的運用、不知憲法乃為歷史　的產物、亦係民族實際生活之反應、其本身旣不能「不脛而行」、自非隨意制定、所能行而有效、所以今日　憲政問題之心、並不在憲文體例的定備與詳盡實在憲政運用的靈便與與有效、現在憲草旣已判定當然不能不頒布、但頒布是一事、施行又為一事、未可混為一談、倘於頒布與施行的過程中、能亟謀妥善過渡的辦法、則亡羊補牢、事猶可為、否則如躐等了歷史演進的必然階段、萬一行而無效、行而有病、則變亂之來、將不堪設想矣、</p>
<p>查建國大　、蘭於憲法公布旅行、規定頗為審　、一則曰「憲法草案、當本於建國大綱及訓政憲政兩時期之成績、由立法院議訂、隨時宣傳於民衆、以備到時採擇施行」、再則曰「全國有過半數省分、達至憲政時期即全省自治完全成立時期、則開國民人會、决定宪法而頒布之」、由後之說、則憲法之頒布以及國民大會之召開、均應以地方自治之完成為前提、由前之說、則憲法之議訂、旣應本實際訓政之成績、而憲法之施行、尤應待相當的時期、</p>
<p>此種辦法、固合國情、考諸世界各國憲政的常規與中實、亦無乖謬、例如芬蘭波蘭、其憲法的施行、另以法律規定之、如暹辦憲法、雖自公布日施行、但須受暫時條文的制限、如立陶宛憲法的施行、則須於十年內經國民公决核准之、如普魯士憲法公布後、僅三十一——四三及八六諸條發生效力、其餘諸條、應俟新選舉完成後施行之、即如英法憲政典型之邦、其憲法施行之初亦僅限於某一部分、以後始加補充、而漸臹完備、中國人民、政治能力、尚甚薄弱、而訓政工作、尤多未完成、此時憲法、自萬萬不能僅求條文的完備、而應顧及實際運用時的種種困難、凡老成謀國之於、均應力避客氣、不唱高調、為中國憲政謀一妥善的補救辦法、聞章氏日內有暇、或將另草專文、以貢當局云、</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>不論男女，在人生的歷程上，都必定要經過一個靑春時期。在這個時期裹面，是含着十分重要性的，凡人之一生的健康及幸福，都有很大的關係。一般男女靑年們呀！我很希望你們要認淸自己前途的責任，必須要有健康的軀體和毅勇的志氣—努力的去進取，這才是好男兒大丈夫！千萬別要把道個靑春時期淡漠視之，犯上手淫……等等不良的惡習，　傷身體，損害神經，以致精神萎靡不振，形成一個「生無益，死無害」神經衰弱的病夫！</p>
<p>神經衰弱，是靑年界男女都容易發生的疾患，所以又稱為靑年病。在社會裹面有千萬靑年受其蠱毒，呻吟於慘痛生活中。致使前途有為的靑年，一變而為可憐無用的殘身，人生幸福，盡付東流。這是何等可怕的疾病呀！</p>
<p>神經衰弱的病徵，大概是：終日感覺頭暈，頭痛，缺乏生活力，心緒徬徨，思想遲鈍，記憶减退，視力短淺，無勇氣，無决斷力，四肢疲軟，腰痠背痛，精神憂鬱，惡夢難眠，胃脹胸痛，消化不良，面容憔悴，雖在壯盛之年，已呈衰邁老態。</p>
<p>神經衰弱，幷非不治之病，患者若注意攝養，行有規列之生活，戒除手淫惡習，避免心身過勞，禁用刺戟性食物，內服「米美爾補腦汁」MEMORY　NEUROTIC即可恢復已衰退之神經活力，生機活潑，則上述一般病微，自能迅見消失，轉弱為强，得重享人生的福利！</p>
<p>靑年們！要知道國難日深一日，未來的國家光榮，未來的民族復興，未來的國家和民族前途的福利，這一副十分艱重而困難的祖子，都是放在你們的肩上，大家不可不注意啊！</p>
<h3 id="c166">靑年婦女應該知道—健美身心— <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 魏月圓</p>
<p>女子的健美。任何人皆知的朕兆是月經。月經若照常的來潮。按期的反復時。大概共性的機能。不呈何種異常狀態。同時可知其身體也無什麽變化。當然是健美活潑。</p>
<p>月經正常。就是表示女子身體的健全。若是月經不順。這就是表示女子身體的病弱。所以月經為女子身體健否的測定表。我每見青年的婦女。顏色蒼白。精神憂鬱。身體衰弱。一經診察和探詢的結果。十有九人。都是月經發生了異常的緣故。</p>
<p>月經不調所發的病狀。大概是月經前後苦痛。出血。和其他種種排泄物。—白帶—下腹和腰部大多數感覺脹痛。以外頭痛。不眠。肩酸。心跳。飲食不振。嘔氣。便秘。小便過多。當時也有帶着疼痛。此外也有頭暈。疲勞。麻痺。浮腫。感覺腫脹。全身怠惰。性感軟弱的。性交時疼痛。因人而不同。這些病症的容態。由患者自身的陳述。可以知道實是不少數</p>
<p>靑年婦女罹患月經病的悲慘狀態。眞是苦不堪言。破壞夫婦的美夢。引起家庭的不和。因為精神的苦悶。將靑春健美的幸福。完全銷蝕在這個月經痛苦之中。是何等可惜。那末。月經的障碍。須及早施以適當療法。且要注意攝生。切不可輕視忽略的。</p>
<p>患者須使精神安靜。避免一切的刺戟。修養身心。絕對的不可過勞。倘是血虧的關係。必須多食滋養物。或服用「康氏生活」滋補血夜。使體力迅速恢復。</p>
<p>至於調經的藥劑。在臨床上最有效果者。為「美奴寗」Menorrin此係各國專門醫師所一致推獎的。著者近年來對於婦人科的疾病—月經不調—赤白帶—等症。均用本品治療。確有美滿之成績。婦女一切痛苦。都得於極短期內雲消霧散。還復健美之樂。</p>

<p>— 徐生章</p>
<p>肺癆為一種慢性疾病，最易消耗體力，且身體表弱則抵抗病毒之力亦减衰而病勢乃益甚，故治療上對於榮養物之補給，實屬必要。榮養佳良，體力健旺，方能與結核菌相抵抗而促病狀之治愈。</p>
<p>人命之生存，全賴營養，况肺病患者之精華，已為癆菌削伐殆盡，故子榮養之補給尤為緊要，不容忽視。</p>
<p>吾人所需之榮養料，雖能在飲食物中攝取。但肺病病人之胃腸薄弱，多現食慾不振及消化不良，食品中縱有豐富的營養素，惟不能盡量吸收，結果仍隨大便排出，毫無利益，故食品之榮養價，對於肺病未足盡信，宜於食餌以外，加用人工滋養劑，補共不足。</p>
<p>按諸醫家之臨床報告，凡肺癆病者於服用「肺活」Phith　Weal施行根本治療外，同時幷服「康氏生活素」Conbour＇ｓ　San－Vita－Cell補給其榮養，則為加速療治肺結核之惟一良好捷徑。</p>
<p>「康氏生活素Conour＇s　San－Vila　Cel為人體中之生活要素Amino　Acid，Yita－Min等名貴補劑所製成，其功效能鼓勵細胞，以促進新陳代謝，而使全身精神煥發，增進消化液的分泌，以助食物消化，而直接滋養人體，造血肥肌，旺盛人體所有生活機能，對於疾病之抵抗力，允為強大，故無論根據學理或事實，皆證明為無上之有價補劑，且性極純和，毫無副作用，冬夏咸宜服用，凡身弱體虧之患，如常服本品補血強精，健腦益智，確有偉效，肺病作為榮養療法之補助劑，可事半功倍，本輕利重，為計之得，無過於此。</p>
<h3 id="c168">肺癆病之澈底治療不必遠求 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 徐生章</p>
<p>自宅經濟療養為最賢明之方法　服用「肺活」極合理之治療</p>
<p>肺癆病欲求澈底之治療。幷不一定要轉地療養。蓋氣候與空氣對肺病非直接的有效。其根本的療法。全在革新生活。即在自宅療養者。若能確實奉行空氣安靜榮養等攝生。及適當之藥劑療法。亦可得完美之效果。</p>
<p>肺癆病係慢性症候。欲得痊愈。治療期需極長久。費時失業。耗財允巨。故患者須有支持長期之計畫。方為賢明之方法。倘不甚富裕之病家。如在自宅療養。祇須稍稍更改其居室之構造。（使能適合空氣療法）。注意一般衛生。服用確有特效之「肺活」Phith　Weal（本品可補助生理上自然治療之機能）。其所得結果。有優於轉地療養之好成績。</p>
<p>在自宅療養者。因其不需多大費用。可以無憂無慮。安然養生。即如飯食與看護等方面。亦以家庭為自由舒適。决非住院或轉地所可及。於是。而在自宅作長期經濟療養。豈不更為安逸。且此法合於大衆生活。無論何人。皆易實行。故肺病之澈底治療。只有自宅療養。可達到目的。不必遠求。</p>
<p>患者須知在自宅作長期經濟療養。奉行空氣安靜榮養諸療法。服用「肺活」Phith　Weal即為肺病澈底治療之秘訣。若不明斯理。捨近就遠。徒自東奔西走。以為祇須轉地即可治病。實則時時破壞其肺部之病灶的堤防。致使病勢蔓延及於全肺。因轉地反而增劇或喪失其生命者。余屢見不鮮。此蓋由於不知療養法之根本。不知安靜療法之重要。本當仰臥不可勞動。而今反使奔走。舟車勞頓其身體。病安得不進行乎。</p>

<p>— 草明</p>
<p>被人叫做賊婆的四妹回到鄕里不上幾個鐘頭，全村的人便都知道了。</p>
<p>她那付鼓得像個麵包的有勁的面孔，肥短的身軀和不調和地加在她身上的綢衣，金鐲，手錶，實石戒指巳經道樣平凡地屢次在人們眼里出現，因此人們對她的熱烈的好奇心也就慢慢地淡下來，雖然女人們碰着她的時候還對她做出親熱的樣子，並且彷彿在很留心地聽着她底夾雜許多不正確的省城音和新名詞的冗贅的話語。</p>
<p>我還沒有忘記前回四妹回鄕，我一個很疏遠的嬸嬸輩，用許多無聊的詞句，多餘的笑聲陪四妹談了半個多鐘頭工夫，而當四妹擰轉身子離開了她的時候，她就抿着嘴唇，非常輕蔑地說：</p>
<p>「那自由女，唔，那賊婆，能夠養出一個有屁股的兒子來麽。身上的東西，不曉得是從誰家搶得來的……」</p>
<p>我當時曾經這樣問我底堂嬸：一但你剛才對她不這個樣子！」</p>
<p>她被我這句話傷害了，沒有回答我，只在臨走的時候回過頭來鼓大眼睛說：</p>
<p>「吿訴你，這就是敎你怎樣去做人！」</p>
<p>我碰到叫妹是在她回鄕後的第三天早晨。</p>
<p>「去飲杯茶吧，到順與樓飲茶去吧。」她這樣請求着我。她底矮壯的身段倚靠在汶瀾橋鐵欄上，晨風吹拂她底整理不講究的頭髪；兩修手臂雖然短，但動作得很敏捷；說話充分地帶住淺薄的豪放。綜合她那些勇敢，潑辣，兇猛，小孩子似的直爽的一切動作——在鄕聞是難以找到這樣的人物的。她說話底急促，眼睛底不安的溜動，腦袋和手底靈敏的旋轉，都顯示她是習慣了那種冒險的流動的生活。</p>
<p>「那兒很多男人。」我不同意她。</p>
<p>「算了吧，這有什麽問題！學堂女還這樣扭扭揑揑。我底兒子也是男人哩。」她一面說一面嚇嚇地笑着，用手狠狠地拍了我底肩膊一下。依了我底意思，她挺起胸脯，擺着兩條手臂，臉孔每分鐘都彷彿在對着一個很親熱的朋友似地，從順興樓買了一大包飽子回來。</p>
<p>我們穿過汶瀾橋，走進桑基對過的七里亭。她吃着，不停地說着在我聽來完全沒味的話。後來她換一個方式，指着她底金首飾，詳細地說着那一個式樣現在上海頂流行，什麽石比什麽石値錢。</p>
<p>「唉，我現在差一顆上好的金剛鑽，我頂愛牠！你呢，你頂愛什麽？就我身上的來說吧。」</p>
<p>「這一切都不能使你榮耀起來的。全鄕的人都瞧不起你！」</p>
<p>太陽露着半截身子，週圍慢慢變熱起來。桑業輕輕抖搜着，振作起精神準備抵抗太陽的威炎。我心裏感到不愉快，這時候我應該對四妹說些什麽呢？她似乎沒有聽懂我底話；望住我，嚇嚇地笑起來了。靜默了好一會，她分辯地說道：</p>
<p>「當我在絲廠裏做工的時候，也沒有誰看得起我過，人們好像一輩子沒有空給我說話！—但是現在他們反而……唉，這些東西難道我是白搶回來的麽？」她又玩弄着她底裝飾品，她對於牠們正像小孩子對於自己的玩具一樣，不是為了必要而是為了高興。</p>
<p>她底强硬使我感到了懊惱，我把我底意思簡單化起來說：「我是在說一個人底人格！假使人底心靈染上了污點，那麽雖然拿來鍍了金也是掩飾不來的！」</p>
<p>「哦，人格，對了，我在省城的時候也聽見過這個名詞。阿明，你讀過兩年學堂，也許懂得多一點；但趁一個人終歸要吃飯的，在世界上，只要拿出自己的膽量，拿出自己的力氣，拿出自己的主意，那麽他不是有人格麽？唔，人格不像金錢，給人們藏起來的；誰要就誰去拿，我不等人家分給我，也不去搶人家的，對不對呢，嚇嚇……」為了闡明她底主張，她底雙手和五官更活躍起來，不休止地說着，像一刻也不肯放鬆我底注意力。「無非都是為了吃飯問題吧了。有什麽分別呢？——摘桑，挑繭，繅絲，當私娼，做强盜……任你說吧，你從這裏面給我挑選一樣較為高貴的事業吧！你知道，一個人常會碰着「不容你選擇』的時侯的。……至於明天，我是不管這些的，我也不知道什麽叫德行，什麽叫法律；明知明天要蹺辮子，也不願意今天捱餓啊！我只知道要活，我只知道找碗飯吃！……」她底屁股突然離開石凳，在亭子裏面跳躍着，叫嚷起來。</p>
<p>看她的樣子有點興奮了，但她永遠是這樣快活而自信，彷彿在她腦裏，沒有一樣恐怖和可怕的事情。她還是燥急地跳來跳去，像熱鍋上的螞蟻，嘴裏不住地咒詛熱天，一面用手當作扇子搧着。</p>
<p>「只知道活——道是對的，你更要知道應該怎樣活法。有些活法是會毀滅我們底靈魂的……！」</p>
<p>她似乎不願意我再說下去，用話岔開我。</p>
<p>「喂，你快要當一個女敎員了吧？可是我連做你底學生也沒有資格。這樣熱的天氣叫我怎過呢？剛回來兩天，又厭煩起來了，我再不能過這樣安安穩穩的生活。我明天就要回騰沖去了，說不定就是今天，唉！……」</p>
<p>不曉得為了一件什麽很小的事情，她一隻蚱蜢似地離開七里亭。我一個人獃在亭裏想了好久，在想這個魅惑的女人。</p>
<h3 id="c218">「泰初有為」 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 立波</p>
<p>——讀哥德的「浮士德」有感——</p>
<p>在書齋裏「景慕生之川，暴慕生之源」的浮士德博士，又在經歷着生活的焦渴之中的煩惱了。為了補救他的生活的空虛缺陷，他展開希伯萊文的聖經，想在中間找到一些「尊貴而優美」的啟示。他翻譯了一句「泰初有道」，覺得「道」字士不分明，又譯成「泰初有心」，「心」又不能創造宇宙萬有，第三决他寫成「泰初有力」，又心乎不當，終於，他「下筆如神」的，將「約翰福音」第一句譯成「泰初有為」（In　the　beginoingwas　the　deed）。他歡喜的笑了。</p>
<p>不管「浮士德」後來的發展怎樣，這眞是一個「尊貴而優美」的啟示。</p>
<p>久遠不會褪色的，是生活寫成的書籍。最有價值的是包含着行為的言語，也就是行為積疊而成的言語。世界上有很多在排色的紗窗之下，閑玩字句的文士，也有終其一生，摸撫着脫離了生活的侏儒腐論而沾沾自喜的寡學的博士，但他們一看見耀眼的生活的光明，就都要變成萎縮或蒼白。</p>
<p>認識幾個字，原也可以把實踐的理論，學得一些，將意識形態，照抄斷片吧。可是人生的暴風雨到來時，他格外要使人感到遺憾了。在他生活上原是外來之物的意識形態，會被他葬送或糟榻；他的生活的進程最終遵奉的，還是自己的動物的階層利害和心理，而那Second-handed的意識形態，就要露出牠和生活之間的破綻，或竟全部遭遺棄，或者，好像大風裏的褪色的落葉，脫離了生命的枝椏，還想在半空掙扎，卻終於要飄落到何處的泥沼裏。</p>
<p>况且，就是一鱗半爪的學舌，人工的織補，也正不容易。在純正的理論之外，還可能因襲多少俗見和徧見！什麽最能消毒這些一切的毒素，除了行為？這個社會，充滿了謊騙，我們用什麽來防役謊騙的傳染，除了行為？</p>
<p>所貴於理論，是因為牠是把現實的歷史運動中人類行為的經騐，加以取　整理，再又作用於現實的歷史運動之上的緣故。現實的歷史運動，幾微萬變，理論一離開牠，就要鬧錯，或竟流於空虛與無用。</p>
<p>歐洲現代資產社會的文明，養育了詹姆斯·喬易斯和馬色·布勞斯特一流作家，喬易斯的眼睛老是落在人間現實的許多糞堆之上，他的作品只有那末多俗惡的拍照，沒有半點詩的氣質；偉大的現實主義者巴爾扎克似乎說過，能夠發掘現實中的那成為詩的東西，就算是人的天才的一半了。然而，在沒落期的資產社會裏，是不能夠產生這種有詩的氣質的天才的。馬色。布勞斯特躺在華麗的沙龍裏，天天望着天花板，他寫什麽呢，天花板天天一樣？他的現實是多麽單調無味呵。於是我們又看到了現代文學的另外一畸形現象：在瞬息萬變的社會現實之旁，有布勞斯特一流太吃飽了的紳士，從現實避開，在可憐的發散着「夢的微音」（高爾基語）</p>
<p>藝術思想家的哥德曾經指示，文學，應當是詩和眞實的混成物。資產社會，不能產生偉大的詩人，同時也沒有忠實的描寫社會現實的眞實的著作者。糞的分析和「夢的微音」，成了他們的全般文學的巨大的誇耀。</p>
<p>我國的現實主義者，原是一開始就和社會運動結着不解的因緣的。可是，目前，一部分的文學者似乎隱隱約約的有一種煩厭社會生活，輕視目前全民族的實際運動的傾向。這傾向的前途是什麽呢？我國連產生布勞斯特和喬易斯的藝術的條件也不具備，如果有着和他們的空虛生活相同的傾向的人，那末他，至多不過成為一個不成功的布勞斯特，或更衰弱更渺小的喬易斯。</p>
<p>我們要求有豐富的現實知識和激越的詩的精神的作家。我們要求作家，為了自己的藝術的成就，同時也就是為了中華民族和牠的文化前途之故，更摯愛的愛好並滲進當前扎掙的現實運動。我們要遵照黑格爾的不朽的訓諭：對於世界史，對於全社會要具有最大的關心，我們的主題應該是在這種關心之下描寫出的世界與人間的必然的行動。</p>
<p>一切偉大的作家都是這樣的。他們經歷着豐富的實際生活，而且終身摯愛牠。高爾基，巴比塞，羅曼羅蘭，紀德，他們的歡喜和煩惱大都是關心人類歷史的社會感情的流露，他們的理智都是歷史運動的戰將的理智。</p>
<p>一切偉大的理論家，都在現實運動的奔流之上，不斷洗濯他們的理論，這樣，才保證了他們的理論永遠新鮮，康健，豐富而有力，「讓在風暴雨，更猛烈的吹打吧！」我們最大的詩人寫下來的有名的詩句，那位天才的理論家是怎樣熱情的反覆吟味了，當他一方面在寫着輝煌的指導理論的時候。</p>
<p>現在中華民族人民解放的在風暴雨，巳經夠猛烈了。這是我們一個多麽有為的時候，作家和理論家！讓我們也唱那歡迎風雨的飛鳥之歌罷！或者是讓我們提起博學的浮士德傾慕人生的詩句：</p>
<p>我覺得這樣的才算是幸福的人，</p>
<p>或者是死在陣上頭戴血染的榮冠，</p>
<p>或者是在舞之後抱在一位姑娘的手腕，</p>
<p>要是我們的姑娘們也行將做人奴婢的話，我們將更决定的愛了前面兩行詩句吧？</p>
<h3 id="c219">號角 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>

<p>聽那號角的聲音，</p>
<p>那悲凉的幽怨的調子，</p>

<p>那在遠方和近處呼應着的</p>
<p>風給帶向全世界播揚。</p>

<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>冷落的某馬路，這時突然增加了熱鬧。天成印刷所門外的人行道上，全擠滿了形色不同的男女人們。</p>
<p>誰都有點惘然：枯黃而陰鬱的臉上，全都簇蒲付灰垢堆積的黑眉，全都炯炯地發着碧緣的兩眼，全都把兩張紫灰色的嘴唇披呀披的，想說什麽，但又沒說什麽。</p>
<p>「哦！呵！」</p>
<p>一個人這麽歎了口氣，彷彿明白了那是什麽一回事似的。別的人也馬上像受了傳染似的，接遞地打起呵欠來：</p>
<p>「哦！呵！」</p>
<p>天成印刷所的中門開着，兩邊玻窗上的排門板還沒有卸下。人就像條黑流似的直從中門衝了進去。小小的印刷間，左面是櫃台，右面一架石印機，靠里搭張床舖，東西極其簡單。誰也看不出誰是主人，綠着眼相互瞧着。祇有一個中年的婦人，老着付白色的瓢兒臉，朝外的站在床前。於是向里擠的人，全把眼光停在那人身上，却把自己的嘴，湊到不相識者的耳朵邊去，瞧着耳着後的積垢，聞着頭髮的油奧，相互的問着：「怎麽一回事啦？」</p>
<p>但自己底話還沒有說完，那邊彷彿有人湊過嘴來，像睡在床上聽蚊子的叫聲似地：『偷……偷……</p>
<p>一個女人馬上紅　臉來了。她搔ｇ　搔自己剪短的頭髮，瞧瞧床前站着的女人；她想：「一個女人會偷什麽呢？」她全身發着熱，她再瞧瞧那女人，嚴然變成自已背着丈夫開鬥接納過的那個可愛的男子的臉。她又想：「人眞是個奇怪的東西，哪個女人會對自已丈夫一輩子滿足呢，——誰又不曾做過缺德的事！」——咳！」於是她像安定自己的心似的咳嗽一下，「怎麽——這樣擠人呀！」再叫了一聲，把手肘打在別人肚子上，想擠出門外去。</p>
<p>被打的人是個大個子。肚子一受震動，他那南瓜臉下的胖脖子也運帶哆嗦一下。瞧瞧道叫着的女子，方頭方腦的耳朶上吊着付耳環。「媽的！」他心里想。「湄的　道可不錯。還是昨天的事，拿着老婆一付舊耳環去出賣，吃得一肚子湄，回家老婆尋死覓活的給你鬧：一聲賊呀一聲老勿死，「怎麽連老娘最後一點財產也給偷去了！」媽媽的！這臭婆娘，全不知道現在銀子値錢。專有一種外國人，向咱們收銀貨：這時出貨，老子就得多喝一杯黃湯。——呵呵呵！這世界不叫老子喝黃湯過日又怎麽的？……」於是大個子口裏流下了一條饞涎，接着，又打了個噴嚏：「啊啋！」</p>
<p>「怎麽啦！」回過一個漂亮的女學生的臉：兩條眉毛灣灣的細細的畫着，粉頰上　着一大塊蠟黃的胭脂。她拉拉靠在一邊的西裝革履的男同學，裝個像受了別人欺侮的表情，說：「出去啦！出去啦！」可是那男子蓬着一頭長髮，從近視眼鏡透過去瞧那個瓢兒臉的女人，全像個畫家對着模特兒寫生似的瞧着，沒理會那女同學的催促。那女的生了氣，撅着她那張玲瓏的小嘴，在密擠着的腿林子里轉過屁股，一個勁兒擠了出來，彷彿私自在說：「你這個老賊！你在公園林子里，偷我的吻倒知道，你這回瞧得瓢兒臉出神，想來偷她的愛情了嗎？」</p>
<p>那個男的突然覺得左手邊謄出一個空隙，回頭瞧，一個島窠似的後腦勺，在人羣中向外移去。他也馬上在腿林子里轉身，一直綫的跟踪追上；全把肩坎左右的驚奇的臉子，耳朶旁邊「偷什麽呀？賊是那個？」這些聲音撇在一邊，兩眼緊瞧住那個島窠不放。一到門外人行道上，就拉住那女同學的左手臂，問道：「怎麽了？」</p>
<p>「怎麽了？」那女的把左嘴角向上一撅：「人家把噴嚏打在我後腦勺上你可理也不理啦！」但接着她由於那左手臂傳來的男子手把的暖和，她又轉回了心，生氣似地問了句：　倒底是偷了什麽啦？</p>
<p>「偷漢子也吧！偷東西也吧！管他鳥事！」那男子用溫存的口氣說。接着，他突然記起自已是個大學生，又加了一句：『便是咱們的土地，也給人偷去了幾千方里了！咱們也管不了，咱們還有心來管這個當小偷的！」說着，也就撥開行人道上成羣　着的人，向南挽臂走去了。</p>
<p>迎面來了個白帽邊的警察。他彷彿聽得些那個大學生的話，一到天成印刷所門口，他就揮着手在驅散羣衆，但他一邊還對羣衆說着，又像叫羣衆別走，聽他的說敎。</p>
<p>「那有什麽可有呢？賊巳經給抓去了。一個老板，兩夥計。——喏！喏！就是偷那家米店的米！」他說着，驅散羣衆的手却指在對馬路一家小家小米店。</p>
<p>羣衆里一個滿臉發油的瘦矮子，用油得起黑的飯單抹抹他的額角上突然驚出的汗。「米！米！唉！他媽的！米店老板的米就應該偷。咱們包飯店，吃虧的，就是他們高漲米價。要是——要是——我早知道他偷得了米，那麽，咱們同條馬路的，不是可來弄些便宜貨貨——</p>
<p>『偷了十一袋——偷了十一袋！」警察還一個勁兒說下去。他彷彿對於偷米這件事發生了興趣，他完全同情這賊的技術的超等，他說，「你們想，這馬路上，可不少咱們站崗的，他竟破了門，偷出了十一袋！這叫人聽了，全以為他跟咱們合在一起的！——唔！——咳！」說着，他突然慚愧地咳嗽起來。這時候，門內鬥外的人全都交流起來。知道是偷米的事的人，全都在心里起了些惋惜：「怎麽竟給破獲了呢？唉！要是我能分到一袋那可多好呵！」</p>
<p>「呵！那眞是個大賊呀！眞有本領。」馬上有人說起話米。言語之間，反顯出了稱讚。但他又覺得自已說話的不得體，於是加上批評。「媽的！不要臉的！還是個印刷所老板呢？」</p>
<p>「是呀！還是印刷所老板呢！」警察惶愧之餘，馬上來句改正。他這時站在羣衆的正中，顯示着自己是　捉賊的老手的神情。『要是專幹這　套的，那麽人家也許會說：呵！某馬路米店的失竊，那是這個賊跟警察老爺先打過招呼的。可是他是印刷所的老板呀！……』</p>
<p>「那麽，那麽——』一個小老太婆，仰起她那張表示「鞠躬盡瘁死而後已」的精神的臉子，萬分失望地問：「賊　抓到局裏去了！米呢？米到那裏去了！還在這……這…」她說着，兩隻爛壞了的眼睛就　麽也捨不掉似　瞧着那條擠滿着人的鬥。「唉！』她歎息着，「成天在路上要　　，也沒有一升米哪！」</p>
<p>人類的英雄們，却異口同附和那個警察的議論，且還讚美着：</p>
<p>「不錯呀！老鄕！你有本領！同在一條馬路，這麽的你偷我盜，那還了得。上海地面眞奇怪，做了老板還偷米！即使印刷生意沒人上門，那也好改做別的生意呀！——哼！」於是，鼻子裏放出一個無形的彈丸，彷彿給這個作賊的射中心胸，感了痛快。</p>
<p>「但，但——米店老板！唔！」那個包飯作的老板還不住地在抹額角，用低低的聲音說，』米店老板抬高米價！唔！唔！……」</p>
<p>「哪裏？哪裏？還要壓低穀價呢！」接着，有一隻嘴在包飯作老板的耳邊響。老板回頭瞧：是仁成煤炭店的伙計，黑臉黑手的全像個黑無常。「——我，我，去年還在鄕下種田！」</p>
<p>『媽的！」但老板還想他自己的：「便是你們家的柴爿！哼！」他用眼向他身上一撇，轉又看那人類中的英雄之英雄——警察老爺去：警察老爺還是一個勁兒演他的說。他要從每一張發驚的臉子上，看出稱讚的表情。</p>
<p>靑年的婦女們彷彿放下了一顆心，相互地瞧瞧，做做細眼，撅撅嘴，默默地交換着各人的意思，彷彿全都感到些高興；但也全都感到些欠缺。她們來不及看到那個作賊的臉貌。她們終於相互的問着：「怎麽樣一個人呢？濃眉大眼的？——但總有一條粗壯的臂膊吧！」有條粗壯的臂膊，那就是僩她們崇拜的英勇的男子。能背着十一袋米飛簷走壁的男子——這樣的一個男子是多麽可愛呵！她們又回過頭去，往門裏望。她們彷彿又在妒忌那個站在床前的瓢兒臉的男子。</p>
<p>「走吧！走吧！」警察還是舉起他那隻維持治安的手。『有什麽可看呢，賊也抓去了！贓也追去了！還有什麽可看呢——走吧！走吧！」於是一隻鷹爪似的鐵手，在羣衆的頭上飛　起來。羣衆還沒有想走的意思：你看着我，我看着你，兩脚老在原地上不住地踏着。</p>
<p>鷹爪似的鐵手翔過黃瘦的靑年作家的頭上，他歎息着說：</p>
<p>「倒底誰是賊呢？——誰記起了咱們的土地？誰記起了在咱們土地上磨老手脚的農民的汗血呢？……」</p>
<p>但他終於也偷了這個題材走了。</p>
<h3 id="c221">海岸上 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>—威海衛風景綫之一—</p>
<p>海風整夜的怒吼，寒冷在暴的在岸上激動着，掛在房簷下從夏天就晒乾了的黃魚干，被風撲着打在墻上，不斷的敲出巴啦巴啦的聲音。東鄰的驢子叫過以後，正打着酣睡的老母猪也叫起來，把着子伸到食槽上邊上擦癢，又跌到窩里呼啦呼啦的睡了。</p>
<p>鷄叫頭一遍鄰家欄里的馬就號叫起來，這工夫雙喜嫂就醒了。她輕輕的摸一下身邊的福兒，他睡得父香叉甜，她便把自己身上的被子往孩子身上拉一拉，給他蓋得嚴嚴實實，於是再翻身去推雙喜哥。</p>
<p>——起來，起來，天早亮啦！</p>
<p>雙喜哥嗯了兩聲，孩子似的懶瀨的翻轉身去，又呼呼的睡着了。</p>
<p>她知道雙喜哥整天受累，多睡一會兒並不是貪懶，他是應該洩洩身上的疲乏的，但是他的生活不能允許他休歇，孩子，老婆都要向他要飯吃，他一天不上海打魚，生活就會給他眼色看。所以她不得不二次去敲雙喜哥的脊梁了。他打過一陣哈欠就起身，揉了兩下糊了眼屎的眼皮，就忙着穿衣裳。最後他伸手到枕邊摸烟袋，雙喜嫂直咕嚕，嫌他起得太晚。任着老婆怎樣的嘮叨他默不作聲。抽了幾袋烟，看看窗紙上放出白光，就下炕去，在灶間東邊壁上摸索了半天才找到了昨天雙喜嫂剛補好的魚網。</p>
<p>稀稀落落的星辰，還在天上閃耀着，巷子是黑暗的，遠遠地在維新路口上的電燈，昏暗不明的像是被風寒嚇得失色了。他打着寒噤，踏着凍結實了的泥路，匆忙的走。菸袋鍋里的火光，不時的映閃出他的臉的一部分。污膩不堪，彷彿他下生一直到現在從沒有洗過臉。腥臭滿身，手手脚脚都有魚鹵的氣味。</p>
<p>走上維新路就跟黑暗分開了。馬車夫縮頭縮腦的坐在車前的位子上打盹，馬站穩四蹄背着風頭在嚼着嘴里的「溜子」。出路口就是中山馬路，崗警在街心踱來踱去。好像貓揪着他的耳朶似的。雙喜走　走着精神就上來啦，吹着口哨，一直往東碼頭走去。魚網的鉛墜子碰出叭啦叭啦的聲響。</p>
<p>風濤不斷的從海上撲過來。</p>
<p>遠遠的，英吉利的兵艦，閃着星星一般的燈光，浪濤叫吼着，漁夫的搖櫓聲，碼頭上人跟燈光　在一起，吵嚷得厲害。雙喜哥越走越發急，他想：</p>
<p>——姜升一定等得發火了？</p>
<p>走到東海飯店後身，打南邊過來一個水兵，還有一個女的，他見慣了，知道那是英國水兵和白俄舞女。女的在笑着，水兵像沒了脚根，東倒西歪的走近了雙喜哥，一股襲人的酒氣從水兵身上鑽進雙喜哥的鼻孔里。</p>
<p>那個水兵忽然獅子一般撲到雙喜哥身上，抓住就打，乍時雙喜哥不敢抵抗，直往後躲，可是那水兵宛如遇着仇敵，狠命的打個不住。雙喜哥，忍無可忍的猛力一膀子，那水兵卟哧一聲跌倒路邊的小水道里了。嘴里亂嚷，那個女人　　的笑着獨自走開了。</p>
<p>水兵亂喊亂叫，爬又爬不起，身子濺在污泥水里，雙喜哥見事不妙，拉腿就跑，後面警笛尖聲的叫起，當他跑到浴塲附近時，迎面給巡查的警長逮住：</p>
<p>—你跑什麽？</p>
<p>—我…我急着去打魚…</p>
<p>—怎麽你臉上有血？說實話，你幹嗎哩？</p>
<p>警察帶着那個水兵追上來。</p>
<p>—就是他—指着雙喜哥—他搶這位外國人！</p>
<p>雙喜哥被恐怖包圍着，渾身打哆嗦，嘴唇顫動着：</p>
<p>—他無故打我，難道不許我回手嗎？</p>
<p>警長用力的打了雙喜哥一個耳光：</p>
<p>—打你？人家英國人幹嗎打你！</p>
<p>—搜搜他搶了什麽？</p>
<p>—先　到局子去再說。</p>
<p>那個水兵給警長用馬車送到威海醫院去了。</p>
<p>雙喜哥被繩索綁着，拉到了公安局。</p>
<p>暴風越在肆的咆哮着，劉公島上的積雪白茫茫的映出了天上的凍雲。遙遠的東方，在水平綫上顯出一團紅光。太陽快出來了。英吉利的大兵艦，巍巍的矗立在海面上，吐着濃烟。碼頭上站滿了魚販，在遙望着歸來的漁船。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c222">阿國的最後抵抗 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>在强權的壓迫下，阿比西尼亞用血肉去抵抗意大利的槍彈，苦戰至七個月之久。現在阿軍雖然屢受重創，但是阿民却並不因此而屈伏。在外交方面，阿國在國聯，堅决拒絕意國所提出的苛酷條件，並要求將國聯盟的第十六條規定的制裁辦法，全部付諸實施。在軍事方面，阿軍刻正凖備作最後的抵抗。前日有民衆集於阿京跑馬塲，靜聆阿王諭文，命力能執戈的男子，集軍器子彈糧食，候令出發。當時有五千人，立卽宣布願作戰至死。一方阿國婦女，仍然勸吿男子，盡力抗拒意軍。阿國政府且發表一宣言，激勵人民，與其生爲意奴，不如死爲阿鬼。舉國同仇敵愾的决心，可見一斑。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的最後抵抗，將來成敗如何，現在是無從斷定的。依戰事的形勢觀察，前途大的是凶多吉少。但是我們以爲阿軍戰而勝，士氣必振，日後繼續奮鬥下去，收復失地，並不是絕對沒有希望。不幸戰而敗，也是光榮的。蓋被壓迫民族的解放鬥爭，本是很艱困的。阿國何嘗不明白自己力量的薄弱，經不起意軍精銳武器的一擊。然而爲被壓迫民族爭氣，也顧不得一切，只有拼死抵抗。阿國此舉，一方給予侵略國家以敎訓，他方也給予被壓迫民族以鼓勵。我們相信，將來一班野心家，若再肆無忌憚，一味向弱者侵略，必然會遭到强烈的抗拒。對於阿國的抗敵，許多人作議論，說勇敢是勇敢的，可惜太不量力，致有今日的慘敗。我們以爲這話是錯誤的。要知意大利之企圖吞併阿國，野心很大。阿國若不敢抵抗而屈伏，恐怕早已淪爲意國的奴隸。</p>
<p>東菲戰爭，又到重要關頭。阿國的最後抵抗，不只關係於一國的存亡，也足以决定全世界被壓迫民族的命運。</p>
<h3 id="c223">逃 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>冬天，西北風吹着禿幹的樹枝，呼呼作響，野狗不知躱到什麼地方去了，偶然從遠處飄來打更的聲音，鄕村之夜更顯得凄凉，恐怖。鄕下人都是特別會打算的，吃過晚飯，就吹熄了火，躱到破棉絮中去了。他們燒菜都捨不得多放菜油，他們是多末注意着油燈裏的油啊</p>
<p>天空沒有星星，沒有月亮，整個鄕村靜伏在黑暗的懷抱中，彷彿一隻受創的豺狠。不過東溝阿狗害着重病，母女兩個守候在病榻旁邊，壁上的那盞油燈還閃着一絲慘綠的荳光。病人張大了嘴，眼睛翻在頭角裏，微微打着呵欠，像睡着，又像死去的樣子。母女兩個，眼睛哭得胡桃一般紅腫，她們担憂着阿狗的病，更害怕明天早上就要到來的慘劇。她們緊緊地抱着，但是這所破屋子裏四面有箭一樣的寒風襲擊着，他們望望阿狗慘白的面容，又互相注意着，好像交換心中的苦痛似的。</p>
<p>梆子的聲音又從遠處飄來，是三更了，天亮就在眼前了呵。女兒終於偎着娘的水冷的面頰，悠悠地說：「媽，我們還是聽爸的話，天沒有亮的時候逃去罷。」</p>
<p>娘本能地把女兒抱得更緊一點，大家流着眼淚，從眼角沿着面頰，滴到身上，分不淸是那一個的。她從心的深處吐了口氣，「但是，月香，爸害着病怎樣好呢？」</p>
<p>她馬上又害怕驚醒了榻上的阿狗，從床沿的這端移到那一端，但是阿狗還像死去了那樣子的睡着。她用衣角拭着眼淚，接着說：</p>
<p>「這世界上眞沒有好人了！阿福那小鬼從前受了你爸多少好處，現在一交跌在靑雲裏，做了催租，就眼睛生在額角上，一點都不賣情面。……」她嗚咽着說不下去了。阿福的那付狗臉似乎已經站在她面前：</p>
<p>「哼！欠了租好不還，我阿福吃什麼來着！乾脆，月香這般大了，做胡大爺的姨太太遝辱沒了你們！明天打小轎來接，老頭子，你想想淸楚罷！」</p>
<p>他推了阿狗一掌，搖呵擺的走了。阿狗病了二個多月，今天阿福上門，免强從舖上直起背來，說了許多好話，已經接不上氣了，不提防阿福當胸一掌，就從床沿上滾下來，半嚮不開口，祇有胸脯有一絲氣息起伏着。</p>
<p>母女倆個急亂着手脚，打熱手巾，用土法刺脚底，等到阿狗醒來的時侯，他拼着全身的力量劈了老伴一個巴掌，喊着你這沒良心的猪狗！但是他馬上淸楚了，那個猪狗的東西早已奔回城裏在胡大爺的面前獻媚了。他看着妻子撫摩着被打了的面頰，他抱歉似的說：</p>
<p>「我早說過，死守着這幾畝田遲早是個餓死！你們聽我的話，還是逃去吧！我是不…中用…的了！」</p>
<p>母女倆個伏在床沿上哭着，阿狗恨恨地咬着牙根。</p>
<p>現在壁上的火光更小了，而且跳閃着，馬上耍熄滅的樣子。娘祇有流淚，嘆氣，她不能丟了害病的丈夫逃去，又不願意自己的骨肉送給那些狗東西。</p>
<p>阿狗突然醒來了，他還是大聲地喊着「逃啊！守着我有鳥用！」他努力想從鋪上掙扎起來，但是他的手一軟，人彷彿一件行李似的從床角摔了下來，嘴邊染着股紅的血——死了。</p>
<p>妻子整個身體撲到屍首身上，哭着，呌着……</p>
<p>女兒忽然像從夢中醒來似的喊起來：「媽，逃啊！」像爸的聲音一樣有力，「守着有鳥用！」</p>
<p>「但是你的爸呢？」娘想抱起阿狗的屍首。</p>
<p>「活着的再不能等死了！」她瘋在地收拾着東西，不知那裏來的氣力，拉着娘就走。</p>
<p>天色慢慢地亮了，空中飄着雨絲，他們踩着濘滑的泥路離開這村莊，但是遠處是一片迷霧……</p>
<h3 id="c224">太光明 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 沙楊枝</p>
<p>人的眼睛是貴乎看見光明，並且要看見偉大的光明。（因爲能見光明的人才有幸福，）</p>
<p>但是一個有目疾的人，他不但看不見光明了，並且他的眼前時常糢糊不淸，那麼他的幸福豈不是被剝削了嗎？</p>
<p>所以眼睛如果有病就應該妥爲療治，從前患目疾的多苦無良藥，自從五洲大藥房的明明眼藥水出品以後，就像是給患目疾的降生了一個救主，因爲它能鎭痛止癢，消炎退赤，收歛殺菌，專治各種眼病，它的效力凌駑乎一切類似品之上，</p>
<p>明明眼藥水可以使黑暗的眼睛重覩光明！</p>
<p>明明眼藥水可以使病痛的眼睛大放光明！</p>
<h3 id="c225">春天的痛苦 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 濟公</p>
<p>春天的日麗風和，桃紅柳綠。人們都要感到快樂。可是有些人也要感到痛苦！</p>
<p>在春天要感到痛苦的是那種人呢？你聽我說：</p>
<p>原來曾經患過花柳毒病的人，表面雖然痊愈，血中仍有餘毒，每到春天。就要突起爲患。近代雖盛行注射療法，也僅能殺菌，仍然要靠內服藥劑淸除血中的餘毒，不這樣做就難澈底痊愈！</p>
<p>我現在要表揚「海波藥」，因爲它能淸血解毒，是治療梅毒的內服專劑，對於各期梅毒和因血液不潔而起的皮膚病，都能根治，未發以前預先餌服，更能事半功倍，消滅隱患於無形，使春天感受這樣痛苦的人得到快樂。（按　海波藥山五洲大藥房發行。）</p>

<p>— 舒芒</p>
<p>於是，結束了少年的夢；以後的不幸福的多風雨的日子也就處之泰然了。勤勤懇懇的「像牛馬一樣」的在三太爺那裏做了十二年的長工，掙了點薄薄的田地，葬下了死去的父母與女人，便自痴一樣地生活下去了。然而，他是有希望的：希望有一天好的命運落到他底頭上，到那時，便什麽多順平起來了，「有田地，有錢，有好的日子……」</p>
<p>荒年，小夥子全浪到遠處的城市裏做工去了，年輕的「五阿爹」（那時候，人家只呌他「阿五」）卻依舊躲在鄕裏怨命，賣去了僅有的二畝多田地，之後，依舊做着他所甘心的「細工」。</p>
<p>於是，一年年地過去，人家的夥子從遠處的城市裏回來了。幾的勞作與掙取帶來了相當的錢財，於是，買了田，買了房子，把生活安定地建設起來了；他們去看了同年代的「阿五哥」，阿五哥已經是頭髮在日的五阿爹了。他依舊在困苦地耕作着，羨慕人家的「命運」，希望有一天好的命運會落到他底頭上來……</p>
<p>就是這樣的，輕飄地，浪費而不知不覺地，五阿爹的一生悲慘地過去了：而今，黃昏或淸早，孤寂的時候，他想起，好的命運也許永久不會來的了：等待了一生，希望了一生，然而，那結果卻是個「失敗」。</p>
<p>五阿爹想到了墳墓，想到了死—他不敢再想了。</p>
<p>他承認他是在生活中失敗了的一個。</p>
<h3 id="c227">船上 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>河水汨汨地流着，兩岸的燈火伴着黃昏的消失也零散的息滅了。橋頭邊掛着一盞暗紅的河燈，風輕輕地吮動它，紅色的光燄鬼火似的搖着，整個的原野是靜的，濃黑的夜氣迷霧般的展開，沿了小河的身子飄到大野里去，在碧凈的天空下，是一片媚人的靜夜。</p>
<p>橋洞的左邊，一隻黃划子船斜臥着，靠岸的船頭上搭着條寬大的跳板，一個漢子緩緩從村口走出來，他搖　着身子，邁過一段陷脚的沙灘，脚踏上跳板時，後艙的蓆棚里爬出個女人來，她手里捧着盞小的美孚燈，她立起身，燈光給河風吹得頭抖了兩下，那漢子也撞到面前了，女人重又矮下身爬進棚子去，便說：</p>
<p>「這末晚才回來，你看醉得那樣兒。」</p>
<p>那漢子沒說話，把一隻空糧食口袋塞到艙板底下，一翻身像團軟泥似的便躺倒了，昏昏地瞇着雙眼睛，納下頭便要沉睡過去的樣子，女人坐到他旁邊，推着那個漲紅的油漬漬的臉，問道：</p>
<p>「賣了多少錢哪，死猪，還沒有拌沙子哩，睡了怎辦？」</p>
<p>他想起拌沙子來，像淸醒了好多，糧店老闆的嘴臉向來是怕人的，他記得前决倫了一袋麥子賣了，待把糧食都從船里過到岸上去，鴻昌號查覺少了八斗，一聲不饗的呌兩個警察抓他到局子里，直待老婆把手下存的幾塊錢全交了，才放出他來，還沒給他一文船脚錢。</p>
<p>他展開五個指頭，吿訴那女人今天賣出這袋高梁的錢數，抽回臍膊來，抓起被頭邊的瓦壺，咕咕地喝了一陣，便忽忙的躥向前艙里去，那兒有一個傢伙睡得正香甜，他伏下去重重地打了一拳，那伙子抓緊被頭不淸楚的駡着：</p>
<p>「日你姐，喝足了猫尿，不弄娘們去，半夜三更打老子幹啥？」</p>
<p>「嘿起來，咱還沒拌沙子哪！明天又看巡警來抓人的熱鬧呵，我呌他們抓你！」</p>
<p>這個睡得瞇瞇糊糊的傢伙坐了起來，披上衣服，使大拳頭揉着眼睛說：</p>
<p>「橫豎咱沒偷，咱也不犯法，你他媽還有該送公安局！」</p>
<p>「你分不分錢？要不分出了岔都是我的，……」</p>
<p>兩個人一邊互相駡着。就一前一後的順着跳板走下船來，每人揣着一隻洋鐵　箕，在沙灘上剷滿了沙子，再揣着爬回船上，倒進那裝滿了高粱的池艙里，等每個人運了五次，同回到船上抓着一隻小木板，跳進高梁艙中，盡力的把沙粒播散開，使它和高梁混絞的分不淸了，重把放在艙蓋上的那三袋高梁薄薄的撒到表面上，一切收拾妥當了。伙計倆使手抹着汗珠，並肩的蹲到小河岸上洗了臉，醉酒的漢子拐回後艙里抱着那女人睡了。另一個坐在船頭上，寂寞的含着烟管，火光在夜蔭中一閃閃地亮着紅光，他聽慣了這小河上悠然的水聲，他也看熟了這寗靜的夜，什麽也是照舊的。那抱了女人睡的漢子，打着很嚮的鼾聲，他想到那是快樂的，幸福的，尤其在這春天的晚間，最後他想到他伙計偷的那袋高糧來，明天要分錢了，拿到錢，傍晚跑到鎭上去，找個「半掩門」陲她一夜不也是快活的嗎？……</p>
<p>仰頭看了下天，三星斜斜地掛在靑空上，他扣了烟灰，便又重爬進艙里躺下了。</p>

<p>阿根和阿毛只是向人堆亂竄。</p>
<p>兩個十一二歲的孩子穿着單褂，還是漲紅着臉，終究是三月底了，又是孩子愛熱鬧。阿根額上豆大的汗珠在流，不是用袖口去揩着，袖口就是油膩得可以，阿毛也是揩着，揩的不是汗是鼻涕。</p>
<p>那條大街上人愈聚愈多，大家望着城外，娘兒們靠着沿街的窗口，有的站在商店的門口，店裏的人也是伸長了頭頸，不做賣買。站在路口的甘蔗攤忙着刷皮，還有成串的　光荸薺，自嫩地誘動趕熱鬧口渴的看會人。</p>
<p>「來了，來了」！</p>
<p>人騷動起來，其實什麽也沒有，大家耐心着。時常拉住一個熟識的過路人。「會離開那裏有多少遠」，「來了，快來了」回答大都是那樣的。</p>
<p>阿根和阿毛是人小的不是，擠到一個轉角的好地方，只是身子矮仰起頭提起脚尖，還是看見別人闊厚的背部，焦急着四處竄，猪肝樣的紅臉上，有鼻涕還有汗。</p>
<p>轉角那家米舖的短欄干裏早已站着許多人伸長頭頸的人，阿根便上爬去坐着，阿毛也學若阿根的樣。於是他們倆坐在短欄干上非常神氣的等着。</p>
<p>「會來了，會來了」！又是一片噪鬧。</p>
<p>差不多等了三里路程的時候。</p>
<p>「　！　！」遠遠地鑼聲震盪着一條街。</p>
<p>慢慢地導路的小旗用勁的揮着開一條路，遠遠地一面大　的頂尖，聲音一步近一步。</p>
<p>「那會才眞的來了呢」阿根說。</p>
<p>阿毛的小眼睛轉一會，點點頭，一面嚼着瓜子，一面小心地緊握着短欄干的橫檔。（未完）</p>

<p>生活好比一條渾濁的污泥河，向着不知什麽地方又平又慢地流着。機器吃乾了我們的筋肉，煤烟塗黑了我們的嘴臉，火酒燒焦了我們的心窩，酒后引起鬱結在心裏的恨，找不出洩恨的地方無奈何。每一天都看見父親打他們底兒子，丈夫敲他們底老婆，要不然就抱起窰姐兒跳個兒舞吧！或是提起手風琴唱個甜心兒歌：</p>

<p>王獻齋，在我們的　象當中，他實在是一個壞蛋，原因當然是因為他演的角色多屬於「反」的　「派」，存在於我們腦幕上的王獻齋的可怕的影象，其實旅遊是他一種演技的成功的明證，但是「新舊上海」中他並不是以前那樣刁險得駭人了，他是成為了一個「死要面子」的有趣的典型上海人，是帶給了你無限的笑意了。</p>

<p>魯思已由日返國，（小住些時候據說還將到日本去。）昨天在上海大戲院試「人間地獄」時出現，熟識者都很驚奇地問：「你什麽時候回來的？」他他淡淡地說，一個多月了，一向在鄕下，到上海還沒有幾天呢。」</p>
<p>「人間地獄」很暴露了些監獄的黑暗情形，使人看了頗為感動，不過裏面有類似「亡命者」及「怒潮」處，　又未有「亡命者」及「怒潮」那樣沉着有力。戲的本身不能算錯，幾個對比也甚為有力，全片間有使人覺得突然的地方，不知是被剪還是原來如此？</p>
<p>有如此一說：南京中國舞台協會的「復活」，本來是想請一位留法的女音樂家主演的，但是因為她不是「明星」怕公演的時候不會有多少號召力，所以决定叫胡萍來主演了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Passing of the Central Standing Committee: Report on the Deliberation of the Draft Constitution; Legislative Yuan to Begin Reviewing Today; Quota of Representatives from the Four Northeastern Provinces to the National Assembly to be Combined and Allocated with the Quota of Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee convened its tenth plenary session at 9 a.m. on the 23rd. Those present included Ye Chucang, Ding Weifen, Kong Xiangxi, Feng Yuxiang, Lin Sen, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Zhang Lisheng, Zhou Fo Hai, Zhou Qigang, and more than twenty others. Ding Weifen presided over the meeting, which adjourned at noon. Regarding the report of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee and opinions on the review of the constitutional draft, a resolution was passed to submit it to the Legislative Yuan. Furthermore, concerning the quota of representatives from the four northeastern provinces to the National Assembly, it was resolved that it should be combined and allocated with the quota of representatives from various provinces and cities. Committee Member Yu Youren was also nominated to deliver a report at next week's memorial service. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The report on the deliberation of the constitutional draft, passed by the Central Standing Committee on the 23rd, may be sent to the Legislative Yuan for article collation on the evening of the 23rd or the morning of the 24th. The Legislative Yuan session on the 24th was unable to present it for review. It is reported that the Legislative Yuan has already planned to assign several Legislative Committee chairmen, secretaries-general, and legislators with expertise in constitutional law to be responsible for the review immediately after it is presented to the Yuan. If time permits, the review committee members plan to convene a meeting on the afternoon of the 24th to begin the review. It is expected to be completed in a short period and submitted to the next week's Yuan session for review, after which it can be presented to the National Government for promulgation on May 5th as scheduled. As for the content of the constitutional draft review report passed by the Central Committee, it has been learned that it does not differ much from what was reported by this newspaper in its telegram on the 20th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member spoke about the meaning of the decision to combine and allocate the quota of representatives from the four northeastern provinces to the National Assembly with the quota of representatives from various provinces and cities. It means that the quota for the four northeastern provinces will be the same as other provinces, proportional to the population. In other words, the Northeast will elect a certain number of representatives based on its population. Due to the circumstances in the four northeastern provinces, the people cannot directly exercise their right to vote, and appropriate measures will be taken to remedy this. These are currently under study. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Appointment of Wang Fu and Others to Compile Party History</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In addition to discussing the constitutional draft, the Central Standing Committee on the 23rd also approved the appointment of Wang Fu, Yao Yuping, Yang Pusheng, Zhou Zhongliang, Zhang Mojun, Di Ying, Wang Yongbin, Chen Zhaoqi, Lu Zhiyi, Yang Xiji, Li Xiaoniu, Li Wuding, Yu Peidi, Qin Yuliu, Shen Li, Zhao Dingming, Guo Yingfu, Ling Yue, Zai Dong, Lu Zhonglin, Liu Guanxun, Zhu Hezhong, Zhang Yongfu, Gu Ziyang, and Liu Jixue, a total of 25 people, as honorary compilers of the Party History Compilation Committee. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Draft Organizational Law Discussed in the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The special committee of the Legislative Yuan has completed the draft of the National Assembly Organization Law and plans to present it to the Yuan session on the morning of the 24th for discussion. The law consists of twenty articles, most of which, in addition to being made according to the principles set by the Central Committee, are generally based on the National Assembly Organization Law. The main points are as follows: Representatives shall take an oath at the opening ceremony; the method of voting shall be determined by the chairman at their discretion; a secretariat and a police affairs office shall be established under the secretary-general; those present shall not be held responsible for statements and votes made at the meeting; the power to interpret the Organization Law belongs to the National Government; and the date of implementation shall be determined by order. As for the draft election law, it will be submitted to the Yuan session for discussion after the quota of representatives is researched and the draft is completed next week.

<p>(Chengdu) Chairman Chiang telegraphed Liu Xiang on the 23rd, stating that conscription for road construction should focus on utilizing slack farming seasons. Now that it is the busy spring farming season, except for the Sichuan-Hunan Road project, all other roads will be allowed to suspend conscription for one month from now. Conscription will resume after the busy farming season. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Chairman Chiang ordered all roads in Sichuan (except the Sichuan-Hunan Road) to suspend conscription of civilian labor for one month due to the farming season. However, the Sichuan-Kang Road is of great importance to the suppression of bandits, so the policy of military labor for road construction will be adopted, and it must be completed within three months. The funds for the road will come from Ya'an, through Luting, to Kangding. The labor camp has been organized and will be officially established in Ya'an within days. The survey team is scheduled to depart on the 26th, and the road construction troops will be Xue Yue and Liu Wenhui's units. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e19">A Review of Arita's Diplomacy <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Since Hachiro Arita was transferred from Ambassador to China to Japanese Foreign Minister, his diplomatic blueprint has been manifested in facts. These include the rectification of the diplomatic lineup, the personnel transfers that broke diplomatic precedents, and the establishment of a regular weekly consultation meeting among the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs ministries. The goals he has set are, first, the unification of national defense and diplomacy, and second, the activation of planning based on established practices. In recent weeks, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been soliciting opinions from various parties to determine its new diplomatic policy, focusing on two fundamental issues: rescuing East Asia from the so-called threat of communism and opening up new avenues for Japanese commercial and economic activity. Although the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech in the Diet on the 19th was lengthy, we believe that these two points are at the center of his policy implementation. Thus, it is already clear that Arita's diplomacy differs from Hirota's in terms of operational methods and procedures.</p>
<p>If we try to analyze Arita's current diplomacy, we can gain a clear understanding. He places emphasis on a policy toward the Soviet Union while building a good foundation for relations with China and Britain. The key to this is the so-called anti-communist issue, which is also the preliminary manifestation of the application of the so-called three principles. Secondly, under the self-assumed mission of being the "watchdog of the East," he employs a strategy of conciliation to avoid increasing the antipathy of the United States and Britain. The purpose is to seek the support of the United States and Britain through enticement, to have them recognize Japan's special position in East Asia, to explore the coordination of interests in China between Britain, Japan, and the United States, and then to discuss the redrawing of the world market. We can call this policy the application of the East Asian monopoly policy. It is not as reliant on force as the diplomacy of the military, nor as rigidly formal as the diplomacy of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Therefore, the characteristic of Arita's diplomacy is that it is based on so-called application, and its lineup is built on the consistent attitude of the four ministries of Foreign Affairs, Navy, Army, and Finance. This trend is a new transformation in Japanese diplomacy. If we look at the recent appointment of Kawagoe, the Consul-General in Tianjin, as ambassador to China, and the rumors of Koki Hirota's mission to Russia, we can see that these personnel changes have been decided under this policy. The progress of its future is noteworthy for us: the delicate and turbulent Anglo-Japanese relations, the evolution of so-called unified diplomacy, and the changing real situation on the East Asian continent. All of these are sufficient to affect Arita's entire foreign policy.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the future of Sino-Japanese relations does not allow us to be overly optimistic. Japan has rectified its lineup and aligned its steps to deal with us. How will our country respond? This is what the people of our country should be vigilant about after reviewing Arita's diplomatic policy.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) A person in charge of the Finance Department said on the 23rd that Director Cheng has arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and is currently conducting preliminary negotiations with banks for loans. He plans to use the new government bonds as collateral. If the loan can be established recently, the Finance Department may first issue pre-sale certificates for the new government bonds to cope with the situation. However, there are no such plans at present. The issue date of the new government bonds was originally set for May 1, but the exact date still needs to be determined after the Legislative Yuan reviews and approves it.

<h3 id="e22">Panchen Lama's Advisor Returns to America to Talk About Tibetan Construction Plans; Road Construction and Establishment of Hydroelectric Power Plants are Urgent; Air Transportation Planned Between Lhasa and Shanghai <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Nicholas Roerich, an American writer currently serving as an advisor to the Dalai Lama, told Reuters that air traffic between Shanghai and Lhasa may soon be realized. The Dalai Lama passed away two years ago, and the Panchen Lama hopes to succeed his legacy. He is paying close attention to the development of air transport in his country and plans to establish weekly air services between Lhasa and the coast, either in China or in India, one of the two. According to public opinion, the first air transport service will adopt the route between Lhasa and Shanghai, but flights to India are not impossible, and for various reasons, they are also more important commercially. Roerich's visit to the United States is related to this plan. He will choose the most suitable aircraft. It is heard that after the establishment of air transport in the future, the main product transported will be gold ore produced in Tibet. Roerich also said that the Panchen Lama has carefully formulated a plan for the modernization of Tibet, but this should not be interpreted as opening up Tibet for foreigners to travel or exploit. The Panchen Lama currently considers the establishment of hydroelectric power plants and radio stations, and the construction of roads, as urgent matters. However, he will not seek foreign investment to organize these, but will purchase what he needs on the market with existing funds, and use the export of gold as the necessary capital. Tibetan-Indian relations, under the Panchen Lama's rule, will definitely satisfy both parties. The Panchen Lama does not want to find other ways to seek closer relations with India, but he traveled to India 25 years ago, and in the past decade, he has had good contact with British diplomats in China, so he trusts the sincerity of British diplomats. Roerich mentioned the Constant Mountain expedition, saying that the Panchen Lama does not sympathize with this move to climb the highest peak. If such a determined expedition yields no results, the Tibetan government may not allow people to continue to make expeditions. The Panchen Lama believes that such scientific efforts are a waste of good time, money, and manpower. Roerich plans to return to Tibet via this degree in June. He has lived in the Far East for many years and has served the Panchen Lama for four years. (Reuters telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Washington) Members of the Chinese banking delegation declared today that Finance Minister Maogen Tao did not mention the issue of China borrowing money from the United States during his talks with the delegation. The discussion proceeded in a harmonious manner, but it has not yet reached the stage of releasing the content. Most of the materials discussed were statistical data. Guo Bingwen, director of the Chinese International Trade Bureau, said when discussing his work here that he is studying many reports and materials, but has not yet reached a conclusion. Guo denied reports that he is negotiating the purchase of American railway materials, saying that if there were such a thing, it should be handled by the Chinese Ministry of Railways.

<p>(London) The Times commented today on the statement made by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, in Shanghai, saying that the new currency system in China could be successfully implemented. If this prediction is realized, China will have made a major step towards the expansion of economic activities and the improvement of living standards. If Chinese finances had been managed properly earlier, there would have been no shortage of funds for developing China. The most beneficial thing for peace and economic development in the East is to seek agreements on China's economic transformation and progress. Some of the things that Chairman Frederick Eder of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation said at the general meeting were quite exciting. The newspapers all paid attention to Eder's remarks on the financial outlook. The Manchester Guardian reported that reports from all sides said that the Chinese government's replacement of the silver standard, which has been used since ancient times, with a managed currency is now quite effective. The Daily Telegraph said that the first thing the Chinese government should consider is how to balance the budget and reduce expenditures. The Morning Post said that when we think of the unfavorable circumstances such as the Sino-Japanese conflict and China's other internal difficulties, we cannot help but be surprised that commerce has not been greatly affected. Eder's remarks, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's statement, and the rumor that the Chinese government will soon announce a plan to clear the debts of the railways, as Liverpool did, have created a significant demand for Chinese railway bonds, which have not shown any signs of fatigue. Chinese customs and salt tax bonds are also strong. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Improvement of Chinese Silk Industry Draws Attention from Japanese, Exports Expected to Surge This Year, Surpassing Japan Within a Decade <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Nishimura, a Shanghai-based employee of the Central Sericultural Association, recently returned to Japan from Shanghai. On the 22nd, he attended a meeting of the Central Association and reported on the current state of the Chinese silk industry and his observations on its future. Nishimura stated that if the climate in Zhejiang and Jiangsu is favorable, the output of improved silkworm breeds this year could increase by 70% compared to last year, while the output of existing breeds could increase by 20%. Averaging the two, an overall increase of 50% can be expected. However, due to insufficient domestic demand, the increased output will need to find export markets. Therefore, it is generally predicted that Chinese silk exports this year will increase by 60,000 bales compared to last year. The impact on Japan's raw silk trade will be significant. Furthermore, provincial governments are establishing complete state-run silkworm breeding improvement centers to research improvement initiatives, prohibiting brokers from mediating direct transactions between silk producers and farmers, and purchasing surplus silkworm eggs. With such measures by provincial governments and the decline in silver prices, Chinese silk exports will undoubtedly surpass Japan's within the next decade. (23rd, Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The trial for the assassination attempt on Wang Jingwei was opened on the 22nd. However, as the case files were not yet complete, it was announced that the trial would be adjourned and resumed at a later date. The court is currently focused on obtaining the case files. However, a portion of the files, pertaining to the extradition of the arrested suspects in Hong Kong, has been sent to Hong Kong, and it is feared that it will not be possible to obtain them in a short period of time. Therefore, the court hearing had to be slightly delayed. After consideration by the presiding judge, the resumption of the trial has been scheduled for June 8th. As a result, Judge Wu Yuheng and others, who were to come to Nanjing to hear the case, will return to Suzhou on the 24th due to their busy schedules at the original court. Subsequently, the case files will be forwarded by the Capital District Court. (23rd, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The preliminary hearing for the four suspects in the assassination attempt on Wang Jingwei has been adjourned again, as the defendants' lawyers require another eight or nine days to translate the documents.

He will be interrogated separately tomorrow. (23rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>Cutting Off Transportation to Stop Italian Advance, Afghan Queen Tearfully Appeals to the World for Justice</p>
<p>(Afghan Capital) It is heard that fierce battles are currently taking place in Shulumida, 120 miles from the capital. The Afghan King's army is fighting to the death to resist the Italian army and prevent it from advancing towards the capital. According to today's news, the Afghan government has decided not to leave the capital. (23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Afghan Capital) The government has officially denied foreign reports that the King has abdicated the throne in favor of the Crown Prince, stating that the King still holds military and political power and will resist to the end even if the capital falls. Where the capital will be moved at that time is not being considered. (23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Afghan Capital) When interviewed by a Reuters correspondent today, the Afghan Queen passionately appealed to the world's newspapers to advocate for justice for Afghanistan, with tears in her eyes. The Queen said that this is the most critical time in Abyssinian history, but she hopes that justice will prevail to end this most unjust war and most heinous aggression against an independent and non-aggressive nation. It is still possible to do so. All those who value the principles of adjusting relations between nations must be ashamed and indignant at the unfair and unequal treatment suffered by Abyssinia. Abyssinia has not been defeated, and the entire nation is willing to uphold its just cause to the end. She herself intends to remain in the capital. The Queen appealed to France as a symbol of freedom and equality, and to Britain as a defender of the freedom and justice of all nations, and appealed to the world to quickly rise up to save the suffering nation of Abyssinia, without further delay. (22nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Afghan Capital) The Afghan Crown Prince returned to the capital today to help organize the defense of the city. His guards fought fiercely with the enemy all day yesterday in Waraha Lu, repelling numerous determined enemy attacks and inflicting heavy casualties. At night, they attacked the Italian rear guard along a winding path on the edge of a steep mountain. The Italian army was caught off guard and fled in disarray, abandoning a radio telegraph machine and many rifles. The Afghan army also defeated the Italian army, which had repeatedly tried to attack, on Mount Tagamir. The mountain is traversed by a winding path from Taixi to the capital. The Italian army was defeated three times, suffering heavy casualties, and finally stopped attacking. At the same time, hundreds of Afghans were engaged yesterday in blowing up the highway from Taixi to the mountain pass of Shulumida, more than a hundred miles from the capital. Although Italian aircraft constantly tried to prevent this operation from the air, transportation between Taixi and the capital was eventually severed by the Afghans, and mountain streams in several places were diverted to destroy the road. (23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Afghan Capital) Thousands of Afghan troops concentrated on the Sulameda Plain today, which will be the final battlefield for the capture of the capital. The troops are currently busy deploying machine guns in strategic locations in the mountain passes of Tai Mabura. Others, under the cover of rain and fog, blew up the road from Taixi to the capital to block the advance of General Badoglio's troops. Still other soldiers engaged in fierce battles with the Italian army between the mountain passes and the plains. The Crown Prince arrived here today, confirming that reports that he would go to Taixi to negotiate peace were inaccurate. An Associated Press reporter stationed in Jihuaxi at the base of the Tai Mabura mountain pass witnessed the destruction of the road and saw 1,500 soldiers digging trenches twelve feet deep to block the advance of Italian tanks and cars. Other soldiers used explosives to change the course of the river. There are conflicting reports about how far the Italian army has advanced, and the situation is very chaotic. The Afghan Queen recently went to the Akki radio station to ask the world's countries to allow England and France to quickly assist Abyssinia at this critical moment. She also refuted rumors that she would flee, saying, "I will defend to the death with my subjects. We have not completely failed yet." Refugees fleeing to the deep mountains outside the city are streaming endlessly, while the conscription efforts led by the Crown Prince are now very active. (22nd, National News Agency)</p>

<p>(Afghan Capital) The Afghan Queen recently gave a speech to representatives of the British and French press, saying, "France is the representative of the three great principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and the United States is the guarantor of freedom and justice. I appeal to the two countries, and to all nations of the world, to take swift action to save our country and resist the aggressor. I am deeply saddened to learn that some member states of the League of Nations have objected to strengthening sanctions." The Queen then severely criticized Italian policy, saying that defending the country has now entered the most intense stage and that she will share the hardships of her people. (22nd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Italian army on the southern front defeated General Nasibu's troops in Jinakobi, Woga Dan Province, they have now divided their forces into three routes and are advancing. Their destination is Sasabana, Afghanistan. The Afghan army has dug trenches in the area and seems to be resisting stubbornly. General Fulochi's corps, starting from Gorahai, has crossed Gabro Hall and is only a few tens of kilometers from Sasabana, forming the central route. General Navara, leading the Libyan Division and the Somali Rapid Response Team, has crossed Xigage, forming the left route. General Agostini, leading a motorized corps, has departed from Jelagobi and arrived at Gulati, forming the right route. The three routes are advancing in a magnificent manner. However, the southern front is currently experiencing heavy rains, and the roads are muddy, making travel difficult. All trucks and armored vehicles are having difficulty advancing. (22nd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to the latest news from Italian East Africa, the entire southern front of Afghanistan is experiencing storms, and wireless communications have been disrupted. Aircraft are unable to take off, and trucks and armored vehicles are extremely difficult to advance. However, the troops under the command of General Graziani, the commander-in-chief of the Italian army, are still advancing step by step on the front lines. General Farna's corps is pursuing the Afghan army, forcing them to retreat to the Dagaledo area, and dividing them into two groups. One group has retreated to Dagapo. (23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, the High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, recently issued a communiqué stating that General Farna's corps of the Italian army on the southern front is advancing along the Erfuite camel caravan route and has intercepted 600 camels and a batch of supplies intended for use in General Abey Bai's defense area. In addition, several trucks carrying medical supplies have been intercepted. Another corps has reached Xihoke in the Dafa Valley, and another corps has reached Gulati in Borana Province. The Italian air force bombed enemy outposts in Somaliland. There is no news to report from the northern front. (23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Italian-Afghan war, the government's official newspaper, Il Popolo di Roma, recently published a commentary stating, "Although this war can be won decisively in a short period of time, it is a misconception for the world to believe that the roads from Taixi to the Afghan capital are unobstructed. We must correct this. People in general overestimate the importance of the Italian-Afghan dispute. In fact, there are other issues more serious and threatening to the whole world than the Italian-Afghan dispute. Some say that after Italy's victory in Afghanistan, the prestige of some countries will be swept away and the League of Nations will collapse. This is nonsense. Since no European country has declared war on Italy, the League of Nations is not dealing with the issue of the victory or defeat of a civilized country. Italy's victory is the victory of truth and justice. How can it be related to the prestige of European civilized countries?" (23rd, Havas)</p>

<p>Jerusalem After a relatively quiet day in Palestine, serious riots broke out again yesterday between Jews and Arabs in Jaffa, wounding 14 Arabs and 5 Jews. Arabs in Jerusalem attempted to force a strike, resulting in a conflict in which several people were injured. Many Arab pickets were arrested before order was restored. Since the conflict between the two communities broke out on April 19, 16 Jews have been killed and 26 injured, and 5 Arabs have been killed and 31 injured. Many Jewish families in Hebron have moved to Jerusalem today to prevent further riots. It is recalled that Jews in the area suffered great losses during the 1929 conflict between the two communities. Arab leaders, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, have reportedly decided to postpone the departure of the Arab delegation to London to discuss the new legislative council and plan to implement a general strike in Palestine. At the same time, British troops remain on alert, but so far the police have been able to maintain order. (22nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>De Lai Weifu Our correspondent reports that the residences of all Jews scattered in the port of Jaffa were set on fire again by Arabs last night. The Jewish residents of the area have all come to the city of De Lai Weifu for refuge. De Lai Weifu City is located a few kilometers from the port of Jaffa and is the center of Palestinian Jewish activity. Since German leader Hitler implemented anti-Jewish movements, Jews in the country have moved to Palestine, and De Lai Weifu City has become more and more developed. Recently, refugees from places such as the port of Jaffa have arrived here, numbering 5,000. Local hospitals are overcrowded, and local authorities plan to set up reception centers in the suburbs to accommodate them, and encourage the public to donate money, food, and clothing to jointly participate in charitable activities.

<h3 id="e54">U.S. Government Tax Bill to Become a Key Point of Contention in the Presidential Election <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's new tax bill has today become the center of fierce debate in Congress and may expand to become a point of contention in the presidential election. Despite the President's warning that the bill must balance the government's current budget, leaders of the ruling party still insist on their opinions. The Republican side criticizes it as "a foolish experiment and a superficial gesture." It is reported that the President held a secret meeting with congressional leaders yesterday, solemnly declaring that the plan proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee will fall short of the minimum budget of $345,000,000 for the next three years. As for the amount of tax revenue that the bill can actually collect, opinions vary. The head of the Internal Revenue Service, Helvering, said that it would probably collect $792,000,000 in the first year. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Doughton, estimated that it would collect $800,000,000 to $840,000,000. The chairman of the Tax Rules Subcommittee, Hill, said that it could collect $700,000,000 to $800,000,000. The President's plan requires $792,000,000 annually for the first three years and $62,000,000 annually thereafter. Doughton claimed that there was no criticism from the White House at present, but the government might think that there should be more revenue. Republican members of the Finance Committee have submitted a minority opinion report, stating that the bill may become a major point of contention in the election, and said that they had no opportunity to study it before the bill was proposed. They are determined to oppose all new taxes until government waste of public funds ceases. Moreover, the bill is already stable in principle, and its implementation will further damage the security of the business community, because the purpose of the bill is not to collect taxes, but another experiment of the New Deal. Now the national debt is increasing by hundreds of millions every year without end, and the government budget does not consider balance. Federal credit is inflated to the extreme, so such experiments are dangerous, they said. The majority opinion report, also published today, acknowledges that it will fall short of the President's needs by $334,000,000 over three years, but claims that this amount can be studied in detail in the next Congress, and that the first year's income will exceed the President's budget by $10,000,000 because the business tax stipulated in the Agricultural Adjustment Act will be re-levied. However, this income will be greatly reduced in the second and third years. As for the corporate gross profit tax, it can eliminate the biggest shortcomings of the existing tax laws, because this tax can prevent people from accumulating their income in companies to evade taxes, and can eliminate the inequality in taxation between corporate partnerships and individual businesses in the business community, and all shareholders in the company, large and small, can be treated equally, it is said.

<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, visited Foreign Minister Arita at 1:00 PM today. According to instructions from his government, he proposed the following new suggestions regarding the border issue, requesting agreement: The Soviet Union is willing to concede on the authority of the border demarcation committee, limiting it to surveying the Soviet "Manchurian" border, not including the Mongolian "Manchurian" aspect, but the border dispute resolution committee still hopes to have the authority to handle disputes on the entire border line of the Soviet "Manchurian" Mongolian "Manchurian" border, so that all disputes can be resolved quickly. Arita replied that Japan has always insisted on starting the border demarcation from the eastern border, where disputes occur frequently, and cannot change this previous claim. However, if it is limited to the eastern border, it can agree to the simultaneous establishment of the above two committees. Yurenev then said he would reply after consulting his government. The meeting lasted a quarter of an hour. (Hualian Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>(London) Representatives of the General Staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium held talks here on the 15th of this month, and achieved good results. According to reliable sources, the measures agreed upon by the three General Staffs include the following: The French army is solely responsible for defending the "Maginot" Line on the eastern border of the country. (Maginot was the former French Minister of War; the defense line was completed during his tenure, hence the name Maginot Line.) It cannot spare troops to assist in the defense of neighboring countries, so the defense of Belgium should be assisted by British troops. When necessary, the defense of the Netherlands will also be assisted by British troops. France provides one airfield and Belgium provides two airfields for the British Air Force to use as bases. A military highway is built between France and Belgium to facilitate communication between the two countries' troops. This highway starts from the northeast of France and goes directly to the east of Belgium. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The National Defense Force held a review on Hitler's birthday yesterday, the 20th of this month. After visiting, foreign military experts all said that the equipment equipped by the German army is extremely sophisticated. The most sophisticated unit is the "Armored Division". The serial number carried by this "Armored Division" is the 5th Division. The total number of divisions is not known to the outside world. Foreign military experts also said that this "Armored Division" has the most fierce offensive power and can act quickly on a vast battlefield. Each division is equipped with two regiments of extremely fast tanks for charging. Each tank is equipped with two machine guns and carries two gunners. The vehicle driven by the commander is also equipped with a wireless motor to prepare for transmitting orders. During a recent exercise in the Silesian province, a colonel drove a vehicle, broke through the enemy's defense line, penetrated deep into the rear, and issued orders to his regiment from the vehicle using wireless electricity, which eventually led to victory. He was commended by the supervisor in charge. In addition to being equipped with tanks, this armored division is also attached with a reconnaissance team, whose members ride on motorcycles, which are equipped with machine guns, and can act quickly in the wilderness. In addition, there is also a regiment of machine gun armored vehicles and machine rapid-fire gun vehicles, which are driven by six-wheeled vehicles and can move freely regardless of the terrain.

<h3 id="e60">Baldwin Cabinet Still Shows Signs of Shaking; Opposition Party Criticizes Budget <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(London) Although the government's decision to propose the 1936-37 budget was passed by the House of Commons, the opposition strongly criticized it. According to general observations in political circles, Prime Minister Baldwin's position has been shaken as a result. Generally, the opposition's reasons are that the national defense expenditures listed in the budget are claimed to be used to strengthen the collective security organization, but in the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, the Cabinet's tendency to deviate from the League of Nations is becoming increasingly obvious, and it has not achieved anything in terms of international arms limitation, so its words and actions do not match, and it cannot stay in its position for long, etc. Hearing these criticisms, in order to restore the hearts of the people and revive his prestige, the Prime Minister may advise his ministers to tighten sanctions against Italy, and the timing is urgent and must be done. However, most cabinet members advocate that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute should be resolved quickly, so that Britain can withdraw its Mediterranean fleet and use its full strength to deal with the situation in Europe. This view does not coincide with the Prime Minister's view. If this view prevails, the Prime Minister's position will inevitably become more precarious. According to the Prime Minister's original intention, he wanted to continue to serve until King Edward VIII's coronation in May next year, and then retire. The Prime Minister will be seventy years old at that time, and his political career will come to a perfect end, so he will have no regrets. However, he has always supported the policy of collective security organizations. If he abandons his views halfway, the situation will naturally not allow him to continue to serve until next year. Therefore, it is generally predicted that the Prime Minister, in this dilemma, may make some changes and adopt the views of most cabinet members. What are the views of most cabinet members? That is, the responsibility of the League of Nations should be limited to handling European affairs, in other words, the collective security organization should only be limited to Europe. Regarding this, a Labor Member of Parliament said, "Baldwin, because the boat he is riding is in danger of capsizing, has prepared to jump on another boat" so that the life of the National Government can be extended for another year. However, according to some people in the political arena, it is said that the Prime Minister will be forced to retire within six months, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain, will succeed as the leader of the Conservative Party and succeed as Chairman.

<p>Only Allowed to Carry Out Cultural and Sports Propaganda; Communist Youth League Congress Closes</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Communist Youth League was originally political in nature. The Central Committee of the Party recently decided to reorganize it in order to unify its powers, allowing it only to engage in official propaganda activities in culture and sports and to participate in military training, but not allowing it to engage in political activities. This reorganization plan was submitted to the 10th Congress of the Youth League for discussion, and has recently been passed. In the future, the League will no longer be able to attend the Third International Congress and participate in voting. Before the case was passed, the secretary of the League, Klagin, delivered a speech saying, "The League's past ideal was to preside over political gatherings. From now on, it should participate in sports competitions, and it should earnestly explain the ridiculousness of religious superstition to the youth of the country, and it should attack religious beliefs without any hesitation. The members of the League should participate in military training to prepare for selection."

<p>(Nanjing) After the end of the special parliament in May, Prime Minister Hirota will reform the administrative institutions, which is the first step in the popular administration reform advocated by the current cabinet. On the one hand, the Cabinet Investigation Bureau and the Legislative Bureau, according to their previous decisions, believe that the following two points should be emphasized as fundamental guidelines when reforming administrative institutions: 1. Reforming the cabinet system and the parliamentary system to correct the current political institutions. 2. Fundamental renovation of personnel administration. However, the government is currently advocating starting with reforming the cabinet system, so the director of the Yoshida Cabinet Investigation Bureau will make important proposals to Prime Minister Hirota within days, and its trend is extremely worthy of attention. The three points advocated by the Investigation Bureau are as follows:</p>
<p>Reform of the Cabinet System</p>
<p>The cabinet meeting, which decides the pivot of national affairs, is currently composed of the Prime Minister and the thirteen Ministers of State, but it has lost the function of a collegial body for conducting sincere consultations and agreements. There is a risk that the cabinet meeting will fall into a formal meeting and there is no possibility of sincere consultations. In fact, it is extremely difficult to discuss matters from top to bottom. This is evident from the need to hold five-minister meetings and internal affairs cabinet member meetings in the past. Since the cabinet has thirteen Ministers of State, it cannot be discussed and decided once an opposing view arises. In other words, important issues are actually decided by the Prime Minister or two or three cabinet members, and there are few cases where the cabinet meeting fully discusses them. Therefore, in order to truly strengthen the cabinet and clarify responsible politics, the function of the cabinet meeting as a collegial body must be brought to the maximum extent. Therefore, the number of Ministers of State must first be limited to six or seven, and all of them must be ministers without portfolio, and each province will have a separate chief. In this way, in addition to the fact that the cabinet meeting can actually decide national policies at the center and effectively strengthen the cabinet, ministers of state can often seek smooth will between each other and can fully develop discussions on national policies.</p>
<p>Renovation of Personnel Administration</p>
<p>A personnel bureau is established in the cabinet to be responsible for the appointment and dismissal of officials in various provinces, except for the army, navy, and judiciary. When officials in various provinces are transferred, the abuse of changing positions due to promotion must be corrected. Specialists must be cultivated in the vertical system. When transferring, it should be limited to within one province. If it is a related matter, in order to seek personal integration between various provinces, it can be carried out between the relevant provinces. The above-mentioned changes, such as transportation relations, can be mutually transferred between the Civil Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the various bureaus of the Railway Ministry, and the Management Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and commercial trade relations can be carried out between the Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the various customs offices of the Ministry of Finance, etc., are sufficient to form an organic personal relationship and can also be used to provide comprehensive training for officials in various administrative departments.

<p>Vienna The conscription system unanimously passed by the Austrian Parliament on April 1 will be implemented this autumn. The government newspaper today disclosed this decision and said that men born in 1915 must be called up for physical examination in June. According to this conscription system, in the event of an emergency, all strong men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five have the obligation to enlist in the army. The Little Entente countries have protested against this conscription system because it violates the Treaty of Saint-Germain. An Austrian newspaper published an official statement in response, saying that this law is not compulsory military service, but only labor service, so it does not conflict with the treaty. The Treaty of Saint-Germain abolishes the Austrian compulsory military service system and limits the Austrian army to 30,000 men. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, led by Lu Xingzhuang, previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, stating that 200 million yuan of the Reconstruction Public Bonds should be allocated to provide mortgage loans for national goods manufacturers, and that industrial control laws and regulations should be promulgated and strictly enforced. The two ministries have repeatedly consulted and submitted the matter to the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Examination Committee for handling. The Ministry of Industry approved the submission, stating that the issuance of Reconstruction Public Bonds relates to the country's overall plan, and its use and distribution should be handled in a unified manner. The request to implement factory mortgage loans will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. As for the industrial control measures, the Ministry is carefully discussing them, and will implement them as soon as a plan is formulated and submitted for approval. Furthermore, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation has not been approved for registration in accordance with the registration rules for agricultural, industrial, and mining groups. Please follow the rules and submit a request for registration. The Ministry of Industry consulted the Ministry of Finance, requesting consideration of factory loans. The Ministry of Finance replied, stating that it had previously received a request from the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation to approve the allocation of 200 million yuan of the Reconstruction Public Bonds to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for the exclusive management of mortgage loans for national goods factories. The Ministry has always attached great importance to rescuing industry and commerce. Last year, the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Examination Committee was established to handle industrial and commercial loans. The Ministry allocated 20 million yuan of Treasury Bills as the second guarantee for the loans to rescue Shanghai's industry and commerce. The ten principles for issuing loans clearly stipulate that loan applications from industry and commerce are limited to factories that manufacture national goods, businesses that sell national goods, and those who transport national goods for export. The Loan Committee was ordered to comply with this, and the Shanghai Banking Association and the Chamber of Commerce were notified accordingly. If the factories of the Association do need loans to relieve them, they should contact them directly in accordance with the loan details regulations approved and approved by the Loan Committee. The reply was in accordance with the previous advice. (Special Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Lanzhou) Surveillance Commissioner of Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia, Dai Kuisheng, has returned to Lanzhou after inspecting Longnan and the Tao River. He is also planning to inspect Longdong. According to him, the governance in various counties of Tao River and Longnan needs urgent rectification. County magistrates often only perfunctorily execute orders from the provincial government, without truly implementing them. Moreover, the district chiefs below the county level are mostly illiterate, and not only are unable to understand government orders, but also abuse their power and act tyrannically in the villages, causing suffering to the people. Each county has two to four hundred or more Baojia chiefs below the district level, each paid eight yuan per month, which adds several thousand yuan to the people's burden. How to promote politics and increase efficiency is a matter that requires the most attention. Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings stipulated that the county is the unit of self-governance, making the county the foundation of politics. However, Chinese counties are vast, and district chiefs have the responsibility to directly implement government orders to the people on behalf of the county magistrate. Therefore, the politics below the county level must involve the careful selection of capable personnel, who are then trained and encouraged before being appointed. Only then can a rapid improvement in local governance be expected. I plan to tour all the counties in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces to compile a book on the political situation in the Northwest, based on my observations, for the reference of the Chinese people.

<p>— Original by Dr. Ralph W. Chaney, Translated by Chen Shaoyan</p>
<p>Scholars have discussed this before. They all believe that these beasts would only gnaw a small hole at the hard end of the nuts and would never chew the entire nut into fragments, just like squirrels do with walnuts and other nuts. At the experimental station of the University of California, dried hackberry fruits were fed to rodents kept in cages, but the results showed that they did not particularly like this type of food and were not accustomed to it, because they never chewed into the inside when eating the hard nuts provided.</p>
<p>The behavior of monkeys kept in cages is even more significant. They quickly accepted these dried fruits and chewed them all into pieces, swallowing the pulp and nut fragments together. However, everyone knows that there were no monkeys living in northern China during the Ice Age. Therefore, the fragments of hard nuts accumulated in the cave should be remnants of food discarded by the ancient cave dwellers, and can be considered garbage, rather than being left behind by rodents.</p>
<p>From this perspective, this can be regarded as the earliest record of humans using plants as food in prehistoric times. In such a cold and dry place, fresh fruits and nuts were rare. We can assume that the "Peking Man" at that time gathered these hackberry fruits from the bushes near his home and crushed them to supplement his meals, just like the natives of the southwestern United States do today. This is the best explanation for the large accumulation of hard nut fragments in the cave.</p>
<p>The cranial capacity of the "Peking Man" skull clearly shows that this early human was able to speak. In our imagination, we seem to be able to hear the "Peking Woman" calling out to the "Peking Child" to eat hackberry pudding in that language that disappeared millions of years ago.</p>
<p>As I was about to leave this cave on a small mountain in northern China, which was the home of ancient humans a million years ago, my Chinese companions kindly gave me the opportunity to choose a piece of breccia from the cave to take away. At that time, I picked up a piece from a pile of materials I had excavated from the cave, which weighed about two pounds. This stone revealed many fragments of burned bones and a large fragment of quartz. Because one end of the stone was uneven and needed to be repaired, I chiseled it off with my hammer. How surprised I was to see that the cross-section of this breccia was almost entirely hackberry kernels!</p>
<p>Although this is just a stone, it contains not only the remnants of food from before human history, including both meat and plants, but also crude stone tools. These tools were used by the "Peking Man" to kill bison, cut fresh meat, and crush the hackberry fruits. These deposits in the caves tell us everything about the dietary habits of ancient humans before humans recorded the details of their lives in writing.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Japan's Southern Advance Policy Establishes the Taiwan Colonization Company to Develop Industries in Taiwan, South China, and Southeast Asia, as an Economic Organization for Implementing the Southern Advance <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Japan has recently been loudly advocating "Northern Defense, Southern Advance." As a result, the Southern Advance policy has become extremely active. Originally, after the joint conference of naval and military departments outside of South China consuls and the army, and the tropical industry conference held last year, the policy toward the south has been very aggressive. After the Hirota cabinet was established, the Governor of Taiwan, Nakagawa, went to Tokyo and proposed the "Establishment of the Taiwan Colonization Company." He obtained Hirota's approval. Recently, the cabinet decided to submit it to the parliament. Most of it can pass the outline of the Colonization Company Act.</p>
<p>*   Name: Taiwan Colonization Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>*   Purpose: To develop Taiwan, South China, and Southeast Asia and promote the development of their industries. Also, to make investments for the same purpose.</p>
<p>*   Capital: 30 million yuan, with an annual amount of 15 million yuan. The government will contribute in kind, and the majority of the remaining annual amount will be contributed by sugar manufacturing companies.</p>
<p>*   Executives: One president and one vice president, three directors, and two supervisors, all appointed by the government, responsible for business operations.</p>
<p>After the Taiwan Governor's Office received the news that the case had been discussed and resolved by the cabinet, the office was very tense. Government official Hiratsuka summoned Internal Affairs Bureau Chief Obana, Industry Bureau Chief Ichinose, Finance Bureau Chief Eto, and other relevant officials to the Governor's Office at 10:00 AM on the 16th to hold a consultation meeting on the establishment of the Colonization Company. It was decided that the heads of relevant departments would each produce specific investigation plans. At 9:00 AM on the 18th, Hiratsuka again summoned Foreign Affairs Section Chief Sakamoto, Investigation Section Chief Haraguchi, Finance Section Chief Yamagishi, and Industry and Commerce Section Chief Suda to discuss in detail the facilities fees for South China and Southeast Asia. The Governor's Office also, taking the development of the Southern Advance as a standpoint, has an annual facility fee budget of nearly 600,000 yuan for the development or expansion of Japanese businesses in South China and Southeast Asia. In Showa 11 (1936), 35,000 yuan was added, making it 617,862 yuan. After the two meetings, Hiratsuka is scheduled to go to Tokyo on the 22nd to meet with Hirota to discuss the Colonization Company plan, so that its implementation can be actively realized. In addition, Suda, Chief of the Industry and Commerce Section, who was specially dispatched by the Governor's Office to inspect industries and commerce in Southeast Asia, returned to Taiwan on the 16th and issued a statement, saying: "Since the Philippines' independence, its relationship with Japan, especially Taiwan, has greatly improved. In the future, there will be great cooperation in the economic field. The economic downturn in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies is very severe, due to the large decrease in sugar production and the fall in rice prices. The British Malayan Peninsula and Singapore are better. In Siam, I met with Mr. Yasukawa and his economic inspection group, and we discussed major activities to cooperate economically with various parties. Since the Siamese revolution, the pro-British policy has changed to a pro-Japanese policy. Recently, the Yokohama Specie Bank will open a branch in Siam, and future development is greatly expected. However, since the products of Taiwan and Southeast Asia are roughly the same, Taiwan's special products must be heavily promoted. Raw materials can be taken from Southeast Asia, then processed in Taiwan, making it industrialized. This is a major fundamental strategy."</p>
<p>On the military front, the Japanese side is strengthening the Magong naval port in Penghu (recently, due to foreign ships repeatedly entering the Magong fortress, the Japanese side believes there is espionage suspicion and has specifically sealed off Magong Port from July 1st, prohibiting foreign ships from entering), and developing aviation. Regular flights between Fukuoka, Japan, and Taipei, Taiwan, have already been launched and will be extended from Taiwan to Bangkok, the capital of Siam, to compete with British aviation between Singapore and Hong Kong. Furthermore, the Japanese government decided to unify the Southern Advance policy and plans to abolish the South Seas Bureau, which is responsible for governing the mandated territory of the South Seas (Caroline) Islands, and make it subordinate to the Governor of Taiwan. Under the Taiwan Governor's Office, a South Seas Bureau would be established to govern it. The army and navy strongly advocate this proposal. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs believes that if such a policy is adopted, the mandated territory will be completely transformed into a colony, which may cause international repercussions. They are still considering it and have not yet implemented it. (April 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Northeast Soybeans Exported to Europe Greatly Increase; Japanese Believe It Is Due to Effective Promotion; Northeast Soybeans Are Entirely Under Japanese Control <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Dalian Dispatch: The three northeastern provinces are known for producing soybeans. In March of this year, the quantity of northeastern soybeans exported from Dalian Port to Europe was 101,529 tons, an increase of 59,472 tons compared to the same month last year. The Japanese believe that these results are due to their effective development of sales channels. The numbers handled by each merchant engaged in exporting are listed below (unit: tons):</p>
<p>| Merchant | Quantity Exported |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| Shilon (實隆) | 35,125 |</p>
<p>| Mitsubishi (三菱) | 14,250 |</p>
<p>| Li Feng (利豐) | 12,875 |</p>
<p>| Mitsui (三井) | 11,750 |</p>
<p>| Dayuan (大元) | 9,375 |</p>
<p>| Zhenxing (振興) | 8,154 |</p>
<p>| Zhenchang (振昌) | 5,125 |</p>
<p>| Other Merchants | 5,250 |</p>
<p>| Total | 101,502 |</p>
<p>From the numbers listed above, it can be seen that Shilon handled the largest amount of exports, followed by Mitsubishi and Li Feng. As for the ships loading the cargo, Japanese ships were still the most numerous. Soybeans are the center of the Northeast's economy, and soybeans are completely in the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Kong Xiangrong Arrives in Jinan to Discuss Key Strategies for Harnessing the Yellow River; Plans to Dredge the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River; Han Asks for a Railway to Be Built Along the Banks <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Kong Xiangrong, Acting Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and Chief Organizer of the Dongzhuang Yellow River Closure Project in Shandong, after the completion of the closure of the breach, went to Beijing and Shanghai to report to the central authorities on the closure situation and to discuss future river defense issues. After finishing his business in Beijing, he took the Shanghai-Ping regular train to Jinan. He arrived in Jinan at 8:10 PM this evening (the 21st). After getting off the train, he went to the Jinpu Hotel to rest. Kong was accompanied by three people, including Zhu Yong, Secretary of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and Deputy Chief Engineer of the Closure Office. According to Kong, his trip to Beijing and Shanghai involved reporting on the negotiations and his mission to Jinan as follows:</p>
<p>Kong's Statement</p>
<p>After the breach was closed, I supervised the construction at the site to consolidate the closure project. Then I went to Beijing and reported the closure process and the closure situation to the National Economic Commission and Minister Kong. I received praise and consolation. Later, because Minister Kong went to Shanghai, I also rushed to Shanghai to discuss with him the post-disaster work of the closure and future flood prevention matters. Minister Kong hopes that no further breaches will occur this year under any circumstances and even hopes that flood disasters can be avoided year after year forever. This is indeed Minister Kong's earnest hope for the people, and I think that everyone across the country shares this sentiment. Those of us who are engaged in river projects are especially concerned. The volume of the Yellow River floods is increasing year by year. Last year's flow rate reached a record high of 18,000 cubic meters per second, while the lower reaches of the river channel are gradually narrowing, and the riverbed is silting up higher and higher, reducing the drainage capacity. According to reports, there is a particularly large accumulation of ice and snow in the upper reaches of Gansu and Ningxia this year. When the ice melts in the summer, it can be predicted that the flood situation will be even greater this year. This situation is very worrying. If we do not plan and prepare in advance, it will be difficult to ensure safety. Currently, the opinion of all parties is that to control the Yellow River, it is necessary to organize a unified management agency, unify authority, and take responsibility for overall planning and management to be effective. Minister Kong also strongly advocates this, but because it involves several provinces and the matter is very important, it is necessary to inquire about the opinions of all parties in detail and plan carefully before there can be specific measures. Now it is planned to discuss measures with all parties. In addition to this, repairing the river channel in the lower reaches is also the most important part of this year's flood prevention work. Because river control cannot rely solely on defense, the fundamental solution must be to dredge the river channel to allow the water to flow smoothly. Since the lower reaches have been silted up too high and the water flow is obstructed, it is necessary to find ways to dredge them to make them smooth. However, this project is very large. I heard that the Shandong Construction Department has already surveyed and planned, but because the project is large and expensive, it has not been possible to start construction. My mission to Jinan is to discuss this matter with Chairman Han. Although the cost is very high, it must be done. In the future, in order to save construction costs, we may use military labor. However, everything must be decided after detailed consultation with Chairman Han, Director Zhang, and others. The post-disaster work of the Dongzhuang closure project is currently underway. The new dike, diversion dam, and closure dam have all been raised and thickened. As per the original plan, the reconstruction of the dike is also underway. Most of the Huangzhuang-Linpuji section of the embankment has been completed. The second and third breaches have been completely closed. Work has also begun on the fourth and fifth breaches. There is currently only a small amount of accumulated water in the sixth breach, and the flow has long been cut off. The Zhudong section of the embankment is also under construction. There are also many post-disaster projects and future handover matters to be discussed with Chairman Han. This is also part of my mission to Jinan. Regarding the Zhukou dangerous section, the general public pays close attention to it. I will allocate 30 million cubic meters of stone materials to be built by local people, and I will also provide considerable subsidies. When I was at the construction site, I had already discussed it with the locals, and they are very happy to do so. As for which sections of the Yellow River project are dangerous and which are safe, no one dares to say for sure. Because the Yellow River's water conditions change rapidly, often a dangerous section in the morning becomes stable in the evening, and a stable section today becomes a dangerous section tomorrow. Therefore, it is difficult to answer when asked about the situation in a particular area. In short, although Zhukou is dangerous, it has the protection of 30 million stones and is unlikely to be unexpected. Yangzhuang, Lengzhai, Xiaoxindi, and other places are more worrying and should be paid attention to. I heard Mr. Pei, the vice engineer of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, say that in the disaster-stricken areas of Jiangsu and Shandong, most of the land has been dried up and replanting is underway. Because Mr. Pei recently visited the disaster areas of Jiangsu and Shandong in person, what he said about the counties in northern Jiangsu and Juye in Shandong is very accurate. I will not stay in Jinan for long. After meeting with Chairman Han, I will return to the Dongzhuang construction site to supervise the post-disaster work.</p>
<p>Dredging the Yellow River</p>
<p>Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, believes that the Yellow River's riverbed is rising day by day, and future prevention and control will become increasingly difficult. He previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to use the method of conscripting labor to dredge the Yellow River estuary, so as to facilitate the outflow of water. It has been approved by the National Economic Commission. It is said that Han has now submitted a request to President Chiang, in addition to stating the recent situation of the Yellow River and requesting active dredging, and also requesting the construction of a railway along the banks, in order to facilitate the transportation of materials and benefit river defense.</p>
<p>Surveying the Lower Reaches</p>
<p>The Shandong River Affairs Bureau starts handling spring engineering projects every year in the spring. This year's spring engineering projects, because last year's disaster relief expenses were huge, the various construction costs for dike repair this year have had to be slightly reduced. In the upper reaches, that is, the construction of the dike from Shilibu to Huanghuasi, which is entirely earthwork, is being supervised by Li Shilin, Director of the Engineering Section of the Bureau, who has gone to supervise the work and started construction. It is reported that four or five tenths of the work has been completed. In another month or so, the entire project will be completed. In the lower reaches, from Wuwangzhuang downward, the dike is also being raised and thickened. The River Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to survey and measure it. As soon as the survey is completed, construction will begin. The Yellow River water level has been continuously dropping for several days. At Luokou on the 20th, the water level dropped six centimeters to 28.34 meters. The labor conditions in the various reaches are stable, and the dangerous sections in the lower reaches have also turned from danger to safety. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Anhui Rice: Large-Scale Transport and Sale to Guangdong and Hubei <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<h3 id="e103">Foreign Rice Tax Increase Leads to Sharp Decline in Imports <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu has always been the pivotal hub for exporting Anhui rice, and the rise and fall of the province's rice market are centered around Wuhu. In recent years, due to the dumping of foreign rice and the barrenness of rice-producing areas, there was almost no rice market to speak of. Rice merchants from the Guangdong and Chaozhou regions specializing in purchasing and transporting rice were mostly desolate. It wasn't until last winter that activity slightly picked up, and exports gradually increased, with various industries also gradually showing signs of vitality. Recently, the rice market has seen another resurgence. Chaozhou merchants such as Tongxin, Changfa, Yifeng, Shunfeng, and Tongfa have collected and transported large quantities, which are successively transported from Wuhu by scheduled ironclad ships to Chaozhou, Shantou, and other places. Following them are merchants such as Fuhe and Fushengxiang, who purchase on behalf of Hubei merchants and transport the rice upstream by river steamers. Statistics show that weekly exports are about 20,000 shi. This kind of foreign trade in Anhui rice has achieved a tremendous turnaround, mainly due to the increased import tax on foreign rice. In recent years, the import volume of foreign rice to the southwestern provinces has been staggering, and even the Yangtze River basin, known for its abundant rice production, has been affected. Since the tax increase, the price of foreign rice has exceeded that of Anhui rice by more than one yuan per shi, causing it to be rejected by buyers. As a result, the source of foreign rice is also decreasing daily. If Anhui rice can maintain a stable market price, the future may be somewhat promising. However, in recent days, the concentrated amount of Wuhu rice has not been very enthusiastic, and the market price has been gradually rising. Top-quality rice reaches nine yuan forty-five cents per shi, while medium and lower qualities are also priced at nine yuan twenty-three cents to eight yuan seventy-eight cents. The reason for this is that the spring famine in various counties in southern Anhui this year is severe. Counties under the jurisdiction of Huizhou are looking forward to assistance from other counties. Hefei, Hanshan, Nanling, and other counties are also taking measures to prevent food shortages, leading to successive bans on rice exports. Therefore, the market price is likely to continue to rise. Whether the foreign trade of Anhui rice can be revived in the future depends on whether the regulation can be appropriate. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Nanhai Foshan City: Cracking a Case of Photocopying Counterfeit Money; Details of the Arrest of Kogerlai in Foshan City; Informant's Account of the Defendant's Counterfeiting Activities <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong province has recently discovered a series of cases of counterfeiting foreign currency. The first and second cases have been detailed in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, on the 13th of this month, the Xinya Hotel in Foshan City, under the jurisdiction of Nanhai County, cracked a case of three foreigners using surgical techniques to photocopy counterfeit foreign currency for use. The two foreign criminals, Kogerlai and his son John, along with another Russian, Alex, resided in room 206 of the hotel. They used chemicals to photocopy foreign banknotes, making copies indistinguishable from the real ones. Later, a traveler in the neighboring room, Mr. Wu, noticed this. Kogerlai asked Wu to find investors to photocopy a large amount of foreign currency for profit. Wu considered it illegal and went to the First Branch of the Foshan Public Security Bureau to report it. The branch chief, Mao Zici, went to investigate and confirmed the facts. He then arrested the three foreigners and sent them to the Nanhai County Office, which transferred them to the Finance Department for interrogation. At noon on the 16th, Wu Rang, the director of the trial division of the Finance Department, interrogated the three foreigners. The head of the secretariat of the Finance Department and others were also present to question them. First, Kogerlai's handcuffs were removed, and he was ordered to photocopy a banknote on the spot using chemicals. However, the photocopying result showed that the white paper did not take on any color. Upon examining the chemicals, it appeared to be a type of Western medicine (Bengxian in transliteration). Kogerlai claimed that he had not counterfeited any foreign currency in the Foshan hotel. The counterfeit money presented as evidence was also genuine, but at the time, he had only altered the last digit of the banknote number as a prank and did not intend to photocopy counterfeit money. After the trial director's interrogation, he believed that the case of photocopying banknotes required detailed interrogation and should not be treated lightly. Therefore, on the 18th, he transferred the case, along with the suspects and evidence, to the Guangzhou Local Court Procuratorate for investigation. In the afternoon of the same day at 4 pm, Prosecutor Lu of the Procuratorate opened the court and interrogated the suspect in the case. He first questioned the informant, Wu Hanglin. According to Wu Zhilin's account, at noon on the 10th of this month, Kogerlai, John, and Alex also arrived at the Xinya Hotel in Foshan and stayed in room 206. The next day, because they were not familiar with the language, the waiters were troubled by them. Wu, witnessing the situation, occasionally helped with translation. As a result, Kogerlai became acquainted with Wu. On the 13th, Kogerlai asked him if he was a Christian. Wu replied that he had been baptized for ten years. Kogerlai considered him a fellow believer and said that he had something to discuss, but it was a secret and required an oath of secrecy before he could tell him. Wu then performed a religious oath ceremony as requested. After the oath, Kogerlai immediately told Wu that they had a wonderful method to photocopy various banknotes. They had used it extensively in Beijing, Tianjin, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuzhou, and other places. He asked Wu to raise capital on his behalf. Since Wu became acquainted with them, they had used the copied counterfeit money many times. Wu believed that this kind of behavior was not tolerated by the law. On the 13th, he rushed to report to Mao Zici, the chief of the First Branch of the Foshan Public Security Bureau, and the Yue Detective Team of Nanhai County. Mao then pretended to be a millionaire and went to visit Kogerlai at the hotel with Wu. Afterwards, Mao reported to the Nanhai County Administrative Office, which dispatched a detective team of fourteen people to lie in ambush. Then Wu and Mao entered to visit. Kogerlai was already seated. Wu introduced Mao's intentions. Mao pretended to be investing in a company. Kogerlai believed it to be true and ordered Mao to swear to heaven. After Mao swore, Kogerlai immediately took out a ten-yuan banknote from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, along with two blank sheets of paper, and photocopied them with chemicals. Mao waited until he finished the process and then gave a signal, ordering the detectives to arrest Kogerlai and others along with the evidence. This was the situation at the time of the case's cracking. He requested to be released on bail. The judge then interrogated the three foreigners in English. According to Kogerlai's statement, he was 34 years old, from Persia, and had been in China for fifteen years. He had first gone to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Peiping (Beijing) and had served in a police academy in Guangxi. He had only recently arrived in Guangdong. As for the counterfeit money, it was not made by him. It was all found on Wu's person. As for his trip to Foshan, he went with Wu. He claimed that he did not engage in any counterfeiting activities. John stated that he was 15 years old and was Kogerlai's son. Alex stated that he was 20 years old, Russian, and a friend of Kogerlai. They both denied any involvement in counterfeiting. After the interrogation, Prosecutor Lu detained Kogerlai and others in the detention center to await further investigation. Wu Zhilin was temporarily granted bail with a guarantor from a shop and was subject to call at any time. (April 19th)</p>

<p>Various agencies in the county are implementing a labor service program for civil servants, designated by the county government to dredge a section of the city river from Fengle Bridge to Hezhuang Bridge, with a length of approximately 300 meters, a dredging depth of 1.00 and 0.80, and a bottom width of four meters. On the morning of the 23rd at 7:30 am, more than 600 civil servants from various agencies gathered in the public sports field. At 8:00 am, an opening ceremony was held, presided over by Shen Zongliang, secretary acting as county magistrate, and Commissioner Wang gave a speech. Subsequently, Wang Zhezhou of the Party Committee and Zhang Yongling of the Independent Detachment of the 12th Security Brigade delivered speeches. Thirty groups from the Party, government, military, and schools participated, lining up and departing in order, parading through the streets for a week to the construction site, each working according to the divided sections. The river project was originally scheduled to be completed in three days, but some were quite diligent in their work. Therefore, the First District Office and the County Party Headquarters completed the work at 4:00 pm that afternoon.</p>

<p>Farmers in Su Township, Guoxiang, and Xietang Township previously rioted over rent. It is now learned that in the Shangtan Village area of Chefang Township, adjacent to Xietang, more than 100 farmers gathered again on the night of the 22nd at around 8 pm to riot over rent, firing earthen guns and demonstrating against the town office, intending to surround it. Subsequently, the district chief of the township, Zhou, notified the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau under its jurisdiction, dispatched Squad Leader Tong and police, and, together with the security team, suppressed the riot, which then subsided. In addition, during the rent riot in Guoxiang, seven people, including Wang Zhaogen (also known as Wang Ajin), Gu Zhangda, Zhang Xingfa, Chu Zhensheng, Li Changsheng, Zhang Maoting, and Ling Shifu, were arrested. After being sent to the county government, Magistrate Deng interrogated them and then sent them to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. Meanwhile, Magistrate Deng reported to the Civil Affairs Department and the Commissioner's Office to request instructions for handling the matter. On the morning of the 23rd, Magistrate Deng again took a motorboat to Zhouzhuang Township, summoning the township and village chiefs for a lecture, advising farmers to clear their rent arrears within this month. He returned to the city that evening and will go to Wei Township again today (24th) to continue advising farmers to pay their rent.</p>

<p>Zhou Weilie, the district chief of the Second District of the Water Police, stated that in recent times, scattered bandits have been harassing and looting villages in the four townships along the lake. The water and land police and security teams of various counties along the lake have once launched a large-scale joint suppression. However, rumors have recently resurfaced. District Chief Zhou specially held a second large-scale muster, from the 28th to the 30th, uniting the five major counties along the lake, such as Wuxi, Wujiang, Suzhou, Wujin, and Yixing, to depart and station troops at various key points such as the East and West Jiaoshan mountains, and to conduct a large-scale search of ships in Taihu Lake. At that time, the district headquarters will send a large number of personnel and several warships to Taihu Lake to conduct a large-scale suppression.</p>

<p>Meng Yuanzhai of Malu Township and Yang Longyun, a resident of the village, recently contracted the earthwork for the central section of the Su-Xi Highway from Wangting to Mucheng. At that time, they subcontracted it to foremen such as Chen San and Xiang Fa. Since the start of construction, they have built more than 1,500 cubic meters of highway. At around 6 pm the night before, the foremen, Chen San and others, led dozens of workers to Yang's house to demand wages. Because the Construction Department had not yet inspected and accepted the road surface and the amount was incorrect, Yang could not pay them immediately. They refused to leave until night. After mutual scuffling, they were brought to the bureau, and both sides were persuaded to mediate. On the morning of the 22nd at around 10 am, the workers again dragged Yang to the Longyuan Teahouse on Malu Road, threatening him in every way and forcing him to hand over the wages. Dozens of workers surrounded Yang, each holding sharp blades, and attacking him. At that time, Yang's head was stabbed with a knife, about an inch deep and four inches wide, with blood flowing freely. His hands, shoulders, and other parts were also severely injured by the knives. He immediately fell to the ground, his life hanging by a thread. The patrol officer from that area arrived after hearing the news and arrested the murderers, Chen San, Xiang Tongfa, Ding Jinyuan, Jin Wansheng, and others. They were transferred to the General Bureau and then to the court for interrogation and detention. The injured Yang Longyun was sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Fourteen Foreign Tea Firms Suspend Exchange Yesterday; Telegraphs Sent for Assistance; City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs President Chiang to Intervene; Orders Anhui Provincial Government to Maintain Original Agreement on Commercial Sales <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After the Foreign Tea Firms Association issued a declaration on the Anhui Province's control over the transport and sale of Qihong tea, they uniformly suspended exchange yesterday morning and telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce, etc., to report. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed Chairman Chiang, the National Economic Commission, and the Anhui Provincial Government, requesting that the original agreement on commercial sales be maintained to show good faith. The Foreign Tea Firms Association also petitioned Zhu Ziwen, a standing committee member of the Economic Commission, for assistance. Details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Implementation of Suspension of Exchange: The fourteen foreign tea firms, including Zhongxinchang, Hongyuanyong, Yongxinglong, Zhenhe, Yitai, Yuanfengrun, Gongshengyong, Shenyuan, Rendeyong, Shengchangsheng, Yilong, Xietai, Tongqin, and Xielong, uniformly followed the resolution of the industry association yesterday morning and suspended the exchange of promissory notes issued by various tea firms to tea merchants in Anhui, totaling more than one million yuan, with varying terms. The association also telegraphed the Anhui Tea Industry Association and the Chamber of Commerce, saying: "To the Tea Industry Association and the Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Anhui Province's control over the transport and sale of black tea, this association and the City Chamber of Commerce have repeatedly requested, but the agreement has been repeatedly overturned or even ignored, placing the tea firms in a desperate situation. We have been forced to publish a declaration that all export tea firms will immediately suspend the exchange of notes. Sincerely, Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association."</p>
<p>Telegram from Tea Manufacturing Industry:</p>
<p>"To Chairman Liu Jun of the Anhui Provincial Government, foreign tea firms have announced their closure due to the control of black tea. More than forty firms in the city of Shanghai rely on the loans from foreign tea firms to support their business. Now that the foreign tea firms have announced their closure, our industry has suddenly lost its financial support, and business will inevitably be difficult. More than forty firms are affected by this, and the livelihood of thousands of workers is cut off, making their lives precarious. Furthermore, tea producers in the producing areas have no one to buy their tea, causing millions of farmers to suffer even more. At this time when tea is being produced, please do not endanger the national export tea industry due to the control of a part, causing it to suffer a setback. We dare to implore you to consider maintaining the foreign tea firms, which is the same as maintaining our industry, and can also help the tea-producing farmers. We make this urgent request, hoping for your consideration. Sincerely, Shanghai Tea Manufacturing Industry Association (stamped)."</p>
<p>Telegram from Economic Commission: The National Economic Commission replied to the City Chamber of Commerce, saying, "To the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, your telegram is acknowledged. We have previously approved your respectful telegram, stating that the joint establishment of a black tea transport and sales committee by Anhui and Jiangxi provinces affects the business of tea firms. We have transferred it to the Anhui Provincial Government for investigation and handling. We have received a reply stating that the black tea produced in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces is of excellent quality and is a precious product among black teas. It originally had a special position in export trade, but because tea merchants and tea farmers have never had a proper organization for liaison, they are subject to manipulation and exploitation, and sales are not free. This has led to a daily decrease in production and a decline in sales. Since it is related to international trade and affects the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, the provincial government's duty is not to stand idly by. With the consent of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, a black tea transport and sales committee was established to be responsible for improving transport and sales, and the establishment meeting was held in Anqing on April 1st of this year to discuss the implementation plan. The resolutions discussed are all based on the entire black tea industry, intending to unify transport and sales to avoid manipulation and exploitation, and do not hinder the loans of tea firms. As for the concerns about the unemployment and creditor's rights of tea firms, the following three proposals have been resolved to provide relief: (1) To recruit talents from tea firms as much as possible to assist in the committee's affairs; (2) If a creditor submits an amount that the debtor acknowledges should be repaid, the committee's sales office will summon both parties after the tea is sold to handle it according to custom. If there are disputes, the two parties will resolve them according to law; (3) For those tea merchants who have already accepted loans from tea firms this year, after the products of the tea merchant are sold out in the future, the proceeds from the tea price, after deducting commissions and advances, will be handed over to the original lender to settle accounts with the tea merchant. If the original lender voluntarily withdraws the loan, before the product is shipped, if the qualifications of the tea merchant and the amount of the loan meet the committee's approval and are verified to be true, the loan and interest will be transferred. As far as the tea firms in Shanghai that operate the export of black tea are concerned, there are only six, and they all also operate green tea, the quantity of which exceeds black tea several times. The various problems regarding black tea are not very serious. Now that various relief measures have been resolved, the tea firms do not need to worry too much." The telegram was previously approved. The Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association has sent representatives to Anhui to propose four compromise opinions. The Provincial Government should also verify and handle the matter according to the opinions proposed by the representatives. Sincerely, Ma (stamped), National Economic Commission. The contents of the letter from the National Economic Commission to the Foreign Tea Firms Association are roughly the same, omitted.</p>
<p>Reply to Economic Commission: "To the National Economic Commission in Nanjing, Ma's telegram is respectfully acknowledged. The reply from the Anhui Provincial Government to your commission contains many evasions and unutterable truths. The Anhui Province's control of Qihong tea this time uses the banner of improving transport and sales, but the so-called control and improvement are not synonymous with provincial operations. Now Anhui Province is independently lending money and independently selling, replacing the position of tea firms. This is using a control policy for tea merchants and an extermination policy for tea firms, while using gentle words of comfort in advance. Once the arrangement is in place, it indicates that it is difficult to reverse the decision. What is this called? The so-called recruiting of talents from tea firms to assist in the committee's affairs is nothing more than ordering them to change from shop owners to shop employees. The so-called submitting of amounts and acknowledging repayment is also no different from ordering them to close down and protect their creditor's rights. These are not the state's intentions to protect the legitimate business of the people. This matter is of great importance to the people's economy. Now that the tea firms have implemented a suspension of exchange and closure, the thirty million export tea industry will immediately stop, and the situation is urgent and the impact is extremely large. It is difficult for your commission to ignore this matter. We still request that you intervene and urgently telegraph Anhui Province to achieve a reversal. Sincerely, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce (stamped)."</p>
<p>Telegram to President Chiang: "Urgent, Kunming, addressed to President Chiang of the Executive Yuan: The establishment of a black tea transport and sales committee by Anhui Province, which brings the tea firm industry that operates foreign export tea after the opening of ports into provincial management, causing tea merchants to lose their jobs, has been repeatedly telegraphed to your Yuan by the affiliated association. Approval was granted for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult with Anhui Province to handle the matter properly. The tea merchants also personally went to Anhui Province to earnestly negotiate and agree on provincial management for transport and commercial management for sales, striving to leave a chance for the merchants to survive. Unexpectedly, Anhui Province still has changes to the case presented in person. Under the transport and sales committee, a sales group is established, allowing it to recruit talents from tea firms to handle the matter, which is equivalent to officials selling on their own and merchants serving as shop employees, fundamentally exterminating the tea firms. Efforts to appeal have been exhausted, and the tea firms have been forced to stop exchanging and close down all notes issued from today. We believe that Qihong tea is a major export trade, and tea firms have a history of nearly a century. As matters stand, it not only affects foreign sales and affects Shanghai's financial industry, but also officials seize commercial opportunities, making merchants' legitimate businesses lose all protection. This is of great concern to national credibility and public sentiment. Considering that you are admired by the whole country and all matters of state rely on your fair judgment, since there is nothing to appeal to in Anhui Province, we must respectfully petition your seat, urgently request your intervention, and order the Anhui Provincial Government to maintain the original agreement on commercial sales to show good faith and maintain the lifeblood of export tea merchants. Sincerely, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce (stamped)."</p>
<p>Reply from Anhui Province: "To the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, your telegram has been read and acknowledged. The Anhui and Jiangxi provinces' improvement of black tea transport and sales this time takes into account both tea farmers and tea merchants. If the tea firms can eliminate the various exploitations of tea merchants in the past, reduce the monthly interest rate on loans to eight percent, and listen to the transport and sales committee's unification of transport with the most convenient methods, and the sales are subject to the supervision and command of the transport and sales office, the committee can recruit talents from tea firms as much as possible to undertake sales affairs. All two percent of the commission can be waived from deduction by the committee. According to the situation presented by the tea firm representatives who came to Anhui in person, we have clearly informed them. There are some discrepancies between the points raised in the presentation by the Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association and the informed method, and instructions have also been issued. If the Foreign Tea Firms Association can sincerely accept this, it will be beneficial to both public and private interests. The general transport and sales office of the transport and sales committee will send personnel to Shanghai to set up a sales group immediately, which can be contacted nearby for handling. I hope you will persuade them not to cause disturbances. Sincerely, Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government (stamped)." "To the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, your telegram has been read and acknowledged. Telegram is to announce the resolution of the transport and sales committee. is to instruct the tea firm representatives on the method. According to the presentation from the Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association, instructions have been issued to still follow the method shown in the telegram and sincerely negotiate with the Shanghai transport and sales office for handling. We have also telegraphed your Chamber of Commerce in detail on the same day. The matter concerns the revitalization of the tea industry, and the government's promulgation of laws and regulations is difficult to change. I hope you will explain this and handle it according to the telegram. Do not put yourselves in a desperate situation. Sincerely, Chairman Liu Zhenhua (stamped)."</p>
<p>Telegram to Anhui Province Again: "To the Anhui Provincial Government in Huaining, the two telegrams have been respectfully acknowledged and forwarded to the Foreign Tea Firms Association, which stated that the key points presented in person in Anhui Province have been completely overturned. What is this called? Now that all the tea firms have stopped exchanging and closed down, the thirty million export tea industry has immediately stopped. As matters stand, this association is also at the end of its persuasion. We humbly report this. Sincerely, Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce (stamped)."</p>
<p>Petition to Song for Assistance: "The Foreign Tea Firms Association yesterday presented to Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Commission, saying, 'The Anhui Province's control of black tea transport and sales aims to provincial management and monopoly, competing with the people for profits. Its previous expressions to our industry have been extremely strange and changeable. At first, it agreed that it would not hinder the loans of tea firms, and then it agreed to accommodate the compromise plan proposed by the petition representatives. However, these were all promises that were quickly overturned. It also sent personnel to Qimen and other producing areas to actively lend money, which has caused the previous debts of tea firms and the loans issued this year to lose protection. It has also deprived the loan business and tea sales business that have been followed for decades since the opening of ports without leaving anything behind. It is feared that its intentions will intensify and expand to control even green tea. The industry is deeply afraid of this. An emergency meeting was convened and resolved to suspend exchange and close down from the 21st. The City Chamber of Commerce comforted us and postponed the implementation for two days. At the same time, we urgently telegraphed Anhui Province, requesting that it accommodate us according to the previously agreed-upon method. However, up until yesterday afternoon, we did not receive a request. If we do not earnestly implement the previous resolution, it will not be enough to seek self-preservation. All the details can be seen in the declaration and do not need to be elaborated. The people's freedom to operate is clearly permitted by law, and the special privileges of industrial and commercial rights belong to the central government. The laws of the period of political tutelage also have clear regulations, which cannot be decided by any local government without authorization. Moreover, export trade affects the people's livelihood and the national economy. Even if merchants' hard-earned capital can be ignored, the local economy and the nation's vitality are at stake. How can we allow those with no experience to try as they please? The industry, in order to preserve business capital and take into account the national industry, besides enduring the pain of sacrifice and waiting quietly for a solution, should report the matter in detail and respectfully ask you to quickly provide assistance so that the people's livelihood will not perish together with the tea firm business in one fell swoop. We will be forever grateful.''"</p>
<p>Impact on Charitable Donations: "The Shanghai Huining Guild Hall telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government yesterday regarding the Anhui Province's control of Qihong tea transport and sales, saying, 'To Chairman Liu of the Anhui Provincial Government, since the guild hall was established in Shanghai, the annual expenses required for charitable acts such as providing coffins and clothes, medical assistance, and burying coffins have all relied on the box donations solicited by the Foreign Tea Firms. This has been the case for ninety years without interruption. We have heard that the Foreign Tea Firms have been affected by the Anhui Province's control of Qihong tea transport and sales and have publicly decided to implement a suspension of exchange and closure. This means that the government is directly placing the Foreign Tea Firms in a desperate situation, and indirectly causing the guild hall's charitable work to be suspended. The guild hall and the Foreign Tea Firms are closely related and cannot remain silent. We are therefore telegraphing you to request that you verify and handle the matter quickly to maintain the tea firms' business. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. Sincerely, Shanghai Huining Guild Hall (stamped).'"</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Ning Shao Steamer Encountered a Great Peril on the Huangzhou River <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>A Sudden Attack of Wind, Rain, and Hail in the Deep Dark Night Caused Both Anchors to Break – A Perilous Voyage Luckily Reached Jiujiang</p>
<p>The Old Ning Shao Steamer of the Ning Shao Steamer Company in this port, built in 1906, with a deadweight of 3,074 tons, a registered tonnage of 1,920 tons, a length of 283 feet, a breadth of 44 feet 7 inches, a depth of 16 feet 6 inches, a draft of 10 feet, and a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour, has always sailed</p>
<p>on long shifts.  It was decided that this steamer would load a large quantity of goods and passengers in Hankou and depart downstream to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 21st. When the ship set sail, the weather was very good with no wind or waves. Unexpectedly, at 12 o'clock that night, when it reached the Huangzhou River upstream of Jiujiang, the weather suddenly changed. First, a torrential rain poured down like a waterfall, and then a strong wind rose, shaking trees and mountains. Huge waves stirred up in the middle of the river, and finally,</p>
<p>hail fell suddenly, as large as pebbles. The deep night was as dark as pitch, and the river surface was indistinguishable within a short distance. At this time, the Ning Shao Steamer was under attack by heavy rain, hurricane, hail, and fierce waves, and a very dangerous situation arose on the river. The ship shook violently, and the passengers were terrified. It is said that the captain, seeing this situation, found it difficult to continue sailing. For the sake of the safety of the lives and property of the entire ship, he had to temporarily stop and quickly</p>
<p>drop both anchors, hoping to wait for the storm to pass before sailing again. However, the wind, rain, and hail continued to fall madly, and the waves on the river were stirred up by the strong wind, coming like mountains toppling over and seas overturning. The Ning Shao Steamer dropped both anchors, thinking that it would be safe, but who knew that the force of the wind and waves was impacting the hull of the ship, and the ship still could not withstand it, causing the thick iron chains of both anchors to crackle and clang under the impact of the huge waves and strong wind. Then, with a loud bang,</p>
<p>both anchors broke and sank to the bottom of the river. The mooring chains also broke off more than 75 fathoms, and the swaying of the ship became even more dangerous. It is said that the captain decisively started the engine at this time, braving all difficulties and sailing downstream at great risk. By good fortune, it safely reached Jiujiang on the morning of the 22nd, preserving the lives and property of the entire ship. When it arrived at Xunyang, all the passengers on board looked at each other with joy. The captain temporarily borrowed two anchors from another ship for</p>
<p>emergency navigation. Yesterday, the captain telegraphed from Xunyang to Shanghai, stating, in brief, that the Old Ning Shao Steamer, around 12 o'clock on the evening of the 21st, encountered heavy rain, hurricane, and hail in the Huangzhou River, and the weather was unusually dark, making it impossible to see anything on the river surface. For safety, he dropped both anchors, but unexpectedly both anchors broke, leaving no other option but to risk sailing downstream. By good fortune, it arrived at Xunyang at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 22nd and has now borrowed two anchors from a Man steamer for emergency use. Please quickly prepare anchor chains of 75 fathoms and transport them for use, and so on. After receiving the telegram, the Ning Shao Company has already prepared the heavy chains and transported them.</p>

<p>All Crew Members Were Fortunately Rescued, Resulting in a Loss of 70,000 to 80,000 Yuan. The Wan Tai, owned by the Zhaoxing Shipping Company in this port, which specializes in traveling to the Dalian Bay area of North China, was unloading cargo at the 15th pier in Dalian yesterday morning when the Shokoku Maru (a European liner) of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company was turning around at the same location and violently struck the Wan Tai's left stern, creating a large hole. The Wan Tai, with a displacement of just over 700 tons, suffered extensive damage from the impact of the vessel, which displaced over 10,000 tons. The vessel sank in just 15 minutes, but fortunately, all of the crew members were rescued.

<p>The Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Propaganda Week jointly organized by the City Party Headquarters and various circles in this city held its fourth day yesterday (23rd), which was the propaganda day for performers. More than 3,000 performers throughout the city separately promoted the meaning of anti-smoking and anti-drug. Students from Shanghai Girls' Middle School paraded in formation yesterday afternoon. Today is the film propaganda day, and all cinemas in the city will show anti-smoking and anti-drug films. Tomorrow is the propaganda day for various groups, and various groups will organize propaganda teams on this day, and the Juvenile Propaganda Corps will dress up for propaganda. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Performers' Propaganda Day</p>
<p>More Than 3,000 Performers Propagandized</p>
<p>Yesterday (23rd) was the fourth day of Propaganda Week, which, according to the prescribed procedure, was the performers' propaganda day. The preparatory committee had printed propaganda outlines in advance and consulted with the Shanghai Performers' Association. All members of the association were fully mobilized for propaganda, totaling more than 3,000 people. They served as performers in various entertainment venues such as Yong'an, Sincere, New World, Shanghai New World, Great Thousand World, Great World, and Small World, as well as in Suzhou opera, monologue, Shanghai storytelling, Pinghua ballad singing, drama and other venues, and film broadcasting, all interspersing the meaning of anti-smoking and anti-drug.</p>
<p>Shanghai Girls' Middle School Paraded Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Shanghai Girls' Middle School in Xieqiao took anti-smoking and anti-drug as the late Premier's legacy, the government is determined to eliminate it, and the public should cooperate and promote it. Not only should students understand this meaning, but the general public should also pay attention. Therefore, they specially made many cloth and paper slogans and pictures, and at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, they ordered all students to set off in a parade. Led by the Boy Scout band, the road was blocked wherever they went, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The audience paid a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Minli Girls' Middle School Continued Lectures</p>
<p>The Minli Girls' Middle School on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi, because the academic propaganda day for the Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Propaganda Week on the previous day coincided with rain, making it inconvenient to set off, sent more than 20 students to organize a propaganda team to carry out supplementary propaganda yesterday morning and afternoon. A reporter from the National News Agency went to the Nine Mu Di yesterday and happened to hear the propaganda team giving a lecture, which was very moving to the listeners. According to news from the City Education Association, there were other schools that carried out supplementary propaganda yesterday.</p>
<p>Today is Film Propaganda Day</p>
<p>All Theaters in the City Will Show Additional Films</p>
<p>Today is the fifth day of Propaganda Week, which belongs to the film propaganda day. The preparatory committee specially made a large number of anti-smoking and anti-drug films in advance and sent them to Jin Cheng, Star, Shanxi, New Central, West Sea, East Sea, Central, Guanghua, World, Jinrong, Carde, Huade, Republic, Shanghai, Penglai, Wanguo and other cinemas in this port for additional screenings, so that the audience would know the harm of smoking and drugs. It is heard that these films have been screened in various theaters since the 20th to assist the government in eliminating the atmosphere of drugs.</p>
<p>Commanders and Disciplinarians Are Mostly Appointed</p>
<p>As the date for the lantern parade is approaching, the preparatory committee has written to various agencies and organizations, in order to unify command in all circles, asking them to appoint a general commander, deputy commander, general disciplinarian, and deputy disciplinarian. It is now heard that those who have been appointed include Lin Meiyan as the general commander of the City Party Headquarters, Chen Weiyi as the deputy commander, Zhang Xiaotong as the general disciplinarian, Zhang Yingzeng as the deputy disciplinarian, Zheng Zeguang as the general commander of the Public Security Bureau, Xie Xiumian as the deputy commander, Wang Yupei as the general disciplinarian, Ding Shunbao as the deputy disciplinarian, Yu Zhenhui as the general commander of the City Farmers' Association, Zhang Huijun as the general disciplinarian, Yuan Hongjun as the general commander of the City Chamber of Commerce, Xin Jianxin as the deputy commander, Li Fanglan as the general disciplinarian, Wang Rongkun as the deputy disciplinarian, Huang Zaoxiong as the general commander of the City Education Association, Zhang Lichun as the deputy commander, Wang Longzhang as the general disciplinarian, and Huang Kegui as the deputy disciplinarian.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the Propaganda Day for Various Groups</p>
<p>Various Groups Will Organize Propaganda Teams</p>
<p>Tomorrow (25th) is the sixth day of Propaganda Week, which is the propaganda day for various groups according to regulations. The preparatory committee convened a discussion meeting with representatives of various groups a few days ago, and the City Farmers' Association, the General Labor Union, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, the Boy Scout Council, and the Anti-Drug Association will conduct propaganda separately, and each has ordered its subordinates to organize propaganda teams and go to various places for propaganda and lectures, following the organizational methods of party member and student propaganda teams.</p>
<p>Children's Groups' Costume Lecture Meeting</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the propaganda day for various groups, and they are extremely enthusiastic about various propaganda activities. This time, the City Party Headquarters is holding an anti-smoking and anti-drug propaganda week. In order to make citizens understand the harm of smoking and drugs, the group has specially decided to hold a costume lecture from 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. tomorrow. Nearby residents are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Registering to Quit Smoking Costs Nothing</p>
<p>When a reporter from the National News Agency passed by the Nine Mu Di the day before yesterday, he saw several propaganda teams from the Party Headquarters giving lectures on anti-smoking. There were many listeners. Someone said that registering with the Public Security Bureau requires a fee, and asking for help in quitting smoking requires a guarantor. The reporter learned yesterday from a spokesperson of the City Party Headquarters that there is now a type of certificate for the poor that costs nothing. Furthermore, in order to take care of the poor, if someone is determined to quit smoking, they only need to have a friend with a legitimate occupation as a guarantor, and there is no need to pay any additional fees.</p>
<p>Yang Hu Speaks on the Meaning of Rejecting Drugs</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu spoke at the Greater China Radio Station from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (22nd). His words were as follows: Fellow citizens, brothers, I am usually very busy with official duties and rarely have the opportunity to meet and talk with you. Today, I am taking the opportunity of this city's anti-smoking and anti-drug propaganda week to speak with you, fellow citizens, as if we were speaking in the same room, which I find very pleasant. I believe that many of you already know the harms of opium and drugs. Today, due to time constraints, I can only briefly talk about the meaning of anti-smoking and anti-drug. I hope that after everyone hears it, they will persuade each other. This is not only a supplement to the current anti-smoking and anti-drug propaganda, but also has a great relationship with the future of our revitalizing the Chinese nation. Examining the history of the spread of opium and drugs to China, it first came from India. It was not until the Daoguang period of the late Qing Dynasty that British merchants transported it to China in large quantities. At that time, our countrymen did not know the advantages and disadvantages and bought and smoked it with each other, so that in just a few years, the number of people who smoked opium gradually increased. At that time, Mr. Lin Zexu of Guangdong and Guangxi, seeing the harm of opium, not only could it destroy the country, but it was enough to exterminate the race. Therefore, he resolutely implemented a ban on people smoking opium. At the same time, he burned the imported opium regardless of everything. Unexpectedly, the United Kingdom protested and demanded compensation, which led to the Opium War. At that time, because our country lacked military preparedness, the result was a defeat. From then on, the shackles of all unequal treaties were tightened day by day, and the national situation became increasingly depressed. Therefore, from the history of the Opium War, we can see that opium is not only a poisonous substance that gradually weakens our country's physique, but also a dangerous step that causes our country's national status to decline. Fellow compatriots with blood and spirit, don't you feel heartbroken about this? Citizens with this bad habit, shouldn't you quickly make up your minds to quit it? Furthermore, from the perspective of the people who smoke opium and drugs themselves, which one is not physically weak and mentally depressed? They naturally have no energy to do personal business on weekdays, and they are even less able to shoulder their due responsibilities to society, the country, and the nation. Can a country of sick men and a country full of smoking and drugs still compete for existence in the twenty-first century, where the fittest survive? If this harm is not removed, the entire Chinese nation will probably have no foothold on the earth. Now that our country and nation are weakening day by day, and the future is unknown how serious it will be, our leader Chairman Chiang, in order to revitalize our nation and protect the entire country, promulgated 13 articles of the Smuggling Prohibition Implementation Measures and 12 articles of the Drug Prohibition Implementation Measures last year, and established the Smuggling Prohibition Headquarters, with Chairman Chiang serving as the director. These two measures are extremely strict, and the time limit is also very short. If people with smoking and drug addictions do not quickly register in accordance with the regulations and quickly take medicine to quit, they will have no chance of self-renewal in the future. Even if we do not have the idea of saving the country and seeking survival, and we do not have the ambition to defend the country, do we not pay attention to protecting our own bodies and saving our own lives? Citizens from all walks of life, you must know that Chairman Chiang also serves as the director of Smuggling Prohibition, and his words are followed by law. Our revolutionary government will never follow the old ways and compromise. Haven't you seen that in the capital Beijing and Shanghai, many drug dealers of red and white pills have been shot? Citizens from all walks of life, now is the time for us to save ourselves and seek survival. The government will never relax its efforts on this anti-smuggling policy, which is related to the safety of the entire nation. Our citizens who have bad habits should be decisive and hold the determination to die rather than violate the ban, and quickly get out of the sea of suffering. Think carefully, for yourself and for the nation, you should not delay any longer.</p>

Those who still fail to exchange after the deadline will be sentenced to imprisonment. Therefore, banks have been very crowded with people exchanging legal tender in recent days. It is expected that before the 3rd of next month, all silver deposits in areas where legal tender circulates will be exchanged without remainder. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance believes that there are still many areas in border provinces where legal tender has not yet circulated, and people's silver deposits may not be able to be exchanged for legal tender within the deadline. To take care of the interests of the people in the border areas, it is currently studying flexible measures to remedy the situation. As for private silver deposits in areas where legal tender circulates, they must be exchanged for legal tender within the deadline to avoid unexpected losses and being sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Xue Cixin Returned to Shanghai Yesterday After Inspecting Highway Conditions in Europe and America <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Xue Cixin, Chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Works Bureau of this city, was dispatched by the National Economic Commission and the Municipal Government to investigate the situation abroad. After spending half a year traveling through European and American countries, he returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m. aboard the German Mail Steamer "Bausden." Those who went to welcome him included Li Dachao, Section Chief of the Municipal Government, Shen Yi, Director of the Works Bureau, Li Ting'an, Director of the Health Bureau, Tan Wenqing, Xu Guansan, Qiu Xiejun, and Xiao Qingyun, Section Chiefs of the Works Bureau, Wu Liguo, Section Chief of the Health Bureau, Chen Zonghan, Section Chief of the Public Utilities Bureau, Engineer Dong Dayou, and dozens of Xue's relatives and friends. After landing, he went straight to his private residence to rest. According to a written statement issued by Xue to a reporter from the Central News Agency,</p>
<p>Traveling Through Various Countries</p>
<p>This time, Xue Cixin was dispatched by the National Economic Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate road administration in Europe and America. Since October 1st of last year, he traveled by the same ship with Mr. Ao Jingji, a consultant of the League of Nations' experts, to the United States and then to Europe, visiting eight countries including England, France, Germany, and the United States, for a period of nearly seven months. After arriving in San Francisco in the United States, he changed to a car and traveled along the southern highway of the United States, passing through ten provinces including California and New Mexico, to the US capital Washington, where he met Mr. McDonald, the director of the highway department there, and thanked him for his kindness in sending engineers to receive him along the way. The highways traveled in the United States totaled more than 8,500 kilometers, lasting 30 days. There are detailed highway maps and various route signs in all the places passed, so even though the people and places are unfamiliar, there is no risk of getting lost. Gas stations and travelers are available along the way, so car travel in the country is very convenient. After staying in Washington for a few days, he went to New York, took the European steamer across the Atlantic Ocean, and arrived in Chabaden, France, and then traveled by car through France and Switzerland to Berlin, the capital of Germany, for a total of more than 3,000 kilometers. He stayed for ten days, and Consultant Ao took the car back to Warsaw, Poland. Cixin stayed in Berlin for inspection for a month and a half. Thanks to the introduction of Director Shen, he met Dr. Todt, the chief engineer of the German national highway. In late January, he left Germany for Poland and stayed in Warsaw for ten days. He is still grateful for the hospitality of the Ministry of Transportation of that country and Consultant Ao. Later, he took the road to Rome, Paris, and then to London, the capital of England. Thanks to the introduction of Zhao, Deputy Director of the Economic Commission, he met Sir Brice, the chief engineer of roads of the British Ministry of Transportation. After staying in England for inspection for a month and a half, he took the German ship "Bausden" back to China.</p>
<p>Investigation Situation</p>
<p>This time, what Cixin investigated in the United States was mostly crude oil roads and asphalt roads. What was investigated in Germany and Poland was stone roads and cement roads. What was inspected in England was the method of building roads with gas asphalt, and more attention was paid to the collection and testing of road building materials. What Cixin saw this time was that road administration in various countries is very developed, but the construction of new roads and the improvement of old roads are still constantly being carried out. Moreover, in the construction of road surfaces, more emphasis is placed on the use of domestic materials and less on the policy of purchasing foreign raw materials, which impressed Cixin too deeply. There are also dozens of kinds of road surface construction methods, but because of the different raw materials and economic conditions, there are not many that can be directly adopted by our country. Because of the need to solve the road surface problem of our country's highways, it still depends on our own efforts and research in the future to find a way out, and the spirit of European and American engineers to use domestic materials to build the road surface of their own country's highways should be regarded as a guide. All the detailed information collected in various countries will be compiled into a report within a few days and submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the National Economic Commission.</p>

<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that, according to the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, regarding the export of surplus salt from various districts to Japan for use as industrial salt, the Ministry of Finance has now thoroughly reviewed the case. In order to adapt to the current actual situation, four measures are stipulated: 1. If there are surplus salt slices in various districts, they will be allowed to be exported to Japan for use as industrial salt, but only after being certified by the Japanese Monopoly Bureau will they be allowed to be exported to Japan; 2. Merchants in various districts who request export should first submit a written request to the local salt affairs authorities, which will conduct a thorough examination to ensure that they are purely Chinese merchants with substantial capital. The request will be submitted to the headquarters for review and verification, and they will be officially appointed as exporters. Those who submit written requests directly to the headquarters will be ordered to be examined and reported by the competent authorities in each district before being approved. The number of exporters will be fixed at three or more in each district, and a trial will be conducted for one year; 3. The tax rate for industrial salt exported to Japan from various districts will be temporarily set at one yuan per ton, and a cash deposit or a solid bank guarantee should also be levied at the highest tax rate in each district; 4. When salt is exported, all procedures regarding inspection and other matters should still be handled in accordance with the measures for exporting Chinese salt.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Qingdao Road: Murder Case Occurs, Man and Woman Die Tragically in a Pool of Blood <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Road, under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession's Xinzha Police Station, is located between Xinzha Road and Avenue Edward VII, extending east to Park Road (commonly known as Soy Sauce Alley) and west to Medhurst Road. It is no more than forty or fifty zhang in length. On the south side of the road is a large open space. Last year, Chenxing Lane, a municipal housing complex, was newly built, providing over two hundred rooms. The municipal housing consists of three-story buildings. In the room of the pavilion at No. 51 Qingdao Road (back door leading to No. 39 Chenxing Lane), a bloody incident suddenly occurred. The second landlord, surnamed Wang, is blind and lives on the mezzanine of the first and second floors. He heard the woman surnamed Huang in the pavilion shouting for help and immediately went to check (because the mezzanine where the second landlord lives is opposite the pavilion). He found that the door to the pavilion room was tightly closed, and there was no sound. Therefore, the second landlord immediately ran to report to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. They opened the door and saw that both the man and woman were lying in a pool of blood. The man was lying on the bed with his throat cut, and the woman was lying on the cement floor in front of the bed, with six or seven stab wounds on her neck, head, and chest. The police immediately summoned an ambulance and sent the bodies to the morgue for examination. After investigation, it was learned that the deceased had moved in around October of the previous lunar year and had no children or other family members. It is unknown why such a tragedy occurred. However, judging from the situation, it seemed that the tenant surnamed Huang had first stabbed the woman to death and then hanged himself. The second landlord could not determine the exact cause. It was also learned that the house was a three-story single-family building facing north, housing more than ten families, including those surnamed Xue, Chen, and Wei, so the situation was very complicated.</p>

<p>At Majia Mountain, four li away from West Lake in Hangzhou, news suddenly emerged that a tiger had attacked and injured a pedestrian.

Therefore, the zoo immediately formally wrote to the Hangzhou Municipal Government, asking for permission to capture the tiger if the report was true. It is now learned that the zoo has received a reply from the Hangzhou Municipal Government, requesting the zoo to send people to Hangzhou to capture the tiger and inviting the Hangzhou Equestrian and Archery Association to assist.</p>

The details are recorded below. Li Qi, a woman from Yangzhou, 30 years old, who lives at No. 246 Dongxin Lane, Jiasiyi Road, in the French Concession, has a four-year-old daughter named Qiaofeng. The day before yesterday, the 21st, at 1:00 PM, Qi's sister-in-law, Zeng, took Qiaofeng to play at the entrance. When Zeng went to the nearby public stove to get water and returned home, Qiaofeng suddenly disappeared. Zeng immediately searched to Xieqiao and saw a woman, Li Zhao, 37 years old, from Anhui, leading Qiaofeng. So she called the police and brought them to the police station. After interrogation by Detective Zhang and others, Zhao confessed that the kidnapping organization was located in a shed at No. 144 Xinxin North Lane, Rue du Père Robert.

<p>Zhang Zhiliang from Pudong, nicknamed Little Monk, has been operating a beef stall at the Hongkou market, and his business is thriving. He originally married a woman surnamed Sun from the same village, and they have been married for five years, but have never had children. Sun is now 25 years old, but Zhang worried that she might not be able to bear a child. Therefore, he looked for a woman suitable for bearing sons. He learned of Zhang Shen's daughter, Erbao, who was only 28 years old. He asked someone to act as a matchmaker, and on October 16th of last year, he formally married Erbao at the Dahonglou Restaurant on Wuma Road. This caused Sun to feel resentful, so she reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Detective Huang Fusen and a Western detective went to Zhang's house at No. 3 Fengjili, Miller Road, around 1:00 AM yesterday and arrested Zhang and Erbao together. They were detained separately. At 9:00 AM, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Yang Qianchang presided over the trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution against Zhang Zhiliang and Shen Erbao for adultery under Article 236 of the Criminal Code, requesting punishment. Zhang Sun stated that her husband had committed bigamy with Shen and abandoned her. Zhang Zhiliang confessed that he remarried Erbao because Sun was ill and could not bear children.

<p>Since last year, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the area west of Huangjia Garden, bordering Shangsong in Shanghai West, but the perpetrators have not been captured. Wang Zhizhang, the patrol officer of the Hongqiao Road Police Station, recently received a tip that Wang Jinchuan, a local carpenter who lives at No. 11 Wanggeng Lane, south of Hongqiao Town, was significantly involved in the robberies. Around 10:00 PM the night before last, he personally led police officers Shi Luchun, Yuan Qingyu, Zheng Shaoqing, and investigators Hu Shousi, Zhou Renxian, and Zheng Bucai to the address. Wang Jinchuan was arrested that night, and a hunting rifle and half a box of bullets were confiscated. (The bullets were robbed from Wu Ayong's house in Wangjia Lane, Song County, and have been identified by the victim). He was taken back for interrogation, and the thief admitted to the robberies. He confessed to several robberies and identified more than ten accomplices. After obtaining the confession, Patrol Officer Wang, along with the thief, went to No. 33 Xudinghui, Xujiahui, Xuzhen Road, and arrested Zhu Jiugao (also known as Anan, 41 years old, from Nanhui), confiscating fifteen pawn tickets.

<h3 id="e135">Japanese Sailor Shooting Case: No Political Implications <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Concession authorities believe it was an ordinary nightclub brawl. The clue to solving the case was obtained from a Little Guangdong who pawned a pistol. A hole in a Western book was found shaped like a pistol.</p>
<p>On the night of November 9th of last year, Zhongshan Xiuxiong, a sailor from the Japanese fleet stationed in Shanghai, was shot and killed by gunfire on North Sichuan Road and Baolean Road. The murderer escaped. The military police authorities of the city and the concession police conducted a thorough investigation and offered a large reward, but six months have passed without any progress. Only this Monday and Tuesday did the Special Political Department of the Public Concession Police Department successively arrest three Chinese people related to the murder and send them to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. However, both the court and the police department believe that this case is extremely important. During this investigation, absolute secrecy should be maintained, and no procedures should be disclosed to avoid hindering the investigation. Therefore, although the court has held two preliminary hearings, only a few responsible personnel were allowed to attend. The secrecy was unprecedented. Therefore, the various news reports about the solving of the case in the Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days have been vague. The outside world originally paid close attention to the case, but now the reports are vague, leading to speculation. To avoid causing confusion among the public, we have inquired with a certain party to clarify the actual situation of the solving of the case, and record it as follows. The degree to which the detainees are suspected of being involved in the case will only be clear after a public trial in the future, and cannot be speculated at present.</p>
<p>Investigation Process:</p>
<p>After Zhongshan Xiuxiong's death, the Japanese military headquarters and the Public Concession Police Department sent senior officials to the scene of the incident to investigate. A B.P. brand pistol was found at the scene, proving that this pistol was used to kill Zhongshan Xiuxiong. Later, someone reported to the police that they had seen a person named Little Guangdong pawn a pistol of the same brand with Guangdong native Zeng Yuan for a loan. The police summoned Zeng Yuan, and after examining several pistols, including the one found at the scene, Zeng Yuan took out the one found at the scene, saying that it was Little Guangdong's pawn. Since the loan had been repaid, the gun had been returned to Little Guangdong. Therefore, the police began to investigate Little Guangdong's whereabouts. Initially, there were no clues, so his whereabouts remained unknown for several months. Recently, it was learned that Little Guangdong was in Qingdao, so a few days ago, experienced detectives were selected to go to Qingdao by ship and arrest Little Guangdong. By last Sunday, Little Guangdong had not yet been escorted to Shanghai, but the police had already arrested two Chinese people, A and B, in a certain place. A Western book was found in A's residence, with a hole dug out that was shaped like a pistol. When the found pistol was inserted, it fit perfectly. A was considered to be involved, and B was arrested because of his close relationship with A. On Monday afternoon, the police first sent A and B to the First Special Court, where Judge Xiao Xiefei held two preliminary hearings and ordered them to be remanded in custody. The next morning, Little Guangdong was escorted from Qingdao and sent to the court, where Judge Feng Shide questioned him once and also ordered him to be remanded in custody. It is now heard that the three will be brought to the court for further hearing next Monday.</p>
<p>Reports in Western Newspapers:</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the Public Concession authorities stated yesterday that the shooting death of Japanese sailor Zhongshan Xiuxiong on November 9th of last year had no political motive, but was merely the result of an ordinary brawl in a nightclub. Although the recent developments in this case are still being kept secret, according to personnel who were previously involved in the investigation of this case, their speculation is that the recent arrest of five Chinese people (three men and two women, one of whom is a dancer) shows that the case has no political connection. One of the two women is Chen Guizhen from Ningbo, and the other is Ye Lin from Guangdong. Both were arrested at the Yuegong Dance Hall on Sichuan Road. They will probably be sent to court for questioning this morning. Since the arrest of these two women, the number of suspects arrested in this case has reached six. In addition to the five Chinese people, the other person is a Korean, who was arrested by the police station of the Japanese Consulate in Seoul and is still in the hands of the Japanese authorities. According to news obtained by the Continental Daily yesterday, there will probably be more suspects arrested in this case. It is heard that one of them is closely related to the case and is urgently awaiting capture. It is now believed that this person has fled to Qingdao. According to reliable sources, this person is probably the actual shooter. Yesterday, when officials were asked about the case, they still did not know when the case would be publicly announced or why it was being kept secret. The Japanese authorities, like the concession authorities, have always kept this case secret. When the Continental Daily reporter went to inquire yesterday, they stated that they had forbidden all Japanese newspapers in Shanghai from publishing a single word about it.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Further Hearing in Nightclub Murder Case: Russian Demands Compensation for Medical Expenses, Further Interrogation Pending Investigation of Case <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Guo Zongwen from Guangdong had an altercation with Russian Mao Kaolao on September 28th of last year at the Metropolitan Dance Hall on Gordon Road due to the Russian woman Pao Pao Fu. As a result, Mao's arm was broken. It was settled through mediation, with Guo paying Mao a considerable amount of medical expenses, so the police did not prosecute the case. However, Mao has now commissioned lawyer Chen Daxun to send a letter to the legal department of the Municipal Council, requesting that Guo be prosecuted. After investigation by Chinese detective Tang Zihong of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the department filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court on charges of assault. A subpoena had already been issued. All the details have been recorded in the 17th issue of this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special Court held a criminal hearing. Guo and his lawyer appeared in court, and Mao Kaolao also appointed lawyer Chen to bring a civil suit, demanding compensation for medical and other expenses of 3,000 yuan. Mao Kaolao claimed that on that day, outside the Metropolitan Dance Hall, the defendant came forward and punched him in the back of his right arm, causing him to fall to the ground and break his arm. It has not yet recovered. The reason for the assault is unknown. His father then presented a statement outlining the calculation method for the civil suit. Guo stated that on that day, the plaintiff called him out to the Metropolitan Dance Hall, and then hit him. Because he was unreasonable, Guo was about to resist, but the plaintiff ran away, calling for help and accidentally falling down and getting injured. He did not injure him. Because he felt pity for him, he gave him 100 yuan for medical expenses at the time, but it did not mean that he admitted to injuring him. Judge Ye said that further investigation was needed, and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Kuang Zhongmou and Wife's Lawsuit: No Hope of Reconciliation, Zhang Shizhao's Best Efforts at Mediation Still Fail, Kuang's Wife's Harsh Conditions Difficult to Accept <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Kuang Zhongmou, owner of the Penglai Market, was sued by his stepwife, Kuang Zeng, to the Shanghai Local Court for failure to manage her savings. The court ruled that Kuang should pay his wife over 32,000 yuan, which is currently being enforced. However, Kuang was still dissatisfied and hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Peng Yuanxun, and Liu Guangyue to file a lawsuit based on the marital property system, arguing that the husband has the right to manage and benefit from the wife's property and that there is no need to execute the judgment. They requested a stay of execution and a retrial. Judge Han Zuoti held a hearing on the 13th of this month. Kuang Zhong spoke out about his hidden pain in court, and his situation was pitiful. Judge Han said that family lawsuits should be resolved through reconciliation, and advised both sides' lawyers to attempt reconciliation outside of court. On the 19th of this month, lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Peng Yuanxun, and Liu Guangyue visited Zeng at the Kuang residence to discuss reconciliation, but the reconciliation failed because Kuang's wife's conditions were too harsh. The lawyers drafted a record of the mediation and submitted it to the court for review. The reporter obtained the mediation record from lawyer Zhang Shizhao, which is summarized below: On the 19th of this month, the husband's lawyers, Zhang, Peng, and Liu, went to Kuang Lu at No. 88 Hejia Lane, Shangwen Road, to meet with Kuang Zeng and discuss reconciliation. Lawyer Zhang said first, "Mr. Kuang and Madam Kuang, we are here today under the court's order to mediate your marital lawsuit. As lawyers appointed by the court and responsible for mediation, it is our duty to make efforts. I think you have been married for many years and have many children. Why have disagreements? If you are determined to pursue the lawsuit, I would like to ask you to express a peaceful resolution and at the same time persuade Mr. Kuang to provide you with adequate financial compensation. As you know, during the existence of the marital relationship, the husband manages the joint property of the husband and wife according to law." Zeng replied, "I am afraid that it is not something that a few of you lawyers can discuss well. Our lawsuit has already reached this point." Lawyer Zhang said, "As long as there is sincerity and both parties do not insist on their own opinions, there is no reason why it cannot be discussed well. Please, Madam Kuang, propose your conditions so that we can all discuss them." Zeng then proposed the following conditions: 1. Mr. Kuang must be held responsible for canceling the marriage between his second son, Baozhen, and Cheng Meifang, and selecting a lady of equal status to his eldest son, Baoying's wife, for a remarriage. 2. Mr. Kuang must be held responsible for calling Xiao Tianbao, the inspector of the Penglai Market, to come before me, kneel down in front of me, and let me beat him to death alive. Mr. Kuang will be responsible for the consequences. 3. If Mr. Kuang wants to come back, he must give me a written statement in advance (i.e., write a confession) guaranteeing that he will no longer live outside and do other things that I consider wrong. 4. All of Mr. Kuang's property and economic rights must be completely handed over to me for joint management. I will manage all household expenses. Zeng also said, "If the above four conditions can be met, come and talk to me again. If they cannot be met, there is no need to come back."</p>

The robber with the knife searched the counter and robbed over 100 yuan in cash. They then escaped. Afterwards, the owner reported to the police station and requested that they be pursued.</p>

<p>Zhang Amai, 44 years old, from Pudong, used to work as a mason. Over ten years ago, he became involved with Zhang Xu, a woman from the same village. They lived together downstairs at No. 456 Kangti Road, Saqima Road, in the French Concession. However, Xu was fickle and also fell in love with Xu Daolin, 26 years old, from Pudong (also a mason), who lived upstairs in the same house. Zhang Amai found out about this and scolded Xu. Xu harbored resentment and conspired with Xu Daolin to kill Zhang. On the 21st evening, Zhang Amai returned home after work. After dinner, at 10:30 PM, Xu first poured a basin of boiling water all over Zhang's body. Zhang fell to the ground in extreme pain, and then Xu chopped Zhang in the back of the neck with a kitchen knife. Zhang resisted with his right hand, and his middle finger was also chopped off. At that time, Xu Daolin heard the sound and also entered the room to help commit the crime. People living in the same house heard the sound and went out to call the police. Only Xu Daolin was arrested, and Xu took the opportunity to escape. The injured man was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, Xu Daolin was sent to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer requested a postponement for further review. When questioned, Xu's confession was evasive. Judge Zhang ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled another review for the 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Zhang Yuanruo Discusses the Constitution Implementation Problem: His Early Advocacy for Adding Transitional Clauses; Implementing Constitutionalism is Key to China's Order and Disorder; Distribution and Implementation Should be Treated as Two Separate Issues; Difficulties in Implementation Should be Considered Before Promulgation <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of revising the draft constitution, central government figures have recently held frequent meetings, attracting considerable attention from various quarters. A reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang Yuanruo, a constitutional scholar and secretary of the municipal government, at his residence, and he shared his views on the issue of implementing constitutional government. His words were quite insightful, and are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang briefly stated that he had been paying attention to the issue of promulgating and implementing a constitution for some time. Last May, he drafted a special article published in major newspapers in response to Mr. Wu Jingxiong, the vice-chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, regarding how the constitution should be implemented and how temporary clauses should be established to seek remedies. He listed historical facts and specific clauses from the constitutional history of various countries and offered them to the authorities. Although his ideas were greatly appreciated in theory at the time, they were not adopted in practice. Now that Mr. Wang Liangchou has returned from overseas and the authorities are paying attention to this, I am deeply gratified.</p>
<p>Implementing constitutionalism is indeed an essential plan for a country's long-term stability and security. However, if implementation is not done properly, it can also lead to sources of turmoil. Since the founding of the Republic, the political situation has been turbulent, and the source of these troubles can invariably be traced back to constitutional issues. Therefore, the implementation of constitutionalism is a crucial key to China's order and disorder. Past events are a clear lesson.</p>
<p>In the past, the common ailment of those who discussed the constitution in our country was that they only paid attention to the "form" of the constitution and did not pay attention to its "use." They only engaged in the "dead" imitation of the clauses and did not emphasize the "living" application of constitutionalism. They did not understand that a constitution is a product of history and a reflection of the actual life of a nation. It cannot "walk on its own" and cannot be implemented effectively simply by being arbitrarily formulated. Therefore, the heart of today's constitutional problem lies not in the establishment and detail of the constitutional text and format, but in the flexibility and effectiveness of constitutional application. Now that the draft constitution has been finalized, of course it must be promulgated, but promulgation is one thing, and implementation is another. They should not be confused. If, in the process of promulgation and implementation, we can urgently seek sound transitional measures, then it will be like mending the fold after the sheep is lost, and things can still be done. Otherwise, if we leap over the necessary stages of historical evolution, and if implementation is ineffective or flawed, the ensuing turmoil will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Founding Outline and the arrangements for the publication and implementation of the constitution were quite prudent. One stated: "The draft constitution should be based on the Founding Outline and the achievements of both the tutelage and constitutional periods, and be deliberated by the Legislative Yuan, and publicized to the people at any time, in order to be selected and implemented when the time comes." The other stated: "When more than half of the provinces in the country have reached the constitutional period, that is, the period when provincial autonomy is fully established, a National Assembly shall be convened to decide on the constitution and promulgate it." According to the latter statement, the promulgation of the constitution and the convening of the National Assembly should both be premised on the completion of local self-government. According to the former statement, the deliberation of the constitution should be based on the actual achievements of political tutelage, and the implementation of the constitution should wait for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>This kind of approach is in line with the national conditions. Considering the norms and realities of constitutional government in various countries around the world, it is also not wrong. For example, in Finland and Poland, the implementation of their constitutions is separately regulated by law. In Siam, although the constitution is implemented from the date of promulgation, it is subject to temporary provisions. In Lithuania, the implementation of the constitution must be approved by a national referendum within ten years. In Prussia, only Articles 31-43 and 86 of the constitution became effective after promulgation; the remaining articles should be implemented after the new elections are completed. Even in England and France, the models of constitutional government, the implementation of the constitution was initially limited to a certain part, and was later supplemented and gradually perfected. The Chinese people's political capacity is still very weak, and the work of political tutelage is largely incomplete. At this time, the constitution must not only seek the completeness of the clauses, but also consider the various difficulties in practical application. All experienced statesmen should strive to avoid politeness, not sing high-sounding tunes, and seek a sound remedy for China's constitutional government. It is said that Mr. Zhang will have time in the next few days, and may draft another special article to contribute to the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Jin Youshan's Wife, Pan Jingwen, Proved by Forensic Doctor to Have No Mental Illness; The Prescriptions Opened by the Mental Hospital Were Still Appropriate; After Yesterday's Court Trial, Sentencing is Scheduled for Tomorrow <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mental Hospital on 888 Kangning Road, Shanghai, was founded by Gu Wensi and has been in operation for several years. Recently, the hospital, at the request of Jin Youshan, the Korean manager of the Jintuo Fountain Pen Factory on Changping Road, claimed that Jin's wife, Pan Jingwen, a woman from Tianjin, suffered from mental illness. Therefore, Pan was forcibly taken to the hospital by car, privately imprisoned, and assaulted. After the case was uncovered by the Gordon Road police, they filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court against the hospital's doctor, Chu Jiqun, male nurse Gao Xinkui, tea servant Li Amao, and Yang Caigou, for violating Article 302 and Article 277 of the Criminal Law. The case had been investigated by the court several times and had already concluded. However, because Judge Liu Yugui, who was presiding over the case, felt it necessary to determine whether Pan Jingwen actually had a mental illness and whether the prescriptions opened by the defendant Chu Jiqun were appropriate, he ordered the revocation of the debate and rescheduled the hearing. All these circumstances have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. First, Judge Qi announced that during the rescheduling of this case, the above two points had been separately reported to the court. According to the court's forensic report, Pan Jingwen had undergone a long and detailed examination to determine whether she had a mental illness. The result was that she was found to have no mental illness or loss of nerve function. Furthermore, the prescriptions opened by the defendant Chu Jiqun were also evaluated by the Shanghai National Medical Association and were deemed to be still appropriate. However, it could not be determined whether the symptom of "ascending of the Minister Fire" was definitely a manifestation of mental illness. Upon hearing this, Chu Jiqun immediately stated that the so-called "Minister Fire" was the rising of the liver and gallbladder fire, which irritated the nerves and was a symptom of mental illness. According to witness Gao Xizhong, who claimed to be a salesman at the Jintuo Fountain Pen Factory, the factory was indeed formerly run by Jin Youshan, but it has now been transferred. Pan Jingwen is Jin Youshan's wife. Although I often met her, I could not see that she had a mental illness. He also explained the situation of his contact with the mental hospital with Jin Youshan. According to Pan Jingwen, Jin Youshan is indeed Chinese, and Jin had recently published a notice in the newspaper with words that wantonly damaged my reputation. I hired lawyer Zhang Baotang to publish a rebuttal in the newspaper. Jin then sent a letter to lawyer Zhang threatening him, demanding a reply and apology within five days, or he would take appropriate measures. Therefore, regarding Jin Youshan's part, I request permission to retain the right to pursue further action, and I am submitting the newspaper as evidence. Finally, after the police lawyer and the defendant's lawyer debated each other, the court ordered that the defendants remain released on their original bail and await sentencing this Saturday.</p>

<p>Shengdan, a seasonal medicine of the Chinese product, has been on the market for more than ten years. It was developed by the Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company on Baker Road in this port. It dispels plagues and prevents epidemics, and brings the dead back to life. For those who have chest tightness, dizziness, drunk fainting, abdominal pain, vomiting, etc., taking only a few pills will immediately work. Therefore, those who have always used imported products have switched to using Shengdan. It is deeply trusted by all walks of life from far and near. In recent years, many military units have also adopted it. For example, recently, the Chengdu Office of the 36th Army in Sichuan, because there has been no large shipment of Shengdan to Sichuan this year and procurement is difficult, sent a special commissioner to Shanghai to directly purchase it from the Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company, which shows how popular it is. It is said that the company, in order to strive for domestic products, will sincerely treat those who purchase a large amount of products from the company with sincerity.</p>

Meng Xiangzhong, the shop's accountant, accidentally pushed it, causing the gun to fire and wound the apprentice Meng Caiyu, who was sent to Renji Hospital. It has now been learned that the apprentice died of his injuries at around 2:00 p.m. yesterday. However, it is learned that the deceased was Meng Xiangzhong's nephew. The reason why the militia member placed the rifle on the table was that he went out to relieve himself, which led to this unfortunate incident. At present, Meng Xiangzhong and Chuan Baoshan have both surrendered to the Xinzha Branch and requested a ruling. It is said that the bureau must wait for the local guarantor to report to the court for inspection today before making a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e159">New Development of China Oil Lamp Company <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>China Oil Lamp Company at 218 Shandong Road in this city specializes in manufacturing and selling plant oil lamps invented by Zhong. They are well-constructed and have beautiful styles. All kinds of plant oils produced in our country, such as rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, tung oil, tea oil, and cypress oil, can be burned. They emit bright light, better than kerosene lamps, without any smoke toxicity, and avoid fires. They can be said to be safe and hygienic, and also save oil (taking the local rapeseed oil as a standard, each four hours consumes the national currency one cent), which is in line with the needs of the general public in inland cities, towns, and villages. They have been tested by the Military Affairs Committee's camp, proving that they are indeed superior and economical to kerosene lamps, and have ordered their subordinate units to purchase them together. They have also been approved by the local governments of various provinces to be exempt from tax for sale. The company, due to the advent of oil lamps, plant oil has suddenly added a large sales channel, and is deeply afraid of affecting the original use, and has repeatedly approved the Ministry of Industry and the National Economic Commission to issue a notice to the country, widely planting seedling oil. The Ministry of Industry also sent letters to the construction departments of various provinces across the country, ordering the road management agencies to plant cypress trees along the roads to extract fuel. Recently, they have re-submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, ordering the Ministry of Interior and the National Economic Committee to issue a notice to the country, ordering that sesame be planted first on newly reclaimed land to enrich oil production. They have also obtained assistance from the China Agricultural Loan Group, which is composed of major banks, and the Anhui Provincial Local Bank to carry out oil seedling loans in various places. It is heard that the Jiangsu Farmers Bank has sent personnel to contact the company to discuss the issue of oil seedling loans, and a specific method has been determined, which will be implemented soon. In addition, the company's wind and rain lamps will be shipped next month. They are of excellent quality and beautiful style. The Chinese oil stove is also in the design and manufacture.</p>

<p>Cao Yingfu of Jiangyin is a veteran in the field of traditional Chinese medicine and has served as the director of teaching affairs at the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine College. He has devoted his life to the study of Zhongjing's learning, taking the "Treatise on Cold Damage" as the golden rule for treating diseases throughout the ages. Based on his 40 years of medical research and past clinical experience, he wrote the book "Revealing the Mysteries of Cold Damage," which has been widely acclaimed in the medical field. He also believes that Zhongjing's "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber" is actually intertwined with the "Treatise on Cold Damage" and is a book that must be read by those who study medicine. However, there are errors in transmission and writing, and there have been few successors since Xu You. The meaning is hidden and obscure, and practitioners suffer from it. Therefore, following the example of annotating the "Treatise on Cold Damage", he wrote the book "Gold Coffer Revealing the Mysteries" to correct errors, reveal the essence, and add clinical experience from previous years to each prescription, making the book "Gold Coffer" clear, transparent, and convenient for scholars. It is by no means superficial. Ding Jiwan, Bo Wei, Yi Ren, Xu Banlong, Chen Cunren and others have specially proofread and published it. The actual price of each book is three yuan, the reservation price is one yuan and five dimes, the deadline is the end of May. If you purchase it together with "Revealing the Mysteries of Cold Damage" during the reservation, you will only be charged half the original price, two yuan. The postage for each book to other places is two dimes and four cents. The reservation office is the Medical Bookstore at No. 204 Mayberg Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>Youthful Life</p>
<h3 id="e166">Sweeping Away Neurasthenia That Ruins the Happiness of Youth <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Regardless of gender, everyone must go through a period of youth in their life. This period is of great importance and has a significant impact on a person's health and happiness throughout their life. Young men and women! I hope you will recognize your responsibility for the future and have a healthy body and a brave spirit—striving to make progress. This is what makes a good man! Do not take this period of youth lightly and fall into bad habits such as masturbation, which injures the body, damages the nerves, and leads to mental listlessness, forming a neurasthenic invalid who is "useless alive and harmless dead"!</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is a disease that is prone to occur among young men and women, so it is also called the youth disease. Millions of young people in society are poisoned by it and moan in a life of misery. It turns promising young people into pitiful and useless cripples, and the happiness of life is completely lost. What a terrible disease this is!</p>
<p>The symptoms of neurasthenia are generally: feeling dizzy and having headaches all day, lacking vitality, being anxious, thinking slowly, having memory loss, having short-sightedness, lacking courage and decisiveness, having weak limbs, having a sore back and waist, feeling depressed, having nightmares and difficulty sleeping, having stomach bloating and chest pain, having indigestion, and having a haggard face. Although in the prime of life, they already show signs of old age.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is not an incurable disease. If patients pay attention to recuperation, live a regulated life, give up bad habits of masturbation, avoid overexertion of body and mind, and do not use stimulating foods, taking "Memory Neurotic" internally can restore the vitality of the weakened nerves, making them lively and energetic. Then, the above-mentioned symptoms will disappear quickly, turning weakness into strength, and they can enjoy the benefits of life again!</p>
<p>Young people! You must know that the national crisis is deepening day by day. The future national glory, the future national revival, and the future welfare of the country and the nation—this very heavy and difficult task is placed on your shoulders. Everyone must pay attention!</p>
<h3 id="e167">What Young Women Should Know — Healthy Body and Mind — <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Yueyuan</p>
<p>A sign of a woman's health and beauty that everyone knows is menstruation. If menstruation comes regularly and repeats on time, then the general function of the body is likely not in any abnormal state. At the same time, you can know that her body is not undergoing any major changes. Naturally, she is healthy and energetic.</p>
<p>Normal menstruation indicates the soundness of a woman's body. If menstruation is irregular, this indicates that a woman's body is weak. Therefore, menstruation is a measurement of a woman's health. Every time I see young women with pale complexions, depressed spirits, and weak bodies, after examination and inquiry, nine out of ten are due to abnormalities in menstruation.</p>
<p>The symptoms caused by menstrual irregularities are generally: pain before and after menstruation, bleeding, and various other discharges—leukorrhea—most of the time feeling distension and pain in the lower abdomen and waist, as well as headaches, insomnia, shoulder pain, palpitations, loss of appetite, nausea, constipation, excessive urination, sometimes with pain. In addition, there may be dizziness, fatigue, numbness, swelling, feeling bloated, general lethargy, weak sexuality, and pain during intercourse. It varies from person to person. The details of these symptoms can be known from the patient's own description, and there are indeed quite a few.</p>
<p>The tragic state of young women suffering from menstrual disorders is truly unspeakable. It destroys the beautiful dreams of couples and causes disharmony in the family. Because of mental distress, the happiness of youthful health and beauty is completely eroded by this menstrual pain. How unfortunate! Therefore, menstrual disorders must be treated appropriately as early as possible, and attention must be paid to recuperation. Do not underestimate or neglect them.</p>
<p>Patients must calm their minds, avoid all kinds of stimulation, cultivate their body and mind, and absolutely avoid overwork. If it is due to blood deficiency, they must eat more nourishing foods or take "Kang's Life" to nourish the blood and quickly restore their physical strength.</p>
<p>As for menstrual regulating medications, the most effective one clinically is "Menorrin." This is unanimously recommended by specialized physicians in various countries. In recent years, I have used this product to treat gynecological diseases—menstrual irregularities—red and white leukorrhea—and other symptoms, and I have achieved satisfactory results. All the suffering of women is dispelled in a very short period of time, restoring the joy of health and beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Kang's Vitality Essence is the Only Good Shortcut for Nutritional Therapy for Lung Disease <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shengzhang</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is a chronic disease that most easily consumes physical strength, and if the body is weak, the ability to resist the virus will also be weakened, and the disease will become even more severe. Therefore, the supply of nutrients is essential in treatment. Good nutrition and strong physical strength can resist tuberculosis bacteria and promote the healing of the disease.</p>
<p>Human life depends entirely on nutrition, and the essence of lung disease patients has been depleted by tuberculosis bacteria, so the supply of nutrition is especially important and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Although the nutrients we need can be obtained from food and drink, the stomach and intestines of lung disease patients are weak, and they often experience loss of appetite and indigestion. Even if there are abundant nutrients in food, they cannot be fully absorbed, and the result is still excretion in the stool without any benefit. Therefore, the nutritional value of food is not entirely reliable for lung disease, and artificial tonics should be added in addition to diet to make up for deficiencies.</p>
<p>According to clinical reports from various doctors, for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, in addition to taking "Phith Weal" for fundamental treatment, taking "Kang's Life Essence" Conbour's San-Vita-Cell at the same time to supplement their nutrition is the only good shortcut to accelerate the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>"Kang's Life Essence Conour's San-Vila Cel is made from precious tonics such as Amino Acid, Yita-Min, etc., which are essential elements for human life. Its effect is to encourage cells to promote metabolism and make the whole body energetic, increase the secretion of digestive juices to help food digestion, directly nourish the human body, create blood and build muscles, and strengthen all life functions of the human body. Its ability to resist disease is undoubtedly powerful. Therefore, whether based on theory or fact, it has been proven to be an invaluable tonic. Moreover, it is extremely pure and has no side effects. It is suitable for taking in both winter and summer. For those suffering from weakness and physical deficiency, regular consumption of this product to replenish blood, strengthen essence, strengthen the brain, and improve intelligence has great effects. As an adjunct to nutritional therapy for lung disease, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort, making it a wise choice to prioritize light burdens and heavy benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Thorough Treatment of Lung Disease Need Not Be Sought Far Away <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Shengzhang</p>
<p>Economic treatment at home is the wisest method Taking "Phith Weal" is an extremely rational treatment</p>
<p>For thorough treatment of lung disease, it is not necessary to relocate for treatment. Climate and air are not directly effective for lung disease. The fundamental treatment lies in reforming life, that is, for those receiving treatment at home, if they can strictly adhere to hygiene practices such as air, quiet, and nutrition, and appropriate medication treatment, perfect results can also be obtained.</p>
<p>Lung disease is a chronic condition. To achieve recovery, the treatment period needs to be extremely long, taking up time and causing unemployment, and the financial cost is enormous. Therefore, patients must have a plan to support the long term, which is the wisest method. If the patient's family is not very wealthy, such as when receiving treatment at home, it is only necessary to slightly modify the structure of their residence (to make it suitable for air therapy), pay attention to general hygiene, and take the truly effective "Phith Weal" (this product can assist the body's natural healing functions). The results obtained are superior to those of relocating for treatment.</p>
<p>Those receiving treatment at home can live a carefree and peaceful life because it does not require much expense. Even in terms of food and nursing, the family is more free and comfortable, which is definitely not possible in a hospital or when relocated. Therefore, would it not be more comfortable to receive long-term economic treatment at home? Moreover, this method is suitable for the lives of the masses, and anyone can easily implement it. Therefore, the thorough treatment of lung disease can only be achieved through home treatment, and it is not necessary to seek it far away.</p>
<p>Patients must know that receiving long-term economic treatment at home, adhering to air, quiet, nutrition, and other therapies, and taking "Phith Weal" is the secret to the thorough treatment of lung disease. If they do not understand this principle and abandon the near for the far, running around aimlessly, thinking that they can cure the disease simply by relocating, they are actually constantly destroying the dikes of the lung lesions, causing the disease to spread to the entire lung. I have seen many cases where the condition worsened or life was lost due to relocation. This is because they do not know the fundamentals of treatment, do not know the importance of quiet treatment, and should have been lying down and not moving, but now they are making the body travel and toil. How can the disease not progress?</p>

Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday Twelve Team Members Led by Zhou Jiaqi Arrive in Shanghai First Li Huitang Arrives in Port in the Afternoon by China Aviation Flight from Guangzhou <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Our World Games soccer team, a group of twelve people including Bao Jiaping, etc., led by Zhou Jiaqi, arrived in Shanghai first on the Boston wheel from Hong Kong. The wheel arrived in port at noon yesterday, docking at the Gonghexing Wharf. Shen Siliang, etc., from the Sports Association all went to welcome them. Li Huitang, the captain of the World Games soccer team, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon by China Aviation flight. All the team members are staying at the Delin Apartments. In addition, Cao Guicheng, etc., arrived in Shanghai on the Shipping Merchants' Hai Zhen wheel from Hong Kong the day before. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Port Yesterday The World Games soccer team, led by Zhou Jiaqi, arrived in Shanghai on the German wheel Boston at around 12:00 noon yesterday. The ship docked at the Gonghexing Wharf, etc. After the team members slightly tidied up their luggage, they disembarked at 12:30. Those who came to welcome them included Shen Siliang, the general secretary of the Sports Association, Rong Qizhao of the World Games selection committee, and dozens of relatives and friends of the team members. The group that arrived in Shanghai yesterday included Bao Jiaping, Zhuo Shijin, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Liang Rongzhao, Chen Zhenhe, Li Guowei, Ye Beihua, Huang Meishun, Jia Youliang, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi, etc., a total of twelve people. Except for Chen Zhenhe and Jia Youliang, who returned to their private residences, the other ten all stayed at the Delin Apartments.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Compete As for team captain Li Huitang, due to work reasons, he was unable to travel with the entire team. He took a China Aviation flight north yesterday morning and arrived at Longhua Airport at around 5:00 PM, staying at No. 210 Delin Apartments. The other representatives, Cao Guicheng, Liang Shutang, Zhang Xianyuan, Zheng Jiliang, and Sun Jinshun, also left Hong Kong on the Shipping Merchants' Hai Zhen wheel on the 22nd and will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. Selection committee member Yan Chengkun also came to Shanghai on the same wheel. Team manager Huang Jiajun will board the ship with team members Huang Jiliang, Xu Yahui, and Mai Shaohan in Hong Kong when the entire team goes abroad. The matches that this representative team will play in Shanghai are scheduled to take place as planned.</p>
<p>Zhou Jiaqi Talks According to Zhou Jiaqi, the representative of Shen, who went to Hong Kong to preside over the selection matters, the selection process went very smoothly. Moreover, because the selectors focused on individual skills and were not swayed by past reputations, everything was open. Therefore, the participating players played very hard. The performance of Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, Li Guowei, etc., has improved rapidly. Feng Jingxiang is a rare center forward talent with extremely refined skills. After the official representative team was announced, public opinion expressed satisfaction. The rumors of inside decisions in the past have also been disproven. As for the overall strength of the team, it can be seen in the match against the Hong Kong Western Union on the 19th. The strength of the Hong Kong Western Union is far superior to that of the Shanghai Western Union. All the team members are outstanding. It is not easy for our representative team to score seven to one in seventy minutes. Our representative team's defense line is the strongest and flawless. The forwards are sharp.

<p>——Short Sellers Were at a Disadvantage and Covered Their Positions——</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market situation was such that as the settlement period approached, short sellers were at a disadvantage due to the legal tender policy for this month. Floating shorts had to cover, forming a squeeze, and the upward trend continued to be strong. Class A bonds reached a new high price of 67 yuan. The highest record for Class B bonds will gradually approach after trading is suspended, and its true extent will then be seen. Judging from yesterday's enthusiastic release of No. 48, it failed to suppress the small market, which shows the firmness of the long positions this month. Today is the last trading day for futures this month, and there will be another fierce competition. Yesterday's events: The market opened in the morning, and No. 10 bought quite a bit, and the market price unanimously continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. Most of them were firmer for this month's futures. In the next session, No. 4 covered, and Class D bonds for this month, about 200,000, were raised by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. Class A and B bonds for this month were slightly soft by 0.05 yuan due to swap relations. In the afternoon, No. 48 sold Class E bonds for this month very enthusiastically. Although No. 4 and No. 35, etc. bought, it only slightly retreated by 0.15 yuan. After that, it rose again by 0.4 yuan. Although No. 11 and No. 16 sold, the demand was ultimately greater than the supply, and Class A bonds reached a new high price. The close was slightly chaotic. Although No. 16 still sold, the Class D and B bonds for this month, due to the excessive increase, caused the long positions to swap, and retreated slightly by about 0.1 yuan. The rest still recovered by about 0.1 yuan. In summary, the market price unanimously continued to rise by 0.2 to 0.6 yuan. The total number of transactions was 6,645,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are listed below (unit: 100 yuan per transaction unit)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yarn market, which had fallen sharply the day before, turned to a high rise.

<p>Call Yarn Buying Was Particularly Strong</p>
<p>The call yarn market opened in the morning, with the extremely strong virtual phoenix of the previous day, and near months continuing to be sluggish, falling 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. When auctioned to distant months, bulls suddenly came to strenuously add positions, and Dachangcheng, Xincheng, Jinchang, Dafu, etc. all bought together, and the market stabilized. After the second session, buying was particularly strong, and supply could not keep up, and market prices advanced step by step. Each month turned from weak to strong, and the results all rose 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 yuan to 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, the floating chips from the previous market had been almost completely collected, and near months were tighter. However, general colleagues tended to sell short because yarn sales were not smooth and warehouse stockpiles exceeded 30,000 bales, and their power was also strong. As a result, near months rose 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and distant months did not move.

<p>The Call Cotton Aftermarket Was Firm</p>
<p>The call cotton market opened in the morning, and because there were only two days of business left in this month, and the short sellers were delivering enthusiastically, the pressure was also heavy, and people's hearts were normal. Near months all fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. When auctioned to distant months, it turned firm, because the bulls came again to resist fiercely. Dachangcheng, Yuanyi, Jinchang, and Dafu all came back to drag in, and the panic was curbed. After the second session, each month turned upward, and the results all rose 0.1 to 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price.

Western satin and Yuan velvet Zhigong woolens slightly increased. Poplin feather satin had ups and downs.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, presented a near-stable and far-weak trend. Foreign wheat quotations: Chicago rose by 0.2-0.4, Canada rose by 0.48. People's hearts in the market were naturally stable because the chips in this month were not abundant. Because the weather has been clear and the climate is very good since June, industry insiders and outsiders have been uniformly weak. It is said that this year's wheat seedlings in various places are developing smoothly, and there is a slight movement, which is also its own cause. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the shorts were covering their positions in this month, and it rose slightly again. In the distant months, trading shifted, and the market trended flat and weak. According to the recent situation, the new wheat must be harvested, and there is certainty. Buyers and sellers have regular rules to follow.</p>

<p>Yesterday the period wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed a softening trend in all months. Due to the good weather, the wheat seedlings have been favorably influenced. Although sellers in the market hesitated and sold, prices turned soft as conditions improved. Compared to the previous day, it fell by two to three points. Trading became lively in the afternoon and the price slightly softened. The weather is favorable, so the price may continue to soften. The spot wheat remained steady. The price of Shandong Yaowan wheat was five yuan and three corners, and Fuxin Shen bought eight hundred bags. In addition, more than 17000 tons of Sydney wheat arrived.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, each gang had more than twenty sources, with a total of more than four thousand names. The sales market remained sluggish, so the price of thick early japonica rice fell by several points to near angles. However, the package appetite of thin rice was due to rumors in Jiangsu Province of a ban. The helping from Beijing, Yantai, and Weihaiwei helped handle more than four thousand bags, so the market for thin rice was able to bid higher by several points. Du Yangjian was soft, and Yin Bianyuan was flat.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were thirty boats from various roads under the river. Due to the clear weather and rumors of a halt to transshipments, sales of goods on the market were weaker and acceptance was slow. The market price of white japonica fell about a corner. The price of early rice followed by a small number of points, and the price of high-quality thin rice was a small four to five points. The price of middle and secondary rice was close to a corner, the price of Yin Yuan was a small number of points, the sales of white Yuan was sluggish and the price was reduced outside the corner. The price of Yang Jian was a small seven to eight points, the price of Du Bujian was fatigued, the price of E Jian was fatigued by three to four points, and the other goods were all fatigued.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Shantou Telecommunications reported that because the exchange rate continued to fall by 20 yuan, it had reached 1,130 yuan. The price of each refined product had invisibly increased, so the trend gradually stabilized. Yesterday's telephone mentioned that Qing was 11.5 yuan, followed by 11.25 and 10.2 yuan. Shangzhiyang was 15 yuan. The Shanghai market number plate was still not open due to the observation of the firm side. The trend seemed difficult to pass. Xinghua Dagong Bai was called for 18 yuan and was not traded. Other miscellaneous red and white sugars were flat and tired because they received less. Because Qing Yuan Lun imported yesterday, more than 4,000 bags of Hainan Red continued to arrive. It was appropriate for the sales market to be indifferent, and there was a sign of falling again.</p>
<p>The trade association’s disk trades were all tired, without a little spirit. If two four coarse sand white and Dong red white book cotton white etc. are rarely moved, only the transshipment of Dong White No. 4 is 6.8 yuan and No. 8 is 6.45 yuan, which is a continuation of a small five points compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>According to Lanxi News, the stock of white lotus is gradually becoming scarce recently, the high-quality goods have reached 78 yuan, and the second-best goods are slightly reduced, and the pads are very firm. Although the sales in this area are not many, the stock is also not thick, so the asking price has risen by two or three yuan compared to before. The top white lotus was called for 85 yuan yesterday, but was not traded.</p>
<p>Since the price of Shantou Tangerine Cake has risen, some have been transported. Yesterday it was heard that it has been opened and risen by one yuan compared to before, and the market disk followed suit. However, Xiamen, Wenzhou, and other goods were still tired due to sluggish sales. The Wenzhou cake market disk was half a yuan less than before, and the Tangerine Cake number plate was not opened because it received less.</p>
<p>Lily Slices have not been available for delivery recently, and the stock on the market is abnormally scarce. It has been found that the entire city has only about 10 to 20 pieces in total, so the market disk still insists on 32 yuan, and it is heard that a certain merchant still has a dozen pieces stored in the place of origin, and they have not been immediately shipped to Shanghai. They must wait for the Shanghai market to rise again, hoping to get a good price. It is estimated that the period for new deliveries is still far away, and it is predicted that it will not be able to pick up the new one.</p>

<p>(Dried Shrimp) The new listing must wait between July and August. The stored old goods have already been sold through. Currently, foreign merchants need to buy goods from the local Nanhua shops.

Nanhua stores see that there is a heavy profit to be made, so they are happy to return the goods, otherwise, there will be a risk of stockouts.</p>
<p>(Crab Roe) The new season is even more delayed, but the production is quite extensive. Such places as Ningbo, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and Jiangbei all have sources. In addition, the number of needs in various places is not half that of dried shrimp. It has been found that there are currently 30-40 loads in stock, which can be guaranteed to have no shortage until the new goods are released.

<p>This time, the tea transport in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces is regulated. Members of the provincial government were previously sent to the mountains to handle registration and grant loans. At that time, most of the owners were half willing and half reluctant because they had already received Shanghai Stack Loans. Now the situation has taken a sharp turn. The hundreds of tea factories in the three locations of Qimen Fulang and Zhide have already fully accepted the registration, and the association has released more than 1.2 million yuan. It is reported that the province has now stipulated that the number of Qimen teas transported to foreign villages this year is 60,000 boxes, in order to seek an average in supply and demand. The tea industry on the road has been completely under the control of the association.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Enchantment <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>It wasn't even a few hours since Fourth Sister, who people called "Thief Woman," returned to her village when everyone knew.</p>
<p>Her face, plump and vigorous like a bun, her stout body, and the silk clothes, gold bracelets, watch, and real stone rings incongruously adorning her, had appeared so often in people's eyes that their intense curiosity slowly faded. Though the women still acted warmly towards her when they met, appearing to listen intently to her lengthy words mixed with incorrect provincial accents and newfangled terms.</p>
<p>I hadn't forgotten the last time Fourth Sister returned home. One of my distant aunts, with many frivolous words and excessive laughter, kept Fourth Sister company for over half an hour. But as Fourth Sister turned to leave, she pursed her lips and said with utter contempt:</p>
<p>"That free woman, hmm, that thief woman, could she even raise a son with a bottom? The things she wears, I wonder from whose house she stole them…"</p>
<p>I asked my aunt at the time: "But weren't you just acting differently towards her?"</p>
<p>Offended by my question, she didn't answer. She just turned back and widened her eyes as she left, saying:</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, this is teaching you how to behave!"</p>
<p>I ran into Fourth Sister on the third morning after her return.</p>
<p>"Let's go have tea, let's go to Shun Yu Lou for tea," she urged. Her short, sturdy figure leaned against the iron railing of Wenlan Bridge. The morning breeze ruffled her carelessly styled hair; her arms, though short, moved nimbly; her speech was filled with a shallow boldness. Combining all her bold, brash, fierce, childlike straightforwardness— such a character was hard to find in the village. The urgency of her speech, the restless darting of her eyes, and the agile turning of her head and hands all showed that she was accustomed to that kind of adventurous, fluid life.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of men there," I disagreed.</p>
<p>"Forget it, what's the big deal! Even a schoolgirl acts so prissy. My son is a man too," she said, laughing loudly and slapping my shoulder hard. According to her, she puffed out her chest, swinging her arms, her face as if facing a close friend every minute, and bought a big bag of buns from Shunxing Lou and came back.</p>
<p>We crossed Wenlan Bridge and entered Qili Pavilion, across from the mulberry fields. She ate and spoke non-stop, saying things that tasted like nothing to me. Later, she changed her approach, pointing to her gold jewelry, explaining in detail which styles were now the most popular in Shanghai, and which stones were worth more than others.</p>
<p>"Alas, I'm still missing a top-quality diamond, I love it the most! What about you, what do you love the most? Let's talk about what I'm wearing."</p>
<p>"None of this can bring you glory. The whole village looks down on you!"</p>
<p>The sun revealed half its body, and the surroundings slowly became hot. The mulberry trees gently trembled, bracing themselves to resist the sun's fiery power. I felt uneasy; what should I say to Fourth Sister at this moment? She didn't seem to understand what I said; she looked at me and laughed loudly. After a long silence, she defended herself:</p>
<p>"When I worked in the silk factory, no one ever looked up to me either. People seemed to never have time to talk to me!—But now they actually… Alas, did I steal these things for nothing?" She played with her ornaments again, just like a child with their toys, not out of necessity but for pleasure.</p>
<p>Her stubbornness annoyed me, so I simplified my meaning and said, "I'm talking about a person's character! If a person's soul is stained, then even gold plating cannot hide it!"</p>
<p>"Oh, character, right, I also heard that term when I was in the provincial capital. Ah Ming, you've been to school for two years, so maybe you understand more; but since a person ultimately has to eat, in this world, as long as you show your courage, show your strength, and show your ideas, then isn't he a person of character? Hmm, character is not like money, hidden away by people; whoever wants it can just take it, I won't wait for others to give it to me, nor will I steal it from others, right, haha…" To explain her point, her hands and features became even more active, talking non-stop, as if not willing to relax my attention for a moment. "It's all just about the problem of eating. What's the difference?—Picking mulberry leaves, sorting cocoons, reeling silk, being a prostitute, being a robber… You name it, you pick out one of these careers that is more noble! You know, a person often encounters times when 'you're not allowed to choose.' …As for tomorrow, I don't care about that, I don't even know what morality or law is; even knowing that I'll kick the bucket tomorrow, I'm not willing to starve today! I only know that I want to live, I only know that I want to find a bowl of rice to eat!…" Her buttocks suddenly left the stone stool, and she jumped around in the pavilion, yelling.</p>
<p>She looked a bit excited, but she was always so cheerful and confident, as if there was nothing terrible or scary in her mind. She still jumped around anxiously, like an ant on a hot pot, constantly cursing the hot weather, and using her hand as a fan.</p>
<p>"Only knowing how to live—that's right, but you should know how to live properly. Some ways of living will destroy our souls…!"</p>
<p>She seemed unwilling for me to continue, interrupting me with her words.</p>
<p>"Hey, you're about to become a female teacher, right? But I'm not even qualified to be your student. How can I get through such hot weather? I've only been back for two days, and I'm already getting bored again, I can't live such a stable life anymore. I'm going back to Tengchong tomorrow, maybe even today, alas!…"</p>
<p>For some small reason, she left Qili Pavilion like a grasshopper. I stayed in the pavilion alone for a long time, thinking about this enchanting woman.</p>
<h3 id="e221">"In the Beginning was the Deed" <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Li Bo</p>
<p>—Thoughts after Reading Goethe's "Faust"—</p>
<p>In his study, Doctor Faust, "yearning for life's rivers, desperately longing for life's source," was again struggling with the anxieties of life's thirst. To remedy the emptiness and deficiencies in his life, he opened the Hebrew Bible, hoping to find some "noble and beautiful" revelations within. He translated the phrase "In the beginning was the Word," but felt that the word "Word" was unclear, and translated it again as "In the beginning was the Mind." But "Mind" cannot create the universe, so he finally decided to write it as "In the beginning was the Power." Still feeling it was inappropriate, he finally, with "divine penmanship," translated the first sentence of the "Gospel of John" as "In the beginning was the Deed" (In the beginning was the deed). He laughed with joy.</p>
<p>Regardless of how "Faust" develops later, this is truly a "noble and beautiful" revelation.</p>
<p>What will not fade with time are the books written by life. The most valuable are the words containing actions, that is, the words accumulated from actions. In the world, there are many literati who idly play with words behind colored gauze windows, and there are also pedantic scholars who spend their entire lives caressing dwarf corruptions detached from life and gleefully congratulating themselves, but when they see the dazzling light of life, they will all turn withered or pale.</p>
<p>Knowing a few words can also allow one to learn some practical theories and copy fragments of ideologies. But when the storms of life arrive, it will make people feel regret even more. The ideologies that were originally foreign to his life will be buried or ruined by him; the progress of his life will ultimately follow his own animal-level interests and psychology. And that second-handed ideology will reveal the flaws between it and life, or even be completely abandoned, or, like a faded fallen leaf in a strong wind, detached from the branch of life, still trying to struggle in mid-air, but will eventually drift into some muddy swamp.</p>
<p>Moreover, even fragmentary parroting and artificial patching are not easy. Besides pure theory, how many prejudices and biases might be inherited! What best disinfects all these toxins, other than action? This society is full of lies. What do we use to prevent the spread of lies, other than action?</p>
<p>The value of theory lies in the fact that it extracts and organizes the experiences of human behavior in the historical movement of reality, and then acts upon the historical movement of reality again. The historical movement of reality is subtle and ever-changing. Once theory leaves it, it will make mistakes, or even become empty and useless.</p>
<p>The civilization of modern European bourgeois society has nurtured writers like James Joyce and Marcel Proust. Joyce's eyes are always fixed on the many dung heaps of human reality. His works have only so many vulgar photos, without any poetic temperament. The great realist Balzac seemed to have said that being able to discover the poetic elements in reality is half of a person's genius. However, in the declining bourgeois society, it is impossible to produce this kind of genius with poetic temperament. Marcel Proust lies in a magnificent salon, looking at the ceiling every day. What does he write? The ceiling is the same every day? How monotonous and tasteless his reality is. Thus, we see another deformed phenomenon in modern literature: next to the ever-changing social reality, there are gentlemen like Proust who are too full, avoiding reality and emanating a pitiful "whisper of dreams" (Gorky's words).</p>
<p>Goethe, an artistic thinker, once pointed out that literature should be a mixture of poetry and truth. Bourgeois society cannot produce great poets, nor does it have faithful authors who depict the social reality truthfully. The analysis of dung and the "whisper of dreams" have become the great boast of their entire literature.</p>
<p>Our country's realists have had an inextricable connection with social movements from the very beginning. However, at present, a part of the literati seems to have a vague tendency to be tired of social life and to despise the current actual movement of the entire nation. What is the future of this tendency? Our country does not even have the conditions for producing the art of Proust and Joyce. If there are people who have the same tendency as their empty lives, then he will, at most, become an unsuccessful Proust, or a weaker and smaller Joyce.</p>
<p>We demand writers with rich knowledge of reality and an exciting spirit of poetry. We demand that writers, for the sake of their own artistic achievement, and also for the sake of the Chinese nation and its cultural future, more passionately love and penetrate the current struggling reality movement. We must follow Hegel's immortal instruction: To have the greatest concern for world history, for the entire society. Our theme should be the necessary action of the world and humanity described under this concern.</p>
<p>All great writers are like this. They experience rich practical life, and love it passionately all their lives. Gorky, Barbusse, Romain Rolland, Gide, their joys and sorrows are mostly the expression of social emotions that care about human history, and their intellect is the intellect of a warrior in the historical movement.</p>
<p>All great theorists are constantly washing their theories on the torrent of the reality movement. This guarantees that their theories will always be fresh, healthy, rich, and powerful. "Let the storm and rain blow more fiercely!" Our greatest poet wrote the famous lines of poetry. How passionately did that genius theorist repeatedly savor them, when he was writing brilliant guiding theories.</p>
<p>Now the storm and rain of the Chinese nation's people's liberation is already fierce enough. What an opportune time for us, writers and theorists! Let us also sing the song of the flying birds welcoming the wind and rain! Or let us bring up the verse of the erudite Faust who admired life:</p>
<p>I think that this is what it means to be a happy person,</p>
<p>Or to die on the battlefield wearing a crown stained with blood,</p>
<p>Or to hold a girl in one's arms after the dance,</p>
<p>If our girls are also about to become slaves, then we will more decisively love the first two lines of poetry, right?</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>A desolate road suddenly became lively. The sidewalk outside the Tiancheng Printing House was crowded with men and women of various appearances.</p>
<p>Everyone seemed lost and bewildered: their sallow and gloomy faces, thick black eyebrows covered in ash, bright, green-tinged eyes, and purplish-gray lips that moved slightly, as if wanting to say something but not quite managing it.</p>
<p>"Oh! Huh!"</p>
<p>Someone sighed, as if understanding what was happening. Others immediately followed suit, yawning one after another, as if infected:</p>
<p>"Oh! Huh!"</p>
<p>The central door of the Tiancheng Printing House was open, but the shutters on the glass windows on either side had not yet been removed. People poured in like a black current through the doorway. The small printing room had a counter on the left and a lithographic press on the right. Against the back wall was a bed. It was all extremely simple. No one could tell who the owner was, and they glared at each other with green eyes. Only a middle-aged woman, with a pale, gourd-shaped face, stood facing outward in front of the bed. So, everyone squeezing inside focused their gaze on her, but brought their mouths close to the ears of strangers, looking at the grime behind their ears, smelling the oily odor of their hair, and asking each other, "What's going on?"</p>
<p>Before they could finish speaking, it seemed someone leaned in close, as if listening to mosquitoes buzzing while lying in bed: "Stole…stole…"</p>
<p>A woman immediately blushed red. She scratched her short-cropped hair, looking at the woman standing in front of the bed. She thought, "What could a woman steal?" Her whole body felt hot. She looked at the woman again, and her face strangely transformed into the face of that lovely man she had secretly met behind her husband's back. She thought, "People are really strange things. Which woman is ever completely satisfied with her husband for a lifetime? Who hasn't done something immoral!" "Ugh!" So, as if to calm herself, she coughed once. "Why—why is everyone so crowded!" she cried again, elbowing someone in the stomach, trying to push her way out.</p>
<p>The person she hit was a large man. His pumpkin-like face and fat neck trembled from the impact. He looked at the shouting woman, whose square, blocky ears were adorned with earrings. "Damn!" he thought. "Pretty good lookin'. Just yesterday, used my wife's old earrings to pawn, ate a bellyful of good food, came home and my wife was half-dead from crying and raising hell: shouting 'thief!' and 'you old devil! How could you steal even the last bit of my property!' Damn it! That stupid woman doesn't know how valuable money is these days. There are foreigners who collect silver; if I pawn things now, I can drink even more!" "Heh heh heh! If the world doesn't let me drink yellow wine, how else am I supposed to live?..." And then a line of drool ran down the big man's mouth. Following this, he sneezed: "Ah choo!"</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" A pretty female student turned her face. Her eyebrows were finely drawn in a gentle curve and her rosy cheeks were dusted with a large patch of waxy rouge. She tugged at the arm of her Western-suited male classmate, feigning a look of being bullied. "Let's go out! Let's go out!" But the man, with his messy long hair, looked at the gourd-faced woman through his glasses as if an artist sketching a model, ignoring the female student's urging. The woman grew angry, pouting her delicate little mouth, wriggled her buttocks through the tightly packed legs, and forced her way out, as if muttering to herself, "You old thief! You knew how to steal my kisses in the park, but now you are so absorbed looking at that gourd-face, are you planning to steal her love?"</p>
<p>The man suddenly felt a space open up on his left. He turned to see a head that looked like a bird’s nest, moving outward through the crowd. He immediately turned around within the forest of legs, tracking and catching up in a straight line, completely disregarding the astonished faces to his left and right and the voices near his ears asking "What was stolen? Who’s the thief?", his eyes fixed intently on that bird’s nest head. Once outside on the sidewalk, he grabbed the female student’s left arm and asked, “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” the woman turned her left corner of her mouth upward. “Someone sneezed on the back of my head and you didn’t even notice!” But then, feeling the warmth of the man’s hand holding her left arm, she changed her mind, asking in an angry tone: "What exactly was stolen?"</p>
<p>"Maybe a man, maybe something else! Who cares!" the man said in a tender tone. Then, he suddenly remembered that he was a university student, and added, "Even our land has been stolen, thousands of miles of it! We can't even control that. Why are we even bothering to worry about a petty thief!" As he spoke, he pushed aside the groups of people gathered on the sidewalk, and walked south, arm in arm.</p>
<p>A policeman in a white hat came towards them. He seemed to have overheard some of what the university student had said. When he reached the entrance of the Tiancheng Printing House, he waved his hands, dispersing the crowd. But as he did so, he also spoke to the crowd, as if telling them not to leave and to listen to his explanation.</p>
<p>"What's so interesting here? The thief has already been caught. It’s a boss and his two employees. —Look! Look! They stole rice from that rice shop!" As he spoke, the hand dispersing the crowd pointed to a small rice shop across the street.</p>
<p>In the crowd, a skinny, short man with an oily face used his greasy, blackened apron to wipe the sweat that had suddenly broken out on his forehead. "Rice! Rice! Oh, damn it! The rice shop owner's rice should be stolen. We restaurant owners suffer because they raise rice prices. If—if—I had known he could steal rice, then, we could have gotten some cheap goods, being on the same street—"</p>
<p>"Stole eleven bags—stole eleven bags!" the policeman continued relentlessly. He seemed to have become interested in the rice theft; he completely sympathized with the thief's superior technique. He said, "Think about it, there are plenty of us patrolling on this street, and he still managed to break in and steal eleven bags! People will hear this and think he's working with us! —Hmm! —Cough!" As he spoke, he suddenly coughed in embarrassment. At this moment, the people inside and outside the door began to mingle. Those who knew it was about stolen rice all felt a little regret in their hearts: "How did he get caught? Alas! If I could have gotten a bag, that would have been so good!"</p>
<p>"Ha! That's really a big thief! Really talented!" someone immediately said, talking about the rice. The words showed praise. But he felt that what he said was improper, and so he added criticism. "Damn it! Shameless! And he's the owner of a printing house?"</p>
<p>"Yes! He's the owner of a printing house!" the policeman, feeling remorseful, immediately corrected himself. He now stood in the middle of the crowd, showing his air of being an expert in catching thieves. "If he specialized in this kind of thing, then people might say, 'Oh! The theft from the rice shop on this street was arranged beforehand with the police!' But he's the owner of a printing house!..."</p>
<p>"Then, then—" a little old woman, lifting her face, displaying a spirit of "dedication to the utmost, until death," asked with great disappointment: "The thief...taken to the station! What about the rice? Where did the rice go! Is it still here... here..." As she spoke, her two damaged eyes looked around, seemingly unable to let go of the crowd-filled doorway. "Alas!" she sighed, "Working hard on the streets all day, without even a measure of rice!"</p>
<p>The heroes of mankind, however, all echoed the policeman's arguments and even praised him:</p>
<p>"That's right! Old fellow! You have talent! If everyone on the same street was stealing from each other, what would become of us! Shanghai is a strange place, a boss stealing rice! Even if the printing business isn't doing well, he can change to another business! -- Hmph!" Then, an invisible bullet was fired from his nose, as if it had hit the thief in the chest, causing him pain.</p>
<p>"But, but—the rice shop owner! Hmm!" the restaurant owner continued to wipe his forehead, saying in a low voice, "The rice shop owner raises rice prices! Hmm! Hmm!..."</p>
<p>"Where? Where? They should lower grain prices even more!" Following this, a voice sounded in the restaurant owner's ear. The owner turned to look: it was a worker from the Rencheng Coal Shop, his black face and hands making him look like a black ghost. "—I, I, was still farming in the countryside last year!"</p>
<p>"Damn it!" But the owner was still thinking about his own affairs. "Even your family's firewood! Hmph!" He glanced at him with his eyes, and then looked at the hero of heroes, the police officer: the police officer was still enthusiastically carrying out his explanation. He wanted to see expressions of praise on every astonished face.</p>
<p>The young women seemed to have put down a load, looking at each other, winking, and pursing their lips, silently exchanging their meanings, as if all felt some joy, but also some sense of lack. They had no time to see the thief's face. They finally asked each other, "What kind of person is he? Thick eyebrows and big eyes? —But he must have a sturdy arm!" An arm, that is what they worshiped, a brave man. A man who could carry eleven bags of rice, flying over walls and roofs—such a man would be so lovely! They turned their heads again, looking into the doorway. They seemed to be jealous of the gourd-faced man standing in front of the bed.</p>
<p>"Go! Go!" The policeman still raised his hand for maintaining order. "What is there to see? The thief has been caught! The stolen goods have been recovered! What is there to see! Go! Go!" And so, an eagle claw-like iron hand flew over the heads of the crowd. The crowd had no intention of leaving: you looked at me, I looked at you, their feet constantly tapping on the same spot.</p>
<p>The eagle claw-like iron hand soared over the head of a thin, yellow-faced young writer. He sighed and said:</p>
<p>"Who exactly is the thief? —Who remembers our land? Who remembers the sweat and blood of the farmers who toil on our land?..."</p>
<p>But in the end, he also stole this subject matter and left.</p>

<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>—One of the Scenes of Weihaiwei—</p>
<p>The sea wind roared all night long, the cold violently agitating on the shore. The dried yellow fish, hung under the eaves and dried since summer, was slapped against the wall by the wind, making continuous *ba-la ba-la* sounds. After the donkey in the eastern neighbor's yard brayed, the snoring old sow also cried out, rubbed her itchy body against the edge of the trough, and then fell back into her sty, sleeping with a *hu-la hu-la* sound.</p>
<p>When the rooster crowed for the first time, the horse in the neighbor's stable whinnied. At this time, Sister-in-law Shuangxi woke up. She gently touched Fuer next to her. He was sleeping soundly and sweetly. She pulled the quilt over her body up a little more and covered the child tightly. Then, she turned over to push Brother Shuangxi.</p>
<p>"Get up, get up, it's early!"</p>
<p>Brother Shuangxi hummed a couple of times, lazily turned over like a child, and fell asleep again with a snore.</p>
<p>She knew that Brother Shuangxi worked hard all day. Sleeping a little longer was not laziness. He needed to release the fatigue in his body, but his life would not allow him to rest. His child and wife needed him to put food on the table. If he didn't go fishing for even a day, life would give him a hard time. So she had to knock on Brother Shuangxi's back a second time. He yawned a few times, got up, rubbed the sleep from his eyes, and busied himself with putting on his clothes. Finally, he reached for his pipe next to the pillow. Sister-in-law Shuangxi grumbled, complaining that he was getting up too late. She nagged at him without cease. He smoked a few bowls of tobacco, looked at the white light showing through the window paper, and got off the kang. After groping around on the east wall of the kitchen, he finally found the fishing net that Sister-in-law Shuangxi had just repaired yesterday.</p>
<p>The sparse stars were still shining in the sky. The alley was dark. Far away, the electric light at the Weixin Road intersection was dim and unclear, as if its color had been drained by the cold wind. He shivered, stepped on the frozen mud road, and hurried away. The firelight in the pipe bowl occasionally flashed a part of his face. It was filthy and greasy, as if he had never washed his face from birth until now. He was covered in fishy stench, and his hands and feet smelled of fish brine.</p>
<p>Walking onto Weixin Road, he left the darkness behind. The coachman sat huddled in the front seat of the carriage, dozing. The horse stood firmly on all four hooves, chewing its "liu zi" with its back to the wind. At the intersection with Zhongshan Road, the traffic police officer was pacing back and forth in the street. Shuangxi's spirits lifted as he walked, as if a cat was grabbing at his ears. He whistled and went straight to the East Wharf. The lead weights on the fishing net *ba-la ba-la* sounds.</p>
<p>The wind and waves constantly crashed in from the sea.</p>
<p>Far away, the British warship was flashing star-like lights. The waves roared, the sound of the fishermen's oars, and the people and lights on the dock were mixed together, creating a loud commotion. Brother Shuangxi became more and more anxious as he walked. He thought:</p>
<p>—Jiang Sheng must be getting angry waiting?</p>
<p>When he walked behind the Donghai Hotel, a sailor came from the south, with a woman. He was used to seeing this. He knew they were British sailors and White Russian dancers. The woman was laughing. The sailor seemed to have lost his footing, staggering towards Brother Shuangxi. A wave of overwhelming alcohol odor entered Brother Shuangxi's nostrils from the sailor.</p>
<p>The sailor suddenly pounced on Brother Shuangxi like a lion, grabbing him and hitting him. At first, Brother Shuangxi didn't dare to resist and kept dodging backwards, but the sailor was acting as if he had met an enemy, hitting him relentlessly. Brother Shuangxi, unable to bear it any longer, pushed the sailor with all his strength. The sailor fell into the small drainage ditch by the side of the road with a *pu-chi* sound. He was shouting wildly. The woman laughed and walked away alone.</p>
<p>The sailor was screaming and shouting, unable to get up. His body was splattered with muddy water. Seeing that things were going badly, Brother Shuangxi ran away. The police whistle sounded sharply behind him. As he ran near the bathhouse, he was caught by the patrolling police chief:</p>
<p>"Why are you running?"</p>
<p>"I…I'm in a hurry to go fishing…"</p>
<p>"Why is there blood on your face? Tell me the truth, what did you do?"</p>
<p>The police came up with the sailor.</p>
<p>"It was him—" pointing at Brother Shuangxi—"he robbed this foreigner!"</p>
<p>Brother Shuangxi was surrounded by terror, his whole body shivering, his lips trembling:</p>
<p>"He hit me for no reason, am I not allowed to fight back?"</p>
<p>The police chief slapped Brother Shuangxi hard across the face:</p>
<p>"Hit you? Why would an Englishman hit you!"</p>
<p>"Search him, see what he robbed?"</p>
<p>"First, take him to the station and we'll talk."</p>
<p>The sailor was sent to Weihai Hospital by the police chief in a horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>Brother Shuangxi was tied with ropes and dragged to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>The storm raged more furiously. The snow on Liugong Island reflected the frozen clouds in the sky, white and vast. Far in the east, a ball of red light appeared on the horizon. The sun was about to rise. The great British warship stood tall on the sea, spewing thick smoke. The pier was filled with fishmongers, watching the returning fishing boats from afar. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e225">Abyssinia's Last Resistance <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Under the oppression of power, Abyssinia used flesh and blood to resist Italy's guns and bullets, fighting bitterly for seven months. Although the Abyssinian army has suffered repeated heavy blows, the Abyssinian people have not succumbed. Diplomatically, Abyssinia, in the League of Nations, firmly rejected the harsh conditions proposed by Italy and demanded that all sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League Covenant be fully implemented. Militarily, the Abyssinian army is preparing for a final resistance. The other day, crowds gathered at the racecourse in the Abyssinian capital, quietly listening to the Abyssinian king's edict, ordering men capable of wielding weapons to gather military equipment, bullets, and food, awaiting orders to depart. At that time, five thousand people immediately announced their willingness to fight to the death. Meanwhile, Abyssinian women continue to advise men to resist the Italian army with all their strength. The Abyssinian government has also issued a declaration, encouraging the people, saying that it is better to die as an Abyssinian ghost than to live as an Italian slave. The nation's determination to fight the enemy together is evident.</p>
<p>How Abyssinia's final resistance will turn out in the future cannot be determined now. Judging from the situation of the war, the future is more likely to be ominous than auspicious. However, we believe that if the Abyssinian army wins the battle, its morale will be boosted, and it is not absolutely hopeless to continue the struggle in the future and recover the lost land. Unfortunately, defeat is also glorious. The liberation struggle of oppressed peoples is inherently difficult. How could Abyssinia not understand that its own strength is weak and cannot withstand the blow of Italy's elite weapons? However, in order to fight for the oppressed peoples, they disregard everything and only resist to the death. Abyssinia's action both teaches the aggressor nation a lesson and encourages the oppressed peoples. We believe that in the future, if a group of ambitious people recklessly and blindly invade the weak, they will inevitably encounter strong resistance. Many people have discussed Abyssinia's resistance against the enemy, saying that it is brave, but unfortunately too unrealistic, resulting in today's tragic defeat. We think this is wrong. It must be known that Italy's attempt to annex Abyssinia is very ambitious. If Abyssinia does not dare to resist and submits, it would probably have already become a slave of Italy.</p>
<p>The East African War has reached a critical juncture. Abyssinia's last resistance is not only related to the survival of a country but also sufficient to determine the fate of oppressed peoples around the world.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Escape <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>In winter, the northwest wind blew the bare branches, whistling. No one knows where the stray dogs have fled to. Occasionally, the sound of the night watchman floats from afar, making the countryside night more desolate and terrifying. Villagers are especially calculating. After eating dinner, they blew out the fire and huddled into broken cotton batting. They are reluctant to put more cooking oil in their dishes, and how attentive they are to the oil in their oil lamps!</p>
<p>The sky had no stars and no moon. The entire countryside lay quietly in the embrace of darkness, like a wounded jackal. However, Ah Gou in Donggou was suffering from a serious illness. His mother and daughter were waiting by his bedside. The oil lamp on the wall was still flickering with a ray of pale green light. The patient opened his mouth wide, his eyes rolled back, slightly yawning, looking like he was asleep or like he was dead. The mother and daughter's eyes were swollen and red like walnuts. They were worried about Ah Gou's illness and even more afraid of the tragedy that would come tomorrow morning. They hugged each other tightly, but the dilapidated house was attacked by arrow-like cold winds from all sides. They looked at Ah Gou's pale face and then paid attention to each other, as if exchanging the pain in their hearts.</p>
<p>The sound of the clapper floated from afar again. It was three o'clock in the morning. Dawn was just around the corner. The daughter finally snuggled against her mother's cold cheek, and said slowly, "Mom, let's listen to Dad and escape before dawn."</p>
<p>The mother instinctively hugged her daughter tighter. Tears flowed from everyone's eyes, dripping from the corners of their eyes along their cheeks, indistinguishable from which person they belonged. She breathed a sigh of relief from the depths of her heart, "But, Yuexiang, how can Dad escape when he is ill?"</p>
<p>She was immediately afraid of waking up Ah Gou on the bed, so she moved from one end of the bed to the other, but Ah Gou was still sleeping like he was dead. She wiped her tears with the corner of her clothes and continued:</p>
<p>"There really aren't any good people in this world! That little devil, Afu, used to receive so many benefits from your dad, but now he has stumbled into a good fortune and become a rent collector. His eyes are growing out of his forehead and he won't sell anyone any favors…" She sobbed and couldn't continue. Afu's dog face seemed to be standing in front of her:</p>
<p>"Hmph! If you don't pay your rent, what am I, Afu, supposed to eat! To put it bluntly, Yuexiang is so old, it would be a disgrace to you to become a concubine for Master Hu! I will pick her up tomorrow by small sedan. Old man, you better think about it clearly!"</p>
<p>He pushed Ah Gou, and swaying, left. Ah Gou had been sick for more than two months. When Afu came to the door today, he barely straightened his back from the bed and said many good words, but he was already out of breath. Without warning, Afu pushed him in the chest, and he rolled down from the edge of the bed, speechless for a long time. There was only a trace of breath rising and falling in his chest.</p>
<p>The mother and daughter scrambled, heated a towel, and used the folk method of pricking the soles of his feet. When Ah Gou woke up, he mustered all his strength to slap his old wife, shouting, "You heartless pig and dog!" But he immediately understood that the pig and dog had already run back to the city to fawn over Master Hu. He watched his wife stroking her slapped cheek, and he said apologetically:</p>
<p>"I said long ago that guarding these few acres of land will eventually lead to starvation! You listen to me and escape! I am not…useful…anymore!"</p>
<p>The mother and daughter lay on the edge of the bed, crying. Ah Gou gnashed his teeth in hatred.</p>
<p>Now the firelight on the wall was even smaller and flickering, about to go out. The mother could only shed tears and sigh. She couldn't abandon her sick husband and escape, and she didn't want to give her own flesh and blood to those dog things.</p>
<p>Ah Gou suddenly woke up, and he still shouted loudly, "Escape! What's the point of guarding me!" He tried hard to struggle up from the bed, but his hands went limp, and he fell from the corner of the bed like a piece of luggage, his mouth stained with a stream of red blood—he was dead.</p>
<p>The wife threw herself on the corpse, crying and shouting…</p>
<p>The daughter suddenly shouted as if waking up from a dream, "Mom, escape!" Like her father's voice, it was powerful, "What's the point of guarding me!"</p>
<p>"But what about your dad?" The mother wanted to pick up Ah Gou's corpse.</p>
<p>"The living can't wait for the dead!" She was frantically packing things, not knowing where the strength came from, and pulled her mother away.</p>
<p>The sky was slowly brightening, and raindrops were floating in the air. They stepped on the muddy road and left the village, but the distance was a fog…</p>
<h3 id="e227">Too Bright <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Yangzhi</p>
<p>People's eyes value seeing light, and seeing great light. (Because those who can see light have happiness.)</p>
<p>But a person with an eye disease not only cannot see light, but his eyes are often blurry. Has his happiness not been plundered?</p>
<p>So if there is a disease in the eyes, it should be treated properly. In the past, many people with eye diseases suffered without good medicine. Since the launch of the Bright Bright Eye Drops of the Wuzhou Pharmacy, it is like giving birth to a savior for those with eye diseases, because it can relieve pain and itching, reduce inflammation and remove redness, contract and sterilize, and specializes in treating various eye diseases. Its effectiveness surpasses all similar products.</p>
<p>Bright Bright Eye Drops can restore light to dark eyes!</p>
<p>Bright Bright Eye Drops can make diseased eyes shine brightly!</p>
<h3 id="e228">The Pain of Spring <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Jigong</p>
<p>Springtime is bright and sunny, with peach blossoms and green willows. People should feel happy. But some people also feel pain!</p>
<p>What kind of people feel pain in the spring? Listen to me:</p>
<p>It turns out that people who have suffered from venereal diseases, although seemingly cured, still have residual toxins in their blood. Every spring, the illness relapses. Although injection therapy is prevalent in modern times, it can only kill bacteria. It still requires internal medicine to clear the residual toxins in the blood. Without doing so, it is difficult to completely cure!</p>
<p>I now want to commend "Hai Bo Medicine" because it can cleanse the blood and detoxify, and it is a special internal medicine for treating syphilis. It can cure all stages of syphilis and skin diseases caused by unclean blood. Taking it in advance before the onset can achieve twice the result with half the effort, eliminating hidden dangers in the invisible, and making those who feel such pain in spring feel happy. (Note: Hai Bo Medicine is distributed by Wuzhou Pharmacy.)</p>

<p>— Shu Mang</p>
<p>Thus, his youthful dreams ended; he became indifferent to the many windy and rainy days of unhappiness that followed. He diligently worked "like a beast" for the Third Master for twelve years, earning a bit of meager land, burying his dead parents and wife, and then lived on like a fool. However, he had hope: he hoped that one day good fortune would fall upon him, and then everything would go smoothly, "with land, money, and good days..."</p>
<p>In famine years, the young men all went to work in distant cities, but the young "Fifth Uncle" (at that time, people only called him "A-Wu") still hid in the countryside and complained about his fate, selling his only two-plus acres of land. Afterwards, he continued to do the "fine work" he was content with.</p>
<p>Thus, year after year passed, and the young men from the distant cities returned. Several years of labor and earnings brought considerable wealth, so they bought land, bought houses, and built their lives in stability; they went to see "Brother A-Wu" of the same generation, who was already the gray-haired Fifth Uncle. He was still cultivating laboriously, envying others' "fate," hoping that one day good fortune would fall upon him...</p>
<p>Just like that, lightly, wastefully, and unconsciously, Fifth Uncle's life passed tragically: now, at dusk or dawn, in moments of loneliness, he realized that good fortune might never come; he waited a lifetime, hoped a lifetime, but the result was a "failure."</p>
<p>Fifth Uncle thought of the grave, thought of death—he dared not think anymore.</p>
<p>He admitted that he was a failure in life.</p>
<h3 id="e230">On the Boat <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>The river water gurgled, and the lights on both banks gradually faded and went out with the disappearance of dusk. A dim red river lantern hung by the bridgehead, gently swayed by the wind, its red flame flickering like a ghost fire. The entire wilderness was still, and the thick black night air spread like a mist, drifting along the river's body into the vast fields. Under the clear blue sky, it was a charming quiet night.</p>
<p>To the left of the bridge arch, a yellow punt lay askew. A wide gangplank was set up from the bow of the boat to the shore. A man slowly walked out of the village, swaying his body. He crossed a stretch of sinking sand. As he stepped onto the gangplank, a woman crawled out of the mat shed in the stern. She held a small Mobil lamp in her hand. She stood up, and the light flickered twice in the river wind. The man also bumped into her. The woman hunched down again and crawled back into the shed, saying:</p>
<p>"You're back so late, look how drunk you are."</p>
<p>The man didn't speak. He stuffed an empty grain sack under the deck board, and then flipped over and lay down like a lump of mud, drowsily squinting his eyes, nodding his head as if he was about to fall asleep. The woman sat next to him, pushing his flushed, greasy face, and asked:</p>
<p>"How much money did you sell it for, you dead pig? You haven't even mixed in the sand yet. What will you do if you fall asleep?"</p>
<p>He remembered mixing in the sand, and seemed to sober up a lot. The grain store owner's face had always been frightening. He remembered that the last time he sold a bag of wheat, after the grain was all transferred from the boat to the shore, Hongchang Store discovered that eight pecks were missing. Without saying a word, they called two policemen to arrest him and take him to the station. Only after his wife handed over all the money she had saved did they release him, and they didn't even give him a penny for boat fare.</p>
<p>He held up five fingers, telling the woman the amount of money he had sold this bag of sorghum for today. He pulled back his arm, grabbed the tile pot by the quilt, and drank for a while. Then, he suddenly darted to the front cabin, where a fellow was sleeping soundly. He leaned down and punched him hard. The fellow grabbed the quilt and cursed unclearly:</p>
<p>"Damn your sister, you drank enough cat pee, why don't you go find a woman? What are you doing hitting me in the middle of the night?"</p>
<p>"Hey, get up, we haven't mixed in the sand yet! Tomorrow, we'll see the patrolmen come to arrest people, and I'll have them arrest you!"</p>
<p>This fellow, who was half-asleep, sat up, put on his clothes, and rubbed his eyes with his big fist, saying:</p>
<p>"Anyway, we didn't steal, we didn't break the law, damn you. You should be sent to the Public Security Bureau!"</p>
<p>"Are you dividing the money or not? If you don't, all the trouble will be mine..."</p>
<p>The two men cursed each other. One after the other, they walked down the boat along the gangplank. Each of them carried a tin dustpan, shoveled full of sand on the beach, and then climbed back onto the boat, pouring it into the hold filled with sorghum. After each person carried five loads, they returned to the boat, grabbed a small wooden board, jumped into the sorghum hold, and tried their best to spread the sand particles, mixing it with the sorghum so that it was indistinguishable. They thinly scattered the three bags of sorghum that were placed on the hold cover on the surface, and everything was properly cleaned up. The two fellows wiped the sweat from their faces and squatted side by side on the riverbank to wash their faces. The drunken man turned back to the stern and slept with the woman in his arms. The other sat on the bow of the boat, lonely, holding a pipe, the firelight flashing red in the night shadows. He was used to the leisurely sound of the water on this small river, and he was also familiar with this quiet night. Everything was as before. The man who slept with the woman in his arms snored very loudly. He thought that was happy and blissful, especially on this spring evening. Finally, he thought about the bag of sorghum his fellow stole. Tomorrow, they would divide the money. After getting the money, he would run to the town in the evening and find a "half-covered door" to sleep with her for a night, wouldn't that be happy too?...</p>
<p>Looking up at the sky, three stars hung obliquely in the blue sky. He tapped off the ash from his pipe and climbed back into the cabin to lie down.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Village Fair <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>A-Gen and A-Mao were just darting around in the crowd.</p>
<p>The two eleven- or twelve-year-old children were wearing single shirts, and their faces were still flushed. After all, it was the end of March, and children love excitement. Bean-sized beads of sweat were flowing on A-Gen's forehead, and he didn't wipe them with his sleeves. His sleeves were already greasy enough. A-Mao was also wiping, but he was wiping snot, not sweat.</p>
<p>More and more people were gathering on that street. Everyone was looking outside the city. The mothers and daughters were leaning against the windows along the street, some standing at the entrances of the shops. The people in the shops were also craning their necks, not doing business. The sugarcane stalls at the intersection were busy scraping the skin, and there were strings of peeled water chestnuts, tenderly enticing the fairgoers who were thirsty for excitement.</p>
<p>"It's coming, it's coming!"</p>
<p>The crowd stirred, but there was actually nothing there. Everyone was patient. They often grabbed a familiar passerby. "How far is the fair from there?", "It's coming, it's coming" was usually the answer.</p>
<p>A-Gen and A-Mao were small, so they squeezed to a good spot at a corner. But they were short, so they had to look up and stand on tiptoes. Still, they could only see the broad backs of others. They were anxiously darting around, their liver-like red faces covered in snot and sweat.</p>
<p>Many people had already stood on the short railings of the rice shop at the corner, craning their necks. A-Gen climbed up and sat on it, and A-Mao followed A-Gen's example. So, they sat on the short railings and waited very proudly.</p>
<p>"The fair is coming, the fair is coming!" Another uproar.</p>
<p>They waited for almost three li.</p>
<p>"Gong! Gong!" The sound of gongs vibrated down the street from afar.</p>
<p>Slowly, the small flags guiding the way vigorously waved to clear a path. Far away, the top of a large flag appeared, the sound getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>"The fair is really coming now," A-Gen said.</p>
<p>A-Mao's small eyes darted around for a moment, and he nodded, chewing melon seeds and carefully holding onto the crossbar of the short railing. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Song of Böel</p>
<p>Lyrics by Tian Han, composed by Lü Ji</p>
<p>Life is like a turbid river of mud, flowing slowly and steadily towards who knows where. Machines have dried up our muscles and bones, coal smoke has blackened our faces, and liquor has burned our hearts. The resentment that builds up in our hearts after drinking cannot find a place to vent, so we are helpless. Every day we see fathers beating their sons, husbands beating their wives, or else we pick up a prostitute and dance a jig! Or we pick up an accordion and sing a sweet love song:</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Tea Visit"</p>
<p>He was honest and upright throughout his life. He was Fan Zhongyan, a famous minister of the Song Dynasty. He was newly appointed as the prefect of Kaifeng. He privately inspected the people. Disguised as a traveler, who could recognize him? He leisurely strolled into a teahouse. Holding fragrant tea, he sipped the clear spring water. Suddenly, he saw a master and servant walking in. Inside, the teahouse owner greeted them obsequiously, repeatedly calling him "Master." After a few words, they disagreed and acted rudely. Before leaving, they uttered vicious words. He inquired and learned that Zhang Min was evil, acting lawlessly and relying on his wealth and power. His family slave helped him do evil, calling Zhang Qian. He tried to talk about Zhou Yu's affair in the past, who used his desire for beauty to take a life. He filled two ingots of silver with twenty ingots, poisoning the scholar and exiling him. They parted ways at the government office, with tears streaming down their faces. His wife and children were scattered for more than ten years. After investigating the evil deeds, he returned to the yamen. He immediately issued a judgment on the spot. Zhang Min's crimes were unforgivable. The high-hanging mirror shone impartially. Ten thousand people admired and praised the pure sky.</p>

Fearing the ridicule of passersby, they had to bid farewell and walk away.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Transportation has specially invited the Honolulu Orchestra to play the latest European and American songs every Friday from 7:20 PM to 7:50 PM. Recently, many comrades in the business community have organized an amateur group at No. 221 Nanjing Road; with the pure purpose of studying music. It is named the Vocal Music Association. And Mr. Pu Canzhan, Mr. Mingyuan, and Mr. Tingrui are hired as instructors. They are now preparing to expand the association and solicit members. The charter will be sent by mail. (Yan)</p>
<p>The Children's Broadcasting Troupe has created a broadcasting championship competition to encourage children's interest in sound outside of class. The first place winner will be awarded a valuable award flag made by the director of the troupe. The second and third place winners will receive silver shields and silver cups. The rest will be awarded books or souvenirs. The ranking is based on the number of favorable letters from listeners received by the children who broadcast on the Sino-Western Radio Station every Sunday for ten periods. The troupe now welcomes children from outside to join and compete for the championship, and hopes that listeners will send letters to judge. The address of the troupe: No. 77 Fuyou Road, Nanshi Ming Primary School. (Liu Hen)</p>

<p>Wang Xianzai</p>
<p>Wang Xianzai, in our impressions, he is indeed a bad guy, of course, because the roles he plays mostly belong to the "anti" "faction". The terrible image of Wang Xianzai that exists on our minds is actually clear evidence of his successful acting skills, but in "New and Old Shanghai" he is not as cunning and terrifying as before. He has become an interesting typical Shanghainese who "has to save face," and brings you infinite laughter.</p>
<p>Shu Xiuwen</p>
<p>On the stage of drama, Shu Xiuwen has received extremely long and extremely rich training and experience. The extremely high honor she has achieved in acting in movies can be attributed to her past efforts in honing herself. "Shu Xiuwen is a female star who knows how to act the most!" someone is shouting like this, which is not an exaggeration. In "New and Old Shanghai", Shu Xiuwen's extraordinary performance will make you not recognize that sentence, we introduce it so boldly.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Shanghai Theater Alumni Association Public Performance <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Starting May 2nd at Lake Society on Guizhou Road</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Shanghai Theater, most of the old figures have left the theater. Recently, they decided to perform in a decision in the name of the "Alumni Association". It is heard that the stage has been decided at Lake Society, and the date is from May 2nd. The script is a three-act play "Mother Would Rather Die", now changed to "Love, Desire and Morality". The scenery and props are being rushed to be made.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Ruth has returned to China from Japan (staying for a while and reportedly going to Japan again). Yesterday, when "Human Hell" was being tested at the Shanghai Grand Theater, she appeared. Acquaintances were surprised to ask, "When did you come back?" She said lightly, "More than a month ago, I've been in the countryside. I haven't been in Shanghai for a few days."</p>
<p>"Human Hell" exposed some of the dark conditions of prisons, which made people quite moved, but there were places similar to "The Fugitive" and "Raging Tide", but it was not as calm and powerful as "The Fugitive" and "Raging Tide". The play itself cannot be considered wrong, and several comparisons are very powerful. There are sudden places throughout the film, I don't know if it was cut or was originally like this?</p>
<p>There is such a saying: The "Resurrection" of the Nanjing China Stage Association originally wanted to invite a female musician who had studied in France to star, but because she was not a "star" and was afraid that there would not be much appeal when it was released, it was decided to call Hu Ping to star.</p>
<p>A friend said with great emotion after hearing this news: "The star system has its reasons for existence after all."</p>
<p>The China Traveling Troupe has been rehearsing plays at Tianyi Company these days, and they seem very excited.</p>
