<p>— 賓</p>
<p>巴力斯坦的回猶民族糾紛自前月十九日爆發後情勢日趨嚴重最近且已擴爲反英運動了耶路撒冷全城於十五日起開始舉行公民不合作運動拒付一切捐稅以爲罷工罷市的聲援據路透二十三日電巴力斯坦的各村鎭現在已有大批英軍開到無數的轟炸機終日在空中翱翔形勢緊張宛如入了戰時狀態</p>
<p>巴力斯坦是地中海東岸的一個國家本是處於土耳其帝國的統治之下自第一次世界大戰後卽爲英國所佔領一九二〇年恊約國對士的塞佛爾條約（Sevres）規定巴力斯坦爲英國的代管地從此後英國就在那裏設立高級委員會兼理行政和立法可是佔巴力斯坦人口總數百分之八十的阿刺伯人對於英國的統治一向不滿常常發生反英運動英國爲要鞏固它在這裏的統治就採取了一種離間民族的分化政策竭力的贊助猶太復國運動把猶太人盡量移殖到巴力斯坦去原來巴力斯坦本是猶太人的故鄕不過因他們一向散處各地所以住居那裏的還是阿刺伯人多近年來散處各地的猶太人因受許多國家政府的虐待東西流亡深感痛苦頗想重建祖國於是有所謂「猶太復國運動」的產生猶太人的不斷移殖巴力斯坦對於阿刺伯人當然不利因此民族糾紛時常發生英國得以坐收漁利藉此鞏固它在那裏的統治</p>
<p>這樣「猶太復國運動」就成了英國統治巴力斯坦的主要支柱這自然更不能爲阿刺伯民族主義者所接受所以回猶的民族衝突也可以說是阿刺伯反英運動的一環在過去巴力斯坦阿刺伯人的民族解放運動都是以反對英國和猶太殖民者爲主要目標一九二九年的「泣牆」事件一九三二年的大罷工一九三三年的武裝事變都表現了這種運動的高潮只不過因領導者缺乏力量終至都歸失敗</p>

<p>— 主慶增主編</p>
<p>非常時期之財政問題（下）　馬寅初</p>
<p>中國財政之出路</p>
<p>故以現在中國之財政情形論，主動的對外作戰絕不可能，然被動的襲擊繼續不斷時，我國不能始終隱忍退讓，所謂和平未到絕望時期，决不放棄和平，犧牲非至緊要關頭，亦不輕言犧牲，自其有限度，苟至和平不得不放棄，犧牲不得不壯烈時，固亦非赤手空拳之犧牲，必須於無法中選擇比較合理之財政政策方可，吾意於緊急環境之下，又可分最急與决急二法，最急時，稅制旣不乃改良，惟有征發民財，雖不必强使人人毀家紓難，必令其量力捐輸，亦墊所不得已也，决急之法，應仿照英國辦法，施行所得稅爲稅制中心，旣無毀傷資本之弊，而有隨時抬高稅率，增加收入之利，甚盼政府能立即施行，以便人民對繳納所得稅，養成一種善良習慣，使戰事不至即時爆發，則所得稅習慣已養成，足可應付矣，即使尚未發成，則征發制度猶可採肘，雖非理想辦法，較之濫發紙幣終勝一籌矣，且將來之執戈抗敵者必多屬貧民，彼輩不惜以生命爲孤注，犧牲不可謂不重，富人平日旣得政府之保護，養尊處優，則戰時犧牲其財產，亦義不容辭，故當此國難嚴重關頭，興亡所繫，人人有資，無論爲貧爲當，均須犧牲，貧民出力，富人出錢，衡以平等之義，亦不相違，所不同者，貧民以生命爲犧牲，其犧牲本必眞實，蓋有死有不死者，然當其效命疆塲之日，固不能先知誰生誰死，各有爲國捐軀之精神則同，故可稱犧牲之機會均等，犧牲則不相等，若所得稅依負担能力之大小累進征收，犧牲之平等，早爲財政學者所公認，無待言矣，即量力輸財，其犧牲亦未嘗不平等也，苟吾人能在此兩大原則下，大可與敵人一戰，只待其决心之如何耳。</p>
<p>以中日整個經濟組織比較，日本物力雖較中國爲强，然日本爲新興之工業國，財產集中於大椅濱東京等大都市，實不能勝任長期之戰鬥，中國以農業經濟爲主，財富比較分散，有久戰之能力，故吾意國人如有决心作畏期抵抗，前途頗可樂觀也。</p>
<p>釋疑</p>
<p>日前曾由新聞記者叩詢關於我國非常時期之財政政策，鄙人根據上述意見之結果，總括爲三點相告，</p>
<p>從速開辦所得稅，爲戰時稅收之中心，　有限制的膨脹通貨，旣可補助財政，亦有利於國外貿易，　發行少數公債，</p>
<p>自此論出後，不乏表示懷疑者，以所得稅我國尚未舉辦，即使政府立時開征，稅收能吾如我人所期望，大成問題，故有主張應以整理財政，以充實非常時期之財政收入者，更有主張以開辦土地增値稅，加征娛樂稅奢侈稅印花稅郵資及勸某捐以裕國庫者，對於以上各種增加非常時期國庫收入乏辦法，余均可贊成，惟土地增値稅收入有限，德國初辦時即如此，且屬於地方收入，英國之土地增値稅與印花稅收入在戰事期內反比戰則减少，其他如娛樂捐奢侈稅郵資加價以及戰爭嬴利稅等等雖爲數有限，然集腋成裘，亦不無小補，至於消極方面之　理財政，（如消除浪費，削减駢枝機關，剔除中飽等等），則在平時早應爲之，並非非常時期之緊急辦法，此外如再有有利於國家之合理合法收人，亦無不歡迎各方發抒偉見，以收集思廣益，衆志成城之效，至所得稅在舉辦之初，稅收固無把握，如政府能立即開辦，使人民養成一種繳納所得稅之善良習慣，未始非他日增加所得稅收之補助，英國在歐戰時能恃所得稅爲主要收入，亦由於人民對所得稅已有警良習慣所致，並非一蹴而就，鄙意非常時期國庫中關鹽統稅各主要稅收固將短少，但不致根本停頓，其他收入亦不致分文無着，萬一有限制之通貨膨脹與發少數公債尚不足彌補非常時期財政緊急需要，最好能在不損我主權原則之下，向友邦商借外債，以資供應，想友邦基於平素與我國邦交之敦睦，或不致拒絕，惟各友邦基於貸欵國對借欵國復興期投資之重大損失，及其本國之經濟恐慌，此舉未必有望，更不獲已，能與債權國家商洽，將舊有外債延期還本，亦爲非常時期財政政策之另一出路，因此舉如能實現，一年最少可减少支出一萬萬元左右也。（完）</p>

<p>— 北平特信</p>
<p>局勢緊張了</p>
<p>日方在河北增兵聲浪，唱之已久，本月中旬，經卽實現，十六日午十二時，第五師團之旅團長河邊正三，亦已到平，旅團司令部，當天就在東交民巷之奧國使館舊址成立，軍隊亦卽陸續前來，聞到六月底，始可吿一段落，今後堂堂的故都，恐實際上要成爲日本軍事根據地了，增兵的數目，日方不允發表，只謂外傳三師團·五師團·之說，全係謠言，但據各方面可靠消息，大槪北平要增至一千人，豐台（平津間之大車站）三百人，天津一萬二千人，通縣一千入</p>
<p>據一般觀察，日方此决增兵，除去對華外交作一種陳兵相向的壓迫形勢外，對於國際，也另有其重大意義的，內蒙方面，近來屢有獨立的謠言，此間日系報紙，又盛傳英俄在本年初，對遠東已成立種種諒解的密的，蘇俄呢，近曾公開宣稱，在軍備競爭方面，對日可佔優勢，而日本素以驍勇善戰著名的第一師團，又開到俄「滿」邊境佈防去了，這種種現象，已經透露出暴風雨前夜的可怕景象，引起國際間無限關心了，十七日，駐津之各國領事，曾一度秘密舉行聯席會議，拍電各本國政府，報吿情形，但十五日，日本陸軍省，亦曾發表此决增兵華北，係防禦標榜抗日之共產軍，而不妨害列國之旣得利益，實則此中意義，不難一望而知，但我們身在北平的人，目覩這故都未來命運，實不免時有人爲刀俎我爲魚肉之感，</p>
<p>鎭定的局面</p>
<p>北平未來命運，雖然是在動盪裏，但當局是依然十分的鎭定，所以一切設施，亦是十分積極，僅就這一週而論，交通委員會和法制委員會，已成立辦公了，衛生展覽會，亦已開幕了，官商懇親會，已舉行過，小規模的市民公園，亦吿落成，車夫福利會，現正在進行中，這些，在表面上，到底給居民們一種常態的現象，日關於擾亂地方秩序的賭窟，和白麵房子，公安局方面，除去在重大的妨碍外，均加以制止，所以市面上，尚幸十分安定，</p>
<p>閒散的市民</p>
<p>現在情勢，和二十二年春天比起來，當然嚴重得多，可是在目前不獨沒有像那年人山人海地擠在車站上，候車逃走，反而一些外埠的遊客，却蜂湧而至，比如上海友聲旅行團，和中國籍的美國好萊塢明星黃柳霜女士，先後來平，足見一斑，並且北寗路局爲旅客便利的綠故，還特爲由天津到北平間，開了看牡丹的專車，</p>
<p>這時，正是北平最好的時候，氣候常在七十度左右，單衣夾衣均可，試登景山或北海之白塔旁一望，則瀰望者，莫不是葱翠之綠色，整個北平，全包藏在樹葉的海裏，或在翠綠叢中，有黃瓦紅牆，露在明亮的日光下，所以前年法國小說家得哥派拉遊平時，曾發表其印象曰，「美麗的北平」。丁香花剛開過去，在枝上留着殘餘的花朶，牡丹花又正盛開，種類繁多，非他處所可及，芍藥花已含苞欲放，嬌艷逼入，宣武門外之崇效寺，及城內之中山公園二處，本年牡丹花，因氣候關係，開得不如往年繁茂，但據其中管理人云，本年遊人之多，較民國五六年之承平時代，允且過之，從上午九時起至下午十時，毫不間斷，但見熙熙攘攘，摩肩擊轂者，均是爲看花而來的，</p>
<p>戲園·公園·電影院·等娛樂塲所，顧客亦似較以前增多，最近如楊小樓郝壽臣在慶樂戲園合演之連環套·及九伐中原·等戲，光陸電影院上映之摩登時代，平安電影院上映之慾熖，莫不塲塲滿座，熱鬧異常，中山公園及北海公園等處，則更是遊人如蟻，最近中山公園，有一天門票竟售到萬張以上，跳舞塲在袁良市長時代，曾大加封閉，僅勝北京飯店一處，最近在公安街，又新開一金扇舞踏塲，每值華燈初上，絃歌不輟，生意異常興隆，據說，老板是日本人，前門外八大胡同一帶的娼寮，營業雖未見起色，但買笑者仍絡繹於途，依然具昇平之象，誰知身居的是嚴重緊張之地帶呢，</p>
<p>十五那天，第十三期黃災獎券，在中山公園之社稷壇前開獎，聚而觀者，在萬人以上，一時空氣甚爲緊張，據說，這决券在北平售出者，佔全數十之匕八，大槪入們越到窮困時，投機心會越盛的，十六日，國際狗展，在法國兵營大操塲舉行時，到塲參加之中外士媛，亦達數百，允其在十七日下午，在華北大學裏，有所謂尊經社的李柳溪等人，舉行第二次的講經會，看起來，大家彷彿很悠閒似的，這種現象到底是大家醉生夢死呢，還是縱情享樂呢，不勝感漑系之，（五月十九日）</p>

<p>本月二十號上午一時餘，梅白格路三九三號謙益祥酒店，正在打烊時，突有盜匪兩名闖入，甲盜袖出手槍，恐嚇聲張，乙即迫令店夥葉烯泉交出錀匙，遂開啓錢筒，將大小國幣八元刧取，正擬圖逃時，不料該酒店股東樊天福（年六十歲鎮江人）上前，將甲盜執槍之手揑住，而另一店夥劉治甫（湖南人，年二十歲），則執凳子一只，向前抵抗，並大聲呼喊，致觸甲盜之怒，向之開放。</p>
<p>手槍五響</p>
<p>偕乙盜飛奔逃逸，樊天福、與劉治甫、則同時受傷倒地，嗣經該管新閘捕房聞警，立飭中西探馳往調查一過，當將兩傷者車送醫院，經醫生騐得樊天福頸項左臂均受彈傷，流血頗多，創勢沉重，留院醫治，劉治甫因傷在肺部，故醫治無效，旋即身死，屍送騐屍所，報經特一院檢察處騐屍，一面將在死者身上檢出之槍彈送交工部局騐械處查騐，茲經</p>
<p>騐槍專家</p>
<p>查得此項子彈，係有寗牌三十二口徑孚槍所放，遂根據此項綫索，因而於前日破獲此案嫌疑犯前保衛團排長江北人花金森（三十九歲）、夏金良（四十四歲）、徐仁和（即徐愛川三十五歲）、三名，緣有張佐先者，向在曹家渡六區公安局充任一百八十二號義務偵緝員，本年正月間，張佐先身帶該有寗牌手槍一支，在狄思成路捕房轄境內與華捕發生衝突，因此張被帶入捕房，但其所帶之手槍，則經工部局手槍間試放，將</p>
<p>彈殼存查</p>
<p>嗣張亦即釋放，現工部局手槍間以騐得劉治甫身上所取出之子彈與張前所帶之手槍子彈，完全相同，且係一槍所出，遂由新閘捕房藥探目丁華國、馬忠榮、楊斐章、張崑峯、西探惠爾考司，於前日往六區公安局，道明前情，張佐先遂被局長扣押，據張稱，此項手槍，係於去年九月間，出欵四十元向某</p>
<p>外國水兵</p>
<p>購得，但於本年四月二十六號，亦以四十元之代價，轉賣與閘北長安路瀛麗人力車公司，內之花金森等詞，中西探遂復往閘北恒豐路恒福裏二十五號，拘捕花金森，詎其時花正在書寫張佐先出賣手槍之筆據，但其據上之日期，則倒填寫爲四月二十六號，其旁尚有公安局偵緝員鄭步才、王毓才、二人（係賣槍之介紹人），乃一併逮捕，在花身畔抄出領有執照之手槍一支，子彈二十六粒，並往大洋橋二十八號、二十一㐚，兩草棚內，續獲同黨夏金良、徐仁和、兩犯，帶入公安局，除將張佐先、鄭步和、王毓才三偵緝員</p>
<p>暫行扣押</p>
<p>外，其餘，花、夏、徐、三犯，併予提回捕房收押，昨晨，解送特一院刑八庭，據捕房律師張天蔭祥述以上情形，謂本案雖在花金森身畔抄出手槍一到，但查係小馬牌與當時之手槍不同，故請求准將獲案三人，准予覉押，以便</p>
<p>繼續偵查</p>
<p>兇器云云，詰之花金森供，向張佐先購得之手槍，彼已由徐仁和爲介紹人出售與黃四黃鐵二人，對於盜刦殺人案供詞支吾，並延范剛律師代辯，譚辛震推事核供，諭花、夏、徐、三人准予覉押七天再訊，並著捕房將獲犯琿往醫院，以便由傷者樊天福指認。</p>

<p>上海生活過了十幾年，重大的毛病，還沒有害過一决。這幾天，忽然害了一决病；體溫高過四十度，時間足有一星期。的確，這在素常以體健自豪的我，算是難得碰頭的一次病，是值紀念的一次病了。</p>
<p>是的，難得碰頭的毛病，是應得留點兒文字來紀念紀念。這一篇「兩隻紅桃」的短短雜文寫成了，便算是我這决病後的一個紀念品吧。</p>
<p>題目是「兩隻紅桃」，可是，各位看官別要誤會了，把牠當成兩隻香甜可口色味俱佳的桃子哩。這旣不是山東肥城桃，也不是奉化水蜜桃，更不是上海龍華的蟠桃。這兒兩隻紅桃的桃字，是指着人體上的一個腺體而言。他的名頭呢，說出來，大家都怪耳熟的，呌做「扁桃腺」。——扁桃腺，這不是蠻蠻耳熟的一個名詞嗎？這個扁桃腺體，位在我們口腔中喉頭的兩側，左右各一的生着，所以是成對兒的二隻，頗不寂寞。那末，爲什麼在這扁桃腺的桃字頭上，頂上一個紅字呢？這很容易明白的：因爲這一對桃有了病了，就紅啦，腫啦，……來了病的變化。在眞的水蜜桃肥城桃色紅起來，是表示牠的成熟可口的程度；這扁桃腺的桃紅起來，却表示牠是中了毒，遇了難，得了病時的病態病象。醫學上稱這病變紅腫時的扁桃腺呌「扁桃腺炎」。炎字在病理學上說，本來就是看看亦紅亦腫，摸摸旣痛且熱的意思。所以　裹把扁桃腺炎寫成「紅桃」，當然除了紅字之外，還包含着腫痛熱三者無疑。此外，在人體上，除扁桃腺炎而外，其他一切的器官組織，凡是應用着這一個炎字的，都包含着同樣的意思：知道這一個器官這一個組織，是有着紅腫痛熱這四個現象。</p>
<p>那末，這對扁桃腺體在喉頭中，平常日子，有點什麼用處？</p>
<p>我說：這喉頭上的二隻桃子，是人體中的一對看門巡捕。口腔中的喉頭好比人身的大門戶，分站在這大門戶左右的扁桃腺體，不是絕像一對看門巡捕是什麼？論牠的功用呢，也就完全是看門巡捕的工作：凡一切飲食物品經過此處，必先經牠的審察查問的。譬如一旦遇到有害人體的細菌之類的毒物，牠便先要起而示威，與之抗拒鬥爭，阻其闖入體內。凡看見牠發起炎來，「赤化」腫大之時，這便是牠正在抵禦外敵，殺菌拒毒的證明咧。論牠的形態呢，牠在平時，並小是圓圓的突出於外，如桃子的那麼形狀，却是平平服服的，並無如桃子之形突出可見。大半的人們都如此。不過，在兒童時節，扁桃腺體是顯然的較成人爲大：成人以後，漸漸平服下去，形消跡退了。然就中也有一部，成人了仍然不隱不消，和兒童時代一般無二，高高突出如二隻小半個的桃子。這種人的扁桃腺體，據說：此較常人容易出毛病，易爲外界的細菌毒物所感染。這種人，口腔中的二位看門巡捕想是因爲火氣過大，生性好鬥，所以動不動就要和敵人格殺爭鬥哩！因此有人主張應將這種過大的扁桃腺體割去，才可减少各種意外的疾病感染。可是學說如此，事實如何，又難定斷哩：美國醫學界以前亦曾做過這樣的一個試騐，結果却並未得到如何的美滿。他們將一大羣數目的兒童，平分爲甲乙兩隊，將甲隊兒童的扁桃腺全部割去，乙隊留之，到後來，兩隊兒童的得病機會，並無若何差別；卽全部被割了扁桃腺體的甲隊兒童，其得病的情形稈度，並不比乙隊减少多少。這足見得病機會多少與這喉頭上一對小小扁桃腺體之存廢並無若何關係似的。所以我想：得病的機會多少，主要的還在乎各人的體質的或强或弱吧！與這喉頭上的一對扁桃腺體的關係還淺哩。</p>
<p>釋題已過，現在轉入正文，來說我這一决的病吧。</p>
<p>我這决害了六七天的毛病，不是什麼大不了的病，就是我這裏標題上所言的「兩隻紅桃」，也就是醫學術語所謂「扁桃腺炎」。</p>
<p>我喉頭上這對桃如何紅起來？我的扁桃腺體如何的發起炎來呢？現在來說牠一個簡略的經過。</p>
<p>本月八日——星期五的晚上，應了朋友的的，赴卡爾登戲院看話劇雷雨。戲畢回院，正好是午前一點鐘，此時身體已感相當的疲倦。旋因明晨護士學校的功課，當着靜寂的深夜，編寫了一點决日應用的講義。事畢就睡，已是二點多了。决日起身，不但疲乏依然，並覺頭昏腦痛，四肢乏力，骨節微徵痠痛等之症象；但飲食照常，「寒熱」亦無，當時我想：大概昨晚遲了，受了點凉，休息休息就好的。故早上的一點功課，仍免强的上了的。休息了一天一夜，到了决日，我滿望他總可以好去或好些了；但，事實竟相反：到决日星期日，頭腦昏痛，四肢疲倦，全身疲乏，精神不快等等全身徵象，反更加的加重增進。此時才想：一定有了點什麼戚染性的東西在體內了。這一天的體溫，由三十七度二，進至三十七度五。喉頭上的症侯，亦於此時發現了：左右兩顆扁桃腺髖已感到紅腫，灼熟，疼痛等等現象；「紅桃」的形熊，已顯然地畢露着了。飲食雖然照常，但以胃口减退，食量自然减少了。於是我也就從這一天起，臥床靜待，以觀其變了。</p>
<p>但是，這還是將近爆發，而尚未到爆發時機的醞釀時期呢。</p>
<p>次日，爆發的時期到了。第一個價號，給你看的，便是體溫極力的往上昇高：由二十八度半，昇至二十九度半；及到晚間，竟到四十度。如是者，的送八小時之久，延至决晨，始行下降一度半左右，但未全退，及至午後，又復外高，且上昇的程度，較第一天有過之無不及：最高時期，竟打破四十度的關！至决晨，仍然下降，而未全降。如是體溫往復昇降，卽每日昇高時，直達四十度，甚或超過四十度；下降時，則在三十八度左右：一連共有三天。</p>
<p>到第四天，昨晚的高溫，始一瀉千里，往下降退，遠於常溫，而不復見其再昇了。這就是到了疾病向愈結束的時期，也就是這「兩雙紅桃一行將仙隱歸夭的時期了。</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>在最近各種之經騐及觀察而論，則結核伉儷間之接觸傳染，不甚廣布，並不如理想中之可爲恐懼焉。此種原因，以Rowand氏之意見，凡結婚者，其年齡大多巳過最危險之時間與劇甚之感受性，故結核伉儷間並不有十分危險之傳染性。此外則體力與抵抗力亦有相當之關係。</p>
<p>在結核伉儷之問，其家庭中人，對於結核傳染及死亡例，自較健康之伉儷家庭爲高。此種原因，當然由於接觸的傳染Barckat氏證明結核性之家庭，較之普通家庭，的高出七倍之傳染例，而小孩之土白克林反應，亦早期變成陽性，的爲八四%，而其中又有八八，四%之小孩，有愛克司光圖上之變化，此種反應，在結核家庭間十齡以上之兒童，則達到百分之百分，以德國之統計而論，此種傳染危險之增加例，並不每個家庭爲相同者，大的僅有三分之一之家庭而口」。</p>
<p>以英國之文獻而觀，對於牛類之結核傳染，採錄甚詳。Griffith氏在皇家會議，對於牛類結核菌與人體結核之關係，發表結果如下。在一百二十八例之腺結核，有四七，五%係牛類菌，在五百四十一例之骨節及關節結核爲八，七%，在一百例之腦膜炎爲十九，〇%，在二百七十五例之肺結核患者爲一，一%。同時英國及惠而斯地方之報告，均證明人體上牛類結核之傳染，俱因半乳的關係，凡幼孩之結核，由於牛類傳染者，有百分之五十以上，均因牛乳之傳染，而乳牛之中，亦有百分之四十爲染有結核症者。在格痕珊島，對於結核牛曾有防癆之設施，在一九一〇至一九一九年間爲七，八七%，在一九二四至一九三一年降至〇，三八％，同時發現五歲以下兒童之結核傳染例，自八，五降至七，二%。最近美國與西班牙，對於半類結核之經過，亦有相當之文獻可資參考矣。吾人當注意者，以各專家之意見，凡牛乳之傳染，大多均由於食道之間，此點在預防上極應予以重視也。</p>
<p>老年入結核之經過，其死亡例之高峯如何，至不一例。以Brian氏之萬國統計，結核死亡例的爲九至十％，在德國則較高，的爲二五%，在撒克生地方，則爲六五％。</p>
<p>最後吾人所亟應注意者，爲「失業保險組織」Invalidenver-sicherung　之主法，乃减少結核死亡例之大原因，蓋此種保險組織，實爲防癆之大本營。在一九三一年，由保險組織管理下之療治機關，達五十九所，共治療四萬九千之結核患者，而受保險者，對於結核之傳染，减少至十六%，若以全體之工作而觀，則收效達反二五％以是而觀，防癆成功之途，捨是莫由矣。</p>
<p>結論　以近年來世界乏文獻及統計而觀，若英德各國均已達到結核死亡例之最低峯，减至每一萬人中僅有七至八之死亡例矣。惟如何再能使其下降，則自非一朝一夕之力所可收効。其他各國，若法國瑞士，雖有極佳之防癆設施，但尚有較高之結核死亡例。至於將來之防癆趨勢何如，以現時之歐洲現狀而觀，結核之傳染尚甚劇烈，若無相當之經濟能力，則其防癆之成功，恐亦尚難。至於結核之死亡例，何以在此處甚高，而在他處則降低，此則僅能以公共之衛生關係及文化之情形如何爲答案矣。（完）</p>

<p>— 邵象伊講　李令棟筆記</p>
<p>—在江蘇省會衛生敎育委員會學校衛生講習班演講—</p>
<p>健康敎育的範圍；以實施便利起見，可以分爲民衆健康敎育與學校健康敎育，今天先談學校健康敎育，學校健康敎育，整個的對象，是在小學生身上，但是中學生和大學生，並非沒有談健康敎育的可能，不需要研究健康敎育，實因大中學生均已達至靑春發動期，智識情竇已開，是已知努力於健康問題之注意，然則兒童正爲人生最寶貴的黃金之時代，日常生活之優劣，足能影響整個將來的一生之得失，所以小學健康敎育，實爲吾人樹立健康敎育之基礎。</p>
<p>二十世紀整個是兒童的時代，兒童爲國家基本組織的細胞，未來國家之主人，欲使國家臻於强盛，必使國民體格健康起來，更非先由兒童身上着手不可，使其有健全之身心，養成其良好之衛生習慣，但在中國大多數家庭敎育，尚在欠缺的途徑中，生活還未能正軌合法，健康敎育根本上還未能爲人們所注意，因此健康敎育在今日，已成爲急迫切需之趨勢，今將健康敎育之目的原則方法與內容，分別說在下面。</p>
<p>一　健康教育之目的</p>
<p>一·灌輸衛生的智識　兒童生活上一切的情形，那件事是合乎衛生那件事是不適合衛生的條件，兒童是很難明瞭，所以然我們先要灌輸兒童衛生智識，一而再，再而三，使其印象日深，則不適合衛生的動作，自然會漸漸矯正，兒童一生都能享受健康幸福。</p>
<p>二·成衛生的習慣　兒童有了衛生智識以後，仍須根據知識上的方法和條例，如飲食，起居，睡眠，大便，運動，刷齒，姿勢，作息，用具，以及身體器官保護，公共衛生的實行等。漸漸訓練其養成良好之習慣，養成衛牛習慣，不是一件普通容易的事，有許多充足衛牛智識的人，他們的動作，往往有時不合乎衛生，由於平時忽略之故，所以不易養成習慣。我們訓練兒童養成衛生習慣，首先將其衛牛智識基礎建築牢固，而後指導兒童知了卽行，隨時隨地矯正其不良習慣，使兒童熟記衛生信條，並日逐H依法進行，不得間斷因循，久而久之，兒童衛生習慣自可入於軌途，關於佈置良好的環境和設備，亦爲促進兒童養成衛生習慣之重要的事。</p>
<p>三·引起兒童對於衛生的興趣假如我們用機械式灌注兒童衛生智識，使其養成衛生習慣，結果的收效，必然微乎其渺，所以必定在事前要引起兒童對於衛生有興趣心發生才好，兒童於接衛生能發生興趣話，必定自動去探求衛生的道路，在實施時引起兒童發生興趣。應多從積極方面着手，例如對於殘酷兇猛的霍亂病，應告訴兒童不食生吃的東西，未煮沸的水，腐壞的瓜菓、及注射霍亂預防針，霍亂病雖然甚似洪水獸的危害，我們也可避免其害的，假若僅從消極方面告知兒童，霍亂病死亡率是如何的高超，流行狀况是如何的兇猛，而不指示兒童對於霍亂正當的預防方法，使兒童對於霍亂有研究的興趣，反而增進兒童恐怖的心理，所以引起兒童對於衛生的興趣，在實施時，多用積極而少用消極的方面。</p>
<p>二　健康教育實施的原則</p>
<p>一•採用有興趣之敎材和方法例如繪畫一個羸瘦的人，旁邊再用一塊豆腐陪襯，及一個健康强壯的入，解釋給兒童了解圖畫上的意義，若贏瘦的入，常食豆漿，就可有成爲健壯入的可能，這種敎材和方法，就是暗示兒童要食滋養品之價值。</p>

<p>— 郭人驥</p>
<p>因此之故。霉雨期中。對於黴菌類之發育。允須注意。且防止蠅之發生。在其初期。卽考慮其驅除法。甚爲緊要。防止黴菌之繁殖旣難。允以霉雨期中。對於菌類。如前所述。天時地利。俱備更爲不易。茲先自一般言之。務須力求作成防制黴菌發育之條伴。例如室溫。務令降低。避開濕氣。凡屬衣服被褥等之處置。宜俟天晴之日。曝於日光中。使之乾燥。箱櫉衣櫃•均須開放於流通之空氣中·又附有飲食物之汚物。如前所述。含有繁殖黴菌類之充足養分。故此等汚物。必須充分拂拭而除去之。若旣發見菌類發育之經路。宜用昇汞水石炭酸等消毒液充分殺菌。然此法不能應用於飲食物。良以殺滅黴菌之消毒液。人類亦受其同樣之危害。黴菌之養分。旣與人類之食物相同。黴菌之菌體成分。亦全與人類相同。故能毒黴菌者。亦必能毒入類也。對於處置飲食物最佳之方法。厥爲將物再　通過於火中。普通有害於人體之徽菌。加以煮沸。卽能死滅。然飲食物苟爲黴菌破壞過甚者。加以煮沸。其菌雖死。然爲菌所分解血發生之化學的有毒物質。尚未至化爲無毒之程度。又含有於菌體內之菌體內毒素。此等物質。對熱。均有强大之抵抗力。卽使其菌盡死。然因飲食此等之故。亦起中毒。已腐敗者。雖經煮沸。亦以勿食爲佳。而允須注意其勿使變腐。凡易腐之物。均爲徽菌之所好。而黴菌之所愛好者。亦卽人類之所愛好者也。人類愛好適當之　味與甘味。微菌亦愛好之。然過鹹之飲食物鹹菜之類。與甚甜之糕餅蜜餞等。有害於黴菌。概不繁殖。試觀挿過白糖中或食鹽中之牙扦等。雖放置長久。亦不腐敗。是因白糖食鹽。不能爲黴　所附着。有使牙扦成爲消毒之意義。故也。（完）</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>若患者接吻之禁止，哺乳之禁止，結婚與吾之整正考慮，以及飲服牛乳之注意；這幾件事情，都能使結核菌易於傳播，幷有利於本症之進行的，在預防敎則上也應該加以嚴密注意方好。</p>
<p>根據殺滅結核菌之原理，產生上述的種種預防規條，總算盡人力之所能了；但對於防止結核菌之散漫於周圍一層，我們總不敢答應，說已完全辦到。這是無可奈何的！所以對於開放性之本症患者，最好送至專門療養院，行隔離的手續，爲唯一之上策；這是完全爲患者家族以及接近的人們畢生幸福起見，簡捷了當的說一句：係爲整個之社會；决不能目以「不近人情」：「忍心害理」的。</p>
<p>第二節　積極的預防</p>
<p>上面已經說過，關於本症之預防方針，除開設法撲滅社會上之結核菌外：應該使人人養成卽使結核菌侵入體內亦得以防禦之體質的，這就是現在所講的「積極的預防」了！我們曉得，社會上結核菌之完全消滅，係很難成爲事實的；所以關於積極方面之種種，比較前者，似乎來得更加重要。</p>
<p>如何卽能增進人體對於結核傳染之防禦力呢？一言以盡之，卽利用最偉大之自然力是已！這是凡在人類之列都可儘量享受的！關於這方面所包括，係有空氣日光及水三者之應用的。此中的詳情，現在且分述於下面：</p>

<p>時間和空間，像是宇宙的經緯，我們渺小而短促的人生，在這大自然裏，莫怪要把字宙常做神秘了。然而生在二十四紀的我們，試看這宇宙現有的一切物像，不都是祖先遺留下發明的嗎？在短促的一生中，正可造成偉大的事業，「時間是我們的戰馬，」這話可作我們座右銘。</p>
<p>人，是一種有惰性的動物，同時又是富有慾望的一個人，如果不需要什麼，那末什麼都不做。當許多人立志要幹一件事，常會有這種問題：「從什麼時候做起呢？」我相信最普通的答案，當然是「明天」兩個字。然而明天是一個極奇怪的東西，天天用得着的寶貝。於是人類在社會上，許多燦爛而偉大的事業，都可斷送在這「明天」兩字上了。</p>

<p>居家屋字進深的，爲防宵小光顧，大門自不得不雖設常關。又恐有人見訪，十叩九不開；因此宅主裝起門鈴。在內進懸以鈴，以繩引之至大門外；復於繩端，繫以銅圈或鐵圈。這樣，門外人可省却叩門之勞。只消把圈重重地一製，自然裏面鈴聲丁當，報道有人來了。近有裝電鈴的，更覺便利，不過一按指之煩而已。</p>
<p>門鈴始於何時，頗不易考，然唐代官署中已有裝門鈴的。鄭綮詩：絛鈴無響閟珠宮。」「絛鈴」卽門鈴。韓偓亦有詩云：「坐久忽聞鈴索動，玉堂西畔響丁朿。」「玉堂」乃翰林院；以此證鄭詩，則「珠宮」亦指翰林院可知。按翰林院爲內廷供奉之所。玄宗別置學士院，後遂兼翰林之稱，爲翰林學士，侍直禁廷，專司制誥。「珠宮」。「玉堂」，無非喻翰林院地位之崇高而已。</p>
<p>制誥乃天子詔令；換言之，翰林院乃一國政令擬辦機關，自宜如何嚴密，况又逼近禁廷·裝門鈴，所以表示翰院重地，閒人莫入。李德裕云：「翰林院有懸鈴，以備警急文字引之以代傳呼也。唐制：禁署嚴密，非本院人，雖有公事，不敢遽入於內；內官宣事，亦先引鈴。每有文書卽，內臣立於門外；鈴聲動，本院小判官出受訖，授院使，院使授學士。」味鄭韓李三家之說，那時翰林院所裝的門鈴，大概與現今所裝的繩鈴相同。</p>
<p>近今各機關辦公室內，或置呌人鐘，或設對話機，較之唐代引鈴以代傳呼，更加便利了。</p>

<p>龍華寺隔鄰，有一所「血華」紀念廟，是用來紀念陣亡將官的，那裏共築了四個小亭，內貯着方形的紀念碑，正面刻：「國民革命軍第三十二師陣亡將官姓氏」。餘則均刻着將官們的姓氏。也許是政府要鼓勵民衆吧！所以這裏是日夜開放着，無論何人都可進去參觀；又加栽些樹木花草之類，到了春秋佳日，更受游人的歡迎。但是我國民衆，一向是不注重道德的，除了游息之外，便在紀念碑上，留下一些大筆，所謂「×××游此」的字跡，竟佔滿了每一個紀念碑，那些將官的們姓氏，已被埋沒而無法辨認了。</p>
<p>近來更有人異想天開的在碑正中，寫着五個毛筆天字道：「來者請留名」。我暗想，寫的人，不是幽默大師，便是滑稽專家。</p>

<p>— 南丁</p>
<p>蹦蹦名角朱實霞，是開上海蹦蹦戲的紀錄，而使蹦蹦在上海有優越地位的大功臣。自在新世界飯店和小廣寒輟演之後，曾到東北，靑島，南京，因伊的藝術精絕，到處都受人歡迎，聞上海人士闊別已有，一年，此决重行來滬，出演於黃金，又轟動了全僩上海，只是因戲院的關係，不到十天，便即輟演，使歡迎朱寶霞的觀衆，大爲失望，後來在榮金大戲院演唱，期間是七天，七天之後，在大世界長時間登台，這自然是愛好朱寶霞藝術的人的絕好消息。前天有人談起朱寶霞的身世和藝術，極爲有趣，現在記在下面。</p>
<p>朱實霞的父親，名喚聚賢，是個蹦蹦世家，在北方很有些聲譽，如今已有六十多歲，此决同朱寶霞一起來滬，朱的蹦蹦藝術，都由於家傳，在六歲時，便開始學習蹦蹦。這時白玉霜已十四歲，也從聚賢習戲，所以白玉霜和朱寶霞，還是師姊妹的稱呼。</p>
<p>學繃蹦戲最難的一點，便是苦戲的當場掉淚·朱寶霞學的時候，會下過一番苦功，往往在黑暗無光的地方，點一枝香，睜足了眼睛，向香火頭注視，以眼酸流淚爲度，這般的練習不停，自然可以到立刻可以掉淚地步。朱寶霞的「貧女淚」，「鋸碗釘」，「楊三姐告狀」等戲，所以能使人感動，淚下如雨，便是這般的練成。白玉霜却沒有練過這功夫，便不宜演這一類感人的苦戲。</p>
<p>朱寶霞在十一歲，便登台唱戲，到了十五歲的一年，因伊的姿色嬌艷，風流可人，被長腿將軍所瞧中。這時的軍閥，權勢是何等的煊赫，朱寶霞便在武力之下，被張所佔據。伊這時並不叫寶霞，却叫做小寶。這是民國十五年的事情。</p>
<p>民國十七年，正是張宗昌逃出國境的時候，他的姬妾，大都風流雲散，各奔前程，朱寶霞自然也是裏面的一個。但是因了朱的歸張，日期太短，並不如亞仙等的可以得到鉅欵，所以出來之後，不得不重理舊業，演蹦蹦爲生，好在伊的藝術，也並沒有生疏，反血因了在休息時間的努力，越發精進。加以伊的嬌媚神情，美麗面貌，一出台後，即轟動了華北，成了個蹦蹦名角。</p>
<p>在表面上，好似朱寶霞和白玉霜，是立於敵對的地位，實際却是不然，朱白兩人的交誼，非常濃厚，常在一起遊玩，便是朱在浦東出演的時候，白玉霜還特地渡江訪朱，兩人的交誼，便可想而知了。</p>

<p>國器道：我也並沒有什麼意思，不過要先覩爲快罷了。再見再見。他說過這話，是真正的回家了。晚飯以後，少不得要在坐燈下，看上幾頁書。可是今天的心思，有些慌亂了。靜坐下來，立刻在腦筋裏面，泛出杏花下面溫到的那位女郎。自己很覺得那女郎的相，有點像這維納絲，因之再向桌上的維納絲注意着時，他似乎也現出滿臉的笑容，向自己看着來了。於是左手拿過那神像放到面前，右手却伸了一個食指，在像的臉上，慢慢撫換着。輕輕兒自言自語道：也端莊，也活潑，也康健，也斯不他太美麗了。平山所盡的，就是他嗎？那未免太唐突了，這種女子，怎好讓書店裏印刷出來作販賣品呢。這時，房門推着響，章老太太來了。國器站起來道：媽還沒有睡？章老太道：我是剛才要陲的。你怎麼一僩人在這裏說話？國器笑道：我是有一篇小說要做，自己在這裏揣摸着說話人的口氣，以後下筆就道樣動手。章太太道：已經夜深了，你睡覺罷。他說着伸手將門給反帶上了，而且站在外邊道：你脫衣服上床去睡罷，我等你息了燈再走呢。國器想到晚上天氣很凉，不能讓母親站着在堂屋裏，口裏催母親去睡便息了燈。可是章老太却等他在床上翻身作嚮才走開呢。到了决日早上起來，還是個晴天，國器很高興的下床，忽忽漱洗已畢，連茶水也米不及喝一口，却比每日上學的時候，更提早二三十分鐘出門。由他家裏到學堂裹，本來可以走兩條小巷子直穿過去的，但是他似乎把熟路走成了一種煩膩，今天却繞了一個很大的蠶子，向墻如露出杏花的那條巷子走去。他手上帶了一隻手表呢，走過一條巷子，就要抬起手表來看看。分明是計算着一種時間與速度的關係。馒慢的走着，慢慢的忖度着，偶然轉過一條巷子口，不由得吃了一鷺，不但是站住了還猛可的向後退了一步，正是那一位像維納絲的姑娘，走到面前來了。他似乎也有吃驚的樣子，身子向後縮着，把脇下夾的那個書包，一頭向下滑落着，幾乎耍落到地上來。他自己也感到了有失檢點，微微的一笑，立刻又把笑容收起來，低着頭走了過去。（二六）</p>

<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>最近登祚的英皇愛德華八世，是誕生於一八九四年的，到現在年僅四十三歲。這種年輕的皇上，雖然並非少見·但是年過四十，而還是獨身着，那是不多的，他在成年的時候，適逢世界大戰。登位時候，又逢軍縮會議决裂，第二决大戰行將爆發之時。他的命運是十分艱苦的。就是在做皇太子的時候，有時到殖民地去旅行，都是含有幾分政治趣味，所以他在未登極前，差不多早已代了英皇喬治去巡狩邊土了。</p>
<p>世界大戰時，他是牛津大學裏的一個學生。開戰後第四日，他被任爲近衛聯隊少尉，便向陸軍大臣，要求加入前綫，說他有四個弟兄，就是着了彈，也沒有關係的。陸軍大臣因爲他是英國最長的太子，如何肯放他出去。便對他說道：「並非因着彈的問題，如若皇太子不幸而被敵國俘虜，試問將如之何？」於是這位皇太子只好掃興而去。</p>
<p>他不大喜歡住在宮裏的，最以接近平民爲快樂，故有「平民皇帝」之稱。民國十一年他到日本遊歷。在日光看見了特異的人力車，忽發奇想的定要嘗試一下，迫着隨從武官坐在上面，拖了一回車。那知已被記者攝得，在明天的報上披露出來。招待官員，認爲有失太子的面于，連忙囑報紙設法消毀。但是拖人力車的英太子的照片，仍留存於日本，此决太子登極時，這一張照片，又在報紙上發現了。</p>
<p>愛德華八世在做太子時，最喜歡運動，高爾夫，足球，游泳，狩獵等等，沒有一樣不喜歡的。他在求學時，會於白金漢宮中招集少年十一人，組織一足球隊。後來有九人參加大戰，傷了四人，戰死四人。</p>
<p>大戰以後，他的生活，大半過於海外的，他說「海是我的宗敎，」洵非虛語。至一九三二年爲止，他已走過二十寓哩以上了。英國政治家中最喜歡旅行的是麥克唐，還不及他的五分之一。他不但能划船，並且可以親自駕駛飛機，意相墨沙里尼不能專美於前了</p>
<p>到美國訪問的時候，極受美人歡迎，每天來和他握手的達數千人。到後來右手覺因握手太多而腫脹，以左手代巷的。在白姆海岸避署時候，遇着大批的電影女明星，都是亳不客氣的喊着太子的名字，像喊伊們的戀人一樣。他雖然被這一羣美人魚包圍着，却仍是無動於中，直保持到現在。英太子不但在幼年時，十分天眞，到了中年時候，還是不脫孩子氣，故有「大孩子」的綽號。</p>

<h3 id="c216">洋米一年中輸入達千餘萬公担 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>據國際調查局發表統計，去年一年，洋米輪入，洋米輪入，較上年增加，達五百二十餘萬公担，一千八百五十七萬餘金單位，去年上半年進口數量，一一·一八六千公担，下半年一•七七八千公担，共計一二·九六四千公担，考其增加原因，當以前年國內災荒頻仍，產量下减，致米商向外產訂購云云，我國號稱產米之區，現在我國之米，非但不能向外輪出，反而向外洋訂購，一年之中，竟連一千餘萬公担之鉅，宜乎中國農村之破產矣。</p>
<p>國以民爲本，民以食爲天，民食之於國家，原屬極關重要，若民食取給於外洋，則國家經濟卽漏出外洋，實爲國家之一大損失，查洋米大量輪入原因，一方面，果然因國內災荒頻仍，而另一方面，則因奸商惟利是圖，訂購洋米，價格旣賤，而利息較厚，因此洋米充斥，而國內之米，價格不能提高，穀賤傷農，原爲定則，百物昂貴，而米價獨賤，農民躬耕所得，不足以資溫飽，於是多舍農村而趨都市，此農村之所以急激崩潰也。</p>
<p>江浙兩省，本屬多米之地，而近日搶米抗祖風潮，層見迭出，此係社會極危險，極不安之狀態，决不能以尋常小小問題目之也。近據報載，浙財廳以浙江各縣田賦，歷年收入减少，迭次派員坐催，均難使稅收增加，特派該廳顧問等，赴各地考察，並加嚴催，若照目下情形，力田旣不足以資生存，則田不願種，而業主則畸田而不能收租，則田不欲畸，勢必廣地自荒，我國本爲農業國，而農業破產矣，若爲工業國，則我國之工業，比較各國，實等於零，然則國家將何法圖存耶。</p>
<p>聞近日嘉興嘉善等處，業主欠完賦稅，已達七年之久，現在當局派員嚴追，限七月之內，將歷年欠完賦稅，一併繳楚，各業主以糧從租出，歷年荒歉，租無從收，旣不收租，賦何從出，其少有資財者，則去而之他，其經濟困難者，則惟有聽其吃官司而已，惟查該處農民，因歷年荒歉，無法還租者固多，然亦有假荒歉之名，故意抗租者，亦屬不少，業戶若控之於官，而官不受理，卽使受理，亦並不嚴追，如是租旣不肯繳納，而賦則必須完淸，如是欲使農民耕田，而業主完賦，此事從何說起也。</p>
<p>並且此風一開，則他處必須效尤，耕田而不必還租，農民無不樂此，影響所及，勢必全國糜然，若謂當局必須實行耕者有田之制，則亦必須耕者有其田，亦卽耕者完其賦，斷不能使耕者有其田，而使不耕者完其賦也，故現在當務之急，一面宜禁止洋米進口，一面嚴追田戶欠租，二者必須並進，若洋米入口少，則國內之米價自增，米價旣高，則農民之生活，自能活動，而亦不致抗租矣，近年各地，時見荒歉，農民無法還租者固屬不少，此種農民自應准其免還租米，而業戶亦自應准其免賦，若田旣不荒，而不肯還租，則官廳應該嚴加追取，而近日各處地方官廳，辦理徵租事件，多是並不上緊，敷衍塞責，拘禁旬餘，卽算了事，田租不追而專追田賦，此亦未得事理之平者也。</p>
<h3 id="c217">賣買 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>自從每年一决盛大的賽會停止之後，直角鎭上的春天該是生意最淸淡的時候了。那些男人女人，免强度過了那個可怕的嚴冬，在農忙沒有開始，都利用這機會帮人家做短工，積幾個錢來做種田本。我們的雜貨店，過了元宵節，就沒有生意做，但是種田的肥料和夏天應用的物品，像蚊虫藥，痧藥…都應該現在採辦足，到田里開始播種，我們店里又分不開人手了，因爲我和父親就是店里的老闆和伙計：直角鎭沒有一家店另外僱佣店員的，實在這小鎭上的賣買是太難做了。我每年就帮着父親冬天收賬，春天辦貨，萬興雜貨店總算在直角鎭上站住了脚。</p>
<p>今年照傷到石門灣去採辦貨物。從直角鎭到石門灣有一天一夜的水程。從前每隔三天就有一班航船開行，她果沒有多担擱，六天可以打轉回的。但是最近乘客太稀少了，航船上打不出終年僱佣着三個搖櫓手的開銷，航船就沒有固定的開行班次了。它要等着有相當人數的乘客，這樣，常常航船開出之後，不見它開回來。</p>
<p>我在直角採辦了貨物，到埠頭上去問航船老大的時候，他坐在船頭上抽旱烟袋，向我打過招呼，就眼睛望着天告訴我：「已經有二個人來問過了，現在連你三個，恐怕還要等兩天吧？但是天色不正，說不定今天晚上要下雨，那就說不定了……」</p>
<p>老大的臉永遠是那樣死板板地，他的嘆氣有時多於他的說話。但是喝過三杯白乾，就會抓着一個人說個不停的，他告訴人：從父親手里接來這艘航船，就沒有碰到過現在這樣的年頭，七天開一班，二十天打一個來回，我們船上四條命靠沒有來着？家里還老娘兒子呢！於是他拼命喝酒，打跌著回到船上的時候，就找夥計們嘔氣，老子不幹這天雷劈的航船了！大家散夥，船身起岸劈柴燒，帶幾個盤纏上梁山做强盜去！</p>
<p>伙計們知道老大的脾氣，大家靠着航船吃飯，沒有生意嘔什麼鳥的氣，把他扶進艙里睡覺。第二天他醒來就向伙計們打招呼：「昨天又灌醉了，眞是要不得！我說了什麼話嗎？」眼睛望着天抽他的旱烟袋了。</p>
<p>果眞，那天我從埤頭上回到客寓就下雨了，浙浙瀝　地　夜滴到天亮。去年到四鄉去收賬，下大雪，在客萬里關到年底才回家，今年辦貨又碰到下雨天，航船不知要到什麼時候才能開回直角鎭？想着就夜沒有好睡。但是有什麼用呢？雨繼續下了五天，第六天放晴，再趕到埠頭上去時，伙計告訴我老大上酒店喝酒去了。</p>
<p>我再到酒店，老大一把拖住我，舌頭打着結說：「來，喝幾杯。明天開船了，石門灣沒有乘客，直角鎭上的乘客不是要咒我老大嗎？」他掄着指頭，『哼，又是九天了！」</p>
<p>那天他沒有喝醉，從酒店里出來，帮我到客寓里帶了貨上船。他一面關照伙計去通知來過打聽開船的乘客，原來還是六天前的二個。二個都是我們鎭上人，一個開米店的，一個到石門灣來打不着短工，要回家種田去了。</p>
<p>我們很快地談上了。大家覺得應該替航船老大想個辦法，使航船照舊規定三天一班，那個樣子就沒有人敢出門，十天半個月的住客寓，不是够家里兩涸月的坐吃嗎？</p>
<p>「眞是偷鷄不着蝕把米！」打短工的拍拍他的腰包，「打一個月短工，還賠了一吊錢！」</p>
<p>米店老闆也想到了自家的生意，憤憤地說：「新穀上市的時候，便宜貨都被大米行包了去，一到開春，米價馬上漲了上去，吃自家的米還得賠錢，稻田有什麼　頭？還要賠上客寓錢，船　，這勢口窮人祇有餓死！」</p>
<p>我望着艙角里自己一堆貨物，那些用現錢批來的肥料，一放賬出去，總得年底見錢，那還是田里有收成的話：要是種田人一落空，那里去要錢？春天沒有生意做，夏天把現錢變了貨物賒出去，經過秋天，收賬還是沒有把握，做這項賣買眞是太危險了。</p>
<p>我們在船艙里談話，老大却在船尾上獨自把杯，大概又是灌飽了，推了後艙的船板探進身來說：</p>
<p>「這勢口做鳥的賣買！船到直角鎭馬上起岸，聽便多少錢賣去，我要上梁山做强盜了！」</p>
<p>三個伙計也從後面探進身來，在煤油燈光下，每個入的臉上都像罩着一層濃霜似的。</p>

<p>銘底病漸漸沉重起來了。每天，他躺在那舖着已經發灰的被單的床上，低低地呻吟。好像要把疾病給　的痛苦一點點一點點地從嘴裏吐出來。然而，他沒有這樣大的力量，呻吟成了無限期的延續。</p>
<p>當我和林一同去看他的時候，他苦　　伸出瘦弱的手臂，那臉色正如同久　的天氣中忽然　出陽光，又被乾枯得　　烟　色的皮　　　　了　成了　樣難看，比起乾枯的橘子皮來，只是他還有一雙流着渴望與希冀的光的眼睛。雖然也沒有什麼精神了；但是，這雙眼睛就是生與死之間的唯一的界限，假如死底黑翼把他抱住，這眼睛一定深深地陷下去，永逝了光明。</p>
<p>他就用那對眼睛對我們望着，有時就用眼睛說出他要說的話。嗓子似乎已經沙啞了，濃凝的痰塊把他曾經洪亮的吼呌的聲調撕成破碎了。他說：</p>
<p>——我很戚謝你們呀，……坐吧！我，……我頂盼望一個人來陪著我，談</p>
<p>我和林都不要他多說話。我是知道的，他身上的傷痕也許還沒有好，肺部的震動更不會復原，說不定那殘酷的菌類已經把它吃光了。</p>
<p>——你不合適多說話，這多天了還不好，是很討厭的事，你只耍靜靜地休息，病是會好的。</p>
<p>他點着頭。又用那嘶啞的聲調說下去：</p>
<p>——我也這樣想，可是，我一點也不能够安靜。我想到你們的時候，更是不能安靜，我生怕你們遭遇到比我還壞的事……</p>
<p>——　要多想吧！我們是知遠的。</p>
<p>我說。有　　，林　淒地　著眉，　著沉思的　　。我知道，他又在把生</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>與死做比較了。他會對我說：</p>
<p>——這兩天，，我每天受到不知道多一少刺激了。在茶花女中的馬格里蒂，復一活里的格蒂沙，都給我了許多苦痛，昨一天，我又親眼看見一輛汽車把一個活生一生地在路上走着的人壓死了，……</p>
<p>而今天他又看到這病勢沉重的銘，他底要好的朋友，正一隻脚站在生，一隻脚站在死的時候，他所受的刺激當然會比那些些都重大。</p>
<h3 id="c219">「想起從前淚　　！」 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>我就告訴他：想他跟銘談一下話，我知道銘是很需要我們多告訴他一下我們底近况的，一個病重的人，他對於生的希冀是最大了。允其是銘，眼看自己底事不能去做，朋友底事他是自然地關懷了。</p>
<p>——銘，——林說：——我們很好，那個讀書班已經成立起來，學生很好，你底幾個學生也都到我們這裏來了，我敎國語，他敎英文，他們都很高興學</p>
<p>這些話就像一服有力的藥，銘底病有些减輕了似的；眼睛裏閃着熱情的光。我看着他高興的臉，和可愛的天眞的笑容，補充着林底話：</p>
<p>——他們希望你快些好了，他們要來看你，我用「不便利」的話把他們說開了。……你快些好了吧！……</p>
<p>他甚至於笑起來了。太陽光從他臉上耀過一樣。</p>
<p>——我也這樣想：快些好了吧！以前，我不知道死的可怕，像不知道自由的眞實的價值如何一樣。從那决失掉自由，我方懂得一個人對於自由的愛護與渴望的原因；從和死接近，我才明白了生的可貴，但是，……你看我還能好嗎？……樣瘦弱了，……</p>
<p>他底少微高大一點的聲調又低落下去了。像剛剛落過一陣雨一樣寂靜。用那對發着疑問的光的眼睛望着我，急待我底回答，手也抬起來，好像要我從他底身體上得到一個最正確的解答。</p>
<p>我望着他，從絕望裏找出希望來，說：</p>
<p>——那是一定會好的，我們兩個保證你會好。</p>
<p>這樣，他才收回了那懷疑的眼光，快慰的笑了一笑。好像一個得到特赦的命令的囚犯一樣歡喜。於是，他說：</p>
<p>——你們回去吧，你們還有事要做。……我雖然想跟你們多談一會兒，可是也不願誤你們的事，……好，你們走吧，……替我問他們好，……</p>
<p>我們握了握他底手，走出房門來，輕輕地帶上房門，下着樓梯。</p>
<p>林又像得到一個定理了似地跟我說：</p>
<p>——一　站在生與死之問的人是頂可愛的人物了。他對於我們這樣牛龍活虎似的人，是充滿了羨慕的心情的，當我們站在他跟前就好像又重新把生從人間帶給他了，你看銘，他多高興…</p>
<p>——不過，我看他底病是不怎麼好的……</p>
<p>我低聲說着，回頭望了一望關着的房門。</p>

<p>『近天天氣極冷，河面結極厚之冰，好容易今天捉到一條大青魚』這是漁夫陳大對農夫張二所說的話，於此談話之際，隊大便產生了些小運，因爲王鎭上的富翁王壽明天是五士大壽，正巧因爲近天河面結冰所以有錢買不到靑魚，無論出了何等軍價，當然囉！陳大不能失此小財便飛也似地跑到富翁王壽家裏，以此稀少之靑魚，博得主人的喜迎，易得重價。</p>
<p>富翁的門房王二，其性驕遨，以爲農人可欺，定要與陳大把魚易得之代價平分於他，吾則不得進，然陳大雖爲漁夫，但亦善於用計，因此允他把魚所得之無論何種酬報皆平分之，於是陳大携魚入內，王壽大喜，問其欲金幾何，陳大答曰：『我願得一百下手心之代價，王　大奇，然只得依從，因吾則不作交易耳！一二三四五……打至五十下時陳大却說餘五十下留給門房王二，因這是在門房內所訂二人之公的也。把所得無論何種酬報皆平分之，王壽聞此大怒，把王二重打五十下，並割其職，所以諸位小朋友，因王二想貪小，於是反而失大，故貪小者必失大也。</p>

        <h1>1936.05.26</h1>
<h3 id="e1">External Memorial Week Zhang Qun Speaks on Sino-Japanese Relations, Emphasizing a Swift, Thorough Adjustment Through Open and Sincere Discussions on a Proper Path; Anti-Smuggling Efforts in North China Remain Largely Ineffective, Improvement Possible with a Change of Heart from Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the External Affairs Ministry's memorial week gathering on the 25th at 10 a.m., Foreign Minister Zhang delivered a detailed speech on the latest international situation, analyzing the relations between various countries. His exposition on Sino-Japanese relations was particularly insightful. He stated that China is willing to exert its utmost effort to maintain good relations with its neighbors, which is inevitable. Given the shared race, culture, and other similarities between China and Japan, it is self-evident that they should cooperate and seek mutual development. However, since the September 18th Incident, unprecedented international turmoil has occurred, gradually alienating the people of both countries, increasing friction, and deepening suspicion. The complex situation often defies conventional solutions, causing deep concern among informed individuals in both countries, who are eager to find ways to restore the proper relationship between the two governments and peoples. Since former Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota introduced the principle of non-aggression and non-threat towards neighboring countries in the 68th Diet session, although there has been no clear implementation plan and no significant results, the sincere desire and effort to maintain peace have been widely understood. With Minister Hirota's recent promotion to Prime Minister and Ambassador Arima's transfer to Foreign Minister, there seems to be no fundamental change in Japan's foreign policy. Recently, Foreign Minister Arima outlined his strategy in the 69th Diet session, aiming to ensure stability in East Asia and contribute to world peace through the establishment of international trust and the promotion of human welfare. This is not only Japan's national policy but also the common desire of the people of East Asia. Given the current situation between China and Japan, failure to seek a thorough adjustment of diplomatic relations promptly would not only be detrimental to both countries but also affect peace in East Asia. Therefore, since assuming the position of Foreign Minister, I have been determined to advocate for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations through diplomatic means. Japan seems to share this determination, but unfortunately, concrete discussions on adjustment methods and issues have yet to begin. From China's perspective, any issue aimed at promoting the welfare of both countries and consolidating peace in East Asia is subject to adjustment. Any method based on reciprocity, equality, and mutual respect for sovereignty can be considered a good strategy for adjustment. In short, adjustment should not be limited to a specific area or issue, nor should it be a temporary solution for immediate appeasement, but rather a long-term plan for the permanent co-existence of both nations. Even if there are unfortunate grievances between China and Japan, there are no eternal enemies, and there is always a way to restore harmony. The responsibility for resolving conflicts and restoring good relations lies with practical politicians of both sides today, who possess foresight and perseverance. I sincerely hope that responsible authorities on both sides will consider the big picture, make their utmost efforts to establish goodwill and understanding, eliminate the root causes of hostility, and promptly engage in open and sincere discussions through proper channels, recognizing each other's positions and difficulties. Merely pointing out vague principles and criticizing each other, or resorting to threats and retaliation, will not be helpful. Instead, concrete issues of mutual benefit should be discussed thoroughly to seek appropriate and fair solutions. Japan's desire for foreign trade aims to develop its national economy without resorting to modern economic blocs or economic warfare. Since Japan aims to develop its national economy, it should sympathize with and welcome the improvement of situations that could undermine the economic foundation of China, with whom it is economically interdependent. For example, the current large-scale smuggling into northern China is hindering legitimate trade for both Chinese and foreign merchants, leading to the decline of markets, shaking the economic foundation, and causing significant losses to the national treasury. Although our customs authorities have been doing their best to prevent smuggling, obstacles abound, and efforts have been ineffective. If Japan truly wants to cooperate with China, a simple change of heart and a slight effort can immediately improve this situation. Japan often expresses concern about the communist insurgency in parts of China. With the close ties of modern international relations, the stability of one country affects its neighbors, which we deeply understand. Therefore, the Chinese government has been making every effort to suppress the communists for several years, and most of them have been wiped out. China is confident that it can completely eliminate the remaining insurgents in due course. Under no circumstances will China abandon its anti-communist policy, nor will it tolerate any organization with opposing ideologies seeking to overthrow the existing political system through violence within its borders. In recent years, the efforts of the Chinese people have been solely focused on national rejuvenation and development through self-reliance and mutual assistance. We do not engage in alliances or distant diplomacy, but seek self-preservation at home and coexistence in the international arena. We not only want to make our utmost effort to ensure our own security but also wish to work with all relevant countries to ensure peace in East Asia. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) According to a certain important figure in Hebei-Chahar, there has been no formal contact regarding diplomacy in North China. Since Mr. Tashiro's arrival, there has been no formal expression. However, he is said to be quite upright and is not likely to affect diplomatic progress due to the change of commanders. There is no issue in Tokyo and the North China military regarding the abolition of the puppet government in eastern Hebei, only the Kwantung Army is still studying and observing. Once their internal opinions are unified, a resolution can be achieved. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan has recovered from his throat ailment and resumed his duties as usual on the 25th. He will go to Chahar for inspection at the beginning of next month. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Captain Takeshita, the usual commander of the Japanese military police, came to Tianjin to visit Colonel Fujii, the commander of the Japanese military police headquarters. He will return to Peiping on the 27th to take over. Matsumuro held a banquet for Song, Qin, Chen, and others in Peiping on the evening of the 24th to introduce Imai Kiyoshi, the head of the weapons section of the Ministry of the Army. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chen Zhongfu said that there is no definite date for the resolution of the Hebei issue. The rumors of a withdrawal within ten days are not yet true. Matsumuro returned to Peiping and said that he would continue to discuss the outstanding matters. There is no new demand being made by the Japanese. The crackdown on drug trafficking is progressing smoothly. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The measures to prevent smuggling via railways have been promulgated. The implementing rules, jointly formulated by the Ministries of Finance and Railways and submitted to the Executive Yuan, have been approved and should be forwarded to the customs and railway bureaus for effective implementation. The original text of the detailed rules consists of seven articles. The main points are the procedures for transporting foreign goods by rail, the method of operation between the originating station and the destination station, and the cooperation between the customs and railways.

<p>(Tianjin) Lin Shi-ze went to Peiping for anti-smuggling matters and visited Song again to seek instructions. The customs is still urging the Beining Railway to assist in implementing the new central government measures. According to a responsible person from the customs, two types of new anti-smuggling laws have been received. The first type has too many obstacles and cannot be implemented. The second type is difficult to fully implement due to the railway's hesitation. Reluctantly, they will implement a part of it. The central government will soon promulgate another separate law adapted to the environment in North China, at which time the railway should be able to cooperate. However, they are not sure whether it will be effective after implementation. A certain country plans to organize a large-scale smuggling and freight company, purchasing dozens of heavy-duty vehicles to operate between the coast of eastern Hebei and Peiping and Tianjin, from Jianchangying to Beidaihe, from Beidaihe to Tangshan, from Tangshan to Tianjin and Peiping, paving gravel roads for motor vehicles, intending to bypass our central railway anti-smuggling facilities, as a long-term transportation group organization. It is rumored that a certain country is also lobbying for a reduction in North China tariffs, intending to undermine our tariff barriers. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is rumored that the Beining Railway has agreed in principle to allow customs officers to enter stations for anti-smuggling purposes, provided that it does not interfere with train operations. The railway will not refuse if the customs can assume the diplomatic responsibilities arising from anti-smuggling. The establishment of inspection stations along the line is currently under study and will be implemented after a decision is made. Chen Juesheng returned to Tianjin from Peiping on the 25th.

<h3 id="e5">Suma Summoned Back to Japan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry yesterday telegraphed Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, ordering him to return to Japan immediately. This morning, the Consul General telegraphed that he had complied with the order and departed from Shanghai by ship. According to sources in diplomatic circles, the Japanese government recently secretly telegraphed acting chargé d'affaires Wakasugi and Suma, together with military attachés, to probe the Chinese government's true attitude in Nanjing. Suma's urgent summons back to Japan is to report his impressions from the probe to the head of the Foreign Ministry and Ambassador Kawagoe to discuss countermeasures. It is said that Suma also brought an important suggestion, advocating that Kawagoe should immediately propose concrete measures based on the "Three Principles" after taking office and urge the Chinese government to implement them.

<h3 id="e6">American Newspapers Pay Attention to Japan's Troop Increase in North China and Smuggling Incidents <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Deeply Concerned About Japan's Actions</p>
<p>(New York) Today, all major newspapers here carried reports on Japan's troop increase in North China and the smuggling issue. Today's editorial in The New York Times stated that smuggling in North China has almost become a tool of Japan's national policy, as can be seen from the protests of Britain and the United States to Tokyo. In recent weeks, Japanese smuggling in North China has become increasingly serious, not only affecting British and American trade but also undermining the dignity of Chinese customs. The intention is nothing more than to force the separation of customs administration in Hebei and Chahar provinces. If this becomes a reality, the two provinces will exist in name only, and the prestige of the central government will be further diminished. Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Arima spoke in the House of Peers about adjusting Sino-Japanese relations to promote peace in East Asia. However, Western friends of Japan believe that it is difficult to believe that its dual policy of economic and military pressure can contribute to peace in China and the world. In addition, the newspaper published an article by Nathaniel Peffer today, stating that the conflict in the Far East has now become economic. Although the open door policy in China still exists in law, it no longer exists in fact. Japan is increasing its military presence in North China and encouraging smuggling, making it impossible for other countries to gain a foothold. Britain sent Sir Leith-Ross to China to help China, and Japan threatened with the autonomy of Hebei and Chahar. Now the United States has also provided monetary assistance to China. Although it is still difficult to predict how the situation will develop, there are many indications that Japan intends to take further action in North China. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Embassy Report Confirms Japanese and Korean Involvement in Smuggling; Japanese Military Authorities Forbid Anti-Smuggling Personnel from Carrying Weapons</p>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, members asked many questions about the smuggling issue in North China. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the report from the British representative in Peiping on the issue is currently under review. The information he has received confirms that customs officials and anti-smuggling ships patrolling the coast in the demilitarized zone of North China are prohibited from carrying weapons by the Japanese military authorities. There is also reason to believe that Chinese customs officers are also encountering difficulties on trains passing through the demilitarized zone. The main figures engaged in smuggling are Japanese and Koreans, with some Chinese also participating. The British government is very concerned about this matter, and the House is aware of it. They have already brought it to the attention of the Chinese and Japanese governments, and effective actions must be taken urgently to stop it. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Clive, who is handling this matter, is currently in close contact with the governments of other relevant countries. It is reported that the US Ambassador to Japan has also questioned the Japanese government. The British government will continue to closely monitor the development of this issue and give special consideration to the points raised by the members of Parliament. Foreign Secretary Eden also replied to a question from Conservative Party member Moore, stating that the "autonomous region" of eastern Hebei is in conflict with the Tanggu Truce. This is a matter between the Chinese and Japanese governments. As far as he knows, the Tanggu Truce places the responsibility for maintaining law and order in the demilitarized zone on the Chinese authorities. He has heard that difficulties have been encountered due to the division of effective authority, but he has not heard that the Japanese government does not recognize the Tanggu Truce as binding. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, eight members of the House of Commons will question the situation of smuggling in North China and the increase of Japanese troops, with a total of twelve questions raised. They are particularly concerned about the need for China Customs to add anti-smuggling teams, patrol boats, and patrol police, and will also inquire about who the smugglers are. It is reported that the London Chamber of Commerce is currently investigating the losses suffered by British businesses due to smuggling to negotiate with the Ministry of Commerce. If smuggling does not stop, China's tax revenue will inevitably suffer huge losses. Many believe that the Japanese government cannot sit idly by while smuggling is rampant. According to recent news from Tokyo, the attitude of the Japanese government has changed slightly. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The provincial government ordered the Public Security Bureau to crack down on Japanese rōnin renting houses in Guangzhou to prevent smuggling. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Haian came to the province from Zhongshan on the 25th and will hold another meeting with the Guangdong authorities on the 26th to revise the silver dollar system. Guangdong agreed that the right to issue banknotes should be handled by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The Central Bank will set up a branch in Guangdong to manage silver, and the head of the branch will be recommended by Guangdong. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tang Haian and Guangdong agreed to establish anti-smuggling sub-offices in Shantou, Humen, Jiangmen, Leizhou, and other places, and the Ministry of Finance will send anti-smuggling vessels to assist in anti-smuggling. This measure will be implemented next month. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) Smuggling in various parts of southern Fujian has become increasingly rampant recently. Unscrupulous merchants in Jinjiang are using Taiwanese citizens to organize smuggling companies. The authorities are currently investigating. It is reported that this smuggling company has expanded its scale and tightened its organization to seek huge profits. The Xiamen Customs Superintendent has ordered Jinjiang, Hui'an, and other counties, as well as the naval and police agencies, to cooperate in anti-smuggling. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Peiping) According to sources, the Japanese authorities are now planning to apply for or demand that the Chinese barracks in Nanyuan, outside the South Gate of Peiping, be handed over to the Japanese military for use. The barracks are currently garrisoned by Song Zheyuan's troops, and next to it are the airfields of China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation. For the past few months, Japanese military aircraft have been using this airfield at will, despite protests from central and local authorities, with no effect. It is believed that the Chinese authorities will comply with the Japanese authorities' request for two reasons: 1. To avoid the Japanese military forcibly occupying the barracks; 2. To prevent the Japanese military from being stationed inside the city. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Arab Anti-British Movement <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The Palestine Jewish-Arab ethnic dispute, which broke out on the nineteenth of last month, has become increasingly serious and has recently expanded into an anti-British movement. Jerusalem started a civil non-cooperation movement on the 15th, refusing to pay all taxes to support the strike. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 23rd, large numbers of British troops have arrived in villages and towns in Palestine, and countless bombers are soaring in the air all day, creating a tense situation as if in wartime.</p>
<p>Palestine is a country on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It was originally under the rule of the Turkish Empire. After the First World War, it was occupied by Britain. The Treaty of Sevres by the Allied Powers in 1920 stipulated that Palestine would be under British mandate. Since then, Britain has established a High Commission there to handle administrative and legislative affairs. However, the Arabs, who account for 80 percent of the total population of Palestine, have always been dissatisfied with British rule and have often launched anti-British movements. In order to consolidate its rule here, Britain has adopted a divide-and-rule policy that alienates ethnic groups and vigorously supports the Zionist movement, transplanting as many Jews as possible to Palestine. Originally, Palestine was the homeland of the Jews, but because they have always been scattered around, the majority of residents there are still Arabs. In recent years, Jews scattered around the world have suffered oppression from many national governments, causing them to wander east and west and feel deeply pained. They wanted to rebuild their homeland, and thus the so-called "Zionist movement" emerged. The continuous transplantation of Jews to Palestine is naturally detrimental to the Arabs, so ethnic disputes often occur, allowing Britain to reap the benefits and consolidate its rule there.</p>
<p>Thus, the "Zionist movement" has become the main pillar of British rule in Palestine, which is naturally unacceptable to Arab nationalists. Therefore, the Arab-Jewish ethnic conflict can also be said to be an integral part of the Arab anti-British movement. In the past, the Palestinian Arab national liberation movement mainly aimed at opposing British rule and Jewish colonists. The "Wailing Wall" incident in 1929, the general strike in 1932, and the armed incidents in 1933 all showed the climax of this movement. However, due to the lack of power of the leaders, they all ended in failure.</p>
<p>Now, the anti-British movement of the Palestinian Arabs has risen again due to the Arab-Jewish dispute. The settlement proposals put forward by the British High Commissioner have been rejected by the Arabs. They do not accept the arbitration method of settling the dispute. According to an Eighteenth National Electric dispatch, an Arab leader warned the British authorities that "the Arabs will not back down" and said, "The Arabs feel that there is no difference between Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and the Jews' conquest of Palestine. The only difference is that Italy used its own strength completely, while the Jews used British bayonets." From this, we can see the determination of their anti-British attitude. According to a Havas dispatch on the 14th, the Arabs in Syria also rose up in response. Perhaps a tragic scene will soon unfold on the Near East Peninsula.</p>

<p>Eighty-two American professors co-sign a statement on monetary policy</p>
<p>(Washington) An Associated Press reporter spoke with financial experts today, who stated that the Sino-American silver purchase agreement, attached to China's financial plan, is very timely. The United States' monthly purchase of Chinese silver will provide China with a stable and reliable source of foreign exchange. China needs this agreement for the following reasons: 1. Since February of this year, China's foreign trade deficit has reduced the foreign exchange reserve fund. 2. Smuggling in North China has cost the country thirty percent of its normal customs revenue. 3. The unease caused by Japanese military actions. (National Telegram from the 24th)</p>
<p>(New York) Eighty-two professors from American universities, all members of the American Economic Association, today jointly issued a declaration criticizing the government's monetary policy and making the following recommendations: 1. The government should quickly abandon the purchase of silver. 2. Congress should repeal the powers previously granted to the President to rebuild the bimetallic system and subsidize silver mines. 3. The government should make every effort to use the silver currently held by the Treasury for beneficial purposes. The committee also stated that purchasing silver at an artificial price will not only fail to promote economic recovery but will also increase the government's debt and reduce the credit of the national currency. (National Telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Mr. Goldthwaite, the director of the statistics department of the Federal Reserve Board, predicted today that the international community will rebuild the gold standard, but the method will be slightly different. Furthermore, this is unlikely to happen until the trade positions of countries on the gold standard have been corrected, because the world does not have enough gold to allow any country to export it without restriction. This new gold standard will probably not allow hoarding or speculation but will use the price of the entire currency to prevent financial turmoil from breaking out. We must know that a standard lacking elasticity can no longer be tolerated today. (National Telegram from the 24th)</p>

<p>Two Arabs Dead and Four Wounded, One British Soldier Killed, Unconfirmed Situation Deteriorating Daily, British Authorities Face Difficulties</p>
<p>Jerusalem Palestinian Arabs are determined to implement the expulsion of Jews, and the overall situation is deteriorating. Although the government has adopted stringent plans to deal with it, it has not achieved any results. There have been multiple shootings yesterday, with many deaths and injuries, including one British soldier killed in Lurnielshan and another British soldier wounded in Turkaram. The Jewish News Agency reported that British soldiers were killed when Arab rioters tried to break into a prison. The troops rushed to the scene, and the rioters fled into the mountains, firing shots, inflicting fatal injuries on one soldier. According to an official report, Arabs and police exchanged gunfire last night in Nablus, 30 miles north of Jerusalem. The Arabs were sniping from behind obstacles and rooftops. The police initially retreated but restored order when reinforcements arrived. As a result, two Arabs were killed and four were injured. At the same time, armed Arabs formed teams and went to various places, destroying field crops, cutting telephone lines, throwing bombs, and shooting at police and troops, even attacking armed vehicles. The military police retaliated from time to time, but because the Arabs always carried away the dead and wounded, it was impossible to ascertain the actual number of casualties.

<p>(Paris) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with a reporter from the French newspaper Le Figaro today and spoke with him. The reporter asked if Italy would be willing to provide solemn guarantees that it would not infringe on British East African territory or Egypt as an exchange condition for Britain's de facto, but not de jure, recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. Mr. Mussolini replied that he did not ask anything of Britain and that he was prepared to give Britain all possible guarantees. There will definitely not be a war in Europe, and he will continue to work to maintain peace, but first, the interests of all nations must be balanced and allowed to evolve before there can be peace. Italy is willing to remain in the League of Nations, but its cooperation must not be made impossible. The time has now come to break away from the psychological shadow and recognize the facts that can help promote the development of European culture. Mr. Mussolini then described in detail the process by which the Italian army, based on the air force, occupied Abyssinia, and said that the issue of using foreign capital to help develop Abyssinia has not yet arisen today.

<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia is about to come to England. It is rumored that this trip is to seek British aid in order to restore the imperial throne and to request the maintenance or tightening of sanctions against Italy. Officials said that British authorities do not want to engage in diplomatic talks with the Abyssinian Emperor but can allow him to attend public gatherings, give speeches, or publish articles in newspapers. Upon arrival, the British government does not intend to formally receive him. The Foreign Office will send someone to welcome him to show respect. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>Djibouti Mr. Bonner, a member of the British Red Cross, was detained by the Italian authorities on May 18. He was not released until yesterday and arrived here this morning, looking haggard. It is said that the Italians wanted him to confess that he was Rudolf Brunner, an Austrian general serving in the Abyssinian army. He was imprisoned in a cave where garbage was burned, with no food or drink for three days. Fearing that he would be killed, he fled into the desert, starving and thirsting, and nearly died. However, he was recaptured and sent back to the cave. Fortunately, he was released after the British Consul intervened. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>Cape Town, South Africa It has been learned today that the local authorities have a large-scale plan to turn this port into an important naval base. This plan is a direct result of Italy's occupation of Abyssinia. In the future, this port may become the main gateway for Far East trade. Officials said that after Italy controlled the Mediterranean, the United Kingdom's access to the East was in danger of being cut off, so a second line connecting to the Far East was necessary from a military point of view. Mr. Pirow, the South African Minister of Defence, will soon travel to London to discuss defence plans. It has also been learned today that heavy artillery, worth 500,000 US dollars, has been installed on Robben Island. The British government will also share the cost of widening and deepening the military port here. (National Telegram from the 24th)</p>

<p>(London) Political circles expect that Gore (Conservative), who has twice served as Colonial Secretary, will succeed Thomas as Colonial Secretary. Gore is currently the Minister of Public Works, and his vacancy will be filled by Education Secretary Wall (Labour) to maintain the position of the pro-government Labour Party within the government. Naval Minister Monsell will soon retire, and Prime Minister Baldwin is busy arranging the coronation of the King. Therefore, government commentators increasingly believe that this is the time to comprehensively reorganize the cabinet and, because the country is currently facing serious issues that need to be addressed, advocate recruiting new talent and increasing its dynamism. The Times newspaper's editorial today emphatically stated that Baldwin would naturally wish to loyally serve the new monarch and contribute his political experience during the initial difficult months of his reign. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) A cabinet reshuffle is likely to happen. Various government-aligned newspapers, as well as the Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, believe that even if the cabinet is reshuffled, there will be no major changes. However, the Conservative Morning Post and the Liberal News Chronicle believe that Colonial Secretary Thomas's resignation is a good opportunity for a purely Conservative cabinet to take the stage. The two newspapers attach great importance to the banquet held last night by Conservative Member of Parliament Lord Winterton (former Secretary of State for India) at his villa in Surrey, as the attendees were all important Conservative figures who had recently spoken in the House of Commons criticizing Baldwin's cabinet, such as former Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, former Naval Minister Winston Churchill, former Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, Sir Norman Angell, former chairman of the organizations linked to the League of Nations, and the Earl of Crawford, among others (Angell and Crawford are both extreme Conservative MPs). Among them, the News Chronicle stated, "As far as we know, these anti-Baldwin elements within the Conservative Party have recently discussed the matter of urging Baldwin to step down as soon as possible." The Morning Post stated, "The current cabinet is struggling to cope with major domestic and foreign issues, and most people think so. In the current situation, we cannot tolerate an insensitive government that simply occupies positions without doing anything, and all cabinet seats should be filled by capable individuals. Some say that the cabinet reshuffle should wait until after King Edward VIII's coronation (next March), but the situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. The current opportunity is fleeting and must be seized immediately." (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

The newspapers of each party, "Le Populaire" and "L'Humanité," reported on the event in great detail, saying that there were as many as 500,000 participants and that the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The right-wing "Le Figaro" reported, "After the parties of the Popular Front gathered on the streets in February of this year to commemorate the February 6, 1934, Paris riots, they have now decided to hold two more demonstrations on June 14 and July 14 to celebrate their election victory.

Mayor Herriot of this city, former leader of the Radical Socialist Party, delivered a speech, stating, "When we cheer for peace, we are cheering for France, because France and peace are two in one." President Bigeault of the Federation then spoke, saying that although the Federation is not a political party, it has high hopes for the future policies of the new majority party in the Chamber of Deputies (referring to the Popular Front). "The government, where the power of the state lies, must do its best to punish those who incite trouble, incite civil war, and promote social class struggle, without the slightest leniency. The people of the whole country who love the republican system will be the government's support. This Federation now hopes that republicanism will triumph, so that it can cleanse the country of those who dream of fascism or national socialism. France deeply hates and abhors these two doctrines and, no matter what, does not want to see them gain power." Finally, Bigeault advocated reforming the organization of the Banque de France and adopting a new economic policy. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today is the anniversary of the 1871 Paris Commune uprising.

The wall was covered with red cloth, and the tomb of the revolutionary writer Vallès, which is located near the wall, was also covered with red flowers, a sea of red. The parade was led by the sole surviving member of the Commune, carrying a flag, followed by the leaders of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, members of both parties, representatives of various labor unions, republican veteran organizations, and many intellectuals and laborers. The crowd cheered and paid their respects to the Socialist leader, the future Prime Minister Léon Blum. The parade ended at 9:00 PM, and the participants gradually dispersed to the strains of the "Internationale" (the Communist Party anthem). The event was relatively peaceful, and no incidents occurred, except that a faction of the Communist Party (i.e., those who advocate international intervention in French domestic affairs), anarchists carrying black flags, and followers of Trotsky (leader of the anti-cadre faction of the Soviet Communist Party) and the Fourth International were insulted and reviled by the crowds of the leftist Popular Front at the entrance to the cemetery and prevented from entering, causing a slight disturbance, but it was quickly quelled.

<p>(Brussels) The Belgian general election was held yesterday, and a newly formed political party achieved an unexpected victory. This party is composed of extreme Catholics who aim to clarify public politics. According to the initial reports of the election results, the party has already won 15 seats, and when the election is completed and announced, the number of seats of the party will not be limited to this. The Communist Party also gained new seats, and the Socialist Party lost some, but the Catholic Party lost a lot. The final results will not be released until a few days later. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Brussels) The results of the Chamber of Representatives re-election show that the fascist Rexist Party has won as many as 21 seats. The party's young leader, Léon Degrelle, recently told a reporter from "Le Soir" that "The victory won by this party is the death knell for the dictatorship of all parties. The people can henceforth restore the freedom of decision and action. This party will still strictly abide by the constitution, without overstepping it, which is completely different from the militarized oligarchy of a certain country.

On the contrary, the Catholic Party, the Liberal Party, and the position of this party have all declined compared to before. Among them, the Catholic Party's failure is similar to the Battle of Waterloo, and it is undeniable that this party has also lost many votes. However, this party will still occupy the most seats in the future Chamber of Representatives. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Brussels) After the initial results of the Chamber of Representatives re-election were announced last night, Socialist leader and former cabinet member, Emile Vandervelde, delivered a speech at the Labor Club, stating that "The votes obtained by this party have indeed decreased slightly compared to before, but it is fortunate that those who obtained these votes were the Communist Party and not the bourgeois political parties. As for the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party, they have suffered a major defeat, and the seats they have lost have been obtained by the fascist-leaning Rexist Party. It is obvious that these people will try their best to sabotage the representative system so that it cannot be operated as usual. This is something that we must strive to resist and not retreat in the slightest." (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>Financial Problems in Times of Emergency (Part 2) - Ma Yinchu</p>
<p>The Way Out for China's Finances</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the current financial situation in China, proactive foreign warfare is absolutely impossible. However, when passive attacks continue unabated, our country cannot always endure and retreat. As the saying goes, we will never abandon peace until hope is exhausted, and we will not lightly speak of sacrifice unless it is absolutely necessary. There is a limit to this. If peace must be abandoned and sacrifice must be magnificent, it is certainly not a sacrifice with bare hands. We must choose a relatively reasonable financial policy from the impossible. In my opinion, in an emergency environment, it can be divided into two methods: most urgent and absolutely urgent. In the most urgent situation, the tax system cannot be improved, and only the confiscation of people's wealth is possible. Although it is not necessary to force everyone to destroy their families to relieve the country's difficulties, they must be made to donate according to their ability. This is also a last resort. The absolutely urgent method should imitate the British method and implement income tax as the center of the tax system. This not only avoids the harm of damaging capital, but also has the benefit of raising tax rates at any time to increase revenue. I sincerely hope that the government can implement it immediately so that the people can develop a good habit of paying income tax. If the war does not break out immediately, then the habit of income tax has been cultivated, which is enough to cope with it. Even if it has not broken out, the confiscation system can still be adopted. Although it is not an ideal method, it is better than the indiscriminate issuance of paper money. Moreover, those who will take up arms to resist the enemy in the future will mostly be poor people. These people do not hesitate to bet their lives, and the sacrifice cannot be said to be insignificant. The rich people have been protected by the government and live in comfort, so it is their inescapable duty to sacrifice their property in times of war. Therefore, at this critical juncture of national crisis, everyone has capital, whether rich or poor, and must make sacrifices. The poor contribute their efforts, and the rich contribute their money. This does not violate the principle of equality. The only difference is that the poor sacrifice their lives, and their sacrifice must be real. Although there are those who die and those who do not, when they serve on the battlefield, they cannot know who will live and who will die. They all have the same spirit of sacrificing themselves for the country, so it can be said that the opportunity for sacrifice is equal, but the sacrifices are not equal. If income tax is levied progressively according to the size of the ability to bear, the equality of sacrifice has long been recognized by financial scholars and does not need to be said. Even donating money according to one's ability is not unequal. If we can act under these two major principles, we can fight the enemy. It only depends on how determined they are.</p>
<p>Comparing the entire economic organization of China and Japan, although Japan's material resources are stronger than China's, Japan is a newly emerging industrial country, and its wealth is concentrated in large cities such as Osaka, Yokohama, and Tokyo, which cannot cope with a long-term battle. China is mainly an agricultural economy, and its wealth is relatively dispersed, which has the ability to fight for a long time. Therefore, in my opinion, if the Chinese people are determined to resist with fear, the future is quite optimistic.</p>
<p>Clarifying Doubts</p>
<p>A few days ago, a newspaper reporter asked me about China's financial policy in times of emergency. Based on the results of the above opinions, I summarized three points to tell him:</p>
<p>Speedily open income tax as the center of wartime tax revenue; A limited expansion of currency can not only subsidize finances but also benefit foreign trade; Issue a small number of public bonds.</p>
<p>After this theory came out, there were many who expressed doubts, because income tax has not yet been implemented in our country. Even if the government immediately starts levying it, whether the tax revenue can be as expected by us is a big problem. Therefore, some advocate that we should reorganize finances to enrich the financial revenue in times of emergency, and others advocate that we should open land appreciation tax, increase entertainment tax, luxury tax, stamp tax, postage, and encourage certain donations to enrich the national treasury. For the above various methods of increasing the national treasury revenue in times of emergency, I can agree to all of them. However, the land appreciation tax revenue is limited, which was the case when Germany first opened it, and it belongs to local revenue. The income from land appreciation tax and stamp tax in Britain decreased during the war compared with before the war. Other taxes, such as entertainment tax, luxury tax, postage increase, and war profit tax, etc., although the number is limited, can also be a small supplement. As for the passive aspect of rationalizing finances (such as eliminating waste, reducing redundant institutions, eliminating corruption, etc.), it should have been done in peacetime and is not an emergency method in times of emergency. In addition, if there are other reasonable and legal revenues that are beneficial to the country, we also welcome all parties to express their great opinions in order to collect thoughts and benefit the public, and to achieve the effect of concerted efforts. As for the income tax, the tax revenue is not guaranteed at the beginning of the implementation. If the government can immediately open it and make the people develop a good habit of paying income tax, it is not a subsidy to increase income tax revenue in the future. Britain was able to rely on income tax as the main revenue during the European War, which was also due to the fact that the people already had a good habit of income tax. It was not achieved overnight. In my opinion, the main tax revenues from customs, salt, and unified tax in the national treasury in times of emergency will be short, but they will not be completely stopped. Other revenues will also not be without any money. If the limited currency inflation and the issuance of a small number of public bonds are not enough to make up for the emergency financial needs in times of emergency, it is best to borrow foreign debt from friendly countries without harming our sovereign principles in order to supply them. I think friendly countries may not refuse based on the harmony of the friendship between their countries and our country in peacetime. However, all friendly countries are based on the heavy losses of lending countries in the restoration period of borrowing countries and the economic panic in their own countries, so this move may not be hopeful. If it is impossible to do so, it is possible to negotiate with the creditor countries to postpone the repayment of old foreign debts, which is another way out for financial policy in times of emergency. If this move can be realized, it can reduce expenditure by at least 100 million yuan a year. (End)</p>

As for people's livelihood, they were even more ignorant, because the importance of people's livelihood was not yet felt in the environment at that time. It is not until now that rural areas are increasingly bankrupt and the economy is becoming more panicked, so people feel the importance of people's livelihood and the necessity of implementing it. This shows how far-sighted Dr. Sun was. Speaking of people's livelihood, there are many plans. If you want to implement it, it is very simple. Just follow the ancient saying "People's livelihood lies in diligence." Therefore, the word "diligence" is the true spirit of people's livelihood. Whether they are officials, students, farmers, or workers, if they can all be diligent, then everything will improve in an incredible way. This is the spirit of implementing people's livelihood and the foundation for the revitalization of the nation. After Mr. Ding finished his speech, the ceremony concluded, and the meeting adjourned.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a commemorative week at 10:00 AM on the 25th. Attendees included Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan, Niu Yongjian, Cheng Qian, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Zhou Yichun, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 500 staff members from the National Government and various ministries and departments. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and delivered a report on "Preparing for Constitutional Governance." He concluded his speech at 10:30 AM, and the ceremony adjourned. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the National Government's commemorative week on the 25th, Chairman Lin reported on preparations for implementing constitutional governance. He first stated that the draft constitution of the Republic of China, the Organic Law of the National Assembly, and the Election Law for Representatives have been promulgated by the National Government. According to the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, the election of representatives to the National Assembly should be completed before October 10th, and the National Assembly should be convened on November 12th to promulgate the constitution and implement constitutional governance. This is a major task in nation-building. He stated in his New Year's Day address this year, hoping that government colleagues and the people of the whole country would make special efforts this year, with one heart and one mind, to realize this fundamental work of national construction. Now that half of the time has passed, the draft constitution and the related laws of the National Assembly have been completed on schedule through the efforts of the Legislative Yuan. It can be said that our expected work has been partially completed. However, how to prepare for the implementation of the draft constitution will be a more arduous task. For a law cannot enforce itself. Having a constitution also requires the people to be able to use the constitution, abide by the constitution, and have the organization and strength to uphold the constitution, in order to produce the effect of implementing the constitution. He resolutely stated that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's entire legacy is the innate constitution. The current constitution is merely incorporating Dr. Sun's legacy into a written constitutional code. The Kuomintang's implementation of political tutelage is a preparation for implementing constitutional governance, and implementing the constitution is the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy. Since the start of political tutelage in the seventeenth year, the framework of the five-power government has been established, and the people have been gradually trained to exercise direct democratic rights and the ability to participate in politics, in order to ensure that the five-power constitution can achieve the expected results in practical application. At the same time, concrete construction of the principle of people's livelihood has also been actively carried out separately. Although it has not been fully effective in recent years due to military and other disasters, the central government is now enriched, and local administrative agencies are also becoming more and more sound. Education is gradually being promoted, and all other politics are gradually on track. Therefore, the central government has decided to implement constitutional governance this year. Finally, he said that after the promulgation of the draft constitution, the most important task at present is to actively complete the training of the people. He hopes that the government and the people will cooperate more diligently to tighten people's organizations before we can talk about the exercise of civil rights. Only when the people are organized and trained can they exert the strength of the group and develop habits of abiding by laws and order. Only such people can become the people of a rule-of-law country, and only such a country can become a rule-of-law country. Only then can the application of the constitution achieve satisfactory results. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles report that because cash is concentrated in cities and has limited outlets, there is a proposal to organize a joint rural investment organization. The plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance believes that the banks' shift of funds to rural areas aligns with the ministry's aim to relieve agriculture and is very willing to support it. The banks are currently planning a capital of five million yuan, which will establish a general office in Zhenjiang to fully inject and operate in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province, providing land mortgage loans and various rural loans, or promoting sales cooperation. It is hoped that it will be realized after Mr. Chen Guangfu returns to China. In addition, the Agricultural Bank of China's rural investment has previously focused on Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces. Investment in other provinces is extremely limited. The Ministry of Finance has ordered it to expand the scope of rural investment and land mortgage loans in its inland branches. The bank complied and submitted a plan for shareholder approval and has already begun preparations. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Xiangtan County Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to revise the Criminal Law, arguing that the penalties for counterfeit currency offenders were too light. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to review the matter. The Ministry of Finance believes that the penalties stipulated in the Criminal Law for punishing counterfeit currency offenses do not seem to be too light. The key is that governments at all levels should conduct strict inspections, and judicial authorities should enforce the law seriously, which is sufficient to prevent counterfeiting. Moreover, the Criminal Law has just been amended, promulgated, and implemented, and it is not appropriate to discuss further revisions hastily. It is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>— Special Correspondence from Beiping</p>
<p>The Situation is Tense</p>
<p>The Japanese side has long been making noises about increasing troops in Hebei. This materialized in the middle of this month. At noon on the 16th, Kawahara Shozo, the brigade commander of the 5th Division, also arrived in Peiping. The brigade headquarters was established on the same day at the site of the former Austrian Embassy in Dongjiaominxiang. Troops have also been arriving one after another. It is said that it will be completed by the end of June. In the future, the dignified old capital will probably become a Japanese military base in reality. The Japanese side refuses to announce the number of troops being increased, only saying that the rumors of the 3rd Division and the 5th Division are all false. However, according to reliable sources from various parties, Peiping will be increased to about 1,000 people, Fengtai (a large station between Peiping and Tianjin) to 300 people, Tianjin to 12,000 people, and Tongxian to 1,000 people.</p>
<p>According to general observation, the Japanese side's decision to increase troops is not only a show of force for diplomatic pressure against China, but also has great significance for the international community. In Inner Mongolia, there have been repeated rumors of independence recently. Japanese newspapers here have also widely rumored that Britain and Russia have reached various secret understandings on the Far East at the beginning of this year. Soviet Russia has recently openly declared that it can gain an advantage over Japan in terms of arms competition. Moreover, the 1st Division, which is known for its bravery and good fighting, has been deployed on the Russian-"Manchurian" border. These phenomena have revealed the terrifying scene of the eve of a storm, arousing infinite concern in the international community. On the 17th, the consuls of various countries stationed in Tianjin held a secret joint meeting to telegraph their respective governments to report the situation. However, on the 15th, the Japanese Ministry of the Army also announced that this decision to increase troops in North China was to defend against communist troops who advocate anti-Japanese sentiment, and would not harm the vested interests of other countries. In fact, the meaning of this is easy to see at a glance. However, we who live in Peiping cannot help but feel that we are fish on a chopping board, at the mercy of others, when we witness the future fate of this old capital.</p>
<p>A Calm Situation</p>
<p>Although the future fate of Peiping is in turmoil, the authorities are still very calm. Therefore, all facilities are also very active. Just in this week alone, the Transportation Committee and the Legislative Committee have been established for office. The Health Exhibition has also opened. The official-businessmen cordial meeting has been held. A small-scale civic park has also been completed. The welfare association for rickshaw pullers is currently in progress. These, on the surface, still give the residents a normal phenomenon. Regarding gambling dens and white powder houses that disturb local order, the Public Security Bureau has been preventing them except for those that cause major hindrance. Therefore, fortunately, the market is very stable.</p>
<p>Idle Citizens</p>
<p>The current situation is certainly much more serious than in the spring of the 22nd year. However, not only are there no crowds of people at the station waiting to escape like that year, but some tourists from other ports are flocking here. For example, the Shanghai Yousheng Travel Group and Ms. Huang Liushuang, the Chinese-American Hollywood star, have come to Peiping one after another, which shows this. Moreover, the Beining Railway Bureau, for the convenience of passengers, has also opened a special train from Tianjin to Peiping to see peonies.</p>
<p>This is the best time in Peiping. The climate is often around 70 degrees, and single-layer and double-layer clothing are both suitable. Try climbing Jingshan or the White Pagoda in Beihai for a view, and what you see is nothing but verdant green. The entire Peiping is completely hidden in a sea of leaves, or in the emerald green bushes, there are yellow tiles and red walls, exposed in the bright sunlight. Therefore, when the French novelist De Copela visited Peiping the year before, he expressed his impression, "Beautiful Peiping." Lilac flowers have just finished blooming, leaving residual flowers on the branches. Peony flowers are in full bloom, with many varieties, which cannot be found elsewhere. Peony flowers are budding and about to bloom, delicate and compelling. The peony flowers at Chongxiao Temple outside Xuanwumen and Zhongshan Park in the city this year are not as lush as in previous years due to the climate. However, according to the managers there, the number of visitors this year is even greater than in the peaceful era of the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China. From 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM, without interruption, all you can see is a bustling crowd of people, rubbing shoulders and bumping elbows, all coming to see the flowers.</p>
<p>Theaters, parks, cinemas, and other entertainment venues also seem to have more customers than before. Recently, such dramas as "Lianhuan Tao" and "Jiu Fa Zhongyuan", co-starred by Yang Xiaolou and Hao Shuchen at Qingle Theater, "Modern Times" showing at Guanglu Cinema, and "Desire" showing at Ping'an Cinema, are all full houses, unusually lively. Zhongshan Park and Beihai Park are even more crowded with tourists like ants. Recently, Zhongshan Park sold more than 10,000 tickets in one day. Dance halls were heavily closed during the era of Mayor Yuan Liang, with only the Beijing Hotel remaining. Recently, a new Golden Fan Dance Hall has opened on Public Security Street. Every evening, when the lights come on, the music never stops, and business is unusually prosperous. It is said that the boss is Japanese. Although business has not improved in the brothels in the Badahutong area outside Qianmen, those who buy laughter still come and go one after another, still showing an image of peace. Who knows that they are living in a serious and tense area?</p>
<p>On the 15th, the 13th Yellow Disaster Lottery was drawn in front of the Altar of Land and Grain in Zhongshan Park, and more than 10,000 people gathered to watch. The atmosphere was very tense for a while. It is said that 80% of the tickets sold in Peiping were from this lottery. Perhaps people become more speculative when they are more impoverished. On the 16th, when the International Dog Show was held at the French Barracks parade ground, hundreds of Chinese and foreign women also came to participate. Moreover, on the afternoon of the 17th, Li Liuxi and others of the Zunjing Society held the second lecture on the classics at North China University. It looks like everyone is very leisurely. Is this phenomenon everyone living in a drunken dream, or are they indulging in pleasure? I can't help but feel deeply emotional about it. (May 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Tang Hai'an Arrives in Guangdong to Negotiate the Change to the Silver Dollar System; Implementation Still Awaits Careful Consideration; Guangdong Authorities Agree in Principle <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Tang Hai'an, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, recently received orders from the Ministry of Finance to go south to consult with the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities on the unification of the currency system and the issue of anti-smuggling in the south. He arrived in Guangdong on the 18th and immediately went to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall to pay respects to the late Mr. Hu Hanmin. At 2:00 PM, he separately visited Chen Jitang, Lin Yun'gai, Qu Fangpu, Shen Zaihe, Bai Chongxi, and others to discuss Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's opinions on reforming the currency system in Guangdong and Guangxi (namely, changing both provinces to the silver dollar as the standard).</p>
<p>The Guangdong authorities, considering this a significant matter, convened a meeting of the heads of various financial institutions and economic experts at the Finance Department at 2:00 PM on the 18th. Participants included Chen Jitang, Lin Yun'gai, Qu Fangpu, Shen Zaihe, the President of the Provincial Bank, Chen Zhongbi, the President of the Municipal Bank, Chen Yuan'ying, the General Manager of the Provincial Property Management Office, and six or seven members of the Finance Department. During the meeting, Kong Minister's opinions on reforming the Guangdong currency system were discussed in detail. Everyone expressed agreement in principle, but the implementation method still requires detailed research. This is because Guangdong has long used the small dollar (i.e., Guangdong mill currency notes) as the standard. Public and private mortgages and debts are all in Guangdong currency. If the silver dollar is used instead, there will inevitably be many disputes. If the silver dollar is used in the future, how will the legal tender currently circulating in Guangdong be recovered, and how should the procedures for issuing silver dollar notes be handled? This matter has a great impact on the province's finances and must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of anti-smuggling in the south, Guangdong can follow the methods prescribed by the Ministry of Finance as much as possible. The meeting adjourned at about 4:00 PM. Furthermore, considering that the reform of the Guangdong currency system must take into account customs and environment, another meeting of the Economic Design Committee of the Finance Department was held on the 19th to study the advantages and disadvantages of implementing the silver dollar system in Guangdong. There were discussions on stabilizing foreign exchange, determining price indices, and protecting the silver already received.</p>
<p>According to an economic expert, Guangdong is studying everything about the issue of changing to the silver dollar system, with the following points:</p>
<p>*   After the silver dollar is used, should the silver dollar notes be allocated by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, or should they be printed by the Guangdong Provincial Bank itself?</p>
<p>*   In the future, should administrative expenses and military expenses be changed to be paid in silver dollars? If they are changed to be paid in silver dollars, how will the expenditure budget be financed?</p>
<p>*   In the commercial market and among the people, mortgages and bank deposits have traditionally been based on the small dollar. After changing to the silver dollar, how will transactions be made?</p>
<p>*   The Guangdong Provincial Bank has received tens of millions of dollars in silver from legal tender. After changing to the silver dollar, should the silver be kept in Guangdong or stored in the Ministry?</p>
<p>Proper methods must be devised from the above important points and submitted to the highest military and civilian authorities here for approval before further consultation with Tang Hai'an, so that it can be reported back to the Ministry of Finance. Tang, seeing that this case could not be resolved immediately, took advantage of this spare time to visit two sugar factories in Xinzao Township and Shitou Township on the 19th. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, he took the route through Hong Kong and returned to his ancestral home in Zhongshan County to attend to private affairs.</p>
<p>According to Tang, "This time, I was ordered to go south, and my task was to consult on the reform of the Guangdong currency system and to discuss strengthening anti-smuggling work. After several days of consultations with Commander-in-Chief Chen and Chairman Lin, Chen and Lin have generally expressed their agreement on the currency system reform. As for how to implement it, it needs to be carefully discussed before a decision can be made. It is planned to convene various experts in the short term to discuss it. At that time, Minister Kong will send people to Guangdong again to assist. Once a method is agreed upon, it can be implemented. After arriving in Guangdong, I visited Fan Zhanpeng, the Deputy Director of the Anti-Smuggling Office, to discuss strengthening anti-smuggling work. Currently, anti-smuggling in Guangdong is quite strict, and the smuggling trend in Shantou has also been slightly curbed. I will go north after all matters have been discussed. I will stay in Guangdong for about a month." (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Economic Center of Taiwan Shifts from Keelung to Kaohsiung; Kaohsiung is Located in the Southernmost Part of Taiwan, Proving that the Southern Advance is Extremely Active <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Japan is actively advancing south, using Taiwan as its base, and plans to move Taiwan's economic center from Keelung in the northernmost part to Kaohsiung (the reporter notes that Kaohsiung was formerly known as Takao). Kaohsiung is located in the southernmost part of Taiwan, close to the Philippines and the Caroline Islands, a Japanese mandate in the South Seas. Moreover, Kaohsiung's trade has already exceeded Keelung's. According to statistics from the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, in the four months from January to April of this year, the total value of exports to foreign countries was 8,305,303 yuan, of which Keelung accounted for more than 5,460,000 yuan and Kaohsiung accounted for more than 2,460,000 yuan. The total value of imports was 19,260,504 yuan, of which Keelung accounted for more than 9,420,000 yuan and Kaohsiung accounted for 8,610,000 yuan. The total value of exports to the mainland (referring to Japan proper) was 174,077,201 yuan, of which Keelung accounted for more than 45,130,000 yuan and Kaohsiung accounted for 124,030,000 yuan. The total value of imports was 73,300,709 yuan, of which Keelung accounted for more than 46,880,000 yuan and Kaohsiung accounted for 19,760,000 yuan. The total value of foreign exports and imports and domestic exports and imports was 27,394,717 yuan, of which Keelung accounted for 106,905,441 yuan and Kaohsiung accounted for 154,882,409 yuan. That is, Kaohsiung increased by 47,976,965 yuan compared to Keelung. In fact, the economic center has shifted from Keelung to Kaohsiung. Moreover, Taiwan's foreign exports and imports and domestic imports are all less in Kaohsiung than in Keelung, but exports to Japan proper are more than 78,898,068 yuan more than Keelung, a ratio of about 1 to 270. Most of Taiwan's raw material production is concentrated in Kaohsiung and then imported into Japan proper, which has exhausted the economic chain relationship between the colony and the home country.

<h3 id="e63">Japanese Planting Apple Trees in the Northeast Fails; Cold Climate Affects Harvest; Cherries and Pears Are Also Almost Completely Destroyed <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: The Japanese believe that apples are a very common food among fruits, and those who run apple orchards make great profits. Therefore, the Japanese have vigorously promoted the planting of apple trees in the Northeast. However, last winter, due to the extremely cold weather, apple trees in various places were mostly damaged by frost. Therefore, the flowering situation this spring is not good. Although it is mediocre in the Guandong Leased Territory, the damage is very severe in the north, such as near Xiongyue. It is said that Red Fuji (apple name) is only about 20-30% of the previous year, and pears have not flowered and are almost completely destroyed. Although Zhuchu (apple name) in the Guandong Leased Territory is still the same as in previous years, Red Fuji is only half of the previous year. Overall, it seems difficult to avoid a reduction of 30-40% compared to previous years. Furthermore, cherries, which are a special product in the Guandong Leased Territory, also have a very bad phenomenon and are already almost completely destroyed. Although it is currently the flowering season, it is impossible to know the exact details. Judging from the cold this spring, the resulting harvest will definitely be reduced. Therefore, the Japanese, who are running the orchard business with national funds, are all looking worried because they had a poor harvest last year due to rain and are now harmed by the cold. And the general public, hearing that they will lose affordable apples, also feel unhappy.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Gansu Provincial Government Strictly Rectifies Official Norms; Orders County Magistrates to be Prohibited from Leaving Their Posts Without Permission; Public Servants Sign Pledges Not to Use Drugs <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Chairman Yu of the Provincial Government believes that county magistrates have the responsibility to defend their territory and are of great importance to the local area. Leaving their posts without permission has long been strictly prohibited. Recently, it has been found that some county magistrates still leave their posts without permission without prior approval, which is a serious violation of law and discipline. Yesterday, he specifically telegraphed all county magistrates, ordering them not to leave their posts without permission in the future unless they have obtained prior approval. If the above situation occurs again, they will be severely punished to emphasize their duties. Moreover, considering that public servants at all levels are a model for the people, and that the use of opium and other drugs has long been prohibited by law, and now that the province is vigorously implementing the prohibition of drugs, it is feared that there are still secret users. It is urgent to report them. He specially ordered all internal and external institutions to take a pledge from those within their respective institutions who do not use opium and drugs to prove it for compilation. If it is known that there are people who have a history of addiction and have just quit, they should be secretly marked in the form for verification.</p>
<p>The disaster situation in western Gansu Province is quite serious, especially in the eight counties of Yongchang, Shandan, Minle, Linze, Jinta, Jiuquan, Anxi, and Yumen. However, according to the regulations of the Opium Prohibition Bureau, these eight counties should pay a total of 200,560 yuan in opium land fines from April to July. Now that the system of allocating funds to the west has been abolished, and the New Second Army and the Second Cavalry Division need about 100,000 yuan per month, if all taxes are deferred, the provincial treasury will feel a lack of funds. Chairman Yu, in order to take both into account, proposed the 406th Provincial Affairs Conference to make a resolution to defer the opium land fines of Anxi and Yumen counties until August 1. Shandan, Minle, Jiuquan, Jinta, Linze, and Yongchang counties will collect half of the taxes now, and the other half will be deferred until August 1.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei (Special Correspondent Cheng Jun) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(14) Guanghua and Hekou (Part 1)</p>
<p>Guanghua is a small county in northern Hubei, where the people are poor and the land is barren. The old Hekou, which it governs, is the most famous market town. The city and town are only a few miles apart. The reporter visited and inspected them separately. What I saw and heard was nothing more than the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of commerce. The suffering of the people is probably a hundred times greater than the difficulties of the merchants. Therefore, I will describe them separately as follows:</p>
<p>Guanghua was the ancient Yin State, and later Zuoyang was established here. Xiao He's fief was here. The county territory is more than 100 li wide from east to west and more than 90 li long from north to south. The mountains and ridges are overlapping in the northwest, and the terrain is flat in the southeast. It borders Xiangyang, Junxian, Bancheng, and Dengxian and Neixiang in Henan. The Han River enters the territory from Junxian, winding and turning, passing through Laohekou and going east. There are about 400,000 mu of cultivated land in the county, and 90% of them are dry land. Self-cultivating farmers account for 50%. The products are cotton, sorghum, wheat, peas, etc. Rent and grain are paid twice a year without any additional charges. 70-80% of the soil is "sandy soil," and 10-20% is clay. The so-called "sandy soil" is like a measure but not sand and has very little stickiness. It is easy to dissolve. Even in the most abundant year, its harvest can only be one-tenth of that of clay. As for the remaining 10%, farmers work hard all year round. Even if they get enough to eat, the Henan bandits have repeatedly started trouble, and floods and droughts occur frequently. The rural economy has fallen into an extremely destructive situation. Farmers in the northeastern townships consider farming to be the most barren of the barren. They are so poor that they do not know the taste of salt all year round. Rice and wheat are also regarded as pearls. Corn and wheat bran are the main foods. Their houses are built with corn stalks, the walls are smeared with mud, and covered with wheat straw. Some people do not know what lighting a lamp is all their lives. Recently, the price of rice and grain has soared, and the people's food has become panic. The wheat bran sold on the market is in short supply. When a shop opens, tens of thousands of people gather. They often wait for two hours before they can get it. The reporter met a peasant woman who could not buy bran and stood there weeping. According to her, "Poor people have no money to buy rice and wheat and can only eat bran. Now that the price of rice and wheat is soaring, the price of bran is also increasing. Eleven catties of bran cost 160 yuan. Because of the lack of wheat bran, the store limits each person to buy only one or two liters, which is not enough for a family of several people to eat, and they have to wait for a long time. It is almost noon now. I think my parents-in-law, children are looking forward to it." When asked about how to eat bran, she said, "Cook the bran with wild vegetables or corn into a thin porridge. The reason why we must have bran is that it still has wheat properties. Eating this thing easily causes abdominal pain, especially for the elderly parents-in-law. But what can we do? Therefore, every three or four days, we must buy a little bit of oil cake (cake made with oil) and mix it in to slightly lubricate the intestines."</p>
<p>Farmers are so poor, yet there are officials urging the rent, rushing to the door, as urgent as a fire. What they are urging is the field tax. The officials are dispatched by the Finance Department. Farmers have no way to cope and can only resort to "selling pre-goods." The so-called "selling pre-goods" means selling the wheat in the ground before it turns yellow to others. In the future, after harvesting, the price is reduced by half according to the market price of wheat. For example, if each dou of wheat is worth one string of money, it is only counted as 50 yuan. It is also called "selling green seedlings." The most miserable thing for peasant women is "selling milk." After giving birth, they suck out their milk and sell it to the rich in the market. The method of selling is calculated by month. At first, it can be sold for two yuan a month. Later, because there are more and more sellers, it is gradually reduced to two yuan or even one yuan. They personally deliver it to the door every day, even if the road is several miles away, and there is no gap for wind and rain. The money they get is either used to buy wheat bran or to pay taxes. It is often exhausted as soon as they get it. Farmers feel unhappy when they mention the field tax, and even get angry at the security team. The reason is that "The security team is raised by the people's hard-earned money. Their duty is to suppress bandits in this county. They should not be sent to other counties. Now, the security team has been stationed in eastern Hubei for a long time, ignoring the bandit problem in this county, and the money they need is still collected from this county. I really don't want to." Farmers have childish knowledge and do not know that the security team is being unified in the district and will eventually be unified in the province. They actually complain that they are being sent to support eastern Hubei. Although they have a narrow view, they are also urged to pay urgently, which is the reason for their anger. It is heard that when the team opened to support eastern Hubei, they planned to raise support fees. The countryside has become a withered tree and cannot be oiled. The shops in Hekou paid one year's donation in advance before they could open to support it.</p>
<p>The reporter visited the county magistrate of the county, Geng Xin, at the county government and asked about the matter of urging the collection of mu tax. According to him, "The county has a total of more than 440,000 mu of land. Because the land is barren and the people are poor, the tax and grain have never been collected in full even in years of great harvest. Now, after the disaster, the barren land has no harvest at all, and the fertile land has a harvest, but it is also robbed by the Henan bandits. As a result, more than 100,000 mu of land are barren. Currently, the people bear 6 cents of field tax per mu, plus 6 cents of county government education donation, 6 li of provincial dike construction donation, and 2 jiao of mu donation, for a total of 2 jiao 2 fen 6 li. Judging from the soil quality and output of this county, it is too heavy and cannot be afforded by the people. However, the team must also be paid, so it is difficult to have both. This time, urging the tax is nothing more than executing orders. It is not what I want to do, and it is not an exaggeration that the people's complaints are gathered in the county government. However, the field tax is determined to increase from 6 cents to 1 jiao in the future, and the burden will be heavier and the collection will be more difficult, which is a deep concern. I have always held the purpose of 'It is good to practice in the government.' Now, I am forcing the collection of mu tax in the time when the green and yellow are not connected. Half a lifetime of practice has been reduced for this one thing." In a few words, the general local officials' pain of wanting to love the people but being unable to do so is fully expressed.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: There are often leprosy patients in various parts of Guangdong Province who beg in groups or harass the local area, which has a great impact on local security. It is urgent to arrest and confine them to prevent the spread of the disease. It is found that although there are leprosy hospitals in Gaoming, Dongguan, Qiongshan, and Shantou cities and counties, and the Beihai Puren Hospital in Hepu County also has a leprosy hospital, they are all small and crowded. Those who come later often suffer from being unable to be accommodated. The Civil Affairs Department, seeing this, believes that the above leprosy hospitals really need to expand their housing and increase the number of places. It has now decided to allocate more than 150,000 yuan from the savings of the department's surveying team to the above five leprosy hospitals, with each hospital subsidized with 10,000 yuan for construction costs and 1,000 yuan for equipment, ordering the mayors and county magistrates to carefully plan to add houses to the leprosy hospitals to accommodate 100 lepers and purchase daily necessities to be enough for 100 lepers. After the construction is completed, it will be ordered to all counties that if leprosy patients are found, they should be immediately arrested and sent to the hospital. As for how much the monthly increase in regular expenses for each leprosarium should be, it is planned to order the mayors and county magistrates to prepare detailed budgets and submit them to the department for transfer to the provincial government for approval. The above-mentioned fund allocation and subsidy method has been submitted to the provincial government by the Civil Affairs Department yesterday, requesting approval so that it can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Huxiang Town, Yongchun County, Fujian Province, is Captured by Bandits; Zhang Chengfu's Bandit Troops Loot and Leave; Estimated Loss of the Entire Town Reaches 100,000 Yuan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Huxiang Town, 35 li east of Yongchun County, used to have Huxiang City, which was an important town between Yongchun, Dehua, Xianyou, and Nan'an counties. At about 6:00 AM on the 16th of this month, it was suddenly attacked by more than 200 bandits from Zhang Xiongnan's gang in Dehua, led by Zhang Chengfu and Zhang Kewu, carrying more than 100 long and short guns and more than a dozen hand-held machine guns, in three routes. Huang Guoqi, the head of the Third District, hastily led more than a dozen county security team members and strong men to resist, but because they were outnumbered, the town was captured after half an hour. Huang led the team to retreat to Xianxi Dage. More than 100 bandits, holding guns, first entered the town. The bandits who came later mostly held flat shoulders and ropes. All the large and small shops in the town, more than 500 in total, were looted, and even pigs were carried away. The total loss has not yet been counted in detail, but is estimated to be about 100,000 yuan. During the looting, the villagers who were killed included Huang Duijin, Huang Shili, Qiu Zhens, the ten-year-old grandson of Huang Jing, and the twenty-year-old daughter-in-law of Huang Jizhong. There were also one eight-year-old child and two unknown men, and district police Lin Jian, etc. At the same time, Penglai Township nearby was also captured, killing Huang Fanyi and nine others, and injuring more than 50 people. After Huang Guoqi, the head of the Third District, retreated to Xianxi Dage, he sent someone to report to the 26th Brigade of the 9th Division in Yongchun County. The division urgently sent a team to Huxiang at noon and telegraphed the nearby garrison to jointly encircle and suppress them. However, the bandits knew that Huxiang was very close to the county seat, and reinforcements could arrive in a few hours. Therefore, after entering the town to rob, they fled before noon. After the reinforcements recovered Huxiang and Penglai, they divided their forces to pursue and suppress them. It was found that the bandits Zhang Chengfu and Zhang Kewu from Zhang Xiongnan's gang in Dehua suddenly mutinied during the compilation and verification of troops this spring and entered the mountains of Dehua to become bandits. After the 26th Brigade searched and suppressed them and blockaded them, and the farmers in small townships were merged into large townships, Zhang's bandits lacked food, so they fled in separate ways. One part fled to Yongtai and joined forces with Qiu Chenghu, and another part stayed between Dehua and Xianyou. This time, the looting of Huxiang was done by the Dehua gang. (May 20)</p>
<h3 id="e68">A Large Amount of Gold from the Ming Dynasty is Discovered in Fuzhou; Worth More Than 500,000 Yuan; Gold Ingots are Engraved with Ancient Seal Script and the Character "Ming" <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Cai Yichi, a villager in Houxian Township outside the West Gate of Fuzhou, made a living by making tinware. His family only consisted of an old mother with white hair and his wife, Wu. In recent years, their livelihood has become increasingly exhausted. The three of them were suffering from not being able to make a living. In the spring of the previous year, they had another daughter. Therefore, seven things to be dealt with everyday, and the cost had become burdensome. Cai, who was superstitious, was extremely bored, so he went everywhere to pray to gods and worship Buddha, vainly hoping to make a fortune. A few days ago, Cai cut down a large tree on an acre of land inherited from his ancestors for firewood and built a temporary house to store his father's coffin. Later, his father's coffin was reburied in the cemetery, and the temporary house was also demolished. Recently, Cai, feeling that his livelihood had been cut off, coordinated with his wife, Wu, to reclaim the garden land in order to plant vegetables for a living. After days of hard work, the field of rubble was turned into a vegetable garden. However, because the roots of the old tree still occupied the garden, on the morning of the 22nd of this month, Wu took a hoe and dug up the roots to prepare for fuel. That day, Cai went out to work as a laborer, and only Wu was working in the garden. Unexpectedly, after digging about two feet, she found a stone bar lying under the tree. Wu was very surprised to see this, so she tried her best to dig down again. After another foot or so, she suddenly found a porcelain jar filled with gold, stacked on top of each other, dazzling and dazzling. Wu was so happy that she couldn't help but shout. For a while, neighbors gathered, and a few pieces were picked up. Wu asked everyone to help transport it to her home. It is said that 330 catties of gold were dug up that day, worth more than 500,000 yuan, including 38 catties of gold ingots and 300 catties of gold bricks. The gold ingots were engraved with the ancient seal script character "Ming," with a mottled antique color, which is expected to be from the Ming Dynasty. The poor family, the poor woman, suddenly became rich. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could not help but be ecstatic and dumbfounded. After a long time, they finally knew that they had made a fortune. However, they were afraid that her husband would use the money to gamble and squander it, and they were also afraid that the thieves would come to the broken house. Considering this and worrying about that, they felt at a loss and sent it to her parents' home, and exchanged more than one catty for more than 1,600 yuan in cash at a gold shop on South Street to purchase items. She secretly stored the gold bricks elsewhere. When Cai returned home, he heard rumors from the neighbors and urgently asked his wife again and again, and agreed with Cai that he must not waste it in the future. Cai heard this, nodded repeatedly, swore repeatedly, and knelt down and kowtowed to thank God for the gift, and asked to take out the gold ingots. Wu then told him that there were thirty-seven pieces of broken gold ingots, which are now stored in her parents' home. Cai went to his in-laws' home to ask for them. Unexpectedly, the mother-in-law suddenly saw the wealth and was reluctant to give it up and wanted to embezzle it, and only took a few catties of gold and returned it, and said that the rest were thrown away as soil. Cai knew that it was his mother-in-law's plan to lie, and a big dispute arose. Therefore, the mother-in-law and son-in-law became enemies. Cai believes that this large fortune was given to him by praying to Buddha for many years. His mother-in-law embezzled it out of thin air and enjoyed the benefits. He was very unwilling to do so, and will hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court to seek to return the pearl to Hepu. (May 23)</p>

<p>The Suzhou Cocoon Industry Association decided that due to the fact that the silkworm information in various villages has passed the dormancy period and they are going to cocoon, it is necessary to prepare for the opening of various cocoon markets. It has been decided that the cocoon markets in Guangfu Township will open on the 29th, the cocoon markets in Hengjing and other townships will open on the 21st, and the cocoon markets in East and West Dongting will open on June 1st. As for the cocoon price, it is set at 30 yuan for improved varieties and 21 yuan for ordinary native varieties. There are 34 cocoon markets in the urban and rural areas of Wu County. According to people in the cocoon industry, it is said that recently, when the silkworms are going to cocoon, they have suffered from the cold weather, and the silkworm bodies have been greatly affected, which has also greatly affected the cocoon bodies.</p>

<p>The business tax for the tung oil cake industry in Wu County used to be two per thousand, but it has been increased to five per thousand last year, which is considered unbearable. They have repeatedly appealed to all parties, but to no avail. Therefore, they submitted a request to the county chamber of commerce, which was forwarded to the provincial business federation, and then submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to strive for a reduction and restore the original two per thousand in order to maintain business. At the same time, they jointly appointed representatives from more than a dozen counties, including Suzhou, Wuxi, Liyang, and Changshu, to go to the province together to petition the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, requesting them to forward the request for verification, so as to relieve business difficulties. It is heard that the results of the petition are satisfactory, and the provincial authorities have agreed to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for review. The representatives have now returned separately. It is heard that if necessary, they will jointly appoint representatives from the province to petition the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<p>At about 4:00 PM on the 24th, a traveler came to the Railway Hotel on Railway Station Road. He was about 30 years old, wearing a gray cloth jacket, a black vest, and carrying a small bag. He opened room number 83 on the rear floor and wrote his name as Xi Kun, also known as Ding Xiangsheng, from Wujin. He immediately ordered the tea boy to go out and buy wine and dishes and drank alone in the room without saying a word, as if he had 10,000 things on his mind. The tea boy did not suspect anything. At about 9:00 PM, the tea boy took the rice inside and suddenly saw that the traveler had hanged himself on the bedpost. His face was pale, his eyes were protruding, and blood was flowing from his nostrils. He had already died. He reported to the accounting room. They entered the room to check and found a suicide note addressed to No. 8, Yubei Lane, Zhijie, Changzhou Prefecture. The content of the letter roughly stated that because of high debts, he could not repay them and had to take this drastic measure. Yesterday (the 25th), the hotel reported to the court and requested an autopsy. The court ordered a special foot to go to Changzhou to notify his family to come to Wuxi to arrange the funeral. After receiving the report, the prosecutor's office sent prosecutor Shen to conduct an autopsy with coroner Wang at 11:00 AM, confirming that he had died by hanging.</p>

<p>Director Long Tiyao of the Model Sericulture District in this county, with the approval of the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association for the number of cocoon drying stoves in the county, has announced that the registration for setting up 2,691 stoves will commence on the 22nd and close on the 27th of this month, once the quota is full. The registration method is as follows: Each stove (single stove) is calculated at 1,500 catties of dried cocoons, with a deposit of one yuan per 100 catties. Those who register but do not collect cocoons will have their deposit confiscated. Any cocoon businesses that have not registered and independently collect cocoons from customers, violating the unified control measures, will have all the dried cocoons collected confiscated. For this registration period, the deposit must first be submitted to the Cocoon Industry Association, which will then request registration from this district and issue a registration certificate. Cooperative cocoons dried by rural cooperatives in the four directions can be registered in the district from today, but a guarantee letter must be issued by the local township head or village chief, prohibiting private purchases and requiring joint sales, and improvement fees must be paid in accordance with regulations. Any violations will still be handled in accordance with item two of the revised regulations for collecting improvement fees.</p>

You participated in confidential matters, and commanded with certainty. You depended on each other in times of trouble, and remained unchanged until death. During your life, you upheld strictness and righteousness, and were firm and decisive, which came from your nature. You were respectful in dealing with the world and respectful to yourself. Your integrity was awe-inspiring, and became stronger and stronger. The European wind and Asian rain made the nation's steps difficult. It was you, Mr. Hu, who became the mainstay of the country.

The Founding Father said, 'Alas, the atmosphere of the enemy is still pressing, you are wise and scheming, sweep away the court cave.' The Founding Father said, 'Alas, the virtue of the enemy is still stinking, you use the pen and tongue, and sweep it away with thunder.' Secret plans and deep words, ten thousand ends and thousands of entrustments, accompanied each other in distress, and did not regret death for nine times.

The primary enemy stole the country, and you rose up to be righteous, success or failure, advantage or disadvantage, is not what you expected. The strong encourage the rebellious, and the feudal lords hold the army, you followed the Founding Father, and were not surprised by the national crisis.

<p>The Central Government hopes for sincere unity to continue Hu's legacy. The gravesite was inspected in Nanjing, but no decision has been made.</p>
<p>Li Xiangen, specially appointed by the Southwest Executive Department and the Political Affairs Committee to report on the death of Chairman Hu, recently went to Nanjing from Shanghai to visit Chairman Lin, President Jiang, and other central authorities, reporting on the details of Chairman Hu's death and inspecting the gravesite.

<h3 id="e80">China's Delegation to Siam Sets Off Today Aboard an Italian Ship <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Farewell Tea Party Hosted by Civic Organizations</p>
<p>Deputy Head of Delegation Lin Kang Gives Farewell Speech in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Republic of China's delegation to Siam, permitted to depart today aboard the Italian ship "Victoria," was honored with a farewell tea party yesterday at 4 PM, hosted by the First Special District Citizens' Federation and the General Labor Union. Deputy Head of Delegation Lin Kang gave a farewell speech in Shanghai. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Farewell Tea Party: The First Special District Citizens' Federation and the General Labor Union hosted a farewell tea party for the delegation to Siam yesterday at 4 PM at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club. In addition to the head and deputy head of the delegation, members, and secretaries, over eighty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Manyun, Yu Shenxian, Zhou Xiang, Liu Zhongying, Long Peiyun, Ye Xianggao, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Wang Jian'e, Zhu Yangwu, Zhou Bangjiao, Wan Futian, and Li Ruzhang. Wang Xiaolai, the chairman, delivered a farewell speech, followed by responses from the head and deputy head, Ling Bing and Lin Kang, who elaborated on the purpose of this trip to Siam. The gathering dispersed around 5 PM.</p>
<p>Departure Today: The delegation is scheduled to depart today at 12 noon aboard the Italian postal company's "Victoria" ship. The ship is docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. Those seeing them off must arrive at the pier before 12 noon. The delegation includes Head Ling Bing, Deputy Head Lin Kang, members Yu Ming, Liu Hou, Li Gan, Fang Zhizhen, Wang Zhixin, Cao Yumin, Chen Chongkan, Huang Tianjue, Yang Donglin, Ma Chaoyong, and secretaries Liu Yiling, Ye Xiangfa, and Xiong Meisun, a total of fifteen people. They will also carry domestically produced Hunan embroidery, Beijing satin, Fujian lacquerware, and other gifts for Siam.</p>
<p>Head of Delegation's Speech: Deputy Head Lin Kang delivered a farewell speech, stating, "Personally, I find participating in this delegation to Siam very interesting. Having worked in the business world for so long, I have rarely traveled abroad and my horizons are limited. This opportunity allows me to get a change of scenery. At my age, over sixty, it may also be a way to maintain health. Furthermore, broadening my horizons is a virtuous endeavor, so I gladly join. Befriending our neighbors is a traditional spirit of the Chinese people, and Siam is our close neighbor. In particular, our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam may gain a clearer understanding of the state of our country's economic construction and find solace, which will surely increase their spirit of promoting Sino-Siamese trade. The world has now become an economic world, so the purpose of my investigation is limited to economics, with other matters considered casually. The ancients said that courtesy demands reciprocity. In my view, this trip is also a matter of reciprocity."</p>
<h3 id="e81">Smuggling Impacts Shanghai Tobacco Factories, Entire City's Tobacco Industry Nears Collapse <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Voluntary Sanctions Show Slight Effect</p>
<p>Smuggling continues to spread recently. Among the 36 cigarette manufacturing factories of Chinese merchants in this city, the North China sales office has recently abandoned business in the Tianjin and Beijing areas due to double taxation, resulting in significantly quieter business compared to the same period last year. In recent days, various circles have loudly advocated for voluntary sanctions, which have shown a slight effect.</p>
<p>North China Business in Dire Straits: The cigarette factories manufacturing Chinese cigarettes have traditionally used Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Hankou as their main bases, with Shanghai accounting for the absolute majority. Nearly 36 factories have joined the association, and Shanghai is the distribution center. Since the constant influx of smuggled goods from North China, cigarettes have been a major part of it, making it impossible for legitimate cigarettes to be sold in the North China market. Therefore, more than 20 Shanghai cigarette factories with sales offices in North China have tacitly closed down.</p>
<p>Difficulty Selling Smuggled Goods in Shanghai</p>
<p>Not only that, but this kind of smuggled good is also prevalent in Shanghai. Six months ago, small cigarette paper stores, enticed by illicit profits, successively imported at low prices. Since the voluntary sanctions from all walks of life, it has been difficult to sell these cheap smuggled goods. It is now even more impossible to transport them, and they do not dare to openly sell them.</p>
<p>Decline in Business for Chinese-Owned Tobacco Factories</p>
<p>There are currently 26 Chinese-owned tobacco factories in the industry association. Thanks to the concerted efforts of workers, they are able to continue operating as usual, but production has decreased by more than a quarter compared to last year. Business is declining, and the trend is even more sluggish than last year. The lack of purchasing power in rural areas is the main reason.</p>

<p>Appraisal of Tea Shipped to Shanghai Completed Yesterday, Trading to Begin Today</p>
<p>Special Banquet Hosted for the Press Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, at 2 PM yesterday, held a gathering at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road for members of the local press, reporting on the establishment of the black tea transportation and sales association. Over forty reporters from various newspapers attended. Mr. Liu delivered a report, stating that foreign countries have never tried Chinese tea, so in the past, the number of Chinese tea exports was very small. Afterward, foreigners gradually became interested in Chinese tea, so there was a greater need recently, and the export numbers have also increased year by year. The best trade year was 1933, occupying the first position in exports. However, now it has declined, suddenly dropping to sixth place. In view of this, the government, to save the Anhui and Jiangxi black tea exports, cooperated between the Ministry of Industry, the National Economic Council, and the authorities of the two provinces, organized and established the Qimen Black Tea Production and Sales Association, and actively researched improvements, ordering new machinery from abroad, which has now arrived. In addition to researching improved manufacturing, to alleviate current difficulties, the National Economic Council convened a tea technology conference, passed principles, organized the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee, and established a general transportation and sales office in Shanghai. After the establishment of the Transportation and Sales Committee, it has achieved excellent results, such as cost reduction, packaging of tea boxes, improved transportation, facilitated inspection, and direct sales, all of which have had tremendous benefits. Since the Shanghai foreign tea firms opposed and implemented a halt to exchange, Anhui and Jiangxi have released over one million yuan in funds, including over one hundred thirty thousand yuan released by local banks, over thirty thousand yuan by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and over forty thousand yuan borrowed from the Bank of Communications. As for the black tea shipped to Shanghai, it has reached 11,500 boxes, and the quality assessment committee has assessed 105 types. After officially displaying samples the day before yesterday, foreign tea merchants convened colleagues today to conduct quality appraisal and pricing, and it is expected that trading will begin at 9 AM tomorrow morning. At 2:30 PM, the guests and host parted amicably. It was also learned that Mr. Liu boarded a night train to Anhui via Nanjing last night.</p>

<p>The ship has expanded the area of the original fourth-class cabin this time in dry dock, so that it can carry more passengers, but the bad habit of sitting and lying on the floor at will has been eliminated, and all are changed to seats. Those traveling in fourth class, like riding in third- or fourth-class trains, only have a seat and no bed.

It will be implemented from today.</p>
<p>Crew Change</p>

<h3 id="e90">Special District City Federation Issues Statement Regarding Telephone Explanations <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Last Winter's Telephone Directory Had 488 Pages</p>
<p>Spring Telephone Directory Reduced to 426 Pages</p>
<p>4,500 Households Have Been Disconnected</p>
<p>Shanghai Shishi News: The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's explanation that "recently, newspapers have carried news of various members or groups notifying their members to stop paying telephone bills in order to reduce the current telephone charges. Although some groups may have asked their members not to pay the telephone bills, the Shanghai Telephone Company knows that the groups and their leaders themselves are paying on time. Therefore, users who do not pay telephone bills are only sacrificing their own credit and being fooled by others," issued the following statement yesterday: "Regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's decision to collect new tariffs, this federation was the first to declare its opposition and has been working with various groups in the city to proceed together, and has not slackened to this day. All the circumstances have been published in the newspapers many times, and there is no need to repeat them. In order to lead all users in the special district to fight to the end and to set an example, this federation will first disconnect its own telephone, sacrificing its own interests and setting an example for all users in the city. The explanation issued by the telephone company, recognizing this federation's claims of fooling telephone users, is not worth a smile from those in the know. However, this federation believes that this explanation is a cunning means by the company to deceive users, so that users enter its shell in order to satisfy its own selfish desires. The claim that the record forms used are the same as those used in major cities around the world and that the records are accurate is also self-deception. There are several cases of users in the city reporting the floating meter numbers to the telephone association every day, and it is not just idle talk, and there are letters available for verification. Therefore, it is clear that the new rate is difficult for general users to sympathize with. According to the company's telephone user directory this year, it has decreased compared to last winter. The user directory for the winter of the year before last had 488 pages, while the user directory for this spring has only 426 pages, a shortage of 62 pages. With 74 households per page, more than 4,500 households have been disconnected this year due to the new tariffs being unbearable, not including those disconnected after the telephone directory was printed. The telephone of this federation was disconnected after the telephone directory was printed, and the name of this federation is still printed in the directory. Therefore, the company's authorities claim that thousands of users have voluntarily requested installation after the implementation of the new regulations is simply a deception. In order to implement our past claims and to show with facts to persuade the company to realize, we hereby issue the above statement regarding the progress of the matter."</p>

<p>Mussolini's Profound and Far-Reaching Considerations Are Formidable</p>
<p>Russia Carries Out Child Welfare with National Power</p>
<p>Ms. Xiong Zhi, foreign inspector of the China Child Welfare Association, traveled abroad last year to inspect the child welfare work in the United States and other countries. She has now completed her inspection and arrived in port after returning home a few days ago. News of this has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday at noon, the executive committee of the China Child Welfare Association and Ms. Xiong's relatives and friends held a welcome banquet at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao. Xiong Zhi, Xiong Xiling and his wife, Ms. Ding Shujing, Ms. Guan Cuizhen, Ms. Xia Shi, Mrs. Guo Keti, Mrs. Huang Xiufeng, Chen Heqin, Lu Ganjun, Quan Shaowu, Zhao Jinqing, Li Tingan, Wu Weide, Xu Jianping, Chen Tiesheng, Chen Zhengfan and other thirty people attended. Ms. Xiong gave a speech on the spot about the child welfare work in Germany, Italy, Russia, and the United States, Britain, and France, stating:</p>
<p>German Child Welfare</p>
<p>The work is mostly managed by private organizations and subsidized by the government. The German government established the Mother and Child Protection Department in 1934 to handle pregnant women's nutrition, infant nutrition, and subsidize working mothers for summer vacations by the sea. Throughout the country, there are mother and child protection centers, staffed by women with higher education, serving the community. Currently, there are 24,000 protection centers nationwide, with over 100,000 female service personnel, assisting 110,000 working mothers to rest in the suburbs and by the sea. The National Socialist Party advocates that women should have the ability to manage household affairs. Currently, more than 300,000 women nationwide are receiving training for motherhood. In Berlin, the capital of Germany, there are 45 nurseries of all sizes. The other nurseries and kindergartens scattered throughout the country total 12,000.</p>
<p>The Italian Government</p>
<p>Established the Central Mother and Child Protection Association in 1925. Branches are set up in each province and city in the country to handle pregnant women's examinations, pregnant women's lodging, pregnant women's shelters, protection of illegitimate children, protection of delinquent children, and protection of weak children. Funds are derived from national tax revenues, so they are abundant. The personnel who handle child welfare are all specially trained by the state, so all measures are in line with scientific principles. Mussolini vigorously advocates population reproduction. In nurseries and kindergartens everywhere, there are eye-catching slogans pasted on the walls that say, "Who has bestowed such abundance of food and clothing and such a perfect environment?" The answer below is, "It is Italy and Mussolini." His profound and far-reaching considerations are formidable and deserve attention.</p>
<p>The New Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is carrying out child welfare with the power of the entire country, which is beyond the reach of any other country. Nurseries are established everywhere in the country. According to Soviet law, any factory must have nursery facilities. One-fourth of workers' salaries and 10% of workers' insurance premiums must be used for childcare. Therefore, the effectiveness of their child welfare is very great. There is a national mother and child protection association that manages nurseries, kindergartens, and guides pregnant women's hygiene, abortion, and birth control. In Moscow, there is a national mother and child protection exhibition hall, where all issues related to the happiness of mothers and children are explained in concrete and material terms, so that the general working men and women can understand them at a glance and be shocked. The method is very good. Soviet Russia is working hard to promote the education of children. During the first five-year plan, it was estimated that the education of 500,000 children would be completed, and by the end of the first five-year plan, the education of 4 million children would be completed. The goal of the second five-year plan currently in progress is 10 million children. In addition to nurseries and kindergartens, Soviet Russia also has children's hospitals, children's courts, children's playgrounds, children's party research institutes, etc. Although Soviet Russian parents entrust their children to public institutions for upbringing, the natural love between parents and children has not diminished. Not long ago, Stalin returned to his hometown to visit his mother. How his old mother received him at that time, and how Stalin responded, were all shown on the Soviet screen (film). From this, it can be known that the world's misunderstanding of Soviet Russia as having no family or no human relations is baseless.</p>
<p>France and Other Countries</p>
<p>France is a country where individualism is excessively developed, so its child welfare work has no overall systematic organization and shows a rather chaotic shape. The British Mother and Child Protection Association has achieved great results, and the American Children's Army Research has made great achievements and cannot be compared to any other country. After Ms. Xiong's speech, Chairman Chen Tiesheng thanked her on behalf of the organization and reported that Ms. Xiong will depart for Nanjing tomorrow, and then transfer to Changsha, Nanchang, and other places to handle personal affairs, and will compile the results of her inspection and submit them to the China Child Welfare Association's Modern Parents Monthly for publication, contributing to the people of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Investigating the Origin of a Handgun from Bullet Examination: Several Robbers Arrested, Involving Detectives Zheng Bucai from the Public Security Bureau. Three Robbers, including Hua Jinsen, Remain in Custody for Further Investigation <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>On the 20th of this month, at approximately 1:00 AM, while Qian Yi Xiang Hotel at 393 Mei Bai Ge Road was closing, two robbers suddenly broke in. Robber A pulled out a handgun and made threatening gestures, while Robber B forced the hotel clerk, Ye Xiquan, to hand over the keys. They then opened the cash box and robbed eight yuan in various national currencies. As they were about to flee, Fan Tianfu (age 60, from Zhenjiang), a shareholder of the hotel, stepped forward and grabbed the hand of Robber A holding the gun. Another hotel clerk, Liu Zhifu (age 20, from Hunan), grabbed a stool and resisted, shouting loudly. This angered Robber A, who opened fire.</p>
<p>Handgun Fires Five Times</p>
<p>Both robbers fled quickly. Fan Tianfu and Liu Zhifu both fell to the ground injured. Upon receiving the alarm, the Xin Zha police station immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. The two injured men were taken to the hospital. Doctors determined that Fan Tianfu had suffered bullet wounds to his neck and left arm, with significant blood loss and severe injuries. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Liu Zhifu's injuries were in his lungs, and treatment was ineffective, leading to his death. His body was sent to the coroner's office. The Special Court No. 1 Prosecutor's Office conducted an autopsy. The bullets found in the deceased's body were sent to the Bureau of Public Works for testing.</p>
<p>Gun Examination Expert</p>
<p>Determined that the bullets were fired from a Ning brand .32 caliber gun. Based on this clue, the police arrested three suspects the day before yesterday: Hua Jinsen (age 39), a former platoon leader of the security brigade from Jiangbei; Xia Jinliang (age 44); and Xu Renhe (also known as Xu Aichuan, age 35). Zhang Zuoxian, who was working as volunteer detective number 182 at the Caojiadu 6th District Public Security Bureau, had a conflict with Chinese police in the jurisdiction of the Di Si Cheng Road police station in January of this year while carrying a Ning brand handgun. As a result, Zhang was taken to the police station, and the handgun he was carrying was test-fired by the Bureau of Public Works handgun division, and the</p>
<p>Shell Casings Stored for Investigation</p>
<p>Later, Zhang was released. Now, the Bureau of Public Works handgun division has determined that the bullets taken from Liu Zhifu's body match the bullets from the handgun Zhang carried earlier, and were fired from the same gun. Therefore, Ding Huaguo, Ma Zhongrong, Yang Feizhang, and Zhang Kunfeng, along with foreign detective Hui Erkousi, from the Xin Zha police station's drug investigation team went to the 6th District Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday and explained the situation. Zhang Zuoxian was then detained by the bureau chief. According to Zhang, the handgun was purchased from a certain</p>
<p>Foreign Sailor</p>
<p>For 40 yuan last September. However, on April 26th of this year, he resold it for 40 yuan to Hua Jinsen of the Yingli Rickshaw Company on Chang'an Road in Zhabei. Chinese and foreign detectives then went to 25 Hengfu Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, and arrested Hua Jinsen. Hua was writing a receipt for Zhang Zuoxian's sale of the handgun at the time. However, the date on the receipt was backdated to April 26th. Zheng Bucai and Wang Yucai, two detectives from the Public Security Bureau, were also present (as brokers for the sale of the gun) and were arrested together. A licensed handgun and 26 bullets were found on Hua. The police then went to 28 and 21 Da Yang Bridge and arrested accomplices Xia Jinliang and Xu Renhe in two straw sheds. In addition to Zhang Zuoxian, Zheng Buhe, and Wang Yucai, the three detectives were</p>
<p>Temporarily Detained</p>
<p>The remaining three suspects, Hua, Xia, and Xu, were taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the 8th Criminal Court of the Special Court No. 1. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyinxiang, described the above situation, stating that although a handgun was found on Hua Jinsen, it was a Colt brand and different from the handgun used in the crime. Therefore, he requested that the three suspects be kept in custody in order to</p>
<p>Continue the Investigation</p>
<p>Of the murder weapon, etc. When questioned, Hua Jinsen confessed that he had purchased the handgun from Zhang Zuoxian and that Xu Renhe had introduced him to Huang Si and Huang Tie, to whom he sold the gun. His testimony regarding the robbery and murder was evasive. He hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Tan Xinzhen reviewed the confession and ordered that Hua, Xia, and Xu be detained for seven days for further questioning. He also ordered the police station to take the arrested suspects to the hospital so that the injured Fan Tianfu could identify them.</p>

<p>Zhong Zhigang, a law student at Datong University at 338 Zhongshan Road, Shanghai West, and a native of Zhuji, Zhejiang (his father is the current president of a certain branch of the High Court), and Xu Qiang, a Wuxi native residing at 22 Hongde Lane, Guoqing Road, were arrested and detained at the Old Zha police station for disobeying the commands of Foreign Police Officer No. 330 at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road and assaulting the officer. The facts are that the Public Concession police recently erected ropes on all four sides of the sidewalk corners at the intersection of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road for the convenience of directing traffic. Pedestrians crossing the street must go around the ropes and cross at the yellow lines painted on the road, and may not cross directly in the middle. On that day, Xu Qiang exited the Great New Company and jumped over the ropes into the middle of the road, intending to cross the street. Foreign Police Officer No. 330, who was stationed there to manage traffic, stepped forward to stop him. However, a conflict arose, and Xu Qiang resorted to violence. Zhong, who was nearby, also jumped over the ropes and stepped forward to help Xu, resulting in the foreign police officer sustaining four injuries to his chest and other parts of his body. Zhong and Xu were arrested by other police officers and detained at the Old Zha police station. Zhong continued to be defiant at the police station, and the police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the 2nd Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case and filed charges of obstructing official duties and assault under Article 135 of the law. Foreign Police Officer No. 330 and Chinese police officers testified about the situation at the time. When questioned, Zhong Zhigang stated that he saw the foreign police officer beating Xu and came forward to help out of a sense of justice, but he did not beat the police officer, and instead, he was brutally beaten. Xu Qiang also denied beating the foreign police officer. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the confession and sentenced Zhong Zhigang to three months in prison and Xu Qiang to 50 days of detention, each with a two-year suspended sentence and probation. The police station indicated that they would appeal. Zhong's lawyer, Fan Gang, requested bail. The court then ordered Zhong to post a 500-yuan bond during the appeal period, and Xu was returned to custody.</p>

<p>Zhou Xiantong, a local resident, 51 years old, residing at 30 Yidalui, Tilam Bo Huade Road, went to the Tilamqiao Bank of Communications branch yesterday morning around 9:00 AM to withdraw 50 yuan. As he was returning home, four robbers, who had been watching him withdraw the money, followed him closely. When Zhou returned to the intersection of Yidali Road, the four robbers suddenly jumped ahead and grabbed Zhou, ordering him to hand over the money. Zhou refused to let go, leading to a struggle. At the same time, onlookers gathered and questioned the cause of the dispute. One of the robbers, becoming anxious, pulled out a handgun and fired a shot into Zhou's abdomen, abandoning the loot and fleeing together. By the time the patrol police arrived, it was too late. They rushed Zhou Xiantong to the hospital for treatment, where it was found that his intestines had been pierced by the bullet, and he was in critical condition.</p>

<p>Notorious gangsters Hangzhou Haier, Xiazi Xin Gen, Gu Qingbao, and others specialize in gathering people to gamble on various ships, taking commissions for profit. Their scale is very large, and their arrest is extremely difficult. The police station in Hongkou once cracked down on them, so they recently moved to a better location. They are now reorganizing at the Gonghexiang Wharf, 610 Dongfeng Old Huilu, on the Desheng steamer of the Jardine Matheson Company, recruiting gamblers, calling out numbers, gambling day and night, with huge winnings and losses. Huishan police station Chinese detective Zhou Guisen and detectives Cui Chengke, Zhao Yongqing, Shen Binkui, and others learned of this. At 4:30 PM on the day before yesterday, detectives Cui and Zhao disguised themselves as gamblers and infiltrated the Desheng steamer. At the height of the gambling, they notified Detective Zhou, who immediately led a large number of detectives to arrest them. The head of the operation, Gu Qingbao from Tongzhou (also known as Zhixiang, previously sentenced to ten years in prison for an assassination case, acquitted on appeal, and also sentenced by the court for flower club and other cases), Liu Shude from Ningbo, and gamblers Gu Jinsheng (also known as Xiao Jinsheng), Jin Weixin, Sun Qingsheng, Cai Fuzhang, Yu Laifang, Li Yao, Chen Jinhai, Fu Aqing, Wang Hailin, Hua Jinlong, Liu Guisheng, Deng Yingfa, Gao Qifang, and women Shen Wangshi, Zhou Fanshi, Fan Qinshi, Zhuang Zhangshi, and 78 others were arrested. Gambling equipment, pai gow, three dice cups, twelve dice, more than 349 yuan in paper currency, and other gambling equipment were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Pang Zhishan, filed charges under Articles 266 and 268 of the law. Gu Zhixiang, Liu Shude, Sun Qingsheng, Chen Jinhai, Xin Tianfang, Yu Zhongxiao, Shao Yongkang, Yang Jinyuan, Zhu Deqing, Shao Jiliang, Zhou Zhenggen, and others among the arrested were found to have been previously convicted by the court, so they will be further investigated for any recent crimes and will await trial. Judge Zhan Liangce, who was hearing this case, was busy with many other trivial cases and did not have time to hear the case, so he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the afternoon. In the afternoon, Judge Zhan questioned the case in the Criminal Court No. 1. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhi, explained the case, and the detective in charge explained the arrest. The presiding judge questioned the defendants and ruled that because the crime occurred in Hanoi, it should be handled by the Shanghai District Court. Gu Qingbao and Liu Shude were each released on a 200-yuan bail, and the others were released on a 100-yuan bail, and were ordered to surrender themselves to the District Court.</p>

<p>Guo Shanyu, from Anhui, 36 years old, was arrested in January 1933 for a murder case in the French Concession. He was sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and sentenced to a long prison term, which he is currently serving in the Second Special Prison. Recently, Guo reported that the warden Jia Furong and Wu Lu were harboring murderer Gu Zhuxuan for opium use in the Guangci Hospital prison ward. After investigation, the prosecutor first filed charges against the two wardens, Jia and Wu, and they were sentenced to five years each in prison. As for Gu Zhuxuan, the judicial police department filed charges with the Second Special Court on the 20th of this month. When Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the hearing in Criminal Court No. 8, he ordered the original complainant, Guo, to be brought to the court for questioning. After the adjournment, he ordered that he be returned to the prison. Guo suddenly resisted prison regulations, refused to be searched by the guards, and argued with the guards. After investigating, the second section chief of the prison determined that Guo was obstructing official duties and sent Guo to the Lujiawan French police station for prosecution. After investigation by detective Yao Zhupo from the police force, Guo was escorted to the Second Special Court yesterday. Judge Chen Pusheng presided over the hearing in Criminal Court No. 8. The police force lawyer, Fei Xizhen, explained the case and filed charges of obstructing official duties under Article 135 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, Guo Shanyu testified: "When I was being sent back to the prison, the second section chief saw me and told the guards that I would be suing Gu Zhuxuan in court again. He ordered three guards to slap me in the face and handcuff me behind my back and lock me up. I was not released until 10:00 AM the next morning and sent to the police station. When Gu Zhuxuan's case was being heard, Warden Jia told me not to say too much, but when the judge asked me in court, I dared not lie. When I returned to the prison, I was beaten by the police force and suffered injuries all over my body. I ask for an examination. I am currently ill. Please send me back to the prison for treatment." The court reviewed the confession and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 28th and that the suspect remain in custody.</p>

<p>Gui Yanfang, the manager of the Xinyu Textile Company on Laobosheng Road, previously received extortion letters from gangsters demanding 20,000 yuan. Gui reported this to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest suspects Sun Yuanlin and Zhou Xiangda. They were escorted to the First Special Court, where the interrogation was completed and they were awaiting sentencing.

Judge Tan sentenced Sun Yuanlin and Zhou Xiangda to two years imprisonment each for jointly and repeatedly trying to extort money. The six threatening letters were confiscated. After the verdict was announced, the judicial police detectives received the case and declared that the two defendants had also committed another case in the French Concession and requested a transfer for questioning.

<p>Chen Dalang, a 25-year-old man from Wuxi, used to run a beef business. Recently, he lost his job and was heavily in debt, making it difficult to make a living. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, he wrote an extortion letter and delivered it to Xu Chen, a Pudong woman who runs a beef stall at 26 Yu Ye Lane, Mile Road, asking to borrow 200 yuan, saying that it should be wrapped in paper money and placed in a trash can at the entrance of the lane, marked with a red paper with the account number on the wall, indicating agreement, otherwise he would resort to drastic measures. After receiving the letter, she ignored it. On the morning of the 23rd, she received another similar letter, stating that if there was no response, she would be killed. In a panic, she wrapped a package of newspaper on the afternoon of that day to resemble 200 yuan in banknotes and put it in the trash can with a strip of red paper high up next to the wall. Together with three neighbors, Tang Alin and others, she secretly reported to the Hongkou police station, which sent Chinese detective Zhang Shoushan to the lane to wait and see what would happen. After a while, Chen Dalang came and picked up the package in the trash can. As he was about to flee, he was arrested and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special Court. Bureau of Public Works lawyer Zhang Shizhu elaborated on the case and requested an investigation. Xu Chen, the victim, Tang Alin, the landlord, and Hua Detective Zhang Shan reported the incident. The threatening letter and paper package were presented for inspection. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was in financial difficulties and had resorted to this tactic. Judge Xiao Biancai sentenced Chen Dalang to one year and two months imprisonment, and the threatening letters were confiscated.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Verdict in Blue Car Case: Zhou Richang Sentenced to One Month, Suspended for Three Years <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Richang, a 42-year-old Cantonese and son of Zhou Taochen, the current chairman of the Nanjiu Brothers Tobacco Company, residing at 6 Xinmin Village, Huanlong Road, French Concession, recently established the Blue Car Company and rented a house at 546 Yaerbei Road. He planned to open on the first of last month, began preparations, and recruited more than a dozen drivers, laborers, doormen, and patrol police, collecting deposits from them and setting salaries. The workers went to the company to choose their jobs. However, after a long time, no cars were delivered and the business did not start. The workers asked for their deposits back, but Zhou refused to pay. The workers then realized that they had been deceived. The workers, led by Wang Guanghe, jointly filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Zhou Richang, Yao Qixiang, and others of fraud, and filed an ancillary civil lawsuit to recover the deposits. After two court hearings, Zhou Richang failed to appear. Until the court issued a summons for his arrest, Zhou appeared on the 21st of this month with his defense lawyer. After questioning by Judge Qiu, he announced the end of the trial and set a date for sentencing. The situation has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu of the Second Special Court presided over the hearing in Criminal Court No. 2 and sentenced Zhou Richang to two months imprisonment, suspended for three years, for jointly using fraud to induce others to hand over their property. The defendant was also ordered to jointly return the 158 yuan in deposits. The remaining civil lawsuit was dismissed and transferred to the civil court for execution.</p>

<p>Yu Shunqing, a standing committee member of the Shanghai National Coal Production Association, in order to promote national oil and strengthen national defense, has joined with leaders from all walks of life to establish Puyi Oil Company. The first step is to investigate oil mines in the border provinces, and the public oil survey team has been organized. In addition to sending letters to all sectors to solicit participation, Yu also issued an open letter to fellow countrymen to raise awareness. The original text reads: "I have investigated that the raw materials for lighting lamps in our country have always been vegetable oils extracted from domestically produced cottonseeds, soybeans, rapeseed, etc. Since the opening of the sea ban, during the Tongzhi era of the late Qing Dynasty, American Mobil Oil Company shipped hundreds of boxes of kerosene to China for trial sales. Mr. Ye Chengzhong, a large businessman from Ningbo, was asked to be the distributor, with Nanshun as the sole agent. It started from Hankou and other ports along the Yangtze River and gradually expanded. Then the American company switched to bulk shipping of kerosene to Shanghai, purchased dozens of acres of farmland in Pudong, and built wharves and oil pools to store bulk oil for immediate sale. Ye also provided huge sums to build more than a dozen wooden boats (i.e., duck butts) specifically to transport kerosene between Shanghai, Hankou, Ningbo, and other ports, allowing it to be sold in inland towns in various provinces. Because it was convenient for the public to try it, it became a habit, and vegetable oil from rapeseed, soybeans, and cottonseeds declined sharply and could not recover. By the 20th year of the Guangxu era, two foreign companies, German merchants Ruiji and Miya, were also engaged in kerosene business. Within a few years, the two companies reorganized and named themselves Asia Petroleum Company. Recently, Texaco and Guanghua have emerged one after another, not joining the American and Asian companies. In recent years, science has flourished, and machinery has been updated daily. Automobiles, airplanes, etc., have increased. The utility of oil is increasing day by day. Examining its sources, all are supplied by foreign imports. Although this is the economic aggression of foreigners, it is because our people do not know how to adopt methods, letting the goods be discarded on the ground. The huge amount of money flowing out of the Wusongkou is more than a hundred million. The impact on the national economy has become depleted. Although the crisis is removed, it can still be remedied. All citizens should quickly wake up and catch up quickly. Do not follow the old path. Petroleum is an urgent matter internally and externally. Aviation, transportation, and factories need it urgently and cannot be interrupted for a moment. If we have prejudices about overseas inspections and domestic investigations, and contribute them to the government for adoption, this is the obligation and responsibility that a citizen should have. I hope that my fellow countrymen will pay attention to it. Shunqing now intends to organize a public oil survey team to sacrifice spirit and economy within the possible range to assist the government, promote national oil, and develop resources to save the crisis and plug the leak. I deeply hope that all sectors of the country will enthusiastically refer to it and teach it. I would be very grateful."</p>

<p>Zhu Guangbu, a Wuxi native residing at 1308 Hehe Lane, Laobosheng Road, Shanghai West, works at a certain exchange and has considerable savings. At about 12:00 noon yesterday, four robbers suddenly came, wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, speaking with an Anhui accent. One robber was on the lookout outside, and three robbers entered the house and locked Zhu's female relatives in the back room of the living room, and then ransacked the house, emptying boxes and bags, stealing jewelry, gold bars, and valuable jewelry, worth more than 1,000 yuan. On the spot, they tore the sheets and bundled them up to escape. At that time, a neighbor surnamed Zhang learned of this and reported it to patrol officer No. 1341. The patrol officer heard the news and rushed to the scene. One robber fled and was arrested. Unexpectedly, another robber behind him, seeing his accomplice being arrested, urgently fired a shot. The patrol officer fell to the ground but still got up with his injuries and chased after him. The two sides then fired at each other, and the sound of gunfire was like a string of beads. The four robbers fled to the wasteland behind Hengye Lane and waded through the Caoxie River. The patrol officer bravely continued to chase them relentlessly and fired several shots, finally hitting one of the robbers. The package that the robber was carrying, containing the original stolen goods, was recovered. Chinese patrol officer No. 1736 also heard the gunfire and arrived in time. He saw the robber crawling on the ground, still trying to resist, so he quickly assisted in opening fire and killed the robber on the spot. However, the previously captured unarmed robber and the other two robbers still managed to escape. Afterwards, the two patrol officers immediately telegraphed the police station and asked them to notify the Laobosheng Road police station to pay attention to the whereabouts of the three robbers and assist in the arrest. As for the robber's body, it was sent to the coroner's office for autopsy. The injured Chinese patrol officer is currently being treated in the hospital and is expected to be safe.</p>

<p>The Fifth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter yesterday to the Taxpayer Association of Chinese Lawyers, stating: "According to a letter from Ruixing Restaurant, No. 153 Kangti Road, at 9:10 am on April 25th, a vegetable vendor was temporarily parked on the roadside in front of our restaurant. A female customer passing by bought vegetables from him. While the transaction was in progress, a Westerner from the Health Bureau passed by on a bicycle, stopped and intervened. The vendor saw him and fled, leaving a few vegetable leaves behind in a hurry. The Westerner chased the vendor unsuccessfully and returned to the restaurant, ordering us to sweep away the vegetable leaves. We immediately obeyed the order and swept them away. Unexpectedly, the Westerner secretly copied down our restaurant's door number and sent a letter the next day stating that we were fined three yuan for dumping garbage, which is shocking. The Westerner witnessed the vendor fleeing and whether the person buying the vegetables was from our restaurant. Because we pay attention to cleanliness, we swept away the leaves on behalf of the vendor, but we were rewarded with a fine. How can this be considered fair? We went to the Health Bureau to negotiate, but we could not reason with them. After repeated reminders of the fine, we refused to pay it, but after a month, the police suddenly summoned us to pay the fine. In such a situation, how can we merchants do business? Therefore, we specially request your association to negotiate. The Health Bureau's staff in the legal circle often create troubles and abuse fines, which happen every day. According to reports from our members, the above-mentioned letter from the restaurant shows that the bureau's abuse of fines and unreasonable harassment of merchants is particularly obvious. It is urgent to seriously negotiate and find a way to correct it to reassure merchants and citizens. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to request you to forward it to the French Municipal Council for negotiation and immediate correction to maintain commerce."</p>

<p>Chen Shiying, a 35-year-old man from Shaoxing, residing at No. 18 Tangjiawan, and Qin Chunsheng, a 27-year-old man from Pingwang, were unemployed and hatched a plan to take advantage of the upcoming summer season. They used the name of a charity to privately print solicitation books and receipts to solicit donations from door to door in the Fangbang Road area of the city to set up "tea pavilions" for public benefit, embezzling the donations to enrich themselves. When soliciting donations from the Hexing Rubber Shoe Store at No. 238 of that road, the store owner Yang Taijun suspected fraud and refused to donate, which angered Chen and Qin. They started with verbal arguments and then resorted to violence. The incident was reported to the police officer Fan Qifeng, who detained them in the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After questioning by Inspector Chen, it was determined that the defendants were illegally enriching themselves under false pretenses. They were ordered to be handed over to the bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Xu Qingyun (also known as A'mao), the deceased owner of Taichangxiang Foreign Goods Store at the Dongxinqiao intersection of Fada Road, was a native of Pudong and possessed nearly two million in assets. He owned a house on Annajin Road. During his lifetime, Xu married a fellow villager, Chen, and had a daughter named Daxin (35 years old this year). Later, Xu took another Chen as a concubine, and had a son named Fusheng and daughters named Lanzhen and Huizhen. Because Xu favored his concubine and neglected his wife, the old couple's relationship broke down, and his wife Chen filed a lawsuit in the French Concession Court in 1931 to request a divorce. After reconciliation between the two parties, a contract was signed at the residence of the plaintiff's lawyer Zheng Yuxiu on Haig Road. Lawyers Jin Yu, Li Xinyang, and Ren Zhennan witnessed the contract, and Wang Jimen acted as the scrivener. Only Xu's wife Chen was present at the signing. Xu himself signed it later. Later, Xu's daughter Daxin discovered that her signature was on the divorce contract of her parents, and there were words such as "the second party will never claim any property from the first party in the future." Daxin immediately sent a letter to her father to object, and also filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against lawyers Zheng and Li for breach of trust, which has not yet been resolved. Xu passed away in 1933, and the matter concerning Daxin's name was shelved. Recently, Xu Daxin appointed three lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Peng Yuanxun, and Zhang Ding, to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court on the civil division against her father's concubine Xu Chen, her younger brother and sisters Xu Fusheng, Xu Lanzhen, and Xu Huizhen, seeking confirmation that the contract was invalid. The case was once opened for trial by Judge Ma Yishu, who instructed that the hearing be rescheduled for further questioning of witnesses. It has been reported. Yesterday was another scheduled hearing day. Both parties were represented by lawyers. Only the scrivener Wang Jimen appeared as a witness. According to the witness, "The divorce contract between Xu Qingyun and his wife was written by me. Only Xu Chen was present at the signing at that time. Xu Qingyun and Xu Daxin's parents were not present. Xu Qingyun's signature was added later. The clause stating that the second party would never claim any property from the first party was also added by me two weeks later." Judge Ma verified the testimony and instructed that the hearing be rescheduled for June 4th to summon witnesses Jin Yu and Li Xinyang for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Relief Association Uncovers Trafficking Case on Yi Sheng Steamer <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Trafficker Yu Fusheng, along with the fugitive Fang Yuanzhang, and the arrested trafficker Li Liu, and Fang's mother Fang Sun, etc., organized a trafficking agency to abduct women in various inland areas and transport them for export and profitable sale. On the 13th of this month, Fang Yuanzhang transported Zhao Xiaolan Ying, a woman from Yangzhou (20 years old), and Chen Lingdi, a woman from Jintan (15 years old), for export, boarding the Yi He Company's Yi Sheng steamer to depart. Before the ship set sail, Relief Association investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, together with water patrol police Bao Tan Li Wenqi and Gu Wenkui, boarded the ship to investigate the trafficking. Fang Yuanzhang was experienced in this, and recognized the faces of the police officers, so he took the opportunity to avoid them, and watched coldly. Indeed, they saw them questioning Zhao Xiaolan Ying and others. Fang then fled. The investigators learned from the women that Fang Yuanzhang was trafficking them, and that Fang lived at No. 63 Laohai Road. Chen Lingdi said that she was abducted from Jintan by Yu Fusheng, a fellow villager. The two women were taken to the police station, and they also went to the Laozha Police Station to arrest Yu Fusheng, who confessed that he was abducted by Li Liu, who lived at No. 10 Fuan Lane, Qiujiang Road. They immediately went to the North Railway Station Branch to arrest Li Liu, and also arrested Fang's mother Fang Sun. Chen Lingdi was sent to the association for care. Prosecutor Xiao has filed a public prosecution against Yu Fusheng, Li Liu, Fang Sun, and the fugitive Fang Yuanzhang. Yesterday, Judge Zhang opened the court for trial. Investigator Lin Yongfang, who handled the case, testified about the situation at that time. The official interrogated the defendants, who confessed without denial. The case was then concluded, and the sentencing was scheduled. The defendants were taken back into custody.</p>

<p>Cao Fengqing, a local, was involved in a land dispute with fellow clansmen Cao Yueliu, Cao Zhenglun, and Cao Lanqing in the local court. The day before yesterday, Judge Cao Baozhen opened the court for trial and attempted to reconcile the parties. However, Cao Fengqing refused to accept the reconciliation and even ranted in court. It was considered that Cao Fengqing was disrespecting the dignity of the court and should be reprimanded. It was learned that Cao held a grudge in his heart, and the next day, Judge Cao received a letter full of attacks and slanderous insults against the judge. Judge Cao was furious and immediately transferred the original letter to the Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday, Prosecutor Kong sent the police to summon Cao for preliminary interrogation and ordered his detention pending investigation and legal action.</p>

They spoke in a mixture of local and northern accents. They broke in through the front door, first asking if they were looking for someone named Mao, then falsely claiming to be there to inspect red pill drugs. After entering the house, three of the robbers took out pistols and held everyone in the house captive. They then searched the bedrooms of Mao's mother and wife for more than an hour before leaving. After checking the losses, it was estimated that more than 1,400 yuan in cash, along with gold bracelets, pearl bracelets, gold lockets, gold necklaces, gold hairpins, gold rings, pearl flowers, pearl rings, jade, gold rings, gemstones, and 40 yuan in cash from a female guest surnamed Pan, and 70 yuan in cash from Mao's wife, were stolen, totaling 3,000 to 4,000 taels of gold.

<p>In order to facilitate the payment of field taxes for businesses in various counties in Jiangsu Province, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank has specially set up an agency to collect field taxes on behalf of businesses. The procedure is that the business fills out a power of attorney, together with the field tax collection notice and the tax payment, and submits it to the bank's branches in various counties for counting. The bank will then stamp the power of attorney with the bank's seal and the handler's seal, and the original power of attorney will be given to the principal to be collected as a voucher for exchanging the ticket. For entrusting the payment of old taxes and overdue new taxes, it is necessary to attach the notice and contact the Field Tax Office of the county government to check the amount of taxes and overdue fines, and then notify the principal to pay the money to the bank. The above measures are currently being tested in Shanghai, Baoshan, Wujin, Wuxian, Wujiang, Kunshan, Changshu, Songjiang, Jiading, Wuxi, Qingpu, Fengxian, Jinshan, Xuanxing, Jiangyin, and Jinshan, etc. If it is successful in the future, it will be promoted to other counties.</p>

<p>The Freedom Light Bulb invented by Mr. Bao Yi has been under preparation for half a year since Mr. Yu Weiqing from Chengren invested in setting up the Qite Freedom Light Bulb Factory. It has started manufacturing on April 1st. The copper head of this Freedom Light Bulb can make the attached light bulb emit five kinds of light with different intensities, which is equivalent to one bulb having the use of five bulbs. The filament in the light bulb is divided into three strands. If one strand is damaged, the other two strands can still be used successively. Therefore, in terms of economy and durability, it is better than ordinary light bulbs. The internal structure of the light bulb has been completely successful after months of practical testing and dozens of research and improvements. The excellent quality of the product is enough to satisfy users. Since the factory started, it has manufactured more than 52,000 Freedom Light Bulbs and more than 30,000 ordinary light bulbs, and it will be officially opened on the 27th of this month. On that day, Mr. Yu and Mr. Bao will invite reporters to visit the general factory at No. 457 North Henan Road. If all sectors of society come to guide us, we would be most welcome. Fellow countrymen who love to use domestic goods should be able to support and adopt this excellent domestic product.</p>

<p>The Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Three-Province Unified Tax Office had previously stipulated regulations that all yarns transported from Shanghai to the mainland must be transported to Shanghai with a tax-paid license and a stamp from the local inspection office, so that the woven fabrics could be transported to Shanghai for resale. Recently, the Changshu County Inspection Office was suddenly ordered to be abolished, but the manufacturers were not notified in advance, and 160 pieces of fabric were still shipped to Shanghai in batches according to precedent. Suddenly, the Shanghai Inspection Office detained all the fabrics transported to Shanghai because the procedures were not in compliance. The manufacturers believe that this handicraft industry still maintains the livelihood of most farmers and also serves as a supplement to the rural sideline economy. Now that it has been suddenly detained, the manufacturers' business will be hit, which will inevitably have a great impact on the rural areas. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, together with the Changshu Cloth Factory Association, sent representatives Wang Shaojun, Wang Guanqin, Zheng Lanxi, and other three people to petition the Unified Tax Office. As a result, the Tax Office expressed its acceptance of their petition. The association representatives intend to ask the Shanghai Inspection Office to return the goods today.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Passenger Missing on Jiangxin Steamer; Seventeen Pieces of Luggage Left Behind; Similar Incident on Jiangda <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Passengers often go missing on Yangtze River steamers and commit suicide by jumping into the river. This time, on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River steamer Jiangda, which was on its way to Hankou, there was a passenger with a</p>
<p>Hubei accent.</p>
<p>While the ship was passing from Wuhu to Jiujiang, the passenger suddenly went missing. The steward searched everywhere, but found no trace. The shipowner was informed and, together with the military police, searched the passenger's cabin. Only one package of tattered clothes was found, containing several jiao and one yuan in legal tender. No suicide note was left behind. Where the passenger went missing is still unknown. The Jiangda has now returned to Shanghai and has reported the situation to the headquarters. The abandoned</p>
<p>luggage items</p>
<p>have also been sent to the headquarters for safekeeping. The headquarters, based on this point, has temporarily stored the items and is investigating the passenger's family members. Unexpectedly, and coincidentally, the Jiangxin steamer of the company, which returned to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, also had a similar incident. A passenger with an Upper Yangtze accent purchased a third-class ticket from a travel agency in Hankou to take the Jiangxin steamer to Shanghai. When disembarking, he carried as many as seventeen pieces of luggage. After boarding the ship, he changed to a second-class ticket, and the cabin he was in was</p>
<p>number twenty-eight.</p>
<p>However, when the ship arrived in Nanjing, the passenger disappeared. Whether he disembarked at various ports and was delayed, was unable to disembark, or committed suicide is difficult to determine. The Jiangxin has now returned to Shanghai, and the purser Liu Anqing reported to the headquarters and submitted the seventeen pieces of luggage to the headquarters for inspection. Even under examination, his name and location were unknown, and there were no other clues in the luggage. The headquarters has temporarily stored the seventeen pieces of luggage in the</p>
<p>storage warehouse</p>
<p>waiting for the passenger to come to Shanghai to prove and reclaim the luggage. At the same time, the headquarters has instructed the crew of each steamer to pay attention to the passengers on the ship in the future, and if they disembark, they must clearly inform them of the departure time to avoid any omissions.</p>

<p>Yang Shurong, the concubine of Jiang Xingjie, a wealthy merchant from Nanjing who traveled to Shanghai, came from a brothel. Since Jiang Xingjie passed away on January 22nd, 1934, he left behind a lot of property, which was all managed by Yang and her sons Guoyou and Guozhang. Now, Jiang Xingjie's other son, Guopei, has hired lawyers He Shimei and Fan Gang to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Yang, Jiang Guoyou, and Jiang Guozhang, seeking to be given one-third of his father's estate of three million yuan, which is equivalent to one million yuan in national currency. This case has been summoned several times by the Special Court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi opened the Civil Fourth Court for a continued hearing. Neither party appeared in court. Judge Peng first asked about the settlement process. The defendant's lawyer Jiang Yiping said, "Regarding this case, because both parties are members of the same family, for the convenience of settlement, we should first start investigating the amount of property and debts. If it has been listed in the will, then it will be handled according to the will. If it is not listed in the will, then it will be distributed according to law. Therefore, there was a meeting last week, but there were no results due to the different opinions of both parties. It was agreed to discuss it again at 2 pm today, but the ruling on the preservation of evidence in the execution court was not implemented. Therefore, if a settlement is required, the plaintiff must be a little more sincere. If they do not proceed according to the regulations, but only seek to obtain cash, then it seems extremely difficult." The plaintiff's lawyer He said, "The plaintiff does not need cash. If there is property, divide the property, if there is cash, divide the cash. However, the settlement plan proposed by the defendant, such as the shares of Jinhua Company, are all treated as Yang's exclusive property and cannot be analyzed. Moreover, according to the investigation, the defendant's assets and debts are compared. In addition to the property, there are still debts of more than 400,000 yuan. Then the plaintiff will not only not be able to share the inheritance, but also have to bear more than 100,000 yuan of inheritance debts. Furthermore, according to the results of the provisional execution, it was found that a part of the property was not listed in the will. Also, Jiang Yang said that there was no safety deposit box, but the plaintiff found that there were two safety deposit boxes in Siming Bank under the names of Jiang Xingjie and Jiang Shurong, so he asked your court to ban them. Therefore, if a settlement is desired, the defendant must not be too calculating. Moreover, in the inventory of the estate, most of it is listed as Jiang Yang Shurong's property from her days as a prostitute. How can there be any special products? It is obviously purchased by Jiang Xingjie," and expressed that he did not recognize the will. After the judge informed the lawyers of both parties, they should be open to discuss a settlement method. Now, another opportunity is given. If a settlement cannot be reached at that time, the trial must proceed. Therefore, the judge postponed the hearing.</p>

<p>The drought disaster in Huoqiu, Anhui, is severe, and the victims are in dire need of relief. The Red Swastika Society previously sent Jiang Xichun and Chen Tianru with funds to investigate and provide relief. The society has now received a letter from Mr. Liu reporting that the disaster is intensifying and has become an unprecedented tragedy. Excerpts from the original letter are as follows, to inform the benevolent of all circles: (Omitted above) After Chun arrived in Huoqiu, he inspected the disaster area along the way, and his heart was broken by what he saw. Currently, people are eating people in the county, and there are even cases of digging up new graves, stealing corpses, and slaughtering the remains of those who have already starved to death, and selling their meat in the market. Such shocking events can be described as unprecedented. He then held a meeting with local officials and gentry to discuss relief measures. Everyone believed that the disaster was severe and the funds were insufficient, so the only option was to set up more porridge kitchens and provide extensive relief. At the same time, personnel were sent to various villages to distribute emergency relief. This month is a matter of life and death, and relief efforts must be carried out quickly. However, the disaster is severe and the funds are insufficient, and it is feared that it will be a drop in the bucket and difficult to provide universal relief. It is hoped that all societies will appeal to all sectors of society for vigorous assistance and continuous support to save these survivors. The sooner relief is provided, the better. If it is delayed, hundreds of thousands of compatriots may perish together.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Robbery of Police Equipment Case: More Accomplices Apprehended <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Li Xiaobao, the leader of the detective team of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, colluded with a gang to rob the handguns of the police on duty at Xibao Xing Road and Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei twice and framed innocent people. After the case was discovered, he fled. The true criminals who robbed the police handguns, Xu Xueqin and others, were captured by Liang Yu and Chu Jingwu, the leaders of the first team of the detective general team, and escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Liang and Chu, the two team leaders, also learned that the accomplices in the case, Yang Defu and Shi Dachengzi (i.e., Shi Wengyao), had fled to Changzhou after the incident. Therefore, Liang and Chu took class leader Gao Yachuan and others to Changzhou secretly a few days ago. With the assistance of the Changzhou County Government, Shi Dachengzi and the suspects Chen Jiaen and Xin Dahui were arrested in a teahouse in Ximen and brought to Shanghai. Xin Kunshan (also known as Xin Kunsheng) and Xin Faquan were then captured at 439 Hengkang Lane, Guangzhao Road, Zhabei. Yang Defu was extradited from the First Special District Court of the concession, and Xu Xueqin and Lu Jinchun were brought back from the garrison headquarters for confrontation. According to Shi Dachengzi's confession, he is 41 years old, from Funing, and lives at No. 4, Lane 2, Jiangwan Station Road. Ten days ago, Yang Defu and I were sent to the train by Li Xiaobao from a hotel opposite the Ximen Branch in a hired car. Before leaving, they gave us nine yuan for expenses. We took the slow fourth-class train to Wuxi. After dawn, we took another car to Changzhou. Two days after arriving at the Ximen Inn, Yang Defu gave me one yuan and told me to find business in Wuxi. Because I couldn't find business, I returned to Changzhou and stayed in the same inn for one night. I met Chen Songshan (i.e., Chen Jiaen). Because I didn't have any money, I ate at Chen Songshan's house until the day I was arrested in the teahouse the day before I came to Shanghai. Xu Xueqin, Yang Dekuan, Xin Faquan, and I went to rob the handguns of the two police officers on Xibao Xing Road and Gonghe Xin Road.</p>
<p>Xu Xueqin brought a gun. We only robbed one yuan at the cigarette and paper shop on Xibao Xing Road. Yang Defu and I went inside, and Xu Xueqin and Xin Faquan were outside. Xu held the gun against the police officer to rob the police's gun, and Dachengzi told me to take the gun away. We robbed several thousand copper coins on Gonghe Xin Road. Yang Defu, Xu Xueqin, and I went inside, and Xin Faquan was outside to watch. Unexpectedly, a police officer suddenly came out of the barber shop next door and grabbed Xin Faquan. Later, Xu Xueqin came out and fired a shot and took the gun from the police officer. Later, both guns were placed in my house. After a day, Xu came with an unknown person and told me to</p>
<p>Take out the police gun and take it to the South City and give it to Captain Li Xiaobao. The fair-skinned youth with gold teeth took it away. Later, they called Liu and three other people together, saying they were going to rob. The Ximen Detective Team's teahouse and Jin Yushan sent the police's guns to Liqiaotou and gave them to Liu and others. Before we left, Captain Li and others stepped forward and hugged Liu and others. Yang Defu confessed that he is 40 years old, from Qingjiang, and lives in a shed at the end of Datong Road in Zhabei. Xin Faquan confessed that he is 30 years old, from Funing, and lives in a shed on Zhonghua Xin Road. The confessions of the two were similar to Shi Dachengzi's. Xin Kunshan (i.e., Xin Kunsheng) claimed to be 31 years old, from Funing, and lives at 439 Hengkang Lane, Guangzhao Road. Yang Defu and Xin Faquan knew each other, but they did not know what they had done.</p>

<p>The Second Match in Saigon</p>
<p>Saigon's football, from the very start, was crude and vulnerable.  In previous years, domestic teams passing through this place all greeted them with crushing defeats.  But their pursuit of progress has increased with time.  It is only regrettable that they do not seek nobility in morality. Their sporting spirit shows absolutely no concern for investigation.  Each visit by a guest team brings a worse impression. I still remember in early summer last year when the Shanghai Mixed League team and the Southern Italian A and B combined team passed through Saigon one after another. Because their strength was not very complete, and with little drinking water available, our team changed its lineup, to:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Li Guocheng, Xu Yahui, Liang Rongzhao, Chen Zhenhe, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Zhuo Shijin, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>We were unable to gain a significant lead in the first half.  Many spectators worried about us. At the beginning of the second half, the enemy's momentum was formidable, repeatedly entering our territory. Fortunately, their shooting was inaccurate, and they did not score.  Not long after the resumption of play, the opponent took advantage of a penalty kick, and Xiao Bao was blocked by a defender, conceding a goal. This resulted in a 1-1 tie.  Vietnamese fans cheered wildly.  Our team calmly coped and quietly awaited an opportunity. Before long, Zhenhe, with a brave sprint, scored two goals in a row. The enemy revealed their true colors, and the outcome was decided. Before the end of the match, Feng, the center forward, made the score 4-1, ending a fierce battle and giving the overseas Chinese community a chance to cheer again. In this game, the opponent's strength was even stronger than yesterday. We were unable to withstand the fight due to the weather. Therefore, the battle was more spectacular. The referee was French, and they were encouraged by his boorish behavior, as well as the advantages of favorable weather and terrain. They defeated us one after another, creating an unprecedented record. The Vietnamese were arrogant and triumphant, while the overseas Chinese were frustrated and disappointed. This time, we have gathered the nation's elite to come, and they, with their crude skills, also vainly hoped to defeat us. Today's match is Saigon gathering its most outstanding football players to face us. We are also careful and cautious. Except for those injured in yesterday's game, everyone else is ready to play. My body is still recovering from illness, and I should be resting, but the overseas Chinese community strongly requested my appearance, and I could not refuse. So, I reluctantly played. The score was 1-0 in the first half, and the final result was 4-1. Goal scorers were Zhuo Shijin, Feng Jingxiang each one, and Chen Zhenhe two. At the beginning, we fielded the following formation:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Chen Zhenhe, Huang Meishun, Liang Rongzhao, Yang Shuiyi, Zhuo Shijin, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Today, the weather was favorable, and it did not rain all day. The field was relatively dry. The game started at 4:30. Considering our rapid progress in yesterday's game, the enemy was cautious from the start, with tight defenses and no gaps to exploit. It was not until the 22nd minute that Comrade Shijin scored first, and the first half ended at this point. Although the cooling rule is still vague, the referee added restrictions regarding rough plays, which was a significant improvement over yesterday's Vietnamese referee. However, there were still many illegal plays that are not allowed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, but he forgave and did not punish them. As a result, several of our players were still slightly injured by their rough plays. In the two matches, under harsh conditions and a rough environment, we were able to show great patience and restraint, never retaliating in kind to avoid unpleasant incidents in the chaotic scene. We must admire the cultivation and restraint of our famous players. Although we had a week of rest on the boat, our performance in the past two days still felt less than ideal. There was a lack of understanding in cooperation, and our strength felt insufficient. This is probably due to being in the tropics for the first time, and the weather has a significant impact. According to the observation of a French person, he said that we have enough skill, but our strength is still lacking. When facing strong European teams, we may be at a disadvantage because our stamina is not as good as theirs. Strength comes from training, and we will definitely work hard to remedy this weakness to eliminate the major problem of being willing but unable to do enough. Today, we will wait and see and look forward to the future.</p>
<p>The Third Match Abroad</p>
<p>Our team arrived in Singapore, and the fans happily told us that many gamblers were betting on us to win against the Singapore All-Stars by a margin of three goals. Using football matches for gambling is the most popular problem in the various regions of Southeast Asia. Sometimes the number of goals conceded is absurd and unreasonable, but the bad habit is too deeply ingrained in everyone, and fundamentally overthrowing the harm of gambling is as difficult as shaking Mount Tai. Football matches in Singapore usually start after 5:00 PM, so even though today is not a public holiday, there is still a huge crowd of spectators, over 20,000, breaking Singapore's record. The Singapore football field has lush green grass and is well maintained. It is built with crushed stones underneath, so the drainage is very fast. Even in heavy rain, it dries quickly and there is no problem of mud. In my decade or more of traveling around, Singapore's football field can be considered one of the best in East Asia. It is only regrettable that it is too small. About 20,000 spectators have already surrounded the field so tightly that there is no room to stand. We arrived at the field at 4:45, and the applause of welcome was deafening. After going on the field for photos, and trying out shots, the representatives of Nanyang Girls' High School presented flower baskets and fruits. After choosing sides, both teams lined up to await the whistle. The result was 4-0, with a score of 1-0 at halftime. The contributors were Jinshun, Huitang, Youliang, and Jingxiang, each one. Our lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Chen Zhenhe, Xu Yahui, Liang Rongzhao, Ye Beihua, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>As the ball moved, the Singapore side pressed hard on the right, but fortunately, the small black Tan Tongtou defended effectively, preventing any trouble. Our team counterattacked, using short passes, but also failed to score. After ten minutes of play, it suddenly started raining, and the ball became slippery, making it very difficult to control. It wasn't until the 25th minute that Comrade Jinshun scored first, and the cheers were deafening. The first half ended with only one goal lead. After sucking on lemons, the weather cleared up again, and our team's brilliance was revealed, with reporters Youliang and Jingxiang scoring three goals in a row, creating a 4-0 score. The fans were all beaming and happily went home. In this game, the performance in the first half was not revealed due to the rain, and the brilliance was only seen in the second half. The performance of each player was quite regular. Since becoming ill in Shanghai, my knees have been weak. After more than ten days of recuperation, I have gradually recovered. In today's game, running, dribbling, and shooting were quite foot-to-heart, restoring my old form, which can be considered comforting to the fans. Youliang is facing a major opponent for the first time, and his sprints are extremely fast, which is also commendable. Given time and training, he will be a great talent. Many of the old players of Singapore All-Stars have retired, and their strength is weaker than before. If it weren't for the rain, the number of goals conceded might have been even more. Lin Ziquan, the left center back, is as brilliant as ever, and his performance is outstanding. It is a pity that he cannot return to China to participate in the preliminaries due to work, which has forced the team to give up on a gem. This can also be considered unfortunate for the team. At the end of the match, the audience set off firecrackers, and the sound reverberated far and wide. Most of them had bet and won, and were happy to see the national team win, which is not surprising.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Today's Youth Association  Hosting an Indoor Sports Meet  Only Qingzhong and McLennan Schools are Participating, as Nationals Have Not Yet Universally Embraced this Sport <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Youth Athletic Department, with the aim of promoting indoor sports, is hosting a special indoor sports competition, scheduled for 4:30 PM today at the Association's gymnasium on Sichuan Road. However, indoor sports in our country, with the exception of basketball and volleyball, have not become widespread, resulting in few applicants for this competition. Currently, only Qingzhong Middle School and McLennan School are participating, with a total of approximately thirty athletes. According to Ling Xitao yesterday, indoor sports are extremely popular among Westerners, becoming a kind of game known to almost every household. The Youth Association has also held these events before, but they have been discontinued until now, after a lapse of more than ten years. I now feel that it is necessary to promote them again, so I have specifically reorganized them, hoping to popularize them. The items for today and the scoring methods are listed below:</p>
<p>Today's Order</p>
<p>Race  120-yard race with bells. At a distance of ten yards from the starting line, two wooden boxes are placed, level with the waist. In the box at the starting line, there are six pieces of cassava. The athlete must hold one piece of cassava in hand at the starting point, standing behind the starting line. Upon the command to start, the athlete runs forward, circles the wooden box ahead, places the cassava in the box, runs back around the starting line box, and takes the second piece of cassava. This continues until all six pieces of cassava are placed in the front box and the athlete runs back to the starting line to finish. One person will time the race, and the athlete with the shortest time will receive the highest score.</p>
<p>Pull-ups  Pull-ups are performed on a single bar. The athlete grips the bar, the body is vertical, and the feet are off the ground. Upon the command, the athlete bends both elbows, pulling the body up until the chin is above the bar. Then, the athlete straightens both elbows, returning the body to a vertical position, which counts as one repetition. This is repeated continuously. The body must remain vertical during the performance, and the legs must not be used for momentum to assist the body's ascent. If the chin does not clear the bar, it does not count. The athlete with the most repetitions receives the highest score.</p>
<p>Long Jump  Standing long jump. Place a wooden board four inches high off the ground, close to the wall. The athlete stands on the edge of the board, using the toes and the front of the foot to push off the edge of the board, jumping forward. Each person is allowed three attempts, and the longest jump is counted for scoring. If the athlete jumps off the side of the board, it is counted as one attempt.</p>
<p>Shot Put  Throwing a twelve-pound shot put. All rules are executed according to nationally promulgated regulations.</p>
<p>High Jump  Running high jump. The starting height is three feet, and the height is increased each time, with three attempts at each height. Other high jump rules are executed according to nationally promulgated regulations.</p>
<p>Basketball Throw  Basketball throw. The athlete stands with the ball at any spot under the basket, with one minute as the time limit. Upon the command, the athlete begins throwing the ball, and the athlete with the most throws in scores the highest.</p>
<p>Scoring Methods</p>
<p>Race  40 seconds is zero points. Each additional second deducts two points, and each second less adds two points (half a second or more is counted as one second).</p>
<p>Pull-ups  Four repetitions are zero points. Each additional repetition adds one point, and each repetition less deducts one point.</p>
<p>Long Jump  Six feet is zero points. Each additional two inches adds one point, and each two inches less deducts one point (more than one inch but less than two inches is calculated as two inches).</p>
<p>Shot Put  Throwing twenty feet is zero points. Each additional half foot adds one point, and each half foot less deducts one point (more than half the distance is considered a half foot).</p>
<p>High Jump  Four feet is zero points. Each additional inch adds one point, and each inch less deducts one point (more than half an inch is counted as one inch).</p>
<p>Basketball Throw  With a time limit of one minute, twenty throws are zero points. Each additional throw adds one point, and each throw less deducts one point.</p>
<p>Awards  The top ten athletes with the most total points will each receive a medal. The school with the most points will receive a flag.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Two Red Peaches (Part 1) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Having lived in Shanghai for more than a decade, I have never suffered any serious illnesses. However, I suddenly fell ill these past few days; my body temperature exceeded 40 degrees Celsius for a full week. Indeed, for someone who usually prides himself on his health, this is a rare and memorable illness.</p>
<p>Yes, a rare illness deserves to be commemorated with some writing. This short essay, "Two Red Peaches," can be considered a souvenir of this illness.</p>
<p>The title is "Two Red Peaches," but please, dear readers, do not misunderstand and think of them as two sweet, delicious, and flavorful peaches. These are neither Shandong Feicheng peaches, nor Fenghua honey peaches, nor Shanghai Longhua pan peaches. The peach in "Two Red Peaches" refers to a gland in the human body. Its name, when spoken, is quite familiar to everyone, called the "tonsils." — Tonsils, isn't that a very familiar term? These tonsils are located on both sides of the throat in our mouths, one on the left and one on the right, not at all lonely. So, why is there a "red" character above the "peach" in tonsils? This is easy to understand: because when these peaches get sick, they become red, swollen, ... a change due to illness. When real honey peaches and Feicheng peaches turn red, it indicates their ripeness and deliciousness; but when the tonsils turn red, it indicates that they are poisoned, in trouble, and exhibiting the symptoms of illness. In medicine, this inflamed and swollen state of the tonsils is called "tonsillitis." In pathology, the character "炎" (inflammation) inherently means red and swollen when looked at, and painful and hot when touched. Therefore, writing tonsillitis as "red peaches" naturally includes swelling, pain, and heat in addition to redness. Furthermore, in the human body, other than tonsillitis, all other organs and tissues that use the character "炎" contain the same meaning: indicating that this organ or tissue exhibits the four phenomena of redness, swelling, pain, and heat.</p>
<p>So, what is the use of these tonsils in the throat during normal days?</p>
<p>I say: these two peaches in the throat are a pair of gatekeepers and patrolmen in the human body. The throat in the mouth is like the main gate of the body, and the tonsils standing on the left and right of this main gate are just like a pair of gatekeepers and patrolmen. Their function is entirely the work of gatekeepers and patrolmen: everything that is drunk or eaten must first pass their examination and inquiry. For example, if they encounter toxins such as bacteria that are harmful to the human body, they will first rise up in protest, resist and fight against them, and prevent them from breaking into the body. When you see them become inflamed and "reddened" and swollen, that is proof that they are resisting foreign enemies, killing bacteria, and rejecting toxins. In terms of their shape, they are not usually round and protruding outwards like peaches; instead, they are flat and inconspicuous, without a peach-like shape that is visible. This is the case for most people. However, during childhood, the tonsils are significantly larger than in adults: after adulthood, they gradually flatten and disappear. However, in some people, they do not disappear even in adulthood, remaining as prominent as two small halves of peaches, just like in childhood. It is said that the tonsils of these people are more prone to problems and are easily infected by external bacteria and toxins. It seems that the two gatekeepers and patrolmen in the mouths of these people are too fiery and naturally belligerent, so they want to fight the enemy at every turn! Therefore, some people advocate removing these overgrown tonsils to reduce various accidental infections. However, the theory is such, and the reality is difficult to determine: the American medical community had previously conducted such an experiment, but did not obtain satisfactory results. They divided a large group of children into two teams, A and B, and completely removed the tonsils of the children in team A, while leaving them in team B. In the end, there was no significant difference in the chances of getting sick between the two teams; that is, the children in team A whose tonsils had been completely removed did not have fewer illnesses than team B. This shows that the chance of getting sick seems to have little to do with the presence or absence of the two small tonsils in the throat. Therefore, I think: the main factor in the chance of getting sick depends on the strength or weakness of each person's constitution! The relationship with the two tonsils in the throat is still weak.</p>
<p>With the explanation of the title over, let's now turn to the main text and talk about my illness.</p>
<p>The illness I have been suffering from for six or seven days is nothing serious; it is just the "two red peaches" mentioned in my title, which is the medical term "tonsillitis."</p>
<p>How did the peaches in my throat turn red? How did my tonsils become inflamed? Now let me tell you a brief account of what happened.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 8th of this month—a Friday—I accepted a friend's invitation to see the play "Thunderstorm" at the Carlton Theatre. By the time I returned to the hospital after the play, it was already one o'clock in the morning, and I felt quite tired. Then, because of the nursing school homework for the next morning, I wrote some lecture notes in the silent night. By the time I finished and went to sleep, it was already after two o'clock. When I got up the next day, I not only felt tired but also felt dizzy, had a headache, felt weak in my limbs, and had mild aches in my joints; however, my appetite was normal, and I had no fever or chills. At the time, I thought: I was probably just a little cold from staying up late last night, and I would be fine after resting. So, I勉强 taught my class in the morning. After resting for a day and a night, I fully expected that it would be better or at least improve the next day; however, the opposite was true: by the next day, Sunday, the dizziness, headache, fatigue in my limbs, general weakness, and general discomfort had become even more severe. It was only then that I thought: there must be something infectious in my body. My body temperature that day rose from 37.2 degrees to 37.5 degrees. At this time, symptoms in my throat also appeared: I felt that both tonsils on the left and right were red, swollen, burning, and painful; the appearance of "red peaches" was clearly revealed. Although my appetite was normal, it decreased, and my food intake naturally decreased. So, from that day on, I went to bed to rest and wait and see what would happen.</p>
<p>However, this was still the brewing period, close to the outbreak but not yet at the outbreak timing.</p>
<p>The next day, the outbreak period arrived. The first sign you saw was the body temperature rising sharply: from 28.5 degrees to 29.5 degrees; and by the evening, it actually reached 40 degrees. This lasted for eight hours, and only by the next morning did it drop by about 1.5 degrees, but it did not completely subside, and by the afternoon, it rose again, and the degree of the rise was even greater than the first day: the highest point actually broke the 40-degree mark! By the next morning, it still dropped, but it did not drop completely. The body temperature rose and fell repeatedly in this way; that is, it rose directly to 40 degrees or even exceeded 40 degrees every day, and when it dropped, it was around 38 degrees: this lasted for three consecutive days.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the high temperature of last night suddenly泻千里, retreated far below normal temperature, and was never seen to rise again. This was the period when the illness was approaching recovery and ending, which was also the period when the "two pairs of red peaches" were about to disappear and return to their place.</p>
<h3 id="e183">A Global View of Tuberculosis Statistics (10) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Based on recent experiences and observations, contact transmission between tuberculous couples is not very widespread and not as fearful as one might imagine. According to Rowand, this is because those who marry are often past the most dangerous time and greatest susceptibility, so there is no particularly dangerous contagiousness between tuberculous couples. Furthermore, physical strength and resistance also play a significant role.</p>
<p>In families with tuberculous couples, the incidence of tuberculosis transmission and mortality is higher than in families with healthy couples. This is, of course, due to contact transmission. Barckat demonstrated that tuberculous families have seven times more transmission cases than ordinary families, and children's tuberculin reactions turn positive earlier, at 84%, with 88.4% of these children showing changes on X-rays. This reaction reaches 100% in children over ten years old in tuberculous families. According to German statistics, the increase in transmission risk is not the same for every family, with only one-third of families experiencing it.</p>
<p>British literature provides detailed records of bovine tuberculosis transmission. Griffith presented the following results at the Royal Conference regarding the relationship between bovine tuberculosis bacteria and human tuberculosis: Of 128 cases of glandular tuberculosis, 47.5% were bovine bacteria; of 541 cases of bone and joint tuberculosis, 8.7% were bovine bacteria; of 100 cases of meningitis, 19.0% were bovine bacteria; and of 275 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, 1.1% were bovine bacteria. At the same time, reports from England and Wales all demonstrate that bovine tuberculosis transmission to humans is due to milk consumption. Over 50% of childhood tuberculosis cases caused by bovine transmission are due to milk consumption, and 40% of dairy cows are infected with tuberculosis. On 格痕珊岛, anti-tuberculosis measures were implemented for tuberculous cows, reducing the incidence from 7.87% between 1910 and 1919 to 0.38% between 1924 and 1931. At the same time, the incidence of tuberculosis transmission in children under five years old decreased from 8.5% to 7.2%. Recently, the United States and Spain have also published relevant literature on bovine tuberculosis. What we should pay attention to, according to experts, is that most milk transmission occurs through the esophagus, which should be given great importance in prevention.</p>
<p>The peak of mortality among elderly tuberculosis patients varies. According to Brian's international statistics, tuberculosis mortality is 9-10%, higher in Germany at 25%, and 65% in Saxony.</p>
<p>Finally, what we should pay particular attention to is that the "失业保险组织" (unemployment insurance organization) Invalidenversicherung's principal method is a major reason for reducing tuberculosis mortality, as this insurance organization is truly a base for anti-tuberculosis efforts. In 1931, there were 59 treatment institutions under the management of the insurance organization, treating 49,000 tuberculosis patients. The transmission of tuberculosis among the insured was reduced to 16%, and if viewed from the perspective of overall work, the effectiveness reached as high as 25%. From this, we can see that there is no other way to succeed in anti-tuberculosis efforts.</p>
<p>Conclusion Based on recent world literature and statistics, countries such as England and Germany have already reached the lowest peak of tuberculosis mortality, reducing it to only 7-8 deaths per 10,000 people. However, further reductions will not be achieved overnight. Other countries, such as France and Switzerland, have excellent anti-tuberculosis facilities, but still have higher tuberculosis mortality rates. As for the future trend of anti-tuberculosis efforts, judging from the current situation in Europe, tuberculosis transmission is still severe. Without considerable economic resources, its success in anti-tuberculosis efforts may still be difficult. As for why tuberculosis mortality is very high in some places and low in others, the only answer is the public health conditions and cultural circumstances. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e184">School Health Education (Part 1) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Lecture by Shao Xiangyi, Notes by Li Lingdong</p>
<p>—Lecture at the Jiangsu Provincial Capital Health Education Committee School Health Training Class—</p>
<p>The Scope of Health Education: For the sake of convenient implementation, it can be divided into public health education and school health education. Today, let's first talk about school health education. The entire target of school health education is elementary school students, but it is not impossible to discuss health education with middle school students and college students, nor is it unnecessary to study health education. This is because middle school students and college students have reached the stage of adolescence, their intellect and emotional awareness have opened, and they already pay attention to health issues. However, children are in the most valuable golden age of life, and the quality of daily life can affect the gains and losses of their entire future life. Therefore, elementary school health education is the foundation for establishing our health education.</p>
<p>The entire 20th century is the age of children. Children are the basic building blocks of the nation, the future masters of the country. If we want the country to be strong, we must make the national physique healthy, and we must start with children first, so that they have healthy bodies and minds and develop good hygiene habits. However, most family education in China is still lacking, life has not yet been standardized and legalized, and health education has not yet been paid attention to by the people. Therefore, health education has become an urgent and necessary trend today. Now, let's talk about the purpose, principles, methods, and content of health education separately below.</p>
<p>1.  The Purpose of Health Education</p>
<p>I. Instill Sanitary Knowledge Children are very difficult to understand the conditions of what is sanitary and what is unsuitable in all aspects of life, so we must first instill sanitary knowledge to children, again and again, so that their impressions deepen day by day, and then the action of unsuitable sanitation will gradually be corrected, so that children can enjoy health and happiness throughout their lives.</p>
<p>II. To Form Sanitary Habits After children have sanitary knowledge, they still need to base on knowledge-based methods and regulations, such as diet, daily life, sleep, defecation, exercise, brushing teeth, posture, work and rest, appliances, and body organ protection, public hygiene implementation, etc. Gradually train them to develop good habits. Cultivating good hygiene habits is not an ordinary easy task. Many people with adequate sanitary knowledge often have actions that are sometimes unsanitary due to their usual neglect, so it is not easy to develop habits. When we train children to develop hygiene habits, first build a solid foundation of sanitary knowledge, and then guide children to know and act, and correct their bad habits at any time and place, so that children remember hygiene creeds, and proceed according to the law every day without interruption or following the old ways, and over time, children's hygiene habits will naturally enter the right track. Arranging a good environment and facilities is also an important thing to promote children's good hygiene habits.</p>
<p>III. Arouse Children's Interest in Hygiene If we use a mechanical method to instill children's sanitary knowledge and make them develop sanitary habits, the result will inevitably be insignificant, so it is necessary to arouse children's interest in hygiene in advance. If children are interested in hygiene, they will automatically explore the road of hygiene. Arouse children's interest during implementation. We should focus more on the positive aspects, for example, for the cruel and fierce cholera disease, we should tell children not to eat raw food, unboiled water, rotten fruits, and inject cholera preventive needles. Although cholera disease is very similar to the harm of floods and beasts, we can also avoid its harm. If we only tell children from the negative aspects how high the mortality rate of cholera disease is, how fierce the epidemic situation is, and do not instruct children on the correct methods of cholera prevention, so that children have an interest in studying cholera, it will instead increase children's fear, so arouse children's interest in sanitation, in the implementation, more use of positive and less use of negative aspects.</p>
<p>2.  Principles for Implementation of Health Education</p>
<p>I. Use Interesting Teaching Materials and Methods For example, draw a thin person, and then put a piece of tofu next to it, and a healthy and strong person, explain to children the meaning of the picture, if the thin person often eats soy milk, it is possible to become a strong person, this kind of teaching materials and methods, is to imply the value of children to eat nutritious products.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Physician's Creed <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Song Bin</p>
<p>When the National Physicians Association held its fourth general meeting in Hankou this spring, it was resolved to formulate a national physician's creed. Recently, the specialized committee of the association, Zhang Senyu, Wu Jishun, Jiang Zhenxun, Zhu Hengbi, and Song Guobin, met, repeatedly discussed, and drafted ten articles, as follows:</p>
<p>Do not exaggerate advertisements or seek unjust wealth.</p>
<p>Do not refuse consultations without reason, and do not discriminate against the poor.</p>
<p>Do not perform abortions, overuse surgeries, or use new drugs and secret formulas excessively.</p>
<p>Do not issue incorrect medical certificates out of personal considerations.</p>
<p>Do not slander colleagues or engage in unethical competition.</p>
<p>Strictly guard medical confidentiality.</p>
<p>Join the physician's association in the place of practice and report any disputes to the association for handling.</p>
<p>Participate in rescue work during international wars.</p>
<p>Assist health agencies in reporting the epidemic of infectious diseases and guide the public in disinfection and isolation methods.</p>
<p>Assist poor patients and provide free medical care.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>

<h3 id="e187">Hygiene During the Plum Rain Season (Part 2) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>Therefore, during the plum rain season, attention must be paid to the development of molds and the prevention of flies. It is critical to consider methods for their removal in the early stages. Since it is difficult to prevent the proliferation of molds, it is even more difficult to have both favorable weather and geographical conditions during the plum rain season, as mentioned earlier regarding fungi. Generally speaking, one must strive to create conditions to prevent the development of molds. For example, keep the room temperature low and avoid moisture. Clothes, bedding, and other items should be exposed to sunlight on sunny days to dry them. Boxes, chests, and wardrobes should be opened to circulating air. Furthermore, food-containing waste, as mentioned earlier, contains sufficient nutrients for molds to multiply. Therefore, such waste must be thoroughly wiped away and removed. If the path of fungal development is discovered, disinfect thoroughly with mercuric chloride solution, carbolic acid, or other disinfectants. However, this method cannot be applied to food because disinfectants that kill molds also harm humans. Since the nutrients of molds are the same as human food, and the components of mold spores are also completely the same as humans, anything that can poison molds can also poison humans. The best way to handle food is to pass it through fire again. Boiling can kill common molds harmful to the human body. However, if food is severely damaged by molds, even if boiled, the fungus may die, but the toxic chemical substances produced by the fungus's decomposition will not necessarily become non-toxic. Furthermore, toxins within the fungal spores have strong resistance to heat. Even if the fungus is completely dead, poisoning can still occur from eating such food. It is best not to eat already spoiled food, even after boiling, and one must be careful to prevent it from spoiling. All perishable items are liked by molds, and what molds like is also what humans like. Humans like appropriate flavor and sweetness; molds like them too. However, excessively salty foods such as salted vegetables, and very sweet pastries and candied fruits are harmful to molds and generally do not breed them. Observe toothpicks inserted in white sugar or salt; they do not rot even after a long time. This is because white sugar and salt cannot be attached by mold, which makes the toothpicks disinfected. (The End)</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>The prohibition of kissing for patients, the prohibition of breastfeeding, the proper consideration of marriage and procreation, and attention to drinking milk; these few things can easily spread tuberculosis bacteria and favor the progression of the disease, and should be strictly noted in preventive guidelines.</p>
<p>Based on the principle of killing tuberculosis bacteria, the above-mentioned various preventive regulations are considered to be doing everything possible; but we dare not guarantee that we have completely prevented the spread of tuberculosis bacteria in the surrounding environment. This is unavoidable! Therefore, for patients with open cases of the disease, it is best to send them to a specialized sanatorium for isolation; this is the only best policy. This is entirely for the lifelong happiness of the patient's family and those close to them. To put it simply: it is for the entire society; it must not be regarded as "inhumane" or "callous."</p>
<p>Section 2: Active Prevention</p>
<p>As mentioned above, regarding the prevention policy of this disease, in addition to setting up methods to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria in society: everyone should develop a physique that can defend against tuberculosis bacteria even if they enter the body, which is what is now called "active prevention"! We know that the complete elimination of tuberculosis bacteria in society is difficult to achieve; therefore, various aspects of active prevention seem even more important than the former.</p>
<p>How can we increase the human body's defense against tuberculosis infection? In a nutshell, it is to use the greatest natural force! This is something that everyone in the human race can enjoy as much as possible! The applications included in this aspect are air, sunlight, and water. The details of this will now be described below:</p>

<p>Recently, Shanghai's financial market has received little attention due to the impact of tightened lending. Yesterday, banks seemed to believe that the news of the Sino-US trade agreement was about to materialize, and it was expected that there might be liquidity in the financial sector. The situation was slightly better, and the flow of goods in various businesses was also smoother, much better than before. The foreign call loan rate in the market has shown a good start, increasing by one point compared to the previous day, calculated as nine points. Early and midday bill trading did not increase much due to interbank credit relationships. It is estimated that the early market transferred over 2.8 million, with over 200,000 in new transactions. Midday transactions were over 100,000, and transactions in the Small General Assembly were 200,000 to 300,000. Banknotes issued locally were over 500,000, and over 300,000 to other locations.

<p>Yesterday, the government bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, as the last day of the month for futures trading, saw quite lively swapping of long and short positions. The trend was very chaotic, with buying and selling on the counter being extremely disordered. Signs of squeezing both long and short positions occurred several times. Large long positions saw a decrease in their ability to absorb due to the adverse environmental situation, and smuggling in North China worsened. Both sides actively swapped positions, and a small number of long positions took the opportunity to come out. The market price was seen to fall amidst the competition. Only June futures trading will be filmed today, and the trend of the market price will change according to changes in the environment. Yesterday morning, the opening saw very active swapping of short positions, and the market price unanimously fell. The price difference between near and far dates was particularly large. In the second round, No. 35 was sold very actively, and Nos. 16 and 4 were swapped. The market price fell more in the near future and less in the distant future, presenting a state of squeezing long positions, with a uniform decrease of 5 *fen* to 0.5 yuan. By the time the afternoon opened, there were long position swaps, including Nos. 11 and 4, and short position swaps including Nos. 54 and 16. Unified B and C saw a slight rebound of 1 to 2 *jiao*. At the closing, both sides continued to swap positions, especially the short side such as Nos. 54 and 16, which had the most swaps. The market price showed a squeezing short position again. The closing result was a uniform decrease of 5 *fen* to 0.55 yuan compared to the previous day, but Unified A for this month was good for 1 *jiao*. The total number of transactions was 9,390,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. As this month's yarn was the last day of business, although long positions worked hard to collect goods, the warehouses were full of yarn. The market trend turned sluggish in the afternoon, and the final price was $195, a decrease of $9.10 compared to last month's $204.10. The current yarn business sees relatively smooth purchases from the Yunnan *bang*, and the future will still be based on actual needs.</p>
<p>The Market for Standard Yarn Rose in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon. The standard yarn market opened in the morning with uniform price increases across all months, as long positions prepared to collect goods for this month. Sellers in the market were not eager, and the market situation tightened. The near-month price increase regained momentum. At the same time, there was news of activity from the southern Yunnan *bang* in the spot yarn market, and market sentiment was good. Prices in each month slowly rose. As a result, near-month prices were uniformly higher than the previous day's closing price by $1.20 to $1.30, and distant-month prices were higher by $0.46 to $0.47. The afternoon opening was still stable, with discrepancies of $0.03 to $0.03. There was still no change when the second round was filmed. By the time of the closing, this month was the last contest, and the short positions came on strong, shouting prices wildly down to $190, but there were very few hands reaching out in the market. The long positions did not move. Later, prices gradually rebounded to close at $195, but fell $9.10 compared to the end of last month. The distant months were pulled down, and the result was that this month fell $2.50 compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months fell $0.06 to $1.13 to $0.06. It was verified that Tongji sold 1,250 bales, Yutai sold 1,400 bales, Mingde sold 1,250 bales, Qingfeng sold 1,300 bales, Ruidai sold 850 bales, Senkang sold 1,500 bales, Taichang sold 1,900 bales, Yichang sold 900 bales, Xincheng sold 2,100 bales, Renfeng sold 700 bales, and Runkang sold 700 bales.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Turn Active</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are better, with the Yunnan *bang* making purchases strongly. It was verified that the total amount bought by various *bangs* throughout the day was 1,647, and the selling price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of each *bang* are listed below:</p>
<p>Shantou: 25, Yunnan: 1,050, Guangdong: 170, Inland: 35, Ningbo: 2, Anqing: 15, Tonghang: 40, Jiangxi: 50, Xuzhou: 10, Fujian: 5, Tianjin: 45, Weihaiwei: 20</p>

<p>The cotton market initially trended firmly in the morning. As the last day of business for the current month, although there were tens of thousands of *dan* of deliveries, including 20,000 *dan* of fine cotton that were accepted by Japanese merchants, there were more *babu* operators, and market prices rose. In the afternoon, due to the sluggishness of the yarn market, floating longs spit out their holdings, and the downward trend was slightly more intense at the end of the day, closing at $42, a decrease of $3 compared to $45 last month. In short, there is still no solution for coarse cotton.</p>
<p>The Market for Standard Cotton Increased in the Distant Future and Recently Decreased</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, and there were 20,000 *dan* of fine cotton this month that were *babu* and not delivered. Moreover, it was rumored in the market that prices would reach $3, and the opening price for the month jumped by 0.3 *jiao*, with distant months following suit, and market sentiment became increasingly tight. As a result, the prices for each month were uniformly higher than the previous day's closing price by 0.3 to 0.45 *jiao*. The afternoon opening saw stable prices for this month, rising another 0.15 *jiao*, while distant months rose by 0.05 to 0.1 *jiao*. However, at the opening of the second round, there was no movement this month, and the momentum in the distant future turned soft, falling by 0.15 *jiao*. By the third closing, the market was affected by the sharp fall in the yarn market, and the price for the month plunged by 0.5 *jiao*. Pressure from the sellers was intense, and they were shouting wildly down to $40.04. Subsequently, short positions actively offset, recovering to close at $42. As a result, the price for this month fell by 0.6 *jiao* compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months fell by 0.2 to 0.25 *jiao*. It was verified that Yongchang sold 1,800 *dan*, Dachang sold 1,600 *dan*, Runkang sold 1,000 *dan*, Taichang sold 2,400 *dan*, Jifeng sold 2,200 *dan*, Meiji sold 2,100 *dan*, Qingfeng sold 2,300 *dan*, Changfeng sold 13,100 *dan*, Changhe sold 4,700 *dan*, Ruiyuan sold 3,000 *dan*, Dafeng sold 1,800 *dan*, Daji sold 1,700 *dan*, and Yuanxingchang sold 2,000 *dan*.

<p>Yesterday, the rise and fall of yarn and cotton was still slight, and cotton cloth was not much affected. The market situation was calm, and most of the selling plates did not change. Tianjin's East goods, fine cloth, serge, and other goods had not been moved for a long time. The inventory was empty. Yesterday, 140 to 150 packages of Yufeng Factory's 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth and 50 cases of Neiwaifang's Four Gentlemen serge were moved. This factory's Qingfeng Meihang and other factories' plain-colored *fu chou* were also moved in quantities of 20 to 30 cases. The selling plates were as usual. 60 to 70 packages of Qingfeng's 16-pound Double Fish coarse cloth were packed. The Guang *bang* imported some lower-grade fine cloth, over 50 packages of fine twill, and over 100 packages. The local dye factories imported over 100 pieces of Wufuji detailed cloth, Longtou fine cloth, and other goods. Wufuji details were in great demand by the local customer *bangs*, and there was a large shortage of spot goods, it was said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the woolen summer goods such as white serge, white straight tribute, *paikaishi*, *fanliding*, gauze linen glue cloth, yellow tea green *kagan*, feather yarn *ni*, etc. from the Public Welfare Association all had good trends. The Western clothing shops of the customer *bang* all made purchases in succession. The sales of white serge and white straight tribute were even better, and the selling prices were particularly firm, because both Eastern and Western goods were out of stock. White glue cloth with the Old Knife and Scissors brand was the firmest. The *paikaishi* from both Eastern and Western goods were all strong, and the *fanliding* was also mostly strong due to cost reasons, it was said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was generally calm after opening in the morning, but later distant futures turned stable. Foreign wheat quotations from Chicago fell by 0.2 to 0.6 *jiao*, while Canadian wheat fell by 0.2 *jiao*. At the time of the opening price, the current month initially opened at 0.9 *jiao*, later rising to 0.915 *jiao*, but then the long positions returned, and the market gradually weakened again. The distant futures in each month turned more stable because the rain did not stop and the weather was cool. Although the new wheat has not yet been harvested, the rain is ultimately not suitable, so market sentiment turned stable. When the afternoon opened, June was still sluggish due to inactive buying, and the distant futures in each month continued to compensate because time did not stop, so each month turned out to be better than expected. Only June was less than 0.02 *jiao*. The situation thereafter will still depend on the sunny or rainy weather.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after opening in the morning, saw a steady upward trend in all months. Although foreign wheat quotations fell by two or three cents, the weather in recent days, alternating between sunshine and rain, threatened to affect the new wheat harvest. Therefore, market participants were bullish, with opening prices for all months rising by five, six, or seven cents. Later, due to profit-taking by bulls, the market weakened slightly. By the afternoon opening, trading in all months had quieted down, but the market sentiment gradually turned firmer, mainly due to the continuing rain, which caught the attention of many. Currently, the wheat market remains soft, falling three to five cents from the previous week's closing price. For example, Shandong Yaowan wheat opened at only four dollars and thirty cents, with an estimated 500 bags, reportedly purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice had decreased because after the Shanghai price declined, it became difficult to transport from various places. Only medium and lower-quality rice and rice that had overheated were rushed to Shanghai for sale. Medium and lower-quality Jiangxi rice had been sold off at depreciated prices for several days. However, after the price reduction of medium and lower-quality rice and overheated rice, it gained brisk sales from Ningbo and Shaoxing merchants, and the local market also became active. Yesterday, the Ningbo merchants' demand was even stronger, with over 5,000 bags of medium and lower-quality Jiangxi rice targeted. Local merchants followed closely, and transactions reached over 10,000 bags, raising the market price by five cents. Other types of rice also followed suit. 633 bags of Xiang oil rice were offered, along with 300 bags of Taizhou, Nanjing, and Jiangbei rice. Total transactions amounted to around 12,000 bags. Apart from Ningbo merchants inquiring about Jiangxi rice, the rest was purchased by local merchants.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, shipments from various sources totaled 17 or 18, amounting to 1,200 to 1,300 shi. Due to the continuous rain, people were slightly more confident, but sales remained sluggish. Only 700 to 800 bags of baozi rice were sold to merchants from Beiyang. Therefore, the market situation was sufficient, with no significant price differences between thick and thin japonica rice. Du Yangjian rice and Yuan rice remained average.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 14 or 15 ships arrived from He Xia. The sales of white japonica rice in the market were acceptable despite the overcast and rainy weather. The price was firm. Medium-quality rice was discounted by several cents. Thin-skinned rice was firm. Sales of Yuan rice and Yangjian Du Ke Xian rice were balanced. The market was stable. Lingwei Fu Xian rice became more active, and the price was tight by six or seven cents. The prices of other goods were also firm.</p>

<p>This year, new broad beans are appearing later due to weather conditions (last year, Wenzhou goods were seen on the market as early as May 12th). Therefore, Dongyang merchants first ordered 400 tons of Sha broad beans at a price of four dollars and five cents, all in accordance with foreign firm regulations. New rapeseed has also not been seen on the market. Since futures were offered at eight dollars, there has been no market for many days. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese market has fallen, but the local market is trending tighter due to the rainy weather. Therefore, buyers and sellers are holding firm, and transactions have not opened yet.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the New York market was closed. Due to falling prices in Yokohama, overseas silk markets were affected, but local manufacturers were unwilling to lower prices. Therefore, transactions by foreign firms returned to silence. Manufacturers believe that due to the continuous rain in recent days, cocoon harvests cannot be entirely optimistic, so they are unwilling to sell easily.</p>

<p>The No. 120 "Sky Bridge" brand artificial silk price remained unchanged at around 360 yuan. Transactions were slightly clearer because the accumulation by hoarders was fixed, but after several days of brisk sales, the inventory was extremely dry. Private goods were sold out. Customs labeled only ten odd boxes. Once this cargo is sold out, formal foreign firm transactions can begin. The current listed price is 130 yuan without tax and 420 yuan with tax. No. 100 matte silk and No. 25300 glossy silk are about to be sold out. The price of artificial silk has been rising daily in the past week, but woven products have seen downstream declines. Therefore, silk weaving factories are unable to make a profit.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market situation was still uneven. Core-extracted Zhen Mei green tea from both "Lu Zhuang" and "Tu Zhuang" was still in demand in Africa, and the price was still stable. Ordinary Zhuang Zhen Mei's market remained weak. Yesterday, over two hundred boxes of Lu Zhuang Tunxi Zhen Mei arrived. Tongfu purchased thirty-nine boxes at 135 yuan. Zhen Mei Baitou was purchased by the trade at a fixed price of 102 yuan. There were no other significant transactions. Suan Zhen Mei also continued to arrive. Apart from Tongfu purchasing Tailong at 82 yuan, transactions were quiet. Dute and Xiehe jointly purchased over a hundred boxes of Tu Zhuang Zhen Mei, ranging from 68 yuan to 77 yuan. Although market transactions were few yesterday, the price was still able to hold. For Ping Shui pearl tea, Yihe, Yongxing, and other firms followed suit, with a total of over three hundred pieces transacted, priced from 55.5 yuan to 99 yuan. The market was slightly softer than before. Zhen Mei of this type, with good strips and soup, was still traded, priced at 33 yuan to 39 yuan. As for Qimen black tea, although many firms inquired and asked for prices after being listed on Saturday, due to the large quantity, tasting took a long time, and new trading had not yet begun.</p>

Jian merchants offered dozens of bags of assorted white sugar, from 17 yuan to 15 yuan ban. Xinghua merchants imported dozens of bags of Da Gong fen bai, 17 yuan ban, rising by 4 jiao.</p>

<p>Pickled Mustard Tuber: The market price of new Sichuan pickled mustard tuber has reached a peak in the past week. Yesterday, Fuling vegetables were also offered, with a total of 400 urns transacted. The tight trend has not diminished. For example, the Gonghexing brand opened at 25 yuan ban, the same price as Gaofengdu vegetables. Secondary Fuling vegetables were 23 yuan ban. Xie Mao purchased more Huai this time. Taiji Fuling vegetables insisted on 26 yuan and did not open. According to industry insiders, the market will remain tight, and high-quality goods may reach 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Black Fungus: Due to sluggish sales recently, the market price has not fluctuated much. According to Hankou telegraph, over fifty packages of Nanzhang fungus arrived, newly harvested, opening at 90 yuan. 22 packages of Yichang fungus arrived in Shanghai, with only one or two tenths being new goods, opening at 92 yuan. Therefore, the price difference from old goods is not significant. The market price will require waiting for the arrival of formally new goods to get an accurate price quote.</p>

<p>(New Shrimp Roe): According to news from various ports in Jiangbei, the three tides have not been productive recently due to the lack of warm weather, resulting in poor harvests. The local port has few incoming goods, so the market is able to stand still. The current selling price for genuine natural dried goods is 140 yuan, and for colored and moistened goods, it is 130 yuan to 120 yuan. The future depends on the abundance of catches in the producing areas and the market's prosperity and decline.</p>
<p>(New Crab Roe): Yesterday, the first batch of eight bags arrived, totaling approximately 600 odd jin, selling for 75 yuan. Demand was brisk, with local and Hankou merchants purchasing the entire quantity.</p>
<p>(New Sea Swallow): Yesterday, three pieces of fine strips from Wenzhou, approximately 200 odd jin, sold for 57 yuan 5 jiao. However, the goods were damp and of poor quality. Fortunately, it was a time of shortage and the first batch of new arrivals. Shops purchased some to show off new items, so although the goods were of secondary quality, there were still many customers. Also, the quantity arrived was limited, so it sold out quickly. Few East Ocean goods were also in the market, peddled on the market. Medium strips were priced at 56 to 57 yuan. Coarse and fine grades are currently out of stock. Weihaiwei goods were sold previously at 53 yuan and are now sold out, but new goods have already appeared. In the future, sources from various producing areas will inevitably increase gradually, so the market price should prevent a decline.</p>

<p>200-pound American tinplate has been in strong demand by egg factories today, with as many as four or five hundred boxes being offered in recent days, and there are still many people buying, so tinplate can be said to be the only one that is popular among the various colors. However, the selling price is lower than before by one or two yuan due to the eagerness of the same industry to sell, and the market price is lower than before. For example, the first-class goods of the official brand (with iron shell) are sold at 48 yuan, the second-class goods are sold at 45 yuan, and the third-class goods are sold at 44 yuan. The first-class goods of the auxiliary brand (without iron shell) are opened at 44 yuan, the second-class goods are sold at 43 yuan, and the third-class goods are opened at 42 yuan and 5 jiao. It is found that a total of 350 boxes were approved for sale in the past two days, which were sold by a certain nine gold shop in North Suzhou Road and purchased by egg factories such as Peilin and Maochang.

<p>Time and space are like the latitude and longitude of the universe. Our small and short lives in this nature make us always regard the universe as mysterious. However, we who live in the 24th century, look at all the existing things in this universe. Aren't they all inventions left by our ancestors? In a short life, a great career can be created. "Time is our warhorse." This sentence can be our motto.</p>
<p>Humans are lazy animals, and also full of desires. If you don't need anything, then you won't do anything. When many people are determined to do something, there is often this question: "When to start?" I believe the most common answer is of course the two words "tomorrow". However, tomorrow is a very strange thing, a treasure that is used every day. As a result, many brilliant and great undertakings of mankind in society can be ruined by these two words "tomorrow".</p>

<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>Being poor and fond of traveling, I calculate the travel expenses and end up owing debts for drinks. Knowing that this is not a necessary thing, yet indulging in it without fatigue, I secretly laugh at myself. However, in the past ten years, the income from my labor has only barely allowed me to wander within two thousand li, and I regret that I am not as good as the wandering monks. Whatever I usually see that is enough to dazzle my eyes, I pick up and record as a small chronicle, keeping a record of the reasons, and being very strict about mountains and rivers. If I cannot fully express the meaning, I must also sing and praise it. If there are extremely wonderful and subtle places that can be understood in the heart but cannot be expressed in words, then I must sit in meditation day and night and savor them carefully. If it is not enough, I will even transform them into clear dreams and review them repeatedly. Having indulged in this for a long time, whenever I finish tea and wine, by the lamp or under the pillow, what I vaguely connect to all around me is nothing but the light of streams and the shadows of mists. Sometimes when encountering setbacks, I immediately check a certain mountain and a certain river and travel there in my mind, and my thoughts are opened up and I feel comfortable. Therefore, I boast that what I have gained within two thousand li cannot be said to be not substantial; and that the resources I have spent in a continuous stream, are they in vain? However, my family does not understand. They repeatedly stop my travels, but when I tempt them with what I have enjoyed, they are always fascinated; because the words I weave from my tongue are taken from the elite of mountains, rivers, and people. Every laugh, every smile, every grass, and every tree, is better than listening to storytellers in the streets tell stories about Cai Zhonglang.</p>
<p>The water of Zhuji originates from Wu Xie in the upper reaches and connects to Puyang in the lower reaches. The sound of the beach hitting and colliding is cold all year round. Where it converges outside the South City, the banks are green and the sand is white, truly clear and lovely, called the Huansha Stream, where Xizi used to cast her shadow. Beside the stream is a small hill, densely covered with bamboo and trees that can be embraced by four people, called the Luoluo Village. A secluded path separates it from human habitation. At the end, there are several shrine halls, enshrining the statue of Xishi, wearing a black crown and a golden lattice dress. It was decorated by a Chen surname person from the town. "Laughing with the Lord and crying behind his back," thinking of the difficult situation back then, how extreme is the sigh! I regret that today's country does not need beautiful women. A beautiful image in the shrine is not enough to inspire passion. The East wing displays Xishi's account of descending to earth, written in the first person, which says: "My appearance is not very beautiful, but my face is round and red. I do not apply powder, yet my radiance is naturally bright." This is quite novel. In the West wing lives a middle-aged nun, with five or six young nuns. She is supervising them to sit in meditation, learning to play cymbals and chant Buddhist scriptures. When they cannot do it well, she beats them. Their sobbing and crying fill the courtyard. Looking back at the round red statue, smiling brightly, the joys and sorrows before my eyes, are just like this. Why do we need to prove it in the six realms? Outside the shrine, the original field is planted with vegetables, which are covered with morning dew, crystal clear and lovely. The leaves of the tall glossy black oak trees are red, and the clay figures are simple, as if they are where the souls of people are attached. Floating on the stream, there are bamboo rafts and seagulls. Appearing and disappearing in the vastness, there are the changes of mountain travelers wearing cloud robes. All that is missing is a daughter on the stone washing yarn.</p>

<p>— Shi Jiu</p>
<p>For houses that are deep, the front door has to be kept closed to prevent thieves from entering. Also, for fear that visitors might find that nine out of ten knocks go unanswered, the homeowner installs a doorbell. Inside, a bell is hung and led by a rope to the outside of the front door. A copper or iron ring is attached to the end of the rope. In this way, people outside the door can save themselves the trouble of knocking. Just pull the ring hard, and naturally the bell inside will ring and report that someone is coming. Recently, there are electric doorbells, which are even more convenient, requiring only the trouble of pressing a finger.</p>
<p>It is not easy to determine when doorbells began, but there were doorbells in government offices in the Tang Dynasty. Zheng Qi's poem: "The tassel bell is silent, the pearl palace is closed." "Tassel bell" is the doorbell. Han Wei also has a poem that says: "Sitting for a long time, I suddenly heard the rope of the bell move, and the sound of Ding Chi rang to the west of the Jade Hall." "Jade Hall" is the Hanlin Academy; based on this to prove Zheng's poem, then "Pearl Palace" also refers to the Hanlin Academy. According to the Hanlin Academy, it was the place where the inner court was provided for. Emperor Xuanzong established the Academy of Scholars separately, and later it also assumed the title of Hanlin, and became the Hanlin Scholar, serving directly in the Forbidden Court, specializing in drafting edicts. "Pearl Palace." "Jade Hall" are nothing more than metaphors for the lofty status of the Hanlin Academy.</p>
<p>Drafting edicts is the emperor's decree; in other words, the Hanlin Academy is the agency that drafts national decrees, so it should be very strict, especially since it is close to the Forbidden Court. Installing a doorbell is to show that the Han Academy is an important place, and idlers should not enter. Li Deyu said: "The Hanlin Academy has a bell to prepare for urgent texts, which is pulled to replace shouting. According to the Tang system: the Forbidden Court is strict, and people who are not from this academy, even if they have official business, do not dare to enter the interior; the inner officials who announce things must also pull the bell first. Whenever there are documents, the inner officials stand outside the door; when the bell rings, the small judge of the academy goes out to receive them, gives them to the academy envoy, and the academy envoy gives them to the scholar." Tasting the words of the three families of Zheng, Han, and Li, the doorbell installed in the Hanlin Academy at that time was probably the same as the rope bell installed today.</p>
<p>Nowadays, each agency office is either equipped with a calling bell or a conversation machine, which is more convenient than the Tang Dynasty's use of bells to replace calling.</p>

<p>Next to Longhua Temple, there is a "Blood Flower" memorial temple, which is used to commemorate the fallen generals. There are four small pavilions built there, storing square memorial monuments, with the front engraved: "The surnames of the fallen generals of the 32nd Division of the National Revolutionary Army". The rest are all engraved with the surnames of the generals. Perhaps it is the government's desire to encourage the people! So it is open day and night, and anyone can go in and visit; and some trees and flowers are planted, which are even more popular with tourists in the spring and autumn. However, the people of our country have never paid attention to morality. In addition to recreation, they leave some big characters on the memorial monument, the so-called "XXX visited here", which fills every memorial monument, and the surnames of those generals have been buried and cannot be identified.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have even come up with the idea of writing five calligraphy characters in the middle of the monument: "Please leave your name". I thought to myself, the person who wrote it is either a master of humor or a comedian expert.</p>

<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>Bouncing opera star Zhu Baoxia is the record holder for opening Shanghai bouncing opera and is a great contributor to giving bouncing opera a superior position in Shanghai. After stopping performing at the New World Hotel and Little Guanghan, she went to the Northeast, Qingdao, and Nanjing. Because of her exquisite art, she was welcomed everywhere. It is said that Shanghai people have been away for a year. This decision to come to Shanghai again to perform at the Golden Theater caused a sensation in Shanghai. However, due to the theater's relationship, she stopped performing in less than ten days, which greatly disappointed the audience who welcomed Zhu Baoxia. Later, she performed at the Rongjin Grand Theater for a period of seven days. After seven days, she performed at the Great World for a long time. This is naturally great news for people who love Zhu Baoxia's art. The day before yesterday, someone talked about Zhu Baoxia's life and art, which was very interesting. Now it is recorded below.</p>
<p>Zhu Baoxia's father, named Juxian, is a bouncing opera family with a great reputation in the North. Now he is over sixty years old. He decided to come to Shanghai with Zhu Baoxia. Zhu's bouncing opera art is all due to family tradition. She started learning bouncing opera at the age of six. At this time, Bai Yushuang was fourteen years old and also learned opera from Juxian, so Bai Yushuang and Zhu Baoxia are still called senior sisters.</p>
<p>The most difficult point in learning bouncing opera is crying on the spot in bitter operas. Zhu Baoxia put in a lot of hard work when she was learning. She often lit an incense stick in a dark place, opened her eyes wide, and stared at the incense fire, until her eyes were sore and she shed tears. This kind of practice did not stop, and naturally she could reach the point where she could shed tears immediately. Zhu Baoxia's operas such as "Poor Girl's Tears", "Sawing a Bowl and Nailing It", and "Yang Sanjie's Accusation" can make people feel moved and shed tears like rain. Bai Yushuang has not practiced this skill, so she is not suitable for performing this kind of touching bitter opera.</p>
<p>Zhu Baoxia started singing opera on stage at the age of eleven. When she was fifteen, her charming appearance and graceful charm were noticed by General Long Legs. At this time, the warlords were so powerful that Zhu Baoxia was occupied by Zhang under the force of arms. At this time, she was not called Baoxia, but Xiaobao. This was in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, when Zhang Zongchang was fleeing the country, his concubines were mostly scattered, each going their own way. Zhu Baoxia was naturally one of them. However, because Zhu's return to Zhang was too short, she could not get a huge amount of money like Ya Xian, so after coming out, she had to reorganize her old business and make a living by performing bouncing opera. Fortunately, her art has not become unfamiliar, but has become more and more advanced due to her efforts during the rest period. In addition to her charming expression and beautiful appearance, as soon as she appeared on stage, she caused a sensation in North China and became a famous bouncing opera star.</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems that Zhu Baoxia and Bai Yushuang are in an opposing position, but in reality it is not so. The friendship between Zhu and Bai is very strong. They often play together. Even when Zhu was performing in Pudong, Bai Yushuang specially crossed the river to visit Zhu. The friendship between the two can be imagined.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Fragrant grass, beautiful woman, gentle waves gently supporting,</p>
<p>Moonlit night in the small building, good dreams begin warmly.</p>
<p>Guoqi said: "I don't mean anything, I just want to see it first. Goodbye, goodbye." After saying these words, he really went home. After dinner, he had to sit under the lamp and read a few pages of a book. But today his mind was a little flustered. As soon as he sat down, the image of the girl he met under the apricot blossoms floated into his mind. He felt that the girl's face was a bit like Venus, so when he paid attention to the Venus on the table, she seemed to show a full face of smiles and look at him. So he took the statue with his left hand and put it in front of him, and stretched out an index finger with his right hand and slowly stroked the face of the statue. He murmured to himself: "Also dignified, also lively, also healthy, also... Isn't she too beautiful? Is Ping Shan exhausted with him? Then it's too abrupt. How can such a woman be printed by a bookstore as a commodity for sale?" At this moment, the door rang, and Mrs. Zhang came. Guoqi stood up and said: "Mom, haven't you slept yet?" Mrs. Zhang said: "I was just about to sleep. Why are you talking to a person here?" Guoqi smiled and said: "I have a novel to write, and I am here to speculate on the tone of the speakers, so that I can start writing like that." Mrs. Zhang said: "It's already late, you should go to bed." As he said that, he reached out and closed the door, and stood outside and said: "Take off your clothes and go to bed, I'll leave after you turn off the lights." Guoqi thought that the weather was very cool at night, and he couldn't let his mother stand in the hall, so he urged his mother to sleep and turned off the lights. But Mrs. Zhang waited for him to turn over in bed before leaving. When he woke up the next morning, it was still a sunny day, Guoqi got out of bed happily, washed up quickly, and left home two or thirty minutes earlier than when he went to school every day without even drinking a sip of tea. From his home to the school, he could have walked straight through two alleys, but he seemed to have turned the familiar road into a kind of boredom. Today, he took a big detour and walked towards the alley where the apricot blossoms were exposed. He had a watch on his hand, and he would look at the watch every time he passed an alley. He was clearly calculating the relationship between time and speed. Walking slowly, pondering slowly, he accidentally turned into an alley and was shocked. Not only did he stop, but he also took a step back, it was the girl like Venus who came to him. She seemed to be surprised too, her body shrinking back, and the schoolbag she was carrying under her arm was sliding down, almost falling to the ground. She also felt that she had lost her control, smiled slightly, and immediately put away the smile, lowered her head and walked past. (Two Six)</p>

<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The recently enthroned King Edward VIII of England was born in 1894 and is only 43 years old now. Although such a young emperor is not uncommon, it is rare for someone over 40 to still be single. He came of age during World War I. His ascension to the throne coincided with the breakdown of the disarmament conference and the imminent outbreak of a second world war. His fate is very difficult. Even when he was the Prince of Wales, his trips to the colonies were sometimes imbued with political overtones. Therefore, even before ascending the throne, he had almost already taken over from King George to tour the borderlands.</p>
<p>During World War I, he was a student at Oxford University. On the fourth day after the start of the war, he was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Guards Regiment and asked the Secretary of War to join the front lines, saying that even if he were shot, it would not matter as he had four brothers. The Secretary of War, however, would not let him go because he was the heir to the British throne. He said, "It's not just a matter of being shot. If the Prince of Wales is unfortunately captured by the enemy, what will happen?" So the Prince of Wales had to leave disappointed.</p>
<p>He did not like living in the palace and found the greatest pleasure in being close to ordinary people, hence the name "Commoner Emperor." In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, he traveled to Japan. In Nikko, he saw the unique rickshaws and suddenly had the idea to try one. He forced his military attaché to sit on it and pulled the rickshaw for a while. However, it was photographed by a reporter and published in the newspaper the next day. The officials in charge of the reception thought that it was demeaning to the Prince, so they immediately asked the newspaper to find a way to destroy the photograph. However, the photo of the British Prince pulling a rickshaw remained in Japan, and when the Prince ascended the throne, the photo reappeared in the newspapers.</p>
<p>When Edward VIII was Prince of Wales, he loved sports, including golf, football, swimming, and hunting. He was keen on all of them. When he was in school, he gathered eleven young people at Buckingham Palace to form a football team. Later, nine of them participated in the Great War, with four wounded and four killed in action.</p>
<p>After the Great War, he spent most of his life overseas. He said, "The sea is my religion," which is certainly true. By 1932, he had traveled over twenty miles. The British politician most fond of traveling was MacDonald, but he had only traveled one-fifth as far as the Prince. He could not only row, but also fly a plane himself, so Mussolini could not claim to be the sole practitioner.</p>
<p>When he visited the United States, he was extremely popular with American women. Thousands of people came to shake his hand every day. Eventually, his right hand became swollen from shaking hands too much, so he used his left hand instead. When he was vacationing on Palm Beach, he encountered a large group of movie stars who shouted the Prince's name without any politeness, as if they were calling their lover. Although he was surrounded by this group of mermaids, he remained unmoved and has remained so until now. The British Prince was not only very innocent in his childhood, but still has a childlike quality in his middle age, hence the nickname "Big Kid."</p>

<h3 id="e218">More Than Ten Million Quintals of Foreign Rice Imported in a Year <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>According to statistics released by the International Survey Bureau, the import of foreign rice increased by more than 5.2 million quintals, or more than 18.57 million gold units, last year compared with the previous year. The import volume in the first half of the year was 11.186 million quintals, and in the second half of the year was 1.778 million quintals, totaling 12.964 million quintals. The reason for the increase is that the country suffered frequent disasters and reduced yields in the previous year, resulting in rice merchants ordering from foreign producers. Our country is known as a rice-producing area. Now, not only can our country's rice not be exported, but it must also be ordered from foreign countries. In one year, it has reached a staggering amount of more than 10 million quintals. It is appropriate that the Chinese countryside is bankrupt.</p>
<p>The country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. The people's food is of utmost importance to the country. If the people's food is obtained from foreign countries, then the national economy will leak out to foreign countries, which is a great loss to the country. The reason for the large-scale import of foreign rice is that, on the one hand, there are indeed frequent disasters in the country, and on the other hand, unscrupulous merchants seek only profit, ordering foreign rice because the price is cheap and the interest is higher. As a result, foreign rice floods the market, and the price of domestic rice cannot be raised. Low grain prices hurt farmers, which is a fixed rule. Everything is expensive, but the price of rice is low. The income farmers earn from farming is not enough to cover their basic needs, so many abandon the countryside and move to the cities. This is why the countryside is collapsing rapidly.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are inherently rice-producing regions, yet recently, incidents of rice-snatching and rent resistance have emerged one after another. This is an extremely dangerous and unstable state of society, and it should not be regarded as an ordinary minor problem. According to recent reports, the Zhejiang Department of Finance, due to the continuous decline in land tax revenue in various counties of Zhejiang, has repeatedly sent personnel to urge payment, but it is difficult to increase tax revenue. Therefore, it has specially dispatched consultants from the department to investigate various places and strictly urge payment. If the current situation continues, farming is not enough to make a living, so people are unwilling to farm, and landlords are unable to collect rent on their land, so they do not want to rent it out. This will inevitably lead to widespread land abandonment. Our country is inherently an agricultural country, and agriculture is bankrupt. If we were an industrial country, our industry, compared with other countries, would be equal to zero. So how will the country survive?</p>
<p>It is said that recently in Jiaxing, Jiashan, and other places, landlords have been in arrears with taxes for as long as seven years. Now the authorities have sent personnel to strictly pursue payment, requiring that all arrears be paid off within July. The landlords said that the grain comes from rent, and due to years of famine, rent cannot be collected. If rent is not collected, how can taxes be paid? Those who have little wealth go elsewhere, and those who are in economic difficulty have no choice but to face lawsuits. However, it is found that there are many farmers in the area who are unable to pay rent due to years of famine, but there are also not a few who deliberately resist rent under the guise of famine. If landlords sue them, the government will not accept the case. Even if they do, they will not strictly pursue it. If rent is not paid, but taxes must be paid in full, then how can farmers be made to farm, and landlords be made to pay taxes? There is no way to explain this.</p>
<p>Moreover, once this trend starts, other places will inevitably follow suit. Farmers will be happy if they do not have to pay rent for farming. The impact of this will inevitably lead to national chaos. If the authorities must implement a system of "the tiller owns the land," then the tiller must also pay taxes on the land. It is impossible to make the tiller own the land and make the non-tiller pay the taxes. Therefore, the urgent task now is to prohibit the import of foreign rice on the one hand, and strictly pursue rent arrears from tenant farmers on the other hand. These two must go hand in hand. If less foreign rice is imported, then the price of domestic rice will naturally increase. If the price of rice is high, then the lives of farmers will naturally be improved, and they will not resist rent. In recent years, famines have been seen everywhere from time to time. There are indeed many farmers who are unable to pay rent. These farmers should be allowed to be exempt from paying rent, and landlords should also be allowed to be exempt from taxes. If the land is not barren, but they refuse to pay rent, then the government should strictly pursue it. However, recently, local government offices in various places have not been very strict in handling rent collection matters, perfunctorily fulfilling their responsibilities, detaining people for more than ten days, and then considering the matter settled. Collecting land taxes without pursuing land rent is also not a fair way of doing things.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Business <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>Since the annual grand race meeting was suspended, spring in Straight Angle Town should have been the quietest time for business. Those men and women who barely survived the terrible winter, before the busy farming season started, took advantage of this opportunity to do odd jobs for people, saving up some money to use as farming capital. Our grocery store had no business after the Lantern Festival, but agricultural fertilizer and summer supplies, such as mosquito repellent and heat rash medicine... should all be purchased now, because once planting begins in the fields, we won't be able to spare manpower at the store, as my father and I are the only owners and employees in the store. No store in Straight Angle Town hires other employees because business is just too difficult to do in this small town. Every year, I help my father collect debts in the winter and buy goods in the spring. The Wanxing Grocery Store has managed to establish itself in Straight Angle Town.</p>
<p>This year, I planned to go to Shimen Bay to purchase goods. The water journey from Straight Angle Town to Shimen Bay takes one day and one night. In the past, there was a scheduled boat every three days, and you could be back within six days without much delay. But recently, there have been too few passengers, and the boat can't afford to employ three rowers year-round, so the boat no longer has a fixed schedule. It has to wait for a considerable number of passengers. As a result, the boat often departs but doesn't return.</p>
<p>After purchasing goods in Straight Angle Town, when I asked the boat boss at the dock, he was sitting on the bow smoking a dry pipe. He greeted me and then looked up at the sky and told me, "Two people have already asked. Now there are three including you. I'm afraid you'll have to wait two more days. But the weather is uncertain. It might rain tonight, then who knows..."</p>
<p>The boss's face is always so stern. He sighs more often than he speaks. But after drinking three cups of baijiu, he'll grab someone and talk non-stop, telling them: Since taking over this boat from his father, he's never seen a year like this. One boat every seven days, twenty days for a round trip. How are the four lives on our boat supposed to survive? He still has an old mother and children at home! So he drinks desperately, stumbles back to the boat, and starts yelling at the crew, "I'm not doing this thunder-struck boat anymore! Everyone scatter! We'll beach the boat and burn it for firewood, take some travel money and go to Liangshan to be bandits!"</p>
<p>The crew knows the boss's temper. Everyone relies on the boat for food. There's no business, what's the point of getting angry? They help him into the cabin to sleep. The next day, he wakes up and greets the crew, "I got drunk again yesterday. It's really terrible! What did I say?" He looks up at the sky and smokes his dry pipe.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it rained after I returned to the inn from the pier that day, dripping softly all night until dawn. Last year, I went to the countryside to collect debts, and it snowed heavily. I was stuck at Guanyu Pass until the end of the year before I could go home. This year, buying goods and it's raining again. I don't know when the boat will be able to return to Straight Angle Town. Thinking about it, I didn't sleep well that night. But what's the use? It continued to rain for five days. On the sixth day, it cleared up, and when I rushed back to the pier, the crew told me that the boss had gone to the bar to drink.</p>
<p>I went to the bar again, and the boss grabbed me, slurring his words, "Come, have a few drinks. The boat's leaving tomorrow. If there are no passengers in Shimen Bay, aren't the passengers in Straight Angle Town going to curse me, the boss?" He waved his fingers. "Hmph, it's been nine days again!"</p>
<p>He wasn't drunk that day. After leaving the bar, he helped me carry the goods from the inn onto the boat. He told the crew to notify the passengers who had come to inquire about the boat, who turned out to be the same two from six days ago. Both were from our town, one who owned a rice shop, and one who couldn't find work in Shimen Bay and was going home to farm.</p>
<p>We quickly started talking. Everyone felt that we should think of a way for the boat boss to continue running the boat on the original schedule of every three days. If things kept going like this, no one would dare to go out. Staying at an inn for ten days to half a month would cost the family two months of food.</p>
<p>"It's really like trying to steal a chicken and losing rice instead!" The day laborer patted his pouch. "One month of work lost me a string of cash!"</p>
<p>The rice shop owner also thought about his own business, and said angrily, "When the new grain comes on the market, the cheap goods are all taken by the big rice merchants. As soon as spring comes, the price of rice immediately goes up. You have to pay to eat your own rice. What's the point of rice paddies? You also have to pay for the inn and the boat fare. Poor people are just destined to starve!"</p>
<p>I looked at my pile of goods in the corner of the cabin. Those fertilizers that I bought with cash, I wouldn't see the money until the end of the year, and that's only if there's a harvest in the fields. If the farmers fail, where are we going to get the money? There's no business in the spring, and in the summer, we turn cash into goods and sell them on credit. After autumn, we still have no guarantee of collecting debts. This business is just too dangerous.</p>
<p>We were talking in the cabin, but the boss was alone at the stern drinking. He was probably drunk again, and leaned into the cabin after pushing the rear cabin plank, saying:</p>
<p>"This kind of business is for the birds! As soon as the boat gets to Straight Angle Town, I'm beaching it. I'll sell it for whatever price I can get and go to Liangshan to be a bandit!"</p>
<p>The three crew members also leaned in from behind. In the light of the kerosene lamp, everyone's face looked as if it were covered in a layer of frost.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Between Life and Death <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>Mingdi's illness was gradually getting worse. Every day, he lay on that bed with the already grayed-out sheets, moaning softly. It was as if he wanted to gradually spit out the pain that the disease had inflicted on him from his mouth. However, he did not have such great strength, and the moaning became an indefinite continuation.</p>
<p>When Lin and I went to see him, he reached out his weak arm with difficulty. His face was like the sudden appearance of sunshine in the long-lasting cloudy weather, only to be covered by dry, smoky-colored skin, making it even uglier. Compared to the dry orange peel, the only difference was that he still had a pair of eyes that flowed with longing and hope. Although he had no energy left, these eyes were the only dividing line between life and death. If the black wings of death embraced him, these eyes would definitely sink deeply and lose their light forever.</p>
<p>He looked at us with those eyes, sometimes using his eyes to say what he wanted to say. His throat seemed to have become hoarse, and thick clumps of phlegm tore his once loud and roaring voice into fragments. He said:</p>
<p>--I'm very grateful to you, ... sit down! I, ... I really want someone to accompany me and talk to me...</p>
<p>Lin and I didn't want him to talk too much. I knew that the wounds on his body might not have healed yet, and the vibrations in his lungs would not have recovered. It was possible that the cruel bacteria had already eaten them all.</p>
<p>--It's not suitable for you to talk too much. It's been many days and it's still not getting better, which is very annoying. You just need to rest quietly, and you will get better.</p>
<p>He nodded. Then he continued in that hoarse voice:</p>
<p>--I also think so, but I can't be quiet at all. When I think of you, I can't be quiet, I'm afraid that you will encounter something even worse than me...</p>
<p>--Don't think too much! We are far-sighted.</p>
<p>I said. For a moment, Lin frowned sadly, lost in thought. I knew that he was again comparing life...</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>...with death. He would say to me:</p>
<p>--These past two days, I have received so many stimuli. Marguerite from La Traviata, Gertisha from The Revival, have given me a lot of pain. Yesterday, I saw a car run over a person who was walking alive on the road,...</p>
<p>And today he saw Ming, who was seriously ill, his good friend, standing with one foot in life and one foot in death, the stimuli he received would of course be greater than those others.</p>
<h3 id="e221">"When I think of the past, tears fall!" <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>So I told him to talk to Ming, because I knew that Ming really needed us to tell him more about our recent situation. A seriously ill person has the greatest hope for life. Especially Ming, seeing that he could not do his own things, he naturally cared about his friends' affairs.</p>
<p>--Ming,--Lin said:--We are fine. The reading class has been established, and the students are very good. Several of your students have also come to us. I teach Mandarin, and he teaches English. They are all very happy to learn...</p>
<p>These words were like a powerful medicine, and Ming's illness seemed to have lessened somewhat; there was a passionate light in his eyes. I looked at his happy face and cute innocent smile, supplementing Lin's words:</p>
<p>--They hope you get well soon, they want to see you, I used the words "inconvenient" to dissuade them... Get well soon!...</p>
<p>He even laughed. Sunlight shone across his face.</p>
<p>--I also think so: Get well soon! Before, I didn't know how terrible death was, just like I didn't know how real the value of freedom was. From that loss of freedom, I understood the reason why a person loves and yearns for freedom; from being close to death, I understood the preciousness of life, but,...do you think I can get better?...so thin,...</p>
<p>His slightly louder tone dropped again. It was as quiet as after a rain. He looked at me with those eyes that radiated a questioning light, eagerly awaiting my answer, and his hand also raised, as if wanting me to get the most accurate answer from his body.</p>
<p>I looked at him, found hope from despair, and said:</p>
<p>--It will definitely get better, we both guarantee you will get better.</p>
<p>In this way, he retracted his doubtful gaze and smiled happily. Like a prisoner who had received an order of pardon, he was happy. So he said:</p>
<p>--You go back, you still have things to do... Although I want to talk to you more, I don't want to delay your work... Okay, you go,... say hello to them for me,...</p>
<p>We shook his hand, walked out of the room, gently closed the door, and went down the stairs.</p>
<p>Lin said to me again, as if he had reached a theorem:</p>
<p>--A person standing between life and death is the most lovely person. He is full of envy for people like us who are as lively as dragons and tigers. When we stand in front of him, it is as if we have brought life back to him from the world. Look at Ming, how happy he is...</p>
<p>--However, I don't think his illness is getting any better...</p>
<p>I said in a low voice, looking back at the closed door.</p>

<p>— Written by Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Liya (forcing a smile with shame) Hehe! I'm really embarrassed! I know these three sentences, because I know too much, so I mixed up Sun Yat-sen's last words with the speeches of foreigners, because I love to attend academic lectures the most, especially listening to lectures by knowledgeable great thinkers, great politicians, great scientists, great philosophers, and great writers and artists. I listen to a lot, so I easily mix up the last words of our Chinese great revolutionaries with the speeches of those foreigners. You must forgive me for this.</p>
<p>Jinghong Please don't be so polite, this kind of thing happens often, you just misunderstood it, there are still many people who don't understand the meaning of these three sentences!</p>
<p>Liya Those who don't understand the meaning of this sentence must be Suzhou people!</p>
<p>Jinghong (said with a smile) And Suzhou women, right!</p>
<p>Liya I'm afraid that even those men who go to teahouses to drink tea every morning and go to bookstores to listen to books at night wouldn't understand it.</p>
<p>Jinghong Do you mean that men who don't listen to books or drink tea can all understand the meaning of this sentence?</p>
<p>Luo Ya Students who have received education should all understand it, right?</p>

<p>Wang Shou! Zhou Ying</p>
<p>"The weather has been extremely cold recently, and the river surface is covered with very thick ice. It was not easy to catch a large blue fish today." This is what the fisherman Chen Da said to the farmer Zhang Er. During this conversation, some small luck arose, because the wealthy Wang Shou in Wang Town will be celebrating his 50th birthday tomorrow. It just so happens that because the river surface has been frozen recently, it is impossible to buy blue fish, no matter what the price. Of course! Chen Da could not miss this small fortune, so he ran as fast as he could to the wealthy Wang Shou's house. He used this rare blue fish to win the master's warm welcome and easily obtain a high price.</p>
<p>Wang Er, the gatekeeper of the wealthy man, was arrogant and thought that farmers could be deceived. He insisted on splitting the price Chen Da easily obtained for the fish with him, otherwise he would not let him in. However, although Chen Da was a fisherman, he was also good at scheming, so he agreed to split whatever reward he obtained for the fish equally with him. So Chen Da carried the fish inside. Wang Shou was overjoyed and asked how much money he wanted. Chen Da replied: "I want a hundred slaps on the palm." Wang was very surprised, but he had to agree, because otherwise he would not make a deal! One two three four five... When he was hit fifty times, Chen Da said that the remaining fifty hits should be given to the gatekeeper Wang Er, because this was the agreement between the two of them inside the gate. Whatever reward he obtained would be split equally. Wang Shou was furious when he heard this, severely beat Wang Er fifty times, and fired him. So, children, because Wang Er wanted to covet small gains, he ended up losing big. Therefore, those who covet small gains will definitely lose big.</p>

<p>Opening "Peony"</p>
<p>Peony flowers are uniquely called kings in the country. At that time, green leaves and red flowers were a beautiful sight. Riches and honor are unique and extraordinary. It ranks at the top, leading the masses of flowers. The flower god sets the scene in the second month of the flower season. A charming face and different kinds are created. I remember that the Qing dynasty was harsh in its literary inquisition. That poem was also uniquely called king. It suddenly set off a boundless disaster. How many scholars died because of this. It's a pity that after death, their bodies still had to be exposed. They were not allowed to bury their white bones in the ruins. And now the country's affairs are in turmoil. Who remembers the literary giants of the past? Wu Meicun, showed off his poetic madness. He angrily stood up for the beauty. Later, Prince Pingxi Wu Sangui bought it for a thousand gold. He was not allowed to delete the poem and hide it. Therefore, the Qing dynasty was foolish and indulged in great prisons. A single document put literary inquisition into effect. How many good teachers were executed. I pity their corpses with no one to bury them. They were scattered in the desolate suburbs in the chaos. The peony poem. It's really sad. That barbarian. He was fierce. He actually deprived all scholars of their rights. The heroes of Yunnan and Guizhou rebelled against the Qing dynasty. It was also because of that, unbearable cruel and poisonous heart. Pity... ... ... Purple peony</p>

<p>— Bai Zi</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu's second detective film after "Jade Horse," "Diamond," has been approved after review.</p>
<p>The three characters of "Diamond" all contain the radical for gold, so we can know what the content of "Diamond" is about? What does it expose? There is no doubt that it is "money slaves, people blinded by greed."</p>
<p>"Diamond" says that many scenes use real knives and guns, which are shocking. The actor Li Qing was injured while playing with a pistol for "Diamond," his head was broken and bleeding. The newspapers published this as a major event in the film industry in the past twenty-five years. Therefore, "Diamond" is attracting attention, which is also an ideal thing.</p>
<p>When "Diamond" was being filmed, everyone on the set, big and small, felt very novel because it was full of realism. No wonder.</p>
<p>"Diamond" will have many novel shots. Xu Gong Xinfu has worked hard.</p>

<p>The Sunday Experimental Little Theater will perform "Northeast Home" at the Xin Guang Grand Theater next Sunday (31st). This script was published in "Reading Life." There are four characters in "Northeast Home": an older brother, a younger sister, a mother, and a sister-in-law. The older brother is a traitor, while the younger sister is a patriotic woman. The mother and sister-in-law are both weak and incompetent. Readers, try to guess what the ending of this "Northeast Home" will be?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theater previously screened the Soviet Russian revolutionary war film "Chapayev." Due to the large number of people who were unable to get tickets, it will be re-screened for two days starting today.</p>
<p>The scene in "Waves Washing Sand" where Jin Yan throws himself into the water and flees was filmed last winter. During the current screening, when this part was shown, Jin Yan jokingly said: "I'm shivering."</p>
<p>Zhang Yi has a pipe that he never leaves his hand. It is said that it was given to him by fans in Hunan.</p>
<p>Gu Lan Jun is very popular in the film industry, but she is more polite than before. Gu Lan Jun has become more experienced.</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang takes acting very seriously and doesn't look like an "amateur moviegoer."</p>
<p>Ge Zuo Zhi accidentally fell into the water while filming "The Lost Lamb" in Suzhou. He was later rescued by cinematographer Zhou Damin, thus avoiding disaster.</p>
<p>Han Lan Gen plays a diplomat from the warlord era in "Go to Nature." Jin Yan once said, "Any country with such a diplomat is bound to lose power and humiliate the nation."</p>
<p>Tan Ying stars in "Little Lingzi." Little Lingzi is a "young lady" from the countryside who is very beautiful. Later, she is taken a fancy to by the son of her tenant farmer and brought to Shanghai, where she is greatly played with by the son of the tenant farmer. Tan Ying, in her infatuation, truly loves her master, but as a result, Tan Ying is like a mute eating coptis chinensis—suffering in silence.</p>

<p>Hong Shen, as an outsider, occupies a great advantage in the screenwriting department of "Ming Yi," so much so that some people say he is the "Tai Shang screenwriter" of "Ming Yi." Yes, Hong Shen is now as popular as Tian Han was a few years ago. Not only does "Ming Yi" want his scripts, but Tian Yi also needs him in this way. Some say that after the establishment of "Ming Er," the head of the screenwriting department of "Ming Yi," Ouyang Yuqian, will be transferred to "Ming Er," and Hong Shen may enter "Ming Yi" as the head of the screenwriting department. This statement naturally has some possibility. Because the person in charge of "Ming Yi" is Zhang Shichuan, and the reason why Hong Shen is well-connected in the directing department of "Ming Yi" is nothing more than Zhang Shichuan's relationship. However, Hong Shen himself stated that he will go to Guangxi in mid-August to serve as a professor at a university. If the Japanese student life drama is performed before August, he also intends to go to Japan for sightseeing. The official establishment date of "Ming Er" is said to be August 1st; however, the date of Hong Shen's departure to Guangxi also happens to be August. Will Hong Shen enter "Ming Yi"? Or will he go to Guangxi? It seems that we have to wait until August to find out.</p>
