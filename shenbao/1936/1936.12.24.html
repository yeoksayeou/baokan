<h3 id="c53">一九三七年度　日本財政之鳥瞰（一） <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>（一）預算案之特徵</p>
<p>一九三七年度的日本預算案，已經在預算閣議上通過了。總額達三十億四千一百萬元，爲日本空前的龐大預算。此預算，若與一九三六年度的預算比較，則歲入方面增加七億三千六百萬元，歲出方面增加七億三千萬元。若與一九三一年度的預算比較，則已超出倍額以上了。</p>
<p>綜合這預算案的特徵，可得以下數項：</p>
<p>（一）軍事費佔十四億元。表示空前的膨脹。</p>
<p>（二）新設地方財政調整交付金之制度。</p>
<p>（三）除抉行一般增稅外，更實行烟草增價，郵便增價，郵貯利下，以及增加關稅等。</p>
<p>（四）放棄高橋前藏相之公債漸减方針，採用公債增發方針，規定發行將近十億元的公債計劃。</p>
<p>（二）所謂廣田內閣　之庶政一新</p>
<p>廣日組閣時，曾高唱庶政一新的口號。這口號一直到現在，都還是一張未兌現的支票。所以一九三七年度的日本預算案，表示空前膨脹之主要原因：第一，固然是鑑於目下的國際情勢，感覺到國防之重要，不能不把巨額的經費，用在充實國防上；第二，也是爲了要實行現內閣的重要國策。現內閣的重要國策買行費，根據日本政府所發表者，有下列數項：（單位白萬元</p>
<p>（一）國防之充實。六九一</p>
<p>（二）敎育之刷新改善。</p>
<p>（三）中央以及各地稅制之整備。　二三七</p>
<p>（四）國民牛活之安定：五三</p>
<p>（一）災害防除設備。　一九</p>
<p>（二）保健設備之擴充。　九</p>
<p>（三）農山漁村經濟之更生，及中小商工業之振興等。</p>

<h3 id="c54">如何鞏固經濟基礎 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>自西安事變發生以後。我國經濟組織仍能保持其安全。殊可欣慰。然此應歸功於金融統制之成功。而金融之能否穩定。則其繫於物價之是否安定者更大。我國物價輒因供求之間稍有軒輊。卽見起伏甚巨。在平時如此。非常時期恐有更甚。蓋國內市塲貨物失其調劑。有餘則不能蓄積任其外洩內腐。不足則無力向外廣。求以備萬一之需。因是不患過剩。卽患不給器淺易益危險滋甚。舉例而言。近來水泥因建築工程需求稍切。不能不求於日貨北方有事。媒之來源稍阻。而煤荒之聲浪洋溢乎耳。媒價已接二連三上漲矣。糧食爲養命之源。年來投機化之深刻。正無殊於紗花。而迄無有效之調節方策。如粵省請免洋米稅。在本米號稱豐收之環境中。自所不許但湘皖贛之米正可濟粵省民食之需。此而不圖。徒責入以不應購洋米。何以饜粵人之望。又如公路之開闢日廣。而汽車汽油之需。仍不能自給。一旦供給斷絕公路雖有若無。管理匯兌卽使告成。而如貿易無力控制。一仍其舊則其效亦未能昭著。凡此所述均係鞏固經濟基礎之必要步驟。固非一蹴可幾。但世事之變化若斯其烈。其尙容吾人有觀望因循之餘地乎。</p>
<p>且也自英美法協定成立。國際貨幣安定之可能性。自較前爲大。美洲和會已閉幕。美國所提减低關稅壁壘使美洲各國享受同等貿易機會之建議。亦已通過。歐洲方面。對於撤廢關稅壁壘之呼聲亦高。國際經濟界日後變化正多。而我爲國際經濟之一員。如何應付環境。急起自謀不容緩矣。</p>

<p>— 北特平信</p>
<p>民衆護物之「通俗化」運動、故都方面、前幾年即已有之、但其形成一種風尙而蓬勃一時者、却自本年通俗讀物編刊社規模大加擴充始、此中迴環曲折、幾經演變發展、雖在主觀上、多賴少數學者之苦心支持、而近幾年來、我國客觀社會環境之需要、實亦爲此種運動所以蓬勃一時之最大因素、民國十八九年之際、所謂「文藝大衆化」口號、在滬上提出後、北平方面、亦立起反應、再與五四運動以來之啟蒙精神相合、乃遂以另一姿態出現、期即所謂「通俗化」是也、是以在精神上、北平之「通俗化」運動、仍為橫績「五四」之啟蒙精神、不過受滬上「大衆化」運動刺激、而以嶄新面目出現而已、是以「通俗化」與啟蒙運動之不同、在於本質和目的、「通俗化」與「大衆化」之不同、在於精神和方法、在今日如仍提倡「五四」時之啟蒙運動、自嫌不足、但提倡大衆化」者、又往往在方法與精神上與實際抵觸、遭受阻攔、是以處吾國今日之形勢下、對於以啟蒙精神、企圖用新內容敎育民衆之「通俗化」運動、實有注意之必要、爰將採訪所得、誌之如次、</p>
<p>（一）讀物「通俗化」運動者</p>
<p>從事此種運動之機關、最主要者、為通俗讀物編刊社、該社成立、遠在五年以前、但以前因經費無着、人手亦少、且無固定社址、祇由少數對此有興趣者、在熱心之學者贊助下、勉力支持而已、其工作亦祇限於搜集舊日流行民間之讀物、加以編排分類、僅以各種鼓詞而論、據云、即已達一兩千種以上、出版方面，亦祗有在力量許可範圍內、或附於其他文化機關名義下、出過幾種刊物及單行本、流通亦未能廣闊、本年以來、規漸模具、現已有固定社址一處、地址爲北平觀音常七號內有房十餘間、設編輯發行等部、辦事人員及工友、共的十餘人、記者曾赴該社參觀、見其工作甚爲緊張、目前該社經費來源、仍甚困難、大概全靠各方捐贈及津貼、如最近中央大學校長羅家倫捐助五百元、即其一例、月餘以前、聞該社曾具呈冀察當局、請求補助、其後未得下文、不知究竟如何、</p>
<p>除通俗讀物編刊社外、熱心此種「通俗化」運動者、尙有北平硏究院、及其他文化機關、個人方面、熱心贊助者亦不在少數、</p>
<p>（二）「通俗化」之民衆讀物一瞥</p>
<p>據記者調查、從事「通俗化」運動之機關及個人、對於吾國人民中包含有廣大之文盲羣一事、確時予顧及、同時又鑑於普及敎育與改良方塊漢字一事、又非短期內所可成就處目節情形下、欲以新知識教育民衆者、除用文字外、祇有資藉圖畫·影戲·及大鼓書等方法、但因經費及其他種種事買限制、截至目前爲止、大鼓書·影戲·等藝員之養成、僅有計劃、而猶未見舉辦、巳有成績者、不過讀物之編刊、及圖畫之印行等兩方面、</p>
<p>已編刊之讀物、共有十餘種、粗粗舉之、定期刊如民衆週報·大衆知識·（半月刊）一爲通俗讀物編刊社自己印行、一爲託上海亞東圖書館印行、前者係以淺顯文字、介紹民衆以種種國際國內之政治·社會·經濟·等常識　與夫科學史地等知識、如其創刊號上、曾將本報九月十九日之瀋陽通信一篇、由文言繙成顯淺白話、使無機會讀到報紙之民衆、亦借以略悉日本壓迫我東三省同胞之狀况、卽其一例、後者係專載有系統之論文、然一經立有系統、文字卽不免較深、不過其終極目的、在於向通俗方面做去、叢書方面、可分甲乙二種、甲種叢書內容、係以自然科學常識·社會科學常識·史地演述·名人傳記·故事小說等爲主、已出者、有大禹爲公忘私·勾踐報吳·曹沫雪恥·等八九種、其目的在於以此類讀物、代替流行民間之有害不健全讀物、如七俠五義。施公案等類、乙種叢書、內容雖與甲類相似、但體栽上却以鼓詞·舊劇詞·俗曲·小調·等類出現、現在已刊行者、已有六十餘種、此中以內容分之、又可分爲（一）國恥類、爲杜全死守杜家峪·胡阿毛開車人黃浦·大鬧趙家樓·等等（二）社會類、如白面鬼等等、（三）敎育類、如有眼的瞎子等等、（四）史地類、如宋哲元大戰喜峯口·淞滬戰·等等、此種叢書目的、在於代替民間更低級而同時亦流行最廣之不健全讀物、如哭五更。妓女悲秋等等、封面書內、均附有新姿態之有意義揷畫多幅、定價低廉、且不甚禁止翻印、除定期刊及叢書外、在各報上、以副刊姿態出現者亦屬屢見不鮮、其最著者、如本報副刊之「通俗講座」、中央日報副刊之「民風」、北平晨報之「生活與敎育」、世界日報之「社會科學·「現代兒童」·華北日報之「通俗說壇」、實報之「通俗敎育」、民聲報之「民俗週刋」、新北平報之「公民週刊」等等、其內容。文字態度、雖各有不同、但同一之目的、均爲推進讀物「通俗化運動、於此運動蓬勃時、一一以新姿態先後出現、確有甚大意義、</p>
<p>圖畫方面、亦頗成續卓著、雖形式上仍用舊時之年畫等類、但不獨內容有深長意味、即筆調亦完全新穎、與舊時年畫不健全而又沉腐者、根本不能相提並論、現已再版及正在印刷中者、已有數十幅、以內容分之、可分爲（一）歷史故事類、如岳飛傳·班超投筆。等等、（二）婦女生活類、如農家婦女生活之春·夏·秋·冬·各幅、（三）兒童敎育類、如子孫萬代等等、（四）大衆生活類如、七十二行八幅、農家生活之春·夏·秋·冬·各幅、（五）戲劇類、如打漁殺家等等、（六）滑稽諷刺及勸善類、如鷸蚌相爭。賭徒王大的故事等等、（七）破除迷信類、如財神·壽星·天官·鐘旭等等、（八）風景名勝類、如北平各名勝之北海·頤和園等等、（九）愛國故事類、如義軍女將姚瑞芳。翠紅姑娘殉難記、各畫印刷精美、筆觸老到、價亦低廉、均屬未之前見、而允爲有意義者、厥爲各圖畫上之題詞、茲錄其數則、。以見一斑、如題農家生活云我國人民四萬萬、農人佔去一大半、農村破產無人問、整個國家要玩完、起七十二行云、七十二行買賣多、各自賺錢各自活、大家齊心買國貨、國泰民安笑呵呵、題兒童敎育云、小寳寳生的好、又愛讀　又愛淘、不怕槍彈不怕砲、只怕洋人把我笑、題冬季之婦女生活云、冬季裏來北風，零、你織布來她紡棉、倘若同胞都能幹、國家何愁沒財源、</p>

<h3 id="c193">墨子拒楚救宋 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 顔淑</p>
<p>——救國要靠實力，不能徒托空言——</p>
<p>「唉，做弱國真不好做呀！」有一個晚上，墨子獨坐在斗室裏，對著當窗點著快要給狂風吹滅的臘燭嘆息。他一面說，一面撩衣起來，拿許多書高高的堆上，遮蓋了窗葉一個大破洞，不讓狂風吹進來。</p>
<p>他是戰國時代的宋國人，不幸那時霸道正盛，強的要攻打弱的，多數要併吞少數，弄到常常殺人滿城滿野。他是一個仁者，不忍看見這樣悲慘的大屠殺，因此他提倡「非攻」。他知道戰爭是趨於不相愛的，因此他提倡「兼愛」。他看出相愛是相利的，但可惜世人蔽於私慾，不明白這個道理，所以他不辭勞苦，跋涉到各國宣傳去。他現在要至齊國來宣傳　的兼愛主義。從宋到齊是要經過獨魯國的，他不願打擾魯國人士來招呼他，悄悄地躲著一所小客店住着。他正打算着明天起程往齊國去，不想忽然聽見楚國快要攻打宋國的消息。那末，他不得不先回頭救國了。</p>
<p>他很焦急的坐着等天亮城門開好起行。他思前想後，不覺恨起這個助戰的罪魁公輸般來了。上月他和般在楚國所談的話，他還記得很清楚。這是一個雨天無聊的下午，墨子來訪般，般留他吃飯，飯後就這樣談起來：</p>
<p>「我真得意，我造出來在船上打仗的軍器多好啊，越國果然看我打败了！」般很高兴的一面擦嘴，一面笑对着墨子说。</p>
<p>「以你的技能，如果盡心帮助你的祖國（般是魯國人），使牠脫離齊國的壓迫，豈不是很好嗎？」墨子又像忠吿又像譏笑的說着。</p>
<p>「唔——」般臉紅了，說不出話，過了一會，才道：「魯國太小，英雄無用武之地，怎能怪我離開牠呢？」</p>
<p>「照你這樣說來，人就難　了。國因為小便得不到您的國民的愛護，此風一長，將來誰都只知道自私，恐怕弱小的兒女，衰老的父母也沒人照顧了。這還成什麽世界呢？」墨子有一點生氣</p>
<p>般冷笑道：「先生，您又在說仁義了！我且問您，我舟戰有鈎拒，不曉得您的仁義，也有鈎拒不？」</p>
<p>「怎麽沒有？我仁義的鈎拒比您舟戰的鈎拒好得多呢。我是用愛來鈎，用恭來拒的。如果不用愛來鈎，就得不到人親你，不用恭來拒，就會惹人狎侮你了：狎而不親，就會弄到離散了。所以互相利一樣呢。今兒您用鈎來鈎人，人也用鈎來鈎您；您用拒來拒人，人也用拒來拒您，所以互相鈎，互相拒，就等於互相害一樣呢。因此我這仁義的鈎拒，比您那舟戰的鈎拒好。」墨子說得很有理，般駁不過他，許久　　　　　　　　　　　　經知過了，想不到他這次竞然替楚王做好了攻城的雲梯，準備攻宋了。</p>
<p>墨子這次還是決定　般講理去。他從魯國起程，急於救宋，一直不休息，跑了十日十夜。脚破了，他也不管，看見流血太多，才撕下身上穿的衣服　塊來裏。好容易跑到郢都來找着般。般看見墨子來勢洶洶，曉得他有話要說，忙問道：「先生來了嗎？有什麽話吩咐我？」</p>
<p>墨子喘了幾下氣，才上氣不接下氣的說道：「北方有幾個侮辱了我的人，想請你去殺掉他。」般扶墨子坐下，露出不高興的樣子。墨子道：「如果這事成功，送十塊金報酬您。」</p>
<p>「我是以不殺人為義的。」</p>
<p>墨子聽了這話，很受感動，忙起來拜了兩拜，表示同情於般，然後很嚴肅的說道：「請您聽我說幾句話：我在北方聽說您已經做好雲梯，就要攻打宋國了宋有什麽罪過呢？荊國即楚國地有餘而民不足。殺所不足而爭所有餘，不可以呌做智；攻打無罪的宋，不可以呌做仁；您明知不對，而不力爭，不可以呌做忠；力爭而不得，不可以呌做強義；不殺少而殺衆，不可以呌做知類。」</p>
<p>般聽了黑子的話，表示心服。墨子道：「那末，您　　　　　　　　　　。」</p>
<p>「這可不成，因爲攻宋的計劃，我已經對王說過了。」</p>
<p>「那末，何不介紹我見見王呢？」</p>
<p>般馬上答應了。墨子忙在衣包裹檢出一件舊禮服蓋上，胡亂扣上一兩個鈕兒，便跟般上朝見楚王去。他們談不上幾句話，墨子就直接的問楚王道：「　如有一個人，不要他自己的文軒，却想偷鄰人的破車，不要他自己的錦繡，却想偷鄰人的短氈襖；不要他自己的米肉，却想要偷鄰人的糟糠。王以為這是什麽樣的人呢？」</p>
<p>「這人一定有偷摸病了。」楚王不假思索的答道。</p>
<p>墨子馬上乘機直說道：「荊的地面方五千里，宋的地面不過方五百里，這就是像文軒和破車之比一樣。荊有雲夢（在今湖北監利石首　縣境），滿是犀兕麇鹿，同時江漢的魚鼈龜稱富天下，至於宋，甚至難免鮒魚也沒有。這就是像米肉和糟糠之比一樣。荊有長松，文梓，梗，相，豫章，宋元大樹，這就是像錦繡和短氈襖之比一樣。今兒王之攻宋，臣以爲也屬於這一類的行徑」。</p>
<p>「對！對！您說得有理。　楚王點着頭說，但是公輸般是天下的巧士，他替我做雲梯，一定能攻取宋　　　　　　　　　。」</p>
<p>墨子此時也知道惑於利慾的人是不可以義理曉喻的，不能不提出他最後的有效方法，實力，來控制楚王的侵略野心，於是他要求和般比較一下彼此的攻守方略誰高誰低。他們就在楚王的面前表演。墨子把身上的皮帶解下來當做城，折箸當做軍械。般用九種機變來攻城，墨子也用九種機變來拒敵，結果般攻城的軍械，如雲梯，撞車，飛石，連弩等都用完了，還攻不入墨子的防綫。這顯然是般輸了。但他不肯認輸，懷着惡意說：「我知道怎樣能羸您，但我不說出來」。墨子看穿了般這一套，笑道：「我知道您要怎樣羸我的，但我不說出來」。</p>
<p>楚王很驚奇的問墨子知道的是什麽。墨子道：「公輸子之意，不過想殺臣。他以為殺了臣，宋國一定沒人守禦，可以攻破了；而不知臣的弟子離滑釐等三百人已經拿了臣守禦的器械，在宋城上等待楚師呢。就是殺了臣，宋還是不能攻下的。</p>
<p>對！對！真好法子！那末我也不攻宋國了」。楚王很堅決的說。</p>
<p>般還不放心，秘密差人到宋國打聽，果然宋國已有準備了。攻有備之國，是軍法所大忌，楚王只好把出伐之令收回了。</p>

<p>— 李素</p>
<p>羅馬與加太基戰爭中的一段故事</p>
<p>（列鳩拉斯是羅馬的一個大將軍，被加太基人虜了去做囚犯。這故事的開端是：有幾個加基的領袖，到監獄裏去近視列鳩拉斯，他們要列鳩拉斯去呌羅馬來求和。）</p>
<p>一、加太基監獄裏的一間囚室</p>
<p>（列）：先生們，守監的人吿訴我你們要跟我談話。</p>
<p>（甲）：是的，列鳩拉斯，我們希望把現在這塲戰事結束了，因為兩方面都有重大的人命損失，我們想好了一個計劃可以和羅馬講和，我們到你這兒是希望你能幫忙我們把牠實行。</p>
<p>（列）：先生，幹嗎對我說和不和的事？我怎麽能幫你們的忙？我豈不是一個敗將而且是你們的辦虜嗎？</p>
<p>（甲）：我們確信你那些羅馬同胞不知道在非洲的情況的嚴重，若是他們知道你戰敗了而且做了囚虜，我們相信他們一定歡迎一個與我們講和的機會。</p>
<p>（列）：先生，我相信羅馬會戰騰的。我知道我本國非等到玫下了加太基是不會息兵的。我們幹吧要跟你講和呢？</p>
<p>（乙）：當你的同胞明白了你是我們的囚虜，你的軍隊，至少剩一的那些是在我們的掌握中，加太基現在是安然是不患羅馬的攻擊時，你不必再肯定他們會與你同意了。</p>
<p>（列）：你聽說的是真的，可是在我要國，比列鳩拉斯更偉大的人是準備了而且樂於爲羅馬而捨生的。我的希望基：現在事情的不幸善不會繼續多久。但是中太基人，你們要我幹什麽事呢？</p>
<p>（甲）：我們願意給你自由，讓你問羅馬去。然而有兩個條件，除非你答應履行這些條約我們是不能讓你去的。</p>
<p>（列）：那末讓我知道吧。我要知道了你們的目的，我才能決定答應或是不答應。</p>
<p>（甲）：我們希望你答應你一到羅馬立刻把你被擄的這塲敗仗的損失報吿羅馬人民。你特別是要報吿被殺的兵有多少，被虜的有多少，當他們從列鳩拉斯口裡聽到這些報吿，他們再不能懷疑，所以他們也不致於不明瞭羅馬在這次戰事裏是失敗的。</p>
<p>（列）：還有第二個條件是什麽？</p>
<p>（乙）：若是羅馬人聽了你的報吿以後拒絕求和，你得答應回到加太基來。</p>
<p>（列）：我很願意答應你們這兩件事·我會報吿這次戰役的損失，還會提及被殺與被虜者的實數。而且，若是我報吿之後，羅馬的領袖們不願意講和，我以我羅馬大將的信譽答應你們我一定會回到加太基來。</p>
<p>（乙）：贊成。明兒早上便把我們這次談話的結果報吿加太的政府。你就可以得到自由去乘那第一艘開往羅馬的船。</p>
<p>（列）：謝謝你們，先生。晚安·</p>
<p>加太基人：晚安列鳩拉斯。</p>
<p>二、在羅馬</p>
<p>（列鳩拉斯和羅馬政府及軍隊的幾個領袖坐在他的房子裏·）</p>
<p>（列）：歡迎我家裏來，朋友們。</p>
<p>羅馬人甲：列鳩拉斯，能得你回到羅馬來是很愉快的事情。羅馬是不常有機會看見她的將官們的，加太基之戰把我們的許多最好的士兵留在非洲了。聽說你給我們帶了加太基的消息來。</p>
<p>（列）：你們聽到的是真的，先生。我回家來報吿在非洲的戰事現在是不利於我們。上次我參加的那塲戰事羅馬是失敗了，我的全部軍隊不是被殺便是成爲囚虜了。我自己也被擄到加太基囚禁着。而且我答應加太基人把戰事的嚴重情況吿訴羅馬人。他們也呌我傳達說若是羅馬人求和，加太基人是願意議訂和平條約的。</p>
<p>（乙）：和平！你，列鳩拉斯，是一個軍人，却來對我們說同敵講和？</p>
<p>（列）：見的·加太基人是爲這個目的派我來的。我現在已經履行了我的條約。可是我現在已經報吿過了，我願意以一外羅馬將軍的身份來勸吿你們。可以嗎？</p>
<p>（甲）：當然啦，列鳩拉斯。你喜歡說多久說多久。我們希望聽到你所要說的一切。</p>
<p>（列）：我堅強地勸吿我的國家不要考慮什麽和約。羅馬失敗了幾次，現時我們在非洲的兵力不能攻下加太基，這都是很真實的。加太基人損失很重大，而且漸漸的厭倦爭戰了。我想他們對我們提議和約是因爲他們駭怕將來。</p>
<p>（乙）：這真是個好消息，列鳩拉斯。這兒，在羅馬，是很不容易確實知道在非洲的情形。也不知道相信誰好。然則你勸我們繼續這戰事嗎？</p>
<p>（列）：不管一切，就這樣幹去。若是繼續這戰爭稍爲長久一點，加太基就會落在我們手中了。</p>
<p>（甲）：我希望替我自己與羅馬政府對你所說的表示感謝。你已經使我們明瞭了我們的責任。</p>
<p>三、第二天原處</p>
<p>（當列鳩拉斯同他的家人說着話時，有幾個羅馬人走進來。）</p>
<p>（乙）：我來是代替羅馬的民衆和領袖說話，你應該馬上就率領我們預備遣派到非洲的新軍中之一支，這是他們一致的希望，你的長時期的經騐和充分的明瞭在非洲的戰事情形，使你成爲負荷這個責任的唯一人物。</p>
<p>（列）：我很抱歉的對你說，你所提議的是不可能的。</p>
<p>（甲）：不可能！為什麽？</p>
<p>（列）：因為我明天必得回去。</p>
<p>他的妻：回去加太基嗎？啊，列鳩拉斯，我不能再讓你離開我們了，看看你這兒的孩子們！我求你在未決定以前爲他們想想吧。</p>
<p>（甲）：回到加太基！那是太傻了。若是你回去而我們的政府拒絕講和，那你將要遇到什麽事情呢？</p>
<p>（列）：我很知道我的國家不會講和的。無論如何，我已經答應了，若是羅馬拒絕求和，我就立刻回到加太基去的。</p>
<p>（妻）：那就是說你一定會死了，列鳩拉斯。</p>
<p>（列）：自從離開加太基我就已知道我的行動意義。可是我希望對我拉孩子們說聲再見，讓我的妻知道我期望她做個勇敢的人像羅馬女子所應做的，而且呌羅馬繼續戰鬥。我堅強地相信不到幾個月，加太基就會變爲我們的。</p>
<p>（乙）：勇敢的列鳩拉斯！羅馬人民將永遠忘不了你的名字。</p>
<p>（列）：我所要求的是請羅馬善視我的妻與孩子，使他們永遠不會缺少金錢和朋友。現在，再見了我的同胞！天漸漸的晚了，在我未走以前我有好些話要對我的妻和兒女說的。</p>
<p>羅馬人：晚安，列鳩拉斯。你所說的一切都會傳達給羅馬的人民知道。</p>
<p>四、列鳩拉斯回到加太基</p>
<p>剩下要說的就是列鳩拉斯實踐了他的約言。他回到加太基，而羅馬則繼續戰鬥下去。當羅馬拒絕講和的時候列鳩拉斯是被加太基人很殘酷地殺害了。但是到末了羅馬戰爭了。比這個更好的一件事是歷史並記得列鳩拉斯爲對一個敵人守信而犧牲他的生命。</p>

<p>— 大川</p>
<p>—讀史笑錄之一</p>
<p>歷代亡國的帝王，其慘痛的情狀，怕沒有過於北宋徽欽宗二帝了。但二帝之所受辱，北宋局面之所結亡，論史者每以北宋之衰徴，力不能搞金兵之大舉南下，此固為史實，然北宋之亡，亦有徽欽二帝自取之辱，以自求滅亡也。</p>
<p>當徽宗時，金人滅遼之後，國勢強盛，徽宗雖如約取得燕京之典章文物，都已被金人掠奪而空，同時還須年輸燕京代收稅一一百萬緡並銀絹各二十萬匹於金，後來徽宗屢次違約起　，以致金兵南下問罪，促成徽宗的內禪，和欽宗的繼承。後來金兵六萬圍犯汴京，而宋有勤王之師不下二十餘萬，乃竟不用李網的決戰主張，而反罷之以謝金人，結果雖因太學生之請復暫起用，然而忍辱求和，割讓三鎮，輸巨額財物，並以親王宰相爲外質，目尊金爲伯父。已開歷史上罕有的恥辱。</p>
<p>欽宗在這樣重痛巨創之後，又屢次敗盟，所以金兵又大舉南下，金　黏罕率兵渡河，圍攻汴京，不久又屯兵索財物土地求和，並遣以探懈宋兵。當時朝廷大臣，皆無智謀，主和主戰，莫衷一是！終於上下茍安，而不以金為慮。後來金兵又南下，汴京再度被陷，其時京師之兵，能戰者十不得三四人，並妄聽妖人郭京作法，開門迎戰，自促敗亡。避戎夜話記其事云：「初，京師被圍，朝廷急於命將，有郭京都，乃殿前司龍衛營兵員耳，盛傳能用六甲法，可生擒黏罕，餘衆可掃盪無遺，朝廷深信不疑。」云：「其所召人皆市井游惰，色色有之，不問騎射善否，但擇其年命合六甲都足矣……郭京談笑自若，似有道者，擇日出兵，可致太平。」這種妖法，很像遜消戌戊攻變時拳匪之亂，其禍國害民，痛不可言。避戎夜話」又云：「二十五日，宣化門大開，郭京出兵……金兵兩兩翼翼鼓譟而進，衝斷前車，一掃而空，若刈茅草，居後者妒忍曳矣。……其守禦之人與白姓前者，其城遂陷。心中不騰憤慨。</p>
<p>汴京陷後，黏罕遺使求兩宮　虜營議和及　地事宜，朝廷一切文物典籍，搬掠一空。時京中又　雪，米價騰貴，餓殍盈道，而金兵復大劇掠，人民死傷不可勝數。亡國的慘壯是如此的。</p>
<p>二帝北行，受盡人間種種慘痛，而至於途死殺身，後世讀史者，未嘗不爲之唏噓下淚也。南燼紀聞錄上卷云：「二帝車駕金營，百姓　萬人阻車駕，號泣不容行，帝亦泣下。」又云：「二帝二後皆在坭中伏蹲，飲食粗糲，形容黧黑，目睛昏，太上誤墮其中，骨碌都拯而出之：鄭太後亦驚仆傷足。」又云：「二帝爲金人所閉，日中始得荳餅四枚，四人分食。」代尊貴的帝王，亡國後的身世，眞非凄咽之淚所能哭訴的。</p>
<p>南燼記聞銀録下卷云：「兵士紥二帝二後於庭下，至以便溺澆之。」又云：「二後足跣不能復行，雖乘馬，足皆生瘡，肌肉瘦瘠，二帝亦枯槁不類生形，爲監者所詬卋朴鞭，欲死無路。」又云：「金主兌殿，左右執二帝後膝跪於地，皆再拜訖。」又云：「左右　　　　口出血，齒碎，乃拽去。復入前室中向之，縛之以繩，帝泣不能出聲。</p>
<p>亡國帝王的慘辱，這已是到了極點，但徽欽二帝之禍，還不止此，其道死殺身的情景的記載，目不忍睹：土坑中顧視上皇，則僵踞死矣，少帝大慟。左右引土人以木貫上皇屍，焚之半燼以水滅之，仍貫屍棄坑中。」徽宗之慘死尤使欽宗悲慟不能自勝，竊憤續録云「或曰，少帝泣下曰：「吾父之墮坑沉水，吾母埋於路旁，吾妻捲以竹席，何異犬豕之死！吾身又未審如何？若死，亦未必不若此也。」果然欽宗的悲慟，不出於其預料其慘死，而其死更較慘痛。竊憤續録又云：「正隆六年，金主亮宴諸王大臣於講武殿大閣兵馬，令帝與濱海侯爲撀鞠，旣合，有胡騎數百，自塲隅來，直犯帝前：有羯衣者射延禧貫心死於馬下，帝見之失色墮馬，又有紫衣者以箭中帝，帝崩，不收屍，以馬蹂之土中。帝是年六十歲終，馬足之禍也。」</p>
<p>北宋亡國後之二帝二後，是這樣的死去了，留下在歷史上是一葉忍辱呑聲之血淚的痛痕，永遠地做爲後世亡國者殷鑑。</p>
<h3 id="c196">怎樣研究哲學（五） <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴以霖</p>
<p>王特夫著三江書店發行</p>
<p>七·研究的進行步驟：研究哲學的步驟，應當首先從槪括的一般的抽象的問題研究起，就是說從認識倫和認識的方法問題研究起這是哲學本部的研究。因爲哲學原是在吸收特殊的科學的成果以建業自己的基礎，充實自己的內容的，所以它的研究就必須由槪括的一般的抽象研究，而進入於特殊的具體的研究。但哲學的研究僅以胚體的特殊的事物之研究為一　研究的過程，它必須要由具體的個別問題的研究，再回到一般的槪括的抽象的研究；在各種部分的現實的事物的研究中，抽象出一般的槪括的法則來，並在這裏作成能共通於全宇宙之普遍的發展的總的結論，就是搆成一個總的宇宙觀。此外，對於哲學中之各種學說型的研究，亦應採取那樣的進程和路綫的。總之，無論是研究哲學問題本身上，或者研究哲學之各種學說型上，都得採那由槪括和一般的抽象研究，到特殊和具體的研究，再到槪括的和抽象研究的方法。這種回復並不是簡單的回歸，而是向高級的發展階段邁進的研究方法，這是辯證的研究法。</p>
<h3 id="c197">袁昌英的孔雀東南飛及其他 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 風</p>
<p>孔雀東南飛</p>
<p>（一）創作動機與寫作態度</p>
<p>以古詩孔雀東南飛蘭芝與仲卿的婚姻悲劇作劇本題材的，早在十四年前，新中華戲劇協社發行的戲劇，卽刋有五幕劇孔雀東南飛，爲北京女子高等師範學校國文部四年級生的集體創作。商務本，袁昌英的孔雀東南飛及其他獨幕劇，寫作於十作年，而於七九年印出問世的。與此同時，尙有熊佛西的蘭芝與仲卿獨幕劇。同一題材，而劇作者的創作親點未必也盡相同，是事實，關於此點，以及各劇技巧手法等，當另爲文論及。</p>
<p>至於袁氏本人創作此劇的中心觀點，在序言一裏，她自己已經明白說出：</p>
<p>「……我學得人與人的關係，總有一種心理作用的背景。焦母之嫌蘭芝自然是一種心理作用。由我個人的閱歷及日常見聞所及，我猜度一班婆媳之不睦，多半是「吃醋」二字。我並不是說母親與兒子有什麽暗昧的行爲才對媳婦吃醋的。……假使遇着年紀還輕，性情劇烈而不幸又是寡婦的，這仲卿與蘭芝的悲劇就不免發生了。」</p>
<p>一般寫家庭悲劇的作者，大都偏重於命運，家庭悲劇，是人同命運抗鬥出來的。袁氏寫作孔雀東南飛能夠掃除這種成見，別創出心理作用的見解，確是認識深遠。基於這個觀點，作者更耗去絕大的努力，研究當時的社會習俗，以期達到完滿成功，這精神，尤足稱道。因爲新的嘗試，能抱不苟且不草率的態度，殊不多得。這在寫本文時應特別提出的。</p>
<p>（二）每幕梗槪</p>
<p>全劇分三幕</p>
<p>第一幕　未婚前的仲卿，因思念蘭芝而致病。母一意以慈愛撫慰，鄰姥來談，勸母速與子完姻以冲喜，母披露心事，恐子娶婦後，將置寡母於腦後，適媒婆來，力促完姻，仲卿聞喜訊，霍然而愈。寫出寡母愛子，嫉視未來媳婦之地位的因子。</p>
<p>第二幕　蘭芝婚後，夫妻情怡，而不得母原諒，日遭毒罵，過份勞作，均忍受無怨言，母卒不令安之於室，怒子愛妻甚過孝母，卒遣出蘭芝回母家。</p>
<p>第三幕　路傍郊外景，蘭芝再嫁訊來，被逼與仲卿同盡，母陷瘋癎。而完成人間一大悲劇。</p>
<p>（三）人物</p>
<p>固有的幾個人物在此地是沒有多大增減的。計：</p>
<p>「焦母　姥姥</p>
<p>蘭芝　媒婆</p>
<p>仲卿　花兒</p>
<p>小妋　使女」</p>
<p>角色已達到最經濟的地步，當然，經濟在某些劇作裏反而是有害的存在。</p>

<p>海倦了，像一隻兇猛的雄獅，把狂吼收斂起來，平息了它的憤怒，在微風裏沉睡了。</p>
<p>誰知道它要睡多久，明天的這時，海面是夢一般的微笑？是憤怒的在吼？</p>
<p>舟子揚起帆來，倚了船身，把一天的辛苦，都從烟斗的細烟裏，輕輕噴出。</p>
<p>更遠是白雲，故鄉還在白雲之外，那裏有自己的妻子和幼兒，那夢和希望的搖籃。</p>
<p>生活裏沒有愁鬱，有的，只是汗和浪花的交織，誰有史多的空閑，來作遙遠的懷思？</p>
<p>設若背膀能長出雙翼，不也可跟海鷗樣自由飛去！</p>
<p>嬝嬝地烟，烟外是迷漫着灰色的霧，在燈塔的那邊，是島？是無窮的藍色的海水？還是渴念着的陸地？</p>

<p>— 作榮</p>
<p>火車載着我們到了泰安，是那末迢遠的長途。人力車，步行，很費勁地這才到了上山的正路。</p>
<p>是春天的時候：地上平舖着綠油油的嫩草，還有長得很整齊的麥苗：風和緩地吹來，牠們會起着水般的微波，怪使人愛的。樹木都呈露出新的恣態，活潑潑地氣象告訴人牠們是在冬底懷抱里淸醒過來了。山色是很美麗的，使人想到人家說的泰山怎樣好，怎樣好，一點兒也不誇張。</p>
<p>弟弟走上一天門就連蹦帶跳地跑了起來，可是被我扯拉住了。他不高興，獗起了嘴來。</p>
<p>走過幾棵老彎了腰的松樹，杏樹就密密地在路旁生長着了。仲春天氣正是花底靑春階段——燦爛地開着花，蝴蝶，蜜蜂成羣的在花叢里飛舞，把整個的天地襯飾成詩的畫面。</p>
<p>「走啊，你們不走，我可要跑了……」</p>
<p>弟弟說着就要從我手里掙扎出來－－跑，我們也只好走了。他眞有些氣人，一個勁地跳躍着，彷彿他來自己也不知道是要幹什麼！看這個閙着走，瞧那個他也閙着走，看那坐化成了仙人——乾巴骨頭，假頭弄成的那孫眞人，他卻來了興頭了，不祇不閙走，兩隻眼睛直勾勾地呆瞧起來了——不是人家道士在那里看着的話，他眞會立直起脚來摸弄一下的。</p>
<p>雲步橋下邊的瀑布，可眞是張很美麗的畫面，水不斷地從上而下的流，銀鍊似地白。有時流得過激了，飛濺起來的水星，就彷彿是銀屑般的。有光也有聲，使人在那裏會迷茫起來。</p>
<p>一道上，呌錢的小孩——有男的，也有女的，都是八九歲的年紀，跟在屁股後邊老是要錢，扯着那土笨的泰安腔調，喊出熟練的話。</p>
<p>「給個錢吧，少爺，姑娘呵！給個錢……」</p>
<p>妹妹和弟弟也跟着喊了起來，學的很像，連那討錢的小孩也笑了。</p>
<p>南天門像座寺院，坐落在天上般地高得出奇，讓人看了先就犯愁——「十八盤」是何等地難走啊！路，一條陡立的石階路，天梯般的矗立着。使人想到：「這無怪乎呌作天門啊」！</p>
<p>在那門口掛着小孩用來吃飯的大碗作招牌的入家，吃過了點東西，渴了壺茶，爸爸就買了些敬神用的東西，又到頂上去。</p>
<p>在泰山娘娘的廟堂裏，燒過香，爸爸叩拜了神像後，摸扶着弟弟的頭，溫柔地悄悄的說：</p>
<p>「是啊，他已經這末大了」！</p>
<p>弟弟祗是瞪着眼睛瞧望着神像，他是不明白這是爲什麽？</p>
<p>我望着弟弟笑起來——：這是泰山娘娘賜给爸爸的孩子啊！一種說不清楚的神秘的意味籠罩着我的心。</p>
<p>在那家吃飯的店裏休息的，半夜裏爸爸就把我們呌醒了。天上還掛着稀微的星星，跑到了山上。在望海石後邊的高崗上，往東邊山下呆呆地望着。四下里的山，全給烟霧的氣息瀰濛下了。風把仲春的冷氣帶到人身上，使人打起寒噤來。</p>
<p>「咱忘記帶毛氈來了，我原以爲不</p>

<h3 id="c200">教育與清高 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>敎育據說是「淸高」的事業，證之鄉下人對讀書人的尊敬，也確覺得儼然如此。旁的地方我不知道，不過在上海，我却覺得「淸高」這兩個字，祇少該打個折扣，原因呢，倒並不在乎上海是個文化中心，讀書人受人尊敬的地方太少，所以自動跌價，實實在在，倒是因爲怪象太多了，不得不跌價。</p>
<p>每逢學季開始，印着大洋房的招生廣吿是時常可以看到的，並且好像還有「週到」等字樣，這就使人很費解了；而更費解的，則是那些一樓一底的所謂「弄堂小學」，一幢一樓一底的房子，要分幾個敎室，敎員休息室，甚至也有操塲分出來，那是除了贊嘆於計算精密之外，是再也說不出其它的話來的。</p>
<p>但等到日子一久，知道得較多，釋然於那些「弄堂小學」與其呌做「小學」還不如呌做「子曰商店」來得明白爽快之至，便也轉覺得平淡了，就是對那些「學校與賭臺」的新聞，也覺得旣是「商店」，自然也理所當然。</p>
<p>不過對因爲被指爲學生，以致提起訴訟的新聞却還是不能無威的。據報載：慕時英文夜校的校長因爲「務實招生廣告刊自訴人爲其學生，載明受本校敎育後，任慕時夜校校長等字樣，但本人爲聖芳濟畢業」，於是認爲「影饗名譽事業」，提起刑事自訴，並附帶民訴一千元；對方呢，除了提出種種物證人證證明對方確是該校民十九的英文打宇班學生，並反訴誣吿之外，在狀子中還歷數「背棄師長」等大罪。</p>
<p>這事情的結果如何，是會有法庭的判决的。但在法律範圍之外，也不妨來談談做了人家的學生是否就「影饗名譽事業」？而招生廣吿中登了學生做了校長，是否也足以證明母校的成績之好？</p>
<p>做校長的大槪對一萬世師表」的孔子的話，總相當佩服的吧，那麽孔子就說過，三人行，必有我師」的話過，這可見得做學生並不就「影響名譽事業」，孔子如果生於現代，爲了需要，恐怕到慕時或務實夜校去補習英文也是說不定的。</p>
<p>至於老師是否一定比學生强呢？我記得中國也有句成語，呌做「靑出於藍而勝於藍」，可見學生就决不一定比老師沒出息，而學生的學校未必見得比母校弱，於此也可以使人放心。如果老師一定比學生好，這個世界也决不會從石器時代到現在的電氣時代了。</p>
<p>但何以一個硬要認個學生，一個硬要「背棄師長」呢？說穿了很明白，兩位校長先生都認爲：老師一定比學生高明。</p>
<p>學校旣以生意爲前提，同行相妒，「老師」學生的名義自然在所必爭，何况更有「運用誘惑手段，作種種損人利己之逆行」作導火錢乎？</p>
<p>但於此也使局外人更明瞭所謂敎育的淸高！</p>

<p>白雲底下的紅雲層裏，露出了通紅的太陽底頭頂來。那美麗極啦！太陽底光電般地伸展到整個天空。光明把宇宙占領了。弟弟高興得呌了。妹妹笑着說</p>

<p>(Zhengzhou) The National Army's Wan Yaohuang has concentrated all forces in Xianyang and established contact with Feng Qinzhai's troops, launching a large-scale encirclement and suppression of Xi'an. The Zhang rebels are extremely panicked and have sent troops to blow up the railway bridge over the Wei River between Xi'an and Xianyang, and are now confronting each other across the river. (December 23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) After Huazhou and Chishui were successively recovered, on the morning of the 23rd, the National Army and the Zhang rebel troops engaged in fierce fighting near Xiaoyi, 12 li east of Weinan, annihilating more than 200 enemy soldiers. The Longhai Railway engineering train followed up, repairing the damaged tracks at any time. (December 23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to railway news, the vanguard of the Central Army has arrived in Weinan, and the Longhai transport train can reach Weinan Station. (December 23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Madame Chiang, accompanied by Zhu Ziwen, Donald, and others, flew to Shaanxi to visit Chairman Chiang. The Songs sent a telegram to President Kong and Minister He on the night of the 22nd, reporting their safe arrival in Shaanxi. (December 23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Luo Zhuoying stated that the Zhang rebels are already heavily besieged. If Chiang is not sent back to Nanjing by the deadline, the Central Government will launch a decisive attack and has absolute confidence. (December 23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Shaanxi compatriots in Hankou sent a telegram劝to persuade Yang Hucheng to rein in at the brink of the precipice, rescue General Chiang, and lead his troops to revolt. The text says, (abridged) "In recent days, General Chiang has lost his freedom, and the entire country is filled with indignation. The people are in an uproar, and we presume you are already aware of this. We and you, sir, were comrades in the past and are also connected as fellow villagers. In both public and private matters, we dare not remain silent. We implore you to consider this: General Chiang inherited the legacy of the Premier and promoted the great cause of the revolution. He has worked tirelessly and overcome numerous obstacles to reorganize and unify the divided nation. His person is tied to the safety of the country and the survival of the nation. These facts are evident for all to see. Now that the national policies are roughly settled and the national crisis has not yet ended, it is a time for recuperation and education, a time for mobilizing against the enemy. Unexpectedly, a bolt from the blue has caused this major upheaval. The news has arrived, and we are heartbroken. Furthermore, the enemy is actively plotting against us, nibbling and devouring us, which is already proving effective. They are provoking and threatening us, preparing to attack us in the near future. Even if we unite sincerely and resist together, it may not be enough to cope with the situation. Now, we are turning our weapons against each other, engaging in internecine strife, and dividing our strength, giving the enemy an excellent opportunity. Regardless of your intentions, sir, this measure alone is enough to invite national disaster and more. This is what we must imploringly and tearfully point out from the perspective of the nation. Our Shaanxi is unfortunately suffered from repeated wars and numerous disasters, with industry and commerce in decline and the countryside bankrupt. Fortunately, the Central Government's policies have gradually extended westward, and with years of continuous reorganization, there has been a slight turnaround recently. However, the vitality has not yet been restored, and the original stability has not yet been completed. Recuperation and cultivation are even more urgent. Now, sir, you are boldly defying propriety and holding the supreme commander hostage, which will inevitably lead to expeditions from all sides and the gathering of large armies, turning the area into a wasteland again, a scene of slaughter. The survivors will once again become sacrifices. Thinking of this, how can we not be heartbroken? Sir, are you not considering the interests of the party, the nation, and the people of your hometown? This is what we must imploringly and tearfully point out from the perspective of our fellow villagers. Now, although a major mistake has been made, it is not too late to remedy it. We earnestly urge you to rein in at the brink of the precipice, confess your guilt, rescue General Chiang, and lead your troops to revolt. The Central Government has always been magnanimous, and General Chiang will surely be moved by your sincerity and grant you forgiveness, not pursuing the matter in depth. Great wisdom and great courage are decided in a moment. The merits and demerits of a thousand autumns depend on this moment. We earnestly urge you to adopt our suggestions and accept them. In this telegram, we are weeping and do not know what we are saying. Shen Cheng, Jiang Hongmo, Li Dingwu, Ju Meixuan, Ruan Jinli, and others, respectfully inform Ma Wei on behalf of the Shaanxi compatriots in Hankou." (December 23rd, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Guihua) After Wang Ying's bandit gang failed, he led his remnants to the Tumuertai area. Recently, under the orders of a certain party, he was transferred from Tumuertai to Jiabi Temple, north of Shangdu. The party ordered Wang to lead his hundreds of remnants to harass western Suiyuan.

<h3 id="e15">Acting President Kong Issued Another Announcement Yesterday; All Provinces and Cities Should Pay Attention to Public Security; People from All Walks of Life Should Settle Down and Cope Calmly <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi, acting president of the Executive Yuan, issued a notice to all provinces and cities on the 23rd, saying, (abridged) "The occurrence of the Shaanxi Incident has demonstrated the unity of the people across the country in supporting their leader. The Central Government is now actively handling the matter and hopes to resolve it as soon as possible. All administrative affairs are proceeding as usual and will not be interrupted by the temporary incident. However, stabilizing public sentiment, maintaining public security, protecting foreign nationals, and preventing evil schemes are all extremely important to the overall situation. Repeated telegrams have been sent in the past. Now that the Shaanxi Incident has not yet been quelled, the people across the country are calling for the punishment of the rebels. In addition, it is the end of the year, and winter defense is tight. If protection and prevention are slightly neglected, incidents can easily arise. There are still several matters that should be given special attention, which are listed below: (1) The Central Government and local governments are inherently one. All domestic and foreign political situations should be communicated closely to facilitate liaison and avoid isolation. Especially during this severe situation, news should be exchanged at any time. In the future, local political situations that are of greater importance should be reported in detail by the local officials for filing. The Executive Yuan will also compile political news every day and select reports to be telegraphed to local officials for timely disclosure, so that the people can hear accurate information and avoid making reckless speculation and believing rumors. If there are any inaccuracies in the news published in local newspapers and special editions, they should be corrected at any time to avoid misleading the public. (2) Young students have patriotic enthusiasm. During this sudden domestic upheaval, public sentiment is understandably indignant. Their support for their leader and loyalty to the country stem from sincerity, which is entirely consistent with the government's spirit of quelling the rebellion and supporting the endangered. In addition to praising them, we still hope that they will focus on studying as the foundation for saving the country, strive to learn, and prepare to serve the country. They should not be compelled by temporary indignation to take extreme actions that would waste their studies. Local officials should give them timely instruction to fulfill the country's intention of nurturing talents. (3) Factories and transportation agencies in various places are places where workers gather. Their patriotism is no less than that of others. We fear that unscrupulous elements may take advantage of the workers' righteousness to incite them to take inappropriate actions. This would not only cause good workers to lose their jobs but also have a significant impact on local stability. Prevention should be taken in advance to avoid accidents. (4) Merchants and people in various places often take advantage of opportunities to manipulate prices. However, during the recent Shaanxi Incident, the Shanghai market remained as stable as usual, which shows that our merchants and people are able to consider the overall situation. However, food and other daily necessities, which are of great importance to the livelihoods of ordinary people, should not be raised in price. This should be investigated and punished at any time to maintain the market and stabilize the people's livelihood. (5) In recent years, the countryside has declined, and the lives of farmers have been very difficult. This year, the Southeast is fertile, but the northern provinces have reported disasters and requested relief. Although the Central Government has allocated funds for disaster relief, during this cold winter season, relief and comfort still rely on local authorities to find ways to implement them conscientiously. In addition, now that it is between farming seasons, and spring plowing has not yet arrived, farmers should be ordered to engage in baojia training and farmland irrigation projects, which can not only strengthen the people's self-defense but also increase agricultural production. At this time of domestic and foreign troubles, we should unite in spirit and make a common effort. During this incident, the people of the whole country were able to work with the government with one heart and one mind and respond calmly. This kind of national patriotic spirit is a manifestation of national revival. Local officials have assisted the central government and defended their localities, which is commendable. We hope that you will continue to work hard and make joint efforts to save the situation. This is what we hope for. Please act accordingly. Kong Xiangxi (sealed)."

At this moment, the nation and the people are in imminent danger. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang has worked hard for ten years and inspected the four borders, and the unification has been completed. We hoped for collective efforts to complete domestic construction and resist foreign aggression, so as to achieve the glorious survival of the nation and the people. Unexpectedly, the Xi'an Incident occurred, and the rebel Zhang Xueliang rebelled in Shaanxi, kidnapped the commander-in-chief, and shook the foundation of the nation. This has caused me, residing on the border, to witness and feel heartbroken, and I must inform the people of the whole country. Tibet is located in a remote and desolate area, isolated for twenty years. However, the reason why the Central Government is able to communicate with it today is only because the Dalai Lama knelt down to welcome Chairman Chiang's letter of instruction. The reason why I can temporarily maintain the status quo here is only because the Tibetan people deeply admire Chairman Chiang's authority and virtue. During my three years of residing in Tibet, every time I heard a bad news from the mainland, I would feel heartbroken. Now, Zhang's rebellion and armed forces are a major change. Chairman Chiang's difficulties are not rumors. Hearing about it makes me feel sad and painful. This is enough to show that the safety and security of our nation and people depends entirely on Chairman Chiang. However, I am stranded in a foreign land, watching the difficulties of the times with sorrow, and the stimulation is deep, and the feeling is acute, which is indeed greater than that of my compatriots in the mainland. I only pray that the people of the whole country will unanimously rescue Chairman Chiang and condemn the rebels. The nation and the people will greatly benefit from it. I send this telegram with tears, looking forward to your hard work." From Chiang Zhiyue. (22nd) (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>To All Newspapers:</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident has swept away the moral code, and the strong enemy is encroaching. The crisis of peril is imminent. All Chinese people are deeply saddened and indignant. Xi Hou and others have sent telegrams, which we hope you have considered. Since the establishment of the National Government, ten years of efforts have achieved preliminary success in unification. We hope that we can pool our efforts to complete domestic construction and resist the aggression of strong neighbors, so as to achieve the glory and survival of the country and the nation. However, the Xi'an Incident has destroyed the unification and weakened the national strength. Ten years of work has been wasted. Weakening ourselves and strengthening the enemy is very sad. We believe that in order to survive in today's serious national crisis, national strength must be protected, national integrity must be maintained, the entire national structure must be complete, and the leader who leads the people must be jointly supported. Xi Hou and others respectfully lead the partial army under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Liu, with the goal of supporting the Central Government and defending the country against foreign aggression. Recently, we read the four points proposed in Commander-in-Chief Liu's skillful telegram, and Xi Hou and others believe that they are the key to saving the current situation. We pledge to work together with all military and political colleagues in the country to complete the great plan of saving the country. In addition to telegraphing Commander-in-Chief Liu, we also telegram Zhang and Yang to urge them to quickly awaken and restore the leader's freedom, so that he can complete the unfinished work of saving the country, and seek the understanding of the people. We specially send a telegram to inform you, and we hope you will consider it. Corps Commanders Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Sun Zhen, Li Jiayu, Tang Shizun, Gan Zanxu, Pan Wenhua, bow at Chen.</p>

<h3 id="e54">An Overview of Japan's Finances in 1937 (1) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>(1) Characteristics of the Budget Bill</p>
<p>Japan's budget bill for 1937 has been passed in the budget cabinet meeting. The total amount is 3.41 billion yuan, which is an unprecedentedly large budget for Japan. If this budget is compared with the budget for 1936, the revenue side will increase by 736 million yuan, and the expenditure side will increase by 730 million yuan. If compared with the budget for 1931, it has exceeded more than double the amount.</p>
<p>Summarizing the characteristics of this budget bill, the following items can be obtained:</p>
<p>(1) Military expenditure accounts for 1.4 billion yuan, indicating an unprecedented expansion.</p>
<p>(2) A new system of adjusting and delivering local finances is established.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to implementing general tax increases, tobacco price increases, postal price increases, postal savings interest reductions, and increased tariffs will also be implemented.</p>
<p>(4) Abandoning the Takahashi former Finance Minister's policy of gradually reducing public debt, the policy of increasing public debt issuance is adopted, stipulating a plan to issue nearly 1 billion yuan of public debt.</p>
<p>(2) The So-called Renewal of Administrative Policies by the Hirota Cabinet</p>
<p>When Guang Tian formed a cabinet, he once chanted the slogan of renewing administrative policies. This slogan is still an unfulfilled check to this day. Therefore, the main reasons why Japan's budget bill for 1937 shows unprecedented expansion are: first, due to the current international situation, the importance of national defense is felt, and a huge amount of funds must be used to enrich national defense; second, it is also to implement the current cabinet's important national policies. The current cabinet's important national policy purchase fee, according to the Japanese government, has the following items: (unit: one million yuan</p>
<p>(1) Enrichment of national defense. 691</p>
<p>(2) Refreshing and improving education.</p>
<p>(3) Consolidation of the central and local tax systems. 237</p>
<p>(4) Stability of national cattle life: 53</p>
<p>(1) Disaster prevention equipment. 19</p>
<p>(2) Expansion of health care facilities. 9</p>
<p>(3) Revival of the rural and fishing village economy, and revitalization of small and medium-sized commercial industries, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e55">How to Consolidate the Economic Foundation <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, our country's economic organization has been able to maintain its security, which is very gratifying. However, this should be attributed to the success of financial control. And whether finance can be stable depends even more on whether prices are stable. Prices in our country often fluctuate greatly due to slight differences between supply and demand. This is the case in peacetime, and it may be even worse in extraordinary times. The goods in the domestic market have lost their regulation. If there is a surplus, they cannot be stored and allowed to leak out and rot internally. If there is a shortage, there is no ability to seek widely from the outside to prepare for any eventuality. Therefore, we are not worried about excess, but we are worried about inadequacy. Shallow vessels are easy to overturn and the danger increases. For example, recently cement has had to be sought from Japanese goods because of the urgent demand for construction projects. If something happens in the north, the source of coal will be slightly blocked, and the cry of coal shortage will fill the ears. The price of coal has risen one after another. Food is the source of life. In recent years, the depth of speculation is no different from yarn and cotton, but there is no effective regulatory strategy. For example, the Guangdong Province's request to exempt the foreign rice tax is not allowed in the environment where the local rice is said to have a bumper harvest, but the rice of Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi can meet the needs of the people of Guangdong Province. If this is not planned, and we only blame those who enter for not buying foreign rice, how can we satisfy the expectations of the people of Guangdong? Also, the opening of highways is becoming more widespread, but the demand for automobiles and gasoline cannot be met by ourselves. Once the supply is cut off, the highways will be as good as nothing. Even if the management of exchange rates is successful, if trade is not controlled and remains the same, its effect will not be obvious. All of the above are necessary steps to consolidate the economic foundation, and it cannot be achieved overnight. But the changes in the world are so drastic. Is there still room for us to wait and see?</p>
<p>Moreover, since the establishment of the Anglo-American-French agreement, the possibility of international monetary stability is greater than before. The American Peace Conference has closed. The United States' proposal to reduce tariff barriers and allow American countries to enjoy equal trading opportunities has also been passed. In Europe, there is also a high call for the abolition of tariff barriers. The international economic world will undergo many changes in the future, and how we, as a member of the international economy, should deal with the environment and quickly seek self-reliance cannot be delayed.</p>

<p>Madrid. Today, a breathtaking aerial battle occurred over the Manzanares River. Thousands of spectators crowded the streets, their eyes dazzled as they looked up at the sky. Two planes from the rebel forces and two from the government forces participated in this battle, each bravely fighting the enemy with dedication. In the end, the rebel forces were victorious. One government plane was shot down, and another, riddled with machine-gun fire, was forced to land at the Barajas airfield. Before the aerial battle, the rebel forces launched a fierce artillery bombardment, with three shells hitting the tall building of the city's telegraph bureau, leaving numerous bullet holes in the walls. Several other shells landed in the nearby streets. At the same time, according to the government forces, the rebel forces repeatedly launched offensives last week but were always defeated by the government forces. The government forces even counterattacked and were victorious, recapturing areas such as the village of Boadilla del Monte on the western front of Madrid. (December 22nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid. Nationalist bombers and artillery again fiercely bombarded the capital today, causing heavy losses in the city. Nationalist fighters first attacked the northwest of the capital with bombs and machine guns, while the artillery targeted the telephone exchange. One shell hit the six-story building of the exchange, where reporters were reporting on the war situation at the time. The storage room was completely destroyed, but fortunately, there were no casualties. Another shell landed at the gate of the exchange, causing panic among the staff. Two Nationalist planes attacked the city at 2:40 PM, dropping several bombs in the northwest. Soon after, Nationalist artillery also began to fire, bombarding the center of the capital with volleys.

However, since the capital was besieged by the Nationalist forces, it can be said with certainty that the battle of Pozuelo is the most important battle in the surrounding areas.

<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle recently declared that Germany's economic difficulties are increasing daily. The country's leader, Hitler, unless he fundamentally changes his policies, must "resort to serious adventurous actions abroad." In addition, German officers serving in the Spanish Nationalist army have had disagreements with them because the Nationalist army is not good at fighting. Moreover, Germany and Italy have conflicting opinions on a Mediterranean issue. In light of this, Hitler has only two paths to follow: "One is to intensify intervention in the Spanish Civil War to an alarming and dangerous extent; the other is to admit that this costly adventurous action has failed and stop it."

<p>(London) Regarding the Spanish seaport and border monitoring plan, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist government, Franco, submitted a reply on the 19th of this month, which was forwarded to the British Foreign Office by Sir Chilton, the British Ambassador to Spain (currently in Hendaye, southern France). The content roughly stated that the Nationalist government is prepared to consider this plan, but only on the condition that the Adjustment Committee provides supplementary explanations on the following three items: (1) The main routes to Spain that should be monitored must be specified, and the Adjustment Committee should also explain whether it intends to monitor these key routes; (2) Whether the Adjustment Committee plans to confiscate weapons purchased by both sides of the Spanish Civil War using cash reserves from the Bank of Spain; (3) Whether the Adjustment Committee plans to send personnel to monitor Perpignan, Bordeaux, and Bayonne in southern France, which are the sources of recruitment and assistance for the Spanish "Red Government." The reply also stated, "The Red Government is unable to maintain order even within the areas it controls. How can it guarantee that the monitoring personnel will be able to work safely and effectively?" The conclusion stated, "The British government has failed to understand the greatness of the Spanish Nationalist movement and continues to maintain relations with the anarchists in Valencia, which is regrettable."

<p>(London) The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon, which concluded at around 8:00 PM. Judging from the progress of today's meeting, the subcommittee has not made any definite decisions on the three main issues. Therefore, discussions on intensifying the implementation of monitoring measures may have to be extended for several days, or even several weeks. The so-called three main issues are: one is the reply from the Spanish Republican government and the Nationalist authorities, in which the reply from the Nationalist authorities is equivalent to rejecting the monitoring plan. The Soviet representative, Ambassador Maisky to Britain, believed that this reply was arrogant, and the subcommittee should respond with an arrogant attitude. As a result, the subcommittee decided to send the various detailed items of the seaport and border monitoring plan to both sides of the Spanish Civil War again, requesting that they submit replies within ten days. The second is the aerial monitoring plan. Regarding this matter, the subcommittee only decided to draft another plan for review by the governments of various countries (the original plan had been rejected by Germany and Portugal). The third is the issue of volunteer soldiers from various countries going to Spain to help in the war and financial assistance for the civil war. The subcommittee only decided to establish two technical committees to study these two issues separately. Among them, regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteer soldiers from enlisting, it is known to diplomatic circles that Italy and Germany have not yet submitted replies. (December 22nd, Havas)</p>

These talks are currently continuing through diplomatic channels, from now until the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council on January 18 next year, when a final decision will be made on this issue. It is reported that during the talks between France and Turkey, the Turkish side maintained its original viewpoint, namely, that the cities of Alexandrette and Antioch should be separated from Syrian territory and become independent countries, the same as Syria and Lebanon. The French side considers this unacceptable, as such a method would inevitably lead to the division of Syrian territory, and the treaties that France has signed separately with the governments of Syria and Lebanon would be damaged as a result. However, France is prepared to enhance the protection of the rights of Turkish ethnic minorities in the cities of Alexandrette and Antioch. Therefore, there is a clear difference of opinion between France and Turkey. Today, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüşdü received instructions from his government, ordering him to continue to use the separation of the two cities from Syria as the basis for negotiations. Therefore, the French and Turkish sides believe that it would be better to wait until Rüşdü returns to his country before continuing the talks. However, both sides stated that the friendly relations between France and Turkey are close and uninterrupted, and will not be affected by occasional differences of opinion on this issue.

<p>Oslo. It was officially announced here today that the Russian revolutionary Trotsky, who had been exiled here, boarded the "Ruth" steamship last Saturday for Mexico. Since being expelled from Russia, Trotsky has traveled extensively throughout Europe, such as the island of Prinkipo in the Sea of Marmara in Turkey, the Czech Republic, France, and Denmark. He finally came to Norway. The Soviet Russian government has repeatedly protested to Norway. Norway initially ignored it, but now finally ordered him to leave the country. The Mexican government then invited him to Mexico, but many workers' organizations in Mexico have raised objections. (December 22nd, Guomin News)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce reported that a Soviet purchasing representative has purchased 40 tons of tung tree seeds in the United States to increase the Soviet Union's tung tree production. It is said that over the past three years, the Soviet Union has purchased 66 tons of tung tree seeds, enough to plant 100,000 mu of tung trees. It can be seen that the Soviet Union is preparing to compete with China in tung oil production. (December 22nd, Guomin News)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Japanese Foreign Minister Explains Diplomacy Towards China and Russia to the Privy Council: No Way to Predict the Xi'an Incident at Present: Negotiations with Russia to Extend the Current Fishery Agreement <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the briefing and discussion meeting held by Foreign Minister Arita at the Privy Council on the issues of the Soviet Union and China, it was held in the rest room of the Imperial Palace on the morning of the 23rd. Privy Council Vice-Presidents Hiruma and Arai and other advisors and Chief Secretary Murakami entered the palace at 10:00 AM to attend to imperial affairs, then gathered in the rest room. On the government side, Foreign Minister Arita attended, first reporting on the progress of negotiations on the signing of the Japan-Soviet Fishery Treaty. It was decided that regarding the Fishery Treaty, although the Foreign Ministry ordered Ambassador Shigemitsu to do his utmost to negotiate its signing, the Soviet side refused to sign it on the grounds of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. It was unavoidable to extend the existing treaty for one year, and negotiations would continue during that period. There was a general consensus on this matter. The details are currently under negotiation. Once they are settled, a request will be made to consult the Privy Council, hoping for understanding. It was also explained about the progress of the Xi'an Incident and the Imperial Government's policy on this matter. Then, advisors such as Ishii, Kawai, Arima, Ishizuka, Motoda, and Kuroda raised questions one after another, namely:</p>
<p>(1) The Fishery Treaty is far from expectations, and the Soviet Union refuses to sign it. Can the new treaty be signed during the extended period of the current treaty, or will the treaty be renegotiated from scratch?</p>
<p>(2) How will the Xi'an Incident be observed in the future?</p>
<p>(3) What is our country's policy towards China? Foreign Minister Arita replied one by one as follows: The government intends to continue to order the ambassador to the Soviet Union to do his utmost to negotiate and have the new treaty signed.</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident is currently completely unpredictable.</p>
<p>Finally, advisors Ishii, Kawai, and Arima expressed hopeful opinions of encouragement, saying that regarding future negotiations on the Fishery Treaty, the fundamental policy must be to uphold vested rights. Regarding the policy towards China, the Foreign Ministry should coordinate with the military and move towards a consistent policy. After speaking, the meeting adjourned.

<p>(Paris) Mrs. Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for L'Œuvre, recently declared that the gentleman's agreement that Britain and Italy are planning to conclude on the Mediterranean issue is currently under discussion. It is said that France and Italy will also conduct negotiations in the near future to conclude a similar agreement, so that this negotiation work can achieve considerable results by the time the League of Nations Administrative Council meets on January 18 next year. (December 23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Investigating reliable sources in London, it has been learned that the forecast that the discussions currently underway in Rome regarding British and Italian interests in the Mediterranean are nearing completion is not overly optimistic, but it is too early to say. It is generally believed that both sides are quite satisfied with the progress of the negotiations, but neither wants to act rashly, as the nature of this matter requires careful and thorough study. The basis of the current talks is that both sides believe that the interests of both governments in the Mediterranean need to be supplemented. The formal confirmation of this point can have real value, and both sides must first closely examine all possible sources of misunderstanding or conflict in a spirit of goodwill. Recent developments in the eastern and western Mediterranean have certainly not made the British government dare to believe that the Italian government is relieved about Britain, while making its own position clear. Although both London and Rome expect that the current exchange of views will inevitably lead to a declaration, this declaration is unlikely to be realized until a thorough study of all issues has been conducted. (December 22nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) The evening newspapers here have commented on the decision of the British and French governments to re-establish consulates-general in Addis Ababa, praising it. The well-known reporter Gaeda wrote an article in the Italian Daily, saying, "This decision is enough to ease the hearts of all parties, and the international atmosphere is also cleared as a result. The governments of Britain and France can be proud of this. The Italian people are also satisfied with this decision." The "Fascist Labor News" said, "The great achievement established by Prime Minister Mussolini's political genius has now been recognized by the world." "La Tribuna" stated, "We dare say that the restoration of friendly relations between France and Italy is most appropriate at present. It is essential to restore the relationship of trust between France and Italy, which is what the Italian people unanimously feel." (December 22nd, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newspapers have commented on the de facto recognition of the Italian Empire by the British and French governments, all saying, "This is a trend towards the reconstruction of the three-nation Stresa Front (the events of April last year)." The German General Report contrasted the situation in which the relations between Britain and France were deteriorating with the speech recently delivered by British Foreign Secretary Eden in Leamington (Eden's speech stated that if France and Belgium were attacked without provocation, Britain would provide assistance), and said that the establishment of consulates-general by Britain and France in Addis Ababa is indeed a diplomatic victory for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and there is no doubt that the situation in the Mediterranean will be eased as a result. (December 23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Austrian officials have expressed satisfaction with the fact that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have changed their embassies in Addis Ababa to consulates-general, believing that the Stresa Front (i.e., the alliance of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, the events of April last year) was previously declared broken due to the Italian-Abyssinian War, which Austria originally regretted. Now that both Britain and France have decided to establish consulates-general, their mutual relations with Italy can be eased, and the relations between the countries can be more harmonious, which Austria is fortunate to see.

<p>(London) Correspondents from various newspapers stationed in Berlin have commented on Germany's internal affairs, all saying that the country's political situation has reached a critical juncture. Either the current policy will be continued, forcing the people to practice frugality to implement a large-scale rearmament plan, or this policy will be abandoned, and negotiations will be conducted with Britain and France to conclude an agreement. Among them, the correspondent for The Times declared, "To satisfy Germany's main demands, it must fully cooperate with other countries in the economic and political spheres and abandon adventurous actions." (December 23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian recently stated that Germany's economic situation is extremely worrying. It is also possible that the country will take action in Spain, Czechoslovakia, or the Free City of Danzig, so that people's attention will no longer be focused on the domestic crisis. "We very much hope that Germany will adopt a policy that turns to peace, as the country's leader, Hitler, declared in his speech in March of this year.

The general public was very surprised to hear this, especially foreign residents, who believed that the German government had recently promulgated measures for citizen mobilization and preparedness, and strengthened defenses in the Stuttgart area on the southern Swiss border. Now, with the addition of the above regulations, it shows the aggressiveness of its preparations. (December 23rd, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Issue of Ironware Freight Charges: German-Polish Agreement. Germany Agrees to Pay Freight, Partially in Goods. <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the issue of railway freight charges for German goods passing through the Polish Corridor, which has been disputed between the two countries for a long time, the governments of Germany and Poland recently signed an agreement to resolve it. According to the agreement, Germany will pay railway freight charges, partly in foreign currency and partly in goods. It is said that the German side insists on paying part of the freight in goods due to a shortage of foreign currency. (Note: Since the European War, a corridor has been demarcated between the province of East Prussia and the western part of Germany, called the Polish Corridor. Germany previously concluded an agreement with Poland to facilitate the transit of goods, stipulating that Germany would pay Poland 3,200,000 złoty per month in Polish currency as transit fees for trains. Subsequently, Germany repeatedly defaulted on payments, claiming that its foreign currency reserves were low, and the accumulated arrears amounted to 570,000,000 złoty. In addition, this agreement was due to expire at the end of December this year, so the two sides began negotiations to settle the old debts on the one hand and establish a new payment method on the other. An agreement has now been reached.) (Havas, 22nd)</p>

Its content is as follows: (1) Strictly prohibit the transport of munitions to belligerent countries; (2) Prohibit the lending of funds to belligerent countries; (3) Prohibit American citizens from traveling on belligerent-owned ships.

<p>(London) Following the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in Cairo yesterday, the British government today appointed Sir Miles Lampson, Commissioner for Egypt and Sudan, as the second British Ambassador to Egypt. Lampson played a significant role in the completion of the treaty. After seventeen years of protracted negotiations between the two countries, the treaty was finally concluded, thus placing the relations between the two countries on a solid foundation. Since Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, a new situation has emerged in the Near East, greatly changing the situation in the Mediterranean. Egypt, because its 800-mile border with Sudan is adjacent to Italy's new territory, felt disturbed. In 1935, without consulting Sir Miles Lampson, it asked the British government to reopen the negotiations that had broken down in 1930. After the British Foreign Office agreed, it appointed Lampson to take on this task and assisted him with senior technical experts from the army, navy, and air force. After taking office, Lampson devoted himself to his duties, adapting to the needs of the situation, applying both firmness and flexibility. When Egypt made excessive demands, Lampson told them in a calm and firm manner that if the negotiations failed, there would be serious consequences, and Britain would be forced to reconsider its policy towards Egypt, so Egypt made concessions. When Egypt declared that it could make no further concessions, Lampson took a plane to London and strongly urged the Foreign Office to also make concessions to preserve the overall situation. After six months of arduous work, the treaty was finally concluded, winning the praise of the majority of the people of both Britain and Egypt. Lampson's contribution is truly indispensable, so the British government awarded him the post of Ambassador to Egypt to reward his merits. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>(London) It is generally believed that this year's Christmas celebrations are more lively than any in Britain since 1929.

<p>(London) The British Foreign Office issued formal notices to the U.S. and Japanese embassies in Britain this afternoon, stating that the British government has decided to invoke Article 21 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, the escalator clause, to retain five cruisers (totaling 21,000 tons) that have reached their service age without dismantling them. The retention period shall not exceed five years in peacetime. These cruisers will now be converted with 6-inch caliber guns for use as anti-aircraft ships. The armor on the ships will also be replaced and will no longer be suitable for long-distance ocean navigation. It is reported that the Japanese government notified the British government before the issuance of this notice that it had no objection to Britain retaining five cruisers that had reached the end of their service life. However, it is generally expected that the Japanese side will also issue a similar notice, declaring that 26,000 tons of submarines and cruisers that should be dismantled will still be retained.

<h3 id="e84">New Developments in Japan's Southern Advance Strategy: Zhongnan Joint Stock Company Established in Shantou. Will Control the Freight Business in Chaozhou and Meizhou. <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Japan's southern advance policy, with economics as the vanguard, Taiwan as the base, and the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong as the target of advance, has been proceeding very rapidly recently. As evidenced by the establishment of the Taiwan Colonization Company last month and the subsequent birth of the Shantou Zhongnan Joint Stock Company. The Shantou Zhongnan Joint Stock Company is located at the former Daito Swimming Factory on Shen Zhao Road, Qi Qiang, next to the Japanese Consulate. On the 9th of this month, Huang Xin, a Taiwanese councilor sent by the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan, arrived in Shantou to guide everything. On the 11th, Huang hosted a banquet for the Japanese consul and invited well-known Japanese and Taiwanese figures in Shantou to hold the company's inauguration ceremony at the Shantou Tao Fang Garden. It is said that the company is extraordinarily large in scale and has the intention of monopolizing the freight business in the Chaozhou and Meizhou regions. The Chaozhou and Shantou North-South port transportation, grain, seafood, Beijing confectionery, and various industry associations are extremely fearful. The company's business scope is divided into five departments: (1) Grain Department: Contracted with the Mitsubishi Company of Northeast China to transport and sell soybeans, soybean oil, peanut kernels, bean cakes, and other special products of Northeast China. All products produced by Japanese commercial factories in Northeast China will be managed and sold by Zhongnan Company; (2) Seafood Department: Dedicated to selling fresh fish, salted fish, dried fish, and all seafood products on behalf of the largest joint fishery company in Japan, the Hong Kong Penglai Fishery Company, etc.; (3) Matches and Cotton Yarn: Agents for the promotion and sale of matches produced in Northeast China by Mitsui Yangxing and cotton yarn and all textiles and artificial silk produced by Japanese yarn factories in China; (4) Sundries Department: Transport and sell all products produced by various Japanese light and heavy industrial factories; (5) Transit Department: Transport raw materials produced in various parts of China to Japan for use in Japanese factories. For example, tungsten, antimony, manganese, iron, tin, lead and other minerals, as well as rosin, Sansheng, duck and goose feathers produced in Chaozhou and Shantou are all included in the sales. The company has established a general office in Shantou and branches in Chaoan and Jieyang counties. It competes with the original scattered and unorganized Chinese businessmen with huge funds and cheap goods, and with the Taiwan Development Company as a backing and the Taiwan Bank as a support, the development of its future is not optimistic for our Chinese businessmen. In addition, the company plans to start business on New Year's Day next year and has hired Mr. Li as an agent. Li is a first-class real seller. They have also secretly sent people to Puning, Jieyang, Wuhua, Meixian and other tungsten mining production areas to investigate and purchase mineral sand, and plan to apply to the Construction Department for mining rights in the name of Chinese. On the 13th, the company and Osaka Shosen Co., Ltd. chartered three ships dedicated to transporting the company's goods back and forth between Taiwan, Xiamen, Shantou, Dalian, Yingkou, Qingdao, and Shantou. In the future, in addition to distributing the company's goods to various Japanese ships for transportation to Shantou, these three special ships will be used as assistance. From then on, the economic power of a certain country will definitely become more fierce. In addition, the company relies on three things: (1) The cost of goods shipped is low; (2) The freight of ships and fire markets is particularly favorable; (3) When goods are in Shantou, in addition to paying regular taxes to the customs, no other special taxes are paid. According to this calculation, it is difficult for Chinese businessmen to compete with the enemy, so all Chinese businessmen are discouraged by what they hear.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Repairing the Ye Pond to Commend Loyalty and Martyrdom <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Jiadong Correspondence: The county government believes that Hou Tongzeng, a martyr of this county, advocated defending the city during the Ming-Yi Dynasty transition. On the day the city was breached, he and his sons Yan and Jie died in the Ye Pond of his home and garden. The pond is located in the northwest alley of the city in front of the current county junior vocational school. The eastern half has been filled in as a flat ground, and the western half is also quite silted up. The county has specially submitted a report to the province for approval to use public funds to repair it in order to preserve the historical site and commemorate the martyrs. The pond land was originally contracted by the Fang and Lu families for grain. After hearing the news, they voluntarily donated it to the public, and the county government commended them. Construction began in the autumn and has now been completed. The pond is surrounded by a wooden fence, with iron buckets built in front and the words "Ye Pond" marked on the door. The couplet on both sides reads, "Selling hatred in the clear pond, the blue blood and cold ripples dissolve into one piece; donating life to complete the great festival, loyal ministers and filial sons each for thousands of years." It was written by County Mayor Guo Mingnian. A stone monument is erected at a distance of more than ten feet from the entrance, surrounded by stone paths. The rest of the land in the fence above the pond is planted with trees.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Wang Yingyou Has Reportedly Gone to Changchun. Many of the Pseudo-Troops in Chahar North Are Brewing Rebellion. A Certain Party Has Been Transporting Weapons for Days and Instigating Internal Crimes. <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: Since Wang Ying, who was desperate and fleeing outside the village, and his subordinates disintegrated, various parties have paid close attention to Wang's whereabouts. This is because this kind of heinous villain should be clearly punished in order to promote justice and satisfy the people. Therefore, everyone wants to find out the truth, but the opinions are divergent and there is no consensus. According to more credible sources, there are two theories: one is that Wang Ying fled back from Suibei on the 16th of this month and planned to occupy Shangdu again and try to have a later effect. When he was rejected by Yin Baoshan, the commander of Li Shousin's troops stationed in Shangdu, Wang immediately led more than 200 remnants and bandits and fought with Yin. Wang could not support himself and fled to the Batai area west of Shangdu. According to a certain military doctor of Wang who escaped from Suibei, Wang has taken a plane to Changchun to visit the highest commander of the XX Army, with some kind of intention. As for Wang's remaining troops, there are still more than 3,000 people scattered in the border areas of Chahar North and Suibei, who can be gathered. Wang went to Changchun to request the assistance of a certain party to rekindle the embers. Now, many of the pseudo-bandit troops are tired of the war and brewing rebellion, but a certain party is monitoring them extremely strictly, so it is advantageous to fight quickly. For days, a large amount of military supplies have been transported from Zhangbei to Jiabusi Temple, Nanhongjian, and Shangdu, strongly urging internal crimes. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">City Government Officials in Beijing Hold Swearing-in Ceremony to Pledge Allegiance to the Party and the Country. Mayor Ma Reports on the Xi'an Incident. <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The city government held a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week on the 21st. All officials attended, presided over by Mayor Ma. After leading the salute, he gave an impromptu report, saying, "Since Zhang Xueliang's rebellion in Xi'an, not only the people of the whole country have been angry and sad, but also all countries in the world have deeply regretted our country. Recently, Comrade Jiang Dingwen flew back to Nanjing from Xi'an and reported to the Central Committee on the ordeal suffered by Chairman Chiang. Newspapers have already recorded this. Now, I will make a brief report on the news that has not yet been published in the newspapers. Initially, Zhang Xueliang's rebel army surrounded Chairman Chiang at Huaqing Pond on the evening of January 11. By six or seven o'clock the next morning, they began a riot, attempting to harm Chairman Chiang's life. At that time, Chairman Chiang's guards tried their best to resist and protect Chairman Chiang from danger. However, with a very small number of guards resisting the rebel army's large force, they were outnumbered. Fortunately, each guard was able to disregard his own life and protect the window of Chairman Chiang's residence with his own flesh, falling one after another. Some were shot more than ten times before falling to the ground and dying. Their tragic loyalty is praiseworthy and tearful. It is rarely seen in ancient and modern China and abroad. It fully shows the guards' enthusiasm for loving their leader and the leader's virtue and prestige inspiring the people's hearts. At ten o'clock, Chairman Chiang escaped from danger and took refuge in the back mountain, but the mountain was already full of rebel troops and was eventually captured and sent to Xi'an City. All the comrades who accompanied Chairman Chiang were imprisoned in the China Travel Agency. Mr. Qian Dajun was seriously injured. Mr. Shao Yuanchong, Jiang Xiaoxian, and Xiao Naihua were even brutally killed. What is even more tragic is that the wife of Chairman Shao of the Shaanxi Provincial Government was stabbed to death with random knives, and the Director of the Xi'an Public Security Bureau was nailed to the city gate. When we look at the above situation, Zhang Xueliang's rebellion is not only to harm the leader alone, but also to harm our 400 million compatriots across the country. He does not know that the foundation of the government is already very solid. The soldiers and people of the whole country hate this kind of rebellious traitor and say that he should be killed. As for resisting Japan, why did he not speak of resistance in Shenyang, or in Shanhaiguan, or in Rehe? Therefore, his so-called resistance to Japan is nothing more than to use the name to achieve his personal gain. And what virtue does he have that can lead the people of the whole country and place the country in prosperity and strength? This rebellion will undoubtedly deal a fatal blow to the Chinese nation, which has slightly turned the tide of recovery. Recently, he specially asked Comrade Jiang Dingwen to return to Beijing because he was afraid of the Central Government's crusade and was making a delaying plan. However, from the Central Committee's position, there is no room for compromise with this kind of rebellious traitor who offends his superiors unless he escorts the national leader back to Beijing and surrenders to plead guilty. A thorough annihilation is necessary to correct the national law and to rectify party discipline. Our comrades in the rear should stabilize the people's hearts, consolidate the government, uphold Chairman Chiang's established policy, and continue to move forward. If we listen to rumors and cause trouble to ourselves, it is tantamount to helping the enemy disrupt the rear. Chairman Chiang has been in trouble in Xi'an for nine days now. Our work has not only not been interrupted, but has become more tense than before. This shows that we are organized and trained, which is incomparable to the previous warlord governments. I hope that you will all work harder during this extraordinary period. A million citizens in the capital are scheduled to hold an oath today to pledge allegiance to the party and the country and to support Chairman Chiang. I hope that all citizens will be of one mind and not say one thing and mean another. We must not only have the form of an oath. We must know that after taking the oath, our body and mind will be completely dedicated to the party and the country, even if it means going through fire and water. I hope that everyone will be determined from today onwards, work hard, save the party and the country, and rescue the leader from danger." After Mayor Ma finished his report, he immediately led all the officials to take an oath to pledge allegiance to the party and the country, implement the Three People's Principles, and support Chairman Chiang, so that the leader can safely exercise his powers and continue to lead the country to complete the great cause of resisting foreign aggression, saving the country, and restoring the people.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Black Pottery Cultural Site Discovered in Hang County. Numerous Artifacts, Dating Back to Before the Yin and Shang Dynasties. <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Shi Xinshi, a member of the West Lake Museum, recently discovered many Black Pottery cultural sites in Hang County while investigating the county's geology. The sites were found at the bottom of the pond, two meters from the surface, contained within a layer of black silt. The artifacts include pottery gui, dou, ding, bu, ping, min, basin, pan, etc., in numerous forms, all with primitive forms of Shang and Zhou bronzes. The shapes and techniques are quite exquisite, with a pitch-black luster, brittle and delicate. According to the Black Pottery cultural sites, which were first discovered at the Chengziya site in Longshan Town, Licheng, Shandong, archaeologists believe that they are an inherent culture of the ancient East and an important component of the earliest historical period of Chinese culture, dating back to before the Yin and Shang Dynasties. This culture originated on the coast of the East and gradually moved westward. It has also been discovered in the ruins of Henan, etc. Compared to the general emphasis on the external origin of ancient Chinese culture as being purely from the West, this is a great change. It has now been discovered in the South, with the evidence on the stratum and the comparison of objects, there is no distinction between high and low, it is no less than showing the traces of cultural development and communication in our ancient coastal plain area. For Zhejiang, which lacks historical materials, even more valuable material evidence has been obtained, so it makes a great contribution to academic research. According to Mr. Shi's repeated investigations in the Hang County area, the underground situation of the stratum has gradually become clear. Mr. Shi also said that the ancient cultural layers of Hang County can be roughly divided into three periods: the early period represents the Neolithic Age, with various crude stone tools, such as unperforated stone axes, stone scalpers, stone halberds, stone arrowheads, stone adzes, stone yue, and stone sickles; the middle period represents the end of the Stone-Copper Age, that is, the recently discovered Black Pottery culture, which also has stone tools, which are made with exquisite workmanship; the late period represents the Spring and Autumn Period, the Warring States Period, and the early Han Dynasty, when the culture was already fully developed, with the most prominent being the groups of pottery fragments with engraved patterns and printed patterns. There are more than 20 kinds of geometric patterns on the pottery fragments, which are distributed in three areas of Hang County. In addition to the pottery fragment groups, there are also well-known Han jade and many stone gui that have been unearthed, which are the characteristics of this period.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the West Lake Museum is currently engaged in research due to the large amount of materials obtained, and a report will be published. The actual objects such as black pottery stone tools will also be sorted and publicly displayed in the museum's history and culture department for reference by all walks of life.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the strict anti-smoking policy in this county, we have made every effort to carry out anti-smuggling work. On the 22nd, the County Public Security Bureau seized a large amount of smuggled opium, a total of 37 packages, weighing three and a half pounds, from the home of He Xiaodi, a rural woman in the east head of Xianghuaqiao Town, Second District. The woman He Xiaodi and the opium were sent to the bureau together and submitted to the Fourth Section of the county government for verification. It is heard that the smuggled opium belongs to the famous opium trafficker Chen Xingsheng, but Chen is on the run and has not been caught.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Suzhou: County Magistrate Deng Personally Urges Rent Payment <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Since the county government dispatched a large number of police officers to assist various industries in urging and pursuing the payment of land rent in various townships of this county, the rent collection work has made progress. According to county-wide statistics, the collection rate is about 50%. However, some tenants in townships such as Weiting, Xiangcheng, and Yinshan are still resisting the payment of rent. Therefore, County Magistrate Deng personally went to the townships on the 23rd to lecture the chiefs of various village towns and baojia units, ordering them to instruct the tenants to pay the rent as soon as possible, and to investigate and inquire. If there are indeed those who are able to pay but deliberately resist, he will resolutely arrest them and deal with them strictly. As for the first phase of land tax, according to regulations, the deadline was the 16th. Now, after requests for extension from various firms, the provincial government has ordered a ten-day extension, with the deadline set to the 25th. Late payments will be subject to overdue surcharges and fines.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Wuxi: Zhenxin Factory Prepares to Resume Operations <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenxin Yarn Factory, located at Taibaodun outside the West Gate, is managed by local resident Jiang Zheqing. It has suffered significant losses over the years. All of the factory's assets, totaling more than 900,000 yuan, are mortgaged to the Shanghai Bank. In addition, it also owes debts of more than 190,000 yuan to banks such as the China Bank and the Central South Bank. It suspended operations last summer because it was unable to maintain them. Subsequently, the yarn factory's situation gradually improved. After several rounds of consultations, it was still unable to resume operations. Most recently, Chairman of the Board Dai Lucen and General Manager of the Shanghai Bank Chen Guangfu repeatedly discussed the matter and came up with concrete solutions. Zou Bingwen from the Shanghai Bank and representative lawyer Qiu Fenling came to Wuxi to jointly negotiate with Qian Sunqing, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. It has been decided that: (1) After the factory resumes operations, all working capital will be advanced by the Shanghai Bank. The funds for repairing machinery, estimated at more than 110,000 yuan, will also be advanced by the Shanghai Bank. (2) The interest on the advances and old debts will be reduced to 7% per annum, a decrease of 1% from before. All profits from the factory will be used to repay the debts, and the Shanghai Bank will not share in the profits. The above measures have been formally contracted, and the Shanghai Bank has dispatched Yang Guanbei, manager of the Shanghai Great Northern Shipping Company, to Wuxi to make contact. At the same time, the county government has also received an order from the provincial government to protect the factory's resumption of operations. County Magistrate Long convened a meeting at the county government yesterday afternoon, bringing together all relevant parties to discuss the handover procedures.</p>

<p>The county government has recently received an order from the provincial government to establish a news censorship office. All important counties in the province with news organizations must uniformly censor all news items in order to unify political affairs and avoid conflicting information. In addition to the provincial capital, fourteen important counties with news organizations, including Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Changshu, will be the first to implement this. After receiving the order, the county government has transferred one staff member from the Public Security Bureau and one each from the Land Administration Bureau and the Education Bureau to assist. They are required to submit their resumes within three days and the office will be established immediately.</p>

Since the heavy rains and initial snowfall a few days ago, the water level of the Huai River has risen sharply by more than two chi [unit of measurement, roughly one-third of a meter]. Long-distance ships traveling from here to Zhengyang resumed their scheduled runs on the morning of the 22nd. Small boats from both Bengbu and Zhengyang will operate daily. Small boats from Bengbu to Wuhe in the lower reaches will also begin operating within days to facilitate merchants and travelers and benefit transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The "Popularization" Movement of Reading Materials <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondence from Beiping</p>
<p>The "popularization" movement of people's education materials has existed in the capital area for several years. However, it only truly became a trend and flourished when the Popular Reading Materials Compilation and Publication Society significantly expanded its scale this year. Despite the twists and turns and evolving developments, and although it largely relied on the painstaking support of a few scholars in terms of subjective factors, the needs of China's objective social environment in recent years have been the biggest factor in the flourishing of this movement. After the slogan of "Popularization of Literature and Art" was put forward in Shanghai around 1929 and 1930, Beiping also responded. Combined with the enlightenment spirit since the May Fourth Movement, it emerged in a different form, which is the so-called "popularization." Therefore, in spirit, the "popularization" movement in Beiping is still a continuation of the enlightenment spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement, but it appeared with a new look under the stimulation of the "popularization" movement in Shanghai. The difference between "popularization" and the enlightenment movement lies in the essence and purpose, and the difference between "popularization" and "popularization" lies in the spirit and method. If we still advocate the enlightenment movement of the "May Fourth" era today, it would be insufficient. However, those who advocate "popularization" often encounter practical conflicts and obstacles in terms of methods and spirit. Therefore, in the current situation in our country, it is necessary to pay attention to the "popularization" movement, which aims to educate the people with new content based on the spirit of enlightenment. Therefore, I have recorded the information I have gathered as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Movement to "Popularize" Reading Materials</p>
<p>The most important organization engaged in this movement is the Popular Reading Materials Compilation and Publication Society. It was established as early as five years ago, but in the past, due to lack of funds, limited personnel, and no fixed address, it was only supported by a few enthusiasts with the support of enthusiastic scholars. Its work was also limited to collecting old reading materials popular among the people, compiling and classifying them. In terms of various ballad forms alone, it is said that there are already more than one or two thousand types. In terms of publication, it only published a few publications and single volumes under the names of other cultural organizations within the scope of its capabilities, and the circulation was not wide. Since this year, the scale has gradually increased. It now has a fixed address, located at No. 7 Guanyinchang, Beiping, with more than ten rooms, and has established editing, publishing, and other departments, with a total of more than ten staff and workers. The reporter visited the society and saw that its work was very intense. Currently, the society's source of funds is still very difficult. It mainly relies on donations and subsidies from various parties. For example, Luo Jialun, president of National Central University, recently donated 500 yuan. A month or so ago, it was reported that the society had submitted a request to the Hebei-Chahar authorities for subsidies, but there has been no further news since then.</p>
<p>In addition to the Popular Reading Materials Compilation and Publication Society, the Beiping Research Institute and other cultural organizations are also enthusiastic about this "popularization" movement. There are also many individuals who are enthusiastic about supporting it.</p>
<p>(2) A Glimpse of "Popularized" People's Reading Materials</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation, the organizations and individuals engaged in the "popularization" movement are indeed considering the fact that there is a large illiterate population among our people. At the same time, given that the popularization of education and the improvement of Chinese characters are not achievable in the short term, those who want to educate the people with new knowledge, in addition to using text, can only rely on methods such as pictures, shadow plays, and ballads. However, due to funding and other limitations, the training of ballad singers and shadow play performers has only been planned so far and has not yet been implemented. The achievements so far are only in the two aspects of compiling and publishing reading materials and printing pictures.</p>
<p>More than ten kinds of reading materials have been compiled and published. Roughly speaking, periodicals such as "People's Weekly" and "Popular Knowledge" (bi-monthly) are either printed by the Popular Reading Materials Compilation and Publication Society itself or entrusted to the Shanghai Yadong Library for printing. The former uses simple language to introduce the people to various common knowledge of international and domestic politics, society, and economics, as well as knowledge of science, history, and geography. For example, in its inaugural issue, it translated a Shenyang correspondence from this newspaper on September 19 from classical Chinese into simple vernacular, so that the people who do not have the opportunity to read the newspaper can also learn about the situation of the Japanese oppression of our compatriots in the Northeast provinces, which is one example. The latter specializes in publishing systematic papers, but once it is systematically established, the text will inevitably be more profound. However, its ultimate goal is to move towards popularization. The series of books can be divided into two types, A and B. The content of the A series of books mainly focuses on common sense of natural science, common sense of social science, historical and geographical narratives, biographies of famous people, and story novels. Those already published include eight or nine kinds such as "Dayu's Selflessness," "Goujian's Revenge on Wu," and "Cao Mo's Revenge." The purpose is to replace the harmful and unsound reading materials popular among the people with this kind of reading materials, such as "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" and "The Cases of Shi Gong." The content of the B series of books is similar to that of the A series, but the style is in the form of ballads, old drama lyrics, folk songs, and ditties. More than sixty kinds have been published so far. These can be divided into (1) National Humiliation category, such as "Du Quan's Death to Defend Dujiayu," "Hu Amao Drives a Car in Huangpu," "Making a Scene at Zhaojialou," etc. (2) Social category, such as "White-Faced Ghost," etc. (3) Education category, such as "The Blind Man with Eyes," etc. (4) History and Geography category, such as "Song Zheyuan's Great Battle at Xifengkou," "The Battle of Shanghai," etc. The purpose of this series of books is to replace the more basic and also the most widely circulated unsound reading materials among the people, such as "Crying at Five Watches" and "The Prostitute's Sad Autumn." The cover and inside pages of the books are attached with many meaningful illustrations in a new style. The price is low and reprinting is not strictly prohibited. In addition to periodicals and series of books, those that appear in newspapers in the form of supplements are also common. The most notable ones are the "Popular Lecture" in this newspaper's supplement, "Folk Customs" in the Central Daily News's supplement, "Life and Education" in the Beiping Morning News, "Social Science" and "Modern Children" in the World Daily News, "Popular Forum" in the North China Daily, "Popular Education" in the Real News, "Folklore Weekly" in the People's Voice, and "Citizens' Weekly" in the New Beiping Daily, etc. Although their content, writing style, and attitude are different, the same purpose is to promote the "popularization" movement of reading materials. It is of great significance that they have appeared one after another in a new style during the flourishing of this movement.</p>
<p>In terms of paintings, considerable achievements have also been made. Although the form is still the same as the old New Year pictures, etc., not only is the content meaningful, but also the style is completely new and cannot be compared with the unsound and decadent New Year pictures of the past. Dozens of paintings have already been reprinted and are being printed. According to the content, it can be divided into (1) Historical Story category, such as "The Biography of Yue Fei," "Ban Chao Throws His Pen," etc. (2) Women's Life category, such as "Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter of Farm Women's Life," etc. (3) Children's Education category, such as "Descendants Forever," etc. (4) Public Life category, such as "Seventy-Two Trades Eight Pictures," "Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter of Farm Life," etc. (5) Drama category, such as "Killing the Family by Fishing," etc. (6) Humorous Satire and Persuasion category, such as "The Snipe and the Clam Fight," "The Story of Gambler Wang Da," etc. (7) Breaking Superstition category, such as "The God of Wealth," "The God of Longevity," "The Celestial Official," "Zhong Kui," etc. (8) Scenic Spots category, such as "Beihai and Summer Palace of Beiping," etc. (9) Patriotic Story category, such as "Yao Ruifang, the Female General of the Righteous Army" and "The Martyrdom of Cuihong Girl." Each painting is exquisitely printed, the brushwork is sophisticated, and the price is low. They are all unprecedented and can be considered meaningful. The inscriptions on each painting are particularly noteworthy. Here are a few excerpts to give a glimpse, such as the inscription on Farm Life: "Our country has 400 million people, farmers account for the majority. No one cares about the bankruptcy of the countryside, the whole country is going to be finished." Inscription on Seventy-Two Trades: "There are many businesses in the seventy-two trades, each earns money and lives their own life. Everyone is united to buy domestic goods, the country is peaceful and the people are happy." Inscription on Children's Education: "Little baby is well-born, loves to read and loves to play. Not afraid of bullets and cannons, only afraid of foreigners laughing at me." Inscription on Women's Life in Winter: "The north wind is blowing in winter, you weave cloth and she spins cotton. If all compatriots can work hard, why should the country worry about no financial resources?"</p>

<h3 id="e97">Middle School Sports Federation Cross-Country Race, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School Wins Championship, Fuzhong Wang Mingchang Wins First Place Individually <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The 7th Middle School Sports Federation Cross-Country Race was held yesterday afternoon at Shanghai Jiang Affiliated Middle School in Yangshupu. Despite the heavy snow, the athletes from each school did not shrink back and still bravely advanced, showing excellent spirit. However, Shanghai Jiang Affiliated Middle School, being the host, temporarily gave up participation due to the annual exam, as the athletes' graduation credits were involved. Therefore, only five schools, Sishang, Fushi, Fuzhong, Minli, and Guanghua, competed. A total of 39 people started, and the whole course was 3,000 meters. Starting from the school gate of Shanghai Middle School, they went east along Jungong Road until they turned back at Qiujiang Road Bridge, and returned to the starting point along the original road. The competition was quite fierce in the middle, but due to the bad weather and extremely muddy road, and the biting north wind, the speed was hindered, which had a significant impact. As a result, 38 people completed the whole course, and only one person withdrew due to injury. Wang Mingchang of Fuzhong was the first to reach the finish line in 11 minutes and 56 seconds. Guanghua won the team championship with 65 points because of the average talent, getting the 10th, 13th, 14th, and 15th places.

<p>The two games of West Qing basketball last night were both in the university group. Shanghai Jiang won Tongji by 38 to 28. The game between the two sides was quite clear. Shanghai Jiang had better cooperation and took the lead with 18 to 11. Tongji tried hard to counterattack in the second half, but ultimately failed with 17 to 20 due to lack of coordination. Then Nanjin and Nanyang took the stage. Nanjin was petite and flexible, and Xu Peisheng and Chen Lin were well-coordinated and made frequent contributions. They led by 18 to 14 in the first half. Nanyang attacked hard in the second half. Center Liu Jingfeng was burly and took advantage, but the passing lacked a goal and there were occasional mistakes. However, Wu Cheng, the two forwards, and Dong Yinchu, the defender, frequently scored, once tying the game at 37 to 37. Dong Yinchu then scored another long shot and exceeded by two points. At this time, both sides were eager to win and were extremely panicked. Nanyang added two more points, and then suffered a foul from the opponent and scored a free throw. The whistle sounded, and Nanyang won the second half with 25 to 23. The overall result was 40 to 39, and Nanjin finally regretted that Nanyang lost the penalty shot in the end. Games will be temporarily suspended from tonight due to Christmas and will continue starting on the 26th. The lineups and results of last night are recorded below:</p>

The shocking news has arrived, causing immense consternation. We have investigated and found that this rebel lost four provinces during the September 18th Incident, a crime that cannot be forgiven. Instead of attempting to atone for his crimes, he presumptuously acted on his own, colluding with the Red bandits, rebelling against his superiors, and betraying the Party and the nation. He is truly depraved and has cut himself off from the people of the country. We, in addition to leading all the Yunnan Boy Scouts to wholeheartedly support the Central Government and vowing to not coexist with the traitor, earnestly request the Central Government to swiftly investigate the rebellion, rescue the president, return him to the capital to preside over the central government, and respect the foundation of the nation. We await your orders. Respectfully submitted, the Yunnan Boy Scout Council, stamped."

<p>White lead wire is a key sales item for the Changjiang (Yangtze River) and Ningbo merchant guilds. The annual export volume is very large. Recently, the price of new lead wire in Shanghai has risen sharply, causing those who usually use new lead wire to switch to white lead wire. As a result, sales of white lead wire have become increasingly brisk. Unfortunately, no new stock has arrived, and inventories are extremely low. Consequently, prices have also risen sharply. Yesterday, sizes 16 to 20 were quoted at 11 yuan per dan, an increase of 5 jiao from before. Transactions were heard to have been opened for as many as 400 to 500 dan, and negotiations were still underway for more than 600 dan.

<h3 id="e125">Piece Goods: Approaching the End of the Year, Cotton Fabric Sales Are Universally Soft <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, fabric prices continued to fall. Although January futures rebounded by five yuan in the afternoon, it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. As the end of the year approaches, businesses are nearing closure, and money is becoming increasingly tight. As a result, fabric sales from all sources have become even more sluggish. Yesterday, sales prices for all goods were weak. Eastern fine cloth was particularly affected, with sluggish sales and weak demand. The market price fell most sharply, with each piece falling by twenty to thirty cents. For example, two-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, which had sold for a peak price of 9.80 yuan this month, is now nearing the critical point. The price drop for fine twill market cloth was slower, as factory supply was not strong and market demand was also slightly tight. Local factory fine cloth and fine twill also fell by varying amounts of twelve to thirty cents. Coarse twill and lightweight coarse cloth were able to maintain their prices due to a lack of stock. 14-pound, 16-pound, and 18-pound coarse cloth were weaker, with occasional price reductions of five to ten cents per piece. Colored cloth, direct tribute, broadcloth, flannel, and corduroy were unsustainable as inventories gradually increased, with prices falling several cents to four tenths of a yuan per piece, creating a very mixed market. Flannel saw the most dramatic drop, with 14-pound flannel falling from a high of 14 yuan to within 1-3 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Woolen Fabric Goods Becoming Increasingly Scarce <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen fabric market remained excellent. The stock of goods in Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce, and buyer demand remains strong. Winter seasonal goods such as overcoating and riding breeches are very popular and in demand. Due to the current situation and the approaching end of the lunar year, sellers are generally unwilling to extend credit, so buyers are not adding large quantities. However, small-scale transactions are quite frequent. Inland merchants continue to send letters with purchase requests. Transactions from local shoe makers and men's and women's clothing makers are still numerous. However, due to the lack of stock, buyers are sighing in disappointment. Currently, riding breeches of the 20th grade, overcoating of the 5-6 yuan grade, Kemotecs, and horsehair sleeves are difficult to obtain even with immediate cash, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Grain: Sesame Plummets, Foreign Sesame Falls Less, Spot Raw Hemp Falls 80-90 Cents <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Foreign sesame had risen sharply to 15 yuan. Since its peak, the market has been softening. After several days of silence, yesterday it finally moved. The Central Trust Bureau handled 600 tons of white sesame at a price of 14.60 yuan, a drop of 60 cents compared to the previous peak. Compared to the sharp drop in spot raw hemp, this is not as dramatic. Spot raw hemp plummeted by 80-90 cents. Yesterday, Shashi hemp opened at 11.50-11.60 yuan. Grain is sluggish because of the approaching lunar new year and the rainy and snowy conditions on the battlefront. All transactions are marked by wait-and-see attitude, so the market is particularly deserted. Total transactions in the city included more than 1,000 bags of various sesame seeds, 1,200 bags of various beans, 250 bags of black beans, more than 100 bags of mung beans, more than 100 bags of raw kernels, and 200 bags of peanuts, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Flour Industry Seeing Internal and External Divestments, Closing Accounts is Near... Market Value Too High <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw a uniform decline across all months due to foreign wheat quotations falling 50 cents to 1.00 yuan in Chicago, 90 cents in Canada, and 2 pence in Liverpool. With foreign wheat falling sharply, rumors of improved European situation and sufficient Australian wheat stocks, and internally, the approaching end of accounting and high market values, speculators inside and outside the industry uniformly divested. The market fell continuously, with not only a significant downward trend, but also many large players exiting. As a result, all months fell sharply by six, seven, or eight cents. By the afternoon session, this month saw further divestments from long positions due to the approaching close, and the market fell another two or three cents. Distant months initially rose slightly due to long positions rolling over, but remained weak due to poor sentiment. If the Australian wheat situation eases, foreign wheat may continue to decline, making it difficult for the market to remain stable, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Australian Wheat Plummets, Wheat Futures Plummet by 20 Cents <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a uniform and sharp decline across all months during the morning session. With foreign wheat quotations already falling sharply, and well-informed sources reporting that Italy and Austria were divesting wheat purchased in Australia, the situation favored short positions, resulting in a sudden surge in declines. This situation suggests that Australian wheat imports are inevitable, so trading was not very active at the opening, and prices plummeted. The current month did not open, but January fell by a significant 20 cents. February to April fell by 12 to 16 cents. By the afternoon session, the current month had opened, and the price had also fallen by 17 to 18 cents. Distant months saw some recovery due to floating covers, but overall sentiment was not as enthusiastic as the previous week. The spot wheat market saw factory demand holding back due to the sharp decline in standards, so no deliveries were seen, it is said.</p>
<p>Also, the Grain Exchange will be closed tomorrow (25th) in commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising. There will be a six-day market closure from the 20th of this month until January 4th of the 26th year. Trading will resume as usual on the 5th.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were still nearly 10,000 bags of Kehsien at Zhaoyuan, but sales of Kehsien were decreasing daily. The Kehsien group's performance was sluggish. Northern shipments were halted due to the stoppage of Shaanxi wheat. Since a large amount had already been handled in Guangdong and Fujian, there were renewed discussions of handling shipments, but no further action was taken. Moreover, everyone is focused on closing accounts for the end of the lunar year. Local traders were instead looking to sell, so the market was even more sluggish yesterday. Throughout the day, 269 bags of Jiangxi coarse rice and broken rice were opened, 171 bags of Wenzhou rice were opened, 1,300 bags of Yongjiang coarse rice were opened, and there were no other transactions. Prices also continued to fall by several cents to nearly a dime.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were a total of seven or eight sources, with a total of 16-17 thousand piculs of goods. Roughly forty sellers saw slack bag demand and handled three to four thousand bags, but retail sales were stagnant, so market conditions fell again. High-grade thin rice depreciated by one dime, mid-grade goods were slightly improved, and thick japonica rice was reduced by 10-15 cents. Later market, perhaps due to the rain, slightly stable situation. Du Yangjian lacks goods, without honor or disgrace. Foreign tip prices are higher, lower angle, the yin yuan to follow a scale.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirty-two or three boats arrived from various river sources. Sales of various goods in the market were average. White japonica rice stackers were slightly active. White japonica rice was soft again in the morning market but rallied at noon. Thin rice bag demand and sales from local merchants were both stagnant, and prices fell by another seven or eight cents to beyond a dime. Variant yuan was slightly soft. Prices of other goods were also generally weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday's public bond market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was quite busy due to futures expiring this month and short and long positions rolling over. However, the environment remained uninspiring, and sentiment was weak. Large players were also quiet on the buying side, with only rollovers taking place on the surface, so market conditions remained uncertain. Today is the last day of the month's futures, and there is still competition between long and short positions at the expiration. However, a portion of the rollovers have largely been completed, so it is unlikely that there will be any dramatic changes. During the morning opening yesterday, large players such as numbers 10 and 35 were strongly supporting the market. Class E and D bonds rose by one or two dimes to four dimes. After the tea break for Class C bonds, most of the activity was rollovers. Distant months saw small declines of five cents to one dime in Class B and A bonds.

<p>Sesame oil market conditions have been soaring since this month due to the influence of rising raw material prices, with prices rising in response. After the market opened at 26 yuan in the last ten days of last month, it once appeared to be firm due to a slight increase in supply. However, at the beginning of this month, due to frequent increases in raw material prices, quoted prices also continued to rise, but sentiment had already risen, and the market immediately increased to 26.5 yuan, then to 27 yuan. Before this week, the price of sesame had not stopped rising, so the selling intention of cargo owners became more and more firm, and local sales did not decrease slightly due to the price increase. Therefore, it has been developing section by section, from 27 to 27.5 yuan, then to 28 yuan. There have been sales of three to four thousand cans, all goods from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway section.

The exchange's standard silk price rose by 4 cents in spot prices and 2.5 cents in futures prices. However, the purchase order telegrams received by foreign firms in Shanghai yesterday did not see high increases in their limit prices. For example, the limit price of 78 points for Dachang Foreign Company's white factory was only 730 yuan, a difference of 20 yuan from Shanghai. The holding price of re-reeled silk at 78 points is estimated to be at 770 yuan, which is an even greater difference from overseas prices.

<p>Dr. Zheng Tianxi, the newly appointed Chinese judge to the International Court of Justice, originally planned to depart for his post at the beginning of next year after being elected. However, due to an urgent telegram from the International Court of Justice, he advanced his departure to yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., accompanying his wife and children, a total of four people, on the German postal ship "Hoxter" to The Hague.</p>
<p>Sending Off Party</p>
<p>The ship was originally docked on the river surface at pontoons No. 11 and No. 12.

<p>Remarks Before Departure</p>
<p>Before departing, Zheng told reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency that the International Court of Justice is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on February 1 next year, which is the official start of the annual court term. Because I followed the urging telegram, I specifically advanced my departure so that I could arrive before the term. I plan to take office on the same day. The term of the International Court of Justice judge is nine years. I am filling the vacancy left by Mr. Wang Liangchou, and there are still three years and ten months remaining. At that time, the terms of all judges will expire and they must all be re-elected. I will still be a candidate. Zheng then spoke about the Xi'an Incident with great indignation, saying that foreigners used to ridicule our country as a heap of loose sand. Since the realization of unification in recent months, they have looked at us with different eyes, and our international status has increased a lot. Unexpectedly, the Xi'an Incident suddenly occurred, which is very painful. For the sake of our country's future, we deeply hope that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will regain his freedom as soon as possible and turn danger into safety. Otherwise, the international perception that has just improved will inevitably change again.</p>

I am deeply honored by your presence. Regarding the progress of participating in the Paris Exposition, I would like to report in detail. The French government has scheduled the Modern Arts and Technology International Exposition Association to be held in Paris on May 1st next year. All countries in the world have been invited to participate. Of course, our country is also on the list of invitees. However, the government had previously declined for various reasons. Subsequently, the World Cultural Cooperation French Association repeatedly requested China's participation, citing the extremely close and harmonious relations between China and France, with many cooperative ventures in culture. In particular, in industry and technology, there is a need for mutual contact and cooperation. Therefore, they strongly urge China to participate. At the same time, French Ambassador Naggiar came to China and spoke on this matter, believing that although the government had declined, it would be acceptable for social organizations to initiate an organization to participate. Therefore, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Jingjiang, and Minyi and others from the World Cultural Cooperation Chinese Association initiated and convened leaders from the cultural, educational, industrial, and commercial sectors, including Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Xiaolin, Qian Xinzhi, and others, and after several meetings at the World Society, everyone recognized that this matter is very important. Because Paris is a district where world cultures converge, and this grand exposition is being held, people from various countries will certainly go to visit. Now that all countries have participated, if China alone does not go, it will have implications for its international standing. Moreover, in recent years, China's various construction undertakings in culture, education, and industrial and commercial enterprises have made considerable progress, and we can take this opportunity to engage in international promotion, so that people from various countries understand the situation of the emerging China. Therefore, it was resolved that the World Cultural Cooperation Chinese Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the Bankers' Association, four groups, and leaders from the cultural, educational, industrial, and commercial sectors, would jointly organize the 'China Participation in the Paris International Exposition Association,' and elected Chu Minyi, Zhao Zhiyou, Liu Fucheng, Xie Dongfa, and Liu Xichang as representatives to form a delegation to bring cultural, educational, industrial, and commercial exhibits to France to participate, with Minyi as the chief representative, responsible for preparing everything. The organization charter and detailed rules of the delegation's office were approved. The delegation's office was established and started operating on the 15th of this month. Regarding the collection of items, we must gather the strength of the whole country to select excellent exhibits in order to win glory for the country. Because this association is international in nature and is located in Paris, the largest and most prosperous city in the world, it is truly related to the national image and must be done with utmost dedication. Therefore, following the example of participating in the Belgian Centennial Independence Exposition in 1930, we organized the Product Collection Committee and appointed you all as Product Collection Committee members. You are all leaders in the cultural, industrial, and commercial sectors and must have great wisdom and scholarship for our reference. Therefore, today we ask you to carefully discuss it, and we hope that you will not hesitate to give your advice. After holding the inaugural meeting of the Product Collection Committee today, we will begin to collect items. We urge everyone to enthusiastically help and select exquisite items for the competition. However, one thing I would like to ask you to pay attention to is to focus on the quality of the items, not the quantity. In other words, the items are not about quantity, but about quality. I feel that the financial abundance and economic strength of a country are entirely dependent on its trade surplus and trade deficit. Therefore, internally, we must promote domestic goods, and externally, we must especially promote international trade. All of you present are leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors and have certainly already understood this principle. China has had many emerging industries in recent years. How should we promote international trade? I believe that this is an excellent opportunity. We must do our best to promote it externally, so that foreigners understand the extent to which our domestic goods have progressed in recent years and adopt them accordingly. Because various domestic goods are transported to the exposition for display, foreigners will see that China has items that foreign countries do not have, or are inferior to. Then they will know that buying our goods will increase international trade. Therefore, participating in international expositions is not only related to the national image, but is actually of great benefit to promoting domestic goods and developing industrial and commercial enterprises. I have managed expositions several times, including the last one, such as participating in the Belgian Centennial Independence Exposition in 1930, and the awards we received ranked third among all countries. Although not a perfect achievement, we still won international honor. In particular, we provided special protection to the exhibits of all sectors, such as round-trip insurance and venue insurance. We spared no effort in doing what should be done. Therefore, the exhibitors at that exposition all received awards and benefits. After the exhibits were sold at the venue, the sale price was returned, otherwise the original items were returned. Therefore, the exhibitors did not suffer any loss. This time, we will still follow the past experience and do it more seriously. As the chief representative, I will take full responsibility. All the necessary safety measures for transporting items and displaying them at the venue will be adopted as much as possible. I dare to predict to you that, like last time, after returning home from participating in the Paris Exposition, all the exhibitors' items will definitely not suffer the slightest loss. For various items, if they belong to those that are sold, the sale price will be returned after the sale. For those that are non-saleable or have not been sold, they will be returned to the original owner together after the closing of the exposition. Please convey this meaning to all manufacturers and industrialists. I will definitely take full responsibility. But what I would like to ask you to pay attention to is that time is very pressing and we must step up the collection. Because the conference opens on May 1st, our group's exhibits must be packed and shipped out in March. There are only two months of preparation time. Therefore, I would like to ask you to help especially. I hope that our country's international status can be increased as a result, and everything can achieve good results. Not only will I personally be grateful, but the country's future will also benefit from it.</p>

<p>Denouncing Zhang Xueliang's Crimes and Calling for His Suppression to Welcome and Protect the Commander-in-Chief. The City Party Headquarters of this city, considering that Zhang Xueliang has committed insubordination and rebellion by detaining the Commander-in-Chief, and that the Central Government has ordered a campaign of suppression, appointing He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression Army, and Liu Zhi and Gu Zhutong as the Commanders-in-Chief of the Eastern and Western Route Suppression Armies, who have all telegraphed their assumption of office and are leading troops westward with frequent reports of victories, specifically sends this telegram requesting the swift suppression of the rebellion and the welcome and protection of the Commander-in-Chief. The original telegram is recorded below: "Urgent, Military Affairs Department, Nanjing, forwarded to Commander-in-Chief He of the Suppression Army, and Commanders-in-Chief Liu and Gu, Honored Sirs, We have received your telegram. Zhang Xueliang has detained the Commander-in-Chief, committing insubordination and rebellion, an unforgivable act. You have taken command, denounced his crimes, and initiated suppression, which we have heard with great joy and admiration. We urge you to swiftly lead your troops westward, suppress the rebellion, and welcome and protect the Commander-in-Chief, to restore order and secure the Party and the nation.

We specifically telegraphed on the [illegible] day to advise the rebel to turn back and awaken, swiftly restoring Chiang Kai-shek's freedom, and telegraphed overseas Chinese to unanimously urge him to repent his mistakes, so that the supreme leader may escape danger as soon as possible.

We members of this Federation express our utmost support and specifically send this telegram for your consideration. Respectfully, Overseas Chinese Federation, [illegible]."</p>

<h3 id="e145">Su Gongwang Discusses the Production and Sale of Gas Masks: Private National Defense Industry Should Be Supported and Cherished, But Must Be Controlled to Avoid Various Abuses <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Air Defense Association has been publishing notices in various newspapers in this city in recent days, warning citizens to pay attention to selecting and purchasing gas masks. A reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday interviewed Su Gongwang, the Secretary-General of the Association, who stated the following:</p>
<p>According to Mr. Su</p>
<p>Gas masks are originally useful tools for defending against the enemy's use of poison gas during air raids. Therefore, manufacturers must strive for excellent quality of materials and pay particular attention to technology, so that the products manufactured can indeed defend against poison gas during air raids and not cause mistakes. However, it has been found that the gas masks currently manufactured in our country, in addition to those supervised by the government authorities, also include quite a few that are automatically manufactured and sold by other manufacturers. It is not known whether they can meet the requirements of defending against poison gas, because they have never been controlled or inspected. If the effectiveness of use is considered, there is really no certainty. If this kind of bad phenomenon is allowed to continue to spread, the danger to the future of poison gas prevention will be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Our Association is Responsible</p>
<p>for promoting air defense in Shanghai, and poison gas prevention is one aspect of air defense tasks. Seeing such a bad phenomenon occurring in the manufacture and sale of gas masks, if we remain silent, we will feel that we have failed in our mission. Therefore, in recent days, in addition to submitting a request to the municipal government, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Military Affairs, to quickly devise effective measures to ban it, we have also published notices in the newspapers to awaken people's attention, hoping that when purchasing gas masks, they will make careful and meticulous selections, so as to avoid wasting money now and not obtaining safety guarantees in the future. We also hope that if people encounter difficulties, they can come to our Association for inquiries, and we will sincerely provide detailed instructions. Furthermore, our Association has</p>
<p>Several Opinions on Gas Masks, which we plan to suggest to the Central Government for adoption. For example, gas masks currently manufactured in our country under the supervision of government authorities cost about twelve yuan per set, which is still a bit expensive. It is best to find ways to reduce costs within the possible range and sell them at low prices, so that people will be happy to buy them and easily equip themselves. In this way, both purchasing power can be increased and popularization among the people can be achieved, which will make it easier to enhance the nation's and society's ability to prevent poison gas, and the relationship is very close. Also, it has been found that</p>
<p>There are Many Kinds of Poison Gas, which are known to the world, including lachrymatory, asphyxiating, vesicant, sneezing, and toxic, among others. These were all invented around 1914 and were used during the World War. Although we must guard against them, scientific progress in the world is rapid. It has been twenty years since the European War, so progress in poison gas research is inevitable. Moreover, in the current stage, countries are competing to replenish their military equipment and improve their weapons, and they must have made new inventions in the manufacture of poison gas. However, because of military secrets, it is impossible to know. However, for the sake of prevention, we must pay serious attention to it and improve the defense weapons, such as gas masks, as much as possible, striving for perfection, so as to be able to cope with it. In short, the current world can be said to be a</p>
<p>Scientific World. Everything new and progressive has been baptized by science. We must do things according to scientific methods in order to be reasonable. The issue of gas masks is no exception. Therefore, in terms of manufacturing, we must apply scientific methods, vigorously research, and catch up to meet practical needs. In terms of promotion, we must also apply scientific methods, first conducting investigations, statistics, and overall planning, and properly allocating them to achieve popularization. For manufacturers who automatically manufacture, on the one hand, we should cherish them to foster the development of private national defense industries, and on the other hand, we should control them and conduct strict inspections to prevent unscrupulous merchants from imitating and manufacturing crudely, wasting people's wealth without helping practical use. However, this matter is of great importance and should be given close attention by the government authorities, who should advocate and supervise it and formulate an overall plan to facilitate progress. Mr. Su also said that this matter is very important to the future of the nation and society, and he sincerely hopes that the press will provide more assistance and widely promote and guide it.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Authorities Repairing the Jiangnan Seawall: Work Has Already Started Within the City Area; Work Within the Provincial Area Is Scheduled to Begin on Time <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall project is of great importance to the safety of residents in the coastal counties of Jiangnan. Therefore, the government authorities are sparing no effort to repair the seawall. The Gaoqiao Seawall within the scope of this city is currently being repaired by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works in conjunction with the Labor Service Committee. Because the seawall is relatively short, it can be completed in a short period of time. The seawall within the Jiangsu Province is more than 30,000 zhang long. The seawall in Shishan and Songjiang is more prone to damage due to the large tides, so repairs are even more urgent. This time, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, despite the scarcity of funds, has raised funds for the sake of the safety of residents in dozens of counties in Jiangnan and decided to start a large-scale repair project on March 1 next year. It is estimated that the Longjiang Temple, Jinshan Mouth, and Toutumiao sections of Songjiang need 4,233 cubic meters of stone and 1,627 wooden piles; the Shidong and Chuchengjing sections of Baoshan need 913 cubic meters of stone and 442 wooden piles; the Daotangmiao section of Taicang needs 1,822 cubic meters of stone and 1,082 wooden piles; and the Xuliujingkou section of Changshu needs 3,445 cubic meters of stone and 2,821 wooden piles. The stone used is all Xueshan stone from Songjiang, and the wood is Jian wood, which is durable. Currently, the transportation of stones is a major project, so the Gongxing Company, which is responsible for the stones, has begun transportation. It is expected that the project will be completed in the summer of next year.</p>

<p>The "North China Daily News" stated, "Foreigners in this city received a private letter from Xi'an yesterday (22nd). The letter was only one page long and the wording was very simple. It stated, 'All the people including those connected to Sanyuan (people in the church across the river) are safe. No foreigners except one or two Germans were injured. Mr. Wen Chu (dentist), a German, was killed, and Mr. Fries was beaten. There is no anti-foreignism here except for the Japanese and Germans. All the Japanese have left the country. If the situation worsens, we hope there will be an aircraft to take us out of the country. We have not yet received a notification from the consulate. If Shaanxi is defeated, Yang Hucheng may loot, but Zhang Xueliang may not do this.' The letter also stated that since the incident occurred, letters and telegrams have been cut off. Today, this letter was sent by airplane." According to reports, the letter must have been sent to Nanjing and carried to Shanghai by a government or private plane, because it was obviously not sent by airmail. The letter also mentioned that it had snowed several times in Xi'an. As for the death of Mr. Wen Chu, the German Consulate in Shanghai was contacted yesterday afternoon, and they said that they had not yet received this news.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Intensely Promoting Drug Prohibition <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, with only a few days left until the deadline for drug prohibition, has specifically designated from yesterday (23rd) eight districts in the official district to intensify and expand the drug prohibition publicity work, and will work with the Anti-Smoking Committee to dispatch personnel to give official lectures. Yesterday's weather was cold, with dark clouds all around. By one or two o'clock in the afternoon, it was already raining and snowing. The publicity personnel dispatched by the Bureau still adhered to the designated districts and set off separately to give lectures with particular enthusiasm. The area around the old north gate of the West Gate of this city is a prosperous area for opium and drugs. Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the Bureau's Anti-Smoking Section, personally supervised the investigators and went to give lectures. In the areas of the other seven branch bureaus in the city center and North Station, the four section chiefs of the Bureau's Anti-Smoking Section led personnel separately to carry out publicity work.</p>

<h3 id="e155">First Snow in This City <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The climate in this city warmed up once last week, but has gradually become colder in recent days. As a result, prices of vegetables and other items have soared, and all kinds of diseases have also multiplied due to the dry weather, especially throat diseases. Since yesterday morning, the climate has changed again, with the cold wind piercing to the bone and a gloomy and unclouded atmosphere. At about ten o'clock, it started to rain lightly, but it was intermittent. At noon, it changed to snow pellets, but stopped soon, and the drizzle continued to fall. At about 2:10 in the afternoon, it changed to snow again, sparse but not dense. At about four o'clock, it gradually became smooth and dense, like goose feathers falling from the sky. The rain stopped, so there was gradually snow accumulation between the roofs. At about seven o'clock in the afternoon, looking from a high place, the whole city was already silvery white, and the snow was still not slowing down. It only stopped snowing at about eleven o'clock. The general farmers, after this timely snow, were all beaming with joy, and all kinds of miscellaneous diseases will also be reduced as a result. However, the market price of vegetables will still be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Discovered in Xinmin Road: A Large Quantity of Obscene Books, Totaling Over Four Thousand Volumes; Two Men and Women Arrested <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around three o'clock, Wu Songshan, a detective from the Sixth Squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Corps, acting on a tip, learned that a large quantity of obscene books were being bound at No. 6 Dexing Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei. The detective immediately reported to squad leader Qian Tianxiong, who dispatched team leader Liu Bingyuan and detective Chen Mingsheng. Together with the Xinzha Branch Bureau, Wang, the bureau chief, sent Officer Wu Dichen, who was on duty, to the address. They found Yu Zichun, who was binding the books. Over ten large bundles of obscene books were seized. Along with the witness, he was taken to the team. During interrogation, Yu Zichun, 54 years old and from Zhenjiang, confessed that he made a living by binding books for others. Three or four days ago, an old woman named Chen Zhu came and said she had a large number of small books she wanted him to bind. She brought the books to his place, and he had been hiring workers to bind them for the past two days. They had already been completed but had not yet been sent out when he was arrested and brought to the case. Chen Zhu lived at No. 19 Nanxing Road, according to him. After verifying the confession, the team immediately sent officers to Nanxing Road and brought Chen Zhu in for questioning. Chen Zhu confessed that she was 51 years old, from Wuxi, and her late husband was named Chen Baisan, who had passed away more than twenty years ago. She could not make a living in Wuxi, so she came to Shanghai more than ten years ago and lived in the British Concession, at the corner of a sack, weaving cloth for a living. Later, she became acquainted with a book stall vendor from Suzhou named Chen Aqing and lived with him at No. 19 Nanxing Road for more than ten years. Her lover, Chen Aqing, also passed away last year. Currently, because she had no one to rely on, she entrusted someone to bind the many loose copies left by her late husband, intending to sell them and use the money to repay his debts. She claimed that she did not know the content of the books and was unaware that she was violating the law. After verifying the confession, the team immediately escorted her and the witness to the Xinzha Branch Bureau for disposal. The obscene books seized included "The Latest Japanese Social Romantic Photos," "Secret Records of a Licentious Country," "An Overview of Sexual Intercourse," "Special Issue on Sexual History," "Taste of Sex," "The Sexual World: School Principal and Teachers Gang Rape Female Students," "Ten Thousand Yuan Exclusively Occupies the Sisters: Civilization Sticking Hanji," "Specializing in Eating Young Men," "One Boat, Double Oars," "Female Grind," "Secret Records of the Bridal Chamber," "Tongue Battle Confuses the Cave," "Flesh Monk," "Tianjin Male Prostitute," "Secrets of Girls' School," "Pockmarked Sixth Miss," "Dangling Arm Technique," "Strange, So Strange," "One Look and Your Heart Moves, Can Be Called the Ancestor of Thieves," etc. The words were quite filthy and difficult to read to the end.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Wusong Ward Corner: Expanding Shoal, Digging a Small River; The Junchu Bureau's Haihu Dredger Completes Over a Year of Work <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The shoal along the ward corner of the Pudong Municipal Ward, across from Zhou Tang at the Wusong Yunzao Creek estuary, was quite wide and protruded significantly into the river surface, making it inconvenient for boats and sails to enter and exit. Moreover, the area was on the main route to and from a point of importance, and was also at a bend (its shape resembling the Lujiazui of this city). Therefore, incidents of ships colliding and damage, as well as dangers of capsizing, occurred from time to time. The Engineering Department of the Junchu Bureau, in view of the risks, ordered the large dredger "Haihu" to dig a small river in the middle of the shoal, so that sailboats within the capacity of one thousand dan (a unit of weight) could enter and exit from the small river, while larger steamers could navigate in the main river. This would not only facilitate merchants but also reduce the various dangers of collisions. The small river was more than a thousand feet long, with the widest part of the river surface being three hundred feet, the narrowest two hundred feet, and an average of two hundred and fifty feet. The river was eight feet deep. The "Haihu" dredger had been digging for more than a year, and the project has now been completed. Yesterday, according to Li Ahong, the owner of the "Haihu" ship, although the two ends of the small river have now been opened up, the area is a shifting sandy beach, subject to constant rising. The engineering design specified a depth of eight feet, but the rising is quite rapid. Therefore, ships with deeper drafts should pay attention when navigating in the area.</p>

<p>Revolutionary pioneer Mr. Gao Qifeng passed away on November 2nd of the 22nd year of the Republic. The Central Political Committee, chaired by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Beijing Mayor Ma Chaojun, Chu Minyi, Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Ji, Gu Zhenggang, Wang Shijie, He Xiangning, and others, specifically initiated a public funeral, scheduled for 3:00 PM today at the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road. The coffin will be moved at 4:00 PM, and the funeral procession will begin at 6:00 PM. On the 27th, he will be buried at Qixia Mountain in Nanjing. The preparatory committee published Mr. Gao's biography, stating: "On November 2nd of the 22nd year of the Republic, Mr. Gao Qifeng of Panyu passed away at the Dahua Hospital in Shanghai. Alas, with the decline of our nation's art, we have now lost this guide. This is not just a private sorrow. Mr. Gao, whose given name was Rong, was known by his courtesy name. He was orphaned at a young age, determined to study diligently. At the age of thirteen, he traveled to Japan, specializing in art, especially fond of painting. He met with Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his travels to Japan and secretly planned. He often kept a secret room full of bombs, and Mr. Gao slept on top of them for several days and nights, which awed his colleagues. After the Republic was established, Mr. Gao remained aloof from worldly affairs, not asking about politics, and devoted himself to painting. He and his colleagues ran an aesthetics library and produced photographic magazines, supporting themselves. Mr. Sun Yat-sen often praised him, saying that his diligence was unparalleled. Mr. Gao's painting skills further advanced. His paintings of landscapes, figures, birds, beasts, insects, and fish drew from various schools, integrating Chinese and foreign styles, capturing the essence of the divine, and opening up new perspectives. Knowledgeable people all praised him. Qiu Canghai presented him with a poem, saying, 'Returning from across the sea, China is about to change; with a stroke of the brush, he creates wondrous things,' which is a true record. In the 7th year of the Republic, he returned to teach and lecture, with as many as several thousand students following him. He had many outstanding disciples. In the 14th year of the Republic, Lingnan University hired him as a professor of aesthetics, and also gifted land to build a residence, which was unprecedented. The following year, the National Government built the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou, with grand regulations. They asked Mr. Gao to use his paintings of sea eagles, white horses, and lions as decorations, paying him handsomely from the national treasury. All three had been praised by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who considered them representative of the revolutionary spirit and possessing the beauty of the new era. Mr. Gao did not engage in production, nor did he seek fame. He solely devoted himself to painting and taught tirelessly. His health was weak and he was prone to illness, but he did not rest. Among his students, only Zhang Kunyi took on the role of nurse, attending to him with meticulous care, allowing Mr. Gao to focus on his painting. Mr. Gao then adopted her as his daughter. This autumn, at the Sino-German Art Exhibition, Mr. Gao was chosen to represent China and go to Germany. Mr. Gao happily arrived in Shanghai to discuss matters. On the 16th and 17th of the month, he fell ill. Doctors said that he had a cold and overexertion, triggered a lung disease. After weeks of diagnosis and treatment, it was ineffective, and he passed away. During his illness, his mind was still clear. He first telegraphed Zhao Ming and others, requesting that the Tianfeng Building where he lived be used as the Qifeng Painting Academy, forever for the use of those who completed the art specialty. His lifetime works were distributed to art galleries at home and abroad. He also ordered that the debts owed by friends and relatives be canceled, not seeking repayment. Alas, this is enough to see his integrity. Mr. Gao passed away at the young age of forty-five. If he had been given more years, his contribution to the future of our country's art would have been even greater. Now it has ended here, which is not just a loss for the Gao family. Mr. Gao was erudite and versatile. In addition to painting, he was also skilled in poetry. His published works include 'The Truth Pictorial,' 'Qifeng Painting Collection,' 'New Painting Studies,' 'Qifeng Painting Models,' 'Art History,' 'Aesthetics and Education,' 'Origins of Aesthetics,' and other books. His works have been exhibited at the Ministry of Education, the National Art Exhibition, the Sino-Japanese Painting Exhibition, the West Lake Exposition, the Italian Panama World Exposition, the Belgian Centennial Exposition, and the Paris Art Exhibition, all of which received the highest awards. His colleagues will compile and publish his lifetime masterpieces. Central Political Committee Chairman Jin Jing Shushu, due to Mr. Gao's public funeral in Beijing, personally wrote the tomb inscription and sent it to Shanghai, praising him to the utmost. The text is long and will not be recorded here."</p>

<p>Lawyer Hou Zongtai, also a shareholder and director of Jingfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the factory applied to the First Special District Court for a public announcement of bankruptcy. Hou Zongtai, in order to clear his liability, published a statement in the newspaper. However, Zhu Xianghe, a director and assistant manager of the factory, published an article criticizing Hou Zongtai for using his lawyer qualifications to stir up trouble and seize legal fees from it. The words in the newspaper article seemed unclear, causing Hou great embarrassment. He believed that such criticism and insult were extremely detrimental to his career. He requested the criminal court of the District Court to punish Zhu Xianghe for defamation and order him to publish a retraction for ten days to restore his reputation. After questioning, the defendant did not appear. The court instructed the defendant's lawyer to notify the defendant to settle out of court. Yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi continued the hearing. The defendant still did not appear and was represented by lawyer Chen Bingsheng. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Fang Junjie, who stated that the defendant had failed to appear twice, which indicated that he was avoiding punishment. The defendant's lawyer claimed that the defendant resided at the Shanghai First Taiwan Hotel on Henan Road and that the jurisdiction was incorrect. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant lived at the Xu family's residence at No. 9 Huining Lane, Fuyou Road, and that the jurisdiction was not incorrect. At this point, the court asked the defendant's lawyer how the settlement was progressing. The lawyer replied that the plaintiff wanted a public apology in the newspaper, but the defendant claimed it was a fact, so the difference was too great. The court stated that the issue of jurisdiction, whether tried by this court or the Special District Court, would need to be legally resolved and that further investigation was required.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Local Security Officer Cai Fufu Accused of Disrupting Family; Verdict Set for 29th <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Cai Fufu, also known as Xuzhou, a local from Shanghai West who once served as a local security officer, used to run real estate and also opened the Mingyuelou Teahouse in Caojiadu. He was fond of women. Because the teahouse had Shanghai opera performances, Cai took advantage of this opportunity to seek out beauties. Wang Jingdi, the daughter of Wang Ye-gen who resided at No. 20 Caishinong, Roberts Road, also frequently went to the teahouse to listen to opera. Cai, seeing that Jingdi was slightly attractive, developed lustful intentions and repeatedly enticed her. On April 11th of this year, he used the excuse of taking her daughter out to play and lured her to the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, where he raped her. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by Jingdi's parents, who went to catch them in the act and apprehended them on the spot. Cai, knowing he was in the wrong, urgently sought someone to mediate and paid money to cover up the scandal. Unexpectedly, on May 11th of this year, Jingdi suddenly disappeared again. Although Jingdi's parents searched everywhere at the time, they could not find her. It was not until November 16th of this year that Jingdi's uncle, Chen Xinglin, came to the Wang's residence to report that Jingdi had been sent by Cai to stay at Chen's place and had died suddenly. After receiving the news, Wang Yegen and his wife were grief-stricken and went to the court to request an examination. They immediately filed a lawsuit with the District Court, accusing Cai Fufu and Chen Xinglin of disrupting the family. The case has been heard several times by the court, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that yesterday was another hearing date. Judge Wang Shanxiang again summoned and cross-examined the witnesses Cai Futang and his wife in detail. Then, Wang Yegen was summoned to testify. Wang stated that when he caught them in the act at the Hongxiang Hotel, he originally wanted to report it to the police. However, Cai and Jingdi repeatedly begged him to save face, and he was moved by his feelings for his daughter at the time, so he stopped. As for Cai Fufu's statement that he offered a bride price of a thousand gold to marry Jingdi as a concubine, it was pure fantasy. He requested the court to investigate. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Wang ruled that the facts of the case were clear and announced that the hearing of the case was concluded, setting the date for the verdict on the 29th of this month. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Zhabei Public Bus Employees Go on Strike Yesterday Morning; Party and Government Agencies Persuade Them to Resume Work at 11:00 AM <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the entire staff of the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company demanded that year-end double pay be issued according to the annual precedent. After the union negotiated with the company to no avail, they went on strike yesterday morning. Fortunately, after party and government agencies sent personnel to persuade them, they fully resumed work at 11:40 AM. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strike Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Regarding the year-end double pay, after the Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union negotiated with the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company to no avail, starting yesterday morning, Zhabei public buses on Route 1 (North Station to Jiangwan), Route 3 (North Station to Zhenru), Route 4 (North Station to the Municipal Government), Route 5 (North Station to the Municipal Government Dormitory), and Route 6 (Liping Road to the Water and Electricity Company) operated as usual, but all ticket sellers refused to sell tickets.</p>
<p>Party and Government Persuasion</p>
<p>The Social Bureau, after receiving the report at 9:00 AM yesterday, immediately sent Ren Zhusun, a mediator from the Third Section, to investigate the truth and persuade the workers to resume work first and wait for legal mediation. At the same time, Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the General Labor Union, after receiving a request from the workers, personally went to the company to find a way to mediate and persuade the workers to resume work. The workers accepted the persuasion from the government and others, and from 11:40 AM, all of them resumed work, and public buses on all routes resumed selling tickets.</p>
<p>Mediation Today</p>
<p>In order to quickly resolve the matter, the Social Bureau has scheduled a mediation meeting at 2:00 PM today, convening the Sixth District Public Bus Industry Professional Guild and the Zhabei Public Bus Company at the Bureau's First Mediation Room in the city center. The notice has been sent out last night.</p>
<p>Company Submission</p>
<p>The Chinese Public Bus Company submitted a document to the Social Bureau, stating: "Submission for the matter of a petition. Our company humbly shoulders the responsibility of public transportation in the urban area, enduring hardship and persevering for several years. However, business has been repeatedly affected by the current situation, and financial resources are extremely strained. In addition, in order to follow the needs of the new urban area's transportation, the routes have been expanded, and the number of kilometers driven has increased accordingly. Therefore, based on the past eleven months of operation this year, not only can dividends not be distributed according to regulations, but also the income and expenditure comparison shows a loss of more than ten thousand yuan. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month, we received a letter from the Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union stating that the year-end bonus for all employees this year should be issued based on 25 days. If we follow the request, it will cost more than six thousand yuan in national currency to cover the payment. However, our company suffered a severe loss of half of its capital during the January 28th Incident, and this amount has not been compensated to this day. Since resuming operations after the war, statistics over the years have still shown losses, which means that the losses this year are even greater. If we add the additional burden of the year-end bonus, the company will not be able to cope. We have answered the union and asked for their understanding. Later, on the 17th and 21st of this month, union directors Mao Xinhui, Liu Shouchun, Liang Guoming, Quan Renzhong, and Zhou Yimin came to discuss the matter twice. However, although the directors knew the company's difficulties and claimed that they had repeatedly explained to the workers, some of them still did not agree. In order to find a solution, it was decided at the time that each party would submit to your bureau for mediation, so as to seek a fair judgment and quell the dispute. Now, we respectfully submit a document with a statement of the company's operation for the past eleven months of this year for your examination. In order to avoid disputes, we also ask your bureau to convene the Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union for mediation as soon as possible, so as to maintain business and benefit transportation, which is truly a public convenience. Furthermore, Article 45, Paragraph 3 of the company's articles of association states that if there is a surplus in the year, 10% of the employees' bonus will be allocated, which shows that the company has long taken into account the welfare of employees. Combined statements. Respectfully submitted to the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, Pan.</p>
<p>Company Overview</p>
<p>According to sources from the company, it opened in November of the 17th year of the Republic, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. Ninety-five percent of the shareholders are overseas Chinese from the Americas. After the January 28th Incident, there was a deficit of 50,000 yuan. It was not until the 23rd year that the full amount was replenished. In order to meet the needs of urban prosperity, it was decided to increase the capital by another 100,000 yuan. When operations resumed after the war, most of the vehicles were damaged and incomplete. Three vehicles were dismantled, pieced together, and refurbished first and put into service. Subsequently, repairs and additions were gradually made, and today there are 45 vehicles. At that time, the number of employees started at 99, and now it has increased to 244. The annual salary started at more than 23,000 yuan, and now it has increased to more than 112,000 yuan. Since the old shareholders invested, in addition to the 100 yuan stock being changed to 50 yuan, dividends were only paid once in the 19th year, and so far they have not been able to be paid according to the regulations. Also, based on the past eleven months of operation this year, the income and expenditure comparison, excluding dividends, shows a loss of 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>During the Shaanxi Incident, the Eurasia Company:</p>
<h3 id="e163">Revised Flight Routes <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the outbreak of the Xi'an Incident first affected transportation between Shanghai and Shaanxi, causing the Shaanxi-Lanzhou section of the Eurasia Aviation Company's Shanghai-Shaanxi line and the Lanzhou-Baotou line to be blocked and unable to fly. The company has now changed its flight schedule during this period so that, except for the Lanzhou and Shaanxi stations, all other stations can still connect with Beijing, Shanghai, Pingzhen, and other stations to facilitate transportation. However, recent reports have varied greatly regarding the revised flight schedule, causing many people to misunderstand the truth. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed Mr. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, about this matter. It was learned that the company's current flights, except for the one from Shanghai via Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang to Chengdu Jianming, which still flies as usual every Tuesday and Friday and returns every Thursday and Sunday, the northbound flights also connect in Zhengzhou every Tuesday and Friday, flying directly to Beiping via Taiyuan. On Wednesdays, they fly from Beiping via Baotou directly to Ningxia and return from Ningxia via Baotou to Beiping on the same day. On Thursdays and Sundays, they fly south from Beiping via Taiyuan to Zhengzhou, connecting with the eastbound flights from Chengdu Jianming to return to Shanghai. Therefore, except for Xi'an and Lanzhou, which are temporarily difficult to fly to, all other places can still be reached without obstruction, and it is possible to reach Taiyuan and Beiping from Shanghai on the same day. It is also possible to reach Baotou, Ningxia, and other places before noon on the designated days, which is more convenient than before.</p>

<p>The three renowned photographers Ao Enhong, Guang Fu, and Lu Yu publicly exhibited their works at the fourth floor of the Great China Department Store from the 19th to the 31st of this month. The audience has been very enthusiastic in recent days. There are more than 200 works in total. It takes half a year for Guang Fu to develop the photos. At this critical moment of aiding Suiyuan, the three photographers are widely promoting their art, which will make our spirit of aiding Suiyuan even more enthusiastic. It is heard that their method of aiding Suiyuan is to donate half of the proceeds from the sale of their works to aid Suiyuan. We hope that all sectors of society will not hesitate and generously donate to fulfill their patriotic responsibility and to comfort the hard work of the three photographers. It is truly a win-win situation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, we have reviewed the telegram of Geng. The foreign rice tax was originally established to protect domestic agricultural products. This year, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces have reported good harvests, with surplus grain to supply the needs of Guangdong Province. It is not appropriate to exempt the foreign rice tax immediately, which would hinder the sale of domestic rice. We have already telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government to investigate. However, Guangdong Province has always been a rice-deficient area, and this year's summer floods and autumn droughts have made the shortage of food even greater than in previous years. You should immediately inform all merchants to transport rice produced in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui to Guangdong in a steady stream to provide relief, so as to prevent the people of Guangdong Province from being panicked about food, and to assist the government's intention to protect domestic products. This is our earnest hope. Ministry of Finance (seal)."</p>

At noon, Great Monk Zhiguo led the offering of the Heavenly Table, and Yu Yanju, Yu Jingbo, and Shao Ruxin, each layperson held a plate of incense and knelt in the open air, praying for an hour. After the Heavenly Table was burned, it immediately rained and snowed. Dozens of foreigners living in Shanghai visited the altar and respectfully bowed and took off their hats in front of the Longevity Tablet of Generalissimo Chiang in the main hall to express their respect. In the evening, Great Monk Changan led more than five hundred monks from all over Shanghai to chant scriptures all night long. This morning, the former chairman of the National Buddhist Association, Old Monk Qinghai, presided over the offering of incense. At noon, Shen Songsheng, the chairman of the Taoist Association of Shanqian, personally led the Taoist priests to gather in the ritual and Taoist circles to hold a three-day, three-night prayer meeting on a large scale for Generalissimo Chiang's misfortune in Xi'an.

<p>Regarding the recent outbreak of smallpox in this city, the Public Concession Health Department has previously released news. Last month, a total of nineteen cases of smallpox were reported, and four people died without being saved. According to a recent statement by a spokesperson of the department, the disease has suddenly increased sharply in the past week. The Concession authorities believe that it has become a mild epidemic. Although residents in the Concession do not need to panic seriously because of this, the advice issued by the health authorities previously can no longer be ignored. Even adults need to be vaccinated at least once every few years. Regardless of whether blisters appear or not, prevention is necessary. In order to ensure the safety of residents in the Concession, the Health Department has recently intensified its promotion, using methods such as issuing booklets, leaflets, banners, movie theaters, wireless broadcasting, etc., which have achieved significant results. Staff for vaccination can be found at various health sub-bureaus and vaccination car locations. It is hoped that residents in the Concession will quickly request free vaccination nearby to avoid trouble for themselves.</p>

<p>The French Concession Police apprehended a habitual thief and robber involved in multiple robbery cases. They were taken to the victims' homes to reenact the robberies. Due to the incomplete investigation, the trial was postponed.</p>
<p>Inspector Jiang Futian of the French Concession Police received a tip-off from an informant at 4 PM on the 22nd that Yang Changgen, a Ningbo native with the alias "High-Nosed Changgen" (age 26), a habitual thief wanted by the Public Concession Police with a warrant issued by the First Special District Court, was hiding in Room 14 of the Changjiang Hotel at No. 2 Aiduoli, Lane 14, Zhengjia Muqiao Street.

<p>Wu Ruisheng, the son of a wealthy family, resides at No. 680 Haig Road. His wife, Shi Meiying, suspected him of having an affair, which angered Wu, who physically assaulted her. A report was filed with the police, and a public prosecution was initiated in the First Special District Court. Subsequently, Shi's lawyer, Shen Xingxia, raised a jurisdictional issue, arguing that Wu's residence was on an extra-settlement road and should be under the jurisdiction of the District Court. The court ordered further investigation before a decision. Yesterday morning, the case continued to be heard. The court declared that it had dispatched police to investigate, and the report stated that No. 680 Haig Road was within the area of an extra-settlement road. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu and the defendant's lawyer, Wu Linkun,</p>

<p>Chen Liangzhen, devoid of conscience, pawned his wife's overcoat. When his wife tried to stop him, he banged her head against the wall. After a lawsuit in court, the judge persuaded them to settle the matter.</p>
<p>Chen Liangzhen, a Chaozhou native, age 24, whose father was a wealthy merchant, possessed some assets. Eight years ago, he married Yao Sujuan (age 27), a woman from the same hometown, and they had children. The couple had a good relationship, but Chen did not work and was extravagant. His mother limited his finances, giving him only 40 yuan a month for spending money. Recently, Chen suddenly cohabited with a dancer named Chen Lingzhu, causing a sudden rift between the couple. On the 15th of the month, Chen, being short of money, took his wife Yao Sujuan's overcoat and pawned it at 1 PM. When she gently tried to stop him,</p>
<p>Chen became angry, grabbed Yao, and banged</p>
<p>her head against the wall, causing her head to be injured. A report was filed with the</p>
<p>Ansi Temple Police Station, who instructed Detective Wang Wenbin to investigate Chen's residence at No. 121, Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road. After being verified by the maid, Wang Xiangshi, a lawsuit was filed in the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Pan Zhenyang of the Second Criminal Division conducted a hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Code. Yao Anjuan then explained Chen's affair with the dancer, the pawning of the overcoat, and the assault. Chen Liangzhen denied the allegations, claiming that Yao was intentionally trying to ruin him. After Judge Tian's persuasion, Yao stated that if her husband could redeem the overcoat, she would withdraw the lawsuit. Chen, also persuaded by the judge, agreed to redeem the overcoat.</p>
<p>The court then ruled that it would not hear the case.</p>

<p>Hu Yuanyuan and others are accused of illegally occupying and destroying ancestral graves. The court ruled that the criminal trial be suspended and that a civil lawsuit be filed first to confirm property rights.</p>
<p>Wang Fuquan, a local, retained lawyer Tang Xingjian to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Hu Xingyuan of No. 305, Baier Road, and local leader Xu Wenquan (mentioned in the document) of colluding to illegally occupy a cemetery, destroy ancestral graves, and abandon remains, requesting investigation and return of the coffins. It was stated that their ancestor purchased four plots of land from Zhu Yueqing at the intersection of Shijian Road and Lafayette Road, located at No. 711, Tujingziwei, Section 1, Bao 27, during the third month of Guangxu 23, where eight ancestral coffins were buried. Now, local leader Xu Wenquan, Hu Xingyuan, and others had illegally occupied the land, destroyed the graves, and discarded all coffins and remains in the public cemetery. The court, based on the complaint, opened a hearing yesterday with Judge Sun Penghanzhuan. The defendant, Xu Wenquan, refused to receive the summons and did not appear because of a mistake in his name. Hu Xingyuan arrived with his defense lawyer, Wang Jian'e. The plaintiff testified about the previous situation and presented the purchase contract and field registration photos as evidence. The defendant, Hu Xingyuan, stated that the land was purchased by his late father, totaling three plots, and passed on to his sister, Hu Zhiyi. At that time, only a blank contract was given to her. Now, the blank contract was entrusted to Zhu Guiqing to apply to the Land Bureau for a land license, but Zhu lost the original contract and forged a false contract, which has been sued in the District Court. As for the excavated coffins, they were twelve coffins of his own ancestors, but there were two temporary coffins on the ground that no one claimed. A notice was posted asking people to claim them, but no one came to claim them after more than a month, so he entrusted the charity hall to collect them for burial and did not abandon them. The court, after reviewing the statements, ruled that both parties were contesting property rights, so it suspended the criminal trial and directed the plaintiff to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division to confirm property rights before proceeding with the criminal case, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Shameless in old age, plotting to rape a goddaughter: private settlement, public prosecution proceeds</p>
<p>Shi Zhang, a woman from Qingjiang living at No. 3, Nanfang Lane, Gaochang Temple, is 38 years old and has a daughter named Baoshi, who is 16 years old this year. She is exceptionally beautiful. Baoshi usually lives with the neighbor Peng Song (age 30, from Hubei, living at No. 50, Jiuda Street, Gaochang Temple), who is regarded as her foster mother. They often visit each other and are very close. However, Peng Song is not a proper person. Liang Dingguo, a 41-year-old man from Hubei, is a manager on a Wutai ship. Although he is old, he has a lot of money, so Peng Song regards Liang as her cash cow. However, Liang is lustful and often sees Baobao at Peng Song's house. He is struck by her beauty and has improper thoughts. He conspired with Peng Song. Because of the age gap, it was difficult to get close to her. Peng Song, a procuress-like figure, devised a plan to introduce the girl to Liang as his goddaughter. Shi Zhang was delighted to have this wealthy man as a relative and did not expect that he would use the father-daughter relationship to pursue a secret affair. On May 16th of this year, Liang first tried his luck with Baobao at Peng Song's place. Afterwards, he often used Peng Song's house as a rendezvous point. Recently, Shi Zhang learned about it. Seeing her daughter's strange behavior, she inquired about the situation and was furious. She reported the case to the police, who arrested Peng Song and Liang Dingguo and brought them to the District Court. Prosecutor Deng Peiyi investigated the case and prosecuted Peng Song for abduction. Liang Dingguo was prosecuted for rape, as he had committed sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen. Yesterday, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the hearing. Because the two parties had reached a settlement outside of court, the plaintiff appeared in court and requested to withdraw the charges. The judge ruled that the charges against Liang Dingguo were subject to prosecution, so the request was not granted, and the defense lawyer was ordered to post bail.

<h3 id="e194">Mozi Rejects Chu to Save Song <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Shu</p>
<p>——Saving a Country Requires Strength, Not Empty Words——</p>
<p>"Alas, it's really not good to be a weak country!" One night, Mozi sat alone in his small room, sighing at the candle flickering by the window, about to be blown out by the howling wind. As he spoke, he rose and piled many books high, covering a large hole in the window leaf, preventing the wind from blowing in.</p>
<p>He was a man of the Song state in the Warring States period. Unfortunately, at that time, hegemony was rampant. The strong attacked the weak, and the majority sought to annex the minority, often leading to massacres throughout cities and fields. He was a man of benevolence and could not bear to see such tragic massacres, so he advocated "non-aggression." He knew that war led to a lack of love, so he advocated "universal love." He saw that mutual love was mutually beneficial, but unfortunately, the world was blinded by selfish desires and did not understand this principle, so he traveled tirelessly to various countries to promote his doctrine of universal love. He was now going to the state of Qi to promote his doctrine of universal love. From Song to Qi, it was necessary to pass through the state of Lu. He did not want to disturb the people of Lu by greeting him, so he quietly hid in a small inn. He was planning to set off for Qi tomorrow when he suddenly heard the news that the state of Chu was about to attack the state of Song. In that case, he had no choice but to turn back and save his country first.</p>
<p>He sat anxiously, waiting for daybreak to open the city gates and start his journey. He pondered, and could not help but hate Gongshu Ban, the culprit who helped with the war. He still remembered clearly the words he had spoken with Ban in the state of Chu last month. It was a boring afternoon on a rainy day. Mozi visited Ban, and Ban kept him for dinner. After dinner, they began to talk like this:</p>
<p>"I am so proud. The military equipment I have made for fighting on ships is so good. The state of Yue really saw me defeat them!" Ban said gleefully, wiping his mouth and smiling at Mozi.</p>
<p>"With your skills, wouldn't it be great if you wholeheartedly helped your ancestral country (Ban was from the state of Lu) to escape the oppression of the state of Qi?" Mozi said, both as a loyal admonition and as a mockery.</p>
<p>"Um—" Ban blushed, unable to speak. After a while, he said, "Lu is too small, and there is no place for heroes to use their talents. How can you blame me for leaving it?"</p>
<p>"According to what you say, it is difficult for people to . If a country cannot get the love of its people because it is small, if this trend continues, in the future, everyone will only know selfishness, and I am afraid that weak children and elderly parents will not be cared for. What kind of world would that be?" Mozi was a little angry.</p>
<p>Ban sneered, "Sir, you are talking about benevolence and righteousness again! Let me ask you, my naval battle has hooks to grab and resist. Does your benevolence and righteousness also have hooks to grab and resist?"</p>
<p>"Why not? My hooks to grab and resist of benevolence and righteousness are much better than your hooks to grab and resist of naval battle. I use love to grab and respect to resist. If you don't use love to grab, you won't get people to be close to you; if you don't use respect to resist, you will provoke people to be familiar and disrespectful with you. If you are familiar but not close, it will lead to separation. So mutual benefit is the same. Today, if you use hooks to grab people, people will also use hooks to grab you; if you use resistance to resist people, people will also use resistance to resist you. So mutual grabbing and mutual resistance are the same as mutual harm. Therefore, my hooks to grab and resist of benevolence and righteousness are better than your hooks to grab and resist of naval battle." Mozi's words were very reasonable, and Ban could not refute him. After a long time , he never thought that this time he would actually make siege ladders for the King of Chu, preparing to attack Song.</p>
<p>This time, Mozi still decided to reason with Ban. He set off from the state of Lu, eager to save Song, and did not rest all the way, running for ten days and ten nights. His feet were broken, but he didn't care. Seeing that there was too much bleeding, he tore off a piece of clothing from his body to . With great difficulty, he ran to Yingdu to find Ban. Seeing Mozi coming fiercely, Ban knew that he had something to say, and quickly asked, "Sir, are you here? What do you want to tell me?"</p>
<p>Mozi gasped a few times before saying, out of breath, "There are several people in the north who have insulted me, and I want to ask you to kill them." Ban helped Mozi sit down, looking displeased. Mozi said, "If this is successful, I will reward you with ten pieces of gold."</p>
<p>"I am righteous in not killing people."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Mozi was very moved. He quickly got up and bowed twice, expressing his sympathy for Ban, and then said very seriously, "Please listen to me for a few words: I heard in the north that you have already made siege ladders and are about to attack the state of Song. What crime has Song committed? The state of Jing, that is, the state of Chu, has excess land but insufficient people. Killing what is insufficient to fight for what is excess cannot be called wisdom; attacking the innocent Song cannot be called benevolence; knowing it is wrong but not arguing strongly cannot be called loyalty; arguing strongly but failing cannot be called strong righteousness; not killing the few but killing the many cannot be called knowing the class."</p>
<p>Hearing Mozi's words, Ban expressed his conviction. Mozi said, "Then, you ."</p>
<p>"That won't work, because I have already told the king about the plan to attack Song."</p>
<p>"Then, why not introduce me to the king?"</p>
<p>Ban immediately agreed. Mozi quickly took out an old dress from his clothing package and put it on, buttoning one or two buttons haphazardly, and then followed Ban to court to see the King of Chu. They didn't talk for a few words before Mozi directly asked the King of Chu, " someone who does not want his own painted carriage, but wants to steal his neighbor's broken cart; does not want his own brocade, but wants to steal his neighbor's short felt jacket; does not want his own rice and meat, but wants to steal his neighbor's bran. What kind of person does Your Majesty think this is?"</p>
<p>"This person must have a stealing disease," the King of Chu replied without thinking.</p>
<p>Mozi immediately seized the opportunity to say directly, "The land of Jing is five thousand li square, while the land of Song is only five hundred li square. This is like the comparison between a painted carriage and a broken cart. Jing has Yunmeng (in today's Jianli and Shishou counties in Hubei), full of rhinoceroses, rhinoceroses, deer, and deer, and the fish, turtles, and turtles of the Jianghan River are the richest in the world. As for Song, it is even inevitable that there are no crucian carp. This is like the comparison between rice and meat and bran. Jing has tall pines, catalpa, and other large trees, while Song has no large trees. This is like the comparison between brocade and short felt jackets. Today, Your Majesty's attack on Song, I think, also belongs to this kind of behavior."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! You are right. " The King of Chu nodded and said, "But Gongshu Ban is the most skillful person in the world. He made a siege ladder for me, and I will definitely be able to capture Song ."</p>
<p>At this time, Mozi also knew that those who were deceived by profit and desire could not be persuaded with righteousness, and he could not but propose his final effective method, strength, to control the King of Chu's ambition to invade. So he asked to compare each other's attack and defense strategies. They performed in front of the King of Chu. Mozi took off his belt and used it as a city, and broke chopsticks as military equipment. Ban used nine kinds of maneuvers to attack the city, and Mozi also used nine kinds of maneuvers to defend against the enemy. As a result, Ban's siege equipment, such as siege ladders, battering rams, flying stones, and crossbows, were all used up, but he still could not break through Mozi's defense line. It was obvious that Ban had lost. But he refused to admit defeat, and said maliciously, "I know how to win you, but I won't say it." Mozi saw through Ban's trick and smiled, "I know what you want to do to win me, but I won't say it."</p>
<p>The King of Chu was very surprised and asked Mozi what he knew. Mozi said, "Gongshu Zi's intention is just to kill me. He thinks that if he kills me, the state of Song will definitely have no one to defend it, and he can break through it; but he doesn't know that my disciples Lihua Li and others, three hundred in number, have already taken my defensive equipment and are waiting for the Chu army on the walls of Song. Even if you kill me, Song still cannot be captured."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes! That's a good idea! Then I won't attack the state of Song anymore." The King of Chu said very firmly.</p>
<p>Ban was still not at ease and secretly sent people to the state of Song to inquire. Sure enough, the state of Song was prepared. Attacking a prepared country is a great taboo in military law, so the King of Chu had no choice but to withdraw the order to attack.</p>

<p>— Li Su</p>
<p>A story from the Roman-Carthaginian Wars</p>
<p>(Regulus was a great general of Rome, captured by the Carthaginians and made a prisoner. The beginning of this story is: Several Carthaginian leaders went to the prison to visit Regulus. They wanted Regulus to ask Rome to sue for peace.)</p>
<p>One, a prison cell in a Carthaginian prison</p>
<p>(Regulus): Gentlemen, the prison guard told me you wanted to talk to me.</p>
<p>(A): Yes, Regulus, we hope to end this current war because both sides have suffered significant loss of life. We have come up with a plan to negotiate peace with Rome. We have come to you hoping you can help us implement it.</p>
<p>(Regulus): Sir, why talk to me about peace and war? How can I help you? Am I not a defeated general and your prisoner?</p>
<p>(A): We are confident that your Roman compatriots do not know the seriousness of the situation in Africa. If they know that you have been defeated and are a prisoner, we believe they will welcome an opportunity to negotiate peace with us.</p>
<p>(Regulus): Sir, I believe Rome will fight. I know my country will not cease fighting until Carthage is overthrown. Why would we negotiate peace with you?</p>
<p>(B): When your compatriots understand that you are our prisoner, and your troops, at least those remaining, are in our control, and Carthage is now safe from Roman attack, you need not affirm that they will agree with you.</p>
<p>(Regulus): What you have heard is true, but in my country, people greater than Regulus are prepared and happy to die for Rome. My hope is that the misfortune of the current situation will not last long. But Carthaginians, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p>(A): We are willing to give you freedom, to let you go to Rome. However, there are two conditions, unless you agree to fulfill these terms we cannot let you go.</p>
<p>(Regulus): Then let me know. I need to know your purpose before I can decide whether to agree or not.</p>
<p>(A): We want you to agree that as soon as you arrive in Rome, you will immediately report to the Roman people the losses of this disastrous battle in which you were captured. You must especially report how many soldiers were killed and how many were captured. When they hear this report from Regulus' mouth, they will no longer be able to doubt, so they will not fail to understand that Rome has failed in this war.</p>
<p>(Regulus): What is the second condition?</p>
<p>(B): If the Romans refuse to sue for peace after hearing your report, you must agree to return to Carthage.</p>
<p>(Regulus): I am very willing to agree to these two things. I will report the losses of this campaign and mention the exact number of those killed and captured. And, if after my report, the Roman leaders are unwilling to negotiate peace, I promise you with the reputation of a Roman general that I will definitely return to Carthage.</p>
<p>(B): Agreed. We will report the results of our conversation to the Carthaginian government tomorrow morning. You will be free to take the first ship sailing to Rome.</p>
<p>(Regulus): Thank you, gentlemen. Good night.</p>
<p>Carthaginians: Good night, Regulus.</p>
<p>Two, in Rome</p>
<p>(Regulus and several leaders of the Roman government and army are sitting in his house.)</p>
<p>(Regulus): Welcome to my home, friends.</p>
<p>Roman A: Regulus, it is very gratifying to have you back in Rome. Rome does not often have the opportunity to see her generals. The Carthaginian War has left many of our best soldiers in Africa. I hear you have brought us news from Carthage.</p>
<p>(Regulus): What you have heard is true, gentlemen. I have returned home to report that the war in Africa is currently not in our favor. Rome was defeated in the last battle I participated in. My entire army was either killed or became prisoners. I myself was captured and imprisoned in Carthage. And I promised the Carthaginians to tell the Roman people about the seriousness of the war situation. They also told me to convey that if the Romans sue for peace, the Carthaginians are willing to negotiate a peace treaty.</p>
<p>(B): Peace! You, Regulus, a soldier, come to us to talk about making peace with the enemy?</p>
<p>(Regulus): Indeed. The Carthaginians sent me for this purpose. I have now fulfilled my promise. But now that I have reported, I am willing to advise you as a Roman general. May I?</p>
<p>(A): Of course, Regulus. Say as much as you like. We want to hear everything you have to say.</p>
<p>(Regulus): I strongly advise my country not to consider any peace treaties. Rome has failed several times, and at present our forces in Africa cannot conquer Carthage. All this is very true. But the Carthaginians have suffered significant losses and are gradually growing tired of the war. I think they are proposing a peace treaty to us because they are afraid of the future.</p>
<p>(B): This is really good news, Regulus. Here in Rome, it is very difficult to know for sure what the situation is in Africa. And it's hard to know who to believe. So you advise us to continue this war?</p>
<p>(Regulus): No matter what, just keep going. If we continue this war a little longer, Carthage will fall into our hands.</p>
<p>(A): I wish to express my gratitude on behalf of myself and the Roman government for what you have said. You have made our responsibilities clear to us.</p>
<p>Three, back at the same place the next day</p>
<p>(As Regulus is talking to his family, several Romans walk in.)</p>
<p>(B): I have come to speak on behalf of the people and leaders of Rome. You should immediately lead one of the new armies we are preparing to send to Africa. This is their unanimous hope. Your long experience and full understanding of the war situation in Africa make you the only person to bear this responsibility.</p>
<p>(Regulus): I am sorry to tell you that what you propose is impossible.</p>
<p>(A): Impossible! Why?</p>
<p>(Regulus): Because I must return tomorrow.</p>
<p>His wife: Return to Carthage? Ah, Regulus, I can't let you leave us again. Look at your children here! I beg you to think of them before you decide.</p>
<p>(A): Return to Carthage! That is too foolish. If you go back and our government refuses to negotiate peace, what will happen to you?</p>
<p>(Regulus): I know very well that my country will not negotiate peace. In any case, I have already promised that if Rome refuses to sue for peace, I will immediately return to Carthage.</p>
<p>(Wife): That means you will definitely die, Regulus.</p>
<p>(Regulus): I have known the meaning of my actions since I left Carthage. But I hope to say goodbye to my children, let my wife know that I expect her to be a brave person like a Roman woman should be, and Rome should continue to fight. I firmly believe that in a few months, Carthage will become ours.</p>
<p>(B): Brave Regulus! The Roman people will never forget your name.</p>
<p>(Regulus): What I ask is that Rome treat my wife and children well, so that they will never lack money and friends. Now, goodbye my compatriots! It's getting late, and before I leave, I have many words to say to my wife and children.</p>
<p>Romans: Good night, Regulus. Everything you have said will be conveyed to the people of Rome.</p>
<p>Four, Regulus returns to Carthage</p>
<p>What remains to be said is that Regulus fulfilled his promise. He returned to Carthage, while Rome continued to fight. When Rome refused to negotiate peace, Regulus was brutally murdered by the Carthaginians. But in the end, Rome won the war. Better than that, history remembers Regulus for sacrificing his life for keeping faith with an enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The Ending of the Northern Song Dynasty and the Lessons of its Fall <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Da Chuan</p>
<p>— One of the Records of Laughable Matters in Reading History</p>
<p>Among the emperors of fallen dynasties, the tragic circumstances of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Northern Song Dynasty were perhaps the most extreme. Historians often attribute the humiliation suffered by these two emperors and the downfall of the Northern Song Dynasty to the signs of decline in the Northern Song, and its inability to resist the massive southward advance of the Jin army. While this is historically accurate, the demise of the Northern Song also stemmed from the self-inflicted humiliation of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong, and their seeking their own destruction.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Huizong, after the Jin people destroyed the Liao dynasty, their national power was strong. Although Emperor Huizong, as agreed, acquired the cultural artifacts and institutions of Yanjing (present-day Beijing), they had already been looted by the Jin people and were empty. At the same time, the Song had to annually pay the Jin dynasty one million strings of cash, and 200,000 bolts each of silver and silk as tax revenue collected from Yanjing. Later, Emperor Huizong repeatedly broke the agreement and initiated hostilities, which led to the Jin army marching south to demand justice, prompting Emperor Huizong's abdication and Emperor Qinzong's succession. Later, 60,000 Jin soldiers besieged Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng), while the Song had more than 200,000 troops ready to come to the capital's defense. However, they refused to adopt Li Gang's proposal for a decisive battle, and instead dismissed him to appease the Jin. Although he was temporarily reinstated at the request of the university students, the result was a humiliating peace, ceding three towns, paying huge amounts of money, and sending princes and ministers as hostages, while respectfully addressing the Jin ruler as "Uncle." This opened a rare chapter of shame in history.</p>
<p>After such a severe and devastating blow, Emperor Qinzong repeatedly broke the alliance. Therefore, the Jin army launched another major southward invasion. Jin general Nianhan led his troops across the river and besieged Bianjing. Soon, he again garrisoned troops, demanding money and land for peace, and sent spies to weaken the Song army. At that time, the ministers of the court lacked wisdom and were divided between advocating for peace and war, unable to reach a consensus! In the end, both the rulers and the subjects sought only temporary security and did not regard the Jin as a threat. Later, the Jin army marched south again, and Bianjing was captured for the second time. At that time, only three or four out of ten soldiers in the capital were capable of fighting, and they foolishly listened to the sorcerer Guo Jing's incantations, opened the gates to welcome the enemy, and hastened their own defeat. "Records of Night Talks Avoiding the Enemy" described the event: "Initially, when the capital was besieged, the court was eager to appoint generals. There was Guo Jing, originally a soldier in the Dragon Guard Camp of the Palace Guards, who was widely rumored to be able to use the Six Jia magic, to capture Nianhan alive and sweep away the remaining enemies without a trace. The court deeply believed in this." It also said, "The people he recruited were all idle men from the marketplace, of all kinds, not caring whether they were skilled in riding or archery, only choosing those whose years and fates matched the Six Jia... Guo Jing spoke and laughed freely, like a man of Dao, and chose a date to send out troops, promising peace." This kind of sorcery was very similar to the Boxer Rebellion during the Gengzi Incident, and its harm to the country and the people was indescribable. "Records of Night Talks Avoiding the Enemy" also said: "On the 25th day, the Xuanhua Gate was opened wide, and Guo Jing led his troops out... The Jin soldiers advanced in two wings, cheering loudly, crushing the front vehicles, sweeping them away as if cutting grass. Those behind were jealous and dragged them away... The soldiers defending the city and the common people in front caused the city to fall. Anger filled their hearts."</p>
<p>After the fall of Bianjing, Nianhan sent envoys to seek a peace treaty with the two emperors as prisoners, and to discuss the issue of land. All the cultural relics and books of the court were looted. At that time, it was snowing heavily in the capital, and the price of rice soared. Starved corpses filled the roads, and the Jin soldiers continued their large-scale looting. The number of people who died or were injured was countless. The tragedy of the fallen country was such.</p>
<p>The two emperors traveled north, suffering all kinds of human misery, even to the point of dying on the road or being killed. Later generations who read history cannot help but sigh and shed tears for them. Volume one of "Records of the Southern Remnants" stated: "When the two emperors' carriages arrived at the Jin camp, tens of thousands of common people blocked the carriages, wailing and refusing to let them pass. The emperors also wept." It also stated: "The two emperors and two empresses were all squatting in the mud, their food was coarse, their appearance was dark and haggard, their eyes were dim. The Supreme Emperor mistakenly fell into it, and they barely managed to pull him out. Empress Zheng also fell and injured her foot." It also stated: "The two emperors were imprisoned by the Jin people. In the middle of the day, they only received four bean cakes, which were divided among four people." The circumstances of the once noble emperors after the fall of their country cannot be expressed with mere tears of sorrow.</p>
<p>Volume two of "Records of the Southern Remnants" stated: "The soldiers tied the two emperors and two empresses in the courtyard and urinated and defecated on them." It also stated: "The two empresses were barefoot and unable to walk. Even when riding horses, their feet were covered in sores, and their flesh was thin and wasted. The two emperors were also withered and did not resemble living beings. They were scolded and whipped by the guards, with no way to die." It also stated: "The Jin ruler entered the palace, and attendants held the knees of the two emperors and empresses, kneeling on the ground. They all bowed twice." It also stated: "The attendants punched their mouths, causing them to bleed and their teeth to break, and then dragged them away. They were then brought into the front room and bound with ropes. The emperor wept without making a sound."</p>
<p>The humiliation of the fallen emperors had reached its extreme, but the misfortune of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong did not end there. The record of their circumstances of dying on the road or being killed is unbearable to witness: "Looking into the earthen pit, they saw that the Supreme Emperor was stiff and dead. The young emperor wailed loudly. The attendants led the local people to pierce the Supreme Emperor's corpse with wood, burn it halfway and extinguish it with water, and then discard the corpse into the pit." The tragic death of Emperor Huizong made Emperor Qinzong even more grief-stricken. "Stealing Feelings and Continuing Records" stated, "Some said that the young emperor wept and said, 'My father fell into a pit and drowned, my mother was buried by the roadside, my wife was wrapped in a bamboo mat, no different from the death of dogs and pigs! I don't know what will happen to me? If I die, it may not be different from this.'" Indeed, Emperor Qinzong's grief was no different from his anticipation of his tragic death, and his death was even more tragic. "Stealing Feelings and Continuing Records" also stated: "In the sixth year of Zhenglong, the Jin ruler Liang hosted a banquet for the princes and ministers in the military training hall and ordered the emperor and the Marquis of Binhai to play Cuju (ancient Chinese football). After the game, hundreds of Hu cavalrymen came from the corner of the field and charged directly in front of the emperor. A man in Jie clothing shot Yanxi through the heart and killed him under the horse. The emperor saw this, turned pale, and fell off his horse. Another man in purple clothing shot the emperor with an arrow. The emperor died, his body was not collected, but trampled into the ground by horses. The emperor was sixty years old when he died, the misfortune of the horse's feet."</p>
<p>After the fall of the Northern Song Dynasty, the two emperors and two empresses died in this way, leaving behind a tearful and bloody mark of humiliation and forbearance in history, forever serving as a lesson for those who lose their countries in later generations.</p>
<h3 id="e197">How to Study Philosophy (V) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>Written by Wang Te-fu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore</p>
<p>7. Steps for conducting research: The steps for studying philosophy should begin with the study of generalized, abstract problems, that is, from the study of epistemology and methods of cognition. This is the study of the core of philosophy. Because philosophy originally absorbed the achievements of specialized sciences to build its foundation and enrich its content, its research must move from generalized, abstract research to specialized, concrete research. However, philosophical research only takes the study of specific objects as one stage of the research process. It must return from the study of concrete individual problems to the study of general, abstract problems; abstract general laws from the study of realistic objects of various parts, and create general conclusions that can be common to the entire universe, thus constructing a general worldview. In addition, the research on various theoretical models in philosophy should also adopt such a process and route. In short, whether studying philosophical problems themselves or studying various theoretical models of philosophy, one must adopt the method of moving from generalized and abstract research to specialized and concrete research, and then to generalized and abstract research. This return is not a simple regression, but a research method that moves towards a higher stage of development, which is the dialectical research method.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Yuan Changying's "Peacock Flies Southeast" and Others <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>"Peacock Flies Southeast"</p>
<p>(1) Creative Motivation and Writing Attitude</p>
<p>Using the marriage tragedy of Lan Zhi and Zhong Qing in the ancient poem "Peacock Flies Southeast" as a drama theme, as early as fourteen years ago, the drama "Peacock Flies Southeast" in five acts, collectively created by the fourth-grade students of the Chinese Department of Beijing Women's Higher Normal School, was published by the New China Drama Association. Yuan Changying's "Peacock Flies Southeast" and other one-act plays, published by the Commercial Press, were written ten years later and published in 1979. At the same time, there was also Xiong Foxi's one-act play "Lan Zhi and Zhong Qing." With the same theme, the creative focus of the playwrights may not be exactly the same, which is a fact. Regarding this point, as well as the techniques and methods of each play, I will discuss it in another article.</p>
<p>As for Yuan's own central viewpoint in creating this play, she herself has clearly stated in the preface:</p>
<p>"... I have learned that there is always a psychological background to the relationship between people. Jiao's mother's dislike of Lan Zhi is naturally a psychological effect. Based on my personal experience and daily observations, I speculate that most of the discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law is due to "jealousy." I am not saying that there is any secret behavior between the mother and son that makes her jealous of the daughter-in-law... If she encounters someone who is still young, passionate, and unfortunately a widow, the tragedy of Zhong Qing and Lan Zhi will inevitably occur."</p>
<p>Most authors who write family tragedies tend to focus on fate. Family tragedies are the result of people fighting against fate. Yuan's writing of "Peacock Flies Southeast" can eliminate this prejudice and create a unique view of psychological effects, which is indeed a profound understanding. Based on this point of view, the author has made great efforts to study the social customs of the time in order to achieve complete success, which is especially commendable. Because new attempts can hold a serious and non-casual attitude, which is rare. This should be especially mentioned when writing this article.</p>
<p>(2) Synopsis of Each Act</p>
<p>The whole play is divided into three acts</p>
<p>Act One: Zhong Qing before marriage is ill because he misses Lan Zhi. His mother tries to comfort him with love. The neighbor comes to talk and persuades the mother to quickly complete the marriage for her son to dispel bad luck. The mother reveals her thoughts, fearing that after her son marries a wife, she will be placed behind her. The matchmaker comes and urges the marriage. Zhong Qing hears the good news and recovers quickly. This shows the factors of the widowed mother's love for her son and jealousy of the future daughter-in-law's position.</p>
<p>Act Two: After Lan Zhi's marriage, the couple's love is pleasant, but they cannot get the mother's forgiveness. She suffers daily abuse and excessive labor, but she endures without complaint. The mother does not allow her to stay in the room, angry that her son loves his wife more than his mother, and finally sends Lan Zhi back to her mother's house.</p>
<p>Act Three: A scene on the outskirts of the road. The news of Lan Zhi's remarriage comes, and they are forced to die together with Zhong Qing, and the mother goes insane. This completes a great human tragedy.</p>
<p>(3) Characters</p>
<p>The existing characters have not been greatly increased or decreased here. Count:</p>
<p>"Jiao's mother, Grandmother</p>
<p>Lan Zhi, Matchmaker</p>
<p>Zhong Qing, Hua'er</p>
<p>Young uncle, Maid"</p>
<p>The roles have reached the most economical point. Of course, economy can be a harmful existence in some dramas.</p>

<p>The sea is tired, like a fierce lion, retracting its wild roar, calming its anger, and sleeping in the gentle breeze.</p>
<p>Who knows how long it will sleep? At this time tomorrow, will the sea be a dreamlike smile? Or an angry roar?</p>
<p>The boatman raises the sail, leans against the ship, and gently exhales the day's hardships from the fine smoke of his pipe.</p>
<p>Further away are the white clouds. His hometown is still beyond the white clouds, where his wife and young children are, the cradle of dreams and hopes.</p>
<p>There is no sorrow in life, only the interweaving of sweat and waves. Who has so much free time to indulge in distant memories?</p>
<p>If only wings could grow from his back, so he could fly freely like a seagull!</p>
<p>The smoke curls, and beyond the smoke is a gray mist. On the other side of the lighthouse, is it an island? Is it the endless blue sea? Or the longed-for land?</p>

<p>— Zuo Rong</p>
<p>The train carried us to Tai'an, such a long and distant journey. Taking a rickshaw and walking was exhausting before we reached the right path up the mountain.</p>
<p>It was spring: the ground was covered with lush green grass and neatly growing wheat seedlings. The wind blew gently, creating ripples like water, which made people love it. The trees were showing new postures, and the lively atmosphere told people that they had awakened from the embrace of winter. The mountain scenery was very beautiful, making people think that what people said about Mount Tai was how good, how good, not exaggerated at all.</p>
<p>My younger brother started running and jumping as soon as he reached the First Heaven Gate, but I pulled him back. He was unhappy and pouted.</p>
<p>After passing a few old bent pine trees, apricot trees grew densely by the roadside. The mid-spring weather was the stage of youth at the bottom of the flowers – the flowers were blooming brilliantly, and butterflies and bees were flying in groups in the flowers, setting off the whole world into a poetic picture.</p>
<p>"Let's go, if you don't go, I'll run..."</p>
<p>My younger brother said, struggling to get out of my hands - run, we had no choice but to go. He was really annoying, jumping all the way, as if he didn't even know what he was going to do! Watching this person walking around noisily, and watching that person walking around noisily, and watching the immortal who has attained enlightenment – the dry bones and the fake head made into Sun Zhenren, he became interested, not only did he not walk around noisily, but his eyes stared straight at him - if the Taoist priest hadn't been watching there, he would have really stood up and touched him.</p>
<p>The waterfall under the Yunbu Bridge is really a beautiful picture, the water flows continuously from top to bottom, white like a silver chain. Sometimes the flow is too intense, and the splashed water stars are like silver shavings. There is light and sound, which makes people feel dazed there.</p>
<p>Along the way, children begging for money - some boys and some girls, all eight or nine years old, followed behind asking for money, shouting out skilled words in a clumsy Tai'an accent.</p>
<p>"Give me some money, young master, young lady! Give me some money..."</p>
<p>My younger sister and brother also shouted along, imitating very well, and even the children begging for money laughed.</p>
<p>The South Heaven Gate is like a temple, located so high in the sky that it is surprisingly high, making people worry first - how difficult it is to walk the "Eighteen Bends"! The road is a steep stone staircase, standing like a ladder to heaven. It makes people think: "No wonder it is called the Heaven Gate"!</p>
<p>In the house near the gate that used a large bowl for children to eat as a sign, after eating something and drinking a pot of tea, Dad bought some things for worshipping the gods and went to the top again.</p>
<p>In the temple of the Goddess of Mount Tai, after burning incense, Dad kowtowed to the statue of the god, touched his younger brother's head, and said softly and quietly:</p>
<p>"Yes, he is already so big"!</p>
<p>My younger brother just stared at the statue of the god, he didn't understand why?</p>
<p>I laughed at my younger brother -: This is the child that the Goddess of Mount Tai gave to Dad! An inexplicable mysterious meaning enveloped my heart.</p>
<p>In the shop where we had dinner, Dad woke us up in the middle of the night. The sky was still hanging with sparse stars, and we ran to the mountain. On the high hill behind the Wanghai Stone, we stared blankly at the foot of the mountain to the east. The surrounding mountains were all covered with the breath of smoke and fog. The wind brought the cold air of mid-spring to people, making them shiver.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Education and Nobility <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>Education is said to be a "noble" undertaking. Judging from the respect that country people have for scholars, it does indeed seem to be so. I don't know about other places, but in Shanghai, I feel that the word "noble" should be discounted a bit. The reason is not that Shanghai is a cultural center and there are too few places where scholars are respected, so the price drops automatically. It is actually because there are too many strange phenomena that the price has to drop.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each school season, advertisements for enrollment printed with Western-style houses can often be seen, and there seems to be wording like "thoughtful," which makes people very puzzled. What is even more puzzling are those so-called "alley primary schools" with one floor and one bottom. A house with one floor and one bottom has to be divided into several classrooms, teacher's lounges, and even a playground. Besides marveling at the precision of the calculation, there is nothing else to say.</p>
<p>But after a long time, knowing more, it becomes clear that those "alley primary schools" might as well be called "Confucius Says Shops" to be clear and straightforward, and it also turns out to be ordinary. Even the news about "schools and gambling tables" feels natural, since it is a "shop."</p>
<p>However, I still cannot help but be in awe of the news that someone filed a lawsuit because they were identified as a student. According to reports: The principal of Mushi English Night School was sued because "the school published a realistic enrollment advertisement stating that the plaintiff was a student, stating that after receiving education from this school, he was the principal of Mushi Night School, etc., but the plaintiff was a graduate of St. Francis." Therefore, he believed that it "affected his reputation and career" and filed a criminal self-suit, with an attached civil suit for 1,000 yuan. The other party, in addition to presenting various material and witness evidence to prove that the other party was indeed an English typing class student in the 19th year of the Republic of China, also filed a countersuit for slander, listing "betraying teachers" and other major crimes in the indictment.</p>
<p>What the result of this matter will be, the court will judge. But outside the scope of the law, one might as well talk about whether being someone's student "affects one's reputation and career"? And does publishing the student's promotion to principal in the enrollment advertisement also sufficiently prove the good achievements of the alma mater?</p>
<p>The principals probably admire Confucius, the "teacher of all generations," so Confucius said, "When three people walk together, there must be someone who can be my teacher." This shows that being a student does not "affect one's reputation and career." If Confucius were born in modern times, he might have gone to Mushi or Wushi Night School to take English lessons for the sake of need.</p>
<p>As for whether teachers are necessarily stronger than students? I remember that there is also a Chinese idiom called "The green comes from the blue but surpasses the blue," which shows that students are definitely not necessarily less successful than teachers, and the student's school is not necessarily weaker than the alma mater, which can also make people feel relieved. If teachers are always better than students, this world would never have gone from the Stone Age to the current Electric Age.</p>
<p>But why does one insist on identifying someone as a student, and the other insist on "betraying teachers"? To put it bluntly, it is very clear that both principals believe that teachers are necessarily superior to students.</p>
<p>Since schools take business as a premise, and peers are jealous of each other, the name of "teacher" and "student" is naturally something to be contended for, not to mention there are "tactics of using temptation, committing various acts of harming others and benefiting oneself" as a fuse?</p>
<p>But this also makes outsiders more clearly understand the so-called nobility of education!</p>

<p>My younger brother and sister couldn't see anything and were a little impatient—</p>
<p>"Let's go! Cold..."</p>
<p>Dad coaxed him.</p>
<p>"Look—isn't that coming out? In that red cloud, a red head is popping out..."</p>
<p>In the red cloud layer under the white clouds, the top of the fiery red sun was revealed. It was extremely beautiful! The sun's rays spread like electricity to the entire sky. Light occupied the universe. My younger brother called out happily. My younger sister smiled and said</p>

<p>Imported White Sugar</p>
<p>In late July 1936, smuggling was rampant, causing immense losses to all legitimate merchants and even bringing them to the brink of bankruptcy. In a small market town along a railway line in Jiangnan, there was a Demao native goods store. The owner, Li Desheng, felt very pained that smuggling was rampant and no one was eating domestic sugar. Therefore, he invited his peers to discuss effective ways to stop smuggling. His daughter, Huaying, was studying in Shanghai and was now at home for the summer vacation. She helped her father explain the harm of smuggling to the nation and the country, and advised conscientious merchants not to smuggle goods. Everyone organized an anti-smuggling group and said that Shanghai students would come down today to help them check for smuggled goods. At the meeting, Boss Wang was the most vocal against smuggling and the most enthusiastic about anti-smuggling, but it was known that he was secretly colluding with small railway station staff to transport and sell large quantities of smuggled goods. On this day, the imported white sugar and rayon transported from Shanghai were indeed found by Huaying's classmates. She slipped away quietly when she heard the bad news at the meeting. At this time, everyone at the meeting was extremely angry, unanimously saying that smugglers are our enemies, they want to cause us all to die! We will never eat smuggled imported white sugar. Whoever sells, buys, or eats it is not Chinese!</p>

<h3 id="e207">"As You Like It" Premieres Tonight <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The long-awaited literary masterpiece "As You Like It" has been scheduled to premiere tonight at 9:15 PM at the Grand Light Cinema. This is one of the most famous works of the great writer Shakespeare. Readers who have read Shakespeare's work know the story of this film. In terms of script preparation, this "As You Like It" brought to the screen retains the two major characteristics of literary films: first, the whole play is very faithful, it does not casually modify it like other literary films, so that they lose the original style and true essence: second, the dialogue of the characters in the play and the temperament of the whole play also maintain the original strong literary and poetic style. As for the leading actors, we dare to use the highest praise to introduce this European superstar - Elizabeth Bergner. In "As You Like It," she has a scene in almost every segment. Her superb, delicate, and warm acting skills, and her clear, flowing and rhythmic verses, are truly rare. In literary films, this is the most faithful and beautiful giant drama.</p>

<p>The new film company jointly established by veteran film stars Mary Pickford and Lasky has released its first production, "Stolen Kisses," which is now showing at the Greater Shanghai Theater. The film is a very light-hearted comedy. All the details of the play begin with a mistaken kiss in the theater, which results in a court trial. The man says that seeing such a beautiful girl, he couldn't help but feel the desire in his heart; the woman also pretends to be serious, half-heartedly accepts, so it goes, the plot is unspeakably wonderful. The stars are Fredric March and Hollywood beauty Ida Lupino, the protagonist of "The Adventures of Robin Hood." In addition to the film's humorous plot and light-hearted dialogue, the several popular songs in it are also very beautiful and moving.</p>
<h3 id="e209">"One Night of Folly" Screens at Cathay <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Starting today, the Cathay Theater is showing "One Night of Folly" Wives Never Know, starring the two major comedy stars, Charlie Ruggles and Marie Wilson. The film is produced by Paramount Pictures, and the plot is romantic and humorous, the performance is enthusiastic and compact, and it is indeed hilarious. These two stars are originally famous for acting in this kind of play, and they have made amazing gains in this film. In addition to the two of them, a famous comedian with a small mustache, Adolph Menjou, is also added, so the jokes are released non-stop like a string of beads.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Giving Away Autographed Photos of Chen Juanjuan <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Chen Juanjuan, China's only child star, once again took the lead in "Little Orphan Girl," performing with a new attitude, which caused a sensation across the country and bloomed a wonderful flower in the history of Chinese child stars. In the past two days, many people from all over the country have been asking for photos of Juanjuan. Juanjuan is extremely busy with filming and studying, and at the same time, there are too many people who want them, which is difficult to deal with, and it is impossible to send them one by one. Therefore, she entrusted the famous photographer Du Ao to take more than a hundred new poses of photos, and entrusted him to distribute them to all walks of life. Each photo is personally signed by Juanjuan, and a fee of five cents is charged for developing, printing, and postage. Those who love Juanjuan's art and do not yet have his photo can ask for it from Mr. Du Ao, No. 2954, Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, Shanghai.</p>
