<h3 id="c12">華北水災與水利問題 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 緯</p>
<p>近五年來。遍佈全國的大水災兩見。而遍佈全國的旱災一見。「日言治水。而水災不可防。日言水利。而旱災不可免。」這豈是國家之福。從水利之興廢。從水利機關之良窳。不獨可以覘一個國家農業的繁華與衰退。並且也可以覘一個國家國運的興隆與衰亡。單子過陳。見陳國的「澤不陂。」農事不修。人民荒嬉。而知陳之將亡。前三年巴黎文化合作院會員麥雷敎授。致我國中央硏究院院長蔡孑民先生函中。也謂「……凡文化將滅之先。另有衰亡徴象。人類控制環境之能力逐漸衰退。田園荒蕪。道路水渠等構築廢馳。災荒水患流行。而當局又無對伉之能力。」這雖不是針對我國而言。但是我國有許多觸目驚心的事實。使我們要再三體味這話的意義。比如我們去年因無控制水災的能力致使災區擴大。人民的遭受災害。在湘鄂兩省的災民。其數達七百萬以上。在魯省的災民。其數達五百萬以上。今年因災後春荒嚴重。吃樹皮草根者。時有所聞。今夏長江流域因爾水均調。如湘贛皖江浙等省。秋收可望豐收。然在黃河流域河水汎濫成災者。仍頻見報章。有漳河的水災。有潮河白河的水災。有永定河的水災。惟其面積。不過略較去年為少　。</p>
<p>就天時地利方面講。華北水災的防禦。自較不易。第一由於華北雨量。分配不勻。春冬秋三季。氣候乾亢。雨量極少。夏季雨量特多。故當夏季到來時。易成汎濫。第二華北為黃土層。黃土缺乏黏性。洗刷極易。而華北河流。又多挾泥沙。因此之故。河床皆高於河之兩岸。暴雨突來。河身常不能容納。因而容易發生水災。華北之水災頻見。此亦其重要原因之一。</p>
<p>此種自然條件。雖一時不易克服。然亦非絕對不可控制也。當然這不是一蹴可幾。吾人當有最大之努力。健全之水利組織。整個之水利計劃。雖然不能在短時期。達到控制自然的能力。但至少可以達到那避去那因人謀之不臧而所造成的災害。過去事實吿訴我們。水災之成。由於天時者常十之三。而由於人事者常十之七。如水利水政辦理之不善也。如水利事權之不統一也。如水利經費之短絀也。皆足以造成空前災區。往事不忘。來事之師。我們如果要防止水災。我們應先對水利的機構加以注意。因為有了一個健全的水利機構。我們才能有受制自然的力量。而達防止水災的目的。這是一個必要的而首先必須解決的問題。</p>

<p>— 本報記者胡仲詩　　胡一臧</p>
<p>（七）兩個新聞王國</p>
<p>遊過了古典的歷史的大阪城，我們要到現代日本的兩個新聞王國去。這個誇張的名稱，是有些日本人給予「大阪朝日」和「大阪每日」的。就資本的雄厚，聲勢的浩大來說，這兩家報館的確可以壓倒全國其他的報館，左右日本大多數國民的思想了。前者統轄着東京日日，在全國其他的大都市，還都遍設着規模不小的支社和支局。最近聽說日本各地魄力較大的地方報也漸漸有着歸附到這兩大新聞系統的趨向了。如新愛知新聞之於朝日，名古屋新聞之於每日便是一個例子。近代日本資本主義的發展使全國的產業都有集體化的傾向。不僅新聞業是如此。大家知道當今日本最大的兩個財閥三井和三菱，不但在全國工商業的重要部門都佔有莫大的勞力，就是都市上的大百貨店和大戲館也往往不出這兩大財閥的系統。有人說，大阪朝日代表着三井系的與論機關，大阪每日則代表着三著作的。從兩報的態度上看來，這番話不無幾分可信吧。</p>
<p>在中之島的大阪朝日新聞社，和在堂島的大阪每日新聞社是隔橋相望的。這兩個報館，上一天晚間我們都去訪問過。因為他們主要的辦公時間在午後不在晚上，我們所遇到的兩報的職員都約我們到次日午後三點鐘去正式參觀。我們走出大阪城，時間還早，任領事便邀我們先到大阪朝日新聞誇稱為藝術的殿堂的朝日會館去吃些茶點。朝日會館是一所黝黑色直綫型的六層大厦（地下室除外）矗立在大阪朝日新聞社白色橫綫型的十層社屋的旁邊，愈加顯出近代建築的壯麗來。四層以上的公演塲，容得下一千七百的看客，通常映演着電影，或者舉行着演講，跳舞，戲劇能樂之類；三層的展覽塲時常開着各種藝術展覽會。二層是事務室和吃茶店，一層的裏面部分和社屋相通，做着朝日新聞的印刷塲和發送塲，表面部分則開着百貨店。從那裏上了樓，在濟滿着人們的廣大的吃茶室裏，我們同任領事圍着一張小小的玻璃面的圓檯，喝了些咖啡和紅茶。於是快到三點鐘了。我們別了任領事，走進所要參觀的朝日新聞社正屋去。</p>
<p>一進門就是營業局的廣大的辦公廳。長列的黑色人造石櫃檯的後面坐着幾十個忙忙碌碌的職員，其中五六個年靑活潑的女性在近門的一端，擔任着「受付」（收養）的職務。她們接了外面送來的什麽稿件或是信件，先在一張表格上登記下來，接着把那收件放在眞空運送機上革製的圓简裏，靠機械的作用送達到樓上的什麽部分。我們訪友的名片也用同樣的手續送到了編輯局。於是一個學生裝的童子走來，引導我們上樓去。</p>

<h3 id="c93">西班牙動亂的展望 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>西班牙全國現在陷於劇烈的混戰中了。這决動亂不但是國內政治鬥爭的問題，而且關係着歐洲的全局。現在請就這次動亂的近因，槪括地來說明一下。</p>
<p>西班牙人民陣綫自從在二月的選舉中獲得勝利後，法西斯派和右派各黨幾無日不在圖謀再度奪取政權。到了本月十二日西班牙保王黨領袖索台爾被刺，西班牙的政局就更陷於動盪不安的狀態中。法西斯派政變的陰謀，每天必有數起破獲，這次於十八日發動的西班牙屬地摩洛哥戍軍和國內一部分軍隊的叛變，就是保王黨和法西斯黨事前擬定的計畫。照他們的預定，先在摩洛哥發動，繼在國內起事，然後會合直趨首都。現在，內戰正劇烈地進行着，形勢雖還無從判明，但雙方的陣綫却是十分顯明：一面是佔西班牙人口百分之八十的農工大衆所支持的人民陣綫。一面是包括了王黨，法西斯黨以及大地主資本家的叛軍，背後據說還有意，德，法西斯蒂為之撐腰。西班牙的入民陣錢與法西斯蒂已到了大决鬥的關頭、西班牙已踏上了歷史進程中一個必然的階段了。</p>
<p>西班牙自一九三一年爆發了空前的革命，把一二千年的皇座推翻，建立了新的共和制度以來，已有整整的五年了。在這五年當中，西班牙的革命運動在艱苦的過程中進展着，農民的騷動，工人的罷工示威，喀泰隆那，巴斯克，阿斯多利亞各地被壓迫民族的自治運動，簡直沒有一天停止過。這是因為共和政府不能解决社會經濟和民族問題上的種種矛盾，帝制雖被推翻，地主的勢力依然很堅固，農民依然過着最貧苦的非人生活，少數民族的解放依然沒有實現，勞工的地位依然沒有改善——據估計失業人數竟違百萬之譜。社會和民族的矛盾旣這樣的尖銳，自然深切地反映到政治上繼續的不安。</p>
<p>原來過去歷决共和政府大多是操在資產集團的右派手中的，在革命的威脅之下，這種政權更加速的右傾。一九三三年九月以前，雖一度出現較「左」的阿柴那內閣，但不久卽被推倒。阿柴那是左翼共和黨的首領，在他的統治之下，曾經沒收了一些貴族的田地，略略實施士地分配的改良，遂引起了貴族和大地主的不滿。繼阿柴那而起的是代表財政資本集團的勒樂，但勒樂不久又被左翼各黨聯合陣綫所推翻，繼之者是軟弱無能的散卑爾，因左右兩派鬭爭的劇烈，散卑爾內閣未幾卽被擠塌，法西斯派重復把勒樂捧上了台，動樂在右派積極支持之下，曾以鐵腕政策鎮壓一九三四年十月的革命。其後並由「西班牙的希特勒」盧下爾斯任陸軍部長，這樣西班牙的政權更走上了法西斯的道路了。到了去年九月，法西斯黨又對勒樂表示不滿，數度改組內閣，由浦田泰而却巴潑里達，而伐拉達萊，都不過是法西斯黨的傀儡，這伐拉達萊內閣到今年二月中，由於人民陣綫在大選中的勝利而被推倒。</p>
<p>西班牙人民陣綫的勝利央不是偶然的事，而是西班牙客觀形勢和各階層各政派的聯合戰綫政第成功之必然的結果。人民陣綫的力量愈進展。反動政黨的聯合進攻也必愈劇烈，這大槪是社會鬥爭發展必然的「邏輯」，這次保王黨和法西斯黨挑動的有計畫的大叛變，正反映了西班牙人民陣綫的力量。在這次叛軍與政府軍對峙中，我們看見農工大衆都紛紛組織了自己的民團，英勇地奮身作政府的後盾，從這又可見到人民陣綫民眾基礎的深厚。在廣大的民衆支持之下。我們覺得西班牙人民陣綫是决不至於完全失敗的。固然，西班牙右派的叛軍在國際法西斯的合力支持之下，也許一時有取現政府而代之的可能，到那時候，意德必將伺隙利用時機，國際形勢必將為之一趨。不過，以它內部矛盾的深刻，以西班牙大多數人民對它的憎恨，這種可能卽使實現，亦未必能够持久的。</p>

<p>— 許曉初</p>
<p>在二十年前日本人穿西服的很少，現在已是大不相同了。西裝服用便利，且易於表現精神，自然穿的人日漸增多。但是日本人穿的西裝原料，都是日本貨。所以穿西裝並不是一定不愛國敞表現，而勸人提倡國貨的，也不一定要開倒車勸人不要穿西裝。最要緊的還是趕快設法製造各種西裝原料，這不過是比方的話。一切國貨都可照此推論，如此順應潮流的提倡，與逆潮流的提倡相較，收效那是大不相同的了。否則徒以愛國的美名，勉强抑制人民的慾望，使其服用本人所不樂用的物品，縱能收效於一時，那是絕對不能持久的。若是我們提倡國貨，完全採取這種辦法，敢說一輩子不會成功。所以因勢利導，迎合潮流，投人所好，都是國貨廠商在『標準化』的信條之下，應該特別注意的。貨物精良耐用，迎合時代心理，是為推銷上的基本條件。而宣傳和分配，也决不可以忽視，記得某日在友人家得見湖南何鍵主席贈給的建華公司出品燒料瓷瓶一對，花樣色澤非常可愛，另一友人欲向市中購得之，不意走遍南京路各大公司及國貨商店瓷器店，竟統通買不到。又在上海市商會商品陳列所內看見有幾種女式蒲　，為寗波出產，著色別緻、式樣美覜，據個人所見，此種蒲扇，定為摩登仕女所樂用，並且可以行銷洋莊。又如安慶竹蓆，編製異常精美，决不在台灣蓆之下，售價又較之特別低廉，可惜市中都還不易買到。類乎這種情形的，不知有多少，所以宜傳和推銷之不得法，亦為經售國貨者一大缺點，凡我國貨廠商，對於此點，不能不深切的注意。</p>
<p>以上都是對我們國貨廠商而霄，至於應如何糾正國人對於國貨的錯誤心理，亦為提倡國貨　中最重要的一點。往往聽見人說，「東洋貨不及西洋貨。國貨不及東洋貨，」雖不能說國人偭僩都存有這種心理，但是可以斷言必不在少數。說來眞可惱，越是經濟能力厚的人，換言之，越是生活程度高的，所謂上流社會的人，越是服用國貨的成份少，所以國貨的行銷，倒以中下級社會為最多。這其中不知還是因為中下級社會資力不足，生活簡單，只好樸實點用用國貨，還是比較的國家觀念濃厚點。我們最易見到的就是上流社會所吸的紙烟，不管是在上海在南京，或在別的地方，不管何種職業或性別，拿出來一看，不是加力克，三砲台，定是黑貓，三五，紋盤牌，似乎非此不足以表示闊綽，又似乎拿出國貨白金龍，好運道’美麗，金鼠，等牌為可羞恥的樣子。尤其可憐的，例如當貴闊戶的太太小姐們，妝閣所陳列的化妝品，幾乎無一不是舶來品。似乎陳列國貨化妝品於妝台之上為不雅觀，卽使實際上使用國貨，也只藏之於橱內，不肯公然陳列在外面。若是無知無識的人們的行為如此，倒還罷了，差不多知識階級份子，也還不能例外，你看傷心不傷心。國人如此「言不由衷」的提倡國貨，氾不知那年方可正式收效，</p>
<p>可以　到提倡國貨，本人主張，在廠商方面，應該（一）力謀貨品的改良精進，適合時代的需要。（二）注意宣傳和推廣，（三）多辦國貨公司和國貨展覽會，使生產界與消費者，得獲接觸機會。至於在國民方面，則應改變錯誤之觀念，尊重國貨樂用國貨以為國民提倡團貨心理上的建設。能如此，則國貨界欣欣向榮，可以預期。而國家之經濟命脈，和民旗前途之危機，始可藉以挽回。否則經濟亡國，其速更勝於武力亡國。本人亦為經營國貨事業之一份子，願與諸君共勉之。（完）</p>

<p>（二）意義</p>
<p>近代亞林匹克復興的功人寇佩汀氏，闡明亞林匹克運動會的原旨如下：</p>
<p>「亞林匹克運動會的恢復，在近代生活狀况之下，每四年使世界各國民衆集聚一次，信賴和平與禮讓的競賽，可以組織國際主義的無上形式。</p>
<p>「一切之前，可在競技運動中保存過去所使人崢嶸的種種高貴豪俠的特質，在今代人民敎育地位上，享受古代希臘人民敎育所使人欽慕的同等地位。</p>
<p>「競技漸漸散佈於全世界，並已代替靑年生活不健全的娛樂與有害的遊蕩，人之在社會，必有其特種缺陷，眞正的競技運動，可使消滅其罪惡，以促進健全的民族精神。</p>
<p>「亞林匹克觀念，進至何種程度，當難判斷，但從其發軔的各方面觀之，其定義之深，已很明顯：（一）創造並增强文明國家和平聯絡的友誼關係。（二）澄淸並消滅競技運動中之自私與欺詐的手段，尋求人人能得公正判斷的遊技，並使競賽不是以勝利作靑年的歡樂。</p>
<p>「總之，世界亞林匹克運動會，具有社會敎育與道德的之目標：社會方面使人於相互之間，能有了解精神。敎育方面：（一）使體育敎育發達到積極與有理性的發展。（二）設立公共遊戲塲。道德方面：（一）運動應具的精神，（二）羣衆的運動。總而言之，在護持提倡純萃的業餘運動。歷年之專心致志者在者。</p>

<p>— 海帆</p>
<p>所得稅濫觴於英。時為一七九八年。所以應付英法戰爭之戰費也。其後美國於一八六一年。因南北戰爭而有合衆團所得稅法之制定。德國於一九二〇年。因虎後財政之窘迫亦採行所得稅。法國則始於一九一四年大戰爆發之前夕。意國則始於一八六四年帝國甫經成立之時。俄國則始於一九一六年戰費鉅客支出及稅收减少之際。日本亦因海軍之擴張及北海道物產稅之必須减輕。遂於一八八七年毅然採用，他若荷蘭瑞士奧匃等國亦經先後施行。其間過程。雖不無變故。要其動機。為應付戰時經濟及財政上之革新或困難則一也。時至今日，所得稅之進展。已成世界化。其數額於各國我入之中。且估一極大地位矣。今試就一九三二年各國所得稅與其稅收總額之百分比率。當能瞭然。</p>
<p>所得稅於稅收之重要旣如斯。我國以前未言不注意及之。遜清末葉。即有所得稅之擬定。民國成立。財政部重提新案。於二年擬定條例。三年一月公布。後以範圍　泛。徵敢不易。未見實行。民四民十曾兩度公怖施行細則。限令實行。亦終因國內多故。未獲威　。十六年民政府成立。對所得稅會祥加規劃。十八年將民三所得稅條例終正公怖。施行細則亦經改盯。然結果仍未得實效。近年以還。政府　於財政支絀。乃於二十四年訂成所得稅暫行條例三十一條。並於二十四年度總預算案歲入項下列入所得稅五百萬元。迨年度終了。依然毫無結果。以上所述。我國所得稅歷史上之槪略，且從未切實徵收者也。考其所以不能實行之故。的有數端。縷舉如。（未完）市價</p>

<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>小朋友們，署假已經開始了，從固定的學校課程裏解放了出來，如釋重負，現在又可以享受的有兩個月悠長的假期，你們一定覺得非常快活的吧！</p>
<p>但諸位却要想想，假期有兩個月，倘若完全白讓它空過了去，那是很不經濟的，——光陰要比金錢更貴重呢！下面的幾伴事情，希望小朋友們照我的辦了：</p>
<p>（一）補習不及格的功課　你們在校裏，不是有一二科功課認為很難懂的嗎？上决期考時，不是有一二個科目，幾乎或者竟然不及格的嗎？這就因為你平素認為難懂而有畏難的念頭，不曾好好地用心記誦過的緣故，所以臨到大考時發生恐慌，考不出來，這就足以帶累了你的別項功課，把你的平均分數减低了。如果不及格的功課太多，還要帶累你留級或者降起級來呢！我勸你不要慌，你可以利用這假期來補習這幾門功課，在父母兄姊的指導之下，動動懇懇的溫習起來。那怕它如何困難，也終要給你成功的。</p>
<p>（二）閱看一些有益的書本那些期考各科都及格的小朋友們，除仍須消習功課之外，可以閱看一些有價值的讀物，如世界名人傳，科學家傳等等，至於其他小說童話和故事之類，最好請由你的父兄介紹給你們看。那些神怪荒謬的書本，看了毫無益處，槪以不看為宜。報紙每天要看。</p>
<p>（三）練習寫作和友人通信在校裏有作文一科，有時是由先生出的題目，有時是自由題，這都可以使你的國文進步，思想靈活的方法。在假期中，作文可以照常舉行，做點記事文也可以，做點討論文也可以，父給父兄關看，倘若你們喜歡繪畫的，在假期更可多多的學繪。假期中和同學們暫時分開，可利用通信方法和他們談話，這也能使你的國文進步的。</p>
<p>上面三項事情，我知道你們定能照辦。但也不要太過用功，游戲的時間也不可少。我以為溫習和寫作的時間最好定在淸晨六時至九時左右，這時天氣比較凉快點，不致太累。功課做好應該休息和游戲，有餘的時間要帮媽媽做點家庭裏的小工作，因為媽媽太辛苦了。</p>
<p>這樣，我們纔可以說沒有空過了這悠長的假期！</p>
<h3 id="c220">可畏的夏日 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 婉文</p>
<p>人們所嚴惡的夏日，一天天利害起來，熱烘烘地，遍照着大地，使精神飽滿的人們疲倦，綠色成陰的樹葉枯萎，美麗可愛的花兒倒垂，但是它，任你們厭惡，到一定的時候，仍很驕傲地站在那裏。</p>
<p>有錢的人們，也敵不住夏日的威脅，便在家中，吃着冷食，開着電風扇，逍遙自在，除非那些農夫們，還是在熱烈的日光下工作，把皮膚曬成黑而起了泡，但他們為了生存，不得不如此。</p>
<p>活潑的昆蟲，也知道日光的利害，都躱避起來，只有幾隻美麗的蝴蝶，在比較弱些陽光下的花叢中無力地跳舞，和柳榭上的知了，一聲聲地尖悅的呌聲。</p>

<p>小朋友！我們餘讀書學習之外，還應該自己動手，創造些東西出來！不但覺得十分有趣，而且足以發現我們小朋友的聰明智慧呢。像瓦特小時候便研究科學，後來被他發明了許多東西。小朋友，我們快來發明吧！</p>
<p>這幾天，是炎熱的天，有買冰的小孩，向他買一塊大冰，製造各種科學的玩具吧！</p>
<p>（一）三稜鏡　三稜鏡是用三角形的玻璃柱，日光透過這三角形的玻璃後，卽分出一條美麗的七色光帶來。可是，買一隻三稜鏡很貴。我們用冰來做一隻玩玩吧。你可以拿厚的冰，把它放在熱的爐上。做成長的正三角形。然後拿到日光下，最好是投進室內的日光。使日光透過三角形的冰柱後，你就能在壁上看見一條美麗的七色光帶，和天空現的虹一樣的美麗。倘若一時得着這樣的美麗光帶。那未，不必急。你只須稍稍轉動你手裏的三角冰柱，使日光透過後，剛能落在壁上，現出七色光帶來，就行了</p>
<p>（二）凸透鏡　拿一塊又乾净又厚（須十分透明）的冰來，把它做中央厚邊緣薄的圓形。你可以好好的放在熱的爐上做，這工作很有些小困難，然而你如果細心做，一定能做出一面好凸透鏡。這面凸透鏡做好之後，你便可以拿來玩了。第一，你可以把它當擴大鏡用，用它去看書，書上的小字放得很大。你還可以用它來看別的小束西。但有些糢糊不明，自然不及玻璃所做的凸透鏡。</p>
<h3 id="c222">口渴 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 陸國維</p>
<p>小朋友們，夏天已經來了，天氣一天比一天熱；額上時常淌着汗；嘴裏時常覺得很渴，雖然喝了此茶水，隔了片刻口又渴了，不比冬天時候，一天只要喝一些茶水就够了，這不是很神秘而奇怪嗎？假使小朋友們願意知道這個啞謎，那麼我們大家一同來研究這口渴的問題。</p>
<p>（一）為什麼要口渴？我們人的身體裏，含有許多水份。這水份是替我們洗滌體內各器官用的，洗滌過後的水，就變成汗和尿排洩到體外去，這時體內因為缺少了水份，就不得不求新的水份來補充。因此我們就覺得口渴了。不過為什麼在夏天，口更容易渴呢？道是因為夏天天氣熱，身體內排出許多汗，這汗的功用是减低體溫和抵抗外熱，因為汗出的多，所以就時常鬧口渴了。</p>
<p>（二）應當怎樣解渴？假使說我們要使長時期不口渴而飲大量的水，這是不對的，因為我們身體內只要吸收一定量的水份，多剩的茶水一點功用都沒有，而徒然增加汗量，所以茶水不宜多喝，也不宜快喝。最好是慢慢地喝，不必多喝，還有一個很好的渴水法介紹給小朋友們，就是把茶水盛在小口的瓶裏或是尖嘴的茶壺裏。喝的時候，使茶水成一條綫樣流到咽喉裏去。這是西班牙南方在田裏工作的農夫發明的。如此可以用少量的茶水來止渴，豈不便利嗎？</p>
<p>（三）什麽時候應當喝水和應當喝什麼飲料？在渴的時候就應當喝，這是不用說的。並且因為各人體質和工作的不同，不能指定多少時間纔宜喝水。不過有一點要請注意：就是在飯後不宜多喝，多喝是要妨碍消化的。至於飲料問題，最好的飲料當然是煮沸過的白開水。茶和咖啡，在成年人喝些是沒有多大害處的。不過小朋友們。我勸你們還是喝白開水最相宜些。</p>

<p>— 卞北辰</p>
<p>白亮耀眼的電燈光，很會影響人們夏夜的睡眠和工作，所以，在夏季有一般人都將白燈泡換上天藍泡，因為它色澤藍得柔和幽雅，頗易引起人們睡眠時的甜適，促成身體的健康</p>
<p>假使我們到電料店去購買，每隻代價大槪三四角左右，但是電料店所出售的天藍泡，亮度最小的是五十支光。如果一個家庭裏裝了三盞二十五支光的電燈，到了夏天換上三隻五十支光的天藍泡，假定每天每一電燈開四小時的話，那末一個月便要增加一元多電費的支出！</p>
<p>因此，我們要求電費支出的减少，需要自製光度較小的天藍泡。</p>
<p>自製的天藍泡製法很簡單，祗須到藥房裏買一瓶克羅丁」，（卽賽璐珞溶液）再到顏料店裏或烟紙店買幾個銅元洋藍，倒入賽璐珞溶液內攪和，顏色的深淡視自己需要而定，然後再取自己所適合光度的燈泡，浸入賽璐珞溶液和洋藍所攬勻的液體內卽取出，風乾後卽可應用。</p>

<p>先用一張草紙，將芭蕉扇擦一遍！不然字寫不上—便可用筆任意書書，寫畢，再燃洋燭一支—洋燈亦可—將扇子有字畫的一面，在離火燄寸許的地方，慢慢的熏去，熏畢，再用清水洗凈，於是，便顯出很美麗的黑底白字子。假使再在上面自己題幾句詩，或是格言，那不是雅觀了嗎？倘若再寫好自己的名字，那麼可以防止遺失了。</p>

<p>— 小哥哥</p>
<p>小朋友們，在夏天時候，我想信你們不論那一個，對於打雷都多少總有些怕吧。不差，打雷是件可怕的事。不過假使我們能知道打雷的地方距離我們所在地尚且很遠，就一點不用害怕。反之，若是很近，那麼我們就應當設法躱避，所以最緊要的事就是要知道打雷的地方和自己的遠近。這測騐遠近的方法很簡單：只要自看見閃電後起，立刻把左手三指，（食指，中指，無名指。）按在右手大拇指根下，測騐脈搏的跳動數目，直到聽見雷聲為止。隨後把測得的脈搏跳動數，剩上三百四十，就可以告訴你，打雷地方離開你多少距離。例如，你見閃電後脈搏跳動五次後纔聽到雷聲。那麽打雷的地方距離你5×340＝700。公尺外的二公里。（還很遠呢，可以一點不用怕。）</p>
<p>小朋友，你們不是覺得這計算法很奇怪嗎？其實一說明以後，就沒有什麼奇怪了。因為聲音的速度是每秒走三百四十公尺，脈搏每跳一次費去時間約一秒。所以老是拿上面的例子來購，脈搏跳動五次，就是說雷聲傳到你的耳朶裏一共經過五秒鐘。又依據物理學上的定理說聲音的速度是每秒三百四十公尺，所以這雷聲在五秒鐘後傳到你耳膜上所經進的路程是5×340＝1700換一句話講，就是說打雷的地方和你的距離是1700公尺。這便是測騐打雷距離方法的原理。</p>

<p>— 馮德孚</p>
<p>天氣在一天一天熱起來了，一切流行性的病菌也漸漸地活動着開始它們殺人的工作；所以我們對於這時期的一切起居飲食，都要特別的留心和格外的消潔。</p>
<p>關於飲的方面：汽水，的確是最衛生而也有益於身體敞，所以為一般人士們所樂飲；尤其是小朋友們，更喜歡的了不得。那末我們應該自己來製造；可以作為一種遊戲，來消磨這悶熱的夏天。</p>
<p>下面是自製汽水的簡單方法：</p>
<p>材料—重炭酸達五分，檸檬酸三分，清水十二兩。用具—瓶一個（最好已用過的汽水瓶），戳子一個。製法—先把淸水煮沸，等它凉透了，卽灌在一個可容納</p>
<p>十二兩的汽水瓶裏，再稱重炭酸曹達五分，裝入水瓶內，用手掌把瓶口握緊，上下搖動，使它溶化了，再稱檸檬三分，加入瓶裏，然後急將瓶蓋塞住，最須注意的，就是不要使它出氣。這種手續完了，卽將汽水瓶倒放着，一會兒，自製的汽水便成功了！如果我們要它味甜，可以加入幾粒糖—普通的砂糖也可—我們還想使它味香，也可隨便加點香料，像市上所賣的香蕉油，橘子油……加一小滴卽可。最後一句語，就是在製造之前，務須將雙手及用具洗淸，以免有甚麽細菌混入汽水內，而致發生疾病。</p>
<p>小朋友們，我們如能照上面的方法做去，便和市上所買的汽水一樣的昧美可口了，大家來試試罷。</p>

<p>在黃頭髪的華樂誕生的那年，他的父親就去世了。他登了王位，竟做了國王，這要算是一位從未見過的小王了。他頭上戴着王冠，重重的使他頭腦作痛。他那悲哀的母親微笑着說，他必須學得怎樣做一個聰明的國王。如此他就得學習幾千百種的功課才是。每逢十位敎師想把書本和算數裝到他的腦袋裏去時，他却往往抬眼望着窗外，瞧那天氣的種種演變。呀，他是這樣的渴想着跑到門外去，置身於風霜雨雪之下！</p>
<p>有天，黑頭髮的華樂正看守着他的羊羣，坐在那高高的山坡上，吹着笛子，伴他的寂寞，忽地來了一頭挺大的猛狗。華樂的那頭忠心的牧羊狗頓時豎起了它的兩耳，喉嚨裏低低的咆哮起來，那猛狗在地上飛掠過來，就在這一瞬之間，兩頭狗已相撲在一起了。華樂吃了一驚，將他的杖用力地打開它們，然而雙方都不肯讓步。幸而有四個騎士鞭着馬，趕將上來，原來他們都是那小王的衛士。</p>
<p>那四人中一個身材最高的開口說道：『孩子，我們在這裏，你得小心一些。你的狗要是傷害了主上的愛狗，那是於你不利的。</p>
<p>黑頭髮的華樂憤憤的答道：『這是你們的狗的不是！它先來攻打我的狗呀！』</p>
<p>那人很粗暴的叱道：『快快肅靜！王上來了。你這無禮的孩子，快向王上深深的鞠躬』！</p>
<p>這時黃頭發的華樂已騎着馬趕來了。那黑髮的華樂從沒有見過這樣一幅美的畫圖，原來他一見了那富麗堂皇的小王，簡直驚異得喘不過氣來。那小王身穿一件銀邊藍天鵝絨的華服，直照得眼前發亮。他那黃金髮的頭上，更戴着一頂亮晶晶地黃金的王冠。</p>
<p>那小王柔聲說道：我很歡喜，『你的狗沒有受傷。你養了它有多少時候了？』</p>

<p>小朋友，在這夏天，有一種燈，可以不花錢，而且不會灼痛手指，擔着非常好玩，確是小朋友們夜裏乘凉時候的好玩具，我來敎你們做吧。</p>
<p>（材料，）（一）鹹鴨蛋壳一枚，不要用刀切開，拿來放到有亮光處照一照，揀虛空一頭，對着檯子，輕輕撞幾下，再把頭上撞破的壳，好好刺去，有了洞，便好用筷子把裏面的蛋挖出來吃了，挖時當心，要挖乾净，不要把壳弄破。（二）綿綫一根，有一尺就够了。（三）白玻璃紙一小張，或白桑皮紙亦可。（四）一尺長小篾扞一校。（用具，）小剪刀一把，漿糊小許，你們材料用具都預備好了，就好動手做了。</p>
<p>用剪刀把蛋究破頭剪平，再把那一頭也剪平，成一鼓形，（注意此頭剪時，先用剪尖揷一小洞，就好着剪了，）再將壳腰正中揷一小洞，如豌豆大，如圖（一），再把篾打尖頭剪下三分長，用綫結牢，如圖（二）把錢頭山蛋內穿出洞外，然後把蛋壳兩頭，用預備的紙糊好，再剪紙一小方，如圖（三），穿到綫上，蓋住蛋腰小洞，再將綫端結到篾扦上，那麼燈就成功了，如圖（四），最好有彩筆在紙上畫點圖案，或國徽，那就更好看了，燈做好之後，裏面不是不能燃燭嗎，沒有亮光，不是不好玩嗎，我們就因為有特別發光的東西，才做這盞燈，這樣東西，是晋朝家貧苦讀的朋友車胤發明的，就是螢火虫，祗要在曠野有草的地方，在夜裏都可以找得着，我們用扇子捉幾個放進燈裏去，就是一盞亮晶晶的燈了，而且一閃一閃的，很有美術意味，非常好玩。</p>
<p>螢，是一種小虫，怎樣能發光呢，告訴你們吧，它的尾端，有個發光器；它呼吸時，空氣傳入，就會生起養化作用，而發光了，它還能帮我們捕食田裏的害虫，它是大有益我們農作的益虫啊。</p>

<p>職業婦女的自白</p>
<h3 id="c233">女記者 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣逸霄女士談</p>
<p>在蜿蜒嵯峨的九龍山下，明淨澄澈的芙蓉江畔，恬靜而又酣適地躺着一個極小的村鎭，名呌作「陳墅」，那便是我的故鄕。</p>
<p>我是生長在無錫境內一個本來頗富裕而後來中落破敗的家庭之中。我祖父在洪楊之亂以後經營商業，很積蓄了一點錢，創置了一點田地房產，在那小村鎭上也算很說得上的一家。但我父親是讀書出身，而生性又慈祥懦弱，因此承受了祖父的遺產之後，不但不能保持，而且做任何生意都是虧折賠累，到我十二三歲的時候，我的家庭，已經到了十分黯淡悽慘的境地了，雖到表面上還是要極力支撐，維持着那虛偽的面子。</p>
<p>我藉着母親的一點私蓄與師友們的熱心援助，得由小學而中學，由中學而大學，以至於畢業。我不知怎樣也能在這非錢不行的社會中度過了十幾年艱難困苦的學生生活？現在想起來，眞有點茫然！而又有點驚訝！</p>
<p>在我說到我從業的經過之前，不得不先說一說我當年進大學時所懷的一種抱負。在中學畢業的時候年紀很靑，對於人世一點沒有認識，血管裏流着的是沸騰的熱血，腦筋裏裝滿着的是美妙的幻想。眞所謂不知「天有多高，地有多厚」的時代。凡是理想所及的，總以為自己只要有勇氣，能夠努力向前走，决不至於不會　之於事實。就在這樣的情況之下，我投進了大學理科的化學系；因為我那時候，自己抱負很高，說得誇大一點，眞有「方今天下，舍我其誰」之槪。對於學習文科，硏究些空虛的理論，寫幾篇無裨實用的文字，很看不起，覺得那樣决救不了中國的貧弱。學了化學呢？我要發明多少日用品，開辦工廠自己製造，不但自己能獲利，而且還可以抵制舶來貨，為國家挽回不少外溢的金錢；在我發了財之後，我就可以創辦許多有益於社會的事業，學校，醫院，工塲，慈善機關……。這樣一個理想的樂園，建造在我那時的縹渺空虛的心意中，使我永遠很高興而且很感趣味的在大學中苦心攻讀了化學四五年。</p>
<p>然而，在畢業以後呢？那不可捉摸的現實社會總是有種種的牽制，使我不能照我的理想去做。無論我怎樣想做一回「自我主張」的夢，而這個夢却一直沒有降臨。生活的鞭策便把我趕到簪筆傭書的敎育界中，而且，所敎的功課大部是國文，小部是數學。如此單調的蟄居伏處，理頭粉筆黑板之間，計有十年左右，有九年在天津，一年在北平。那時，陰靈的氣氛籠罩着華北，而南方的怒潮也還沒有甚麽奔騰的力量。我雖然頗不甘於那種刻板的生活，但也不能不坐以待時，因此，河北省立水產專科學校和弘德中學便暫時成為我枝棲之處。但我的寄託旣不能付之於事業，便只有發之於文字了。並且，這也是我以後從事於報人生活的動機。</p>
<p>我最初所寫的文字，散篇的關於婦女問題的很不少，多半登載在國聞週報，質的方面，以翻譯者為多。這是在民國十五年左右的事。到十六年，曾出單行本小說「錄箋」一册，是用書信體裁，注重於心理的分析，雖然是一本寫愛情的小說，却也包含着一個值得注意的婦女問題。那時國聞週報的編者何心冷先生常常鼓勸我寫作，使我對於各項社會問題的硏究與發表議論更感興趣。便在民國十七年北伐成功時約在六七月間正式做了新聞記者，為天津大公報擔任本埠新聞的採訪和編輯部分的職務，開始寫作關於天津職業婦女生活調査的文字。</p>
<p>我是一個富於好奇心的人，在學校中學化時倒還能給我一些新鮮的玩意弄弄，等到把光陰完全消磨到敎讀生涯，便使我大感痛苦，因此，我精神上身體上受了不少的影響。雖然曾經得在北平養了一年病，但身體總是不能如在學校中讀書時那樣活潑健康了。只有在我開始服務於大公報的時候，因生活突然轉變，精神也為之一振。單就訪問天津職業婦女生活狀况一項而說。卽工作了一年多沒有懈怠。每日在十字街頭跑來跑去，不管是拂着和煦的春風，或者曬着酷熱的太陽與淋着暴烈的夏雨，或者伴着蕭蕭的落葉以及踏着寒冷的冰雹，我總是一年四季興緻濃厚地度着日子。我自己知道我對於一切事情本無常性，但從事於這每天都是千變萬化的報人生活，却是我唯一嗜好的獲得。所可恨的就是我的身體不免要常常需要修養！到了去年，我又奉了母親從天津南下，回到故鄕休息了好些時。這也可以作為我生活的一次調劑。</p>
<p>我對於做事，尤其是對於我極感興趣的新聞事業，我下得有一個决心！我覺得我這個人自信力很強，凡事喜歡直截痛快的明瞭它的眞相。在我擔任着採訪工作時，我可以實際地看到下層勞苦羣衆以及富裕者的相反生活，社會內層的詳細情形，從好奇心出發而能使我不隔膜社會生活，至少，我可以在一些機會裏儘量暴露現實，以供負改革推動社會之責的人們的參考。</p>
<p>看不見的鎖鍊牢繫着我國的婦女！幾千年來婦女問題的瘡結究竟何在？對於這問題，儘管有人在那裏主張這樣運動那樣運動，但這根深蒂固的鎖鍊却仍然要把那唱高調不務實際的首先拖下來。所以，在我個人的經騐看來，是必須要從調査暴露方面入手，知道了病根才可對症下藥。為了做這一向情願的工作，我至今沒有想到組織家庭！除了為侍養一位母親起見，我只是許身於我的報導工作。</p>
<p>民國二十三年，我曾經在國聞週報發表過一篇自傳似的文字，呌「幼年時代」，那便是我自己家庭和個人的寫實報導。最近，我是近於壯年時代了，但我覺得報導全社會婦女的家庭和每個人的生活，豈不更比單純地寫我自己來得更普遍更完全嗎？而且就是對於我自己，也是切切實實地在這一工作之中增加了我無限的認識和經歷呢。</p>
<p>上海大公報本市新聞內所揭載的「職業婦女訪問記」，便是由我繼續着負責報導的。有人或者會以為那太瑣碎，但或者正是為需要詳細知道的人所歡迎也說不定。我不願冒昧地作人家的代言人，而我願意很忠實地寫出各業婦女們內心裏的呻吟聲！</p>
<p>記者的生活，在過慣了的人並不覺得怎樣，但如果驟然臨頭，那也往往會使你手足無措的！比方，今天你出發去訪問一個人，你將如何去開始問她？如何能夠抓住她的生活重心點來問？如何使得她能很扼要地把她要說的話儘量說出？</p>
<p>因此，每一次决定去採訪某一個人時，那便要注意到一些應行準備的事項了。在經騐上，你得預先很簡單地記錄了你想歸納的幾個問題在紙上，以免臨時遺漏。見了面後，如果對方是一個喜歡說話的人，你不妨讓她多談些。如果是一個不大說話的人，你得設法引逗她說話！否則，愛說話的說頭會常常被你打斷，不愛說話的人成了默然相對，豈不是彼此都覺得無聊乏味？而結果便會不得要領地無從着手報導了。</p>
<p>從十七年到現在，我從事於新聞事業已經七八年了。白日裏櫛風沐雨的去獵取資料，晚上還要埋頭在編輯室中整理稿件，每天總要到一兩點鐘才能入睡。但因為複雜的社會內層具備着五花八門的新奇玩意，所以我總不會感到厭倦和疲勞的。在天津剛剛住得膩了時候，大公報恰好又出上海版，使我能夠又換了一個環境。雖然僅僅在上海社會中跑了幾個月，但我覺得上海的內層至少還有好幾年可以供我的鑽硏探討。以我的個性而言，或者那時，將再自</p>

<p>動的換個環境也說不定。</p>
<p>我們婦女從業新聞界的很少，有的也多半是參加在一個報社的交易與編輯的內勤部分，担任外勤的眞是尠乎其少，我在天津在上海都還沒有碰見過一個呢！</p>
<p>在我繼續不斷的工作之中，使我了解不少婦女問題不是單純的片面的，它是整個社會問題中的一個重要的部門。我們需要全社會共同的努力，尤其需要與論界同業的深切注意，大聲疾呼，同時，我們婦女界的自覺與努力當然也極為重要。</p>
<p>「非奮鬥不足以生存！」我願以這一句話祝福婦女界的勇敢戰士！希望我們都要有堅持到底的决心！</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>七月二十日敎育日報「日日談」，公先生論「建設新的待遇制度」，他除已于隔日批評現行敎師待遇制度徒依空洞的資格「學歷」作標準的不當外，並建議一種新的待遇制度。這個問題在敎育界中早經討論了好久，可是我不知道敎育當局對於現行敎師待遇標準為什麽要「懷疾諱醫」？</p>
<p>記得五四時代，有一位呌做饒上達先生的，曾作「打破思想界四種迷信」一文，他說當時思想空氣里最大的流行病，一是迷信偶像（因為當時的人大多迷信名人），二是迷信廟宇（因為當時的人大多迷信名人所在的廟宇如哥侖比亞大學北大南高等等），三是迷信巌洞（因為當時的人對于廟宇所在的巌洞如巴黎倫敦也迷信了），四是迷信符咒（因為當時一個人只要能說幾句外國語，就會令人佩服得了不得）。該文發表到現在已逾二十年瞭，但是看看現在敎育界迷信廟宇的情形，還是像二十年前一樣，這實足令人喪氣的。</p>
<p>一切職業中，用人的標準和待遇的標準應憑服務的效果來</p>
<p>衡斷，方為合理。但單憑主觀的考査，常不免流于武斷，雖或大體不致過於相差，但總不是科學的方法。所謂「服務的效果」究竟從何處會有分野呢？這里面有三個必要的條件：</p>
<p>第一是學養。每一個人的智識的高下，能力的長短，除了先天的智慧而外，决之于各個人的學養的充足與否。培植知識技能，一從學校二從后來的進修。但學校雖為培植知識技能的重要塲所，却並不一定因進了某一等學校就能肯定的得適符該一學校相當的知能。因為在校時的努力與否各有不等成就，猶如賽跑起點縱然相同，其終點决不會相同的。觀乎事實，凡得了畢業文憑仍須經過種種考試者，其原因珆在此。但我們這里所說的學養還不是專指在學校中所經的學歷，後來的進修尤佔各個人學養的大部分。從實際情形看：從進修得來的學養如名學者王雲五，他比不學無術徒有銜頭的留學生輩，要高出何止一倍。又，同樣從一間學校出身的兩個人，出校後一個人不斷的進修，一個人則學問久疏，試思十年之後，這兩個人的學養應當相差多少？</p>
<p>我們不否認「服務的效果」决于各個人學養的優劣，但同時我們也决不承認學歷就是學養的代表，文憑就可决定服務的效能。</p>
<p>現社會，尤其是敎育界，規定服務者的待遇標準，只見學歷的輝煌，而忽略實際學養的高下，使倖進者徒知混資格的重要，却不知用功與進修尤為重要，這种風氣的養成，試問敎育行政當局，將誰尸其咎？</p>
<p>第二是經騐與能力。服務效率的大小，經騐與能力或較學養尤關緊要。許多隻研究了A＋B或垂直綫三角的學生，往往做起事來還不如學徒們的技術精嫻。同樣的，一個敎師，對於學校行政的如何設施，敎材的如何適合兒童的需要，兒童個性的如何適應，諸如此類，一個剛從師範畢業的學生與一個担任了多年敎務的老敎師，因其經騐閱歷的高下，影響於敎學效果者也將有很大的差異。假使我們蔑視了老敎師珍貴的經騐，予以一律的待遇，甚或老敎師雖有豐富的經騐，但因學歷—卽招牌或頭銜—較次，雖有優良的服務效果，而其待遇則反在初出茅廬，經騐未足者之下，揆諸事理，豈得謂平？</p>
<p>至於說到能力，其影響于服務的效果者更大。同在一個學校畢業的，同去做同一的職務，可是兩人能力相差不等，一人能計劃，能駕馭，使事務做得井井有條，成績卓著，一個因能力薄弱，作事之先既無具體計劃，辦事之後又無統馭能力，其結果自然事無不糟。所謂能力往往出于天賦，非如學養尚可賴人力補救，但我們既云服務效率，自然服務者能力的高下，應為規定待遇標準的條件之一。</p>
<p>第三是努力。凡學養，經騐，能力三條件俱臻上乘的人，若其努力不足，那麽所謂服務成績也仍不會顯現的，這有龜兔競走的故事可以給以有力的證明。我們可以肯定的說：徒有充足的學養，高强的能力，而不肯繼之以努力，卽等於沒有學養沒有經騐沒有能力的人一樣，對於服務效果還是一樣低下或平庸的。</p>
<p>打倒「空頭銜買錢」！反對「祟拜廟宇」！做事的人拿出實在的本領來！做事的人應憑努力所得效率享受適當的代價！這是我們高呼了二十年的口號　希望從此一切職業界訂出合理的薪給標準，糾正以往待遇不平的寃抑。</p>
<p>根據這個，所心我同意公先生的新的待遇制度的九十建議。其實一律以平等的最低標準俸給開始試用，在有少數機關中早見諸實行，但我不知道敎育界中各處都差不多一樣憑空頭資格買錢有什麽理由？如果說為要提高敎師的資格，那我想還不如提高學，獎勵經騐能力與努力為更合理。</p>
<p>說到待遇，本非僅包括俸給這一項，凡為服務者謀幸福的種種辦法均屬「待遇」這一意義之下的。如服務者的進修機會問題，工作時間與健康的關係問題，病老的休養問題，女服務員的生產公假問題，……這些其實都是我們直接為服務者謀幸福，間接求服務效能的進步時所必當解决的問題，然而，在現在這不合理的待遇標準之下，這些更大有尚談不至此之感呢！</p>

<h3 id="c236">上海的冷藏業 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 鄺心芹</p>
<p>中國的古書上有兩句話，呌作：「藏冰之家，不畜牛羊。」這話的意思是很有趣的！它無形中是在讚嘆冷藏之妙。卽是說，藏得起冰的人家，他們的牛羊肉宰來只消擺在冰箱中便可照常鮮美，用不着養活了。在那畜牧時代，因不會做機器冰，只能在冬天收些天然冰塊來藏着，又須有適當地方，而且只有相當富有的人家才配如此闊綽。但目前在上海，那眞是再便當沒有了。十幾斤機器冰不過賣一角來錢（天然冰已逐漸淘汰了）。為什麽如此便宜呢？這便是冷藏業發達的緣故。而且在上海更可誇口：無論那一季的新鮮菜蔬果品，在一年中間都有法買到。而肉類魚類等東西是很難吃到腐敗了的。說句笑話：靠了冷氣設備和防腐注射，最容易壞的死人屍體，在上海也會停放一兩個月而毫不變樣哩！</p>
<p>說到冷藏，便會使人想到神話裏所傳的龍王老爺的「水晶宮殿」。這一种水晶宮殿似的去處，在氷厰期的上海已可看到；但目下，是更進一步而為『看不見氷，便可凉如「冷宮」了』。那便是電機冷氣的功效。</p>
<p>上海的浦東白蓮涇等地已有着許多氷厰。去年，記者曾親身去遊覽過。那時，由一位浦東朋友作響導，他準備好了兩件親絨袍子裝在手提箱裏同我去。在氷厰外面，九十幾度的天氣使我們汗流浹背，等到一入厰門，但見氷山高聳，凉氣迎人，已把炎暑嚇退；等到走進中部，只覺置身廣寒宮裏，一陣陣冷氣逼人；那位朋友只好取出親絨袍來，彼此連忙穿上，但還覺抵擋不住，稍留片刻便走出來。據說在那裏工作的工友，人人都是預備好極厚棉襖始敢久留，否則，最少是要害一些傷寒重症的。</p>
<p>今年可算是上海的冷氣年了。凡在上海可以跑跑的人，大概誰都嚐過冷氣風味罷？電影院，戲院，舞廳，大飯店，飲氷室，在在都是拿冷氣來吸引顧客。講究些的寫字間，百貨公司也如此。但在這裏我們只能提到「吃的方面」，而專門要介紹上海的「冷藏業」。</p>
<p>綜計上海中西人士所主持的冷藏企業，計有如下的二十餘家（此中包括冷藏庫，氷厰，冷氣堆棧，經售冷藏器，冷氣機，製氷機等公司），如上海冷氣公司，上海淸潔保管公司，大華機器氷厰，上海機器氷厰，怡和冷氣堆棧，宏昌冷氣公司，洽茂冷氣公司，洽龍機器氷厰，東方機器氷厰，茂昌機器氷厰，永興冷藏庫公司，仁記氷厰，程源記氷厰，新亞製氷公司，中華氷箱公司，北極公司，田凱達，愼昌洋行，約克洋行，美最時洋行，蘇爾壽兄弟機器公司，利達公司，海京洋行等。</p>
<p>大規模的冷藏庫可藏食物如魚肉瓜菓類至十數噸之多。其內部須分三處：一是冷藏庫；一是製冰處；一是冷氣機裝置處。大規模的冷氣設備都是採用的「間接冷氣法」。以馬達發電，連繫於氣壓機，通常以液體氨為媒介，由收液箱一次注入。當壓氣機開始活動時，氨卽由澎漲門通入揮發圈，化為氣體，再由壓氣機吸引，排入凝結器內。用預備好之冷水冷却，以解除其熱力，使其復為液體。經過澎漲門，揮發又成為氣體，用以吸收外部熱力。如此循環不止，卽將主要設備之冷凝塔維持最低溫度之發揮能力，使室內熱氣儘量宣瀉於外。此機特製之冷氣箱中尚有風扇及冷水噴射於內，使冷氣源源外出。如設備完全，則兼可將冷却之水製成氷塊，除增加冷藏庫之效力外，尚可供給外界採用。冷藏庫的建築亦須特製，通常是裝置通風管由天花板風格使冷氣分佈於室內。更以製成未運出之氷塊陸續堆積於室內各隅。食物等則多半置於鐵質之架上，有類長書架者，有類輪船中白鐵者。冷氣堆棧則較簡單，因所藏非食物而大多數為用品如地毯皮貨等。至於冷藏庫的牆壁則如同一個大型氷箱，外有柏油膏的軟木板，間以油毛氈（平床位者，較考究者則多鍍鎳質，亦有用頂屋面內亦有舖此氈者），外部再塗不透氣之防水混合物數層，使之嚴密。</p>
<p>有些設備簡單的，則僅不過是有造氷處，而把造好的氷推起來圍着冷藏的東西而已。又有些地方仍舊利用天然氷（因為不喫至嘴裏不會有危險），使成本可以輕些。去冷藏食物用品等的，多半是老主顧。除了如上海淸潔保管公司登報標明價目而外，其他的地方往往是價目面議的。並且，那些販運食物蔬菓等的大商家，差不多卽是冷藏庫的老闆。</p>
<p>至於隨處可看到的酒菜館和冷飲室，它們也是必需備有冷藏箱（如氷箱，氷櫃等）。規模較大的新式的便用電氣氷箱（例如國際大飯店的廚房，要用相近十只的北極電氣氷箱），為了電氣氷箱不特可以冷藏物品，而且還可以製氷（三刻鐘可以自動製氷一次。普通常用的四尺者每次可製氷六磅），以供應用。舊式點的則用木質攔氷箱，或者也有多量天然水砌成一個小冷藏室。</p>
<p>不過，冷藏食物用品的管理人是十分重要的！大規模的冷氣工程對於調節空氣，排氣熱度方面確有顯著的效果，所以冷藏的食物可以保持鮮美。但如果管理不得法，那也會將食物反而弄得味同嚼臘的，這是牛肉類，魚類一方面最容易感到，因為零點以下的寒度也等於沸點以上的熱度，凍得過透和煮得過熟是一樣的不入味。因此，酒菜館在大暑天時的生意經，常要靠了冷藏得法，才會有人光顧的。</p>
<p>最近上海平空添了不少伙食公司，它們申明可為需要各種新鮮肉類魚類菜蔬菓品者服務，並可代配肴饌用料，從幾角錢至數十元錢，小大由之，並可於最短時間內用汽車送到。講究的伙食公司，自己所預備的車子裏便有小型完備的冷藏設備，因為它的生意是可以東至浦東，南至閔行，北至寳山，西至眞如的。若沒有這種活動冷藏庫，所則送食物老早就腐壞了。</p>
<p>目前，上海的中等以上人家大多也很注重冷藏，而有電氣氷箱，置氷箱等之設備。如此冷來冷去，有福的上海人是很少會吃到腐敗了的食物的。</p>

<h3 id="c237">英國首相鮑爾温 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 謨</p>
<p>在英國的政治家中，最出名的恐怕要算現任首相鮑爾溫吧。他是在英國舞台上最活動而活動時間又最長的人，他是保守黨現在的首領，曾作過三次內閣首相—總理；你若問英國人：貴國最有名的人物是誰，那他們必然要說是首相鮑爾溫。</p>
<p>鮑爾溫是一位典型的英國紳士，他懂得什麽呌做禮貌，他常常現出愉快的臉，表示出溫和淡泊的神情，但他却能說會辯，機警果斷，因之他最為老大英國的紳士和資本家所歡迎；而他自己也最能體貼這些人的意志，他明白他要代表這些人說話才能在現狀下的英國上台。</p>
<p>史坦萊·鮑爾溫，一八六七年八月三日生於英國瓦賽斯達卡的蒲德萊。出身豪富之家，因之他能進大學受高等敎育，具有了一般社會活動和政治活動的知能。</p>
<p>從學校出來後，鮑爾溫曾在他父親所經營的鮑爾溫公司裏服務。但他却很有興趣於政治活動，這樣，到了一九〇八年，他便在本鄉被選為下議院議員了。一九二一年他更被任為商務局總裁，並成為了內閣閣員之一。這時，他早已參加保守黨，他的一切努力當然也都是站在保守黨立塲的。及至一九二二年十月，他竟以一篇演說將勞合·喬治世聯合內閣推倒了，接着便是保守黨黨魁波納·羅出任首相，同時鮑爾溫也就一躍而作了財政部長。第二年，羅氏因病引退，於是鮑爾溫更拜受大命，組織內閣，榮膺首相的重任。這時，也有國際上乃至在英國國內的聲名還不很大，所以他的受命組閣頗引起人們的驚異；有些英國人甚至還根本不知道他是什麽樣的人。據說那時他所出身的格姆布里茲大學曾召開懇親會，鮑爾溫也去參加，在會中遇見了科學者湯姆生，是他同學多年的級友。於是，便發生了這樣一個有趣的問答：</p>
<p>「你是秀面熟的，請敎尊姓大名！」湯姆生問。</p>
<p>「我是史坦萊·鮑爾</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>溫。」鮑爾溫說。</p>
<p>「啊！是的，我想起來了！但是，鮑爾溫閣下，你現刻在做什麽事情？」</p>
<p>鮑爾溫不禁微笑着答道：「我是總理大臣！」</p>
<p>這一下科學者湯姆生才驚惶起來，他睜着眼睛審視他對面的總理大臣，好像對他的耳朶和眼睛都有點不相信似的。</p>
<p>不過，這第一次的鮑爾溫保守黨內閣，未到一年就吿崩潰；接着是在一九二四年一月，英國最初的工黨內閣由麥唐納組成了。但在這年十月英國總選舉中，保守黨又大敗工黨，在下院獲得了過半數的議席，於是鮑爾溫又第二次受命組閣。這時他所做的最重要的事，第一是建設新加坡軍港，以保護英帝國在東方的權利；第二是對蘇絕交；第三是訂立羅加洛條約，企圖集合歐洲列強對付蘇聯。這些事情當然是獲得英國一般紳士之喝采了的。因之他的內閣得到了一時的穩固。可是，二年以後，不幸英國發生了空前的煤鑛工人大罷工，使保守黨內閣幾乎馬上崩潰，鮑爾溫這時除呌「神啊，給與和平啊，」之外，可說是束手無策；及至一九二九年，總選舉結果，保守黨卽為工黨所敗，鮑爾溫的第二次內閣也就在六　實行總辭職了。</p>
<p>一九三一年，英國金本位崩潰，麥唐納的工黨內閣瀕於危機，向英皇提出辭呈；這時老奸巨滑的鮑爾溫知道了形勢的嚴重，內閣處　的困難，便决定援助麥唐納，組織了所胃舉國一致的國民內閣，鮑爾溫任樞密大臣。但是，這個所謂舉國一致的國民內閣，實際是在保守黨鮑爾溫支配之下的，麥唐納不過是他的傀儡罷了，因之當時曾有人說國民內閣是「二個首相的內閣」。</p>
<p>本來，在一九三一年十月總選舉後，保守黨勢力膨脹，鮑爾溫卽可出而組閣，但久經世故的他却不馬上出馬，他打定主意讓麥唐納繼續幹下去，及至一九三五年麥唐納被他玩弄得聲名掃地時，他才出來受命組閣，担任首相。這便是鮑爾溫的第三次上台。</p>
<p>這次以鮑爾溫為首相的內閣，名義上還是呌做國民內閣，但實際上却全為保守黨所支配的。起初內閣陣營是：西門任首相，霍爾任外相，艾登任不管部閣員；但當意阿戰爭發生時，霍爾因素主親意，不主對意實行制裁，卽行辭去外相，代之的是艾登。及至對意實施制裁後，因為英國不顧保證希特勒對世界和平的威脅行動，致使法國也不能積極對意，而慕索里尼在東菲的侵略行動又是有增無已，使英國的威信和國聯的命運都遭到了最嚴重的嘗試，在這中間，鮑爾溫內閣曾為動搖，幾乎崩潰。後來意大利宣布BING呑阿比西尼亞，國聯制裁失去了積極作用，而英國一部份紳士又根本反對制裁，因之鮑爾溫又見風駛舵，主張取消制裁，撤退地中海艦隊，重請親意的霍爾入閣，最近更取消地中海沿岸的互助公約，以取好於慕索里尼。</p>
<p>不過，在此世界多事之秋，鮑爾溫的政治壽命究產晚能維持到幾時，實是很難說的。不說別的，連他的兒子阿里佛都反對過他的政治傾向，這便可以看出他在英國的信用已墮落到了什麽程度了。</p>

<h3 id="c238">家庭的起源 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 光祿</p>
<p>家庭制度，若是只要指示一定羣集之性生殖的相繼的血緣關係，那麽它是可以沿用得很古的。因為就在那僅僅二三十人構成的流蕩羣的最原始的人類中，我們亦可以視為它是最原始的一定親系所產的。這很明白，異族的通婚的事情，在人類形成很久以後尚被禁止，老死不相往來甚至互相仇殺，是古代的野蠻部落間很流行的風俗。所以在最原始的一定羣集的人類，他們都只是出於自己的親系，成為同一血緣之所產，大槪是可以確定的。但是如果把家族關係不單單當作血緣關係解釋，而當作一種兩性間之個人的性結合形式與制度看，甚至當作在大的社會中之依於性的關係而構成小型的個別的組織那種制度看，那麽家庭制度中雖也要包含性的關係，血統關係，甚至由它自己也出生於這些關係而成為它之成立的部分理由，然而却不能簡單地只看做是自然的血緣關係，把它拿來和後者完全混同起看。</p>
<p>性的生活，在人類的最初階段上看，它只是自然地行着雜交，一切女子都是一切男子的妻，一切男子也都是一切女子的夫。不但兄弟姊妹間大家都互為夫妻，而且就在親子間也一樣普遍的，我們不但可以從古代的只知有母而不知有父的風俗中得着證明，認識出那時母與一切男子都常發生性的關係，因而不能辨明兒子是誰的，只有生他育他的母親可以知道，而且明克洛夫曾舉出白令海峽的加惟提人，阿拉斯加的卡打克人，北美內地的廷涅人，利托拿亦曾舉出智利的庫庫人，印度支那的加勒皮人，卡梭人等以為證明。旣然在人類的原始的社會形態中，性的生活是無規律和限制的，那麽在　的關係上只是本於自然的需要，並沒有一種習慣的規律作為規定，不能被稱為甚麽人為的制度，因而依於性的限制和其個別的狹隘的血緣系統而成立的家庭制度，一般的是不存在的。如果要把那時的性的關係稱為一種制度，那麽至多只能稱為亂婚制，這制度至多只是自然的本能的要求而自然存在的，絕不含有人為的規定的意義。</p>
<p>在另一方面，原始的人類之社會的經濟生活，完全是共有的生活形態。他們至多只在某些生產的習用慣了的工具上，得為個人所保留，甚至就是這些東西在死後也仍然歸於團體所有。因為如此，所以在生產勞動上是共同的，而生產的收獲物亦共同分配於全體成員。個人或在共同團體中的更小的單一的羣體，都不能從大的社會中分化出來，因為沒有由他和它們個別地私有任何財富的現象存在。由於這種共有的社會經濟制度的結果，那根據於兩情的結合與依其血統而構成一種小的特別的團集，並在大的社會中獨立地營它的經濟生活，卽只提供勞力於自己的小集團，並由這小集團私有其勞動工具和一切收獲，根本是不可能的。因此，這種能夠獨立地營自己的一切生活的小集團，就不存在也不能存在了。這就是說，在原始的共同社會中，在經濟的關係上，是不能允許這種自成獨立的小的個別的私有單位存在的，那樣的意義的家庭並不能說已出現於原始的共同社會中。</p>
<p>從上述的理由看來，所谓家庭制度，卽如果根據於性的血緣之小的體系的獨立組織，根據經濟的小的獨立單位之私生活的組織說的家庭制度的一般的是不能很早就存在的。因那時性的關係是不固定的，而且就是子女在成人時也是屬於共同團體的成員，並不是單個家庭的成員。在經濟方面也因為是共同的，所以沒有從公共的經濟生活中分化出來另成單獨的經濟體系的可能。因為如此，所以所謂家庭制度，在原始的社會裏，卽使要說有它的根源的話，至多我們也只能說它所根據的性的結合與血緣的結合之根本因素，是存在於那時的社會裏的。然而家庭制度是有能動性的，其變化亦隨社會經濟關係的變化而變化，所以我們如果刮剝了它的經濟關係的基因，而單從性的關係與血緣關係去談家庭制度的起源，那將會甚麽也不能說明的。</p>
<p>但是，却有許多學者，只簡單地根據性的結合來說明家族之起源，認為絕對無規律的性交在人類史上根本不存在，人類是自來只有一夫多妻或一妻多夫的，而一夫一妻則是至上的道德。因此主張由於固定的性的結合，家庭是早已存在的人類生活形態，家庭制度是從人類的出現起而自然存在的東西。不但如此，他們還在動物中去尋覓根據，認為許多鳥類是忠於一夫一妻制的，在獮猴類和類人猿也是一夫一妻或一夫多妻的，就在動物間那種絕對無規律的性交也是屬於低的階段的，所以這家庭制度的因素，似乎是更早的在動物中已由性的結合之限制而成立了。自然，在烏類中也確有一夫一妻的事實，然而這只是簡單的由於生理的關係在孵卵間受不到羣的扶助之利益的緣故。在獮猴和類人猿中，不但那種一夫一妻或一夫多妻的事實並未得着無矛盾的證明，而且在猿猴類是羣的生活比較發達了的動物，保護幼猿已經不是只屬於牠的親的責任，而是牠們的羣的</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation in Western Guangdong Becomes More Precarious: A Regiment of the Guangxi Army Marches into Xinyi; Yu Orders Chen's Troops to Intercept from Luoding; Chen Hanguang's Unit Deploys for Defense in Yangjiang and Yangchun <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Magistrate of Xinyi County telegraphs the Provincial Government reporting that the 1st Regiment of Gui Army under Su Zuxin marched into Xinyi from Luchuan on the 31st; two more regiments are expected to follow. Yu Hanmou has ordered Chen Zhang's division from Zhaoqing to intercept them at Luoding, and has dispatched Chen Hanguang's troops to Kaiyang, Yangjiang, and Yangchun. Passenger buses on all roads in the Southern Route have been suspended and are used exclusively for military transport. (Special dispatch, 1st) Deng Longguang's division has been ordered by Yu Hanmou to move east towards Sanshui and Zhaoqing in the West River area. (Special dispatch, 1st) Military transport keeps the Guangdong roads busy; passenger buses to Yingde and Yuantan were suspended for a day. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Southwest Airlines suspended flights to Wuzhou and Yongzhou on the 1st. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Yu Hanmou, the newly appointed Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong Province, is currently expediting the westward deployment of troops to defend against the Guangxi army's intrusion. According to news from various Chinese newspapers, the establishment of an independent military government in Guangxi Province has not yet been realized, but it is difficult to avoid. Besides Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Li Jishen, other individuals who have accepted appointments from the new government include Chen Mingshu, Liu Luyin, and Huang Jilong, all of whom will reportedly serve as cabinet members. (Reuter's dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to telegrams received by the Guangdong authorities, 4,000 Guangxi militiamen moving eastward from Nanning suddenly broke through the provincial border at Heng County, occupying Lingshan County in Guangdong Province, and are advancing towards Hepu and Beihai. Furthermore, a large force of regular Guangxi troops and militiamen from Yulin and Luchuan are also moving south into Guangdong Province. These Guangxi troops, shortening their battle lines in the northern and eastern provincial borders, intend to seize the coastline of the southern route of Guangdong, west of the Leizhou Peninsula. Yu Hanmou, recognizing the gravity of the situation, rushed a contingent of Guangdong troops to the Leizhou Peninsula this morning. (Allied Press dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Fourth Army has resolved to reorganize into ten divisions, each division consisting of two brigades, and each brigade consisting of three regiments. No redundant units will be established. The plan has been submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Hanguang's unit has decided to be reorganized into the 10th Division, under the command of two brigades. Deng Zhicai will be the commander of the 19th Brigade, and Li Shuzong will be the commander of the 20th Brigade. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yu Hanmou appointed Chen Hanguang as the commander of the 10th Division, Li Shuzong as the commander of the 20th Brigade of the division, and Li Gang as the successor to the Gendarmerie Commander on the 1st. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Hanguang returned from Jiangmen to the province on the 1st to meet with Yu Hanmou. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The newly appointed Gendarmerie Commander Wu Gang took office at 9:00 AM on the 1st. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Military Academy has been renamed as a Central Branch School, directly under the Central Government. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) According to a telegram from Wuzhou, Huang Xuchu has reportedly secretly left Yongzhou for Hong Kong. The position of Provincial Chairman he left behind is temporarily assumed by Li Jishen. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Mai Huanzhang has left Guangxi and arrived in Hong Kong by ship. He is unusually indignant about the rebellious actions of Li and Bai. Huang Xuchu is also rumored to be coming along. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhang Renmin opposed the mutiny of Li and Bai and left Guangxi in disappointment after failing to persuade them. He arrived in Hong Kong on the night of the 31st, maintaining a passive attitude. When asked about the recent situation in Guangxi, Zhang said that Li and Bai are willing to gamble the lives and property of the people of Guangxi on a single throw of the dice, and will surely be abandoned by the people of Guangxi, with failure being inevitable. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Military conferences have been held in Yongning for several days, with many generals opposing the authorities' measures. After the meetings, many mid- and lower-ranking officers were suddenly detained, and now everyone is in danger, and no one dares to advocate for peace. Militias in various parts of Guangxi are flocking to the mountains to avoid conscription, while others have expressed opposition to the civil war and clashed with the military. Currently, there is a psychological divide between the military and the people of Guangxi, and the situation is extremely chaotic. Li and Bai consider this a major hidden danger and have decided to fundamentally resolve any militia groups that are not aligned with them. According to those who fled to the province from Lingshan, the advance troops of Guangxi's Wang Zanbin arrived on the border of Lingshan on the 30th. Li and Bai have sent personnel to the southern route to recruit local militia bandits. The people in the counties along the southern route are in a state of panic. Major commercial ports in Beihai have suspended trade. People's organizations in various counties have telegraphed General Commander Yu, requesting the dispatch of large forces to garrison the area. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to people from Guangxi, the standing army in Guangxi is only about 50,000 men, and its air force is even weaker. What Li and Bai are relying on to resist the Central Government are the militia forces of over 100,000, but the militia has firmly expressed its opposition to civil war and is only responsible for defending the local area. Therefore, the Guangxi army's invasion of Guangdong and Hunan seems to be a means of bluffing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e12">The North China Floods and the Water Conservancy Problem <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>In the past five years, we have witnessed two widespread floods and one widespread drought across the country. "We talk about water management every day, but floods cannot be prevented. We talk about water conservancy every day, but droughts cannot be avoided." Is this a blessing for the country? From the rise and fall of water conservancy, from the quality of water conservancy organizations, we can not only get a glimpse of the prosperity and decline of agriculture in a country, but also of the rise and fall of the country's fortune. Shanzi Guo Chen saw that the "ponds were not embanked" in the state of Chen, agricultural affairs were not cultivated, and the people were frivolous, and knew that Chen was about to perish. Three years ago, Professor Mai Lei, a member of the Paris International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, wrote to Mr. Cai Jiemin, President of the Central Research Institute of our country, also said, "...Before a culture is destroyed, there are other signs of decline. Mankind's ability to control the environment is gradually declining. Fields are barren. The construction of roads and canals is dilapidated. Disasters and floods are prevalent. And the authorities have no ability to resist." Although this is not directed at our country, there are many shocking facts in our country that make us want to savor the meaning of this statement again and again. For example, last year we expanded the disaster area due to the inability to control the floods. The number of victims in Hunan and Hubei provinces reached more than seven million. The number of victims in Shandong Province reached more than five million. This year, due to the severe spring famine after the disaster, eating tree bark and grass roots is often heard. This summer, the Yangtze River basin is expected to have a bumper harvest in the autumn due to the uniform adjustment of water levels, such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. However, floods in the Yellow River basin are still frequently reported. There are floods in the Zhang River. There are floods in the Chao River and the Bai River. There are floods in the Yongding River. Only its area is slightly smaller than last year.</p>
<p>In terms of weather and geographical advantages, the defense against floods in North China is relatively difficult. First, because the rainfall in North China is unevenly distributed. The climate is dry in spring, winter, and autumn, with very little rainfall. There is a lot of rainfall in summer. Therefore, when summer comes, it is easy to become flooded. Second, North China is a loess layer. Loess lacks viscosity and is very easy to wash away. And the rivers in North China carry a lot of mud and sand. Therefore, the riverbeds are all higher than the banks on both sides of the river. When a heavy rain comes suddenly, the river often cannot hold it, and it is easy to cause floods. Floods are frequently seen in North China. This is also one of the important reasons.</p>
<p>Although this natural condition is not easy to overcome for a while, it is not absolutely uncontrollable. Of course, this cannot be achieved overnight. We should have the greatest effort. A sound water conservancy organization. An entire water conservancy plan. Although we cannot achieve the ability to control nature in a short period of time, we can at least avoid the disasters caused by poor planning. Past facts tell us. The occurrence of floods is often 30% due to weather and 70% due to human affairs. Such as the improper handling of water conservancy and water administration. Such as the lack of unity of water conservancy powers. Such as the shortage of water conservancy funds. All of which are enough to create unprecedented disaster areas. Remembering the past is a guide for the future. If we want to prevent floods. We should first pay attention to the water conservancy institutions. Because with a sound water conservancy institution. We can have the power to be controlled by nature. And achieve the purpose of preventing floods. This is a necessary and first problem that must be solved.</p>

<p>— Our reporter Hu Zhongshi Hu Yizang</p>
<p>(7) Two Newspaper Kingdoms</p>
<p>After visiting the classical, historical city of Osaka, we are going to the two modern newspaper kingdoms of Japan. This exaggerated name is given by some Japanese people to the "Osaka Asahi" and the "Osaka Mainichi." In terms of capital strength and scale, these two newspaper offices can indeed overwhelm other newspaper offices in the country and influence the thinking of most Japanese people. The former controls the Tokyo Nichinichi, and has established branches and bureaus of considerable size in other major cities throughout the country. Recently, I heard that local newspapers with greater vigor in various parts of Japan are gradually tending to join these two major news systems. For example, the Shin Aichi Shimbun for Asahi, and the Nagoya Shimbun for Mainichi are examples. The development of modern Japanese capitalism has made the industry in the country tend to collectivize. Not only is the newspaper industry like this. Everyone knows that Japan's two largest financial groups, Mitsui and Mitsubishi, not only occupy a great deal of labor in important parts of the national industry and commerce, but also the large department stores and theaters in the cities often come from the systems of these two major financial groups. Some people say that Osaka Asahi represents the organ of public opinion of the Mitsui system, and Osaka Mainichi represents the writings of three. Judging from the attitude of the two newspapers, this statement may be somewhat credible.</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun in Nakanoshima and the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun in Dojima face each other across the bridge. We visited both newspaper offices the night before. Because their main working hours are in the afternoon and not at night, the staff members of the two newspapers invited us to formally visit at 3:00 PM the next day. We left Osaka Castle, it was still early, and Consul Ren invited us to first go to the Asahi Hall, which the Osaka Asahi Shimbun boasts as the palace of art, to have some refreshments. The Asahi Hall is a dark black, straight-line six-story building (excluding the basement) standing next to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun's white, horizontal-line ten-story building, making the magnificence of modern architecture even more evident. The performance venue on the fourth floor and above can accommodate 1,700 spectators. It usually screens movies or holds lectures, dances, dramas, Noh, and the like. The exhibition venue on the third floor often hosts various art exhibitions. The second floor is an office and tea shop, and the inner part of the first floor communicates with the newspaper office, serving as the printing and distribution venue for the Asahi Shimbun, while the surface part operates a department store. From there, we went upstairs, and in the large tea room filled with people, we and Consul Ren sat around a small glass-faced round table and drank some coffee and black tea. Then it was almost 3:00 PM. We said goodbye to Consul Ren and walked into the main building of the Asahi Shimbun office that we wanted to visit.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter the door, you will see the large office hall of the business bureau. Behind a long row of black artificial stone counters sat dozens of busy staff members. Among them, five or six young and energetic women were at the near end, serving as "receptionists." After they received any manuscripts or letters sent from outside, they first registered them on a form, and then put the receipts in a leather round tube in a vacuum conveying machine, and sent them to the upper part of the building by mechanical action. Our visiting card was also sent to the editorial bureau using the same procedure. Then a student-dressed boy came and guided us upstairs.</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian government is investigating the Italian aircraft that crashed in Algeria on Thursday, which was reportedly one of six aircraft supplied to the rebels in Spanish Morocco. According to official statements here, the Italian government has not supplied aircraft or munitions to the warring parties in Spain.

<p>(Paris) The supply of Italian aircraft to the Spanish rebels continues to cause great consternation internationally.

Furthermore, Captain Ciliberti, a detained Italian aviation officer, stated that when he landed, he thought he was in Spanish territory, and that this trip was dispatched by a private Italian manufacturer to supply munitions to the Spanish rebels. Regarding this matter, General Tran, the French government's investigator and former Minister of Aviation, is continuing his investigation.

<p>(Paris) According to sources in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, France will initiate a conference with Britain, France, Italy, and Germany to discuss strict neutrality on the Spanish civil war. However, other sources say that France intends to abandon this international conference for two reasons: first, Britain is unwilling to get involved in the Spanish situation; second, France itself is unwilling to be bound by any constraints that would be seen as violating its neutrality policy. (31st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Spanish civil war continues unabated. As of last night, there was no news of a decisive battle between government forces and rebel forces. At this time, any aid given by any country to the government in Madrid or to rebel leader General Franco would inevitably lead to further repercussions stemming from the civil war. Therefore, the capitals of Europe are extremely uneasy. As for France, Foreign Minister Delbos yesterday reiterated in the Chamber of Deputies that he had not supplied munitions to the Spanish government, and subsequently won a vote of confidence from the Chamber. At the same time, in order to ascertain the truth about the Italian aircraft incident, the government has dispatched former Aviation Minister General Tran to Oran, French Algeria, North Africa, to conduct an investigation. According to this reporter's sources, Tran has arrived in Oujda, which is not far from the mouth of the Moulouya River, where the Italian aircraft crashed. The Italian Consul General in Casablanca, French Morocco, has also arrived there. As for the six Italian aviation personnel aboard the crashed Italian aircraft, they were detained by the local French authorities. After interrogation, they initially claimed to be industrialists or artists, giving inconsistent statements. They then admitted that they were reserve officers of the Italian Air Force, dispatched by an Italian factory to fly aircraft to Spanish Morocco. According to eyewitnesses, when the second Italian aircraft was forced to land at the Sebdou airfield, a Spanish aircraft flew to the scene and dropped a package to the Italian aircrew. The package contained several Spanish Foreign Legion uniforms and a document written in Italian, instructing them to wear these uniforms in order to impersonate officers of the Spanish Foreign Legion. Furthermore, according to news from Melilla in Spanish Morocco, a total of twenty-one Italian aircraft have flown to Spanish Morocco. All were Savoia aircraft, and eighteen have safely reached their destination. (1st Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Rumors that the French government is advocating for a conference of Mediterranean countries to discuss the Spanish situation have been met with approval from political figures. However, they say that a full conference would only exacerbate existing political tensions between countries and create unnecessary complications. Negotiations through diplomatic channels would be better, and negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy are especially necessary. Furthermore, the Italian aircraft incident is "extremely serious." It is hoped that the Italian government has already decided to investigate the case, and that the situation will then become more moderate. Regarding the issue of British munitions being shipped to Spain, these political figures have summarized the government's view, stating that Britain advocates absolutely prohibiting the export of all munitions destined for Spanish territory, but that commercial aircraft and automobiles are free to export without restriction. Four British Airways aircraft that recently arrived in Bordeaux, France, were detained by the authorities of the Charente-Maritime department and have not yet been released. In fact, these aircraft are commercial aircraft that have been used by three airlines in succession. These are the facts, and they should be released so that they can fly to Lisbon, Portugal. The British government is now demanding that the French government release the aircraft immediately if it cannot prove that the aircraft are for military use. (31st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tangier – The Third Brigade of the Foreign Legion belonging to the Spanish Moroccan rebels arrived in Tetuan Port today. Several foreign seaplanes have recently arrived in the port. The soldiers of the brigade will board these aircraft to return to the country to fight. According to a reporter for the French newspaper "Paris Midi," he saw three aircraft in Tetuan Port with the Nazi swastika emblazoned on their wings. Furthermore, a Spanish government aircraft flew over Tangier Bay today at a low altitude before leaving after a while. As for the country's warships that have been stationed in the port since the 18th of this month, they left the port last night along with several submarines, which has eased the tense situation here. At the same time, the British cruiser "Galatea" arrived in the port this morning with Vice Admiral Somerville on board. In addition, the Fortress Commander of Gibraltar, in view of the frequent clashes between Spanish rebel seaplanes and government submarines in the Strait of Gibraltar, has used radio to warn ships entering and exiting the strait to be cautious and take precautions.

<h3 id="e22">Grand Debate in French Chamber of Deputies on Policy Towards Spain; Foreign Minister Declares Strict Neutrality; Chamber of Deputies Expresses Confidence in Government <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies held an important meeting this afternoon to discuss foreign policy. The Chamber was packed, and the public gallery was also overcrowded. Former Minister of Finance Le Rouz of the right-wing party spoke first, arguing that the government must greatly strengthen its military, because a country without sufficient military strength, even if it has peaceful aspirations, cannot force others to follow. However, military equipment can be divided into two categories: one that is aggressive and one that is used to protect peace, and this distinction must be made. Communist Deputy Berry spoke next, saying that countries that love peace must form a common front to resist aggressive countries. Germany has repeatedly engaged in unilateral behavior over the past year, and France must form a strong front to counter this and prevent such unilateral behavior from happening again, and to prevent Germany from gradually increasing its position. If France truly has this aspiration, then it will not be difficult for other peace-loving nations to unite and cooperate with it. He also said, "British Prime Minister Baldwin once said, 'The borders of Britain are not the sheer cliffs of the Strait of Dover, but the banks of the Rhine River.' This is a wise saying. However, Britain should not only take the Rhine as its border, but should sometimes extend it as far as Japan, because British subjects are sometimes abused by Japanese police." Left-wing Deputy Peschelet advocated making a surprising arms reduction proposal to Germany, to see if Hitler is sincere. Only by seeing whether he can implement this proposal can we know whether he is sincere. He also said that if disarmament cannot be implemented, then collective security is just empty talk. Right-wing leader Maran advocated that the guarantee measures for the French-Belgian border stipulated in the future Locarno Treaty should have the same effect as those contained in the original treaty. Foreign Minister Delbos then delivered a speech, saying that Britain, France, and Belgium love peace and do not want to engage in a crusade-style action to maintain peace. This has been clearly demonstrated by the results of the London talks. As for the policy pursued by France, its goal is to avoid dividing Europe into two opposing blocs. "Any crusade-style action, whether it is to support democracy, fascism, Bolshevism, or to oppose these ideologies, is not what France wants to hear. We have always avoided interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Even if we have propaganda campaigns, we never cross national borders." Delbos then explained France's concept of regional pacts and the purpose of the future five-nation conference, saying that the first task of this conference should be to conclude a new Locarno Treaty to replace the original one, and then to seek a solution to the overall situation in Europe. Britain, France, and Belgium do not want to impose this will on others, nor do they intend to establish a system in which the five powers preside over the overall situation. Future negotiations must complete a practical and constructive work, and should not only be a victory for one country or another. Italy and Germany have now been invited to participate in the conference, which we are pleased to see, because it is neither in France's interest for Germany to remain outside the European group for a long time, nor is it to Germany's benefit for France to ignore the affairs of the European group. If the European situation is to be resolved comprehensively, it must be done with the participation of all countries concerned. This is clearly evident." Delbos then mentioned the Montreux Conference, saying that the establishment of the new Straits Convention is a matter of great celebration. Regarding the situation in Spain, he said, "The current government in Spain is a legitimate government, and no one can deny it. As far as France is concerned, the current government in Spain is a friendly government. Moreover, France and Spain are geographically adjacent, and their relationship is like teeth and lips. The friendship of Spain is extremely valuable to France, and there is good reason for this. The outside world accuses the French government of supplying munitions to Spain, but this is absolutely inaccurate. Although we can sell munitions to Spain through normal procedures, we do not want to give other countries an excuse to interfere. Therefore, we have never taken this step." Regarding the Italian aircraft incident, Delbos only said that an investigation has been launched and did not mention anything else. He also said that France deeply desires the end of the arms race, and this desire can be seen in the nationalization of all munitions factories. "France advocates simultaneous reduction and monitoring of land, sea, and air forces, and there is a need to reduce air forces. This position has already been made clear to the world." (31st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the Chamber of Deputies discussed the government's foreign policy yesterday, Foreign Minister Delbos delivered a speech declaring that France would maintain neutrality in the Spanish civil war. After discussion, the Chamber finally passed a motion with 359 votes to 200, expressing confidence in the government's current foreign policy. The text of the motion reads, "The Chamber of Deputies trusts that the government will not neglect its duty to strive to maintain world peace and French security." (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a cabinet meeting this morning, which ended at 1:00 PM. It was decided that Minister of the Interior Salengro would issue a circular to government offices in the southern provinces, explaining that the French government is strictly neutral in the Spanish unrest, which is the same attitude it has adopted towards unrest in any country. Any national or foreign person who volunteers to go to Spain to serve in the government forces or the rebel forces, or who comes to France from Spain, only needs to hold a valid passport and not carry weapons, and the government cannot prevent them. Government offices in the provinces must understand this and comply with the order. Minister of Commerce Bastid has decided that all payments owed by French people to Spanish people will be temporarily suspended. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>The Two Armies in Northern Spain Prepare for a Decisive Battle; The Rebels Plan to Seize a Seaport</p>
<p>Madrid – A decisive battle between government forces and rebel forces is about to break out in northern Spain. Government forces are planning to recapture Orson. The rebels in Zaragoza have mobilized all men in the area to resist the advancing government forces from Catalonia. Government aircraft are currently bombing the area every day, but because the aircraft are not equipped with bomb racks, the pilots have to extend their arms out of the aircraft to drop the bombs, which is quite inconvenient. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid – Special dispatch from our reporter with the army on the northern front: A military officer in the General Staff of the government forces recently said that the government forces have concentrated heavy forces in the Guadarrama Mountains to prepare for a decisive battle with the rebel forces.

<p>Madrid – Premier Quirol recently told our reporter that the government forces now have the upper hand everywhere. The food in the capital is being supplied steadily from Valencia, which is of great help. Although the port of Huelva in the south is in the hands of the rebels, after the government fleet bombed it yesterday, the warships have entered the port. In addition, aircraft belonging to the government forces flew to Palma, Majorca, Zaragoza, Huesca, Calatayud (southwest of Zaragoza), Cordoba, and Oviedo to carry out bombing raids. A rebel aircraft was forced to land on the Somma Sierra front north of the capital. Furthermore, the police department recently arrested two key members of the rebel party, one being former Ambassador to Brazil de Mazzo, and the other being Cotonieu, the half-brother of former monarchist cabinet member Serva.

<p>Barcelona – The Catalan Autonomous Government has resigned en masse. The Chairman of the Provincial Council, Casanovas, will form a new government, acting as chairman himself, appointing Socialist Verdielago Mora, Communist Antrelles, Left Republican Lorelai, and Air Force Commander Lieutenant Colonel Santino. Former Chairman Companys told the press that the resignation of the Provincial Government was to recruit members of various parties to strengthen the foundation of the Provincial Government, and there was no other reason. (32nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Barcelona – After the resignation of the Catalan Autonomous Government, a new government was quickly formed. Its nature is even more left-leaning than the Companys government, but it does not belong to the Marxist faction. The position of chairman is held by Casanovas, the chairman of the Provincial Council. Esbana serves as the Minister of the Interior, Air Force Commander Lieutenant Colonel Sandino serves as the Minister of National Defense, Socialist Ruiz serves as the Minister of Public Food, and Socialist Verdiera serves as the Minister of Transportation. All the special powers of the Chairman of the Provincial Government are still held by former Chairman Companys, but the executive power is entrusted to Casanovas. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Italian government has accepted the invitation to participate in the upcoming five-power conference in principle. The Information Bureau recently issued a communiqué stating that Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with French Ambassador Chambrun and the British and Belgian Chargés d'affaires this afternoon, informing them that "once the date for the five-power conference is decided, Italy is prepared to participate. However, before the conference begins, opinions should be exchanged through diplomatic channels on the various issues to be discussed in order to prepare." Ciano also notified German Ambassador Hassel of the above decision. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) There is talk of increasing the German troops stationed in the Rhineland. According to an official announcement, the troops will be gradually increased because the promise made by Führer Hitler not to send more troops to the Rhineland within four months expires at midnight today. Therefore, this troop increase is being taken. Although there are no preparations for any hasty actions at the end of this week, the troop increase will depend on the needs of the time and the extent permitted by the environment. Furthermore, there is no intention of moving the garrison locations closer to the French border. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Since German troops entered the Rhineland region on March 7th of this year (the date of the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty), there have been rumors that the number of troops stationed there has recently increased. These rumors have recently been denied by semi-official sources. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures have expressed satisfaction that both Italy and Germany have agreed to participate in the five-power conference, believing that the conference could take place in September or October of this year. The countries concerned will begin negotiations through diplomatic channels on the 10th of this month to prepare for the conference. However, it is possible that both Germany and Italy may raise conditions for accepting the issues during the diplomatic negotiations. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) All newspapers have expressed joy that both Germany and Italy have accepted the invitation to participate in the five-power conference. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that since Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, Britain and France have not dared to express optimism about the future situation. This news is enough to generate a sense of optimism. We have not heard good news about the European situation for a long time. This time, let us look at the surface of the facts without delving into their meaning, so as to avoid disappointment. The "Morning Post" reported that "the decision of Germany and Italy to accept the invitation to participate in the five-power conference is enough to prevent the closure of the door to resolving the European situation. This is also the first time that Italy has agreed to attend an international conference since the implementation of sanctions. All of this is satisfactory. Furthermore, the three signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty have forgiven Germany's unilateral reoccupation of the Rhineland region, thereby contributing to the solution of European problems. Germany should now behave well." (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>Quebec City, Canada. U.S. President Roosevelt arrived here today and addressed those who welcomed him in English and French, citing the nearly 100 years of peaceful coexistence between the U.S. and Canada and the fact that their 3,000-mile border is completely unfortified as a model for countries around the world that brandish military power. Canadian Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir and Prime Minister Mackenzie King also delivered welcoming speeches with similar sentiments. President Roosevelt also stated that there is an even more valuable monument: the battlefield here in the past has now been transformed into an area where people of English and French descent live in peace and prosperity. The recent reciprocal trade agreement signed between the U.S. and Canada is also clear evidence of the two countries' peoples implementing a good neighbor policy. President Roosevelt also expressed his condolences for the late King George V of England, and then thanked the local Administrator Godbout and Mayor Grégoire in French for their welcome. When the President's party arrived, the local situation was very enthusiastic, with the entire city decorated and American flags flying from houses and cars. The American flag was also prominently displayed at the Governor General's residence. When the President got out of the car, a 21-gun salute was fired to show respect, and an honor guard composed of infantry and mounted police was lined up to welcome him. The Governor General then hosted a banquet at the residence. After the banquet, the party toured the city and is scheduled to return to the United States via Montreal at 6:00 p.m. tonight.

<p>(London) An Anglo-Russian naval agreement has been reached in principle. Although Soviet Russia no longer insists on its original demands, informed sources claim that the agreement allows Soviet Russia to build two battleships and seven first-class cruisers, thereby allowing the country's navy to expand greatly. This may not be recognized by Germany. If so, all efforts to limit naval power will be in vain. British naval figures now believe that most of the new ships to be built by Soviet Russia will belong to the Far East Fleet, so the situation in the Baltic Sea will not change. They hope that Germany will take this into account. From a technical point of view, the process of Soviet Russia building new battleships will not be completed until 1943. The tonnage of the country's battleships will not increase immediately. This can reassure Germany. (Havas, 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Commercial Inspection Group Arrives in the Philippines: Overseas Chinese Express Warm Welcome, Will Take Transportation to Java on the 6th <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Manila Correspondence: The Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group, sponsored by the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, departed from Shanghai on the China Java Company's "Cheyne" ship on July 16. It first went to Manila in the Philippines and arrived at noon on the 23rd. It was warmly welcomed by the local overseas Chinese. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Welcome at the Wharf</p>
<p>The ship arrived at the port at 11:30 a.m. Consul Mo stationed in the Philippines, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Li Qingquan, Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang in the Philippines Shi Guoquan, Wu Jiqiu, and Chamber of Commerce representatives Gui Huashan, Xu Youchao, Xue Fenshi, Lin Shangchou, and more than one hundred newspaper reporters were already waiting at the pier. As soon as the ship docked, they boarded the ship to express their welcome. Subsequently, the members of the delegation disembarked, took photographs, and then took cars to the Great Eastern Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Separate Visits</p>
<p>At 3 p.m., the head of the delegation, Gao Shiheng, the deputy head, Hu Dacheng, and the secretary, Yang Chonggao, led by Gui Huashan, visited Consul General Li stationed in the Philippines, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and the General Branch of the Party Headquarters. The leaders received them cordially and inquired about the situation in the country. At that time, Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters interviewed them one after another and competed to take photographs. They also plan to visit various authorities of the Philippine government and President Quezon within days.</p>
<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>After arriving in the Philippines, the delegation issued a joint declaration as a substitute for a written interview, stating that Nanyang is an area where overseas Chinese from our country gather, with vast territory, a large population, fertile land, and abundant special products. It has a long historical relationship with our country. Overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the motherland, both in spirit and material, and their enthusiasm for promoting and using domestic products is especially admired by the people of the country. In recent years, overseas Chinese have organized inspection groups to return to the motherland for sightseeing and to visit domestic product factories. They believe that domestic product industries have made significant progress in both quality and quantity. However, many overseas Chinese are unaware of this, and the domestic industrial community also believes that what is suitable for domestic sales may not be entirely suitable for foreign sales promotion. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, therefore, has organized the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group. Foreign trade with Europe has various relations and is not easy to start at once, so we must start with Nanyang first, because Nanyang is still a good market. Please first describe the ten major objectives of this delegation's visit to Nanyang: (1) To visit the current situation of overseas Chinese; (2) To convey the recent situation of the motherland and the achievements of active construction; (3) To announce the current situation of the domestic product community in the motherland; (4) To investigate the living conditions of overseas Chinese and the daily necessities they use, and to study improvements to suit the psychology and preferences of consumers; (5) To investigate the trends of the market and the general level of purchasing power; (6) To contact the overseas Chinese business operators to discuss methods for promoting domestic products; (7) To investigate the currency and exchange situation in various places; (8) To investigate the standards for collecting taxes and the procedures for transportation; (9) To contact overseas Chinese, introduce domestic products, and establish close contact with the domestic industrial and commercial community; (10) To visit the local highest authorities and exchange opinions. Therefore, this delegation has been here after several months of detailed preparations and has brought thousands of domestic product samples with it. Every time it arrives at a place, it will hold a public exhibition. After the exhibition period, the samples will be left in the local area to establish a more permanent domestic product display hall for the overseas Chinese to criticize and advise. We also hope to learn more from the local overseas Chinese and to conduct earnest consultations in order to communicate opinions and cooperate with each other for the purpose of mutual benefit. We do not come here with the hope of dumping products, nor do we want to use social interaction as a skill. The members of this delegation are all comrades who are actually engaged in industrial and commercial operations. We do not pursue false fame or rely on ideals, but only engage in investigation and take a pragmatic approach. We deeply hope that after this inspection, overseas Chinese in Nanyang and domestic industry and commerce will establish a close and lasting connection to revitalize our country's commercial position in the Nanyang market and prevent it from being replaced by others. This is what the members of this delegation earnestly pray for. However, as the comrades have just arrived in this area, we are unfamiliar with the place and have limited abilities. We must rely on the guidance and assistance of our overseas Chinese. Furthermore, the comrades are usually engaged in industrial and commercial operations, and we are deeply ashamed of our lack of literary skills and limited knowledge. There are many omissions and deficiencies. If we are given advice to correct our shortcomings and avoid mistakes, we will rely on your permission.</p>
<p>Itinerary in the Philippines</p>
<p>The delegation plans to stay in the Philippines for a week. The itinerary is as follows: From July 27 to August 2, a domestic product exhibition will be held. At the same time, each day, groups will be divided to hold joint discussion meetings with local trade associations (various trade associations in the Philippines). On August 3, 4, and 5, the members of the delegation will personally go to various places to conduct on-site investigations of the commercial situation and visit important local factories. On the 6th, they will take the China Java Company ship again to leave the Philippines and go to Surabaya in Java.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Zhang Fakui Arrives at Lushan to Report on the Bandit Situation in the Four Provinces; The Bandits are Still Remnants of Fang Zhimin; Most are Children in Their Teens <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Guling Correspondence: Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of Bandits in the Border Areas of the Four Provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui, arrived at Guling on the 28th and resided at No. 95. He has been reporting to Chiang Kai-shek's residence at No. 12 on the bandit situation and suppression efforts in the border areas of the four provinces and requesting instructions on everything. According to Secretary Zhu, who came to Guling with Zhang, the red bandits in the border areas of the four provinces are still the remnants of Fang Zhimin, scattered in the border areas of the four provinces. The total number of red bandits is about 1,000, with 50-60% armed with guns. Due to years of turmoil in the bandit areas, there is a severe shortage of able-bodied men. Most of the bandits are children in their teens. Supplies are extremely scarce. The bandit leader is Huang Ligui, and most of the bandits are concentrated on the Zhejiang-Fujian border, with relatively fewer on the Jiangxi-Anhui border. The bandits adopt a policy of coming out at night and scattering when the army arrives, making it extremely difficult for the army to track them down. To completely eliminate them, it is necessary to rely on local Baojia and militia groups. However, in areas affected by bandits, many of the righteous gentry, wealthy households, and intellectuals have fled, making it extremely difficult to establish sound Baojia and militia groups. In the future, the provincial governments of the four provinces must each send senior officials to be stationed in the border areas to engage in the organization of the people and the reorganization of the militia groups. This will make it easier to achieve results. Relying solely on the army will not solve the problem, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Grain Prices Soar in Jilin; Flood Disasters and Harsh Government Combine to Form Divine Wrath and Popular Resentment; Japanese Puppet Officials and Merchants Ruthlessly Collude to Take Advantage of the Opportunity <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: Since the establishment of the puppet organization, the Northeast has been experiencing consecutive years of major disasters, and agricultural production has been greatly reduced as a result. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been continuous rain and heavy floods. The fields along the rivers have been almost completely washed away. As a result, grain prices in Jilin have soared uncontrollably. Taking the price of soybeans as an example, the price for soybeans at the station is 2.4 yuan. Soybean cakes cost 8 jiao each, and soybean oil costs 2 jiao 8 fen. In addition, rice costs 3.5 yuan, white flour costs 3.55 yuan per bag, sorghum costs 2.2 yuan, corn costs 2.4 yuan, millet seeds cost 6 jiao, and corn flour costs 5 fen per jin. Compared to this time last year, grain prices have increased by a quarter. Compared to soybeans, the increase is more than double. White flour has also risen by about 1 yuan. In addition, there is a feeling of food shortage. Recently, a lot of Xigong rice from Dalian has been entering Jilin. Grain merchants are stockpiling, and coarse grains and miscellaneous grains are entirely transported from the Acheng County area of Harbin. Amidst the soaring grain prices in Jilin City recently, grain merchants are very active, earning three times the profit. These profiteers all have Japanese puppet officials as their background, and they divide the profits equally. However, the lives of ordinary people are filled with cries of pain and complaints. There is still no hope of grain prices falling in the near future. Towns and villages upstream of the Songhua River not only have no grain to transport downstream, but farmers are still buying and transporting grain upstream from Jilin. Recently, farmers at the junction of Huadian and Yongji counties on the Songhua River are suffering from a lack of food due to the floods of last year, which resulted in meager agricultural harvests. Under these circumstances of natural disasters and harsh government, the suffering of the people has reached its extreme.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Bandit Trouble in the Border Area of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Has Been Suppressed -- Notorious Bandit in Liangshan Also Arrested <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Cao area is located in the southwestern border area of Shandong Province, close to Hebei and Henan provinces, and has long been plagued by bandits, known as difficult to govern. In order to eradicate banditry, Han Fuju established rural agricultural schools in the western Shandong area last year, providing training to increase self-defense capabilities. Over the years, more than 24,000 people in the counties of the area have received primary and advanced training, and their strength is quite strong. As a result, bandits and petty thieves have disappeared, and the people have been able to live and work in peace. Although bandits from the neighboring provinces of Dongming, Changyuan, Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Yucheng, Dangshan, and other counties occasionally raided the area, fortunately, the people were well-trained and able to suppress them immediately. On the 11th of this month, Miao Yongqing, Hu Camel, Zhang Zouwu, and other notorious bandits from Henan Province led more than 50 bandits and suddenly raided Zhangdazhuang, 60 li from the city in the southwestern border area of Heze, kidnapping six hostages. Zhang Weibin, a graduate of the self-defense class (i.e., trained civilians), and his brother were also kidnapped at the same time. Upon hearing the news, Sun Zerang, the Second District Administrative Inspector, immediately led more than 100 soldiers and students from the rural school, traveling by car and bicycle to suppress the bandits. After arriving, the bandits fled back towards Dongming. Sun Zerang led the team in pursuit, reaching the forests of the Dasha River west of Matou Town in Dongming. The bandits were about to stop to catch their breath when they saw the government troops arriving. They immediately resisted desperately. Dai Dongsheng, the leader of the government troops' squadron, bravely went forward and fought the bandits in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in his death. Wang Dexing, a student from the rural school, also died at the same time. Subsequently, Sun Zerang led the team to arrive, surrounded and attacked them fiercely, killing countless bandits and recovering four hostages, six guns, and one horse. The bandits then broke through the encirclement and fled. The kidnapped students Zhang Weibin and his brother were still not out of danger at this time, so the pursuit continued, reaching the Hongmiao area southwest of Kaocheng. The bandits then dispersed one after another, breaking into smaller groups. While searching, Zhang Weibin, the kidnapped student, took the opportunity in a village between Lanfeng and Kaocheng to kill Miao Yongqing and the other three bandit leaders who were guarding him, obtaining two box cannons. He immediately reported to the Lanfeng County Government. After receiving the news, Sun Zerang immediately sent Captain Liu Zhijun to lead a team to retrieve him and consulted with Magistrate Yang of the county to discuss the matter of capturing the scattered bandits. The county magistrate immediately sent a team to assist, and a total of more than 30 bandits and suspects of harboring them were arrested. The bandit trouble in the border area was thus suppressed. It is now reported that Sun Zerang has returned to Heze and is gathering gentry and merchants to prepare for a memorial service for the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>Liangshan is a historically famous bandit den. Although the military has severely suppressed it recently, it is still inevitable that scattered bandits gather there. Wang Qidao, a notorious bandit, nicknamed Wang Sanhanzi, also known as Lao Si, once led more than 200 bandits, fully armed with guns, and occupied Liangshan, robbing houses, kidnapping, burning, and killing, causing fear far and wide. Now, taking advantage of the rising green yarn tent, he secretly went to Yuncheng from Tianjin, using the name Fang Shouxun, and colluded with bandits from Rucheng, Dongping, Yanggu, and Shouchang counties, intending to launch a large-scale attack. An Taihe, the magistrate of Yuncheng County, led the security team and students from the self-defense class. During a meeting at the Ji Fang Zhuang, he learned that Wang Qidao was carrying several pistols and hiding at the house of Han Liu, a prostitute in Xiaoting Town. He then went there in plain clothes in the rain that night. At dawn, he arrested the bandit and obtained a pistol. It is said that the bandit was extremely fierce. When he was arrested, he even injured a member of the team with his fists.</p>

<p>Since Gui Chenqin took over the long-distance bus service on the Suzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Highway, it has been gradually reorganized. The highway from the Pingwang station on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Road to Huzhou has also been completed, and long-distance buses began operating on the 1st. There are ten round trips every day, passing through thirteen stations along the way: Meiyan, Zhenze, Naxun East Station, Naxun West Station, Dongqian, Hucun, Jicun, Jiuguan, Chenshe, Shenshan, Balidian, Huzhou East Station, and Huzhou South Station. In order to give preferential treatment to passengers between Pingwang and Huzhou, single tickets can be used as round-trip tickets within half a month. At the same time, a 30% discount is offered on round-trip tickets for the entire Suzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou route. After the road is opened to traffic, it only takes five hours to travel from Huzhou via Suzhou (or Jiaxing) to Shanghai, which is very convenient for passengers. An official opening ceremony is scheduled for September 1.</p>

<p>Xie Yaokui, a 39-year-old resident of the tenth household in the first Jia of Lihe Township, Third District, Wuxi County, was married to the Guo family and had two sons and three daughters. His family was well-off. At about 4 p.m. yesterday, Yaokui was working in the field when the sky suddenly became overcast with dark clouds, thunder rumbled, lightning flashed, and then heavy rain poured down. With a deafening thunderclap, Yaokui was struck by lightning and died on the spot, a tragic sight. His body had purple marks on the upper part and blue marks on the lower part. His mouth and eyes were open, and there were three scorched holes on his head, which was quite bizarre. At the same time, a large branch of a tree in front of the Feng family's house near the Xuezha Bridge near Xin Town was also destroyed by lightning.</p>

<p>Wen Aisheng, a farmer in the Seventh District of Wuyi County, Yancheng Township, needed to dredge a shadowy area within the Mo character-numbered base in July. He led his younger brother, Xingsheng, and hired workers such as Tian Ruigen to help with the work. Suddenly, they unearthed eight gold ingots, twelve gold bars, and gold rings, silver jewelry, and silver dollars. When weighed, the gold totaled sixteen catties and six taels, estimated at over 30,000 yuan. The gold bars were inscribed with the four characters "Lu Dian Pure Gold." After obtaining the gold, Wen Aisheng gave the workers Tian Zheng 300 yuan and then went into hiding. His younger brother, Xingsheng, then filed a report with the Department of Finance, requesting the county to investigate and hand over the hidden gold, stating that it should belong to the state to avoid harm, etc. The Department of Finance has now ordered County Magistrate Hou to investigate and report back for verification.</p>

He transferred the Dongtai Jianggang team to be stationed at Pinch, and the Yancheng Huanghekou team to be stationed at Qianqiugang. The Yangtze River patrol line was extended to Jingjiang Xingang. The Junhe warship was docked at Wusong, and the Haiying warship was docked at Tianshenggang, jointly responsible for patrolling the Shengsi Islands fishing area.</p>

<p>In Tongzhou, heavy rain has persisted for nearly ten days, causing the inland river water level to rise sharply, and low-lying fields have become swamps. Currently, all gates and culverts connecting Tongzhou to the river and sea have been opened to discharge water. Cotton seedlings have already been damaged.

<p>Ding Zhiguo, a notorious bandit in this county, is extremely fierce. Rewards have been offered for his arrest for a long time, but he has not been captured. Recently, taking advantage of the growing green crops, he has been carrying out massacres and robberies in the southwest area. Ding and dozens of his followers went to the edge of Jinjiazhuang Village, Xingzhong Township, Fourth District, intending to enter the village and rob it. However, they were discovered by the villagers, who opened fire, preventing them from succeeding. Ding then led his men into the home of Sha Kaiyuan, a farmer in Mahuzhuang Village, west of the village, killing one of Kaiyuan's sons, wounding another, and burning Sha's house to the ground. When Lu Zipei, a neighbor, heard the alarm, he gathered over a hundred militiamen from Xingzhong and Xingxi Townships and went to encircle them. The bandits were overwhelmed and fled southwest.</p>

<p>After the riots of fishermen and salt workers in Daishan, Dinghai, the local authorities took measures to appease them, and the matter subsided. Unexpectedly, because over thirty fishing boats from Fenghua returned to Daishan from the sea, careless speech caused rumors of a second riot to spread. Yu Bingxun, the new Director of the Weighing Bureau in Daishan, telegraphed Zhao, the District Commissioner, requesting him to instruct the Fenghua Fishery Association to advise the fishermen to be law-abiding and not to cause trouble. After receiving the telegram, Commissioner Zhao took the Keqiang warship from Ningbo to Daishan on the 31st to deter the situation. Furthermore, the Yanjiao Salt and Smuggling Patrol Team on Dou'ao Island, Qushan, Dinghai, discovered two to three hundred catties of uncolored fishing salt on Shen Abu's fishing boat from Fenghua on the 27th at Nantuo'ao beach. They detained the people and the boat together. At the time, many fishing boats were approaching the shore, leading to heated discussions and a noisy atmosphere. When the incident reached Chen Fengming, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, he secretly ordered the police to move the guns and important documents from the bureau to a private residence. He also immediately joined Captain Chen of the Security Team to mediate between the two sides. As a result, the patrol team released the people and the boat, confiscating the white salt, and the matter was settled. Unexpectedly, at that moment, a soldier accidentally fired a wooden-cased gun while cleaning it, wounding a soldier standing nearby in the right thigh. Upon hearing the gunshot, the residents and shops in Dou'ao on the island, thinking a great disaster had occurred, closed their doors, causing widespread panic throughout the city. Fortunately, the situation was temporary, and after the truth was clarified, order was restored.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Cereal Storage Management Committee was originally scheduled to be established on August 1st. However, because all the committee members of the provincial government went to Shanghai to meet Huang Shaohong to discuss handover matters, they returned to Hangzhou on the evening of the 31st. The provincial government meeting was postponed to the 1st. Therefore, the Cereal Storage Committee decided to postpone its establishment until next week. The Cereal Storage Section of the Construction Department will be abolished and merged into the committee. The five major warehouses in Haining, Jinhua, Linhai, Pingyang, and Yueqing are preparing to be built in August.

<p>Because the rainfall was even and the weather was suitable in Zhejiang Province this summer, the early rice harvest is abundant in various counties. The new grains of the Wenzhou-Taizhou area have already been harvested. Most of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area in western Zhejiang is planted with mid-season rice, which can also be harvested next month. It is reported that the double-cropping rice promoted in Cixi, Zhenhai, Shaoxing, Wuyi, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang has achieved good results.

<p>At 6:15 p.m. on the 30th, a fire suddenly broke out at the Hengtai Silk Shop next to the Hanshui Bridge in the bustling downtown area. The fire started on the upper floor, and flames spread rapidly with thick smoke billowing. Several off-duty policemen on the Yanghe Tea House across the river spotted it and shouted for help. Immediately, gongs sounded loudly, and citizens rushed and jostled in panic. From the main street across the Hanshui Bridge to Xiaojie, the area was surrounded by water hoses. The Jinshan Dragon Brigade from the main street and the Shoushan Dragon Brigade from Xiaojie provided the most effective assistance, and the fire was extinguished after a while. The shop has been open for about twenty years. Due to its good management and timely purchase of the latest foreign goods, it has been able to stand out in the sluggish silk industry and accumulate a lot of wealth. This time, the accounting room was destroyed, and the modern clothing materials piled up upstairs and downstairs were all flooded with water. The shop had fire insurance with a Shanghai company and has telegraphed to request an investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Letter from Zou Yuou <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>To the Editors of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Regarding the item in your "Overseas Correspondence" column on July 30th, which stated that the Wuxi Railway Gu Stationmaster, luggage room director, and staff members organized a smuggling ring, and that after being discovered by the railway bureau, the deputy stationmasters and relevant personnel were given demerits on the 2nd of this month; and that Zou Yuou, the former director of the Second Section stationed in Wuxi, was also involved with the smuggler Wang Xingen, and was dismissed from his position, etc., I was surprised upon reading it. After investigation, Yuou was suspended from his position by order of the Railway Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Railways on March 29th of this year. He completed the handover of his duties immediately and moved to Nanjing to live in leisure. Since he held no position, there was no dismissal to speak of. Moreover, the dismissal of the stationmasters and staff members of Wuxi stations due to the smuggling case occurred on the 2nd of this month, several months after Yuou left the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. What your newspaper reported does not match the facts. In addition to investigating the source of the report, please correct it immediately. Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zou Yuou</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Prospect of Turmoil in Spain <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The entire country of Spain is now in a fierce civil war. This turmoil is not only a domestic political struggle but also concerns the overall situation in Europe. Now, let's briefly explain the immediate causes of this turmoil.</p>
<p>Since the Spanish Popular Front won the election in February, the Fascists and right-wing parties have been plotting to seize power again almost every day. On the 12th of this month, when Spanish Royalist leader Sotelo was assassinated, the political situation in Spain became even more unstable. Plots of Fascist coups were uncovered almost daily. The rebellion of the Spanish Moroccan garrison and part of the domestic army launched on the 18th was a pre-planned scheme by the Royalist Party and the Fascist Party. According to their plan, they would first launch the rebellion in Morocco, then start uprisings in the country, and then converge directly on the capital. Now, the civil war is raging, and although the situation is still unclear, the fronts of both sides are very obvious: on one side is the Popular Front, supported by the vast majority of the farmers and workers who account for 80% of the Spanish population. On the other side are the rebel army, including the Royalist Party, the Fascist Party, and the big landlords and capitalists, reportedly backed by Italy and Germany. The Spanish Popular Front and the Fascists have reached a decisive battle. Spain has stepped onto an inevitable stage in the historical process.</p>
<p>It has been a full five years since Spain experienced an unprecedented revolution in 1931, overthrowing the thousand-year-old throne and establishing a new republican system. During these five years, the Spanish revolutionary movement has progressed through a difficult process. Peasant unrest, worker strikes and demonstrations, and the autonomy movements of oppressed ethnic groups in Catalonia, Basque, and Asturias have never stopped. This is because the Republican government cannot solve the various contradictions in social economy and ethnic issues. Although the imperial system has been overthrown, the power of the landlords is still very strong, the peasants still live the poorest inhuman life, the liberation of ethnic minorities has not been realized, and the status of labor has not been improved—it is estimated that the number of unemployed people has reached one million. Since social and ethnic contradictions are so acute, they are naturally deeply reflected in the continued political instability.</p>
<p>Originally, most of the past Republican governments were controlled by the right wing of the capitalist group. Under the threat of revolution, this regime accelerated to the right. Before September 1933, although the Azana cabinet, which was relatively "left," appeared for a while, it was soon overthrown. Azana was the leader of the left-wing Republican Party. Under his rule, he confiscated some aristocratic lands and slightly implemented land distribution reforms, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the nobles and big landlords. Succeeding Azana was Lerroux, representing the financial capital group, but Lerroux was soon overthrown by the united front of left-wing parties. The successor was the weak and incompetent Samper. Because of the fierce struggle between the left and right factions, the Samper cabinet was soon squeezed down. The Fascists repeatedly put Lerroux on the stage. With the active support of the right wing, Lerroux used iron-fisted policies to suppress the revolution of October 1934. Later, "Spanish Hitler" Luchs was appointed Minister of the Army, and thus the Spanish regime took the road of Fascism. By September of last year, the Fascist Party was dissatisfied with Lerroux again, reorganized the cabinet several times, and put Portela Valladares on the stage. All of them were puppets of the Fascist Party. This Valladares cabinet was overthrown in mid-February of this year due to the victory of the Popular Front in the general election.</p>
<p>The victory of the Spanish Popular Front was not an accident, but an inevitable result of the successful political base for the United Front of the objective situation in Spain and all strata and political parties. The more the power of the Popular Front progresses, the more intense the joint offensive of the reactionary parties will be. This is probably the inevitable "logic" of the development of social struggle. The planned large-scale rebellion provoked by the Royalist Party and the Fascist Party reflects the power of the Spanish Popular Front. In this confrontation between the rebel army and the government army, we have seen that the peasant and worker masses have organized their own militias, heroically standing up as the backbone of the government. From this, we can also see the profound mass base of the Popular Front. With the support of the broad masses, we feel that the Spanish Popular Front will not completely fail. Of course, with the joint support of the international Fascists, the right-wing rebel army in Spain may temporarily take the place of the current government. At that time, Italy and Germany will seize the opportunity to take advantage of the situation, and the international situation will change. However, given the depth of its internal contradictions and the hatred of it by the majority of the Spanish people, even if this possibility is realized, it may not be sustainable.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Explains Doubts Regarding Stamp Duty <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to a letter from the Liangyou Factory, stating, "In response to your letter of the 31st of this month regarding various points concerning the method of affixing stamp tax, we have understood the details. Our response is as follows: (1) If the stamp is a two-part form, the part given to the customer should be stamped, and the part kept in the store for verification is, according to Article 3 of the Implementing Regulations of the Stamp Tax Law, a copy that is completely identical in content to the original, only for verification purposes and not for use. Based on Article 3, Section 7 of the Stamp Tax Law, it is not necessary to affix a stamp. (2) If both the remittance slip to the bank and the receipt given to the other party are fully stamped, then according to Article 12 of the Implementing Regulations of the Stamp Tax Law, which states that "various bills that should be subject to stamp tax according to the Stamp Tax Law, if bound into booklets, should be stamped for each item before use or delivery," it is not necessary to affix stamps to the booklets themselves. (3) The handbooks used by workers to receive wages from the factory, according to the regulations in Item 4 of the tax-exempt column of the Stamp Tax Rate Table, do not need to be stamped. (4) The price list is not specified in the Stamp Tax Rate Table. Its effect, before a transaction is completed, is to attract customers and is different in nature from invoices and bills, so it does not need to be stamped. (5) Although temporary receipts are not specified in the tax-exempt column of Item 2 of the tax rate table, by analogy with temporary subscription receipts and temporary vouchers, it seems that they may be exempt from stamping. The Chamber has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for instructions, but has not yet received a reply."</p>

<h3 id="e108">Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Petitions Ministry of Industry to Strive for Sovereignty in Factory Inspections. Tragic Accidents in Factories in the Concession are Commonplace. If Improvements Are Not Made Soon, Where Will the Disasters End? <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry stating, "The issue of factory inspections in the Shanghai International Settlement has been under negotiation for five years. During this time, the municipal government has repeatedly negotiated with the concession authorities. Only in June of this year did the Municipal Council and the municipal government jointly draft an agreement on factory inspections in the International Settlement. The content of the agreement is barely satisfactory, and we were looking forward to its implementation to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers. However, according to recent reports, after the agreement was passed by the Municipal Council's board of directors, the Consular Body believed that the agreement could lead to the abolition of part of the extraterritorial privileges granted by the treaties of countries with consular jurisdiction and demanded amendments. They believe that the agreement should only be implemented in Chinese factories 'and factories of countries without consular jurisdiction' in the concession. As for the handling of inspection matters in factories of countries with consular jurisdiction, it is a right granted by the Yangjingbang Regulations and should be handled by the Municipal Council through the issuance of licenses. According to the Yangjingbang Regulations mentioned by the Consular Body, the right to factory inspection was obtained through the issuance of licenses, but the Chinese people at the time opposed it, and the government did not recognize it. Even the Municipal Council itself found the licensing method too difficult to implement. Therefore, the grounds cited by the Consular Body are inappropriate. Furthermore, the implementation of factory inspections not only benefits workers but also reduces accidental losses for factories and ensures the safety of the entire factory. At the same time, it is also of great importance to public health and social welfare. This is a matter of the entire society and humanitarianism and should not be discussed from a diplomatic or political point of view. Recalling the boiler explosions in the Zhengtai and Taiyi factories last year, which killed and injured more than a hundred male and female workers, such tragic accidents are common in factories in the concession. If factory inspections are not implemented soon, the disasters in the future are unimaginable. In view of this, the Federation has repeatedly decided to petition your ministry to expedite negotiations on the matter of factory inspections in concession factories and to promote its early implementation. We now restate the reasons and petition your ministry to continue negotiations based on reason and strive to achieve the goal. The Federation, on behalf of more than 800,000 workers in the city, is willing to be the backing, and we present this petition urgently and with great anticipation. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Minister of Industry, Shanghai General Labor Union, by acting Chairman Zhou Xuexiang, Standing Committee Members Ye Xianggao, Nan Mengnan, Zhang Kechang, Shao Xubai, and Long Peiyun."</p>

<p>The newly appointed acting Jianghai Customs Superintendent Zhu Changnian officially received the appointment letter from the Ministry of Finance on the 30th of last month. He went to the Superintendent's Office on Xinzha Road yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. with Secretary Wu Yousan and others to formally assume office. Former Superintendent Tang Haian sent Secretary Tang Zhaoshi to handle the handover on his behalf. After Zhu received the seal of office, he immediately summoned the staff for instructions. Because yesterday was Saturday, the office was closed in the afternoon, and some handover procedures were not completed. They will need to be handled tomorrow. Zhu will also go to Nanjing to meet with Minister of Finance Kong to ask for instructions on everything and then return to Shanghai to set a date for the oath of office ceremony. Zhu issued a written statement yesterday, stating, "I have been ordered to act as the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and have come to the office today to assume office. I will then choose a date to hold the official oath ceremony. I have been stationed in Sweden, Norway, and other countries over the years, and I feel that I lack experience in customs affairs. In 1928, the government resolved to recover customs autonomy. At that time, I assisted former Foreign Minister Wang (Zhengting) in persistently striving for this goal with ambassadors from various countries, and finally achieved the goal of customs autonomy. In the future, I will continue the spirit of past efforts and work diligently under the instructions of Minister Kong. As for the staff in the office, except for a few people who will go to Guangdong with former Superintendent Tang, there will be no major changes. I hope that people from all walks of life will often give guidance to correct my shortcomings."</p>

<h3 id="e112">Sichuan Sojourners Association in Shanghai Cables Request to Punish Smuggling Sichuan Merchants, Chongqing Customs Detains 500-600 Bags <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Sichuan Sojourners Association in Shanghai recently cabled a request to the government to stop Sichuan merchants from transporting smuggled goods and to punish the treacherous merchants. The telegram is as follows: (Titles Omitted) "We recently received a letter from the Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association, stating that eleven member firms reported that the Chongqing Customs had detained more than 600 bags of smuggled goods shipped from North China to Sichuan, estimated to be worth 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The consignees of these postal bags are Chengdu Transportation Company, Jin Longtai, Zhenxing Company, Jin Yichang, Jin Yisheng, Yipuheng, Baoyuanlong, Tongtaichang, and other firms. We believe that smuggling in North China affects national tax revenue and the livelihood of legitimate merchants nationwide, harms the country, and poisons the people of Sichuan. Therefore, we request the Public Welfare Association to forward this report to the Chongqing Superintendent's Office and various government agencies, requesting them to thoroughly detain the smuggled goods in accordance with the anti-smuggling laws specially issued by the central government, confiscate and auction them, and punish the treacherous merchants to serve as a warning to others.' Based on this, we find that amidst the illegal establishment of a consulate in Chengdu by Japan, shameless treacherous merchants are transporting large quantities of smuggled goods, which has a profound and significant impact on our national economy. To protect the country and the nation and to care for the interests of our hometown, we specially cable your Yuanbu to stop smuggling, legally detain the goods, and severely punish the treacherous merchants to serve as a warning to others and to maintain the rule of law." Sichuan Sojourners Association in Shanghai, bowed, East.</p>

<p>Since the labor dispute occurred in the Hongxing Sock Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession, the stalemate has lasted for a month. After persuasion from party and government organs, the workers were ordered to return to work first, and the dispute would be mediated according to the law. The workers complied with the authorities' instructions and returned to work on the 26th of last month. In order to resolve the labor dispute, the Municipal Party Department specially summoned both labor and management representatives to mediate the matter the day before yesterday. Li Yaoting, the representative of the management, and Zhang Zhuyun, Shi Xiuying, and Deng Yixin, the representatives of the labor, were present. Chairman Li Weixiong of the Municipal Party Department first inquired about the opinions of both parties. The management stated that they could not reinstate the dismissed workers Shi Xiuying and others and would give them severance pay in addition to deducting overdrafts: 80 yuan to Deng Yixin, 60 yuan to Shi Xiuying, and 40 yuan to the other six workers. However, the labor side believed that the dismissal of the workers was unjustified and did not want to be dismissed, so the mediation was unsuccessful. The labor side will submit another report to the authorities, requesting the factory to allow them to return to work in order to avoid another labor dispute.</p>

<p>Public Notice Effective August 1</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently launched a notarization system modeled after the precedents of European and American countries. Starting from August 1, Shanghai courts will be the first to pilot the system. After the Shanghai District Court of Nanshi received the order from the High Court, it specially established a notarization office in the real estate registration office and appointed a clerk to handle the matter. Yesterday, President Lu Yimei also issued a public notice stating, "Public Notice: According to Jiangsu High Court Instruction No. 523, 'In accordance with the telegram from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, it is planned to set August 1 of this year as the date for the Shanghai Special District Court and the Shanghai District Court to implement notarization, in order to ensure uniformity. In addition to separate orders, the Shanghai District Court is ordered to actively prepare and implement as scheduled, and report back.' We have prepared in accordance with this and have established a notarization office within the court, which will begin operations on August 1 of this year. In addition to reporting and separate letters, we hereby affix a copy of 'Brief Explanation of the Notarization System' and issue a public notice in advance. In the future, for legal acts such as concluding contracts or other facts concerning the creation, loss, transfer, or modification of private rights, there is no need to apply to the court for registration. You should submit a written or verbal request to the notarization office of this court to create a notarization or authenticate a private document, so that it can be protected by the power of notarization and avoid all future disputes. This matter concerns the implementation of a new system and the protection of private rights. People within the jurisdiction should be aware of this. This public notice is specially issued."</p>

<p>Buddhist Association Receives Report from the Group</p>
<p>The five members of the Sri Lanka Study Group organized by the Chinese Buddhist Association, including Ping Song, Wei Zhi, Fa Zhou, Wei Huan, and Xiu Lu, set sail from Shanghai on May 6 of this year and arrived in Sri Lanka on June 26. Their first report was published in the newspapers. The Chinese Buddhist Association received the group's second report yesterday. Excerpts are as follows: "After arriving here, we visited the major ancient temples in Colombo, the Temple of the Tooth in the ancient palace of Kandy, and the stone cave where the Pali Tipitaka was compiled, located 50 miles from Kandy. The compilation time was approximately 80 years before the Western calendar. The architecture of the Sri Lankan Buddhist temples consists of several monk's dormitories, a Buddha hall, a stupa, and a bodhi tree, which is revered by the people in the same way as the Buddha's relics. There are few monks, but they all follow the sutras. What we have learned from the sutras, vinaya, and biographies in China is almost all seen in daily practice here. Everything, everything, is as if the Buddha's world is not far away. We are now living in the deep mountains at 3932 feet, practicing sutra rituals and living here for two months. The climate here is cool, like Guling in China. It is currently the rainy season here. Two months later, we will return to Colombo to receive the precepts of a bhikkhu. After receiving the precepts of a bhikkhu, we will go to the Madena beach, about 100 miles from Colombo, to practice the Buddhist practice of living in seclusion. A week later, we will visit the Andala Zha Bu Tuo ancient temple, (transliteration), the second oldest temple in Sri Lanka, the site of the world's oldest bodhi tree. Reading the English newspapers, we learned that our homeland is in trouble again. We regret that we cannot understand the hard work of our compatriots in defending the country. If you could kindly send us a copy of the Shanghai newspaper, we would be most grateful."</p>

<p>Lung screening for elementary school teachers in the city</p>
<p>The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association recognizes that tuberculosis is rampant and deeply harmful to young people. In particular, the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis in primary schools is even more alarming.

Therefore, the health of primary school teachers is closely related to students. In order to prevent it, the association will first conduct X-ray lung examinations for primary school teachers in this city. The Municipal Education Bureau issued a notice to primary schools in the city a few days ago, instructing teachers to take turns to go to the association's first clinic for examination during the autumn semester. The examination period will last from September 1 to the end of October. It is heard that after receiving the order, the principals of various primary schools have notified teachers and staff to go for examination at that time.

Soon after, they lost their way, were captured by detectives, and sentenced to one year in prison. After being released from prison, Jin's mother taught him bitterly, and A'er made up his mind not to engage in this robbery career again, willing to endure hardship and sell fruits to support his mother. After two years of leisure, he accidentally met Zhu and Li on the road this week. They forced him to re-enter the bandit gang. Jin firmly refused and was taken to a small inn in Mantingfang, where Jin was tied up and privately executed by hanging. Later, Jin took the opportunity to bite off the rope and escaped.

At first, they softly deceived them, wanting to be sons and marry wives for them. However, the two children, Wang and Liu, were poor and unwilling to be sons. They then taught them how to throw packages, etc. The children still refused and only cried, causing the two, Hang and Heng, to be angry and tie up and whip the two children, causing them to be injured all over their bodies, saying that if they did not obey, they would be killed.

According to the corpse's wife, Zhang Wang, 29 years old, the couple had been very harmonious on weekdays, but the family was poor and there was a risk of running out of food at any time.

<h3 id="e145">Lü Fangzheng Falsely Claims to be from Hubei Provincial Bank, Forges Subsidiary Coin Tickets, Claims that Huaxin Company is Not Large, 50,000 Yuan Confiscated by Xiaguan Customs, Liu Peiqing Asks Lawyer to Report to Police Station <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Lü Fangzheng, a native of Hubei, used to be a doctor. Recently, he was suspected of forging a letter of appointment from the Hubei Provincial Bank and privately printing 50,000 yuan worth of subsidiary coins of 5 jiao, 2 jiao, and 1 jiao of the bank. Someone reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which specially dispatched Chinese detective Ma Derong and Yang Yunfeng to arrest Lü Fangzheng and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special District Court and requested to be detained. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that at noon yesterday, Yu Jizhang, a representative sent by Liu Peiqing, the owner of Huadong Engraving Company at No. 25 Maoyi Lane, No. 153 Meibaige Road, and the lawyer Li Mo reported to the police station, saying that in March of this year, the defendant Lü Fangzheng suddenly came and said that he had opened the Huaxin Printing Company in Hankou, Hubei. In January of this year, he was entrusted by Jia Shiyi, the manager of the Hubei Provincial Bank, to print 1.5 million subsidiary coins of 1 jiao, 5 jiao, and 2 jiao. However, because the Huaxin Company was not large and engraving was not its strong point, it was specially entrusted to Liu Peiqing to handle it on his behalf, clarifying that the printing fee was more than 100,000 yuan, and the profits would be split equally in the future. Because Liu had not obtained a certificate from the bank, he did not dare to agree rashly. Later, the defendant presented a letter of entrustment from the Hubei Provincial Bank as proof, and Liu believed it to be true. On March 20 of this year, Liu signed a contract with the defendant and started working. He had paid more than 3,000 yuan for raw materials and labor costs. On July 19, he first printed 50,000 yuan worth of tickets and handed them to the defendant to take to Hubei for delivery. The defendant then embarked on the Ruiyang ship and passed through Xiaguan, Nanjing. During the inspection by Jianghai Customs, the defendant became suspicious and went ashore to abscond. The forged 50,000 yuan worth of coins was confiscated. Later, the defendant sent a letter from Jiujiang to Liu Peiqing, stating the process of the coins being copied. Liu was very suspicious after reading it. Since the subsidiary coins were entrusted by the Hubei Provincial Bank, why would they be copied by the Customs? There must be a hidden reason. He immediately telegraphed Jia Shiyi in Hubei according to the address stated by the defendant on weekdays to inquire about the place, but there was no such person as Jia Shiyi in that place (it was found that Jia was the director of the Hubei Finance Office and the manager of the Hubei Provincial Bank, not a resident of that place), so the original telegram was returned, which was obviously forged. He investigated the whereabouts of the defendant everywhere. Yesterday, the defendant went to Liu Peiqing's place to ask for the return of the copper and zinc plates, so he immediately reported to the police station and arrested the defendant. Two engraved plates, eight printing plates, and a contract were copied. According to the defendant's statement at the police station, this matter was cooperated with Yang Xianqing, who is at large, in Hankou, etc. According to Liu Peiqing's complaint about the above situation, when asked, Lü Fangzheng confessed to forging the subsidiary coins, but he had made it clear to Liu Peiqing in advance that they would cooperate, etc. Judge Tan Xinzhen verified the confession and said that it was necessary to investigate the case with Nanjing Customs, so he ordered Lü Fangzheng to be detained for seven days for further interrogation. The copper and zinc plates, etc. will be stored in the warehouse first.</p>

<p>Citizens' Association of the Second Special District Sends Letter to French Consul-General</p>
<p>The Kuomin News Agency reports that the Citizens' Association of the Second Special District of this city sent a letter yesterday to the French Consul-General in Shanghai, stating that a citizen, Wang Aidi, had a verbal dispute with someone.  She was then taken to the police station by a detective from the French Concession.  Another detective, nicknamed "Fool," falsely accused her of being a prostitute and inflicted private torture on her by punching and kicking her, which caused injury to her six-month pregnancy. The next day, she suffered severe abdominal pain, and the police station released her to go home.  On the evening of the ninth, at 12:00 midnight, she vomited blood.  At about 1:00 AM, she miscarried.  Because the fetus had been injured, it died immediately after birth. The woman's condition is also very dangerous. The original letter from the Second Special District Citizens' Association to the French Consul-General and the French Police Commissioner is as follows: "To whom it may concern, according to a letter from the Third District Branch of our association, and a letter from citizen Zhu Zhou, it is stated that her niece, Wang Aidi, was standing idly at the entrance of an alley on the evening of the seventh of this month when she had a minor verbal dispute with a stranger. Two detectives, without investigating the circumstances, took the niece to the MacLellan Road police station, and then transferred her to the Lujiiawan police station.  There, a French detective nicknamed 'Fool' falsely accused her of being a prostitute and inflicted private torture on her by kicking and punching her, causing damage to her six-month pregnancy.  The next day, due to severe abdominal pain, the police station released her to go home at 4:00 PM.  On the evening of the ninth, at 12:00 midnight, she vomited blood.  At about 1:00 AM, she gave birth prematurely. Because the fetus had been seriously injured, the baby died immediately after birth. The niece's condition is deteriorating daily and is in imminent danger.  We have always admired your association's role in safeguarding citizens' rights, and we dare to state the facts. We respectfully request that you uphold justice, negotiate, and seek redress." After sending personnel to investigate, the facts were confirmed. The French detective's abuse of power, infliction of private torture, and disregard for human life are clearly violations of criminal law.  We request that your association forward a serious protest to the French authorities to punish the perpetrator in order to uphold human rights, etc.  Based on this information, it has been found that, recently, police detectives have abused their power and neglected their duties frequently.  The detective falsely accused a good woman of being a prostitute, inflicted private torture and beatings, which caused injury and miscarriage to a six-month pregnancy.  This is extremely illegal.  Based on the aforementioned facts, we hereby request that Your Excellency the Consul-General (Commissioner) thoroughly investigate and severely punish the perpetrator, and at the same time, instruct subordinates to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again, in order to maintain public order and safety for citizens. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly, and we look forward to your reply. This letter is addressed to the French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Bados, (Commissioner Fabre)."</p>

<p>Lü Zongying from Zhenjiang, 36 years old, residing at 57 Xin Yong'an Street in the French Concession, operated the Hongtai Bank on Avenue Edward VII. In April of this year, using the name of the Detai Cigarette Paper Store at 43 Yong'an Street, he obtained 200 tickets for the 22nd issue of the airline lottery from the Da Yun Company on Avenue Edward VII. In early May, he again obtained 200 airline tickets from the company in his own name and provided a promissory note for 4,850 yuan dated May 8 from Hongtai Bank. When Da Yun Company attempted to cash the note at the bank when it matured, the Hongtai Bank had already gone bankrupt and declared liquidation, and Lü had disappeared without a trace. Da Yun Company then reported the matter to the French police and requested an investigation. Only the other day, detective Tao Desheng and other detectives from the French police encountered Lü Zongying in the International Settlement. After careful observation, they followed him to the intersection of Tianzhu Tang Street on Avenue Edward VII and arrested him, taking him to the police station. Yesterday, together with the complainant, Da Yun Company representative Li Mingzhen, Lü was sent to the Second Special District Court for questioning. Judge Sun Peng, serving in the Eighth Criminal Court, presided over the trial.

<p>The Chen Huizhang Case Support Association, formed after the tragic killing of Chen Huizhang by a British sailor, will hold a reception for guests from all walks of life at the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association at Tan Jiaqiao on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, at 2:00 PM today. The telegram from the association and the declaration of all rickshaw pullers are recorded below: (1) Telegram (details omitted) It is noted that rickshaw puller Chen Huizhang was injured and killed by a British sailor. The authorities in the concession have not indicated how the perpetrators will be punished, which is deeply alarming. This is not only a matter of vital interest to our fellow Jianghuai residents in Shanghai, but also closely related to the integrity of the nation. All Chinese people should speak out in unison and strive together to protect our national rights and respect our people's lives. Filled with righteous indignation, how can we remain silent? We have convened an emergency meeting and resolved to establish the Chen Huizhang Case Support Association, the purpose of which is to seek punishment for the perpetrators and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. In addition to submitting this to the Party and government organs for record and urging serious negotiations, we are sending this telegram to express our concern for national rights and human lives. We hope you will support us and jointly send a telegram to the central government departments urging them to punish the perpetrators and uphold justice and national dignity. It would be fortunate for the nation and the people. The Chen Huizhang Case Support Association respectfully bows. (2) Yesterday, all rickshaw pullers in the city issued a declaration of support, stating: We rickshaw pullers rely on our physical strength to transport passengers and earn a meager income to make a living. It is truly miserable. Seeking compensation for pulling the rickshaw is a legitimate right. Unexpectedly, recently, a British sailor, claiming to be from a civilized nation, refused to pay the fare after riding in a rickshaw. Rickshaw puller Chen Huizhang, seeing that the fare was being denied, tried to retrieve it, but was instead beaten to death by the sailor. The circumstances are shocking. Although the occupation of rickshaw puller is humble, we are also part of the citizens of the Republic of China. The sailor dared to disregard discipline, act lawlessly, disregard sovereignty, and take human life lightly within our national territory under the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. This is deeply hateful. In order to uphold justice and maintain humanity, we cannot sit idly by. The rickshaw pullers urge the Chen Huizhang Case Support Association to negotiate and strive to achieve the goals of (1) punishing the perpetrators, (2) providing compensation, and (3) ensuring that similar incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, the 100,000 rickshaw pullers in Shanghai will vow to fight to the death. We hope that people from all walks of life will provide strong support. We will not stop until we achieve our goals. It would be fortunate for the rickshaw pullers and the nation. This declaration is hereby announced.</p>

It was stipulated that for each ton of coal produced in the future, a certain amount would be set aside as "special compensation" for those who raised and contributed the funds. This "special compensation" began last year, with funds being set aside and stored. Unexpectedly, this spring, Yuanji and three other former creditors of the Jiawang Coal Mine Company filed a civil lawsuit in the First Special District District Court against Zhang Duchen, chairman of the Huadong Coal Mining Co., Ltd., General Manager Hua Runquan, and all the directors and supervisors, including Liu Hongsheng, Xie Hengchuang, Xu Zhiyi, Bao Zidan, and Li Yuliang, a total of 14 people, requesting that the special compensation be declared invalid and that the defendants be held responsible for rescinding the resolution. While the First Special District Court was conducting the trial, Xie Hengchuang, in his capacity as a shareholder representative of the Jiawang Coal Mine Company, filed another lawsuit against Zhang Duchen, also requesting that the resolution on special compensation be declared invalid. In addition, the company's supervisor, Li Yuliang, filed a criminal complaint against Gu Zonglin and Hua Runquan, accusing them of breach of trust, etc. The dispute over "special compensation" led to both civil and criminal lawsuits. In recent months, the civil and criminal courts have repeatedly held hearings. Zhang Duchen and Liu Hongsheng hired lawyers such as Xu Shihao to present various evidence to prove that there was no violation of the law or breach of trust. The two cases filed separately by Xie Hengchuang and Li Yuliang were concluded a few days ago, and the court ruled that the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed. Only the case filed by Yuanji and the other three parties remained. Yesterday morning, Judge Tao Dejun examined the case and rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing the plaintiff's claim. The judgment stated that the plaintiff's claim was dismissed and that the plaintiff should bear the litigation costs.</p>

<p>Tao Jianhua, a local resident, 35 years old, recently established the Daya Film Company with Shen Zhong, a native of Qingpu (around the same age as Tao), at 151 Pubo Lane, Luban Road, French Concession. Tao served as the general manager, and Shen served as the general affairs director. On June 25 and 26, they placed large advertisements in various newspapers, seeking actors, actresses, and tea servants. Zhang Jiazhen, a resident of Liuhe, 41 Mofan Village, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, read the advertisement and went to the company to apply. Shen Zhong met with him and offered him the position of tea servant, requiring a deposit of 30 yuan. Zhang then managed to obtain 30 yuan in cash, deposited it in the Shanghai Bank on Baxianqiao, obtained a passbook, and handed it over to Shen along with his personal seal. On July 1, he went to the company to work. On July 4, Shen told Zhang that the manager was in Nanjing and the company needed 20 yuan and asked him to borrow it, promising to return it when the manager returned to Shanghai. Zhang believed him and borrowed the money as requested. After General Manager Tao Jianhua returned to Shanghai, he repeatedly demanded the money back, but Shen Zhong had been avoiding him for several days. Zhang became suspicious and inquired with the Shanghai Bank about the deposit, only to find that the money had already been withdrawn. He then realized that Shen and others were setting up a scam and that the company was merely a facade with no real operations. He reported the matter to the French police a few days ago and requested an investigation. Detective Chen Jiuxiang went and arrested Tao Jianhua and Shen Zhong, and seized multiple copies of the company's articles of association, which listed the names of many members of the National Government Committee, court judges, local dignitaries, five well-known lawyers as legal advisors, and one well-known doctor as a hygiene consultant, all of whom were said to be supporters. They were taken back to the police station for investigation. It was discovered that the names of all the people listed had not been obtained with their consent and were fraudulently used for advertising purposes. Yesterday morning, the defendants were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial. Judge Sun Peng presided over the trial. The Police Department's lawyer, Yao Zhaodi, presented the case, stating that the case was a fraud and required further investigation, and requested a postponement. Tao Jianhua testified that he was a sub-landlord and that the name of the general manager of the Daya Film Company was being used by others without his knowledge. Shen's testimony was evasive. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered a postponement for further hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

From 1:00 PM on the 29th of last month to 6:00 AM on the 31st, he tied Degen's hands with a leather belt and beat him all over his body with a bamboo pole, causing him to cry in pain. Neighbors Chen Dingsheng, Tang Wenying, and Madam Chen Li went to persuade him to stop, but he ignored them. A Chinese constable from number 1539 arrived and saw Degen's hands tied with a leather belt. After inquiring about the situation, he arrested Li Xiangsheng and his wife and took Degen with them to the Yangshupu police station, where they were detained separately. Degen was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital, where it was determined that he had the most severe injuries on his back and left cheek. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Public Works Department's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, presented the case and requested a trial. Constable number 1539 and witnesses Chen Dingsheng, Tang Wenying, and Chen Li testified to what happened. Degen showed his injuries, which were severely bruised. Li Xiangsheng testified that Degen had stolen things and eaten watermelon, but his testimony was evasive. Li Huang stated that her former husband was also surnamed Li and that Degen was her biological son and that she did not participate in the beating. Judge Xiao Bianfen sentenced Li Xiangsheng to six months imprisonment and acquitted Li Huang.</p>

<p>Ren Zhicheng, a native of Ningbo, 19 years old, is an apprentice at the Huixia Silk Weaving Factory at numbers 13 to 17 Huaiying Lane, Taopeng Road, Hudong. Zhang Rongmei, a 23-year-old woman from Taizhou, works at the factory. She is already married and is considered attractive. Because Ren Zhicheng and Zhang Rongmei worked together day and night, they developed affection for each other. Soon, they had a closer relationship. However, Ren was also already married. Moreover, there were many eyes and ears in the factory, making it difficult to be open about their relationship. However, it was soon exposed, and they were ridiculed by their colleagues. Ren Zhicheng was afraid that someone would make trouble. Therefore, on the evening of the other day (July 30), he secretly accompanied Zhang Rongmei to the Shenzhou Hotel at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Fuzhou Road, renting room 218 for a rendezvous. At that time, they paid a room fee of three yuan. However, Ren was only an apprentice and had no large sums to spend. After only a day and a night, they were running out of money. They wanted to leave but could not, and their desire for pleasure could not continue. Not knowing what to do, they suddenly had a strange idea. Yesterday morning, around 11:00 AM, they both swallowed dozens of burnt ends of cigarettes, pretending to commit suicide. Shortly after, they used hemp rope around their necks to simulate hanging themselves. However, Zhang Rongmei, after swallowing the burnt ends of cigarettes and feeling the rope around her neck, felt her heart pounding and became nauseous, vomiting repeatedly. At that time, the waiter on the floor heard the sound and thought it was heatstroke. He hurriedly pushed open the door and saw the two lying on the bed with hemp rope around their necks, pretending to hang themselves. He was greatly shocked and immediately reported it to the police and removed the rope from their necks. Soon, an ambulance arrived and took the two to the hospital. After examination, it was discovered that they had not ingested any poison and their minds were very clear, just like ordinary people. After questioning them, they told the truth, hiding their mouths, which was truly an amusing story.</p>

<p>Hongkou Epidemic Hospital Busy with Clinic The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital at the north end of Xiangyan Bridge, Yucai Road, Hongkou, has been expanded by the sponsorship of local gentlemen and merchants, Honorary Dean Zhu Jingjing and Feng Bingnan, for ten years. It provides diagnosis and treatment day and night, and hospitalization is free of charge. Every summer and autumn, the expenses for three months require 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, which is all obtained from donations. The poor and sick in that area have benefited greatly. Since the clinic opened on June 20 this year, the number of consultations has reached 13,026 by the end of July. In addition to 2,243 cholera vaccinations, most patients suffered from acute gastroenteritis. There were also 491 hospitalizations. A total of 34 patients were critically ill and rescued with saline injections, with good results. Since the opening of the clinic, only one person has died from the severity of the disease. It is expected that the number of consultations this year will be more than 25,000, an increase of about onefold compared to the 10,198 consultations in the 77 days of the clinic last year. Therefore, the medical director of the hospital, Zhu Xiaofang, and doctors Lin Chunshan, Ni Yushi, Shan Huimin, Zhu Wenjun, Lu Songya, and Chen Chuanren, are all extremely busy.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I read a news item in the Shanghai News section of your August 1st newspaper titled "Sichuan Students in Shanghai Universities Oppose Japan Setting Up Consulate in Chengdu," which stated, "The Sichuan Students in Shanghai Universities, considering it concerns their hometown, specially convened a joint meeting of Sichuan student associations from various schools at the China Society yesterday."

<p>— Xu Xiaochu</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, very few Japanese people wore Western suits, but now it is very different. Western suits are convenient to wear and easy to express spirit, so naturally more and more people wear them. However, the raw materials for the Western suits worn by the Japanese are all Japanese goods. So wearing a Western suit does not necessarily mean not loving the country, and those who promote domestic goods do not necessarily have to turn back the clock and advise people not to wear Western suits. The most important thing is to quickly find a way to manufacture various Western suit materials. This is just an analogy. All domestic goods can be inferred in this way. Compared with advocating by following the trend, advocating against the trend has very different results. Otherwise, merely using the good name of patriotism to forcibly suppress people's desires and make them use items they do not like, even if it can be effective for a while, it is absolutely impossible to last. If we adopt this method entirely to promote domestic goods, I dare say that we will not succeed in our lifetime. Therefore, taking advantage of the situation, catering to the trend, and pleasing people are all things that domestic goods manufacturers should pay special attention to under the creed of "standardization." Fine and durable goods that cater to the psychology of the times are the basic conditions for sales. And publicity and distribution should not be neglected. I remember seeing a pair of porcelain vases with burned materials produced by Jianhua Company given by Chairman He Jian of Hunan at a friend's house one day. The patterns and colors were very lovely. Another friend wanted to buy them in the city, but unexpectedly, he could not buy them in all the major companies and domestic goods stores in Nanjing Road. Also, in the commodity exhibition hall of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I saw several kinds of women's cattail fans, which were produced in Ningbo. The coloring was unique and the style was beautiful. In my opinion, this kind of cattail fan must be popular with modern ladies and can be sold in foreign shops. Also, the bamboo mats in Anqing are exceptionally well-made and are by no means inferior to those in Taiwan, and the price is especially low. Unfortunately, they are still not easy to buy in the city. There are countless similar situations, so ineffective publicity and promotion are also a major shortcoming of those who sell domestic goods. All our domestic goods manufacturers must pay close attention to this point.</p>
<p>The above is all for our domestic goods manufacturers. As for how to correct the Chinese people's wrong psychology towards domestic goods, it is also the most important point in promoting domestic goods. I often hear people say, "Eastern goods are not as good as Western goods. Domestic goods are not as good as Eastern goods." Although it cannot be said that all Chinese people have this mentality, it can be asserted that it must be in the minority. It's really annoying that the more economically capable people are, in other words, the higher the standard of living, the so-called upper class people, the less they use domestic goods, so the sales of domestic goods are mostly in the middle and lower classes. I don't know if it's because the middle and lower classes have insufficient financial resources and simple lives, so they have to use domestic goods in a simple way, or if they have a relatively strong sense of national concept. The most easily seen thing is the cigarettes smoked by the upper class. No matter in Shanghai, Nanjing, or elsewhere, regardless of profession or gender, when you take them out, they are either Gallic, Three Cannons, or Black Cat, Three Five, and Mipanpai. It seems that anything less than this is not enough to show wealth, and it seems ashamed to take out domestic goods such as Baijialong, Good Luck, Beauty, and Golden Mouse. Especially pitiful, for example, the cosmetics displayed in the dressing rooms of wealthy ladies are almost all imported. It seems that displaying domestic cosmetics on the dressing table is indecent, and even if they actually use domestic goods, they only hide them in the cabinet and are unwilling to display them publicly outside. If the behavior of the ignorant and unknowledgeable people is like this, it's still fine, but almost all intellectuals cannot be excluded. Are you sad or not? Chinese people are promoting domestic goods with such "insincerity". I don't know when it will be officially effective.</p>
<p>I think in order to promote domestic goods, on the manufacturer's side, we should (1) strive to improve the quality of goods and adapt to the needs of the times. (2) Pay attention to publicity and promotion. (3) Set up more domestic goods companies and domestic goods exhibitions to provide opportunities for the production community and consumers to come into contact with each other. As for the national level, we should change our wrong ideas, respect domestic goods, and be happy to use domestic goods as a psychological construction for the national promotion of group goods. In this way, the domestic goods industry will flourish and can be expected. And the economic lifeline of the country and the crisis of the national banner can be saved by this. Otherwise, economic subjugation is even faster than military subjugation. I am also a member of the domestic goods business and I would like to encourage you all. (End)</p>

<p>Central News Agency Special Correspondent, Berlin, 31st: The International Olympic Committee held a meeting on the 31st. As a result, it passed a resolution with 36 votes against 27 to hold the next Olympic Games in Japan. Our country's representative, Wang Zhengting, voted in favor. According to Mr. Wang after the meeting, he hopes that the people of the country will intensify their training within four years so that they can achieve good results in the next Games.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Berlin, 31st: The 300th meeting of the Olympic Committee, a subsidiary, was held at 10:30 AM here at the Adlon Hotel. Chairman Latour asked the committee members of various countries to decide on rules in their own countries to curb the abuse of the Olympic emblem. At this time, the Chinese representative, Mr. Wang Zhengting, suddenly requested to speak, explaining the process of the Far Eastern Games dispute and the national stadium, and hoping that the Olympic Committee would resolve this issue. The Japanese representative, Count Soejima, replied that he and Mr. Wang Zhengting had reached an understanding and would resolve this issue through personal agreement before the start of the Games. Therefore, the committee did not adopt Mr. Wang's proposal. At 11:40 AM, the chairman announced a break. All committee members attended a luncheon hosted by the sports officer until the meeting resumed at 3:05 PM and decided on the location of the next World Games.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Berlin Special Dispatch, 31st: The Olympic Committee continued its meeting today and voted to decide the location of the 1940 Olympic Games. As a result, with a ratio of 36 votes to 27, it was decided to hold the Games in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>Voting Process</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Berlin, 31st: A fierce situation unfolded when the Olympic Committee's third-day meeting decided on the location of the next World Games. Before the vote was taken, Japanese representative Kano stated that Japan does not insist on the Winter Games. Then Chairman Latour declared that the vote would be taken. At the same time, the staff distributed two voting papers to the representatives of each country, one printed with "Tokyo" and the other with "Helsinki." Each representative took the one they wanted to vote for, sealed it in an envelope, did not write their name, and handed it to the chairman. British Committee member Barrett counted the votes, and Mr. Latour reported the number of votes. As a result, Japan won the location of the Games by a difference of nine votes. Amid applause from the whole venue, Mr. Kano stood up and made a simple speech of thanks. Finnish representative Crogius celebrated Japan's victory in a solemn manner. Other committee members shook hands with the representatives of both Japan and Finland.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Celebrate</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berlin, 31st: After the International Olympic Committee announced this afternoon that the next Olympic Games would be held in Tokyo, hundreds of people from various countries, including 35 Japanese journalists, surrounded Mr. Kano, the chief Japanese committee member, and congratulated him. When the Japanese residents here heard the news, they were all overjoyed and immediately decided to hold a large-scale celebration tonight to mark the occasion. They also told everyone they met on the streets that Japanese sports have made great progress in recent years, and the decision of the International Committee is a reward that the Japanese people deserve.</p>
<p>Kano's Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Kano, the chief committee member of the country, recently stated that Japan has always upheld the spirit advocated by the ancient Greek Olympic Games and the Olympic Games. However, the location of the modern Olympic Games has been limited to countries in Europe and America. As for Asian countries becoming the host of the Games, Japan is the first. This is truly gratifying. The purpose of the Olympic Games is, of course, to promote sports first, but there is also another great purpose: to bring the people of all countries closer together. We Japanese will do our best to show foreigners the true spirit of Japan. At this time, I am extremely happy. What I can say is that Japan is not only proud of this honor, but also grateful without limits. I also believe that this move will greatly contribute to the idea of international peace.</p>
<p>Chairman's Remarks</p>
<p>The Chairman of the International Committee, Baillet Latour of Belgium, also told our reporter after the committee meeting that "the committee members of all countries present at the meeting expressed great sympathy for both Japan and Finland, who were competing for the host of the next Games, and did not show any bias towards either side. Therefore, the formation of this resolution was not easy. However, the majority of the committee members believed that holding the next Games in an Asian country would promote the true spirit of the Olympic Games to faraway places. This is one of the reasons for Japan's victory. I now congratulate the country and am confident that it will organize the 12th Games in accordance with the traditional spirit of the Olympic Games and be up to the task. In the future, when a certain northern country is the host of the 13th Games, I know that the relationship between Europe, America, and Asia in sports will become even stronger."</p>
<p>Finland Disappointed</p>
<p>After hearing about this meeting, the Finnish delegation also told our reporter that Finland has no choice but to obey the decision of the International Committee. We congratulate Japan on this honor. However, we cannot help but say that the International Committee's decision is unfair to Finland, because Finland has been devoted to sports for 25 years. Recently, the mayor of Helsinki, Mr. von Frenckell, has already made a request to hold the Games in Helsinki in 1944.</p>
<p>Tokyo Rejoices</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: Prime Minister Hirota said, "I am overjoyed to receive the report that the next World Games will be held in Tokyo. The year 1940 is the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan. Holding the Games in this special year is especially commemorative. All Japanese people should make this Games the most meaningful in order to promote the progress of national sports and promote the strengths of the national character." The chairman of the Tokyo Olympic Bidding Committee, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa, also sent a telegram to Chairman Latour of the Olympic Committee to express his gratitude for the decision to hold the next World Games in Tokyo. Minister of Education Hirao also sent telegrams of thanks to the two representatives in Berlin, Kano and Soejima, the head of the delegation, Hiranuma, and the ambassador to Germany, Kojiro Ushioda.</p>

<p>Havas Agency, July 31st, Berlin: After the International Olympic Committee voted on the location of the next Games, it also resolved that all committee members would jointly write to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, requesting that the Nobel Peace Prize for this year be awarded to Baron Pierre de Coubertin (note: Mr. Coubertin is 73 years old this year and lives in a village in Switzerland. Because of his age, he is unable to travel far and could not come to Berlin to participate in the grand event), the founder of the modern Olympic Games. It was also decided that after Mr. Coubertin's death, his remains should be buried in Olympia, Greece, so that this great benefactor of the sports world and the legacy of the ancient Greek Olympic Games will last forever.</p>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Geneva, August 1st: When the Olympic torch was lit in the Berlin stadium, illuminating the light of the World Games, the German Consulate here, on behalf of the German Prime Minister, presented a souvenir to Count Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games.

Upon learning of this news, Count Coubertin sent a telegram to Hitler, wishing him every success as the sponsor of the 11th World Games. In addition to these gifts, Count Coubertin received countless congratulatory telegrams from all over the world today.</p>

<p>National Maritime News Agency, Berlin, July 31st: On the eve of the opening of the World Games, the 70-odd athletes from China are all spirited.

<p>In the draw for the soccer and basketball matches, the Chinese team was unfortunately matched with strong opponents, because the latter was matched with the Japanese team, and the former was against the English team, the birthplace of soccer. However, the Chinese soccer team believes that it will put on a considerable hard-fought performance against the English team. The Chinese swimming team is also working hard day and night with the European swimming teams in the World Games. According to swimming experts, the Chinese athletes have reached a high level in terms of both performance and technique.</p>

<p>— Jiang Huaiqing</p>
<p>(II) Meaning</p>
<p>Pierre de Coubertin, the reviver of the modern Olympic Games, explained the original intention of the Olympic Games as follows:</p>
<p>"The restoration of the Olympic Games, under the conditions of modern life, gathers the people of the world together once every four years. The competition of peace and courtesy can organize the supreme form of internationalism."</p>
<p>"Above all, to preserve in competitive sports the noble and heroic qualities that have made people outstanding in the past, and to enjoy in the educational status of today's people the same admirable status as that made by the ancient Greek people's education."</p>
<p>"Competition is gradually spreading all over the world, and it has replaced the unhealthy entertainment and harmful wandering of youth. People in society must have their special shortcomings. True competitive sports can eliminate their evils and promote a healthy national spirit."</p>
<p>"It is difficult to judge to what extent the Olympic concept has progressed, but judging from the various aspects of its inception, its definition is very clear: (1) to create and enhance the friendly relations of peaceful communication between civilized countries; (2) to clarify and eliminate the selfish and fraudulent means in competitive sports, to seek games that everyone can get a fair judgment, and to make competition not use victory as the joy of youth."</p>
<p>"In short, the World Olympic Games has the goals of social education and morality: in the social aspect, it enables people to have a spirit of understanding each other. In the educational aspect: (1) to develop physical education to an active and rational development; (2) to establish public playgrounds. In the moral aspect: (1) the spirit that sports should have; (2) the movement of the masses. In short, to protect and promote pure amateur sports. Dedicated people over the years are there."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market conditions on the Chinese Securities Exchange were still weak and unable to recover. In the past, when prices rose, the bulls in the market were too eager, and the August futures were actually raised by 1-2 yuan compared to July. The bulls in the market were crowded, and the environment was slightly unfavorable. The outbreak of selling started, and the retracement was rapid. The partial problem in Guangxi Province was certainly irrelevant to the overall situation. Although the market price fell, the market atmosphere was still stable. The major bullish players have not yet emerged. The current situation is that the floating multi is still unstable, and there may still be a possibility of continuing to decline slightly. Yesterday, the opening price of number 43 was quite buying, but the selling parties were numbers 10, 47, and 54, etc., so the market price fell sharply. The current month's Dingzhong fell sharply by 7.5 jiao, and the rest fell by 5-6 jiao. Number 5 bought Dingzhong at the settlement price. Initially, it seemed slightly stable, but after entering, number 5 switched to selling, and numbers 10 and 33 sold off very strongly. The market price gradually became unsustainable, so the subsequent columns continued to fall by 2-3 jiao. The result of the market price continued to fall by 4.5 to 9.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 5.65 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<p>Also, the half-day trading has already expired. Due to the still hot weather, the suspension of afternoon trading will continue for one week.</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the downward trend is very strong. It is reported that the Kwangsi Army is taking an offensive against the Cantonese generals, so people are shocked. The Cantonese are stopping the purchase of cotton yarn, which makes it more difficult for the market to stabilize. Although Osaka Sampin yarn stepped up and rose by two or three yuan, it is still difficult to arouse excitement.</p>
<p>Lack of Buyers for Standard Yarn</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened flat due to a lack of buyers and poor sentiment, all of which favored the shorts. The market became weaker and weaker, with each month falling by 7.8 jiao. However, the far months were stable. After the second session, it was heard that the business of the Guangdong merchants was stagnant and the situation in Kwangsi was serious. At the same time, the factories sold short in the far months, and the bulls waited and watched. It fell sharply by 8.9 jiao to more than one yuan. By the close, the near-term decline was strong and the long-term slightly recovered. It is said that San Tou Da Chang Cheng sold a large amount, but Chang Feng tried hard to buy in. As a result, the near-term price fell by three yuan compared with the previous day's closing price, and the long-term price fell by one yuan. It was found that Tong Ji sold 1,000 bales, Yu Da 2,500 bales, Jin Chang 1,150 bales, Ming De 1,200 bales, He Xing 2,550 bales, Rui Da 1,600 bales, Xiang Tai 700 bales, Ren Feng 2,300 bales, Da Chang Cheng 4,200 bales, Yi Chang 1,750 bales, and Run Kang 1,950 bales.

<p>Because of the peaceful situation in the overseas Indian and American cotton markets, the bulls are in a relaxed mood, and the shorts are particularly active. In addition, the weather has been relatively mild recently, and foreign newspapers report that the national cotton production is a bumper harvest. Therefore, those who are shorting new cotton are very enthusiastic, and the market is in trouble. However, it is said that there has been too much rain recently in the Tongzhou cotton area.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Down Seven Jiao This Month</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened with American cotton flat and Indian cotton softening. However, Osaka Sampin cotton rose by 5.6 jiao, and market sentiment was still good. Old cotton fell by 2 jiao, but new cotton rose slightly by 1 jiao. Unexpectedly, the second session opened with a sharp decline, saying that the daily newspaper reported an estimated bumper harvest of 15 million dan. At the same time, the yarn market was depressed, and sellers were stronger. The long-term fell by 2.3 jiao, and the November period broke through the one-yuan mark. The third close was normal. Chang Feng and He Yu sold a lot, and Tong Fei and Da Fu bought a lot. As a result, the August period fell by 7 jiao compared with the previous day's close, and the long-term fell by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. It was found that Da Ji sold 2,200 dan, Ming De 2,700 dan, He Xing 5,700 dan, Geng Feng 2,200 dan, Feng Tai 1,900 dan, Da Chang Cheng 1,500 dan, Chang Feng 4,700 dan, Run 1,300 dan, Jing Hua 2,400 dan, Wen He 1,100 dan, Mao Jin Da Fu 3,200 dan, Tong Ji 4,600 dan, Ju Xing 3,000 dan, Heng Yi 1,300 dan, Da Feng 2,000 dan, Chang Yu 2,100 dan, Ren Feng 2,000 dan, and Yi Chang 2,500 dan.

<p>Current Cotton Consumption Remains Sluggish</p>

<p>No Change in Yarn and Cotton Grades for January Next Year</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a cotton yarn appraisal meeting on July 28 for the purpose of delivering standard yarn for the January 26 period. The results of the review showed that the grades of 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count were the same as the previous month, with no changes. In addition, the results of the difficult review of the January period standard cotton were the same as the December period cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e206">American Cotton Trading is Quite Calm, Sampin Yarn and Cotton Rise <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with each month rising by 2 to 8 points. The industry is waiting for the government report to be released. Cotton hoarding bulls are mostly settling, and loans for cotton will not be resold, so short selling is gradually decreasing. There is heavy rain in the east, and a storm in the eastern Gulf, while Oklahoma is still short of rain. Spot trading is sluggish and trading is calm. Hestad estimates Liverpool's reserves at 281,000 bales. The Mai market was sluggish before the market opened, and local merchants sold out, and the market price fell slightly. As a result, spot prices rose by one pound and futures rose by zero to one pound. British cotton spot prices fell by 8 skulls and futures rose by 4 to 6 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to poor harvests in India and American cotton, but then turned weak due to the settlement of old bulls and large-scale selling by operators. However, some of the sell-off was absorbed by European exporters. Pingguoer fell 0.75 Robbie, Oumla fell 1.5 Robbie, and Bai Luoxi fell 1.75 to 2 Robbie. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 31st).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 1st was: Bai Luoxi for July and August was 228 Robbie, up 0.75; Zi Luoxi for April and May was 216 Robbie, up 0.75 Robbie; Oumla for December and January was 197 Robbie, up half a Robbie.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Piece Goods: Yarn and Cotton Continue to Fall, Cotton Cloth Market Softens in Futures <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a significant decrease in new transactions of cloth due to the continued softening of yarn and cotton prices. The market price of the original goods of Japanese yarn factories remained unchanged, but the asking price for September and October deliveries was about two jiao per piece lower. As a result, the industry predicts that the market price of white goods will likely fall back when new cotton enters the market in October. The most popular sales in the market were futures dyed twill flannel. The earliest Shantou merchants shipped more than one hundred boxes of dyed flannel, and forty or fifty boxes of white twill flannel. Sichuan merchants purchased more than one hundred pieces of goods such as Shilin cloth, blue cloth, yuan twill, printed colored tribute, serge, and flower flannel. Retail purchases from various routes in the Yangtze River and passenger routes such as Fuzhou and Shantou are still not quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Grains: Flour Rises with Imported Wheat, Actual Sales This Month Are Not Smooth, Market Situation Is Still Flat, and Far-Term Months Rise Again to Equal Limit Prices <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, each month showed another rise. Starting from the 9th, it rose again to the limit price of the Social Affairs Bureau. The current rebound in the market is purely affected by the rise in foreign wheat prices. Because the previous day's price quoted Chicago up 4-5 jiao, Canada nearly up 1.12 yuan, and far up 6-7 jiao to 1 yuan. Yesterday's price quoted Chicago continued to rise by 1-2 jiao, Canada nearly down 8 points, and far up 4-6 jiao. Therefore, after opening prices, people inside and outside the industry were excited and immediately raised prices by 1-2 fen. The actual sales of this month were slightly weaker, and the highest price was once 3.11 yuan, but then it was slightly flatter. September to November deliveries opened within the limit price.</p>
<p>Because sellers are restrained and buying is quite strong, all prices opened at the limit price. The initial price for December was 3.21 yuan, and then there were not many transactions and the price did not change. Because the limit price for January has not been removed, it has not been sold. The subsequent situation is that if foreign wheat falls back, the market atmosphere will be able to relax, otherwise it may become a stalemate again.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Wheat Futures Market Stable, Spot Wheat Special High-Quality Goods Are Good for 3-4 Fen <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures, after opening in the morning, the market in each month was stable. Although foreign wheat quotations mentioned the daily increase, the market sentiment was still stable, because the current arrival of goods from various routes is quite strong, and the factories' intake is not very greedy. Therefore, most of the customers' goods are sold to the exchange, and there is no lack of long and short chips, so people's hearts have also become stable, and the market is also calm. The rise is only 1-2 fen. Compared with the flour situation, the two are often out of sync. Spot wheat prices, because the prices of standard flour wheat have improved, special high-quality goods are quoted higher by 3 fen, and the medium-grade goods are as usual. However, the factories' intake is still raising prices, so there are not many large transactions. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway factory opened at 4.6 yuan for wheat, and the Zhongguan goods were 4.4 to 4.5 jiao. It is reported that Japanese merchants also bought 500-600 tons of special high-quality goods and Zhongguan goods, and the price quoted was 5 fen higher than that opened by the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market, because Ke sales were smooth and sales on this street were also strong, but the arrival of goods was less. Moreover, the number of new japonica rice was not strong, and the arrival of old rice from Heshang was also rare. Moreover, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River had Sichuan merchants purchasing it, so people were optimistic and cargo owners shouted higher prices. Then new hoarding households came to the market to absorb the goods, and prices immediately rose by 1.5 and more than 2 jiao. The total number of transactions throughout the day exceeded 10,000 bags. A total of 7,718 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,500 bags of Hunan rice, 500 bags of Shashi rough rice, and 1,450 bags of Jiangbei machine rough rice were sold. The most active intake was from local hoarding households, followed by Ningbo, Guangdong, and northern merchants.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from various merchants only included Changbang No. 2 and Xiangtang No. 1, with a total of more than 600 shi. It is understood that it was obstructed by the heavy wind and rain the day before yesterday, so although retail sales were flat, only Weihaiwei merchants purchased 150 bags of the original package of thin rice. The market situation of thick and thin rice high-quality goods can still be tight by nearly one jiao. However, Zhongsu is still flat, Duyangjian is neither prosperous nor disgraced, and Yinyuan is still firm. Zhoupu new japonica rice has been listed in the South Market, and the goods belong to the Zhoupu Yitai household, with a total of 28 shi.

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from various places in Heshang on the 17th and 18th. Because the weather was cloudy, various sales routes in the market continued to move. The price of fresh white japonica rice increased by several fen to one jiao. White Yuan stands upright, thin rice is scarce, and the price is pretty. Duerpu Ke Xian's price is tight outside the jiao, and Yang Xian's high-quality goods are scarce, and the price is increased by 2-3 jiao. The prices of other goods also show an upward trend.</p>

Moreover, lower-grade goods were more weak and fatigued than upper and middle-grade goods, and the market situation generally fell miserably, due to its soft body. Only the small mill route sold well, so it could not develop. Yesterday, the market totaled more than 1,500 bags of Kai Chengmen soybeans, more than 700 bags of Jiangqiao soybeans, 500 bags of Ruihong soybeans, 200 bags of Liufangchi soybeans, more than 200 bags of Sanyang soybeans, and 155 bags of Shaoxing and Quzhou soybeans.</p>

<p>The sesame oil market, after opening at 24.5 yuan, was once affected by the sharp rise in raw materials, and the market immediately increased to 27 yuan. In the middle of last month, Bengbu oil reopened at 27.5 yuan. Afterwards, due to the high price, sources poured in, and the market price fell to 27.2 yuan. Then, because the merchants saw that the inventory was gradually increasing, they were hesitant to move. After half a month of no transactions, 140 to 150 dan of Nansu Prefecture oil were sold yesterday, and the price was only 26 yuan, a sharp drop of more than 1.2 yuan compared with the previous price. It was purchased by local retailers. It is currently found that the inventory of sesame oil from various routes in the city is still about 20,000 cans, accounting for more than 5,700 dan.

<p>Since the outbreak of the war in western Morocco, the sales of Chinese green tea have suddenly become sluggish. Tea merchants from Britain and France are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. According to reliable information, the current situation is that the transportation and sales of Chinese tea to Europe and Africa are not hindered much, but the insurance premium has been increased compared to before. After days of brewing, the market price of Zhenmei green tea with road village drawn cores has been reduced to 112-113 yuan, a drop of 15-16 yuan compared to before.

Only the No. 4 re-export goods of Dongbai Ding Maimai were sold at 6.65 yuan, which was a small loss of 5 fen. The remaining prices remained unchanged and no transactions were made. The original factory cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 20.5 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were returned as usual.

<p>Hainan New Round Meat: Because the first plate raised the price too high, this newspaper has long expected that the market will inevitably change drastically in the future.

<p>— Hai Fan</p>
<p>The origin of income tax lies in England. The time was 1798, implemented to cover the war expenses of the Anglo-French War. Subsequently, the United States, in 1861, due to the Civil War, enacted the United States Income Tax Law. Germany, in 1920, also adopted income tax due to the post-war financial straits. France began just before the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. Italy began in 1864, shortly after the establishment of the Empire. Russia started in 1916, amidst huge war expenditures and declining tax revenues. Japan, also due to naval expansion and the necessity to reduce the Hokkaido product tax, resolutely adopted it in 1887. Other countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria-Hungary also implemented it successively. Although there were changes in the process, the primary motivation was to cope with wartime economy and financial reforms or difficulties. Today, the advancement of income tax has become global. Its amount accounts for a significant proportion of national revenue. An examination of the percentage of income tax to total tax revenue in various countries in 1932 will make this clear.</p>
<p>Given the importance of income tax in revenue, it is not that our country did not pay attention to it before. In the late Qing Dynasty, there was a proposal for income tax. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance re-submitted the new proposal, drafting regulations in the second year and announcing them in January of the third year. However, due to the broad scope and difficulty in collection, it was not implemented. In the fourth and tenth years of the Republic, detailed implementation rules were announced twice, ordering implementation, but ultimately, due to domestic turmoil, it did not gain authority. In the sixteenth year, the Nationalist Government was established, and it meticulously planned for income tax. In the eighteenth year, the Income Tax Regulations of the third year of the Republic were finally promulgated, and the implementation rules were also revised. However, the result was still ineffective. In recent years, the government, facing financial difficulties, enacted the Provisional Income Tax Regulations of 31 articles in the 24th year and included 5 million yuan of income tax in the revenue section of the general budget for the 24th fiscal year. However, by the end of the year, there were still no results. The above is a brief overview of the history of income tax in our country, which has never been effectively collected. There are several reasons why it could not be implemented, which are listed as follows: (To be continued) Market Price</p>

<h3 id="e220">Summer Vacation Special Page: A Few Things to Do During Summer Vacation <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Little friends, summer vacation has already begun! Freed from the fixed school curriculum, you must feel a great sense of relief and be very happy to be able to enjoy the long two-month vacation!</p>
<p>But you must think about it: the vacation is two months long, and it would be very uneconomical to let it pass by completely blank – time is more valuable than money! I hope you will do the following things I suggest:</p>
<p>(1) Make Up for Failing Subjects</p>
<p>In school, aren't there one or two subjects that you find very difficult to understand? During the final exams, weren't there one or two subjects that you almost or actually failed? This is because you usually think they are difficult and have a fear of difficulty, and you haven't made a good effort to memorize them, so when the final exam comes, you panic and can't answer the questions. This is enough to drag down your other subjects and lower your average score. If there are too many failing subjects, it may even cause you to repeat the grade or be demoted! I advise you not to panic. You can use this vacation to make up for these subjects, and under the guidance of your parents, older siblings, diligently review them. No matter how difficult it is, you will eventually succeed.</p>
<p>(2) Read Some Beneficial Books</p>
<p>Those of you who have passed all subjects in the final exams, in addition to still needing to review your schoolwork, can read some valuable books, such as biographies of world celebrities, scientists, etc. As for other novels, fairy tales, and stories, it is best to ask your parents or older siblings to recommend them to you. Those books with gods and monsters and absurd plots are of no benefit to read, so it is better not to read them at all. You should read the newspaper every day.</p>
<p>(3) Practice Writing and Correspond with Friends</p>
<p>In school, there is a subject called composition. Sometimes the teacher gives the topic, and sometimes it is a free topic. These are all ways to improve your Chinese and make your thinking more flexible. During the vacation, you can continue to write compositions as usual, write some narrative essays, or write some argumentative essays. Show them to your parents and older siblings for feedback. If you like drawing, you can learn to draw more during the vacation. During the vacation, you are temporarily separated from your classmates, so you can use the method of correspondence to talk to them, which can also improve your Chinese.</p>
<p>I know you will definitely be able to do the above three things. But don't study too hard either. Playtime is also essential. I think the best time for reviewing and writing is from about six to nine o'clock in the morning. The weather is relatively cooler at this time, so you won't get too tired. After finishing your homework, you should rest and play. In your spare time, you should help your mother with some small tasks around the house because your mother is too tired.</p>
<p>Only in this way can we say that we have not wasted this long vacation!</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Fearsome Summer <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Wen</p>
<p>The summer that people detest is becoming more severe day by day, hot and blazing, illuminating the entire earth, making energetic people weary, withering green and shady leaves, and causing beautiful and lovely flowers to droop. But despite your dislike, it still stands proudly there when its time comes.</p>
<p>Even wealthy people cannot withstand the threat of summer, so they stay at home, eating cold food, turning on electric fans, and enjoying themselves leisurely, except for those farmers who still work under the scorching sun, tanning their skin black and blistering it. But they have no choice but to do so for survival.</p>
<p>Even lively insects know the severity of the sunlight, and they all hide away. Only a few beautiful butterflies dance weakly in the flower bushes under the relatively weaker sunlight, and the cicadas on the willow trees chirp with shrill and pleasant cries.</p>
<p>Whether dense or sparse, the leaves droop or wither. In short, when the strong sunlight shines high, all phenomena of nature are withered and scorched.</p>
<p>The intense summer cannot last forever. When the goddess of the night is about to descend, its heat gradually weakens, and its brilliance slowly fades. At this time, everything in nature gradually becomes active again. People enjoy the cool under the bright stars and moon, engaging in lively discussions. Various insects display their skills, performing in this natural night, especially the good singers among them, as if opening a grand concert. Flowers, plants, and trees gradually return to their original state, preparing to soak up a refreshing dose of dew! But when the scorching sun returns tomorrow, people will still be weary, flowers and trees will still wither, and insects will still hide.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Summer Holiday Toys <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Liang</p>
<p>Children! In addition to reading and studying, we should also use our own hands to create things! Not only is it very interesting, but it is also enough to discover our children's intelligence and wisdom. Like Watt, who studied science as a child and later invented many things. Children, let's invent something!</p>
<p>These days are hot days. Buy a large piece of ice from the ice seller and make various scientific toys!</p>
<p>(1) Prism: A prism is a triangular glass column. When sunlight passes through this triangular glass, it separates a beautiful band of seven-colored light. However, it is very expensive to buy a prism. Let's make one out of ice to play with. You can take thick ice and place it on a hot stove to make a long, regular triangle. Then take it to the sunlight, preferably sunlight entering the room. After the sunlight passes through the triangular ice prism, you can see a beautiful band of seven-colored light on the wall, as beautiful as the rainbow in the sky. If you get such a beautiful light band for a moment, don't rush. You only need to slightly rotate the triangular ice prism in your hand so that the sunlight passes through it and falls on the wall, revealing the seven-colored light band.</p>
<p>(2) Convex Lens: Take a piece of clean and thick (must be very transparent) ice and make it into a circular shape that is thick in the center and thin at the edges. You can carefully place it on a hot stove to make it. This work is a bit difficult, but if you do it carefully, you will definitely be able to make a good convex lens. After this convex lens is made, you can use it to play. First, you can use it as a magnifying glass to read books, and the small print in the books will be greatly enlarged. You can also use it to look at other small things. But it may be a bit blurry, of course, it is not as good as a convex lens made of glass.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Thirst <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Guowei</p>
<p>Children, summer has arrived, and the weather is getting hotter day by day. Sweat is constantly dripping from your foreheads, and your mouths often feel very thirsty. Although you drink tea, your mouth becomes thirsty again after a while, unlike in winter, when drinking some tea is enough for the whole day. Isn't this very mysterious and strange? If children want to know this riddle, then let's all study the problem of thirst together.</p>
<p>(1) Why do we get thirsty? Our bodies contain a lot of water. This water is used to wash the various organs in our body. The washed water becomes sweat and urine, which are excreted from the body. At this time, because the body lacks water, it has to seek new water to replenish it. Therefore, we feel thirsty. However, why is it easier to get thirsty in summer? This is because the weather is hot in summer, and the body excretes a lot of sweat. The function of sweat is to reduce body temperature and resist external heat. Because we sweat a lot, we often feel thirsty.</p>
<p>(2) How should we quench our thirst? If we want to drink a lot of water for a long time without being thirsty, this is not right, because our body only needs to absorb a certain amount of water. The excess tea is of no use at all, and it only increases the amount of sweat. Therefore, tea should not be drunk too much or too quickly. It is best to drink it slowly and not too much. There is also a very good method of quenching thirst to introduce to children, which is to put tea in a small-mouthed bottle or a pointed-spout teapot. When drinking, let the tea flow into the throat like a line. This was invented by farmers working in the fields in southern Spain. In this way, a small amount of tea can be used to quench thirst. Isn't it convenient?</p>
<p>(3) When should we drink water and what kind of drinks should we drink? We should drink when we are thirsty, which goes without saying. And because of the different physical conditions and work of each person, we cannot specify how much time is appropriate to drink water. However, there is one thing to pay attention to: it is not advisable to drink too much after meals, as drinking too much will hinder digestion. As for the issue of beverages, the best beverage is of course boiled white water. It is not very harmful for adults to drink some tea and coffee. But children, I advise you to drink white water as the most suitable.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Summer <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>

<h3 id="e225">How to Make Sky-Blue Light Bulbs <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Bian Beichen</p>
<p>The bright and dazzling light of electric lights can greatly affect people's sleep and work in summer nights. Therefore, in summer, most people replace white light bulbs with sky-blue light bulbs because their color is soft, elegant, and blue, which is easy to induce sweet sleep and promote physical health.</p>
<p>If we go to an electrical appliance store to buy them, each one costs about three or four dimes. However, the sky-blue light bulbs sold in electrical appliance stores have a minimum brightness of 50 watts. If a family installs three 25-watt electric lights, and in summer they replace them with three 50-watt sky-blue light bulbs, assuming that each electric light is turned on for four hours every day, then the electricity bill will increase by more than one yuan per month!</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to reduce electricity bill expenses, we need to make our own sky-blue light bulbs with lower brightness.</p>
<p>The method of making sky-blue light bulbs is very simple. You only need to buy a bottle of "Celluloid Solution" from the pharmacy, and then buy a few copper-colored Prussian blue dyes from a paint store or cigarette paper store, pour them into the celluloid solution and stir. The depth of the color depends on your needs. Then take a light bulb with a wattage that suits you, dip it into the celluloid solution and Prussian blue that have been stirred evenly, and take it out. After it is air-dried, it can be used.</p>
<p>Children, why not give it a try!</p>

<h3 id="e228">Calligraphy and Painting on Banana Leaf Fans <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>In this extremely hot summer, almost all children are holding a fan in their hands to fan themselves. Among them, I can say that a large part of them are using banana leaf fans because they are not only very cheap and durable, but also the wind is stronger than any other fan. However, it is very difficult to add calligraphy and painting to make it beautiful—because it is easy to fall off—but in fact, it is not. Now there is a very good and simple method to make it beautiful and easy to do. Children may wish to try it!</p>
<p>First, use a piece of straw paper to wipe the banana leaf fan all over! Otherwise, the words cannot be written on it—then you can use a pen to write and draw arbitrarily. After writing, light a wax candle—a kerosene lamp is also fine—and slowly smoke the side of the fan with the words and paintings on it, keeping it about an inch away from the flame. After smoking, wash it with clean water. Then, very beautiful black characters on a white background will appear. If you write a few poems or maxims on it, wouldn't it be elegant? If you write your own name well, you can prevent it from being lost.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Testing the Distance of Thunder <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Little Brother</p>
<p>Children, in the summer, I believe that none of you are not somewhat afraid of thunder. That's right, thunder is a scary thing. However, if we can know that the place where the thunder strikes is still very far from where we are, we don't have to be afraid at all. On the contrary, if it is very close, then we should find a way to hide. Therefore, the most important thing is to know the distance between the place where the thunder strikes and ourselves. The method of testing the distance is very simple: starting from seeing the lightning, immediately put three fingers of your left hand (index finger, middle finger, ring finger) on the root of your right thumb and measure the number of pulse beats until you hear the thunder. Then multiply the measured number of pulse beats by 340, and it can tell you how far the place where the thunder strikes is from you. For example, if you hear the thunder after your pulse beats five times after seeing the lightning, then the place where the thunder strikes is 5×340＝700. Two kilometers outside the meter. (It's still very far, so you don't have to be afraid at all.)</p>
<p>Children, don't you think this calculation method is very strange? In fact, there is nothing strange about it after an explanation. Because the speed of sound is 340 meters per second, and each pulse beat takes about one second. So, always using the above example to buy, the pulse beats five times, which means that the thunder took five seconds to reach your ears. According to the theorem in physics, the speed of sound is 340 meters per second, so the distance that the thunder traveled to your eardrum in five seconds is 5×340＝1700. In other words, the distance between the place where the thunder strikes and you is 1700 meters. This is the principle of the method of testing the distance of thunder.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Homemade Soda <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Defu</p>
<p>The weather is getting hotter day by day, and all kinds of epidemic bacteria are gradually becoming active and starting their deadly work. Therefore, we must pay special attention to everything we eat and drink during this period and be especially clean.</p>
<p>Regarding drinking: Soda is indeed the most hygienic and beneficial to the body, so it is enjoyed by the general public, especially children, who like it very much. Then we should make it ourselves. It can be used as a game to pass the hot summer.</p>
<p>The following is a simple method for making soda:</p>
<p>Materials - 5 parts of sodium bicarbonate, 3 parts of citric acid, 12 taels of clear water. Utensils - one bottle (preferably a used soda bottle), one stopper. Method - First boil the clear water and let it cool completely, then pour it into a soda bottle that can hold twelve taels. Then weigh five parts of sodium bicarbonate, put it in the water bottle, hold the bottle mouth tightly with your palm, and shake it up and down to dissolve it. Then weigh three parts of lemon, add it to the bottle, and then quickly plug the bottle cap. The most important thing to pay attention to is not to let it vent. After this procedure is completed, immediately turn the soda bottle upside down. After a while, the homemade soda will be successful! If we want it to be sweet, we can add a few grains of sugar - ordinary sugar is also fine - if we also want it to be fragrant, we can also add some spices at will, such as banana oil, orange oil... sold on the market - just add a small drop. The last sentence is that before manufacturing, be sure to wash your hands and utensils clean to avoid any bacteria mixing into the soda and causing disease.</p>
<p>Children, if we can do it according to the above method, it will taste as beautiful and delicious as the soda bought on the market. Let's try it.</p>

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>In the year that the blond Hua Le was born, his father passed away. He ascended the throne and became king, which can be considered a small king who had never been seen before. He wore a crown on his head, which was heavy and made his head ache. His sad mother smiled and said that he must learn how to be a wise king. In this way, he had to learn thousands of lessons. Every time ten teachers wanted to put books and arithmetic into his head, he often looked out the window, watching the various changes in the weather. Oh, he was so eager to run outside the door and be in the wind, frost, rain, and snow!</p>
<p>One day, the dark-haired Hua Le was guarding his flock of sheep, sitting on the high hillside, playing the flute, accompanying his loneliness, when suddenly a very large fierce dog came. Hua Le's loyal sheepdog suddenly pricked up its ears and growled lowly in its throat. The fierce dog swept across the ground, and in that instant, the two dogs were wrestling together. Hua Le was startled and used his staff to forcefully separate them, but neither side was willing to give in. Fortunately, four knights whipped their horses and rushed up. It turned out that they were all the little king's guards.</p>
<p>One of the four, the tallest one, opened his mouth and said, "Child, we are here, you have to be careful. If your dog hurts the Lord's beloved dog, it will be bad for you."</p>
<p>The dark-haired Hua Le replied angrily, "It's your dog's fault! It attacked my dog first!"</p>
<p>The man scolded rudely, "Be quiet! The King is here. You impolite child, quickly bow deeply to the King!"</p>
<p>At this time, the blond Hua Le had already ridden his horse over. The dark-haired Hua Le had never seen such a beautiful picture. When he saw the magnificent little king, he was simply surprised and breathless. The little king was wearing a gorgeous blue velvet dress with silver trim, which shone brightly. On his golden-haired head, he wore a glittering golden crown.</p>
<p>The little king said softly, "I am very happy that your dog was not injured. How long have you raised it?"</p>
<h3 id="e233">Firefly Lamp <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhenru</p>
<p>Children, in this summer, there is a kind of lamp that does not cost money and will not burn your fingers. It is very fun to carry, and it is indeed a good toy for children to enjoy the cool in the night. Let me teach you how to make it.</p>
<p>(Materials) (1) One salted duck egg shell, do not cut it open with a knife. Take it and shine it in a bright place. Choose a hollow end, face it against the table, and gently tap it a few times. Then carefully pierce the shell at the broken head. After making a hole, use chopsticks to dig out the egg inside and eat it. Be careful when digging, and dig it clean without breaking the shell. (2) One cotton thread, one foot long is enough. (3) A small piece of white cellophane or white mulberry paper. (4) One-foot-long small bamboo stick. (Utensils) One small pair of scissors, a little paste. After you have prepared all the materials and utensils, you can start making it.</p>
<p>Use scissors to cut the broken head of the egg flat, and then cut the other head flat to form a drum shape (note that when cutting this head, first insert a small hole with the tip of the scissors, then it will be easier to cut), and then insert a small hole in the middle of the egg shell, like a pea, as shown in Figure (1). Then cut off a three-point length from the pointed end of the bamboo strip, tie it firmly with thread, as shown in Figure (2). Pass the thread through the hole in the mountain egg, and then paste the prepared paper on both ends of the egg shell, and then cut a small square of paper, as shown in Figure (3), and pass it through the thread to cover the small hole in the middle of the egg. Then tie the end of the thread to the bamboo stick, so the lamp is successful, as shown in Figure (4). It is best to draw some patterns or national emblems on the paper with colored pens, which will look even better. After the lamp is made, can't you burn candles inside? Without light, isn't it not fun? We made this lamp because we have something special that emits light. This thing was invented by Che Yin, a friend from the Jin Dynasty who studied hard despite his poverty. It is a firefly. You can find it at night in any wilderness where there is grass. We use a fan to catch a few and put them in the lamp, and it is a sparkling lamp, and it flickers, which is very artistic and very fun.</p>
<p>A firefly is a small insect. How can it emit light? Let me tell you, it has a light-emitting organ at its tail. When it breathes, air enters and produces an oxidation reaction, which emits light. It can also help us catch pests in the fields. It is a beneficial insect that greatly benefits our crops.</p>

<p>— Miss Jiang Yixiao Discusses</p>
<p>Nestled serenely and comfortably at the foot of the winding and majestic Jiulong Mountain, by the clear and limpid Furong River, lies a tiny village named "Chenshu," which is my hometown.</p>
<p>I was born in a family within Wuxi, once quite wealthy but later declined and impoverished. My grandfather engaged in commerce after the Taiping Rebellion and accumulated some wealth, acquiring some land and property, making him a relatively prominent figure in the small village. However, my father was a scholar by training and also kind and gentle by nature. Consequently, after inheriting my grandfather's estate, he not only failed to maintain it but also suffered losses in every business venture. By the time I was twelve or thirteen, my family had reached a state of profound gloom and hardship, though outwardly, we tried desperately to maintain a façade of respectability.</p>
<p>With the help of some private savings of my mother's and the enthusiastic assistance of teachers and friends, I progressed from primary school to middle school, from middle school to university, eventually graduating. I wonder how I managed to survive over a decade of arduous and impoverished student life in this money-driven society? Looking back now, it feels somewhat bewildering! And somewhat astonishing!</p>
<p>Before I discuss my career path, I must first speak about the aspirations I held when I entered university. I was very young when I graduated from middle school, with no understanding of the world. My veins coursed with fervent passion, and my mind was filled with wonderful fantasies. Truly, it was an era of not knowing "how high the sky is or how thick the earth is." I always believed that anything I could imagine, I could achieve with courage and effort. In this state of mind, I entered the chemistry department of the science faculty at university. At that time, I held myself in high esteem, even believing, somewhat boastfully, that "in all the world, who but I is capable?" I looked down upon studying liberal arts, researching empty theories, and writing impractical essays, feeling that they could not save China from poverty and weakness. But studying chemistry? I would invent many daily necessities, start factories to manufacture them myself, not only profiting myself but also resisting foreign goods and saving a considerable amount of money flowing out of the country for the nation. After I became wealthy, I could establish many beneficial social enterprises, schools, hospitals, factories, charitable organizations… Such an ideal paradise was built in my then-ethereal and empty mind, making me always very happy and interested in diligently studying chemistry at university for four or five years.</p>
<p>However, after graduation? The elusive reality of society always presented various constraints, preventing me from realizing my ideals. No matter how much I wanted to have a "self-assertive" dream, that dream never came. The pressure of life pushed me into the teaching profession, wielding a writing brush and working as a scribe, and I mostly taught Chinese, with a small amount of mathematics. I spent about ten years in such monotonous seclusion, confined between my desk, chalk, and blackboard, nine years in Tianjin and one year in Beiping. At that time, an atmosphere of gloom enveloped North China, and the surging tide of the South had not yet gathered much momentum. Although I was quite dissatisfied with that rigid life, I could only wait for the right opportunity. Therefore, the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy College and Hongde Middle School temporarily became my places of refuge. However, since I could not invest my hopes in a career, I could only express them in writing. Moreover, this was the motivation for my later career as a journalist.</p>
<p>My earliest writings, scattered pieces on women's issues, were quite numerous, mostly published in the Guowen Zhoubao (National News Weekly), with translations being the majority. This was around 1926. In 1927, I published a single-volume novel, "Lu Jian," which was written in epistolary style, focusing on psychological analysis. Although it was a novel about love, it also contained a noteworthy women's issue. At that time, Mr. He Xinleng, the editor of Guowen Zhoubao, often encouraged me to write, making me more interested in researching and expressing opinions on various social issues. So, around June or July of 1928, when the Northern Expedition succeeded, I officially became a journalist, working for the Tianjin Dagongbao (L’Impartial) as a reporter and editor of local news, and began writing articles on the living conditions of working women in Tianjin.</p>
<p>I am a person full of curiosity. Studying chemistry in school could still provide me with some fresh things to play with, but when I completely wasted my time in the teaching career, it made me feel very painful. Therefore, I suffered a lot mentally and physically. Although I once had a year of illness in Beiping, my body could never be as lively and healthy as when I was studying in school. Only when I started working at Dagongbao, due to the sudden change in life, my spirits were lifted. Just to talk about the investigation of the living conditions of working women in Tianjin, I worked hard for more than a year without slackening. Every day, I ran around on the streets, whether enjoying the warm spring breeze, or baking in the scorching sun and being soaked by the violent summer rain, or accompanied by the rustling leaves and stepping on the cold hail, I always spent my days with great interest all year round. I know myself that I have no constancy in everything, but engaging in this ever-changing life of a journalist is the only hobby I have gained. The only regrettable thing is that my body inevitably needs to be recuperated often! Last year, I followed my mother south from Tianjin and returned to my hometown to rest for a long time. This can also be considered a readjustment to my life.</p>
<p>I have a determination to do things, especially in the news industry, which I am very interested in! I think I am a person with a strong sense of self-confidence, and I like to understand the truth of everything directly and quickly. When I was working as a reporter, I could actually see the opposite lives of the lower-class laborers and the wealthy, and the detailed situation of the inner layer of society. Starting from curiosity, I can make myself not alienated from social life. At least, I can expose reality as much as possible in some opportunities for the reference of those who are responsible for reforming and promoting society.</p>
<p>Invisible chains are tightly binding the women of our country! What exactly is the crux of the women's issue that has been festering for thousands of years? Despite people advocating this movement and that movement, this deeply rooted chain still drags down those who sing high-sounding but impractical tunes. Therefore, in my personal experience, it is necessary to start with investigation and exposure, and only by knowing the root cause of the disease can we prescribe the right medicine. In order to do this willing work, I have not thought about organizing a family so far! Except for the sake of serving and raising a mother, I only promise myself to my reporting work.</p>
<p>In 1934, I published an autobiographical article in Guowen Zhoubao called "Childhood," which was a realistic report of my own family and individual. Recently, I am close to middle age, but I think that reporting the families and individual lives of all women in society is more universal and complete than simply writing about myself, isn't it? Moreover, for myself, it has indeed increased my infinite knowledge and experience in this work.</p>
<p>The "Interviews with Working Women" published in the local news section of Shanghai Dagongbao is continued and reported by me. Some people may think it is too trivial, but it may be welcomed by those who need to know in detail. I am not willing to presumptuously act as someone else's spokesperson, but I am willing to faithfully write out the inner groans of women in various industries!</p>
<p>The life of a reporter is not felt by those who are used to it, but if it suddenly comes, it will often make you at a loss! For example, if you set out to interview someone today, how will you start asking her? How can you grasp the center of her life to ask? How can you make her say as much as possible what she wants to say in a concise way?</p>
<p>Therefore, every time you decide to interview someone, you have to pay attention to some preparations that should be made. In experience, you have to simply record a few questions you want to summarize on paper in advance to avoid omissions. After meeting, if the other party is a person who likes to talk, you may wish to let her talk more. If it is a person who does not talk much, you have to find a way to induce her to talk! Otherwise, the talkative person will often be interrupted by you, and the person who does not like to talk will be silent relative to each other, wouldn't it be boring and tasteless to each other? And the result will be that you will not be able to grasp the key points and have no way to start reporting.</p>
<p>From 1928 to now, I have been engaged in the news industry for seven or eight years. In the daytime, I comb the wind and rain to hunt for information, and at night, I have to bury myself in the editing room to sort out manuscripts. I always have to go to bed at one or two o'clock. But because the complex inner layer of society has a variety of novel things, I will never feel tired and fatigued. When I was tired of living in Tianjin, Dagongbao happened to publish the Shanghai version again, which allowed me to change another environment. Although I only ran in Shanghai society for a few months, I think that the inner layer of Shanghai has at least several years for my research and exploration. In terms of my personality, maybe at that time, I will change another environment automatically.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>There are very few women in our news industry, and most of them are participating in the transaction and editing of a newspaper office, and it is really rare to be engaged in fieldwork. I have not met one in Tianjin or Shanghai!</p>
<p>In my continuous work, I understand that many women's issues are not simply one-sided, it is an important department of the entire social issue. We need the joint efforts of the whole society, especially the deep attention of colleagues in the industry and public opinion, and shout loudly. At the same time, the self-consciousness and efforts of our women's circles are of course extremely important.</p>
<p>"If you don't struggle, you can't survive!" I would like to bless the brave warriors of the women's world with this sentence! I hope we all have the determination to persevere to the end!</p>

<h3 id="e236">Building a New System of Remuneration <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the "Daily Talk" of the Education Daily on July 20th, Mr. Gong discussed "Building a New System of Remuneration." Besides criticizing the current teacher remuneration system for solely relying on empty qualifications ("academic credentials") as a standard, he also suggested a new system of remuneration. This issue has been discussed in the education sector for a long time, but I don't know why the education authorities "fear treatment and conceal their illness" regarding the current teacher remuneration standards.</p>
<p>I remember that during the May Fourth era, a man named Rao Shangda wrote an article called "Breaking Four Superstitions in the Intellectual World." He said that the biggest epidemic in the intellectual atmosphere at that time was: first, superstition of idols (because most people at that time were superstitious of celebrities); second, superstition of temples (because most people at that time were superstitious of the temples where celebrities were located, such as Columbia University, Peking University, Nanjing Higher Normal School, etc.); third, superstition of caves (because people at that time were also superstitious of the caves where the temples were located, such as Paris and London); fourth, superstition of spells (because as long as a person could say a few foreign words, he would be admired). More than twenty years have passed since the article was published, but looking at the situation of superstition of temples in the education sector today, it is still the same as it was twenty years ago, which is really frustrating.</p>
<p>The standards for hiring people and the standards for remuneration in all professions should be judged by the effectiveness of service, which is reasonable. However, relying solely on subjective examination often leads to arbitrary decisions. Although it may not differ too much in general, it is not a scientific method. Where does the so-called "effectiveness of service" differ? There are three necessary conditions:</p>
<p>First is learning. The level of knowledge and the length of ability of each person, in addition to innate wisdom, depends on whether the learning of each person is sufficient. Cultivating knowledge and skills comes from schools and later advanced studies. However, although schools are important places for cultivating knowledge and skills, it is not necessarily the case that entering a certain school can definitely obtain the knowledge and skills that are commensurate with that school. Because the efforts in school vary, just like the starting point of a race is the same, but the finish point will never be the same. Looking at the facts, those who have obtained graduation diplomas still have to go through various examinations, and the reason lies here. However, the learning we are talking about here does not only refer to the academic qualifications experienced in school, and later advanced studies account for the majority of each person's learning. From a practical point of view: the learning from advanced studies, such as the famous scholar Wang Yunwu, is more than twice as high as the students who have no learning and no skills but only have titles. Also, two people from the same school, one constantly studies after leaving school, and the other has neglected learning for a long time, try to think how much the learning of these two people should differ after ten years?</p>
<p>We do not deny that the "effectiveness of service" depends on the quality of each person's learning, but at the same time we also never admit that academic qualifications are the representative of learning, and diplomas can determine the effectiveness of service.</p>
<p>In today's society, especially in the education sector, the standards for determining the remuneration of service providers only see the brilliance of academic qualifications, but ignore the level of actual learning, so that those who are lucky to advance only know the importance of mixing qualifications, but do not know that hard work and advanced studies are more important. Who will be responsible for the formation of this trend, I ask the education administrative authorities?</p>
<p>The second is experience and ability. The size of service efficiency, experience and ability may be more important than learning. Many students who have only studied A+B or vertical line triangles often do not have the technical skills of apprentices. Similarly, for a teacher, how to set up school administration, how to make teaching materials suitable for children's needs, and how to adapt to children's personalities, such as these, a student who has just graduated from a normal school and an old teacher who has been in charge of teaching affairs for many years, due to their experience and experience, the impact on the teaching effect will also be very different. If we despise the valuable experience of old teachers and give them uniform treatment, or even old teachers have rich experience, but because of their academic qualifications—that is, the brand or title—being lower, even if they have excellent service effect, their treatment is still lower than those who have just emerged and have insufficient experience, how can we say that it is fair in terms of reason?</p>
<p>As for ability, its impact on the effectiveness of service is even greater. People who graduate from the same school and do the same job, but the abilities of the two are different. One can plan and control, making the affairs well-organized and achieving remarkable results. The other is weak in ability, has no specific plan before doing things, and has no unifying ability after doing things, and the result is naturally a mess. The so-called ability often comes from talent, which is not like learning that can be remedied by human efforts, but since we are talking about service efficiency, the level of ability of the service provider should naturally be one of the conditions for determining the remuneration standard.</p>
<p>The third is effort. For people who have all three conditions of learning, experience, and ability, if their efforts are insufficient, then the so-called service performance will still not be revealed. There is a story of the tortoise and the hare race that can provide a strong proof. We can say with certainty: those who only have sufficient learning and strong ability, but are not willing to continue with efforts, are the same as those who have no learning, no experience, and no ability. The service effect is still the same low or mediocre.</p>
<p>Overthrow "buying money with empty titles"! Oppose "worshiping temples"! People who do things should show their real skills! People who do things should enjoy the appropriate price for the efficiency they have achieved through their efforts! This is the slogan we have shouted for twenty years. I hope that from now on, all professional circles will set reasonable salary standards and correct the grievances of unequal treatment in the past.</p>
<p>Based on this, I agree with Mr. Gong's ninety suggestions for a new system of remuneration. In fact, starting with a uniform and equal minimum standard of salary for trial use has been seen in some institutions, but I don't know what reason there is for almost all places in the education sector to buy money with empty qualifications? If it is said that it is to improve the qualifications of teachers, then I think it is better to improve learning and reward experience, ability and effort.</p>
<p>Speaking of remuneration, it is not only about salary. All kinds of methods to seek happiness for service providers belong to the meaning of "remuneration". For example, the issue of opportunities for service providers to study and improve, the relationship between working hours and health, the issue of recuperation for illness and old age, the issue of maternity leave for female service providers, ... These are actually problems that we must solve when we directly seek happiness for service providers and indirectly seek progress in service efficiency. However, under the current unreasonable remuneration standard, these are even more felt that it is not worth talking about!</p>

<h3 id="e237">Refrigeration Industry in Shanghai <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Kuang Xinqin</p>
<p>There are two sentences in ancient Chinese books that say: "Families that store ice do not raise cattle and sheep." The meaning of this saying is very interesting! It implicitly praises the wonders of refrigeration. That is to say, families that can afford to store ice can simply place their slaughtered beef and mutton in the refrigerator to keep it fresh as usual, without having to raise livestock. In that pastoral era, because they didn't know how to make machine ice, they could only collect some natural ice blocks in winter to store. They also needed a suitable place, and only fairly wealthy families could afford such extravagance. But now in Shanghai, it is really very convenient. A dozen catties of machine ice only cost a dime or so (natural ice has gradually been eliminated). Why is it so cheap? This is because the refrigeration industry is developed. Moreover, Shanghai can boast that no matter what season it is, fresh vegetables and fruits can be bought all year round. And meat and fish are very difficult to spoil. As a joke, thanks to air-conditioning equipment and antiseptic injections, even the most perishable dead bodies can be kept in Shanghai for a month or two without changing!</p>
<p>Speaking of refrigeration, it makes one think of the "Crystal Palace" of the Dragon King in mythology. This kind of crystal palace-like place can already be seen in Shanghai during the ice factory period; but now, it has gone a step further and become 'you can't see the ice, but it's as cool as a "cold palace".' That is the effect of electric air-conditioning.</p>
<p>There are already many ice factories in Bailianjing and other places in Pudong, Shanghai. Last year, the reporter personally visited them. At that time, a friend from Pudong acted as a guide, and he prepared two wool robes in a suitcase to take with us. Outside the ice factory, the ninety-degree weather made us sweat profusely. As soon as we entered the factory gate, we saw towering ice mountains, and the cool air greeted us, scaring away the heat. When we walked into the middle, we felt like we were in the Guanghan Palace (the moon), and a burst of cold air was overwhelming. The friend had to take out the wool robes, and we quickly put them on, but we still felt unable to resist the cold. It is said that the workers working there all prepare very thick cotton-padded coats before they dare to stay for a long time, otherwise, they will at least suffer from severe typhoid fever.</p>
<p>This year can be regarded as Shanghai's air-conditioning year. Anyone in Shanghai who can get around has probably experienced the taste of air-conditioning, right? Cinemas, theaters, dance halls, grand hotels, and ice parlors all use air-conditioning to attract customers. More sophisticated office buildings and department stores also do so. But here we can only mention the "food aspect" and specifically introduce Shanghai's "refrigeration industry".</p>
<p>According to statistics, there are more than 20 refrigeration enterprises in Shanghai run by both Chinese and Westerners (including cold storage, ice factories, air-conditioning warehouses, companies selling refrigeration equipment, air conditioners, ice machines, etc.), such as Shanghai Air Conditioning Company, Shanghai Clean Storage Company, Dahua Machine Ice Factory, Shanghai Machine Ice Factory, Jardine Matheson Air Conditioning Warehouse, Hongchang Air Conditioning Company, Qiaomao Air Conditioning Company, Qiaolong Machine Ice Factory, Oriental Machine Ice Factory, Maochang Machine Ice Factory, Yongxing Cold Storage Company, Renji Ice Factory, Chengyuanji Ice Factory, Xinya Ice Making Company, China Ice Box Company, Arctic Company, Tiankaida, Schenk &amp; Co., York Trading Company, Melchers &amp; Co., Sulzer Brothers Machinery Company, Lida Company, Haijing Trading Company, etc.</p>
<p>Large-scale cold storage can store as much as ten tons of food such as fish, meat, melons, and fruits. Its interior must be divided into three parts: one is the cold storage, one is the ice-making area, and one is the air-conditioning machine installation area. Large-scale air-conditioning equipment all uses the "indirect air-conditioning method". Electricity is generated by a motor and connected to an air compressor. Usually, liquid ammonia is used as a medium and injected once from the liquid receiver. When the compressor starts to operate, the ammonia enters the expansion coil through the expansion valve, turning into gas, and then is sucked by the compressor and discharged into the condenser. It is cooled with prepared cold water to remove its heat and make it liquid again. After passing through the expansion valve, it evaporates again and becomes a gas, which is used to absorb external heat. This cycle continues, maintaining the minimum temperature of the main equipment's cooling tower, so that the indoor heat can be dissipated to the outside as much as possible. In the specially made air-conditioning box of this machine, there are also fans and cold water sprayed inside, so that cold air continuously comes out. If the equipment is complete, the cooled water can also be made into ice cubes, which can not only increase the effectiveness of the cold storage but also be supplied to the outside world for use. The construction of the cold storage must also be specially made. Usually, ventilation pipes are installed from the ceiling to distribute the cold air throughout the room. Furthermore, ice cubes that have been made but not transported are continuously piled up in all corners of the room. Foods, etc., are mostly placed on iron shelves, some like long bookshelves, some like white iron in ships. Air-conditioning warehouses are simpler because they store non-food items, mostly supplies such as carpets and furs. As for the walls of the cold storage, they are like a large ice box, with cork boards covered in asphalt on the outside, interspersed with roofing felt (those with flat beds are more elaborate, often nickel-plated, and some also have this felt laid inside the roof). The outside is then coated with several layers of airtight and waterproof mixture to make it tight.</p>
<p>Some simple equipment only has an ice-making area, and the made ice is pushed up to surround the refrigerated items. Some places still use natural ice (because it is not eaten, there is no danger), so the cost can be lower. Those who go to refrigerate food and supplies are mostly regular customers. Except for companies like Shanghai Clean Storage Company, which publish price lists in newspapers, the prices in other places are often negotiated face-to-face. Moreover, those large merchants who sell food, vegetables, and fruits are almost all the owners of the cold storage.</p>
<p>As for the restaurants and cold drink shops that can be seen everywhere, they also need to have refrigerators (such as ice boxes, ice cabinets, etc.). Larger and more modern ones use electric refrigerators (for example, the kitchen of the International Hotel uses nearly ten Arctic electric refrigerators). Electric refrigerators can not only refrigerate items but also make ice (they can automatically make ice once every forty-five minutes. Ordinary four-foot ones can make six pounds of ice each time) for use. Older ones use wooden ice boxes, or some even build a small cold storage room with a large amount of natural water.</p>
<p>However, the manager of refrigerated food and supplies is very important! Large-scale air-conditioning projects do have a significant effect on regulating air and dissipating heat, so refrigerated food can stay fresh. But if the management is not proper, it can also make the food taste bland. This is most easily felt with beef and fish because temperatures below zero are the same as temperatures above the boiling point. Freezing it too much is the same as overcooking it, it doesn't taste good. Therefore, the business strategy of restaurants in the hot summer often depends on proper refrigeration to attract customers.</p>
<p>Recently, many catering companies have sprung up in Shanghai. They declare that they can serve those who need all kinds of fresh meat, fish, vegetables, and fruits, and can provide ingredients for dishes, from a few cents to dozens of dollars, large and small, and can be delivered by car in the shortest time. Sophisticated catering companies have small and complete refrigeration equipment in their own prepared vehicles because their business can reach Pudong in the east, Minhang in the south, Baoshan in the north, and Zhenru in the west. Without this kind of mobile cold storage, the food would have spoiled long ago.</p>
<p>Currently, most middle-class and above families in Shanghai also pay much attention to refrigeration and have electric refrigerators, ice boxes, and other equipment. With such cooling, fortunate Shanghainese rarely eat spoiled food.</p>
<p>Biographies of Famous People</p>
<h3 id="e238">British Prime Minister Baldwin <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Mo</p>
<p>Among British politicians, the most famous is probably the current Prime Minister Baldwin. He is the most active and longest-running person on the British stage. He is the current leader of the Conservative Party and has served as Prime Minister—Premier—three times. If you ask a British person: Who is the most famous person in your country, they will surely say Prime Minister Baldwin.</p>
<p>Baldwin is a typical English gentleman. He knows what politeness is. He often shows a pleasant face, expressing a gentle and detached expression, but he is eloquent, quick-witted, and decisive. Therefore, he is most welcomed by the old British gentlemen and capitalists. And he himself is most able to understand the will of these people. He understands that he must speak on behalf of these people in order to come to power in the current situation in Britain.</p>
<p>Stanley Baldwin was born on August 3, 1867, in Bewdley, Worcestershire, England. He came from a wealthy family, so he was able to enter university and receive higher education, and had the knowledge and skills for general social and political activities.</p>
<p>After leaving school, Baldwin worked in the Baldwin company run by his father. But he was very interested in political activities. Thus, in 1908, he was elected as a member of the House of Commons in his hometown. In 1921, he was appointed President of the Board of Trade and became a member of the cabinet. At this time, he had already joined the Conservative Party, and all his efforts were, of course, based on the Conservative Party's position. In October 1922, he overturned the Lloyd George coalition cabinet with a speech. Then, the Conservative Party leader Bonar Law became Prime Minister, and Baldwin jumped to become Chancellor of the Exchequer. The following year, Law retired due to illness, and Baldwin was given the great task of organizing a cabinet and becoming Prime Minister. At this time, his international and even domestic reputation in Britain was not very great, so his appointment to form a cabinet caused quite a surprise. Some British people didn't even know what kind of person he was at all. It is said that at that time, Cambridge University, where he came from, held a parent-teacher conference, and Baldwin also went to participate. At the meeting, he met the scientist Thomson, who had been a classmate for many years. Thus, such an interesting question and answer occurred:</p>
<p>"Your face looks familiar, may I ask your name!" Thomson asked.</p>
<p>"I am Stanley Baldwin," Baldwin said.</p>
<p>"Ah! Yes, I remember! But, Prime Minister Baldwin, what are you doing right now?"</p>
<p>Baldwin couldn't help but smile and replied: "I am the Prime Minister!"</p>
<p>At this point, the scientist Thomson was shocked. He stared at the Prime Minister opposite him, as if he didn't quite believe his ears and eyes.</p>
<p>However, this first Baldwin Conservative Party cabinet collapsed in less than a year. Then, in January 1924, the first Labour Party cabinet in Britain was formed by MacDonald. But in the British general election in October of that year, the Conservative Party defeated the Labour Party again and won a majority of seats in the House of Commons. Thus, Baldwin was appointed to form a cabinet for the second time. At this time, the most important things he did were: first, to build the Singapore naval base to protect the rights of the British Empire in the East; second, to sever relations with the Soviet Union; and third, to sign the Locarno Treaty, attempting to gather European powers to deal with the Soviet Union. These things were, of course, applauded by the general gentlemen of Britain. Therefore, his cabinet gained temporary stability. However, two years later, unfortunately, Britain experienced an unprecedented coal miners' strike, which almost immediately collapsed the Conservative Party cabinet. At this time, Baldwin could only say "God, grant peace," and could be said to be at a loss. By 1929, the result of the general election was that the Conservative Party was defeated by the Labour Party, and Baldwin's second cabinet resigned en masse in June.</p>
<p>In 1931, the British gold standard collapsed, and MacDonald's Labour Party cabinet was on the verge of crisis, submitting its resignation to the British Emperor. At this time, the cunning Baldwin knew the seriousness of the situation and the difficulties of the cabinet, so he decided to help MacDonald and organized the so-called nationally united National Cabinet, with Baldwin as Lord President of the Council. However, this so-called nationally united National Cabinet was actually under the control of the Conservative Party Baldwin. MacDonald was just his puppet. Therefore, at that time, some people said that the National Cabinet was "a cabinet of two prime ministers".</p>
<p>Originally, after the general election in October 1931, the Conservative Party's power expanded, and Baldwin could have come out to form a cabinet, but he, who was experienced in the world, did not immediately come forward. He was determined to let MacDonald continue to do it. By 1935, when MacDonald had been played by him to the point of disrepute, he came out to accept the appointment to form a cabinet and served as Prime Minister. This was Baldwin's third time in power.</p>
<p>This cabinet with Baldwin as Prime Minister was nominally still called the National Cabinet, but in fact, it was entirely controlled by the Conservative Party. Initially, the cabinet lineup was: Simon as Prime Minister, Hoare as Foreign Secretary, and Eden as Minister without Portfolio. But when the Italo-Ethiopian War broke out, Hoare resigned as Foreign Secretary because he advocated being pro-Italian and did not advocate imposing sanctions on Italy, and Eden replaced him. After sanctions were imposed on Italy, because Britain disregarded Hitler's threatening actions against world peace, France could not actively deal with Italy, and Mussolini's aggressive actions in East Africa increased unabated, putting British prestige and the fate of the League of Nations to the most serious test. During this period, the Baldwin cabinet was shaken and almost collapsed. Later, Italy announced the annexation of Abyssinia, and the League of Nations sanctions lost their positive effect. Moreover, some British gentlemen fundamentally opposed the sanctions. Therefore, Baldwin again steered according to the wind, advocating the cancellation of sanctions, the withdrawal of the Mediterranean fleet, and the re-invitation of the pro-Italian Hoare to join the cabinet. Recently, he even canceled the mutual assistance pact on the Mediterranean coast to please Mussolini.</p>
<p>However, in this eventful time in the world, it is really difficult to say how long Baldwin's political life can last. Not to mention anything else, even his son Oliver has opposed his political tendencies, which shows to what extent his credibility in Britain has fallen.</p>
<p>Social Science Lecture</p>
<h3 id="e239">The Origin of the Family <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Guanglu</p>
<p>If the family system is only to indicate the successive blood relationship of a certain group of sexually reproductive individuals, then it can be traced back to a very ancient time. Because even in the most primitive human beings who only constitute wandering groups of twenty or thirty people, we can regard it as the most primitive produced by a certain lineage. It is very clear that intermarriage between different races was prohibited long after the formation of human beings. Not interacting with each other until death and even killing each other were very popular customs among ancient barbarian tribes. Therefore, it can be determined with certainty that the most primitive human beings in a certain group all came from their own lineage and were produced by the same bloodline. However, if family relations are not simply interpreted as blood relations, but as a form and system of individual sexual union between two sexes, and even as a system that constitutes a small individual organization based on sexual relations in a large society, then although the family system must include sexual relations, blood relations, and even be born from these relations itself to become part of its establishment reasons, it cannot simply be regarded as a natural blood relationship and completely confused with the latter.</p>
<p>Looking at the sexual life in the earliest stage of human beings, it was just naturally practicing promiscuity. All women were the wives of all men, and all men were the husbands of all women. Not only were brothers and sisters all husband and wife to each other, but it was also common among parents and children. We can not only get proof from the ancient custom of only knowing the mother but not knowing the father, recognizing that at that time, the mother often had sexual relations with all men, so it was impossible to identify whose son it was. Only the mother who gave birth to and raised him could know. Moreover, McLennan cited the Koryaks of the Bering Strait, the Katak people of Alaska, and the Tinneh people of inland North America as evidence. Letourneau also cited the Cucos of Chile, the Carapies of Indochina, and the Kaso people as evidence. Since in the primitive social forms of human beings, sexual life was unregulated and unrestricted, then in sexual relations, it was only based on natural needs, and there was no customary regulation as a rule. It could not be called any artificial system. Therefore, the family system established based on sexual restrictions and its individual narrow blood system generally did not exist. If we want to call the sexual relations at that time a system, then at most it can only be called promiscuity. This system at most only existed naturally due to the requirements of natural instinct and did not contain the meaning of artificial regulations at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the social and economic life of primitive human beings was completely a shared way of life. At most, they could only reserve certain habitually used tools for production for personal use. Even these things still belonged to the group after death. Because of this, production labor was shared, and the harvest of production was also distributed jointly to all members. Individuals or smaller single groups in the common group could not be differentiated from the larger society, because there was no phenomenon of him or them individually owning any wealth. As a result of this shared social and economic system, that according to the combination of two affections and constituting a small special group according to its bloodline, and independently operating its economic life in a large society, that is, only providing labor to its own small group, and this small group privately owning its labor tools and all harvests, was fundamentally impossible. Therefore, this kind of small group that could independently manage all its own life did not exist and could not exist. That is to say, in the primitive common society, in economic relations, such an independent small individual private unit was not allowed to exist. The family in that sense cannot be said to have appeared in the primitive common society.</p>
<p>From the above reasons, the so-called family system, that is, if based on the independent organization of the small system of sex and bloodline, the organization of private life based on the small independent unit of economy, the general family system could not exist very early. Because at that time, sexual relations were not fixed, and even when children became adults, they were members of the common group, not members of a single family. In economic terms, because it was common, there was no possibility of differentiating from the public economic life and forming a separate economic system. Because of this, the so-called family system, in primitive society, even if we want to say that it has its roots, at most we can only say that the fundamental factors of sexual union and bloodline union on which it is based existed in the society at that time. However, the family system is dynamic, and its changes also change with the changes in social and economic relations. Therefore, if we scrape off the genes of its economic relations and only talk about the origin of the family system from the relationship of sex and blood, then we will not be able to explain anything.</p>
<p>However, there are many scholars who simply explain the origin of the family based on sexual union, believing that absolutely unregulated sexual intercourse never existed in human history. Human beings have always only had polygamy or polyandry, and monogamy is the supreme morality. Therefore, they argue that due to fixed sexual union, the family was already an existing form of human life, and the family system naturally existed from the emergence of human beings. Not only that, but they also seek basis in animals, believing that many birds are loyal to monogamy, and there is also monogamy or polygamy in primates and great apes. Even that kind of absolutely unregulated sexual intercourse among animals belongs to a lower stage. Therefore, it seems that the elements of this family system were established earlier in animals by the restriction of sexual union. Naturally, there is indeed monogamy among birds, but this is simply due to the physiological relationship that the group cannot help during the incubation period. In primates and great apes, not only has that kind of monogamy or polygamy not been proven without contradiction, but also primate apes are animals whose group life is relatively developed. Protecting young apes is no longer just the responsibility of their parents, but the responsibility of their group.</p>
