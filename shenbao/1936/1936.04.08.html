<h3>最近之物品投機市塲</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>我人日前於「上海投機市塲之新轉變」一評略述物品投機之性質及其最近之發展茲以意有未盡請申論之</p>
<p>物品投機具有甚複雜之性質乃投機家最當出以審愼者何則所謂國內重要商品例如棉花小麥之類皆爲農作物其產量之豐歉受制於氣候者匪尠若天氣之晴吾溫度之高低雨量之多寡風蟲災害之有無莫不予以相當之影響且此類作物乃所謂國際的商品其活躍不僅限於國內市塲而國際間之供求消長在價格變遷上所關允巨例如棉市則視美印埃棉產及利物浦工業品市况以爲轉移麥市則幾受美坎澳麥產之控制若昧於世界狀况而盲目投機其不遭犧牲者幾希試以上海麥市爲證「近日國內天氣和暖新麥收成有望且國外洋麥報價亦復連續步小本市粉麥開市近遠期各月份因而一律步落」（見昨日本報商業新聞欄）可見國內外自然環境之左右市塲遠非人力所能控制也</p>
<p>目前物品市塲期貨價格如與現貨相較不免拉提過甚觀於此種現象足知投機因素之强於現貨去胃以棉花而論本月期標花價格與細絨現貨市價相較期貨每擔的高一二元若與粗絨現貨價格相較差額更巨每擔高的三元之譜是以實力空頭均因交貨合算雖經多方一再以收貨爲恫嚇不爲所動傳聞準備於本月份以粗絨棉花交貨者數量巳頗有可觀反之多方之準備收貨者若屬於套利性質自可不成問題但純粹投機者流旣蒙佣金棧租保險虧耗等損失（按前經估計每月每擔的有國幣五角拆息尙不在內）而轉手以現貨出售又須受期現貨價之暗虧至某種粗絨之不易覓得受主者損失更難估計此其風險不啻兩重夫物品之期現價格本屬息息相關若期貨拉提過甚形成腌軌之象則現貨去胃不濃期貨雖抬高於一時自亦不能持久日來標花因受現貨成交有限之影響趨於平疲可爲一例要之物品投機之技巧首在對於物品價値之因素作精密之研究若不問國內外環境如何盲從附和漲則狂拉跌則猛抛殊非適當深望當前之投機商人於此三致意焉</p>

<p>（維也納）小恊商三國政府（捷克·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞）對於奧國所採用之强迫工役兵役制、頃已聯合提出抗議書、內稱、德國於去年三月間廢止凡爾賽和約軍事條欵、恢複徵兵制之後、國聯會行政院卽於四月十七日通過决議案、對於片面違反條的之舉加以貶斥、奧國今將徵兵制度予以恢復、係屬違反聖哲曼條約之片面行爲、小協商各國自當保留權利、採取適當措置、以保障其自國之利益也云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（維也納）小協商各國對於奧國工役兵役制提出抗議之後、此間半官界人士頃加以評論、以爲此乃南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞兩國所發動、捷克政府所持態度則較爲溫和、新自由報載稱、「奧國酷受和平、窮今之世無出其右者、小協商各國抗議之舉、實無理由可言、世人對於奧國、每以獨立國權利為言、但在另一方面、則不許其恢復軍備、此種論調顯屬前後矛盾」云（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英下院　討論外交政策　制裁與和議並進　反對黨力加抨擊</h3>
<p>（倫敦）首相鮑爾溫、因星期三日政府在男女公務員同等俸給問題上之失敗、今日在下院動議、請下院表决、以表示對於政府是否信任、此項動議旋以三六一票對一四五票通過、</p>
<p>反對黨領袖阿特里乃首先攻擊政府之外交政策、而對於意阿爭議事抨擊尤力、謂數年來政府領袖未能稱職、聰令推進力由西方德謨克拉西主義而轉入於狄克推多之掌握中、致戰爭危害日形蔓延、自霍爾與賴伐爾所擬意阿和解辦法被人揭破以來、政府自身缺少信任、意阿戰爭非為意相墨索里尼將否打倒阿皇之問題、但爲侵略國將吾打倒國聯之問題、德國希特勒之廢毀羅卡諾公的而進兵萊茵也、乃國聯失敗之結果、若以羅卡諾公的反抗侵略、則其根據未免太狹、宜集合國聯全部力量、以維持法律與秩序云、</p>
<p>自由黨辛克萊與保守黨邱吉爾皆贊助阿特里之言論、辛克萊訾議政府對於意阿戰爭之政策、主張對於爲侵略之犧牲者予以更堅决之援助、邱吉爾以爲政府政策亳無所獲、旣招與意國疏離、及鼓勵德國作非法行爲之嫌、且未有援助阿國或伸國聯威信之益、此種可悲的史事之敎訓、政府苟非有誠意而具準備實行干涉、至各種必要程度之决心、則不應干涉此種事件云、</p>
<p>外相艾登答辯、謂自雙方已接受調解後、意政府愈加緊其侵略行爲、自英政府觀之、在戰事依然進行之時、日內瓦空言調解、實爲不可忍耐之事、今必須有能在限定時期中終止戰爭之眞正調解、吾則十八國委員會不可不再擔任其工作、至於英政府之地位、始終未變、英政府準備參加經濟與財政之制裁計畫、但須他國擔任以同樣精神實施之耳、</p>
<p>艾登繼言及羅卡諾公的簽字國、卽英法意比四國、所擬舉行之會議、謂英政府不能於參加此種會議時承認調解之絕望、但覺交換意見未始無益、渠贊成應儘先由國聯討論之、蓋希特勒之建議、涉及西方列强以外諸國之事件、故此建議允宜由國聯調整之也、如在夏杪吾人能覩歐洲各國皆爲國聯會員、西歐新構造可代替羅卡諾公的、而他處安全亦因國聯直接監督之布置、得臻穩固、則吾人爲歐洲而獲之安全、亦云多矣、如是吾人方可進行關於經濟與軍備等之更大計畫云、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）次由保守黨極端派領袖邱吉爾起立發言、首述政府與多數黨間、關係不復如前密切、嗣亦對於鮑爾溫首相與內閣、加以攻擊、責其未能阻止侵略國、毋令操必勝之券、謂「今後侵略國所獲酬報、將較賴伐爾、霍爾計劃所畀予者、遠爲有利」、邱吉爾繼又述及意阿爭端對於歐洲時局所發生之影響、謂「吾國曾向法國行使壓力、俾對意國有所行動、惜乎此項行動、未足以援助阿國、徒使意法兩國相乖離、而希特勒遂得利用時機、撕毀條的、並進兵萊茵河區域也」、述及德國要求殖民地平等權利問題、謂內閣務當切實表明立塲、「此際德國境內虐待異族情事、層見迭出、故以委任統治地與殖民地、交予德國之說、自不能成爲問題、（下議員聞言、均歡呼稱善）、抑無論如何、委任統治地與殖民地、吾人决不能以之交予德國、而僅可交予國聯會、蓋各該地方今後命運、惟國聯會始有决定之權也、關於此事、政府務當抱定宗旨、而明白宣布之」、至是、邱吉爾述及德國派兵進駐萊茵河一事、謂今茲德國當在昆連法國地方、迅速建造强固防禦工事、自無疑義、惟此舉將在外交形勢與戰略上發生何種後果乎、就余觀察、德國在法國邊界對面完成防禦工事之後、則萊茵河岸、祗需駐守少數軍隊、於事已足、而其大軍卽可從容北指以進窺比國荷蘭、此層殊爲可慮也、此際英法比三國參謀部、行將舉行談話、此其意義、當係英國業與法比兩國聯絡一致、若遇兩國未經挑釁、而被侵略之時、英國自必實踐互助之諾言、卽使因此發生戰事、亦所不顧也」、（少數議員聞言歡呼）云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）財相張伯倫今日在下院答邱吉爾關於德國要求收回殖民地事之問話、謂德國縱有此要求、英國必不放棄其現有之任何領土或代管地、據渠所知、從未有人建議英國應放棄其一部份領土者、英國亦决不能接受此種要求、當支配代管權時、並未作代管權可以更易之想、渠以爲管權之轉移、至少須所代管者與國聯行政院之同意而後可、殖民大臣湯姆士所發英政府並未考慮亦不欲考廬交還任何領土或代管地事之言諭、已使英政府之地位完全明晰、渠雖未爲未來之政府擔保、但渠覺無論他國所有之代管地命運如何、英國任何政府决不致討論轉移其自己代管地之問題、政府承認對於其所代管土地之人民負有切實之義務、苟非確知該土地內全部人民之利益獲有完全保障、政府未便作將此土地交與他國之想、縱爲獲取全部和平解决起見、亦不能出此也云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>首相鮑爾溫今日提出其動議時、略謂公務員不分男女俸給同等之議、係工黨議員威金森女土所提出、四月一日下院以一五六對一四八票通過之、此議未嘗不佳、但時機今尙未成熟、現有一種感想、遍及國內、以爲男子失業久數之多、乃女子奪其職業所致、渠估計同等俸給之議將每年增加支出三百萬鎊、渠以威金森女士之提議、將使錄用女子之便利不能增多但反受妨碍云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下議院昨晚討論「女性公務員薪俸案」、當卽投票表决、內閣所獲得之多數、僅二一六票、較之平時恒在二五〇票上下者、巳見减少、此案雖與外交政策無關、但反對派各議員故意涉及外交問題、而以第一流之重要性、畀諸此决辯論、當時左右兩派議員、對於內閣現行外交政策、多猛烈加以抨擊、各觀察家以爲此實出乎內閣意料之外、例如保守黨極右派議員、前海相邱吉爾、竟與獨立工黨議員瑪克斯頓、持同樣語調、卽保守黨前外相奧斯丁張伯倫爵土、亦就內閣現行政策各主要點、要求加以說明、外相艾登乃不得不變更預定程序、起而發表意見、（依預定程序、原當由財相張伯倫結束辯論）、此决辯論最可注目之點、乃意阿爭端、突又成爲第一流問題、昨日下院空氣、異常緊張、實與本年初間討論情形不同、近日阿國北路軍事、節節失利、消息傳至此間、下院因而爲之激烈、反對派各議員認爲阿軍失敗、係由於英國政府對於制裁政策、過於軟弱所致、此在政府派各議員、則自前外相霍爾、前因意阿爭端之議和案夭折、提出辭職之後、對於內閣所行外交政策、卽已不無懷疑、此種懷疑態度、今又因之加重矣云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>瑪德里　西班牙國會、定於明日解决柴摩拉總統之蟬聯問題、預料國會對於總統解散上屆國會一舉、將予以核准、因選舉結果、左翼勝利右翼失敗、可知上屆國會不解散、實不足以代表民意也、唯國會若不贊許此事、則柴摩拉必自動退職、而由議長巴里奧代理、就現勢觀察、社會黨决計對於總統提出彈劾案以推倒之、依照憲法第八十八條之規定、若能獲得國會議員五分三或一六三人之贊助、卽能成立、唯社會黨於國會中能吾號召此數、不無問題、但聞總統方面現擬不待國會發動而考慮先行辭職之問題矣、（六日國民社電）</p>

<p>各輪在汕開行時、該兩公司必派職員下輸、點查客票、照章小童半價、有稍高者、則被迫購全價、如不補足、則被逐登岸、何以此决貴陽輪匿藏客至四百餘名之多、夏樂土輸匿藏一百八十餘人、亞睦輸匿藏至二十四人、該總理職員點客、全無所聞、是串通舞弊無疑、</p>

<h3>法西主義的社會基礎（中）</h3>
<p>— Joseph　Barnes作　不忍譯</p>
<p>固然，這小資產階級對於託辣斯資本的箝制會經組織過間歇的反抗。它曾經攻擊過組合企業，正和一百年前英國破壞黨工人的暴動相同。它曾經在不同型式的人民黨旗幟之下組織過各種的政治革命。湯麥士·傑弗遜的社會與經濟哲學——這大槪是代表小資產階級的最圓滿而合於公式的政治的表白——從來不曾從美國人的生活脫離過。美國的反獨占運動，和它的「打倒託辣斯」的口號，反對運銷商店的法律，法官勃蘭地斯所代表的政治傳統及「咒咀大資本家」的成語，以及合作運動等等，都足以證明這傳翁的力量。</p>
<p>可是，這是値得表明的，在它打倒了封建制度以後，明確的成功就很少了。在「櫻桃園」購置產業的市鎭商人，在他尙未把木材直接出賣的時候，巳被在加里略的木材企業排斥了。趨向於統一，託辣斯化及貨物的大規模生產與大規模分配的機械時代的巨大的壓力，摧殘着中等階級的原來利益，有如它催殘它的領袖們所傳播的經濟的與社會的原則。</p>
<p>這命運一直依附着所謂中等階級的本身結構。它企圖構成一個合理可行的制度的努力，從開頭就受事實的阻礙了。這事實就是：它的性質旣不和托辣斯資產階級相同，也不和無產階級相同。它是各式各樣的分子的混合物，有些竟顯然是相互衝突的。</p>
<p>結果之一就是最近八十年來，中等階級在托辣斯資本與無產階級之間演着從中調停的困難角色。這角色，過去歐洲封建制度的地主階級成功地扮演過幾年。俾士麥的經濟法律，和俄國的斯多里本的經濟法律相同，是封建貴族的餘黨用以抑制暴發戶資本家階級的侵掠野心的巧計。羅斯福總統，要是他代表美國弱小的地主貴族罷，那就可以　是處着同樣的地位。可是，我們如果把復與計畫的大部分看做美國小資產階級一方對有組織的勞工，另一方對貪婪的財政資本主義的防禦的努力，却合理得多。</p>
<p>直到如今，中等階級在民主工業國家只有保持自己這一點是成功着。除此以外，它就沒有什麼成功了。在美國，和在西歐相同，註定的佳運偏向於託辣斯獨占者方面。財政的和產業的集中，只有進步而沒有退步。亞當·斯密士所假定的在公開市塲的自由競爭，經過了兩百多年，仍然不過是一個假定而巳。</p>
<p>這是爲明瞭西歐法西斯團體的勃興起見必須認識的社會背景。無論在意國或在德國，尤其在法西主義得勢以前，法西主義者是明白地而且直接地給中等階級呼籲的。他們咒咀在莫斯科領導下的工會，咒咀「國際的」，「猶太的」，或「大範圍」的資本。墨索里尼的黑衫黨員發見他們的最早和最大的力量是在半島的中部，是在南部與北部工業區域的農民中間，是在小資產階級與佃農佔着優勢的地域——這些地方的意大利人是受了傳統與物質興味的東縛而形成中等階級的。在德國，悄形亦正相同。這階級的各個「被遺忘的人」型式的個人，無論是都會的或鄉村的，天主敎的或新敎的，把慕索里尼與希特勒送到有權力的地位。</p>
<p>權力旣得，被遺忘的人又被遺忘了。在意大利，「資本主義時代的末期」，仍然常見於演詞中，但中等階級在國富分配或收入方面的相對地位仍然沒有多大改變，而大企業一直繼續發展着。一九三三年以前，國社黨員會在柏林搗破百貨商店的窗門；但從一九三三年以來，沒有特定的法律來帮助小商人抵制他的大競敵。國社主義下的中等階級運動已被它的領袖們停止了，因爲這運動變成了使他們不快的原因。</p>
<p>法西主義起先給中等階級呼籲而獲得了權力，後來便把道權力用在大範圍的獨占利益上面了。法西主義所具有的這矛盾性，是有兩種大不相同的解釋的。一種是法西主義者自己的解釋。另一種是社會主義者的解釋。</p>
<p>從法西主義者看來，法西斯國家和私人企業的聯繫只是大概念中的一部分。這就是社團國家。它楚賦予全部神聖的國家觀念超越個人與團體的利益的一個實體。它含有犧牲的感情的要求，在這方面它明白承認爲國家而暫時忍痛受苦的需要。此外，它更含有遠期的勸獎的要求，在這方面它預的着勝過初期犧牲的報償的國家勝利的光榮。在意國，這社團國家的慘澹經營是被認爲一種試騐的；組織社團要使各別的羣衆利益和平地融合起來，只是新近的事。同情的作家這樣解釋過：「各社會階級在生產過程的各別的分擔，不但應由他們各別的力量來决定，而且應由以相互諒解與公正平等的原則爲基礎的協和來决定。這就是法西斯蒂的理想。」</p>

<h3>三色輪船失火　滬行電詢眞相</h3>
<p>本埠天祥洋行所經理維廉巴勃輪公司、在紐約遠東綫內、新建有太字號輪各艘、即太平·太平洋·太陰·及太陽號是也、各輪爲特快班、上海至紐的、渡太平洋、通巴拿馬、共祗三十七日、在上海爲最速之輪、故營業至佳、每四星期開一班、此决本爲太陰輸之班期、特因人塢大修、乃由該行改派脫里克臘號輪Tricolor第一次來華航行、上海於三月二十三日開出、</p>
<p>運貨至夥</p>
<p>脫里克臘號原航大西洋、船身至佳、速度又强、且有客位、今回由遠東返美、裝去貨物甚多、本有一萬一千七百噸、旋以本埠七百噸桐油缺貨、無法裝輪、故連同小呂宋·香港·上海·及日本各埠、共運一萬一千噸出口貨、木材·棕繩·棉花·絲頭·羊毛等均有、而該輪巳滿載各艙矣、至旅客以呂宋下船者居多、上海僅兩人、</p>
<p>失火原因</p>
<p>本報記者昨至天祥洋行叩詢其負責人、據稱、白脫里克臘號開出後、滬上並未接得電報、蓋沿途至安也、直至昨日、該行閱報始知此輪被燒、然行中尙無來電、殆因距滬遠、離美近、此訊故未發來上海也、推火燒之起因、料從棉花中發生、蓋火燒處適爲第五艙、該艙裝棉花、而火從第五艙起、棉花最易着火也、</p>
<p>滬貨全損</p>
<p>上海去貨、均裝第五艙與艙面、自首當其衝、據昨日滬上得到可靠訊、五百件棉花巳燒去一百五十件、（其餘三百五十件、恐亦難保、）羊毛一百三十七件、核桃四百件、絲頭三十件、猪鬃十七件、其他雜貨數十件、蓋一經着火、頓成燎原、星星熊熊、盡爲焦土、損失之重大、要不可以數計矣、</p>
<p>探詢究竟</p>
<p>失火地點、據傳在離開日本橫濱約一千海裏、而尙未到檀香山、現船身將在太平洋北部海邊擱淺、天祥昨巳電美、探詢究竟、該輪原定來華航行兩班、第二班定八月二十一日由滬開出、今則將另行派船矣、船主爲挪威人、名托夫脫、Capt　Taft尙係新從香港調上該輸云、</p>
<p>國民新聞社六日舊余山電、上星期六、德國巴伯戚廉綫之三色號汽船失慎後、其搭客十三人、巳皆乘救生船運赴他船、唯其中尙有水手四十五名、現正竭力救火、唯火勢日熾、該船現在中程島西北五百英哩之洋面、力謀抵達檀香山、唯據大來公司之葛朗總統號來電、以該船火勢猛烈、航行甚緩云、</p>
<h3>川河水漲通輪　上海直航重慶</h3>
<p>今日開始運貨　共有三輪上水</p>
<p>川河航路、本年水淺、在宜昌地方、最淺地水勢、除底位外、僅餘一寸、以致航行川河之中英意法日各國商輪、盡行停航、嗣後水勢雖略漲、但仍祇可航行淺水之客輪、而不能載貨通過宜昌、在事實上川河貨運、迄未通行、直至本月四日、三北公司始得宜昌來電、川河水已增漲、最高處有二尺八寸至三尺以上、（除底位外、預計本月六日、可以載貨通過宜昌以上之淺處、）怡和日淸等亦各得漲水之訊、因此急調嘉和輪·（怡和）長陽丸·（日淸）聚福公司亦派福源輪、於今日各裝運川貨物、從上海直放重慶、此為川河水淺斷航以來之上海第一次開行滬渝直運輸而滿裝入川貨件也、</p>

<h3>貸款會及錢業　準備穩渡四底難關　中央交三行將擴充同業拆放　錢業公會定期舉行內盤會議</h3>
<p>實業社云、滬市工商業每年必經之四底·五底·十底·年終、四期結賬、爲全市金融緊急之非常時期、今距四底不及三週、各業大半已在籌劃充分準備、據記者探悉、各銀行錢莊因近來業務發展、多數可沾盈餘、蠶絲橡膠雖受滯銷影響、但獲利尙厚、綢緞茶業、因市面籌碼增加、金融活動、頗可樂觀、紗花米麥麵粉雜糧棉布等業、因去年各地農村大熟、民問購買力增强、銷路逐漸暢旺、進出口業及各商行、以五金礦砂顔料等盈餘爲最多、其他各商品亦呈昭蘇之象、對於四底難關、可望穩渡、</p>
<p>委會盡量放欵</p>
<p>上海市工商業貸欵委員會、因去年財政部准各業領袖之請求、分令各銀行認定四百七十五萬、錢業各莊認定二十五萬、共為五百萬元、聘定各業鉅子於四底以前組織成立後、卽遵令辦理各業信用小放欵、以資週轉、迄至本年上月底、已貸出一百七十餘萬元、工作順利、成績斐然、茲該會鑒於去年四底滬市曾發生金融風潮、今爲力謀澈底救濟市面起見、特决定於本年四底前、准予儘量放欵、以期扶助工商、增進工作效能、聞日來各業向該會申請放欵者、較以往驟形踴躍、該會最近卽將開會審查核准貸欵、此後市面金融、可期鬆動、</p>
<p>擴充拆放透支</p>
<p>本市中央中國交通等三銀行、自於去年各業總結賬時、集中二千萬元、舉辦同業拆放後、金融事業、獲益匪淺、茲因工商業四底將屆，、爰特酌量擴充該項拆放業務、協維未來嚴重工作難關、至於其他銀行方面、除提早加緊凖備工作、鞏固自身基礎外、並已積極辦理往來信用透支放欵、藉以救濟市面、對於各項抵押及貨物放欵、亦經决定相當計劃、</p>
<p>錢業將議內盤</p>
<p>錢業同業公會所屬四十九家會員莊鑒於自去年四底、一度發生風潮後、對於自身準備、均依照錢業監理會之指示、具有深切之戒心、今年四底、可不致有何問題、昨據實業社記者向錢業方面探悉、各莊對於四底、業經準備充實、一切往來長期放欵、凡對方信用卓著者、在可能範圍內、准予通融給息展期、四底之「內盤」會議、定於本月二十五日召開執行委員會時、同時舉行、日來各莊收解、尙未十分繁忙、昨日錢業市塲上、下午洋拆、行情、因各方需要不多、故仍平定爲八分、卽每千元每日利息八分、聞此後洋拆、當有步漲趨勢云、</p>
<h3>國際貿易局　促進國際貿易</h3>

<h3>郵儲局吸收儲金　决定三原則</h3>
<p>以安全流動厚利兼施並進　國民儲金數巳達五千萬元</p>
<p>大公社云、郵政備余創辦於民國八年、當時係由郵局兼辦、民十九年時、制度略有變更、由交將儲金匯兌兩部份劃出、設立郵政儲金滙業局、專責辦理儲金滙兌業務、歷年以來、國民鑒於斯項儲蓄之輩固、信用之可靠、且係國家經營、非與普通商業儲蓄銀行可比、故儲戶逐年增加、其儲金限額以一元起、即可開戶、最高額、私人限定三千元、團體限定四千元、全國七百餘郵區、辦理儲金、該局最近統計儲戶、計二十萬以上、儲金總數達五千餘萬元、</p>
<p>投資三原則</p>
<p>據儲金處長張梁伍談、郵政儲金創辦迄今、巳經過不少年月、具有相當之歷史、因限制儲金額數、故存欵僅達五千餘萬、蓋以鑒於大儲戶之存欵、時存時提、宗旨非爲儲蓄性質、郵政不能利用其資金、寢假而妨害小儲戶利益、過去一般商業銀行、形成經濟擱淺者、受大存戶之影響者居多、郵政儲金如不加以限制儲額、儘量收受、目前為止、可達幾萬萬之儲金也、所以郵政儲蓄、與商業儲蓄者、業務不同之點在此、目郵政儲金、運用資金、與信用可靠之投資、保障儲戶之利益、其目的在於獎勵儲蓄、是故本局最近對於儲金投資方式、决定原則如下、　安全可靠、　資金流動、　利息優厚、本三大原則、兼施並進、不作投資事業、保證郵政儲蓄之利益、扶助國民經濟之繁榮、此爲本局所負使命與資任也云云、</p>

<h3>上海節育會　昨請馬丁夫人演講　全球足養五十億人現已有半數人口　科學昌明戰爭消滅非節制生育不可</h3>
<p>英國提倡節育專家馬丁夫人、於本月五日到滬後、昨日下午五時半、應上海節育會之請、在靜安寺路九九九號上海女靑年會、作初度演講、講題爲「人口問題與節制生育、」時適雷雨、但到中外男女聽衆、仍達百餘人、劉王立明主席、茲分誌各情如决、</p>
<p>滬節育會過去工作</p>
<p>主席劉王立明首先起立介紹、略謂、此次演講會、為上海節育會之初次公開演講、上海節育會、成立巳十年、其動機、對國家造成優良民族、建立快樂家庭、實現光明社會、對父母减輕經濟負擔、减少疾病苦痛、减除多兒煩惱、對兒童使有康健身體·優美生活·週到撫育·爲一偉大之人道運動、十年中、的可分爲二階段、上半段係顔福慶醫生等所發起、側重硏究工作二年前在美國硏究節制生育問題之周鍾慧卿返國、爲同情本會工作、自動加入恊助、故本會工作、乃由研究階段、而達於實施階段、經本會努力結果、已成立節育珍所三處　在愛文義路廣仁醫院、　在西門婦孺翳院、　在海格路中國紅十字會醫院、以便欲節育者之詢問、或指導、又因過去節制生育、幾爲上中社會所特享、現會中巳向各平民新村·及人力車夫公會·等平民社會宜傳指導、俾能普遍云云、繼即介紹馬丁夫人演講、謂夫人此次東來、在印度演講四十五决、廣東六次、香港多决、對節制生育、有特殊研究云、</p>
<p>演講開始注重生產</p>
<p>繼由馬丁夫人演講、謂今日講題、爲「人口問題與節制生育、」目下世界各國、均正注意人口問題、雖然、若干國家領袖、獨在鼓勵生育、且據英美專家研究結果、現全球尙足的五十萬萬人生養、故似尙爲不甚重要問題、但無論何國、如不能予人民以生活上之安適、即應提倡節制生育、提倡生育者、實應視生產者之能力而定、</p>
<p>生產應視經濟情形</p>
<p>「節制生育」、於一九一四年、爲美國山額夫人所提倡、因爲一新名詞、但實爲一老問題、吾人如以歷史眼光觀之、則自古夫婦、即以多子女爲累、當時雖即有節育方法、但甚殘酷、今則科舉昌明、巳無問題、節育意義、非「不欲子女」、而爲「依吾人之需要而生產、」即吾人之經濟情形、可生產撫養若干子女、即生產若干、節制生育、更非墮胎、就生理上論之、墮胎在巳成胎後、節制生育、則在成胎以前、故無罪惡可言、</p>
<p>理想中之結婚問題</p>
<p>今日余僅自家庭人口問題談起、結婚並非以生兒育女爲目的、蓋靑年男女、因事業情愛等而欲作永久之朋友、婚後、生一孩、甚喜、第二孩出世、亦尙歡欣、二三年後、再生一孩、雖尙喜歡、但巳嫌辛勞、年復一年、而快樂美麗之少女、巳一變而爲老母矣、吾人理想中之結婚、靑年在結婚以前、應經醫生檢騐、是項工作、甚屬重要、蓋以判斷彼等有無爲父母之資格、誠如在戰爭時、測騐士兵有無戰鬥力相同、如某女性在婚後巳生一孩、即往節育指導所詢問所得不淺、因一經指導、　可不再恐懼第二孩子續生、　可使第一孩得受善良之撫養嬰兒、在最初之一二年間、所受母親之親自撫養、實將大有裨益於其一生、夭折兒童、第二孩較其弟妹爲少、可爲一證、</p>
<p>節育可使婦女休養</p>
<p>在生理及醫學上、婦女在生產之後、應有相當時間之休養、然反對節制生育者謂、在此相當休養時間中、可使夫婦中止兩性生活、惟據英國某著名醫生謂、此舉實足破壞夫婦關係、不如節制生育之爲得、某一家庭需要若干子女、應以經濟情形爲定、又有反對者言、兒童乃國家所有、不論多寡、生產後統可由國家撫養、但當此社會制度未改革前、正有千萬兒童、宛轉呻吟於苦痛之饑寒生活中也、</p>
<p>節育能產優良兒童</p>
<p>過去、父母常視兒女爲私產、希望於老年時享受其奉養、甚且爲促其夢想之早日實現、使未成年兒童即入工廠作工、以贍家用、此事巳引起若干國家之注意、予以限止、浸且此項觀念漸呈淡薄、節制生育運動、實不僅在使多兒者加以節制、亦可使無兒者、因受節育指導、而知如何能生產優良兒童、今後生產孩童、將先選擇其父母、如父母身體不健康、彼等即可謝絕生產、叉如其父母無充分衣食供給、亦可退避三舍、（幽默大師蕭伯納曾言、「在倫敦東端有花園而無兒童、西端有兒童而無花園、」此後有花園者、亦可有兒童矣、）再如其父母如無敎育機會、給予兒童、亦可不生產、如英國現有二百萬人失業、其子女即鮮有受敎育之機會、故節育者、須其父母有工作後、始再生產、蓋節制生育論者、即爲未能發表其意見之兒童之代言人也、</p>
<p>節育應由醫生指導</p>
<p>至於節制生育之將來、則醫生可爲衆人指導節育方法、每一醫學院中、必有節育學識加入課程、以爲學生他日懸壺時之用、至於窮苦者、亦可得免費機會、故節育者非僅閱讀報紙論文記載即可解决、必需就詢醫院、市上節制生育藥品甚多、若未經醫生承認而購用、不僅經濟受損失、且於身體有妨害、希望上海人士勿受其愚、又反對節制生育者常言、一旦節制生育運動普遍後、道德將極度墮落、但靑年若能有相當性敎育及衛生常識、且可提高道德、</p>
<p>節育解决人口問題</p>
<p>吾人若不節制生育、一任子子孫孫、繁衍無極、則千年後、固尙無若何變化、一百萬年後、其增加數量、將至足驚人、宇宙中原有一種自然人口限止、如饑荒·疫癘·戰爭·及嬰孩殺戮等、十四世紀時候歐洲人口死於　　病者、幾達半數、上决大戰中、有十萬男兒、死於疆場、使十萬女子失其結婚對象、使數千萬兒童不能生產、現在醫學進步、疾病困苦、巳無問題、國際聯盟、又正謀國際間之和平、以消滅戰爭、如世界一旦眞無疾病及戰爭等、則解决人口問題、舍節制生育外、實無他方法、</p>
<p>英印死亡率之比較</p>
<p>英印在同一政府統治下、六十年前、英國生產率與印度相若、而印度則嬰孩死亡率較高、兩地均有公民敎育、現在英國生活程度提高、生活快樂、印度反是、不同者、英人能節育、印度則吾、目下英印嬰孩死亡率、一千人中、英五十七人、印二百人、產婦死亡率、一千人中、英四人、印二十人、兒童夭折者、一千人中、英五人、印二十五人、</p>
<p>希望聽衆予以同情</p>
<p>最後馬丁夫人希望聽衆能對彼演說同情、推行節制生育、使家庭快樂幸福、推而廣之、以達一般社會及國家、消滅戰爭，再由各國推而至全世界、使全世界普遍生長優良健强而有敎育之國民、</p>
<p>將再請作政治演講</p>
<p>馬丁夫人、不僅爲一節制生專家、亦為英國婦女運動領袖、曾因參政運動入獄、故上海婦女界、將請彼再作一度政治演講云、</p>

<h3>我國收音機進口　年在二百萬金單位　全國現有廣播電台八十九座　滬市收音機約在十萬架以上</h3>
<p>比年以來、我國廣播無綫電台事業、突飛猛進、大有一日千里之勢、總計全國現有廣播無綫電台八十九座、近三年來、無綫電收音機及零件之進口、每年約在二百萬金單位左右、漏　之鉅、殊堪驚人、茲探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>我國電台發軔</p>
<p>我國廣播無綫電台之發軔、始於民國十一年時、有美商在滬創辦中國無綫電公司、以五十瓦特電台播音、嗣以發音不佳、未幾停辦、迨至民國十三年、開洛公司設支行於上海、並設一百瓦特之廣播無綫電台、播送西樂唱片、十六年新新公司裝置五十瓦特之播音台、報告商情及時事新聞、兼插入中藥及中國唱片、嗣後天津·北平·浙江·昆明·漢口·南　·福州·廣州·南昌行營·山東省會·河北·等各省市電台、相繼成立、其中最大者、厥推中央電台、總計全國現有廣播無綫電台八十九座、（東北四省除外）分佈江·浙·魯·豫·皖·鄂·川·贛·閩·粵·滇·桂·等省、</p>
<p>滬市電台統計</p>
<p>本市廣播電台、除市政府電台外、幾全係私營、播音節目、側重於廣告及娛樂、（福音佛音二家宣傳宗敎）各台電力最高六百瓦特、最低三十瓦特、茲錄其名稱電力如下、華泰四五、華美西人六〇〇、東陸一〇〇、華僑五〇〇、東陸一〇〇、同樂五〇、大陸一〇〇、建華一〇〇、周協記七五、亞東一〇〇、新新五〇、敦本一〇〇、奇開三〇、福音一五〇、安定五〇、友聯一〇〇、富星一〇〇、李樹德堂一〇〇、明遠一〇〇、佛音五〇〇、東方一〇〇、中西一〇〇、華美一〇〇、上海一〇〇、元昌五〇、亞聲二〇〇、中研一〇〇、大中華一〇〇、航業一〇〇、國華一〇〇、利利一〇〇、華　一〇〇、交部五〇〇、市音一〇〇、華東二〇〇、惠　五〇、新聲五〇、法人一〇〇、鶴鳴三〇、其美二五〇、華光二〇〇、市政府五〇〇、</p>
<p>收音機之估計</p>
<p>無綫電台所播之音樂、藉收音機以收聽、故無綫電收音機數量之增加、與年俱進、我國無綫電收音機數字、因乏可靠統計、故其確數、尙乏確切之估計、據最近國際電信局無綫電收音機登記處發表已登記之收音機、共計六萬三千餘架（其中一部份登記後轉運內地）、但實際上收音機用戶之未登記者、為數甚眾、據一般估計、全上海之收音機總數、約在十萬架以上、</p>
<p>日貨進口最鉅</p>
<p>市面上通行之收音機、十九屬舶來品、每架價格、少則數十元、多至數百元、燈泡愈多、價格愈貴、普通自四燈至七燈、其裝有十一二燈者、則非數百元不可、利權外溢、漏　甚鉅、最近三年來、我國無綫電話機及零件之進口、始終盤旋在二百萬金單位左右、內中美國貨增减互見、英國出品、逐年迭减、德國貨則年有增加、惟日本貨、增加最速、至於國產無綫電收音機、尙在萌芽時代、　以成本昂貴、銷路遲鈍、出貨至為稀少、</p>

<h3>中國保險股份有限公司營業報告書</h3>
<p>自民國二十四年一月一日起、迄十二月三十一日止、為本公司營業之第四年度、業經决算帳目、製成各項表單、茲將經過狀况、　列如後、謹請公鑒</p>
<p>火險營業狀况</p>
<p>本届火險保費收入毛數、除國外特約同業公司分保撥來分保費不計外、計國幣九十五萬九千四百六十三元七角三分、較諸上屆收入毛數、計國幣八十一萬六千一百五十四元七角二分、顯有增加、保費收入凈數、除撥付分保費外、較諸上屆收入國幣十六萬九千三百九十七元七角二分、本屆已增至國幣四十萬另一千三百另七元六角一分、賠欵之已付未付者、合計國幣十七萬三千七百五十一元三角五分、計佔保費凈數百分之四三·三〇、營業開支、計國幣十萬另五千九百七十三元九角正、約佔保費凈數百分之二六·四一、佣金項下、收支互抵、計餘國幣六萬六千七百三十二元三角六分、此外加以上屆結存準備金項下所生之利息、計本屆火險部份、共獲盈餘國幣十萬另五千九百三十八元七角二分、而上屆盈餘、則為國幣十二萬七千一百五十八元一角四分、至火險準備金一項、除照例提存百分之四十外、再自火險盈餘內、提撥國幣八萬元、以厚實力、如是火險盈餘項下、尙餘國幣二萬五千九百三十八元七角二分、撥入總損益帳、本屆營業、春夏兩季、因各地堆存貨物减少之故、退保費特多、幸入秋以來、貿易狀况、漸有起色、業務遂亦較為繁榮、故桑榆之收、猶覺未晚、初冬之際、國際局勢緊張、兵險業務、陡形頻繁、迨至年終、形勢和緩、始復常態、</p>
<p>水險及雜險營業概况</p>
<p>本屆水險保費收入毛數、較諸上屆收入國幣十四萬六千二百九十八元九角五分、本屆已增至國幣三十八萬九千七百十六元七角三分、保費收入凈數、除撥付分保費外、計國幣六萬另六百七十元另六角四分、賠欵之已付未付者、共計國幣一萬七千二百另七元二角一分、水險業務範圍、仍限於國內貨物及生金銀之運輪為大宗、至準備金一項、亦按向例照淨收保費百分之二十提存之、</p>
<p>汽車險營業、在本公司各項營業數量中、雖僅佔小部份、計收入保費國幣一萬一千九百二十八元九角八分、而付出賠欵、祗有國幣三千另二十元另另九分、有此成績、尙堪告慰、水險及雜險中、有數種保險、保期甚短、故至年終、均經滿期、已無未了責任、因之無提存準備金之必要、本公司本屆營業範圍、日益擴充、如電梯險·玻璃險·意外險·等、均經先後舉辦、惟此項業務、明知日後雖期發達、然為顧客便利、計不論種類繁瑣、莫不慇懃接受、以副保戶之雅意焉、</p>
<p>本屆水險及雜險盈餘國幣三萬六千三百五十五元正、較諸上屆祗有國幣九千六百三十元另一角七分、亦見生色、該項盈餘、除提出國幣二萬元、以作準備金外、尙餘國幣一萬六千三百五十五元正、撥入總損益帳、</p>
<p>人壽險營業概况</p>
<p>人壽險營業之消長、為國民經濟榮枯之反映、高利貸之繼續存在、自由礙於人壽險之進展、從利率有逐漸低落之可能、顧欲謀人壽險業務之推進、仍非努力工作不為功、</p>
<p>本屆人壽險新保額、計達國幣一百六十八萬另二百二十四元另六分、較諸上屆祗有國幣一百三十三萬另九百五十九元七角一分、有效保額、總數結至二十四年十二月三十一日止錄後、</p>
<p>普通壽險　國幣二百六十二萬九千四百九十六元另一分、</p>
<p>團體壽險　國幣四百十七萬二千三百六十六元正</p>
<p>上列團體壽險、多係短期、其所需之準備金、已有相當提存、</p>

<h3>上海火腿販賣業　中國主編　（上海工商業概况之廿一）</h3>
<p>火腿之唯一原料為猪畜，猪畜乃農家副產，故火腿之製造皆在內地，上海僅為消費或販賣之市場。按火腿有南腿北腿雲腿之別，品質既異，價亦不同，至產銷情形則更懸殊，今均分述於後，俾得互相參閱，以窺全豹。</p>
<p>一、火腿之類別及其產銷概况</p>
<p>火腿有南腿北腿雲腿之別，前已言之。南腿産於浙江，俗名金華火腿是也。世人但知金華產腿，殊不知金華所產者僅其一部。其他如蘭溪，東陽，義島，永康，浦江，武義各縣，無不產腿，其中以東陽出品為最多，舉世皆知之蔣腿即産於該縣。浦江所產竹腿亦甚有名，惟產量不多耳。據一般估計，上述各縣猪畜產量每年約七十五萬餘頭，其中有四分之二以上即供製腿之用，製就之腿，經杭嘉而運銷於本埠者，約佔其大半。按南腿產額，少於北腿，惟近年來因嗜食南腿者較多，銷路已超過北腿。惟南腿本身之銷路，近年來亦在收縮之中，故其產量遂自前年之六，七十萬只减為三，四十萬只矣。今將各縣主要製腿業者之店號地址附後，作為本市行商進貨之參考：</p>
<p>蔣雪舫厚記東陽上蔣村，蔣雪舫正記東陽橫路，大東陽腿莊東陽城區，何乾元同前，蔣九峯同前，邵源泰金華城區，新味和同前，黃乾興同前，丁隆泰蘭谿後北里，永盛源蘭谿前北里，查德　同前，季萬新義烏城區，陳平順　烏西門，徐怡順義烏南郭，黃益茂義烏城區胡華記義烏西街，丁順昌義烏，裕大武義城區，（未完）</p>

<h3>美鋼鐵汽車股票漲風尤厲</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報吿、昨（六日）紐約股市、參差略升、鋼鐵投與汽車股漲風尤厲、發見五年以來之新高峯、後以多頭獲利出箱稍形回小，公用股於後亦起上騰、買進非常踢、鋼股之動作尙佳、農具興商業股挺進、鐵路與火油股升起數角、據鋼鐵雜誌估計、鋼鐵工作量現為百分之六四·五、升起百分之二·五、但數樂氏在美國鋼鐵公司股東年會時聲稱公司方面暫時尙無意還淸優先股之積欠股息、致稍感影響、小交易所股票靜而參差、債市略升、全日成交二百零三萬股、</p>
<h3>紗花　多頭不放籌碼缺乏　紗花形勢轉緊</h3>
<p>紗市穩靜、市塲成交雖見淸淡、然趨勢異常堅固、蓋以銀行界曁金業商證券商吸收之額、始終不願放鬆、因之籌碼殊感缺乏、而入於徘徊之一途、其勢亦極為堅强云、</p>
<p>標紗收盤益堅</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以大阪三品紗市平庸、同時現紗交易不暢、塲內買戶不多市場不脫呆滯無神之象、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌二·三角、惟本月漲二角、午後開盤、市價平常、二盤以後、漸形上昇、因市塲籌碼乾涸、且金融界逢低仍在加碼之勢、又聞現紗銷場較昨為旺、收盤時愈形堅挺、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一·二·三·六角、查賣出明德三百包、潤康八百五十包、信誠一千一百五十包、恒昌四百五十包、仁豐三百五十包、泰昌二百五十包、買淮裕大八百包、益記四百包、愼記五百五十包、長豐三百五十包、振大五百包、大昌成三百五十包、賡豐三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現銷微有起色</p>
<p>現紗銷路較上日為多、查全日各帮買去、統計六百二十包、售價堅挺、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市堅定、但海外棉業狀况、益覺暗淡無神、然大戶收進之棉、屹然不動、且關閉大批籌碼、所以形動較緊、但現棉消費岑寂、同業心思看疲、</p>
<p>標花多方準備收貨</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉漲跌互見、上落三至六磅音、印跌一羅比至一羅比七五、場中交易平寂、市態無勁、但多頭吸收之額、堅不放棄、結果近月勿動、遠月比上日收盤價漲五分至一角、午後開盤尙平、入後徐徐轉挺、因多方有準備收貨之說、大阪三品花漲二·三角、人氣轉挺、結果各月比上午收盤價漲五分至一角、查賣出聚興一千擔、合興一千二百擔、森康一千四百擔、益昶八百擔、大昶一千擔、信誠七百擔、錦昌八百擔、買進通記一千二百擔、明德三千九百擔、長和三千三百擔、愼記一千擔、長豐一千三百擔、潤康一千三百擔、源興昌一千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉消費廠需停頓</p>
<p>現棉消費仍滯、廠胃停頓、來源姚花二百包、通花二百四十包、</p>
<p>天津粗絨四六·七五　偉通廠進一〇〇件　現貨棧交同業頗多買進</p>
<h3>美棉尙形穩定</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月跌一至四磅音、國外消息不佳、然因同業·利物浦·大陸及遠東一致買進，尙形穩固、關於借欺棉花、人心　雜、近月因恐有在賣、多頭了結及南方賣出而疲、利物浦帮略有套寶、新棉因雨水過多、東部受損、西部缺雨、需要甚殷、結果現貨跌四磅音、期貨漲跌四至六磅音、據棉業交易所傳言、囤棉處上週售出現棉八二、〇〇〇包、尙有二三四、〇〇〇包未售、又估計全世界棉花存底、截至二日底止、共二三、三六三、〇〇〇包、內中美棉為一二、二七八、〇〇〇包、去年為二〇、二〇七、〇〇〇包、前年為一〇、七一七、〇〇〇包、又紐　崙交易所調查、三月底為止、八個月內九省共售肥料二、一二五〇〇〇噸、上年為二、二二五、〇〇〇噸、英棉現貨跌五點、期貨跌三四點、印棉市况暗淡、價因美棉借欵之影響而軟、計平果爾跌一至一·二五羅比、奧姆辣跌一·七五羅比、白羅溪跌一·七五至二·二五羅比、原電錄左、（六日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、七日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為一百九十八羅比半、較上日收盤漲一·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗平花漲</h3>

<h3>糧食　粉麥昨市均見疲軟</h3>
<p>粉昨粉市本在看小、乃有北帮在市收買、雖是心思而非實胃、人心亦稍帶穩、各月份市價均與前日收價相近、及至午後以天暖有益新麥收成、內地帮與行廠均有售出、業外囤戶亦多跟出、允以遠月新麥粉標、麥更為平軟、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、內地帮與行販均擬售出、良以天氣漸暖、麥收有望、業外囤戶亦無恃為望好之目標、一部份多頭即有隨市套出、進少出多、交易反見淸淡、午後賣風更旺、且粉市步小、市上人心更為不安、洋麥雖報漲、但定貨早已不划、市上各方均不注神於此、故行情依然步趨而下、現麥以貨少居站、昨由福新去車麥一千四百包、價仍開五元三角二分云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、旱狀未會稍减、空頭補進、此外則晨望頗佳、出口價格基準影嚮市况之力量有增加之勢、可見供給估討减少一、七八四、〇〇〇解、加麥增加七六三、〇〇〇元、</p>
<h3>食米銷塲依然不暢</h3>
<p>（滬南）咋日各帮來源、共祇到二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石、）本街銷路依然平平、包胃亦僅天津秦皇島帮辦近二千包、故雖到稀、市况仍形平定、厚早粳及薄稻行價悉無榮辱、杜洋尖及陰變元均平定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船廿一二號、市上各貨去路、白粳店胃平常、價無榮辱、薄稻零化仍呆、價小一角、羊杜尖平定、客尖定勢、陰元定立、變元和平、其餘各貨均無甚上落、</p>
<h3>客秈產地市面步高</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、各路到頭均减、尤以九江一路、每天祇有五六百包之零星小數、統計全日到貨不足三千包、且產價步高、裝販不合、貨主大半堅持、去化本街甚活、惟所存溫台各米、以身份不足、不宜久擱、恐致　爛、故多隨市求脫、因此其他各米亦不克上升、各檔市價均與前市相似、全日開出江西米二千包、台州米一千七百包、江北米三百包、又路碎洋米一百噸、統為本街辦去</p>
<h3>油豆大漲小回　客豆餅昨已登場</h3>
<p>昨日油豆因高價層出致人心反動、故在連電稍回標準繼跌之下、現貨略小、局勢仍須看連市升沉、豆餅銷場、祇有內地交易、汕頭帮寥寥、行情因油豆市昂貴、餅價益聚、昨日海中餅巳有兩批還到、共計二千六百三十九片、價開一元八角八分半、又訂開輪船沙河光邊餅四千片、開凍後第一批交、價為二元零七分、</p>
<p>油市　　生豆油飛漲聲中　棉籽油隨之昂騰</p>
<p>——價格增至十九元八角——</p>
<p>棉籽淸油市况、自前市提高至十七元七角之後、旋因廣帮胃口停頓、致一度回落至十六元、惟油廠方面終因籌碼缺乏、以故交易亦感寥落、自上月中旬以來、因豆油價格逐步上翔、市氣隨之振作、棉淸油市亦即由十六元增至十七元十七元半、後市繼續步增至十九元零、每决成交、不過三五十擔之間、迨至本月初、生豆油價格漲勢加厲、人心乃益呈緊張、本街需　亦更迫切、聞昨日順餘廠售開淸油四百擔、市巳飛騰至十九元八角、後市頗有再漲可能云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　英倫低莊紅茶銷路突好</h3>
<p>英倫為紅茶總匯之地、該處茶市之暢滯、關係絕大、據英茶商所得消息、邇來英倫紅茶市面、突起變化、中低莊紅茶、銷路非常活潑、高莊貨頓見呆滯、與前數月情狀、大相逕庭、蓋由於英荷茶商、决議限制生產、消費店家、乘機囤積所致、而高莊細貨、因價値過昂、去路未能進展云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　高生晒肉本街有需要</h3>
<p>——行盤漲起五六元——</p>
<p>石碼生晒　肉、因久乏運到、市上行號存貨業巳斷檔多日、昨太原輪由廈入口、巳有二箱運來、適値本街需要正殷、聞行方零星拆售、當即告罄、比前漲起五六元、據貨主函訊、產價亦升三元許云、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價平定成交無多</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平定、無甚上落、公會劃盤、廿四號粗砂白現貨廿二元、轉口六元九角八、東赤白均原價、惟四號白轉口貨小五分、為六元九角半、本廠綿白振紀一號廿元六角、金心大華一號均二十元八角、二三四五號照退、國產潮靑現市雖隨產價格略振、但交易未旺、暫難過好、昨僅開出冲提靑十包、十元八角、漳刁靑建帮續有開出二百數十包、價九元半、無更動、</p>
<h3>疋頭　法蘭絨布價續漲</h3>
<p>昨灰素色套頭法蘭絨、市銷甚暢、買方需要較之上週為殷、趨勞因之向榮、售價　續見漲、董申地存貨無多、同業半已售帮、四元零之法蘭絨、可謂搜羅殆盡、偶有執存者、皆相率喊沽五元、觀察後市、尙有再漲之勢、現頭號法蘭絨、　批每碼一律售國幣六元二角半、二號警通貨為五元七角半、三號貨五元左右、四號四元餘者、刻多斷檔、麥爾登底之紗貨每碼喊售三元二角半、</p>
<h3>安徽茶葉硏究（二）</h3>
<p>— 史紀法</p>
<p>滁縣全椒來安三縣：亦屬皖北，所產茶甚多，如全椒產者曰南譙茶，北譙茶，漢口人多喜飲用之，京滬較少，來安產新昌茶一名壽陽茶，香氣撲鼻，滋味濃厚，多飲不能止渴，售價較廉。全皖產茶甚多，冠於全國，除上述諸縣外，皖南之秋浦，涇縣，太平，銅陸，石埭，宣城，寗國，朗溪，廣德，諸縣。皖北之太湖，宿松，桐城，靈壁，諸縣均有茶產。除供各當地自用外，亦有零星小販運往鄰省出售者</p>
<p>種類</p>
<p>安徽產茶各縣所產茶之種類各有不同，茲將調查所得分述如次：</p>
<p>祁門：全縣山脈蜿蜓，地勢高峻，為天然產茶之地，在全徽州中推為最優最多之茶。全縣居民以茶葉為唯一生產。居民對茶樹栽培法，種種極富經騐與硏究，安微模範種茶塲曾將祁門各鄕茶種試騐，結果則以祁門西鄕茶種（圓形有一面平形者粒方殼厚）為特色，較贛閩湘鄂浙等省為優。南鄉茶種（圓形及三角形粒較小殼較薄）東鄕及城鄕茶種（多圓形間有三角形粒小殼簿）亦佳。</p>
<p>婺源：婺源福員頗廣，多山嶺產地分東鄕西門北門三區，以東鄕產額為多，北門西門次之。多產均綠茶，强公山所產　珠茶最　。</p>
<p>休寗：產額以　北二　　最多，南鄕茶久為外人所歡迎，北鄕白雲山松　山金龍山等處氣脈渾厚，所產有雀舌，蓮心；金芽數種。</p>
<p>縣：全縣產地甚多，最豐者為大州園，所產烘靑茶，炒靑茶，為全歙之首。他若老竹嶺所產之老竹大方茶。黃山蟠結於境內，所產天都雲霧等茶極負盛名。此外松　山尤佳，尙有紫霞山所產之茶，色香淸勝於蘭花，為不可多得之珍品。</p>
<p>夥縣：夥境狹小，多石山，產茶較少，其周家園茶種為圓形與弧三角形參半，亦為佳種</p>
<p>續溪：唯一產地為西鄕之八都，如黃　山，上金山，茶場，暮雲山等，產額均多，品質極佳，金山所產之時雨茶全國聞名，銷行華北尤巨。</p>
<p>霍山：全境皆產茶，甲於六安，因以統屬關係，名為六安所掩也。境內山高多霧，所產得天地淸淑之氣，不待人工掊植，其淸馨絕倫，無以復加。全縣所產之茶有珠蘭，茉莉，銀針，雀舌，梅片，蘭花頭，松蘿春，雨前，毛尖等，銷運皖北，山東，河南，河北，平津。山西一帶甚巨。茶種多雜角形，粒小。</p>
<p>六安：全境多山，產茶甚多，允以松　山所產之茶氣味香美，他山决之，初摘取之嫩芽，為白毫銀針雀舌等。繼採其嫩葉為梅片，菊花餅等，至立夏時採其嫩枝名為粉針。</p>
<p>廣德：皖南屬，亦產茶，茶種多三面圓一面平殼薄。</p>

<h3>希望在政策下的國貨工業</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨的生存，在國家的保謎政策，堅立國家的關稅壁壘，增高外貨的價格，以嘉惠國貨廠家，使國貨能興外貨競爭。如果不能實行保護政策，再加上外貨的漏稅走私，無法制止，不但國貨將被外貨打倒，國民經濟和國家財政，亦將受到嚴重影饗。白崇禧氏曾向兩廣實業考察團說：「國貨工業，苟無政策為之保護，苦力支撑，備受困危，結果總不免為帝國主義之犧牲品。」語重心長，為之寒心。吾們覺得目下的國貨工業，確是困難已達極點，同業的競爭，外貨的傾銷，已把方在萌芽的工業，日事斵喪，而捐稅的繁苛，運輸的留難，幣制匯兌的沒有統一，在在是工業進展的致命傷。允其是各自為政，各不相謀，中間喪失許多的精神財力，和無謂的糜費，這更是多麼的不經濟。我們在廣東考察國貨工業，允其威到一國的工業，沒有整個的計劃，和彼此溝通的辦法？便要發生這種不經濟的現象。譬如廣東是不生產棉花的，沒有羊毛的，那麼與其在廣東辦棉織毛絨工業，不如辦別種工業，來得有辦法，容易收到成績。總而言之，無論對內，對外，總要有政策，有整個計劃，國貨工業，纔有生存長足的希望。</p>

<p>市民服用國貨年雖然才開始不久，但是在這短短的三個月中，居然有幾件使人滿意的事，這似乎是値得我們欣慰的。</p>
<p>這幾伴是什麼事呢？第一就是本年一月份的出超，雖然，二月份又入超了。但是我們如果努力前進，則出超兩個字，似乎還有在報紙上發現的可能。可是這不在本文範圍以內、現在且置之勿論、再說第二件我們滿意的、就是新發明的國貨，竟不斷的出現，像本文所談的國貨睛雨兩用摺傘，就是其中的一項。</p>
<p>失敗是成功之母，這句話的確不錯。國貨晴雨兩用摺傘的成功，曾經過好幾决的失敗，但是結果呢？終達到成功的目的了！這種睛雨褶傘的發明人是聲君星磊，浙江省杭縣入，現在才二十五歲，祇受過小學的敎育，不過因為性情很合於工程方面，所以平常對於實用工具，是很喜歡研究的。在民國十七年，他那時才十七歲，小學畢業以後，經人介紹到津浦鐵路浦鎭機廠裏充當工具伕。工餘的時候，當閱讀各種的書報。在民十九年，他突然受着一種暗示，預備製造一種晴雨兩用的袖珍傘。自從立下這個志願以後，就時刻的研究，日夜的不歇久當時很有不少的人譏笑他，但是他總不為動。像這樣的研究了兩年，第一部是成功了！可是在呈請專利的時候，實業部因為製造未精，沒有批准。於是他又作第二步的研究，費了四年的光陰，再度呈請實業部准許專利，又因為使用不靈，批令再行研究改善。直至去年、才算全部告成、以前的使用不靈的弊病也沒有了、於是實業部准許專利、雖然費了七年多的時光，但是結果是很完滿的。</p>
<p>這種傘的製造材料，完全是國貨，外面的形式，和一個手電筒差不多，長的九英寸，圓徑的一英寸，摺起來的時候，可以藏在衣袋裏。用的方法是：先用手拿着傘的滑圈向上面推、另外再用一只手抽出縮在裏面的傘柄、撑開以後，和普通傘是一樣的。而且這種傘不但晴天可用；雨天也可以用，所以呌做晴雨兩用摺傘。也呌做睛雨兩用袖珍傘。至於要收縮的時候，也是先拿着傘的滑圈、再用另一手抓着傘柄、一手向左轉；一手向右轉；於是傘的滑圈向下勒，傘柄就向上收縮，又回復像手電筒那樣大小了！</p>
<p>龔星磊自得到實業部准許專利以後，現在正在頭備集資設廠製造，如果進行順利的話，最近的將來，市上將有這種睛雨兩用傘發現了！並且價格也不至很貴，差不多的人，都可以買得起呀！</p>

<h3>植桐與廣植其他油苗</h3>
<p>— 子</p>
<p>本月十二日申報國貨專刋載秋郎君之「在桐油大宗輸出期國人宜速計畫植桐」一文，立論精闢，指引允詳，以今日世界需要之迫切，及植桐獲利之豐厚，再加以政府提倡獎勵，國人銳意改良，則若干年後，質量加多，輸出激增，確為推銷國產挽回利權唯一的大道，閱讀之下，無任欽佩。但植桐固為當務之急，而廣植其他各種油苗，允為刻不容緩之事。蓋今年桐油出口激增之原因，一則基於各國軍事上科學上需要的迫切，一則美國所植之桐樹尙未屆收成之時期，故若謂數年之後，我國桐油出口仍能保持優勢，似未可必。所以為整個國民經濟着想，吾人一方面須促進國產之出口，一方面須减少洋貨之入口，現就洋貨入口觀察，煤油一項，每年的在一萬二千萬元以上，言之驚人！查煤油用途，幾全部充作燃燈之用，昔人云「一燈如豆，」「靑燈相伴」，乃指昔日未經改良之植物油燈而論，其光亮確實比不上現今佈滿全國之洋燈，故媒油銷路，日益暢旺，漏卮之巨，非我國桐油出口之數目所可相抵也。現在我國已有植物油燈之發明，（發明人鍾靈）其構造悉依科學原理，發光明亮，堪與洋燈抗衡，而安全，衛生，節省油量則過之，並有中國油燈公司（本埠山東路二一八號）製造銷售，舉凡我國各種植物油類，皆可燃用，故國人若能廣植油苗，足為燃料，其功效可以减少媒油進口，卽與推進桐油出口同一目的矣。至於國際戰爭爆發時，煤油來源斷絕，此允為國防之利器也。所望舉國上下，共同注意，利用荒地，廣植油苗，或則推銷於國外，或則利用於國內，一面增加出口，一面减少入超，實救國之要圖也。因讀「努力植桐」一文，聯想及此，質之讀者諸君，以為何如？</p>

<p>可是他的夫人黃季為女士，宗旨與他有些不同，她是主張有美麗的國貨，應當提倡國貨的，她見到他老是穿着骯髒的藍土襖，袴，便有些不開心而淘氣了！本來：土貨與國貨，在根本上是二而一，一而二的，沒有什麼尖銳化的矛盾！他也覺得他自己的土貨主張是要貫徹的，不肯低從夫人，於是他倆因為這個小小的微波！便奏起「離婚曲」來了！在某天雙雙簽字於律師之四，不過他倆雖然表面離異，實際還是藕斷絲連，友誼密切！春遊旅行歸來，促膝長談，郃並出示紡織合作社織成之「花呢」甚為美觀大方！她見而喜曰：「你何不早說？」相與展然！乃取消離異，重為夫婦如初！佳話傳播，資為美談！而無邊君之「多謝天孫重繫足，裳裁雲錦再成婚」的詩最覺貼切！吾曰：「花呢重繫並蒂蓮」眞是國貨史上的嘉話了！</p>

<h3>戈林將軍軼事</h3>
<p>— 萸譯</p>
<p>聽見講過新的香烟畫片嗎？一套「全副軍裝的戈林」。一百張畫片——各各不同的。』這是現在德國人互相密談的最新談話資料。</p>
<p>戈林將軍是德國的空軍部長兼普魯士總理，最喜歡穿漂亮的軍裝和掛燦爛的勳章。近幾個月中，他在德國發生了幾伴令人失笑的趣事，其中最通俗可說婦孺皆知的一件是浴室氾濫的事。</p>
<p>有一天，他在家裹洗操，浴室中積滿水了，他的男僕人奔到將軍那裹去報吿：「主人，浴室中的地板上已積起了六英寸深的水了！」「唔，知道了，不用立在這裹多說話，不許開口」，大槪戈林將軍有些動惱了，忽又高聲喚道：「拿我的空軍上將的制服來！」</p>
<p>這個男僕人拿着了這套制服的時候，却找不到將軍的勳章和徽章。他上上下下都尋遍，依舊是影跡無踪。末了，差不多到了完全絕望的時候，他忽然記起來了，勳章和徽章是放在那裹的。原來他在那天早晨，忘記把勳章和徽章從他主人的睡衣上取下來。</p>
<p>至於講到對於這位普魯士總理歌功頌德，而含有開玩笑意味的事，眞是多得不勝枚舉。最有意義最有趣味的是在去年結婚的時候，他所接到的賀禮中有一本照相簿。照相簿裹面貼的不是照相，却是關於他的趣聞軼事，登載在報紙上的，大批材料收集而剪貼成的。據說元首希特勒時常和他講起這份怪禮物，而講得哈哈大笑的。</p>
<h3>時曲與山歌</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>都市要的空氣中，一天到晚震顫着從無綫電收音機裹所播送出來的小桃紅一類的曲子，鳳陽歌一類的歌辭的聲浪，沒有一刻的寗靜，鬧得人頭昏腦脹，恨不得肋生雙翅，飛向我故鄉的農村中去。為的在我負山臨水的故鄉中，農夫村婦們，甚而至於女孩兒們，都會得隨口的唱着通俗易解，而意味深長的山歌。雖然這些山歌，都是未經作曲家譜上過五綫譜，自然，也沒有凡奧林伴奏，但是在鄉間空曠的大氣中，悠悠揚揚的唱着，其聲調之悅耳，而足以引人入勝，自非筆墨所可形容，而且也非親歷其境的，無法的加以意會。雖然我故鄉的山歌，很少含有艷麗而富有誘惑性的語句，但這是一種天籟，絕對不像都市中所流行的歌曲，完全是以辭句去遷就着曲譜那麼的牽强乏味。作者生長在農村中，所以對於村裹的山歌，有着相當的認識與愛好。因此，現雖寄身都市間，每當午夜夢回時，聽鄰家收音機中，傳出的繁絃急管聲，我總是喃喃地說，「討厭，誰愛聽這調調兒，我故鄉的山歌，那才是美。」</p>
<h3>一顆足以爆發的炸彈</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>但是這一遭，我是失望了。當我回歸故鄉去時，是沒會聽見過一闋我幼年時所聽慣的悅耳的山歌。在聯繫輸埠與我故鄉的航船中、就聽得船夫們，在哼着「大家一齊……」的調子，替代了舊有的「一個娘兒在河邊……」了。在半途，會聞得岸上行人，在哼着「輕撒網，緊拉繩，……和「桃花千萬朶，……」各一次。奔到家要，嫂子正在哼着「寶貝要睡覺，……逗孩子睡。屋子外的孩子們，合着聲兒，在唱「自從出了朱皇帝。……」昔日的「月子穿雲像怕羞，小姑娘嫁在石橋西……」一類的山歌，據說已沒人唱了。我於是不禁喟然地長歎道，「唉，這也侵入了農村了麼？」</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飲恨千秋</p>
<p>因為我兒童時候，經過一位敎師是紅臉腮大麻白鬍于。他說起話來，口沫四濺，手指脚蹈，很有點滑稽。他喜歡講故事，允其喜歡講愛情故事，我們倒比他是作燕子箋的阮大鬍子。我心理一揣想，不由得笑了起來。蘭厂正想追問我這一笑由何而來，却聽到一個婦人的聲音問：蘭厂先生在家嗎？這雖是一句普通話，却帶了不少的南京音。這南京語音，送到人的耳朵裹來，是最容易讓人認識的。這裹有南京女賓光顧，　也出於意料。於是我向門口看時，一個女賓隔了樹陰走過來了。老遠的看到也是穿了淺灰色的長夾衣，身材也很是瘦小。蘭厂已是搶着向前迎接，把他引了進來。近前時，自己看得淸楚，原來是一位五十來歲的老太太，他並沒有剪髪，梳着一個小　臀。在他圓　上，還帶了幾根銀絲，那可以知道他不能掩藏了他的蒼老。不過他的臉子，在瘦削之中，却沒有什麼皺紋，在微高的鼻梁上，架着一副托力克式的老式眼鐘，半遮掩了他那銳利的目光。他手夾了一個大皮包緩緩的走了過來。直到這小亭子邊。蘭厂就向我招招手說：這就是阮先生，我兄過來見見。我聽了這話，眞像走到松林裏滿心都是些粗枝大某，忽　遇到了一樹梅花。又是　奇，又是高興。　阮先生經蘭廠介紹一番之後，就向我鞠躬，笑說：對於你先生，我是久仰的了。我本來要到　　去奉訪，才是正理。不過索昧平生，我又不敢造决。聽說你光生能到蘇州來，我就高興極了。蘭厂讓這位阮先生坐下，我謙遜了兩句，便問：阮先生也下居在蘇州嗎？他笑說：不！蘇州是有福的人住的，我怎能够住在這裹？我父問：住在南京吧？他笑了一笑，接着說：我是天下為家的。我這　明白了，他還不肯以眞相示人。對於一位女太太，不管他是多大年紀，只管去追問他的行踪，那是沒有禮貌的事。因之也就默　的坐在一邊，暫不插言了。蘭厂家裹，是另有一部分女賓的，阮先生在亭子裹坐了一會，　讓他引到內屋去了。我把手撑着頭，呆想了一陣，心想，他那個大皮包裹，是含有一部辛酸史的。但不知道他怎樣的吿訴我？我有不大了解的所在，又怎樣去問他？我這樣揣想着，問座的方大白，就對我說：你想什麼，覺得道位阮先生有什麼奇怪嗎？（六）</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （華嘉）</p>
<p>不是第一次了，差不多常常會碰到，在上馬路，在南京路，在四川路，有時也在河南路或者山東路。一個穿着一件很老舊的長袍，臉孔很寬，但一切都很顯得沉滯，圓圓的頭，沒有濃密的頭髮，人很遲鈍的中年人，他老是盒着不普通的信封，有時也燒着一枝烟捲，走得很慢。只要我近他時，他便把那個信封送到我的面前，口裹常常是這樣說：</p>
<p>「少爺，少爺，你可曉得楊樹浦在什麼地方？」</p>
<p>第一决他問我時，我便指路便他，耍他出外瀾乘八路電車給可以到楊樹浦路無論什麼地方了。這樣他道了謝又走，但幷沒有照我指給他的路，相反地却走了反方向。</p>
<p>以後，我尾隨着他，他便又問第二個過路人，還是那麼問。這會這個過路人也許太忽忙了，沒有睬他。一會他又問第三個，這决這過路人恐怕是常常碰到他這樣問人的，便停也不停地走了。我心裏　在奇怪：他怎末老是問？問到了路又為什麼不照着走？這奇怪的心理，到現在還沒有解决。因為從第一次起，以後差不多我很常看見他這樣地問，而且問我的决數恐怕已不止十多次了。</p>
<p>現在我還是不明白，我以為他一定不是問路的，或者「楊樹浦」和他有過一點什麼「不可解决」的事，便使他變成這樣瘋癲地終天走在馬路上問路吧。不過他為什麼叉會這麼空的哩？難道他一天到晚都沒別的事情？難道他不會有一個時候醒悟的嗎？</p>
<h3>都良招同戌阿寥陽仲邕太希別宥諸先生集飲碧厂即席呈諸公</h3>

<p>前度游踪倐隔年。今同諸老此流連。向陽高閣臨湖峻。疥壁名篇鬥句妍。淸聖濁賢銘白墮。疏簪散髻感朱絃。一厂暫屬吾曹有。叢碧爭收酒碗邊。</p>
<h3>慈湖聯吟圖為俞季調先生題</h3>
<p>— 寥士</p>
<p>鶴聲一一上天飛。耆宿吟踪夢翠微。苔氣靑蒼凝石蘭。萍痕澹宕散波衣。厂登飲碧歡浮白。墓拜回風愴落暉。入書端須留掌故。湖光照變太依依。</p>
<h3>飲碧厂訪馮都良</h3>
<p>— 仲邕</p>
<p>聞子東歸喜不支。摳衣接武上巔壓。即看面目非中歲。祇覺　儀似本師。盃底湖光圓有暈。眼前經唱絕如絲。世衰亦感儒無用。却苦明朝叉別離。</p>
<h3>教鞭</h3>
<p>— 沈錫綱</p>
<p>敎鞭，本是一種敎便物。在敎師上講堂上課的時候，往往用着一根小竹竿指點着黑板上的白字，這樣敎師站在一邊小學生很容易看到黑板上的字而不遮沒綫。</p>
<p>此外，教鞭用以音樂課上的節拍，及帮助說話時的姿勢。更有用以來鞭打學生。</p>
<p>記得我在初小讀書的時候，我們的老師老是帶着一根光滑的敎鞭來上課，那是用一根細小的紫竹做的，外面再緊繞着淡黃的頭繩。每當我們坐得疲倦而有一些聲音的時候，他總是在講台上「拍拍」的抽了兩下。學生捫的聲音沒有了。他才安心的接着上課。事情眞凑巧，有一决，一年級裹的一個學生在上課時睡着了。他也不知道為了什麼而分外惱怒，於是，又用敎鞭在講台上重重地抽了幾下，把那個學生嚇得直跳起來，終於哭着回去吿訴他的媽媽。而且當夜發着寒熱。第二天，他的媽媽到學校里來向我們的老師問罪。結果，我們的老師表示十分的歉意，並且請了一位醫生替他的學生診治，費去了一些醫藥費。</p>
<p>大槪是他受了這一個刺激吧，從此，他來上課的時候，缺少了一根光滑而淡黃色的敎鞭。</p>
<p>這是在二十年前的事。現在我自己也做着小學敎師，每當看見同事們用着敎鞭上課的時候，我就想起了二十年前我的老師的故事。</p>

<h3>家庭常備之良方</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>諺有之：「單方氣死名醫」。微諸事實，儘有許多疾病，延醫診治，須費時日者，而世俗所傳之方，僅舉一二醫家認為無足重輕之物，投之，往往覆杯即愈。甚且有想入非非，為常理所不能明者，奇已！　者，雲南楊香池君，示我驗方一束：皆簡便易備；費錢不多，而又靈效卓著這法。刊之用，以利於貧苦之病家焉。</p>
<p>輕傷風微染風寒，頭昏體倦，鼻塞淚流，俗名輕傷風；可煮麵一碗，和肉湯三分之二，熱醋三分之一，多放辛辣椒料，加以葱薑少許，佐飲溫酒一杯，立時汗出而愈。</p>
<p>傷風久咳體弱之人，直大節令，——如二二分至等。易染傷風咳嗽，口吐清痰，每有日久不愈者；當以雞蛋三枚，去黃留青，盛之以碗調之以糖，再取生薑數片，荊芥二錢沸水煎之，然後以此水冲入蛋碗內，和而服之；每日晨起一次，臨睡一决，一二日便能見效。</p>
<p>初痢痢疾初起，煮木耳一二兩，去水，置碗內，調以醬豆腐汁，加山胡椒少許，用以佐餐；連食數日，重者减輕，輕者即痊。</p>
<p>久痢久痢不止，取松明燃之，滴其油於芭蕉菓皮上，加炒糊之糯米糖——卽飴糖——兩，煎服卽愈。又：草菓皮五錢，炭薑一兩，炒糊之糯米五錢，亦可止痢。</p>
<p>腹痛　不發寒，亦不發熱，而肚腹冷痛者：取胡椒十數粒，研末，並用　湯吞服之。</p>
<p>牙痛　患風火牙痛者：以煆石膏，白胡椒，研細為末；敷牙上，能止痛。</p>
<p>黃水瘡　黃水瘡，惡疾也。可煮羊食肉二次，速其作膿潰爛，七日包可結疤。</p>
<p>耳瘡　小兒耳內生瘡，用雄鷄膽汁滴入，一二日後，熱毒盡去，即行結疤；復以菜油潤之可也。</p>
<p>失眠　臨睡時以沸水冲穌油，加放冰糖；食之，最能養心安神，治失眠頗靈效。</p>
<p>防疫　備清醋一碗，入鹽，　，蒜，椒，各少許；另取生　服，切之成片，浸碗醋中；時取食，則瘟疫之傳染，可恃以避免矣。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>殺人不眨眼</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>本來在現今殺死個把人，又算得什麼呢？只要在一顆炸彈下，死的人數動輒以百十計，而吾人視之，猶如視統計之數然，無所動於中。這是什麼原因呢？顯然，戰爭已把吾們的心造成非常殘忍了吧？</p>
<p>然而吾們的心是不是眞正殘忍的呢？吾想是不會的！大概在報紙上見到百千萬的死人數目，沒有記載詳細的慘狀。如果記載出來了，我們難道也會大呌一聲：「啊！死掉一萬」！語調非常不經意嗎？</p>
<p>雷馬克的「西綫無戰事」搬上銀慕，給人對於戰爭的慘酷的印象是非常深刻的，好戰的希特拉之所以要禁止「西綫無戰事」原因大半在此。</p>
<p>對於集體的死（！）旣是如此，對於個人的死又何嘗不然？聽人說：某某地方一固人被人槍殺了，無所動於中。然而往往見到報紙上一個强盜槍斃前，面色灰白，行走無力，意識當然是入於昏迷狀况了。一個神父還在他面前代他禱吿，這一福悽慘的景象，讀之眞是使人感覺得透氣不過。為什麼人要殺死人呀</p>
<p>綁林日子的所謂要犯霍浦曼，現在是坐在電椅上一分鏡里發電三次而被殺死了。讓我們來讀一讀新聞吧：「……右足之褲已經撕破，俾便裝置電極。霍氏就坐電椅後，行刑人伊列華及其助手即將潮濕電經週繞其全身。電椅之前則有證人十二，新聞記者六人，靜聽其遺言…………然後撥動電扭，一響之後，霍氏身體向前蜷曲…………」够了吧！「那將潮濕電經週繞其身」，「霍氏身體向前蜷曲」並且還有人靜聽其遺言，這是多麼够偉大的的一幕嚴肅的觀死圖呵！我實在不忍卒讀。</p>
<p>最後，須得聲明，吾不是狹義的人道主義者，吾們曉得這種「人殺人」的慘劇在社會一日沒改造完善，那末是一日不會消滅的。吾們還是努力於改造社會至於完善的地步吧！</p>
<h3>售吸所</h3>
<p>— 馬</p>
<p>走完了三十里頂頭風的水路，船抵墳上的時候太陽己徧西了。如果是順風順水，打來回也該道時候了。叔父是老癮，在船上他已是哈欠速天了。他幾乎不像一個老走這水道的人，問着舟子過了十里亭沒有，五里塘沒有？又像官艙里沒有安放他的細身子似的，變着腰跨到前艙，再到船頭上。但是船頭上是猛烈的風，兩個舟子緊張地把持着前後的櫓與篙子，就是叔父的問話也懶得回答似的。他們這樣的努力，船還是彷彿凝固在河中心，沒有移前一尺半寸。兩岸都是田畝，沒有什麼可以觀望的，除了每五里路有一所塌破的茅亭，以備走路人休息的。我心里雖然也担憂着今天要到什麼時候才到墳上，這水道上在落黑之後常有強人出沒的，但是看着舟子們拼着性命似的工作，我沒有勇氣問他們了，而且有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>叔父從官艙到船頭，船頭回官艙十來趟，他漸漸地疲乏了，倒在鋪上祇是踩着腳，他要我在他的手提皮箱里搜尋一下，是否還可以找到一點可以過癮的東西。他出門時總是帶着這手提皮箱，也時常在底層或夾縫里安放一點私貨，但是今天為了祖母的催促，他沒有功夫預備那最重要的食糧，於是他駡起祖奶奶來了，那時候的叔父已完全失了人的理性，被那種毒物所支配着了。</p>
<p>船到墳上，他吩咐我一句「有什麼不懂的問看墳人」跟着一個佃戶急忙上售吸所去了。大的一個鐘頭，登記完畢，叔父還是沒有回來。天色已漸漸落黑了，晚上旣不能開船，自然先要設法下宿的地方。於是我要求看墳人帶我上售吸所去？</p>
<p>恐怕那是個布集，在角落里有一所低矮的瓦房，門口有一盞煤油燈，寫着三個紅字售吸所，據說那是公開的。走進門，就有一般濃厚的烟味向我鼻官里刺來，我幾乎打嗝噎。走進里室，完全被烟霧迷漫着，我祇聽見一個蒼老的聲音喊着姪少爺來了，同時有一張手把我拖過去。被一件堅硬的東西碰着我的臀部時，我才看渭楚是　張楊，叔父閉着眼睛睡在那里。叔父已經睡熟了，那個呌我姪少爺的喊他醒來，他又是精神抖擻了，他問我祭祀完了，舟子預備開船嗎？</p>
<p>我沒有回答，看墳人接着說了：二老爺，天落黑了，今晚宿在墳屋里還是落棧，我好回去預備被褥。</p>
<p>叔父彷彿不信任似的咳了一聲嗽，說：「已落黑了嗎？」然後又點點頭，「預備姪少爺的床鋪好了。」</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>看墳人剛走出，門外吆喝着蹌進二個人來，那個蒼老聲音的馬上迎着笑臉招呼他們，遞茶，授烟捲兒。那二個人向室里掃了一圈，指着叔父問了他一句話，他彎着腰回答：不認識嗎？就是二先生，都有照的。叔父那時候也從舖上坐起身來，他又介紹着在頭里的一個：這位是朱巡長。</p>
<p>朱巡長和叔父一談就談上了，兩個人在舖坑的上下首吹起烟來，彷佛是多年地老朋友似的。老闆遞茶，授手巾，忙個不停。</p>
<p>在售吸所里吃了晚飯，看墳人來領我去睡的時候，叔父說他宿在那里了，明天開船時去招呼他。</p>
<p>我當夜沒有好睡，鼻子像被什麽東西堵着，不很舒服。</p>
<h3>齷齪的女人</h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>春風彷佛一個爬蟲似的吹拂着，一夜未眠的莉萊，坐上車子後反精神恢復過來。她回憶着昨夜的事，似乎隔了一個世紀似的，而且幾乎不相信自己會那樣子墮落的。她抬起頭來望天，天是蔚藍的一片　太陽發展着它的熱力把世界完全　耀在光　之下，沒有卑鄙，沒有　　，新萊這樣想着時，她覺得自己是新生了，她敞開手提袋，想從小鏡子中照照自己的面容，但是一捲花綠的鈔票映進她的眼簾時，顧時失了知覺似的她沉　工車廂里了。「那個齷齪的女人呵！」彷佛有無數刻毒的目光集中在她的身上。</p>
<p>車子在她家門口停了，她付了車錢，用背樑靠着大門，她幻想爸爸那張憤怒的臉，媽媽泣哭的愁容，她希望自己立刻就這樣死過去吧！於是她眞像期待着死神降臨似的，合上了眼睛，但是門突然開了，她跌倒在一個人的懷抱里；那是她的媽媽。</p>
<p>媽媽正如她猜想的掛着愁苦臉。她沒有養得一個兒子，她說那是她前世里作了孽。但是丈夫却沒有這種想頭，他愛他的女兒像兒子一樣，他送女兒上學校讀書。但是在一次戰爭中他失業了，在常時期的苦難日子煎熬下，他終於由同居的慫恿把女兒送進了舞塲。然而他吿訴女兒：這是不得已的辦法，我不希望你賺這種錢來養活我，祇要你的爸爸找着一份職業的時候，你還是或以去求學的。他慚愧地拍着女兒的肩頭，女兒第一次看見她爸爸掛了兩顆清淚。</p>
<p>於是女兒忍着各種侮辱做舞女了，她從光明的日子轉到黑暗的地獄中了。但是她永遠牢記着爸爸的話，她沒有把自己看做一個舞女，她衹是正當地去賺每一張舞票，她期待着幸福的降臨，做他爸爸慾望中的女兒。</p>
<p>現在她哭倒在媽媽的懷里，她太使爸失望了，雖然那不是自己的罪惡，在那黑暗的地獄中是處處埋伏着惡毒的野獸呢，一個女孩子怎能抵抗這種惡劣環境的壓迫呢！她慢慢跟着媽走進臥房道，爸爸衹是用冒火的眼睛打量着她的全身，彷佛要透視女兒身上的齷齪。媽把女兒抱緊着，和溫地說：好好地問她吧，你衹有這樣一個女兒哩！</p>
<p>「哼！我不要她再來見我的面，我沒有這種丟人的女兒！」他從抽屜中搜出一柄剪子來丟在女兒面前：「不然，就給我死去！」</p>
<p>女兒看着爸冒火的眼睛，她不由地又哭了，爸是怎樣教悔着自己的，她不想向爸剖白，她衹希望快些死去，如果她的生命不結束，她將永遠受着那種侮辱呢！她猛地從媽懷里跳出來，想去搶那柄剪子來自刎，還可以留得一個乾凈的靈魂。</p>
<p>媽馬上把女兒拖住了，一邊頓着脚哭起來：「我前世里作了什麽薛，就是一個女兒也要逼死她啊！」</p>
<p>這樣，爸氣得發靑了面孔，發狂的把女兒推了一掌　幾乎像和敵人决門似的。當女兒最倒在角落里的時候，那個手提袋里的鈔票掉在地中心，花花綠綠的像每張野獸的臉。</p>
<p>爸的清涙又從眼腔里掛了下來，用拳頭擊着自己的腦殼，像一個瘋子似乎用脚踩踢那些散亂着的鈔票………</p>
<h3>娜拉（二十）</h3>
<p>— （萬超塵作圖）（忻忻說明）</p>
<p>林敦夫人去了之後，郝爾茂正和娜拉溫存着，南陔醫生來了。郝爾茂：（嘴裹咕嚕說）討厭，這時候他來幹什麽？（高聲）等一等！（開門）進來，你眞要好，從來不肯過門不入。</p>
<p>南陔醫生高高興興的受用了一晚，臨走，他要了一支雪茄烟，由娜拉給他點上了火，跟娜拉互相說了「我望你安睡」之後，便點點頭走了。</p>
<p>郝爾茂去開了信箱，在信箱的鎖上，他發現了娜拉的簮。</p>
<p>取了信回來，他們發現了南陔醫生的畫着黑十字的名片，那預報着自己死訊的名片。</p>
<p>娜拉雖下了决心呌郝爾茂看那些信，但是郝爾茂會了得到那位臨死的好朋友的死訊，掃興得很，便拿了信逕自回他的房裹去了。</p>

<h3>Soviet-Mongolian Agreement Signed; External Affairs Ministry Files Strong Protest; Considers Infringement on Chinese Sovereignty; Chinese Government Will Definitely Not Recognize It; Yan Huiqing Requests Leave to Return Home to Treat Old Ailment</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia have signed an agreement stipulating that in the event of an attack by a third party, both sides will provide mutual defense assistance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this action clearly infringes upon Chinese sovereignty and violates the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924. A strong protest has been lodged with the Soviet Union, and it has been declared that the Chinese government will definitely not recognize the agreement. (7th Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia signing a mutual assistance agreement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has attached great importance to it after receiving the news and has made inquiries from various sources. It has now been confirmed that the Soviet Union did indeed sign a type of agreement with Outer Mongolia in Kulun on March 12, generally stipulating that in the event of an attack by a third party, both sides will provide mutual defense assistance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that since Outer Mongolia is a part of China, and in Article 5 of the Sino-Russian Agreement on General Principles for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues signed on May 31, 1924, the Soviet government also clearly recognized Outer Mongolia as an integral part of the Republic of China and respected China's sovereignty within that territory, the current unauthorized signing of an agreement with Outer Mongolia by the Soviet Union clearly infringes upon Chinese sovereignty and violates the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924. It is reported that a strong protest has been lodged with the Soviet side, and it has been declared that the Chinese government will definitely not recognize the agreement.

<h3>Export of Lu Salt to Japan: Awaiting Order from the Ministry</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The export of Lu salt to Japan is awaiting the implementation of an order from the Ministry of Finance.

The office previously restricted production due to excess salt production, examining the needs of the Changlu area and limiting annual production to six million dan. Beach households sell at any time to avoid stockpiling capital, so beach households have no anxiety. In order to reduce moisture and increase sodium chloride in salt produced in the Changlu area, it must be sold every other year. Therefore, salt farms must also store enough for one year's use.

<h3>Xiangling City Has Been Recaptured</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) On March 31, more than 2,000 communist bandits gathered near Xiangling City, carrying more than 60 cloud ladders. They besieged Xiangling County City at 3 a.m. on the 1st. Because there were no troops stationed in the city, only a small number of security groups and a police force with more than 40 guns, the county magistrate and squad leader risked leading the police to resist outside the city during the bandit attack. After fierce fighting for a long time, they were eventually defeated due to the disparity in numbers and were captured. After our army lifted the siege of Linfen City, they attacked the bandits on the afternoon of the 4th at about 5 p.m. The bandits in the city gates and nearby areas were repeatedly attacked by our Liu Brigade toward Jindian Town and Poshen Village on the afternoon of the 5th.

After our army concentrated fire on the east bank of the Fen River, the bandits in the city gates could not hold out and retreated into the city, still attempting to defend themselves by relying on the city walls. Our army approached the suburbs and selected brave soldiers to launch a fierce attack on the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and began to flee the city in various directions. The Liu Brigade recaptured Xiangling City on the night of the 5th and entered the county city. At the same time, they continued to pursue and suppress the bandits. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and losses in this battle. (7th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Recent Speculative Markets in Goods</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>I previously wrote a commentary on "New Changes in the Shanghai Speculative Market" that briefly described the nature of speculation in goods and its recent developments. Here, I will elaborate on it to express ideas that were not fully conveyed before.</p>
<p>Speculation in goods has a very complex nature, and speculators should be especially cautious. This is because important domestic commodities such as cotton and wheat are agricultural crops, and their yields are greatly affected by the weather. Factors such as sunshine, temperature, rainfall, and the presence or absence of wind, insects, and disasters all have a significant impact. Furthermore, these types of crops are so-called international commodities, and their activity is not limited to the domestic market. Fluctuations in international supply and demand have a significant impact on price changes. For example, the cotton market depends on the production of American, Indian, and Egyptian cotton, as well as the conditions of the Liverpool industrial goods market, for its shifts. The wheat market is largely controlled by the production of American, Canadian, and Australian wheat. If one is ignorant of world conditions and engages in blind speculation, there is little chance of escaping sacrifice. Let's take the Shanghai wheat market as an example: "Recently, the domestic weather has been warm, and a good harvest of new wheat is expected. Furthermore, the prices of foreign wheat have also been continuously falling slightly. As a result, the prices of flour and wheat in the Shanghai market for near-term and distant months have all fallen across the board" (see yesterday's commercial news section of this newspaper). This shows that the natural environment at home and abroad controls the market far beyond what human power can control.</p>
<p>Currently, the futures prices in the goods market are inevitably too high compared to spot prices. Observing this phenomenon, one can see that the speculation factor is stronger than the actual goods. Taking cotton as an example, the price of this month's futures contract is one or two yuan higher per dan than the spot price of fine cotton. Compared to the spot price of coarse cotton, the difference is even greater, with the futures price being as much as three yuan higher per dan. Therefore, both strong bears believe that delivery is worthwhile. Despite repeated threats of taking delivery from various parties, they remain unmoved. It is rumored that the quantity of those preparing to deliver coarse cotton this month is quite considerable. Conversely, for those who are prepared to take delivery, if it is a hedging nature, there will naturally be no problem. However, for pure speculators, after suffering losses such as commissions, warehouse rent, and insurance (estimated at 5 jiao per dan per month in national currency, not including interest), and then selling the goods as spot goods, they will have to suffer a hidden loss from the difference between the futures and spot prices. If a certain type of coarse cotton is difficult to find a buyer, the loss is even more difficult to estimate. This is a double risk. The futures and spot prices of goods are closely related. If the futures price is pulled up too much, forming an uneven situation, then the actual goods will not be strong. Even if the futures price is raised temporarily, it will not last long. The recent trend of cotton prices becoming flat and weak due to limited spot transactions can serve as an example. In short, the key to speculating in goods lies in making a precise study of the factors influencing the value of the goods. If one blindly follows the crowd without regard to the domestic and international environment, frantically pulling up prices when they rise and throwing them away when they fall, it is not appropriate. I sincerely hope that current speculative merchants will pay close attention to this.</p>

<h3>Koki Hirota's Appointment as Ambassador to China Unlikely to Materialize Due to Lack of Army Approval</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since Arita Hachiro was appointed as Foreign Minister, the government has been working on selecting a successor as Ambassador to China. Under the current circumstances, it is almost certain that Koki Hirota will be transferred as Ambassador to China. However, ambassadors and military attachés to China must be decided upon after the Foreign Ministry and the Army Ministry have consulted with each other. The Army believes that Vice-Minister Hirota is not suitable for the position of Ambassador to China. Recently, the East Asia Bureau has expressed this intention informally. Therefore, if the government formally starts selecting a successor ambassador, the Army's intention will become more apparent. If the government does not disregard the Army's intention, it is feared that Koki Hirota's appointment as Ambassador to China will be difficult to materialize.

The main points are as follows: Starting from the 25th year of the Republic of China, schools at all levels should set up quotas as determined: 1. Free Quotas (exemption of tuition fees): (A) Elementary schools should, in principle, not charge tuition fees. Strict examination and supervision of the implementation of this principle should be carried out. Even those that still charge fees should be ordered to gradually increase the number of free quotas each year. (B) Secondary and higher vocational schools should each set up at least 5% or more of the total number of students as free quotas. In the future, the number of quotas should be increased year by year according to the ratio set by the ministry. 2. Public-Funded Quotas (exemption of tuition fees, provision of minimum uniform, meals, books, and other expenses to students): The number of quotas for the 25th year is set at 2% to 4% of the total number of students in the school. In the future, the number will be increased year by year according to the ratio set by the ministry.

<h3>Sharp Drop in the Market Price of Copper Coins in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The market price of copper coins in Tianjin has recently plummeted again, with the exchange rate exceeding 460 coins per yuan. According to investigations, this is due to the low price of copper coins in various counties and the issuance of tens of thousands of yuan of copper coin notes by the Peiping Agricultural and Industrial Bank in Tianjin, resulting in supply exceeding demand. The Public Security, Finance, and Social Affairs Bureaus convened a meeting on the 7th with the Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, and the Tramway Company to resolve the situation. It was decided to change the legal price of copper coins, allowing merchants to use the market price as the standard, while maintaining the legal price of 460 coins per yuan for copper coin notes. The three bureaus will jointly submit a request to the Municipal Government, asking the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to recall some copper coin notes to meet social needs. The Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank to facilitate the exchange of copper coin notes for merchants and the public. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Albanian Emperor Seeks to Reorganize His Forces, Vows to Fight to the Last Against Italian Troops, Although the Imperial Guard Has Suffered Setbacks, Morale Remains Good, Italian Troops on the Northern Front Advance Another 50 Kilometers South</h3>
<p>(Albanian Capital) The Albanian Emperor told a Reuters interviewer somewhere south of Guarran today that Abyssinia has not been defeated. My army plans to fight to the death until not a single Italian aggressor remains in Albanian territory. We certainly do not want to beg for peace. The news spread by the Italians is all fabricated, he said. The Albanian Emperor is currently reorganizing the Imperial Guard, which suffered setbacks in Lake Ashangge. Although they have been devastated, their morale remains strong. The Albanian Emperor also complained that the League of Nations has repeatedly decided to postpone the implementation of truly effective sanctions, allowing the enemy to use the most cruel and barbaric tactics in order to achieve a victory before the League of Nations intervenes. The details of the great battle north of Lake Ashangge are now being revealed. The Albanian Imperial Guard did suffer heavy losses, but according to the Albanian side, the Imperial Guard only lost what it had gained before strategically retreating. In this battle, the Albanian Emperor personally operated a machine gun on the front line and did not sleep for two whole days. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, told a Reuters interviewer at the general headquarters in Enda Bausus today that everything is over.

This battle was almost the fiercest battle since the start of the war. At the same time, it was reported that Italian troops had advanced another 15 kilometers outside Guarran today and reached Alamada on the Daisi Avenue. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, telegraphed from the front line, stating that the Italian troops on the northern front are still attacking the Albanian army south of Guarran.

<h3>French Cabinet Approves Peace Plan for Germany, Advocates Forming a League of Nations Army to Maintain the Alliance, and Restoring the Geneva Protocol</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Council of Ministers met at the Presidential Palace at 3 pm today, presided over by President Lebrun, and adjourned at 7:10 pm. Foreign Minister Flandin reported on the diplomatic situation before the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council and the Second Locarno Conference. The Council of Ministers approved the French reply to the German memorandum. The reply is divided into two parts. The first part advocates negotiations with Germany. If the negotiations fail, the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty should fully implement the draft agreement signed on March 19 and advocate prohibiting Germany from building fortifications in the Rhineland region. Talks between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium should be held immediately. The second part contains a broad European political and economic construction plan that distinguishes between issues directly related to the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty and general issues related to the League of Nations, and uses a collective security system as its foundation, which will be achieved through a treaty signed by member states of the League of Nations within Europe. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources, the French response to Hitler's counter-proposal contains a peace plan that advocates the organization of a League of Nations army to protect the alliance and monitor its implementation. Each major country should contribute four divisions of mechanized standing troops, and each small country should contribute one division. It is said that another part of the response states that France intends to take countermeasures in view of the irreconcilable nature of the German letter of March 31, but this section will not be written in the response and will be declared by Foreign Minister Flandin at the Locarno Treaty country meeting in Geneva on Wednesday. The new French plan also contains the following matters: The League of Nations should amend the treaty. If it needs unanimous approval, it should abandon this system and change to a two-thirds majority vote; amend the peace treaty by peaceful means; transform the economic system; manage armaments; restore the 1924 Geneva Protocol. The document was passed by the entire League of Nations Council, but became a waste of paper due to the opposition of one vote from Britain. According to the protocol, the League of Nations intends to strengthen sanctions against aggressive warfare and seek a solution when the League of Nations alliance contains ambiguous points. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the new French peace plan will be sent to the governments of Britain, Italy, Belgium, and the League of Nations Secretariat today, its detailed contents will not be announced until Wednesday or later at the earliest, because the British government has requested amendments to a part of the plan. (7th National Press Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German and French Suggestions to be Submitted to the League of Nations for Discussion and the Convening of a European Peace Conference</h3>
<p>(Paris) It is generally predicted that both the German memorandum and the French counter-proposal will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for discussion. The date of the Council meeting will likely be after the re-election of the French Chamber of Deputies (the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled for re-election on the 26th of this month, with a second round of voting on the 3rd of next month). At that time, it is possible that a European peace conference will be convened at the beginning of the summer this year. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government's counter-proposal to the German memorandum will be published within this month after being delivered to the governments of Britain, France, and Italy. This counter-proposal consists of two memoranda. One refutes the reasons given by Germany for abolishing the Locarno Pact. The other is a constructive proposal for the organization of a peace mechanism, containing twenty-five articles in total. Its main point is to divide Europe into several regions, with countries within each region establishing mutual assistance pacts, stipulating a military mutual assistance system, and strictly adhering to and abiding by the constraints. This pact originates from the principle of collective security and is based on the Covenant of the League of Nations. Its declaration within the scope of the League of Nations distinguishes it from ordinary military alliance treaties. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Journal reports that the French new peace plan's suggestions are very broad, totaling no less than twenty-five articles. Although the detailed content has not yet been made public, there is little doubt that it will elaborate on the necessity of a collective security system. Moreover, the collective security system it advocates will insist on Russia's participation, otherwise it will not be very effective. (Guomin News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government's counter-proposal to the German memorandum needs to be discussed with the other signatory countries of the Locarno Pact and the countries of the Little Entente. It will not be made public until tomorrow evening. Foreign Minister Flandin received Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu at 11:30 this morning to discuss this counter-proposal. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Decides to Keep Discharged Soldiers in Service - A Total of 175,000</h3>
<p>(Paris) During the State Council meeting yesterday, a decision was made to keep all soldiers scheduled to be discharged on the 15th of this month in service pending further orders. According to a press release issued by the Ministry of War, many new recruits who should have enlisted several years ago were temporarily exempted from military service. It was not until April 15th of last year that they were conscripted. By the 15th of this month, they will have completed one year of service and should have been discharged. However, most of them will still be kept in service. According to the original French military service term, it was set at twelve months. In June of last year, the government issued an order extending the military service term by six months. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the State Council decided to keep the soldiers who were supposed to be discharged on the 15th of this month in service, responsible officials announced that there are a total of 175,000 such soldiers, accounting for half of the normal peacetime quota. This is because the defense works of the Maginot Line in the east (named after the former Minister of War Maginot who decided on it) are the most modern and must be garrisoned by well-trained soldiers. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>British, French, and Belgian General Staffs to Begin Talks Mid-Month; British Representative Goes to Geneva</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden departed today for Geneva to attend the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian War and to attend the meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact to consider the situation caused by Germany's abandonment of the pact and reoccupation of the Rhineland. Before leaving, he consulted with the High Commissioner of the South African Union and the Australian Representative in London on the attitude Britain should take. Lord Privy Seal Halifax will also go to Geneva later to assist Eden in participating in the Locarno conference. The talks between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium to consider plans for responding to unprovoked aggression against France and Belgium will begin on April 15th. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the talks between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium, it was previously reported that they would begin on Wednesday, the 8th of this week. Responsible parties have now denied this, saying that with Easter approaching, political circles generally need to take a holiday. These talks will naturally be held after the holiday. According to inquiries by our agency's reporters, the date for the start of the talks has been set for around the 15th of this month. It is also reported that Britain, France, and Belgium have already drafted a plan for air bombing Germany, which will be implemented if Germany commits aggression. Responsible parties have also explicitly denied this, saying that it is regrettable that such unfounded rumors are circulating in the newspapers. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Thirteen-Nation Committee to Discuss Peace Today; Fears of No Major Results</h3>

The authorities of various European countries have decided to attend, including French Foreign Minister Flandin, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, and British Foreign Secretary Eden. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov cannot leave the country due to matters of state and will be represented by the Soviet Ambassador to France, Potemkin. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü is also unlikely to attend in person and will be represented by the Turkish Envoy to France, Davaz Suad. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden and the Australian representative Bruce (Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations) departed for Geneva at 2:00 PM today. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is widely believed that the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee to be convened on Wednesday this week will not have major results. The Thirteen-Nation Committee is currently in a very difficult position. On the one hand, the Italian government insists that it will not be prepared to start peace talks within the League of Nations framework unless the League of Nations cancels sanctions. On the other hand, the British government insists that Italian troops must first cease all military operations in East Africa before direct talks can begin. Therefore, this meeting will be preparatory in nature and is unlikely to contribute to a concrete solution. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the report to be submitted by the Chairman of the Committee, Madariaga, which is a report on the progress of contacts with representatives of the two parties involved, Italy and Ethiopia. The content will cover two points: 1. Regarding the procedures for peace negotiations, Madariaga exchanged letters with the Italian government, and the Italian government invited him to visit Rome. Whether this should be done will be decided by the Committee. 2. Regarding the issue of the Italian army's use of asphyxiating gas, the Ethiopian government has repeatedly complained to the League of Nations, and foreign public opinion, especially British public opinion, has expressed dissatisfaction. This issue will also be considered by the Committee. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Thirteen-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet in Geneva the day after tomorrow to discuss the issue of peace between Italy and Ethiopia. It is widely rumored here that the peace terms to be proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will be based on the treaty concluded between Italy and Ethiopia in 1895 to resolve the current dispute. According to this treaty, which was concluded one year before the former Ethiopian Emperor Menelik decisively defeated the Italian army at the Battle of Adwa, the entire Ethiopian regime, including its foreign policy, would be controlled by Italy. Political figures here have stated that if the Italian Prime Minister puts forward this proposal, it will inevitably intensify anti-Italian sentiment in Britain. It is expected that Foreign Secretary Eden will request the Council of the League of Nations to tighten sanctions against Italy after he arrives in Geneva. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Madame Tabouis, the diplomatic correspondent of L'Œuvre, recently commented on Italy's peace plan for Ethiopia. According to her, the main points of this plan are three: 1. The areas currently occupied by the Italian army should be ceded to Italy as colonies. 2. The Ethiopian mainland, that is, the purely Amhara region, should become a mandated territory, with sovereignty still belonging to the Ethiopian Emperor, but an Italian Governor-General and several experts should be stationed in the Ethiopian capital to handle economic, financial, and international issues. 3. The remaining parts of Ethiopia should be placed under Italian protection, as France does with Morocco. Italy should supervise all matters related to Ethiopian currency, roads, schools, and hospitals, but the rights and interests enjoyed by other countries should still be respected. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>German Representative to Leave England for Home Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(London) The German representative, Ribbentrop, has been staying here for a week since he arrived on the 31st of last month to present the German government's memorandum on the draft Locarno Agreement. It is now heard that he is scheduled to leave here for Germany on Thursday (the 9th) of this week. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Italian Representative to (Geneva) Attends Locarno Conference; Does Not Attend Thirteen-Nation Committee Meeting. The Italian delegation to the League of Nations, led by Sir Aloisi, departed for Geneva this afternoon to participate in the conference of signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, which is scheduled to be convened on Thursday the 5th, to discuss the new peace plan proposed by the French government. According to responsible authorities, the delegation will not participate in the talks of the Thirteen-Nation Committee because the Chairman of the Committee, the Spanish representative Madariaga, has not accepted the Italian government's invitation to go to Rome to discuss the preliminary negotiations on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. (Guomin News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A foreign ministry spokesman stated today that Italy will send a representative to the Locarno conference to be held in Geneva on Thursday, but will adopt a completely reserved attitude towards various European issues until the League of Nations cancels sanctions against Italy. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Thirteen-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to meet in Geneva on the 8th of this month. The government has appointed Aloisi, the chief of staff of the Prime Minister's office, Roccu, the director of the League of Nations affairs department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Bellasi, an official of the foreign ministry, as Italian representatives to attend the Committee. Political figures previously believed that the Chairman of the Committee, Madariaga, would always come here before the meeting to contact Prime Minister Mussolini on all matters. Unexpectedly, the Committee convened the meeting without waiting for Madariaga to come here, which is quite surprising. At this moment, peace between Italy and Ethiopia must be achieved through direct negotiations between the two parties. If a peace proposal is established after negotiations between the two countries and is accepted by the League of Nations, Italy will not oppose it. However, if all peace negotiations are initiated or even controlled by the League of Nations, Italy cannot trust it. It is generally believed that the convening of the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee is clear evidence of the renewed activity of countries advocating sanctions. However, since the Italian army has repeatedly won victories in the northern route of Ethiopia, the outcome of the battle has been determined and cannot be affected by sanctions. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>British and French Ambassadors Hold Talks with Italy; Italy Guarantees Not to Bomb Addis Ababa</h3>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador to Rome, Drummond, has received a guarantee from the Italian government that Italian planes will no longer bomb Addis Ababa and undefended towns in Dire Dawa. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Rome correspondent of the Matin newspaper recently submitted a report on talks between British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond and the Italian Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Suvich, saying, "British public opinion has reacted to the recent developments in the Italo-Ethiopian War, especially to the Italian army's use of asphyxiating gas. The British government has instructed Sir Drummond to inform Suvich of the information obtained in London and to tell him that such actions can be exploited and exaggerated. With the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations imminent, Italy should avoid them. It is reported that Suvich did not pay much attention to this notice and replied that the Ethiopian army had repeatedly used brutal means against the Italian army, so the Italian army used poisonous gas in retaliation." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Secretary Suvich recently met with French Ambassador Chambrun and British Ambassador Sir Drummond to discuss matters related to the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Lithuania Abandon Suspicion and Repair Relations; Economic Relations Return to Normal</h3>
<p>(Berlin) There has been resentment between Germany and Lithuania due to the Memel autonomous region issue. Recently, the countries want to restore normal relations. Lithuania sent a delegation to this city on the 9th of last month to negotiate with the German authorities. It has now been learned that both parties have reached an understanding on several important issues, namely the restoration of normal economic relations. Other outstanding issues will be resolved later. The Lithuanian delegation returned to their country yesterday evening. (Havas, 7th)</p>

Near this city, the number of deaths has exceeded 300. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia. A major storm passed through Gainesville, Georgia today, killing 100 people. According to witnesses, when the wind came, it was like thousands of locomotives being driven together. The extent of the loss is still being investigated, but it will probably not be small.

<h3>US Government New Tax Bill Completed by House Committee; Strong Opposition from Business Community</h3>
<p>(Washington) Dalton, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, announced that the committee's review of the government's new tax bill will probably be completed today and hopes to submit it to the House for discussion within a week. Although the Republican opposition is very strong, he is confident that it can be passed in the way the committee has drafted it. Today, according to reliable sources, the business community is prepared to oppose the bill with all its strength when the Senate Finance Committee reviews it. Therefore, even if the bill can be passed by the House, the opposition still hopes that the Senate will veto it. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hauptmann's Corpse Cremated</h3>
<p>(New York) Bruno Hauptmann, the main culprit in the Lindbergh kidnapping case, was executed last Friday. His body was cremated here today. According to New Jersey law, the dead prisoners cannot be given a funeral. Therefore, only three or five people, including his defense lawyer and pastor, participated. Outside the crematorium, there were many onlookers wanting to break in, so 28 policemen maintained order at the door. (Guomin News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>US Secretary of War Speech Strongly Advocates for Modernizing Military Equipment and Building Airplanes to Rival Other Countries</h3>
<p>Chicago. In his speech today at the 19th Anniversary of the US Entry into World War I commemoration, Secretary of War Dern said that the US Army, in terms of its equipment, is still far behind other countries. Most of the US airplanes are obsolete. The old wartime tanks could only travel four miles per hour. We are now building hundreds of new aircraft that are at least comparable to those of other countries, but we have few tanks that can reach a speed of 40 miles per hour. The commemoration of the Great War makes us realize that any war in the world may involve distant countries. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Iraq and Hejaz Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty; A Step Towards Arab National Amity</h3>
<p>Cairo. Iraq and the Saudi Arabian country (i.e., Hejaz) signed a treaty of mutual assistance in the event of war or revolution. The text was published today. The people here are very excited and regard this as a step towards Arab national amity. In the treaty, the two countries declared that they would not take any actions that would harm the other party. If there are any disputes, they will be resolved by peaceful means. One of the most important clauses is that Saudi Arabian King Ibn Saud accepts the implementation of Article 17 of the Covenant of the League of Nations (regarding the resolution of disputes between the two countries), even though Saudi Arabia is not a member state of the League of Nations.

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Dueling with Opposition Leader; Pistols Fired at Each Other, Fortunately All Missed</h3>
<p>Budapest. When the Defense Committee held a meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Gömbös and Dr. Rassay, the leader of the largest opposition party, had a verbal confrontation. Neither showed any weakness, so Gömbös decided to duel with Dr. Rassay today to determine right and wrong. The two men each held a pistol and shot at each other. Fortunately, all the shots missed. They wanted to fire again, but were stopped by the arbiters. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary. Eckhardt, the leader of the opposition Smallholders Party, had a dispute with former Prime Minister Count Bethlen in June of last year. Bethlen said at the time that his accusations of Eckhardt's statements originated from messages passed from Prime Minister Gömbös. Eckhardt immediately sent someone to Gömbös to ask for an explanation. Since then, there has been resentment between Gömbös and Eckhardt. When the Defense Committee of the House of Representatives convened a meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Gömbös gave a speech that again invaded Eckhardt, who considered this an intentional insult and requested a duel. It has now been learned that the two men dueled with pistols at ten o'clock this morning. Neither was injured, but they did not reconcile. During today's duel, Stranjanszky, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, served as a witness for Prime Minister Gömbös. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>General Nanjirō Reports to Military Authorities on Manchurian Military Situation; Does Not Believe Japanese-Russian War Will Occur</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) General Nanjirō, the former commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, concurrently the Japanese ambassador to "Manchuria" and governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory, returned to Tokyo yesterday after handing over his duties. Today, he reported to the General Staff of the Ministry of the Army on the situation of "Manchukuo" during his tenure. He then met with visitors, saying that he was surprised that Japan is now harboring war panic. The border between "Manchukuo" and Soviet Russia, except for the Amur River and Ussuri River areas, is mostly unclear, so border conflicts are inevitable. However, it will not affect the general situation between Russia, "Manchuria," and Japan. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>Austrian Conscription System: Small Entente Countries Unite in Protest, Citing Violation of Military Clauses of the Treaty of Saint-Germain; Reserve Right to Take Appropriate Measures to Protect Interests</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The Small Entente countries, namely Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, due to the Austrian government's decision to restore conscription, have today sent a note verbale via their respective ministers to Vienna to Austrian Foreign Minister Waltinigg, strongly opposing this move, considering it a violation of the military provisions of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, and reserving the right to announce plans to protect the interests of the three countries at a slightly later date. According to Austrian official circles, the Austrian government does not wish to react negatively to this protest, viewing it as a warning to Hungary and Bulgaria not to follow Austria's example. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The governments of the three Small Entente countries (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania) have jointly submitted a letter of protest regarding the compulsory labor and military service system adopted by Austria, stating that after Germany abolished the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and restored conscription in March of last year, the Council of the League of Nations passed a resolution on April 17th condemning unilateral violations of the treaty. Austria's restoration of the conscription system constitutes a unilateral act in violation of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, and the Small Entente countries naturally reserve the right to take appropriate measures to protect their own interests. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Following the protest by the Small Entente countries regarding Austria's labor and military service system, semi-official sources here have commented that this was initiated by Yugoslavia and Romania, with the Czech government taking a more moderate stance. The Neue Freie Presse stated, "Austria has suffered more from peace than any other country in the world. There is no reason for the protest of the Small Entente countries. People often speak of Austria's rights as an independent country, but on the other hand, they do not allow it to restore its military. This kind of argument is clearly contradictory." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: Following the joint protest by the governments of the Small Entente countries regarding Austria's adoption of the labor and military service system, political figures here have commented that this action by these countries is a firm refusal to set a precedent, so as to prevent Hungary from using it as an excuse to abolish the military clauses of the Treaty of Trianon, and is also the first sign of a concerted effort to safeguard security. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The governments of the Small Entente countries jointly lodged a protest yesterday regarding Austria's adoption of the labor and military service system. The full text has now been disclosed by various newspapers. The Vreme newspaper commented, "Although the language used in this protest is mild, it is extremely clear and resolute. The permanent political conference of the Small Entente countries is scheduled to hold a meeting here on May 6th, at which time it will definitely decide on a common attitude that each country should take regarding this matter."

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Foreign Policy: Sanctions and Peace Negotiations Proceed in Tandem; Opposition Party Strongly Criticizes</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin, due to the government's failure on the issue of equal pay for male and female civil servants on Wednesday, today moved in the House of Commons, asking the House to vote to express whether it has confidence in the government. The motion was subsequently passed by 361 votes to 145.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Attlee was the first to attack the government's foreign policy, particularly criticizing its handling of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, saying that the government leaders had failed to perform their duties in recent years, causing the impetus to shift from Western democracy to the hands of dictators, and the dangers of war are spreading daily. Since the Hoare-Laval Pact for Italo-Ethiopian reconciliation was exposed, the government itself has lacked credibility. The Italo-Ethiopian war is not a question of whether Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will overthrow the Emperor of Ethiopia, but of whether an aggressor nation will overthrow the League of Nations. Hitler's destruction of the Locarno Treaty and his advance into the Rhineland were the result of the League of Nations' failure. If the Locarno Treaty were to be used to resist aggression, its basis would be too narrow. The entire strength of the League of Nations should be used to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Sinclair and Conservative Party member Churchill both supported Attlee's remarks. Sinclair criticized the government's policy toward the Italo-Ethiopian war, advocating for stronger assistance to the victims of aggression. Churchill believed that the government's policy had achieved nothing, alienated Italy, encouraged Germany to commit illegal acts, and did nothing to help Ethiopia or enhance the prestige of the League of Nations. The lesson from this tragic history is that if the government does not have the sincerity and the willingness to intervene to the necessary extent, it should not intervene in such events.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Eden replied that since both sides had accepted mediation, the Italian government had intensified its aggressive acts. From the perspective of the British government, empty mediation in Geneva while the war was still ongoing was intolerable. Now, there must be genuine mediation that can end the war within a limited time frame. The Committee of Eighteen must continue its work. As for the British government's position, it has remained unchanged. The British government is prepared to participate in economic and financial sanctions plans, but other countries must implement them with the same spirit.</p>
<p>Eden went on to mention the meeting planned by the signatories of the Locarno Treaty, namely Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, saying that the British government could not participate in such a meeting while acknowledging the hopelessness of mediation, but felt that exchanging opinions might not be without benefit. He agreed that the League of Nations should discuss it first, as Hitler's proposal involved countries outside the Western powers. Therefore, this proposal should be adjusted by the League of Nations. If, by the end of the summer, we can see that all European countries are members of the League of Nations, that a new structure for Western Europe can replace the Locarno Treaty, and that security elsewhere is also stabilized due to the League of Nations' direct supervision, then the security we obtain for Europe will be significant. Only then can we proceed with larger plans concerning the economy and armaments. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Next, Churchill, leader of the Conservative Party's extreme wing, rose to speak, first stating that the relationship between the government and the majority party was no longer as close as before, and then attacking Prime Minister Baldwin and the Cabinet, criticizing them for failing to prevent aggressor nations from holding a winning hand, saying, "From now on, the rewards obtained by aggressor nations will be far more advantageous than those granted by the Laval-Hoare plan." Churchill went on to discuss the impact of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute on the European situation, saying, "Our country has exerted pressure on France to take action against Italy, but unfortunately, this action has not been sufficient to help Ethiopia, merely alienating Italy and France, and allowing Hitler to seize the opportunity to tear up treaties and advance into the Rhineland area." Discussing Germany's demand for equal rights to colonies, he said that the Cabinet must clearly state its position, "At this moment, the abuse of ethnic minorities within Germany is constantly occurring, so the idea of handing over mandated territories and colonies to Germany cannot become a question. (Members of the House cheered in approval). In any case, mandated territories and colonies cannot be handed over to Germany. They can only be handed over to the League of Nations, as only the League of Nations has the right to decide the future fate of these places. Regarding this matter, the government must hold firm to its purpose and announce it clearly." At this point, Churchill discussed Germany's dispatch of troops to the Rhineland, saying that there was no doubt that Germany would quickly build strong defensive fortifications in the area facing France. However, what kind of consequences would this have on the diplomatic situation and strategy? In his observation, after Germany completed its defensive fortifications on the French border, it would only need to station a small number of troops on the banks of the Rhine, which would be sufficient. Its main army could then leisurely point north and advance to spy on Belgium and the Netherlands. This is a matter of great concern. At this moment, the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium are about to hold talks. The significance of this is that Britain has already established contact with France and Belgium, and if the two countries are invaded without provocation, Britain will certainly fulfill its promise of mutual assistance, even if it leads to war. (A small number of members cheered) (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, in the House of Commons today, answered Churchill's question regarding Germany's demand for the return of its colonies, saying that even if Germany had this demand, Britain would not give up any of its existing territories or mandates. As far as he knew, no one had ever suggested that Britain should give up any part of its territory. Britain could never accept such a demand. When the mandate was granted, there was no thought that the mandate could be changed. He believed that the transfer of the mandate required at least the consent of the mandated country and the Council of the League of Nations. The statement by Colonial Secretary Thomas that the British government had not considered and did not wish to consider the return of any territory or mandate had made the British government's position completely clear. Although he did not guarantee the future government, he felt that regardless of the fate of mandated territories owned by other countries, no British government would ever discuss the issue of transferring its own mandated territories. The government recognized that it had a real obligation to the people of the lands it had been mandated to govern. Unless it was certain that the interests of all the people within that land were fully guaranteed, the government would not consider handing over that land to another country, even for the sake of achieving a complete peaceful resolution. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin, when presenting his motion today, briefly stated that the motion for equal pay for civil servants, regardless of gender, was proposed by Labour Party MP Wilkinson and passed by the House of Commons on April 1st by a vote of 156 to 148. This motion was not without merit, but the timing was not yet ripe. There was a feeling spreading throughout the country that the large number of unemployed men was due to women taking their jobs. He estimated that the equal pay motion would increase annual expenditure by £3 million. He believed that Ms. Wilkinson's proposal would not increase the convenience of employing women but would instead hinder it. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons debated the "Female Civil Servants Salary Bill" last night and immediately held a vote. The majority obtained by the Cabinet was only 216 votes, which was less than the usual 250 votes or so, and had already decreased. Although this case was not related to foreign policy, opposition members deliberately involved foreign policy issues and gave this debate first-class importance. At that time, members on both the left and right sides of the House launched fierce attacks on the Cabinet's current foreign policy. All observers believed that this was beyond the Cabinet's expectations. For example, Conservative Party extreme right-wing member, former First Sea Lord Churchill, held the same tone as Independent Labour Party member Maxton. Even Conservative Party former Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain asked for explanations on various key points of the Cabinet's current policy. Foreign Secretary Eden had no choice but to change the pre-arranged procedure and rise to express his views. (According to the pre-arranged procedure, it was originally intended that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain would conclude the debate). The most noteworthy point of this debate was that the Italo-Ethiopian dispute suddenly became a first-class issue again. The atmosphere in the House yesterday was unusually tense, which was different from the situation during the discussions at the beginning of this year. Recently, news of the continuous defeats of the Ethiopian Northern Army had reached this place, and the House was therefore fierce. Opposition members believed that the defeat of the Ethiopian army was due to the British government's sanctions policy being too weak. Among the government members, since the former Foreign Secretary Hoare resigned due to the failure of the Italo-Ethiopian peace plan, there had been some doubts about the foreign policy implemented by the Cabinet, and these doubts have now been aggravated.

<h3>Bulgarian Amnesty</h3>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian King Boris signed an amnesty decree today during the Easter memorial prayer meeting held at the Greek Catholic Church here. As a result, a total of 317 prisoners serving fixed-term sentences have been released. The sentences of 24 people who had been sentenced to death but had their sentences reduced to life imprisonment have been commuted. The sentences of all other prisoners have also been reduced according to precedent. (Guomin, 6th)</p>
<h3>Spanish President Considers Issue of Advancement and Retreat</h3>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish Parliament is scheduled to resolve the issue of President Zamora's re-election tomorrow. It is expected that Parliament will approve the President's dissolution of the previous Parliament. As a result of the election, the left wing won and the right wing failed, which shows that the failure to dissolve the previous Parliament was not enough to represent public opinion. However, if Parliament does not approve of this matter, then Zamora will automatically resign and be replaced by Speaker Barrio. Judging from the current situation, the Socialist Party has decided to file an impeachment motion against the President to overthrow him. According to Article 88 of the Constitution, if it can obtain the support of three-fifths or 163 of the members of Parliament, it can be established. However, it is questionable whether the Socialist Party can rally this number in Parliament. However, it is heard that the President's side is now considering the issue of resigning before Parliament initiates such a move. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Discovers Large Quantities of Communist Propaganda</h3>
<p>Steadily entering via U.S. Ports</p>
<p>San Francisco: According to news from Japanese newspapers here, communist propaganda materials are constantly entering Japan via U.S. ports. Japan is now dispatching police officers to the United States and Honolulu to investigate their source. Those who smuggle communist pamphlets into Japan are mostly merchant sailors who pass through U.S. ports. It is heard that these pamphlets are printed in Japanese by the Communist Party of the Pacific Coast of the United States, and those who distribute them are ship workers traveling between U.S. and Japanese ports. Although Japanese customs and police have been conducting strict searches, large quantities of communist texts have appeared in places such as Tokyo, Kobe, Yokohama, and Osaka. The Japanese police have decided to trace their source and have dispatched personnel to the United States. These people are ordered to cooperate closely with the personnel of the Japanese consulates and local authorities, because these propaganda books are printed in Japanese, and the American police do not understand Japanese, so it is difficult to discern their nature.

<h3>Japanese Plan New Railroad Network in Northern Manchuria: Increase Number of Trains, Develop Military Mission</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Since purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Japanese puppet regime has established a puppet railway bureau in Harbin as the center of the railway network in northern Manchuria. Important officials are all Japanese. They are actively building branch lines and adding train schedules to exert the greatest possible mission in military transportation and complete their plans. However, they claim on the surface that these measures are due to the progress of trade in northern Manchuria, the convergence of goods, and the sharp increase in passengers, and are due to the needs of the times. This railway plan is said to be a network for the transport of northern Manchurian industries, and the recent transport volume has increased by 50% compared to before. Passenger trains on the Binzhou Line and the Binsui Line, etc., are very crowded, and the transportation of goods is also overwhelmed. The Japanese are now formulating new plans to implement new transportation in northern Manchuria, which will be completed recently. It is found that the new transportation network secretly contains an extremely large and powerful tool in military terms. Its current train schedule: "Jing"-Bin Line: In addition to the original four round trips between the puppet Changchun and Harbin, it is planned to add two more trips. Binzhou Line: In addition to one round trip per day between Harbin and Manchuria and one mixed round trip per day between Harbin and Ang'angxi, each will be increased by one trip. Binsui Line: In addition to one round trip per day between Harbin and Suifenhe and one mixed round trip per day between Harbin and Yimianpo, each will also be increased by three trips. Not only has it been fully decided, but it is also planned to carry out a mixed train round trip between Hengdaohezi and Mudanjiang, a temporary mixed train round trip between Yimianpo and Hengdaohezi, and two additional trips between Yimianpo and Mudanjiang.</p>
<h3>Suggestions from the Shantou Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society: Protect Overseas Chinese Going Abroad, Strictly Ban Shipping Companies and Inns</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: People from Chaozhou and Meizhou rely on going abroad for work to make a living. However, last month, some who went to Siam (Thailand) were, in the Bangkok area of Siam, accused by the local government of entering the country illegally. More than 600 people were detained, sentenced to 100 days of hard labor, and then deported back to Shantou. Similar incidents have also occurred in Singapore, Annam (Vietnam), the Dutch East Indies, and other places. Therefore, on March 27, the Pacific shipping vessel returned to Shantou from Saigon, carrying more than 400 people who had been expelled. Among them, more than 130 were from Guangzhou and Zhaoqing. It is said that they had sold their property or borrowed money from relatives and friends in their hometowns to get dozens of dollars for travel expenses, and were transported to Singapore for work. This group of over 100 people traveled on a small ship, passed through Hainan, and sailed south. When sailing near a small island in Annam, they ran out of water and food and encountered a large storm. The customs patrol ship intercepted them, and after inquiring about the reason, learned that they were Chinese laborers sneaking into the country. Fearing danger along the way, they were transferred to the Pacific steamer and transported back to Shantou along with those expelled from Siam and Annam. After landing, everyone expressed great disappointment, because they had suffered hardships, which goes without saying, and they had lost their travel expenses. Returning to their hometowns, it would be difficult to make a living. The Shantou Charity Hall then tried to send them to Hong Kong so that they could return to their original homes. After the news of the more than 600 people detained in Siam spread to Chaozhou and Shantou, their families came to Shantou to inquire about the inns and headmen who handled the matter. Those involved in the case had already fled. The Shantou Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society specially reported the truth of the case to the government and requested the authorities to seriously ban it in the future. The original text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>After the Singapore government restricted the import of Chinese laborers, the Nanki and Bonin companies, which are agents of foreign ships in the city, used the excuse of high exchange rates to increase the third-class ticket price from more than 20 yuan to more than 90 yuan. Due to the restriction on the number of tickets, they privately set up second-tier inns. Because demand exceeded supply, they were able to manipulate ticket prices, which then rose to more than 100 yuan per ticket. Generally, young people were unable to raise huge sums of money for travel expenses and could only stay in their homes. Such monopoly profiteering should be banned.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when rubber prices rose, the Singapore government gradually increased the import quota for Chinese laborers, from 1,000 to 4,000 per month. The two companies outwardly said they were reducing prices, but in reality, they were still monopolized and manipulated.</p>
<p>The treacherous merchants, inns, and headmen colluded with each other, went to the countryside to advertise price reductions, solicit passengers, and handle all ticket procedures. They collected ticket money from passengers in advance. When the passengers arrived in Shantou, the inns did not recognize the accounts, which was like colluding to deceive the villagers. This type of case has been seen repeatedly.</p>
<p>The Bonin and Nanki companies, which sell tickets on behalf of foreign firms, still sell tickets for 40 or 50 yuan each for women and elderly passengers going to Singapore and Penang, which are not restricted. The headmen must bring four or five women and elderly passengers to get this price. Otherwise, the price is over 100 yuan per ticket, with all kinds of exploitation.</p>
<p>When each ship leaves Shantou, the two companies must send staff to the ship to check the tickets. According to regulations, children are half price. If the price is slightly higher, they are forced to buy a full-price ticket. If they do not make up the difference, they are expelled from the ship. Why did the Guiyang steamer hide as many as 400 passengers? The Charlotte steamer hid more than 180 people, and the Yamei steamer hid as many as 24 people. The general manager and staff checked the passengers and heard nothing. It is undoubtedly colluding for fraud.</p>
<p>When the ships depart, the city government also sends many inspectors to the ship to check passengers to prevent trafficking. How could they not have discovered that hundreds of people were hidden? There is obviously something else going on.</p>
<p>The passengers on the Guiyang steamer were mostly lured by inns and borrowed money for travel expenses. Now they are being deceived and imprisoned in a foreign country. Their families are starving and worried. The shipping company and inns should be ordered to repay the original amount and compensate for the losses to show fairness.</p>
<p>The main criminals in this case are the people in charge of the shipping companies, the compradors, the inns, the headmen, and the ship's partners who collude to hide passengers, disregard human life, exterminate humanity, insult the national image, and should have their business licenses revoked and be strictly arrested and prosecuted.</p>
<p>The above eight matters are the appeals of the Mutual Aid Society on behalf of the general overseas Chinese. On the 30th, the East District Pacification Headquarters specially convened a conference for this matter. Those present included Chief of Staff Li Yukun, Military Affairs Director Luo Xianxiang, Political Affairs Director Feng Jianhuang, Shantou Mayor Chen Tongchang, and more than 30 representatives from all walks of life. After discussing for three hours, the following measures were decided: The losses of the overseas Chinese passengers imprisoned in Siam will be investigated by the Mutual Aid Society to recover the original amount. If they dare to resist, they will be arrested and prosecuted. In the future, if anyone is found to be acting as a substitute for hiding passengers in the cabin, once discovered, they will be fined ten times the amount. If there are any gangsters who fabricate Singapore residence permits to deceive people into thinking they are old passengers, after the case is cracked, they will be fined 1,000 yuan, with 80% of the fine given as a reward to the informer. (The new passenger tickets to Singapore and Penang should be registered, and the city government should convene relevant groups to discuss appropriate measures.) The customs officers harassing returning overseas Chinese should have their treatment changed by Customs Director Ye Han. The inns charging excessive travel expenses to returning overseas Chinese should have their fees reduced by the Inn Association. It is said that after the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office is established, there is hope that the above resolutions will be implemented. (April 2)</p>
<h3>The Four Department Heads of Guangdong Province Inspect Key Political Affairs in Counties and Cities</h3>
<p>—Supervise the Improvement of Various Facilities—</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The first three-year administration plan of Guangdong Province expired at the end of the 24th year of the Republic. In order to understand the achievements of the past three years and prepare to formulate the second three-year administration plan, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee decided yesterday that March, April, May, and June of this year will be the period for administering and reorganizing the past three years, and ordered the department heads of the provincial government to take turns to inspect the counties and cities within the period, supervise the county and city mayors to earnestly improve the key political affairs of the past, and immediately instructed the Guangdong Provincial Government to implement it. After receiving the instructions, the provincial government ordered the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education, saying, "Now that the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government has issued instructions, we have investigated the implementation of various local key political affairs planned by the province for three years. Have the county and city mayors been perfunctory and procrastinating in the implementation of government orders? Can the local people actually benefit from it? It is necessary to conduct detailed inspections, reorganizations, and improvements to increase efficiency. It is hereby decided that March, April, May, and June of this year will be the period for administering, reorganizing, and improving the past three years. The provincial government is instructed to instruct each department head to take turns to visit each county and city in person, supervise the county and city mayors to earnestly improve the key political affairs of the past that concern public interests, so as to achieve practical results and eliminate formalism. The progress of the handling shall be reported at any time for the record. This is most important. This order, etc., must be obeyed. In addition to distributing it to each department for compliance, we also order the Guangzhou Municipal Government to comply with the inspection of its subordinate organs, urge them to be earnest in the reforms, and submit a reply. It is hereby ordered to the department head to immediately comply with the handling, and report the progress of the handling at any time as proof of review and transfer."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>—(Special Correspondent Cheng Jun)</p>
<p>(4) Banditry and Local Conditions in Chongyang</p>
<p>Chongyang, formerly known as Xiajuan, belonged to Tongcheng. Later, it was divided into two. It was first named Chongyang in the Song Dynasty. It has an area of approximately 540,000 mu. It is surrounded by mountains, which account for about three-quarters of the total area. Only one-quarter of the land is arable. The east of the county borders Tongshan, the southeast borders Tongshan and Xiushui County in Jiangxi, the south and southwest are also connected to Jiangxi, the west borders Tongcheng and Linxiang County in Hunan, and the northeast borders Xianning. The territory is surrounded by mountains, and only the county seat is flat, hence the name "Heavenly City." Various towns are distributed, including Dashaping, Baini Bridge, Lukou, Zhukou, Chengshi, Xiaoshaping, Xintangling, Caijiadun, Hongjiaqiao, and Shichengwan. The folk customs have always been simple and honest, and the income from farming is sufficient to maintain food and clothing. However, due to the excess production and the proximity to the border area of Hunan and Jiangxi, the Red Bandits often entrenched themselves in the area, which is a major disaster for the locality. The reporter arrived in Chongyang on the 22nd. A curfew was imposed at night, and the market was unusually desolate, which shows the strong atmosphere of bandit suppression. On the 23rd and 24th, the reporter visited various places and investigated nearby villages. After two days of effort, the reporter learned a lot about the banditry and the local situation. First, the banditry: Badou Mountain in the southwest of the county has been occupied by bandits since the sixth year of the Republic of China, and later seized by the Red Bandits. It has not been cleared for nineteen years. The power of the government has also not reached the area for nineteen years. Yaogu Mountain on the western border is jointly managed by Hunan, as well as the large and small Chakeng, the Guibei Mountain in the southeast, and the large and small Donggang, and the Huangpao Mountain in the south, are all bandit dens. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the city fell twice. The first time was in February. No one can tell the exact number of people killed and property lost. The second time the city fell was on June 24 of the same year. Bandit leaders Peng Dehuai and Li Can led more than a thousand followers to attack the southeast gate fiercely. An uprising broke out inside, and beacon fires rose everywhere. The bandits rushed in through the west gate. Team leaders Liao Chuhou and Tian Daqi, and more than forty militiamen were killed in action. The people suffered great losses. At that time, the bandits were going to set fire to destroy the entire city. An old man stood up and reasoned with them. The bandits were subdued and did not do it. Since then, there has not been a day of peace in the county. In recent years, bandit suppression in Jiangxi has been smooth, and Hunan has also launched a large-scale clearing of the countryside. The remaining bandits have all fled to southern Hubei. Chongyang is the first to bear the brunt. The Xu Yan Gang faction of the pseudo-Sixteenth Division is the most brave. After Chen Jicheng, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, supervised the army and launched a fierce attack, the Xu bandits were finally wiped out last autumn. The remaining bandits disappeared and did not dare to come out and graze. In recent months, the Pingliu bandits have been rampant. The remnants of the Xu bandits have reorganized in Jiangxi, led by pseudo-Division Commander Wei Ping and Fang Buzhou. They fled from Huangjin Cave in Jiangxi to Tianyue Pass, then to Zhajin, Kuyuan, Jiuqu Ridge, Huangpao Mountain, and then to Dayuan Gaotuan, Jintang and other areas. This group of four to five hundred people killed and kidnapped people everywhere. Even if the ransom was paid, nine times out of ten the hostages were torn up. However, the families of those kidnapped still dare not but offer all they have in the hope of survival. Recently, the niece and nephew-in-law of Minister Wang Shijie of the Ministry of Education were kidnapped by bandits and their fate is unknown. Other scattered bandits, in groups of three or five, harass everywhere and are capable of killing and kidnapping people. In addition, there is the Gong Dehai faction, with about 200 people and guns. Gong was originally a notorious bandit, and was recruited by Feng Yuxian, commander of the Thirty-third Division, and compiled into a guerrilla captain. The bandit nature is difficult to tame. He surrendered and rebelled again, namely the famous Xi Xiazi. Recently, the Red Bandits have been rampant. Gong issued a declaration, expressing that he would not cooperate with the Red Bandits and would help to suppress them in his spare time, but he would not surrender to the government army. It is a strange thing for bandits to issue declarations. Currently, the troops stationed in Chongyang include the Third Regiment of the Fortieth Division of Liu Peixu. This division was originally the Independent Thirty-seventh Brigade and was expanded into a division last autumn. It has been stationed in southern Hubei for a long time, and its military discipline is still good. In addition, there is Shu Qinyi, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the Fifth Security Regiment, who is also able to cooperate with the army. Scattered small bandits are often wiped out, but the larger factions such as Wei Fang cannot be wiped out in one fell swoop due to the wide defense area. On the 22nd, a certain unit of the Liu Division pursued bandits to Dayuan. The bandits suddenly changed the flag to the Independent Thirty-fifth Brigade of the National Army. The officers and soldiers mistakenly thought it was a friendly army to encircle and suppress them, and were attacked. Two company commanders and many soldiers were injured. After a brave counterattack, the bandits fled. Their cunning can be seen. Chen Jicheng, the commander-in-chief, arrived here from Puqi on the 24th, and immediately coordinated with the Luo Lin Department stationed in Pingliu, Hunan, the Tan Daoyuan Department stationed in Yichun, Jiangxi, the Feng Xingxian Department stationed in Tongshan, the Li Zongjian Department stationed in Puqi, and the Liu Peixu Department stationed in Chongyang to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression. The reporter wanted to go to the front to inspect the bandit suppression front line, but because the bandits were constantly fleeing, they were strongly discouraged by the people of Chongyang.</p>
<p>According to the resolutions of the joint suppression conference of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, it is divided into three stages. The current stage is the clearing of the countryside. After the clearing of the countryside is completed, it will be followed by self-defense and Baojia. At present, the organization of self-defense and Baojia in Chongyang can be said to have taken shape, but it cannot exert its effectiveness. It is roughly the same as Puqi. The strong men's team is composed of 35,966 people, with only 365 guns, and they rarely have the opportunity to receive training, so it is difficult to use them to defend against bandits. In terms of Baojia, the county originally had five district offices. The first district governs six joint Baos, 57 Baos, and 562 Jias. The second district governs nine joint Baos, 65 Baos, and 785 Jias. The third district governs seven joint Baos, 72 Baos, and 777 Jias. The fourth district governs seven joint Baos, 59 Baos, and 611 Jias. The fifth district governs seven joint Baos, 67 Baos, and 718 Jias. A total of 41,814 households, with a total population of 178,657 men and women, are compiled. Now, according to the provincial order, it is divided into three districts, and the district office will be established soon. However, the drawbacks of Baojia are that it is difficult to find the right people for Baojia chiefs. The Baojia chiefs are still honorary positions, with low status and heavy responsibilities. Such as the requisition of husbandmen when the army is mobilized, the requisition of workers during road construction, and the collection of mu donations by the management office, all are asked of the Baojia chiefs. Wherever the Red Bandits pass, the Baojia are afraid that their crimes will be unforgivable. Therefore, those with a little property or knowledge all flee and are unwilling to accept the position. Those who manage to get the position are arrogant and regard themselves as local emperors. The people of one Bao or one Jia are unable to live in peace. Last winter, Division Commander Liu shot and killed one evil Bao chief, which slightly restrained them, but it is difficult to make them effective. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Commissioner Convened Subordinates for Instructions</p>
<p>Wang Gongyu, the administrative inspector of the Songjiang District, led his secretary and others to inspect various agencies in the county government at 8:00 AM yesterday. He returned to the office at noon. At 1:00 PM, he inspected the drills of the soldiers of the Twelfth Security Brigade, commanded by Brigade Commander Zhao Zanchen. He considered the drills to be proficient and praised them. He then went to the auditorium of the stadium, convened the staff of various agencies, and gave instructions, emphasizing three points: 1. Improve the atmosphere, 2. Increase efficiency, 3. Implement vigorously. He said that public officials have a leading position among the residents. Their words and actions are enough to improve the social atmosphere. Work should be tense, so that they can be a model. He said that vigorous implementation is the most important thing to pay attention to, so as to make politics clear. He then convened the heads of various agencies to discuss opinions on political improvement. At 4:00 PM, he inspected the police.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Fire in the Firewood Business in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Recently, fires have occurred frequently in the county, causing devastation. At around 10:00 AM on the 7th, a fire broke out again in Zhou Peisheng's firewood business in Qianbang, in the city. The fire was fierce, and in a moment, it penetrated the roof. When the firefighters from various districts heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, the three large rooms in the firewood business had been completely burned, resulting in heavy losses. Fortunately, it was in broad daylight, and no major disaster occurred. However, the neighbors were quite alarmed.</p>
<p>Strictly Supervise Farmers to Burn Rice Roots</p>
<p>The county suffered a heavy loss from the rice stem borer disaster last year. In order to prevent future troubles, County Magistrate Peng Baichuan has strictly supervised the farmers throughout the county to remove the rice roots. The general mobilization has been completed. On the 6th, the county government sent clerk Wang Guanchu, together with the district office, to various villages to urge the farmers to burn all the removed rice roots to prevent future troubles. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Water Police Request to Arrest Bandits</p>
<p>The detective team of the Second District of the Water Public Security Bureau recently captured seven bandits, including Hang Xiaoniu and Guan Ada, in Shengze Town, Wujiang County, and escorted them to the team headquarters for detailed interrogation. According to Hang Xiaoniu's confession, he had colluded with others to rob a certain family outside the North Gate of Huzhou, obtained stolen goods for use, and still had a pistol hidden in the wilderness outside Changxing County City, Zhejiang. Therefore, detective Yang Baokang was sent to escort the bandit to Changxing, and a pistol was indeed found in the wilderness. The team was brought back for verification, and the Second District of the Zhejiang Water Public Security Bureau specially requested that the seven criminals, including Hang Xiaoniu, be brought back to Zhejiang for interrogation.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Captures Stray Dogs</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau previously implemented the capture of stray dogs in order to rectify the city appearance. Later, because of the so-called Animal Protection Association, it interfered, so it was stopped. More than 800 stray dogs that had been captured were raised in the shelter. Now most of them have escaped. Recently, a new inspection team came to Suzhou to inspect and believed that stray dogs were everywhere in Suzhou and should be banned. Therefore, Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau decided to continue the capture. It is said that it will start on the 15th of this month, and the captured dogs will be executed by electric shock.</p>
<p>County Government Urges Dongting Landowners to Pay Land Tax</p>
<p>The county government believes that the land tax owed by the East and West Mountains of Dongting is very large and has repeatedly urged for payment. Because the landowners have no money to pay, there has been no effect. Yesterday, it specially issued a vernacular notice, ordering the heads of various villages and towns to pay first, and then ordering the landowners who serve as Baojia chiefs to clear the payment as an initiative for the farmers. The deadline is within April, and a portion must be paid first. Otherwise, the village and town heads who owe the tax will be detained.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Mass Schools Mostly Opened</p>
<p>Here, the masses are forced to learn to read, and more than 700 mass schools have been established, with the village and town heads and Baojia chiefs responsible for running them. More than 480 of them have been established, and they all opened on the 6th of this month. With 60 people per school, there should be more than 24,000 people engaged in literacy work. It is expected that the first phase will be completed in four months. This work is carried out at night, so it is easier for civilians to attend. The number of applicants is very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Urban Land Survey Completed</p>
<p>The urban land survey in this county began last month. The traverse survey has been completed. The Provincial Land Bureau has also transferred more than 20 land survey personnel who were originally working in Wuxian County to Wuxi to set up a group in Nanshi Qiaoxiang to implement household-by-household land survey. At the same time, the Provincial Bureau telegraphed the survey team leader Xue Gansheng to the province to discuss the concurrent handling of the mountainous land survey in this county. It has now begun, starting with the survey of the Xihui Mountains. There are a total of fifty to sixty surveyors. A separate office has been set up in Wanhuitang, Huishan. After the mountain survey is completed, other mountains will be surveyed.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Teachers Hold Graduation Exams</p>
<p>The graduating class of the Senior Normal School of the Provincial Taicang Normal School was originally scheduled to take the graduation exam in Suzhou. Later, the exam was ordered to be suspended. The school received a telegram from the Department of Education yesterday, stating that the graduation exam for the graduating class of the Senior Normal School will be held separately at each school from the 8th of this month, and will be completed on the 11th. The chief examiner will be appointed by the Department of Education and will depart on the morning of the 6th. The test questions will be formulated by each school with three cultivation topics, and the chief examiner will select and circle them. The test papers will be sealed and sent to the Department of Education to determine the ranking.</p>
<p>Passengers on Shatou Ferry Died Suddenly</p>
<p>The night ferry sailing between Shatou and Kunshan departed from Kunshan and returned to Shatou on the 5th. Two passengers who were selling piglets were on board. One got off the boat at Zhitang, and the other fell asleep. When the boat arrived in Shatou, it was already dawn. The boatman went forward to call him, but he was lying stiff and breathless. He immediately reported to the district office in charge and reported to the county government for examination. According to the boat owner, when the deceased disembarked in Kunshan, he was still carrying his bedding and there was nothing unusual. However, the two disembarked at the same time and were both pig merchants. One first got off the boat at Zhitang, and there seems to be something to investigate.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Party Affairs Office Ends</p>
<p>Zhang Gongren, a special commissioner of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, came to Tong to end the Fourth District Instructor's Office. On the 6th, he addressed the send-off ceremony, stating two hopes: 1. The persons in charge of the industrial and commercial circles should strive for improvement, have a broad vision, and must not stick to the same old ways. 2. Nantong is located at the intersection of the river and the sea. The national crisis is serious. Everyone should pay attention to physical education and quickly organize shooting associations.</p>
<p>Disappointed in Love, Sends Live Turtles to Vent Anger</p>
<p>The Criminal Court of the Nantong Court opened a trial on a romantic case on the 6th, presided over by Judge Sheng. Lu Shouren, an elementary school teacher, was disappointed in love with Jiang Xijue, a young girl. Jiang had married Shen Xiqi, a Shanghai businessman. Lu Shouren wrapped two live turtles in oilcloth and sent them to Shen Xiqi by post. Shen saw that the package was labeled as two boxes of perfume powder. When he opened it, they were two turtles. He sued Lu to the court. After verifying that the handwriting was correct, Lu was also detained for concealing an infant.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Wuqing Highway Begins Survey</p>
<p>The Department of Construction has started construction of the Jiangyin Qingyangzhen to Wujin highway. Because the deadline is very tight, the engineer Shen Xuepei was sent to Cheng to set up an office in the Qing six district office. He has begun surveying work.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Chief of Jia Robbed and Both Armpits Burned</p>
<p>At about 2:00 AM last night, more than a dozen bandits, each holding a box gun, wooden stick, multiple sharp weapons, and flashlights, broke into the home of Huang Eryin, the chief of the fourth Jia of the third Bao of Zhangzhuangzhen Houjiaxia in the second district of this county. First, they tied Huang tightly to the bed, searched for seven yuan in cash, five thousand copper coins, and multiple pieces of clothing and jewelry. They were still not satisfied. Then, they used reed firewood soaked in kerosene to burn Huang's armpits, forcing him to tell them where he hid the silver. Huang's armpits were burned, and he handed over ten yuan of hidden silver. Later, neighbors found out and rang the gong to gather the crowd. The bandits were afraid of being at a disadvantage and fled to the northeast with the stolen goods. At that time, dozens of villagers arrived, and seeing that the bandits were far away, they dispersed. Huang was severely injured after being burned and is feared to be in danger of life. The total loss is estimated to be about 300 yuan. The district office has been notified and the county government has been requested to arrest the bandits and investigate.</p>
<p>The Tragic Act of Digging Up and Burning a Child's Corpse</p>
<p>Zhu Yin, a resident of Caiyi Street in the North Gate of the city, and his wife are both in their thirties. They have had several children, but none have grown up. Two years ago, they had another son. In August of last year, when he was only a week old, he died suddenly and was buried near the North City. Yesterday (4th) at about 6:00 PM, Zhu suddenly hired someone to bring inflammable materials such as kerosene and firewood, and dug up the child's corpse, setting it on fire. In an instant, flames shot everywhere. The crowd suspected it was a fire alarm and there were many spectators. After an hour, the child's corpse was turned into ashes. According to superstitious people, the child born after this will not die young. This is extremely absurd.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Procuring Jiangxi Rice to Regulate the Food Supply</p>
<p>The Hangzhou authorities believe that the price of rice in the urban area has soared, and the livelihood of civilians has been greatly affected. In order to regulate the food supply, they have organized a grain investigation team to go to Jiangxi to investigate the rice production situation. They plan to purchase surplus rice from Jiangxi Province to regulate the food supply. However, because the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is used for transportation, the freight is expensive, costing 90 cents per bag. They have specially requested the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to find a way to reduce the freight to benefit the people's food supply. The railway has sent personnel to purchase freight vehicles and has allocated 25,000 yuan to build a warehouse. Zhang Zili, the secretary-general of the council, went to Shanghai on the 7th to meet with Hui Yangfu to ask for instructions on reducing the freight so that it can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Expanding the Area for Double-Cropping Rice</p>
<p>In the past, farmers in the Cixi double-cropping rice promotion area had shallow knowledge and were suspicious of the promotion, resulting in a shortfall from the planned promotion area. After the area sent personnel to convene farmers to talk and test the seeds, the results were satisfactory. Those who had not registered are now enthusiastically receiving the seeds. Now, including the original planned area, it has been expanded to more than 15,500 mu.</p>
<h3>The Social Basis of Fascism (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Joseph Barnes, translated by Bu Ren</p>
<p>Certainly, this petty bourgeoisie has organized intermittent resistance to the control of trust capital. It has attacked combines, just as the Luddite riots in England did a hundred years ago. It has organized various political revolutions under different forms of populist banners. The social and economic philosophy of Thomas Jefferson—perhaps the most complete and formulaic political expression representing the petty bourgeoisie—has never left American life. The American anti-monopoly movement, with its slogan of "Down with the trusts," laws against chain stores, the political tradition represented by Judge Brandeis, the idiom of "cursing the big capitalists," and the cooperative movement, all sufficiently prove the power of this tradition.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that after it overthrew feudalism, there have been few clear successes. The town merchant who bought property in "The Cherry Orchard" was already excluded by the lumber enterprises in Galilee before he could directly sell timber. The tremendous pressure of the machine age, tending towards unification, trustification, and large-scale production and distribution of goods, devastates the original interests of the middle class, just as it devastates the economic and social principles propagated by its leaders.</p>
<p>This fate has always been attached to the very structure of the so-called middle class. Its efforts to construct a rational and viable system have been hampered from the outset by the fact that its nature is neither the same as that of the trust bourgeoisie nor the same as that of the proletariat. It is a mixture of various elements, some of which are clearly in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>One result of this is that in the last eighty years, the middle class has played the difficult role of mediating between trust capital and the proletariat. This is a role that the landlord class of the old European feudal system successfully played for several years. Bismarck's economic laws, like Stolypin's economic laws in Russia, were clever schemes used by the remnants of the feudal aristocracy to restrain the predatory ambitions of the nouveau riche capitalist class. President Roosevelt, if he represented the weak American landowning aristocracy, could be in a similar position. However, it is much more reasonable to see most of the recovery plan as an effort by the American petty bourgeoisie to defend itself against organized labor on the one hand and rapacious financial capitalism on the other.</p>
<p>Until now, the middle class in democratic industrial countries has only succeeded in maintaining itself. Beyond that, it has had no success. In America, as in Western Europe, the odds are stacked in favor of trust monopolists. Financial and industrial concentration has only progressed and not regressed. The free competition in the open market assumed by Adam Smith remains, after more than two hundred years, nothing more than an assumption.</p>
<p>This is the social background that must be understood to clarify the rise of fascist groups in Western Europe. Whether in Italy or Germany, especially before the rise of fascism, fascists clearly and directly appealed to the middle class. They cursed the trade unions led by Moscow, cursed "international," "Jewish," or "large-scale" capital. Mussolini's Blackshirts found their earliest and greatest strength in the center of the peninsula, in the farmers between the southern and northern industrial areas, in regions where the petty bourgeoisie and tenant farmers predominated—these Italians were formed into the middle class by the constraints of tradition and material interests. In Germany, the situation was exactly the same. Individuals of various "forgotten" types of this class, whether urban or rural, Catholic or Protestant, sent Mussolini and Hitler to positions of power.</p>
<p>Once in power, the forgotten people were forgotten again. In Italy, the "end of the capitalist era" is still often heard in speeches, but the relative position of the middle class in the distribution of national wealth or income has not changed much, and large enterprises have continued to develop. Before 1933, National Socialists would smash the windows of department stores in Berlin; but since 1933, no specific laws have been enacted to help small merchants resist their large competitors. The middle-class movement under National Socialism has been stopped by its leaders because this movement has become a cause of displeasure to them.</p>
<p>Fascism initially appealed to the middle class to gain power, and then used that power for the benefit of large-scale monopoly interests. This contradiction inherent in fascism has two very different explanations. One is the fascists' own explanation. The other is the socialists' explanation.</p>
<p>From the fascists' point of view, the connection between the fascist state and private enterprise is only part of a larger concept. This is the corporate state. It endows the entire sacred concept of the state with an entity that transcends the interests of individuals and groups. It contains a demand for feelings of sacrifice, in that it clearly recognizes the need to temporarily suffer for the sake of the state. In addition, it contains a demand for long-term encouragement, in that it anticipates the glory of national victory that exceeds the reward of initial sacrifices. In Italy, this dismal management of the corporate state is considered an experiment; organizing corporations to peacefully integrate the separate interests of the masses is only a recent thing. A sympathetic writer explained it this way: "The separate contributions of each social class in the production process should be determined not only by their respective strengths, but also by harmony based on the principles of mutual understanding and equitable equality. This is the Fascist ideal."</p>

<h3>Aviation Youth Studying in France, Cao Shi, Returns to China and Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday. Claims French Air Force is Improving Daily. Will Report to Capital Before Returning to Hunan to Visit Relatives</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Mr. Cao Shiang, a young Chinese aviator who traveled abroad, a native of Hunan, went to France in 1930 and first entered the Paris Civil Aviation Academy. After graduating, he entered the Lyon National Military Aviation Academy in France, specializing in various subjects such as driving, manufacturing, repairing, and bombing techniques. During the Shanghai War in 1932, he returned to China to visit his relatives and was warmly welcomed by all sectors. Later, he was specially appointed by the French government as a member of the French Aeronautical Society and went to France. This spring, he was hired as an aviation instructor with the rank of colonel in the 35th Air Brigade. He has represented France in international aviation competitions and has received a military honor medal from the National Military Council. He is truly one of the outstanding talents among Chinese students studying aviation abroad.</p>
<p>Returned to China Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Cao recently became aware of the lack of aviation technicians in China, and because he had not returned to his homeland for several years, he was very unfamiliar with the situation in the country. Therefore, he decided to return to China. On the 3rd of last month, he left France from Marseilles on the French mail steamer General Xiafei and arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM yesterday. Those who went to the port to welcome him included representatives from the Hunan Provincial Government and Cao's relatives and friends Nie Haifan, Liu Guoxian, Cao Linchuan, Huang Gede, Liu Guoxing, Miss Wang Ke, and more than 30 foreign friends. The French military also specially dispatched two soldiers to escort Mr. Cao to China. After arriving at the port, he was accompanied by Nie Haifan and others to his residence to rest. In the evening at 7:00 PM, Nie held a welcoming dinner for Mr. Cao at the YMCA and invited relatives and friends to accompany him. The party broke up at about 9:00 PM. Mr. Cao plans to stay in Shanghai for a week. If he has the opportunity, he plans to demonstrate his flying skills in Shanghai, and then go to the capital to pay his respects to the authorities, make a report, and return to Hunan to visit his relatives.</p>
<p>Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency visited Mr. Cao at the YMCA. Through the introduction of Mr. Nie Haifan, he met the young aviator. Mr. Cao is of medium stature and was wearing a French military uniform. According to him, he went to study in France when he was 19 years old. French language is difficult to learn, and the cost of living is higher than in England, America, Italy, and other countries. An ordinary meal costs about two yuan in national currency, so life in France was quite hard. After being appointed as an aviation instructor, his monthly income was 500 yuan in national currency. This time, he originally planned to buy his own plane and fly back to China to fulfill his long-distance flying wish, but due to the tense situation in Europe, flying was inconvenient, so he returned by sea. The two soldiers sent by the French military to accompany him to China planned to return to France immediately because Mr. Cao's stay in China was uncertain. When asked about the tense relations between Germany and France, and what preparations the French government was making, he said that although he had been in France for a long time and worked in the military, he was very clear about it, but since it was an international issue, he would not elaborate.</p>
<p>French Air Force</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Cao said that the aircraft of the French Air Force are improving daily. The latest fighter aircraft can climb straight up to 6,000 meters, has 3,000 horsepower, can carry seven people and a huge amount of 500 pounds of bombs, and three twin machine guns. The most peculiar thing is that there is a camera installed on the head of the machine gun. The direction in which the bullets are fired, how the enemy plane is hit, and how the fuselage is destroyed can all be captured on camera. French aviation training is quite expensive. Military aircraft cost 230 yuan per hour to teach, while civilian aircraft cost 70 yuan per hour. Speaking of personal life, he said that he does not drink or smoke and is not engaged.</p>
<h3>US Agricultural Expert Haas Arrives in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>His stay in China is set at ten months, researching various agricultural products</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Ministry of Industry believes that the yields of China's main agricultural products, such as rice, wheat, and cotton, have declined in recent years, which are insufficient to meet the needs of the country, resulting in a large amount of imported grain, rice, and cotton. In order to achieve self-sufficiency, a rice and wheat improvement institute has been established, and rice and wheat improvement areas have been established in various provinces to engage in planting research to increase yields and meet supply. At the same time, in view of the recent rapid progress of various agricultural products in the United States, Mr. Haas, an American agricultural expert, was specially invited to China to serve as a guide. After accepting the invitation, Mr. Haas arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday on the Russian Empress, which he boarded last month.</p>
<p>Researching Agricultural Products</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Haas, accompanied by Pan Shangliang, Ph.D., a representative of the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute of the Ministry of Industry, visited various construction projects throughout the city yesterday, and will visit academic institutions such as the International Trade Bureau Commodity Inspection Bureau and Jiaotong University. He is scheduled to go to the capital in the coming days to take up his post. According to Mr. Haas yesterday, this is his first time in China, so he intends to visit various places when he has the opportunity to understand the agricultural situation. His stay in China is scheduled for ten months, and the main research objects are rice, wheat, cotton, and tobacco, so as to improve them.</p>
<p>Sons Travel</p>
<p>Mr. Haas's two sons and one daughter plan to travel to various countries after leaving the United States this time. In China, they will travel to major cities such as South China, North China, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Hangzhou. Their stay in China is set at three months. In July of this year, they will leave China for countries such as England, Germany, France, and Japan, and then return to the United States.</p>
<h3>Klopp Quietly Goes to Japan</h3>
<p>His departure was quite secretive, and he will return to Shanghai soon</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. and Mrs. Klopp, the head of the German Far East Economic Investigation Group, left Shanghai on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada the night before last to go to Japan. Mr. Klopp's whereabouts were quite secretive. Before his departure, he spoke to reporters on the phone, denying the rumors that he was going to the Northeast and saying that the date of his departure from Shanghai had not yet been determined. He also said that it was not certain whether he would go to Japan. Unexpectedly, less than two days later, Mr. Klopp had quietly left. It is said that Mr. Klopp's task on this trip to Japan is to sign a contract between Germany, Japan, and Manchukuo for the exchange of machinery and soybeans. According to Mr. Klopp before his departure, he told people in the hostel that his trip would be very short and that he would return to Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Regulations Promulgated by the Ministry of Industry Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th. The Ministry of Industry announced the Shanghai Fish Market Regulations on the 7th, totaling nine chapters and forty-nine articles. The regulations stipulate that the share capital is 1.2 million yuan, divided into 12,000 shares, each share being 100 yuan in national currency, with official and commercial shares being half each. If the commercial shares are insufficient, they will be temporarily advanced by the government and sold successively, but the commercial shares must be paid at least 300,000 yuan first. As for the organization of the market, there will be eleven directors, and the Ministry of Industry will designate one of the standing directors as the chairman. There will be five supervisors, who will elect one person as the resident supervisor. There will also be a general manager and one or two deputy managers. The market will operate on the basis of public auctions and gradually reduce commissions to reduce the burden on fish merchants and fishermen. The shares can now be collected in full, and the shareholders' meeting will be held in Shanghai on the 9th. Wu Dingchang will go to Shanghai on the 8th to participate, and the opening ceremony can be held on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Tricolor Ship on Fire, Shanghai Office Inquires About Truth</h3>
<p>The William Bubor Line, managed by the local Tianxiang Shipping Company, has built several ships with the character "Tai" in the Far East Line in New York, namely the Taiping, Pacific, Taiyin, and Taiyang. Each ship is an express class. From Shanghai to New York, crossing the Pacific Ocean and passing through Panama, it takes only 37 days, which is the fastest ship in Shanghai, so the business is excellent. There is a departure every four weeks. The schedule was originally for the Taiyin, but due to major repairs in the dock, the line changed the ship and sent the Tricolor to China for the first time. It departed from Shanghai on March 23.</p>
<p>Large Amount of Goods Transported</p>
<p>The Tricolor originally sailed in the Atlantic Ocean. The ship is in excellent condition, has strong speed, and has passenger seats. This time, it returned to the United States from the Far East, carrying a large amount of cargo, originally 11,700 tons. Later, due to the shortage of 700 tons of tung oil in Shanghai, it could not be loaded on the ship. Therefore, it transported a total of 11,000 tons of export goods from the ports of Little Luzon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Japan, including wood, brown rope, cotton, silk waste, and wool. The ship was fully loaded with goods in each cabin. Most of the passengers disembarked in Luzon, and only two people disembarked in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Cause of Fire</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper went to the Tianxiang Shipping Company to ask its person in charge. According to him, Shanghai had not received a telegram after the Tricolor departed, because it was safe along the way. It was not until yesterday that the company learned from the newspaper that the ship had been burned. However, there has been no telegram from the voyage, probably because it is far from Shanghai and close to the United States, so the news was not sent to Shanghai. It is presumed that the cause of the fire started from the cotton, because the fire started in the fifth cabin, which contained cotton, and cotton is the most flammable.</p>
<p>All Shanghai Goods Lost</p>
<p>The goods from Shanghai were all loaded in the fifth cabin and on the deck, so they were the first to bear the brunt. According to reliable news received in Shanghai yesterday, 150 of the 500 bales of cotton have been burned (the remaining 350 bales are also unlikely to be salvaged), 137 bales of wool, 400 bales of walnuts, 30 bales of silk waste, 17 bales of pig bristles, and dozens of other sundry goods. Once ignited, it turned into a prairie fire, and all were scorched earth. The magnitude of the loss cannot be counted.</p>
<p>Inquiring About the Truth</p>
<p>The location of the fire is said to be about 1,000 nautical miles away from Yokohama, Japan, and has not yet reached Honolulu. The ship will now be stranded on the north Pacific coast. Tianxiang telegraphed the United States yesterday to inquire about the truth. The ship was originally scheduled to sail two trips to China. The second trip was scheduled to depart from Shanghai on August 21, but now another ship will be sent. The shipowner is Norwegian, named Torvtoft. Captain Taft has just been transferred from Hong Kong to the ship.</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Jiuyushan, 6th. Last Saturday, after the Baber Qian Line's Tricolor steamship caught fire, all thirteen passengers were transported to other ships by lifeboat, but there were still 45 sailors on board who are now trying their best to put out the fire. However, the fire is getting worse day by day. The ship is now in the waters 500 miles northwest of Midway Island, trying to reach Honolulu. However, according to a telegram from the Dollar Line's President Grant, the fire on the ship is fierce and the voyage is very slow.</p>
<h3>Sichuan River Water Rises, Vessel Navigation Opens. Direct Shipping from Shanghai to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Freight Transportation Begins Today, Totaling Three Vessels Upstream</p>
<p>The Sichuan River waterway has been shallow this year. In the Yichang area, the shallowest water level is only one inch above the bottom, causing merchant vessels from China, Britain, Italy, France, and Japan navigating the Sichuan River to suspend navigation. Although the water level has risen slightly since then, it is still only possible to navigate shallow-water passenger ships and cannot transport cargo through Yichang. In fact, Sichuan River cargo transportation has not been possible. It was not until the 4th of this month that the Sanbei Company received a telegram from Yichang stating that the Sichuan River water had risen, with the highest point being 2 feet 8 inches to 3 feet or more (excluding the bottom). It is estimated that on the 6th of this month, it will be possible to transport cargo through the shallow areas above Yichang. Jardine Matheson and Nissin and others also received news of the rising water. Therefore, they urgently dispatched the Jiahe (Jardine Matheson) and Changyang Maru (Nissin) vessels. The Jufu Company also sent the Fuyuan vessel to transport Sichuan cargo from Shanghai directly to Chongqing today. This is the first time since the Sichuan River water has been shallow and navigation has been interrupted that Shanghai has directly shipped fully loaded cargo into Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Sino-French Vietnam Telegraph Agreement Initialed, Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in order to develop international telecommunications business, previously sent Zhao Yilin, the current director of the International Telephone and Telegraph Fee Accounting Office, to Annam to negotiate and sign a telegraph agreement between China, France, and Vietnam with the French authorities. A reporter from the Central News Agency asked Zhao about this matter. According to him, an initial draft of the telegraph agreement between China, France, and Vietnam has been signed and is now being submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. After approval, it will be formally signed. As for the content of the draft, it only contains an outline, which is drafted based on the International Telecommunication Convention. It will be supplemented through consultation when it is formally signed in the future.</p>
<h3>General Federation of Industry to Establish Branches in Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Implementing Industrial and Commercial Economic Ties Between Shanghai and Guangdong</p>
<p>The Chinese General Federation of Industry, in view of the abundance of products and rapid construction in Guangdong and Guangxi, previously formed a Guangdong and Guangxi Industrial Investigation Group to investigate the actual situation in important cities and towns in Guangdong and Guangxi in order to understand the local demand and supply situation. Now that the group has completed its work and returned, it has a deep understanding of the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi. In order to establish economic ties between Shanghai and Guangdong and promote production and sales cooperation, it is planned to further establish industrial and joint branches in important cities and towns in Guangdong and Guangxi to implement industrial and commercial economic ties between Shanghai and Guangdong, so as to develop national products. In addition to the active progress of the General Federation in Shanghai, all the tasks in Guangdong and Guangxi will be carried out by Wang Zhisheng, the secretary-general of the federation. It is expected that the branches there will be established soon. It is heard that Secretary-General Wang Zhisheng will return to Shanghai on the Dollar Line's President Lincoln on the 8th to report on the results of the negotiations. The general manager of the federation, Qian Chengxu, will depart at the end of this month to make arrangements.</p>
<h3>Loan Association and Qianye Prepare to Weather the Fourth Quarter Difficulty, the Central Bank and Three Other Banks will Expand Interbank Lending, the Qianye Association Schedules Internal Board Meetings</h3>
<p>According to Shiye News Agency, the four periodic account settlements, which Shanghai industry and commerce must go through every year in the fourth quarter, fifth quarter, tenth quarter, and year-end, are extraordinary periods of financial emergency for the city. We are now less than three weeks away from the fourth quarter, and most industries are already planning and fully preparing. According to the reporter's investigation, most banks and money shops can make a profit due to recent business development. Although the sales of silk and rubber have been affected, the profits are still substantial. Due to the increase in chips on the market and the activity in finance, the silk, satin, and tea industries are quite optimistic. Due to the bumper harvests in rural areas last year, the purchasing power of the people has increased, and sales are gradually booming in industries such as yarn, flower, rice, wheat, flour, grain, and cotton cloth. The import and export industries and various commercial firms have the most profits in non-ferrous metals, mineral sands, and pigments. Other commodities are also showing signs of recovery. It is hoped that the fourth quarter difficulty can be weathered steadily.</p>
<p>The Committee Lends as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee, because the Ministry of Finance approved the request of industry leaders last year, ordered each bank to identify 4.75 million yuan and each Qianye shop to identify 250,000 yuan, totaling 5 million yuan. After hiring industry giants to organize and establish before the fourth quarter, they immediately complied with the order to handle credit small loans for each industry to provide working capital. By the end of last month, more than 1.7 million yuan had been loaned out, the work was smooth, and the results were outstanding. The committee, in view of the financial storm that occurred in Shanghai in the fourth quarter of last year, has now decided to grant as many loans as possible before the fourth quarter of this year in order to thoroughly relieve the market, with a view to supporting industry and commerce and increasing work efficiency. It is heard that the number of industries applying for loans to the committee these days is much more enthusiastic than in the past. The committee will soon hold a meeting to review and approve loans. It is expected that the market's finances will be loosened after this.</p>
<p>Expand Lending and Overdrafts</p>
<p>Since the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in this city concentrated 20 million yuan to carry out interbank lending at the time of the year-end closing of each industry last year, the financial industry has benefited a lot. Because the industrial and commercial fourth quarter is approaching, the expansion of this lending business has been carefully considered to help maintain the serious difficulties of future work. As for other banks, in addition to preparing work early and strengthening their own foundations, they have also actively handled current credit overdraft loans to provide relief to the market. Considerable plans have also been decided for various mortgage and goods loans.</p>
<p>Qianye will Discuss the Internal Board</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the 49 member shops of the Qianye Association have been deeply wary of their own preparations since the storm that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year, they have all followed the instructions of the Qianye Supervisory Committee. There should be no problems in the fourth quarter of this year. Yesterday, a Shiye News Agency reporter inquired from Qianye that each shop had made sufficient preparations for the fourth quarter. For all long-term loans, where the other party has excellent credit, an extension of the interest payment will be approved as much as possible. The fourth quarter "internal board" meeting is scheduled to be held at the same time as the executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month. These days, the revenue and expenses of each shop are not very busy. Yesterday afternoon in the Qianye market, the foreign exchange rate was stable at eight cents due to the lack of demand from all parties, that is, eight cents of interest per thousand yuan per day. It is heard that the foreign exchange rate is likely to increase step by step after this.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau – Promoting International Trade</h3>
<p>Connecting with Commercial Officers of Various Consulates – Assigning Dedicated Personnel for Liaison</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has spared no effort in promoting international trade. Each month, it receives over a hundred inquiries from Chinese and foreign consulates and merchants seeking commercial information and requesting introductions for trade correspondence. Recently, to enhance work efficiency, the bureau has established close connections with the commercial counselors' offices of various consulates in Shanghai and foreign chambers of commerce. Henceforth, if Chinese merchants have any correspondence related to import and export business as mentioned above, please indicate "Guidance Division" on the envelope so that the division can respond promptly upon receipt. To facilitate communication between Chinese and foreign parties, the bureau has assigned Mr. Huang Dingxun as a dedicated officer to handle all liaison matters with consulates. It is reported that commercial officers from various countries are willing to fully cooperate.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings Bureau Absorbing Savings – Deciding on Three Principles</h3>
<p>Simultaneous Emphasis on Safety, Liquidity, and High Interest – National Savings Reaching 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Da Kung She, postal savings were first established in the eighth year of the Republic (1919), managed concurrently by post offices. In the nineteenth year of the Republic (1930), the system was slightly changed, with the savings and remittance sections being separated and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau established to handle savings and remittance businesses. Over the years, the public, recognizing the security and reliability of this form of savings, and that it is managed by the state, unlike ordinary commercial savings banks, has increased their savings accounts year by year. The minimum deposit for opening an account is one yuan, and the maximum limit is three thousand yuan for individuals and four thousand yuan for organizations. Over seven hundred postal districts nationwide handle savings. According to the bureau's recent statistics, there are over two hundred thousand savings account holders, with total savings reaching over fifty million yuan.</p>
<p>Three Investment Principles</p>
<p>According to Zhang Liangwu, the director of the Savings Department, postal savings have been established for many years and have a considerable history. Due to the limitations on the amount of savings, deposits have only reached over fifty million yuan. This is because large depositors tend to deposit and withdraw funds frequently, which is not in line with the purpose of savings. Postal services cannot utilize these funds, which would hinder the interests of small depositors. In the past, many commercial banks that faced economic stagnation were mostly affected by large depositors. If postal savings did not limit the amount of savings and accepted as much as possible, the savings could reach tens of millions. Therefore, the difference between postal savings and commercial savings lies in this aspect. Currently, the purpose of postal savings is to utilize funds and make reliable investments to protect the interests of depositors, thereby encouraging savings. Therefore, the bureau has recently decided on the following principles for savings investment methods: 1. Safety and reliability; 2. Capital liquidity; 3. Favorable interest rates. These three major principles will be implemented simultaneously to avoid speculative investments, ensure the benefits of postal savings, and promote the prosperity of the national economy. This is the mission and responsibility of the bureau.</p>
<p>International Remittance Business</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau handled international remittances. In the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), remittances totaled 1,518,880.55 yuan, and payments totaled 1,930,846.25 yuan. In the twenty-third year (1934), remittances totaled 1,582,190.09 yuan, and payments totaled 2,328,897.36 yuan. In the first half of the twenty-fourth year (1935) (from July to December), remittances totaled 700,671 yuan, and payments totaled 1,285,309 yuan. Currently, the domestic postal remittance area has been expanded by the Ministry of Communications to over 170 locations, allowing direct remittances with over 20 countries, including England, France, the United States, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Poland, Denmark, and India. It is expected that the amount of international remittances in the second half of the year will increase significantly.</p>
<h3>Telephone Problem Committee – Protesting Telephone Rate Increases</h3>
<p>Suggesting the Ratepayers Association Submit to the General Meeting for Discussion – Also Writing to Various Organizations to Lead the Protest Jointly</p>
<p>According to the Da Kung She, the Special District Telephone Problem Committee, after a routine meeting the other day, decided to expand its internal organization for long-term protest and appointed eleven organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as standing directors responsible for leading all users in the city to fight together. The committee also intends to draft protest measures and yesterday sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession, requesting that it be submitted to the Ratepayers' Representative Assembly on the 15th of this month for discussion. It also sent separate letters to the trade associations and the Citizens' Federation, requesting that they uniformly follow the telephone measures discussed by the committee in order to achieve victory. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Protest</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee yesterday sent letters to eleven organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, the Citizens' Federation of various districts, the Lawyers' Association, the Accountants' Association, the Journalists' Association, the Brokers' Association of the Five Exchanges, the Ningbo Native Place Association, the Pudong Native Place Association, and the Guangdong Native Place Association, requesting them to serve as standing directors and lead the protest. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, our committee was established by various public organizations in the city and has been in existence for two months. Regarding the issue of Shanghai Telephone Company's rate increase, despite repeated appeals, the company is blinded by profit and disregards public opinion, resulting in the protest not being resolved to this day. With the approach of March telephone bills, users are sending inquiries in droves. Our committee feels that without concrete action, it cannot prompt the company to reflect. The sixth board of directors meeting decided to establish a standing board of directors to handle daily affairs and lead users to protest jointly. Therefore, we hereby send this letter, requesting that you immediately send the name of a representative to the committee so that we can hold a meeting on a regular basis. This matter concerns all citizens, so please do not neglect it."</p>
<p>Suggestion to the General Meeting</p>
<p>The 15th session of the World Taxpayers' Association Representative Assembly will be held on the 15th of this month. The committee yesterday drafted opinions against the telephone rate increase and requested that they be submitted to the Representative Assembly for discussion. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, regarding the issue of the Shanghai Telephone Company's rate increase, which your association will submit to the Taxpayers' Representative Assembly for discussion, our association hereby submits the following opinions for consideration by the General Meeting: 1. Acknowledge the Shanghai Telephone Company's decision to charge, but charge three cents for both basic and excess calls; 2. Each telephone must be equipped with a meter (as some users have recently reported inaccurate counting by the company) and must be installed within three months; 3. Question the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council regarding the approval of rate increases for public utilities, which should not be handled unilaterally; 4. Send a letter to the Municipal Council, ordering the company to reduce expenses and not arbitrarily increase the burden on citizens; 5. If the company does not accept the three-cent per call calculation, telephone fees will be remitted to the Municipal Council for payment, and the Municipal Council shall be responsible for any line breaks or accidents; 6. The Ratepayers' Association shall be responsible for leading users in various districts to organize a telephone users' association to facilitate command and joint protest. The above suggestions are feasible, and we hope that they will be submitted to the General Meeting for discussion, for the public good."</p>
<p>Consistent Action</p>
<p>The committee yesterday also sent separate letters to the trade associations and the Citizens' Federation of various districts, requesting that they uniformly transfer the resolutions of the committee to all members for joint compliance and consistent action. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, our association was established to protest the telephone rate increase, so its strength depends entirely on the support and cooperation of various public organizations. Currently, the Shanghai Telephone Company has refused to consider our association's suggestions for reducing telephone rates, resulting in the appeals not being resolved to this day. To prepare for long-term protest, we have strengthened our internal organization. Hereafter, all righteous actions of our association, which concern the interests of all users, must be uniformly notified and complied with to prompt the company to reflect. In addition to temporarily copying and announcing the resolutions, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will take note and act accordingly. Best regards to all organizations."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry – Establishing a Commodity Inspection Branch in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Dispatching Zhang Weiru, Technical Expert from Shanghai Bureau, as Director – Officially Established on the 5th, Inspection to Commence on the 15th</p>
<p>Chongqing, located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, is a central hub for the export of Sichuan native products, such as tung oil, bristles, and cow and sheep hides, which are concentrated there for transportation and re-export in large quantities. However, the quality varies, hindering the development of Sichuan's native product exports. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Industry has established a commodity inspection branch of the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau in Chongqing, dispatching Zhang Weiru, the head of the Chemical Products Inspection Group of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, as the director of the branch.

<h3>Ma Hongkui Comes to Shanghai to Discuss – Promoting Sales of Domestic Goods in the Border Regions – Zou Fanwen Hosts Banquet Yesterday Noon</h3>
<p>According to the Bao Ye She, Ma Hongkui, the chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government, is very enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods. He decided to take the opportunity of coming to Shanghai to contact the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association to hold a large-scale National Goods Exhibition during the province's annual gathering this year to awaken the border province's public awareness of domestic goods. The association entrusted Zou Fanwen and Sheng Wen to contact Wang Xingyao of the Production and Sales Association to discuss the plan. Yesterday noon, Zou hosted a banquet for Chairman Ma and people from the Shanghai domestic goods industry at the Snow Garden on Jing'an Temple Road. Chairman Ma, Fang Yexian, Wang Xingyao, Xiang Kangyuan, Wang Yansong, Wu Huanru, Fang Jiangge, Ye Youwan, and dozens of others attended.

<h3>Wang Fu Nail Factory Experiences Labor Dispute – Caused by Factory Increasing Working Hours</h3>
<p>According to the Da Kung She, the Wang Fu Domestic Goods Nail Factory on Pinlang Road in West Shanghai has been open for three years and its business is quite developed, employing more than 100 workers. The factory is divided into day and night shifts, and the shifts are changed every 15 days. Recently, the factory suddenly increased the working hours of workers on the night shift to 12 hours, and added six more hours of work to each worker when changing shifts. Those who did not obey would have their wages deducted. Therefore, all the workers found it difficult to accept, and sent representatives to request the factory to change this policy, but they were rejected and the representatives were dismissed. This aroused public outrage, and the workers went on strike at 6:00 PM yesterday. Currently, because the workers do not have a union, they have automatically jointly petitioned the municipal party and government agencies for assistance.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Petitions Executive Yuan – To Return Wang Bin Yan's Military Advance Payments – Please Forward Order to the Ministry of Finance for Repayment to Avoid Burden</h3>
<p>According to the Da Kung She, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city presented a petition to the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting that the Ministry of Finance be ordered to return the military advance payments handled by Wang Bin Yan, so as to avoid being burdened. The original presentation states: "This presentation is for requesting the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to return the military advance payments handled by Shanghai gentleman Wang Bin Yan, so as to avoid being burdened due to public service. It is based on the report of the 16th District Branch, which states that Wang Bin Yan, a gentleman from Zhabei, is enthusiastic about public welfare, cares for the local area, and has a benevolent style that is admirable. In the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, the troops retreated to Zhabei. In order to raise funds for military use and handle local relief matters, he mortgaged his private houses and properties to banks and money houses for huge amounts of money to meet the needs of the time. Now, Guangdong Bank and others, as creditors, are pursuing debts in court. On March 23, the court sealed Wang's residence. It is found that the money borrowed was indeed used for military purposes and to protect the local area, and at that time the government promised to repay it, which is on record, and there is no obligation to have individuals bear the burden. Now, Wang is suffering the consequences of being homeless because of his love for the local area. Not only is Mr. Wang personally suffering injustice, but those who act righteously and bravely will be deterred. This case is of great importance. We urge your association to lead the citizens to uphold justice for Mr. Wang's burden due to public service and request that you present a petition to the Ministry of Finance immediately to have the military advance payments repaid as soon as possible in order to clear the litigation. The association submitted it to the 17th Executive Committee meeting, which recognized that the allegations were true and presented the petition to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Ministry of Finance approve the repayment of the military advance payments handled by Mr. Wang to avoid burden and benefit public opinion. Respectfully presented to Jiang, the President of the Executive Yuan."</p>
<h3>Xinwei Relief Association – Yesterday Sent a Large Number of Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>

<h3>Overview of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association – A New Hospital Added in the Western District – Self-Management of Rickshaw Pullers' Insurance</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association held its 28th board meeting at the Western District Hall the other day. At the same time, the association had just established a new hospital in the Western District Hall with 12 beds, so the board members inspected the hospital at the beginning of the meeting. Then, they convened a meeting to discuss the work reports of various departments. According to the association's statistics for February, various association affairs related to the interests of rickshaw pullers have become increasingly developed compared to the previous month. Noteworthy aspects include: the number of consultations at the clinic in February reached more than 19,000, exceeding the previous month by more than 3,300; relief matters also increased from 1,848 cases in the previous month to 2,551 cases; in terms of donations, the association's various district halls received a total of nine plaques donated by rickshaw pullers, all of which were automatic expressions of gratitude from the beneficiary rickshaw pullers. In addition, Mr. Jin Fusu, the chief doctor of the Mutual Aid Association, donated a complete set of 12 hospital beds to the Western District Hall Hospital, and other benefactors donated tea cans and 25 yuan in cash, all of which have been gratefully acknowledged by the association. According to the report of the association's Labour Affairs Committee, it has been decided to purchase two public cemetery sites, each of five or six mu, in both the South Shanghai and North Shanghai areas, and build a tomb house on each site for burial and sacrifice purposes. In addition, it is planned to open a rickshaw pullers' savings bank, which has been approved in principle, but the details have not yet been drafted and will be reported later. Furthermore, the Medical Committee plans to add two doctors to meet the needs of rickshaw pullers who are seriously ill and need home visits, and also needs to add one nurse and one obstetric nurse to provide timely consultations to the families of rickshaw pullers. In addition, the Insurance Committee has also drafted an insurance plan for rickshaw pullers, deciding to manage it themselves. The Management Committee will first withdraw 30,000 yuan and deposit it into the bank's insurance account, and another insurance board of directors will be established, with all members of the existing Insurance Committee and one member of the Management Committee in charge of its incoming and outgoing funds. As for the original plan, major insurance companies in this city had previously issued insurance premium price lists, but after review by the committee, it was felt that the premiums quoted exceeded the mortality rate statistics of those companies. Rickshaw pullers are hard-working labourers, and the premiums should be reduced as much as possible. Moreover, the Mutual Aid Association itself has considerable accumulated funds, so self-insurance is more economical and reasonable. Therefore, the Insurance Committee's self-insurance plan was also approved by the board of directors. In addition, regarding the continued registration and licensing of rickshaw pullers, once the Municipal Council makes a decision, the license fees for all new rickshaw pullers will be paid by the Mutual Aid Association.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, when the rickshaw owners stopped operating, the Mutual Aid Association's board of directors convened a special meeting and resolved to provide relief funds of 30 cents of the silver dollar to each unemployed rickshaw puller every two days during the rickshaw owners' strike period. The association immediately made every effort to prepare for the issuance of the relief funds and decided to choose three locations far from each other in the northern district as the distribution points for the relief funds. However, the rickshaw owners' strike broke down on the evening of the third day, so the relief plan was terminated.</p>

<h3>Zhou's Civil Case Withdrawn Voluntarily</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinxiu Realizes She Was Wrong</p>
<p>Zhou Wumin, a Ningbo person engaged in the insurance business, was accused by his former maid Zhang Jinxiu of offenses against morals and forgery. When the court opened the trial previously, because public attendance was prohibited, the previous reports were quite vague. It is now known that Ms. Zhang was employed as a maid in Zhou's family for more than two years. At the beginning, her service was diligent and she gained the trust of her employer. However, on the night of January 19th of this year, she secretly hid Mrs. Zhou Hu's gold necklace in her pocket. She was then searched and scolded by Mrs. Hu. Feeling ashamed, she resigned the next day. More than a month later, the woman suddenly sent a letter from a lawyer to Zhou Shimin, asking how he would deal with her impending childbirth. Zhou realized that she wanted to take the opportunity to defraud him, so he ignored her. Thereupon, Ms. Zhang filed a criminal lawsuit against Zhou in the First Special Court, and Zhou also hired a lawyer to defend himself, saying that since the plaintiff was pregnant, after she gave birth, the fetus could be examined according to law, and it would not be difficult to clarify who the child belonged to. The allegation of abandonment would also be easily resolved, and the allegation of forgery was even more groundless. Since the first trial, Ms. Zhang has been willing to reconcile. Zhou's relatives and friends were asked to mediate. As a result, Zhang Jinxiu signed an agreement with Zhou and applied to the court to withdraw the lawsuit. The declaration signed by her stated: "Zhang Jinxiu is aware that the self-sought case against Zhou Shimin is unjustified. She is willing to withdraw the self-sought part of this case and abandon all rights of appeal, and will never cause further disputes. As for the non-self-sought part of this case, Zhang Jinxiu will no longer make any claims. To have evidence for future use, this declaration is made for record." Therefore, when the court continued the trial the day before yesterday afternoon, the lawyers of both parties appeared in court to explain the reconciliation process. Judge Jiang approved the withdrawal of the self-sought case.</p>
<h3>Song Guozhen Commits Suicide Due to Economic Hardship</h3>
<p>Song Guozhen, a native of Suzhou, aged twenty-six, was working at Yishun and Box Making Shop in Laobeimen Nei Xuenongdi, within the city. Recently, due to economic hardship, he suddenly conceived the idea of death. Yesterday afternoon at 1:40 PM, he went to the Yong'an Hotel in the French Concession and booked room number unknown. Shortly after, he secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide. Later, the poison took effect and became uncontrollable. The tea boy discovered him and rushed him to Renji Hospital in a car. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6:10 PM. Before the incident, he had written a suicide note to his sister at the Xinyi Pharmacy on Route Massenet, stating that he suffered from economic pain in the world and thought it was better to die.</p>
<h3>Private Possession of Firearms: Three-Month Sentences</h3>
<p>Hua Youshan and Chen Dabao, Chinese detectives of the Hongkou Police Station, acting on intelligence, at 4:50 AM on the 26th of last month, discovered that someone was privately storing firearms in Room 22 of the Xi'an Hotel at No. 98 Xi'an Road, plotting illegal activities. They secretly went to the address and arrested two men from Tongzhou, Zhu Jinyu and Wang Zilin, in the room. They found a real and a fake pistol under the pillow. They were sent to the First Special Court. According to the defendants Zhu and Wang, they were invited to talk by Wang Xiaosanzi, who is at large, and the guns were hidden by him, intending to rob an unknown property. They claimed to have been deceived and sought leniency. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody to await judgment. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the court and sentenced Zhu Jinyu and Wang Zilin to three months of imprisonment each, and confiscated the real and fake pistols.</p>
<h3>Liu Chunshan, Leader of Comedians, Uses Radio to Solicit Aviation Donations</h3>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Solicitation Office of the China Aviation Association previously received a report from Liu Chunshan, a leader of comedians in this city, stating that radio listeners were very willing to donate to the Aviation National Salvation Fund and purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations. He proposed to collect and remit the donations on their behalf. The office immediately appointed him as the captain of the 471st Solicitation Team and requested him to make great efforts.

<h3>Shanghai Birth Control Association Invites Mrs. Martin to Speak Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Global Food Supply Can Support 5 Billion People, Half the Population Already Exists</h3>
<h3>With the Advancement of Science and Elimination of War, Birth Control is Essential</h3>
<p>Mrs. Martin, a British expert in promoting birth control, arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, at the invitation of the Shanghai Birth Control Association, she gave her first speech at the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association at No. 999 Jing'an Temple Road. The topic of the speech was "Population Problems and Birth Control." Despite the rain, over a hundred Chinese and foreign men and women attended. Chairman Liu Wang Liming presided. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Past Work of the Shanghai Birth Control Association</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Wang Liming first stood up to introduce, stating that this lecture was the first public lecture of the Shanghai Birth Control Association. The Shanghai Birth Control Association was established ten years ago. Its motivation is to create an excellent nation, establish happy families, and realize a bright society for the country. It also aims to reduce the economic burden on parents, reduce pain from diseases, and eliminate worries about having too many children. For children, it aims to provide healthy bodies, beautiful lives, and thorough nurturing. It is a great humanitarian movement. The ten years can be divided into two stages. The first half was initiated by Dr. Yan Fuqing and others, focusing on research work. Two years ago, Zhou Zhonghuiqing, who was studying birth control issues in the United States, returned to China and joined the association to assist. Therefore, the association's work has moved from the research stage to the implementation stage. Through the efforts of the association, three birth control clinics have been established: at Guangren Hospital on Avenue Edward VII, at the Women and Children's Hospital in Ximen, and at the Chinese Red Cross Hospital on Route Haig. These clinics provide consultation and guidance for those who wish to practice birth control. Also, in the past, birth control was almost exclusively enjoyed by the upper and middle classes. The association has now started to promote and guide birth control in civilian communities such as civilian new villages and rickshaw driver unions, so that it can be universally practiced. She then introduced Mrs. Martin, stating that Mrs. Martin had given 45 speeches in India, 6 in Guangdong, and many in Hong Kong. She has special research on birth control.</p>
<p>Speech Begins with Emphasis on Production</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin then began her speech, stating that the topic was "Population Problems and Birth Control." Currently, all countries in the world are paying attention to the population problem. However, some national leaders are exclusively encouraging childbirth. According to research results from British and American experts, the world can still support 5 billion people, so it seems to be a less important issue. However, no matter which country, if it cannot provide its people with a comfortable life, it should promote birth control. Encouraging childbirth should depend on the ability of the producers.</p>
<p>Production Should Depend on Economic Circumstances</p>
<p>"Birth Control" was promoted by Mrs. Sanger in the United States in 1914, as a new term, but it is actually an old problem. If we look at it from a historical perspective, couples have always been burdened by having too many children. Although there were birth control methods at the time, they were very cruel. Now, with the advancement of science, there is no problem. The meaning of birth control is not "not wanting children," but "producing according to our needs." That is, we should produce the number of children that our economic situation can support. Birth control is not abortion. Physiologically speaking, abortion is after the fetus has been formed, while birth control is before the fetus has been formed, so there is no sin.</p>
<p>Ideal Marriage Problems</p>
<p>Today, I will only talk about family population issues. Marriage is not for the purpose of having children. Young men and women want to be permanent friends because of career, love, and other factors. After marriage, having one child is very happy. The second child is also happy, but after two or three years, having another child is still pleasant, but also hard work. Year after year, the happy and beautiful girl has changed into an old mother. In our ideal marriage, young people should be examined by a doctor before marriage. This is very important because it judges whether they are qualified to be parents, just like testing soldiers for combat effectiveness in wartime. If a woman has already had a child after marriage, she will gain a lot from going to a birth control guidance center. Once guided, she can no longer fear having a second child. It can make the first child receive good nurturing. The personal care that babies receive from their mothers in the first one or two years will greatly benefit their lives. The fact that there are fewer stillborn children compared to younger siblings is proof.</p>
<p>Birth Control Allows Women to Rest</p>
<p>Physiologically and medically, women should have a period of rest after giving birth. However, those who oppose birth control say that couples should stop sexual life during this period of rest. However, according to a famous British doctor, this move would destroy the relationship between the couple, which is not as good as birth control. The number of children a family needs should be determined by economic circumstances. Some opponents say that children belong to the country and, regardless of the number, should be raised by the country. But before this social system is reformed, there are millions of children groaning in the painful life of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Birth Control Can Produce Excellent Children</p>
<p>In the past, parents often regarded their children as private property, hoping to enjoy their support in old age. In order to promote the early realization of their dreams, they made underage children work in factories to support their families. This has attracted the attention of some countries and has been restricted. Even this concept is gradually weakening. The birth control movement is not only to control those with many children, but also to allow those without children to know how to produce excellent children through birth control guidance. In the future, the birth of children will first select their parents. If the parents are not healthy, they can refuse to produce. If the parents do not have enough food and clothing, they can also avoid it. (The master of humor, Xiao Bonan, once said, "There are gardens but no children in the east end of London, and there are children but no gardens in the west end." In the future, those with gardens can also have children.) Also, if their parents do not have the opportunity for education, they can refrain from producing children. As there are 2 million unemployed people in the UK, their children have little opportunity to be educated. Therefore, those who practice birth control must have a job before producing children. Birth control advocates are the spokespersons for children who cannot express their opinions.</p>
<p>Birth Control Should Be Guided by Doctors</p>
<p>As for the future of birth control, doctors can guide the public on birth control methods. Every medical school must include birth control knowledge in the curriculum for students to use when they practice medicine in the future. Poor people can also get free opportunities. Therefore, birth control cannot be solved by simply reading newspaper articles. It is necessary to consult hospitals. There are many birth control drugs on the market. If you buy and use them without a doctor's approval, you will not only lose money but also harm your health. I hope people in Shanghai will not be fooled. Also, those who oppose birth control often say that once the birth control movement becomes popular, morality will be extremely corrupt. But if young people have proper sex education and hygiene knowledge, they can improve their morality.</p>
<p>Birth Control Solves the Population Problem</p>
<p>If we do not practice birth control and let our descendants reproduce indefinitely, then there will be no change after a thousand years, but after a million years, the increase in number will be astounding. There is a natural population limit in the universe, such as famine, epidemics, wars, and infanticide. In the 14th century, almost half of Europe's population died of plague. In the last war, 100,000 men died on the battlefield, causing 100,000 women to lose their marriage partners and preventing the birth of tens of millions of children. Now, with the advancement of medicine, diseases and hardships are no longer a problem. The League of Nations is also seeking international peace to eliminate war. If the world is truly free of diseases and wars, then there is no other way to solve the population problem except for birth control.</p>
<p>Comparison of Mortality Rates Between England and India</p>
<p>Under the same government in England and India, the birth rate in England was similar to that in India sixty years ago, but India had a higher infant mortality rate. Both places have civil education. Now the standard of living in England has increased, and life is happier, but India is the opposite. The difference is that the British can practice birth control, while India cannot. Currently, the infant mortality rate in England is 57 per 1,000, while in India it is 200. The maternal mortality rate is 4 per 1,000 in England and 20 in India. The number of children who die young is 5 per 1,000 in England and 25 in India.</p>
<p>Hope for Audience's Sympathy</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Martin hoped that the audience could sympathize with her speech and promote birth control to make families happy and spread it to the general society and the country, eliminating war, and promoting it from various countries to the world, so that the world will universally grow excellent, healthy and educated citizens.</p>
<p>Will Be Invited to Give a Political Speech</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin is not only a birth control expert but also a leader in the British women's movement. She was imprisoned for participating in the suffrage movement. Therefore, the Shanghai women's community will invite her to give another political speech.</p>

These coffins are made of thin wood and are easily broken, resulting in blood spillage and a foul odor. Corpses are dragged around by wild dogs, and bones are everywhere. Shen Yiqiu, a member of the Rend Association in the East City of Wusong, and Hou Xizhou, the director of the burial department, were greatly concerned about hygiene, especially this spring. They personally supervised the burial workers to collect more than one hundred masterless coffins from the above-mentioned locations on the previous two days when it was Qingming. They hired a boat to transport them to the Jialou Bridge Cemetery in Songxi for burial to comfort the souls and improve hygiene.</p>

<h3>Li Jinhui Fails to Repay Dance Loan: Sues Guarantor Chen Xiaodie; The Lender is Hu Guigeng of Chunqiu Company; Chen Xiaodie Claims Hu Did Not Pay the Second Loan Installment</h3>
<p>Recently, the dancer Li Jinhui, whose "Standard Beauty" Xu Lai announced her divorce from him, planned to take his Bright Moon Dance Troupe to perform in the South Seas (Nanyang) in the winter of 1934. Lacking travel expenses and costumes, he entered into a loan agreement with Hu Guigeng, the head of the Chunqiu Company in the South Seas. The company would lend Li $5,000 for costumes and $2,500 for travel expenses to help Li's trip to the South Seas. If Li earned a surplus from his performances in the South Seas, after first repaying the $7,500 loan, the company would also share a portion of the surplus. The contract was signed in November 1934, with Chen Xiaodie acting as guarantor. If Li failed to fulfill the contract, Chen would be responsible for repaying the loan. After the contract was signed and the money paid, Li has still not fulfilled the contract to this day. The company has therefore hired lawyer Qiu Hanping to file a lawsuit against Chen Xiaodie in the First Special District Court, requesting that she fulfill her responsibility to guarantee the loan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng heard the case in the Twelfth Civil Court. Chen Xiaodie hired lawyer Zuo Deshou to defend her, arguing that the reason Li did not go to the South Seas was that the company had not paid the second installment of the $2,500 travel expenses that were due, causing the trip to fail, and that he did not intend to break the contract. Judge Huang summoned Li Jinhui for questioning and ordered the case to be continued for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Committee Notifies Vehicle Owners: Re-register Rickshaw Pullers; Begins on the 14th of This Month</h3>

Regarding the continued registration and licensing of rickshaw pullers, it was also stated that the rickshaw puller license donation office will reopen on the 14th of this month. This was a decision made by the Vehicle Committee in January. If the number of original rickshaw pullers continuing to obtain licenses is short, new rickshaw pullers can continue to be registered. From the 14th, vehicle owners can bring their vehicle owner's license to the various rickshaw puller registration offices to obtain a rickshaw puller registration recommendation form. Each vehicle (two rickshaws) can recommend two people. At the same time, the Vehicle Committee reserves the right to carefully consider the issuance of licenses. The above notice has been issued by the Vehicle Committee to all vehicle owners for compliance.</p>
<h3>Secretary of Lawyer Jin Yu Almost Illegally Arrested: Falsely Accused in a Case, Investigation Proves No Involvement; Huang Jiande Not Handed Over to the International Settlement – Lawyer Jin Files a Protest</h3>
<p>Huang Jiande, a native of Suzhou and a secretary at lawyer Jin Yu's office at 68 Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, is over twenty years old and extremely honest. He is especially amiable and approachable. He previously assisted the famous lawyer Wang in managing legal affairs. Later, when Wang was appointed presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Zhenjiang Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Huang was hired by lawyer Jin Yu as a secretary and has served to this day for almost two years. Unexpectedly, yesterday at 9:30 AM, Chen Chengkun, a Chinese detective No. 194 from the International Settlement police, went directly to lawyer Jin's office and led Huang out, telling Huang that his (Huang's) cousin Huang Dong, who works at the Lao Jie Fu silk store on Nanjing Road, had recently embezzled $40 from the store. After being arrested and questioned, Huang Dong confessed that he had borrowed the stolen money to Huang Niangyuan, so Huang Niangyuan was suspected and was ordered to be arrested and brought in for questioning. Huang was shocked to hear this. He knew that he had no cousin named Huang Dong, and even if he did, they rarely met. As for the confession that he had borrowed twenty dollars of the stolen money, that was absolutely false. Huang immediately asked the detective who had come to arrest him from the British Concession Police why he had not legally come with an officer from the French Police and refused to go with him. Detective Chen then summoned the Chinese police to the Central Police Station and called the British Concession Police to send officers to take him away. At the same time, lawyer Jin Yu, upon hearing the news, immediately went to the French Municipal Police Headquarters at the Wan Zi Ma Lu to see the police chief, stating that Detective Chen was suspected of illegal arrest and requesting that, before the case was clarified, he should first be handed over to the Second Special District Court in accordance with the law, and then the British Concession Police should formally prepare a document to take him away, which would be legal. The French police chief also believed that Detective Chen's procedures were not legal, and so together with the Zhong Lan Police Station, sent Detective Chen and Huang to the Wan Zi Ma Lu Police Station. At the same time, the Public Concession Police brought the main suspect, Huang Dong, to the French Police Station. After the French police chief questioned the suspect in detail, Huang Dong finally confessed that Huang Jiande was innocent and that all the $40 he had obtained was used to buy coats, etc. The French police chief, upon hearing the confession that Huang Jiande had no criminal suspicion, did not allow the British Concession Police to take him away, and around 5:00 PM last night, sent police to return Huang to lawyer Jin Yu. However, lawyer Jin believed that this illegal arrest needed to be remedied, and yesterday sent a letter to French Consul General Bodet and the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association requesting intervention.</p>
<h3>Asiatic Society to Lecture on Chinese Fish Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Asiatic Society will invite its honorary director, Mr. Sha Huaibei, to lecture at 4:30 PM on the 8th on the topic of Chinese Fish, at the society's location at 20 Museum Road.</p>
<h3>Head of Banque de l'Indochine Changes</h3>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily quoted the Agence Havas as reporting that the head of the Shanghai branch of the French Banque de l'Indochine, originally Mr. Schiffer, is said to be returning to France on the French ship André Lebon today (the 7th), and his vacancy will be filled by Mr. Hu. It is said that Mr. Hu previously served as the head of the Hong Kong branch of the Banque de l'Indochine.</p>
<h3>Whitebait from Wusong on the Market</h3>
<p>The Wusong spring fishing season starts earliest with whitebait (commonly known as "noodle fish"). Recently, a large number of fishing boats have been successively importing them, sold by various fresh fish shops such as Dacheng and Zhou Changfa. About five catties of fish can be purchased per dollar. This type of whitebait is small and fresh, so it sells very well. However, because it is a fresh product, it cannot be stored for long, so it is not possible to sell it in more distant inland areas.</p>
<h3>Movies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theatre Re-releases Films: The Shanghai Grand Theatre on North Sichuan Road, at the intersection of Jiangxi Road, will recently undergo internal renovation, with all equipment being greatly improved. It will screen first-run blockbusters that are banned in the concession. It is said that the opening film will be "The Secret History of the Irish Revolution," which is expected to cause a sensation again.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news in the newspapers of the 6th that the business at No. 31-33, Yanhai Road, Liuhe Glass Factory, was careless, causing damage to the third floor of the No. 29 Minhua Umbrella Factory. I admire the fairness of your editor and the thoroughness of your reporters' investigation. However, I was surprised to read in your newspaper of the 7th a follow-up report on the fire on Yanhai Road, stating that the fire started in the third factory of Minhua. After investigation, our factory's housing has never had a stove, and the rear of the third floor is used as a kitchen. Moreover, the house is a concrete building, so there is little risk of fire. This is one point. If it is said that we were preparing food and wine to treat our workers on Qingming Festival, the fire at Liuhe was at almost 9:00 AM, and our factory had not yet finished breakfast. How could we have had time to prepare food and wine? This is the second point. Furthermore, fire rises from below, never from above. This is the third point. Therefore, I am writing to request that you correct this. To the Shen Bao, Minhua Third Factory, No. 29 Yanhai Road, April 7.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Radio Imports: Annual Value of 2 Million Gold Units; There are Currently 89 Radio Stations Nationwide; Shanghai Has Approximately 100,000 Radios or More</h3>
<p>In recent years, our country's radio broadcasting industry has progressed by leaps and bounds, rapidly advancing. There are a total of 89 radio stations nationwide. In the past three years, the import of radios and parts has been approximately 2 million gold units per year. The huge leak is shocking. The details are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Start of Radio Stations in Our Country</p>
<p>The start of radio broadcasting in our country began in 1922 when an American company founded the China Radio Company in Shanghai, broadcasting with a 50-watt radio station. However, it was discontinued shortly after due to poor sound quality. By 1924, the Carlow Company established a branch in Shanghai and set up a 100-watt radio station to broadcast Western music records. In 1927, the New New Company installed a 50-watt broadcasting station to report on business conditions and current events, and also inserted Chinese medicine and Chinese records. Subsequently, radio stations in various provinces and cities such as Tianjin, Beiping, Zhejiang, Kunming, Hankou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanchang Garrison Headquarters, Shandong Provincial Capital, and Hebei were established one after another. The largest of these is the Central Radio Station. In total, there are currently 89 radio broadcasting stations nationwide (excluding the four northeastern provinces), distributed in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi.</p>
<p>Statistics on Radio Stations in Shanghai</p>
<p>In addition to the municipal government's radio station, almost all radio stations in this city are privately operated. The broadcast programs focus on advertising and entertainment (with two evangelical Buddhist groups promoting religion). The highest power of each station is 600 watts, and the lowest is 30 watts. The names and power ratings are recorded below: China-Thailand 45, China-America Westerner 600, Eastland 100, Overseas Chinese 500, Eastland 100, Together-Enjoy 50, Mainland 100, Jianhua 100, Zhou Xieji 75, Asia-East 100, New New 50, Dunben 100, Qikai 30, Gospel 150, Stability 50, Allied 100, Fuxing 100, Li Shude Hall 100, Mingyuan 100, Buddhist Voice 500, Oriental 100, Sino-Western 100, China-America 100, Shanghai 100, Yuanchang 50, Asia-Sound 200, Central Research 100, Greater China 100, Shipping 100, Guohua 100, Lili 100, China-Yu 100, Ministry of Communications 500, Municipal Sound 100, China-East 200, Hui-Yuan 50, New Sound 50, French 100, Her Ming 30, Its Beauty 250, China-Light 200, Municipal Government 500.</p>
<p>Estimates of Radios</p>
<p>The music broadcast by radio stations is received by radios, so the number of radios is increasing year by year. The number of radios in our country lacks reliable statistics, so the exact number is still lacking an accurate estimate. According to the latest figures released by the International Telecommunication Union's Radio Registration Office, there are a total of more than 63,000 registered radios (a portion of which were transferred to the interior after registration), but the number of unregistered radio users is very large. According to general estimates, the total number of radios in Shanghai is approximately 100,000 or more.</p>

<p>Nineteen out of ten radios on the market are imported. Each radio costs tens of dollars at the very least and hundreds of dollars at most. The more tubes, the more expensive the price. Ordinary ones have four to seven tubes. Those with eleven or twelve tubes cannot be had for less than several hundred dollars. Profit rights flow outwards, and the leakage is very large. In the past three years, the import of radios and parts in our country has consistently hovered around 2 million gold units. Among them, American goods have seen increases and decreases, while British products have decreased year by year. German goods have increased year by year, but Japanese goods have increased the fastest. As for domestically produced radios, they are still in their infancy. Due to high costs and sluggish sales, shipments are extremely rare.</p>
<h3>Fishing for Shrimp Turns Up a Large Bomb: Hammering it Leads to Four Deaths; Xu Shoufu and Son Blown Up on the Spot; Zhou Shuli and Brothers Die One After Another from Injuries</h3>
<p>Xu Shoufu (48 years old, native of Jiangyin), a boatman, and his son Xu Gengsheng (24 years old) made a living by fishing for shrimp along the riverbank in the Donggou and Gaoqiao area of ​​Pudong. At noon the day before yesterday, while Xu Shoufu was fishing in the river near Chenjiazuiz in Gaoqiao, he caught a bomb, which he took ashore. He and three brothers from the village, Zhou Shuli, Zhou Shuyi, and Zhou Shuxin, inspected it. None of them recognized it as an extremely dangerous bomb, so they hammered it with an iron hammer. The bomb immediately exploded. Xu Shoufu and Xu Gengsheng, father and son, were directly hit. Both feet were blown off, their abdomens were torn open, and their intestines spilled out. They died on the spot. Zhou Shuli (28 years old), Zhou Shuyi (25 years old), and Zhou Shuxin (22 years old), who were next to them, suffered serious injuries to their heads, abdomens, hands, and feet. The Donggou Police Station was informed and sent police to the scene. Zhou Shuli died of his injuries almost immediately. The police sent Zhou Shuyi and Zhou Shuxin to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, Zhou Shuxin's breathing was short, and his head was swollen like a dou. He could not be saved and died. Only Zhou Shuyi's injuries were lighter, and he may be unharmed. Yesterday morning, Baochang Ling Amu reported the incident to the local court. After receiving the report, the court commissioned Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu and inspectors to first go to Shanghai Hospital to inspect the body of Zhou Shuxin, and then cross the river to Donggou to inspect the three corpses of Xu Shoufu, Xu Gengsheng, and Zhou Shuli, confirming that they had been blown to death, and ordered their families to prepare coffins separately. By the time the judge finished the inspection and returned to the court, it was dusk.</p>
<h3>Business Report of China Insurance Co., Ltd.</h3>
<p>From January 1, 1935, to December 31, 1935, this is the fourth year of the company's operation. The finalized accounts have been prepared into various forms. The following is a summary of the situation for your review:</p>
<p>Fire Insurance Business Status</p>
<p>The gross fire insurance premium income for this term, excluding reinsurance premiums allocated by foreign affiliated companies, amounted to 959,463.73 yuan in national currency. Compared with the previous term's gross income of 816,154.72 yuan in national currency, there is a significant increase. The net premium income, after deducting reinsurance premiums, has increased from 169,397.72 yuan in the previous term to 401,307.61 yuan in national currency this term. Paid and unpaid compensation totaled 173,751.35 yuan in national currency, accounting for 43.30% of the net premium. Operating expenses totaled 105,973.90 yuan in national currency, accounting for approximately 26.41% of the net premium. After offsetting income and expenses under commissions, the remaining amount is 66,732.36 yuan in national currency. In addition, including the interest generated from the previous term's surplus reserve, the total profit for this term's fire insurance portion is 105,938.72 yuan in national currency, while the previous term's profit was 127,158.14 yuan in national currency. Regarding the fire insurance reserve, in addition to the standard 40% allocation, an additional 80,000 yuan in national currency was allocated from the fire insurance profit to strengthen the company's financial position. Thus, the remaining balance under the fire insurance profit is 25,938.72 yuan in national currency, which is transferred to the general profit and loss account. During the spring and summer seasons of this term's operation, due to the reduction in goods stored in various regions, there were many premium refunds. Fortunately, since autumn, the trade situation has gradually improved, and the business has also become more prosperous. Therefore, the gains made at the end of the period were still significant. At the beginning of winter, the international situation became tense, and military insurance business suddenly became frequent. By the end of the year, the situation had eased, and things returned to normal.</p>
<p>Overview of Marine and Miscellaneous Insurance Business</p>
<p>The gross marine insurance premium income for this term has increased from 146,298.95 yuan in national currency in the previous term to 389,716.73 yuan in national currency this term. The net premium income, after deducting reinsurance premiums, is 60,670.64 yuan in national currency. Paid and unpaid compensation totaled 17,207.21 yuan in national currency. The scope of marine insurance business is still mainly limited to the domestic transportation of goods and raw gold and silver. Regarding the reserve, it is also allocated according to the usual practice of 20% of the net premium income.</p>
<p>Although automobile insurance business only accounts for a small portion of the company's overall business volume, the premium income is 11,928.98 yuan in national currency, while the compensation paid is only 3,020.09 yuan in national currency. This performance is still commendable. Several types of insurance in marine and miscellaneous insurance have very short insurance periods. Therefore, they have all expired by the end of the year, and there is no outstanding liability. As a result, there is no need to allocate reserves. The company's business scope has been expanding daily this term. For example, elevator insurance, glass insurance, and accident insurance have been launched successively. Although it is known that this type of business will develop in the future, for the convenience of customers, regardless of the variety and complexity, we accept all applications with diligence to meet the needs of our policyholders.</p>
<p>The profit from marine and miscellaneous insurance for this term is 36,355.00 yuan in national currency, which is a significant improvement compared to the previous term's profit of only 9,630.17 yuan in national currency. Out of this profit, 20,000 yuan in national currency is allocated to the reserve, and the remaining 16,355.00 yuan in national currency is transferred to the general profit and loss account.</p>
<p>Overview of Life Insurance Business</p>
<p>The growth and decline of life insurance business reflect the prosperity and decline of the national economy. The continued existence of usury hinders the progress of life insurance. With the gradual decline in interest rates, efforts to promote life insurance business are still essential.</p>
<p>The new insured amount for this term reached 1,680,224.06 yuan in national currency, compared to only 1,330,959.71 yuan in national currency in the previous term. The total amount of effective insurance as of December 31, 1935, is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ordinary Life Insurance: 2,629,496.01 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Group Life Insurance: 4,172,366.00 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned group life insurance is mostly short-term, and the required reserves have been adequately allocated.</p>
<p>The life insurance reserve for this term has increased from 100,000 yuan in national currency to 150,000 yuan in national currency, which is allocated from this term's profit. The remaining 4,266.01 yuan in national currency is transferred to the general profit and loss account.</p>
<p>General Profit and Loss Account</p>
<p>Among the company's loans, many are secured by real estate. Considering the recent decline in real estate market prices and the bleak outlook for the future market, it is necessary to allocate 80,000 yuan in national currency from this term's profit as an investment reserve, which, together with the amount allocated in the previous term, totals 130,000 yuan in national currency. However, looking at the current real estate situation, it seems to be gradually turning around. The reserves allocated by the company successively should be sufficient to cope with future changes. The market price of various domestic public bonds is actually far higher than the prices listed in the balance sheet.</p>
<p>The company's business is becoming increasingly complex, and the number of employees is also gradually increasing. To solve the future accommodation problem for colleagues, 20,000 yuan in national currency has been allocated from the profit as a real estate fund. It is hoped that further allocations will be made from the next term's profit to expedite the completion of the project.</p>
<p>The special reserve fund item listed in the company's account summary will be renamed as the general reserve in the future.</p>
<p>The net profit earned this term, after deducting various reserves, is 267,323.17 yuan in national currency, which is a significant increase compared to the previous term's profit of 259,273.73 yuan in national currency. After allocating 26,732.32 yuan in national currency to the public reserve from this term's profit, the remaining 240,590.85 yuan in national currency will be distributed as follows:</p>
<p>Dividend (annual interest rate of 6%): 150,000 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Allocated to General Reserve: 90,590.85 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>The company's various funds are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Paid-up Share Capital: 2,500,000 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Public Reserve: 94,282.89 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>General Reserve: 698,546.04 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Investment Reserve: 130,000 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Real Estate Fund: 20,000 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Fire Insurance Reserve: 380,523.04 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Marine and Miscellaneous Insurance Reserve: 89,110.82 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Life Insurance Reserve: 196,794.72 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Total: 4,109,257.51 yuan in national currency (End)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Ham Sales Industry - Compiled by China Editor (A General Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce - 21)</h3>
<p>The sole raw material for ham is pork, which is a by-product of farming. Therefore, ham production is all located inland, and Shanghai is merely a market for consumption or sales. Ham can be categorized as Southern Ham, Northern Ham, and Yunnan Ham. The quality varies, and the prices are also different. The production and sales situations are even more disparate. These will all be described separately below to provide a comprehensive overview for reference.</p>
<p>1.  Categories of Ham and Their Production and Sales Overview</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, ham can be categorized as Southern Ham, Northern Ham, and Yunnan Ham. Southern Ham is produced in Zhejiang, commonly known as Jinhua Ham. People only know that Jinhua produces ham, but they don't realize that Jinhua only produces a part of it. Other counties such as Lanxi, Dongyang, Yiwu, Yongkang, Pujiang, and Wuyi also produce ham. Among them, Dongyang's products are the most numerous, and the Jiang Ham known throughout the world is produced in that county. The bamboo ham produced in Pujiang is also quite famous, but the production volume is not large. According to general estimates, the total pork production in the above-mentioned counties is about 750,000 heads per year, of which more than two-fourths are used for ham production. The ham produced is transported through Hangzhou and Jiaxing and sold in Shanghai, accounting for the majority. The production volume of Southern Ham is less than that of Northern Ham, but in recent years, due to the larger number of people who prefer Southern Ham, the sales volume has exceeded that of Northern Ham. However, the sales volume of Southern Ham itself has also been shrinking in recent years, so its production volume has decreased from 600,000 to 700,000 pieces in the previous year to 300,000 to 400,000 pieces now. The store names and addresses of the major ham producers in each county are listed below as a reference for merchants in Shanghai to purchase goods:</p>
<p>Jiang Xuefang Hou Ji, Shangjiang Village, Dongyang; Jiang Xuefang Zheng Ji, Henglu, Dongyang; Da Dongyang Ham Zhuang, Chenqu, Dongyang; He Qianyuan, same as above; Jiang Jiufeng, same as above; Shao Yuantai, Chenqu, Jinhua; Xin Weihe, same as above; Huang Qianxing, same as above; Ding Longtai, Houbeili, Lanxi; Yong Shengyuan, Qianbeili, Lanxi; Zha De, same as above; Ji Wanxin, Chenqu, Yiwu; Chen Pingshun, Ximen, Yiwu; Xu Yishun, Nanguo, Yiwu; Huang Yimao, Huhua Ji, Xijie, Chenqu, Yiwu; Ding Shunchang, Yiwu; Yu Da, Chenqu, Wuyi.

<h3>Shen Silang Went North Yesterday - Visited Dai Jitao in Beijing and Met with Hao Liesheng - Planned to Visit Zhang Boling in Tianjin to Discuss Pre-Selection Matters</h3>
<p>Shen Silang, Director-General of the All-China Sports Mental Labor Advancement Association and member of the Chinese World Games Selection Committee, is of the opinion that as the date of the World Games is approaching, the various pre-selection preparation matters are in urgent need of consultation, especially the track and field pre-selection and joint training, and the funds and other matters must be decided after meeting with the selection committee members such as Ma Yuehan. Mr. Shen was scheduled to go north last week, but due to the accumulation of public affairs in Shanghai, he only started his journey yesterday morning. Mr. Shen originally planned to take the Shanghai-Ping Special Express train that departs at 4 PM to go north, but because he still had to get off the train in Beijing to visit Mr. Dai Jitao, the Chinese government representative to the World Games, to request instructions on public affairs, and planned to meet with Hao Gengsheng, Sports Supervisor of the Ministry of Education, to exchange opinions, he changed to taking the Shanghai-Beijing Special Express train that left at 8 AM yesterday morning to go to Beijing first.

He will arrive in Ping at 10 AM tomorrow, Thursday, and must go south on Saturday (11th). He also plans to get off the train in Tianjin to visit Mr. Zhang Boling.

<h3>Senior Billiards Competition - Zhang Yingda Remains in Poor Form - Medina Wins the Championship</h3>
<p>2000 Points vs. 890 Points Win - The Award Ceremony Was Completed That Night</p>
<p>The senior billiards competition organized by the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Association, the Portuguese Medina, won the championship with a big win of 2000 points against 890 points by Zhang Yingda in the past two days. Zhang Yingda was the runner-up. After the senior final ended last night, an award ceremony was held. The president, Mr. Bernal, gave a speech and presented silver cups and prizes to Mayor Wu Tiecheng and others. The winners of this year's competitions are: Senior Champion Medina, Runner-up Zhang Yingda, Junior Champion Zhu Qiliang, Runner-up Bao Qiyun, Snooker Champion Clark, Runner-up Bernal.</p>
<p>The Last Two Games</p>
<p>In the first two games of the senior final, Medina had a great advantage, leading with 1000 points against 396. In the second game yesterday, Medina's performance was less impressive than before, but still led due to Zhang Yingda's poor form. After finishing 500 points, he needed 48 shots, which was an average performance. Mr. Zhang scored a total of 243 points. In the fourth game in the evening, Medina showed his unique skills at the beginning of the first 20 shots, winning the praise of the audience. However, he shot casually in the last ten shots, so he only finished the last 500 points in 39 shots. He won against Zhang Yingda with 2000 points against 890. Zhang Yingda started well, but his layout was not as suitable as Medina's, so he could not exert his skills when he encountered an unfortunate situation. Yesterday's scores were: Medina (Second Game) 27, 32, 26, 29, 28, 45, 20, 23, 37, 25; (Fourth Game) 44, 32, 62, 23, 58, 25, 42, 30; Zhang Yingda (Third Game) 40, 34; (Fourth Game) 46, 33.</p>

<h3>Tea Cocoon Lending After Qingming Festival</h3>
<p>This spring, the weather has been cold for a long time, and the development of tea silkworms has been relatively late. Now it is after the Qingming Festival, so they have only begun to revive in the past few days. However, foreign banks' sales appetite is sluggish and financial turnover is difficult. There are not many operators this year. As far as the reporter knows, this time, the silver and money industry's lending to tea merchants, in addition to the old accounts being opened as usual, new accounts have always been politely refused. Therefore, at the time of registration, it was found that the total amount of tea loans released as of yesterday was less than one million. Compared with last year, the ratio is only one to ten. As for cocoon merchants, the silver and money industry is not only cautious in lending, but also requires favor in pledging, and the amount is not willing to be too large. In previous years, 100,000 or 200,000 was not uncommon, but now 5,000 or 10,000 is not easy.</p>
<h3>Financial Collection and Delivery is Stronger than Last Month</h3>
<p>In recent days, the financial industry's collection and delivery situation, although not particularly prosperous, is indeed much busier than last month. It is found that the current period is for long-term settlement, and there are relatively more imported goods. The foreign exchange demand is strong, resulting in adjustments in various industries, unlike the previous sluggishness. Yesterday, the foreign interbank rate still opened at 8 points, the same price in the morning and afternoon. Due to the lack of solid colleagues and new accounts, the interbank bill trading was not very solid, so the entry and exit were quite rare, similar to the previous few days. The morning market turnover was more than 3.1 million, and the new transaction was more than 400,000. The afternoon market transaction was more than 300,000. The small general meeting traded more than 500,000.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Mixed Sentiment and a Wait-and-See Approach in Government Bonds, Minimal Sporadic Trading, Market Close Shows Slight Firmness</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a market situation that, while still fluctuating, showed a slightly firmer trend. However, trading activity continued to decline, and the market remained sluggish. Both bulls and bears with significant holdings adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Although each side had its expectations, there seemed to be no clear way forward. The scope of activity was too limited, and any slight movement would inevitably cause changes, leading to self-inflicted troubles. The result of this mutual observation and persistence would inevitably cause the market price to become stagnant again, possibly only fluctuating when settlement approached. Yesterday morning, the sudden sale of E-type bonds at the opening caused the market price to weaken again, but the fluctuations remained minimal. In the second session, sporadic trading showed slightly more buying, pushing the price back up by five fen or one jiao. The oscillating situation was difficult to break. At the afternoon opening, there was a slight demand for 20-series bonds. On this small-scale stage, the price was slightly raised by about one jiao. At the close, both 20-series and 47-series bonds were being bought. Although the quantity was limited, the scarcity of sellers was even more pronounced, so the market continued to show firmness. D-type bonds rose by three jiao. The overall situation showed no new changes, and the dull, brewing atmosphere was difficult to break out of for the time being. As a result, most market prices slightly rebounded, showing gains of five fen or one jiao to three jiao and a half. The total turnover was 1,415,000 yuan, a decrease of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>US Steel and Automobile Stocks See Even More Intense Rise</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Feng Trading Company, yesterday (the 6th) the New York stock market saw mixed slight gains. Steel and automobile stocks saw an especially intense rise, reaching a new peak in five years. Later, the market slightly declined as bulls took profits. Utility stocks also rose later, with very active buying. Steel stocks performed well, and agricultural implement and commercial stocks advanced. Railroad and oil stocks rose by several jiao. According to estimates from a steel magazine, steel capacity utilization is currently at 64.5%, an increase of 2.5%. However, Mr. Taylor, at the annual shareholders meeting of US Steel, stated that the company currently had no intention of clearing the accumulated dividends on preferred stock, which caused a slight impact. Trading on the minor exchanges was quiet and mixed. The bond market rose slightly. Total trading volume for the day was 2,030,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Bulls Refuse to Release Holdings, Shortage of Chips, Cotton Yarn Market Becomes Tight</p>
<p>The yarn market is stable and quiet. Although the market transaction is deserted, the trend is very solid. The amount absorbed by the banking and gold industries as well as securities firms, always reluctant to let go, therefore, the lack of chips makes it difficult to move. Its trend is also very strong.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Closing is Even Firmer</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market was mediocre in the Osaka Sampin Yarn Market. At the same time, spot yarn transactions were not smooth. There were not many buyers in the market and the market was sluggish and lifeless. As a result, the prices of all months fell by two to three jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day, but this month rose by two jiao. The market price was normal after the opening in the afternoon, and gradually increased after the second market. Due to the exhaustion of chips in the market and the fact that the financial sector is still adding weight at the low, it is also heard that the sales of spot yarn are more prosperous than yesterday. The market was firmer at the close. As a result, the prices of all months rose by one, two, three, and six jiao compared with the closing price in the morning. It is found that 300 packages of Mingde were sold, 850 packages of Runkang, 1,150 packages of Xincheng, 450 packages of Hengchang, 350 packages of Renfeng, and 250 packages of Taichang. 800 packages of Huaiyu Da, 400 packages of Yiji, 550 packages of Shenji, 350 packages of Changfeng, 500 packages of Zhenda, 350 packages of Dachangcheng, and 350 packages of Gengfeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Sales Show Slight Improvement</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn were more than the previous day. It is found that a total of 620 packages were bought by various gangs throughout the day. The selling price was firm, and the buying amount of each gang is as follows.</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm, but the situation of overseas cotton industry is even more bleak. However, the cotton received by the major households remains still, and a large number of chips are closed, so the shape and movement is tight. However, the current cotton consumption is silent, and the thoughts of the industry are tired.</p>
<p>Multiple Parties Prepare to Receive Goods for Standard Cotton</p>
<p>The opening of the standard cotton market in the morning was due to the fluctuating rises and falls of American cotton, ranging from three to six pounds. Indian cotton fell by one rupee to one rupee and seventy-five paise. The market transaction was calm and the market attitude was weak. However, the amount absorbed by the bulls was not abandoned. As a result, the near months did not move, and the distant months rose by five fen to one jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. The opening in the afternoon was still flat, and gradually turned firm after entering. Due to the saying that multiple parties are preparing to receive goods, Osaka Sampin Cotton rose by two or three jiao, and the popularity turned firm. As a result, the prices of all months rose by five fen to one jiao compared with the closing price in the morning. It is found that 1,000 dan of Juxing, 1,200 dan of Hexing, 1,400 dan of Senkang, 800 dan of Yichang, 1,000 dan of Dachang, 700 dan of Xincheng, and 800 dan of Jinchang were sold. 1,200 dan of Tongji, 3,900 dan of Mingde, 3,300 dan of Changhe, 1,000 dan of Shenji, 1,300 dan of Changfeng, 1,300 dan of Runkang, and 1,200 dan of Yuanxingchang were bought.

<p>The Consumption of Spot Cotton Requires Factories to Suspend</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is still stagnant, and the factory stomachs are suspended. The source is 200 packages of Yao cotton and 240 packages of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Tianjin Coarse Velvet 46.75, Weitong Factory Enters 100 Pieces, Spot Exchange and Delivery Among Industry Peers See Considerable Buying</p>
<h3>US Cotton Still Seems Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with a fall of one to four points in all months. The foreign news was not good, but because industry peers, Liverpool, the mainland, and the Far East unanimously bought in, the market still seemed stable. Regarding the borrowing and defrauding of cotton, people's hearts were mixed. Near months were weak due to fears of short selling, bull liquidation, and southern selling. Liverpool buyers made some hedging purchases. New cotton was damaged in the east due to excessive rain, while the west lacked rain and was in great need. As a result, spot prices fell by four points, and futures prices rose and fell by four to six points. According to rumors from the cotton exchange, cotton hoarders sold 82,000 bales of spot cotton last week, with 234,000 bales still unsold. It is also estimated that the world's total cotton inventory as of the end of the 2nd totaled 23,363,000 bales, of which US cotton accounted for 12,278,000 bales, compared to 20,207,000 bales last year and 10,717,000 bales the year before. In addition, according to a survey by the New Orleans Exchange, as of the end of March, nine provinces had sold a total of 2,125,000 tons of fertilizer in eight months, compared to 2,225,000 tons last year. British spot cotton fell by five points, and futures fell by 34 points. The Indian cotton market was bleak, and prices softened due to the impact of US cotton loans, with Pingore falling by 1 to 1.25 rupees, Omra falling by 1.75 rupees, and White Rossi falling by 1.75 to 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 6th).</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Both Weak Yesterday</h3>
<p>The flour market was originally bearish, but the northern gangs were buying in the market. Although it was a mental act rather than a practical stomach, people's hearts were slightly stable. The market prices of all months were close to the closing price of the previous day. By the afternoon, the warm weather was beneficial to the new wheat harvest, and the inland gangs and factories sold out, and the non-industry hoarders also followed suit, allowing for the offering of new wheat flour in the distant months, and the wheat was more flat and soft.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the inland gangs and peddlers intended to sell, because the weather was gradually warming, and the wheat harvest was hopeful. The non-industry hoarders also did not rely on the goal of hoping for a good harvest. A part of the bulls immediately followed the market. There were fewer entries than exits, and transactions were deserted. The selling wind was even stronger in the afternoon, and the flour market was weak, and the market became more uneasy. Although the foreign wheat reported gains, the orders were already uneconomical, and all parties in the market did not pay attention to this. Therefore, the market continued to decline. The existing wheat is in a standing position due to the lack of goods. Yesterday, Fuxin went to the car to sell 1,400 packages of wheat, and the price was still opened at 5.32 yuan.</p>
<p>The drought in the United States for wheat has not been slightly reduced, and the shorts have been replenished. In addition, the morning outlook is quite good. The force of export price benchmarks affecting the market situation has increased, and it can be seen that the supply is estimated to be reduced by 1,784,000 solutions, and the increase in Canadian wheat is 763,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales are Still Not Smooth</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang only arrived at more than 20 numbers, (a total of more than 4,000 stones of goods) and the sales in this street are still flat. The package stomach is only nearly 2,000 packages for the Tianjin Qinhuangdao Gang, so although the arrival is sparse, the market situation is still stable. The market prices of Houzao japonica and Bo rice are all without glory or disgrace. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan are all stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 21 or 22 boats arrived from all roads in Hexia. The way out for all kinds of goods in the market, the white japonica store stomach is normal, and the price is without glory or disgrace. Bo rice is still dead, and the price is slightly one jiao. Yang Du Jian is stable, Ke Jian is stable, Yin Yuan is stable, and Bian Yuan is peaceful. The rest of the goods have not fluctuated much.</p>
<h3>The Market Price of Ke Hsien Originates High</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of Ke Hsien rice, the arrival of each road head was reduced, especially on the Jiujiang Road, there were only a small number of scattered packages of 500 or 600 packages every day. According to statistics, the total arrival of goods throughout the day was less than 3,000 packages, and the origin price was high. The packers did not match, and most of the cargo owners insisted. The turnover in this street was very active, but the Wen-Tai rice stored, due to insufficient identity, should not be left for a long time, for fear of decay. Therefore, most of them sought to escape with the market, so other rices could not rise. The market prices of each stall were similar to the previous market. A total of 2,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, 1,700 packages of Taizhou rice, and 300 packages of Jiangbei rice were opened throughout the day. There are also 100 tons of road broken foreign rice, which are all handled by this street.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Rise Sharply and Fall Slightly, Ke Bean Cake Has Already Appeared Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean oil was caused by the fact that high prices emerged in an endless stream, and the hearts of the people moved, so under the slight return to the standard of the even electricity, the spot goods were slightly small. The situation still needs to look at the rise and fall of the even market. The sales of bean cake are only traded in the inland. The Shantou Gang is sparse, and the market is increasingly concentrated due to the expensive soybean oil market. Yesterday, two batches of sea-grown cakes returned, totaling 2,639 pieces, and the price was 1.885 yuan. In addition, 4,000 pieces of Shahe Guangbian cake were ordered for the first batch to be delivered after thawing, and the price was 2.07 yuan.</p>
<p>Oils -- Raw Soybean Oil Soars, Cottonseed Oil Follows Closely</p>
<p>--Prices Increase to 19.8 Yuan--</p>
<p>Since the cottonseed clear oil market situation increased to 17.7 yuan in the previous market, it then returned to 16 yuan due to the stagnation of Guangbang's appetite. However, the oil factory's lack of chips eventually made the transaction deserted. Since the middle of last month, due to the gradual upward trend of soybean oil prices, the market atmosphere has been boosted, and the cotton clear oil market has also increased from 16 yuan to 17 yuan and 17.5 yuan. The subsequent market continued to increase to 19 yuan and the price was increased. However, the most recent price was only 30 to 50 dan. Until the beginning of this month, the price of raw soybean oil rose sharply, and people's hearts became more nervous, and the needs of this street became more urgent. It is heard that Sun Yu Factory sold 400 dan of open clear oil yesterday, and the market has soared to 19.8 yuan, and there is a possibility of further increase in the future market.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: English Low-Grade Black Tea Sales Suddenly Improve</h3>
<p>London is the general exchange center for black tea. The market of tea there has a huge relationship. According to news from English tea merchants, there has been a sudden change in the black tea market in London recently. The sales of medium and low-grade black tea are very active, and high-grade goods are stagnant. The situation is very different from the previous months, due to the decision of English and Dutch tea merchants to limit production, and consumer stores took the opportunity to hoard, but high-grade fine goods have not progressed due to their expensive value.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: There is a Need for High-Quality Sun-Dried Meat in This Street</h3>
<p>--The Market Plate Rises by 5 to 6 Yuan--</p>
<p>Shima sun-dried meat has been lacking in transportation for a long time, and the stock of firms in the market has been out of stock for many days. Yesterday, the Taiyuan ship imported it from Xiamen, and two boxes have been transported. It is suitable for the current need in this street, and it is heard that the firms sold it in retail, and it was immediately sold out, an increase of 5 to 6 yuan compared to the past. According to the cargo owner's letter, the origin price has also increased by about 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices are Stable and Transactions are Not Many</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, without much ups and downs. The association's plan: 24th coarse sand white spot goods 22 yuan, transshipment 6 yuan 9 jiao 8, Dong Chi Bai are at the original price, but 4th white transshipment goods are small 5 fen, at 6 yuan 9 jiao half, this factory's cotton white Zhenji No. 1 20 yuan 6 jiao, Jinxin Dahua No. 1 are 20 yuan 8 jiao, No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 are still withdrawn, and the current market for domestic Chaoqing follows the price of the origin slightly, but the transaction is not strong, and it is difficult to improve for the time being. Yesterday, only 10 packages of Chong Tiqing were opened, 10 yuan and 8 jiao. Zhang Diaoqing Jianbang continued to open 200 packages, and the price was 9 and a half yuan, without any changes.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Flannel Fabric Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market sales of gray plain headgear flannel were very smooth. The demand from buyers was more enthusiastic than last week, and the trend was prosperous. The Dong Shen Di inventory was not much, and half of the industry had already been sold to the gang. 4.0 yuan flannel can be said to be almost collected. Occasionally, those who hold it are all shouting for 5 yuan. Looking at the future market, there is still a trend of further increase. The current No. 1 flannel is sold at 6.25 yuan per yard, No. 2 police goods is 5.75 yuan, No. 3 goods is about 5 yuan, and No. 4 goods is more than 4 yuan, and most of them are out of stock. The yarn goods at the bottom of the Melton are shouted for 3.25 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Anhui Tea Research (II)</h3>
<p>-- Shi Jifa</p>
<p>Chuzhou, Quanjiao, and Lai'an Counties: Also belong to northern Anhui, and produce a lot of tea. For example, the tea produced in Quanjiao is called Nan Qiao Tea and Bei Qiao Tea, which are mostly drunk by people in Hankou, but less so in Beijing and Shanghai. Lai'an produces Xinchang Tea, also known as Shouyang Tea, which has a fragrant aroma and a strong taste. You can't stop drinking it, and the price is relatively low. Anhui produces a lot of tea, ranking first in the country. In addition to the above-mentioned counties, Qiupu in southern Anhui, Jingxian, Taiping, Tonglu, Shitai, Xuancheng, Ningguo, Langxi, Guangde, and other counties. Taihu, Susong, Tongcheng, Lingbi, and other counties in northern Anhui also produce tea. In addition to providing for local use, there are also small vendors who transport it to neighboring provinces for sale.</p>
<p>Types</p>
<p>The types of tea produced in various tea-producing counties in Anhui are different. The findings of the survey are described as follows:</p>
<p>Qimen: The entire county has winding mountains and high terrain, making it a natural tea-producing area. It is considered the best and most abundant tea in the entire Huizhou. Residents of the entire county rely on tea as their only production. Residents have rich experience and research on tea tree cultivation methods. The Anhui Model Tea Plantation once tested the tea varieties of various villages in Qimen, and the result was that the Qimen Xixiang tea variety (round with one flat side, with thick grains and shells) was characteristic, and was superior to Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and other provinces. Naxiang tea varieties (round and triangular, with small grains and thin shells), Dongxiang and Chengxiang tea varieties (mostly round, with occasional triangular grains, small grains and thin shells) are also good.</p>
<p>Wuyuan: Wuyuan Fuyuan is quite wide, with many mountains and producing areas divided into Dongxiang, Ximen, and Beimen three areas, with Dongxiang producing the most, followed by Beimen and Ximen. Most of them produce green tea, and the Pearl Tea produced in Qianggong Mountain is the most excellent.</p>
<p>Xiuning: The production volume is the largest in the north and two districts. The tea in Naxiang has long been welcomed by foreigners. The Qimai in Baiyun Mountain, Song Mountain, and Jinlong Mountain in Beixiang are strong, and the products include Sparrow Tongue, Lotus Heart, and Jin Ya.</p>
<p>County: There are many producing areas in the whole county, and the most abundant one is Dazhouyuan. The baked green tea and fried green tea produced are the best in the whole 歙. If the old bamboo tea produced in Laozhu Ridge. Huangshan is entrenched in the territory, and the Tiandu Yunwu and other teas produced are extremely famous. In addition, Songzhu Mountain is also excellent, and the tea produced in Zixia Mountain is better than orchids in color, fragrance and Qing Dynasty, and is a rare treasure.</p>
<p>Gang County: Gangjing is narrow and mostly stone mountains, so there is less tea production. Its Zhoujiayuan tea variety is half round and half arc triangular, which is also a good variety.</p>
<p>Xuxi: The only producing area is the Badu in Xixiang, such as Huangzhu Mountain, Shangjin Mountain, Tea Farm, and Muyun Mountain. The production volume is large and the quality is excellent. The Shiyu tea produced in Jinshan is famous throughout the country, and the sales in North China are huge.</p>
<p>Huoshan: The whole territory produces tea, which is better than Lu'an. Because of its affiliation, it is covered by the name Lu'an. The mountains in the territory are high and foggy, and the Qing Dynasty Shu Qi is produced, which does not need artificial planting. Its Qing Dynasty is so unique that it cannot be added. The teas produced in the whole county include Zhulan, Jasmine, Silver Needle, Sparrow Tongue, Plum Piece, Orchid Head, Songluochun, Yuqian, Maojian, etc., which are sold to northern Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Pingjin. The area around Shanxi is huge. The tea species are mostly multi-angled and small in size.</p>
<p>Lu'an: The whole territory is mountainous and produces a lot of tea. The tea produced in Songzhu Mountain has a fragrant and beautiful taste, and other mountains are decisive. The tender buds picked at the beginning are Baihao Yinzhen Sparrow Tongue, etc. Then the tender leaves are picked as plum slices, chrysanthemum cakes, etc. When it comes to the beginning of summer, the tender branches are picked and named Fen Needle.</p>
<p>Guangde: Belonging to southern Anhui, it also produces tea. The tea seeds are mostly three-sided round and one-sided flat, with thin shells.</p>
<p>Introduction of New Works</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yinbei's new work "Outline of Rural Social Cooperative Economy" is quite able to be summarized and suitable for practical use. At the end of each chapter, there are questions attached, which is especially convenient for self-study. However, the bookkeeping format attached, although it is a single-form, is suitable for rural application and convenience. From the point of view, it seems that the old-style account book form is more suitable. There is no need to stick to horizontal writing.</p>

<h3>The Hope of National Products Industry Under the Policy</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The survival of national products lies in the national confidentiality policy, firmly establishing the national tariff barrier, and increasing the price of foreign goods to benefit the national products manufacturers, so that the national products can compete with foreign goods. If the protection policy cannot be implemented, coupled with the tax evasion and smuggling of foreign goods, which cannot be prevented, not only will national products be defeated by foreign goods, but the national economy and national finance will also be seriously affected. Mr. Bai Chongxi once said to the Liangguang Industrial Investigation Group: "If the national products industry is not protected by policies, it will be supported by hard work and suffer from difficulties and dangers. As a result, it will inevitably become a victim of imperialism." The words are sincere and chilling. We feel that the current national products industry is indeed at its extreme difficulty. The competition of peers and the dumping of foreign goods have been eroding the nascent industry every day, and the heavy burden of donations and taxes, the difficulties of transportation, and the lack of unification of the monetary system and exchange rates are all fatal injuries to industrial progress. It is true that they are each governing themselves and not seeking each other, and in the middle, they lose a lot of spiritual wealth and unnecessary expenses, which is even more uneconomical. When we investigated the national products industry in Guangdong, we threatened that the industry of a country did not have a whole plan and a way to communicate with each other? Such an uneconomical phenomenon will occur. For example, Guangdong does not produce cotton or wool. Then, instead of running a cotton weaving wool industry in Guangdong, it is better to run another industry, which is more effective and easier to achieve results. All in all, whether internally or externally, there must be policies and a whole plan, and the national products industry will have the hope of survival and long-term development.</p>
<h3>Jinpu Machine Factory Gong Xinglei Invents National Products Dual-Purpose Folding Umbrella</h3>
<p>— Yilu</p>
<p>Completed in Seven Years, the Ministry of Industry Approved Patent, Dual-Purpose for Sunny and Rainy Days, Currently Planning to Set Up a Factory for Manufacturing</p>
<p>Although the citizens' use of national products only started recently, in these short three months, there have been several satisfactory things, which seems to be worth our gratification.</p>
<p>What are these things? The first is this year's January surplus, although February was again a deficit. But if we work hard and move forward, then the word surplus seems to have the possibility of being found in the newspaper. But this is not within the scope of this article, so let's leave it alone for now. The second thing that satisfies us is that the newly invented national products continue to appear, like the national products dual-purpose folding umbrella discussed in this article, which is one of them.</p>
<p>Failure is the mother of success, this sentence is indeed correct. The success of the national products dual-purpose folding umbrella has gone through several failures, but what is the result? Finally achieved the purpose of success! The inventor of this kind of sunny and rainy umbrella is Mr. Sheng Jun Xinglei, who entered Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, is only twenty-five years old now, and has only received primary school education, but because his temperament is very suitable for engineering, he usually likes to study practical tools. In 1928, he was only seventeen years old. After graduating from primary school, he was introduced by someone to work as a toolman in the Puzhen Machine Factory of the Jinpu Railway. In his spare time, he read various books and newspapers. In 1930, he suddenly received an hint, preparing to manufacture a pocket umbrella that could be used for both sunny and rainy days. Since he made this aspiration, he has been studying all the time, day and night. At that time, many people ridiculed him, but he never moved. After studying like this for two years, the first part was successful! But when applying for a patent, the Ministry of Industry did not approve it because the manufacturing was not refined. So he made a second step of research, spending four years, and applied again for the Ministry of Industry to approve the patent, but because the use was not flexible, he was ordered to study and improve it again. Until last year, it was all completed, and the previous drawbacks of inflexible use were also gone. So the Ministry of Industry approved the patent. Although it took more than seven years, the result was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The manufacturing materials of this umbrella are all national products. The external form is almost the same as a flashlight, nine inches long, one inch in diameter. When folded, it can be hidden in the pocket. The method of use is: first hold the umbrella's sliding ring and push it upwards, then use another hand to pull out the umbrella handle retracted inside, and after opening it, it is the same as an ordinary umbrella. Moreover, this umbrella can be used not only on sunny days; but also on rainy days, so it is called a dual-purpose folding umbrella for sunny and rainy days. It is also called a dual-purpose pocket umbrella for sunny and rainy days. As for when you want to shrink it, you also first hold the umbrella's sliding ring, then grab the umbrella handle with the other hand, turn one hand to the left; turn the other hand to the right; then the umbrella's sliding ring is tightened downwards, and the umbrella handle retracts upwards, and it returns to the size of a flashlight!</p>
<p>Since Gong Xinglei obtained the patent approval from the Ministry of Industry, he is now preparing to raise funds to set up a factory for manufacturing. If it proceeds smoothly, in the near future, this kind of dual-purpose umbrella for sunny and rainy days will be found on the market! And the price will not be very expensive, almost everyone can afford it!</p>

<h3>Planting Tung Trees and Broadly Planting Other Oil Seedlings</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>In the domestic goods special issue of the Shen Bao on the 12th of this month, Mr. Qiulang's article "During the Peak Tung Oil Export Period, Chinese People Should Quickly Plan to Plant Tung Trees" was published. The argument was insightful, and the guidance was detailed. Given the urgency of the world's needs today and the abundant profits from planting tung trees, coupled with government promotion and encouragement, and the determination of the Chinese people to improve, in a few years, the quantity and quality will increase, and exports will surge. This is indeed the only major path to promote domestic products and recover rights and interests. After reading it, I was filled with admiration. However, planting tung trees is an urgent task, and broadly planting other various oil seedlings is an even more urgent matter. The reason for the sharp increase in tung oil exports this year is due, firstly, to the urgent needs of various countries in military and scientific fields, and secondly, to the fact that the tung trees planted in the United States have not yet reached the harvest period. Therefore, it is not necessarily certain that my country's tung oil exports can maintain their advantage in a few years. Therefore, for the sake of the entire national economy, we must, on the one hand, promote the export of domestic products, and on the other hand, reduce the import of foreign goods. Currently, observing the import of foreign goods, kerosene alone accounts for more than 12 million yuan each year, which is shocking! Upon investigation, kerosene is almost entirely used for lighting. The ancients said, "A lamp like a bean," and "Accompanied by a green lamp," referring to the unimproved vegetable oil lamps of the past, whose brightness was indeed inferior to the foreign lamps that now cover the country. Therefore, the sales of kerosene are becoming increasingly prosperous, and the huge leak cannot be offset by the number of tung oil exports from my country. Now my country has invented vegetable oil lamps (invented by Zhong Ling), whose structure is based on scientific principles, providing bright light comparable to foreign lamps, while being safer, more hygienic, and saving oil. The China Oil Lamp Company (No. 218 Shandong Road, this city) manufactures and sells them, and all kinds of vegetable oils in our country can be burned. Therefore, if the Chinese people can widely plant oil seedlings, sufficient fuel can be provided, and its effect can reduce kerosene imports, which is the same goal as promoting tung oil exports. As for when international wars break out and the source of kerosene is cut off, this will be a sharp weapon for national defense. It is hoped that the entire country, from top to bottom, will pay attention, use wasteland, and widely plant oil seedlings, either to promote them abroad or to use them domestically, increasing exports on the one hand and reducing import surpluses on the other, which is a crucial plan for saving the country. After reading the article "Strive to Plant Tung Trees," I had these associations and asked the readers what they thought.</p>
<h3>Worsted Wool Reunites the Lotus Flower</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>—A tragicomedy of separation and reunion of a domestic goods couple</p>
<p>"Dr. Tai Shuangqiu, a practitioner of using domestic goods, is known to everyone as one of the most vigorous promoters of the domestic goods movement!" The unveiling of "Domestic Goods First Year" and the establishment of the Nianer Movement Society are well-known facts!</p>
<p>However, his wife, Ms. Huang Jiwei, has somewhat different views. She advocates that beautiful domestic goods should be promoted. She was a little unhappy and mischievous when she saw him always wearing dirty blue cloth jackets and trousers! Originally, domestic goods and national goods are fundamentally two-in-one and one-in-two, and there is no sharp contradiction! He also felt that his own domestic goods advocacy should be implemented and was unwilling to yield to his wife, so they began to play a "divorce song" because of this small ripple! They both signed at the lawyer's office one day, but although they were superficially divorced, they were actually still closely connected and friendly! After returning from a spring outing, they had a heart-to-heart talk and jointly showed off the "worsted wool" woven by the Textile Cooperative, which was very beautiful and generous! She was delighted to see it and said, "Why didn't you say so earlier?" They both smiled! So they canceled the divorce and became husband and wife again as before! The good story spread and became a beautiful tale! And Mr. Wubian's poem "Thank you, Weaver Girl, for reuniting our feet, and tailoring the clouds and brocade to remarry" is the most appropriate! I say, "Worsted wool reunites the lotus flower" is truly a good story in the history of domestic goods!</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>Mrs. Dewey said, "I will not commit suicide; if I want to commit suicide, I must first kill two people who should be killed." Friends who are thinking of suicide because of national disasters should be aware of this.</p>
<p>It is said that in the past, many people committed suicide at Yanziji in the capital, so someone put up two slogans on it: "Think about it, you can't die!" "It's not worth dying like this!" Indeed, what is the value of suicide?</p>
<p>Friends who commit suicide for "unrequited love" are not only demons in the field of love, but also sinners against morality. Why bother?</p>
<p>The most painful thing in life is not having the responsibility to fulfill. Have friends who commit suicide fulfilled all their responsibilities? The country is like this, the society is like this... If the soul is not confused, it will also be a "bitter ghost" under the Nine Springs.</p>
<p>"As long as the green hills remain, there is no need to worry about firewood." May friends who are preparing to commit suicide repeat these words.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of General Göring</h3>
<p>— Yu Translation</p>
<p>"Have you heard about the new cigarette cards? A set of 'Göring in Full Military Uniform'. One hundred cards—each different." This is the latest gossip material that Germans are secretly talking about.</p>
<p>General Göring is the German Air Force Minister and Prussian Prime Minister, who loves to wear beautiful military uniforms and hang brilliant medals. In recent months, several amusing anecdotes have occurred in Germany about him, the most popular of which is the bathroom flood.</p>
<p>One day, he was taking a bath at home, and the bathroom was full of water. His male servant ran to the general to report: "Master, the floor in the bathroom is already six inches deep!" "Well, I know, don't stand here talking too much, don't open your mouth," General Göring was probably a little annoyed, and suddenly shouted loudly: "Bring me my Air Force General's uniform!"</p>
<p>When the male servant brought the uniform, he couldn't find the general's medals and badges. He searched everywhere, but there was still no trace. Finally, when he was almost completely desperate, he suddenly remembered where the medals and badges were. It turned out that he had forgotten to take the medals and badges off his master's pajamas that morning.</p>
<p>As for praising this Prussian Prime Minister, which contains a joking meaning, there are really too many to enumerate. The most meaningful and interesting thing is that he received a photo album as a congratulatory gift when he got married last year. The photo album was not filled with photos, but with anecdotes about him, published in newspapers, a large amount of material collected and clipped. It is said that the Führer Hitler often talked to him about this strange gift, and laughed heartily.</p>
<h3>Popular Songs and Mountain Songs</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>In the air of the city, all day long, the sound waves of songs like Little Peach Red and lyrics like Fengyang songs are broadcast from the radio, without a moment of silence, making people dizzy and wishing they could grow wings and fly to my hometown in the countryside. Because in my hometown with mountains and rivers, farmers and village women, and even girls, can all sing mountain songs that are popular and easy to understand, and have profound meaning. Although these mountain songs have not been composed by composers with staff notation, and naturally there is no violin accompaniment, they are sung leisurely and gracefully in the open air of the countryside, and the melody is so sweet that it is captivating, which cannot be described in words, and cannot be understood without experiencing it personally. Although the mountain songs in my hometown rarely contain gorgeous and seductive sentences, it is a kind of natural sound, absolutely unlike the songs popular in the city, which are completely contrived and boring because the lyrics are adapted to the melody. The author grew up in the countryside, so he has a considerable understanding and love for the mountain songs in the village. Therefore, even though I am now living in the city, whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and hear the sound of bustling music from the neighbor's radio, I always mutter, "How annoying, who wants to listen to this tune? The mountain songs in my hometown are beautiful."</p>
<h3>A Bomb That Can Explode</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>But this time, I was disappointed. When I returned to my hometown, I didn't hear a single familiar mountain song that I used to hear in my childhood. On the ship connecting the trading port and my hometown, I heard the boatmen humming the tune of "Everyone together..." instead of the old "A girl by the river..." Along the way, I heard pedestrians on the shore humming "Gently cast the net, pull the rope tightly..." and "Thousands of peach blossoms..." each once. Rushing home, my sister-in-law was humming "Baby wants to sleep..." to coax the child to sleep. The children outside the house were singing in unison "Since Emperor Zhu came out..." It is said that mountain songs like "The moon hides in the clouds like it's shy, a young girl marries west of the stone bridge..." are no longer sung. So I couldn't help but sigh and say, "Alas, has this also invaded the countryside?"</p>
<h3>Swapping Nesting Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near Double Ninth Festival, Seeking Tranquil Small Gathering, Remembering Old Dreams, Drinking Hate for a Thousand Years</p>
<p>Because when I was a child, I met a teacher who had a red face, big cheeks, pockmarks, and a white beard. When he spoke, his saliva splashed everywhere, and his hands and feet danced, which was a bit funny. He liked to tell stories, especially love stories, we were more than Ruan Dahuzi who made swallow notes. I thought about it in my heart, and couldn't help but laugh. Lan Chang was about to ask me why I laughed, but heard a woman's voice asking: Is Mr. Lan Chang at home? Although this is a common sentence, it has a lot of Nanjing accent. This Nanjing accent is the easiest to recognize. It was unexpected that a female guest from Nanjing would visit here. So I looked towards the door, and a female guest walked over through the shade of the trees. From a distance, I saw that she was also wearing a light gray long jacket, and her figure was also very thin. Lan Chang had already rushed forward to greet her and led her in. Closer, I saw clearly that it was an old lady in her fifties. She didn't cut her hair and wore a small bun. There were a few silver strands on her round bun, which showed that she could not hide her old age. However, her face, in its thinness, had no wrinkles. On her slightly high nose, she wore a pair of old-fashioned toric glasses, half hiding her sharp eyes. She carried a large leather bag and walked slowly over to the small pavilion. Lan Chang waved to me and said: This is Mr. Ruan, brother, come and meet him. When I heard this, I felt like I had walked into a pine forest full of rough branches, and suddenly encountered a plum blossom tree. I was both surprised and happy. After Lan Chang introduced Mr. Ruan, he bowed to me and said with a smile: I have long admired you, sir. I should have visited you in , but because of my humble background, I didn't dare to make a decision. I was very happy to hear that you could come to Suzhou. Lan Chang asked Mr. Ruan to sit down, and after I said a few words of humility, I asked: Does Mr. Ruan also live in Suzhou? He smiled and said: No! Suzhou is where blessed people live, how can I live here? I asked: Do you live in Nanjing then? He smiled, and then said: I take the world as my home. I understood that he was unwilling to show his true identity. It is impolite to ask a woman about her whereabouts, no matter how old she is. So I silently sat aside and didn't interrupt for the time being. Lan Chang's house has another group of female guests, and after Mr. Ruan sat in the pavilion for a while, he led her to the inner room. I propped my head with my hand and thought for a while, thinking that his big leather bag contained a history of hardship. But I don't know how he will tell me? And how will I ask him if I don't understand something? As I was thinking this, Fang Dabai, who was sitting beside me, said to me: What are you thinking about? Do you think Mr. Ruan is strange?

<h3>Notes on What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Hua Jia)</p>
<p>It's not the first time, it happens almost often, on Shangma Road, on Nanjing Road, on Sichuan Road, sometimes also on Henan Road or Shandong Road. A middle-aged man wearing a very old long robe, with a wide face, but everything seems sluggish, a round head, without dense hair, a very slow person, he always holds unusual envelopes, sometimes also smoking a cigarette, walking very slowly. As long as I get close to him, he puts the envelope in front of me, and often says in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Young master, young master, do you know where Yangshupu is?"</p>
<p>The first time he asked me, I gave him directions, telling him to go out and take the Route 8 tram to Yangshupu Road. After thanking him, he walked away again, but instead of following the directions I gave him, he walked in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Later, I followed him, and he asked the second passerby again, still asking the same question. Perhaps this passerby was too busy and ignored him. After a while, he asked the third person again. This time, the passerby probably often encountered him asking people like this, and walked away without stopping. I was wondering in my heart: Why does he always ask? And why doesn't he follow the directions after asking? This strange psychology has not been resolved until now. Because since the first time, I have often seen him asking like this, and the number of times he has asked me is probably more than ten times.</p>
<p>Now I still don't understand, I think he is definitely not asking for directions, or "Yangshupu" and him have had something "unresolvable", so he has become so madly walking on the road asking for directions all day long. But why is he so free? Doesn't he have anything else to do all day long? Won't he have a moment of awakening?</p>
<h3>A Gathering at Bi Chang with All Gentlemen Including Du Liang, Zhao Tongxu, A Liaoyang, Zhong Yong, Tai Xi, Bie You, and Others, Improvised for All of You</h3>
<p>— Liao Shi</p>
<p>The previous trip seems to have been a year ago. Today, I linger here with all the elders. The towering pavilion faces the lake. Famous poems on the scabies wall compete in beauty. Clear sages and turbid worthies are inscribed with white dross. Loose hairpins and loose hair are felt by Zhu Xuan. This pavilion temporarily belongs to us. Greenery competes to collect wine bowls.</p>
<h3>A Poem for Mr. Yu Jitiao on the Cihu Lianyin Picture</h3>
<p>— Liao Shi</p>
<p>The sound of cranes rises to the sky one by one. The old traces of poetry dream of emerald green. The mossy atmosphere is green and blue, condensing stone orchids. Duckweed traces are light and scattered on the waves. The pavilion climbs to drink green, and happiness floats in white. Tomb worship returns the wind, and sorrow falls in the twilight. Entering the book must retain the anecdotes. The lake light shines and changes too dependent.</p>
<h3>Visiting Feng Duliang at Yin Bi Chang</h3>
<p>— Zhong Yong</p>
<p>I heard that you returned east, and I was overjoyed. I lifted my clothes and followed your steps to the top. Immediately I saw your face, which was no longer middle-aged. I only felt that your bearing was like that of my original teacher. The lake light in the cup is round and has a halo. The sutras sung before my eyes are as exquisite as silk. The world is declining, and I also feel that Confucianism is useless. But I am worried about parting again tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Teaching Whip</h3>
<p>— Shen Xigang</p>
<p>A teaching whip is originally a convenient teaching aid. When teachers teach in the classroom, they often use a small bamboo pole to point to the white characters on the blackboard, so that students standing on the side can easily see the characters on the blackboard without being obscured by lines.</p>
<p>In addition, teaching whips are used for rhythm in music lessons and to assist posture when speaking. Some are even used to whip students.</p>
<p>I remember when I was studying in primary school, our teacher always brought a smooth teaching whip to class. It was made of a small purple bamboo, and the outside was tightly wrapped with a light yellow head rope. Whenever we sat tired and made some noise, he would always "clap, clap" on the podium a couple of times. The students' voices disappeared. Then he could continue teaching in peace. It was a coincidence that one time, a student in the first grade fell asleep during class. He didn't know why he was particularly annoyed, so he used the teaching whip to strike the podium heavily a few times, scaring the student so much that he jumped up and finally cried and went back to tell his mother. And that night, he had a fever and chills. The next day, his mother came to school to question our teacher. As a result, our teacher expressed his deep apologies and invited a doctor to treat his student, which cost some medical expenses.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was stimulated by this incident. From then on, when he came to class, he lacked a smooth and light yellow teaching whip.</p>
<p>This was twenty years ago. Now I am also a primary school teacher myself. Whenever I see my colleagues using teaching whips in class, I think of my teacher's story twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3>Effective Prescriptions for Family Use</h3>
<p>— Ai Mei</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "A simple prescription can make a famous doctor die of anger." In fact, there are many diseases that require time to be diagnosed and treated by a doctor, but the prescriptions passed down by the world only mention one or two things that doctors consider insignificant, and they often get better immediately after taking them. Some even have things that are beyond imagination and cannot be explained by common sense. How strange! Yang Xiangchi from Yunnan showed me a bundle of proven prescriptions: all are simple, easy to prepare, inexpensive, and remarkably effective. I publish them to benefit poor patients.</p>
<p>Minor Cold: If you are slightly infected with a cold, feel dizzy, tired, have a stuffy nose and runny nose, commonly known as a minor cold; you can cook a bowl of noodles, with two-thirds meat soup and one-third hot vinegar, add a lot of spicy chili ingredients, add a little green onion and ginger, and drink a cup of warm wine as a supplement, and you will sweat immediately and get better.</p>
<p>Prolonged Cough and Weakness Due to Cold: People with weak bodies and prolonged coughs are prone to catching a cold and coughing during major seasonal changes, such as the equinoxes and solstices. They often have a prolonged cough that does not heal. You should take three eggs, remove the yolks and keep the whites, put them in a bowl and mix them with sugar, then take a few slices of ginger and two qian of Jingjie and decoct them in boiling water. Then use this water to pour into the egg bowl, mix it, and take it. Take it once every morning and once before going to bed. It will be effective in one or two days.</p>
<p>Initial Dysentery: In the early stage of dysentery, cook one or two liang of wood ear, remove the water, put it in a bowl, mix it with fermented bean curd juice, add a little mountain pepper, and use it as a side dish. Eat it for several days in a row. Severe cases will be reduced, and mild cases will be cured immediately.</p>
<p>Prolonged Dysentery: For persistent dysentery, take pine resin and burn it, drip its oil onto the skin of a banana, add two pieces of fried scorched glutinous rice candy—that is, maltose—and decoct it and take it immediately. Also: five qian of Cao Guo peel, one liang of charcoal ginger, and five qian of fried scorched glutinous rice can also stop dysentery.</p>
<p>Abdominal Pain: If you have cold abdominal pain without chills or fever, take a dozen peppercorns, grind them into powder, and swallow them with hot soup.</p>
<p>Toothache: For those suffering from wind-heat toothache, grind calcined gypsum and white pepper into a fine powder; apply it to the teeth to relieve pain.</p>
<p>Yellow Water Scabies: Yellow water scabies is a terrible disease. You can boil mutton twice to promote suppuration and decay, and the scab will form in seven days.</p>
<p>Ear Sores: For children with sores in their ears, drip male chicken bile into the ears. After one or two days, the heat toxin will be completely removed, and the scab will form immediately; then moisturize it with vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Insomnia: Before going to bed, pour boiling water over ghee and add rock sugar; eating it is most effective for nourishing the heart and calming the nerves, and it is quite effective for treating insomnia.</p>
<p>Prevention: Prepare a bowl of clear vinegar, add salt, , garlic, and pepper, each in a small amount; take fresh and cut it into slices, immerse them in the bowl of vinegar; eat them from time to time, so you can rely on them to avoid the spread of the plague.</p>

<p>Pollution Treatment (that is, "Himi Gu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets.")</p>
<p>Pegenelin (that is, "Reproductive Element.")</p>
<p>This disease is mostly caused by masturbation, resulting in loose sperm gates. Therefore, "Himi Gu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" are the main treatment. Swallow two to four tablets with boiled water before going to bed. Patients have depleted sperm, weak brains, and have many dreams, and also complain of insomnia and forgetfulness. Therefore, "Reproductive Element" should be taken at the same time. Three times a day, three tablets each time, swallowed with boiled water.</p>
<p>Patient Ji Luping came to the clinic last winter, complaining of spermatorrhea, night sweats, etc., insomnia, forgetfulness, dizziness, and blurred vision, which were unbearable.

<h3>Salvation for Patients with Weak Brains</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. Yang Jintao) I was born with a weak constitution. During my childhood, I did not develop well. My body was thin and weak, and my qi and blood were deficient. Starting in the spring of my nineteenth year, I suddenly suffered from nocturnal emission, leading to seminal depletion, back pain, dizziness, and blurred vision. During the day, I was forgetful; at night, I suffered from insomnia. I had neurasthenia, pessimistic thoughts, and was like a fool or a madman, often contemplating suicide. I took many tonics, but they had no effect. Last autumn, I submitted a question to the Q&amp;A column of this publication. I was advised to take "Hymetop's Semen-Consolidating Pills" and "Reproductive Essence" internally. I immediately purchased them from the nearby Taihe Pharmacy and took them according to the instructions. After taking them, my semen became sufficient, my brain became healthy, and all my ailments were eliminated. My nerves were revitalized, my qi and blood were abundant, and my thoughts became positive and optimistic. Recalling the inhuman suffering of the past, it was no less than being saved and reborn.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Stomach Pain Cured in a Month</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Stomach pain is often regarded as a stubborn and incurable disease. In fact, the causes of stomach pain vary. If the stomach medicine taken only addresses one aspect, it will naturally be difficult to cure. If the medicine is appropriate for the condition, how can it not be cured? Let me give an example to illustrate the treatment method. If there are patients with long-term stomach pain who have been delaying treatment, they can learn from this.</p>
<p>Last winter, Mr. Sha Yanjiu came to me for consultation, complaining that he had suffered from stomach pain for nearly twenty years. He had tried various remedies, all of which had only temporary effects. He had been taking medicine for many years, but it had not been cured. Because his cousin, Mr. Sha Songgu, had his stomach ailment cured by me, he earnestly asked me to cure him as well. I diagnosed that Mr. Sha's stomach ailment was very severe and could not be effectively treated with ordinary stomach medicine. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Remedy" from Huamei Pharmacy to treat his kidney pain and eliminate the root cause of the disease. I also prescribed "Stomach-Strengthening Essence" to nourish his weakened stomach. Within a month, not only did he become strong and healthy, but he also never experienced pain again. Moreover, after recovery, he stopped taking medicine and it never recurred. He repeatedly expressed his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Premature Aging and Joint Pain</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. Chen Jiadong) I previously suffered from venereal disease, which, although cured, turned into symptoms such as joint pain and blood depletion, leading to a withered appearance. I had taken many kinds of Chinese and Western medicines, but they did not have a noticeable effect. My lower back and back ached, my muscles spasmed, my body was thin and weak, and it was difficult to walk, causing me great pain. (Omitted) In early winter, I was introduced by my roommate, Mr. Chen Peichang, to Dr. Zhan Nianhui for treatment. He instructed me to purchase "John Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Chinese-Western Pharmacy to search for toxins and eliminate the ailment. My bone pain was immediately relieved. He also prescribed "Reproductive Essence" to restore my declining condition. My qi and blood were immediately invigorated, and my muscles became plump and strong. After taking about half a dozen doses, I have now recovered to the youthful state I had many years ago. Moreover, my strength and health are better than I have ever experienced in my life.</p>
<h3>Disease Q&amp;A (Please include detailed address and return postage with your letter)</h3>
<p>This column is generally answered by well-known doctors Wang Shiying, Ren Guoxiang, Yu Bofu, Qiao Wenbin, Jia Zhizhong, Zhan Nianceng, and the editors. (Use a pseudonym for your question.)</p>
<p>Homebound</p>
<p>(Young Fool asks) I injured myself through masturbation, causing heart palpitations and flank pain. It is difficult for me to take even a small step. Any slight movement causes shortness of breath and palpitations. As a result, I have been unable to leave my home for seven years. Please tell me the root cause of my illness and provide a treatment method.</p>
<p>(Answer) Your reproductive glands were injured by masturbation, leading to a state of decline. Quickly take "Reproductive Essence" to treat it.</p>
<h3>Case Records of Venereal Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Bone Pain and Kidney Weakness: Searching for Toxins to Strengthen</p>
<p>Residual toxins not cleared, function destroyed.</p>
<p>Patient: Zhang Lijian, 26 years old, from Nanchang, working in the industrial sector. (Chief complaint) — Joint pain, kidney weakness, physical weakness, weak function, loss of vitality. (Medical history) — Mr. Zhang was induced by bad friends to enter a brothel, resulting in contracting a venereal disease. Although it was cured, residual toxins remained, accumulated within the bones, causing frequent soreness. After marriage, he also suffered from premature ejaculation, kidney weakness, weak function, and loss of vitality. He began to seek treatment from me last winter. (Treatment) — In addition to electrotherapy, I instructed him to purchase "John Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Chinese-Western Pharmacy to search for residual toxins and treat his bone pain. Because the root cause of Mr. Zhang's venereal disease was the decline of his reproductive glands, which could not be effectively treated by other remedies, I prescribed "Reproductive Essence" to restore his function. After taking half a dozen doses, his vitality was rekindled, and he recovered to a strong and healthy state, as if reborn.</p>
<p>(2) Premature Ejaculation, Nocturnal Emission, Stomach Pain: Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>Electrotherapy and medication, treating both the symptoms and the root cause.</p>
<p>Patient: Miao Ruju, 38 years old, native of this province, in the business sector. (Chief complaint) — Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, stomach pain, difficulty quitting smoking. (Medical history) — Mr. Miao committed masturbation in his youth, resulting in nocturnal emission. He married too early, further suffering from premature ejaculation. In addition, he mistakenly ate rotten food, resulting in episodes of stomach pain. Various medications were ineffective. He became addicted to smoking, and repeatedly tried to quit, but all attempts failed due to the pain and suffering. He came to see me last autumn, introduced by his colleague, Mr. Chen Jichun. (Treatment) — In addition to the latest scientific surgical painless electrotherapy, I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Remedy" and "Stomach-Strengthening Essence" from Huamei Pharmacy to cure his stomach ailment. He took "Hymetop's Semen-Consolidating Pills" and "Reproductive Essence" to cure his venereal disease. Because "Reproductive Essence" also has the effect of eliminating toxins and breaking addiction, his ailments were treated by addressing both the symptoms and the root cause. Quitting smoking was also safely accomplished.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's consultation hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with Sundays off.</p>
<h3>Clinical Cases of Kidney Disease</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, Shanghai</p>
<p>Neurasthenia and Underdevelopment</p>
<p>Recovering Prosperity and Regaining Development.</p>
<p>Patient: Hu Fu, 39 years old, from Jiujiang, employed in a factory. (Chief complaint) — Thin and weak body, underdeveloped, body tremors, cold limbs, lower back pain, and back pain. (Medical history) — Mr. Hu was born with a weak constitution, prone to worry and illness. In addition, his work was heavy and he was overworked, resulting in physical and mental exhaustion, leading to neurasthenia and the various symptoms he complained of. Last autumn, fearing long-term fatigue and hardship, he was introduced by his colleague, Mr. Na Danzhou, to seek treatment. (Treatment) — In addition to radio wave therapy, I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Essence," a famous medicine for restoring weakness, from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company. His spirits were refreshed and his muscles became plump. After taking half a dozen doses, all his symptoms disappeared. His nerves recovered and his body regained development. Even when encountering heavy labor, he showed no signs of fatigue. The difference before and after treatment was like two different people.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia in Chongqing Reborn</p>
<p>Seminal Depletion and Brain Weakness with a Variety of Ailments.</p>
<p>Patient: Yan Lunde, 27 years old, from Chuansha, working for a foreign company. (Chief complaint) — Nocturnal emission, seminal depletion, brain weakness, insomnia. (Medical history) — Mr. Yan was poisoned by lewd books in his youth and committed severe masturbation. As a result, his semen was depleted and his brain was weakened, leading to a variety of ailments. By the time he realized the harm and stopped, it had already developed into nocturnal emission. At first, he would ejaculate with dreams, several times a month. Later, he would ejaculate without dreams, several times every ten days. His body was depleted and tired, making it difficult to bear the weakness. He began to seek treatment from me. (Treatment) — I diagnosed that Mr. Yan's seminal gate was loose and his reproductive glands were also weak. I immediately prescribed "Hymetop's Semen-Consolidating Pills" and "Reproductive Essence," which he purchased from the Chinese-English Pharmacy. After taking them, the effect was significant. He then took them continuously for a month with peace of mind. His nocturnal emissions soon stopped, his semen became abundant, his brain thrived, and his ailments disappeared. His body recovered to a level of strength he had never had before.</p>

<h3>Killing Without a Blink</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>In these times, what does killing a person or two matter? Under a single bomb, hundreds, even thousands die at once, and we regard it as if it were mere statistics, without being moved in the slightest. What is the reason for this? Clearly, war has made our hearts extremely cruel, hasn't it?</p>
<p>But are our hearts truly cruel? I think not! Perhaps when we see hundreds of thousands of deaths in the newspaper, the detailed, gruesome details are missing. If they were recorded, would we really cry out, "Ah! Ten thousand died!" in such a casual tone?</p>
<p>Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," when brought to the silver screen, gave people a very deep impression of the cruelty of war. This is largely the reason why the warmongering Hitler wanted to ban it.</p>
<p>If we are indifferent to collective death (!), how much more so to individual death? We hear people say: so-and-so was shot to death in such-and-such a place, and we are not moved in the slightest. Yet, we often see in the newspaper that a robber, before being executed, is pale-faced, walks weakly, and is, of course, in a state of mental stupor. A priest is even praying for him, and this pitiful scene truly makes it hard to breathe when reading about it. Why do people have to kill people?</p>
<p>The so-called important criminal Hauptmann, of the Lindbergh kidnapping case, was killed by being electrocuted three times in the electric chair. Let us read the news report: "...The right leg of his pants was torn to facilitate the placement of the electrode. After Hauptmann was seated in the electric chair, the executioner Eieler and his assistant immediately wrapped the wet electrode around his body. Twelve witnesses and six journalists were in front of the electric chair, listening quietly to his last words... Then, he flipped the switch, and after a sound, Hauptmann's body curled forward..." Enough! "The wet electrode was wrapped around his body," "Hauptmann's body curled forward," and there were people listening quietly to his last words. What a great and solemn scene of watching death! I really can't bear to finish reading it.</p>
<p>Finally, I must state that I am not a humanitarian in the narrow sense. We know that these "people killing people" tragedies will not disappear until society is completely transformed. Let us strive to transform society to perfection!</p>
<h3>Opium Den for Sale</h3>
<p>— Ma</p>
<p>After navigating thirty li of waterway against the wind, the boat arrived at the tomb area, and the sun was already setting. If it were a smooth journey with the wind, it would have been time to turn back. My uncle was an old addict, and on the boat, he was already yawning incessantly. He hardly resembled someone who had travelled this waterway often, asking the boatmen whether they had passed the Ten Li Pavilion or the Wu Li Pond. It was as if the narrow cabin could not accommodate his slender body, and he kept shifting from the cabin to the front of the boat, and then to the bow. But at the bow, there was a strong wind, and the two boatmen were tightly gripping the oars and poles in the front and back, seemingly too busy to answer my uncle's questions. Despite their efforts, the boat seemed frozen in the middle of the river, not moving an inch. The banks were all fields, with nothing to see except for dilapidated thatched pavilions every five li, for the use of travelers to rest. Although I was also worried about when we would reach the tomb, as bandits often appeared on this waterway after dark, I did not have the courage to ask the boatmen, and what would be the use?</p>
<p>My uncle went from the cabin to the bow and back to the cabin a dozen times. He gradually became exhausted and lay down on the bunk, tapping his feet. He wanted me to search his briefcase to see if I could find something to satisfy his craving. He always carried this briefcase when he went out, and often hid a little bit of his private stash in the bottom or in the seams. But today, due to my grandmother's urging, he did not have time to prepare that most important nourishment. So he began to curse my grandmother. At that time, my uncle had completely lost his human rationality and was controlled by that poison.</p>
<p>When the boat arrived at the tomb area, he told me, "Ask the tomb keeper if you don't understand anything," and hurriedly went to the opium den for sale with a tenant farmer. After a full hour, the registration was complete, but my uncle still had not returned. The sky was gradually darkening. Since we could not sail at night, we naturally had to find a place to stay first. So I asked the tomb keeper to take me to the opium den for sale.</p>
<p>It was probably a cloth market. In a corner, there was a low-lying tiled house with an oil lamp at the door, with three red characters written on it: 售吸所 (Opium Den for Sale). It was said that it was open to the public. As I walked in, a thick smell of smoke assaulted my nose, almost causing me to gag. Walking into the inner room, it was completely filled with smoke. I only heard a hoarse voice calling out that the young nephew had arrived. At the same time, a hand pulled me over. When I bumped my buttocks against something hard, I realized that it was a wooden bed. My uncle was sleeping there with his eyes closed. My uncle was already fast asleep. The person who called me the young nephew called him awake. He immediately became energetic again. He asked me if the sacrifice was over and if the boatmen were ready to set sail.</p>
<p>I did not answer. The tomb keeper then said: "Second master, it's getting dark. Should we stay at the tomb house tonight or find an inn? I'll go back and prepare the bedding."</p>
<p>My uncle coughed, as if he didn't trust him, and said, "Is it already dark?" Then he nodded, "Prepare a bed for the young nephew."</p>
<p>Just as the tomb keeper walked out, two people staggered in, shouting at the door. The hoarse voice immediately greeted them with a smile, offering tea and cigarettes. The two people scanned the room and pointed at my uncle, asking him a question. He bowed and replied: "Don't you recognize him? This is the second gentleman. He has a license." My uncle also sat up from the bunk at that time. He then introduced the one in the lead: "This is Chief Zhu."</p>
<p>Chief Zhu and my uncle started talking and got along immediately. The two of them began to smoke at opposite ends of the bunk, as if they were old friends. The owner brought tea, handed over towels, and kept busy.</p>
<p>After eating dinner at the opium den for sale, my uncle said that he would stay there when the tomb keeper came to take me to sleep, and that he would call me when the boat was ready to sail tomorrow.</p>
<p>I did not sleep well that night. My nose felt blocked by something and was not very comfortable.</p>
<h3>Disgusting Woman</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>The spring breeze blew like a reptile, and Lilai, who had not slept all night, seemed to regain her spirits after getting into the car. She recalled what had happened last night, it seemed like a century ago, and she almost didn't believe that she would have fallen so low. She looked up at the sky, which was a azure blue. The sun was developing its heat, shining the world completely under its light, without baseness, without dirt. As Xinlai thought this, she felt as if she had been reborn. She opened her handbag, wanting to check her face in the small mirror, but when a roll of colorful banknotes reflected into her eyes, she sank into the carriage as if she had lost consciousness. "That disgusting woman!" It was as if countless venomous eyes were focused on her.</p>
<p>The car stopped in front of her house. She paid the fare and leaned against the door frame. She imagined her father's angry face and her mother's tearful sorrow. She wished that she could just die like this right now! So she closed her eyes, as if expecting the arrival of the god of death. But the door suddenly opened, and she fell into someone's arms; it was her mother.</p>
<p>Her mother had a sorrowful face, just as she had imagined. She had not raised a son, and she said that it was because she had committed sins in her previous life. But her husband did not think this way. He loved his daughter like a son. He sent his daughter to school. But in a war, he lost his job. Under the torment of difficult times, he was finally persuaded by a roommate to send his daughter to the dance hall. However, he told his daughter: This is a last resort. I don't want you to earn this kind of money to support me. As long as your father finds a job, you can still go to school. He patted his daughter's shoulder with shame. His daughter saw tears in her father's eyes for the first time.</p>
<p>So her daughter endured various insults and became a dancer. She turned from bright days to a dark hell. But she always remembered her father's words. She did not see herself as a dancer. She only went to earn every dance ticket in a legitimate way. She looked forward to the arrival of happiness, to being the daughter her father wanted her to be.</p>
<p>Now she cried in her mother's arms. She had disappointed her father too much, although it was not her own sin. In that dark hell, venomous beasts lurked everywhere. How could a girl resist the oppression of this harsh environment! She slowly followed her mother into the bedroom. Her father only looked at her whole body with fiery eyes, as if he wanted to see through the dirt on her body. Her mother held her daughter tightly and said gently: Ask her properly. You only have this one daughter!</p>
<p>"Hmph! I don't want her to see my face again. I don't have such a shameful daughter!" He searched in the drawer and took out a pair of scissors and threw them in front of his daughter: "Otherwise, just die for me!"</p>
<p>The daughter looked at her father's fiery eyes, and she couldn't help but cry again. How had her father taught her? She didn't want to explain to her father. She only hoped to die sooner. If her life didn't end, she would always be subjected to that kind of insult! She suddenly jumped out of her mother's arms, wanting to grab the scissors and commit suicide, so that she could keep a clean soul.</p>
<p>Her mother immediately stopped her daughter, stomping her feet and crying, "What sins did I commit in my previous life that even a daughter has to be forced to death!"</p>
<p>Thus, the father turned pale with anger, and pushed his daughter away frantically, almost like declaring war on an enemy. When the daughter fell to the corner, the banknotes in her handbag fell to the center of the room, the colorful banknotes like the faces of wild beasts.</p>
<p>The father's tears fell from his eyes again. He beat his head with his fists, like a madman, seeming to kick and trample on the scattered banknotes...</p>
<h3>Nora (20)</h3>
<p>— (Illustration by Wan Chao Chen) (Description by Xin Xin)</p>
<p>After Mrs. Lindon left, Helmer was being affectionate with Nora, when Dr. Rank came. Helmer: (muttering) Annoying, what's he doing here at this time? (aloud) Wait a moment! (opens the door) Come in, you're so good, never refusing to enter a house.</p>
<p>Dr. Rank happily enjoyed the evening. Before leaving, he asked for a cigar, which Nora lit for him. After saying "I hope you sleep well" to each other, he nodded and left.</p>
<p>Helmer went to open the mailbox. On the lock of the mailbox, he discovered Nora's hairpin.</p>
<p>After taking the letters back, they found Dr. Rank's calling card with a black cross drawn on it, a calling card foretelling his own death.</p>
<p>Although Nora had made up her mind to let Helmer see the letters, Helmer was very disappointed to receive the news of the death of his dying good friend, so he took the letters and went straight back to his room.</p>

<p>Opening: "Night Rain on the Xiaoxiang"</p>
<p>Clouds swirl and envelop the curtained chamber. The moonlight is dim and hazy.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>A thick haze surrounds the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. A few cold and desolate green gauze windows. The whistling sound of a thousand tall bamboo stalks. Several branches of thin crabapple trees with green grass. A listless and melancholic young woman. Two small, lonely maids. All one sees is, a thin, sheer silk dress. A sallow, thin, and wan face. Eyes gazing, eyes filled with sorrow. Brows furrowed, brows filled with resentment. Quietly sitting on a Xiangfei couch. Softly leaning against an ivory bed. A dimly lit, half-burnt candle tear. A cold, icy, half cup of medicine. Pitifully, she gasps for breath. Her heart is restless. She coughs repeatedly. Tears stream down her face. Bloodstains soak through her thin silk dress. Her feelings are intense and apprehensive, sighing again and again, lamenting her desolate situation. Pitiful me, separated from my homeland. Lonely and isolated in a foreign land. The road is long, thousands of miles away. The white expanse makes it impossible to see my old home. A vague feeling that the Yellow Springs are near. It would be better to seek an early demise. Look at her, spirit dazed, all thoughts empty. Lonely shadow, all things are vicissitudes of life. All one sees, the night is deep, the night color is miserable. The sound is quiet, the sound of sorrow is long. All one hears is, the wind rustling, the wind cold. The rain is drizzling, the rain is heavy. Dripping sound of the copper pot that never stops. The clanging sound of the iron horse. The gentle thud of the wind moving the curtain hooks. The pattering of raindrops hitting the cold windows. Ding-dong, the bell rings three times. Dong-dong, the signal tower strikes the fifth watch. That concubine is, unable to withstand the cold wind. The long night, the night rain breaks her heart. From now on, the sickness will enter her very bones.</p>
<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening</p>
<p>Hangye (1180) 11:15 AM to 12:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: Romance of the Western Chamber "The Long Pavilion"</p>
<p>Parting and reunion, joy and sorrow, with a cup of wine. A banquet is set up at the long pavilion to bid farewell to the autumn scholar. Only because the Madam forced him to take the test. He had to go to the capital for a trip. Only seen outside the sky the green clouds with hating shadow. Yellow flowers filled the ground with sad thoughts. I thought Liang Hao ascended to heaven at an old age. Sooner or later, it is difficult to defy the mandate of heaven. I steadily climb the osmanthus tree in the moon palace. I vow not to return without a name on the golden list. Brother ah. Take care of yourself in the windy and snowy inns. Do not rush your horse on the long journey. The horse walks slowly. The carriage closely follows. The setting sun urges with a whip. Do not think of the beautiful spring scenery of the capital. Return to your hometown with honor and glory. Good things are often difficult, as the saying goes. Do not hang misfortune on your chest. You should entrust your message to the fish in the river and the geese in the sky. I eagerly await the good news of the gilded announcement. Inexhaustible. Thousands of words of concern. That forbidden. Disturbed dust blown to face. The most painful thing in life is separation. I will send you a thousand miles and we must separate. Two hearts will follow each other in dreams tonight.</p>
