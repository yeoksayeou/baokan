<p>（東京）有田外相廿八日招待駐京外國新聞記者時其聲明書如下、日本之外交方針、於今年四月廿五日會見諸君時、已詳細說明、惟自余就任外相以來、為確保東亞之安定、曾首先期望中日兩國間國交之調整、不幸此企圖未有何具體成果、致諸種懸案於中日兩國間、徒增陰鬱之空氣、而於八月二十四日在成都之日人二名突為狂暴之兇徒所殺害、其他二名亦因此而負重傷、當該事伴在南京開始交涉時、北海汕頭漢口上海等對於日本軍人官員及留華日僑、相繼發生若干之不幸事件、從來中國當局對於取締排日、曾一再發表聲明、並允諾取締、然回顧邇來之十個月內、對於留華之日本國民以兇惡之手段加以危害、其數頻甚、卽其中之主要者亦已有十餘件、於是在華多數日人之生命財產、遂感受非常之威脅與深刻之不安、然此類不祥事件、當然歸結於多年國民政府並國民黨難免其責之排日敎育、煽動排日等之排日政策、尤以其中之如華方所謂或為共黨分子之中日離間策、亦未可知、但當解决此類不祥事件時、如華方僅目為普通之殺害事件而謀解决事態、實難滿足更因進而防遏此等不祥事件之再發、實不能不追溯其根本而者慮對策、卽為保障將來計、華方應消極勵行取締排日抗日、（至於敦睦令之不發效力可以現在之事態證之）積極謀兩國國交之調整、以剷除排日抗日之根源、甚且對於共黨之措置、亦不能不加考慮、帝國政府依上述主旨、對於此類諸事件之各個問題圖謀解决、同時對於調整國交問題、今特與南京政府在交涉中、惟其前途遲無進展、而其間復於他方又有發生新不祥事伴之事態、日本方面務希望以外交交涉平穩解决俾可達到眞能確保東亞之安定、然國內及留華日僑間交涉無用論、早已盛行抬頭、此為諸君所知者、然而交涉縱令中止、在華多數日人之生命財產、當然不能再置諸不安之狀態、故其時之措置、似不能不另行考慮、至於此次交涉之結果、於中日關係、實不出非常良好或非常險惡之二途、故不能置諸如向來之噯味態度、因此華方於此際、實站於是吾採擇與日本握手之重大歧途、惟余希望中國排除萬難與日本握手、（廿八日同盟社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外相有田今日發表冗長之言論、據謂志在以日本之態度昭示全世界、其中有中國現已臨關係重大之歧路口、及無論中國有若何困難、須加銷除、余殷切希望中國握吾人之手、而作友好之報答、目前中日談判之結果、非使兩國關係益見轉佳、卽為益見惡化、處現有之情勢中、未許中國再如往日以曖昧之狀態而事延宕等語、外相言論之强硬、實出人意料、乃在外務省接見外報訪員四十人時所發者、今將其宣言之主要點、及後答各訪員之問話、紀錄於下、</p>

<p>（巴黎）政府在國會提出之新貨幣法案、大要可分為下列七點、</p>
<p>（一）一九二八年六月二十五日貨幣法、規定每一法郞含九成金〇〇六五五公分、又法蘭西銀行有收受紙幣兌付現金之義務、以上兩項規定均予廢止、</p>
<p>（二）法郞今後之金成分、當另行頒佈命令規定之、但每一新法郞含金重量、不得少於〇〇四三公分、並不得多於〇〇四九公分、換言之、卽依法郞原値、貶低至少為四分之一、至多三分之一、</p>
<p>（三）匯兌平準基金之運用目的、係在調節法郞與外國貨幣之匯率、俾勿踰越上項規定之限制、</p>
<p>（四）匯兌平準基金、由法蘭西銀行代表國庫、加以運用、一與英美兩國現行辦法無異、</p>
<p>以上四項、質言之即法郞在匯率確實穩定之前、暫時停止兌現、至於穩定匯率之舉、則或須俟數月或一年後始能實現、均未可必、大的當與英鎊美元同時穩定、</p>
<p>（五）以每一法郎含九成金〇〇四九公分、計算將法蘭西銀行存金價値重新估定、其所盈餘之數卽一百三十萬萬法郞、大部份撥作匯兌平準基金之用、</p>
<p>（六）紙幣停止兌現後、金市塲自當加以統制、而以統制之責、畀予法蘭西銀行、</p>
<p>（七）凡在國內外藏有金條金貨與金幣者、當於十月十日之前、將所藏純金數量、呈報政府、而由政府抽提欵項、其數額務與金價因法郞貶値而增高之數額相等、</p>
<p>此外、新貨幣法案、又主張修訂薪俸工資、務與物價指數相適合、至於各種公債國庫劵持券人、則可將所持債券調換終身債券、幷酌給百分之十之津貼、（卽債券票面一百法郞可調換終身債劵一百十法郞、）又在本年七月十日至九月二十三日問購買短期國庫券者、則當畀予相當利益、以資調劑、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此項法案並未確定法郞新幣之法定金成分、僅說明法郞之金成分、當於日後另以命令規定云、此層竟不出本社昨電之所預料、同時貨幣法案、規定每一法郞之金成分以九成金〇〇四三公分為最低限度、以九成金〇·〇四九公分為最高限度、按法郞原有金成分為九成金〇·〇六五五、故此决法郞貶值、其所貶低之成數、最小為百分之二五·一九、最大為百分之三四·三六、換言之、政府貨幣法案、倘經國會通過後、法郞至少當跌價四分之一、法蘭西銀行現有庫存準備、的為五百二十萬萬法郞、經貨幣貶値後重行換算法郞、的可得溢利一百三十萬萬法郞、嗣後法郞在貨幣當局嚴格統制之下、仍可繼續貶値至百分之三四、三六之最大限度為止、法郞繼續貶値時、美國與比利時貨幣、根據貨幣協定、亦當隨之而貶値、政府應用此法、可决定法國通貨之表面價値、使與美國通貨之表面價値、同其進退、此外並藉匯兌平衡基金、加以調節、如是則各種通貨、不難達到相互穩定之最後目的矣、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c52">農村生活叢談　廣西大藤山猺民的經濟生活　山租形態及額外貢物 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 俞慶棠主編　唐兆民</p>
<p>每當我走進過山猺的村裏，一些山丁，免不了要向我訴苦一回。說到兇惡的山主，總是搖頭嘆氣。本來，在瑤山社會裏，山主像對建主，山丁像農奴。封建主有的是土地，故政治特權，完全撞在他們的手中；山丁把生命寄託在山主的土地上面，又怎能不受他們的支配與榨取呢？單就山租的形態而論，也就有些驚人：有以產品繳租的，山中所得竟占產量三分之一；有以家禽繳租的，則每屋地一幅或墓地一片，或漁獵塲所一叚，每年須繳生雞二斤；有以貨幣繳租的，大槪須繳相當于產額五分之一乃至三分之一。此外，更有以勞役代納山租的「工償制」；或山主離山地太遠，山丁難於把產品送上門去時，亦有以貨幣折算租物的「折租」；還有一種以人口計租的辦法，卽耕種山塲的山丁，不倫他種地面積廣狹（實則有自然的制限），收獲農產之豐歉，凡年在十五歲以上，六十歲以下的男子，每人須納租銀八角；有些地方，則以戶口計租，每戶須繳納一元—這種類似「人頭稅」或「戶口稅」的山租形態，只行之於象縣所屬的黃鈐，六廟，紅台，落西，和武宜所屬的東溫一帶。這些這些，實在太光怪陸離了。山丁被束縛於山主層層剝削的鎖鏈中，要想掙扎，也無法擺脫。他們說着只有流淚，我們聽了只有長歎。</p>
<p>至於山租的一般形態：物租中間，有分租和定租兩種。一般說來，分租是要比定租盛行一些的；原因是山塲墾殖，照例不能加肥料，因地力關係，故第一年與第二年的收穫量，相差甚遠。因此，額租就不易確定。租地辦法：也有一言為定，也有書面契的；也有不規定租佃的年限，也有規定一定期間。更有永佃制的「永遠長租」。一般以不規定年限為最多，永遠長租為最少。不規定期限的，往往一言為定；有年限和永佃制的，多是書面契的。惟此種契的，什九是請漢人代寫。漢人代他們立契，可以得个「利市」！代筆錢。</p>
<p>有的地方，還有「批頭租」「流水租」的名稱。所謂批頭，就是在租耕山地之前，將一筆大欵，緻給山主，然後訂定租的，定明年限。有的只緻道次批頭，以後便不再繳；有的除繳批頭而外，每年還得另繳很少的租錢—這種逐年另繳的租錢，呌做「流水租」，或對批頭而特稱之為「批尾」。前一種有典質的意味，後一種則租佃性質較濃。雖然這種納批頭的山租形態，能使山丁的身分稍稍提高；但山丁不及獲利，早就拿一筆大欺出去，也就很不合算了。</p>
<p>我曾屢次詢問過山丁，在各種山租中，以那種為合式？這種問題所獲得的答案，總括一句：就是山主方便，山丁吃虧。換言之，卽無論任何山租形態，都使山丁難以忍受。其實山主的剝削，尙不止僅在這些五花八鬥的山租上盡其能事，實際上，山丁除照例繳納上述各種山租外，對山主，還有種種的額外供應。在下面，且錄下紅台嶺桂村板猺頭目趙如香同我訴苦的說話：</p>
<p>「過山猺，做了長毛猺的山丁，便一世沒有出頭的日子了！累到死，窮到死！他們種田，我們種山；他們每到劃毅的時候，便要我們去帮工。我們種著他的山，誰敢不去？只好丢下自己的工不做，去帮他忙，等到把他的工夫做淸，自己的耕作已過了時。……這也罷了，頂可惡的，山主一到我們家裏來，便開口「仔」閉口「仔」地呌，我們就得把好酒好菜待他，儘他吃喝；吃了還不算，見了什麽，只要他遂意，開口就討，伸手就拿，不論雞鴨小菜雜糧，他總得帶些回去，才得甘心。還有，批山的時候，他們又要我們辦「開山酒」；送租時，也要帶一些酒米猪肉去孝敬他。更豈有此理的，有些地方，可種杉木和桐果的，山主還要我們「種木還山」（註一）呢！」</p>
<p>我的性情本就有些急躁，聽他說的太可憐了，便揷口說：「山主，要了租就够了，為什麽選這樣亂來？這眞太不講理了，你們可以拒絕他的呀！」那知他不待我說完，便忙搖頭說：「先生，你不知道他們多惡啦！不給他，不打就駡，有時挨打挨駡不算事，還要挨罰錢呢！山丁不恭敬山主，那是犯「石牌」（註二）的。倘你不從，他會馬上收回山塲，要你滾蛋。」</p>
<p>……我們都默然了一會，他繼續地說：「先生，你聽了這些就生氣嗎？你不知道，有些地方，——比方修仁的六段六定一帶，做山丁的，連討老婆都要納十斤八斤是百十斤猪肉給山主呢！」</p>
<p>趕如香說到這裏，幾乎落下淚來。其實，這段話，不僅他一人如此吿我，大凡是山丁，都異口同聲地如此說的。我想到封建制度下的生產關係，想到領有主對農奴常作超經濟的壓迫，也就只好閉口無言了。</p>
<p>註一：山主批佃一片地給山了，第一年開荒種殖，到第二年春日，山主便要山丁替他扦揷杉枝在地上，任牠繁殖。有的也由山主目己去扦揷，或自己點播桐果種籽。但無論是山主自動或山丁帮忙下種，其保護之責，則全由山丁担任。倘若死了一株，必須要山丁補栽，稍大的樹木，一被鋤死，還要罰幾毛錢。四五年後，樹木成林了。此地便不能再種，便須交還山主。其樹木利益，山丁是絲毫不能分潤的。</p>
<p>註二：猺山有一種原始的政治組織呌做石牌，卽一村或數村乃至數十村，聯合起來，共立一石於空曠之地。以猪為犧牲而祭之。祭後各飲血酒一杯，以示同心。石牌頭（卽領袖）便將規的當衆宜布，以後便各須遵守。山丁階級，有時參加諸事。但無發言權。只憑山主議好，自己謹愼遵守而已。</p>

<p>蚌埠通信皖北鳳陽定遠。懷遠一帶、十壤肥沃、物產豐富、五榖之外、以菸葉為大宗、中以鳳境出產為最夥、農民惟一之副產也、每値秋季菸葉登塲時期、著名之各大烟公司、多派員前來設棧購運。用作製烟原料、而英商頤中烟草公司（卽英美烟公司改稱）且在門台子設有大規模之薰菸廠、於每年秋季收買、菸農收入、綜在數百萬元、農村經濟，賴以調劑、統稅管理所每歲收入　　薰菸稅、最多在六十萬元以上、今歲雨暘時若、菸葉豐收、現已登塲、相繼上市、頃就菸區產銷槪况、分誌如次、</p>
<p>產區鳳陽地方、原產士菸、在民八九時、經英美烟公司買辦之提倡、種植美國種菸葉，並加以改良、菸農獲利頗巨、至民十二三年、種者日多、價亦隨之而高、平均每百磅的値二十元、當時收買菸葉者、有英美·南洋·花旗·華成等烟公司、以後價値漸低、南洋。華成、相繼停買、現在市塲、幾完全為頤中所壟斷、因外資雄厚、華商烟公司、無有與之抗者、產區以鳳陽為最普遍、定遠。懷遠次之、此外如壽縣。宿縣·靈璧·五河等縣、亦有種者、但為數較少、統計數縣菸農、當在四萬戶以上、</p>
<p>播種各縣菸葉、美種最多、士種已逐漸淘汰、播種時在春季三月間、將種子散播於特闢之園畦內、在小滿前、菸苗已長四五寸長、此時移植田間、如栽秧然、菸田須加以相當肥料、俾易滋長、而培壅、耘草、除蟲等工作、亦甚繁劇、菸葉性宜溫和、旣畏天旱、尤畏水澇、</p>
<p>收獲至七月半、葉漸長成、菸農就其莖由下而上、逐漸採摘、置坑房烤之、坑房大者、每次可烤五百斤、小者可烤三百斤、每次須烤四五天始乾、此時運出炕房、置於地上、使稍受露水、俾資柔軟、然後收置室內、以人工揀選、分成等次、運市待售、</p>
<p>產量菸葉每畝最大產量、可達三五餘市斤、產量逾大、質亦逾佳、否則菸質較遜、每畝售菸、收入多者百餘元、少者僅數元而已、至其成本、每畝需肥料四五元烤時需煤的佔二元、合計每畝種收人工費用、平均須十餘元、故菸農有時虧本菸葉登塲後、卽由菸農紮裏成綑、運輸上市，蚌埠設有菸葉行、烟草公司如福昌、大來等家、多就蚌收買、每歲均在九月間開市、此問因最近無人收買尙未開秤、但門台子因有頤中烟草公司設廠購買、現已開秤、四鄕大批菸葉、逐日運輸集中門台、肩擔驢負、箱繹不絕、市面頓形熱閙、社會金融、亦陡見活躍、最近菸葉市似、每担由六元起至四十元不等、因菸質有優劣、故價格懸殊甚遠、蚌埠統稅管理所駐門台薰菸收稅處、就廠收稅、每日收入、茶為可觀、</p>
<p>蕪製門台子頤中烟草公司於收買菸葉時、一面購進、一面覆薰、廠內有薰烤機器、雇有大批工人、逐日在廠內薰烤、分別等次、裝於特製之大木桶內、可以防腐、歷久不變、棧內纍纍，積堆如山、一俟來年春間、卽裝車運滬、製成捲烟、分銷海內外各地、</p>

<p>— 馮列山</p>
<p>由這個條約的內容看來，埃及人歷年來所奮鬥的獨立運動，大部分已吿成功。英人所沒有放鬆的，只有蘇伊士運河區域的軍備權，其餘或多或少　算火大的讓少。埃及是以獨立國的地位與英國訂立這個條約的。此後就算是一個與英國完全平等的國家。經過這條約規定，變方將互派大使。英國將帮助埃及請求加入國際聯盟取得會員國資格。而同時英國更同意取消在埃及的治外法權，　退駐軍至蘇伊十運河區域內。總之，英國人覺得這一次他們眞的是一個再　大不過的民族了！</p>
<p>條約中最重要的幾點如下：</p>
<p>蘇伊七運河駐軍問題英國軍隊不久將開始由埃及內地栘防至蘇伊士運河區城。埃及承認英國的保護蘇伊士運河權。英國駐軍數目規定一萬人。飛行人員四首名，有效時間為二十年。二十年以後如情境變遷，埃及欲收回牛權，這種爭執，將由國聯作最後的决定。</p>
<p>不過英國撤退駐埃及內地的軍隊，也並不是無條件的。埃及政府須在埃及內地　蘇伊士運河區域間建造四條寬二十英尺的軍用公路，三條鐵路綫要改造或舖設變軌。此外還要替蘇伊士運河一帶的英駐軍造舒兵營。等到埃及完全履行這個條件後，英國才開始撤兵。因為這全部交通問題解决後，英國這一萬駐軍在埃及仍有極大的軍事意義。加之，平時英國空軍在埃及境內可自由飛行，戰時英國軍隊可到處駐紮埃及政府無權干涉。可見在軍事方面英國人是不肯怎樣讓少的。</p>
<p>幾個埃及的勝利歷來在英國人支配下的埃及軍隊將全部改組。服務軍隊中的英　軍官將一律辭退，改用埃及人。不過英國得派一軍事顧問團帮助埃及政府，訓練新軍。今後埃及才正式有自己的國防軍隊。惟軍備限定須在不列顚帝國內購置。其次，不但司法權，就是行政權也全部收回。埃及政府內政部中之歐洲，本來是治外法權的一種變相，卽將取消，服務於埃及警察中的英人也將限期吿退。廢除公共機關中之顧問制度。至於原有顧問服務至會同期滿後，或去或留，任埃及政府處置。這一切，就證明埃及事實上已經得　了獨立，並不只一僩名義。因為埃及人已經有全權管理自己的事情了。</p>
<p>此外，還有一點可以看出英人此次解决埃及問題的確具有一種誠意，希望收服埃及的人心，以備對付未來的大難。英埃歷年來談判無結果，多半因為英埃蘇丹問題從中作梗。此次夾人對於蘇丹問題幾乎完全讓步。蘇丹與埃及的關係，將恢復到一九二四年時代的狀况。埃及軍隊卽將開入蘇丹境內。埃及人在蘇丹的地位，也得到與英人完全中等的待遇。這大約可以使埃及人心滿意足的，最少任英國人看來。英國人在蘇伊士運河上經佈置好了一道防綫，最少一二十年內沒有內顧之憂。另一面呢，特別是最近一年來，加入各國的軍備競爭。英國不但是但重工業國家，而且她比別人特別有綫。英國雖然天天在議院中，報紙上大開軍備不足，然而這種論調漸漸引起人家的懷疑。最近德報甚至於指出，英國不漸地增加軍備，是目前歐洲不安的原因之一，可見英國已經凖備到了相當的程度了。</p>
<p>不列顚帝國在未來戰爭中也許要崩毀，但誰先動手去打她的人，不一定會得到什麽便宜的。（九月五日）</p>

<h3 id="c96">公安局發表　破獲萱生案經過　兇犯多係著名積匪　毛王兩犯所供如是 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>公安局破獲萱生案兇犯王振聲·毛永虎·趙雲鴻·等經過情形、已略誌前報、該案　查終結、已將全案解送地方法院訊辦、茲復由該局發表本案經過詳情、照錄如左、</p>
<p>眼綫之告密</p>
<p>本局自上次在儉德公寓破獲預謀繼續暗殺日人兇犯朱貴生·陳恩明·金道權等、訊悉關於暗殺萱生部份重要兇犯、尙多漏網、卽繼續督飭偵緝總隊、嚴密查究、旋據眼綫密報、此案兇犯、多係著名積匪、事前會在趙某家中密議、事後又在華商旅館分配酬報、該眼綫素知該匪犯等、常往中華路沙塲街七十二號張姓家中港動云云、當卽派員帶同眼綫、按址前往守候、以便乘機弋獲、</p>
<p>兇犯之捕獲</p>
<p>該員等守候至本月二十五日下午七時、果見毛永虎跚跚而來、將近七十二號門前時、當卽上前將其拘獲、解送來局、一面仍繼續守候、至翌日（卽十六日）捕來局、旋據毛供、尙有兇犯王振聲、匿居保安支路十號、卽於十七日晚十時、前往查塲街七十二號之張榮福大婦詢問、當知下落、卽又於當晚十一時許、馳往拘捕、適張外出未歸、乃將其妻張馬氏拘局嚴訊、據供王已遷居楊家浜路恭寬里四十六號、復又押同該氏馳往指拘、當將王犯及其妻王汪氏、併解來局、此當時捕獲兇犯經過之大槪情形也、</p>
<p>訊供之大要</p>
<p>訊據獲犯毛永虎供稱、本年六月二十六七號、和李瑞五在趙雲鴻家晤面、李說要打死一個仇人、如有人肯做、可給報酬二百元等語、當時我尤代找人去做、嗣找得王振聲、願意去做、卽偕同到趙家、再和李接洽、並偕同到北四川路去看仇人、李指路上走過的東洋人給我們看、於是我們才知道要去打東洋人、當時王振聲說、這個地方不便下手、遂於次日偕王及李、到其美路去察看、李王兩人、都說這個地方很好下手、所以於七月四號、我到趙家、李卽給我十元、呌我同王去看定其美路保安支路十號、當時付房金五元、七月五日五振聲夫婦、遂由南市沙塲街七十一號、搬至其美路保安支路十號居住、次日（卽七月六日）李關照我、再同王到其美路去看看形勢、我就同王去兜了一個圈子、七日李交給我六輪轉輪手槍一支、子彈幾粒、沒有注意、我將槍交與王振聲、是晚八時左右、我同王到狄思威路其華路口附近、分東西站定、見有日人形同夫婦者二人走過、王卽動手開槍、但扳了幾次、都扳不過火、該東洋人受驚逃去、八日李又送來白郞林手槍一支、子彈幾粒、我也沒看淸楚、遂又轉交於王、是晚八時左右、我復偕王到狄思威路其美路口老地方伺候、旋見有一日人走過、又動手開槍、但又扳不過火、到了七月十日那一天、李又交給我左輪手槍一支、子彈六粒、是晚亦在八時左右、我與王又到其美路賣冰淇淋攤子對面小樹下站着、恰巧有一穿東洋衣服的東洋人、手裏抱了一個小孩、後面還跟着一個小孩、由北朝南、從其美路走到狄思威路東洋花園裏去、約十分鐘方見此東洋人、又從花園裏出來、由南朝北而行、是時王就跟　隨該日人之後、約隔四五步、遂動手放槍、擊中該日人倒在地下、我就向狄思威路逃了、旋卽回到東新橋長發旅館、王亦逃回、我問王、王說已打中了、手槍也丢了、等語、</p>
<p>又訊、據王振聲供述經過情形、與毛永虎所供殆完全符合、對於七日八日兩晚開槍、打不過火、亦已供認、惟對於十日晚之經過、則謂係毛永虎將王藏在身上之槍拿出、卽由毛動手開槍、擊中萱生後、復將槍交向與王、王乃向東逃到胡家木橋、卽將槍埋在橋下垃圾堆裏、然後逃回長發旅館、云云、按七日八日兩晚、旣係由王振聲開槍、十日晚、又係由王身上帶槍、則王所供臨時係由毛取去槍打後、又交還與王一節、殊不近情理、是本案之正兇、當為王振聲無疑、（查該毛王兩犯、所供七月七日晚間八時左右、在狄思威路其美路附近扳槍、打不過火、該東洋人驚逃一事、諒係栗本事件、但係六日而非七日（或係紀錯、）又訊、據趙雲鴻供述、事前接洽倩形、與毛永虎所供無異、事後隔了兩天、趙到華商旅館毛同李瑞五亦來、李在身上、拿出二百元、交給毛、毛抽出一百元說、要交給另外一個人、其餘一百元、即付王振聲五十元、趙雲鴻十元、毛自己取去三十元、又隔了一天、李瑞五介紹一位穿西裝呌做參謀長的、在法國公園與我見面、慰勉有加等語、此之所謂參謀長、據上次獲犯金道權所供證、即為華克之、又查本案正犯王振聲、為毛永虎之把兄弟、而毛父為趙雲鴻之徒弟、趙係受李瑞五之囑托、而李又係啣華克之之密命、是本案之主使人、即為華克之無疑、</p>
<p>起槍與檢驗</p>
<p>根據正兇王振聲供述、卽於翌晨（十八日）上午七時許、派員帶同該王犯、馳往胡家木橋、在橋下垃圾堆泥中、將槍起出、攝有影片、復又派員將原槍送往公共租界捕房騐槍間、會同檢騐經騐明該槍係三二口徑、美國造、六孔、轉輪手槍、脾名司密司、並查得輪內六孔、其五孔尙留有未發射之子彈五粒、一孔留有已發射彈壳一枚、而此留有彈充之孔、適在火針正中部、故可斷定其卽為當時發射之孔、且可斷定其祇發射一彈、亦卽扳機祗扣動一次、但槍輪內所裝之子彈、均為法國造之F．N．牌自動手槍所使用之包鋼皮頭子彈、而非轉輪槍原用之子彈、可斷定其用意在减低發射時之爆炸聲、圖免路人之注意、又在淆惑警務人員之耳目、使難於辨別其使用槍支之種類、又查得槍身外部所烙之號碼四處、均已於事前先行銼去、其銼刀痕跡、尙隱約可見、但彼等不知槍身內部、尙烙有號碼之處、並未消滅也、但於此可以證明、本案兇手、確有極嚴密之組織、並經過極精細之考慮、而後出此、與普通暗殺案、完全不同也、父經試射結果、其彈頭上所着之來復綫綫紋痕跡、曁彈殼底面之羅紋綫、火針痕跡、與當時醫院中在萱生頭部內取出之彈頭、及此次槍孔內取出之彈壳之來復綫、羅紋痕跡、火針痕跡等、經極精密之核對、均屬相同、絲毫無異、故可斷定、萱生頭部內取出之彈頭、確為該槍所發射、（檢騐照片十七幀、已遂法院）、</p>
<p>全案之結論</p>
<p>此次毛趙兩犯、捕獲以後、適金道權等、由捕房送回本局、當卽提金與毛趙兩犯面質、經雙方供認、互相認識、但毛趙均呼金為小王、又呌老三、金亦自承、前由劉老四介紹與毛趙見面時、指本人為王老三、但毛趙又指當時介紹者卽李瑞五、且雙方所述劉李之形象及劉（卽李）帶同金和毛趙見面數次之情形、完全相同、因此始知劉老四卽李瑞五之化名、於此可知華克之所領導之秘密組織、與共黨組織完全無異、僅有直的關係、而無橫的關係、比嚴密概可想見、又查本案各獲犯、所供此次暗殺萱生經過情形、興上次本局在儉德公寓破獲之兇犯朱貴生。陳恩明、在本局所供當時張世民領導朱貴生等暗殺中山秀雄一案、及金道權所供華克之領導朱貴生。金道權。陳恩明等、預謀繼續暗殺日人一案、其用意及策略如出一轍、又查張世民華克、之、均為王亞樵之最高幹部、於此更可設明過去暗殺日人各案、實為王亞樵反動組織之一貫的搗亂政策、本局對於各案努力偵緝之結果、業經洞悉其陰謀之所在、故為黨國淸除亂源計、為本市鞏固治安計、為謀中外人民之生命財產安全計、此後更富聯同租界警務當局、嚴密搜捕該反動組織之餘黨、以期根絕此類不祥事件也、</p>

<p>（七）（五）參加大會的雜感</p>
<p>大會已圓滿結束了、各國選手亦先後賦歸我國這次派遣一百多名代表、萬里迢迢、浩浩蕩蕩來參加大會、結果全軍覆沒、慘敗而歸、記者親歷其境、刺激良深、眞是有說不出的感慨、</p>
<p>關於民挨健康我國這次參加的代表、已經可以說是集全國的精銳、可是走到這世界競技塲中、同各國選手相較、技術的懸殊、固有霄壤之別、而體格的不如、　令人怵目驚心、無論在那一個競技塲中、我國選手與人家一比、立刻可以感覺到人家是那憐高大强壯、我們則如此矮小柔弱、比賽的勝負、幾不待角逐而可預知、譬如說中英足球賽、我們球員的技術、决不弱於英國、上半時的結果、果如預料、不失一球、但是經四十五分鐘劇戰後、隊員一顯露疲困之態、下半時連失兩球、而被淘汰、所以這塲球賽的勝負、不是判於技術的優劣、而是决於體力的强弱、再就籃球賽而論、我們隊員的體格、不但較美國加拿大等强隊相差太遠、就是比日本都不如、王玉增的身材、不能不算高大的了、可是日本的中鋒、比他高出半頭之多、其餘隊員的體格、亦遠不如人、田徑塲上情形、更為顯明、賈連仁參加一千五百公尺預賽、前三圈、跑來有聲有色、與各國名手奮力角逐、毫不示弱、可是最後一圈、人家游刃有餘、衝刺前進、他則精力不濟、節節落後、紛球選手陳寳球、素有鐵牛之稱、在全體選手中、身材最為魁偉、可是雜在各國的鐵牛中間、幾乎使人懷疑他已變成一條泥牛、其餘隊員史可想而知、總之、我國這次參加大會、技術上全軍覆沒、固然是國家恥辱、而體格上的不如、尤應視為民族的危機、我們應該確定今後體育的方針、我們不但要造就許多優秀的選手、尤其要注意到民族的前途、鍛鍊大家的健康、</p>
<p>關於技術之訓練者我們不能在這次大會中、為國家爭取榮譽、我們必然全軍覆沒、這是出國前就已料定的事情、我們不能責備我們的敎練、也不能責備我們的運動員、但是我們决不能把這次的失敗、歸之於必然的結果、而一筆了事、我們必須把這次的全軍覆沒、引為國家民族無上的恥辱、我們不能永遠甘心屈伏、我們必須在技術上力謀進步、在下屆大會中、為國家揚眉吐氣、否則我們就是懦弱、就是無恥、國際的體育競技塲中、正如國際的政治舞台一樣的勢利、八月一日開幕典禮、我國選手列隊進塲時、聲勢的雄壯、陣容的整齊、並不弱於任何國家、可是德國所攝的電影、就沒有我國代表隊的影子、因為他們根本、沒有把中國看在眼裏、我們應該視為國家的恥辱、正如我們被人家侵略了一塊土地一樣的跋直、每項比賽結果、在大會會場中給獎的時候、揭木牌上面的旗竿上、扯起了前三名的國旗樂隊、奏着冠軍的國歌、我們常常聽到十多萬觀衆、隨着樂聲鳴着雄壯激昂的德國國歌、而不禁肅然起敬、我們也看見過殖民地的印度與埃及的國旗、飄揚在揭示牌上面正中的旗竿上面、不禁汗顏慚愧、我們不能在會塲中看見一點中國的影子、聽到一點中國的聲音、我們也應該視為國家的恥辱、正如我們被人家鞭撻時一樣的嚴重、總之、這次我們是失敗了、但是失敗有失敗的什價、失敗有失敗的敎訓、我們要從這次失敗中、認淸我國的敎訓、驟求我們的代價、洗滌我們的恥辱、除非我們不想冉在國際競技塲中顯露我們的身手、</p>
<p>關於運動員之精神者　我國選手這次參加大會、不但在體格上技術上遠不如人、就是精神上也不能與人相比、所有田徑賽的選手、沒有一個人的成績能趕上固有的實力、雖然說旅途勞頓、水土不服，亦為重要原因之一、但是選手鬥志的不堅、究為不可諱言的事實、尤其楚籃球隊、第一戰被日本隊敗後、意志頽喪、精神渙散、幾潰不成軍、我們看看其他各國選手、不論其實力如何、那種拚命奮鬥、非到最後一秒鐘不表示屈服的精神、眞使我們佩服、其次我們運動員的責任心、也應該加以培養、大會開幕以前、德國的發令員、恐怕各國選手不明瞭德國發令的口號、特召集各國參加賽跑的選手、練習發令放槍、各國的選手都去參加、但是我國的選手一個都沒有去、還有一兩個選手在大會期間、因晚間睡覺太遲、第二天竟放棄參加的項目、這些情形、都非痛改不可、我們要使中國體育發展、在運動員方面講、非養成奮鬥與負責的精神不可</p>
<p>關於辮事方面者　世運會範圍的廣大、非親歷其境者、决難幻想而知、可是德國這次辦理得井井有條、秩序非常良好、記者在前次通訊中、、曾以「無人無事、無事無人」八個字、形容德國人辦事的情形、决非過譽之詞、在大會期間、無論在那一部份、我們從未看見一個掛着徽章而閑着沒有事做的職員、也從來沒有遇見一件事情找不到人接洽的情形、可是我們代表團就不同了、奧林匹克新村中國辦事處的電話、常常響了好久沒有人接、選手生病、沒有人去理食、甚至新村裏一再發現共產黨的刊物、而沒有人取締、以這樣一個小的組織、而尙有這許多缺陷、我們能不慚愧、希望這次參加大會後、大會能把德國人辦事的精神、帶回祖國去、這次大會所給我們的敎訓、實在太多了，眞有千頭萬緒、不知從何說起之概、我想如果我們能把上面所說的四點、共同努力的去改造中國體育的前途、無論如何、是可以走上光明之途的、</p>

<p>— （臥佛）</p>
<p>中國人畢竟是不求甚解，隨遇而安的。根本不瞭解天在那裏？天又究竟具有什麽能耐？天與人又有什麽關係發生着？然而，　也把天當作了命運的主宰者，生活的指揮者，什麼「靠天吃飯」，「天命難違」咧，一切都聽之於天，委之於天，歸之於天。我眞不懂中國人對於天的信仰，何竟如是的堅决？</p>
<p>其實，卽使承認是有天的，但天命是絕對沒有的；有的只是「天演」。沒有天命，故天决不會使貧賤者變為富貴，富貴者轉為貧賤，更不會把有志進取者命他墮落，自甘墮落者命他進取。只有天演，才不可不加相當的重視，因為人類的一切，都逃不了天演的原則，天演的原則是什麽？便是生存競爭，優勝劣敗，故在天然的演進下，是只容許你走那奮鬥進取的路，而不容許苟安偸逸的。否則，就被歸於淘汰無疑。</p>
<p>所以，一個人仰賴天命是墮落，多數人仰賴天命是亡國，惟有信服天演，才是進取的，救國的。亦惟天命足以破壞天演，而天演却又足以尅制天命。</p>
<p>我們的面前，就有着這兩條路——天命，天演，諸位對於選擇方法‘似乎不可不加一番審愼吧。</p>
<h3 id="c186">爛毛兒別傳 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>凡住在或到過杭州的人們，對這「爛毛兒」三字，想都已耳熟能詳了。不過這裏所述的爛毛兒，乃是一位「决洋人；」因共節行瑰奇，有足稱者，故為之傳。爛毛兒乃Laumel的譯音。大凡受過高度文化侵略的人們，總是數典忘祖，把外國看做大不得了，因此索性連自己的名字，都要「外國」一下，以示皈命洋化；爛毛兒卽其一，而他的本國姓名，遂反為所掩了。</p>
<p>爛毛兒本是內地某鄕土老兒。自在通商巨埠受過了西洋洗禮，榮歸後，卽鄙鄉間為閉塞，而遷入城中。城中雖比鄉間要好幾百倍，而爛毛兒猶嫌無洋房可住，幸而這時他還沒有見過抽水馬桶！</p>
<p>爛毛兒說話時，常夾以嘰哩咕嚕之音。這，與其說他自示淵博，不如說他已成習慣。譬如他在室裏，外邊有人叩門，他不問「阿誰，」而說「貨；」不說「請進，」而說「刻明。」他去訪人，在外探問時，也不說「喂，」而必說「瞎玀。」諸如此類，他喜歡嘰哩咕嚕如此。</p>
<p>爛毛兒曾下過一筆大本錢，作西洋之遊者年餘。吃過洋麵包，自然與衆不同，卽有人請他做什麽長。接事後，他對全體同事大講其英格蘭，法蘭西；而厠所須一律改裝抽水馬桶，以壯觀瞻，卽為其大政方針之一！</p>
<p>爛毛兒對待同事，一如洋大人之對待西崽，吹毛求疵，時加訓斥。人皆稱之為决洋人Sub－foreigner，因其三句不離英格蘭，亞美利加云</p>
<p>贊曰：「爛毛兒，何所似？次洋人，技止此！」</p>
<h3 id="c187">胡蝶的自白 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 曼子</p>
<p>我看了申新兩報的胡蝶啟事以後，覺得伊已認識了電影楚必須『終身以之』的。在前天，從朋友手裏取到了一張試片參觀券去，參觀伊主演的「女權，」在金城大戲院裏。要明瞭伊半年不在廻光燈下工作以後的表演，是進步？還是退步？自始至終，我沒有疲倦，雖然已經是午夜而快到黎明的時候，正是迷濛於黑甜鄉裏的黃金時間。因為伊在「女權」三十幾個塲面裏，差不多演出了二十多個，這主演的頭銜，眞是當之無愧了。並且從大學生，而少婦，而銀行職員，而女敎師，而女工，各種不同的地位，都應有不同的姿態，情緒，意識，在一言一動中充分寄託，纔能有個分別。伊在每一種地位的轉變裏，有不同的方式，向伊刺激，伊應有不同的應付；而不同應付的結果，却又是相同的感覺，這種故事，雖然並不新奇，而演出却非常困難的。但是伊措置非常裕如，究竟是斵輪老手了。</p>
<p>我的朋友在第二天又介紹我到橱林橋明星公司去，恰巧伊在主演「永逮的微笑」了。的確，伊是永遠的微笑，在一個酒窩裏，完全顯現着伊的和藹。在攝影塲裏，認眞地表演着，雖然時間很長，為了配角的一再NG，」空費了許多時間，而連旁觀者也有些焦急，沉悶，而伊在「OK」以後，還是很高興的和我們閒談。伊問我看過「女權」麽？我說：看過的，伊笑說，假使你在攝製「女權」的時候，來看我們的工作，恐怕五分鐘耐不住的，因為正是大伏天啊，可是我們已成了習慣了。</p>
<p>我在離開伊，走出攝影塲的當兒，對我的朋友說，我已深信胡蝶是認識了電影的偉大了，伊和女權裏的宋嘉玉，是同一抱負的、尤其難能的，是伊比宋嘉玉的處境更安適，而絕不願意為了「兩性的結合，而阻止事業的前進，」我們希望「女權」是伊的自白。</p>

<p>新雨湯彥頣先生，（交大數學敎授，留美碩士，）數度過譚，不恥下交，湯先生近頗愛藝魚，在滬西西愛咸斯路寓邸，陳沙缸六事，豢有珍品金魚多品，一昨偕夫人輩驅車游漕涇，特物色五彩珠魚及藍望天數種，湯先生新有事於北平，歸途託人携有精品十餘尾，均為南中所罕　，而其友輩亦有歡得名祖相要者，於是就近下通也。繼談及於水產生物之治療問題乃荷指示學理，獲益匪解，復告抽　介赴某大學旁聽，不慧幼而失學，長而坐誤，於　魚一道，　得門徑，乃承　　海內同嗜，遠道垂詢魚經，但欲一再硏求，根本實難解答，淸夜捫心，負疚自恧，聖人曰，困而後則學，今能得此良機，自當奮圖精進，用慰師友　般總望之情也。</p>

<p>— 秋蟲</p>
<p>做神仙的先决條件</p>
<p>下面這段文字，雖然類似游戲筆墨，略帶滑稽諭調，却也顯係實情，隱含至理；譬如：淳于贅婿的嘲謔，東方弄臣的戲談，柳麻子（敬亭）笑匠的揷諢，仁者見仁，智者見智，正各具有諷刺的作用，深遠的意味，所謂嬉笑怒駡，主文　諫，幽默的言詞，或竟亦蘊藏着相當的沉痛，充溢着無限的悲憤，由許多辛酸的血淚所鍛鍊組織而成，未必徒以詭辯解頣詼諧入妙見長，更不可盡視為風月淸談，齒牙餘慧，但供嗢噱，無足重輕也。</p>
<p>前人往往將蘇杭比喻作天堂，現在，上海後來居上，十里夷塲間種種富庶繁華的盛况，簡直可數什百倍於蘇杭，大約，當仁不讓，上海無疑的可稱為今日之天堂了。上海旣是天堂，則我們生活在天堂中的人們，不消說得，當然都是些活神仙，最低限度，也不失為牛仙地仙之流吧，講到我們在天堂裏的起居狀况，實際上也的確不亞於神仙。譬如：仙人好樓居，我們有二十幾層的高樓可住；神仙會騰雲駕霧，乘風來去—我們也有飛機可坐，神仙有四時不謝之花八節長春之卉—而我們現在也長年有洋種的瑤草琪花，神仙能搬運千里外的和非時的鮮果—而我們現在也可以用飛機輸送及冷氣貯藏法一一照辦，並且遠涉重洋而來，比他們尤其希罕名貴。再如：火車汽車高速度的飛駛，不就是神仙縮地之方麽？無綫電收音和攝影，不就是神仙的千里眼順風耳麼？機汽脚踏車，不就是神仙的風火輪麽？水面的輪船，水底的潛艇，不等於水遁麼？地下室的任意走動，不也等於土遁麽？（雖然上海還不會像紐的等處有地下火車等偉大工程，但不久的將來，一定可以仿辦的，那就更像土遁了，）冷天有水汀熱天有冷氣的裝設，可以改變氣候，那神仙所炫弄的冬葛夏裘，又顯得絲毫不足為奇了！而且，上海的物質文明，也許還超過天上，許多投機的塲所，新奇的游戲，恐怕神仙見了也要搖頭吐舌，自愧身未曾經，目未會覩呢！我們居然仙乎仙乎的遨遊此間，還有什麼不滿足的？可是，敢問：我們這種天堂上的神仙生活，當眞快活到什麽程度？而大多數的仙侶，為什麼深感苦痛，煩悶，而怨聲載道？難道，這由於人心太不知足，等於呌化子想做皇帝，做到了皇帝又想做呌化子嗎？</p>
<p>須知神仙也有幾等幾樣的神仙，神仙也未必都是快活的！撒金錢的劉海，點石成金的呂洞賓，生財有道，日進紛紛，經濟寬裕，生活舒適，他倆這一等資產階級中的朋友，便不做神仙，也是很快活的。至如那些勞動份子，牛郞織女之流，欠下天帝的聘錢，日夜焦慮，男耕女織，祇忙着還債，又生生拆散鴛侶，一年止能一度渡過鵲橋相會，那種仙家景况，祇怕也就大高而不妙了？尤其是我們讀過幾本死書，單靠筆耕硯織維持生活，被大衆喚做窮措大的末路散仙，所得僅有戔戔苜蓿之糧絕對沾染不着一些兒金銀之氣，似這般辛苦酸澀的生活，便做到神仙，又有什麽樂趣呢！何况上海這天堂，特別是建築在金錢上面，而忝列仙籍的我們，又究竟是道行還淺的地仙半仙，並不曾學得仙家逍遙物外的實用技能，自然愈加應該受諸苦惱了！請看：神仙可以「薜荔為衣」，「芰荷為裳」，我們能乎不能？神仙可以餐風飲露，嘯傲烟霞，或以白石為餌，以日精月華為糧，尷尬時並可飢食鐵丸，渴進銅汁，我們能乎不能？神仙更能幕天席地，枕流棲巖，倚雲而眠，近溷而睡，我們父能乎不能？關於衣食住三大問題，神仙都可以不名一文，從容解决，在我們都不免成為致命之傷，切膚之痛；再加天堂中的生活程度比較塵世特別的高，無綫便寸步難行，而我們這些濫竽充數身無一技之長的窮仙，偏生最缺少的是錢，所以仙境凄凉，神情窘迫，比人間一切芸芸衆生更覺愁苦了！由此，可以得到如下的結論，上海的確不愧是天堂，我們也未嘗不可以做神仙，但是唯一的先决條件，必須充份的籌措一筆的欵，然後方能安處仙鄉，備受香花供養，否則便是法力無邊的大羅眞仙，也祇好仰屋興嗟，束手無策，除非趕緊向呂洞賓先生借一個指頭來！所以，眞正的快活神仙，祇以富貴神仙為限，否則，旣已做到神仙，何必還要學會點石成金的本領？</p>
<p>怪不得近來有許多仙人迷戀著天堂的繁華，憬憧著神仙的快活，而又一寒澈骨，缺少做神仙的本錢，眼中火熱，身上冰凉，一切都可望而不可卽，於是食心大熾，慾燄高　，更顧不得仙家應守的淸規，窮兇極惡，醜態畢是，急得不住的雙脚亂跳，雖蕩檢逾軌，身敗名裂，亦在所不惜了。我因此想釗，上海人口中，流行著「仙人跳」一語，大約就是這個出典？呵呵！</p>
<p>可是，話又得說回來了：在天堂裏做神仙，也很不容易，錢太多了，又恐怕「弼馬溫」「溫元帥」「牛魔王」之類的兇神惡煞，見財起意，用暴力來搶刦或綁票，終日提心吊膽，如處犴狴，輕易不敢越雷池一步，豈不仍舊大大的不快活嗎？好在劉海呂洞賓的錢來得非常容易，不妨稍捨一部份的善財，延聘幾位全副武裝的韋的菩薩，和魁梧奇偉的四大金剛，給他隨身護法，小心看門，旣可以壯觀瞻，增聲勢，更可警衛縝密，門禁森嚴，還愁什麼惡星猛太歲來「綁財神」呵！</p>

<p>他將兩三本雜誌，一齊翻光，忽然得了一個感想。立刻把　關起，頂着下巴　底下，微垂了眼皮，作個沉思的樣子。夢蘭因為他很久沒　作聲，偶然閒轉頭來，看到他那樣子，便問道：梅，你想什麼。友梅依然低了頭道：我覺得章唳天的文字，最感動人。可是他那樣很年輕的人，前途自有無窮的希望，為什麼不說　發憤有為的話，倒是在文字裏面，滿佈了頽喪的意味呢？夢蘭對於他所提的這個疑問，並沒有答復，依然是微昂了頭，作個沉思的樣子。不過現在不是看着墻上那山水畫却是看到窗子外面，天空上的白雲了。友梅放下了書，坐到原來的椅子上，索興對他作一個進一步的質問，望了他道：你看着章唳大的文字也不少了，你以為他那一篇文字作得最好？夢蘭被他眼光逼視着，不敢向她回看，却微微的一笑，在這一笑裏，是給了友梅把鑰匙，把她多日不能捉摸的疑團，完全打開了。便笑道：據找想，你對於他的文字，　篇都認為可以的，還有一件事，你絕對猜想不到的，我們還是親戚。夢蘭倒不免愕然，向友梅看了一眼道：什麽，你們是親戚？友梅道：是的，我同他是親戚。他和家兄，常啊往還。他的老太太是個極慈祥的人，一年我也有幾回到他家裏去。他母子兩人相依為命，度　淸寒勞苦的日子。但是章唳大這個人，很有點美術的意味，屋子裏收拾得整齊乾凈。就是他所住的房子，也是他有意挑釁的，頗有點古趣。夢蘭笑道：那個問你這些。友梅道：你覺得我和他是親戚，有點兒冒充，所以我就舉幾條證據來，證明我不是撒謊。夢蘭道：他除了賣文而外，還作什廠呢？友梅道：他在這附近的進德中學敎書。他担任是高小二三年級的功課，大才小用，他倒是很閑的。夢蘭道：那麽，他不應該淸寒的了。友梅道：你想，敎書能掙多少錢一月？賣文更是有限的稿費，夢蘭道：　他滿紙哀怨之詞，並非是為了　吧？友梅道：那倒不是。他是一個孤子，自幼是母親撫養大的。他對於現在的政治，現在的社會，都覺不大相投。可是他為人性情極和平的，他那滿腹牢騷，無可發洩，就專門作哀情小說。其實我很知道，他倒現在大槪還沒有意中人吧？夢蘭笑道：你們是親戚。說了這五個字，　忽然的把話頓住。友梅撳了嘴道：你這人太豈有此理了。（八〇）</p>

<p>— 李兆璋</p>
<p>（在聖瑪利女校講）</p>
<p>中國人的病態</p>
<p>在馬路上，在公共場所裏，駝背的，彎腰的，精神萎靡的，身體贏弱的，誰都不會否認這是中國人，中國人為甚麼這樣頹唐，中國民族為甚麼這樣衰弱，這是一個很嚴重的問題，外國人是最瞧不起我們中國人的，就是已經亡國印度人也不把我們放在眼內，他們說中國是一個病國，中國的人差不多每個都有毛病，這是多麼痛心的一回事，</p>
<p>中國的癆病情形</p>
<p>中國民族的衰弱原因很多，就中尤以癆病為最大原因之一，根據專家的研究，中國每二十五人中有癆病一人，每十萬人中有癆病四千人，全國有癆病一千六百萬人，每年死於癆病的有百六十萬人，平均每十分鐘內有二十五人是癆病死的，這個死亡率在世界上無出其右，在上海也經專家統計過，上海有十四萬癆病的人，試想由這許多癆病者天天在傳染，天天在蔓延，恐怕不到二年後，我們都要做了的犧牲品了。</p>
<p>郵票傳染癆病</p>
<p>最近有一本美國雜誌內載美國郵政局裏的工作人員，多數發生了癆病，消息傳播，全美震驚，後經專家研究，發現此病是完全由郵票傳染而來的，因一般人貼郵票時多用痰唾黏上去，當中免不了有癆病的人，當郵票乾了後，癆菌就散播出來，因為郵局信件很多，而他們整天呼吸那充滿着癆菌的空氣，所以就得到傳染，癆病無孔不入，至是可怕。</p>
<p>猛虎被癆病所殺</p>
<p>本年春間南市動物園中猛虎遽爾畢命，各方甚為詫異，後經衛生局解剖檢查，發現該虎係患第三期癆病，不治而死，該虎患癆的原因，係由於吃了癆病的遊客的痰而起，瞧猛虎竟敵不過癆病，癆病亦猛於虎，這個問題實在太嚴重了。</p>
<p>癆病的來源與傳染</p>
<p>睡眠不足，飲食不潔，住居骯髒，缺乏運動，心境抑鬰，一切生活缺乏衛生習慣等，皆癆病的主因，與病人同住，同食，共用器皿，接近談話等，皆為癆病傳染的途徑。</p>
<p>吐痰如投炸彈</p>
<p>中國人最不良的習慣為隨地吐痰，為着這是個嚴重問題，所以防癆協會每年都舉辦勸止吐痰運動週，並曾請醫師在南京路一帶取痰化騐，竟發現有百分三十有着癆菌，機關槍手溜彈可致人於死，但隨地吐痰也不就是等於隨地放機關槍手溜彈麼，為同樣的可殺人，可致我們死命。</p>
<p>癆病的預防與療養</p>
<p>每天運動工作定時，睡眠充足，飲食與住居的清潔，心境愉快，與病人隔離分食等，皆預防癆病的方法，但我們不幸覺着胃口不良，白天盜汗，咳嗽吐血的時候，事實上告訴我們癆病已經來了，不過中國人生成就有迷信觀念，有病時祇知求神唸佛，殊不知求神唸佛，病人不但不好，反而天天沉重，中國人這樣冤枉死的，每年總有數十萬，所以我們一發覺上述病狀，應該立刻到醫院去，或請醫生診治療養，可是我最重要的還是預防，因為等到有病再去醫治地，那就危險了。</p>
<p>希望大家合作防癆</p>
<p>外國人常常欺負我們，原因不外我們缺乏了團結的力量，遇事祇有畏縮，祇有偷懶，諸君可以看到在馬路上一般人都把手籠在袖子裏，把袂腳紮起來，這正充分表現我國民族，遇事唯有袖手旁觀，遇着困難祇有裏足不前，這個壞習慣，我們應該改良牠，我們不論男女，應該大家攜起手來，不講空話，不唱高調，並希望大家都有着『不倒翁』的精神，和孫總理那種百折不屈勇敢犧牲的魄力，把我們中國頹敗的民族復興起來。</p>
<h3 id="c192">農村新醫藥衛生推進之管見 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 韓鍾瀛</p>
<p>要得復興農村，雖得各方面的努力，但是辦理農村醫藥衛生，亦為目前辦農村醫藥衛生迫切要務：確為現代各個衛生專家，政治家，以及社會上重要人士所認的事實。因為我國以農立國，農民佔全國人口有百分之八十五以上，農村佔全國的版圖有百分之九十有奇，所以在過去有許多人說：『農村問題，就是中國整個的問題』；我現在也可以講；『農村醫藥衛生問題，也就是整個的中國醫藥衛生問題』；那末，根據以上兩點看來，農村的醫藥衛生重要，農民和國家的關係就可藉此想見了。</p>
<p>談到我國農村醫藥衛生的歷史，是幼稚得很，不過在近七八年來，公共衛生推及到農村去的時候：纔有個新醫藥的名詞產生，也就是新醫藥衛生推行到農村去的個萌芽時期。</p>
<p>因為農民僻居深鄉，新教育困難普及，一般農民未曾受到新的知識灌輸，新教育的薰陶，於是釀成一班頑固的腦經，迷俗的餘毒，深種於腦際；一旦得病，不知延醫診治，同時也無科學的新醫可求。更不知道病中的護理，和病後的處置；完全靠他們久練的銅筋鐵骨去和病症相抵抗，和病魔去爭鬥。若是素來身體不强的，到了抵抗不住戰不過病魔的時候，使病菌的勢力大展，病症加重，於是全家才驚慌起來，張慌失措的懷着滿腔的悲憤和鬼胎，等候死神的光臨。總因獲罪於天，或是攩了神箭，這末求神拜佛，燒香問卜，若是素來身體很强的，或是所患的病症較輕些，一旦就愈，就是佛的靈騐，神的恩惠，菩薩的諭予：若病的加重，甚至於死，總謂；『天生注定，命該如此』；或是說；『閻王呌他或她的死是不會錯的啊』！祇要你踏進農村遇到有這些事的時候，包你會聽到像這類話的。殊不知道的：病是由病菌（能使致病的微生物）所致的，不衛生而得的。在這種形勢之下，幽冥地府不知加添了許多的冤死鬼呢？以致死亡率增高，醫藥費的支出，以及事業的不振興，經濟生產率減低，而造成潰敗不可收拾的農村了。</p>
<p>那末，現在要救亡圖存的唯一的妙法：推行農村新醫藥衛生，是無上的對策；夫新醫藥衛生事業建設的發達，可減少疾病的死亡率，且能促進人民的健康，延長人民的壽命，增加工作之能力及經濟的生產力，以及國家在國際間地位的提高，是一般人不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>的確，新醫藥衛生，在近幾年來，是有相當的進展，顯着的成績。不過常常看到或聽見一般辦理農村醫藥衛生先進者，所遭之困難及累次之失敗，頗為引起一般未服　農村的人，發生尶尬之心理；所以作者學識陋淺，文字粗劣，不揣冒昧，爰有下列的數點，假借本報醫藥專刊，刊表出來，以供擬辦農村醫藥衛生的同志：有個肯定的目標，預防的計劃，來共謀農村醫藥衛生推行的進展。（未完）</p>

<p>— 陳端白</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>李克加這個名詞，比較的還是新鮮的，也許有介紹一下的價值，他在各種傳染病病原體的行列中，是狠晚的晚輩，產生的時期，剛剛廿年，值細菌學衰微的時代，所以更有值得介紹的意義，</p>
<p>李克加無疑的是病原體，可是在細菌學領域內，因他個性特異，與眾不同，狠難給他列入任何一種已經認識的細菌系統，所以決定他為病原體的人，為着暫時歸納的方備，與敬重當初發見此物而捐軀的二個學者，拿第一個學者的姓氏定做本屬病原體的總名，稱它為李克加Rickettsia跟第二個犧牲的姓氏併在一起，稱它為李克加波羅淮察克Rickettsia　prowaxeki發病傷寒的病原體同時也算是Rickettsien屬中一個模楷的代表，Types　spezies（Typus）</p>
<p>（二）歷史</p>
<p>在歐洲大戰發動之後，發疹傷寒也跟着猖獗，當時就有不少的學者，專心致力於病原的探討，經過多少的各種的發現，逐個的被否定，始有第一個李克茲Ricketts氏，（波蘭人吧！當時的無國籍者）</p>
<p>名字將隨着人文明滅絕的末日而始偕亡，較之所謂民族英雄不過限於一時代者貴賤可知，却是在為着人類與大自然生存抗爭而犧牲的當中的一個大英雄，其死也真所謂重於泰山，他的在一九一〇年於被發疹傷寒感染的動物組織內，發見該項小體，（微生物）即現在之李克加，波羅淮察克根據他的生活狀態，確信他為病原體，同時發表他關於墨西哥發疹傷寒的研究，（Tabardillo）為時不久，此英年有為的學者，竟被感染，喪於李克加之手，齋志以歿，可是前仆後繼，波羅淮察克氏Prowals氏繼李氏之後，努力研究，一九一三年發表其該項病原體發見之報告，可是為時不久，也步李氏之后塵，歿於發疹傷寒，洛赫李姆Rocha　Lima繼之工作，在發疹傷寒媒介物衣熱腸壁上皮細胞內，證明該項小體之繁殖，就其生物學觀點與形態而言，跟李克茲及波羅淮察克所發見者，毫無二致，他在一九一六年發表，根據病原性·生物學狀態及形態二點，確認該項小體。為數似細菌的微生物，即發疹傷寒病原體之事實，自茲以後，循着這條路徑而搜求類似病症的病原體的工作者，接踵而起，成功的事實也續有發表，至於今日，我人已得知有數種病症從前因為病原不明者，都為李克加之作崇，例如</p>
<p>落磯山紅斑熱Rockv　muuntain　spo　tted　fever</p>

<p>其他城市，此項事業之已辦有成效者，為却而司登，大拉司，億司登，好司登，洛杉磯，露司弗理，梅非司，米里愛帕立，聖保羅，紐愛克，拿福克，屋克拉何買，聖安土屋，舊金山，華盛頓等。</p>
<p>在北卡羅利乃及愛拉白馬兩城，有全省大規模之保險事業，已在進行，大約在今年年底前，在波士登等城，亦將次第成立。惟會員祇限團體，必須有十人以上同時加入，旦在入會時必須有職業者方可。</p>
<p>紐約醫院服務保險公司，現祇願每星期有五十人加入。</p>
<p>有一五十七歲之紐約老人，當最初有人勸其人會時，曾竭力反對′惟入會後三星期，卽以患極嚴重之肺炎症而送入點院，及痊愈出院時，醫院之賬，僅二元六角。又有一已失業之會風，跌傷甚劇，送入醫院後，經用X光及藥物治療，住院一星期，痊愈出院，不費分文。其他會員之因病而獵免費醫愈者，謝函已如山積矣。</p>
<p>惠康按，以美國人民體育之發達，公共衛生之進步，而每年醫藥費用之結計，為三十六萬萬元，每人平均為三十元，其醫藥之代價，不可謂不高，然人民則因醫藥之保障，民族健康之增進，對於社會之各項建設，均獲猛晋，國家之生產力，亦因是而增加，其富强之來，洵非偶然。試進一　言之，則謂社會國家一切之進步，胥基於醫學之發展，亦無不可一返觀我國，則民族衰沉，國勢叱危若　　，其原因雖非一端，而醫學之退化，實為主要之原因。蓋醫學者，本非消極之慈善事業，實為最高貴之建設事業，而為大衆所需要者。愚年前遊歐，觀夫各國醫事建設之發達，民族健康之增進，為之感羨交并。推共原因，實因醫學統制及調劑方法之成功。如德國已有二千萬人，加入衛生保險，如以每人每月付費為五馬克而言，即每年有十二萬萬馬克之醫藥及建設費，以美國一九三〇年之統計，全年醫藥費達三十六萬萬元，平均每人每年所費為三十元，觀此可知醫學者乃經濟之建設耳，集羣衆之經濟力量，以保障羣衆之健康，同時登展醫事之建設，而其統制之，劑中區，厥為疾病保險　關，或衛生及健康保險之機關也</p>

<h3 id="c198">阿代表得繼續出席 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>近據日內瓦電，國聯國書委員會，已决定阿比西尼亞代表團，得繼續出席，並享受會員國之權利，故一般人皆信義大利之退出國聯，恐難避免，當阿代表赴日內瓦欲出席國聯會議時，國聯方面，對於這事，極感棘手，頗有左右做人難之勢，現在國聯國書委員，竟决定阿代表團得繼續出席，不但是為阿國爭一口氣，也便是為國聯爭一口氣，這也算國聯近日最差强人意的一件事。</p>
<p>假定此次國聯不准阿國代表團出席，非特國聯的威信何在？而國聯的大會，開亦等於不開，因為國聯不是曾經决議意國為侵略過麼？不是曾經　意實施經濟制裁過麼？不是曾經否認武力佔領他國土地過麼？現在國聯對於意國實施經濟制裁，難已撤消，但是决議意國為侵略國，否認武力佔領他國土地，並未撤消，則阿國事實雖等於淪亡，而阿國的名義，依舊存在，國聯當根據怎樣的理由，而不准阿國代表團出席？</p>
<p>假定此次國聯准許阿國代表團出席，義國必極表憤懣，將　極端，此亦　計中事國聯豈有不知，然則國聯何以能深明大義，情願得罪强橫而有絕大勢力之意國而匡助名存而實亡的阿比西尼亞呢？我想其中一定有些道理，第一種假定此次顧慮意國之退出國聯而不許阿代表出席，非特國聯的面子不過去，而氣吞雲夢的意國，更不放國聯於眼中，以後對付意國更是不易，不若稍存體面，毅然絕然，决定阿國代表團得繼續出席國聯，此一義也。</p>
<p>有聞該委員會曾召集數次會議，除上項决定外，更議决關於阿國代表團國書之正當與否，不得請求海牙國際法庭，加以裁定，因阿方代表既已許可其暫時出席大會，如此足以使問題益趨複雜也，又阿代表團對於代表資格審查委員會報告書，所聲敘之某種理由，不能不提出保留者，蓋因此項理由，實與不承認武力佔領土地一項原則抵觸故也，若根據這兩點觀之，此次國聯决定阿國代表能出席大會，還是一種手法，一則曰「暫時出席大會」，二則聲敘某種理由，和不承認武力佔領原則相抵觸，所謂某種理由，是何等樣的理由？難不得而知，但既與武力佔領原則相抵觸，則某種理由，對於阿國不大有利，亦可想而知，若照兩點看來，阿國的出席代表亦不過暫時而已，所以意國墨索裡尼沉著應付環境，而不極端立刻退出國聯，亦有道理。</p>

<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>在××飯店做侍者的陳倚石，和他底　　　同　的　天化合住了一所樓房。陳倚石是個瘦削個子的二十七八歲的人。生活把不十分深刻的傷痕，　　在他　黝黑的帶著南方人底變悍的三角臉上。他底上肢和下肢顯示這個非常難於悅</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>目的不相稱。——畸形的發育使他底下肢强健過上肢。當他走路的時候，每每會使人想起一隻長脚公雞走路的樣子的。</p>
<p>九月底江南，初秋已經把微凉的軟風撫慰若人們。可是他還穿着那单薄的白制服。我們現在是第二次會面了。第一次的會面我們是輕輕地把它放在寒喧的敘話上面。</p>
<p>我和他曾經在香港一家葡萄牙人（我們大都稱呼葡人為「鹹蝦撑」的開設的西菜館做過同事。我記得他每逢在錢用光的時候，就有一個有趣的印象出現在我底眼前。——</p>
<p>「耶蘇愛我，我愛——」他張開兩手，似乎感覺什麼都已絕望了，於是，把腦袋仰起來唱着。</p>
<p>「唉，天父呀——」接着說下去的，便是埋怨自己用錢的不節儉，和追悔他底汗血錢浪費在不正當的用途上。</p>
<p>「到我底住所去玩玩吧。」他訥訥地說。一邊說，一邊又把雙手來扯了扯他底制服底下擺。</p>
<p>沿着北四川路，我們沉默地走了一大段的路。九月底中旬末，我們有着一個難忘的痛心的日子，然而，人們却健忘了。食品店底櫥窗上，應時「月餅」很容易地吸引了一些行人底視綫。</p>
<p>「也許過中秋節會減輕一點我們民族底悲哀吧。」我想不出適當的辭句來表白我底感想，我說得那麼地呆笨，那麼地拙劣。</p>
<p>「癆病鬼唱鼓詞——」他楞了我一眼，嘴唇略略掀動了一下，下面的一句話，「死到臨頭還作樂」，就好像心照不宜了。</p>
<p>我是惘然的，每次走過北四川路心就會沈鬰起來。因為我不能全然地知道這條所謂「神秘之街」，空間是屬於哪一個主人的。</p>
<p>折入東武昌路底一條湫隘小巷，這裏，似乎又展開了另外的一個世界。——空氣很惡劣：便溺底臭味和垃圾堆上蒸發出來的觸人欲嘔的氣氛，從每個牆角或者是陰溝裏彌漫開來。小販們底各種富於誘惑性的呌囂，混和着無知識的婦人以及孩子們底嘈雜騷音。還有一家由蒙館蛻化而成的小學校，不時傳出一陣陣的歌聲，有一個沙嗓子，超羣拔粹地，很刺耳而且又很清晰地喊着：「起來！不願做奴隸的人們！」</p>
<p>陳倚石底住所就在那學校底背後，那是一間澹暗的光綫很壞的房間。首先，他給我介紹他底同居者，我把視綫移到那新識者底臉上。</p>
<p>「這是楊天化君。」</p>
<p>他用右手揚了一下對我說。</p>
<p>我們彼此點點頭。我端詳着他底很合致的身體，和一張並不討厭的臉孔。而後，我纔轉向陳倚石，</p>
<p>「一向的生活都好吧，…」</p>
<p>「我們，你看我們還能談得到什麼呢？」陳倚石淡淡地道。</p>
<p>「我們是在地牢里挨日子的。」楊天化搶着說出他底話。</p>
<p>「唉，天——父呀——」陳倚石用唱「西皮」（粵曲中的一種調門）似的音調，無聊地唱了起來。</p>
<p>「天父，丟—你底天父。」</p>
<p>楊天化煩厭地詛咒起來了。</p>
<p>我不明白我底老朋友為什麼還沒改掉他底壞脾氣，這是一個非常丟臉的惡習性。</p>
<p>陳倚石對我背述我們分手後的生活情形。他用手扯了他底制服底下擺，說着。說得很慢，很吃力似的。顯然的他在收羅一切抽象的字眼，以避免關於現實底不幸運的記叙。</p>
<p>「阿楊說得不錯，我們是在地牢里挨日子的…」</p>
<p>然而，他把贊成一切不景氣的原因忽略了，祗是若所有感地嘆着：</p>
<p>「命不如人人自卑。」</p>
<p>那是錯誤的。我始終都不同意於他們底主張。最使我引為憾事的，他們把生活底優與劣的操縱權付之於「命運」。其實與生活能有密切關係是我們底社會。內憂外患使社會墮入不安寗的泥潭里，而間接地挨到我們底生活上面，於是，它就呈現着暗茫的灰色了。</p>
<p>我們把談話繼續了足有半天之久，最後，陳倚石結納地說：</p>
<p>歸根是一句話，生活是建築在金錢底上面的。我們缺乏錢，所以我們底生活也就枯痛了。</p>
<p>使我奇怪的是這回楊天化也同情陳倚石底話，「我們最難解决是錢底問題，是的錢！…」楊天化好像覺得他底同居者底理論很充足，說話時，眉宇間流盪着得意的神采。</p>
<p>「假如有人給錢你，敎你去做漢奸，你去不去呢？」</p>
<p>我想不出更冷酷而簡捷的話來說服他們了。</p>

<p>— 允海</p>
<p>極度不安地人們是過了第五天了。</p>
<p>他們這一伙每天從太陽出來的時候，等着到太陽給他們一個侮辱的恥笑，而后在西山溜跑，老是在不寗靜的心緒下蹀踐着在海邊。他們在望着海闊天空那一邊，他們所最熟識的那些地方，正楞着出神的時候，免不了又給同伴中的一個這樣地提醒了：</p>
<p>「怎末還沒有消息咧？」</p>
<p>於是，皺起了額上的老紋，憂累地走幾步。</p>
<p>眉毛儘打着結，每一個心都在盤算着那消息，那象生死判定婦女書的消息——不是和波浪拼命着，便是更不幸的他捱在家里等死。一時想着那一線生機：反正在七八個中當中去掉一兩個，說不定彩也摸不到自己：然而——</p>
<p>「該是輪到了，又怎末內吸」？</p>
<p>那還不是看天：看天的雲彩變幻捱過日子，讓饑餓吞蝕自己。</p>
<p>這天，天色不大好，遠處飄來一朶黑雲。整個看天氣便給壓得沉重象鉛一樣，人都給榨得象要爆裂了似的。這邊一排坐着天色的是五個，老五却氣憤憤地往來的走着，剛才是在一番不如意的談話里把大家的情感割裂了。所以，在崗里特別顯得沉悶，和要人命難受。</p>
<p>一會兒，老三暴燥地直跳了起來狂跳着：</p>
<p>「我受不得了，我受不得了！算我看水歇了吧，也得早點給我個訊息，好讓人家想頭路，媽個×，那老烏龜，扒灰老」！</p>
<p>「歇了就算，只要有的是艇，到省城擺橫水渡也不會便這樣的餓死！你媽×，靠你」？</p>
<p>這個青壯小伙子還重重地唾了一口痰到地上。八哥這特別顯得切都很隨便的傢伙，他的隨便性情，是更氣煞人了。</p>
<p>「又還沒有絕望，大家急什末，三哥怕不是你，是我哩…！」</p>
<p>你！</p>
<p>老三不管什末地便撲的一拳，敲在八哥的額上。於是，人們又在吵嚷中過去了這一天了。</p>
<p>第二天，人還是那末地混混沌沌，不是這家打老婆，便是那家拿小孩子出氣。人們在急待着那消息還是風影子也沒有。</p>
<p>傍晚，才算給一個驚奇的新耷刺得大家跳了起來。那新耷，老三知得最早，據他說，是：船老大李老福爹在家上吊了。</p>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「瀟湘問病」</p>
<p>蒼茫暮色漸黃昏。颯颯微風細雨涔。暗淡瀟湘聲寂寂。凄凉瘦竹影沉沉。怡紅公子多情種。想起了多愁多病人。　笠簑衣穿帶好。持燈急急走園林。行來已到瀟湘館。姑娘是，作罷詩章纔擱筆。丫環忽報二爺臨。只見他，今朝打扮非往昔。寳哥哥，何事效學漁翁形。公子聞言忙相間。妹妹身處可安寗。藥可吃，飯可增，近日不可把詩吟。我是終朝心難放。故而胃雨探分明。妹妹若愛此裝束。緩日卽當送一身。顰卿回言何需此。漁婆形像實無名。話出口。暗思忖。漁翁漁婆不該云。桃花面泛羞難掩。默默低頭不作聲。一個是，無意言語偏說錯，一個是，未開情竇豈知情。紅樓一夢多變幻。聊表那，問病瀟湘一段姻。恨月老不牽情絲綫。故使醫藥總無靈，徒負雙雙一片心。</p>

<p>麟記（一二二〇）下午九時零五分至十時</p>
<p>開篇「牡丹」</p>
<p>牡丹花國獨稱王。它那時，綠葉紅花景色揚。富貴獨標奇品類。位居領袖帥羣芳。花神二月花朝夕。譜出嬌顏異種良。曾記得。淸室苛求文字獄。那一詩異稱亦稱王。頓時掀起無邊禍。多少書生為此亡。可憐那，死後還須屍暴露。不敎白骨葬墟荒。而今國事蝴螗裏。昔日文豪誰憶將。吳梅村，逞詩狂。冲冠一怒為紅妝。到後來，滇王三桂把千金買。未許將詩删去藏。所以那，淸室昏君把大獄倡。一紙通行興文字獄。株連多少好先生。憐他屍骨無人葬。狼藉荒郊在亂崗。牡丹詩。實可傷。那胡兒。逞兇强。竟把文人全體喪。雲貴英雄淸室叛。也為那，不堪殘暴毒心腸。可憐　字詩詞稿。遽作千秋碧血章。紫牡丹。特別香。綠葉扶疏把美色裝。三月羣花稱第一。要仙花國獨稱王。幽閒貞靜好芬芳。二</p>
<p>周振玉義妖傳</p>
<p>元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻至一時半</p>
<p>開篇「中秋難月」（咪咪集剏刋號）　　年年月度春秋。日月匆匆似水流。去歲秋月猶在目。今年八月又臨頭。想今日，十五月半中秋節。只見那，一輪明月照高樓。雲淡月圓頻添媚。恨不得，效學明皇月中遊。月兒呀。我看你，今朝月容非往日。我看你，凄凉月色一概收。我看你，美滿月華頻砍笑。我看你，總因為家家慶月樂不休。我看你，雖然月淸明如鏡。我看你，月光難解人題愁。你可曉，幾家歡樂同賞月。幾家凄凉對月憂。幾家見月傷心色。幾家愛月故出遊。幾家是，夫唱婦隨度蜜月。幾家是，日月東西各自謀。幾家是，月下歡聚共開筵。幾家是，歲月奔波到處投。幾家是，快活逍遙邀滿月。幾家是，顚倒日月不自由。幾家宛比中秋月。幾家好似殘月鈎。我想那，圓月到頭難免缺。就是那，殘月還恐雲來囚。世人怎比天空月。到後來，鏡中之月總虛浮。月缺還有重圓日。人死安能如月再回頭。月缺月圓年年在。人生怎及月長留。何能與月共千秋。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Chiang Kai-shek, on the morning of the 28th, summoned the senior military and political officials to Whampoa for instructions. At 7:30 AM, he came to Guangzhou city, attended the expanded memorial week at the Memorial Hall, and gave a detailed lecture on the ways of cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world. At 9:00 AM, Chiang Kai-shek left the Memorial Hall and went to Tianhe Airport, took a Junkers aircraft back to Nanjing, accompanied by Chen Bulei, Qian Dajun and more than ten others, escorted by four aircraft. After refueling in Nanchang at noon, they continued to fly. Chiang Kai-shek will come to Guangdong again after one or two months. The staff of the headquarters returned north by land in batches. The affairs of the headquarters are temporarily managed by Yu Hanmou. He Yingqin may come to Guangdong to take office in one or two days. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Nanchang: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew from Guangdong by a silver Douglas aircraft to Jiangxi at 9:30 AM on the 28th. He arrived in Nanchang at 12:30 PM and resided in the Lizi Society. Among those who came with him were Chen Bulei, Qian Dajun, and secretaries including Inari Nichisho and Mao Qingxiang, totaling more than 20 people. Xiong Shihui and others went to the airport to welcome him. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stayed in Guangdong for 49 days this time, handling the Guangdong-Guangxi incidents and completing the unification of the country, which is truly a matter for the people to celebrate.

<p>(Nanjing) It was said that the newly appointed Director of the Guangzhou Headquarters, He Yingqin, would fly to Guangdong to take office immediately.

<p>(Guangzhou) At 8:00 AM on the 28th, all sectors of the Guangdong party, government, and military held an expanded memorial week at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall. More than 500 people above the middle level of various agencies participated. After performing the ceremony as usual, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally came to give instructions, stating that Zhongzheng had been in Guangdong for fifty days. During this period, with the joint efforts of comrades from all walks of life, Guangdong, in terms of military affairs, political party affairs, and society, has been on the right track. In the future, as long as we continue to work hard, there will be progress by leaps and bounds, and it will not be difficult to establish a model province of the Three Principles of the People in the shortest possible time. Now, on the occasion of parting, I will give you the fundamental essentials of political construction as a gift. (1) The first task of revolutionary nation-building is to restore order from chaos and establish a new order in politics and society. The so-called "rites" mean order. How can this new order be established? This also requires comrades from all sectors of our party, government, and military who bear leadership responsibility, as well as various agencies, to earnestly achieve "neatness and solemnity" in everything, to influence subordinates and the people, and to change the overall atmosphere. (2) Political construction begins with obtaining talent. The way to obtain talent must first cultivate oneself. The key to cultivating oneself lies in choosing what is good and adhering to it firmly, that is, believing in the Three Principles of the People and practicing them with all sincerity and strength. It is also necessary to be close to the virtuous and respect the worthy, and to promote the spirit of the Premier's last words, the so-called "fraternity, sincerity, and diligence." As for handling affairs, we must cherish time and abide by time. All work must be done quickly and accurately. This is what is meant by "humane and quick administration." In short, the chapter on Duke Ai of Lu asking about politics in The Doctrine of the Mean is actually the fundamental essence of political revolution and nation-building. I hope that comrades will study it carefully and practice it diligently, so as to complete the responsibility of Guangdong's political construction and forever consolidate the foundation of the revolution.

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and then gave a report on the spot, saying that "income tax is the most reasonable tax system in modern countries." The ceremony ended at 9:30 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin said in his original speech at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 28th that China's tax system has always been backward. After repeated reorganization by the financial authorities, it has gradually gotten on track. Recently, the income tax has been launched, which is nothing less than a brilliant stroke in China's financial history. The advantages of income tax are that it is fair, universal, flexible, and has fixed income. It occupies an important position in the tax systems of various countries. There are currently more than 50 countries in the world that use it. The central tax system in China still relies mainly on customs duties, salt tax, and consolidated tax. These three items are all indirect taxes. The burden is uneven. Once the country is in trouble, tax revenue will not only fail to increase, but may also decrease. Therefore, this type of tax system cannot be considered reasonable. In particular, the salt tax, although the direct taxpayers are salt merchants, after the salt merchants pay the tax, they raise the price of salt and pass the tax burden on to the consumers. How can this compare to the fairness of income tax? In short, income tax is the best tax system. If it is effectively implemented in the future, all bad tax systems can be gradually abolished. I hope everyone will promote and support it unanimously. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Ministry of Finance Explains the Income Tax Collection Method: Subsidies are Taxed, Public Expenses are Not <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission inquired with the Ministry of Finance about whether the income tax on the salaries of civil servants should be deducted by the original agency when the salaries are issued, and then remitted by the original agency, or whether it should be paid directly by the taxpayer to the competent collection agency. It also inquired whether subsidies and special office expenses should be included in the taxation, and whether the income donation issued by the Central Party Headquarters should continue to be levied. The Ministry of Finance replied that according to the provisions of the implementing rules of the income tax law, the income tax on the salaries and remuneration of civil servants should be deducted by the head of the agency that directly pays them at the end of each month, and a list should be made, along with the income statement, and remitted to the local tax collection agency. In addition, subsidies are given for official duties and should be included in the calculation of taxation. Special office expenses were ordered to be reported and sold in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and the State Council discussed and decided on two principles for expenditure: "One is limited to agency expenses and does not belong to individuals, and the other is to report and reward sales and not to be paid by the competent personnel." When the budget regulations were promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the detailed rules attached to the subject stated that "all additional expenses necessary for officials to perform official duties are listed under this item, and the expenses are differentiated according to official rank." It seems that the expenses have been transferred from agency expenses to official expenses, but these office expenses, whether for agency expenses or official expenses, are undoubtedly expenses for performing official duties. As mentioned above, special office expenses cannot be listed in the category of salaries and remuneration in the second category of the implementing regulations of the income tax law, and cannot be included in the calculation of taxation when paying income tax. The income donation collected by the Central Party Headquarters has been resolved by the Central Standing Committee to stop collecting it when the government implements income tax, and the Executive Yuan has issued an order to inform it. It has now been consulted and replied to the Military Affairs Commission for reference. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance explained the doubtful points in the income tax collection procedures. (1) All those who are paid salaries by the national and local treasuries are civil servants who should pay income tax. (2) Subsidies for civil servants are given for official duties and should be included in the calculation of taxation. Special office expenses are expenses for performing official duties and cannot be included in the calculation of taxation. (3) All profit-making businesses, except for income of category C that cannot be calculated according to the amount of capital, shall be taxed according to the percentage of net profit to actual capital amount stipulated in Article 3, and the tax rate for salaries and remuneration in the second category shall not apply.

<p>(Nanjing) The depreciation of the French franc and the nationalization of gold have led to the disintegration of the gold standard group led by the franc.

The Economic Research Department of the Central Bank is collecting relevant materials and will conduct a detailed study after the French government approves and announces it on the 28th. However, the changes in the French economic system have little impact on us, but the price of gold will become more and more solid thereafter. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">On "Frugality to Save the Nation" <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Lin of the National Government gave a speech on "Frugality to Save the Nation" at the Central Broadcasting Station, emphasizing the importance of the national economy, believing that the manifestation of national strength lies in this, so the construction of the national economy is indeed a matter of urgency. His argument on frugality is divided into four points: first, saving expenses; second, cherishing time; third, having a stable career; and fourth, promoting domestic goods. These are benevolent words that everyone should admire. At the same time, Premier Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan, when instructing the authorities of Guangdong Province and cities, earnestly spoke about reforming politics. In summary, there are also four points: first, diligent investigation to find talent; second, seeking speed and accuracy to revitalize; third, bearing grievances to achieve reform; and fourth, cooperation to ensure success. Although this may differ from Lin's point of view, there is no difference in their goals. Economic construction must rely on political power for promotion, and political construction must take the promotion of frugality as the first task. The two have common ground. The fact that the two major leaders in the central government have given such important reminders one after another is enough to inspire deep thought, and its contribution is not small. While we are happy to hear it, we still want to elaborate on it and dare to take this opportunity to comment on it.</p>
<p>The extravagant social atmosphere today is an undeniable fact. Chairman Lin's theory of "Frugality to Save the Nation" can be said to be a good medicine for the problem. However, if we want to change the atmosphere, we must start from the top and gradually promote it to the bottom in order to achieve effectiveness. Most of the people are trapped under the pressure of life, and frugality is not enough. How can they afford to be wasteful? Even those who are slightly better off and work hard to make a living may not be criticized for being excessive or decadent. The source of the decadent atmosphere lies in the fact that there are too many people with leisure. Because they have leisure, they do not "cherish time," and even take advantage of their special privileges to despise all restrictions, creating an unfathomable situation. As a result, those who "have a stable career" are unable to resist the temptations of material things or escape the push of the environment, and are unable to adhere to their own aspirations and follow suit. It is difficult to reverse the situation, which is regrettable. If those in power have a thorough understanding and can set an example and use the power of politics to implement gradual pressure, then there is still hope for improvement. Chiang's expectations for administrative personnel also coincide with the meaning of frugality. It is necessary to know that all administrative officials must first have a focused spirit in order to be quick to respond to opportunities. They must first have a unique integrity in order to be able to bear grievances without fail. If you want to form these two styles, what can you seek other than frugality? Only frugality can cut off the privatization of cliques, and only accuracy can save the mind from distractions. The ancient people said that frugality cultivates integrity, which is a timeless truth. Those in politics today should reflect on these words.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Japanese Foreign Minister Hosts Foreign Correspondents: Clarifies Japan's Attitude Towards China, Believes China Has Reached a Crossroads, Cannot Continue with Delaying Tactics, Hopes for a Friendly Path <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita hosted forty members of the foreign press corps stationed in Beijing at his official residence at 3 p.m. on the 28th, holding a tea party to clarify the Imperial Government's attitude towards the current state of Sino-Japanese relations. He also detailed the Imperial Government's view of the rampant anti-Japanese terrorism in China, and affirmed the unwavering peaceful policy of stabilizing the situation in East Asia. (28th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita issued the following statement when hosting foreign correspondents stationed in Beijing on the 28th: Japan's diplomatic policy was explained in detail to you gentlemen at the meeting on April 25th of this year. However, since my assumption of the post of Foreign Minister, with the aim of ensuring stability in East Asia, I first hoped for the adjustment of relations between China and Japan. Unfortunately, this attempt has not yielded any concrete results, causing various pending issues between the two countries to increase the somber atmosphere. On August 24th, two Japanese nationals in Chengdu were suddenly killed by violent thugs, and two others were seriously injured. While this matter was being negotiated in Nanjing, a number of unfortunate incidents occurred in Beihai, Shantou, Hankou, and Shanghai against Japanese soldiers, officials, and Japanese residents in China. The Chinese authorities have repeatedly issued statements and promised to suppress anti-Japanese activities, but looking back over the past ten months, the number of incidents in which Japanese citizens in China have been harmed by vicious means has been very frequent, with more than ten major incidents alone. As a result, the lives and property of many Japanese in China have been under serious threat and deep anxiety. These unfortunate incidents are of course attributable to the anti-Japanese education and anti-Japanese policies, such as incitement of anti-Japanese sentiment, by the National Government and the Kuomintang over the years. It is also possible that some of these incidents are due to what the Chinese side calls the Communist Party's attempts to sow discord between China and Japan. However, when resolving such unfortunate incidents, if the Chinese side only sees them as ordinary murder cases and seeks to resolve the situation, it is difficult to be satisfied and even more difficult to prevent the recurrence of such unfortunate incidents. It is imperative to trace the root cause and consider countermeasures. To ensure the future, the Chinese side should passively and diligently implement the suppression of anti-Japanese sentiment and anti-Japanese activities (as for the ineffectiveness of the edict on friendship, it can be proved by the current situation) and actively seek the adjustment of relations between the two countries to eradicate the roots of anti-Japanese sentiment and anti-Japanese activities. Furthermore, measures against the Communist Party must also be considered. The Imperial Government, based on the above principles, is seeking to resolve each of these individual problems and is currently negotiating with the Nanjing government on the issue of adjusting relations between the two countries. However, progress is slow, and in the meantime, new unfortunate incidents continue to occur elsewhere. The Japanese side earnestly hopes to resolve the situation peacefully through diplomatic negotiations so as to truly ensure the stability of East Asia. However, as you gentlemen know, the argument that negotiations are useless has long been prevalent among the domestic population and Japanese residents in China. However, even if negotiations are suspended, the lives and property of many Japanese in China cannot be left in a state of insecurity. Therefore, at that time, measures would have to be considered separately. As for the outcome of this negotiation, the relationship between China and Japan will either be very good or very bad. Therefore, we cannot continue with the ambiguous attitude of the past. Therefore, the Chinese side at this moment is standing at a major crossroads where it must choose to shake hands with Japan. However, I hope that China will overcome all difficulties and shake hands with Japan. (28th, Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita delivered a lengthy speech today, stating that his intention was to show the world Japan's attitude. Among other things, he said that China is now at a critical crossroads, and that no matter what difficulties China may have, it must overcome them. He earnestly hoped that China would shake hands with Japan and reciprocate with friendship. The outcome of the current Sino-Japanese negotiations will either improve relations between the two countries or worsen them. In the current situation, China is not allowed to delay matters with an ambiguous attitude as in the past. The Foreign Minister's strong remarks were unexpected, and were made when he received forty foreign reporters at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The main points of his statement and his answers to the reporters' questions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Chinese government and the Kuomintang cannot shirk their responsibility for the recent anti-Japanese incidents in China. China should exercise more effective control over the anti-Japanese movement and make more constructive efforts to improve Sino-Japanese relations. For the sake of a permanent solution, the roots of anti-Japanese turmoil should be eradicated. Public opinion in Japan and Japanese residents in China are increasingly advocating that continuing negotiations with China are of no avail. If the current negotiations fail and end, the Japanese authorities cannot allow the lives and property of Japanese residents in China to continue to be in any danger, and it will be necessary to consider final countermeasures. Japan hopes that China will formulate a fixed and constructive program to eliminate anti-Japanese sentiment. At the beginning of his speech, Arita sincerely stated that since taking office (March 9, 1936), he has been diligently working to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. However, this effort has not yielded substantial results, and various problems remain unresolved, causing a haze that makes relations between the two countries increasingly bleak. Arita mentioned the cases of Shantou, Chengdu, Beihai, Hankou, and Shanghai, saying that the victims included Japanese soldiers, officials, and residents. Although the Chinese authorities have repeatedly issued announcements promising to curb the anti-Japanese movement, these have been empty promises. Japanese residents in China have been subjected to unspeakable acts of violence by anti-Japanese elements in China, so the lives and property of many Japanese residents in China are now under great threat, and they naturally feel deeply uneasy. All these unfortunate incidents can be said to be the natural result of the anti-Japanese education, anti-Japanese propaganda, anti-Japanese policies, and other forms of anti-Japanese activity that China has implemented for many years. This is a responsibility that the National Government and the Kuomintang cannot shirk. Merely resolving these few incidents is not enough. The Chinese authorities should take resolute steps to eradicate the root of the problem to prevent the recurrence of these incidents. For the sake of a permanent solution, China should strive to eradicate the turmoil of anti-Japanese sentiment. The Japanese government has been conducting negotiations with the Chinese government in this spirit to resolve various cases and adjust Sino-Japanese relations, but these negotiations have not made significant progress. At the same time, new incidents of a similar nature are sprouting up. The resolution between China and Japan should be achieved as far as possible through diplomatic negotiations by peaceful means, so that the security of East Asia can be truly guaranteed. This is Japan's sincere aspiration. Arita then answered many questions, saying that he sincerely hoped to achieve his aspiration through diplomatic negotiations. When asked if the failure of negotiations would mean war, Arita replied, "The word 'war' is not included in the diplomatic vocabulary." Arita continued to say that he sincerely hoped that China would respond to Japan's friendly attitude. For this reason, he sincerely hoped that China would draft a fixed program to eliminate anti-Japanese sentiment. Now that the Southwest problem has been resolved, President Chiang Kai-shek should urgently return to Nanjing to resolve the anti-Japanese cases and eliminate the root and deep-seated cause of the disaster, thereby bringing Sino-Japanese relations into clarity and making the two countries more friendly. He feared that the Chinese government still did not truly understand the seriousness of the overall situation, which could be discerned from the news reported in the newspapers and the mistakes made in Nanjing.

<p>(Nanjing) Since Wu Dingchang, Wang Shijie, and others returned to Nanjing from Guangdong, the National Government has convened the head of the Executive Yuan to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue. Based on the results of today's meeting between Director Gao Zongwu and Ambassador Kawagoe, it will re-discuss the issue at tomorrow's Executive Yuan meeting. After a concrete policy is decided, it will be decided by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and then there may be some expression of intent towards Japan. Therefore, the direction of Sino-Japanese negotiations will not be clear for another four or five days. (28th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Zongwu, acting on a major mission from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, visited Ambassador Kawagoe at the official residence at 3:00 p.m. today to exchange views on Sino-Japanese negotiations. The meeting lasted for one and a half hours before he left. (28th, Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the Manchester Guardian published an editorial criticizing the five demands that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, is said to have made to China, including the right to station troops in certain places along the Yangtze River to protect overseas Chinese. The editorial stated that in addition to the usual demands, the Japanese side has now added this new clause with threatening implications, which may result in Japan extending its influence to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou. The Chinese side will naturally not accept this clause. However, it must be known that this bargaining is only just beginning. After the incident in which a Japanese sailor was killed in Hongkou, the Japanese expressed restraint on the Shanghai case after the first day of激昂. However, it seems that the Japanese intend to take advantage of this unexpected incident to profit from it, which is unfortunate. Those with historical knowledge will be uneasy if they recall that when the Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931, it coincided with the British government's decision to abandon the gold standard.

<p>(Tokyo) According to sources here, the Japanese Army and Navy, and other provinces that pay attention to Japan's expansion into the South Pacific, have decided to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hold public negotiations with the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, so that the two places will lift their restrictions on Japanese immigrants. It is reported that this decision is the result of repeated meetings and discussions by personnel from the Japanese Army and Navy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Their opinion is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to have overlooked the importance of Japan's southern expansion, so it should be requested to adopt a more forceful policy on this matter. Japan's gaze has long been focused on the above-mentioned places as outlets for its surplus population. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs, which is responsible for the immigration issue, is naturally the most concerned. However, without the cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the province cannot conduct negotiations with the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. According to Article 3 of the United States Immigration Law of 1917, contract laborers are prohibited from entering the Philippines. In fact, only a small number of Japanese laborers are permitted to enter under the condition that they are only engaged in agriculture and commerce. As for the Dutch East Indies, there is a law on foreigners entering the country, which adopts a quota system for immigrants from various countries. Under this system, Japan immigrates about 800 people to the Dutch East Indies each year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of November 1, 1933, the number of Japanese residents in the Philippines was 20,400, and the number of Japanese residents in the Dutch East Indies was only 6,900.

<p>(Washington) The United States Department of Commerce recently analyzed Philippine business and stated that Japanese residents in the Philippines have seized much of the small-scale business of overseas Chinese, resulting in a large increase in Japanese imports to the Philippines last year. In total, Japanese residents accounted for nearly 35 percent of the total retail sales in the Philippines last year. In 1933, Japanese stores accounted for only 25 percent, while Chinese stores accounted for 40 percent, which is in line with the ratio of 20 percent and 50 percent in 1932. The Japanese have spared no effort in promoting their goods, so Japanese goods accounted for 14.23% of the total imports to the Philippines last year. Most of the increase in Japanese goods was at the expense of American goods, with only a few exceptions. In recent years, the Japanese have been trying to get rid of their reliance on overseas Chinese to run retail businesses, and have set up import branches in various ports in the Philippines and encouraged Japanese residents to set up stores, giving them long-term credit. Japanese stores are mostly clean, and their goods are cheap and of good quality, so they have been very effective. Now there are Japanese stores in various cities and towns, competing with Chinese stores. (27th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) The United States Bureau of Mines published the 1936 Minerals Yearbook, which stated that the antimony industry in 1935 had progressed with the industrial recovery. China still holds the world's lead in antimony production, but Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru have also greatly increased their production, which has greatly increased their production, posing a threat to China's market. Last year, due to strong sales, antimony prices soared. The greatest need was in Europe, which was naturally due to arms manufacturing. In the United States, the demand for antimony also increased due to the increase in automobile production. China's antimony industry is still subject to government control, so as sales have increased, antimony prices have also risen. The antimony produced in the Americas is slightly cheaper. In total, the production of the world's major producing countries last year was 17,700 tons for China, 3,656 tons for Mexico, 2,674 tons for Bolivia, and 343 tons for Peru. In addition, the production of antimony in Africa has also increased in recent years, and the world's antimony ore reserves are still rich, so they will not be exhausted for a while.

The consumption of tea in the United States has not changed much in the past three years, at approximately 84 million pounds, but it has decreased significantly compared to the annual import of approximately 100 million pounds ten years ago. The green tea imported from Japan and China has continued to decrease, while black tea and oolong tea have increased slightly. The total amount of tea exported from China to the United States last year, including red, green, and oolong teas, was 6,128,142 pounds, accounting for only 7.3 percent of the total imports to the United States. Black tea accounted for the most. Tea from Japan and Taiwan accounted for 25.21 percent. Japan mainly exports green tea, Taiwan mainly exports oolong tea, but black tea has also increased.

<p>The Hague. Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Colijn delivered a radio address this morning, stating that after Switzerland adopted a currency devaluation policy, the Dutch government had no choice but to reconsider its traditional monetary policy. It has now ordered a ban on gold exports. In addition, an Exchange Equalisation Fund has been established to stabilize foreign exchange. In the future, the price of imported goods will inevitably rise, but the price of domestic goods will not necessarily increase accordingly. Citizens should not raise prices or hide gold. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>The Hague. Dutch Prime Minister Colijn announced in a radio broadcast in Amsterdam today that the Netherlands would also follow Britain in adopting a managed currency system, and asked the people to remain calm and have confidence in the government. The government is confident that it can work with the Dutch Bank to manage the value of the guilder. According to announcements here, both houses of the Dutch Parliament have convened emergency meetings. Colijn did not mention devaluation in his broadcast speech, but hinted that the value of the guilder might weaken slightly. Colijn also announced the establishment of a 300 million guilder equalisation fund and immediately introduced legislation to prevent rapid price increases. While Colijn did not specify how much the value of the guilder would be devalued in the future, banking circles informally indicated that the value of the guilder might be devalued by about 10%, the extent of which would depend on the progress of prices. The calmness of Colijn's speech gave the financial community a very good impression. Although the stock exchange was closed today, other markets were open as usual, but transactions were limited and only at nominal prices. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>The Hague. Reliable sources say today that the Dutch government has decided to adopt the managed currency system implemented by the United Kingdom after abandoning the gold standard in order to devalue the Dutch guilder by 5 to 20 percent, and to allocate 150 million guilders to establish an equalisation fund to adjust exchange rate fluctuations.

<p>Bern.

<p>(Washington) The government and financial circles are currently discussing the possibility of the United States revising its strict regulations on cash exports to allow gold to circulate more freely among countries participating in international monetary agreements. It is felt that as a result of the establishment of this agreement, the United States' huge amount of gold may flow out slightly. According to current regulations on gold exports, gold can only be shipped to countries that still use the full gold standard, such as France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. If the restoration of monetary balance between various economic systems is successful, it is believed that gold should be allowed to circulate among countries participating in international monetary agreements to facilitate the adjustment of international trade imbalances. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau met with President Roosevelt today, mainly to determine the Treasury Department's policy on gold exports. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Soviet Russia Denies Selling One Million Pounds <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Local newspapers published a statement from the Soviet State Bank, saying that according to a report from the United Press in Washington, US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau made a statement to reporters on the 20th of this month, claiming that an agent of the Soviet State Bank had sold one million pounds of British currency in the financial market without limit, in an attempt to depress the price of the pound. Fortunately, he (Morgenthau) intervened and used American balance funds to purchase the pounds, so as to avoid the results of the Soviet State Bank's methods. The State Bank now declares that Morgenthau's statement, claiming that the Soviet State Bank intended to depress the pound, is completely unfounded slander. The pretext used by Morgenthau for his statement was ordinary banking business conducted by the State Bank through its agent, Chase Bank in New York. On October 1st of this year, the Soviet Union will, before the due date, use Stockholm's Enskilda Bank to redeem a batch of bonds issued in 1931 held by the well-known Swedish manufacturer ACEA, totaling US$6,890,700. The Soviet government had announced this matter in advance in newspapers in the Soviet Union and other countries in June of this year. In order to handle this business, the Soviet State Bank notified its permanent agent in New York, Chase Bank, on September 25th of this year to perform the following two procedures: (1) remit US$6,890,700 to Stockholm's Enskilda Bank; (2) sell one million pounds of British currency at the highest possible price (the State Bank had specifically pointed this out in a telegram to Chase Bank on September 25th), equivalent to US$5 million, to replenish the State Bank's US dollar account at Chase Bank. This is ordinary banking business, but US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau actually used it as a pretext for the Soviet Union to disrupt the world's financial balance and the pound's exchange rate, which is really strange. Therefore, Morgenthau's statement about the Soviet State Bank is obviously unfounded and gives people the impression of a non-noble anti-Soviet slander, the purpose of which is not to protect international monetary balance or the pound's exchange rate, but to serve other purposes. (TASS, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that the Soviet Union sold one million pounds in the New York market yesterday, which was absorbed by the US Treasury Department. According to well-informed sources, the treasury departments of Britain and the United States have secretly agreed on the future value of the pound and the US dollar. Britain advocates suppressing the current value to US$4.70 per pound, while the United States insists that the price should not be lower than US$4.95. It is now believed that both sides will compromise so that the pound price fluctuates between US$4.80 and US$4.90. It is expected that the Soviet Union is deeply afraid that the value of the US dollar converted into pounds will decrease, so it sold the pound at a price of around US$5.00. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">French National Assembly Discusses New Monetary System, Finance Committee Has Passed, Right-Wing Proposal to Postpone Rejected <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The National Assembly began discussing the new monetary bill this morning, and will submit it to the Senate in the evening. Therefore, the Senate is scheduled to meet at 7:00 PM to discuss it. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The temporary meeting of the National Assembly opened at 11:20 AM this morning to discuss the new monetary bill proposed by the government. President of the Assembly Herriot said that today's meeting is of great importance, so the audience seats are full. However, the morning meeting was only a formality, and the important discussion will have to wait until the afternoon. This morning, the first speaker was the Finance Committee reporter (Radical Socialist Party member) Schmidt, who strongly advocated the currency devaluation policy, saying that he himself had long advocated currency devaluation. After the implementation of this policy, the Bank of France would re-evaluate the value of its gold, and would obtain a profit of 16 billion francs. Of this, 10 billion francs should be used for the exchange equalization fund, and the remaining 6 billion francs should be deposited by the government in the Bank of France to repay the government's debts to the bank and increase the bank's activity capacity. This is obviously beneficial, etc. The leader of the right-wing Republican Democratic Union, former Minister without Portfolio Marran, then rose to speak and criticised the bill proposed by the government, saying that the result would put public debt holders and people receiving pensions in a difficult situation, and requested that the discussion of this bill be postponed and returned to the Finance Committee for re-examination. The Chairman put Marran's suggestion to a vote, and as a result, it was rejected by 365 votes to 248. It was 1:00 PM, and the meeting was adjourned until 4:00 PM. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Finance Committee of the National Assembly met this afternoon. Finance Minister Olivar attended and explained the negotiation process of the British, French, and American monetary agreement and the content of the new monetary bill. The Finance Committee immediately voted to pass the monetary bill proposed by the government without making any modifications to the original proposal. When the Finance Committee voted on the bill, there were 20 votes in favour, 12 votes against, and 7 abstentions. The Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party both voted in favour, the Communist Party abstained from voting, and the central and right-wing parties all voted against. As for the temporary meetings of the Senate and the National Assembly, they are scheduled to open at 9:00 AM tomorrow, when the Radical Socialist Party member of the National Assembly Schmidt will present a report to the National Assembly on behalf of the Finance Committee. There are 15 members who plan to give speeches, including former Finance Minister Reynaud. Reynaud has great authority on financial issues, and his speech will be noticed by all parties. In addition, Finance Minister Olivar, Minister of National Economy Spinasse, and Prime Minister Léon Blum will also participate in the debate. It is expected that the debate will continue throughout the day tomorrow, and a vote cannot be held until late at night. Observers unanimously agree that the National Assembly will pass the monetary bill by a large majority, as was the case when the National Assembly passed various government bills in the past. So far, members of both houses have not proposed any amendments, because the full text of the government proposal was only revealed this afternoon, and members have not had time to study it in detail. It is expected that the easiest issues to cause disagreement will be the various economic and social bills associated with the monetary bill, and the bill on revising civil servants' salaries to make them consistent with the price index will be the focus of debate in the National Assembly. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The parliamentary groups of the Communist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Independent Socialist Party held meetings this morning to discuss the position that their respective parliamentary groups should take on the new monetary bill. As a result, they all supported the government's proposal. Among them, the Radical Socialist Party voted in favour by 55 votes to 13. The Communist Party advocated that all amendments aimed at assisting the working class and the middle class, so as not to suffer losses due to currency devaluation, should be supported. From this point of view, the government will definitely get a majority of votes in favour of the new monetary bill in the National Assembly. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e34">New Monetary Law Divided Into Seven Items <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The main points of the new monetary bill submitted by the government to the National Assembly can be divided into the following seven points:</p>
<p>(1) The monetary law of June 25, 1928, stipulates that each franc contains 0.0655 grams of gold with 90% purity, and that the Bank of France has the obligation to accept paper money in exchange for cash. Both of these provisions are repealed.</p>
<p>(2) The gold content of the franc in the future shall be stipulated by order separately, but the weight of gold contained in each new franc shall not be less than 0.043 grams and shall not be more than 0.049 grams. In other words, the original value of the franc will be devalued by at least one-quarter and at most one-third.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of the Exchange Equalisation Fund is to adjust the exchange rate of the franc against foreign currencies, so as not to exceed the restrictions stipulated in the above item.</p>
<p>(4) The Exchange Equalisation Fund is managed by the Bank of France on behalf of the Treasury, which is no different from the current practices in Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>In short, the franc will temporarily suspend cash redemption before the exchange rate is truly stable. As for the measure to stabilize the exchange rate, it may not be certain until several months or a year later. It is expected to stabilize at the same time as the pound and the US dollar.</p>
<p>(5) Recalculate the value of the Bank of France's gold reserves at 0.049 grams of gold with 90% purity per franc, and most of the surplus, that is, 13 billion francs, will be allocated for the Exchange Equalisation Fund.</p>
<p>(6) After the suspension of cash redemption of paper money, the gold market must be controlled, and the responsibility for control is given to the Bank of France.</p>
<p>(7) Those who possess gold bars, gold coins, and gold coins at home and abroad must report the amount of pure gold they possess to the government before October 10th, and the government will extract funds, the amount of which must be equal to the amount by which the price of gold has increased due to the devaluation of the franc.</p>
<p>In addition, the new monetary bill also advocates revising salaries and wages to be compatible with the price index. As for the holders of various public debts and treasury bills, they can exchange their bonds for life bonds and give a subsidy of 10% (that is, a bond with a face value of 100 francs can be exchanged for a life bond of 110 francs). Those who purchased short-term treasury bills between July 10th and September 23rd of this year shall be given considerable benefits for reconciliation. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This bill does not determine the legal gold content of the new franc, but only states that the gold content of the franc shall be stipulated by order in the future, which is not what our telegram expected yesterday. At the same time, the monetary bill stipulates that the minimum gold content of each franc is 0.043 grams of gold with 90% purity, and the maximum is 0.049 grams of gold with 90% purity. The original gold content of the franc was 0.0655 grams of gold with 90% purity, so this decision to devalue the franc, the percentage of its devaluation, is at least 25.19% and at most 34.36%. In other words, after the government's monetary bill is passed by the National Assembly, the franc will fall in price by at least one-quarter. The Bank of France currently has reserves of 520 billion francs. After the monetary devaluation, recalculating the franc can yield a profit of 13 billion francs. Afterwards, the franc can continue to be devalued to the maximum limit of 34.36% under the strict control of the monetary authorities. When the franc continues to be devalued, the currencies of the United States and Belgium shall also be devalued accordingly according to the monetary agreement. The government can use this method to determine the nominal value of French currency, so that it advances and retreats in the same way as the nominal value of American currency. In addition, it can be adjusted by the exchange rate balance fund. If this is the case, it will not be difficult for various currencies to achieve the ultimate goal of mutual stability.

<p>Burgos. Spanish rebel leader General Franco issued a public statement here today, saying that the revolutionary army has now occupied the fortress of Toledo, 50 miles southwest of Madrid, and the remaining garrison in the Alcázar Fortress has been rescued. General Varela's column was the most successful in the rebel occupation of Toledo, as the team broke through the government army's front line in Maguarda, occupied the city of Torrijos, and then crossed the Guadarrama River under heavy fire. The advance guard of the team, led by Colonel Gastilon, first arrived near the Alcázar Fortress at dawn, and then charged forward in order to rescue the brave and unyielding garrison in the fortress. Before the rebels crossed the Guadarrama River, the planes of the two armies had a fierce air battle, because several government planes were ordered to fly from Madrid to Toledo to stop the rebels from advancing. Unexpectedly, they met five rebel bombers and nine fighter planes on the way. The government planes saw that they were outnumbered and tried to escape, but two of them were shot down by the rebel planes. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Toledo Front. General Franco's troops fought fiercely with the government army all day today and have already entered the city of Toledo. As of the time of the telegram, the war had not stopped. The rebel army is mainly composed of Moorish soldiers and Spanish foreign soldiers. They have now occupied the barracks, hospitals, bullfighting arenas, and the entire northern suburbs. The government army is still holding on to the ancient city within the city wall, including the Alcázar Fortress. The rebel army entered through the Visagra Gate and has now made contact with the troops advancing from the Guadarrama River and the Bagus West Road. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Toledo. A special report from our correspondent says that the outposts of the Nationalist Army opened into the city at 1:00 PM yesterday, and a fierce street battle took place with the garrison. Half an hour later, they occupied the central area of the city. The garrison of the Alcázar Palace, seeing the rescue troops entering the city, also broke out of the siege and made contact with them. At that time, the government army was already exhausted due to heavy losses and immediately retreated to the town of West Guadalajara, retreating both on foot and by truck. Except for the area near the Alcázar Palace and the Cathedral, the rest of the city is intact, and even the Cathedral was not affected. At this moment, the avenue from the city to Madrid has been controlled by the Nationalist Army's artillery fire for several kilometers. Another column, led by General Varela, has occupied the town of Lillhof near the city of Torrijos, killing about 100 government soldiers. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Lisbon. Spanish rebel General Trano broadcast a message on the Seville radio station yesterday, saying that Toledo had been captured today and Madrid could be captured tomorrow. However, the Madrid government authorities do not admit that the capital has been shaken. As for the rebel army's offensive plan, it does not go beyond the following two routes: one is to advance 20 miles east from Toledo, occupy Aranjuez, and cut off the railway to cut off Madrid's food supply; the other is to divide the troops into three routes and go straight to Madrid. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Madrid. The Spanish government issued a letter to the people of the whole country today, the main idea being: "The government does not want to hide anything about the facts. It is our duty to inform the people that the enemy has promised our national land to foreign countries in advance, in order to obtain a large supply of foreign weapons. Now, relying on the superiority of these weapons, they are making their best efforts to advance on Madrid, the capital of the Republic. Madrid is now the core of the anti-fascist struggle. The establishment of the Republican system and the heroic battle against the enemy have all come from the leadership of Madrid. For this reason, the fascist flames and the inhuman rebels will not be happy until they destroy Madrid... Now, only by saving the crisis in Madrid with all our strength can we liberate the entire Spanish nation from the oppression of the Fascist Party. All Republican and anti-fascist families, regardless of Catalan, Basque, Galician, Valencian, and Andalusian, all Spaniards with honor and blood should immediately rise up to participate in the defense of Madrid, and should make preparations in advance, so that even in the event of an accident, they can have something to rely on and be fearless. Although the future is full of difficulties, our heroic people are still blocking the rebel army's path, preventing them from attacking the capital. However, in order to make our efforts more effective, various anti-enemy troops must adjust their actions, abide by military discipline, and obey their leaders before they can be effective," and so on.

<p>(Tianjin) Li Tong, Deputy Director of the Inspection General Office of the Ministry of Finance, is coming to North China and will arrive in Tianjin on the 28th night. He will work with Li Qingxuan and Bailicha in Tianjin to coordinate with the Hebei-Chahar authorities regarding the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office and Customs anti-smuggling matters, and preside over the deployment of anti-smuggling efforts in the suburbs of Tianjin. The authority of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office is still defined as only inspecting military supplies. A separate committee will be established to handle the registration and supplementary taxation of private goods. The regulations will need to wait for Li Qingxuan to return to Beijing to report, be discussed and determined by the ministry, and then be brought back to the north in the short term for public implementation. According to Li Qingxuan, the measures for clearing private goods in Hebei-Chahar will be implemented under the principle of not undermining the integrity of tariffs. There are no longer any problems with this principle. The only issue that remains to be resolved is the supplementary tax rate, which is still in doubt. However, the intention of the Ministry of Finance is still to strive to bring it up to the equilibrium number of customs duties. I have already telegraphed the ministry about the results of the discussions in Tianjin, and will return to Beijing to report in the next day or two, and then return to Tianjin to begin clearing private goods according to the approved measures of the Ministry of Finance. However, the content of the measures is not yet the time to be made public. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

The relocation of the Land Transportation Inspection General Office to Tianjin is under consideration, but has not yet been decided. There is less and less private goods in Anhui, Jiangsu, and southern Shandong. Li Qingxuan has already discussed measures for the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office in Tianjin, and they will be implemented after being reported to Beijing for approval. Mei Weiliang will come to Tianjin on the 15th of next month to take over. He is a capable person in the customs field, and there will be strict anti-smuggling measures when he takes office. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance is reviewing the measures for clearing private goods in Hebei-Chahar based on Li Qingxuan's telegram, and a decision will be made soon.

<p>(Nanjing) The Municipal Government declared that Zhong Dihuan, a recruited accountant of the Da Xiaohuangzhou Tenant Rent Bureau, which is under its jurisdiction, was in charge of accounting and did not receive funds. He asked for leave to return to Guangdong to serve in the Construction Department, and he did not abscond with funds. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai reported on the 28th that Zhong Dihuan, a food accountant of the Da Xiaohuangzhou Local Management Office under the jurisdiction of the Beijing Municipal Government, had absconded with 5,000 yuan. According to the person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Government, the above-mentioned situation is completely inaccurate. Zhong is a Cantonese and specializes in accounting and registration. Guo Xianze is responsible for collecting funds. Moreover, it is still in the land survey period, and rent collection will not begin until next month. How can there be a large sum of money to abscond with? Zhong formally requested leave to return to Guangdong a few days ago because of his low position and low salary, intending to seek a job with Liu Weizhi, Director of the Construction Department. There was no secret absconding with funds. (Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Rural Life Talks: The Economic Life of the Yao People of Dateng Mountain in Guangxi: Forms of Mountain Rent and Extra Contributions <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qingtang, Written by Tang Zhaomin</p>
<p>Whenever I enter the villages of the Yao people, some mountain laborers inevitably complain to me. When it comes to the ferocious mountain landlords, they always shake their heads and sigh. Originally, in Yao Mountain society, mountain landlords are like feudal lords, and mountain laborers are like serfs. Feudal lords have land, so political privileges are completely in their hands; mountain laborers entrust their lives to the land of the mountain landlords, so how can they not be controlled and exploited by them? Just looking at the forms of mountain rent, there are some shocking things: Some pay rent in products, with the income from the mountains accounting for one-third of the output; some pay rent in poultry, with each house site or tomb site, or a section of fishing or hunting ground, required to pay two catties of live chickens each year; some pay rent in currency, generally requiring the equivalent of one-fifth to one-third of the output. In addition, there is also the "labor compensation system" of using labor to pay mountain rent; or when the mountain landlord is too far away from the mountain land and it is difficult for the mountain laborers to send the products to the door, there is also "rent conversion" of converting the rent into currency; there is also a method of calculating rent based on population, that is, the mountain laborers who cultivate the mountain fields, regardless of the size of the land they cultivate (in fact, there are natural restrictions), and the abundance or scarcity of the harvest, all men aged between fifteen and sixty must pay eight jiao of rent silver per person; in some places, the rent is calculated by household, with each household required to pay one yuan—this kind of mountain rent form similar to "poll tax" or "household tax" is only practiced in Huangqian, Liumiao, Hongtai, Luoxi, which belong to Xiang County, and Dongwen, which belongs to Wuyi County. These things are really too bizarre. The mountain laborers are bound by the mountain landlords' chains of layered exploitation, and there is no way to struggle to break free. They only cry as they speak, and we can only sigh as we listen.</p>
<p>As for the general forms of mountain rent: Among the rent in kind, there are two types: share rent and fixed rent. Generally speaking, share rent is more prevalent than fixed rent; the reason is that mountain field reclamation cannot be fertilized as a rule, and due to the relationship of land fertility, the yield in the first year and the second year differs greatly. Therefore, it is not easy to determine the fixed rent. Methods of renting land: Some are agreed upon verbally, and some have written contracts; some do not specify the term of the lease, and some specify a certain period. There is also a "forever long lease" of perpetual tenancy. Generally, the most common is not specifying a term, and the least common is the forever long lease. Those that do not specify a term are often agreed upon verbally; those with a term and perpetual tenancy are mostly written contracts. However, nine out of ten of these contracts are written by Han Chinese on their behalf. Han Chinese can get a "benefit" for writing contracts for them! A writing fee.</p>
<p>In some places, there are also names such as "first installment rent" and "flowing rent." The so-called first installment is to pay a large sum of money to the mountain landlord before renting the mountain land, and then stipulate the amount of rent and set a time limit. Some only pay the first installment once, and no longer pay it afterward; some, in addition to paying the first installment, have to pay a small amount of rent each year—this rent that is paid separately each year is called "flowing rent," or, in contrast to the first installment, it is specifically called the "final installment." The former has the meaning of a pledge, while the latter has a stronger tenancy nature. Although this form of mountain rent with the payment of a first installment can slightly improve the status of the mountain laborers, the mountain laborers pay a large sum of money before they can make a profit, which is very uneconomical.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly asked mountain laborers, which of the various mountain rents is the most suitable? The answer obtained to this question can be summarized in one sentence: it is convenient for the mountain landlords, and the mountain laborers suffer losses. In other words, no matter what form of mountain rent it is, it makes it difficult for the mountain laborers to bear. In fact, the exploitation of the mountain landlords is not only limited to these various mountain rents. In reality, in addition to paying the above-mentioned various mountain rents as usual, the mountain laborers also have various extra supplies to the mountain landlords. Below, let's record the words of Zhao Ruxiang, the head of the Yao people in Guicun, Hongtai Ridge, complaining to me:</p>
<p>"The Yao people, who have become mountain laborers of the Changmao Yao, will never have a bright future in their lives! They are exhausted to death, and they are poor to death! They plant fields, and we plant mountains; every time it comes to the time of demarcation, they want us to help them with their work. We are planting their mountains, who dares not to go? We have to leave our own work undone and help them with their work. By the time we have finished their work, our own farming has passed its season... This is fine, but what is most hateful is that when the mountain landlord comes to our house, he starts calling "boy" and ends calling "boy". We have to treat him with good wine and good food, letting him eat and drink as much as he wants. Eating is not enough, if he sees something that pleases him, he asks for it as soon as he opens his mouth, and takes it as soon as he reaches out his hand. Whether it's chickens, ducks, small dishes, or miscellaneous grains, he has to take some back with him before he can be satisfied. Also, when approving the mountain, they want us to prepare "mountain opening wine"; when sending rent, we also have to bring some wine, rice, and pork to show respect to him. What's even more outrageous is that in some places where cedar and paulownia can be planted, the mountain landlord wants us to "plant trees to return the mountain" (Note 1)!"</p>
<p>My temperament is somewhat impatient, and when I heard him say that it was too pitiful, I interjected, "It's enough for the mountain landlord to want rent, why do they do this kind of nonsense? This is really unreasonable, you can refuse him!" Who knew that before I finished speaking, he shook his head and said, "Sir, you don't know how evil they are! If you don't give it to him, he will scold you if he doesn't beat you. Sometimes, being beaten and scolded is not a big deal, you still have to be fined! Mountain laborers who are not respectful to mountain landlords are violating the "stone tablet" (Note 2). If you don't comply, he will immediately take back the mountain field and tell you to get out."</p>
<p>...We were all silent for a while, and he continued, "Sir, are you angry when you hear these things? You don't know that in some places—for example, in the Liudu Liuding area of Xiuren—mountain laborers even have to pay ten catties, eight catties, or even hundreds of catties of pork to the mountain landlord when they marry a wife!"</p>
<p>When Xiang said this, he almost burst into tears. In fact, not only did he tell me this, but all mountain laborers said the same thing in unison. I thought of the relations of production under the feudal system, and I thought of the extra-economic oppression that landlords often exerted on serfs, so I had to shut up and remain silent.</p>
<p>Note 1: The mountain landlord approves a piece of land to a mountain laborer. The first year is for clearing and planting. In the spring of the second year, the mountain landlord wants the mountain laborer to insert cedar branches on the ground for him to propagate. Some are also planted by the mountain landlord himself, or he sows paulownia seeds himself. But whether the mountain landlord plants them himself or the mountain laborer helps him plant them, the responsibility for protecting them is entirely borne by the mountain laborer. If one of them dies, the mountain laborer must replant it. If a slightly larger tree is hoeed to death, he will also be fined a few cents. After four or five years, the trees will become a forest. This land can no longer be planted and must be returned to the mountain landlord. The mountain laborer cannot share any of the benefits of the trees.</p>
<p>Note 2: There is a primitive political organization in Yao Mountain called the Stone Tablet, that is, a village or several villages, or even dozens of villages, unite and erect a stone in an open space. They sacrifice a pig as a sacrifice to it. After the sacrifice, each drinks a cup of blood wine to show solidarity. The head of the Stone Tablet (i.e., the leader) will announce the rules in public, and everyone must abide by them afterward. The mountain laborer class sometimes participates in various matters, but has no right to speak. They only carefully abide by what the mountain landlords have agreed upon.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Implementing Joint Water-Land Transportation for Traveler Convenience <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: The Ministries of Communications and Railways have made considerable achievements in developing transportation in recent years. The completion of the Yuehan Railway this time has broken the isolated situation of the two Guangdong provinces at once, and its contribution is especially noteworthy. In order to complete the joint water-land transportation, it is striving to connect the Pinghan, Yuehan, Tianjin-Pukou, and Shanghai-Nanjing lines. The Pinghan, Yuehan, Tianjin-Pukou, and Shanghai-Nanjing lines also take Hankou and Nanjing as hubs. The Jinghan route is connected by the Yangtze River. In terms of ship transportation, there should be special equipment and speed to cope with the environment. At present, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River ships, such as the Jiang'an, Jiangshun, Jianghua, and Jiangxin, although their equipment and speed are better than other ships, are still difficult to shoulder this important task. The Ministries of Communications and Railways have proposed to build a new Jinghan express ship. The plan has been drafted and is expected to be implemented. A brief outline is recorded below, which is also a noteworthy page in the history of transportation.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding Design: The length of the ships currently sailing on the Yangtze River is 340 feet at most. The length of the express ship is set at 300 feet, so that when the Yangtze River is low, there will be no difficulties in sailing. The total capacity is roughly limited to 3,000 tons. The cargo is from 300 tons to 400 tons. In addition to the rooms used by the crew, the passenger cabins should be able to accommodate at least the following number of passengers: 20 in the special class, 40 in the first class, 200 in the second class, and 600 in the ordinary class. As for the speed, the minimum speed upstream is 12 nautical miles, and the downstream speed is 16.5 nautical miles. The draft depth should not exceed 11 feet when fully loaded, so that it can sail in winter.</p>
<p>Shipping Line and Schedule: The Jinghan express ship will run exclusively between Nanjing and Hankou, passing through Jiujiang, Anqing, etc., each stopping for half an hour to allow passengers to board and disembark. The schedule stipulates that it will depart from Nanjing on Mondays and Thursdays, and from Hankou on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The ship will stay in Beijing for one day of the week. It is found that Nanjing to Anqing is 158 nautical miles, Anqing to Jiujiang is 90 nautical miles, and Jiujiang to Hankou is 139 nautical miles. If the express ship's upstream speed is 12 nautical miles, then Nanjing to Anqing will take 13 hours and 10 minutes, Anqing to Jiujiang will take 7.5 hours, and Jiujiang to Hankou will take 11.5 hours. It is estimated that it will take 32 hours and 10 minutes to travel from Nanjing to Hankou. Assuming that the berthing time in Anqing and Jiujiang is 1 hour and 45 minutes, then it will take 34 hours for the express ship to go upstream from Nanjing to Hankou. If the downstream speed is set at 16.5 nautical miles, then it will take 8.5 hours from Hankou to Jiujiang. The travel time from Hankou to Nanjing is 24 hours. Assuming that the berthing in Jiujiang and Anqing is 1 hour, it will take 25 hours to go downstream from Hankou to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Budget Estimate: Regarding the expenditure, one is the start-up fee, the shipbuilding material cost is estimated at 900,000 yuan, and the ship's passenger equipment is estimated at 100,000 yuan, for a total of 1 million yuan. The other is the operating cost: (1) The salary and food of the driving engine workers is estimated at 3,700 yuan per month, totaling 44,400 yuan per year. (2) The food of the employees of the administrative department is 2,500 yuan, totaling 30,000 yuan per year. (3) The repair cost is 16,000 yuan per year. (4) The interest on the ship's capital is about 50,000 yuan per year, calculated at 5%. (5) The depreciation of the ship's capital is 5%, which is 50,000 yuan. (6) The insurance is 3%, which is 30,000 yuan. (7) Gold sundries are 1,200 yuan per month, totaling 14,400 yuan per year. (8) Coal, the weekly budget is 320 tons, estimated at 4,000 yuan. Excluding the repair period, it is calculated at 48 weeks per year, which requires 192,000 yuan. (9) Tonnage tax, loading and unloading fees for passengers and cargo, and miscellaneous items, totaling 10,000 yuan per year. The total annual operating expenses are estimated at 436,800 yuan. Regarding income, A. 20 special class passengers, 36 yuan per person, totaling 720 yuan. B. 40 first-class passengers, 16 yuan per person, totaling 640 yuan. C. 200 second-class passengers, 10 yuan per person, totaling 2,000 yuan. D. 600 ordinary-class passengers, 4 yuan per person, totaling 2,400 yuan. The above totals 5,760 yuan. Calculated at 50%, the passenger revenue per trip is 2,380 yuan. Also, due to short-distance passengers, etc., the net amount is calculated at 85% of the above number, which is 2,023 yuan. There are four round trips per week, totaling 8,092 yuan. Calculated at 48 weeks per year, the total is 388,416 yuan. In addition, the freight for goods and mail is estimated at 500 yuan per week, totaling 24,000 yuan per year. Therefore, the total annual revenue from passenger tickets and freight is 410,416 yuan. The above expenditure totals 436,800 yuan, and the revenue totals 410,416 yuan. It is estimated that there will be a loss of 26,384 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Cooperation Method: The cost of shipbuilding is estimated at 1 million yuan per ship. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications will each build one ship first, that is, use the remaining amount of the materials ordered for the new ship built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in the Gengzi Indemnity Loan the year before last. The wage portion will be raised by the Ministry separately. However, according to the distribution of shipping money, three ships are required to have one ship departing from Beijing and Hankou every day. However, two ships will be piloted first. The third ship is planned to be built after the negotiation with a German merchant to borrow materials. The joint transportation method of this express ship will be determined by the Ministry of Communications in consultation with the Ministry of Railways with reference to the successful cases of water-land joint transportation in various places. The main purpose of setting up the express ship is to connect with the Pinghan, Yuehan, Tianjin-Pukou, and Shanghai-Nanjing railways. The schedules of all railways and express ships should be discussed with the relevant railway bureaus for a long-term plan to achieve perfection and benefit travelers. However, the expenses of the express ship are very large, especially the item of coal. Since the Ministry of Communications is cooperating with the Ministry of Railways, the freight for coal, regardless of where it is purchased, will be calculated at half the rate for all railway transportation in accordance with regulations, in order to maintain career transportation.

<h3 id="e66">Cancellation of the Fujian Tax Inspection Office Great Success of Smuggling Suppression in Four Months Fujian and Xiamen Have Been Severely Attacked by a Certain Party <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The Fujian Provincial Government established the Provincial Tax Inspection Office in May and set up 18 inspection branch offices in important coastal ports to cooperate with the customs patrol ships in suppressing smuggling by land and water. After four months, the effect has just begun to show. On September 19, the provincial government suddenly ordered all of them to be revoked. Fujian Province and Taiwan are separated by a strip of water. From Changle and Lianjiang in the north to Xiamen and Zhangpu in the south, they face each other across the sea. The narrowest point is only 70 nautical miles, and can be navigated by a small boat. Therefore, smuggled goods are loaded from Taiwan by sailboats or paddle boats and driven directly to the coastal ports for unloading. The second half of last year was the most prosperous. Almost all the white sugar was smuggled. In January, the Xiamen Customs officially reported that only a few hundred catties were imported for tax purposes. In addition, kerosene, cloth, seafood, matches, and groceries were also major items. From July last year to April this year, it is estimated that the total value of smuggled goods imported into the jurisdiction of Xiamen Customs in ten months was no less than 5 million yuan. Last winter, Xiamen Customs submitted a report to the General Taxation Department to increase the number of patrol ships to patrol the coast in sections. Many cases were detected. The confiscated goods were auctioned in Shanghai, and the ships were dismantled, which suffered considerable blows. However, the customs can only reach the sea. Most of the smuggling is done by coastal merchants colluding with local bullies. If they can break through the patrol ship's logical seizure of money, they can travel unimpeded. Moreover, smugglers also privately set up radio stations to communicate with each other and peep at the actions of patrol ships, waiting for the opportunity to cross quickly, so they have not been slightly suppressed. The establishment of the provincial government's inspection office is specifically responsible for land smuggling suppression, which complements the customs. The joint investigation by land and water has been effective for four months. In August, Xiamen Customs' import tax reached more than 930,000 yuan, breaking this year's record, which can be a clear proof. However, this also aroused repercussions, starting in Fuzhou and then in Xiamen. Last month, the inspection office conducted an inspection of smuggled goods in shops in Fuzhou City, which greatly opposed a certain party. In order to cope with the environment, the provincial government recently ordered the inspection office to revoke the Changle, Hui'an, and Shima branch offices. Xia Sheng, the director of the inspection office, immediately submitted a report to the provincial government on the 19th, requesting the complete revocation of the inspection office and its branch offices, which was approved by the provincial government and notified all branch offices in the province to end on September 25. The order stated, "According to the report submitted by Xia Sheng, the director of the Provincial Tax Inspection Office, the office has financial difficulties, and smuggling has gradually subsided recently. There is no need to establish the office. Please revoke it to emphasize public funds." It has been found that this is true and should be approved for revocation. In addition to ordering the office and all tax bureaus to know and handle it, it is ordered to transfer the order to all branch offices for compliance. The Xiamen Office was established for only 19 days, and the work was stopped upon receiving the order, and it ended at the same time on the 25th. The office cracked a case on the 15th night where sailors of the Yixian warship smuggled sugar. The Quanzhou 12th branch office, together with the Quanzhou sub-customs, cracked a smuggling agency in Xunpu outside the city on the 13th, which are the most notable events in southern Fujian recently.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Anhui North Tobacco Leaf Bumper Harvest Now on the Market Concentrated in Mentai <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Communication: The Fengyang and Dingyuan in northern Anhui. The Huaiyuan area has fertile soil and abundant products. In addition to the five grains, tobacco leaves are the most important. The production in Fengjing is the largest. It is the only by-product of farmers. Every autumn, when tobacco leaves come on the market, the famous major tobacco companies send personnel to set up warehouses to purchase and transport them. Used as raw materials for cigarette making, and the British Yizhong Tobacco Company (formerly known as the British-American Tobacco Company) also has a large-scale smoking factory in Mentai Zi, which purchases them every autumn. The income of tobacco farmers is several million yuan, which is used to adjust the rural economy. The Tobacco Tax Management Office receives the most smoking tax every year, up to more than 600,000 yuan. This year, the weather is good, and the tobacco leaves have a bumper harvest. They have now come on the market one after another. Here is a brief record of the production and sales of tobacco areas.</p>
<p>Production Area: The original soil tobacco in Fengyang was promoted by the compradors of the British-American Tobacco Company during the 89th year of the Republic of China, and American tobacco leaves were planted and improved. Tobacco farmers made huge profits. By the 12th and 13th years of the Republic of China, more and more people planted them, and the price also increased. The average value of each hundred pounds was 20 yuan. At that time, the tobacco companies that purchased tobacco leaves included British-American, Nanyang, Flag, and Huacheng tobacco companies. Later, the value gradually decreased, and Nanyang. Huacheng stopped buying one after another. Now the market is almost completely monopolized by Yizhong. Because of the strong foreign capital, no Chinese tobacco company can compete with it. Fengyang is the most common production area, followed by Dingyuan. Huaiyuan is second. In addition, there are also planters in counties such as Shou County. Su County. Lingbi. Wuhe, etc., but the number is small. According to statistics, there are more than 40,000 tobacco farmers in several counties.</p>
<p>Sowing: Most of the tobacco leaves in the counties are American varieties, and the soil varieties have been gradually eliminated. The sowing time is in March in spring. The seeds are scattered in specially opened garden ridges. Before the Minor Fullness, the tobacco seedlings have grown four or five inches long. At this time, they are transplanted into the fields, just like transplanting rice seedlings. Tobacco fields must be given considerable fertilizer to facilitate growth. The work of cultivating, weeding, and removing insects is also very繁劇。 Tobacco leaves are warm and should be mild. They are afraid of drought and especially afraid of waterlogging.</p>
<p>Harvest: By mid-July, the leaves gradually grow up. The tobacco farmers gradually pick them from the bottom to the top of the stems and place them in the pit room to bake them. The large pit room can bake 500 catties each time, and the small one can bake 300 catties each time. Each time, it takes four or five days to dry. At this time, they are transported out of the pit room and placed on the ground to be slightly exposed to dew to make them soft. Then they are collected indoors and selected manually, divided into grades, and transported to the market for sale.</p>
<p>Yield: The maximum yield of tobacco leaves per mu can reach more than 35 market catties. The larger the yield, the better the quality. Otherwise, the quality of tobacco is inferior. The income from selling tobacco per mu is more than 100 yuan, and less than only a few yuan. As for the cost, each mu requires 45 yuan of fertilizer, and the coal for baking accounts for 2 yuan. In total, the average cost of planting and harvesting per mu is more than 10 yuan. Therefore, tobacco farmers sometimes lose money. After the tobacco leaves come on the market, they are tied into bundles by tobacco farmers and transported to the market. Bengbu has a tobacco leaf market. Tobacco companies such as Fuchang and Dalai mostly purchase in Bengbu. The market opens in September every year. This question is because no one has purchased it recently, so it has not been weighed yet. However, Mentai Zi has Yizhong Tobacco Company setting up a factory to purchase, and it has now been weighed. A large number of tobacco leaves from all directions are transported and concentrated in Mentai every day. Shouldering burdens, carrying donkeys, and boxes are endless, and the market is suddenly lively. Social finance is also suddenly active. The recent tobacco market seems to be between 6 yuan and 40 yuan per dan. Because the quality of tobacco is good or bad, the price is very different. The Bengbu Tobacco Tax Management Office's Mentai smoking tax collection office collects taxes at the factory, and the daily income is considerable.</p>
<p>Wu Manufacturing: When Yizhong Tobacco Company in Mentai Zi purchases tobacco leaves, it purchases them on one side and re-smokes them on the other side. There are smoking machines in the factory, and a large number of workers are hired to smoke them in the factory every day. They are divided into grades and packed in specially made large wooden barrels, which can prevent corrosion and remain unchanged for a long time. Stacks are stacked like mountains in the warehouse. As soon as next year's spring comes, they will be loaded into cars and transported to Shanghai to make cigarettes and distributed to various places at home and abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Songjiang Please Exempt Housing Donations <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The county investigated the housing donations, and the county chamber of commerce previously telegraphed the provincial government, cherishing the people's livelihood, and requested that it be exempted. Now, Zhou Xuewen, the chairman of the Red Branch Association of this county, also telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the provincial government on this day, stating that the business shop house donation in this county has been levied for many years, and recently there is an order to increase the household house donation. Now the police are being sent to investigate door-to-door, and the donation rate is levied according to the proportion of rent. If it is self-produced, the price will be estimated to pay the empty donation. The business shop is a business place and has already paid the donation, and the merchants and people's residences have other residences. One donation is levied again, which is extremely harsh and cumbersome. I have checked that the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes is a clear order from your court and should be followed. However, when the people are celebrating the recovery and the local vitality has not recovered, the provincial order for the new donation is suddenly promulgated. Is it not that the central and local government orders are divergent and the people's livelihood is declining, and the scars are all over the place, which is the current fact? Our association has been running around to provide relief for many years, deeply involved in the people, and has seen and heard the truth. When the police are sent to investigate, they all sigh that the increase in donations is not far away, and they are all worried and hesitant. The situation is suspicious and frightened, and the suffering of the people cannot be concealed from the top. In addition to telegraphing separately, a special telegraph is used to appeal. I beg you to maintain the foundation of the country, consider the difficulties of the people, and quickly abolish the household donation to comfort the hope. The telegram cannot win the urgent order.</p>

<h3 id="e80">British Correspondence Establishment of the Anglo-Egyptian Military Alliance Treaty <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Lieshan</p>
<p>Judging from the contents of this treaty, the Egyptian independence movement, which has been fought for over the years, has largely been successful. The only thing the British have not relaxed their grip on is the military power in the Suez Canal area. The rest, to a greater or lesser extent, can be considered a major concession. Egypt is establishing this treaty with Britain as an independent country. From now on, it will be a country completely equal to Britain. According to the treaty, both sides will send ambassadors to each other. Britain will help Egypt apply to join the League of Nations and obtain membership. At the same time, Britain has also agreed to abolish extraterritorial rights in Egypt and withdraw troops to within the Suez Canal area. In short, the British feel that this time they are truly a nation that could not be any greater!</p>
<p>The most important points of the treaty are as follows:</p>
<p>Suez Canal Garrison Issue British troops will soon begin to move from the Egyptian interior to the Suez Canal area. Egypt recognizes Britain's right to protect the Suez Canal. The number of British troops is stipulated at 10,000, plus airmen and crew, for a term of 20 years. If circumstances change after 20 years and Egypt wants to reclaim its power, this dispute will be decided by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>However, the British withdrawal of troops from the Egyptian interior is not unconditional. The Egyptian government must build four 20-foot-wide military roads between the Egyptian interior and the Suez Canal area, and three railway lines must be renovated or have their gauge changed. In addition, barracks must be built for the British garrison in the Suez Canal area. Only after Egypt fully fulfills these conditions will Britain begin to withdraw its troops. Because after all these transportation issues are resolved, these 10,000 British troops will still have great military significance in Egypt. In addition, British aircraft can freely fly over Egyptian territory in peacetime, and British troops can be stationed everywhere in wartime, with the Egyptian government having no right to interfere. It can be seen that the British are unwilling to concede much in military matters.</p>
<p>Several Egyptian Victories The Egyptian army, which has historically been under British control, will be completely reorganized. British officers serving in the army will all resign and be replaced by Egyptians. However, Britain will send a military advisory group to help the Egyptian government train the new army. From now on, Egypt will officially have its own national defense forces. However, military equipment is limited to being purchased within the British Empire. Secondly, not only judicial power, but also administrative power, will be fully recovered. The Europeans in the Egyptian government's Ministry of Interior, which were originally a disguised form of extraterritoriality, will be abolished, and the British serving in the Egyptian police will also be given a time limit to retire. The consultant system in public institutions will be abolished. As for the existing consultants, whether they leave or stay after the expiration of their contracts will be at the discretion of the Egyptian government. All this proves that Egypt has in fact gained independence, and not just in name. Because the Egyptians already have full power to manage their own affairs.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one point that shows that the British are indeed showing sincerity in resolving the Egyptian issue this time, hoping to win over the hearts of the Egyptians in preparation for future disasters. Negotiations between Britain and Egypt have been fruitless for years, mostly because the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan issue has been an obstacle. This time, the British have made almost complete concessions on the Sudan issue. The relationship between Sudan and Egypt will return to the situation in 1924. Egyptian troops will soon enter Sudanese territory. The status of Egyptians in Sudan will also be equal to that of the British. This can probably satisfy the Egyptians, at least in the eyes of the British. The British have built a defense line on the Suez Canal, and there is no domestic worry for at least a decade or two. On the other hand, especially in the past year, various countries have joined the arms race. Britain is not only a heavy industry country, but also has special advantages over others. Although Britain is constantly declaring in parliament and newspapers that its military strength is insufficient, this argument has gradually aroused suspicion. Recently, German newspapers have even pointed out that Britain's gradual increase in military strength is one of the reasons for the current European unrest. It can be seen that Britain has reached a considerable level of preparation.</p>
<p>The British Empire may collapse in a future war, but whoever strikes her first will not necessarily gain any advantage. (September 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e82">Li Shun Steamer Encountered Danger En Route Fortunately Escaped Danger by Using Oil Power <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Li Shun, a steamer owned by Li Shun Shipping Company, with a load capacity of 3,187 tons and a cargo capacity of 4,640 tons, is currently in Osaka, Japan, loading cargo for Dalian Bay. Yesterday, this city received a telegram from its shipowner stating that the Li Shun encountered a large storm while en route from Osaka. The ship was having great difficulty navigating. The ship was tossing violently in the storm. The axle hook, Conplinp boltunt, suddenly broke, making the ship even more dangerous. At that time, the shipowner's rescue plan was to pour a lot of Mobile ai, which was loaded on the deck, into the sea in order to flatten the huge waves on the sea surface. The oil power can suppress the waves in the sea, so that the ship's surroundings will not be subjected to the impact of the tossing again. At the same time, the shipowner urgently repaired the axle hook and managed to sail on. As for the damage to the ship's body, it will be inspected and reported in detail after unloading the cargo in Dalian.</p>

Including the number of donations from various groups, it totals more than 400,000 yuan. It is expected to receive 600,000 yuan by the end of the month. It is hoped that colleagues will find ways to work hard, regardless of whether the organizations and individuals that have pledged to donate but have not yet paid, or those that have not pledged to donate and have paid, must complete it in a short period of time and achieve the original goal of 1 million yuan. Then, after the field staff reported the situation of the contact, many routine cases were discussed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e87">What I Saw Yesterday The Situation in the Hongkou and Zhabei Areas Japanese Soldiers Are Withdrawing and Stationing in Succession Old Buildings and Factories Are Patrolling Separately <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the situation in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas was still stable yesterday. At the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road in the Public Concession, the place where the Japanese sailors were attacked on the 23rd of this month, five or six Japanese military vehicles loaded with armed soldiers patrolled yesterday morning around 10:00 AM. An armored vehicle was parked in front of the Japanese military detachment of the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road. One or two Japanese soldiers were still stationed at each important intersection. The Japanese elementary school resumed classes as usual yesterday morning. Several Japanese soldiers were stationed in front of the school gate. There were no Japanese soldiers in the Bazibang area of Zhabei. Even the five Japanese soldiers stationed at the Japanese cemetery returned to the camp yesterday morning. The situation of the Japanese soldiers stationed in the Japanese brewery behind the 63 Flower Garden was the same as yesterday. The reporter went to watch at a distance of about a dozen steps from the factory yesterday morning, which proves that the rumors that the Japanese army was building projects next to the factory are not accurate. There were about dozens of Japanese soldiers stationed in the factory. A shed made of corrugated iron was set up next to the factory for vehicles to park. The land of the factory is mostly owned by the Japanese. This time, because the Japanese army's housing was not enough, dozens of them were temporarily moved here and will be moved out soon. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency discovered dozens of Japanese soldiers stationed at the intersections of Diswei Road and Qimei Road, and Ouyang Road and Sida Road yesterday. According to the investigation results, the Japanese soldiers at the intersection of Diswei Road and Qimei Road are stationed in a foreign house at No. 1097, with about 60 to 70 people. They were moved here from the intersection of Tiantong Road and Diswei Road. At the former site of the Yuenae Garden in the same place, the Japanese army is building on a large scale. It is learned that the construction plan was before the Japanese soldier case on Wusong Road, but construction started from the day before yesterday. It is a military officer's dormitory. As for the Japanese soldiers at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Sida Road, they are stationed in a Japanese girls' school, with about 80 people. These two places are similar to the Yongfeng Building at Xingjiaqiao on North Sichuan Road, belonging to the nature of a detachment. There are also armored vehicles, motorcycles, and military trucks stationed there, which patrol Diswei Road and Qimei Road from time to time. Gather at the wasteland of the old Baoshan Glass Factory at the end of Huayuan Street and the Japanese brewery. The number of Japanese soldiers is indeed close to 200.</p>
<p>At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency also saw a small team of Japanese soldiers, about a dozen people, taking a No. 9 truck and driving straight south across the Sichuan Road Bridge, passing Nanjing Road and heading west, seemingly heading to the west of Shanghai. The Yongfeng Building has been leased by the Japanese army as a detachment. Yesterday, there were still two trucks, one armored vehicle, and one motorcycle parked in front of the building, and five or six guards were stationed on the sidewalk in front of the building.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the abolished Autumn Festival. Banks and money shops in the city are scheduled to close for one day as usual. Industrial and commercial receipts and deliveries have been busier these days. It is heard that the total amount of receipts and deliveries this time is only about 10 million yuan, mostly for downstream companies to repay upstream debts. Because small industrial and commercial businesses in the city have struggled for three months and have shown slight signs of recovery, more than half of them have already been repaid. If the receipts for this festival's accounts are considerable, there will be no delay in the long-term decision before the end of October. Also, silver and money shops are particularly cautious about lending to new customers. Long-term credit loans for industrial and commercial businesses are mostly given accommodation to extend the repayment period. First settle the interest. The market finance has become more stable due to the increase in chips and the loosening of funds. The ups and downs of foreign exchange are generally stable. We are optimistic about the difficult future.</p>

<p>Paper Presentations</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the meeting continued in the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA, with the presentation of members' papers. Tang Qingzeng represented and Li Zhaohuan presided over the meeting, saying, "The scope of the members' papers this time, in view of the nation's difficulties and the people's hardship, and to adapt to the current situation, the topics of the papers all focus on the two major principles of 'Economic Problems in Extraordinary Times' and 'Fiscal Problems in Extraordinary Times,' which is extremely important. A total of fifteen papers have been received this time, all of which are carefully structured. However, the members' ideas are not completely the same, so the agenda of the conference has specially set a longer time for the presentation of papers, in order to learn from each other, get accurate conclusions, and contribute to the government to cope with extraordinary times." The chairman announced the rules for the presentation of papers: 20 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes for discussion, in order. Member Yao Tiexin first presented "On War Economics," followed by Li Quanshi's "The Problem of Implementing Income Tax in China," Zhang Sumin's "Peace Economy and Extraordinary Times Economy," and Xiong Lingxiao's "Finance in Extraordinary Times." After each member's paper presentation, they provided as many opinions as possible, learning from each other and attacking. Especially on the upcoming implementation of the income tax issue, many refined opinions were expressed. The remaining papers will continue to be presented this morning.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Papers</p>
<p>(1) Ma Yinchu on the issue of commodity prices and paper currency policies in extraordinary times: First, he described the commodity price system in extraordinary times, and that China cannot adopt the methods of Europe and the United States in the economic center of the European War and the control of commodity prices. The final conclusion is that in extraordinary times, all necessities for life and military use should adopt a quantitative distribution method. In terms of finance, it is absolutely necessary not to adopt a paper currency policy to promote the soaring of commodity prices. New taxes should be raised, such as income tax and inheritance tax that do not increase the burden on farmers, to supplement. (2) Li Quanshi on the problem of implementing income tax in China, expressed great approval of the principles of income tax, but worried that the good tax of foreign countries that extracts the income of the rich (Soak the Rich) would become an evil tax that extracts the blood of the poor (Soak the Poor) in China. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will start income tax at present to plant the foundation of wartime finance, but should still be treated as normal. The content should not be too harsh. (3) Chen Xing on economic problems in extraordinary times, conducted research on the preparation of manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and believed that the perseverance and outstanding spirit of the revival of Russia and Germany are worthy of our imitation. (4) Chen Changheng on several major economic issues and review of fiscal problems in the period of national crisis: First, he stated that there are three main elements of war: 1. People, 2. Finance, and 3. Machines. Our country has shortcomings in all of these. Next, he described in detail how to effectively supplement people and finance. In addition, the theses of Xiong Lingxiao, Wang Yutong, and others on finance in extraordinary times all advocated the collection of consumption and enjoyment taxes such as income tax and inheritance tax. Only Dong Xiujia's thesis on financial management strategies in extraordinary times did not advocate the adoption of tax increase policies that the people opposed too much, but suggested the expansion of paper currency and internal and external public debt policies that the people would not feel too much pain in the short term. Other theses by Zhu Qifu, Liu Fushu, etc. on the path that should be taken in agricultural finance and the problem of railway freight rates in extraordinary times are omitted.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Telegrams from Members</p>
<p>Members Chen Guangfu and Xiao Chunjin, who were unable to attend the meeting due to circumstances, sent congratulatory telegrams from Xuzhou and other places. (1) Chen Guangfu in Xuzhou: "Due to circumstances in Xu, I am unable to participate in the grand event, and I am extremely sorry. I imagine you all expounding great theories to save the times and benefit the people. I hereby congratulate you." (2) Ge Yufu in Jinan, transferred by Cao Lishun of Jiaotong University: "Zhaohuan, Guobao, Xulun, Zhihuan, and all attendees, greetings. I wish the annual meeting of our society progress and the prosperity of academic theory." (3) Xiao Chunjin in Nanchang, Jiangxi, transferred by Liu Dajun to the society: "Chunjin is unable to attend due to circumstances. I wish the annual meeting success and contribute to the construction of the national economy." (4) Mai Jianzeng, Director of the Guangzhou Finance Bureau: "I recently read in the newspaper that I am delighted to learn that our society is holding its twelfth annual meeting, with many talents gathering and each showing their expertise, and many effective constructions. I have returned south to Baiyue and hold a position in the city's finance. I am burdened with official duties and unable to attend, so I send a special congratulatory telegram."</p>

Because the minister is going to Beijing on official business, I am temporarily representing him to welcome you. You are all economists or industrialists. The minister, standing in the position of the financial authorities, sincerely welcomes you. He is very sorry that he could not come to host you in person today. As for what the minister wants to say to you, he has already said it in detail at the annual meeting yesterday. I can omit it. Please drink more." Then Chen Changheng, the director of the Nanjing branch, gave a reply on behalf of the participating members, saying, "The Central Bank is the hub of our country's financial economy. Since the implementation of the legal currency policy last year, its position has become more important. It is not only a national bank, but also a bank of banks, leading industry and commerce, and developing the national economy. The responsibility is very important. The so-called two words of economy, we can interpret as 'managing the country and helping the people.' I hope that the members of our society can make more efforts in the academic field, and I also hope that the Central Bank can promote various economic undertakings step by step, so that academic theory and practical work can be linked to each other and move forward together, in order to achieve the goal of 'managing the country and helping the people' and realize the ideal of President Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood."

<h3 id="e93">Executive Yuan Has Issued an Order to Adopt National Goods Raincloth; Appropriate Handling of Increasing Tariff Rates on Foreign Goods; Ministry of Industry Notified the National Goods Association Yesterday <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry notified the China National Goods Maintenance Association yesterday, stating, "The Executive Yuan previously delegated the association's request to clarify three points for distinguishing between national goods raincoats and lacquer cloths and non-national goods, requesting an order to adopt them, and to increase the import tariff rate on foreign goods raincoat cloths. It has been ordered to adopt them, and the Ministry of Finance has been consulted on the matter of increasing the import tariff rate on foreign goods raincoat cloths. The association has been notified of the case. The Ministry of Finance's Guanzi No. 30004 dated September 17, 25, stated, 'The Ministry of Industry's Gongzi No. 16514 dated July 20 of this year requested the China National Goods Maintenance Association to increase the import tariff rate on foreign goods raincoat cloths. Please check and handle the matter.' The Secretariat of the Executive Yuan also sent a letter to the ministry, which was handed over to the National Tariff Commission for investigation and reply. The ministry re-examined that the current lowest market price of foreign cotton raincoat cloth in Shanghai is about 40 cents per yard, and the cost is at most 30 cents per yard in national currency. The cost of domestic goods blank cloth is about 20 cents per yard, and the processing is at least 30 cents, totaling 50 cents. Compared with each other, the price of each yard of goods is already 10 cents apart, which proves that in the future, domestic goods raincoat cloth will have to strive to reduce costs in manufacturing in order to compete with foreign goods. As for the import tariff rate on foreign goods raincoat cloth, it has now been levied at 25% ad valorem. The matter of so-called raising the tariff rate should be re-examined and handled when the tariff rules are amended in the future. In addition to replying to the letter, it should be notified to your ministry for your reference." Special notification, Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, September 26, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Expansion of the Shanghai-Hankou Line by Nisshin Causes Panic in Our Shipping Industry; Just as the Shipping Industry Slightly Recovers, Japanese Merchants Come to Compete with Us <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Nisshin Steamship Company has six commercial ships operating between Shanghai and Hankou: Yueyang, Ruiyang, Luoyang, Xiangyang, and Fengyang. In view of the flourishing cargo transportation between Shanghai and Hankou, the existing ships are not enough to operate. The company has now decided to add the two ships Dazhen and Daji starting from October 1. According to the shipping industry in this city, Nisshin's addition of commercial ships to operate on the Shanghai-Hankou line is intended to compete with the commercial ships on the Shanghai-Hankou line. However, it is not because of the development of business that they are adding ships. At a time when our country's shipping industry is slightly recovering, this move by Japanese merchants is indeed destroying the alliance sharing system. If measures are not taken to stop it urgently, the future of our shipping industry will inevitably be greatly affected.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Public Security Bureau Announces the Unveiling of the Xuan Sheng Case: Most of the Criminals are Notorious Repeat Offenders - Confessions of Mao and Wang <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's unveiling of the Xuan Sheng case, involving criminals Wang Zhensheng, Mao Yonghu, Zhao Yunhong, etc., has been briefly reported in previous news. The investigation of the case has concluded, and the entire case has been sent to the local court for trial. Now, the bureau publishes detailed information about the case, as recorded below:</p>
<p>Informant's Tip-Off</p>
<p>Since our bureau cracked down on Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, Jin Daoquan, and others in the Jiande Apartment last time for plotting to continue assassinating Japanese people, interrogation revealed that many key criminals involved in the assassination of Xuan Sheng were still at large. The Detective Brigade was immediately ordered to continue a rigorous investigation. Soon, a confidential informant reported that the criminals in this case were mostly notorious repeat offenders who had secretly discussed the matter at Zhao's house beforehand and distributed rewards at the Huashang Hotel afterward. The informant knew that these criminals often frequented the house of a Zhang family at No. 72 Shachang Street, Zhonghua Road, to plot their actions. Consequently, officers were dispatched with the informant to keep watch at the address, ready to capture them at the opportune moment.</p>
<p>Apprehension of the Criminals</p>
<p>The officers waited until 7:00 PM on the 25th of this month when they saw Mao Yonghu approaching slowly. As he neared the entrance of No. 72, they immediately stepped forward, apprehended him, and took him to the bureau. Meanwhile, they continued to wait. The next day (i.e., the 26th), Wang Zhensheng was captured at the bureau. According to Mao's confession, another criminal, Wang Zhensheng, was hiding at No. 10 Bao'an Branch Road. Thus, on the evening of the 27th, at 10:00 PM, they went to ask Zhang Rongfu's wife at No. 72 Shachang Street. After obtaining the information, they rushed to arrest him around 11:00 PM that night. Zhang was out and hadn't returned, so his wife, Zhang Ma's, was detained at the bureau for strict questioning. She confessed that Wang had moved to No. 46 Gongkuanli, Yangjiabang Road. They then escorted her to point out the location, and Wang and his wife, Wang Wang's, were arrested and taken to the bureau. This is a general account of the apprehension of the criminals at the time.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Interrogation</p>
<p>According to Mao Yonghu's confession, on June 26th or 27th of this year, he met with Li Ruiwu at Zhao Yunhong's house. Li said he wanted to kill an enemy and would pay 200 yuan to anyone willing to do it. At the time, I even helped him find someone to do it. Later, I found Wang Zhensheng, who was willing to do it, and accompanied him to Zhao's house to negotiate with Li. We also went to North Sichuan Road to look at the enemy. Li pointed out a Japanese person walking on the road, and that's when we knew we were going to kill a Japanese person. At the time, Wang Zhensheng said it wasn't convenient to act there. So the next day, I, Wang, and Li went to Qimei Road to scout the area. Li and Wang both said that this place was a good place to strike. So on July 4th, I went to Zhao's house, and Li immediately gave me ten yuan, telling me to go with Wang to check out No. 10 Bao'an Branch Road, Qimei Road. I paid five yuan for the rental fee. On July 5th, Wang Zhensheng and his wife moved from No. 71 Shachang Street, Nanshi, to No. 10 Bao'an Branch Road, Qimei Road. The next day (i.e., July 6th), Li told me to go with Wang to Qimei Road to check out the situation. So I went with Wang for a walk around the area. On the 7th, Li gave me a six-round revolver, a few bullets, I didn't pay attention. I gave the gun to Wang Zhensheng. Around 8:00 PM that evening, Wang and I went to near the intersection of Disiwei Road and Qihua Road and stood on opposite sides. We saw a Japanese couple walking by. Wang immediately tried to shoot, but he pulled the trigger several times, and it wouldn't fire. The Japanese people were frightened and ran away. On the 8th, Li sent another White Langlin pistol and a few bullets. I didn't see it clearly either and handed it over to Wang again. Around 8:00 PM that evening, Wang and I went to the old spot at the intersection of Disiwei Road and Qimei Road to wait. Soon, we saw a Japanese person walking by, and he tried to shoot again, but it wouldn't fire. On July 10th, Li gave me another revolver, six bullets. That evening, around 8:00 PM, Wang and I stood under a small tree opposite the ice cream stand on Qimei Road. Coincidentally, a Japanese person wearing Japanese clothes, holding a child in his arms, with another child following behind, walked from north to south, from Qimei Road to the Dongyang Garden on Disiwei Road. About ten minutes later, this Japanese person came out of the garden again, walking from south to north. At that time, Wang followed behind the Japanese person, about four or five steps apart, and then fired the gun, hitting the Japanese person, who fell to the ground. I fled towards Disiwei Road and immediately returned to the Changfa Hotel in Dongxinqiao. Wang also fled back. I asked Wang, and Wang said he had hit him, and the gun was lost, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Wang Zhensheng's confession, the situation was almost entirely consistent with Mao Yonghu's confession. He also admitted to the gun misfiring on the evenings of the 7th and 8th. However, regarding the events of the evening of the 10th, he said that Mao Yonghu took out the gun that Wang had hidden on his body, and then Mao fired the gun, hitting Xuan Sheng. Then he gave the gun back to Wang. Wang then fled east to Hujia Muqiao and buried the gun in the garbage heap under the bridge before fleeing back to the Changfa Hotel, etc. According to Wang Zhensheng, on the evenings of the 7th and 8th, Wang Zhensheng fired the gun, and on the evening of the 10th, Wang carried the gun on his person. It is implausible that Mao took the gun and fired it and then returned it to Wang. Therefore, Wang Zhensheng is undoubtedly the main culprit in this case. (It was verified that the incident on the evening of July 7th, when Mao and Wang were firing the gun near the intersection of Disiwei Road and Qimei Road, but it misfired and the Japanese person fled in shock, was likely the Kurimoto incident, but it was on the 6th and not the 7th (or the record may be incorrect).) Further investigation revealed that Zhao Yunhong's confession regarding the pre-arrangement was no different from Mao Yonghu's confession. Two days later, Zhao went to the Huashang Hotel, and Mao and Li Ruiwu also came. Li took out 200 yuan and gave it to Mao. Mao took out 100 yuan, saying he had to give it to another person. The remaining 100 yuan was given to Wang Zhensheng (50 yuan), Zhao Yunhong (10 yuan), and Mao kept 30 yuan for himself. A day later, Li Ruiwu introduced a man in a suit called the Chief of Staff to meet me in the French Park, and he gave me a lot of encouragement, etc. According to the previous arrestee Jin Daoquan, this so-called Chief of Staff was actually Hua Kezhi. Furthermore, the main culprit in this case, Wang Zhensheng, is Mao Yonghu's sworn brother, and Mao's father is Zhao Yunhong's apprentice. Zhao was entrusted by Li Ruiwu, and Li was acting under the secret orders of Hua Kezhi. Therefore, the mastermind behind this case is undoubtedly Hua Kezhi.</p>
<p>Retrieval of the Gun and Inspection</p>
<p>Based on the confession of the main culprit Wang Zhensheng, the next morning (the 18th), at around 7:00 AM, officers were dispatched with Wang to Hujia Muqiao, where they retrieved the gun from the mud in the garbage heap under the bridge. A film was taken. Then, officers were dispatched to the Public Concession Police Station's gun examination room to examine the gun. It was verified that the gun was a .32 caliber, American-made, six-chamber revolver, brand name Smith &amp; Wesson. It was also found that in the six chambers, five chambers still contained five unfired bullets, and one chamber contained one fired cartridge case. The chamber with the cartridge case was in the center of the firing pin, so it could be determined that it was the chamber from which the shot was fired. It can also be determined that only one shot was fired, and the trigger was only pulled once. However, the bullets in the gun were all French-made F.N. brand automatic pistol steel-jacketed bullets, not the original bullets for the revolver. It can be determined that the intention was to reduce the sound of the explosion when fired, to avoid the attention of passersby, and to confuse the police so that it would be difficult to identify the type of gun used. It was also found that the four numbers etched on the outside of the gun barrel had been filed off in advance, and the marks of the file were still faintly visible. However, they did not know that there was a number etched on the inside of the gun barrel, which had not been erased. This proves that the criminals in this case had a very tight organization and had considered it carefully before acting, which is completely different from ordinary assassinations. After test firing, the traces of the rifling on the bullet head, the spiral lines on the bottom of the cartridge case, and the firing pin marks were compared meticulously with the bullet head taken from Xuan Sheng's head in the hospital and the traces of the rifling and spiral lines and the firing pin marks on the cartridge case taken from the gun chamber this time. They were identical, without any difference. Therefore, it can be determined that the bullet head taken from Xuan Sheng's head was fired from that gun (17 inspection photos have been submitted to the court).</p>
<p>Conclusion of the Case</p>
<p>After the arrest of Mao and Zhao, Jin Daoquan and others were sent back to our bureau by the police. Jin was immediately brought to face Mao and Zhao, and both sides confessed that they knew each other, but Mao and Zhao called Jin "Little Wang" and "Old Three." Jin also admitted that when Liu Laosi introduced him to Mao and Zhao, he referred to him as Wang Laosan. However, Mao and Zhao also pointed out that the person who introduced them was Li Ruiwu, and the descriptions of Liu and Li's appearance and the number of times Liu (i.e., Li) brought Jin to meet Mao and Zhao were completely identical. Therefore, it was known that Liu Laosi was an alias for Li Ruiwu. From this, it can be seen that the secret organization led by Hua Kezhi is completely no different from the Communist Party organization. There is only a vertical relationship and no horizontal relationship. The strictness can be imagined. Furthermore, the descriptions of the assassination of Xuan Sheng given by the arrestees in this case are the same as the descriptions of Zhang Shimin's leading Zhu Guisheng et al. to assassinate Nakayama Hideo given by the criminals Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming arrested by our bureau last time in the Jiande Apartment, and the descriptions of Hua Kezhi's leading Zhu Guisheng, Jin Daoquan, Chen Enming et al. to plot to continue assassinating Japanese people given by Jin Daoquan. The intention and strategy are exactly the same. Furthermore, Zhang Shimin and Hua Kezhi are both Wang Yaqiao's top cadres. From this, it can be clearly shown that the previous assassinations of Japanese people were a consistent sabotage policy of Wang Yaqiao's reactionary organization. As a result of our bureau's efforts to investigate each case, we have fully understood the location of their conspiracy. Therefore, for the sake of eliminating the source of chaos for the party and the country, for the sake of consolidating the security of this city, and for the sake of the safety of the lives and property of Chinese and foreign people, we will further collaborate with the police authorities of the concessions to rigorously search for and arrest the remnants of the reactionary organization, in order to completely eliminate such ominous events.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports that Mr. Uehara, Deputy Chief of the Public Works Department Police, who is in charge of investigating the case of the murdered Japanese sailor Gang Tian, stated yesterday (the 27th) that he is confident in the results of his investigation. He said that he hopes that the clues obtained will yield gratifying results in a short period of time. However, it is not yet convenient to officially reveal their nature. Uehara is currently working with two Western detectives and several Chinese and Japanese detectives to handle the case.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the Public Works Department Police confirmed today that the Chinese authorities are currently engaged in arresting Wang and Xia, the leaders of the Hongmen Society, because they are both involved in the assassination of Dean and the murder of the Japanese Xuan Sheng.

<p>The Chinese Marine Engineers Association sent a letter to the Inspector General of Customs of the Jianghai Customs requesting a modification of the age limit for marine engineers. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, we recently read in the newspaper that your department's marine vessel section plans to recruit many marine engineers, in order to select talents to benefit customs affairs. The intention is far-reaching and admirable. However, there seems to be room for discussion regarding the age limit. Our association takes the liberty of requesting a slight increase. If the limit could be set at 22 to 40 years old, it would be more appropriate. Our association has more than a thousand members with extensive service experience, which can be said to be abundant. However, the average age is over 30 and around 40, which is very different from your department's limit. If it is not slightly changed, it will inevitably lead to the loss of the qualification to take the exam, which seems to violate your department's main purpose of selecting true talents. We are sending this letter specifically, hoping that you will make accommodations to show fairness. Furthermore, we hope that equal emphasis will be placed on academic knowledge and experience in the exam subjects. We sincerely hope for your consideration and reply to our humble request and maintain our public friendship."</p>

<p>Since the Legislative Yuan passed the new Salt Law last October, the Salt Authority has been actively rectifying various provincial salt fields, improving field production, and preventing tax evasion. However, China's salt affairs have long-standing problems, such as the private merchant allocation system, which is difficult to abolish immediately. Therefore, the implementation of the new Salt Law is not easy. The prerequisite is to rectify the salt fields. Currently, the salt fields in various provinces that have achieved concrete success in rectification are Shandong, Lianghuai, and Changlu, while the rectification project in Zhejiang, except for salt fields in Yuyao and other places, cannot be completed within the year. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Salt Authority to implement the new Salt Law in stages by region. The first places to implement the new Salt Law will be the Changlu, Shandong, and Lianghuai salt fields. The implementation of tax collection and free trade can begin in November. However, the implementation of the new Salt Law in the Zhejiang salt fields may not be realized in the short term. As for the implementation of the new Salt Law in Liangguang, it is still pending.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Amidst the Currency Reform in France, the French Exchange Rate Hits an Unprecedented Low: A Continuing Downward Trend, China is Less Affected <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent capital flight, the French government is implementing a new currency policy, devaluing the French franc, and abolishing the gold standard. After the gold was nationalized, the international exchange rate was greatly shaken. All related countries have taken new measures to cope with the situation. Since China's exports to France are limited, it is less affected. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Bank of China Nominal Price</p>
<p>On the morning of the 28th, the Bank of China's quoted exchange rate was 582 French francs per 100 national currency units, which was a nominal price, not an actual transaction price. Compared with the closing price of 464.25 French francs on Saturday, it was a decrease of 118 French francs, which can be described as an unprecedented drop. The exchange rates of other countries, such as London at 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, New York at 30 gold dollars, Berlin at 76 marks, Japan at 103 yen, and Hong Kong at 97 Hong Kong dollars, remained the same as last week, with no change. According to economic experts, based on the current international trend, the value of the French franc may continue to decline. It will only gradually stabilize after the French government officially announces the new currency law.</p>
<p>Gold Price Rises Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose sharply again. The opening price in the morning was 1155 yuan, a sharp increase of 14.3 yuan compared to last Saturday (the day before). The buying interest was still high, and it once rose to outside the 60 yuan mark. The fluctuation was more than 10 yuan within a few minutes. The closing price in the morning was 1156.7 yuan, an increase of 1.7 yuan. After the opening in the afternoon, it soared, and the opening price was 1157.8 yuan. The buying momentum was still rising, and it immediately rose outside the 60 yuan mark, and the highest price was 1163.3 yuan. It then fell slightly to 1157.1 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 1161.7 yuan. The increase was 6.7 yuan for the day, a huge increase of 21 yuan compared to last week.</p>

<p>The warehouse built by the Palace Museum in Beijing has been completed, and the antiquities stored in Shanghai will be transported to Beijing for preservation. A reporter visited Ouyang Banghua, the section chief of the Palace Museum's Shanghai office. He said that there are a total of 20,000 boxes of antiquities stored in Shanghai, of which 13,000 boxes are Palace Museum antiquities. Since the joint inspection with various agencies began, it has taken one year, and three-quarters have been inspected, with the remainder still being inspected. The Nanjing warehouse has been completed, and the antiquities stored in Shanghai will be transported to Beijing for preservation. They are currently consulting with the museum on transportation methods. It is expected that the transportation to Beijing will begin gradually in the middle of next month, and they plan to transport them by train. The items that have not been inspected will be transported to Beijing for continued inspection. Once all the antiquities have been transported, the Shanghai office will be closed, and all staff will be transferred back to the museum to work. After the antiquities are transported to Beijing, a portion will be selected for display.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Cheng Linsheng and Nephew Accused of Forging Leases to Conceal Assets – Rootai Factory’s Annual Rent Only 4,000 Yuan, While the Lease Term Extends to 20 Years – Creditors Deem It Absolutely Suspicious <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Linsheng, a wealthy businessman from Shexian, Huizhou, who made his fortune in real estate in Shanghai, and his nephew, Yi Ze, founded the Rootai United Flour Mill. Due to business failure and mounting debts, the Cheng family gathered creditors in the past to discuss a plan to repay all debts in installments and continue operations. Unexpectedly, the factory was suddenly leased to Hu Xiannan from Shexian, who added the characters "Yi Ji" to the brand name to distinguish it. This leasing behavior dissatisfied creditors, leading to numerous lawsuits against the Cheng family. Now, De Tai Yun Ji Industrial Raw Materials Company, a creditor of the factory, claims that Yun Qing, due to Rootai owing them over 21,000 yuan in goods, obtained a court judgment for repayment. When applying to the court for enforcement and seizure of the factory, Hu Xiannan stepped forward to object. Therefore, Zhang accused Hu of colluding with the Cheng family to forge leases, conceal assets, and harm creditors. He filed a criminal self-lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court against the two Chengs and Hu, stating that the Rootai factory’s assets are worth 200,000 yuan, and its annual profit is 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. However, the lease contract with Hu Xiannan specifies an annual rent of only 4,000 yuan and a term as long as 20 years. It is as if the two Chengs are willing to gift Hu an annual surplus of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. If this had nothing to do with the creditors' rights, private gifts would not be prohibited by law. However, with this contract in place, all the factory’s assets, business, customers, trademarks, etc., are bound by the 20-year fake lease. When auctioned, no one will likely inquire, making enforcement impossible. As a result, the Cheng family's debt to the plaintiff will be completely unrecoverable and seized by Hu. If there were no fake lease, only half a year's profit from the factory would be sufficient to repay the plaintiff's debt. Now, using the fake lease as a smokescreen, they are completely concealing the factory's assets and profits, which is extremely illegal. Furthermore, Hu is originally a retainer of the Cheng family, lacking both the funds and experience to run a factory. Yet, he appears to sign the lease. Their plan to jointly forge, conceal assets, harm the plaintiff's creditors, and share the spoils is self-evident, fitting the descriptions in Articles 211, 356, and 28 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, it is specifically requested that the court review and approve the summons of the three defendants for punishment according to law. Moreover, according to Hu Xiannan's objection in another case, he admitted to earning a daily surplus of 156 yuan. Based on this calculation, his monthly income is 4,680 yuan. Hu has been operating Rootai with a false lease, continuing business for 17 months, obtaining an illegal profit of 79,560 yuan. He should be ordered to return a portion of it to sufficiently repay the plaintiff's debt, punishing the deceitful and protecting rights, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide conducted the trial. Both Chengs avoided appearing in court, but Hu arrived with his defense lawyer, Li Lin. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Ming, presented the reasons for the lawsuit and submitted all evidence to question the defendant. Hu claimed that he continued to trade with the plaintiff after leasing the factory, and the plaintiff initially had no questions, firmly denying the forgery of the lease. The court adjourned the hearing to investigate further and retry the case later.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Around the Mid-Autumn Festival in the Lunar Calendar, the Tidal Surge in the Huangpu River Was Not High – It Will Not Overflow the Banks Unless There Is Wind and Rain – Recent Situation of the Dredging of the Shuntan Shoal <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau yesterday, the dangerous period for the autumn flood tide in the Huangpu River has passed. Although there will still be several days of high tide at the beginning of the month, the levels will be lower than last month, unaffected by weather, and not worth noting. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Huangpu River High Tide Period Passed</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, although the 3rd of next month is the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, traditionally believed to be a day of significant tidal surge, the Bureau predicts that the highest tides on that day will occur at 1:39 AM (predicted at 11 feet 1 inch) and 10:59 PM (predicted at 11 feet 3 inches). Compared to the high tides of last month, these are lower. Therefore, if there is no bad weather or strong winds and heavy rain, there is no fear of the tide reaching the shore.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Dredging of the Shuntan Shoal</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reporter also learned that since the Bureau dispatched the "Construction" dredging vessel to dredge the Shuntan Shoal outside the Wusongkou, 5 million tons of sediment have been dredged. Once the second dredging vessel is completed and joins the dredging efforts, the initial dredging work (deepening the depth from 17 feet at low tide to 26 feet) can be completed within five years. This will allow heavily loaded ships to enter and exit the Wusongkou without obstruction, significantly contributing to the prosperity of Shanghai's commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Leather Goods Guild Notice: Members Required to Join by Deadline <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Leather Goods Industry Guild issued a notice yesterday to all leather goods manufacturers in the city, stating: This notice concerns membership. Since its establishment, the Guild has been active for several months, and membership enrollment has been enthusiastic. It has come to our attention that some manufacturers, misunderstanding the law and the organizational procedures of the Industry Guild Law, have attempted to organize their own industry guilds, submitting three applications that have been repeatedly rejected by the Municipal Party Headquarters. Now, the Guild has repeatedly sent personnel to solicit membership from those manufacturers, but they have all cited reasons such as "Golden Fortune," "Thai Abundance," "Mainland," and others also planning to organize guilds, using these as excuses to delay and refuse to join. This behavior not only hinders the Guild's work but also violates the law. Therefore, we specifically notify all leather goods manufacturers to promptly come to the Guild within seven days to fill out application forms and join the Guild to comply with the law. Please do not delay. Otherwise, the Guild will have no choice but to comply with the instructions of higher authorities and take legal action.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Family Model Exhibition to Be Extended for One Week <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The family models on display on the fourth floor of the Great New Company are collected by Zhou Xiyi, Zhou Lezhi, and Kun Li from Wuxian. Since the exhibition was initiated by artists Ding Song, Hu Boxiang, and Wu Tianweng earlier this month, more than 30,000 to 40,000 people have visited. Social celebrities such as Arnold, the American Commercial Counselor, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Mayor Wu, Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Director Cai of the Public Security Bureau have all visited to appreciate the exhibits. All the raw materials for the various models are domestic products. For example, a table and chair are only a few inches large, and a bowl and cup are only the size of a bean, but they are meticulously crafted from rosewood and fine porcelain to resemble the real thing. The rest, such as wedding and funeral ceremonies, are related to customs and historical evolution, which have been like this for a hundred years. In the future, it will be impossible to trace them. Especially city dwellers and Westerners value them. Movie merchants and Western newspaper reporters have even requested to produce sound movies and to take them to Hong Kong and London for exhibition. This shows the appreciation of society. The exhibition period was originally scheduled to end on the Mid-Autumn Festival, but there have been recent requests from various circles in the mainland to extend the exhibition. The organizers will discuss this and may extend it for one week.</p>

<p>He Ruichen, a 41-year-old Shandong native, has been selling fruit for a living. Fifteen years ago, he married He Xie, also from his hometown, and they lived together at 797 Qu Zhenren Road in Nanshi, raising a daughter who is now 13 years old. Unexpectedly, He Xie recently became restless and had an affair with Dong Xiyuan from Shandong. On the 14th of this month, she eloped with Dong, taking with her over 80 yuan in property, and they lived together at 1398 Yutong Lane, Robert Road in western Shanghai, as if they were husband and wife. After his wife's elopement, He Ruichen searched everywhere. On the 20th of this month, he encountered Dong Xiyuan, his wife's paramour, in Zhabei, and they argued, followed by a physical fight. Dong was stabbed with small scissors by He at the time. They were both handed over to the Public Security Bureau. Because the matter involved abduction and injury, they were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Due to insufficient evidence, the prosecutor ordered both parties to be dismissed without prosecution. Later, He Ruichen twisted Dong's younger brother, Dong Xixiu, and brought him to the Ximen Public Security Bureau, providing Dong Xiyuan's hiding place. Detective Lian Mingsheng, accompanied by Dong Xixiu, went to the Putuo Road Police Station to request assistance on the day before yesterday. The head of the police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to 1398 Yutong Lane, Robert Road. As expected, they saw Dong Xiyuan and He Xie lying in the same bed. They were both taken to the police station. Although He Xie admitted to adultery with Dong, she pointed out that He Ruichen was not her official husband either, only having a cohabitation relationship. The police station immediately ordered He Ruichen to provide formal marriage certificates. However, he was unable to provide them at the time, so Dong and He Xie were released by the police station at around 8 a.m. on the morning before yesterday. They hired two rickshaws and returned to their home in Yutong Lane. Unexpectedly, He Ruichen, at that time, stole a kitchen knife from the Wang family at 1398 Yutong Lane and hid a bayonet. He ambushed at the entrance of the alley. Upon seeing Dong arrive, he rushed forward with the kitchen knife and slashed twice. Dong dodged the first strike, but the second strike hit Dong's right wrist. Dong fled in pain. Upon seeing this, He Xie hurriedly got out of the rickshaw and fled, but He caught up and stabbed her several times in the right arm and chest with the bayonet he had hidden. She fell to the ground with serious injuries. Chinese policeman No. 2482 arrived, took the injured to the hospital separately, and took He, along with the two murder weapons, to the Putuo Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the 8th Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, charged him with attempted murder under Article 271, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and theft under Article 320, presenting the case. He said that He Xie was seriously injured and is currently in the hospital. He requested that the hearing be postponed. According to Dong Xiyuan, he admitted to having an affair with He Xie for only a few days and described the circumstances of being stabbed by the defendant. When questioned, He Ruichen admitted to the assault. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the confessions and ordered the defendant to be detained for a retrial next Tuesday.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Fujian Native Association Contacts Compatriots at Home and Abroad to Promote Economic Construction in Fujian Province <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Fujian Native Association in Shanghai, realizing that the national situation is becoming increasingly dangerous and that rural Fujian Province is bankrupt, believes that there is no way to save the country and survive without starting with economic construction. Therefore, it was decided at the sixth standing committee meeting to send letters to compatriots at home and abroad to jointly seek the welfare of their hometown and promote economic construction in Fujian Province. It is reported that the content of the letter is quite important. It is recorded below: Our Fujian Province is near the sea, and transportation is convenient. In the past, during the closed-door era, Fujian merchants' footprints spread all over the north and south of the country. After the opening of ports, Shanghai rose as a major trading port. Fellow countrymen from Jiangsu and Ningbo successively moved to Shanghai, but each established their own organizations. There are Quanzhang Guild Hall, Jinhui Guild Hall, and Xing'an Guild Hall in southern Fujian. There are Sanshan and Funing Guild Hall in eastern Fujian, and Shayong Public Office in northern Fujian. There are also organizations such as Yongding Guild Hall in western Fujian. They are not connected to each other, and their ability to act externally is weak. Their benefit to their fellow countrymen is inevitably limited. Since the restoration, more and more villagers have arrived, but they are still scattered. Those who know this are worried and urgently advocate the establishment of the Fujian Native Association in Shanghai to unite their friendship. Many fellow countrymen have expressed their support, and it was established. Up to now, more than a dozen general meetings have been convened. The officials of each session are respectful of their hometown and have worked hard to learn and plan. The scale is roughly in place. When refugees were stranded in Shanghai and could not return home, the association would verify the facts and send them back to their hometown. If they were deceived and had no way to appeal, they would also do their best to help them. Other good deeds, such as resolving difficulties and helping the poor, are all done together. Not only that, but in the past, when the military departments were rampant and arbitrarily increased troops, the association was deeply concerned that the more troops stationed, the heavier the burden on the people of Fujian. Together with the Fujian Governor, they prevented the troop recruitment ships from passing through Shanghai and actively negotiated with the shipping companies to prevent them from being transported to Fujian. This not only protects the legal rights and interests of the fellow countrymen in Shanghai but also reduces the suffering of all the fellow countrymen in Fujian. When the National Revolutionary Army launched the Northern Expedition and established the capital in Nanjing, more and more villagers came and went, and the association's position became even more important than before. Moreover, at a time when strong neighbors are watching us like tigers and dangers abound, if we stick to old rules and do not seek to unite, we will not be able to save the country and survive. Therefore, in the summer of this year, we decided to revise the constitution, re-establish the plan, expand the solicitation of members, and raise funds to support various public welfare undertakings and the economic construction of our Fujian Province. In recent months, we have divided into teams to solicit members. Thanks to the efforts of fellow countrymen in persuading and raising funds, the results have been considerable. However, this matter is of great importance, and it will not be successful without the joint efforts of everyone. We hope that fellow countrymen at home and abroad will join us in this great endeavor. Whether it is an organization or an individual, we welcome everyone to participate. You have always been concerned about the country and enthusiastic about public welfare, and you have been admired by fellow countrymen everywhere. If you would check the second article and the second item of the fourth article of the association's constitution and approve joining as a special director or special member of the association, we would be able to maintain permanent contact, jointly seek to save our hometown, and consolidate the foundation of the association. This would not only be a blessing for the fellow countrymen in Shanghai but also a blessing for the entire Fujian Province.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Blood Soul Assassination Squad to Be Sent to Second Special Court for Trial: Doctor Li Zhongzhang Released for Lack of Involvement, Others to Await Investigation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Blood Soul Assassination Squad members Wang Tiemin, Wang Dongcai, Yin Jiafu, Fu Chaofu, Liu Hantao, Guan Yaoting, and suspect Dong Zhongzhang, etc., were arrested for throwing bombs at stores in the International Settlement. After the First Special District Court filed a public prosecution, Judge Qian Hongye tried the case. In addition to declaring Dong Zhongzhang not guilty, the remaining were sentenced to imprisonment. The Legal Police Department, because there were similar cases in the French Concession, requested the Second Court to send a detective to the First Special District Court to transfer Liu Hantao, Chuan Chaofu, Yin Jiafu, Wang Liancai, Guan Yaoting, and Dong Zhong, etc. The transfer was made to the Special Court on the 14th of this month, requesting detention and investigation, and a retrial on another day. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the date for the continuation of the trial arrived. In the morning, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special Court came to the First Criminal Court for questioning. The defense lawyers appointed by the defendants, Wu Peng, Fan Gang, and Wu Linkun, also came to the court to await instructions. According to the Legal Police Department lawyer Fei Xizhen, the Legal Police Department found no involvement of the sixth defendant, Dong Zhongzhang, and will not prosecute him, requesting that he be released first. The remaining five defendants are suspected of violating Articles 151, 154, and 187 of the Criminal Law, hindering order and public safety. Because the case is complicated and the investigation is not yet completed, it is requested that the deadline be extended again, and the trial will be requested after the investigation is completed. The court reviewed the report and questioned the defendants briefly, then ordered that Dong Zhongzhang be released, the remaining defendants were returned to custody, and the retrial was scheduled for October 1. It is understood that the third defendant, Yin Jiafu, in this case, was previously arrested by the French police and sent to the Second Special Court for a similar case. Lawyer Wu Mai was involved in the case. Yin was sentenced to four months in prison and given a suspended sentence.</p>

The following is an excerpt of the Association's welcome and farewell speeches: "Today is the annual banquet of the General Association of Chinese Employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council, also a farewell to retiring Chief Executive Mr. J.T. Ess and a welcome to the newly appointed Chief Executive Mr. F.M. Philip. It is a great honor for me to be able to say a few words on behalf of the Association in front of all the guests. Today's gathering can be said to be an unprecedented grand event in the history of the Association. We are extremely gratified to have the presence of the Chinese Directors, Chinese Committee Members, the current Chief Executive, and the incoming Chief Executive, the heads of various departments, the Executive Officer, senior officials of the Bureau, and leaders from all walks of life, making today's banquet the grandest and most meaningful event we have ever had. Since the establishment of the Association, it has been more than six years, and we have gone through many difficulties during this period. Although we have not yet achieved the success we ideally envisioned, it can be said that we have made some progress. On the one hand, it is due to the efforts of our colleagues and the united strength of all members, but on the other hand, we cannot forget the guidance and assistance provided by the Municipal Council authorities at all times, especially the guidance and assistance of Mr. Ess. The Association has grown from a very small scale, and in the early days, it was almost impossible to live up to its name. At that time, our first major problem was how to obtain the official recognition of the Municipal Council that the Association was a legitimate organization. After several discussions, we finally succeeded. Although the Association's representatives did not directly contact Mr. Ess at that time, we knew that the strength of his help was very great. Because of his assistance, the Association laid a very solid foundation. In the past few years, whenever the Association had questions regarding the interests of all Chinese employees or individuals that needed his help, Mr. Ess never refused. His attitude towards the representatives of the Association has always been very humble, very sincere, and very modest. His suggestions, his observations, and his teachings always give us the greatest satisfaction. Therefore, I, on behalf of the Association, would like to express our sincere gratitude to you for your assistance and kindness, which has made the relationship between the Association and you always demonstrate friendship and harmony. Now we are very sorry to hear of Mr. Ess's resignation. The Municipal Council has lost a leader who has dedicated himself to the welfare of the citizens, but we can still be comforted by the fact that Mr. Ess will still be practicing law in Shanghai in the future, so the citizens of the concession can still rely on Mr. Ess's past experience and inherent knowledge to protect our human rights and legal interests. Now, in addition to expressing my gratitude to you on behalf of all members of the Association, I also wish you a bright future and boundless happiness. Now I have another task, a task that is worth celebrating. The Municipal Council has already hired a very suitable</p>

<p>Around 8:00 PM on the 24th of this month, Boat No. 32185, owned by He Guifa, was loading yellow sand onto a sand barge on the Pulin Road section of the Yangshupu River when suddenly a large ship sailed by.  The river was roiled by a surge of waves, and the cook of the He boat, Chen Gongchang (17 years old), a native of Jiangbei, lost his footing and fell into the river, drowning. His body sank and its whereabouts were unknown.  It wasn’t until 6:00 PM the day before yesterday that the body was discovered by Chinese officers of the Maritime Customs Water Police on the beach in the Pudong Ditch.  The skin and flesh had been devoured and torn by wild dogs, a gruesome sight.  The body was immediately retrieved and sent to the Rescue Bureau by Detective Yao Guofa, dispatched by the police chief.  A court-appointed official was assigned to the bureau, and upon examination, it was found that the corpse had other wounds on its head, causing suspicion. Chen Zhenxi, the father of the deceased, repeatedly demanded justice. The coroner ordered the original detective to summon the boat boss, Tang Asan, and the boatmen Zhang Chaoren, Gao Dafu, and Xu Baoren to the court for questioning.</p>

<p>Zhang Qiyuan, age 36, from Hangzhou, Liu Zhuang, came to Shanghai by express train from Hangzhou the other day, carrying 780 yuan in cash, intending to purchase jewelry. When the train arrived at the West Station (Fanwangdu Station) at 6:32 PM, two men wearing blue cloth clothes, each holding a handgun, forbade him from making a sound, forced Zhang to a nearby secluded spot, and stole the 780 yuan in cash from Zhang's person, fleeing without a trace. He reported it to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, which dispatched officers to investigate the scene and pursue the bandits.</p>

<p>Si Wanqing, a 42-year-old native of Shaoxing, residing at No. 13, Lie Fen Nong, Jiu Mu Di, Nanshi, was, for unknown reasons, involved in a dispute around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, and was violently chopped on the head, hands, feet, and other parts of his body dozens of times with an axe by his apprentice, named Jia.  He was seriously injured and collapsed in a pool of blood. The culprit fled without a trace.  He was sent to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died at 9:15 PM that evening. The hospital reported the case to the Lao Zha Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate.  The corpse was transported to the Faelen Road Mortuary for examination.  Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body.  According to Si Yiqing, the deceased was a carpenter and my cousin.  He was chopped to death by his apprentice, and I don't know why. He has no wife or children, so please allow me to claim the body. Zhang ruled that the deceased, Si Wanqing, male, was indeed chopped to death with an axe during his lifetime, and the body was handed over to his cousin, Si Yiqing, to claim it. The responsible police station is now strictly pursuing the culprit.</p>
<h3 id="e130">China Xingye Bank - Embezzlement Discovered During Audit - Lawsuit Filed by Bankruptcy Administrator - But Lu Xihou Unwilling to Sue <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The China Xingye Bank went bankrupt two years ago, and various debts are still being cleared. The bank's bankruptcy administrators, Li Ding, Xu Yongzuo, two accountants, and lawyer Qian Shucen, investigated the accounts and discovered that the bank's managers, Qin Baoyuan and Lu Mengxiang, along with Wu Songlu, Zhou Shaopeng, Wang Zhuoying, and others, had jointly embezzled funds.  They jointly filed a criminal self-accusation of embezzlement against Qin Baoyuan and the other five with the First Special District Court in the name of Lu Xihou, a permanent director of the bank. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chuan Lin opened the court for a hearing. The defendants did not personally surrender, but Lu Xihou appeared in court and stated that he was unwilling to sue in the name of the transferee of the China Xingye Bank, because when the bank closed, he advocated such a lawsuit, but instead, he was blamed. Therefore, if they wanted to sue Qin and others, it should be done by the bankruptcy administrator. He really did not want to participate. If it was necessary for him to be named, it would have to be in the name of a creditor, because he was indeed the largest creditor of the China Xingye Bank. Lawyer Qian stated that the bankruptcy administrator was now suing in the name of Lu Xihou, purely in accordance with the law. The lawyer for the defendant Lu Mengxiang stated that since Xihou had expressed his unwillingness to sue, the case was procedurally improper and requested that it not be accepted. Judge Chuan ruled that because all the defendants had not complied with the summons to appear in court, the proceedings could not continue and postponed the hearing to the afternoon of October 13. As for the person, that is Mr. Philip, to serve in the General Office, and in the same year, he was promoted to Deputy General Manager. He has fully demonstrated that he is a capable municipal officer and has the same strengths as Mr. Ess. We believe that with such an experienced and knowledgeable person in municipal administration, the welfare of the citizens will definitely increase. We also believe that under his guidance and sponsorship, the work of the Association will definitely achieve greater success. Our colleagues will work as hard as before in the Bureau, and at the same time, the improvement of the treatment of our Chinese employees will definitely develop as it did when Mr. Ess was in office. (Omissions) At the same time, we know that Mr. Philip is a sports enthusiast. He was the head of the sports class at school and received many sports awards from the school. He participated in Cricket and football and participated in the First Trinity Boat Club rowing at Cambridge. We very much hope to use his sporting experience to help the sports work of the Chinese Staff Club in his busy schedule and develop it to an advanced stage. We also hope that under his leadership, we will gradually use the spirit of athletes to serve and entertain our colleagues. I, on behalf of all members, would like to express our warmest welcome to you.</p>

<p>The grand celebration of the film industry's purchase of an airplane for a birthday celebration was held at the Jincheng Grand Theater yesterday. The tickets were sold out long ago, and at the time, the upstairs and downstairs were full of seats, the place was packed, and the event was unprecedentedly grand. The total revenue for the day exceeded 9,000 yuan, which is quite a sum. All the performances were wonderful and lively, and all the male and female stars participating spared no effort in their performances. The finale, "All Stars Dedicate a Machine," was particularly colorful and won a lot of applause. For this event, the cinema side was purely voluntary, and no expenses were deducted. It is said that the sacrifice was huge, estimated at more than 1,000 yuan, and their enthusiasm for public good is deeply admirable. It has created an unprecedented record in cinemas.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Winner of the First Prize for the 26th Lottery Ticket <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The 26th Aviation Lottery of the National Government was drawn in public at Yiyuan on the 6th of this month. The first prize, number 095234, was sold by Huang Dasheng, a batch allotted by the Dayun Company in this city. It is reported that most of the winners this time are poor people. It is said that Wang, a worker at a restaurant in Hongkou Qiujiang Road, and Lu, a fruit vendor from Jiangbei, jointly purchased one ticket. A worker at a school in Hongkou earned two yuan in tips due to a gift from the principal. After returning, the school's dozen or so workers argued over how to distribute the small sum, causing conflict. Chen, a Hainanese worker from Shancha, stepped in to mediate, suggesting that since the amount was so small and everyone was arguing, it would be better to buy aviation lottery tickets with it. If they were lucky enough to win, they could share the money equally; if they didn't win, they could still contribute to national construction and stop the quarrel. Everyone agreed, and it turned out as they wished. Several workers at the Rihua Yarn Factory in Hongkou jointly won a ticket. A certain foreign accountant at the factory secretly won one ticket, but because the winners were secretive, it was difficult to know the details for a while. According to the bank, all ten first-prize tickets have been collected. It is also said that Zhou, a shop assistant at a grocery store in Dongxinqiao, dreamed one night that someone told him, "If you want to get rich, quickly buy the 26th Aviation Lottery ticket. If you need the number, you can call Lu Tianbao, who specializes in selling it." After waking up, he found the dream bizarre and couldn't figure it out. He told his colleagues, who ridiculed him for being obsessed with wealth. Zhou gave up on the idea. After the lottery was drawn, the first-prize number was the same as Lu Tianbao's phone number. Zhou was filled with resentment and almost went insane. This is also an interesting anecdote. The second prize sold by Huiliyuan at Laobeimen was won by Mr. Qiu of the Zhenjiang Public Security Bureau. The second prizes sold by Dafulai on Gongguan Road and Daliyuan on Fourth Road were both retail tickets and were sold in this city, with many winners, so they are not listed in detail. The 27th lottery will be drawn on October 2.</p>

<p>On the 25th of this month, at around 10:00 PM, the Huadong Shoe Store at 114 North Henan Road was entered by four bandits through the back door. They used weapons to threaten them into silence, bound the store's young owner, Gui Liangshi, and apprentices Ding Longhai and Lu Fulin with ropes, stuffed their mouths with towels, and stole more than 20 pairs of leather shoes and 25 yuan in cash. They hired two rickshaws, loaded the shoes onto them, and were about to escape when Cao, a shop assistant, returned from outside and recognized one of the robbers, Wu Xiaosheng, from Changzhou, who had previously quit the shop. He shouted for the police, and the robbers were startled and abandoned the rickshaws, fleeing in different directions. Cao went inside and, seeing that the owner and apprentices were tied up, untied them and learned of the robbery. He reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Wang Runhe and Zhang Faxiang to investigate. Around 9:00 PM the night before last, they learned that the bandits Wu Xiaosheng, Chen Donggui from Zhenjiang, Wang Agen from Anhui, and Wang Haiquan from Changzhou were hiding in Room 12 of the Wuzhou Inn at 10 Guangdong Road. They secretly went with Western detectives and arrested the four, and also detained three suspects in Room 14: Zhang Agen from Changzhou, Tang Axi from Wuxi, and Yu Agen. They confessed that their accomplice, Chen Ronglong from Jiangbei, was staying at the Lao De and Xiao Inn on Maimaquelo Road in the French Concession. They went with detectives from the French Concession Police Station and arrested Chen, and brought them all back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated the case and said that Zhang Agen, Tang Axi, Yu Agen, and Chen Ronglong were not involved in the Huadong Shoe Store robbery, but had committed multiple theft cases in the Concession. He asked for an extension to investigate further. Then, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the process of arresting the defendants. They presented the ropes that were used to bind the apprentices at the time of the robbery. Only Ding Longhai, an apprentice from the Huadong Shoe Store, appeared in court and testified about the robbery. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Zhong Qing ordered that they be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I have read in the news section of your newspaper on the 18th of this month regarding the Lu Clan Ancestral Hall and the investigation of public property, which mentioned Lu Daocui and Li Tixian colluding in illegal sales. Lu Daocui transferred the land in the Yangjing District to me in 1934, and I sold it to the Song family the following year. These were all formal transactions, with the transfer registered at the Land Bureau and a land ownership certificate transferred as proof. It is evident that what is reported in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts. I believe that your reporter relied on the contents of the lawsuit filed by Lu Zhiqing for registration, and I am deeply concerned that the outside world, not knowing the actual details, may mistakenly believe it to be true, which would harm my reputation. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Li Tixian, September 26.</p>

<p>(7)(3) Modern Pentathlon</p>
<p>(7)(4) Solemn and Grand Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>The Games, which opened on August 1st, proceeded smoothly for half a month, until the 16th, when all events were successfully completed, and a solemn and grand closing ceremony was held. The Games venue had been quiet for a long time after the end of the track and field events. On the 16th, in the afternoon, it became lively again due to the equestrian competition. More than 100,000 spectators were present from morning to night, without a break. German Chancellor Hitler, along with dignitaries from various countries, entered the venue at 5 PM and did not leave until after the closing ceremony was completed at 9:30 PM. The closing ceremony was originally scheduled to begin at 7 PM, but was delayed due to the late finish of the equestrian competition. It officially began at 8:45 PM with a 300-person orchestra playing powerful music. More than 20 searchlights were specially prepared around the venue, simultaneously emitting a deep blue light, focusing on the upper room of the venue. The entire venue was shrouded in such a mysterious color, which could not help but create a solemn feeling. At 8:50 PM, each of the 51 countries participating in the Games sent one representative, holding their national flag, to enter the venue from the west gate. The order of procession was the opposite of that at the opening ceremony. The flag bearer for our country was boxing athlete Xi Guidi. Amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the audience, the representatives of each country walked to the rostrum and lined up in a row. The president of the Games, Mr. Latour, walked from the rostrum to the microphone in the center of the venue and gave a brief closing speech. After the speech, 51 uniformed young women took flower wreaths and hung them on the flagpoles of each country. At the same time, 2,000 young men and women sang the Games anthem in unison. The Games flag was also slowly lowered amidst the sound of saluting cannons. The representatives of each country then walked out of the venue through the gate below the rostrum. At the same time, the bells rang, and the flame that had been burning for half a month was extinguished. The Games flag was carried by five uniformed staff members to the rostrum, and then escorted by eight samurai holding swords to the broadcasting platform. The mayor of Los Angeles, USA, the host city of the previous Games, officially handed it over to the mayor of Berlin for safekeeping. At the same time, the president of the Games announced that the next Games would be held in Tokyo. The flagpole on the sign raised the flags of Greece, the host country of the first Games, Germany, the host country of this Games, and Japan, the host country of the next Games. After the flags of the three countries were lowered, the glorious 11th World Games officially came to a close amidst the singing of the German national anthem by the entire audience.</p>
<p>(7)(5) Thoughts on Participating in the Games</p>
<p>The Games have come to a successful conclusion, and athletes from various countries have returned home one after another. This time, our country sent more than 100 representatives, traveling tens of thousands of miles, in a grand manner to participate in the Games. As a result, the entire army was wiped out and returned in a miserable defeat. As a reporter who personally experienced the situation, I was deeply moved and had indescribable feelings.</p>
<p>Regarding the health of the people, the representatives our country sent this time can be said to be the elite of the country. However, when they entered this world arena and compared themselves with athletes from various countries, the disparity in skills was vast, and the inferiority in physical fitness was shocking. No matter which arena, as soon as our athletes were compared with others, one could immediately feel that the others were so tall and strong, while we were so short and weak. The outcome of the competition could be predicted without even competing. For example, in the China-England football match, the skills of our players were by no means inferior to those of England. The result of the first half was as expected, without conceding a goal. However, after 45 minutes of intense battle, the players showed signs of fatigue, and they lost two goals in the second half and were eliminated. Therefore, the outcome of this football match was not judged on the merits of skill, but on the strength of physical fitness. Regarding the basketball game, the physical fitness of our players was not only far inferior to that of strong teams such as the United States and Canada, but also inferior to that of Japan. Wang Yuzeng's height cannot be considered short, but the Japanese center was half a head taller than him. The physical fitness of the other players was also far inferior to others. The situation on the track and field was even more obvious. Jia Lianren participated in the 1,500-meter preliminary, and he ran well in the first three laps, competing fiercely with famous players from various countries without showing any weakness. However, in the last lap, others were able to sprint forward with ease, while he was exhausted and fell behind. Chen Baoqiu, a shot put athlete, is known as the "Iron Ox" and has the most robust figure among all athletes. However, when mixed with the iron oxen from various countries, one could almost suspect that he had turned into a mud ox. The situation of the other team members can be imagined. In short, our country's participation in this Games was a complete defeat in terms of skills, which is certainly a national shame, but the inferiority in physical fitness should be regarded as a crisis for the nation. We should determine the direction of sports in the future. We should not only train many excellent athletes, but also pay attention to the future of the nation and strengthen everyone's health.</p>
<p>Regarding technical training, we cannot win honor for the country in this Games, and we will inevitably be completely defeated. This was something that was expected before going abroad. We cannot blame our coaches, nor can we blame our athletes. However, we must not attribute this failure to an inevitable result and dismiss it. We must take this complete defeat as the supreme shame of the country and the nation. We cannot always be willing to succumb. We must strive to make progress in technology and raise our eyebrows and exhale for the country in the next Games. Otherwise, we are weak and shameless. The international sports arena is as snobbish as the international political arena. At the opening ceremony on August 1st, when our athletes marched in, the momentum and the neat formation were no weaker than any other country. However, the film taken by Germany did not have the shadow of our delegation because they simply did not take China seriously. We should regard this as a national shame, just as we have been invaded by others. When the results of each competition were announced in the Games venue, the flagpoles on the wooden signs raised the flags of the top three winners, and the orchestra played the national anthem of the champion. We often heard more than 100,000 spectators singing the powerful and inspiring German national anthem along with the music, and we couldn't help but feel awe. We also saw the flags of the colonies of India and Egypt flying on the flagpoles in the center of the sign, and we couldn't help but feel ashamed. We couldn't see a shadow of China or hear a sound of China in the venue, and we should regard this as a national shame, just as we were being whipped. In short, we failed this time, but failure has its price, and failure has its lessons. We must learn our lessons from this failure, seize our price, and wash away our shame, unless we don't want to show our skills in the international arena again.</p>
<p>Regarding the spirit of the athletes, our athletes' participation in this Games was far inferior to others not only in terms of physical fitness and skills, but also in terms of spirit. None of the track and field athletes' results could catch up with their inherent strength. Although it is said that the fatigue of the journey and acclimatization are also important reasons, the lack of determination of the athletes is an undeniable fact. Especially the basketball team, after being defeated by the Japanese team in the first battle, their will was depressed, their spirits were scattered, and they almost disintegrated. When we look at the athletes from other countries, no matter what their strength is, their spirit of desperately fighting and not showing submission until the last second is truly admirable. Secondly, the sense of responsibility of our athletes should also be cultivated. Before the opening of the Games, the German starter, fearing that the athletes from various countries did not understand the German starting slogan, specially gathered the athletes from various countries participating in the race to practice starting and firing the gun. Athletes from various countries went to participate, but none of our athletes went. There were also one or two athletes who gave up participating in the event because they slept too late at night during the Games. These situations must be corrected. If we want to develop Chinese sports, in terms of athletes, we must cultivate the spirit of struggle and responsibility.</p>
<p>Regarding the organizational aspects, the scope of the World Games is so vast that it is difficult for those who have not personally experienced it to imagine. However, Germany managed it in an orderly manner, and the order was very good. In my previous communication, I used the eight characters "no one idle, no one without work" to describe the German's way of doing things, which is by no means an exaggeration. During the Games, no matter which part, we never saw an employee wearing a badge who was idle and had nothing to do, nor did we ever encounter a situation where we could not find someone to contact about something. But our delegation was different. The telephone at the Chinese office in the Olympic Village often rang for a long time without being answered. Athletes were sick, and no one cared about food. Even communist publications were repeatedly found in the village, and no one was taking action. With such a small organization, there are still so many flaws. Can we not be ashamed? I hope that after participating in this Games, the delegation can bring the German spirit of doing things back to the motherland. There are too many lessons that this Games has given us. There are really thousands of things to say, and I don't know where to start. I think if we can work together to transform the future of Chinese sports on the four points mentioned above, we can certainly embark on a bright path.</p>

<p>— Qinghai</p>
<p>Received a central subsidy of 80,000 yuan for free education. Due to the province's financial difficulties, it was unable to raise its own funds. There are more than 100,000 out-of-school children in the province. In the 24th year, 110 short-term primary schools were temporarily established. When the Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect this year, the newly added short-term schools enrolled 8,648 children.</p>
<p>Beiping</p>
<p>Received a central subsidy of 45,000 yuan for free education and raised 80,000 yuan from the city. There are 96,296 out-of-school children in the city. The city plans to establish 480 grades of short-term primary schools in the 24th year. When the Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect last time, it saw that only 90 grades had been established in the first semester and hoped that all grades that had not been established would be established in the second semester.</p>
<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>Received a central subsidy of 35,000 yuan for free education and originally planned to raise 120,000 yuan from the city, of which 10,000 yuan has been allocated successively. There are 80,000 out-of-school children. In the 24th year, it is planned to establish a two-part system of short-term primary schools and additional ordinary primary schools, with a total of 320 grades. Only 30 schools were established in the first semester, and the rest are planned to be added in the second semester.

<p>Shanghai</p>
<p>Received a central subsidy of 80,000 yuan for free education and originally planned to raise 90,000 yuan from the city. When the Ministry of Education investigated last time, only 30,000 yuan had been allocated.

<p>Qingdao</p>
<p>Received a central subsidy of 41,000 yuan for free education and raised 53,000 yuan from the city. Education in the city has always been popular. All villages in rural areas have schools. The popularization method is to use existing school buildings and classes to implement the two-part system. Also, because each school has enough students and no spare rooms, it is possible for students in the two-part system to use each other, so a half-day two-part system is mostly adopted to facilitate management and education. In the whole urban area, a total of four ordinary classes were added, 24 two-part classes were converted, and six new two-part classes were added. In the rural area, the single-style編制 were all changed to two-part classes. In the rural area, 20 ordinary classes were added, 34 new two-part classes were added, and 154 one-part classes were converted. The above 24 ordinary classes, 40 newly added two-part classes, and 178 one-part classes were converted. In addition, new schools were established and classes were added or changed in the newly designated urban area.

<p>Piece Goods: Yarn and Thread Prices Rise Frequently; Cotton Cloth Becomes More and More Fierce in its Rise—Various Factories Still Find it Difficult to Meet Sales Demands—Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a dramatic rise in yarn and thread prices at the end of last week, and the cotton cloth market situation also became more and more fierce in its rise. Customer agents were even more enthusiastic in their purchases. Southern merchants showed the strongest interest. Guangdong merchants added huge amounts of white goods, including coarse white cloth, fine twill, and fine cloth. However, most transactions failed to materialize due to factories being out of stock. Only over 500 pieces of Ewo 11-pound Three Cats, Three Deer coarse cloth, and Shenxin 11-pound Siping Lotus coarse cloth were secured. More than 100 cases of serge and broadcloth were also transacted. Merchants from Yunnan and Fujian were also eager to purchase but were distressed by the lack of goods to supply. Merchants from Sichuan were also active, showing great interest in printed flannelette, Zhigong satin, serge, and colored twill. At the same time, northern merchants vigorously purchased绒布,钱呢, and serge. Merchants from the interior also continued to forge ahead, and the market situation became more and more prosperous. Selling prices rose uniformly, with printed flannelette seeing the most dramatic increase, rising by one cent per yard, which is calculated to be 4.5 jiao for each 45-yard piece. Broadcloth, serge, and Zhigong satin each rose by 1.5 to 3 jiao per piece, white flannelette rose by 1 to 2 jiao, coarse cloth with heavier weights were the most in demand, rising by 1 to 2 jiao per piece, while lighter weights rose by 5 fen. Coarse twill, fine cloth, and fine twill also rose by more than 1 jiao. For example, Shenxin factory products, including various grades of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, grey cloth, and坯布, have all increased by 2 jiao per piece, and it is said that the factory does not have the goods to supply.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Yellow Broadcloth Supply Cannot Meet Demand <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The broadcloth market in general has been quite good recently. The market at the Guild is firm, and the number of people going to the Guild to certify and submit tax-paid certificates to the Customs is quite crowded. Both domestic and imported broadcloth are doing well, with yellow broadcloth having an even wider sales reach. Beijing and Hangzhou have both shown significant interest in purchasing, and the supply of Polish and domestic goods cannot meet demand. Zhanghua yellow broadcloth is therefore seizing the opportunity to increase prices by 1.5 jiao. Yesterday, domestic Zhanghua military uniform yellow broadcloth all rose to 2.60 yuan, Ewo to 2.65 yuan, Renli to 2.475 yuan, Polish goods (Huabo, Baoda, Baodali, Ruiyu, etc.) all sold for 2.60 yuan for first grade, 2.40 yuan for second grade, 1.90 yuan for third grade, and Yongfeng Unified brand for 2.35 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Securities: No Increase in Government Bond Deliveries for September; However, There Were Many Private Deliveries Outside the Market; The Market for the Whole Month Rose First and Then Fell <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 28th) was the date for the delivery of September futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The total number of deliveries was 17,763,000 yuan. Of this amount, the clearing amount was 11,120,500 yuan. The amount delivered at the Exchange was only 6,422,500 yuan. The delivery quantity did not increase, but it was rumored that the number of private deliveries outside the market by various brokers was very large. In these troubled times, it is expected that spot goods would continue to flow out. The highest September futures prices were at the beginning of July 2-8, and the lowest was on September 24, the last day. The difference between the two was less than 4 yuan for the highest and less than 2 yuan for the lowest, and the stimulation from the environment became more and more intense. Initially, the market price rose sharply after the resolution in Guangdong. Subsequently, the issue in Guangxi eased the tension, and this cycle repeated itself. The market price hovered for a long period of time. After the peaceful resolution of the Guangxi issue, there were rumors of the Reorganization Public Bonds rising again, coupled with the serious smuggling in North China. Then the Chengdu incident occurred, followed by unfortunate accidents in Beihai and Hankou. Although there were no changes in the market, it ultimately lacked the strength to rise. After the Hong Kong incident occurred on September 23, which happened to be the last day of trading for September futures, people were shaken by this event. Large investors exited, and spot goods flowed out, and the market situation began to turn bearish. The clearing amounts and total transaction numbers are listed separately below (unit:</p>

<p>Yesterday in the overseas silk market, Yokohama rose slightly, New York was quiet, and Lyon was even more difficult to approach due to the passage of the French currency bill and the devaluation of the French franc. Ewo traded slightly in 3A grade and 83 uniformity 16.18 strands, and the price was relatively stable. There were only a few sales in the domestic silk market, and prices were slightly weak.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Precious Eyebrow and Pearl Tea Sales to Europe Become Active <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the foreign firms' green tea market was quite lively. The sales of Precious Eyebrow and Pearl Tea from the Luzhuang and Shui roads to Europe suddenly became smooth. Concord, Ewo, Tongfu, Baochang, and other firms purchased a lot. The total transactions of green tea in the city reached more than 2,000 cases. The top-grade Precious Eyebrow from each of the Tunxi firms opened at 126 yuan, and the top-grade Pearl Tea from Pingshui opened at 62 yuan. However, the market prices of medium and low-grade goods still tended to fall due to the relatively large amount of inventory. The market situation still showed a rising and falling pattern. The large quantities of Qimen black tea purchased by the Jinlong Foreign Firm have all been priced, and there are also scattered transactions.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Warehouses and Lai Guild, the green tea market last week had little development due to the holiday period in Morocco. However, various foreign firms sent out a considerable number of sales telegrams over the weekend. Yesterday, the market situation turned active. Ewo received a reply from the buyer and purchased 800 cases of Precious Eyebrow from various routes, with the prices being 46 yuan for Local Precious, 58 yuan for Anhui Precious, and 66 to 68 yuan for Tunxi Wuyuan Precious, and two batches of Pingshui Pearl Tea purchased before and after, totaling approximately 2,000 cases, at prices of 53 yuan to 54 jiao. Concord purchased 800 cases of Xiumei, with prices ranging from 18 to 23 yuan. There are also considerable negotiations on Pingshui Pearl Tea and Precious Eyebrow on the market, and there is hope for transactions in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Sugar Market: Transactions of Five Rams Coarse White Sugar Increase; A Total of 1,582 Bags Were Sold <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was tighter due to news of the Ho Lan market closing. As a result, the Cantonese coarse white sugar auction sales were very smooth, and there was a shortage of supply. The Guild's clearing prices were 21.6 jiao for spot coarse granulated white sugar, up 1 jiao, and 6.5 yuan for re-export. Dongbai sugar also tightened, rising by 1 jiao to 5 fen, 21.4 jiao for spot No. 4, 6.5 yuan for re-export, 21.15 jiao for spot No. 8, 6.3 yuan for re-export, and 20.95 jiao for spot No. 9, 5.9 yuan for re-export. There were no changes in the local factory's cotton white sugar.</p>
<p>The Joint Company held its first auction of Cantonese sugar for this week yesterday. The total quota was 15,811 bags. The bidding price remained the same, and the interest from the firms suddenly increased, and the supply was insufficient for distribution. All the sugar was sold, including 5,913 bags of Shunde Factory's Five Rams coarse white sugar at 21.4 jiao, 4,250 bags of Shixin Factory's 父 at 21.2 jiao, and 3,425 bags of Quxi Factory's sugar at 21 yuan, and another 579 bags at 20.7 jiao, and another 1,644 bags of medium granulated white sugar at 19.3 jiao. Subsequently, prices increased, probably because Dutch coarse white sugar also showed signs of rebounding.</p>

<p>— (Reclining Buddha)</p>
<p>Chinese people, after all, do not seek deep understanding and are content with the status quo. They fundamentally do not understand where Heaven is, what abilities Heaven possesses, and what relationship exists between Heaven and humanity. Yet, they regard Heaven as the master of destiny, the conductor of life, with sayings like "relying on Heaven for food," "Heaven's mandate is unchangeable," entrusting everything to Heaven, consigning everything to Heaven, attributing everything to Heaven. I truly do not understand why the Chinese people's belief in Heaven is so resolute?</p>
<p>In fact, even if we acknowledge the existence of Heaven, there is absolutely no such thing as a Heavenly mandate; what exists is only "Heavenly evolution." Without a Heavenly mandate, Heaven will never turn the poor and lowly into the rich and noble, nor the rich and noble into the poor and lowly. It will not doom the ambitious to fall, nor compel the complacent to advance. Only Heavenly evolution deserves considerable attention, because everything human is inescapable from the principles of Heavenly evolution. What are the principles of Heavenly evolution? They are survival of the fittest, the superiority of the strong and the elimination of the weak. Therefore, under natural evolution, you are only allowed to take the path of striving and advancing, and not allowed to be content with ease and comfort. Otherwise, you will undoubtedly be eliminated.</p>
<p>Therefore, relying on a Heavenly mandate is decadence for an individual, and relying on a Heavenly mandate is national ruin for a majority. Only by believing in Heavenly evolution can one be progressive and save the nation. Only a Heavenly mandate can destroy Heavenly evolution, while Heavenly evolution can restrain a Heavenly mandate.</p>
<p>Before us lie these two paths – a Heavenly mandate and Heavenly evolution. Should not everyone carefully consider their choice?</p>
<h3 id="e190">Biography of a Rotten-Haired Fellow <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>Those who live in or have visited Hangzhou must be very familiar with the term "Rotten-Haired Fellow." However, the Rotten-Haired Fellow described here is a "Decidedly Foreigner," whose extraordinary conduct merits a biography. "Rotten-Haired Fellow" is a transliteration of "Laumel." Generally, those who have been highly culturally invaded always forget their ancestors and regard foreign countries as being all-powerful. Thus, they simply "foreignize" even their own names to show their conversion to Westernization. Laumel is one such example, and his original Chinese name has been obscured as a result.</p>
<p>The Rotten-Haired Fellow was originally a country bumpkin from the interior. After receiving a Western baptism in a treaty port, he returned home in glory and immediately looked down upon the countryside as being backward, so he moved into the city. Although the city was hundreds of times better than the countryside, the Rotten-Haired Fellow still lamented not having a Western-style house to live in. Fortunately, at this time, he had not yet seen a flush toilet!</p>
<p>When the Rotten-Haired Fellow spoke, he often interspersed it with gibberish. This, rather than showing his erudition, was simply a habit. For example, if he was in a room and someone knocked on the door, he would not ask "Who is it?" but say "Goods"; instead of saying "Please come in," he would say "Keming." When he went to visit someone and inquired outside, he would not say "Hey," but would definitely say "Xia Luo." He liked to use gibberish in this way.</p>
<p>The Rotten-Haired Fellow once invested a large sum of money and traveled to the West for more than a year. Having eaten Western bread, he was naturally different from the common people. When someone invited him to be a director, after taking office, he lectured all his colleagues extensively about England and France. He also made it one of his major policy directions to have all the toilets uniformly renovated into flush toilets to enhance the appearance!</p>
<p>The Rotten-Haired Fellow treated his colleagues like a foreign master treats his servants, nitpicking and often scolding them. People all called him a "Decidedly Foreigner" (Sub-foreigner), because he could not utter three sentences without mentioning England or America.</p>
<p>Encomium: "What is the Rotten-Haired Fellow like? A minor foreigner, his skills stop here!"</p>
<h3 id="e191">Hu Die's Confession <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Manzi</p>
<p>After reading Hu Die's announcements in the Shen and Xin newspapers, I felt that she had recognized that the film industry must be 'committed to for life'. The day before yesterday, I obtained a complimentary ticket from a friend to see her starring in "Women's Rights" at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater. I wanted to understand whether her performance, after half a year away from the limelight, was improved or regressed. From beginning to end, I was not tired, even though it was past midnight and nearing dawn, the golden hour of slumber. This is because she performed in almost twenty out of the thirty-plus scenes of "Women's Rights", truly earning the title of lead actress. Moreover, transitioning between various roles such as a university student, a young woman, a bank clerk, a female teacher, and a female worker, each position should have different postures, emotions, and consciousness, fully embodied in every word and action, to create a distinction. In each change of position, she has different ways of stimulating her, and she should have different responses; and the result of different responses, but the same feeling, this kind of story, although not new, but the performance is very difficult. But she handled it very easily, after all, she is an experienced veteran.</p>
<p>The next day, my friend introduced me to the Star Film Company in Chulin Bridge, where she happened to be starring in "Eternal Smile". Indeed, she is the eternal smile, her amiability fully manifested in a dimple. On the filming set, she performs earnestly, even though the time is very long, due to the repeated "NGs" of the supporting actors, wasting a lot of time, and even the onlookers are somewhat anxious and bored, but after the "OK", she is still very happy to chat with us. She asked if I had seen "Women's Rights"? I said: I have seen it, she smiled and said, if you came to see our work during the production of "Women's Rights", I'm afraid you wouldn't have lasted five minutes, because it was the hottest part of summer, but we've gotten used to it.</p>
<p>As I was leaving her and walking out of the filming set, I said to my friend that I was convinced that Hu Die had recognized the greatness of film, and that she and Song Jiayu in Women's Rights, have the same ambition. Especially commendable is that she is in a more comfortable situation than Song Jiayu, and is absolutely unwilling to "stop the progress of her career for the sake of the union of the two sexes." We hope that "Women's Rights" is her confession.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Random Talks About Goldfish <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Mr. Xin Yu Tang Yan Yi (a mathematics professor at Jiaotong University, with a master's degree from the United States) has visited many times and does not disdain to associate with inferiors. Mr. Tang has recently become fond of ornamental fish. At his residence on Avenue Petain in West Shanghai, he has six sand tanks displaying various precious goldfish. Yesterday, he and his wife drove to Caohejing to specifically look for multicolored pearl goldfish and blue telescope goldfish. Mr. Tang has new business in Beiping, and entrusted someone to carry more than ten fine specimens on his return journey, all of which are rare in the south. Some of his friends also happily sought famous breeds from him, so he provided them nearby. Continuing to talk about the treatment of aquatic organisms, I was instructed on academic principles and benefited greatly. I was also told to recommend to audit a certain university. I lost my schooling at a young age and made mistakes when I grew up. In the way of fish, I have gained access to the door. I have received inquiries from all over the country from those who share the same hobby. I only want to study it again, but it is really difficult to answer fundamentally. At night, I feel guilty and ashamed. The sage said, "Learn after being troubled." Now that I can get this good opportunity, I should strive to improve and comfort the general expectations of teachers and friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Dongjun, the director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, often pays unannounced visits to his jurisdiction in plain clothes. Three times last month he came to "Fish Swim Heaven". While admiring the fish, he inquired about the method of distinguishing male and female fish. I told him that the male fish looks at the fish's body, and the old fish touches the fish's abdomen. The greater the distance between the abdomen and the tail, the more masculine it is; the shorter it is, the more feminine it is. However, this method is sometimes not accurate, because the abdomen of male fish is also swollen. The method of touching is more appropriate. When picking up the fish, touch the fish's abdomen with your fingers. The female fish is soft, because the eggs are stored. (Although the eggs in the fish's abdomen are frequently scattered between spring and summer, they still cannot be completely scattered, so the difference between male and female is most obvious in spring and summer, and slightly worse in autumn and winter.) The scales of male fish are hard and not slightly different. Director Cai tried it by hand, laughed loudly and left. He once asked if he could prepare one or two red ones in the mansion to pass the leisure time after work. The answer was: This fish is too difficult to raise, and there is no such leisure. According to research, the female fish are more prosperous than the male, accounting for about six to four. I also asked Professor Tang. Tang said, this is the nature of the water, and it is difficult to answer without actually studying aquaculture. There is no shortage of experts in the country, and you should ask them. (Ji Ren's postscript: Guansheng's Fish Capital, I have resigned and left, and I am selling my own "Purple Micro Goldfish Factory". The address is also in Caohejing Town. Please send it to Yanling Jixia, Caohejing, if you are friendly.)</p>

<h3 id="e193">Private Ode to Paradise <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Chong</p>
<p>Prerequisites for Being an Immortal</p>
<p>The following passage, although similar to playful writing and slightly humorous, clearly reveals the truth and contains profound principles. For example, the mockery of Chunyu's son-in-law, the jesting of Dongfang's courtier, and the humorous insertions of Liu Ma Zi (Jing Ting) the comedian. The benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom, each possessing satirical effects and far-reaching implications. The so-called laughing and scolding, arguing and advising, humorous words may even contain considerable sorrow and be filled with infinite grief, forged and organized by many bitter tears. It is not necessarily about sophistry to please, humor to delight, and must not be regarded as frivolous talk about romance, dental wit, just for giggles, without significance.</p>
<p>Previous people often compared Suzhou and Hangzhou to heaven. Now, Shanghai has surpassed them. The prosperity of the foreign concessions is simply hundreds of times that of Suzhou and Hangzhou. Roughly speaking, Shanghai can undoubtedly be called today's paradise. Since Shanghai is paradise, then we, the people living in paradise, needless to say, are all living gods, at the very least, no less than land immortals. Speaking of our living conditions in paradise, they are actually no less than those of gods. For example, immortals like to live in tall buildings, we have skyscrapers of twenty-odd floors to live in; gods can ride clouds and mist, traveling with the wind—we also have airplanes to sit on, gods have flowers that never fade in the four seasons and evergreens in the eight festivals—and we now have foreign varieties of rare flowers all year round, gods can transport fresh fruits from thousands of miles away and out of season—and we can now use airplanes and cold storage to do the same, and they come from across the ocean, even rarer and more valuable than theirs. Furthermore, the high-speed flight of trains and cars, isn't that the god's ability to shrink the ground? Wireless radio and photography, aren't those the gods' clairvoyance and keen hearing? Motorcycles and bicycles, aren't those the gods' Wind and Fire Wheels? Ships on the water and submarines under the water, aren't those water escape techniques? Walking at will in the basement, isn't that earth escape? (Although Shanghai does not yet have great projects such as underground trains like New York, it will definitely be possible to imitate them in the near future, which will be even more like earth escape,) the installation of central heating in cold weather and air conditioning in hot weather can change the climate, so the winter clothes and summer furs flaunted by the gods are not surprising at all! Moreover, the material civilization of Shanghai may even exceed that of heaven. Many speculative venues and novel games, I am afraid that the gods will shake their heads and stick out their tongues when they see them, ashamed that they have never experienced them! We actually roam here like immortals, what else is there to be unsatisfied with? However, dare I ask: To what extent is our life as gods in this paradise truly happy? And why do most immortals feel deeply distressed, bored, and complain? Could it be because people are too insatiable, like a beggar wanting to be an emperor, and wanting to be a beggar again after becoming an emperor?</p>
<p>It must be known that there are several grades and types of immortals, and immortals are not necessarily happy! Liu Hai scattering money, Lu Dongbin turning stones into gold, making money in the right way, with daily income, economically well-off, and living comfortably, these friends in the capitalist class, even if they don't become immortals, are still very happy. As for those laborers, such as the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, owing the Heavenly Emperor's betrothal money, anxious day and night, plowing and weaving, just busy repaying debts, and also forcibly separating the couple, only able to cross the magpie bridge to meet once a year, that kind of immortal situation, I am afraid, is not very good? Especially we who have read a few dead books, relying solely on writing to maintain a living, and are called poor scholars by the masses, only getting a meager amount of alfalfa rations and absolutely not沾染ing any golden or silver aura, what fun is there in becoming an immortal in this kind of hard and bitter life! What's more, this paradise of Shanghai is especially built on money, and we who are listed as immortals are ultimately earth immortals and half-immortals with shallow Taoism, and have not learned the practical skills of immortal transcendence, so naturally we should suffer more! Please see: gods can wear "ivy as clothes" and "lotus leaves as skirts", can we? Gods can eat wind and drink dew, whistling in mist and haze, or take white stones as bait, and the essence of the sun and moon as food, and can even eat iron pellets when embarrassed, and drink copper juice when thirsty, can we? Gods can also make the sky their curtain and the earth their seat, pillow on streams and live in caves, sleep against the clouds, and sleep near the latrine, can we? Regarding the three major issues of clothing, food and housing, gods can solve them without spending a penny, which will inevitably become a fatal injury and a piercing pain for us; in addition, the living standards in paradise are particularly high compared to the mortal world, and it is difficult to move an inch without money, and we poor immortals who fill the ranks and have no skills happen to lack money the most, so the fairyland is desolate, the expression is embarrassed, and we feel more sad than all the sentient beings in the human world! From this, we can draw the following conclusion: Shanghai is indeed worthy of being paradise, and we can also be immortals, but the only prerequisite is to fully raise a sum of money before we can live peacefully in the fairyland and receive fragrant flower offerings, otherwise, even if we are omnipotent Great Luo True Immortals, we will only have to sigh at the roof and be at a loss, unless we quickly borrow a finger from Mr. Lu Dongbin! Therefore, the true happy immortals are only limited to rich and noble immortals, otherwise, since they have become immortals, why bother to learn the ability to turn stones into gold?</p>
<p>No wonder recently many immortals are infatuated with the prosperity of paradise, yearning for the happiness of immortals, and yet feeling cold to the bone, lacking the capital to become immortals, with fire in their eyes and ice in their bodies, everything is desirable but not attainable, so their appetite is greatly aroused and their desires are high, and they no longer care about the Qing rules that immortals should abide by, becoming extremely evil and ugly, desperately jumping around, even if they violate the rules and ruin their reputation, they will not hesitate. I therefore think that the phrase "immortal jump" circulating in Shanghai's population is probably derived from this? Hehe!</p>
<p>However, I have to say it again: It is also not easy to be an immortal in paradise. If there is too much money, I am afraid that fierce gods and evil spirits such as "Bi Ma Wen", "Marshal Wen", and "Bull Demon King" will have evil intentions when they see the wealth, and use violence to rob or kidnap, living in fear all day long, as if in prison, and dare not cross the thunder pool easily. Isn't that still very unhappy? Fortunately, Liu Hai and Lu Dongbin's money comes very easily, so it's okay to give up a small portion of the charitable wealth and hire a few fully armed Wei Bodhisattvas and tall and mighty Four Heavenly Kings to protect them and carefully guard the door. Not only can it enhance the spectacle and increase the momentum, but also the security is meticulous and the security is strict, what else to worry about evil stars and fierce Tai Sui coming to "kidnap the God of Wealth"!</p>

<p>Chapter 7: High Brotherly Affection Conceals Weak Sister's Letter, Heavy Poetic Air Prying Shadows Laughs at Cold Needs</p>
<p>He flipped through two or three magazines all at once, and suddenly had a thought. He immediately closed the 閒 door, propped his chin on 頰 underneath, and lowered his eyelids slightly, making a pensive look. Because he hadn't said a word for a long time, Meng Lan casually turned her head and saw him like that, so she asked: Mei, what are you thinking about? You Mei still lowered her head and said: I think Zhang Litian's writing is the most touching. But such a young person with unlimited hopes for the future, why doesn't he say words of encouragement, but instead fills his writing with a sense of decadence? Meng Lan didn't answer the question he raised. Still raising her head slightly, she was thinking. But now she wasn't looking at the landscape painting on the wall but at the white clouds in the sky outside the window. You Mei put down the book, sat back on the original chair, and boldly asked him further, looking at him and said: You've seen a lot of Zhang Li Da's writings, which one do you think is the best? Meng Lan was stared at by his gaze, and didn't dare to look back at her, but smiled slightly. In this smile, he gave You Mei the key, completely opening up the doubts she had been unable to figure out for many days. Then he smiled and said: I think you think every one of his writings is okay, and there's one more thing you would never guess, we are relatives. Meng Lan couldn't help being stunned, and glanced at You Mei and said: What, you are relatives? You Mei said: Yes, he and I are relatives. He and my brother often go back and forth. His old mother is a very kind person, and I go to his house a few times a year. His mother and son depend on each other to live a poor and hard life. But Zhang Li Da is a very artistic person, and the house is tidy and clean. Even the house he lives in was deliberately chosen by him, and it has a bit of antique charm. Meng Lan smiled and said: Who asked you these? You Mei said: You think I'm pretending to be relatives with him, so I'll give a few pieces of evidence to prove I'm not lying. Meng Lan said: Besides selling articles, what else does he do? You Mei said: He teaches at Jinde Middle School nearby. He's in charge of the upper elementary grades two and three, a waste of talent, he's very idle. Meng Lan said: Then he shouldn't be poor. You Mei said: How much do you think you can earn a month teaching? Selling articles is even more limited in royalties. Meng Lan said: Is his full of sorrowful words not for 閒? You Mei said: That's not it. He is an orphan, raised by his mother since childhood. He feels out of touch with the current politics and society. But he is a very peaceful person, and his grievances have nowhere to vent, so he specializes in writing sad love novels. Actually, I know very well that he probably doesn't have a sweetheart yet? Meng Lan smiled and said: You are relatives. After saying these five words, 閒 suddenly stopped talking. You Mei pressed her mouth and said: You are too unreasonable. (80)</p>

<h3 id="e195">General Talk on Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhao Zhang</p>
<p>(Lecture at St. Mary's Girls' School)</p>
<p>The Pathological State of Chinese People</p>
<p>On the road, in public places, hunchbacked, stooped, listless, weak, no one will deny that these are Chinese people. Why are Chinese people so decadent, and why is the Chinese nation so weak? This is a very serious question. Foreigners look down on us Chinese the most. Even the Indians who have already lost their country don't think much of us. They say that China is a sick country, and almost everyone in China has problems. This is such a painful thing.</p>
<p>The Situation of Tuberculosis in China</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the decline of the Chinese nation, among which tuberculosis is one of the biggest reasons. According to experts, one in every twenty-five people in China has tuberculosis, and four thousand out of every 100,000 people have tuberculosis. There are 16 million people with tuberculosis in the country, and 1.6 million people die from tuberculosis every year. On average, twenty-five people die from tuberculosis every ten minutes. This mortality rate is unparalleled in the world. Experts have also statistically found that there are 140,000 people with tuberculosis in Shanghai. Just imagine that so many people with tuberculosis are spreading and spreading every day. I am afraid that in less than two years, we will all become victims.</p>
<p>Stamps Transmit Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Recently, an American magazine contained that most of the staff in the US post office have developed tuberculosis. The news spread and shocked the entire United States. After research by experts, it was found that this disease is completely transmitted by stamps, because most people use sputum to stick stamps, and inevitably there are people with tuberculosis. After the stamps are dry, the tuberculosis bacteria spread. Because there are many letters in the post office, and they breathe the air full of tuberculosis bacteria all day long, they get infected. Tuberculosis is everywhere, which is terrible.</p>
<p>Tigers Killed by Tuberculosis</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, the tiger in the Nanshi Zoo suddenly died. All parties were very surprised. After an autopsy by the Health Bureau, it was found that the tiger had third-stage tuberculosis and died of incurable disease. The reason why the tiger suffered from tuberculosis was because it ate the sputum of tuberculous tourists. Look, the tiger can't defeat tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is also fiercer than a tiger. This problem is really too serious.</p>
<p>The Source and Transmission of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Lack of sleep, unclean diet, dirty housing, lack of exercise, depression, and lack of hygiene habits are all the main causes of tuberculosis. Living, eating, using utensils, and close conversation with patients are all ways of transmitting tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Spitting is Like Throwing a Bomb</p>
<p>The worst habit of Chinese people is spitting everywhere. Because this is a serious problem, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association holds a week of campaigns to stop spitting every year, and has invited doctors to take sputum for testing in the Nanjing Road area. It was found that 30% of them had tuberculosis bacteria. Machine gun bullets can kill people, but spitting everywhere is not the same as throwing machine gun bullets everywhere? In the same way, it can kill people and kill us.</p>
<p>Prevention and Treatment of Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Regular daily exercise and work, sufficient sleep, cleanliness of diet and housing, a happy mood, and isolation and separate meals from patients are all methods of preventing tuberculosis. But unfortunately, when we feel that our appetite is poor, night sweats, coughing up blood, the facts tell us that tuberculosis has already come. However, Chinese people are born with superstitious ideas. When they are sick, they only know how to pray to gods and recite Buddha, but they don't know that praying to gods and reciting Buddha will not only not improve the patient, but will make them heavier every day. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese people die unjustly every year in this way. Therefore, once we find the above symptoms, we should go to the hospital immediately, or ask a doctor to diagnose and treat us. But the most important thing is prevention, because it is dangerous to wait until you are sick before seeking treatment.</p>
<p>Hope Everyone Cooperates to Prevent Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Foreigners often bully us, mainly because we lack the power of unity. We only shrink back and are lazy when things happen. You can see that most people on the road put their hands in their sleeves and tie up their sleeves. This fully shows that our nation only stands by when things happen, and only hesitates when encountering difficulties. We should improve this bad habit. We, regardless of men and women, should join hands, not talk empty words, not sing high-sounding tunes, and hope that everyone has the spirit of a 'tumbler' and the courage and sacrifice of President Sun to revive our declining Chinese nation.</p>
<h3 id="e196">My Humble Opinion on Promoting New Medical and Health in Rural Areas <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Han Zhongying</p>
<p>To revive the countryside, although it requires efforts in all aspects, running rural medical and health care is also an urgent task for the current rural medical and health care: it is indeed a fact recognized by modern health experts, politicians, and important people in society. Because our country is based on agriculture, farmers account for more than 85% of the national population, and rural areas account for more than 90% of the national territory, so in the past, many people said: 'The rural problem is the whole problem of China'; I can also say now; 'The rural medical and health problem is also the whole Chinese medical and health problem'; then, according to the above two points, the importance of rural medical and health care, the relationship between farmers and the country can be seen.</p>
<p>Speaking of the history of rural medical and health care in our country, it is very naive. However, in the past seven or eight years, when public health has been extended to rural areas: a new medical term has been produced, which is the germination period when new medical and health care is promoted to rural areas.</p>
<p>Because farmers live in remote rural areas, new education is difficult to popularize, and most farmers have not received new knowledge and new education. This has created a stubborn brain, and the remaining poison of superstition is deeply rooted in the brain. Once they get sick, they don't know how to seek medical treatment, and there is no scientific new medicine to seek. They don't know how to take care of themselves during illness, and how to deal with it after illness. They completely rely on their long-trained copper muscles and iron bones to resist the disease and fight against the disease demon. If they are not strong enough, when they can't resist and can't fight the disease demon, the power of the bacteria will be greatly expanded, and the disease will worsen. Then the whole family will panic, anxiously holding a full of grief and ghost fetus, waiting for the coming of the god of death. They always think that they have offended the sky, or stopped the god's arrow. So they seek gods and worship Buddha, burn incense and ask for divination. If they are usually strong, or the disease they suffer from is lighter, they will heal once, which is the Buddha's power, the god's grace, and the Bodhisattva's諭. If the disease worsens or even dies, they always say; 'It is destined by heaven, and the fate should be so'; or say; 'Yan Wang呌s him or her death will not be wrong'! As long as you step into the countryside and encounter these things, you will hear these kinds of words. They don't know: the disease is caused by bacteria (microorganisms that can cause disease), and is caused by unhygienic conditions. Under this situation, how many wronged ghosts have been added to the underworld? As a result, the mortality rate has increased, the expenditure on medical expenses, and the decline of business, the reduction of economic productivity, and the creation of a collapsed and irreparable rural area.</p>
<p>Then, the only wonderful way to save the country and survive now: promoting new medical and health care in rural areas is the supreme strategy; the development of new medical and health care undertakings can reduce the mortality rate of diseases, and can promote people's health, prolong people's lives, increase the ability to work and economic productivity, and the improvement of the country's status in the international community is a fact that cannot be denied by ordinary people.</p>
<p>Indeed, new medical and health care has made considerable progress and remarkable achievements in recent years. However, it is often seen or heard that the difficulties encountered by the pioneers of rural medical and health care and the repeated failures have caused a psychological embarrassment to those who have not served in rural areas. Therefore, the author's knowledge is shallow and the writing is rough. Without hesitation, there are the following points, which are published in this newspaper's medical supplement for the reference of comrades who intend to run rural medical and health care: have a definite goal and a preventive plan to jointly seek the progress of rural medical and health care promotion. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e197">Regarding Li Kejia and the Illness of Li Kejia (1) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Duanbai</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The term "Li Kejia" is relatively new and perhaps worth introducing. In the ranks of various infectious disease pathogens, it is a rather late newcomer, originating just twenty years ago, during a time when bacteriology was in decline. Therefore, it holds even more significance for introduction.</p>
<p>Li Kejia is undoubtedly a pathogen. However, within the field of bacteriology, due to its unique and distinct characteristics, it is difficult to categorize it into any existing bacterial system. Therefore, those who identified it as a pathogen, for the sake of temporary classification and to honor the two scholars who sacrificed themselves in initially discovering it, named the genus of this pathogen after the surname of the first scholar, calling it Rickettsia. This was combined with the surname of the second sacrifice, naming it Rickettsia prowaxeki, the pathogen of epidemic typhus, which also serves as a model representative of the Rickettsia genus, Types spezies (Typus).</p>
<p>(II) History</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the European War, epidemic typhus also raged. At that time, many scholars dedicated themselves to exploring the pathogen. After numerous discoveries, one by one they were refuted. Eventually, the first, Ricketts, (possibly Polish! A stateless person at the time)</p>
<p>whose name will perish with the end of human civilization, proving him more noble than so-called national heroes limited to one era. He was a great hero who sacrificed himself in the struggle for human survival against nature. His death was truly heavier than Mount Tai. In 1910, he discovered small bodies (microorganisms) within the tissues of animals infected with epidemic typhus, now known as Li Kejia. Prowazek, based on his life status, was convinced that it was a pathogen and published his research on Mexican typhus (Tabardillo). Not long after, this promising young scholar was infected and succumbed to Li Kejia. He died aspiring to his goal. However, others followed in his footsteps. Prowazek continued Ricketts' research and published his report on the discovery of this pathogen in 1913. However, not long after, he also followed in Ricketts' footsteps and died of epidemic typhus. Rocha Lima continued the work, proving the reproduction of these small bodies in the epithelial cells of the intestinal wall of lice, the vectors of epidemic typhus. From a biological and morphological point of view, they were identical to those discovered by Ricketts and Prowazek. He published in 1916, confirming that these small bodies, which resembled bacteria, were indeed the pathogens of epidemic typhus, based on pathogenicity, biological state, and morphology. Since then, researchers have followed this path to seek similar pathogens in similar diseases, and successful findings have continued to be published. Today, we know that several diseases, previously with unknown pathogens, are caused by Li Kejia, for example,</p>
<p>Rocky Mountain spotted fever Rockv muuntain spot ted fever</p>
<p>Trench fever Febris quintana Wojbynicn</p>
<p>Mexican typhus Taqardillo Brill Diseaso</p>
<p>Manchurian typhus Ma nchau Fleckfider</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(92) Gout (Middle)</p>
<p>If gout becomes chronic, what symptoms appear? Chronic gout causes symptoms such as swollen and deformed joints, tophi, and Heberden's nodes.</p>
<p>What does joint swelling and deformation look like?</p>
<p>The small joints of the patient's fingers and toes show persistent changes, especially in the fingers. Nodular or spindle-shaped thickening occurs at the metacarpophalangeal joints, curving towards the ulnar side.</p>
<p>What are tophi? Tophi are uric acid salt deposits in various parts of the body, most commonly in the auricle and fingers. They are white, pea-sized nodules. They can also occur in the olecranon process, or in the bursae above the knee joint on the extensor side of the elbow. If these masses are punctured with a needle, uric acid and what are called Heberden's nodes will be found.</p>
<p>Heberden's nodes are localized bony thickenings at the distal interphalangeal joints of the second and third fingers or toes. They are also unique to gout patients.</p>
<p>What diseases are concurrent with gout?</p>
<p>Uric acid stones, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and arteriosclerosis often occur.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Investigation Report on the Health Conditions of Xiaoshi, Zhejiang (2) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>(VI) Shops and Public Places</p>
<p>The entire town of Xiaoshi only has three pawnshops for civilians (originally there were four, but due to the impact of the rural collapse, one closed down this year, and the remaining three are also struggling), eight money shops, only four of which are still open. The Bank of China occupies the highest authority in the town's financial sector. There are three bookstores, two printing shops, and no fewer than two thousand four hundred other businesses, half of which have capital exceeding ten thousand yuan. However, due to the surge in the economic recession, the town is close to the collapsing countryside, and commerce is declining more rapidly. All industries are already at the end of their rope, especially small businesses. Only the rice industry is doing well, not diminishing despite the decline of other markets. This year, the number of rural goods stores has increased slightly, reaching over thirty. Originally, the market in Xiaoshi was very prosperous, once known as "Little Shanghai." Since the silk and tea industries plummeted, the town, which thrived on three industries, now relies only on the rice industry to barely survive.</p>
<p>There are about ten hotels in the entire town. The First Hotel on Ganhe Street has relatively complete facilities and pays attention to hygiene and cleanliness. The others either lack light or are unhygienic, truly a manifestation of the town's immature understanding of hygiene. Only three restaurants remain open. There are many dim sum shops, the most famous being Jiang Shunxing, which has two locations in the north and south markets. The most famous tea and pastry shops are Tian Yixing and Chen Xinyuan, whose shortbread and mooncakes are renowned. There is also a Shaoxing branch tea and pastry shop, whose Shaoxing cakes and pastries are quite popular with the locals, so business is still thriving. There are three large-scale teahouses, the most hygienic being Dafugui, which has good light and air and relatively complete facilities. The others, numbering no fewer than two hundred, mostly have insufficient air and are unhygienic. The famous old "Yiyuan" is where the local gentry drink tea, and the gentry of Xiaoshi go there every day. "Tongfuyuan" is a rest area for the education community, and "Ruyige" is a gathering place for opium addicts. There is only one bathhouse in the entire town, and business is not thriving. The sanitary facilities are excellent, but it has been losing money for years and is about to be unsustainable, a reflection of the people of Xiaodi's lack of attention to bathing, which is a manifestation of immature hygiene knowledge. Even wealthy families do not have special bathhouses, let alone others?</p>
<p>The streets in the town are not wide. People used to only use two-person sedan chairs, but now there are bicycles and rickshaws that have just started to be trialed. Bicycles are only used for recreation. The post office started using bicycles to deliver express mail in mid-June.</p>

<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The Success of National Medical and Pharmaceutical Control How is the Health Protection of the Chinese People?</p>
<p>Other cities that have successfully implemented this project include Rochester, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Roseville, Memphis, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Newark, Norfolk, Oklahoma, San Antonio, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>In North Carolina and Alabama, large-scale provincial insurance programs are underway, and similar programs will be established in Boston and other cities by the end of this year. However, membership is limited to groups and requires a minimum of ten people joining simultaneously. Furthermore, only employed individuals are eligible to join at the time of enrollment.</p>
<p>The New York Hospital Service Insurance Company is currently only willing to accept fifty new members per week.</p>
<p>A 57-year-old man in New York strongly opposed joining when he was first encouraged to do so. However, three weeks after joining, he was admitted to the hospital with severe pneumonia. Upon recovering and being discharged, the hospital bill was only $2.60. Another unemployed member suffered a severe fall and was admitted to the hospital. After X-ray and medication treatment, he was discharged after a week of hospitalization, without paying a penny. Thank-you letters from other members who received free medical treatment due to illness have piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>According to Huikang, despite the development of sports and the progress of public health among the American people, the annual medical expenses amount to 3.6 billion yuan, averaging 30 yuan per person. The cost of medical care is not considered low, but the people benefit from medical security and improved national health, which contributes greatly to various social construction projects. The nation's productivity also increases as a result, and its prosperity is by no means accidental. Furthermore, it can be said that all progress in society and the nation is based on the development of medicine, which is not merely a passive charitable cause, but a noble construction project and a necessity for the masses. I traveled to Europe several years ago and was filled with admiration and envy at the development of medical affairs and the improvement of national health in various countries. The fundamental reason is the success of medical control and adjustment methods. For example, Germany already has 20 million people enrolled in health insurance. If each person pays 5 marks per month, that amounts to 1.2 billion marks per year for medical and construction expenses. According to the 1930 statistics of the United States, the total annual medical expenses reached 3.6 billion yuan, averaging 30 yuan per person per year. From this, it can be seen that medicine is an economic construction, gathering the economic strength of the masses to protect their health and promote the construction of medical affairs, and its control and adjustment center, namely disease insurance agencies, or health and health insurance agencies.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3 id="e202">Abyssinia's Representative Allowed to Continue Attending <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>According to a recent Geneva dispatch, the Credentials Committee of the League of Nations has decided that the Abyssinian delegation may continue to attend and enjoy the rights of a member state. Therefore, it is generally believed that Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations is likely unavoidable. When the Abyssinian representative went to Geneva to attend the League of Nations meeting, the League of Nations felt extremely difficult to deal with this matter, and it was quite difficult to please both sides. Now the Credentials Committee of the League of Nations has decided that the Abyssinian delegation can continue to attend, which is not only a relief for Abyssinia, but also a relief for the League of Nations. This is one of the most satisfactory things the League of Nations has done recently.</p>
<p>Suppose the League of Nations does not allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend this time, where will the prestige of the League of Nations be? And the opening of the League of Nations conference is equivalent to not opening, because the League of Nations has not already resolved that Italy is an aggressor? Hasn't the League of Nations already implemented economic sanctions against Italy? Hasn't the League of Nations already denied the occupation of other countries' territories by force? Now the League of Nations has hardly cancelled the economic sanctions against Italy, but the resolution that Italy is an aggressor and denies the occupation of other countries' territories by force has not been revoked, then although Abyssinia is in fact equal to being lost, the name of Abyssinia still exists, on what basis should the League of Nations not allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend?</p>
<p>Suppose the League of Nations allows the Abyssinian delegation to attend this time, Italy will definitely express extreme anger, which is also expected by the League of Nations, isn't it? But why is the League of Nations able to uphold justice, be willing to offend Italy, which is powerful and has great power, and assist Abyssinia, which exists in name but not in reality? I think there must be some reasons for this. The first is that if the League of Nations considers Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations this time and does not allow the Abyssinian representative to attend, not only will the face of the League of Nations be lost, but Italy, which swallows up the clouds and dreams, will not put the League of Nations in its eyes, and it will be even more difficult to deal with Italy in the future. It is better to save some face and resolutely decide that the Abyssinian delegation can continue to attend the League of Nations, this is the first meaning.</p>
<p>It is heard that the committee has convened several meetings, and in addition to the above decision, it has also resolved that the legality of the Abyssinian delegation's credentials shall not be requested to be determined by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, because the Abyssinian representative has already been allowed to attend the conference temporarily, which is enough to make the problem more complicated. In addition, the Abyssinian delegation cannot but make reservations on certain reasons stated in the report of the Credentials Examination Committee, because these reasons are in fact in conflict with the principle of non-recognition of occupation of land by force. If we look at these two points, the League of Nations' decision to allow the Abyssinian representative to attend the conference is still a tactic, one is to "attend the conference temporarily," and the other is that certain reasons stated conflict with the principle of non-recognition of occupation of land by force. What kind of reasons are the so-called certain reasons? It is difficult to know, but since it conflicts with the principle of occupation of land by force, then certain reasons are not very beneficial to Abyssinia, which can also be imagined. Judging from these two points, Abyssinia's attending representative is only temporary, so Mussolini in Italy calmly deals with the environment without immediately withdrawing from the League of Nations, which also makes sense.</p>

<p>Chen Yishi, a waiter at the ×× Hotel, lived in a building with his companion Yang Tianhua. Chen Yishi was a lean man in his late twenties.

<p>In late September in Jiangnan, early autumn had already soothed people with a cool, soft breeze. But he was still wearing that thin white uniform. This was our second meeting. In our first meeting, we lightly skimmed over casual conversation.</p>
<p>He and I had once worked together in a Portuguese (we mostly called the Portuguese "salty shrimp props") Western restaurant in Hong Kong. I remembered that whenever he ran out of money, an interesting impression would appear before my eyes—</p>
<p>"Jesus loves me, I love—" He opened his hands, seeming to feel that everything was hopeless, and then, he raised his head and sang.</p>
<p>"Alas, Father in Heaven—" What followed was complaining about his own extravagance and regretting that his hard-earned money had been wasted on improper uses.</p>
<p>"Come to my place to hang out," he said haltingly, while pulling down the bottom of his uniform with both hands.</p>
<p>We walked silently along North Sichuan Road for a long stretch. In late mid-September, we had an unforgettable and painful day, but people had forgotten. "Mooncakes" displayed in the windows of food stores easily attracted the attention of some pedestrians.</p>
<p>"Maybe celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival will alleviate a little of our nation's sorrow," I couldn't think of appropriate words to express my feelings. I spoke so clumsily, so ineptly.</p>
<p>"A consumptive ghost singing drum lyrics—" He glared at me, his lips slightly moving. The next sentence, "Making merry when death is imminent," seemed to be tacitly understood.</p>
<p>I was bewildered. Every time I walked along North Sichuan Road, my heart would sink. Because I couldn't fully know to which owner the space of this so-called "Mysterious Street" belonged.</p>
<p>Turning into a narrow alley off East Wuchang Road, another world seemed to unfold here— the air was foul: the stench of urine and feces and the sickening atmosphere evaporating from piles of garbage permeated every corner or drain. The various enticing shouts of the peddlers, mixed with the clamorous noises of uneducated women and children. There was also a small school that had evolved from a private school, from which a burst of singing was heard from time to time. A hoarse voice, outstanding and surpassing all others, shouted very shrilly and very clearly: "Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!"</p>
<p>Chen Yishi's residence was behind that school, in a dark room with poor light. First, he introduced me to his roommate, and I shifted my gaze to the face of the newly acquainted.</p>
<p>"This is Mr. Yang Tianhua."</p>
<p>He gestured towards me with his right hand.</p>
<p>We nodded to each other. I examined his well-proportioned body and a face that was not unpleasant. Then, I turned to Chen Yishi,</p>
<p>"How has life been?"</p>
<p>"Us, what is there to talk about?" Chen Yishi said faintly.</p>
<p>"We are living day by day in the dungeon," Yang Tianhua blurted out.</p>
<p>"Alas, Father in Heaven—" Chen Yishi started singing listlessly, in a tone like singing "Xipi" (a type of Cantonese opera).</p>
<p>"Father in Heaven, screw your Father in Heaven."</p>
<p>Yang Tianhua cursed in annoyance.</p>
<p>I didn't understand why my old friend hadn't changed his bad temper. It was a very embarrassing habit.</p>
<p>Chen Yishi recounted his life after our separation. He pulled down the bottom of his uniform with his hands, speaking. He spoke very slowly, as if with great effort. Obviously, he was gathering all abstract words to avoid recounting the misfortunes of reality.</p>
<p>"Ah Yang is right, we are living day by day in the dungeon…"</p>
<p>However, he neglected to mention the reasons for all the economic downturns, only sighing as if with a sense of it all:</p>
<p>"Fate is not as good as others, so one is naturally inferior."</p>
<p>That was wrong. I never agreed with their claim. What I regretted most was that they entrusted the power to control the ups and downs of life to "fate." In fact, our society has a close relationship with life. Internal and external troubles have caused society to fall into a quagmire of unease, and indirectly affected our lives, so it presents a dim grayness.</p>
<p>We continued talking for a long time. Finally, Chen Yishi concluded:</p>
<p>"In the final analysis, life is built on money. We lack money, so our lives are withered and painful."</p>
<p>What surprised me was that this time Yang Tianhua also sympathized with Chen Yishi's words, "What is most difficult for us to solve is the problem of money, yes, money!…" Yang Tianhua seemed to think that his roommate's theory was very adequate, and a look of triumph flowed between his eyebrows when he spoke.</p>
<p>"If someone gave you money and taught you to be a traitor, would you go?"</p>
<p>I couldn't think of any more ruthless and straightforward words to persuade them.</p>

<p>— Yun Hai</p>
<p>The people passed the fifth day in extreme anxiety.</p>
<p>Every day, this group waited from sunrise until the sun gave them an insulting sneer and then slipped away behind the western hills, always treading the seashore with uneasy minds. As they gazed at the vast expanse of the sea, at those places they knew so well, when they were lost in thought, they couldn't help but be reminded by one of their companions:</p>
<p>"Why isn't there any news yet?"</p>
<p>Then, the old wrinkles on their foreheads would furrow, and they would walk a few steps with worry and fatigue.</p>
<p>Their brows knitted tightly, each heart calculating that news, that news that was like a life-or-death verdict—either struggling against the waves, or, more unfortunately, lingering at home waiting to die. For a moment, they thought of that glimmer of hope: anyway, taking away one or two from among seven or eight, maybe fate wouldn't touch them; however—</p>
<p>"It should be our turn, so why is it still silent?"</p>
<p>That was still watching the sky: watching the changing clouds in the sky to get through the days, letting hunger devour them.</p>
<p>This day, the weather was not good, and a black cloud drifted from afar. The entire sky seemed to be pressed down as heavy as lead, and the people were squeezed as if they were about to explode. On this side, five people were sitting watching the sky, but Old Five was walking back and forth angrily, having just severed everyone's emotions in a dissatisfactory conversation. Therefore, the post seemed particularly dull and unbearably uncomfortable.</p>
<p>After a while, Old Three jumped up violently, hopping madly:</p>
<p>"I can't take it anymore, I can't take it anymore! Even if you want me to stop watching the water, you have to give me a message earlier so that people can think of a way out. Damn it, that old tortoise, eating ash old man!"</p>
<p>"Even if you stop, as long as there are boats, you won't starve to death like this even if you set up a ferry in the provincial capital! Damn it, rely on you?"</p>
<p>This young and strong lad even spat heavily on the ground. Eighth Brother, this particularly casual fellow, his casual nature, was even more infuriating.</p>
<p>"There's still no despair, why is everyone in such a hurry? Third Brother, it's not you I'm afraid of, it's me...!"</p>
<p>You!</p>
<p>Old Three didn't care about anything and punched Eighth Brother on the forehead. Thus, the people passed this day in吵嚷.</p>
<p>The next day, people were still so muddled, either this family beating his wife, or that family taking it out on the children. People were anxiously waiting for the news, but there wasn't even a shadow of it.</p>
<p>In the evening, a surprising piece of news finally pricked everyone awake. The news, Old Three knew it earliest, according to him, was: Boat boss Li Laofu's father hanged himself at home.</p>

<p>Chinese and Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Xiaoxiang Asks About Illness"</p>
<p>The vast twilight gradually turns yellow. The rustling breeze and fine rain are dense. Dim Xiaoxiang sounds lonely. The desolate thin bamboo shadows sink. Yi Hong's young master is a passionate seed. He thought of the melancholy and sickly person. He put on his raincoat and hat. Holding the lamp, he hurried to the garden. He had already arrived at Xiaoxiang Pavilion. The girl was, about to finish her poem when she put down her pen. The maidservant suddenly reported that the second master had arrived. Seeing him, today's dress is not like the past. Brother Bao, why are you learning from the fisherman? The young master heard the words and hurriedly greeted him. Is my sister's body safe? Take medicine, eat more, and don't write poetry recently. I am always worried. Therefore, I came to inquire about the situation in the rain. If my sister loves this outfit. I will send you a set in a few days. Pin Qing replied, why do you need this? The image of a fisherman is actually nameless. The words came out of her mouth. Secretly thinking. Fishermen and fisherwomen should not be said. Peach blossom face flushed with shyness, difficult to hide. Silently lowered her head and did not speak. One is, unintentionally said the wrong words, one is, not open to love, how can you know the feelings. A dream of the Red Chamber is full of changes. Briefly describe, that, the section of Xiaoxiang asking about the illness. I hate the old man under the moon not holding the thread of love. Therefore, medicine is always ineffective, in vain, a piece of heart for both parties.</p>

<p>Lin Ji (1220) 9:05 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Peony"</p>
<p>The peony is unique in the flower kingdom. At that time, the green leaves and red flowers decorated the scenery. Wealth and nobility are uniquely marked as a rare species. Ranked as the leader of the group of flowers. The flower god's February flower evening. The delicate face is unusually kind. I remember. The Qing Dynasty harshly demanded literary prisons. That poem also claimed to be king. Suddenly set off a boundless disaster. How many scholars died for this. Poor, after death, they still have to expose the corpse. Do not teach the white bones to be buried in the ruins. Now the national affairs are in chaos. Who will remember the literary heroes of the past? Wu Meicun, indulged in poetry. Crown with anger for the beauty of makeup. Later, Prince Gui of Yunnan bought it for a thousand gold. Did not allow the poem to be deleted and hidden. Therefore, the昏君 of the Qing Dynasty advocated the great prison. A paper circulation literary prison. How many good gentlemen were implicated. Pity him that his bones were not buried. Scattered in the wilderness in the chaotic post. Peony poetry. It is truly sad. That barbarian. Showed ferocity. Actually lost all the literati. The heroes of Yunnan and Guizhou rebelled against the Qing Dynasty. Also because of that, unbearable cruelty and poisonous heart. Pity, the words and poems of the character 　. Suddenly became a chapter of blood and tears for thousands of years. Purple peony. Especially fragrant. Green leaves decorate the beauty. March flowers are the first. The fairy flower kingdom should be unique as king. Quiet and quiet, good fragrance. two</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenyu's Righteous Demon Biography</p>
<p>Yuanchang (1120) 0:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening: "Mid-Autumn Festival Difficult Moon" (Mimi Collection No.) Year after year, the spring and autumn pass. The sun and moon pass like flowing water. Last year's autumn moon is still in sight. This year's August has arrived again. Thinking of today, the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth of the month. Only seeing, a round of bright moon shining on the tall building. The clouds are light, the moon is round, and the charm is frequently added. I can't hate it, learning from Emperor Ming to travel in the moon. Moon, ah. I see you, today's moon looks different from the past. I see you, the desolate moonlight is all taken away. I see you, the beautiful moon is constantly laughing. I see you, because every family is celebrating the moon. I see you, although the moon is clear and bright as a mirror. I see you, the moonlight is difficult to solve people's worries. You can understand, several families happily enjoy the moon together. Several families are desolate facing the moon. Several families see the moon with sad faces. Several families love the moon and go out to play. Several families are, husband and wife spend their honeymoon together. Several families are, the sun and moon are east and west, each plotting. Several families are, gathering under the moon to open a feast. Several families are, running around everywhere for years. Several families are, happy and carefree, inviting the full moon. Several families are, upside down day and night, not free. Several families are like the Mid-Autumn Moon. Several families are like the crescent moon hook. I think, the round moon will inevitably be missing in the end. That is, the crescent moon is still afraid of the clouds coming to imprison. How can the world compare to the moon in the sky? In the end, the moon in the mirror is always floating. The moon is missing and there is still a day for reunion. How can people die and return like the moon? The moon is missing and the moon is round year after year. How can life be as long as the moon? How can you live with the moon for thousands of years?</p>
