<h3>英內閣的難關</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>在鮑爾溫領導之下的英國保守黨內閣現在正因爲遭遇着空前的種種難關而有杌隍不安之象所謂空前的種種難關是可以分做對外對內兩方面來講的</p>
<p>對外的難關第一是對意問題英意兩國在東菲和地中海的爭霸是無時或已的意相墨索里尼在侵阿意軍佔領阿京之後就宣佈阿比西尼亞是意國的領屬從而要求英國撤退它駐在阿國的軍隊無形中把它在阿國的利益一筆抹煞同時墨索里尼的雄心未已對於阿爾巴尼亞的佔領和地中海的霸權還是刻刻不能忘懷這使英國在東菲和地中海的霸權感受到無上的威脅其次是對德問題保守黨的外交政策對德是一向很優容的但德國進兵萊茵區域一事却給以萊茵爲國防綫的英國以很嚴重的威脅最近它雖已提出問題表責問德國但德國却不但遲遲不覆反提出了恢復舊殖民地的要求在德國的舊殖民地中英國獲得最多所以這個要求的提出大有使英國難以再事容忍之戚最後是國聯的改組問題鮑爾溫因爲國聯對意制裁失效而欲改組國聯可是國聯在事實上雖不能制止侵略者的侵略但在一般人看來它還是不失爲一個牽制侵略者的工具同時在英國目前的外交上還需要法國的帮助而法國則正要維護國聯這未免使鮑爾溫有左右爲難之勢了</p>
<p>對內的難關第一當數到殖民地的反英運動巴勒斯坦的猶太人和阿拉伯人自相仇殺的行動現已一變而爲阿拉伯人反抗英國的解放運動阿拉伯民族最高委員會早就决議罷工罷市以及拒付一切捐稅以反抗英國的統治和高壓雖然英國的重兵和飛機迄今還在那裹彈壓可是阿拉伯人的反英解放運動不獨未曾消滅反而日益高漲其次是預算案內容的洩漏鮑爾溫內閣爲擴張軍備起見不得不加重捐稅增加人民的負擔當上月下旬英下院通過預算案時鮑氏已受盡了反政府派的攻擊加重的捐稅項目中包含所得稅和茶稅在下院沒有通過以前加稅的消息已經傳出遂致有人利用時機投機取利日昨殖民大臣湯姆斯雖因涉有洩漏這消息的嫌疑而提出辭職但這終不免有玷鮑內閣的官箴的</p>
<p>現在鮑爾溫內閣大有因不能打開這些難關而將改組的趨勢了但是改組以後要打開這些難關恐怕也不是一件容易的事情吧</p>
<h3>美海軍龐大預算</h3>
<p>兩院聯席會議商妥折衷方案　加緊造艦海軍兵額增至十萬</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　海軍部前於本年二月間、提出一九三六—三七年度預算案、（當自本年七月一日起算）所需經費、共五四九·五九一·〇〇〇美元、較之上屆預算計增加六七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元、業由衆議院參議院先後修正通過、旋因意見未能一致、爰乃提付兩院聯席委員會討論、該委員會頃已商定折衷方案、規定海軍經費爲五二六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元、較之原案雖减少二千餘萬元、仍爲承平時代最龐大之預算案、其用途乃建造驅逐艦十二艘潛水艇六艘、賡續建造他項軍艦共八十四艘、並規定倫敦海軍條約其他各簽字國若果建造主力艦、則羅斯福總統得下令建造主力艦兩艘、此外並主張建造飛機三三三架、而將海軍員額自九三·五〇〇員名、增至一〇〇·〇〇〇員名、此項折衷案、當於下星期之內提付國會表决通過、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英增巡艦噸位　日本提出覆文</h3>
<p>倫敦海約未失效前　此項要求勢難承認</p>
<p>（東京）　海軍與外務兩省對於英國政府要求增加巡洋艦驅逐艦等共計四萬噸案、協議之結果、决定提出正式覆文、已於二十三日由有田外相訓令藤井駐英代理大使將此項覆文面交英國政府、其內容大致如左、</p>
<p>倫敦海軍條約所規定各節、縱令於本年底失其效力、但覺仍應遵守、是以英國政府要求將甲級巡洋艦編入乙級巡洋艦、並增加練習艦、諸如是類情形、對於上項精神認爲不無疑義、</p>
<p>但在實際問題上、條約超過量（日本六萬噸、英美約十萬餘噸）之廢除處分、在財政國防之見地上、自應採取適當應付之立塲、倘離開條約行使商議、具有此項意向、則不無承認之用意也云云、（二十四日同盟電）</p>
<h3>英俄海軍談判　訂立恊定繫於兩種因素</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　俄國某報今日載拉台克氏一文、謂英俄間海軍談判之恊定、繫於兩個因素、　德國允與英國締結同樣條約、　關於遠東部份之保留、蘇俄亟願與日本成立海軍限制之恊定、但迄今未有效果、在此協定未成立時、蘇俄不能束縛自已、而承認遠東艦隊之質的限制、或通吿關於遠東海上俄艦隊力量之消息、至於歐洲方面之質的限制、當然不因遠東保留而受妨碍、蓋蘇俄遠東艦隊、不能影響歐洲海軍之相對的力量也云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>日貨到處碰壁　日本决施報復</h3>
<p>對美繼續大量傾銷　對澳產品限制輸入</p>
<p>（東京）　日本官商對於美國及澳洲提高日本棉布入口稅之態度、現已大體决定、卽於六月二十日新稅率發生效力之前、對美實行大量輸出、以資囤積、至六月二十日以後、仍將繼續傾銷、不顧成本、以與美國國貨爭霸、而對澳洲方面卽擬實行「許可制度」、限制澳洲羊毛小麥之輸入日本與滿洲以爲報復云、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　有田外相鑒於日澳通商交涉中途頓挫、日美棉布恊定交涉亦吿决裂、决向打開各方面之關係邁進、蓋對澳關係已無法避免發動通商擁護法、一俟判明澳洲政府决定提高關稅案之內容後、有田外相卽採取各般國內之手續、爲擁護日本通商權之故、對澳洲之羊毛小麥等採何等之報復手段、要求國民之協力、對美關係以赫爾長官之通商自由政策之聲明爲理由、促美國之反省、由大局的見地、調整加入南美之日本與南北美之三國貿易、甚望最近赴任之栗栖駐比大使在美國爲側面的協力、對荷印關係以航路統制法可望確實通過、海運會商再開之準備已成、故命西澤總領事爲不斷之努力、藉以確立日本經濟之南進政策、因此由通商擁護法之見地、於外務商工大藏拓務各省聯絡之下、再由民間恊力、努力打開難關、（二十四日電通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　澳政府在衆議院宣布頒行新稅則、並採行進口執照制、以嘉惠最好主顧之消息、蘭開夏棉紡織業聞之、大爲滿意、預料新稅則實施後、澳洲進口之棉貨現由日本供給者、將易以英貨、每年貿易約增一百萬磅、孟却斯德商會主席稱、澳政府此舉、乃欲使英日紡織物貿易獲有更公平分配之眞正努力云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本特別議會　延至今日閉幕</h3>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<p>非常時期之財政問題（中）　馬寅初</p>
<p>中國財力之薄弱與集中之危險</p>
<p>應用於中國理無一致，中國歷代皆以藏富於民爲善政，故國民之富應有可觀，乃國民過去之積蓄多爲現銀形式，窖藏深處，在戰時實無何種用處，至於其他物力集中於上海者爲最多，財政集中上海無論矣，他如銀行存欵地產投資標金買賣有獎備蓄等等無一不以上海爲中心，且以極高之利息繼續吸收，現在上海銀行存欵額達二十一　萬萬元，鈔票發行額四五萬萬元，皆可視爲國民物力之代表，其準備金亦均集中上海，戰爭一起，上海爲敵人必爭之地，倘被攻取，准備金被其監視，不得自由調動，存欵與鈔票均將立成廢紙，紙幣流通之節圍允廣，雖販夫走卒無不各有紙幣，紙幣倘成廢紙，即不能用以買物，全國人心有不頓起恐慌者乎，後方人心恐慌，前方將士豈尙有戰鬬之勇氣乎，故鄙人前在廬山講演時，即已說明財富集中上海之危險，力主採分散政策，應减少大都市財富之集中，使散徧全國，藏富於民，則日本雖强，亦不能將我全國財富盡行轟毀，此爲經濟逃生之一路，若集中上海，一被敵人截斷聯絡，紙幣旣成廢紙，失其流通能力，關稅已無收入，公債多以關稅收入爲基金，本息無法支付，新債何從發出，政府財源枯竭異常，不亡何待，故鄙人兩年前即主張全國準備金應集中一處，隨軍事中心爲轉移，軍隊藉準備金爲後盾，得維持其價値，免滋糾紛，準備金得軍隊之保護，足以安定人心，消患無形，法無善於此者，此就兩年前準備金尙未集中之情形而言，今日準備金已採集中政策，情勢已變，此點似已不成問題。</p>
<p>紙幣濫發之不可</p>
<p>然則今日究應如何應付緊急時之財政需要乎，或謂稅制一時旣難改善，公債屆時又難發行，而戰爭之禍則迫在眉睫，欲求出路，其唯紙幣政策乎，蓋財政之目的不外以錢致物，那時多發紙幣，亦足多致物品，豈不可以達到目的乎，藎不得已之辦法也，要知發行紙幣，係金融之事，政府用錢乃財政之事，財政之消耗一去不反，金融之流通循環不息，如布商向銀行融通十萬元，購買棉花紡紗織布，此十萬元遂分散於社會，迨布織好賣出，收回鈔票，償還銀行，於是布被社會消費，鈔票亦收同矣，故爲商業發行之鈔票，有自生自滅之能力，此之謂金融，財政則不然，經常經費往往爲不生產的，允其戰時經費皆消滅於槍林彈雨之中，如發行鈔票，購買軍需物品，物品不久將歸於烏有，而鈔票則流通自若，能發而不能收，結果必至幣値跌落，物價騰貴，影響殊深，故財政與金融宜劃分淸楚，各自獨立，不可混淆，而時人雖認爲無法中之辦法，事屬救急，不可以常理論，要知救急辦法捨發行紙幣外，苟無他道，吾無間然，苟尙有他法足資救濟，吾實期期以爲不可，况論者之贊成發行紙幣救急，純就動員時之便利着想，未嘗顧及復員時之困難，倘顧及紙幣政策影響復員時之困難，吾知論者亦必有所躊躇矣，請以歐戰之結果爲例，當可瞭然，交戰各國如英美兩國極力從租稅方面設法戰費，雖公債發行之成分，遠較租稅爲大，但始終以租稅收人能淸償戰債之本息爲依歸，而紙幣之成分則甚少，故戰後恢復比較最易，法國則因重要區域被德國占據，稅收損失甚多，租稅收入應付經常費猶感拮据，故戰後之整理較英美爲難，德奧俄諸國幾以發行紙幣爲挹注，德國當初以爲戰勝確有把握，戰費可以取償於賠欵，不必增稅，加累人民，採用公債及紙幣政策，乃結果出其所意料，一敗塗地，馴至戰後紙幣幾成廢紙，國民兀氣損傷最重，雖戰後復興未嘗不速，全賴美國資金帮忙，奧國至今尙未恢復，一九二三年至一九二九年間美國貸借德國資本甚多，至今迄未能收回，故以後不敢再借，夫戰時之不換紙幣能免於跌價者幾希，然跌價之程度必須有限，紙幣之價値未至盡失，尙不至失其流通力，即國民之資金尙有相當保存，恢復自易，德國戰後竟以一千比林Billion（一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇）紙馬克僅能換得一個金馬克，幾粗紙之不若，國民流動資金損失殆盡，故國民經濟困難萬分，使無外債接濟，德國經濟之恢復，不知將在何年何月，中國將來如亦賴紙幣政策籌劃戰費，元氣之斵喪與恢復之困難，較德國又允甚焉，蓋中國國民本較德國爲貧，搜刮以後，積儲更難，美國又鑑於德債前車之轍，未必肯向中國貸放，即有貸放誠意，亦必爲日本所阻撓，且德國戰後之復興極爲英美人士所同情，蓋欲其恢復購買力，可恢復英美商品之市塲也，日本則不然，必欲使中國經濟永遠不發展而後快，將來阻撓我國經濟之復興者，將無所不用其極，此又中國之一難題，故吾人今日實行經濟動員，不可不顧及復員時之困難，愼重從事，</p>
<p>英國所以能以租稅爲中心籌措戰費者，則以稅制之優美也，英國以所得稅爲中心，稅率隨所得之漸大而累增，富有財產者負擔租稅之能力最强，故其稅率亦最重，旣合公平原則，苟遇急需，則稅率更加提高至所得額百分之六七十，亦不至耗損人民之資本，於政府之收入則能大增，故極富有伸縮性，此爲以租稅爲中心籌措戰費之利益，若紙幣則散佈全國，不論貧富均有使用機會，故政府如藉紙幣方法吸收民間資財，貧民之所失較富人爲允重，其太不公平無論矣，而資本搜刮之普遍與瑣屑，增加戰後經濟恢復之困雖，奚止倍屣，故以所得稅爲中心之經費籌措政策，集中其負擔於富人，而無傷資本，若以紙幣爲中心之籌措戰費政策，則處處相反，中國租稅制度以問接稅爲中心，固已不適爲戰時之良好財政制度，而紙幣政策之貽害又如是其大，此中國處境之特別困難處，</p>

<h3>化學科演講之三　中國化學發展史（下）</h3>
<p>國立編譯館專任編譯陳可忠</p>
<p>江南製造局主要的目的，是在製造槍砲同火藥，他的規模在當時和各國比較，也算是很大的。這時候我們雖然有這樣大的製造廠，並且翻譯了這樣多的化擊書，但是因爲當時的士大夫都主張「中學爲體，西學爲用」的論調，這裹所說的「用」就指他們目爲末節的工商等業，爲一般人所藐視的，所以眞正的化學人才和眞正的硏究空氣，還是造不成功，結果不特沒有進步，而且漸漸的退化了，現在要想在國內找一個像江南製造局那樣大規模的兵工廠，恐怕還找不到呢。民兀以後，南北的學府如北大，北洋，南高等校，提倡呌學，十分努力，但是設備和人才兩方面，都非常缺乏，用來敎學已經感覺很不够用，硏究更是完全談不到。不過大家在這個時候，才漸漸覺司到化學是應當提倡的科學，這種覺司，可以算做以後發展的基礎。自從國民政府成立以後，化學硏究的空氣，才眞正的樹立起來，而所表現的成續，也一天一天的多了。如果拿現在化學的發展情形同四五十年以前去比較，那眞是不可同日而語，因爲從前雖然有人覺得科學是應當提倡，但是不知道培養硏究的人才和硏究的環境，只是叫叫口號這好像無根的樹，無泉的井，不久就要枯竭的，現在中國化學可算是有了基礎了。第一現在硏究的人才逐漸增多，第二化學硏究的機關，已有了相當數量，設備也慢慢的上軌道了。第三埋頭苦幹的硏究精神，在國內各化學硏究機關中也已經培養成功。講到現在國內的化學硏究機關，我們可以將他們分爲三種，分別介紹如下：第一類爲公立的化學硏究機關，這一類比較重要的有中央硏究院的化學硏究所，北平硏究院的化學硏究所同藥學硏究所，軍政部的應用化學硏究所，實業部的中央工業試騐所，此外還有各省市如河北，山東，河南，廣東，廣西和上海的工業試騐所，以及廣州的科學硏究會，廣西的化學試騐所等機關。第二類爲私立的硏究機關，如黃海化學工業硏究社，上海中華化學硏究所，四川西部科學院的理化硏究所，此外還有英國人在上海所辦的Leste　r　Iustitute和日本人用中日庚欵所辦的自然科學硏究所，這兩個硏究所裹面，都有好幾個中國化學硏究員。第三類爲公私立的大學化學系和所附設的化學或化工硏究所，如淸華，北大，中出，燕京，南開，金陵等大學，此外如中央，浙江，武漢，滬江，嶺南，山東各大學的化學設備和硏究的成續，也都很有可觀。</p>
<p>從以上三方面看來，我們可以知道中國近年來在近代化學上，已建立了很强固的基礎。假如以後我們能够本着這種實事求是埋頭苦幹的精神繼續下去，要追上歐美的近代化學，也並非難事。</p>
<p>在民國以前，我們中國談小到化學的硏究，在民國以後，我們有一部分化學人才在國外作一點硏究，但是硏究的結果，都分送到外國的化學雜誌上去登載，所以就是有貢獻，中國的化學，在世界上仍是沒有地位的。民國二十一年，敎育部在南京召集化學討論會的時候，大家都感覺到這一種的需要，於是大家發起成立了「中國化學會」。這個團體最重要的工作就是刋行硏究刋物，將所有國內化學硏究的文章，全用西文發表（日本人就是如此辦法），一方面使世界各國知道我國對於化學的硏究情形，一方面可以促進國內化學硏究的空氣。到現在已有四年的歷史，硏究論文的數量，已經很有可觀。因此我國的化學在世界也有了相當的地位了。近年來國內科學硏究成績的表現，除了地質和生物以外，恐怕要算化學了。</p>
<p>在化學敎育方面，近來也有大大的進步，上面已經講過，在大學方面，人才已經逐漸增多，設備逐漸完善，硏究也慢慢的濃厚起來，像淸華大學道樣的化學設備，就同外國第一流的大學相比絞，也所差無幾，就是拿硏究成績來說，也還不錯。這般硏究人員，多屬靑年，如果假以月日，其成績當然更有可觀。至於中學部分，近年來政府對於課程標凖及設備標凖，都已加以釐訂，當然不久也會好起來的。</p>
<p>在化學工業方面，現在也和從前大不相同，我國在前淸末年關於兵工的製造，已經覺得非依靠其他工業不可。但是要想工業發達，非從發展化學工業做起不可。當時的化學工業實在談不上，但是現在則已經有了相當的基礎，醫如製鹼方面，有塘沽的永利鹼廠，廣東省營的蘇打廠等；製酸方面有上海的開成造酸廠，天津的利中酸廠，廣東，廣西省政府所辦的硫酸廠；肥料方面有浦口永利硫酸錏廠，硝酸有上海的天利淡氣廠。此外如上海天原電化廠，中國酒精廠也都是基本的化學工業。最近兩廣努力於建設，所設的化學工廠也很多。</p>
<p>要發展化學敎育，我們的目標須得注意三種因素：第一是人才；第二是設備；第三是硏究的環境。要發展化學工業，未嘗不靠這幾種因素。所以化學敎育同化學工業是互相關連，相得益彰的。我們先發展化學敎育而不顧到化畢工業，自然不應當；但是要想發展化畢工業，而不　到化學敎育所必須的因素，也發展不起來的。我們假定把中國目前方在萌芽的化學工業，移到滿淸末年，那末這種工業一定不會長久的，因爲在當時他們並不曾顧慮到人才和硏究環境的培養，只是機械的抄襲他人的成法，這樣在整個的化學過程上說起來，簡直毫無基礎，自然不能够與時俱進，而終於淘汰的。反過來說，假定淸末也有像現在的人才，設備，和硏究的空氣，那這幾種基本化學工業早已發達了。不特中國如此，世界各國也是如此，例如德國是化學硏究成績最好的國家，而他的化學工業也特別發達，這並不是偶然的。現在有一部分人老是這樣的疑問着：「究竟應當提倡化學工業呢？還是提倡化學硏究呢」？他們如果明白了上面所述的事實，以後就不會再提起這一種問題了。（完）</p>

<h3>青海旅行記　（續）</h3>
<p>— 莊學本</p>
<p>（三）羣科灘蒙旂</p>
<p>這一帶的帳房、也都是察罕諾們汗的百姓、閒談之間茶已經沸了、她再加上二勺牛奶、同時她在背後取出四個油膩的瓷碗、老婆子知道我們嫌髒、她很講究的拿碗在乾牛糞中擦了又擦、內外的油膩去了、糞屑都留在碗中、她又取一塊黑抹布揩得很乾淨、於是倒上四碗奶茶、交她女兒端了過來、再檢出一盒糌粑、放在灶沿路給我們吃用、各人肚子都餓了、毫不嫌髒的喝上了一碗茶、揉了一個糌粑、爲的要趕路、忽忽道謝出幕、上馬登程、</p>
<p>山谷中經過一個番人天罪的所在、坡上站着許多吃尸肉的神鵰（兀鷹）、我以爲正在天葬、馳着馬過去、鵰都驚散飛去、</p>
<p>今天來回八十里行程、走得很快、太陽沒有下山、已經回到宿地、管家他預備着我明天回來、所以都很驚異、</p>
<p>湮沒的古城</p>
<p>察罕諾們汗的地名叫「三角城」、因爲此地莊子的後面有一個古城名叫「三角城」、我在道中已經聽到有人說起這個古城的事件、所以我在此地曾經去探坊過兩次、城就在莊子的後面一百步、展開在哈爾琴山的下面、四週留有一丈高土垣的遺蹟、在幾個缺口的地方、還能找到磚牆痕跡、磚頭的大小長度在二尺左右、全城爲長方形、東首西首的城牆約長五百公尺、北首的城墙約四百公尺、南首的城墙三百公尺、南北有二個門的缺口、湟水的支流繞着牠東北二角蜿蜓南去、此地的高度三〇八〇公尺、在西寗的西北約一百七十里、</p>
<p>城中很平蕪、地面上沒有殘垣破屋的遺跡、地上多長滿了離離的荒草、野兎很多、聽到足音就起來奔跑、城內東北角上現在駐有遊牧人的一個帳房、西北角的外面也有同樣的兩個帳房、所以他們的牛羊占據着城的全部作爲牧塲、　　我們在西北角上一所帳房的前面、發現一個二尺高的小　、上面有很多斷磚殘礫、但是檢不到一塊完整的或一片有花紋的瓦片、城的東南上有一個四尺高的三尺高方形的石礎、俗名石槽、石縫中裝滿了亂石、像番人的麻柳堆一樣、距城以南二里路的道左、有一頭石虎深埋在土中、牠頭尾的長度有五尺、高約三尺、大部份石座已深陷地下、石虎雕刻的綫條簡單樸素、作風和咸陽霍去病墓的石虎很類似、牠的座石下我們用小刀挖去了一排泥土、見到有三個小篆「西超工」字樣、聽番人講下面的字很多、預料在這塊座子上可以找得到牠雕刻的年代、但是我們的小刀、挖堅硬的泥石是不行的、又是那天剛要上路、所以很可惜的中斷了、據說這頭石虎本來在城內與石槽一起、所以與古城的關係很重要、也許從牠身上倂能找出古城的年代、</p>
<p>神異之傳說</p>
<p>至於那頭石虎如何移在城外、傳說還有一件類乎神話的故事、廿一年青海省政府在西寗辦一個娛民會塲陳列所、徵集各地出品、湟源稅關上一位公務員他曾到過三角城、見過那頭石虎、他想把那頭石虎運到西寗陳列在娛民會塲中、當時他就打一個電話給省當局、塲中表示歡迎、但是進山的這一段路運輸很不方便、於是特地派工修築、使通行大車、即運貨的騾車、路修好以後、就放一輛大車進去搬運、當時地方上的番民不願意、因爲他們認爲石虎是保護地方莊稼的、但是政府要牠誰都不敢反抗、內中一個喇嘛播有「不走的預言、而大家也莫明其妙、起運的那日天氣很晴和、石虎在城中搬上大車、向下拉去、一路都很好、過了」里、天上忽然的烏雲密告佈、雷電交加、接着又是狂風驟雨、石虎在現在的地方掉了下來、人再多也抬不動、馬加多也拉不動、等於生根的一樣、這纔應了喇嘛「不走」的預言、過了一天、又忽然的在下深陷了幾尺、此後再也不要想移動牠半步、所以拉牠到西寗去的計劃就終止、</p>
<p>古城的探討</p>
<p>「三角城」是一個通稱的名字、究意牠呌什麼名字、在歷史上有何價值、很值得去探討、現在我們看到牠遺跡、和石虎的雕刻、就知道他決不是近代的一個新城、同時聽到有人講以前在城中發現的磚頭上、有「西滿國」字樣、果然我們沒有見到磚頭所以不能判牠爲漢城、但是各方面研究也有幾分可靠、青海是古時的西戎·西　·吐蕃之地、向稱邊塞、所以這個憑空獨立的城池、於邊防上一定有重要的關係、也許牠在某一個邊亂時期、經過一次戰爭而破敗、而荒落、而湮沒、</p>
<p>西寗府志上三角城的名稱祗有一個、據謂「在大通衛治西北、永安城西一百四十里、元時建築、今遺垣尚存、黑水經其南、今謂之額濟奈水、」按永安城現在疊源縣、在此地的正北、距此有幾站路、方向和距離、決不有差如此之遠、大致永安之西另有其城、所以這個三角城定非府志上所載的三角城、同時我們又敢說三角城的名字、定非古時的城名、</p>
<p>青海的城池、多數在西寗以東·以南·以北·遙相呼應、成一條垂直的防綫、所以在西寗以西的城池、廖廖可數、西寗府志上告訴我們、有三個古城在西寗以西、湟水流域和青海之濱、而情形相仿的、</p>
<p>一、「臨　故城」在縣西、漢置屬金城郡、晋屬西平郡、水經注、湟水東經臨　故城北、後魏縣廢、隋大業四年吐谷渾爲鐵勒所破、走入西平界求救、詔宇文述出西平迎之、述至臨　、吐谷運遁即此、</p>
<p>二、「臨　新縣故城」在縣治西、闞駰曰、臨　新縣在郡西百八十里、湟水經其南、城有東西二門、西北隅有子城、</p>
<p>三、「西海郡故城」在縣西、十三州志云、城在臨　新縣西、王莽遺使諷「卑禾　」、獻鮮水海允谷鹽池、置西海郡是也、今在青海地界、</p>
<p>除臨　新縣故城的建置、年代不可考外、其餘二個故城都是漢置、因爲漢時西　爲患最烈、而朝廷於青海的武功也最盛、</p>
<p>以上三城的方位距離和建置的年代、都有吻合之處、依我私人的揣測、三角城的古名也不出在這三城之間、但是我不能下一個盲目的論斷、因爲我於青海的沿革地理沒有較深的研究、同時對於故城也沒有發掘、但是我很希望研究青海歷史的、或考古的學者、加以注意、使這一個長眠的古城、能有一天發明、</p>
<p>空中飛冰塊</p>
<p>我們在探尋石虎的那天、就離開了古城、預備返歸白楊峽、沿着湟水直向南去、經過新開的楊家灘、那裏有幾家漢人的土房、在此地遇到三個柴達木出來的商人、他們在駱駝上走了二十四天、</p>
<p>天氣在下午又吹起微微的風了、轉過一個山灣、風勢更大些、路沿着河道直達到絕壁低下、猛烈的風直碰到絕壁上在馬前作漩渦、如果人遇到了也會受虧、一次大的旋風忽然把湟水中薄的冰塊捲起十幾丈高、在半空中旋轉飛舞、眞是奇觀、然而我們也很知趣、趕忙地馳馬躲避、防牠撒下來打破腦袋、聽說一次大風、把山上的羊羣都捲得無影無蹤、</p>
<p>三角城至白楊峽、距離不過四十餘里、三個鐘點就到了、我們仍舊歇在曹老爺家裏、蒙人是最忠厚的民族、他很熱烈的招待我們、同時又堅留在明天休息一天、並要求替他們家裏的人照相、我們因爲情不可却、也就接受了他的誠意、</p>
<p>當夜他們的莊廟中有米虎子、（神戲）他打起燈籠邀我們去參觀、唱戲的是莊上一部份漢人、也有鑼鼓行頭、唱的秦腔、夜寒甚烈、看客不多、見吾們到了特地跳加官、（祝福）他們也領到相當的賞賜、</p>
<p>明天早上、莊上要求照相的人很多、我們照過相以後、受一個喇嘛的邀請到東首五里山峽中的一個福海寺去遊歷、此地是察罕諾們汗所屬的寺院、</p>
<p>白楊峽風光</p>
<p>白楊峽地勢很險要、濱着湟水、自札藏寺以上五里之間、白楊成蔭、阡陌相連、兩端有兩個雄裝的山峽、像前後的大門、</p>
<p>此間是兩力克貝勒的百姓、全莊共有五六十家、內中有十分之三是漢人、莊上的人都種有幾斗莊稼、兼營牧畜的副業、養幾十個羊、十幾頭牛、莊稼一年一季、出青稞麥子、農田都在坡上、傾斜的磧田不甚肥沃、</p>
<p>在這裏找不到一所黑帳房或紫古色、完全二層樓的土房、但是有少數的窮苦者、他們挖空了土層住在窑洞中、</p>
<p>男女勞働在此地很相等、莊稼的耕種、以男子爲主、女子幫助、家庭的內務、以女子爲主、男子幫助、</p>
<p>這裏的蒙人都能講漢話、並且一部份年輕的人已不能講蒙語、他們男子的裝束也完全長袍短衣和漢人一樣、僅有少數的老者、留一根小辮、戴一頂毡帽、保存他蒙古的本色、女子的裝束、其外衣的式樣和羣科灘的圓領大袖截然不同、而和內蒙的窄細長裾旂袍很相似、邊上也棍一條狹狹的顏色花邊、衣料用布、冬季穿棉而不用羊皮、這也是她們的特色、耳墮很長、下垂兩肩、帽子也是和羣科灘同樣的皮耳帽、頭髮分兩股、垂在背後、一根狹長的辮套上掛許多長方的銀牌、飄蕩背後、此地的裝束和多數青海遊牧蒙人的裝束完全一致、所以一般人稱她們爲假蒙古、</p>
<p>她們信奉的也是喇嘛敎、而當喇嘛的人不多、病人吃藥的很少、多數是請喇嘛誦經、外科的症候、喜歡到溫泉中去沐浴、</p>
<p>結婚的異俗</p>
<p>蒙人是　道多禮的民族、各地是一樣的、他們相互間會面請安問牲口的好、客氣的親友見面時用哈達（疎絲帶）一條作見面禮、十七八歲的女子尚未出嫁、家庭中就在年夜請喇嘛念經、同時在她面上洒一陣法水、她的頭髮就可以分作二股戴辮套、這就是戴天頭、以後她和男人往來、生育子女、都能隨便、</p>
<p>婚姻尚自由主義、男子結婚的年齡在十五以上、女子的年齡以十五十七十九廿一、逢單爲吉利、婚前亦行納聘禮、以牛羊作財物、婚期都在秋間、因爲氣候適宜、莊稼已收獲了、牛羊也肥了、接親過門時、男家有許多女子在郊外唱歌跳舞迎接新娘、再有一部份男子拿了酒牛羊肉候在路口敬天、然後躍上馬、繞着女家陪親的女子堆裏搶她們的尖頂帽子、女家過來的男子、也照樣的馳馬搶男家女子的帽子、結果互相比較、那一面多那一面勝利、多一頂帽子勝一斤白酒、還要負方的女子唱一支歌曲、新娘在三日後就回門、七日後再來婆家、</p>
<p>喪葬之禮、種莊稼的農民行土葬用棺槨掩埋、遊牧的人用天葬鵰鳥、</p>

<h3>湖北農村雜寫　本報特派員成駿</h3>
<p>（十三）隨棗農村情形比較</p>
<p>棗陽農民疾苦、約有以下數項、　豫匪不時騷擾、　水旱災祲交侵、　租稞派欵與高利貸之盤剝、　團棍之橫行、今年四境之內、幸無風鶴之驚、田地亦未呈重大災象、租稞且漸减低、惟派欵及高利貸、則仍所難免、至於團棍橫行、係因民槍太多之故、（全縣民槍約八千支）現在情形如何、尙不得悉、但在過去、確有魚肉鄉里之事、各區團例擁槍自大、多者數百、少老數十、初因防匪而辦團、嗣因辦團而招匪、恃槍籌欵、成爲習慣、甚至無惡不作、民不堪命、有姜玉明者、任棗北區團大隊長時、以睚眦之怨、率其黨羽、令將李姓老人之二女及媳强姦以快意、姜以一逃了事、至今此案未結、又前駐軍某旅、剿匪雖稱努力、而派欵太多、並强徽烟苗稅每畝五元、（按現在業已全境肅淸）農民請自動剷除、又指爲「懶」、而抽收「懶捐」、此種奇聞、他處未有、</p>
<p>隨棗並稱、由來已久、茲試爲之比較、則田地隨縣較肥、棗陽較瘠隨係租稞制、大地主少、棗爲分田制、大地主多、隨田地皆有「頂頭」、棗只田有「頂頭」、隨之佃農擔負較輕、而耕牛種籽須自備、棗之地主收穫較多、而耕牛種籽由彼出、隨無高利貸、棗有大加一、此其異者、而苦於匪禍·派欽·民槍過多、則又彼此同病、記老由隨至棗、行一百八十里、又行一百五十里而宿樊城、所見路傍阡陌之間、遍植大小麥及豌豆、蔚然深秀、在棗陽境內、稍覺瘦弱、聞月前大風冰雹、棗屬麥種、多有凍死及損傷老、幸連日天晴、麥經日曬、漸有生意、將來可以收穫八成、損失尙小、途中行人、大半騎驟、糧食亦多以騾運其程途較短者、以雙牛駕車運之、較大市鎭、皆築土城防匪、一處則係石城、規模宏闊、其中爲大地主聚居、有田萬石者、計有五人、其數千百石者、更僕難數、無怪其堅壁深居也、車經一處、見草地上石塑神像大小二十餘座、若開座談會然、此地名十字坡、俗傳「為孫二娘賣人肉處、所塑之神像、卽武松張靑輩、原建有廟宇、因獲罪於天、故屢建屢焚、後遂置之、」此種傳說、當因地名十字坡、故附會及之、猶之伍髭鬚·杜十姨·之類、士入津律樂道、殊屬可笑、惟棗城東南四十里、確為光武故居、白水龍飛、復興漢室、在民族阽危之今日、殊值吾人景仰、惜不近大路、未能一式其閭也、（五月十二日發於樊城）</p>

<p>上海市各界追悼胡主席展堂先生特刋追悼胡先生以後應永久牢記的幾點  吳鐵城　　我們黨國柱石的胡先生，不幸於本月十二日下午七時四＋分在廣州逝世，胡先生為輔弼總理組織本黨功勞最高之一人，同時為盡忠本黨創造民國艱苦卓著之一人，其歷任黨國的各級要職，其福民利國的為政功勸，見諸二十五年以來中外各積報章簪各式記載者，已不一而足，我們稍能留心國事的，殆莫不了然於腦海，銘誌於寸衷。　　胡先生生前的革命功續如此，那麼，胡先生今日的撤手而逝，為我們黨國的重大根失又何待言，我們眷念動勞，對胡先生木盡其景仰而舉行盛大的追悼會，當然是凡屬國民莫不共掬同情之淚表示哀思啊！　　然而胡先生的革命勳勞，萬非幾幅的哀輓文詞所能記載，胡先生的革命精神，亦非簡單的暫短語言所能演述，且旂常竹帛的黨史國史，對有功黨國的偉人，自有其崇祀大典，與竹帛銘勳，自無待我們的饒舌。所以我們追悼胡光生，不必舖叙其生平事業，不必侈談共奇才異秉，要從有意義永久不斷的方面去懷想，要從胡光生所長普通人所短的方面去追思。換言之，卽胡先生做事能主張一貫，作官能不治私廠兩點，就值得我們萬世的景仰。　　我們相信凡事皆能成功，總要苦心毅力，胡先生之贊助總理革命，失敗的次數，指不勝屈，任何一次的失敗，莫不呈現「事不可為」的情狀，然而胡先生追隨總理，竟屢仆屢起，愈失敗愈努力，百折不撓之餘，遂有辛亥成功之日，而吾黨執政以來，國家根本大計寄托之重要法令，得胡先生長立法院多年的慘澹經營，典要得以確立，國難日益緊張，民氣日扳銷沉之秋，得胡先生「一士謬誇」振聾發贖，使國民知所警惕，需要臥薪嘗胆救亡圖存，此胡先生沉毅堅強之性，發為一貫的主張，我們追悼胡先生，應永久牢記為深刻的效法而求長進者一也。胡主席展堂先生遺象　　為國公忠應行操守不淪的條件甚多，最難者為不治生產，卽所謂真正的廉潔。胡先生作官數十年，依然淸風兩袖，死僅一棺附身而已，古人有言：「網家之敗由官邪也，官之失德，賄賂彰也。」胡先生能深識此中義理，廉潔自持，不置私產，最為辛苦卓絕的，也是這－點，此我們追悼胡光生應特別念茲在茲，取法胡光生之所長者二也。　　胡先生已矣，我們自今以往，不能仰聽胡先生之讜論忠言矣，然而胡先生之軀體，雖失知覺，而典型猶在，我們當加緊努力，效法胡先生之精神，公忠體國，以竟胡先生未竟之志，庶能慰胡先生在天之靈啊！悼胡展堂先生  童行白　　本黨當十四年總理中山先生逝世之時。胡展堂先生實居於國民革命的領導地位。我們統觀胡先生的一生。他的不屈不撓的精神。他的維持黨統。推行主義的主張。他的疾惡如仇。身體力行的操守。都有總理孫先生生前的風度。足以為本黨全體同志的帥表。因此。我們在這匪禍遍地。强敵壓境的中國。突然喪失了這偉大崇高的革命導師。覺得於黨於國。都是無可補償的最大損失。　　回憶十六年淸黨時期。如果沒有胡先生的忠貞主張。和蔣介石先生的武力征討。恐怕本黨革命史實。早已不復存在於今日。現在的中國。外患這樣急追。憲政快要開始。在這困難複雜的環攪之下。我們深信今後本黨救國救民的責任。更將倍重於往昔。舉凡怎樣集中國力。怎樣挽救危亡．種種問題。非但有關本黨生命之所　。抑且是黨亡國亡。黨存國存的重要關鍵。本來胡先生在世。我們深信他在蔣先生等敦促之下。一定能够負起責任。共支危厦。開闙出一條康莊大道。獨惜胡先生海外歸來。竟為疾魔所因．未克入京。　志而沒。這實在是我們同志同胞的最大不幸啊。　　雖然。胡先生的逝世。果然在黨喪失了一個領袖。在國喪失了一個元勳。然而偉大的革命事業。决不能因此而中輟。我們深信全黨同志。在胡先生人格道德的感化之下。全體國民。在胡先生學識中張的薰陶之下。一定能雊堅定信仰。確立言標。達到胡先生完成總理孫先生三民主義的遺志。革命的史實所詔示於我們的。十四年本黨因總理孫光生的逝世。奠定了國民革命北伐成功的基礎。蘇俄因列寗的去世。促進了他們新經濟政策的完成。因為一個革命領袖的喪失。革命精神决不會隨此而喪失。他的影饗所及。一定能够激發同志革命的情緒。增加同胞奮鬥的責任。我們希望全體同志。全國同胞。對於這次胡先生的逝世。大家憤發努力。團結一致。在中央的領導之下。先來解决我們當前的敵人。奠定我們民族中義的基礎。　　所以我們今日同志同胞的追念胡先生者。决不單是隆重的祭典葬典。可以作為胡先生一生革命的代價。我們一定要體念胡先生革命的精神。繼續胡先生革命的遺志。師承胡先生革命的道德。來推動革命的力量。完成總理的俗三民主義。這才是追念胡先生的最大意義。　　至就個人私交而論。則往年本人關於革命理論上曾與胡先生作數度之討論。函件待復。頗蒙多所指正。深佩胡先生析理之精微。見解之遠大。立塲之嚴正。心折已久。至今先生偉論尤存於拙著「唯物史觀與民生史觀析論」之中。而胡先生竟已溘然長逝。不複能重親警欬矣。尤有痛者。此次胡先生因同志之敦促。萬里　歸。擬欲晋京就職。滬上民衆。聞風懽忭。邀集各團體。籌備甚大之歡迎。本入當被推為籌備主任。不意籌備歡迎者未果。而今反籌備追悼。其私痛為何如乎。幷附數言。以誌悲懷。展堂先生逝世哀感  陸傑　　我黨元動　胡公展堂先生，於歐陸歸來，不幸遽以腦病謝世！值斯邦家多難，國仇日深的時候，全國民衆與吾黨黨員，正引頸冀　先生以「先天下之憂而憂」的熱情，和高潔的人格，繼，先總理未竟的微言大義，鞭策同志，振奮民族，使革命底於成功的境地。然而吳天不弔，豎子不仁，竟奪我以身許國而志彌堅的　先生以去！嗚呼，使我黨重喪導師，國家失一柱石；噩耗傳來，薄海同悲。　　先生的謝世不僅在加重我中華民國的損失，亦予後死者以更大的責任，言念及此，不禁淚濕靑衫也。　　先生的一生功業，百世莫京，黨史自有詳示，無庸聱述。唯我人之哀悼先生，非僅在標榜偉大的事功，而在追念先生如何能獲此偉大事功的因素：　　先生的成就，固然是　天獨厚，他方面還是得力於先總理的聖智的陶養曁服膺總理主義的不悖而來。換言之，先生的造詣，成於後天的「自强不息」底居多；因此，我同志間，可以得到一明確的教訓——卽能忠實於主義，以身許黨而永久不間斷者，都可以成為一偉大的革命戰士。先生現在是逝世了，希望我同志能以先生成功百世的因案，為自己修治的明鏡。若然，則第一個胡先生雖死，而第二第三以至千百萬之如胡光生者可以繼起不絕，豈非黨國前途之幸耶？先生英靈有知，亦當含笑於天。反之，我人如徒然夢想於先。生之事功，而不倉振　，不起而行，則　　先生雖在，一木焉能支大廈？又豈先生所樂聞？尤有進老：先生的偉大，誠然是自强不息地服膺總理主義而來，苟先生無富貴不能淫，威武不能屈，貧賤不能移的節操，又安能竟如斯完整之人格耶？此之謂「知恥」，故「知恥近乎勇」。望我同志於弔唁之餘，其共以先生所遺予之大勇而　勉焉。追悼文  上海市各界追悼公祭胡主席籌備會　　嚴嚴先生　遠紹海陵　甫申嶽降　　侯星精　少而頴異　長更崢嶸　聰明正直　嶽峙淵渟　薄游東瀛　鐵血加盟　貢身黨國　永矢堅貞　民國肇騰　中經變亂　狐鼠橫行　翊贊喆人　常在股肱　軍府再創　北伐師興　掌握機樞　竭盡忠誠　運籌帷幄　顯顯令名　受命代將　備極恩榮　總理有為　公則承之　總理有言　公則宏之　信道彌篤　見理彌明　艱難匡濟　慷慨長征　丁戊以還　奠定新京　身不解劍　身若懷冰　言旋東粵　瀛海騎鯨　半年征斾　萬里　程　朝野仰望　民衆師表　黨國耆英　奈何不　　薄海吞聲　此何時耶　公何以薨　神傷急刦　心瘁枯枰　旂常勣　　鐘鼎勛銘　百身莫贖　永式芳型中委楊庶堪　祭胡主席文　　維　中華民國廿五年五月廿五日。故人楊庶堪。謹以庶羞淸酒小腆之儀。致祭於胡公展堂先生之靈。而為文之曰：夫何哲人之萎逝兮。招魂哀乎江南。唯明幽之判淦兮。豈存沒血異心。九萬里而來歸兮。竊獨懷此故都。長憂國其若　兮。胡迅化於須臾。昔香山之崛起兮。嶺嶠降此異人。運籌弼於帷幄兮。塞義旗而誓天。亥之歲而胡亡兮。夏聲炳乎江漢。獨開府於百越兮。孰若尉佗之偃蹇。維奠都宅於金陵兮。謝關中與周　。陋叔孫之繇蕞兮。微尙希乎管葛。吳越彊而見削兮。義申興於晋陽。旋奔命而浮海兮。豈三神山之可　。余幼好此文詞兮。高敝帚以千金。忽逢君之拂拭兮。訴把臂以入林。　謀而夕笑兮。刺今而陳古國。英知復見仇兮。相與洵濡乎瀛州之下。歸三夏而不用兮。義幟忽揚乎舊鄉。期慶藺而餘媳兮。曰瞧君之在旁。余旣離　而吟澤兮。幾死直而遐征。壤賓之不終藏兮。復制挈乎中樞。冀消搖以寫憂兮。陟大陸曰歐羅。望天水之無際兮。偃　輪面臥疴朝濟馬流之羣島兮。夕寄乎西根之阿。忽反顧以掩梯兮。念州民之無家。皇天獨生此婞直兮。年旣老而無長。不能毀方以為　兮。吾固知其　枘也信沈憂之傷人兮。聞君髪之種種。膏自煎而木寇兮。矜太邱之道廣。余獨幽遜以尙羊兮。　散櫟之無恙。椒　兮肅陳生芻如玉兮。其人惜風流之頓盡兮。閩終古而無春。尙饗。胡主席治喪委會駐滬辦事處　祭胡主席文　　維　中華民國二十有五年五月二十五日胡主席治喪委員駐滬辦事處主祭楊庶堪曁全體同志謹具時花鮮菓之儀，致祭於中國國民黨中央常務委員會主席胡展堂先生之靈曰：　　鳴呼，庾嶺崢嶸，珠江浩翰，維公挺生其間，揚文藻於髻齡，馳令譽於弱冠，旣而輔佐總理，歷任艱難，全黨視為唯一重心老，不惟其學術之湛深，勳猷之炳煥，養疴海外，中樞先贊，蒼生引領，咸興斯人不出之歎，何圖力疾來歸，憂瘉煎心，終事多遠願，溯　　公獻身革命，罔聞初儘，智珠在握，成竹在胸，自潮州黃罔以至鎮南關諸役，運籌轉鑲，蘆無役而不從，泊乎部署香港，進襲廣州，轟轟烈烈，胥欠之謀，功雖未就，願亦稍酬，未幾武漢倡義，各省同仇，淸社遂屋，夫豈無由，由是首都以奠，正朔以別，公長秘書，鳥實綜覈，總理仗之决疑定策，露布所傳，電掃霆駭，統一告成，爰休兵革，奉命督粵，辭謝未遑，總理面詔，汝實適當，倘虞隕越，我力用襄，威斯言之懇摯，願赴火而蹈湯，曾幾何時，嗾趙刺宋，骫伙舉債諸惡，袁氏之逆跡彌彰，，公乃與贛湘皖諸督時，嚴詞詰責，撻伐用張，袁卒稱帝，遽召覆亡，發奸摘′伏，就為之倡，軍閥官僚，中風走狂，紀鋼疊毀，陰霸無光，驅除莫陸，義幟高揖，總理膺選，大法以昌，復主戎幕，師巒贛疆，變生肘腋，羣醜跳梁，公幸脫險，星夜倉皇，再接再厲，改建帥府，公贊密勿，茹辛含苦，總理北遊，公為砥柱，餘攀負嵎於東江，義師新挫於方豎，噩耗傳來，遽喪國父，公行遺教，首則提挈同志，鞠陳部伍，不畏政事之叢脞，與軍事之旁午，屢奏捷以班帥，竟雲披而目覩，成功不居，共黨跋扈，社會騷然，徬徨無主，公乃建議淸黨，奠都南京，芟夷務叢，七　不驚，小休滬凟，周游寰瀛，創設五院，亟費經營，立法貴恕，行注賣嚴，網羅多士，疏附典籤，客言讜論，民其爾瞻，身兼黨政，不辭勞怨，憂深思遠，理劇治繫，載更寒暑，不越都門，凡茲典型，具微　抱，心所謂危，不厭詳討，義正詞嚴，儼然師保，及夫發揮主義，旁稱博攷，詩怯韓王，平澹益好，泰山亳芒，散見　棗，忽焉遽逝，天荒地老，同志失忠純之領袖，民衆闕賢明之導師，彌留諄囑，惟冀三民主義之實現，曾無一語，略反於私，此在承平盛時，尙不勝入舉之悲，豈祝內憂外侮，傷珍瘁而凜亡危，同入或苔岑舊忝，或杖屨曾隨，風流頓礫，舉復何歸，海嚅選奠，璣與神颱，樸其反止，鑒茲然詞，尚饗，胡主席誄　　——胡主席治喪委會駐滬辦事處哀誄——　　維中華民國二十有五年五月十二日，中央常務委員會中席胡公薨，嗚呼哀哉，我共和建國，三民立義，總理遺教，施諸政治，重華協子，祇承愼位，鼎鼎胡么，國之柱石，文明以說，柔嘉維則，將建大業，庶續咸熙，倏　　算，國養尙遺，　志一往，吾民何依，嗚呼哀哉，聖訓攸垂，忍修無生，人去遒存，先正典型，節剛得中，於穆不巳，愛集有眾，含哀敬誄，共辭曰：　　洪惟我公，篤生穗城，祖　古水，延鄉之英，西江派流，文以道成，爰逮于公，天稟睿思，根道核藝，涵華養奇，　經博通，治史深微，公羊改制，革而信之，誓有與易，胎于斯時，山堂會文，鞠坡辯學，崢崢聲貌，嶷嶷頭角，經義治事，先知先覺，聞疑闕疑，靡不辜較，曰卿曰軻，羣書卓犖，以民為賣，義立甚確，檐曇旣罷，徜徉嶙絢，若日拾芥，虛空微塵，大言小言，嶺學津律，隱與辨族，要蘇斯民，明法輔禮，季時用匡，端藉取竟，爰凌搶滄，遂減悊人，幽音堂皇，昕合契結，言議相羊，亦越興中，聿纂同盟，擊腐摧朽，論難章章，風行神區，懾彼魅僵，粵挈同趣，南蹋瀛海，湛明鼓吹，遹厲辭采，百萬僑

<p>經濟專刊中國合會之評價（續第一七五期）  卜愈之　　二、合會的種類　　合會的種類：可分主要的和次要的兩類：主要的合會是：輪會，搖會和標會，次要的合會如：五虎會，蘇會，單刀會，拔會……等。　　在主要的合會中，輪會搖會和標會的不同，乃由决定收會的次序而異。在第一次聚會時，會脚們互相議定得會的次序，以後按次輪收，便是輪會；會脚得會，在每次聚會時搖骰次定，便是搖會；會脚得會，每次由投標的大小决定，標余最大者得會，是謂標會。現將三種的內容，略述如：　　　輪會：輪會的人數，有六人，七人，八人，九人，十一人不等，七人會通稱「七賢會」；十一人會特稱「新安會」。間也有人稱輪會的全體爲「新安會」或「徽式會的。輪會的得會次序，大都由會脚們互相　定，爭論很少，所以江北稱爲「至公會」；因爲會金的分配是前伸後縮，又稱爲「伸縮會」；因爲會期多是每年一次，又稱年會；（編者按：亦有十月八月於會規中訂明之）因爲會額的償還，用「分年本利攤還法」，所以又稱「攤會」。此外還有認會，輪收會，換收會，坐會……等名，都不外上說的理由。　　輪會的會額，始終一致，譬如首會規定一百元，以後各會脚都各得一百元。因會額不變，各會脚收會先後不同，所出會金，當然不同。收會早者應出的會金較大，收會遲者，應出的會金絞少，各會脚會金大小的不同，乃按相當的比例分配。例如七賢會的會金分配：是七元五角，六元五角，五元五角，四元五角，三元五角，二元五角是；又如十一人會的會金分配：是十四元五角，十三元五角，十二元五角，十一元五角，十元五角，九元五角，八元五角，七元五角，六元五角，五元五角是。從頭會（就是第一會會脚並不是首會）到末會，收　每遲一期者會金便减少一元，所以二會比頭會少出一元，三會比二會又少出一元，四會比三會又少出一元，如此類推。　　　會：搖會和輪會的分別，不但由於决定收會的次序而不同，便在會金的分配上，也大有不同。輪會會金，按比例分配，各會脚所出的會金，完全不同。至於輪會的會金，重會（指已得會的而言）的會金，數目是相同的，輕會的會金，數目也是相同的，至少每期的輕會會金是相同的。　　搖會分堆積會和縮金會兩種。　　堆積會的會金，重會和輕會所出的數目，始終固定。如重會會金是十元，大家始終出十元，輕會的會金是八元，大家老是出八元。　　例如有堆積會會額八十元，會脚十人，第一期會首得八十元，下次應還會金八元，並不加利。第二期頭會也得會額八十元，下次應還會額八元，加二元利，共十元（即重會會金）。第三期二會得會額八十二元，（因有重會一，出十元），第四期三會得八十四元（因有重會二），第五期四會得八十六元，……如此類推，每期重會的數目增加，會額便跟着增加，所以稱爲堆積會。堆積會的人數，有多至四五十的，所以會期較短，通常多爲月會或間月會，所以有撞月會或月月紅的名稱。　　縮金會會額，始終固定。譬如會額是一百元，始終是一百元。例如有一百元的縮金會一，會脚十人，第一期首會得會一百元，下次還會金十元，加利二元，共十二元（即重會金數目）。第二期頭會得會一百元，下次還會金十元，加利二元，共十二元。這一期的一百元之中有重會一，十二元，一百元减去十二元，餘八十八元，由十個輕會（連得會者）平均分擔，每人應出八元八角。第三期會額一百元，减去兩個重會會金二十四元，餘七十六元，由九個輕會平均分擔，每人出八元四角四分。以後重會越多，輕會所出越少，所以稱爲縮金會。縮金會的人數，至多只在二十左右，所以會期較長，通常是每年二期，兩三個月一期的較少　　搖會又有單式和總式的分別。單式會由會首一人約定會脚；總式會由會首請定會總二人，三人，四人，五人，或六人不等，因稱爲二總會·三總會·四總會·五總會·六總會。　　總會的來源，由於會額較大，會首交游不廣，囚請至親好友數人擔任會總。再由會總各請會脚數人，完成一會，其詳細辦法，有專長在，恕不贅述。　　標會：有投票的意思，每期得會，用折現競爭的方法。例如會額五十元，會脚十人，第一期會首得五十元，以後每期還會金五元（即重會會金）。第二期有甲乙丙三人預備得會，甲投標二角，乙投標四角，丙投標五角，標金以內的最大，所以丙當得會。重會會金始終不减。輕會會金，五元之中扣去五角，是四元五角。這一期重會一，應出五元，輕會九，各應出四元元五角，丙所得會額是四十五元五角。（　45X9　5十）　　以後各期，都照這方式投標，標金最高者得會。　　以上三種會式：輪·搖·標·以輪會最古，流行最廣，名稱最繁，而收會的次序，大家平心靜氣的議定，會金的分配，誰吃虧些，誰討便宜些，都不大計較，很有「君子無爭」的古風。搖會是由輪會演出，牠的好處，收會次序比較靈活，人數伸縮也比較方便，而會式內容也比校複雜，這顯然是社會進步後的產物，至於標會乃是最近廣東省的發明。　　輪會人數較少，大抵限於親友們，合會的目的，可說全在於互助；搖會的人數較多，有時由會總介紹，相互間的感情較疎；又因爲一班人視搖會爲搖彩，由此引起了不少的迷信和投機。標會的風氣最薄；出會者不因交情，乃因謀利，會　沒有限制，常等於高利貸的利率，所以標會是常倒敗。　　總之，這三種會式的過程，由感情的結合進於利害的結合；由互助本位，進於謀利本位　　在次要的合會中有五虎會，蘇會，單刀會，拔會……等。　　五虎會，有會脚二十五人，合五五而成二十五，所以稱為五虎會。會期通常是四個月一次，每年舉行三期，會首得連收五期。例如第一期每人出五元，共集銀一百廿五元，會首收一百元，所餘二十五元，則由會脚搖骰决定。第二期每人仍出五元，共集銀一百二十五元，會首收一百元，會脚之一收二十五元。如此進行，直到第五期，會首共收會額五百元，會脚每人共出二十五元。第六期起，各會脚再不出會金，而會首則每期還會金二十五元，歸各輕會搖骰收會，到六年多會滿。　　蘇會，流行於江西寗都，命名的用意，到現在還不明白。會首也是收會五次，但收會的方法，不是在第一·二·三·四·五期中連收，而是在第一，三，五，七，九期中間收。道個會每年一轉，會脚十人，共十五期，除以上的五期歸會首收會外，所餘各期歸會脚認定輪收，乃是輪會的用意。　　單刀會，道個會的會金和會脚人數多不限制，會脚少的十多人，多的幾十人，各人所出的會金多寡，看和會首的感情厚薄而定，厚者多出，薄者少出，會金只出一次，其用意乃是用捐欵的方式帮助首會，所以又叫「帮頭會」，會首得會後，不一定償還。　　拔會，用單刀會的會式，各會脚所出會金都是一律，會首收會時，叫會脚用搖骰法，或拈　法决定次序，以後按期拔還，便稱爲拔會　　此外還有幾種會，或不大重要，暫不贅述。　　以上的四種會式，現在雖不大通行，沒有甚麼重要，可是其中有兩個特點，很値得我們研究，就是無論那　種會式，只是會首和會脚的關係，會脚之間，絕無關係；其次會首對於會脚不但不給利，甚至不還本，這純粹是感情的結合，互助的精神，遠出於輪會搖會之上，因此作者臆斷：這乃是合會最原始的方式。（這層應待硏究。）　　　合會的目的　　合會的目的，可分兩類：就是消費類和儲蓄類；消費又分個人消消和團體消費，儲蓄又分單純的儲蓄，保險，投資等，茲分誌於下：　　　消費類：　　甲，個人消費：誰也知道合會本來的用意，全在於消費。例如有的合會，爲生活的急需，有的用於婚嫁喪慶，有的用於子弟的敎育費·納稅·還債等項，總之，無論什麼用途，如要免去高利貸的盤剝，只有向合會的路上走。個人消費中，還有救濟一項，合會不是爲已，乃是爲救濟他人，如替一個私塾敎師或替一個孤兒或寡婦合成一會，這也是常有的事。　　乙，團體消費：團體消費中，因各地情形不同，名目很多，這裹只能略舉幾例：　　農禁會：在浙江衢州一帶，農禁會的組織，或保護靑苗，或防護桑葉竹筍果木等組織，多以村爲單位，其目的不是禁止牲畜蹂躪，就是防備偷竊。　　防水會：靠江湖海邊的低地，常常結合會社，保護堤壩，防止水患，如浙江蕭山縣民問有江塘會，又稱張神會（因護塘而死），王夫人社（因築堤而犧牲，）壽昌縣有堰壩會，都是爲防水而設。　　路會橋會：當山路崎嶇，或道路低濕的地方，道路和橋樑容易損壞，因此有些地方，常有路會橋會的組織，會中少者七八人，多者七八十人。　　聯莊會：在淮河流域各地鄕間，爲防止盜賊起見，乃聯合數莊人民，各家出人若干，出錢若干，組織起來練習藝能，以便防止不測。　　巡夜會：或單獨一村或聯合數村組織起來，各出錢若干，僱人巡夜。（這些會的詳細情形，請參看王着：中國之合會九十三頁—九九頁）　　　儲蓄類：　　甲，單純的儲蓄：我們知道：會首整借零還，大都用於消費；會脚零出整收，大都屬於儲蓄。但會首合會，目的也有儲蓄的，不過比較的少。　　儲蓄用團體方式的，在河北有攢錢會，武漢有堆金會，膠東有自治儲蓄會。廣東有三益會，乃是用比較大規模的組織，相互間勉勵傭蓄，（各會章程參看王著第七十五—八十六頁。）　　乙，保險：保險中最著的有溧陽長壽老人儲蓄會，其目的是老人們生前儲蓄，以備死後棺柩喪葬的用費。此外各地有稱長壽，福壽，壽星等會，或稱葬親·白袍·白帶子等會，名稱雖不問，而目的則同。　　丙，投資：由零碎數目，積成一宗欵項，叫做儲蓄；用一宗欵，投於某項事業：如經商，營業。買田，購屋……等，用以生利，叫做投資。城市的人，常常用合會終商營業。農人常常用會欵買牲畜，改良農業，買田產房屋等，都屬於投資的範圍。　　總括的說，合會的目的，用在消費的多而用在投資的少：消費中用在個人方面的多而用在公益方面的少，這實是非常可惜而急應矯正的事。　　　合會的估價　　對於估價應分合會的本質，合會的技術，兩項脫明。　　　合會的本質：本質方面，分優點和劣點說明：　　　優點：合會在中國流行一千多年，簡直「家喻戶曉婦孺皆知，」牠所以能這樣流行，必有牠的特質，特質是什麼呢？正以爲這個團體，是感情的結合，而非利害的結合（說到這點當然最近流行的標會除外。）關於這種特性，會書上說得很明白。常州搖會會規說：『夫會以「義」始，必以「信」終。』金壇　總會會約說，『本會以「義」為始，以「信」為終，今蒙會友爲集腋之謀，濟燃眉之急……。』無錫五總會緣起：「會之由來舊矣，至今而信行者，「義」以成之，「信」以守之，克全其終，是其所以傳流也。」又　總會會規說，」緩急相濟，有無相通，有往必來，有施必報，自古以來，即本此旨以稱會。」由以上幾條看來。會，乃是朋友或親友的集團，合會的動機起於「義，」就是朋友有通財之義；維持會的方法，在於「信，」而合會的目的，在於「有無相通，緩急相濟，」所以會書的封面上，常寫着「通財之義，」「篤義通財」等字樣，又輪會的七人會和十一人會常務爲「七賢會」和「十賢會，」其附意不但在附會風雅，並在比擬友誼。　　朋友何以有通財之義呢？照「友」的字義說，是左右手，左右手天生是互助的，旣成爲友，必能互助，不能互助，便不是友，「友義」或「友誼」就從這一點來的。而通財是朋友間最尋常而最要緊的事！也是最能證明友誼的行爲。所以「管鮑分金，」乃是會書中常引的故事。　　維持友誼是什麼呢？在於信，所以儒家以「朋友有信」爲五倫之一。　　可見「信義」　字，在中國是哲學的原則，道德的標準，組織社會的要素，維持朋友的精髓，這一件寳貴的東西，便做了合曾的本質，我以爲合會在中國千百年繼續不懈，其惟一的原因就在道裹。　　也許有人反對我說，中國現在困苦顚連，一切破產，你還在這裏頌揚信義，鼓吹一件小小的老制度，未免冬烘，現在只有學西洋東西，才能救國。我的回答是，西洋東西如比中國强，不但當學，應當快學精學；若不如中國的，那麼我們不應一切盲目的崇拜人家的，忽視自己的，你們那裏知道，西洋的合作，目前正是困難萬分，到了走不通的時候，有的合作社簡直成爲普通商店，因此有人主張將合作主義（Cooperalion）改爲意大利式的組合主義。　　（Coporatisme），可見合作社主義已搖動了。其原因在那裏呢？因爲辦合作的許多人，不明白合作社不是營業的工具而是道德的工具，其目的不重在發展個人的經濟而重在發展公衆的利益。因此好多合作社雖　了合作的招牌，實際社員們作而不合，甚至相互不認識的很多，只聽幾位幹事將合作欵項用來買股票證券，營業投機，因此倒坍的很多，其原因就在缺少這種「信義」本質，而墮入市儈營利的行爲。　　合作的哲學是Solidarite，譯爲「聯帶責任主義」，這個字的意義、本於Solidaire，是「固結如土」的意思，旣然固結了，一人活動的好壞，必牽動全體，所以演成聯帶的責任。基特敎授在聯責主義（La　Solidarite）中說：『資本生義的經濟學的格言：「各求私利，公利在焉」。聯　主義的格言正相反：「名顧公利，私利在焉」』。他又引用十八世紀的哲學家，愛沃緒（Helvetuis）的名言：『道德最高的成功，在將私利與公利聯合一致』。基特又申說道：『假使私利與公利衝突時，寗當去私而全公』。（見所著聯資主義一七五和一七六頁）可見聯　主義的學說雖新，而「去私從公」的道德觀。與中國哲學是一致的。拉力貝（M．Auge　Laribe）在農業組合與合作（Syndieatset　cooperastives　Agricoles）中說：『要求各種合作的發展，須以「道德」映入日常的經濟生活，合作的利益，不重在物質，若將合作看作商業，目的在賺二三厘的利息，那麼實不攸得提倡』。又說：『合作主義用「道德」的力量訓練個人，牠實是一個忠厚眞誠和正義的學校』。（見一八一頁）由這兩位合作專家的主張看，聯責的精神，合作的目的，在公益不在私利，在道德不在物質。　　到此，我們必能明白：合會之所以千古流傳，合作之所以不久衰微，乃是在實行方面。一是重靈魂！信義，一是重軀殻—物質。　　到這裹應聲明的：上面的結論，乃是指合會的原始的精神說，到了現代，因爲整個的經濟破產，對於朋友間信義的維持，大爲困難，這不是合會制度的不行，乃是整個的社會的金融竭絕，例如一些現金都集中到上海，敎人民如何顧全信義？　　　劣點：合會的本質，這樣淸高純潔，實是難得。但不幸有一個弱點，就是友誼是私人間的表現，換句話說，合會的基礎，建在個人主義之上，試看合會大都是滿足個人的要求，雖有一部分作社會的公益，但作用極共薄弱，假使我們能將合會從個人主義的基礎移到社會主義的基礎，少爲個人，多作公益，那麼合會便成爲現代理想的東西。　　II合會的技術：技術分組織和方法兩項：　　甲·合會的組織：　　　優點：在沒有討論組織以前，先當辨別合會在現代合作主義（La　Coopeation），麼地位。我們知道，合作主義包含三件東西，桑迭加（Dyndicats），合作社（Cooperatives），和互助社（Mutualite）；桑迭加是存政治作用的團體，我們不必去討論。單就合作社與互助社說；合會究近於那一種。要說明這一層，先當辨別，合作社和互助社的不同，合作社是經濟作用的團休，其目在以合作的方式或經營實業；互助社是交互服務的團體，其目的在守望相助，救濟困難，在理論上，我們當將合會歸屬於合作主義中的互助社，從事實說，也是如此，互助社包含互助信用（Le　credit　Mutuel）和互助保險（L'assurance　Mutuelle）。而合會對於這兩個制度，雖是具體而微，却是兼而有之。　　我們知道，互助信用和保險，對於現代貢獻很大，價値很高，不料能在千年前的古制度—合會中，我出這樣簇新的東西，這實是驚人的事。　　關於合會的組織，因為是朋友的集團，所以凝結力非常大。我們知道，要成朋友，必定經過三個步驟：一，認識，二，了解，三，愛護。合會的分子，常常達到第三步愛護；而合作的分子，往往互相不認識，難怪西方敎援對於合會的凝結力，非常贊嘆，而他們對於合會中之有會酒的辦法，尤其稱為結合感情的妙法　　　劣　：合會的凝結力雖大，但團體的規模太小，通常只是十人左右，二十人的便少，四五十人的更少，將來如能將合會用於公益，將團體擴大！大家能「出入相左，守望相助，疾病相扶持」，豈不更有價値？　　乙，合會的計算法：　　　優點：還債的方法有兩種：一是每年付利，定期還本；一是按年本利攤還；就是說，每年付相當的利，利以外再抽還一點本，到一定年限，本利都不知不覺的還淸。這個方法，法國呌做「按年本利攤還法（Anuuite）。　　我們知道，每年付利，定期還本的方法，從古以來，不知道剝削了多少窮人，敗壞了多少家產，而這個方法呢，基特敎授說得好：「這個方法，還債期須要相當的長，假設三十年·五十年·七址五年·九十九年·在這樣長的年限中，用複利的方法計算本錢。每年應還數目，非常的小，這個小數目，加於利息上，合起來比，普通借偵的利息還低些，因此借債的人，每年只覺付利，不覺還本，到一定期限，本利便都淸還了。　　『如要用數目話明舉例如下：例如借債二千元，利率五釐，那麼　年利息一百元。如將本金分七十五年攤還，用複利計算，每年只要　還十二元，本利每年只要一百十二元。每年所還只當本金的五·五％。七十五年內，本利便都還淸了。』　　他的結論是『這實是一個最巧妙的方法。』（見所著農業合作四十九頁）　　現在各國的信用合作保險，以至購買貴重物件，都是用分年攤還法。這一個精妙的方法，也不料在老制度　合會中尋出，試檢查合會中兩句口頭禪：會首是「整借零還」，就是一分年攤還；」會脚「零儲整收，」　是「分年攤儲。　　　劣點：合會雖用分年攤還法，但計算法不完全和現代所說的分年攤還法相同，如輪會所用是等差級數法，搖會和標會是攤本加利法，分配不平，計算不確！關於這一點。王楊二位的　作裹，討論改良的方法很詳，恕不贅說　　結論：這一個小小的制度裹，誰知道竟深映了合作的精神，包含了互助信用和互助保險，應用了分年攤還法　原則；而這種精神，制度和方法，我們知道，不是出於學者思考發明的結果，乃是一班老百姓歷代實騐的結晶，所以我們要改良這個制度必須非常審愼，切不可摭拾西洋一點理論，或由個人一點理想，憑空提倡改良，一不小心，便將牠的本意失去了，精神破壞了。合會的內容，具社會和經濟兩種性質，合會的作用，雖是往來借貸，而合會的本質，是親友互助，是社會性是主要，而經濟性是次要。有些人不明白這一點，捨本逐末，專站在純經濟的觀點上改良合會，於是有些人主張，物價太貴，應取消酒席：他們何會知道，會酒正是結納交情的妙法，是這個制度的特色之一。有些人見合會有時倒敗，（倒敗的原因，大部分由於整個經濟破產，）由於缺乏立法根據，其實西洋立法何等嚴密，而合作社成千萬元的破產，法律却有什麼辦法？有的見人事變化不測，主張將會期縮短，其實會期越短，每次攤還數越重越難，正背了分年攤還法的原則，（在法國最長的農業信用借欵，期限竟達九十年。）總之，大部分改良合會的主張，都要照「銀行式」或「表面的合作式」將合會從友義的結合改爲利害的結合，在金錢上務必錙銖計算，而在精神上，則任其墮落萎靡？這乃是千年未朽的一個老制度的危機！　　前已說過，合會近於現代的互助社的性質。基特在聯責主義中論互助社說：「互助社的內容，如人壽保險，疾病保險，殘傷保險……等，乃是富帮窮，强帮弱，少帮老，健帮病，社員之間，誰帮誰多少，誰出多少，誰收多少，並無平等之可言。到這裹使達到，一聯資主義」的最高程度。　　他又說：「旣達到最高程度，我們不必再求借貸的計算精確，乃在求窮苦富裕間的互助得當。」（見聯責主義一三六，一三七頁）　　作者以爲這幾句話是合會的精神，也是改良合會應取的途徑。（完）商業新聞證劵　上週債市每多倒掛　　上週（五月十八日至二十三日）華商證劵交易所、因係五月份期貨最後一週、環境上無大變化、籌碼上存帳亦不多、故傾軋之風、並未熱烈、政府恢復硬幣、市場上並不受若何刺激、華北狀况、世界形勢、均係秣馬厲兵、岌岌不可終日、最近日本之廢棄　國公約、顯係劣馬擺脫覊絆之勢、前途形勢、僉使人不寒而慄、而公債市場、則一致昔日在風鉅浪之故態、依然平平穩穩、水波不與、實以金融界大部份完全袖口傍觀、不入局、　之湖深而水淺、縱有在風、波紋亦細、故市况一時殊不易有鉅大震盪也、今日爲五月份期貨最後一日、當仍係紊亂狀况、上週經過、週一爲十六及五十四號等買進好二三角、週二川帮稍吐出、多頭略有掉期、市價跌多漲少、爲數仍祇二三角、週三最爲呆滯、終日盤旋、少數掉期、上下極微、週四稍有軋空、三十五號續有賣出、市况近高遠低、週五六兩日、在極安定之中稍稍軋空、市價逐日微漲、週六稍多、惟終係因空方掉期、故遠期不如近期之高、市價每每倒掛、趨勢終非好現象、市價結果、大都漲四五角至九角不等、成交總數、共計二千八百五十八萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於後、（單位元成交單位百元）糧食　河下米銷路仍細　　（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到十餘號、（貨共三千餘石）、市况依然不振、迺以本銷殊　、包胃北洋帮祇辦千餘包、致成此久疲不振之局面、茲若厚早粳及薄稻行情除高料者勉定外、中市貨悉有修幾分者、杜洋尖亦帶貶數分、陰變元平庸、　　（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船念餘號、市上各貨去　白粳稍轉活動、價中次者轉昂三五分、薄稻及陰元牟尖到銷兩和、市形定勢、變元零化平常、價形高提、中次價稍帶軟勢、杜埠客秈零化滯細、價又疲數分、其餘各貨價定勢、紗花　西部美棉缺雨收盤堅穩　　昨美棉開盤、各月由不動至跌三磅音、買賣不多、七月期因同業買進而堅、棉農套賣、但外商買進、市况大致平靜、同業仍在等候華盛頓方面之進展、新棉因西部缺雨、賣氣稍殺、然亦不足引起買進、現需呆滯、布疋絞活、收盤堅穩、計現貨漲五磅音、期貨由不動至漲五磅音、英棉現貨漲二點、期貨漲一點、印棉初因歐洲出口商賣出而疲、後因空戶抵補及同業買進而堅、計平果爾漲一·二五至跌〇·七五羅比、　姆辣跌〇·七五羅比、白羅溪跌〇·五至〇七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十三日電）　　又據孟買電、二十五日七八月期白羅溪花開盤預測、爲一百九十九羅比半、較上日漲〇·七五羅比、　　埃及棉週末統計（單位千康泰）海味　漲參存底頗感殘缺　　離出新期尙有一月　價較前盤的張十元　　海參出新之期、最早約在六月下旬、或七月上旬之間、現下陳貨來源、各檔均缺、本埠存貨、花色亦殘缺不齊、致客帮需要、常抱無貨可供之憾、昨西洋號家、開出望加錫梅花參十一件、三支價二百二十六元、四支二百零二元、五支一百九十一元、六支一百七十七元、八支一百六十六元、又望正路灰岩參八件、四六支價一百七十一元、八支一百五十三元、十二支一百四十一元、二十支一百二十二元、二十八支一百風二元、雪梨白底靴參五件、六支價一百七十二元、八支一百五十八元、十支一百四十四元、六支北海白底靴參二件、價一百三十七元、查各檔　價、較前盤約漲十元光景、受手　稱踴躍、號貨如數售通云、五金　蓊園鉛絲步回鬆　　花園鉛絲、近來到貨擁擠、故積存市貨異常豐滿、出路因客帮停辦、而廠家又少點綴、是以市情十分軟弱、况連日東洋定價頻見鬆動、所以申市沽盤亦多下降、刻市每擔沽三元五角、比前回鬆數角、聞大批成交及現欵買賣、其行情尙可低廉一一角不等、查昨市開出達有七八十扎、均係虹口一帶五金號拆去云、白鉛因銅廠停辦跌價　　白鉛銷場向賴本埠銅廠以及兵工廠等去路為大宗、近來兵工廠因均購辦國產白鉛、而銅廠則因銅市呆木、所以添配有限、採辦甚少、以此白鉛銷路日見减少、行情因供過於求、步步下降、刻市沽二十四元、查交易祇有零星而已、大宗買賣可云毫無、</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （肖白）　　憂患是人類的大敵，煩悶足以毀滅人類一切的創造和進步。　　因爲現在我們的時代，正是一個苦悶的時代，所以，有着不少的人，都因了環境的種種關係，生出了許多憂患和煩悶，而走向頽廢消極，甚至自殺的路上去，那實在是莫大的錯誤。　　我們要曉得，世界是需要我們去創造的，我們只要堅决地努力，是可以克服一切的困難，而獲到最後的勝利的。　　所以，我們應該以愉快的態度，和堅决的自信力，來打破現在的困苦和艱難，以「樂觀」代替「悲觀」，「希望」代替「失望」，强健我們的體力，培養我們的實力，創造出一切新的東西來。　　「憂患能使人老」，但愉快的自信，更能使一切年老的人，也都覺得年靑起來。蔣院長的樂亭  胡爲盛　　奉化溪口是蔣院長的的故鄕。　　樂亭在溪口的上邊，是舊日的文昌閣，蔣院長改建後定名爲樂亭的用意是——要溪口地方上的父老同樂於其中——。樂亭的後面，有武山；武山的前半身，有一個穴洞門，呌做「武嶺」，它的建築是城門式的。這二個字，是出自于院長的手筆。武山俗名馬鞍山；（因爲遠望形似馬鞍）。樂亭是它的頭，好像俯在錦溪飮水。（因爲樂亭的下面是錦溪）　　當你坐在樂亭中，如向道旁遠遠地望去，那列列有序的參天古木，及對岸的良田美地，桑竹成蔭，阡陌交通，雞犬相聞的溪南景色；眞會使你忘懷是處身人間……。　　溪南與樂亭之間，橫鋪着一灣溪水，澄淸如鏡，人們依在欄杆上遠眺這優秀的溪水，不但能看到成羣結隊的游魚，而且水底下平鋪着方的圓的扁的……石塊，亦能看得淸淸楚楚，歷歷如繪。　　記得曾有人詠詩頌樂亭之宏巍：（大槪是谷老師吧）現在我把它抄錄於下：　　『蒼松翠柏，掩映着玉宇瓊樓；　　恍若瀛州仙島，亭榭巍峨。　　岸畔仙橋一架，錦水瀠洄；（錦水卽剡水）　　相對溪南修竹，淸影萬竿。　　美哉，蔣公之宅；　乎，人傑地靈』。朱鴛雛夫婦公葬記  亞厂　　雲間詩人朱鴛雛，與其夫人許蟬仙女士，怛化將及十年，遺柩久厝松江谷水道院未葬。　歲，鴛雛故人李冷，來掌松江縣篆，松地學界與鴛雛有舊者，乃以發起公葬鴛雛夫婦爲請，李氏諾之，爲撰緣起，公開徵求賻贈，荏苒迄今，已歷數月。比者公葬之期在邇，李氏特倩中委葉楚傖氏撰就墓銘，俾公葬時勒石樹之鴛雛墓門，茲將其文錄於後：　　朱君鴛雛，　亭人也；幼孤貧，不甚讀書，而特穎悟，十餘歲能爲詩詞，見賞於里宿學楊先生錫章，（亞厂按：即楊了公先生，爲鴛雛社吳中，以文學鼓吹種族革命，江南北從之者如雲；言詩守盛唐，尤喜龔定　氏，摘集排比，幾於人手一編。鴛雛獨與姚鴛雛遊，學為南北宋凄淸枯澀之音，雖介以入社，社中人勿善也。（亞厂按：鴛雛初為南社社員，南社言詩宗盛唐，而鴛雛則取宋，持論不同，乃與柳亞子發生衝突，互相撰文挾擊，鴛雛遂爲南社除名。）鴛雛旣不得意，走海上，以粥文自給，亦嘗爲敎師，未幾，輒棄去，貧困顦領，無以自僇，遂病肺，猶日爲小說家言，資薪米。娶於許，奉其母居外家，若為贅，年二十四卒，逾數月，其妻亦死，遺子一女一。卒後將十年，柩停未舉，其友李冷，來宰松江，始爲醵資合葬於邑之公墓，而屬楚傖爲之銘。銘曰；「　其才，嗇其壽；」自於斯，名不朽！」　　昔黃仲則病歿解州，其友洪稚存聞訃，自陝西奔往，經紀其喪；故稚存哭仲則文，有「龔生雖夭，猶有故人」之句。或謂鴛雛之個性孤傲與仲則似，詩才矯健與仲則似，遭際迍　與仲則似，則今此之葬事，其故人爲之辦理者，亦與仲則似矣。載譽歸來  中央處男  周賢　　世界是反了。這年頭兒，娶老婆，若再要問對手方是吾處女，這似乎已是思想落伍得無可再可憐的了。最吃香的，是一而再，再而三，和丈夫離婚的女子。越是會得離婚的，越是能受人歡迎。隔日才在離婚法庭上解决離婚案的婦女，下一天，便和人在討論着結婚手續的，已不能算是曠古听無之事了。　　可是在別一方面呢，說來也眞是十分悽慘，男子們，却反而以處男爲貴了。最低的限度，總也得是一位沒有家室之累的所謂Bachelot，才能在交際塲中混混。若是你帶了太太，而步入交際場中去，交際之花，總是帶了一個勉强的笑臉，來敷衍你。但是這一個勉强的笑臉，還是瞧在你的那位可以混進交際場的太太的面上，而才裝出來的，若是你已經結婚，而你的太太，是見了面生人，就得面紅耳赤，而終年不踏入交際場的，那麼，你一個人上交際場去，準會枯坐着，沒人來理你。孤另另地，還會給人在你頭上，加一個性情孤僻的頭銜呢。反之，若是你是一位三十餘歲的老處男，嘿，那凖會有無數如花似玉的交際名花，來和你交朋友。在　遊會中，在別個交際場中，絕對的無寂寞之虞。　　我有一位和妻子初離婚的朋友，向一位才和丈夫離婚的婦人，進行着戀愛工作。可是過了不久，那婦人和某一靑年，戀上了，我那朋友氣不過，向那靑年使離間，說伊是再嫁的了。那靑年說，婦人再嫁了，才能懂得體貼丈夫之道呢。我那朋友聽了，眞氣得話都說不出來。近來，聽說他和離婚掉的妻子，破鏡重圓，而誓不再作非分之想。據說他已覺悟着自己，已不是摩登女子心目中的處男了。換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初溫　　國器拿起了茶杯低頭慢慢的呷着茶，似乎在極力賞鑒茶的滋味，一心注意到茶上，這就沒有工夫去答復平山的話。接着平山到上房去搬出四隻彩花博古瓷碟子來，分盛着蜜棗杏脯桃仁榛子仁，擺在桌上，用手指着道：有這樣的好茶，不能不有一點好的下茶的。這一碟杏脯，是北京叭噠嶺的杏子作的，在南方，要算稀罕之物，我不敢獨有，與君共之，我這交情如何？國器笑道：我很感激。叭噠嶺的杏花，我想一定比江南的繁盛。春色滿園關不住，一枝紅杏出墻來。說到這裹，他將右手一個中指，微微的叩着茶杯，作出沉吟的樣子，突然的問道：你所遇到的那位女學生，他家有一棵杏花嗎？平山道：我沒有到過他家裏，這一層我可不知道，你何以有這樣一問。國器笑道：我也不過偶然一問。說着，抓了四五顆桃仁放到面前，一粒一粒的，放到嘴裹去咀嚼。平山道：不嘗一點杏脯嗎？國器笑道：我有一點進一步的要求，這杏脯我心領了，可不可以讓我帶回去，給家母嚐嚐。小山點頭道：你這是一番孝心，我一定從命。這樣看起來，令堂大人立志撫孤，不算白費一番辛苦了。這又說到了我們昨天晚上所說的話了。令堂現在唯一的心願恐怕是要得一位佳婦，早早的抱起孫子來。你旣是要承歡膝下，這一點恐怕是不可緩了。國器自斟了半杯茶慢慢的呷着，呷完了那半杯茶，才笑道：也許有機會，我要娶親的，……說到這裏，女僕捧了一盞燈進來。國器這就起身道：天晚了，家母在家裹等我去吃晚飯呢。你這好茶，今天忽怱一嚐，還沒有過　，明天還在可我再來嗎？平山以爲他是說着玩笑的，笑着答應了。他找出一個紙盒子，把蜜棗杏脯盛了起來，讓國器帶回去。相送到大門口的時候，半鈎新月，掛在墻角的樹梢上，照着深巷裹地上還很白。平山道：今夜月色很好，你還出來嗎？國器道：不出來了，明日我要特别起早。平山道：有什麼事，還要特別起早呢？國器道：沒有什麼事，不過我想把教的功課早預備好，再見罷。他說着，轉身便走，走了幾步，却又回轉身來道：小山兄，我還要問你一句話。你所畫的那副時裝美女，家裹還有草稿子嗎？平山道：沒有草稿子了。你爲什麼這樣惦記那張畫。（二五）江亢虎發起大路社  無私　　大路社是由江亢虎博士領銜發起的，前幾天開了一次茶話會，江博士坐在主席座位，很受到會中五上餘男女同志的注目。他是一個胖子，身上穿一件中國自由呢布的單長衫，團團的臉，鼻架眼鏡，他有一個特徵，走路的時候，左面的肩膊是聳過右肩。有四五個年輕女人，坐在他的旁邊。　　據大路社草案起草人許嘯天報吿，發起大路社的宗旨，是要組織旅行團體，調查民聞疾苦，研究地理風俗。靠旅行去普及平民敎，推動商工實業，改進農村生產建設國防文化。據許君的意見，外國人到中國來旅行，大都是一種侵略，而中國人在自己土地旅行，是一種認識，一種實騐，一種學習。他希望大家節省遊山玩水的精神，去注意探訪民間的疾苦，節省酒肉徵逐的金錢，去多做一點救濟社會的事業　　據說該社取名「大路」的意義，是爲了這是一個流行的新名詞，例如近日續無續電播送的「大路歌」曲，已深入民間，容易使人記取。但發起人中有幾個人，認爲大路取名太抽象，不能其體表現出社的宗旨，而且還有神經過敏的人，認爲是一種含有危險性的名稱，將來或將爲當局取締，在請求登記成立時，恐發生障礙。於是經一部人的提議，要求另行改換另一個絞善的名稱。議論紛紛，各抒高見，新新酒樓的　樓，馬上熱鬧得像是一個雛型的國民大會議塲。　　我們的江主席，平日　有懸口若河的天才，這時他以主席的資格，倒反而弄得束手無策，幾乎要把開會時期無限止的延長下去。他提出了許多名稱，如「生路社」「行路社」「開路社」「先路社」「　路社」等，主張改去了一個「大」字，保留一個「路」字。但是「秀才造反，三年不成」，終於難付表决。最後，由江小鶼提出仍舊維持原來名稱，白費了一小時的辯論，終算把名正言順的社名先解决了。　　最後，由江博士宜布籌備會理事名單時，江博士主張增添女理事二人，一爲女航空師林鵬俠，一爲女敎育家李瑞華，大家鼓掌，一致通過。小春秋週刋燙髮  （霞飛）　　自家兒從來就沒有領敎過，燙髮究竟是好的始終反對燙髮這麼一回事，所以雖然妻也曾在上海住過很久，但至今還是一副鄕下「土老婆」的派兒，不但沒有燙髮，沒有剪髮，甚至連了一點摩登化也沒沾染着。　　但是，現在自己終於支　了一次髮，這雖非我的本意，可總是作了一次違反意志的事情。到如今自己每撫及那曲鬈蓬鬆的頭髮，就覺得萬分赧然！張之洞  蔡蟄存　　張文襄公之洞，字香濤，南皮縣人，晚號抱冰老人，又號無競居士，才華天授，奇肆驚人，品格亦復高潔。年十四，即領本省鄕試解額，厥後聯捷，歷神至學政，轉補巡撫。精精頗異乎人，十數晝夜，目不交睫以爲常，伺候之員弁，更番輪値，尙覺疲憊。惟素性好大喜功，能放不計其能收，可創不思其可繼。中年後鑒於時勢日非，亦曾舉辦新政，嗣又覺變政之非計，因有勸學內外篇刋行，兼有感賦句云，「劉郞不恨多葵麥，祇恨荆榛滿路栽。」讀此可見其懷抱矣。日本婦女之背帶  孫麟昌　　日本女人的背後，終年繫着背囊式的東西，我們中國人見了，往往莫明其妙，都興「葫蘆裏賣的什麼藥」之感。其實那裏面所貯的不過是些海綿罷了。原來日本在武士道時代，人民男多於女，所以姦非之事，層見疊出，女性們佩劍懷刀，以資防衛。但是恐怕被人知道，遂把利錐處於囊中，用帶結在背上。後來日本政治維新，下令禁止佩帶刀劍。可是伊們對於這種背帶的裝束，已經成爲習慣，去了它似乎有失美觀。因此便盛些海綿來代替刀劍。買水  闌删　　粵俗：人死時，其冡子須痛哭捧盆，至附近河或江邊下拜，投下銅錢數文，然後取水少許，謂之「買水」歸爲死者凈面。設其家距有水處過遠，則貯水於盆，就門外哭拜而入，亦謂之「買水」。其僑居上海者，買水多向家中自來水管前行之。　　因有此例，故粵人雅不欲以買水二字連稱，一若此爲最不吉利之語。至江浙婦女，往往信口囑其兒女：「阿囡，去買一個銅板水來！」本屬常事，但在粵人聽來，則總有點「那個」也。民謠  （泥樨）　　結識私情結識廟後頭，廟後頭妮妮有人偷，勿貪你紅來勿貪你白，只貪你眉毛彎彎梳好頭。　　結識私情結職姊妹倆，兩朶鮮花那朶香？蜀葵花開來空長大，木花雖小滿園香。「射」與「矮」  唐增庚　　在我國文字的創製中，往往有許多字是殊為費解的，非但讀音各異，而且意義亦完全相左，這裹，試舉「射」與「矮」二字來闡明：　　「射」，是「身」「寸」之合，身子僅有一寸，豈非成爲「矮」。　　「矮」，是「矢」「委」之合，我們試以「矢委」二字讀切音，豈非是「射」，而且「矢」明明是代表箭，所以「矮」字應讀作「射」，解釋亦應是「射」。　　舉上所述，「射」與「矮」二字，在今日的應用中，却讀音和解釋，是完全適得其反，而且是張冠李戴，古人造字的費解，從這小小的她方亦可以看得出來的。坐監  （承昭）　　父：寳兒，你一路上遠見校旗在空中飄揚時，有什麼感想？　　兒：爹爹，我想又要像「坐監」一般了。　　父：哦，……</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言時裝表演  劍平　　現在是春夏交界，因爲時節更序，而衣服的換季却是每一個人都注意到的。用以作點綴大都會的繁榮的貴族婦人或小姐們，在這時候是最形活動的。據說，有了這一流人物，都市也就繁榮了，景氣也可以回復了。　　因此，依上海也是世界繁榮都會之一的理由，這樣的點綴大都會的工作實在也着實需要的。這也就是「時裝表演」在近日流行一時的原因。不久之前的先施公司和永安公司同時舉行的時裝表演只不過是爲了小資產者的需要而設備的，現在一家外國的百貨公司却有點兩樣了。某報記載這一時裝表演，在標題上是感慨系之地寫上兩句警惕語—「一件普通旗袍料，貴於一担米」。由此，可見這時裝表演中所陳列時裝的窮奢極侈。　　說到奢侈，又得引伸至—「非奢侈不足以表示繁榮」這一句話了。是的。世界上有什末一個繁榮區域不是生活享受極好的。不過，問題是在於這繁榮是不是表面的。如果一切繁榮只不過是浮面的，而骨子裹只是窮困，飢餓災荒，犯罪，失業，流行時疫。那末，這奢侈却反足以戕殺了這都市的，或者更擴展點說這社會的，這國家的壽命。歸根究底，要景氣的回復，和使商業都市，或工廠農場等再次繁榮，那辦法是决不在窮奢極侈這上面的。換句話說，决不是窮奢極侈便可以繁榮都市的，反之，只有從量基本的問題，如復興工業，解放薪工勞働者，等等，才有辦法使整個社會經濟機構合理化，繁榮和景氣才有希望。只有這樣，才可以得到眞正的生活享受。假使反因爲果，這失敗的結論是可以現在便引實例决定了的。　　總之，時裝表演是一種都市刺戟的花樣，或者更澈底地說，是一般的寄生職業者，為了推銷他們的貨品，以引誘一般富有的貴族走上窮奢極侈的道路。一件普通的旗袍貴於一担米，未必會更奇怪於一雙高跟鞋等於一個小職員二個月的薪金的。這是都市不景氣的氛圍畸形的產物。這，也更是這不合理的社會下更不合理的事情。看相（下）  期全　　最後一句話好像他的私語，說過後，他凝視着窗外，彷彿思索的樣子。才慢慢地凑緊來低聲問：「兩位先生貴庚…？」　　我的朋友似乎已經忘了相對坐着的那位是相面先生，爽直了回答他「二十四歲。」　　「是。是。」他又恢復了瀟洒的樣子，「我猜至多二十五歲。是。二十四歲。」這時候，他的手撫弄着手杖上的老虎頭，全神貫注在我朋友的面上，半饗：「先生不要動氣，君子問禍不問福，照先生的面相上看來倒是福相，不過從去年：二十三到二十八做事不順手，有奸人暗算。一直…三十五…四十八…後福無窮。嘻嘻，不是我看相的拍馬屁，先生將來做了中央委員，還要到廟裹來訪問我賽諸葛呢！嘻嘻。」　　他從衣袖裏授出一方玻璃的招牌來，賽諸葛神相，談流年小洋兩角，細談終身大洋一元，他就指着最後一行：「先生兩毛錢小意思。我實在看見先生的面相好，奉送終身。嘻嘻，靈不靈，先生以後再相信我賽諾葛吧。」　　朋友打發那官派十足的賽諸葛走後，他說那兩毛錢是被騙去的。於是我又想起那位穿中山裝的看相，他太不懂說假話的藝術，雖然他用可憐相從我這裹受到兩毛錢，但是人與入之問到底還是用虛偽，欺騙來系述着關係的。我看着賽諸葛搖擺着他的官派十足的台步向另一個茶客走去時，覺得他是個偉大的英雄！父親  白玲　　時間像飛一般的消逝了。　　繫在我的心上，是一串回憶的綫索。　　我永遠不會忘記三年前的一個春天。灰霧瀰漫着的陰鬱的黃昏。　　像往日一樣的，我同弟弟，妹妹們照例要在六點鐘，站在門口等候着工作完了的父親的歸來。但今天意外的，已經七點鐘敲過了，還未見父親回到家來。我們向馬路的遠處望，望不見一點什麼，除了走近我們面前幾個用黑布遮蓋着頭部的工人外，黃包車幾乎也不容易看到幾部。路燈在霧影中射着暗淡的光芒。一切，都是沉在潮濕的濃霧裹。　　這時，母親像有點焦急了的樣子，也走出門口向一條灰濛濛的霧街張望着。　　「從來還沒有這樣一次呢。」母親說着，便對我這麼說：「你同湘弟到海濱那條路上去看看，也許是給霧迷失了路吧。」　　「那能，難道父親還和小孩子一樣嗎？這不是笑話，不會，不會的。怕有別的事情發生吧。」　　母親加倍地急迫了。　　於是，我帶着湘弟，兩個人在發滑的被霧淋濕的馬路上走動着，向父親每日必須經過的那一條靠近海邊的太平路走去了。　　和湘弟呆呆的坐在海岸的鐵欄杆上。澎湃的海水，跳動地，發出一陣一陣驚人的聲音來。浪花不時的向岸上翻射一直濺到我們的身上。橋上沒有一個行人，四週是陰冷地。湘弟像是怕冷似的緊緊地，靠近了我。　　「走吧，姐，恐怕父親從別的路上已經回家了吧。」　　於是，我們又踏着原路走回家去。　　走進了家，我覺得家開始寂寞了。　　我看見面帶愁容的父親，像托着一個病身子，頽然地在靠近窗戶的一把椅子上。在他臉上找不出一絲笑，他只是朝着我和湘弟看，我覺得他的發黯的眼光，不住地在我的臉上，來回的搖晃。接着，他用着異常低沉的聲音，對我說　　「我已經回來了……」　　我悄悄地走近了另一個屋子去，我看見母親正在屋裹擦着眼淚，在她身旁的小弟弟，只是用兩只小手掣着母親的衣角。　　「母親，父親爲什麼這樣憂愁？而你又爲什要哭呢？」　　我實在忍耐不住了。　　「你父親被停職了，局子裹嫌他年紀大……」母親很傷心的說。　　聽了母親的話，我心裏突然震蕩起來。我的血管都在炸裂了。　　我心裹想：父親的被停職，難道是眞爲了他的年紀大嗎？不，父親才四十八歲，但是局子裏，像父親那樣的年紀不是很多的嗎？這時我却想到父親的被停職，完全是由於他的固執的忠誠的性子害了他的。在這狡滑與欺詐的人羣裏，是不需要像父親那樣人的。我知道父親的個性太過於剛强，寧肯他在家裹挨餓，也不會跑到人家跟前，用着乞憐的樣子，去討人家的好。因此，父親除了辦他自己所應該辦的公事之外，他是什麼也不去管。他從不願意同那些新近跟局長進來的人們來來往往。　　這一晚，父親是陷於悲憤與愁惱之中。對於全家七口人的生活，父親覺得這是一件可怕而難解决的事。但我們竟用着許多的話，極力的慰勸他。　　夜深了。我在朦朧中還聽着母親的泣哭，父親的嘆息。　　第二天的早上，父親獨自離開了我們便到C城去了。</p>

<p>初夏  秦淮　　去年五月，我負着生活鞭笞的創傷從天津流到大連，每晚在浪速町的夜市里徘徊，像失掉了靈魂似的，憂鬱而且悲哀。這是多麼生疏的地方啊！一個陌生人在這里尋找同情是再困難沒有的了　　這都市到處洒遍了殖民的奴隸的被宰割的血跡！被壓逼出來的奴隸們的慘痛呼聲，跟海濤一般的怒吼着，氣憤一條綫穿着奴隸們的心，殖民地的命脈震動着！我被這些悽慘的景象刺痛了心，忿怒在胸中燃燒，然而一種沉重的東西壓住了我的心頭，甚至連呼吸都有些吃力了。　　流浪，在碼頭上，街市里，我拖着長瘦的結飢餓乾枯了的身子在逛蕩。一天我踏着黃昏從海岸回歸市里，不料半路上碰到了一個遠親，雖然我是那麼狼狽的樣子，他還認得我，當他握我的手時我饗乎戰抖了！同樣他也驚奇着，閃着疑惑之光的眼睛，不時的掃視我，我羞怯，默默的跟他到他的木廠里，從此我便是這木廠里工人們的朋友了，他們給了我最大的同情。　　那位遠親，我呌他三表叔，人是極其和靄的，他是這木廠的老板，然而　木廠却是外國入出錢開的，他問了我許多話，起先他有意要資備我，後來他憐憫我，他說我受磨難太深了，斷定我將來會找到生活出路，而且他在留心替我謀個職業。　　「給外國人做事你願意嗎？」　　我向他點了點頭，表示願意，實在我對於　業的需要是非常迫切，多麼渴望得到工作啊！流浪最容易殺傷人的。　　無意中他提及我們故鄕人劉樹華，他說這人現在沙河口一家雅片館裏管燈（註。給烟客擺烟燈，烟槍者）說話的意思好像不願我見到那人，對於幹雅片館這行生意的人他都　不起。　　劉樹華從小跟我很要好，旣然他也在大連街上，我爲何不去看看他，等到商得三表叔的同意，就在一天午後，我們坐上馬車，從山城町一直到沙河口去了，初夏的陽光撒在馬路上，留聲機放送着「大和民族」的歌聲，花汗傘下的艷裝美女，身上噴出脂粉和花露水的香氣，　人的都市之街啊！　　在一家門前掛着「遠香樓雅片小賣所」的招牌的舖子前，我們的馬車站住了，下車一進門就看見了樹華，他吃驚的看着我，又是羞愧又是歡欣的和我握手，他安置我們坐下，倒過茶就抽空去給客人擺燈，安槍，客人少了他就過來坐下給我們說話兒。樣子顯然是向我們抱歉：　　「你們千萬別見怪，身子賣給人家就由不得自己！我幹這沒出息的事你會笑話咱，唉！有什麼法子，飯總歸要吃的，不幹不成別的事情那能到咱門下，唉！唉！」　　衣衫襤褸沒有血色的人，不斷的走進來，半死不活的一頭跌倒床上，打着哈欠，又是鼻涕又是淚，喉嚨像乾癟了，聲音都出不順流，滿屋像躺了一些受傷的老獸匹。慢慢的烟燈擺來，烟槍在燈頭上茲茲的嚮着，靑烟從鼻孔里冒出，屋里充滿着烟霧快活開始在烟客身上發酵了。笛聲，口哨，各種各腔的小調，甚麼離奇古怪的聲音全有，更有吹牛皮的，先說自己過五關斬六將，精神活現，彷彿這世界祇有他自己是英雄。這羣可憐見地的奴隸們，他們給人家麻醉了，暗暗地殺害了。我不忍在那里久留，加之樹華又忙得不能分身，我們便吿辭。回家在馬車上，三表叔對我說：　　「大連市共有二百七十多家烟館，吃烟的都是中國人。平常商人交往，也要用雅片招待，要是來了客人，主人不帶他到雅片館去抽幾口，他會生氣的。假如調查一下，全大連的中國人不會吸雅片是太少太少了。」　　馬車走到西崗時，我瞥見一處「戒烟所」，我驚異的問表叔：　　「外國人旣然開雅片館怎麼又設「戒烟所」呢？」　　「他們的手段毒得很，用雅片毒你，到你不能救苦時，再用憐惜來撈中國人的好兒，早有好多人唸外國人的好處，「你們瞧入家外國人多好，戒烟不要一個錢，還供吃喝。」　　回到木廠，工人們說剛才有刑事（註：卽偵探）來打聽，有沒有閒散人？　　三表叔着慌了：　　「我實在不敢再留你住　，刑事是專跟你們這種人爲難，你乘早離開這兒吧？」　　當夜我被三表叔送上去烟台的輪船，第二天我又在烟台開始流浪了。往事  費斯東　　我常常記起小學時代的一個同學，呌做阿典的，因爲他是窮得繳不起學費，穿了破鞋子上學的可同情的人物。他生得很粗野，但是却受着人家的欺負；我類得見到他起過一次反抗。有一次，被一個土豪的兒子用最刻薄的話訕笑了他，結果他還是偸偸地在牆壁間哭了一塲了事。在旁邊看着的我忍不住了，曾經這樣地問過他：　　「你爲什麼老是這樣懦怯？越是這樣，人家就越來欺負你，知道麼？」　　「怎麼不知道！」他揩着眼哭，回答我：「要不是在學校里，你看我不一拳把這傢伙打跌地下去。祇是在學校里，要是我打了他，恐怕不知道會引來怎樣的災禍。唉，我的學費到現在還沒有交，先生巴不得有個機會開除我呢。」　　那時候我們差一年就可以畢業了。阿興接着又向我說：　　「我的母親沒有一天不叮嚀我：吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人！她的意思我完全白你；所以我不能做出對不住她的事來。再過一年就好了，我注定了不能到中學去，那時我就可以找點什麼做，來養活我的母親了。」　　阿興的環境非常可憐。三歲的那一年，父親在一塲傷寒症的威迫之下死去了。遺下一間破房子，給他們母子遮風蓋雨；此外是什麼也沒有。於是這孤單的寡婦把撫育孤兒的責任負担起來，受盡了痛苦，還送他進學校去，一直到現在。我能够想像得到她對於阿興的期望，所以也就對這一對母子同情起來，不說什麼了。　　阿興的功課是做得很好的，特別對於圖畫，他很有天才：用最廉的紙張和鉛筆，他常常能畫出一張極好的山水來。可是，敎圖畫的先生並不喜歡他；表示着厭惡；不去指導他。對於這些阿興都不介意，仍然很用功地畫着。我向他稱讚那圖盡的好處時，他就報給我一個感激的微笑。　　是春雨連綿的一天，上完了課，放學回家時已經將近黃昏時節了。我們走着泥濘的路，撑着雨傘。阿與是連一把傘也沒有的，把破報紙蓋着腦袋：但是這沒有用，雨已經打濕了他的衣衫，他很愛惜那對鞋子，特地從脚上脫了下來，用一隻手提着。另一隻手提着書包。這時那土豪的兒子又跟上來了，故意地把洋傘流下的水滴到阿興的頭上去：又從地上濺起污獨的水花，直將他的褲子又濕又髒。我看着這情景，走過阿興那里去，靠近他走，想來這樣阿興總不致於再受到他的欺負了吧。同行的孩子們對於那土豪的兒子的惡作劇都一致表示憎惡了，可是那壞傢伙還是顯出一副猙獰的神氣，忽然又閃過來，用脚把阿興手里的書包踢向路旁的泥潭里去。　樣，阿興再也不能忍耐了，把那對鞋子呌我拿着，衝上前去一聲不饗就餉了那壞傢伙一學。　　「怎麼，你敢打人？你……」那一個着慌了，睜着光大的眼睛，撲向阿興的身上去。　　兩個孩子扭打着，在雨中，泥水四濺着。阿興的强勁一下子就把那土豪的兒子打得差點跌進泥潭里，狼狽地逃了。一邊逃，一邊呌着：　　「我吿訴爸爸去！我一定吿訴爸爸去！」　　是的，第二天，我到學校里去時，就看見開除阿興的佈吿。垂着腦袋，紅着眼睛，阿興從敎務室里走將出來。這里的學校也操縱在土豪的手里，那些先生們都不過是土豪的爪牙。那時候我年紀小，除了替阿興表同情之外，什麼也不知道了。後來聽說阿興在縣城里一家印刷店當學徒，兩年以後我到城里去唸中學時也遇到過他一次。鄕村的情形一天一天地改變了，我離開那里也整整有了十年。阿興如何一定還活着吧，至於他的母親可不敢脫了。敎育原來是權勢者所專有的，窮孩子如阿興，共被排除，如今看來，是一點也用不着驚怪的咧。代郵　　雷石榆先生：本刋無稿酬單寄奉。每月六日至十日，十六日至二十日（星期日除外）下午二時至四時，請開明篇名及刊載日期，加蓋印章，向本館會計處領取可也。　　馬孟宗先生：要退還稿件，郵資請附於原函內，能附開好地址之信封更好播音　　上海市各界追悼公祭中常會主席胡展堂先生，全滬廣播電台停止娛樂節目播音劇本蘇州人（七）  顧文宗作　　麗雅　小學生的知識那也保持不到大學生呀！　　驚鴻　小學是人的基本敎育，怎麼可以一到大學；就忘了自己的基本敎育呢？沒有基本敎育的根底，又怎麼能負起敎育兒女的使命呢？旣然不能敎育未來的中國主人翁，那那兒能振興中國頽廢的民族呢？中國的民族旣然不能振興，蘇州人還不是永遠的蘇州人嗎？　　麗雅　好了，好了！我懂了，我懂了！　　驚鴻　你懂了，我知道你現在懂了，而且你也會說了，但是我們不能光是懂了，會說了，就算完事了，我們旣是懂了，我們就該懂個澈底，我們旣是會說，我們就得會做，會說得出，做得到，那才是眞正的努力奮鬥的人呢，假如嘴上老會說，事情不去做同，那仍舊是等死的廢物！　　麗雅　謝謝你這誠懇的敎訓，希望明天的蘇州人；不再是今天這樣軟弱無能的蘇州人啦！　　效果　隔着房門，可以聽見機器間　撥動　岸時的引擎聲，同時又有細微的「方向指示多多」的響聲，更有　錨時引擎放鍊下水的聲音。　　茶房　（遠而近地喊着）到了大沽口了！船已經到了大沽口啦！諸位客人，預備下船吧！（打門聲）沈小姐，船已經到了大沽口了，您預備下船吧。　　效果　（開門，外面噪雜之聲突然聽得格外淸楚，間或有小工們扛抬貨物的喊聲，　唷　吭唷！時時地鑽進了耳鼓。）　　驚鴻　Miss金，您不去歸着您的行李嗎？　　麗雅　我有小雲兒給我看管呢，我想稍微靜一靜再下船，這種亂哄哄的樣子，眞叫人看了頭疼！您沒有人帮您管行李嗎？　　驚鴻　這沒有甚麼怪，這祗是次殖民地的中國民族通有的現象罷了，我所笑的，像你這樣的中國人；爲甚麼那麼多？　　麗雅　唉！Miss沈，請你爽快的吿訴我好不好？究竟是怎麼一回事啊？　　驚鴻　事情是很簡單的，旣然你不明白，我就多吿訴你一點兒也好，「和平，奮鬥，救中國，」這是孫中山先生臨終的時候兒；在他的嘴唇邊兒，用微弱的氣息；送達出來的三句遺言，這三句遺言，要我們這些醉生夢死的中國人，快快地醒過來，要用奮鬥的精神，求取和平，非得達到了和平的目的，才能救我們這</p>

<h3>The Difficulties of the British Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The British Conservative Party cabinet under the leadership of Baldwin is now in a state of unease because it is encountering unprecedented difficulties. The so-called unprecedented difficulties can be divided into two aspects: foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>The first foreign difficulty is the issue of Italy. The struggle between Britain and Italy for hegemony in East Africa and the Mediterranean is constant. Mussolini, after the Italian army occupied Addis Ababa, declared Abyssinia as an Italian territory, thereby demanding that Britain withdraw its troops stationed in Abyssinia, implicitly wiping out its interests in Abyssinia. At the same time, Mussolini's ambition has not ended. He still cannot forget the occupation of Albania and the hegemony of the Mediterranean Sea, which makes Britain feel an supreme threat to its hegemony in East Africa and the Mediterranean. The second is the issue of Germany. The Conservative Party's foreign policy towards Germany has always been very tolerant, but Germany's entry into the Rhineland has posed a very serious threat to Britain, which uses the Rhineland as its defense line. Recently, although it has raised questions and criticized Germany, Germany has not only been slow to respond, but has also proposed the restoration of its former colonies. Britain has acquired the most in Germany's former colonies, so the proposal of this request makes it difficult for Britain to tolerate it any further. Finally, there is the issue of the reorganization of the League of Nations. Baldwin wants to reorganize the League of Nations because the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy have failed. However, although the League of Nations cannot effectively prevent the aggression of aggressors in fact, it is still seen by the general public as a tool to contain aggressors. At the same time, Britain currently needs France's help in its diplomacy, and France wants to maintain the League of Nations, which inevitably puts Baldwin in a dilemma.</p>
<p>The first domestic difficulty is the anti-British movement in the colonies. The infighting between Jews and Arabs in Palestine has now turned into an Arab movement against British rule. The Arab Higher Committee has long decided to strike, close markets, and refuse to pay all taxes to resist British rule and oppression. Although the British heavy troops and aircraft are still suppressing it, the Arab anti-British liberation movement has not only not been eliminated, but has become increasingly high-pitched. The second is the leakage of the budget content. In order to expand its military preparations, the Baldwin cabinet has to increase taxes and increase the burden on the people. When the British House of Commons passed the budget last month, Baldwin was attacked by the opposition. The increased tax items included income tax and tea tax. Before the tax increase was passed in the House of Commons, the news of the tax increase had already spread, leading to speculation and profiteering. Yesterday, Colonial Secretary Thomas resigned because of suspicion of leaking the news, but this inevitably tarnishes the official conduct of the Baldwin cabinet.</p>
<p>Now, Baldwin's cabinet is likely to be reorganized because it cannot overcome these difficulties. However, it may not be easy to overcome these difficulties after the reorganization.</p>
<h3>The Huge US Navy Budget</h3>
<p>Joint Conference of the Two Houses Reaches a Compromise Plan, Speeding Up Shipbuilding and Increasing the Navy Personnel to 100,000</p>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department previously submitted a budget proposal for the 1936-37 fiscal year in February of this year (starting from July 1st of this year). The required funding totaled $549,591,000, an increase of $67,000,000 compared to the previous budget. The House of Representatives and the Senate have successively revised and passed it. Because the opinions failed to reach an agreement, it was submitted to the Joint Committee of the Two Houses for discussion. The committee has recently reached a compromise plan, stipulating that the navy's funding is $526,000,000. Although it is more than 20 million yuan less than the original plan, it is still the largest budget in peacetime. Its use is to build 12 destroyers and 6 submarines, continue to build 84 other warships, and stipulate that if other signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty build battleships, President Roosevelt may order the construction of two battleships. In addition, it also advocates the construction of 333 aircraft and increasing the number of naval personnel from 93,500 to 100,000. This compromise plan will be submitted to Congress for a vote next week. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Increases Cruiser Tonnage, Japan Submits a Reply</h3>
<p>Before the London Naval Treaty Expires, This Request is Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the consultation between the Navy and Foreign Ministries regarding the British government's request to increase cruisers and destroyers by a total of 40,000 tons, it was decided to submit a formal reply. Foreign Minister Arita instructed Fujii, the acting ambassador to the United Kingdom, to submit this reply to the British government on the 23rd. The content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Even if the provisions stipulated in the London Naval Treaty lose their effectiveness at the end of this year, we still feel that they should be observed. Therefore, the British government's request to incorporate Class A cruisers into Class B cruisers and increase training ships raises doubts about the above spirit.</p>
<p>However, in practical terms, the disposal of the treaty overage (Japan 60,000 tons, Britain and the United States approximately 100,000 tons) should take appropriate response from the perspective of financial national defense. If we leave the treaty to conduct consultations, we have the intention to approve it. (24th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British-Russian Naval Negotiations, Reaching an Agreement Depends on Two Factors</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A Russian newspaper today published an article by Latake, saying that the agreement in the naval negotiations between Britain and Russia depends on two factors: 1. Germany agrees to conclude the same treaty with Britain. 2. Regarding the reservations in the Far East, the Soviet Russia is eager to establish a naval restriction agreement with Japan, but has not yet had any effect. Before this agreement is established, Soviet Russia cannot bind itself and recognize the qualitative restrictions of the Far East Fleet, or inform about the strength of the Russian fleet in the Far East. As for the qualitative restrictions in Europe, they are naturally not hindered by the reservations in the Far East, because the Russian Far East Fleet cannot affect the relative strength of the European Navy.

<h3>Japanese Goods Meet Obstacles Everywhere, Japan Decides to Retaliate</h3>
<p>Continue to Dump Large Quantities to the United States, Restrict Imports of Australian Products</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese officials and merchants have generally decided on their attitude towards the United States and Australia increasing the import tax on Japanese cotton cloth. That is, before the new tax rate takes effect on June 20, a large amount of exports will be carried out to the United States for hoarding. After June 20, dumping will continue regardless of cost to compete with American goods. On the Australian side, a "permission system" is planned to restrict the import of Australian wool and wheat to Japan and Manchuria as retaliation. (24th Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the interruption of the negotiations between Japan and Australia on trade and the breakdown of the negotiations between Japan and the United States on cotton cloth, Foreign Minister Arita has decided to move towards opening up relations in all aspects. Because there is no way to avoid launching the Trade Protection Law against Australia, once the content of the Australian government's decision to increase tariffs is clarified, Foreign Minister Arita will take various domestic procedures for the sake of protecting Japan's trade rights. What kind of retaliatory measures will be taken against Australia's wool, wheat, etc., and request the cooperation of the people. Regarding relations with the United States, take the statement of Director Hull's free trade policy as a reason to promote the United States' reflection, and adjust the trilateral trade between Japan, which has joined South America, and North and South America from a general perspective. It is hoped that Ambassador Kurusu, who recently took office in Belgium, will provide lateral cooperation in the United States. Regarding relations with the Dutch East Indies, the passage of the Navigation Control Law is expected to be certain, and preparations for the resumption of the shipping conference have been completed, so Consul General Nishizawa is ordered to make unremitting efforts to establish Japan's economic southward policy. Therefore, from the perspective of the Trade Protection Law, under the contact between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the private sector will also cooperate to strive to overcome the difficulties. (24th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The cotton spinning industry in Lancashire is very satisfied to hear the news that the Australian government announced in the House of Representatives that it would issue a new tax rule and adopt an import license system to benefit the best customers. It is expected that after the implementation of the new tax rule, the cotton goods imported by Australia, which are currently supplied by Japan, will be replaced by British goods, and the annual trade will increase by about one million pounds. The chairman of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce said that the Australian government's move is a genuine effort to achieve a fairer distribution of British-Japanese textile trade.

<h3>Japan's Special Parliament Extended to Today</h3>
<p>Important Bills All Passed</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the cabinet meeting on the 24th, in order to expect the bills submitted to be successfully established, the government decided to extend the session of the parliament by one day, until the 25th, and announced it in the official gazette that day. (24th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today is the last day of the 69th extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet. All the motions proposed by the government, political parties, or individual members of parliament, a total of more than 60 items, have been mostly reviewed and completed during the previous meetings. The so-called three important bills that the government is anxious about (namely the Unstable Document Control Law, the Retirement Savings Law, and the General Mobilization Secret Protection Law) will also be discussed and merged at today's meeting. In addition to the General Mobilization Bill, the other two bills were amended and passed. Therefore, both the upper and lower houses and the government have been extremely nervous this morning, and today's meeting may have to be extended to a deeper time, so the closing ceremony may not be held. (24th Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers reopened its meeting at 8:18 PM on the 23rd and submitted the Taiwan Colonization Law. Chairman Yanagihara reported on the deliberation process and results of the committee, saying that the amendments made by the House of Representatives to the articles on the supervision rights of the Colonization Corporation and the appointment of staff members raised doubts in the wording, so the government's original plan was still adopted. As a result of the vote, the government's original plan was approved according to the chairman's report, and it was handed over to the House of Representatives. The meeting adjourned at 9:26. (24th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives held a plenary session at 11:00 AM on the 24th. Regarding the Taiwan Colonization Corporation Bill, the Speaker designated nine members, including Yongai Ryutaro, to attend the joint committee of the two houses. Next, the Retirement Provident Fund Bill was put on the agenda, with questions and answers, and the discussion was extended to the afternoon. Rest at 0:45. (24th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Reorganization Preparations, Activities of Conservative Party Extremists</h3>
<p>(London) After the resignation of Colonial Secretary Thomas, members of the three parties (namely the Conservative Party, the National Liberal Party, and the National Labor Party) by which the National Government is organized are about to actively conduct talks in order to determine the successor. It is said that the extremists of the Conservative Party are very eager for this seat, so their activities are also the strongest. The members of the party, namely Lord Windtown, the former Secretary of State for India, are scheduled to hold a grand banquet at the Sule City Villa at the end of this week. Important figures of the Conservative Party, such as former Foreign Secretary Sir Chamberlain, Sir Burke Crawford, and Sir Clegg (Burke and Clegg are both extreme party members), have been invited to participate. People are paying close attention to this banquet, because Lord Windtown originally had the hope of succeeding the Colonial Secretary. In addition, Conservative Party leader Churchill will return to Beijing tonight to meet with former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain. Political figures are also paying great attention to this move, because the two have recently made speeches in the House of Commons criticizing the policies pursued by Prime Minister Baldwin, so their positions have become closer to each other. As for the National Liberal Party, according to what our reporter knows, they are also trying hard to have Mr. Bailey, the Minister of Transportation who belongs to the party, succeed as the Colonial Secretary. Since taking charge of transportation, Mr. Bailey has taken various measures to greatly reduce traffic accidents on the streets, so he has gained the love of public opinion. As for the National Labor Party, although it wants to do its best to maintain the original number of seats for its party members (there are four cabinet members in the party, namely Thomas, Privy Councilor MacDonald, Overseas Autonomous Territory Minister Malcolm MacDonald, and Labor Minister Brown), there are only ten members of the party in the House of Commons, and their power is weak, so it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve their wish. According to Thomas, he submitted his resignation on Wednesday this week (May 20), and the Prime Minister approved it the next day, but it was not announced until yesterday. Why is this? Political figures are surprised. Or it is said that the Prime Minister wants to go to Gez Villa at the end of this week for a break, so that he can calmly arrange to solve the difficult problems and maintain the organization of the National Cabinet. It is also possible that the announcement of Thomas' resignation has been postponed. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>King of England, Mingchun, to be Crowned; Officially Announced This Thursday</h3>
<p>(London) According to the "Sunday Express," the coronation date for King Edward VIII has been set for March 27th of next year and will be officially announced next Thursday (the 28th of this month). (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Buckingham Palace to be Converted into a Park, Sold for Three Million Pounds</h3>
<p>(London) "Reynolds News" recently reported that Buckingham Palace and its associated buildings are rumored to be sold for three million pounds, to be used for constructing new buildings and creating a park. Back when the late King George V was alive, he had considered selling Buckingham Palace due to the area being crowded with shops and offices. Now that King Edward VIII has ascended the throne, he also prefers to reside at St. James's Palace, where he lived as Crown Prince, and does not wish to move into Buckingham Palace. A company here intends to purchase the palace and undertake the reconstruction project. Once this becomes a reality, the term "St. James's Palace," which originally represented the British royal family, will regain its original meaning and be more deserving of the name.

<h3>Future French Premier Negotiates Cabinet Formation</h3>
<p>(Paris) The future Premier of the Cabinet, Léon Blum, continued discussions with various parties on the left today to negotiate the formation of the cabinet. He successively met with Minister of Justice Daladier (a member of the Radical Socialist Party), Communist Party leaders Doré and Duguet, and also visited Speaker of the House Buisson. Afterwards, according to Daladier's announcement to the press, his meeting with Léon Blum did not touch on the distribution of cabinet seats in the future cabinet. (According to reports, after the former leader of the Radical Socialist Party, Herriot, declined to take on the position of Foreign Minister, some people have mentioned that Daladier is being considered to fill that position.) The two Communist Party leaders met with Léon Blum for an hour and a half, presenting their party's views, stating that the future cabinet's policy direction should prioritize the following four items: Namely, implementing large-scale projects to alleviate unemployment, allocating 1 billion francs as funding for childcare services, establishing a dedicated department for national defense to handle national defense issues, and issuing a general amnesty. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>French Royalist Newspaper Defames Socialist Leader</h3>
<p>Accused of Inciting Murder; General Manager Sentenced to Eight Months</p>
<p>(Paris) The general manager of the royalist newspaper "Action Française," Maurras, has recently published articles in the newspaper, greatly defaming Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party. He has also commented on sanctions and war issues. Recently, the minor crime court sentenced him to eight months in prison for publicly inciting murder, with no possibility of parole. During the interrogation, Maurras confessed, "I have always held a strong desire to avoid war, but Léon Blum, the future Premier of the Cabinet, actually supports sanctions against Italy. The result of this will be a fratricidal war between the two major Latin nations. This is why I am attacking Léon Blum. If my threat to harm Léon Blum's life could prevent war, then I would thank God." After the court session, members of the Communist Party sang the Internationale in the courthouse corridor, leading to a conflict with Maurras's followers. There were also demonstrations in the streets, but order was restored thanks to the police suppression. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Trade with China: Imports Change to Exports</h3>
<p>(Berlin) In the first three months of this year, the value of German exports to China was 31,100,000 marks, while the value of goods imported from China was 29,400,000 marks, resulting in a total surplus of 1,700,000 marks. In the same period of 1933, German trade with China was in deficit, with the value of goods exported to China at 20,700,000 marks and the value of imported goods at 50,600,000 marks, resulting in a total deficit of 29,900,000 marks. Since then, the amount of the deficit has gradually decreased, until this year when it has turned into a surplus. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Fierce Competition in the World Market: Chinese Tea Plummets</h3>
<p>From First Place to Sixth Place; Russian Tea Now Self-Sufficient</p>
<p>Foreign press reports that for many centuries, China's tea exports have consistently ranked first in the world. Its flourishing tea production and exquisite tea processing are indeed exceptional. Its reputation is well-deserved. However, in recent years, due to intense competition in the world market and the impact of economic recession, China's tea industry has suffered a precipitous decline. In recent years, China's tea exports have clearly been declining, and according to recent statistics, Chinese tea leaves have fallen to sixth place among tea-producing countries.</p>
<p>In addition to India, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, and Japan, another competitor with Chinese tea is Russia. Russia was originally a good customer of Chinese tea, but in recent years, Russian tea has largely become self-sufficient. (French Industrial News)</p>

<h3>Famous French Female Aviator Hilsz Has an Accident</h3>
<p>Off the Southwest Coast of Sweden; Plane Destroyed, Head Injured</p>
<p>Stockholm: The famous French aviator, Ms. Hilsz, who had twice passed through Shanghai when flying from Paris to Tokyo, arrived here today with her pilot, Mr. Robet, planning to perform an aerial show at the newly built Bromma Airport. Unexpectedly, she had an accident in Gothenburg, on the southwest coast of Sweden. The aircraft was almost completely destroyed, and both suffered head injuries. They have been hospitalized for treatment. Ms. Hilsz, 33 years old, was the first French woman to obtain a license to fly military aircraft. In 1929, she obtained her pilot's license. In 1930, she flew from France to Vietnam and then back, covering a distance of 16,780 miles. In the spring of 1932, she flew from Paris to Madagascar in Africa and then back. Her greatest achievement was setting a record of 5 days, 20 hours, and 13 minutes from Paris to Hanoi. In the spring of 1933, she made a flight to Shanghai and Tokyo, and the following year she made another flight, reducing the record between Paris and Hanoi. Ms. Hilsz was not satisfied with long-distance flying and engaged in high-altitude flying. On August 19, 1932, she reached an altitude of 32,090 feet at the Villacoublay airfield, setting a high-altitude record for female aviators. On June 17, 1935, she reached an altitude of 38,713 feet, almost 10,000 feet higher than the world's highest peak, Mount Everest (29,141 feet). (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Belgian House of Representatives Re-Election</h3>
<p>Proportional Representation Adopted; Intense Competition Among Parties</p>
<p>Brussels: The election for the Belgian House of Representatives is scheduled for tomorrow, and the results will be revealed on Wednesday (27th). There are 1,124 candidates participating in the election. The electoral system adopts proportional representation. According to the constitution, one representative can be elected for every 40,000 residents. Therefore, the new House of Representatives will have 202 seats, while the current House has 187 seats, including 79 seats for the Catholic Party, 73 seats for the Socialist Party, 24 seats for the Liberal Party, and 3 seats for the Communist Party. The remaining eight seats currently belong to the new political party called the "Rex Party," which will begin campaigning tomorrow. Most of its members are Catholic Party members, but its leader, Degrelle, criticizes the politicians of the Catholic Party as being outdated and fiercely attacks the collusion between financial and political figures. The leaders of the Catholic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Liberal Party accuse the "Rex Party" of attempting to establish a dictatorship. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Economic Essays</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor: Tang Qingzeng</p>
<p>Financial Problems in Times of Emergency (Part 2) by Ma Yinchu</p>
<p>The Weakness and Concentrated Danger of China's Financial Resources</p>
<p>What applies to other countries may not apply uniformly to China. Throughout Chinese history, "storing wealth among the people" has been considered good governance, so the wealth of the people should be considerable. However, the savings accumulated by the people in the past are mostly in the form of cash, stored deep in cellars, which is of little use in wartime. As for other material resources, the largest concentration is in Shanghai. Financial concentration in Shanghai is undeniable. Other things like bank deposits, real estate investments, bidding transactions, and prize-winning savings are all centered in Shanghai, and continue to absorb wealth at extremely high interest rates. Currently, bank deposits in Shanghai amount to 2.1 billion yuan, and the amount of banknotes issued is 450 million yuan, all of which can be regarded as representatives of the nation's material resources. Their reserves are also concentrated in Shanghai. Once war breaks out, Shanghai will be a must-seize location for the enemy. If it is captured, the reserves will be monitored and cannot be freely deployed. Deposits and banknotes will immediately become worthless paper. The scope of paper currency circulation is very wide, and even peddlers and porters have banknotes. If the banknotes become worthless paper and cannot be used to buy things, wouldn't the hearts of the people across the country be filled with panic? If the people in the rear are panicked, how can the soldiers at the front have the courage to fight? Therefore, when I gave a speech in Lushan, I explained the danger of concentrating wealth in Shanghai and strongly advocated adopting a decentralized policy. We should reduce the concentration of wealth in large cities and spread it across the country, storing wealth among the people. Then, even if Japan is strong, it cannot completely destroy our national wealth. This is one way to survive economically. If wealth is concentrated in Shanghai and communication is cut off by the enemy, the paper currency will become worthless and lose its circulation ability. Customs duties will have no revenue, and public bonds are mostly based on customs revenue as a fund, so principal and interest cannot be paid. How can new debts be issued? The government's financial resources will be extremely exhausted. How can we avoid destruction? Therefore, I advocated two years ago that the nation's reserves should be concentrated in one place and shifted with the military center. The military uses the reserves as a backing to maintain its value and avoid disputes. The reserves are protected by the military, which is enough to stabilize people's hearts and eliminate hidden dangers. There is no better way than this. This is in regards to the situation two years ago when the reserves had not yet been concentrated. Today, the reserves have adopted a centralized policy, the situation has changed, and this point seems to be no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The Undesirability of Excessive Paper Currency Issuance</p>
<p>So, how should we deal with the urgent financial needs in times of emergency today? Some say that the tax system is difficult to improve in a short time, and it is difficult to issue public bonds at that time. However, the disaster of war is imminent. To seek a way out, is paper currency policy the only option? The purpose of finance is to obtain goods with money. Issuing more paper currency at that time is enough to obtain more goods. Isn't this a way to achieve the goal? This is a last resort. We must know that issuing paper currency is a matter of finance, and the government's use of money is a matter of public finance. Public finance expenditure is a one-way flow, while financial circulation is endless. For example, if a cloth merchant borrows 100,000 yuan from a bank to buy cotton to spin, weave, and make cloth, the 100,000 yuan will be scattered throughout society. When the cloth is woven, sold, and the banknotes are recovered, the bank is repaid. Thus, the cloth is consumed by society, and the banknotes are also recovered. Therefore, banknotes issued for commerce have the ability to self-generate and self-destruct. This is called finance. Public finance is different. Regular expenses are often unproductive. Wartime expenses are all consumed in the crossfire. If banknotes are issued to purchase military supplies, the supplies will soon disappear, but the banknotes will continue to circulate freely. They can be issued but not recovered, resulting in a drop in currency value and soaring prices, which will have a profound impact. Therefore, public finance and finance should be clearly separated and independent, not mixed up. However, people today consider it a helpless solution, a matter of emergency, and should not be judged by normal theories. We must know that if there is no other way to deal with the emergency than to issue paper currency, I have no objection. If there is another way to provide relief, I would strongly oppose it. Moreover, those who advocate issuing paper currency to deal with emergencies only consider the convenience of mobilization and have never considered the difficulties of post-war recovery. If we consider the impact of paper currency policy on the difficulties of post-war recovery, I know that the advocates would also hesitate. Please take the results of the European War as an example, which can be understood clearly. Countries at war, such as England and the United States, tried their best to find ways to finance war expenses from taxation. Although the proportion of public bonds issued was much larger than that of taxes, they always relied on tax revenue to repay the principal and interest of war debts. The proportion of paper currency was very small, so post-war recovery was relatively easy. France, on the other hand, suffered significant tax revenue losses because important areas were occupied by Germany. Tax revenue was still tight to meet regular expenses, so post-war recovery was more difficult than in England and the United States. Germany, Austria, and Russia used the issuance of paper currency as a supplement. Germany initially thought that it had a firm grasp of victory and that war expenses could be recovered from reparations, so it did not need to increase taxes and burden the people. It adopted a policy of public bonds and paper currency. However, the result was unexpected. It was completely defeated. After the war, the paper currency became almost worthless, and the national vitality was most severely damaged. Although post-war recovery was never slow, it relied entirely on American funds. Austria has not yet recovered to this day. From 1923 to 1929, the United States lent a lot of capital to Germany, but it has not been able to recover it, so it does not dare to lend again. Few non-convertible paper currencies during wartime can avoid price declines, but the degree of decline must be limited. If the value of paper currency is not completely lost, it will still have circulation power, which means that the nation's funds are still substantially preserved, and recovery is easy. After the war, Germany used one trillion paper marks to exchange for only one gold mark, which was almost inferior to rough paper. The national circulating funds were almost completely lost, so the national economy was extremely difficult. Without foreign debt assistance, I don't know when the German economy will recover. If China also relies on paper currency policy to plan for war expenses in the future, the damage to vitality and the difficulty of recovery will be much greater than in Germany. This is because the Chinese people are poorer than the Germans. After scraping them clean, it is even more difficult to accumulate savings. The United States has learned from the previous mistakes of German debt and may not be willing to lend to China. Even if it has the sincerity to lend, it will be obstructed by Japan. Moreover, the revival of Germany after the war was greatly sympathized with by the British and Americans, because they wanted it to restore its purchasing power and restore the market for British and American goods. Japan is different. It must make the Chinese economy never develop. In the future, those who obstruct the revival of our economy will use all means to achieve their goals. This is another difficult problem for China. Therefore, when we implement economic mobilization today, we must consider the difficulties of post-war recovery and proceed with caution.</p>
<p>The reason why England can focus on taxation to raise war expenses is because of the excellence of its tax system. England uses income tax as its center, and the tax rate increases cumulatively with the increase of income. Those with wealth have the strongest ability to bear taxes, so their tax rate is also the highest. This not only conforms to the principle of fairness, but if there is an urgent need, the tax rate can be increased to 60 or 70 percent of income without depleting the people's capital. The government's revenue can be greatly increased, so it is extremely flexible. This is the benefit of focusing on taxation to raise war expenses. Paper currency, on the other hand, is distributed throughout the country, and both the rich and the poor have the opportunity to use it. Therefore, if the government uses paper currency to absorb private wealth, the losses of the poor are much greater than those of the rich. It is too unfair. Moreover, the universality and triviality of capital exploitation increase the difficulty of post-war economic recovery many times over. Therefore, a financial policy that focuses on income tax concentrates the burden on the rich and does not harm capital. A financial policy that focuses on paper currency to raise war expenses is the opposite in every way. China's tax system, which centers on indirect taxes, is already unsuitable as a good financial system in wartime, and the harm of paper currency policy is so great. This is the particularly difficult situation in China.</p>

<h3>Participating in European War Commemoration; Rome Inspects Youth Corps; Italian Prime Minister Mussolini Delivers Encouraging Speech; Today Receiving Military Training, in the Future Pillars of the Nation</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Youth Corps of young men and women held a parade today, and, in front of the prime minister's residence, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech. First, he asked, "Armed comrades, are we now bravely advancing?" The crowd responded in the affirmative. The Italian state continued, "Today is May 24th. I officially announce that we will achieve as much in the future as we have in the past. We are preparing a youth army for the future to defend our empire. They are inspired by the Fascist spirit and will surely be victorious in all endeavors." During the military parade, the entire city was adorned with flags. The Italian Prime Minister wore the uniform of the Blackshirt commander, rode a tall horse, and, together with Governor General Lilia, General Balbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, Taibono, and cabinet members, reviewed the troops at the parade ground. The Italian authorities specifically transferred a thousand Arab boy scouts from Lilia to participate in the military parade. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today marks the 19th anniversary of Italy's participation in the European War and the promotion day for members of all levels of the Fascist Party's youth corps (an annual event, this being the tenth time). Children who are eight years old can join the Fascist Party's youth corps on this day. Members of the youth corps who are fourteen years old can be promoted to members of the vanguard. Members of the vanguard who are eighteen years old can be promoted to formal youth party members. This ceremony was recently held at the Temple of Venus, and party leaders presented the "Military Training Certificate" to members of the youth corps and vanguard members (it is noted that all Italian children who are eight years old in the future must be issued this certificate). After the ceremony, Prime Minister Mussolini, Governor General of Italian Libya in North Africa General Balbo, and former High Commissioner of Italian East Africa General De Bono reviewed members of the various youth groups on the Imperial Avenue. The Prime Minister also gave a speech, saying, "Comrades, listen! Today marks the first step in the Fascist Party's revolutionary work. The members are young, strong, and vibrant. It is not only a grand event but also a warning, because what we are doing is cultivating youth, the future army, to defend the empire. These young people, all filled with the Fascist spirit, will surely be an invincible force in the future. The will of the Italian people lies in this." Veterans went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the Shrine of Fascist Martyrs in Venice Square to pay their respects and then gathered in front of Venice Palace to congratulate the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister stepped onto the balcony and gave a public speech, briefly stating, "I now want to ask all comrades and veterans a question: Have we been bravely advancing toward our established goals thus far?" The crowd shouted, "Yes!" The Prime Minister concluded his speech by saying, "Then, from this day on, we must continue to do so and never slacken!" (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Haifa: Minutes before the King of Arabia boarded the British cruiser "Cape Town" leaving Haifa today, a bomb was thrown into an open-air cinema facing the harbor, injuring two people. This incident is part of the feud between Arabs and Jews and is unrelated to the King's trip. After the King arrives at Gibraltar on the British cruiser, he will travel to England on the British Shipping Company's "Kauf" ship. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Goods from Sanctioning Nations; Italy Bans Imports into Abyssinia</h3>
<p>French Authorities' Response; Only Option is to Sever Railway Traffic</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, news came from Rome stating that Italian authorities in Abyssinia have banned the import of goods from sanctioning nations. Although this has not been officially announced here, political figures believe that if the Italian government were to take this action, authorities in French Djibouti would sever the railway traffic from the port to Addis Ababa. Since the Italian government announced its annexation of Abyssinia, this route has continued to operate without interruption. If Italy bans the import of goods from sanctioning nations, then French goods cannot be transported to Abyssinia via this route, and the railway can only be used for the Italian army's transportation, which will undoubtedly lead to significant business losses. Therefore, the French authorities have no choice but to sever traffic in response to Italy. However, this ban has not been officially announced and remains a rumor, so we are hesitant to believe it.

<h3>National Socialist Party Offices Searched in Upper Austria</h3>
<p>Response to Attack on Prince Starhemberg's Residence; 28 Party Members Arrested on Suspicion</p>
<p>Vienna Premier Schuschnigg today ordered the arrest of national leaders of the National Socialist Party throughout the country as a response to the attack by National Socialist Party members on Prince Starhemberg's residence in Upper Austria. As a result of the fierce fighting between police and National Socialist Party members, two people have died: a farmer and a driver, both 32 years old. Currently, 28 prominent party members have been arrested. The police are making every effort to search. At the same time, Prince Starhemberg has left his country residence and flown to the capital. According to official reports, there were a total of 50 people attacking the Prince's residence. The government has refused to announce how it was able to obtain prior information. It is claimed that the purpose of the attack was to seize the weapons of the Home Guard hidden in the residence. However, the Home Guard authorities today stated that no weapons are stored there. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Police in Upper Austria today searched the offices of the National Socialist Party and detained eight people. It is said to be related to last night's attack on Starhemberg's residence in the Wachsen locality. It is rumored that the residence contains a large number of rifles, machine guns, bullets, and gun sights and is known as the Home Guard armoury. According to unofficial sources, 15 National Socialist Party members broke into the residence at night, but were discovered by hidden gendarmes. They were ordered to surrender, but the 15 men, knowing that they were prepared, quickly tried to escape. The gendarmes immediately opened fire. The attackers also returned fire. It is reported that one leader and four members of the National Socialist Party have crossed the nearby border and entered Czechoslovakia. Two party members were injured at the time, one of whom died shortly after, and the other later died from his injuries. Starhemberg was not in the residence at the time of the attack. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Following the attack on the mansion of Prince Starhemberg, former Deputy Chancellor of Upper Austria, in Wachsenburg (only an hour's journey from the border with the German province of Bavaria), twenty members of the National Socialist Party here have been arrested by gendarmes on suspicion of conspiracy. One of the rioters who participated in the attack was shot and wounded by the police and has since died from his injuries. It is generally believed that the leader of the rioters has already fled across the border to Germany. Count Levider-Laber, the chief of the Upper Austrian police department, has rushed to Wachsenburg to investigate whether the local National Socialist Party members have any intention of carrying out further terrorist activities.

<h3>French Authorities Ban Performance of New Play "Hitler"</h3>
<p>Fearing Offense to German Sentiments</p>
<p>(Paris) A newly written play, titled "Hitler," in a certain theater in the Belleville district of Paris, depicting the life of the German leader Adolf Hitler, from the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 until recently. Among the scenes portrayed, the two most notable were: the result of the 1933 German Reichstag elections, in which the National Socialist Party won a great victory, after which President Hindenburg summoned Hitler and entrusted him with the task of forming a cabinet; and the night of the Long Knives in June 30, 1934, when Hitler burst into the bedroom of former Sturmabteilung leader Ernst Röhm, found him sleeping with a young boy, and, in a fit of rage, personally shot Röhm dead on the spot. Fearing that it would cause disputes, Premier Sarraut, who is also Minister of the Interior, has recently banned the performance. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Leader of Southern Ireland, Éamon de Valera, Regains Sight</h3>
<p>After weeks of treatment and eye surgery, the leader of the Irish Free State, Éamon de Valera, left here yesterday to return home. His eyesight has now been temporarily restored, but he is still wearing very thick glasses. Before leaving here, de Valera initially had to stay in the darkest place, and soon moved to a dim room. After several weeks in this manner, and with the help of medicine, his eyesight was restored. However, it is not yet known whether de Valera will be able to continue his political life.

<h3>Italy and Albania Reach Financial and Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Italy Agrees to Grant Loans to Assist Albanian Construction on the Condition of Promoting Sales of Italian Goods</p>
<p>(Rome) The financial and economic agreement previously signed by the government and the State of Albania on March 19 of this year has recently been announced in the official gazette. Regarding the economic portion, it stipulates that the State of Albania should protect and encourage the import of Italian goods. Regarding the financial portion, it stipulates that the agreement previously entered into by both parties in 1931 should be cancelled. Subsequently, Italy will only lend the Albanian government 10 million gold francs annually for various construction expenses. As for Albania's budget deficit, Italy will only compensate for 9 million gold francs. In addition, a loan of 10 million gold francs should be provided, to be disbursed over five years, for other important needs. Italy will also provide the funds needed to improve the port of Durazzo. The Albanian government should agree to establish a management agency in the port, whose personnel should be approved by Italy. Italy should also allocate another 3 million gold francs for Albania to implement a tobacco monopoly. The key personnel of this agency should be Italian. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Serious Riots Continue in Jerusalem</h3>
<p>Arabs Defy Night Curfew, Gathering Crowds to Demonstrate and Clash with Police</p>
<p>Jerusalem A serious riot occurred in Nablus, north of Jerusalem, today. As the night curfew was about to begin, someone placed obstacles in a certain road. Police, assisted by British soldiers, attempted to remove them, but were pelted with stones by the crowd. The police issued repeated warnings, but the crowd ignored them and continued to throw stones. Only when the police fired several volleys did the crowd disperse. The number of dead and wounded is still unknown. Minor riots occurred in Jerusalem and Jaffa today. In Jaffa, crowds gathered and attempted to enter a mosque after the night curfew took effect. The police deployed sentries around the mosque, prohibiting people from entering. In Jerusalem, five prominent Arab youth leaders were arrested for causing trouble. Three thousand Muslims violated the night curfew and gathered at the Omar Mosque. The police placed heavy guards at each entrance and exit until the night curfew had passed before allowing them to leave. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Amends Constitution</h3>
<p>Parliament Adopts a Bicameral System</p>
<p>Moscow Since the Soviet Constitutional Amendment Committee began its work in July of last year, it has reportedly used the Swiss Federal Constitution as a model. Political figures recently revealed that the future parliament will adopt a bicameral system: one chamber will be the House of Representatives, elected by universal suffrage, and the other will be the Senate, elected by the federal republics based on nationality. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. As for candidates for parliament, they will be nominated by various groups, such as factories, cooperative societies, and corporations, and then selected by the electorate. Consequently, the slogan promoted by the Marxists, "Workers of all countries, unite!" which is still seen on the Soviet emblem, will certainly be abolished in the future. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Island in the Arctic Ocean, Heinous Crimes Unforgivable</h3>
<p>Committing Political Banditry; Russian Supreme Court Sentences to Death</p>

<h3>Chemistry Lectures, Part 3: A History of the Development of Chemistry in China (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Chen Kezhong, Full-Time Translator, National Bureau of Compilation and Translation</p>
<p>The main purpose of the Jiangnan Arsenal was to manufacture guns, cannons, and gunpowder, and its scale was quite large compared to other countries at the time. Although we had such a large manufacturing plant at this time, and translated so many chemistry books, the literati and officials of the time advocated the idea of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application." The "application" here referred to industries such as commerce and industry, which they considered minor and were despised by the general public. Therefore, genuine chemistry talent and a genuine atmosphere of research could not be created. As a result, not only was there no progress, but there was also a gradual decline. Now, it would be difficult to find a military factory as large as the Jiangnan Arsenal in China. After the founding of the Republic of China, schools in the north and south, such as Peking University, Beiyang University, and Nanjing Higher Normal School, advocated science education and made great efforts. However, both equipment and talent were severely lacking, and it was already felt to be insufficient for teaching, let alone research. However, at this time, everyone gradually realized that chemistry was a science that should be promoted, and this realization can be regarded as the foundation for future development. Since the establishment of the National Government, an atmosphere of chemical research has truly been established, and the achievements shown have increased day by day. If we compare the current state of development of chemistry with that of forty or fifty years ago, it is truly incomparable. Although some people felt that science should be promoted in the past, they did not know how to cultivate research talent and a research environment, and were just shouting slogans. This is like a tree without roots or a well without a spring, which will soon dry up. Now, Chinese chemistry can be said to have a foundation. First, the number of people doing research is gradually increasing. Second, the number of chemical research institutions has reached a considerable number, and equipment is slowly getting on track. Third, a spirit of hard work and dedication to research has been successfully cultivated in various chemical research institutions in the country. Speaking of the current chemical research institutions in China, we can divide them into three types and introduce them separately: The first type is public chemical research institutions, the more important of which are the Institute of Chemistry of the Academia Sinica, the Institute of Chemistry and the Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the Peiping Research Academy, the Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry. In addition, there are industrial experiment institutes in various provinces and cities, such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Shanghai, as well as the Guangzhou Science Research Association and the Guangxi Chemical Experiment Institute. The second type is private research institutions, such as the Huanghai Chemical Industry Research Society, the Shanghai Zhonghua Chemical Research Institute, and the Institute of Physics and Chemistry of the Western China Academy of Sciences. In addition, there are the Lester Institute, run by the British in Shanghai, and the Institute of Natural Sciences, run by the Japanese with Sino-Japanese Boxer Indemnity funds. Both of these research institutes have several Chinese chemical researchers. The third type is the chemistry departments of public and private universities and the affiliated chemical or chemical engineering research institutes, such as Tsinghua, Peking, Central, Yanjing, Nankai, and Jinling Universities. In addition, the chemical equipment and research achievements of universities such as National Central University, Zhejiang, Wuhan, Soochow, Lingnan, and Shandong are also quite impressive.</p>
<p>From the above three aspects, we can know that China has established a very strong foundation in modern chemistry in recent years. If we can continue to uphold this pragmatic and hardworking spirit in the future, it will not be difficult to catch up with the modern chemistry of Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Before the Republic of China, we in China talked little about chemical research. After the Republic of China, we had some chemical talents doing some research abroad, but the results of the research were all sent to foreign chemistry journals for publication. So even if there were contributions, Chinese chemistry still had no status in the world. When the Ministry of Education convened a chemistry discussion meeting in Nanjing in 1932, everyone felt this need, so everyone initiated the establishment of the "Chinese Chemical Society." The most important work of this group is to publish research publications, publishing all domestic chemical research articles entirely in Western languages (this is what the Japanese did). On the one hand, it allows countries around the world to know about the state of chemistry research in our country, and on the other hand, it can promote the atmosphere of chemical research in China. Now it has a history of four years, and the number of research papers is already quite impressive. Therefore, Chinese chemistry has also gained a considerable position in the world. In recent years, apart from geology and biology, chemistry is probably the most impressive in terms of the performance of scientific research achievements in China.</p>
<p>In terms of chemistry education, there has also been great progress recently. As mentioned above, in universities, the number of talents has gradually increased, equipment has gradually improved, and research has slowly become more intense. The chemical equipment of universities like Tsinghua University is comparable to that of first-class universities abroad, and even the research results are not bad. Most of these researchers are young, and if given time, their achievements will naturally be even more impressive. As for the middle school section, the government has recently revised the curriculum standards and equipment standards, which will of course improve soon.</p>
<p>In terms of the chemical industry, it is now very different from the past. In the late Qing Dynasty, China already felt that the manufacture of military equipment had to rely on other industries. However, if industry is to develop, it must start with the development of the chemical industry. The chemical industry at that time was really not worth mentioning, but now it has a considerable foundation. For example, in terms of alkali production, there are the Yongli Alkali Plant in Tanggu and the Guangdong Provincial Soda Factory. In terms of acid production, there are the Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Plant in Shanghai, the Lizhong Acid Plant in Tianjin, and the sulfuric acid plants run by the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments. In terms of fertilizers, there is the Yongli Ammonium Sulfate Plant in Pukou, and in terms of nitric acid, there is the Tianli Nitrous Oxide Plant in Shanghai. In addition, the Shanghai Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant and the China Alcohol Plant are also basic chemical industries. Recently, Guangdong and Guangxi have been working hard on construction, and many chemical plants have been established.</p>
<p>To develop chemistry education, our goal must pay attention to three factors: first, talent; second, equipment; and third, the research environment. The development of the chemical industry also depends on these factors. Therefore, chemistry education and the chemical industry are interconnected and mutually beneficial. It is naturally inappropriate for us to develop chemistry education without considering the chemical industry. However, if we want to develop the chemical industry without considering the factors necessary for chemistry education, we will not be able to develop it. If we assume that we moved China's nascent chemical industry to the end of the Qing Dynasty, then this industry would certainly not last long, because at that time they did not consider the cultivation of talent and the research environment, but simply mechanically copied the success of others. In this way, in the entire chemical process, there is simply no foundation, so it is naturally impossible to keep pace with the times and will eventually be eliminated. Conversely, if the late Qing Dynasty had the talent, equipment, and research atmosphere that we have now, then these basic chemical industries would have developed long ago. This is true not only in China, but also in other countries around the world. For example, Germany is the country with the best chemical research results, and its chemical industry is also particularly developed, which is not accidental. Now some people are always wondering: "Should we promote the chemical industry or promote chemical research?" If they understand the facts described above, they will not raise this question again in the future. (The End)</p>

<h3>Travelogue of Qinghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>(3) Qunketan Mongol Banner</p>
<p>The tent houses in this area also belong to the commoners of Chahan Nuomen Khan. While chatting, the tea had already boiled. She added two spoons of milk. At the same time, she took out four greasy porcelain bowls from behind. The old woman knew we disliked the dirtiness. She carefully wiped the bowls inside and out with dry cow dung, removing the grease. The dung crumbs remained in the bowls. She then took a black rag and wiped them very clean. Finally, she poured four bowls of milk tea and had her daughter bring them over. She also took out a box of tsampa and placed it by the stove for us to eat. We were all hungry and drank a bowl of tea without minding the dirtiness, kneaded a piece of tsampa, hurriedly expressed our thanks, left the tent, mounted our horses, and set off.</p>
<p>In the valley, we passed a place for the sky burial of Tibetans. Many meat-eating eagles (vultures) stood on the slope. I thought a sky burial was taking place. As we galloped past, the eagles were startled and flew away.</p>
<p>Today, we traveled eighty li round trip, very quickly. The sun had not yet set when we returned to our lodging. The steward was surprised because he had prepared for my return tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sunken Ancient City</p>
<p>The place name of Chahan Nuomen Khan is called "Triangle City" because there is an ancient city behind the village here called "Triangle City". I had already heard people talking about the ancient city's events on the way, so I had visited it twice here. The city is located one hundred steps behind the village, spread out below the Harqin Mountains. The remains of earthen walls, one zhang high, can still be seen around the perimeter. At several gaps, traces of brick walls can still be found. The bricks are about two chi in length. The entire city is rectangular. The eastern and western city walls are about 500 meters long, the northern city wall is about 400 meters long, and the southern city wall is 300 meters long. There are gaps for two gates in the north and south. A tributary of the Huangshui River meanders south, circling the northeast corner of the city. The altitude here is 3,080 meters, about 170 li northwest of Xining.</p>
<p>The inside of the city is very desolate. There are no remains of broken walls or ruined houses on the ground. The ground is mostly covered with lush weeds. There are many wild rabbits. They rise and run away when they hear footsteps. There is currently a herder's tent house in the northeast corner of the city. There are also two similar tent houses outside the northwest corner, so their cattle and sheep occupy the entire city as a pasture. In front of a tent house in the northwest corner, we discovered a small mound two chi high, with many broken bricks and rubble on it. However, we could not find a complete brick or a piece of tile with a pattern. In the southeast of the city, there is a square stone base, four chi high and three chi wide, commonly known as a stone trough. The stone crevices are filled with rubble, like a Tibetan man's heap of mahaliu. Two li south of the city, on the left side of the road, there is a stone tiger buried deep in the soil. It is five chi long from head to tail and about three chi high. Most of the stone base is deeply sunken underground. The lines of the stone tiger's carving are simple and unadorned, and the style is very similar to the stone tiger in the tomb of Huo Qubing in Xianyang. Under its stone base, we used a small knife to dig away a row of soil and saw three small seal characters "Xi Chao Gong". According to the Tibetan, there are many more characters below. It is expected that the age of its carving can be found on this base. However, our small knife could not dig through the hard mud and stone, and it was also the day we were about to set off, so the effort was unfortunately interrupted. It is said that this stone tiger was originally inside the city with the stone trough, so its relationship with the ancient city is very important. Perhaps the age of the ancient city can be found on it.</p>
<p>Legend of the Miraculous</p>
<p>As for how that stone tiger was moved outside the city, there is also a story that is almost mythological. In the 21st year, the Qinghai Provincial Government held a public entertainment exhibition in Xining to collect local products. A civil servant from the Huangyuan Customs had been to Triangle City and seen the stone tiger. He wanted to transport the stone tiger to Xining to display it in the public entertainment exhibition. At that time, he made a phone call to the provincial authorities, and the exhibition hall welcomed it. However, transportation was very inconvenient for this section of road entering the mountain. Therefore, workers were specially dispatched to build it so that large carts could pass, that is, mule carts for transporting goods. After the road was repaired, a large cart was sent in to transport it. At that time, the local Tibetans were unwilling because they believed that the stone tiger protected the local crops. However, no one dared to resist the government. A lama made a "prediction of not moving," which everyone did not understand. On the day of departure, the weather was very clear and the stone tiger was loaded onto a large cart in the city and pulled down. Everything was fine along the way. After traveling "li," dark clouds suddenly covered the sky, and there was thunder and lightning, followed by a strong wind and heavy rain. The stone tiger fell off at the current location. No matter how many people tried to lift it, or how many horses tried to pull it, it would not move, as if it had taken root. This fulfilled the lama's "not moving" prediction. A day later, it suddenly sank several chi. Since then, there has been no way to move it even half a step, so the plan to pull it to Xining was terminated.</p>
<p>Exploration of the Ancient City</p>
<p>"Triangle City" is a general name. What is its actual name, and what is its historical value? It is worth exploring. Now that we see its remains and the carving of the stone tiger, we know that it is definitely not a new city of modern times. At the same time, we have heard people say that the bricks found in the city before had the characters "Xi Mang Guo" on them. Indeed, we have not seen the bricks, so we cannot judge it to be a Han city. However, research from various aspects is also somewhat reliable. Qinghai is the ancient land of the Western Rong, Western Qiang, and Tubo. It has always been called the borderland, so this independent city must have an important relationship with border defense. Perhaps it went through a war during a certain border disturbance and was destroyed, desolate, and sunken.</p>
<p>The Xining Prefecture Gazetteer only has one mention of the name Triangle City, saying that it is "northwest of the Datong Guard, 140 li west of Yong'an City. Built during the Yuan Dynasty, the remains of the walls still exist today. The Black Water River passes through its south, now called the Ejinai River." Yong'an City is now Dieyuan County, which is directly north of this place, several stations away. The direction and distance would never be so far off. Generally, there is another city west of Yong'an, so this Triangle City is definitely not the Triangle City recorded in the Prefecture Gazetteer. At the same time, we dare to say that the name Triangle City is definitely not the ancient city name.</p>
<p>Most of the cities in Qinghai echo each other remotely in the east, south, and north of Xining, forming a vertical defensive line. Therefore, there are few cities west of Xining. The Xining Prefecture Gazetteer tells us that there are three ancient cities west of Xining, in the Huangshui River basin and on the shore of Qinghai Lake, with similar situations:</p>
<p>1.  "Former City of Linyi" is located west of the county. It was established during the Han Dynasty and belonged to the Jincheng Commandery. During the Jin Dynasty, it belonged to the Xiping Commandery. The Water Classic Commentary states that the Huangshui River flows east through the north of the Former City of Linyi. The county was abolished during the Later Wei Dynasty. In the fourth year of the Daye era of the Sui Dynasty, Tuyuhun was defeated by the Tiele and fled into the Xiping border for help. Emperor Yang of Sui ordered Yu Wenshu to go out of Xiping to welcome them. When Yu Wenshu arrived at Linyi, Tuyuhun fled from here.</p>
<p>2.  "Former City of the New County of Linyi" is located west of the county seat. Kan Yin said that the New County of Linyi is 180 li west of the commandery. The Huangshui River flows through its south. The city has two gates, east and west. There is a sub-city in the northwest corner.</p>
<p>3.  "Former City of the Xihai Commandery" is located west of the county. The Thirteen Provinces Chronicle states that the city is west of the New County of Linyi. Wang Mang sent an envoy to satirize "Bei He Qiang" and offered the Fresh Water Sea Yungu Salt Pond, establishing the Xihai Commandery. It is now located in the Qinghai territory.</p>
<p>Except for the founding of the New County of Linyi, whose age cannot be verified, the other two former cities were established during the Han Dynasty. Because the Western Qiang were the most troublesome during the Han Dynasty, and the imperial court's military achievements in Qinghai were also the greatest.</p>
<p>The direction, distance, and the age of construction of the above three cities all have matching points. According to my personal conjecture, the ancient name of Triangle City is also among these three cities. However, I cannot make a blind judgment because I do not have in-depth research on the evolution of Qinghai's geography. At the same time, I have not excavated the former city. However, I hope that scholars who study Qinghai history or archaeology will pay attention to it so that this long-sleeping ancient city can be discovered one day.</p>
<p>Ice Blocks Flying in the Air</p>
<p>On the day we were exploring the stone tiger, we left the ancient city to return to Baiyang Gorge. We went straight south along the Huangshui River, passing through the newly opened Yangjia Beach, where there were several Han Chinese earthen houses. There, we encountered three merchants from Qaidam. They had been traveling on camels for twenty-four days.</p>
<p>The weather in the afternoon became slightly windy again. After turning a mountain bay, the wind became stronger. The road led straight along the riverbed to the bottom of a cliff. The fierce wind hit the cliff directly and swirled in front of our horses. If people encountered it, they would also suffer. A large whirlwind suddenly lifted thin ice blocks in the Huangshui River ten zhang high and whirled them in the air. It was a spectacle. However, we were also sensible and hurriedly galloped our horses away to avoid being hit on the head if they fell down. It is said that a strong wind once swept a flock of sheep off the mountain, leaving no trace.</p>
<p>The distance from Triangle City to Baiyang Gorge is only forty or so li, which we reached in three hours. We still stayed at Cao Lao-ye's house. The Mongols are the most honest people. He warmly entertained us and insisted that we rest there for another day and asked us to take pictures of his family. Because we could not refuse, we accepted his sincerity.</p>
<p>That night, the village temple had a Mi Hu Zi (a kind of theatrical performance). He lit a lantern and invited us to visit. The performers were a group of Han Chinese from the village. They also had gongs and drums and were singing Qinqiang opera. The night was very cold, and there were not many spectators. When they saw us arrive, they specially performed "Jia Guan" (a blessing performance). They also received a considerable reward.</p>
<p>The next morning, many people in the village wanted to take pictures. After we took the pictures, we were invited by a lama to visit the Fuhai Temple in a mountain gorge five li east. This place is a temple belonging to the Chahan Nuomen Khan.</p>
<p>Scenery of Baiyang Gorge</p>
<p>Baiyang Gorge is a very strategic location, bordering the Huangshui River. Within five li above the Zhacang Temple, there are willows and poplars providing shade, and fields connect to each other. There are two majestic mountain gorges at both ends, like large front and back doors.</p>
<p>This is the commoner's of the Erlike Beile. There are fifty to sixty households in the entire village, of which three-tenths are Han Chinese. The villagers all plant a few dou of crops and also engage in livestock husbandry as a sideline, raising dozens of sheep and a dozen cattle. The crops are harvested once a year, producing highland barley. The farmland is all on the slopes, and the sloping gravel fields are not very fertile.</p>
<p>Here, one cannot find a single black tent house or Zigu-colored building. They are all two-story earthen houses. However, a few poor people have hollowed out the earthen layer and live in cave dwellings.</p>
<p>Men and women have equal labor here. Men mainly do the farming, with women helping. Women mainly do the housework, with men helping.</p>
<p>The Mongols here can all speak Chinese, and some young people can no longer speak Mongolian. The men's attire is completely the same as the Han Chinese, with long robes and short jackets. Only a few elderly people retain their Mongolian character by keeping a small braid and wearing a felt hat. The women's attire is completely different from the round-collared, large-sleeved style of Qunketan. It is very similar to the narrow, long-hemmed banner gowns of Inner Mongolia. The edges are also decorated with a narrow strip of colored lace. Cloth is used for clothing, and cotton is worn in winter instead of sheepskin. This is also a characteristic of theirs. The earrings are very long, hanging down to the shoulders. The hats are the same as the leather-eared hats of Qunketan. The hair is divided into two strands, hanging down the back. A long, narrow braid cover is hung with many rectangular silver plates, swaying behind the back. The attire here is completely consistent with the attire of most nomadic Mongols in Qinghai, so people generally call them fake Mongols.</p>
<p>They also believe in Lamaism, but there are not many lamas. Few patients take medicine. Most of them ask lamas to chant scriptures. For surgical symptoms, they like to bathe in hot springs.</p>
<p>Strange Marriage Customs</p>
<p>The Mongols are an ethical and polite people. This is the same everywhere. They greet each other, ask about the health of their livestock, and when courteous relatives and friends meet, they use a hada (a strip of gauze) as a greeting gift. When girls aged seventeen or eighteen have not yet married, the family invites a lama to recite scriptures on New Year's Eve. At the same time, they sprinkle a burst of dharma water on her face, and her hair can be divided into two strands and she can wear a braid cover. This is called wearing a tiantou. After that, she can associate with men and have children at will.</p>
<p>Marriage is still based on liberalism. The age of marriage for men is above fifteen, and the age of marriage for women is fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, or twenty-one, with odd numbers being considered auspicious. Betrothal gifts are also given before marriage, with cattle and sheep as property. Wedding dates are all in autumn because the climate is suitable, the crops have been harvested, and the cattle and sheep are also fat. When the wedding procession arrives, many women from the groom's family sing and dance in the suburbs to welcome the bride. A group of men take wine, beef, and mutton and wait at the road intersection to worship the heavens. Then they leap onto their horses and circle around the women from the bride's family, trying to grab their pointed hats. The men from the bride's family also ride their horses and grab the hats of the women from the groom's family. In the end, the side with more hats wins. One more hat means one more catty of white wine, and the losing women must sing a song. The bride returns to her parents' home three days later and comes back to her husband's home seven days later.</p>
<p>For funeral rites, farmers who grow crops practice burial using coffins. Nomadic people practice sky burial with vultures.</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Hankou Railway: Full Line Scheduled Trial Runs, Passenger Tickets Sold During Trial Period, Official Opening Set for Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The Guangdong section of the railway has been completed. The most challenging engineering feats on the entire line were the three major iron bridges at Lu River, Zhu River, and Zhao River in the northern section between Zhuzhou and Hengyang, and the seven tunnels south of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section. Before the Zhu River bridge was completed, a temporary bridge was used. The Lu River has a width of over 300 meters, with a proposed two-line crossing. The railway bureau, to carefully select the bridge site, used mechanical drilling to investigate the geology, ultimately adopting the Sai Kou line. The Zhao River bridge is over 200 meters wide, with eight spans. These two bridges are more than 100 li apart, with a long water source and rapid flow, making the pier construction extensive and time-consuming, with construction continuing day and night in March. The Fengyang Bridge is located near Pingshi, at the border of Hunan and Guangdong, with eight spans of 18 meters each, totaling 30 meters in length. Although the distance from Chenzhou in Hunan to Shaoguan in Guangdong is short, the engineering is extremely challenging, as it involves seven interconnected tunnels in the Jiufeng Mountain and Meishan areas, adjacent to the Nanling Mountains, with towering peaks and cliffs. Merchants and travelers considered it a daunting route, so the road construction mainly involved drilling through solid rock, demonstrating its difficulty.</p>
<p>The station buildings along the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the railway, in Hengzhou, Zhuzhou, Lechang, Dongmingdu, and other locations, have now been completed. The remaining stations, to promote economic efficiency, are constructed as temporary stations using corrugated iron. It is estimated that there are more than ninety stations of varying sizes along the entire line from Wuchang in Hubei directly to Guangzhou, namely Wuchang, Xujiapeng, Tongxiangmen, Niuyutao, Shejiawan, Zhifang, Tuditang, Hejiaqiao, Guanbuqiao, Xianning, Tingsiqiao, Zhonghuopu, Yunxi, Chenglingji, Yuezhou, Matang, Yingjiawan, Huangshajie, Taolin Temple, Miluo, Baishui, Gaojiafang, Shahe, Qiaotouyi, Xiani, Changsha North, Changsha East, Datopu, Yijiawan, Zhuzhou, Lukou, Sanmen, Zhaoling, Jinkou, Zhuting, Shiwan, Hengshan, Xialiu City, Da'erbu, Hengzhou, Dongyangdu, Guanyinqiao, Wayuan, Zhezhao, Zhao Yang, Xiaoshuipu, Gongpingxu, Gaotingsi, Loufengdu, Xujia Temple, Chenzhou, Aoshan, Dengjiatang, Taipingli, Baishidu, Pingshi, Luojiadu, Qimen, Lechang, Yangxi, Liputou, Hebianfu, Shaoguan, Maba, Wushi, Dakengkou, Shakou, Hetou, Yingde, Boluokeng, Lianjiangkou, Lidong, Jiuhengshi, Pajiangkou, Yuantan, Yingzui, Yinzhan'ao, Juntian, Letong, Xinjie, Guotang, Jiangcun, Dalang, Xiaoping, Xicun, Huangsha, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The railway was completed on the 28th of last month. The carriages purchased in England are expected to arrive before the Double Tenth Festival. Currently, a train has been borrowed from the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau. Originally scheduled for May 15th, the trial run from Guangzhou directly to Wuhan has been delayed until the beginning of June due to the recent completion of the roadbed between Chenzhou and Pingshi, which is not yet fully firm. The official opening is set for the Double Tenth Festival. During the trial period, passenger tickets will be sold simultaneously, with stops at all stations, large and small. The round trip will take three days, requiring 43 hours. Once the opening ceremony is held, it is planned to reduce the time to 36 hours. The total length of the line is 1096 kilometers. The fare is set at 1.25 cents per kilometer, with 13.7 yuan for third class, 27.4 yuan for second class, and 41.2 yuan for first class. (May 19th)</p>

<h3>Competition Between British and Japanese Shipping in South China: A Total of Ten Ships Between Shanghai and Xiamen, Passenger and Cargo Prices Have Both Fallen Sharply</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The competition between British and Japanese shipping in South China is fierce. After the September 18th Incident, except for the Sanbei Company's ships between Fuzhou and Shanghai, the shipping routes between Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou were almost entirely dominated by British Swire Shipping. The routes between Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong were operated by American Dodwell &amp; Co. Since the restoration of the South China routes by Japanese ships in the 23rd year of the Republic, the shipping industries of Britain and Japan have entered a period of intense competition. Currently, on the Japanese side, there are four ships of Nisshin Kisen between Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong: Huashan Maru, Songshan Maru, Lushan Maru, and Tangshan Maru. Between Taiwan, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, there are four ships of Osaka Shosen Kaisha: Fujian Maru, Guangdong Maru, Fengshan Maru, and the newly added Hong Kong Maru. Between Fuzhou and Xiamen, there are Daitoku Maru and Kyodo Maru. This year, a new Japan-Philippines route has been added, passing through Xiamen to the Philippines, with the Chicago Maru and Mexico Maru. On the British side, Swire Shipping has been vigorously expanding its South China routes since last year due to the restrictions on Chinese immigration in British Southeast Asia and the decline of North China shipping. Many ships originally sailing to Singapore and North China have been transferred to the South China routes. An investment of 800,000 yuan has been made in Xiamen to build a new wharf, which was completed last year. Ocean liners can directly dock at the wharf, making it convenient to load and unload passengers and cargo. Moreover, since last year, on the Shanghai-Xiamen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou route, in addition to the original Jinan and Taiyuan, two ships that pass through Xiamen every five days a week heading north and south, four new ships have been added: Qingyuan, Qiongzhou, Guangdong, and Jiaying. Every day of the week, there is a ship passing through Xiamen from Haikou via Hong Kong and Shantou to Shanghai, which is the north-bound route. On Tuesdays, two new ships, Suiyang and Xinning, have been added, sailing from Shanghai via Fuzhou and Xiamen to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, which is the south-bound route. The routes between Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, which were originally operated by American Dodwell &amp; Co.'s Hai Ning, Hai Tan, and other ships, were not operated by Swire. Now Swire's ships also sail to Fuzhou and Xiamen. However, since the British and Japanese competition in South China, a total of ten ships have been added between Shanghai and Xiamen, and the supply exceeds demand, causing passenger and cargo prices to fall sharply. On the Shanghai-Xiamen route, first-class cabins have fallen from 32 yuan to 22 yuan, and steerage cabins have fallen from 8 yuan to 6.5 yuan. Recently, due to a sharp reduction in the transportation of goods from Fujian and Guangdong, Swire's headquarters will suspend the Suiyang and Xinning ships on Tuesdays starting this week, and the Taiyuan and Jinan ships, which operate on Fridays, will change their routes, sailing south through Fuzhou and then to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou. The Suiyang and Xinning ships will be transferred to North China. With the reduction of two ships, it is said that the Qingyuan and other four ships on Mondays will also be changed. (May 24th)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on the Rural Areas of Hubei: Special Correspondent Cheng Jun</h3>
<p>(13) Comparison of Rural Conditions in Sui County and Zaoyang County</p>
<p>The hardships of the farmers in Zaoyang can be summarized as follows: 1. Frequent harassment by bandits from Henan; 2. Intermittent droughts and floods; 3. Exploitation through rents, taxes, and high-interest loans; 4. Rampant local bullies. Fortunately, this year there have been no alarms within the four borders, and the fields have not suffered major disasters. Rents have gradually decreased, but taxes and high-interest loans are still unavoidable. As for the rampant local bullies, it is due to the excessive number of civilian guns (about 8,000 in the county). The current situation is unknown, but in the past, there were indeed instances of oppressing the people. The leaders of each district regiment, relying on their guns, were arrogant. Some had hundreds of guns, while others had dozens. Initially, the regiments were formed to defend against bandits, but later, the regiments recruited bandits. Relying on guns, they raised funds and made it a habit, even committing all kinds of evils. The people could not bear it. Jiang Yuming, when he was the leader of the Zaobei District Regiment, out of personal resentment, led his followers and ordered the two daughters and daughter-in-law of an elderly man named Li to be raped to vent his anger. Jiang fled and the case remains unsolved. Also, a certain brigade of the former garrison, while claiming to be working hard to suppress bandits, levied too many taxes and forcibly collected a five-yuan tax per mu on opium seedlings (which has now been completely cleared throughout the county). When farmers asked to voluntarily remove the seedlings, they were labeled as "lazy" and charged a "laziness tax." Such strange news is unheard of elsewhere.</p>
<p>Sui County and Zaoyang County have long been mentioned together. Let us compare them: The fields in Sui County are more fertile than those in Zaoyang. Sui County has a rent system with few large landowners, while Zaoyang has a land distribution system with many large landowners. The tenants in Sui County bear a lighter burden, but they must provide their own plowing oxen and seeds. The landlords in Zaoyang receive more harvest, but they provide the plowing oxen and seeds. Sui County has no high-interest loans, while Zaoyang has large amounts of high-interest loans. These are the differences. However, suffering from bandit disasters, tax demands, and excessive civilian guns are common problems for both. The old man traveled from Sui County to Zaoyang for 180 li and then traveled 150 li to stay in Fancheng. Along the way, I saw wheat and peas planted everywhere in the fields, flourishing. Within the borders of Zaoyang, they seemed slightly weaker. It is said that there were strong winds and hailstorms a month ago, and many of the wheat seeds in Zaoyang were frozen to death or damaged. Fortunately, the weather has been clear in recent days, and the wheat has been exposed to the sun and is gradually showing signs of life. In the future, it may be possible to harvest 80% of the crop, so the losses are still small. Most of the travelers along the way ride on mules, and grain is mostly transported by mules. For shorter distances, it is transported by ox-drawn carts. Larger towns are all fortified with earthen walls to defend against bandits. One place has stone walls on a grand scale, where large landowners live. There are five landowners who have ten thousand dan of land, and countless more with thousands or hundreds of dan. No wonder they live behind strong walls. Passing by one place, I saw more than twenty stone statues of gods of various sizes on the grassland, as if they were holding a symposium. This place is called Shizipo, popularly known as "the place where Sun Erniang sold human flesh. The statues of gods are of Wu Song, Zhang Qing, and others. Originally, there was a temple built, but it offended the heavens, so it was repeatedly built and burned, and later it was abandoned." This kind of legend is probably attached to the place name Shizipo, just like Wu Zixu and Du Shiyi. Scholars and writers talk about it with relish, which is ridiculous. However, forty li southeast of Zaocheng is indeed the former residence of Emperor Guangwu. The White Water Dragon flew and restored the Han Dynasty. In today's dangerous situation of the nation, it is especially worthy of our admiration. It is a pity that it is not near the main road and could not be viewed. (Sent from Fancheng on May 12th)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Sues Ma Rong: Judgment in the Case of Ma Rong, Ma Rong Hinders Another's Reputation, Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment According to Law</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: General Ma Zhanshan's private prosecution in the Tianjin District Court's Criminal Division against Ma Rong, a 74-year-old man from Fengrun, for hindering his reputation, was announced at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. The defendant, Ma Rong, was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Regarding the part of General Ma's request in the civil court to confirm the absence of a father-son relationship, it was heard by Civil Judge Pei Xijin at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. The debate has also concluded and a verdict will be announced within days. After Judge Hu Guozhen announced the verdict in the Ma Rong hindering reputation case, Ma Rong stated in court that he did not accept it and claimed to appeal. After the adjournment, the court immediately served the judgment on Ma Rong. The original text of the judgment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Criminal Judgment No. 3500 of the Tianjin District Court of Hebei, 24th Year of the Republic: Plaintiff: Ma Zhanshan, male, 52 years old, from Huai'de County, Liaoning Province, residing in the British Concession of this city, Attorney: Lawyer Ji Qingyi. Defendant: Ma Rong, male, 74 years old, from Fengrun County, address unknown, unemployed, in custody. The plaintiff has filed a private prosecution with this court against the defendant for the crimes of hindering reputation and insulting others. This court's judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Verdict: Ma Rong, with the intention of disseminating to the public, narrated matters sufficient to damage another person's reputation and is sentenced to six months imprisonment.</p>
<p>Facts: Ma Rong is a native of Fengrun, with a son whose milk name is Ma Laohu. He escaped in the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the previous Qing Dynasty on an unrecorded date and has not been seen since. Around July of last year, Ma Rong learned that there was a Ma Zhanshan in the British Concession of this city, claiming that he was his son Ma Laohu. When Ma Zhanshan refused to recognize him because the matter was bizarre, Ma Rong filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of this court on July 8 of the same year, alleging that Ma Zhanshan abandoned his parents. After investigation, it was found that Ma Zhanshan was not his son Ma Laohu, and the case was dismissed. However, Ma Rong was still unwilling and on April 23 of this year, he found Ma Zhanshan's residence again, intending to force his way in. After being refused, he publicly declared in front of the crowd that Ma Zhanshan was his son Ma Laohu, and that Ma Zhanshan did not recognize his parents, abandoned them, and arbitrarily fabricated insults to defame Ma Zhanshan's reputation. Ma Zhanshan reported the incident to the police, who arrested him and sent him to the case. While the prosecutor of the court was investigating, Ma Zhanshan again entrusted lawyer Ji Qingyi to file a private prosecution with this court on April 29 of this year, alleging that Ma Rong had committed the crimes in Article 309 and Article 310 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Reasoning: In this case, the defendant Ma Rong only stated, "It is true that I recognized the plaintiff Ma Zhanshan as my son," and firmly denied that he had publicly insulted or defamed the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff Ma Zhanshan is not the defendant's son, and this has been clearly investigated and dismissed by the Procuratorate of this court. The defendant still repeatedly pestered the plaintiff and publicly declared in front of the plaintiff's residence that Ma Zhanshan was his son, who abandoned him and did not support him, and arbitrarily fabricated insults. These facts have been vividly described by the plaintiff in his statement and by his agent Li Huafu in court, and the circumstances of his public insult and deliberate narration of matters sufficient to damage the plaintiff's reputation are obvious. The crimes in Article 309, paragraph 1 and Article 310, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law should be constituted. However, it is found that one act constitutes several crimes, and in accordance with Article 55 of the Criminal Law, the heavier penalty in Article 310, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law should be applied. Considering that he is old and senile and ignorant, a term of imprisonment of six months is imposed in accordance with Article 57, paragraph 7 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 335 and Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the verdict. Judge Hu Guozhen, Criminal Division, Tianjin District Court of Hebei, May 21, 25th year of the Republic of China. This case may be appealed to the First Branch of the Hebei High Court within ten days from the date of service of the judgment. This document is certified to be identical to the original. Clerk Cha Yuanxu, May 22, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>

The association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, which stated: "The telegram has been noted. The re-export tax will be stopped uniformly with other goods. There is no need to discuss the request for early implementation. As for the request to designate a state-owned bank to allocate 500,000 yuan in working capital, it is inconsistent with the bank's regulations and cannot be forwarded. It should be handled by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee."</p>

This matter has been forwarded to the Central Government by the Pinghan Railway Special Branch and our Party Branch Union, and telegrams have been sent. In response to the request of the worker representatives, a discussion meeting was held at the Chinese Seamen's Union at 10:00 AM on the 22nd of this month by the special party branches and unions of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, the Special Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and the Chinese Seamen's Union. It was decided that the Party Branch Union will jointly send a telegram to the railway and seamen's party branches and unions across the country, requesting them to send representatives to Beijing within a specific period to jointly petition the Central Government for an increase in the number of representatives from special trade unions to the National Assembly, and immediately send a telegram to the railway party branches and unions and seamen's district party branches and seamen's sub-branches to participate in due course.</p>

<p>4. All agencies present at the meeting today will jointly submit a memorial to the Central Government requesting an increase in the number of representatives from special trade unions to the National Assembly. The expenses for the petition will be borne by the respective representative agencies. It is recorded that this case concerns the political power of workers and the legislation of the Party and the State. All citizens have the right to suggest revisions and reconsiderations. The National Assembly Representative Election Law promulgated most recently inevitably has the principle of "professional groups taking organizations as the unit" set by the Central Government, and the shortcomings of neglecting the participation of the majority of railway and seamen workers in the election methods. If we remain silent, it would not only fail to live up to the Central Government's emphasis on organizations, but also suppress the political aspirations of tens of thousands of transportation workers. Furthermore, the election of National Assembly representatives is about to be held, and the timing is urgent. In addition to jointly requesting instructions from the Central Government, we hereby specially record this case and send a joint telegram, hoping that you will promptly dispatch representatives to gather in the capital to jointly petition and discuss all matters related to this case, and earnestly pray for timely guidance.</p>

The creditors, claiming that the principal and interest have not been repaid, sued and the court enforced the seizure, and the house has been publicly announced for auction. The gentry of various cities and towns related to Zhabei are outraged and have jointly telegraphed the court to allocate funds for relief in order to maintain the original case of the contract for the establishment of the Ordnance Industry Stone Mortgage by the Superintendent of Jiangsu Province. Yesterday, Shanghai gentry Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and others visited Minister Kong at the Central Bank to appeal on their behalf, requesting that the funds be allocated to clear the debt. The original telegrams from Baoshan County and various cities and towns in this city are recorded below: To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Director Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Chairman Chen of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, and Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government: The director of the Zishan Charity Group in Zhabei, Shanghai, conducted fundraising to maintain local order and pacify defeated troops after the Qilu War. The matter concerns Shanghai and the merit is in the whole country. Unexpectedly, rewards have not been given and lawsuits have been entangled. Wang Binyan has suffered because of official matters, and the council has repeatedly telegraphed requesting that a small portion of Director Wang's private funds be returned to alleviate the urgent need, but it has not been approved. Now the court's seizure of Wang's property has become a reality. The rule of law of the country is difficult to criticize, but what about the truth and reality? The public groups and others in Zhabei are fortunate to have been sheltered and not devastated at the time, which was due to Director Wang's efforts alone. Seeing Director Wang being burdened because of official matters, we feel uneasy. We are honored to be among those who followed Director Wang's leadership at the time, and we are deeply grieved. We dare not take the liberty to appeal and implore your Yuan and Ministry to approve the request of the Wang Council and immediately grant relief. The Yuan Fu grants rescue, and we jointly consult and request the allocation of funds to resolve the outstanding case</p>

<p>Some Points to Permanently Remember After the Memorial Service for Mr. Hu ZhanTang, Chairman Hu</p>
<p>By Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Mr. Hu, a pillar of our party and nation, unfortunately passed away in Guangzhou at 7:40 PM on the 12th of this month. Mr. Hu was one of the greatest contributors to assisting Premier Sun Yat-sen in organizing this party, and at the same time, one of the most dedicated and diligent in creating the Republic of China. His service in various important positions in the party and the nation, and his meritorious and beneficial governance for the people, have been seen in various domestic and foreign newspapers and records over the past 25 years, and are well known to those who care about national affairs and are deeply engraved in their hearts.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's revolutionary achievements during his lifetime were so great, so it goes without saying that Mr. Hu's passing away today is a major loss for our party and nation. We cherish his hard work and hold a grand memorial service to express our admiration for Mr. Hu, and of course, all citizens will shed tears of sympathy and express their condolences!</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hu's revolutionary achievements cannot be fully recorded in a few elegiac verses, and Mr. Hu's revolutionary spirit cannot be simply described in a few brief words. Moreover, the party and national histories will have their own grand ceremonies to commemorate the meritorious figures of the party and the nation, and to inscribe their achievements in the bamboo and silk records, so there is no need for us to be verbose. Therefore, when we commemorate Hu Guang Sheng, we do not need to elaborate on his life and career, nor do we need to extravagantly talk about his extraordinary talents and gifts, but we should cherish his memory from a meaningful and permanently continuous perspective, and we should remember him from the aspects where Hu Guang Sheng excelled and ordinary people fell short. In other words, Mr. Hu's ability to maintain consistency in his work and his ability not to engage in private industry while serving as an official are two points that deserve our eternal admiration.</p>
<p>We believe that success in everything requires painstaking effort and perseverance. Mr. Hu's assistance to Premier Sun Yat-sen's revolution failed countless times. Each failure presented a situation where "things could not be done." However, Mr. Hu followed Premier Sun Yat-sen, repeatedly falling and rising, working harder with each failure, and after countless setbacks, finally achieved the success of the 1911 Revolution. Since our party came to power, the fundamental national plans have been entrusted to important laws and decrees, which have been firmly established through Mr. Hu's many years of diligent management in the Legislative Yuan. In the autumn when the national crisis is increasingly tense and the people's morale is declining, Mr. Hu's "exaggerated remarks" have awakened the deaf and alerted the nation, making the people aware of the need to endure hardship and strive for national salvation and survival. Mr. Hu's calm and strong nature has been developed into a consistent proposition. When we commemorate Mr. Hu, we should permanently remember it as a profound example for progress. This is the first point. Portrait of Mr. Hu ZhanTang, Chairman of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>There are many conditions for being loyal to the country and maintaining integrity, but the most difficult is not engaging in production, which is the so-called true integrity. Mr. Hu served as an official for decades, but he still remained clean and honest, and when he died, he only had a coffin to bury him. The ancients said: "The failure of a family is due to the evil of officials, and the loss of virtue of officials is due to bribery." Mr. Hu was able to deeply understand this principle, maintain integrity, and not acquire private property. This is the most difficult and outstanding point, and it is the second point that we should particularly remember and learn from when we commemorate Hu Guang Sheng.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu has passed away, and from now on, we will no longer be able to listen to Mr. Hu's upright and loyal words. However, although Mr. Hu's body has lost consciousness, his model is still there. We should step up our efforts and learn from Mr. Hu's spirit, be loyal to the country, and complete Mr. Hu's unfinished business, so as to comfort Mr. Hu's spirit in heaven! Condolences to Mr. Hu ZhanTang by Tong Hangbai</p>
<p>When Premier Sun Zhongshan of our party passed away in the 14th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Hu ZhanTang was actually in a leading position in the national revolution. Looking back on Mr. Hu's life, his indomitable spirit, his maintenance of party unity, his promotion of doctrines, his hatred of evil, and his personal integrity all had the demeanor of Premier Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, and were enough to be a model for all comrades in our party. Therefore, in this China where banditry is rampant and powerful enemies are pressing on the border, the sudden loss of this great and lofty revolutionary mentor is an irreparable loss to the party and the country.</p>
<p>Recalling the Qing Party period in the 16th year of the Republic of China, if it were not for Mr. Hu's loyal advocacy and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's military conquest, I am afraid that the historical facts of our party's revolution would have long ceased to exist today. Now, China is facing such urgent foreign troubles and constitutional government is about to begin. Under these difficult and complex circumstances, we firmly believe that the responsibility of our party to save the country and the people will be even greater than in the past. All kinds of problems, such as how to concentrate national strength and how to save the country from danger, are not only related to the life of our party, but also are important keys to the survival of the party and the country. Originally, when Mr. Hu was alive, we firmly believed that under the urging of Mr. Chiang and others, he would definitely be able to take on the responsibility, support the dangerous building together, and open up a broad road. It is a pity that Mr. Hu returned from overseas and was infected by the devil of disease, and he failed to enter Beijing and died with his ambition unfulfilled. This is really the greatest misfortune for our comrades and compatriots.</p>
<p>Although, Mr. Hu's death did indeed lose a leader in the party and a founding father in the country, the great revolutionary cause must not be interrupted because of this. We firmly believe that all party comrades, under the influence of Mr. Hu's personality and morality, and all the people of the country, under the influence of Mr. Hu's knowledge and integrity, will surely be able to firmly establish their beliefs and establish their goals, so as to achieve Mr. Hu's wish to complete Premier Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles. What the historical facts of the revolution have shown us is that in the 14th year of the Republic of China, the passing away of Premier Sun Guang Sheng laid the foundation for the successful Northern Expedition of the National Revolution. The death of Lenin in Soviet Russia promoted the completion of their New Economic Policy. Because of the loss of a revolutionary leader, the revolutionary spirit will never be lost with it. The impact of his death will definitely stimulate the revolutionary enthusiasm of comrades and increase the responsibility of compatriots to struggle. We hope that all comrades and compatriots in the country will be angry and strive hard, unite as one, and under the leadership of the central government, first solve our current enemies and lay the foundation for our national justice.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we comrades and compatriots today remember about Mr. Hu is definitely not just the grand sacrifices and funerals that can be used as the price of Mr. Hu's lifelong revolution. We must understand Mr. Hu's revolutionary spirit, continue Mr. Hu's revolutionary legacy, and inherit Mr. Hu's revolutionary morality to promote revolutionary strength and complete the Three People's Principles of the Premier. This is the greatest significance of remembering Mr. Hu.</p>
<p>As for personal friendship, I had several discussions with Mr. Hu on revolutionary theory in the past. I was fortunate to receive many corrections in my letters. I deeply admired Mr. Hu's precision in analyzing and reasoning, his breadth of vision, and his upright stance. I have long been convinced by him. Even now, Mr. Hu's great theories still exist in my book "Analysis of Historical Materialism and Historical Livelihood," but Mr. Hu has suddenly passed away and will never be able to hear his warnings again. What is even more painful is that Mr. Hu returned thousands of miles at the urging of his comrades, intending to go to Beijing to take office. The people of Shanghai heard the news and rejoiced, and gathered various groups to prepare a grand welcome. I was elected as the director of the preparation. Unexpectedly, the preparation for the welcome was not successful, but now I am preparing for the memorial service instead. What is my personal pain? I also attach a few words to express my grief. Sadness at the Passing of Mr. ZhanTang by Lu Jie</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Gong ZhanTang, a pioneer of our party, unfortunately passed away due to a brain disease after returning from Europe! At a time when the country is in distress and national hatred is deepening, the people of the whole country and the members of our party are looking forward to Mr. Hu's passion of "worrying about the world before the world" and his noble personality, to continue the unfinished great meaning of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, to encourage comrades and inspire the nation, so that the revolution can be brought to a successful end. However, Wu Tian is not sympathetic, and the young people are unkind, and they have taken away Mr. Hu, who has dedicated himself to the country and whose ambition is firm! Alas, it has made our party lose its mentor again, and the country has lost a pillar; when the bad news came, the whole world mourned together.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's death not only increased the losses of the Republic of China, but also gave the posterity a greater responsibility. Thinking of this, I cannot help but wet my blue shirt with tears.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's life's achievements are unparalleled in the world, and the party history will show it in detail, so there is no need to repeat it. However, our mourning for Mr. Hu is not only in publicizing his great achievements, but in remembering the factors of how Mr. Hu was able to obtain these great achievements:</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's achievements were indeed blessed by God, but on the other hand, he also benefited from the cultivation of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's wisdom and the adherence to the Premier's doctrine. In other words, Mr. Hu's attainments were mostly due to his "unceasing self-improvement"; therefore, we comrades can get a clear lesson - that is, those who can be loyal to the doctrine, dedicate themselves to the party and never interrupt, can become a great revolutionary warrior. Mr. Hu is now dead. I hope that my comrades can use the cause of Mr. Hu's success as a mirror for their own self-cultivation. If so, then the first Mr. Hu may die, but the second, third, and even thousands of Mr. Hu can continue to rise up, isn't it the luck of the party and the country's future? Mr. Hu's heroic spirit, if he knows, will also smile in heaven. On the contrary, if we people only dream of Mr. Hu's achievements, but do not work hard, and do not rise up and act, then even if Mr. Hu is there, how can a tree support a building? Isn't this what Mr. Hu would like to hear? What's more, Mr. Hu's greatness is indeed from the unceasing self-improvement to follow the Premier's doctrine, if Mr. Hu did not have the festival that wealth cannot be licentious, power cannot be bent, poverty cannot be moved, how could he be such a complete personality? This is called "knowing shame", so "knowing shame is close to courage". I hope that my comrades, after the condolence, will encourage each other with the great courage left by Mr. Hu. Memorial Oration by the Shanghai All Circles Memorial Public Sacrifice Hu Chairman Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>Solemn Mr. Hu, remotely descended from Hailing. When you were born, the Marquis Star descended. You were intelligent in your youth and even more outstanding as you grew up. You were intelligent and upright, with the stability of a mountain and the depth of an abyss. You traveled to Japan and joined the Iron Blood Alliance. You dedicated yourself to the party and the country and swore eternal loyalty. When the Republic of China was founded, it went through turmoil. Foxes and rats ran rampant, assisting the wise, always in the cabinet. The military government was re-established, and the Northern Expedition was launched. You grasped the key and devoted all your loyalty. You planned strategies and showed a clear reputation. You were ordered to replace the general and received extreme grace and honor. The Premier was promising, and you took on the task. The Premier had words, and you promoted them. Your faith was unwavering, and your understanding of principles was increasingly clear. You relieved difficulties and generously embarked on the Long March. Since the years of Ding and Wu, you have laid the foundation for the new capital. You did not take off your sword, and your body was like holding ice. When you returned to Guangdong, you rode the whale in the sea. After half a year of traveling, you have traveled thousands of miles. The government and the public looked up to you, and the people regarded you as a model. You are a senior member of the party and the country. Why did you leave us? The world swallowed its voice. What time is this? Why did you die? Your spirit was hurt by the sudden robbery, and your heart was exhausted. Your flags and achievements, your bells and inscriptions, cannot be redeemed with a hundred lives. Your fragrant model will last forever. Yang Shukan, Central Committee Member, Memorial Oration for Chairman Hu</p>
<p>On the 25th day of May in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Your old friend, Yang Shukan, respectfully offers humble sacrifices and clear wine as a small offering to the spirit of Mr. Hu Gong ZhanTang. And writes the following: Alas, why did the wise man wither away? Summon the soul in Jiangnan. Only the wise man can judge the difference between the bright and the dark. Can there be different minds between life and death? You came from 90,000 miles away, secretly cherishing this old capital. You have long worried about the country as if it were in danger, but you quickly transformed into a void. In the past, when Xiangshan rose up, a remarkable person descended from the Lingqiao Mountains. You planned strategies in the tent and swore to heaven with righteous banners. In the year of Hai, Mr. Hu died, but your reputation shone brightly in the Jianghan region. You established a government in Baiyue, but who can be compared to Wei Tuo's resignation? You chose to establish a capital in Jinling, refusing Guanzhong and Zhou's rule. I despise Uncle Sun's tiny territory and barely hope for Guan and Ge. Wu and Yue became strong but were weakened. Righteousness was declared in Jinyang. You rushed to fulfill your mission and floated on the sea, but could the Three Divine Mountains be avoided? I loved literature since I was young and valued my worn-out broom like gold. Suddenly, I met you and brushed it off, and we entered the forest arm in arm. We discussed strategies and laughed in the evening, presenting ancient states to satirize the present. You saw revenge with your brilliant wisdom, and we moistened each other under Yingzhou. You returned for three summers but were not used. The banner of righteousness suddenly fluttered in the old hometown. I hope to celebrate Lian and have a descendant, saying that I will see you by my side. After I left and wandered, I almost died upright and went on a long journey. The guest from afar did not hide for long but returned to the central hub. Hoping to dispel my worries, I traveled to Europe. Looking at the endless sky, I leaned on the wheel and faced my illness. In the morning, I visited the islands of Malou and in the evening, I stayed at the Cape of the West. Suddenly looking back and closing the ladder, I thought of the people without a home. Heaven alone gave birth to this upright person, but he was old and had no advantage. I could not destroy the square to be round, and I knew that I was blunt. I believed that deep sorrow hurts people, and I heard that your hair was white. I boiled ointment from the trees and boasted that Taiqiu had a broad path. I alone was humble and still respected sheep, scattered and harmless. The pepper is respectfully displayed, and the fresh grass is like jade. It is a pity that the elegance is suddenly exhausted, and Min will never have spring. I hope you enjoy the offering. Hu Chairman Funeral Committee Shanghai Office Memorial Oration for Chairman Hu</p>
<p>On the twenty-fifth day of May in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Office of the Hu Chairman Funeral Committee, presided over by Yang Shukan and all comrades, respectfully offers seasonal flowers and fresh fruits as a sacrifice to the spirit of Mr. Hu ZhanTang, Chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and says:</p>
<p>Alas, the lofty peaks of the Yue Mountains and the vast Pearl River, between which you were born, raised your literary talent in your youth, and spread your reputation in your early adulthood. Then, assisting the Premier, you endured hardships, and the entire party regarded you as the only center of gravity. Not only was your scholarship profound and your achievements brilliant, but also when you were convalescing overseas, the central government first praised you, and the people led their necks, all sighing that this person would not come out. How could I have imagined that you would come back with illness and your worries would burn your heart, and ultimately many distant wishes would not be fulfilled? Tracing back to your dedication to the revolution, you did not hear the beginning or the end. With wisdom in your grasp and a plan in your mind, from the battles of Chaozhou and Huanggang to the battles of Zhennanguan, you planned and turned the tide, and there was no battle that you did not follow. Deploying troops in Hong Kong and attacking Guangzhou, you were enthusiastic and grand, all due to your planning. Although your achievements were not accomplished, your wishes were slightly fulfilled. Not long after, Wuhan advocated righteousness, and the provinces shared the same hatred, and the Qing dynasty was overthrown. How could there be no reason for this? From this, the capital was established and the calendar was separated. As the chief secretary, you were in charge of the work. The Premier relied on you to make decisions, and the announcements spread like lightning, and unification was achieved. You were ordered to supervise Guangdong, but you declined. The Premier personally ordered you, saying that you were suitable. If you were to fall, I would support you. It was not long before Zhao was instigated to assassinate Song, and Yuan's rebellious actions became increasingly evident. You and the governors of Gan, Xiang, and Wan severely questioned him and launched attacks. Yuan eventually claimed the title of Emperor and suddenly summoned the dead. You exposed the traitors and became a proponent. The warlords and bureaucrats went crazy in the wind, and the codes were destroyed. The hidden tyrants had no light. Expelled by Mo Lu, the banner of righteousness was raised high. The Premier was elected, and the law was prosperous. You were again in charge of the military, and the troops were in the Gan area. Changes occurred in the elbow and armpits, and the villains jumped around. You fortunately escaped danger and fled in a hurry. You made continuous efforts and rebuilt the marshal's mansion. You supported in secret and endured hardships. When the Premier traveled north, you were a pillar of support. The remaining forces clung to the mountains in eastern Guangdong, and the righteous army was newly defeated. When the bad news came, you lost the father of the nation. You carried out his legacy, first supporting your comrades and presenting your troops. You were not afraid of the complexity of politics or the many military affairs. You repeatedly won victories and eventually saw the clouds open and the sun appear. You did not dwell on success, and the Communist Party was rampant. The society was in turmoil, and there was no master to rely on. You suggested cleaning the party and establishing the capital in Nanjing, weeding out the clutter and not being startled. After a short rest in Shanghai, you traveled around the world, establishing the five academies and spending a lot of effort. Legislation should be lenient, and actions should be strict. You recruited many talents and attached seals to the documents. The guests spoke uprightly, and the people looked up to you. You held both party and government positions and did not refuse hard work. You had deep thoughts and far-reaching considerations. The reason was strict, and the governance was tied. You spent countless cold and summer days and did not leave the capital. All of these models have subtle meanings. What you felt in your heart was dangerous, and you were not tired of discussing it in detail. Your righteousness was upright and your words were strict, and you were like a teacher and a protector. And in developing the doctrine, you made extensive references. You were afraid of King Han's poems, and your simplicity was even better. Mount Tai and Mount Hao are scattered everywhere. Suddenly you passed away, and the world was desolate. Your comrades lost a loyal and pure leader, and the people lacked a wise and enlightened mentor. In your dying words, you earnestly hoped for the realization of the Three People's Principles, and there was not a single word that deviated from your personal interests. Even in times of peace and prosperity, I cannot help but feel grief. How can I not lament the loss of a precious and exhausted person in the midst of internal and external troubles? Comrades or elders, or those who have followed you with sticks and shoes, have suddenly lost their elegance. Where can they return? I will choose a sacrifice from the sea, and compare it with the divine platform. Let us be simple and return to the end. Look at these words, and I hope you enjoy the sacrifice. Eulogy for Chairman Hu - Mourning Eulogy by the Shanghai Office of the Hu Chairman Funeral Committee -</p>
<p>On May 12th of the 25th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Hu of the Central Standing Committee passed away, alas! Our Republic was founded, the Three People's Principles were established, and the Premier's legacy was applied to politics. The Chonghua brothers assumed their positions with caution, and Hu Gong was a pillar of the country. Civilized in words, gentle and virtuous, we were about to build a great career and continue the prosperity of the past. Suddenly our luck ran out, and the country's legacy was still there. With unwavering determination, what can our people rely on? Alas! The holy teachings have been passed down, endure cultivation and have no birth, people have passed on but their spirit remains, the model of the ancients, with justice and moderation. Alas, we mourn with sorrow and offer our condolences together:</p>
<p>Ah, our lord was born in Sui City, and his ancestors were from Gushui, the heroes of his hometown. The West River flowed, and literature was formed by morality. When it came to you, you were naturally intelligent and wise, with a deep understanding of morality and art, and nurturing your talents. You had a broad understanding of the classics and a deep understanding of history. You reformed the Gongyang school and believed in it, vowing to change the world at that time. You gathered to write in the mountain hall, debated learning like a raised fist, with an outstanding appearance and a sharp spirit. You knew the classics and governed affairs, and you were able to anticipate and understand everything. You were doubtful about what you heard and asked questions, and you did not fail to compare. You are like Qing and Ke, outstanding in the books, and you take the people as your treasure, and your righteousness is firmly established. After the building was completed, you wandered around, like picking up mustard seeds in the sun, and the emptiness of the microcosm, the great words and the small words, the Jin laws of Lingxue, and the hidden and辩族, were all used to save the people, 明法辅礼, and you were able to use them in times of crisis, and you borrowed to take them all, and then凌抢沧, and then reduced the哲人, and the quiet voice was堂皇,昕合契结, and the words were相羊, and also越兴中,聿纂同盟,击腐摧朽,论难章章,风行神区,慑彼魅僵,粤挈同趣,南蹋瀛海,湛明鼓吹,遹厉辞采,百万侨心,归依有在,密勿旋节,镇南之关,书生戎服,谈笑登坛,利钝遑计,贼胆已寒,吁嗟五羊,脢茸昏庸,公事能忍,乃为前锋,敌百以一,厥光熊熊,至今黄华,满冈英风,武昌声义,公卽开府,与民同政,股肱心膂,越城郅治,人戴其主,而公优悠,劝朴无迕,步行闾市,未易故履,衣菲食恶,众曰微禹,轰轰金陵,奉我首长,以民纪元,统兹泱漭,靑靑天旒,县以昶朗,公达上京,枢密元掌,允文允武,员舆嚮往,告祭锺阜,明陵蠁,凡百典要,导诸否襮,全治北迻,公反南服,大諼肆心,蓜我华族,蓜我主义,逆谋亦覆,魄被天夺,凶焰不禄,公来自东,旋驻宗邦,比及护法,立帜故乡,羽翼左右,元首乃康,亦有议政,炯于非常′旌旗北巡,公摄其幢,明星陨天,使公深悼,刻志铭骨,树谊再造,亡何蹇梗,弗克易暴,乃赋北征,风沙寒颢,妙领缄机,弥坚至道,道在大法,党存义决,特立中央,不挠不折,言山为经,行欲其洁,从政之隙,舒之文词,二山三陵,并兴于诗,托讽以婉,国风之垂,不匮名室,钦哉孝思,诸怯大定,公体颇亏,日月如迈,血潮压之,山川阻修,岂曰勿治,万里遄归,腹置心推,棣己卢存,精诚结维,哀哀苍冥,夺我大师,呜呼袁哉,德冠群伦,言满天下,含气有生,莫不亲炙,严正攸示,郁为教化,斯世有情,公奚遽谢,呜呼哀哉,念彼共人,涕零如雨,神之格斯,照临下士,桓桓中国,爰得我所,景行行止,奉公万古,呜呼哀哉. Eulogy to Mr. Hu by Shanghai Friends and Colleagues</p>
<p>Mr. Hu ZhanTang, due to his long-term illness, sought a meeting, but suddenly his condition became critical, and he gave up his most beloved and dangerous country and the difficult people to return to the truth with me. Mr. Cangzhu's sincerity is deeper than love. Must it be so cruel? It must not be so. But on the tenth day of May in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, he passed away in Guangzhou, the land where he was born and where the revolution originated. How painful! Wang Jingwen was admired by Mr. Jingwen, and his collections in the Lingchuan collection are full of sincerity. The sound and tears are indistinguishable. It is enough to move my Mr. But only Mr. Is it tolerable? It must not be so. Mr. Zhi is the noblest. Mao Yi has not been able to do his best, and the times are different. Colleagues are sad and cut, and they can no longer write. I would like to approximate its outline, in the hope that Mr. Will enjoy this glass of wine, and silently help the country and the people in the future, so that we can die without shame. Therefore, the eulogy is:</p>
<p>Why is heaven and earth so unkind? It is necessary not to make the saint exist, but to make the robber heaven, to destroy the strong, and to correct the weak. Only the public hold the upright and bright operation, the grand and deep thick learning, thinking to make up for the deficiency of the unfulfilled, and the Qiankun is also small. Gonggu Ming knows that he cannot use flesh and blood thinking to resist the most ferocious and brutal people asking the world, and one for the peace to resist the heavens and the earth, and to slightly settle their disturbance, but he must exhaust Gongzhi wisdom and heart to deliver his life, and raise it to follow one moment, Xie Qifan and stand his form. Therefore, the nature of the biting and the clear brightness of the clear brightness, the learning and behavior of the dark and the darkness, the hair in the mystery of art and words, and the establishment of their moral behavior in thousands of years. Alas, why did the world ask such a child? Only the public cannot be healthy and lucky, and are surrounded by this disease. After all, you cannot save the 400 million people who are involved in this body. You will come here and learn from us. Aicai still remembers (Da Chang Yi Ru Ai Ni) Mr. Hu's position in the Chinese Revolution by the Hu Chairman Funeral Committee</p>
<p>When the country is in trouble, Chairman Hu ZhanTang actually abandoned us and passed away. The nation has lost its leader, and justice has lost its advocate. This is an incalculable loss to the party and the country. However, we believe that although Mr. Hu has died, Mr. Hu's spirit is immortal. Mr. Hu's great and lofty spirit still dominates every nation that is forced by dust and every revolutionary people. When we mourn Mr. Hu, we should first recognize Mr. Hu's lofty and great spirit. To recognize Mr. Hu's lofty and great spirit, we should first recognize Mr. Hu's position in the Chinese revolution.</p>
<p>First, Hu Guang Sheng's personality, achievements, morality, knowledge, and articles have all made achievements. He is not ashamed to be a "complete person." At the same time, Mr. Hu is revolutionary. Mr. Hu is a revolutionary leader in China who has gained the belief of the Chinese people through his revolutionary actions. Mr. Hu has the spirit of fighting for the interests of the majority of people. He has gone through the history of fighting for the interests of the majority. He not only guides others, but he himself has a more courageous spirit of fighting than others. Therefore, Hu Guang Sheng is also worthy of being a great revolutionary "complete person" in modern society.</p>
<p>Looking back on the spirit manifested in the history of Mr. Hu's lifelong struggle for revolution, there are about four kinds: no compromise, no opportunism, no speculation, no deception. Mr. Hu possesses these four revolutionary spirits and firmly maintains these attitudes, so his revolutionary position in China has lasted for a long time and is not shaken, and no evil force can overthrow him or hinder him.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Hu firmly believes that the Three People's Principles are the doctrine of saving the country, and thus firmly and unswervingly grasps this revolutionary goal and Zhongyi. For more than 30 years, he has never relaxed his efforts and never used the method of "执中两用" to compromise. This kind of strong perseverance and heroic spirit is actually the embodiment of his profound learning and clear understanding.</p>
<p>What is the revolution of the Three People's Principles? The revolution of the Three People's Principles is a reflection of various contradictions in China's social economy and politics today. It is the actual demand of all oppressed people. It was built by the Premier and inherited and carried forward by Hu Guang Sheng. There are three kinds of Liao forces imposed on the Chinese people, namely "international oppression," "political oppression," and "economic oppression." The so-called international oppression is the oppression imposed on the people of the whole country by imperialism, which has become the national problem of today. The so-called political oppression is the oppression imposed on the majority of the people by domestic feudal forces, which has become the problem of civil rights today. The so-called economic oppression is that the small-scale production system of farmers, workers, and businesses is collapsing one after another, the majority of the people are losing their jobs one after another, industry is becoming increasingly impoverished, productivity is decreasing, exorbitant taxes are becoming increasingly heavy, and bandits and hooligans are increasing, which has become the problem of people's livelihood today. The purpose of nationalism is to overthrow imperialism, lift "international oppression," and realize "international equality." The purpose of democracy is to eliminate feudal forces (such as warlords, corrupt officials, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry), lift "political oppression," and realize "political equality." The purpose of people's livelihood is to build national industries, restrain private capital, equalize the land rights of the people, lift "economic oppression," and realize "economic equality." This is the connotation of the revolution of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>The Premier's 40 years of arduous struggle were to realize such a revolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's 30 years of arduous struggle were also to realize such a revolution.</p>
<p>"Time is not with me." The posterity should learn from Mr. Hu's spirit and strive hard to complete Mr. Hu's unfinished legacy. A Brief Biography of Mr. Hu ZhanTang</p>
<p>Mr. Hu, named Hanmin, courtesy name ZhanTang, and nickname Bu Kui Shi Zhu, was born in the 33rd year before the founding of the Republic of China (the 5th year of the Qing Dynasty Guangxu, 1879 AD) in Fan Yu County, Guangdong Province, originally from Ji'an, Jiangxi. At the age of he studied in Japan, entered the Hongwen Normal College and the Han Zheng Academy University. He witnessed the precariousness of the national power at that time, and then had the ambition of revolution. When he met Premier Sun Yat-sen, he decided to devote himself to the revolution.</p>
<p>In the 7th year before the founding of the Republic of China (the 31st year of Guangxu), he joined the "Chinese Alliance Association" and served as the chief secretary of the headquarters, in charge of the secrets of the alliance. When the Min Bao was published, he served as the editor and lecturer, advocating revolution with all his efforts.</p>
<p>In the 5th year before the founding of the Republic of China (the 33rd year of Guangxu), he accompanied Premier Sun Yat-sen from Japan to Singapore, Saigon, and Hanoi to establish secret military agencies. After the failures of the Huanghuagang and Zhennanguan battles, he presided over the Zhongxing Newspaper in Singapore, propagated doctrines, and united comrades. He also served as the minister of the Southern General Branch of Hong Kong, planning Guangdong affairs with Zhao Boxian, Huang Keqiang, Ni Yingdian, and others.</p>
<p>In the year before the founding of the Republic of China (the 2nd year of Xuantong), in the first month, the Guangzhou New Army failed, and he followed Premier Sun Yat-sen to Penang to convene a military conference; he was then ordered to set up a coordinating department in Hong Kong. In the year before the founding of the Republic of China (the 3rd year of Xuantong), on the 29th day of the third month, the Huanghuagang battle failed, and he planned the aftermath with Huang Xing and others to plan for another uprising. On the 10th day of October, the Wuchang Uprising was the first, and Guangdong announced its independence. He was elected as the governor of Guangdong. In December, Premier Sun Yat-sen returned to the country from Europe and passed through Guangdong, ordering him to follow him. On the first day of January of the first year of the Republic of China, Premier Sun Yat-sen took office as the President and appointed him as the Secretary-General of the Presidential Palace. He resigned in April and then went to Guangdong, and he was re-appointed as the Governor of Guangdong and the Director of Civil Affairs; and served as the Minister of the Guangdong Branch of the Tongmenghui. In this year, Song Jiaoren proposed to change the party to the Kuomintang, but he strongly resigned from the post of Minister of the Branch. In the second year, Yuan Shikai assassinated Song Jiaoren, and borrowed 300 million in debt. He and Li Liejun, Tan Yanzhang, and Bai Wenwei severely protested. He launched a campaign to oppose Yuan and was ordered by Premier Sun Yat-sen to go to Shanghai. In the third year, Premier Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang into the Chinese Revolutionary Party and made himself a pledge, so that he and Chen Yingqi supervised the oath and exclusively served as the Minister of Political Affairs of the headquarters and edited the Republic of China magazine. In the fourth year, he assisted Premier Sun Yat-sen and sent Zhu Zhixin and Deng Zhongyuan to Hong Kong to plan Guangdong. In the fifth year, he went to Xiaoluzong to raise funds, and Chen Yingshi raised an uprising in Shanghai, seized "The 和", killed Zheng Rucheng, and took over the Jiangyin fortress. He was ordered by Premier Sun Yat-sen to go to Shanghai. After Yuan Shikai died, Li Yuanhong succeeded him. He was ordered by Premier Sun Yat-sen to inspect with Liao Chungkai. In the sixth year, Duan Qirui instigated the governor's group to rebel and dissolve the parliament. Premier Sun Yat-sen ordered him to go to Guangdong and Guangxi to promote the independence of the two provinces</p>

<p>Gleanings from the Spring and Autumn Annals (Xiao Bai)  Worry and suffering are humanity's great enemy; vexation is enough to destroy all of humanity's creation and progress.  Because our era is precisely an era of suffering, many people, due to various circumstances, have generated much worry and vexation, and are heading down the path of decline, negativity, and even suicide, which is truly a great mistake.  We must understand that the world needs us to create it; as long as we make resolute efforts, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve ultimate victory.  Therefore, we should use a cheerful attitude and resolute confidence to break through the present difficulties and hardships, replacing "pessimism" with "optimism," and "despair" with "hope," strengthening our physical strength, cultivating our abilities, and creating all things anew.  "Worry can age people," but cheerful confidence can make even the elderly feel young again.</p>
<p>Chiang President’s Happy Pavilion (Hu Weisheng)  Fenghua Xikou is President Chiang’s hometown.  The Happy Pavilion is above Xikou, formerly the Wenchang Pavilion. President Chiang renamed it Happy Pavilion, intending that the elders of Xikou share joy within it. Behind the Happy Pavilion is Mount Wu; on the front half of Mount Wu is a cave entrance called “Wu Ling,” its structure in the style of a city gate. These two characters are from the President's own hand. Mount Wu is commonly known as Saddle Mountain (because it resembles a saddle from afar). The Happy Pavilion is its head, seemingly bowing to drink from the Jin River (because the Jin River is below the Happy Pavilion).  When you sit in the Happy Pavilion and look far into the distance along the road, the rows of towering ancient trees and the beautiful fields and lands across the river, with mulberry and bamboo providing shade, paths crisscrossing, and the sounds of chickens and dogs intermingling, will truly make you forget that you are in the human world…  Between Xinan and the Happy Pavilion, a bay of stream water stretches horizontally, clear as a mirror. People lean on the railing and gaze at this excellent stream, not only seeing schools of fish but also clearly seeing the square, round, and flat stones lying on the bottom, as clear as a painting.  I remember someone once wrote a poem praising the Happy Pavilion's grandeur (probably Teacher Gu). Now I copy it below:  "Verdant pines and cypresses, sheltering jade buildings and exquisite towers;  Seeming like an immortal island of Yingzhou, the pavilions are lofty and grand.  A fairy bridge spans the shore, the Jin River meanders and flows; (Jin River is the same as the Shan River)  Facing the Xinan bamboo grove, ten thousand stalks of clear shadows.  Beautiful, Chiang's residence;  Ah, a land of outstanding people and spirits!"</p>
<p>The Joint Public Burial of Zhu Yuanchu and His Wife (Ya Chang)  Zhu Yuanchu, a poet from Yunjian, and his wife, Ms. Xu Chanxian, passed away nearly ten years ago, and their coffins have long been kept unburied at the Songjiang Gu Shui Dao Institute.  This year, Li Leng, an old friend of Yuanchu, came to administer Songjiang County. Local scholars who had known Yuanchu took the opportunity to initiate a public burial for Zhu Yuanchu and his wife. Li agreed, wrote a solicitation, and publicly requested contributions. This has been going on for several months. As the date of the public burial approaches, Li specially commissioned Ye Chucang to write an epitaph to be carved on stone and erected at Yuanchu's tomb gate during the public burial. The text is recorded below:  "Zhu Yuanchu, a man of Ting; orphaned and poor in his youth, he did not study much but was particularly bright. At the age of ten, he was able to write poetry and lyrics, admired by Yang Xizhang, a respected scholar in his village (Ya Chang notes: That is, Mr. Yang Liaogong. He promoted ethnic revolution through literature in the Yuanchu Society of Suzhou, with countless followers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. He adhered to the High Tang style in poetry, especially liking Gong Ding'an, compiling and arranging his works to the point that everyone had a copy). Yuanchu only associated with Yao Yuanchu, learning the desolate and astringent sounds of the Northern and Southern Song dynasties. Although he was admitted to the society, the members did not approve of him (Ya Chang notes: Yuanchu was initially a member of the Southern Society, which advocated the High Tang style in poetry, while Yuanchu favored the Song style. Disagreements arose, leading to conflicts with Liu Yazi, with each writing articles to attack the other, and Yuanchu was expelled from the Southern Society). Finding himself unwelcome, Yuanchu went to Shanghai, supporting himself by writing. He also worked as a teacher but soon quit. Poor and haggard, unable to support himself, he contracted a lung disease but still wrote fiction daily to earn rice. He married Xu, who lived with her mother in her parents' home, as if he were a live-in son-in-law. He died at the age of twenty-four. His wife also died a few months later, leaving behind one son and one daughter. Nearly ten years after his death, his coffin remained unburied. His friend Li Leng came to govern Songjiang and began collecting funds for a joint burial in the county's public cemetery, commissioning Chucang to write the inscription. The inscription reads: 'His talent was great, his life short; even so, his name will not decay!'"  In the past, when Huang Zhongze died of illness in Jie Prefecture, his friend Hong Zhicun heard the news and rushed from Shaanxi to handle his funeral. Thus, Zhicun's eulogy for Zhongze contained the line, "Although Gong died young, he still had old friends." Some say that Yuanchu's solitary and arrogant personality was similar to Zhongze's, his poetic talent was as vigorous as Zhongze's, and his misfortune was similar to Zhongze's. Therefore, the handling of his funeral by his old friends is also similar to Zhongze's.</p>
<h3>Returning with Praise (Central Virgin) Zhou Xian</h3>
<p>The world is upside down. In this day and age, when marrying a wife, if you still ask if the other party is a virgin, you seem hopelessly outdated. The most popular are women who have divorced their husbands once, twice, or even three times. The more divorces, the more welcome they are. It's no longer an unprecedented event for a woman who just resolved a divorce case in divorce court one day to be discussing marriage procedures with someone else the next.  But on the other hand, it's truly tragic that men are instead valuing virginity. At the very least, you must be a so-called "Bachelor" without family burdens to mingle in social circles. If you bring your wife to a social gathering, the social butterflies will always put on a forced smile to humor you. But that forced smile is still because of your wife, who can mix into the social scene. If you're already married and your wife blushes and stutters when meeting strangers and never sets foot in social circles, then you'll sit alone and be ignored if you go to a social gathering. You'll be isolated and even labeled as having a reclusive personality. On the contrary, if you're an old virgin in your thirties, hey, countless beautiful social flowers will want to be your friend. In yachting parties and other social scenes, you'll absolutely never be lonely.  I have a friend who recently divorced his wife and was pursuing a woman who had just divorced her husband. But soon, that woman fell in love with a certain young man. My friend couldn't stand it and tried to sow discord, telling the young man that she was a remarried woman. The young man said that only a remarried woman knows how to be considerate of her husband. My friend was so angry that he couldn't speak. Recently, I heard that he and his divorced wife have reconciled and vowed not to have any more improper thoughts. It's said that he has realized that he is no longer the virgin that modern women admire.</p>
<h3>Swapping the Nest (Written by Zhang Henshui)</h3>
<p>Chapter 2: Fragrant Grass and Beautiful Women, Ripples Gently Ripple; Bright Moon on a Small Building, Good Dreams Just Begin  Guoqi picked up his teacup, lowered his head, and slowly sipped the tea, seemingly trying his best to appreciate the taste of the tea, focusing all his attention on the tea, so he had no time to reply to Ping Shan's words. Then Ping Shan went to the main room and brought out four colored floral antique porcelain dishes, filled with honey dates, apricot preserves, peach kernels, and hazelnut kernels, and placed them on the table, pointing with his finger and saying, "With such good tea, you must have some good snacks to go with it. This dish of apricot preserves is made from apricots from Badaling in Beijing, a rare thing in the South. I dare not keep it to myself, but share it with you. What do you think of our friendship?" Guoqi smiled and said, "I am very grateful. I think the apricot blossoms in Badaling must be more lush than those in the South. 'Spring colors fill the garden, unable to be contained, a branch of red apricot extends over the wall.' Speaking of this, he tapped his teacup lightly with the middle finger of his right hand, making a thoughtful appearance, and suddenly asked, 'Does the female student you met have an apricot tree at her home?'" Ping Shan said, "I haven't been to her house, so I don't know about that. Why do you ask such a question?" Guoqi smiled and said, "I was just asking casually." As he spoke, he grabbed four or five peach kernels, put them in front of him, and chewed them one by one. Ping Shan said, "Won't you try some apricot preserves?" Guoqi smiled and said, "I have a slightly more advanced request. I appreciate the apricot preserves, but could you let me take them back for my mother to try?" Xiao Shan nodded and said, "This is filial piety. I will certainly comply. Looking at it this way, your mother's determination to raise you as a widow has not been in vain. This brings us back to what we were talking about last night. Your mother's only wish now is probably to find a good wife for you and have a grandson as soon as possible. Since you want to please her, this matter cannot be delayed." Guoqi poured half a cup of tea for himself and slowly sipped it. After finishing that half cup of tea, he smiled and said, "Maybe there will be a chance. I will get married..." As he said this, a maid brought in a lamp. Guoqi then stood up and said, "It's getting late. My mother is waiting for me at home for dinner. This good tea of yours, I only had a quick taste of it today and haven't had enough. Can I come again tomorrow?" Ping Shan thought he was joking and smiled and agreed. He found a paper box, put the honey dates and apricot preserves in it, and let Guoqi take them back. When he saw him off at the gate, a crescent moon hung on the treetops in the corner of the wall, illuminating the ground in the deep alleyway. Ping Shan said, "The moonlight is very good tonight. Will you come out again?" Guoqi said, "I won't come out. Tomorrow I have to get up especially early." Ping Shan said, "What's the matter that you have to get up especially early for?" Guoqi said, "It's nothing, but I want to prepare my lessons early. Goodbye." As he said this, he turned to leave, but after a few steps, he turned back and said, "Brother Xiao Shan, I still have one question to ask you. Do you still have any drafts of that fashion beauty you drew at home?" Ping Shan said, "I don't have any drafts. Why are you so concerned about that painting?" (25)</p>
<h3>Jiang Kanghu Initiates the Great Road Society (Selfless)</h3>
<p>The Great Road Society was initiated by Dr. Jiang Kanghu. A tea party was held a few days ago. Dr. Jiang sat in the chairman's seat, attracting the attention of more than 50 male and female comrades in the meeting. He is a fat man, wearing a Chinese-style long gown made of Liberty cloth. He has a round face and wears glasses. He has one characteristic: when he walks, his left shoulder is higher than his right shoulder. Four or five young women sat next to him.  According to Xu Xiaotian, the drafter of the Great Road Society's proposal, the purpose of initiating the Great Road Society is to organize travel groups to investigate the suffering of the people, study geography and customs. Through travel, they aim to popularize civilian education, promote commercial and industrial enterprises, improve rural production and national defense culture. According to Mr. Xu's opinion, foreigners traveling to China are mostly engaging in aggression, while Chinese people traveling in their own land is a form of understanding, experimentation, and learning. He hopes that everyone will save the spirit of sightseeing and pay attention to visiting the suffering of the people, save the money spent on wine and meat and do more to help society.  It is said that the significance of naming the society "Great Road" is because it is a popular new term. For example, the "Great Road Song," which has recently been broadcast continuously, has penetrated into the people and is easy to remember. However, several of the initiators believed that the name "Great Road" was too abstract and could not fully express the society's purpose. Furthermore, some hypersensitive individuals believed it was a dangerous name and might be banned by the authorities in the future, causing obstacles when applying for registration. Therefore, at the suggestion of some members, it was proposed to change to another better name. Discussions were heated, with everyone expressing their opinions. The building of the New New Wine House immediately became as lively as a prototype National Assembly.  Our Chairman Jiang, who usually has the talent of speaking eloquently, was at this time at a loss as the chairman, almost indefinitely prolonging the meeting period. He proposed many names, such as "Living Road Society," "Walking Road Society," "Opening Road Society," "Pioneering Road Society," and "?? Road Society," advocating removing the word "Great" and retaining the word "Road." However, "scholars revolting never succeed in three years," and it was ultimately difficult to put to a vote. Finally, Jiang Xiaojian proposed to maintain the original name, wasting an hour of debate, but finally resolving the legitimate name of the society first.  Finally, when Dr. Jiang announced the list of directors for the preparatory committee, Dr. Jiang advocated adding two female directors, one being female aviator Lin Pengxia and the other being female educator Li Ruihua. Everyone applauded and unanimously passed the motion.</p>
<h3>Little Spring and Autumn Weekly: Perms (Xia Fei)</h3>
<p>I have never personally experienced the joys of a perm and have always opposed the idea of perming, so even though my wife lived in Shanghai for a long time, she is still a "country bumpkin" in every way, not only not having permed her hair or cut it short, but not even having adopted the slightest bit of modern style.  But now, I have finally supported a perm, although it was not my intention, but I have still done something against my will. Now, every time I touch my curly, loose hair, I feel extremely ashamed!</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhidong (Cai Zhecun)</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenxiang Gong Zhidong, styled Xiangtao, was a native of Nanpi County, later known as the Old Man of Embracing Ice and the Recluse of No Competition. He was endowed with talent, astonishingly extraordinary, and his character was also noble and upright. At the age of fourteen, he received the provincial examination nomination. Later, he passed examinations in succession and held various positions, eventually becoming a provincial governor. His spirit was quite different from others. It was common for him to go without closing his eyes for ten or more days and nights. The staff members who served him took turns on duty, still feeling exhausted. However, he was inherently fond of grand achievements, capable of releasing without considering whether he could collect, capable of creating without thinking about whether he could continue. In middle age, seeing the daily deterioration of the situation, he also organized new policies, but later realized the inadvisability of changing policies, so he published "Exhortations to Learning, Inner and Outer Chapters," and also had a poem expressing his feelings: "Liu Lang does not hate the abundance of sunflowers and wheat, but only hates the brambles that fill the road." Reading this, one can see his sentiments.</p>
<h3>The Straps on Japanese Women's Backs (Sun Linchang)</h3>
<p>Japanese women wear bag-like objects on their backs all year round. When we Chinese see them, we are often puzzled, wondering "what medicine is sold in the gourd?" In fact, what is stored inside is nothing more than some sponges. Originally, in Japan during the samurai era, there were more men than women, so cases of rape and adultery occurred frequently. Women wore swords and knives for self-defense. But fearing that others would find out, they placed sharp cones in bags and tied them on their backs with straps. Later, Japan underwent political reforms and ordered the prohibition of wearing swords and knives. But they had become accustomed to this style of back straps, and removing them seemed to detract from their beauty. Therefore, they filled them with sponges to replace the swords and knives.</p>
<h3>Buying Water (Lan Shan)</h3>
<p>In Cantonese customs, when someone dies, their eldest son must wail loudly while holding a basin, go to a nearby river or stream, bow down, throw in a few copper coins, and then take a small amount of water, called "buying water," to return and wash the face of the deceased. If their home is too far from a water source, they store water in a basin, wail and bow outside the door, and then enter, also called "buying water." Those living in Shanghai often perform the "buying water" ritual in front of the tap in their homes.  Because of this custom, Cantonese people generally dislike saying the words "buying water" together, as if it is the most unlucky phrase. However, women in Jiangsu and Zhejiang often casually instruct their children, "Girl, go buy a copper's worth of water!" This is common, but Cantonese people always feel that there is something "that" about it.</p>
<h3>Folk Song (Ni Xi)</h3>
<p>Meeting in secret, meeting behind the temple, behind the temple someone steals a lover, don't covet your red lips, don't covet your white skin, only covet your curved eyebrows and well-combed hair.  Meeting in secret, meeting with two sisters, which flower is more fragrant? The hollyhock blooms tall but empty, the wooden flower may be small but fills the garden with fragrance.</p>
<h3>"Shooting" and "Short" (Tang Zenggeng)</h3>
<p>In the creation of Chinese characters, many characters are often incomprehensible, not only differing in pronunciation but also completely opposite in meaning. Here, I will try to explain the two characters "shoot" and "short":  "Shoot" is a combination of "body" and "inch." If the body is only one inch, wouldn't it become "short"?  "Short" is a combination of "arrow" and "entrust." If we try to read the two characters "arrow" and "entrust" as a cut-tone, wouldn't it be "shoot"? Moreover, "arrow" clearly represents an arrow, so the character "short" should be read as "shoot" and its meaning should also be "shoot."  As mentioned above, in today's application, the pronunciation and explanation of "shoot" and "short" are completely reversed, and they are misattributed. The incomprehensibility of ancient people's character creation can be seen from this small aspect.</p>
<h3>Going to Jail (Cheng Zhao)</h3>
<p>Father: Bao'er, what were your thoughts when you saw the school flag flying in the air along the way?  Son: Dad, I thought I was going to "jail" again.  Father: Oh...</p>

<h3>The Road to Health: Children's Sleep (Zhou Youren)</h3>
<p>Children's sleep must be of sufficient duration. In summer, they are prone to fatigue, so they should rest more. In the first month after birth, they mostly sleep except for breastfeeding. From two to six months, they can sleep fifteen or sixteen hours a day and night. From seven months to one year, they sleep fourteen hours. From one year to one and a half years, they can sleep twelve or thirteen hours. At two years old, they sleep twelve hours. At three years old, they sleep eleven or twelve hours. At four years old, eleven hours. At five years old, between ten and eleven hours. From six to seven years old, they sleep about ten hours. If they are mentally unwell, they need to increase their sleep time. Parents should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on the Discovery of Endocrinology (Physician Chen Shaohua)</h3>
<p>In 1849 AD, a German named Berthold tried to remove the testicles of a rooster. The rooster then lost its reproductive function and libido. Its comb also disappeared, losing its male characteristics. Later, many scholars, based on Berthold's theory, researched and researched until Brown-Séquard of the Paris Biological Society gave a speech in 1889, revealing the discovery of internal secretion. The audience was shocked. By extracting hormones from animal testicles and injecting them subcutaneously into himself, he obtained unexpected and great effects. His muscle strength and brainpower were significantly enhanced. He also improved gastrointestinal function and increased appetite, laying the foundation for endocrinology and organ therapy. Later generations, based on the theories of these two men, promoted the art of rejuvenation.  In the past few decades, the most outstanding achievements in the study of endocrinology have been made by the German Merun. With his extraordinary intelligence, Merun tirelessly researched for decades, inventing the extraction of hormones from the testicles and ovaries of bisexual sea dogs, seals, lions, and tigers, respectively, to produce "Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nü Rong" for women. These two drugs are used for general neurasthenia, such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, easy fatigue, weak memory, palpitations, insomnia, dizziness, muscle relaxation and emaciation, irregular menstruation in women, leucorrhea, and infertility in both sexes. They can always quickly transform the glandular tissue system, rapidly curing the above-mentioned diseases. They can also make muscles fuller, the spirit more lively, and suddenly show the vibrant appearance of youth. Therefore, "Bu Ti Kang" and "Bu Nü Rong" quickly became popular around the world and were greatly welcomed by both men and women. Merun's great name will also be eternally remembered! In our country, tens of thousands of men and women have taken these two drugs and recovered from sexual neurasthenia and infertility.</p>
<h3>An Assessment of Transmembrane Sterilization in the Treatment of Gonorrhea (Dr. WEICHABDT's Experiment)</h3>
<p>Among venereal diseases, syphilis and soft chancre are not to be feared, but the treatment of gonorrhea is the most difficult thing. Because gonococci invade the urethra deeper and deeper with each passing day, gradually spreading to other parts of the body, although drugs for treating gonorrhea are like bamboo shoots after rain, they only act on the local area and do not have the definitive effect of completely eradicating gonococci. So-called transmembrane sterilization, in addition to physical therapies such as electricity and anti-gonococcal serum therapy, it is truly rare to find an oral drug with this effect. Because the drug must pass through the stomach and intestines, the one with bactericidal power must contain frost-like ingredients. Once taken, the stomach and intestines will be damaged and systemic poisoning will occur. The gonorrhea is not eliminated, and life is in danger. Since Bidel advocated using the body's natural resistance to directly kill gonococci, the method of treating gonorrhea has been completely renewed. The German "Kelin Nong" holy drug for driving out gonorrhea has achieved the greatest success under this chemicalization and experimentation. European scholars and doctors are vying to use it, because this drug stimulates the body's resistance antigens, promotes the increase of white blood cells, and produces a powerful bactericidal effect. Therefore, gonococci, no matter where they are hidden in the body, can be quickly killed. All acute and chronic gonorrhea and inflammation of the prostate, testicles, joints, and bladder can be completely cured within a considerable period of time. According to Dr. Weichardt's experiment, male and female patients who take this one drug from beginning to end, about six or seven bottles to ten bottles, can be permanently cured and will never recur. However, when purchasing, you must seriously pay attention to authenticity and accurately identify the three characters "Kelin Nong". You must not listen to others and purchase cheap, miscellaneous, inferior drugs, deceivingly entering the body, causing disease changes and life-threatening dangers after taking them. You must be careful! "Kelin Nong" is indeed a unique good medicine in modern times - Translated from the German Popular Medical Report.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Clinical Report on Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. Consulting hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.  The Most Easily Overlooked Gonorrhea Gonorrhea is less likely to infect the opposite sex during the acute phase. When it becomes chronic, the degree of pain decreases, and because they cannot endure the abstinence of time, they have more contact with the opposite sex, but they still dare not be licentious. However, there is a type of chronic gonorrhea in which the surface shows almost no symptoms of gonorrhea. The urine is also clear, the same as before the illness. Only after working and engaging in sexual activity will there be lint-like strands of gonorrhea appearing in the urine. It is often at this time that they transmit gonorrhea to their wives.  Moreover, because gonococci are usually attached to the urethral mucosa, they are sent into the vagina and uterus during ejaculation, causing wives to develop uterine gonorrhea or vaginal gonorrhea, which is also a common occurrence. For example, I once treated Mr. Ni Wenbing, who suffered from gonorrhea for three and a half years. The surface symptoms seemed to have completely disappeared. After a certain period of overwork, he engaged in sexual activity. Within a week, his wife's gonorrhea flared up, her genitals ulcerated, and leucorrhea flowed like a spring, causing her to cry and fuss all day long, disturbing the entire family. Later, through the introduction of a colleague, she asked me for treatment. I diagnosed her with gonorrhea paraurethritis. In addition to X-ray and electrical radiation therapy, I also instructed her to take German Kelin Nong internally and use urethral irrigation. After more than a month of treatment and five follow-up visits, she was completely cured. Her leucorrhea was also treated by me with "Cadillac vaginal suppositories" as suppositories to reduce inflammation and stop leucorrhea, and "Kelin Nong" was taken internally to eradicate gonococci. Within four weeks, she was completely cured. The couple then underwent blood tests, proving a negative reaction (i.e., no gonorrhea reaction), and happily thanked and left.</p>
<h3>Stomach Diseases and Intestinal Diseases (Li Fumin)</h3>
<p>The stomach is responsible for digestion, and the intestines are responsible for absorption. The stomach and intestines are essential organs for digestion. If the stomach is diseased, digestion will be poor, and nutrient absorption will also be lacking. Therefore, the body will be weak and prone to illness. On hot days, the stomach and intestines are particularly susceptible to disease, causing cholera and other dangerous symptoms.  Therefore, special attention should be paid to the condition of the digestive organs on this day, and stomach medicines should be taken to improve health. I have confirmed through frequent years of experimentation that the German "Strong Stomach Essence" is a remarkably effective drug for acute stomach diseases such as vomiting and nausea, chest pain, chronic stomach diseases such as belching and acid reflux, bloating after meals, intestinal diseases such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, constipation, loose stools, and excessive gas. This drug is most effective because it contains a large amount of spleen extract, which nourishes blood and brain, stimulates the appetite, and aids digestion. It also contains precious life vitamin AD, a good tonic for weakness. It also contains vitamin B, which can treat beriberi and weakness, and can also treat constipation and addiction in the elderly and smokers, because the medicine is rich in lecithin. The medicinal properties are pure and good, which other medicines cannot match.</p>
<h3>Management of Hot Weather Leucorrhea (Jin Yueren)</h3>
<p>Women are most afraid of heat, especially those suffering from leucorrhea. In hot weather, the amount of secretion increases, and it exhibits a unique odor. Not only are others unhappy when they smell it, but the patient herself also experiences mental discomfort, physical fatigue, drowsiness, and even lower body erosion, with leucorrhea and blood flowing together, menstrual irregularities, and difficulty conceiving. The German "Cadillac Vaginal Suppository" can effectively stop secretion, heal erosion, and completely cure it. If leucorrhea is caused by physical weakness, "Bu Nü Rong" can be taken at the same time. If leucorrhea is caused by a husband transmitting gonorrhea, "Kelin Nong" can be taken internally. Both internal and external treatments are more effective.</p>
<h3>German Gonorrhea Special Medicine: A Realistic Experiment of Kelin Nong (Sheng Zaiqiang)</h3>
<p>(1) Acute Gonorrhea Cured Patient Mr. He Pingshu, 22 years old, came to me for treatment in the first week of suffering from gonorrhea. Seeing his haggard spirit, as if he had lost sleep for several nights, it can be seen that his pain was deep. Urination was stinging, and there was a lot of thick purulent discharge. The foreskin and glans were inflamed and painful. I instructed him to take "Kelin Nong" and use it to wash the urethra. Two weeks later, the inflammation was reduced. I instructed him to continue using "Kelin Nong". After taking it for a week, urination was smooth and painless, and the disease was completely lost. The reason why Mr. He's disease was cured so quickly is that he sought treatment immediately after the onset of the disease, and "Kelin Nong" has good transmembrane sterilization, which can quickly eliminate gonorrhea, so it can be effective quickly and shorten the duration of the disease.  (2) Orchitis Patient Mr. Zheng Xiwen, 29 years old, married. He had previously suffered from gonorrhea, but because he was repeatedly mistreated, it turned into orchitis. The right testicle was swollen, making it difficult to walk. Blood was seen after urination, and there were many gonorrhea strands. Because of his long illness, he transmitted gonorrhea to his wife, causing her to have a constant stream of leucorrhea, local erosion, and pain. I begged for treatment. In addition to ordering him to rest and wear a jockstrap, I also instructed him to take "Kelin Nong" to remove gonorrhea and relieve pain. He continued to take it for three weeks, and his illness was 60-70% gone, and the swelling and pain of the testicles had subsided. He continued to take it for two weeks before it was completely cured. His wife's leucorrhea was treated with "Cadillac Vaginal Suppositories" externally to remove the leucorrhea, and "Kelin Nong" was taken internally to eliminate internal gonococci. She also took it for three or four weeks and recovered.</p>

<h3>Dr. Deng Yuanhe's Clinical Experiment Record of Lung Disease</h3>
<p>Clinic Ningbo Road, Sichuan Road Intersection Consulting hours 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM  Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Sputum, Hemoptysis, and Weakness The research on the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis has made great progress in recent years. In particular, since Dr. Sato advocated that lime has a special relationship with this disease, scholars have repeatedly invented methods for treating calcium agents. It is common to see articles published in various magazines, and there are more and more products of calcium preparations. In order to seek the absorption of the disease, the increase of nutrition, and the improvement of physical fitness, it is even more difficult to choose the perfect one. Generally, preparations only play a part of the effect, only reducing the symptoms! After many tests and experiments, the German "Bu Fei Nare" is indeed a good calcium preparation combined with ideal and experiment. I have received great help from it clinically, and I will only briefly describe one case:  Patient: Xu Renpu, male, 29 years old, teacher.  Symptoms: At the age of 21, he had pleurisy. In early May of the 20th year, he had a large amount of hemoptysis due to strenuous exercise. Several days later, he had a cough, sputum, night sweats, and increased heart palpitations. Then there was anemia, fatigue, and a slight fever of 37.5 degrees. He had insomnia, many dreams, frequent nocturnal emissions, back pain, and a thin body.  Diagnosis: Resistance in the apices of both lungs. Wheezing sounds were heard on auscultation. The percussion sound was short and dull. It was diagnosed as apical catarrh.  Treatment process: First, Tinct. lpeca, Codein Phosph, and other agents were administered, and he was ordered to rest in bed. Although the fever decreased, the symptoms remained the same. I then instructed him to take "Bu Fei Nare". After taking it for two weeks, the wheezing sound in the apex of the lung disappeared immediately, and the cough decreased. Because I instructed him to continue taking it for three weeks, his appetite increased greatly, and there was no more fever and sweating. He then automatically continued to take it with peace of mind. I also instructed him to take German "Bu Ti Kang" to treat nocturnal emissions, insomnia, and other weakness symptoms. After a month, his vitality was greatly restored, his spirits were refreshed, and his weight also increased, just like a healthy person.</p>

<p>Shen Bao This Local Supplement Discusses Fashion Shows (Jian Ping) It is now the transition between spring and summer. Because of the changing seasons, everyone pays attention to changing clothes. The noble women or young ladies who decorate the prosperity of the metropolis are most active at this time. It is said that with these people, the city will prosper and the economy can recover.  Therefore, Shanghai, as one of the world's prosperous metropolises, really needs this work of decorating the metropolis. This is also the reason why "fashion shows" have become popular recently. The fashion shows held by Sincere Company and Wing On Company not long ago were only equipped to meet the needs of the petty bourgeoisie, but now a foreign department store is a bit different. A certain newspaper recorded this fashion show, writing two cautionary words in the title</p>
<h3>National Products Movement Exhibition Opens Yesterday</h3>
<p>Various Circles Enthusiastically Visit; Exhibition Scheduled for Three Weeks; Declaration Issued Urging Compatriots to Use National Products</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Movement Exhibition officially opened at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Penglai Market. Wu Kaixian, a member of the municipal party committee, presided over the unveiling and flag-raising ceremony. Numerous dignitaries and ordinary citizens attended the event. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Exhibition Hall Arrangement</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition is located at the west end of Penglai Market on Penglai Road, with entrances on the east, south, and north sides. At the entrance, a cypress archway is erected, with a white cloth banner hanging above, reading "Shanghai National Products Movement Exhibition" and "Urge All Citizens to Unanimously Use National Products." On either side are couplets that read, "Local treasures and natural gifts are all displayed in this exhibition hall; fellow countrymen, please come here quickly to visit and learn." Inside is the exhibition hall, with over two hundred participating businesses and factories. All kinds of daily necessities are available. Exquisite domestic products are scattered like stars, with a dazzling array of colors that is overwhelming to the eye. To the west is the lecture hall, with party and national flags hanging around. At the entrance are warning slogans that read, "Promoting national products is the first strong army to resist humiliation; self-reliance is the only way to save the country." On the lecture stage, there is a portrait of the Prime Minister, with party and national flags crossed on either side. Next to it is a couplet that reads, "What year is this? The year citizens promote national products; pleading to all citizens to unanimously use national products." "What day is today? National Products Movement Day; begging male and female compatriots to quickly turn back and change their minds."</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Those who attended the opening ceremony yesterday included: Wu Kaixian, member of the Municipal Party Committee (represented by Wang Manyun); Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Commerce; Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Council; Hu Xiyuan of the China General Chamber of Industry; Zhang Yichen of the First Special District Citizens' Federation; Chen Jiufeng and Liu Zhongying, members of the Citizens' National Products Year National Products Movement Committee; Wang Hanqiang and Zhou Bangjun of the China National Products Manufacturers' Federation; Tao Leqin and Ge Futian of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession; and guests from all walks of life, including Kuang Zhongmou, Huang Mengtuo, Shen Tianxin, Wang Jingdong, Zhu Yangwu, and others, totaling thousands of people. Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Gengtao, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Jicheng, Wang Manyun, Wang Hanqiang, and Zhou Bangjun served as the presidium of the conference, with Chen Jiufeng as the master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities, Wu Kaixian, representing Wang Manyun, raised the flag and unveiled the ceremony amidst music. Then, Liu Zhongying reported, "Distinguished guests, this exhibition was jointly initiated by the Citizens' National Products Year Movement Committee and the China National Products Manufacturers' Federation. After a long period of preparation, we are finally able to meet with you. We are very honored to have you attend. There are more than two hundred participating manufacturers, which is unprecedented in previous national exhibitions. Although we cannot say it is the last, we can say it is the first. Its significance lies in the fact that the people of the country have a deep understanding of national products. At a time when foreign insults are becoming increasingly urgent, we know that promoting national products is the only way to save the country from danger. Therefore, after the opening of this exhibition, we hope that all sectors will provide more assistance in promoting it, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches</p>
<p>Next, Wang Manyun gave a speech, saying, "Since the smuggling of private goods in North China, a large number of foreign goods have suddenly appeared in the market. Our tariff autonomy has been breached, and small industries are on the verge of being unsustainable. Therefore, if we want to save the country, we should be determined not to sell or buy foreign goods, so that even if foreign goods can be smuggled and dumped, they will have no way to use their skills again." Next, Zhang Yichen gave a speech, briefly saying, "To revitalize industry and commerce, first, producers must intensify production efficiency, and consumers must be determined to promote national products." Shen Tianxin, Wang Hanqiang, and Wang Jingdong then gave speeches successively, followed by art performances.</p>
<p>General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>The meeting also issued an opening declaration, the original text of which reads: "This meeting meets the world amidst the rampant smuggling of private goods. This is not a cause for celebration. A nation must have a foundation to stand in this world, and that foundation is economic protection. The tools of protection are customs and national defense. If national defense is not strong, the forces that destroy our national economy can come as if entering an unpopulated area. If customs are ineffective, private goods that destroy our national economy can also come as if entering an unpopulated area. Who is doing this? Who is causing this? All people who do not love to use national products should be held responsible. This meeting meets the world, or may be considered a decorative act, but its effect, if only 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai recognize the importance of its relationship and the breadth of its influence, and all use national products, then national defense will be strengthened in part, and customs will be effective in part. If there are meetings like this one throughout the country, and if all 450 million people across the country recognize the importance of its relationship and the breadth of its influence, and all use only national products, then national defense will naturally be strengthened, customs will be effective, and how can there be forces and private goods that destroy our national economy coming as if entering an unpopulated area? Fellow countrymen, please understand that if our national economy does not restore its protective strength, the country will have no way to stand, and can individuals still survive? This is a special declaration, for your public consideration."</p>
<p>Telegrams to the Whole Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Movement Exhibition telegraphed the whole country on its opening day, in order to awaken compatriots across the country to compare and use national products, so as to achieve the goal of saving the country with national products (details omitted). At this time of increasingly urgent international political situation, the whole country is competing to take self-reliance as the path to liberation, and the national products movement is the most basic work of self-reliance. If the whole country can actively promote it with one heart, then imperialism will lose its reliance on exploiting the Chinese people, and the recovery of our national economy and the revival of the nation can be expected soon. Since the opening of the maritime ban, imperialism has used its industrial superiority as a backing, and unequal treaties as a cover, to dump goods, monopolize the market, and erode our national economy to a great extent. By the time the September 18th Incident broke out, the four northeastern provinces had been ravaged by iron hooves, resources had been lost, and the market was shrinking. As a result, domestic industry and commerce became like the setting sun, precarious. Those who seek to destroy us are taking pleasure in destroying our country and exterminating our race, gaining an inch and making it worse. They have also connived at wandering people, evading taxes and smuggling. According to customs estimates, private goods are now rampant, spreading from North China to the provinces in the Yangtze River basin. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but shudder. The government's tax revenue directly suffers losses, not to mention the national industry and commerce in the wind and rain, which is even more dangerous to be attacked by this shocking wave. I think that at this time when the country's lifeline is about to be cut off, promoting national products and self-reliance is not enough to save the country and survive. This meeting has gathered well-known national products manufacturers to publicly exhibit and give the people of the country the opportunity to recognize, criticize, and purchase national products, in order to promote national products and maintain the national economy and people's livelihood. I only hope that the promotion of the national products business depends on concerted efforts and unity of will. I hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together and jointly shoulder the mission of saving the country with national products, which will be the fortune of the nation and the country.</p>
