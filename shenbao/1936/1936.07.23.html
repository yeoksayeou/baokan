<h3>各省市商會代表會議閉幕</h3>
<p>各省市商會聯席會議。今閉幕矣。本屆會議距上屆幾及十年。此數年中。工商業之處境彌艱。遭遇彌酷。外則經濟侵略。咄咄逼人。內則農村復興。遙遙無期。此雖為整個經濟問題。非局部解决所能收效。然亦不應以其艱難險阻。而遽聽命於人。故此次各省市商會代表聯席會議之舉行。誠工商業自覺之一表現也。</p>
<p>此次會議歷時三日。為期雖短。然所議决各案。如檢查走私貨物。如久未解决之合夥債務淸償責任問題。如裁廢變相厘金。緩徵所得稅。皆與工商業有直接利害關係。循是而行。雖未能於積極方面振興工商業。而消極方面之防護。亦可維持工商於不敝。蓋休養生息。固振衰起廢之道也。茲請就議决各案擇要論之。</p>
<p>上海雖為全國商業之第一道防綫。然如後方空虛。前綫亦難鞏固。今之走私。皆襲後方。後方應有嚴密之組織。前方庶可免後顧之憂。各商會旣為各地工商業之代表機關。防化走私。又正有賴於各地工商業之自動。若不為之販運銷售。且糾察嚴密。處置公允。私貨將不攔而自絕。故此後走私能否杜絕。將惟此次所籌設之各地檢私委員會之力量是視。</p>
<p>年來工商業疲憊不堪。人盡知之。廢止苛雜。裁撤厘金。所以為昭蘇計也。然以各地方財政拮据。所謂「變相厘金。」猶難盡廢新稅頒行。負担更重。夫賦稅出自民。今之所以財政困難。正為民窮商困之故耳。內地商業。自農村破產。水旱頻仍。並有匪亂之結果。逈不如前。人民購買無力。商品積滯不動。資金動向都市集中。週轉旣澀。市面自益凋零。而營業稅也特種稅也。房捐也。所負担者。就其目前之能力以為比較。已覺艱巨。况今於營業稅外。復課以所得。雖所得取諸盈利。非一般不論盈虧皆須負担者可比。然一年卽有所餘。皆從開銷節省而來。稍事擴大。難免支絀。加以內地商店帳簿組織。粗疏簡陋。將來舉發隱匿。審核純利。糾紛正不知何若也。</p>
<p>合夥營業之責任問題。爭論已久。就法理言。自以合夥財產。不足淸償合夥之債務。各合夥人對於不足之額連帶負其責任為公允。就事實言。有限公司股東之責任。旣以其所出之資為限。而在公司事業未發達前。商業組織。仍以合夥營業占其大多數。勢不能一律迫令改組。按立法本意原在保障債權人之利益。不知事實常得其反。因需連帶負責之故。合夥人中之有資力者反不肯出其應納之資。靜待事態之變遷。其結果訟累經年。奔走調解。債權人之所得。或不能償其所失。假如不足之額。准以按股分担。為完其責任。自愛者當無不樂於繳納。其不照出者另定嚴厲之制裁。債權人亦得請求法律以為救濟。且因合夥人所負責任之重大。遂使有資力者視經營工商業為前途。悉索資金。存放於外。內地金融愈感枯乏。果能稍輕合夥淸償之責任。則於工商業之投資。當亦不致如以前之趦趄不前也。</p>
<p>雖然。凡此尙非商會之本身問題也。竊以為今日各地商會所最宜注意者。要為如何發揮其精神。蓋商會非以圖謀工商業及對外貿易之發展為其宗旨乎。際此貿易入超。莫由自拔。出口商品。依然故吾。外力侵入。日深一日。手工業失敗垂盡。新工業無由代興。工商界之泄沓如故。精神之散漫猶耆。而一般商人。猶視團體為其應付官廳之工具。至於業務之改進。事業之興創。則輒深閉固拒。雅不欲麥入集團之力量。且亦不願其過問。以是不但對外貿易未嘗收發展之益。卽工商本業亦豈有發展之可言。故此後工商業能否健全發展。其機捩實繫於工商團體之組織能否健全也。</p>

<p>南巡佳話</p>
<h3>人多地少的江山</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者石英</p>
<p>從衢縣到江山、乘晨開汽車、一路靑山綠野、美景應接不暇、公路用碎石築成、雨天照常可開、浙贛路併行其旁、常得參觀汽車和火車的賽跑、由這裏公路的未植道旁樹、忽然想到浙南的公路、兩旁「問株楊柳問株桐、「車行疾駛其間、從柳隙中常常透出幾畝蓮池、像在西湖蘇堤上兜風、不覺有什麽僕僕風塵之苦、一會兒到了江山、入城宿達昌旅館、它是用祠宇改修成的、屋高透風、尙合暑天居、還有江山旅館、資格也很老、其餘多為小客棧、全城更無一個好澡池、</p>
<p>江山城南二十五公里、有江郞山、山上復有三石峯、挺然高挿上空、高度皆數百尺、可仰觀而不可攀越、本縣卽以此得名、城郊還有鷄公山與老虎山、也是幾片奇怪大石、堆立山頭、一似鷄冠、一似伏虎、（實際却很像伏臥着的駝峯駝頭）、在城中抬頭一看、恰可看見他們的類似部份、卽鷄頭與虎首虎尾、突起仲縮於街簷屋角上、江山民性强悍、盜匪殺傷案、差不多天天發生、特別是道個暑天、常有槍斃匪犯的慘劇、縣政府門前不敢擺人力車、怕的就是呌他們拉犯人去殺塲、風水家把這樣的事、歸罪於老虎山的生像不好、雖然迷信的人很多、實際却是這奇山怪石、沒有眼睛生錯了地方、才蒙受不白之寃、</p>
<p>江山以一邊僻小縣、訟案特多、這是事實、據地方法院主管人談、該院自民國十七年成立、由縣府移來積案一百數十起、中有積至兩年多、不會審判的、眞是寃枉得很、每年受理訟案統計、自一千餘案、現增至一千五百案左右、平均每日受理四案以上、而釗歸縣府審理的盜匪紅丸犯、還不在內、若通統合而分析、第一類是强盜罪、的占百分之四十、（另據縣長談、漸已增至百分之六十）第二類傷害罪、占百分之三十、第三類妨害自由罪、占百分之二十、第四類紅丸犯、占百分之十、此外危害民國罪的共黨犯、數年前僅有二人、可見犯罪人以危害國家公安為目的極少、而關於經濟性質的强盜犯、幾占二分之一以上、第二類傷害罪的犯罪原因、多因收租收債起、也可以說大部份是為了生活問題、其他各種犯罪動機、也不免直接問接帶些生計問題、</p>
<p>江山現時在監人犯、縣府計二百人、法院除假釋八十餘人外、還有二百八十餘人、合計將近四百人、以有容限的監獄、收禁激增不已的人犯、管理給養、都常發生問題、兼之無知愚氓、偶罹法網、或因惡性犯人所教唆、愈趨墮落、或因病疫傳染、以致誤死於獄中的、聽說為數也不少、這樣邊僻的小縣、竟有如此衆多的案犯、而且默察將來、還有每况愈下的危機、茲略述各情如决、希社會加以汴意、</p>
<p>這問題的主要原因、第一、民性比較强悍、這是無可否認、前年大旱、浙江曾轟傳一段城的新聞、農民强迫縣長、向隍行禮求雨、後來還搗毀黨部、把農會會長拖出去烤太陽、——這幕滑稽劇、就是這裏江山人拌演的、早幾年還鬧過一次米荒、農民亦羣趨縣府要挾、那時有位姓米的新縣長、剛接印一日、被逼不過、怒曰、「我只是姓米、幷不曾把米帶來、米在米行、來鬧什麼」、於是他們把各米行一搶而空、米縣長也因這米問題而馬上撤差、羣衆强悍如此、私人亦頗不弱、東南兩鄕、尤其二十七都·十八塢兩地、有所謂「耕」「搶」兩幹的農匪、譬有弟兄四人、兩三人巳經因搶案槍斃了、其餘的還依然要操那不用本錢的冒險生意、至少他也要把報案的人殺掉、</p>
<p>第二、錢塘江中的箭頭船、前以江山船占最多數、船戶的計一萬戶、航行運貨至此、分運閩贛皖三省的挑夫、經常亦有四五千人、四山通生着茂密葱綠的野竹、居民靠造紙為生者、計紙槽百多付、槽工一千數百人、總計船戶·挑夫·紙工三項、共有五六萬人、現因交通發達、船夫挑夫完全失業、紙工也因為東北銷塲的斷送、長年無所事事、「衣食足而後知禮義、倉廩實而後知榮辱」、這大批失業羣中、當然有不少的分子是增長攘奪之風的主角、</p>
<p>第三、全縣人口、計二十九萬、耕地僅三十餘萬畝、平均每人僅得一畝零二三分地、不及最低限度每人三畝之數、如此「生之者寡、食之者衆」、無怪陷入「樂歲終身苦、凶年不免於搶刦」的環境、普通租地耕種、地主的得六成、佃戶僅得四成、究因地少人多、不得不爭種以糊口、年來實行二五减租、（卽佃農按收穫量、先取二成五、然後與地主平分、計佃農得六·二五成地主得三·七五成）、對一般半自耕農及佃農、頗有助益、以前半匪化區的農民態度、幸多因此轉好、惟食糧不足、仍無法彌補、據黨委宋日隆君近由二十七都（距城一百二十里）等地視察歸來所談、「各鄕食米的僅占百分之五、食番米及其他組食的、占百分之四十五、其餘百分之五十、都是樵採野草（又名苦葉）煮吃、」這便是一個鐵證、</p>
<p>上述三原因、再分析歸納一下、「人多地少」、可以說是總癥結之所在、試看歷史上的一治一亂、莫不以人口與土地問題為背景當耕地空曠、人口稀少的時候、農民家給戶足、於是「天下昇平」、嗣因人口激增、耕地不敷分配、人民日感食糧缺乏、再遇飢饉、流寇蠭起、於是「天下大亂」、殺人盈城盈野、直至人口死亡大半、人心亦已厭亂、幷得出傑人才、撥亂反正、使災祲餘生的人民、分得死去大半人的剩地、力耕豐收、家給人足、復又呈現太平的景象、今後科學進步耕、種制度改良、此種周期性的慘劇、不至再重演也未定、但目前江山的人多地少的危機、却非常可怕、所謂民性强悍、便因為苦辣的生活之鞭、將他淬礪鞭擊而成、至於失業羣的束手無策、更因生活園地太狹、無法安挿、這都是顯明的事實、亟欲解决這問題、惟有「實行移民政策」、贛東的橫峯弋陽閩北的蒲城建甌、類多收復赤區、往往數十百里的良田，至今依然一片荒蕪、果由江山移民、朝發而夕可至、望當局勿空口宜傳、及早實行為幸、</p>

<h3>工部局衛生當局談　夏令避暑方法</h3>
<p>日前本埠為熱浪所襲、甚苦酷暑、室中靜處、尙覺喘息為艱、而在驕陽下奔走者、幾如置身爐火之上、致中暑猝倒者、數見不鮮、公共租界衛生常局對於袪署之方、曾有文字發表、茲特擇其要點、譯之如下、諒亦大衆所樂知者也、</p>
<p>查上海天氣、夏中雖多酷熱、但時有暴風雨之間隔、故居民對於袪暑之方、並不視為至要、但在近熱帶之地、如何袪暑納凉之方、人人皆知加以硏究而遵守之、故吾人處於酷暑之日、能稍知防熱之方、固亦夏令衛生之要著也、查日曝、中暑、及獰倒等症、醫家聚訟紛紜、莫衷一是、有謂日光中能引起化學作用之光綫、根本不能射透腦殼或脊骨、故常人所稱為日曝症者、科學上實無存在之點、而日盔遮背、以及種種禦日之物、俱屬無需之物、持此說者俱有醫學上之證騐、振振有詞、使常人無從加以辯駁、但在他方面、凡人受日光之蒸灼、而致局部炙傷者、除局部痛苦之外、全身之系統、亦不同感不寗、故從普通公共衛生方面而言、卽使日曝症在科學上無存在之餘地、而日光之侵襲、實不可不加以防禦、蓋此不僅可以防止皮膚一部份之刺激、而因身體受熱過甚所引起之重要病症、亦可因此而預防也、</p>
<p>日盔因其質厚而不透熱、故儘可採用、而黑色眼鏡、尤為保護目光所必需、但東方人對於墨晶鏡之需要、並不如西方人之甚、因西人之眼網膜色淡、易感受太陽光綫之侵襲也、再則空氣中之水份、與身體之舒適與吾極有關係、故在較為乾燥之空氣中、因人體之汗、揮發較速、故雖熱而並不覺不適、反之、空氣之濕度已達飽和點、人體上之汗不易揮發、卽立覺其煩悶、故夏季日中或午夜寂靜無風之時、最應愼防中暑、再則據印度某專家考騐之所得、溫度降下過速、亦易促成中暑猝倒之病、而夜中安睡、可以增加體力使明日禦然之力增强、</p>
<p>往往人之身體、長期受炎威之壓迫、神筋中管理體熱之機械、卽不勝其煩悶、而於不知不覺中、放棄其抵抗工作、於是出汗及其他維持相當體溫之機構、卽宣吿解體、此時但覺全身煩熱而汗止不出、此卽為中暑之先兆、切宜愼防、但亦有因空中水份已充滿、人體上之汗、無從蒸發而促成中暑者、故在工塲之中、使空氣乾燥流通、實為夏日當務之急也、</p>
<p>此外復有個人於夏日所應守防暑之規則數條、為美國畢資堡城衛生當局所頒佈者、茲特節錄如下、（一）衣著宜力求輕鬆適體、（二）由熱處入冷處切宜加意、（三）多飲冷（開）水、（四）食不可過飽·（五）敗不潔之物勿入口、（六）勿發怒、（七）應稍運動、但勿過用力、（八）凡事但求中和、（九）每出須戴帽、（十）體力腦力及情感皆應撙節、以上各條、多飲水是否有益、須依各人之體質而定、但東方人原有之俗諺「日不下山不飲酒、」允應行之於夏季、而日中盛熱之時、允應使筋肉弛放、最好於凉室中安臥片刻、亦所以增加抵抗力之道也、故夏日午餐休息時間能稍延長、實甚有益、</p>
<p>近數年來有人於工塲中實騐、凡工塲濕熱之地、工人因長時間之工作、汗流浹背、因而體中鹽份减少、可於飲水中加食鹽少許以資補償、據云採用此法後、工人對於炎熱可减少許多感覺、但吾人須知、一人之食物、或卽他人之毒藥、水中加鹽是否、有益無害、須視各個人之體質是否相宜、恐不宜普遍行之也、再則關於衣著方面、夏日男子最苦、蓋男子衣著如領、如褲帶、如袖、皆使人苦其束縛、廢棄此數處之束縛、今日尙非其時、但襯衫領口、應擇其尺寸較大者、以資舒適而使、空氣流通、至衣著應如何改良、是則另一問題矣、</p>
<p>夏日最可羨者惟女子、輕綃霧穀、固不必言、卽一襲紗裳、亦勝男子多多、况女子靜處室中、身心自閑、不必如男子之奔走衣食、驕陽烈日、亦祇可任其炙灼也、</p>

<h3>防霍亂事務所發表　霍亂預防步驟</h3>
<p>居住問題甚關重要</p>
<p>上海防止霍亂臨時事務所、昨發表霍亂之預防步驟云、關於霍亂之預防、潔水供給、預防接種、食物管理、蒼蠅滅除、及個人衛生等、固為緊要、但居住問題、亦甚重要、不應對之忽略、蓋貧苦之人、若無衛生便利、則自不能明悉健康之道、仍多採溝渠之汚水、作淘米洗菜滌器之用、為改良此種環境計、市府曾於過去三年中、在市內建築模範平民村四處、每處均有廣場、以為市民游息之所、其房舍租金極廉、由三元至四元之間、大都租與勞苦階級、該平民村址、計有中山路·普善路·其美路·大木橋·等四處、此數與上海市民需要相比、實係渺小之發端云、</p>

<p>通俗講座貫高  蘇子涵　　張耳跟著漢高祖打天下，很有攻勢。漢高祖得了天下之後，就封張耳做趙王。張耳死了他的兒子張敖嗣位。漢高祖的大女魯文公主嫁給張敖做王后，所以張敖又算是駙馬。　　漢高祖八年，高祖到平成去，從趙國過，張敖是女婿，對高祖很恭敬，但是高祖對待張敖却很不好，簡直是換來呌去的，張敖都忍受了。　　張敖的臣子，貫高趙午等十幾個人，平常都是把氣節看的很重的，看見漢高祖這樣待張敖，不覺氣衝斗牛，說：「我們的王爺簡直太懦弱了！太懦弱了！」於是大家都跑去見張敖。　　見了張敖，貫高就說：「高祖待王爺太無禮了。高祖雖然得了天下，但是只要有豪傑出來，只要有人才去輔佐這位豪傑，高祖的天下也未必坐得穩了。王爺對待高祖是多恭敬，高祖對待王爺是多無禮，我們眞氣不過，不如殺了高祖，就此起事，準成得一番事業。王爺意下如何？」　　張敖聽了，吃驚不小，趕忙說：「諸位說錯了。先父把國家失了，全靠高祖，才把國家恢復，子孫能保守王位，都是高祖的力量。我不能忘恩負義，背叛高祖，諸位不必再說了。」張敖說着，又把手指伸進嘴裡，咬出血來，立誓道：「我至死不反高祖！反了就同這手指一樣！」　　貫高等見說不動張敖，就推下去，互相商議道：「王爺是對的，我們錯了。王爺是忠肝義膽的人，絕不會忘恩負義的。我們氣不過高祖對待王爺太無禮，想殺他：殺了他，豈不是把王爺的聲名弄壞了。但是我們仍然氣不過高祖。我們就這樣辦吧，仍然等機會去啥高祖，事成了，就奉王爺起事，事不成，我們去傾罪就是了。」　　貫高等商量好了，只等機會來，便動手。　　漢高祖八年，高祖從東　向長安，打趙國過，貫高等知道，就在柏人地方設下埋伏，等高祖再那裏過夜的時候，便動手。高祖起初本打算在柏人縣過夜，後來不知怎的，又不在那裏過夜了，一直走去。於是，貫高等的埋伏計就失敗了，只好再等機會。　　貫高有仇人知道了這事情，就跑到長安去上表，說張敖君臣謀反，這時已經是漢高祖九年了。高祖就派欽差去捉張敖君臣。　　欽差到了趙國，宣讀聖旨已畢。趙午等十幾人知道事情敗露，大家都抽出佩刀來抹脖子。貫高見了，怒駡道：「一個人做事要敢作敢為，我們做的事，我們去領罪就是。但是王爺不知道這事情，現在連王爺也一起捉去了；我們都死完了，誰提王爺去明這不白之冤？我們應該同王爺一道晋京去才是。」　　欽差說：「聖上有旨，張敖的門客那個敢同張敖一道晋京的，就殺他三族。」　　貫高說：「殺三族也不過是那末一回事，替王爺明冤要緊。我要同王爺一道晋京。」　　貫高裝作張敖的僕人，一道到長安去。　　到了長安，丟進天牢。　　第二天，廷尉升了堂，先提貫高去問。　　廷尉說：「你把同張敖謀反的事情實說了，免得皮肉受苦。快說！」　　貫高說：「謀反的事全是我幹的，設埋伏殺高祖也是我幹的，因為我氣不過他對待功臣太無禮了。要殺要剮，領罪就是。王爺一概不知，我不能亂說。」　　廷尉說：「張敖眞個不知道？」　　貫高反問道：「你難道要我冤枉好人嗎？」　　廷尉說：「謀反的人有甚麼好的。不拿點苦結你吃你也不知道利害，你也不會招的。來人，拖下去打」。　　武士們如餓鷹抓雀一般把高拖翻在地，打了兩千刑杖，貫高沒有口供。廷尉又教武士們剝了貫高的衣服，用香火燒背，燒得皮肉直響，貫高仍然沒有口供。這樣打了又燒，燒了又打，直到貫高身上已經沒有地方用刑了，仍然沒有口供，廷尉只好呌武士們把貫高抬下去。　　廷尉把貫高的情形奏明漢高祖。漢高祖不覺嘆息道：「眞是好男子！好男子！有誰直到他的，私下裏去問他，也許可以問出一點頭緒來。」　　中大夫泄公出班奏倒：「臣同貫高認識；他是趙國的義士，說一是一，說二是二，從來沒有失過信，許多人都知道他。待臣去問他罷。」　　漢高祖說：「你如果問出來了，是你的功勞。」　　泄公到了天牢裏，呌禁子把貫高抬出來，擱在地上。貫高仰起頭來，看了看，說道：原來是泄公嗎？　　泄公說：「貫先生，是我，你還沒有忘記我呵！」　　貫高說：「那會忘記呢。泄公，你也誒有忘記我呀。」　　兩個寒暄一陣，泄公才問；張敖眞不知道謀反的事嗎？」　　貫高說：「泄公，你又來了，那個人不愛自己的父母，自己的妻室兒女？現在我的三族都定了死罪，王爺如果知道謀反的事，我供出王爺來，我的三室豈不是都有活命了？無奈王爺眞不知道，全是我同趙午主謀幹的，我不能冤枉王爺，該殺該剮，全是我一個人去承當好了。」　　泄公說：「這話是眞的？」　　貫高說：「泄公，我們是多年的朋友，你還不知道我嗎？我那能說假話。」　　泄公也知道貫高說的是眞情實話，就別了貫高，去見高祖。　　漢高祖聽了泄公約回話，很佩服貫高，讃嘆道：「眞是個好男子！能夠做我的臣子，就更好了。」一面呌人把張敖取來，說：「朕現在已經知道你不知情，你便沒有多大的罪。」隨卽把張敖放了。　　漢高祖又呌泄公到天牢裏去，告訴貫高，張敖已經放了。　　泄公到了天牢，見了貫高，就恭賀道：「貫先生，告訴你一個好消息，張王已經放了。」　　貫高驚問：「眞的嗎？」　　泄公說：「眞的，誰謊你。」　　貫高不覺異常高興，說：「謝天謝地，王爺沒有罪，也不枉我辛苦這一趟了。」　　泄公說：「還有可喜的事呢，聖上很器重你，要大用你呢。」　　貫高說：「這就不對了。我在趙國不自殺，拼著身子牢裏來受苦，不過是想替王爺明這不白之冤。現在王爺的冤已經明了，已經放出去了，我的事情便完了，就死也沒有怨恨，也瞑目了。並且一個做臣子有了謀反的聲名，這是多可恨的了，多慚愧的事，還能再做臣子嗎？高祖就是不殺我，我也沒有面目再活下去了。煩你轉告王爺，貫高只能這樣報答王爺了。」　　貫高剛一說完，就回過手去，下起勁的搯着自己的咽喉，泄公打開牢門去救已經來不及了，貫高死了，不久，俠義之名便傳遍天下。張敖雖然沒有被冤殺，却也貶做宜平侯了。喬治伊斯特曼（George　Eastman　1854）  果軒　　—軟片發明家　　近代擴影術的進步是很驚人的，不但以照相為業的商店，技術在日新月異的炫奇爭勝，就是以娛樂消遣為目的的業餘私人攝影家，也都有很奇妙的技巧。早先以照相為「留個紀念而已」的眼光現在已完全打破，大家用藝術眼光來批評，鑒賞：來取景，製片。恰如我們看一幅名畫一樣，我們用種種攝影上專門的講究來衡量一幅影片了，不信，你還看得見一個端然敬坐得「冠麼之顰」，旁邊配上自鳴　茶壺茶　等陳設的「追影式」的像片嗎？我們見到的人像，在水濱，在林中，在花前，在月下，總之一個自然而有趣的活的人生全可以從照相機裏跑出來，而供我們欣賞了。　　一具輕妙攝影器，可以隨你旅行到天涯海角，只要你的軟片帶的足用，你可以把熱帶一直到寒帶的景物都陳列在目前的，這我們不能不感謝科學給我的恩惠。還有呢，無聲的有聲的立體的各種電影，在你當「星期尾」已經疲乏了的時候，他會把你的精神恢復過來：那我們更得念照像術的好處。進來戰爭的空氣如此之濃，我們的敵人到處攝險要　得影片，飛機翱翔在天空也在幹著這準備工作，然則我們說攝影機也有與大砲戰耀一般的力量，或亦未為不可了！因此，讓我來談談一段改造攝影機械使牠能充分利用的科學及。　　他是誰？就是美國柯達（Kodak）公司的創辦人喬治?依斯特曼。　　　　先得說說攝影術的進步概況以便引入本題，攝影術完全是根據物理和化學的原理而成立的，使外界的景物通過透鏡而結像於照相器後邊的感光片上，這種感光片使用玻璃或　造成的，上面塗了溴化銀，溴化銀的感光性極強，只要有極短時期的曝光，因明暗不同就會起變化，外面景像　上之後，用顯像水把他洗出，這是片上明暗正和實物相反，再用塗有感光藥的像紙　在下面一曬，用藥水把他洗出，定住，就是我們所照出的像片了。攝影術自發明到現在，已有一百多年，在這百餘年中不知費了多少科學家的心機才改進到現在的地步！早在一八〇〇年時，已有人證明銀墮的感光性，後來有兩位法國科學家，正式發明了用銀　感光攝影的方法，（用銀板塗上碘化物，曝光後，再用水銀蒸氣顯影）他們的名字是達格爾（Daguerre）和泥阿普司（Niepce）那時已有一位科學家呌坡爾塔（Ｂ?Porla）的，發明了照相用的暗箱，不過彼時洗曬一張像片，手續非常紛繁，還不是人人都能作到的事，只算作科學上的一種實騐罷了。一八五一年，亞邱（S?Arclier）才發明用玻璃作的濕片，已與近代用的乾片近似，唯係現作現用，不能久留，故名濕片，比較現今所用的乾片，其不便是可想而知了。　　　　正式製成近代近攝影乾片的，卽依司特曼。他於一八五四年七月十二日生於美國紐約附近的奧奈達，後來又移居羅柴斯特市，他父親在到處創立了一個商業學校，算是個職業教育的先進。但是半生辛苦，並未見若何成績，而家境也日見貧困起來，這位老依司特曼先生，就在潦倒中死去，遺下他的六歲兒子和太太，在辛苦艱難中打發無　的日子！　　貧困的依斯特曼，十四歲已竟失學了。為生活的鞭策，他道某保險公司當一名茶役，每週的工資　元，銀子雖然很少，但在他看來，已足可是他的家庭過着小康的日子，依司特曼用錢非常儉省，一年之內，他竟儲蓄了三十餘元美金。公司裏因他為人誠實可靠，不久，把他的年　增加到六百　，依斯特曼采了這個機會，更大大發揮他作事得能力，於是極得公司總理的信仰，他就被調到某銀行充會計主人，年金增加到一千元。　　這個生活使伊氏的狀況一天天對的好起來，幾年後，他因身體健康關係，請假療養，而她一生偉大的發明工作，就在這時起始了。　　他為養病起見，　美國風景最好的德敏哥島上去，臨行時有一個當機械師的朋友勸他：「你何不帶一架攝影機玩玩呢？御也有趣呀！依司特曼一時動了興致，立刻買了些講照片的書籍來研究，並學習自造濕片應用，但因這種笨重的器械旅行時帶了極不便當，他就生了改良的動機。恰好，這是英國雜誌發表了馬島克斯（Maddox）卜蓋司（Burgess）諸人研究乾片製造的結果，遂引起他從事製造乾片的決心，病也不癢了，銀行職務也想辭却，他要專心來製造乾片，可是他的經濟狀況又不允許他，於是他只得白天上銀行，夜間悶在斗望裏埋頭研究，。當夏天到來時，空氣熱的像凝結了一般，製造乾片，又絲毫不許透光，你可想象他那密閉的小屋中空氣是何等惡濁！何況銀　的味道，多半奇臭非常，白天工作了一天的伊斯特曼，晚上却又呼吸着這樣的氣味，這種辛苦，在一般好求舒適的人看來，是如何的傻瓜！但伊氏却賦有發明家特有的堅忍不撓的精神，除去平常日子以外，他在星期日也不外出，反而加緊的工作起來。後來終於因他母親的勤苦，才允許每星期六晚與家人聚餐一次。　　八個月以後ｉ，伊斯特曼已是瘦得不能支持了，灰白色的面孔，眼睛周圍深深印上了一層黑圈，本來這種過度的工作如何是一個血肉之軀的人所能忍受的呢？他咬了牙，他用堅硬的態度應付別人的訕笑，用更緻密的思索來對付他的工作，他吧藥科加減損益，設盡種種方法使他塗到玻片上能立刻乾燥，也不曉得失敗了若干次，結果在一八八0年十月中旬伊司特曼式的幹片居然在市場上與人相見了，他博得了偉大的榮譽，因為這種東西實較濕片不知要方便到多少倍，這時他不過廿六歲。　　金錢隨了他的聲譽而來了，他的出品，在市場上得到最大的銷路，狹小的家庭工場已是供不應求，一八八一年，他向銀行辭職，在柯達克街設一小規模的公場，命名為伊斯特曼幹片製造公司，不久他的營業，已達每月五千元。困窮的伊司特曼，一躍而為小資本家了。　　但是，意外的打擊使他又陷入痛苦的深坑裏，幹片在市場上的銷路忽然減小了，原因是經過一冬，乾片的感光力顯減，有的甚至失去效用，於是議論紛紛，大家都駡伊斯特曼的發明是騙人的玩意兒。　　伊斯特曼只得掩旗息鼓的收拾了他的工場，從此市場上也見不到「乾片」！從先會有過一度繁榮的羅柴斯特市柯達克街，如今又為陳　的荒涼所籠罩，過此地者，無不大生感慢。他們以為伊司特曼從此不會再見了。　　在各種報紙的譏評訕笑中，原來伊斯特曼已竟偷偷渡過大西洋去英國研究光學和化學去了！以這樣一個偉大的發明家，我們可以想見西洋人的處心態度，這一點的確使我們東方人該取法的！他到一個攝影研究院」作樂研究生，把他從所製的乾片重新用科學方法加以剖析，以求改良之道，幾月以後，他已獲得了新的鑰匙，結果，又製成一種極有把握的感光敏銳且可耐久的乾片。　　一八八二年六月，伊司特曼帶了他的新發明和希望回答祖國，立刻把他的新方法公告出來，並設廠製造，保證已經改良了先前的缺失，他的營業果然又復與起來。次年他又發明用膠質製成的軟片，比起玻璃乾片，又便當多多！這就是今日我們所有的膠卷和軟片包：而後來愛迪生發明電影，也是借了膠片的力量才能成功。　　一八八八年，他又發明了簡便的柯達攝影器，使他的效用大大的增加，而且携带便利，價格低廉。我們現在花幾塊錢就可弄一架鷹眼鏡箱玩玩，這都是伊斯特曼的詞與啊！　　柯達克公司營業一天天發展起來，他設立了柯達克攝影研究所，廣聘世界上有名的化學家物理家，以期改進出品，同時發刊柯達雜誌，俺就攝影技巧，并作為他的出品的宣傳刊物。這雜誌現在銷路仍是很廣！　　一九一九年，他將六百萬元的公司股票分配給全場工人。以後每年要提出百萬元的紅利，分給全體職工。我們由此可見他的思想與只知剝削工人的資本家是大不相同的，這種遠大的眼光，也許是他成功原因之一吧！當我們買一匣Kodak的膠捲時，請你不要忘記這位偉大的發明家！出版界「高爾基傳」  清水　　凌志堅編　正中書局　　以一個貧苦的未受過正式學校教育的木匠孩子，憑著自身百折不撓的堅強意志，與惡劣的社會環境奮勇搏鬥，一躍而為世界文壇巨擘的高爾基（Glky　1868-1936），現在是長離人間了，一百六十歲種著述聲譽，眞是震驚了全世界，誰都不會忘記他的。俄國的革命創造者列寧反復地贊美高爾基道：「高爾基同志的偉大的作品，　成了他和俄國以及全世界的工人運動之間的聯繫。」「這是無疑的，高爾基賦有巨大的才能，那已經替全世界的無產階級的運動盡了很大的力，而且還會繼續盡下去的。」「高爾基無疑地史無產階級藝術的最偉大的代表者，他已經有過很多的貢獻，而以後一定還會有更多的貢獻吧。」吉爾波丁為高爾基的「創作四十年紀念」而作的「偉大的高爾基」，是以這樣的諛詞結束他那篇文章：「四十年來馬克西姆?高爾基總是站在社會主義鬥爭中的最前綫，站在無產階級的文化革命的領導者的前哨。全世界的無產階級，以無產階級為領導者的廣大的勞苦群眾，用愛和敬意向他們的偉大的無產階級作家致敬禮，並且祝他的　富的作品與年俱進！」與他携手向前的法國大文豪羅曼羅蘭更這樣的大加讚頌他：「那個高爾基差不多是歐洲的唯一的人，無論如何，他是最先而且最澈底地給那些高貴的人們一個可譏笑的榜標，那就是，一個在藝術界名有望的人，一個偉大的知識者，一個偉大的作家，拿他的天才，他的聲譽，走入革命的陣營裏面來，從堡壘的另一邊，向西歐的智　分子致意，而我也跨過了那堡壘，而且握着高爾基的親熱的手。由此，可以見到高爾基的崇高和偉大，至若他在那四十年紀念大會中的盛譽與榮幸，簡直是震動了整個天地，震驚了整個世界！　　然而，現在，這一代藝人是這麼的長眠了，我們除了說這是全世界文化上的損失外，可還能夠取得到其他的話來說麼？　　　不朽的人是死了，我們怎樣去紀念他呢？這自然最好是拿他去年紀念巴比塞的幾句話：去紀念他自己：「追悼這位反對世界卑劣事件的戰士的蘇聯青年作家們，不能不有幾倍的人來塡補巴比塞殘留着的空席，不能不從自身之間，養成幾十個像巴比塞那樣的戰士。一不錯，這是最切實最澈底的說話，實非這樣做不行的。但是，我們要塡補他的空席，須了解他的為人，明白他的行事才行。一樣的，我們要養成像他那樣的戰士，也非澈始澈終的了解他的一生，知道他的偉大在什麽地方不可。因此，我敢請大家去讀讀這本「高爾基傳」。　　這是薄薄的一本書，祗不過是十二章一百五十頁的一本小書而已。編者凌志堅君，可說已注意到讀者的興趣問題，能夠以一枝生動的筆，寫得這麼不易，暢曉，而又生動。高爾基的童年的家世，是寫得這麼的周詳，外祖母外祖父的不同的模型和故事，更美麗的敘述出來，令人讀之發生同感。高爾基，他自己兒時的頑皮，跟外祖父吵架，批着外祖父的鬍子，這個事，寫得尤其是栩栩欲活，如見其人，如　其事。　　還有，他那永遠陷在貧苦中求生求知的奮鬥的經過，也敘述得不枯燥，不晦澀，而流利曉暢，一如童話故事般的便於誦讀，那在做盡師學徒時深夜讀書的一大段慘痛的故事，紆曲綿密地敘述出來，最足以見人世間的殘酷，最足以見他那不屈不撓的與惡劣環境鬥爭的偉大的人格。自然，在無名作家時代的掙扎的經過，他那起伏的心情，他那周遭的人物，也有露骨的描寫。至若他那成名後參加革命，接近群眾，問濟貧苦，提拔無名作家，……等的忠誠眞摯的行誼，一樁樁的敘述出來，是這麼的有條不紊。四十年紀念的光榮的經過，概述得有聲有色，只此一段，已夠使人對此最革命最前進的，擁有絕大多數的讀者與群眾的高爾基，而崇拜備至！　　名人傳記最足以感化人，陶冶人，令人奮發，其力量是非常大的。這書唯一的缺憾，就是太偏於敘述高爾基偉大的健全的人格，於其作品內容的介紹，過於忽略。應有的著作表或譯作表，也沒有把牠附在篇末，我以為也是美中不足。再版時間倘能加以補充改善，那可說是一本最好得名人傳記了。新書業的衰落及其前途  顧鳳城　　我們要檢討新書業所以衰落的原因。應當先從牠的興盛時代說起。　　中國新書業的興起是伴隨着新文化運動而來的，自從五四運動以後，中國的社會起了整個的變化，新思潮如排山倒海般的灌進古老的中國社會，於是，專門印行新思潮書籍的出版機開，就一天發達一天。　　最初，新書業專門出版標點書，從前許多藝小說經過一度的改頭換面，就風行一時，一向被老先生所不屑的「水滸」，「紅樓夢」，「儒林外史」等，這時穿了新裝站在新青年的案頭了。後來標點書愈出愈多，有幾家新書店就出起文藝創作來，那時上海的泰東圖書局，以創這社為中心，北京的北新書局，以語絲派為中心，是新書業的二大營壘。　　那時的創作小說正適應當時社會的需要，出版後自然風行一時，如魯迅的「呐喊」，郁達夫的「沉淪」等，成為多數青年愛讀的書籍。因為那種書籍在內容方面是反封建的，如魯迅的對於封建社會的諷刺，郁達夫的大胆的性愛描寫，形式方面是白話的，所以受到當時一般青年的熱烈歡迎。　　經過五卅慘案以後，青年的反帝反封建的情緒更為熱烈，創造社出版部成立，以革命的浪漫主義為號召，出版的書籍最為青年所歡迎，郭沫若的「落葉」，張資平的「飛絮」等，均銷行至十餘版之多，那時的書局，無論出版什麽創作，袛要內容有些革命的口號和戀愛的穿插，那麼，初版二千本是閉了眼睛可以銷去的，這是新書業的黃金時代。　　國民革命軍北伐以後，社會由極度的動亂又漸漸地趨向安定，許多青年從戰場上歸來，深深地感覺到革命不是專靠一時的熱情所能成事的，在實際工作的體騐中，知道理論的重要，於是有許多青年從浪漫的熱情的空氣中轉而趨向於實際的理論的研究，因此，社會科學的書籍就迫切地需要起來，於是那時的新書業就從文藝書的刊行轉到社會科學的刊行。甚至有專門出版社會科學的書店，如聯合書店。平凡書局，麗崙書店等產生，那是民國十七八年的時候。　　但是，不到二三年，社會科學的書籍却日漸衰落下來了，原因是有下面幾種：第一，當時的社會科學書籍大多數是從日文翻譯過來的，那時候翻譯的技術還沒有現在的進步，有許多讀者把日文直譯過來，一般讀者都看不大懂：第二，社會科學書愈出愈多，形成千篇一律，而許多重要的著作如「資本論」等，却並未出版，讀者始終限於大中學生，不能擴大開去，一般的讀者仍嫌高深，專門的讀者並無特別的名著新書可以參考研究，於是，社會科學書籍的銷路，就日漸縮減下去了。　　後來，長江方面發生了空前的大災，讀者的購買力又為了經濟恐慌而更形削减，同時「九一八事變」，失去了廣大的東北市場，新書業在這種狀況之下，袛得轉向中小學教科書，參考書，以及兒童讀物方面去了。專門刊行新書的北新開明等都注全力於教科書參考書的刊行，以專門兒童書為目標的兒童書局也開辦起來。　　但是，這種書籍到後來也愈出愈多了，市場並未擴大，讀者並未增加，而關於此類書的出版却層出不窮，因此銷數也日漸减低了。　　繼而又有雜誌年翻譯年等等來刺激讀者，但新書業的日漸衰落，是鐵的事實，去年年底有好幾家書店的收賬甚至不到一成（譬如放在外埠賬款一萬元，年終結帳收回不足一千元，這是何等　重的事實啊！（未完）啟事　　張天佑，珧華，張星海，實，清水，鍾怡詣先生公鑒：請將最近通訊處，並附具印　，卽日函告上海辣雙得路五百號出版界編輯部為盼！　　編者謹啟。</p>

<p>康健之路色素淋劑之得失  陳少華醫師　　自本塔氏創製色素劑以來，愛而理西氏對于淋病治療有何確效之發表，皆為一般所習知者。然而欲調劑靜脈內注射時，稍以不慎，其效力則大為減弱，此為此一般醫家所壞苦之　。況色素之品質極其駁離，未經幾格之煉製，殊不宜妄用，故甚少以此應用于內服劑上者。其後經過希魯　兒氏研究，及加以特殊之化學手積消毒，作為淋病內服劑而果奏卓越的效果，諸家報告　多，不過此尚俫試艌性質，惟自彼得氏正式創製成為「克淋儂」後，淋病始有確切可靠之色素劑，此實為淋藥之母，其效力則握消炎　痛，只要「克淋儂」一種，「克淋儂」以外，皆不屬于純色素治療之範圍。病家於此須注意及之。　　「克淋儂」之治績，與常樂特異，一經投服，可在數星期內收跟治之效（事開本無一二瓶斷根之藥，「克淋儂」在急性時約服四五瓶，慢性時約八九瓶，即見根治之功）無　胃及任何刺激，但　服時勿輕信他人之欺蒙，本藥主治男子急性尿道淋，慢性　　腺炎，睾丸炎，以及女子各種淋　帶下，可　用「卡氏陰道片」。兩性之關節炎症，以此其治療應用範圍，更見擴大矣。食慾不振　　胃機能衰減，則見食慾不振，胸膈苦滿，見食輒厭等，此為夏日恒有之現　，患者多致延為慢性病，食思缺乏，胃納減少，遂發生種種頑固性之胃病，如胃擴張，神經性消化不良，胃潰　等，此為吾人所應注意之事，常見一般人以為夏日食慾不振，為　夏之症候，不予施治，致使體重日削，顔面蒼白，耗傷體力，影響此後之健康，亦何弗思之甚？　　對於前述症状，「強胃精」皆能治之。　　本藥又能行正腸蠕動之緩慢或過速，輔導消化，排除腸內之酸酵物，故善療急慢性腸炎，腹痛　瀉，甚至下痢日二三十回，大便　　，閉結不通，痔血，服「強胃精」當可治愈。因含有蛋黃素，為烟民便秘及戒烟妙品。　　「強胃精」為含有酵　，　，鈣，鐵等補分之複方製劑，於增進消化力之外，又能供榮養之補給。所以一般虛弱，及重症恢復期，營養不良貧血之人服之，卓著效騐。依其中酵　所食維他命B之效力，能治因缺少維他命B而來之腳氣症。以前許多胃劑，除僅能治胃疾之外，尤無兼療腸疾患等功效，今「強胃精」含多榮養鹽，故得舉食慾亢進，榮養增加之實效。鄧源和醫師肺病瑣談　　診所寗波路四川路口　診時下午四時至六時　　肺癆究竟有無特效藥　　自古霍氏發見肺癆病原之結合菌後，對于肺病之施治，遂有更進一步之辦法。不過癆菌體外包有一種抗酸性之蠟質，能抵抗任何藥力，故療法方面，除于適應症状可行手術外；藥治方面，多不過增進體內之營養，以幫助自然療能之抵禦而已。觀於近世肺劑中，大部分皆偏重此類治效，如增進食慾也，壯健神經也，旺盛血液也，所謂治標之法，但圖一時之效而已，欲求根治　乎其難矣。今「補肺拿爾」則不然，蓋其功力乃直接作用于肺部者也。其功效有滅除癆菌之蠟質，及減弱肺組織之酸素，使癆菌無法脫除藥力之侵襲，終之陷于死亡，於是則癆病可　矣，但本藥必須連服數瓶以上，因肺病與其他疾病不同，不可躁急求功。本藥性質和平，可大胆應用。　　一八三〇年Sommerbrodt氏應用　油之Kreosot於諸呼吸器疾患，如慢性氣管枝加答兒症，喀漱哮喘等，雅有殊效，但因其有毒性，後遂加以提製，而配合入「補肺拿爾」之中，故本劑善療哮喘，久咳頑痰，小兒百日咳，傷風，一經施用，效力即著。　　肺病患者之喀血咯痰，咳　胸痛，食減胃呆，潮熱盜汗，身體因瘦等，最好于服本劑外，同時並分別服用男用「補體康」，「補女容」，以旺盛體力，二者能治肺病人之腦弱眩暈，失眠心悸。前者並能治男子之遺精腎虧，後者並能調經補血，雙方並治，無有不霍然而廖者。隱病自療  金月仁醫師　　婦女有所謂隱病者，則指一般難以告人之疾患也，而白帶病亦屬其一，考此病之成因，有由卵巢發育不全，身體虛弱而來者，有因機械刺　，破裂局部粘膜，而致發炎者，有因不潔之接觸而來者，總之其原因甚多，而危險亦甚大。患者，下部恒覺不適，惡液涓流，局部腐爛，妨害小便，尿道刺痛，小腹膨脹。往往誘發月經困難，而成不孕之主因。是每個患有此病者，勿以其常見而忽之。　　一般醫家對於白帶一症，亦會費甚多時間之研究，但終未達到根除之目的。惟卡而雪地氏所發明之「卡而雪地氏陰道片」一藥，對於一切之白帶，不論遠年新起，均卓有良效。因此片有殺菌防腐之功，且毫無任何之副作用，每個患者，皆可在家秘密自療，每晚於臨睡前取一片納入　道深部。次晨洗去，即可　事。自可漸將白帶排除。惟因發育不全與體虛者，可兼服「補女容」因淋病傳染者，可兼服「克淋儂」，依此服用，功效更著。治淋藥之新貢獻  姚菊嚴醫師　　　　　不　之淋菌，必須予以徹底之殲滅若於初起時，不積極治療，往往本竄於組織繁雜之部分。若患者，一再失治，則此分散局部組織之淋菌，作更作一步之侵襲，於是變症百出，收拾為難矣。歐美各國醫家，從前不過僅行局部之殺菌與消炎，而不顧及善於　走之淋菌，故此愈彼起。終不能獲到斷根之目的。且反因此使淋菌擴地盤，益難處理也。　　惟淋病學大師彼得氏，獨具　眼，知欲根治淋病，非行掃除全部之淋菌不可。遂　其畢生心力，研究不　，終於最後發明「克淋儂」一藥，凡各期淋病服此藥後，能振奮全身之血中抗毒素與　菌，以徹底發揮其圍剿各部淋菌之作用。使無遺類。歐美各大醫家，無不交口譽為近代淋病治療學上之新貢獻。自有此藥發明後，一切局部之透膜殺菌等之粗陋濫造色素製劑，皆被打倒之例。不論新起之淋病如龜頭包皮紅腫，尿道刺痛灼熱，膿血交流之急性症。及續發症，倂發症之睾丸炎，後部尿道炎，攝護腺炎，輸精管炎，精囊炎等之慢性淋。及女性由不潔之接觸而來之陰道淋，陰門淋，子宮淋，淋毒性白帶等，均無不於最短期間，完成其徹底根治之責。惟女性如覺有陰道有不潔分泌液時，可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」以滌除白帶。友有內外兼顧，相得益彰之妙。戴德醫師內分泌講話　　診所　寗波路通和銀行對面　　發育不全之適當療治　　不論男女兩性，假如一個人發育覺得不能健全，此人必須注意內分泌機能是否失常，如已知共有此病態，即須從速設法救治，醫治此等青年發育不全之惟一治療，即現在所謂之臟器療法是矣。　　查發育不全之原因，除由先天者外，大多後天之　施手淫，卑婚，房事過度，以致斷喪性腺之發育機能，其他各臟之內分泌機能亦蒙其害。所以有下體矮小，艷夢頻發，而成遺洩，滑精，早漏，出此等症而來者，更有精衰萎頓，心跳失眠，腰痛腳弱，頭目眩暈健忘等。女子則月經不調，萎黃病，乳臀均欠發育。而成早衰不孕之症。　　關於此症之適當處置，宜服梅倫氏發明之男用「補體康」，女用「補女容」，自不難將上項發育不全之症状，迅獲治痊。因「補體康」與「補女容」二藥，係壯健之動物睾丸與卵巢荷爾蒙所製成，能改造生殖系之組織，而促其發育。及矯正病態。並能使肌肉充實，皮膚細膩，喚回固年之青春。但如患劇烈之遺精與漏精等。可同時進服「育精片」，以強固其輸精管，則獲效更速矣。「克淋儂」公開騐狀　　用情太濫　　李參化君，少年倜儻，自詡風流，惜用情太濫，涉足平康，竟致染得淋病，自　體力強壯，不予治療，遷延數載，淋濁時有時無，若遇過劇勞動，則濁流如注，莖中平日如虫行蟻　，或則疼痛不堪，睾丸腫大，行路拘痛不便，迭投各藥，毫無寸騐，經姚菊嚴醫師行血清及消息子檢查，斷為淋毒性睾丸炎，乃服「克淋儂」約三星期，淋濁即止，又繼服四瓶，同時並服「補體康」溫散睾腫，而補體弱，為期月許，即告全部根治，今立君考入某公司任職，凡以前之行為，已概行悔改，聞秋後即將舉行婚禮云。　　封建思想　　王和美夫人，于歸後因夫婦感情不睦，致力勃　時間，其夫乃作冶遊，後遂將淋毒，傳染于其夫人，致患白帶症，下部糜爛，陰中刺痛，月經不調，少腹膨脹，形神日憊，健美喪失無餘，眼圈燻黑，精神倦怠，其翁姑因頭腦腐舊，堅欲其子納妾，乃山鄰人示以「克淋儂」一藥與王夫人，即照購服用，以除淋毒，收效甚佳，旋又外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」每晚納一二片入陰道內，治其白帶，內外兼治，約五星期而廖，遂又續服「補女容」二瓶，以調經補血，身體果臻壯健，夫婦漸歸好合，不久即已受孕云。　　痛楚不堪　　林大文君，前因應友人之宴，酒後又入某舞塲，結識一舞娘，未幾即發生愛情，豈知對方為不潔之異性，因而　淋毒，尿道刺痛灼熱，妨害小便，膿液交流，龜頭赤腫，包皮翻轉，痛楚不堪，嗣經友人介紹至戴德醫師處治療，認為急性淋之極期症，隨囑服克淋特效藥「克淋儂」，以消炎鎮痛退腫，未三星期，果炎消腫退，所患全愈，檢查數次，並無淋毒反應。　　體弱染淋　　趙天風君，體弱多病，旋又染淋病，體益不支，遺精與淋病交作，迭治未愈。幸由陳少華醫師指示服「克淋儂」以搜清內部淋菌，同時服「補體康」以強壯身體，而止遺精。且亦可助淋之效也。連服四五星期後，即告根治。且體亦強健逾恒云。遺精之水治法  戴德醫師　　患遺精病者，其病因多得諸手淫，致性神經衰弱，輸精管及精　馳張，稍一興奮，遺精即來，睡眠中頻發艷夢，日久則體力衰憊，精神沉　，心悸亢進，背部疼痛，全身榮養減衰，每陷入生殖不能，甚至因遺精引起麻　而死　　本病可行水治法，背部與陰部行冷水灌溉，或冷水坐浴，如陰萎則可用冷水數杯，日灌溉四五次左右。　　藥物方面，宜攝取鎮靜神經之品，耐氏「育精片」具有鎮靜射精中樞之效，為治夢精，精漏，早期射精，並因遺精而來之專劑。且能增強意志及判斷力，犯有自　者，可獲戒除。永安公司有售。讀者如有疑難各症，請詳示地址，並附足回信郵票，直寄上海武定路八六九號康健醫藥編輯社收，當即照答。姚菊巖醫師淋病講座　　診所：四川路寗波路轉角　診時：上午十時至下午六時　　成慢性淋之注意與醫治　　在病體之原則上說，一般急性淋確慢性淋為易治，不過慢性淋之成為不易治，多由於患者忽視自身嚴重之疾患。慢性淋之為一般人所忽視者，由於外症無若何表現，而痛苦亦不若急性時之劇烈。雖偶爾再發，仍不以為意。如此愈發愈劇，終致變生不測，矛生命上以威脅。大概淋毒入慢性期後，淋菌亦深入潛伏之淋菌，乘機　發，續發諸症，因而紛然並起。如要丸炎，攝護腺炎等，多起於淋病慢性以後者。　　凡在經患淋病者，理宜行多次之檢查，此種檢查，并其一次即可證明，往往檢查至十餘次而始發見淋菌者。故非有經驗豐富之醫治療不可。但又有患者本身雖告根治，不知妻子亦早染此毒，而忽略之故有重覆傳染之事。關於慢性淋之適當療法。宜用抗淋血清，及X線與電療，一方投以克淋儂，使其體內發生一種抗淋免毒作用，以殲滅淋菌，而收消炎鎮痛利尿之功效。便深部淋菌亦可一掃而除，可免重發之患。同時如妻子已染有淋毒性自帶者，則除行內服克淋儂外，更宜外用卡而　地陰道片為坐藥，以滌除白帶，即可獲得全愈之騐矣！</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言關於草棚  方克文　　靠了二千餘人的以馬桶掃帚等為武器而抵抗，以及奔走呼籲，滬東區的棚戶已經得了小小的勝利，准予展緩拆遷了。這勝利是暫時的，在展緩拆遷的期限過了時，在「整飭市容」的名目下，那些可憐的棚戶是依舊得遭受悲劇的命運的。　　為了挽救這悲劇的命運，並且是鑒於唇亡齒寒起見，滬東泥西的棚戶是組織了一個棚戶聯合會，在聯席會議上，主席提出了如下的意見：（一）從速建築平民住宅，使棚棚有安居之所：（二）提高勞工報酬，籌設平民工廠：（三）從寬車夫登記：（四）棚戶自動組織聯合會，作有系統之管理：（五）限止增加棚：（六）自動辦理戶口調查：（七）實行保甲自治，每十戶為一組。這七項意見中，如果第一項能實現，並且棚戶有經濟能力可以住，則（四）（五）（六）（七）項都可以廢除（二）而（三）兩項，除第三項還有可能，第二項未免是太著的理想，在目前，棚戶們是在三日工或竟是失業的狀况過着生活的，他們只要有工作，那裏還敢想「提高勞工報酬」，至於籌設平民工廠，則在目下原有各廠都相繼陷於半停工的狀態中，平民工廠的能否成立，更是昭昭明甚的事情，不必我們多曉舌的。　　關於第一項的「從速建築平民住宅」，我們為了「市容」，為了棚戶們的「威生」着想，自然是亟望他能够「從速建築」的，然而，姑不論工部局當局建築平民住宅與吾，卽使建築了，棚戶們有沒有能力來住却還是一個問題，根據棚戶們第一次向市民聯合會呼籲的信，其中說：「因為市面不景氣，經濟緊縮，工業凋零，……因為少壯的人，一個月做半個月工作，平均每天四角錢，一個月靠六塊錢，如是一個人，尙可混嘴，否則那家沒有老幼袛祗好拿這點薪工去買荳渣和碎米，煮那黃菜皮……呌我們拆去，來住樓房，恐怕萬難辦到，因為我們三日班之代價，不敷房租支出……」從這裏，棚戶們是否住得起「平民住宅」，是不難看出來的：雖然棚戶聯合會的議决案上，也有「要求工部局從速建築平民住宅，以免棚戶流離失所」這一條，但如果房租不是免費便是定得極低，棚戶們的「流離失所」恐怕還是難免的。　　其次是「限止增加棚戶」，自然，如果市面轉好，限止增加棚戶是不難辦到的，豈僅限止增加，就卽使「限令拆遷」都不成問題，人如果能够有能力生活得好些，試問誰還願住那污穢陰暗的草棚，然而，在現社會組職下，市面轉好的希望旣那麼渺茫，幾乎是成為一個幻想，而在內憂外患，天災人禍下，在農村的人民旣給趕到都市來，而都市中的勞工們又被捲入失業的狂潮，在帝國主義的各種侵略下，决殖民地的中國旣形成了總崩潰的形勢，試問誰能「限止」得了棚戶「不增加」！　　草棚問題是社會問題的一環，如果整個社會問題無法解决，那麼，它是不會有解决的辦法的。趕塲  林豪　　這一間狹小的，灰黯的屋子裏，充積着窒息的氣鬱：從那黏滿了塵粒的窗子，淡淡地透進一絲無力的光亮。公鷄猛可地嘶啼起來，隨着，喔喔喔的聲息不時驚鬧着這一個小小的村落，什麼都像流露着活躍的生氣。屋裏的光綫暗，厚發家的滿臉皺紋底容貌便更為難看了。眉兒差不離愁的碰頭，細味地咀嚼這個苦臉，不懷疑，誰都認她孕育着很多的悒憂！在她的心田裏！她邊兒在灶頭上端了盌筷菜粥等類的東西，走近厚發坐着的桌沿，邊兒便嘮嘮叨叨地埋怨她的丈夫說：　　「我說，你還是不去的妙？兵慌馬亂的，一下子便拉去了：你想，呌咱們母子倆怎麼得了。毛毛兒爹，我眞怕你去！」　　「媽民，坤道家僅得卵事！」厚發雙手接住了粥菜，白白眼：「人家公事人都說：新來的這一批灰葉兒，是不拉夫的：昨兒咱回來，街上碰到胡四團正，咱問他，他說儘趕你們的塲子，沒有的事：打更的老麻也鳴過了鑼。（註：鳴鑼意義便是呌村人們不要驚慌的表示。）而且……」媽……」說到這兒便頓住着，低下頭，自管自將筷子沙沙沙地劃着粥。厚發家的祗有獃獃地望着他出神。　　坐在厚發對面的宅毛，張若雙圓圓的眼珠，拖着鼻涕，期期艾艾地指手劃脚着說：「爹爹，你趕塲去？又得挑李子去賣啦！回來的當兒得給我呢？紅紅的，紅紅的鷄血李。」接着，回過頭來又向媽說：「媽！你幹麼不讓爹去？爹賺錢，咱們有飯吃，更有李子哩！嘻嘻。」媽突地敲了他一掌：「小猴子精，你懂得？」　　厚發草草地吃過了粥，放下盌筷，隨意抹了抹嘴。桌上拿起旱烟管和烟荷包，裏好一袋烟，栽進斗子，到灶脚下去燃火吸：順手在牆角裏提起兩支籮筐，又在門背後找着扁擔，出門去了。厚發家的急匆匆地趕到門外：「依我說……」　　「依你說不去！媽民，錢會生起翅膀飛到懷裏來？」兇狠狠地白了他妻子一眼，吐了口唾沫，一面已把籮筐掛在扁擔尖上，一下　上了肩，然後把旱烟管望嘴裏咬着。虎虎地吸得怪有勁的，一撒脚便向阿貴的家裏走。毛毛喜歡地跟了幾步又回去。　　「喂！阿貴，快走囉！」厚發在阿貴當門的田塍上喊。沒有阿貴的影兒，阿貴嫂却伸長了脖子打門裏攢出來：「他早去了啦！」　　厚發突自茫然裏攢出個大悟，明白阿貴昨兒的自已一路趕塲原是騙人的，他自家早就走了：這龜子東西的，他是想去搶早市口，忽地，又想起長根，富春，阿昌，金水，塘灣兒的弟兄們差不離都去趕市：人一多，那就糟糕，市口一步步地漲，交易就難做；邊想邊就加緊了脚步，眞想生了翅膀一飛便到。　　這裏厚發家的盼候到太陽落坡，還不見厚發來家，心頭的小鹿忐忑地跳個不停，携着毛毛，反餓了門，一拐到了阿貴的家，恰好阿貴嫂打裏面走出，迎面便打開話匣來：「阿貴嫂，你家阿費回家了沒有？唉！眞是，定會凶多吉少的，我早就勸他去不得，他祗一味稱着沒危險，惡嘴惡相的鬧着去得：說什麼打更的老麻鳴過鑼咧：胡四團正也說去得咧，絲毫沒些兒遲疑，你瞧：天色眞不早啦！還不曾見個影踪。老天囉！做啥子孽哩？」　　「魂靈才回來呢！活該老百姓遭殃，又鬧什麼民戰！」　　這時，街子上零零星星地二三個，三五個，一堆堆聚着像說新聞。一忽兒便聚成個三五十個坤道家的大集團，於是，言論紛紛地活像早晨的按家刷馬子的聲浪，煩紊地響作着，間或有幾聲高而且尖的喉音，這些是鷄羣之鶴的嗓子，聽來更覺得有些動人。那位長根家的便是一隻顯著的鶴：「在我的眼珠裏瞧，不是說句倒霉的話，怕是早給拉去了嘍！」　　活像囚犯到了受死刑當兒的那個模樣，大家扮着個不知所云的苦臉，你　是她，她瞧着那，靜靜的，默聲了一會。然而，她們的心頭裏是有着同樣的恐怖，同樣的焦急，同樣的忿惱，以及同樣的疑慮。但，那個素來有名的長舌婦的金水嫂，她却打破了這霎時的沉靜說：「咱們再走塘灣兒那邊去看他們回來了沒有。死站在這兒中什麼用？這事情看來是准給拉去了。」　　一窩蜂似的又趕到那兒，伸長了腦袋，一眼不霎地注視着。　　「有人來哩！」不知什麼亮眼的人，快樂得近乎跳起來地說。　　近百的眼珠睜得怪圓的。瞧：—不錯，有個人，飛也似的奔來。（希望是他。）厚發家的默默地祈求着。　　等到那個人近來的時侯，阿昌爹突地跑去，擁着那個說：　　「怎麼了，這樣急忽的？」　　「他…們們…全給拉…拉…去啦！」阿昌氣呼呼地說：「我算…是運…氣，給我，…溜走…咧…」　　老人的臉顯着無限的安慰：自己的孩子幸得無恙。　　可是，一顆炸彈那麼地炸毀了大夥兒的心。　　「天啦！」　　「我喊他去不得！」厚發家的抺把子鼻涕，哭了。　　「沒天良的咧！」　　「哇……毛毛張開了嘴也哭。　　天黑黯了。這村落還飛騰着號哭，和咀罵的音流。</p>

<p>(Jiujiang) According to a phone call from Guling, Qian Dajun flew to Guangdong on the morning of the 22nd to represent the military authorities in negotiating the reorganization of Guangdong's military affairs. He is expected to stay for a few days before returning to Guling. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Yu Hanmou was unable to go to the province on the 22nd due to business, and specially telegraphed He Sheng and others to act accordingly. The telegram said, "Restrict immediate arrival. To Chief of Staff He Gongzhuo in Guangzhou and Commander of the Military Police Li Shuzong, brothers, I am unable to leave for the province today due to urgent matters that need to be dealt with. Please also inform Zicai, as desired. Yu Hanmou, seal." (22nd Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The headquarters of the First Group Army will be reorganized into the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army on the 24th. The military police guarding the headquarters were withdrawn on the 22nd and replaced by troops from the First Army. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Yu Hanmou is expected to enter the province today. His troops were transported by train from Shaozhou into the provincial capital last night. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Chen Jitang left Guangdong, the generals in Guangdong have unanimously supported the central government and sent representatives to welcome Yu Hanmou to the province to preside over affairs. Yu's troops have already entered the province from Shaozhou. The Fourth Route Army headquarters telegraphed from Beijing on the evening of the 21st, stating that Yu is scheduled to depart from Shaozhou on the 22nd and will arrive on the same day. It is reported that Yu will convene a meeting of generals in the province to convey the intentions of the central government and discuss the aftermath. Zhang Jian, the president of the Guangdong Military Medical School, who was sent by Yu to Beijing some time ago, has been in contact with various parties in Beijing and has completed the takeover of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters' office in Beijing. He took a train to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 22nd to wait for a ship to return to Guangdong to report on his mission. The Beijing office has been largely taken over and has begun operations, with Li Kangxi temporarily acting as director. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Yu Hanmou, who was originally scheduled to enter Guangzhou today, has postponed his departure. According to Chinese sources, a portion of the guard army, previously led by Chen Jitang's brother Chen Weizhou, has become unstable. Yu has ordered the local garrison to suppress it.

It is reported that they have declared their opposition to the new Guangdong provincial authorities, but their actions are still unknown. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Mo Huanzhang will enter Beijing within days to discuss the matter with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Huang Xuchu is currently in Guling to discuss solutions to the Guangxi problem with Chiang Kai-shek. The rumors that the Guangxi Army has entered Guangdong Province are not true. They are currently still concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of Guangxi Province. At the same time, according to Chinese sources here, the Nanjing government is now insisting that Li and Bai should first step down before the peaceful resolution of the Southwest issue can be discussed. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Hopes to Go Abroad for Observation; The Central Government Has Not Yet Considered This</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that after Chen Jitang stepped down, the central government, considering that Chen, although he had relinquished military power, was still a member of the National Defense Council, hoped that Chen would come to Beijing to discuss national affairs. However, Chen hopes to be given a title to go abroad for observation, which the central government has not yet considered. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong natives Zhang Shanpei and others telegraphed the central government on the 21st, stating that Chen Jitang had been entrenched in Guangdong for seven years and had colluded with Qu Fangpu, Lin Yizhong, Chen Weizhou, and others to issue tens of millions of yuan in various public bonds in the name of national defense autonomy, with unclear revenues and expenditures. They requested that Chen and others be arrested and brought to justice to account for their actions. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Two Southwest Agencies Completed Their Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The headquarters' executive committee concluded its work on the 22nd. The documents are awaiting instructions from the central government for handover. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Air Force Personnel Return to the Province from Hong Kong to Serve</h3>

<h3>Chen Ce Leads Warships to Guangdong</h3>

<h3>The Judicial Yuan Reorganizes the Judiciary of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At its regular meeting on the 21st, the Judicial Yuan resolved to abolish the Southwest Supreme Court Branch. On the same day, it telegraphed the Guangdong and Guangxi High Courts, stating that henceforth, in addition to cases that should be appealed to the two high courts, cases for the third instance shall be transferred to the Supreme Court for trial in accordance with the law. The Ministry of Justice believes that the new three-level, three-instance system has been delayed in implementation in Guangdong and Guangxi due to special circumstances, which is regrettable. The ministry specifically ordered the Guangdong High Court to implement the new system as soon as possible, starting in October. The judicial paper used in the province has always been printed and issued arbitrarily and is not subject to control, which is also inappropriate. In the future, the paper issued by the ministry should be used. The qualifications of judicial personnel in the province will also be assessed to ensure that the judiciary of the two provinces will be reorganized so that the national judiciary will be unified. In addition, the newly appointed acting President of the Guangdong High Court, Ye Xiasheng, paid a visit to Minister Wang on the morning of the 22nd to ask for instructions on everything and will soon leave for his new post.

<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Baoding, the Yellow River in Hebei rose by 3 centimeters on the morning of the 20th due to the influx of water from Shaanxi, with a water level of 58.73 meters. The old dam's backflow is eroding. All sweeps below No. 47 are under great stress. The strong current moved north at Shenshi (3-5 PM), and all small dikes and sweeps north of the Fourth Dike were in danger. The River Bureau is supervising emergency repairs. Wang Jingru, the director of the Hebei Construction Department, went to inspect various dangerous projects. Representatives from Changyuan County pleaded for the reinforcement of the Daxing Dike. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The South Canal Bureau received a telegram from the first and second sections on the 22nd, stating that the water level had slightly decreased by the evening. Flood control materials have been piled up along various sections of the river in preparation for emergency repairs. The water level at Shuzhen is 17.47 meters, and at Bozhen, it is 15.87 meters.

<h3>Zou Lin, Song ZiLiang, and Others Arrive in Guangdong; Discussed Matters with Yu Hanmou While Passing Through Shaozhou; Issued Statements on the Reorganization of Guangdong's Finances</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Lin, the head of the Ministry of Finance, Song Ziliang, the newly appointed Director of Finance of Guangdong Province, and their entourage flew from Shanghai to Guangdong on China Aviation Corporation's Mail Plane Nanjing at 8:05 AM on the 22nd, arriving in Shaozhou at 12:00 PM. They visited Yu Hanmou to discuss matters and had lunch before continuing their flight, arriving at the air force airport at 3:00 PM. They were welcomed by Hu Jinya, Tang Haian, He Pengzhou, the secretary of the Finance Department, Zheng Tieru, the manager of the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China, Li Luchao, a member of the provincial government, and dozens of others. The authorities dispatched the Anti-Smuggling General Office of the Finance Department and military police for protection. They stayed at the hotel, and a tea party was held by various circles to welcome them at 4:00 PM. Zou delivered a speech, followed by a welcome speech by Fan Zhanpeng, the deputy director of the Provincial Anti-Smuggling General Office. Then, Director Song delivered a speech, stating that Guangdong Province has made the greatest contribution to the country, and he hoped that everyone would work together to restore its former glory. It is reported that Song is scheduled to take office within days. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Jue, the head of the Ministry of Finance, and Song, the newly appointed Special Commissioner of Finance for Guangdong and Acting Director of Finance, arrived in Guangdong by plane on the 22nd. Reporters went to visit them and inquired about their opinions on the reorganization of Guangdong's finances. Zou and Song, feeling tired from their journey, did not meet with reporters, but only sent Hao Chongguang to deliver the following written statement to the Central News Agency reporter: "Guangdong is the source of the revolution and an important coastal port. The development of foreign trade occupies a considerable position internationally. Therefore, the central government attaches more importance to Guangdong Province than any other place. For many years, there has been no opportunity to seek overall reorganization. The government authorities feel guilty about this. Now that the situation in Guangdong has been settled and the haze has dissipated, everyone knows that without unified government orders, there is no way to save the country and preserve its existence. This is the government's long-standing desire to seek welfare for the people of Guangdong and work together, which can now be expected to be realized. Finance and banking are crucial to the lifeline, and reorganization cannot be delayed. Minister Kong, due to heavy departmental affairs, specially sent Lin as a representative to Guangdong to inspect. At the same time, in accordance with the decision of the Executive Yuan, Ziliang was appointed as the Special Commissioner of Finance for Guangdong. Minister Kong is extremely anxious that the situation in Guangdong has just been settled and people's hearts are unsettled, and important positions cannot be left vacant and important government affairs cannot be suspended. Therefore, he changed to take a plane and arrived in Guangdong. First of all, he will conduct a detailed and accurate investigation of how to formulate an overall plan for financial and monetary affairs and thoroughly reorganize them, and submit various plans to the central or local government for approval and gradual implementation, with the overall goal of benefiting both the national economy and the people's livelihood and living up to the expectations of the people of the country." (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zou Lin and Song Ziliang got off the plane to visit Yu Hanmou while passing through Shaozhou. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Tang Haian, the newly appointed Salt Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, told a Reuters reporter today that the Ministry of Finance will reorganize Guangdong's finances to the best of its ability, even if it suffers significant losses. Tang is currently temporarily managing Guangdong's finances pending the arrival of Song Ziliang, the newly appointed Director of Finance of Guangdong Province. According to Tang's estimate, the central government will use at least 50 million yuan to put everything on a solid foundation, because Guangdong Province has no sufficient reserve fund and has arbitrarily issued banknotes. Tang also said that there is a total of 100 million yuan in silver in Guangzhou, which fortunately has not been used. At present, the central government has no intention of transporting silver to Nanjing or selling part of it. This matter will be entirely controlled by the Banknote Issuance Supervisory Committee. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Legal Tender Association decided to establish a Guangdong branch, with Zou Minchu as chairman. Zou was also appointed as the manager of the Guangdong branch of the Central Bank. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) After arriving in Guangdong, Song Ziliang and Zou Lin spoke with reporters who visited them, saying that the government has resolved to thoroughly reorganize Guangdong's finances, but they intend to first conduct a detailed investigation and draft a plan to present to the government. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Guangdong Province has always been a crucial position in the central government's finances. The central government's tax revenue in the province was more than 44 million yuan in the 21st year. In the 22nd year, considering only the reported customs and salt taxes, it has reached more than 35 million yuan. The details of other consolidated taxes, mineral production taxes, stamp taxes, and tobacco and alcohol taxes are unknown because they have not been reported. According to sources familiar with the financial circles, the various central tax revenues in the province in recent years are at least around 50 million yuan. If thoroughly reorganized in the future, it will be of considerable benefit to the national treasury. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The London Times Comments on the Chinese Situation</h3>
<p>(London) Today's Times published an editorial discussing the collapse of the Southwest disturbances in China, stating in general terms: "Now that the focus of the situation has become a thing of the past, it is not a time for celebration, but the reflection of this situation is not only for the benefit of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but also for the benefit of the entire China. Japan is adept at twisting any effective action by China, so the result, in addition to further strengthening the central government's hand, will be a general stimulant for the political thought of all levels of people in China. Since the extremist movement has been ineffective, we should celebrate China's progress," etc. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Currency Recovers Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong dollar has rebounded. On the 22nd, each dollar was worth 6 jiao and 5 fen in Guangdong currency. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Closing of the Meeting of Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>The joint meeting of chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities has now concluded. The current meeting is nearly a decade from the last. In these years, the situation of industry and commerce has become more difficult and the encounters more severe. Externally, economic aggression presses hard. Internally, rural revival seems infinitely far off. Though this is an overall economic problem, which cannot be effectively resolved by local solutions, one should not succumb to others merely because the difficulties and dangers are great. Therefore, the holding of the current joint meeting of representatives of chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities is indeed a manifestation of the self-awareness of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The meeting lasted three days. Though the period was short, the resolutions discussed, such as inspecting smuggled goods, the long-unresolved issue of the liability for repayment of partnership debts, and the abolition of disguised likin and postponement of income tax, all have a direct bearing on industry and commerce. Following these paths, though it may not be possible to revitalize industry and commerce in a positive sense, in a negative sense the protection can also maintain industry and commerce from collapsing. For rest and recuperation are indeed the way to revive the declining and revitalize the abandoned. Herewith, we will select the main points of the resolutions for discussion.</p>
<p>Though Shanghai is the first line of defense for the nation's commerce, it is difficult to fortify the front line if the rear is weak. Today's smuggling all targets the rear. The rear should have a strict organization so that the front may be free from worries about the rear. Since the chambers of commerce are representative organizations of industry and commerce in various places, the prevention of smuggling relies precisely on the automatic action of industry and commerce in various places. If they do not transport or sell them and strictly inspect and deal with them fairly, smuggled goods will be eliminated without being intercepted. Therefore, whether smuggling can be stopped in the future will depend on the strength of the anti-smuggling committees established this time in various places.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that industry and commerce have been exhausted in recent years. The abolition of harsh levies and the elimination of likin are measures to revive them. However, due to the financial difficulties of local governments, the so-called "disguised likin" is still difficult to completely abolish, and the promulgation of new taxes imposes an even heavier burden. Taxes come from the people. The reason for the current financial difficulties is precisely because the people are poor and merchants are distressed. Inland commerce is far inferior to the past due to the bankruptcy of the countryside, frequent droughts and floods, and the result of banditry. The people have no purchasing power, goods are accumulated and immobile, and funds are concentrated in the cities. The turnover is difficult, and the market is even more desolate. The business tax, special tax, and house tax are all burdensome compared to their current ability. Moreover, now that income tax is levied in addition to business tax, though income is taken from profits and is not comparable to those who must bear it regardless of profit or loss, even if there is a surplus in one year, it all comes from saving on expenses. A slight expansion is bound to be unsustainable. In addition, the accounting organization of inland stores is crude and simple, and there is no telling what disputes will arise in the future from uncovering concealment and auditing net profits.</p>
<p>The issue of liability for partnership operations has been debated for a long time. From a legal point of view, it is fair that each partner should be jointly responsible for the amount by which the partnership assets are insufficient to pay off the partnership debts. In fact, the liability of shareholders in limited liability companies is limited to their invested capital. Before the company business is developed, partnership operations still account for the majority of business organizations. It is impossible to force them all to reorganize uniformly. The original intention of the legislation was to protect the interests of creditors, but the opposite often happens. Because of the need for joint responsibility, the more wealthy partners are unwilling to contribute their due share of capital, waiting for the situation to change. As a result, lawsuits drag on for years, and people run around mediating. The creditors' gains may not be enough to compensate for their losses. If the amount of the shortfall is allowed to be apportioned according to shares to complete their responsibility, those who care about their reputation will all be happy to pay. For those who do not pay, strict sanctions should be set, and creditors should also be able to seek legal remedies for relief. Moreover, because of the great responsibility borne by partners, the more wealthy partners regard engaging in industry and commerce as a dangerous prospect, and deposit all their funds abroad. Inland finance is becoming more and more depleted. If the responsibility for partnership repayment can be slightly reduced, then the investment in industry and commerce will not be as hesitant as before.</p>
<p>However, all this is not a problem for the chambers of commerce themselves. I believe that what the chambers of commerce in various places should pay the most attention to today is how to develop their spirit. Is the purpose of the chambers of commerce not to seek the development of industry, commerce, and foreign trade? At a time when trade is in deficit and there is no way out, export commodities remain the same as before, foreign forces are encroaching deeper and deeper, handicrafts have failed and are on the verge of exhaustion, and new industries have no way to take their place, the laxity of the industrial and commercial sectors is still as old as ever, and the dispersion of the spirit is still like that of the elderly. But ordinary merchants still regard the group as a tool to deal with government offices. As for the improvement of business and the creation of enterprises, they often close their doors and refuse to join the forces of the group and are unwilling to have it interfere. Therefore, not only has foreign trade not benefited from development, but how can there be any development of the industrial and commercial sectors themselves? Therefore, whether the healthy development of industry and commerce is possible in the future, the key lies in whether the organization of industrial and commercial groups can be sound.</p>

<h3>Japan Decides to Invest in Developing the Economy of North China</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Ishii, a senior staff officer of the Japanese Garrison in North China, stated that the safety of North China is related to Japan's national defense. Japan does not want this area to become a "desert" and be greatly affected. Therefore, it has decided to invest in developing the economy to stabilize the lives of North China's farmers, revitalize the rural areas, and promote market prosperity so that Japanese goods can be sold. This is a necessary measure for Japan; otherwise, Japan fears that the rural areas of North China will decline daily, and security and economy will be shaken, affecting Japan's national defense policy. He dared to declare that Japan has absolutely no intention of making North China a "Manchukuo" the second. The treasures and underground resources within Shanxi Province, coupled with the poverty of the people and the exhaustion of wealth, would also benefit the province if Japan were to invest. The construction of the Cangshi Railway and the economy of Hebei Province are also of great importance. The military is pursuing this plan and is seriously monitoring Japanese investors who engage in deceptive practices. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Smuggled Hankou Goods to Disappear; Instructions Sought on How to Handle Confiscated Goods; Legitimate Duty-Paid Japanese Goods Are Steadily Being Transported to Hankou</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Since the establishment of the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters, the smuggling routes southward have been cut off. The crackdown along the Peiping-Hankou Railway is particularly stringent. Starting from June 2nd, branch offices were established in Dazhimen, Xinyang, Zhumadian, Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Shijiazhuang, and Changxindian to intercept the southward smuggling route. Those without transportation and sales licenses were detained. As a result, a surprisingly large amount of confiscated smuggled sugar, bicycle parts, aniline dyes, and rayon has been seized. The Customs is currently seeking instructions from the headquarters on how to handle these items. The Anti-Smuggling Headquarters has also sent Deputy Director Li Shoupeng to Hankou to oversee everything. Currently, most Chinese merchants in Wuhan have realized that trafficking in smuggled goods is nothing but self-inflicted suffering. Due to the significant losses from mid-way confiscations, most have voluntarily stopped. With the reduction in the source of smuggled goods, the need for legitimate duty-paid Japanese goods in the market has become urgent. Recently, these goods have been transported to Hankou by Japanese ships. For example, Japanese ships on the Yangtze River had not imported sugar for three months, but recently, it has been arriving steadily. The "Luoyang Maru," which arrived in Hankou the other day, transported 4,000 bags of white sugar. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese authorities' anti-smuggling efforts are directly promoting the development of normal trade between China and Japan. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Paris) The situation in Spain remains unclear. Both the government and the rebel army claim victory. It is not easy for outsiders to know the truth. According to news from Madrid, the situation there is relatively peaceful. However, almost all the troops in the city have been transferred to the northern and southern fronts to confront the rebel army. According to news from Andaye (southern France), the border between France and Spain was quiet last night. According to the observations of French authorities in that city, the rebel army is likely to start negotiations with the government army first to persuade them to surrender. If negotiations fail, they will launch an attack. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The latest news from Spain received here states that the Spanish government has dispatched 150,000 troops to advance northward to prevent the rebel army from moving south. This army includes troops loyal to the government, militias, and youth leagues of socialists and communists. It is expected that this will be a decisive battle between the government and the rebel army. The report also stated that the rebel army will engage in battle in the area of the Somosierra Pass, which is the main mountain pass of the rebel army.</p>
<p>(Paris) Police along the French-Spanish border reported today that the rebel army led by General Mola had taken San Sebastian without a fight, occupying many villages along the way. It is claimed that Mr. Mola announced that as soon as he was certain that the north supported the rebel army, he would launch an attack on Madrid. Now, the time for a major battle seems imminent because members of the Popular Front in that area have begun to arm themselves to assist the government. (21st Nationalist Electric)</p>

All conscripts from the 1931 and 1936 classes must enlist today. The government views this move as a sign that the rebel army is running out of steam. (22nd Havas Dispatch) (Paris) According to various sources, the Spanish rebel army is gradually making significant progress. Refugees arriving at Hendaye on the French-Spanish border claim that the provinces of Zaragoza, Navarre, Caca, Vitoria, Burgos, Valladolid, and Pontevedra are all under rebel control. Border guards in Hendaye, Biarritz, and Danquieria have also sided with the rebel army. The rebel army has now occupied San Sebastian, but the radio station has not yet surrendered and is currently under siege by the rebel army. At the same time, according to news from Tangier, the rebel headquarters in Ceuta has warned neutral ships to leave the port because the rebel army plans to bomb government warships from the air. It is said that the ships are trapped in the port due to lack of fuel and food. However, one British warship remains in the port. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Authorities of Catalonia Issue a Warning to the Rebel Army, Urging Them to Withdraw from the City of Zaragoza, Otherwise They Will Dispatch the Air Force to Bomb</h3>

Lieutenant Colonel Sandino, the commander of the Air Force in this city, issued a warning to General Cabanellas, the leader of the rebel army in Zaragoza, by radio this morning, stating that if the regime in that city is not handed over to a civilian governor loyal to the government within a short period of time, a detachment of the Air Force will fly to the city to bomb the barracks. The situation in this city is still stable, and food supplies can still be maintained as usual. According to newspaper reports, all organizations that do not support the republican system have been ordered to be closed by the provincial government.

Colonel Sangfeliz, the former adjutant of General Barerra, the rebel staff officer, is also among them. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tangier Twelve Spanish warships are currently docked in this port. It is said that as soon as the "Jaime I" battleship arrives, it will bombard the rebel army in Ceuta. Rebel leader Franco requested today that the International Committee governing Tangier order the warships to withdraw or submit to the rebel army, otherwise rebel aircraft will bomb the warships. However, the position of the "Jaime I" is quite questionable. The ship has a displacement of 16,000 tons, a crew of 854, and is armed with eight 12-inch guns. Rebel leader General Mola announced by radio that the ship had arrived in Vigo and joined the rebel army. News from Vigo, on the other hand, stated that the ship's commander did intend to join the rebellion, but the soldiers refused and shot the commander. (21st Nationalist Electric)</p>

<h3>Tense Situation in the North; San Sebastian Falls into the Hands of the Rebel Army</h3>
<p>(London) According to news received from the French border, the town of San Sebastian in northern Spain has been occupied by the rebel army after fierce fighting. Twenty-four members of the local loyalist short-gun team were killed in the battle. Several British travelers drove several cars from there across the French border. It is believed that several British people are still stranded in the area. After the rebel army succeeded, it is said that it is now advancing southwest towards Bilbao, the capital of the province of Biscay. According to British travelers arriving at Hendaye on the French-Spanish border, San Sebastian was attacked by rebel aircraft from the sky with machine guns before it surrendered. At the same time, the rebel army's attempt to invade Madrid has failed. The government army fought the rebel army twice near the capital and defeated the rebel army. Those who participated in the battle included the assault police force, city guards, and Red Militia. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources have recently stated that the provinces of Navarre and Guipuzcoa in northern Spain, and most of the province of Andalusia in the south, are all in the hands of the rebel army. The rebel army is currently advancing on the capital, Madrid, in two directions, north and south. The northern army is led by General Mola, which includes the regular army originally stationed in the northern provinces, the militias of the cities of Burgos and Zaragoza, and members of the Traditionalist Communion party (also known as the "Carlist Party") of Pamplona (whose leader is Prince Carlos, who is 86 years old and opposes the restoration of King Alfonso XIII). The general's long-cherished wish is to move south, and claims to be only 50 kilometers away from the capital, Madrid. General Mola also told reporters that his actions are purely for the sake of national interest, and his goal is to liberate Spain from the scourge of Marxist factions, the Second and Third Internationals, and various secret societies. The southern army is led by General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the rebel army, whose troops are mostly the Seville city garrison, but it is reported that they have been surrounded by the government army of Malaga and Rijonté and the Mediterranean coast, so their position is quite dangerous.</p>
<p>The above is the situation of the rebel army in mainland Spain. As for the government side, it recently announced that the rebel army in Alcalá de Henares and Tetuán in the vicinity of the capital had been defeated by the government troops, suffering heavy casualties. Moroccan rebels landing at Algeciras (not far from the British port of Gibraltar) were also repelled by the government army.</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, the current situation in northern Spain is indeed extremely tense. A large number of officials in that area have crossed the border to France to take refuge, and have visited French officials. Among them are the governors of the three provinces of Navarre, Guipuzcoa, and Pamplona, and the leaders of the Popular Front in Irún, Irazki, etc., as well as more than 50 British expatriates, carrying their wives, children, and luggage, and traveling on trucks placed by the Popular Front to take refuge in France. It is now known that the rebel army led by General Mola encountered the government army in Entarraje near the French border and engaged in a fierce battle. The government army suffered 24 deaths and retreated in defeat. A bridge in Entarraje was destroyed to prevent the rebel army from advancing. The rebel army took a secluded path and went straight to the city of San Sebastian, and finally captured it at 5:10 PM and immediately took advantage of the victory to advance west and seize the port of Bilbao (on the coast of the Bay of Biscay). At the same time, Irún has also been surrounded by the rebel army, but according to news received in Bayonne (southern France), the San Sebastian radio station is still in the hands of the government army. It is also said that the northern industrial center of Bilbao was occupied by the rebel army at 10:30 PM tonight. In addition, a Colonel Villanubia led 400 "Carlists" from Pamplona along the Bidasoa River to Behobia. The garrison of Behobia, mostly communists, destroyed the bridge to prevent the rebel army from advancing. The rebel army has crossed the river and advanced to 10 kilometers from the city, waiting for reinforcements from the rear before attacking the troops inside the city. Trenches have been dug in the mountains near Irún and Behobia, winding and undulating, stretching endlessly, for defense. According to news received in Andaye (also in southern France), the provinces of Navarre, Guipuzcoa, Burgos, and Valladolid in northern Spain are now in the hands of the rebel army. Two policemen from the province of Pamplona recently escaped to Andaye across the border. According to them, when the rebel army entered San Sebastian, they witnessed the gendarmes in the city immediately surrendering and not resisting. A section of the border between France and Spain is now guarded by the rebel army. It is also rumored that a portion of the Barcelona city garrison in Spain mutinied. The local government has asked the capital for assistance. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Violent Street Fighting Erupts in Barcelona; 300 Dead, 3,000 Injured; Authorities Announce Martial Law</h3>

The local radio station issued a warning to the rebel commander in Zaragoza at 2:30 this morning, stating that if they do not immediately surrender to the government army, they will be bombed. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to a report from a Daily Telegraph correspondent, the Spanish rebel army has occupied Barcelona again. (21st Nationalist Electric)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the latest news received here, the Spanish rebel army occupied Barcelona this morning. It is said that civilians and policemen attached to the rebel army fought street battles with armed soldiers all day long. In the early morning, when the rebel army entered the city, they disbanded all the policemen and armed soldiers, but they could not find the Communist Party Executive Committee. The state news reported that the fall of Barcelona was welcomed by the people because the three days of terror had come to an end. The rebel army has a significant advantage in northern Spain, and it is reported that ten provinces are in their hands. (22nd Nationalist Electric)</p>
<h3>The Rebel Party's Uprising Plan; Simultaneous Attacks on the Borders Were Discovered in Advance; The Failure of the Militia to Rebel Was a Major Reason for the Divine Defeat</h3>
<p>Madrid The outbreak of this rebellion in Spain has become a prairie fire in just a few days. It is known that the rebel party's conspiracy to launch an uprising must not have been a matter of a day or two. However, until now, the content of their plan has begun to be revealed. It is reported that the rebel party's original plan was to launch simultaneous attacks in various border areas (Seville in the south, San Sebastian in the north, and Barcelona in the east), converging on the capital to make the government caught off guard, and the regime would be readily available. However, since the air force did not rebel, and most of the security forces remained loyal to the government, a part of the above plan was foiled. In addition, many rebel generals and officers used the excuse that the republican system was threatened since the Popular Front cabinet came to power, and persuaded the soldiers to rebel. The soldiers were unaware for a while and were given what they were. Now, most have realized that they have defected after the militia of the Popular Front won, and this is another reason why the rebel party's plan has been hit. Currently, the government army and the rebel party are still at war, and the situation is more intense than ever. Although the government wants to quickly put out the flames of the rebellion, this rebellion will have a profound impact on the political situation in Spain, and there are fears that it is something that the authorities cannot foresee.

<h3>The Truth About the Rebellion in the South; The Port of Almería Is Said to Be Recaptured</h3>

A retrospective account is as follows: This mutiny was led by General Goded. The participants included 5,000 soldiers and some civilians. General Galasco, the commander of the Catalonia garrison, issued martial law after the alarm was raised in Morocco. The rebel army originally planned to attack on Saturday morning, but their conspiracy was detected by the police, and the police deployed machine guns in advance at key locations to stand by. Fierce street fighting broke out between the University Square, Catalonia Square, and between Carrer de les Corts Catalanes and Diputació, and bloody battles also broke out in front of the barracks. From 10:00 to 11:00 on Sunday morning, the garrison and the police repeatedly engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the rebel army in order to prevent the rebel army from invading other places. Colonel Sandino also led five aircraft to assist the government army in quelling the rebellion. The Communist Party also joined the government army in combat. (21st Nationalist Electric)</p>
<p>Rabat, French Morocco, North Africa The port of Almería in southern Spain has been recaptured by the government army. The details of the process are worth mentioning. First, the Spanish cruiser "Libertad" arrived at the British port of Gibraltar from the port of Tangier in North Africa and planned to refuel there, but was refused by the British authorities. The ship then sailed to the port of Almería (then in the hands of the rebel army) and was able to assist the government army in opening fire and bombarding the rebel army. After a fierce battle between the two sides, the port was finally recaptured. General Deliano, the leader of the rebel army in Seville and commander of the Andalusia Division, upon hearing the news, has dispatched reinforcements to the port in an attempt to counterattack. The rest of Seville province remained calm this morning. The local military authorities have taken various measures to ensure that food supplies are not cut off. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>

According to news from Huelva, three clergy there attacked Marxist party members and declared their support for the Fascist Party and were arrested by the civilian administrator. (22nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid The situation in the capital was restored to normal last night. Many rioters who opened fire on passers-by were arrested by the military police. Seventy percent of the militias in the capital have boarded trucks and gone to the northern and southern fronts to suppress the rebel army. Interior Minister Pozas declared at 1:00 this morning that the cities of Gijón, Almería, and Alcalá de Henares (all near the capital) had been recaptured by the government army, and several rebel leaders were arrested in Alcalá de Henares. Currently, only the three cities of Zaragoza, Valladolid, and Seville are still in the hands of the rebel army. A column of government troops has set out from Barcelona, ​​preparing to recapture Zaragoza, while Seville has also been surrounded by the government army.

It is feared that if the parties of the Spanish Popular Front are able to quell the rebellion, the leftist parties in Portugal will be encouraged to revolt against the government led by the current President Carmona and Prime Minister Salazar. Historically, Britain and Portugal cooperate in emergencies and maintain friendly relations. The Portuguese government also grants British warships preferential rights in Portuguese territorial waters. If the current Portuguese government is overthrown, the existing relationship between Britain and Portugal will be severely harmed. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Representatives from Britain, France, and Belgium Begin Talks in London This Morning, Discussing Solutions to the General European Situation, Preparing for Future Five-Power Conference, Britain Advocates Realism and is Willing to Accommodate Germany</h3>
<p>(London) The talks between Britain, France, and Belgium are scheduled to begin at 10:30 AM tomorrow at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street.

<p>(London) Regarding the holding of a second Locarno Conference, Britain, France, and Belgium have each issued communiqués in their respective capitals. It is learned that while the British government has accepted the wording of the communiqués this morning, it still insists that the talks being held in London are only preliminary in nature, and that the term "conference" should be reserved for the five-power meeting of Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy to be held in Brussels next month. At this time, it would be more accurate to refer to the gathering of the three countries' representatives as "talks." The current cabinet places the greatest emphasis on the future five-power conference, not the three-power talks. It also believes that efforts are continuing to find ways to involve Germany in jointly resolving the general European situation. Therefore, while the mutual assistance obligations previously offered by France and Belgium, namely the military assistance measures stipulated in the annex to the first Locarno Conference agreement in March of this year, remain effective, they should not be regarded as permanent. After the five-power conference is held, it is necessary to first ascertain Germany's true intentions regarding various European issues before proceeding to seek a solution to the general European situation. The main goal of current British foreign policy is to restore the Locarno Treaty system and include Germany and Italy in it, so that Europe does not split into two groups and create a confrontational situation. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Members of Parliament in the parliament lounge recently stated that the most important issue discussed by the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium is the issue of German troops stationed in the Rhineland. The French government is determined not to accept this fait accompli. The British government, on the other hand, is committed to realism and believes that continuing to insist on German troop withdrawal is futile and should be abandoned. (Havas, 21st)</p>

It stated, "The autonomous rights that Danzig possesses are not to be shared with the League of Nations. The relationship between Danzig and Poland is actually a relationship between two autonomous countries. Danzig has autonomous rights, and its government can enact laws. This is different from the Memel region, which is only an autonomous region." (Havas, 21st)</p>

In addition, the German government had previously issued an order requiring tourists visiting Austria to pay a tax of 1,000 marks to restrict Germans from traveling to Austria. This measure will be abolished by the German government. Other steps will be decided and implemented by the authorities of the two countries within this month. (Havas, 21st)</p>

Sales in major Parisian stores have increased in the past two weeks, and this activity has greatly helped bond sales. Valliot also stated that the Bank of France has reduced the discount rate from 6% to 3% since June 15th. At the same time, the price of public bonds has gradually increased, and the outflow of gold has returned to the national treasury. Regarding the new measures for declaring overseas deposits, Valliot issued a warning, stating that after the amnesty expires on August 23rd, the law will not be lenient towards those who violate this law again. Valliot concluded, "Hope is now gradually being realized. If economic activity can increase its pace as we hope, France's finances will definitely recover." (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>US Large-Scale Silver Purchases</h3>
<p>Still Unable to Achieve Goals of Silver Purchase Act, Gold-Silver Ratio Increasingly Distant</p>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce released a report today stating that although the US government has made large-scale silver purchases, it has still been unable to achieve the goals of the Silver Purchase Act, reducing the gold-silver ratio. Cash imports this year have reached $519,612,415 so far, more than four times the amount of silver imports during the same period. Therefore, the United States has failed in its goal to achieve a gold-silver ratio of 3:1. Silver imports this year have reached $120,493,167 so far. Although domestically produced silver is not included in this figure, the Bureau of Mines estimates that the government has purchased only $35,000,000 worth of domestically produced silver, while it has purchased $129,000,000 worth of domestically produced gold during the same period. Therefore, the gold-silver ratio has become increasingly distant. (National Telegraph, 21st)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Authorities to Reform Current Gendarmerie System</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the recent serious situation, the Army authorities have decided to reform the military police system. The current Japanese gendarmerie system was implemented by order in the 31st year of Meiji and is under the jurisdiction of the Minister of the Army, performing both military police and administrative judicial police functions. However, the current gendarmerie organization is unable to fully implement these tasks, so it is being greatly reformed to prevent illegal incidents within the Army. The recent frequent occurrence of espionage incidents and other military administrative and judicial police incidents will be improved by increasing the number of gendarmerie, selecting outstanding individuals from active-duty officers, and sending them to the Imperial University or other universities to receive education, so as to cultivate gendarmerie that can adapt to the times.

<h3>### Kong Xiangxi Discusses Promoting Income Tax Collection Method Intends to Adopt Reporting System Collection of Funds to Adopt Separate Responsibility System</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Provisional Income Tax Regulations have been officially promulgated by the National Government. When the Central News Agency reporter visited Minister Kong yesterday, he inquired about how it will be implemented in the future. The main points of Minister Kong's speech are recorded as follows: Income tax is a good tax commonly used in various countries around the world. Our country has repeatedly discussed its implementation, but it has not yet been realized. Now that these regulations have completed the legislative procedures and have been officially promulgated by the National Government, they can be implemented immediately, which is a gratifying event. Considering that the income tax rates in various countries are high, for example, the most recent British system levies four shillings and sixpence per pound for the net income of each year starting from one hundred pounds, and an additional surtax is levied for those exceeding two thousand pounds. The US system levies 4% on the net income of each year starting from US$1,000, and from 5% to 59% when it exceeds US$4,000. The German system levies 10% on the net income of each year from 1,100 marks to 8,000 marks, and from 12.5% to 40% above 8,000 marks. The Japanese system levies tax on the net income of each year starting from 600 yuan, with tax rates ranging from a minimum of 8 per thousand to a maximum of 360 per thousand. At the beginning of its establishment in our country, the government, considering the people's hardships, set the tax rate at a lower level. As for the collection method, it is now planned to adopt a reporting system, with strict verification by government offices. If the report is not accurate, the state will impose strict sanctions according to law. Therefore, the procedure is quite simple, and methods such as prior registration and investigation will not be adopted immediately. This department is currently drafting the implementation rules, and soliciting the opinions of experts, scholars, and related organizations for research. Since income tax is most easily evaded, at the beginning of its implementation, the social environment should be carefully observed, and efforts should be made to meet the actual situation, so as to avoid cunning people from being spared by chance, and honest people from bearing the sole responsibility of paying taxes, which would defeat the government's original intention of promoting good taxes. The original purpose of the government is not the amount of tax revenue, but the vigorous reform of the tax system. Taxpayers should understand the government's intention of light taxation and honestly avoid deception, so as to express their sincerity in loving and saving the country. After the income tax is implemented, the income donations previously collected by the Central Party Department from public officials will no longer be levied. The government has already made a decision on this point. I have ordered the responsible personnel to strictly handle the collection of this tax in accordance with the following guidelines: (1) A new tax must be approached with new talents and a new spirit. All personnel must be selected through screening and examinations, and guaranteed. Emphasis must be placed on the training of young people, so as to utilize their energetic and enterprising spirit, and to prevent those with habits of laziness from mingling among them. (2) The collection and receipt of funds must adopt a separate responsibility system, so as to achieve the effect of mutual supervision. (3) Efforts should be made to save on the cost of collecting new taxes, and the procedures should be simplified. Finally, Minister Kong also said that at the beginning of the implementation of income tax, it is difficult for all measures to be perfect. It is hoped that all parties will provide more guidance. If there are brilliant opinions, I will accommodate them as much as possible, so that a good tax system can be promoted to perfection. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Total of Annulled Heavy and Miscellaneous Taxes in Various Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) From the Fifth Plenary Session of the National Congress last year to the present, the Ministry of Finance has continued to receive reports from various provinces and cities on the abolishment of heavy and miscellaneous taxes.

The ministry will also pay special attention when reviewing the budgets of various provinces and counties in the future. All tax levies involving the nature of heavy and miscellaneous taxes will be corrected separately, so that local taxes and levies will gradually return to the right track, and the people's hardships will also be alleviated.

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Central Observatory, its director Yu Qingsong and researcher Chen Zunhui, after observing the solar eclipse in Japan, received a telegram from the International Astronomical Society stating that a bright star was discovered near the Cepheid variable star in the constellation Cepheus. The brightness at that time was magnitude 4, and it gradually rose to magnitude 1.5. On the night of the 21st, after the thunderstorm, around 2:00 AM, the weather cleared. Yu and Chen observed in the middle of the night and found that it had dropped to below magnitude 5. At the same time, a new comet was discovered in its vicinity, which is the first comet to be discovered this year, named Peltier. The brightness is magnitude 4, and the position is declination north 55 degrees, right ascension 23 degrees 5 minutes (in Cassiopeia, near several stars forming a W shape east of Polaris). It moves south by 2 degrees and the right ascension moves by 1 degree each day. On August 4th, the brightness may reach magnitude 3, making it the only comet visible to the naked eye in the past sixteen years. The central nucleus is very large, and the surroundings are cloudy with a tail, radiating light quite far. Once this comet disappears, it cannot be seen again for hundreds of years. The observatory is still continuing to observe and photograph its spectrum for spectroscopic research. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Our Country's Overseas Chinese Workers in Southeast Asia Smoking National Labour Bureau Suggests Improvement by Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At this year's National Labour Conference, in view of the report "Opium and Labour" compiled by the International Labour Bureau, it was recognized that smoking by overseas Chinese workers in Southeast Asia is sufficient to hinder social and economic development and may increase mortality. It is believed that this scourge is caused by poor working conditions and state-run smoking establishments. It is suggested that various governments adopt improvement measures, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Reduce working hours, (2) Improve treatment, (3) Universalize sanitation facilities, (4) Workers' groups should have appropriate organizations. Its decision is that for those who are allowed to sell cigarettes in the colonies, the restriction methods are: (1) Opium is allowed to be sold to registered smokers, (2) Smokers must be registered, (3) Registration is limited to one year, (4) All registered smokers are not allowed to purchase cigarettes after five years, (5) The amount of cigarettes sold to licensed smokers should be reduced by one-fifth each year, (6) Establish smoking cessation hospitals, (7) Formulate a five-year smoking ban plan, (8) Prevent workers from buying and smoking private cigarettes.

<h3>Tianjin Rickshaw Merchants Petition the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the issue of rickshaw operators resisting the British concession's rickshaw inspection fee, on the morning of the 22nd, more than two hundred rubber-wheeled rickshaw merchants carried a petition to the Social Bureau, requesting that they forward it to the British Public Works Bureau to negotiate the cancellation of the new inspection fee law. Section Chief Han met with them on behalf of the bureau and worked hard to address their concerns. The crowd then went to the municipal government to petition. However, the mayor's secretary was not present, so they dispersed without results. They plan to continue appealing on the 23rd. The British Public Works Bureau believes that the lack of rickshaws within the concession causes great inconvenience to transportation. They have ordered plainclothes detectives to lure and arrest more than ten rickshaw pullers. The vehicles were detained, and the people were released, and told to quickly pay the fees. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Tianjin Social Bureau Director Ma Yanzhong, both sides have their own reasons regarding the rickshaw owners' resistance to the British Public Works Bureau's fees. The municipal government has ordered Section Chief Pan Yushu to visit the British authorities in a private capacity to mediate. The lack of a swift resolution to this matter has had a great impact on the city, with ten thousand rickshaw pullers unemployed, which is also a serious matter. On the 22nd, in order to maintain traffic within the concession, the British Public Works Bureau continued to order the public bus to increase its services, and also rented dozens of rickshaws at high prices, ordering street cleaners to temporarily pull them and solicit business on the streets. The bureau has been willing to resolve the matter peacefully due to the large losses incurred from the delay in resolution. (Special dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Department in North China to Directly Develop North China's Economy</h3>
<p>Cangshi Road Construction Still in Limbo; Japanese Army Department Decides to Proceed Step by Step</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The construction of the Cangshi Railway, despite much publicity, remains undecided. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council appointed Pan Yukui, the head of the Political Affairs Department, as the director of the Engineering Bureau. Pan expressed a passive attitude, remaining indecisive. The Japanese side intends that the total cost of the railway should be 20 million yuan. Apart from the Japanese side having priority investment rights, it will not allow any European or American countries to intervene. However, according to the plan, the Japanese side will provide materials instead of cash, with steel rails, vehicles, sleepers, etc., all supplied by Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway), priced fairly. The Chinese side, in addition to land and labor, must raise cash, which can be sourced from government allocations or commercial collections. However, there is strong opposition to using funds from the Beining Railway, as the Beining Railway's annual income is limited. If it is forced to bear this huge sum, it will be difficult to raise funds, and there are concerns that construction may be delayed midway, affecting the project. Furthermore, the Beining Railway was originally built with British loans. Diverting its funds to the Cangshi Railway's construction costs would be tantamount to allowing British capital to join, which does not align with the principles held by the Japanese side. Therefore, this point has been repeatedly expressed to Chen Juesheng, the chairman of the Transportation Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council is currently facing financial difficulties. Apart from the Beining Railway's income, which can be used with the approval of the Finance and Railway Ministries, there are no other sources to provide funds. Consequently, surveying and planning are stalled. The project cannot commence immediately due to this unresolved issue. The Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee and the Cangshi Railway Engineering Bureau have not actively prepared. The land for the railway's foundation was purchased from the people during the Beiyang government era. In 1930, the Ministry of Railways took over, dispatching four commissioners to be stationed within the Tianjin office of the Jinpu Railway Bureau, responsible for managing files and renting out land. They are still continuing this management. The Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee and the Cangshi Railway Engineering Bureau have not contacted them for inventory. Recently, unscrupulous gentry from various parts of southern Hebei, colluding with ronin (masterless samurai), are soliciting shares everywhere under the name of the Cangshi Railway. The Transportation Committee has received numerous complaints from those who have been deceived and has ordered investigations from all parties. The Japanese Garrison Army Headquarters in North China, regarding economic development, realized that the distance was quite significant after Wang Kemin came north and met with Tashiro twice to exchange views. The Japanese side expected North China's economic industrialists to invest, with the Japanese side providing technical and material assistance. In reality, due to the general wealth and banking groups' distrust of the current situation, they perceive investment as still too risky. After Wang's return south, his return north is uncertain. The Japanese Ambassador to China's proposed economic cooperation with our government is also difficult to achieve concrete results for a time. The Army Department, considering the slow progress hindering future achievements, convened a meeting of resident military officers in Tianjin on the 20th of this month, presided by Commander Tashiro. In addition to listening to a report by senior staff officer Ishii Yoshie on attending the Shanghai military officer meeting, they discussed the point of economic development and decided to utilize the Economic Advisory Department attached to the Army Department to make it active, working in step with the Mantetsu Tianjin office to directly develop North China's economy. Even if the achievements are only a fraction, they will not be considered too small. This will be implemented after approval from the highest Japanese military headquarters. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Rampant Smuggling in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Bags of White Sugar Being Dumped in Various Counties via Wuhu; Two Civilian Ships Caught Smuggling Hardware in a Single Day</p>
<p>Wuhu dispatch: Due to Wuhu's transportation connections, since smuggling became rampant in North China, there has been deep concern about its encroachment here. Various industry-based anti-smuggling teams have been strictly preventing it, but there is still a sense that prevention is difficult and sometimes impossible. The Xinyi Company, which emerged in response, has successively transported over ten thousand bags of white sugar to Wuhu. In addition to selling to local sugar merchants, it is also being dumped in inland counties such as Xuancheng, Nanling, Fanchang, Gaochun, Dangtu, Hexian, and Wuwei. As a result, sales of domestic sugar and Taikoo &amp; Dutch sugar have significantly decreased. The sugar industry is suffering an indescribable blow, and everyone is lamenting. Recently, the general merchandise industry discovered a general merchandise store on the riverside, claiming to be capitalized by Japanese merchants, specializing in the trading of cube sugar and seafood, and not paying business tax. Therefore, it has been decided to sever all ties with it. Just as various industries were indignant, anti-smuggling teams successively uncovered two cases of hardware smuggling. Both were purchased wholesale from Shanghai and transported by hired civilian ships. One was the Yuandahe Hardware Store on Chang Street, owned by Chen Shaoyu, carrying thirty packages of electrical materials, thirty packages of fish oil, and one box of hardware and electrical materials. The other was the Dayoufeng Hardware Store on Guohuo Road, owned by Zhao Wenxian, with the entire ship fully loaded with hardware and electrical materials. The customs dispatched Jiang Xunsi Zhu Huanchao, along with customs officers and anti-smuggling inspectors, to inspect each item by speedboat. The cargo ships were taken to the customs for interrogation. Zhu Wenli, the escort of Yuandahe, was transferred to the Commissioner's Office by the Public Security Bureau for investigation. All sectors are paying close attention to this. Qian Zhongyuan, the chairman of the Hardware Trade Guild, has reported to the County Chamber of Commerce for assistance and is actively lobbying and explaining. (21st)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Robbery of Villagers in Longxing Township</p>
<p>Xu Shusong, a villager from the sixth village, Zhongjiajing, seventh bao, ninth jia, third household in Longxing Township, the first district of the county, is relatively well-off. He used to work as a rent collector for the Geng family in the city. Recently, due to the hot weather, he hired workers to thresh at night in order to sell the threshed rice at a good price. Yesterday (21st) at around 10 PM, as the workers were finishing their work and dispersing, suddenly seven or eight robbers, speaking with local accents, broke into the house. Each held iron rulers, flashlights, and other items as weapons. With three people acting as lookouts outside, they bound the homeowner Xu Shusong and searched for an hour, carrying away their loot and leaving. Afterwards, the homeowner reported the loss to the local police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Shops Not Allowed to Close</p>
<p>Long Tiyao, the magistrate of this county, believes that during the validity period of the licenses held by local opium dens and smoking parlors, they should continue to supply licensed smokers with opium and smoking equipment without interruption. Since the strict implementation of smoker control, smokers must have designated shops to purchase and smoke from, and must not purchase and smoke at will. Therefore, unless shops are closed down or have special circumstances and report to the county for approval, they must not close on their own. It has been found that the Xinxing and Tiansheng smoking parlors closed briefly without prior notice and have been fined accordingly. This matter is crucial to the future of the prohibition laws. Yesterday, the county government issued a notice to all opium dens and smoking parlors.</p>
<p>Organizing an Anti-Smuggling Committee</p>
<p>The Wuxi General Merchandise Trade Guild, recognizing the increasing severity of rampant smuggling, convened its 19th Executive Committee meeting yesterday. The chairman, Zhu Fuming, resolved to: (1) Organize the Wuxi County General Merchandise Trade Guild Assistance Anti-Smuggling Committee, with all executive committee members serving as ex officio members, and Zhu Fuming elected as chairman. (2) Establish four sections: Investigation, Review, Public Relations, and Documentation, with Zhang Yunting appointed as director of the Investigation Section, Zhou Lvfu as director of the Review Section, Jiang Xikang as director of the Public Relations Section, and Xu Jianyun as director of the Documentation Section. Work will commence immediately to assist in cracking down on smuggling and to prevent it. A letter will be sent to the Chamber of Commerce for record.</p>
<p>Embezzlement Case in the Land Tax Office</p>
<p>Deng Jiqian, a clerk in the Fee Department of the County Government's Land Tax Office, recently reported his adopted son, Deng Gaozhang, for stealing string tickets and colluding in embezzlement. County Magistrate Long instructed Director Fang to conduct a secret investigation, and Deng Gaozhang, along with related individuals Zhou Xilun, Zhang Huisheng, Zhou Yinru, Zhu Shuqing, and Zhou Yuedu, were all summoned for questioning and detained. Deng Gaozhang is considered the most culpable, and Deng has confessed to embezzling over one thousand yuan. However, the old tickets from 1938 to 1935 have not yet been fully audited, so the exact amount of Deng's embezzlement is unknown. Once the audit is completed, the truth will be revealed, and they will be ordered to compensate the full amount. The detainees jointly submitted a petition to the county government, requesting bail. County Magistrate Long approved it and ordered each to provide a written surety of five thousand yuan. Currently, Zhang Huisheng, Zhu Shuqing, Zhou Yinru, and Zhou Xilun have found suitable guarantors and been released on bail, with the guarantors pledging that they will be available whenever summoned. If the guaranteed individuals evade being summoned, the guarantors are willing to bear the responsibility of compensating the full amount. Deng Gaozhang and Zhou Yuedu remain in custody due to their inability to find guarantors. It is heard that Zhou Yinru and Zhu Shuqing believe they have been falsely implicated by Deng and have hired lawyers to file lawsuits in court for legal recourse.</p>

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Flood Victims Along the River Petition</p>
<p>Along the riverbanks of Yaodong Wolf Mountain in Tong County, the stone groynes on the river surface have sunk, and the violent impact of the high tide has caused severe collapses. Continuous days of storms and rain have exacerbated the situation, turning the riverbanks into "running horses." The flood victims from various embankments, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, have come to the city to petition the Party and government agencies for the swift implementation of rescue and protection projects.</p>
<p>Overhaul of Nantong Cloth Industry</p>
<p>In order to develop foreign trade, the Nantong native cloth industry has established a cloth market to centralize the collection of cloth. Recently, due to many weaving households engaging in forgery for profit, which has affected cloth sales, standards have been discussed and established, and measures for punishing inferior cloth have been formulated for thorough rectification. The county government has issued a public notice for implementation.</p>
<h3>Haizhou</h3>
<p>Rampant Banditry in Ganyu</p>
<p>Ganyu County is adjacent to Shandong Province and is a haven for bandits. Several years ago, it completely transformed into a bandit world. Since the implementation of the Baojia system and repeated suppression by the Provincial Security Team, the number of bandits killed and who surrendered is not small. However, cunning bandits and those with serious cases have all fled to Shandong. Now that the green crops are growing, and because the Provincial Security Team has been transferred, escaped bandits have taken the opportunity to return to their hometowns to rob and kidnap. This happens from time to time (Recently, more than ten bandits from Batiaozhuang, Guowei Township, the sixth district, kidnapped five villagers, and a villager, Wen Yuan, from the sixth bao of Jinshan Township, was also kidnapped by bandits, who also shot and injured a water buffalo. At the same time, in Huandunbu, the fourth district, more than ten bandits suddenly appeared, firing shots near the district office and carrying off villagers. As a result, several villagers were kidnapped. On the border between the county and Tancheng County in Shandong, bandits have gathered more than two hundred people, causing panic among the population and a sense of impending doom).</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Traffic Accident in Pingjia</p>
<p>A bus operating between Pinghu and Zhapu in Jiaxing, while departing from Jiaxing at around 8 AM on the 22nd, passed through the Jianqiao street intersection. A pedestrian, Yang, happened to be walking out of Jianqiao Street, and due to being unable to avoid it in time, was knocked down. The wheels ran over his left leg, causing him to lose consciousness immediately. The bus, with license plate Zhejiang No. 451, was detained by the police on duty. The driver, Xu Minqian (26 years old, from Qingtian, Zhejiang), was sent to the court for interrogation and then released on bail. The injured person was sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment, but due to the broken leg, treatment is expected to be difficult.</p>

The car failed to brake in time, causing the child to be injured on the head. At the time, blood flowed like a river. He was sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries are serious, and as of noon on the 22nd, he is still in danger and may not survive.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>Discovery of Poisonous Smuggled Oil</p>
<p>Amidst the smuggling situation, various tax-evaded goods continue to be dumped southward, with white sugar and rayon being the most common. After strict inspections by various county authorities, they have gradually decreased. However, poisonous smuggled oil has recently been discovered in Shouxian, Yingshang, Tianjia'an and other places in northern Anhui. This smuggled oil is also extracted from soybeans. The oil's composition is mixed with human skin and bones, and although the toxicity is not severe, it still hinders hygiene when consumed. Moreover, the oil price is cheaper, and it is all trafficked and sold by ronin and traitors. This proves that it is smuggled oil without a doubt. After poisonous sugar, poisonous oil has emerged, which can also reveal the poisonous scheme of a certain country.</p>
<p>Anecdotes from a Southern Tour</p>
<h3>Jiangshan: More People Than Land</h3>
<p>—Special Correspondent Shi Ying</p>
<p>From Quzhou to Jiangshan, taking a morning bus, the green mountains and fields along the way offer endless beautiful scenery. The highway is built with gravel, and it can be driven on even in rainy weather. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway runs alongside it, and you can often see the race between cars and trains. The fact that the highway here is not planted with trees on either side suddenly reminded me of the highways in southern Zhejiang. On both sides, "I ask about the willows, I ask about the paulownia," and "the car speeds through," often revealing a few acres of lotus ponds through the willow gaps, like driving on the Su Causeway in West Lake. I don't feel any of the fatigue of the journey. After a while, I arrived in Jiangshan, checked into the Dachang Hotel in the city, which was renovated from a temple. The roof is high and airy, suitable for summer living. There is also the Jiangshan Hotel, which is also very old. The rest are mostly small inns. There is not even a good bathhouse in the entire city.</p>
<p>Twenty-five kilometers south of Jiangshan city is Mount Jianglang, and on the mountain are the Three Stone Peaks, standing tall and reaching into the sky, all several hundred feet high, visible from below but unclimbable. The county gets its name from this. On the outskirts of the city are also Rooster Mountain and Tiger Mountain, which are also several strange large stones piled on top of the mountains, like a rooster's comb and a crouching tiger (actually, they look very much like the humps and heads of crouching camels). Looking up in the city, you can just see their similar parts, that is, the rooster's head and the tiger's head and tail, protruding and receding on the eaves and corners of the streets. The people of Jiangshan are strong and fierce, and cases of robbery and murder occur almost every day. Especially during the hot summer, there are often tragic events of bandits being executed. The county government dares not place rickshaws in front of its door, for fear that they will be called to pull criminals to the execution ground. Feng Shui masters attribute this to the bad appearance of Tiger Mountain. Although many people are superstitious, in reality, these strange mountains and rocks have no eyes and are in the wrong place, so they suffer injustice.</p>
<p>Jiangshan, as a remote and small county, has an exceptionally large number of lawsuits. This is a fact. According to the person in charge of the local court, since the court was established in 1928, over one hundred cases have been transferred from the county government, some of which have been pending for more than two years without being tried, which is truly unjust. Statistics on the number of lawsuits accepted each year have increased from over one thousand cases to around one thousand five hundred cases. On average, more than four cases are accepted every day, and the cases of bandits and Red Pill criminals that are transferred to the county government for trial are not included. If we combine and analyze them, the first category is robbery, accounting for 40 percent (according to the county magistrate, it has gradually increased to 60 percent). The second category is assault, accounting for 30 percent. The third category is deprivation of freedom, accounting for 20 percent. The fourth category is Red Pill criminals, accounting for 10 percent. In addition, there are only two communist criminals who endanger the Republic. It can be seen that very few criminals aim to endanger national public safety, while robbery crimes of an economic nature account for more than half. The reasons for the second category of assault crimes are mostly due to rent and debt collection, so it can be said that most of them are for livelihood issues. The motives for other various crimes are also inevitably directly or indirectly related to livelihood issues.</p>
<p>At present, Jiangshan has two hundred people in prison in the county government and two hundred and eighty in the court, excluding the eighty or so on parole, totaling nearly four hundred. The limited prison is holding an increasing number of criminals, and problems often arise in management and supply. In addition, ignorant and foolish people are occasionally caught in the legal net, or are incited by malicious criminals, becoming increasingly depraved, or die in prison due to the spread of disease. It is said that the number is not small. This remote and small county has so many criminals, and observing the future, there is a crisis that will only worsen. The following briefly describes the situation, hoping that society will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The main reasons for this problem are: first, the people are relatively strong and fierce. This is undeniable. During the severe drought two years ago, Zhejiang was shocked by the news of farmers forcing the county magistrate to pay respects to the City God to pray for rain. Later, they even smashed the Party headquarters and dragged the chairman of the Farmers' Association out to bake in the sun - this farcical drama was played by the people of Jiangshan. A few years ago, there was a rice shortage, and the farmers also flocked to the county government to coerce them. At that time, a new county magistrate surnamed Mi, who had just taken office for one day, was forced to say angrily, "I am only surnamed Mi, and I did not bring rice with me. The rice is in the rice shop, what are you doing here?" So they robbed all the rice shops, and the county magistrate Mi was immediately removed from his post due to the rice problem. The masses are so strong, and private individuals are not weak either. In the southeast two townships, especially in the twenty-seventh township and eighteen fortresses, there are so-called "cultivating" and "robbing" farmer bandits. For example, if there are four brothers, two or three have already been executed for robbery, and the rest still want to engage in that adventurous business without capital. At least they also want to kill the person who reported the crime.</p>
<p>Second, the arrowhead boats in the Qiantang River used to be mostly from Jiangshan. There are 10,000 households of boatmen, who navigate and transport goods here. There are also often four or five thousand porters who distribute goods to Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces. Wild bamboo grows lush and green on the four mountains, and residents rely on papermaking for a living. There are over one hundred paper mills, employing one thousand and several hundred workers. In total, there are five or six thousand boatmen, porters, and paper workers. Now, due to the development of transportation, boatmen and porters are completely unemployed, and paper workers have also been idle for many years due to the loss of the Northeast market. "Only when clothing and food are sufficient do people know etiquette and righteousness; only when the granaries are full do they know honor and shame." Among this large group of unemployed people, there are naturally many who are the protagonists of increasing robbery.</p>
<p>Third, the total population of the county is 290,000, but there are only 300,000 mu of cultivated land, averaging only 1.23 mu per person, less than the minimum of 3 mu per person. With so few producers and so many consumers, it is no wonder that they are trapped in an environment where "in good years, they suffer all their lives, and in bad years, they cannot avoid robbery." Usually, when renting land, the landlords get 60 percent, and the tenants get only 40 percent. Because there is little land and many people, they have to compete for planting to make a living. In recent years, the implementation of the 25% rent reduction (that is, the tenant farmers take 25% of the harvest first, and then divide the rest equally with the landlord, so the tenants get 62.5% and the landlord gets 37.5%) has been very helpful to ordinary semi-self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers. The attitude of the farmers in the formerly bandit-ridden areas has fortunately improved as a result. However, the food shortage cannot be compensated for. According to Mr. Song Rilong of the Party Committee, who recently returned from inspections in the twenty-seventh township (120 li from the city) and other places, "Only 5% of the villages eat rice, 45% eat sweet potatoes and other coarse grains, and the remaining 50% gather wild grass (also known as bitter leaves) to cook and eat." This is solid evidence.</p>
<p>Analyzing and summarizing the above three reasons, "more people than land" can be said to be the root cause. Looking at the history of one period of peace and one period of chaos, it is based on the population and land problem. When the cultivated land is vast and the population is sparse, the farmers are well-fed and clothed, and the "world is at peace." Later, due to the rapid increase in population and insufficient cultivated land allocation, people feel increasingly lacking in food, and when they encounter famine, vagrant bandits arise, and the "world is in great chaos," killing people in cities and fields. Until the death of most of the population, people are tired of chaos, and outstanding talents emerge to correct the chaos, allowing the surviving people to divide the remaining land of most of the dead, work hard and harvest, and the picture of prosperity and peace returns. In the future, with the progress of science and the improvement of farming systems, it is not yet certain that this cyclical tragedy will not be repeated. However, the current crisis of "more people than land" in Jiangshan is very terrifying. The so-called strong and fierce people are whipped and forged by the whip of bitter life. As for the unemployed group's helplessness, it is even more because the living space is too narrow to be accommodated. These are all obvious facts. The only way to solve this problem is to "implement an immigration policy." Hengfeng and Yiyang in eastern Jiangxi and Pucheng and Jian'ou in northern Fujian are mostly recovered red areas. Often, dozens or hundreds of miles of good farmland are still barren today. If immigrants are brought from Jiangshan, they can arrive in the evening after starting in the morning. I hope that the authorities will not just talk about it and implement it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Statements by Song and Zou</p>
<p>Song Zi-liang said, "Guangdong Province is my hometown. I am honored to be appointed by the government to reorganize its finances. However, my role is primarily to assist.

<p>Statement by Wu Jiantao</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Jiantao flew to Nanjing from Jiangxi the day before yesterday and came to Shanghai by train with Financial Secretary Kong that night. He arrived yesterday morning and traveled with Mr. Song and others. According to Mr. Wu, he received the telegrammed order the day before yesterday and rushed to come without adequate preparation. His position as Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Finance is temporarily being held by Liu Tigan, the Secretary-General of the provincial government, and he has not been able to relinquish it. His new position as Director of the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Inter-regional Consolidated Tax Bureau is only a concurrent appointment. He will need to return to Jiangxi in about two months. Regarding the plan to reorganize the consolidated tax in Guangdong Province, he will decide after arriving in Guangdong and assessing the current situation. What can be reported at this time is that the general direction will be to maintain the original framework while increasing the strength of new personnel to strive for improvement.</p>
<p>Statement by Tang Shumin</p>
<p>According to Tang, the Ministry of Finance has appointed Song Zi-liang as Special Commissioner and Director of the Department of Finance to reorganize the finances of Guangdong Province, and a reorganization plan has already been determined. He and Bei Songsun are going to Guangdong to inspect the financial institutions of Guangdong Province and to find ways to reform the monetary system of Guangdong Province to complete the implementation of the legal tender policy. As for reforming the silver dollar system, the principle has long been decided and is imperative. How to reform it will be decided after arriving in Guangdong. The date of returning to Shanghai has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Statement by Zhou Shouliang</p>
<p>According to Zhou, he and Li Tisheng were ordered to go to Guangdong to investigate the financial situation of Guangdong Province and plan to return to Shanghai in the short term. The plan to establish a Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank has already been decided, but specific measures will be determined after arriving in Guangdong. These measures will be implemented after being approved by the head office. He has requested leave from the Ministry of Transportation for his concurrent position at the Postal Remittances Bureau, which has been approved.</p>
<p>Chen Xing's Statement</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen, the establishment of a Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank and a Guangzhou branch of the Issuing Reserve Management Committee is imperative. However, at the beginning of the establishment, the monetary system must first be unified. Everything will be implemented as soon as possible after Director Zou and Mr. Tang and Bei return north after their inspection and investigation and the measures are decided. It is understood that there is already an Issuing Management Committee in Guangzhou, and this time it will simply be reorganized to be directly under Shanghai. The selection of committee members will largely remain the same, with Zou Minchu and others continuing to serve. As for the silver in Guangdong Province, it is reported to be 100 million yuan in silver dollars, equivalent to 98 million legal tender yuan.</p>

<h3>Chen Guangfu Speaks</h3>
<p>Denies Sino-American and Sino-Philippine Agreements</p>
<p>Reuter's Shanghai, July 22 - Reports in the Japanese press that a recent Sino-American monetary agreement includes continued loans to China and the purchase of war materials have been solemnly denied today by Chen Guangfu, the chief Chinese negotiator of the agreement. Mr. Chen is the General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and a senior advisor to the Ministry of Finance. He told a Reuter's reporter that his mission to Washington was solely to discuss monetary issues with officials of the U.S. Treasury. As a result of the discussions, the U.S. Treasury has agreed to purchase a large quantity of silver from China to further strengthen China's newly stabilized currency. Mr. Chen also clarified that this measure is purely a commercial transaction and has no political nature whatsoever. Mr. Chen also denied reports that he and Guo Bingwen negotiated a commercial agreement with the Philippines during their recent return to China from the United States. He said that while he did visit President Quezon, the talks were purely social in nature and did not involve Sino-Philippine commercial issues.</p>
<h3>Twenty-One Chambers of Commerce Telegraph, Requesting Postponement of Income Tax; Income Tax Should Be Implemented on the Day That Disguised Likin is Abolished</h3>
<p>The representatives of twenty-one provincial, municipal, and county chambers of commerce holding a meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After deliberation at the joint conference, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance requesting postponement of income tax. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Hankou</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Greetings: Recently received a telegram from the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce stating that the provisional regulations on income tax are awaiting amendment and implementation. At this time of widespread poverty and financial exhaustion, implementation should be postponed to allow for a brief respite. Please maintain a consistent stance, etc. Submitted to the 32nd executive committee meeting of this chamber of commerce today, all members agreed that industry and commerce are declining, all sectors are withering, and the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. All stores are barely maintaining their current status, and those that have not yet collapsed are fortunate enough. Where is there income to speak of? Government officials are not thinking of showing compassion and fostering vitality, but want to forcibly implement income tax. The people are exhausted and cannot even save themselves, how can they bear this heavy burden? The situation is the same everywhere as it is in this city. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is currently inviting fifteen provincial and municipal chambers of commerce to discuss anti-smuggling. It is imperative to telegraph based on the telegram from the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce, submit a special case for discussion, propose to fight vigorously, and telegraph our chamber of commerce's attending representatives Yu Rongqiao and others to explain the reasons for the proposal and to implement the proposal to achieve the goal of postponing implementation, etc. Recorded in the minutes. Specially record the case and telegram to your chamber of commerce. Please submit for discussion and forward to our chamber of commerce representatives Yu Rongqiao and others for reference. Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Ke.</p>
<p>Joint Telegram to Nanjing</p>
<p>Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Greetings: Our chamber of commerce, etc., received an invitation from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to assist in anti-smuggling and to address the issue of amending the Chambers of Commerce Law and the Guild Law. A joint conference was held in Shanghai on Ke day. Today, a telegram was received from the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating (telegram text above). After being submitted for discussion, all members agreed that although income tax is a good tax, when a good tax is implemented, bad taxes should also be abolished. The National Government clearly ordered the abolition of likin many years ago, but many provinces still have disguised likin, such as the Jiangxi Clearance of Bandits and Post-Disaster Donations, the Zhejiang Silk Improvement Fee, the Hunan Production and Sales Tax, the Guangdong Special Tax, the Sichuan Landing Tax, the Guangxi Military Contribution, and the Shaanxi, Gansu, and Yunnan Special Consumption Tax, with countless different names. Whether it is native goods or machine-made domestic products, there is repeated collection, and no one is spared. The tax rate is even ten times higher than the previous likin. While demanding that merchants bear legal burdens, provinces should not be allowed to retain the dregs of likin. This is the first point. Since the business tax was introduced, the business tax bureaus in various provinces have been unable to determine the standard for total business revenue, resulting in frequent disputes with merchants and strikes. Now, in addition to the total business revenue, they must also examine the net profit. The accounting systems of merchants are not standardized, especially in the interior, and there are even those who only show a surplus on paper at the end of each year to please shareholders. If this is regarded as net profit and taxed accordingly, the disputes will be ten times greater than now. This is the second point. Reports state that foreigners will also be taxed equally under the income tax, but as exemplified by the recent agreement on factory inspections in concessions, it can be seen that they will rely on their extraterritorial rights and will not be able to tax foreigners in the future. Taking the example of the Shanghai concessions, which still cannot levy business tax, it can be seen that the introduction of income tax will not only be unable to tax foreigners, but also the merchants in the concessions. The result will only be to drive fish into the deep and fuel the prosperity of the concessions, leading to capital flight. This is the third point. Based on the first point above, the central government must strictly supervise and urge the provinces to abolish likin. Income tax should be implemented on the day that disguised likin is abolished. Merchants can then get a reprieve. Based on the second point above, the authorities must also negotiate on the diplomatic front and ensure that foreigners and concessions are taxed equally. This is necessary to avoid significant damage to national welfare and livelihoods. It was resolved to request the government to postpone the implementation of income tax until the above procedures are fully completed. When the above issues are resolved one by one and it is possible to implement the tax, all matters related to the implementation methods and detailed rules should also be discussed and finalized with the business community in order to ensure the best possible outcome and avoid conflicts. There is a precedent for the previous likin abolition conference. In addition to the accounting system, the attending representatives will discuss the national accounting system improvement plan in detail. Urgently record the case and telegram to be submitted for review. We hope that our request will be approved. We are extremely eager to hear back. The Joint Association of Chambers of Commerce of the seven provinces of Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, and the fourteen municipal and county chambers of commerce of Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hankou, Jinan, Zhenjiang, Guangzhou, Nanchang, Kaifeng, Changsha, Taiyuan, Wuhu, Hangzhou, and Minhou bow down. This document borrows and affixes the seal of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This is stated in combination.</p>
<h3>Grain, Oil, and Cake Industries Donate to Buy Plane for Birthday</h3>
<p>Decision to Donate 100,000 Yuan, Detailed Rules Approved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Committee for the China Aviation Association's Expanded National Aviation Salvation Movement to Raise Funds to Purchase Aircraft and Present Them to the Government for Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday Celebration Committee recently received a letter from the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Industries Association, stating that Generalissimo Chiang swore an oath to launch the Northern Expedition, laid the foundation for China, eradicated the communists, and saved the people. His great achievements will be eternally remembered by the party and the country. This year marks his fiftieth birthday, and this association, in order to express its support, has repeatedly convened meetings and decided to levy a donation on goods from the industry to purchase an aircraft and present it to the government. Detailed rules for various goods donations have been drafted and a date for commencement has been set. The committee has submitted the letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government for approval and filing, and has also sent it to various sectors for reference. The detailed rules are as follows: Detailed Rules for the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Industries Association's Collection of Donations to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebration: 1.

If there are any matters not covered in these detailed rules, they may be amended at any time with approval. Various dance halls are enthusiastically holding entertainment events, and the income will be transferred to donate to purchase aircraft for birthday celebration. The Old Dahua Dance Hall donated all of its income on the 20th, totaling 153.25 national currency yuan, which has already been handed over, and the Aircraft Purchase Commemoration Association has received the receipt. It is reported that the Shengli, Paris, Haoyou, and Mingxing dance halls will also hold events on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Training Aircraft Slightly Damaged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a small aircraft No. 7 of Eurasia Aviation Corporation was practicing take-off and landing in accordance with the training program by a domestic pilot. After the second take-off, the engine speed suddenly decreased, so it could not return to the airport and landed in the fields outside the north of the airport. Except for some damage to the landing gear, personnel and mechanical parts are safe. It is said that the aircraft can be repaired within three days.</p>

<h3>After Yesterday's Third General Meeting, the Chamber of Commerce Joint Conference Concluded. Petitions to Amend Partnership Liability in the Morning, and Committee Members of the Anti-Smuggling Federation Elected in the Afternoon. Representatives of Various Associations Will Petition in the Capital Tomorrow.</h3>
<p>After the opening of the joint conference of chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities, at 10 a.m. yesterday, the presidium, including Wang Xiaolai, visited Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, to petition for the amendment of partnership liability. At 11 a.m., the third general meeting was held, with 36 representatives from various provinces and cities attending. They passed the review report of the commercial law group's proposals and revised the organizational outline of the Anti-Smuggling Federation. At 3 p.m., the meeting continued, and 27 committee members of the Anti-Smuggling Federation were elected. It was resolved to establish the All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the presidium led the chambers of commerce of 21 provinces, cities, and counties to each nominate a representative to gather in Beijing yesterday morning to petition the Central Party Headquarters and other authorities. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting President Sun</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. yesterday, the presidium, consisting of Wang Xiaolai, Yu Rongqiao, Cai Chang, Yuan Duanfu, Yu Xiaochuan, and others, went to Columbia Road to visit Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, to petition for the amendment of Article 681 of the Civil Code regarding joint and several liability for partnership businesses. Wang and others stated that the provision was incompatible with commercial practices and difficult to apply in practice, and indirectly contributed to the decline of commerce. Sun agreed to accept the petition and have the Yuan discuss it in detail, and the petition will be sent directly to the Legislative Yuan. The original petition is recorded as follows: Presented to the President, regarding the petition. It has been found that Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code stipulates that partners bear unlimited joint and several liability. Chambers of Commerce in various provinces believe that this provision is greatly at odds with national conditions and commercial practices, and they have been constantly petitioning for its amendment. The Yuan is requested to respect commercial sentiment and adopt a compromise. There was a proposal by eight legislators, including Wu Kaixian, to enact a Commercial Registration Law as a remedy. Article 9 of the draft law stipulates that partners who register their names, addresses, and capital contributions shall be liable for sharing losses within the limit of their capital contributions. The point of contention over the years could have been resolved, but ultimately, due to the disagreement between the Civil Law Committee and the Commercial Law Committee of the Yuan, the draft law has been stalled since October of the 23rd year. The present delegations attended the joint conference in Shanghai to discuss the tax system and amendment of the Chamber of Commerce Law. In reviewing this, it was decided that if the draft law is stalled because the Commercial Registration Law is a procedural law and the Civil Law is a substantive law, and a procedural law cannot change a substantive law, then the only way to thoroughly remedy the situation is to incorporate the full text of Article 9 of the draft law into Article 681 of the Civil Code as an exception to the second paragraph, and add a sentence at the end of the second paragraph stating that a registration procedure will be separately defined. In this way, there is no contradiction between Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code and the Commercial Registration Law, and the legislative style will be more harmonious. If the only reason is to protect creditor's rights and the method of joint and several liability is insisted upon without any change, then the principle of equal protection for creditors and debtors should be adopted, and this action would not benefit creditors but would only encourage the bad habit of evasion. Chambers of Commerce in various provinces have pointed out the advantages and disadvantages in previous resolutions and dispatches in great detail. If this system is not changed, it will make accounts even more difficult to collect, and commercial ethics will further deteriorate, sinking deeper and becoming more difficult to remedy. The representatives of this delegation are in the commercial world and are well aware of the advantages and disadvantages. Creditor's rights and debts alternate, and it is by no means a one-sided calculation. In order to protect this century-old precedent, we hereby jointly present this petition to the President for consideration. Regarding partnership debt, whether starting with amending Article 681 of the Debt Section of the Civil Code, or maintaining the original proposal to enact a Commercial Registration Law as a remedy, we request a prompt decision to provide a basis for merchants to relieve the desires of merchants over the years, which would be greatly appreciated. Furthermore, this matter is being stamped with the seal of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the venue of the meeting, and we hereby make a joint statement. Respectfully presented to Sun, President of the Legislative Yuan.</p>

<p>The list of 27 committee members of the All-China Anti-Smuggling Federation of Chambers of Commerce is as follows: Luo Huizong, Gao Bochang, Yu Ting, Zheng Longwen, Yu Xiaochuan, Cheng Ganqing, Xu Guosen, Yuan Duanfu, Gu Sumin, Cai Chang, Wan Zhucun, Liang Rendao, Zhu Yaoting, Jia Shaowu, Yuan Yousheng, Zhang Shuliang, Liu Wenting, Chen Xinyan, Tao Yutang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyun, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Ge Jechen, Xu Shufen, Luo Yuming.</p>
<p>Closing Remarks</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaoxiang delivered a closing speech, saying, "This meeting was convened during the height of summer and on short notice. However, we still had representatives from seven provincial federations of chambers of commerce and fourteen city and county chambers of commerce. Originally, there are countless matters that chambers of commerce should discuss together, but considering the priority and urgency, we have focused our discussion on the tax system and the amendment of commercial laws and regulations to avoid being overly broad and building castles in the air. Since the proposals are concentrated on the above two cases, the matters to be discussed during the three-day meeting have been largely clarified. For example, regarding the issue of assisting in anti-smuggling, it has been decided to establish a national anti-smuggling federation to unify methods and facilitate communication. What should be strived for in the future is 'how to do' rather than 'how to say.' In addition, those that have a stake in the tax system and merchants are requesting the government to cut off all disguised surcharges in various provinces and to point out the three major prerequisites that should be paid attention to when starting an income tax and to ask them to adopt it. This matter still requires the national business community to continue to appeal to the government with a consistent spirit. This meeting is only the beginning. Regarding how to amend the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Trade Association Law, this meeting has summarized the opinions of all parties and prepared articles for submission to the legislative authorities for adoption. The time for the realization of this matter is not far off, as the environment has changed, and the claims of the legislative authorities and the business community are now consistent. As for the issue of the quick-liability of partnerships in shops, merchants have been requesting amendments for years, but the compromise proposed by the Legislative Yuan, i.e., separately enacting a Commercial Registration Law for remedy, is that partners who register their names, addresses, and capital contributions with the official treasury shall be liable for losses based on their capital contributions. However, it has been stalled to this day due to inconsistent opinions of the Yuan committee. This meeting believes that the reasons stated in previous years' documents are extremely detailed and that another earnest conversation with the legislative authorities is necessary to bring the opinions into agreement. Therefore, today, we publicly visited President Sun of the Legislative Yuan to ask him to preside over the matter. In short, in recent years, in addition to occasional necessary matters communicated through official documents, there have been very few opportunities for daily contact between chambers of commerce, resulting in the loss of many opportunities for joint cooperation, which is regrettable. This meeting hopes that there will be opportunities for us to meet and exchange views often in the future and will take the National Anti-Smuggling Federation established this time as the starting point, thereby improving the All-China Federation of Chambers of Commerce. This level is the biggest gain of this session. On the day of the end of this session, I would like to add my wishes to this."</p>
<p>Reception and Tour</p>
<p>After the meeting, the representatives of the chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities, including Yu Rongqiao, were invited to visit the General Association for the Manufacture and Sale of Party and National Flags. Zhang Zikang and others were sent by the General Bureau of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, which manufactures the Party and National Flags, to lead them in cars to visit the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company in Gaoqiao. At 7 p.m., the General Bureau hosted a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road. Zhang Zilian gave a report on the establishment of the General Bureau for the Manufacture and Sale, and the event ended with joy at around 9 p.m.</p>
<h3>Stalled Factory Inspection</h3>
<p>We are determined to continue negotiations</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the issue of factory inspection in the Public Concession has been under negotiation for some time. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, had already drafted a proposal that was approved by both parties and seemed to be on the verge of resolution. However, the consular corps of various countries in this port opposed the agreement, arguing that the agreement did not apply to foreign factories with consular jurisdiction in the concession, and proposed to amend the agreement draft, causing it to stall again. A reporter met with a responsible person from the Municipal Government yesterday, who said that the negotiations have been temporarily stalled due to the opposition of the consular corps. Factory inspection concerns our national sovereignty and cannot be ignored. Our side is determined to adhere to our consistent purpose and continue negotiations to achieve our goal.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession held its last meeting before the summer recess at 4:30 p.m. yesterday in the Council Hall. The following directors attended: Arnold, Chairman; Franklin, Porter, Macleod, Tucker, Quo Soon, Cahan, Chiang Yee-ping, Hsu Hsin-loh, Keswick, Hsi Yu-tsin, and Buke. Director-General Fessenden and Chief Secretary Jones were also present. Chairman Arnold presided over the discussion of various routine matters and approved changing Tibet Road to Yu Qiaqing Road and North Tibet Road to Tibet Road. The meeting lasted for two hours. The factory inspection case, which has attracted much attention, was not brought up for discussion because the draft agreement had not been approved by the consular corps, which also instructed the council to request our side to amend it. The council is subject to the consular corps and cannot express dissent. It is reported that negotiations on the case have entered a standstill and will resume in the autumn. The Board of Directors' summer recess will last until September 2.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Quality Inspection</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry ordered it to be launched as scheduled. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry previously received an order from the ministry to prepare for the quality inspection of raw silk. As this matter is of great importance to the future of China's silk industry, a meeting of silk industry representatives from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Shandong provinces was convened last month to gather ideas and opinions. The results of the meeting were reported to the Ministry of Industry for verification. It has been learned that the bureau has received a telegram from Minister Wu, ordering the implementation of raw silk quality inspection from August 1 of this year and the mandatory implementation of grade inspection from February 1 of next year. All white filature silk trade exported from Shanghai shall be based on the results of the bureau's inspection. The grade standards shall be formulated by the bureau and submitted to the ministry for verification before the 15th of next month. It is scheduled to be announced on September 1. After receiving the telegram, the bureau has sent copies of the raw silk quality public weighing and inspection procedures and draft grade standards to the Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and other silk factory trade associations for distribution to various silk factories for study. If there are any comments, they should be sent to the bureau by August 10 for reference and submission to the ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>Doubts about Voucher Tax Stamps, Ministry of Finance Instructs Compliance</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions on how to affix stamp duty to payment vouchers, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, Tax No. 10135, yesterday: "The telegram and attachments have been received in full. Upon investigation, the payment vouchers used by the Zhufeng Tongji Enamel Company, if used within the factory by various departments to receive the funds they need, or by factory staff to receive funds for petty expenses, should be considered for internal use and do not create external rights and obligations. Therefore, there is no need to affix stamp duty. However, when compiling them into a book, stamp duty of 20 cents should still be affixed according to the example of loose-leaf ledgers. If factory staff use this voucher to receive their salary, then the recipient should affix stamp duty according to the example of silver receipt. When compiling them into a book, there is no need to affix stamp duty again on the cover of the book according to the book example. As for this voucher, if it is given to people outside the factory to receive money, it belongs to the nature of the vouchers for withdrawing silver and money in item 4 of the tax rate table. The company should affix stamp duty according to law before delivery. When the recipient signs for receipt on the voucher, there is no need to affix stamp duty again. However, if the receipt is over 100 yuan, stamp duty of 1 cent should still be affixed by the recipient according to the provisions of the last paragraph of Article 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, which states that if the tax rates are different, the higher tax rate should be used. When compiling them into a book, there is no need to process them according to the book example again. This is for your compliance."</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Reorganization Public Debt Certificates, Decided to be Printed by Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Printing costs require 20,000 yuan, delivery limited to before September</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government submitted to the Central Government for approval the issuance of 60 million yuan of Reorganization Public Debt, and its regulations had already passed the Legislative Yuan. However, the debt certificate has not yet been printed. Currently, the public debt is divided into four categories. In addition to repaying old public debt treasury bonds, the remaining balance will be used for political expenses and construction relief. In fact, there is no room for further delay. Therefore, after the Director of Finance, Cheng Yuanfan, invited bids from merchants, it has been learned that the provincial government committee has approved the decision to have the Commercial Press in this city print the certificates. The printing cost requires 20,000 yuan, and a portion of the deposit will be paid first. The deadline for printing and delivering all the debt certificate is the end of September to start the exchange of old debts on time.</p>
<h3>Deputy Chairman of Local Association, Qian Xinzhi Declines to Take Office</h3>
<p>At the fourth annual meeting of the Local Association of this city, Yan Fang, Chen Guangfu, Lin Kanghou, Hu Yunzhi, Feng Bingnan, and others were re-elected as directors. Du Yuesheng was re-elected as Chairman, and Qian Xinzhi and Wang Xiaoji were re-elected as Vice Chairmen. It has been learned that Vice Chairman Qian Xinzhi has submitted his resignation to the association due to the complexity of his public and private affairs and his poor health. However, the association unanimously retained Qian because Qian has made many contributions to the association in the past, hoping that he would withdraw his resignation and continue to serve the society.</p>
<h3>French Police Department Organizes Registration for Applying for Vegetable Market Stall Licenses</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department has set the period for applying for the vegetable market (Xiaodongmen Vegetable Market) stall license registration from the 24th of this month, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. daily at the Xiaodongmen Police Station. When applying for registration, applicants must have a business license or donation ticket to prove their true experience. Only merchants residing in the French Concession will have the priority of registering first.</p>
<h3>Tibet Road Decided to be Renamed Yu Qiaqing Road, Passed by the Municipal Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent Ningbo merchant in Shanghai, assists the Party and the country, leads the masses, is respected by Chinese and foreigners, and has made contributions to society. July of this year marks the 55th anniversary of his stay in Shanghai. Initiated by the Citizens' Federation and other organizations, the Municipal Council was requested to specially name a road after Yu Qiaqing to commemorate him and to remember his contributions. The Public Concession Municipal Council believes that Yu has assisted the concession in its construction for decades, solved problems, and made meritorious contributions. After joining the council as a director, they have relied on him more deeply. At the previous meeting, after a proposal by Director Arnold, the request from the citizens was deemed appropriate, and the Municipal Council expressed its deep sympathy. It has been learned that the Board of Directors decided yesterday to rename Tibet Road, the widest road in the central area of the Public Concession, as Yu Qiaqing Road to express their admiration. It will be implemented soon. It is said that there has never been a Chinese name for a road in the Public Concession. This is an innovation and is considered a very solemn event. Yu Qiaqing has high moral character, is old, and has made contributions to the locality. He is truly deserving of it. At that time, there will be a grand ceremony.</p>

<h3>Japanese Man Carrying Narcotics Seized at North Station</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:20, the police officers stationed at the North Railway Station, together with personnel from the Jianghai Customs, seized four kilograms and four hundred and ten grams of heroin on platforms 7 and 8, arresting a Japanese man named Ikeda Susumu. Because the case involved a foreigner carrying powerful narcotics, the Japanese Consulate was notified to send police officers to bring the Japanese man back for questioning.</p>
<h3>Pudong Association's Fundraising Assembly, First Progress Report</h3>
<p>Total of over 10,000 yuan received</p>
<p>Since the Pudong Association's new clubhouse was completed and the commemorative fundraising assembly began soliciting donations, the 20th of this month was the date for the first progress report. The total achievements of the team leaders and officers amounted to over 10,000 yuan, which is one-third of the standard amount. Those who have pledged but not yet paid are not included, and there are still many who have not pledged. Given the large number of fellow Pudong natives in Shanghai and the enthusiasm of the officers in fundraising, the enthusiasm of the fellow natives in donating will surely yield great results in the future.</p>
<h3>Bullets Found Under Floorboards</h3>
<p>Zhou Jicheng, a local resident, 31 years old, residing at No. 143 Shijia Lane, Nanshi, purchased several loads of watermelon at noon yesterday and planned to place them under the stairs. Due to years of disrepair, the floorboards were rotten. A wooden box for storage was found inside. When opened, it was found to contain 220 rounds of 7.9mm rifle bullets (already moldy). He reported himself to the Dongjiadu Police Station, claiming that he moved in to reside in April of last year. Three years ago, the front building was rented by Cheng Yongmei. In addition to submitting the bullets to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for inspection, the police chief has dispatched police officers to conduct a detailed investigation into the source of the bullets.</p>
<h3>Another Car Stolen</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department received a report from the car owner at around 5 p.m. yesterday, stating that a car with city license No. 9881 and concession license No. 1570 was stolen by bandits in the area. All district police stations were ordered to quickly investigate and arrest the culprits, and the Chinese and French police authorities were notified to assist in the arrest.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit for Alimony: One-Sided Hearing Concluded</h3>
<p>Shen Huating, a Ningbo native currently working as a comprador for the Kuaili steamboat of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Yangtze River, had an affair with Hu Lianfen, a woman from Changzhou (28 years old this year and working as an actress). They lived together for seven or eight years. By the spring of last year, their relationship soured, and on March 21st, they agreed to end their cohabitation. Shen gave Hu $1,000, paying $400 in cash and issuing two checks for $300 each, promising to pay off the checks by the end of last year. When Hu Lianfen presented the checks to Shen for payment at the due date, Shen only paid $50, still owing $550, which he has delayed until now without paying a single cent. Hu, believing that Shen was intentionally delaying payment and attempting to evade his debt, hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting Shen Huating to settle the debt through mediation. As mediation failed, a formal lawsuit was filed. Yesterday morning, Judge Tu Shenjie of the Second Special Court presided over the hearing in Civil Chamber Seven. The plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared in court, recounting the circumstances of the debt and requesting the court to order the defendant to repay the debt. The defendant, Shen Huating, did not appear. At the plaintiff's request, the court allowed a one-sided hearing and then announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the judgment to be pronounced on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<h3>Two Involved in Adultery: Police File Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>Guo Xuefa, a 25-year-old native of Zhenjiang residing at 44 Rue Eugène Bard, and working as a barber, colluded with a woman named Yang Qiusi on the evening of the 20th of last month at 11 PM, to lure Lan Ying, an 18-year-old girl from Yangzhou residing at 486 East Hanbury Road, to secluded rooms in the Jiaotong Hotel at 36 Rue Eugène Bard and the Huning Hotel at 239 Rue Kérouanne. Together with a man named Xiao Gu, who is still at large, they took turns raping her. Later, they hid her in a pavilion on the third floor of 328 Route Massenet, threatening her to prevent her from returning home. The girl seized an opportunity to escape home the other day, informing her father of the situation. The Huishan Police Station dispatched Chinese Detective Liu Decheng, who arrested Guo Xuefa and Yang Qiusi and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Chamber of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department explained the situation and filed a public prosecution based on Article 241, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of disrupting marriage and family. Following this, the girl, Li Lan Ying, testified to the events. When questioned, both defendants offered evasive statements. Judge Zhong Qing ordered them to be remanded to custody separately, postponing the hearing to investigate further.</p>
<h3>Mason Falls: Suffers Severe Injuries All Over</h3>

<h3>Public Works Department Health Authorities Discuss: Summer Heat Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>Recently, this city has been hit by a heat wave, making the intense heat unbearable. Even sitting still indoors is difficult to breathe, and those walking in the scorching sun feel as if they are standing above a furnace. Cases of heatstroke and sudden collapse are common. The Public Health Bureau of the International Settlement has published information on how to combat the heat. Here is a translation of the key points, which we believe the public will find useful.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's weather is often extremely hot in the summer, it is interspersed with occasional storms. Therefore, residents do not consider heat prevention methods to be essential. However, in near-tropical regions, everyone knows to study and follow methods of cooling down and seeking relief from the heat. Therefore, knowing some methods of preventing heat during hot days is an important aspect of summer health. There is much debate among doctors regarding sunstroke, heatstroke, and fainting, with no consensus. Some argue that the light rays in sunlight that can cause chemical reactions cannot penetrate the skull or spine. Therefore, what ordinary people call sunstroke does not scientifically exist, and sun hats, back coverings, and other sun protection items are unnecessary. Those who hold this view have medical evidence to support their claims, making it difficult for ordinary people to refute them. However, on the other hand, when a person is exposed to sunlight and suffers localized burns, in addition to local pain, the entire system of the body feels uneasy. Therefore, from the perspective of general public health, even if sunstroke has no basis in science, the invasion of sunlight must be prevented. This can not only prevent irritation of a part of the skin, but also prevent serious illnesses caused by excessive heat in the body.</p>
<p>Sun helmets can be used because they are thick and do not transmit heat. Black glasses are also necessary to protect the eyes. However, Easterners do not need dark crystal glasses as much as Westerners, because Westerners have light-colored retinas that are more susceptible to sunlight. Furthermore, the amount of moisture in the air is closely related to personal comfort. In drier air, sweat evaporates faster, so even if it is hot, it does not feel uncomfortable. Conversely, when the humidity reaches the saturation point, sweat does not evaporate easily, and one immediately feels stuffy. Therefore, one should be especially careful to prevent heatstroke on quiet, windless days or nights in the summer. Furthermore, according to the findings of an expert in India, rapid drops in temperature can also easily lead to heatstroke and sudden collapse. Sleeping well at night can increase physical strength and enhance the ability to resist heat the next day.</p>
<p>Often, when the body is subjected to prolonged heat, the mechanism in the nervous system that manages body heat becomes overwhelmed and unknowingly abandons its resistance work. As a result, the sweating and other mechanisms that maintain a normal body temperature break down. At this time, one feels hot all over but stops sweating, which is a warning sign of heatstroke and should be carefully prevented. However, heatstroke can also be caused by high humidity in the air, which prevents sweat from evaporating. Therefore, in factories, making the air dry and circulating is an urgent task in the summer.</p>
<p>In addition, there are several rules for individuals to follow in the summer to prevent heatstroke, issued by the health authorities of Pittsburgh, USA. Here is an excerpt: (1) Dress in loose, comfortable clothing; (2) Take extra care when moving from hot to cold places; (3) Drink plenty of cold (boiled) water; (4) Do not overeat; (5) Do not eat spoiled or unclean food; (6) Do not get angry; (7) Exercise moderately, but do not overexert yourself; (8) Seek balance in everything; (9) Wear a hat when going out; (10) Conserve physical, mental, and emotional energy. Whether drinking more water is beneficial depends on each individual's constitution. However, the Eastern proverb "Do not drink alcohol before the sun goes down" should be followed in the summer. During the hottest part of the day, muscles should be relaxed, and it is best to lie down in a cool room for a while, which also helps to increase resistance. Therefore, it is very beneficial to extend the lunch break in the summer.</p>
<p>In recent years, experiments in factories have shown that in hot and humid workplaces, workers who sweat profusely due to long hours of work lose salt in their bodies. Adding a small amount of salt to the drinking water can compensate for this. It is said that after adopting this method, workers feel much less sensitive to the heat. However, we must know that one person's food may be another person's poison. Whether adding salt to water is beneficial or harmful depends on the individual's constitution and may not be suitable for general use. Regarding clothing, summer is most difficult for men, as men's clothing, such as collars, belts, and sleeves, restrict them. Abandoning these restrictions is not yet the time, but the collar of the shirt should be chosen to be larger in size to make it comfortable and allow air to circulate. As for how clothing should be improved, that is another question.</p>
<p>The most enviable people in summer are women. Light silk and gauze are unnecessary to mention, but even a gauze dress is much better than men's clothing. Moreover, women stay indoors and are free to relax, unlike men who have to work for a living, and they can let the scorching sun bake them.</p>

<p>Le Agui, a Ningbo native who runs a laundry business, married Le Wu, a 20-year-old woman from the same town. They reside at No. 98 Route Pincelli in the French Concession. Due to his profession, he leaves early and returns late every day. Unexpectedly, Wu, being young and restless, has been having an affair with Zhu Yaosheng (34 years old), a man from Changzhou who sells cold noodles. Zhu often takes advantage of Le's absence to visit Wu's home for secret rendezvous, not even avoiding other people. Recently, Le learned about this, but lacking solid evidence, he endured it and kept a close watch. At 2 PM on the 21st, Zhu went to Wu's house again to continue their affair. Le happened to return home and caught Zhu and his wife Wu naked in bed. Le immediately turned around, locked the door from the outside, and reported it to Constable No. 606, who arrived and ordered Zhu and Wu to get dressed and took them to the police station. The defendants admitted to having illicit sexual relations in the Kader Hotel two or three times a month ago. Zhu confessed that he sold cold noodles in front of No. 598 Weihaiwei Road and had an affair with Wu. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Chamber of the Second Special Court. The lawyer for the police department requested a postponement for further investigation. Detective Cai Zongyi, who handled the case, also reported the details of the case. After Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned the defendants, he ordered a postponement of the hearing until the morning of the 29th. The defendants were released on a bail of $20 each, or detained if they could not provide bail.</p>
<h3>Cholera Prevention Office Announces: Cholera Prevention Steps</h3>
<p>Living Conditions Are Very Important</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cholera Prevention Temporary Office announced yesterday the cholera prevention steps, saying that clean water supply, vaccination, food management, fly eradication, and personal hygiene are important for cholera prevention, but housing problems are also very important and should not be ignored. Poor people, without sanitation facilities, cannot understand the ways to health, and they still use dirty water from ditches for washing rice, vegetables, and utensils. In order to improve this kind of environment, the municipal government has built four model civilian villages in the city in the past three years. Each village has a square for citizens to rest. The rents of the houses are very cheap, ranging from 3 to 4 yuan, and most of them are rented to the working class. The locations of the civilian villages are Zhongshan Road, Pushan Road, Qimei Road, and Damuqiao Road. Compared with the needs of Shanghai citizens, this number is a small beginning.</p>
<h3>Use Alcohol With Caution</h3>
<p>Four People Have Died in the Last Two Weeks: Public Works Department Issues Warning</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's factory division recently issued a serious warning to all factories, large and small, that use alcohol. According to the division's report, in the past three weeks, there have been multiple explosions in factories in the International Settlement due to improper or negligent use of alcohol, resulting in the deaths of four workers and serious injuries to two others. One explosion occurred when welding a crack in a broken iron drum. The second explosion occurred when a burning cotton swab was carelessly thrown onto an alcohol can. Although the can had a lid, there were two small holes that leaked air. Another explosion occurred when pouring alcohol onto a fire. As for the fourth explosion, the circumstances surrounding the incident are unknown because two officials have died. What is known is that the explosion must have had a source of ignition, and alcohol vapor is extremely explosive. Factory owners must take precautions. Therefore, no matter how alcohol is used, attention should be paid at all times and in all places. Even empty cans that have contained alcohol should not be placed anywhere. When not in use, it is best to wash them clean with water and store them in one place to prevent residual alcohol from vaporizing and causing accidents. Sources of ignition should not be allowed near places where alcohol is stored. Extreme caution should be taken when welding broken cans or opening new cans. This applies not only to alcohol but also to sulfuric acid, alcohol, ether, and other dangerous substances. In recent years, there have been several major accidents caused by using blowtorches to open cans. Factory owners should provide guidance to workers at all times to teach them how to prevent various dangers.</p>
<h3>Jealousy and Adultery Lead to Poisoning and Over Twenty Knife Wounds: Mistress Bleeds Profusely, Luo Tao Screams in Pain, Xia Guiting Sent to Officials for Investigation</h3>
<p>Xia Guiting, a 40-year-old native of Henan, who makes a living as a barber, had an affair with Luo Tao, a 30-year-old woman who works as a maid. The night before, the two met and went to the Xin Chun Hotel at No. 391 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, renting a room to have illicit sexual relations. Xia, knowing that Luo had recently found a new lover and that her affection for him was gradually waning, felt displeased. He tried to persuade her to end her relationship with the new lover. However, Luo, infatuated and unrepentant, not only refused to listen to Xia's advice but also blamed him for meddling, which angered Xia. Unable to vent his anger, Xia took a razor knife at around 2 AM, while Luo was sound asleep, and stabbed her all over her body more than twenty times, creating wounds of varying depths. Blood flowed all over the bed and the floor. Luo woke up in pain, screaming loudly. The tea servant heard the screams and reported it to the Grand Clock Tower Police Station, which dispatched Detectives Jin Bingwen and Liu Deyi to the scene. They arrested Xia and took him into custody. Luo Tao, who was injured, was sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. At noon, the police escorted Xia to the First Criminal Chamber of the Second Special Court. Police Department lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case, stating that the Police Department still needed to investigate and that the victim was receiving treatment in the hospital and had not yet arrived. He requested a postponement for further questioning. After Judge Chen Shuoying questioned Xia, he ordered a postponement to allow the victim to recover from her injuries and to conduct further investigation. The defendant was remanded to custody.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Association Sends Letter to Public Works Department: Postpone Slum Demolition</h3>
<p>Construct Low-Income Housing in Stages: To Accommodate and Avoid Provoking Incidents</p>
<p>The slum dwellers in the eastern and western districts of Shanghai are extremely worried due to the authorities' deadline for demolition. They have been appealing to all parties in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, slum representatives, including Wang Qitai, submitted another letter to the First Special District Citizens' Association, pleading their grievances. The association agreed to send another letter to the Public Works Department to negotiate a postponement of the demolition. The letter from the Shanghai Municipal Association to the Public Works Department reads, "Regarding the deadline for slum demolition, this association previously heard that your bureau agreed to handle it flexibly. Therefore, we sent a letter to your bureau expressing our delight and suggesting that to fundamentally solve the slum problem, funds should be allocated to construct low-income housing in stages to gradually restrict slums. We hope you will consider this. We have now received a tearful appeal from slum representatives, including Wang Qitai, learning that your bureau has not agreed to postpone the slum demolition. Therefore, thousands of slum dwellers, despite appeals from all parties, will inevitably suffer the pain of displacement. We believe that during this time of economic depression and hardship for the citizens, especially for the slum class, for the sake of showing compassion for the laborers and maintaining public order, we request that you consider the opinions in our previous letter, approve the postponement of the demolition, and construct low-income housing in stages to accommodate them and avoid provoking incidents. We sincerely pray for this."</p>

<h3>Lu Bohong: Establishes Large Nursery</h3>
<p>Can Accommodate 4,000 Infants: Site Under Construction in Longhua</p>
<p>There are many nurseries in this city that specialize in accepting poor infants. However, due to a lack of funding, the management is not good. For example, there is not enough milk for the infants, and some wet nurses are supplying four or five children. Sanitary facilities are also lacking, resulting in rampant infant diseases. The Chinese Infant Welfare Association, recognizing this, decided to plan for improvement. It is learned that philanthropist Lu Bohong is now establishing a large nursery. The funds for the nursery have been donated by a philanthropist for 100,000 yuan as start-up costs. The site has been selected in Longhua and is currently under construction. After the establishment of the nursery, it can accommodate 4,000 infants, making it the only great nursery in our country.

The case was heard by Judge Wu Zongxing the other day. Wang Huizhen testified that she is fifteen years old, born in the year of the dog, on the fifth day of the sixth lunar month. She is from Shanghai and lives at No. 109, Hujia Mu Bridge. Xu Yaozeng is her neighbor. On June 1st of this year, while she was</p>
<p>Leisurely Gazing at the Door</p>
<p>A young girl named丫頭 (丫頭) came and called her, saying that another young girl was calling her to go and play. She followed her. The official asked, "Did you mention which young girl?" She replied, "I didn't ask her." Asked, "Where did you follow her to?" She replied, "To the bottom of the Jiaxing Road Bridge." Then he tricked her to go to Yuezhou Road. When they arrived there, she saw Xu Yaozeng in front of the hotel. It was 11 o'clock at night. She went inside and did not see the young girl. She wanted to go home immediately, but they would not let her go. They opened room number nine, and the name written in the register was Zhang Yang. Asked, "Were there only the two of you in the hotel?" She replied, "丫頭 (丫頭) waited for an hour or two and then left. I wanted to leave, but Xu would not allow it. Then</p>
<p>A Relationship Occurred</p>
<p>Asked, "Was that the first time you had a relationship with someone?" She replied, "Yes." Asked, "How many nights did you stay with him?" She replied, "Three nights, but I was raped twice." Asked, "Have you had a relationship with anyone else?" She replied, "No." Asked, "You went in on June 1st, when did you come out?" She replied, "At 2 pm on the 4th. Xu's friend and others said they would send me back, but they circled around a few times and hid me in room 14 of the Shangyuan Hotel on Dixiwei Road. The next day, they changed to room 13. The name reported in the register was Wang." Asked, "Was there anyone wearing a suit when the room was opened?" She replied, "Yes, about thirty years old." Asked, "Did you sleep with him in the Shangyuan Hotel?" She replied, "No." On the fourth day, he was already</p>
<p>Found By My Mother</p>
<p>Therefore, he asked his friend surnamed Wang to watch over me. Asked, "When did your mother take you out?" She replied, "It was on the evening of the 6th, and a person surnamed Jiang, also a friend of Xu's, came to take me out with her." Asked, "Did you tell your mother about this at the time?" She replied, "I didn't dare to say it at the time, and only told her after being forced to," and so on. At this point, the official asked her mother, Wang Lu, who stated that she is forty-six years old, from Shanghai, and her husband is a bathhouse manager. Wang Huizhen is her only daughter, fifteen years old, and also has an elder daughter named Aizhen, seventeen years old. Asked, "Has your daughter always been well-behaved?" She replied,</p>
<p>Always Well-behaved</p>
<p>She rarely goes out. Xu Yaozeng is her neighbor, so she recognizes him. Asked, "Did Xu have any relationship with your daughter before?" She replied, "I don't know, but after my daughter went missing on June 1st, I heard people say that Xu took her." On June 4th, she met Xu and asked him to come in and asked him properly. He went with her to search, but she didn't find her until June 6th. Asked, "When did you go to the Public Security Bureau?" She replied, "It was on the 9th that I reported it." Asked, "You didn't</p>
<p>Accuse Him of Rape</p>
<p>Only accused him of abducting your daughter?" She replied, "Yes, because I heard people say that he was watching a show with my daughter, and I didn't know there was this inside story, so I didn't accuse him of rape," and so on. At this point, the official asked Xu Yaozeng, who stated that he is twenty-one years old, from Shanghai, and works in the rice industry. He lives at No. 191, Xiangyanqiao Road, Hujia Mu Bridge. He and Wang Huizhen have been neighbors for ten years. They moved away a year ago. Asked, "On June 1st of this year, at 8 pm, did you ask a person named丫頭 (丫頭) to call Wang Huizhen to open a room?" He replied, "No. On June 4th, I was passing by his house, and they</p>
<p>Privately Detained Me</p>
<p>And reported to the police, who sent me to the court, and later I was not prosecuted." Asked, "Where was Wang Huizhen found?" He replied, "Her mother and I found her in the Shangyuan Hotel." Asked, "Have you opened a room with her?" He replied, "I was really framed by being mistaken for someone else. I heard that her neighbor said that she went to open a room with someone surnamed Wang. I am really wronged." Asked, "If there is no relationship, why do you accuse him?" He replied, "Because the prosecutor did not prosecute, they wanted to extort money, and I did not agree, so they fabricated an accusation against me." At this point, the official asked Wang Huizhen again, "How many physical relationships have you had with Xu?" She replied, "Only twice." Asked, "The last</p>
<p>Forensic Examination of You</p>
<p>Said that you had sexual intercourse more than twice." She replied, "Only twice." The official then ordered that Wang Huizhen be re-examined today. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately claimed on behalf of Huizhen that Wang Huizhen was having her period today and it was inconvenient to examine her. The official then ordered a change of date for the re-examination and another hearing. The defendant was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Shen Baorong - Abduction of Cousin</h3>
<p>Four-Year-Old Girl Found - Wu Wang Suspected</p>
<p>Yin Shen, a local young woman (30 years old), went to Hangzhou with her husband for work two years ago. A week ago, she brought two girls to her mother's place in Shanghai for summer vacation, residing upstairs at No. 172, Wangjia Wharf in the South City. Shen Baorong, her cousin (21 years old), who is usually unemployed and wanders around, suddenly came to her mother's place to play at about 1 pm on the 17th. While Shen was in the room pouring tea, Shen and her four-year-old daughter, Gendi, disappeared at the same time. Shen did not suspect anything at first, but when they did not return home in the evening, Shen became suspicious. She went to her uncle's house to inquire, and he replied that he had not returned for several days. In alarm, she searched everywhere. At 2 pm yesterday, she passed by the entrance of Shijia Lane and saw Shen playing there. She immediately grabbed Shen and ordered him to hand over the girl Gendi. A nearby patrol officer took him to the police station. According to his confession, when he took her to the Fu'an Company to play, he met Liang Zhu and others, who wanted to extort 20 yuan without success. He was forced to go to room 14 of the Aiquan Hotel on North Zhejiang Road and sent the child to the home of Wu Wang at No. 55, Ning'anfang, Zhabei. According to her account, she immediately dispatched police to arrest Wu Wang, who confessed, "The girl is currently living in my house, and I don't know anything else." After the police station verified the confession, the case was referred to the General Bureau for investigation and prosecution on the grounds of alleged enticement and suspicion of collusion by Wu Wang.</p>
<h3>Resisting Coffee and Cocoa</h3>
<p>Tea Powder</p>
<p>Tea, as a beverage, is a major export of our country. In recent times, not only has the export volume of tea decreased sharply, but the import of beverages such as coffee and cocoa has increased daily, which is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Zhuang Wanfang and Dong Yiyun, in view of this, have jointly researched and produced a tea powder to replace coffee and cocoa. The fine powder is very similar to cocoa, and the granular powder is like coffee. It is said that the ingredients are similar to tea, but better than coffee. However, the aroma is not as strong as coffee and still needs to be improved. The fine powder is more suitable for manufacturing candy, ice cream, and milk blending raw materials. As for the equipment for manufacturing tea powder, it is still under research and design. It is also heard that in the future, this product will be sold exclusively by the most famous tea house, Wang Yutai.</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Association News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Private Radio Broadcasting Industry Association, located at No. 323 Jiangxi Road, was previously ordered by the Telegraph Bureau to inform all broadcasters to submit their manuscripts to the Association for submission to the Telegraph Bureau for review in order to review broadcasting scripts. Now, because a small number of broadcasters directly submit them to the Telegraph Bureau, the Broadcasting Association has no way to verify them and will not be able to notify the member stations to comply. Therefore, a representative was sent to contact Shen Yide of the relevant department of the Telegraph Bureau, who has agreed to order all broadcasters to write four copies of the manuscripts, whether they are submitted to the Telegraph Bureau or the Association, so that one copy can be stored in the Association for verification. The total time for the ten restricted programs is three hours, except for the period from 7 pm to 10 pm every day. The previous report stated that the time was from 6 pm to 10 pm and the total amount was two hours, which was a misunderstanding. As for the rumor that a certain group in the ten restricted programs had asked the Association to forward a request to the Telegraph Bureau to cancel the restriction, the person in charge of the member station said that no group had contacted the Association, so he did not know about it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Consolidated Tax Inspection Office - Seized Cigarette Hand-Crank Iron Machines</h3>
<p>Director Qian of the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions recently learned that private cigarettes were rampant in areas such as Yannan, Henan, Xuchang, and Xinyang. The hand-crank iron machines used were mostly smuggled by Shanghai merchants. Therefore, he secretly ordered the Shanghai Inspection Office to instruct all branch offices and patrol boats to strictly investigate. Cai Guanglu, the director of the Beishi Branch Office, after receiving the order, learned that merchants often smuggled iron machines through the North Station. In the 24th year, as many as eight units had been seized. Recently, because the station inspection was strict, it was not easy to slip through the net. The merchants disassembled the hand-crank machines into parts, packed them into postal packages, and sent them to those areas through the post office in the concession. As for machine parts, such as iron legs, they were transported by ships. In addition to reporting the investigation to the higher authorities, the Office also supervised the inspectors to step up the arrest. Yesterday morning, the branch office received a tip from an informant that Yongli Iron Factory had disassembled a hand-crank iron machine, mixed it with scrap iron, packed it into four bamboo baskets, and handed it over to Jielu Huitong Transportation Company, falsely claiming it was scrap iron, and entrusted the Road Bureau to transport it to Yancheng. According to the report, the Office immediately went with the informant and detained all four bamboo baskets. Together with Luo Guisheng, a reporting clerk of Huitong Company, they were taken to the Office. The bamboo baskets were opened, and the scrap iron was removed. Each basket contained new hand-crank iron machine parts at the bottom. They were assembled into a complete hand-crank iron machine on the spot. It was reported to the Shanghai Inspection Office for verification on the same day. According to the report, the Office immediately forwarded it to the Consolidated Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to be dealt with severely according to law, in order to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Cai Huaiqing, an accountant from Ningbo, currently thirty years old, who works for Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, located at No. 800 Beijing Road, has been working for the company for more than two years. Recently, Cai embezzled more than 8,000 yuan of company funds and could not make up for it. Therefore, he ran away on April 16th of this year and disappeared without a trace. The company's general manager, Zhou Xiangsheng, sued Cai Huaisan (that is, Huaiqing's brother), Cai's guarantor, in the local court. It was not until the day before yesterday that Huaisan accompanied Cai Huaiqing to Xiang Sheng Company to surrender and reported it to the Lao Zha Criminal Station, which ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Cai Huaiqing and detain him in the station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the station, prosecuted him for the crime of embezzlement in violation of Article 336, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, and stated the circumstances of the case, saying that on May 19th of this year, Zhang Kaixun, a representative of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, reported to the station that the accountant Cai Huaiqing had run away on April 16th and had not returned. The company authorities suspected Cai's departure, and immediately started an investigation, only to find out that Cai had fraudulent accounts. As for the exact amount of fraud, because General Manager Zhou Xiangsheng happened to be away from Shanghai on business, it was not possible to ascertain it for a while. The station then sent detectives to inquire at the defendant's residence at No. 122 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. His wife, Cai Hong, said that her husband had not returned for many days, so there was no result. Meanwhile, the company pursued the guarantor Cai Huaisan. It was not until this month that Manager Zhou returned to Shanghai and found out that the defendant entered Xiang Sheng Automobile Company as an accountant in January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, specializing in managing the daily payments from various branches and customers' deposits and transferring them to the bank. Because the procedures were complicated, another person was assigned to help the defendant cooperate in April of this year. However, the defendant knew that he had used the accounts privately and could not hide it, so he had to run away. It was found that the defendant's method of fraud was to privately cancel the deposit of 10,000 yuan under the name of Mei and treat it as if it had been withdrawn. There were also more than 4,000 yuan of business payments from various branches, but the defendant only deposited 30,000 yuan into the bank. The two frauds totaled more than 11,000 yuan. After deducting more than 2,000 yuan that the defendant had already returned to the driver as a guarantee deposit, the actual amount of embezzlement was 8,540 yuan, etc. When questioned, the defendant Cai Huaiqing admitted that he had used the accounts privately for 8,540 yuan. After Judge Feng Shide verified the confession, he ruled that the defendant would be detained for another seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case in Jiashan - A Minor Leader Arrested in Shanghai - Second Special Court Ruled to Transfer to Zhejiang Water Police</h3>
<p>Cai Axiao, son of Cai Fuqing, a farmer from Xiajiadian Village, Dingshan Town, Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, Li Erguan, son of Li Wenxuan, a farmer from Dadongwang Village in the same county, and Li Zhang, daughter-in-law of Li Wenyuan from the same village, were abducted by bandits on the evening of April 13th of this year, and ransoms were demanded. Later, the family members raised one or two hundred yuan each to redeem the hostages. After the incident, the competent police authorities ordered the arrest of the kidnappers. Li Jinlin, a detective from the First Brigade of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police, purchased a line and found out that Zhang Azhang, a minor leader of the kidnappers from Qingpu, 35 years old, was hiding at No. 96 Dushenfu Road in the French Concession. He came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and reported to the French Police Station, requesting assistance in the arrest. According to the report, the police chief immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to go to the address secretly and arrested the kidnapper Zhang Azhang. They found a leather wallet with 15 pawn tickets in his possession and brought him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Chen Shuoyang interrogated him. Yuan Jiahe, a lawyer from the police department, clarified the case and did not object to the Zhejiang Water Police Department's request for extradition. Then, Li Jinlin, a detective from the First Brigade of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police, submitted an official document requesting permission to extradite the defendant for interrogation. When questioned, the defendant denied participating in the kidnapping case. After verifying the confession in court, it was ruled that the defendant Zhang Azhang would be handed over to the incoming personnel for interrogation and handling.</p>
<h3>The Changjiang Piece Goods Gang - Stopped Loading for Export</h3>
<p>Started loading Chinese merchant ships yesterday - First batch of goods shipped out by Hongyuan</p>
<p>The amount of piece goods and cotton yarn shipped from Shanghai to various ports along the Yangtze River every year is huge. The main destinations are Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, Chongqing, and various places in Hunan. These piece goods and cotton yarn are mostly loaded onto ships of the Six Companies. Since July 1st, the Six Companies decided to implement a measure to measure the size of the piece goods and charge according to the newly set freight rates, which aroused the opposition of the piece goods customers and customs brokers in Shanghai, who refused to load the goods. It was not until the 9th that Chen Panjun, chairman of the Customs Brokers Association, repeatedly consulted with Shen Zhongyi, Wu Delin, Li Zhiyi of Sanbei, and Zeng Guangqing of China Merchants, that the extension of half a month was granted, and it was promised to appropriately reduce the freight rates and relax the size standards, and the accumulated goods that were obstructed were loaded first. On the 14th, Chen Panjun, in the name of representatives of customs brokers and customers, sent a letter to Taikoo Company, requesting that from July 15th, the size of the piece goods shipped to the Yangtze River should be based on 30 cubic feet per piece, as was the case for shipments to Chongqing. If the box exceeds 30 feet, the freight can be charged according to the set freight rate. Those shipped before July 15th will still be calculated at the original rate of 5 yuan and 7 jiao and a half for each 30 feet. After July 15th, each piece will still be 30 feet, and the freight rate may be increased to 7 yuan and a half. Taikoo Company did not clearly respond to this letter, and still insisted on calculating according to the size of 18 feet per piece (13 yuan and 6 jiao for 40 feet) set by the Six Companies, so a 30-foot box would have to be charged 10 yuan and 2 jiao for freight. As a result, both parties could not agree. In the past ten days or so, various parties have been mediating, but to no avail. Foreign shipping companies believe that the Six Companies have already made a decision and must implement the proposal. However, if there is room for accommodation, they ask the customs brokers and customers to load the goods as usual for the time being, and the size should be measured according to the new regulations, and the calculation of the freight should be left to the final decision. The customers were not satisfied with this proposal, because once the size and price were stated on the bill of lading, it would be difficult to recover in the future. Not only would the loss be huge, but it would be tantamount to implicitly recognizing the new regulations. The customers and customs brokers changed their plans and resolutely refused to load foreign ships. They sent representatives and pushed Chen Panjun and Ning Shao of Sanbei and China Merchants to negotiate with the three companies. From today onwards, the Yangtze River piece goods gang in Shanghai voluntarily refused to load all the goods onto foreign ships and completely switched to Chinese ships. However, they requested that the freight rate for the piece goods shipped before the Six Companies had fairly relaxed the size and reduced the fees would not be determined for the time being, and would be calculated when the solution was resolved in the future. The freight can be paid in advance, but the amount is not disclosed. At the same time, they also requested Sanbei and China Merchants to each release Shanghai-Hunan special liners every week, specifically for carrying Hunan piece goods. Sanbei has already complied and telegraphed Hongyuan, Hongheng, Hongli, and Hongzhen. Four ships will come to Shanghai and sail directly to Weisha, with one ship going to Hunan every Tuesday and Friday. China Merchants Bureau also dispatched Jiangda and Jiangjing. Two ships will sail to Changsha specifically. After the two issues were resolved, the customers automatically refused to transport the Yangtze River piece goods on foreign ships, starting yesterday. The first batch of piece goods, which were specially loaded on Chinese ships to the Yangtze River, was transported by the Sanbei Hongyuan轮船 (轮船) ship, which was exported yesterday, with a total of 400 to 500 pieces, worth about 130,000 to 40,000 yuan. This was to Hunan. Tomorrow, the China Merchants Bureau Jiangshun ship will also have a large batch of piece goods transported to Jiujiang, Hankou, and other ports. There are more than ten customs brokers in Shanghai who operate piece goods, including Xinchanglong, Xinchangyuan, Fuhe, Huiji, Luyanggong, Ruiji, and Yongan. When a reporter from this newspaper asked Chen Panjun, chairman of the Customs Brokers Association, how many pieces of piece goods (including Changsha) are shipped to the Yangtze River from Shanghai every year, Chen Jun said that although there are contractions from time to time due to market conditions, on average, there are at least 82,000 to 90,000 pieces per year. Calculated at an average price of 350 yuan per piece, the total amount should be more than 30 million yuan. If the average freight rate is 7 yuan per piece, then the annual amount is more than 600,000 yuan, which is an alarming number.</p>
<h3>Senji and Other Companies Empty Jiawang Company</h3>
<p>Municipal Social Bureau Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>Jia Zai &amp; Mining Co., Ltd., located at No. 31, Fuyi Lane, Shengping Street, Foch Road, British Concession, recently convened an extraordinary meeting of shareholders in the name of the board of directors, and published advertisements in various newspapers. Shareholders Senji and others stated that the company had been organized for a long time, but had never convened a regular meeting of shareholders over the years, nor had it notified the shareholders of the business conditions. They were very isolated from the actual situation of the company. Therefore, they went to the company's general office to inquire about everything, but did not get any results. They also failed to prepare the company's articles of association, minutes of shareholders' meetings, annual settlement statements, etc., in accordance with the law. The shareholders believed that whether the company had been registered and how the board of directors was formed concerned the rights and interests of the shareholders, so they immediately requested the Municipal Social Bureau to thoroughly investigate. After receiving the request, the Bureau dispatched personnel to investigate and ordered the shareholders to be informed.</p>
<h3>This City's Anti-Smuggling Association Sets Up a Secret Reporting Office</h3>
<p>Announcing to All Sectors to Report Violations</p>
<p>The Anti-Smuggling Association of All Sectors in this City held its second executive meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon and decided to set up a secret reporting office and announce to all sectors to reward secret reports in order to warn unscrupulous merchants. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Executive Meeting</p>
<p>The Association held its second executive meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2 pm yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Cao Zhigong, Liu Zhongying, Zhang Yichen, Qu Zhenhua, Zhou Xuexiang, Zhang Xiaotong, (Yu Dai), Yu Yaoqiu, and Wang Manyun. Cao Zhigong presided over the meeting, and Zhu Yutao recorded it. After the formalities, the chairman first reported that the original plan was for Yu Qiaqing, Wang Jian, and other five committee members to visit Cai Kong to ask for instructions on the anti-smuggling policy, but because Yu and Wang were both away from Shanghai on business, it was decided to postpone the visit. After the report was completed, the following cases were discussed: (1) Announce to all sectors and solicit secret reports. It was decided to hand over the draft announcement to the Secretariat. (2) Send a letter to various groups and the Citizen Federations of the two special districts, ordering their subordinates to cooperate in the arrest. It was decided to pass it. (3) Set up a secret reporting box. It was decided to temporarily set up a temporary office of the Association. (4) Appoint a person in charge of secret reporting affairs. It was decided to appoint Cao Zhigong, Zhang Yichen, and Qu Zhenhua to be responsible with the Information Section. (5) Determine the temporary office of the Association. It was decided to set it up in the Citizen Federation of the First Special District, Tianhou Palace Bridge. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Announcement to All Sectors</p>
<p>For the sake of announcement, since the occurrence of smuggling incidents in North China, it has become increasingly rampant, obstructing our country's customs from exercising inspection and seizure, resulting in the spread of smuggled goods and the near bankruptcy of national tax revenue. The various groups in this city, in order to assist the government in detecting smuggling and maintaining its lifeline, resolved to establish an anti-smuggling association of all sectors at a joint meeting on August 24th, and elected Wang Xiaoji, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Renzhi (Zhou Xuexiang, etc.) and 35 others as committee members, and has already started working. It is believed that our country's industry and commerce were originally in the budding stage, and this smuggling has made it impossible to maintain. This city is a major port in the southeast and the commercial center of the country. The water and land transportation is also very convenient. If we allow traitors and vagrants to use it as a base for smuggling, the consequences will be unimaginable. After the second executive meeting, it was decided to set up a secret reporting office (the address is temporarily located at the Anti-Smuggling Association of All Sectors in Shanghai, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Tianhou Palace Bridge) in order to arouse the public to assist the government in detecting smuggling and unscrupulous merchants. The Association will advocate in good conscience, do its best to investigate and report to the government, and strictly keep the names of secret reporters confidential. As for the government's measures to reward the public for detecting smuggling, it will also be responsible for handling them. We hope that all citizens will rise up together to save the country from danger. This is a special announcement.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Medical and Political College: Cultivating Health Administration Talent: Completing County Hospitals</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been many reforms in medical administration in Jiangsu Province, such as the establishment of the Huaiyin Jianbi Health Experimental Zones, the preparation for the Nantong Wuxi Health Offices, and the examination of the directors of the county opium suppression centers. The organization of the Provincial Health Education Committee and the Provincial Capital Health Education Committee are also significant events. Because the authorities pay equal attention to health administration and health education, all graduates from the first health administration and health education departments of the Provincial Medical and Political College have been assigned jobs, with demand exceeding supply. It has recently been reported that the Huaiyin Kala-azar prevention team and its branches, which will be established soon, will be staffed by graduates from the first rural medical and pharmaceutical primary service training class graduating from the college this summer. It has also been learned that the authorities intend to complete all county hospitals in the next fiscal year to promote medical facilities. The admission requirements for the second health administration department of the Provincial Medical and Political College this semester are graduates of public or registered private medical schools with specialized training in health administration. The aim is to cultivate basic talent for promoting public health in the province. In the future, staff members for these county hospitals and directors of health offices will be selected from graduates of the health administration department. Among the fifteen graduates from the first health administration department, two are currently directors of health experimental zones, one is a director of a health office, and one is a director of a veterinary disease prevention experimental zone. The rest are either section chiefs or health technicians, all able to use their talents to engage in public health work.</p>

<p>One Year of Sichuan University</p>
<p>(1) (Chengdu Correspondence) National Sichuan University was formed in 1931 from the merger of two universities. Because it is located in the remote southwest, it has not been valued in the past. Since Ren Hongjun took over as president of the university last September, he has spared no effort to reorganize and reform the university. In just two semesters, the university has made significant progress. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect the university last semester and concluded that "since the beginning of this semester, the university has vigorously implemented a full-time professorship system, reorganized the curriculum, improved the administrative organization, and economized on office expenses to focus on expanding facilities. The university has also earnestly implemented training and management matters, and the school's discipline is improving weekly. These achievements are highly commendable." The university's work this semester has progressed even further. It is rumored that the university plans to recruit students in Shanghai, Beijing, and Chongqing this year, which shows its far-reaching plans. Based on my personal observations, I will list the main points below for the reference of those who care about education in the southwest.</p>
<p>The University's Organization</p>
<p>The university originally had only three colleges: Arts, Sciences, and Law. This year, the Provincial Agricultural College was merged into the university, combining them into four colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, and Agriculture. There are more than ten departments, including the Chinese Literature Department, Foreign Literature Department, History Department, and Education Department in the College of Arts; the Mathematics and Physics Department, Chemistry Department, and Biology Department in the College of Sciences; the Law Department and Political Economy Department in the College of Law; and the Agricultural College, which has not been divided into departments this year. It is said that next year, the university plans to establish four departments: Agronomy Department, Horticulture Department, Forestry Department, and Plant Pathology and Entomology Department.</p>
<p>New Campus Construction Plan</p>
<p>The university's old buildings were all dilapidated and unusable. Since Ren Hongjun became president of the university, he has obtained a grant of 1,630,000 yuan from Chairman Jiang for the university's reconstruction and equipment upgrades. In addition to allocating 1,400,000 yuan in Sichuan Post-Disaster Public Bonds and 30,000 yuan from the Sichuan Education Department, the central and Sichuan provincial governments will each contribute 600,000 yuan, which will be allocated evenly over three years starting in the 25th fiscal year. All of this has been reported in various newspapers. It is now heard that the 1,400,000 yuan in Sichuan Post-Disaster Bonds has been paid out in cash by Director Liu of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance at 75% of face value, totaling 1,050,000 yuan. It has also been decided that it will be paid out in four installments starting in May, and the first installment has already been received. The first new building—the library—is scheduled to begin construction this summer. In addition, the university's construction plan is entrusted to domestic architectural experts from the renowned architectural firms Jintai Company and Gongli Business Company, such as Ge Songsheng and Xi Fuquan, to design. All drawings have been completed, and President Ren is currently in Nanjing in May to hire Weng Wenhao, Zhou Yichun, Li Ji, Jiang Tingfu, and other gentlemen with experience in education and architecture to form a review committee to conduct a detailed review. The result is that the three colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Law will be jointly built on the old site of the Imperial City, using the Jintai drawings, while the Agricultural College will remain outside the East Gate, using the Gongli drawings.</p>
<p>Increased Hiring of Prominent Professors</p>
<p>Since the university implemented the full-time professorship system, the number of classes missed this semester has been very small. In addition, the university has hired prominent professors, such as Qian Yunong, Yang Yunkui, Zhang Yizun, Zhu Jianren, Ding Shan, Luo Rongzi, and Yang Qi, to teach in Sichuan and guide students in their research. The academic atmosphere has changed for the better. The university is continuing to hire many more famous professors, such as Zhang Zhenru and Wang Xiaoliang, who will be arriving soon.</p>
<p>Establishment of Scholarships and Loans</p>
<p>Because Sichuan Province has been troubled by years of unrest, the countryside is in decline, and many students with economic difficulties have dropped out of school halfway through, which is very pitiful. In addition to the free tuition policy, the university has established a student loan program this semester, allocating funds from the school's managed funds to be loaned out to help poor students, so as to avoid them dropping out halfway. It is estimated that 63 students have continued their studies this semester thanks to the loans, and the amount loaned out is over 1,100 yuan. It is planned to continue this program in the future so that poor students will not have to worry about dropping out of school due to financial difficulties. In addition, Chen Hengzhe first established the Zhuang Yunkuan Scholarship at the university in memory of his parents and to encourage future generations. The scholarship is 200 yuan per year and is awarded in two installments. This semester, the students who received the scholarship included Wu Tian and five others, all of whom are talented students at the university.</p>
<p>Expansion of Farms and Forests</p>
<p>The Agricultural College was originally the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural College. The affiliated farms and the Guanxian Wuyan Mountain Forest Farm cover an area of over 1,000 mu. In the past, they were abandoned and not managed due to a lack of funds and were leased out, which was very regrettable. Now, since they have been merged into the university, all tenants have been evicted and the land has been reclaimed for active management. In addition, over 300 mu of land have been newly purchased not far from the university outside the East Gate of Chengdu to serve as the college's fruit tree horticulture farm and animal husbandry farm for students' practical training. The university is also actively cooperating with the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction, such as jointly running the rice and wheat testing farm, the Neijiang sugarcane testing farm, and the Sichuan Provincial Technical Soil Training Class. Professors Yang Yunkui, Mao Zongliang, Yang Ligong, and others from the university serve as the heads and deputy heads of these programs, respectively. At the same time, the university is cooperating with the Agricultural College of National Central University and the Central Cotton Improvement Institute to improve the cotton industry. In the future, this will greatly benefit the improvement of agriculture in Sichuan Province. (To be continued)</p>

The HSBC exchange rate listing showed that both British and American rates were flat. Later, although banks engaged in counter-trading, the trend was slightly looser due to weak buying interest and more spread trades. The silver equalization tax was announced with a rise of 0.25. After this, the situation fluctuated, but the market was still unable to rally by noon.

<p>Securities: Government Bonds Remain Robust</p>
<p>The market conditions in the Chinese Securities Exchange were still very stable yesterday. Although the initial auction saw some weakness, it quickly rebounded, with gains even stronger than before. Type A bonds reached their highest price again, and Type B bonds saw new high prices. Although it was a short squeeze, the trend was too tight, and there may be another long position organization. Type A bonds broke through the 70 yuan mark, which may be a sign of trouble. Given the current situation, looking back at yesterday's events, the opening auction showed some weakness, with Types D and E both seeing a slight pullback of 0.2-0.3 yuan. Starting with the forward Type C bonds, No. 54 issued a batch of buying orders, and the trend suddenly changed.

<p>The Merits and Demerits of Chromatic Solutions for Gonorrhea  By Dr. Chen Shaohua　　Since Ehrlich invented the chromatic solution, its effective treatment of gonorrhea has been widely known. However, when preparing for intravenous injection, slight carelessness can greatly reduce its efficacy, which is a common complaint among doctors. Moreover, the quality of the dyes varies greatly, and they should not be used casually without rigorous refinement. Therefore, they are rarely used in oral medications. Later, through research by Sirul, with special chemical disinfection methods, an oral medication for gonorrhea was developed, resulting in remarkable efficacy. Although numerous reports have been made, it is still in the experimental stage. However, since Peter officially created "Clinon," gonorrhea has had a reliable chromatic treatment. This is truly the mother of all gonorrhea drugs. Its effectiveness lies in eliminating inflammation and pain. Only "Clinon" falls within the scope of pure chromatic therapy. Patients should take note of this.　　The therapeutic achievements of "Clinon" are different from those of Chang Le. Once administered, it can achieve a radical cure within a few weeks (in fact, there is no medicine that can completely cure with just one or two bottles. "Clinon" requires about four or five bottles for acute cases and about eight or nine bottles for chronic cases to achieve a radical cure). It does not cause stomach upset or any other irritation. However, when taking it, do not easily believe the deceptions of others. This medicine mainly treats acute urethral gonorrhea in men, chronic prostatitis, orchitis, and various types of gonorrhea and leukorrhea in women. "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" can be used as well. Its therapeutic application range is even broader for joint inflammation in both sexes. Loss of Appetite and Weakened Gastric Function　　Loss of appetite, fullness in the chest, and aversion to food are common summer symptoms. Patients often delay treatment, leading to chronic illnesses. Lack of appetite and reduced food intake result in various stubborn gastric diseases, such as gastric dilation, nervous dyspepsia, and gastric ulcers. This is something we should pay attention to. It is common for people to think that summer loss of appetite is a summer symptom and not seek treatment, leading to daily weight loss, pale complexion, energy depletion, and affecting future health. Isn't this something to consider?　　"Strong Stomach Essence" can treat all the aforementioned symptoms.　　This medicine can also regulate slow or excessively rapid intestinal peristalsis, aid digestion, and eliminate acidic fermentation products in the intestines. Therefore, it effectively treats acute and chronic enteritis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, even dysentery with twenty or thirty bowel movements a day, loose stools, constipation, and hemorrhoidal bleeding. Taking "Strong Stomach Essence" can cure these conditions. Because it contains lecithin, it is an excellent product for smokers with constipation and for quitting smoking.　　"Strong Stomach Essence" is a compound preparation containing yeast, calcium, iron, and other nutrients. In addition to enhancing digestive power, it also provides nutritional supplementation. Therefore, it is highly effective for general weakness, recovery from severe illnesses, and people with malnutrition and anemia. Due to the vitamin B potency of the yeast it contains, it can treat beriberi caused by vitamin B deficiency. Many previous stomach medicines could only treat stomach diseases and did not have the additional effect of treating intestinal disorders. Now, "Strong Stomach Essence" contains multiple nourishing salts, thus achieving the practical effect of increasing appetite and providing nutrition. Dr. Deng Yuanhe's Random Notes on Lung Disease　　Clinic: Corner of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road　Consultation Hours: 4 PM to 6 PM　　Is There Really a Specific Cure for Tuberculosis?　　Since Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus as the causative agent of tuberculosis, treatment for lung disease has taken a further step. However, the tubercle bacillus has an acid-resistant waxy coating that resists any medicinal power. Therefore, treatment methods, in addition to surgery when appropriate for the symptoms, mostly focus on increasing the body's nutrition to help the natural healing ability to resist the disease. Looking at modern lung medications, most of them emphasize this type of therapeutic effect, such as increasing appetite, strengthening nerves, and invigorating blood. These are methods of treating the symptoms, aiming for temporary relief only, and seeking a radical cure is difficult. However, "Bu Fei Na Er" is different because its power directly acts on the lungs. Its effects include eliminating the waxy coating of the tubercle bacillus and reducing oxygen in the lung tissue, making it impossible for the tubercle bacillus to escape the drug's attack, ultimately leading to its death. Thus, tuberculosis can be cured. However, this medicine must be taken continuously for several bottles or more because lung disease is different from other diseases and should not be rushed for quick results. This medicine is mild and can be used with confidence.　　In 1830, Sommerbrodt applied Kreosot from wood oil to various respiratory disorders, such as chronic catarrh of the bronchial tubes, cough asthma, etc., with special effectiveness. However, due to its toxicity, it was later refined and incorporated into "Bu Fei Na Er." Therefore, this preparation effectively treats asthma, chronic cough with stubborn phlegm, pertussis in children, and colds. Once applied, its effectiveness is immediately noticeable.　　For lung disease patients with hemoptysis, coughing up phlegm, cough, chest pain, reduced appetite, stomach weakness, night sweats, and body emaciation, it is best to take "Bu Fei Na Er" in addition to separately taking "Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nu Rong" for women to invigorate the body. The former can treat cerebral weakness, dizziness, insomnia, and palpitations in lung disease patients, and it can also treat nocturnal emission and kidney deficiency in men. The latter can regulate menstruation and nourish blood. Combined treatment leads to remarkable recovery. Self-Treatment for Hidden Illnesses  By Dr. Jin Yueren　　Hidden illnesses in women refer to diseases that are generally difficult to talk about, and leukorrhea is one of them. The causes of this disease include incomplete ovarian development, physical weakness, mechanical stimulation, rupture of local mucous membranes leading to inflammation, and unclean contact. In short, there are many causes, and the dangers are also great. Patients constantly feel discomfort in the lower body, with a constant flow of foul-smelling fluid, local ulceration, affecting urination, urethral stinging pain, and abdominal distension. It often induces menstrual difficulties and becomes a major cause of infertility. Therefore, every patient with this disease should not neglect it just because it is common.　　General doctors also spend a lot of time researching leukorrhea, but they have never achieved the goal of radical cure. However, "Carter's Vaginal Tablets," invented by Carter, are highly effective for all types of leukorrhea, regardless of whether it is old or new. This tablet has the function of killing bacteria and preventing decay, and it has no side effects. Every patient can secretly treat themselves at home, inserting one tablet into the deep part of the vagina every night before going to bed. Wash it away the next morning, and you can go about your business. You can gradually eliminate leukorrhea. However, those with incomplete development and physical weakness can also take "Bu Nu Rong." Those infected with gonorrhea can also take "Clinon." Taking them in this way will be more effective. A New Contribution to Gonorrhea Treatment  By Dr. Yao Juyan　　　　　The tenacious gonococci must be thoroughly eradicated. If not treated aggressively at the onset, they often spread to complex tissue areas. If patients repeatedly fail to receive treatment, the gonococci dispersed in local tissues will further invade, causing various complications that are difficult to manage. Doctors in Europe and America previously only performed local sterilization and anti-inflammatory treatments without considering the gonococci that are good at escaping. Therefore, one problem was solved, but another arose, ultimately failing to achieve the goal of radical cure. Instead, this expanded the gonococci's territory, making them even more difficult to deal with.　　However, Dr. Peter, a master of venereology, had unique insight and knew that to radically cure gonorrhea, it was necessary to eliminate all gonococci. Therefore, he devoted his life to research and finally invented "Clinon." After taking this medicine, all stages of gonorrhea can be treated. It can stimulate the body's blood antitoxins and bactericidal agents to thoroughly carry out the encirclement and suppression of gonococci in all parts of the body, leaving no survivors. Major doctors in Europe and America have unanimously praised it as a new contribution to modern gonorrhea treatment. Since the invention of this medicine, all crude and poorly manufactured chromatic preparations for local permeation and sterilization have been overthrown. Regardless of new-onset gonorrhea, such as redness and swelling of the glans and foreskin, stinging pain and burning in the urethra, and acute symptoms of pus and blood discharge, or secondary and concurrent complications such as orchitis, posterior urethritis, prostatitis, vasitis, and seminal vesiculitis in chronic gonorrhea; and vaginal gonorrhea, vulvar gonorrhea, uterine gonorrhea, and gonorrheal leukorrhea caused by unclean contact in women, all can be completely cured in the shortest period. However, if women feel that there is unclean discharge in the vagina, they can use "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" externally to cleanse the leukorrhea. This has the wonderful effect of both internal and external care, complementing each other. Dr. Dai De's Lecture on Endocrinology　　Clinic: Opposite the Tonghe Bank on Ningbo Road　　Appropriate Treatment for Underdevelopment　　Regardless of gender, if a person feels that their development is not complete, they must pay attention to whether their endocrine function is abnormal. If this condition is known, they must find a way to treat it as soon as possible. The only treatment for underdevelopment in young people is what is now called organ therapy.　　The causes of underdevelopment, in addition to congenital factors, are mostly acquired. Indulging in masturbation, early marriage, and excessive sexual activity lead to the loss of gonadal development function, and the endocrine functions of other organs are also affected. Therefore, there are symptoms such as small lower body, frequent erotic dreams leading to nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and even sperm depletion, lethargy, palpitations, insomnia, back pain, weak legs, dizziness, and forgetfulness. In women, there are irregular menstruation, chlorosis, and underdeveloped breasts and buttocks, leading to premature aging and infertility.　　Regarding the appropriate treatment for this condition, it is advisable to take "Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nu Rong" for women, invented by Merrell, which will easily and quickly cure the above symptoms of underdevelopment. "Bu Ti Kang" and "Bu Nu Rong" are made from healthy animal testicles and ovarian hormones, which can transform the tissues of the reproductive system and promote their development, as well as correct pathological conditions. They can also make muscles firm, skin delicate, and restore youthfulness. However, if suffering from severe nocturnal emission and sperm leakage, you can also take "Yu Jing Pian" at the same time to strengthen the vas deferens, which will be more effective. "Clinon" Public Testimonials　　Excessive Indulgence　　Mr. Li Canhua, a young and handsome man, prided himself on being romantic. Unfortunately, he indulged too much and frequented brothels, resulting in gonorrhea. He believed that he was physically strong and did not seek treatment. He delayed for several years, and the discharge was intermittent. If he engaged in excessive labor, the discharge would flow like a stream. He felt like insects crawling in his penis on weekdays, or it would be unbearably painful, and his testicles would swell, making it difficult and painful to walk. He tried various medicines without any effect. After Dr. Yao Juyan performed serum and vesicle examinations, he was diagnosed with gonorrheal orchitis. He took "Clinon" for about three weeks, and the discharge stopped. He continued to take four more bottles, and at the same time, he took "Bu Ti Kang" to warm and disperse the swelling of the testicles and to supplement his weak body. After about a month, he was completely cured. Now, Mr. Li has been admitted to a company and works there. He has completely repented of his previous behavior and is said to be holding his wedding in the autumn.　　Feudal Thinking　　Madam Wang Hemei, after marriage, had a bad relationship with her husband because she devoted herself to machine weaving. Her husband then engaged in prostitution and later transmitted gonorrhea to his wife, resulting in leukorrhea, lower body erosion, stinging pain in the vagina, irregular menstruation, abdominal distension, and loss of health and beauty. Her dark circles were black, and she was mentally exhausted. Her in-laws, due to their outdated thinking, insisted that their son take a concubine. A neighbor showed Madam Wang the medicine "Clinon," and she bought and took it to eliminate the gonorrhea, with very good results. She then used "Carter's Vaginal Tablets" externally, inserting one or two tablets into the vagina every night to treat the leukorrhea. With internal and external treatment, she recovered in about five weeks. She then continued to take two bottles of "Bu Nu Rong" to regulate her menstruation and nourish her blood. Her body became strong, and her relationship with her husband gradually improved. Soon, she became pregnant.　　Unbearable Pain　　Mr. Lin Dawen, previously attended a friend's banquet. After drinking, he went to a dance hall and met a dancing girl. Soon, they developed a romantic relationship. Little did he know that the other party was an unclean woman, and he contracted gonorrhea. He experienced stinging pain and burning in the urethra, difficulty urinating, pus discharge, and redness and swelling of the glans and foreskin, causing unbearable pain. Later, he was introduced by a friend to Dr. Dai De for treatment, who diagnosed him with the most severe stage of acute gonorrhea. He was instructed to take the special medicine "Clinon" to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and reduce swelling. In less than three weeks, the inflammation and swelling subsided, and he was completely cured. After several examinations, there was no gonorrheal reaction.　　Weak Body Infected with Gonorrhea　　Mr. Zhao Tianfeng was weak and ill. He then contracted gonorrhea, making his body even weaker. Nocturnal emission and gonorrhea occurred together, and repeated treatments were unsuccessful. Fortunately, Dr. Chen Shaohua instructed him to take "Clinon" to clear the internal gonococci, and at the same time, take "Bu Ti Kang" to strengthen his body and stop nocturnal emission. It can also help treat gonorrhea. After taking it for four or five weeks, he was completely cured, and his body became stronger than ever. Water Therapy for Nocturnal Emission  By Dr. Dai De　　Patients with nocturnal emission often develop the disease due to masturbation, leading to neurasthenia and relaxation of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. With slight excitement, nocturnal emission occurs. Frequent erotic dreams occur during sleep. Over time, physical strength declines, the spirit becomes depressed, palpitations intensify, back pain occurs, and overall nutrition decreases, often leading to reproductive failure and even paralysis and death caused by nocturnal emission.　　This disease can be treated with hydrotherapy.

Dr. Yao Juyan's Gonorrhea Lecture　　Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road　Consultation Hours: 10 AM to 6 PM　　Attention and Treatment for Chronic Gonorrhea　　In principle, acute gonorrhea is generally easier to treat than chronic gonorrhea. However, the difficulty in treating chronic gonorrhea is often due to patients neglecting the severity of their condition. Chronic gonorrhea is often neglected because the external symptoms are not obvious, and the pain is not as severe as in the acute stage. Even if it occasionally recurs, patients still do not take it seriously. As a result, it becomes more and more severe, eventually leading to unforeseen complications that threaten life. After gonorrhea enters the chronic stage, the gonococci also deeply infiltrate the latent lymphatic system and take the opportunity to flare up, causing various subsequent symptoms to occur simultaneously. For example, orchitis and prostatitis often occur after chronic gonorrhea.　　Those who have had gonorrhea should undergo multiple examinations. Often, it cannot be proven in one examination, and it may take more than ten examinations to find the gonococci. Therefore, it is essential to be treated by an experienced doctor. However, there are also cases where the patient themselves is cured, but they do not know that their spouse is also infected, leading to repeated transmission. The appropriate treatment for chronic gonorrhea is to use anti-gonorrheal serum and X-ray and electrotherapy. One should also take Clinon to generate an anti-gonorrheal immune effect in the body to eradicate the gonococci and achieve anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and diuretic effects. The deep-seated gonococci can also be eliminated, avoiding the risk of recurrence. At the same time, if the spouse has gonorrheal discharge, in addition to taking Clinon internally, Carter's Vaginal Tablets should also be used externally as suppositories to eliminate the leukorrhea, which can achieve a complete cure!</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement - Casual Remarks on Shantytowns by Fang Kewen</p>
<p>Thanks to the resistance of over two thousand people armed with chamber pots and brooms, and the appeals for help, the shantytown residents of Eastern Shanghai have won a small victory, a temporary reprieve from demolition. This victory is temporary. When the extension expires, under the guise of "tidying up the city," those poor shantytown residents will still face a tragic fate.</p>
<p>In order to avert this tragic fate, and recognizing that the fall of the lip leads to the exposure of the teeth, the shantytown residents of the Eastern Muddy West have organized a Shantytown Association. At the joint meeting, the chairman proposed the following suggestions: (1) Expedite the construction of affordable housing so that every shantytown resident has a place to live; (2) Increase workers' wages and establish affordable factories; (3) Relax the regulations for rickshaw driver registration; (4) Shantytown residents should automatically organize into an association for systematic management; (5) Limit the increase in shantytowns; (6) Automatically conduct household registration surveys; (7) Implement baojia self-governance, with every ten households forming a group. If the first suggestion can be realized, and the shantytown residents have the financial means to live in the new housing, then suggestions (4), (5), (6), and (7) can be abolished. As for suggestions (2) and (3), aside from the third suggestion which is possible, the second suggestion is excessively idealistic. At present, the shantytown residents are living on three days of work or are even unemployed. As long as they have work, how can they dare to think about "increasing workers' wages"? As for establishing affordable factories, the existing factories are successively falling into a state of semi-shutdown. Whether affordable factories can be established is obvious and need not be further discussed.</p>
<p>Regarding the first suggestion, "expedite the construction of affordable housing," naturally we hope it can be "expedited" for the sake of "city appearance" and the "hygiene" of shantytown residents. However, even if the Public Works Department builds affordable housing, whether the shantytown residents have the ability to live there is still a question. According to the letter of appeal the shantytown residents made to the Citizens' United Association, it states: "Because the market is depressed, the economy is tight, and industry is declining... Because young people are working half a month out of the month, averaging four cents per day, relying on six dollars per month. If it is just one person, they can barely survive, but if there are old and young in the family, they have to use this little income to buy bean dregs and broken rice to cook with yellow vegetable leaves... If we are demolished and have to live in apartments, I am afraid it will be difficult to do, because the cost of three days of work is not enough to cover the rent..." From this, it is not difficult to see whether the shantytown residents can afford "affordable housing." Although the resolution of the Shantytown Association also has the clause "requesting the Public Works Department to expedite the construction of affordable housing to prevent the shantytown residents from being displaced," if the rent is not free or set extremely low, the "displacement" of the shantytown residents will likely still be unavoidable.</p>
<p>The second issue is "limiting the increase in shantytowns." Naturally, if the market improves, limiting the increase in shantytowns will not be difficult. Not only limiting the increase, but even "ordering demolitions" would not be a problem. If people can live better lives, who would want to live in dirty, dark shacks? However, under the current social organization, the hope of the market improving is so slim, almost a fantasy. Under internal and external troubles, natural disasters and man-made calamities, rural people are being driven to the cities, and urban workers are being swept into the tide of unemployment. Under the various aggressions of imperialism, China as a quasi-colony has formed a situation of total collapse. Who can "limit" the "non-increase" of shantytowns?</p>
<p>The shantytown issue is one link in the social problem. If the entire social problem cannot be resolved, then there will be no way to resolve it. The Fair by Lin Hao</p>
<p>This small, gray room is filled with suffocating depression: a faint, powerless ray of light penetrates through the windows covered in dust particles. The rooster crows fiercely, and the sound of "ooh ooh ooh" constantly disturbs this small village, everything seems to be exuding an active vitality. The light in the room is dim, making Houfa's face full of wrinkles even uglier. His brows are almost touching each other with worry, carefully chewing over his troubled face. No one would doubt that she harbors a lot of melancholy! In her heart! She carried a bowl, chopsticks, vegetable porridge, and other things from the stove, walked to the edge of the table where Houfa was sitting, and began to complain about her husband, nagging:</p>
<p>"I said, isn't it better if you don't go? With all the chaos and war, you'll be dragged off right away: Think, what will happen to us, mother and son? Mao Mao's dad, I'm really afraid of you going!"</p>
<p>"Woman, what do you know!" Houfa took the porridge and vegetables with both hands, rolling his eyes. "The public officials all said: This new batch of recruits won't be conscripting: Yesterday when I came back, I ran into Chief Hu Si on the street, and I asked him, and he said it was just rushing you to the fair, nothing like that: Old Ma, who strikes the night watch, also rang the gong. (Note: Ringing the gong means telling the villagers not to panic.) And…" He paused, lowered his head, and busied himself with the chopsticks scraping the porridge. Houfa's wife just stared blankly at him in a daze.</p>
<p>Zhaimao, sitting opposite Houfa, opened his round eyes, dragging his snot, gesturing and stuttering, "Daddy, are you going to the fair? To pick plums to sell again! You have to give me some when you come back, right? Red, red blood plums." Then, turning his head to his mother, he said, "Mom! Why don't you let Dad go? Dad earns money, we have food to eat, and even more plums! Hee hee." His mother suddenly slapped him: "Little monkey, what do you know?"</p>
<p>Houfa ate the porridge hastily, put down the bowl and chopsticks, casually wiped his mouth. He picked up his water pipe and tobacco pouch from the table, packed a pouch of tobacco, filled the pipe, and went to the stove to light the fire and smoke: He conveniently picked up two bamboo baskets in the corner of the wall, and found the carrying pole behind the door and went out. Houfa's wife hurried to the door: "According to me..."</p>
<p>"According to you, don't go! Woman, will money sprout wings and fly into our arms?" He glared fiercely at his wife, spat, hung the baskets on the ends of the carrying pole, and with a heave, got it onto his shoulder, then bit the water pipe in his mouth. He puffed hard and vigorously, then took off, heading towards A Gui's house. Mao Mao followed a few steps happily and then went back.</p>
<p>"Hey! A Gui, let's go!" Houfa shouted on the path in front of A Gui's door. There was no sign of A Gui, but A Gui's wife stuck her neck out from the door: "He went a long time ago!"</p>
<p>Houfa suddenly realized with a dawning understanding that A Gui had been lying to him when he said he would go to the fair together yesterday. He had already left on his own: That turtle son of a bitch, he wanted to get to the market early. Suddenly, he thought of Changgen, Fuchun, A Chang, Jinshui, and the brothers in Tangwan, who had all probably gone to the market: With so many people, it would be terrible, the market prices would rise step by step, and it would be difficult to do business; Thinking this, he quickened his pace, really wishing he could grow wings and fly there.</p>
<p>Here, Houfa's wife waited until the sun had set, but she still hadn't seen Houfa come home. The little deer in her heart kept jumping uneasily. Carrying Mao Mao, she bolted the door and went to A Gui's house. It just so happened that A Gui's wife came out from inside and immediately opened her mouth, "Sister-in-law A Gui, has your A Fei come home yet? Alas! It's really, it's bound to be ominous. I told him long ago that he couldn't go, he just kept saying there was no danger, with an evil mouth and an evil face, going: Saying that old Ma who strikes the watch rang the gong: Chief Hu Si also said he could go, not hesitating at all, you see: It's really not early! Still hasn't seen a shadow. Oh God! What kind of sin is this?"</p>
<p>"The spirit just came back! It's the common people who deserve to suffer, what kind of civil war is this again!"</p>
<p>At this time, two or three, three or five, scattered people on the street gathered in piles, talking like news. Soon, they formed a large group of thirty or fifty women, and their voices were chaotic like the sound of brushing horses in every household in the morning, sounding annoyingly, with occasionally a few high and sharp voices, these were the cranes among the chickens, sounding even more moving. The wife of that Changgen was a notable crane: "As I see it, not to say something unlucky, I'm afraid he's already been dragged away!"</p>
<p>Just like a prisoner facing the death penalty, everyone put on an unknowing, bitter face, you looked at her, she looked at that, quietly, silently for a while. However, they had the same terror in their hearts, the same anxiety, the same resentment, and the same doubts. But, Jinshui's wife, the well-known gossiper, broke the silence: "Let's go to Tangwan to see if they've come back. What's the use of standing here? It looks like they're definitely going to be dragged away."</p>
<p>Like a swarm of bees, they rushed there again, stretching their necks, staring unblinkingly.</p>
<p>"Someone's coming!" Someone with sharp eyes said, happy almost to the point of jumping up.</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred eyes widened. Look: - that's right, there's someone, running as fast as he can. (Hoping it's him.) Houfa's wife prayed silently.</p>
<p>When that person got closer, A Chang's father suddenly ran over and embraced him, saying:</p>
<p>"What's wrong, why are you in such a hurry?"</p>
<p>"They… they… were all dragged… dragged… away!" A Chang said breathlessly, "I… I was lucky… I slipped… away…"</p>
<p>The old man's face showed infinite comfort: His own child was fortunately unharmed.</p>
<p>But, like a bomb, it shattered everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>"Oh my God!"</p>
<p>"I told him he couldn't go!" Houfa's wife wiped her tears and cried.</p>
<p>"Heartless people!"</p>
<p>"Wah..." Mao Mao opened his mouth and cried too.</p>
<p>It got dark. The village was still filled with cries and curses.</p>

<p>The Story of Two Cents by Zhang Lin</p>
<p>Unemployed, I drifted back to Zhouyougang with a broken heart. We didn't talk much. My wife still had a pair of heavy eyes. The house was even more dilapidated.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to worry, my temper became violent. One day, I again asked my wife to get some rice from her mother's house. She refused. For some reason, fire burned in my heart. I beat my wife. My wife was forced to go with a bruised face to her mother's house. When my wife brought back two cents for me, I felt a surge of shame. I wanted to hold her and cry. We were both sufferers, both weak. After coming to my house, she had been living secretly like an abandoned dog, secretly working. This reckless vent! But I was again protected by the pride and self-defense that a man should have. I grabbed the money and went to the street to buy rice.</p>
<p>The sea stretched out quietly, mockingly shining with slight waves. I walked on the familiar dirt, looking at the shore where I had spent my entire childhood. Scenes flashed uncomfortably across my mind, disappearing happy images.</p>
<p>"Lou Lou, is that you? When did you come to the government seat?" Turning around, the person asking the unfamiliar question was a dark and thin face. I couldn't remember who it was, only that pair of sunken eyes, the same line-shaped eyebrows, still seemed a bit familiar.</p>
<p>"It hasn't been long! Alas, you don't recognize me anymore, Liansheng is my name!" Liansheng, since we parted, we haven't met once. For the sake of their own lives, these childhood friends gradually became estranged, gradually disappearing from the bottom of their hearts. Tonight's sudden encounter, I didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>"You're Liansheng! Oh, many years since we met, I really didn't recognize you. How have you been lately?" Seeing his clothes, I knew what his life was like.</p>
<p>"Me, alas, you see... You were living a good life in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>He laughed, pointing to his beggar-like clothes. He deliberately tried to laugh as if he didn't care, but the laugh only made him look more pitiful.</p>
<p>"I'm just getting by." I only shook my head negatively. In such a situation, it was certainly not permissible for me to complain.</p>
<p>We couldn't find anything to say, each looking at the sky, looking at the sea, two pairs of eyes avoiding each other. Two old friends who had been separated for eight years carried their own pain and remained silent.</p>
<p>"Me, have we been friends for many years?" He suddenly said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>His eyes seemed excited, shimmering, turning red like the evening glow in a noodle shop. I didn't know what was going to happen, just nodded subconsciously.</p>
<p>"It's nothing," he said with an unnatural smile. "Lou Lou, I know your family isn't doing well either, but the acquaintances here are all scattered. I've been wandering on this island all year round, and I don't have a home either, alas, we have to be honest. I haven't eaten for three days. Can you give me two or three cents?" His eyes were even redder. In the reflection of the evening glow, I could see his hands shaking. His eyes dared not look at me, only deliberately averted to the distance.</p>
<p>"What do I do with these two cents?" I felt my face burning, my hands shaking. What to do? Give it to him? What about myself, what about my wife? We also haven't eaten for a day! If I don't give it to him, I can't be so heartless to eight or nine years of friendship. I took the two cents to the mouth of my pocket, to my chest, but my hand suddenly shrank back, looking at his small body like a stray dog. He turned his face, our eyes met again, but also immediately parted.</p>
<p>"Liansheng, I, I only have two cents, take it!" My fingers were trembling, my heart was jumping madly, suppressing my rapid breathing, I heavily took the two cents from the mouth of my pocket.</p>
<p>His face was strained, his eyes were staring at me like nails, flickering with suspicion. He suddenly pulled back his outstretched hand to take the money, and said hoarsely, "I shouldn't make things difficult for you, I understand. Haha, I remember, I have a place, a friend's house where I can get a meal. Thank you, we'll see you tomorrow!" He twitched his face as if smiling, and without waiting for my reply, he dragged his staggering steps and disappeared into the rice paddies below the embankment. I took the two cents in a daze and walked towards the street. Radio Drama</p>

<p>Mother of Abyssinia</p>
<p>The Italian army approached a certain village in Abyssinia. The villagers fought back furiously, destroying roads with explosives and diverting rivers, while launching guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>The mother's son, of course, also followed all the young people to fight, leaving the mother, daughter-in-law and children at home.</p>
<p>The mother was a kind woman. She enthusiastically donated the money she had worked so hard for to the country, implementing Emperor Selassie's words:</p>
<p>If you have two pieces of clothing, be willing to donate one; if you have three meals a day, be willing to eat only two.</p>
<p>The mother also generously helped A Jinu, who owed someone money. She also earnestly told the young man: Really, police officer, how can you lock up young people at this time? Mara, you're not good either. How can you ask A Jinu for debts? Listen, the sound of cannons is so loud, everyone go to fight! Who made our family so poor? Isn't it the foreign capitalists? Let's ask them for debts!</p>
<p>Really, we will always have a day to demand this debt of blood from the enemy! Not someday, but today. Let's demand this debt of blood today! The young people also realized.</p>
<p>However, because the Abyssinians were enlightened, it made Daly angry and exposed the bestial nature of the massacre even more nakedly. Airplanes, cannons, machine guns, poison gas, further oppressed the body of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>However, airplanes, cannons, machine guns, and poison gas cannot eliminate the Abyssinians' heart to save the country. Instead, it increased their courage to resist and strengthened their national salvation will. The enemy also dropped despicable and absurd leaflets. Neighbor B and others picked them up at the mother's house and discussed surrendering. Just as her son came back and heard the words of surrender, he angrily killed Neighbor B. The son roared loudly at the people: We only have one way, and that is to resist, to resist desperately!</p>
<p>At this time, the enemy launched a large-scale attack. The traitors also realized that surrendering would also lead to death, and seeking the League of Nations was useless, so they had to resist desperately.</p>
<p>The war became more intense. All the oppressed people of the world, such as the people of Italian Somaliland and the working people of Italy, also felt their own oppression and spontaneously rose up to help the people of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>The two races also fought more bravely - the son was killed in battle, and the daughter-in-law filled the gap. The traitors came, and everyone exposed their theories of national funding and jointly attacked the traitors. Eliminating the national traitors is just… Even if… came</p>
<h3>Petition to Party and Government by All Workers of Hongxing Hosiery Factory Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Hongxing Hosiery Factory on Cai Shi Road in the French Concession, under the pretext of processing worker registration, announced a shutdown at the end of last month. After mediation by party and government organs, it was limited to resume work on the 20th. When the time came, the factory insisted on dismissing eight union directors, which aroused the indignation of all workers and has not been resolved for many days. Now the factory employs workers and deceives superiors. Upon hearing the news, all workers were panicked and set off yesterday in different directions to petition. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Petition by All Workers: The factory originally scheduled to resume work on the 20th of this month, and at that time posted a notice dismissing eight enthusiastic union directors, including Deng Yixin and Shi Xiuying, refusing them entry to the factory, which aroused the indignation of all workers. They refused to enter the factory to work and quietly waited for the party and government organs to mediate according to the law. Because the factory saw that the workers refused to resume work, it instructed Li Youpei, a senior factory official, to hire more than 20 workers to petition the party and government organs yesterday morning, intending to obscure everything. Upon hearing the news, the workers were panicked. More than 300 people gathered in the Tangjiawan Assembly Hall and set off in batches to petition the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, and presented the truth in person. Li Weixiong of the Municipal Party Department and Wang Xianqing of the Social Affairs Bureau received them and replied that they considered the factory's unreasonable dismissal of workers inappropriate and instructed the workers to wait quietly for mediation and not to cause other incidents. They had to leave at one o'clock in the afternoon, and in the afternoon, they went to petition Du Yuesheng, Lu Jingshi, and Zhou Xuexiang, the acting chairman of the General Labor Union.</p>
<p>Petition for Relief: The Second District Knitting Industry Union yesterday submitted a petition to the party and government organs for relief regarding the dispute at the Hongxing Hosiery Factory. The original petition stated, "In order to request the Hongxing factory to be ordered quickly not to dismiss Shi Xiuying and other eight people unreasonably, and to quickly withdraw the criminal prosecution, and not to create unnecessary complications, to quell public anger and resolve the incident. The union previously reported to your (union) (bureau) for verification and handling regarding the unreasonable dismissal of Shi Xiuying and other eight people by the Hongxing factory. Now, the union examines the public sentiment and finds it truly indignant. Numerous reports have been received stating that the Hongxing factory at this time is resorting to any means, secretly sending its confidant and running dog Li Youpei to secretly buy off workers with heavy prices, conspiring to create labor disputes to achieve its private ends. The union members and workers are extremely indignant upon hearing this. If they are not comforted soon, accidents may be unavoidable. Therefore, we urgently submit this petition, dispatching Zhang Zhuyun, together with more than 300 union members and workers of the Hongxing factory, directly petitioning your (union) (bureau), requesting that the Hongxing factory be quickly ordered not to dismiss workers unreasonably, and to quickly withdraw the criminal prosecution, and not to create unnecessary complications, to quell public anger and resolve the incident, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<p>Telegram to President Jiang: An urgent telegram to Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission. The Hongxing Hosiery Factory in Shanghai, this time, due to failing to fulfill the work resumption notice and printing illegal characters such as "shall be subject to the most severe punishment" to force workers to register, caused a dispute. The responsibility for this has long been determined by the municipal party and government. For more than ten days, the factory has not come to its senses and has colluded with former important officials in the Social Affairs Bureau to carry out extensive activities, and illegally dismissed eight workers, secretly sending its confidants to buy off labor traitors with heavy money, conspiring to make trouble, hoping to achieve its private goals of destroying the labor movement, disregarding the country, and using industry as a last-ditch gamble, which is extremely absurd and perverse. Your Excellency cherishes the people, and the people are grateful. All citizens should be careful and comprehensive, considering the overall situation, so that they can extricate themselves from difficulties and hardships. Now, the Hongxing factory is not hesitating to do this, which is extremely heartbreaking. I implore Your Excellency to show compassion and to show the majesty of national law with the wrath of thunder, ordering the municipal party and government to order the Hongxing factory not to dismiss workers, to stabilize society and benefit the people's livelihood. This would be most fortunate. Shanghai Second District Knitting Industry Union respectfully.</p>

<h3>Olympic Torch Relay Passes Corinth Canal Bridge, Residents Along the Way Enthusiastically Welcome and Celebrate</h3>
<p>Olympia, 20th (National Electric) The Olympic torch relay, with 3,000 runners each running one and a half miles, continues in a very solemn performance. The first section of this 1,837-mile relay will be completed by Condylis of Greece. Afterwards, it will pass through six countries including Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. The final torch will be carried into the Berlin Olympic Games by Louis of Greece, the winner of the marathon race held in Athens in 1896. He will complete the final section of the relay at 4:00 PM on August 1st.</p>
<p>Athens, July 21st (National Haitong Du Electric) The Olympic torch relay continued all night yesterday, passing through the rugged roads between Mount Loponi and Sas, and then out onto the plains. The villages and towns along the way were warmly welcomed. The torch may reach Corinth by noon today. The first ceremony en route will be held at the altar built on both sides of the public market here. Tonight, the torch may reach Athens. Bishops and priests will wear ancient Greek robes to welcome the torch. The Greek celebration of the Olympic Games will be held in Athens.</p>
<p>Athens, July 21st (National Haitong Du Electric) The torch relay, which departed from Mount Olympus, arrived here this afternoon. The crowd of spectators was huge. King George II of Greece, cabinet members, and other domestic dignitaries were waiting on a specially constructed observation platform to witness the arrival of the torch and participate in the celebration ceremony. When the runner holding the torch arrived at the Parthenon, a priest stood up and lit a lamp on the altar in front of the Parthenon. The light of this lamp will not be interrupted until the closing of the Olympic Games. Then, he blessed the torch, saying, "The spirit of ancient Olympus is still immortal. May the light of this torch shine forever and illuminate the nations participating in the Olympic Games with the light of peace. Before this temple of Pallas Athena, on the sacred stone of the Acropolis, I wish heaven to bless the athletes of the 11th Olympic Games in this city."</p>
<p>After this blessing, the torch was carried by a runner to the Athens stadium, where a similar ceremony was held. By the time the second runner carried the torch to Delphi, it was already night.</p>
<p>At 11:30 this morning, the ancient Olympic torch arrived in Corinth, where the residents gathered in the public market to welcome it. There were also residents watching along the way. The church bells rang loudly when the torch arrived. The runner handed the torch to the mayor, who lit the lamp of the altar in front of the city hall with the torch. At the same time, the military band played the Greek national anthem. The public market was decorated with the national flags of Greece and Germany. There were also 30 young Greek women performing national dances in front of the altar.</p>
<p>At 12:50, the torch passed over the bridge of the Corinth Canal. This bridge connects the mainland with Loponiirus. This is also the location of King Pelops in mythology. The origin of the Olympic Games is also based on this. King Pelops, in the past Olympic Games, was actually part of the funeral. It is said that it was first held after the death of King Pelops.</p>
<h3>World Games Football Opening Match: USA vs. Italy, August 3rd, 4:00 PM</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Allied Electric) The Olympic football preliminary round combination has been decided.

<h3>Olympic Marathon Route Determined: More Than 42,000 Kilometers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong Electric) The distance of the Olympic marathon race, scheduled to be held on August 9th, will be 42,195 kilometers. Starting from the Olympic Stadium, it will proceed along the shore of Lake Halvel, then onto the Affers automobile road, reaching the halfway point, and then returning along the same route.</p>
<p>Starting at 3:00 PM, it will take about two and a half hours. The reason for choosing this route is to minimize the amount of sunlight the runners are exposed to.</p>
<p>The entire route is marked with white powder, and each section is marked with numbers indicating the number of kilometers to the finish line. High towers have been built at intersections, and obstacles at corners have been removed. Although this route does not have the difficulties of the original route between Marathon and Athens, it is a major test of the endurance of the athletes.</p>
