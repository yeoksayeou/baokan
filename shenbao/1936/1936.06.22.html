<p>日本新任駐華大使川越氏已由神戶乘輪來滬今日可到川越氏歷任我國各地領事與華北日駐屯軍且有深切之關係此决在日三相會議以後秉承政府訓令赴任力謀調整中日邦交當能擺脫夙昔二元外交之苦悶而創立對華外交之新局面歟</p>
<p>川越大使之外交使命據彼出發前之談話似側重於華北方面之經濟提携至其具體方案則據日前同盟社所報道計分三項一曰棉花栽培經濟的技術的援助二日開發煤鐵等礦山三曰建設鐵路由滄石路着手此等計畫雖今茲始有具體化之徵象實乃日本當局數年前早經抉定者日本本爲一先天不足」之小國自入近世以工業膨脹之結果倍感原料之缺乏在奪佔東北四省以後卽復垂涎華北諸省之富源查河北山東兩省棉花產額佔全國產額百分之四四河北山西之煤礦儲量則佔全國儲量半數以上而棉煤二者乃日本工業界最戚缺乏之主要原料此日本當局對於華北開發工作所由深感興味者也</p>
<p>川越大使所揭櫫之經濟提携方案對於日軍正在著著進行之華北分離運動是吾有連鎖關係姑不具論僅就方案本身言之此所謂提携是吾以互惠平等互尊主權爲基礎是吾不致摧殘中國之經濟基礎實乃攸關國本之重要問題不容絲毫忽視者我外交當局在折衝之際首宜加以慎重之考慮也</p>

<p>近年我國進口貨物常以糧食居第一位，如以民國二十四年爲例，進口米麥麵粉及其他雜糧合計共値一億三千六百萬元，的當同化入超額（二億四千三一百萬元）五分之二。近年米麥二項入超之平均數，比之全國產量之平均數，的爲百分之四（小麥速麵粉計之，）每百斤小麥可製成麵粉七十斤）近時工業國家食糧不能自給自足者，固爲一般通例，惟我國工業旣不發達，農民人數之多遠非列可比，而民食亦須依賴外洋，每年漏巵竟達一億元以上，倘遇東亞有事，海外夾源阻絕，糧食恐慌極爲可慮。解央食糧問題之法當然甚多，如開墾荒地，改良農法，禁種鴉片，預防荒災，改善運銷組織，調劑各省之盈虛，恢復積殺倉儲，維持糧價之均衡，又當酌定進口關稅，保護國內農產，庶幾洋米侵銷與穀賤傷農之現象均可消弭於未來。歐戰時德國致敗之中因，爲糧食之不足，已爲周知之事實。保證國民與軍隊糧食之供給，乃爲最緊要之舉。</p>
<p>我國棉花產量年的一千三百萬担，（二十二至二十四年平均）長江黃河兩流城各居半數。我國產棉，供國內消費之需，常虞不足，二十三年國內棉花豐收，二十叫年進口總値的四千萬元，而二十三年則爲九千萬元。輸人棉花多來自印度與美國，印棉以量勝，美棉以質勝，我國棉花普通品質不佳，織維甚短，尙須設法改進。絲茶與大豆向爲我國出口大宗，東省大豆輸出向賴以抵償食糧人超之大部分，今則已非昔比。生絲爲江浙廣東等省農家之副業，極堪重視。二十四年蠶蘭總產額一百四十萬担，生絲總產額九萬五千担，就中江浙一省佔三分之二弱，廣佔四分之一弱。生絲出口與國內消費的各居其半。我國茶葉產額的五百餘萬担，每年輸出的在百萬祖左右，價値的二千萬元。此外經濟作物如蔗糖烟草原料均感不足，歷年洋糖洋烟均爲進口要項。木材亦爲進口大宗，近年輸入數額在三千萬元以上，大部份供建築之用，鐵道枕木數亦不少。且年有增加。木材爲運輸力極小之商品，因以體質重量　，價格極低，故欲開發山林，必自改良運輸節省運費人手。林業副產品以桐油灰絲最有價値，二十叫年度桐油輸出竟達四千萬元之鉅，居出口貨第二位，爲向來所未有。灰絲即柞蠶絲，織綢而外，爲飛機羽翼之材料，桐油則供飛機塗料，故近年需要大增。我國產灰絲的二萬担，以遼　爲中心，近年出口曾達二千萬元，樹膠爲熱帶物產，在近代工業上用途甚廣，海南島爲我國唯一可種樹膠之地。我國畜牧業可分爲二大區域；本郁與東三省爲農村人之區域，西北邊疆爲游牧人之區域，而大興安嶺與陰山山脈爲其天然界線，前者以畜牧爲農村人之副業，後者則以畜牧爲惟一生計。西北各省區產羊毛年的穴十萬担，駱駝毛十萬祖，大部分由天津出口。二十四年統計，羊毛駝毛皮貨地毯叫項，出口共値四千萬元。皮貨多爲狩獵之所獲，地毯多係手工織造品。我國馬匹總數尙乏精確統計，近來馬政廢弛，雄駿戰馬恐已不可多得，馬匹之改良，在軍事上甚關重要。農村區域肉類缺乏，頗賴魚類補其不足。我國漁業狀况亦未經詳細調査。民國二十四年魚介海產進口幾及二千萬元，可見漁業之不振。漁業之發展與航業海軍均有連帶關係。鹽稅爲我國歲入大宗，全國鹽產共計五千五百餘萬担，其中海鹽佔百分之二，我國鹽產自給尙屬有餘，每年輸往日本朝鮮者的六百萬担。</p>
<p>中國礦產以煤鑛爲最重要，全國煤鑛儲量據地質調査所估計爲二千四百六十億噸，居世界第三位，在美國坎拿大之决。然以人口計算，每人僅得五百噸，較之美國每人一萬噸，英國叫千噸，德國一千五百噸，皆不能及，僅過於日本每人一百噸而已。各省煤礦儲量，極不平均，山西省的佔全國總量百分之五十二，陝西省的佔百分之二十九，二者合計百分之八十一，即居五分之四有奇。說者謂山西煤鑛若能開發，常如西歐之有英國，美國之有本西佛尼州。我國重要煤田皆在華北，一旦有事，煤業立遭摧殘，至爲可慮。民國二十二年中國煤產總量爲二千八百餘萬噸，居世界第八位，尙在日本之。是年東北四省產煤九百餘萬噸，的佔三分之一。我國鐵鑛殊爲貧乏，全國儲量十億二千萬噸，平均每人僅得二噸半。遼寗一省獨佔全國鐵鑛儲量百分之七十七，察哈爾佔百分之九。遼寗之於鐵如晋陝之於煤，渤海黃河乃我國礦產命脈所在也。遼寗鐵鑛瓖顧東亞僅讓印度一席，目前已成爲日本鋼鐵業之外府。日本產鐵能力年的一百五十萬噸，鋼曾達二百十萬噸，故日本不但需要國外之礦石，並須吸收印度及遼寗之生鐵爲原料。二十二年統計，遼寗鞍山本溪河　鐵礦產鐵五十萬噸，實際已非我有。內地鐵業極爲凋敝，年不過數萬噸，長江中游湖北安微之鐵鑛皆以礦石輸出日本，無異爲人作嫁。全國土法煉鐵年亦不過十萬噸，大都消費於各當地鐵　之用。以現在全國需求鋼鐵數量言，年達六十萬噸，大部分仰給於英日兩國，廿三廿四兩年鋼鐵進口平均八千萬元，佔全國進口總額百分之八。中國石油儲量佔計爲三十六億桶（每桶四十加倫其中撫順含油頁岩的有十九萬桶，已佔全國總儲量百分之五十三。撫順頁岩油之富居東亞之首席，幾爲美或俄三分之一，世界總量二十分之一其重要可知。中國油產至爲缺乏，撫順異常突起，二十二年產額八萬噸，預計可年產三十萬噸。我國內地石油礦以陝西最有希望，天然石油與油頁岩兼而有之，已開始鑛探油井，結果頗佳，惟產額尙不足計，故我國至少在目前非仰給外國石油不可。二十二年度進口石油，包含煤油柴油汽油三項，共計七千五百萬元，其中煤油居半數，柴油汽油各佔叫分之一。我國金銀產量均微，各的十萬兩左右。錫鑛有餘而銅鑛不足，全國產錫年的九千頓，十九來自雲南，一個舊錫鑛，銅之消費量年的六千噸，生產量僅的十分之一，銅爲電氣材料，間接有關軍事。中國銻鎢二礦特別豐富，湖南之銻，江西之鎢，均可獨步於世界，此一者者均與製造軍火有關。故大爲世人所注目。銻之產額全世界爲一萬六千噸，中國出產四分之二，鎢之產額全世界爲一萬叫千噸，中國出產五分之二强。此二礦在國內無銷路，幾全部出口，反受洋商操縱市價，如能自設煉廠，硏究用途，則此種稀有金屬，豈非奇貨可居。鋁之用途日廣，飛機原料需用允多，鋁可自明礬石提煉而得，浙江平陽之明礬石有二十億噸之多，如提煉試騐成功，可望成爲世界產鋁最多之一國。</p>
<p>中國新式　業以棉紡織業爲代表，據二十三年統計，全國紗廠共一百三十三家，紗綻總數爲五百二十萬枚，其中華商所有者佔百分之五十六，日商所有者佔百分之四十，英商所有者佔百分之四，在各廠中幷有動力布機，四萬三千餘架，其中華商所有者佔百分之四十八，日商所有者佔百分之四十五，英商所有者佔百分之七。中國每千人所有之紡綞數至今仍爲世界主要棉紡織國家之最低者，英國爲此業之霸王，母千人有紡煄一千二百錠，日本每千人亦有一百錠，而中國每千人僅有十二錠，若僅計華商紗廠，每千人尙不足七錠。日本在日俄戰爭以後，國內之需要已可自給自足，並發展海外市塲，日本對華輸出棉織物的居半數。中國棉織業無時不受一重　脅，即在中國境內外國紗廠之競爭，與外國進口棉貨之傾銷，其結果，一部分營業虧損之華商紡廠，乃漸爲日本公司所兼併。二十四年度棉花及棉紗棉布進口達六千五百萬兀，（其中棉紗棉布佔二千三百萬元）當同年入超數値九分之一。中國棉紡織業之地理分布，上海佔半數以上，合無錫南通計之，江蘇一省佔全國三分之二，共地位之重要猶英國之有蘭克夏日本之有大阪。生絲在中日二國爲輸出第一大宗，又均以美國爲最大市塲。大戰以後，日本棉布銷路推及印度南洋，近年更向非洲近東發展，並代生絲而居輸出首席，其生絲因受人造絲壓迫，市價現無上漲之望。我國絲業近年甚爲凋敝，其出口第一位置，早爲大豆取而代之，去年則在桐油之下，而居於第二位。民國十九年江浙絲廠共一百八十餘家，車數五萬五千餘部，連年因歐美絲價低落，停工或閉歇者達五分之三。絲業失敗原因，一方由於日絲賤價傾銷，一方即由於人造絲之崛起。二十四年度我國生絲輛出三千五百萬元，佔出口總額百分之二，同年人造絲，輸入七百萬元，其用途以與天然絲及棉紗交織者甚多。我國毛織業甚爲幼稚，木國呢絨廠出品僅百萬元，二十四年度進口呢絨絨綫合計一千三百萬元。目前毛織品需要日多，改良羊毛，增加織品，自屬必要。生絲價格雖較羊毛爲高，但因其爲國貨，在軍政界之服制，頗有硏究之餘地。我國機器造紙業生產總値將近千萬元，手工造紙當其盛時每年的達五千萬元，近來不足二千萬元，合計本國產紙不足三萬元，然我國每年銷費紙張數値共達七千萬元左右，是年不數之數的四千萬元，仰給於舶來品，洋紙進口歐洲佔一分之二，日本估三分之一。報館之性質與其他企業不同，蓋新聞事業之重要，戰時允甚於平時，新聞紙廠之　立，實不容視爲緩圖。中國水泥銷費量年的六百萬桶，國人自營水泥廠之生產量四百萬桶，不足之數出外輸入，進口水泥價値年的二百萬元。瓷器爲我國固有工業，全國產額的二千萬元，日本全國陶瓷產額八千萬　（日金），我國遠愧不如，近年中國陶瓷出入口價値常爲人超。</p>
<p>中國工業基礎至今做未確立，普通工業如棉織業水泥業尙未發達，而　本工業則成績絕鮮。所謂基本工業者，其製造品不能直接供給消費，而爲一般工業之利器，如機器業是，機器或機械大都與鋼鐵業有關，故有重工業之稱。基本工業之重要性往往遠過於其本身之貨幣價値，如化學工業之產品是。此類工業大都規模宏大，非私人企業所能勝任，又以其關係國利民福　甚巨，故當由國家經營。我國目前鋼鐵業凋敝情形，已見前述。至於機器工廠，多屬資本缺乏，規模狹小。廿四年度機器類（包括紡織機器電氣機器及其他工具）進口價値　千五百萬元，此固表示我國新式工業逐漸發展，要亦國家經濟莫大之漏巵。實業部近籌　中國機器製造廠，洵爲目前要事。電氣業據民國二十三年建設委員會統計，全國電廠四百六十家餘，發電容量四十八萬　（卽六十四萬匹馬力，東三省在外），其中外人經營者雖僅十一家，發電容量則居半數，如上海電力公司佔二十萬匹馬力，上海各工廠動力大都取給於此。我國電廠皆以煤爲燃料，稱爲火電，至水力發電事業尙在勘測中。據建設委員會之計劃，在宜昌長江三峽口設置第一水力發電廠，容量爲三十萬佤（即四十萬匹馬力），建設費的爲四百萬元。水電廠對於化學工業極有關係，國內化學工業寥寥無幾，遠不　用，近年進口大宗如人造絲人造肥料染料皆化學工業之產品，又如造炸藥造毒氣，皆與化學工業有關。在國防上貢獻尤大。造船業亦爲基本工業之一世人稱船舶　英國國富之導綫，日本各種機械工業亦無不與造船業有關，因造船發達而航業大盛，因海運發展而海軍亦强盛。中國軍艦共二萬七千五百噸，自造者佔五分之二，德國日本造者各佔四分之一弱，英國造者佔七分之一。自造軍艦江南造船所佔五分之三，馬尾造船所佔四分之一强。日本造船廠兼能製造飛機，故日本空軍有强大之潛勢力。至於陸軍所用之汽車與加工製造之坦克車，日本工廠之技藝亦與年俱進。我國汽車據二十三年度統計，全國共有五萬輛，軍用飛機，據姚錫光君統計（見二十四年英文中國年鑑）共四百三十三架，又海軍飛機二十四架，汽車飛機殆無一非舶夾品，在國防上觀之，誠爲憾事。凡有遠見之政府，莫不竭力　勵基本工業，不待辭費。</p>
<p>新式運輸機關係我國目前甚感缺乏。全國已成鐵道，據二十二年統計尙不過一萬八千公里，其中國有鐵道的長一萬二千餘公里，佔全國鐵道長度三分之二以上，民業鐵道的二千四百公里，外人承辦之鐵道的爲三千三百餘公里，合佔全國鐵道長度百分之三十。二十叫年度粤漢·隴海·浙贛·同痛等新築路綫共長的一千七百公里，綜計不足、萬公里·較之美國鐵道叫十萬公里，眞有望塵莫及之感·二十三年度日本國有鐵道一萬六千公里，外加私有鐵道約八千公里，共計二萬四千餘公里，平均每四千人有鐵道一公里，我國則二萬人方有鐵道一公里，我國鐵道重嬰幹綫多在長江以北，而允以東三省爲多，的佔全國鐵道投度五分之二，目前已非我有。我國商船總噸數僅有四十萬噸，僅當日本十分之一。日本商船共計四百三十餘萬噸（二十三年統計），爲世界第三海運國，每年有二億元（日金）之運費自海外貨獻母國。我國則巨型海舶現付缺如，國外貿易全恃他人之船隻，即就沿海貿易而論，亦大部分依頓外國商輪，（未完）</p>

<p>— 祝平</p>
<p>四、國民經濟建設之原則</p>
<p>（一）生產之要素為「人力」「地力」　資力　未　生產行動之發展，必須採「人力」「地力」一組　力　予以、當合理之醒置與運用，使成為有系統，組　有意識有　劃之活動、顧生產要　之俁　配　，非　蹴　幾，國民經濟這計劃發展，　咄嗟辦，故人手辦法，唯有將原有經　及生產單位，予以切實調整結合，使成為　　之組織體，然後始得為有目的有　劃　統　　　。</p>
<p>（二）民經濟之建設：應以整個民族為目標，在　　國情况之下，尤　審察各地交通地理之形勢，凡　本工業之創辦，重大工程之建築，　　擇　防　主之安全地帶而設置之。</p>
<p>（三）以　為民經濟組織之基本地域單位，凡　以內之生產，　換，消費，運輸　經濟　為，務使　組織之機構，商業　　活　擊，伸　利於防經濟之動，同時又復適合於個別之圖存。</p>
<p>（四）地方防衛組織，　敎育事業，　與經濟建設打成一片，使其在整個目標之下，相互。助長。</p>
<p>（五）「人力」　生產之重　原素，建　國民經濟，應將社會全部「人力」為有劃之　員凡壯年男女，（假定為十八歲至四十五歲）均有服務働之義務，並祝各地實際需要，規定其應行服務之時期。</p>
<p>（六）縣以內，壯年男女之口數，及期能力之性質——如適於作工，作農，服兵役，充任醫師　護或敎師等——均應為詳細調查，並分別登記，以　隨時動員。</p>
<p>（七）為便利「人力」之動員與統制，應就登記之「人力」，予以嚴密之組織與　當之訓練，「人力」之訓練，除培養其生產技能，及集團工作之精神外，尤須敎其自衛能力，俾得在可能範圍之內，各以　衛之力量，保障其經濟建設事　之安全。</p>
<p>（八）土地為生產必需之工具，各縣應將境內土地之　　　種　，分別測文或調查佔計，並統制其利用，調整其所有關係。</p>
<p>（九）績極　行灌漑，疏　，塡築等水利工事，　增加可耕之而積。</p>
<p>（　）無地農民，應儘量設、給與土地，俾盡「人力」而增「地力」。</p>
<p>（　）各地　酌量創立範模農塲，應用適當之科　方法及機械，　提高產率，　增產量。</p>
<p>（　）　農塲之　生產能力，勵農民，　其自動採用　式耕種技術，或織合作　荘，以謀農業經營之改善及農業生產之增進，政府　於合作　荘，須酌予特　，（如公有機械之使用，技術之指導，運輸之便利，經濟上之恊助，以及文化保衛事業這設備等）以促進農民從事於集體生產。</p>
<p>（十三）副　為農民消納剩餘勞働之尾閭，其影響於農民之收入者甚大，政府須按各地副業分佈情形切實指導，改良其出品，並增加其產量。</p>
<p>（十四）設立健全之農村信用組織，調劑農村金融，以扶植新興之合作田荘及資助一般農業之發展。</p>
<p>（十五）凡各種大規模及基本工業由政府經營或監督之，並以適當之條件或租營」之辦法獎勵國內外資本者之投資。</p>
<p>（十六）各路手工業之具有特殊效用者，政府按各該手工業營　情形，予以鼓勵改進，以補救目前機械生產之不足。</p>
<p>（十七）依政府之財力與需要，逐漸佈　原動力綱　於各地，供給居住製造，運輸等事業所需之光，熟，電等動力。</p>
<p>（十八）輕工業廠這建設須合於下列原則：</p>
<p>凡附近原料出產之地，盡量集中其相聯之各種工　品之製造，俾生產成本可以减少，出品凖便標於统一。</p>
<p>在可能範圍內廣設小規模工廠於　農　中心區域便於農民參加製造工作。使鄉村不至因人口减少，而呈　條之狀態，城市不至因工廠過多，而人口擁擠，造成惡劣之社會環境，而戶口之分佈，亦得以均衡，各地富源，得以普遍　發，即遇暴力摧殘，亦得不致　部被</p>
<p>（十九）在保障設　安全及維護勞働福和之原則下，竭九　整勞資　係，使恊力謀整　國民經濟之發展。</p>
<p>（二十）商品之交換，應予以適當之統制，務使生產者與消費者，及原料供給者與製造者之間，縮短其行程。</p>
<p>（二十一）每一地方商品之進口出口，須予由各該地方商業同業公會聯合　織進出口貿易樞紐，凡商品之進口出口，必須經由該總樞紐辦理之，其有單獨行動者，由同業恊力制裁之。</p>
<p>（二十二）各地消費品之種類數量與來源，以及本地生產品之種類數量及行銷區域，應詳為調查統計，使商品之交換，漸臻合理化，凡非必需之消費品，而又非本國製造者，應儘量限制之。</p>
<p>（二十三）物品價格，應予合理之統制，以保障生產者適當限度之利潤，同時平衡販賣者之盈益。</p>
<p>（二十四）各地金融機關，應使其集中在整個經濟建設計劃之下，充分運用其功能。</p>
<p>（二十五）交通運輸之建設，應使亨適合經濟建設及國防形勢之需　，由中央及省縣各就專業之範圍設計進行。</p>
<p>（二十六）經濟建設之進行，須賴有巨量之　門人才，或　受有適當敎育人員之參加，在開始時，可征調中央及地方現有黨政機關服務人員，各按其能力之性質，分發各地，担任各項適當之工作。</p>
<p>（二十七）關於各級學校敎育之方針，務須儘量切合經濟建設之需要，同時各種文化團體之活動，應集中力量為經濟建設作普遍之宣傳與鼓動。</p>

<p>「親愛的上海同胞、今天兄弟播音的題目、就是「衛生運動要實地履踐起來、」說到衛生兩個字、我想大家都必定以為這是極其通常極期熟悉的一個名詞、可是、亦就　他太通常太熟悉了、而使得我們往往忽略了牠的重要性和偉大性、牠不僅含有保衛個人生命的意義、並且同時是負有保衛整個民族生命的偉大的使命、不過因為民族也就是每個個人的集合　、所以要想做到民族的衛生、就先要做到個人的衛生、要想求得民族的　康、就先要求行得個人的康健、尤其處處在這一十世紀生存競爭極端尖銳化的時代、要想雜持民族的生命、確實不是一件容易的事情、如果智力落後、固然要　淘汰、假使體力不夠、那危險的程度、就　其重大、尤其是我們國家、處在這樣危難的最　的關頭、個體的是否健全、也就是决定整個民族是滯滅亡的關鍵、我們不要小看了衛生不過是早就聽慣了的一個極通常的名詞、我們要切實認識　牠的維持民族生命、復興民族光榮的偉大的使命啊、我們但看希特勒的國社主義、不是高唱着民族健康民族衛生的、「優性人種論」嗎、德國人的體格、已經是非常强健、而他們要想挽救民族的　　、和恢復戰前的地位、還積極着重這一點、還在努力從個人健康做起、何　我們同胞、不早就受人　為「東方病夫」嗎、我們國家、不早就受人稱作「病夫國」嗎、我們要想洗雪這恥辱、我們要想復興我們的民族、親愛的同胞們、我們就得趕快要認識這次衛生運動的意義、而實地的履踐起來、那麼、怎樣才達到衛生的目的呢、怎樣才算實踐了衛生的工作呢、衛生的目地、就是要保持　康、增進健康、也就是要消極的防禦病害、積極的鍜錬體魄、至於要怎樣去做、才算合乎衛生、才能達到這目的、我想上海是我們中國文化的中心、敎育比較上也算是最普及、大多數的市民、可以諮都曾受過初等的敎育、一方面在小學校裏至少讀守一二年的衛生課程另外又時常可從報章種種方面、隨時得些關於疾病健康的知踨、怎樣　地去做、知是知道了、可是關於衛生種種的信條、好像飲食要清凈、衣服要整潔、空氣要流通、起居要有定時等、這都是要隨時隨地去注意、且要日日不斷的注意、也就是因為這個原故、覺得不耐類而忽略了、覺得堅持不下去而中斷了、終於壞的習慣盤據不去、好的習慣、無由建樹起來、其實這個困難、也不過僅是最初實行的一時的現象、等到日子稍久、養成了習慣、便會不單不覺得麻煩和琑碎、並自覺得很自然的很隨便的、就可以動輒合矩、無庸多勞神了、所以我希望各位同胞、如果還沒有明瞭衛生的意義的、趕快趁這次衛生的敎育的訓練的、在這國難極端嚴重的時候、更要替我們的民族前途着想、替自己個人的生命着想、趕快下一個决心、一定要掃除最初實行時的這點小小的障碍、而建樹起整齊清潔蓬勃健旺的生活、在這個最後的關頭、本本就不容許再高談甚麼理論、而衛生也根本就不是口頭上說說的理論、親愛的同胞、我們唯有趕快的實地的履踐起來、可怕的夏令、又已經開始了、這盛夏和初秋的季節、是一切病菌微生物有害的昆蟲最活躍的時期、也就是我們敵人總攻擊的時期、所以無論那一屆的統計、這時期的死亡率、總一定要占最高的數字、天氣又是這樣的炎熱、也正加緊的增加敵人活躍的力量、親愛的同胞們、趕快設法鞏固我們防禦的工程、趕快努力撲滅我們多方的敵人吧、最重要的努力、就是飲食方面的注意、因為這就是一切病菌寄生繁殖的地方、也就是一切敵人攻進我們身體的唯一要道、這當然是要　時謹　、隨地留意、而兄弟今天所希望的、更有極切實而必須做到的兩件事、第一、街道上店家或是小販、祗要是販賣食物的地方、都要有完備的衛生裝置、都是用鐵紗籠罩起來、使得蒼蠅可不到、使得灰　鑽不進去、也就是斷絕了可怕的虎列拉的來源、第二、每個人家的廚房、必須要收拾得很清潔、不新鮮的魚肉、切不要貪便宜買了回來、每天必需的菜蔬、也不要買得太多、讓牠去腐壞、應用的餐具、更要常用開水去冲洗、廢棄的垃圾、也要倒在固定的較遠的塲所、這樣也就是减少病菌寄託的根據地、谷語談得好、「百病從口入」、當這個酷熱的夏天、我們大家尤其要加倍的注意、歸納的說一句、衛生的基本原則、就是要求清潔、飲食要清潔、衣服要清潔、家裏面要清潔、門口　道上也要清潔、而求清潔有個切要的辦法、就是要整齊、求整齊又有個切要的辦法、就是要簡單、譬如就拿我們家裏的廚房來說、要想收拾得很清潔、就要把一切的東西、菜蔬汕鹽燃料碗　等、都擺得很整齊、如有一定的地方、而要求能永遠保持整齊的有秩序的狀態、又要把不當用的東西、不要堆得太多、假使一家祇有四個人、那應祇要留四副碗筷就夠了、有客人來的時候、儘管臨時再取出、如果平常也堆了很多碗筷在外面、一定很容易凌亂、一凌亂就不容易清潔了、所以說東西要求簡單、能簡單而後才能整齊、能整齊而後才能清潔的、常聽到有些人說、、「衛生是有錢人講的話、我們生活很簡單、不容易談到的」、其實這個理由很不充分、因為衛生並不是什麼難以做到的事、祇要平時留意一點、多當心一點、使得生活一切都做到簡單、整齊·清潔·就得了、這不單是每個市民都做得到、並　家庭越簡單、也越容易做到的、兄弟　來不喜歡高談什麼理論、而衛生運動、更不需要高談什麼理論、這次衛生運動、重大的意義、就是希望全上海市的同胞、深切的體認衛生對於保衛個人和復興民族的偉大的使命、而同時大吃一驚　到時機的嚴重、列要切實地履踐起來、公共衛生和個人衛生、是相毒維緊、相互進的、所以公安局對於市衛生上的公共衛生、絕對應當盡力的執行去監督、而最要緊的、還是要每個民衆自己覺悟、自動力行、並隨時隨地盡量勸導他人、以共同完成這重大的使命、這是兄弟今天所渴望於全上海市的同胞的、在這炎熱的氣氛之下、並且以十二萬分的誠意、希望各痊保重、敬祝各位健康快樂、</p>

<h3 id="c172">下屆世運舉行地點　各國宣傳競爭劇烈 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>荷蘭列舉理由八點頗堪注意</p>
<p>本屆世運將於八月一日起在德舉行、而下屆（十二屆）世運之舉行地點、於大會閉幕時即將决定、各國對此問題、均頗注目、而尤以芬蘭日本等國、競爭更烈、至吾國體育當局意見、當然亦希望下屆世運能在中國舉行、設此目的不能達到時、則認為仍在西區較佳、日昨吾體育界收到芬蘭對下顱骨世運舉行地點競爭之宣傳品、列舉八大理由如下、</p>
<p>芬蘭為體育國家、</p>
<p>從一九〇三年起歷屆世運芬蘭均派員參加、</p>
<p>一九〇六年世運在雅典、芬蘭得第一塊金牌獎外、歷屆世運之田徑賽、摔角、器械操、游泳、划艇、拳擊、射術、滑雪、溜冰、芬蘭選手計獲得六十二個世運錦標、及金牌獎、六十個銀牌獎、六十三個銅牌獎、</p>
<p>以成績總計算、芬蘭於世運中常佔優勢、假定以人口密度為比例、則芬裝更屬優秀、若以田徑計算、世運在「史篤克霍倫」舉行時、芬蘭僅次美車而列第二、以後又得保持其原位不變、又一九一一年一九二〇年及一九二四年世運、芬蘭於摔角一項、所得獎牌、較其他各國所得總合猶多、</p>
<p>芬蘭全國三百八十萬國民、上下一心、贊助芬蘭參加世運、其普遍及衆多、實為他國所不及、</p>
<p>芬蘭為提倡體育極早之國家、並且有各項運動專門之經騐智識、在政府當局及地方當局互相合作下、如下屆世運在芬蘭舉行、不論經濟、文化、體育以及任何方面均可保證無缺點發生、</p>
<p>芬蘭距歷屆派選大量選手至世運之國家極近、尤以歐洲各國旅費更省、故如在芬蘭舉行、參加世運之各國選手、必　形踴躍、</p>
<p>芬蘭尤便於游歷者、匯價較低、生活程度不高、風景秀麗、八方島、六萬湖、半夜日、此外　Arftie　之海濱汽車路、均為他國所不及者、</p>

<p>上半時四比零、結果七比二、立功者桂成季良惠堂各二、鎮和一、</p>
<p>是日雖非假期、惟以兩雄相遇、觀衆擠擁倍常、列陣啓　、吾人深自警惕、全神應付步步為營、不稍疏忽、最初十分、各有來往、局勢緊張、旋見桂成邊陲起義、啣枚疾走、以極妙之挑送、深入敵方腹地、至相當角度、右啼掃射、球勢勁而有力、遂破敵門、我方得此先聲、踢來更覺有條不紊、前鋒短傳佳妙、敵衛窮傳、單騎進襲、亦奏一功、與吾人中路短傳、戰略甚顯、遂屯重兵於中、以固其防、曹鄭兩翼、乃更形活動、桂成奔走迅速、以淸脆之脚頭、再破一關、惹得千百球迷、連聲叫好、至是敵衛後分力抵禦、吾人策略亦隨而更變、卒由記者從中路射入一球、造成上局四零之優勢、竟被敵飽以老拳、幸老馮君子風度、毫不與較、卒為不證判其離塲、一時僑胞鼓掌讚美不絕、</p>

<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>「四」戰期中費用之發展與推算</p>
<p>自普法戰爭之後，德意志帝國·便常在推算未來戰爭的費用（註一），以爲擴張備戰儲金額的標額。他的估計方法，便是用上述的第二種。</p>
<p>在一八九〇年，普魯士帝國財政大臣與帝國銀行總裁等，曾推算未來戰爭第一個月內，海陸軍所需的戰　爲五億馬克。以後每决複佔，便每决增加。並當一九〇六年估算時，已發見了對於戰時產業動員的重要，加入了該項的緊急費，就有十四億馬克。及一九一二年，財政參謀本部成立。對於戰費的推算，尤爲認眞而精密。據該部當時推算的結果，以爲總動員第一月內，至少須要二十二億五千萬馬克的戰費；同時產業動員經費，定爲十五億爲克；經濟緊急經費，定爲七億五千萬馬克。三者合計，共須四十五億馬克。此項估計，與其後的事實，竟相差不遠。如一九四年六月三十日至是年八月一日間，其時戰爭尙未發生；但平均每月所需動員費一項，已達十六億七千五百萬爲克。其後戰爭發生，第一年內每月所需的戰費，即達二十億以上。此後即逐年激增，至最後一年，則每月所需之戰費，已達四十二億五千八百萬馬克之最高額。如依各時代之預算，及其後實際的支出，並列比較，我們也可從中觀測其增加之趨勢及其如何之差度了。</p>
<p>開戰第一個月所需戰費之　測額。</p>
<p>（註一）Reichs　Archiv　Kriegsnustung　And　Krieg</p>
<p>（註二）E.　R.　A.　Seligman,　Essas　in　taxation</p>
<p>由於此表，我們又可得到如下的結論：</p>
<p>第一：戰費的推算，亦隨推算時期之變化，而成數學級數　增加。</p>
<p>第二：戰爭開始初期的費用，雖較以後各時期爲低。但這是需在短時期內，立即大量文出的。故有緊急支出之稱。依照歐戰中各國的應付方法，此項費用，大部份靠着銀行借欵。</p>
<p>第三：戰局展開之後，戰費的需要額便逐　增加。他的趨勢，也依數舉級數而遞增。</p>
<p>第四：當戰爭快將結束時。戰費的支出，必先突造一個最高額。如歐戰結束在一九一八年—一月，其時美國的戰費，平均每天達六千二百餘萬美元。超過了以前所有的紀錄。這種現象，大概是最後掙扎的表現罷。</p>
<p>「五」戰中每兵日費之發展與推算</p>
<p>如果用第三種方法，推算未來戰爭中每名兵十所需的戰費額，則今昔的差額，當然也有極大的不同。</p>
<p>歐戰之前，曾有人估　，每名兵士一日所需的戰費，的美金二元五角。（註三）又有人估計，每名德國兵，一日所需之戰費爲六馬克。（註四）這是二十世紀初葉時代的眼光。但歐戰發生之後，此項佔計，　成問題。因爲歐戰初期，各國每日消耗的戰費，如英國即達九百五十萬美元；德國與英國相近；法國雖較爲低些，但也需八百五十萬美元。至戰爭最高潮時，則其每日費用之鉅，允爲驚人。如英國已增至三千三百二十五萬美元，法國增至一一千一百萬美兀。德國且超過英國的費用，而達三千四百二十五萬美元。至於美國，則爲數尤鉅：參戰最初二月個，即日需一千五百萬美元。一年之後，增至五千萬美元。在一九一八年未期，且達六千四百二十五萬美元。（註五）</p>
<p>根據各國各時期每日支出的戰費，加以平均；而後以各該國動員的人數除之，便可獲得各國兵士，每人每日所需戰費的標準額　。現在我們根據、種統計材料，同時用上述的方法計算，其結果如下：</p>
<p>（註）表中　根　Seligman,　Essays　in　taxtion第二十四章·單位美金千元·　根據日本大藏省臨時調查局編歐洲大戰之戰費及財源要覧·單位日金千元·　根據E.　Comerfurd　統計·參看張一凡列強軍縮外交戰門史第二章·世界書局出版·單位一萬人</p>
<p>（註三）Bogart,　war　costs　and　their</p>
<p>（註四）同上</p>
<p>（註五）eligmap,前書</p>
<p>依寒氏數字推算·戰時每名兵士日費最大的是美國，計需美金九元三角。最低是奧國，只一元二角。平均爲每人每日的需二元·較戰前推算大五分之一。</p>
<p>依日本數字推算，戰時每名兵十日費最大的也是元國，計需日金十五元八角。最小的是意國，只二元六角。平均爲每人每日的需五元七角。然另據日人下材宏，以戰地上的各國兵士平均搶軍，每人每日的需日金十五元七角。（註六）　與寒氏數字推算而得者相差無幾。</p>
<p>「六」未來的瞻望</p>
<p>各項淮算的數字，雖是絕不一致；但是他們的結果，都表示着一律倍增的趨勢。以今日軍隊裝備的高度化，及軍械消耗力的劇烈化，那末未　戰爭的規校，必較歐戰大。未來所需的戰費，必較歐戰高。依照我們如下的推算，戰費的增加率，將達九倍之上。</p>
<p>第一：我們先以最近各國的軍事預算，興歐戰師的軍事預算，互相比戰；扣除其間物價上的影響。所得的結果，就是在平時的軍費，已較　增　了多少？答案就在上表中展開了</p>
<p>（註）戰前之軍費材料，根據國聯之調査報。皆决算數字。</p>
<p>今日之村料，皆根據各國財政部之發表。英日兩國係一九三六年預算。參看一九三六年版日文世界往何處去。</p>
<p>單位一律以各國本位幣一千計算。</p>
<p>物價指數材料根據甘本同盟通信社調査，參看　書。</p>
<p>由於此種對　，我們獲得幾點重要的論據。</p>
<p>各國今日的軍學費，一律比歐戰前暴增。日本法國都增加了十倍。意國增加了五倍。美國增加了四倍。英國增加了二倍左右。平均一律增加了三倍又五分之一。</p>
<p>今日各國的物價，較戰前漲起的有意日美三國，此外皆跌落。照理，物價與預算　增加率相等，則質的軍費並未增加。如果物價跌而電費反漲，則實質的軍費增加者尙不止此數。</p>
<p>意國的物價較前大了的三倍。軍費雖增五倍，實則只增二倍。</p>
<p>日本的物價較前只增了一倍又二分之一弱；軍費增加了十倍。故扣除了物價的影響，其實質增加者至少有八倍又二分一强。</p>
<p>美國的物價較前僅增一倍又五分之四，可是軍費却增四倍，故實增二倍又五分之一。</p>
<p>法英二國的物價皆　，但其軍費　增。法國物價跌落了十分之三；　軍費却增加十倍。刖他的實質軍費，增加率尙不止十倍。</p>
<p>英國的物價是跌洛了百分之五又八；故其軍費實際增加尙不止二倍。</p>
<p>（註六）日本東福一等主計調査。</p>
<p>如果把各國軍費增加中，扣除了物價的影響，則其純增加的平均數，便是叫倍。平時的軍費已純增加了四倍，由平時轉到戰時，他的費用自然又要相當的大增。不妨就用一個較小規模的戰爭爲例。</p>
<p>在二十世紀初葉的日俄戰爭，據日本東福一等主計調査：臘當時每一日兵每日費用，平時只要日金八角，戰時便要二元四角。（註七）這就是戰時的費用，要比平時大三倍把。這半時的增加倍數，加以這戰時增加的倍數，結果便是七倍。則未來戰爭的戰費，將比歐戰時還要大七倍。</p>
<p>此外，軍隊裝備的加强，軍械消耗力的擴大，還也是使戰費增加的主要原素。以英美日法意五强的平時陸軍總人數說，已由一九一四年的一九一八千人增至一九三二年的二一四四千人。海軍軍艦的總動力，也由二八一七萬馬力增至四〇三四萬馬力。大致都增加一倍。（註八）至於軍械消耗力的加强，情形允爲劇烈。在上述時間內，法國步兵師團的機關槍發射力，每分鐘由七二百發增至七九八百發。步槍的發射力，也由每分鐘的五六千發增至九五千發。砲兵一師團的發射力，也由每分鐘的三·九噸增至一四·五噸。過去大型的飛機，至多載炸藥六百噸；現在已增至八千噸。（註九）這種技術愈進步，他的消耗力也愈犬；同時他本身的生命也愈短。這不特無限地增大了基本經費，並且也增大了他的純消費。這樣，我們即使把這種經費的增加，統扯爲比歐戰時大二倍；則連前者便成九倍了。換一句話說：那就是未來戰費比上次還要大九倍。如果扣除其平時軍費的增加率，而求其純戰費的增加率，則也需五倍。</p>
<p>「七」試算我們自己的怎樣</p>
<p>假使這種推算不錯，即進而來試算我們自己的情形。如果我國一旦投人戰渦，則大體上需要多少戰費？而最主要的，需要準備多少緊急經費？試由下述的程序中求個簡單的答案：</p>
<p>根據我國陸軍新餉定額標準，（註十）士兵　每月薪餉，平均的十四元弱。則每人每日在平時只需四角七分。（食糧服裝及軍械之消耗　皆在外）依日兵在日俄戰爭的經騐，由平時轉變到戰時，其費用需增三倍。則每人每日所需之戰費共計一元四角一分。</p>
<p>根據我國政府向國聯報吿之數字，我國現役士兵人數，在民國二十年份，共有一，六二四，二八二人（官佐在外）。假定戰時不增加算，則以一元四角一分計，每日共需戰費一·二九〇，二三八元。第一個月便需六八，七〇七，一四〇元。但依申報年鑑二十三年版所列全國各師及獨立旅團營等個數加以統計，則我國現役士兵人數，辛少爲二，二五一，三三九人。如依穆卿在戰爭與經濟一文中所統計，歐戰時俄德法英四國動員之武力人數共有一二，六四〇，〇〇〇人；而戰前僅二，八六〇，〇〇〇人則戰時動口人數，將較半時增加四，四二倍。如依此情形，而將我國現役人數二百二十五萬餘人倍之，戰時將有九，九五〇，八九一人，則每日所需戰費一四，〇三〇，七九一元·第一個月伸需四二〇，九二三，七二〇元。一個月的支出，而僅以士兵所消耗者，已將等於民二十三年席國家總槪算的全額二分之一，如冉以官佐加入，並配備以最新式之軍械，而企圖作現代化之戰爭，則其戰費，即以全年之總歲入充一日之戰事，顯然尙非易事。</p>
<p>按各國的經騐，動員令下後一個月內，其所需之軍隊動　費，作戰動員費，海軍戰備費，軍需動員費，空軍戰備費，以及各部之緊急費等等，至少要抵戰爭初期一個月戰費的總額；這在動員令頒發的同時，就要立即支付的。所以需要事前有所準備。則在我們寅吃卯糧的今日之財政狀態下，用何種方法才能準備呢？這是大家應該精心細慮急起直追的問題了。</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>非常　期的警號，從華北走私的猖獗，與背景的强鄰陰謀感覺到國家整個財政之被破壊，席　我　腴的華北原野，而把持經濟的開發權。允其是華北紡織業和棉業區的併呑計劃，最足驚心　我民生衣被所需，勢將被其箝制，所謂非常時期的來臨，已間不容髮了！</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞的亡！是亡在硬性的武力侵略之下。今强鄰的對我，是以武力侵略爲經，以經濟侵略爲緯，雙管齊下，實行一元化的對華外　政策，亦即一貫的大陸邁進政策。華北經濟權的喧賓奪主的種種經濟侵略組織之有武人參加，商業軍事化，軍事商業化，打成一片，處心積慮，無非要奪得政治經濟的實權，危殆中的吾國紡織業，更遇到非常的襲擊。</p>
<p>華商紡織廠的現狀</p>
<p>我國紡織廠環境的艱苦，人盡知之。據豫晋·　·陜·四省紡織經營聯合會嚴　祥君談，「我國現在紗廠統計有四，五〇〇，〇〇〇錠，外商紗廠佔一，五〇〇，〇〇〇錠，華的商三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇錠，但近年受外商之傾銷，與華紗銷路之呆滯，因而停工者，已達一，　〇〇，〇〇〇錠，其餘　二百餘萬錠，亦均在杌隍掙扎狀况下，勉維現狀，如再不謀救濟辦法，恐將同歸倒閉，外紗銷路遍於全國，」云云。……然而天津有歷史，有地位的寳成寺四大紡織廠，因負債的過鉅，而淪洛在外商之手了。</p>
<p>紡織廠與金融業的經濟關係</p>
<p>華商紡織廠，自一二八後，歷年衰洛，誠以洋紗傾銷甚烈，而銷紗區域，除兩廣　滇外，幾盡被排擠。更以國內水旱頻仍，農村購買力銳减，存貨呆積，又苦於重利的負　，停錠，停工，日有所聞，於是固定資產的房地產，機器與流動資產的花，紗，布，等……多向銀錢業抵押凈盡。單就中國銀行二十四年度營業報吿所載關於工業放欵，較二十三年份，增加白分之一〇·八八，合全市金融計之，當史可觀。工業中的紡織廠，當史佔金融業投資　象中一個很重要的地位，所以紡織廠與金融業的經濟關係，更形密切。</p>
<p>非常時期的紡織廠措置</p>
<p>吾，紡織廠的大本營，幾　集中於沿　岸，戰爭幼發，首受　脅。壽屆時敵人以龐大軍　，封鎖我各海口，如上海，靑島，天津……，遮斷我興國際間商務的交通綫，鐵為橫行天空，燬我衣被所需及經濟命脈的工，商，金融　　心，有所難免。那麽如何維持工廠生命的厚料，使之不缺；如何訓練工人與凖備工餉，　得充分，這許多待决的條件，如果當槍林彈兩之衛，再夾籌劃，勞有所不能。關於此點，我國紡織專家朱仙舫，朱公樣兩先生，曾各有文字主張，頗可借　，亦爲筆者所欲言。</p>
<p>舫先生的主張：</p>

<p>吾國文物之盛，向爲各邦人士所稱羨，惜無大規模之博物院以資觀摩，而私人收藏，尤多不肯公開陳列，歷代文物，乃湮而不彰。此次中華文物展覺會，徵集珍品二千餘件，在滬西靜安寺路舉行展覽以來，博得好評不少。中有風與盪樣一事，尤饒興味，爰爲考證而記述之。</p>
<p>盪樣者，模型也。陳列之鳳輿盪樣，高約六七寸，闊的七八寸，製造之精細，比例之嚴整，與予曩年所目覩者，雖覺具體而微，而無亳釐之差，今日觸目興懐，覺當年帝干服御之莊嚴，猶縈人腦海間也。</p>
<p>慈禧皇太后奉安陵寢之時，鑾儀鹵薄，極人世生榮死哀之大觀。當年泰晤士報記者，目擊盛况，乃擬之爲唐之武后。（見該報一九〇九年十一月二十七日北京電訊）該報又稱：慈禧金棺奉安東陵時，初以八十四人抬之，以後加至一百二十人。儀仗中計有黃輿三乘，滿繡龍鳳，皆須於陵前焚之；喪費支出計一百二十五萬兩之多。其回喪時，舉行神主入廟大禮，一切尤極隆重。神主所御之黃輿，華麗奪目，所經之路，稱爲神道。旣近京城，監國攝政王，率領各王公大臣，跪接郊迎，過正陽門，入大淸門以至太廟，敬安於九帝三十五后之列云云。</p>
<p>上述回喪所用之黃輿，事前按例由內務府盪樣，進呈御覽，輿方六尺六寸，高七尺八寸，全輿金繡黃緞，頂係金葉所製，共九十九鳳，併神主而爲白鳳，槓亦金漆雲彩，極富麗堂皇之至，此輿與慈禧生前所用者無異。賚座四週，除香花供奉外，羅列茶菓點心，唯座前之金爐，係回喪時所特設平時無之。抬輿者，爲鑾儀衛訓練有素之侍衛夫役，故平穩舒適，實過於「羅斯勞安斯轎車Rolls　Royes惟速率不逮耳。濮蘭德慈禧外紀，謂慈禧長途旅行，常在輿中假寐，足見乘輿安適之一斑，恐維多利亞（辜鴻銘譽慈禧之稱）當日，亦無此享受也。慈禧生前窮極奢華，死後風光顯赫，鳳輿其一事耳。表而出之，亦足補「御香縹緲錄」之遺乎？</p>

<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>中國自有電影以來，就有偵探影片的攝製，但是爲了環境關係，終逃不出公案小說的羈絆，時常要帶些武俠和神怪的色采，或者像舞臺劇最力於布景機關，這當然是幼稚的設計。</p>
<p>有人曾向偵探小說作家程小靑氏問道，爲什麽你的小說裏的偵探霍桑，要稱爲中國福爾摩斯呢？他說，假使把偵探寫成帽子三七戴，玄色長衫，凸肚皮，　指頭，和馬路俠客一般，精神形式都覺得减色了。况且偵探是基於科學的，更應用一種簇新的姿態來演出，方有精采。</p>
<p>寫於小說的如此，映於銀幕的何嘗不如此，因爲電影的　性，比小說更濃烈。</p>
<p>明星影片公司在去年攝製過一部「翡零馬」是中國有聲偵探片的始創者，無論在寓言上，有拒毒的嚴正的啟示，就是　藝衛，也得到相當的成功。這回導演徐欣夫繼續努力，父攝製了一部『金銅鑽』是對着現在　於極重要的地位的走私問題。有一點抨擊，所以意識是不亞於翡翠馬的重大，而他第二部的造就，有兩點是値得稱許的：一是小動作的運用得法；一是舊科　的　止。關於前者，我們覺得在極緊張的局面中，常有極靈活的穿挿，不是舶來品的偵片，專門以恐怖離奇，使觀衆受到極度不安　的刺激。關於後者，並沒有　打亂追的鏡頭，沒有不合理的地穴密室之類沒有引起人反感的過情的失敗，所以我們看看金鋼鑽以後，深信中國的偵探片，是有着光明的前途的。</p>

<p>惟「克淋儂」一藥，極合實際治療淋病之特效藥，考其藥理，乃由於一種特殊之蛋白體，及動植物之類脂肪，經科學的手續，凈化製成，爲複方黃色素製劑之傑出者，對於治淋，有極妥速之偉騐，而全無副作用並霜烈刺激，性格純良，以此混充贋鼎甚多，故購服時切勿因聽他人言而購廉價雜牌劣藥。致服後危及生命，切宜認請「克淋儂」三字爲要。本劑旣爲蛋白體療法之一査Reruiz氏之實騐，治療淋性睪丸炎，於數日內卽見腫痛消失，本劑之藥效，固極顯著，故男女患者，不論急慢性及攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等，服此可獲全效，永保不發，實執近世，淋藥之牛耳者也。</p>

<p>纏綿的白帶，爲女子最痛苦之病”當此病之來也，無分晝夜，白液物涓涓從　部而出，遇心疲體倦，及月經到臨之前，此白液物更多，下部陰濕，糜爛生瘡，影響月經不調，小腹膨脹，此病惟一有效之處置，卽用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，每晚取一片納入陰道深部。次晨洗去。因此片善能消炎制止分泌，抗淋殺菌平創之功，故能奏效神速。惟患者如係丈夫淋病傳染，用此法療治外，可內服「克淋儂」以凈除血中之毒素。因體虛而來者，可內服「補女容」以强健其身體，而杜其病源，如是收效史速，愈後照常生育，是「卡而雪地氏陰道片」者，實婦女帶下藥中之巨　也。</p>

<p>肺癆之患者，恒見皮膚蒼白，煩躁，營養不良，盜汗，不思睡眠，顏面潮紅，咳嗽喀痰，測體溫，午前無熱，午後有三十七度餘之微熱。如上之徵候旣著，山是貧血，衰弱，脫力，體重日輕，熱度漸高，咳日加劇，痰益增多，時混血痰，或大量之喀血，胸痛，食慾缺乏，呼吸困難。遂呻吟於病床。如肺癆初期失其治療，關係生命匪淺，對於藥物療治，歷來甚少確效。近年雖盛行鹽化鈣，然注射回數甚多，患者多厭其煩，及法郞府內服「補肺拿爾」之製劑出，其施用之簡便，與奏效之確實，則遠駕他藥之上，蓋此爲鹽化鈣之複方製劑，乃自療之內服專藥。其於肺結核病灶，能發生食菌結締織之增殖及包圍等，以補足自然治愈。且其補力特强，超過魚肝油之治效。故於肺病衰弱，現卓越之藥理作用。服後咳痰立减，血止神增，體重加磅，食慾昂盛。因之所有前述各症，卽可瘳平。又木劑因善於除痰鎮咳，故爲呼吸器其他疾患之對症良藥，而百日咳，傷風，哮喘，久咳頑痰，得此卽安。年來臨床醫師，均喜採用本劑，收效殊速，而性質和平，毫無副作用，肺癆瘦弱者甚爲相宜。普運患有肺癆，多見腦神經衰弱，失眠心悸，眩暈腰痠，在婦女並有月經不調，可於進服本品外，同時兼服「補女容」調經補血，男子兼罹遺精腎萎，可同時餌服「補體康」固精補腦，則身强力壯，重入康莊。</p>

<p>攝護腺炎之累</p>
<p>淋毒性攝　　腺火，為淋病中最易續發者，以余歷年臨床上之經騐，凡百分中之九十以上，皆續發攝護線炎，其原因由於生理上部位關係，首當其衝也。不論急性慢性，攝護腺炎總是一種痛苦危險之症狀。原因有如下述。</p>
<p>本來我人生育上主要成分，厥為精子與攝護腺液二種，無精子固然不能生育，但有精子而無攝護腺液，亦猶如魚失水，精子因失其活動之要素，卽耗涸而死。所以攝護腺炎，初起雖是一種極尋常之淋病，但結果恒失去生殖力，患者除易感痛苦外，便是排尿困難，排出之尿，細小而疼痛，因其排尿困難，故有尿意頻催，膀胱蓄尿，小腹脹痛，若遷延失治，遂成攝護腺漏，腺液傷耗，而為不孕之主因。余對此症，除行手術外，更補以適常之內服藥，不論急慢性之攝護腺炎，均可按期治愈。余所用之手術。為振動按摩法，及抗淋血淸與電氣療法，內服淋病特效藥，以消炎鎭痛，淸濾血中毒素。往往於最近期內生痊。愈後仍能照常生育，惟巳結婚者，妻子所染之白帶，往往下部腐爛，小腹脹痛，小便艱苦，月經困難，除內服淋病特效藥外，其腔內必須陰道片以滌淸白帶。未幾亦治愈云。</p>
<h3 id="c216">淋病藥中之　抗毒與透膜殺菌 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>淋菌乃一極活潑而富頑抗力之細菌，且最易繁，當其初在我人生殖器部分，不過僅創口或粘膜上少許而巳。但不過二三日或三四日，卽繁殖至難以數計之淋菌，於是開始作破壊人體之工作，而其工作之表現，卽初期淋病症狀是也。其後愈演愈凶，益難收拾，苟非施以適當之醫療，遂漸而成爲慢性，此時淋菌由淺部到達深部，外表症狀，雖似平靜下去，而蘊藏之危險亦更深矣。以言治療，自亦更難。</p>
<p>「克淋儂」一藥，爲淋藥中最後成功者，兼有其他各藥之長，而無其他各藥之副作用。良以此藥質地純凈，具透膜殺菌防腐之力甚强。並能旺盛全身之抗毒素，以淋菌所藏身之地，多爲粘膜上，「克淋儂」旣有透膜殺菌之力，故對於各期淋病，如攝護腺炎，後尿道炎，精囊炎，精系囊，睪丸炎等，均能予以有力之追剿而治愈之。又因服此藥後，本身更能發出一種抗毒素，故雖十分活潑而富頑抗力之淋菌，亦難逃「克淋儂」所制伏也。因此「克淋儂」遂爲淋病藥中之特效藥。歐美各邦，久已風行，而吾國償用者亦與日俱增云。</p>

<p>療法方面，念性時宜服用胃之消毒助化劑，慢性時除用此法外，並須供給營養與壯奮胃作，可則奏完美之效果，査胃藥汗牛充棟，其經歐洲著名醫師，臨床實騐所賞用者，厥惟法郞府之「强胃精」，效力獨著，因本藥係酵　之綜合方劑，含有維他命ABD故不僅善療胃病，尤能根除因缺少維他命B而起之脚氣症，又普通酵酹劑均不含營養原之鹽類，爲效是以不足，獨「强胃精」富含此種營養上之營養鹽，與酵母作用混合，相得益彰，遂大顯其昂進食慾，補給營養之功能。以之作常年補品，最爲有益，胃病之噯氣呑酸，飲食見畏，胸部嘈雜，食後脹痛，嘔吐等，及腸鳴腹瀉，空屁珠放，大便秘結，得本劑即可迎刃而解。且以藥中富有蛋黃素，用於戒煙甚爲相得。</p>

<p>足下覺體倦無力乎？</p>
<p>內分泌爲生命之要素，故內分泌腺，亦爲吾人之生命線。我人內臟各部，均有腺囊，以爲分必液體用。此即內分泌也，其最著者為生殖腺，甲狀腺等。此等腺囊所分泌出之液體，即輸入血管，而血夜之生產量因得此重液體之剌　，遂促進其生產量。故精血兩旺，體健培增，精神明爽，如此等內分泌機能一旦失常，則精血兩衰，精神困頓，體倦思眠，而入夜反呈虛性興奮，往往頭痛失眠，腰痛脚軟無力。行步遲鈍。復又繼之以遺精，早洩等患，於是健康喪失無餘。而最能損害內分泌機能者，厥爲靑春發育期之誤犯手淫，與夫早婚房事過度而起。</p>
<p>梅倫氏因鑒於內分泌機能衰退者日衆，乃悉心研究耗三十餘年之心血，卒發明男用「補體康女用「補女容」二藥。其原料採自少壯期勇健動物體內之荷爾蒙而成。凡男女服此二藥後，即能調整人體內分泌機，故能促生新血球及新精液，凡男子遺精，早洩，勃起力不堅，女子月經不調，乳臀發育不全，及男女兩性早熟早衰，精神不振，四肢無力，頭目眩晕，心悸健忘，及久婚不孕等，服此藥數盒後，立見精神振刷，血色滿面諸病悉去，恢復固有靑春時代之健康，故「補體康」「補女容」二藥，早已不脛而走，全球男女兩界，莫不爭相購服，以却病健身云。</p>

<p>— 翔</p>
<p>擁有世界最廣大的讀者，不僅是蘇聯的，且是世界的文學巨人馬克星·高爾基，已於本月十八日，在蘇聯逝世了。這是世界的一件大事。全世界的讀者羣衆，從此再不能看到這位人類斛放之慧星的更偉大的創作了。</p>
<p>高爾基之被介紹到中國來，已有好多年。在中國一開始它就獲得了廣大的讀者羣衆。它的每一分鐘的脈膊的躍動，和呼吸的進行，和我國廣大的讀者羣衆，是相通的。不僅在中國是如此，在世界其他各地，都是如此。它整個的肉體與精神，已被溶化在世界受壓迫羣衆的血液之中。它之所以成為世界數萬萬被壓迫羣衆唯一的慰藉者，勉勵者，就是因為它其實已變成了各個讀者自己。</p>
<p>高爾基此刻是世界廣大讀者羣衆所擁戴的一個偉大作家，可是他的人生的開始，是非常悲慘，也可說是內容極為豐富的。也就是這非常悲慘與內容極為豐富的人生，才造成了它今日的偉大。它一生之中，進過正式學校讀書，前後不到一年。此後它就長時期在流浪生活中度過其可貴的靑春時代。它曾做過鐵路工人，鞋匠，麵包師等等。在這長時期內容極為複雜的流浪生活中，它很深入的觀察了社會各階層的具體形式，作為它後來許多偉大作品產生的泉源。它之自學成功，從非常悲慘的人生中，建立起了，它今日在世界文壇上的權威，這差不多是現世界中的一個奇蹟！此刻正陷在和它非常悲慘相同生活中的我們，對於它之從極艱苦的境地奮鬥成功，在此刻追悼它的時候，我們應該怎樣以最大的熱誠，去接受它遺留給我們這最偉大最可寶貴的敎訓啊！</p>
<p>大革命前夜的俄羅斯帝國，在動亂的社會中，跳躍着革命火燄的氣候中，創造了一個偉大的人類解放之掌號者，光照着過去的俄羅斯，和現在的羅聯，向着整個世界放出迫人的光芒。我們現在正臨到一個什麼天氣。我們需要一個偉大的發吼者，出現在現在的中國！</p>

<p>— 戴離</p>
<p>是秋深的黃昏，瓦格涅夫斯獨個兒在靜寂的拉斐德路上走着。他雙手揷在那灰色的夾大衣口袋裏，頭兒埋得低低地，邊傾聽他那沙沙的步聲，邊他一步一步地踱着。</p>
<p>南中國的十月，本來還够不上聖彼得堡的初秋，這是多麼美麗而舒適的一個季節！然而好像氣候也變了，他感覺到達聖彼得堡的嚴冬也沒有現在這樣的寒冷。一陣秋風吹過，就像千萬支笛子從零落將盡的樹巔，從街的盡頭處吹起來一般，他不覺打了一個寒禁，伸出手來把衣領再扶高些。他捫着那早已毛起來了的大衣，心裏就猛然地沉下去，「像這樣的季候便這樣凉，到了冬天呢？所有的衣服不是早上出門時全都穿上來了麼？」這想頭，又僚起了他無時不紆迴在腦際的另一個問題來——</p>
<p>「十五年了，十五年！生活呢？生活呢？」他迷惘了，似乎是永不會得到答案似的。當初，他還想到「究竟什麼時候才能回到聖彼得堡？才能到冬宮裏參加那華貴的跳舞會？」而現在，這想頭已不知從什麼時候擘開了他，他似乎連想一想的勇氣也被剝奪了。</p>
<p>「媽的，臭雜種，布爾塞維克」！他不覺低聲罵起來，狠狠地吐了一口水。</p>
<p>馬路似乎是永遠走不完的一般，脚下也無時無刻不沙沙地響着。街燈已經亮了，霞飛路的酒排間飾窗上那奪目的霓虹燈，就像妖艷的女人的眼睛，這使他想起了濃郁的瓦爾加酒來，他似乎聞到那酒香，不覺咽了幾口水。</p>
<p>紳士依然安詳地走着，似乎沒有聽到那哀求一般。經騐告訴瓦格涅夫斯基，要求着幾個銅板，幸運點就是一張破爛的角票，還要再走幾步路的。</p>
<p>他不吝惜那不值錢的話語同脚步，緊緊地追隨着。</p>
<p>「先生，太太，給我幾角錢吧，上帝祝福你呵，先生……」</p>
<p>鐺的一聲，一把銅子從紳土的手裏瀉了下來。</p>
<p>就在這時候，蹲在步道邊的小癟三們眼睛馬上亮了。他們擁着一起跑過來，伸手檢起地上的銅子。</p>
<p>瓦格涅夫斯基的臉脹紅了，　子的靑筋綻現出來，他揮起拳頭追打那些小孩，但追走了那一個，另一個又跑回來，畢竟小孩子人多，他們檢完了銅子，便站在對過的步道上哈哈地笑起來。</p>
<p>瓦格涅夫斯基氣得直抖，眼眶也潤濕了。他像發狂一般，兇猛地撲過去。他們互相追逐着，咀駡着。</p>
<p>「哈，看這羅宋癟三！」</p>
<p>看看小孩子們漸慚走遠了，漸漸溶在遠處的黑暗中。瓦格涅夫斯基才醒轉過來，握緊着拳頭，用生硬的上海話罵起來：</p>
<p>「猪玀！戳那娘個×！」</p>
<p>一陣秋風又從那處吹來，他像作了一個噩夢，兩顆寂寞的淚珠在微光下閃動起來。</p>
<p>街上很寧謐，時不時有一二部電車轟隆轟隆開過來，駛過去。明亮的街燈給他拖了一條瘦長的影子。他挺了挺胸脯，又把給油垢沾汚了的領帶理緊些，邁着步子走過去。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>他淸切地看見路兩旁的住家，每一個敞開的或嚴閉着的窗子都瀉出了一股銀色的燈光，他聽到那裹男人們，女人們，小孩們的笑聲，也許他們正在舒服地吃着晚餐，桌上擺着鮭魚同燒鵝，他又聞到濃烈的咖啡香……這一切，就像執刑的人們手中的鞭子，無情地抽擊着他，壓服了他的自尊心，使他重新沉下頭去，連口哨也忘記吹了。</p>
<p>遠處，有一對紳士出現了。也許是上戲院裏去，也許是作着晚飯後的散步，他們的步伐是那樣整齊。那男人扶着女的，低低地在絮語着，瓦格涅夫斯基忽忙走上去，跟在他們的身邊，用乞憐的聲音說：</p>
<p>「先生，太太，我還沒有吃中飯呢！請……」</p>

<p>— 致敏</p>
<p>從南國流浪歸來，住在朋友家裏過了冬天還是失業着。朋友是一個洋行寫字間裏的小職員，每月二十五元的進欵是祇能免强數衍他的單獨生活。現在多了我一個吃閑飯的，兩個人的生活都發生了恐慌。雖然我們的友誼不在乎大家過再困難的生活的，不過見了朋友蒼白的臉，時常愁苦的樣子，心裏總覺得不安。幾乎每天像一個淘金者一樣，耐着性子向各方面去探求甚至是祇要有膳宿供給的職位，但是每天帶着一張失望的臉回來，反使朋友用那種做作的好話來安慰我，我眞是太帶害了我的朋友了。</p>
<p>於是我開始注意到報紙上的聘請欄，從自己的經騐，朋友們的講述，對於那些動聽的廣告詞句，我是知道得很多的。但是終於硬起頭皮來去應徵一個小學校的敎員職位了。因爲廣吿上註明是要半盡義務的，供給膳宿之外，祇有數元車馬費，讀到那廣吿的時候，覺得對於我目前的情形是很有希望的。</p>
<p>我照着廣吿上的地址，在閘北一個小弄堂裏找到了那所學校。是石庫門房子，站在大門口就能望見懸着黨國旗的敎室，按本地人的習慣，那敎室是呌做客堂的。對於這種情形，我們窮朋友又是知道得很多的，祇要課桌，黑板沒有短少，上海有的就是那類學校。我沒有打招呼，逕踏進天井裏，一個穿短褲，跟着拖鞋的中年人剛在角裏小便，不知是否我的樣子很合乎那種小學的敎員，他衝口問我是見了廣吿的嗎？他那種不敬的態度是稀有的，很使我不高興。我微微點了點頭，也很隨便地回答他我要見這裏的校長。</p>
<p>「很好！很好！」他提着褲子招呼我就是這里的校長。」</p>
<p>我本來是大模大樣坐了下來，他到敎室里，讓了坐，他自己介紹：「我就是這里的校長。」</p>
<p>我本來是大模大樣坐了下來，他旣是我將來的上司，不由地裝做了客氣的樣子馬上問他貴姓。</p>
<p>「敝姓劉，卯金刀。草字單名一個廣，廣大之廣」他忽然想起了什麽似的向後面喊了，一個我聽不淸楚的名字，一邊從短衫袋里掏出兩支爛縐了的捲烟，授給我一枝劃上火，他繼續着說：「我這學校已開設七年，學生很多，樓上還有三間敎室。一位老敎員有高就走了，他薦來的一位管理太嚴緊一點，學生的家屬時常到校里吵鬧，他們不願意送子弟到我們校里來了…</p>
<p>這一段歷史，彷彿一個說書先生似的他說得很順口，但是說到這里他突然停住了。剛巧一個校役模樣的人送茶出來，他親自接了茶杯送到我面前，笑着接下去說：</p>
<p>「先生是明白人，减少一個學生就是减少一份學費，所以我登廣吿想請一位像從前那位老敎員一樣的，嘻嘻，先生懂得我的意思嗎！」</p>
<p>自然我是完全懂得的，而且我知道得很多呢。我們一切談妥之後，我就詢問他廣吿上沒有說明的車馬費。</p>
<p>「這個…」他似乎沒有提防到這問題，思索了半嚮，伸着右手的食指，「學校實在窮，照從前的一樣，十塊錢，十塊錢。」</p>
<p>祇三天，就開學了。兩個人支配着梯。那些學生呢，到學校來彷彿進公園一樣，帶一點吃食，在敎室里嘰嘰吱肢地吵鬧，他們都是不要讀書的，最好每點鐘，簡直是每天講故事。而我們的劉廣校長好像是個故事專家，呆女壻，龍王做壽，薛仁貴征東他都會講。</p>
<p>他防我反對那種敎授法，對我說對付那些學生祇好馬馬虎虎，祇要他們高興，學費就有着落。去年那位就是不省馬虎，幾乎把學生都送走。</p>
<p>旣然進了講故事的學校，我也變做了說書先生，不過我販賣的是華盛頓，拿破侖，孫中山那類故事，因爲要對得起拿十塊錢一月的車馬費的。</p>
<p>到第三個月底，劉廣向我商量一費要過幾天付給。我旣沒有多大用處，答應了他。但是第四第五個月都是欠着，他說到學期終了一定全數付給，他正想一個辦法，下學期學生一定多起來。</p>
<p>到學期終了的前十天光景，他走了沒有回校，第二天有法警押着來搬課桌，我才知道劉廣已四個月沒有付房租，他自己逃了。結束了一學期的講故事生活，我又住在朋友家里來了。</p>

<p>當我聽到了仁患腸熱病的消息，便很焦急地跟琪說好，决定只要一空過來便一同到××醫院去看他。那曉得這樣一天挨一天地，都沒法抽得空到他那里，當時實在是很使我們疚心的尤其是一時空下來閒談中，提到了這樣一個無家可歸的靑年人，我們都爲之嘆息，和三番四覆地記憶他的故事。有一天，琪很早便忙了出去，嚮午時候他搖了一個電話回來！—</p>

<p>通知同事一聲也來不及地便跳上了公共汽車了。當時的忽忙，實在是沒有辦法再可以追述出來了，從來自己是很少這樣忘記一切的，這天大槪是聽了這消息太刺戟了的原故。到財政廳前，換了到東山去的汽車，才算稍爲安定了一下。這時候我記起了這一個沒有了祖國的年靑朋友，以及他這幾年來所遭遇的一切，我差不多變得神經質了。記得那不過是距離他病前一星期左右，我們還一同在弄一件很有趣的事。他的堅定的，固執的，剛强的說話到現在也還留在我們的腦海里不會忘記——永遠不會忘記的啊。然而，不過是幾天的事吧，一個粗壯的漢子給病纏着了，而且是那來勢很兇的腸熱症。跟着是他的妻子送他到醫院，和通知朋友，向朋友們募捐。這樣，不但我們那伴有趣的事完結了，便是我們的快樂也緞帶這病魔吞歿了。</p>
<p>車猝地停了。象什麽牽着我們的，兩步便跳下了車。一個很偉大，也很淸雅的建築物橫在我面前了，這象一個黑影沈重地壓在我的心胸，蓋上我的眼睛。我的心仍很焦燥，但我的脚步却變得慢了，直象一個送喪行列的隨行者一樣。在號房里通知一聲，便在樓梯那里拐了一個灣。樓梯是用一塊地毯誧上的，皮鞋走上去也沒聲音，而我却更過細地小心，脚步越發越發慢了，心頭重壓壓地透不過氣來。</p>
<p>「宗」！</p>
<p>一個很熟悉的聲音驚駭了我。象才我也不作盤，只用柔和的眼睛安慰她，意思是勸她不要太悲傷。然而，我的眼睛太蠢了，完全沒有功效反之却直象一個殘忍的劊子手一樣把她的悲哀引了出來。她滴着淚，說：</p>
<p>「宗，他沒有希望了。醫生說：如果他的溫度還不斷地增高的話，那便誰也不敢說。」</p>
<p>仁的堅定的，固執的，剛強的說話又象銅鈴一樣在我耳邊幌動着了。我殘忍地咬着自己的嘴唇，請求她陪我到病房里去看仁。</p>
<p>是三等病房。一個暗黑的狹小的房子，縱橫放着四床病床，便只留得側着身跑的過道。空氣很不好，嘔人的藥味我有點抵受不住。我疑惑着這决不會是不危險期病人所適宜的住房，但是老早我却巳聽說只有他才倖運搬到這類乎二等病房的病房來，否則，七八個人的大廂間却比這還嘔氣。</p>
<p>仁是躺在靠牆的病床上。他這時正熟睡。在雪白的蓋被所襯托着他的臉孔，蒼老而日黧黑，給熱度燒得漲紅，很憔悴，額上擱着用白布包着的水塊，替他减少少許難過。我們窒息着在這怕人的三等病房里，又不想驚醒他，又捨不得這樣地便離開子他。</p>
<p>一會兒，他的乾燥的唇張了幾下，也是乾燥的舌頭無力地在兩唇間舐了一會。跟着是喃喃地說着囈語：</p>
<p>「要命！害怕他的烏龜，大家跟他拼了這一次吧！來，來，只要我……」</p>
<p>我慌忙地有點失態，走上去用手掩着他的咀吧，我把都害怕他會把什未事也說了出來。寧願破壞了醫院病房的規矩，我們把他弄醒了。他很費力地睜大了眼睛，那失神的，死黃色的眼睛。我害怕看它，我忍受着一切痛苦的襲來。</p>
<p>「宗你？」</p>
<p>我凝視着他，他已很吃力，不能再繼續說下去。這時候，我忘記了我從前曾經詛咒過別人不應用謊話來騙一個垂死的人，我也這樣地開始講自己不願講的話了。</p>
<p>最后，琪拉了我離開了這怕人的三等病房。我們又走到馬路上來了。這時候我們的話題却轉向了埋怨那只能死人不能醫人的三等病房了。</p>
<p>過了幾天落雨的悶日子。一天的下午，仁的妻來了一個電話，簡單地像沒有一點悲哀地報吿我們：仁死了。</p>

Early risers saw that the corners of the streets in Jiaominxiang were blocked by Japanese soldiers. They had arrived from Fengtai and Tongzhou. The streets north of Jiaominxiang were also filled with Japanese soldiers, all marching in formation. Since the Boxer Rebellion, there has never been such a large concentration of foreign troops in this area. This was apparently due to Commander Kawabe's inspection and address to his brigade.

<h3 id="e11">Ambassador Kawagoe and Economic Cooperation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>It is appropriate</p>
<p>The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Kawagoe, has already arrived in Shanghai by ship from Kobe and is expected to arrive today. Mr. Kawagoe has served as a consul in various parts of our country and has a deep understanding of the Japanese garrison in North China. After the decision at the Japanese Tripartite Conference, he is taking office under the instructions of the government to strive to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. Can he break free from the past torment of dual diplomacy and create a new situation in diplomacy towards China?</p>
<p>According to his pre-departure remarks, Ambassador Kawagoe's diplomatic mission seems to focus on economic cooperation in North China. As for the specific plan, according to a report by the Allied News Agency a few days ago, it is divided into three items: first, economic and technical assistance for cotton cultivation; second, the development of mines such as coal and iron; and third, the construction of railways, starting with the Cangshi Railway. Although these plans have only now shown signs of materializing, they were actually decided by the Japanese authorities years ago. Japan is inherently a small country with "insufficient innate resources." As a result of industrial expansion in modern times, it has become increasingly aware of the lack of raw materials. After seizing the four northeastern provinces, it began to covet the rich resources of the North China provinces. Statistics show that the cotton production of Hebei and Shandong provinces accounts for 44% of the national production, and the coal reserves of Hebei and Shanxi provinces account for more than half of the national reserves. Cotton and coal are the two main raw materials that the Japanese industrial sector lacks the most. This is why the Japanese authorities are so interested in the development work in North China.</p>
<p>Ambassador Kawagoe's economic cooperation plan is related to the separatist movement in North China that the Japanese army is carrying out. Without discussing it in detail, only from the plan itself, this so-called cooperation is based on reciprocity, equality, and mutual respect for sovereignty, and will not destroy China's economic foundation. This is an important issue that concerns the foundation of the country and cannot be ignored. Our diplomatic authorities should give it careful consideration when negotiating.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Implementation Steps for Introducing Income Tax <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Revising and Drafting Various Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited Gao Bingfang, director of the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office, on the 21st to inquire about his opinions on preparing for the collection of income tax. Mr. Gao gave the following speech: Mr. Gao first stated that Vice Director Liang Jingchun and he had been ordered by Minister Kong to prepare for the central direct tax. The principle of introducing income tax has now been approved by the Central Political Committee and will soon be announced and implemented. Therefore, a decision has been made to start with planning the implementation of income tax collection. During the preparation period, the speaker planned to proceed in the following steps. Although the principle of income tax has been approved by the Central Political Committee, the income tax regulations still need to be formulated by the Legislative Yuan. At present, the speaker's office has drafted an income tax regulation bill and sent it to the Legislative Yuan for reference. In addition, the office plans to separately request revisions to various existing laws and regulations related to income tax, and to start drafting one by one the regulations required for income tax itself, so as to make them complete and facilitate implementation. Mr. Gao continued by saying that the future tax revenue performance of income tax has a great relationship with the accounting system. The principle of income tax passed by the Central Political Committee divides income into three categories: profit income, salary and compensation income, and securities and deposit income. The calculation and laws for collecting each type of income should deduct various expenses before taxing the income. How to formulate an accounting system that prevents tax collectors from enriching themselves and taxpayers from cheating is a matter that needs detailed research. Moreover, the nature of these three types of income is different, and each type of accounting system has its own characteristics. Individual research should be carried out to suit the facts. As for the collection method, it should also be classified and regulated. The surface seems very complicated and cannot be accomplished in one fell swoop. However, the three types of income that the Central Political Committee stipulates should be collected may be able to adopt the source taxation method to facilitate collection, or there may be new organizational structures to facilitate investigation. It does not require a long preparation time or a huge amount of investigation funds. Moreover, the bank income tax and income donation collected in the past are similar in nature to income tax, and there are even precedents to follow. As long as it is handled properly, it will be easy to achieve rapid results. Mr. Gao finally said that the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office now plans to invite national financial experts and scholars to jointly participate in the planning, in order to formulate a complete direct tax system based on China's economic environment, social organization, and people's livelihoods. As for how to set up income tax collection agencies in various provinces, it is still under consideration. It is said that Minister Kong attaches great importance to the introduction of income tax this time. They can only follow his instructions and handle matters carefully.

<p>(Tianjin) Li Shouxin's troops in northern Chahar extended the boundary to the Sihaiyan area of Yanqing County south of the Great Wall. Last week, eight pseudo-police officers were sent to the town to set up checkpoints, check household registrations, and collect donations. They clashed with the villagers and were beaten and fled. On the 19th, a Japanese plane flew to the town to investigate. That night, a Japanese company and a company of pseudo-Li Shouxin troops surrounded the entire town and bombarded it with fierce artillery fire. The entire town was reduced to rubble, and countless old and young were massacred. The villagers fled to Nanwan and Xigou villages. On the 20th, the Japanese and pseudo-troops resumed their pursuit to Hei Hanling Zhou Sigou, attempting to annihilate the residents. The old and young were scattered, and deaths were scattered along the way. Cattle fled to the valleys. A certain party ordered the Yanqing Security Team Feng Shoupeng and Luo Zizhen to block the Liu Binbao Yingpan Madao Ridge in order to achieve annihilation.

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese police station dispatched Da Rin, a Justice Department official, to the Gongli Hospital at noon on the 21st to interrogate Liu Guitang about the reason for the assassination. Liu received treatment and survived. He needs to be discharged from the hospital after two months. His old servant Xu is a major suspect and has already fled. (Special Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After Liu Guitang was assassinated, the Japanese military police searched hotels and brothels in the concession overnight but found nothing. On the morning of the 21st, Liu fainted and was in critical condition. He was resuscitated with a cardiotonic injection. The assassination occurred at 10:20 p.m. on the 20th, when two people claiming to be Liu's old subordinates knocked on the door of Liu's residence. The servant recognized one of them as Zhao, who had served as a commander under Sun Chuanfang and Liu. The servant was also familiar with the appearance of the other person, but could not recall his name. As the servant let them into the vestibule, Liu was watching the servants playing mahjong in the car room. The two assassins broke in and opened fire. Three bullets hit the left chest, and three bullets penetrated the lower left jaw. A servant was hit by a stray bullet in the shin. All fell to the ground. Because the gate was closed, the two assassins jumped over the wall and fled in a hurry. After Liu was admitted to the hospital, he lost too much blood and could not speak. The reason for the assassination is suspected to be a dispute over stolen goods among his old subordinates. Another theory is that someone bought off Liu's old subordinates to do it. After this incident, the ambitious and conspiratorial factions in the Japanese concession all fled to a certain military department for protection. (Special Dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Transportation instructed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, saying that it has recently been reported that many employees are still smuggling packages privately on Jianghai Ships. Since ships are a tool of the shipping business, all goods should be subject to the regular ship procedures for calculating and paying freight by piece, which is the proper procedure. If employees privately carry packages, both passengers and cargo on the ships will be affected, and employees will be committing illegal acts. Since smuggling in North China is quite rampant, the Ministry of Finance has formulated regulations to punish tax evasion, and the punishments are very severe. The crimes committed by ship employees who privately carry packages are no different from tax evasion. Severe punishments are necessary to stop this corrupt practice. The Ministry of Transportation, considering that the ship employees are not familiar with the laws and are used to old habits, does not want to punish without warning. It is providing detailed warnings in advance, urging you to immediately instruct the ship captains to make it clear to all, so that they can strictly comply. (Special Dispatch on the 21st)</p>

The temporary loan amount is 80,000 yuan, which will be managed by the Provincial Agricultural Cooperative Association. In addition, the Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance have revised the standards for tax reduction in various counties, as well as methods for surveying and reporting disasters, in order to alleviate the people's distress.

<h3 id="e37">Tribes in Western Abyssinia Still Resisting Italian Troops; Prepared to Defend Homeland at Any Cost; Rainy Season Hinders Italian Air Operations <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Cairo) A European officer in the Abyssinian army, who escaped from the capital before the Italian troops entered, arrived in Cairo this afternoon after traveling 500 miles through Sudan. The officer predicted that the Abyssinian army would continue to resist the Italian troops. According to the officer, the tribes in western Abyssinia had not been loyal to the Abyssinian king in the past. Now that the tribesmen see that their land, rich in gold, silver, and coffee, will be occupied by Italian troops, everyone is shocked and grieved. The people in the Galla region are now prepared to defend their homeland at any cost. The Abyssinian people in the west will now be led by General Mariam to resist the Italian troops' invasion. The troops of Generals Imru and Taistai are retreating from the northeast to the west in good order. At the same time, heavy rain has begun to fall, which the Abyssinian people believe will hinder the activities of Italian aircraft. If the Italian troops advance westward, the Abyssinian people will use guerrilla tactics to resist them. Furthermore, a report was recently received from Djibouti from responsible parties stating that the Italian troops have only occupied the main towns in Abyssinia. The vast majority of the land between these towns has not only not been captured by Italian troops, but is also openly resisting Italian rule. The Italian troops have not even attempted to penetrate the west and south. The organized government in the Galla region of the west, headed by Mariam, has been eliminated, and bandits have risen to take its place. There are also many places in the south that are in chaos. The Italian troops have only stationed scattered troops in the Gotgem Province. Even in the capital, gunfire is heard at night. Although the Italian troops have carried out many killings, they have not been able to intimidate the bandits, who still come out to rob from time to time. The population of the capital is now only one-tenth of what it used to be, with most having fled to join the chieftains still in the war zone. Although the Italian troops have repeatedly suppressed, burned villages, and killed people suspected of being involved in disturbances along the main road from the Abyssinian capital to Taissai, Italian convoys traveling on that road are still not safe. Therefore, the acting Abyssinian Governor General Graziani recently issued a proclamation stating that if the chiefs do not immediately stop causing disturbances, the Italian troops will annihilate them everywhere. At the same time, Abyssinian finances are in great chaos. The railway seems likely to become a major point of contention in the near future, as the railway station staff refuse to accept Italian lire (Italian currency) for the transportation of troops and materials.

<h3 id="e39">Baldwin's Speech Advocates Lifting Sanctions Against Italy; Only Way to Avert European War; Advocates Reforming the League of Nations and Promoting Disarmament <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin delivered a speech in Lanark yesterday, vigorously defending the British government's attitude of preparing to lift sanctions against Italy, saying that not doing so would only lead to war. He did not advocate taking this action, nor did he know if any country in Europe was prepared to do so. If the League of Nations were always a united association of all countries in the world, then this situation would never occur, because the strength of the member states, except for the aggressor, would be so superior that aggression would not be profitable. The first step in seeking peace through collective security is to increase war preparations, which is a painful irony of the overall situation. If Europe ever rekindles a fire, the spread of this wildfire would be unpredictable. He would not dare to take this risk while holding a little power in the government. The government cannot abandon the hope of bringing countries back to the League of Nations and establishing a practical form of disarmament. Baldwin then described the horrors of a new war for European revival, saying that the government has set a policy to consider how to deal with this issue in Geneva this autumn.</p>
<p>The administrative chairman of the Irish Free State, Eamon de Valera, spoke in Parliament on Friday, supporting British Foreign Secretary Eden's proposal to lift sanctions against Italy and enthusiastically supporting Eden's actions in the Italo-Abyssinian War, saying that the League of Nations' failure to implement an effective plan cannot be blamed on the Foreign Secretary. The people of France have already suffered enough from the European war. Should they not hesitate to consider actions that could lead to war? De Valera also asked those who advocated continuing sanctions whether they were willing to prepare for war. If they were not willing to do so, then they should not criticize those who sought to resolve conflicts and turn swords into plowshares with foresight. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Liberal Party held a conference yesterday and passed a resolution stating that it was ashamed and indignant to hear that the government was determined to surrender to the aggressor, betray the League of Nations, and disregard the promises made during the general election. The conference also reaffirmed its loyalty to the League of Nations Covenant, saying that if it were implemented bravely and unyieldingly, it would not fail. Today, various newspapers are discussing what procedures will be used to implement the British government's proposal to lift sanctions against Italy if Geneva accepts it. It is expected that the date of the lifting will be determined by the Sanctions Adjustment Committee and implemented jointly by the governments concerned. Daily news reports state that once a compromise is reached, an order to lift the sanctions plan will not be delayed for long. By mid-July, the sanctions may be completely lifted, and the United Kingdom will announce the lifting by Cabinet order in the same manner as when the sanctions were implemented.

<p>(New York) President Roosevelt's order issued on October 5 last year, prohibiting the transportation of war goods to Italy and Abyssinia due to the state of war between the two countries, has been lifted today by President Roosevelt. However, State Department officials clearly stated that the lifting of this embargo does not imply that the United States recognizes Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. This is a diplomatic issue that requires important consideration and will be decided at a later date. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued a directive today, revoking the US neutrality declaration announced at the beginning of the Italo-Abyssinian War. The United States has now officially recognized that the Italo-Abyssinian War has ended, but this does not mean that the United States recognizes Italy's sovereignty over Abyssinia. This is another issue that should be handled separately. Official explanations state that the President revoked the neutrality declaration because US observers in Abyssinia reported that the war had completely stopped. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e41">London Newspapers' Comments Express Dissatisfaction with the Government; Cowardice and Incompetence Are Undeniable <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(London) Following the debate on foreign policy in the House of Commons last Thursday (the 18th), newspapers continue to express dissatisfaction with the government, with even the Times and the Observer criticizing it. The Observer published an article by the renowned journalist Garvin, stating, "Our government is completely helpless in the face of European dictatorships. Its cowardice and incompetence are obvious. It is not an exaggeration to say that our country has become a country without a leader. However, our country still has the power to control Germany and Italy, and this is none other than financial power." The Times expressed dissatisfaction with the remarks made by former Prime Minister Lloyd George, the leader of the Liberal Party, in the House of Commons, and stated that "the real issue today is how to strengthen the League of Nations and not allow it to fail again. The greatest danger lies in the two principles of so-called 'indivisible peace and universality of the League of Nations'." (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Conservative Party right-wing leader Churchill recently gave a speech in the Essex constituency, discussing British foreign policy, stating, "What our foreign policy needs is a strong will." If those who hold the reins of government do not have this will, then the cabinet members will not know what to do and will find it difficult to fulfill their responsibilities. Churchill refuted the arguments made by Liberal Party leader Lloyd George in the House of Commons yesterday, stating, "Lloyd George accused the government of improperly abandoning Abyssinia without providing assistance, while also saying that Britain should not come to the aid of Austria if it is attacked by another country. His words are self-contradictory. Looking at the situation in Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, it is worse than it was a year ago. All countries with liberalism and democracy are currently experiencing a period of extreme weakness, while Germany is fully engaged in military buildup. Thinking of this, I cannot help but worry."

The Prime Minister concluded, "Do you also wish that the glory of the 200th anniversary will be greater than today?" The officers and soldiers immediately answered in unison, "We hope so!"

<h3 id="e44">Countries That Signed the Treaty of Lausanne Hold Meeting Today; Representatives from Nine Countries Attend to Discuss the Issue of Defending the Straits <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Mond, Switzerland: The countries that signed the Treaty of Lausanne, at the request of Turkey, are convening a meeting to discuss the issue of re-fortifying the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. The meeting is scheduled to open here at 4 pm on the 22nd of this month. Representatives from nine countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Soviet Russia, and Yugoslavia, will attend. The United Kingdom will be represented by the current Minister of Public Works, Lord Stanhope, the former Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and France will be represented by former Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, assisted by Ambassador to Turkey Ponsot. Italy, also a signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, was also invited to attend, but is expected to be absent in the early stages of the meeting. It is generally hoped that once the sanctions are lifted, the country will be able to send representatives to participate. The scenery here is beautiful and the environment is tranquil. In this early summer, when all kinds of flowers are in full bloom, it feels even more pleasant. It is recalled that before the Lausanne Conference was held in 1923, British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, former French Prime Minister Poincaré, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met here on November 20, 1922, to exchange opinions, and then signed the Treaty of Lausanne with Turkish representatives in the city of Lausanne the following year. The reason why this meeting is being held in this small town, rather than in the world-famous cities of Lausanne or Geneva, is because the city of Lausanne is opposed by Soviet Russia, and Geneva is opposed by Japan (a Soviet Russian named Vorovsky was previously assassinated in Lausanne, and Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations and does not want to hold meetings in Geneva). The Treaty of Lausanne was signed on July 24, 1923, stipulating that all merchant ships and warships, whether in peacetime or wartime, shall be free to navigate the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits, and no defenses may be set up on the shores of the straits or nearby islands. This is tantamount to imposing a military easement on Turkey, which is supervised by an international committee composed of the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne and the United States. This country has requested the lifting of the restrictions through peaceful and legal means, and it is expected to be satisfied, because the friendly atmosphere between the countries concerned is extremely strong, and they also trust each other, so there are no differences on this issue.

<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Olivar gave an interview to an Echo reporter yesterday to explain the current policy, stating, "There are two ways to solve the financial problem. One is the devaluation of the franc, which is a desperate and immoral solution. The only people who benefit from the drawbacks are speculators. The second is that France's viability is inherently rich and sound, and it must be stimulated. This is an optimistic solution. We have already made a choice between the two, and only confidence and health remain. The economic panic encountered by the United States was even worse than that of our country. The people of that country are now emerging from their plight, and they have been able to understand the way to achieve this. Why should the people of France be ignorant and pessimistic? You can ignore the alarmist rhetoric. On the contrary, you should continue to trust France and trust French doctors. It is not a good thing that these doctors do not advocate bloodletting or amputation, but use other methods to treat chronic diseases," and so on. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The rescue measures for the franc announced by French Finance Minister Oreval in the House of Commons have had a good impact. The prices of various gold coins rose this morning, but the financial community is reluctant to comment hastily because several key points are not yet clear. If the Blum government's plan had not failed, reducing the currency value would never have been tried lightly. Therefore, short sellers must engage in covering, and the franc can naturally turn around. A London banker told a Reuters reporter that the French Finance Minister is determined to fight to the end and will not reduce the currency value, because if he yields, the expectations of the French Socialist Party will be completely wiped out, and it may not be possible to recover in twenty years. As to whether the plan put forward by the French Finance Minister can remedy the financial panic he described, there are still many people who doubt it. A glimpse of the comment of the Times can be seen. The newspaper said that the case of the French Finance Minister making people report the money stored abroad may not reduce but will increase the outflow of funds, because hoarders are deeply worried that the government will even be engaged in finding out where the funds are before trying to balance the budget and put the currency on a more solid basis, so as to implement a method of requisition.

<h3 id="e47">France; Demonstrations by the Croix-de-Feu; Disturbances Continue in Various Places <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Since the government ordered the dissolution of various paramilitary groups, many disturbances have occurred in the capital and other provinces. The details are recorded as follows: After a labor strike occurred at the Royal Palace Hotel in the capital, 15 employees immediately occupied the premises. The owner then drove them out with friends, one of whom was a right-wing figure, former Paris City Councilor Sabatier, causing a conflict that injured four people. Afterwards, Sabatier hired a car on a business trip to return to his residence. On the way, he was suddenly stopped by members of the Popular Front, and several gunshots were heard. When the police arrived, they neither found the person who fired the gun nor anyone injured. Even the bullets could not be found. This happened yesterday morning. By the afternoon, 300 men and women had gathered at the Star Square, shouting "Long live Colonel de la Rocque, long live the Croix-de-Feu!" (Note: de la Rocque is the leader of the Croix-de-Feu.) The leader of the group, fearing an incident, advised them to disperse, but to no effect. The police arrested several people. The Croix-de-Feu headquarters in Saint-Étienne has been closed. The members then formed a team to go to the World War Memorial for a demonstration and sang the national anthem. On the way, they clashed with members of the Popular Front, injuring several people. Two Croix-de-Feu members were arrested for carrying wooden sticks. In Saint-Étienne, newsboys from the royalist Action Française and the communist Avant-Garde fought each other, injuring several people. The police restored order. In Amiens, members of the Patriotic Youth League marched out with the blue, white, and red flags (the French national flag) and armbands. Striking workers saw them and immediately stepped forward to seize them, resulting in disturbances. The police stopped them. (21st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Various paramilitary groups have been clearly ordered to be dissolved. Interior Minister Sarraut recently strictly ordered the authorities of various provinces to promptly implement this order. Places that were previously used as gathering places for these groups, or that may be used by these groups in the future, should also be closely monitored, so that the members of each group will not be allowed to hold gatherings or demonstrations.

<p>Brussels: According to an announcement by the Ministry of the Interior yesterday, the strike situation in Belgium has now taken a turn. There was only a small conflict in Ghent. The striking workers threatened to come here in teams. The authorities have sent troops to block the roads, but the workers do not seem likely to take this action. Labor and management in the mining industry reached a compromise yesterday on the following three points: The minimum daily wage is 32 francs; Recognition of the labor union; Vacation wages will be paid. Most other industries have accepted the recommendations of the arbitration committee. The employer's request for a 40-hour work week for workers is now awaiting government decision. The Cabinet meeting today will discuss this matter. A Socialist senator was conscripted by the gendarmerie in the mining area to repair the roads destroyed by the striking workers. The man has not yet obtained a parliamentary immunity certificate. Because the employer has allowed a daily wage increase of 12 francs, the dockworkers in Antwerp agreed yesterday to resume work on Sunday. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

It is said that miners in Borinage and Charleroi are planning to march in teams to the capital. The government has mobilized troops to guard the main roads between the capital and Charleroi to prevent this. Troops are also stationed on the roads in the southern province of Brabant that lead directly to the capital. Barbed wire has been set up near the city of Halle to guard it. Strikers in various places are flying red flags everywhere in the streets to persuade workers to join the strike movement. So far, although some industries have reached agreements between labor and management, only the dockworkers in the port of Antwerp have resumed work. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Policies to actively assist in the construction of Chinese railways and other economic cooperation with China, proposal to establish a new trade control agency, proposal to establish an independent health administration agency, plan to implement rural social policies, plan to reorganize central and local finances, plan to increase taxes, plan to establish additional monopoly systems, plan to expand troop strength in Manchuria, plan to increase inland divisions and other army national defense plans, navy's five-year national defense replenishment plan, proposal to establish a Ministry of Aviation or Bureau of Aviation, plan to implement an eight-year compulsory education system, plan to implement an agricultural insurance system, iron and steel national policy plan, plan to subsidize the coal liquefaction industry, electricity control plan, proposal to establish a minister without portfolio. When the Prime Minister decides on these important national policy items, he will not hesitate to adopt as many as possible that are truly national policies, important, and desired by all parties, as long as they are financially feasible. Therefore, which policies will be adopted as the current cabinet's policies is highly noteworthy. (Domei dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The desire to establish a Ministry of Aviation within the Army, which was proposed by the Army members of the Aviation Business Investigation Committee that met in September last year and entrusted to a special committee organized by the responsible officials of the relevant ministries, has continued to this day. The Army, in view of the pressing international situation, will focus on strengthening aviation in the new national defense replenishment plan for the future, and is determined to devote all its efforts to ensuring that Japanese aviation possesses unparalleled aviation power in the future and for the next ten years. This issue of strengthening aviation is not only an issue for the Army, but from the perspective of national defense policy, it is naturally necessary for the Cabinet to attach importance to this issue. Under this view, Minister of the Army Terauchi will strongly advocate the necessity of establishing a Ministry of Aviation at the Cabinet meeting where important national policies are decided.

<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Baba spoke to reporters at his villa in Atami yesterday about the financial reorganization issue, saying, "I plan to decide on my personal opinions on the financial reorganization plan before the cabinet meeting in early next month. When compiling the budget for the 12th year of Showa (1937), I will definitely clarify the entire picture. Although it is difficult to implement everything from the next fiscal year, if this reform is successful, it can carry out the major national policy of 'revitalizing national affairs' that the current cabinet calls for. However, I have no intention of establishing a large investigation committee specifically for reorganizing finances. Regarding the content of financial reorganization, while it is a correct view in theory to collect all financial resources in the central government and then appropriately distribute them to the regions, there are also those who argue that the regions should retain adequate financial resources. I plan to adopt a compromise plan, and the transfer of the house tax to the national tax is also a strong consideration." (Domei dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Dr. Montréal, the leader of the American observation team, telegraphed Moscow, saying, "The observation was successful. Congratulations to all Soviet astronomers and thank the Soviet government for its assistance. The results of the work will be published within at least six months."</p>
<p>The weather at Shala Station was good. Two Soviet teams, one Italian team, and one Czech team all successfully completed their planned projects. Akbulak reported that a special train came here from Orenburg to observe the solar eclipse. The scientists looked up at the clouds with great anxiety, and upon learning that the clouds would not hinder the observation, they also saw a large swarm of locusts flying across the sky, but they were dispersed by airplanes, and the observation was completely successful.</p>

<p>— Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>In recent years, food has consistently ranked first among China's imported goods. Taking 1935 as an example, the total value of imported rice, wheat, flour, and other grains amounted to 136 million yuan, roughly equivalent to two-fifths of the trade deficit (243.1 million yuan). In recent years, the average trade deficit in rice and wheat accounts for about 4% of the national average production (calculated with wheat and flour, where every 100 catties of wheat can be made into 70 catties of flour). It is generally common for industrial countries to be unable to be self-sufficient in food. However, China's industry is underdeveloped, the number of farmers is far greater in comparison, and even the people's food supply relies on foreign countries, with annual outflows exceeding 100 million yuan. If something happens in East Asia and overseas sources are cut off, a food panic is highly concerning. There are, of course, many ways to solve the food problem, such as reclaiming wasteland, improving farming methods, banning opium cultivation, preventing famines, improving marketing organizations, adjusting surpluses and deficits among provinces, restoring accumulated grain storage, maintaining balanced grain prices, and also appropriately determining import tariffs to protect domestic agricultural products, so that the phenomenon of foreign rice encroaching on the market and low grain prices hurting farmers can be eliminated in the future. It is a well-known fact that one of the reasons for Germany's defeat in the European War was the shortage of food. Guaranteeing the food supply for the people and the army is the most crucial task.</p>
<p>China's annual cotton production is 13 million dan (average from 1933 to 1935), with the Yangtze and Yellow River basins each accounting for half. China's cotton production often falls short of meeting domestic consumption needs. In 1934, when there was a good domestic cotton harvest, the total value of imports was 40 million yuan, while in 1934 it was 90 million yuan. Most imported cotton comes from India and the United States. Indian cotton wins in quantity, while American cotton wins in quality. The ordinary quality of Chinese cotton is not good, with very short fibers, so ways to improve it must be found. Silk, tea, and soybeans have always been China's major exports. Soybean exports from the eastern provinces have historically been relied upon to offset the majority of the food trade deficit, but this is no longer the case. Raw silk is a sideline for farm families in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces and is highly valued. In 1935, the total silkworm cocoon production was 1.4 million dan, and the total raw silk production was 95,000 dan, of which Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces accounted for slightly less than two-thirds, and Guangdong accounted for slightly less than one-quarter. Raw silk exports and domestic consumption each account for about half. China's tea production is over 5 million dan, with annual exports of around 1 million dan, worth about 20 million yuan. In addition, there is a shortage of economic crops such as sugar cane and tobacco raw materials. Over the years, foreign sugar and tobacco have been important import items. Timber is also a major import, with recent import amounts exceeding 30 million yuan, mostly for construction purposes, and a significant number of railroad ties. Moreover, it increases annually. Timber is a commodity with very low transport capacity, due to its bulk and weight, its price is extremely low, so to develop mountains and forests, one must start by improving transportation and saving on labor costs. Among forestry by-products, tung oil and tussah silk are the most valuable. In 1936, tung oil exports reached a staggering 40 million yuan, ranking second among export goods, which was unprecedented. Tussah silk is used not only for weaving silk but also as a material for aircraft wings, while tung oil is used for aircraft coatings, so demand has increased greatly in recent years. China produces about 20,000 dan of tussah silk, centered in Liaoning, with recent exports reaching 20 million yuan. Rubber is a tropical product and has a wide range of uses in modern industry. Hainan Island is the only place in China where rubber can be grown. China's animal husbandry can be divided into two major regions: the central region and the three northeastern provinces are agricultural regions, while the northwest border region is a nomadic region, with the Greater Khingan Range and the Yin Mountains as their natural boundaries. In the former, animal husbandry is a sideline for farmers, while in the latter, animal husbandry is the only means of livelihood. The northwest provinces produce 600,000 dan of wool and 100,000 dan of camel hair annually, mostly exported from Tianjin. According to 1935 statistics, the export value of wool, camel hair, hides, and carpets totaled 40 million yuan. Hides are mostly obtained through hunting, while carpets are mostly hand-woven products. There is still a lack of accurate statistics on the total number of horses in China. Recently, equine administration has been neglected, and it is feared that strong warhorses are no longer readily available. Improving horses is crucial for military purposes. Meat is scarce in rural areas, so fish are heavily relied upon to supplement the deficiency. The state of China's fishing industry has not been thoroughly investigated. In 1935, imports of fish and seafood were nearly 20 million yuan, which shows the decline of the fishing industry. The development of the fishing industry is linked to shipping and the navy. Salt tax is a major source of revenue for China. The total salt production in the country is over 55 million dan, of which sea salt accounts for 20%. China's salt production is more than self-sufficient, with annual exports of 6 million dan to Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>Among China's minerals, coal is the most important. According to estimates by the Geological Survey, the nation's coal reserves are 246 billion tons, ranking third in the world, behind the United States and Canada. However, calculated per capita, each person only gets 500 tons, which is less than the United States' 10,000 tons per person, Britain's 4,000 tons, and Germany's 1,500 tons, only exceeding Japan's 100 tons per person. The coal reserves in each province are very unevenly distributed, with Shanxi Province accounting for 52% of the national total, and Shaanxi Province accounting for 29%. The two together account for 81%, which is more than four-fifths. It is said that if Shanxi's coal mines can be developed, it would be like Britain in Western Europe and Pennsylvania in the United States. China's important coalfields are all in North China, and it is very concerning that the coal industry would be devastated in the event of war. In 1933, China's total coal production was over 28 million tons, ranking eighth in the world, even ahead of Japan. In that year, the four northeastern provinces produced over 9 million tons of coal, accounting for one-third. China's iron ore is quite scarce, with national reserves of 1.02 billion tons, averaging only 2.5 tons per person. Liaoning Province alone accounts for 77% of the national iron ore reserves, and Chahar accounts for 9%. Liaoning is to iron as Shanxi and Shaanxi are to coal; the Bohai Sea and the Yellow River are the lifeline of China's mineral resources. Liaoning's iron ore is second only to India in East Asia and has now become an overseas base for Japan's steel industry. Japan's iron production capacity is 1.5 million tons per year, and steel production has reached 2.1 million tons, so Japan not only needs ore from abroad but also needs to absorb raw iron from India and Liaoning as raw materials. According to 1933 statistics, the iron ore production in Anshan, Benxi, and other iron mines in Liaoning was 500,000 tons, but in reality, we no longer own it. The iron industry in the interior is extremely depressed, producing only tens of thousands of tons per year. The iron ore in Hubei and Anhui provinces in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is all exported to Japan, which is no different from working for others. The annual iron production using indigenous methods throughout the country is also only 100,000 tons, mostly consumed in local iron foundries. In terms of the current national demand for steel, it reaches 600,000 tons per year, mostly relying on imports from Britain and Japan. In 1934 and 1935, the average import of steel was 80 million yuan, accounting for 8% of the total national imports. China's oil reserves are estimated to be 3.6 billion barrels (40 gallons per barrel), of which oil shale in Fushun contains 1.9 billion barrels, accounting for 53% of the total national reserves. Fushun's oil shale is the richest in East Asia, almost one-third of the United States or Russia, and one-twentieth of the world's total, so its importance is evident. China's oil production is extremely scarce, but Fushun stands out exceptionally, with a production of 80,000 tons in 1933, and it is estimated that it can produce 300,000 tons per year. Among China's inland oilfields, Shaanxi is the most promising, with both natural oil and oil shale, and oil wells have been explored, with good results, but the output is still negligible, so China must rely on foreign oil, at least for the time being. In 1933, the import of oil, including kerosene, diesel, and gasoline, totaled 75 million yuan, of which kerosene accounted for half, and diesel and gasoline each accounted for a quarter. China's gold and silver production is very small, around 100,000 taels each. There is a surplus of tin ore but a shortage of copper ore. The national tin production is 9,000 tons per year, with 90% coming from Yunnan, a single old tin mine. The annual consumption of copper is 6,000 tons, but the production is only about one-tenth. Copper is an electrical material and is indirectly related to military affairs. China's antimony and tungsten mines are particularly abundant. Hunan's antimony and Jiangxi's tungsten can both be the best in the world. Both are related to the manufacture of munitions, so they have attracted worldwide attention. The world's antimony production is 16,000 tons, and China produces two-fourths. The world's tungsten production is 14,000 tons, and China produces a strong two-fifths. These two minerals have no market in China and are almost entirely exported, subject to foreign merchants manipulating prices. If we could set up our own refineries and study their uses, wouldn't these rare metals be rare commodities to hold? The use of aluminum is growing daily, and the raw materials for airplanes require a lot. Aluminum can be extracted from alunite, and Pingyang, Zhejiang, has as much as 2 billion tons of alunite. If the extraction test is successful, it is hoped that it will become one of the countries with the most aluminum production in the world.</p>
<p>China's modern industry is represented by the cotton textile industry. According to 1934 statistics, there were a total of 133 yarn factories in the country, with a total of 5.2 million spindles, of which Chinese merchants owned 56%, Japanese merchants owned 40%, and British merchants owned 4%. Among the factories, there are 43,000 power looms, of which Chinese merchants own 48%, Japanese merchants own 45%, and British merchants own 7%. The number of spindles per thousand people in China is still the lowest among the major cotton textile countries in the world. Britain is the hegemon of this industry, with 1,200 spindles per thousand people. Japan also has 100 spindles per thousand people, while China only has 12 spindles per thousand people. If only Chinese yarn factories are counted, there are still less than 7 spindles per thousand people. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan was able to meet domestic needs and developed overseas markets. Japan's exports of cotton textiles to China accounted for half. China's cotton textile industry is constantly threatened, namely, the competition from foreign yarn factories inside and outside China and the dumping of foreign imported cotton goods. As a result, some Chinese spinning factories that are operating at a loss are gradually being acquired by Japanese companies. In 1935, the import of cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth reached 65 million yuan (of which cotton yarn and cotton cloth accounted for 23 million yuan), accounting for one-ninth of the trade deficit in the same year. In terms of the geographical distribution of China's cotton textile industry, Shanghai accounts for more than half. Combined with Wuxi and Nantong, Jiangsu Province accounts for two-thirds of the country, its important status like Lancashire in Britain and Osaka in Japan. Raw silk is the largest export for both China and Japan, and the United States is the largest market for both. After the war, Japanese cotton cloth sales spread to India and Southeast Asia, and in recent years, they have expanded to Africa and the Near East, replacing raw silk as the top export. The market price of raw silk is unlikely to rise due to the pressure from rayon. China's silk industry has been very depressed in recent years, and its first export position has long been replaced by soybeans. Last year, it was below tung oil and ranked second. In 1930, there were more than 180 silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with more than 55,000 machines. Due to the low price of silk in Europe and the United States, three-fifths of them were suspended or closed down. One reason for the failure of the silk industry is the dumping of cheap Japanese silk, and the other is the rise of rayon. In 1935, China's raw silk exports were 35 million yuan, accounting for 2% of the total exports. In the same year, rayon imports were 7 million yuan, and much of it was used to interweave with natural silk and cotton yarn. China's wool textile industry is very underdeveloped. The output of domestic woolen mills is only 1 million yuan. In 1935, the import of woolen fabrics and wool yarn totaled 13 million yuan. At present, the demand for woolen products is increasing, and it is necessary to improve wool and increase textile production. Although the price of raw silk is higher than that of wool, because it is a domestic product, there is room for research in the uniforms of the military and political circles. The total value of China's machine paper-making industry is nearly 10 million yuan. During its heyday, the annual value of handmade paper was 50 million yuan, but recently it has been less than 20 million yuan. In total, domestic paper production is less than 30 million yuan, but China's annual consumption of paper is about 70 million yuan, with an annual deficit of 40 million yuan, relying on imports. European paper imports account for two-fifths, and Japanese imports account for one-third. The nature of newspapers is different from other enterprises. The importance of the news industry is even greater during wartime than in peacetime. The establishment of newspaper mills should not be regarded as a slow plan. China's cement consumption is 6 million barrels per year, and the production of domestic cement plants is 4 million barrels. The deficit is imported from abroad, and the value of imported cement is 2 million yuan per year. Porcelain is a traditional industry in China, with a total national output of 20 million yuan. Japan's total output of ceramics is 80 million yen, and China is far behind. In recent years, the import and export value of Chinese ceramics has often been a deficit.</p>
<p>China's industrial base has not yet been established. Ordinary industries such as cotton weaving and cement industries are not yet developed, and basic industries have very few achievements. The so-called basic industries are those whose products cannot be directly supplied to consumers but are used as tools for general industries, such as the machinery industry. Machinery is mostly related to the steel industry, so it is called heavy industry. The importance of basic industries is often far greater than their own monetary value, such as the products of the chemical industry. These industries are mostly large-scale and cannot be undertaken by private enterprises. Moreover, because they are closely related to national interests and people's welfare, they should be operated by the state. The current situation of the decline of China's steel industry has been mentioned above. As for machinery factories, most of them lack capital and are small in scale. In 1935, the import value of machinery (including textile machinery, electrical machinery, and other tools) was 15.5 million yuan, which indicates that China's modern industry is gradually developing, but it is also a great deficit in the national economy. The Ministry of Industry is planning to establish a China Machinery Manufacturing Factory, which is a major task at present. According to the Statistics of the Construction Committee in 1934, there were more than 460 power plants in the country, with a power generation capacity of 480,000 kilowatts (that is, 640,000 horsepower, excluding the three northeastern provinces). Although only 11 of them are operated by foreigners, their power generation capacity accounts for half, such as the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which accounts for 200,000 horsepower, and most of the power for Shanghai factories is supplied by this. China's power plants all use coal as fuel and are called thermal power plants. The hydropower business is still under exploration. According to the plan of the Construction Committee, the first hydropower plant will be set up at the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River in Yichang, with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts (that is, 400,000 horsepower), and the construction cost is estimated to be 400 million yuan. Hydropower plants are closely related to the chemical industry, and there are very few chemical industries in China, far from enough. In recent years, the products of the chemical industry such as rayon, artificial fertilizers, and dyes have been imported in large quantities, and the manufacture of explosives and toxic gases is also related to the chemical industry. They make a great contribution to national defense. Shipbuilding is also one of the basic industries. It is said that ships are the lifeline of Britain's national wealth, and Japan's various mechanical industries are also related to shipbuilding. Because shipbuilding is developed, the shipping industry is prosperous, and because maritime transportation is developed, the navy is also strong. China's warships total 27,500 tons, with 2/5 self-made, 1/4 made by Germany and Japan and 1/7 from Britain. The Jiangnan Shipyard made 3/5 of the self-made warships, and the Mawei Shipyard made just over 1/4. Japanese shipyards can also manufacture airplanes, so the Japanese Air Force has a strong potential force. As for the automobiles and processed tank vehicles used by the army, the technology of Japanese factories is also improving with each passing year. According to the 1934 statistics, there were 50,000 cars in China. According to Mr. Yao Xiguang's statistics (see the English China Yearbook in 1935), there were 433 military aircraft and 24 naval aircraft. Almost all cars and airplanes are foreign products, which is a pity from the perspective of national defense. All far-sighted governments spare no effort to encourage basic industries, without saying anything superfluous.</p>
<p>Modern transportation is what China lacks most at present. According to 1933 statistics, the total length of railways in the country was only 18,000 kilometers, of which the length of state-owned railways was more than 12,000 kilometers, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total railway length in the country, the length of private railways was 2,400 kilometers, and the length of railways contracted by foreigners was more than 3,300 kilometers, accounting for 30% of the total railway length in the country. In 1935, the total length of newly built railway lines such as Yuehan, Longhai, Zhegan, and Tongpu was 1,700 kilometers, which is less than 20,000 kilometers in total, which is far from the 400,000 kilometers of railways in the United States. In 1934, the Japanese state-owned railway was 16,000 kilometers, plus the private railway was about 8,000 kilometers, a total of more than 24,000 kilometers, with an average of one kilometer of railway per 4,000 people, while in China, there is only one kilometer of railway per 20,000 people. Most of the major railway lines in China are north of the Yangtze River, and the three northeastern provinces account for the most, accounting for 2/5 of the total railway investment in the country, which we no longer own. The total tonnage of China's merchant ships is only 400,000 tons, which is only one-tenth of Japan's. Japan's merchant ships total more than 4.3 million tons (1934 statistics), making it the world's third largest shipping country, with annual freight of 200 million yuan (Japanese currency) contributed to the motherland from overseas goods. In China, there is a current lack of giant seagoing ships, and foreign trade relies entirely on other people's ships. Even in coastal trade, most of it relies on foreign merchant ships.

<p>The Railway Anti-Smuggling Department Has No Way to Stop It</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent days, the smuggling of goods from Tianjin to Jinan has been increasing. Previously, they were transported by train No. 309 of the Pingpu Line, which arrived in Jinan at about 9:00 am. Now, train No. 21 of the Jinpu Line, which arrives in Jinan at about 8:00 pm, also carries a large number of smuggled goods, which are surging more and more. There is still no way to stop it. This morning (the 19th), train No. 305 was loaded with smuggled goods, and the number was even greater, with 787 pieces of rayon, 70 pieces of sugar, 12 pieces of cloth ends, 7 pieces of cigarette paper, and 12 pieces of materials, totaling 888 pieces. There were also sixteen or seventeen packages wrapped in paper, shaped like biscuit boxes, which were very heavy, but it is not known what they were. Except for the first and second-class sleeping cars and the dining car, there were no smuggled goods. The four third-class cars and one second-class scattered-seat car were all fully loaded with bags and mat bags. Except for a few smugglers, there was not a single passenger on the train. The smuggled goods were unloaded on the platform, forming a small mountain. It took an hour to move them. The bicycle left. To prevent it, Li Tonghua, deputy director of the Railway Anti-Smuggling Department, is scheduled to take train No. 202 of the Pinghu Line to Tianjin at 8:00 pm tonight to report to An Sier, director of the General Department, and then go to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Finance on the recent situation of smuggling in North China and ask for fundamental prevention measures. The smugglers, because the smuggled goods could not be transported to the south, went to the station to contact Wang Yongzeng, the station master, offering a bribe of 2 yuan per package to allow them to be transported to the south. Wang sternly refused and reported the situation of temptation to his superiors. The smugglers had no choice but to become dissatisfied with Wang.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Shandong Province Unifies Tax Collection <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Tax Collection Offices Established in Various Counties, Various Tax Bureaus Abolished</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Department of Finance, in order to unify the tax collection in various counties, according to the resolution of the previous National Financial Conference, has uniformly established tax collection offices in various counties throughout the province. The county government no longer concurrently handles this work. After the establishment of the tax collection offices, the various tax bureaus that have been established in various counties are abolished. Various county treasuries are also established uniformly in various counties as collection and remittance agencies. This measure is an unprecedented major reform in the province's finances. The principles have been submitted to the provincial government's political affairs meeting and approved. In order to facilitate the implementation, the Department of Finance recently convened administrative commissioners from various districts to Jinan to study and has made a complete decision. Therefore, the Department is drafting the temporary regulations and budgets for the tax collection offices and county treasuries in various counties, which will be submitted to the provincial government's political affairs meeting today (the 19th) for discussion and resolution, and will be promulgated for implementation immediately. It is stipulated that the counties within the commissioner districts must establish tax collection offices and county treasuries by the 25th year of the Republic (according to the regulations, various counties merge the first and third sections to establish county treasuries. Various counties within the commissioner districts have already merged the second and third sections). The remaining counties are also required to establish tax collection offices uniformly from the 25th year of the Republic and report their establishment in July of this year, merge the second and third sections, and establish county treasuries, which must also be realized by September of this year. Detailed measures for the tax collection offices: Except for Zouping and Heze counties, the 103 counties in the province are divided into 11 districts, including Jinan, Jining, Zhoucun, Weixian, Qingdao, Linqing, Yantai, Linyi, Bochuan, Tengxian, Zaozhuang, etc. The gold and silver collected by the tax collection offices in various counties are kept in the treasuries and remitted to the provincial treasury through nearby Minsheng Bank, Ping City Official Money Bureau, China Transportation Bank, etc. The scope of collection by the tax collection offices has also been stipulated, including land tax, surtax, livestock, slaughter, oil, tooth, and various business taxes, the ordinary business tax handled on behalf of the government, tobacco and alcohol license tax, and all local donations and taxes in various counties, etc., are the responsibility of the tax collection offices, which must have a guarantee of 10,000 yuan. The county treasuries must also have a guarantee of 10,000 yuan. According to statistics, the annual expenses of the tax collection offices in 103 counties total 574,117 yuan.</p>

<p>The Boundary Between Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces Is Clearly Demarcated</p>
<p>Jiaohu Correspondence: The main and branch lines of the provincial roads in Anhui Province have been completed by 80-90%. The county roads in various counties are also actively being expedited separately in order to seek connections. Now, the Anhui Construction Department takes the Wujiang Town, which connects the four seasons and eight festivals of Jiangsu and Anhui from Pukou, as the starting point. From Wujiang, it passes through Hexian County Town, Xibu, Qimen, and arrives at Hanshan, and then from Han to Qingxi and Jieshipu. The section of the highway passing through Bantang and directly to Chaoxian County is 76 kilometers long. Because it is related to the connection of the two major national highways, the Jingchuan and Shaanxi Highways, it is of great significance. It is specially stipulated that the measurement should start from June 6 and be completed and opened to traffic by the end of last month. Therefore, the county governments of Hexian, Hanshan, and Chaoxian County have divided the work and repaired the roads day and night to ensure that the project is completed as scheduled. At the same time, the Hequan Highway, which is connected to this road, starts from Xibu and reaches Guanduhe in Quanjiao, with a length of 15 kilometers. It is also ordered to be built within January and February. The public works projects in Hequan have been urged. The boundary between Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, which is located in the Danyong Town area bordering Jiangning County in Jiangsu and Dangtu County in Anhui, has never been clearly demarcated, which has led to endless disputes among farmers in the two provinces over water conservancy over the years. The authorities of the two provinces also have difficulty dealing with it. Now, Chen Guofu, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, and Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of Anhui Province, in order to thoroughly resolve the issue, have ordered their respective supervising commissioner's offices to be responsible for surveying and demarcating the boundary. Gao Wenbo, the Commissioner of Anhui Engineering District and the County Chief of Wu County, has once consulted with Mei Siping, the Commissioner of Jiangsu and the County Chief of Jiangning County, on the steps of surveying and demarcation and decided to hold a joint survey on June 20. Yesterday, Hou Hongkai, the construction commissioner of Wu County, the representative of Gao, and Liu Yigong, the county chief of Dangtu, directly surveyed the boundary. Specialists from the Ministry of Interior also participated. From now on, it will be able to be clearly demarcated and eliminate disputes forever. (June 10)</p>

<p>Total Confiscation Exceeds Tens of Thousands of Smokers</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Hubei Province has long been an area rife with opium and drugs. Western and Northern Hubei were also opium poppy production areas. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued strict orders to prohibit them, opium poppies have disappeared, and the smuggling, sale, and consumption of opium have also decreased significantly. Now that the general inspection has been completed, the achievements are quite impressive. According to statistics from the main operating agency, in 70 counties across the province:</p>
<p>*   6,678 opium dens were sealed up.</p>
<p>*   692 opium-related criminal cases were cracked, including 24 smuggling cases and 668 cases of illegal sale and consumption.</p>
<p>*   221 drug-related criminal cases were cracked, with 4 serious offenders executed by firing squad, 2 sentenced to life imprisonment, 120 sentenced to imprisonment for up to six years, and 13 sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years.</p>
<p>*   124 drug rehabilitation hospitals and centers were established, including 105 opium rehabilitation hospitals and 19 drug rehabilitation centers.</p>
<p>*   20,062 opium smokers were forcibly rehabilitated, and 41,919 people quit opium voluntarily.</p>
<p>*   A total of 240,118 opium smokers were registered. Among them, over 160,000 were registered by the end of the month, and over 170,000 were registered during the supplementary registration period ending June 15th.</p>
<p>*   A total of 115,057 "gong suo" (a unit of weight) of drugs and opium materials were burned, including six categories: morphine, heroin, red pills, opium dross, compound substances, and poppy seeds. (20th)</p>

<p>Establishing a Superior Sugarcane Breeding Farm and Hiring Entomologists to Study Pest Control</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Feng Rui, the manager of the Guangdong Sugar Manufacturing Factory, is actively focusing on improving sugarcane production in order to ensure the early success of the sugar industry's revival. He is making every effort to improve two important areas: sugarcane breeding and pest control. Regarding the cultivation of superior sugarcane varieties, a complete superior sugarcane breeding farm has been established in Tanpu, with the aim of providing superior sugarcane varieties to the entire province. Therefore, Professor Lin Jiaqi of Zhongda University has been specially hired to oversee all the work at the farm. Regarding pest control, Zhang Jubo, the former director of the Zhejiang Entomology Bureau, has also been hired to work with all the technicians of the Entomology Department of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Construction Department to research and promote methods for preventing and controlling sugarcane pests. A central sugarcane pest research laboratory has been established, and branch offices have been set up in Panyu, Nanhai, Shunde, and Zhongchuan counties. Each breeding farm of the manufacturing factory also has a pest control watch. At the same time, personnel are being dispatched to various locations to guide farmers in preventing and controlling sugarcane pests from the root. It has been found that there are currently twenty technicians engaged in this work, actively proceeding in various locations.</p>

<p>Wuxian County Method, In order to implement the notarization system, a report was submitted to the legal administration and approved. It was decided to start operating from July 1st and establish a notary office in the court. From then on, the people's legal actions or other facts regarding private rights may request the judge of the notary office to issue a notarized document, or to certify a private document, and the power of official notarization can be obtained. There are four benefits to the notarization system: Notarized documents or certified private documents are used by the court as the basis for judgment, far beyond the effectiveness of private documents and statement filings. Notarized documents can be used as the basis for compulsory enforcement, saving the loss of seeking litigation. The original notarized document and the copy of the certified private document are permanently preserved by the court, without fear of loss or destruction. The certificate can protect the legal privacy of the parties. This notarization system is still a pioneering effort in Jiangsu Province. After this implementation, many disputes can be avoided.</p>

<p>The spring silkworm season in this county has ended early. Silkworm rearing has ended early in the whole county. The whole county raised 100,000 sheets of silkworm eggs. The average yield of cocoons per sheet is 40 catties, and about 14 catties of dried cocoons are baked. The total output of dried cocoons in the whole county is 42,000 dan (the price of dried cocoons is 120 yuan per dan). Compared with last spring, the output is about one-third higher. The silkworm tax that can be collected is more than 180,000 yuan. Currently, in the model area, 170,000 yuan have been collected, and it will come to an end in about a week. All autumn silkworm affairs will also begin in a blink of an eye. According to the investigation, the county needs 220,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs. Therefore, 132,000 sheets of excellent autumn silkworm eggs have been purchased from major silkworm breeding farms in Jiangsu and Shanghai for farmers to order. The price of silkworm eggs is set at 4 jiao and 5 fen per sheet.</p>

<p>After the Public Security Bureau seized and inspected the stolen coal case in the Liujiang River, it seized three ships of stolen coal, intending to unload them at the Heqing Company organized by Ma Chuchu, etc. However, because the porters refused to unload the coal, the stolen coal remained on the ships. The unscrupulous merchant Zhu Changshou went to Shanghai to report to the Mitsui Company. The company then sent Japanese staff member Konoe Shinsuke and Chinese staff members Zhu Songtao and Wang Junshi to Wuxi again, lodging in rooms 78 and 92 of the New World Hotel. They went directly to the Special Commissioner's Office to meet with Special Commissioner Zang. The section chief received them, and after a long discussion, they dispersed without any results. More than a dozen ship owners transporting the stolen coal suffered heavy losses because they had not unloaded the goods for a long time. Therefore, they went to the New World to negotiate with Zhu Songtao and others, but there were no results. Yesterday (the 21st) at 9 a.m., the ship owners went to the New World again to make a scene. The Japanese and others had no choice but to return to Shanghai that night to report to the Mitsui Yoko and find other ways to unload the goods.</p>

<p>Magistrate Ma of Jiangdu County, due to the opening of the cocoon industry, while cocoon merchants in Jingjiang and other counties were still following old customs, drawing two-cent commissions and deducting 9.7 percent of the cocoon price, the Construction Department believed that cocoon merchants were different from other brokers, already having benefits, and the Japanese provincial control regulations did not have this British provision. A special order was given to investigate and prohibit it. Yesterday (the 19th), in the name of the director of the Improvement Zone, an instruction was issued to the old-age central guidance center, ordering it to investigate whether the cocoon merchants under its jurisdiction had the above-mentioned circumstances and to strictly ban them.</p>

They broke into the house and shouted for silence. They first tied up and tortured Wang Zhiben, his mother, and his wife, demanding money. Wang endured the pain and refused to give in. The bandits overturned boxes and cabinets, searched for clothes and silver jewelry, and kidnapped Wang Zhiben before escaping by boat. When they reached the vicinity of Maling in the western township, the bandits were tired and fell asleep. Zhiben seized the opportunity to escape and went to the city to seek medical treatment. The county government was notified and immediately dispatched security forces and the Public Security Bureau's squad to the countryside to pursue and arrest the criminals, with the aim of apprehending the perpetrators and punishing them.</p>

Although the Party and government officials convened mediation, no results were achieved due to the large differences in wages. Mediation was held again on the afternoon of the 20th. Representatives from both labor and management met at the County Party Department. As a result of the mediation, the wage for three-leaf velvet was set at 2 jiao and 6 fen per "pi", and the wage for four-leaf velvet was set at 2 jiao and 8 fen per "pi". However, the management representative's highest standard was only 3 jiao, so although they reluctantly signed, there may still be changes in the future. The mediation has limited the workers to resume work before the 25th.</p>

<p>Zhang Qingxiang, a local bully in Liangzhu Town, Hangzhou County, inherited a large amount of property after his brother died early. However, in order to embezzle his brother's property, Zhang claimed that his nephew Mao Song (it is said that his biological son was adopted as his brother's heir) suffered from a mental illness and imprisoned him in a dark room for eight years. Since this case was reported, it has caused quite a stir in society. Wang Wenjun, a magistrate specially appointed by the Hangzhou District Court and the Army, led clerks, judicial police, etc., to personally conduct an on-site inspection. As a result, Zhang Qingxiang was arrested and sent to prison. After questioning Zhang's sister-in-law, Wang, and his daughter-in-law, Lu, they confessed that after Zhang Qingxiang imprisoned Mao Song, he took advantage of his power to rape his widowed sister-in-law and daughter-in-law. Although the neighbors had heard something, they kept silent due to Zhang's power. The court believes that this case is a great violation of human ethics. In addition to the portion of imprisoning Mao Song and obstructing his freedom, which has been prosecuted, the prosecutor's office decided to file a public prosecution against the part of raping the widowed sister-in-law and daughter-in-law to severely punish him.</p>

<p>— Zhu Ping</p>
<p>4. Principles of National Economic Construction</p>
<p>(1) The factors of production are "human power," "land power," and "capital power." The development of production activities must adopt a "human power" and "land power" combination and give it the power to make reasonable placements and applications so that it becomes a systematic and consciously planned activity. Therefore, the allocation of production factors is not something that can be accomplished overnight. National economic development is not something that can be done in a short period. Therefore, the only way to proceed is to make practical adjustments and combinations to the existing economic and production units, so that they become an organized body, and then they can be purposefully and systematically unified.</p>
<p>(2) The construction of national economy should take the entire nation as the goal. Under the current national situation, it is especially important to carefully examine the geographical situation of transportation in various places. All the establishment of basic industries and the construction of major projects must be selected in safe zones with emphasis on defense.</p>
<p>(3) The county should be regarded as the basic regional unit of the national economic organization. All production, exchange, consumption, and transportation within the county should be the economic scope. Efforts should be made to make the organizational structure and commercial activities of the county vigorous and beneficial to the economic movement of the county, while also being suitable for individual survival.</p>
<p>(4) Local defense organizations and educational undertakings should be integrated with economic construction, so that they can mutually assist and promote each other under the overall goal.</p>
<p>(5) "Human power" is the most important element of production. To build a national economy, all social "human power" should be assigned in a planned manner. All adult men and women (assumed to be 18 to 45 years old) have the obligation to serve and work, and the period of service should be stipulated according to the actual needs of various places.</p>
<p>(6) The number of adult men and women in each county and the nature of their abilities—such as being suitable for working, farming, serving in the military, or serving as doctors, nurses, or teachers—should be thoroughly investigated and registered separately for mobilization at any time.</p>
<p>(7) In order to facilitate the mobilization and control of "human power," the registered "human power" should be given strict organization and appropriate training. In addition to cultivating their production skills and the spirit of group work, the training of "human power" must also teach them self-defense capabilities, so that they can protect the safety of their economic construction within the possible range with self-defense forces.</p>
<p>(8) Land is a necessary tool for production. Each county should measure and estimate the area of various types of land within its territory, and control its utilization and adjust its ownership relationships.</p>
<p>(9) Actively carry out irrigation, dredging, filling, and other water conservancy projects to increase arable land area.</p>
<p>(10) Landless farmers should be provided with land as much as possible, so as to make full use of "human power" and increase "land power."</p>
<p>(11) Establish model farms in various places as appropriate, apply appropriate scientific methods and machinery to improve productivity and increase production.</p>
<p>(12) Improve the production capacity of model farms and encourage farmers to automatically adopt new farming techniques or organize cooperatives to improve agricultural management and increase agricultural production. The government must give special treatment to cooperatives (such as the use of public machinery, technical guidance, transportation convenience, economic assistance, and the establishment of cultural defense facilities) to promote farmers' engagement in collective production.</p>
<p>(13) Sidelines are the tail end for farmers to absorb surplus labor, and their impact on farmers' income is very large. The government must provide practical guidance according to the distribution of sidelines in various places, improve their products, and increase their production.</p>
<p>(14) Establish a sound rural credit organization, adjust rural finance, and support the development of emerging cooperative fields and general agriculture.</p>
<p>(15) All large-scale and basic industries should be operated or supervised by the government, and investment by domestic and foreign capital should be encouraged with appropriate conditions or lease operation methods.</p>
<p>(16) The government should encourage and improve various handicrafts with special effectiveness according to the operating conditions of each handicraft, in order to make up for the current shortage of mechanical production.</p>
<p>(17) According to the government's financial resources and needs, gradually distribute the power grid to various places to supply light, heat, electricity, and other power required for residence, manufacturing, and transportation.</p>
<p>(18) The construction of light industrial plants must meet the following principles:</p>
<p>In areas near the place where raw materials are produced, manufacturing of various related industrial products should be concentrated as much as possible, so that production costs can be reduced and product standards can be unified.</p>
<p>Small-scale factories should be widely established in rural central areas within the possible scope to facilitate farmers' participation in manufacturing work, so that the countryside will not be deserted due to population reduction, and cities will not be crowded due to too many factories, creating a poor social environment. The distribution of households can also be balanced, and resources in various places can be universally developed, so that even in the event of violent destruction, only a part will be affected.</p>
<p>(19) Under the principle of guaranteeing facility safety and safeguarding labor welfare, efforts should be made to adjust labor-management relations and work together to seek the development of the entire national economy.</p>
<p>(20) The exchange of commodities should be given appropriate control, so as to shorten the distance between producers and consumers, and between raw material suppliers and manufacturers.</p>
<p>(21) The import and export of commodities in each locality must be organized by the local commercial associations to jointly organize import and export trade hubs. All import and export of commodities must be handled through the general hub. Any individual actions will be sanctioned by the same industry.</p>
<p>(22) The types, quantities, and sources of consumer goods in various places, as well as the types, quantities, and marketing areas of local products, should be thoroughly investigated and statistically analyzed to gradually rationalize the exchange of commodities. Non-essential consumer goods that are not manufactured in this country should be restricted as much as possible.</p>
<p>(23) Commodity prices should be rationally controlled to protect the appropriate level of profit for producers and balance the profits of sellers.</p>
<p>(24) Financial institutions in various places should be concentrated under the entire economic construction plan to fully utilize their functions.</p>
<p>(25) The construction of transportation should be made suitable for the needs of economic construction and national defense, and the central government and provincial and county governments should design and implement it within their professional scope.</p>
<p>(26) The implementation of economic construction must rely on a large number of specialized talents or personnel with appropriate education to participate. At the beginning, existing personnel serving in central and local party and government agencies can be transferred to various places according to their abilities and assigned to various appropriate jobs.</p>
<p>(27) The policies concerning education at all levels of schools must be as closely aligned as possible with the needs of economic construction. At the same time, the activities of various cultural organizations should concentrate their efforts on conducting widespread publicity and mobilization for economic construction.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Sun Ke Speaks: Central Government Advocates Peace <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>No Word of Sending High-Ranking Officials South, Everything to Be Decided at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, met with reporters at his private residence on Columbia Road at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and stated that the Central Government has not yet received detailed reports recently. The Central Government's attitude has always been to advocate peace, hoping that the matter will be resolved peacefully as soon as possible to avoid fratricide and causing suffering to the people. According to his observation, the incidents in Guangdong and Guangxi can be turned into nothing. The tense situation can be resolved peacefully immediately. There are rumors that the Central Government will send high-ranking officials to the South to mediate the situation, but he is not aware of the details and has not heard of any such decision. If there is such a move, it will only be to convey the opinions of both parties. Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Forestry Bureau, and Sun Jiazhe, Director of the Unified Tax Bureau of the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi, came to Beijing this time. Feng is visiting Minister of Finance Kong to discuss financial issues in Guangdong Province. Sun is reporting everything to the Central Government and has already completed his official duties. Except for Sun, who has already returned to Guangdong, Feng will also return to the South to report on his mission. In short, domestic and foreign issues must be decided at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, which will be held in Beijing on July 10. Central Committee members from various places will arrive in Beijing to participate in advance. At present, Central Committee members from Guangdong and Guangxi, except for those who have important duties and cannot leave, can come to Beijing to attend. Sun also talked about the income tax regulations, which have not yet been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for discussion. Therefore, the collection date is unlikely to be implemented within the year.</p>

<p>Met with Guangdong Representative Feng Rui to Discuss, Sun Ke Hosted a Dinner at His Residence Yesterday Afternoon for a Long Talk</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Executive Committee, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday.

<h3 id="e101">Fundraising to Cover Seasonal Expenses: Cheng Yuanfan Comes to Shanghai Again <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Jin Runquan, Manager of the China Bank's Hangzhou Branch, Accompanies Him; Plans to Initially Borrow a Small Amount as Advance</p>
<p>Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Finance Department of Zhejiang Province, considering the approaching Summer Festival (i.e., the old lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival), the urgent need for funds in all sectors, and the pressing demand for various government expenditures, is negotiating with banks in Shanghai to mortgage the remaining funds from the public bond consolidation for a large loan of 5 million yuan. While initial progress has been made, the formalities are not yet complete, and it's too slow to meet immediate needs. Therefore, he invited Jin Runquan, Manager of the Hangzhou Branch of the Bank of China, to come to Shanghai together the day before yesterday to borrow a portion in advance to address various urgent requirements. After arriving in Shanghai, Cheng and Jin separately visited the authorities of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to conduct negotiations. It is generally expected that they can initially borrow a small amount of short-term funds to cover seasonal expenses. Cheng also stated that although the new public bond regulations have been promulgated, they have not been officially implemented, so the bond certificates cannot yet be printed and used. Although the seasonal festival can be barely managed, raising funds to cope with the year-end closing will still be difficult. It is now reported that Cheng still advocates issuing several million yuan of temporary subscription certificates to remedy the financial difficulties before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, is conducting large loan negotiations for 5 million yuan with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. After inviting Jin Runquan, President of the Hangzhou Branch of the Bank of China, to Shanghai to assist in the effort, the amount is said to have been finalized at 4 million yuan. The Bank of China will be responsible for 1.8 million yuan, the Bank of Communications for 800,000 yuan, and the Zhejiang Local Bank for 1 million yuan. Cheng is scheduled to return to Hangzhou today to report to the provincial government, and the agreement will be signed and established in Hangzhou this week.</p>

<p>Industries and Businesses Can Settle Accounts Adequately; Banks All Have a Surplus in Their Half-Yearly Financial Reports</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the Summer Festival (old lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival). According to custom, Shanghai's industries and businesses will distribute lists and settle accounts once. Industries and businesses have been quite busy with collections and settlements between customers and fellow businesses these days. For this festival's settlement, because all industries have strived for austerity and adopted a prudent approach to business, they can all cope adequately. The city's financial situation is also stable as usual. All banks and money houses in the city will be closed for one day and will resume business as usual on the 24th. The first half of the year's financial statements for all banks will soon be completed by the end of June. Savings departments stopped paying interest on deposits on the 20th, and commercial departments will stop paying interest on the 25th to facilitate the settlement. Most will be able to obtain a surplus. The Bankers' Association is scheduled to hold a general meeting of members at 4:00 PM on the 27th to report on the association's affairs for the past year and to approve the budget and final accounts.

<h3 id="e105">Ge Jiachen of the Woolen Cloth Industry Discusses Three Principles to Prevent Smuggling <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Woolen Cloth Industry Association, due to the rampant smuggling of goods, which has greatly affected the industry, sent Ge Jiachen to the Customs to visit the Chief Inspector of Customs, Moyler, to request consideration for the legitimate interests of traders and to assist in suppressing smuggling. Moyler expressed acceptance and said that the methods needed to be discussed at length. A reporter from Xin Sheng She interviewed Ge yesterday. According to him, the smuggled goods from a certain country to Shanghai only pay 7.5% of taxes (collected according to the ex-factory tax), while the tax rate for imported Western goods in our industry is 55%. Although our association has notified the industry to refuse to sell smuggled goods, the woolen cloth, silk, and cotton cloth industries have always sold them, so if we want to prevent smuggling, these two industries must stop selling them, or cooperate with our industry, which may be effective. Fellow members of our association have repeatedly suggested to the association that we conduct a thorough investigation of the products of domestic woolen cloth factories, that the authorities should send resident factory commissioners to check foreign factory export goods according to the methods of cigarette factories, and that goods from Manchuria and Mongolia should not be allowed to be transshipped; if they want to be transshipped, they should be handled in the same way as imported Western goods, and through bills of lading should not be given special rights. The association will submit a request on these three principles when it next meets with the Inspector of Customs. Recently, it was heard that goods from a certain Japanese factory were specially allowed to be released tax-free. The industry is currently investigating the truth to correct it.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Request the Abolition of Tea Transit Tax <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating, "To the esteemed officials of the Ministry of Finance: This month, the Tea Trade Association of this city sent a letter stating that tea is a major national product and a natural product. Internally, it is a daily necessity for the people, and externally, it is a means of promoting national products and recovering profits. Since foreign teas from Japan and India have competed in the international market, the sales volume of Chinese tea has gradually been eliminated, and it has become a spent force. In the past, tea industry groups in various places repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to implement tax exemption in advance and gradually reduce the burden. In April of last year, the Ministry of Finance issued a reply with Customs Document No. 590, stating, 'We have received your presentation and understand. We have presented the item of transit tax to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Central Political Committee for approval, and it will be implemented on a scheduled basis. The transit tax that should be paid for tea sold domestically will be suspended at the same time as other local goods, and it is not appropriate to abolish it in advance, which would involve disputes. Please be informed accordingly.' However, it has not been implemented for a long time. On March 22 this year, the Third General Assembly of the Tea Technology Discussion Conference of the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Committee was jointly decided by tea experts from various places to exempt taxes in advance, and they requested the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Yuan to help with relief. They requested that the original plan be investigated and that taxes be exempted as soon as possible. To this day, there has been no effect. The industry association stated that due to frequent floods and banditry in recent years, the tea industry has suffered great damage, and many have been reduced to bankruptcy. Even if they barely maintain the status quo, they feel exhausted. Therefore, we propose to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance to investigate the original plan of Customs Document No. 590 of the 24th year and to promptly exempt the domestic transit tax on tea in advance, implement tax exemption, reduce the burden, and maintain the national tea industry, which would be greatly beneficial." Upon arrival at the meeting, it was found that the abolition of the transit tax was previously hindered by the increase in import tax to offset it. It was planned to change the income tax to offset it, and the discussion lasted for years, so the date was delayed. Now that the income tax has been set to be held within this year, according to recent news reports, it seems to be very promising. In the future, the tax source for compensation has been secured, and tea is a special domestic product that urgently needs support. It is reasonable to cable your department to review and approve the request of the association, immediately abolish the transit tax on a scheduled basis, reduce costs, and facilitate sales. [We] would be exceedingly grateful. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Chamber of Commerce Cables Customs Administration to Request Inquiry and Return of Detained Jadeite Boulders <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>On the 19th, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating, "To the esteemed officials of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance: Chen Kaiqing's letter states that the Customs re-seized and punished a jadeite boulder that had already been taxed and fined. The original punishment was revoked a long time ago, and on May 20, the National Government ordered the matter to be forwarded. However, when inquiring with the Customs, it was stated that the order had not yet been forwarded to the Customs. On the 13th of this month, a request was submitted to the Customs Administration to expedite approval for release, but there has been no response. According to the official procedures, it should be forwarded to the Customs within a maximum of half a month, but a month has passed, and there is still no news. It seems difficult to speculate with common sense. Since the stone was seized, it has been over a year. The losses suffered as a result are enormous, and the mental anguish is indescribable. Now that the case has been finally determined, the stone should be returned as soon as possible, and there is no need for further delay. We respectfully request that your association forward the matter to the relevant authorities and request its prompt return, which would be deeply appreciated. Please also provide a reply so that we can inform them to complete the case. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this."</p>

<p>To Discuss the Implementation of Grade Inspection Methods for Raw Silk Products; Representatives from Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi Silk Factories Are All Preparing to Attend</p>
<p>After receiving instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to prepare for the export commodity grade inspection of raw silk, the Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection has been prepared by Miao Zhongxiu, Director of the Sericulture Group, etc. The key points and procedures for raw silk grade inspection have been formulated and sent to various silk factories and silk industry organizations for reference, and will be implemented on July 1. In order to facilitate implementation, a meeting of representatives from the industry associations of silk factories in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi will be convened at 2:00 PM today in the Bureau's conference room at the China Bank warehouse in Beinicheng Bridge to discuss implementation methods. Representatives from the three places have been designated by the silk industry association, including Shen Huachen and Huang Jiwen from Shanghai, Qian Fenghao and Cheng Bingjun from Wuxi, and Chu Huiseng and Zhu Jingan from Zhejiang. They are all preparing to attend. According to the representatives, the draft of the raw silk export grade inspection standards formulated by the Bureau of Commodity Inspection adopts the method of inspecting Japanese silk in the American market. Because of the different machinery in China's silk factories, the silkworm varieties have not yet been unified, and the workers' skills have not been properly trained, it will be difficult to implement universally after implementation. At the meeting, the reasons for the difficulties and obstacles will be reported in detail to facilitate discussion in the long term.</p>

<p>In Shanghai to Negotiate the Prevention of Smuggling, Will Return South Within Days</p>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Guangdong Province, came north this time under the order of Chen Jitang, Director of the Pacification Headquarters of Guangzhou. After returning to Shanghai from Beijing, he visited various industrial and commercial banks in Shanghai for days to negotiate and coordinate the prevention of smuggling. A reporter from Xin Sheng She specially interviewed Feng yesterday at Tang Haian's residence on Fukaicheng Road and asked about the news that Guangdong and Guangxi had recently increased troops on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi. He replied that he had only seen this in the newspaper and did not know the details. Feng continued to say that smuggling in North China has now affected South China. If this continues to spread, the whole country will be hit, which will inevitably lead to the closure of factories and the bankruptcy of all industries in various places. Although the government has measures to suppress smuggling, the people must also have organizations. The reason why I have visited various industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai for days is to coordinate the organization of anti-smuggling groups so that Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places can act in unison. Feng continued to answer reporters' questions, saying that the monetary system in Guangdong Province urgently needs reform. In the past, there have been consultations with the central government, and this has now been decided, but the date of implementation is still pending. I am scheduled to leave Shanghai and return south in two or three days.</p>

<h3 id="e112">General Bureau for the Production and Sale of Party and National Flags Replies to the Joint Association of Special District Citizens <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Details the Circumstances of Price Setting</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Joint Association, according to a letter from the 46th District Branch of the Association, criticized the high price of the Party and National Flag and forwarded the letter to the General Bureau for the Production and Sale of Party and National Flags, instructing it to reduce the price within the possible range. Now it is known that the Bureau has replied based on the facts. The original letter stated: "In reply, we have received your letter of June 18 and learned that the 46th District Branch of your association believes that the current price of the flags set by our Bureau is too high and requested your association to forward it to the Party and government organs to order our Bureau to reduce the price. Therefore, your association instructed our Bureau to reduce the price within the possible range to facilitate promotion. After reading it, we deeply admire your insight and clear observation. Because your branch has already recognized that the flag manufacturing technology sold by our Bureau is indeed more advanced than that sold by merchants in the past, and as for reducing the price, there is no evidence that the current price of the flag is indeed higher than that sold by merchants in the past. What is said is not necessarily flattering, but it is ultimately unavoidable by those who know. If the current price of the flag is the same as that sold by merchants in the past, then the fact that the technology has improved will become the target of reducing the price. Rewarding and punishing are reversed, knowing that it is unfair, but with the letter request, it is inevitable to inquire whether there is a possible range for reducing the price. Therefore, based on the facts, we specially describe the price setting process for your association. Since our Bureau was granted the power to produce and sell the Party and National Flag by the Central Party Department and the Ministry of the Interior, we have been working hard to research the suitability of flag making for printing and dyeing regulations under the supervision of personnel from the Party and government organs. The time and expense wasted were extremely difficult. Later, when the research was completed, we listed the value of the cost in detail according to the production and sales procedures and requested the Central Party Department to set the selling price. At that time, the flag price on the market, taking size 6 as an example, was 2 yuan 40 cents to 2 yuan 80 cents per flag. The Central Party Department cared about the people's difficulties and had already taken this into consideration, so it reviewed the cost and set the initial price at 2 yuan 20 cents per flag. The initial pricing was more than 10% lower than the inflated price of pieced and discolored flags sold on the market. Later, more ground feet were added, and then the public price was set at 2 yuan per flag. The current price is nearly 30% lower than the inflated price of pieced and discolored flags sold on the market. The thin profit is well known to the pricing officials. If the actual sales volume is different from the expected volume, the profit revenue will not only be insufficient to compensate for the loss of research, but also may not be able to balance the current expenditure. In the past few months, there have been many setbacks in flag making and flag sales, and the losses have already been a fact. Mayor Wu believes that the promotion of the Party and National Flag is enough to awaken the public's awareness of cherishing the national flag, and also knows that our Bureau is experiencing difficulties, which is indeed true. Therefore, he invited your association and other parks to organize the Party and National Flag Promotion Committee, relying on your great support and assistance, hoping to sell more than the fixed amount and make up for the previous losses. Unexpectedly, the 46th District Branch of your association did not investigate the facts and relied on likes and dislikes to take this opportunity to wantonly attack and criticize. Therefore, regardless of whether the current flag price is nearly 30% lower than the pieced and discolored flags sold on the market in the past, even if the current flag price is indeed higher than that sold by merchants in the past, the infamous name of unscrupulous merchants should not be added to our Bureau, which has no right to set the price. Fortunately, your association is wise and was not misled, and we are deeply grateful for your concern. We have truthfully replied. If you are prepared to issue an official letter, send a representative to visit our Bureau, and have further inquiries, we will naturally be happy to receive your guidance."</p>

<p>The Sino-British wireless telephone, since the Ministry of Communications ordered the International Radio Station to start preparing last year, has been several months. The International Radio Station in Sassoon Building, Renji Road, Shanghai, has used the terminal of the Liuhang Reporting Station to hold several trial conversations with the London Radio Station in the United Kingdom, and the results have been quite good. In order to make the technology more skilled, two trials are still held every week, each lasting 15 minutes, and the results are better than before. As for the formal communication procedures, the Ministry of Communications has directly contacted the British side to proceed and has drafted a communication contract and sent it to the British side to solicit opinions. According to a reporter from Xin Xin She, the International Radio Station is only responsible for all technical aspects of Sino-British communication. As for the formal communication negotiation matters, the Ministry of Communications directly discusses with the British side, so the communication date is still to be decided by the Ministry of Communications. At present, the technical aspects are all ready, and all other procedures are expected to be completed in the shortest time. It is expected that formal communication will be possible in the autumn of this year. As for Sino-American communication, the equipment has also been arranged, but because the day and night time between the two countries is opposite, the business hours are still to be discussed, and it is difficult to achieve for the time being. Sino-Philippine communication has been virtually suspended because the company responsible on the Philippine side has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government has now received an order from the Provincial Government stating that the types of miscellaneous taxes and levies on agricultural land vary from county to county, and the names are different. There have been many abuses in the collection over the years, and the amount is too small, similar to harsh miscellaneous taxes. The Department of Finance previously issued a circular to each county to investigate and statistics, list and submit to the government for approval to abolish. The county should abolish one type of miscellaneous tax, the fishery tax, starting from the 25th year (1936). The collection should be stopped immediately. Except for old debts from previous years, which are allowed to continue to be repaid, if any private collection in the name of borrowing is still found, it will be dealt with strictly according to law. County Governor Ye has ordered the land tax collection office of the county government to stop the collection from this year.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5 p.m., the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road suddenly received a phone call from Longhua Airport, requesting them to quickly dispatch an ambulance to the airport to pick up an injured person and take them to the Shanghai Orthopedic Hospital for treatment. Upon receiving the call, the hospital immediately sent a car. Around 5:30 p.m., an airplane arrived and landed at the airport. A young man in his thirties was carried out of the plane and immediately transported to the Fengqiao Orthopedic Hospital in an ambulance. According to the patient, who signed his name as Zhang Shi-qun, a native of Zhejiang, he had participated in the campaign to suppress the communists in Shanxi Province. He was injured by gunfire in both legs while at the front line ten days ago. He stayed in Pu County for treatment at the time, with little progress seen. Recently, he obtained permission from Zhang Benren to come to Shanghai for medical treatment. His relatives and friends in Shanghai had made prior arrangements with the Orthopedic Hospital. Therefore, he flew directly from Shanxi to Shanghai yesterday. After being admitted to the hospital, he was placed in room 30. After examination by Dr. Chen Jiayu of the hospital, it was said that although Mr. Zhang's injuries were serious, there was no major concern.

<p>The boy scout labor service in this city was held yesterday in the city center. Despite the rain and wet ground in the early morning, the boy scouts were not daunted at all, and their spirit was admirable. They worked hard all day and completed one road, which truly demonstrated the vigor of Shanghai's youth. Details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Participating Boy Scouts</p>
<p>At 7 a.m. yesterday morning, boy scouts from various schools and organizations, following orders, arrived at the site to register. They included Minsheng, Minli, Jinghua, Jinrong, Private Shanghai Middle School, City North, Guangong, Yucai, Daozhong, YMCA, City Chamber of Commerce, Sino-French, Qingnian, Tongyi, Shaoniantuan, Xiangxing, Datong, the Girls' Middle School of the Municipal Council, Huafeng, Renyi, Nanyang, Danhua, Yangjing, Qinghua, Siyu, Guangdong, Quanzhang, Post Office No. 2, Lida, Minguang, Gongyi, Dian, He'an, and other primary and secondary school groups, as well as more than eighty social groups, totaling two thousand boy and girl scouts. Under the leadership of Chief Commander Xu Guozhi and Commander Xie Yanbo, the entire group of boy scouts marched to the open space behind the Municipal Government to prepare for the start of construction.</p>
<p>Mayor Breaks Ground</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. sharp, Director Pan Gongzhan, representing Mayor Wu, arrived at the site in military uniform and performed the groundbreaking ceremony. Cannons were fired for the groundbreaking, and the ceremony was simple and solemn. After the ceremony, the staff directed the work of each group, distributed tools to each person, and assigned sections of the area. Subsequently, General Instructor Xue Juexin and personnel from the Road Management Office of the Public Works Bureau gave instructions on the work plan, and everyone began digging earth and carrying mud, not avoiding the wind and rain, with redoubled spirits. At 11:30 a.m., a siren signaled a work stoppage. Everyone used the dry rations they had brought with them to fill their stomachs. Tea and water were provided by the Municipal Government and the kitchens of various bureaus at the Municipal Government Auditorium and the dining area. At 1 p.m. in the afternoon, the weather cleared up, and spirits were even higher. Many citizens came to watch.</p>
<p>Work Achievements</p>
<p>Many hands make light work. With more than two thousand people "working together," the three planned roads were completed before 5 p.m. The road in the middle was named Zhirenyong Road (Wisdom, Benevolence, Courage Road), the road on the left was named Xingshan Road (Do Good Road), and the road on the right was named Fuwu Road (Service Road). Road signs were erected, and the boy scout emblem was added. The spirit of hard work and service of the city's boy scouts has left another glorious page in the construction history of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ribbon Cutting for Opening</p>
<p>As the clock struck five, all the boy scouts were assembled and lined up along the road. Tong Hangbai, a standing director of the council, inspected each road, and then the ribbon cutting ceremony was held on Zhirenyong Road to open it to traffic. Mr. Tong Hangbai rode in a car of the City Chamber of Commerce around the road for a week. All the boy scouts cheered and jumped with joy, forgetting their fatigue, and happily returned home by car, with songs still resounding in their mouths.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Chinese-owned Spindles Gradually Decrease, Yarn Industry's Future Increasingly Difficult, Japanese Yarn Factories Increase Spindles and Operate Day and Night, Factories in North China Still Shut Down, Requesting Relief <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese-owned textile factories have been affected by the economic downturn in recent years, and financial institutions have tightened loans, resulting in a gradual decrease in spindles. The damage is so deep that it is already in a difficult situation. The Japanese-owned yarn factories, which hold a superior position in China, are prospering, and the Chinese yarn factories in North China are still shut down. The reporter of the Dagong News Agency reported on the situation as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Current Situation of Chinese-owned Yarn Factories</p>
<p>According to a leader in the yarn industry, there are a total of twenty-four textile factories established by Chinese in various parts of the country, with approximately 2.7 million spindles. Since the Chinese yarn industry has been affected by the economic downturn in recent years, financial institutions have generally adopted a tight policy for loan recovery, because of the decline in industry, and have taken a very small grip on loans. As a result, the yarn industry has suffered a fatal blow in terms of economic flow. Factories that have stopped or reduced work have emerged one after another. Until now, not only is it difficult to restore vitality, but each factory is still reducing the number of spindles, starting and stopping work frequently, and taking holidays and stopping work for more than one-third of the time each month, struggling in the raging waves. The result of our only national industry is something that has never been dreamed of.</p>
<p>Japanese Textile Factories Increase Number of Spindles</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned yarn factories in China are located in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hankou, with 2.45 million spindles. In Tianjin, they have also acquired our Yuyuan and Yuda yarn factories and are expanding significantly. The number of spindles is planned to be temporarily set at 600,000. Recently, the Shanghai Internal and External Cotton, Nihua, Gongda, Toyota, Shanghai and other factories have increased the number of spindles by 150,000 since last month, operating day and night, and shipping goods out in an extremely busy manner. However, since smuggled cotton cloth products have penetrated into various ports in Central China, yarn sales have also been slightly affected.</p>
<p>Factories in Tianjin Still Shut Down</p>
<p>The Yuda and Yuyuan factories in Tianjin owned by Chinese were acquired by Japanese and rebuilt and expanded. The Beiyang Yarn Factory was also transferred to Japanese ownership, and it is heard that the deal has been completed. However, the Chinese-owned yarn factories in North China are actually only Hengyuan, Laicheng, and three others. Due to capital constraints, they have not yet started work. The manufacturers have held meetings and telegraphed the Ministry of Industry for relief. They also plan to borrow money from local banks to plan for progress.</p>

Each district submitted reports to the Federation for record.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Establishing Trolleybuses in the Capital, Joint Investment by Banking Sector Should Be Undertaken, China Construction Bank Company Replies to the Beijing Municipal Government <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The estimated cost of establishing trolleybuses in the capital is approximately more than 2 million yuan. The Beijing Municipal Government previously invited the China Construction Bank Company to invest and sent the construction plan to Shanghai for review. It is now learned that the company believes that investing in the construction of the capital's trolleybus business is feasible in principle. However, because it is a sole investment, its capacity is limited. Therefore, it has replied by letter requesting that the China National Goods Beijing Branch and other banks be consulted for joint investment in order to realize the above plan as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Concession Health Authorities Discuss the Original Intent of Milk Tuberculosis Testing, Preventing Glandular Tuberculosis and Bone Tuberculosis in Children <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the improvement of the quality of milk in this port and the Municipal Council's encouragement of testing cattle for tuberculosis, the measures taken by the health authorities of the concession have been reported in the press. Now, according to a statement by a person from the health authorities of the Public Concession, public opinion is still divided on the implementation of this new policy. Those who aim high and far say that Shanghai is far behind other major cities in terms of milk supply, and that milk should not be divided into grades at all, and only the best should be allowed to be sold. In fact, this kind of argument is still beyond the times and has not yet reached the time for implementation. Furthermore, the tuberculosis bacteria contained in milk are very different from human tuberculosis bacteria, and there is no need to discuss them together. The reason why the health authorities must encourage the testing of cattle for tuberculosis is, firstly, to maintain the health of livestock, and secondly, to hope to eliminate the source of tuberculosis in children's glands and bones from bovine tuberculosis bacteria. As for human tuberculosis, the problem is very complicated, and its relationship with milk is very small. The first method of prevention is to avoid contact with patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, and there is no need to worry about whether the milk has been tested. Furthermore, in May, three groups of cattle, totaling 110 heads, were tested for tuberculosis by the Municipal Council, and one head showed a positive reaction and was immediately isolated.</p>

Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.

<p>Quantity Exceeded the Shanghai Observatory Prediction, Low-Lying Roads Were Inundated with Backflow</p>
<p>The weather in this port this year has been particularly rainy and less sunny, and the climate is very cool. Although it has turned hot a few days ago, it has cooled down again since the 19th, and the sky is overcast. That night, there was a torrential downpour, and it rained intermittently all day the day before yesterday. Until yesterday, although it was the summer solstice, it was still cloudy and sunny, with clouds drifting past. The Huangpu River tide occurred again last night. At 1:23 a.m. yesterday, the quantity suddenly broke out as scheduled, exceeding the forecast of eleven feet, three inches, and five minutes. According to the investigation, the reason for the excess was due to the bad weather. When the outbreak started, the low-lying roads were inundated with backflow from the sewers, including the intersection of Gansu Road and Alabaster Road, the side of Yong'an Company on Zhejiang Road, and the front of China Sales Company on Sichuan Road. The high tide had subsided after 9 a.m. yesterday.</p>

<p>Experienced Four Provinces, Well Received by Local People</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Youth National Goods Promotion Group, initiated by patriotic person Liang Tongfang and others, departed from Shanghai by ship on March 24 of this year, carrying samples from major national goods factories, to promote national goods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in various provinces. Three months have passed. It is learned that Mr. Liang, the leader of the group, and group member Wang Jing, returned to Shanghai from Hankou on the Beisan Beixin Ningxing ship. They arrived in Shanghai at about 10 a.m. yesterday. According to Mr. Liang, the original plan of this group was to pass through the Yangtze River area, transfer to Guangdong and Guangxi, and go to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia to promote group goods. Recently, due to military changes in Guangdong and Guangxi, the work of this group was also considerably hindered. He and Wang Jing were forced to return to Shanghai temporarily. The other members, Fan Renliang, Zhu Xiaoguang, and Yu Tuan, remained in Changsha due to business matters and could not come with them. It is expected that they will also arrive in Shanghai within a week. Regarding the places where this group has been to promote national goods, they include Wuhu and Anqing in Anhui; Hankou and Wuchang in Hubei; Jiujiang, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Nancheng, and Lichuan in Jiangxi; and Changsha in Hunan. At the same time, national goods sample exhibitions were held separately, and people from all walks of life in each province were very welcoming to the group. This is enough to prove the enthusiasm of people in the interior to use national goods. We hope that major manufacturers in Shanghai will quickly find ways to develop the national goods business in the interior in order to gradually increase production and sales. After arriving in Shanghai, he plans to report the promotion work to the sponsors within a few days and plans to return home for a short rest.</p>

<p>Fei Jin, a 13-year-old girl, was harassed and angered, beaten and injured, and sent to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Gao Guangzhou, a 21-year-old man from Chengren, lived in the north of Zhongshan Bridge in West Shanghai. He was a worker at the Jingyi Wood Factory on Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai. At about 10 a.m. yesterday, he returned home due to business matters. As soon as he arrived home, he heard shouts from inside the house, so he pushed open the door and went straight in. He saw Fei Jin, a German translator from the factory (German, 23 years old), holding his younger sister, Xiaomei (13 years old), and refusing to let go. When Fei saw Gao coming, he immediately let go and tried to escape. When Gao saw the situation of Fei harassing his younger sister, he was very hateful, so he scolded him. Fei became angry out of shame and beat him into injury. Gao endured the pain and grabbed Fei and refused to let go. Xiaomei went out to report to the police on duty. The police took him to the Zhongshan Road Police Station, and then to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau for interrogation, because it involved harassing a young girl and injuring someone.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Famous Female Drum Singer Zhang Yueqin Commits Suicide <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Due to Deep Poisoning, Rescue Ineffective, What Do Parents and Lovers Think?</p>
<p>Zhang Yueqin, a woman from Beiping, is 21 years old this year. She is engaged in singing drum songs as a profession. She previously performed at Xiaoguanghan in this port. She met Wang Chenglu, a salt merchant from Anhui (34 years old this year), and planned to take her as a concubine. The price was agreed at 1,000 yuan. Recently, the woman came to Shanghai from Nanjing with her parents, Zhang Haishan (55 years old) and Zhang Zhao, and Wang lived in two rooms, No. 10 and No. 31, in the Xindu Apartment, No. 1 Daodeli, Beile Road, French Concession, to discuss marriage matters with Wang. Wang planned to pay 500 yuan first, and the rest would be paid later. However, the woman's parents, because they only gave birth to this daughter and rely on her to support them for the rest of their lives, had a dispute over the price, which could not be resolved. The woman, hopeless for her future happiness, suddenly had a short-sighted view and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium on the 19th night. It was not until 9 a.m. the next morning that it was discovered by someone. She was sent to the Pingmin Nursing Home on Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road by car. Because she had been deeply poisoned, the rescue was ineffective, and she died at about 1 p.m. The hospital reported to the French police, who sent a deep investigation. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue to wait for a member to be sent by the Second Special Court for inspection today.</p>

<p>Yangtze Silver Company</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Case of Suing the Vienna Dance Hall, the Original Plaintiff Was Ruled to Be Rejected <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, the Custom Should Be Followed, The Request for Rent Increase Reached More Than Three Times the Original Rent, Resulting in Failure to Evict</p>
<p>The Vienna Flower Dance Hall at No. 6 Dihua Road, Jing'an Temple Road, occupies an area of more than five acres. It was rented from the Yangtze Silver Company at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII on June 1 of the Republic of China. There was a contract with a limit of six months, and the monthly rent was 700 yuan. However, since the expiration on November 30 of the same year, Vienna has continued to rent, but no formal contract has been renewed. Recently, the Yangtze Silver Company entrusted a lawyer on March 30 to send a letter to the dance hall, limiting it to returning the rented land before May 21. Because the Vienna Dance Hall refused, the Yangtze Silver Company filed a lawsuit against the Vienna Dance Hall in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to return the rented land and bear all litigation costs. Lawyers Yan Chen and Jiang Baoyi argued that according to Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, "For an indefinite lease contract, although temporary amendments may be made, the custom that is beneficial to the lessee should be followed." According to Shanghai custom, the lessor can only claim termination of the contract if the lessee is in arrears of rent for three months or more, or if the lessor recovers it for its own use. The defendant has never been in arrears of rent, and the plaintiff has not stated that it is recovering it for its own use, only requesting to recover the rented land, which is obviously contrary to the above-mentioned custom. Moreover, the defendant has the right to use the plaintiff's land. According to Article 832 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff can only revoke the right of superficies if the arrears of land rent reach the total amount of two years. Therefore, the plaintiff's claim has no reason. Moreover, the filing of this case is actually caused by the plaintiff's failure to evict the increase in rent. In the past, the plaintiff would ask to increase the rent to more than three times the original land rent. In this autumn of a hundred industries, the defendant could not afford it. Repeated consultations failed to yield any results. The plaintiff ordered to return the rented land and even claimed that the defendant's investment in the construction and decoration of the rented land was more than 100,000 yuan. It has only been in operation for more than two years, and the profits have been extremely small. Now the plaintiff's claim is not in accordance with the law, it is completely a threat to increase the rent, it is really unreasonable, and the plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected, and the litigation fees should be borne. This case has been concluded after being summoned by the First Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Yuhai announced the judgment: The main text of the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected, and the litigation fees were borne by the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Jin Feng Recounts Past Hardships and Joys: Official Deals with Zhang Shi's Adoption by Contract</p>
<p>Zhang Shi, a woman from Chuansha residing on Jiangyin Street in Xiaoximen, adopted Jin Feng, the eight-year-old daughter of Chen Anhe, a leather craftsman from Jiangbei and neighbor, as her adopted daughter last year. At that time, she gave him 16 yuan for milk and food expenses. After Jin Feng entered her household, she told her that she had been sold by her father four times in the name of adoption. One was to a family of opera singers, one to a tailor shop, and one to people from her hometown. This was the last time. When Zhang Shi heard this, she feared that Chen Anhe would continue this practice and entice her to run away, resulting in the loss of both person and money. Therefore, she considered moving to be a good strategy and sent Jin Feng to her aunt in Chuansha to prevent any evil plans. Unexpectedly, Chen Anhe's evil plans failed, and he repeatedly extorted money from Zhang Shi, falsely accusing her of selling the girl and demanding 200 yuan. Zhang Shi reported this to the police, who arrested him at the Wenmiao Road Police Station and sent him to the local court. Zhang Shi went to Chuansha to bring the girl to the court. Yesterday, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu held a preliminary hearing. The girl went to court and recounted the above situation, saying that she had suffered greatly in Chen's house, endured hunger, and was only given a bowl of cold fruit to fill her stomach. Now, she lived like a treasure in her foster mother's house and did not want to leave. The prosecutor severely reprimanded Chen Anhe, ordering him not to habitually release pigeons, harass, or extort money. Since Jin Feng was adopted by Zhang Shi according to the contract, the court allowed Zhang Shi to take her back to raise her.</p>

<p>Shi Yang and Yu Sun Simultaneously Injured and Sent to Hospital</p>
<p>Shi Yang, a 41-year-old woman, and Yu Sun, a 31-year-old woman from Nanjing, lived at No. 121, known as 24 Jiantou, on Rihui Bridge, Xiaosha Ferry Road. They each set up a miscellaneous goods stall at the entrance to earn a meager profit. Due to their frugality, they had some savings. Therefore, both women had gold earrings made in the bank. Unexpectedly, they were targeted by bandits. At about 9:00 PM last night, as the two women were packing up at their stalls at the entrance, three or four bandits suddenly came and tore off the earrings from both of them, intending to flee. Both women suffered severe pain, and upon seeing their gold jewelry being robbed, they cried out in unison and desperately grabbed the robbers. At that time, the bandits had not gone far. Hearing the cries, they panicked and immediately fired two shots before fleeing. One bullet hit Shi Yang's hand, and the other hit Yu Sun's face. By the time the police received the report and arrived, it was too late. They first sent the two women to the hospital for treatment and then pursued the bandits.</p>

Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, she took advantage of the family's inattention and suddenly grabbed a pair of scissors from the table and frantically slashed her throat. Immediately, blood flowed like a waterfall, and she collapsed on the bed. By the time the family discovered it, she was already on her last breath.

<h3 id="e155">Second Annual Meeting of the Personnel Management Society <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Shen Jiucheng and Xiang Kangyuan Elected as Directors</p>
<p>The Chinese Personnel Management Society has been established for over two years. For the purpose of reviewing the past and encouraging the future, the second annual meeting was held yesterday (21st) afternoon at the Huahai Hotel of the China Vocational Education Society. More than forty members attended, including Pan Yangyao, He Qingru, Shi Jiuyun, Gu Bingyuan, Huang Jingwan, Yang Chongxun, Wu Zongwen, Zhou Mengyun, Lou Wenzhou, Wang Fugang, Ka Zongyuan, Huang Erxi, Chen Shouhe, Zhu Tongzhou, Gu Junquan, Shen Qinwu, Zhang Mingrong, Wen Chonglu, Xu Xingbai, Zhou Xinhao, Zhang Yiru, He Zhentang, and Su Changyan. He Qingru chaired the meeting, Duan Yaoxiang provided stenographic recording, and after performing the rituals, Chairman He Qingru first gave a report (excerpt): Today is the second anniversary of the Personnel Management Society. Members gather together to discuss the affairs of the association and to plan for its development. Details of the association's affairs have been detailed in the personnel management publications that were distributed today. Aside from the fact that the publications were discontinued due to the environment, the number of individual members has increased by more than 200, and the number of group members has also increased by more than 10. Other activities, such as the organization of visits to industrial and commercial organizations, have been conducted ten times, with ten to twenty people participating each time, and the results have been very good. In terms of publications, the Personnel Management Monthly is published every month. Although the scope is small, it is still a pioneering effort in China and can penetrate into the interior, serving as a source of research. Due to time constraints, there are still many association affairs to be discussed. I will not say more. Then, Pan Yangyao gave a speech, stating that the importance of personnel management is that one should pay attention to personnel management in order to seek the soundness and development of the organization. The defects of today's organizations are all due to the lack of attention to personnel management. I have traveled to more than ten counties in northern Jiangsu, and the failure of the supervisory sites is also due to this. If one can pay attention, it will not be so. Finally, he also explained the key points for various organizations to prevent corruption: leaders should often meet with subordinates, ensure that all subordinates have a comfortable life, and engage in proper entertainment. The decline of today's youth is the responsibility of the leaders, not the fault of the youth. The youth are like blank paper, and when they enter society, they have no bad habits, which are all caused by the environment. Therefore, when an organization uses people, it should first emphasize selection, and then enable them to practice proper entertainment and stabilize their lives. This is the only good way to prevent corruption. Today, I am very happy to be able to participate in the grand meeting and report my humble opinions. Subsequently, Shi Jiuyun and Gu Bingyuan gave speeches, elaborating on the promotion of corruption prevention and consumer cooperation among organizations, especially the promotion of welfare undertakings. Discussions then began: [Resolution to Establish a Personnel Guidance Department] Resolved: Approved in principle. The name and methods will be discussed by the Board of Directors. [Discussion on the Regulations of the Corruption Prevention Committee] Resolved: Passed. [The number of directors can be increased to nine, with three alternate directors] Resolved: Passed. Subsequently, the election was held. Xiang Kangyuan, Shi Jiuyun, Gu Bingyuan, and Shen Jiucheng were elected as new directors. Zhang Sumin, Zhang Yunbao, and Wang Weiyin were elected as alternate directors. Afterwards, refreshments were served, photos were taken, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Cai Jinjun's Radio Address: Hygiene Movement Must Be Practiced on the Ground <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, at the invitation of the 15th Municipal Hygiene Movement, gave a radio address at the Municipal Government Radio Station in the city center at 5:30 PM on the 19th. The topic of his speech was "The Hygiene Movement Must Be Practiced on the Ground." The content was divided into six points: National Health and Revival; Hygiene and Practice; Summer and Hygiene; Attention to Diet; Simplicity, Neatness, and Cleanliness; and the People's Efforts and the Supervision of the Public Security Bureau. Director Cai's original speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"Dear fellow citizens of Shanghai, the topic of my radio address today is 'The Hygiene Movement Must Be Practiced on the Ground.' When it comes to the word 'hygiene,' I believe everyone must think it is an extremely common and familiar term. However, it is precisely because it is too common and too familiar that we often overlook its importance and greatness. It not only contains the meaning of protecting individual life but also bears the great mission of protecting the life of the entire nation. However, because the nation is a collection of individuals, to achieve national hygiene, we must first achieve personal hygiene. To seek national health, we must first seek individual health. Especially in this era of extremely fierce survival competition in the 20th century, maintaining the life of the nation is indeed not an easy task. If intelligence lags behind, we will naturally be eliminated. If physical strength is insufficient, the degree of danger is extremely significant. Especially our country, at this most critical juncture of crisis, whether the individual is healthy or not is the key to determining whether the entire nation will perish. We should not underestimate hygiene as just a very common term that we have long been accustomed to hearing. We must earnestly recognize its great mission of maintaining national life and reviving national glory. Look at Hitler's National Socialism, isn't it advocating national health and national hygiene, the 'superior race theory'? The physique of Germans is already very strong, but they still actively emphasize this point to save the nation and restore its pre-war status, and they are still working hard starting from individual health. How can we, our compatriots, not be called 'sick men of the East'? Isn't our country called the 'sick man of Asia'? If we want to wash away this shame, if we want to revive our nation, dear compatriots, we must quickly recognize the significance of this hygiene movement and put it into practice. So, how can we achieve the goal of hygiene? How can we be considered to have practiced hygiene work? The purpose of hygiene is to maintain health and promote health, that is, to passively prevent diseases and actively strengthen the body. As for how to do it to be hygienic and achieve this goal, I think Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture, and education is relatively widespread. Most citizens have received at least elementary education. On the one hand, they read hygiene courses in elementary schools for at least one or two years, and on the other hand, they can often obtain some knowledge about disease and health from newspapers and other sources. How to do it practically, we know, but all kinds of hygiene creeds, such as diet should be clean, clothes should be neat, air should be circulated, and daily life should be regular, these must be paid attention to at all times and places, and continuously every day. It is because of this reason that people feel impatient and neglect it, feel unable to persevere and interrupt it, and finally bad habits take root and good habits have no way to establish themselves. In fact, this difficulty is only a temporary phenomenon in the initial implementation. After a while, when habits are formed, not only will you not feel troublesome and trivial, but you will also feel very natural and casual, and you can easily conform to the rules without much effort. Therefore, I hope that all compatriots, if they have not yet understood the meaning of hygiene, quickly take advantage of this hygiene education and training. At this time of extreme national crisis, we must think about the future of our nation and the lives of ourselves, and quickly make a decision to eliminate the small obstacles in the initial implementation and establish a neat, clean, vigorous, and healthy life. At this final juncture, it is not permissible to talk about any theories, and hygiene is not a theory that can be talked about. Dear compatriots, we can only quickly put it into practice. The terrible summer season has already begun. This season of high summer and early autumn is the most active period for all germs, microorganisms, and harmful insects, and it is also the period of general attack by our enemies. Therefore, according to the statistics of any session, the mortality rate in this period must always account for the highest number. The weather is so hot, which is also intensifying the active power of the enemies. Dear compatriots, quickly find ways to consolidate our defense projects and quickly strive to eliminate our multiple enemies. The most important effort is to pay attention to diet because this is where all germs parasitize and reproduce, and it is also the only way for all enemies to attack our bodies. This of course requires caution at all times and attention everywhere. And what I hope for today is two things that are very practical and must be done. First, shops or hawkers on the streets, as long as they are places that sell food, must have complete hygienic facilities, all covered with iron gauze cages so that flies cannot reach them and dust cannot enter, which will cut off the source of the terrible cholera. Second, the kitchen of every household must be cleaned up very well. Do not buy back stale fish and meat just to save money. Do not buy too many vegetables that are needed every day and let them rot. The tableware used should be rinsed with boiling water frequently. Discarded garbage should also be dumped in a fixed and remote place. This will also reduce the base for germs to reside. As the saying goes, "All diseases enter through the mouth." During this hot summer, we must all pay extra attention. To sum it up, the basic principle of hygiene is to require cleanliness: food should be clean, clothes should be clean, the house should be clean, and the doorway and roads should also be clean. And to achieve cleanliness, there is a key method, which is to be neat. And to be neat, there is a key method, which is to be simple. For example, let's take our kitchen. To clean it up, we must put all the things, vegetables, salt, oil, fuel, bowls, etc., in a very neat order, in a fixed place. And to maintain a neat and orderly state forever, we must not pile up too many things that are not in use. If a family has only four people, then four sets of bowls and chopsticks are enough. When guests come, you can take them out temporarily. If there are many bowls and chopsticks piled up outside, it will easily become messy, and once it is messy, it will not be easy to clean. So, things should be simple, only when they are simple can they be neat, and only when they are neat can they be clean. I often hear some people say, "Hygiene is something that rich people talk about. Our lives are very simple, and it is not easy to talk about it." In fact, this reason is not sufficient because hygiene is not something difficult to do. As long as you pay attention a little bit and be more careful, make everything in life simple, neat, and clean, that's it. This is not only something that every citizen can do, but it is also easier to do the simpler the family. I never like to talk about any theories, and the hygiene movement does not need to talk about any theories. The significant meaning of this hygiene movement is to hope that all compatriots in Shanghai will deeply realize the great mission of hygiene in protecting individuals and reviving the nation, and at the same time be shocked by the severity of the situation, and strive to practice it earnestly. Public hygiene and personal hygiene are closely linked and mutually reinforcing. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau should definitely do its best to supervise the public hygiene of the city, and the most important thing is that every citizen should realize, act automatically, and persuade others as much as possible at any time and place to jointly complete this important mission. This is what I long for from all compatriots in Shanghai today. In this hot atmosphere, and with the utmost sincerity, I hope everyone takes care and wish you all health and happiness."</p>

<h3 id="e173">Fierce Competition Among Countries to Host the Next World Games <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Netherlands Lists Eight Reasons Worth Noting</p>
<p>This World Games will be held in Germany starting on August 1st, and the venue for the next (12th) World Games will be decided at the closing ceremony. Countries are paying close attention to this issue, especially Finland and Japan are competing fiercely. As for the opinion of our country's sports authorities, they certainly hope that the next World Games can be held in China. If this goal cannot be achieved, it is considered better to be held in the Western District. Yesterday, our sports community received publicity materials from Finland for the competition for the venue of the next World Games, listing eight major reasons as follows:</p>
<p>Finland is a sports country.</p>
<p>Finland has sent personnel to participate in all World Games since 1903.</p>
<p>At the 1906 World Games in Athens, Finland won the first gold medal. In addition, in the track and field, wrestling, gymnastics, swimming, rowing, boxing, shooting, skiing, and skating events of the World Games, Finnish athletes have won a total of 62 World Games championships and gold medals, 60 silver medals, and 63 bronze medals.</p>
<p>In terms of total score calculation, Finland often occupies an advantage in the World Games. Assuming the ratio of population density is used, Finland is even more outstanding. If track and field is calculated, when the World Games were held in "Stockholm," Finland ranked second only to the United States. Since then, it has maintained its original position unchanged. In addition, at the 1911, 1920, and 1924 World Games, Finland won more medals in wrestling than the total won by other countries.</p>
<p>The 3.8 million people of Finland, united as one, support Finland's participation in the World Games. Its universality and number are unmatched by other countries.</p>
<p>Finland is a country that promoted sports very early and has specialized experience and knowledge in various sports. With the cooperation of government authorities and local authorities, if the next World Games are held in Finland, no shortcomings will be guaranteed in terms of economy, culture, sports, and any other aspect.</p>
<p>Finland is very close to the countries that have sent a large number of athletes to the World Games in the past, especially the travel expenses of European countries are more economical. Therefore, if it is held in Finland, athletes from various countries participating in the World Games will definitely be enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Finland is especially convenient for tourists, with lower exchange rates, lower living standards, beautiful scenery, eight islands, 60,000 lakes, midnight sun, and the Arftie seaside car road, which are unmatched by other countries.</p>

There were four types of admission tickets, divided into five yuan, three yuan, one yuan, and five jiao. The sale was entrusted to various banks and companies in advance, and the five-jiao tickets were sold at the ticket office at the entrance of the swimming pool, totaling 121 yuan. When the association sold tickets at the swimming pool the day before yesterday, a visitor donated 3 yuan of national currency as aviation patriotic funds. He did not want to publicize his name.</p>

<p>The League Champion is Covered in Wounds The People Are Delighted</p>
<p>On June 3rd at 9:00, the entire team departed from Solo and returned to Batavia by train. The train ride took nine hours, and the hardship cannot be described. As the sun was setting, they finally arrived at Batak and returned to the Asia Hotel. After one night, on the 4th, they fought with the current league champion "Ambon Youth Team" in this port. The Ambon team is known for its excellent communication, sharp forwards, and good fighting ability, and is famous throughout Java. Today, when strong opponents meet, many overseas Chinese are worried about us, and some tell us about the strengths and weaknesses of the other side, urging us to be cautious in our actions, which shows the deep concern of the fans. We have also been prepared for this. The arrangement of the lineup has been studied repeatedly. As a result of the fierce battle, our team's performance was superb, making it impossible for the opponent to figure it out. With a huge score of 7-2, the Ambon team was defeated completely. The overseas Chinese were overjoyed and elated. Our team's performance has improved considerably, the whole team has a better understanding, and they have not failed the expectations of the public in the face of strong enemies. They are also deeply gratified and fortunate. The players who played for our team in this game are on the left:</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang</p>
<p>Hou Jiangbai Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Xu Yahui Liang Rong</p>
<p>Zheng Jiliang Ye Beihua Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>The first half was 4-0, and the result was 7-2. The goalscorers were Guicheng, Jiliang, and Huitang with two goals each, and Zhenhe with one goal.</p>
<p>Although it was not a holiday, because the two heroes met, the audience was twice as crowded as usual. When the lineup was opened, we were deeply vigilant and coped with it step by step, without any negligence. In the first ten minutes, there were exchanges between the two sides, and the situation was tense. Then we saw Guicheng launch an uprising from the periphery, run fast with a bridle, and penetrate deep into the enemy's hinterland with a very wonderful pick-up, to a considerable angle, and swept the right side, the ball was strong and powerful, and broke the enemy's goal. With this first shot, our side felt more organized when kicking, the short pass of the forward was wonderful, and the enemy defended desperately, and a single rider attacked, also making a contribution, which was very obvious with our short pass in the middle, and then heavy troops were stationed in the middle to consolidate its defense. The two wings of Cao Zheng are even more active, and Guicheng runs fast, breaking through another barrier with a crisp foot, which makes thousands of fans shout good. At this point, the enemy guards and defenders tried their best to resist, and our strategy also changed accordingly. Finally, a reporter shot a goal from the middle, creating a 4-0 advantage in the first half. The result was that the enemy gave them a heavy blow. Fortunately, Lao Feng had the demeanor of a gentleman and did not care about it at all. He was finally judged to leave the stadium without evidence. For a time, the overseas Chinese applauded and praised endlessly.</p>
<p>Changing places to fight again, our offensive slowed down slightly, and the enemy team was still not dead and struggled desperately, but the clowns jumped on the beams, which was not a big problem. Every time they developed, they were calmly repelled by our army's rear defense. Not long after the battle, the reporter and Jiliang each took a city. Soon after, Yahui was injured, and the two sides fought with ten people. The defense was relaxed, and the enemy got a goal back as revenge. Xiao Heizhen had been thinking about moving for a long time. He dribbled the ball deep from the center back line and made a contribution independently, returning the color to him. Finally, we lost a 12-yard ball, and the game ended 7-2.</p>
<p>According to our team, whether the whole team or the individual, there are special highlights. The cooperation of the whole team has a fortunate understanding. In the past, the center back line and the forward often felt disconnected. Today, there is no such problem. The advance is all forward, and the retreat is also all backward. The response is flexible and the connection is wonderful. Personal measures are as desired. All eleven people have made special achievements. In terms of endurance, there has been obvious progress. After the game, public opinion recognized that the battle on this day was the most valuable and most exciting performance of our people in Java, which is true. And our recovery of the Nanhua forward line in this game is a true record since going abroad, so we have to try it again. This line has been working together for many years, and the understanding is pure and mature. In addition, Guicheng's performance has returned to its old appearance, and the offensive power is extremely sharp, giving the audience a great satisfaction. We also believe that this formation must be the basis for dealing with strong enemies in the future, and we must seek further progress. Even if there are adjustments, it will only be in one or two positions.</p>

<h3 id="e189">School Survey: Overview of Shanghai Jewish School (Part Two) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Administrative Overview</p>
<p>The school's affairs are managed by the School Affairs Committee, which is organized by Jewish residents. The members are all honorary positions. The School Affairs Committee is responsible for the construction and repair of school buildings, as well as fundraising. All teaching and educational matters within the school are fully managed by the principal. The school's teachers and staff hold a meeting every two weeks to discuss issues related to improving teaching. According to the principal, this type of discussion meeting is very helpful for improving teaching.</p>
<p>The school's funding comes from approximately four sources: tuition fees, donations, subsidies, and gifts. The school principal declined to disclose the amount of each source of income. The tuition fees paid by students at all levels are the same. Special arrangements are in place for students from families with many children. In each family, the first student pays a monthly tuition fee of seven yuan, the second student pays a monthly tuition fee of five yuan, and the third, fourth, and subsequent students only pay a monthly tuition fee of three yuan. Monthly tuition fees must be paid in advance before attending classes. On the expenditure side, the salaries and wages of teachers and staff account for the majority, while equipment purchases account for only a small portion. Outside parties often make designated donations or gifts of food to the school for weak children to enjoy on a regular basis. For example, more than 160 children receive free lunch at the school, and the lunch fee is donated by the British industrialist Sir Ellis Kadoorie and his wife. Therefore, photos of the knight and his wife are hung in the dining room. The school doctor's remuneration is donated by Dr. Rosenzweig, a Russian. Another person donates cod liver oil and malt extract to weak children at the school free of charge. There are also two people who donate milk for undernourished children at the school to drink free of charge. Most of the books in the drawing room are donated by outsiders. In recent years, the market has been sluggish, and the school's external donations have also been affected. The budgeted revenue and expenditure for this year is still expected to be in deficit by a significant amount of between seven thousand and ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Teaching Highlights</p>
<p>Children at the school must study three languages: Hebrew (i.e., Jewish), English, and French. Subjects taught in Hebrew include reading, writing, translation, grammar, religion, history, and geography. The purpose of teaching Hebrew at the school is to enable Jewish children to recognize and understand the Bible and common prayers written in Hebrew. Teaching Jewish history focuses on children understanding the past history of their homeland and arousing children's awareness of the spirit of the Jewish nation. The maps used in teaching Jewish geography are the latest maps of Jewish holy sites and Palestine.</p>
<p>The purpose of Jewish children learning English is to adapt to modern society and be able to make a living using English. Subjects such as arithmetic, geometry, world history, geography, drawing, and handicrafts are all taught in English. The purpose of teaching French is to prepare middle school transfer students at the school to use it as a second foreign language when taking the Cambridge University entrance examination in England in the future. Syllabuses or key points have been prescribed for each subject, and teachers and students can work hard according to these outlines. The school uniquely lacks natural science and physical science experimental subjects, and only has simple observation courses that explain the life of plants and animals.</p>
<p>The school has regulations for the self-study work of students at all levels, but the amount varies at each level. When the school regulates students' self-study work, it takes into account students' health and curriculum distribution. Upper-grade students have approximately ninety minutes of self-study work each night, while lower-grade students rarely have self-study work each night. Students who are physically weak can be exempted from partial or full self-study work with a certificate from the school doctor. The school usually attaches great importance to various examinations.</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Development and Calculation of War Expenses (Continued) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>"Four" The Development and Calculation of Expenses During Wartime</p>
<p>Since the Franco-Prussian War, the German Empire has often calculated the cost of future wars (Note 1) as a benchmark for expanding the amount of war reserve funds. Their estimation method was the second method mentioned above.</p>
<p>In 1890, the Prussian Minister of Finance and the President of the Imperial Bank, among others, estimated that the army and navy would require 500 million marks in war expenses within the first month of a future war. Afterwards, with each repetition, the amount increased. When estimating in 1906, the importance of wartime industrial mobilization was realized, and an emergency fund for this item was added, amounting to 1.4 billion marks. By 1912, the General Staff of Finance was established. The calculation of war expenses became even more serious and precise. According to the results of the department's calculations at that time, at least 2.25 billion marks of war expenses would be required in the first month of total mobilization. At the same time, the industrial mobilization expenses were set at 1.5 billion marks, and the economic emergency expenses were set at 750 million marks. The total of the three was 4.5 billion marks. This estimate was not far from the actual facts that followed. For example, from June 30 to August 1, 1914, before the war had even broken out, the average monthly mobilization expenses alone reached 1.675 billion marks. After the war broke out, the monthly war expenses required in the first year reached more than 2 billion. Thereafter, the expenses increased sharply year by year, and in the final year, the monthly war expenses required reached a maximum of 4.258 billion marks. If we compare the budgets of each period with the actual expenditures afterwards, we can also observe the trend of increase and the degree of difference.</p>
<p>Estimated amount of war expenses required in the first month of the war.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Reichs Archiv Kriegsnustung And Krieg</p>
<p>(Note 2) E. R. A. Seligman, Essays in taxation</p>
<p>From this table, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>First: The calculation of war expenses also changes with the change of the calculation period, increasing in a geometric progression.</p>
<p>Second: Although the expenses at the beginning of the war are lower than those in later periods, they need to be disbursed in large quantities immediately within a short period of time. Therefore, it is called emergency expenditure. According to the coping methods of various countries in the European War, most of these expenses rely on bank loans.</p>
<p>Third: After the war begins, the required amount of war expenses increases gradually. The trend also increases in a geometric progression.</p>
<p>Fourth: When the war is about to end, the expenditure of war expenses will inevitably create a peak. For example, the European War ended in November 1918. At that time, the war expenses of the United States averaged more than 62 million US dollars per day, exceeding all previous records. This phenomenon is probably the performance of the final struggle.</p>
<p>"Five" The Development and Calculation of Per-Soldier Daily Expenses During Wartime</p>
<p>If we use the third method to calculate the amount of war expenses required per soldier in a future war, then the difference between now and then will certainly be very large.</p>
<p>Before the European War, someone estimated that the war expenses required per soldier per day were 2.5 US dollars (Note 3). Someone also estimated that the war expenses required per German soldier per day were 6 marks (Note 4). This was the perspective of the early 20th century. However, after the outbreak of the European War, this estimate became problematic. Because at the beginning of the European War, the daily war expenses consumed by various countries, such as the United Kingdom, reached 9.5 million US dollars; Germany was similar to the United Kingdom; although France was lower, it also needed 8.5 million US dollars. At the peak of the war, the daily expenses were truly astonishing. For example, the United Kingdom had increased to 33.25 million US dollars, and France had increased to 11.1 million US dollars. Germany even exceeded the United Kingdom's expenses, reaching 34.25 million US dollars. As for the United States, the number was even larger: in the first two months of participation in the war, the daily demand was 15 million US dollars. A year later, it increased to 50 million US dollars. At the end of 1918, it reached 64.25 million US dollars (Note 5).</p>
<p>According to the daily war expenses spent by various countries in various periods, and then averaged; and then divided by the number of people mobilized in each country, we can obtain the standard amount of war expenses required per soldier per day in each country. Now we use various statistical materials and calculate using the above method, and the results are as follows:</p>
<p>(Note) The table is based on Seligman, Essays in taxation, Chapter 24, unit: thousands of US dollars. Based on the "Summary of War Expenses and Financial Resources of the European War" compiled by the Temporary Investigation Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, unit: thousands of Japanese yen. Based on E. Comerfurd statistics, see Zhang Yifan's "History of Disarmament Diplomacy and Warfare of the Great Powers," Chapter 2, World Book Company Publication, unit: 10,000 people.</p>
<p>(Note 3) Bogart, war costs and their</p>
<p>(Note 4) Ibid.</p>
<p>(Note 5) eligmap, op. cit.</p>
<p>According to Han's figures, the largest daily expense per soldier during the war was in the United States, estimated at 9.3 US dollars. The lowest was Austria, only 1.2 US dollars. The average is 2 US dollars per person per day, which is one-fifth higher than the pre-war estimate.</p>
<p>According to Japanese figures, the largest daily expense per soldier during the war was also in the United States, estimated at 15.8 Japanese yen. The smallest was Italy, only 2.6 yen. The average is 5.7 yen per person per day. However, according to Japanese scholar Hiroshi Shimozai, the average daily expense per soldier on the battlefield was 15.7 Japanese yen (Note 6), which is not much different from that estimated by Han's figures.</p>
<p>"Six" Future Prospects</p>
<p>Although the calculated numbers are absolutely inconsistent, their results all show a uniformly increasing trend. With today's high degree of military equipment and the dramatic increase in the consumption power of weapons, the scale of future wars will inevitably be larger than the European War. The war expenses required in the future will inevitably be higher than the European War. According to our following calculations, the increase rate of war expenses will reach more than nine times.</p>
<p>First: We first compare the recent military budgets of various countries with the military budgets of the European War, excluding the impact of price levels. The result is how much have peacetime military expenses increased? The answer is unfolded in the table above.</p>
<p>(Note) The pre-war military expenditure materials are based on the investigation reports of the League of Nations. All are final figures.</p>
<p>Today's village materials are all based on the announcements of the financial departments of various countries. The United Kingdom and Japan are the 1936 budgets. See "Where is the World Going" in Japanese, 1936 edition.</p>
<p>The unit is uniformly calculated in thousands of the local currency of each country.</p>
<p>The price index materials are based on the investigation by the Ganben Allied News Agency, see the same book.</p>
<p>From this comparison, we obtain several important arguments.</p>
<p>Today's military expenses of various countries have all increased sharply compared to before the European War. Japan and France have increased tenfold. Italy has increased fivefold. The United States has increased fourfold. The United Kingdom has increased about twofold. On average, all have increased three and one-fifth times.</p>
<p>Today's prices in various countries have risen only in Italy, Japan, and the United States, and have fallen in other countries. In principle, if the price level and the budget increase rate are equal, the qualitative military expenditure has not increased. If prices fall and electricity bills rise instead, then the actual increase in military expenditure is more than this number.</p>
<p>Italy's prices have increased threefold compared to before. Although military expenditure has increased fivefold, it has actually only increased twofold.</p>
<p>Japan's prices have only increased by one and a half times compared to before; military expenditure has increased tenfold. Therefore, after deducting the impact of prices, the actual increase is at least eight and one-sixth times.</p>
<p>The United States' prices have only increased by one and four-fifths times compared to before, but military expenditure has increased fourfold, so the actual increase is two and one-fifth times.</p>
<p>The prices of France and the United Kingdom have both fallen, but their military expenditure has increased. France's prices have fallen by three-tenths, but military expenditure has increased tenfold. Then the increase rate of its actual military expenditure is more than tenfold.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom's prices have fallen by five and eight percent; therefore, the actual increase in its military expenditure is more than twofold.</p>
<p>(Note 6) Investigation by First-Class Accountant Mori Takeo of Japan.</p>
<p>If we deduct the impact of prices from the increase in military expenditure in various countries, then the average of the pure increase is nine times. Peacetime military expenditure has purely increased fourfold, and the expense will naturally increase considerably when switching from peacetime to wartime. We might as well use a smaller-scale war as an example.</p>
<p>In the Russo-Japanese War in the early 20th century, according to the investigation by First-Class Accountant Mori Takeo of Japan: at that time, the daily expense per soldier per day was only 8 angles in peacetime, but 2.4 yen in wartime (Note 7). This means that wartime expenses were three times higher than peacetime expenses. Adding this peacetime increase multiple to the wartime increase multiple, the result is seven times. Then the war expenses of future wars will be seven times greater than those of the European War.</p>
<p>In addition, the strengthening of military equipment and the expansion of the consumption power of weapons are also the main factors that increase war expenses. Taking the total number of peacetime armies of the five major powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy as an example, it has increased from 1,918,000 in 1914 to 2,144,000 in 1932. The total power of naval warships has also increased from 28.17 million horsepower to 40.34 million horsepower. Roughly all have increased by one time (Note 8). As for the strengthening of the consumption power of weapons, the situation is very dramatic. Within the above-mentioned time period, the machine gun firing power of the French infantry division increased from 7,200 rounds per minute to 7,980 rounds per minute. The firing power of rifles also increased from 5,600 rounds per minute to 9,500 rounds per minute. The firing power of an artillery division also increased from 3.9 tons per minute to 14.5 tons. In the past, large aircraft could carry a maximum of 600 tons of explosives; now it has increased to 8,000 tons (Note 9). The more advanced this technology is, the greater its consumption power will be; at the same time, its own lifespan will be shorter. This not only infinitely increases the basic expenses but also increases its pure consumption. In this way, even if we combine the increase in this expense as being two times greater than that of the European War, then together with the former, it becomes nine times. In other words, that is, future war expenses will be nine times greater than the last time. If we deduct the increase rate of peacetime military expenditure and seek the increase rate of pure war expenditure, then it will also be five times.</p>
<p>"Seven" Trial Calculation of Our Own Situation</p>
<p>If this calculation is correct, then we can further try to calculate our own situation. If China is once involved in war, how much war expenses will it generally need? And most importantly, how much emergency expenses need to be prepared? Let us seek a simple answer from the following procedure:</p>
<p>According to the new salary quota standard of the Chinese army (Note 10), the average monthly salary of a soldier is slightly less than 14 yuan. Then each person only needs 4 jiao and 7 fen per day in peacetime (consumption of food, clothing, and weapons are all excluded). According to the experience of Japanese soldiers in the Russo-Japanese War, the expense needs to be increased threefold when changing from peacetime to wartime. Then the total war expenses required per person per day is 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen.</p>
<p>According to the figures reported by the Chinese government to the League of Nations, the number of active soldiers in China in the 20th year of the Republic of China was 1,624,282 (officers are excluded). Assuming that the calculation does not increase during wartime, then at 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 1 fen, the daily war expenses total 1,290,238 yuan. The first month would require 68,707,140 yuan. However, according to the statistics of the number of divisions and independent brigade regiments listed in the 23rd edition of the Shen Bao Yearbook, the number of active soldiers in China is at least 2,251,339. As Mu Qing statistically analyzed in his article "War and Economy," the number of troops mobilized by Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the European War totaled 12,640,000, while there were only 2,860,000 before the war, then the number of mobilized people during wartime will increase by 4.42 times compared to peacetime. According to this situation, if the number of active soldiers in China is doubled, there will be 9,950,891 people during wartime, then the daily war expenses required will be 14,030,791 yuan, and the first month will require 420,923,720 yuan. One month's expenditure, and only what is consumed by the soldiers, will be equivalent to one-half of the total budget of the country in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. If officers are added, and equipped with the latest weapons, and an attempt is made to wage a modern war, then the war expenses, even if the total annual revenue is used to meet one day's war, is obviously not an easy task.</p>
<p>According to the experience of various countries, within one month after the mobilization order is issued, the required military mobilization expenses, combat mobilization expenses, naval preparedness expenses, military supplies mobilization expenses, air force preparedness expenses, and emergency expenses of various departments, etc., should at least be equal to the total amount of war expenses for one month at the beginning of the war; this must be paid immediately at the same time as the mobilization order is issued. Therefore, it is necessary to make preparations in advance. Then, in our current state of financial deficit, what method can be used to prepare? This is a question that everyone should carefully consider and catch up with urgently.</p>

<h3 id="e191">The Textile Industry's Self-Salvation <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The warning signal of an extraordinary period, from the rampant smuggling in North China and the conspiracy of the strong neighbor in the background, feels that the entire national finance is being destroyed, engulfing the fertile North China plains, and holding the economic development rights. Especially the annexation plan of the textile industry and cotton-producing area in North China is most alarming. If the people's livelihood and clothing needs are to be controlled by it, the arrival of the so-called extraordinary period is imminent!</p>
<p>Abyssinia's demise! It was destroyed under the hard military invasion. Today, the strong neighbor treats us with military invasion as the warp and economic invasion as the weft, implementing a unified foreign policy toward China, which is a consistent continental advancement policy. The presence of military personnel in the various economic invasion organizations that steal the economic rights of North China, the commercialization of the military, and the militarization of commerce, all working together, are all carefully planned and aim to seize the real power of politics and economy. Our country's textile industry, which is in danger, has encountered an extraordinary attack.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of Chinese Textile Factories</p>
<p>Everyone knows the difficult environment of our country's textile factories. According to Yan Xiangjun of the Yujin, Lu, and Shanxi four-province textile management association, "According to statistics, there are now 4,500,000 spindles in yarn factories in our country, with foreign yarn factories accounting for 1,500,000 spindles and Chinese businesses 3,000,000 spindles, but in recent years, due to the dumping of foreign merchants and the sluggish sales of Chinese yarn, 1,500,000 spindles have been shut down. The remaining 2 million spindles are also struggling to maintain the status quo. If we do not seek relief measures, I am afraid that we will all go bankrupt, and the sales of foreign yarn are all over the country," and so on. … However, the four major textile factories of Baocheng Temple in Tianjin, which have history and status, have fallen into the hands of foreign merchants due to excessive debts.</p>
<p>The Economic Relationship Between Textile Factories and the Financial Industry</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, Chinese textile factories have been declining year by year, mainly due to the fierce dumping of foreign yarn, and sales areas, except for Guangdong and Yunnan, have almost been squeezed out. Moreover, due to frequent domestic droughts and floods, the purchasing power of rural areas has decreased sharply, and inventories have accumulated. They also suffer from high-interest debts. The closure of spindles and the suspension of work are heard of every day. Therefore, the fixed assets of real estate, machinery, and the circulating assets of flowers, yarn, cloth, etc. … are mostly mortgaged to the banking industry. Judging from the industrial loans recorded in the 24th Annual Business Report of the Bank of China, which increased by 10.88% compared to the 23rd year, it is historically considerable when combined with the city's finances. Textile factories in the industry occupy a very important position in the financial industry's investment portfolio, so the economic relationship between textile factories and the financial industry is even closer.</p>
<p>Textile Factory Measures During Extraordinary Periods</p>
<p>Our textile factories are almost concentrated on the coast, and are the first to be threatened by war. When the time comes, the enemy will use a huge army to blockade our ports, such as Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin…, cutting off our international business communication lines. It is inevitable that iron will run rampant in the sky, destroying the economic lifelines of industry, commerce, and finance, which are necessary for our clothing needs. Then, how to maintain the factory's life material so that it is not lacking; how to train workers and prepare wages to the full, these many pending conditions, if you are in the rain of bullets and shells, and then plan, you can't do anything. Regarding this point, the two textile experts in our country, Mr. Zhu Xianfang and Zhu Gongyang, have each made written claims, which can be borrowed from, and are also what the author wants to say.</p>
<p>Mr. Fang's claim:</p>
<p>"The textile factories in the treaty ports must transport raw cotton from the mainland, and their prices are higher than the value of local purchases in the cotton-producing area due to transportation costs. The finished products must be sold in the mainland, and the actual selling price in the yarn-selling area is lower: that is, the difference in value between the flower and yarn trade is already very detailed compared to setting up factories in the cotton-producing and yarn-selling areas. What's more, foreign textile factories use new machines, new equipment, and management personnel are extremely reasonable, and they are backed by strong funds to compete with them. How can they not be destroyed and are in danger! If you want to avoid its edge, you must concentrate the excess spindles in the city, choose the cotton-producing and yarn-selling areas, and urgently plan to move. However, this cannot be done without huge funds. It is necessary for the state bank to provide low-interest loans to help it implement it, so that it can survive and then prosper on its own. See (Textile World, Volume 1, Issue 1, My Opinion on the Regeneration of Chinese Textile Factories)</p>
<p>Mr. Gongquan's second floor:</p>
<p>"If a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools. In this fiercely competitive situation, it is impossible to compare costs and products with old and outdated machines. Our Chinese factories are short of capital and most of their machinery can be improved at any time. We can start by improving the spinning machine. Because the spinning machine in the spinning factory has the greatest relationship with the output, the product, and the most modern progress, the parts that should be improved are nothing more than the bell and the traction roller tube. For every 10,000 spindles, give 50,000 yuan in government bonds, which is enough to cope with. If a factory's spinning machine has already been improved, then the cost will be changed to other machines. As for the detailed plan for improvement, it should be jointly discussed by the government's technical personnel. The method of repaying the principal and interest of the government bonds can be repaid in installments. And the government and the financial community should quickly form a cotton trust company and restore the closed factories to operation in order to strengthen the fighting power of the national textile industry! If debts are involved, it cannot hinder government orders, endanger the great plan for national production. Even if funds are insufficient, for the sake of protecting the original national industry, it is also appropriate to issue huge government bonds, but there must be a reasonable organization and strict supervision, which will be of great help to the entire national economy."… See (ibid., The Crisis of the Chinese Textile Industry and Its Self-Salvation)</p>
<p>Whether it is a national bank, offering loans, or the government issuing government bonds, the urgent need for economic assistance is the same. The author believes that the national industry in extraordinary times is very important. Once a war breaks out, the import of cotton yarn and cloth will stop. The production volume in Chinese factories, not to mention self-sufficiency, is really far from the needs of the public. If the original spindles cannot be planned properly as soon as possible, it is also conceivable that all of them will be in a state of shutdown at that time. This is really a matter of great concern. The only way to deal with it now is</p>
<p>(A) The government immediately issues extraordinary period textile public loans of 50,000,000 yuan, which will be transferred and lent by various textile banks, and the factories will be quickly relocated inland, the machinery will be improved, and production will be increased.</p>
<p>(B) The government strictly prohibits the export of gold and silver, and strictly prohibits hoarding. It takes resolute measures to block foreign exchange and transfer part of the funds to textile factories to maintain factory operations and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers, and to prevent the people's clothing needs from suddenly causing panic.</p>
<p>In addition, the implementation of employee-shareholderization, military-style training, and family-style treatment will be further explained as follows:</p>
<p>One, the factory side of the worker's shareholderization continues to give bonuses to excellent workers, accumulate savings on their behalf, and when there is a small amount, give them stocks and advance to the shareholder position.</p>
<p>"Military-style training" The working class is ignorant and has weak concepts! Train them, instill morality, discipline them, and familiarize them with their skills. Absolutely obey the orders of the industrial and vocational positions to make the work tense! Military-style general mobilization.</p>
<p>"Family-style treatment" The factory and the workers have a close connection. Therefore, for birth, meals, death, and burial, we should consider the welfare of the workers, such as running nursing homes, nurseries, worker savings, labor insurance, and building public cemeteries, etc.… like family flesh and blood, so that the workers can wholeheartedly be loyal to the factory.</p>

<p>Last week, from June 15th to 20th, the market situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly, with stormy waves, rising and falling indefinitely. The trend gradually turned downstream due to squeezing more. The situation in the Southwest was peaceful and tense, and the smuggling problem will affect the incompleteness of the tariff system. The congestion of the market's bulls is actually caused by monthly swapping, and this kind of bulls is still formed by the old bonds before the unified government bonds. Every month, it is slightly lifted up, and the barrier is getting higher and higher. If there is no unexpected attack, it can still be supported. In addition, the current environment is uneasy, and the financing is tight, and it is difficult to press the money. However, the market's bears are also very considerable. I hope that the shorts will make up for it to escape, but I did not expect that although the period is near, the lineup of the shorts is still very solid. It is known that too much real goods flow out and cannot resist, and the bull front line is shaking. Looking at the past week, the market price is slightly higher, and the bulls will come out of the cage. The market price has fallen, and the shorts will rise to make up for it. With the environment unfavorable to the bulls, the shorts will eventually take advantage. Today is the last day of the futures in June, and tomorrow is also the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. The true air-to-air melee will have a competition. Last week, the Gui army retreated slightly, and it rose by about one yuan. On Tuesday, the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi was loose and tight, and the situation in North China deteriorated. Small 78 jiao. On Wednesday, there were many swap transactions, and it returned to 56 jiao again. On Thursday, the rumors were raging again, and the bulls gradually came out of the cage, and the market price fell in a straight line, from more than one yuan to two yuan. On Friday, the reading rose and fell, and the closing price was 47. The number was waiting to buy one or two million to raise the price, so that most of them rose by 78 jiao. On Saturday, the buying was still heavy, and the hope of peace was endless. The bulls were pouring out, and they were always tired, forming a squeezing more, and a small number of jiao to one and a half yuan. Although the market price of one week was repeated, fluctuating indefinitely, the result still fell by one yuan to one yuan and six or seven jiao. The total number of transactions was 5,000,100,745,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: 100 yuan for the transaction unit)</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Without hope, there is no effort; without setbacks, there is no progress. Therefore, failure is the mother of success, a step towards a higher level.</p>
<p>Extraordinary events require us to handle them with a "calm" attitude. Never constantly seek "sacrifice," which can lead to the wrong path of individual heroism.</p>
<p>The work of rescuing the entire national crisis requires a long-term struggle. It cannot be accomplished overnight. Therefore, today's efforts cannot be considered the end of the task, but require continued struggle tomorrow. If you only seek the pleasure of today's reckless actions and forget about tomorrow, you will be letting down the nation, the country, and yourself.</p>
<p>We must be fully prepared, determined to make the ultimate sacrifice, avoid empty talk, and be practical. We must use actions to prove we are not lying. We must strive forward, not backward.</p>

<p>Our country's cultural relics have long been admired by people of various countries. It is a pity that there is no large-scale museum for study and observation. Moreover, many private collections are unwilling to be displayed publicly, so the cultural relics of past dynasties are obscured. The current Chinese Cultural Relics Exhibition Society has collected more than 2,000 precious items, and since the exhibition was held on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai West, it has won a lot of praise. Among them, the incident of Feng Yu Tang Yang is particularly interesting, so I will study and record it.</p>
<p>Tang Yang is a model. The displayed Phoenix Carriage Model is about six or seven inches high and seven or eight inches wide. The precision of the manufacturing and the integrity of the proportions are similar to what I have seen in the past, although it feels concrete and subtle, there is no difference. When I saw it today, I felt the solemnity of the emperor's clothes, which still lingered in my mind.</p>
<p>When Empress Dowager Cixi was buried in the mausoleum, the royal procession was a grand spectacle of human life, glory and death. A reporter from the Times witnessed the grand occasion and compared it to Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty. (See the Beijing Telegraph on November 27, 1909). The newspaper also said that when Cixi's golden coffin was buried in the Eastern Mausoleum, it was initially carried by eighty-four people, and later increased to one hundred and twenty people. The ceremonial guards included three yellow carriages embroidered with dragons and phoenixes, all of which had to be burned in front of the mausoleum; the funeral expenses totaled more than 1.25 million taels. When the soul tablet was returned, a grand ceremony was held for the soul tablet to enter the temple. Everything was extremely grand. The yellow carriage used by the soul tablet was dazzling, and the road it passed was called the sacred road. As it approached the capital, the Prince Regent, leading the princes and ministers, knelt to welcome it at the suburbs, passed through Zhengyangmen, entered Daqingmen, and finally arrived at the Imperial Ancestral Temple, respectfully placed among the nine emperors and thirty-five empresses.</p>
<p>The yellow carriage used for the above-mentioned return was pre-made by the Ministry of Internal Affairs according to the regulations, presented to the Emperor for review. The carriage was six feet six inches square and seven feet eight inches high. The entire carriage was made of gold-embroidered yellow satin, and the top was made of gold leaves, with a total of ninety-nine phoenixes, and the soul tablet was a white phoenix. The bar was also gold-lacquered with clouds, which was extremely magnificent. This carriage was no different from the one used by Cixi during her lifetime. Around the carriage's base, in addition to incense and flowers, tea, fruit, and snacks were placed. Only the golden furnace in front of the base was specially set up for the return journey and was not available at ordinary times. The carriers were guards and servants of the Imperial Guard who were well-trained, so the carriage was stable and comfortable, more so than a "Rolls Royce," but not as fast. Bland and Backhouse's "China Under the Empress Dowager," said that Cixi often dozed off in the carriage during long journeys, which shows that riding in the carriage was comfortable. I am afraid that Victoria (Gu Hongming's name for Cixi) did not have this enjoyment at the time. Cixi lived an extremely extravagant life and died with great glory. The phoenix carriage was just one thing. Putting it out can also supplement the missing parts of "The Fragrant Mist of the Imperial Carriage."</p>

<p>— Jing Guan</p>
<p>Since the advent of movies in China, there have been detective films, but due to environmental factors, they have never escaped the fetters of case novels. They often contain elements of martial arts and supernatural beings, or like stage plays, focus on scenery and mechanisms, which are of course naive designs.</p>
<p>Someone once asked Cheng Xiaoqing, a detective novelist, why his detective Huo Sang was called the Chinese Sherlock Holmes. He said that if the detective was written as wearing a hat at a rakish angle, a black gown, a protruding belly, stained fingers, and like a street gangster, the spirit and form would be diminished. Moreover, detective work is based on science, and it should be performed in a brand new posture to be exciting.</p>
<p>What is written in the novel is the same as what is reflected on the screen, because the nature of film is more intense than that of novels.</p>
<p>Mingxing Film Company produced a film called "Fei Ling Ma" last year, which was the originator of Chinese sound detective films. Whether in allegory or in the strict and righteous enlightenment of drug rejection, it has achieved considerable success in art. This time, director Xu Xinfu continued his efforts and produced a film called "The Diamond King," which targets the smuggling problem, which is now of extremely important status. There is a criticism, so the consciousness is no less important than Emerald Horse, and there are two points that are commendable in his second creation: one is the proper use of small movements; the other is the prevention of old patterns. Regarding the former, we feel that in extremely tense situations, there are often extremely flexible insertions. It is not like imported detective films, which specialize in horror and bizarre events, causing extreme anxiety and stimulation to the audience. Regarding the latter, there are no chaotic chasing scenes, no unreasonable underground secret rooms, and no excessive failures that cause people to feel disgusted.

<p>— Zheng Qianxi</p>
<p>The tenth day of the month was the fortieth birthday of my friend Mr. Fang Shoushan. He specially set up a peach table and invited relatives and friends, which was quite creative, so I will record it. A few days ago, I received a short letter from Mr. Fang, which roughly said: "I have been bedridden for many years and thought I would not get up. Although I have lungs and stomach, there is no way to complain. I did not expect the suffering of pulmonary tuberculosis. I have consulted and taken Chinese and Western medicines almost all over the country. I have tried my best to recuperate and make a living. However, the disease has not only not helped, but has become more serious. Therefore, I know that medicine can no longer help. So I plan to dress up my wife and make preparations for death. However, on the way, I met a white-haired old man who saw me haggard and asked about my suffering. He also told me that the Shanghai Yisheng Pharmaceutical Company sold Yijincao, which is very effective in treating lung diseases. In various countries in Southeast Asia, I have often seen people with lung diseases recover after taking this herb. Why don't you try it? Why do you give up the near and seek the far? I was moved by what he said. After returning to my hometown, I found that the company was in Rendeli, Xilin Road, Zhaozhou Road, South Shanghai, and I immediately bought it and took it. In less than a month, my chronic illness disappeared. After recuperating for a hundred days, my health fully recovered. This shows that seeking medicine requires fate, and getting help requires predestination. Is there no certainty in suffering and happiness? I can only say that you are so beautiful and separated by a great sea, I can only look westward and be sad. Now that I am forty years old, I have prepared some food and wine to talk with you, and to ask for words of bitter and sweet to record my rebirth." This is also a self-congratulatory birthday. On this day, the guests all had something to offer. Poems, books, couplets and plaques were full of splendor, but limited by space, I could not record them all. But I recorded the words of bitter and sweet that Yuan Jiamei, a thirteen-year-old prodigy, answered at the banquet: "Medicine has wiped away all the sorrows, scholars come to the hall to offer praises, from the time that you have suffered, Yijincao called for your happiness."</p>
<h3 id="e202">A Record of the Leng Yue Painting Exhibition <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Bibo</p>
<p>Last Sunday, I went to visit my relatives with my family and Su Shengqing, and stayed at home for a few days. Just in time, my friend Tao Lengyue was exhibiting his famous paintings in the Park Library. I went to see it. There were more than a hundred points of large and small paintings. It was a feast for the eyes. Brother Tao was busy greeting and responding to people. When my wife and I arrived, he greeted us even more warmly. In addition to talking about his philosophy, he also pointed to the righteous hall straw and pamphlets to me, saying: "The red sign on it is the Zhou's order on behalf of the two staff members of the Ministry of Railways, Xia and Zhang; because most of the paintings were ordered when they were exhibited in the capital last time; this time, Mr. Zhang saw in the Su newspaper that he was going to open a daytime exhibition, so he specially asked his friends in Su to pre-order them." From this, it can be seen that his paintings are really appreciated by people; because when I was reading that day, the visitors were simply shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>On the northeast wall, there were four colored plum blossoms hanging. One of them was titled "Han Family Spring," and the poem said: "South of the Yangtze River and north of the Yangtze River are half sand and dust, and it is suspected that Zhaoyang is in trouble. How can I listen to the Qiang flute with sadness? Leaving the customs is not the spring of the Han family." The meaning is far-reaching, and the feeling of wheat and millet grows on paper. But now, please take a closer look at the painter Tao. The Great Wall, which is regarded as an important pass and a great project, is being torn down by friendly friends, who are unloading their tents there. Sigh! Painter Tao, please paint another "The Great Wall is not the Spring of the Han family" to awaken our group of sleeping lions.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: The Fine Rain and Slanting Wind Still Leave Traces; The Night Orchid is Not Quiet, and He Writes a Letter of Severance Alone.</p>
<p>When he went to school the next morning, he still walked the same way, and no longer walked the alley where he had picked apricot blossoms some time ago. He went there like this in the morning. When he returned home in the afternoon, he still came back as before, and he no longer had any fantasies disturbing his heart. When he got home, he felt much more settled, took a book in his hand, and could sit down and read it slowly. After two or three days like this, Guoqi suddenly had a thought in his heart. He hadn't seen that young woman for a long time. He didn't know if she was worried, angry, or even more suspicious. It would be good to meet her again, even if it was just this once, it wouldn't matter. If she was not disappointed in herself, but she abandoned her, it would show that she was too ungrateful. Although it was not necessary to chase after her, it was not necessary to say a word to abandon her and leave her. So, after a change of mind, one afternoon, he followed the route he used to wait for people, and at a certain hour, he walked towards that alley again. Sure enough, he met Jiang Menglan just at the entrance of the narrow alley. This encounter was different from usual. After seeing him, he suddenly stopped and his face turned red. But he didn't lower his head as before. Instead, he stared at Guoqi with his eyes fixed. Although Guoqi had planned to look for Menglan, after seeing Menglan, he didn't know why, but his heart seemed to be pricked with an stimulant, and he immediately stopped his body. At the same time, he broke out in a sweat all over his body, and he felt a burst of heat coming from his spine, suddenly jumping from spring to summer. Miss Jiang probably also had a sudden feeling, so she felt her face stunned. Although she didn't smile or get angry, she looked at Guoqi quickly up and down, and then took out the handkerchief tucked in her collar, held it in her mouth, and coughed lightly twice. It seemed that she had an unspeakable nostalgia for this alley, so she leaned slightly against the foot of the wall, lowered her pink neck, and walked slowly. Guoqi lowered his head slightly, turned his body, and walked slowly as well. But in the blink of an eye, in the embarrassment, he missed the opportunity to smile and greet her again. When Guoqi got home, he felt that he had done something wrong again today. How could he not show any respect after not seeing her for several days? Besides, her attitude was also very gentle and lovely. For this kind of woman, even if she couldn't be respected like the moon god Narcissus, she shouldn't be avoided like a snake or scorpion. This time, she must suspect that I deliberately ignored her and treated her as a snake or scorpion, then my sincere heart for her would be completely wasted. Then he had a thought that forced him to continue to go back and forth in the alley with apricot blossoms from this day on. The first time he saw her, he was very calm and walked naturally. (37)</p>

<p>The warm spring has passed, and the hot summer has come again. Some people say that spring is a kind and loving mother, and summer is a cruel stepmother. I don't care about such metaphors. In short, summer is indeed cruel, especially summer (?) is terrible!</p>
<p>Summer (?) is terrible, which is true, so recently, when it comes to summer orders, Yi Gu has revealed his cruel plan. Although the composition of the word summer comes from Bai and You, even if you and (?) all "hundred things, take "friend"ship as the premise to talk about affection and reason, but (?) insists on going his own way, and doesn't pay attention to you, what can you do!</p>

<p>— (Ya Chang)</p>
<p>People are always "stuck in their ways" when it comes to funerals and are unwilling to make changes. Mr. Hu Shi once advocated reforming it, but to this day, where is there any significant effect? During his time, Chen Meigong of the Ming Dynasty asked for paper and pen and wrote: "The great burial and the small burial are bound by ancient forms. Later gentlemen should be buried in clothes of the time. I am of this time! Do not use silk. Internal laughter and external crying, confused expressions, not a sound is heard, as quiet as an empty valley..." According to this, Meigong's view of ancient funerals at that time was that they were too restrictive, too hypocritical, and no longer applicable. Then, can they still be applied in the present era hundreds of years later?</p>

<p>Lychee, nicknamed Southern Beauty, the tree body is as large as a hug and as small as more. In the early summer, the flowers are light yellow, and the fruits are initially green and gradually red, with a round top and a sharp bottom. The lychees produced in Putian, Fujian are particularly valuable, such as Song Family Fragrance, Chen Family, Fang Family Red, and Jiang Family Green, all of which use the names of local producers to indicate the advantages of the lychees they grow. According to legend, lychees are also one of the betrothal gifts in Minzhong. From Cao Juquan's local bamboo branch words, we can know, the lyrics say: "Shy fifteen-year-old closed in the room, wind and rain jealous of keeping the palace, leaning on the dressing table with melancholy, the Lang family does not send lychee red."</p>

<p>Qiu Jie Jun said: Marrying a wife is clearly marrying a young bride, but she is called a grandmother. Isn't this the height of contradiction!</p>
<p>In fact, there are really many contradictions in titles. For example, the word "uncle" is confusing: the wife's brother is called uncle, the mother's brother is also called uncle, the husband's father is still called uncle, and the wife's father is still uncle. The same uncle, but the seniority is very different, which is really confusing.</p>

<p>— Zhi Qin</p>
<p>I read a Tang poem before, which has the line "A shepherd boy points to Apricot Blossom Village," but where this Apricot Blossom Village is located in which province and county is still unknown. Yesterday, I was bored and flipped through travel magazines to relieve my boredom. I was suddenly discovered a travelogue describing Apricot Blossom Village, but after reading it, the so-called Apricot Blossom Village has no beautiful scenery. Now I will extract one or two of the main points of the article to make you laugh.</p>
<p>Apricot Blossom Village is located two li outside the west gate of Chizhou, Anhui. The entire village has more than 20 residents. It has now been rebuilt into a school building by the local rural normal school. The apricot trees have been almost completely cut down by the villagers. There is not a single one at present, only its name remains. In front of the village is the Du Gong Temple, which is where the poet Du Mu is enshrined. To the west of the village is Duwu Town. According to legend, when the Tang poet Du Mu guarded this place, he often parked female musicians here to entertain merchants, which was an ancient place of gold and paper. Now, there are only maple red and bamboo green, woodcutter's words and fisherman's songs, and there are no traces of old events.</p>

<h3 id="e212">The Problem of Radically Curing Gonorrhea <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>It is not difficult to cure gonorrhea, but it is not easy to seek its complete cure and never relapse. This is because after the gonococcus invades the human body from the part of sexual contact, it reproduces and gradually spreads into the blood, causing various dangerous diseases and loss of life. The most obvious is gonococcal septicemia. If arthritis occurs, it is likely to become paralysis. In the past, sandalwood oil, cubeb, and other preparations were very popular, saying that they had the effect of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria after taking them. Whether or not they can achieve this therapeutic effect will not be discussed for the time being, but in terms of the medicinal materials they contain, they have considerable side effects on the stomach, intestines, and kidneys. Often, after taking them, they cause urinary retention and uremia, so this type of gonorrhea medicine is no longer applicable.</p>
<p>However, "Kelinong" is a highly effective drug for treating gonorrhea that is extremely suitable for actual treatment. According to its pharmacology, it is due to a special protein and animal and plant lipids, which are purified and made by scientific procedures. It is an outstanding complex yellow pigment preparation. It has a very rapid and great effect on treating gonorrhea, and has no side effects or severe irritation. It has a pure character. There are many counterfeits mixed with it, so when purchasing it, be sure not to buy cheap miscellaneous inferior drugs because you listen to others. Taking it will endanger your life. Be sure to recognize the three words "Kelinong." Since this agent is one of the protein therapies, Reruiz's experiment has found that it can treat gonococcal orchitis and see the swelling and pain disappear within a few days. The drug effect of this agent is extremely significant, so male and female patients, whether acute or chronic, and prostatitis, cystitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., can take this and get a full effect, and it will never recur. It is the leader of modern gonorrhea drugs.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Lingering Leukorrhea <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Only using Cardel Shetti can quickly achieve results</p>
<p>Lingering leukorrhea is the most painful disease for women. When this disease comes, day and night, white liquid drips from the vulva. When you are mentally tired and physically exhausted, and before the arrival of menstruation, this white liquid is more, the lower part is damp, eroded and ulcerated, affecting irregular menstruation, and abdominal distension. The only effective treatment for this disease is to use "Cardel Shetti's Vaginal Tablets." Take one tablet every night and insert it deep into the vagina. Wash it off the next morning. Because this tablet is good at eliminating inflammation, stopping secretion, resisting gonorrhea, killing bacteria, and flattening wounds, it can be effective quickly. However, if the patient is infected with gonorrhea from her husband, in addition to using this method to treat it, she can take "Kelinong" internally to purify the toxins in the blood. For those who are weak, they can take "Bu Nü Rong" internally to strengthen their body and prevent the source of the disease. If this is the case, the effect will be faster, and they can still have children after recovery. "Cardel Shetti's Vaginal Tablets" are truly the giant in women's leukorrhea medicine.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Reasonable Treatment for Lung Disease <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis often exhibit pale skin, irritability, malnutrition, night sweats, insomnia, flushed face, coughing, and sputum production. When measuring body temperature, they have no fever in the morning but a slight fever of over 37 degrees Celsius in the afternoon. Once the above symptoms become apparent, it indicates anemia, weakness, exhaustion, gradual weight loss, increasing fever, worsening cough, and increased sputum, sometimes mixed with bloody sputum, or massive hemoptysis, chest pain, loss of appetite, and difficulty breathing, leading to moans in bed. If pulmonary tuberculosis is left untreated in its early stages, it significantly affects life. Historically, drug treatments have been largely ineffective. Although calcium chloride injections have become popular in recent years, patients often find the numerous injections bothersome. However, with the introduction of "Bu Fei Na Er" by 法郞府 (likely a pharmaceutical company or brand), its ease of use and effectiveness far surpass other medications. This is because it is a compound preparation of calcium chloride, a specialized oral medication for self-treatment. It can promote the proliferation and encapsulation of mycin-eating connective tissue at the site of the tuberculosis lesion, supplementing natural healing. Moreover, its restorative power is particularly strong, exceeding the therapeutic effect of cod liver oil. Therefore, it exerts remarkable pharmacological effects on lung disease and weakness. After taking it, coughing and sputum are quickly reduced, bleeding stops, spirits improve, weight increases, and appetite is greatly enhanced. Consequently, all the aforementioned symptoms can be alleviated. Additionally, this medication is also effective in removing phlegm and suppressing coughs, making it a good symptomatic remedy for other respiratory ailments. It provides relief for whooping cough, colds, asthma, chronic cough with stubborn phlegm. In recent years, clinical physicians have favored this agent, achieving rapid results with a peaceful nature and no side effects, making it highly suitable for those weakened by pulmonary tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis is often accompanied by neurasthenia, insomnia, palpitations, dizziness, and lower back pain. Women may also experience irregular menstruation. In addition to taking this product, they can also take "Bu Nu Rong" to regulate menstruation and nourish blood. Men suffering from nocturnal emission and kidney atrophy can simultaneously take "Bu Ti Kang" to strengthen essence and nourish the brain, thereby strengthening the body and returning to health.</p>

<p>The Affliction of Prostatitis</p>
<p>Gonorrheal inflammation of the prostate gland is the most common complication of gonorrhea. Based on my years of clinical experience, over 90% of cases develop prostatitis, primarily due to the anatomical relationship. Whether acute or chronic, prostatitis is always a painful and dangerous condition. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>The main components for human reproduction are sperm and prostatic fluid. While sperm is essential for fertility, the presence of sperm without prostatic fluid is like a fish out of water; the sperm loses its motility and dies. Therefore, prostatitis, while initially a common symptom of gonorrhea, often results in the loss of reproductive ability. Patients not only experience pain but also difficulty urinating, with urine that is thin, small, and painful. This difficulty in urination leads to frequent urges, bladder distension, and lower abdominal pain. If left untreated, it can develop into prostatic leakage, damaging and depleting glandular fluids, which is a primary cause of infertility. In addition to surgery, I also prescribe appropriate oral medications to treat both acute and chronic prostatitis. The surgical procedure I use involves vibration massage, combined with anti-gonorrheal serum and electrical therapy. Patients also take oral medications effective against gonorrhea to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and filter out toxic substances from the blood. This often leads to complete recovery in a short period, with the ability to reproduce restored. However, if the patient is married, the wife may have leucorrhea (vaginal discharge), causing lower abdominal pain and difficulty urinating. In addition to oral medications effective against gonorrhea, vaginal suppositories must be used to cleanse the leucorrhea within the vaginal cavity. This treatment will also lead to a cure.</p>
<h3 id="e217">### Anti-Toxic and Membrane-Penetrating Bactericides in Gonorrhea Medication <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Gonococcus is a highly active and resistant bacterium that multiplies easily. Initially, it may only infect a small area of the wound or mucous membrane in the human reproductive organs. However, within two to four days, it proliferates into countless bacteria, initiating the destruction of the human body, which manifests as the initial symptoms of gonorrhea. Subsequently, the condition worsens and becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Without proper medical treatment, it gradually becomes chronic. At this stage, the gonococcus reaches deeper tissues, and although the external symptoms may appear to subside, the underlying danger is greater, making treatment more challenging.</p>
<p>"Ke Lin Nong" is the latest successful medication for gonorrhea, possessing the advantages of other medications without their side effects. This medication is pure and has strong membrane-penetrating, bactericidal, and antiseptic properties. It also enhances the body's overall antitoxic substances. As gonococci are primarily located on mucous membranes, "Ke Lin Nong's" ability to penetrate membranes and kill bacteria allows it to effectively target and cure all stages of gonorrhea, including prostatitis, posterior urethritis, seminal vesiculitis, spermatic cord inflammation, and orchitis. Furthermore, after taking this medication, the body produces its own antitoxins, making it difficult for even the most active and resistant gonococci to escape its control. Therefore, "Ke Lin Nong" is an effective medication for gonorrhea, widely popular in Europe and America, with its use in China also increasing daily.</p>
<h3 id="e218">### Stomach Ailments Arising From Overeating <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Overeating damages the stomach's function. Increased stomach capacity weakens digestion, leading to food stagnation, decay, and fermentation in the stomach, resulting in a state of toxicity, causing vomiting, nausea, chest discomfort, stomach pain, acid reflux, or diarrhea. Without appropriate treatment, this can turn into a chronic condition, leading to stomach heaviness, fullness after eating, frequent belching, reduced appetite, and even malnutrition, resulting in emaciation and pallor, often leading to the development of formidable pernicious anemia.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment, digestive and stomach-disinfecting agents should be taken in acute cases. In chronic cases, in addition to this method, nutrition must be provided to strengthen stomach function for perfect results. Among the plethora of stomach medications, "Qiang Wei Jing" produced by 法郞府, clinically tested and praised by famous European doctors, stands out for its unique effectiveness. This medication is a comprehensive enzyme formula containing Vitamins A, B, and D. Therefore, it not only effectively treats stomach ailments but also eliminates beriberi caused by Vitamin B deficiency. Furthermore, ordinary enzyme preparations do not contain nutritional mineral salts, which limits their effectiveness. "Qiang Wei Jing" is rich in these essential nutritional salts, which, when combined with the action of yeast, creates a synergistic effect, significantly enhancing its ability to stimulate appetite and provide nutrition. Its use as a year-round tonic is extremely beneficial. It can quickly resolve stomach ailments such as belching, acid reflux, aversion to food, chest discomfort, bloating after eating, vomiting, as well as intestinal rumbling, diarrhea, frequent empty gas, and constipation. The medication is also rich in lecithin, making it very helpful in quitting smoking.</p>
<h3 id="e219">### Endocrine System and Health <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Do you feel tired and weak?</p>
<p>The endocrine system is essential for life, and the endocrine glands are the lifeline of our bodies. All internal organs have glands that secrete fluids, which are the endocrine secretions. The most prominent are the reproductive glands and the thyroid gland. The fluids secreted by these glands enter the bloodstream. The stimulation of these fluids promotes blood production, leading to strong essence and blood, increased physical health, and mental clarity. Once these endocrine functions become abnormal, essence and blood weaken, the spirit becomes sluggish, the body feels tired and sleepy, and at night, there is a false sense of excitement, often leading to headaches, insomnia, lower back pain, and weak, powerless legs, causing sluggish walking. This is then followed by nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and other ailments, leading to a complete loss of health. The greatest damage to the endocrine function is caused by adolescent masturbation and premature or excessive sexual activity.</p>
<p>Mullen, recognizing the increasing number of people with declining endocrine function, devoted over thirty years of research and finally invented "Bu Ti Kang" for men and "Bu Nu Rong" for women. The raw materials are extracted from the hormones of young and strong animals. After taking these two medications, both men and women can regulate their endocrine systems, promoting the production of new blood cells and seminal fluid. Men suffering from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erections, and women with irregular menstruation, incomplete breast and buttock development, as well as both sexes experiencing premature aging, lethargy, weakness in the limbs, dizziness, palpitations, forgetfulness, and long-term infertility, will experience a refreshing spirit and a rosy complexion after taking these medications for a few boxes. All ailments will disappear, restoring the health of their youth. Therefore, "Bu Ti Kang" and "Bu Nu Rong" have become well-known, with people of both sexes competing to purchase and take them for disease prevention and health enhancement.</p>
<h3 id="e220">### A Collection of "Ke Lin Nong" Treatment Experiences <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Joint Swelling and Pain</p>
<p>Patient Yao Changchun had contracted gonorrhea eight years ago. Although it was once cured, it soon recurred and became difficult to eradicate. Pus would flow intermittently, and the urethral opening would be sealed with pus every morning. Overexertion would cause the urine to become more turbid and the lower abdomen to swell. He also developed arthritis, with red, swollen, and severely painful joints throughout his body, making it difficult to move. Walking was a challenge. After purchasing and taking four bottles of "Ke Lin Nong," the pus discharge stopped, urination became smooth, and all symptoms were reduced. He continued to take three more bottles, and the joint inflammation completely disappeared. He regained full mobility and, after six months, could climb stairs and walk long distances without any issues, becoming indistinguishable from a healthy person.</p>
<p>Spousal Compassion</p>
<p>Patient Yue Dazai contracted gonorrhea after socializing at banquets. The virus became deeply entrenched over time, with pus discharge occurring intermittently. He suffered greatly and transmitted the virus to his wife, causing severe leucorrhea in her lower body, with copious amounts of foul-smelling discharge. Fortunately, his colleague advised him to take "Ke Lin Nong" to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, relieve pain, and promote urination, which led to a complete cure in four to five weeks. His wife also took the same medication and simultaneously used Karer-Xue Di vaginal suppositories, an excellent remedy, inserting one or two suppositories into the vagina every night to cleanse the leucorrhea. She achieved a full recovery in less than a month. They have lived together without recurrence for years, and their marital affection has grown stronger.</p>
<p>Extreme Suffering</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Sufan contracted gonorrhea after engaging in illicit activities while intoxicated. He experienced bloody discharge and tea-green urine. The glans were red and swollen, the foreskin was retracted, the urethra was stinging, urination was frequent, and he felt a crawling and gnawing sensation in his penis, causing unbearable itching and extreme suffering. He also had difficulty urinating, with only a few drops coming out. Fortunately, a friend purchased "Ke Lin Nong" for him. After taking it for less than two weeks, urination became smooth, and the pain and itching were significantly reduced. To prevent recurrence, he continued to take it for two more weeks, leading to a complete cure. The swelling disappeared, and the urine became clear. Doctors confirmed that the disease had been eradicated.</p>
<p>Weakness and Cloudy Discharge</p>
<p>Patient Hu Fasheng had contracted gonorrhea several years ago. Due to neglect, it became chronic. The epididymis was swollen and hard, and cloudy discharge occurred intermittently. In the morning, pus would remain at the urethral opening. Urination was difficult, the abdomen was swollen, and he suffered from nocturnal emission. His body became increasingly weak, and his spirits were low. After purchasing and taking three bottles of "Ke Lin Nong," the gonorrhea was cured. He continued to take it to eradicate the gonococcal toxins, and he also took "Bu Ti Kang" to improve his physical weakness and treat nocturnal emission.

<h3 id="e221">### A Healthy Stomach Leads to a Strong Body <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Human nutrition depends entirely on dietary replenishment. If the digestive function of the stomach weakens, food loses its flavor, the amount of food consumed decreases, leading to malnutrition, anemia, and physical weakness. This can then lead to belching, acid reflux, bloating and vomiting after eating, constipation, beriberi, and other ailments. In addition to adjusting hygiene, the best treatment is to take "Qiang Wei Jing." This medication contains a large amount of vitamins and high-value ingredients such as yeast and calcium that promote digestive function. After taking this medication for two to three weeks, the appetite will be greatly stimulated, blood will increase rapidly, the face will become rosy, and all symptoms such as chest pain, vomiting, belching, and acid reflux will be cured. It is truly a holy product for strengthening the stomach, enhancing the body, and eliminating disease.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Gorky Passes Away <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Maxim Gorky, the literary giant with the world's largest readership, not only in the Soviet Union but also globally, passed away in the Soviet Union on the 18th of this month. This is a major event for the world. Readers around the world will no longer be able to see more magnificent creations from this comet of human liberation.</p>
<p>Gorky was introduced to China many years ago and immediately gained a wide readership. Every minute of his pulse and every breath he took resonated with the vast readership in our country. This was not only true in China, but also in other parts of the world. His entire physical and spiritual being had been dissolved in the blood of the oppressed masses worldwide. He became the sole comforter and encourager of hundreds of millions of oppressed people because he had become each reader himself.</p>
<p>Gorky is now a great writer revered by the vast readership of the world, but the beginning of his life was extremely tragic and also extraordinarily rich. It was this tragic and rich life that made him great today. Throughout his life, he attended formal school for less than a year. After that, he spent his precious youth in a long period of wandering. He worked as a railway worker, shoemaker, baker, and so on. In this long and complex wandering life, he deeply observed the concrete forms of all levels of society, which became the source of many of his later great works. His success in self-learning and building his authority in the world of literature from a very tragic life is almost a miracle in the modern world! Those of us who are currently mired in a life that is as tragic as his, should, when we mourn him at this moment, accept with the greatest enthusiasm the greatest and most precious lessons he left us!</p>
<p>On the eve of the Great Revolution, the Russian Empire, in a turbulent society and an atmosphere of leaping revolutionary flames, created a great signaller of human liberation, shining on the past of Russia and the present Soviet Union, emitting a compelling light to the whole world. What kind of weather are we facing now? We need a great roarer to appear in China now!</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Fallen <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Dai Li</p>
<p>It was a late autumn evening, and Wagnernev was walking alone on the quiet Avenue Joffre. He had his hands in the pockets of his grey overcoat, his head buried low, listening to the rustle of his footsteps as he paced along.</p>
<p>October in South China is not as cold as early autumn in St. Petersburg; it is such a beautiful and comfortable season! However, it seemed as if the climate had changed; he felt that even the severe winter in St. Petersburg was not as cold as it was now. A gust of autumn wind blew, as if thousands of flutes were playing from the tops of the thinning trees, from the end of the street. He couldn't help but shiver and reached out to pull his collar higher. As he stroked the already frayed overcoat, his heart suddenly sank, "If it's this cold in this season, what will it be like in winter? All the clothes will have to be put on in the morning before going out, won't they?" This thought stirred up another question that constantly lingered in his mind—</p>
<p>"Fifteen years, fifteen years! What about life? What about life?" He was confused, as if he would never get an answer. At first, he even thought, "When will I be able to return to St. Petersburg? When will I be able to attend that magnificent dance party in the Winter Palace?" But now, this thought had somehow broken away from him; he seemed to have been deprived even of the courage to think about it.</p>
<p>"Damn it, you bastard, Bolshevik"! He couldn't help but mutter under his breath and spat hard.</p>
<p>The road seemed endless, and his footsteps rustled incessantly. The neon lights on the decorated windows of the wine shops on Avenue Joffre were like the alluring eyes of a woman, reminding him of the rich aroma of Warga wine. He seemed to smell the wine and couldn't help but swallow a few times.</p>
<p>The gentleman continued to walk calmly, seemingly not hearing the plea. Experience had taught Wagnernevski that asking for a few cents, or if he was lucky, a torn banknote, required walking a few more steps.</p>
<p>He did not begrudge the worthless words and footsteps and followed closely.</p>
<p>"Sir, Madam, please give me a few cents, God bless you, sir..."</p>
<p>With a clang, a handful of coins poured from the gentleman's hand.</p>
<p>At that moment, the eyes of the urchins squatting by the sidewalk immediately lit up. They crowded together and ran over, reaching for the coins on the ground.</p>
<p>Wagnernevski's face flushed, the veins on his forehead bulging. He raised his fists and chased the children, but as soon as he chased one away, another would run back. After all, there were many children. They picked up all the coins and stood on the opposite sidewalk, laughing.</p>
<p>Wagnernevski trembled with rage, his eyes moist. He lunged forward furiously, as if mad. They chased each other, cursing.</p>
<p>"Ha, look at this Russian bum!"</p>
<p>Seeing the children gradually walking away and disappearing into the darkness in the distance, Wagnernevski came to his senses and clenched his fists, cursing in broken Shanghai:</p>
<p>"You pig! Fuck your mother's ×!"</p>
<p>Another gust of autumn wind blew, as if he had had a nightmare. Two lonely tears glistened in the faint light.</p>
<p>The street was very quiet. From time to time, a tram rumbled past. The bright streetlights cast a long, thin shadow of him. He puffed out his chest, straightened his oil-stained tie, and walked on.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>He could clearly see the houses on both sides of the road. Silver light poured out from every open or tightly closed window. He could hear the laughter of men, women, and children inside. Perhaps they were comfortably eating dinner, with salmon and roast goose on the table. He also smelled the strong aroma of coffee... All this was like the whips in the hands of executioners, mercilessly striking him, suppressing his self-esteem, causing him to lower his head again and forget to whistle.</p>
<p>In the distance, a couple appeared. Perhaps they were going to the theater or taking a walk after dinner. Their steps were so synchronized. The man supported the woman, whispering softly. Wagnernevski hurriedly walked up, followed them, and said in a pleading voice:</p>
<p>"Sir, Madam, I haven't had lunch yet! Please..."</p>
<h3 id="e224">End of Term <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— To Min</p>
<p>Wandering back from the South, I spent the winter at a friend's house, still unemployed. My friend was a clerk in a foreign firm, and his monthly income of twenty-five yuan was barely enough for his single life. Now that I, an idle boarder, had joined him, both of our lives were in a state of panic. Although our friendship didn't care about living in difficult circumstances, seeing my friend's pale face and often troubled look, I always felt uneasy. Almost every day, like a gold prospector, I patiently searched in all directions for positions that would at least provide room and board, but I returned every day with a disappointed face, only to be comforted by my friend with those contrived good words. I was really bringing harm to my friend.</p>
<p>So I began to pay attention to the employment section in the newspapers. From my own experience and the stories of my friends, I knew a lot about those attractive advertising phrases. But finally, I steeled myself to apply for a teaching position at a small school. Because the advertisement stated that it was a semi-voluntary position, providing room and board but only a few yuan for transportation expenses. When I read that advertisement, I felt that it was very promising for my current situation.</p>
<p>Following the address in the advertisement, I found the school in a small alley in Zhabei. It was a shikumen building, and from the front door, I could see the classroom with the Kuomintang flag hanging. According to local custom, the classroom was called the "living room." We poor friends knew a lot about this kind of situation. As long as the desks and blackboard were not missing, Shanghai had plenty of that kind of school. Without announcing myself, I walked straight into the courtyard. A middle-aged man wearing shorts and slippers was urinating in the corner. I don't know if my appearance suited the kind of teacher that small school wanted, but he blurted out, "Did you see the advertisement?" His disrespectful attitude was rare and made me very unhappy. I nodded slightly and casually replied that I wanted to see the principal.</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good!" He pulled up his pants and greeted me, "I am the principal here."</p>
<p>I was originally going to sit down in a grand manner, but since he was going to be my superior, I couldn't help but pretend to be polite and immediately asked his name.</p>
<p>"My surname is Liu, Mao Jin Dao. My given name is Guang, Guang Da Zhi Guang." He suddenly seemed to remember something and shouted a name behind him that I couldn't hear clearly. While doing so, he took out two crumpled cigarettes from his short shirt pocket, handed me one, lit it, and continued, "My school has been open for seven years, and we have many students. There are three more classrooms upstairs. An old teacher has left for a better job, and the manager he recommended was too strict, and the students' families often came to the school to make a fuss. They don't want to send their children to our school anymore..."</p>
<p>He recounted this story very smoothly, like a storyteller, but he suddenly stopped there. Just then, a school servant-like person brought out tea. He personally took the teacup and handed it to me, smiling and continuing:</p>
<p>"Sir, you are an understanding person. Reducing a student means reducing tuition, so I placed an advertisement to hire someone like the old teacher, hehe, do you understand what I mean, sir!"</p>
<p>Naturally, I understood completely, and I knew a lot about it. After we had settled everything, I asked him about the transportation expenses, which were not mentioned in the advertisement.</p>
<p>"This..." He didn't seem to have anticipated this question. After thinking for a while, he stretched out the index finger of his right hand. "The school is really poor. Just like before, ten yuan, ten yuan."</p>
<p>The school started in just three days. Two people managed the stairs. The students, when they came to school, seemed to be entering a park, bringing some food and chattering noisily in the classroom. They didn't want to study at all. It was best to tell stories every hour, or rather, every day. And our Principal Liu Guang seemed to be a story expert. He could tell stories about the dull son-in-law, the Dragon King's birthday, and Xue Rengui's expedition to the east.</p>
<p>He, guarding against my opposition to that kind of teaching method, said to me that dealing with those students was best done haphazardly, as long as they were happy and the tuition money came in. Last year's teacher was not lenient and almost sent all the students away.</p>
<p>Since I had entered a story-telling school, I also became a storyteller, but I peddled stories about Washington, Napoleon, and Sun Yat-sen, because I had to be worthy of the ten yuan a month for transportation expenses.</p>
<p>At the end of the third month, Liu Guang discussed with me that the fee would be paid in a few days. Since I didn't have much use for it, I agreed. But the fourth and fifth months were still owed. He said that he would pay it all at the end of the term. He was thinking of a way to make sure that there would be more students next semester.</p>
<p>About ten days before the end of the term, he left and did not return to school. The next day, bailiffs came to move the desks. Only then did I find out that Liu Guang had not paid the rent for four months, and he had run away himself. Ending a semester of storytelling life, I lived at my friend's house again.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Third-Class Ward <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>When I heard the news that Ren was suffering from typhoid fever, I anxiously discussed it with Qi and decided that as soon as we had some free time, we would go to the ×× Hospital to see him. Who knew that day after day passed, and we couldn't find the time to go see him. At the time, we really felt guilty, especially when we mentioned such a homeless young man during idle conversations. We both sighed for him and repeatedly remembered his story. One day, Qi went out early in the morning and called back around noon! —</p>
<p>"Ren's illness has reached a critical stage. You must come to the hospital once. Maybe this is our last chance to see him. Zong, come on, I'm waiting for you at the hospital now!..."</p>
<p>Without even having time to notify my colleagues, I jumped on the bus. The rush at the time was really impossible to recall. I had rarely forgotten everything like that before. Today was probably because the news was too shocking. After arriving in front of the Ministry of Finance, I changed to the bus to Dongshan, and only then did I feel a little more settled. At this time, I remembered this young friend who had no motherland, and everything he had encountered in the past few years. I had almost become neurotic. I remembered that it was only about a week before he got sick that we were still working on something very interesting together. His firm, stubborn, and strong words still remained in our minds and would not be forgotten—never forgotten. However, it had only been a few days, and a strong man was entangled by illness, and it was the very aggressive typhoid fever. Then, his wife sent him to the hospital, notified his friends, and asked his friends to donate money. In this way, not only did our interesting matter come to an end, but our happiness was also swallowed up by this disease demon.</p>
<p>The car stopped abruptly. As if something was pulling us, we jumped out of the car in two steps. A very grand and elegant building lay before me. It was like a dark shadow pressing heavily on my chest, covering my eyes. My heart was still very anxious, but my footsteps became slower, just like an attendant in a funeral procession. After notifying the gatekeeper, I turned a corner at the stairs. The stairs were covered with a carpet, and there was no sound when I walked on them in leather shoes, but I was even more careful, my steps becoming slower and slower, and my chest felt heavy and suffocating.</p>
<p>"Zong!"</p>
<p>A very familiar voice startled me. Like before, I didn't make a fuss, only using soft eyes to comfort her, meaning to advise her not to be too sad. However, my eyes were too foolish and had no effect at all. On the contrary, they were like a cruel executioner, drawing out her sorrow. She said, with tears in her eyes:</p>
<p>"Zong, there is no hope for him. The doctor said: If his temperature continues to rise, then no one can say for sure."</p>
<p>Ren's firm, stubborn, and strong words were shaking in my ears like copper bells again. I cruelly bit my own lips, begging her to accompany me to the ward to see Ren.</p>
<p>It was a third-class ward. A dark and small room, with four beds placed horizontally and vertically, leaving only a narrow aisle to run through sideways. The air was very bad, and I couldn't stand the sickening smell of medicine. I doubted that this would be a suitable room for patients who were not in a critical condition, but I had long heard that he was lucky enough to be moved to this almost second-class ward. Otherwise, a large compartment with seven or eight people would be even more nauseating than this.</p>
<p>Ren was lying on the bed against the wall. He was sound asleep at this time. His face, set off by the snow-white quilt, was old and dark, flushed with heat, very haggard, and a water bag wrapped in white cloth was placed on his forehead to reduce his discomfort a little. We suffocated in this terrifying third-class ward, not wanting to wake him up, and not wanting to leave him like this.</p>
<p>After a while, his dry lips moved a few times, and his dry tongue licked between his lips weakly for a while. Then he muttered deliriously:</p>
<p>"Life! Afraid of his tortoise, everyone fight him this time! Come on, come on, as long as I..."</p>
<p>I was flustered and a little out of control, and went up to cover his mouth with my hand. I was afraid he would say something. Rather than break the rules of the hospital ward, we woke him up. He opened his eyes with great effort, his lifeless, deathly yellow eyes. I was afraid to look at them, I endured the onslaught of all the pain.</p>
<p>"Zong, is that you?"</p>
<p>I stared at him. He was already very tired and couldn't continue speaking. At this time, I forgot that I had once cursed others for not using lies to deceive a dying person, and I began to say things that I didn't want to say.</p>
<p>Finally, Qi pulled me away from this terrifying third-class ward. We went back to the road. At this time, our topic turned to complaining about the third-class ward that could only kill people and not heal them.</p>
<p>After a few days of rainy and muggy weather. One afternoon, Ren's wife called, reporting to us simply, as if without any sadness: Ren is dead.</p>

When you left, you promised me, when the willows are green and the peaches are red, we would meet again. Why mention, the Dragon Boat Festival, celebrating the red pomegranate. Spring goes and spring comes. Autumn arrives again. The Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet through letters. Pushing open the window to view the bright autumn moon, Chang'e tightly closes the Guanghan Palace. Autumn passes again. Winter comes early. Cold winds blow in gusts. Hating the palace. Snow falls. Lonely woman fears the remaining winter. Hating the wronged souls. Such cold weather. May they not suffer loneliness. Must meet a kindred spirit with deep affection. If they don't come in this lifetime, so be it. Sending a sealed letter to cut off all communication. So that I won't always worry.</p>

<p>A scholar's favor is worth half a sheet of paper. An ounce of silver furnishes a Zen hall. Most delighted by the splendor of the Three Treasures Land. Meditating and listening to the explanation of the Vajra Sutra. The cuckoo sings lonely at my ears. A traveler's inn in a strange land is even more desolate. This place is, clear phoenix, bright moon, unattended. Resting and stopping at the Western Chamber. Sitting idly in the small pavilion, studying the principles of change. Reading books by the light of the firefly window. A pair of monks and laymen speaking noisily. A young maid walks out. To comply with Madame Cui's orders. A Buddhist service is held in the Zen room. First, the late Prime Minister's death anniversary. Please ask the monk to recommend him to the Western Paradise. On the fifteenth auspicious day, worship the Dharma King. Having finished speaking, he wants to leave but hesitates. Because of a love-stricken, powdered young man. Zhang Sheng approaches and bows deeply. Elder Sister, are you the maid Hongniang of Miss Yingying? I am, Zhang Junrui, a talented scholar from Luoyang. Using the temple as a study for the sake of marriage. Please report to the Palace of Rui Zhu. Say that I, still have no wife at home. Hongniang hears, her face changes. What you say is outrageous. It is said from ancient times that one should not speak improper words. A bookish gentleman dares to be frivolous. Old-fashioned people uphold principles of frost and snow. Three-foot children are not allowed to enter the central hall. It can be forgiven that a maid hears the words. The mistress will hate it very much if she finds out. From now on, think before you speak.</p>

<p>The Wednesday Experimental Little Theater held its second public performance at the Xinguang Grand Theater yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. The plays were "A Corner of the Metropolis", "Autumn Sun" and "Smuggling". However, when "A Corner of the Metropolis" was performed halfway, it was suddenly interrupted. The reason was that the concession authorities did not allow the play "Smuggling" to be staged, and "Autumn Sun" and "A Corner of the Metropolis" also had to be partially deleted and revised. After an hour of consultation, the theater finally demanded to finish performing "A Corner of the Metropolis", but because there was a line in the play, "The Northeast is our territory", the performance was eventually forced to stop. The audience sat quietly and waited, and the order was very good. Reality Experiment is immediately rehearsing a new play, preparing to be staged next Sunday.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan's "Lost Lamb" song has been recorded into a record by Baidai Company. Baidai recently auditioned it and specially invited Cai Chusheng, Chen Juanjuan, Ge Zuozhi, and others to listen. It is said that the results were excellent.</p>
<p>After the "Go to Nature" Ganpu location shooting team returned, they immediately shot outdoor scenes of the desert island wooden house for days. Both male and female actors were half-naked while acting. The location of the outdoor scenes for "Mr. Wang's Knight-Errant Biography" has been decided to be Yixing, and the special issue has also begun to be edited.</p>
<p>Hu Die will build a new house. The design has been decided, and it is the most popular and novel palace style, with a basketball court, tennis court, pavilions, long corridors, gardens, and clear streams. The building and the site are very tortuous and comfortable, just like a small-scale palace. It is said that the design of the house was designed by Wu Yaqing, a scenic designer from the Star Film Company.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi lost the pipe given by Hunan movie fans along with his wallet on the way to the factory to shoot "A Mother's Love Song" a few days ago. Just because the pipe was engraved with Zhang Yi's name, it was returned by the person who picked it up the next day.</p>
<p>Kunhe Tobacco Company specially made two kinds of cigars for "Mr. Wang" and "Xiao Chen". The one smoked by "Mr. Wang" is long and thin, and the one smoked by "Xiao Chen" is short and thick.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Ant Troupe Changes Repertoire <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The Ant Troupe held its third public performance at the Lake Society (Beijing Road) on the 23rd. The plays to be performed were originally decided to be the three one-act plays "Smuggling", "Who Killed the Baby?" and "Bugle". It is said that the play "Who Killed the Baby?" was not approved because the content was slightly inappropriate for this year's "Year of Child Implementation", so it was not approved. It is now said that the troupe has decided to replace it with "Poison", but because the performance date is too close, the situation of rehearsing day and night these days is very tense.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Wan's Photo Studio Special News <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

<h3 id="e234">"Little Tiger" Published <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Tianji's recent book takes the tragic life of Little Tiger as the weft and the social dark side as the warp. The plot is bizarre and twists and turns, and the writing style is lively and relaxed. Those who have read "Sweet Sweet" do not need to be told more. The entire book is a thick volume illustrated by Mr. Hua Junwu, which can be described as a perfect combination. The entire book is printed in letterpress, and each copy sells for three cents and five points. Published by Wenguang Bookstore, all bookstores are selling it.</p>
