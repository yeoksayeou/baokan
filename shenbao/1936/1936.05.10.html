<p>梅津宣布年購軍火二百餘萬元　陸海相則謂其他不能公開宣布</p>
<p>（東京）衆議院九日上午九時十分續開預算總會、民政黨櫻內兵五郞先爲質問、首相昨日聲明、日俄關係大體可望渡過難關、然首相曾於齋藤內閣時、言明日俄間各項事伴俟次解决、又於岡田內閣時斷言决無戰事、首相决意程度何故如斯變化、</p>
<p>廣田首相答、本入信念一貫不變、然蘇俄次第增加遠東兵力、與從前情形不同、因此日俄外交亦不得不考慮蘇俄兵力、而逐一解决事件、僅關於此事而論、則無戰爭危險、又在此意義上、可謂大體得經過難關、</p>
<p>櫻內又追問、調整日俄關係之和平的手段如何、</p>
<p>有田外相答、日俄關係缺乏明朗性、旣在演說外交方針時說明、蘇俄對日本缺其認識、又抱隱疑、然因外交爲擬於每個塲合適宜實行處置、</p>
<p>櫻內問、外交一元化之問題、</p>
<p>首相答謂、外交責任者爲外務大臣、無論在過去或將來、外交問題應爲外務大臣統一、</p>
<p>櫻內其次關於世界資源再分割及移民問題等、與有田外相問題後、言及陸軍北進政策、與海軍南進政策之調整問題、寺內陸相答、日本國策、期待國民發達、同時維持東亞和平、貢獻於世界和平、陸海軍在此限度內、分擔使命、並無所謂北進或南進等政策、</p>
<p>櫻內其次質問華北問題、有田外相表示對華决意謂、華北爲日滿兩國利害密接之地、故日本對華北有重大關心、並企圖其發達、</p>
<p>櫻井氏質問完畢、繼由政友會大口喜六起立質問、將來國費一路膨脹、請明確說明其經費來源、</p>
<p>馬塲藏相答、據余意見、除以伸張產業貿易、企圖財政强化之外、無他方法、</p>
<p>大口非難中央地方負擔均衡及軍需工業與關稅政策之關係、並謂、現內閣始終發出空虛聲明、</p>
<p>大口氏其次質問軍需工業問題、</p>
<p>永野海相對此答所謂、由海軍關係機關支付外國之欵項、十一年度有二千二百萬元、此係全體經費之百分之五、</p>
<p>陸軍次官梅津亦答、陸軍由外國購買兵器、每年支付三十萬元左右、經民閒商人購買者約有二百萬元、</p>
<p>大口轉其議題、力說農村之工業化後、進行檢討增稅問題、</p>
<p>馬塲藏相答、余力避實施賣藥稅、印花稅、織物消費稅等大衆課稅、</p>
<p>大口續言謂、樹立今後財政計劃、先行决定陸海軍計劃爲必要、謂將此財政計劃表、在議會中發表、</p>

<p>政友之植原悅二郞述及解嚴問題及改善議會制度、當有設立常設委員會之必要並謂、任命軍部大臣、須經軍部內諾、此項慣例、實屬不妥、世上傳說、政府與軍部之意見、每於同一問題、頗有對立形勢、殊覺可悲、究係若何、</p>
<p>首相答、此項輿論、或許有之、但今後當盡力免除此種形勢、</p>
<p>植原氏復關於調査局之存在問題、向有田外相質問、關於日蘇關係、外相謂當使之理解、日本迄今究採取若何步驟、外相答、具體上之辦法雖未便言明、但今後須竭力便蘇聯方面除去其疑心暗鬼耳植原氏又謂、確立外交政策、乃今日最大之問題、故希望不受任何侵犯當以决死之精神、依照聲明行之、調整中日外交、係以通商貿易之觀點、而誘導中國、究應若何、</p>
<p>外相答、此事雖須相當考慮、但覺未便多談、請觀今後之實行可也、</p>
<p>植原氏復對於防共問題、有所質問、</p>
<p>外相答、中日滿共同之工作、實有必耍、關於擁護通商、當以和平合理之手段、與堅固之决心、以謀解决、</p>

<p>（東京）貴族院本日上午十時七分開全體會議、將航空法改正法案附託委員會後、開始質問、</p>
<p>加藤政之助最先登壇謂、廣田內閣標榜一掃積弊、然以主張廢止漢字之平生氏爲文相、至爲矛盾、廢止漢字之主義、與大東文化學院斯文會等東方文化研究機關之宗旨背馳、又天皇頒發詔書、亦應以假名（日本字母）寫乎、</p>
<p>平生文相答、余非主張漢字論者、如適當整理漢字、則可以救濟苦於負過重敎育費之地方自治團體也、文相於是說明其多年研究廢止漢字之效能、</p>
<p>藤要求文相停止分配廢止漢字論之小冊子、</p>
<p>文相答以考慮之、</p>
<p>其次松井茂登壇發言謂、廣田首相言明統治權主體爲天皇、此爲當然之事、政府應研究方法、由敎育的立塲、普及此事於一般國民間、</p>
<p>於是關於國民精神力說部落或五人制度之復活、最後論文武一致打破財閥全權、言論公正等、各相對此均表示同意、零時四十分散會、（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本外相有田、昨在該國衆院發表外交方針之後、泰晤士報頃發表社論、加以批評、其標題爲「日本在亞洲大陸、」略謂、此項演說詞、涉及蘇俄之處、雖甚溫和、其關於中國北部一層、、本畏懼共產黨、雖屬實情、「特恐善於利用機會之徒、假借共產黨之威脅、以爲取便之計耳」云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 國立編譯館專任編譯陳可忠</p>
<p>第三對於實騐，我們應當養成淸潔敏捷和謹愼的習慣。前面已經講過，化學是一種實騐的科學，離開了實騐和觀察，就不能談化學，所以實騐對於學生程度的進展，是極端重要的。要做實騐，必須養成淸潔敏捷和謹愼的習慣，因爲如果不淸潔，往往會得不到正確的結果。從前有一個德國著名化學家V.meyer，他有一次在講演苯和Isatin應得藍色反應的時候，就當場做個實騐給學生看看，結果屢試不騐，他在事前曾經歷試不爽，但當表演的時候，忽然失收，後來他的助敎吿訴他，從前用的笨，都是從煤膏裏提出來的，這次所用的苯，是在實騐室自己由別的物質製成的。煤膏裏面所提出來的苯，其中含有雜質，實騐室製成的笨，是純粹的，以前所　籃色的反應，不免苯的反應，乃是其中雜質的反應。由此可見所用的藥品不純凈必定影響到實騐的結果，做化學實騐的人，如果不養成淸潔的習慣，這種不正確的結果，就會隨時發生的。不過Meyer是一個第一流化學家，他後來反而拿着這個錯誤去研究何以不純的笨，能够和Isatin產生藍色的反應，結果他發明了一硫二烯五圖Thiophen。）。說到敏捷一層，當然是一種極重耍的習慣，因爲敏捷就是代表你的手續純熟，手續一純熟才能够得到滿意的結果，這就是俗語，所謂「熟能生巧」。至於謹愼一層，允其楚應當注意，因爲如果不謹愼的話，不特實騐常遭失敗，並且還有發生危險的可能。舉個例來說，最近廣西大學有一位化學敎授，對於炸藥的研究非常有經騐，一天他正在試騐多量的炸藥，他的太太偶然來到實騐室去看他，當他轉過頭來時，一不當心，炸藥掉下地來轟然爆炸，結果不僅他自己慘遭炸死，同時他的太太也受了重傷。本來像這樣用多量炸藥來做試騐是不妥當的。但是道位敎授自恃經騐豐富，以爲不成問題，結果慘遭了殺身之禍。像他這樣有經騐的化學敎授，尙因偶然的疏忽，而得到了這樣悲慘的結果，那末初學的對於一切實騐，當然更要謹愼了。</p>
<p>關於學習化學應取的態度，第一我們應當有求知慾。化學這種科學，不僅與人生衣食住行有密切的關係，同時並可用來發覺自然界的神秘。從前視爲神秘的事實，現在用化學方法都可以慢慢的發現出來。譬如拿物產方面來說，有許多東西不僅可用人工製造，並且造出來的東西還要比較天然的產品好得多。許多重要的化學發明，差不多都是從化學家的「求知慾」得來，一個人有了求知慾，對於所學的東西，才會發生與趣，不致一遇困難，便意志消沈，不求深解，化學是探討自然界神秘事實的鎖鑰，而能够把握這種鎖鑰的，只有極富於求知慾的人。我們假如要想在化學方面有相當的成功。這種求知慾是應當注意培養的。</p>
<p>第二我們應當養成崇實和精確的習慣。求學的人應當崇實，大家當然都很贊成這話，但是對於精確二字，我們何以要特別注重，初學化學的人，未必都能明瞭。現在我舉一個例，諸位就知道研究化學的人，何以不能不養成精確的習慣。一七八五年當Cavendish測定空氣的組成的時候，他把尋常空氣和氧混合，然後通電，使空氣裏面的氮，完全和氣化合除去，他雖屢次試騐，瓶子裏面總有少景的氣體不能够除盡；他以爲這一點的氣體，對於空氣成分的研究，沒有多大影響，因此也就漫然置之，一百年以後這種少量的氣體，又經Rayleigh和Ramsey兩位化學家努力的研究，結果竟發現了氬族稀有氣體。再舉一個例來說：德國有機化學家泰斗Liebig有一次有個工廠派人拿了一種紅色的液體來求他分析，他並沒有細心的考察，便斷定這種液體是氯與碘的混合物。後來法國Balrad發明了　素·這個新元素同Liebig所存的紅色液體是一個東西，他才大大的失悔，以前不該這樣粗心，自己欺了自己。這些事實都可以證明學化學的人，應當養成精確習慣。</p>
<p>第三我們應有堅决的精神。化學的內容頭緒紛繁，範圍也非常廣大，不是一種容易學習的科學。允其在初學的時候，看見許多公式，定理，定義，常常感覺得繁難，但是如果能够拿堅决勇往的精神去應付，那未才不致一遇困難就灰心喪氣，以致終身沒有成就。從前德國著名化學家Baeyer對於藍靛的構造，曾費了上　年的心血，方才研究成功。像道種堅决的精神，是非常可佩的，並且値得我們效法的。</p>
<p>第四我們應有獨立的習慣。對於化學要想學好，全靠學生自己，無論從敎師或許是書本上得來的知識，非用自己的心思，去詳細考慮過，就不能有深切的了解，所得的也不能算是自己的學問。從講堂上或許書本中得米的知識，雖則可以說是美味佳餚，但是不經過我們自己的消化，那末對於自身也沒有益處。至於做化學實騐更非有獨立的習慣不可。一切的實騐，須用自己的手去做，自然不用說，就是實騐所產生的各種現象，都要自己去細心觀察，用自己的語言筆記下來，才有眞正的進步。所以獨立的習慣，也是應當培養的。有一部份舉生做實騐的時候，喜歡抄襲人家的結果，這是一種最壞的習慣，應常改革的。</p>
<p>化學敎育歷來的缺點雖多，但是最近都有了實際改進的辦法，因此化學敎育可以說是已達到了一個新的階段。前面所說的改進方法，不過是敎育當局一種提綱挈領的辦法，一方面我們要靠全國的中學敎員，以及敎科書的編輯人的合作，一方面我們還要全國的中學學生對於化學本着探求眞理的精神向前努力，然後中學的化學敎育，才有眞正發展的希望。（完）</p>

<p>— 荘學本</p>
<p>（三）羣科灘蒙旂</p>
<p>黑帳中一夜</p>
<p>又越過一層山坡、就到達了目的地——羣科灘、山溝中駐紮了十幾個帳芳心、內中夾著二個白色圓形的蒙古包、　　落落彼　此的隔離都很遠、　導者引著我們在一所靠近蒙古包的黑帳房前面下馬、此地距離白楊峽四十裏、所壓表的指針停留在三二六〇公尺、</p>
<p>帳幕中出來一個戴尖頂帽女子、把大毛狗擱住一位老者拉起了幕簾讓我們進去、我在爐灶的左邊一個栽絨的花墊子上坐下、老者也賠產豐進來、他就是此地的王爺爾力克貝勒—林沁呼救吒濟勒、—他儉樸的裝束、（穿一件普通的老羊皮襖）幾乎使我們誤認為一個普通的百姓、</p>
<p>我們今晚决定就住在這裏、烏拉（差馬）也打發他們回去了、午後的大風早已在棉花糖幕項上吼叫、支持帳幕的木桿時被吹落地、</p>
<p>這時我們受著王爺的招待、跌坐在灶下喝飲香而鹹的奶茶、前面的木盒中陳列著一格酥油（牛乳酷油）一格曲拉（奶渣）一格糌粑（炒麵）另外一盤剛在熱氣騰騰的鍋子中、取出的血水牛肉、（半熟而尙流血水的大塊牛肉）自由的給我們享用、</p>
<p>飲茶以後、我們親談些關於蒙人的生活·歷史·宗教·等一切、但是他們的漢語不很流利、而我們又誰都不懂蒙語、所以雙方在不能達意的時候、由警察用茶語來代替、</p>
<p>王爺又在他前面的蒙古包中取出一雙留聲機、現在他們雖有機器而都不會打開來唱、因為他的兒子已經上西寗去了、我們動手絞上彈簧、打開唱了幾張片子、他們也煩膩了這類的消遣、</p>
<p>傍晚的時候、風勢稍殺了一些、東山上的牦牛、西山上的綿羊、被牧童趕著回來、他們都忙碌了一陳、把羊子圍著、把牦牛絟著、然後纔預備他們的晚餐、今天因為有客人、所以由他一個才智的新媳婦發親自動手、扯了一個漢人常吃的麵片子、用血水牛肉湯煮成腥鹹的湯麵、</p>
<p>晚上我們就在坐處展開了帆布的行軍床、他們都還沒有見過、視著床底下驚奇、黑夜中灶裏的牛羊　吐着光亮的火花、照耀着帳幕的四角、我們的洋燭反而搖曳著沒有光亮、</p>
<p>王爺的女眷和王爺、他們為避免生客而都睡到蒙古包中去、黑暗的帳中、只剩着我們的同警察三人、另外二個喇嘛、和一個伯伯）王爺的管家）我們　着火談了一回、就分賓主左右的睡着、</p>
<p>夜間的風更比白天吹得兇猛、毳幕中帳眼腫鑽進微微的細風、棉花糖頂的窗縫重又舊上的一片黑鏌、帳內溫度已降至零下十二度、灶中的火花也漸</p>
<p>漸的低　、狂吼的暴風將幕布吹得轟轟的跳動、似乎要掙脫了絆索飛去、我蒙着被睡去足部一夜沒有覺溫暖、夢中又不時被棉花糖外吼叫的風聲喚醒、這時更覺得黑暗的嚴厲而偉大、</p>
<p>明天黎明起身、帳外被雪蓋成一片白色、呼呼的大風迄未稍息、雪還在繼續的下着、</p>
<p>爾力克貝勒</p>
<p>主要爾力克貝勒他是統　着「綽羅斯部」南右翼頭旗的郡王、現在已經六十多歲、上唇留著二片八字鬚、鼻管在幼年時壞了、講話全是嗡嗡的鼻音、不然他也能講幾句漢語、</p>
<p>他是一位開通的老王爺、曾去過北京七次、二次還是在淸朝的時代去的、所以他雖然住在草山帳房裏而對於外間接情勢很熟悉、他的夫人也同樣的到過北京七次、所以現在是一位賢能的婦人、</p>
<p>民國初年、他曾受到黎元洪總統的二等勳章、民國二十年靑　的蒙旗組織略變、他遂被任為右翼正盟長、現在他有導揮靑海東部十二旗的權力、但是他本旗的百姓很少、在這一帶遊牧的祇有七十個帳房、連「白楊峽」「恰布恰」的、總計不過一百多家、他的駐牧地本來在海南「上郭密」的「恰布恰」、近來因為番人的移居、而使他牧地縮小、他在五十年以前因就移駐在此地軸哄。軸哄是「羣科王」的牧場、至今還是向羣科王借用的）</p>
<p>他的家庭、有台吉（王子）二個、現在寗蒙藏學校讀書、女兒一個、媳婦一個、夫人一個、伯伯（管家）一個、奴婢男婦二個、牛把勢（牧牛童子）一個、喇嘛一個、</p>
<p>他的財產、有羊子六百只、牛二百頭、馬六十匹、蒙古包二所、黑帳房一個、札藏寺還有他的衙門一所、</p>
<p>蒙人的裝束</p>
<p>在初到靑海的人、對於蒙番兩族人的裝束迷離莫辨、時常會誤指蒙人、果然這因為他們的服裝的分別很少、但是你留意了也能發覺他們身上有若干顯著的不同、至於他們服裝相彷的理由、擄傳說近來靑海的番族勢力強盛、蒙族勢力漸次式微、幫服式遂染番化、甚至語言文字也多有傾向番人的趨勢、</p>
<p>此間女子的裝束、常穿的為團領老羊皮襖、無面、邊緣裩二寸寬的紅邊、裾長及地、富者用紫藍黑色的緞子或布掛面、腰間束一條紅帶、身的左方掛一根四寸長的奶鈎、（擠牛奶用的銅鈎、和一塊雞心形的銀牌、上面多刻花嵌寶石、帽子分兩種形式、一為皮耳帽、帽的左右两片護耳在冷天能折下、帽頂有大紅結子一枚、並訂綫鬚頭一綹、另一種為尖頂羔皮帽、上頂為黑色烏絨其圓邊作紅色、下面縫一轉白色的小羔皮、戴在頭上很像一個火鍋的形式、帽子的烏絨尖頂上（半裝着一綹很別緻的鮮紅鬚頭、這就是和番人裝束不同的一點、她們的頭髮從頂心起分左右為兩股、自耳際下垂至胸前、用一根二寸寬三尺長的鄉花辮套套着、束在腰帶中間、而辮套仍下飄及地、牠們這種髪飾和番女的辮　拖在北後的不同得很明顯、但是許多還未及笄的幼女、往往也梳小辮而分披背後、她們下身也許為利於大小便起見、習慣都不穿褲子、雙足赤着穿一種牛皮的硬底靴、</p>
<p>男子的外衣為老羊皮襖、穿褲、着硬底靴、帽子能行尖頂帽、貴屬戴狐皮帽、男子皮襖多提至膝下、便於騎乘、多數的蒙人頭頂還留長髮一方梳成一根半尺長的細辮、盤曲帽中、</p>
<p>蒙人的生活</p>
<p>這裏蒙人的生活還是滯留在遊牧社會居無定處、逐水草而　移、女子的工作往往比男子為勤苦、男女除了對外的交際、或從軍戰爭以外、他們就留在棉花糖裏閑逸、婦女們早晚須　奶子·熬茶·煮肉·空下的時間料理家務、</p>
<p>他們的飲食以牛羊肉·酥油、糌粑·曲拉·茶·為主食料、每日飲食通常三次、而飲多於食、每食必飲磚茶所熬之濃汁數碗、茶中和鮮牛奶數勺、　酥油·糌粑·曲拉·各一撮、茶飲畢、乃取糌粑一碗和茶及酥油、控成拳頭大小的麵檲、即為正式的飯食、他們吃的牛羊肉數時不時也很多、但是肉都煮成半熟的血水肉、外人以為不可響邇、而他們非此不算味美、</p>
<p>由此以上他們的居室非黑帳房即蒙古包、因為拆卸容易、遷移方便、而這一帶黑帳房比蒙古包為多、這也是深染番化的關係、蒙古包用羊毛毡子蓋成、裏面用森條做骨幹、圍成一所圓椎形的幕屋、通常直徑有一丈、門口掛一塊毛毡作幕帘、冬天內部很溫暖、黑帳房用牦牛長毛織的毳　制成、牦牛的毛不滲水、所以雖在淋漓的大雨中、也不會漏水、黑棉花糖房為四方形、中間用二根木桿頂着一條棍子作為大梁、四面用四根柱子把他撐起、外面再用十幾根毛繩把牠絟緊、帳幕的喑用泥土砌成長形的爐糟、日夜不熄的在煨燒牛羊糞乾、賬頂的中間開著一條長隙作為爐灶的烟囱、上面縫着一塊複帘、在落雪下雨的時候可以遮蓋、帳幕的四週、堆着一轉木箱皮袋、作為附壁、防止風雨的進襲、</p>
<p>他們的坐位以爐灶為區分、男左女右、鮮有紊亂、如果一個新來的男客人、誤踏進右邊的女主人坐位、很會引起他們的笑話、他們晚上睡覺的床位也是同樣的男左女右、雖然是夫婦表面上也應當這樣分開、他們睡覺多和衣而睡、叉腰作被、晚上不用燈亮、借着灶中的火光就能燭照全幕、他們起身和睡覺都很早、大有日出而起、日入而息、原始人生活狀態、</p>
<p>蒙人的經濟</p>
<p>擊科灘的蒙人、沒有一個帳幕中馴有一頭駱駝的、因為此地的牧場是一片草原、不適於駱駝的生存、擄說去年班禪有二百只駱駝放在此地、不上幾個月已死去了大半、靑海蒙人養駱駝的都在海西「鹽池」和「紫達木」一帶、那裏有戈壁（沙漠）所以適宜於沙漠之舟駱駝的生存、</p>
<p>但是他們的養的牛羊很多、少數財富的人家羊子以千計、牛以數百計、馬以百計、普通能自牧自給的帳戶、也都有一百個羊子、幾十條牛、</p>
<p>遊牧的人民、對於地方政府也免不了納稅的義務、靑海省特定於遊牧人的捐稅、軸哄有七十個帳房、他們每年分擔着草頭稅一千元、中間有一半是貧民、負擔不起重稅、所以每年祇有三四十個帳房分攤、</p>
<p>當地物價、羊三元、牛二十元、馬一百元、羊毛每担十元、白羔皮每張一元、黑羔皮每張二元、磚茶每包四元、麥子每担五百斤二十元、靑稞每担九百斤十二元、</p>
<p>多數的人經濟狀況很窮困、往往他們必需的日用品用賒帳的方法拖來、如四元一包的磚茶、提高作五元計算、到了明年、商人就到來收取羔皮羊乞求作抵價、至於他們的買賣方式、也多以物易物、</p>
<p>他們雖然經濟很拮据、而男子們始終快樂安親坐在帳房裏、不想去治生產、所以借債的利息已高到五分、</p>

<p>— 民生小學學生永譽</p>
<p>航空救國，喊得震天價響，成績雖然不差，可是還不能十分滿意。諸位小朋友們，近來你們大槪看見報紙上登着的購機祝壽吧？蔣院長本年五十壽辰，全國人民，有購機祝壽的豪舉，這件事情，對於國防上很有關係。古人說國家興亡，匹夫有責，吾們年紀雖小，都是中華民國的一份子。應該大家起來，節省糖果餅餌之費，共襄盛舉。通都大邑，有不少兄童，每月糖果所費，何止一元，我以爲全國兒童，只須每人每月捐糖果費二分，想來也不算一回事。然而聚沙成塔，集腋成裘，姑以全國有五萬千兄童計，每人每月捐資兩分，每月可得百萬元，即可購機十架，一年可得百餘架。在諸位每月節省糖果費二分，無損毫髮，然而衆擎易舉，國家已經獲益匪淺，諸位小朋友，大家一齊起來實行罷！</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>最近我讀到一本美國某小學的出版物，裏面有一篇是關於該校小學生的自治生活的記載。美國是一個民主政治，十分發達的國家，人民都是富有自治能力的。共實在美國，不只成人們，富有自治力，從這一篇記載中，我們已可見到美國的兒童，也是富有自治能力的。不錯，有了能自治的兒童，然後才能有善於自治的成人。我覺得關於這記載中的叙述，頗有介紹給我國小朋友的價値，所以特摘譯數則於後。</p>
<p>讀書會——該校的圖書館，是完全由學生管理的。在這圖書館的系統之下，有三個讀書會，分成甲乙丙三組。這三組，是依程度的高下而分成的。他們的讀書成績的表現，是每隔二星期或三星期，集會一次。在集會時，讀書而有心得的，得登台而作十分鐘的報告，由預行推定的評判員（不同組的同學）十一人，各別的判給分數。學期終了時結算，得分最多的，名列第一。還有一個方法，是作筆記。也待學期終了時，由公推的評判員，評定甲乙。每組中的甲乙二名的名姓，得列入該圖書館所特備的一本永久保藏着的「模範讀者題名錄」大簿中。</p>
<p>體育會——該會也是完全由學生自動組織的。在這體育會的系統之下，有旅行隊，球隊，柔軟操隊，健康及整潔糾察隊等。關於這些小組織，尙須有補充的說明。旅行隊，是以採集棵本爲目的的，每學期的舉行三次，都在周尾舉行的。球隊是以足球爲主的，每級組織二隊。由二隊中抽出一隊來，組成級隊，作級際賽。每一個周尾，至少有二隊此賽。健康，是以體育的增進，胸圍的擴大，爲標準的。每月檢查一次。</p>
<p>服務會——這是童子軍的組織。但他們服務的範圍，是非常廣大的。除了軍團中的普通服務外，對於同學們的行動，還負着監視之章。若是見某一同學在作不道德之事，而不加規勸，或不舉發的，一經敗露，得受嚴厲的懲處。但成績優良，或有特殊功績的，也得題名在一冊永被保存的「模範童軍題名簿」。</p>
<p>上述的三項，我覺得我國的小朋友們，也該自動起來組織，自動地起來自治，訓練成爲未來的好公民。</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在星期日的那一天，敏兒的父親從市上買了一隻熱水瓶回來。敏兒看見這隻瓶上寫着「保熱二十四小時，保冷四十八小時。」他看見了這「保熱二十四小時」七個字，便很詫異起來，就開口問道：</p>
<p>「爸爸，這隻熱水瓶怎能保熱二十四小時。」「它裏面是什麼東西做成的？可拆開來給我看看。」</p>
<p>他的父親便把那隻瓶拆開來，就看見一隻雪白的小瓶，一面便說道：</p>
<p>「敏兒，你瞧，這小瓶便是雙層的玻璃瓶做成，瓶壁上是鍍的銀質。因那瓶是雙層的，所以把在雙層間的空氣完全抽去，使它裏面眞空。爲什麼要眞空？我停一會兒講給你聽。」於是他父親脫去了帽子，喝了一口茶又說道：「至於它怎能保熱？倒也有些小根源，讓我從頭講起，使你更明瞭一些：講到熱，熱的傳遞有三種方法：　傳導：假如你拿了一根鐵桿，鐵桿的一端放在火裏燒，不一會而你手拿的一端，就覺得熱了。這呌熱的傳導。　對流：液體和氣體，受到了熱便上昇，冷的部分便下降，這樣的一上一下，呌做熱的對流。　輻射：有了上面二種方法後，如果沒有第三種，便要很大的問題。如果你看見電燈泡在亮的時候，我們俏使去摸一摸　燈泡上，就覺得很熱。這是什麼激理？我們知道燈泡裹萬是具空的，沒有對流的作用。又不和燈絲相接連，便沒有傳導的作用，這就是熱的第三種傳遞方法。</p>
<p>「至於熱水瓶怎能保熱二十四小時？因爲它是避免這熟傳遞的三種方法：　這熱水瓶裏的小瓶是獨在中央，不和什麼東西相接　，可以沒有傳導作用。　它是雙層壁，且壁問的空氣抽去，可杜絕熱的對流作用。　它壁上鍍的是銀質，輻射熱接觸了，便被它反射折回。所以有這三種方法，瓶中裝了熱水，或冰水，可以保持原有的冷熱。」</p>
<p>「爸爸，那麼它底下的尖頭，有什麼用呢？」</p>
<p>「因爲要把壁間的空氣抽去，抽去了空氣，就在這兒塞住的。」</p>

<p>— 子系</p>
<p>我們跑在路上只要稍稍留心一點的話，那儘可見到一根根電錢上躱着儘多儘多的鳥兒，在吱吱喳喳的鳴唱自若。奇怪，人摸着電錢就要觸電，怎麼鳥躱在電錢上倒不會觸電呢？我們要明白這個道理，該先知道怎樣才會觸電的道理？我們不論從電燈，電爐等有關電的東西上去觀察，後邊總是有兩根電錢相接。換句話說：凡是有電的作用，必須有兩根電綫，同時，電原有陽電和陰電或正電與副電的分別，有電的作用時，必須把這兩種爾都接通。只有陽電也不行，只有陰電也不行。觸電也不過是電的作用的一種，自然也須要兩種電。鳥停在電綫上所以不觸電，就是因爲它只停在一根綫上的關係，要是碰到了二根電錢，自然也雖保它會不發生危險，但是，反轉來講：我們人爲什麼摸着一根電綫有時也會觸電呢？原因很簡單：因爲人一手固然只摸着一根電錢，但是二足踏在地上，地上却另有一根使人看不見的電錢，這樣有了二根電錢自然要觸電啦。不過，我們奢穿一雙橡皮鞋就可免除這種危險。</p>

<p>— 子定</p>
<p>這是一伴極好玩的玩具，你可以用一張硬紙片把它做來玩弄。</p>
<p>第一你把下面這個甲圖—一個人騎着一匹馬的簡圖，畫在紙上。你看那圖上馬兒雖然只有兩條腿，騎者只止有一個臂膀，但是還有活動的馬腿和人臂要加上去呢。你且把甲圖着了顏色，黏在硬紙片上，把它剪了出來。第二再照乙圖—就是加上去的兩條馬腿和一個執鞭的人臂畫出來，也把它着了顏色，黏在硬紙上，把它們剪出來。</p>
<p>第三把剪下的甲圖，反面放在桌上，將加上去的馬腿排放適當的位置，要做成快跑的姿勢的。同時也把騎者執鞭的臂安放好。做到這裏，却必需要一個推動的桿子了。這桿子是很要緊的，必須用了它，才好呌人馬活動。做這桿子的材料？可用一條硬紙片，但最好用「塊薄的木片，比較耐久些。等到那排好的馬腿和人臂鑽了孔，用綫聯結好，就在馬腿緊結的上面再鑽兩個小孔，將這桿子橫放上去，對準這兩個小孔；在這桿子上也鑽兩小孔，用綫聯結，最後在桿子中心做一個隙口，以便容受那個馬鞭，那個玩具至此可算成功了，如丙圖。</p>
<p>將丙圖翻轉身來，就是丁圖。玩時，你只消把這玩具上的桿子前後推動，便可以看見那匹馬跑得十分迅速，而且那騎者的手臂也動得很活潑，眞像一個活人。小朋友們，這玩意很不差，在課餘時侯，不妨做來試試。</p>

<p>昨天敏兒同他的爸爸一同去看馬戲；閉慕以後，敏兒問他的爸爸道：「爸爸，這些做馬戲的老虎，獅子，象，等每天吃些什麼」？爸爸聽了敏兄的問，想了一想，答道：「我自己也不十分明瞭，我們去問問吧。」他們就一同走到一個馬戲團裏職員的面前，很客氣地問道：「先生，你願意吿訴我們這些野獸吃些什麼東西麼？」那職員聽了也很客氣地回答說：「極願意，極願意，假使你們不嫌煩瑣的話，讓我來慢慢地吿訴你們，普通一隻中年的獅子每天須要吃三十斤到四十斤牛肉，老虎也差不多，象是量貪嘴，它一天要吃五十五斤喬麥，和糠，山芋，蘿蔔，香蕉等。並且象還極喜歡喝酒，它能喝四五十瓶啤酒不醉，在天冷的時候，每隻象爲禦寒的緣故，要喝一瓶威十克（酒名性子極烈）你想厲害不厲害？還有大大小小的猴子，每天也要吃一頓餐和兩頓茶，茶裏是加了許多牛奶和糖，餐是由果子和蔬菜做成的。平均我們每天總要耗費三百塊錢，供給它們的食料。」</p>

<p>— 小蝦</p>
<p>鯨是一種哺乳動物，身體龐大，長六七丈，因爲它是棲息在水裏面的緣故，所以大家都呌它爲「鯨魚」，因稱爲「鯨魚」，所以有一般人以爲它一定也是魚類，和普通的魚一樣；其實不然，鯨是鯨而魚是魚。</p>
<p>鯨的身體比魚要大千萬倍；魚的體面披鱗片而鯨的體面　出一無所有；鯨的血液是溫熱的，而魚是冷血；鯨是胎生而魚是卵生；鯨用肺呼吸，魚用鰓呼吸，最顯著的除了鯨的身體極龐大之外，就要講到它們的兩種尾巴了，普通畫起鯨來，大多把它的尾巴畫得跟魚類一樣，這種錯誤很大。</p>
<p>爲什麼昵，鯨的尾形是平扁的，而魚的尾形却是直扁的（見上圓），然而一般人往往抱着錯的觀念，所以才有這種笑話弄出來！這兒我附着兩種的尾巴圖，以改正小朋友們以前所得到的錯誤。</p>

<p>我們的國家，現在是非常的　　，日受强　的　迫，不能復興，我們都是年輕的兒　，不要空　救國的口號，大家應該有一種堅决的志願：「到底我將來做怎樣的人來救國呢？」</p>
<p>我的志願是什慶？就是做一個有科學研究的醫生！現在我把我這志願的理由，寫在下面：</p>
<p>第一，因爲現在我國的醫生，總沒有科學研究的方法，來改良改良：更有一些毫無知識，讀了幾本醫學書，也來做醫生，莫明其妙的診治，因此許多人都受了他們的　；我家的姑姑和祖父，不都是吃錯了藥，死了的嗎？所以我將來必須要把中國的醫學，用科學研究的方法，來改良！</p>
<p>第二，因爲做醫生對于國家的益處，徐了能診治病人，而救活許多同胞的生命以外，如果向敵人開起戰來，我們做醫生的人，還可以上前綫去救護那些爲國奮屆的傷兵，這不是對于國家更有極大的帮助嗎？</p>
<p>第三，因爲現在的醫生，祗知賺錢，對于貧苦的人，毫不帮助！所以使許多貧苦的同胞，不能洽病，死去了！這眞是太不行了！所以我將來對于貧苦的同胞，絕對帮功，做一個救人的醫生。</p>
<p>我爲了改良中國醫學，救護前綫戰士，救濟貧苦的同胞，這三個原因：所以我的志願，决定做一個有科學研究的醫生！救中華民族—並且救全人類！</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>這種工作在柏穗希也是很困苦的。原來這好幾年間，小南洛漸漸地巳成了一個强壯的青年，而它却一年一年的衰老了。它的兩條腿已經僵硬，它的一身骨骼也常常作痛，然而它仍不肯懈怠了自己所應做的工作。小南洛很願意使它省點氣力，自己去拖那車兒，但是柏德希怎肯依他呢？它所能够接受的帮助，就是每逢陷進了冰凍的凹　時，由小南洛在背後推挽一下。可是柏德希一輩子慣了拉車的工作，它自己覺得很可驕傲的。它雖是挨着冰霜的欺逼，道路的顚簸，筋骨的酸痛，然而它是迸住了呼吸，低倒了　子，仍然不屈不撓的向前進行。</p>
<p>南洛曾屢次對他的愛狗說道：「柏德希，像在家裏休息休息　，像你這般的年紀，應該是休息的時候了。我自己也會拖這車子的。」但是柏德希雖很明白他的好意，却總不願意牢守起來，把它的身體放在兩個車柄的中間，在雪中一步步走去，這好幾年來，它的脚跡是當常印在那裏的。</p>
<p>柏德希心中想道：「除非是死了之後，誰也不應當休息的。然而它自己也覺得去休息的時候似乎也不遠了。它的眼光已不像從前那麼清明幷且睡了一夜之後爬起身來時，便覺腰痛，不過每聽得禮拜寺中的鐘聲打了五下，它知道天已破曉，工作就該開始，它再也不肯躺在草堆裏了。</p>
<p>老　士往往伸出他那枯瘦的手來，撫摸着柏德希的頭道：「可憐的柏德希，你和我不久就得靜靜的　在一塊兒了。」那時老人的心和老狗的心懷着同一的思想而同樣的悲哀，想他們倆去世以後，那一個來照顧他們所愛的小南洛呢？</p>
<p>一天午後，他們從盎　爾踏雪回來，平原上全積着厚厚的雪，已結得堅固而允滑，像大理石一般。他們一路走去，忽然發見路上掉着一個美麗的小木偶，在玩着小鼓，身體的有六寸高，穿着紅色和余色的衣服，拾起來看時，竟一些兒也沒有損傷。這實在是一件很美麗的玩具，小南洛想去找尋它的主人，可是找尋不到，他暗暗想這東西倒很可以送給小愛洛，伊見了一定很歡喜的。</p>
<p>他走過磨坊時，早已入夜了。他知道那兒是小愛洛房間的小窗子。他想他們倆自　兒就在一起玩要的，倘把這小東西送給伊，未必有甚麼妨害吧。</p>
<p>在伊的房間下面，有一座小小的棚，他爬上那斜面的棚頂，輕輕地在窗格上敲了幾下，原來他見裏面正有燈光亮着。小愛洛開了窗，向外張望，現出一些兒吃驚的神情。</p>

<h3 id="c214">康德不可知論批判 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 靜寅</p>
<p>伊曼紐爾·康德是近代的大思想家之一。他的哲學思想，在某一點上說，與黑格爾和費爾巴赫同樣，是獨樹一幟的。如果從形式上看來，他的見解可說是與極端的觀念論和一般物質論的都不全同，他是一面承認物是客觀地存在着，一面却又站在先騐的觀念論立塲的。他曾說：「我們於經騐之前並無知識，所有我們的知識皆以經騐爲開端。」這裏所謂經騐，當然是指我們對客觀存在的事物的經騐而說的，康德旣以爲知識來自經騐，不是先天的，當然就是承認物之客觀的存在了。同時，他還以爲知識的分析是從感覺的問題出發；在他看來，所謂感覺，又是客觀存在的物觸發我們的心而給與影響的結果；換言之，卽是說感覺是由我們的感官，腦筋與客觀存在的物相接觸而發生的。這種看法，不僅表現了物是客觀存在的，而且表現了人的感覺，觀念，思想，乃是由客觀事物刺激其感官，腦筋而發生，並非離客觀事物而獨立存在的。單由這點看來，康德可說是一個物質論者。然而，在另一方面，康德又是緊抱着先騐的觀念論的。他在表明了上述的見解後，跟着就說：「雖則我們的知識皆以經騐爲開端，但非我們的知識皆自經騐而開端。因爲這是很可能的，我們的經騐，其本身卽由二種原素組織而成：其一自感官的印象中獲取得來，其二由我們的知識機能，當其接受外物印象時，內發地加於外物的印象之上，故爲屬心的部份。所以這不是一個輕易的問題，不能輕信解答，必須經過端詳的考慮，方能有些把握。究竟有無一種知識，非獨脫離經騐，抑且脫離一切威官的印象，獨立自存呢？像這一種知識可稱爲先騐的知識，以別於經騐的知識——一種淵源於後騐或經騐之中的知識。」這樣，他便馬上陷入觀念論的泥坑中去了。</p>
<p>在這樣的矛盾中，在由物質論退到觀念論中，康德更成爲了有名的不可知論者。他表示着：我們不能不承認物是有的，但是，物究竟是怎樣的呢？物究竟是什麼呢？這是我們絕對不能知道的。物是有的，可是關於物的本性，物自身，我們是不能完全知道的。我們所能知道者，並不是物自身，而是對於我們所表現的現象，是在我們所可見到的界限內的物。這樣的不可知論便是康穗哲學的中心。</p>
<p>康德自己曾說他的哲學在先騐上是觀念論，在經驗上是實在論。因此，關於思想，知識的發生和構成的問題，他是站在實在論的立塲，卽是承認物之客觀的存在；可是關於知識究竟有怎樣普遍地通用的權利這問題，他却又是站在觀念論的立塲，認爲物自身的性質是不可知的。</p>
<p>然而，實在論的立塲和觀念論的立塲是不相容的。假使物是離開我們的心而客觀存在的，又假使人的觀念是客觀存在的事物的反映，那就不能有超經騐超感官的知識；反之，如果思想，知識是先騐的，物是心的從屬，那便不能有客觀存在的物。自然，人的感覺，思想意識不僅是受動的，而且對客觀事物還有積極的能動的反作用，因爲人類的感官就是動的，不是死的靜物，在感受客觀事物時，它也能起能動的作用；但是人類這種主觀的能動作用，絕不是獨立的先騐的，而是在有客觀存在的事物之下發生的。所以，物與心，客觀和主觀，實在與觀念，其關係，並不是並立的。康德將兩者並立起來，結局是使他成爲了玄妙的不可知論者；最後說來，仍然是觀念論者。在哲學思想中，嚴格說來，只有物質論和觀念論的對立，不能有在這對立之外的中間的折衷的東西；康德哲學在其成就上，在其體系的外貌上，雖可說是獨樹一幟的，但最後說來，他仍然是玄妙的觀念論者；他與一般觀念論者不同的地方只是在於表現的形式上，乃至只是在於所用的名詞上。</p>
<p>再說，物旣然是客觀存在的，而且，人類旣能在一定的時空內反映客觀事物而成思想，知識，那爲什麼不能用此知識去認識那客觀事物呢？依康德看來，我們只能知道事物所表現的現象，不能知道其本體，所以物自身是不可知的。但是，所謂物的現象是其本體的表現，現象並不是與本體對立的另外的東西，假使人類的感覺，知識有能動的作用，那又爲什麼人不能綜合並透過事物所表現出來的現象認識，知道其本體呢？自然，人的知識要受時空的限制，只能在一定時空內認識，知道事物的一定本體，不能超時空地一下就認識出尙不可能知道的東西，但在一定時間空間內，我們確能透過事物在那時所表現出的現象以認識其本體的。康德的不可知論以爲事物根本就無認識，知道的可能，這乃是玄妙的觀念論的另一表現。</p>
<p>對於康德，因格爾士和烏里亞洛夫曾有極正確的批判。依他們看來，物自身，如康德所說的一樣，不能與現象絕對地隔離，物自身是作爲現象而表現出來的，「物自體卽是對於我們的物。」對於物自體的不可知論，不外是機械地隔離物自體和現象的形而上學的理論的錯誤歸結之一。——這便是很正確的論斷。</p>
<p>世界知識</p>
<h3 id="c215">世界各主要通信社現狀 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 夕雲</p>
<p>通信社可以說是報章雜誌的恊力機關。它的任務是在世界各處設立通信網，蒐集各種消息，用極迅速的方法傳遞給報章雜誌以及其他機關。因爲它有這樣的任務，所以它的宣傳作用非常之大，世界各國對於通信事業也非常注意。在時局緊張的時候，各國的通信活動允其重要，允其能發生積極作用。遠者不說，單是在最近的意阿戰爭中世界各主要通信社在阿京的活動情形及其作用，便可概見一斑。據調查，在戰爭開始時，世界各通信社在阿京的特派員就有八九十名之多，現在更是超過百名了。這些特派員幾乎是每分鐘都在工作，他們不斷地將戰爭的消息，特別是於自己國家有利的消息電傳倫敦，羅馬，巴黎，柏林，紐的，東京，等地，使意阿兩國的軍事行動在數小時之內即可映照在全世界人的眼前。在這中間，英國路透社的活動允其積極而且有效，它在阿京的通信員不斷將意軍的暴行，阿國人民的奮勇抗戰以及所有對英國有利的消息宜傳於世界，意國的斯堆佛尼通信社雖然努力與之競爭，但結果仍是路透社發出的消息遍傳世界各處。自意阿戰爭開始一直到現在，全世界輿諭之所以憎恨和斥責意大利，主要的原因當然是在於一般人都有同情弱小民族，反對帝國主義的侵略行爲的正義感，但路透社的新聞宜傳在這中間也有不可忽視的作用。</p>
<p>說到國際通信社的組織，幾乎是每一個國家都有。參加「國家通信機關聯盟」的國家，主要的就有英美法德等二十八國，就中的主要通信社也有二十八家。在這裏我們只能舉出幾個世界最有名的主要通信機關來，大槪的叙述一下。</p>
<p>英國路透通信社</p>
<p>這本來是十九世紀中葉德國人巴烏爾，尤柳斯，路透所創始的，後米因爲這個德國人轉籍英國，所以他所創始的路透社才爲英人所有。在最初的時候，路透社只用信鴿等來行商業通信；一八五一年移到倫敦時才利用電信來傳達新聞，在新聞通信界中確立了它的地位；隨後又隨着英國的海外發展，更在全世界遍設通信網，成爲了「世界通信聯盟」的中心，各國的通信社差不多都要以它爲媒介才能結合。</p>
<p>路透社是專門傳達國外通信的機關，在這點上與其他國家的代表通信社有所不同。英國另外有一個專門傳達國內新聞的通信社，名爲The　Press　Association，它與路透社結成密切的有機關係，兩者互相帮助，以完成國內外通信的任務。現在The　Press　Association</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>在全英國共有百三十餘分社，以長三千哩的私設電綫傳達國內新聞，並將路透社的國外新聞分傳到國內。路透社要供給英國新聞給與它締的的外國通信社，主要地便要靠英國這個專門國內通信機關的蒐集。</p>
<p>路透社與英國那個專門國內通信機關的關係，最初只不過是單純的相互提携，但後來這通信機關日益强大起來，使路透社不得不與它發生更密切的關係；一九二五年路透社更將其過半的利息提供給它，事實上已將統制權讓與它了。及至現在，路透社之名雖然還獨立存在着，但實際上早已融合在The　Press　Association中了</p>
<p>美國聯合通信社</p>
<p>普通略稱爲AP，中國報紙常寫爲「美聯社」。它由全美千二百八十五家新聞紙共同組成，是純粹蒐集和傳播新聞的機關，不以營利爲目的，它所需的經費也由參加這通信社的各新聞社分擔，以不集資產不求利潤爲原則。至於通信社的執行機關，則是由參加的各新聞社互選出的理事會。</p>
<p>美聯社可說是由美國千二百八十五家報館共同所辦的合作事業。一方面這些報館有經常無代價地供給通信社新聞的義務，另一方面通信社也常將它所蒐集的一切新聞分傳給這些報館。它們共有蜘蛛網似的長達二十二萬五千哩的專用電綫，這通信社平均每日所發出的新聞的十萬言。</p>
<p>這個通信社雖是美國許多報館所合辦的，雖有二三千家報館經常無代價地供給它的消息，但它每年的用費也在九百萬美圓以上；其規模之宏大實居世界第一。同時，在由許多報館共同合辦一點上，它也是在世界通信社中特有的。</p>
<p>法國哈瓦斯通信社</p>
<p>這可以說是法國最大的唯一的通信社。它除傳達新聞外，並兼營廣吿介紹業。說到歷史，哈瓦斯的創立實比路透社還早。現在，它除在法國獲得了獨佔的地位外，並在西班牙葡萄牙以及南美等地顯示出很大的力量。</p>
<p>哈瓦斯也是「世界通信聯盟」的中心之一。由於它的發展，路透社的地位也被削弱了。在目前的世界通信社中，哈瓦斯是和路透同樣被重視的。</p>
<p>德國華爾富電報通信社</p>
<p>在大戰前，東歐北歐和中歐可說都是華爾富所有的領域，可是戰後隨着德國勢力的衰落，它原有的地盤也喪失了。現在，它　是德國國內的最大通信機關。至於組織，華爾富也與哈瓦斯一樣，是股分公司。</p>
<p>意大利　堆佛尼通信社</p>
<p>這原來是加入法國哈瓦斯的</p>
<p>本所組織成的通信社，但現在巳成爲意國官辦的唯一的國際通信機關了。它目前的任務便是鼓吹黑衣宰相的侵略主義。在意阿戰爭爆發後，它史是在不斷宜傳「爲文明」的　軍的勝利，但在事實上，除慕素里尼統制下的報紙刋它的新聞外，似乎沒有人接受它的通信。這一則是因爲多數人不同情用毒瓦斯去毒殺弱小民族，一則也是由於這通信社的組織較小，力量較弱的緣故。</p>
<p>蘇聯塔斯通信社</p>
<p>塔斯是蘇聯電報通信社的略稱。本來十月革命以後的蘇聯的對外通信機關最初是羅斯塔（Rota）通信社，但在一九二六年後它即退出於國際的通信系統圈外，代之而起的便是塔斯社。</p>
<p>塔斯社雖也參加「世界通信聯盟」，但它在本質上却是和路透及哈瓦斯等不同的。如果路透及哈瓦斯等是英法帝國主義的政治的流音機，那塔斯便是蘇聯有力的新聞宜傳武器。它不僅傳達一般的消息，而且特別注意關於現今世界各種矛盾的新聞，將那些爲路透社等所不願傳達或歪曲傳達的新聞之眞實情形，經常地傳播於世界。</p>
<p>和路透社與英國的專門國內通信機關及各報館有密切關係一樣，塔斯社與蘇聯的各國內通信社也有很深切的關係。它們在新聞的　集和傳播上都是實行互相帮助的。不過，蘇聯的通信社都是國營的，塔斯社雖與國內各通信社有相互依受國內的通信機關的牽制，在這一點上，可以說也和路透社的情形不同。</p>
<p>日本新聞聯合社　本來日本的國際通信是路透社所佔有的。但自一九二四年這新聞聯合社創立後，路透社也就喪失了這個領域。這新聞聯合社是由東京大阪等地的八大新聞紙所合組；其組織原則類似美國聯合通信社。</p>
<p>在日本，與這新聞聯合社對立的還有電報通信社。不過，這兩者雖是日本的最大通信社，但它們的國際新聞的傳達依然要依　歐美的通信社。</p>
<p>最近日本爲了强化新聞宣傳，已發生了聯合和電通的合併問題。同時，在强化新聞統制上，日本最近已出現了以聯合爲母體的同盟通信社。</p>
<p>此外，如巴爾幹，伊比利安半島，中歐，北歐，以及波羅的　諸國，也有參加「世界通信聯盟」的大的通信社，但這里不能一一述說了。</p>
<p>大上海風光</p>
<h3 id="c216">美容醫院的內景 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 文錚</p>
<p>現在是誰都在提倡社交公開的時代，上海的靑年男女們尤其爲倡導的前鋒。因此，「健美」，「健美」的聲浪到處都在飛揚着。因此，美容醫院便在這一大家需要中產生了。</p>
<p>美容醫院裏的顧客不僅是大量的婦女們，差不多也有許多自以爲不美的男子們，很熱心地前往請敎。因爲美容醫院並不是僅僅代人化妝而已；它更能使滿面雀斑縐紋化爲乾凈白嫩，麻皮瘡疤弄得平坦無痕；並可儘量使你發揮肉體美，恢復你已失去的風情。</p>
<p>記者爲了明瞭美容情形起見，日前特往石氏美容醫院參觀。據調查所得，這美容院確是上海始創第一家，已經開設有五年之久了。牠設在女子銀行大樓，亦卽是南京路虹廟隔壁。我們可以看見許許多多花枝招展的婦女們一面在虹廟裹燒香拜佛，一面又到美容院去「就診」，藉科學之助，使她們靑春多福。</p>
<p>當記者走到那美容醫院會客室裹面，門邊掛號處職員大的以爲我是來美容的吧，要我去掛號，我向他聲明是特來參觀的，他於是向我要了一張名片走進辦事處去。我看見掛號處懸着一塊牌，上面寫着「診療時間：每日上午十時至十二時，下午二時至六時，星期日下午一時停診。」「診金掛號：一元六角，以後每次六角。」停了一會，從辦事處走出一位穿西裝的先生來，他自稱姓屠，管理營業事務，他問我有何見敎，我說是特來參觀。他便走進診室裏去吿訴石霜湖醫師。一會，石醫師出來了，他是一位三十多歲，蓄着短鬚戴眼鏡的福建人。官話說得不很好，但態度極誠懇，我特別留心看他自己的面部，果然皮膚滋潤，白凈淸爽，衣履也極其整潔。他領着我先麥觀診室，房間雖然不大，，但佈置却非常精雅。一座寫字檯橫在窗前，除了文具外，另外擺着數十隻小玻璃瓶和類似小酒盃的玻璃器，據說裏面都是應用藥品。靠窗有一個文書樞，據說都是供參考用的報章雜誌和石先生自己編著的特刋等。裏面燈光特別明亮，對面看人極其清楚，我推想這大槪是爲的便於診視容貌。診室之旁爲電療室，除備有太陽燈一具外，並有一長方形類如衣橱的電氣樞。據說這是「熱光綫」及「石英燈」照射器，可以照全身，電面，電療婦女乳房平扁等等。蓋電照可使人身血液迅速流通，內部細胞活躍，允其對於皮膚上縐紋斑點等，除用藥水去除外，電流也可帮助其診治。照電時並爲就診者備有特製的皮墊椅，彷彿像理髮店裏所用的坐椅。其旁則設有冷熱水管盥洗面盆，並羅列各種化妝品，如：美容露，杏仁蜜，美容雪（以上三種代替雪花膏用，但效用可除縐紋，防雀斑，縮小毛孔，打底不褪粉色），美身液（又名搽身美容露，可預防皮膚病並保皮膚白嫩），避日美容膏（防止太陽曬黑）口中香（去除口臭保護牙齒），甘油皂（無刺激性和鹼性，可保皮膚白嫩）脫毛藥（可脫鬚不損皮膚）等等，均爲石氏自製。記者一瓶瓶的拿起來看看，試試，問問效用。只覺芬香撲鼻，細膩潤滑，不同凡品，據說這類化妝品銷路都很好。</p>
<p>據石醫師，美容醫院的醫術的有以下幾種：</p>
<p>面部　去除雀斑，點痣，去除各色（黃，灰，黑，白，紅）斑點，而部粗黑變白嫩，頸部黑變白，皮膚白嫩注射，面部角化去除，去除面皰，粉刺，瘢痕，去除瘡疤，麻皮吸平，面瘤去除，面疔，面　等去除。</p>
<p>各項電療　電面，電身，乳房。</p>
<p>眼眉部　白內障（失明）手術，生眉毛，改造眉毛，單眼皮變雙，大小眼手術，小眼放大，目漏，眼簾內反及外反，斜視手術，　　。</p>
<p>鼻部　酒糟鼻，鼻油過多制止術，去紅鼻，隆鼻術，去鼻茸，鼻痔。</p>
<p>口曆部　兎唇（缺嘴）縫合，闊口縮小，牙齒潔白，口唇與皮膚粘連拆開。</p>
<p>耳部　裂耳縫合，耳瘤，耳與皮膚粘連拆開。</p>
<p>手足部　上肢皮膚粗黑變白嫩，油灰指甲，狐腋臭，脚指濕癢，雞眼、</p>
<p>化妝　淡妝，艷妝，特別化妝（電氣化妝）頭髮脫落防止術，生髮，禿頭生髪，改胖爲瘦，改痙爲胖，胸部乳房發達注射。</p>
<p>這其間，以麻子吸平術爲最麻煩。據說：如果皮膚好的麻子，而麻粒又係一顆顆彊界劃淸的，則施術極易，大的二十天可以變平；如果麻粒一塊塊分不淸，而皮膚又過於蹙緊者，則往往費時至五六個月之久。還有隆鼻術也頗麻煩，卽俗語說的塌鼻子，要使它變成高鼻樑。在以前的美容醫生，多半用硬蠟術，這是有點近於開玩笑，因爲用這種方法裝成的好像假鼻子，一不當心，會弄得再凹下去的。但目前用象牙架高術，可以挽救。又如瘡疤去除，在普通一般外科手術師，多用刀割再縫創口，但石醫師則發明一法，只須用自製藥水塗在瘡疤周圍，使該處皮膚變成如同橡皮一樣，再用小刀慢慢修去，卽自然平復不留痕跡。對於單眼皮變雙亦然，只須用自製之藥水畫一條錢，該處自能分開成爲雙眼皮。但吊眼皮過甚之人不能適用。石氏曾就學於東京，後在星加坡開設美容院。在上海最出名的手術爲根治雀斑，並發明根治雀斑水一種，極有效騐。記者參觀後，再回到會客室裏，見已有時裝婦女三四人等在那裏求診。我便和石醫師握手吿別，在一陣芳香空氣中走出院門。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3 id="c217">武器的史的發展 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 靑軍</p>
<p>人類是能使用和製造工具的動物，所謂武器常然也是人類用以進行生活鬭爭的工具之一。假使生產工具的進步便是人類進化的表現，那在武器的史的發展中也可以看出人類的進化過程來的。</p>
<p>武器可以說是在原始時代就有了的。但那時的武器都很幼稚粗笨，且僅用以對付野獸毒蛇，並不是人類用來互相殘殺的東西。人間戰爭的武器之出現，乃是在牧畜和農業社會形成，私有制度發生以後的事。因爲那時人類才有固定的生活地域，才有私人佔有的財產，因而也才會發生爭奪土地，財產和奴隸的戰爭。</p>
<p>最初的武器可說還是石製的；隨後才出現了靑銅的武器；至於鐵的武器之出現，則是在紀元前三千年的時候。首先使用鐵的武器的是埃及的步兵。他們有長達六呎的長槍，有在堅木上包着鐵皮的盾，在腰間還橫掛着一口腰刀。自然，在那時也有弓箭，也有各種專門的弓手。但那時最利害的武器乃是一種初期的戰車。這戰車有輕重之別：輕戰車行動較遠，多用於一般塲台；重戰車則可深人敵軍的中心，直衝敵人，給與致命的攻擊。</p>
<p>在埃及之後値得說的當然是希臘時代的武器。的在紀元前六世紀之際，希臘就有很整齊的常備軍隊，這差不多都是由步兵組成的。在這步兵中有重步兵和輕步兵之別：前者屬於上級，他們所用的武器是矛，短劍，盾和盔甲；後者則屬於下級，他們以刀和石弓爲武器，沒有護身的盾和盔甲等物。這時巳常利用馬來作戰了，但騎士們還不能用馬鐙，因爲馬鐙的出現是在紀兀後五百五十年的事。至於這時最出色的武器，乃是有二十餘呎長的長槍。所謂長槍隊，在作戰的時候是依靠可以護身的主要的大盾，持着二十餘呎長的長槍，站在陣前壓陣並行衝鋒的。在歷史上建立空前大武功的亞歷山大，便是積極發揮了這長槍的威力的。</p>
<p>接着希臘時代的是羅馬時代。這時代的典型的武器是一種雙刃的短刀。刀長二十吋，無論前刺短劈都很適宜；這種武器也不知道殺害了多少人。此外，鏢和槍也是羅馬時代的武士們所常用的。這些武士們頭戴鐵盔，身穿鎧甲，腰掛短刀，手執長槍或短槍，帶着隨時可以打出的鏢，眞是威風凜凜，看來都像是殺人不眨眼的。</p>
<p>可是，歷史上却出現了羅馬的最大敵人，那便是「右手執劍，左手執可蘭經」的謨罕默德敎徒。他們有中國式的靑龍刀，也有短槍·劍·鏢·弓箭等武器。但他們不怕死，在戰場上他們不戴頭盔，不用盾，直往前衝，這是羅馬人所不能抵禦的。</p>
<p>羅馬帝國滅亡之後，歐洲社會便走入了中世紀的黑暗時期，即是社會史上的所謂封建時代。這時代的封建領主們都養有許多武士爲自己效忠，由此便出現了中世紀的有名的騎士。</p>
<p>領主們爲要表現自己的威嚴，爲要買活臣下的心，不惜拚命剝削農民，把他們的騎士武裝得非常威武而且華麗；據歷史的事實，每一個騎士的武裝費至少要三十鎊。這樣的騎士們都騎着肥馬，掛着短劍，拿着長槍和雙刀，隨便在什麼地方都要充分地表示自己的英雄氣慨。</p>
<p>騎士之下的步兵所使用的武器，主要的是矛，短劍及盾三種。在步兵隊中有弓箭隊，他們所射出的箭能達七十至百五十碼之遠。這可說是當時最厲害的武器之一。</p>
<p>中世紀的最有名的戰爭不消說是十字軍的東征。在這戰爭中，騎兵的活動佔着很重要的地位。交戰者的歐洲騎兵隊和土耳其騎兵隊都佩帶刀槍弓箭，但因爲氣候的關係，土耳其騎兵是比較輕裝；同時他們所用的劍也與歐洲的略有不同，即他們的是彎形的，基督敎的歐洲所用的則是直劍。</p>
<p>由於迭次的十字軍的東征，由於不斷的戰爭，由於產業的發展，隨着中世紀黑暗時期的結東，武器也有了飛躍的進步。拿弓來說，約在十六世紀時，舊有的弓（Longbow）已漸次變成了弩（Crossbow）。這弩的威力是數倍於弓的，牠能射達二百五十碼以外而不失其效力。</p>
<p>但這時最大的事件乃是火藥的發明和砲火的出現。本來，火藥在紀元前一千年間中國已經有了，但歐洲人的利用火藥作槍砲却是在文藝復興期中開始的。在這里値得特別提出的，是一五四○年時有名維特利者發明了一種長不足二呎的短槍。這雖然沒有現在的手槍精良，厲害，但牠容易發火射擊，且便於携帶，在當時却可說是最新式的武器。至於大砲的出現，那是比這短槍的發明還要早些。在十四世紀時，德國軍隊即利用大砲打了勝戰。一四五三年君士坦丁之戰，謨罕默德二世更組織了砲兵隊，使用了大砲七十門；就中有三門其口徑是二十五吋，它能將一千五百磅的石頭投射到一英里之外。與之交戰的希臘軍隊便可說是敗於這大砲之下的。</p>
<p>這樣的大砲和短槍的出現在武器史上是値得大書特書的。因爲有了這些東西，特別是在這些東西的發展之下，舊有的刀劍戈矛等等在戰爭中便要</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>漸逐失去效用，舊有的武術也逐漸成爲了歷史的遺留品，因而戰爭中的戰略和戰術也必爲之一變。依據這點，我們可以說，十六世紀槍砲未出現以前的武器和戰爭是古代的，封建時代的，這以後的武器和戰爭則是近代式的。</p>
<p>在近代的歷史上，也有許多大的戰爭；在這些戰爭中更出現了許多新奇的武器。現在我們且把其中幾個主要時代的武器大略的考察一下。</p>
<p>首先是有名的拿破崙時代。在這時代中，拿破崙所用以擾亂全歐的步兵武器是步槍和刺刀。相傳在某個時候，拿破崙會發現了他的兵士遺棄刺刀的事，於是他即嚴重地向兵士們說：一刺刀是的兵士的最好武器，是最適合於法兵的武器。誰遺失了剌刀，必要嚴重處罰！」在拿破崙指揮意大利軍的時候，他曾廢除該軍所持的劍而以刺刀　代替它。這是因爲刺刀能和步槍同時使用，比較便利；在肉搏時它尤能顯示出大的威力。</p>
<p>拿破崙時代的軍隊，當然步騎砲丁輜都是齊全的。在這中間，除工兵和輜重兵有特殊的任務外，騎兵作戰的武器是和步兵的差不多，砲兵所用的大砲主要的是六，八，十二磅砲，雖然也有十六磅的，但數量却很少。</p>
<p>其次是普法戰爭時代的武器。差不多目前所使用的最厲書的許多武器在那時都已經有了。如那時法兵所用的來福槍，其有效射擊可達一千三百碼。這與拿破崙時代的步槍比較起來，當然嬰厲害得多了。至於砲兵所用的大砲，法國所用的雖較德國的爲大，但因法國的是從砲口裝入砲彈，穗國的則是從砲尾裝入砲彈，所以實際上後者的威力是超過前者的。</p>
<p>在普法戰爭中，德國的大砲曾顯示了最大的威力。它的砲陣是：一，十五　鋼鐵來福砲；二，十二　靑銅來福砲；三，九　鋼鐵來福砲；四，十五　靑銅來福開火砲：五，二十一糎靑銅來福田鷄砲。就在這樣的砲陣威力之下，法軍是被戰敗了。</p>
<p>最後當然是在一九一四年爆發的世界大戰中所出現的武器，那便是盡人皆知的飛機，唐克車，毒瓦斯等等。至於未來大戰的武器，當然更要厲害，道是我們快要見到的。不過，武器發展到現在可說是巳達到頂點了，它的前途呢？我們敢大膽地說一句：它是會隨人類相互國爭之永久消滅而永久消滅的。</p>

<p>— 朱永康</p>
<p>我在印刷局作工已經有十年了。我是十三歲時就到這裏來做學徒的，現在我已經升到「裝版」的工作了。在這整整十年的生活中，我一天只是同「字釘」做朋友。我們目所見的，手所弄的，心裏所注意的，都是「字釘」。整天在這陽光不大充足，空氣不甚流通的屋子裏，呼吸着「油墨」和油姻的氣味。早已戚到生活太枯燥，太厭煩了，很想另外換換口味，另謀職業；但是我已經似乎成了專門的排字工人了，在這失業恐慌的現在，也只得將就下去。</p>
<p>我十年前到這裏來時，人家都呌我「學生子」。學生子的工作便是「擇字」和「還字」。在未擇字和還字之先，要學習中國字的「部類」。「字彙」的認法完全是依照「康熙字典」。現在我當然非常熟習了。但在當時，我僅僅是一個高小學生的程度？中國字又那樣多，分類又是那樣複雜，我是用了兩月「試學」的工夫，才勉强記熟了的。但是中國字的「偏旁」「部首」有些又不能照一般規定。例如「分」字，你以爲在「八」部嗎？但實際上牠在「刀」部。如像「阝」（邑）部和「阝（阜）部，有時硬分不淸楚。所以兩月的試學以後，也只是大槪記得一些，至於詳細分類，那起碼是過了兩年才弄熟了的。「字釘」大概是斜放在一列一列的木架上面，同一部首的字放在同一欄，同一欄中，筆畫少的放在前面，筆畫多的放在後面，同字典上的字一樣排列。但是擇起字來就比翻字典困難得多了。你擇過這一個字以後，說不定又要跑好幾步路才尋得到第二個字。因爲入家「原稿子」上字的排列是沒有照字典的順序排列的。檢一個字跑一趟，檢十個字跑十趙，如果檢到一千字不休息，那你的頭就已經發暈了，何，况只有立着，跑着，决沒有讓你坐一刻鐘，的機會呢？我一直做了三年學生子，我一直就在「字釘房」裹繼續不斷地立了三年，跑了三年，腿不但酸，發麻，而且現黃腫。眼睛呢？新的字釘還易認識，俱是字釘有百分之九十是經過油墨的塗染，在陽光暗淡的屋子裹，你非用力地定睛地看，是不能分辨得出的。</p>
<p>擇得的字你便放在「字盤」上面，一排一排依着原稿的順决放，預備人家拏去「裝版」。到了版已製好，或者已經印過，或者已經打過「紙版」，這「字版」又要撤下，撤下的字又該我們做學生子的去還，這就呌做「還字」。還字同擇字，手續差不多一樣的麻煩。你從甚麼地方檢來的，你也得東奔西跑地還放原處，共字彙的順决也一點不能混亂，不然，第二决檢擇起來便更加麻煩了。</p>
<p>擇字和還字是我們徘字工入起碼的工作，但也是最苦的工作。手上全是漆黑的油墨，使你不能去擦臉摩鼻，不然便是一身的墨。衣服你是終年沒有穿過淸潔的。但是說到工錢也就可憐極了。大槪每天十小時工作可以得三角到四角大洋。一天所擇的字和所還的字至少是在四千以上。晚上回到家裏，通夜都感到脚腿酸痛，眼睛紅腫，到了第二天早上都還不能復原，但是仍然要拖着疲倦的身子去上工。</p>
<p>擇字和還字的學徒生活三年算是受滿了。伶俐的可以升爲「刻字」工，笨的仍然擇字，還字或「拆版」。表面上看來，「刻字」是比第一步工作舒服經省得多了，可以坐着不動，也可以講點淸潔；但是刻那五號字和六號字，前日又是用鉛來刻，不但你的眼睛經不起，就是你</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the reorganization of the Hai River Engineering Bureau, the municipal government sent section chief Chen Gongzhe to meet with the British Consul-General twice on the 8th and 9th, requesting that he expedite the transmission of our suggestions. The Consular Body decided at a meeting on the 9th to temporarily refrain from expressing its attitude and forwarded the original letter to the diplomatic corps for instructions. According to Xiao Tan, the authority over the Hai River is entirely in the hands of foreigners, and we have no say in the matter. If the management is effective, there would be no objection. However, the river channel is becoming increasingly silted, affecting the prosperity of Tianjin, so we cannot ignore it. The request for reorganization is a normal right. The Consular Body is inclined to accept the request and is unlikely to cause a major storm. If our opinions are not adopted, we will take effective coercive measures and will no longer tolerate the delegation of responsibility. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Relevant Parties Confer on Effective Measures to Suppress Smuggling <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Regulations Have Been Prepared and Submitted to the Ministry for Approval</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Chief Inspector of the General Customs Office of the Ministry of Finance dispatched White Lee Char, a British national and the head of the Anti-Smuggling Section, to Tianjin to investigate the smuggling situation in North China and assist the customs in planning appropriate measures. A meeting was held at the customs office at 10:00 AM on the 9th, attended by Xiao Xichao, a specialist from the Ministry of Finance, Lin Shize, the superintendent of Tianjin Customs, Xu Liya, the chief of Tianjin Customs, Spu, the head of the Anti-Smuggling Section, and Chen Gongzhe, the section chief of the municipal government. White Lee Char explained the intentions of the Chief Inspector of the General Customs Office. Xu Liya then reported on the smuggling situation and losses. Afterwards, they discussed effective anti-smuggling methods, considering several hypothetical situations and jointly discussing them. A concrete plan was decided upon and telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In general, the future anti-smuggling methods in North China will involve customs patrol boats only patrolling the sea, and armed anti-smuggling will be carried out. It is hoped that the railway will provide practical assistance to prevent land smuggling, and it is also hoped that the administrative organs in North China will thoroughly assist. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The measures for anti-smuggling in North China, as determined by the Ministry, have encountered obstacles in implementation. After discussions between Xiao and Lin, a mitigating method was proposed. The municipal government immediately dispatched a specialist to Nanjing to report to the Ministry of Finance and request approval. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The authorities, including the customs, the municipal government, and the Tianjin Customs Superintendent's Office, have agreed on the following regarding smuggled goods from eastern Hebei: if any party does not assist in the crackdown, the last resort will be to send additional customs officers to work at the Dongzong Railway Station and heavily tax goods coming from the east. According to customs information, the Tianjin Customs' losses in March due to smuggling of goods from eastern Hebei were approximately 5 million, and in April, the losses were approximately 3.5 million, not including the losses from re-export goods. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Xichao, a specialist previously dispatched by the Ministry of Finance to the north, visited Song Xiaolin Shize and others to discuss effective measures to suppress smuggling in North China. After discussions between Xiao Zhenying and others with relevant Japanese parties, it is said that the Japanese side agreed to assist to a certain extent, but hoped that our government would reduce the tax rate to fundamentally resolve the issue. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Smuggling by ronin from Guangzhou is becoming increasingly rampant, with forty to fifty cases of smuggled goods seized each month. The ronin have requested the Japanese consul to be responsible for negotiating their return. The central government plans to establish a national anti-smuggling headquarters, with a branch in Guangdong. Kong Xiangxi telegraphed Guangdong to seek agreement and will send Tang Haian to Guangdong in mid-month to discuss the matter. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) White Lee Char, the anti-smuggling tax inspector of the National General Taxation Department, arrived in Tianjin a few days ago to conduct a detailed investigation of the smuggling situation in North China.

Detailed regulations have been formulated and will be implemented after being submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Waiting for Orders From Tokyo; the Future Does Not Seem to Bring Further Complications</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In the negotiations with the East, one side's position is not to exchange conditions to cancel anything. After efforts by the authorities to mediate, the negotiations have entered the right track. Staff Officer Yongjian Lin invited Xiao Zhenying to a meeting on the 9th. Due to being busy, it was decided to discuss the matter on the afternoon of the 10th. The Japanese side's opinions on abolishing the puppet government of Eastern Hebei are now consistent, and the negotiations should not have any further complications. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar problem being discussed here still takes the abolition of the puppet organization in eastern Hebei as a prerequisite. It is said that the Japanese side in Tianjin is in complete agreement on this matter and is currently waiting for orders from Tokyo. Therefore, the timing of the resolution still needs to be awaited. After Tada returns to the country, our side will continue to negotiate with the new incumbent Tadai. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Two hundred artillerymen from the Guadaibu heavy artillery regiment of the Japanese 5th Division arrived at Tanggu early in the morning on the 9th aboard the Hokurei Maru. They changed trains at noon to come to Tianjin and will be stationed in Kaiping and Tongzhen on the 11th.

<p>(Tianjin) The impediment to the Eastern Hebei diplomacy lies within, not without. A group of frustrated warlords and politicians are playing tricks and obstructing the negotiations, and the puppet organization of Eastern Hebei is spreading rumors and inciting the people. The authorities are negotiating based on fixed principles, unyielding and persevering. It is expected that a concrete result can be obtained before and after the replacement of Tada with the new military commander Tadai. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng hosted a banquet for Ishii, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, and Ota, the director of the Tianjin office, at the Beining Railway Bureau's reception office at 7:00 PM on the 9th to continue discussing the construction of the Cangshi Railway.

<p>Revenue and Expenditure are Balanced, Implementing the Government's Proposal</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The national general budget for the 25th year, compiled by the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics, was submitted to the National Government on the 9th and will be forwarded to the Central Political Committee for approval. It is reported that the revenue is divided into sixteen categories, with customs duties, salt taxes, and unified taxes as the mainstay. The expenditure is divided into seventeen categories, and the allocation ratio of various expenses is generally improved compared with previous years' budgets. The total amount of revenue and expenditure has increased slightly compared with last year's budget. The total amount of the 24th year budget was more than 957 million yuan, of which approximately 200 million yuan belonged to transfer revenue and expenditure and expenditure of self-owned property. The expenditure directly borne by the national treasury was still only more than 700 million yuan. The general budget for this year has been able to balance revenue and expenditure, which is sufficient to implement the government's proposal to complete the legal tender policy and balance the national treasury's revenue and expenditure. In addition, although this year's budget includes bond income of tens of millions of yuan according to public debt expenditures, it is entirely used for business expenses and has nothing to do with ordinary political expenses. This is because the national operating capital expenditure for this year is listed at more than 96 million yuan, and the construction expenditure is listed at more than 52 million yuan, while the educational and cultural expenses and the internal affairs expenses all contain a significant amount of new business expenses, which approximately offset the amount of bond income.

The principle has been approved by the provincial government meeting, and the detailed measures are being drafted. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Fujian Provincial Government previously consulted the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the surtaxes on farmland tax, slaughter tax, and regiment fees in various counties be temporarily retained, and that exemptions be granted separately once compensatory measures were devised. The Ministry of Finance has now replied to Fujian Province, stating that the slaughter tax collection regulations stipulate that the regular tax for each pig is 40 cents. The province's consultation stated that the county's slaughter tax is 1.2 yuan per pig, and the livestock business tax is 75 cents per pig. This seems excessively high. Although the temporary retention of the surtaxes on farmland tax, slaughter tax, and regiment fees in various counties is to maintain the original revenue, considering the people's financial capacity, it is indeed difficult to bear. Please order them to be strictly reduced as soon as possible, and devise compensatory measures as soon as possible to abolish them, in order to comply with the law. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">On the Opening of the Conference of High-Ranking Local Administrative Personnel <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The Conference of High-Ranking Local Administrative Personnel convened by the Executive Yuan is scheduled to open today at the Lizi Society in the capital. In addition to the department heads and commissioners of various provinces, the Military Affairs Commission, the Ministries of Interior, Education, Finance, and Military Affairs, and the National Health Administration have all sent representatives to participate. The chairmen of the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei have also been specially invited to Nanjing by the Executive Yuan for consultation. The authorities' concern for the people's suffering and their determination to reform can be seen here. At the conference hall, many talents are gathered, each contributing their insights to jointly plan ways to reduce harm and increase benefits. The points that should be discussed, as we know them, include: the issue of joint office of provincial governments, the division of powers of administrative commissioners, the benefits of reducing bureaus and merging sections in county governments, the custody of local financial revenue and expenditure, the establishment of districts in various provinces, and the situation of granaries in various provinces. All the proposals are based on facts and seek practical adjustments. It is expected that the conclusion of the discussion will fulfill our hopes. I would like to offer some humble suggestions on this day.</p>
<p>First, regarding the system, we believe that the authority of county magistrates should be increased. County magistrates are officials who are close to the people, and all actions affect the people's livelihood. They must be able to see the local advantages and disadvantages clearly. They are not like the provincial government, whose vision is broad and easily isolated. If the right person can be appointed, it is okay to give them more flexibility to avoid the labor of sending documents back and forth and to achieve decisive results. Administrative commissioners are between the provincial and county levels and are responsible for directly supervising county administration. It is really not convenient to interfere in everything and cause obstacles. However, they should also visit and inquire about the people's sufferings at any time so that the people can easily seek help and the county magistrate can avoid the suspicion of exceeding their authority. As for the title of "commissioner," it is slightly obscure. It should be clearly defined, and appropriate official titles should be given to emphasize the system. Since their powers are above those of the county magistrate, they should not be allowed to also hold the position of county magistrate to avoid the suspicion of being too heavily burdened.</p>
<p>Second, regarding finance, public funds should be saved as much as possible. Given the decline of the rural economy, the decline of local markets, and the exhaustion of the people's resources, it is difficult to increase taxes frequently. Since the government cannot increase revenue, it can only reduce expenditure to adapt to the situation. The joint office of provincial governments and the reduction of bureaus and merging of sections in county governments are all ways to reduce expenditure. We are pleased that the authorities are aware of this. It is hoped that all agencies can follow this idea, deeply understand and vigorously implement it, reduce redundancy, and seek compression, so that everyone in the position is a useful talent, and no public funds are wasted.</p>
<p>Continuous disasters have struck repeatedly, and there is almost no clean land in the country. The people's livelihood has reached its limit. Some sigh that they have lost their family property and cannot recover. Others are only concerned with survival after the famine. Even in so-called prosperous areas, they are stretched thin and feel extremely stretched. In such a bleak situation, we can only rely on the good offices of officials to comfort and care for them, to cultivate the declining vitality of society, and to seek the future livelihood of the people. All actions that are inconvenient to the people and are close to harassment should be exempted or corrected. Even if it is related to reform and innovation, it should not be abandoned, but rather a gradual approach should be adopted, and a tactful attitude should be adopted, avoiding rash action, which would cause resentment and make the effectiveness of the administration lose its credibility. This is what public officials should pay close attention to. It is hoped that this conference can have practical suggestions so that senior administrative personnel in various provinces can use them to admonish their subordinates and work together to seek well-being. What we expect from the conference is to be considerate of the people's livelihood.</p>

For our own duties, we should sincerely contribute our abilities on weekdays, and we must also have the determination to sacrifice in times of crisis. If the whole country can do this, then shame can be avenged. Ye finished his speech and the meeting was adjourned. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Japanese House of Representatives Discusses Relations with China and Russia <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Meizu announces annual purchase of more than 2 million yuan in military supplies; Minister of the Army and Navy says other details cannot be publicly announced.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives continued its general budget meeting at 9:10 AM on the 9th.  Sakurauchi Heigorō of the Minsei Party first asked questions.  The Prime Minister stated yesterday that Japan-Russia relations are generally expected to overcome difficulties.  However, when the Prime Minister was in the Saitō Cabinet, he stated that various matters between Japan and Russia would be resolved in due course.  Furthermore, during the Okada Cabinet, he asserted that there would be no war.  Why has the Prime Minister's determination changed so drastically?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota replied, "My belief has consistently remained unchanged.  However, the Soviet Union has gradually increased its military strength in the Far East, which differs from the previous situation.  Therefore, in Japan-Russia diplomacy, it is necessary to consider the Soviet military strength and resolve issues one by one.  Regarding this matter alone, there is no danger of war.  In this sense, it can be said that we are generally expected to overcome the difficulties."</p>
<p>Sakurauchi further inquired, "What are the peaceful means of adjusting Japan-Russia relations?"</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita replied, "Japan-Russia relations lack clarity.  As explained in my speech on diplomatic policy, the Soviet Union lacks understanding of Japan and harbors suspicion.  However, diplomacy requires appropriate handling in each situation."</p>
<p>Sakurauchi asked about the issue of unifying diplomatic authority.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied, "The Minister of Foreign Affairs is responsible for diplomacy.  Whether in the past or future, diplomatic issues should be unified under the Minister of Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p>Sakurauchi then raised questions about the redistribution of world resources and immigration issues with Foreign Minister Arita.  Afterwards, he mentioned the issue of adjusting the Army's northward advance policy and the Navy's southward advance policy.  Army Minister Terauchi replied, "Japan's national policy is to expect the development of the nation while maintaining peace in East Asia and contributing to world peace.  Within these limits, the Army and Navy share their missions, and there are no so-called northward or southward advance policies."</p>
<p>Sakurauchi then questioned the North China issue. Foreign Minister Arita expressed his determination towards China, stating, "North China is a place of close mutual interest between Japan and Manchukuo. Therefore, Japan has a significant interest in North China and seeks its development."</p>
<p>After Mr. Sakurai finished his questioning, Ōkuchi Kiriroku of the Seiyūkai rose to ask questions. "Future national expenditures are constantly expanding. Please clearly explain the source of these funds."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Baba replied, "In my opinion, there is no other way than to expand industry and trade and strive to strengthen finances."</p>
<p>Ōkuchi criticized the imbalance of central and local burdens and the relationship between military industry and tariff policy. He also stated, "The current cabinet has consistently issued empty statements."</p>
<p>Mr. Ōkuchi then questioned the military industry issue.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Nagano replied, "The amount paid by naval-related organizations to foreign countries in the 11th year of the Showa era (1936) was 22.2 million yuan, which accounts for 5% of the total expenses."</p>
<p>Army Vice Minister Meizu also replied, "The Army pays approximately 300,000 yuan annually for purchasing weapons from foreign countries. Purchases made through private merchants amount to about 2 million yuan."</p>
<p>Ōkuchi shifted the topic and strongly advocated for the industrialization of rural areas before considering the issue of tax increases.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Baba replied, "I will do my best to avoid implementing mass taxes such as medicine sales tax, stamp tax, and textile consumption tax."</p>
<p>Ōkuchi continued, "Establishing a future financial plan requires first deciding on the Army and Navy plans." He also suggested that this financial plan be published in the Diet.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Baba avoided the attack and said, "This matter requires further study."</p>
<p>At 11:50 AM, the speaker announced a recess. (9th, DOMEI News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives general budget meeting continued at 1:40 PM. Takehisa Kiyoshi of the Minsei Party raised questions about the issue of trampling on human rights, hoping that Ministers Lin and Chao would thoroughly investigate and handle the matter properly. Sunada Shigemasa of the Seiyūkai and Hata Akira of the neutral faction also pursued the government regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Uehara Etsujirō of the Seiyūkai mentioned the issue of lifting martial law and improving the parliamentary system, stating that it is necessary to establish a standing committee. He also stated that the practice of appointing ministers of the military department only after obtaining approval from within the military department is inappropriate. It is rumored that the government and the military department often have conflicting opinions on the same issue, which is regrettable. What is the reality?</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied, "Such public opinion may exist, but we will strive to avoid this situation in the future."</p>
<p>Mr. Uehara further questioned Foreign Minister Arita about the existence of the Investigation Bureau. Regarding Japan-Soviet relations, the Foreign Minister said that he should make them understand. What steps has Japan taken so far? The Foreign Minister replied, "Although it is not convenient to specify the specific methods, we must strive to remove their suspicion and distrust of the Soviet Union in the future." Mr. Uehara also said that establishing diplomatic policy is the biggest issue today, so he hopes that it will not be violated by anyone and will be implemented with a spirit of determination. Adjusting Sino-Japanese diplomacy is based on the perspective of trade and commerce to guide China. What should be done?</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied, "Although this matter requires considerable consideration, I feel it is not convenient to talk about it further. Please observe the implementation in the future."</p>
<p>Mr. Uehara also raised questions about the issue of anti-communism.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied, "Joint work between China, Japan, and Manchukuo is essential. Regarding the protection of trade, we should seek solutions with peaceful and rational means and firm determination."</p>
<p>After Mr. Hata asked Finance Minister Baba about rural finance and social policy, he asked the Minister of the Army to explain the national defense costs.</p>
<p>The Minister of the Army replied that he would explain it at an opportune moment during a closed session.</p>
<p>He asked the Minister of the Navy about increasing warship construction costs.</p>
<p>The Minister of the Navy also said that it was not convenient to speak about it outside of a closed session. (9th, DOMEI News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:07 AM today. After referring the Aviation Law Amendment Bill to the committee, it began questioning.</p>
<p>Katō Masayukinosuke was the first to take the podium, stating that Prime Minister Hirota's cabinet touted sweeping away accumulated evils, but appointing Mr. Hirao, who advocates abolishing Chinese characters, as Minister of Education is extremely contradictory. The doctrine of abolishing Chinese characters contradicts the purpose of Eastern cultural research institutions such as the Daito Bunka Gakuin Shibunkai. Also, should the Emperor's edicts be written in kana (Japanese alphabet)?</p>
<p>Minister of Education Hirao replied, "I am not an advocate of abolishing Chinese characters. Properly organizing Chinese characters can help local governments suffering from excessive educational expenses." The Minister of Education then explained the effectiveness of his years of research on abolishing Chinese characters.</p>
<p>Fuji demanded that the Minister of Education stop distributing pamphlets advocating the abolition of Chinese characters.</p>
<p>The Minister of Education replied that he would consider it.</p>
<p>Next, Matsui Shigeru took the podium and stated that Prime Minister Hirota stated that the subject of sovereignty is the Emperor, which is a matter of course. The government should study methods to popularize this matter among the general public from an educational standpoint.</p>
<p>Then, regarding national spirit, reviving the hamlet or five-family system, and finally, advocating for a unified military and civil, breaking up the zaibatsu (financial clique), and fair speech, the ministers all expressed their agreement. The meeting adjourned at 0:40 AM. (9th, DOMEI News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) After Japanese Foreign Minister Arita announced his diplomatic policy in the British House of Commons yesterday, The Times published an editorial criticizing it, titled "Japan on the Asian Continent." It briefly stated that although this speech was very mild regarding the Soviet Union, it was related to northern China. Although it is true that they fear the Communist Party, "There is particular fear that those who are good at taking advantage of opportunities will use the threat of the Communist Party as a means of convenience."

<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also holds meetings to study</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, key officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs discussed policy toward China with Kawagoe. It is said that Kawagoe will be formally appointed as Ambassador to China by the Emperor on May 12th, and will depart to take office in June. When asked about the smuggling in North China, Kawagoe replied, "The best and simplest way to stop smuggling is to reduce tariffs, because the tax rates in North China are extremely high. The tax on rayon and sugar is more than 20 times the cost." He also said that he did not believe that a secret military agreement had been established between China and Russia. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita has decided to hold a meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs leadership with the new Ambassador Kawagoe as the center, to study Japan's policy toward China, consider relations with the Soviet Union, the attitude of Inner and Outer Mongolia, and the general situation in China, etc., and establish a policy toward China, and decide on the instructions to be carried by Ambassador Kawagoe to China. Foreign Minister Arita is determined to cooperate with the military to remove political reasons that hinder Sino-Japanese relations, so that after Kawagoe takes office, Japan's diplomacy toward China will proceed with the second phase of the so-called "three principles." (9th, DOMEI News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, arrived in Tokyo at 9 PM on the 8th. Kawagoe made the following remarks regarding the recent situation in China: "The North China Incident last year should be examined for its true economic significance. That is, the North China incident has a major significance in eliminating the political reasons that illegally suppress legitimate Japanese economic demands. As a result, Japan's economic development is on track, and Japan's economic position in North China is rapidly unfolding. The Chinese Communist Army previously reached Shanxi, but it seems unlikely that they will be able to advance eastward. If the Communist Army invades the east, the Hebei-Chahar government should suppress them. If the situation worsens, the Japanese army stationed in China cannot remain silent. The adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is the main focus of diplomacy toward China. What China lacks today is scientific knowledge. I believe that we should expect its development with the economic and technical guidance of the Japanese, and at the same time increase good neighborly and friendly relations."

<p>Said to be beneficial to our country after its establishment; US still needs 73 million ounces of silver</p>
<p>(Washington) The US still needs 73 million ounces of silver. Currency experts here today declared that if China and the United States establish an agreement on silver and exchange rates, China's surplus financing will benefit greatly and will help China's foreign trade. According to the latest official statistics, China's imports totaled 203 million yuan in the first four months of this year, while exports were 165 million yuan, resulting in an import surplus of 38 million yuan. Compared to each other, although the import and export are limited, China's foreign trade has shown a slight export surplus since the last four months of last year, but since then it has always been an import surplus, so the future is difficult to be optimistic. Furthermore, the recent smuggling in North China has greatly impacted China's tax revenue. Semi-official estimates are that the current tax-evading goods in the Shanghai and northern regions account for 20% to 25% of the total amount. (8th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to official figures released recently, the US Treasury Department needs 730 million ounces of silver in addition to the silver it had on April 30th in order to complete its silver purchasing program. The Treasury Department had a total of 1.91 billion ounces on April 30th, worth 2.465 billion yuan. The increase in April was less than 28 million ounces. However, in addition to this, the Treasury Department also has some silver in its equalization fund and in transit or in foreign reserves. Therefore, observers believe that the United States' large-scale purchase of Chinese silver as a result of recent negotiations should enable the silver purchasing program to be completed as soon as possible. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Metal Statistics Bureau announced today that the world's gold production in March, including the Soviet Union, totaled 2,224,000 ounces, compared to 1,960,000 ounces in March last year.

The amount of gold mined in the United States in March totaled 313,000 ounces, compared to 276,000 ounces in February. Silver mining in the United States is also on the rise. The amount of silver mined in the United States in March totaled 5,329,000 ounces, compared to 5,056,000 ounces in March last year. The amount of silver mined in the first three months of this year totaled 14,759,000 ounces, compared to 9,083,000 ounces in the same period last year. (8th, National News Agency)</p>

<p>(Paris) The cabinet will hold a meeting on Saturday afternoon at 4 pm in order to decide on the attitude that France should adopt in Geneva. According to sources in the Foreign Ministry, France will adopt a wait-and-see attitude during the current session of the League of Nations Council. The French cabinet is currently in a transition period between old and new, and the current government is unwilling to take action that would hinder the actions of the future cabinet. These sources also believe that the Abyssinian issue should be handled only after the representatives of the Council member states have studied the new situation at length.

<h3 id="e58">League of Nations Meeting Tomorrow: Sanctions Against Italy to be Maintained; British Public Opinion Firmly States That the League Secretariat Also Declares the Status of Abyssinia Remains Unchanged <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(London) Viscount Cecil stated in a speech at the League of Nations Association meeting today that the League must maintain sanctions against Italy, and even intensify them if necessary. Ten thousand listeners cheered in unison.</p>
<p>Cecil continued, saying that the British people had not been so moved since the death of General Gordon. The Emperor of Abyssinia is a true hero, willing to go into exile rather than accept dishonorable treatment after being betrayed by those he trusted. As long as there is a glimmer of hope, the British people cannot recognize any other government in Abyssinia. Abyssinia remains a member of the League of Nations and is entitled to the collective protection it has been promised. Subsequently, Attlee, the leader of the Labor Party (opposition party) in the House of Commons, proposed a resolution declaring support for the League of Nations and the principle of collective security, expressing indignation at the invasion of Abyssinia, and urging the British government to maintain sanctions until Italy is prepared to accept peace terms recognized by the League of Nations. The resolution was passed unanimously amidst great excitement. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) With the League of Nations Council meeting approaching, the British attitude towards the sanctions issue urgently needs to be discussed with the governments of the various Dominions in order to determine a policy. Foreign Secretary Eden recently convened a meeting with Sir James Parr, the High Commissioner of New Zealand in the United Kingdom; Bruce, the High Commissioner of Australia; Waterson, the High Commissioner of South Africa; and Massey, the High Commissioner of Canada, to discuss this issue. It is reported that each of these High Commissioners stated that if the Italo-Abyssinian dispute cannot be resolved within the framework of the League of Nations, their respective Dominion governments would firmly oppose the abolition of sanctions. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures believe that at the upcoming session of the League of Nations Council, a resolution will likely be passed stating that a solution is only appropriate if it is deemed acceptable by the League of Nations, and the discussion of a solution will be postponed until the next session. This would not cause any dissent in Britain. However, if Italy were to declare the annexation of Abyssinia before the Council session, the stance adopted by Britain would completely change, possibly becoming more assertive. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) All British morning newspapers anticipate that the League of Nations Council meeting on Monday will not take any drastic steps regarding the Abyssinian issue and will adjourn. In other words, the current sanctions against Italy will continue in their current form. The Times states that the Council may decide that the most beneficial plan at present is to take no action for the time being, and asks, "Who says that no concrete steps can be taken in a matter of weeks or months?" (Reuters, 8th/9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is expected to announce his views on the de jure status of Abyssinia tonight. However, officials at the League of Nations Secretariat state that the status of Abyssinia cannot be altered by unilateral actions, and therefore Abyssinia's envoy to France, Walde, should still be recognized as the legitimate representative of that country to the League of Nations Council.

<p>(Geneva) The representatives of Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark held a meeting this morning to discuss the new situation in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The chairman, the Danish representative Munch, decided that the meeting should continue this afternoon. The representatives of Spain and Switzerland will also attend. Political figures here attach considerable importance to this meeting, believing that these countries, the so-called "countries without direct interests," have decided to jointly pressure the League of Nations Council to take immediate action to maintain the authority of the League of Nations. Switzerland alone holds a different view, advocating the lifting of sanctions against Italy. All of these countries are expected to express their support for Germany's return to the League of Nations. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) With the League of Nations Council meeting imminent, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Finland, and seven other countries are scheduled to hold a meeting here tomorrow to discuss the new situation in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute and the current situation of the Locarno Pact, in order to determine a common position for these countries. According to League of Nations officials, Denmark and Spain are both members of the Council, and the decisions made at the seven-nation meeting will be entrusted to the representatives of Denmark and Spain to vigorously uphold in the Council. Therefore, the nature of the meeting should not be taken lightly. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Major Attlee, the leader of the British opposition Labour Party, along with the secretary of the late Henderson, the former chairman of the Disarmament Conference, arrived here this morning. They immediately visited Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party in France, and on behalf of the British Labour Party, congratulated him on his party's victory in the recent election. Observers believe that Major Attlee's visit is of an informal nature, with the intention of exchanging information. The leaders of the parties affiliated with the Second International are required to meet periodically to provide information on the state of public opinion in their respective countries. The current congress of the Second International is scheduled to be held in Brussels next week. Léon Blum was originally scheduled to attend, but due to the results of the parliamentary elections, he is about to form a new cabinet and cannot leave Paris. The British Labour Party representatives have therefore come to Paris to meet and exchange information. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Major Attlee, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, will soon travel to France to meet with Léon Blum, the leader of the orthodox Socialist Party in that country. The purpose of this trip is to explain the British opposition's attitude towards the sanctions issue to Léon Blum. Regarding this matter, Labour Party figures not only hope that the cabinet to be formed by the French left-wing Popular Front will maintain the current sanctions, but also believe that the various parties of that faction now have sufficient power to ensure that the current government maintains the status quo of the sanctions until the new cabinet is formed, and then the new cabinet will fulfill its duties. Members of Parliament have also commented extensively on Attlee's mission, believing that both Britain and France are willing to strengthen the collective security mechanism to save the position of the League of Nations and prevent it from collapsing due to the Abyssinian issue.

<p>Addis Ababa: The Italian army is currently handling the restoration of administrative work in Addis Ababa, having divided the entire city into four districts, each with a general office. Each has 30 border guards in customs guard uniforms and 70 inspectors. The inspectors are currently searching for stolen goods house by house and arresting those who are hiding them. The chief inspector is currently receiving various weapons, such as knives, swords, guns, etc., voluntarily surrendered by Abyssinians at the city hall, while the lower level of the city hall is detaining Abyssinians of various ages and appearances awaiting trial, most of whom are only accused of theft. It is not thought that they will be severely punished, but the detainees either do not admit to robbery or claim that what they are carrying is their own property, so it is difficult for the inspectors to determine their guilt. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party is scheduled to meet at the Palazzo Venezia tonight, after which Prime Minister Mussolini will deliver a radio broadcast to make a definitive decision on the de jure status of Abyssinia.

<p>Addis Ababa: Several embassies, including the American embassy, today requested the Italian military authorities to send troops to protect their property. General Badoglio, the commander-in-chief of the Italian army, acceded to the request and sent troops to clear armed thugs in the city and suburbs. The German envoy to Abyssinia officially visited General Badoglio today. It is rumored that this move is equivalent to Germany recognizing Abyssinia as a territory of Italy. (Guomin, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is rumored that General Badoglio, the Supreme Commissioner of East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, has been in close contact with foreign embassies there since being stationed in the Abyssinian capital. Responsible parties have denied this, saying that the purpose of various countries setting up embassies in Addis Ababa was originally to conduct diplomacy with the Abyssinian government, but since that government no longer exists, the embassies have also lost their purpose. Their continued existence is only for the sake of protecting the nationals of those countries. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian officials deny the rumor that Italy intends to train a powerful coloured army in Abyssinia and have instructed the Italian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, to refute the rumor to the British government. It is heard that General Badoglio, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, has declared to the embassies in Addis Ababa that the Italian army can still protect the people of all countries as a gesture of goodwill, but without diplomatic functions. The Italian authorities in Addis Ababa have officially reopened the Bank of Abyssinia, and the masses are scrambling to exchange their Abyssinian currency for Italian currency. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: After being guarded for several days by 30 Askaris soldiers carrying old-fashioned 1890 rifles, the manager of the Bank of Abyssinia, Wright, has reached an agreement with the Italian authorities on the method of reopening the bank today. The bank's funds, amounting to 1.5 million thalers (Abyssinian currency), are said to be under the control of the Italian authorities. The large store opened by British Indian Muhammad Ali has been preserved intact due to the protection of the British Embassy's Indian troops. It is now crowded with customers, and the inventory may be sold out today. Italian soldiers are now searching everywhere for stolen goods from robbers, and those found are piled up in front of the city hall. There are also sewing machines and many suitcases. Robbers and stragglers are now fleeing from the capital to the countryside, causing trouble. An Italian rescue team was attacked, the driver was killed, and the rest were injured. Another group of bandits burned down a large, newly built hotel 30 miles from Addis Ababa, stripped the owner's wife of her clothes, and threw both her and her husband out of the window.

<p>(London) According to messages received here, Abyssinia has now become a closed country. No one is allowed to cross the border except for personnel of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway who have Italian passports. The last member of the Abyssinian government arrived in Djibouti today. Mr. Taegne was greatly frightened along the way, as a military vehicle full of Italian soldiers was closely following his car.

<h3 id="e68">France Bans Gold Exports, But Will Not Abandon the Gold Standard; Securities Market Fluctuations are Drastic <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Paris banks today restricted the sale of gold coins and foreign currencies. The Banking Association has notified all banks that cash and foreign banknotes may only be sold when absolutely necessary. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Paris is filled with rumours that a gold ban will soon be implemented and that private individuals will not be allowed to purchase gold. However, key figures in the banking world say that the government currently has no intention of abandoning the gold standard policy advocated by the Minister of Finance. This policy is limited to the government preventing cash outflows by raising bank interest rates and adopting various indirect methods. Securities market prices were still fluctuating quite drastically today. The outflow of gold has not diminished at all. The Minister of Finance met with the President today to try to save the situation, leading to rumours that the Minister of Finance intends to resign. Premier Sarraut also visited the Prime Minister. It is heard that the entire cabinet is scheduled to meet with the Prime Minister tomorrow. The market panic is mainly due to the expectation that Abyssinia will be annexed by Italy and that the French Fascist demonstration on Sunday may coincide with the Joan of Arc Festival memorial. It is estimated that since January 1, the amount of money withdrawn from French savings banks has reached 6,600,000,000 francs. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Observers here claim that the Paris Stock Exchange today banned all foreign exchange trading. Those in the know claim that this ban is aimed at speculators who short-sell. If they can no longer alleviate the pressure on the franc, the second step will be to manage the currency, and if necessary, even ban gold exports. (Guomin, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Firming Market in French Francs: Prevention Plan Only Temporarily Effective <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>(London) The French franc strengthened today after an initial weakening due to unconfirmed news from Paris that French banks have received informal orders restricting foreign exchange, no longer selling foreign currency or gold coins. It is heard that French authorities currently disapprove of forward transactions by French banks. It is rumored that the Bank of France has intervened to support the franc. London sources believe that France has now adopted a plan to allow the franc to rest slightly. Speculators are buying to cover short positions today, which is also one reason for the franc's rebound. Many in the London exchange market say that France's current plan to prevent capital flight will only be temporarily effective, as holders of francs are uneasy and will eventually find ways to bypass the existing obstacles.

<p>(Paris) President Lebrun received Léon Blum, leader of the orthodox Socialist Party and future Prime Minister, today to discuss the political situation. The President then met with Finance Minister Régnier to discuss the financial situation. After leaving the Presidential Palace, Léon Blum met with Édouard Daladier, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, and Prime Minister Sarraut for talks. The meeting was harmonious, with Sarraut providing a detailed explanation of the financial situation, stating that there was no cause for panic. Léon Blum then outlined the main points of the Socialist Party's platform after taking power, which the party's National Executive Committee is scheduled to approve on Sunday, to Sarraut, stating that the basic point of this platform is to restore public confidence in the national credit system and the production system of its natural industrial resources. It was also stated that "the main responsibility of the future cabinet is to strive to promote economic recovery." Regarding this, according to semi-official sources, the future cabinet will not implement any measures that would harm France's credit system or its active factors. After the talks, Prime Minister Sarraut told reporters that the Socialist Party will be the first to form a French cabinet. Léon Blum is aware that the future cabinet will inevitably encounter various difficulties and has decided to focus all efforts on the main issues, without dwelling on minor issues. Semi-official sources have also stated that the Communist Party's repeated declarations on the future cabinet's platform in recent days have caused public unease. In fact, the party is not prepared to join the cabinet, and its declarations are not without exaggeration. Léon Blum will deliver a speech this Sunday to reassure public opinion. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed a naval budget of $529,000,000 to build two battleships. It also stipulates the expenditure to build 18 smaller warships, 333 aircraft, and increase naval personnel to 100,000 men. The Marine Corps will be increased to 17,000 men. The bill has now been returned to the House for reconsideration. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed a naval bill providing for an expenditure of $531,000,000 in order to:</p>
<p>* Continue the construction of 84 warships currently underway.</p>
<p>* Build 16 new destroyers and 6 new submarines.</p>
<p>* Increase naval aviation equipment.</p>
<p>* Stockpile mineral products for wartime needs.</p>
<p>* Build two new battleships if other countries begin to replace their capital ships.</p>
<p>Before passing the bill, the Senate rejected a motion by Republican Frazier by a vote of 40 to 12 to delete the provision for building two battleships, six submarines, and twelve destroyers at a cost of $153,000,000. Frazier stated that the bill was completely contrary to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. "Do we want peace or war? That is the question," he said. This bill will ensure that the US Navy is not inferior to other countries. It has now been returned to the House along with Senate amendments. The aforementioned two battleships must wait until other signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty build capital ships before construction can begin. President Roosevelt stated today that he will submit the London Naval Treaty to Congress in the middle of next week. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the Foreign Relations Committee will begin reviewing the treaty next Saturday or Sunday. He could not predict whether the treaty would be approved during this session of Congress, as the matter depends on the legislative situation. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Lakehurst, New Jersey: The world's largest airship, the Hindenburg, departed from its base in Friedrichshafen, Germany, at 9:30 AM on Thursday for a flight across the North Atlantic to the United States. It arrived here safely at 6:10 AM this morning (local time), making the flight in 61 hours and 40 minutes, setting a new airship record. Thousands of New Jersey residents got up early to eagerly welcome the airship, and hundreds more gathered on the tops of tall buildings to wait for it overnight. The airship flew within a few hundred feet of the tops of tall buildings, so the crowds could see it very clearly. The airship mistook another mast for the mast designated to stop the airship and was in great danger when its bow approached it. The chosen mast had hundreds of soldiers standing below it to grab the descending mooring ropes, but this location had none. The field officer hesitated for a moment, unsure whether to signal the airship to fly upward quickly, but then suddenly had a flash of inspiration and shouted for some of the reporters and other personnel on the field to grab the ropes. The airship came to a safe stop only after this. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>From the Hindenburg Airship: The Hindenburg airship crossed the Atlantic today, encountering favorable winds and flying very fast. It is expected to fly over New York City on Saturday morning.

<h3 id="e72">British List of Questions on German Issue: German Press Criticizes Strongly, France Generally Satisfied <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Several German newspapers have criticized the British questions and the nature of the questions regarding Hitler's peace plan in severe terms. They agreed that they were surprised by the sudden publication of the article. The Frankfurter Zeitung said that it cannot be expected that the German government will quickly harm itself. This kind of inquiry is likely to lead to a dead end. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt said that the inquiry is very complicated and German readers need clear explanations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British list of questions regarding the German memorandum was published today. Foreign Ministry officials have praised it highly, but said that it is strange that two points were omitted from the list of questions:</p>
<p>* Germany's desire for colonies was not mentioned.</p>
<p>* No explanation was requested regarding Germany's distinction between Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
<p>In addition, the general public believes that France is eager to understand Germany's true intentions on certain key points before agreeing to negotiate. Most of these key points have been included in the British list of questions and should be clarified by Germany. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers have praised the British government's list of questions to Germany. L'Époque reported that this list of questions is diplomatic masterpiece, couched in euphemistic terms. All the difficult questions to answer have been listed without exception. However, the issue of colonies is not mentioned at all, because addressing this issue would inevitably provoke opposition from the British Dominions. Pertinax, a famous reporter for L'Echo de Paris, also published an article saying, "Although the British list of questions is weak and incomplete, it is enough to make it difficult for the German government to answer. However, the tone is moderate, and the German government can use more ambiguous terms to prevaricate when it submits its reply in the future. This is already well known to the German government." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The British government's list of questions to Germany, couched in euphemistic terms, has been widely praised by newspapers. The Manchester Guardian explained the reason for the hasty publication of the list of questions, stating, "Although the tone of this list of questions is extremely humble, its meaning is very strict. The British government originally did not want to publish it, but the German Foreign Ministry's explanations caused misunderstandings in international public opinion, so it was decided to publish it." The News Chronicle reported, "The tone of the list of questions is too humble, and its meaning is therefore ambiguous. Even if the German government answers them one by one, it will still be necessary to ask for further clarification in the future." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Semi-official sources have recently stated that the British government's list of questions to Germany was published after the British Ambassador to Germany, Phipps, consulted the German Foreign Ministry. It is not certain that the German government was completely unaware of it beforehand. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>Cairo: The new Egyptian Parliament has unanimously approved the establishment of a regency council. The term of the regency council is twenty-five months, as the new king will be eighteen years old at that time, according to Islamic custom, reaching the legal age of adulthood. This regency council is completely different from the one designated by King Fuad I in 1922. The names of the regents are listed in a register, sealed and stored, and were only taken to the House of Representatives today to be opened and read in public. The regents are Muhammad Ali, the second son of the late governor, Izzet, the former minister to Britain, and Sabry, the brother of the queen mother. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Cairo: The late King Fuad I's will advocated that former Prime Minister Nahas, former Prime Minister Adly, and Minister to France Fakry be appointed as regents. The new House of Representatives discussed the selection of regents today and rejected the list proposed by the late King, instead electing Prince Muhammad Ali (the late King's nephew), Achi Awan (former minister to Britain), and Sabry (the Queen Mother's brother) as regents. According to reports, this list was originally sealed and stored. When the House of Representatives met today, it was suddenly learned that the envelope had been opened beforehand and the list was not in it. There was great commotion.

<p>Third, regarding experiments, we should develop habits of cleanliness, agility, and caution. As mentioned earlier, chemistry is an experimental science. Without experiments and observations, we cannot talk about chemistry. Therefore, experiments are extremely important for students' progress. To conduct experiments, we must cultivate habits of cleanliness, agility, and caution, because if we are not clean, we often cannot obtain correct results. Once upon a time, there was a famous German chemist, V. Meyer. Once, when he was lecturing on the blue reaction of benzene and isatin, he performed an experiment on the spot for the students to see. As a result, he failed repeatedly. He had tried it successfully beforehand, but when he demonstrated it, it suddenly failed. Later, his assistant told him that the benzene used in the past was extracted from coal tar, but the benzene used this time was made in the laboratory from other substances. The benzene extracted from coal tar contains impurities. The benzene made in the laboratory is pure. The previous blue reaction was not a reaction of benzene, but a reaction of its impurities. From this, it can be seen that impure reagents will definitely affect the experimental results. If people who do chemistry experiments do not develop clean habits, these incorrect results will occur at any time. However, Meyer was a first-class chemist. Later, he used this error to study why impure benzene can produce a blue reaction with isatin. As a result, he discovered thiophene. As for agility, it is of course a very important habit, because agility represents your proficiency. Only when your procedure is proficient can you get satisfactory results. This is the proverb, "practice makes perfect." As for caution, it should be paid attention to, because if you are not careful, not only will the experiment often fail, but there is also the possibility of danger. For example, recently, a chemistry professor at Guangxi University, who was very experienced in the study of explosives, was experimenting with a large amount of explosives one day. His wife happened to come to the laboratory to see him. When he turned his head, he accidentally dropped the explosives on the ground and they exploded, killing him and seriously injuring his wife. It is inappropriate to use such a large amount of explosives for experiments. However, this professor relied on his extensive experience and thought there would be no problem. As a result, he suffered a tragic death. Even an experienced chemistry professor like him suffered such a tragic result due to occasional negligence. Then, of course, beginners should be more cautious about all experiments.</p>
<p>Regarding the attitude that should be taken when learning chemistry, first, we should have a desire for knowledge. Chemistry is not only closely related to people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but it can also be used to discover the mysteries of nature. Facts that were once regarded as mysterious can now be slowly discovered using chemical methods. For example, in terms of products, many things can not only be manufactured artificially, but the products made are much better than natural products. Many important chemical inventions almost all come from the "desire for knowledge" of chemists. A person with a desire for knowledge will be interested in what they learn and will not become discouraged when they encounter difficulties, but will seek deep understanding. Chemistry is the key to exploring the mysterious facts of nature, and only those who are extremely eager for knowledge can grasp this key. If we want to have considerable success in chemistry, we should pay attention to cultivating this desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>Second, we should develop habits of realism and precision. Everyone agrees that people who study should be realistic, but why do we emphasize the word precision? People who are new to chemistry may not all understand. Now I will give an example, and you will know why people who study chemistry cannot help but develop precise habits. In 1785, when Cavendish measured the composition of air, he mixed ordinary air with oxygen and then passed electricity through it to completely remove the nitrogen in the air by combining with oxygen. Although he tried many times, there was always a small amount of gas in the bottle that could not be removed. He thought that this little gas had little impact on the study of air composition, so he ignored it. A hundred years later, this small amount of gas was painstakingly studied by two chemists, Rayleigh and Ramsey, and as a result, the argon group of rare gases was discovered. To give another example: The great German organic chemist Liebig once had a factory send someone to ask him to analyze a kind of red liquid. He did not carefully examine it and concluded that the liquid was a mixture of chlorine and iodine. Later, the French chemist Balard discovered bromine, and this new element was the same thing as the red liquid that Liebig had. He greatly regretted that he should not have been so careless and deceived himself. These facts can prove that people who study chemistry should develop precise habits.</p>
<p>Third, we should have a firm spirit. The content of chemistry is complex and the scope is also very broad. It is not an easy science to learn. Especially when you are a beginner, you often feel overwhelmed when you see many formulas, theorems, and definitions. But if you can deal with it with a firm and courageous spirit, then you will not be discouraged when you encounter difficulties and will not achieve anything in your life. The famous German chemist Baeyer spent many years studying the structure of indigo before he succeeded. This kind of firm spirit is very admirable and worthy of our imitation.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should have independent habits. To learn chemistry well, it all depends on the students themselves. Whether the knowledge comes from teachers or books, if you do not carefully consider it with your own mind, you cannot have a deep understanding, and what you have learned cannot be considered your own knowledge. Although the knowledge gained from lectures or books can be said to be delicious food, if it is not digested by ourselves, then it will not benefit us. As for doing chemistry experiments, it is even more necessary to have independent habits. Needless to say, everything in the experiment must be done with your own hands. You must also carefully observe the various phenomena produced by the experiment and write them down in your own words, so that you can make real progress. Therefore, independent habits should also be cultivated. Some students like to copy other people's results when doing experiments. This is the worst habit and should be reformed.</p>
<p>Although there are many shortcomings in chemistry education in the past, there have been practical improvements recently. Therefore, chemistry education can be said to have reached a new stage. The above-mentioned improvement methods are just an outline for the education authorities. On the one hand, we must rely on the cooperation of middle school teachers and textbook editors across the country. On the other hand, we must also rely on middle school students across the country to work hard with a spirit of seeking truth in chemistry. Then, middle school chemistry education can have real hope for development. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e76">Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Investigate Smuggling in North China, All Kinds of Tax Revenues are Reduced, Smuggling Suppression Methods Need to Be Improved <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The serious situation of smuggling in North China has not yet been resolved. In reality, it involves various diplomatic issues and is not easy to eradicate in a short period of time. The Japanese side has great ambitions for tax revenues in North China. Smuggling is only one of its policies, using this to create an extraordinary state in North China. It cannot be stopped by mere words. The Hebei-Chahar authorities, according to the instructions of the central government, are still ordering Xiao Zhenying and Lin Shize to do their best to negotiate with the Japanese side. If they can obtain a glimmer of hope, it will be enough to plug a hole. Therefore, the current negotiations are still in progress. Since the Tianjin Customs implemented armed anti-smuggling at the Lao Tieshan Cape in the Bohai Bay, on the 6th of this month, it continued to intercept five smuggling steamships operated by Japanese ruffians near Qikou. There was a sensation at the time and a conflict occurred, but the ships were eventually detained by patrol boats. The ships arrived in Tianjin on the 7th, and the cargo, which included rayon, sugar, and seafood totaling more than 3,000 tons, has been confiscated. The Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Nagai, specifically visited Xu Lier, the Acting Inspector General of Customs, to protest this matter and demand the return of the ships and cargo. Negotiations have not yet been completed. It is heard that the Customs has expressed that it can return a small amount of the fines for the ships. However, due to the double difficulties of being located in the pseudo-East Hebei Inspection Office and smuggling by Japanese ruffians, any anti-smuggling methods are not easy to be effective in Qinhuangdao's seafood. On the 5th of this month, two customs officers were injured on the seashore of Liushouwangying. Fortunately, the security team under Zhang Yantian arrived and used force to disperse the Japanese ruffians, rescuing the customs officers. The ships and cargo were able to sail to the Qinhuangdao Customs pier to dock and be dealt with. The Ministry of Finance is paying close attention to the rampant smuggling in North China. The personnel dispatched recently arrived in Tianjin. In the past two days, they visited Mayor Xiao Zhenying, Tianjin Customs Superintendent Lin Shize, and Changlu Salt Commissioner Ge Dingyuan to inquire about the actual situation, so as to plan a perfect strategy. After staying in Tianjin for a week, Xiao will go to Baoding and then transfer to the four provinces of Chahar, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Henan to investigate. He will return to Beijing at the end of the month to report. According to someone, this time he was ordered to come north, first to Beiping, to investigate the silk tax bureaus of the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, and the tobacco and alcohol stamp tax bureau of Hebei Province. The unified tax of the four provinces has decreased by several million yuan due to smuggling. This time he came to Tianjin to investigate customs and salt taxes, and to pay attention to whether the competent authorities have fulfilled their responsibilities, so that he can report to the ministry for correction. The loss of customs duties due to rampant smuggling is very large. The ministry regards this as a part of the entire diplomatic situation and will seek an overall solution from the diplomatic aspect. Regarding the salt tax, due to environmental influences, the tax revenue in the Changlu area is not good. In order to rectify the national salt affairs, the central government has decided to implement the new salt law from the next year. It is heard that the old system of drawing boundaries will be completely broken, and people can freely sell and eat salt, free from multiple layers of exploitation, and salt tax revenue can also be more prosperous. As for the production of Lu salt, the ministry has ordered the Changlu Transport Office to handle it. For anti-smuggling in North China, because most of the smugglers belong to a certain country, earnestly investigating them is prone to disputes. Only by cracking down on profiteering merchants and assisting the chamber of commerce may be effective. He has already contacted the person in charge of the chamber of commerce in Beiping to discuss this matter, hoping that they will work hard. Upon arriving in Tianjin, he also conveyed the ministry's intentions. (9th)</p>

<p>Peiping Correspondence: Lieutenant General Tada Shun, Commander of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, has been transferred to become the Commander of the 11th Division and is scheduled to return to his country on the 24th of this month to take up his new post. On the 7th, he came to Peiping to host a tea party for Chinese and foreign dignitaries in Peiping as a farewell. On the 8th, he went by car to Tongxian to visit the pseudo-Eastern Hebei authorities, where Yin Rugeng prepared lunch to entertain him. Tada stayed in Tongxian to receive members, taking a chartered car prepared by the Beining Railway and attached to the Peiping express train to return to Tianjin. Qin Dechun, Shao Wenkai, Pan Yugui, Chen Zhongfu, Lin Gengyu, Lan Gongshi Xiaoliang, Hamada, Shimizu, Watanabe, and Nichihashi, as well as the Peiping Public Security Bureau Security Team band, went to the station to see him off. The following is a record of Tada's conversation with reporters before his departure: "I have now been transferred to the position of division commander and will soon return to my country, so I have nothing to say. I only hope that the general public of your country can live and work in peace and contentment, truly achieving co-existence and co-prosperity between the people of China and Japan. This is not only my personal hope, but also the hope of the general public of Japan."</p>
<p>"My impression of being in China is that many places in your country misunderstand the intentions of Japan and the garrison, leading to the misunderstanding that Japan is creating trouble out of thin air, taking the opportunity to invade China, and hindering China's unification efforts. The Empire is determined to eliminate this kind of thinking. Taking a family as an example, even parents and children should have the virtue of humility, let alone two countries. If the two countries do not yield to each other, it will be difficult to achieve true friendship. As for the two countries, they should help each other with their strengths and make up for their own shortcomings. Only by being kind and yielding to each other can there be success."</p>
<p>"During the Tang and Song dynasties, Japan had Chinese students who brought back a lot of Chinese culture and instilled it in the minds of the general public. This was taking the strengths of your country to make up for the weaknesses of our country. Now, Japanese culture is stronger than Chinese culture, and your country can also make use of Japan. China is a large country in East Asia and should cooperate with all its strength in order to maintain peace in East Asia. As for the extent to which Japanese culture has progressed, I hope you will visit our country to see for yourselves. You will know that the Japanese people have no ill feelings towards China, and you can also see that Japanese culture has reached an unimaginable level. If you want to go to our country, our country is willing to help you. The military attache Imai in Peiping and Major General Komuro can all be contacted. As the saying goes, seeing is believing. If you go to Japan, you will know what Japan hopes for from China and you can dispel all misunderstandings. I have now been transferred to Shikoku, which is a relatively large island in Japan with beautiful scenery. I hope you will visit it when you go to Japan in the future. I am willing to fulfill my responsibility as a guide."</p>
<p>"The Communist Party is the common enemy of China and Japan. I hope that the two countries can work together to repel communism and the Communist Party. The bandits' arrival in North China has had a great impact, which is quite noteworthy to us. Recently, the Communist bandits who entered Shanxi have now left the province, which is a gratifying thing. If the Communist bandits attack Outer Mongolia to the north, the problem will be serious."</p>
<p>"The smuggling problem in North China refers to goods imported from the coast of Eastern Hebei. The goods imported from the coast of Eastern Hebei have already paid a quarter of the tax in accordance with the 'Eastern Hebei' regulations and cannot be considered smuggling. If the Chinese government lowers tariffs, smuggling can be avoided." From this, it can be seen that the other side is using smuggling to coerce our country into lowering tariffs. The reason is very clear. Tada also said that he had not heard of any concrete plans regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, or the extent to which he had contacted the Economic Committee. However, he expected that this matter was still under research and negotiation. "Today I am going to Tongxian for only one hour, so I have no impressions or thoughts." (8th)</p>

The provincial government allocated funds to repair the Wei Lake Dam, and the China International Famine Relief Commission also allocated funds to repair the highways in Xuzhou District, recruiting disaster-stricken workers to provide relief through labor. The commission allocated a total of 40,000 yuan for this project and sent Chief Engineer Baker to Xuzhou for inspection. Initially, it was proposed to repair the embankments, but because the Yellow River water had not receded and the embankment repair project was too large, with limited funds, it was changed to repairing the highways. After Baker's survey, he sent Zhang Jichun to Xuzhou to supervise the repair, and Pastor Peng Yongen, stationed in Xuzhou, presided over the work, gathering 2,500 disaster-stricken workers to repair five highways and one ring road: The Tongpei Road, from the north of the city to Pingshankou, is 50 li long. The entire road from the north of the city to Pingshankou is a gravel road. It will cost 15,000 yuan to add a flat road to the mountain pass. The Guanshan project will also cost 4,000 yuan, making it the most labor-intensive of the roads to be repaired. The Tongqiao Road, from the south of the city to Liangshankou, is 30 li long. The entire road, built with sand mixed with earth by Jing Fanni, is 30 li long and will cost 1,300 yuan. The Tongxiao Road, from the west of the city to Yaolou, is 30 li long. It has always been well-managed and has not been severely damaged, requiring only minor repairs and costing little. The Tongsux Road, from the south of the city to Sanguanmiao, is 10 li long. The route is shorter and will not cost much. As for the ring road, it is being repaired and connected and is now completed. The disaster-stricken workers employed are all recruited from along the banks of Wei Lake, gathering strong men and the elderly alike to provide relief. Each worker is paid 2 to 3 jiao. Each road surface is 12 meters wide, allowing cars and ox carts to pass, with separate lanes for upstream and downstream traffic. All work is expected to be completed by the end of this month, at which time it will be inspected and accepted by the provincial government. (May 6)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Rich Mineral Deposits in Southern Anhui, It is Proposed to Improve Iron Smelting in Counties such as Liu'an, Stibnite in Xiuning and Western Anhui Contains 70% Antimony <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province is known throughout the country for its rich production of rice and grain, but it is not widely known that southern Anhui is mountainous and contains countless mineral resources. Unfortunately, due to the changing times, no one has paid attention to them. For example, the annual production of bamboo and wood in Jingxian and Xuancheng is enormous, with the raw materials being transported and sold outside the province. The value of the processed bamboo shoots and Xuan paper is even more considerable, which is clear evidence. In recent years, the Ministry of Industry and the Anhui Provincial Government have paid much attention to southern Anhui and have repeatedly dispatched technical experts to conduct inspections. The Anhui Construction Department has established a Mining Survey Team and a Geology and Mineral Resources Department. However, due to insufficient funds from the provincial government, the above organizations could not be maintained for long. After the determination of the construction plan for the 25th year of the Republic, it was generally believed that it was necessary to re-establish them and actively carry out the work. It has been decided that the coal mines in the northern townships of Guangde County, such as Daxiao Niutoushan, are all high-quality bituminous coal with thick coal seams and abundant reserves. They have been taken over by the province as official mines and will be mined in accordance with the law after obtaining a license. (2) An area of the Huolonggang coal mine in Wuhu County, which was originally contracted by the Huaxing Company, has now been shut down. It has been decided to recruit other merchants to contract it to avoid abandonment. (3) Last year, an area of tin mine was discovered at Dadagang in Xixian County. It is planned to apply for a prospecting license in accordance with the law and conduct exploration. (4) Taihu, Qianshan, Liu'an, and Lihuang counties have historically produced iron sand. Local residents have long used native furnaces to smelt iron and make various utensils, which have been widely sold and can suppress foreign goods. It has been decided to find ways to improve the smelting process to increase production. (5) The stibnite mines in Xishangxikou Ligangshan area of Huizhou Prefecture's Xiuning County have been repeatedly verified by Ding Yi and other investigators from the Industrial Experimentation Institute, containing 68% to 70% antimony, and the quantity is extremely large, which can be mined for 40 years. The Construction Department has obtained a license from the ministry and plans to invite merchants to jointly operate with the government. The extension of the Jiangnan Railway will take the mine area route to facilitate transportation. (May 8)</p>

<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>(3) Qunke Beach Mongolian Banner</p>
<p>One Night in a Black Tent</p>
<p>After crossing another layer of mountain slopes, we reached our destination - Qunke Beach. A dozen or so tents were stationed in the mountain gully, interspersed with two white circular yurts. They were separated from each other by a great distance. The guide led us to dismount in front of a black tent near the yurt. This place was forty li away from Baiyang Gorge, and the pointer on the barometer stopped at 3260 meters.</p>
<p>A woman wearing a pointed hat came out of the tent, held back the large sheepdog, and an old man pulled up the curtain to let us in. I sat down on a velvet flower cushion on the left side of the stove, and the old man also came in with a smile. He was the local Wang, Erlike Beile - Linqin Hujiu Zhajile. His simple attire (wearing an ordinary old sheepskin coat) almost made us mistake him for an ordinary commoner.</p>
<p>We decided to stay here tonight, and the Ula (messenger horses) were sent back. The afternoon's strong wind had long been roaring on the cotton-candy tent top, and the wooden poles supporting the tent were blown down from time to time.</p>
<p>At this time, we were being entertained by the Wang, sitting down by the stove drinking fragrant and salty milk tea. In the wooden box in front of us, there was a grid of ghee (butter), a grid of curds, and a grid of tsampa (roasted barley flour), as well as a plate of freshly boiled blood-water beef taken from the steaming pot (large pieces of half-cooked beef still dripping with blood), which we were free to enjoy.</p>
<p>After drinking tea, we talked about the life, history, religion, and everything else of the Mongolians. However, their Chinese was not very fluent, and none of us understood Mongolian, so when the two sides could not express themselves, the police used tea language to replace it.</p>
<p>The Wang also took out a phonograph from his yurt. Now, although they had the machine, they didn't know how to turn it on and play it, because his son had already gone to Xining. We started to wind up the spring and played a few records, but they were tired of this kind of entertainment.</p>
<p>In the evening, the wind subsided a little, and the yaks on the eastern mountain and the sheep on the western mountain were driven back by the shepherds. They were all busy for a while, surrounding the sheep and tethering the yaks before preparing their dinner. Today, because there were guests, his intelligent new daughter-in-law took the initiative to make a noodle dish that the Han people often eat, cooking a fishy and salty soup noodle with blood-water beef soup.</p>
<p>At night, we unfolded the canvas marching bed where we were sitting. They had never seen it before and looked at it with surprise under the bed. In the dark night, the embers in the stove spat out bright sparks, illuminating the four corners of the tent. Our candles, on the other hand, swayed without light.</p>
<p>The Wang's female relatives and the Wang went to sleep in the yurt to avoid strangers. In the dark tent, only the three of us and the police, two lamas, and an uncle (the Wang's steward) were left. We chatted by the fire for a while and then went to sleep on the left and right sides of the guests and hosts.</p>
<p>The wind at night was even more violent than during the day. Tiny gusts of wind drilled into the tent through the felt, and a piece of black felt was patched over the window seam on top of the cotton candy. The temperature inside the tent had dropped to minus twelve degrees. The sparks in the stove were also gradually diminishing. The roaring storm made the curtain jump and boom, as if it was about to break free from the shackles and fly away. I covered myself with the quilt and went to sleep, but my feet did not feel warm all night. In my dream, I was awakened from time to time by the howling wind outside the cotton candy. At this time, I felt the severity and greatness of the darkness even more.</p>
<p>When I got up the next morning at dawn, the outside of the tent was covered in white snow. The whistling wind had not subsided at all, and the snow was still falling.</p>
<p>Erlike Beile</p>
<p>Chief Erlike Beile is the Prince of the Right Wing Tou Banner of the "Choros Tribe", and is now over sixty years old. He has two pigtails on his upper lip, and his nasal tubes were damaged in his childhood. He speaks entirely with a humming nasal tone, otherwise he could speak a few sentences of Chinese.</p>
<p>He is an enlightened old Wang, who has been to Beijing seven times, twice during the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, although he lives in a grass mountain tent, he is very familiar with the situation outside. His wife has also been to Beijing seven times, so she is now a virtuous woman.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, he received the Second Class Medal from President Li Yuanhong. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the Mongolian flag organization in Qinghai slightly changed, and he was appointed as the Right Wing Zhengmeng Chief. Now he has the power to command the twelve banners in eastern Qinghai, but there are very few people in his own banner. There are only seventy tents grazing in this area, and only a little more than a hundred in total, including "Baiyang Gorge" and "Qiabuqia". His grazing land was originally in "Qiabuqia" in "Shang Guomi" in Hainan. Recently, due to the migration of Tibetans, his grazing land has shrunk. He has been stationed in Zhouhong here for fifty years. Zhouhong is the pasture of the "Qunke Wang" and is still borrowed from the Qunke Wang.)</p>
<p>His family includes two Taijis (princes), who are currently studying at the Ningmeng Tibetan School, a daughter, a daughter-in-law, a wife, an uncle (steward), two male and female slaves, a cow herder (cowherd boy), and a lama.</p>
<p>His property includes 600 sheep, 200 cattle, 60 horses, two yurts, a black tent, and his yamen in Zhazang Temple.</p>
<p>Mongolian Dress</p>
<p>For those who first arrive in Qinghai, it is difficult to distinguish between the dress of the Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups, and they often mistakenly point to the Mongolians. Indeed, this is because there are few differences in their clothing, but if you pay attention, you can also find some significant differences on their bodies. As for the reasons why their clothing is similar, it is said that in recent times, the Tibetan forces in Qinghai have become stronger and the Mongolian forces have gradually declined, so the clothing style has become Tibetanized, and even the language and writing tend to be Tibetan.</p>
<p>The dress of the women here often consists of a round-collared old sheepskin coat, with no lining and a two-inch wide red edge around the edges, with the hem reaching the ground. The rich use purple, blue, or black satin or cloth facings, and a red belt is tied around the waist. On the left side of the body hangs a four-inch long milk hook (a copper hook for milking cows) and a chicken heart-shaped silver plate, which is mostly engraved with flowers and inlaid with gemstones. There are two types of hats: one is a fur ear hat, with two ear flaps on the left and right sides that can be folded down in cold weather, and a large red knot on the top of the hat, with a braid of thread tassels attached; the other is a pointed lambskin hat, with a black wool top and a red circle around the bottom, sewn with a circle of white lambskin. It looks like a hot pot when worn on the head. The top of the hat's wool peak (half of it is decorated with a very delicate bright red tassel, which is the point that differs from the Tibetan dress. Their hair is divided into two strands from the top of the head, drooping from the ears to the chest, and bound with a two-inch wide and three-foot long country flower braid, tied in the middle of the waistband, and the braid still floats down to the ground. Their hairstyle is very different from the braids of Tibetan women that drag on the back, but many young girls who have not yet reached the age of maturity often comb small braids and spread them behind their backs. Their lower bodies may not wear pants for the sake of convenience, and they are accustomed to wearing a kind of hard-soled boots made of cowhide with bare feet.</p>
<p>Men's outerwear is an old sheepskin coat, with pants and hard-soled boots. Hats can be pointed hats, and the wealthy wear fox fur hats. Men's sheepskin coats are mostly raised to below the knees to facilitate riding. Most Mongolians also keep long hair on the top of their heads and comb it into a half-foot long thin braid, coiled in the hat.</p>
<p>Mongolian Life</p>
<p>The life of the Mongolians in Jike Beach is still stagnant in a nomadic society, with no fixed abode, moving with the water and grass. Women's work is often more diligent than men's. Men and women, except for external exchanges or military wars, stay idle in the cotton candy. Women have to milk cows, boil tea, and cook meat in the morning and evening, and take care of household chores in their spare time.</p>
<p>Their diet is based on beef, mutton, ghee, tsampa, curds, and tea. They usually eat three meals a day, and drink more than they eat. Each meal must be accompanied by several bowls of thick juice brewed from brick tea, mixed with a few spoonfuls of fresh milk, ghee, tsampa, and curds. After drinking the tea, they take a bowl of tsampa, mix it with tea and ghee, and knead it into fist-sized dough balls, which is the formal meal. They also eat a lot of beef and mutton from time to time, but the meat is boiled into half-cooked blood-water meat, which outsiders think is unpalatable, but they think it is not delicious without it.</p>
<p>Their residences are either black tents or yurts, because they are easy to disassemble and move. There are more black tents than yurts in this area, which is also due to the influence of Tibetanization. Yurts are made of sheep's wool felt, with ribs made of forest strips inside, forming a conical-shaped tent. It is usually one zhang in diameter, and a piece of felt is hung on the door as a curtain. The interior is very warm in winter. Black tents are made of the wool of yaks, which does not seep water, so they will not leak even in the heavy rain. Black cotton candy rooms are square, with two wooden poles supporting a stick as a beam in the middle, and four pillars supporting it on all sides, and then more than a dozen wool ropes are used to tie it tightly. The dark sound of the tent is built with a long mud trough, which burns dry yak dung day and night. A long gap is opened in the middle of the top of the account as a chimney for the stove, and a piece of complex curtain is sewn on top, which can be covered when it snows and rains. Around the tent are piles of wooden boxes and leather bags, used as attached walls to prevent the invasion of wind and rain.</p>
<p>Their seats are divided by the stove, men on the left and women on the right, with few disturbances. If a newly arrived male guest mistakenly steps into the female host's seat on the right, it will easily cause their laughter. Their sleeping places at night are also the same, men on the left and women on the right. Even if they are husband and wife, they should be separated in this way on the surface. They mostly sleep in clothes, cross their waists as a quilt, and do not use lights at night. The firelight in the stove can illuminate the whole curtain. They get up and go to bed very early, and have a primitive way of life of getting up at sunrise and resting at sunset.</p>
<p>Mongolian Economy</p>
<p>The Mongolians in Jike Beach do not have a single tent that has a camel, because the pasture here is a prairie, which is not suitable for the survival of camels. It is said that the Panchen Lama had 200 camels placed here last year, and more than half of them had died in just a few months. The Qinghai Mongolians who raise camels are all in the "Salt Lake" and "Zidam" areas in Haixi, where there are deserts, so it is suitable for the survival of camels, the ships of the desert.</p>
<p>However, they raise a lot of cattle and sheep. A few wealthy families have thousands of sheep, hundreds of cattle, and hundreds of horses. Ordinary households that can support themselves also have one hundred sheep and dozens of cattle.</p>
<p>The nomadic people are also inevitably obligated to pay taxes to the local government. There are seventy tents in Jike Beach, and they share 1,000 yuan of grass tax every year. Half of them are poor and cannot afford the heavy tax, so only thirty to forty tents share it every year.</p>
<p>Local prices are: sheep three yuan, cattle twenty yuan, horse one hundred yuan, sheep wool ten yuan per dan, white lambskin one yuan per piece, black lambskin two yuan per piece, brick tea four yuan per package, wheat twenty yuan per dan of 500 jin, and qingke twelve yuan per dan of 900 jin.</p>
<p>Most people's economic conditions are very poor, and often their necessary daily necessities are dragged on by borrowing money. For example, a package of brick tea worth four yuan is raised to five yuan. By the next year, merchants will come to collect lambskins and sheep to ask for a price. As for their trading methods, they also mostly barter.</p>
<p>Although their economy is tight, the men are always happy and sit peacefully in the tent, not wanting to engage in production, so the interest on loans has reached 5%.</p>

<p>Huang Zuqiang, a patrol chief from the Second Substation in this city, led police officers to the fourth household of the twenty-fourth insurance of the fourth ward of Longtan Town around 10 pm on the 29th of last month. He falsely claimed that there was an official document from Taicang to arrest Cai Danren, who had just moved from Taicang. If he could produce 80 yuan for going abroad, the matter could be resolved. He also forced the Jia chief Li Jinfu to be invited over. In the end, he still returned the receipt. The matter was heard by the town chief of the town, who said that the patrol chief had repeatedly harassed the neighborhood in the name of investigating cigarettes. Now, he is extorting money and coercing the Jia chief. This not only harms the people but also damages the reputation of the police. He has sent a letter to the substation to report the matter. It is heard that Inspector Luo has verified that the matter is true. It is unknown how the authorities will punish him.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Suzhou, Fresh Meat Industry Asks for Exemption from Business Tax <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The meat shops in Suzhou City have recently experienced a tight supply of pigs, and there may be no goods available for sale. Therefore, it is planned to stop slaughtering for several days starting on the 10th. The Fresh Meat Industry Association believes that this matter is related to the entire city market, so it specially convened a meeting of all members on the afternoon of the 9th to discuss solutions. The industry is also unable to bear the business tax levied by the Wuxian Business Tax Bureau, and it is necessary to reduce or exempt it. The industry already pays a tax of about 5 jiao per pig slaughtered. If they have to pay business tax again, they will be unable to bear it and it would violate the principle of one tax per item. A special request was submitted to the county chamber of commerce on the 9th, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting exemption from business tax. If business tax must be collected, please exempt the slaughter tax to comply with the government's one-tax-per-item law and maintain business.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Wuxi: The Truth About the Explosion <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>It was previously reported in this newspaper that a loud explosion occurred at 2 PM on the 8th at Zhao Changsheng's residence, number 18, Yiyuan Alley, Chang'an Bridge, outside the North Gate. Wu Gonghe, an apprentice named Shen Hongxing from the Yiji Firecracker Shop, was killed instantly, and an elderly woman named Zhu Zhangshi and a child named Zhu Shengxian, along with five others, were injured. It is now known that the loud noise was indeed caused by an explosive detonation. Wu Gonghe and his apprentice Shen Hongxing, after lunch that day, were inside the Yiyuan Alley residence, mixing 15 catties of newly heated potassium nitrate with sulfur in a large earthenware basin, with a small jar of phosphorus nitrate placed on top. They intended to carry it in a bamboo basket to the shop in Tantou Alley to crush it and make firecrackers. However, when they reached the front of Zhao Changsheng's house, the phosphorus nitrate was heated by the vapor of the already heated potassium nitrate, causing the explosion. The entire city was shaken. At the time, the sound of gongs and drums was deafening, and people suspected a fire. Fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene, only to discover that there was no fire, but rather an explosive detonation. The court was notified by the Fourth Precinct chief, and at 5 PM, Prosecutor Shen, accompanied by Coroner Wang, went to investigate. It was found that the deceased, Shen Hongxing, had his right eye blown away, and two holes were blown into his temple and next to his right ear. His pants were severely torn, with only a small piece of waist cloth remaining. His left leg was also blown off, and a large amount of flesh was blown away from the back of both legs, leaving a bloody mess.

<h3 id="e96">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Persuades Ice-Fresh Industry Yesterday to Join the Fish Market; Representatives of the Industry Promise to Consider and Reply to the Fish Market Board of Directors Tomorrow; The Fish Market Board of Directors Reviewed the Qualifications of Brokers Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market will hold an opening ceremony tomorrow morning at 10 AM. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, acting on the instructions of the Ministry of Industry, invited representatives of the ice-fresh fish industry for talks yesterday afternoon, earnestly urging them to join the market. The Board of Directors held a meeting at 4 PM yesterday afternoon to prepare for the opening. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Obeys Orders to Persuade Them to Join</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce invited members of the ice-fresh industry association, including Gongda, Qianfeng, and Shengji, a total of 13 companies, for talks at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. A total of six representatives attended, and Chairman Yu Zuoting and Secretary Yan E'sheng advised them. First, they reported that they were obeying the Ministry of Industry's order to deeply understand the central government's intention to improve fish market transactions, urging them to join the fish market and earnestly comply. Then, the representatives stated that there were practical difficulties in joining the fish market, roughly divided into three points: 1. It is not easy to recover the loans previously extended by the fish shops. 2. It is impossible to maintain business with a commission of 3.5%. 3. The market is too far away, and transportation is inconvenient. They asked to consider the difficulties of the merchants and said that if the government had relief measures, the fish merchants would all agree. After Chairman Yu's repeated persuasion, the representatives agreed to go back and consider and reply on Monday. The meeting adjourned at approximately 3 PM.</p>
<p>The Market's Board of Directors Held a Meeting Yesterday</p>

The meeting adjourned at approximately 6 PM.</p>
<p>The Market Announces Opening Declaration</p>
<p>The Fish Market issued a declaration yesterday, saying, "Today, when statisticians discuss China, they use figures of over 400 million people and over 3.4 million square miles of Chinese territory, and over 270,000 square miles of Chinese territorial waters. They also know that the land is rich in resources but has not been fully developed, the ocean's production has not been fully utilized, and the people's strength has not been fully exhausted. Weighing the content of its strength, it is determined to be the strongest. Compared with the world's powers, everyone knows that no one can surpass it. This is why people ridicule us as a sleeping lion, and why Mussolini sighs that Italy does not have land as vast as China. Therefore, China's weakness, and even the painful experience of invasion, is not due to a lack of innate endowments, but rather to the failure of human affairs. This is why the ruling officials encourage the people to rely on their own efforts. To rely on one's own efforts means to estimate one's own strength, make good use of one's own strength, and develop one's own strength. Chairman Chiang's promotion of the New Life Movement, the initiative of national economic construction, and Minister Kong's plan for production and construction all deeply understand that the development of people's power and the acquisition and use of production are not fully exhausted. To follow the meaning of self-reliance, cultivate people's power, and advance production in order to seek the soundness of the national economic organization, it is a strategy of the ancient sages who valued the people's livelihood and enriched the country. The Ministry of Industry's establishment of the Shanghai Fish Market, initiated by former Minister Chen and completed by Minister Wu now, is aimed at following the Founding Father's legacy of government and people cooperation, reorganizing the fishing industry, and implementing the policy of saving the country through production that is needed today. China's fishing villages are scattered among the seven coastal provinces, and the total number of fishermen and fish merchants reaches tens of millions, comparable to the entire population of Britain and Germany. It is conceivable that the relationship with national power is of great importance. Therefore, our people should do their best to cooperate with the government's well-intentioned policies to reorganize the fishing industry and help it succeed, not only the fishermen and fish merchants should work together harmoniously. When reforming a business, at the beginning of the reform, there are often concerns, and some mistakenly believe that the reorganization agency will have facilities that are unfavorable to the past. This is actually confined to a corner of perspective, not a study of the overall situation, only counting the interests of a few people, not the interests of the country. According to a survey in 1933, the value of the nation's fishery products was approximately 50 million yuan, the value of imported foreign fish was approximately 40 million yuan, and it is estimated that the value of the territorial waters' fishery production in one year is approximately 400 million yuan. It can be seen that there is still surplus production, consumption has been encroached upon, and the path for fishery development is great and broad. Furthermore, in recent years, the decline of the fishing industry has been caused by economic weakness, the rampant acts of pirates, the dumping of foreign fish, or the mistake of useless competition. It is not caused by overproduction or insufficient consumption. Therefore, the necessity of reorganizing fishery administration is very obvious and there is no doubt that it is urgently needed in practice. Now, the government, based on the bright idea of developing the economy and saving the country through production, entrusts the responsibility of reorganizing fishery administration and guiding fishermen to this market. This is the mission of this market, which should plan to remove obstacles to the fishing industry and further seek ways to protect the fishing industry in order to make the goal of building a national economy, can speed up the completion of the period due to the development of fish production. Therefore, not only should the colleagues of this market comply with this will, work hard, and the fishermen of each fishing village should admire the good governance, work hard, and the fish merchants who are engaged in the fishing industry should carefully examine the advantages and disadvantages, eliminate jealousy and concerns, and seek sincere cooperation. Otherwise, our country's fishing industry will not only be insufficient to talk about construction, but also may not be able to survive in the international community where control is prevalent. This greatly affects economic construction. Out of love for ourselves and love for the country, we sincerely declare and hope that the wise will correct us."</p>
<p>Using Special Ferry to Pick Up Guests</p>
<p>The market will hold an opening ceremony tomorrow. A guest reception area has been specially set up on the second floor of the Bund Municipal Ferry Pier on Beijing Road, and the Shanghai Municipal Ferry Management Office has specially prepared the No. 6 new ferry for picking up and dropping off guests attending the opening ceremony. The ferry will depart from the Beijing Road pier at 9:20 AM. After the ceremony, it will return to the Beijing Road pier to transport the guests back. On that day, the fish market originally scheduled to use cars to pick up and drop off at the ferry pier from 8 AM to 11 AM. Now, it will use a special ferry, departing earlier at 9:20 AM. Guests attending should pay special attention.</p>
<p>Municipal Ferry Stops at the Fish Market</p>
<p>For the convenience of merchants, the Fish Market has specially requested the Shanghai Industrial Trust and the Municipal Ferry Management Office to have the ferries originally running between Shanghai and Songjiang-Qian stop at the Fish Market. The office has agreed and will implement it from the opening day of the market on May 11. In this way, transportation between important locations along the western bank of the Huangpu River, such as Xidu Qingning Temple, Shugou, Gaoqiao, and Wusong, and the Fish Market will be direct, which is very convenient for merchants. The ferry departure times and fares are listed below: (Fish Market to Beijing Road Pier) 5:50 AM, 6:50 AM, 7:50 AM, 8:50 AM, 10:50 AM, 12:50 PM, 2:50 PM, 4:50 PM, 5:50 PM. (Beijing Road Pier to Fish Market) 7 AM, 8 AM, 10 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, 4 PM, 5 PM. (Fish Market to Wusong) 7 AM, 8 AM, 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM, 6 PM.

<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Philippine Congressman and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Asahadi has been repeatedly welcomed by all sectors. In addition to visiting the new constructions in the city center and various domestic goods factories, he held talks on Sino-Philippine commercial relations with leaders of our business community at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the morning of the day before yesterday at 10 AM. According to Asahadi, the Philippines imports Chinese goods worth as much as 5 million pesos (Philippine gold) annually, while Philippine goods imported to China are less than 1 million pesos. The Philippines is rich in products and hopes that our Chamber of Commerce can guide all sectors to vigorously promote Sino-Philippine trade so that there is equal development between the two countries in commerce. Then, Chairman Yu Zuoting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied that the shortcoming of Philippine trade with China lies in the lack of publicity. Other countries have brokers selling grain in South China, and their prices are very low. However, China and the Philippines are like brothers. If they can connect with each other and establish a financial institution so that merchants of the two countries can use it to regulate finances and open up Sino-Philippine routes so that goods can be transported directly, it will definitely benefit the trade between the two countries greatly. Finally, Asahadi thanked Chairman Yu for his hospitality, shook hands, and departed.</p>

Subsequently, the China Remittance Bank and the Zhengming Bank joined, with their share coming from the amounts already committed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The deadline for applications has been set for today, and no further applications will be accepted. Silk manufacturers from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places have been eagerly applying for loans, and the syndicate's standing committee is reviewing and approving them on an ongoing basis.

However, due to a sharp drop in silk prices, almost all of them ceased operations. Although the number of factories commencing operations this year has increased to thirty-six, it is only about one-third of the peak number.</p>

<p>The Shiye News Agency reports that the Shanghai Chinese National Products Maintenance Association, at the request of the foreign tea merchants' association, cabled the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces on the 23rd and 25th of last month, requesting that the Red Tea Sales Committee be abolished to protect the tea industry. Yesterday, the association received a reply telegram No. 3703 from the Anhui Provincial Government, which said: "To the Wang, Zai, Zhu, and other members of the Shanghai Chinese National Products Maintenance Association: We have read your telegrams and the substitute telegrams. The improvement of red tea sales in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces is only to eliminate abuses and revive the tea industry. We have absolutely no discrimination against any party. However, the bad habit of manipulating and controlling the tea market by the foreign tea merchants in Shanghai is difficult to eradicate. Not only do they not accept the principles repeatedly communicated by the government, but they even threaten to suspend the exchange of bills, disregarding the greater good. This is deeply regrettable. The Qi, Fu, Yu, and Qu tea shops have already been registered by the Anhui-Jiangxi Sales Committee, and more than 1.95 million yuan in tea loans have been issued. The general sales office of the committee has also sent representatives to Shanghai to plan sales. This year's red tea sales will not be affected by the obstruction of a few tea merchants. If the tea merchants are indeed sincere in accepting the principles repeatedly communicated by the government, they can consult with the representatives stationed in Shanghai by the sales committee. Please investigate and advise, so as to facilitate progress. Liu Zhenhua, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "The Municipal Government's Instruction No. 17834 states that the Ministry of Industry's Consultation No. 42245 states that Article 19 of the Chamber of Commerce Law regarding the term of office of committee members also applies to industry and commerce associations. In the past, there have been delays in re-elections of merchant organizations in various places, and the Ministry has repeatedly notified the provincial and municipal governments to instruct them to re-elect within the time limit, without delay. It has been found that there are still a few chambers of commerce and industry and commerce associations that have failed to hold re-elections on schedule, which is inconsistent with the law. The local competent authorities should be responsible for investigating and supervising the process. If the re-election is still delayed, it should be handled in accordance with Article 19 of the Implementation Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law, in order to emphasize commercial operations and comply with the law. In addition to consulting, we respectfully request you to investigate and instruct compliance. We have instructed the Chamber of Commerce to comply with the provisions of the Ministry of Industry’s Commercial Letter No. 24917. Therefore, the Bureau instructs the Chamber to comply and also instruct the affiliated trade associations who have not held re-elections as scheduled to hold re-elections according to law as soon as possible, without further delay, this is of utmost importance."</p>

<p>Chen Hairong, a 38-year-old man from Yangzhou, who lives at 3620 Yinghua Lane, Shanghai West, makes a living by working. At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, he planned to leave Shanghai and return to his hometown, and was heading to the North Railway Station to board the train. He was inspected by a police officer who found nine erotic pictures on him. Because the case was related to violating police regulations, he was taken to the North Station Branch. According to Chen's confession, he had returned to his hometown earlier because of an incident, and suddenly found that the money and other items in his leather suitcase had been stolen on the ship, while the suitcase remained. He was greatly shocked. Later, a fellow passenger said that it was stolen by the iron abacus (meaning the so-called evil magic that steals property in superstitious society). If an erotic picture is placed in the suitcase, it will have an unexpected effect of suppressing and breaking the magic. Therefore, he bought several of these pictures and hid them in his suitcase, which led to his arrest. He asked for forgiveness. Officer Wu Linzhi verified the confession and, considering that Chen was carrying obscene pictures, which violated police regulations, released him with leniency after giving a reprimand.</p>

<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the crackdown on opium addiction and the registration of opium addicts in this city have been jointly proclaimed by the municipal government and the Opium Prohibition Commissioner's Office of the Military Commission, and will be implemented starting today, with the crackdown period ending on August 10th of this year. If any opium addicts are found after the deadline, they will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Crackdown Commissioner Ma Liang of the Military Commission rushed to Shanghai last night to preside over the opium prohibition work. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Proclamation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Opium Addict Registration and Opium Prohibition Crackdown Commissioner's Office of the Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality of the Military Commission jointly proclaimed that the opium prohibition crackdown in this city has been decided upon and will be implemented from May 10th to August 10th of this year. During this period, anyone who is addicted to opium who requests self-reform from the Municipal Public Security Bureau will be sent to the temporary drug rehabilitation center for treatment, and will be exempt from criminal penalties. If they continue to be stubborn and unrepentant, they will be severely punished according to the law if they are discovered. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to comply, we hereby issue a joint proclamation for general knowledge. Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Opium Prohibition Commissioner Ma Liang.</p>
<p>Ma's Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>Ma Liang, the Opium Addiction Crackdown Commissioner for Jiangsu and Shanghai Municipality, specially appointed by the Opium Prohibition Supervisory Department of the Military Commission, came to Shanghai last week to inspect the opium addiction situation in this city and, after meeting with the authorities, went to Zhen and then to Beijing to report the situation to the Opium Prohibition General Association of the Military Commission. The crackdown in Shanghai is scheduled to begin today, so Ma rushed to Shanghai last night to preside over the general crackdown on opium addict registration and opium prohibition in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Opium Prohibition Crackdown</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau announced that the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 18283 states that the Municipal Government has issued the Opium Prohibition Crackdown Measures and ordered the Municipal Government to work with the Opium Prohibition Commissioner to implement the measures. The Municipal Government has consulted with the Opium Addict Registration Commissioner and the Opium Prohibition Crackdown Commissioner's Office and decided that the opium prohibition crackdown period will be from May 10th to August 10th. During this period, anyone who is addicted to morphine, red pills, and other highly addictive drugs who reports to the Bureau and requests self-reform will be sent to the temporary drug rehabilitation center and exempted from criminal penalties. The Municipal Treasury will be responsible for all expenses, and no fees will be charged. This is the last opportunity for opium addicts to reform themselves. If they continue to be stubborn and unrepentant, they will be severely punished according to the law by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters if they are discovered after the crackdown period. It should be noted that the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Opium and Punishment of Crimes are extremely strict. All criminals who manufacture, sell, or traffic in drugs will be sentenced to death and their property confiscated. Opium addicts who do not voluntarily quit will be sentenced to imprisonment of not less than three years if they are discovered within this year, in addition to being ordered to quit. In the 26th year of the Republic, anyone who uses opium or injects morphine privately will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. The crackdown period is only three months, and it will pass quickly. All those who are addicted to drugs should go for rehabilitation as soon as possible and should not test the law with their own bodies and regret it later. This is of utmost importance. This is hereby announced. May 10, 25th year of the Republic of China. Director Cai Jingjun.</p>
<p>Opium Addiction Crackdown</p>
<p>It has been decided in this city that the period from May 10th to August 10th is the deadline for registration of opium addicts. During this period, opium addicts who have not registered are allowed to register retroactively, pay fees, and receive licenses, and will not be punished. All opium addicts who have failed to register should be awakened and take this last opportunity to register retroactively with the Bureau. If they still intend to evade and wait and see, they will still be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for punishment in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Opium and Punishment of Crimes after the crackdown period expires, without any leniency. Do not mislead yourselves again. In addition to ordering the branch bureaus and offices to comply, we are appending the procedures for retroactive registration for opium addicts during the crackdown period for general knowledge.</p>
<p>Retroactive Registration</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau has stipulated the following procedures for retroactive registration for opium addicts during the crackdown period: Registration of opium addicts will be carried out from May 10th to August 10th of this year. If registration is not completed after the deadline, punishment will be imposed in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Opium and Punishment of Crimes once it is discovered. Those who register and apply for an ordinary opium addiction cessation license must pay a license fee of 5 yuan. Those who register and apply for a poor opium addiction cessation license must pay a license fee of 6 jiao. For opium addicts who have previously failed to register, during the crackdown registration period, they should obtain a retroactive registration application form for ordinary licenses from the local Public Security Bureau and team. If they are applying for a poor license, in addition to applying for a poor license application form, they must also provide a guarantee letter, and fill in the required information separately, together with the license fee, and apply for registration. Anyone who has relatives, friends, or neighbors can act as a guarantor for the poor opium addict. There is no need for a shop to act as a guarantor. Opium addicts who have registered and obtained a license certificate must, within one month after half a month, take it to the original registration authority to exchange it for a license. Opium addicts living in the Special District may apply directly to the Bureau or to the nearby Public Security Branch Office for registration, and must clearly state their Chinese communication address in the application form. Opium addicts who apply for free opium addiction cessation during the opium addict registration period should fill out an application for opium addiction cessation and a guarantee letter, and submit them to the Bureau or each branch bureau and team, and wait for regular transfer for opium addiction cessation. If there is no guarantor, they can also apply to the branch bureau for transfer to the Bureau for transfer to opium addiction cessation. When applying for registration, opium addicts should report their true name, age, and address. If they fabricate any information, their application for retroactive registration will be rejected once the investigation confirms the falsehood.</p>
<p>Mobilization in All Districts</p>
<p>The branch bureaus and offices of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau have received instructions from the General Bureau that the opium prohibition crackdown and opium addict registration in this city will begin today. In order to make all opium addicts in the city generally understand the importance of this general crackdown and to prevent opium addicts from being negligent and committing crimes, the Bureau has ordered each branch bureau and office to organize a persuasion team and to mobilize the whole city to distribute leaflets on the procedures for retroactive registration for opium addicts during the crackdown period to each household.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Suspect Tang Zhouer, Who Assaulted a Japanese Constable, Is Under Investigation; He Could Not See the Face Clearly in the Dark; The Injury on His Middle Finger Was Said to Be a Scratch from the Rickshaw Handle <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>At 8:30 PM on the 30th of last month, a Japanese constable No. 139 from the Huishan Police Station was on duty on Huishan Road when he was suddenly dragged to a remote area by four people who looked like rickshaw pullers. Two people held him down, and one person covered his mouth with his hand, intending to snatch his gun. The Japanese constable shouted, bit the person's finger, and managed to break free. He blew his whistle and used his right hand to draw his gun for self-defense. One person stabbed him twice in the back of his hand with a knife, and his left hand was also injured by a knife. At this time, Chinese constable No. 1741 and other Japanese constables heard the alarm and arrived, and the group dispersed, losing a whistle. The Japanese constable was sent to the hospital for treatment, and his injuries were minor. He was discharged the next day. The Chinese and Western detectives of the police station conducted investigations, but could not find any clues. At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese detective Ya Yonglu received a report from Qian that Tang Zhouer, a rickshaw puller from Tongzhou living at No. 19 Huaji Road, was highly suspected. So he secretly went to the address and arrested him, confiscating a small knife and a set of muddy short-sleeved shirt and pants, and brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The engineer and lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and said that Tang had been prosecuted four times for theft and robbery, but he did not admit to the crime in the police station. Please detain him for further investigation. Detective Ya reported the process, and presented the small knife, short-sleeved shirt and pants, and a felt hat left by the group at the scene of the incident for inspection. The Japanese constable said that it was dark at the open space at that time, and he could not see the faces of the four people clearly. The arrested defendant seemed to be the person who covered his mouth with his hand. Tang Erjian did not admit it, and said that there was indeed a wound on the middle finger of his right hand, which was scratched on the rickshaw handle three days ago. The muddy short-sleeved shirt and pants were worn on rainy days. He asked for identification. Judge Jiang ordered him to be detained for further investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Last month, on the 4th, a shooting occurred in Gan County, Jiangxi Province. The deceased was named Ye Ganxiu. After investigation by the Gan County Local Court Prosecutor's Office, the identified perpetrators were Wu Zhiguang, a native of Guangdong and Ye's brother-in-law, and a man named Li Defang. Arrest warrants were issued. On April 9th, Li Defang was apprehended by the authorities. A savings passbook under the name of Wu Zhiguang at the Shanghai Juxingcheng Bank, No. 2883, was confiscated, with a balance of 850 yuan. The Gan County Prosecutor's Office immediately sent a letter to the Shanghai Juxingcheng Bank, requesting that if anyone came to inquire about or withdraw money using the passbook, they should be detained and handed over to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for custody. Upon receiving the letter, the bank instructed its staff to pay attention. The afternoon before yesterday, the principal offender in the case, Wu Zhiguang, suddenly arrived at the Juxingcheng Bank, claiming that the passbook had been lost and wanting to withdraw money. Because the bank staff did not remember the Gan County public letter, they asked Wu to leave a signature sample and to publish a declaration in the newspaper. Wu then left the bank. Wu gave his address as Room 332, Asia Hotel, 153 Avenue Edward VII. When the bank remembered, Wu had already left. The bank drafted a letter together with the public letter from the Gan County Local Court Prosecutor's Office and sent it to the General Inspectorate. Detective Li Jincheng and Western Detective Chief Tielerden rushed to Room 332 of the Asia Hotel and arrested Wu. Wu confessed that he killed [Ye Ganxiu] out of resentment because his brother-in-law, Ye Ganxiu, had colluded with the local Public Security Bureau chief to bully [Wu]. After the incident, he threw the handgun into the river. The detectives did not believe that he had thrown the handgun away. Under strict questioning, Wu confessed that the gun had not been discarded, but was wrapped in cloth and coated with red cement after the incident. The detectives searched the room and found the handgun covered in red cement and brought it back to the station. Yesterday, [Wu] was sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division One. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation and requested a ruling. Interrogated, Wu Zhiguang admitted to shooting and killing Ye Ganxiu. Judge Feng Shide verified the confession and ordered the case to be adjourned, pending notification to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office to send personnel to receive the case.</p>

<p>The case of Zhou Jinggeng, a comprador at the Xue Mai Luo Accounting Firm, who had 12,000 yuan stolen from the firm in June of the previous year, involved four people: Zhang Zuming and Zhuang Jimeng from Ningbo, Zai Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue from Taicang. The case concluded after three trials, and Zhang and the other three were declared not guilty. Now, Zhuang Jimeng has hired a lawyer to sue Zhang Zuming for false accusation, and has attached a civil suit seeking 50,000 yuan in damages. Zhang Zuming has also hired lawyer Lu Dingkui to sue Zhou Jinggeng, Gao Yushu, Feng Tiege, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, Wang Dexiang, etc., for false accusation and perjury, and has attached a civil suit seeking 50,000 yuan in damages. Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special District Court Criminal Division had opened a trial once. Because it was necessary to retrieve the files for investigation, the two cases were to be combined and heard on a scheduled date. The original date for the continuation of the trial was yesterday at 3:00 PM. Yesterday afternoon, the plaintiffs Zhuang Jimeng and Zhou Jinggeng, along with Gao, Feng, Wan, Qian, Wang, and their lawyers, Zhang Shanle, arrived at the court. However, Zhang Zuming was suffering from hemorrhoids and was being treated by Dr. Dungong Kuan at the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road and could not appear in court. He asked the doctor to issue a diagnosis certificate and appointed lawyer Lu Dingkui to appear on his behalf. After the court session began, Zhang's representative, lawyer Lu, presented the diagnosis certificate to the court, stating that Zhang Zuming was suffering from hemorrhoids and was currently receiving medical treatment and recuperating, requesting a postponement of three weeks for further trial. The court verified the report and approved the request, instructing Zhuang Jimeng, Zhou Jinggeng, etc., that since Zhang Zuming had requested a postponement due to illness, the trial could not proceed today and would be rescheduled for three weeks later. The court then adjourned. The Police Affairs Department also paid attention to the case and sent a special officer to the court to observe and record [the proceedings].</p>

They were sent to the Second Special District Court, and the Police Affairs Department lawyer requested a postponement for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the continuation of the trial in Criminal Division One. Police Affairs Department lawyer Gu Shouxi stated that the Police Affairs Department learned during the investigation that the principal offender in the case, Dou Xiguang, had taken a group of children to Xiamen to sell them. The police immediately dispatched detectives to Xiamen, requesting the local authorities to assist in the arrest. Yesterday, a telegram from the detectives stated that Dou had transferred to Yan Hai, a few dozen li from Xiamen, and they were currently rushing to investigate and arrest him. The court verified the report and instructed that the court hoped that the principal offender could be apprehended in this case, and that the trafficked children could be investigated and retrieved, so that each child could reunite with their family. There was not much relationship to the extended period. When questioned, Li Zhao admitted to kidnapping a boy and a girl each in Xizhakou, Nanshi. Jin Dianchen also admitted to kidnapping a girl on Longhua Road last year and selling her for profit. The others confessed to luring, abducting, and introducing [children] for sale.

<p>After Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo was shot and killed on Avenue Doumer on the evening of November 9th last year, the Public Concession Police Department arrested four people: Korean Jack (Chinese name Han Qiliang), and Cantonese Yang Wendao, Chen Rongsheng, and Ye Haisheng (also known as Xiao Guangdong). Jack was sent to the Japanese Consulate, Chen Rongsheng was released due to lack of evidence, and Yang and Ye were prosecuted by the Shanghai Municipal Council Legal Department on charges of murder. The First Special District Court held two public hearings on the matter, as detailed in this newspaper. The afternoon before yesterday, Ye Haisheng also confessed to the police that a Cantonese man, Zhou Sherong (also known as Yaorong, Da Zhou, Ya Zhou, 30 years old, resident of No. 13 Dade Lane, North Sichuan Road), was also present when Yang Wendao and others were discussing the assassination of Nakayama Hideo at the Tongyi Xie [Association].

According to the confession, the police arrested Zhou at the Dalu Ballroom at 11:00 PM the night before last, led by Western Detective Chief Ke Laote and Losi, and sent him to the First Special District Court Criminal Division One at 11:05 AM yesterday morning.

At that time, in addition to the two Western detectives and the deputy chief, Chinese Detective Chief Xue Zhiqian was also present. The police now need to thoroughly investigate whether Zhou is definitely related to this case, so according to Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the court is requested to approve the detention. If it is believed that Zhou definitely has criminal facts, [he] will be prosecuted together with Yang Wendao and others on the 20th of this month. And today Ye Haisheng has also brought to the case, in order to prevent repudiation, the court should first interrogate Ye, etc.. Then Western Detective Chief Ke Laote reported the circumstances of Zhou's arrest, saying that Ye had previously confessed that Zhou was present at the meeting, and confessed it again yesterday, so the police went to the Dalu Ballroom and arrested him. The court then questioned Zhou, "Do you know Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Han Qiliang?" [Zhou] answered, "I know them all." [The court] asked, "Are you a member of the Tongyi Xie [Association]?" [Zhou] answered, "Yes." [The court] asked, "Have you ever participated in discussing the assassination of a Japanese sailor?" [Zhou] answered, "I know nothing about this matter at all." The court then summoned Ye Haisheng to the witness stand. According to Ye's confession, "I have known Zhou Sherong for a long time. Zhou was also present when [we] were discussing at the Tongyi Xie [Association], and I was also called there by Zhou. The first time was on October 2nd or 3rd, Zhou went to the Yuegong Ballroom and called me to the Tongyi Xie to meet Yang Wendao and the two Koreans, one of whom was Jack. Because I had fought with Jack before, I was not happy about it. Yang knew what was on my mind and said that now that Zhou had introduced [us], [we] should get along well in the future and not argue anymore, and that many Koreans would join the association as members in the future. At the end of October, Zhou came to the Yuegong again and called me to the Tongyi Xie. I went with him. According to Yang Wendao, [we] were preparing to kill a Japanese person and asked me if I agreed. Zhou and I both expressed our agreement. A Korean said that he could prepare handguns, etc. Yang said that [we] also had them. Later, [we] went to Avenue Sayle to scout the route. On the 8th, Yang took out four paper rolls, three of which were blank, and one had the word "go" written on it. He ordered me, Zhou, and the two Koreans to each draw one. I drew a paper roll with the word "go" on it. This task was then assigned to me. Because Yang was the chairman of the association, he did not draw a roll. On the evening of the 9th, at 8:00 PM, [we] set off together. Yang was afraid that too many people would spoil things, so he instructed Zhou not to go. When [we] arrived at the Dongyang School, Yang handed me a handgun. I then proceeded to Avenue Doumer to wait. Soon, I saw Yang and others coming along behind a Japanese sailor. Yang signaled to me with his mouth, saying that the person to be killed was this person. I closely followed the sailor to near the Fengle Lane and then shot him. After the incident, I returned to the Yuegong and met Zhou. Zhou asked me how things were going. I told him that it was done. This is the beginning and end of the matter. At that time, according to Yang, the person they wanted to kill was a Japanese military officer, etc." Judge Feng immediately asked Zhou if what Ye had said was correct. Zhou shook his head repeatedly, saying that he knew nothing about this matter at all and had not participated in any discussions. He also said that he knew nothing about Ye's confession of joint agreement and drawing lots. The court asked if he had any animosity with Ye. [Zhou] answered that [they] had no animosity at all. At this point, it was 11:40 AM. Judge Feng then ordered that Zhou Sherong be detained. If the police investigation reveals no criminal suspicion by the afternoon of the 20th of this month, [he] should be released from custody in advance. The court then adjourned, and the two offenders, Ye and Zhou, were escorted back to the police station for detention by four Japanese police officers and Chinese and Western detectives.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Ningbo Natives Abroad Are Concerned About the Issue of Tomb Relocation; Letters to Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Association Urging Them to Persist in Taking Charge <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Since the various counties and towns of Ningbo Prefecture have been carrying out the demolition of tombs within a limited time, the news has spread far and wide. Ningbo natives abroad are all alarmed and at a loss. This is because Ningbo people are devoted to filial piety, and tomb sweeping during Qingming is a common practice. Once the ancestral tombs are suddenly demolished, it is appropriate for them to be heartbroken and to think of exerting all their strength to fight for it. It is heard that Ningbo natives abroad are extremely concerned about this case and have repeatedly urged the Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Association to firmly take charge. Here is a letter from the Luxun Fellow Townsmen's Association to the association, which shows a glimpse of [the situation]. The letter says, "It has been found that the various counties of our Ningbo Prefecture have recently received orders from the county government to demolish graves within a limited time. The time is urgent, and the ancestral tombs of those who are not able to return to their hometowns to handle [the matter] in time, and those who are unemployed in their hometowns and unable to relocate [the tombs] in time, are in danger of being forcibly demolished. It is also heard that in the Cixi area along the railway, the statistics of the expenses of those who own tombs and comply with the order to demolish [them] this time are about more than one million. At a time when the countryside is bankrupt and industry and commerce are declining, the necessary food and clothing expenses for people's lives are not enough, and forcing them to relocate ancestral tombs suddenly adds a burden, it is no wonder that people are resentful and complaints are heard everywhere. Recently, [we] heard that you, gentlemen of the association, are concerned about your hometown and have sent telegrams to the provincial government and President Chiang, requesting the correction of methods, the gradual implementation, the consideration of the suffering of the people, and the benevolence to the withered bones underground. Your benevolence and righteous deeds are admirable. We hope that you will persevere in taking charge and will not stop until you reach your goal. We are very fortunate, yours sincerely, the Luxun Fellow Townsmen."</p>

He used to work in the Western medicine department of the Tianli Foreign Firm on the Bund in Nanjing Road. Recently, because the firm's business was slow, there were large-scale layoffs, and Zheng was also one of those laid off. Suddenly losing his job, he was extremely frightened and uneasy and had a momentary lapse of judgment and a desire to end his life. At about 10:00 PM last night, Zheng jumped from the fourth floor of his residence, causing his left foot to be fractured and his skull to be shattered. Blood was flowing continuously. Afterwards, street patrol officer No. 1714 of the Chengdu Road police station discovered [him] and rushed [him] to the Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Pan Yaoting and his son Pan Yilan, both locals from No. 133 Lichuan Lane, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, are in the financial industry and work at the Sino-French Savings Bank. Their occupations are respectable, and their lives are affluent. Recently, Lu Shizhen, their former female servant (i.e., the eldest sister), 26 years old, from Songjiang, accused Pan Yilan of seduction and abandonment, and also implicated Pan's colleague, Wang Tianyou, in helping with intimidation and forcing her to sign a severance agreement. Yesterday at 5:15 PM, Presiding Judge Cai opened the court to hear the case. Lu Shizhen, represented by lawyers Chen Heting and Xu Lin, claimed that on February 12th of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], she was introduced by Aunt Xu to work as a servant in Pan Yaoting's home. The young master, Pan Yilan, saw that the plaintiff was young and falsely claimed that his wife had run off with another man, and wanted her to become his mistress. Pan Yaoting also testified that his daughter-in-law had left, and no one was taking care of his grandson, Little Rabbit, so he encouraged them to be together. After six or seven days, he asked an old matchmaker to propose marriage. She mistakenly believed their words and began cohabiting with him. On the sixth day of the first month of the 24th year [1935], she gave birth to a daughter named Mina, who is now two years old, and is currently three months pregnant again. On October 12th of the same year, they moved to No. 12 Jishan Lane, Zhabu Road, and lived there until December 27th, when someone brought several people to move away their belongings and tried to steal her daughter. Fortunately, the landlord helped her avoid this. Then, Wang Tianyou came to intimidate her, demanding a severance of their relationship, or she would face three and a half years of litigation. Defendant Pan Yaoting testified that he did not know about his son's affair. Lu Shizhen was temporarily out of work. The judge said that regardless of whether the criminal charges are established, since a child has been born, raising the child is just. Reconciliation is the best course of action. He asked why Pan Yilan was not present and ordered him to be brought to court for questioning next time. Pan Yaoting complied. The judge also questioned Wang Tianyou, and ordered him to be summoned again later.</p>

<p>Zheng Rongting, 30 years old, a local resident of No. 1 Fangxie Lane, Fangxie Road, Nanshi, runs a foreign goods business. Because he has a spare attic room, he put it up for rent. At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, two men wearing blue cloth long gowns and short jackets, speaking in a local accent, knocked on the door and entered, pretending to rent the room. They agreed to rent the attic room for seven yuan per month and paid a deposit of one yuan, saying that they would come tomorrow to wallpaper the room. After speaking, they left. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:30 PM, two men indeed came carrying a roll of patterned paper and went upstairs to wallpaper. Soon, one person went out to buy more paper and came back. Seeing that there was only an old woman (i.e., Zheng Rongting's mother-in-law), Ms. Wang, doing needlework in the living room, the thief took out a gun from his sleeve, threatened her to keep silent, and forced Ms. Wang to hand over her jewelry. Ms. Wang shouted, "Catch the thief!" At the same time, a thief upstairs also came downstairs. Seeing that the old woman was shouting, the thieves pushed Ms. Wang to the ground in a panic and fled. The patrol police nearby heard the shout and reported to the Ximen Branch Bureau. Bureau officer Huang Tizhi led a large number of police detectives to pursue the thieves. The thieves, unable to rob, dropped a fake gun and escaped through the back door without a trace.</p>

<h3 id="e143">China First Knitting Factory Investigates Counterfeit Trademarks; Four Criminals Have Been Detained in Succession; Handed Over to the General Bureau for Investigation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai China First Knitting Factory, located at Zhongtai'an Lane, the intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road, has been established for many years. The factory's Ink Chrysanthemum brand socks are sold in various ports, and the business is booming. Recently, counterfeit products have been found on the market, and dealers from other ports have sent letters suspecting the factory of mixing inferior goods, which has greatly affected the business. The factory owner sent people to investigate. Yesterday afternoon, it was learned that the Xincheng Printing Bureau at No. 8 Ningkang Lane, Anlan Road, Ximen, specializes in printing counterfeit trademarks. They went to investigate and found seven counterfeit printing plates inside. They arrested a shop assistant, Yang Boliang, and took him and the printing plates to the Ximen Branch Bureau, accusing the bureau of printing counterfeit trademarks for use on inferior socks to impersonate the products of the China First Knitting Factory, deceiving customers who came to question them. Bureau Chief Huang interrogated Yang, who claimed that the printing of the counterfeit trademarks was arranged by the boss, Jin Zupei. He was evasive about the rest. Later, the detective squad leader Li Xiaoshi sent personnel to secretly arrest Jin and confiscated 100,500 printed counterfeit trademarks. It was learned that the counterfeit trademarks were commissioned by Yang Ruijin of the Xinhua Printing Office at No. 99 Siwen Lane, Xinzha. Yang was arrested. Yang confessed that he was instructed by Li Zaixian, a Shanxi native of the Li Yu National Goods Store at No. 27 Shengping Lane, Avenue Edward VII. The team sent Jin Yushan and Chen Minsheng, along with the French Concession Police, to search the Li Yu Store and seized hundreds of counterfeit trademarks and four pairs of white socks mixed with inferior goods, pretending to be Ink Chrysanthemum brand. Li Zaixian was arrested. The interrogation involved many people. Because the case involved counterfeiting trademarks, the four arrested criminals and more than 100,000 counterfeit trademarks were transferred to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>The Dagong Society, the Qingliang Temple on Xinzha Road, is a famous temple in Shanghai. Recently, due to land disputes, litigation has been ongoing for years.

Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Zhu Qinglan, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinrong, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Cai Jinjun, etc., in order to respect religion and protect the temple, have repeatedly held discussions to maintain it and have received assistance from various parties. However, due to the lack of a fixed organization, progress has been inconvenient. Therefore, they have solicited support from all sectors to jointly launch the "Shanghai Qingliang Temple Maintenance Association" with the aim of settling disputes peacefully, resolving difficulties, eliminating obstacles to understanding with affection, and complementing the shortcomings of the law with public opinion, so that both parties can achieve fairness and success will not be quickly destroyed. The Maintenance Association convened an inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday on the ninth floor of the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge, announcing its official establishment. More than 100 people attended, including Huang Jinrong, Zhu Qinglan, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Yiting, Wu Tiecheng, Li Dachao, Jiang Kanghu, Qu Yingguang, Yang Hu (Wang Ji-yi representing him), etc. The meeting passed five articles of association: 1. The association is named the Shanghai Qingliang Temple Maintenance Association. 2. The association is solely responsible for mediation and relief in the Qingliang Temple litigation, with the aim of maintaining the existence of the temple. 3. The association is launched by the Qingliang Temple's benefactors and patrons over the years. Anyone who expresses sympathy for this matter can join as a member. 4. Members of the association will elect officials, who will fulfill their obligations without remuneration. 5. The association will elect several standing committee members to preside over the affairs of the association. Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Shichang, Li Dachao, Qu Yingguang, Jiang Kanghu, Yang Shunquan, Li Binsen, Yuan Xi tao, Wang Ji-yi, Xin Shude, Chen Fukang, Cao Mingwei, Lu Qi, and Zhang Xuxian were elected as standing committee members on the spot.

To request an extension of the deadline for the execution of the land mortgage; 2. To assess the land price, raise funds, and find a way to recover it. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>Central Bank Intervention Calms Market; Scattered Short Positions Gradually Increase</p>
<p>The gold market was initially affected by the continued rise in exchange rates and the strengthening of the US dollar. Large speculators, seeing the unfavorable environment, actively bought, causing prices to rise. In the morning, it was said that overseas silver markets in the UK and the US were flat. Traders predicted that after the market closed, there would be sellers at listed prices, while buyers would be below the listed price of 0.0625. The forward silver price in Monterey remained unchanged. Exchange rates continued to rise, and the price of raw gold in London fell by three pence. Off-exchange trading opened at 32.5 to 33 yuan. Dadecheng, Fuxing, Yongfutai, Yongyuanmao, and Yonghuixiang sold, but prices retreated to 31.5 yuan. Chunyuan Yong and others took advantage of the low prices to buy, stabilizing the market slightly. When the Central Bank announced its exchange rates, the UK and the US were flat, and the customs gold unit fell by 0.04 yuan. The standard gold premium was listed at 1142.2 yuan, and the market officially opened. There was much fluctuation after the opening. Later, because of the closing of positions by many parties such as Huixiang, Yicheng, Dingkang, Fuxing, and Yong, and the increased short selling by Yuanmao Yong, the 30 yuan mark was broken. The US exchange rate also eased, falling to a low of 28.5 yuan. It was rumored that the Central Bank intervened with 700 gold bars at a price of 29 yuan, which boosted the buying sentiment of large speculators. The price gradually rose above 30 yuan, and the market stabilized. However, due to the occasional pressure from the short side, there were many fluctuations despite the rise. At noon, the trend was hovering. The total number of chips currently is estimated to be over 14,000 bars, with the short side exceeding the long side by five firms. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The market opened at 1131.9 yuan, a drop of 1.7 yuan from the previous close. Chunyuan Yongfu Da advanced to 2 yuan, while Yicheng Fuxing Yong sold at 1.5 yuan.

Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong Yicheng Wuchangxiang Chunyuan Yong Dingkang Huixiang Qianchangxiang Tongfeng Heng Fuxing Yong all sold, breaking the 30 yuan mark, falling to 28.5 yuan. Qiafeng Yong Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Shengyuan Yong Tongtaichang Qingfa Yong Fuyu all advanced on the low price, rising to 30 yuan. Fuxing Yong Hengyu Yuxinxiang Qianchangxiang Shang sold, retreating to 29.6 yuan. The announcement of the silver balancing tax did not move the market, and it fluctuated. Futai Yong Yicheng Chunyuan Yong Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Futai Heng Yuanchang Yong all advanced, rising to 32.1 yuan. Yuanmao Yong Huixiang tried to sell, falling to 0.6 yuan. Futai Heng Futai Yong Fuxing Yong Hengchang Yong bought, and the price rose to 31.6 yuan. Hengyu Dingkang took advantage of the high price to sell at 30.7 yuan. Chunyuan Yong Futai Heng Huixiang Yuantai Yuqing Yong all advanced, rising to 32.3 yuan. Daheng and retail investors sold slightly, retreating to 31.5 yuan. Fuxing Yong Shenfeng advanced again, rising to 32.3 yuan. Dafa Yong Dingkang divested, dropping to 31.5 yuan. The market closed at noon at 1131.6 yuan. After the market closed, Yuqing Yong and others still bought, and the price was relatively hidden.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on the Central Bank's standard gold premium price, which was listed at 1142.6 yuan. The closing price was about 11 yuan weaker, unchanged from the previous close. The registered price for this month was 1127 yuan, and for June, it was 1132 yuan. The morning water charge was 1127 yuan, and the price of pure gold was 1136.9 yuan, plus 5 yuan. The spot market was calm. Tianjin goods were plus 12 yuan, and cooked pure gold was plus 12 yuan, but there were no transactions. Because of the lower gold premium, the water charge seemed to be rising. No swap transactions were heard.</p>
<p>In the trading floor, demand exceeded supply. Futai Heng Qingfa Yong Hengyu Shengyuan Yong Tongtai Chang Yuanchang Yong Futai Yong Chunyuan Yong Hengchang Yong Fuyu Qiafeng Yong Wanxing Shunli and others were on the buying side. Yuanmao Yong Yicheng Fang, Hengchang Yong Fuxing Yong initially sold, then bought. Daheng Hengyu initially bought, then sold.</p>
<p>The market situation for the first half of the day was initially weak, then stabilized. The market opened at 1131.9 yuan and closed at noon at 1131.6 yuan. The highest price was 1132.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 1128.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 3.8 yuan. The result was a drop of 2 yuan compared to the previous close. The total number of transactions in the first half of the day was 14,230 bars.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Overseas Exchange Rates Rise Again; Local Exchange Market Shows Tight Sterling and Loose US Dollar <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Continue to Sell</p>
<p>The exchange market was tense yesterday due to the rise in exchange rates and the weakness of the US dollar. Chinese merchants closed positions, resulting in tight Sterling and stronger US Dollar. In the morning, overseas telegrams reported that large Sterling transactions in London were flat in both near and far terms. Traders predicted that there would be sellers at listed prices after the market closed, while buyers would be lower by 0.0625. The New York silver market was unchanged. The forward silver price in Monterey remained unchanged. The price of raw gold in London fell by three pence. Sterling rose by 1.375 against the US Dollar, and by 22 points against the French Franc. The US Dollar rose by 0.02 against Sterling and fell by 1.25 against the French Franc. The Central Bank's announced exchange rates showed Sterling and US Dollar flat. The customs gold unit fell by 0.04 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of Sterling at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4.4375, and US Dollar at 30 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Sterling was tighter by 0.03125, and US Dollar was looser by 0.0625. After the opening, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to close positions. HSBC Bank announced flat Sterling and US Dollar rates, but the selling appetite of Chinese merchants was slightly strong, making the process difficult to be optimistic about. The silver balancing tax announcement was unchanged. The situation gradually stabilized. Banks continued to maintain the rates, and the British-American Tobacco Company showed an appetite for closing Sterling positions, so the overall trend was flat. Finally, banks and foreign firms swapped Sterling exchange rates, making the process even more mediocre. The recent selling price at the noon close was Sterling at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4.4375, and US Dollar at 30 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Sterling was tighter by 0.03125, and US Dollar was looser by 0.0625. The forward rate was flat for Sterling and 0.125 weaker for the US Dollar. Chinese merchants sold approximately 200,000 US Dollars. The British-American Tobacco Company settled and bought Sterling. The transactions for the first half of the day are recorded below:</p>

<p>The yarn market, which had been falling sharply for several days, stabilized slightly yesterday, but market discussions still pointed to a decline, and sentiment remained volatile. The long side still appeared cautious, so the market was easily affected by selling but difficult to rise. However, prices have fallen by 12-13 yuan from their peak, and some have taken a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Rises in Distant Months, Falls in Near Months</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures yarn market, each month showed signs of sluggishness, and trading was not active. Each month rose by 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 yuan. Unexpectedly, the declining wind started again at the second session, and sellers frequently exerted pressure, causing panic. However, most long positions had been closed out clearly the previous day, and sellers were not as eager as the previous day. Therefore, although the decline in near months was severe, the distant months showed stability. As a result, the near months fell by an average of 0.06 and 0.09 yuan from the previous day's closing price, and the October rate rose by 0.01 yuan. At the opening of the afternoon session, there were not many sellers, but buyers were lacking new long positions due to the poor environment. However, the extent of short selling had been reduced, with the price falling by 13-14 yuan from the high price. As a result, the situation stabilized. As a result, each month rose by an average of 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The sellers included Deda with 2750 bales, Daji with 1150 bales, Dafeng with 1250 bales, Daji with 1100 bales, Runkang with 800 bales, Shenji with 2600 bales, Taichang with 1900 bales, Yichang with 1310 bales, Runkang with 800 bales, and Jinghua with 950 bales. The buyers included Dafu with 1150 bales, Meiji with 750 bales, Mingde with 750 bales, Hexing with 500 bales, Renfeng with 1850 bales, Changfeng with 1250 bales, Shengyuan with 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Less Than 500 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn were flat. Statistics showed that various guilds purchased a total of 485 bales for the whole day, and the selling price fell by 0.05 yuan. The purchase amount of each guild is listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e189">Short Covering and Short Selling Occur Simultaneously, Cotton Prices Fall and Rebound <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market showed a rebound after the decline, and the trend stabilized slightly. The main reason was that the continuous large decline caused some profitable parties to cover their short positions. One of the main figures on a certain side was still increasing his long positions, but most gold merchants had closed their positions clearly and things may calm down temporarily. However, the demand for spot cotton is not smooth.</p>
<p>Huge Amount of Futures Cotton Pulled In</p>
<p>At the opening of the futures cotton market, the human sentiment in the market was calm, and the table price was slightly high due to mixed fluctuations in US cotton prices, up and down by 2-6 pounds, up in Indian cotton prices by 0.5-1.25 rupees, and down in Osaka Sanpin cotton prices by 0.02-0.03 yuan. Each month rose by 0.015-0.02 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the opening of the second session, the selling wind was particularly strong, and the downward trend was severe because gold merchants continued to close out their long positions. The sellers took advantage of the situation to exert pressure, and each month fell sharply by 0.03-0.04 yuan. The three closing disks turned calm again. As a result, the prices in each month increased or decreased by 0.01 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon market, some long parties pulled in, and the momentum was slightly high. Hexing Runkang bought in large quantities, and Yikang also covered significantly. The chips on the table tightened. As a result, the prices in each month rose by 0.015 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Changhe Wan sold 11,000 dan, Yuanxingchang sold 3,900 dan, Xinchang sold 1,600 dan, Xincheng sold 3,100 dan, Taichang sold 2,500 dan, Dachangcheng sold 3,200 dan, Senkang sold 3,500 dan, Zhenda sold 2,400 dan, Mingde sold 7,200 dan, Dafeng sold 6,000 dan, Deda sold 4,500 dan, Shengyuan sold 2,000 dan. Runkang bought 10,200 dan, Yikang bought 6,500 dan, Yuanyi bought 3,500 dan, Renfeng bought 2,000 dan, Shenchang bought 3,200 dan, Changji bought 2,400 dan, Minghua bought 4,200 dan, Hexing bought 8,000 dan, Dafu bought 3,500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Flat</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton was mediocre, and the factory conditions were unhealthy. The source of Yao arrived 855 bales, and Tonghua arrived 36 bales.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Heavy Import of Foreign Cotton <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>According to sources, 53,000 bales of Indian cotton arrived in April, and another 50,000 bales are expected to arrive in mid-May. There are also many arrivals of American cotton, creating significant pressure from foreign cotton. This is something that must be carefully considered. Regarding the supply and demand of cotton in this city, due to the government's implementation of cotton improvement policies, imports of foreign cotton have gradually decreased since 1930. Last year, imports of American and Indian cotton were only a fraction of what they used to be, indicating that self-sufficiency may be achieved soon. This year, foreign cotton speculators have increased their purchases compared to last year. The pressure from these imported cottons will further depress the market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with gains of 4 points and losses of 2 points across different months. Early in the morning, domestic traders bought old cotton, and foreign firms also made purchases, strengthening the market. However, cotton farmers then started selling aggressively, causing long positions to close. There was rain in Oklahoma and Texas, and the wheat market was weak, leading to a price decline. Domestic traders covered their May positions, while stockpilers sold at 11.57 cents. Subsequently, domestic traders bought July positions, while external demand was quiet and current demand sluggish. Spot prices rose by 2 points, while futures rose by 2 points to fall by 5 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 2 points, while futures fell by 12 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to short covering but weakened due to unfavorable Liverpool news. Bengal rose by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Oomra rose by 0.50 to 0.75 rupee, and Broach rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees. (Reported by telegram on the 8th)</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Broach cotton for July/August delivery on the 9th was 190 rupees, down by half a rupee from the previous day.</p>

<p>—Only Gray Fabric Business Gradually Increases—</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market is very sluggish due to weak actual sales and the adverse effects of yarn and cotton prices. The reason for this is that smuggling of cloth from South China and North China has blocked the sales of Shanghai cloth, which is a major key. Both white and colored goods are overstocked and there is a risk of surplus. Yesterday, customers from Wuhu and Anqing in Anhui Province, as well as Wenzhou and Taizhou in Zhejiang Province, purchased slightly over a hundred pieces of colored and fine cloth. Sales of dyed cloth were slightly better, and the gray fabric business gradually increased. Yesterday, local dyeing factories continued to purchase 100 bales of Yufeng 12-pound Longtou fine cloth for this month, at a price of 6.85 yuan per piece. The Nanyang Company purchased over 60 pieces of Donghuo 13-pound Yiniu Tou coarse cloth, 11-pound blue and white fine cloth, and 10-pound Tiaowu market cloth.</p>

<p>Overseas silk prices are improving daily, and the market is entering a normal trading pattern. Furthermore, European and American silk weaving factories are about to start production, and the demand for raw materials is gradually increasing. Therefore, yesterday, foreign firms in the local silk market resumed active trading. White silk of 13-22 strands, foreign re-reeled silk, and futures trading for June/July delivery were the most popular. Prices generally rose slightly. The total transaction volume was 180 bales (details in the Market Conditions section). Moreover, Shanghai sent out many silk telegrams yesterday, approximately 500-600 bales. It is understood that the prices offered by manufacturers are 800 yuan for 11-13 strands of white silk, 760 yuan for 13-15 strands, 650 yuan for 20-22 strands, and 680 yuan for 20-22 strands of foreign re-reeled silk. These prices are not far from overseas prices, so it is expected that the silk market may be even smoother next week.</p>

<p>This year, new Wuyuan tea was harvested one week earlier than usual due to the advice of various mountain households. Currently, harvesting in the eastern areas of Xitou, Longwei, Shangtan, and Xiaoqi is nearing completion. The tea picking work in the northern areas will also be finished soon. The products are very tender, and the amount of old and coarse tea has been greatly reduced compared to previous years. In terms of quantity, general merchants estimate that there are only 42,000-43,000 boxes. However, only a few tea shops, such as Shenyuan, Shengchang, and Sheng, are open to lending funds for the tea trade in this area, while most others remain cautious. Judging from the current situation, it is hoped that the opening price of new tea will increase.</p>

More than 130 boxes of new Chunmee samples displayed by various tea shops were all purchased by companies such as Xiehe, Tongfu, Baochang, and Hua Tea. Local Zhuang-grade hand-picked tea opened at 105 yuan, while ordinary Zhuang-grade tea opened at 93 yuan, with prices trending firm. It is said that a large batch of new goods will be launched next Monday.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market opened lower and continued to decline. The weather was good all day, and people in the interior generally expected a small harvest. Moreover, foreign wheat prices were reported to be 30-40 cents lower, and outside stockpilers were also wavering, prompting aggressive short covering. Selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon, causing the market to fall further. Closing prices were down 4-5 cents for both near and distant months. Spot wheat was dragged down by the standard wheat, also down 5 cents yesterday. The total volume cleared by factories was over 4,000 bags, with Shandong wheat opening at only 5 yuan and Tongzhou wheat at only 4.87 yuan.</p>
<p>In the American wheat market, heavy rain in the Southwest, unprecedented this year, is expected to continue. Many long positions were closed, and both factory and external markets were weak, with prices likely to continue falling.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various gangs was scarcer than before, with only over ten boats arriving (a total of over 2,000 piculs). However, retail sales were even more limited, causing the market to appear weak. The price of thick early japonica rice was slightly reduced, while 500-600 bags of thin indica rice from the Qingdao gang were stable with a softening trend. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan were both mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-one or twenty-two boats of Hexia rice arrived. Various types of high-quality japonica rice were still flat, and prices showed a softening trend. Thin indica high-quality rice moved slightly, while medium-quality rice was sluggish. The market shape was tight for high-quality goods at close to the corner price, while medium-quality goods were stable. Retail sales of Bai Yuan were quite active, while Jinan gang Qiaogiao moved slightly, with prices tightly rising. Yin Yuan was stable, Yangjian was slightly weak, and the prices of other goods also showed a softening trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice was not robust, but the inventory in the market was still plentiful, and merchants and stockpilers held a lot of rice. Because prolonged storage is not advisable and holding on is useless, they planned to lower prices to sell. Retail sales were still weak, and although there were some inquiries about inland machine-milled rice and rough Xian rice, the transactions were limited and the prices were even tighter. The market was stable, and the prices were lower than the previous session. The total volume in this street was 1,000 bags of the city's own rice, 80 bags of Taiwanese rice, 50 bags of broken rice, and 827 bags of inland rice, totaling less than 2,000 bags.</p>

<h3 id="e202">A Word to the Nation's Children on Purchasing Aircraft to Celebrate a Birthday <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yongyu, Student of Minsheng Elementary School</p>
<p>"Aviation to save the nation" is a resounding slogan. Although the results are not bad, they are still not entirely satisfactory. My dear children, you have probably seen the news in the newspapers about purchasing aircraft to celebrate a birthday, haven't you? It is Premier Chiang's 50th birthday this year, and the people of the nation have the heroic act of purchasing aircraft to celebrate his birthday. This matter is very relevant to national defense. The ancients said that the rise and fall of a nation is the responsibility of every citizen. Although we are young, we are all members of the Republic of China. We should all get up and save money on sweets and snacks to contribute to this grand event. In major cities, many children spend more than one yuan on sweets every month. I believe that if every child in the nation donates two cents of sweets money each month, it won't be a big deal. However, many grains form a tower, and many bits of fur make a robe. If there are 50 million children in the nation, and each donates two cents per month, we can get one million yuan per month, which can be used to purchase ten aircraft. In one year, we can get over a hundred aircraft. If you save two cents of sweets money each month, it won't hurt you at all. However, by working together, the country will benefit greatly. Children, let's all get up and do it!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Student Self-Government Movement in Elementary Schools <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuying</p>
<p>Recently, I read a publication from an American elementary school, which included an article about the self-governing life of elementary school students in that school. The United States is a democratic country with a highly developed democracy, and the people are all capable of self-government. In fact, in the United States, not only adults are capable of self-government, but we can also see from this record that American children are also capable of self-government. Indeed, only when there are children who can govern themselves can there be adults who are good at governing themselves. I think that the descriptions in this record are worthy of introduction to my country's children, so I have extracted and translated a few sections below.</p>
<p>Reading Club—The school's library is entirely managed by students. Under the library system, there are three reading clubs, divided into groups A, B, and C. These three groups are divided according to the level of their studies. The expression of their reading achievements is a meeting every two or three weeks. At the meeting, those who have gained insights from reading can go on stage and make a ten-minute report, which is judged by eleven pre-selected judges (students from different groups), each giving a separate score. At the end of the semester, the scores are tallied, and the person with the most points is ranked first. Another method is to take notes. At the end of the semester, the notes are evaluated by publicly elected judges. The names of the top two students in each group are entered in a special "Model Reader's List" book, which is permanently preserved in the library.</p>
<p>Athletic Association—This association is also entirely organized by students. Under the athletic association system, there are hiking teams, ball teams, calisthenics teams, and health and hygiene patrol teams. These small organizations require further explanation. The hiking team aims to collect specimens, held three times each semester, always on weekends. The ball team is mainly football, with two teams organized in each grade. One team is drawn from the two teams to form a grade team to play inter-grade matches. Every weekend, there are at least two matches. Health is measured by physical improvement and chest expansion. Checked once a month.</p>
<p>Service Club—This is a Boy Scout organization. But the scope of their service is very broad. In addition to the ordinary services in the corps, they are also responsible for monitoring the actions of their classmates. If they see a classmate doing something immoral and do not advise or report it, they will be severely punished once exposed. But those who have excellent grades or special achievements will also have their names inscribed in a "Model Scout List" book that will be permanently preserved.</p>
<p>I think that the children of our country should also organize these three items on their own, govern themselves automatically, and train to become good citizens of the future.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Thermos <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>

<p>One Sunday, Miner's father bought a thermos from the market. Miner saw the words "Keeps hot for 24 hours, keeps cold for 48 hours" written on the bottle. He was very surprised to see the seven words "Keeps hot for 24 hours" and asked:</p>
<p>"Dad, how can this thermos keep hot for 24 hours?" "What is it made of inside? Can you take it apart and show me?"</p>
<p>His father took the bottle apart and saw a snow-white small bottle. He said:</p>
<p>"Miner, look, this small bottle is made of double-layered glass, and the wall of the bottle is silver-plated. Because the bottle is double-layered, the air between the two layers is completely extracted to create a vacuum. Why vacuum? I'll tell you in a minute." Then his father took off his hat, took a sip of tea, and said: "As for how it can keep hot, there are some small reasons. Let me start from the beginning to make you understand better: When it comes to heat, there are three ways to transfer heat: Conduction: If you take an iron rod and put one end of the iron rod in the fire, after a while, the end you are holding will feel hot. This is called heat conduction. Convection: Liquids and gases rise when heated, and the cold parts fall, which is called heat convection. Radiation: After the above two methods, if there is no third method, there will be a big problem. If you see a light bulb when it is on, we can touch the light bulb and feel very hot. What is this reason? We know that the light bulb is empty, and there is no convection effect. It is not connected to the filament, so there is no conduction effect, which is the third way to transfer heat.</p>
<p>"As for how the thermos can keep hot for 24 hours? Because it avoids the three ways of heat transfer: The small bottle in the thermos is alone in the center and does not connect with anything, so there is no conduction effect. It is a double-layer wall, and the air in the wall is extracted, which can prevent heat convection. The wall is plated with silver, and when radiant heat touches it, it is reflected back. So with these three methods, hot water or ice water can be kept at its original cold or hot temperature in the bottle."</p>
<p>"Dad, what is the use of the pointed head at the bottom?"</p>
<p>"Because the air between the walls has to be extracted, and after the air is extracted, it is plugged here."</p>
<p>Little Science Problems</p>
<h3 id="e205">Why Don't Birds Get Electrocuted When They Sit on Power Lines? <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>As long as we pay a little attention when running on the road, we can see many birds hiding on the power lines, chirping and singing freely. It's strange that people get electrocuted when they touch the power lines, but birds don't get electrocuted when they hide on the power lines? To understand this principle, we should first know how we get electrocuted? We can observe from electric lights, electric stoves, and other electrical things that there are always two wires connected behind them. In other words, any electrical effect must have two wires connected at the same time. Electricity originally has the distinction between positive electricity and negative electricity or positive electricity and negative electricity. When there is an electrical effect, both of these types must be connected. Having only positive electricity is not enough, and having only negative electricity is not enough. Electrocution is also a type of electrical effect, so naturally it also requires two types of electricity. The reason why birds don't get electrocuted when they sit on power lines is because they only sit on one line. If they touch two wires, naturally we can't guarantee that they won't be in danger. However, in reverse: Why do we people sometimes get electrocuted when we touch one wire? The reason is very simple: Because although one hand only touches one wire, the two feet are on the ground, and there is another wire on the ground that people can't see. With two wires, you will naturally get electrocuted. However, we can avoid this danger by wearing a pair of rubber shoes.</p>

<p>— Ziding</p>
<p>This is a very fun toy that you can make and play with using a piece of cardboard.</p>
<p>First, you draw the simple drawing A below—a person riding a horse on paper. You see that although the horse in the picture only has two legs and the rider only has one arm, the moving horse legs and human arm need to be added. You color picture A, stick it on the cardboard, and cut it out. Second, draw the added two horse legs and a whip-holding human arm as shown in Figure B, color them, stick them on the cardboard, and cut them out.</p>
<p>Third, put the cut-out picture A upside down on the table, and place the added horse legs in a proper position to create a running posture. At the same time, put the rider's arm holding the whip in place. To do this, you need a pushing rod. This rod is very important. You must use it to make the horse and man move. What is the material for making this rod? You can use a strip of cardboard, but it is best to use "a thin piece of wood, which is more durable. After drilling holes in the aligned horse legs and human arm and connecting them with a thread, drill two small holes above the tightly joined horse legs, place the rod horizontally, align it with the two small holes, drill two small holes in the rod, and connect them with a thread. Finally, make a gap in the center of the rod to accommodate the whip. The toy can be considered successful at this point, as shown in Figure C.</p>
<p>Turning Figure C over is Figure D. When playing, you only need to push the rod on the toy back and forth to see the horse running very fast, and the rider's arm is also moving very lively, just like a real person. Children, this toy is very good. In your spare time, you can try making it.</p>
<h3 id="e208">What Do Lions, Tigers, and Elephants Eat in the Circus? <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Guowei</p>
<p>Yesterday, Miner went to see the circus with his father. After the show, Miner asked his father, "Dad, what do the tigers, lions, elephants, etc. that do circus tricks eat every day?" After listening to Miner's question, his father thought for a while and replied, "I don't understand very well myself. Let's go ask." They went to a circus staff member and politely asked, "Sir, would you be willing to tell us what these wild animals eat?" The staff member listened and replied politely, "I am very willing, very willing. If you don't mind the tediousness, let me slowly tell you. A normal middle-aged lion needs to eat 30 to 40 catties of beef every day, and tigers are about the same. Elephants are gluttonous. They eat 55 catties of buckwheat, chaff, sweet potatoes, radishes, bananas, etc. a day. And elephants also like to drink very much. They can drink forty or fifty bottles of beer without getting drunk. When the weather is cold, each elephant drinks a bottle of whiskey (a very strong wine) to keep warm. Do you think that's amazing? There are also monkeys of all sizes, who also have to eat a meal and two teas every day. A lot of milk and sugar are added to the tea, and the meal is made of fruits and vegetables. On average, we spend a total of three hundred yuan every day to provide their food."</p>
<p>After listening to the staff member's words, Miner's father and Miner thanked him respectfully and went home happily.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Whales and Fish <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Little Shrimp</p>
<p>A whale is a mammal with a huge body, six or seven zhang long. Because it lives in the water, everyone calls it "whale fish." Because it is called "whale fish," some people think that it must also be a fish, just like ordinary fish. But it's not. A whale is a whale and a fish is a fish.</p>
<p>The body of a whale is ten million times larger than that of a fish; the body of a fish is covered with scales, while the body of a whale has nothing; the blood of a whale is warm, while the blood of a fish is cold; a whale is born alive, while a fish is born from eggs; a whale breathes with lungs, and a fish breathes with gills. The most obvious thing besides the whale's extremely large body is their two tails. When drawing whales, most people draw their tails like fish, which is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Why? The tail shape of a whale is flat and round, while the tail shape of a fish is flat and straight (see the top circle). However, most people often have wrong ideas, so such jokes are made! Here, I attach two tail diagrams to correct the mistakes that children have made before.</p>
<h3 id="e210">What Kind of Person Will I Be in the Future <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhen, Grade 4, No. 1 Elementary School in Hankou City</p>
<p>(14th Place)</p>
<p>Our country is now very weak and oppressed by powerful enemies, and cannot be revived. We are all young children and should not shout empty slogans of saving the country. Everyone should have a firm ambition: "What kind of person will I be in the future to save the country?"</p>
<p>What is my ambition? It is to be a doctor with scientific research! Now I write the reason for my ambition below:</p>
<p>First, because doctors in our country now generally do not have scientific research methods to improve; what's more, some have no knowledge at all, read a few medical books, and come to be doctors, diagnosing and treating inexplicably. Therefore, many people have suffered from them; weren't my aunt and grandfather both killed by taking the wrong medicine? Therefore, I must use scientific research methods to improve Chinese medicine in the future!</p>
<p>Second, because being a doctor is beneficial to the country. In addition to being able to diagnose and treat patients and save the lives of many compatriots, if we start a war with the enemy, we doctors can also go to the front line to rescue the wounded soldiers who are fighting for the country. Isn't this of great help to the country?</p>
<p>Third, because doctors now only know how to make money and do not help the poor at all! So that many poor compatriots cannot be cured and die! This is really too bad! Therefore, I will definitely help the poor and be a life-saving doctor in the future.</p>
<p>For these three reasons: to improve Chinese medicine, to rescue front-line soldiers, and to help the poor, my ambition is determined to be a doctor with scientific research! Save the Chinese nation—and save all mankind!</p>

<p>Fei Jian opened the box and saw it was full of things. He was extremely happy and wanted to move it to the ground to eat it all by himself.</p>
<p>Rong'er realized that his box had been stolen by Fei'er, so he quietly put the small net on the ground next to Fei'er. Fei'er moved everything out of the box and placed it on the ground. He didn't know that they had all been placed into Rong'er's small net.</p>
<p>Rong'er knew that everything in the box was in the small net, and immediately carried it on his shoulders and left: "Ha! Ha! So many things still belong to me!"</p>

<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>This kind of work was very hard for Bosui Xi. Over these several years, Xiao Nanluo gradually became a strong young man, while it aged year by year. Its legs had become stiff, and its bones often ached, yet it still refused to slacken in the work it should do. Xiao Nanluo very much wanted it to save some energy and pull the cart himself, but how could Bode Xi agree? The only help it could accept was a push from Xiao Nanluo from behind whenever it got stuck in icy ruts. But Bode Xi was used to the work of pulling the cart all its life, and it felt very proud of itself. Although it endured the torment of ice and frost, the bumps of the road, and the soreness of its muscles and bones, it held its breath, lowered its head, and continued forward relentlessly.</p>
<p>Nanluo had repeatedly said to his beloved dog, "Bode Xi, take a rest at home. At your age, it's time to rest. I can pull the cart myself." But even though Bode Xi understood his good intentions, it never wanted to stay put. Putting its body between the two cart shafts and walking step by step in the snow, its footprints had been constantly imprinted there for the past several years.</p>
<p>Bode Xi thought to itself, "No one should rest unless they are dead." Yet it also felt that the time for it to rest seemed not far off. Its eyesight was no longer as clear as before, and it felt pain in its back when it got up after a night's sleep. However, every time it heard the bells of the temple strike five, it knew that day had broken and work should begin, and it would never lie in the straw pile again.</p>
<p>The old gentleman often reached out his withered hand to stroke Bode Xi's head, saying, "Poor Bode Xi, you and I will soon be quietly lying together." At that time, the old man's heart and the old dog's heart held the same thought and the same sorrow, wondering who would take care of their beloved Xiao Nanluo after they both passed away.</p>
<p>One afternoon, they returned from Ang'er through the snow. The plains were covered in thick snow, which had frozen solid and smooth, like marble. As they walked along, they suddenly found a beautiful little wooden doll lying on the road, playing a small drum. It was six inches tall, wearing red and vermilion clothes, and when they picked it up, it was not damaged at all. It was indeed a very beautiful toy. Xiao Nanluo wanted to find its owner, but he couldn't find them. He secretly thought that this thing would be very suitable to give to Xiao Ai Luo, who would definitely be happy to see it.</p>
<p>It was already night when he passed the mill. He knew that was where Xiao Ai Luo's room was, with its small window. He thought that since the two of them often played together, there would be no harm in giving her this little thing.</p>
<p>Below her room, there was a small shed. He climbed onto the sloping shed roof and gently knocked on the windowpane a few times, only to see that there was a light on inside. Xiao Ai Luo opened the window and looked out, showing some surprise.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Critique of Kant's Agnosticism <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yin</p>
<p>Immanuel Kant is one of the great thinkers of modern times. His philosophical thought, in a certain sense, is unique, just like Hegel and Feuerbach. If viewed formally, his views can be said to be not entirely the same as extreme idealism and general materialism. On the one hand, he acknowledges that things exist objectively, but on the other hand, he stands on the ground of a priori idealism. He once said: "We have no knowledge prior to experience; all our knowledge begins with experience." The so-called experience here, of course, refers to our experience of objectively existing things. Since Kant believed that knowledge comes from experience and is not innate, he naturally acknowledges the objective existence of things. At the same time, he also believes that the analysis of knowledge starts from the problem of sensation. In his view, sensation is the result of objectively existing things touching our minds and giving them influence. In other words, it means that sensation is caused by the contact between our senses, brain, and objectively existing things. This view not only shows that things exist objectively but also shows that human sensations, ideas, and thoughts are caused by objective things stimulating their senses and brains, and do not exist independently of objective things. From this point of view alone, Kant can be said to be a materialist. However, on the other hand, Kant is also clinging to a priori idealism. After expressing the above views, he went on to say: "Although all our knowledge begins with experience, not all our knowledge originates from experience. For it is very possible that our experience itself is composed of two kinds of elements: one is obtained from the impression of the senses, and the other is the mental part that our cognitive function innately adds to the impression of external things when it receives the impression of external objects. Therefore, this is not an easy question, and it cannot be answered lightly. It must be carefully considered before some certainty can be grasped. Is there any knowledge that not only breaks away from experience, but also breaks away from all impressions of the senses and exists independently? This kind of knowledge can be called a priori knowledge to distinguish it from empirical knowledge – a kind of knowledge that originates from a posteriori or experience." In this way, he immediately fell into the quagmire of idealism.</p>
<p>In such a contradiction, in retreating from materialism to idealism, Kant became a famous agnostic. He stated that we cannot but admit that things exist, but what exactly are things like? What exactly are things? This is something we absolutely cannot know. Things exist, but we cannot fully know the nature of things, things themselves. What we can know is not things themselves, but the phenomena that appear to us, things within the limits that we can see. Such agnosticism is the center of Kant's philosophy.</p>
<p>Kant himself said that his philosophy is idealism in the a priori and realism in the empirical. Therefore, on the question of the occurrence and constitution of thought and knowledge, he stands on the ground of realism, that is, he admits the objective existence of things; but on the question of how universally valid knowledge is, he stands on the ground of idealism, believing that the nature of things themselves is unknowable.</p>
<p>However, the position of realism and the position of idealism are incompatible. If things exist objectively apart from our minds, and if human ideas are a reflection of objectively existing things, then there can be no knowledge that transcends experience and the senses; conversely, if thought and knowledge are a priori and things are subordinate to the mind, then there can be no objectively existing things. Naturally, human sensations, thoughts, and consciousness are not only passive, but also have a positive and active reaction to objective things, because human senses are dynamic, not dead static objects. When receiving objective things, they can also play an active role; but this subjective active role of human beings is by no means independent and a priori, but occurs under the condition of objectively existing things. Therefore, the relationship between things and mind, objective and subjective, reality and idea, is not parallel. Kant juxtaposed the two, and the result was that he became a mysterious agnostic; in the final analysis, he was still an idealist. Strictly speaking, in philosophical thought, there is only the opposition between materialism and idealism; there can be no middle ground compromise outside this opposition. Kant's philosophy, in its achievements and in the appearance of its system, can be said to be unique, but in the final analysis, he is still a mysterious idealist; the only difference between him and general idealists lies only in the form of expression, or even only in the terms used.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since things exist objectively, and since humans can reflect objective things into thoughts and knowledge within a certain time and space, why can't we use this knowledge to understand those objective things? According to Kant, we can only know the phenomena that things present, not their noumenon, so things themselves are unknowable. However, the so-called phenomenon of things is the expression of its noumenon; the phenomenon is not something else that is opposed to the noumenon. If human senses and knowledge have an active role, then why can't people synthesize and penetrate the phenomena expressed by things to understand and know their noumenon? Naturally, human knowledge is subject to the limitations of time and space and can only be recognized and know the fixed noumenon of things within a certain time and space. It cannot transcend time and space to recognize things that are not yet knowable, but within a certain time and space, we can indeed recognize its noumenon through the phenomena that things show at that time. Kant's agnosticism believes that there is no possibility of recognizing and knowing things at all, which is another expression of mysterious idealism.</p>
<p>Engels and Ulyanov had a very correct criticism of Kant. According to them, the thing-in-itself, as Kant said, cannot be absolutely separated from the phenomenon. The thing-in-itself is expressed as a phenomenon, "the thing-in-itself is the thing for us." Agnosticism about the thing-in-itself is nothing more than one of the erroneous conclusions of the metaphysical theory of mechanically separating the thing-in-itself from the phenomenon—this is a very correct judgment.</p>

<p>News agencies can be said to be the assisting organs of newspapers and magazines. Their task is to establish communication networks in various parts of the world, collect various news items, and transmit them to newspapers, magazines, and other organizations by extremely rapid means. Because they have such a task, their propaganda effect is very great, and countries around the world pay great attention to the news agency business. When the situation is tense, the news agency activities of various countries are particularly important and can play an active role. Not to mention the distant past, just the activities and roles of major news agencies in the world in the recent Italian-Abyssinian War can give us a general idea. According to investigations, at the beginning of the war, there were as many as eighty or ninety special correspondents from news agencies around the world in Addis Ababa, and now there are more than a hundred. These correspondents work almost every minute. They constantly transmit news of the war, especially news that is beneficial to their own countries, to London, Rome, Paris, Berlin, New York, Tokyo, and other places, so that the military actions of Italy and Abyssinia can be reflected in the eyes of people all over the world within a few hours. Among them, the activities of the British Reuters news agency were particularly active and effective. Its correspondents in Addis Ababa constantly propagated to the world the atrocities of the Italian army, the heroic resistance of the Abyssinian people, and all news that was beneficial to Britain. Although the Italian Stefani news agency tried hard to compete with it, the result was that Reuters' news spread all over the world. From the beginning of the Italian-Abyssinian War until now, the main reason why world opinion hates and condemns Italy is of course that people generally have a sense of justice to sympathize with small and weak nations and oppose the aggressive actions of imperialism, but the news propaganda of Reuters also plays an indispensable role in this.</p>
<p>Speaking of the organization of international news agencies, almost every country has one. The countries participating in the "National News Agency Alliance" mainly include 28 countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Germany, and there are also 28 major news agencies among them. Here we can only list a few of the most famous major news agencies in the world to give a general description.</p>
<p>British Reuters News Agency</p>
<p>This was originally founded by Julius Reuter, a German in the mid-19th century. Later, because this German transferred his nationality to Britain, the Reuters news agency he founded became the property of the British. At first, Reuters only used carrier pigeons to conduct commercial communications; it was not until it moved to London in 1851 that it used telegraph to transmit news, establishing its position in the news communication industry; then, with the overseas development of Britain, it established communication networks all over the world and became the center of the "World News Agency Alliance." The news agencies of various countries almost have to rely on it as a medium to connect.</p>
<p>Reuters is a special agency for transmitting foreign communications, which is different from the representative news agencies of other countries in this regard. Britain has another news agency that specializes in transmitting domestic news, called The Press Association. It has a close organic relationship with Reuters, and the two help each other to complete the task of domestic and foreign communications. Currently, The Press Association</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>has more than 130 branches throughout Britain, using 3,000 miles of privately installed wires to transmit domestic news and distribute Reuters' foreign news to the country. Reuters relies mainly on this British domestic communication agency to collect British news for foreign news agencies that have an agreement with it.</p>
<p>The relationship between Reuters and the British domestic communication agency was initially only a simple mutual cooperation, but later this communication agency became increasingly powerful, forcing Reuters to have a closer relationship with it; in 1925, Reuters even offered more than half of its profits to it, effectively transferring control to it. By now, although the name of Reuters still exists independently, it has actually been merged into The Press Association.</p>
<p>United Press Association of America</p>
<p>Commonly abbreviated as AP, Chinese newspapers often write it as "Meilianshe." It is jointly composed of 1,285 newspapers in the United States and is a purely news-collecting and disseminating agency. It is not for profit. The funds it needs are shared by the news agencies participating in this communication agency. The principle is not to raise capital and not to seek profits. As for the executive agency of the news agency, it is a council mutually elected by the participating news agencies.</p>
<p>The Associated Press can be said to be a cooperative business jointly run by 1,285 newspapers in the United States. On the one hand, these newspapers have the obligation to provide news to the communication agency regularly and without compensation, and on the other hand, the communication agency often distributes all the news it collects to these newspapers. They have a spider web-like dedicated wire network of 225,000 miles. This communication agency sends out an average of 100,000 words of news every day.</p>
<p>Although this communication agency is jointly run by many newspapers in the United States, and although two or three thousand newspapers regularly provide its news without compensation, its annual expenses are also more than nine million US dollars; its scale is the largest in the world. At the same time, it is also unique among the world's news agencies in that it is jointly run by many newspapers.</p>
<p>French Havas News Agency</p>
<p>This can be said to be the largest and only news agency in France. In addition to transmitting news, it also operates advertising agency business. Historically, the establishment of Havas was actually earlier than Reuters. Now, in addition to gaining a monopolistic position in France, it also shows great strength in Spain, Portugal, and South America.</p>
<p>Havas is also one of the centers of the "World News Agency Alliance." Due to its development, Reuters' position has also been weakened. In the current world news agencies, Havas is as valued as Reuters.</p>
<p>German Wolff Telegraph News Agency</p>
<p>Before the Great War, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, and Central Europe can be said to have been all the territories of Wolff, but after the war, with the decline of German power, it also lost its original territory. Now, it is still the largest communication agency in Germany. As for the organization, Wolff, like Havas, is a joint-stock company.</p>
<p>Italian Stefani News Agency</p>
<p>This was originally a news agency formed by joining the French Havas.</p>
<p>organization, but it has now become the only international communication agency officially run by Italy. Its current task is to promote the aggressive doctrines of the Blackshirt Prime Minister. After the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War, it kept propagandizing the victory of the "civilized" army, but in fact, apart from newspapers under Mussolini's control publishing its news, it seems that no one accepted its communications. This is partly because most people do not sympathize with the use of poison gas to poison small and weak nations, and partly because the organization of this news agency is small and its power is weak.</p>
<p>Soviet TASS News Agency</p>
<p>TASS is the abbreviation of the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union. Originally, the Soviet Union's foreign communication agency after the October Revolution was initially the Rota News Agency, but in 1926 it withdrew from the international communication system, and the TASS news agency replaced it.</p>
<p>Although TASS also participates in the "World News Agency Alliance," it is essentially different from Reuters and Havas. If Reuters and Havas are the political megaphones of British and French imperialism, then TASS is a powerful news propaganda weapon of the Soviet Union. It not only transmits general news, but also pays special attention to news about various contradictions in the current world, and constantly disseminates to the world the true situation of news that Reuters and others are unwilling to transmit or distort.</p>
<p>Like Reuters has a close relationship with the British domestic communication agency and newspapers, TASS also has a deep relationship with the domestic communication agencies of the Soviet Union. They help each other in the collection and dissemination of news. However, the news agencies in the Soviet Union are state-owned. Although TASS is mutually dependent on domestic communication agencies, it is also constrained by domestic communication agencies. In this respect, it can be said that the situation is also different from that of Reuters.</p>
<p>Japan News Federation Originally, Japan's international communication was occupied by Reuters. However, since the establishment of this News Federation in 1924, Reuters has also lost this area. This News Federation is jointly formed by the eight major newspapers in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places; its organizational principle is similar to that of the United Press Association of America.</p>
<p>In Japan, there is also the Telegraph Communication Agency, which is opposed to this News Federation. However, although these two are the largest communication agencies in Japan, their transmission of international news still depends on European and American communication agencies.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to strengthen news propaganda, Japan has seen the merger of the Union and Dentsu. At the same time, in strengthening news control, Japan has recently seen the establishment of the Allied News Agency with the Union as its parent.</p>
<p>In addition, the Balkan, Iberian Peninsula, Central Europe, Northern Europe, and Baltic countries also have large communication agencies participating in the "World News Agency Alliance," but I cannot describe them all here.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Interior View of a Beauty Hospital <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zheng</p>
<p>We are now in an era where social openness is advocated by everyone, and the young men and women of Shanghai are particularly at the forefront of this movement. Therefore, the cries of "physical fitness" and "beauty" are flying everywhere. As a result, beauty hospitals have emerged to meet this great need.</p>
<p>The clients of beauty hospitals are not only a large number of women, but also many men who consider themselves unattractive, and enthusiastically seek advice. This is because beauty hospitals don't just do makeup for people; they can also transform faces full of freckles and wrinkles into clean, white, and tender skin, flatten out pockmarks and scars until they are unnoticeable, and do their best to bring out your physical beauty and restore the charm you've lost.</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation of beauty treatments, this reporter recently made a special visit to the Shi's Beauty Hospital. According to the investigation, this beauty hospital is indeed the first of its kind in Shanghai, having been established for five years. It is located in the Women's Bank Building, which is next to the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road. We can see many gorgeously dressed women burning incense and praying at Hongmiao Temple, while at the same time going to the beauty hospital for "treatment," using the help of science to increase their youth and happiness.</p>
<p>When this reporter arrived at the waiting room of the beauty hospital, the staff at the registration desk probably thought I was there for beauty treatments and asked me to register. I explained that I was there for a special visit, so he asked me for a business card and went into the office. I saw a sign hanging at the registration desk that read: "Consultation Hours: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily. Closed Sunday afternoons." "Registration Fee: $1.60, subsequent visits $0.60 each." After a while, a gentleman in a Western suit came out of the office. He introduced himself as Mr. Tu, in charge of business affairs, and asked what I wanted to see. I said I was there for a special visit. He then went into the consulting room to tell Doctor Shi Shuanghu. Soon, Doctor Shi came out. He was a man in his thirties, with a short beard and glasses, from Fujian. He didn't speak Mandarin very well, but his attitude was very sincere. I paid special attention to his own face, and indeed his skin was moisturized, white, clean, and refreshing, and his clothes were extremely neat. He led me to first observe the consulting room. Although the room was not large, the arrangement was very elegant. A desk was placed in front of the window, and in addition to stationery, there were dozens of small glass bottles and glass containers similar to small wine glasses. It was said that these all contained medicinal products for use. Next to the window was a filing cabinet, which was said to contain newspapers, magazines for reference, and special publications compiled by Mr. Shi himself. The lighting inside was particularly bright, making it extremely clear to see people's faces, which I assumed was for easy facial examination. Next to the consulting room was the electrotherapy room, which was equipped with a sun lamp and a rectangular cabinet-like electrical cabinet. It was said that this was a "hot light" and "quartz lamp" irradiator, which could irradiate the whole body, the face, and be used for electrotherapy on women's flat breasts, etc. It was explained that electrical irradiation could quickly circulate the blood in the body, activate internal cells, and that, in addition to removing wrinkles and spots on the skin with lotions, electric current could also help with their treatment. A specially made leather-padded chair was provided for the patient during electrotherapy, resembling the chairs used in barbershops. Next to it were hot and cold water pipes and a washbasin, and various cosmetics were displayed, such as: Beauty Dew, Almond Honey, Beauty Snow (the above three types are used instead of vanishing cream, but their effects can remove wrinkles, prevent freckles, minimize pores, and provide a foundation that doesn't fade), Beauty Body Fluid (also known as Body Beauty Dew, can prevent skin diseases and keep skin white and tender), Sunscreen Beauty Cream (prevents sunburn), Mouth Fragrance (removes bad breath and protects teeth), Glycerin Soap (non-irritating and alkaline-free, can keep skin white and tender), Depilatory (can remove beards without harming the skin), etc., all made by Mr. Shi himself. The reporter picked up bottle after bottle to look at, try, and ask about their effects. I only felt a fragrant aroma, delicate and smooth, unlike ordinary products. It was said that these kinds of cosmetics sold very well.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Shi, the medical skills of the beauty hospital include the following:</p>
<p>Facial: Removal of freckles, mole removal, removal of various colors (yellow, gray, black, white, red) spots, making rough, dark skin white and tender, turning dark neck skin white, skin whitening injections, removal of facial keratosis, removal of acne, pimples, scars, removal of sores, flattening of pockmarks, removal of facial tumors, removal of facial boils, facial (illegible) removal, etc.</p>
<p>Various Electrotherapies: Facial electrotherapy, body electrotherapy, breast electrotherapy.</p>
<p>Eye and Eyebrow Area: Cataract (blindness) surgery, eyebrow growth, eyebrow reshaping, turning single eyelids into double eyelids, surgery for uneven eyes, enlarging small eyes, eye leakage, inward and outward turning of eyelids, strabismus surgery, (illegible).</p>
<p>Nose Area: Rosacea, stopping excessive nasal oil, red nose removal, rhinoplasty, polyp removal, nasal polyps.</p>
<p>Lip Area: Harelip (cleft lip) closure, narrowing wide mouths, teeth whitening, separating lip adhesions from skin.</p>
<p>Ear Area: Earlobe repair, ear tumors, separating ear adhesions from skin.</p>
<p>Hand and Foot Area: Turning dark and rough skin on upper limbs white and tender, oily gray nails, armpit odor (body odor), itchy toes, corns.</p>
<p>Makeup: Light makeup, heavy makeup, special makeup (electrical makeup), hair loss prevention, hair growth, bald head hair growth, changing fat to thin, changing emaciation to plumpness, chest and breast development injections.</p>
<p>Among these, the flattening of pockmarks is the most troublesome. It is said that if the pockmarks are on good skin and the marks are clearly demarcated, then the procedure is extremely easy, and large pockmarks can be flattened in twenty days. However, if the pockmarks are in clusters and not clearly distinguishable, and the skin is too tight, then it often takes five to six months. Rhinoplasty is also quite troublesome, i.e., turning a flat nose into a high nose bridge, as the saying goes. In the past, beauty doctors mostly used hard wax, which was a bit like a joke, because the result looked like a fake nose, and if you weren't careful, it would collapse again. However, the ivory support method can now be used to remedy this. Also, for the removal of sores, ordinary surgeons mostly cut and then suture the wound, but Dr. Shi invented a method that only requires applying a homemade lotion around the sore, turning the skin in that area into rubber, and then slowly shaving it off with a small knife, so that it naturally heals flat without leaving a mark. The same is true for turning single eyelids into double eyelids; you only need to draw a line with homemade lotion, and that area will naturally separate to form double eyelids. However, this is not applicable to people with excessively upturned eyelids. Mr. Shi studied in Tokyo and later opened a beauty hospital in Singapore. In Shanghai, his most famous surgery is the radical cure of freckles, and he has invented a radical freckle-curing lotion that is extremely effective. After the reporter's visit, I returned to the waiting room and saw three or four fashionable women waiting there for consultation. I shook hands with Dr. Shi to say goodbye and walked out of the hospital door in a burst of fragrant air.</p>

<h3 id="e217">The Historical Development of Weapons <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Jun</p>
<p>Humans are animals that can use and manufacture tools, and weapons are naturally one of the tools that humans use to conduct life struggles. If the progress of production tools is the manifestation of human evolution, then the evolutionary process of humanity can also be seen in the historical development of weapons.</p>
<p>Weapons can be said to have existed since primitive times. However, the weapons at that time were very immature and crude, and were only used to deal with wild beasts and poisonous snakes, and were not used by humans to kill each other. The appearance of weapons for human warfare occurred after the formation of pastoral and agricultural societies, and after the emergence of private property systems. Because at that time, humans had fixed living areas, had privately owned property, and therefore wars to seize land, property, and slaves occurred.</p>
<p>The earliest weapons can be said to have been made of stone; bronze weapons then appeared; as for the appearance of iron weapons, it was around three thousand years before the Common Era. The first to use iron weapons were the Egyptian infantry. They had spears as long as six feet, shields covered with iron sheets on sturdy wood, and a saber hanging horizontally on their waists. Naturally, there were also bows and arrows at that time, as well as various specialized archers. But the most formidable weapon at that time was an early type of chariot. These chariots were of different weights: light chariots moved farther and were mostly used on general battlefields; heavy chariots could penetrate deep into the enemy's center, directly charging the enemy and inflicting fatal attacks.</p>
<p>After Egypt, what is worth mentioning is of course the weapons of the Greek era. Indeed, around the sixth century before the Common Era, Greece had very organized standing armies, which were mostly composed of infantry. Among this infantry, there was a distinction between heavy infantry and light infantry: the former belonged to the upper ranks, and their weapons were spears, short swords, shields, and armor; the latter belonged to the lower ranks, and they used knives and crossbows as weapons, without protective shields and armor. Horses were already commonly used for combat at this time, but knights could not yet use stirrups, because the appearance of stirrups was five hundred and fifty years after the Common Era. As for the most outstanding weapon at this time, it was the spear, which was more than twenty feet long. When fighting, the so-called spearmen relied on large shields for protection, held twenty-foot-long spears, stood in front of the formation, and charged forward. Alexander, who established unprecedented military achievements in history, actively developed the power of these spears.</p>
<p>Following the Greek era was the Roman era. The typical weapon of this era was a double-edged short sword. The sword was twenty inches long and was suitable for both thrusting and short chopping; this weapon is not known how many people it killed. In addition, darts and spears were also commonly used by warriors in the Roman era. These warriors wore iron helmets, armor, and short swords at their waists, and carried long or short spears, with darts that could be thrown at any time. They were truly awe-inspiring and looked like they wouldn't blink an eye when killing people.</p>
<p>However, history showed the greatest enemy of Rome, which were the Muhammadan believers who "held a sword in their right hand and the Koran in their left hand." They had Chinese-style green dragon crescent blades, as well as short spears, swords, darts, bows and arrows, and other weapons. However, they were fearless of death. They didn't wear helmets or use shields on the battlefield, and they charged straight ahead, which the Romans couldn't resist.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, European society entered the dark period of the Middle Ages, which is the so-called feudal era in social history. The feudal lords of this era all raised many warriors to be loyal to themselves, and thus the famous knights of the Middle Ages appeared.</p>
<p>In order to show their majesty and to win over the hearts of their subordinates, the lords did not hesitate to desperately exploit the peasants, arming their knights in a very mighty and gorgeous manner; according to historical facts, the cost of arming each knight was at least thirty pounds. These knights rode fat horses, wore short swords, and carried long spears and double swords, and they had to fully express their heroic spirit everywhere.</p>
<p>The infantry under the knights mainly used spears, short swords, and shields. In the infantry, there were archers whose arrows could reach seventy to one hundred and fifty yards. This can be said to have been one of the most powerful weapons at that time.</p>
<p>The most famous war of the Middle Ages was undoubtedly the Crusades. In this war, the activity of cavalry occupied a very important position. Both the European cavalry and the Turkish cavalry wore swords, spears, bows, and arrows, but due to the climate, the Turkish cavalry were more lightly armed; at the same time, the swords they used were also slightly different from those of Europe, namely, theirs were curved, while those used by Christian Europe were straight swords.</p>
<p>Due to the repeated Crusades, due to the continuous wars, and due to the development of industry, with the end of the dark period of the Middle Ages, weapons also made leaps and bounds. Taking bows as an example, around the sixteenth century, the old bows (Longbow) gradually became crossbows (Crossbow). The power of this crossbow was several times that of the bow, and it could shoot beyond two hundred and fifty yards without losing its effectiveness.</p>
<p>But the biggest event at this time was the invention of gunpowder and the appearance of artillery. Originally, gunpowder had already existed in China around one thousand years before the Common Era, but Europeans began to use gunpowder for guns and cannons during the Renaissance. What is worth mentioning here is that in 1540, a famous person named Vitelli invented a short gun that was less than two feet long. Although it was not as sophisticated and powerful as modern pistols, it was easy to fire and carry, and it can be said to have been the most modern weapon at the time. As for the appearance of cannons, it was earlier than the invention of this short gun. In the fourteenth century, the German army used cannons to win battles. In the Battle of Constantinople in 1453, Muhammad II also organized an artillery team, using seventy cannons; among them, three had a caliber of twenty-five inches, and could project a stone of one thousand five hundred pounds to a mile away. The Greek army that fought against it can be said to have been defeated by these cannons.</p>
<p>The appearance of such cannons and short guns is worth noting in the history of weapons. Because with these things, especially with the development of these things, the old swords, spears, halberds, etc. would gradually lose their effectiveness in war, and the old martial arts would gradually become historical relics, so the strategy and tactics in war would inevitably change. Based on this point, we can say that the weapons and wars before the appearance of guns and cannons in the sixteenth century were ancient and feudal, and the weapons and wars after that were modern.</p>
<p>In modern history, there have also been many major wars; in these wars, many new and strange weapons have appeared. Now let's briefly examine the weapons of several major eras.</p>
<p>First is the famous Napoleonic era. In this era, the infantry weapons used by Napoleon to disturb all of Europe were rifles and bayonets. It is said that at one point, Napoleon discovered that his soldiers had abandoned their bayonets, so he seriously said to the soldiers: "The bayonet is the best weapon for soldiers, and it is the most suitable weapon for French soldiers. Anyone who loses his bayonet will be severely punished!" When Napoleon commanded the Italian army, he abolished the swords held by the army and replaced them with bayonets. This was because the bayonet could be used with the rifle at the same time, which was more convenient; it could also show great power in hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>The army of the Napoleonic era, of course, had complete infantry, cavalry, artillery, and logistics. Among these, apart from the engineers and logistics soldiers who had special tasks, the cavalry's weapons of war were similar to those of the infantry, and the artillery mainly used six-, eight-, and twelve-pound cannons, although there were also sixteen-pound cannons, but the number was very small.</p>
<p>Second is the weapons of the Franco-Prussian War era. Almost many of the most powerful weapons currently used already existed at that time. For example, the rifles used by the French army at that time had an effective shooting range of one thousand three hundred yards. This was of course much more powerful compared to the rifles of the Napoleonic era. As for the cannons used by the artillery, although those used by the French were larger than those used by the Germans, because the French loaded the shells from the muzzle, while the Germans loaded the shells from the breech, the power of the latter actually exceeded that of the former.</p>
<p>In the Franco-Prussian War, German artillery displayed its greatest power. Its artillery formation was: 1. Fifteen steel rifled cannons; 2. Twelve bronze rifled cannons; 3. Nine steel rifled cannons; 4. Fifteen bronze rifled howitzers; 5. Twenty-one cm bronze rifled field guns. Under the power of such an artillery formation, the French army was defeated.</p>
<p>Finally, of course, are the weapons that appeared in the World War that broke out in 1914, which are the well-known airplanes, tanks, poison gas, etc. As for the weapons of future wars, they will certainly be even more powerful, which we will soon see. However, the development of weapons can be said to have reached its peak, so what is its future? We dare to boldly say: it will disappear permanently with the permanent elimination of human mutual national strife.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Printing Workers <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yongkang</p>
<p>I have been working in the printing bureau for ten years. I came here as an apprentice when I was thirteen years old, and now I have been promoted to the "imposition" work. In these full ten years of life, I have only been friends with "type". What we see, what we handle, and what we pay attention to are all "type". All day long in this room with not much sunlight and not very well ventilated air, breathing the smell of "ink" and oil smoke. I have long felt that life is too monotonous and too boring, and I really want to change my taste and find another job; but I seem to have become a specialized typesetter, and in this era of unemployment panic, I have to make do.</p>
<p>When I came here ten years ago, people all called me "student boy". The work of the student boy was to "select type" and "return type". Before selecting and returning type, you had to learn the "categories" of Chinese characters. The way to recognize "character collections" was entirely according to the "Kangxi Dictionary". Now, of course, I am very familiar with it. But at that time, I was only at the level of a higher primary school student? There were so many Chinese characters, and the classification was so complicated, that it took me two months of "trial learning" to barely memorize them. But the "radicals" of Chinese characters and "elements" could not always follow the general rules. For example, the character "分" (fēn, divide), do you think it is in the "八" (bā, eight) radical? But it is actually in the "刀" (dāo, knife) radical. And like the "阝" (yì, city) radical and the "阝" (fù, mound) radical, sometimes it is hard to distinguish them clearly. So after two months of trial learning, I only remembered some generally, as for detailed classification, it took at least two years to become familiar with it. "Type" is generally placed obliquely on rows and rows of wooden shelves, and characters with the same radical are placed in the same column. In the same column, characters with fewer strokes are placed in front, and characters with more strokes are placed behind, arranged in the same way as characters in the dictionary. But selecting type is much more difficult than looking up a dictionary. After you select one character, you may have to run several steps to find the second character. Because the arrangement of characters on the "original manuscript" is not arranged according to the order of the dictionary. You run once to select a character, and you run ten times to select ten characters. If you select a thousand characters without rest, your head will already be dizzy, not to mention that you only have the opportunity to stand and run, and you never have the opportunity to sit for a quarter of an hour? I worked as a student boy for three years. I continued to stand for three years and ran for three years in the "type room". Not only were my legs sore and numb, but they also turned yellow and swollen. And my eyes? New type is easy to recognize, but ninety percent of the type has been stained with ink, and in a room with dim sunlight, you have to stare hard to be able to distinguish it.</p>
<p>The selected type you put on the "tray", arranging them row by row according to the order of the original manuscript, ready for others to take away for "imposition". When the form has been made, or has been printed, or has been "paper pasted", this "type form" has to be removed, and the removed type is returned by us student boys, which is called "returning type". Returning type is almost as troublesome as selecting type. Where you picked it up from, you have to run around to return it to its original place, and the order of the character collection must not be confused at all, otherwise it will be even more troublesome to select it the second time.</p>
<p>Selecting type and returning type are the minimum work for us typesetters, but also the hardest work. Our hands are all covered in black ink, so you can't wipe your face or rub your nose, otherwise you'll be covered in ink. You never wear clean clothes all year round. But the wages are extremely pitiful. Generally, ten hours of work a day can earn thirty to forty cents of silver. The number of characters selected and returned in a day is at least four thousand or more. When I get home at night, my legs and feet ache all night long, and my eyes are red and swollen. I still can't recover by the next morning, but I still have to drag my tired body to work.</p>
<p>The apprentice life of selecting type and returning type for three years is considered to be completed. The clever ones can be promoted to "engraving" workers, and the clumsy ones still select type, return type, or "dismantle forms". On the surface, "engraving" is much more comfortable and economical than the first step of work. You can sit still and talk a little cleaner; but engraving those five-point and six-point characters, and using lead for engraving, not only can your eyes not stand it, but you</p>
