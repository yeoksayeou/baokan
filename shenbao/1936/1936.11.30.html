<h3>中日問題的基本認識（下）</h3>
<p>— 周憲文</p>
<p>—讀山崎靖純先生排日的中國以後—</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>現在日本人自己不去另求出路，而反欲以中國爲維持其資本主義的犧牲品，道理由我百思不得其解。山崎先生或謂：現在「……根本言之，是過去二百年所建設的世界資本主義經濟體系，已入崩潰過程，新的世界經濟體系——當然這是在資本主義揚棄之中——正在再組織的過程，所以這是集團時代的展開，在遠東，結果是由歐美的桎梏開放遠東的民族，這其間絕對需要組織一個公正的集團。今日的資本主義日本，對於這種根本的要求，儘先而且粗野的發揮，因而受到中國民衆的反感，但畢竟這是因爲世界的原因，日本才有這種要求，而同時也爲遠東民族團結的必要。」山崎先生這話是吿訴我們，日本並不要中國做維持其資本主義的犧牲品，而祇希望中日人民共同來組織遠東民族集團，以圖解脫「歐美的桎梏。」但是在我看來，所謂　團的組織，這固然是「過去一百年所建設的世界資本主義經濟體茶已入崩潰過程」之必然現象，但此必然現象的產生，仍不外爲幾個先進的資本主義國家欲藉以延續其資本主義的生命。所以大英帝國要拉攏印度，澳州，來組織集團，金元帝國要拉攏南美諸邦來組織集團，這與日本之欲拉攏所謂滿洲」與「支那」來組織「日，滿，支集團，」甚而擴大至於所謂遠東或亞洲集團，初無一致；惟其如此，在被拉攏的國家，實在不像山崎先生這樣覺得有絕對的必要。如果設九一八事變以來，日本帝國主義的行動，正是由於組織遠東集團的要求，那末，中國對於這種集團，不單覺得沒有必要，且將引以爲懼。</p>
<p>「事實勝於雄辯」，英美帝國主義給予中國的難堪」，我們絕不否認，但是我們所最「難堪」的是東北四省失地未曾收回，而冀察綏東又在吿警；諸如白銀的偷運，私貨的走漏；都對中國人民給以難堪的印象，所以成都北海這些事件的發生，我們雖然覺得萬分不幸而引爲遺憾，但若我們追究這些事件之所以發生，則又不得不認爲「原內有自，决非偶然。老實說，在中國有錢人的中間，確有一部份」頭腦比較淸楚」的，他們所担憂的，遠東的根本問題，不是中國與日本的問題，而是共產非共產的問題；如果在中國並無被共產」的威脅，他們抗日的决心也許比現在更加堅决；近來中國共產黨宣言：可以取消蘇區，主張各黨各派聯合一致抗日，這正欲藉以减少共產對於一部份中國人的威脅，來推進他們抗日的男氣；這一部份人本來很可爲中日携手的中堅，但在日本現政策之下，亦使他們躊躇不前；胡適之先生曾經提出調整中日邦交的最低限度，如取消治外法權與塘沽協定之類，但結果仍如石沉大海，在這種情形之下，山崎先生要說中日携手，那就難乎其難了。對於此點，山崎先生似乎也知道，所以說：「中日携手的重大點，是日本先把握住中國人的心；日本如果要說防共，則日本必須給中國人比防共更大的利害，否則防共絕對不能成功。在日本要學意德的意識與方式，那是特別危險。因爲意德的理想，毫無世界的價值，而他們的對手，則爲非洲的黑人；中國人决不是黑人，中國人很懂得人情的機微，具有一種優美的人生哲學；就此而言，中國人是第一流民族。如果不先在日本建立如何可使這民族與日本共存共榮與公正提携的理論與方式，則結果，日本有被蘇俄所敗的危險。一誠然！誠然！我現在所希望於山峙先生者，即請研究如何先在日本建立起可使中國與日本公正提携與共存共榮的理論與方法。這除就日本的帝國主義制度，加以改革外，恐無其他更好的辦法吧。</p>
<p>如果，日本能够建立起可使中國與日本公正提携與共存共榮的理論與方式，則中國方面，自然樂於接受；蓋目前中國人的目標，僅在抗日，卽反抗日本帝國主義的侵略，要是日本不是一個帝國中義的國家，不向中國侵略，則中國人就失了「抗」的目標，中日携手，毫無問題。所以我對於解决中日問題的基本認識，是仍希望日本「反求諸己」，中國人决不以鄰爲壑，要求日本向中國以外的地方侵略；中國人也决不哀聲訴苦，請求日本憐其貧弱；至於吃了砒霜藥死老虎的辦法，（注意辦法）當然也决不是中國人所願意。中國人所欲努力掙取者，祗是死裏求「生」。凡有助於中國之「生」的，中國人無不盡力以求之。</p>
<p>最後，我得完全同意山崎先生對於中國目前建設目標的批評，他說：「中國如欲完全脫離極其深刻的列國帝國主義的桎梏，而完成眞正近代的國家，……則爲對抗列國的壓迫計，非先準備近代的武裝不可，在此武裝的背後，須謀國民敎育的澈底，而允須大大擴充生產能力；一山崎先生並以其尖銳的眼光，看出中國目前許多高樓大厦之類的建設，（舉例從略）「這不是主張臥薪嘗瞻的政府所應爲一，「這祇是北平萬　山Ideology的新形態而已。一現在我想在此重申我的舊說，以爲本文的結束。我對於中國的建設目標，在數年前（時在九一八事變以後）早就中張：（見新中華二卷二期）</p>
<p>「第一中國的建設，在手段上，必須籍以增强反對列强對華侵略的力量。</p>
<p>「第二：中國的建設，在使命上必須推進生產事業，眞正增加人民的收人，改善人民的生活。</p>
<p>並認「凡以從中謀利，抽收捐稅，粉飾太平，及鞏固地盤爲動機的建設，固然是救國不足，亡國有餘；就是一切以便利消費爲中心的建設，同樣可以收到建設亡國的結果。」降至近年，因爲日本帝國主義的步步進通，國難的萬分嚴重，我且進而主張目前中國應以國防建設爲主，生產建設爲輔，曾謂：在今日，「農工百業的交困，即整個國民經濟的沒落，固然是目前政府當局必須設法挽救的要圖，而强敵得寸進尺的侵略，尤爲目前政府當局急須設法掙脫的急務；由前一說，固然政府目前要有以推進生產改善人民生活爲目的　建設，由後一說，政府目前更加要有以準備抗敵保全民族生命爲目的的建設，兩者相較而以後者尤爲急切。」現在我們應該顧慮到國難的十分嚴重，民挨的危險萬狀，把目前一切的一切，統集中於準備救亡的一點，在這次關係存亡的抗敵戰爭中，能够多支持一點一刻的辰光，都是我國家的幸福與民族的光榮；萬一將來抗敵而失敗，則繼之而起的，必是更長期的，更艱苦的民族解放運動，在這一運動之中，我們祇有更深的破壞，絕不容有何建設，有之惟建設我民挨解放的陣綫，以與敵人相肉搏而已。」（見政問週刊第十九號）。這些話，本來是我對於政府「過　建設」的批計，也可說是對於政府「目前建設」的希望。我所以希望政府要以國防建設爲主，生產建設爲輔，最人的目的，原在解除當前帝國主義（尤其是日本帝國主義）的束縛，所以對於這種建設，絲毫沒有把中國建設成帝國主義的企圖；惟其如此，所以建設的方式，亦與帝國主義者異趣，這恐爲一般已受帝國主義的意識支配的學者所不甚了解的，希望國人予以深切的注意</p>

<h3>如何維護國家之主權</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>德日反共恊定宣布以後。繼之以意日間成立妥協。侵略陣綫之密圖膠台。至是殆已臻於具體化。在法西斯集團露骨表示之下。和平國家之戚受威脅。自無待言。而我國以剝蝕之殘幹。當棼亂之局面。把握一有不愼。卽易受其牽掣。不知者方謂包圍情勢所加。無求不可得饜。知之者則謂獨立國家之基礎。故自有其生存之條伴。凡屬圓顱方趾之倫。寧無保國愛家之念。人以刀爼自居。我則甘爲魚肉。雖至愚者。亦不出此。野心家一手造成之事實。亦徒見其心勞日拙而已。</p>
<p>我國自九一八事變以來。所遭受侵略之損害。亦旣爲舉世所洞稔。當局本其酷愛和平之心理。不惜出於最大之容忍。以期事態之逐漸改善。而不知此願竟如緣木而求魚。祗見變本以加厲。迄於今日。一方正在盛唱調整邦交之高調。一方乃有綏亂不堪收拾之趨勢。而侵略集團之面目。復於此予世以共見。夙經蹂躪之我國人民。在此充分認識之下。其中心之懷想又何如乎。</p>
<p>綏事發動之始。吾人逆知匪僞之必難得逞。誠以危機已入最後之階段。民族將有絕滅之可能。自非喪狂之輩。必多動色相向。由是而激發士心。鼓勵守志。正氣所在。義無返顧。更就匪僞內部而言。或出於一時之脅從。或惑於利祿之勸誘。遂至爲虎作倀。自殘同類。要其居心內愧。寧有必死之志。以負嵎之師。當烏合之衆。其非對手。彰彰明芸。果也陶林興和之役。匪偽迭遭挫敗。綏北國軍於乘勝之餘。遂得進攻百靈廟而下之。雖由人力。亦順逆之勢使然也。風聞匪僞於失敗之後。仍圖大舉進犯。而某方軍隊。亦已凖備緊急出動。其欲擴大亂事。用意灼然可覩。預計國軍此後於捍衛工作上。必將遭遇更强烈之搏戰。可斷言也。</p>
<p>和平有其最後之限度。此爲我國最高當局歷次申說之主見。而維持領土之宣言。亦全國上下所共喻。此次綏戰發生。卽有中央軍隊陸續開往。而自反共恊定傳播以後。我外部發言人更一再表示不容第三者侵犯主權。凡此皆足以見我當局維護領土之决心。蓋在一獨立國家。主權奚啻生命。斷不能聽從第三者任意摭拾之口實。而輕易屈意相酬答。勦匪不問背景之何若。防共應以自力爲主體。二者爲我當局聲述之要點。亦人民最低限度之要求。天經地義。無可非難。不幸而有侵犯主權之事實發生。固將以全國之力排觝之。任何犧牲。所不辭矣。</p>

<h3>意德英法　海軍力比較　意德積極造艦</h3>
<p>（巴黎）小巴黎人報海軍記者頃就德意日三國成立諒解之後、各主要海軍國所有感受之影響、加以論別、並就意德英法四國海軍造艦程序作一比較、</p>
<p>（甲）意國積極進行之造艦程序、包括各種軍艦四十六艘、其總噸位爲一一七·〇〇〇噸、其最要者計有（一）三萬五千噸主力艦兩艘、（二）潛水艇二十四艘共一萬五千噸、</p>
<p>（乙）德國海軍總噸位、在短時期之內可達三〇〇·〇〇〇噸、其中七〇·〇〇〇噸乃係旣有各艦之總噸位、其餘二三〇·〇〇〇噸則屬於新艦、當以四年完成之、其分配情形如下</p>
<p>（一）一九三四—三一五年度造艦程序載有五四·五〇〇噸一其中兩　六千噸主力艦兩艘乃係依照歐戰蒂爾軍茨海軍上將所審定之主力艦沙恩電斯脫號型式所建造者、（二）九三五—三六年度造艦程序、載有七二·〇〇〇噸、其中一萬噸巡洋艦三艘、潛水艇二十六艘、（三）一九三六—三七年度造艦程序、載有九八·七〇〇噸、其中三萬五千噸主力艦一艘、兩萬噸航空母艦二艦、其速率當爲每小時卅七海里、至一九三七—三八年度造艦程序、當在短時期之內表决通過、大抵亦當包括三萬五千噸主力艦數艘、潛水艇多艘、綜上以觀、德國海軍一俟一九三七—三八年度造維程序完成之後、其實力卽可達英德兩國海軍協定所規定之限度、卽四〇〇、〇〇〇噸矣、（丙）英國　在建造中之新艦、僅有一五〇·〇〇〇噸、至一九三六年度造艦程序載有（一）各種軍艦（除潛水艇外）十七艘、共一二四·〇〇〇噸（二）潛水艇四艘、似此、英國海軍擴充計劃、以視他國已嫌遲緩、</p>

<h3>李維諾夫演說　痛詆法西斯主義　德意與日勾結和平之敵　蘇聯海軍顯有驚人發展</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇俄外委李維諾夫今日在全聯大會作激昂之演說、抨擊意德兩國、李氏宣稱、兩國經十五個月之談判、已完或秘密軍事同盟、渠由極可靠方面探悉、意國已向日本提出同樣之協定、墨索里尼視此爲報復蘇俄在國聯忠實反對意國遠反國聯盟的一舉之最佳辦法、渠完全信任蘇我力能單獨抵抗任何敵國或聯合之敵國、但同時俄國當爲和平奮鬬、而不求加入任何集團、或與他國相結合、蘇俄將靜待其他國家判斷因與蘇俄合作經營和平所得利益之價值、李氏並痛詆國社黨、謂彼等對佛蘭科將軍率非阿利安種之摩軍、以野蠻手段殺戮純粹之阿利安種，似無動於中、李氏誹笑蘇俄圖在西班牙實施共產主義、俾西班牙加入蘇聯之流言、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯紅海軍領袖一等艦隊司令奧爾洛夫、在蘇維埃大會發表演說、暢論帝國主義國家軍備競爭、特指日本德國及意大利海軍之擴充、渠云、「面對新帝國主義戰爭危險日益加速、尤其德日兩國之威脅諸事實、吾人雖決不願建立海軍以為侵略之用、然不得不創造強有力之自衛海道以及海上空軍與防衛海岸綫之設備、而此項自衛工具、近年來吾人業已創造成功、</p>
<p>「吾人如假定一九三三年一月一日吾海軍所有艦數為百分之一〇〇、則至一九三六年底、吾潛水艇已增百分之七一五、其他與潛水艇共同防衛吾海岸之小型戰艦則增百分之三〇〇、海岸防御之長距離大砲增百分之七五、海軍根據地防空高射砲數已增一倍、而海上空軍則已擴充至百分之五一〇」、</p>
<p>奧爾洛夫指出蘇聯海軍士兵品質之優良、潛水艇成績之特著、稱其超過規定之技術標準、繼在大會全體怒潮式之鼓掌聲中、結束其演說云、「普觀目前整個國際局勢、以及包圍蘇聯之資本主義世界所生一切事件、吾人必須建設、而目前業在建設真正偉大之海軍、包括技術標準極高之一切等級的戰艦」、（二十八日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>李維諾夫　演辭全文</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）李維諾夫在八决大會發表演說、歷時一小時有半、李氏首論及布爾喬亞自由民主之本質、指出「歐洲二十六資產階級國家中、尚保存所謂布爾喬亞自由民主者已不過十國、共他均爲决西斯或半法西斯獨裁政權、至法西斯國家之自由民主究竟如何、實不必細述、「蘇聯已成爲自由民主之保障、然並不發起組織國際集團、反抗否定自由民主之法西主義、吾人作爲一國家完全不問他國內部之法西斯政權、然法西主義則已越出各法西斯國之內政範圍、多年以來法西主義作俑者墨索里尼、並未在其對外政策中包括散播法西主義意大利境外之一條、然自從墨氏之法西中義被柏林修繕、其中注入德國國社主義理論之後、其形勢乃一變、德國國社主義與意式法西主義不同、彼在國內獲得立足點後、立卽擴大其活動於國境外」、</p>
<p>李氏繼述德國法西主義在幾乎全世界一切國家、均有間諜網活動、謂彼等不但向彼等寄居國之人民宣傳法西主義、不但執行密探工作、甚至進行恐怖活動、李氏云、「此種間諜網最近在蘇聯亦被破獲、然吾人並不因此種法西斯活動而驚怖、對於他國、彼爲眞正極大危險、甚至危及其存在、然對於吾人則吾、吾人極易在吾境內以吾自力處置之、吾人無須要求外國援助加以反抗、吾人亦不以此爲目的而締結國際同盟及協定、（大笑鼓掌）</p>
<p>「法西斯主義在外國活動、苟採取現在西班牙之形式、則更爲股重」、李氏舉例爲證、細述德意法西主義援助西斑牙之行爲及倫敦不干涉委員會之組織、李民申述蘇聯對於不干涉西斑牙內政諾言之忠實遵守、以及蘇聯屢决敦促委員會設法實施决議案之無效、李氏云、倫敦委員會之意、以爲不干涉者卽委員會本身不干涉他人之干涉、</p>
<p>「倫敦委員會此種决議、使法西斯國家將來一切違犯盟的之行爲、均獲得事先批准、因此、蘇聯政府乃不得不忠實對該委員會聲明、蘇聯政府在道德上不能比其他簽的國受該協定更大之束縛、因德意援助叛軍之結果、目前數星期來、日夜均有炸彈延燒彈數千公斤擲入西斑牙人民之美麗首都、和平之人民婦孺被屠殺者日以千計、人類最優秀之建築物·圖畫·彫型·等寳藏均被燬壞、而施行此種破壞工作者、卽爲德意之飛機及駕駛員、此種破壞工作卽德意第一法西斯國際所爲、渠等之積極合作、將永爲國際關係歷史及歐洲歷史上最可恥之一頁、（鼓掌、高呼「公平有理」）、</p>
<p>「大會全體必同意余言、當余等在此間談及西斑牙時、吾人之思想及情緒、充滿眞正同情與欣佩、業已飛向瑪德里之英勇守軍、以及奮勇抵抗野蠻主義及毀滅主義勢力之西斑牙共和軍英勇戰士全體」、怒潮般鼓掌、大會全體終向坐於外交人員席之西斑牙大使喝采）李氏繼云、「敵人現爲肆意造謠、謂吾人乃欲在比倫尼山半島創造共產黨蘇維埃國家、並欲將其收入蘇聯之內（笑聲）、此種爲無知小兒及成年蠢物編成之童話、（大笑鼓掌）其目的自係爲蒙蔽吾人對於西斑牙事件之眞用意起見、吾人之眞用意、乃因此次事件係法西主義第一次越出亡國邊界、企圖用國外武力培植西斑牙法西政權之嘗試、而苟此種嘗更終竟成功、則將來範圍必更擴大、實施於他國、</p>
<p>「吾人之出發點必爲此事實、卽法西主義不但爲一種特殊的國內政權、同時並爲對他國實行俊略、實行戰爭之準備、吾人本爲堅决主張國際和平之國家、然何以十分注意此種以外力在別國培植法西主義、培植侵略意識之企圖、由於上述一切事實、已十分明顯、而法西主義之所以集中攻擊於蘇聯、並非因所謂　宣揚共產主義、而實因蘇聯本身正乃法西主義侵掠慾之目的、同時又爲其他方侵略之障礙而已、</p>
<p>「法西主義因不能在仍主張集體安全制度之國聯會員國內覓得友軍、已成孤立、遂轉向同抱侵略目的之少數國家、與彼等結成集團、據稱深爲反抗「國際共產主義危險」、爲確切起見、余應指出所結成之集團乃非共同的、而係德意與德日各自單獨的、然吾人仍有確實之消息、深知意大利亦已向日本建議締結與業已公佈之日德協定一部份相類之協定、</p>
<p>「創造此種反共國際協定之作者、顯未注意彼等希望他人相信其協定眞係所爲思想性質的、其無聊爲如何可笑、消息靈通之人决不相信爲締結日德協定業已公佈之簡單二條、竟須十五個月長期談判、而日方之談判代表必須爲軍部將領、德方則爲一名超外交家、而此談判之進行、父必須在極端秘密之空氣中、</p>
<p>「有入猜測日德協定係用一種特殊密碼寫成、實屬可信、比如滿洲方面之日軍閥卽以己意解釋該密碼、竟打破蘇「滿」邊境長期之沉寂、於兩日內用强大之兵力侵入蘇境兩决、彼等乃未料到柏林之協定、並不能禁止遠東紅旗軍給以與前此侵入時相同之答復、（全塲喝采、一致起立對坐於主席團之遠東軍總司令布魯策元帥歡呼）、吾人希望日軍閥在接觸後抬回傷兵、及計算遺於蘇境之死屍及軍械時、應能覺悟此點、吾人希望在滿日軍閥雖獲得柏林協定、仍切記遠東紅軍之忠吿、「閣下散步時、請另找較遠之僻徑」、（大笑及鼓掌）、</p>
<p>「業已公佈之日德協定、實際不過另一協定之假面具、該協定係經同時談判、同時署簽甚至業已調印者、但並未公佈亦不預備公佈、余深知余發言之責任、然余仍聲稱日本軍事參贊與德國超外交家之談判十五月、卽爲商訂此秘密文件、其中關於共產主義一字未提、「法西主義國家最近之活動、除他事外、已完全暴露其自命如代表其政綱之某些政治宣言及口號之僞善與欺騙性質、此如德國法西主義會宣言在原則上反對任何國際同盟與集團、除不侵犯協定外、而此種協定亦祗可與隣邦締結、然渠今與日本締結協定、且非不侵犯協定矣、而日本距德國乃遠達數萬公里、其間並隔有多國也、德國法西主義曾發誓遵守戰爭局部化原則、然日德協定之傾向、固將使一大洲內發生之戰事、牽連至至少兩大洲也、</p>
<p>「意大利在併吞阿比西尼亞後、曾宣佈其土地慾業已滿足、宣稱以後將合作維持和平、然現在渠乃加入侵略協定矣、日本政府之名譽及誠意、亦未得到較良之證實、彼曾屢决向吾人聲言、欲與吾人建立和平關係、而使吾人設法滿足渠關於某些問題之慾望、而現在渠乃與德國締結秘密侵略協定、日政府又曾對吾人聲言、吾人所提之不侵犯協定尚在討論中、待一切爭執問題解决卽可簽定、而現在渠乃使此協定之締結、必須德國事先承認、减低其外交政策之獨立性、</p>
<p>「反民主之法西斯侵略國家已表明其態度、彼等已聲明不願參加保障和平保障入頻安全之國際合作、彼等對和平國家尤其民主的國家、已屢决挑戰、目前乃此種國家表明態度之時、蘇聯認定渠無改變其政策之理由、其政策仍爲和平政策、（久久鼓掌）蘇聯希望本國與他國共享和平、故對各國提出合作、蘇聯所期望於各國者非和平之空談、而爲組織和平之行動、</p>
<p>「然蘇聯並不懇求加入任何同盟、任何集團、任何聯合、蘇聯沉靜聽任其他國家估計與蘇聯密切合作對於和平之利益、而理解蘇聯所能與者實較其所取者爲多、（鼓掌）吾人今日所談諸協定之締結、其實於實際世事無所變更、危險不在協定、亦不在協定下之簽字、而在現有某種國家存在、其政府之外交政策乃以破壞和平爲基礎、以侵略虜刧爲基礎、彼等方努力奪取一切未被嚴密保護之事物、然此並不能震驚吾人、因吾人毫無保護不周之物、危險極大者乃其他國家及其他產業、吾人之安全不在一紙文伴及國外聯合上、蘇聯本身已充分强盛、而其威力將由大會行將通過之新憲法之强大膠合力而更行鞏固」，</p>
<p>李氏最後在全塲暴雷式之掌聲及喝采聲中、結束其演說云、「吾人深信苟一日來臨、迫使吾陸海軍不得不奮起保衛祖國時、則吾軍事的斯達罕諾夫主義、加以此種時機必生之熱忱、將使全世界得見歷史未有全球未聞之無窮的英勇與魄力、蘇聯將如永不可摧之堡壘、巍然曁立於法西斯濁海中、粉碎其層層濁浪、而因此堡壘之統率及其鎖鑰、乃握於超羣之司令官如吾先營偉大之領袖史丹林者之手、吾人之自信乃更堅强莫摧矣」、（二十八日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>南菲施行苛例　摧殘我僑胞商業（績）</h3>
<p>最國請願代表已抵滬　將晉京謁我當局請願</p>
<p>協定推翻　不能成議、害羣賊更再進而假以黨治國、神聖之威權、以黨部名義、誣揑何總領事以句庇共產、勾結反動之罪、而被撤職去矣、自何領去後、僑務日非、小人縱橫、優秀份子、皆效明哲保身之術、社會事業、視爲畏途、苛例壓迫則愈加嚴重、賃居律次於一九三七年五月一日頒行、到時華僑商戶、被淘汰者必多、生活上受莫大之威脅、近年各市政府、因賃居律之頒行在即及營業管理法所賦予之權力、完全拒絕發給華僑新張之商業牌照、華僑無可奈何、多轉向土人地點營業、適斐聯於一九三二年放棄金本位之後、凡百事業已恢復旣往之繁榮、且有捷足之進展、各市之市政稅收極裕、故皆銳意於市政建設、實行</p>
<p>黑白分居　而各市之土人地點、皆不適合衛生、汚穢異常、故全區內三十六個城巾之市政府、於一九三四年召開聯席會議、議决於短期間內、在各市外建設土人村、將市內之士人、遷往土人村居住、以改進市內之衛生、而所謂土人村者、則除土人有營業居住權外、其他人種不得參與、富有之城市、巳積極在市之邊境建設、該項土人村、其他各城市、俟財政解决、卽可着手進行建設、吾僑在賃居律及私城律限制之下、毫無活動之機會、所賴以維持生活者、惟土人居住之地點、華僑在各市土人地點之商戶、占全數華僑商店之半、今於各市政建戰之中將華僑顧客之土人、遷出市外、而又不准華僑跟隨其顧客而營業其商業、等於驅逐顧客、而又不准另謀職業、於無形中、消滅華僑商店之半數、蓋斐聯之壓迫亞洲僑民、在積極方面、則有明文之苛例、在消極方面、則有市政及經濟上之壓迫、吾僑在此重重壓迫之下、不特全無立足、而隨時皆有破產之虞、所感受之痛苦、非言語筆墨所能形容於萬一、菲聯之虐待吾僑、實在舉世所無、吾僑所處之境地、則有甚於奴隸、以上諸端、爲其犖犖大者而已、其餘之苛例、如移民律、酒例、以及其他」</p>
<p>不公平　之待遇、更屬書不勝書、移民律雖爲各國限制移民之工具、亦事屬正當、但亦未有菲聯亞洲移民律之慘、蓋變聯有歐洲亞洲移民律之分、歐洲之移、民律、從事優待歐洲之移民、藉以吸收歐洲渦剩之人口、亞洲移民律、則極其壓迫虐待之能事、於印度人及華僑之居留證、加印指膜、儼如罪犯、華僑干女、年逾十六不能入境、入境後居留未滿三年、不得離境、離境期限亦爲三年、逾期不得再復入境、警察隨時有檢查居留證之權、違命者則科以重懲、於是不良警察、大威福、華僑忍氣吞聲、莫能與抗、三二害羣賊、更爲虎作、敲榨勒索、無所不用其極、華僑之痛苦爲伺如、於此可見矣、其次則爲酒例、杜省酒例規定、凡有色人不用得飲酒、華僑被號爲</p>
<p>有色人種　故亦不飲酒、查菲聯以其奴隸之混血兒、爲有色人種、一切公民權利、不能享受、而華人亦竟被其認爲有色人種、故亦不享受公民權利、殊足令人憤慨、我具有五千年歷史之神明華冑、竟被此夜郎自大之菲聯、加以劣等混血種民挨之名詞、吾僑引爲絕大之國恥、其餘之不平等待遇、如飲食交通、娛樂運動、敎育等事除非與有色人種爲伍之外、其餘皆受禁止、甚至公共厠所、亦受禁止、吾僑之生活、又實是奴隸式之生活、簡直爲非人之生活也、總括言之、吾僑如此慘酷之虐待、其最大原因、實由中斐兩國未有訂立國交所以致之、以僑等愚見、思得一、</p>
<p>救濟方法　日本人向來旅斐之人數很少、除所受其他待遇、比較華僑略好之外、對於居住營業及購置不動產、亦受華僑同樣之限制自日菲紳士協定成立之後、日僑巳不受賃居律之限制、而有自由居住及營業之權、日僑旣除出賃居律之外、則其他之苛例、已連帶解除、故可以說旅斐之日僑、今已完全得列自由平等矣、至於吾僑、則自中菲紳士協定失敗之後、生活上不特毫無保障、苛例反變本加厲、痛苦更深、生活之斷絕不過時間問題、而將近成年之僑童、來日更不待言矣、然斐聯自一九二六年、獲得外交自立之後、外交上頗爲活　、業與法荷美意德葡等國成立協定、又與以上各國互換節使、用斐聯外交之目的、實爲謀他日國際地位之張本、外交旣經獨立、自當與各國建立邦交、然後始有外交自主之實效、吾則亦永遠爲大英帝國之附屬品耳、若吾政府能體恤僑艱、不以華僑人數稀少而忽略之、首先與斐聯訂立</p>
<p>互惠商約　於無形中承認其爲獨立自主之國家、菲聯不特領謝吾國之盛意、將再進而認吾國爲良友、吾僑亦蒙政府莫大之恩惠、因互惠商的、實爲拯救吾僑於水深火熱之唯一方法也、在菲聯之工商業迅速發展中、已漸露生產過剩之趨勢、菲政府正在積極尋求海外市塲、我國與菲聯未來之商務關係、必有相當之重要、故爲解除我僑之痛苦、與增進中菲貿易之計、深望政府能迅速遣派有名之外交大員、來菲與菲聯進行商的或協定、以謀吾僑之根本解放、如能達此目的、固爲吾僑之所至望、否則亦須遣派外交大員、與菲聯談判、華僑之居住與營業問題、務求解决、最低限度、亦務使吾僑得有自由營業與居住之權利也、僑等之所以懇求政府、另派外交大員來斐辦理此項交涉者、實因領事之權力有限、不足勝此巨任、蓋因領事祗商務官、而非外交官、此項重大外交任務、非領事官所能辦理者也、懇切陳情、伏維豐察、</p>

<h3>英文報桐油恐慌論　德海通社聲明</h3>
<p>國民新聞社二十五、十一、二十九日、本埠消息、國民新聞社德國海通社東方經理符原斯、前爲德日締結軍事同盟之無稽，已辭而闢之、今見本埠某英文報、又載德國與中國及「滿洲國」又成立一種交換貨物之恊定、特再聲明如次、</p>
<p>本埠某英文報所載者、係以「桐油恐慌爲題、其大意略謂、「中德兩國交換貨物恊定，與在政府保護下計劃設立之中國桐油專賣問題、有若何關連之處、世界市塲、對於中國桐油之需要、增漲極速、實行專賣後、將使此蒸蒸日上之貿易、受有重大打擊、實際上中國現已執有桐油之世界專賣權、但其他國家、現已有從事於栽植桐樹之試騐工作者、一旦情勢變遷、或者緬甸·南美·甚至蘇俄各地、亦將繼起而爲桐油之供給者、如此、則中國將永遠被擯於市塲之外、中國輸出之桐油、英國購去全部百分之十六、美國則佔全部百分之七十一、此兩强國、對於中國之好意、將因桐油專賣、而陷於危險境地、」等語、該英文報同時更於顯著篇幅刋載特的記者一文、亦如速日某數種報紙之所爲、警告中國、愼防德國、該文並論及桐油問題、以英美商業利益、將因桐油專賣、重受危害、爲其全文要旨、並爲鼓動興趣起見、復對德國加以醜詆謂德與日本訂有交換軍火之恊定、德國整備軍備、業已完竣、擬將其所存陳舊軍械火藥、以貨物交換方式、給予日本云云、該文著者更稱、前有德國軍火洪給粤省當局之舉、此乃德日兩國軍部密切合作上之一種新志趣等語、</p>
<p>茲釗於該報社論、及所謂某特的記者之文、答復如次、該兩文之作、純係出於商業競爭之動機、此可、由共字裏行間、一覽無遺、否則、德國購買桐油之舉、與各項捕風從影、厚誣德國之無稽讕言、實際上並無牽連處之必要也、茲先就桐油而言、吾人首須明晰者、卽中國實業部長、前曾明白公布、中國絕不擬以任何方法、阻礙桐油之自由貿易是也、某英報社論中、旣附有統計數字、指明中國桐油之出口、於一年之中、增加六倍、而又稱英美兩國之桐油貿易、將被危及、事理上不啻自相矛盾、難圓其說、蓋此正足以證明中國桐油之出產額、隨其需要而日漸增加、且亦將繼續更行增加也、中國爲其新興事業、招徠顧主、縱使所得顧主、正爲某某數方所惋惜而指爲德國者、中國當亦不願交臂失之、雖某方以危詞聳聽、謂供給德國以大量桐油、將招致惡劣後果、然此項混淆、亦徒心勞日拙、蓋南京當局、終不能任人干涉中國內部之商務事件也、使人更感興趣者、卽該文中、有其他各國已有從事培植桐柏之試騐、並在相當情形下、緬甸·南美·及蘇俄·各地、將繼起而爲桐油之供給者、中國將被擯諸市塲之外、等陳述、吾人應知、英屬緬甸、如果現已從事培植桐樹之試騐者，則其目的、係企圖於最短期間、得將英國所需輸入之桐油、由其本國屬地、自行供給、至於美國、則與南美諸國間之商務關係、向極密切、南美旣從事栽植桐樹、運費上已較由華運輸低廉、則美國之樂觀厥成、亦勢所必然·以上數點、更可證明、中國爲籌謀防止失去其新興事業桐油顧主起見、今日已迫切需要、尋獲新大顧主、反之、中國如果誤信近來挑撥之詞、而拒德國爲桐油之大顧主者、則中國豈非於英美自能供給之後、亦將失去德國爲其桐油之顧主乎、營業必賴競爭而始得進展、中國營業、何獨不然、該英報特的記者之文中、謂德國以陳舊軍械給予日本、可謂向壁虛造、獨出心裁、試思日本工資之低廉、不論任何新時代之軍用物品、日本可以德國所需成本之一部分、儘量製造其所需之數量、今謂日本欲購買德國陳舊、軍械、母乃幼稚太甚、不値識者一笑、而况凡爾賽條約、不容德國存儲陳舊軍械乎、至該英報特的記者、對於德日兩國軍部所造之攔言、余答之曰、粤省及中央政府、前次意見參商、純屬內政、今據該記者流露之意見、暗示粤人係被人用作所謂德日軍部秘密反對中央當局之工具、余現雖客居中國、對此讕言、厚誣愛國之粤人、敢爲提出抗議、此項顚倒是非之妄言、余認爲有應向中國全國讀者揭佈之必要、俾得以之作例、而盡知反對德國之挑撥文字、係如何荒誕、及如何危險、若干有營業關係之市儈、曾未思及能目覩中國成爲新時代之國家者、乃欲謀使中國陷於孤立、以遂其私、在某某數方、桐油關係者心目中、中國似僅爲若輩爭奪之目的物、彼等並思以不適宜之恫嚇論調、及誣蔑其誠實朋友之手段、使中國就其範圍、卽關於德日軍事同盟等謠言、亦莫不悉爲此輩所造作、蓋彼輩目覩商業上之競爭者、及此桐油之大顧主勢力日趨强力、乃不惜以虛偽讕言、思有以中傷之也、</p>

<h3>曁南球運欠佳　四比三敗於葡萄牙　上半時以零比二落後</h3>
<p>方興未艾之暨南隊、昨與葡萄牙作甲組第一循環之最後一賽於申園、葡軍自出師以來、屢遭敗績、全軍將師、亦僅仗柯拉沙恩達耶兩人支持大局、事前預測、暨南希望甚大、交鋒後、暨南極盡厥職、無如球神無靈、到手佳機、盡失交臂、上半時遂以二比〇落後、再戰後、暨南雖迎日而戰、但士氣極爲奮發、連續命中三球、但柯拉沙昨日祖任中鋒職務、與恩達耶聯絡甚佳、仍被柯射中兩只、致以四比三敗績、昨賽暨南戰績、實較以前數决爲佳、結果仍遭敗績、可稱非戰之罪、雙方列陣如下、</p>

<p>顏連進　陳鎭祥　張白元</p>
<p>王南珍　劉始讚　石永楠　伍樹芬　陳明澤</p>
<p>敵勢囂張</p>
<p>銀角一鳴、戰鬥開始、葡軍先聲奪人、大舉進犯、暨南兵衛森嚴、拒之門外、回師返攻、王南珍左路頒兵、石永楠中軍接應、無功而返、柯拉沙蠻勁大　、親師三軍、伐吾邊境、蘇若遠傳得法、柯拉沙舉足攻門、一射中的、葉培初徒嘆奈何、時距開賽僅十餘分鐘、暨南旣被小挫、將士傷心、誰知禍不單行、葡軍正在猛攻之際、關枝揚手觸被罰十三碼、柯拉沙主踢、强弩射出、營門大開、營救無及再失一城、暨南奇恥大辱、失地愈多、全師用命、同心抗敵、殺至敵營門首、石永楠得一良機猛射、球越門而過、全塲無不惋惜、葡軍形勢日盛、居然在吾陣內、耀武揚威、石維亞翻身遙射、峻如砲彈、葉培初捨死忘生、竭力抱住、未肇大禍、逾時、上半時屆、暫告休息、</p>
<p>收復失地</p>
<p>檸檬時過、葡軍聲勢不减、鐵騎縱橫、時在吾後方騷動、柯拉沙偶得路泊士之接應、直叩門下、葉培初見勢不佳、飛步衝出搶救、而柯則態度從容、輕輕一撥、球滾滾入網、暨南諸將無不目瞪口呆、凈輸三只之後、暨南並未完全絕望、前鋒按步就班、進襲敵寨、敵人得意之餘、方可勝利、不圖石、永楠奇兵突起、安渡難關、忙裏偷閒、舉足猛踢、柯倫士大意失愼、擋救無及、球直進門中、吾軍歡聲四起、如服興奮之劑、葡軍銳氣一挫、吾軍遂得大肆活動、不移時敵人營幕、又受吾重重包圍、伍樹芬躍過險地、方擬前進、雷米迪救球心切、手觸阿斗、執法官定罰十二碼、石永楠不慌不忙、對準一脚、巧中紅心、暨南追成二比三、</p>
<p>終遭敗績</p>
<p>暨南連連得彩、愈戰愈勇、劉始讚得王南珍臂助、單闖敵鬥、强弩猛發、葡軍臥地撲空、惜脚頭欠準、未得其門而入、自後七八分鐘暨南攻勢甚盛、球時在葡軍門首徘徊、陳明澤伍樹芬石永楠屢攻得射門之機、惟切以命運不佳、或脚頭欠準、或被門抱出、斯時葡軍見勢不佳、前綫五鋒、出死力進攻、柯拉沙智勇變全、接得來球後、匹馬單槍、向吾腹地而行、至相當地位、卽猛力遙射、球中門柱、彈人網內、石永楠亦不肯甘心、效柯之法、獨騎攻打、一脚開去、球亦中門柱、惟並未彈入網內、大衆無不搖頭、俄而劉始讚東山再起、得王南珍之傳遞、攻門得法、球直進網中、時離時間終了僅數分鐘、暨南方擬再出死力、收回失地、不意銀角長鳴、祗得以三比四見屈、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （鐵吾）</p>
<p>見敵人對自己過來，而膽「戰」心驚的是懦夫；見敵人來壓迫自己，而挺身作「戰」的是勇士；當心啊！這同樣的一個「戰」字！</p>
<p>化盡畢生精力在愛人身上，結果還常常鬧着失戀的慘劇國假如把這精力移到愛國工作上去，那國家絕不會使你失戀的。</p>
<p>「英雄氣短，兒女情長。」我希望在這全國大抗戰的開始，多產生幾位不戀戀於兒女之情的眞正英雄。</p>
<p>剔除了眸子上的世俗網，回復了天眞的視力以後，發現人與人之間的一切，皆是虛僞詭詐。</p>
<p>處在惡劣環境中的靑年，能不爲習俗轉移，仍持身淸潔，那確是「時代英雄。」</p>
<h3>不藉泥土的種植</h3>
<p>— 裴銘</p>
<p>我國有句俗語：「萬物土王中生」；道句數千年來一定不易話，最近居然也打破了。</p>
<p>有兩個英國人，一名哈斯丁湯麥士（A．Hastings-Thcmas），一名達許華（V．C．Deshwood），經四載半之探究，業已發明不藉泥土而同樣能種植家畜飼料的方法，這一發明也許會革新從古至今的種植法。在這發明宣佈後半個月之內，全英國便將有二十處機關設立，皆由鄕村公會農學專家管理，他們唯一的使命便是對農民解釋這新的種植方法底簡便。</p>
<p>這兩位發明者說，在他們這新方法的施行之下，一畝面積的產量可相等於一千七百六十畝普通草地的產量；價値六便士的種子能產出重二十四萬磅的飼料；一天的收獲量可抵同樣大小在普通草地上一整年的收獲量；一個農夫不用乾草或靑草，而以這種新方法產出的穀類飼家畜，那麽，在飼料的消費方面，一隻豬自養出至賣出爲止，的可以省却十一二元左右，一隻牛的可省十八元至二十元左右，而牛乳則能比飼乾草等飼料時增加百分之十五到二十；並且無論何種家畜飼以此種新法種植的穀類，它們的軀體還能更健壯，因爲它們吃的是嫩而新鮮的東西，不是那種缺乏維太命的乾老的飼料。</p>
<p>最近，這新種植法的手續等等都在倫敦宣佈說明了。這兩個發明者自稱這種新法種植呌「小室種植法」；在室裏面放的是一行行的盤子，就在道盤子裏，今天放下種子，明天便都有白茅生長出來，於是一天大似一天的生長，至第十天，所有的飼料便已全都長足了，只等拿出去飼家畜。裏面沒有一些泥土；在小室的頂上裝一滿充着水的扁箱子，水裏含有少許化學的溶液，這溶液的原素也就是泥土的原素，而它的代價也很便宜，一個普通農夫每月費十數元，便可購得這種足够一月應用的溶液。</p>
<p>在那貯水的箱底有無數小空，每三分鐘開放一下龍頭，箱中的水就落下洒在盤子裏；一到第十天，盤子裏的植物就可以拿出來了，跟在靑草地上生長出來的絲毫無異，所不同的便是這些飼料自始至終不染一些泥土或汚穢。</p>
<p>用這種急速生長出來的飼料飼家畜後，這些家畜也可以養在庭園裏或穀庫裏，並且吃了這種易於消化的嫩草，便不必冉用糕餅之類的其他東西飼牠們了。假如有那個農夫要採用這種新種植法，那麽，他定得騰出一塊空地來，國積其他東西，因爲這種種植法顯而易見的並不是限於只能種植家畜飼料，其他如蔬菜之類等，當然也能同樣迅速地產生出來。</p>
<h3>孩子話</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>「父兄們是子弟們的監察入，」大家都這麽說。可是，不對！子弟們纔是父兄們的監察人哩！你們跟着年齡的增加，逐漸地脫離了你們父兄的監察，進躋於你們自己做父兄的地位；到這時候，你們也想引導着你們的子弟入於正軌。恐防你們自己一個大意，或許有失檢的行爲給子弟們學了樣去，於是你們不得不步步留神着你們自己日常的言行，至於一顰一笑，或其他小動作之間，使得無形地資爲遵式。這麽着，不是那子弟們更高一層地正在做着他們父兄的監察人麽？所以，家有子弟，你在精神監督之下易於勉爲完人。家有可以琢磨的佳子弟，逼着你自動地樂與爲善，此樂更勝於家有賢父兄！</p>
<p>家裏有了孩子，你們對於夫婦的愛情會得不衰不廢，對於親長的敬意會得無疑無倦，對於生活的前途會得再接再厲，對於一切都有了意義，孩子們眞是家庭間的活寳！再者，與其養活一隻好玩的狗，爲什麽不養活一個更有偉大的將來的孩子？</p>
<p>爲什麽你要厭憎，或者有時，或者特別地對於某個——別人家的孩子？有沒有這個情形，你？如其有之，請你報告出你的情由。</p>
<p>不是你總覺得你的那個孩子可愛，比了別人家的孩子格外可愛麽？說是溺愛，當然你是要否認的。不過，「鬁鬁頭的兒子，自己的好，」也是人之常情。實在你和你自己的孩子接觸較多，人類的同情心和天性的慈愛打成一片正不足怪。要是這個理解還不够引起你會心的微笑，那麽，還是請你宣佈一下儘你自己可以滿意的話路；無論如何，想來有孩子的人們决不會取笑於你的。</p>
<h3>黑色牆壁</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>吾們地方上，以前房屋的牆壁，都是用石灰來粉飾的，所以沒有一處不是雪白的；你！倘然遠遠裏望去，在太陽光下，或者是天氣陰晦的當兒，倒也未必是十分淸楚，因爲白的顏色，本可以使人色盲，而且爲之眩；現在呢了據說：這種白白的墻壁，是不行了，爲什麽緣故呢？在國難嚴重的時候，不可以不防敵機的飛來，如其一旦天空的鐵鳥，軋軋機聲，在頭頂上掠過，保不住要拿炸彈像雨一般擲下，那末：豈不是立刻化爲焦土麽？因爲道一來，就是想出避免的法兒，第一步，居民如其要保全自己的住所，不至被敵人當作目標，所有的墻壁，不能不使白的顏色，改變黑的頗色爲好了。</p>
<p>故近幾日來，無論大街小巷，統通變成了黑色的墻壁，而一時泥水匠，大忙而特忙，幾乎應接不暇，尤其是一種黑色的原料，呌「靑灰」和「牛皮膠」兩樣東西，也都因是而賣完，石灰行裏的老闆，眞也想不到，在不景氣的市况卜，有了這一回利市三倍的生　經；於是遂提高價格，而門市還求過於供，眼前竟會缺貨，慢一些就買不到手，這也是從未有過的一種怪象；而且有幾處新造的西式房屋，自然墻壁都是帶些黃色的，屋面因爲用了機器做瓦筒，也都是帶些紅色的，脖！不料看見大家拿白壁墻刷了烏黑，也趕緊馬上變了顏色，有人說：就呌是「黑化」，這一句話，驟然聽起來，像煞不好算他不是幽默的調兒。</p>
<p>但是也有人說：白的墻壁，變成了黑色，不過遮避敵人的眼光，原是無法的極思，眞的轟炸起來，須要曉得在飛機上駕駛的人們，恐怕瞧到下層地面上，不會糊塗，碰然一聲，火花四濺，誰也不能僥倖呢？最好還是個價旣是地方上的人民，要盡匹夫之責的話，唯有放出火熾般赤心，共同想出禦侮的武器來，做自己捍衛的防護物，一來可以拒敵不至侵犯，二來又可以保住身家性命，進一層講，墻壁雖黑，效力總是無幾，一個人的一顆赤心，比較銅墻鐵壁，還要堅强勝過萬倍哩！</p>
<h3>都市的初冬</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>陽光照射在人們的身上，並不覺其可畏，而反覺它和煦可愛，偶不經意吹過一陳風來，會使我瘦弱的軀幹，陡的起了陣輕微的抖顫！啊—這無疑的已由深秋而轉入初冬季節了。</p>
<p>都市中的摩登女郞，雖然伊的玉腿和雙趺，依舊套上絲襪與挖花皮鞋，彷彿與風姨還在作最後的角勝，但伊的嬌軀，却已消失了勇氣，因爲早披上美麗的絨綫衫和新式大衣了。</p>
<p>幾家適合於冬令服用的舖子，從大玻璃的橱窗裏望進去，都已預備齊了各色的貨品，竭誠歡迎各界前去光顧，他們在不久約期間內，更將掛起冬季大廉價，大競賣的旂幟，希冀在量後的季節裏，多做一些營業，在年終結算的時候，縱不能賺錢，但願不致虧損，然而，這最低期望，每家舖子是否都能達到目的？</p>
<p>洋澄湖大蟹，橫行市上以來，老婆已一再嘗厭了，換換口味，還推天津良鄕——果子，——在閃爍的燈光下，他們一邊在炒，一邊在包，更開上無綫電，吸引了不少路人圍觀，靜聆彈詞，歌曲，多麽閒適，順便也有買幾包回去的。</p>
<p>殘酷的冬之神，已降臨到人間，它從不爲貧乏者稍加憐惜的，簫瑟的西風，將陣陣的加緊，寒威漸漸的向他們進逼！可是，那些富有者，祗要提早備辦了滋補品，和禦寒的物品，前去享樂，冬之神却無術施展它的權威吧！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金的指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>友梅說着這話，就把封着金戒指的這個信封，送到國器手上。國器聽了他的話音，雖是已經知這他此來的用意，但是猛可的出之，究竟還摸不着他何以出此，所以頃刻之間，還不能答復他一句話。手裏接了這個信封，却是怔怔的望了他。友梅並不去詳加解說，向他點了一個頭道：我走了。人隨着這話，便已忽忽的走去。國器趕到鬥外來相送，他老遠的回轉頭來，連點了幾下笑道：他會有信給你的，用不着我多說了。國器對於這一層，有覺得有點希奇，在這男女之間，何以會鑽出一個第三者來。趕快回到屋子裏，把信封拆開，等到取出來，看着麩一枚金戒指，好像是種地的人，掘得了一塊金磚，雖然是可喜的事，太來得突然了，自己疑惑是在夢裏頭，不能不發呆了。他左手拿了信封，右手心托住那隻金戒指，只是望着，偶然一抬頭，見墻上所懸的鏡子裏，有一位穿夏布長衫的客人，站在身後，還才知道有客人進來了，立刻轉身對房門口相迎。可是到了房門口，並不看到一個人。自己淸醜過來了，却是週身汗下。哦，原來鏡子裏那人是自己的影子，送客已走，自已還沒有脫下長衫呢。自己發起笑來，把金戒指放在桌上，扭轉身來脫衣服。但是只常扭轉身去，在解紐扣的時候，忽然有悟，兩手在解紐扣，金戒指不在手上了。披着長衫，向地板四處張望，並不見踪影，莫不是落到地板縫裏去了。他皺了兩道眉頭子，只麩這樣是想。出着神，綵緩的轉着向了窗戶這邊，這就看到桌上的洋式信封旁邊，黃潑澄的有一粒金戒指擺着。這不能不說是自己健忘了，素興哈哈大笑起米。　着這笑聲，引起對門屋子裏，母親丙三聲咳嗽。假如這事讓母親知道了，却是不大妥當。這才自己定了一定神，把長衫脫下，將金戒指取在手上，仔細看了一會。放到自己手指上帶時，却只好穿過小拇指。帶戒指的人，不會帶在小指上的，這人的手當然很　小。再看戒指裏，有MN兩個字母，正是夢蘭兩個字的縮寫。（一〇三）</p>
<h3>蘇州審美展覽會第一日</h3>

<p>會塲是假的宮巷樂羣社，我化了四毛錢購了門票進去，有人專責司摸彩的，我也跟他們樣拈卷領贈，居然被我摸到了一份冠生園的糖果，聽說這次蘇滬兩地的各大廠家、捐助了好些東西，所以每券有贈的，第一室是題的「傲霜　」，滿堆的是菊花，色調配得很勻，望去非常美觀，這幾天天氣很寒冷，大都的菜花已就凋謝，他們倒還保護的很好，據說這是東吳大學同公園的出品，第二室題的是「百靈廟」，陳列的許多磁銅古玩，還有是幾件名畫，這裏是幾家古玩鋪來參加陳列的，都是拿的精品出來，內家在賞玩的很擠，有軸宋代周文矩的文會圖，以及陳所翁的魚水圖，淸代石濤和尙的山水，都是眞蹟，三代吉金祭器，亦非常名貴，第三室題的「虎丘」，是蜀人張善子大千昆仲及陶再敏還有一家姓孫的陳列的，在這間的東首的臺上，放一只活的老虎，雙目炯炯，生氣虎虎，確是少見的，據說張氏畫虎，就時時拿它來作寫生，所以更其生動了，居中幾只桌子，全是名種金魚，也頗珍貴，第四室題的是石壑一桌子上拱了有好幾十件的石頭，架以精致的紅木架子，形態各異，玲瓏透貼，搜集恐也非易易，壁間懸元代趙子昻佛像，明代唐伯虎山水，沈石田聽松圖，淸代黃鼎山水，籃由叔山水，錢維城山水，張氏昆仲合作的丈六「十馬圖」，都是眞蹟，是吳中收藏家潘博山，彭恭甫，徐偉士幾位家藏的，第五室題的是覺廬。爲徐覺伯所陳列，各色玉器多件，亦屬價値連城，第六室在會塲最後進，亦卽精華所粹也，此間爲陳迦盦，朱西園，周瘦鵑三家出品，陳据兩桌，列瓶石等件，貼牄懸一幅自繪的松石海滿，筆力遒勁，非常精工，朱氏別署　盦，列東窗一長桌，居中就高拱的那件童，是周末的一件古器，經許多識者考據，名稱　器，又稱嘉子陽白實，張丹翁也大加稱賞過，還在搭本上題有長跋，還有竹根刻的小孤山，松化石，明工刻的碧玉三件，哥窰的尊，這些都是珍貴古董，餘如磁刻的一座白鹿洞，是近代江西景德鎭名刻家陶陶手鐫，精工細巧，眞非拙筆所能描繪了，周氏紫羅蘭盦，獨据四桌，各有題名，一珠瓜珠魚的珍珠顆顆」，一　子植物的「朱實離離」，一菊與紫羅蘭花，一花如解語還多事一，一女神石像，「石不能言最可人」，四桌裝點精巧，匠心獨運，在在有美的結構，精湛恐難匹敵，第七室題的「平地泉」，是倩一家食品公司來承辦茶點的，此外，還有各界捐助下來的許多贈品，亦另外滿儲一室，任人觀覽，物品之多，那就祗好恕我不能一樣樣的寫出來了，聽說這幾　應景的室名，是先一日請名流葉譽虎先生所題署的，益覺名貴可喜，錦上添花了。</p>
<p>記者暢覽一過，擠得汗流，僅能憑記憶所及的寫些下來，其中琳琅滿目，眞是美不勝述，使人有身入其境，心神都快之感了。該會原定二十八日起舉行四天，因爲這幾日上海及各處去參觀的人士頗多，恐依時閉會了，遲到的有空勞往返的，所以，特再延長一天。（本星期三尙有，）滬上雅士，如欲一廣眼界，則此時尙未爲晚哩。</p>

<h3>興業造產之人的問題</h3>
<p>— 端聲</p>
<p>談到中國經濟建設，就要想到興業造產。一談到興業造產，那就要問到怎樣去與造而產業在那裏？產業，敢說中國不會十分窮乏。興造，那非空品白話所能成事，至少必須具備人材與資財兩個條件。中國號稱發展實業近六十載，而沒有多大成效，正爲了這兩個條件不充分。</p>
<p>資財之不足，尚不足慮，有了產業，不怕人不來投資。最末一着，如不顧一切利害，可以儘量的借外資來開發。但是人材的貧乏，眞是可慮，有以爲「有錢萬事行」，有了錢何愁不能做。其實做事不是那麽容易，假如在這樣不健全的前提下去興業，其結果不但是事業辦小好，連金錢也白糟塌了。</p>
<p>中國資金的缺乏，若從各方而觀察一下，不足，是無庸諱言的。但如果各人傾囊而出，以幅員之廣，人口之衆，恐亦不在少數。內地鄉問稍有資力的人，其所有之現金，不出以下的幾項去路：</p>
<p>（一）置田地房產，但以連年經濟凋敝之結果，房屋儘多空關，田地收租不易，最不幸之結果，或須賠貼田賦。</p>
<p>（二）貸放利息固然好，但放了出去，往往不易收轉。而且錢債官司沒有打頭。爲了食圖高利息，連本錢都撈不回來。</p>
<p>（三）因之，不移存於都市之銀行，卽死藏於家中。可是都市的銀行或許不便，或許有顧慮，在目前說不定還以窖藏的居多。</p>
<p>至於都市有資力的人們，當然比之鄉間較爲集中。但其去路不出下列三項：一房地產，（二）工商業，（三）存欵證券。雖此三項投資之數字，未有確切可恃之統計可據。　在早年，房地產的投資，當然不少。工商業投資理應居大宗，不至在近幾年環境之中，至多能維持現狀，已算幸事，說不定有在緊縮之中。那末在此種情况下，資金的出路，常然集中於銀行存欵及證券買賣的兩門了。</p>
<p>故要談到興業和造產，至小限度，要將資金運用到工商業去，才有希望。但如何可使資力集中於工商業或其他實業，用以興業造產呢？吾以爲最起碼的條件，要有三點，其他姑月不去細說。</p>
<p>目下之高談建設，有時太過於抽象的理論。而缺乏具體的條件，故儘說發展工商業，而工商業之不發展如故。雖則造產興業，需要經濟的條件，亦需要政治的條件，而吾之所謂最起碼的條件，單單就人的問題一個條件去說。而經濟政治自亦有連帶包括在內。</p>
<p>（一）組織不健全這不是一句老生常談麼？其實組織之不健全，正爲無組織之人材。公司事業，是大企業發展之途徑，而我中國行之近五十年，猶未收大成效，非公司制度之不善，而爲經營人材之不盡咸宜。照公司法及商人通例所規定，董事爲公司之最高級職員，依據公司章程及股東會之决議而行使其職務。惟恐董事有所不週，另　監察人，隨時調查公司財務狀况查核簿冊文件並請求董事報告公司業務情形，立法不爲不周。而經理則主持營業塲所之事務，雖受董事（工商業主人）之監督指導，職權亦不爲不明。可是有不少公司的董事會形同虎設，監察人袖手旁觀，因之一公司之盛衰，繫於經理之一人。經理若公正賢能，尚不至於十分失敗，否則不是一塌糊塗，卽將事業成爲經理個人的私產。固然董事監察要負其責任，而且董事監察必是占有股分較多的人，不應如是草率，正爲有左列原因之故：</p>
<p>（一）董監從股東中產生，因之有財力奢未必有才能，一朝當選，實亦無從行使其　權。至數字之不能盡讀，資產負責內容之不能明瞭尤其决也。</p>
<p>（二）現在流行之量監選擇，採用名望，地位主義。因之在社會上名望地位較大者，各大公司中幾無一不有其董事之地位。試問此等董事，卽便精明榦濟，才具超衆，並有如龍似虎之精力，亦恐無此時間，顧問其所董之公司。</p>
<p>（三）開會之際，但憑經理之報告，以其茫然不知公司業務情形之爲何如，經　曰是則亦是之，經理曰吾，則亦吾之，幾成爲經理之愧儡，致有　董事不懂事」之譏評。及一朝公司失敗，不能免除刑責，是亦可知董事名義之不可濫居。　以公司之最高機關，而　不健全如是，無怪公司事業不能有長足之進步。</p>
<p>（二）人材不利用有資力者未必有其才，有才能者未必有其資，此爲習見之事。而現在之爲公司重員者，因其目光·見解·存心·之不同，所任用者不靈皆材，甚至私心重者嫉賢忌能，成見深者不知改進。中國大部分公司事業不能迎合時代潮流以俱進，喜以舊時情况相比擬，視爲金科玉律，事業永不會有科學化之一日。卽求其井幷有條，組織釐明，亦不可多覯。事業之失敗，自無可避免。</p>
<p>勞資不協調一般有資力者不敢投於工商事業，工潮亦爲其顧慮之一。以爲一朝事業發達，深慮工潮隨之，難以應付。其實在昔視勞工若厮役，固所不該；近則奉之若神聖，亦覺過分。吾人以爲中國如果要復興經濟，必需興業造產，而興業造產，必先之以勞資協調。蓋無產業則無勞資，無勞資亦無產業，勞資與產業，固處於同等之地位，理應如指臂之相助。然而互相齮齕，或日恃衆退强，不守紀律，不服管理，又不能謂爲絕無。而工作效率之强弱，與服務之道德精神，成正比例。守紀律，盡本分，則其工作之成續必佳。近來工人於此等處不無欠缺，遂爲人所詬病，以爲工資增加，而工作退步，事實之有無姑不論，要之，在力圖振興產業之時代，工紀之良惡，與產業前途至有關係。斷不可以職工衆多，對其應盡之本分，應守之紀律，曲爲寬恕。蓋旣在私有資本制度之卜，不能不重視投資者之利潤，亦不能不注意勞務者血汗換來之酬報。故於此後紀律之推行，自應加以深切之注意：而於生產利潤之分配，亦當有公允精審之辦法。</p>
<p>上述三者，雖不能盡興業造產之能事，但能秉此以求實現，則投資於實業，當不致如目前之遲疑。</p>
<h3>硜斯貨幣論的要義及批評</h3>
<p>— 吳小甫</p>
<p>（一）硜斯貨幣論的要義</p>
<p>英國硜斯（J.M.Keynes）提倡通貨管理論，影響很大，只是在我國尚不大見有何簡要的介紹，和嚴格的批判；本篇的任務，便是要將硜斯所著的貨幣論（A　Treatise　on　Money）之大旨簡要的介紹一下，並且加以小小的批判。</p>
<p>硜斯貨幣論的中心思想，是：物價之擾亂，起於儲蓄與投　間的均衡之破壞；故欲安定物價（當然，理斯的意思是要將物價安定於較高的水準，）必須恢復這個均衡，使　僩均衡，維持下去。硜斯看到，物價的安定，須以國內備蓄額與投資額相等爲唯一條件：貨幣購買力的穩定，須以儲蓄額與條正的投資成本相等爲唯一條件。硿斯是要求恢復價格與生產費間的平衡的。他說：爲要達到此種目的，非運用通貨管理政策不可。</p>
<p>管理貨幣（Managed　Money）在硜期的眼中是一菰最適合時代需要的貨幣制度。他以爲如果要穩定貨幣的購買力，則需要生產費不變動，需要資本貨（Capital　Goods，卽生產手段）的生產費，等於儲蓄額。但是怎樣才能够使它們相等呢？主要的惟有運用銀行利率政策和公開市塲政策。（硜斯並且建議了隨時變更普通銀行存欵準備比率的政策。）他說銀行利率的高下，能够影響資本貨的價格；因爲利奉之高低，與貨幣之產業的資本化的稈度，成反比例。假使資本化的收入不如利息所給予的進益大，則貨幣資本家必售去證券而轉向儲蓄。反之，如果資本化的收入較利良所給予的利益大，則儲蓄存欺會轉化爲證劵投資。這是投資與儲蓄的密切關聯。所以硜斯認需運用銀行利率政策，能够調節投資與儲蓄，恢復二者間的均衡。因爲利率的高下，影響資本貨的價格，而資本貨生產額之增减，又影響到消費貨的價格。</p>
<p>硜斯看到，如果儲蓄超過投資，則企業家受損失，經濟卽形衰落。所以在硜斯看來，信用之張縮適中，與經濟之吾泰，是有着至爲密切的關係的。</p>
<p>山於管理通貨與金木位直接對立之故，硜斯是反對金本位的。他以爲在國際性的金本位制之下，運用銀行利率政策，只能維持對外的平衡；不但不能同時維持對內的平衡，並且還須犧牲了對內的平衡，然後才能獲得對外的平衡。所以爲了保持自國的利益，非放棄金本位，採用通貨管理制不可。</p>
<p>關於物價，硜斯在表面上好像是立在貨幣數量說與生產過剩論的中間。但同時他却又以爲銀行能够操縱通貨數量，左右投資與儲蓄的　額，因而銀行能够影響，乃至按制物價水準，振興工商業，招致景氣的到來。</p>
<p>以上是硜斯貨幣論的中心思想。</p>
<p>（二）硁斯貨幣論的批判</p>
<p>現在我們來對硜斯貨幣論作一個小小的批判。</p>
<p>先從理論方面批判之。</p>
<p>當然，由於英國具有金融組織及其他各方面的有利條件，中央銀行運用利率等政策以施行經濟與通貨的統制，（通貨管理麩經濟統制的一個最大設施，其影響是很大的，而且也有某些效果。藉通貨管理制的運用，英國的銀行與信用制度已更見安定，金鎊亦賴以漸歸穩定了。　是通貨管理制所帮助實現的。不過我們對於複雜　端的此會經濟問題，若只以鑽牛角尖的眼光去觀察，那是不行的。</p>
<p>不用說，硜斯所提倡的通貨管理論之最大目的，在於安定物價於一較高的水準，（事實上對於廠主，物價越高越好，所謂較高，恐怕在硜斯的眼中是不易固定其程度的）。這原是利潤生產下的中心問題。所有各種合理化運動等等，都是爲了這一點。不過以爲物價之擾亂與降落，是起於投資與儲蓄的失却均衡，這是不合乎事實的。因爲我們很可以這樣的追問一下；投資與儲蓄又爲什麽會失却鈞衡呢？如果說儲蓄與投資的失却均衡是由於物價的擾亂，那麽！我們便陷入循環論設的泥沼，究實不知是鷄先生蛋還是蛋先生鷄了。</p>
<p>我們知道，物價的擾亂這個毛病，是先天的，到了時候是一定要爆發的。這種爆發，大致上取着周期的形勢，而一次厲害一决，（在總趨勢上是如此）。價値與價格的下降，更有其自然的傾向；這是資本有機構成日益增高，技術日益進步，生產日趨社會化而佔有日趨寡頭化，——總之，這是盲目的生產下生產與消費日益脫離平衡的結果。所以物價的優亂與降落這一問題，實際上是生產與消費不平衡的問題，而不是儲蓄與投資不平衡的問題。</p>
<p>不僅物價的擾亂與下落是由於生產與消費的不平衝，卽儲　與投資的不平衡亦是由此。物價的擾亂與儲蓄和投資的平衡之破壞，可說是一種伴侶現象。二者是互相促進，互相影響着的；但在起源上，前者是後者的原因，並非後者是前者的原因；因爲資本找不到利潤或滿意的利潤時，勢必紛紛轉向儲蓄生利。硜斯反把儲蓄與投資的不平衡當作物價擾亂的原因，這是其顚倒因果的另一點。</p>
<p>再，在盲目的生產下，物價的擾亂以及儲蓄與投資的不平衡，是物價回到安定（一時的）與儲蓄和投資　到平衡（一時的）一個必經之途。不過，如上所示，擾亂與均衡的破壞，在總趨勢上一决厲害一决。一九二九年起的經濟恐慌，便是資本制史上已見的一次最兇險的表現。在此種物價擾亂與儲蓄和投資均衡的破壞前面，所有的貨幣政策，只能藉以向國內大衆及殖民地人民多加搾取，以及帮助軍火工業與公共工程等等造成畸形景氣，延綏並加深危機罷了。</p>
<p>關於貨幣貨量說，硿斯雖表示不大信任此說，但實質上他並沒有離開數量說的窠臼。硜斯主張以利率政策和公開市塲政策來維持投資與儲蓄的均衡，試問利率政策是不是脫胎於甚且完全依據於貨幣數量說？</p>
<p>我們現在再由事實方面對經氏的學說給予一些些評價。</p>
<p>硜斯管理通貨的實際意義是有限膨脹。所有貶去幣値，脫離金本位，膨脹信用等等，均是這一點的表現。由於脫離金本位，貶去幣値，進行對外的匯兌戰爭，努力擴大其鎊團的勢力，英國最近二·三年來在輸出地位上確實有了相當的改進。試看數目字：</p>
<p>英國近年輸出額（單位百萬鎊，月平均）（註）</p>
<p>年別</p>
<p>一九三一——三一·五五</p>
<p>一九三二——三〇·四二</p>
<p>一九三二——三〇·一六</p>
<p>一九三四——三三·〇〇</p>
<p>一九一五——三五·四九</p>
<p>再看一看英鎊近年遠離金平價的程度：英鎊貶値的發展（一九二九——一〇〇）（註二）</p>
<p>年別　九三三——六八·一</p>
<p>一九一——九三·二　一九四——六一·八</p>
<p>一九三一——七二·〇　一九三——九·八</p>
<p>據此二表看來，英國輸出的增加，是大大的依賴了英鎊之遂步貶値。</p>
<p>這便是通貨管理制的另一眞面目：盡量貶値以從事對外的爭奪，對殖民地的榨取。此種貨幣政策，在對外方面，原來只是加强『由壟斷的資本主義變為國家的壟斷資本主義的過程』的一個有力武器。現在，英鎊的威力不但節罩，不列顚帝國全部，並且打入斯千的那維亞，南美諸國及其他了。然而通貨管理制在對外方而所起的這種作用，只是會助使世界經濟或遲或早陷於更大的危境，因而英國亦會終於不能單獨無恙。像這樣，還能够談什麽物價的穩定嗎？</p>
<p>英國通貨管理制開始實行時，正是英國經濟即將好轉的常兒。自然，此種貨幣政策對於生產是給予了一些刺激；但是英國近年生產之增加，主要的還得力於兩個其他的因素：軍火工業與公共工程（包括建築）。試看數目字：</p>
<p>英國近年的生產指數（一九二九——一〇〇）（註三）</p>
<p>此一種指數告訴找們，英國近年生產指數之增高，大半由於軍備工業和公共工程之興盛，因爲鋼鐵業生產亦甚進步（表繁未能盡列）；汽車業亦有不小的發展；只是煤的生產與織物的生產却是進步得很有限。於此我們可得一觀察，現在英國的各生產部門的增進是很畸形的；而向來處於重要地位的織物和煤業現在父比較的很是請索；細細考究，我們卽可知凡與軍備工業和公共工程有直接間接的關係的，均有迅速的進步，其他則有些相形見絀了。這不是含有危險種子的假性景氣或火藥景氣是什麽？瓦爾加估量英國新的週期經濟又在成熟（註四），不是沒有根據的。</p>
<p>由此可知英國的貨幣政策並不能使英國經濟眞正的好轉。</p>
<p>英國目前之所以尚見寬裕的，除了上述原因之外，還有每年自海外獲得巨額利息，航業所得等等。目英國對於美債已經數年不理，這對於英國的財政自然也不無小補。還有，英國經濟發展得最有條理，亦非常透澈，工商人口佔全部人口的大多數，故工商業一見活潑（無論是正常的發展或是軍備工業等等的發展），情形便可很快的轉好，與慢性恐慌的農業國是不同的。不過在英國，經濟危機的到來亦是很快的。</p>
<p>所以，遑論英國近年的畸形進步，决非全得力於英國的貨幣政策？縱使英國目前畸形景氣主要係得力於貨幣政策，但是這棟含有危險種子的畸形景氣能够保澄物價安定下去，儲蓄與投資的均衡維持下去嗎？</p>
<p>這是從事實方面對硜斯貨幣論所加的評價。</p>

<h3>論經濟建設的途徑</h3>
<p>— 予夐</p>
<p>經濟建設，嚴格的意義就是增加對於生產事業的投資。所以經濟建設問題，吾人完全可把他當成一個投資問題來討論。如今所當硏究的只有如何增加國民對於生產事業的投資。在解答這個問題前，吾人應該分析一决定投資數量的各種因素。</p>
<p>Keyrles最近出了The　General　Theory　ofEmployment　Money　and　Interstl書，他認爲决定投資的數量，有二個基本的條件，一個是資本的界限效率，（Marginal　Efficiency　of　Capital）一個是利率，（Rate　of　Interest資本的界限效率，就是一切關於生產前途有無利益可求的心理作用的總稱。例如政治安定，物價上升，資本家對於生產滿抱樂觀，他們都有獲利的希望（Expectation　to　Yield　）那嗎資本的界限效率增大，生產投資，亦隨之增加，產業繁榮。物資和人力，都向充分利用的路上走）Whole　Enployment）。在另一方面，假如利率減低，生產利得的希望亦可增大，投資數量亦可增加，物資和人力亦可充分的利用。反之，皆可使投資者發生懹疑，投資數量減少，產業衰收，失業增加，走向恐慌的道路。Keynes的說法，確較一般爲進步。吾人旣服膺Keynes的話，認定决定投資數量的因子，基本的共有二個，一是產　界對於生產前途的希望，一是生產資金利率的高低。茲據此兩點，一看國內投資事業的前途。</p>
<p>自從去年十一日幣制改革以後，國內物價上漲，生產者對於生產前途的希望增大，卽是資本的界限效率增高，這似是引起國人增加生產投資的一種力量。同時自改革幣制時起，一般放欵利率，亦已略爲降低，這似乎也是增加投資數量的一種動力。但是，國際形勢的緊張，戰爭危機的威脅，却使生產界對於生產的前途，完全失去了信心，資本的界限效率因政冶的關係而格外的降低，在這種情形之下，利息率雖已相常低落，亦難引起產業界增加投資走希望和興趣。道事實是很顯明的。現在產業界敢於放膽擴張生產的實居少數，問他們的原因，都說是局面不定，不敢放手做去，有些敢於購置生產工具，擴充生產的，據說是一種以身作則的冒險，聊盡人力，前途如何，在所不計。但所謂冒險，到底只是產業界中有勇氣的人的一種偶然舉動，民族產業，是不能在冒險的心理中述築起來的。再從銀行界的放欵方面看，同樣的感受國際危機的威脅，長期的資金融通，還是和從前一樣困難，縱使偶而有長期資余的接濟，他們亦都自認說這是一種冒險，在戰爭威脅之下，要銀行界放膽接濟產業界，那是不可能的。在目前這種非常局面之下，Marginal　Efficiency　of　Capital可說是已經降低到零度，縱然利率稍低，亦難誘發大量的投資，這是事實所告訴我們的。</p>
<p>吾人認爲在對外關係變幻不定的情形之下，要誘發大量的投資，是不可能的，國外政治勢力的壓迫，實實在在是民族工業興起量大的一種阻力。這種阻力，要把他除去，似乎是不可能的，而我們民族經濟建設的目的，就是在除去這種阻力，因此出現了民族產業發展上的一種矛盾局面，那就是：民族產業不能發展，則國力不能充實，永遠沒有解除外力壓迫的力量；吾人要發展民族產業，充實解放的力量，則國外的壓力，又使產業的發展爲不可能。目前的民族經濟建設，就窒塞在這條矛盾的路上。</p>
<p>有許多人以爲私人的投資雖然因爲國際關係的不定，不能大量的增加，但政府的努力建設，便可以代替人民的努力。但吾人認爲這是把政府的力量估價過高，把人民經濟原則下的貢獻，過分忽視。吾人且看一下事實。截至目前止，政府的建設所可告人的，一是鐵路的增築，二是公路的興修，三是水利的開發。但所謂鐵路公路水利等，只是造成一種有利的環境，使經濟事業生產事業可以發展，這些項目，只是便利經濟發展的手段，並不是生產事業的本身。我們不能利用火車路製造衣服，不能利用汽車道製造日用品，這是很顯然的，在沒有生產事業的情形之下，交通工具是會失掉效用的。截至現在止，政府並未直接的創設棉織廠，麵粉廠，農具製造廠，及其他一切直接從事於生產的事業。所以所謂民族產業，事實上還是以私人投資　產業爲中堅。幾年來的交通水利建設，吾人只能認爲政府努力造成一種環境，間接的使生產事業可以發展，他本身並未參加直接生產的活動，而最重要的一點，是在使私人投資的直接牛產事業可以發展。如果把民挨經濟的建設看成一個建築鐵路和修闢公路的問題，那是誤解了國民經濟建設意義的全面。民族經濟建設的前途，還是要從國民投資的直接生產事業上去觀察。</p>
<p>在國際關係不定的威脅之下，國人不敢放胆投資，就是說民族產業的興起　不可能。但我們爲救亡圖存計，又不得不使產業興起，吾人當前的問題，就在如何解决這種矛盾。</p>
<p>目前問題的癥結就是國內銀行界和產業不敢充分的投資於生產事業。吾人所要硏究之點，就是如何在國際關係不定的情形之下，使國內的生產投資得以擴大。人民對於投資前途的心理作用，是無法控制的，卽是MarginalEfficiency　of　Capital是不能用法令或人力輕易回復過來的，Keynes自己亦認爲這是無法控制的因子。要人民自動的增加投資，似乎是很不可能。因此，吾人不得不從　他方面，找尋補救的辦法。</p>
<p>在目前，吾人認爲多言無用，理想太高亦不行，只有的一條路就是從可能處可行處做起。所以闊大的理論和計畫，吾人認爲可以避免時應該靈量避免，那是無濟於事的。因此吾人僅擬提出一條低而可行的道路，那便是國家政策支撑下國家銀行的擴大投資，並且是低利的投資。這辦法很簡單，他包括二點，其一是國家銀行，——卽是中中交三行，盡量擴大他投資的數額，其二是這種投資，應該是低利的。吾人把他說明如下：</p>
<p>第一中中交三行在投資上的保守，似乎不在一般普通的商業銀行之下，這在國民經濟建設的立塲上，是有絕對的害處的。國家銀行不敢放胆投資，呌誰敢把金錢出來冒險。所以政府應該運用種種催促或保障的力量，使中中交三行，放棄那種政策，放胆的盡量投資，凡可辦應辦或已辦而有相當基礎的生產事業，應即盡量予以資金的接濟。國衆銀行如是，其他銀行，必可響應，投資數量，當可望有普遍的增加，資源和人力，自可逐漸走上充分利用的道路。在這個民族危機千鈞一髮的關頭，吾人絕對不能容忍銀行把生產的資金封鎖在銀行之內，而把大可利用的資源物力和人工，都棄置於無用之途。故吾人建議卽以國家銀行的力量，做開闢風氣的前鋒，雖有些微犧牲，亦在所不惜，我們要看到整個民族的犧牲，較之國家銀行些微利益的犧牲，關係還要大得好多。</p>
<p>第二，國家銀行的投資，應以低利爲條件。Keynes在書中，幾乎以抑低利息爲救濟恐慌的唯一辦法。他認爲在產業界對於投資的前途完全失却信任，卽是Marginal　Efficiency　ofCapital降低，甚至全部崩潰的時候，捨抑低利率，增加投資以爲救濟外，殆別無其他辦法。吾人認爲目前國內的生產界。旣因國際局面的緊張而减少對於投資的興趣，假如我們能够運用國家銀行的力量，把利率大量减低，未始不是一種消極的補救政策。假如放欵利率能够减低一半，那嗎　家的利息負担，亦可减輕一半，自可增强他們擴充產業的興趣。低利是一種政策，引誘廠家作生產或擴張生產的活動是目的。國家銀行旣把利率充分降低，則一般商業銀行，亦不能不把利率减低，因爲假如他仍採像過去一般高利封鎖資金的政策，他會逐漸的被推到角落裏去，過那贍養奧蟲或蚊蠅的生活。只要我們的國家銀行負責任，有勇氣，大刀闊斧，不怕一般銀行家蠢守自肥，這是我們的看法。</p>
<p>上面兩點，是否人對於經濟建設的意見，我們已經看慣了「三年計劃」「五年計劃」「十年計劃」一類的東西，我們不相信那是可以兌現的鈔票。所以我們只想提出了一點淺顯的意見，看慣了「計劃」和「綱領」的讀者，或許以爲上面所言淺淡無味，但我人認爲目前不楚空談闊大的計劃的時候。</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實</p>
<h3>怎樣保持永久的愛情</h3>
<p>人的情感極易變遷若無適當的聯繫愛情決雖持久　性愛為男女結合的原動力若能美滿愛河不致生波</p>
<p>人類的感情瞬息萬變，要使其永久地保持原狀，必須具有强有力的聯繫，時時予以充分的刺激，使同樣的情感常常發生；除此外，是在沒有其他方法可用。所以一對夫婦，如果希望永久地保持濃厚的愛情，除卻努力地覓取個適當的聯繫以外，更無其他妙法可從。那麼這個聯繫改該是什麽呢？該用什麽方法去獲得這聯繫呢？</p>
<p>我們只須想一想：那再原始時代使男和女結合起來的原動力是什麽呢？當然就是性生活了。性愛既然是男女結合之基本的原動力，既然是男和女發生愛的潛勢力，自然也可以作為保持愛情的聯繫。從性的歡娛滿足中，愛情不斷地得到新生命。</p>
<p>於是有些人這樣想了：性是人的本能，既然即係愛情的聯繫，那麼世界上根本不會發生愛河風波；而且因為是本能，不必用人為的方法取得。</p>
<p>可是我們要知道：世界上有無數的人，性機能發生了障礙，不能適當地舉行其職務，使對方不滿足。這種人便失卻了愛情的聯繫，需要人為的方法來補救了。</p>
<p>原來有許多男子和女子，在情竇已開，發育未畢的年齡（通常自十五六歲開始），受到外界的誘惑，引起很强烈的慾望，要求著性的滿足。最普通的辦法是手淫，其餘有私通，有同性愛的，總而言之，都是很早的使用著性器。此時，生殖腺極為脆弱，他的內分泌要供給全身發育之用，經你非法地摧殘，生殖腺萎弱不堪，發育停止，全身衰弱。所以在男子則有局部短小，陽痿早洩，遺精等癥候；在女子則有性感冷淡薄弱，月經不調發育不全等癥候。凡患了這種疾病，適當滿足的性生活與之無緣，夫婦愛情受其影響，愛河之中，難免大起風波。這種人要設法獲得此種聯繫，只須趕緊內服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，該劑分男用女用二種分別採用强壯動物的生殖腺素的精華製成，使局部長大，惟遺精須另服『希米脫氏固精片』；『女用生殖素』可根治性感冷淡，調整月經，發育乳峯，增進健康。可說是維繫夫婦愛情的武器。</p>

<h3>治療淋病之心得</h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>娼妓制度存在的今日，淋病的傳佈既速且廣，已為不可談言的事實。然而因其為有礙名譽的惡疾，許多患者恒不願公然求醫，而自行服藥嘗試；即登醫師者之門，無不希望以最簡單的方法，於最短期間根治。繁複不堪的注射洗滌，很難使病家歡迎，甚至因此而使疾病遲延不治的亦不乏人。這是我治療淋病多年，所觀察得來的病人心理。</p>
<p>醫者固不能專事投合病家心理以圖取巧，然若有可靠確實的簡易療法可從，那又何必把注射等手術去麻煩病人。所以近幾年來，我常用一種黃色和伐克的合製劑，四做『安敵淋』的內服藥，得到了很大的效果。</p>
<p>本來治療淋病，方法不外於殺菌，因為專門殺菌，恐有餘毒向內部傳播，所以又有抗毒一法。黃色素是殺菌的專藥，伐克辛則能使血液中產生抗毒素。一向習用的注射療法亦以此二者為特效藥品，現在把他們合製為內服藥，應用起來非常便利；而且因係二藥的合製劑，殺菌抗毒兩大作用，同時並進，無參差前後之弊，淋菌絕無脫逃的機會，較之從前將二藥分別注射者，功效反而確實得多。</p>
<p>通常的內服劑往往有喪失在效力或損害胃腸的弊病，可是在『安敵淋』，發明者傑特生博士已替我們把這層困難完全解決好了。</p>
<p>戒煙常識</p>
<h3>我怎樣從煙毒的束缚中掙扎出來的</h3>
<p>— 尤觀海</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我很不幸地被鴉片束缚了八年之久，最近幸遇良藥，放得安然戒絕，其中經過，擬戒成的同胞們，大概可以借鏡，所以略敘顛末，借　貴刊一角地發表，并藉以稍致謝枕。</p>
<p>我家中本有人吸煙，時於煙榻旁邊談天，他們便常裝好了煙，要我試吸，吸後每感精神振作，遂樂之不疲。這樣過了七八個月，煙癮便套上了我，後來想起，真是作孽自缚。那時我止有三十歲，正是年富有力壯之時，身材長大，肌肉壯碩。吸了一年的煙，我的摸樣開始變了，一身的肌肉落盡，皮膚自紅潤而轉為枯黃；自眶深陷，往日銳利的眼神不知到那裏去了；面容瘦削，彎背曲腰。偶爾攬鏡自照，自己也不解如何會弄得如此萎瑣。</p>
<p>自己痛感僅是如此萎靡不振，生不如死，所以於上癮三年後，會下決心不吸，後來因為痛得滿地亂滾，實在受不了，只得和鴉片重拾墜歡。又故了一年，從親戚抄得一紙戒煙秘方，如法炮製，總想不會失敗了，那知又抄了番老文章。今年夏天，始聞朋友中有服『生殖素』而戒絕的，乃急向中英大藥房購得，連服六星期後，竟完全無痛戒絕，并且精神轉佳，肌肉亦生，煙鬼的狀態已完全消滅，看來就可以恢復八年前的舊狀，『生殖素』的功績，實可稱讚，倘能普及採用，當不難掃盡全國的煙毒。（下略）</p>
<p>性的開明</p>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<h3>從手淫之害說到兒童的環境</h3>
<p>……玩弄天真無邪的兒童局部實為養成未來手淫的導線　……故作猥瑣的言語和舉動每能使兒童發生性的神秘性</p>
<p>手淫雖說是青年的通病，但也不能說個個青年都有手淫的惡習，那未怎樣機能使子弟們不染上這種惡癖呢？最要緊的一句話：就是注意家庭教育，養成兒童們純潔的心靈。要達到以上的目的，並不是難事，祗要使兒童的環境不使混濁，徹底地一句話，不可將不良的印象使兒童接觸，免得因此被誘起手淫的動機。</p>
<p>一般乳母，婢女，男僕，書童，保姆等雇傭，對於主家的兒童，常會使之獲得那不良的性的經驗，這是不可不特別注意的。例如：玩弄那天真無邪的兒童的局部，或故作猥褻的言語和舉動，而使之發生性的興奮，都不是稀奇的事。</p>
<p>又，保姆常為欲靜止小孩的哭泣，而胳肢摸索局部；這些對於兒童，是都會給與不良的影響。</p>
<p>此外，在繪畫上，彤刻上，對於有性意味的表現為主體的淫畫，更是不能絕對地遠！離開兒童的眼目。特別是那行將進入思春期的兒童，因了接觸這些東西，往往招惹了異常的性的興奮，而陷於自賣惡癖的，眞是數見不鮮了。</p>
<p>深信做父母的如能在兒童幼小時特別加以注意，那未成年後的健康基礎，方能鞏固。原因每有青年耽溺於過度的手淫，使性器的發育受阻，已經頻繁，性能喪失殆盡。除此之外，尚有惡化的神經衰弱癥，幾乎籠罩了每個自賣的青年，這種悲慘的事情，我們做醫生的幾為日常所接觸者。現在站在醫學的立場，向千萬的受害青年進一誠懇的忠告！你們的手淫必須要戒除。遺精能使內分泌枯竭，此時可服『希米脫氏固精片』治之，服後遺精即會停止。如因受害較深，致性能喪失者，可服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以挽救之。『生殖素』為雄壯動物的生殖腺素提煉而成，服後能使生殖腺轉弱為强，內分泌之補充，不虞有竭，早洩，陰萎頃刻消滅，性器的發育受內分泌沖旺的滋潤，保證逐漸轉性，種種的神經衰弱癥，如耳鳴頭痛，失眠，健忘等，均能短期治愈。</p>

<p>— 詹念曾醫師主編</p>
<p>（診所）四路川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　門診上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（一）發育不全包皮過長</p>
<p>患者屠敏修，年廿四歲，南京下關人，業古玩生意，旅居上海已六年矣，居住於本阜阿拉白司脫路永康里。（主訴）——十六歲發育尚未成熟，即有手淫惡癖，雖非日日犯之，然已嗜此難拔旋即爆發已經症，致內分泌日漸枯竭，發育受阻，不僅陰莖短小，且包皮過長，近且有神經衰弱症，耳鳴，頭痛，心悸，盜汗，健忘，失眠等症俱全。今夏，出彼友介紹來治。（診時病狀）——陰莖長度在靜止時，不滿而英寸，在澎脹時祗及常人之半，且睾丸萎縮，陰毛稀疏，復有第三度包莖，祗尿道前端留一細孔，排尿時必先注於包皮內，此外肌肉削瘦，面色蒼白，神經衰弱亦烈。遺精每星期至少三次。（治療之法）——每日施行平面電療一次，嚴厲指導其攝生，施手術割去包皮，服『希米脫氏固精片』治其遺精，關於發育不全及一切神經衰弱症，則以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』治之，每日服三次，每次服二片。如是經過兩月，遺精即止，性器官之發育轉佳，較原來增大四分之一。同時神經衰弱症盡除，面色紅潤，肌肉亦逐漸結實矣。</p>
<p>（二）早洩陰萎短期治愈</p>
<p>患者黃國忠，年三十五歲，浙江蕭山人。（主訴）——早年手淫過度，中年從慾無度，致患早洩，陰萎等症，且精神與身體虧態不堪，故遺精頻繁，肌肉削瘦，面無人容。上月初自來求治。（診時病狀）——精關弛鬆。遺精每月達二十餘次之多，性機能完全喪失。一切營養不佳，精神不振，面色蒼白，稍一工作，即感氣喘乏力。（治療之法）——珍得黃君因手淫及從慾之故，生殖腺大受摧殘，而精關受害而鬆懈。除每日施行電療之外，服以『希米脫氏固精片』止其遺精，三星期後，遺精即止。以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』强壯其生殖腺，早洩，陰萎徹底治愈，不僅性能健全，且能充分發揮其持久性矣</p>

<h3>現代婦女的乳峯美</h3>
<p>— 香港醫大醫科學士吳大超</p>
<p>對於乳峯美的重視，並不從今日開始，過去的中國詞中，我們已經聽見了許多讚美乳峯的佳作。不過在舊禮教的束缚下，沒有人敢公然出來提倡，非但如此，而且將乳房緊束起來，阻礙其自然的發育，所以舊式女子，常有乳房萎痛，身軀柔弱者。這種柔弱的女子，所生子女，常先不足，發育不良，於是許多現代的少女，很不幸地生著萎痛的乳房。</p>
<p>同時，現代人特別注意全身的曲線美，這一對高高聳起的乳房，飽滿結實，彈性豐富，使曲線畢露，對於異性有充分的勾引力。更進一步言，高聳的乳峯即為發育良好的徵象，所以又為健康的基礎。婦女們若因先天不足，或以後天于手淫等原因而失去了乳峯美，實在是最大的損失，斷非任何化妝術所可補救。且身體軟弱，連帶常患白帶，經期絮亂等症，決不可輕易忽視。</p>
<p>幸而奧國的生理學大家斯丹那博士發明了一種女性生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』，能促進生殖腺的發育，使生命的泉源旺盛，當然可以化弱為强，萎痛的乳房也能發育飽滿，隆然高聳，成為一個健美的女子。所有月經不調，瘦弱無力等症自然也一掃而空。不過如兼患白帶，尚須自行用『療帶霉』為坐藥以清除之。</p>

<h3>骨痛遷延不治的惡果</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>患骨痛者，並非是不治之症，但人們每因誤於治療，釀成種種之變症，甚或成為終身不愈的幸福桎梏。這是什麽緣故呢？多數因為患者忽略了本症的變症，大凡一個體弱的人，百分之八十以上，都有骨痛症的初步症候。這種骨痛症的初步症候，就是腰背酸痛症。如若誤於治療，施即覺骨節酸痛，有時筋絡辛痛，倘再不求有效的治療，則疼痛蔓延及於全身，由疼痛而麻木，結果爆發半身不遂症。倘能每個腰背酸痛者從早預防，深信骨痛的惡果不能促成。預防之法，應使精力强壯，抵抗力健全，則腰背酸痛永不發作。故體弱者，必須以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』使內分泌充實，精力鞏固，使骨痛症失卻醞釀的機會。同時對於已發之骨痛患者，可服以『强斯登氏骨痛片』確具祛風，除濕，清血及預防動脈硬化的功能，故其效果，能駕一切骨痛藥之上，博得國內外醫學界的推崇。</p>
<h3>胃痛七年</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝人素有胃痛之疾，此病於民國十九年起始，迄今已歷七年，現在病甚沉重，且胃口不佳，自知瘤疾難治，幸得同病新愈之王轉霣君介紹『胃痛靈』一治疼痛，服『健胃素』以助消化。不料服後疼痛立止，胃口亦佳（范鎔）</p>
<h3>乳房豐腴</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝人體雖無病，但乳房一場萎縮，致同學咸以『為小姐』嘲我。余乃服之，經過兩月，精神充足異常，而臀部與乳峯，已豐腴而高聳矣。（范世美）</p>
<h3>白帶得愈</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝人素有帶下之疾，有時可不治自愈，有時則洶湧異常，雖會服藥治療，未能痊愈，旋見新聞報載『療帶靈』可治白帶，乃向永安公司購得一盒，外用之後，立刻潔淨，至今未發，深信受白帶之苦必多，故特介紹（承瑞）</p>
<h3>病後失調</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>余之父母體均潺弱，故余亦藥石不斷，自今夏大病之後，愈形狼狽，病雖治而體力終不能復原。旋有同居徐君囑以『生殖素』補之，經過兩月，果然體力恢復，精神大振，面色紅潤，肌肉已飽滿矣。因效果確實，故特為之誠意介紹，以作滋補。病後感精力不足者注意之（孫立人）</p>

<h3>只准轟炸不許射擊</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>這次匪偽軍大舉侵綏，背景何在，早爲世人有目所共觀。某國不但供給大批軍火，且派軍官從中指揮，並用飛機參加助戰。前日我軍攻取百靈廟時，他們有飛機四架，向我軍陣地轟擲炸彈，被我方擊落三架。某國這種舉動，實有背國際公法，現反提出抗議說，該項飛機，雙翅有日本國徽，華軍向該項飛機射擊，賞無異向日本國徽侮辱云云，更覺令人笑倒！</p>
<p>我國一向被某國飛機威脅，受害已屬不淺。東北被他們用飛機炸去一塊土地，上海閘北也被他們用飛機炸成一片荒土。平津一帶，近來天空上又時有某國飛機出現，使得市面惶惶不安。這回匪偽軍贸然蠢動，對方更爲活躍，派飛機參加助戰，屢次向我軍肆力轟擲炸彈。百靈廟一役，我軍將他們作戰飛機，轟落三架，眞太快人心！現反說射擊有日本國徽飛機是侮辱，那宋轟炸中國土地是什麼？表示親善嗎？只准自己擲彈炸人，不許別人開槍還擊，天下豈有是理！</p>
<p>現在中央已出軍援助，前日中央空軍，並派飛機七架，向陣地偵查敵踪。但僅僅偵察，還是不够。他们敢用飛機炸進來，我們也應用飛機炸出去！航空救國，國人渴望甚殷。至今全國置備飛機，巳屬不少，這時不出動，更待何時？</p>
<h3>葬</h3>
<p>— 劉公島</p>
<p>接連着三天，在寒風中顫着「桂兒回來！」呌喜魂的聲音，是誰家的兒子生着病呢？</p>
<p>時間總在夜餐過後，妻帶了孩子到後房去睡了，我在燈下翻幾頁書，或是預備一點朋天要做的工作。冬天的晚上，這大雜院中是像死一般的寂寞，呌賣糖葫蘆的聲音是那樣寥遠，彷彿在夢裏一樣。邢「桂兒，回來！」的蚪喜魂顯得就在我的紙窗外面；這使我停止了要做的工作，側着耳朶傾聽那聲音的由來。那是南方家鄉的口音，那個用低微而　啞的聲音在回答着「回來啦！」</p>
<p>我想從窗隙中向外望去，窗外是漆黑的一片，彷彿遠遠的地方有一盞昏暗的燈籠在移動着，是兩個可憐的異鄉人在尋覓他們兒子的喜魂呢！</p>
<p>第二天早上，我問妻子是那一家的桂兒害了病？她回答我是住在最後近牛棚那邊木匠寶根的兒子。我彷彿也見過那個可憐的中年人，他有着一張蒼老的面孔，身上總是穿着一套不相稱的寬大的衣服。但是走路是那樣敏捷，走過我窗外的時候，祇一閃就不見他的影子了。</p>
<p>同是淪落在異鄉的客，我回憶着我的孩子生病時妻子焦慮的面孔，我就祈求着那個可憐的小生命早日平安！</p>
<p>但是接連着三天，呌喜魂的聲音　在我刚想動手做一點事的時候，不先不後從寒風中送過來。一種同情的激越，使我焦急地在房內蹀　着。那個可憐的孩子不知病到如何地步了？</p>
<p>昨天晚上，在我心中預期着那呌喜魂的聲音將要出現的時候，我躺在椅子裏抽着烟捲，我那能再有心緒去預備明</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>天要做的工作呢！那顫抖的「桂兒，回來！」二彷彿是無數的尖針一樣刺着我的心房，同時一張陷落的靑色的面孔浮現在我的面前，或許他已經不能受藥了，那苦的藥汁灌進他的翕張若的嘴裏的時侯，他一點也不倔强，再也不喊「苦！苦！」用細小的手推着媽媽授過去的藥匙。藥汁祗在他的喉頭打一個滾，就完全吐了出來，那暗黃的流汁從嘴角邊掛到頸　裏去，枕衣印着一大堆水漬。這時候，你忍心去看一看做母親的緊結着眉心的面孔嗎？</p>
<p>於是她莫奈何地站起來，對呆立在床畔的丈失瞥了一眼，顫抖地燃了一盞紙　　，幾乎用脚尖走着路，輕輕地踅出臥房。房外的風刀割一樣的劃着他們的面孔？打了個寒噤，把破舊的圍巾，或者竟是布條之類，緊裏了頭部，一路細心地搜覓着喜魂，喊着「桂兒，回來！」</p>
<p>完全是我目覩着一樣，我的心是緊跟在他們的背後，低低地回答他們：「回來啦！」我這樣迷糊着直坐過半夜，兩條腿幾乎都麻木了，却沒有聽到「桂兒，回來！」的呌聲，我暗陪欣喜那個可憐的小生命得救了，他的母親不知怎樣驚喜着擁在胸懷裏低聲哼着安睡歌呢？</p>
<p>然而我怎樣來述叙今天早上遇見的事呢？我可以告訴你們那個可憐的孩子在昨天晚上　死了嗎？</p>
<p>那個木匠親自抬着一具硃砂水的小棺材從我的窗外走過，他的脚步仍是那樣敏捷。妻子跟在後面，已經哭不出聲音來了，長長的鼻涕掛在她的嘴唇上。她頭望着靑天一躓一仆地跟着去下葬了。</p>
<p>我呆立着，我想到南方的家，我的母親已經二次寫信來要我回家去，她說要看一看我的兒子呢！</p>
<p>窗外飄着雪，風史大了，我閉上了紙窗。</p>
<h3>連白茶也沒得喝的時候</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>昨天，一早我就跑出去了，我希望遇到一個熟人，頂好是最意外的相遇，假如，他有一點錢……</p>
<p>一直到晚上，我是在失望里。</p>
<p>沿著風凉的霞飛路往西走，一直走到善鐘路，我往一個偏僻一點的地方一拐，風有力地跟沙子織成一個網，凶猛地向我撲過來，好像我就是一尾魚。但是，我衝出來了，網爛了一個大窟窿，向前倒過去……嗯，我勝利了。</p>
<p>也許老李在家吧？會在家的，今天，我是勝利的，誰能戰勝過我呢？沒有誰”以戰勝我的……</p>
<p>我放開步了，踏著枯萎了的秋草，很得意。到弄堂口上，別人都看我中，也沒理，一直往老李住處底後門跑，然　，亭子間里的窗子是黑暗的。我不知道怎麽好，也許是他病了吧，他常常生病的，不，昨天還好好的哩，大概是看戲去了，不，他沒錢，那麽，他沒有出去嗎？</p>
<p>我望着窗子，窗子開着，但是沒有光，黑　　的，窗帘在兩旁搖攏着，像才學會舞蹈的小姑娘。嗯，大概……</p>
<p>「老李」！用手兜着嘴：「老李！老李」</p>
<p>沒有回聲，倒是別個窗裏的人，伸出頭來望了望，又把窗關閉了，弄堂里寂靜得很，好像什麽東西都呌老李帶走了。</p>
<p>失望地出來，到老茅那兒未吧。</p>
<p>老茅也沒在家，但是，我知道他底鑰匙放在那見，我進到屋里，看看寫字檯上，空虛地放着發本捲邊的書，一個銅板也沒有；拉開抽屜，也是空洞洞的，媽媽的！爲什麼一個銅板也帶在身上呢？</p>
<p>失望而又興奮地坐在吱吱地像老鼠呌的椅子上，呆看着天花板。</p>
<p>然後，又把所有的地方巡查了一遍，我需要的，什麽也沒有。</p>
<p>那麽，明天連倒半個銅板的開水也不可能了……</p>
<p>回到家，我抽出自己往家寫的信：「……底生活很快樂……」這就是快樂的生活，一個劇本里曾經描寫一羣大學生只能喝白茶，我呢，明天，……明天就什麽也完蛋了！</p>
<p>我望着空杯子，空水瓶，還有空空的桌面，跟抽屜。</p>
<p>可是，當我想起那個「明天」，跟我現在每天作的事情，心里充滿了無限的溫暖。我亂想，想到緊張的地方，胸膊也緊張起來了，突突地跳！……口乾了，一種要求逼迫着我……</p>
<p>明天呵……</p>

<p>風調雨順慶昇平。唐明皇是，寡人好色愛傾城。後宮粉黛無顏色。惟有，梅妃才貌獨超羣。眉如柳。髮如雲。花容月貌麗天生。風流天子承恩澤。月下花前共晨昏。眞所謂，情意纏綿似海深。誰知道，掩袖工讒楊氏女。娥眉新選入宮門。爭寵奪愛心妬嫉。狐媚徧能惑至尊。從此隔院笙鼓喧天鬧。我這裏凄凉寂寞滿院庭。秋水欲穿馬不臨。戀新歡。忘舊人。男子從來是薄情。秋風未起團扇捐。哭壞了，世上多少美人心。梅妃是，獨自想思迴腸斷。祇有蠟炬有心墮淚到天明。不多時，胡兒叛逆登金殿。原爲那百媚千嬌楊太眞。暴風在雨催得緊。紅粉佳人斷了魂。端留那，香骨凄凉葬梅林。</p>

<p>荊蕪荒僻小鄕村。漁樵耕讀滿邑城。隱士多出深山內。蓬門柴扉過光陰。最多散淡淸閒客。對月吟詩暗傷神。有那少年英俊樵柴漢。却原來負薪入山賢會參。他是聖人門下受孔敎。事母至孝倍當心。村中盡知曾孝子。滿城傳遍好名聲。那一日曾參携斧山中去。伐木購米孝娘親。不料家中有客到。會母無措待來賓。阮囊羞澀無良策。旣無酒食與金銀。望兒速歸總不見。心中焦急待怎生。素知骨血母子脈。一氣貫通兩相應。囓破手指狠心咬。會參心中痛不禁。負薪忽忽歸家去。跪請老娘是何因。會母卽便開言說。方才有客到寒門。因你未歸周旋少。故而是，囓指傳意命兒歸。好一個聖腎孝義曾參子。人寰稀少至情深。屬毛離裏知悟君。</p>

<h3>After Chen Cheng Arrived in GuiSui, It Was Said That ZuoYi Convenes a Meeting; JiaBu Temple's Li ShouXin's Troops Revolt; Bandit-Puppets Plan to Invade in Two Routes; Puppet Troops Continuously Open DuoLun ShangDu; Some Troops Move Towards ZhangBei</h3>
<p>(GuiHua) Chen Cheng arrived in Sui on the night of the 28th. The headquarters was set up in GuiSui Public Hospital. On the morning of the 29th, he met with senior Mongolian and Han generals such as DaLing MiSuLong. At noon, Fu ZuoYi hosted a banquet for Chen in the provincial government, as well as Tang EnBo, Wang JingGuo, Zhao ChengShou, Men BingYue and many others. They also held a meeting. At 3 pm, Chen hosted news reporters. In the evening, he attended a public banquet held by various circles in Sui. Chen will stay in Sui for a few more days. It is said that he plans to go to BaiLingMiao. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(ZhangJiaKou) At 10 pm on the 28th, a part of Li ShouXin's troops revolted in JiaBu Temple. At that time, the order was chaotic, and the bandit-puppet's nest was also destroyed by the revolting army. It is rumored that Li himself also repented and revolted. Gan Ying's troops, Su YuTian, have indeed revolted. The morale of the bandit-puppet army is increasingly scattered. A certain party is very worried and decided to replenish their strength in the short term, with the Rehe army as the main force, invading westward from XingHe, ordering ShangDu to defend temporarily. Currently, there are more than 300 soldiers from ZhangBei to a certain party, and there are also many repair, manufacturing and rescue personnel. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(GuiHua) Zhao ChengShou, Shi JingGuo, and others went to the provincial government at 11 am on the 29th to meet with Fu ZuoYi to discuss defense matters. It is heard that Chen Cheng, Tang EnBo, Men BingYue, Wang WanLin, Wang PiLian, and Zeng YanYi and other generals also participated. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(BeiPing) Certain military officers and Mongolian bandit leaders have convened a meeting in JiaBu Temple for several days to discuss the plan to disturb Sui. It is heard that they plan to invade in two routes: one route to counterattack BaiLingMiao, and the other to use ShangDu as a base to invade XingHe TaoLin. The attack will be launched as soon as the reinforcements from the Rehe area arrive. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(ZhangJiaKou) On the 28th, a plane from Li ShouXin's puppet army crashed in the sky over ShangDu, causing the ammunition depot to burn, resulting in extremely heavy losses. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(GuiHua) Chen Cheng hosted the Sui news media at 3 pm on the 29th. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(BeiPing) People from ZhangBei said that after Wang Ying's bandits and the Mongolian army were defeated and fled east from BaiLingMiao, they suffered heavy casualties, and the morale of Wang's bandits was scattered, with many escaping and resuming the life of roving bandits. Recently, according to the results of the meeting of the bandits in JiaBu Temple, Wang Ying's troops have been transferred to the DaQingGou area for replenishment. In addition, more than 3,000 puppet troops from Zhang HaiPeng and Wang JingXiu's Rehe 5th Military Region have been sent to the area south of PangJiang, on the border between WuXi and LiangMeng, in an attempt to counterattack BaiLingMiao. The puppet troops from west Rehe have been continuously arriving in ShangDu, ZhangBei, and other places. Military equipment and supplies are being transported from Rehe via WeiChang and DuoLun to ChaBei day and night. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(TianJin) JiNing Telegram: ShangDu City has solid trenches built on the northwest, south, and three sides, with more than 4,000 puppet troops defending day and night, fearing our army's attack. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(BeiPing) ZhangYuan Telegram: DeWang is now indeed in PangJiang. His Second Army only has Bao YueQing and Yi HengE's two divisions, less than 5,000 people, concentrated in the area from PangJiang to ZhangBei. DeWang's attitude is hesitant, with no determination to counterattack. There are many advisors sent by a certain party to monitor him on the left and right. Of the 5,000 puppet troops who departed from FengNing DaGe in Rehe for DuoLun, most have already arrived in DuoLun. Special forces, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery teams, etc. from a certain party, originally stationed in the area from DuoLun to PangJiang, have all moved towards ZhangBei. In the areas of GuYuan, ChiCheng, and LongGuan, the number of troops from a certain party has been increasing day by day, with many entering. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(GuiHua) It is certain that there are no traces of bandits within hundreds of miles from SuiChuan and WuChuan to the north of BaiLingMiao. The troops stationed in BaiLingMiao are now ordered by Fu ZuoYi to summon lamas and merchants to return to BaiLingMiao to live and work in peace. The military hospital and BaiLingMiao Hotel set up on the south street of BaiLingMiao will also be reorganized and reopened by our side. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(BeiPing) Sources say that around ShangDu in ChaBei, a part of the bandit army led by Zhang HaiPeng and others, numbering about 7,000, has recently arrived from the Rehe area, planning to be stationed in the DaQingShan area. DeTuKe is still recuperating in JiaBu Temple. The previous report that he had returned to PangJiang was inaccurate. According to people who have recently come from Sui, the defenses of the National Army in the SuiDong area are extremely solid. At present, the ground is frozen, and it is freezing and snowing. It is difficult for the bandit army to launch a large-scale invasion recently. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(GuiHua) The reporters' frontline inspection group from PingJinHu arrived in BaiLingMiao from Sui on the 27th, and returned to WuChuan on the afternoon of the 28th, and will arrive in Sui at night. Bandit planes flew to the temple on the 28th to reconnaissance and drop bombs, but there was no damage. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(GuiHua) Duan MaoLan has not completed the collection of materials, so the original plan to leave Sui on the 28th did not materialize. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(GuiHua) Chen Cheng arrived in DaTong from Bing at 11 am on the 28th, and left DaTong at 2 pm for Sui, arriving that night. Men BingYue came along. Da MiLing SuLong also came to Sui on the afternoon of the 28th, planning to pay respects to Fu and Chen for instructions. Fu expressed great satisfaction with Da's loyalty and bravery. Zeng YanYi, who recovered BaiLingMiao, completed the post-war defense arrangements for the temple and has now returned to report to Fu, and it is said that Fu praised Zeng quite a bit. Sun LanFeng and Sun ChangSheng are currently stationed at the front, and the area is extremely peaceful. ChaBei is 500 miles away from the temple. It is said that the bandits are trying to attack, but in fact it is absolutely impossible to succeed. In recent days, only scattered bandits have been harassing the border of XingHe in SuiDong, not daring to enter the interior. However, bandits in ShangDu are rushing to build fortifications, with a posture of resisting stubbornly relying on the terrain. (28th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Mongolian Bandits Retreat</p>
<p>Looting Along the Way</p>
<p>(BeiPing) When the Mongolian bandits were defeated by our army in BaiLingMiao and retreated to PangJiang, they looted along the way. The yurts of ordinary Mongolian people were mostly looted. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhao PiLian Talks About</p>
<p>The Recent Situation in Sui</p>
<p>(NanJing) Zhao PiLian said that looking at the overall situation in Sui, it is not only the beginning of a war, but also has the trend of continuing to expand. The current calm is a phenomenon that should exist before a major war. The claim that Su YuSan, a brigade commander under Wang Ying, revolted and surrendered has not yet been received by telegram from TaiYuan, but it has been proven to be true from other aspects. The central government only feels sorrow for the generals who have been deceived and used by the bandits, and does not harbor hatred. We are all Chinese, and if we made mistakes in the past, but now repent, we are still patriotic citizens. The proclamations and surrender rewards issued by Chairman Jiang and Director Yan are to open up a broad path of self-renewal, so that our Chinese compatriots who have been deceived can repent and return to the path of righteousness, loyalty, and bravery. The princes of Sui and Mongolia are extremely angry at DeWang for starting a war for no reason and have requested the central government to punish him. However, the central government is based on the principle of generosity and hopes that he can repent automatically and return to his original intention of being loyal to the party and the country. Prince Yun has always been extremely supportive and obedient to the central government. After thanking him for his position in the Chahar-Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, he took up his position as a member of the National Government. This time, when the National Army recovered BaiLingMiao, Prince Yun not only sent personnel to comfort the army, but also slaughtered sheep and donated clothing to comfort the soldiers. The Mongolian Committee had previously telegraphed to request him to go to the temple to preside over everything. His residence is very close to BaiLingMiao, and he can arrive within an hour by car. He will probably go soon. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Prince A Cables</p>
<p>That He Has Returned to SuiYuan</p>
<p>(NanJing) Prince A, the deputy director of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council, telegraphed to Beijing, reporting that he has returned to Suiyuan and is discussing border defense with Chairman Fu. The leagues and banners in Suiyuan are peaceful except for the construction of defense works against bandits. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bandit Planes Fly Over the Temple</p>
<p>Dropping Many Bombs</p>
<p>(GuiHua) News from SuiDong and SuiBei is calm, but bandit planes are constantly flying over the National Army's positions for reconnaissance and bombing. On the 28th, a bandit plane flew back and forth over BaiLingMiao three times, dropping more than 20 bombs. The National Army suffered no losses. The reporter's inspection group arrived at the temple on the 27th and 28th respectively. (28th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>The Combat Capability of the Kwantung Army</p>
<p>(TianJin) JiNing Telegram: The Japanese Kwantung Army is currently stationed in both North and South Manchuria, consisting of the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 74th Divisions, the Railway Guard Corps, two mixed brigades, and 90,000 special forces, and three air regiments, including fighter and bomber units, totaling 400 aircraft. If it directly acts against Suiyuan, it can deploy a maximum of two divisions and more than 100 aircraft. The rest must stay behind to monitor the rebellion of the puppet Manchukuo army and defend against Russia. Therefore, those who advocate war this time are mostly from the Kwantung Army, but the central leadership does not quite agree. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(GuiHua) The reporter went to BaiLingMiao in the morning of the 27th for inspection. Due to the snow accumulation of more than a foot between WuChuan and the temple, it was difficult for the car to travel, so it arrived at 10 pm. The garrison commander, Regiment Commander Liu WenXin, led the reporter to rest at the former site of a certain special agency office north of the temple. The reporter learned the details of the National Army's capture of BaiLingMiao as follows: First, the National Army began to attack BaiLingMiao at about 10 pm on the 23rd. The puppet bandit army resisted fiercely. In addition, certain commanders and advisors personally came out to supervise the battle. The National Army first attacked from the southern pass with infantry, launching seven consecutive assaults, fighting fiercely until 5 am. Our company commanders Zhang ZhenJi and Yang TianZhu led their teams to bravely charge with armored vehicles. The bandit forces were unable to resist and retreated. At that time, another unit of the National Army also defeated the enemy forces on the west side, and Sun ChangSheng's cavalry team also broke through the rear of the bandit army north of the mountain. Certain commanders and advisors saw that the situation was gone, so they ordered the Mongolian puppet army and the lamas in the temple to resist stubbornly in the temple. They set fire to the airfield and fled from the pass in the northeast. By 9 am on the 24th, the National Army had completely recaptured BaiLingMiao. The bandit army's flour, ammunition, guns, and gasoline, which had been purchased and transported for two or three years, were all seized by the National Army. The number of Mongolian puppet soldiers who died was countless. The National Army also had more than a hundred deaths. Liu JingXin's regiment and Yang TianZhu's company suffered more casualties due to their brave assault. According to Regiment Commander Liu, the bandit puppet army's conspiracy to invade our Sui territory was timely suppressed by the National Army. If the attack had been delayed for a day or two, the bandit's labor would have been more intensified, or it may have been more difficult. In addition, it was learned that the National Army captured two or three hundred bandit soldiers, all of whom were treated favorably, given money, and released. Among them, several were willing to serve in the National Army and have been taken in by Liu Tuan. The reporter inquired about their experience in joining the puppet army and fighting. On the morning of the 28th, the reporter went to BaiLingMiao and the mountains in the southeast to inspect in detail. The architecture of Lingyu is extremely magnificent, but the bandit troops swept away the sundries when they were about to collapse, which was extremely desolate. The fortifications on the mountains are also considered solid, but the National Army's brave suppression won the victory. Bandit corpses and dead horses were everywhere in the mountain ditches. Since the National Army recovered BaiLingMiao, a certain party has been constantly sending planes to drop bombs. There are still two unexploded bombs as big as turnips on the open space in front of the temple, and four boxes of mortars with certain marks are scattered on the open space unused. Fortunately, the houses in the temple have not been bombed. There are no traces of bandits within hundreds of miles of BaiLingMiao. After the reporter finished inspecting all the places, Regiment Commander Liu gathered all the soldiers again, and the comfort group who went with them gave a speech. Finally, the soldiers' representative gave a thank-you speech, saying that if we do not desperately defend the soldiers and kill the thieves, we swear not to be human, etc. Their generous and heroic spirit is admirable. In total, Liu JingXin's regiment, Zhang ZhenJi's and Yang TianZhu's two companies, and Sun ChangSheng's cavalry and Sun LanFeng's infantry brigade contributed the most to this battle. The reporter left the temple at 8 am and returned to Sui at 8 pm. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

The authorities have taken strict precautions. Recruitment personnel of unknown origin have been discovered in ZaoQiang and NanGong counties in JiZhong, and certain foreigners are in charge. The security agencies have paid attention. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Luoyang Military Academy Anniversary Week Chairman Jiang Attends and Addresses Recapturing BaiLingMiao is the Starting Point for National Rejuvenation The Conclusion of the German-Japanese Agreement Has No Impact on East Asia</h3>
<p>(LuoYang) Chairman Jiang attended the memorial week of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen at the Luoyang Military Branch School at 9 am on the 29th. He briefly stated that there were two important events last week: one was domestic, the recapture of BaiLingMiao, and the other was international, the conclusion of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. The former boosted the morale of the people across the country and made the soldiers and civilians know that as long as the country is united, the people are unanimous, and determined to fight to the end, there is no reason to lose an inch of land. Therefore, the recovery of BaiLingMiao is the starting point for the rejuvenation of our nation and the greatest key to the security of our country. As for the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, I firmly believe that its main purpose is only to jointly prevent communism, and I don't think there will be any deeper secret agreements, as widely rumored, because Germany cannot completely disregard its friendship with China and other countries. In my view, the German agreement not only does not change the external situation of Germany and Japan, but also has no impact on the overall situation in East Asia. Regarding the anti-communist point, because there are still remnants of Red bandits in China disturbing the borders, it seems that there is a relationship, but our revolution aims to seek national freedom and independence, so we must firmly maintain the inherent position of independence and autonomy on any issue. The remaining Red bandits in China are actually traitors in disguise, and we will of course thoroughly eliminate them to achieve a consistent claim, but this is entirely China's internal affairs and will not be affected or constrained by any international influence.

<h3>The Xiongjia Bridge Dam of the Xianghe Embankment in Zhongxiang is Joined; Embankment Closure Project to Begin Within Days</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondent: The Xianghe Embankment in Zhongxiang, which is related to the lives and property of eleven counties and cities in Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and Tianmen, was previously repaired under the direction of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. Tens of thousands of workers were mobilized, and millions of dollars were spent over several months, completing over 95% of the construction. Unfortunately, on May 26th, the Xiang River suddenly rose, and the fourth section of the embankment suddenly collapsed, ruining the efforts. With the embankment collapsed, the National Economic Council believed that with a major flood imminent, the work could not be interrupted and decided to do everything possible to salvage the situation. It consulted with the Hubei Provincial Government and agreed to form a Post-Disaster Engineering Committee, which was established on June 11th. Fan Xiji was hired as the chairman, and Chen Ruzhen, Xi Dejiong, Shi Yuling, and Feng Limin were hired as committee members, responsible for rushing to close the breach. On June 27th, the work of securing the breach with rows of woven bamboo began, scheduled to be closed by July 1st. Unexpectedly, the Xiang River rose greatly that night, coupled with storms and rain, making it impossible to work. Before it could be closed, it collapsed again. Even during the major flood, Fan and others continued to work. By the 20th of this month, the Xiongjia Bridge dam, which protects the embankment, had completed the work of cutting off the flow and joining the gap, which can be said to have come to an end. The embankment closure project will begin within days. The details of the construction process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strengthening Embankments and Preventing Floods</p>
<p>The Post-Disaster Engineering Committee was ordered to continue construction and immediately decided on a plan to first cut off the flow at the breach at Xiongjia Bridge and then repair the embankment of the fourth section of the Luohan Temple. Therefore, it first sought to protect the remaining engineering work of the Xiongjia Bridge dam, and at the same time, completed and transported all the materials needed to close the breach to the site. At the same time, it consulted with the magistrates of the four counties of Zhongxiang, Jingshan, Qianjiang, and Tianmen to determine the methods for recruiting workers for the closure of the breach and the construction of the embankment, as well as the construction of the worker roads and the construction of worker sheds. After thorough preparation, it then engaged in (1) Strengthening the fourth section of the embankment: The fourth section of the embankment, originally repaired by the Xiang River Engineering Office, was not high enough and was very thin. It was continuously strengthened, and mountain soil was transported by trolley and boat to reinforce the sides. The original 150,000 cubic meters of open earthwork in this section was reduced to 100,000 cubic meters after strengthening. (2) Constructing permeable dams: A permeable dam was constructed outside the third, sixth, and seventh breaches of the Sanggongtou Yujiashan Downstream and the barrier dam and inside the eighth breach to allow for natural siltation, thereby saving labor. As a result, the silt rose by one meter. Two permeable dams were constructed outside the embankment of the fourth section of Luohan Temple, and three were constructed inside the embankment to increase the amount of earth for repairing the embankment. As a result, silt rose by one meter in ten areas, and the front and rear of the embankment toe were also silted up. This not only reduced the amount of earth needed to build the embankment but also provided surplus clay for reinforcing the sides. (3) Flood prevention: From July 5th to October 20th, the Xiang River rose eleven times, with the rise on September 17th being the highest, with a rise of over three meters in one day. The water level inside and outside the breach differed by two meters. The current flowed in turbulently, with the force of a waterfall. The waves soared into the sky, and the two dams could hardly be seen. Traffic was completely cut off. The head of the dam gradually sank, and it was stabilized only after a night of rescue. The length of the breach was originally 550 meters. After the emergency closure in June, it was reduced to 116 meters. Therefore, the successive rises in water caused the current to be constricted by the breach, controlling the scouring and allowing downstream counties to gradually divert the water, preventing a major disaster.</p>
<p>The Process of Closing the Breaches at Xiongjia Bridge</p>
<p>The Committee decided to first cut off the flow at the breach at Xiongjia Bridge and began work on October 21st. There were eight breaches in the original dam at this location. The first breach had a space of 1,571.46 cubic meters, which was reconstructed into a crescent dam. The second breach had a space of 1,298.39 cubic meters. The third breach had a space of 2,690.60 cubic meters. The fourth and fifth breaches had a space of 1,284.98 cubic meters, which were jointly constructed into a crescent dam. The sixth breach had a space of 1,580.81 cubic meters. The seventh breach had a space of 2,134.75 cubic meters. The eighth breach had a space of 9,000.00 cubic meters. Work on the first through seventh breaches began successively from October 21st and was completed by November 18th. The eighth breach was 250 meters long and was a large-scale project. Work began on November 8th. The south dam was advanced step by step using pile rows and mud weirs. The north dam was advanced by pushing and sweeping. After the breach was reduced to 100 meters, finer woven bamboo was used for advancement. Both dams progressed smoothly. Starting on the 16th, braided bamboo was used. At 2:00 PM on the 20th, the work of driving the tie-rope piles began. At 4:00 PM, the "dragon coat" (protective layer) was laid, followed by the filling of materials. At 5:30 PM, the closure was safely completed. By noon on the 22nd, the air seal was completed. The workers for closing the breaches, from the first to the sixth, were recruited locally. The workers for the seventh and eighth breaches were supplied by the three counties of Zhongxiang, Jingshan, and Qianjiang, totaling 4,000 people, with soil boats participating in the transportation of earth. It should be noted that the cutoff project at this location was only to facilitate the repair of the dike at Luohan Temple. Therefore, the closing height of each breach was only 43.5 meters, with the intention of ensuring its structural integrity for 70 days. Until January of the 26th year of the Republic, after the four dikes of the remote dike are completed, the retaining dam can be abandoned.</p>
<h3>Basic Understanding of the Sino-Japanese Problem (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xianwen</p>
<p>— Reading Mr. Yamazaki Yasuzumi's "China Which Rejects Japan"—</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>I cannot understand why the Japanese are trying to sacrifice China to maintain their capitalism instead of seeking other ways out. Mr. Yamazaki might say: "Fundamentally speaking, the world capitalist economic system built over the past two hundred years is collapsing. A new world economic system—naturally, one that has abandoned capitalism—is being reorganized. This is the unfolding of an era of blocs. In the Far East, the result will be the liberation of Far Eastern nations from the shackles of Europe and America. An equitable bloc absolutely needs to be organized during this process. Today's capitalist Japan is prioritizing and crudely carrying out this fundamental requirement, which is why it is being met with antipathy from the Chinese people. But ultimately, Japan's demand stems from world conditions, and it is also necessary for the unity of Far Eastern nations." Mr. Yamazaki is telling us that Japan does not want to sacrifice China to maintain its capitalism, but only hopes that the Chinese and Japanese people will jointly organize a Far Eastern ethnic bloc to escape the "shackles of Europe and America." But in my view, the organization of such a bloc is indeed an inevitable phenomenon of "the world capitalist economic system built over the past hundred years entering a process of collapse." However, the emergence of this inevitable phenomenon is nothing more than an attempt by several advanced capitalist countries to extend the life of their capitalism. Therefore, the British Empire wants to win over India and Australia to organize a bloc, and the American financial empire wants to win over the South American nations to organize a bloc. This is no different from Japan's desire to win over so-called Manchuria and China to organize a "Japan, Manchukuo, and China bloc," or even to expand it to a so-called Far Eastern or Asian bloc. Because of this, the countries being won over do not feel that it is absolutely necessary, as Mr. Yamazaki does. If the actions of Japanese imperialism since the September 18th Incident are precisely due to the demand to organize a Far Eastern bloc, then China not only does not feel the need for such a bloc, but will also be frightened by it.</p>
<p>"Facts speak louder than words." We certainly do not deny the "embarrassment" that British and American imperialism has brought to China, but what we find most "embarrassing" is that the lost territory of the four northeastern provinces has not been recovered, and the situation in Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and eastern regions is alarming. Things like the smuggling of silver and the leakage of contraband all give the Chinese people an embarrassing impression. Therefore, although we feel extremely unfortunate and regret the occurrence of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, if we investigate why these incidents occurred, we cannot but acknowledge that "there is a reason within, and it is by no means accidental." To be honest, among the wealthy people in China, there is indeed a portion who are "relatively clear-headed." What they worry about is not the problem between China and Japan, but the problem of communism versus non-communism. If there were no threat of being "communized" in China, their determination to resist Japan might be even stronger. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party declared that it could abolish the Soviet areas and advocate that all parties and factions unite to resist Japan. This is precisely to reduce the threat of communism to a portion of Chinese people in order to promote their anti-Japanese courage. This group of people could have been the backbone of Sino-Japanese cooperation, but under Japan's current policies, they are also hesitant to move forward. Mr. Hu Shi once proposed the minimum conditions for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, such as abolishing extraterritorial rights and the Tanggu Truce, but the result was like a stone sinking into the sea. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for Mr. Yamazaki to talk about Sino-Japanese cooperation. Mr. Yamazaki seems to know this too, so he said: "The important point of Sino-Japanese cooperation is for Japan to first grasp the hearts of the Chinese people. If Japan wants to talk about anti-communism, then Japan must give the Chinese people greater interests than anti-communism, otherwise anti-communism will absolutely not succeed. It is particularly dangerous for Japan to learn the ideology and methods of Italy and Germany. Because the ideals of Italy and Germany have no global value, and their opponents are black Africans. The Chinese people are definitely not black people. The Chinese people understand the subtleties of human relationships and possess a beautiful philosophy of life. In this regard, the Chinese are a first-class nation. If Japan does not first establish a theory and method of how to make this nation coexist, co-prosper, and justly cooperate with Japan, then the result will be that Japan is in danger of being defeated by Soviet Russia." Indeed! Indeed! What I now hope from Mr. Yamazaki is to please study how to first establish a theory and method in Japan that can enable China and Japan to justly cooperate and coexist and co-prosper. Other than reforming Japan's imperialist system, I am afraid there is no better way.</p>
<p>If Japan can establish a theory and method that can enable China and Japan to justly cooperate and coexist and co-prosper, then China will naturally be happy to accept it. Currently, the goal of the Chinese people is only to resist Japan, that is, to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism. If Japan is not an imperialist country and does not invade China, then the Chinese people will lose their "resistance" target, and Sino-Japanese cooperation will be no problem. Therefore, my basic understanding of solving the Sino-Japanese problem is still to hope that Japan will "seek the cause within itself." The Chinese people will never make their neighbors a drain on resources by demanding that Japan invade places outside of China. The Chinese people will never whine and complain, begging Japan to pity their poverty and weakness. As for the method of using arsenic to poison a tiger to death (note the method), it is certainly not what the Chinese people want. What the Chinese people want to strive for is to seek "life" from death. Anything that helps China's "life," the Chinese people will do their best to seek it.</p>
<p>Finally, I must fully agree with Mr. Yamazaki's criticism of China's current construction goals. He said: "If China wants to completely break away from the extremely deep shackles of the imperialist powers and complete a truly modern nation... then, in order to resist the oppression of the powers, it must first prepare modern armaments. Behind these armaments, it must seek the thoroughness of national education, and it must greatly expand production capacity." Mr. Yamazaki also pointed out with his keen eye that China's current construction of many high-rise buildings and the like (examples omitted) "is not what a government that advocates working hard and tasting gall should do," "this is just a new form of the Ideology of the Summer Palace." Now I want to reiterate my old saying here to end this article. My understanding of China's construction goals many years ago (at the time of the September 18th Incident) was: (see New China, Volume 2, Issue 2)</p>
<p>"First: China's construction, in terms of means, must be used to enhance the strength to oppose the aggression of the powers against China."</p>
<p>"Second: China's construction, in terms of mission, must promote productive enterprises, truly increase the income of the people, and improve the lives of the people."</p>
<p>And I believe that "any construction motivated by profiting from it, collecting donations and taxes, embellishing peace, and consolidating territory is not enough to save the country, but more than enough to destroy it; even all construction centered on facilitating consumption can similarly achieve the result of building the country to its ruin." In recent years, because of the step-by-step advance of Japanese imperialism and the extreme severity of the national crisis, I have even advocated that China should currently focus on national defense construction and supplement it with production construction. I once said: In today's world, "the predicament of agriculture, industry, and all trades, that is, the decline of the entire national economy, is certainly an important task that the current government authorities must try to salvage, but the inch-by-inch aggression of powerful enemies is an urgent matter that the current government authorities must try to break free from. From the former, the government must currently have construction aimed at promoting production and improving people's lives. From the latter, the government must have construction aimed at preparing to resist the enemy and preserve the life of the nation. Comparing the two, the latter is even more urgent." Now we should consider the extreme severity of the national crisis and the extremely dangerous state of the people, and concentrate everything on preparing for national salvation. In this war of resistance against the enemy, which concerns survival, being able to support a little longer, even for a moment, is the happiness of our country and the glory of the nation. If we fail to resist the enemy in the future, what will follow will be a longer and more arduous national liberation movement. In this movement, we will only have deeper destruction and absolutely no construction. If there is any, it will only be the construction of the front line of our people's liberation to fight the enemy in close combat." (See Political Review Weekly, No. 19). These words were originally my criticism of the government's "excessive construction," and can also be said to be my hopes for the government's "current construction." The ultimate goal of my hope that the government should focus on national defense construction and supplement it with production construction was to remove the current shackles of imperialism (especially Japanese imperialism). Therefore, there is no attempt to build China into an imperialist country through this kind of construction. Because of this, the method of construction is also different from that of the imperialists. This is probably not well understood by scholars who are generally dominated by the ideology of imperialism. I hope the people of the country will pay close attention to it.</p>

<h3>How to Safeguard National Sovereignty</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, the Italian-Japanese compromise was established. The secret plan of the aggressive front has become concrete. Under the blatant expression of the Fascist group, the threat to peaceful countries is self-evident. If our country, with its depleted remnants, and facing a chaotic situation, does not handle matters with care, it will easily be ensnared. Those who do not know say that the encirclement situation leaves no desire unfulfilled. Those who know say that the foundation of an independent country has its own conditions for survival. Everyone with a head on their shoulders has the idea of protecting their country and loving their family. If others treat us as if we are on the cutting board, and we are willing to be the fish and meat, even the most foolish would not do this. The facts created by ambitious people only show that they are working hard in vain.</p>
<p>The damage from aggression suffered by our country since the September 18th Incident is already well known to the world. The authorities, based on their profound love of peace, have spared no effort to exercise the greatest tolerance in order to gradually improve the situation. But they do not know that this wish is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. All they see is the situation getting worse. To this day, on the one hand, they are vigorously singing the high tune of adjusting national relations, and on the other hand, there is a trend that the Sui disturbances are difficult to clean up. And the face of the aggressive group is once again revealed to the world. The people of our country who have long been trampled upon, under this full understanding, what are their thoughts?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Sui incident, we knew that the bandits and puppets would not succeed. This is because the crisis has entered its final stage, and the nation may be destroyed. Except for the mad, most people will change their attitude and face the situation. From this, we can inspire the hearts of the people and encourage the preservation of integrity. Where there is righteousness, there is no turning back. Furthermore, from the internal perspective of the bandits and puppets, some are coerced temporarily, and some are confused by the temptation of profit, and then become accomplices of the tigers, harming their own kind. After all, their hearts are inwardly ashamed, and they have no determination to die. If the bandit army is a mob, it is obviously not the opponent of the national army. As a result, the bandits and puppets suffered repeated defeats in the battles of Taolin and Xinghe. After the victory, the Sui North National Army was able to attack and take down Bailing Temple. Although it was due to human effort, it was also due to the trend of circumstances. It is rumored that after the failure, the bandits and puppets are still planning a large-scale offensive, and a certain army has also prepared for an emergency deployment. Their intention to expand the disturbances is clearly visible. It is expected that the National Army will encounter more intense battles in its defense work in the future. It can be asserted.</p>
<p>Peace has its ultimate limit. This is the main idea expressed by our country's highest authorities in successive statements. And the declaration of maintaining territory is also well known throughout the country. The occurrence of the Sui war has already resulted in the continuous deployment of central troops. And since the spread of the Anti-Comintern Pact, our Foreign Ministry spokesman has repeatedly stated that it will not allow a third party to infringe on sovereignty. All of this is enough to show our authorities' determination to safeguard territory. In an independent country, sovereignty is more important than life. We must not listen to the arbitrary picking up of excuses by third parties, and easily yield to each other. Suppressing bandits does not matter what the background is. Preventing communism should be based on self-reliance. These two points are the key points stated by our authorities, and also the minimum requirements of the people. They are natural and just, and there is nothing to criticize. If unfortunately there is a fact of infringement of sovereignty, we will resist it with the strength of the whole country. We will not refuse any sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Luo Qi's Annotation: Will Exert Utmost Effort to Promote Pacifism to Keep the Western Hemisphere Permanently Free from War; Expand the Scope of Commercial Reciprocity</h3>
<p>(Washington) Government leaders today claimed that President Roosevelt has obtained the support of the majority of the people for his policies, and has also initiated the Pan-American Peace Conference, and has therefore become the most powerful pacifist among world politicians. In his speech in Chautauqua in mid-June of this year, Luo made great efforts to express his aversion to war, and said that the United States should not be dragged into other countries' war vortexes no matter what. Therefore, State Department officials expect that next year the government will make more efforts to keep the United States away from the political disputes of various countries in the world. First, the government will continue to implement reciprocal commercial plans. There are now fourteen countries that have concluded reciprocal commercial agreements with the United States, and the scope of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment will be expanded in the future, so that all countries in the world can be treated equally in commerce. Second, to consolidate the peace mechanism of the twenty-one countries in the Western Hemisphere, not only will there be no possibility of war in the Western Hemisphere forever, but also the American countries will form a united front to oppose participation in wars elsewhere. Third, to increase the strength of existing neutrality laws, expand the president's discretionary powers, so that all war supplies can be prohibited from being transported to belligerent countries. Government officials are quite hopeful that the Pan-American Peace Conference will improve the peace mechanism in the Western Hemisphere, but they also frankly admit that the reciprocal commercial plan and the neutrality law will have a more rapid and far-reaching impact on world peace. The recently established exchange rate stabilization agreement has made countries that have always ignored reciprocal commercial agreements also have the hope of concluding agreements. It is reported that Japan is also considering participating in the exchange rate agreements of countries such as Britain, France, and the United States. (National Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Italy De Facto Recognizes Manchukuo; Sino-Italian Relations Greatly Affected; No Need for Japan and Italy to Conclude a Political Agreement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is believed here that Rome's announcement of establishing a consulate general in Harbin and asking "Manchukuo" to recognize its consulate, and not establishing an embassy in Changchun, is a de facto recognition of the Manchukuo organization, not a de jure recognition. Observers here point out that this action has a great impact on Italy's position in the international community and on Sino-Italian relations. The Japanese Foreign Ministry informally stated that the Japanese-Italian negotiations began six months ago, and Italy's attitude was only recently decided. The above-mentioned actions, as well as Japan's withdrawal of its embassy in Abyssinia and the recognition of Italy's new title of empire, are not reciprocal conditions, so there is no need to conclude a political agreement. That is, the issue of Japan's economic rights and interests in Abyssinia is currently under discussion, and there is no need to sign an agreement hastily. It is generally believed that Japan and Italy seem to be planning a new agreement to adjust the reciprocal tariffs on specific goods between the two countries.

<h3>Exchanging Economic Interests; Italy and Japan are Negotiating</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Italian government has publicly announced the establishment of a consulate in "Manchukuo" and the respect for Japan's rights and interests in Abyssinia. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has not yet received a telegram. The Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities issued a statement on this matter, saying that the Italian government hopes to establish a consulate in "Manchukuo," and the Japanese side also plans to withdraw its embassy in Abyssinia and replace it with a consulate. Regarding this issue and the request to ensure Japan's economic rights and interests in Abyssinia, which are of great importance to this, Japan and Italy are indeed continuing negotiations, but no telegram has been received that the negotiations have been concluded. Also, regarding the mutual recognition of "Manchukuo" and Abyssinia, there has been no discussion of any kind so far. If the Italian government's announcement is indeed true, then it can be considered that Italy's establishment of a consulate is a de facto recognition. (Allied Telegram on the 29th)</p>
<h3>German-Japanese Economic Cooperation to Promote Trade Relations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the conclusion of the Japanese-German Anti-Comintern Pact, how will the alliance between the two countries affect the economic relations between Japan, Germany, and "Manchukuo"? This is worth paying attention to. However, with the German-"Manchukuo" Trade Agreement as the pivot, the promotion of trade between the three countries, the combination of Germany's excellent technology and Japanese and Manchukuo capital enterprises, and the cooperation of the Japanese and German shipping industries will unfold new prospects. The German-"Manchukuo" Trade Agreement, which took effect on June 1, Germany's imports to Manchukuo had already reached 20 million yuan within three months of June, July, and August, plus the 25 million yuan of the trade agreement year trade settled after June 1, totaling 45 million yuan. Compared with 32 million yuan in the same period last year, the agreement has a significant effect. Since the time when Manchukuo's special products are on the market in October, Manchukuo's exports have increased even more. Therefore, by the end of May next year, Germany's imports to Manchukuo will inevitably break through the agreement amount of 100 million yuan. Therefore, Manchukuo's obligation to import from Germany must also reach the agreement's maximum amount of 25 million yuan. Therefore, Manchukuo will also strive to promote imports from Germany in the future. On the other hand, Japan, due to its huge national defense budget, in order to supplement the shortage of Japanese military industrial production capacity and the expansion of production equipment, its necessary machinery imports will inevitably increase, so as a result, most of it will have to rely on Germany.

<h3>French Foreign Minister Meets with Japanese Ambassador to Inquire About the Truth of the German-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos met with Japanese Ambassador Sato today to discuss various issues involved in the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern" Agreement. (Havas Telegram from Paris on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Mouthpiece Speaks Out Against Communism; Praises German-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The National Farmers' Congress held its final meeting in Goslar this morning. The speech was delivered by Minister Without Portfolio Hess, Hitler's representative for party affairs, who said that the anti-communist agreement established between Germany and Japan was of great importance, and there was no lack of intention to comfort other countries. He said, "The reason why Bolshevism hates Germany and focuses its attention on Germany is because Germany has already become the center of anti-Bolshevik action. Germany knows that what the Third International seeks is to destroy the barrier established by Germany. Fortunately, Hitler and Japan have established an anti-communist agreement, which has contributed much to peace." It is rumored that Germany wants to alienate the national flags of various countries, which is not a true statement. On the contrary, we are willing to see the unity of the nationalities of all countries, regardless of their political system, so as to jointly resist the "poison criminals." Jewish rioters in Soviet Russia have imposed the prison uniform of Bolshevism on national nationalities. Germany and Japan have had to establish an anti-communist agreement to check and deal with it, which is regrettable." It is also not a true statement that Germany wants to force other national nationalities to adopt its own political system, that is, the political system of the National Socialist Party. Because the Third International seeks to force the nationalities of various countries to accept its political concepts, Germany hopes that these nationalities will rise up to resist it. "Although, if it is said that Germany must wait for other countries to join this anti-communist agreement before taking self-defense measures, then it is a big mistake. Fortunately, there are no lack of far-sighted politicians in various countries who know how to protect their motherland and prevent it from being harmed by Bolshevism."

<h3>Comparison of Naval Power between Italy, Germany, Britain, and France; Italy and Germany Actively Building Ships</h3>
<p>(Paris) A naval reporter for the Petit Parisien recently discussed the impact of the understanding established between Germany, Italy, and Japan on the major naval powers, and compared the naval shipbuilding programs of Italy, Germany, Britain, and France.</p>
<p>(A) Italy's actively progressing shipbuilding program includes 46 warships of various types, with a total tonnage of 117,000 tons. The most important ones include: (1) two 35,000-ton battleships; (2) 24 submarines with a total of 15,000 tons.</p>
<p>(B) The total tonnage of the German navy can reach 300,000 tons in a short period of time, of which 70,000 tons is the total tonnage of existing ships, and the remaining 230,000 tons belong to new ships, which will be completed in four years. The distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The shipbuilding program for 1934-315 has 54,500 tons, of which two 26,000-ton battleships are built according to the style of the battleship Scharnhorst, which was approved by Admiral Tirpitz of the European War. (2) The shipbuilding program for 935-36 has 72,000 tons, including three 10,000-ton cruisers and 26 submarines. (3) The shipbuilding program for 1936-37 has 98,700 tons, including one 35,000-ton battleship and two 20,000-ton aircraft carriers, whose speed should be 37 knots per hour. As for the shipbuilding program for 1937-38, it will be voted on and passed in a short period of time, and it will generally include several 35,000-ton battleships and many submarines. In summary, once the German navy completes the shipbuilding program for 1937-38, its strength can reach the limit stipulated in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which is 400,000 tons. (C) The United Kingdom is only building 150,000 tons of new ships. The shipbuilding program for 1936 has (1) 17 warships of various types (excluding submarines), totaling 124,000 tons (2) 4 submarines. In this way, the British navy's expansion plan is already slow compared to other countries.</p>
<p>(D) As for France, the shipbuilding program for 1937, in addition to one 8,000-ton cruiser, the rest are small warships of less than 2,000 tons, and there are no plans to add battleships. The purpose of this is to build a strong small fleet so that when Germany restores its submarine fleet in the future, it can be prepared. The French Navy Department originally planned to build two 8,000-ton cruisers, but because of financial difficulties, one was cancelled. The naval authorities believe that France must build two 8,000-ton cruisers in accordance with the original plan. In addition, many heavy destroyers should also be built, and the four battleships currently under construction should be accelerated to completion. (Havas Telegram on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Results of the Romanian-Polish Talks: Strengthen Existing Alliances; Both Parties Sign a Cultural Agreement; Romanian Foreign Minister Leaves Warsaw to Return Home</h3>
<p>Warsaw Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu came here a few days ago to visit and held talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. As a result, the two countries have signed a cultural cooperation agreement. Antonescu has completed his official duties and set off to return home. Regarding the course of the Romanian-Polish talks, the Polish government recently issued a communique saying, "The views of the two governments coincide, especially the alliance previously concluded between the two countries is completely in line with the sincere feelings of the two countries. The principles contained in the alliance will be maintained, so that the effectiveness of the alliance will be maintained in any new organization in Europe in the future, so that the two countries will benefit from it."

<h3>Former French Prime Minister's Impressions of England</h3>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Flandin recently returned from a visit to England and told a reporter from the Hard-Line newspaper, "The current international situation is very different from that of 1914. Before the Great War in 1914, Britain hesitated on its own position and was unwilling to clearly define it. Now, Foreign Secretary Eden, on behalf of the British government, has solemnly warned countries attempting to undermine peace in Western Europe. His tone is very firm. Therefore, politicians of all countries should know the close unity of Britain, France, and Belgium." Regarding the state of British military preparations, Flandin said, "Britain is not yet ready, which is also admitted by people in that country. However, in eighteen months, the British Air Force will become the most powerful air force in the world. As for the navy, it has also undergone many technical improvements. The efficiency of the British Home Fleet has greatly increased compared to before." Finally, regarding the Spanish problem, he said that the British Admiralty advocated that the government should recognize the Spanish Nationalist forces as belligerents to avoid disputes in the Mediterranean. However, due to repeated opposition from the French government, it was abandoned. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Regent Visits Vienna</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy and his wife, along with their entourage, arrived here this morning at 10:00 am on a special train from Rome. President Miklas, Prime Minister Schuschnigg, and many senior officials welcomed them at the station. After Admiral Horthy disembarked, he was accompanied by President Miklas to review the guard of honor. Nearby residents cheered and paid their respects. They then drove together to the Imperial Hotel. Admiral Horthy also visited President Miklas at the Presidential Palace at 11:00 am. Shortly afterward, the President returned the visit to the entourage. Admiral Horthy then went to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the European War and laid a wreath before the tomb of the late Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>The Trip to Rome Did Not Yield Concrete Results</h3>
<p>Budapest Most newspapers here believe that the visit of Regent Admiral Horthy to Italy has not yielded concrete results. Even regarding the economic negotiations between Italy and Hungary, the aim was to find ways to adapt the provisions of the Rome Protocols between Italy, Austria, and Hungary to the situation after the devaluation of the Italian lira. (This means that after the devaluation of the lira, the tax rate on Hungarian imports should be reduced to compensate for the loss in exchange rates. This matter has not yet been fully agreed upon. It is now generally hoped that the sincere atmosphere created by the meeting between Admiral Horthy and Prime Minister Mussolini will easily enable Hungary to obtain substantial benefits.

<h3>Litvinov's Speech Severely Criticizes Fascism Germany and Italy Collude with Japan, Enemies of Peace The Soviet Navy Shows Astonishing Development</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov delivered an impassioned speech at the All-Union Congress today, attacking Italy and Germany. Litvinov declared that after fifteen months of negotiations, the two countries have completed a secret military alliance. He learned from extremely reliable sources that Italy has proposed the same agreement to Japan. Mussolini regards this as the best way to retaliate against the Soviet Union's faithful opposition to Italy's violation of the League of Nations. He is fully confident that the Soviet Union is capable of independently resisting any enemy country or combined enemies. However, at the same time, Russia should fight for peace without seeking to join any group or combine with other countries. The Soviet Union will wait quietly for other countries to judge the value of the benefits gained from cooperating with the Soviet Union in managing peace. Litvinov also severely criticized the National Socialist Party, saying that they seem unmoved by the fact that General Franco is leading Moorish troops of non-Aryan descent to brutally kill pure Aryan people. Litvinov scoffed at the rumors that the Soviet Union intends to implement communism in Spain so that Spain can join the Soviet Union. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The leader of the Soviet Red Navy, First-Rank Fleet Commander Orlov, gave a speech at the Soviet Congress, discussing the arms race among imperialist countries, specifically pointing out the expansion of the navies of Japan, Germany, and Italy. He said, "Faced with the increasingly accelerated danger of a new imperialist war, especially the threats from Germany and Japan, although we are determined not to build a navy for aggression, we must create a strong self-defense sea lane and naval air force and coastal defense facilities. We have successfully created these self-defense tools in recent years."</p>
<p>"If we assume that the number of ships owned by our navy on January 1, 1933, was 100%, then by the end of 1936, our submarines had increased by 715%, other small warships jointly defending our coast with submarines had increased by 300%, the number of long-range artillery for coastal defense had increased by 75%, the number of anti-aircraft guns for air defense at naval bases had doubled, and the naval air force had expanded to 510%."</p>
<p>Orlov pointed out the excellent quality of Soviet naval soldiers and the outstanding performance of submarines, saying that they exceeded the prescribed technical standards. He then ended his speech in the full assembly's tidal wave of applause, saying, "Looking at the current entire international situation and all the events surrounding the Soviet Union in the capitalist world, we must build, and are currently building, a truly great navy, including warships of all grades with extremely high technical standards." (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Litvinov's Speech</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Litvinov delivered a speech at the Eighth Congress, lasting an hour and a half. Litvinov first discussed the nature of bourgeois liberal democracy, pointing out that "of the twenty-six bourgeois countries in Europe, only about ten still preserve so-called bourgeois liberal democracy. The rest are fascist or semi-fascist dictatorships. As for what freedom and democracy are like in fascist countries, there is no need to elaborate. "The Soviet Union has become the guarantee of freedom and democracy, but it does not initiate or organize international groups to resist fascism, which denies freedom and democracy. As a country, we do not ask about the internal fascist regimes of other countries. However, fascism has gone beyond the domestic affairs of various fascist countries. For many years, Mussolini, the initiator of fascism, did not include spreading fascism outside of Italy in his foreign policy. However, since Mussolini's Fascism was repaired in Berlin and injected with German National Socialist theory, the situation has changed. German National Socialism is different from Italian Fascism. After gaining a foothold domestically, it immediately expanded its activities abroad."</p>
<p>Litvinov continued that German Fascism has spy networks operating in almost every country in the world. He said that they not only promote Fascism to the people of the countries where they reside and carry out espionage work, but even conduct terrorist activities. Litvinov said, "This kind of spy network has recently been cracked down on in the Soviet Union. However, we are not alarmed by this kind of fascist activity. For other countries, it is a real and great danger, even endangering their existence. But for us, we can easily deal with it within our borders with our own strength. We do not need to ask for foreign assistance to resist it. We do not conclude international alliances and agreements for this purpose. (Laughter, applause)</p>
<p>"The activities of Fascism abroad, if they take the form of the current situation in Spain, are even more serious." Litvinov cited examples, detailing the actions of German and Italian Fascism in assisting Spain and the organization of the London Non-Intervention Committee. Li Min stated the Soviet Union's faithful compliance with its promise of non-intervention in Spain's internal affairs and the ineffectiveness of the Soviet Union's repeated urging of the committee to find ways to implement the resolutions. Litvinov said that the London Committee meant that non-intervention meant that the committee itself did not interfere with the intervention of others.</p>
<p>"This kind of resolution of the London Committee gives prior approval to all future violations of the alliance by fascist countries. Therefore, the Soviet government has had to faithfully declare to the committee that the Soviet government is not morally more bound by the agreement than other signatory countries. As a result of German and Italian aid to the rebels, for several weeks now, thousands of kilograms of bombs have been dropped day and night on the beautiful capital of the Spanish people. Thousands of peaceful people, women, and children are being slaughtered every day, and the best treasures of mankind, such as buildings, paintings, sculptures, etc., are being destroyed. Those who carry out this destruction are German and Italian planes and pilots. This destruction is done by the First Fascist International of Germany and Italy. Their active cooperation will forever be the most shameful page in the history of international relations and European history. (Applause, shouts of "Fair and reasonable")</p>
<p>"The entire assembly must agree with me that when we talk about Spain here, our thoughts and emotions are filled with genuine sympathy and admiration, and have already flown to the heroic defenders of Madrid and all the brave soldiers of the Spanish Republican Army who are fighting bravely against the forces of barbarism and destruction." (A tidal wave of applause, the entire assembly finally applauds the Spanish ambassador sitting in the diplomatic section) Litvinov continued, "The enemy is now spreading rumors arbitrarily, saying that we want to create a Communist Soviet state on the Pyrenees Peninsula and want to incorporate it into the Soviet Union (laughter). This is a fairy tale woven for ignorant children and adult fools (laughter and applause). Its purpose is naturally to obscure our true intentions regarding the Spanish incident. Our true intention is that this incident is the first time that Fascism has crossed the border of a亡国and attempted to cultivate a Spanish Fascist regime with foreign force. If this attempt succeeds, the scope will inevitably be expanded and implemented in other countries.</p>
<p>"Our starting point must be this fact, that Fascism is not only a special domestic regime, but also a preparation for aggression and war against other countries. We are a country that firmly advocates international peace, but why do we pay so much attention to this attempt to cultivate Fascism and an aggressive consciousness in other countries with foreign force? Due to all the above facts, it is very clear that the reason why Fascism focuses its attacks on the Soviet Union is not because of the so-called "propagation of communism," but because the Soviet Union itself is the target of Fascism's aggressive desires and an obstacle to aggression from other parties.</p>
<p>"Fascism has become isolated because it cannot find friendly troops within the League of Nations members who still advocate a collective security system. It has turned to a small number of countries that share aggressive goals and formed a group with them, claiming to deeply resist the "danger of international communism." To be precise, I should point out that the group formed is not common, but is separately made up of Germany and Italy and Germany and Japan. However, we still have definite information that Italy has also suggested to Japan to conclude an agreement similar to a part of the already announced German-Japanese agreement.</p>
<p>"The creators of this anti-communist international agreement obviously did not pay attention to how ridiculous their desire for others to believe that their agreement is truly ideological in nature is. Informed people will never believe that to conclude the simple two articles of the German-Japanese agreement that have already been announced requires fifteen months of long negotiations, and that the Japanese negotiating representative must be a military general, and the German side must be a super diplomat, and that the negotiations must be carried out in an extremely secret atmosphere.</p>
<p>"It is believable that some people suspect that the German-Japanese agreement is written in a special code. For example, the Japanese warlords in Manchuria interpret the code at will, breaking the long silence on the Soviet-"Manchurian" border and invading the Soviet territory twice with strong force within two days. They did not expect that the Berlin agreement could not prohibit the Red Army in the Far East from giving the same answer as before the invasion. (The whole audience cheers, unanimously rising to cheer Marshal Blucher, the commander-in-chief of the Far East Army, who is sitting in the presidium) We hope that when the Japanese warlords in Manchuria carry back the wounded and count the corpses and ordnance left in Soviet territory after the contact, they should realize this point. We hope that although the Japanese warlords in Manchuria have obtained the Berlin agreement, they should still remember the advice of the Red Army in the Far East, "When you take a walk, please find a more distant and secluded path." (Laughter and applause)</p>
<p>"The already announced German-Japanese agreement is actually just a mask for another agreement, which was negotiated, signed, and even initialed at the same time, but has not been announced and is not prepared to be announced. I am deeply aware of the responsibility of my speech, but I still declare that the Japanese military attaché and the German super diplomat spent fifteen months negotiating this secret document, which did not mention the word communism. "The recent activities of fascist countries, among other things, have completely exposed the hypocrisy and deception of certain political declarations and slogans that they claim to represent their political programs. For example, German Fascism has declared that in principle it opposes any international alliances and groups, except for non-aggression agreements, and that such agreements can only be concluded with neighboring countries. However, it has now concluded an agreement with Japan, and it is not a non-aggression agreement, and Japan is tens of thousands of kilometers away from Germany, separated by many countries. German Fascism has sworn to abide by the principle of localizing wars. However, the tendency of the German-Japanese agreement will involve wars in one continent to at least two continents.</p>
<p>"After annexing Abyssinia, Italy declared that its territorial desires had been satisfied and declared that it would cooperate to maintain peace in the future. However, it is now joining an aggressive agreement. The reputation and sincerity of the Japanese government have not been proven any better. It has repeatedly declared to us that it wants to establish peaceful relations with us and make us try to satisfy its desires regarding certain issues. However, it is now concluding a secret aggression agreement with Germany. The Japanese government has also declared to us that the non-aggression agreement we proposed is still under discussion and can be signed after all disputed issues are resolved. However, it is now making the conclusion of this agreement conditional on prior recognition by Germany, reducing the independence of its diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>"The anti-democratic fascist aggressor countries have stated their attitude. They have declared that they are unwilling to participate in international cooperation to protect peace and guarantee human security. They have repeatedly challenged peaceful countries, especially democratic countries. Now is the time for these countries to state their attitude. The Soviet Union believes that it has no reason to change its policy. Its policy is still a policy of peace (long applause). The Soviet Union hopes to share peace with other countries and therefore proposes cooperation to all countries. What the Soviet Union expects from all countries is not empty talk of peace, but actions to organize peace.</p>
<p>"However, the Soviet Union does not beg to join any alliances, any groups, any unions. The Soviet Union quietly allows other countries to estimate the benefits of close cooperation with the Soviet Union for peace, and understands that what the Soviet Union can give is more than it takes (applause). The conclusion of the agreements we are talking about today actually does not change anything in the actual world. The danger is not in the agreement, nor in the signatures under the agreement, but in the existence of certain countries whose governments' foreign policies are based on destroying peace and on aggression and looting. They are working hard to seize everything that is not closely protected. However, this does not shock us, because we have nothing that is not well protected. The greatest danger is to other countries and other industries. Our security is not in a piece of paper or in foreign unions. The Soviet Union itself is strong enough, and its power will be further consolidated by the strong cohesion of the new constitution that the Congress is about to pass."</p>
<p>Litvinov finally ended his speech in a thunderous applause and cheers from the entire audience, saying, "We firmly believe that if a day comes that forces our army and navy to rise up to defend the motherland, then our military Stakhanovism, coupled with the enthusiasm that this kind of opportunity will inevitably generate, will allow the world to see unprecedented and unheard-of boundless heroism and courage. The Soviet Union will stand tall and indestructible in the turbid sea of Fascism, shattering its layers of turbid waves. The leadership and key to this fortress are held in the hands of a commander-in-chief like our great leader Stalin, whose confidence is even stronger." (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Great Northern Railway on the Soviet Far East Border is Open to Traffic From Moscow to Vladivostok Militarily Important</h3>
<p>Moscow News, according to the announcement of the All-Soviet Congress, the world's most important and direct Soviet Great Northern Railway to the Pacific Ocean has been completed. The route starts from Moscow and ends in Vladivostok. The first train was opened on the 26th. The track runs parallel to the Northwest Siberian Railway, but the difference is that one is on the Soviet border and the other is in the center of Soviet territory. It is an important help to the Soviet Union in dealing with Japanese attacks on national defense. (Translated by Foreign Affairs Agency from Zilin News)</p>
<h3>Artillery Mutiny in Ecuador Minister of the Interior Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The Calderón artillery regiment in the capital of Ecuador recently mutinied today and kidnapped the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Béjar. The government sent troops to suppress the rebels. After four hours of fighting, order was restored. The rebels had no fighting spirit because they had no one to command them. They surrendered unconditionally. All the rebel soldiers and accomplices were interrogated by a military court. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The War Around Madrid Becomes Quiet Rainfall for Days Fills Trenches with Water The Government Forces on the Northwest Front Take the Offensive</h3>
<p>Madrid Continuous rainfall has turned the trenches around Madrid into muddy ditches, causing both sides' land and air forces to be at a standstill. Gasset El Campo has also turned into a large swamp with floating debris. Due to the weather, only small conflicts occurred in the city of Madrid yesterday. According to semi-official accounts of the war around Madrid, the Nationalist forces have indeed been forced to change the distribution of their troops to cope with the various threats from the government forces. According to the government's announcement, the Nationalist forces have not advanced a step in the northwest area of Madrid. There has been large-scale development of government forces on the Tagus front. When the government forces' bombs fell on the Talavera airfield, they destroyed a Nationalist three-engine Junkers aircraft and a chase plane. The Nationalist forces initially tried to reinforce the positions on the riverbank, but were now forced to abandon them and flee. Half of Talavera is on fire. According to the Madrid Defense Committee, the enemy's military strength has gradually weakened since Moorish troops were replaced by volunteers who could not take the charge. In the past four days, twelve Nationalist tanks have been destroyed, and another five have been damaged and cannot be used. The government also claimed that the government forces had won a victory in Oviedo in northern Spain. The method of attack of the militia there was excellent, and they had occupied several villages and cut off the road from Grado, where the local rebel headquarters is located, to Oviedo. On the other hand, the Nationalist forces claimed that they had bombed several towns such as Malaga and damaged many ships in the port of Malaga. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Madrid It is learned here that the most fierce battle since the civil war began in Asturias Province today. Both sides used planes and tanks, and fought each other in hand-to-hand combat. It was an unprecedented offensive by the government forces to occupy Oviedo and kill the commander of the Nationalist forces, General Aranda. Government leaders claimed that communication between the Nationalist forces and Oviedo had been cut off, and that since the Nationalist forces in Madrid had also failed to advance, the position of the government forces had greatly improved. (28th National Telegram (Son of Spanish Prime Minister)</p>
<p>Santander Port in the Northwest (in the hands of the government forces) The government forces are now advancing towards Burgos, the seat of the Nationalist government, and have occupied a high ground to control the village of Solsillo (65 kilometers from Burgos). In this area, a total of 300 Nationalist officers and soldiers have been killed and 15 captured since the 3rd. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Valencia Manufactures Propaganda Shells Distributes Leaflets Advising Rebels</h3>
<p>Madrid The city of Valencia is a world-famous producer of fireworks. The government forces authorities are now ordering the fireworks makers there to manufacture a kind of "propaganda shell" that can release more than a thousand leaflets, using both Spanish and Arabic languages, advising the rebel soldiers not to be misled by their generals. Once this shell is made, it will be used. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Spanish War Zone Full of Desolation Millions of Lives Lost</h3>
<p>British Parliamentary Group Makes Humanitarian Appeal</p>
<p>(London) The British representative group of the tour to the Spanish war zone today issued a petition from the British chargé d'affaires, urging rapid international action to alleviate the unspeakable pain of Madrid. The text said, "We have stayed for several days in Barcelona, the seat of the Spanish government, Valencia, and Madrid, and the authorities have given us all kinds of conveniences to see everything. We now dare to publish an article and appeal to the world, whether the civilian disaster in Madrid has been fully realized. We still have doubts about this. We do not want to criticize the war situation, but we have to tell the world that millions of lives in the city are subjected to land and air bombing every day. The whole city is now heavily besieged, with only one road left open. In the past twenty-one days, this is the only way to communicate with the outside world. The government is unable to care for itself, let alone the civilians. The city originally had a million residents, and now it has tens of thousands more refugees. There are areas in the city that have been destroyed and are uninhabitable. Countless civilians have died, and they are now starving due to a lack of food, and the arrival of epidemics seems inevitable. Neutral countries should now urgently carry out large-scale disaster relief work by international organizations. Women, children, and non-combatants in the city should be sent out of the country. Those who remain should be provided with food to alleviate the unspeakable pain that cannot be stopped by force." The representative group includes two Conservative members of the House of Commons, one Liberal member, and three Labour members. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>A Summary of Chairman Lin's Return to Fujian: Mawei Naval Guns Fire a Welcome Salute; Yesterday, He Returned with Clansmen to His Hometown to Sweep the Tombs</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chairman Lin of the National Government returned to Fujian from Nanjing on the 23rd of this month aboard the Hai Chou warship to visit and sweep the tombs in his hometown of Shanggan. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government immediately convened the heads of political, military, police, and educational institutions on the 24th through the Security Department, and decided on two measures: security and welcome, which were arranged separately. At 9 a.m. on the 26th, the Hai Chou warship arrived at the Luoxing Pagoda pier in Mawei. The heads of party, government, and military institutions in the provincial capital all went to Mawei to welcome him. All warships anchored on the river fired a 21-gun salute, and the naval band played music to show their respect. Representatives of various groups and students from various schools gathered on both sides of Tonggu Tower on the way to Fuma Road to welcome him. From Luoxing Pagoda, through Fuma Road, to the Cangqianshan area, the Gendarmerie Regiment, Security Regiment, Police Team, and Naval Training Camp were stationed at guard posts and sentries. All institutions, schools, social groups, and shops in the city raised flags, and memorial arches were built and slogans hung on important streets to express welcome. After Chairman Lin arrived on the Hai Chou warship, he greeted the officials who boarded the ship to welcome him, and then disembarked and took a car to the province. When passing Tonggu Tower, he specially got out of the car and walked half a li, nodding to the welcoming crowd on both sides. At 10 a.m., he arrived at his private residence at Chengpu Pier in Cangqianshan (the official residence arranged by the provincial government). The heads of party, government, and military institutions all escorted him to the residence before leaving. In the afternoon, the members of the provincial government and provincial party headquarters, as well as Chairman Lin's old friends in the province, all went to the residence to pay their respects. In the evening, the provincial government sent a banquet to the residence to welcome Chairman Lin. At 7 a.m. on the 27th, Chairman Lin went from the residence to inspect the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government. Because he learned that Chen Yi, the chairman of the provincial government, was ill, he personally went to Chen's bedroom to express his condolences and talked for a while before leaving the government office to visit West Lake Park. At 11 a.m., he went to Meiting outside the West Gate to pay his respects at the tomb of his deceased younger brother. At 12 noon, he had lunch at Yixin Building in Hongshan Bridge. At 1 p.m., he took a car into the city and went to Baihe Exercise Hall to bathe. He then visited Sa Zhenbing on the way.

At 7 a.m. on the 28th, Hong Fasui and other members of the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce went to the residence to pay their respects. He received them and inquired about the commercial situation and financial conditions. At about 9 a.m., Chairman Lin ordered a car to visit Chen Peikun, a standing committee member of the relief committee in Zhuzi Lane, and accompanied Chen to visit the historical sites and scenic spots of Quanshan, hosted by Gao Dengting, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Chen Ticheng, Director of the Department of Construction. Then he went to Yushan Qigong Temple to pay his respects and visited the Woodworking Training Institute. He returned to the residence at 12 noon. At about 2 p.m., he went to Luban Temple to visit. It was decided that at 6 a.m. on the 29th, he would return to his ancestral home in Shanggan Township with clansmen Lin Qilian and others to pay respects at the ancestral tombs. The Naval Command prepared the Haiping small steamer to wait in Xiadou for the ride, and decided to inspect Fenghang Elementary School on the 30th, and then go to Qingzhi Temple in Guantou for a rest.

<h3>After the Ban on Anhui Rice, the Wuhu Rice Market is Active, and Tens of Thousands of Stones will be Exported</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Since the Anhui Provincial Government banned the export of rice and grain from the province, it has caused a strong reaction from rice merchants. Therefore, the ban method was changed to restrict the concentration of rice and grain in central and southern Anhui in Wuhu for inspection and release. Hundreds of rice boats detained in Hexian Yuxikou and other places downstream were able to arrive here. From all over the region, there was a large congregation of merchant ships. The Guangchao, Yanjin and other rice merchants stationed in Wuhu also made large purchases. The rice market, which had been stagnant along the way, became very active again. In the past three days, the city's transactions have reached more than 60,000 packages, breaking the highest daily sales record this year. Although the source is so enthusiastic, the price of rice has increased day by day. The central government has issued an order that food can be circulated domestically, which also has great power. It is reported that Guangbang will purchase 400,000 stones in Wuhu, and huge sums of money and passports have been sent. Chao Bang also has a large number of purchase and transportation passports to Wuhu. The iron ships to be transported are already on the way. It is expected that not only will a huge number of rice grains be exported from Wuhu this month, but the future market price will still have an upward trend. In the past two days, the average price of various types of rice has increased by two or three corners per stone. Nanling Gaoji is now selling for 8 yuan and 67 corners, medium for 8 yuan and 34 corners, and ordinary for 8 yuan and 12 corners. The price of Wuhu Nanguan Gaoji is also the same. Brown rice is sold for 7 yuan and 56 corners. However, the measure of exporting Anhui rice with visa release seems not to have received the clear order from the central government that rice and grain can be circulated domestically. Therefore, yesterday, Datong also had rice boats that had not applied for a visa detained by the Public Security Bureau of the area, which sent patrols to the Jiangmian waters of Datongzhouwei Yangpeng. A total of 11 sailing boats, about 4,500 stones of grain, were detained. Rice merchant Li claimed that it was transported to Wuhu for sale, but the bureau temporarily detained it because there was no way to prove it, and it will be submitted to the provincial government for review. It is expected that it can be resolved and released within a few days. (28th)</p>
<h3>The Drought in Northern Anhui is Terrible, with the Disaster Area Spreading to More Than 20 Counties, and Disaster Victims are Displaced and Urgently Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Northern Anhui is located in the Huai River Basin. In the past peaceful times, it was rich in products and people lived and worked in peace and contentment. Since the situation has been turbulent and disasters have occurred frequently, people's livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. After the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the social economy has become increasingly decadent, and the countryside is devastated, which is the case in all counties. In recent years, the situation has deteriorated, and it has become a common phenomenon. There was a severe drought last summer, and there was a spring famine this year. Refugees fill the roads, and nine out of ten families are empty. Fortunately, the mid-season wheat harvest this year was abundant, and the grain market was active, and farmers had the opportunity to recover. However, since entering autumn, there has been little rainfall, and all regions have suffered from severe drought. The autumn harvest has been reduced, and grain prices have soared. The authorities have banned grain from leaving the country, and the grain market has been stagnant invisibly. However, the recent market price of Feihe Huamai and Shouxian Hongmai is still above 17 yuan and 6 corners per stone, and the market price of soybeans has also risen to 14 yuan and 5 corners. The drought is terrible, and the disaster area is expanding. More than three months have passed, and there has been no heavy rain. The fields are cracked and the land is scorched for thousands of miles. The disaster area covers more than 20 counties, among which Taihe, Fuyang, Linquan, Huoqiu, Guoyang, Haoxian, Mengcheng, Suxian, and Lingbi are the most terrible. Shouxian, Yingshang, Fengtai, Dingyuan, Huaiyuan, Fengyang, Sixian, Wuhe, and Suyi are also affected. According to a survey of farmers, it is learned that 50 to 60 percent of farmers have planted wheat, but only half of them have sprouted. In areas that have suffered from severe drought, no planting has taken place. According to experienced farmers, even if there is a good rainfall now, the planting period for wheat has passed, and even if it is replanted, the harvest next year will be reduced, and it may even lead to a poor year. Yesterday (26th), the gale raged all day, and the flying sand was pervasive, and the sky was dim, as if deliberately fueling the drought. At this time of severe drought, the water level of the Huai River is also decreasing day by day. The riverbed is silted up, and small boats are stranded from time to time. Now it is impossible to operate the ferries. The steamer from Bengbu can only reach Xinchengkou. The Changhuai transportation has been interrupted invisibly, and the shipping industry is depressed, and the sailors are suffering. As early winter arrives, the weather is cold, and countless disaster victims come to Bengbu in groups to flee the famine, crying for hunger and cold, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew. Most of them are dressed in rags and have haggard faces. They beg along the streets, and their cries are miserable. It is learned that the local authorities and charitable organizations in various counties have appealed to the local government for relief for the disaster victims. (27th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Fellow Villagers in Beijing Telegraph Anhui, Requesting Protection of Jiangxi Merchants' Property Rights Regarding the Issue of Recovering the Linjiang Wharf in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Linjiang Wharf in Wuhu is the location for the loading and unloading of timber by the Jiangxi Qingjiang Timber Industry in Wuhu. Previously, the Wuhu Construction Committee ordered the relocation due to the construction of the riverbank. The industry claimed that it owned the property rights, and that more than 7,000 people in the Xiaojiang industry and commerce depended on this for their livelihood. Therefore, it specially dispatched representatives Wu Zhonghuan and others to Beijing to petition, and Li Liejun and other Jiangxi fellow villagers in Beijing rose up to provide assistance and telegraphed all parties for help. The telegram is recorded as follows: "Chairman Liu of the Anhui Provincial Government, all members, Inspector Miao, Director Liu of the Department of Construction, Commissioner Gao of the Wuhu Branch, and the Construction Committee: More than 7,000 Jiangxi merchants and workers in our province are subordinate to Tangjiang and rely on your shelter to live in peace. Your benevolent governance is known to all. Now, we have heard that due to the construction of the revetment, you want to take all the riverfront property owned by Jiangxi people in Wuhu. We admire your wise governance, and we believe that this will not happen. The central government is concerned about the people's difficulties and has repeatedly granted guarantees. We sincerely request that you treat Jiangxi people's property and Jiangxi workers' lives equally to promote this intention. We believe that you will treat the people as if they were injured and will be able to take care of everything. We send this telegram for your consideration.

At 8:28 pm on the 28th, two bandits suddenly came, speaking in a strong northern accent, and holding pistols. One bandit stood at the entrance to guard, and the other bandit entered to rob. While they were confronting each other, the bandit guarding the wind suddenly fired a shot to show off. The shop owner Hu Ziliang then put all the cash he had made for the day, totaling 86 yuan and 5 fen in national currency, on the counter. After the bandit grabbed it, he ran away through the alley. After the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the General Bureau's Detective Team learned of the alarm, they immediately led a large number of police officers to pursue and arrest them, but they were not successful. On the 29th, the residents of the area petitioned the General Bureau to take strict precautions to avoid future troubles.</p>
<h3>Danyang: A Student Strike at Mingfeng Elementary School</h3>
<p>Zhu Menglian, the director of instruction at the county-run Mingfeng Elementary School, was recently accused by Hao Shuying, the principal of the school, to the Education Bureau of inciting a student strike and sabotaging the school, resulting in her suspension. Zhu has not been to school for several days after receiving the order. The students of the school went to the Education Bureau to ask for the revocation of the order in order to retain Zhu. It is learned that the students have become more agitated because their petition has not been satisfied.

<h3>Nantong: The Chongqi Public Land Case is Resolved</h3>
<p>After the separation of Chongming and Qidong counties, the dispute over public land has not been resolved for a long time. Xu Xuan, Jiang Nanchun, and Ha Yinlan were commissioned by the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction to come to Tong to mediate. On the 28th, representatives of the two counties were convened at the special office for mediation. A solution was discussed and decided. The public land of the two counties, those in Chongming belong to Chongming, and those in Qidong belong to Qidong. However, the 1.32 million mu of Haitang public land and the Yuying public land located in Qidong, 400,000 mu were selected to be managed by Chongming. After the 19th year of the Republic of China, the excess rent collected by Qidong and the 10,000 yuan that Chongming should pay to Qidong were exempted from further settlement and were transferred to Qidong for management. The public land allocated to Qidong was transferred from Chongming to Qidong for collection.

<h3>Ningbo: Prohibit Perming Hair and Strange Clothing</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of Yin County recently learned that the perming of hair and strange clothing by women has greatly hindered the future of the New Life Movement. Although the authorities have strictly banned it, the female relatives of civil servants still often violate the ban, which is not enough to promote etiquette and kindness.

<h3>New Business District on the South Bank of the Qiantang River</h3>

The area of the new commercial district on the south bank is 60 square kilometers, which is more than three times the area of Hangzhou city. After the survey team completes its work, it is expected that a major announcement can be made within three months. The southern end of the Qiantang River Bridge, the Jingjiang Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Jiangbian Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the Jiangbian Station of the Xiaoshao Highway are all included in the new commercial district, so the area is quite large. Regarding various constructions on the north bank, no actions will be taken for the time being. In the future, the commercial areas in Xiaoshan West and Jiangbian areas will be very lively.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Having read the news in your newspaper on November 28 about Zhang Changqi, the Special Commissioner for Land Tax Consolidation in Changshu, being placed under surveillance, I must state that this is not true. I have always been law-abiding and upright, and I have always been prudent in my conduct. The remittance was made with my personal savings from two years' salary, at sixty yuan per month. The claims of a subsequent remittance of five hundred yuan are also untrue. I am currently serving in my post as usual. I hope you will make a correction to avoid misunderstandings. Addressed to the Editors of Shen Bao, Zhang Changqi. 25th year, 11th month, 2nd day.</p>

<p>Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>This time, the bandits and puppets have launched a large-scale invasion of Suiyuan, attempting to seize all of Mongolia and nibble away at the western frontier. Fortunately, Governor Fu Zuoyi and all the soldiers of the province have fought bravely, causing the bandits to suffer defeat. However, Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, Zhuo Shishai, and others have willingly become lackeys and betrayed the nation, and they will surely gather their fleeing troops and continue their advance. Therefore, the upcoming fierce battles will not be far off. Suiyuan is the shield for Hebei and Shanxi. The bandits and puppets are acting on the orders of a certain country, and they are determined to seize it and bring it under their control. Then, they will take Mongolia in the north and spy on the Northwest in the south, in order to achieve their fixed policy. Therefore, the success or failure of the Suiyuan war is by no means a gain or loss in one area. It has a serious meaning for the survival of the entire nation and the country. Now, the guns, machinery and aircraft and other war weapons used by the bandits and puppets are all supplied by a certain country. According to recent telegraphic reports from various newspapers, a large number of poison gases have been transported to the front lines, preparing to be released and carried out for slaughter. Also according to recent telegrams from Guihua, in addition to leather clothing, what is currently urgently needed on the front lines is war zone rescue organization and anti-gas equipment. It can be seen that a scene of inhumanity is about to break out. Our northern warriors, in this vast snow and ice, are fighting for the survival of the nation and for the defense of the motherland. With regard to anti-gas equipment, it should be fully supplied to ensure safety and strengthen morale. In view of this, this association has united with all sectors of the city to establish this association, with the primary mission of launching a campaign to donate anti-gas equipment. It is hoped that with the greatest efforts, anti-gas masks can be collected and transported to the front lines in the shortest possible time. It is hoped that all fellow compatriots will be deeply concerned about the nation's danger, remember the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers, donate generously, and jointly save the crisis. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<p>Telegram to Encourage the Soldiers</p>
<p>The assembly also sent a telegram to encourage the soldiers fighting the bandits. The original text reads: "To Governor Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan, and forwarded to all the soldiers on the front lines: The bandit atmosphere is rampant, invading our country's territory. The sounds of war have spread, and the whole country is indignant. Fortunately, you have led your troops to launch a major attack, fighting for your lives on the frontier in the snow and ice. The spirit of our great Chinese nation is thus promoted, and the world's view of us is changing. Recently, we read the news of a great victory in the Battle of Bailingmiao. We were overjoyed to hear the good news. This is due to the soldiers' dedication to their duties and also to your effective command. However, we have heard that the bandits' hearts are not dead and they are still plotting to advance north. We hope that you will boost morale again and strike directly at the nest, exhaling and raising eyebrows, now is the time. This association vows to be a firm supporter with all its heart and sincerity. Once the anti-gas masks are collected in full numbers, they will be transported to the front lines and reported to you. We congratulate you in advance. May you take note."</p>

<h3>Domestic Long-Distance Telephone; Business Regulations; Effective December 1st; Implemented Simultaneously Nationwide; Shanghai Telephone Bureau Announces</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations newly formulated by the Ministry of Transportation were promulgated on October 15th of this year and have now been decided to be implemented from the first day of next month. It is reported that the Ministry of Transportation, in view of the annual expansion of long-distance telephone lines in various regions of the country and the gradual opening of long-distance telephone lines in nine provinces, has found that the long-distance telephone business is becoming increasingly complex and that the long-distance telephone business regulations promulgated in June of the twenty-second year are no longer perfect due to the changing times and circumstances. Therefore, new regulations have been formulated. Since receiving the order, the bureau has found that there are many differences between the new and old regulations and is deeply afraid that errors may occur if they are implemented hastily. Therefore, it has ordered long-distance personnel to carefully study the regulations and has printed the new regulations in the October telephone directory supplement, which will be distributed to all users for reference, and many copies have been printed for general public use at any time. There are many differences between the new regulations and the old regulations, and there have been many improvements. The following is a summary of the important changes: (1) Changes in the names of various types of calls: "Ordinary Call" is now changed to "Regular Call", "Urgent Call" is changed to "Urgent Call", "Ordinary Notification" is changed to "Regular Call", "Urgent Notification" is changed to "Urgent Call", "Ordinary Call" is changed to "Regular Call", "Urgent Call" remains "Urgent Call", and "Scheduled Call" is changed to "Scheduled Call". (2) The price of call calls is now the same as the price of calling calls, and the special power fee has been abolished. The scope of the call call was limited to 5 kilometers from the bureau in the old regulations, but the new regulations changed it to 3 kilometers. (3) The waiting time for no-fee cancellation numbers has been shortened to 2 hours for regular calls and 1 hour for urgent calls. (4) Calling calls, calling calls, the points that should be paid attention to according to the regulations from the time the calling bureau connects to a certain number in a certain place, the time must be counted for billing from the time the called user and the caller start talking. If the called user's servant answers the phone and then informs the owner to come to answer the phone, or uses a small exchange to transfer the extension to call in to answer the phone, the time spent in between should be counted together with the conversation time. If it exceeds three minutes, an additional call fee must be paid.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Military Administration Proclamation; The Government's True Intention for Conscription; The Only Important Policy for Enriching National Power and Seeking Strength; No Retreating in Fear or Impersonating</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Administration recently issued a proclamation regarding conscription and posted it in various counties. The original text is recorded below: "To establish a nation today, military force is essential for survival, and the implementation of a conscription system is essential for enriching military force. In modern countries, from Germany and France in the far past to Japan in the near past, all have vigorously implemented a system of all citizens being soldiers. All people aged nineteen or twenty and above must serve in the military for several years. The French constitution even stipulates that people who have not served in the military cannot participate in elections, which shows the importance attached to military service. In ancient China, soldiers and civilians were not separated. In times of emergency, they were conscripted into the army, and in times of peace, they were discharged and became civilians. Therefore, the country did not have the reality of raising soldiers but achieved the effect of having a large number of soldiers. In modern times, conscription was changed to enlistment, and soldiers and civilians were separated. Civilians no longer valued military affairs, and the national consciousness declined as a result. In view of this, our National Government has clearly ordered the promulgation of military service regulations, which will be implemented from March 1st of this year. Various laws and regulations concerning military service have been formulated and promulgated one after another, and six provinces, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, have been demarcated as jurisdictions to pilot conscription affairs. The remaining provinces have implemented national military service as a preparation for conscripting active soldiers, so that all people in the country have the opportunity to receive military training and strengthen their physical fitness in preparation for being selected as national talents. However, for fear that the people may not understand the government's true intention for implementing the conscription system at the beginning of implementation, we reiterate the following: All our citizens must know that the military service system is based on the ancient established laws of our country and is the only important policy for enriching national power and seeking strength. Serving in the military is an obligation that the people should fulfill to the country. All men of conscription age must understand this intention, actively respond to conscription, and not retreat in fear or impersonate, lest they violate the law and be punished. Proclamation."</p>
<h3>Minister Kong; Concerned About the Financial and Industrial Affairs of Guangdong Province; Song Ziwen to Investigate Conveniently; Huang Musong to Consult as Instructed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Guangdong Province was originally a wealthy region, but in recent years, due to poor politics, economic panic, and difficult livelihoods, after the unification this autumn, all policies have been renewed, and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has been particularly strong in reforming the province's finances. However, since the prohibition of gambling and the abolition of harsh taxes, the central government must still subsidize several hundred yuan each month. Only by increasing revenue and reducing expenditure and making comprehensive plans can the goal be fully achieved. It is investigated that the province has original provincial-run industries, such as sugar and cement, paper-making, fertilizer, sulfuric acid, rayon, and other factories. Although some of them have achieved success, there are also those that rely on tax exemptions for maintenance. The provincial treasury has many burdens, and the national treasury also suffers considerable losses. In the future, how should these industries be reorganized separately? They are closely related to finance. If they are not thoroughly studied and fundamental measures are not taken, not only will these industries gradually fail, but also the reorganization of finances will be more difficult. Recently, local authorities have advocated changing them to commercial operations for development. Kong is very concerned and, due to the invitation of local authorities, originally planned to go in person to inspect the actual situation and jointly plan a permanent solution. However, due to busy government affairs and poor health, he was unable to fulfill his wishes. Fortunately, Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Committee, went south to attend the opening of the Guangdong Bank. Kong believed that Song had been in charge of Guangdong's finances for a long time and knew the situation well, and is now the executive director of the Construction Bank Corporation. Kong himself is the chairman of the board. The company's purpose is to assist and support the development of industry. Therefore, he entrusted Song to inspect the entire situation on his behalf and to consult first. He also telegraphed the local authorities to inform them in advance. It is now reported that Chairman Huang has sent a reply to Shanghai, stating that the reorganization and development of Guangdong's provincial-run industries and other construction projects have been transferred to the Finance and Construction Departments and the municipal government for contact with Brother Ziwen.</p>

<p>Eulogy Telegram from Huang and Others: Huang Muhan and committee member Wang Yingyu of the Guangdong Provincial Government recently sent a telegram of eulogy for the late National Government Committee Member Xu Guqing, and dispatched Huang Zhenqiu as a representative to offer condolences. The original text of the eulogy is recorded below. Transferred by the Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association of Avenue Hoche, Shanghai: To the Funeral Committee of Mr. Xu Guqing, please be advised of the elegy, which reads: "On the 13th day of September in the 25th year of the Republic of China, National Government Committee Member Mr. Xu Guqing passed away at the age of seventy-six. Alas! The passing of a seasoned statesman is mourned by all. Huang Muhan, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and committee members Wang Yingyu, Song Ziliang, Liu Weichi, Xu Chongqing, Liu Jiwen, Xiao Jishan, Luo Yiqun, and Li Xuhuan, along with Secretary-General Cen Xuelv, deeply feel the bond of our shared homeland and are filled with increased sorrow. We respectfully offer this eulogy: Born an outstanding talent, endowed with both literary and martial abilities. The restoration of Nanjing shines with his contributions throughout the universe. He did not dwell on his accomplishments, yet his achievements were towering. Who in ancient or modern times can match his stature as both a famous general and a Confucian scholar? With lofty aspirations and far-reaching plans, he formulated strategies for border defense. During times of national hardship, when the flames of war raged in all directions, he was a pillar of the state who suddenly fell from the heavens. The Huangpu River and the Pearl River lament at the wind. Alas!" Due to the difficulties of travel between Shanghai and Guangdong, we are unable to personally attend the ceremony. Therefore, we have specially dispatched Director Huang Zhenqiu to represent us in offering condolences. This telegram is respectfully sent. Huang Muhan.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Rice Industry Association Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday, Resolving to Petition the Executive Yuan to Order All Provinces to Lift Rice Restrictions and Request Jiangsu Province to Order Qingpu and Other Counties to Allow Rice Boats to Pass Freely</h3>
<p>The joint association of rice industry associations of Jiangsu, Nanjing, and Shanghai cities and counties, in order to discuss the case of rice boats bound for Shanghai being detained by Qingpu and Jinshan counties, held its sixth joint meeting of the first session yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at Cuixiu Hall on Fuyou Road. Representatives from rice industry groups from Nanjing, Shanghai, and other cities and counties, including Liu Jiuyu (Xinghua), Cai Baosun (Qingpu), Qian Jingsheng, Li Zhongchen, Lu Zhuqing, Chen Hongyuan, Zhao Zhixin, Zhou Mingtao Yin Fu (Wuxi), Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, Cai Yukun (Shanghai), Lai Ziqi, Shen Qiuru (Zhujiajiao), Yin Zhongren (Jiangyin), Pang Qinsheng (Wujiang), and Wu Tixian (Zhenjiang), totaling nineteen people, were present. Gu Xinyi was elected chairman, and Yao Kejun served as secretary.</p>
<p>Reporting on the Process: After performing the customary rituals, Chairman Gu Xinyi first reported on the purpose of convening the joint meeting of rice industries from various cities and counties. Then, Cai Baosun, the representative from the Qingpu County rice industry, and Lai Ziqi, the representative from Zhujiajiao, described how the local county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to obstruct rice boats from leaving the county, and how they jointly requested the county government to release the boats through the county chamber of commerce, but to no avail. They stated that grain is currently stockpiled inland, greatly affecting farmers and merchants, and requested that representatives from various cities and counties consider the matter as it concerns the same industry, with a relationship as close as lips and teeth, and strive to achieve the goal of lifting the ban. Subsequently, representatives successively expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Various Cases: (1) Representatives from rice industry associations in Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, Xinghua, and other counties proposed that since various counties had received orders from the provincial government to announce a ban on the export of rice, it should be clarified whether rice boats leaving non-coastal counties should all be required to obtain passports, or whether rice circulating inland should be exempt from passports. The following resolutions were made: (A) Petition the Executive Yuan to issue an order to all provinces to lift rice restrictions as soon as possible to benefit the people's food supply. (B) Petition the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order Qingpu, Jinshan, and other counties to release all detained rice boats bound for Shanghai and to order all counties not to detain rice boats bound for Shanghai in the future. (C) Reply to Xinghua County that the Executive Yuan has already issued an order regarding the circulation of grain inland, and there is no need to obtain passports. (2) The Zhenjiang Rice Industry Association proposed to conduct statistics on grain transportation and sales and a food price index table to understand the actual situation of domestic grain and facilitate the country's administrative measures regarding grain. The resolution was: The principle was approved. However, the circumstances in various places are different, and the statistical table should be planned over time to achieve a proper result. First, the proposal should be printed and distributed to industry associations in various places to solicit opinions, and then a decision should be made at the next (December 13) standing committee meeting. (3) Temporary motion: According to the revised constitution, the supervisory committee member should be convened by the chief supervisory committee member with the most votes. Who should be elected as the chief supervisory committee member of this association? The resolution was: Committee Member Cai Yukun was elected to serve as the position. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Detaining Rice for Unloading and Storage: Regarding the case of Qingpu and Jinshan counties detaining rice boats, after negotiations by the local county chamber of commerce and rice industry groups, the county government authorities, on the grounds that they had not received a provincial order for release, temporarily allowed the rice boats to unload and store the rice in local rice shops. Therefore, the detained ships are all engaged in unloading procedures in Sijing, Zhujiajiao, and other places, waiting for a resolution for release.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops in Caojiadu Use Heavy Pecks to Retain Rice, Rice Boats Implement Stop-Pecking</h3>
<p>Dagong News reports that the Shanghai Changshu Guildhall has sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Weights and Measures Inspection Office and the Bean and Rice Industry Association regarding the case of peck operators using heavy pecks to retain rice. This was done in order to eliminate accumulated malpractices and maintain the business of boat merchants. The Bean and Rice Industry Association has since replied that there should be no heavy pecks to retain rice. Currently, rice shops in the Zhabei Xinzhapu area, based on the guildhall's response from the association, have achieved a ban on retention after negotiations. However, recent investigations have found that Hengyigong, Dingtai, Yuanchangshun, Zhang Xiehe, and other rice shops in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, are still instigating peck operators to use heavy pecks to retain rice, resulting in a loss of 1.5 to 1.6 deciliters of rice per peck. Rice boat merchants brave the wind and rain, and the surplus profit from their hard work is almost entirely exploited by merchants and peck operators. After receiving repeated reports from member boat merchants, the Changshu Guildhall sent representatives to negotiate with various shops, but they were all ignored, citing the excuse of not receiving a notice from the industry association. As new rice is now entering the market, the guildhall, in order to protect the interests of boat merchants, has issued a notice to Changbang rice boats in the Caojiadu area to immediately stop pecking. Furthermore, an emergency meeting has been scheduled for 3:00 PM today to discuss sending representatives to petition party and government agencies, requesting strict measures to ban heavy pecks to retain rice in order to alleviate the plight of Suzhou merchants.</p>
<h3>Representative of International Telephone Company, Mr. Forman, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shenzhou News reports that the British International Telephone Company has many related investments in China. The Shanghai International Settlement Telephone Company and the Guangzhou Telephone Company are both related to the company. Mr. Forman, the vice-chairman of the company, has recently been dispatched to China and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Mr. Forman's visit will involve discussions with our authorities in Shanghai regarding the issue of telephone rights beyond the boundary line, representing the company's side. Negotiations on the issue of telephone rights beyond the boundary line have been ongoing for a long time without any concrete resolution. Therefore, Mr. Forman's visit aims to find an appropriate solution to this matter. However, it is heard that our side, based on the principle of sovereignty, still adheres to the principle of complete recovery. Whether a good outcome can be achieved is still uncertain. It is also learned that Mr. Forman will go to Guangdong after completing his business in Shanghai. The Guangzhou Telephone Bureau is also a joint venture established by the Guangdong Municipal Government and the International Telephone Company. In the past, the internal operations of the Guangzhou Telephone Bureau were not well managed, and foreign senior staff received high salaries without bearing actual responsibility, resulting in a lack of good business performance. Since Zeng Yangfu took over as Mayor of Guangzhou, he decided to completely recover the Guangzhou Telephone Bureau and operate it independently. He had previously proposed this to the International Telephone Company. Therefore, the company specially dispatched Mr. Forman as a representative to consult with the Guangzhou authorities on all matters.</p>

<h3>South Africa Implements Harsh Regulations, Devastating the Commerce of Our Overseas Chinese (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Country's Petition Representatives Have Arrived in Shanghai and Will Go to Beijing to Petition Our Authorities</p>
<p>The overthrow of the agreement cannot be agreed upon. The harmful thieves go even further and assume the sacred authority of party governance under the guise of the Party Department, falsely accusing Consul-General He of colluding with communists and reactionary elements, resulting in his dismissal. Since Consul He's departure, overseas Chinese affairs have deteriorated, villains are rampant, and outstanding individuals are adopting a policy of self-preservation, viewing social undertakings as a dangerous path. The oppressive regulations have become increasingly severe. The Tenancy Act, which will be implemented on May 1, 1937, will inevitably lead to the elimination of many overseas Chinese merchants, posing a great threat to their livelihoods. In recent years, various municipal governments, due to the impending implementation of the Tenancy Act and the powers conferred by the Business Management Act, have completely refused to issue new business licenses to overseas Chinese. Unable to do anything, the overseas Chinese have mostly turned to doing business in native areas. After the Federation abandoned the gold standard in 1932, all industries have recovered their past prosperity and made rapid progress. The municipal tax revenues of various cities are very abundant, so they are all keen on municipal construction, implementing</p>
<p>Black and White Segregation: The native areas of various cities are not suitable for hygiene and are exceptionally dirty. Therefore, the municipal governments of 36 cities and towns in the entire region convened a joint meeting in 1934, resolving to build native villages outside various cities in a short period of time, relocating the natives in the city to the native villages to improve the city's hygiene. However, only natives have the right to do business and reside in the so-called native villages, and other races are not allowed to participate. Wealthy cities are actively building these villages on the borders of the city. Other cities will begin construction as soon as finances are resolved. Under the restrictions of the Tenancy Act and the Native Act, overseas Chinese have no opportunity to operate. The only thing they rely on to maintain their livelihood is the locations where natives reside. Overseas Chinese merchants in the native areas of various cities account for half of all overseas Chinese stores. Now, during the municipal construction of various cities, the native customers of the overseas Chinese are being relocated out of the city, and overseas Chinese are not allowed to follow their customers to do business. This is equivalent to expelling customers and not allowing them to seek other occupations, indirectly eliminating half of the overseas Chinese stores. In the Federation's oppression of Asian overseas Chinese, there are explicit harsh regulations on the active side, and municipal and economic oppression on the passive side. Under this heavy oppression, not only do the overseas Chinese have no foothold, but they are also in danger of bankruptcy at any time. The suffering they feel cannot be described by words or pen. The Federation's maltreatment of our overseas Chinese is truly unprecedented. The situation of our overseas Chinese is even worse than that of slaves. The above are just the most obvious examples. Other harsh regulations, such as immigration laws, liquor laws, and other</p>
<p>unfair: Although immigration laws are tools for various countries to restrict immigration, they are also legitimate. However, no one has been as cruel as the Federation's Asian immigration laws. The Federation has separate European and Asian immigration laws. The European immigration laws give preferential treatment to European immigrants in order to absorb Europe's surplus population. The Asian immigration laws are extremely oppressive and cruel, imprinting fingerprints on the residence permits of Indians and overseas Chinese as if they were criminals. Overseas Chinese women over the age of sixteen cannot enter the country. After entering the country, they cannot leave the country for three years. The departure period is also three years, and they cannot re-enter the country after the deadline. The police have the right to inspect residence permits at any time, and those who disobey will be severely punished. As a result, unscrupulous police officers abused their power, and the overseas Chinese endured in silence, unable to resist. The thieves from 32 years ago acted as accomplices, exploiting and extorting in every possible way. The suffering of the overseas Chinese can be seen from this. Next is the liquor law. The provincial liquor law stipulates that people of color are not allowed to drink alcohol. Overseas Chinese are considered</p>
<p>People of Color: According to research, the Federation considers its slave descendants to be people of color, who cannot enjoy all civil rights. The Chinese are also considered people of color, so they do not enjoy civil rights either, which is very infuriating. We, the divine Chinese race with a history of five thousand years, are actually labeled as inferior mixed-race people by this self-important Federation. The overseas Chinese consider this a great national humiliation. Other unequal treatment, such as food, transportation, entertainment, sports, and education, is prohibited unless they associate with people of color. Even public toilets are prohibited. The lives of the overseas Chinese are truly slave-like and inhuman. In summary, the biggest reason for the overseas Chinese's cruel maltreatment is that there are no diplomatic relations between China and the Federation. The humble opinion of the overseas Chinese is that one</p>
<p>Relief Methods: There have always been very few Japanese traveling to the Federation. In addition to receiving slightly better treatment than the overseas Chinese in other aspects, they are subject to the same restrictions on residence, business, and the purchase of real estate as the overseas Chinese. Since the establishment of the Japanese-Philippine Gentlemen's Agreement, Japanese overseas Chinese have not been restricted by the Tenancy Act and have the right to reside and do business freely. Since the Japanese overseas Chinese have been exempted from the Tenancy Act, other harsh regulations have also been lifted accordingly. Therefore, it can be said that the Japanese overseas Chinese in the Federation are now completely free and equal. As for our overseas Chinese, since the failure of the Sino-Philippine Gentlemen's Agreement, their lives have not only had no guarantees, but the harsh regulations have become even more severe, and the suffering is even deeper. The cutoff of their livelihoods is only a matter of time, and the future of overseas Chinese children who are nearing adulthood is even more uncertain. However, since gaining diplomatic independence in 1926, the Federation has been quite active in diplomacy, having established agreements with France, the Netherlands, the United States, Italy, Germany, Portugal, and other countries, and has exchanged envoys with the above countries. The purpose of the Federation's diplomacy is to prepare for its future international status. Having gained diplomatic independence, it should establish diplomatic relations with various countries in order to have the actual effect of diplomatic autonomy. Otherwise, we will forever be an appendage of the British Empire. If our government can sympathize with the plight of the overseas Chinese and not neglect them because of their small numbers, it should first sign a</p>
<p>Reciprocal Trade Agreement: This would implicitly recognize it as an independent and autonomous country. The Federation would not only thank our country for its kindness but would also further recognize our country as a good friend. The overseas Chinese would also receive great favors from the government. The reciprocal trade agreement is the only way to save the overseas Chinese from their dire situation. In the Federation's rapid development of industry and commerce, a trend of overproduction has gradually emerged. The Philippine government is actively seeking overseas markets. The future business relationship between our country and the Federation will be quite important. Therefore, in order to alleviate the suffering of our overseas Chinese and promote Sino-Philippine trade, we sincerely hope that the government can quickly send a well-known diplomatic envoy to the Federation to conduct business talks or agreements with the Federation in order to fundamentally liberate our overseas Chinese. If this goal can be achieved, it would be the greatest hope of our overseas Chinese. Otherwise, it is also necessary to send a diplomatic envoy to negotiate with the Federation on the residence and business issues of the overseas Chinese, and strive to resolve them. At a minimum, it must also ensure that our overseas Chinese have the right to do business and reside freely. The reason why the overseas Chinese earnestly request the government to send another diplomatic envoy to the Federation to handle this negotiation is that the consul's powers are limited and insufficient to handle this major task. This is because the consul is only a commercial officer, not a diplomat. This major diplomatic task cannot be handled by a consular officer. We earnestly present our situation and hope that you will understand.</p>

<h3>Paint Store Apprentice Commits Suicide Out of Despair; Father Listens to Second Wife, Frequently Abuses Son from First Marriage; Xiao Boqin Takes Poison After Receiving Letter from Father</h3>
<p>Xiao Boqin, a 23-year-old apprentice from Yuyao who had completed his apprenticeship at the Jiuhexing Paint Store at No. 371 Minquan Road, next door to the Grain Guild, committed suicide. His father had considerable wealth in his hometown, but Boqin was born at an unlucky time. His birth mother died early, and his father remarried. His stepmother then gave birth to three sons. According to folk customs, stepmothers often treat the children of former wives harshly, and this stepmother was no exception. Xiao endured much suffering. At the same time, his father was like a blind man, listening to his second wife and treating his son from the first marriage as an outsider. Therefore, when he reached adulthood, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to work as an apprentice, enduring the hardships of apprenticeship. It seemed that he was destined to suffer for the rest of his life. Unexpectedly, even after he came of age, he was not given a home. Recently, his father again listened to his second wife and divided the property among his four sons, sending a letter to Shanghai urging Boqin to return home. Upon reading the letter, Boqin realized that the division of property was biased, and he was overwhelmed with feelings of despair. A single family report became a death warrant, and he was determined to end his life. On the night before, he swallowed opium to kill himself. He did not make any noise after taking the poison but lay face up on the floor upstairs, closing his eyes and waiting for death. Because the staff in the store needed to handle the import and export declarations through customs, which was usually handled by Boqin, they assumed he was at customs when they did not see him and did not pay attention. It was not until noon that they discovered Boqin dead on the floor. They were shocked and called for help, but there was nothing they could do. They reported the situation to the Yemiao police, who investigated the matter. The local head, Chen Baoyuan, was ordered to report the case to the District Court. The court dispatched Prosecutor Li to the scene to investigate and determined that the store should provide a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Approves Salary Reduction Plan; Staff's Response</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council previously appointed a special economic committee to consider the issue of staff salary reductions.

The Shanghai Municipal Council Staff Union believes that the report lacks clarity in many aspects and has scheduled a meeting for all staff on Tuesday evening this week at the Municipal Council to invite a financial expert from among the staff to provide explanations. At the same time, because the staff believe that their lives will become difficult after the implementation of the measures outlined in the report, they are now seeking legal advice to see if there is any way to remedy the situation.</p>

<h3>Burglary at the Dongya Restaurant; Stolen Silver Tableware Worth Over 2,000 Gold; Three Suspects Arrested, All Dongya Tea Servers</h3>
<p>A large number of silver tabletops were stolen from the Dongya Restaurant on Nanjing Road recently. The restaurant did not notice it at the time but later received an anonymous letter. After checking, they found that 14 sets of silver tabletops had been stolen, worth more than 2,000 yuan. The restaurant reported the case to the Lao Zha Police Station. Detective Zhang Yuanjing and investigator Wang Yingjie investigated and identified three tea servers, Zhang Changyou from Ningbo, and two accomplices, Xu Zengfu from Changzhou, and Chen Yourong from Guangdong, as major suspects. Except for Zhang, who confessed to the theft, the other two who were initially under investigation were ordered to return. Xu Zengfu was immediately arrested at the Dongya Restaurant. Chen Yourong fled and could not be arrested. Later, it was learned that Chen was hiding at No. 271 Zhejiang Road, so they went there and apprehended him. He confessed that the silverware had been pawned at the Yude Pawnshop at No. 490 Fujian Road, and it was retrieved. The suspects were handed over to the First Special District Court the day before yesterday. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, explained the case and prosecuted them under Article 321, Section 4 of the Criminal Code. Because further investigation was needed, he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Judge Feng Shide questioned each defendant and ordered the hearing to be postponed for one week.</p>
<h3>Bao Gang Case to Resume Hearing Today</h3>
<p>Lawyer Bao Gang was sued by Cui Changgui, the bodyguard of Liu Huaizhi, captain of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Detective Team, for seducing his fiancée, Yang Yuehua, and for being helped by Bao's tea server, Zhang Xinkui, in enticing her. The District Court has indicted Bao and Zhang. Because Bao was suspected of evading after being released on bail, his guarantor withdrew the bail. It was ordered to detain Bao and Zhang. Later, Bao was approved to provide a shop guarantee of 5,000 yuan, but because the shop's financial resources were insufficient, he was not released. Now, Bao has presented counter-evidence, claiming that he was representing a lawsuit at the time of the alleged seduction. Zhang Xinkui has also presented counter-evidence, claiming that he was not in Shanghai at the time he was accused of helping with the seduction because his nephew was getting married in his hometown. In order to be cautious and prevent collusion, the court judge Wang ordered a suspension of visits. The hearing has been moved forward to today, the 20th of this month.</p>

In addition to sending separate letters, we are writing to you specifically to inquire and urge you to consider the difficulties of the times, accept this offer promptly, and send two or more fully authorized representatives with verification letters to attend on time without fail. We eagerly await your response. Sincerely, Guangbang Lianyi Hall. (The letter addressed to the Shanghai Citizens' Boat Porter Union is omitted as the text is the same.)</p>

<h3>Quarrel Over Gambling Leads to Enmity; Two People Wounded with an Axe; Liang Xiaoyu Imprisoned for One and a Half Years</h3>
<p>Liang Xiaoyu, 19 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 71, Lane 49, Yuezhou Road, works as a carpenter. On the evening of the 12th of this month at about 10 PM, he went to the home of his neighbor Zhou Fusheng from Ningbo at No. 49 to play mahjong. He lost 25 copper coins and refused to pay, leading to an argument with Zhou's wife, Li. He returned home in anger. After a while, he retrieved an axe, hid it in his sleeve, and returned to Zhou's house. While talking to Li at the door, he pulled out the axe and struck her on the head, causing her to fall to the ground and call for help. Her husband, Zhou Fusheng, opened the door and was also struck on the head with the axe while trying to stop him. He tried to flee. Detective Ma Bingzhang Zhao Lai arrested Liang and took him and the murder weapon to the Hongkou Police Station. The next morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court.

<h3>Major Fire in Beixinjing Town</h3>
<p>At 11:30 PM the night before last, a small restaurant owned by a local, Zhao Guisheng, at No. 4, Lane 181, in Beixinjing Town, northwest of Shanghai, somehow caught fire.

He also notified the Caojiadu Fire Brigade to rush to the scene to extinguish the flames. However, the area was mostly thatched houses, and there were no fire hydrants, making it difficult to put out the fire quickly. It was not until around 2:00 AM that the fire was extinguished, after consuming twenty-four thatched houses. Yesterday, Yang Guisheng, the suspected arsonist, was handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Japanese Subsidiary Coin Case: Interrogation of Witnesses Concluded, Zhu Xing San Detained Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Li Yunmai, a Nanjing native residing at No. 14, Jumen Road, in the Nanshi district, recently manufactured counterfeit five-sen and two-sen Japanese coins. With the help of Zhu Xingsan (also known as Sheng San), a Shandong native working as a customs broker at No. 478, Rue Albert, in the French Concession, he attempted to sell them to a Japanese merchant named Ite. Ite, who lives at No. 52, Lane 172, Kunshan Road, in the International Settlement, was approached around 10:00 AM on the 20th of this month with thirty of the counterfeit five-sen coins. However, detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, acting on a tip from an informant, secretly went to the address and arrested both Li and Zhu. They also went to the workshop at No. 14, Jumen Road, and seized two small packages of lead scraps, a package of gauze, a small vat of chemicals, and a furnace iron frame. In a moment of desperation, Li pretended to be thirsty, seized the opportunity to drink the chemicals, and succumbed to the poison after being rushed to the hospital for treatment. His body was taken to the forensic examination office on Avenue Foch, where the prosecutor from the First Special District Court determined that the death was caused by poisoning. Zhu Shengsan was sent to the Third Criminal Court for detention and investigation. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that Japanese national Ite and Chinese national Lu Fengxiang were present to testify. Lu Fengxiang, from Shaoxing, testified that he had known the defendant for many years and worked as a broker for Sino-Japanese sales. At the end of last month, on the orders of a detective from the Japanese Consulate, he bought ten counterfeit five-sen coins from Zhu, paying three yuan. Ite testified that he was an exporter and knew the defendant. At the beginning of the month, Zhu came to him to sell the five-sen counterfeit coins, saying that ten coins (equivalent to half a yen) were priced at only two and a half yuan, offering a significant profit. When questioned, Zhu admitted to going to Ite's place to collect commissions on artificial silk transactions and claimed complete ignorance of Li Yunbao's counterfeit coin operation. He hired lawyer Fan Gang for his defense. Judge Zhong ordered Zhu to be remanded in custody, with sentencing scheduled for a later date.</p>

<h3>English Newspaper's Tung Oil Panic Theory: Statement from German Havas Agency</h3>
<p>According to a local news item in the Guomin News Agency on November 25th and 29th, Mr. Fu Yuansi, the Eastern Manager of the German Havas Agency of the Guomin News Agency, who had previously refuted the unfounded rumor of a German-Japanese military alliance, now sees a certain English newspaper in Shanghai again reporting that Germany has established an agreement with China and "Manchukuo" to exchange goods. He makes the following statement:</p>
<p>The report in a certain English newspaper in Shanghai, titled "Tung Oil Panic," states in essence: "The Sino-German exchange of goods agreement has some connection with the planned establishment of a government-protected tung oil monopoly in China. The world market's demand for Chinese tung oil is increasing rapidly. The implementation of a monopoly will severely damage this booming trade. In fact, China already holds a global monopoly on tung oil. However, other countries are already engaged in experimental tung tree cultivation. Once the situation changes, or if Myanmar, South America, or even Soviet Russia emerge as tung oil suppliers, China will be permanently excluded from the market. The United Kingdom purchases 16% of China's total tung oil exports, while the United States accounts for 71%. The goodwill of these two powerful nations towards China will be jeopardized by the tung oil monopoly." The English newspaper also published an article by a special reporter in a prominent space, similar to what some newspapers did recently, warning China to be wary of Germany. The article also discussed the tung oil issue, stating that British and American commercial interests would be seriously harmed by the tung oil monopoly. To stir up interest, the article also vilified Germany, claiming that Germany had an agreement with Japan to exchange military supplies and that Germany had completed its military buildup and intended to provide its stockpiles of old military equipment and gunpowder to Japan in exchange for goods. The author of the article further claimed that Germany had previously supplied military equipment to the Guangdong provincial government, which was a new interest arising from close cooperation between the German and Japanese military departments.</p>
<p>Here is the response to the newspaper's editorial and the article by the so-called special reporter: The two articles are purely motivated by commercial competition, which is evident from the language used. Otherwise, there is no need to associate Germany's purchase of tung oil with unfounded rumors and false accusations against Germany. Regarding tung oil, we must first clarify that the Chinese Minister of Industry has clearly announced that China does not intend to obstruct the free trade of tung oil in any way. The English newspaper's editorial, which includes statistics showing that China's tung oil exports have increased sixfold in one year, contradicts itself by claiming that the tung oil trade of the United Kingdom and the United States will be threatened. This proves that China's tung oil production is increasing with demand and will continue to increase. China is attracting customers for its emerging business, and even if the customers are being lamented and pointed out as Germany by certain parties, China is unwilling to lose them. Even if certain parties spread alarming words, saying that supplying Germany with large quantities of tung oil will lead to adverse consequences, this confusion is futile, as the Nanjing authorities will not allow anyone to interfere in China's internal commercial affairs. What is even more interesting is the statement in the article that other countries are already engaged in tung tree cultivation experiments and that under certain circumstances, Myanmar, South America, and Soviet Russia will emerge as tung oil suppliers, and China will be excluded from the market. We should know that if British Myanmar is already engaged in tung tree cultivation experiments, then its purpose is to supply the tung oil required by the United Kingdom from its own territory as soon as possible. As for the United States, its commercial relations with South American countries are extremely close. Since South America is engaged in tung tree cultivation and the freight costs are lower than those from China, the United States is certain to be optimistic about its success. These points further prove that China urgently needs to find new major customers to prevent losing its new tung oil customers. On the contrary, if China mistakenly believes in recent provocations and refuses Germany as a major customer for tung oil, then China will lose Germany as a customer after the United Kingdom and the United States can supply themselves. Business must rely on competition to progress; why should Chinese business be any different? The article by the English newspaper's special reporter, which claims that Germany is giving old military equipment to Japan, is a complete fabrication. Considering Japan's low wages, Japan can manufacture any new-era military equipment it needs in whatever quantity at a fraction of the cost required by Germany. To say that Japan wants to buy Germany's old military equipment is too naive to be taken seriously. Moreover, does the Treaty of Versailles allow Germany to store old military equipment? As for the rumors made by the English newspaper's special reporter about the military departments of Germany and Japan, I reply that the previous consultations between Guangdong Province and the central government were purely internal affairs. According to the opinions expressed by the reporter, hinting that the people of Guangdong are being used as tools by the so-called secret German-Japanese military to oppose the central authorities, although I am currently residing in China, I dare to protest against this slanderous and false accusation against the patriotic people of Guangdong. I believe that it is necessary to expose this distorted and absurd statement to all readers in China so that it can serve as an example to understand how absurd and dangerous the provocative articles against Germany are. Some businessmen who are related to business have not considered that China can become a new-era country and want to make China isolated to achieve their own selfish goals. In the eyes of certain parties and those related to tung oil, China seems to be merely an object for their competition, and they are thinking of using inappropriate intimidation and slander against their honest friends to keep China within their scope. All the rumors regarding the German-Japanese military alliance are fabricated by these people. Because they see that their commercial competitors and the major customers of this tung oil are becoming stronger and stronger, they spare no effort to slander them with false rumors.</p>
<h3>Man Dies in Jiangyanglou Teahouse after Vomiting Blood, Elderly and No Relatives Found, Second Special Court to Conduct Examination Today</h3>
<p>At the Jiangyanglou Teahouse, located at No. 77, Rue Vial, in the French Concession, around 4:00 PM yesterday, an elderly teahouse customer, nearly sixty years old, with graying temples, and speaking in a Pudong accent, identified as a construction worker, was drinking tea. At 5:00 PM, the old man suddenly vomited fresh blood, like a tidal wave, and collapsed to the ground. Within minutes, he died. Xia Rongchang (36, from Jiangbei), the owner of the teahouse, reported the incident to the Avenue Joffre French Police Station. An investigation revealed the deceased's name to be Yang Quansheng, 59 years old, with no family and residing in a hostel. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Forensic Examination Office for examination. A request has been made to the Second Special District Court to send personnel for examination today.</p>
<h3>Xu Chengdao Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Xu Chengdao, 44 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 17, Taixing Lane, Rue Muling, was out on business around 2:00 PM yesterday when he was struck by a black-plated car of unknown number at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Avenue Foch. He suffered severe head and internal injuries. Patrolman No. 1057 reported the incident, and the Fire Brigade dispatched Ambulance No. 83 to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The body was transferred to the forensic examination office for examination.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Establish a Pig Farming Waste Removal Facility</h3>
<p>Citizens Zhang Kaifu and Yan Jingren, among others, point out that pig farmers in the city are concentrated in various locations, with one to two hundred households in each place, totaling more than two thousand households. Poor management affects public health and harms the health of the people. They proposed management measures and submitted them to the Municipal Health Bureau. They also noted that pig manure is a beneficial fertilizer for farmland, especially in sandy soil. However, in Shanghai, where there is no cultivated land, this useful material has to be discarded into rivers and ditches. Farmers in Wujiang and Chongming counties come to Shanghai to transport it, but they are unable to concentrate the waste, and they can only sigh. A small number of transporters are deterred by the endless extortion of local thugs and refuse to come. As a result, pig manure accumulates, releasing foul odors, breeding insects, and transmitting diseases through mosquitoes and flies. This not only harms hygiene but also affects agricultural affairs and social order. If a pig farming waste removal facility is established, this waste can be collected and transported to farmland in need. This would not only generate more than ten thousand yuan per year but also increase the city's tax revenue by more than a thousand yuan. However, the Health Bureau is reportedly unaware of the facts and has not agreed to the proposal. The proponents of the proposal believe that the proposed measures are urgent and without hidden flaws and have filed an administrative lawsuit to the municipal government requesting access to the records to review and decide on the matter.</p>

<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<h3>Publication of Ye Qianyu's New Cartoon Collection: Mr. Ye Qianyu is an authority in the modern cartoon world. His continuous cartoons "Mr. Wang" and "Little Chen" are well-known to women and children throughout the country as typical characters of a certain class. Over the past six or seven years, Mr. Ye has continuously created over five or six thousand frames of continuous comic strips, which have been printed into several single-volume cartoon collections. Among them, "Mr. Wang's New Collection" is particularly popular. Since Mr. Ye left Shanghai for Beijing this spring, he separated the two main characters, Mr. Wang and Little Chen. Mr. Wang went to the village, and Chen went to the new capital. Upon the invitation of the Nanjing Morning Post supplement, he began publishing "The Unofficial History of Little Chen in Beijing," creating and publishing new installments daily for half a year without interruption. However, the illustrations published in the newspaper were small, and the explanatory lines were not clear enough. Therefore, Mr. Ye has re-edited and enlarged the illustrations, selecting 400 frames to be printed in a large format of twelve open pages, compiled into the first and second collections in one volume, which was released yesterday. The price per volume is four jiao, with a 10% discount for purchasing two volumes. Shanghai Zazhi Company is the general distributor. This collection is full of humor and exposes the ugly behavior of corrupt officials, new and old bureaucrats, vividly on paper, no different from a new record of the officialdom. It is especially amusing because it is entirely written in a continuous cartoon format. Those who have met "Mr. Wang" should buy and read it quickly, and those who have not read "Mr. Wang" should read this brand-new and interesting picture book even more. The November issue of "Era Movie" is published, edited by Xi Yuqun, who also serves as its publisher. "Era Movie" was published today.

<h3>Poor Performance by Jinan's Soccer Team; Loses to Portugal 4-3; Trailing 2-0 in the First Half</h3>
<p>The Jinan team, which is on the rise, played its last first-round match against Portugal in the Jia Group yesterday at Shenyuan. The Portuguese team has suffered repeated defeats since its formation, and the entire team relies only on Kolasha and Endaye to support the overall situation. Predictions beforehand favored Jinan. After the match began, Jinan did its best, but the god of soccer was not on their side, and they missed good opportunities. As a result, they fell behind 2-0 in the first half. In the second half, although Jinan played facing the sun, their morale was very high, and they scored three consecutive goals. However, Kolasha, who played center forward yesterday, had good coordination with Endaye, and Kolasha still scored two goals, leading to a 4-3 defeat. Jinan's performance in yesterday's game was actually better than in previous matches. The fact that they still suffered defeat can be called a misfortune beyond their control. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>Kolins</p>
<p>Victor Reimiti</p>
<p>Loleus Suo Xue Erfu</p>
<p>Endaye Rochaida Kolasha Shi Weiya Lu Boshu</p>
<p>Jinan Team</p>
<p>Ye Peichu</p>
<p>Xu Hongyin Guan Bayang</p>
<p>Yan Lianjin Chen Zhenxiang Zhang Baiyuan</p>
<p>Wang Nanzhen Liu Shizan Shi Yongnan Wu Shufen Chen Mingze</p>
<p>The Enemy's Arrogant Momentum</p>
<p>With a single blast of the trumpet, the battle began. The Portuguese army took the initiative, launching a large-scale offensive. Jinan's defenses were tight, keeping them out. Returning to the offensive, Wang Nanzhen deployed troops on the left flank, and Shi Yongnan coordinated in the center, but to no avail. Kolasha's brute force was great, personally leading the three armies to attack our borders. Suo's long pass was effective, and Kolasha kicked the ball into the goal, scoring a point. Ye Peichu could only sigh helplessly. Only ten minutes into the game, Jinan was dealt a minor setback, and the soldiers were heartbroken. Who knew that misfortune would not come alone? While the Portuguese army was launching a fierce attack, Guan Ziyang was penalized for a handball, resulting in a 13-yard penalty. Kolasha took the kick, and the powerful arrow was shot out, the camp gate was wide open, and rescue was ineffective, losing another city. Jinan suffered great humiliation, and the more land they lost, the more the entire army gave their all, uniting to resist the enemy. They charged to the enemy's camp gate, and Shi Yongnan got a good opportunity and shot fiercely, but the ball went over the goal, and everyone in the audience regretted it. The Portuguese army's momentum grew stronger, and they actually showed off their power in our formation. Shi Weiya turned around and shot from afar, as sharp as a cannonball. Ye Peichu risked his life, holding on with all his might, preventing a major disaster. After a while, the first half ended, and they took a temporary break.</p>
<p>Recovering Lost Ground</p>
<p>After the lemon break, the Portuguese army's momentum did not diminish, and their iron cavalry roamed, sometimes causing commotion in our rear. Kolasha occasionally received the support of Lu Boshu, directly attacking the gate. Ye Peichu, seeing the situation was not good, rushed out to save, but Kolasha remained calm, flicking the ball lightly, and the ball rolled into the net. The generals of Jinan were all dumbfounded. After losing three points, Jinan was not completely hopeless. The forwards proceeded step by step, attacking the enemy's fortress. The enemy was complacent, only thinking of victory. Unexpectedly, Shi Yongnan suddenly emerged, getting through the difficult situation. In the midst of busyness, he stole a moment to kick fiercely, and Kolins was careless and negligent, unable to block the ball, which went straight into the goal. Our army cheered, as if taking an invigorating potion. The Portuguese army's spirit was dampened, and our army was able to move freely. Before long, the enemy's camp was surrounded by us again. Wu Shufen leaped over the dangerous area, and just as he was about to move forward, Reimiti, eager to save the ball, committed a handball, and the referee awarded a 12-yard penalty. Shi Yongnan calmly aimed and shot, hitting the bullseye. Jinan chased to 2-3.</p>
<p>Ultimately Suffered Defeat</p>
<p>Jinan scored repeatedly, becoming more courageous as they fought. Liu Shizan, with the assistance of Wang Nanzhen, charged into the enemy's battle alone, launching a fierce attack. The Portuguese army fell to the ground, but their aim was inaccurate, and they did not score. From then on, for seven or eight minutes, Jinan's offensive was very strong, and the ball hovered in front of the Portuguese goal. Chen Mingze, Wu Shufen, and Shi Yongnan repeatedly had opportunities to shoot, but due to bad luck, inaccurate shots, or being blocked by the goalkeeper. At this time, the Portuguese army, seeing the situation was not good, attacked with all their might with their five forwards. Kolasha showed both intelligence and courage, receiving the ball and riding alone towards our hinterland. Reaching a suitable position, he shot powerfully from afar, and the ball hit the goalpost, bouncing into the net. Shi Yongnan was not willing to give up, imitating Kolasha's method, attacking alone, kicking the ball, which also hit the goalpost, but did not bounce into the net. Everyone shook their heads. Suddenly, Liu Shizan made a comeback, receiving a pass from Wang Nanzhen, and scored, with the ball going straight into the net. With only a few minutes left until the end of the game, Jinan planned to give it their all again to recover the lost ground, but unexpectedly, the final horn sounded, and they had to succumb to a 3-4 defeat.</p>

<p>The Nanjing Central Guoshu Institute is the highest authority in the country for leading Guoshu. Since the director Zhang Zhijiang enthusiastically promoted it, the achievements in the past seven or eight years have been remarkable. The institute has established various training classes to cultivate Guoshu teachers for employment by all sectors of society. Considering that the previous classes inevitably emphasized martial arts, resulting in a neglect of academic subjects, the institute has recently reformed its educational policy, actively focusing on both art and virtue, and both literary and martial arts. From the current semester, it has enrolled 100 new students with a junior high school graduation level, both male and female, to implement a unified literary and martial arts education. It has also hired Wu Yijun to serve as the director of the academic affairs office. Mr. Wu has been serving in the Shanghai YMCA for many years, and has held teaching positions at Nanyang High School of Commerce, Xujiahui High School, and other schools. Since Mr. Wu took charge of the academic affairs of this class, he has been meticulously planning and proceeding step by step. After more than two months of classes, the spirit of the entire class has been boosted, the order is well-maintained, and the two academic subjects have achieved considerable results. It is heard that new students will continue to be recruited next year in order to promote it universally.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Improve Normal Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular on the 28th to the Education Departments and Bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating: Teacher education is the foundation of national education. Now is the time to vigorously implement the policy of universal education. It is necessary to substantially improve various types of normal schools. The "Key Points for Improving Normal Education in Various Provinces and Cities for the 25th Year" are hereby formulated and attached. Please comply with and implement them, and submit detailed reports on the implementation of various items before the end of December for review. In order to understand the implementation of various types of normal schools in various provinces and cities, the implementation of the curriculum standards for various types of normal schools promulgated by the Ministry, and to solicit opinions for improvement, the Ministry orders the relevant departments to instruct all types of normal schools under their jurisdiction to submit school overviews, and to instruct outstanding normal schools of all types to submit reports on the implementation of the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry and opinions for improvement for review and handling. This order is issued.</p>
<p>Key Points for Improving Normal Education in Various Provinces and Cities for the 25th Year</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry has already clearly stipulated the division of normal school districts in Article 10 of the Normal School Regulations and ordered compliance on April 10, 22nd year. However, most provinces have not yet reported the division to the Ministry. It is now stipulated that provinces that have not divided normal school districts shall, within this year, divide normal school districts according to the conditions of their respective provinces and report the names, scope, and standards of each district for review. Those who have already divided districts but believe that the division is not perfect should also correct it within this year. (2) Normal school districts in provinces that have not established provincial normal schools should immediately find ways to establish them as soon as possible. If there are financial difficulties, they may adopt the method of sharing expenses between provinces and counties. Provinces should appropriately limit the establishment of various simplified normal schools and county normal schools and should conduct thorough examinations of the performance of existing simplified normal schools and county normal schools and urge improvement. Those with poor performance and financial difficulties should immediately find ways to merge them. (3) All provinces and cities should quickly complete the assessment of elementary school teachers in the province and city. Unqualified teachers should be replaced or given supplementary training. (4) All provinces and cities should, in accordance with the phased implementation plans for compulsory education in their respective provinces and cities, comprehensively plan the number of teachers needed to be increased annually and the number of teachers that should be regularly supplemented in ordinary elementary schools each year, and draft expansion and reorganization plans for the number of normal schools of various types and the number of grades in the coming years and submit them for approval and implementation. (5) Starting this year, each normal school district should organize teacher training and guidance meetings, with the provincial supervisor and the principal of the provincial normal school serving as chairman and vice chairman. The directors of county education departments and bureaus, the principals of county normal schools, and the principals of county central elementary schools should be members. Detailed discussions should be held on the plans for setting up classes for training and guidance and other related matters for the education department to adopt. The education bureaus or social bureaus of each city should also handle the matter in accordance with the above methods. (6) Each normal school district should appropriately establish local education instructors in the provincial normal school or the provincial elementary school to provide on-site guidance to elementary schools in the district at any time. The county education departments and bureaus may also hire teachers from normal schools and their affiliated elementary schools or provincial elementary schools with excellent teaching performance as temporary specialist supervisors. The education bureaus or social bureaus of each city should also handle the matter in accordance with the above methods. (7) The education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities should strictly order all types of normal schools to cultivate an excellent school spirit, maintain the stability of teachers' services, and fully cultivate the spirit of professional education training. They should fully study the curriculum standards for elementary schools and kindergartens set by the Ministry, the educational background of the school's region, and local teaching materials. (8) The assessment of teachers in various types of normal schools in all provinces and cities should be completed this year and reported for review. Thereafter, teachers employed in various types of normal schools must be qualified by assessment before they can be appointed. Teachers in affiliated elementary schools or provincial elementary schools must be appropriately hired with those who are research-oriented and have achieved results. (9) Starting this year, the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities should designate one or several provincial and municipal normal schools to separately handle the training of teachers in fine arts, labor, music, physical education, and scouting. (10) The education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities should immediately formulate detailed measures for the distribution and service of graduates from normal schools and submit them for approval and review.</p>

It is expected that the number will be increased to 1,300 next year. The bandit disaster in Suiyuan occurred on the 14th.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Tie Wu)</p>
<p>A coward is one who trembles in fear when the enemy approaches; a hero is one who rises up to fight when the enemy comes to oppress. Be careful! It's the same word "fight"!</p>
<p>Spending one's entire life's energy on a lover often ends in the tragedy of unrequited love. If this energy were transferred to patriotic work, the country would never disappoint you.</p>
<p>"Heroes are short of breath, and children are long of affection." I hope that at the beginning of this national war of resistance, more true heroes will emerge who are not infatuated with the affections of children.</p>
<p>After removing the worldly nets from the eyes and restoring the innocence of vision, one discovers that everything between people is hypocrisy and deceit.</p>
<p>A youth in a harsh environment who can remain clean and not be swayed by customs is indeed a "hero of the times."</p>
<h3>Planting Without Soil</h3>
<p>— Pei Ming</p>
<p>There is a saying in our country: "All things are born from the soil." This saying has been true for thousands of years, but recently it has been broken.</p>
<p>Two Englishmen, A. Hastings-Thcmas and V. C. Deshwood, after four and a half years of research, have invented a method of planting livestock feed without soil. This invention may revolutionize the planting methods that have existed since ancient times. Within half a month of the announcement of this invention, there will be twenty institutions established throughout the United Kingdom, all managed by agricultural experts from rural public associations, whose sole mission is to explain the simplicity of this new planting method to farmers.</p>
<p>The two inventors said that under their new method, the yield of one acre of land can be equivalent to the yield of 1,760 acres of ordinary grassland; seeds worth sixpence can produce 240,000 pounds of feed; a day's harvest can抵 the entire year's harvest of the same size on ordinary grassland; if a farmer uses grains produced by this new method to feed livestock instead of hay or green grass, then, in terms of feed consumption, a pig can save about 11 or 12 yuan from rearing to selling, a cow can save about 18 to 20 yuan, and milk can increase by 15 to 20 percent compared to feeding hay and other feeds; and no matter what kind of livestock is fed with grains planted by this new method, their bodies can be stronger because they are eating tender and fresh things, not the dry and old feed that lacks vitamins.</p>
<p>Recently, the procedures for this new planting method were announced and explained in London. The two inventors call this new planting method the "Small Room Planting Method." Inside the room are rows of trays, and in those trays, seeds are placed today, and tomorrow there will be white thatch growing out, and then they grow larger and larger every day, and by the tenth day, all the feed will have grown fully, waiting only to be taken out to feed the livestock. There is no soil in it; a flat box filled with water is installed on top of the small room, and the water contains a small amount of chemical solution, the elements of which are also the elements of soil, and its price is also very cheap, an ordinary farmer can spend a dozen yuan a month to purchase this solution, which is enough for a month's use.</p>
<p>There are countless small holes at the bottom of the water storage box, and the faucet is opened every three minutes, and the water in the box falls and sprinkles on the trays; on the tenth day, the plants in the trays can be taken out, which is no different from those grown on the grassland, except that these feeds are not stained with some soil or dirt from beginning to end.</p>
<p>After feeding livestock with this rapidly grown feed, these livestock can also be raised in gardens or barns, and after eating this easily digestible tender grass, they do not need to be fed other things such as pastries. If a farmer wants to adopt this new planting method, then he must free up a piece of open space to store other things, because this planting method is obviously not limited to planting livestock feed, and other things such as vegetables can of course be produced just as quickly.</p>
<h3>Child's Talk</h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>"Fathers and brothers are the supervisors of their children," everyone says. But, that's not right! Children are the supervisors of their fathers and brothers! As you get older, you gradually separate from the supervision of your fathers and brothers and advance to the position of being fathers and brothers yourselves; at this time, you also want to guide your children into the right path. Fearing that you yourselves might be careless and perhaps have some indiscreet behavior that your children might learn from, you have to be careful of your daily words and actions, even between a frown and a smile or other small movements, so that they can be used as a model. In this way, are the children not even more so doing the job of supervising their fathers and brothers? Therefore, if there are children in the family, you are more likely to be a perfect person under spiritual supervision. Having good children in the family who can be polished forces you to be happy to do good automatically. This happiness is even better than having virtuous fathers and brothers!</p>
<p>Having children in the family, your love for your spouse will not wane, your respect for your elders will be unquestionable, your prospects for life will be renewed, and everything will have meaning. Children are truly the living treasures of the family! Furthermore, rather than raising a playful dog, why not raise a child with a greater future?</p>
<p>Why do you dislike, or sometimes, or especially dislike, someone else's child? Do you have this situation? If so, please report your reasons.</p>
<p>Don't you always think that your child is more lovable and more lovable than other people's children? You will certainly deny that it is spoiling. However, "a bald-headed son is his own good," is also human nature. In fact, you have more contact with your own children, and human sympathy and natural love are intertwined, which is not surprising. If this understanding is not enough to evoke a knowing smile from you, then please announce the words that you can be satisfied with; in any case, it is thought that people who have children will never laugh at you.</p>
<h3>Black Walls</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>In our place, the walls of houses used to be decorated with lime, so there was no place that was not snow-white; you! If you look at it from afar, in the sunlight or when the weather is cloudy, it may not be very clear, because the white color can make people colorblind and dizzy; now, it is said that this white wall is no longer good, why? In the serious time of national crisis, one cannot but guard against the enemy's planes coming. If the iron birds in the sky, with the creaking sound of the engine, pass overhead, and the bombs are thrown down like rain, then: wouldn't it immediately turn into scorched earth? Because the way to avoid it is to come up with a way. The first step is that if residents want to protect their homes from being targeted by the enemy, all the walls must change the white color to a black color.</p>
<p>Therefore, in recent days, whether it is on the streets or alleys, they have all become black walls, and the plasterers are very busy and especially busy, almost unable to cope. In particular, a kind of black raw material, called "Qinghui" and "Cowhide Glue," have also been sold out because of this. The boss in the lime shop really did not expect that in the sluggish market, he would have this three-fold profit-making business; so he raised the price, and the door market was still in greater demand than supply, and there was a shortage of goods in front of him, and he would not be able to buy it if he was slow. This is also a strange phenomenon that has never happened before; and there are several newly built Western-style houses, and naturally the walls are a bit yellow, and the roofs are a bit red because they are made of machine-made tile tubes. Neck! Unexpectedly, seeing everyone brushing the white walls black, they quickly changed color, some people said: it is called "Blackening," this sentence, heard suddenly, is not good to say that he is not in a humorous tone.</p>
<p>But some people also say: the white wall has become black, but it is to shield the enemy's eyes, which is originally a way of thinking. When it really bombs, it is necessary to know that the people driving the plane will probably not be confused when they look at the lower level of the ground. With a sudden sound, sparks will fly everywhere, and no one can be lucky? The best thing is that since the people in the place have the responsibility to be a common man, the only way is to release a fiery heart and jointly think of weapons to resist insults and make their own defenses. One is to refuse the enemy from invading, and the other is to protect their lives and property. To take it a step further, even if the walls are black, the effect is always minimal. A person's heart is more than ten thousand times stronger than copper walls and iron walls!</p>
<h3>Early Winter in the City</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The sunshine shines on people's bodies, and it doesn't feel scary, but rather warm and lovely. Occasionally, a gust of wind blows by inadvertently, which will make my thin body suddenly shiver slightly! Ah - there is no doubt that it has changed from late autumn to early winter.</p>
<p>Although the modern girls in the city still put on silk stockings and cut-out leather shoes on their jade legs and feet, as if they are still making a final victory with Aunt Feng, their delicate bodies have disappeared their courage, because they have already put on beautiful velvet shirts and new-style coats.</p>
<p>Several shops suitable for winter consumption have prepared all kinds of goods in the large glass window, sincerely welcoming people from all walks of life to patronize. They will soon hang up the banners of winter sales and big competition sales, hoping to do more business in the measuring season. When the year-end is settled, even if they can't make money, they hope not to lose money. However, can every shop achieve this minimum expectation?</p>
<p>Since the hairy crabs from Yangcheng Lake have been rampant in the market, the wife has repeatedly tasted and been tired of them. Changing the taste, they also promote the Tianjin Liangxiang - fruits - under the flashing lights, they are frying and packaging them, and also open the radio, attracting many passers-by to watch, listen quietly to the bullet words and songs, how leisurely, and buy a few packs to take back by the way.</p>
<p>The cruel god of winter has descended on the world. It never shows a little pity for the poor. The desolate west wind will gradually intensify, and the cold power is gradually approaching them! However, those who are rich only need to prepare tonics and cold-proof items early to enjoy themselves, and the god of winter has no way to exert its authority!</p>
<h3>Changing Nests of Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Sharing Vows with a Cup of Water, Talking About Melancholy Under the Blue Lamp; Embroidered Rings Convey Yearning with Red Beans</p>
<p>As Youmei said this, she handed the envelope containing the gold ring to Guoqi. Guoqi, upon hearing her words, although he already knew the intention of her visit, was still taken aback by her suddenness. Therefore, for a moment, he could not reply with a single word. He accepted the envelope, but stared blankly at her. Youmei did not elaborate further, but nodded to him and said, "I'm leaving." With that, she quickly walked away. Guoqi hurried to the doorway to see her off, and she turned her head from afar, nodding repeatedly and smiling, "She will write to you, there's no need for me to say more." Guoqi found this a bit strange, how could a third party emerge between a man and a woman? He quickly returned to the room, opened the envelope, and when he took out the gold ring, he felt like a farmer who had unearthed a gold brick. Although it was a joyous occasion, it was too sudden, and he doubted that he was dreaming, so he couldn't help but be dazed. He held the envelope in his left hand and the gold ring in his right palm, just staring at it. Suddenly, he raised his head and saw in the mirror on the wall a guest wearing a summer cloth long gown standing behind him. Only then did he realize that a guest had entered. He immediately turned around to greet him at the doorway. But when he reached the doorway, he didn't see anyone. He suddenly woke up and realized that he was covered in sweat. Oh, it turned out that the person in the mirror was his own reflection. The guest had already left, and he hadn't even taken off his long gown. He started laughing, put the gold ring on the table, and turned around to take off his clothes. But just as he turned around, while unbuttoning his shirt, he suddenly realized that his hands were unbuttoning, but the gold ring was no longer in his hand. Wearing the long gown, he looked around on the floor, but couldn't find it. Could it have fallen into the cracks in the floor? He frowned, thinking only of this possibility. Lost in thought, he slowly turned towards the window, and then he saw a golden ring lying next to the Western-style envelope on the table. He couldn't help but admit that he was forgetful and burst into laughter. The laughter caused his mother in the opposite room to cough three times. If his mother found out about this, it wouldn't be appropriate. Only then did he calm himself down, take off the long gown, pick up the gold ring, and examine it carefully. When he tried to put it on his finger, it only fit his little finger. People who wear rings don't wear them on their little fingers, so this person's hand must be very small. Looking at the inside of the ring, there were two letters, MN, which were the initials of Menglan. (103)</p>
<h3>First Day of the Suzhou Aesthetic Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Written by Wu Baozhi</p>
<p>During this recent invasion of Suidong by bandits and puppets, the soldiers defending the territory fought bravely, and all patriotic compatriots, without exception, shared the enemy's hatred and called for resistance. Hearing the news of victory, that Bailing Temple had been recaptured, everyone rejoiced even more. Donations from various places were sent to Sui to慰勞 these loyal and brave soldiers who shed blood in the snowy land. The newspapers have載 not载載載載載載載載载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载載载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载载</p>
<p>The Suzhou Aesthetic Exhibition Association, composed of over fifty initiators, including literary and artistic figures, calligraphers, painters, and famous collectors from my Su city, organized an unprecedented aesthetic exhibition. They have been preparing and arranging for days, putting in a lot of effort, intending to use all the income from the tickets to慰勞 the Sui army. Therefore, many珍异 antiques, famous calligraphy and paintings,骨董, flowers, and goldfish gathered in the exhibition have always been hidden away and rarely seen by outsiders. This time, they are all put on public display, which is truly perfect and can indeed broaden people's horizons. The original intention of the organizers was to use aesthetic interests to arouse the public's emotions against the enemy, so they did not hesitate to work hard. The reporter wanted to visit it, so he went to visit on the first day of the meeting and recorded some of the highlights of the content that he saw and heard, as follows.</p>
<p>The venue is the Lequn Society in Jia Gong Lane. I spent four dimes to buy a ticket and went in. Someone was in charge of lottery drawing. I also drew a卷 and received a gift. I actually got a portion of Guanshengyuan's candies. It is said that major manufacturers in Suzhou and Shanghai donated many things this time, so every ticket had a gift. The first room is titled "傲霜," filled with chrysanthemums, and the colors are well-matched, making it very beautiful to look at. The weather has been very cold these days, and most of the rapeseed flowers have withered, but they have been well-protected. It is said that this is the product of Dongwu University and the park. The second room is titled "Bailing Temple," displaying many magnetic copper antiques, as well as several famous paintings. Several antique shops are participating in the exhibition here, all taking out their精品. There are many people賞玩 inside. There is a scroll of "文会图" by Zhou Wenju of the Song Dynasty, as well as "鱼水图" by Chen Suoweng. The landscapes of Shi Tao, a monk of the Qing Dynasty, are all authentic works. The ritual vessels of the Three Dynasties are also very precious. The third room is titled "虎丘," displayed by Zhang Shanzi, Daqian Kunzhong, Tao Zaimin, and a family surnamed Sun from Sichuan. On the east side of this room, there is a live tiger on the stage, its eyes shining and full of energy, which is truly rare. It is said that Mr. Zhang used it as a sketch when he painted tigers, so it is even more vivid. In the middle, there are several tables full of famous goldfish, which are also very珍贵. The fourth room is titled "石壑." There are dozens of stones arched on a table, framed with delicate mahogany frames, with different shapes, exquisite and透贴, which are not easy to collect. On the wall hangs a Buddha statue by Zhao Ziang of the Yuan Dynasty, landscapes by Tang Bohu of the Ming Dynasty, "听松图" by Shen Shitian, landscapes by Huang Ding of the Qing Dynasty, landscapes by Lan Youshu, landscapes by Qian Weicheng, and a ten-foot-long "十马图" co-created by the Zhang brothers, all of which are authentic works, collected by Suzhou collectors Pan Boshan, Peng Gongfu, and Xu Weishi. The fifth room is titled "觉庐," displayed by Xu Juebo, with many jade artifacts of various colors, which are also worth a lot of money. The sixth room is at the end of the venue, which is also the essence of the essence. This room is produced by Chen Jian'an, Zhu Xiyuan, and Zhou Shoujuan. Chen occupies two tables, displaying bottle stones and other items. A self-painted松石海满 hangs on the wall, with strong brushwork and very fine craftsmanship. Zhu's pseudonym is 　盦, and a long table is placed by the east window. The one in the middle, which is tall and arched, is a 周末 ancient device. After many experts have verified it, its name is 　器, also known as Jiazi Yangbaishi. Zhang Danweng also praised it greatly and wrote a long跋 on the cover. There are also bamboo root carvings of Xiaogushan, pine fossils, and three pieces of Ming Dynasty carvings of jasper. The Zun of Ge Kiln is a珍贵 antique. The white deer cave carved in magnetic ware is hand-carved by Tao Tao, a famous modern engraver from Jingdezhen, Jiangxi. The fine craftsmanship is truly beyond the reach of clumsy writing. Zhou's Ziluolan 盦 occupies four tables alone, each with a title, one is "珠瓜珠鱼的珍珠颗颗," one is 　子植物的 "朱实离离," one is chrysanthemums and violets, one is "花如解语还多事一," one is a goddess stone statue, "石不能言最可人." The four tables are exquisitely decorated, with ingenious ideas, and the exquisite structure is hard to match. The seventh room is titled "平地泉," which is contracted by Qian's Food Company to provide refreshments. In addition, there are many gifts donated by various circles, which are also stored in a separate room for people to view. There are so many items that I have to forgive me for not being able to write them out one by one. It is said that these seasonal room names were题署 by the famous Mr. Ye Yuhu the day before, which makes them even more precious and gratifying, adding锦上添花.</p>
<p>After the reporter had a good look, he was so crowded that he was sweating, and he could only write down what he could remember. Among them, there are so many dazzling things that it is really indescribable, making people feel as if they are in the scene, and their minds are 快之. The conference was originally scheduled to be held for four days from the 28th. Because there are many people from Shanghai and other places visiting these days, I am afraid that the meeting will be closed on time, and those who arrive late will have to work in vain, so it will be extended for another day. (There is still one on Wednesday this week.) If Shanghai elegant scholars want to broaden their horizons, it is not too late at this time.</p>
<h3>Three Days Diary of Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Liren</p>
<p>On the sixteenth of this month, Yu and my friend Mr. Xue took the express train to Hangzhou. When we arrived at the Sheng station, it was already twelve o'clock in the evening. The car arrived at the station safely, and I hired a car to the residence of 至戚 in Longxing Road. After that, I had lunch with a rich variety of dishes. Unfortunately, I was tired from the journey and had no appetite. My friend Mr. Xue was physically strong and energetic, and he did not feel tired at all. He ate with relish, and I could only sigh and watch him. My 至戚 Mr. Ji dined with me and others at the same table, and he was very surprised that I did not touch my chopsticks at all. He asked me in a strange voice, "Why don't you eat? Are you afraid that the dishes prepared by Yu "至戚自称" are not to your liking?" I felt very uneasy when I heard this. I said, "That's not the reason. It's just that I have to manage everything myself, no matter how big or small, and I have been suffering from insomnia for several weeks. My memory is also declining, and I can forget things soon after I encounter them. It is difficult to describe such pain. That's why I came to Hangzhou with my companion Mr. Xue, intending to stay in Hangzhou for a few days. The air in Hangzhou is fresh, and the natural scenery is vividly painted. I want to relax my chest, change the air, and cultivate my brain nerves and all the weaknesses of my sexual nerves so that they can return to their original state." My relative Mr. Ji said to me, "Your disease is not difficult to treat. During the spring of last year, when all things were flourishing and youth reappeared, I suffered from amnesia, nocturnal emission, weakness in my limbs, and severe sexual dysfunction. I, "计君自称," grew up in Hangzhou, and the air and scenery are better than anywhere else. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve results by prolonging medical treatment. Fortunately, I received a letter from a famous doctor in Shanghai, saying that I could take a box of "安尔神," a major agent that specializes in treating brain and nerve weakness, as a trial. Later, I wrote to the Renshou Pharmacy in the Old Dexing Lane No. 1, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, Shanghai, and bought a box for trial. Unexpectedly, after taking it, I felt happy and the symptoms were reduced by half. Afterwards, I bought several more boxes, and the disease has disappeared. He advised me to also buy "安尔神," and this serious illness can be guaranteed to be cured after one dose. I followed his advice and bought and took two bottles from Renshou Pharmacy. Then, my stubborn illness and the pain of Yingming have now been removed and restored to health. This is all thanks to my relative Ji, so I especially record it.</p>

<h3>The Problem of People for Industrial Development</h3>
<p>— Duan Sheng</p>
<p>When talking about China's economic construction, one must think of industrial development. Once we talk about industrial development, we must ask how to create it and where the industry is? Industry, dare to say that China will not be very poor. Creation cannot be achieved by empty talk; at least, it must have two conditions: talent and capital. China has been called for industrial development for nearly sixty years, but it has not achieved much success, precisely because these two conditions are insufficient.</p>
<p>The lack of capital is not too worrying. With industry, you don't have to worry about people not investing. As a last resort, if you ignore all interests, you can borrow foreign capital as much as possible to develop. But the lack of talent is really worrying. Some people think that "money makes the world go round," and with money, there's nothing to worry about. In fact, doing things is not that easy. If you start a business under such unhealthy prerequisites, the result will not only be that the business is small, but even the money will be wasted.</p>
<p>The lack of funds in China, if observed from all sides, is undoubtedly undeniable. But if everyone empties their pockets, with the vastness of the territory and the population, I am afraid it will not be a small number. People in the inland countryside who have some financial resources have the following options for their cash:</p>
<p>(1) Buying land and real estate, but as a result of years of economic depression, there are many vacant houses, and it is not easy to collect rent for land. The most unfortunate result is that they may have to pay land taxes.</p>
<p>(2) Lending out for interest is certainly good, but once it is lent out, it is often difficult to recover. Moreover, debt lawsuits do not have a head start. In order to seek high interest, even the principal cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, it is either deposited in banks in the city or hidden at home. However, urban banks may be inconvenient, or there may be concerns. At present, it is probably more common to hoard it.</p>
<p>As for the people with financial resources in the city, they are naturally more concentrated than in the countryside. But their options are limited to the following three items: (1) real estate, (2) industry and commerce, and (3) deposits and securities. Although there are no reliable statistics for the investment figures of these three items. In the early years, there was certainly a lot of investment in real estate. Investment in industry and commerce should be the majority, but in the current environment, it is fortunate to be able to maintain the status quo at most, and it may even be in a state of contraction. Then, under such circumstances, the destination of funds is naturally concentrated in bank deposits and securities trading.</p>
<p>Therefore, to talk about industrial development, at the very least, funds must be used in industry and commerce to have hope. But how can we concentrate funds in industry, commerce, or other industries for industrial development? I believe that the most basic conditions are three points, and other things will not be discussed in detail this month.</p>
<p>The high-sounding construction talks at present are sometimes too abstract in theory and lack concrete conditions. Therefore, although it is said to develop industry and commerce, the non-development of industry and commerce remains the same. Although industrial development requires economic conditions, it also requires political conditions. What I call the most basic conditions is simply to talk about the condition of people. And economic politics are also included in it.</p>
<p>(1) Unsound organization. Isn't this a cliche? In fact, the unsoundness of the organization is precisely because there are no organized talents. Companies and businesses are the way to develop large enterprises, and China has been practicing it for nearly fifty years, but it has not achieved great success. It is not that the company system is not good, but that the management talents are not all suitable. According to the provisions of the Company Law and the General Rules for Merchants, the board of directors is the highest-level officer of the company, and exercises its functions based on the company's articles of association and the resolutions of the shareholders' meeting. Fearing that the directors may be negligent, another supervisor is appointed to investigate the company's financial situation and check the books and documents at any time, and request the directors to report the company's business situation. The legislation is not 周周. The manager is in charge of the affairs of the business site. Although he is supervised and guided by the directors (industrial and commercial owners), his powers are not unclear. However, the board of directors of many companies is like a tiger's head, and the supervisors stand by with their hands in their sleeves. Therefore, the rise and fall of a company is tied to one person, the manager. If the manager is fair and capable, it will not be a complete failure; otherwise, it will be a mess, or the business will become the manager's personal property. Of course, the directors and supervisors must bear their responsibilities, and the directors and supervisors must be people who hold more shares, and should not be so hasty. This is because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The directors and supervisors are produced from the shareholders, so those who have financial resources may not necessarily have talent. Once elected, there is really no way to exercise their 　權. In particular, the inability to read all the numbers and the inability to understand the content of asset liability is also a decisive factor.</p>
<p>(2) The current popular method of selecting supervisors is to adopt prestige and status doctrine. Therefore, those with greater prestige and status in society almost all have the position of director in major companies. May I ask if these directors, even if they are shrewd, capable, and have extraordinary talents, and have the energy of a dragon and a tiger, I am afraid they do not have the time to advise the companies they direct.</p>
<p>(3) During the meeting, they only rely on the manager's report, because they are vaguely unaware of the company's business situation. If the manager says yes, then it is yes; if the manager says no, then it is also no. They have almost become the manager's puppet, resulting in the ridicule of "　董事不懂事." Once the company fails, they cannot escape criminal responsibility. It is also known that the title of director cannot be abused. With the company's highest authority being 　unsound, it is no wonder that the company's business cannot make long-term progress.</p>
<p>(2) Talents are not utilized. Those who have financial resources may not necessarily have talent, and those who have talent may not necessarily have financial resources. This is a common occurrence. And the current company leaders, because of their different vision, insights, and intentions, do not employ talented people, and even those with heavy private intentions are jealous of the virtuous and able, and those with deep prejudices do not know how to improve. Most of China's company businesses cannot keep up with the trends of the times and like to compare them with the old situation, regarding them as golden rules, and the business will never have a scientific day. Even seeking its井幷有條 and clear organization is not much to be seen. The failure of the business is inevitable.</p>
<p>Labor-capital discord. Generally, those with financial resources dare not invest in industrial and commercial businesses, and labor unrest is also one of their concerns. They believe that once the business develops, they are deeply concerned that labor unrest will follow and it will be difficult to deal with. In fact, in the past, it was not right to regard laborers as servants; recently, it is also excessive to regard them as sacred. We believe that if China wants to revive its economy, it must develop industry and create wealth, and to develop industry and create wealth, it must first coordinate labor and capital. Without industry, there is no labor and capital; without labor and capital, there is no industry. Labor and capital are in the same position and should help each other like arms and fingers. However, there is mutual齮齕, or relying on the crowd to 퇴强, disobeying discipline, and not obeying management, which cannot be said to be completely absent. The strength of work efficiency is directly proportional to the moral spirit of service. If you observe discipline and do your duty, the results of your work will be good. Recently, workers have been lacking in these areas, and they have been criticized for it, believing that wages have increased, but work has regressed. Regardless of whether the facts are true or not, in the era of striving to revitalize industry, the quality of labor discipline is closely related to the future of industry. It is absolutely impossible to 曲曲 forgive the duties and disciplines that employees should fulfill because of the large number of employees. Since it is in the private capital system, we must pay attention to the profits of investors, and we must also pay attention to the rewards earned by the hard work of laborers. Therefore, in the future, we should pay close attention to the promotion of discipline, and there should be fair and精审 methods for the distribution of production profits.</p>
<p>Although the above three cannot do everything to promote industrial development, if they can uphold this to seek realization, then investing in industry will not be as hesitant as it is now.</p>
<h3>The Essence and Criticism of Keynes' Monetary Theory</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaofu</p>
<p>(I) The Essence of Keynes' Monetary Theory</p>
<p>The advocacy of currency management theory by the British economist J.M. Keynes has had a significant impact. However, there have been few concise introductions or rigorous critiques of it in our country. The purpose of this article is to briefly introduce the main ideas of Keynes's book, "A Treatise on Money," and offer a small critique.</p>
<p>The central idea of Keynes's monetary theory is that price disturbances arise from the disruption of the equilibrium between savings and investment. Therefore, to stabilize prices (of course, Keynes means to stabilize prices at a relatively high level), this equilibrium must be restored and maintained. Keynes saw that the stability of prices depends solely on the equality between domestic reserves and investment amounts; the stability of the purchasing power of money depends solely on the equality between savings and the adjusted investment cost. Keynes sought to restore the balance between prices and production costs. He said that to achieve this, a currency management policy must be used.</p>
<p>Managed Money, in Keynes's eyes, is the most suitable monetary system for the times. He believed that if you want to stabilize the purchasing power of money, you need production costs to remain unchanged, and you need the production cost of capital goods (i.e., means of production) to be equal to the amount of savings. But how can they be made equal? Mainly only through the use of bank interest rate policies and open market policies. (Keynes also suggested a policy of changing the reserve ratio of ordinary bank deposits at any time.) He said that the level of bank interest rates can affect the price of capital goods because the level of interest rates is inversely proportional to the degree of capitalization of monetary assets. If the income from capitalization is not as large as the benefits given by interest, then monetary capitalists will sell securities and turn to savings. Conversely, if the income from capitalization is greater than the benefits given by interest, then savings deposits will be converted into securities investments. This is the close relationship between investment and savings. Therefore, Keynes believes that the use of bank interest rate policies can regulate investment and savings and restore the equilibrium between the two. Because the level of interest rates affects the price of capital goods, and the increase or decrease in the production of capital goods affects the price of consumer goods.</p>
<p>Keynes saw that if savings exceed investment, entrepreneurs will suffer losses, and the economy will decline. So, in Keynes's view, the moderate expansion and contraction of credit has a very close relationship with economic prosperity.</p>
<p>Because currency management directly opposes the gold standard, Keynes opposed the gold standard. He believed that under the international gold standard, the use of bank interest rate policies can only maintain external balance; not only can it not maintain internal balance at the same time, but it must also sacrifice internal balance to achieve external balance. Therefore, in order to maintain its own interests, it is necessary to abandon the gold standard and adopt a currency management system.</p>
<p>Regarding prices, Keynes seems to be standing in the middle of the quantity theory of money and the theory of overproduction on the surface. But at the same time, he also believed that banks can manipulate the amount of currency, control the amount of investment and savings, and thus banks can influence and even control the price level, revitalize industry and commerce, and bring about prosperity.</p>
<p>The above is the central idea of Keynes's monetary theory.</p>
<p>(II) Criticism of Keynes's Monetary Theory</p>
<p>Now let us make a small critique of Keynes's monetary theory.</p>
<p>First, let's critique it from a theoretical perspective.</p>
<p>Of course, because Britain has favorable conditions in financial organization and other aspects, the central bank uses interest rate policies to implement economic and currency control (currency management is one of the largest facilities for economic control, and its impact is great, and it also has certain effects. Through the use of the currency management system, Britain's banking and credit system has become more stable, and the gold pound has gradually returned to stability. This is what the currency management system helped to achieve. However, we cannot observe complex and subtle economic problems with a narrow-minded perspective.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the greatest purpose of the currency management theory advocated by Keynes is to stabilize prices at a relatively high level (in fact, the higher the price, the better for factory owners, and the so-called higher level is probably not easy to fix its degree in Keynes's eyes). This is originally the central problem under profit production. All kinds of rationalization movements, etc., are for this point. However, to think that price disturbances and declines are caused by the loss of equilibrium between investment and savings is not in line with the facts. Because we can ask such a question; why do investment and savings lose equilibrium? If it is said that the loss of equilibrium between savings and investment is due to price disturbances, then! We have fallen into the quagmire of circular reasoning, and we really don't know whether the chicken came before the egg or the egg came before the chicken.</p>
<p>We know that the problem of price disturbances is innate, and it is bound to erupt when the time comes. This kind of eruption roughly takes on a cyclical shape, and one is more severe than the other (this is the case in the general trend). The decline in value and price has its natural tendency; this is because the organic composition of capital is increasing day by day, technology is progressing day by day, production is becoming more and more socialized, and ownership is becoming more and more oligopolistic—in short, this is the result of the increasing imbalance between production and consumption under blind production. Therefore, the problem of price disturbances and declines is actually a problem of imbalance between production and consumption, not a problem of imbalance between savings and investment.</p>
<p>Not only are price disturbances and declines due to the imbalance between production and consumption, but also the imbalance between savings and investment is due to this. The disturbance of prices and the destruction of the equilibrium of savings and investment can be said to be a companion phenomenon. The two are mutually promoting and mutually influencing; but in origin, the former is the cause of the latter, and not the latter is the cause of the former; because when capital cannot find profits or satisfactory profits, it will inevitably turn to savings for profit. Keynes instead regards the imbalance between savings and investment as the cause of price disturbances, which is another point of reversing cause and effect.</p>
<p>Moreover, under blind production, price disturbances and the imbalance between savings and investment are a necessary way for prices to return to stability (temporary) and savings and investment to return to equilibrium (temporary). However, as shown above, disturbances and the destruction of equilibrium are, in general, one more severe than the other. The economic panic that started in 1929 was the most dangerous manifestation ever seen in the history of capitalism. In the face of such price disturbances and the destruction of the equilibrium of savings and investment, all monetary policies can only be used to extract more from the domestic masses and colonial people, and to help the munitions industry and public works, etc., to create an abnormal prosperity, delaying and deepening the crisis.</p>
<p>Regarding the quantity theory of money, although Keynes expressed little confidence in this theory, in essence, he did not leave the rut of the quantity theory. Keynes advocated using interest rate policies and open market policies to maintain the equilibrium between investment and savings. May I ask whether the interest rate policy is derived from and even completely based on the quantity theory of money?</p>
<p>Now let's give some evaluation of Keynes's theory from a factual point of view.</p>
<p>The practical significance of Keynes's currency management is limited expansion. All devaluations, departures from the gold standard, expansion of credit, etc., are manifestations of this point. Due to the departure from the gold standard, devaluation, and the carrying out of foreign exchange wars, and efforts to expand the power of its pound group, Britain has indeed made considerable improvements in its export position in the past two or three years. Let's look at the numbers:</p>
<p>Britain's recent export volume (unit: million pounds, monthly average) (Note 1)</p>
<p>Year</p>
<p>1931——31.55</p>
<p>1932——30.42</p>
<p>1932——30.16</p>
<p>1934——33.00</p>
<p>1915——35.49</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the extent to which the pound has deviated from gold parity in recent years: The development of the pound's devaluation (1929——100) (Note 2)</p>
<p>Year 933——68.1</p>
<p>191——93.2 194——61.8</p>
<p>1931——72.0 193——9.8</p>
<p>According to these two tables, the increase in British exports greatly depends on the gradual devaluation of the pound.</p>
<p>This is another true face of the currency management system: devaluing as much as possible to engage in external competition and the exploitation of colonies. This kind of monetary policy, in terms of foreign affairs, was originally just a powerful weapon to strengthen "the process of transforming from monopoly capitalism to national monopoly capitalism." Now, the power of the pound not only covers the entire British Empire, but also penetrates Scandinavia, South American countries, and others. However, this role played by the currency management system in foreign affairs will only help the world economy to fall into a greater crisis sooner or later, and thus Britain will eventually not be able to remain unscathed alone. How can we talk about price stability in this way?</p>
<p>When the British currency management system began to be implemented, it was the time when the British economy was about to improve. Naturally, this kind of monetary policy gave some stimulation to production; but the increase in British production in recent years mainly benefited from two other factors: the munitions industry and public works (including construction). Let's look at the numbers:</p>
<p>Britain's recent production index (1929——100) (Note 3)</p>
<p>This index tells us that the increase in Britain's recent production index is mostly due to the prosperity of the military industry and public works, because the production of the steel industry has also made great progress (the table is too long to list completely); the automobile industry has also developed considerably; only the production of coal and the production of textiles have made very limited progress. From this, we can get an observation that the improvement of various production departments in Britain is very abnormal; and the textile and coal industries, which have always been in an important position, are now relatively declining; after careful study, we can know that all those that have a direct or indirect relationship with the military industry and public works have made rapid progress, while others are somewhat inferior. Isn't this a false prosperity or gunpowder prosperity containing dangerous seeds? Varga's estimation that Britain's new cyclical economy is maturing (Note 4) is not without basis.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that Britain's monetary policy cannot make the British economy truly improve.</p>
<p>The reason why Britain is still seen as well-off at present, in addition to the above reasons, is also because it obtains huge amounts of interest and shipping income from overseas every year. Britain has ignored its debts to the United States for several years, which is naturally a small compensation for Britain's finances. Moreover, Britain's economic development is the most orderly and very thorough, and the industrial and commercial population accounts for the majority of the total population, so once industry and commerce become active (whether it is normal development or the development of the military industry, etc.), the situation can quickly turn better, which is different from agricultural countries with chronic panic. However, in Britain, the arrival of the economic crisis is also very fast.</p>
<p>Therefore, let alone that Britain's abnormal progress in recent years is not entirely due to Britain's monetary policy? Even if Britain's current abnormal prosperity is mainly due to monetary policy, can this abnormal prosperity containing dangerous seeds guarantee that price stability will continue and the equilibrium of savings and investment will be maintained?</p>
<p>This is the evaluation of Keynes's monetary theory from a factual point of view.</p>

<h3>On the Path of Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Yu Xun</p>
<p>Economic construction, in the strict sense, is to increase investment in production undertakings. Therefore, we can completely discuss the issue of economic construction as an investment issue. What we should study now is how to increase the people's investment in production undertakings. Before answering this question, we should analyze the various factors that determine the amount of investment.</p>
<p>Keynes recently published The General Theory of Employment Money and Interstl, in which he believes that there are two basic conditions that determine the amount of investment, one is the marginal efficiency of capital, and the other is the rate of interest. The marginal efficiency of capital is the general term for all psychological effects regarding the prospect of profit in production. For example, political stability, rising prices, and capitalists' optimism about production will all have expectations to yield, then the marginal efficiency of capital will increase, and production investment will also increase accordingly, and the industry will prosper. Both materials and manpower are on the road to full utilization (Whole Employment). On the other hand, if the interest rate is reduced, the hope of production profit can also be increased, the amount of investment can also be increased, and materials and manpower can also be fully utilized. Conversely, it can cause investors to be suspicious, reduce the amount of investment, industry declines, unemployment increases, and move towards the road of panic. Keynes's statement is indeed more advanced than the general one. We have already followed Keynes's words and recognized that the factors that determine the amount of investment are basically two: one is the industry's hope for the future of production, and the other is the level of interest rates on production funds. Based on these two points, let's take a look at the prospects of domestic investment undertakings.</p>
<p>Since the currency reform on November 11 last year, domestic prices have risen, and producers' hope for the future of production has increased, that is, the marginal efficiency of capital has increased, which seems to be a force that causes Chinese people to increase production investment. At the same time, since the reform of the currency system, the general loan interest rate has also been slightly reduced, which also seems to be a driving force to increase the amount of investment. However, the tension of the international situation and the threat of war crisis have made the production industry completely lose confidence in the future of production, and the marginal efficiency of capital has been particularly reduced due to political relations. Under this situation, even though the interest rate has been quite low, it is difficult to cause the production industry to increase investment in hope and interest. This fact is very obvious. At present, there are very few people in the production industry who dare to boldly expand production. When asked about the reason, they all say that the situation is uncertain and they dare not let go. Some people who dare to purchase production tools and expand production are said to be taking risks by setting an example and doing their best. As for the future, it does not matter. But the so-called risk-taking is only an occasional act of courageous people in the production industry. National industries cannot be built on the psychology of risk-taking. Looking at the loan side of the banking industry, the same feeling of the threat of the international crisis makes long-term capital financing as difficult as before. Even if there is occasional supply of long-term capital, they all admit that this is a kind of risk-taking. Under the threat of war, it is impossible for the banking industry to boldly supply the production industry. In the current extraordinary situation, Marginal Efficiency of Capital can be said to have been reduced to zero. Even if the interest rate is slightly lower, it is difficult to induce a large amount of investment. This is what the facts tell us.</p>
<p>We believe that under the situation of uncertain external relations, it is impossible to induce a large amount of investment. The oppression of foreign political forces is indeed a major obstacle to the rise of national industries. It seems impossible to remove this obstacle, and the purpose of our national economic construction is to remove this obstacle, so there is a contradictory situation in the development of national industries, that is: if national industries cannot develop, national power cannot be enriched, and there will never be the power to remove foreign pressure; if we want to develop national industries and enrich the power of liberation, then foreign pressure makes the development of industries impossible. The current national economic construction is suffocated on this contradictory road.</p>
<p>Many people think that although private investment cannot be increased in large quantities due to the uncertainty of international relations, the government's efforts in construction can replace the people's efforts. However, we believe that this overestimates the government's power and overestimates the contribution under the people's economic principles. Let us take a look at the facts. As of now, the government's construction that can be told is one is the increase in railways, the second is the construction of highways, and the third is the development of water conservancy. However, the so-called railways, highways, and water conservancy only create a favorable environment so that economic and production undertakings can develop. These items are only means to facilitate economic development, and are not the production undertakings themselves. We cannot use trains to make clothes, and we cannot use roads to make daily necessities. This is very obvious. In the absence of production undertakings, transportation will lose its effectiveness. As of now, the government has not directly established cotton weaving factories, flour factories, agricultural tool manufacturing factories, and all other undertakings that directly engage in production. Therefore, the so-called national industry is actually based on private investment in industry as the backbone. The transportation and water conservancy construction in recent years can only be regarded as the government's efforts to create an environment and indirectly make production undertakings develop. It has not participated in direct production activities itself, and the most important point is to enable private investment in direct production undertakings to develop. If we regard the construction of the people's livelihood economy as a problem of building railways and building roads, it is a misunderstanding of the comprehensive meaning of national economic construction. The future of national economic construction still needs to be observed from the national investment in direct production undertakings.</p>
<p>Under the threat of uncertain international relations, Chinese people dare not boldly invest, which means that the rise of national industries is impossible. But for the sake of national salvation and survival, we have to make industries rise. Our current problem is how to solve this contradiction.</p>
<p>The crux of the current problem is that domestic banks and industries dare not fully invest in production undertakings. What we want to study is how to expand domestic production investment under the situation of uncertain international relations. The psychological effect of the people on the future of investment cannot be controlled, that is, Marginal Efficiency of Capital cannot be easily restored by laws or human power. Keynes himself also believes that this is an uncontrollable factor. It seems very impossible for the people to increase investment automatically. Therefore, we have to look for remedial measures from other aspects.</p>
<p>At present, we believe that it is useless to say more, and it is not good to have too high ideals. There is only one way to start from what is possible and feasible. Therefore, we believe that broad theories and plans should be avoided as much as possible when they can be avoided, which is of no help. Therefore, we only intend to propose a low and feasible path, that is, the expanded investment of national banks under the support of national policies, and it is a low-interest investment. This method is very simple, and it includes two points: one is that national banks—that is, the three banks of China—should expand the amount of their investment as much as possible, and the second is that this kind of investment should be low-interest. We will explain it as follows:</p>
<p>First, the conservatism of the three banks of China in investment seems to be no less than that of ordinary commercial banks, which is absolutely harmful from the perspective of national economic construction. If national banks dare not boldly invest, who dares to take money out to take risks. Therefore, the government should use various forces of urging or guaranteeing to make the three banks of China abandon that policy and boldly invest as much as possible. All production undertakings that can be done, should be done, or have been done and have a considerable foundation, should be given financial assistance as much as possible. If the national public banks are like this, other banks will definitely respond, and the amount of investment can be expected to increase universally, and resources and manpower will naturally gradually move towards the road of full utilization. At this critical moment of national crisis, we absolutely cannot tolerate banks locking up production funds in the bank and abandoning the resources, materials and labor that can be greatly utilized to useless ways. Therefore, we suggest that the power of national banks should be used as the vanguard of pioneering the atmosphere. Even if there are some sacrifices, it will not hurt. We must see that the sacrifice of the entire nation is much more important than the sacrifice of some interests of national banks.</p>
<p>Second, the investment of national banks should be conditioned on low interest rates. In his book, Keynes almost regards suppressing interest rates as the only way to rescue panic. He believes that when the industry has completely lost confidence in the future of investment, that is, Marginal Efficiency of Capital is reduced, or even completely collapsed, there is almost no other way but to suppress interest rates and increase investment as a rescue. We believe that the current domestic production industry has reduced its interest in investment due to the tension of the international situation. If we can use the power of national banks to greatly reduce interest rates, it may not be a passive remedial policy. If the loan interest rate can be reduced by half, then the interest burden of manufacturers can also be reduced by half, which can naturally enhance their interest in expanding the industry. Low interest is a policy, and inducing factories to engage in production or expand production activities is the purpose. Since national banks have fully reduced the interest rate, general commercial banks cannot but reduce the interest rate, because if they still adopt the policy of high-interest lock-up funds as in the past, they will gradually be pushed to the corner and live the life of raising worms or mosquitoes. As long as our national banks are responsible, courageous, and decisive, and are not afraid of general bankers stubbornly defending themselves, this is our view.</p>
<p>The above two points are whether people have opinions on economic construction. We have been accustomed to things like "three-year plans," "five-year plans," and "ten-year plans." We don't believe that they are cashable banknotes. Therefore, we just want to put forward a simple opinion. Readers who are accustomed to "plans" and "outlines" may think that what is said above is bland and uninteresting, but we believe that it is not the time to talk about broad plans.</p>
<h3>There are Many Thin Rice Arrivals in the Grain Markets in the North and South</h3>
<p>—Sales are sluggish... prices have fallen across the board (South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were slightly thinner than before, with a total of more than eighty numbers arriving, with a total of 16,780 stones of goods, of which there are still more than fifty numbers of thin rice, and the wholesale and retail sales of thin rice on the market are all slack, so it is difficult for its market to support it, and the opening price continues to be downstream. Yesterday, no more than 5,000 packages were processed from Ping, Jin, Qingyan, Weihaiwei and other gangs, and the market fell by half a corner, and the Middle Pass goods fell by as much as two corners. The thick japonica rice sales were slightly moving, and more than 800 packages of steamed buns were sold. Fortunately, there were not many arrivals, and the market turned stable. Du Yangjian still had no imports and exports, and the Yin Yuan sales were still not refreshing, so its market shape showed a soft image again. (North Zhabei) Yesterday, there were thirty-six or seven ships from various roads under the Suzhou River in Zhabei. The sales of various goods on the market were scattered and the food users were dull. Only the hoarding was slightly moving, so the market shape showed fatigue and weakness. There was no movement in the export of thin rice steamed buns throughout the day, and the street sales were also clear, so the opening of the overall market price of thin rice went down a corner. Yangbu pointed and Du Ke pointed rice, rice gangs and the street sales were all clear, and the price also tended to. The rest of the goods mostly fell more and rose less. Now I will record the market conditions of the ship households on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Most American Cotton Transactions Are Hedges</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with prices for various months rising by one pound-sound to falling by three pound-sounds. Transactions in the market were mostly hedges, with long positions being closed out. Dealers and foreign firms bought in. The December contract was not as active as before. Although many long positions were closed, the market was still tight. Spot cotton prices were firm, but the cloth market was relatively sluggish. There has been no statement from Washington regarding the new cotton plan and the sale of borrowed cotton. At the close, the December contract covered shorts, and the March contract had demand from dealers, stabilizing prices. Spot prices rose by a pound-sound, and futures rose by two to nine pound-sounds. English cotton spot prices fell by one point. Indian cotton was bought by European exporters and sold by spot traders in Pingor, later rising due to short covering. Pingor fell by 1.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 0.25 rupees, and White Broach rose by 0.25 rupees. The original telegraph recorded the above (dated the 28th).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay dispatch, the opening forecast for the 30th predicted White Broach at 118.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupees; Oomra at 198.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupees; and Pingor at 160.25 rupees, up 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Securities: The Public Debt Market Was Quite Good This Week</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange's public debt market last week, during the exchange period between the November futures and the January contract, the market was quite vigorous. This was because, environmentally, the Suiyuan war saw victory at Bailingmiao. Market sentiment followed suit, shifting from weakness to firmness. Rumors spread of large bullish players organizing a bullish company, creating strong momentum, and buying interest was strong. At the beginning of the week, the market price fell due to heavy selling by retail investors, but later rose due to bullish players pushing it up. The upward trend suddenly turned fierce, and purchases of Class A bonds were particularly enthusiastic, repeatedly setting high prices, reaching a peak of 73.65 yuan. The upward trend was unwavering. Moreover, with the support of organized large players, there was no sign of a pullback in the near future. The process for the entire week was as follows: Firstly, the Suiyuan war did not worsen, and public sentiment appeared fatigued, with prices initially falling. However, later, due to purchases by large players, prices rebounded. Secondly, Tuesday was the last day of the November contract, and the market saw severe short squeezes. Large players such as No. 32, 5, and 10 aggressively bought in, and floating shorts rushed to cover, uniformly driving prices up by 35 cents to 1 yuan across Class A, B, C, and D bonds. Thirdly, only December futures were traded on Wednesday. Many retail long positions emerged, and some large players also sold off, causing the market to fall back by about 50 cents. Fourthly, the January contract began trading on Thursday. Bullish large players bought aggressively, and retail investor sentiment also turned firm and bullish, with many buying in, and the trend on the trading floor became increasingly strong, with prices rising by 35 cents to 80 cents across the board. Fifthly, Friday was the delivery day for the November contract, and the market was closed for one day. Sixthly, because the situation appeared temporarily relaxed, bullish large players aggressively pushed prices up, and the upward trend became even sharper. No. 35, 32, and 5 bought aggressively, and Class C, D, E, and F bonds all rose by about 50 cents. Class A bonds were bought by No. 50 and 35, rising sharply by 1.24 yuan. As a result of the entire week, prices for both November and December contracts rose by 67 cents to 90 cents, and Class A December bonds rose by a remarkable 1.60 yuan. The January contract was newly introduced. The total transaction volume was 56,445,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>

<h3>How to Maintain Eternal Love</h3>
<p>Human emotions are extremely prone to change. Without proper connection, love will never be lasting. Sexual love is the original driving force behind the union of men and women. If it can be fulfilled, the river of love will not be disturbed.</p>
<p>Human emotions are changing rapidly, and to keep them in their original state forever, there must be a strong connection and constant stimulation to make the same emotions happen often. Besides that, there is no other method available. So if a couple wants to maintain a strong love forever, there is no other way to do so except to try to find a suitable connection. So what should this connection be? How can this connection be obtained?</p>
<p>We only need to think about what the original driving force that brought men and women together in the primitive age was? Of course, it was sexual life. Since sexual love is the basic driving force of the union between men and women, and since it is the potential force that generates love between men and women, it can naturally be used as a connection to maintain love. From the joy and satisfaction of sex, love constantly gains new life.</p>
<p>So some people thought: sex is a human instinct, and since it is the connection of love, there will be no waves in the river of love in the world. Moreover, because it is an instinct, there is no need to obtain it by artificial means.</p>
<p>But we must know that there are countless people in the world whose sexual function has been hindered and cannot properly perform its duties, making the other party dissatisfied. These people have lost the connection of love and need artificial methods to remedy it.</p>
<p>Originally, many men and women, at the age when their love buds have opened but their development is not yet complete (usually starting from the age of fifteen or sixteen), are tempted by the outside world, causing very strong desires and demanding sexual satisfaction. The most common method is masturbation, and the rest include illicit sex and homosexuality. In short, they are using their sexual organs very early. At this time, the gonads are extremely fragile, and their endocrine secretion must be used to supply the whole body for development. After being illegally destroyed by you, the gonads are weak and unable to develop, and the whole body is weakened. Therefore, in men, there are symptoms such as local shortness, impotence, premature ejaculation, and nocturnal emission; in women, there are symptoms such as sexual frigidity, irregular menstruation, and incomplete development. Those who suffer from this disease are doomed to not having a satisfying sexual life, and the love of the couple is affected. In the river of love, a great storm is inevitable. Those who want to obtain this connection only need to quickly take 'Gonadogen' internally, a gonadal hormone preparation. The agent is divided into male and female types, which are respectively made from the essence of gonadal hormones of strong animals, making the local area larger. However, nocturnal emission must be treated with 'Hemitol Essence-Strengthening Tablets'. 'Female Gonadogen' can cure sexual frigidity, regulate menstruation, develop the breasts, and promote health. It can be said to be a weapon to maintain the love of couples.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: 'Gonadogen' and 'Hemitol Essence-Strengthening Tablets' are generally packed in iron boxes, and those packed in paper boxes are counterfeits.)</p>

<h3>Experiences in Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>In today's existence of the prostitute system, the spread of gonorrhea is rapid and widespread, which is an undeniable fact. However, because it is a nasty disease that harms reputation, many patients are always unwilling to seek medical treatment publicly, and try to take medicine on their own; even when they enter the doctor's door, they all hope to be cured with the simplest method in the shortest period. Cumbersome injections and washing are difficult to be welcomed by patients, and there are even many who delay the treatment of the disease because of this. This is the patient's psychology that I have observed from many years of treating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Doctors should not only cater to the patient's psychology in order to take advantage, but if there is a reliable and practical simple treatment to follow, then why bother the patient with injections and other procedures? Therefore, in recent years, I often use a yellow and vaccine compound preparation, which I call 'Anti-Gonorrhea', as an oral medicine, and have achieved great results.</p>
<p>Originally, the method of treating gonorrhea is nothing more than killing bacteria, because specialized sterilization may cause the residual poison to spread to the inside, so there is also an anti-toxin method. Yellow pigment is a specialized drug for sterilization, while vaccine can produce antitoxins in the blood. The usual injection therapy also uses these two as effective drugs. Now that they are combined into an oral medicine, the application is very convenient; and because it is a combination preparation of two drugs, the two major functions of sterilization and anti-toxicity are carried out simultaneously, without any discrepancies, and gonorrhea has no chance to escape. Compared with the previous separate injections of the two drugs, the efficacy is actually much more certain.</p>
<p>Ordinary oral preparations often have the disadvantage of losing efficacy or damaging the gastrointestinal tract, but in 'Anti-Gonorrhea', Dr. Jeterson, the inventor, has completely solved this difficulty for us.</p>
<p>Common Sense on Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>How I Struggled Out of the Shackles of Tobacco Addiction</h3>
<p>— You Guanhai</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I was unfortunately shackled by opium for eight years. Recently, I was fortunate enough to encounter a good medicine and was able to quit safely. I think the process can be used as a reference for fellow compatriots who want to quit, so I will briefly describe the beginning and end and publish it in a corner of your esteemed journal, and also use it to express my gratitude.</p>
<p>There were smokers in my family. I often chatted beside the opium couch. They often prepared the opium and asked me to try it. After smoking it, I always felt refreshed and enjoyed it endlessly. After seven or eight months, tobacco addiction got the better of me. Looking back later, it was really self-inflicted. At that time, I was only thirty years old, which was the time when I was young, wealthy and strong. I was tall and muscular. After smoking for a year, my appearance began to change. The muscles of my body disappeared, and my skin turned from rosy to sallow; my eye sockets were sunken, and I did not know where my sharp eyes had gone; my face was thin, my back was hunched, and my waist was bent. Occasionally, I looked in the mirror and wondered how I had become so timid.</p>
<p>I felt so miserable and lifeless that I decided to quit three years after becoming addicted. Later, because I was in so much pain that I rolled around on the floor, I had to rekindle my love for opium. After another year, I copied a secret recipe for quitting smoking from a relative. I prepared it according to the method and always thought I would not fail. Who knew that I would copy another old article. This summer, I heard from a friend that he had quit smoking by taking 'Gonadogen', so I hurriedly bought it from the China-England Pharmacy. After taking it for six weeks, I completely quit smoking without any pain, and my spirit improved and my muscles grew. The state of the opium addict has completely disappeared. It seems that I can restore my old state eight years ago. The merits of 'Gonadogen' are truly commendable. If it can be widely adopted, it will not be difficult to eliminate the opium addiction throughout the country. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Enlightenment on Sexuality</p>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianzeng</p>
<h3>From the Harms of Masturbation to the Environment of Children</h3>
<p>…… Playing with the genitals of innocent children is actually a guide for developing future masturbation… … Deliberately making obscene words and actions can often cause children to develop sexual mystery.</p>
<p>Although masturbation is said to be a common disease of young people, it cannot be said that every young person has the bad habit of masturbation. How can we prevent our children from becoming addicted to this bad habit? The most important thing to say is: pay attention to family education and cultivate children's pure minds. It is not difficult to achieve the above goals. As long as the children's environment is not turbid, in a thorough sentence, do not let the children come into contact with bad impressions, so as not to be induced to masturbate.</p>
<p>In general, wet nurses, maids, male servants, bookboys, nannies, etc., often give the children of the main family bad sexual experiences. This is something that must be paid special attention to. For example, it is not uncommon to play with the genitals of innocent children, or to deliberately make obscene words and actions, and to cause sexual excitement.</p>
<p>Also, nannies often tickle and grope the genitals to stop children from crying; these will have bad effects on children.</p>
<p>In addition, in paintings and engravings, obscene paintings with sexual meaning as the main body cannot be kept away from children's eyes. Especially children who are about to enter puberty often attract abnormal sexual excitement and fall into the bad habit of self-selling because of contact with these things. This is really a common occurrence.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that if parents can pay special attention to children when they are young, then the health foundation of adulthood can be consolidated. The reason is that many young people indulge in excessive masturbation, which hinders the development of sexual organs and has become frequent, and sexual function is almost completely lost. In addition, there is also deteriorated neurasthenia, which almost envelops every self-selling youth. We doctors come into contact with these tragic things almost every day. Now, from a medical standpoint, I would like to offer a sincere piece of advice to thousands of victimized young people! You must quit masturbation. Nocturnal emission can deplete endocrine secretion. At this time, you can take 'Hemitol Essence-Strengthening Tablets' to treat it. After taking it, nocturnal emission will stop. If you are deeply victimized and have lost your sexual function, you can take the gonadal hormone preparation 'Gonadogen' to save it. 'Gonadogen' is extracted from the gonadal hormones of strong animals. After taking it, it can turn weak gonads into strong ones. The replenishment of endocrine secretion is not worried about being exhausted. Premature ejaculation and impotence will disappear instantly. The development of sexual organs is nourished by the surging endocrine secretion, guaranteeing gradual transformation. All kinds of neurasthenia symptoms, such as tinnitus, headache, insomnia, and forgetfulness, can be cured in a short period of time.</p>

<p>(1) Underdeveloped and Overlong Foreskin</p>
<p>Patient Tu Minxiu, 24 years old, from Xiaguan, Nanjing, is an antique dealer who has lived in Shanghai for six years and resides in Yongkang Li, Albaister Road, Benfu. (Chief Complaint) -- He had the bad habit of masturbation at the age of sixteen when he had not yet matured. Although he did not commit it every day, he was addicted to it and could not pull himself out. As a result, his endocrine secretion gradually depleted, and his development was hindered. Not only was his penis short, but his foreskin was also too long. Recently, he also suffered from neurasthenia, tinnitus, headache, palpitations, night sweats, forgetfulness, insomnia, and other symptoms. This summer, he came for treatment at the introduction of his friend. (Symptoms at the Time of Diagnosis) -- The length of the penis was less than an inch when still, and only half the size of a normal person when erect, and the testicles were atrophied, the pubic hair was sparse, and there was also third-degree phimosis, with only a small hole left at the front end of the urethra. Urine must first be injected into the foreskin when urinating. In addition, the muscles were thin, the complexion was pale, and neurasthenia was also severe. Nocturnal emission occurred at least three times a week. (Treatment Method) -- Perform planar electrotherapy once a day, strictly guide his health preservation, perform surgery to remove the foreskin, take 'Hemitol Essence-Strengthening Tablets' to treat his nocturnal emission, and treat the underdeveloped and all neurasthenia symptoms with the gonadal hormone preparation 'Gonadogen', taking two tablets three times a day. After two months, the nocturnal emission stopped, and the development of the sexual organs improved, increasing by a quarter compared to the original. At the same time, all neurasthenia symptoms were eliminated, the complexion was rosy, and the muscles gradually became firm.</p>
<p>(2) Premature Ejaculation and Impotence Cured in a Short Period of Time</p>
<p>Patient Huang Guozhong, 35 years old, from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. (Chief Complaint) -- Excessive masturbation in his early years and excessive indulgence in his middle age led to premature ejaculation, impotence and other symptoms, and his mental and physical state was unbearable, so he suffered from frequent nocturnal emission, thin muscles, and pale face. He came for treatment on his own at the beginning of last month. (Symptoms at the Time of Diagnosis) -- The sperm gate was relaxed. Nocturnal emission occurred more than 20 times a month, and sexual function was completely lost. All nutrition was poor, he was mentally depressed, his face was pale, and he felt breathless and weak after a little work. (Treatment Method) -- It was found that Mr. Huang's gonads were greatly damaged due to masturbation and indulgence, and the sperm gate was damaged and relaxed. In addition to daily electrotherapy, he was given 'Hemitol Essence-Strengthening Tablets' to stop his nocturnal emission. After three weeks, the nocturnal emission stopped. The gonadal hormone preparation 'Gonadogen' was used to strengthen his gonads, and premature ejaculation and impotence were completely cured. Not only was his sexual function sound, but he could also fully exert his durability.</p>
<p>Beauty Research</p>
<h3>The Breast Beauty of Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>The importance of breast beauty does not start today. In the Chinese poems of the past, we have already heard many masterpieces praising breasts. However, under the shackles of the old etiquette, no one dared to openly advocate it. Not only that, but they also tightly bound their breasts, hindering their natural development, so old-fashioned women often had painful breasts and weak bodies. The children born to these weak women are often born insufficient and have poor development, so many modern girls are unfortunately born with painful breasts.</p>
<p>At the same time, modern people pay special attention to the beauty of the body's curves. This pair of high-protruding breasts, full and firm, and rich in elasticity, fully reveals the curves and has sufficient attraction to the opposite sex. Furthermore, the high-protruding breasts are a sign of good development, so they are also the foundation of health. If women lose their breast beauty due to congenital deficiencies or later reasons such as masturbation, it is really the greatest loss and cannot be remedied by any cosmetic surgery. And physical weakness is often accompanied by leucorrhea, irregular periods and other symptoms, which should not be easily ignored.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Dr. Stanna, a great Austrian physiologist, invented a female gonadal hormone preparation 'Female Gonadogen', which can promote the development of gonads, make the source of life prosperous, and of course can turn weakness into strength. Painful breasts can also develop to be full and tall, becoming a healthy and beautiful woman. All symptoms such as irregular menstruation, weakness, etc. will naturally be swept away. However, if you also suffer from leucorrhea, you still need to use 'Therapeutic Leucorrhea Mold' as a suppository to eliminate it.</p>

<h3>The Consequences of Protracted and Untreated Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Suffering from bone pain is not an incurable disease, but people often misdiagnose it and cause various complications, or even become a lifelong fetter of happiness. What is the reason for this? Most people ignore the complications of this disease. Generally, more than 80% of people with weak constitutions have preliminary symptoms of bone pain. The preliminary symptom of this bone pain is back pain. If the treatment is mistaken, the bones and joints will feel sore and painful, and sometimes the muscles and collaterals will feel aching. If effective treatment is not sought, the pain will spread throughout the body, from pain to numbness, resulting in hemiplegia. If every person with back pain can take preventive measures early, it is believed that the bad consequences of bone pain cannot be promoted. The method of prevention should be to strengthen energy and improve resistance, so that back pain will never occur. Therefore, people with weak constitutions must use the gonadal hormone preparation 'Gonadogen' to enrich their endocrine secretion and consolidate their energy, so that bone pain loses the opportunity to brew. At the same time, patients with bone pain that has already occurred can take 'Johnstone's Bone Pain Tablets', which are indeed effective in dispelling wind, removing dampness, clearing blood and preventing arteriosclerosis, so its effect can surpass all bone pain drugs and win the support of the medical community at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>Stomach Ache for Seven Years</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have a stomach ache. This disease started in 1930 and has lasted for seven years. Now the disease is very serious and my appetite is not good. I know that the tumor is difficult to cure. Fortunately, Mr. Wang Zhuanyun, who was newly recovered from the same disease, introduced 'Stomach Ache Relief' to treat the pain and 'Stomach Strengthening Essence' to aid digestion. Unexpectedly, the pain stopped immediately after taking it, and my appetite was also good (Fan Rong)</p>
<h3>Plump Breasts</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Although my body is not sick, my breasts are shrinking, causing my classmates to ridicule me as 'Miss Little'. I took it, and after two months, my spirit was extraordinarily full, and my hips and breasts were plump and towering (Fan Shimei)</p>
<h3>Leucorrhea Cured</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have always suffered from leucorrhea. Sometimes it can heal on its own without treatment, and sometimes it is extremely torrential. Although I have taken medicine for treatment, it has not been cured. Then I saw a news report saying that 'Therapeutic Leucorrhea' can cure leucorrhea, so I bought a box from Wing On Company. After external use, it was immediately clean and has not recurred so far. I believe that many people suffer from leucorrhea, so I would like to introduce it specially (Cheng Rui)</p>
<h3>Imbalance After Illness</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>My parents are both weak, so I have been taking medicine constantly. After a serious illness this summer, I became even more embarrassed. Although the disease was cured, my physical strength could not be restored. Then my roommate Mr. Xu told me to supplement it with 'Gonadogen'. After two months, my physical strength recovered, my spirit was greatly boosted, my complexion was rosy, and my muscles were full. Because the effect is indeed effective, I would like to sincerely introduce it as a tonic. Pay attention to those who feel insufficient energy after illness (Sun Liren)</p>

<h3>Only Allowed to Bomb, Not Allowed to Shoot</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>What is the background of this large-scale invasion of Suiyuan by bandits and puppet troops? The world has long seen it. A certain country not only supplied a large amount of military fire, but also sent officers to command it, and used airplanes to participate in the war. The other day, when our army captured Bailingmiao, they had four airplanes that dropped bombs on our army's positions. Three airplanes were shot down by our side. This action of a certain country is a violation of international law. Now it has protested that the airplanes have Japanese national emblems on their wings, and the Chinese army's shooting at the airplanes is tantamount to insulting the Japanese national emblems. I feel even more laughing!</p>
<p>Our country has always been threatened by airplanes from a certain country, and the harm has been not small. The Northeast was bombed away by their airplanes, and Zhabei, Shanghai, was also bombed into a barren land by their airplanes. In the Pingjin area, airplanes from a certain country have recently appeared in the sky from time to time, making the market uneasy. This time, the bandits and puppet troops rashly moved, and the other party became even more active, sending airplanes to participate in the war and repeatedly dropping bombs on our army. In the battle of Bailingmiao, our army shot down three of their warplanes, which was really gratifying! Now they say that shooting at airplanes with Japanese national emblems is an insult. Then what is bombing Chinese land? Is it expressing friendship? Only allowed to drop bombs and bomb people, not allowed to shoot back, is there such a reason in the world!</p>
<p>Now the central government has sent troops to help. The other day, the central air force also sent seven airplanes to reconnaissance enemy traces on the front. But mere reconnaissance is not enough. If they dare to bomb in with airplanes, we should also bomb out with airplanes! Aviation saves the country, and the people of the country are eager for it. To date, the country has equipped a lot of airplanes, and if we do not send them out at this time, when should we wait?</p>
<h3>Burial</h3>
<p>— Liugong Island</p>
<p>For three consecutive days, in the cold wind, trembling voices calling "Guier, come back!" to cheer the soul, whose son is sick?</p>
<p>Time always passes after the evening meal. My wife takes the children to the back room to sleep. I turn a few pages of a book under the lamp or prepare a little of the work I need to do tomorrow. On winter nights, this large compound is as silent as death. The sound of hawkers selling candied hawthorns is so distant, as if in a dream. The call of "Guier, come back!" to cheer the soul seems to be right outside my paper window; this makes me stop the work I'm doing and cock my ear to listen to the origin of the sound. It is the accent of my hometown in the South. That faint and hoarse voice is answering, "Coming back!"</p>
<p>I wanted to look out through the crack in the window. Outside the window, it was pitch black, as if there were a dim lantern moving in the distance. Are they two poor strangers searching for their son's joyous soul?</p>
<p>The next morning, I asked my wife whose Guier was sick. She replied that it was the son of the carpenter Baogen, who lived in the back near the cowshed. I seemed to have seen that poor middle-aged man, with a pale face and always wearing an ill-fitting, baggy suit. But he walks so nimbly that when he passes my window, he disappears in a flash.</p>
<p>We are both wanderers stranded in a foreign land. I recalled my wife's anxious face when our child was sick, and I prayed that the poor little life would be safe and sound soon!</p>
<p>But for three consecutive days, the sound of calling the soul came in the cold wind just as I was about to start doing something, neither early nor late. A surge of sympathy made me pace anxiously in the room. I wonder how sick the poor child is?</p>
<p>Last night, anticipating the sound of calling the soul, I lay in a chair smoking a cigarette. How could I have the heart to prepare for the work I needed to do tomorrow! The trembling "Guier, come back!" seemed like countless sharp needles piercing my heart. At the same time, a sunken, pale face appeared before me. Perhaps he can't take medicine anymore. When the bitter medicine is poured into his slightly open mouth, he is not stubborn at all, and no longer cries "Bitter! Bitter!" He uses his small hand to push away the spoon his mother handed over. The medicinal juice only rolls around in his throat before being completely spit out, and the dark yellow liquid hangs from the corner of his mouth to his neck, and the pillow is stained with a large pile of water stains. At this time, can you bear to look at the face of the mother with tightly knitted eyebrows?</p>
<p>So she stood up helplessly, glanced at her husband standing blankly by the bed, trembling, lit a paper candle, walked almost on tiptoe, and gently slipped out of the bedroom. The wind outside the room was cutting their faces like a knife? She shivered, wrapped her ragged scarf, or even a cloth strip, tightly around her head, carefully searching for the joyous soul all the way, calling "Guier, come back!"</p>
<p>It was exactly as if I had witnessed it myself. My heart was closely following their backs, and I answered them in a low voice: "Coming back!" I sat in a daze like this until midnight, and my legs were almost numb, but I did not hear the call of "Guier, come back!" I secretly rejoiced that the poor little life had been saved, and his mother was probably holding him in her arms in surprise, humming a lullaby to put him to sleep?</p>
<p>However, how can I describe what happened this morning? Can I tell you that the poor child died last night?</p>
<p>The carpenter himself carried a small vermillion-painted coffin past my window, his steps still as nimble as before. His wife followed behind, already unable to cry, a long snot hanging from her lips. She looked up at the blue sky and stumbled along to the burial.</p>
<p>I stood there stunned. I thought of my home in the South. My mother had written me twice, asking me to go home to see my son!</p>
<p>Snow was falling outside the window, and the wind grew stronger. I closed the paper window.</p>
<h3>When Even Plain Boiled Water Isn't Available</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>Yesterday, I rushed out early in the morning, hoping to meet an acquaintance, preferably a completely unexpected encounter. If only he had a little money…</p>
<p>Until evening, I was in despair.</p>
<p>Walking west along the cool Avenue Joffre, all the way to Rue Massenet, I turned into a slightly secluded place. The wind forcefully wove a net with the sand, fiercely pouncing on me as if I were a fish. But I broke through, the net with a big hole, falling forward… Yes, I was victorious.</p>
<p>Maybe Lao Li is at home? He'll be home. Today, I am victorious. Who can defeat me? No one can defeat me…</p>
<p>I quickened my pace, stepping on the withered autumn grass, very pleased with myself. Reaching the alley entrance, people looked at me, but I ignored them and ran straight to the back door of Lao Li's place. Then, the window in the garret was dark. I didn't know what to do. Maybe he's sick? He often gets sick. No, he was fine yesterday. Maybe he went to the theater? No, he doesn't have money. So, he didn't go out?</p>
<p>I looked at the window. The window was open, but there was no light, dark and still. The curtains swayed on both sides, like little girls who had just learned to dance. Yes, maybe…</p>
<p>"Lao Li!" I cupped my hands around my mouth: "Lao Li! Lao Li!"</p>
<p>There was no echo. Instead, someone in another window poked their head out to look, then closed the window again. The alley was very quiet, as if Lao Li had taken everything away.</p>
<p>Disappointed, I went to Lao Mao's place.</p>
<p>Lao Mao wasn't home either, but I knew where he kept his key. I went into the house and looked at the desk, where there was nothing but a dog-eared book, not a single copper coin. Opening the drawer, it was also empty. Damn it! Why doesn't he carry even a single copper coin?</p>
<p>Disappointed and yet excited, I sat on the squeaky chair that sounded like a mouse, staring blankly at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Then, I searched through all the places again. There was nothing I needed.</p>
<p>So, tomorrow even boiling half a copper coin's worth of water will be impossible…</p>
<p>Returning home, I pulled out the letter I had written to my family: “…Life here is very happy…” This is a happy life? A play once depicted a group of college students who could only drink plain boiled water. As for me, tomorrow… tomorrow everything will be over!</p>
<p>I looked at the empty cup, the empty water bottle, and the empty desk and drawers.</p>
<p>But when I thought of that "tomorrow" and the things I do every day, my heart was filled with boundless warmth. I let my mind wander, and when I thought of tense situations, my chest also tensed up, throbbing!… My mouth was dry, a need was forcing me…</p>
<p>Tomorrow, ah…</p>

<p>After the Eight-Nation Alliance captured Beijing and Tianjin, not only did the imperialists' iron hooves rape, pillage, and burn everywhere, but gangsters and petty thieves also took the opportunity to loot and exploit the common people. Sai Jinhua was also one of the refugees. Because she knew German and happened to know the commander of the Alliance forces, the German General Waldersee, she was taken to see Waldersee.</p>
<p>With Sai Jinhua's beautiful appearance, she immediately won Waldersee's favor. At that time, the Alliance forces were wantonly harassing the people, and the people were naturally afraid of their lewd power and fled, but the imperialists also couldn't obtain military supplies. Therefore, they wanted Sai Jinhua to be the commissary officer. Sai Jinhua, who had a sense of justice and loved her nation, took the opportunity to offer her advice. Her words saved countless people.</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying, "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Sino-Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter: "Zhuge Liang"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhuge's appellation was Sleeping Dragon. Not seeking fame, he dwelled in Longzhong, restraining his knees and chanting away the years. With a feather fan and silk scarf, he had the air of a recluse. Tilling the fields in Nanyang was his steady plan. Liu Bei came to visit him three times in the snowstorm. He had already calculated the three-way division of the empire. Burning the camp at Bowang was his first achievement. After the defeat at Dangyang, he resided at Xiakou. Because Cao Cao's military strength was extremely strong, he pretended to mourn and asked Zijing to come and invite him. He went to Jiangdong in a small boat. He debated with the Confucian scholars amidst laughter. He wrote the Bronze Sparrow Terrace Rhapsody to provoke Zhou Gongjin. He displayed his supernatural powers to borrow arrows and the east wind. In the State Mother Temple, he selected a son-in-law. The new embroidery courtyard produced a hero. It was difficult to escape from Mr. Zhuge's ingenious calculations. Zhou Lang used the beauty trap. He set three ingenious plans in silk pouches and handed them over to Zhao Zilong of Changshan. He captured Meng Huo seven times, and the Miao barbarians submitted. He launched six expeditions to Qishan, exerting himself to the utmost. He restored the two regions of Sichuan and achieved the emperor's cause. Before his death, the First Emperor entrusted him with his final affairs. He performed the ceremony to pray for the stars, but the fire was not blessed. He transformed into a gentle wind at the Wuzhang Plains. Nine expeditions to the Central Plains will establish later achievements. The memorials before and after the expedition are still here, causing those who read them to be stained with tears. To this day, his name has entered the palace of saints.</p>
<p>He Yunfang, He Qinfang, "Double Ball"</p>
<p>Yuan Chang (1120) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter: "Consort Mei"</p>
<p>The wind and rain are timely, celebrating peace. The Tang Ming Emperor was a man who loved beauty and was devoted to captivating cities. The palace ladies lost their luster. Only Consort Mei's talent and beauty were unmatched. Her eyebrows were like willows, her hair like clouds. Her beautiful face and figure were naturally beautiful. The romantic Emperor enjoyed her favor, spending mornings and evenings together under the flowers and moon. It was truly said that their love was as deep as the sea. Who knew that the jealous Yang family woman, with her sleeves covering her face, was scheming and deceitful. Her beautiful eyebrows were newly selected to enter the palace. She competed for favor and love with jealousy, and her foxy charm was able to bewitch the supreme ruler. From then on, music and drums resounded day and night in the other courtyard. Here, I am lonely and desolate in the courtyard. Autumn waters are worn through but the horse does not come. Loving the new and forgetting the old, men have always been fickle. Before the autumn wind rises, the fan is discarded. It broke the hearts of how many beauties in the world. Consort Mei was, alone in longing and heart-rending thoughts. Only the candles have a heart and shed tears until dawn. Before long, the barbarian rebels ascended the golden palace, all for that hundred-charming and thousand-charming Yang Taizhen. The storm and rain urged them on. The beautiful woman's soul was broken, leaving behind only her fragrant bones, buried forlornly in the Plum Forest.</p>
<p>Jiang Binchu, "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Sound (1380) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening Chapter: One of the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, "Zeng Shen Bites His Finger in Heartbreak"</p>
<p>The countryside is desolate and remote, with fishermen, woodcutters, farmers, and scholars filling the town. Recluses often emerge from the deep mountains, living out their days in humble thatched huts. Most are carefree and leisurely guests, composing poems under the moon and secretly lamenting. There is a handsome young woodcutter, but he is actually Zeng Shen, a virtuous man who carries firewood into the mountains. He receives the teachings of Confucius and is extremely filial to his mother. The whole village knows Zeng, the filial son, and his good reputation has spread throughout the town. One day, Zeng Shen went into the mountains to chop wood and buy rice for his filial mother. Unexpectedly, a guest arrived at his home, and his mother was at a loss on how to treat the guest. Her purse was empty and she had no good plan, with neither wine nor food nor money. Hoping that her son would return quickly but not seeing him, she was anxious in her heart, wondering what to do. Knowing that the mother and son were connected by blood, she bit her finger with determination. Zeng Shen felt a pain in his heart. He hurriedly returned home carrying firewood and knelt down to ask his mother why. Zeng's mother then opened her mouth and said that a guest had come to her humble home. Because you had not returned, I had little to offer, so I bit my finger to send you a message to return home. What a truly virtuous and filial son Zeng Shen was! Such profound affection is rare in the world. He understands the truth and wisdom.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Opera Company has recently released four new single-sheet songs: "Your Lover Is Him," "Brave Youth," "Spring Flower," and "Goodbye Friend," combined into one set, finely printed on 140-pound paper. They are being given away to listeners who love songs. For mail requests, whether local or out-of-town, please include a postage fee of 5 cents.</p>
<p>Zhou Mingyuan's new song, "Love's Lingering," has the following lyrics: (1) My love! Since we parted, I have always been sadly in my heart. I have written letters, but there is no way to send them. In this spring light, my heart is filled with melancholy, and the peach blossoms seem shy. The willows also bow their heads, and a gentle breeze blows, the mirror is clear, and I am filled with sorrow because I can't make up my mind about how beautiful this week is. I long to make up my mind. Although death can rest, separation is even more difficult to endure. At this time, the dream of separation is already fulfilled, only adding tears to flow! I regret that we became acquainted, and the source of our love is difficult to restrain. Recalling the past, a stream of warmth flows through my heart forever. Oh, my love! Youth is fleeting and cannot last forever. Do not betray our deep affection! (2) My love! Since you left, I have always been lonely and too sad. You sang with your jade throat, a sad melody, this elegant and secluded voice, lingering by my side. I dare not look back, the wind and snow are also together, walking hand in hand is better than riding a boat, the night is hazy, the drizzle does not stop, this street, I do not want to walk again. Half a year of friendship, emotions stronger than ten autumns, at this time, the friend in wind and snow, once separated, how can you forget the bitterness. From now on, it will be difficult to find a good friend, Jinyun, the two shadows remain on my desk, only adding old hatred and new sorrow, my love! Spring scenery is not easy to keep, in the blink of an eye is autumn, I hope you will not stay any longer!</p>

<h3>"Entwined Love" to be Screened in Nanjing</h3>

The film will have its Far East premiere at the Nanjing Grand Theater at 9:15 PM on December 3rd. The leading roles are played by Norma Shearer, who played the female lead in "A Free Soul," and the famous stage actor Leslie Howard. The supporting actors are also top stars, such as John Barrymore and Olivia de Havilland. The film is directed by George Cukor. George has previously directed classic literary films such as "David Copperfield" and "Little Women," and his achievements have undoubtedly left a very deep impression on audiences who have seen the above two films. MGM produced the film, sparing no expense to gather various technical personnel to work on the production, aiming to ensure that the costumes and sets were as realistic and extraordinary as possible. The film took two and a half years from planning to completion. When it was released in major cities in the United States, all the newspapers unanimously praised it as an unprecedented success.</p>
