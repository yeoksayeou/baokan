<h3>論成都的不幸事件</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>中日兩國凡是愛好和平的人們對於本月二十四日所發生的成都事件一致地痛感着萬分的遺憾因為這事件在民族的感情上給予着很大的刺戟性而這種刺戟性的發展是有危害東亞和平的可能的</p>
<p>現在我們還不能完全明白這次不幸事件的根本原因但是單從巳經知道的各種消息也就可以得到下列的兩個結諭</p>
<p>第一在這次意外的事變裏犧牲了生命的除了我國的民衆和軍警以外就是大阪每日新聞記者渡邊和上海每日新聞記者深川這兩位日本記者都是奉了報館方面的派遣去担任通信的職務的這次在我國的內地平白地遭受了暴徒的殺害無論如何在我國其有理智的人們都不能不感覺到深切的同情我們從大國民的觀點對於一切操着和平職業的任何外僑都應當愛護得同本國的同胞一樣因此我們不但從心底悲悼着那兩位從事於和平工作的日僑而且在這次事件之後更加認識到宣揚人類博愛精神的重要以及淺薄的國家主義者在羣衆運動無的放矢的危險</p>
<p>第二中央和各省的行政當局這幾年來對於各國僑民尤其是日本僑民的保護不能不說是已經盡了全力年來我國境內日僑的增加和日貨的暢銷就是顯著的證據然而意外的暴烈事變在政治嚴明的日本尙且不能避免何况在國難深重的我國這次成都事件的發生雖可說是由於地方當局的疏於防範但是就暴動分子過激的感情來分析一下實在多少有些日本軍人五年來所種的惡果從這一點看來顯然只有在絕封尊重我國獨立主權的條件之下來調整中日兩國的國交才可以防止此後再有類似的不幸事件發生</p>
<p>我們希望着中日兩國眞要維持東亞和平的人們都用冷靜的理智來考慮這一次的不幸事件</p>

<h3>德國戰鬥力的估計　（下）</h3>
<p>— 法國×將軍作　月祺釋</p>
<p>其决，讓我們考察製造軍需的原料—如金屬，紗線，橡皮，燃料，右油之類，及利用這些原料製成槍砲，布疋，輪胎，汽油，彈藥的工廠。換一句話，就是讓我們考察德國的工業可能度。</p>
<p>德國的含鐵金屬生產，本不發達。洛林（Lorraine）礦塲被奪，又使牠的余屬資源比大戰前减少三分之二·目前，在每年鐵礦消費量一六，七〇〇，〇〇〇噸中，六，〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸是本國生產，餘額，則藉國外輸八。帕拉替內特（Palalinate）和南巴登（SouthBalen）二地的鐵礦開掘成功後，每年產額可增加一百萬噸。但無論如何，僅藉國內生產總是不够消費的。</p>
<p>固然，德國正在大量輸人鋼鐵以預防戰時受封銷危險，但其中半數是山法國供給的，而法國正是牠在未來戰爭中的敵國，這大量供給是否持久是頗成問題的。由他國十瑞典為最多—供給的究占少數，决不能彌補牠在戰爭時期的缺乏。</p>
<p>德國幾乎沒有銅鑛；曼斯爾特公司（Manslield　Company）的銅鑛，所供給的，只有消費量百分之十：在一九三四年全部消費量二八七，〇〇〇噸中，本國生產的僅二八，〇〇〇噸。美國，南非，比利時剛果，智利等國所供給的輸入，到戰爭發動時就要停止；不論貯量如何充足，不久吿竭是無疑的。德國深明此項危險，所以牠正在努力用鋁代銅及其他牠所缺乏的余屬——鋅，錫等。</p>
<p>德國的鋁生產，居全世界第一。一九三三年，產額達一八·〇〇〇噸；于九三四年，述四六·〇〇〇噸；一九三五年，達五二·〇〇〇噸。但他缺乏製鋁的原料。牠的鐵礬土和冰晶石生產幾乎等於零：一九二九年，產鐵礬土僅七·三〇〇噸；一九三四年，鐵礬土人超達三二六·五〇〇噸。為預防牠的主要供給國（法國，匈牙利，南斯拉夫，意國，）在戰爭時停止供給起見，德國正在努力於從本國土壤的泥塊中提鍊鋁質。據德國報紙宣稱，這問題已可解决，但證明此項消息的事實尙未出現。</p>
<p>德國的織物原料很不充足。在全部亞麻與大麻消費量中，由本國供給的至多不過百分之十；天然絲和棉，幾乎沒有。因此，德國不得不設法補救，如擴充植麻面積，增加羊毛產量，製造人造絲，發明混合糧微織物等。</p>
<p>至於煤，我們可以從兩個數字去觀察：全年消費量計二七五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸；全年產量計　八一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸。</p>
<p>德國的條麟吉亞（Thuringia）　漢諾威（Hanover）一地，俱以產石油著名全國，那里油井很多。在最近數年中，牠們的產量已增加四倍。一九三五年，產量達一〇四，〇〇〇噸。但與德國的油消費量（一九三四年達三，三二二，〇〇〇噸）相比，這產量就微小得很。</p>
<p>把石油放開不提，單看機器油（汽油和石油精）的情形吧。一九三五年，汽油消費量達一，二一八，〇〇〇噸，全國汽油製鍊廠的產額僅一五〇，九九九噸，相差竟逾一百萬噸，幸而德國的煤和亞炭非常豐富，而且藉專門家的硏究這二種原料可以製成汽油。從煤渣製造汽油的留那廠（Leuan　Warks）於一九二九年成立，本年產額可望增至三五〇，〇〇〇噸〇一九三二年，茂斯堡（Nessebrug）某工廠試騐亞炭加氫成功，以後每年可從亞炭製成汽油三〇〇，〇〇〇噸。一九三四年十月，從事汽油製造業的廓郞科林公司（Braunkohlen　Cmpnyao）成立，資本達一萬萬馬克。</p>
<p>從現在起，德國可製造合成汽油六五〇，〇〇〇噸，加以從油井產生的汽油一五〇，〇〇〇噸，每年汽油產額可達八〇〇，〇〇〇噸。再過若干年，德國的汽油生產可與消費相應。可惜的是合成汽油不適用於飛機引擎；把全部自然汽油供給飛機引擎當然也是不可能的。</p>
<p>那麽，德國的航空問題仍然沒有解决。但到將來總會解决，到了這問題解决時，德國的武力至少會增加一倍。</p>
<p>另一種重要燃料石油精，生產差不多和需要相應：消費三二〇，〇〇〇噸，生產二八〇，〇〇〇噸，至於酒精，生產足够供給消費。總之，藉化學家的智慧和技師的才能，德國可於不久藉合成產物彌補天然的缺乏。</p>
<p>工業動員是現代軍事的　複雜的問題之一。在和平時期製造軍需的工廠的數量，到了戰爭時期就嫌不足。例如：在一九一四年末期，德國造砲工業每月造大砲一百尊。至一九一八年六月，德國軍隊每月需大砲至千尊，但仍不慮缺乏。為使這生產標準實現起見，國內所有工廠必須全部動員，全部參加消費無限量的軍械的製造。</p>
<p>德國的工業可能度是無比的。前决大戰已給予我們大量的証據：白砲三千尊，炸彈一千一百萬枚，機關槍一萬四千架，步槍二十五萬枝，火藥一萬二千噸。這些數量不算稀奇，因為敵國也可照數置備。但危險的所在，却是：德國的全部工業目前已專門對付製造軍需，其組織亦和戰時相同。牠的動員時期已經完了，到了戰爭發動時為改造工廠所必需的停頓時期幾乎可以沒有，而在他國則迢樣的停頓時期至少需六個月以上。</p>
<p>工業勢力强大，但原料不足—這是德國的二大特微。德國能贍養自己。牠能比任何其他歐洲國家生產得更多更速。可是，在重要原料可不藉國外輸人這目的未達到以前，牠的巨大的努力總是要落空的。在估計德國的戰鬥力的時候，可被認為唯一缺陷的就是這一點。（譯自Vu周刋）</p>

<h3>上海西人足球會改組運動　在猛烈進行中　台維遜氏計劃根本改組西人會　初級球隊能否贊成為成敗關鍵</h3>
<p>上海西人足球會、操縱着上海中西足球界的權威、其內容組織、二十年來、從未變更、無論上海的甲乙組聯賽、杯賽、國際杯賽、以及埠際賽等等、都由該會支配、大權獨攔、所謂一元花的管理、但是這種管理和內容組織、據最近從英國回來的足球專家觀察、說已是落伍而不合潮流了、應該立刻的改紙一下、按照英國的方法、使成為近代的足球會、最先提出這改組的呼聲的、是一位由蘇格蘭來滬的專家呌台維遜、在去年的上海西人足球會年會中、台維遜會經一度把他的改組計劃提出來、結果呢、台維遜是失敢了、上海西人足球會還是照舊的組織和管理、今年西人會年會、又定期不日召集、台維遜在去年失敗後、又準備今年捲土重來的第二次提出、如此一個很大的問題、影響整個的上海中西足球界、將來能否成立和通過、很值得體育界的注意、</p>
<p>台維遜的　改組計劃</p>
<p>台維遜改組上海西人足球會最重要的內容、是要把目下一元化管理制、改為雙　管理、就是要把甲乙組的聯賽、脫離西人足球會而獨立、不過受着西人會的監督和指揮、甲組聯賽的足球隊、聚集起來、自巳管理舉行甲組聯賽、乙組聯賽由乙組球隊自行管理和舉行比賽、至於銀杯賽、國際賽和埠際賽、則由西人會來處理、如此呢，最大的利益、是使聯賽和銀杯賽、處於同等重要的地位、在目下的狀態中、每年常見西人會趕快把銀杯賽結束後、就草草的聯賽、馬馬虎虎作一結束、在球會自己處理之下、不至有這樣的情形、第二點球員有一個上訴的機會、目下情形、球員被罰、無處伸訴、在新制度中、聯賽被罰的球員、可以伸訴到上級機關西人足球會去、這是台維遜改組內容的要點、</p>
<p>成敗重心　在初級隊</p>
<p>這計劃、雖然予目下的上海西人足球會以致命傷、因為聯賽獨立後、經濟方面、要受到莫力打擊、最大的門票收入、是在聯賽的比賽中、高級球隊、大半贊成這計劃、因為門票收入經濟不生間題、初級球隊却門票收入毫無希望、所以這計劃的成敗重心、就全在這許多初極球隊、去年台維遜計劉的失敗、就因為初級球隊被西人會拉攏、遂表示反敗、今年的成敗、還是要仰仗他們初級球隊、但是聽說西人會方面、也已在進行布置中了、（鎭）</p>

<p>婦女專刊救我們自己  俞章梅君　　解放女權的呼聲與運動，現在正積極地向前邁進擴展，以求得男女平等的眞正實現的一天，我們女子束縛的罪苦，確也受够了，我們再不努力解救，使我們女子得抬起頭來，難遺眞甘願永遠埋沒着，被人麼迫奴視着，忘記自己應得的權利，捨棄自己應享的幸福，而一輩子儘做着男子的玩偶嗎？　　雖然，我們天生成是母性，生育子女，是我們的天職，家政的治理，也有一部份應盡的責任，但在國家社會的組合中，我們也是國民的一份子，那我們自然也該享有與男子同等的公民權利囉！然而為甚麼我們要受傳統的束縛呢？親愛的姊妹們啊！要解放我們的束縛，要求得眞正的平等，先要把我們自己心中的傳統觀念驅除，那末才有眞正平等解放的一天。　　很多女子，伊自己甘願把自己束縛起來，並傳統的默認自己是男子的專利品，試舉一個平常的例來說：譬如有一個陌生男子，誠意的想帮助一個携着重物的女子，這男子的舉動，不但要被旁人譏笑，駡作登徒，而伊也會認那男子不懷善意，倘恰巧碰着女方的甚麼人，或便是女的丈夫，則更將因此引起嫉妒與嚴重的衝突了。　　互助，本是人類美德，並不一定是施之弱者的恩惠，我們為甚麼不能接受不相識者的帮助呢？旁觀者為甚麽要鄙視譏笑呢？自己丈夫，為甚麼要嫉妒衝突呢？簡單的說，這純粹因為女子的地位，完全是在傳統支配的指揮下，到如今仍逃不出專制思想的桎梏，所以有這許多歧視，我們女子之不能獲得眞實平等地位，就是被這社會歧視所障碍呵！　　親愛的姊妹們，要解放我們束縛，想獲得眞正平等，求享有公民完全權利，第一：我們必須校正這種社會的歧視。第二：則應革淸自己所中傳統的毒質，重視自己的人格，始終不畏縮讓步。　　我願全國的姊妹們，大家精神團結起來，努力於正軌前衝，做一個眞正二十世紀的新女性，預備向國民大會中努力。世界婦女名人傳（二）  魯沙白　　與克魯普斯卡耶齊名的尼古萊夫，也是黨中央委員之一。本年二月在聯邦中央執行委員會幹部會上和夏波希尼科同時被選，並兼任政府機關要職。　　她在蘇聯女政治家中是一個佼佼者。然而她因為沒有像列寗夫人和列寗的姊妹那樣有特殊關係，她之所以能獲得了今日的成功，是經過了無數的艱難因苦和奮鬬的。她有過人的聰明和敏銳的眼光，所以在歷年黨內的糾紛中能够觀察到各方面的關係，來運用她的靈活的手段，而始終保持着她的政治地位。有一個期間，她也曾和列寗夫人等同站在反對派的立塲，受過斯太林峻烈的批評，然而她不但不憤恨斯太林，反而變成一個五年計劃的熱心擁護者。尼古萊夫　　她已經是一個中年的婦人，但在一九二六年仍然入了共產黨大學，而不以半途出家自餒，並且埋頭研究列寗主義，和推進社會主義的建設，頗得斯太林的信任，這種精神確是值得佩服的。　　她生長在貧窮的家中，十一歲時曾做過製本所的女工，在閑暇時常手不釋卷，因此染受到革命的思想。疑來她認識了柯倫泰，很快就變成左傾份子，因此入獄，出獄疑開始做着下層工作，十六歲時便做了黨員。今年她才四十二歲，在蘇聯女政治家中，以她最有希望。　　以一個文學家，而兼政治家外交家革命家於一身的，在現代女性中恐怕只有柯倫泰了吧她在我們中國也很知名，她所著的『赤戀』『二代戀變』等文藝作品　在中國很受到一般靑年男女的歡迎。　　她生於一八七二年，父親是一個將軍，家中很有財產，在外國大學畢業疑又到法國留學，精通英法德等國語言，曾參加第二國際，盡力婦女勞動組合運動，歐戰時加入少數派，被法國政府驅逐出境，逃亡到美國。一九一七年十月革命後便回到國內，成為布爾塞維克之一員，一九二三年到二六年任挪威公使，繼任墨西哥公使，一九二七年又　任挪威公使。柯倫泰　　她的相貌很美，酷愛一裝飾，外表純粹是一個布爾喬亞的典型，和蘇聯其他的一班女革命家逈然不同，這也是因為她出身於貴族家庭的緣故。最初曾在製本所擔任秘密工作，煽動女工參加革命，前面介紹的尼古萊夫，便是她訓練成功的一個。她具有煽動的能力，富有火一般的熱情，一生都過着愛的生活，現在雖然有了六十三歲的高齡，仍然有着六七個愛人。　　對於理論方面，她也有相當修養，曾寫過很多關於婦女問題的著作，最著名的是『經濟進化上的婦女勞動』一書，這是她在莫斯科瑞爾德洛夫大學的講義，是倍倍爾『婦女與社會主義』以疑的最有價值的文獻。舊禮教之下的我  毛碧秋　　古時祗有男子從師，女子要在父母管束之下不可越雷池一步，我是一個未曾讀過書的女子，以淺陋，惡劣的文字，來談談我經過的情形：　　在光緒二十餘年的時候，邦江就開辦了女子公學，一班頭腦新的家長，當然送女兒入校讀書，預備伊們將來的出路，而我的父母腦筋非常之舊，說的女兒須學曹大家作的女四書，女子不可出閨門于步，不能與男子平等，女子無才便是德……　那麼一大套含有封建思想的話，就害了我終身不淺，從此看人家讀書識字，看人家出外謀生，而我却永遠陷在阱裏了！我的父親是在庠的，他的身體非常衰弱，原因是他在進考塲時受了風，得了咳喘病，終日萎靡不振，有數十年之久，因之，我的識字的希望更不能實現，我所認識的幾個字，是在幼年父親高興時所教的，民國元年我的父親棄我而逝，從此以後述問字的人都沒有了，母親是舊禮教之下的征服者伊那三寸金蓮，及那掃地的長裙充分的表現着是受過封建制度薰陶的，伊不識一字，祗會做封建制度的播送者，命我們裏足，不許我們出門，唉—不幸的我，竟也受了封建的荼毒。　　我那時要是進學校謮一點書，不至於現在一竅不通，過家庭的死生活，這是我終身的憾事。　　我的年紀已有四十，在前年精神上受了重大的刺激，身體因之也日趨孱弱，現在想學點學問，事實上也不可能了，唉！祇有眼瞪着時代的輪子向前邁進，使得我望塵莫及，親愛的同志們！努力吧！打破這束縛女子身心的舊禮教，奠定各人的根基，來加入新時代的集團裏去，為個人圖生存，為家庭謀福利，為社會創事業，為國家爭光榮！婦女的美容術  胡野吟　　目今美容術盛行，允其是那輩太太小姐們。吾鄉諺語笑人遲鈍曰：「大小姐摸不出繡房門」，眞有些道理。我曾有一次陪一位太太和一位小姐去看影戲，她們都是在一點鐘的時侯開始裝飾，可是等到走進戲院，正片已經開始啦！所以，現在，我最怕的便是陪太太小姐們出去玩；到不是怕別的，怕她們化妝時的精細得太使人不耐煩。　　俗語說得好：「三分人材，七分打扮」。可見化妝之於婦女，原是不可缺乏的事。不過，我們並不希望太過份，如果有七分人材，那末，最好是免掉那三分打扮還來得好些。　　日來閒得克聊，翻閱閒書，於搜神記中得婦女之美容術一條云。　　「漢桓帝元嘉中，京都婦女作「愁眉」「啼妝」「墮馬鬃」「折腰步」「齲齒笑」。「愁眉」者，細而曲折，「啼妝」者，薄拭目下若啼處，「墮馬鬃」者，作一彎。「折腰步」者，足不在下體。「齲齒笑」者，若齒痛，樂不欣欣。始自大將軍梁冀妻孫壽所為，京都翕然，諸夏效之。……」　　上面所謂「愁眉」「啼妝」等，在現在，我們還可找到，祇有「墮馬髻」一項則無，蓋今人不蓄髻，「愁眉」，在現在可以找到許多細而折的眉毛：「啼妝」，電影明星談瑛之眼有其風味；「折腰步」，着一英寸高之高跟鞋者，有其風姿；「齲齒笑」雖不能多見，然我信必定有之。　　由此看來，婦女之美容術，中國古時已頗盛行，宜其於今有如此偉大之發展也。可是，請看搜神記所加以的評語「天戒若曰」：兵馬將往收捕；婦女憂愁，愁眉啼哭，吏卒掣頓，折其腰脊，令髻邪傾；雖強語笑，無復氣味也。」到延熹二年，冀舉宗合誅。」　　所裏所加的評語，雖頗刻薄；而其創始又遭舉宗合誅，可見好為異妝之事，有擾社會，有害於國家，結果祇能以合誅報之。　　現在新生活運動，不主張婦女化妝得十分妖艷，我認為極有道理。一則可省去許多時問作其他有益之工作，二則可以省去許多金錢流溢到外國，三則當此國難重重之際，豈婦女們「齲齒笑」之時呢？　　希吾女同胞，仝心協力，拋棄此等區區小事，而　　處邁步前進！爲他人作嫁衣裳  　　做了母親的我  志良　　我到了念三歲的那年春天，剛才做了小母親，雖然我們早在我廿歲的時候就結婚了，祇是為了自己的事業奔走，會少離多，一向過着孤單淸苦的生活！　　在我沒有小孩子之前，做了幾年小學教員，一天釗晚老在小孩子的隊伍裏過慣了，覺得自己也像一個大孩子，我愛他們的舉動，活潑靈敏，我愛他的言詞，淸脆率直，我更愛他們的純潔坦白的心，跑起步來像小狗跳，哭是眞的哭，笑是眞的笑，同時我也願望着自己也有一個出類拔萃的可愛的小天使！　　可是做母親遠沒有像我理想中的那麽簡單，容易，撫養孩子，正和農夫種植禾稼沒有兩樣，倘使沒有春耕夏耘的辛苦，也就是得不到秋收冬藏的享樂了。　　我自懷孕之後，就抱了這樣的决心，平心靜氣來撫養我的孩子，哺乳，換尿布等等，一切煩勞工作，都由我自己來管理，雖然在開始時，日不得安。夜不得眠，覺得自己筋疲力倦，面容消瘦，但是我那時候不因此而痛心，發生一些厭惡情緒，祇把一切的家務雜事早點料理　了，可多抱　　我最可愛的孩子，從他那裏得到我的安慰，快樂眞可多着呢，那時我的親戚朋友沒有知道我的內心，都笑我吝嗇，不雇用奶媽，這樣的辛苦，要把自己的身體弄出毛病來呢。　　雇用奶媽撫着小孩子，在生理方面晚沒有像自己哺乳的適宜衛生，在道德方面更是不必講，一樣地都是人類，為什麼要奪人家的乳來喂養自己的小孩子，而自己却不盡一些母親的實任呢，進是我深深地反對的　　光陰過得眞快，我的小孩子已經四歲了，可是我現在用不着以前那樣辛苦了，不過我們的目標，要着重在他的教育問題上了，兒童的一顆純眞的小心，像是一張不經着色的潔白的紙，它可以變黑，也可以變赤，優劣如何，全仗為父母的加以引導，而且兒童富有模仿性，祇要我們誠心誠意地為人，隨時隨地的加以暗示，教成一個良好的好孩子，也不是一樁十分困難的事，我現在告訴一些關於我的孩子近况。　　我的孩子當他滿了八個月之後就斷乳了，這是育兒法裏所規定的，一經試行，確是很好，直到如今他的身體很強壯肥胖，從一週歲之後，他就開始會走了，這或許是環境的關係吧，現在他巳養成了愛好讀書的習慣，雖然我們家裏除了他沒有第二個孩子，可是他並不感覺到寂寞，因為他自有自己的園地，玩積木飛機汽車等等整天的不覺到疲倦，每天早上跟着他的爸爸，在陽台裏作柔軟體操，他那正確的姿勢，敏捷的動作，左右前後的方向，都十分的有勁，同時他的小嘴吧裏還哼着「一二三」的口令，這清晰微妙的喉音是何等的可愛！他而且唱着很好聽的歌曲，同時再會得舞蹈，道眞是一個活潑可愛的小孩子呀！本報特寫楊懿熙女士訪問記  萍寄　　婦女解放，問題在都市，而不在農村；　都是婦女，過分享樂，是生活的墜落！　　最近兩個月中，有幾位朋友談起楊懿熙女士，說她學識擾異，著述豐富，生於權貴之家，而持躬處世，忠信駕敬，實非平凡的女性，因此有人介紹我去訪問。我覺得像這樣的新女性，應該把她的思想，言行，描寫出來，一則表示鼓勵之意，再則作為一般女人的仿效。楊女士現任上海市政府英文秘書，那天我們談話的地點，便在市府的會客廳裏，差不多談了半小時，　出言莊重，層决分明，於修辭學頗有素養的。首先問妞家庭生活及求學時代的回憶，楊女士說：「我的家庭，說大不大，說小不小，姊妹六人，兄弟一人，但向來不住在一起的，醫如父親宦游武漢，一年只到上海一二次，和我們見面的機會很少。（按卽鄂省主席楊永泰氏）二妹最近赴英專攻醫學，三妹去年畢業滬江大學，現執教於嶺甫分校，眞是勞燕分飛，各理其業。我每天在市府服務，早出晚歸，在家時間也很少的。我先前肄業於金陵女大，後傳學滬江，一九三一年夏畢業。我在校的時候，最感興趣的，便是著述，金陵女大的校刊，差不各每期有我的作品，滬江的「天籟」校刋，我竟大膽地把所作文藝，小說之類，發表出來，現在想想，自己也覺得好笑。大概一個靑年，自信力一定很強，寫了文章，便喜歡公開發表，作品的成熟與否，那是另一間題；然而過於矜重，不肯輕易寫一個字的，究屬多數。　　「此外曾著述過整本的書麼？」　　「到現在為止，我寫過四部書：（一）莫斯科十年紀，（商務出版）（二）歐戰前十年問國際眞相之分析，最新出版，商務選作星期標準書；（三）未來世界，這本書應該早就出版的，因為裏面很多關於中日問題，商務方面為憐重計，遷延至今，大的年內可以發行；（四）「苦吻」，這一本是創作集，包含短篇與中篇的小說。「苦吻」兩個字，很像戀愛小說，然內容全是以社會問題為背景，描寫種種不幸的事跡，决不能當作戀愛小說看的。此書由良友出版，至多兩星期便可發行了　　「楊女士進市府有幾年了？對職務方面有何感想？」　　「我自出校後，會一度執教於暨南高中部，授政治經濟，一二八淞滬戰後，便進市府供職。我的職務，如普通英文書信及翻譯等，工作方面，很有興趣，市府內女職員共十餘人，各有專長，服務認眞，男女同人之間，非常恭敬，亦別的機關，往往有所謂「花瓶」之類的微號，惟獨市府，從無此種笑話，可見女子為社會服務，第一要學識，能內外應付，第二要能尊重自己的人格，自然人家就不會侵犯你的名舉了。」　　「都市裏一般女靑年，能否指示她們修養的方法？」　　「不敢當得很！我自己還是一個不知世故的靑年，正要人家來指導，怎能指示別人呢。不過依我平日的觀察，有幾點可以貢獻於女靑年的：（一）達爾文說：「物競天擇，適者生存。」這句話最有意味的。處今日的社會，非有專門學識，一定被淘汰的。希望我們女靑年，在求學時期，要認定某種學科，深切研究，至少有一二項特長，縐能為社會所應用。（二）自修學問，貴有系統，醫如研究自然科學的，那末她選擇課外書籍，都是自然科學一類的，着重一方面的研究，心思旣是一貫，功力纔能集中，進步一定迅速，否則東翻西檢，結果必一無所成。（三）學生時代的團體生活，應注重思想與智識的交換，聠絡感情，還在其次，但不能盲從，作非法的政治活動。（四）中產以上的女子，往往不肯用功，自以為有父母作靠山，這是最腐化的思想，家庭境遇好的，正是她可以上進的機會，怎能把機會輕輕放過呢？倘如你能以餘力來補助貧寒的女子，共同前進，這更是功德無量的事。（五）一般女生，平日不看報紙，對於國際動態，國內大勢，以及社會問題，都茫然不知；一出學校，一切都是隔膜，這是大大的缺點！報紙是世界一切間題的縮影，女靑年在正課之外，是應該仔細觀察的。」　　「對於婦女解放，有何意見？」　　「婦女解放，是事實問題，法律上雖賦予男女平等的機會，然而表面一紙空文，於婦女本身有何利益？我主張女子要能實幹，與男子一樣的苦幹；例如蘇聯婦女，能參加政治，社會實際的工作，自然不必苦苦要求，卽享平等的權利。中國婦女解放問題倒不在農村，而在都市。大小都市裏資產階級的婦女，物質享受，過分奢侈的，實在是墜落的生活，反而降低了自已的地位，這些話，想來不太武斷吧！」楊懿熙女士蕙姊（上）　　在個太陽快要把底層融化的夏日的中午，錫生穿着一身打了許多補釘，顏色黃得像初出幹的糙米　樣的夏布衫褲，馱着一個斗大的包裹從鄉下進城來了。他今年已是十七歲了，但模樣兒還是很瘦小，看上去只像十二三歲的小孩子；倒也不能怪他自己，因為他家裏實在是太窮苦了，從小營養不足，所以發育也特別的慢。自從六年前他媽媽死了之後，更沒有人肯去照顧他了，雖然他叔叔還勉強允許他一天吃三碗麥粞飯，晚上佔一個床舖，但衣服髒了也沒人替他取去洗，有什麼病痛也沒人給他藥吃，因此就讓他變成了一個又黃又瘦的癆病鬼，誰見了都要說聲「這孩子怪可憐」！　　這一年，天多下了幾塲雨，在一向不甚注意水利的中國，便無可避免的讓成了一塲大水災，C鎭雖不曾給水冲掉，但田裏的農作物已全部斷送了；為着這個緣故，錫生得叔叔便嚴重地聲明不能再繼續扶養錫生了。那末錫生應該怎樣維持生活呢？他叔叔倒也並不模糊，居然還給他指點一了一條生路——就是教他去投奔他的姊姊——蕙。　　蕙是錫生得胞姊，比他長十一歲，在七年前已出嫁了；可是據錫生知道（他叔叔也知道）他得姊夫因為妻子家裏太窮，恐怕坍他自己的台，所以和錫生家向不來往，連他母親死的那一天，蕙姊和姊夫也不曾來，只送了兩塊錢。……像這樣的一家親戚，肯不肯收留錫生呢？雖然錫生沒有多大知識，也覺得這條路有些走不通。而且他還記得小時候跟蕙姊搶浜瓜吃，兩個人常常打架，現在找伊，伊一定肯招留嗎？　　錫生心上的為難，他叔叔是决不管他的，挨到了這一天，，便像「送」似的把他一陣風趕了出來；錫生看他叔叔滿臉起了橫肉，也知道家裏是不能再留了，便硬着頭皮，在烈日下一步一步的走進城去。城裏的路錫生很不熟，問了許多的訊，才找到了陳家的門口。陳家屋子眞不小，前後三進，鍚生最初是被招待在二牆門口站着，候了好半嚮，他姊夫——陳二少爺才慢吞吞地踱將出來，見了錫生，也不招待呼進大廳去坐，儘用兩道可怕的目光向他濕身上下打量着，半嚮，才像對付呌化子似的喝道：　　「你來幹什麽」？</p>

<p>Page 19</p>
<p>申報本埠增刊談言文化侵略  夢若　　「友邦」之侵略我國，是多方面的，政治，軍事，經濟，文化，莫不相機積極進行。政治及軍事的政策，已收相當的效果了，經濟則正在「提携」中。至若文化一項，近來也頗注意。他們一會計劃在上海設立圖書館，一會倡議在北平創辦試騐塲。總之，凡可以「宣揚」文化的地方，就想法下手。　　最近「友邦」又有在我國各地開設學校的傳說了。南方台督府决在厦門設立五年制甲種商業學校，收日台靑年之志向南華南洋活躍的，授以中國文，並再收中國學生。北方有旅平台民某，聯絡某方文化團體，及中國一部份學術界人士，擬在當地籌辦一中日大學，其開辦費及基金，將以「友邦未退還我國的庚欵撥用。　　這顯在是一種文化侵略。近來「友邦」方在大喊「北寗南進」，在厦門開辦商業學校，便是「南進」的準備。他們為實行南進政策起見，極力鼓勵台人移殖南華。現在再訓練一批志向南華南洋活躍的「先鋒隊」，侵略的力量，就更加增大了。「友邦」在上海曾設立一所商業學校，許多畢業生，盡給派到我國內地，去實地調查社會經濟各狀况。厦門的商業學校，無疑也負有同樣的使命的。　　北平的中日大學，在今日應運而生，更值得注意。邇來我國學生之到「友邦」留學的，人數日多。在這許多留學生中，志在求學的，一定不少。但別有用心的，當不能說沒有。他們看穿了這一點，索性在中國創立一大學，一方藉以「宜揚」文化，一方也可以「製造幾個「日本通」，替他們効忠。一舉兩得，何樂而不為？　　還有更「好」的消息，「友邦」的文化工作，不但着眼在智識份子，也將惠及平民了。先日外務省召開會議，討論對華文化事業，以從來偏重在學術方面，與中國民衆，絕少接觸的機會，因之未能得到充分的效果，於是决在濟南及天津，設立產業研究所。這是與經濟政策，相輔而行的。他們近頃對我北方，注重經濟的開發。產業研究所的創辦，就是要指導農民，改良產業。這方面的努力，實比學術有利得多。無怪一班「友邦」要人，常發出安定華北農民生活的高論。　　文化侵略，是這般厲害的，我們要用何方法抵制呢？老婦人的故事  休羊　　晚飯後，這塊方塲上是大衆納凉閑談的好地方。　　鄉下人家晚餐沒有在日落之後的，晚霞像燈綵一樣在天空張掛着，老榆樹頂上拂來的晚風使人蘇醒一天來工作的疲勞。幾個喜歡喝一盅的莊稼入臨時凑集着一點殘餘的菜餚，毫無拘束地園在塲的一角。田裏隨了晚風送來一陣陣的稻香，他們已經盼望着今年的豐收了。　　一些從城裏茶館裏聽來的新聞，長納凉的好材料。一個簡單的故事，十天半個月前的新聞報上的傳說，他們很高與地談論着，一天繼續着一天漸漸地蛻變做一個神怪的故事，甚至開始提講這故事的人也有纏不淸來源和結果了。鄕下人的歲月在沒有秋收以前都是充滿着喜悅的。　　今年這方塲上多了個善講故事的老婦人。據她說她的家鄕是遠在數百里外的×省，為了尊訪兒子流落到這鎭上來。一個外鄉口音的人出現在這鈸上的時侯，每决有一度莫明其妙的謠傳，這老</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>婦人住下來時，就有人傳出是什麼黨派來作探子的，她探聽了這鎮上的虛實，什麼黨馬上就要來刦鎭。這個謠傳確使鎭上人十分恐慌，他們不怕刦鈸，他們都是窮光蛋，不過他們每個人都有一團希望寄托在他們辛勤耕種着的田畝上。在沒有收獲的時候，他們不願放棄了逃性命，如果剛是打麥的時侯，他們又怎樣能帶着這些心血的財產逃命呢？於是有些膽量大的婦人家和那老婦人打交道了。老婦人每天在家裏紡紗，她為人很和氣，她是一個歷盡人世的老婦入，她常常替年輕的入解决許多困難的事；她善講故事更使全鎭的人接近起來。在老婦人知道她住到鎭上來被人看做一件秘密的時侯，她便講起自己的故事來。　　——她的家鄕是在長江之北的，十五歲上嫁了丈夫，因為在窮苦的人家是不肯把女兒多養着分利的。她丈夫是在北五省販賣各種藥材的，一年難得有一個月住在家裏，但是她們夫婦的感情很好。在她二十歲上生了個兒子，頭胎生兒子是大喜事，她丈夫那年為了生兒子竟是半年多沒有出門去做生意。在那時侯常有人到她家裏來和她丈夫鬧事，那些人都是丈夫的同伴。　　有一天，天色剛剛微明的時候，他們來挾着她的丈夫到外面去了。到牙牌時有人來告訴她丈夫三里外的池塘邊被人砍了。這是一個晴天霹靂，她抱了幾個月的孩子跑到那邊去哭着，她又跑到地方官那裏去要求緝兇。這殺人案在三年後破案了，原來她的丈夫和那一夥人在北五省做着一種秘密的賣買，生了兒子她住在家裏半年，同伴們以為他要歇手對於他們是不利的要把他砍了。　　死了丈夫後的老婦人，她抱了三歲的孩了到處流落，她做乞丐，做傭婦，做女工，什麼女人家的下等工作她做過，她把兒子扶養長大。　　但是在一個內戰開始的時候，她正在火綫內做織襪女工，她的兒子被抓去了。到戰事結束，她的兒子沒有回來。她曾費了十年多的時光，在北方每一省每一縣探訪下落，卽使她能够見到兒子的屍骨。在那時期內她忍受着更苦的生活，和各種侮辱。　　現在北方已經像另外一個世界了，受了五十多年苦難的她，再不願意看到那種殘忍的屠殺了，她一路南來，到了這鎭上。　　這故事引動了鎭上人的同情，他們也都是從苦難的日子中長大起來的，他們也有遭到老婦人同樣的命運，他們已微微戚到他們的希望已經落空了，種田不再是他們的終生職業……老婦人的故事，使他們的意志漸漸游離起來了。湖畔寄語  旅岡　　近來常常喜歡午睡，也許是生活使我感到太疲勞的原故吧？每天從老遠的地方跑回來，就這末的消磨了一個午後。你說：「努力點吧！懶是該挨打的。」然而我不管怎樣下决心去「努力」，結果還是一樣沒出息，我有時雖很嚴厲地責怪自己；但有時冷靜地想來，却又感到周圍的環境的確太使我不能寗靜了。………　　我很想逸脫這樣的氛圍，但是事實上沒有方法使我能够這樣做。所以有時我反而來了一種幽閒的情緒，在窗前看了黃昏的霞彩。這幾矢來，黃昏的天色確是很美麗，我偶爾也想起了在車廂里所看到的那黃昏的遠景。……這種情緒也許是一種反常的吧，然而我倒覺得頗有一點「忙里偷閑」的威覺……我終日和一種矛盾的心理戰鬭。因之，也常常想起你所說的那種兩重性格」：「一面是天眞，活潑，熱情，愉快，柔順……一面却又是絕對不同的憂鬱，傷感，沉靜，冷酷，崛强，……」我覺得一個人的一生也正就是不斷的在這種矛盾之間搏戰。所以，無怪乎也有人把一個人疑天所養生的性格，歸咎於環境。　　近來的生活環境本來就有點暗晦，我們自己越感到苦惱，環境也就越發感到不「明朗」。有時我也有一種像你那樣的癖性，歡喜孤獨地靜坐和緘默不言。所以那决你病了，在信上說了這樣的話：「……我總歡喜獨自呆在靜寂的，幽暗的庭園里，不動也不響。我常常想跑到山上或海邊去盡情的痛哭，或者就此葬身在雄壯的海里，不然就粉身碎骨在深淵中……，」這話非常使我感動，而且引起了我的同感。我們說過在某一時期過後我們到海灘去，看看那浩渺，海景，然而我們一直到此刻還沒有了結這件事。我們在陰沉的環境中，在忙亂的生活中一天一天捱着下去。——個靑年的人，在這種「老氣橫秋」的氛園里，怎麼能够消磨下去呢？　　一個人有時非常之矛盾，一年之前，我靜寂地住在一個熱鬧的市區里，心里感到異常空虛，我沒有法子消磨了這樣長的時日，我把一部極寶貴的書從頭到尾看了七八回。現在，我整天是這樣的忙碌，連看書的機會都沒有了，我依舊是覺得異常空虛。　　有人談起了托爾斯太的那種超乎常人的性癖和熱情，我不很同意這個人的話。我緘默着。我想起了我們再三爭論的把托爾斯太底那段話；我現在得到了一個新的解釋，那就是一種最尊貴的對人的熟情。……這也許你不會再和我固執與爭辯。自然，這爭辯不是沒有意義的。我常常害怕熱情會損害了理智。所以我畢竟總是同意你說的那個意見：情感不應該隨便放射，而是應該有所克制的。　　熱情的衝動，常常會把一個有用的人燒殺，它是一盆火，在不可收拾的時候是會關禍的。　　往往熱情在對工作的推動上是一個很大的動力，然而只有在抱着純潔的事業心時才有可能。然而，現在，我們雖然對自己所忠心的事業還沒有灰冷，我們還有着靑春的熱力和信心；可是在這種陰霉的景况之下，我却感到有點難耐的疲勞了。　　我相信你會疑心我是病，假如眞的是病，那倒沒有什麼，因為我常常忘懷了自己的軀體。正如在羣衆的塲合中我忘記了我的個體一樣。但是實際上，在我這樣的體格看來，無論如何决不會沒有病微的。我覺得，只要這疲勞的心緒，能够在明朗的天空吐一口氣息就够了</p>

Two years ago, he went to the Soviet Union to investigate the political system and economic construction, and all his gains and good impressions of the people there are still unforgettable.

<h3>On the Unfortunate Incident in Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>All people who love peace in both China and Japan feel deeply regret for the Chengdu incident that occurred on the 24th of this month, because this incident has given a great stimulus to national sentiment, and the development of this stimulus may be harmful to the peace of East Asia.</p>
<p>We are still unable to fully understand the root cause of this unfortunate incident, but the following two conclusions can be drawn simply from the various news that is already known:</p>
<p>First, among those who sacrificed their lives in this unexpected incident, in addition to our country's people and military police, were Watanabe, a reporter for the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, and Fukagawa, a reporter for the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun. Both Japanese reporters were dispatched by their newspapers to serve as correspondents. This time, they were killed by rioters for no reason in the interior of our country. In any case, the rational people in our country cannot help but feel deep sympathy. From the perspective of a great nation, we should cherish any foreigner who engages in a peaceful occupation as much as our own compatriots. Therefore, we not only mourn from the bottom of our hearts for the two Japanese who were engaged in peaceful work, but after this incident, we have become more aware of the importance of promoting the spirit of universal love and the danger of shallow nationalists shooting indiscriminately in mass movements.</p>
<p>Second, the administrative authorities of the central government and various provinces have done their best in recent years to protect foreign nationals, especially Japanese nationals. The increase in the number of Japanese nationals in our country and the strong sales of Japanese goods in recent years are obvious evidence. However, unexpected violent incidents cannot be avoided even in politically clear Japan, let alone in our country, which is deeply burdened by national disasters. The occurrence of the Chengdu incident can be said to be due to the local authorities' negligence in prevention, but analyzing the excessive emotions of the rioters, it is indeed somewhat due to the evil consequences planted by Japanese soldiers in the past five years. From this point of view, it is clear that only by adjusting Sino-Japanese relations on the condition of absolutely respecting our country's independence and sovereignty can similar unfortunate incidents be prevented from happening again in the future.</p>
<p>We hope that those in China and Japan who truly want to maintain peace in East Asia will use calm reason to consider this unfortunate incident.</p>
<h3>Chengdu Incident: China and Japan Send Personnel to Investigate; Japanese Consul in Chongqing Ordered to Fly to Chengdu; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Also Sends Commissioners; Military Police Closely Protect Japanese Nationals</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to understand the truth about the Chengdu incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Commissioners Yang Kaijia and Section Chief Shao Yulin to investigate. Yang and Shao flew directly to Chengdu on the China Aviation Corporation Douglas 24 aircraft at 8 a.m. on the 28th. Matsumura, a third secretary from the Japanese Embassy who was sent to investigate the truth, also flew to Chengdu via Nanjing on the 28th. Wu Zexiang, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Sichuan and Kangding, telegraphed Nanjing on the 28th to report on the investigation and handling process. As for the aftermath of the deceased Japanese, China and Japan are handling it together. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Commissioners Yang Kaijia and Section Chief Shao Yulin flew from Nanjing to Chongqing and then to Chengdu via Hankou on the Nanjing postal plane at 10:30 a.m. on the 28th to investigate the truth of the Chengdu incident. Accompanying them were two reporters, Nakamura, a Shanghai-based correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun, and others. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Special Commissioner Wu Zexiang of Sichuan and Kangding telegraphed the ministry on the 28th, reporting that in addition to sending condolences to the families of the two Japanese reporters who were killed, the injured were treated by the local government, and the truth of the civil unrest and riots will be investigated by the military and political authorities. In the meantime, military police will closely protect Japanese nationals. Both China and Japan are currently sending personnel to investigate the truth. It is expected that after the investigation, both sides will only deal with it as a disturbance by local rioters and will not affect Sino-Japanese relations because of this, so the situation will not escalate. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a concluding report on the Chengdu incident at today's cabinet meeting, stating that countermeasures for the Chengdu incident must be decided after receiving accurate and complete information from local investigators. Arita believes that in addition to the usual demands for punishing murderers and compensating for losses, it is necessary to take fundamental steps. The cabinet then followed Arita's conclusion and decided to leave the decision of the steps to the three ministers. After the cabinet meeting adjourned, the three ministers of Foreign Affairs, War, and Navy continued to meet. Arita immediately expressed his opinion, saying that the Chengdu incident should not be regarded as a local problem, but should be handled by the governments of China and Japan. The authorities of the two countries should investigate the cause and fundamentally resolve it. Afterwards, a thorough discussion was held on the specific plans and active actions to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, which lasted for an hour. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told foreign news reporters this afternoon that since the Chengdu incident, China has been filled with anti-Japanese sentiment, like a gas that is easily ignited and can explode once ignited. Therefore, Japan's most urgent need is to eliminate this gas. The Chinese and Japanese authorities should urgently consider the proper methods to implement this urgent task. When asked whether the Sino-Japanese incident was caused by the recent anti-Japanese sentiment prevalent among the Chinese or the result of Chinese dissatisfaction with Japan, the spokesman hesitated and replied that he did not know. Looking at the general situation, most newspapers described the Chengdu incident with stimulating and indignant words, and all parties hoped that the incident would be resolved quickly so that the future negotiations between China and Japan would not be hampered.

<h3>Injured Japanese Nationals Gradually Recover; Seto Details the Course of the Riot; Tanaka Issues a Written Statement</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) Three people, including Shibo Kakuro, a member of the Japanese Consulate in Chongqing, and a Japanese doctor, flew to Chengdu from Chongqing on the 26th. In the evening, they went to the military hospital of the governor's office to visit the Japanese nationals Takeo Tanaka and Naoshi Seto, who were injured in the Chengdu riot on the 24th. According to Shibo, who spoke to a news reporter who visited him at 11 a.m. on the 27th, after we arrived in Chengdu, we went to comfort our injured compatriots, Takeo Tanaka and Naoshi Seto. Tanaka's injuries were minor and he has gradually recovered. Seto's head is slightly feverish, and he will recover if he rests again. Tanaka can already write with a pen, and Seto is in good spirits. He can still remember the details of the unfortunate incident and described the situation at that time in a loud voice. He said that at 3 p.m. on the 24th, someone came to the Da Chuan Hotel to inquire about their mission in Chengdu. They replied that they were merchants and news reporters, and that they were all traveling for leisure and had nothing to do with the establishment of a consulate. After hearing this answer, everyone left without any other changes. Seto also said that at about 5 p.m., when they were resting on the second floor of the hotel, suddenly tens of thousands of people gathered inside and outside the Da Chuan Hotel, and the noise was deafening. Then they heard the sound of windows and glass breaking, and they knew that the Da Chuan Hotel had been destroyed by rioters. At that time, the military police stationed at the Da Chuan Hotel to protect them were weak and unable to stop the rioters. The military police escorted the four of them to the third floor for protection. Not long after they went upstairs, the rioters swarmed to the third floor and destroyed all the items in the building, causing great chaos. Seto continued to say that in this chaotic situation, they were pushed out of the hotel by the rioters and bumped around in the crowd on the street. The rioters gathered more and more people, and the four of them and the protecting military police were dispersed and unable to take care of each other. Seto concluded that after this disturbance, his nerves were dizzy, and later he learned that he was escorted to the hospital by the police. According to Tanaka, after being dispersed, when he was unable to escape from the crowd, he was suddenly held by a stout gentleman, and he struggled to escape. Later, he learned that this gentleman was the director of the Public Security Bureau. He expressed his gratitude for Fan's efforts to save his life. The bodies of the two deceased Japanese, Watanabe and Fukagawa, have been inspected by personnel from the Japanese Embassy and the Japanese Consul, and it has now been decided to cremate them in Chengdu. The two injured Japanese have requested to fly to Shanghai on the morning of the 29th, but have not yet been granted permission by the doctor, as they are afraid that they will not be able to withstand the long journey, which may affect their injuries. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Tanaka, an employee of the South Manchuria Railway Company who survived the attack by rioters, was found to be in serious condition after the investigation, and he is still not out of danger. Although Seto's injuries were serious, fortunately, he did not suffer any vital injuries, and his life can be saved. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Takeo Tanaka, a Japanese national injured in the Chengdu case, gave a written statement to the Central News Agency reporter in Japanese on the 28th, describing the details of the Chengdu case, which is very detailed. The following is a summary of a few points: (1) During the disturbance, he showed his passport, and someone immediately stood up to speak. This speech was successful, and the crowd withdrew. (2) When the crowd attacked for the second time, the room was dark, and several members of the Public Security Bureau protected us and worked hard to defend us, but they were unable to succeed due to the disparity in numbers. (3) We were dragged into the street by the crowd, and we were grateful to Director Fan for stopping the crowd, so that my life could be saved. I express my gratitude for Director Fan's efforts. After the bodies of the two deceased Japanese, Watanabe and Fukagawa, were inspected by personnel from the Japanese Embassy and the Japanese Consul, it has now been decided to cremate them in Chengdu. The two injured Japanese have requested to fly to Shanghai on the morning of the 29th, but have not yet been granted permission by the doctor, as they are afraid that they will not be able to withstand the long journey, which may affect their injuries.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, the Guangxi troops under Zhou Zuhuang occupied Lianjiang on the evening of the 25th of this month, and their vanguard is advancing rapidly. Fierce fighting is currently taking place around Hepu. Furthermore, Weng Zhaoyuan's troops launched an attack on Lingshan on the 26th and are currently in a stalemate with the Guangdong troops stationed there. It is reported that Li Bai's attitude has suddenly become more assertive, and the reasons are complex. His previous expression of peace was merely a delaying tactic, and he has been secretly and actively making military arrangements. It has now been decided to advance south in three routes. The first route is attacking Luoding from Cenxi, the second route is attacking Fengchuan and Deqing from Wuzhou, and the vanguard of this route has reportedly had contact in the past two days. The third route is attacking Guangning and Sihui from Huaiji. The clouds of war are thick over western Guangdong, and the situation is extremely serious.

<p>(Hong Kong) The atmosphere for peace in Guangxi has recently seemed to become stronger, but according to well-informed sources, there is still no complete agreement between the Central Government and Li Bai, and there are still many obstacles to a peaceful resolution. Li Bai's proposal to hold a meeting in Wuzhou is practically impossible to realize. It is rumored that Wang Chonghui came south at Chiang's request to mediate the Guangxi situation, and may go to Guangxi in the next few days. It is generally believed that Wang's visit to Guangxi this time is the last attempt at a peaceful mediation. (28th China Union Dispatch)</p>

<h3>After Summer Recess, Legislative Yuan's Regular Meeting Resumes Yesterday; Passes the Sichuan Construction and Old Debt Exchange Public Bond Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 69th meeting on the morning of the 28th, with 50 members including Chuan Bingchang attending. Sun Ke chaired, and Liang Hancao was the secretary-general. The "Regulations for the Sichuan Provincial Construction and Old Debt Exchange Public Bonds of the Republic of China Year 25" were passed. During the initial review of the regulations, Chen Changheng gave a detailed report on the purpose of issuing the public bonds, stating that the Sichuan Provincial Government originally planned to issue 45 million yuan of construction public bonds, and the central government approved the issuance of 30 million yuan first, and the rest would be issued when necessary. In addition to handling transportation and production construction projects, the public bonds must also be used to exchange old debts to balance income and expenditure, so the title of the regulations was changed to "Construction and Old Debt Exchange Public Bonds" to conform to the facts of 30 million yuan. According to Liu Hangchen, the director of the Sichuan Department of Finance, the detailed purpose is to allocate as follows: (1) 13 million yuan for transportation projects, including 8.5 million yuan for building the Chengdu-Chongqing section of the Sichuan-Han Railway and 4.5 million yuan for building the Sichuan-Yunnan and other highways; (2) 7 million yuan for production construction, including 2.5 million yuan for the share capital of the rural cooperative treasury, 250,000 yuan for the opening expenses of a vegetable oil factory to improve tung oil production, 500,000 yuan for silk industry improvement expenses, 1.75 million yuan for sugar industry improvement expenses, 1 million yuan for paper mill opening expenses, 300,000 yuan for alkali factory opening expenses, and 700,000 yuan for the opening expenses of three hydropower plants; (3) 10 million yuan for exchanging old debts. In the past, the Sichuan Provincial Government had borrowed more than 10 million yuan from the business community for bandit suppression and military needs during emergencies and had given short-term loan certificates with a tax rate of 1%. Now, exchanging the debts with public bonds can not only consolidate the credit of the loans but also reduce the burden on the provincial treasury because the interest rate is changed to 6%. After the speech, the case was passed without objection. Also, this meeting was the first Yuan meeting after the summer vacation. The members had been apart for more than a month during the summer vacation, and they greeted each other when they arrived at the meeting, and the situation was extremely harmonious.

However, after ten years have passed, if both parties are willing, they can negotiate to amend the current treaty at any time. Any amendment must stipulate that the alliance should continue in accordance with the principles contained in the current treaty.</p>
<p>Scope of Alliance: The treaty stipulates the scope of the alliance as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Neither party shall adopt an attitude or conclude a treaty that conflicts with the alliance. (2) If the United Kingdom and Egypt encounter any dispute with a third country that may lead to a break with that country, the two countries intend to consult to seek a peaceful resolution. (3) If the United Kingdom or Egypt engages in war, the other country will come out to assist it in the capacity of an alliance. All obligations are based on the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Paris Convention.</p>
<p>Military Mutual Assistance: The treaty pre-specifies the ways in which Egypt will assist as follows: In the event of an impending war, a threat of war, or a discernible international emergency, Egypt will provide the United Kingdom with all kinds of facilities within its power. This facility and this kind of assistance includes (1) the use of Egyptian ports, airfields, transportation, and all necessary administrative and legal plans, (2) the promulgation of martial law and the implementation of effective inspections, and (3) the convenience of dispatching British troops or reinforcements, etc.</p>
<p>Canal Defense: Regarding the protection of the Suez Canal, the treaty states that "The Suez Canal is an integral part of Egypt, but it is also a universal transportation route and a major transportation route for all parts of the British Empire. In order to cooperate with the Egyptian army to defend the canal, Egypt shall permit the United Kingdom to maintain an army of no more than 10,000 men and an air force of no more than 400 pilots in the canal area until the United Kingdom and Egypt mutually agree that the Egyptian army can, by its own means, surround the canal and ensure its proper and complete security. However, this garrison can be increased in times of war or threat of war and discernible international emergencies. At the expiration of the current treaty, the question of whether the Egyptian army is capable of ensuring the security of the canal shall be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant implemented last month, or other persons or groups agreed upon by the United Kingdom and Egypt for arbitration if the two parties cannot agree. The Egyptian government agrees to build barracks in the canal area to house the British troops reaching the aforementioned number and to provide sufficient comfort and emergency water sources according to the needs of the British government. The Egyptian government also agrees to build roads, the most important of which is from the canal area across the Nile Delta to Alexandria, and from the canal area to Egyptian capital Cairo. The Egyptian authorities will also improve the railway facilities in the canal area. Once these works have been fully implemented to the satisfaction of both parties, all British troops stationed in Egypt, except those originally stationed in the canal, will be withdrawn to the canal area. This provision refers to the British troops in Cairo, Abassia and Hilmiyya, as well as the British troops stationed in Heliopolis, Shiroan, and Abu Qir, but the troops in the port of Alexandria are an exception and will retain their current status for a period of eight years, as both parties believe that the new barracks in the canal area will not be fully completed until then, and the improvement work on the roads and railways will not be completed until then.</p>
<p>Air Force Training: The new treaty also contains other military provisions as follows: (1) The British Air Force may fly anywhere with the permission of the Egyptian side for training, but the Egyptian Air Force may also fly freely over British territory to show reciprocal treatment. (2) In Egyptian territory and territorial waters, suitable landing sites and seaplane berthing facilities will be prepared for the use of the British Air Force. If the British authorities deem it necessary to add additional facilities, they must also do so. (3) Although the British personnel currently in the Egyptian army will be withdrawn, the Egyptian government should adopt the advice of the British military inspection team for the benefit of the alliance between the two parties so that the training of the Egyptian army and air force can be improved. (4) The British government will set up appropriate training institutions in its own country to allow Egypt to send its soldiers and others to receive new military training. (5) The armament equipment of the Egyptian army must be the same as that of the British army and must not be different from each other.</p>
<p>Extraterritoriality: The final section of the treaty contains clauses on the safety of foreigners, the status of foreign officials, and the surrender treaty on consular jurisdiction. The original text is as follows: "The British government recognizes that the Egyptian government is responsible for protecting the lives and property of foreigners traveling to Egypt, so the Egyptian government must faithfully fulfill this obligation. The police bureau in Egypt will be abolished immediately after the treaty is approved, but within the last five years, European personnel must still be retained in the police agencies of various cities in Egypt. During this period, the Egyptian police will still be led by British officers. The British government recognizes that, in accordance with the spirit of the times and the current situation in Egypt, various surrender provisions should no longer exist, so it intends to assist Egypt in contacting various countries that enjoy consular jurisdiction and other surrender rights so that they can negotiate an appropriate solution to each other on the following points: (1) Find a way to eliminate the restrictions on sovereignty when Egypt implements its legislative power. (2) Negotiate a transitional approach and stipulate an appropriate time limit, during which the Mixed Court will be temporarily retained. In addition to its original jurisdiction, it will also be granted the powers of the current consular court, and when this transitional period ends, the Mixed Court will be abolished. The legislation of the Egyptian government for foreigners must comply with the principles of modern law and must not discriminate against foreigners."</p>
<p>Accession to the League of Nations: The treaty also stipulates that the United Kingdom and Egypt will send ambassadors to each other, and the British government will assist Egypt in requesting to join the League of Nations as a member state. It also states that the rights and obligations of the United Kingdom and Egypt in the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Paris Convention are not affected by this article. If any objections arise regarding the implementation or interpretation of the various articles of this treaty that cannot be resolved through direct negotiations, they shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the League of Nations.

<h3>British Newspapers' Editorials Celebrate, Deeming it a Victory for British Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, most of the London morning newspapers published editorials expressing warm congratulations to those involved in the negotiation of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. Only the Daily Mail and the Morning Post offered some criticism. The Times stated that the significance of this treaty is extremely clear and needs no further praise. For the past eighteen years, Britain and Egypt have coexisted in a state of unease, inequality, and instability. Now, this has transformed into a friendly alliance between two equal and independent sovereign states. We should naturally congratulate the two governments and their representatives for this diplomatic victory, it said. The Evening Standard commented that the satisfactory outcome of this treaty was quite beyond the expectations of most people. The speed and appropriateness with which the representatives of both countries negotiated this matter deserve celebration, it said. The Daily News believed that the public opinion of both countries could now put the unpleasant past behind them and would undoubtedly rejoice exceedingly, it said. The Daily Telegraph also stated that this treaty was nothing less than an alliance between two free nations, it said. However, the Daily Mail believed that this would strike a blow to the security of the entire Empire. The Morning Post also said, "Our worst fears have now been confirmed. The conclusion of this treaty is not the end of disputes between the two countries, but rather the beginning," it said. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of War, Mr. Dern, Passes Away</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of War, Mr. Dern, aged sixty-four, had been ill for over a month. He passed away today at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington. Mr. Dern initially suffered from influenza. After being admitted to the hospital, he developed heart disease. Upon hearing the news, Washington officials immediately expressed their sorrow. All U.S. Army camps lowered their flags to half-mast in mourning. It was also decided to fire a salute every half hour tomorrow morning and, after the sounding of the retreat bugle in the evening, to fire a nineteen-gun salute in tribute. Until President Roosevelt appoints a new Secretary of War, the current Under Secretary, Mr. Woodring, will temporarily take charge of the department's affairs. The most promising candidates for the position are Governor McNutt of Indiana and former High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Murphy. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Bismarck, North Dakota U.S. President Roosevelt, who is currently traveling through drought-stricken areas, announced after hearing the news of Secretary of War Dern's death in Washington, "With Mr. Dern's passing, the American people have lost a loyal, talented, and honest public servant. The entire U.S. Army has lost a capable leader," he said. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of Mr. Dern The late U.S. Secretary of War, Mr. Dern, was born on September 8, 1872, in Dodge County, Nebraska, USA. After reaching adulthood, he entered the University of Nebraska. He was fond of sports and excelled at football. After graduating, he married Miss Blanc. They had seven children. Mr. Dern's parents, driven by financial hardship, moved from Nebraska to Utah to make a living. Mr. Dern also had to discontinue his studies and engage in business to support himself. His first job was as a bookkeeper at the Mercur Gold Mining Company. Because the work was simple, he devoted his spare time to studying metallurgy and engineering. Sixteen years later, the company merged with other gold mines. Seeing Mr. Dern's great potential, the directors promoted him to assistant manager and treasurer. A year later, he was promoted again to general manager, a position he held until the mine closed in 1913. Mr. Dern gained prominence in American politics after being elected as a Senator for Utah. Because of his competence and initiative, he was highly valued by President Roosevelt, who entrusted him with the important responsibility of leading the U.S. Army. His untimely death from heart disease is truly a misfortune for the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>At the Pacific Conference, The Issue of Military Deployments in the Far East Russian and Japanese Representatives Engage in Fierce Debate, Japan Insists on Revising the Nine-Power Treaty, Refuses to Submit to the Hague Court for Interpretation</p>
<p>Yosemite The Pacific Institute continued its roundtable conference today. Heated debate erupted between the Japanese and Russian representatives. The Japanese representative demanded that the Soviet Russian representative explain whether the number of Soviet troops stationed in the Far East exceeded the total number of Japanese troops. The Soviet Russian representative admitted that this claim was not without basis but stated that he did not know the exact figures and would try to find out before reporting to the conference. Both representatives insisted that their respective countries' military strength was purely for defensive purposes. A British representative today proposed that Pacific nations establish a regional security pact with military and economic sanctions, similar to the proposal made yesterday by former French Prime Minister Sarraut. However, other British representatives did not support this proposal. The roundtable conference also determined that the only weapon of the League of Nations for maintaining peace is economic sanctions, which should be implemented swiftly by all countries to be effective. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Yosemite The Japanese representative to the Pacific Institute today refused to submit the Nine-Power Treaty to the International Court of Justice at The Hague for interpretation, stating that no country in the world would be willing to submit issues related to its national lifeline to any court for adjudication. He insisted on convening a special conference to revise the treaty, claiming that since the Nine-Power Treaty was established, the only provision that had been implemented was the abolition of foreign post offices in China, which undermined the Chinese postal system. The reduction of the Chinese army had not been implemented, and foreign powers had not yet gradually relinquished their concessions. Since the rise of Soviet Russia, many new problems had arisen in the Pacific region that could not have been foreseen when the Nine-Power Treaty was signed. It is now necessary to convene a special conference to study these issues in detail, he said. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>New Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Shigemitsu, Speaks of his Aspirations, Striving to Adjust Relations Between the Two Countries in a Spirit of Non-Aggression and Non-Threat</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Shigemitsu Aoi, who had been recuperating in the Aharahara area, was officially appointed as the Ambassador to Russia by the government on the 27th. On the morning of the 28th, at 11:00 AM, he returned to Tokyo to meet with Foreign Minister Arita and receive the official credentials of the appointed ambassador. In the afternoon of the 27th, at his villa in Aharahara, Mr. Shigemitsu spoke to reporters about his aspirations, stating that Japan's policy towards Russia was of great importance. Japan's continental policy is based on its policies towards China and Russia. Therefore, Japan-Russia relations are a matter of great concern for the Japanese national life. I have always believed that diplomacy with Russia is an important issue, and I have constantly promoted its importance to various sectors of society. I also believe that the government has a definite policy towards Soviet Russia, which, as Foreign Minister Arita stated in his speech to the Diet, is based on the spirit of non-threat and non-aggression. However, since Soviet Russia has expanded its military deployment in the Far East, Japan has also had to expand its military capabilities to counter it. The opinions of some people in the country are entirely in favor of a non-aggression treaty, but it is doubtful whether the timing is right now. In short, the key to the policy towards Russia lies in how to implement the nationally agreed policy consistently in all aspects. However, the key to opening up Japan-Russia diplomacy is for the Japanese people to pay attention to Soviet affairs and study its various issues, which is most necessary. Deepening the Japanese public's understanding of the Soviet Union will naturally lead to an opportunity to resolve various problems. It is reported that after Ambassador Shigemitsu exchanges opinions with the Foreign Ministry and the Army and Navy authorities, he will travel to Manchuria in late September to investigate the border situation. He is expected to officially take office in November. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Border Clashes Occur Frequently, Japan and Russia Exchange Protests, The Potapovka Incident, Russia Announces the Truth</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to reports from Khabarovsk, on the 26th of this month, a team of Soviet border guards in the Potapovka area on the Soviet-Manchurian border was watering their horses by the Ussuri River when they were suddenly fired upon by the "Manchurian" side. The incident occurred at 2:45 PM. Border guards at the Potapovka station were leading their horses to the river to drink when they were bombarded with light machine guns and rifles. The shooting came from a distance of 300 meters, from the direction of Dongning City on the opposite bank. The shooting lasted for 20 minutes, resulting in the death of three horses and the injury of one. Soviet border guards witnessed Japanese and "Manchurian" troops firing together. After the shooting, they fled into Dongning City. Soviet troops did not return fire. (TASS dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the incident on the 26th of this month in which Japanese and "Manchurian" troops opened fire on Soviet border guards near Potapovka, Mr. Kozlovsky of the Soviet Union lodged a protest with the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow today. (TASS dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the illegal border crossing by Soviet cavalry near Dongning, the Ministry of the Army received a detailed telegram from the Kwantung Army on the 28th, clarifying the incident. According to the report, in light of the recent surge in illegal border crossings by the Soviets, the Japanese garrison stationed there dispatched a unit to monitor the border. They discovered 20 Soviet cavalrymen crossing the Ussuri River and intruding into Manchurian territory. A Japanese officer ordered them to stop in Russian and warned that they would be shot if they did not comply. However, the Soviet soldiers ignored the warning and continued to advance across the border. The Japanese commander then ordered his troops to open fire, driving them back across the border. This action was taken to suppress illegal activities. However, the attitude of Soviet soldiers on the border has recently deteriorated significantly. They have repeatedly engaged in illegal shooting at the Japanese garrison. Since June, there have been dozens of incidents with hundreds of bullets fired at the Japanese side, causing the situation to worsen. Although serious protests have been lodged repeatedly, the Soviet side has shown no intention of reflecting on its actions. Foreign Minister Arita has also lodged a serious protest, demanding that the Soviet side reflect on its actions. However, the Russian side has disregarded Japan's protest and shown no intention of reflecting on its actions. If such illegal behavior continues in the future, the situation may inevitably escalate. The responsibility will not lie with Japan. The Japanese side is closely monitoring the situation. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Implements Strict Purges, Military Attaché to the UK Arrested, Rumored to be Related to Counter-Revolutionary Case</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Currently in Soviet Russia, the purge of remnants of the anti-Stalin faction within the Communist Party continues vigorously. According to Soviet press reports, communist party subcommittees across the country have passed multiple resolutions calling for the removal of suspected leading figures from their positions and demanding further investigation and reporting of criminals. This purge work is being carried out by ordinary party members, while the GPU (the name of the Soviet secret police) is only engaged in arresting suspects. The rumor that the power of the GPU has expanded has been denied by officials. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) According to evening newspapers, Soviet Embassy Military Attaché General Budny was recalled to the country three weeks ago to attend a military-political conference. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Moscow, he was arrested. It is now learned that during the recent trial of a counter-revolutionary case in Moscow, one of the defendants, named Treise, implicated General Budny in his testimony, claiming that he was in secret communication with Trotsky. This is the reason for the general's arrest. It is also learned that two days before the general was recalled, the Soviet Secret Political Police Bureau sent two high-ranking officials to England to inspect the private letters of all embassy staff. The officials collected two large boxes of these letters, which they immediately took back to Moscow. There may have been suspicious content in General Budny's private letters that was discovered by the Soviet authorities, leading to his arrest. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the news reported in the evening newspapers that Soviet Embassy Military Attaché General Budny was arrested in Moscow, embassy staff said they were completely unaware. One staff member only said that General Budny had returned to the country for business, and his wife had also followed him back to the country. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Stalin's Speech, Source of London Evening Newspaper's Information</h3>
<p>(London) The London Evening Standard reported today that radio listeners here received a broadcast from Moscow at 4:00 AM on Wednesday, in which General Tukhachevsky introduced Army Chief Voroshilov to speak to the Soviet Army. After that, another person spoke. Although his name was not reported, his voice was immediately recognized as Stalin. He said, "We are now on the eve of major events. You can be called upon at any time to sacrifice your lives to defend the birthplace of the proletariat. The enemy is armed and ready, so you must prepare quickly." Although Moscow has denied that Stalin gave a speech to the army, the Daily Mail still carried yesterday's news today. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>General Secretary of the British Trade Union Congress Speaks on the Current Situation in the Soviet Union, Stalin Seizes Total Power and Eliminates Dissent, Actively Expanding Military Preparations to Defend Against German Invasion</h3>
<p>(London) General Secretary Citrine of the British Trades Union Congress recently gave a speech at the Literary Association here, in which he researched the current and future situation of the Soviet Union. He briefly stated that although the implementation of democratic political systems and various principles in the Soviet Union still has a long way to go, it has indeed made much progress in other aspects. "The Soviet Union is dominated by the psychology that other countries may invade it, so its national policy is driven by this. At this moment, the threat of war has come to the Soviet Union. In the country's view, a German invasion is inevitable, so it is expanding its army and also announcing preparations to add airplanes to its air force, striving to match the combined strength of the air forces of other countries. In my view, the German government has repeatedly and clearly refused to conclude an agreement guaranteeing the security of the Soviet Union. The intention is not difficult to imagine. Is the Soviet Union's preparedness without reason?</p>
<p>Citrine went on to mention the recent counter-revolutionary case in Moscow, saying that the trial resulted in the death penalty for all sixteen defendants. He was shocked by this matter. Looking back to the beginning of the October Revolution in 1917, Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, Stalin, and Tomsky were all founding fathers. Today, some have died of illness, some have committed suicide, some have been exiled, and some have been executed by their comrades. The only one who remains is Stalin. The significance of this counter-revolutionary case may be to eliminate dissent and use the corpses of the sixteen defendants as a warning to make the people of the country take it as a lesson and dare not hold dissenting opinions again. From now on, Stalin's power will be greater than ever before. In my view, Soviet Russia is currently ruled by a small number of people, and the masses have no participation in politics, which is no different from other dictatorships. My view is fixed and unwavering. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Northern Spain, Both Armies Reach Stalemate, Rebel Attacks Fail Twice, Government Troops Make Slight Progress</h3>
<p>Andaye, Southern France Since the outbreak of fighting in the area around Irun in northern Spain, both sides have engaged in fierce battles for many days, but still remain at a stalemate. At 7:30 AM this morning, several units of the Foreign Legion belonging to the rebel army launched a fierce attack on the Duriarte mountain range, hoping to occupy it. They clashed with government troops. At 10:00 AM, the rebel artillery resumed heavy bombardment of Irun City. Both sides' air forces also launched sorties. Three government aircraft and three rebel aircraft engaged in combat in the sky. At the same time, the rebel warship "España" and the government's Guadalupe fortress exchanged fire, with a hail of bullets. The battle situation was extremely fierce. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Irun Our correspondent reports exclusively that another fierce battle broke out in the vicinity of this area this afternoon. After government troops repelled the rebels, they launched a counterattack starting at 5:00 PM, advancing several hundred meters. At the same time, the artillery fired on the rebel positions at the foot of Mount Uriat, causing panic in the rebel rear. The situation returned to silence in the evening, but the sound of artillery shells fired by government troops occasionally broke the silence. The rebel actions seemed to be greatly hindered by the government artillery fire. At the same time, several rebel aircraft flew from Burgos City to this area, circling several times, seemingly conducting aerial reconnaissance. The rebel cruiser "España" occasionally opened fire on the Guadalupe fortress. Furthermore, San Sebastian has dispatched a large number of reinforcements who are rushing here to strengthen the defenses. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Andaye Spanish government troops and rebel troops again engaged in fierce fighting today to seize Irun and San Sebastian. The rebels were again frustrated. After the government artillery began to bombard fiercely, the rebels' two-pronged attacks were repelled, forcing them to abandon their strategy of attacking along the main road from Pamplona to Irun. They later attempted to attack the side slopes of Mount Duriarte but were also frustrated. When reinforcements from the Burgos rebels arrived in the afternoon, the rebels made some progress in the mountains but failed to break through the government's superior position. As evening approached, the rebel artillery fire gradually weakened, and both sides seemed to want to rest briefly, so they withdrew their frontline troops. However, the rebels claimed that the former leader of the military occupied the town of Pantanaravilla near Badasa, and that government aircraft bombed the hospital in Jaca. It is reported that the local garrison commander stated that if government aircraft continued to drop bombs on the hospital, the local authorities intended to execute five government troops imprisoned in the town.

<h3>Rebel Army Occupies Key Terrain in Somo Mountain Area North of Beijing; Surprise Night Attack Overturns Control of Mountain Ridge</h3>
<p>A radio station belonging to the rebel army in Burgos broadcast a report yesterday stating that the rebel army had defeated government troops in the Somo Mountain area north of Beijing and immediately occupied the Navacerrada Pass. The area overlooks the Lozoya River valley and is strategically important. This newspaper's special correspondent has learned the details of the battle as follows: Three companies of the rebel army departed from the city of Guadarrama at the northern foot of Somo Mountain on Sunday of this week (the 23rd), intending to seize several strategically important locations to allow the main force to advance directly towards Madrid. After departing, the road was full of steep mountains and difficult terrain. Some mountain peaks were still covered in snow. As night fell, they took advantage of the darkness to sneak along, winding their way for more than seven hours, enduring many hardships before reaching the enemy's position. The position was the Navacerrada Pass, where government troops had set up camp on the mountaintop. The area was surrounded by deep trenches and full of machine guns, resembling a fortress. Under the cover of the dark, the rebel army advanced, reaching within 300 meters of the government troops' position. As dawn approached, they arrived at the front of the government troops' position and immediately charged with bayonets fixed, supported by continuous artillery fire. At the same time, three squadrons of aircraft flew overhead at an altitude of 500 meters, providing support. Each squadron consisted of four three-engine bombers, either opening fire with machine guns or dropping bombs. The government troops were suddenly attacked from above and below, and in a state of panic, quickly collapsed and fled, abandoning the mountaintop. More than sixty corpses were left behind. The retreating troops fired several volleys of shots as cover. The rebel army immediately raised the red and yellow flag (the national flag stipulated by the rebel army) on a tall tree on the mountaintop and sang patriotic songs to celebrate their victory.

<h3>Various Frontlines: Both Sides Claim Victory; Oviedo Surrounded by Government Troops</h3>
<p>Lisbon: The Spanish Civil War continues intensely today. Radio stations on both sides are claiming victory. The rebel radio station in Cordoba claimed that after a major battle, the rebel army had defeated the attacking government forces and captured countless spoils of war. The Madrid government radio station claimed that the artillery had destroyed the rebel radio station in Oviedo. Government troops in the Malaga area are advancing steadily. The navy is bombarding Palma. The rebels besieged in Palma sent a telegram to General Franco, commander of the southern front, informing him that the situation was critical, morale was low, and they would surrender if reinforcements did not arrive. The rebel radio station in Cadiz claimed that rebel aircraft had dropped multiple 100-pound bombs on the bullring in Madrid on Tuesday, destroying many vehicles gathered there. It also claimed that 150 aristocratic women and 300 officers and soldiers sympathetic to the rebels in Madrid had been massacred. However, General Queipo de Llano also announced on the rebel radio station in Seville that he had ordered that for every rebel executed, five Marxist families would be killed in retaliation. "The word 'mercy' is no longer in my dictionary," he said. (Guomin News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Burgos: This newspaper's special correspondent has learned the following about the war situation on various fronts: (1) The city of Oviedo in the northwest is surrounded by government troops. Three columns of rebel troops have been dispatched to provide assistance and lift the siege. (2) The government troops' positions in the province of Guipúzcoa in the north are gradually being surrounded by rebel troops. At the same time, the cruiser "Admiral Cervera" is bombarding the fortresses of San Sebastián. (3) On the eastern front in the province of Aragon, government troops attempted to besiege the city of Daroca, but were repelled by rebel troops. (4) In the Guadarrama Mountains north of Beijing, three government aircraft were shot down by rebel troops. Three other aircraft flew from Madrid and surrendered to the rebel troops. There is no other news. (5) The air force belonging to the rebel army flew to the city of Toledo south of Beijing and bombed and destroyed a munitions factory there. Of all the national munitions factories, this is the only one still in the hands of government troops. (6) On the southern front in the province of Cordoba, a unit of rebel troops engaged government troops in the city of Palma del Río. The government troops resisted fiercely, but eventually collapsed, abandoning many corpses and retreating. The rebel troops then occupied the city. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Ambassador to Britain Resigns Suddenly</h3>
<p>(London) The Spanish Ambassador to Britain, Oriol, who had only recently taken office, resigned suddenly this morning. It is rumored that his successor has already been chosen and is an extreme leftist. Some say this is a sign that the Spanish government is becoming increasingly leftist. It is noted that Oriol had always supported his country's government, but he also supported a movement initiated by foreign envoys in Spain to prevent cruel acts during the Spanish Civil War. This may have displeased his government. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>

The British government is willing to join in this appeal and is willing to fulfill its full responsibility in any organized international effort to achieve the results of this appeal.

<h3>Italian Government Authorizes Finance Minister to Issue Bonds in Foreign Markets; To Be Used for Developing Resources in Abyssinia; London Financial Circles are Indifferent</h3>
<p>(London) The Italian government today announced that it has authorized the Finance Minister to issue foreign currency treasury bonds in foreign markets. London financial circles are indifferent to this, saying that it is difficult to issue this bond at present because Italy's credit rating has fallen. To achieve good results with this issue, it will depend entirely on Italians residing abroad to express their patriotic zeal and actively purchase it. There are conflicting reports about the interest rate on this bond, with some saying 5% and others saying 6%. Financial circles show no sign of subscribing. Italian financiers in London hinted that this bond will be initially offered in New York this autumn, and then approximately raised in London. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government yesterday issued an order authorizing the Ministry of Finance to issue bonds abroad, and to use the funds raised to develop the resources of Abyssinia. According to responsible persons in financial circles here, this bond will be issued in the United States, but Johnson's Law, passed by the United States Congress in April 1934, stipulates that countries that have defaulted on debts cannot be granted loans. Italy should find a way to solve this difficulty. Generally speaking, outstanding debts owed by American businesses to Italy should be repaid by Italy as a condition of exchange.

<h3>Grand Confucius Ceremony in Qufu; Most of the Ancient Music in the Confucius Temple Is Incomplete; Chairman Lin's Eulogy Has Been Delivered</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Qufu is the birthplace of the former teacher Confucius and the place where his sacred body rests. The legacy and artifacts are all there, and they are all related to the culture and history of the East. For this year's Confucius birthday commemoration ceremony, the Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, specially wrote an eulogy and sent Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, as his representative to offer sacrifices. For the sake of careful worship and reverence for his predecessor, Han pre-appointed Li Shuchun, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and He Siyuan, Director of the Department of Education, to go to Qufu on a special train on the 25th to prepare everything. The reporter also went to observe the ceremony. Han himself also came south by special train on the 25th and will arrive before 7:00 AM on the 27th. On the afternoon of the 26th, He Siyuan and the artists who came to observe the ceremony, such as Liu Haisu, visited the Confucius Forest, paid respects at the Confucius Temple, Yan Temple, and Shao Hao Mausoleum, and other sacred sites. At about 5:00 PM, Li Shuchun, He Siyuan, and other participants in the ceremony rehearsed the rituals at the Confucius Temple. Confucius's sacrificial official, Kong Decheng, will go to Yanzhou on the 27th to welcome Han. The grand Confucius sacrifice ceremony will be solemnly held at the Confucius Temple in Qufu at 7:00 AM on the 27th.</p>
<p>The reporter learned the text of Chairman Lin's eulogy to Confucius from the ceremonial preparatory office. The text reads: "On the 27th day of the eighth month of the 25th year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, specially sent Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, to offer sacrifices to the spirit of the former teacher Confucius. Only the former teacher's Tao surpassed the past and present, and his virtues illuminated both China and foreign countries. With the sacredness of innate versatility, he established rules that had never existed for the people, selected the virtuous and capable, and made the world a public place. The Great Harmony was initiated, integrating the mind and governing in peace, consistently adhering to the principles of rectitude. With reverence, on the occasion of the anniversary of his birth, we perform the ceremony of sacrifice. Like a pearl balance and red thread, we remember the image at Mount Ni. Like jade chime and golden sound, we follow the rites and music at the Si River. May you enjoy the sacrifice."</p>
<p>The Confucius Temple used to use ancient musical instruments for the Confucius sacrifice, but now they are incomplete. The reporter visited Kong Lingshu, the director of the Ancient Music Training Institute, to inquire about how many types of ancient musical instruments there are, how many of each type, and whether the playing methods are still transmitted. According to Kong (Lingshu), there are six qin and four se, all of which have been lost. All six dongxiao and dizi sheng are complete. Two guan, four chi, chi have been lost. Zhu yu and kuo fu·tao drum are each two are complete. Tian drum two, Ying drum one, foot drum one, are complete, Suspended drum one has been lost. Bo bell one, bianzhong sixteen, teqing one, are complete. Bianqing sixteen, have been half-lost. He also said that Hunan still has a complete set of ancient musical instruments. When the institute's finances are sufficient, they will go to Hunan to visit and try to complete them. Otherwise, in a few years, the playing methods of ancient music will be lost, and there will be the regret of not being able to play them.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he visited Confucius's sacrificial official, Kong Decheng, and asked about his recent life and the date of his marriage to Ms. Sun Qifang, as reported in the news. According to Kong, his daily life is mostly uneventful, except for reading. Recently, due to the hot weather, he only reads for six hours a day. In addition to the Spring and Autumn Annals and the classics, he also studies arithmetic, history, and geography. Regarding his research on reading the classics, he felt that Liu Xin was a thief of the classics. Liu Xin was a member of the Han imperial family and the son of Liu Xiang. He led the collection of secret texts and divided the six arts and books into seven abstracts, creating the beginning of later generations' catalogs of classics and books. He planned to list the Zuo Zhuan and the Mao Poetry as official studies, which was criticized by later scholars. Kong criticized Liu for this. He also talked about Han Chairman (Fuqu) advocating the Confucian Association, which showed respect and admiration. Not only is the Kong clan grateful, but also the people of the whole country. At a time when the Confucian path is declining, it is necessary to advocate and urgently seek restoration. The dispute over the sacrifice fields in Sishui was also completely resolved by Chairman Han sending Zhang Senyi (Shouqian). As for his marriage to Sun Qifang, it is purely in accordance with old etiquette and entirely based on matchmakers. The previous report that Zhang Zongchang's daughter proposed to him when he was Governor of Shandong in the 17th year of the Republic of China is not true. At that time, he was only seven years old and could not talk about marriage. It is now scheduled to be held in November of the lunar calendar, but the location, whether in Jinan or Qufu, has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Chahar North and Suiyuan East</h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch, Talk from a Guest from Suiyuan: Since the bandit troops in Chahar North were repelled after invading Suiyuan East, foreign sources have paid close attention to the situation in Suiyuan and believe that the situation in Suiyuan is extremely tense. In fact, the people in the provincial capital of Suiyuan, as well as Jining, Fengzhen, and other counties, are very stable, and the business situation is as before, not as serious as rumored. However, the hidden crisis in Suiyuan Province is an undeniable fact. The five counties in Suiyuan East (Jining, Taolin, Xinghe, Fengzhen, and Liangcheng) are close to Chahar North. Jining is only ninety li away from Shangdu, and Xinghe is very close to Zhangbei, only thirty li away. It can be reached by car in half an hour. Currently, the outposts of Suiyuan East and Chahar North are only a dozen li apart. There are a total of ten thousand troops stationed in Suiyuan. In Suiyuan East, there is a part of Li Fuying's two divisions, Zhao Chengshou's cavalry, Fu Zuoyi's infantry, and Zhou Dai's artillery. The officials and people of Suiyuan Province unanimously expressed that they will never give way to anyone who disturbs the security of the province and vow to fight to the end. Baotou is also peaceful, but Japanese planes often travel back and forth between Ping and Bao, and two or three Japanese planes are stationed in Baotou for a long time.</p>
<p>In Chahar North, after the six counties of Zhangbei, Guyuan, Shangdu, Baochang, Kangbao, and Huade were occupied by puppet troops, bandits gathered in large numbers, including Li Shouxin, Zhuoshikai, Wang Ying, Su Meilong, and others. After they arrived, they changed Jiabu Temple to Dehua (i.e., changed the province to Huade) County, and Daqinggou to Shangyi County. As for the puppet army's defense area, Li Shouxin is stationed in Shangdu with more than three thousand troops, and only two-thirds of them have guns. Their organization is three companies per regiment, and each company has only fifty people. Su Meilong's bandits originally had more than a thousand troops, but now they have been incorporated by Wang Ying. Wang Daoyi's bandit troops claim to have two to three thousand people. After the failure of the recent invasion of Suiyuan East, they suffered heavy losses and are now retreating to the four rural areas and the Baitazi area for reorganization. Wang Ying's troops only have a little over a thousand people, with both Mongolian and puppet troops, which is quite chaotic. Currently, the puppet army is actively extorting horses and forcibly conscripting laborers in Chahar North. It is expected that the bandit army will invade Suiyuan East again. The Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Seishiro Itagaki, flew to Suiyuan on the 25th, and his mission is likely to inquire about everything so that he can prepare for corresponding steps. In Kangbao, there is also a Mongolian military training center set up by De Wang, with two to three thousand new recruits, who were also forcibly conscripted and are currently being trained.</p>
<p>According to another dispatch from Zhangjiakou, De Wang, under pressure from a certain party, contacted Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, Zhang HaiPeng and others, in order to launch a large-scale attack on Suiyuan, and scheduled a military conference at Bailingmiao on September 2nd to discuss the steps for invading Suiyuan East. At that time, De Wang, Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, and Zhang Haipeng will all participate. Currently, within fifteen li around Jiabu Temple, the puppet army is raping, plundering, and looting, which is unspeakable, but they are better to merchants. Currently, merchants from Zhangyuan have opened stores in Jiabu Temple, and sales have been quite extensive recently. A lot of goods have been transported from Zhangyuan in recent days. A certain party issued military pay to the bandits on the 25th, and it was decided that the bandit troops would move westward on the 26th. The troops receiving pay in Jiabu Temple included the subordinates of the Mongolian soldiers Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, Zhang Haipeng, etc. (26th)</p>
<h3>Zhangyuan Cao Lun Greedily Rented Out House to Foreigners, Arrested and Sent to Bureau, Fined 600 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Communication: In recent months, during the eventful autumn in Chahar North, certain foreigners in Zhangyuan have been arrogant and domineering, doing whatever they want, and it has been quite difficult to maintain local security. Recently, a resident named Cao Lun had an empty house in Fengjia Garden and privately rented the house to the Qiaodong Zhongyuan Chamber of Commerce (operated by certain foreigners) for a rent of 400 yuan, without reporting it to the Public Security Bureau beforehand. On the night of the 20th, the Zhongyuan Chamber of Commerce sent people to clean the house, and they were discovered by the duty police of the Third District Public Security Bureau. They immediately reported to the sub-bureau, and the sub-bureau chief sent policemen to take Cao Lun and a group of offenders to the bureau and transferred them to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for interrogation. After repeated interrogations by the Provincial Public Security Bureau, Cao Lun admitted that he privately rented the house to foreigners without concealment. The Public Security Bureau planned to fine him 600 yuan to repair the city's standard clock, and it has now been submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. (25th)</p>
<h3>The Widely Circulated Revenge Case of the Wronged Ghost in Chao-Shan</h3>
<p>Shantou Communication: Huang Ashuang of Dazhubao, Fourth District, Meixian County, was a moderately wealthy man who had a long-standing feud with his cousin Huang Taode over a family property dispute. On February 29th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Taode colluded with bandits, broke into the house and killed Huang Ashuang. Huang Ashuang's wife, Zhong, was also stabbed in multiple places, and all the property was looted. Huang Taode then fled with the bandits. After a long time, he returned home and falsely claimed that he had also been kidnapped by bandits. It was found that his family was poor and had no money to redeem him, so he was released. Huang Zhong knew that he colluded with bandits to commit the crime and kill her husband, but she dared not say it openly. Later, the district office discovered that Taode was highly suspected and detained him in the county government. The former county magistrate, Peng Jingyi, sentenced him to ten years in prison and reported it to the headquarters of the First Army Group for handling. The headquarters believed that there were many suspicious points in the case's confession, so it rejected it for retrial in order to determine the crime. Subsequently, due to changes in the Guangdong situation, the case was repeatedly delayed. On the 18th of this month, County Magistrate Liang Hanzhao summoned a group of witnesses and held a trial at night. Chief Judge Han sat in court and summoned Zhong for questioning. Zhong suddenly changed her state, and her actions and accent were just like Huang Ashuang appearing in person. She spoke in a man's voice and confessed how Huang Taode colluded with the bandits to commit the crime, where he hid afterward, and every detail was as vivid as a picture. Chief Judge Han and the people who were recording the confession in court were all moved and changed color. Zhong also described Taode's words and actions in the bandits' place, the names of the bandits, and how the stolen silver was distributed, all one by one. However, Taode still sophistically argued that Zhong was suffering from a mental illness and that what she said could not be completely believed. Before he finished speaking, Taode's face suddenly changed greatly, and he spat out white phlegm. He also spoke in Ashuang's accent and cursed Huang Taode for being so devoid of conscience and how he committed the crime and how he fled, revealing all kinds of circumstances. Chief Judge Han was so frightened that his face turned pale, and beads of sweat rolled down his forehead. The person recording the confession trembled and could not record. Chief Judge Han hurriedly left the court and went inside, intending to ask County Magistrate Liang for instructions on how to sentence the crime in order to comfort the wronged soul. At that time, County Magistrate Liang had been eavesdropping behind the screen after receiving a report from the people standing in court. Han entered, and Liang ordered him to quickly leave the court to avoid such strange things from happening again, which could not be dealt with. So, he shackled Taode and imprisoned him in the county government. The people in the county government were frightened all night, and no one dared to close their eyes. The next day, County Magistrate Liang summoned Huang Zhong to the inner court. Because her situation was pitiful, he specially issued 50 yuan in condolence money to send her home and sentenced Huang Taode to the most severe punishment. He reported to Yu Hanmou, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, for approval by telegram. On the 24th, Taode's identity was verified, and he was escorted to the execution ground and shot to death in public to warn the masses. This revenge case of the wronged ghost spread throughout Chao-Mei. (24th)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Smugglers Beat and Insult Xiamen Customs Officers, Two Seriously Injured and More Than Ten Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The Japanese ship Fujian Maru arrived in Xiamen from Taiwan on the morning of the 26th. More than ten customs officers, including the British Deputy Inspector of the Outer Section, Yi Wannafu, and inspectors Pan Dehua, Wu Chuntai, Xu Daozu, Huang Yipei, Chen Shaoyi, Sun Dajing, and Han Shikui, went down to the ship for inspection. In the clothes and pants pockets of a certain smuggler from Taiwan, they found more than twenty fountain pens and immediately detained them, ordering him to pay taxes. The smuggler refused to pay taxes and tried to snatch them back. The customs officers refused, so he started beating them. At that time, there were many Taiwanese smugglers on the ship, who rushed forward and surrounded the customs officers. They used baseball bats, cymbals, and other weapons to beat them. One of the customs officers broke free and went to see the captain, asking him to send a radio message to the customs radio station and to signal with flags and blow the whistle more than twenty times to notify the customs to come to the rescue. At this time, the ship was moored at sea. Upon receiving the news, the Customs Commissioner immediately telegraphed the Japanese Consul to jointly board the ship with three members of the Japanese consulate and two British customs officers on a speedboat. Only then did they disperse the Taiwanese smugglers who were beating people, arrest five Taiwanese perpetrators, and take them back to the Japanese consulate. The customs confiscated twenty fountain pens, and the weapons used in the attack were also brought back as evidence for negotiations. The Customs Commissioner believed that the Taiwanese smugglers had repeatedly beaten and insulted customs officers, which was illegal, and immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul, demanding: (1) Punishment of the perpetrators; (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen in the future. Negotiations are currently underway. Chen Shaoyi and Huang Yipei were the most seriously injured among the injured customs officers, and the rest were slightly injured. According to doctors, Chen and Huang need long-term treatment to recover. As for the so-called "smugglers," they are people who carry goods on ships and specialize in smuggling. (August 27th)</p>

<h3>Taicang: Cotton Selection Demonstration</h3>
<p>Mixed cotton selection is the easiest and most effective method for farmers to keep good seeds and maintain cotton quality.

<h3>Wuxi: Giant Black Fish Discovered</h3>
<p>Behind Zhou Pai Lane, Seventh Bao, Yangdong Township, Third District, outside the South Gate, there is an unattended pond with an area of about three mu. The northern part is two zhang deep and as clear as a mirror. Recently, a giant fish was suddenly discovered in the pond, with a jet-black body, a head as big as a dipper, and a length of seven or eight chi, floating in the center of the pond, raising its head and spraying water towards the sun. When it was glimpsed by the villagers, it was immediately spread throughout the village, and those who saw it marveled at it. However, when the giant fish heard human voices, it would dive to the bottom of the water and not come out for a long time. Currently, the residents of the village are planning to drain the pond and find a way to catch it.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Cargo Boat Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Pu Gezui in Xihu Port, Xiangshan, is a mooring place for merchant ships. Cargo boats from various places gather to load and transport passengers and goods.

Unexpectedly, when they sailed to the waters of Dachanzui near Xiasha, they suddenly saw four bandit ships coming head-on. The cargo boats tried to escape but were unable to do so and were robbed. The two boats were robbed of more than 3,000 yuan of passengers' goods and cash. After the bandits were full, they set sail and left. The two boats sailed back to Qiangtou and Huangxi. Because the passengers were terrified, they were in a panic when they landed.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Slaughtering of Ploughing Cattle in Xindai</h3>
<p>This year, the whole county had a bumper harvest. In Xindai Town, a group of ruffians incited the slaughter of cattle to sell meat. Initially, hot pot restaurants were set up in the southern township, and recently, they have extended to the northern township. The money from selling cattle is used for gambling. Since the Republic of China, the town has strictly prohibited the private slaughter of ploughing cattle, and there have been results for twenty years. Unfortunately, the trend of killing cattle has resurged this year. It is said that the Xindai Town District Office has ordered police officers to investigate and arrest them.</p>
<h3>Shangyu: District Committee Summoned Opium Offenders</h3>
<p>In the afternoon of the 25th of this month, two members of the Shaoxing District Security Command suddenly came to the county government with secret orders, stating that Wang Wulie, the fifth section chief of the county government, and Huang Langyuan, the former director of the Shangyu Opium Suppression Institute of the Shaoxing District Security Command, were suspected of smoking opium. The Executive Yuan secretly ordered the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command to instruct the District Command to come to Yu to summon them. It is said that County Magistrate Chen Daxun accompanied the district committee and a group of offenders to Hangzhou that day.</p>
<h3>Attempted Murder of Husband</h3>
<p>Shi Zhenhua, a resident of Yindong, is 33 years old and works as a farmer. He married a Wang woman from the same village as his wife. She is 26 years old this year. Wang is naturally shrewish and often treats her husband like a slave. The other night, after the couple had a verbal dispute over a trivial matter, Wang took advantage of her husband's sleep and stabbed him in the throat with sharp scissors. Zhenhua screamed in pain and was rescued by neighbors who heard the sound. Wang, fearing punishment, went downstairs and tried to commit suicide with the scissors, but was also rescued by neighbors. Zhenhua specially dragged Wang to the nearby police station to report her and transferred her to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Cixi: Loan Settlement for the Purchase of American Species</h3>
<p>The Cixi-Huai County Cotton Transportation and Marketing Cooperative Union borrowed 10,000 yuan from the Kenye Bank for the purchase of American cotton. The contract was signed yesterday with County Magistrate Dai as the guarantor. The bank will pay 20,000 yuan in advance. When the cooperative receives cotton from the tenant farmers, the bank will pay the estimated value. The cooperative will repay the full amount after the last batch of American cotton is sold. The deadline is set for five months.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou: Severe Drought and Rampant Epidemic</h3>
<p>In the counties of Pingyang, Yuhuan, Leqing, etc. under Wenzhou, the weather has been extremely hot and there has been no rain for the past month. The late rice cannot be irrigated due to the depletion of river water. The soil is cracked and the rice stalks are like burning. This year's autumn harvest will be hopeless. The farmers are heartbroken and anxious. They have set up altars to pray for rain. In Yu Township, Pingyang, due to the drought, there is a panic over drinking water. Recently, cholera has suddenly been discovered, and the number of deaths has reached seven or eight.</p>
<h3>Letter: Letter from Shen Youyi of Jiading</h3>
<p>"Recently, I read the Jiading local news column in your newspaper on August 25, which mentioned that the central school was destroyed. After investigation, it does not conform to the facts at the time. According to Youyi, the brothers Youkang and Jin Guobao have always been friends. In the afternoon of the 23rd, at the Malu Central School, they talked to Jin Guobao about the fact that they had previously asked Jin to dredge the county education bureau, and the bureau did not hire him for not attending the lecture. Jin became ashamed and angry because Youkang mentioned the misspelled word in Jin's letter to the former teaching director, which led to a quarrel. As for the destruction and leading the rogues, the teachers of the school were all indoors at the time, which can prove that this did not happen. What your newspaper reported, I think it is a mistake of hearsay. I specially write to ask for correction. Shen Youyi" Qi, August 26, Correspondence address, Jiading Private Chengde School.</p>
<h3>Estimate of German Combat Power (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— by French General ×, translated by Yue Qi</p>
<p>Finally, let us examine the raw materials for manufacturing military supplies—such as metals, yarns, rubber, fuel, and oil—and the factories that use these raw materials to make guns, cannons, cloths, tires, gasoline, and ammunition. In other words, let us examine Germany's industrial capabilities.</p>
<p>Germany's iron metal production was originally not developed. The loss of the Lorraine mines has reduced its metal resources by two-thirds compared to before the Great War. Currently, out of the annual iron ore consumption of 16,700,000 tons, 6,000,000 tons are produced domestically, and the rest are imported from abroad. After the successful mining of iron ore in Palatinate and South Baden, the annual output can be increased by one million tons. But in any case, domestic production is never enough to meet consumption.</p>
<p>Of course, Germany is importing a large amount of steel to prevent the risk of being sealed off during wartime, but half of it is supplied by France, which is its enemy in future wars, and it is questionable whether this large supply will last. The supply from other countries—mainly Sweden—accounts for only a small number and cannot make up for its lack during wartime.</p>
<p>Germany has almost no copper mines; the copper mines of the Manslield Company only supply 10% of consumption: in 1934, out of the total consumption of 287,000 tons, only 28,000 tons were produced domestically. Imports supplied by the United States, South Africa, Belgian Congo, Chile, and other countries will stop when the war starts; no matter how sufficient the reserves are, there is no doubt that they will soon run out. Germany is well aware of this danger, so it is working hard to replace copper with aluminum and other metals it lacks—such as zinc and tin.</p>
<p>Germany is the world's largest aluminum producer. In 1933, the output reached 18,000 tons; in 1934, it reached 46,000 tons; in 1935, it reached 52,000 tons. But it lacks the raw materials for making aluminum. Its bauxite and cryolite production is almost zero: in 1929, bauxite production was only 7,300 tons; in 1934, bauxite imports reached 326,500 tons. To prevent its main suppliers (France, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Italy) from stopping supplies during wartime, Germany is working hard to extract aluminum from the mud in its own soil. According to German newspapers, this problem has been solved, but the facts proving this news have not yet appeared.</p>
<p>Germany's textile raw materials are very scarce. At most, only 10% of the total consumption of flax and hemp is supplied by the country; natural silk and cotton are almost non-existent. Therefore, Germany has to find ways to remedy this, such as expanding the area of flax cultivation, increasing wool production, manufacturing rayon, and inventing mixed grain textile fabrics.</p>
<p>As for coal, we can observe it from two figures: the annual consumption is 275,000,000 tons; the annual output is 181,000,000 tons.</p>
<p>Germany's Thuringia and Hanover are famous throughout the country for their oil production, and there are many oil wells there. In recent years, their output has quadrupled. In 1935, the output reached 104,000 tons. But compared to Germany's oil consumption (3,322,000 tons in 1934), this output is very small.</p>
<p>Putting petroleum aside, let's look at the situation of lubricating oil (gasoline and petroleum spirits). In 1935, gasoline consumption reached 1,218,000 tons, and the output of gasoline refineries across the country was only 150,999 tons, a difference of more than one million tons. Fortunately, Germany is very rich in coal and lignite, and gasoline can be made from these two raw materials with the research of experts. The Leuna Works, which manufactures gasoline from coal slag, was established in 1929, and its annual output is expected to increase to 350,000 tons this year. In 1932, a certain factory in Nessebrug successfully tested the hydrogenation of lignite, and from then on, 300,000 tons of gasoline could be made from lignite every year. In October 1934, the Braunkohlen Cmpnyao, which is engaged in gasoline manufacturing, was established with a capital of 100 million marks.</p>
<p>From now on, Germany can manufacture 650,000 tons of synthetic gasoline, plus 150,000 tons of gasoline produced from oil wells, and the annual gasoline output can reach 800,000 tons. In a few more years, Germany's gasoline production can correspond to consumption. Unfortunately, synthetic gasoline is not suitable for aircraft engines; it is certainly impossible to supply all natural gasoline to aircraft engines.</p>
<p>Then, Germany's aviation problem has not yet been solved. But it will always be solved in the future. When this problem is solved, Germany's military power will at least double.</p>
<p>The production of another important fuel, petroleum spirits, is almost in line with needs: consumption is 320,000 tons, and production is 280,000 tons. As for alcohol, production is sufficient to supply consumption. In short, with the wisdom of chemists and the talent of technicians, Germany can soon make up for the lack of nature with synthetic products.</p>
<p>Industrial mobilization is one of the most complex problems in modern military affairs. The number of factories that manufacture military supplies in peacetime is insufficient during wartime. For example, at the end of 1914, the German artillery manufacturing industry produced 100 cannons per month. By June 1918, the German army needed 1,000 cannons per month, but there was still no shortage. To achieve this production standard, all factories in the country must be fully mobilized and participate in the manufacturing of an unlimited amount of military equipment.</p>
<p>Germany's industrial capabilities are unparalleled. The previous Great War has given us a lot of evidence: 3,000 white cannons, 11 million bombs, 14,000 machine guns, 250,000 rifles, and 12,000 tons of gunpowder. These quantities are not unusual because enemy countries can also equip them in the same amount. But the danger lies in the fact that Germany's entire industry is currently specializing in the manufacturing of military supplies, and its organization is the same as during wartime. Its mobilization period has ended, and the standstill period necessary for transforming factories when the war starts is almost non-existent, while in other countries, such a standstill period requires at least six months or more.</p>
<p>Strong industrial power, but insufficient raw materials—these are the two major characteristics of Germany. Germany can support itself. It can produce more and faster than any other European country. However, unless the goal of not relying on foreign imports of important raw materials is achieved, its huge efforts will always fail. When estimating Germany's combat power, the only shortcoming that can be considered is this. (Translated from Vu Weekly)</p>

<p>City News</p>
<h3>Four Groups Elect National Assembly Representative Candidates Today; Agricultural and Commercial Members to Take Oath Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The election of candidates for representatives to the National Assembly in this city will be held today by the labor union, lawyers, accountants, and medical professionals. Agricultural and fishing members will take the oath tomorrow. Members of trade associations will also take the oath tomorrow. Details are as follows:</p>

The quota is three for the labor union, ten for lawyers, five for accountants, and eight for medical professionals. After the election, personally cast the ballot into the ballot box that has been verified publicly. The polling officer and supervisor will affix a seal and wait for the legal period to open the ballot box and count the votes. As for the personnel supervising and managing the voting in each place today, the office has appointed Li Weixiong from the General Labor Union as the supervisor, and Wu Wenbang and Pan An as the managers. The three free professional groups of the Lawyers Association, etc., will be supervised by Cao Peizi and Chen Junyi, and managed by Hu Tianseng, Li Zhixiang, and Yuan Zengyu. (Reporter's note: The original text of Article 21 of the Election Law: The candidates for the professional groups in each province should have the following qualifications: (1) Have the qualifications of an elector; (2) Be at least twenty-five years old; (3) Have been engaged in the respective profession for more than three years; (4) Be a current member of the respective group. If the years of engaging in the profession in the previous item are intermittent, the combined periods shall be calculated.)</p>
<p>Agricultural and Fishing Members to Take Oath Tomorrow: The citizen oath registration of members of the agricultural association and fishing association was originally scheduled to be held today, but it has now been changed to be held tomorrow (30th) starting at 8:00 AM due to insufficient preparation. The location is still in the respective district agricultural association and the city fishing association. The office has already published a notice in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Oath Period for Chamber of Commerce: The office has also scheduled the citizen oath registration of members of more than 200 trade associations in the city to be held tomorrow (30th) starting at 9:00 AM and ending at 4:00 PM. The locations are divided into three places: (1) the City Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge; (2) the Nanshi Branch Office of the City Chamber of Commerce on Zhonghua Road, Xiaonanmen; (3) the Renyi Shantang inside the Yanghuo Guild Hall at Dongxin Bridge.

<h3>A Certain Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters Expresses Opinions on National Elections, Striving to Ensure Everyone Cherishes Their Civil Rights, Enhances Political Patriotism, and Participates in Elections</h3>
<p>The Kuomintang News Agency reports that the national election procedures in this city have gradually entered the election stage. Social organizations have expressed very few opinions. Yesterday, a reporter from the Kuomintang News Agency visited a certain standing committee member of the municipal party headquarters to inquire about everything. The standing committee member expressed many opinions, which are recorded as follows. The standing committee member stated that the Central Government's convocation of the National Assembly to exercise the highest ruling power of the state is a clear indication that Chinese politics is gradually entering the constitutional stage from the period of political tutelage. Everyone knows the importance of its relation and the weight of its mission. Therefore, the successive plenary sessions of the Central Committee have repeatedly revised the draft constitution and precisely stipulated the principles of the election law, all with extensive consultation and careful consideration. Their painstaking efforts to attach importance to this national election and guide the people to exercise their political power are truly admirable. In terms of the electoral system, the regional system is adopted to seek its universality, and the professional system is adopted to seek its expertise. In terms of electoral methods, there are no restrictions on property, no discrimination based on gender, and no requirements for educational level. All adult citizens, regardless of gender, wealth, intelligence, or foolishness, have extensive rights to vote and be elected. Moreover, it reverses the previous step-by-step elections of primary and secondary elections, and instead uses universal and direct elections. Although it is in the period of political tutelage, circles must be added to indicate its scope, but the final decision still depends on the citizens of various places. It can be seen that the breadth and directness of this election right is opening the most glorious page in the history of Chinese elections. If the people of the whole country can enthusiastically participate, then the constitutional process will have a solid foundation. Otherwise, even if the country has a good system, it will often be counterproductive due to the improper use of personnel. There are many examples in the past. Although there are many enthusiastic and attentive people in promoting this national election, most of the general public is still indifferent. Some even refuse to register because they do not understand the content. The Municipal Party Headquarters has issued a letter to the people and scattered slogans and leaflets to call people's attention, but unfortunately, it has not been universal and in-depth. All groups have the responsibility of leading the people, and should widely advocate in this national election campaign, such as the instructions of election procedures, the identification of talent standards, and the discussion of national election issues. All efforts should be devoted to this. Schools should also compile national election issues into temporary teaching materials and teach them at any time, so that everyone can cherish their civil rights, enthusiastically participate in the grand event of national elections, enhance their political awareness, and develop their patriotic concepts. This is a rare opportunity to implement political education. As for the spirit of the election, it lies in electing the wise and capable. Therefore, the selection of talents is crucial. How to indicate standards for selection, how to establish a scope for selection, and how to publish political views for self-introduction are all things that professional groups from all walks of life can do at this time, so that talented people have the hope of being elected, and mediocre people have no way to advance by luck. People should use their talents, and the country can use them, so that the central government will not fail the original intention of protecting civil rights.</p>

<h3>Journalists Association Sent a Letter to the National Election Office to Designate the Nomination Date for Candidates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association, because the nomination of candidates for the National Assembly is imminent, but has not yet received the nomination date designated by the National Election Office, convened a standing committee meeting yesterday to discuss. It was resolved to send a letter to the National Election Office to inquire. The original letter is copied as follows: Respected sirs, before the election of representatives of the National Assembly's free professional groups, the General Election Office telegraphed that the nomination of candidates should be completed before the 31st of this month. This association was previously informed by your office that it was legally qualified to participate in the election. However, today's newspaper reports that your office's 18th circular has not included the nomination date for this association. Time is pressing. Therefore, this letter is to request your office to designate the nomination date as soon as possible. Sincerely hope for your public cooperation. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Representative Election Office of the National Assembly, Shanghai Journalists Association, August 29, 25th year of the Republic.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Elder You Lie Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday Morning, Stating That He Came Here for Convalescence Due to Old Age and Illness, and Does Not Read Newspapers Often and Has No Opinions to Express on Current Affairs</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Mr. Yun Lie, a revolutionary elder, old friend of the late Premier, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday morning on the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Lines. Representative Sun Ke and others went to the wharf to welcome him and made speeches. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning Those who went to the wharf to welcome him yesterday were all friends. Therefore, few outsiders knew about this trip to Shanghai. They included a representative of Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, as well as Zhou Binghua, Tan Haiqiu, Lu Jiale, Zhang Fan, Li Yiqin, Wang Haishan, Yun Wenwei, Wang Ziyang, and other people holding banners welcoming Mr. Yun Shaowen. The people who came with Yun included Secretary Ma Baimei, Doctor Chen Jing'an, Attaché Zhuo Wuchu, Li Zetang, Yin Yechun, and other five people. Yun was seasick on the ship and was very tired. When he got off the ship, he was helped onto a small boat and leaned on the sofa. At about 10 o'clock, he arrived at the New Customs Wharf and landed. He immediately took a car and returned to the Qiupu residence on Jessfield Road to rest.</p>
<p>You Lie's Demeanor Mr. Yun Lie is seventy-two years old this year. He is an old friend of the late Premier and made great contributions to the creation of the revolution. Mr. Yun participated in every righteous act. For example, when General Wu Luzhen launched an incident in Shijiazhuang and General Cai Songpo launched a revolt in Yunnan, both relied on Mr. Yun's persuasion and advocacy. After the Republic of China was established, he retired to practice medicine and help the world. He was indifferent to fame and wealth, honest and upright, fond of learning, and admired for his virtues. He is a rare person in the world. This time, he was fortunate to come to Shanghai for recuperation with the help of friends. Yesterday, Yun wore a white silk long gown, a black gauze mandarin jacket, cloth-soled shoes, and a long beard. He looked dignified, similar to the image of the most holy teacher Confucius. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency insisted on an interview on the ship. Yun nodded frequently, indicating that the attendant should talk. According to him, Yun has been in Hong Kong for one or two decades and rarely goes out. This time, he plans to stay in Shanghai for a long time for recuperation and invites famous Chinese doctors for diagnosis and treatment. Because of his old age and physical discomfort, he usually only writes and plays chess in Hong Kong. The Shanghai residence is borrowed from Qiupu, No. 15 Jessfield Road, the residence of Tan Haiqiu.</p>
<p>Speeches A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited again in the afternoon yesterday and was received. He was told that because of his old age, he had no intention of traveling far. Recently, he often felt uncomfortable, and friends advised him to change places for recuperation. Therefore, he came here and did not assume other tasks. Before coming to Shanghai, many people in Hong Kong inquired about his views on the overall situation in the Southwest. However, the central government adhered to the principle of internal pacification and external resistance, and resolved the crisis in the Southwest without bloodshed, which is indeed a proposition to save the country and the people. He hopes very much to unify the national system, complete the national elections, and unify political views. We must use the power of the whole people to save the country in the shortest possible time. This is his greatest wish. He does not read newspapers often and is not clear about the current situation, so he has no opinions to express. He hopes for understanding. The reporter excused himself and left because the gentleman was mentally exhausted and it was not convenient to ask more questions.</p>
<h3>New British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen, Arrives in China, Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on September 12th</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that according to this morning's (August 28) news from the British Consulate-General in Shanghai, the new British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen, is coming to China on the Empress of Canada and is currently en route to Japan. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Japan on the British Post Office's SS Chitral on September 13. Because of the short stay in Shanghai after arriving, the arrangements for welcoming the Ambassador have not yet been decided. The Ambassador's entourage includes his wife, one son, and two daughters. They will arrive in Japan on September 5 and will come to Shanghai after a short stay. His family will go to Peiping. Although the Ambassador's office in China will be located in the capital, it is heard that the British Embassy will still be located in Peiping. It is not yet known when the Ambassador will present his credentials to the National Government. Since being appointed Ambassador to China, the Ambassador has focused on learning Chinese language and inquired about Chinese politics and customs from Chinese people living in Britain. He has also studied the Far East issue extensively. In addition, he is amiable and approachable. Therefore, after taking office, he will be able to integrate with Chinese and foreign diplomats.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation Held a Special Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Inland Sales of Man-made Silk Products</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation held a special meeting yesterday to discuss ways to prevent smuggling and sales of man-made silk blended products. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the federation held a special meeting at Gaodun Street in the city. Representatives from the Shanghai Hang Silk Industry Association, Danyang Silk Merchant Association, Suzhou Gauze and Satin Association, Wuxian Iron Loom Silk Weaving Industry Association, Shanghai Su Satin Group, Nanjing Satin Industry Association, Wuxian Gauze and Satin Industry Association, Hangzhou Silk Industry Association, Shengjing Group, Shengze Silk Industry Association, Shanghai Crepe Guild, Shengjing Guild, Shanghai Silk and Satin Association, and Xiashi Silk Industry Association, including Shen Xinquan, Zhao Chuanzhong, Dai Shichang, Tai Maozhang, Shen Boming, Lou Fengshao, and other 50 people, attended the meeting. Wang Jiean presided over the meeting, and Sun Zheng recorded the minutes.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report After the ceremony, Chairman Wang Jiean reported, "Dear representatives, since the Ministry of Finance stipulated the regulations for the sales of man-made silk woven products with licenses, our silk industry has felt hindered and difficult to implement. The Shanghai Satin Industry Association has sent representatives to Beijing several times to petition Minister Kong and Director Gao, requesting some flexibility to facilitate transportation. Although they agreed to let the Director-General of Customs handle it, our association also sent a telegram requesting it. However, no concrete measures have been obtained so far. Therefore, we have convened a meeting of colleagues from the two provinces today to discuss it. I hope everyone will express their great opinions for discussion."</p>
<p>Resolutions After the representatives from various places contributed their local situations and opinions, after discussion, (1) A resolution was made to ratify the telegram sent by Wen Dai on the 12th of this month to Minister Kong and Director Gao of the Ministry of Finance, requesting a flexible sales method for man-made silk blended products. (2) A resolution was made to discuss the issue of inland sales of man-made silk blended products. A resolution was made that representatives from various places should first submit the local situations and opinions in writing. After gathering them, they will request the Ministry of Finance's Customs Department to make changes. The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association specially hosted a banquet at Yuebinlou last night at 7:00 p.m. to welcome the representatives from various places. The hosts and guests parted happily at 10:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fu Rulin's Mission to Shanghai is to Inspect the Baimao Sluice Project</h3>
<p>The National Economic Commission built the Baimao Sluice along the river in Changshu. Now that it is completed, it specially sent member Chuan Rulin to inspect and accept it. Chuan left Beijing on the night train on the 27th and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Fu said that the acceptance ceremony will be held at the construction site on the 29th. He will take a car with participants from all parties that morning.</p>
<h3>Three Articles of the Trade Association Law, Requested for Interpretation, National Federation of Commerce Telegrams the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry yesterday, "We have just received a letter from the Chongqing Mountain Goods Industry Trade Association stating that our association's business includes mountain goods such as cattle and sheep hides, pork floss, tung oil, and raw lacquer. Traditionally, the members of the trade association collect and transport them for export, which is a major part of Sichuan's foreign trade. The business rules for all items have been formulated and approved by the local government for implementation, and there have been no problems over the years. In addition to our association, there are no other organizations with the same nature. There are no business disputes among the various industry associations in the city. The prosperity of the market depends on its maintenance. Since recent years, a small number of our association's members have disobeyed the association's rules and seem to want to split the association, intending to separately form associations for tung oil, raw lacquer, and cattle hides, restricting our association's members from exporting and exclusively allowing them to purchase, transport, and export in order to manipulate market prices and monopolize business. They are now actively working to make this happen. The entire organization and the entire association's business will be torn apart. I and others are responsible and dare not remain silent. We hereby list the facts and request instructions: (1) After the establishment of a legally organized association, its business scope and rules have been submitted and approved by the local government. When other later associations have disputes over its business, according to the legal regulations, does the business belong to the first established association or the later established association? (2) After the establishment of a complete trade association of buyers, sellers, and brokers who are intermediaries in the same business, can they legally form separate trade associations for buyers, sellers, and brokers? If the law stipulates that separate associations cannot be formed, how should the already established association be requested to dissolve its organization? (3) In terms of both facts and law, the organization of its business cannot be allowed (such as when there is already an association with the same nature established earlier in the same area). However, due to temporary approval from the party headquarters and the local government, or the party headquarters and the local government are unaware of the actual situation, they issued organizational certificates and approved registration. How should the legally related trade associations request revocation and appeal to which level of party and government agencies, and what are the procedures? The above three items are all related to the interpretation of laws and regulations. We respectfully request clear instructions. If you would like to submit it to the Ministry of Industry for detailed explanation one by one so that we can follow, we would be grateful. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce of the Republic of China, respectfully."</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Reduced Telegraph Rates, Effective September 1st</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications instructed the Telegraph Bureau yesterday to investigate that our country's telegraph rates were previously divided into intra-provincial and inter-provincial. Since October 17, the current national uniform rates have been adopted, regardless of intra-provincial or inter-provincial, the same fees are charged. Although it is simple and convenient, since our country is vast, it is somewhat unfair to charge the same fees for telegrams sent to various places. Now, in order to facilitate people's communication and develop the telegraph bureau's business, the domestic telegraph rates have been revised as follows: (1) Domestic telegraph rates are divided into intra-provincial and inter-provincial. Ordinary telegrams in Chinese and vernacular language are 7 cents per word intra-provincial and 10 cents per word inter-provincial. (2) The regulations for reducing the fees for the name and address of the recipient of Chinese telegrams, which were implemented in January 23, stipulate that the name and address of the recipient, if not exceeding 15 words, will only be charged for 5 words, which is very convenient for people to send telegrams. However, this method, regardless of the number of words, charges for 5 words for those within 15 words, which is also not very fair. Now, the above method is revised and stipulated that the name and address of the recipient of all kinds of Chinese telegrams, except for those who use telegram registration numbers instead, will still be handled according to the telegram registration regulations. All will be charged as one word for every two words. If there is a remainder of less than two words, it will also be charged as one word. The revised rates and methods opened in the above two items have been approved by the Executive Yuan for record, and will be implemented from September 1, 25th year of the Republic. All relevant Articles 64, 82, and 84 of the domestic telegraph business regulations have also been revised and announced by the Ministry. In addition to the Ministry reprinting the domestic telegraph business regulations and the domestic telegraph rate list, which will be sent separately after printing, the revised articles of the domestic telegraph business regulations are attached for your compliance, and you are instructed to instruct all affiliated agencies and business offices to comply, prepare properly, and implement on schedule.</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Telegraph Bureau heard that it has begun preparations and will implement it on schedule. From now on, the public will use telegrams and pay lower fees than the current rates. For example, sending to Zhonghua Bookstore in Hangzhou costs a total of 8 words. Zhonghua Bookstore in Hangzhou will be charged as 3 words, and "goods stop" will be charged as 2 words, costing a total of 35 cents. According to the current rates, Zhonghua Bookstore in Hangzhou must pay 5 words for 6 words, plus "goods stop" 2 words, totaling 7 words, which should cost 70 cents. Also, sending to Zhonghua Bookstore in Shanghai will also reduce the current rate by 20 cents.</p>

<h3>Qiongya Agricultural Expert Wu Xianshou Returns South Today, Invented Many New Agricultural Tools, Has Been Submitted to the Ministry of Industry for Patent Review</h3>
<p>Hainan agricultural expert Mr. Wu Xianshou came to Shanghai in May of this year for inspection. He visited major factories in the area, such as the China Iron Works, Shanghai Machine Factory, Kangyuan Can Factory, Tang Shenming Charcoal Machine Factory, China Oil Lamp Factory, and Shenchang Foreign Company Machine Factory. There were no fewer than 30 related to agriculture and rural areas. After the visits, Mr. Wu contributed his personal opinions one by one, which were well received. Mr. Wu himself has applied for a patent for many new agricultural tools suitable for practical use in rural China, which he has researched for more than ten years. The application is currently under review by the Ministry of Industry. Mr. Wu believes that the mission of this trip has been completed, and the affairs of the Hainan Animal and Plant Company that he runs need to be taken care of personally. He is scheduled to return south by boat on the 29th. A reporter met Mr. Wu at his residence yesterday. According to the conversation, he originally planned to return south in a short period after coming to Shanghai for inspection. However, it happened that local people in Haikou were preparing for a conference of the Youth Association. Therefore, I contacted the National Youth Association nearby to discuss everything, so the stay in Shanghai was slightly longer. Now that the matter has been completed, the affairs of the Hainan Animal and Plant Company that I run need to be taken care of, so I plan to return immediately. During this trip to Shanghai, I visited more than 30 important factories and received a warm reception, for which I am extremely grateful. The equipment and manufacturing of the factories in this area have tended towards modernization. For example, the Kangyuan Can Factory is very large in scale, and the treatment of employees is similar to that of the Ford factory in the United States. Everything in other factories is also excellent, which shows that the future of China's industry is very hopeful. I am very happy. In the future, agriculture and industry will support each other, and economic revival will not be difficult. Mr. Wu also said that Qiongya is the only place in China with tropical products, and its reserves are extremely rich. If it is slightly developed, it will be effective. I hope that Chinese people will pay attention to the development of Qiongya to avoid the country's resources being abandoned on the ground or even spied on by others.</p>

He visited Russia, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy to inspect the current situation of industry and steel industry. He was welcomed by the governments and industrialists of these countries.

<h3>Sino-American Trade Association Re-elects President and Committee Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai established the Sino-American Trade Association two years ago to expand Sino-American trade. Now, because the original committee members have either taken office in the capital or have been transferred to other places, they have been re-elected.

<h3>Establishing a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau: Soliciting Opinions from Rice Merchants</h3>
<p>A report from the Da Gong News Agency states that the Ministry of Industry, with the intention of balancing domestic agricultural product transportation and sales, has been planning the establishment of a Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau for a long time. Due to various factors, implementation has been delayed. When Director Wu Dingchang of the Ministry of Industry was in Shanghai overseeing the affairs of the Agricultural Foundation Bureau, he took the opportunity to discuss the establishment of this bureau with Gu Xinyi, a leading figure among rice merchants. He also inquired about the reasons for the suspension of preparations for the government-supervised, merchant-operated Nine Provinces and Cities Grain Bureau from the previous year. Furthermore, he contacted key trade associations to establish the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau, with the participation of merchant shares from the rice merchants' side, in order to prepare for the undertaking through joint cooperation between the government and merchants.</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Groups Hold Meetings to Discuss: Gu was extremely supportive of Minister Wu's proposal at the time, but recognized the gravity of the matter and could not respond immediately. He therefore promised to convene a meeting of fellow traders to discuss it. The Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association recently held separate plenary sessions of their executive and supervisory committees. At the meetings, Gu gave a detailed report on the discussions with the Director, but did not put forward concrete proposals for discussion. Because this matter concerns the interests of all traders, a special representative conference will be convened soon to discuss concrete measures.</p>
<p>Grain Company Unlikely to Materialize: Regarding previous rumors that major rice merchants in this city were jointly investing in the organization of a large-scale grain company, the Da Gong News Agency reporter has been inquiring with reliable sources in recent days. The consensus is that the industry is currently relatively stable, and business operations are progressing smoothly. Setting up another grain company would be redundant and might lead to open and covert conflicts among traders. Moreover, in recent years, agricultural products have faced difficulties in finding outlets, prices have been low, and financial problems have made turnover difficult. It is anticipated that there is no good prospect for the future. Therefore, this organization is not likely to materialize in the short term.</p>
<p>Warehouses in Various Locations to Store Autumn Harvest: The National Economic Council and the Ministry of Finance are constructing agricultural product warehouses in Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Changsha, Hankou, and other locations where agricultural products are concentrated. Construction is expected to be completed next month, with a decision to purchase and store grain during this year's autumn harvest. The equipment in these warehouses is part of a preliminary plan to control grain.</p>

<p>Hope for a Bumper Harvest: Rural areas in various regions of our country, in view of the double disasters of floods and droughts last year and the poor harvest in the autumn, had no choice but to purchase and consume foreign rice, resulting in a huge drain of resources. Therefore, this year, they have sincerely accepted the guidance of the Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute of the National Economic Council, improved planting methods, and, in addition, the rainfall in the summer has been even, and the growth of rice seedlings has been extremely rapid.

<h3>Shaanxi and Guizhou Included in Unified Tax Area: Effective from September 1st</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a circular stating: (1) Regarding merchants transporting and selling cigarettes in Shaanxi Province, the former Unified Tax Bureau issued an order in February of the 20th year of the Republic that all cigarettes must pay the unified tax and affix sufficient stamps before being allowed to be transported.

It has also been decided that from September 1st of this year, the province will be declared a unified tax area. The Ministry has telegraphed the provincial government to ensure that from that date, no further taxes or donations will be levied on cigarettes entering or passing through the province that have already paid the unified tax and affixed sufficient stamps. In addition to separate telegrams, the bureau is hereby ordered to inform its subordinates to comply accordingly. Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. (2) Regarding cigarettes in Guizhou Province, the Ministry of Finance has ordered that the unified tax will be implemented from September 1st of this year. The province should be immediately included in the unified tax area.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Request for Stamp Tax on Temporary Silver and Cash Receipts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to inquire whether temporary silver and cash receipts should be subject to stamp tax. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued approval No. 10515 of the Tax Affairs Department, stating: "The Geng Dai telegram has been noted. It is an established principle of stamp tax that a certificate should not be taxed twice. However, many stores issue a so-called 'temporary receipt' after receiving silver and cash, without affixing a stamp. Over the years, these receipts are not collected and exchanged for formal receipts. When they are detected and subject to a fine, they claim to be temporary receipts in an attempt to be clever. The tax exemption column in item 2 of the stamp tax rate table does not stipulate that temporary receipts are exempt from stamping. This is the reason. As for the permit for commercial registration issued by the government, a formal permit must be exchanged after a considerable period of time, which is different from the above situation. The request to be exempt from stamping should not be considered." This approval.</p>

<h3>Please Use Domestically Produced Mao Bian Paper for National Election Ballots: Request from Shanghai Citizens Chen Xing-sun and Others: To Set an Example, Promote Domestic Products, and Cultivate the National Foundation</h3>
<p>Shanghai citizens Chen Xing-sun, Feng Yangqing, and others, in view of the upcoming election of representatives to the National Assembly and the vast amount of paper needed for ballots, telegraphed the Nanjing National Election Headquarters requesting the use of domestically produced Mao Bian paper to save resources and support domestic products. The original text is as follows: (Omitted honorifics) With the election of representatives to the National Assembly imminent, a vast amount of paper is needed for the ballots. We have heard that foreign newsprint may be used for printing. Upon hearing this, we felt it was absolutely unacceptable. The government has repeatedly emphasized the promotion of domestic products, and the election of National Assembly representatives is a major national event. Using foreign newsprint for the ballots is not only contrary to the government's policy of promoting domestic products, but also encourages the people to become accustomed to using foreign products. Moreover, since the ballots are written on one side, it is easier to dry when writing on domestically produced Mao Bian paper. Even considering the price of newsprint, which costs 3.30 yuan per ream, domestically produced Mao Bian paper is only 3.10 yuan per ream, which is more economical. To abandon this economical and suitable domestically produced Mao Bian paper and use foreign newsprint would only cause huge amounts of money to flow to foreign lands, which is contrary to the government's long-standing policy of promoting domestic products and cultivating the national foundation. We dare not remain silent on this humble opinion. Therefore, we appeal to your office to order your subordinates and instruct the organizers to use domestically produced Mao Bian paper for printing the ballots for the National Assembly representatives, in order to maintain domestic products and set an example. We express our urgent request and hope for your kind consideration.</p>

The importance of the Shanghai Local Court's position is therefore evident. President Lu is a talented individual in the legal field and has been appointed to Shanghai for reorganization. Since the revolution, the Shanghai Court has changed presidents six times. There have been instances of leniency and strictness towards subordinates, but excessive leniency may lead to abandonment, while excessive strictness may not foster goodwill among subordinates. One should only focus on the needs of the situation, be diligent and dedicated, and the first principle of work should be to emphasize moral conduct. Judges should aim for integrity and honesty. Honest officials not only sacrifice more, but also should be more cautious in handling documents and avoid carelessness. Therefore, he hopes that President Lu will consistently strive with great fearlessness. Today, Chief Prosecutor Zhu is also taking the oath. Chief Prosecutor Zhu has a good reputation in the judicial field and has also been appointed for reorganization. Therefore, with the cooperation of both, the future is sure to be bright. Oath administrator Sun Honglin delivered a speech, stating that the appointments of President Lu and Chief Prosecutor Zhu were announced one month apart.

<h3>The Unidentified Male Corpse in Wuxi Almost Resulted in a Wrongful Conviction: Yu Lili Was Wrongfully Imprisoned, Wu Piaoping Stepped Forward to Reveal the Truth</h3>
<p>Wu Piaoping, secretary of the Shanghai Sutain Opera Research Association (originally named Zhang Zishi, from Dachang Township in northern Shanghai, 40 years old), is usually involved in Sutain Opera performances, so he is very familiar with the leading actors. When Wuxi Great World opened, Wu was invited by Yang Liansheng to Wuxi to perform Sutain Opera. Wu introduced Shi Xiangyun and Yu Lili (also known as Xiao Wawa, wife of Yu Ruixiang) to join and perform together. Later, because Shi and Yu competed for the top billing, disputes arose, and Wu was severely criticized. On the 8th of this month, wearing a vest, he left without saying goodbye, traveled from Wuxi to Suzhou, borrowed travel expenses from a friend, took a car to Shanghai, and returned to his home in Dachang Township. Unexpectedly, on the 13th, an unidentified male corpse with knife wounds was discovered in Xiadian Township, Wuxi. People suspected that the corpse was the missing Wu Piaoping, leading to Yu Lili being suspected of murder. She was arrested by the Wuxi Court, causing a stir in the city. Wu, residing in the countryside, eventually found it unsustainable and took a car to Shanghai to borrow travel expenses from Zhu Guoliang, a famous Sutain Opera performer living in Baokang Lane, Beijing Road, intending to seek work elsewhere. At that time, Yu's mother, Xu, entrusted a friend, Wu Shutang, to come to Shanghai to inquire about Wu's whereabouts from Zhu (because Zhu was a friend of Wu). Thus, Wu and Wu met. Wu Shutang told him about the suspected murder case in Wuxi. Wu Piaoping then traveled with Wu Shutang by car to Wuxi overnight to explain the facts to the court. After questioning by the prosecutor, Yu was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Slum Dwellers Association Asks the Municipal Council to Build Public Housing Quickly, Expressing Improved Living Conditions, Five Resolutions Were Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Slum Dwellers Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating that slum dwellers are a special group of impoverished people who cannot afford to rent houses and can only build simple shacks to temporarily shelter from the wind and rain. They go out to work hard during the day and stay in the shacks at night to barely survive their poverty-stricken lives. Since your esteemed council has proposed the limited demolition of slums, we have been greatly shocked. As far as the daily life of our slum dwellers is concerned, it is already difficult and precarious. If we are forced to relocate again, we will be displaced, and the misery will be unbearable to witness. We believe that the council's desire to demolish slums is based on concerns about urban appearance and hygiene. However, in today's situation, the economic downturn is shaking the entire city. Even prosperous areas such as Nanjing Road and Avenue Edward VII are seeing an increasing number of vacant houses. Notices of clearance and court seals are visible everywhere. This is actually the biggest damage to the city's appearance, which your council has not yet taken into account. Furthermore, after the demolition of our slums, we will not be able to afford to rent houses and will inevitably wander the streets, sleeping anywhere. This is the opposite of your council's desire to improve the city's appearance. In terms of hygiene, our slum dwellers are also aware and will automatically carry out tasks such as cleaning dirt and dredging ditches, in order to gradually improve hygiene matters. We believe that the municipal authorities should take into account the needs of all citizens in the area and provide universal protection. Our slum dwellers are ignorant and foolish, but they work hard and serve in urban construction. Even if we dare not claim credit, we have done no wrong. At this time of economic depression and increasing hardship, we are terrified to hear of the demolition order. Our association is entrusted by slum dwellers in various districts to improve the lives of slum dwellers. For the sake of the livelihoods of the poor and the appearance and hygiene of the city, we have made the following resolutions: (1) In the future, our slum dwellers will automatically limit and not increase the number of slums. (2) If the landlord builds houses or the Municipal Council needs to open roads, the slum dwellers will immediately relocate. (3) Comply with the guidance of the municipal authorities to improve sanitation facilities. (4) Request the Municipal Council to revoke the demolition order to ensure a livelihood. (5) Request the Municipal Council to allocate funds as soon as possible to build public housing to accommodate the poor, in order to eliminate slums in phases. All cases have been recorded. This matter concerns the life and death of our slum dwellers and we cannot remain silent. We specially send this letter to you, respectfully requesting that you consider the economic depression and the suffering of the poor, and approve the adoption of our foolish suggestions and implement them separately. We will be deeply grateful. Addressed to the Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Banks and Native Banks Meeting to Unify Public Records of Real Estate: Time: August 31st; Location: Ningbo Road Native Bankers Association</h3>
<p>Xinzheng News: The Unified Public Records, jointly organized by Fuyuan Native Bank and Kenye Bank, etc., with more than seventy firms, operate the real estate of the Shenzhou Inn on Fuzhou Road.

The Shanghai Native Bankers Association, upon the request of its members and the resolution of the Executive Committee, has approved the convening of a meeting of bondholders at 2:00 PM on August 31st at the association on Ningbo Road to decide the matter. The notice was issued yesterday. A reporter from Xinsheng News stated that the Shenzhou Inn property originally belonged to real estate merchant Cheng Linsheng. It was mortgaged to more than seventy banks and native banks. When it expired, it could not be repaid, so it was sold at a price to the mortgagee banks and native banks, which formed a Unified Public Records to operate it.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cultural Relics Exhibition: New Display of Exquisite Items</h3>

<h3>Shen Weizhi Discovered Stone Tools in Huzhou, Lent Them to the Wuyue History and Geography Society for Exhibition, Counting Dozens of Items</h3>
<p>The Wuyue History and Geography Society, presided over by Wei Juxian, will hold an exhibition soon. It is said that dozens of stone tools will be among them, which were collected by Shen Weizhi, secretary-general of the business school in the downtown area of ​​Shanghai University, and temporarily co-exhibited. According to Shen Weizhi, a total of forty-eight items were lent to the Wuyue History and Geography Society, including a complete stone awl, seven complete stone arrowheads, eleven incomplete ones, seven complete stone coins, one stone axe, one stone yue, fourteen broken stone tools, and four broken copper pieces. These stone tools were all collected by Shen in his hometown of Huzhou, near the Qianshanyang Lake Beach. Shen has been very interested in these antiquities since he was a child, so he has repeatedly collected and researched them, with unique insights. The above-mentioned dozens of newly acquired items were all collected from 1934 to the present. It is said that the collected objects are all newly unearthed. According to research, the oldest ones are from the late Shang and early Zhou dynasties. This type of discovery is of great significance to Chinese culture. Whether the source of Chinese culture is from south to north or from north to south has become a topic of discussion for those who pay attention to this issue. However, the discovery of these historical antiquities in Huzhou will help provide new materials for research. This discovery also shows that there have been major changes in the geographical situation of China over the past 5,000 years. Therefore, although not many items have been collected, their value is very high. Shen still has many scattered unearthed ancient stone tools and other collections, but their historical value is shallow, so they are not mentioned. It is said that Shen is still working hard to collect them, and it is expected that there will be new discoveries in the future, which will make a significant contribution to academics.</p>

<h3>Lu Jingshi Mediates: Rent Reduction in Nine Mu Area</h3>
<p>More than 300 new residential buildings in various lanes of the nine mu area on Minquan Road and Renyi Jizhiren Road in Lushang Garden of Shanghai belong to the property of Anhe Company. Since the entry of special business owners into the area, the market has become prosperous. However, merchants who rent there often bear high rents, and are extorted for tips and bad rules by the rental agency office when they move in, ranging from thousands of yuan to at least several hundred yuan. Therefore, the public was indignant and jointly presented a petition to the South District Rent Reduction Association for justified negotiation. Now, Mr. Lu Jingshi has been appointed as mediator. After Anhe Company suspended the rental agency office that collected tips for thorough investigation, it also reduced the original rent of 1100 yuan per double building to 77.5 yuan to accommodate the difficulties of the merchants. The general merchants heard that the house prices there are cheaper than in remote areas, and it is also suitable for opening shops and living at home. Therefore, only a few houses are left in the more than 300 residential buildings. It is also learned that Anhe Company has issued a notice that merchants who want to rent there must not pay tips again. If the rental agency office deliberately makes things difficult, they can directly report to the company for strict punishment, to eliminate bad rules and create a new example for renting houses in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Two Major Tobacco Companies Cooperate to Issue Cool Cigarettes</h3>
<p>The Cool Cigarettes manufactured by the Huamei Tobacco Company are very popular among people from all walks of life.

In order to respect central laws and improve commercial ethics, it has automatically stopped manufacturing. Huafie, on the other hand, believes that commercial warfare cannot be allowed internally, and sincere unity is obligatory. Therefore, the leaders of the two companies feel that cooperation is necessary. After recent discussions between the two parties, it was decided to cooperate in issuing cool cigarettes. Huafie manufactures the "Asiko" trademark, and Huamei manufactures the "Misigan" trademark. The quality is consistent and exceptionally elegant.

<h3>Boxing Master Accused of Enticing Away a Friend's Wife and Daughter: The Beiping Public Security Bureau Asks Shanghai to Assist in the Arrest: The Three Have Been Captured on Dagu Road</h3>
<p>Guan Mingyuan, who lives at No. 48 Dashiqiao, Beiping, cohabited with his wife, Ms. Liu (32 years old, from Beiping). In the beginning, their relationship was fairly harmonious. They had a daughter, aged 13, named Yanqin. In the first month of this year, Tian Yu, a Beiping native who worked as a boxing master, had stayed at Guan's home because he and Guan were from the same hometown and were friends. At the beginning of February, Tian left Beiping for Shanghai and took a job at a certain institution, still working as a boxing master. However, Guan's wife, Ms. Liu, suddenly claimed that she could not bear her husband's abuse four days after Tian left, and took her clothes and 380 yuan in cash, and took her daughter Guan Yanqin away without saying goodbye, disappearing without a trace. Guan Mingyuan reported it to the local Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. For several months, there was no news. Until recently, Guan learned that his wife had fled to Shanghai and was cohabiting with Tian Yu at No. 167 Dagu Road in the Public Concession. He reported it to the Beiping Public Security Bureau, which sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. At 9:50 PM the night before, two detectives, No. 107 and No. 113, reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station and assisted Chinese and foreign detectives in arresting Tian Yu, Guan Ms. Liu, and Guan Yanqin together at No. 167 Dagu Road and detaining them in the police station for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the 8th Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation. Then, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau filed a case and requested transfer, claiming that he had not prepared official documents due to the short time. Tian Yu only admitted to staying temporarily at Guan Mingyuan's house in Beiping and denied instigating Ms. Liu to abscond. Guan Ms. Liu confessed that she could not bear to live with her husband because of his abuse, so she had no choice but to take her daughter to Shanghai in early February, seek refuge with Tian Yu's family for temporary residence, and seek Tian's help to find ways to maintain a living, and there was no improper behavior. Judge Huang Risheng checked the confession and instructed that Tian Yu and others should still be detained separately until the official documents from the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrive next Monday for further verification.</p>

<h3>All Customs Child Servants Plead Not to Be Dismissed: Six Have Been Replaced by New Servants: The Entire Group is Panicked and Appeals to the Customs</h3>
<p>Datong News: Regarding the rumors circulating outside about the dismissal of the Jianghai Customs child servants, a reporter from Datong News learned yesterday morning that the matter is still under discussion and may be resolved. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Brief History of Child Servants: There are currently a total of thirty-three child servants in the Jianghai Customs. They were all hired after passing the shipowner's office examination. It is said that when they were hired, there was a fixed employment period of three years, but it was also said that if their service performance was good, they could be continuously employed. The salary of these child servants is uniformly 16 yuan per month. Among the thirty-three who passed the exam at that time, about ten have been dismissed by the Customs in the past three years, and new child servants have been recruited to supplement them.</p>
<p>Cause of Fermentation: The cause of this turmoil was due to the Customs' past decision to dismiss child servants. Before the official announcement, new child servants must be assigned to replace the duties of the old child servants. Recently, the six child servants of (1) the dispatch room, (2) the customs warehouse, (3) the third section, (4) the fourth section, (5) the visa station, and (6) the signing station have been replaced by new child servants assigned by the customs.</p>
<p>Please Do Not Dismiss: The other child servants, considering that the three-year service period of the majority has expired, and feeling sympathetic, jointly elected representatives to request the customs authorities to exempt them from dismissal. However, the authorities have not expressed any opinion. According to the child servants, their duties are only to sweep, run errands, and deliver documents. As for the reports, they are locked into the safe by the customs officers before being handed over to the child servants for delivery to various departments. Therefore, even if they serve in the customs for life, it is absolutely impossible for them to cheat. Some say that child servants who have served for too long are prone to corruption, but they do not understand the situation.</p>
<h3>Special Edition on Sichuan Opera: Accused of Defamation</h3>
<p>Shi Chunxuan, a native of Shanghai, age 36, a comedian and standing committee member of the Shanghai Opera Research Association, residing at No. 1, Shen Yu Lane, Huacheng Road, French Concession, through lawyer Jin Yan, filed a suit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Lu Hancheng, a Sichuanese and manager of the Sichuan Grand Stage at the Xinguang Grand Theater on Ningbo Road, Public Concession, and publisher of the Sichuan Opera Special, along with Sun Jiayu (age 23, from Chengdu, residing at the Sichuan Opera Special office, No. 66, Songshan Road, French Concession) and Liu Zuoxiang (age 32, Sichuanese, residing with Sun Jiayu), of defamation. The indictment states that on August 5, the first day of publication of the Sichuan Opera Special, it contained statements such as "Sichuan opera does not involve absurdity or obscenity, and will definitely not cater to the general social psychology like the current Shanghai opera and other local operas, forgetting the mission of dramatic education." Members of the Shanghai Opera Research Association believe that the Sichuan Opera Special intentionally slandered and defamed the reputation of the entire Shanghai opera community. After deliberation, the association decided to appoint Shi Chunxuan to file the lawsuit, requesting the court to investigate according to law. Upon receiving the indictment, the court, yesterday afternoon, dispatched Judge Sun Peng to the Second Criminal Court to summon the defendants. The plaintiff, Shi Chunxuan, arrived with his lawyer and presented his case. The first defendant, Lu Hancheng, was absent due to illness. The second and third defendants, Sun Jiayu and Liu Zuoxiang, arrived with their defense lawyer. According to Sun and Liu, Sichuan opera has not been in Shanghai for long. Due to language barriers, this special edition was published to facilitate research for fellow villagers and spectators and to improve the quality of performances. It is no different from a prospectus. The Shanghai opera and other local operas mentioned in the special edition are abstract terms and do not specifically refer to the Shanghai Opera Research Association or Shi personally. There is no defamation. We hope to improve drama to fulfill its educational mission. We are new to Shanghai, have no animosity towards the Shi family, and have no grievances with the Shanghai Opera Research Association. How could we harm their reputation? Judge Sun, after reviewing the testimonies, believed that the case was clear. After arguments, he declared the hearing closed and scheduled the verdict for September 2.</p>

<h3>Another Lawsuit Against Tongyi Trust Company: Lu Tangcha and Others Representing Over 300 Households, Court Hearing Adjourned</h3>
<p>Since the Tongyi Trust Company suddenly collapsed and declared bankruptcy on June 16 of this year, depositors and those who entrusted the company with the safekeeping of government bonds have accused the company of illegal activities. They have filed lawsuits with the First Special Court against the directors and supervisors of Tongyi Company, and sentences have been handed down. These matters have been reported in this newspaper. Recently, Lu Tangcha, Ying Shugui, Wang Meiqing, and others, representing over 300 depositors, have separately hired lawyers Zhang Yifan and Chen Changsheng, as well as accountant Ma Qichang, to file a lawsuit against</p>
<p>Huang Suchu, director and general manager of Tongyi Company, and directors Liu Fangyuan, Xu Jiyi, Zhou Shouliang, Guo Yushang, Liu Rensan, Xiong Muqu, and supervisors Jiang Yizhi, Chuan Zhu Yin, and Wu Jingwen, for violating Articles 231, 232, and 233 of the Company Law, and Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Savings Bank Law. In addition to requesting legal punishment, they also attached a civil suit, requesting that the defendants and Tongyi Company be jointly responsible for repaying 176,004.67 yuan in national currency. The case has been heard once, but due to the absence of the defendants, it was ordered to be rescheduled. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao</p>
<p>presided over the Fifth Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Only Xu Jiyi, Guo Yushang, Zhou Shouliang, and Fu Zhu Yin among the defendants appeared in court with defense lawyers Xu Shihao and Zuo De. The others were absent. According to the testimony of the four defendants present, they generally did not deny their positions as directors and supervisors, but claimed that they were not very familiar with the company's internal affairs. The company did not provide detailed reports during board meetings, so the truth of the plaintiffs' claims was unclear. Judge Ye then commenced the arguments. The plaintiff's lawyer then detailed the defendants' violations</p>
<p>of the Company Law, stating that the credit and mortgage loans in the asset section of the 1932-34 balance sheets included 978,000 yuan loaned to the Changzhou Tongcheng Yarn Factory and 300,000 yuan loaned to the former Beijing government's Ministry of Finance, all of which were long-term bad debts with no hope of recovery. These were listed as assets to deceive depositors, which constitutes a violation of Article 231, Paragraph 6 of the Company Law. Furthermore, the company's paid-up capital was 1.36 million yuan, and the aforementioned bad debts alone amounted to over one million yuan. This means that before this year,</p>
<p>the remaining capital was only 82,000 yuan. According to the Company Law, if a company's losses reach one-third of its total capital, the directors should immediately convene a shareholders' meeting to report the situation. Although the defendants convened a shareholders' meeting and distributed dividends, they continued to obscure the company's losses, which constitutes a violation of Article 232, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law. Furthermore, if the company's assets are clearly insufficient to cover its debts, the directors should immediately apply for bankruptcy. Since the Changzhou Tongcheng Company's bankruptcy in 1933 resulted in a loss of 978,000 yuan in loans, the company's assets had been depleted three years ago and were insufficient</p>
<p>to cover its debts. This fact was obvious, but the defendants did not apply for bankruptcy according to law, which constitutes a violation of Article 232, Paragraph 7 of the Company Law. Moreover, the savings deposit regulations published by the company in January 1927 stated that the total paid-up capital was 1.7 million yuan, while the asset-liability statement for the 1935 financial year showed a change to 1.36 million yuan, a difference of 340,000 yuan. This indicates that the total amount of paid-up capital was falsely stated when applying for registration, which constitutes a violation of Article 233, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law. Furthermore, according to</p>
<p>Article 8 of the Savings Bank Law, the amount of deposits a savings bank places in other banks shall not exceed one-fifteenth of its total deposits. A review of the defendants' 1935 asset-liability statement shows that the savings department's income was 2,269,942.52 yuan, while the total amount deposited in other banks reached 183,440.41 yuan, exceeding one-fifteenth of the total. Therefore, we request that they be punished according to law and that the civil suit for 176,004.67 yuan be attached. The defendants' defense lawyers then rose to reply, stating that although the defendants present were</p>
<p>nominally directors or supervisors, they were not actually familiar with the company's internal details or the detailed accounts, nor were they executive directors in charge of operations. Therefore, in addition to pleading not guilty, they questioned whether the plaintiff's representatives present were authorized by the claimed 300-plus people, and whether there were authorization letters and supporting documents, which the defendants were not aware of. This point is procedurally flawed. Judge Ye, noting that the issue of the plaintiff's representatives' qualifications required the plaintiff's lawyer to provide supporting documents, adjourned the case to September 3 for a continued hearing in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, located at No. 20, Masinan Road, French Concession, ordered six water-powered fire extinguishers from the Da Zhongguo Industrial Factory (Note: This factory has not yet registered with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry) at No. 121, Kaifeng Road, Zhabei, at a price of 10 French francs per unit. The factory sent four units through its clerk Qian Jinbao the day before. In the afternoon, the factory owner, Tang Yangchun, personally delivered the remaining two units. When Tang was installing and testing them, one of the fire extinguishers suddenly exploded for unknown reasons, causing a deafening boom and scattering metal fragments. The explosion injured Zheng Zhaonian, an employee of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, and a watchman, Fang, No. 192, in the head. They were immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Public Bus Causes Accident: One Woman Killed, Two Rickshaw Pullers Detained, Bus Driver Also Responsible</h3>
<p>At 11:50 PM the night before, a public bus collided with two rickshaws at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, resulting in the death of a female passenger, Wang Aifen (age 22, from Suzhou, residing at No. 3, Rongkang Lane, Muer Ming Road). According to the police investigation, three rickshaws were traveling side by side from east to west when the accident occurred. The rickshaw occupied by the deceased was pulled by Wu Yuru from Jiangbei, positioned on the outermost side. As they passed the intersection, Li Baofu, also from Jiangbei, attempted to overtake the three vehicles, and a British-owned double-decker bus, No. 15092, driven by Yu Rixian, was speeding towards them. Unable to avoid the collision, the bus struck Li's rickshaw, flipping it over. The driver then turned the bus outwards, but the front of the bus struck the rickshaw pulled by Wu Yuru, flipping it over and injuring Wang. Two Westerners driving by in a car immediately sent Wang to Guangci Hospital, but she died from her injuries at 3:00 AM the next morning. The police, believing that Wu Yuru and Li Baofu were negligent, detained them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case and requested that Wu and Li be temporarily detained. Li Baofu testified that there were no three rickshaws traveling side by side. Judge Huang Yuesheng, after reviewing the testimonies, ordered that Wu and Li be detained until next Thursday. Prosecutor Tang from the First Special Court arrived at the center and examined the body. According to the police report, the deceased had been out with her boyfriend, Liang Hebing, from the International Hotel. Liang has now gone to Hong Kong. The deceased's brother, Wang Boying, a secretary in the Shanghai Municipal Government, strongly criticized the public bus driver, Yu Rixian, stating that Yu had conjunctivitis, his eyes were red and swollen, and he did not use the horn. He requested an investigation. Yu Rixian also admitted that he did not use the horn at the time. The police stated that they would conduct a thorough investigation of the case. Prosecutor Tang ruled that the deceased, Wang Aifen, died from injuries sustained in the bus collision. The body was released to her brother, Wang Boying, for burial. The case should be further investigated in detail by the responsible police station.</p>
<h3>Gambling Leads to Homicide: Suspect Awaits Sentencing</h3>
<p>Weng Zhi, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 10, Yuanfang Lane, Yuanfang Road, worked as a porter at the Jardine Matheson Wharf. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, around 8:00 PM, he was gambling with Wang Along (a peddler from Ningbo) as a pastime. Wang lost, and after settling accounts with a local beggar, he owed Weng 7 dimes. He paid 8 dimes, but Weng demanded 10 more copper coins, leading to an argument. Weng angrily slapped Wang once on the ear and left. Wang was very unhappy and waited for Weng on Yuanfang Road, McTaggart Road. When Weng arrived, Wang dragged him and punched and kicked him in the chest and abdomen. Weng fell to the ground, and Wang took the opportunity to escape. Weng Zhi was sent to the Jardine Matheson Workshop at No. 351 Broadway Road by fellow villagers Huang Jiaxu and Lin Rizhong. He died at 7:00 AM on the 15th. The Hongkou police station was notified and sent detective Zhao Ziqian to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road. A prosecutor from the First Special District Court arrived and ordered a forensic examination. The body was released to his wife, Yang, for burial. The suspect, Wang Along, was apprehended by detective Zhao on Minguo Road in the French Concession at 5:45 PM on the 17th and sent to the court for detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei opened the Third Criminal Court for trial. The official stated that the forensic examination revealed that Weng Zhi died from a ruptured intestine in the abdomen. According to the statement from Weng's wife, Yang, her husband told her before his death that he was beaten by Wang Along. Witnesses Huang Jiaxu and Lin Rizhong testified that they witnessed Wang Along beating Weng Zhi. They did not see Weng slap Wang during the gambling. The two beggars testified that Wang Along lost 4 dimes to Weng and 3 dimes to them. There was a settlement of accounts, but they did not know about the fight. Wang Along insisted that Weng should not have slapped him and said disrespectful things. Therefore, he became angry and caused the tragedy. It was not intentional and he asked for leniency. After Judge Xiao appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant and the Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, to argue, the judge ordered that he be remanded in custody to await sentencing.</p>

This campaign aims to concentrate public strength to assist the government, strengthen national defense, and develop civil aviation. It has been supported and praised by all parties, and the enthusiasm and perseverance are admirable. The reported membership of each team is over 15,000 people, and the membership fees and donations amount to 290,000 yuan, which has been submitted to the General Association's Fund Management Committee. The headquarters will notify the fundraising teams that have not yet concluded to end their fundraising work by the end of this month, and to submit their achievements and fundraising documents to the office for statistics and publication. The fundraising for national aviation funds by various trade associations is progressing smoothly and the results are good. The campaign to purchase aircraft as a gift to the government for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, initiated by this association, has been enthusiastically supported and generously contributed by all parties, aiming to expand the national aviation movement and show respect for the leader. Following this, various field directors reported on the progress of liaison and inspection, and discussed multiple fundraising plans before adjourning the meeting.</p>

<h3>The Labor Strike at the British-American Tobacco Factory Remains Unresolved: Party and Government Agencies Thoroughly Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, over 2,600 male and female workers at the British-American Tobacco Company's Third Factory (now renamed Yizhong Tobacco Company) at No. 674, Huade Road, Taopeng Road, staged a strike on the morning of the 18th of this month in protest of the factory's unwarranted dismissal of female workers and dissatisfaction with the Chinese manager, Wei Ziqian. Six representatives were elected by the workers to negotiate with the Western director, Huisi Buke, and presented two demands. After Huisi responded, the workers agreed to return to work on the 23rd of this month (Monday). However, some workers expressed that they would not return to work unless the manager was dismissed, due to his usual mistreatment of workers. The stalemate has continued for ten days without a resolution. The local party and government agencies believe that the labor strike has created a deadlock that is critical to local security and the workers' livelihoods. Therefore, they have dispatched personnel to investigate the truth and will schedule mediation to prevent the dispute from escalating.</p>

<h3>Record of Our National Athletes' Participation (Letter 10) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen</h3>
<p>100-Meter Final</p>
<p>The 100-meter final turned into a white-hot bloody battle. It was truly a magnificent spectacle. The two black sprinters fought to the death, thrilling the more than 100,000 spectators in the audience, who were beside themselves with excitement. The six generals who qualified for the final rested for an hour after the semi-finals and took to the field again at 5:00 PM. The audience cheered and applauded thunderously. The six were lined up, with Owens in the first lane, Strömberg in the second, Borchmeyer in the third, Osendarp in the fourth, Wykoff in the fifth, and Metcalfe in the sixth. As they took their positions and prepared to start, the entire audience held their breath and was silent. At the sound of the gun, Owens, Wykoff, and Osendarp moved forward in a line. Metcalfe started more slowly, falling behind by one step. Owens quickened his light pace, sprinting like a fly. At 60 meters, he was one meter ahead of the others.</p>
<p>Metcalfe, who was in fourth place at the time, also quickened his pace, fighting bravely. The competition was fierce. At the finish line, he was only a shoulder behind Owens. Osendarp was half a step behind. Veteran Wykoff's golden age had passed, and he only beat Borchmeyer by a chest to take fourth place. Owens' time was 10.3 seconds, equaling the world record jointly held by Canadian Williams and American Tolan. However, it was still not as fast as his own time of 10.2 seconds in the previous race. This 100-meter race included 12 preliminary races, 4 quarter-final races, 2 semi-final races, and 1 final race. Not a single participant jumped the gun, demonstrating that the world's athletes are extraordinary. The final results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Owens (USA) 10.3 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Metcalfe (USA) 10.4 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Osendarp (Netherlands) 10.5 seconds</p>
<p>(4) Wykoff (USA)</p>
<p>(5) Borchmeyer (France)</p>
<p>(6) Strömberg (Sweden)</p>
<p>Women's 100-Meter Preliminary Races</p>
<p>The women's 100-meter preliminary races were held at 4:00 PM, divided into six groups. Six participants in each, with two qualifying. Our Chinese athlete Li Sen and the defending champion from Poland, Walasiewicz, were in the third group. Although she finished fourth, eight meters behind, she competed fiercely with the other athletes. In the second group, American Stephens ran with great force, with a running style no different from that of a man, achieving a time of 11.4 seconds, breaking her own world record of 11.6 seconds, and finishing 10 meters ahead of second place, astonishing the entire stadium. Few of our male athletes could surpass this excellent result. The results of each group are as follows:</p>

<p>Alpers (France) 12.4 seconds</p>
<p>Jawlak (Austria) 12.5 seconds</p>

<p>The semi-finals were held at 5:30 PM. In the first group, Stephens once again demonstrated her skill. Although she started slowly, she took the lead after 15 meters, opening up her pace like a bird freed from its cage. Her time of 11.5 seconds broke the world record again, finishing about six or seven meters ahead. In the second group, French athlete Dollinger, with her relaxed pace and beautiful posture, beat the defending champion Walasiewicz by a shoulder to take first place, which was a surprise.</p>
<p>Group 1</p>
<p>(1) Stephens 11.5 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Krause 11.9 seconds</p>
<p>(3) Alpers 12.2 seconds</p>

<p>800-Meter Semi-Finals</p>
<p>The 800-meter semi-finals were held at 5:15 PM, divided into three groups, with three from each group qualifying for the final. The United States swept first place in all three groups, demonstrating great strength. Great Britain, which held the middle-distance hegemony, was in a slump, only managing to make the list in the third group, causing a sense of the changing times.

<h3>Securities August Government Bond Four and Its Course</h3>

On the delivery and receiving side, the Sichuan group continued to receive, the financial sector delivered a small amount, and the rest were mostly small investors closing out positions. Among the various bonds, only Type B had more settlements due to the profit from the draw. The other two types, Type C and Type E, accounted for more than 10 million. The course was entirely determined by the high and low market prices, which rose and fell due to changes in the two provinces. The August futures started trading on June 25th, when the events in Guangdong and Guangxi were at their most serious, the situation on the Hunan border was tense, and war was about to break out. Subsequently, the situation gradually eased, the two armies in Guangdong and Guangxi were demobilized, and the market price soared, reaching a new high on July 24th.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market The Yarn Market Remains Sluggish The Lowest Price for October Has Already Been Seen at 195.5</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded at noon. The situation is increasingly spinning. The sales of current yarn are still smooth, and the factory's inventory is relatively low.

However, after falling for several consecutive days, it has reached more than ten yuan, and it may be able to stabilize temporarily.</p>
<h3>Standard Yarn Juxingyu Greatly Shorting</h3>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was bad. Many longs in the cotton market were selling, and Juxingyu was heavily shorting, causing the market to loosen. However, Gengfeng was actively adding positions, and Xincheng's buybacks were also considerable. The market trend remained sluggish, mainly due to the deteriorating situation of raw cotton, and there were more people shorting. As a result, each month fell by 1.2.3.6 jiao from the previous day's closing price.

<p>- Unable to Resist the Massive Selling Pressure from the Longs -</p>
<p>The longs in the cotton market, Yudai and Tongji, were all selling heavily, with particularly large amounts. According to the market, there are still problems with the delivery of August contracts, so the longs are shorting more in October. However, most cotton merchants are actively covering their shorts, and there seems to be a tendency to go long, but the weather is still good.</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Yudai Violently Cuts Longs</h3>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Rise and Fall Differently</h3>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton market opened with each month falling by 1 pound to rising 2 pounds. Early morning trading was sluggish, and market prices were firm. Then, due to good news from Liverpool, foreign merchants purchased and prices rose. Midway, cotton farmers sold, and prices softened slightly. Before the close, shorts covered and traders bought, and prices rose again. There were limited new external accounts. Traders are waiting for European progress and new cotton conditions.

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<h3>Bleached Cloth Sales Decline the Most</h3>
<h3>Sichuan Colored Cloth Sales Turn Around</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, after the continuous decline in standard yarn and cotton, the market was greatly depressed, and each customer group was hesitant to move forward. The East Piece bleached goods, due to the unsteady factory prices and weak sales, and the end of the month has arrived, were all willing to sell. Therefore, the market price of each brand of market cloth, raw cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by another 2.5 fen per piece. The price of the factory's fine cloth and fine twill also fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece. Light and heavy coarse cloth and coarse twill still held their original prices. The ones that were selling the slowest and falling the most were Luan cloths, such as the Lunchang Qiankun Seal, the Qingfeng Juesheng Map, which all fell by 1 jiao per piece. The demand for colored cloth from the Sichuan group has slightly turned around. Yesterday, they packed more than 300 pieces of autumn-colored twill from Dacheng Factory Butterfly Ball, Dacheng Blue Cloth, Yihai Three Peach, Three Deer, Bleached Velvet, and Guangzhong Songhe Printed Velvet. The Hunan group also packed more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, fine twill, tribute silk, serge, and velvet. The Shaanxi, Henan, and Shandong groups also made slight progress in purchasing serge, tribute silk, woolen cloth, velvet, printed satin, tribute silk, and serge from various factories. Due to the constraints of the Guangxi situation in Guangdong and Yunnan, the most needed plain twill was selling poorly, and the selling price continued to decline, and the price was poor, making it difficult to approach the Shanghai market. Various small amounts of colored goods such as printed tribute silk, blue cloth, printed velvet, tribute silk, serge, and woolen cloth were slightly moving. The ports in Zhejiang, Fujian, and the Yangtze River also had small transactions, and were not lonely.</p>
<h3>Grain Actual Sales Are Silent Flour Wants to Rise but Turns Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the morning opening, the market in each month showed a trend of initial strength followed by fatigue. The quotations for foreign wheat were good, with Chicago up 1.2 jiao, and Canada up 3.4 jiao. Therefore, the market sentiment was very stable at the opening, and more than 340,000 bales were bought in each month by off-site longs, causing the market to hold, and the price rose by 12 fen from the previous day. The second trade turned clear, and the market was still stable. The customers all watched and waited, and actual sales were very silent, and the market gradually loosened. When the afternoon market opened, the buyers were even weaker due to the lack of sales from customers. Only more than 100,000 bales were traded in half a day in the afternoon. Therefore, the opening price was declining step by step, falling back by 23 fen from the morning peak. We will wait and see what happens. If actual sales are not active, the near-term market may loosen.</p>
<h3>Period Wheat Is Slack Immediately After Being Smart</h3>
<p>Yesterday's period wheat market, at the opening in the morning, each month showed a slight rise, because foreign wheat quotations continued to be good at 12 jiao to 34 jiao. The market sentiment inside and outside the industry could not help but be active. However, at present, the flour market is not strong, and factories are not immediately separating the existing wheat. Therefore, the opening price is gradually loosening. Therefore, although the market atmosphere is smart, the transaction is unspeakably clear. When the afternoon market opened, the transaction was still rare. Because the flour market was loosening, the market sentiment was also soft, falling back by 34 fen compared to the morning. As a result, there was only a 1 fen difference</p>

<p>On Cultural Aggression, Talking from Shanghai Local Supplements, by Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The "friendly nation's" aggression against our country is multifaceted. Politics, military affairs, economy, and culture are all actively pursued when the opportunity arises. Political and military policies have already achieved considerable results, while the economy is being "promoted." As for culture, there has also been considerable attention paid to it recently. They plan to establish a library in Shanghai one moment, and propose to establish a testing ground in Beiping the next. In short, they try to get their hands on any place that can "promote" culture.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a rumor that the "friendly nation" is opening schools in various parts of our country. The Southern Taiwan Governor's Office has decided to establish a five-year Class A commercial school in Xiamen, enrolling Japanese and Taiwanese youth who aspire to be active in South China and Southeast Asia, teaching them Chinese, and also enrolling Chinese students. In the north, a certain Taiwanese resident in Beiping has contacted a certain cultural organization and some people in Chinese academic circles, planning to set up a Sino-Japanese university there. The establishment funds and foundation will be allocated from the "friendly nation's" unreturned Boxer Indemnity funds.</p>
<p>This is clearly a form of cultural aggression. Recently, the "friendly nation" has been shouting about "Northern Ningbo and Southern Advancement." Opening a commercial school in Xiamen is a preparation for "Southern Advancement." In order to implement the Southern Advancement policy, they are vigorously encouraging Taiwanese to immigrate to South China. Now, by training a group of "vanguards" who aspire to be active in South China and Southeast Asia, the force of aggression will be even greater. The "friendly nation" has established a commercial school in Shanghai, and many graduates have been sent to inland China to conduct on-the-ground investigations of social and economic conditions. The commercial school in Xiamen undoubtedly has the same mission.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese University in Beiping, emerging at this time, is even more noteworthy. In recent years, the number of Chinese students going to the "friendly nation" to study has increased day by day. Among these many students, there must be many who are truly seeking knowledge. However, it cannot be said that there are none with ulterior motives. They have seen through this point and simply established a university in China, partly to "promote" culture and partly to "manufacture" some "Japan experts" to serve them. Achieving two goals with one action, why not do it?</p>
<p>There is even "better" news: the "friendly nation's" cultural work is not only focused on intellectuals, but will also benefit the common people. The other day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting to discuss cultural undertakings towards China, because in the past, they had focused too much on academics and had little contact with the Chinese people, and therefore had not achieved full results. Therefore, it was decided to establish industrial research institutes in Jinan and Tianjin. This is complementary to economic policy. Recently, they have been focusing on economic development in northern China. The establishment of industrial research institutes is to guide farmers and improve industries. This effort is much more beneficial than academics. No wonder a group of "friendly nation" dignitaries often issue high-sounding theories about stabilizing the lives of North China's farmers.</p>
<p>Cultural aggression is so fierce. What methods should we use to resist it?</p>
<p>The Story of an Old Woman, by Xiu Yang</p>
<p>After dinner, this square is a good place for the public to cool off and chat.</p>
<p>In the countryside, dinner is not eaten after sunset. The evening glow hangs in the sky like festive lanterns, and the evening breeze blowing from the top of the old elm tree awakens people from the fatigue of the day's work. Several farmers who like to have a drink temporarily gather some leftover dishes and sit freely in a corner of the square. The scent of rice fields is carried by the evening breeze, and they are already looking forward to this year's harvest.</p>
<p>Some news heard from teahouses in the city is good material for long cool nights. A simple story, a legend from the newspaper ten or fifteen days ago, they talk about it with great interest. Day after day, it gradually transforms into a strange story, and even the person who started telling the story can no longer figure out its origin and end. The years of the villagers are filled with joy before the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>This year, there is an old woman who is good at telling stories in this square. According to her, her hometown is in a province hundreds of miles away, and she has wandered to this town to visit her son. When a person with a foreign accent appears in this town, there is always an inexplicable rumor. When the old woman settled down, someone spread the rumor that a certain party had come to spy, and that she was investigating the town's strengths and weaknesses, and that a certain party would soon come to rob the town. This rumor did make the people in the town very panic. They are not afraid of being robbed, they are all poor, but everyone has a hope pinned on the fields they are working hard to cultivate. Before the harvest, they are unwilling to give up and flee for their lives. If it is just the time to thresh wheat, how can they escape with these hard-earned properties? So, some courageous women made friends with the old woman. The old woman spins yarn at home every day. She is very kind. She is an old woman who has experienced the world, and she often helps young people solve many difficult things. Her ability to tell stories makes the people in the whole town get closer. When the old woman realized that her arrival in the town was being seen as a secret, she began to tell her own story.</p>
<p>——Her hometown is north of the Yangtze River. She married her husband at the age of fifteen, because poor families are unwilling to keep their daughters for long to share the profits. Her husband sells various medicinal materials in the five northern provinces, and it is rare for him to stay at home for a month a year, but their relationship is very good. She gave birth to a son when she was twenty years old. Giving birth to a son in the first pregnancy is a great joy. Her husband did not go out to do business for more than half a year that year because of the birth of his son. At that time, people often came to her house to make trouble with her husband. Those people were her husband's companions.</p>
<p>One day, when the sky was just beginning to dawn, they came and took her husband away. At the time of the Ya Pai, someone came to tell her that her husband had been hacked to death by the pond three miles away. This was a bolt from the blue. She ran over there crying with her child who was a few months old. She also ran to the local official to demand that the murderer be apprehended. This murder case was solved three years later. It turned out that her husband and that group of people were doing a secret business in the five northern provinces. She gave birth to a son and stayed at home for half a year, and his companions thought that he wanted to quit, which was detrimental to them, so they wanted to kill him.</p>
<p>After her husband died, the old woman took her three-year-old child and wandered around. She worked as a beggar, a servant, and a female worker. She did all kinds of lowly work for women, and she raised her son to adulthood.</p>
<p>But when a civil war began, she was working as a sock weaver within the firing line, and her son was arrested. When the war ended, her son did not return. She spent more than ten years searching for his whereabouts in every province and every county in the north, even if she could see her son's bones. During that period, she endured a harder life and all kinds of humiliation.</p>
<p>Now the north is like another world. After suffering for more than fifty years, she is unwilling to see that kind of cruel massacre again, so she came south to this town.</p>
<p>This story aroused the sympathy of the people in the town. They had all grown up in hard times, and they had also suffered the same fate as the old woman. They vaguely felt that their hopes had been dashed, and farming was no longer their lifelong profession... The old woman's story gradually alienated their will.</p>

<p>Words by the Lakeside, by Lü Gang</p>
<p>Recently, I have often liked to take a nap, perhaps because life makes me feel too tired? Every day I run back from a long way, and that's how I waste an afternoon. You say, "Work hard! Laziness deserves a beating." But no matter how I resolve to "work hard," the result is still the same. Sometimes I scold myself very harshly, but sometimes when I think about it calmly, I feel that the surrounding environment really makes it impossible for me to be quiet...</p>
<p>I really want to escape this atmosphere, but in fact there is no way for me to do so. So sometimes I have a leisurely mood and look at the sunset glow in front of the window. These few days, the sky at dusk has been very beautiful, and I occasionally think of the distant view of that dusk I saw in the carriage... This kind of mood may be abnormal, but I feel a bit of a "stealing leisure from busy" sensation... I fight with a contradictory psychology all day long. Therefore, I often think of the "dual personality" you mentioned: "One side is innocent, lively, enthusiastic, happy, gentle... but the other side is absolutely different: melancholy, sentimental, quiet, cold, stubborn..." I feel that a person's life is just a constant struggle between these contradictions. Therefore, no wonder some people attribute a person's innate personality to the environment.</p>
<p>The living environment has been a bit dim lately, and the more we feel distressed, the more the environment feels "unclear." Sometimes I also have a quirk like you, liking to sit alone quietly and remain silent. So you said this in a letter when you were sick: "...I always like to stay alone in the quiet, dim garden, without moving or making a sound. I often want to run to the mountains or the seaside to cry to my heart's content, or just bury myself in the magnificent sea, or break myself to pieces in the abyss..." These words moved me very much and aroused my sympathy. We said that after a certain period we would go to the beach to see the vast sea, but we have not yet finished this matter. We are dragging on day by day in a gloomy environment and in a busy life. ——How can a young person survive in this "prematurely aged" atmosphere?</p>
<p>A person is sometimes very contradictory. A year ago, I lived quietly in a bustling city, and I felt extremely empty. I had no way to pass the long days, and I read an extremely precious book from beginning to end seven or eight times. Now, I am so busy all day long that I don't even have the opportunity to read, and I still feel extremely empty.</p>
<p>Someone talked about Tolstoy's extraordinary temperament and enthusiasm, and I didn't quite agree with this person's words. I remained silent. I thought of the passage of Tolstoy that we had debated repeatedly; I now have a new interpretation, that is a most noble feeling for people... Perhaps you will no longer stubbornly argue with me about this. Of course, this debate is not without meaning. I am often afraid that enthusiasm will damage reason. So I still agree with the opinion you said: emotions should not be released casually, but should be restrained.</p>
<p>The impulse of enthusiasm often kills a useful person. It is a pot of fire, and it will cause disaster when it cannot be contained.</p>
<p>Often, enthusiasm is a great driving force for promoting work, but it is only possible when holding a pure sense of career. However, now, although we have not lost enthusiasm for the cause we are loyal to, and we still have youthful energy and confidence, I feel a bit of unbearable fatigue under this gloomy situation.</p>
<p>I believe you will suspect that I am sick. If it is really a disease, it doesn't matter, because I often forget my body. Just as I forget my individuality in a crowd. But in fact, from my physique, there is no way that there would be no signs of disease. I feel that as long as this tired mood can take a breath in the bright sky, it will be enough.</p>

<p>Xiao Hou, it hasn't been long since I saw the dead cicada lying in the dragon fruit in front of the window, and I suddenly remembered the little cat and rabbit buried in your garden. ——These poor little animals, after all, quietly passed away in people's manipulation...</p>
<p>I looked at the sky, the sun had already set, but the beautiful sunset glow had not yet appeared.</p>

<h3>"China Travel" Will Perform for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Recently rehearsing, producing scenery, busy state of busyness. From September 3rd, the "China Traveling Troupe" led by Mr. Tang Huaiqiu will continue to perform at the Carlton. After performing at the Carlton, they went to Beijing to perform at the "World" and "Capital" theaters, and returned to Shanghai with praise last month. After a short rest, they immediately began rehearsing. Mr. Tang also telegraphed Dr. Chen Mian, the director of the troupe in Beiping, to come to Shanghai. Mr. Chen specially wrote a new play "Motherland" for the troupe, which tells the tragic history of the demise of the European "Flanders" country in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Mr. Chen will personally direct it, and more than 30 actors will participate, including the troupe's new members Tian Zizhao, Pan Bingxin, Du Guang, Jin Qian, Zheng Ling, Bai Dun, female members Lingzi, Meng Fen, Yan Ke, Bai Yan, etc., as well as the original members who stayed with the troupe. Rehearsals have now been completed. Set designer Wu Jingping and others have created sets in the medieval style, including several scenes such as castles and streets, all of which are rare and great sets on the stage. The sonorous lines and gorgeous costumes are even more impressive. In addition, Mr. Yang Hansheng, a playwright of the "China Stage Association," wrote the play "The Eve" based on the recent situation in North China. The structure is exceptionally wonderful. Mr. Tang Huaiqiu went to Beijing to obtain the performance rights of the play, and is now rehearsing day and night. Because of the realistic plot of the play, it will surely move people's emotions when the time comes.</p>
<p>As for the play "Thunderstorm," it has long had a large number of continuations in literature. The audience praised the last performance, and it was still full until the last show. After the performance was stopped, the audience sent letters and telegrams requesting a continuation of the performance, but it was not possible because the theater was rented to Westerners to show British films. Therefore, it was decided to perform it again at the Carlton to live up to the audience's support.</p>

<h3>President Wang Discusses the Significance of Establishing the Jiangxi Zhongzheng Medical College: National Shortage of Medical Talents, Especially Easy to Establish a College in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) President Wang told a reporter from the Central News Agency on the morning of the 28th, about the significance of preparing to establish the National Zhongzheng Medical College in Nanchang. There are three points: (1) The Ministry of Education recognizes that there is a shortage of medical talents in China, and there are still few medical schools and colleges in the country, and the talents cultivated are limited, which is far from meeting the current needs. Therefore, in recent years, the Ministry of Education has been striving to improve the quality and quantity of medical education. In addition to sending personnel to inspect the original colleges and ordering them to improve, the establishment of dental colleges and the preparation for the establishment of pharmaceutical colleges are all determined according to actual needs. The intention of establishing this college is also based on this. (2) The establishment of a medical college must have sufficient equipment and a complete hospital for students to practice. Now the new hospital built by the National Economic Council in Nanchang has been completed, so the preparation of this college is easier. (3) Jiangxi Province has been making rapid progress in local construction in recent years, and there is an urgent need for public health administrators. The Jiangxi Provincial Government can also raise funds to assist in the preparation of the college, so the college council has made this decision. As for the Ministry of Education sending personnel to Jiangxi to prepare a department, the Ministry of Education is considering candidates.</p>
<p>Another telegram said that President Wang went to the Ministry on the morning of the 28th to deal with Ministry affairs. Lei Zhen and Huang Longxian, secretary of the Ministry of Education, arrived in Beijing by boat from Xun on the afternoon of the 28th.</p>
<h3>Overview of Compulsory Education in Guangdong Province: More Than 600,000 Yuan Raised This Year</h3>
<p>Guangdong Province has been able to pay attention to compulsory education. Therefore, in 1928, the Provincial Compulsory Education Committee was established to assist in the implementation of compulsory education. The number of schools and students has increased year by year. In 1931, there were 18,969 elementary schools in the province with 1,098,965 students. After the promulgation of the first three-year education administration plan, it progressed even more rapidly. By 1934, there were a total of 12,754 elementary schools with 1,469,406 students. Compared with 1931, the number of schools increased by 3,785 and the number of students increased by 370,441. In 1935, the overall situation was planned, and measures were formulated. Impoverished counties were given subsidies, while wealthy counties were required to manage themselves. A total of 70 counties in the province received subsidies: 20 counties received subsidies to open two ordinary elementary schools and four short-term elementary schools, 20 counties received subsidies to open nine short-term elementary schools, and 30 counties received subsidies to open five short-term elementary schools. The 20 relatively wealthy counties did not need subsidies and were ordered to raise funds on their own. The three newly established counties in Qiongdong and the jurisdiction of the Nanshan Administration also received special subsidies. The source of the subsidies was partly from the provincial treasury and partly from central government subsidies. The province subsidized the opening of 40 ordinary elementary schools and 160 short-term elementary schools, while the central government subsidized the opening of 250 short-term elementary schools. The Provincial Compulsory Education Committee has repeatedly decided on the implementation of compulsory education in the province in 1936, and the original subsidy measures will be maintained and improved. This year, the central government has ordered a subsidy of 220,000 yuan for the province's compulsory education, and the province has raised funds for compulsory education itself, following the central government's regulations, and has raised more than 100,000 yuan. Therefore, it is not difficult to achieve the original plan for the promotion of compulsory education in the province this year.</p>
<h3>Aquatic Institutions Telegraphically Request to Maintain the Tianjin Aquatic School</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Tianjin Aquatic School has achieved remarkable results since its establishment and has a long history. Now the Hebei Provincial Government has decided to abolish it due to budgetary reasons. Aquatic institutions and schools across the country were shocked by the news and telegraphed to plead for its maintenance. The excerpts are as follows: (1) Song Junjian, Chairman of the Beiping Jicha Political Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, was shocked to learn that Hebei Province has decided to abolish the Provincial Aquatic College due to budgetary reasons. This school is the highest aquatic institution in the country, with a long history, complete equipment, and outstanding achievements. Once abolished, not only will students have nowhere to go, but aquatic professionals across the country will also lose their leadership. We hereby telegraphically request to maintain the status quo in order to value aquatic education.

<h3>Reorganization Movement of the Shanghai Westerners' Football Club is in Full Swing: Mr. Davidson Plans to Fundamentally Reorganize the Westerners' Club, Whether the Junior Teams Support It is the Key to Success or Failure</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Westerners' Football Club controls the authority of the Shanghai Sino-Western football scene. Its content and organization have never changed in the past 20 years. Whether it is the Shanghai A and B League, Cup matches, International Cup matches, or inter-port matches, they are all controlled by the club, which holds all the power. This is so-called monopolistic management. However, according to recent observations by football experts who have returned from England, this management and organizational content is outdated and does not conform to the trend. It should be immediately reorganized according to the British method to become a modern football club. The first person to propose this reorganization was a Scottish expert named Davidson. At last year's annual meeting of the Shanghai Westerners' Football Club, Davidson once proposed his reorganization plan, but the result was that Davidson failed. The Shanghai Westerners' Football Club still has the same organization and management. This year's annual meeting of the Westerners' Club is scheduled to be convened soon. After his failure last year, Davidson is preparing to make a second comeback this year. Such a big issue, which affects the entire Shanghai Sino-Western football scene, whether it will be established and passed in the future is worthy of attention from the sports community.</p>
<p>Davidson's Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>The most important content of Davidson's reorganization of the Shanghai Westerners' Football Club is to change the current monopolistic management system to a dual management system, that is, to separate the A and B Leagues from the Westerners' Football Club and make them independent, but under the supervision and command of the Westerners' Club. The football teams of the A League gather together to manage and hold the A League matches themselves. The B League is managed and held by the B League teams themselves. As for the Silver Cup, international matches, and inter-port matches, they will be handled by the Westerners' Club. In this way, the greatest benefit is to put the League and the Silver Cup in an equally important position. In the current state, it is common to see the Westerners' Club rush to finish the Silver Cup every year, and then hastily end the League. Under the club's own management, there will be no such situation. The second point is that players have an opportunity to appeal. In the current situation, players who are punished have nowhere to appeal. In the new system, players who are punished in the League can appeal to the Westerners' Football Club, the higher authority. These are the key points of Davidson's reorganization content.</p>
<p>The Key to Success or Failure Lies in the Junior Teams</p>
<p>Although this plan is a fatal blow to the current Shanghai Westerners' Football Club, because after the League becomes independent, the economic aspect will be severely hit. The biggest ticket revenue is in the League matches. Most of the senior teams agree with this plan because ticket revenue does not cause economic problems. However, junior teams have no hope of ticket revenue, so the key to the success or failure of this plan lies entirely in these junior teams. The failure of Davidson's plan last year was because the junior teams were wooed by the Westerners' Club and expressed their opposition. The success or failure this year still depends on their junior teams. However, it is heard that the Westerners' Club is also making arrangements. (Zhen)</p>
