<h3>從山海關到瀋陽</h3>
<p>— 企光</p>
<p>靜裏往事追懷。有若一塲驚心動魄的惡夢！</p>
<p>世態是這樣險惡——離奇的惡夢，也會臨到平凡的我們身上；眞難怪那些不平凡的人們，都拚命要改造這個險惡的世界了！</p>
<p>幾經事變，故鄉已沒有可留戀的了。於是我們决定遠行！遠行的意義：不是要避危就安，更非自甘沈淪，只是環境厭煩了我，我又厭煩了環境，暫時改變一下；自己還要竭力鍜鍊，企盼着在光明的未來，能盡我應盡的責任！</p>
<p>我們的經濟能力有限，買的是「硬三等」車票，（按由西伯利亞赴歐洲的直達快車，三等分軟硬兩種，票價相差的一倍）要穿過被侵略的故土，開始我們探險般困苦的行程！</p>
<p>平瀋直達特別快車是早晨過山海關，同車的華人很少，有兩三個是隨着牛津團到日本去參觀的團員。該團團員大多數是英國人，美國人，也有一兩個日本人。此外，還有一個矮胖的中國人，能說一口漂亮的日本話，說是到長春看朋友，春實或是趕到僞國新京去做偽官！剩下就是我們和另外兩個到歐洲去求舉的靑年了。</p>
<p>車到山海關的時候，充偽國稅吏，警察的日人都蜂擁上車，一切西洋人都被他們睛到餐車去簽偽國入境護照。全節車裏只剩下幾個中國人，任他們擺佈。警察，憲兵如狼似虎地接二連三査問護照，以及每個中國人的底細。稅吏似乎是故意麻煩，呌把所有的箱籠完全開好，他本入却到別的地方，去麻煩別的中國人！秩序因之紊亂起來，旅客們心中都忐忑不寗，日本稅吏，憲兵來往穿梭，遇有不如意的事卽惡言責罵。我們等了一回不見稅吏來査行李，又不敢關住箱籠，於是跑去找稅吏。稅吏不通華語，彼此以英語問答，冷不防觸怒了旁立的兩位憲兵老爺，他們强拖我返回我原來的地方，厲聲厲色要處置我；可是，當他們看到我的妻站在我身邊的時候，他們有些顧慮了。於是，他們問我：</p>
<p>「這是你的甚麼人？」</p>
<p>「我的妻。」</p>
<p>「你到底是中國人？西洋人？西洋人到餐車去！」他們懷疑起來！</p>
<p>「當然是中國人！」我似乎有點驕傲起來。</p>
<p>「她呢？」</p>
<p>「她是我的妻，當然也是中國人！」於是我們把中國護照及她的國籍證明書給他們看。</p>
<p>他們看了以後，彼此又討論了一下，才沒說話就走開了！</p>
<p>車開行了，車廂裏走進來一個日本婦人及一位僞國的老太婆和她的三十多歲的兒子。稅吏仍不見轉來，我們的箱籠仍是開着橫在地上，不敢關閉！大概是妨碍了那位日本婦人吧，她打手勢呌我們把箱籠關上。我們照着她的話辦，以爲稅吏不會再來的了！箱籠剛關好，放回了原來的位置，穿白衣的稅吏却又凶狠狠地站在我面前，要我再開一切的箱籠。我向他解釋，他全不理睬；只好忍氣吞聲再把箱籠都開好。那時腹中已很飢餓了，兩臂也甚疲乏，心裏又氣，偶一不當心，一隻沈重的皮箱摔到我身上，再掉下地去，我的左肩受微傷，皮箱的一角也摔破了，稅吏大笑不止，以爲他已盡欺凌的能事了！我瞪圓了眼睛看了看他，讓他檢査，他査看了一遍，把各箱籠翻得亂七八糟，也沒找到甚麼違禁的東西！</p>
<p>行李獄査過後，妻摸着我的左肩安慰，連聲呌我「忍耐」，並勸我到餐車去吃點東西。</p>
<p>在餐車裏，雖然呌了早餐，一點也不能嚥下喉！兩眼圓睜睜地不住向窗隙間馳過的小山，豐茂的樹林及靑葱的田園送目；再看看車中來往穿梭及身旁餐桌坐着的浪入，不覺有一陣亡國慘痛湧上心頭！</p>
<p>「咳！這……」我似憤恨又似傷戚地要說話，妻又急按我的手，呌我「忍耐」！</p>
<p>從餐車走回來，看見那兩位到歐洲去留學的北平靑年，臉色非常頹喪，悶悶不樂，我却不敢前去·詢問究竟，因爲車內的浪人太多了，處處受着嚴重的監視！</p>
<p>那位到僞國去做僞官的矮胖老爺，用日語和日憲兵談了一陣，當然一切都無問題，他却很神氣地憑窗瞭望他的新主宰的統治十！</p>
<p>參觀團裏有一位團員，和我很面熟，大概是舊日的同學，他很關切地來問我。我怎敢說甚麼，只好答覆他「一切都解决了」我們站在過廊靠窗叙舊。那位朋友驀地提起：</p>
<p>「這裏的風景還不錯，今年的收成必定會好的」！</p>
<p>『咳！大好河山……！」我的話沒有　完，也不敢說完，我們四目相視，都相對默默無言。我們再談了些別的閒話，就各歸各的座位了！</p>
<p>車廂裏那位日本婦人是新聞記者，那位僞國黃瘦不堪的靑年也是錦州某報主筆。和他們稍稍周旋，按不住心頭的怨氣，又懶得和他們胡扯，只好以假寐解圍</p>
<p>沿途旅客以日人最多，僞國人甚寥寥。大概旅行是極困難的，勿論僞國人，日本人在査票的時候都要拿出類似護照的東西給査票員看。日本在僞國的統治，周密到這地步，能不令人戰慄！但，同時也表現了統治者的虛心和恐懼，又焉知不是遍地義勇軍掙扎戰的影饗呢？</p>
<p>車沒有到瀋陽以前，我們曾想在瀋陽不停留，儘可能地從速離去僞國；在另一方面，我們又想「觀光」瀋陽，看看侵略者統治的究竟！</p>
<p>咳！成千上萬的關外健兒正冒着砲火，散在各地與敵人作最後的掙扎戰，我們闊少」般的旅客，到那里去看看，只須「學金人」的緘口，有甚麼可恐懼呢？所以我們最後的决定；勿論如何，在瀋陽停　一日！</p>
<p>我們未出國前，曾聽最近到過瀋陽的外國朋友談，在瀋陽最好住某德國小旅舍。恰巧車抵瀋陽的時候，該旅舍接客人又立在我們的車窗前，所以毫不費周折地投入了該旅舍。在車站上有一大隊的日軍正舉行悼亡禮：車站附近佈滿了日韓浪人；日本商店，銀行……連接着車站，佔了一大塊地區！身臨其境與旅行日本無異，只是日軍成羣結隊地奔忙，浪人的橫蠻，在日本內地想也少見的！</p>
<p>德國小旅舍居偏僻街巷的一角，設備尙稱精緻，遠離鬧市，不受「檢査」滋擾，甚爲舒適！</p>
<p>我們在傍晚時分，到街頭散步，市面上異常蕭條，一所龐大的植物園——萬宜園內陰暗得怕人，街上來往的僞國入民都帶着鴉片烟鬼的臉面，走過窄巷，更有兩面傳來的鴉片烟氣，薰人欲暈！在車站附近，街上站滿了日本妓女，盡其勾引的能事！於是，我忽然回憶起五年前由海道赴歐洲，經過西貢時的所見！統治殖民地的策略，大概都是這麼一套把戲吧！</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>華洋義賬會十五週年紀念</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>華洋義賑會到今日已有十五年的歷史了。該會是國際統一救災總會的後身。成立於民國十年十一月十六日。歷年以來。在我國各省的救災工作上。所成就的卓著的業績。是我國民深所感謝而不能遺忘的。民國十年以後。我國的災荒連年不絕。就較大的來說。最初有華北五省的旱災。繼則有蘇浙皖的水災。川黔滇的旱災。和豫陝甘的水旱災。到民國二十年。空前的大水災。幾乎佈遍了整個的中國。二十一年。又有古黑鄂冀晋的水災。贛陝的旱災和風災。二十二年則形形色色的災荒。又佈遍了整個的中國。冀魯皖蘇浙鄂湘陝綏黔等省有水災。湘鄂甘陝豫皖閩黔等省有風災。陝晋冀豫皖贛黔等省有雹災。陝蘇浙黔等省有風災。冀蘇浙等省有蟲災。二十三年則水災遍佈於湘鄂豫冀晋陝川閩皖贛等省。旱災佈遍於魯豫湘鄂贛蘇浙皖冀陝晋等省。二十四年春荒之後又。來了一决瀰漫全國的大水災。災區雖不及民國二十年的廣泛。但災情的慘酷。却不亞於民國二十年。今年雖然全國號稱豐收。但四川等省。郤還是遭着旱災。</p>
<p>每一次災荒到來。災民動以萬計。財產損失。動以十百萬計。各慈善團體莫不盡力救濟。以期减輕災民的痛苦。可是大多數祗能救災於事後。而不能防災於事前。他們除施賑以外。至多不過在水災發生時。從事於防護搶堵罷了。只有華洋義賑會郤能具遠大的眼光。在施賑以外。還建設水利工程。以防止水旱等災。倡辦農村合作。以復興農村經濟。該會不但做了許多慈善性質的救濟事業。而且做了不少建設性質的社會事業。</p>
<p>後一種事業是最値得我們來稱道的。我們知道我國之所以多災。不外乎兩種原因。其一。列强的經濟勢力深入了內地。農村日益陷於破產的狀態。農民的衣食尙且不足。當然更沒有餘力來改良耕種的技術。其二。過去的中國當局對於水利建設。也太過忽視。華洋義賑會本其賑災所得的經騐。深知中國災荒的這兩種根原。不從根原上來着手。災荒是不勝其救濟的。因此該會的名稱雖是義賑。而其事業。却不以此為限。該會在賑饑以外。還用以工代賑的辦法。鑿渠築堤。以防北水旱災的釀成。建築公路。以便農產物的呑吐。創辦農村合作社。以蘇解農民的經濟困苦。這些事業是艱難而且繁重的。幸賴該會熱心的中外人士的慘淡經營。才有今日這樣卓著的成績。我們可以說。該會在我國復與農村經濟的工作上。建了一個良好的基礎了。現在乘該會舉行十五週紀念之日。我們除把該會過去的成績。表揚一番以外。更希望該會繼續努力。為我國人民造腦於無窮。</p>
<h3>日政友會　外交方針　主中日「滿」提携</h3>
<p>（東京）十五日在富山市召開之政友會北信大會、鈴木總裁（代誦）力主打破官僚萬能之惡風、及擁護議會政治鼓勵黨員、繼則通過宣言决議、該宣言中關於外交方針者如下、</p>
<p>依照現下之國際情勢、不得不以確立外交方針、為國策之中心、卽庶政一新宜以此為先决、而構成其形體、夫日本之外交、在藉與締盟諸國輯睦、以期世界之和平、尢以担任東亞全局之興廢、使十億之入民得安居文化之樂土為大宗、因此宜注目中日「滿」之親善提携、然而邇來中日關係之欠調整、實至堪痛恨、政府應連以日本公正之方針、個別解决富件、而謀中日外交之根未調整、是所不可遲疑者也、（十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>德片面廢止通航條欵　引起各國反響　柏林此舉純屬政治示威　事前先徵得意奧匈同意　各關係國準備集體抗議</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間今日得悉、德元首希特勒於宣布廢止德國河道自由通航條欵之前、當先得意奧匃三國之同意云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）德國廢止國際通航制度之照會送達法外部時、外長台爾博斯正在其選區貝立格城、因此特由外交决長魏耶諾與白倫總理面商應付辦法、外交部嗣於晚間訓令駐紮各關係國之法國大使、命其與各駐在國政府商討德國此舉所造成之局勢、外交部現信各該國不久當向德國政府提出集體抗議云、此外關係方面人士則以為德國此舉、純屬一種政治示威之性質、蓋德國政府在外交上、倘採取經常途徑、卽不能使國內入民獲得滿意、故必須出以驚人之舉、在過去如此、今亦猶然、抑德國此舉、業已使歐洲大多數國家受其影響、而以英國對於萊茵河及基爾運河通航制度、所受影響為特甚、按一九二〇年波蘭與蘇聯發生戰爭時、有英國運輸艦「維爾勃爾登」號裝載軍火、謀經由德國基爾運河運往波蘭、當時德國政府禁止該艦通過該運河、然凡爾賽條約則曾明白規定、各國戰艦商船得自由通行基爾運河、以故英法意日四國特為此事、聯合向海牙常設國際法庭提起訴訟、結果德國卒吿敗訴云、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）德政府本日照會十四國政府、宣佈廢北凡爾賽條約所載德國河道國際自由通航之條欵、此項照會係於本日午後四時方行送達法國外交部、因此法國政府對於此舉、採取何種態度、目前尙無從知悉、惟一般人預料法國定當在短時間內、决定其立塲、按照凡爾賽條約、萊茵河亦准由各國船隻自由通航、而設立萊茵河通航中央委員會以管理之、該委員會甫於數日前在法國斯脫拉斯堡城舉行會議、尙未畢事、但至今晨德國代表突然宣佈奉召返國、中止出席、同時駐柏林法國大使館亦接得德政府口頭通知、謂德國政府現退出各項國際河道委員會、並宣佈將本年五月四日在法德兩國所訂萊茵河通航暫行辦法、亦加以廢止、此項暫行辦法、規定變更萊茵河通航之原有制度、係於數月前經德國政府之要求、由法德兩國直接談判而簽訂者、原定自明年一月一日起方加以實施、在簽訂該項暫行辦法時、德國政府表示十分滿意、今乃亦宣吿廢止，此種舉動出爾反爾、允為此間政界人士所不解、抑德國宣佈廢比國際通航制度之舉、牽涉德國境內所有各河道、使多數國家受共影響、卽上决大戰時、守中立之若干國家亦在其內、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>法考慮應付對策</h3>
<p>（巴黎）外交部頃發表公報稱、關於萊茵河國際通航事宜、前經德國政府發起、曾由法德兩國舉行談判簽訂恊定、（按卽係指本年五月四日簽訂之萊茵河通航暫行辦法而言）藉以建立一種新制度、代替凡爾賽條約所規定之通航制度、此項協定、現正由萊茵河通航中央委員會在斯脫拉斯堡城開會討論加以充實、不久卽可商定辦法、而德國政府竟於此際片面的宣佈廢止凡爾賽條約所載國際通航之條欵、且除萊茵河以外、如厄爾伯河之通航辦法、本已成立與萊茵河同樣之恊定、至於沃特爾河通航辦法、亦正在進行談判中、乃德國政府均未顧及、關於此事、法國政府現正與其他各關係國進行協商、同時並已訓令出席斯脫拉斯堡會議之法國代表團聲明廢止本年五月四日法德兩國所簽訂之萊茵河通航暫行辦法、此項暫行辦法原定於明年一月一日起實施、現當作為無效云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國頗不以爲然</h3>
<p>（倫敦）德元首希特勒氏昨日宣布廢棄凡爾賽和約內關於各河流國際化之數條欵後、英人視之、頗不為然、若輩堅稱、德國應仿土耳其對於海峽問題之態度、藉談判而獲得修正、法國外交部謂德國之行動、將有影響及於萊茵與曼亨兩條約、曼亨條約成立不過數月、今有與有關各國重新談判之必要云、德國通告與其最近行動有關各國之照會、其中聲明凡與德國和好之各國、其船隻仍可駛於德國河道、有關各國如許德國船隻駛於彼等國內之河道、則德國對於彼等船隻駛於德國河道、亦並不歧視云、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）凡爾賽和的所載歐美各國船舶得在德國某某河道自由通航各項條欵昨日業由德國政府宣吿廢北、此間一般人因得訊太遲、未及加以評論、至消息靈通人士則謂意國對於歐洲各項問題所採態度、乃以各國一律享有平等權利為鵠的、其對於德國政府上項舉動、自必善意處之云、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>中歐商業影響巨</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）德政府片面宣佈廢止國際通航制度之一舉、國際方面認為與綏和歐洲局勢之企圖、殊屬背道而馳、並謂各國中受德國此項决定之影響者、當以捷克為最甚、蓋捷克國境、週圍均係陸地、共唯一出海之道路、惟厥厄爾伯河與多瑙河之國際航道、及德國境內漢堡與斯丹丁兩自由港口而已、現德國旣將境內河道國際自由通航制度、宣吿廢止、財捷克將遭閉塞、而無出海之路矣、國際方面人士、又以為德國此項决定、在中歐各國均小免受其影響、則以多瑙河自德國烏爾姆城起、卽作為國際河道、其間通過奧國捷克匈牙利·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·以入黑海、故關係中歐各國航運及商業、實甚爲重要也、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>捷政界大爲驚訝</h3>
<p>捷克京城　德國駐捷克公使埃森陀爾、本日向外要克勞夫達正式通知德國政府决定廢止凡爾賽條約所載關於國際河道之條欵、此間關係方面聞訊、頗為驚訝、蓋關於捷克在德國內河通航之一事、前經德國方面要求、開始談判、歷時頗久、中間曾由捷克向德國作極大之讓步、今德國竟乃片面的宣佈廢止國際通航之條欵、致使此項談判歸於破裂、殊出一般人意料之外也、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>運河計劃成泡影</h3>
<p>比京　凡爾賽和的所載歐美各國船舶、得在德國某某河道自由通航各項條欵、昨經德政府片面宣吿廢止之後、此間政界人士以為、比國所置船舶行駛萊茵河中者、的一千艘之譜、其總噸位的有八十萬噸、以故此一問題對於比國、自屬直接有關、且比國久擬開鑿運河、溝通慕斯河（在比國境內）與萊茵河（在德國境內）、按之凡爾賽和約、卽載有一項條欵、規定此項運河在德國境內一段工事、當由德國擔任之、今者此一條欵亦已一併宣吿廢止、因而此段運河、自無興築之望矣、各該人士並謂、本年五月四日、法德兩國所簽訂之萊茵河通航暫行辦法、荷蘭政府未允加入、德國今茲所為、卽以荷蘭政府態度為口實、足見德國對於法比兩國利益、實未顧盧及之云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>匈牙利感覺不安</h3>
<p>匃京　凡爾賽和的所載歐美各國船舶、得在德國某某河道自由通航各項條欵、昨經德國政府片面宣吿廢止之後、此間一般人頗為不安、政界人士雖云德國此舉、早在意料之中、但匈國出口貨物、係以多瑙河為孔道、德國對於該處航務、若果實施新制度、則匈國對外貿易、勢將為多瑙河下游諸國（卽羅馬尼亞、南斯拉夫等國）所控制、而此等國家、又均非匈國之友邦、此則匈國所引以為懼者也云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國不擬提抗議</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）德國宣佈廢止凡爾賽條約所載國際河道自由通航之條欵一舉、實係違反美德兩國所簽訂之和的、蓋美國雖未簽字於凡爾賽條約、然美國與德國所簽訂之歐戰媾和條約第二條、載明保障美國得享有凡爾賽條約所載關於河道部份之一切優惠、因此德國廢止凡爾賽條約內該項條欵、自不免使美國受其影響、然半官界人士、則以為美國政府不至向柏林提出抗議、蓋美國所行一般外交政策、對於各種破壞條約之舉動、僅主張由官方發表宣言、對於破壞條約之整個事實、加以譴責、而不主張就每一事件提出抗議、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅馬尼亞　外交政策　尊重條約　擁護國聯</h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　國會頃於本日復會、國王加洛爾、躬親蒞臨、當卽宣讀詔書、略謂、羅國所行外交政策、乃係在國聯會機構之內、與各國敦睦邦交、通力合作、與各同盟國、加緊其相互關係、俾得維持國際和平、並保障本國領土之完整、「一切舉動、其目的凡在增强國聯會之威望與權力者、本國政府决當竭力支持之、現行同盟條約更當發揚而光大之、並當與各同盟國當局常川保持密切接觸、」繼就內政問題所有說明、略謂政府决當加緊充實軍備、以固國防、最後乃籲請全國人民務當團結一致、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美海軍航空處建議　改善沿岸設備　太平洋中心設航空根據地　供商業活動日無反對理由</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）海軍航空處今日發表週年報吿、建議擴展並改進沿岸設備及海軍航空根據地、以便容納美國之海軍飛機、因根據海軍方面之計劃、至一九四〇年將有飛機一九一〇架云、同時報吿中亦建議立刻建造二百五十萬立方呎之飛機一艘、及一百五萬立方呎之金屬船壳飛艇一艘、（十四日國民寗）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日據陸軍官員宣稱、陸軍工程師建議以美金一百萬元在威克島築一航空根據地、按原議築於半稈威島、因威克島距爪姆東一四五哩、而米特威則在更東一二四八哩也、消息靈通各界並謂不日或將提出改善爪姆狀况之建議、據代理陸長糜爾通吿報界、此項計劃與華盛頓海軍公約太平洋中防禦工程事無關、乃欲為飛行太平洋中之飛機備一降落地、以便利商業之活動、因今後飛機往來於太平洋者或將日見其了故也、此項發展、志在為商業飛艇備一安全之根據地、其規模甚小、不足供軍用云、衆院外交委員會主席麥克萊諾爾斯氏亦與麼爾氏同意、謂此舉性質一種表明、亞洲國家無一可加反對云、按華克島目前為汎美航空公司橫渡太平洋剪風飛艇五停留處之一、其地追近日本代管之太平洋中加羅林等羣島、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間觀察者稱、美國如在威克島及半程島設置海面飛機根據地、實為日本在太平洋代管各島建築海港工程互爭勝負、猶憶歐美各國皆曾屢决表示、謂日本對於代管各島之商務、並需虛糜鉅貲、以建築此項海港工程、蓋海軍專家咸稱、遠東如有戰爭、此種海港可為最佳之潛艇根據地云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本新造　航空母艦　定期行命名禮</h3>
<p>（東京）據海軍省發表、日本海軍之一大威力、昭和九年十一月二十九日在吳海軍工廠興工建造之水面機母艦「千歲」號、定於本月二十九日在該工廠、由伏見軍令部長代表降臨、舉行盛大之命名典禮、又該艦闊十八公尺八、吃水五公尺七八、排水重九千噸、馬力一萬五千匹、速率二十海里、亦備有高射砲四架等優秀之性能、（十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日本民航　革新行政機構</h3>
<p>（東京）為期民間航空之劃期的躍進、航空行政機構之改革事、遞信省提倡航空外局案、陸軍當局亦提航空省案等、是否採納目下在四省會議審議檢討中、遞信省因設置外局、作為明年度預算、已向大藏省要求、此次大體已承認如下、</p>
<p>（一）因革新航空行政、增加經費四十六萬九千金、（一）航空局廳舍新築費二十五萬八千金、（一）航空綫業務調查費六萬九千金、故日本民間航空行政、期自明年度將見劃期的飛躍也、（十五日同盟電）</p>

<p>在這多事的國際情形之下、祇改善國聯組織或盟的原則之實施、雖屬緊要的與必需的、但却不能作爲維持國際和平以及促進國際間的諒解最有效的方法、我以前曾說過最近的情勢固爲少數國家的侵略、以及各國軍備的競爭而愈趨嚴重、各國之間、互相猜忌、而對於法律及正義觀念的信仰、亦漸趨消失、卽愛好和平的國家、在逼迫之下、亦不得不重整軍備、於是武力又重行抬頭、無論大小國家、均受重大的犧牲、結果增重了人民納稅的負擔、其日常生活必需條件、亦因此减低、以應付軍備的苛徵、此種事項、必須有以制止、否則事態的爆發是不能避免的、因此我請問諸位减軍問題是吾可以重行提出、而减軍會議是否可以重開、而從最低的條件下、再行復活呢、與减軍問題應同時注意的、乃經濟復興的問顯、或許可以說重整軍備、是達到經濟復興的唯一方法、就一般而論、整軍的目的、大部分是在取得市塲及新的原料供給、以資充實經濟、道種經濟的國家主義、佈滿在目前的國際間、不惟阻止商業、且障碍經濟復興、進一步講更能以引起國際間的不安、尤其是富强的與貧弱的國家之間、此種經濟壓迫、始終是國內不安、以及國際爭執中心、我因此又要請問諸位是否能設法使各國接近袒直的友好的態度、討論此種經濟問題、並合作以探討解决的方法、我很相信我所請問的幾個題目、都是重要萬分的問題、卽我自己也不能輕於置答、至少我可以說對於消戢戰爭以及集體安全爲目的的和平運動、我國始終願盡其一份合作力量、我國目前情形、固然很困難、而其力量固然很薄弱、但是其景仰和平之心、都很熱烈、而對於促進和平一點上、允顯以至誠促其實現云、</p>
<h3>（五）我國獲選行政院理事及海牙法官記</h3>
<p>關於行政院改組委員會之報告書、在第一委員會審查之經過已如上述、國聯大會於十月八日午後六點鐘舉行第十五决全體會議、選舉海牙法官及行政院新設之兩席主席、宣佈開會後、卽請資格審查委員會立卽開會、審查各國代表送呈之法官薦舉書、及法官之履歷等項、以便開始選舉海牙法庭三位法官、惟爲節省時間計、於該委員會審查完竣之前、同時進行行政院理事選舉主席、因宣佈曰根據中國於十月二日照會請求候選行政院理事大會、應依照一九二六年九月十五日所通過决議案第二條第一二兩節之規定、第一步先舉行複選資格投票、（記者按依上述兩節之規定行政院非常任理事於其任期期滿後非經過三年不能恢復被選權、如果未滿三年期限而希望當選者、必須獲得全體票數三分之二始能取得複選資格、我國席位於一九三四年滿期、未及三年故須經過該項手續）並邀請法國代表彭戈與蘇聯代表李維諾夫爲檢票員、並用秘密投票方式開始投票、結果如下、</p>
<p>票數共五十二張、廢票兩張、有效票數共五十張、三分之二之多數爲三十四張、我國得贊成票數四十八張、反對票數共兩張、主席因宜布我國獲得複選資格、據一般人之猜想、投反對票者、大的爲土耳其與比利時、土耳其因與我方競選海牙法官、故藉此以洩忿耳、比利時之不投我票、其態度已表現於第一委員會中、允可證明者、於選舉之前、堂我代表團宴會各國代表時、各國或由首席代表親自參加、或由决席代表替代、獨土耳其代表團謝絕邀請、其理由可具見矣、我國旣已獲得複選資格、大會遂依照上述一九二六年决議之規定、進行選舉兩理事席、選舉方式仍爲秘密投票、主席並邀請坡利維亞紐絲蘭兩國代表爲檢票員、開票結果、票數共五十二、有效票數五十二、絕對應得票數二十七、我國獲得五十一、萊多維亞（Lalvia）獲得四十九、兩國一時均當選爲三年任期之非常任理事、自當選之時起、得立卽就席於行政院、大會中全體一致鼓掌、表示慶賀之意、情形頗爲熱烈、我國因能立時就席於行政院、故對於法官選舉時、在行政院中亦立時增加一票、同時並有臨時活動之機會、故我兩項當選、實有連帶的關係、回憶兩年前我國落選時、國內某學者對於郭伊之成敗頗有譏諷、乃不意郭使兩年以來之努力、有志竟成、或者郭使當日爲公使地位、故不免失敗、而今則已升任大使、故能成功歟、記者不禁有所感矣、理事選舉完竣後、資格審查委員之工作、亦已完成、海牙法官之選舉、遂亦開始按法官選舉手續、大會與行政院同時投票、若候選人在雙方之票均佔多數、始爲當選、如有不同結果、則大會與行政院、均須另行投票選舉、仍爲秘密投票方式、日本與巴西於大會開會之前、曾要求參加法官選舉、故大會准許日本巴西兩國臨時參加大會及行政院投票、因業經第一委員會審查同意、當該案在第一委員會審查時、我代表亦極贊同、蓋因去歲日本海牙法官長岡氏之選舉時、聞對我曾有交換條件之諾言、我代表爲希冀多得一票、但其結果似乎適得其反、實際如何吾人固難判定也、第一次法官選舉、係爲補選德籍許慶·美籍凱洛格兩缺、大會投票結果、美國曼勒。胡德生得五十四票中的四十八票、瑞士之韓麥斯鳩爾（Ake　Hammarskold）得三十八票、兩人所得均過半數、並爲得票最多者、同時據行政院報告、投票結果兩人所得、亦過半數、於是兩人均已當選、第二决選舉王寵惠博士的缺時、大會投票結果、票數共五十三、有效數亦五十三、合法半數爲二十七、我鄭天錫博士得三十一、已過半數、土耳其之愛德金（Ertekin）氏僅得十八票、未足法定半數、但同時行政院投票結果、則以愛德金氏之票數爲多、於是大會不得不宣佈雙方重選、當時我方出席行政院者、爲郭代表、得郭之臨時聯絡及英國代表之帮忙、結果頗爲著效、蓋失敗成功全在最後幾分鐘的光陰、一票之得失、足以左右之、故行政院重選結果、十六票中（加日本巴西）我得八票、土耳其得七票、中有一票空白、故我方得過半數、此一廢票眞可謂左右成敗之中心矣、據開我方之八票、爲英國·巴西·紐絲蘭·智利·萊多維亞西班牙·玻利維亞·及我國、有謂設廢票者爲蘇聯、亦有爲法國者、蓋蘇聯與法國初曾對我表示、其票早巳許與土耳其、其後當我方同其疏通時、其語氣頗爲含糊、或投報廢票、表示居間、或因大會第一次投票之結果、而表示讓步未可知也、大會重選結果、票數共五十一、廢票一、有效票數五十、合法多數二十六、我得三十、土得十七、雙方結果、我鄭天錫博士當選任王寵惠博士之缺、選舉事後各國代表及我新聞記者紛粉向我國代當時土耳其訪員於法官選舉君一飲、否則反之、於時相對執筆、靜候消息、乃當結果發表時、記者的同事業已不見踪影、可謂有趣矣、（行政院得主席按拉丁字母輪流次序、明年一月之會議、卽九十五屆行政院我國將任主席、）</p>
<h3>（六）結論</h3>
<p>第十七屆大會已於本月十一日閉會了、自况已略如上述、但閉目廻思覺有不少感想、頗願爲讀者道之、記者感覺此次我之兩重獲選、雖係外交上之努力、收得的效果、但其主要關係、尤在國家本身、溯自二十餘年以來、在外交塲合上、外人對我無論好意的或惡意的友愛的或仇視的、莫不以我無統一政府爲勸告，或爲攻擊、自九一八事變以來、東北旣以失守、西甫尚存割據、一九三四年、我國理事落選、足啟吾人之最達的反省、雖然理事與法官的獲選與否、不足以左右國家之盛衰、但其成敗實與我國國際地位之升降成正比例、乃自數月以來、兩廣問題之和平解决、對外則樹立了中央集據政府統一之事實、對內則足以領導全國民衆趨向一致目標、允以數年來各種建設亦表現突飛猛進、外人對我之態度與觀念、亦因之大爲改善、此項事實實爲促進我國際地位之最大原因、故在外交上種種問題、亦較前容易進行、惟其如此吾人更當鼓勵向上之心、蓋吾人最大難關日益迫切、阿比希尼亞之殷鑑、時在吾人之前、允以此次大會對於阿比希尼亞之態度、更可爲吾人將來之警告也、此外對於我國代表團允覺有不能已於言者、謹陳一二、以作蒭蕘、誠然本年我代表團無論在工作上、在本身行政上、俱有相當的表現、由工作上言之、大會中之各委員會、我各代表除其對外聯絡時間外、無不親自出席、故對於各種問題應付、亦甚切實得體、堪使吾人滿意、而加欽佩、就其本身行政言之、較前猶有改革、蓋職員人數較去歲旣已减少、職員旅費津貼亦較去年减半、首席與次席兩位代表、俱身兼兩個委員會之工作、總核其成績、不可謂無長足的進步矣、然而吾人亦不可因此便爲滿足、允望千百尺竿頭冉進一步、以便明年大會時較今年更爲澈底、回想去年大會時、我代表團人數的有二十六個之多、考其有實際工作者、或不及三分之二、唯其無相當事可作、故不免荒費光陰於私人娛樂中、試想遠道而來、旣勞往返、徒耗費用、於國家果有何裨益、事成已往、吾人固亦無斤斤追求之必要、且幸今年情况已有不同、然而以人數而論、仍不免有供過於求之概、且仍有不遠千里而來、風花雪月、歡暢無拘者、竟若忘其國家所處何境、本身所處何地、由所得與所失相比較、誠不可同日語矣、在此國難危急財窘民疲之秋、惟有各個人脚踏實地負起責任救亡圖存、庶幾有望焉、抑者允望職員諸君對外則加緊聯絡、對內則减少互相應酬、往者不諫、來者可追、區區管見、敬獻於我代表團、未識以爲然否、光陰永逝、轉瞬大會已完、各代表團業已風流雲散、勒曼湖邊、落葉蕭蕭、威爾遜大馬路之車水馬龍氣象、只有待諸來年了、（完）</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>勞逸爾初試身手　東華凈勝四球　敵軍勇而無謀實力平平　東華之勝利全賴合作得法</h3>
<p>敵軍勇而無謀實力平平、東擊之勝全賴合作得法東華足球隊昨以極嚴之防禦、極快捷之脚頭、擊敗新近來滬之勞逸爾軍隊、凈獲四球、戴麟經之兩次射門、美麗非凡·可稱本季之傑作、勞逸爾向駐新加坡、初次來滬羅其足球藝術、更遇勁旅東華、似應有相當之呌座力、但昨日市體育塲兩對面司令台、猶僅及　半、台之左右兩旁、亦僅散坐三四百人而已，合計祗千餘之　、海上足球比賽號召力之衰落、可以上週申園法商東華之獻機祝壽賽作有力之證據、遑論市中心區之路遠迢迢、更須經過一段「虎門關」也、</p>
<p>勞逸爾有勇而無謀勞逸爾之寶力、祗可稱「中庸」兩字、勇敢有餘、藝術則不足、對於球之管束力及防禦進攻策略、俱少相當造詣、前鋒不能呼應互援、故不能近門發射、更無法破對手之防禦線、徒用遠射、此乃窮極無法之舉，圖使張榮才大顯身手、救出不少妙球、後方奔出甚遠、彼此聲氣不通、看守不嚴、遂使手前鋒個個均能盡務發揮、守門之技、所負四球、雖則無法挽敘、但觀其平素救球工作、頗露慌張脆弱之態、右翼脚頭甚好、但被顧尚動嚴密監視、亦無所用其極、中堅亦一壯士、東華門前數次罰球、俱由此公主踢、極美麗動人、全隊藝術、遠不又蘭開夏、</p>
<p>東華陣容聯絡緊凑東華連容十分緊凑、攻守俱佳、始終不懈、良以生客當前、不知其虛實也、戴麟經表演最為出色、第二第三球之射入、美麗無比、非戴莫辦、吳炳浩之代萬象華職、稍見軟弱、前後衛均甚出色、張榮才救出不少遠球、博得彩聲不少、上半時東華僅由許文奎打中一球、下半時戴麟經於開始之五分鐘內、連中兩球、往後許文奎又中一球、而以四比零結束、</p>
<p>五分鐘內即獲一球東華開球先攻、卽被勞逸爾截住竄入、左冀踢角球出界、吳炳浩首先向敵門發射、被守門愛利斯接住、賈幼良得戴麟經之傳遞、送至門前、時勞逸爾兩衛離門太遠、往返不及、許文奎竄至前方、一踢中鵠、距開賽僅五分鐘、勞逸爾之實力、曰使觀者得一概要、雖屢圖侵略、射門無術、不能深入禁地、戴麟經得一極佳機會、勞逸爾防衛不嚴、使東華前鋒、頗呈活動之態、</p>
<p>敵軍逞强勞而無功十八分鐘時、東華門前右斜角二十五碼處、被罰任意球、敵隊右內鋒夏泊爾主踢、中鋒茂弗得球圖射、李寗救州重圍、掙扎未久、莊友仁又犯規被罰、踢成野球、東華再度進攻、許賈互犯越位、麟經得吳炳浩之傳遞、乘對方空虛、舉足扣門、但脚頭未準、球出無力、掠門出界、此後東華曾幾度告急、陳鎮和單騎救主、厥功甚偉敵軍繼續壓迫、屢有美麗之遠傳、脚頭極清晰悅目、祇以東華壁壘森嚴、使敵騎不得深入腹地、</p>
<p>麟經連中美麗悅目角逐之間、東　忽又被罰、地點在門前四十碼處、勞逸爾賴愛。得直接向門猛射、球勢平急、煞是美觀、惜差以毫原、越門而出不久上半時終了、休息再戰、敵軍中鋒茂弗與左翼克雷登、對調職位、局勢仍無顯着發展、戴中鋒得吳炳浩之接濟、射中門角、是球才進、縱使愛利斯有三頭六臂、亦决無挽救可能、勞逸兩開球、一鼓而下、東華門前又被罰任意球、賴愛德脚頭强硬、球着地如矢穿向門去、張榮才仆地托出、文奎引球進攻阻於耐勒、賈幼良上前接應傳送門去、麟經乘球尚下落地、以快捷之脚、側鈞入門、美麗悅目、不可再見、東華遂以三比零遙佔勝勢、離下半時開始祇五分鐘耳、</p>
<p>文奎活躍又立一功敵軍力謀掙扎、懷愛丁一次打門極佳、可惜未中、東華攻勢殊盛、十五分鐘時許文奎又立一功，東華門前忽又被罰、賴愛德踢來殊急榮才蹲下抱住、敵軍再進中原、但祇能益旋於罰球綫外、無懈可擊、戴麟經出沒敵陣、與老孫等呼應有方、敵軍忙於招架、一次戴引球穿過敵人、直趨門前、輕輕向門一撥、不料人意失事、滾出門邊、此後戴許又各射一次、均中門往彈回、可惜之至、但已使愛利斯驚惶無措矣、鳴令收軍、東華以四比零奏凱、裁判員海爾、</p>

<h3>章淵若播音演講　「擁護領袖」與自力救國（四）</h3>
<p>四，國民自力的覺悟</p>
<p>基上所述、我們便可觀認到一個實與民族的基本原則來、這便是我這幾年來所提倡的「自力主義」關於「自力中義」的註釋、我已只草專著（註十二）且曾公開講演（註十三）、茲姑從略、我們究研天下的事理、雖是變化萬殊、但終有其一定不易的因果關係、本末之道、我們不能捨本逐末，也不能倒果因為果因、以言國力、則國力的原素、其表現於羣體者、固為大眾的向心力、其蘊畜於個體的者、則又為每一個人民的自動力、而煎者為果為末、後者則為因、為本、故欲圖一國國力的强盛、首當求每一國民智力，德力、體力之充分而健全的發展、易言之、即是求全國民衆自力之增饗、</p>
<p>用歷史的眼光來衡斷，一個民族的復興與發展、無論其立國的方針如何、主義如何、其　初而不能　等的階段、莫不為舉國上下自力的準備、遠如勾踐之生聚教訓，歐洲之文藝復興、日本的明治維新、固為自我覺悟與自力更生的先例、近若土耳其、德意志的中興、蘇俄與意大利的發展、又何嘗不是其舉國上下、埋頭苦幹人盡其力的結果、基於這種歷史的信念、所以、</p>
<p>自力主義、是一切救國理論的中心基準、</p>
<p>自力主義、是一切救國運動的基本動力、</p>
<p>無論信仰如何、目標如何、登高自卑、行遠自邇、在一定的歷史演進的關係上、莫不應以自我努力為起點、為基綫、人必自已先有能力活動、然後纔可參加共同努力、（註十四）</p>
<p>中國以往一切轟轟烈烈的運動、所以祗有一時的興奮、而未有待久的力量、祇有表面的虛張、而未有切實的成效、中國以往一切志士仁人的努力、－切主義學說的宣傳、所蔣公五十壽辰後一週演講、以都不能推動中國，救國中國、其失敗的癥結、可說都是因為缺乏了自我的覺悟、與自我的努力、</p>
<p>德國的希特勒、羣知其為一個獨裁的首領、然而他却昭告其黨人與國民說、</p>
<p>「吾人苟自問建設與維待國家之力　何在乎、曰、惟犧牲個人私利、為社會謀利之能力與决心而已、（註十五）</p>
<p>「設」民族懶惰懦怯，平庸無能則常因此覆亡、（註十六）</p>
<p>「人類一切價值、悉寓於人格之中、每一理想、每一事功、分個人創造之結果、（註十七）</p>
<p>崩潰沒落之日耳曼民族、到處受人唾棄、國民須由信自力、以產生自覺力、始足圖存、」（註十八）</p>
<p>以德國足族性之優越、其首領尚深慮其民衆的懶惰懦怯、平庸無能、而必大聲疾呼以激發其國民的自信力與自覺力、益微「刻苦自强」實是興國圖强的根本大道、中外領袖、其所期望於國民的、固人同此心、心同此理也、</p>
<p>所以、我們誠有愛於領袖、消極的、不應任領袖作孤軍的奮鬥、積極的、尤當有自我努力的覺悟、國力固應該集中、但是首先應當自我努力、然後才有所貢獻、若僅徒託空言、試問有何「力」可集、而口頭上的擁擭愛戴、亦將有何實益、領袖縱然堅苦卓絕、孤軍奮鬥、但是倘使長眾無力追隨、仍是不能解其後顧之憂、</p>
<p>我們怎樣纔能救起國家呢、要充實國力、</p>
<p>我捫怎樣纔能算愛護領袖呢、要集中國力、</p>
<p>然而國力如何纔得集中呢、端賴國民自覺、</p>
<p>國力又如何纔能充實呢、先要自我努力、</p>
<p>全國的民衆啊、大家要共凜覆亡的慘禍、確認民族復興的契機，捐棄私利、力戒虛浮、各從本位、完成任務、用自力來充實國力、用自力來復興民族、</p>

<h3>我們應該往那裏走呢？</h3>
<p>— 何似</p>
<p>讀「國難的故事」後</p>
<p>中國國勢到了今日，可說巳經頻於危亡的地步！國際帝國主義對對於這個死氣沉沉的老大國家，巳在明目張膽地以對待殖民地的手段相對付；國內許多喪心病狂的生就的奴才，正在以半殖民地自許。雖有少數淸醒份子，在那裏火聲疾呼；無奈一般民衆依然沉睡於目前的苟安，沉睡於認識的不足。帝國全義者的砲聲縱然巳在身邊咆哮，而保全身家生命的迷夢，猶是依戀在朦隴的睡眼裏。當此華北的警報頻頻傳來，猶有人但冀其不越黃河而南下，以遂其偷安且夕的夢想者，不但一般不識不知的民衆如此，卽少有身家之貪戀者，也莫不如此。所以喚醒大衆，使明瞭國恥之所由來，國恥的曆疊演進，巳至於何種程度，帝國主義者貪婪無厭的饑殘的形態巳進展至若何程度，非使全國大衆有一個明白正確的認識不可。卽我國近百年來所受於帝國主義者的巧取豪奪，蠶食鯨呑的情形，非使全國大衆瞭然於心目不可。</p>
<p>然歷史的演進，絕不是一朝一夕之故。我國國勢的危岌，直到今日的地步，當然不是一朝一夕造成的事實。現在一般被稱為覺醒的民衆，固然巳知道國家恥辱的繁重；可是能够瞭然於國恥的前因後果，瞭然於國恥的層疊發生的事實者，龍有幾人？這種認識不足，印象糢糊的恥辱感，自然只够發生些凑凑熱鬧的虛勁，不能澈動全體民衆，感得切膚的深痛，起來作救亡圖存，復興民族的有血性的轟轟烈烈的運動。所以能够把我國所受於帝國主義者的壓迫的事實，探源尋本，詳細說明其經過，指示其現狀，使一般大衆有一個系統的認識，知道所謂國恥者是從怎樣來的，經過了怎樣慘痛的過程，巳到了怎樣危急的狀態，才能使人認識明確的環境，選擇他們應取的途徑，發動全民族所有的力量，義無返顧地，為求民族解放而起來與帝國主義者周旋。總理遺囑詔吿我們說：「在喚起民衆」。所謂喚起民衆者，卽在使民衆認識國家的處境，明白國家的恥辱，起來作民族解放的鬥爭而巳！</p>
<p>古人說：「知恥近乎勇」。我全國民衆非無大勇，甘心為世界各帝國全義者的俎上肉而任人宰割。所以不能發勳全民族的力量，以與世界帝國主義周旋者，因不曾深感國家與民族所受之恥辱；數千年來專制政治的結果，把全民族的命運寄託在統治者的手裏。造成這些國恥的，是負着統治責任的滿淸帝國和民國軍閥。我們身上巳重重鎖上奴隸的鐐銬，打上奴隸的烙印，從不知起來為這萬刧不復的奴隸身份而鬬爭；我們是被人家賣了而還不曾明白自己命運的可憐人。這是我們的奇恥大辱，我們全民族的奇恥大辱！我們要起來打破這些鐐銬，洗去這些恥辱，我們要先明白這些憯妄的統治者所出給人家的賣身契約是什麽，把它來一氣撕毀，重新建起獨立自由的民族國家來。</p>
<p>最近開明書店出版的「國難的故事」，把我國自務片戰爭以來的近百年間的國家恥辱，窮源究本，說明其因果，系統地叙述其層層累積的事實，用淺顯明白的文字，寫成一本國難史，給我們這班被賣的奴隸，一個明白自身命運的機會。我讀了這書，受到極大的感動，因此很想提出來，介紹給生活在被視為殖民地上的我中華民族的全體大衆、作者在「給讀者的信」的那篇代序上說：</p>
<p>「我常常想要明白這一會事：我們的國家，為什麽現在到了這個地步呢？滅亡的危險，巳經臨到了我們的眼睛前面。我們的弟兄，有的巳經做了別人的奴才，有的快要套上奴才的鎖鍊。……我為了找尋這些東西，費了好久的功夫，讀了幾尺厚的書本；我想現在每一位中國人，都有像我一樣的疑問，都要明白這一會事，可是未必每個人有功夫像我一樣的做。我要把我所知道的東西，講出來，讓大家知道。……讀者看過我的書之後，如果能够明白近百年來，我們中國受列强壓迫的情形，那末我的目的就達到了。」</p>
<p>這書，我想，每一個中國人，每一個還有中華民族祖先的血液在他身體內流動着的人都應該一讀，尤其是全民族未來生命所寄託的中學生諸君都該應一讀。這是現在我們救亡運動中的寶典，是喚起民族魂的警號！讀了這本書，我們的熱血自然會沸騰起來，我們的復興民族的勇氣自然會發揮起來。我們現在已經沒有路，除出我們起來，掐脫我們的鎖鍊，打倒我們的敵人，為解放我們的民族而奮鬬！</p>
<p>這本小書，共分二十講，現在把每講的內客約略寫出在下面：</p>
<p>第一講「一個比喻」作者把近百年來這老大國家的不爭氣的情形用一家混亂的人家來作比，因而招致外人的覬覦，始而在門外窺探，繼而打破大門，盡情地掠奪，把全書的故事作一個烏瞰。</p>
<p>第二講「他們怎樣轟開大門來」是講歐洲各國怎樣急於找尋殖民地，和怎樣看中了這個老大帝國的中國，怎樣地開始在廣州通起商來。結果，怎樣釀成鴉片戰爭，使這老大帝國的面王，第一次抹上恥辱的印記。他寫鴉片戰爭的結果說：「英國人原來的意思，只要能達到通商的目的就罷了。現在中國朝廷手忙脚亂的情形，中國官吏的　預和將士的不中用，都被他看在眼裏了。他明白這樣一個大國，簡直像一隻肥猪。雖然有許多人，這許多人却是不愛他們的國家，他們連飯都沒有吃呢。」把當時政府的腐敗，人民的疾苦，都寫得明明白白了。</p>
<p>第三講「外國兵第一次打到京城」這裏是講英法聯軍攻進北京城，焚燬圓明園的事。作者把這次京城失守的原因，寫着以下的話「中國的官兵武器雖然沒用，可是外國軍隊打到國都，却也不像心裏想的那樣容易。可惜聯軍打天津北京的時侯，只有北方的幾支中國兵抵敵，大部份的中國軍隊，正在南方打太平天國，忙着在殺自己飢餓的弟兄，對於外國軍隊攻打北方，來不及救援，所以英法聯軍就很容易地北進了。」</p>
<p>第四講「上海是這樣繁榮起來的」這一講是記着正當太平軍與淸軍火併，國勢動盪，戰雲彌漫的時候，英美法等國的商人乘機佔據上海，自成特別區域，好像是獨立的小王國一般。漸漸地侵佔司法，把持海關，一切事情都由外國人管理。外國軍隊還幫了淸廷打太平天國。結果：「太平天國在長江下游的勢力，被外國軍隊所打倒，所受的影響很大。同時外國軍隊殘殺中國飢餓的老百姓，流了不少鮮血；這些鮮血，灌溉了正在萌芽出來的上海，使牠一天熱鬧一天。」</p>
<p>第五講「路過牆來的俄羅斯」這一講是記中俄的歷次交涉，喪失了東三省以北比東三省面積還要大的土地的故事。</p>
<p>第六講「琉球做了贄見禮」這是講東鄰第一次紅起眼來，用欺騙恐嚇的手段，拿了琉球去做了第一次的見面禮。</p>
<p>第七講「打了勝仗送了地方」這是記中法為安南街突，劉水福與然軍戰於諒山，中國戰勝，而李鴻章怕事情鬧大，反在天津訂了以安南歸法保護的條約。</p>
<p>第八講「西南的籬笆拆完了」這她講西南藩屬暹邏緬甸的失去的故事。</p>
<p>第九講「怎樣失掉朝鮮」作者寫：『這次中國陸軍在朝鮮遼東的大敗，實在由於領兵的將軍，飯桶的居多，有一個呌衛汝貴的，他做了幾十年的將軍，刮了幾十萬的家財，年紀巳大，絕對不顧到自己的責任。他帶兵到朝鮮去，他的老婆寫信給他說：「你年紀老了，錢也有了，應該好好地享老福，何苦去拚命呢。」於是衛汝貴抱了這個主張，一見日本兵就逃。』這是多麽令人髮指的事！</p>
<p>第十講「檄倖地沒有被瓜分」這裏講的是日俄在東三省明爭暗鬬，拿中國的土地利權作為他們搶奪的目標，引起英法德等國家爪分中國的野心。結果，我們整個的國家，任他們自由劃定勢力範圍。要不是美國為自己的利益出來作門戶開放的主張，幾已被他們實行了爪分。</p>
<p>第十一講「可憐的反抗運動」這是講的義和團排外運動的愚蠢可笑的故事。而八國聯軍入北京，也為國恥中被蹂躪最甚，受損失最重的故事。</p>
<p>第十二講「自己的地方別人的戰塲」這是講日俄因為爭奪中國的東三省權利，分贓不勻而起的日俄戰爭。拿我們的地方給他們做戰塲。</p>
<p>第十三講「用錢買奴才」這一講是說列强帝國中義以投資開工廠，築鐵路的種種手段，把我們當作奴才收買了去。</p>
<p>第十四講「誰說還像秋海棠葉呢」這裏說，中國的地形本來活像一張秋海棠葉子。「大家早巳商量好：美國對於西藏，俄國對於蒙古，日本對於東三省。……中國再不打出活路來，新疆綏遠察哈爾，怕也不會讓中國所有吧？」誰說還像秋海槃葉呢？</p>
<p>第十五講「獨占形勢的開塲」這裏說，歐戰以後，列强自顧不暇，中國又不能奮發自强，因此造成了日本的獨占形勢；而中國做了而獨占下的唯一犧牲，供它肆無忌憚地啖食。</p>
<p>第十六講「重新在均勢局面下掙扎」這是講大戰後，列强仍注視到東亞來，美國倡導的太平洋會議給日本的獨占形勢以相當的限制。同時中國的「五四運動」，也給了獨占形勢相當的打擊。於是這個不爭氣的國家又得在新均勢的局面下掙扎。</p>
<p>第十七講「我們只有滾蛋的份兒嗎」道裏所講的是我們飢餓的弟兄，飄洋過海，到國外去尋一口苦飯吃，怎樣被虐殺或趕掉的故事。</p>
<p>第十八講「英勇的抗爭」這一講是叙述上海的三卅慘案，廣州的沙基慘案，漢口無條件地收回英租界的抗爭，及五三濟南慘案等，中國的民衆漸慚地抬起頭來，不怕流着熱血去和帝國主義者抗爭了。</p>
<p>第十九講「宰割的第一刀」這裏講的是九一八東三省的斷關，一二八上海的抗戰，及猴子戲一般的偽滿洲國成立的經過。</p>
<p>第十講「瓜分？獨吞？還是復興？」「中國今後的運命將怎樣？被日本獨吞雲呢？被列强瓜分呢？還是不情願像不爭氣的印度，埃及，美索不達米亞一樣，要復興起來建設一個平等而合理的計會呢？」「瓜分？獨吞？復興？—我們中國已經走到這樣的三又路口了，我們究竟應該向那裏走呢！」這是本書作者最後的呼聲！</p>
<h3>如何讀書作文？</h3>
<p>— 文亮</p>
<p>最要緊的必須懂得方法問題</p>
<p>無論做行麽事情，最要緊的是方法問題，有了方法，不僅做起來輕鬆愉快，而且需時不多，成績特優。比方，一個出門去旅行的人，他有了一本旅行指南，他照了旅行指南上所指示的方法去旅行，他就不會多耗光陰，多花錢財，多傷精力，充分可以得到放行上的樂處了。讀書和作文也是這樣的，懂得了讀書和作文的方法，就事半功倍；不懂方法，彷如走進了牛角尖，無法可以走出來。所以讀書和作文，我們必須要懂得如何去讀如何去作才好。</p>
<p>現在有許多哥兒小姐們，他們聽對了「讀書」兩字就要感到頭痛；在學校裏的學生，聽到「作文，」也就十分討厭，所以上課的時候，每多睡覺，談話，看小說，而作文呢，碰到懶惰一些的敎師，於是知己知彼，一學期中可以不作一次。這樣的求學，徒然耗費父兄血汗得來的金錢及自己實貴的光陰，完全是欺人欺己，倒不如還是不讀書，把這些光陰，金錢，精力來做些別樣的工作，比較值得一些。這種學生的自暴自棄，不是讀書應有的態度。但同時，做敎師的人，他祗是敎死書而不將方法敎給學生，他也難辭其咎的。雖然有的敎師很注意於方法問題，但是敎學生讀死書的那也不少。</p>
<p>我們在學校裏讀書作文，敎師專心在方法問題上指導我們的，這當然很好；否則，我們自己要買幾本方法問題的書來看看才好；這等於我們去旅行，沒有人為我們響導，我們自己也必須要找一本旅行指南來翻翻是一樣的。關於讀書和作文的方法問題的書，十幾年前，書店中不大容易找到；就是找得到，也是僅有的十分簡略的幾本而已。現在，這類的書籍很多了。比方，懂以開明書店一家而言，就有了：</p>
<p>學生學習法……定價二角</p>
<p>我們怎樣讀書……定價九角</p>
<p>中學各科學習法……定價七角</p>
<p>讀書的藝術……定價四角</p>
<p>學習與鍜鍊……定價四角</p>
<p>寫作的健康與疾病……定價四角</p>
<p>文章作法……定價四角</p>
<p>文法與作文……定價五角</p>
<p>小品文作法……定價六角五分</p>
<p>文心……定價七角</p>
<p>上述諸書，如果學者讀過了一遍，他就會懂得了讀書和作文的方法，以後見到書不會感到頭痛，讀起來倍加興味。至於作文，卽使說不會作得怎樣的好，至少也不會被人說一句不通了。現在，我再將上述諸書的大槪來說一說吧！</p>
<p>「學生學習法，」這是一本小小的小冊子，是一位外國的大學敎授，本其多年自己硏究學問的心得，提綱絜領，寫成是書。康谷君因為這種著作是有助於學生的修學問題的，所以很信達的譯成了我們的國語。因為此書她薄薄的一本，我們讀起來是很不費力。「怎樣讀書」，這是一本集取國內學者論述讀書方法的文章而成的。這是我們國內有名學者將他硏究學問的心得很忠誠的叙述出來的一本書，我們依照了他們的指導去學習，可以花少數的精力和時間，得到不少的知識學問。「中學各科學習法，」這是由許多名家各自叙述他硏究的學問的一種方法。現在有許多人往往對於某種功課沒有趣味，這就是對於某種功課不懂學習方法的緣故。這一本書，各科均皆說到，所以可以說是每一個學生必須具備的一本好書。「讀書的藝術」「學習和鍛鍊，」這是兩册中學生雜誌叢刋裏的書。別種談學習法的書，每請大學教授或是專門學者來寫述，然而他們往往不大明白中等學生的心理及其程度，所以自己花了大力寫成　著作，中等學生往往不大感到適用。這兩本書都是以中學生為對象的，所以中學生閱讀到更為親切而有味。「寫作的健康和疾病」，這也是中學生雜誌叢刋中的，內中文章，是指導中學生作文如何可以得到健康，如何可以增加不少。「文章作法」，此書早巳風行全國，大家都認為現在講作文法的書中最好的一本。他詳細叙述各種文章的體裁，寫述的方法，命題的要點，我們不僅可作敎科書用，就是自修，也甚合用。「文法與作文」著作者在一個中學校裏花了十多年心血，本其實騐所得，寫成是書，比之人家的著作，當然更有價値了。「小品文作法」是作者在學校中敎作文法時的講義。曾經有好幾個學校採為敎本，大家都感到很合實用的。因為現在普通學校裏的作文，大槪都是小品文，所以這一冊書是値得大家注意的。「文心」一書，用小說的體裁，寫述寫誌的故事，我們閱讀，不僅像是在讀小說，而且在看小說之中可以得到不少讀書和作文的方法的，所以這一本書大受社會歡迎，每個中學生的案頭，應該置有一本的。</p>
<p>我是一個敎國文的人，因為最近學生間我關於讀書和作文的問題，所以對學生說了上面的話。又因這些話，有許多人也很需要，所以不揣簡陋的寄緞帶讀書俱樂部。</p>
<h3>對於中學生雜誌的話</h3>
<p>— 顧驥</p>
<p>我是一個中學生雜誌的新定戶，但是它在我腦中所感受到的影響，還在好幾年以前。</p>
<p>大槪在我剛出校門的時候吧，偶然不知在那裏讀到了這書，直歡嘉得不忍釋手。然而因為書是別人的，所以未能讀個暢快。後來又因經濟關係，連升學都不能，終於沒有把它定閱。</p>
<p>直到去年，才算財運亨通地搶到了一只出賣勞力的破飯碗，五毛六，作為一天的血汗的代價。除了商陋的衣食費外，每月居然也可以多這未幾塊錢。一向覺得工餘時間，在寂寞中荒發過去，非常可惜，要想出一個辦法，來求點知識，也曾化了極賤的價錢，去買些一折九扣的小說，然而毫無益處，偶然看見了中學生雜誌的廣吿，才回憶得幾年前的慾望，便刻不待緩地，决定去豫定。</p>
<p>向來自怨自艾的我，自從得了這書後，好像突然從黑暗中爬到了光明之地，幹什麽事都提高了不少的興趣。每每剛從郵局裏把牠取了來。捧着讀的時侯，便自言自語地發出了「唔…」。含有「一切都明白了」的意思的聲音來。可見牠對於我的魔力之大了。</p>
<p>書中我所最感興趣的，是那髓筆。小說靑年文藝。和靑年論壇這四種，而屬於靑年們的文藝和論壇，對於我的信仰心尤大，在每期去檢查牠的篇幅的時候，發見了牠在漸漸地擴大，我總覺得非常歡喜。道裏面的作者，大槪是大學和中學的學生。他們在學裏裏，對於寫作的技巧，當然是經過了一翻鍜鍊的，所發表的作品，又都是經過編者的渲染，所以毫沒有枯燥的滋味，這是使我最喜歡閱讀的理由。</p>
<p>看了人家的優美的作品，使毫無技巧的我，也起了躍躍欲試的雄心。曾經放大了膽子把所感覺到的幻想和事實，綜合一下，寫成小說，隨筆一類的東西。可是寫完後重新再拿起來一讀，總覺不大妥當，久而久之，雖然是苦思力案，非但沒有整齊些的東西寫出來，徒然地倒把字紙簍墊滿了。後來才覺悟，若要自己做得好文章，非得先把別人的作品，細細地去賞鑑，咀嚼一下不可，嚼爛了，再使牠溶解到自己的心裏去，灌溉我的情感。這樣或許還有些功効。</p>
<p>本來我看書，只知道「囫圇吞」，至於牠的結構等等，是不聞而不間的，所以對於書的趣味，自然不會十分濃厚。自從被中學生雜誌喚醒了之後，才理解到看書，并不是一件極容易的事。</p>
<p>我現在極願意永遠地，做牠最忠實的一名門徒，希望牠不斷地以種種甜美的甘露，來灌溉我的心田，啟發我的理智，給予我一種良好底成就。</p>
<p>一方面，又要過慮到這年頭，這用血汗換來的老朋友，他否能够延長下去，五毛六，是否不斷地，照樣的不折不扣的五毛六，不免又要把愁雲之慕，障上了糢糊的心。</p>

<h3>紗銷轉機中求紗業之復興</h3>
<p>— 汪慶麟</p>
<p>我國之棉紡織業，一方受自身資力之限制，一方復受外商紗廠，在國內之努力侵襲，遂至支持困難，　論充分進展。尤以近年來之農村襄落，以及共匪為患，益使紗銷日狹，故該業之危機，與日俱增，去年有不少紗廠被賣或宣吿　理，然至本年上半年間，紗業之嚴重情形，并未轉好，最重要者，莫如天津之裕元華新寳成等廠，為日商鐘淵紡緽會社及裕大等收買，此實為我國民族工業之極大損失，再以近年之紗業統計而論，在二十四年底，全國華商九十三廠，共有紗錠二，七七六，九九八枚，綫錠二五，三五四枚，布機二四，八六一臺，在添置中之紗錠七二，二三六枚，綫錠一九，一〇四枚，布機六三八臺，較之前年，紗錠似增三六，二二三枚，綫錠一二，五二二枚，布機二，二九四臺，以此種設備之數字觀之，似屬差可告慰。惟究之實際，則前年停工者僅十二廠，而去年完全停工者竟遠二十四廠，減工者達十四廠之多。去年上半年，全國開工錠數計四，八〇九，五五九錠，停工錠數為一，三四四，九八六枚，其停工百分率佔總錠百分之二八，自七月至十二月開工錠數為四，九五二，八二六枚，停工才一，三六〇，二七三枚，佔總錠百分之二七，四，但本年上半年開工錠數，雖有五，〇一〇，〇三九枚，而停工錠數竟有一，五五五，〇一四枚，佔開工錠數百分之三十一，是本年上半年紗業之處境，固有增未減也。</p>
<p>返顧全國五十家外商紗廠，共有紗錠二，二四五，三九九枚，已達華商紗廠百分之作一，（其中美商五廠二六一，一四八錠，占外商總錠數百分之十一，日商四十五廠，一，九八四，二五一枚，占百分之八十。）外商綫錠一四九，〇六六枚，達華商綫錠百分之二二五，較多一又四分之一倍。布機二七，一四八臺，達華商百分之一〇九。而本年天津七廠，日商已占其五，共計紗錠一八七，九二車枚，當津市紗業總錠數百分之八一，二。綫錠七，一二四枚，當綫錠數百分之七三，七。在上海方面，復有兩廠被收買之說。最近又致力於北華一帶紗廠之擴充，測其用意，無非欲囊括華北一還之紗業，而後再舉全力以掃蕩全國華商之紡織業，而成獨霸之局。瞻前思後，則衰落，中之華商紗廠，將有不勝前途荊棘之感　！</p>
<p>然本年自七月以來，數年紗銷呆滯之局面，忽轉活耀。且紗價之高漲不已，亦創十年間僅見之現象，此不但紗業本身復興可期，亦國民經濟昭蘇之兆也。蓋其最大原因，實由國內匪亂漸靖，及本年春夏兩熟，農村經濟賴以寬裕，購買力因之漸次恢復，衣被所需，久不購備，尤感缺乏，於是內地布銷先起，故夏季以後，布疋營業殊旺，紗銷繼之，迄今不衰，尤以十月為最，竟有一日間成交達萬包之鉅者。茲列兩年來紗銷數字以資比較：</p>
<p>月份　二十四年（單位包）　二十五年（單位包）</p>
<p>一月　一七、二六九　一九、一一二</p>
<p>二月　一九、〇一一　二四、一八九</p>
<p>三月　一一、三一二　三、四〇三</p>
<p>四月　二六、八二三　一九、三〇〇</p>
<p>五月　一五、〇〇四　二二、七三八</p>
<p>六月　二六、八六三　一五、一五四</p>
<p>七月　二九、〇六四　一九、七六五</p>
<p>八月　二一、二、六　四五、〇五六</p>
<p>九月　三一、一九四　四七、九八〇</p>
<p>十月　二八、九一九　三五、六二一（一日至廿日）</p>
<p>就上表所示，除一二兩月因受去年歲末實行新貨幣政策所刺激，較前年同期稍見增加外，餘月均較去年同期減低。迨八月後實銷楊旺，遂日見遞增。計八月較去年同期增加百分之一〇二·九，九月增加百分之五十二，十月份兩旬數字，已較去年同月增加八、七〇二包之鉅，現紗消費旣大見增加。而生產方面則以上半年之去路呆滯，以及花貴紗賤之結果，不但津滇滬等地久停之紗廠無由復業，即開工者亦相率趨於減工之途，故供給數量因之大減，基於供求不均之理，紗廠因供給愈少，則價格因之愈漲，茲復舉滬地各月存紗數字以證明走銷之旺，以及價格高漲之由來，（單位包）</p>
<p>月份　紗廠存紗　交易所存紗　共計</p>
<p>一月　十八、八六四　二四、二八一　一〇三、一四五</p>
<p>二月　六八、〇四一　二八、〇六一　九六、一〇八</p>
<p>三月　六〇、六七〇　二一、八四五　八八、五一五</p>
<p>四月　六九、五八二　三一、一一五　一〇〇、六九七</p>
<p>五月　七八、三八三　二二、七五五　一一一、一三八</p>
<p>六月　八二、四六〇　三一、六〇五　一一四、〇六五</p>
<p>七月　七二、一八三　三六、五三五　一〇八、七一八</p>
<p>八月　五八、一六七　三三、三四五　九一、五一二</p>
<p>九月　未詳　二二、一二〇</p>
<p>十月　未詳　五、四八五</p>
<p>（註）上表係就紡織時報按期發表數字編成，未發表者暫缺</p>
<p>據布表所示，最近兩月雖未能知其總數，然單就交易所倉庫存紗一項觀之，已可知其梗槪，尤以十月份減少最鉅，竟由二萬餘包，突降而為五千餘包，足見紗銷之旺。於是紗價亦因銳漲不已，可於下表證之。（標準金雞以最高最低平均）</p>
<p>月份　二十四年（單位元）　二十五年（單位元）　增（百分）</p>
<p>七月　一六五·九五　二七·五〇　二五</p>
<p>八月　一七二·七〇　二〇七·五二　一二</p>
<p>九月　一七〇·八五　二一五·〇五　一五</p>
<p>十月　一七六·一五　二三二·〇〇　三七</p>
<p>就上表所列，兩年間四個月紗價相較，所增加百分率平均百分之二十以上。然現紗之漲風，更在標準紗價之上，姑就十月份之前兩旬而言，現紗最高與最低差價三十九元五角，而標準為三十六元三角，再上溯之以九月最低與十月最高計之相差達五十五元餘，標準僅差四十六元，由此可知此次紗價之漲，非由讓位　投機激漲所致。再就紗廠之原料而論，最近數年間，紗賤花貴，幾成常態，目逐步演進，至上年已達極點，而去年棉產又告歉收，故本年初紗花差價，尚未能脫雖常態也。惟入夏以還，情勢漸轉，一訓識太淺紗銷不斷，存底日薄，一方棉田增加，棉作良好，逼使紗花差價縮小，此後繼續演進，至十月益形顯着。試列兩年間最近四個月標準花平均價於後，以為比較：</p>
<p>月份　二十四年（單位元）　二十五年（單位元）　增加率</p>
<p>七月　三二·五〇　三九·四五　一七·九</p>
<p>八月　二五·七五　三九·一〇　一一·九</p>
<p>九月　三一·九〇　三九·四五　二〇·三</p>
<p>十月　三三·五〇　四一·九一　一五·〇</p>
<p>上列兩年間平均價，本年雖較去年為高，但其增加率遠不如紗價之大，故紗業大目前營業上，其有利可獲，斯可斷言。據近日報載「就上海股票交易所之紗廠股票言，日商上海紗廠九月初旬舊股票為六十七八元，新股票為三十八九元，至十月旬急騰，二十一日舊股票為八十九元，新股票為五十元，舊者漲一成，新股票漲三成。英商怡和紗廠九月上旬為八元三角，至十月達十元，交易日盛價自十元五六角至十九日達十一元約漲二成。崇信股票由十八元漲至二十元。華商紗廠股票，因營業良佳，當然亦漲。惟華廠股票，向不公開買賣，交易較少，漲價情形，不易查明。」則華商紗廠之營業情形，其可順利進行，固亦在意料之中也。</p>
<p>顧紗業為我國民族工業中最重要之一，近年來遭受種種困難，其不頻於全部破產者幾希。本年旣有復興之機，此不但紗業本身，欲求日後繁榮重要關鍵所在，亦我國國民經濟欲求日後繁榮之重要關鍵所在也。蓋我國紗業之衰落其癥結所在，半固由於全國社會經濟之衰落，以及外商之壓迫，半亦由於紗業本身不知努力經營所致。試觀國內外商紗廠，在數年間，在同一處境中，我國紗廠獲利者頗少，而失敗者居多，外廠則年有所獲，且猶孜孜於產量之增加，以及出品之改良，務求消費者之滿意。於技術方面努力於機器之整頓，管理則求合理化，因此產品之成本愈形減省，獲利亦愈大，業務因之日增月盛，故增錠設廠，時有所聞，換言之卽侵略之量力愈增，則華商紗廠之危機日深。反觀華商紗廠近兩年間，停工清理者報不絕書，至增設與增錠，雖逐年均有增加，然與陸續被外人收買者及停歇者相較，恐猶不逮遠甚。往者紗廠之處境至為困難，吾人固不忍於苛求，惟際此氣象昭蘇之期，深冀從事於紗業者，毌再因循舊埆，勿以目前之利自圖，應將本年之所獲，為日後整頓設備之準備，則此　之產品，庶可與外廠互爭長短，此其一。國人創辦事業，其取大弊病，莫如任用私人與缺乏科學管理，紗廠之蹈此弊病者，必難倖免，因此開支浩大，無形增加廠方負擔，及產品之成本，此後應切實整理，以減輕負累，此其二。此後添設新廠，應向內地發展，實為切要之圖，　近年來國內各省努力於　棉事業，　　地皆有棉產，如就地設廠，不此　　之　於較便，且可就地行銷，無形中減低成本甚鉅，而另一方面，更可抵制外廠產品之深入，尤可補憤不平等條約壓迫下之不足，此其三。惟我國之紗廠，資本向稱　弱，不逮外廠之雄厚遠甚故除上述之外，是不得不有望於我國之金融當局以為援助，況金融業本為調劑工商各業金融上周轉之不足，間接輔佐各種產業之興盛，以達到整個經濟狀況共趨繁榮之途，換言之，工商業愈發達，則金融週轉愈形需要，同時金融　，亦愈趨繁樂而愈形鞏固。目前我國工商各業，須仰仗於金融業者頗多，尤以紗業需要最鉅。惟我國金融業當局對於紗業之實際投資，究不敵紗花買賣投機之盛，此殆金融業者鑒於紗廠之經營不善，故相戒不前，而紗廠方面以缺乏資金之援助，遂至無不振作，紗業因之益形衰落，吾人深望懷乎「來者可追」以及「共存共榮」之旨，將我國紗業自今日始，另劃鴻溝，以維護此僅有之民族工業，而　回每年莫大之漏巵，則此次紗銷暢旺與紗價高漲，未始非我國紗業重生之一綫曙光也。</p>
<h3>澈查紗廠財政之商榷</h3>
<p>— 沈榮琳</p>
<p>中國紗廠大都是先天不足，當創辦時所招之資本，不够发展事業之用，一遇艱難時期，即有停頓之虞。雖過去中國紗廠情形及其疲困之原因，不止此一端，但資金周轉不靈，因此不能營運自如，缺乏圓滑靈活之推進，實是中國紗廠重大之缺點。欲補救此缺點，理應設法澈查紗廠之資產負債狀況，使紗廠財政得見眞確。</p>
<p>查紗廠資產分固定資產與流動資產兩種，機械，房屋，基地等項屬固定資產，棉紗棉花棧存物料等項屬流動資產。負債分信用借款及抵押借款兩種，信用借款，極為少數，大抵均屬抵押借款。抵押借款分兩種，一種是固定資產抵押，一種是流動資產抵押。固定資產，因自然消耗及使用之結果，歲月經過，而磨滅損傷，逐漸減少其價值。故折舊與估價問題，實為今日整頓紗廠財政之重要問題，折舊為會計上所必要，則所應研究者，為其計算應採用何種方法，得適合紗廠折舊之實用。關於此種計算，須得（一）原價，（二）壽命年數，（三）廢物價格之三要素，其中壽命年數與廢物價格，在計算上尤為緊要。估價為紗廠經濟技術專家之責任，應用合理之方法，計算其財產，應照現市價究應値幾向，使債權者明瞭其財產之真實價值，而不致受累，則資產負債表得有正確性之表現。</p>
<p>近來創議公司債票與公債同在市面流通，使凍結之資本，得以復在市場活躍，增加金融市場之籌碼，則紗廠尤覺有需要。欲使紗廠股票於資本市場活動，則整頓紗廠財政，實為整頓紗廠信用之初步。待紗廠財政基礎穩固後，然後紗廠經濟機構及其要素，得為大眾明瞭，紗廠債券始能在市場自由流動。如若長此鬆弛，足以搖動全體金融，影響國家稅收，過去我國紗廠之危險，及全社會經濟之動搖，已歷歷可見。為矯正已往紗廠之危險起見，理應提澈查紗廠財政之真實狀況，以使監視。因紗廠為民族工業之重要事業，其資本已達一億元以上，與金融及農民勞工經濟，具有極重要之連繫也。</p>
<p>澈查紗廠財政之後，履行會計法制，尤為不可容緩之事。如減債基金，折舊平準，利息準備金等三項，亟應實行，使紗廠基礎措諸磬石之安。本身健全，則紗廠債券信用，自然騰高，一旦資本市場自由買賣，集游資金供運用，較之借用外資，不可同語。惟因利息太高，致使一切設備，不得不因陋就簡，不能與外廠相頡頏，其損失豈可以道里計哉。</p>
<h3>復興我國紡織業之管見</h3>
<p>— 孫如陵</p>
<p>紡織業為我國主要工業之一，在清光緒年間，上海及各通都大邑，卽有設立，西歷一九一四年，歐戰爆發後，各國因此於備戰，紡織品進口銳減，我國紡織業遂呈蓬勃氣象，歐戰吿終，各國復踴躍在我國設立工廠，互相競爭，當以日英二國為最，依調查所得，日方在我國設立紗廠者約四十家，英則四家，加以各外廠資本雄厚，有政府為後盾，採用新機器，生產力增加，而成本亦可減低，技術精巧，出品優良，尤為我國所不及，其他如不平等條約之束縛，以及關稅之不能完全自主，亦為我國紡織業逐漸衰落之主因，加以歷年天災人禍，農村破產，人民購買力銳弱，且自今春以來，我國因受華北武裝走私之影響，致處境日艱，雖有少數廠家，欲圖振興，終以呼籲無門，不得不停歇，或轉售於外人，凡此種種，非但為我國工業上一大損失，亦我國經濟崩潰之先聲也，茲當我國提倡經濟復興聲中，對於此主要工業，當不能忽略視之，日將鄙人對於復興紡織業之管見，略述於後：</p>
<p>（一）關於政府方面—歷觀世界各先進國，莫不有產業政策，其對於產業之養育及保護，可謂無微不至，如各國在我國設立之工廠，遇有缺乏資本，以及貨物滯銷時，莫不盡心竭力，供給大量金錢，以及劃策銷路之推廣，我國近年，經濟建設雖亦在努力進行中，終以連年內戰，國庫空虛，且百廢待舉，政府已感財力之不足，設欲提出一部分現金，補助工廠，事實上恐難辦理，但紡織業為我國基本工業，其於我國人民經濟生活，有莫大關係，豈可任其自然衰落，而不思補救哉，政府當局，旣無實力之援助，惟對於捐稅之減輕，外貨進口稅之提高，以及可能範圍內使行信用借款等，當能以政治力量解決之，以帮助紡織事業之發展，茲逐一述之如下。</p>
<p>（1）捐稅之減輕—我國稅則，除統稅外，另有地方營業稅等，負担旣重，成本自亦提高，且貨品之出口及原料之購辦，羰賴於交通事業之發展，及運輸之便利，我國交通事業，除沿海各省稍為發達外，內地各處，可謂交通建設，運輸旣感不便，而貨品亦不能深入內地，新近公路建設，雖頗發達，但祇適宜於輕便往來，不能用以運貨，反觀外貨之輸入，除向海關納一次千口稅外，卽可自由通行，無須另納捐稅，負担旣輕，銷路自廣，故政府為拯救此危急紡織業起見，當以減輕統稅及廢除一切苛稅雜捐為主務。</p>
<p>（2）外貨進口稅之提高—世界各國，對於本國內已發達之工商業，莫不採取保護政策，提高關稅進口稅率，以免受同樣外貨之壓迫，我國因關稅未完全自主，故外貨得大量輸入，實行傾銷，國產反目見衰落，故欲謀本國產業之發展，非實行保護政策，提高關稅進口稅不可。</p>
<p>（3）使行信用借款—信用借款在我國行之已久，自金融緊縮後，信用借款，日見減少，非有巨量之抵押，不足以取信，金融周轉不靈，足以阻碍工商業之發啊呢，且在　世界不景氣潮流中，貨品之出售，非一易事，設有規模較小之工廠，因貨品滯銷，卽有發生經濟缺乏之恐慌，勢必至於停工，減工，或至於破產，其於廠方之損失，可謂大矣，設政府機關，在可能範圍內，使國有銀行等，實行信用借款，則廠方一面仍可繼續營業，而勞工亦不致有失業之苦。</p>
<p>（二）關於紡織業本身者—（1）勞資合作—任何團體及國家，其內部必須具有精密之組織，及上下一心之槪念，外來壓迫，方不致受其影響，國家團結力組織散漫，卽有被他族侵略之危機，紡織業亦然，故勞資雙方，都應明瞭目前中國紡織業之危機，資方應力謀勞工生活之寬裕，改良工廠待遇，并提倡正當娛樂及增進勞工智識等。勞方應加倍努力工作，發揮固有之本能，以謀生產品之增進迅速，工潮之發生，實足以阻礙紡織業之發展。</p>
<p>（2）技術之改良—我國紡織業，技術之幼稚，世無甚匹，其主因實由於訓練程度之高低，及訓練方法之不同於他國也，同華工，其在外廠之工作效能，往往有二倍於我廠者，工人技術優良，其成品當亦優良，而銷路亦可擴大，故在復興紡織業中，技術之改良，實佔一主要部分。第一步當嚴格選擇國內有專門學識經駖者，作為導師，訓練一般工作人員，第二步當視彼等之工作效能，而昇以適當之工作，務使人盡其才，物盡其利，并訂定獎懲辦法，使一般工作人員，有向上之心，以上所述，實為改良技術之必需條件也。</p>
<p>（3）使用專門管理人才—管理人才在工廠中，佔有相當地位，對於工業基本智識，應有正確之了解，并須富有辦事經騐，庶不致有物資之浪費，對於勞資之聯繫，其負處理任者，尤宜時刻注意及之，我國工商業等，素有此種弊病，卽缺乏基本智識，卽所用職員，不論大小，皆屬非親莫屬，彼等旣缺乏基本智識，對於所任之職務，當不能如願以償，物資之浪費，勞資之隔膜，皆足以阻礙紡織業之發展，故欲復興紡織工業，於管理人員之取捨，不妨取公開考試制，盡量採用專門人才，使廠力組織達於堅強化，以避免物資之浪費。</p>
<p>（4）採用新機械—機器為生產之需具，近代紡織機之構造，已突飛猛進，不能與十九世紀之舊機械同日而論，非惟出品迅速，且品質優良，而我國所採用者，大部尚屬十九世紀舊物，出品旣遲，質地亦欠佳，自不能在市場上與外貨互相競爭，故為復興紡織業前途計，非迅速採辦新機械不可。</p>
<p>（三）關於個人方面者—當明瞭我國目前紡織業之危機，對於本國之紡織品，宜盡力二輔助并購買之，一切無謂之投機及有害於紡織事業進展者，當改正之，并反其方向使之有利於紡織事業之途進行，考之近來，商人之投機於「公債·標金·」交易，地產者甚夥，而對於生產事業之投資，反視畏途，為我國前途計，當屏除一切個人之自私利心，踴躍投資於生產事業，則吾國未　紡織業之復興，於此亦得一輔助也。</p>
<p>凡上所述，決非一部分力量所能做到，須全國上下一致，努力苦幹，才能達到平安復興之途。</p>
<h3>中國合作事業之考證</h3>
<p>— 陳維藩</p>
<p>考中國合作之發生，遠在周代，已有各種合作社之雛形，足證中國古代固有合作事實之發生，不落於歐西各國之後，請於今之合作分類法，證諸中國固有合作之事實，舉例說明於后，以供研究合作者之參考焉。</p>
<p>（一）生產合作　周朝實行井田制度，將田地分為九百畝，以八家人共同耕種，每家計一百畝，此種制度，與渦文（Owen之提倡合作共有村落，頗相類似。蓋渦文觀念，係「把一國分為若干一千英畝，每一千英畝，成為一區域，內居人民約一千二百人，建築中央機關，裏面包括公共廚房，膳廳，校舍，圖書館，和講堂等；在這共有社會裏面，第個社員，應得像一家人一樣，人人熙熙攘攘，互相敬愛，不得紛爭，每個社員，從事相等的工作，同受相等盈餘的分配」。渦文此種共有村落之思想，不特當時未能林憶蓮，卽至今日，亦未成功，以中國周朝所行之井田制度，互相比較，可知此種生產合作方式之組織，則遠甚於西洋合作事實矣。</p>
<p>（二）信用合作—中國之錢會，非常盛行，甚集合之會友，類多親戚友朋，以信用之集合，而通財之有無，以濟緩急之需，卽外國人士，亦甚注意我國之錢會制度，并稱贊為可效之法則。考錢會之起源，有後漢時人龐公創始說，與晉之竹林七賢遺傳說二種，僅能供酒後茶餘之談資，不足憑信，然新安會之新安名稱，始於隋。以理推測之，會之起源，當在唐時；茲將各種制之名稱及組織形，分述於后：</p>
<p>（甲）錢會此種組織，在中國最為普遍，但，村尚不及城鎭多，蓋以農民按期收入之現款少，城鎭上人經營工商業居多，收入較為活動，故錢會較多。錢會之組織，由需要最切之人農本其平素之信用與人格，發起集合，會友之多少，至不一律，視其需要與能力而決定之。錢會之名目繁多，按人數分者，如三省會，五聖會，七賢會，八仙會，十全會等；按會之性質分者，如搖會，攤會，標會等；按會之時期分者，如年會，季會，半月會，旬會等。</p>
<p>（乙）雞蛋會此種組織，中國北方較多，含有儲蓄之意味。會員多半為農村中之貧苦農民，其會期自六月間開始，至翌年三月止，會員人數無定，每人日繳納雞蛋一枚或一枚以上，由會員公推事務員收集之。次年三月間，青黃不接之時，卽貧苦雇晨，生活艱難之時，卽將雞蛋換糧食或賣錢以維其生活或準備作收獲之費用，以免呼籲無門之困厄。</p>
<p>（丙）堆金會，此種組織，與雞蛋會相彷彿，其辦法，在收穫之時，會員繳納糧食五斗，一石，三石，不等，公推三二人常理保管收集之事務，其資格，必以會員之信仰者為準。</p>
<p>（丁）肉會，此種組織，南方為多，由發起之農民，畜豬若干只，領會員若干人，自正月至十二月，每人月繳納二三角不等。年終本利計算，合購肉若干斤，按照錢數，分配豬肉，供新年大吃大喝之用，安慰一年來之勞苦。</p>
<p>（戊）婆娘會會，此種領會之目的在娶妻，南方較多。無產之農民，對於婚娶，認為莫大之難關，蓋納采行聘等，無不需費甚多，法於是種組織，乃應運而生矣。其組織方，由首會，卽第一次結婚之男子，糾集九個將來預備結婚之男子，年齡十六七歲至二十五六歲止，每人相差一歲，以十年為期，每人每年有一個會員之結婚費。每年一個會員結婚。結婚之次序，以年齡為準，十年以後，會員均已結婚；先結婚之會員且多已生有子女。每逢廢歷正月十五月圓之時，各會員挽其妻子，對對雙雙，入席聚餐，舉杯相蹙！同慶團圓焉。</p>
<p>（三）儲藏合作—中國古代，漢有平倉之設，隋有義倉之設，宋有社倉之設，原為積穀儲倉，以備年荒年之用。此種倉儲之設，雖屬儲於政府，然所儲之倉穀，乃取之於民眾，將來亦散之民眾，頗類於儲藏合作也。</p>
<p>（四）消費合作…中國古時，無所謂貨幣，乃是物之交易，卽以其所有，易其所無，有如消費合作之雛形。又如農民每於年節關頭，集合鄰里親朋，共同販貨分配，如宰豬買油鹽布疋之事實尤多，頗似分配合作也。</p>
<p>（五）保險合作…如壽維會，老人會，棺材會，百歲會等，各省均有此種組織，與人壽保險合作之性質相彷彿，所異者卽此種合作，為死的合作，而非生的合作，且此種合作，并非當今所提倡之保險合作也。</p>
<p>上述中國古代之合作事業，因無完善之組織，良美之制度，以致不能發揚光大，深可惜也！</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 留德醫學博士張君實</p>
<h3>洞房花燭夜的性能問題</h3>
<p>性力發生障碍雖恩愛夫妻亦將同床各夢　促進生殖腺的健壯為新夫婦應有的準備</p>
<p>健全的性能是維持夫婦愛情的柱石，只有美滿的性生活，方能使男女彼此都感到自己為對方的一部，將兩顆整個的心，溶化合一，和好無閒，沒有絲毫的缺憾。性能發生障碍後的結果正與此相反，能够使甜蜜的愛情，轉變成冷酷的厭惡。</p>
<p>健全的女子懷着沸騰熱烈之心，卻遇着個發育不全，陽萎早洩的男人，頓時墮入失望的深淵，這時候，她心中的厭惡悔恨將如何厲害。在同一的情形下，也有壯碩的男婦，熱情奔放，而所遇的女子患着不感症，不能和他相共鳴，失望的愛情冷淡下去。</p>
<p>這決不是一意於肉慾者的感覺，而是一般人所同感的，美滿的性生活是每個人所當享受的。</p>
<p>隨便他們在婚前如何相愛，如何訂海枯石爛之約，只要發現了對方性能的缺陷，自然會同床各夢，感情冷淡的。</p>
<p>為着解除來日痛苦，追求畢生幸福，夫婦不可不在洞房花燭之前，仔細考驗自己的性能，遇有缺陷，應立即治愈。</p>
<p>為什麼男子們為發育不全，陽萎早洩呢？這總是早年耽溺於手淫惡癖之故。不是自己加以摧殘，生殖腺總會好好地發育的。手淫者應該記得：你的輕舉妄動，會妨礙局部的發育而使之短小；因手淫而遺精的應知精關已寬，不免要發生早洩，而衰弱之後，陽萎就將接踵而至。此際應從速服『希米脫氏固精片』以治遺精；再服大量生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，陽萎早洩，即可獲治，局部發育也能重臻完美的。這兩種藥會供給你以充沛的性力，去博得婦人的歡心。</p>
<p>婦女們之患有不感症者，原因大致與男子類似。很多的女子從小就常常玩弄陰部，養成手淫之惡習慣的。久而久之，局部的知覺麻木，性神經也受損害，并連帶地引起月經不調白帶過多。此時宜急服女性生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』，可以治愈，并能使發育轉佳，體態健美，乳房高聳，愈可增加愛情。對於白帶，則可用『療帶靈』為坐藥。</p>
<p>男女雙方而患有淋病，亦足妨礙性能，可服黃色素與伐克合製劑『安敵淋』根治之。</p>
<p>（編者按：『生殖素』與『希米脫氏固精片』均裝鐵盒，切勿誤購紙盒瓶裝之偽藥。）</p>
<p>療養指導</p>
<h3>自療淋病者須知</h3>
<p>— 香港大學醫科學士吳大超</p>
<p>社會中佈滿着性的引誘，到處都是墮落的陷阱，尤其是大都會裏，供人洩慾的地方真不堪勝數。血氣未定的青年，不幸偶而失足，致染上了淋濁，其實并不足責。無奈一般人都以此為不名譽的疾病，不敢張揚，一味乞靈於市上雜藥，纏綿不愈，變成慢性淋病，并能誘發睪丸炎，關節炎，精囊炎等病，後患無窮，不可收拾。</p>
<p>因此，正當可靠的自療方法，確係此輩身入迷途者的指南針。自療當然以採用內服劑為便，流行的內服劑旣多，患者不可不知選擇。</p>
<p>優良的內服劑須有兩大優點，一係效驗確實強大，一係絕無副作用發生。</p>
<p>惡劣的內服劑常能收一時表面之功，而釀成慢性淋病，也常能發生種種流弊，使性神經受障礙。現在醫界人士一致認為無此流弊，確能根治一切淋濁的內服劑，當推黃色素與伐克辛的合製劑『安敵淋』。</p>
<p>『安敵淋』係德國醫學家傑特生博士所發明，確能透膜殺菌，藥力深入尿道後，將全部淋菌殺除凈盡，并澈底治愈一切併發症，增加患者的抗毒能力。惟女性患者，同時多在劇烈的白帶，須兼用『療帶靈』外用藥，以求腔道的清潔。</p>
<p>總之，淋濁以其流毒之甚，擇藥不可不愼，『安敵淋』一藥，余曾用之治愈數千人，無論新老，結果均能滿意。</p>
<p>戒煙常識</p>
<h3>戒煙的困難何在？</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>提起了戒煙，一般煙民都認為係天大的難事，不很願意嘗試。同時，已經着手戒除的煙民，每半途而廢，重新掮起煙槍，甘心過一輩子鴉片煙鬼的生活。這種習見的事實，表示出戒煙的困難。可是這困難究竟何在？有沒有良好的解決方法呢？</p>
<p>這種困難并非別的，只是戒煙通常須忍受些痛苦。鴉片原具有強大的麻醉力，每日吸食，麻醉力即一步步的侵入體內。受毒　的人體組織，好比吃了醉了酒似的，走路也要傾跌，沒有煙的扶掖，不能自由按着常規行動。到了這時，鴉片和吸者的關係很有點像瞎子手裏的明杖。瞎子沒了棒，不免要東碰西撞，跌得面腫頭破；煙民脫離了鴉片，也不免要使全身組織，運行停頓，精神不繼，涕淚交流，渾身發虛，食不下咽，痛苦難忍。</p>
<p>要解除這種痛苦，使能安全戒絕，我們應把吸者的全身組織，看作一群醉人，給些醒酒藥吃，讓他們蘇醒過來，就可以按着常規行動，不勞鴉片扶掖了。生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』就能担任這種醒酒藥的使命。他能够使被煙毒麻醉的器官恢復其活力，增加戒者的健康，精神自然旺盛，不必靠着鴉片的刺激以維持生存。這種從根本上解決煙癮的方法名為培補戒煙法，特點在能使人於不知不覺中自然戒絕。</p>
<p>患者顧人琨，年三十七歲，吸煙五年，深感不便，惟以身體軟弱，恐不能任受戒煙之苦，故徘徊不決，經余投以鐵盒裝之『生殖素』，五星期後，完全戒絕，絲毫未感痛苦，身體健碩，亦元勝於昔矣。</p>
<p>性的開明</p>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<h3>由手淫而來的疾病治療</h3>
<p>…入思春期的中學生多數有耽溺此惡癖的傾向　…手淫過度的弊害對於身體及精神的影響甚巨</p>
<p>所謂手淫惡癖，就是變態性慾的一種，那是由自己用種種方法，以刺戟局部血耽貧於一種之愉快感覺的行為。</p>
<p>然而，這種惡癖的發生，大都在男女思春期中最易犯上。并且這種行為，是只消隱蔽了人的耳目，也無須乎對手能簡便地隨便在什麼時候，任何的地方，都可以實行。大多數行將入思春期的男女中學生，往往有着耽溺於這種不自然性的惡癖之傾向。這實不能不認為是出乎教師和父兄的意想。</p>
<p>一般地關於性慾的事項，儘管是一切的人們所同有，而且是非常重要的問題，但是，世人總把性慾當做單純的卑猥的行為，紊亂風俗的事情；而不肯去赤裸地研究。然而，在實際上性慾實演着那作為我們人類精神生活之基本動力的重要任務，日常生活的種種表現，都受着那潛在於根底的性慾力的強力支配，這是我們已經知道的事實。而且，在性慾發動的初期，或者已受到惡癖的一切弊害時，如果能指導其抑制或治療的方法，則因手淫而來的工切疾病，不至於傾向於惡化之途。</p>
<p>手淫，乃青年所普遍罹患的惡癖，所以這裏先記其由來，述其毒害，并且提示如何始克達到其有效的挽救，而敢煩識者加之一考。</p>
<p>手淫過度的弊害，對於身體上及精神上所起的疾病，種類甚多。其最普遍者為神經的衰弱。因手淫之後。遺精症必不能免，精液為人類健康的基礎。精液遺洩過密而枯竭，則耳鳴，頭痛，失眠，健忘，精神不安等現象叢生。久之遂即爆發性的衰弱症。陰萎，早洩，性器細小等症。屢見不鮮。關於治療之法，介須戒除手淫，然後以鞏固精關，制止遺精的『希米脫氏固精片』服之。服後大約在兩星期左右，即可將遺精完全治好。在治療之時，應即同時服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以治其因手淫所促成的種種神經衰弱症及陰萎，早洩，局部細小等性的疾病。無人不知生殖腺為性的主要腺器，故服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』實為收效最速的合理治療。</p>

<p>患者陶嘉銘，年廿五歲，浙江紹興人，旅居上海已八年矣。職業瓷器，住址北西藏路安宜邨九十一號四樓。（主訴）—十七歲時發育，在校因受劣友所誘，即染手手淫惡癖，甚至有時一夜三次，不至一年，精神大損，體弱異常，故遺精頻繁，神經衰弱症遂不能免。耳鳴。頭痛，失眠，健忘，入夜心悸，盜汗，白日精神萎頓，四肢酸軟，後雖知害力戒手淫，然因躭溺仍不能自拔。廿三年春結婚，始將惡癖戒絕。然性神經衰弱不堪，房事舉而不堅。患早洩症，第二次房事即陰萎異常。（現在症狀）—遺精症每星期至少三次，面色蒼白，肌肉削瘦，目光失神，腦力遲鈍，早洩，陰萎。（治療之法）—每日施行電療一次，診得陶君精關鬆弛異常，乃以『希米脫氏固精片』鞏固其精關，以制止其遺精。此外所有之一切神經衰弱症及早洩，陰萎等弊害。則投以真正生殖腺互製劑『生殖素』，使生殖腺轉弱為強。不到五旬，遺精即止，性弱亦愈。同時面色紅潤，肌肉較前發達矣。</p>
<p>（二）性器官細小的有效治法</p>
<p>患者，趙泉生，年廿二歲，安徽人，執業於本埠當典。（主訴）—素有手淫惡癖，至今仍未戒治，不僅精神恍惚，腦力遲鈍。且性器發育不全，復有包莖，每夜有遺精，遺後有時必醒，有時則完全不知，（現在症狀）—睪丸萎縮，狀如鴿卵大小，性器之小，令人驚異，復有第三度包莖，而神經衰弱症亦烈。（治療之法）戒絕手淫，電療，施手術割除包莖。行攝護腺按摩，嚴格指導其攝生術。以『希米脫氏固精片』止其遺精。以生殖腺互製劑『生殖素』補其精力，助長其發育，增進其營養，鞏固其健康基礎。經過三星期，遺精首告停止。五星期之後。性器之發育增長十分之二。繼續治療，至九星期左右。體重增加十二磅，神經衰弱症完全消滅。而性器之發育，令人十分滿意，蓋已較原大小增長一倍矣。</p>
<h3>病後失調</h3>
<p>編輯先生：敝人身體素弱，且年邁多病，醫藥不斷，入冬更甚。今夏又病兩月，故已骨瘦如柴，　力求滋補，體力尚難復元，今秋自得同居介紹以『生殖素』補之。服後效力驚人，精神驟然充足，肌肉亦異常發達。此誠神效無比矣（張萍）</p>
<h3>胃痛如割</h3>
<p>編輯先生：今夏因吃西瓜太多，加之冰淇淋又為敝人所嗜飲，故前患之胃痛症。發作尤烈，痛時如受刀割，自知無可藥救矣。且消化異常不佳。不料敝友王君介紹服以『胃痛靈』之後，竟得疼痛根治，同時因服『健胃素』故食慾轉佳（翔雲）</p>
<h3>白帶淋病</h3>
<p>編輯先生：余夫性喜冶遊，身染白濁，余尚在鼓中，施被傳染，始知底蘊。致余罹患兇惡之白帶，色帶淡綠，流量甚多。夫始驚恐。乃購得黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』同服。以治淋病。余并外用『療帶靈』以止白帶。祇服用四星期，淋病與白帶完全治好。余知同病者頗多故敢介紹（孫攸鳳）</p>
<h3>乳房萎癟</h3>
<p>編輯先生：敝人素有月經不調症。故身體失健，乳癟異常。毫無健美。余頗憔慮，旋見報載女用『生殖素』可發育乳峰，調整月經。乃購服兩盒。服後月經果被治愈。同時身體強壯，乳峰逐漸高聳，此誠吾輩婦女之良藥也。（沈一貞）</p>
<p>美容研究</p>
<h3>中西女子健康美之比較</h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>現代人的審美觀念大異於昔，於面貌的秀麗之外，更注意全身的姿態美。姿態美以曲線畢呈為美，而曲線之最令人注目的　為乳峰。從前人以胸前變峰突起為恥，在現代則以乳房萎癟為醜。</p>
<p>再有什魔能具有更尖銳的勾引性？高聳豐滿，有彈性的乳峰，有誰見了能不怦然心動，無怪今日的女性都注意於此了。但就這一點，以中國的女性和西洋女子比較，實在是望塵莫及的。世界上惟有康健強壯的婦女，方能得良好的發育，使乳峰高聳。中國的女子體格素弱，還有許多人受制於父母，自少緊束雙乳，阻其發展，連帶地施壓迫於心臟和肺部，使全身衰弱，易罹月經不調和白帶等病。這樣的女子如何會得到良好的發育，如何會使乳峰高聳。看到了昂首挺胸，乳房隆然的西洋女子，自然要覺得相形減色了。</p>
<p>怎樣云補救這缺憾？怎樣使中國女子得到時代的健美？唯一的方法當服以女性生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』，促進生殖腺的活動，發育即可轉佳，乳峰驟然高聳，臀部豐腴，雖係瘦弱枯瘠的女子，也立能獲得健康美，與西洋女子立在一條水平線上。除此以外，本劑并能使經期準確，全身健全，在患有白帶病者，須另行外用『療帶靈』以根治之，白帶若含淋濁性，宜兼服黃色素和伐克辛的合製劑『安敵淋』。</p>

<h3>骨節酸痛的合理有效治法</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>關於本症的發作，因為原因甚多，我想受骨痛所苦者定必眾多。其最易罹患者，厥為操勞過度與體質孱弱的人，原因由於上述之人，抵抗力異常薄弱。故腰背酸痛症，幾不能免。其次為平時之寒暖不常，瘋濕內蘊，亦為促成本症的主因。此外的荒淫無度，致淋病餘毒未凈。則能惹起種種的骨節酸痛症，此之調血份不潔的骨痛。治療之法。略有區別，如為勞操及體質孱弱之故。應服以生殖腺互製劑以補之，然後再服以功能袪瘋，除濕，清血，預防動服硬化之骨痛特效藥『強斯登氏肌痛片』，則骨節頓吿舒適，腰背亦輕鬆異常。如早年　曾涉足娼妓，罹過白濁者。必須同時兼服黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』使積累的白濁餘素，澈底掃清，方能收其卓絕之功效，如能依這途徑治療，則雖病至半身不遂，亦不難靈然而愈。</p>

<h3>酒瓶做成的防毒面具</h3>
<p>— （庸言）</p>
<p>當一九一五年四月二十二日歐戰正酣的時候，德國人首先不顧一切的撕碎了海牙會議的禁用毒氣公約，而用毒氣向協約國軍隊進攻。那時英法二國的軍隊，明知依靠那神聖的公約是不能阻止毒氣的攻擊的，所以不得不採取有效的手段來對付，當時前綫的軍隊就立卽趕製了許多奇形怪狀的防毒面具來應這個急。</p>
<p>這許多奇形怪狀的防毒面具中，有一種是用酒瓶做成的。這種面具是用一個酒瓶，敲去了瓶底，再在瓶肚裏裝上一些潮濕的泥土；使用的時候，把口凑在那瓶口上，空氣經過了瓶裏的濕土，而吸進口裏，濁氣則用鼻管吐出。當然這種面具的效力是有限得很的，總算聊勝於無罷了。</p>
<p>但是我們的防毒面具呢？</p>
<h3>愁和酒</h3>
<p>— 白流</p>
<p>酒有香檳酒，啤酒，葡萄酒……大多是所謂「上等人」飲的：且外國來路貨多，似乎在這提倡國貨的年頭不好談外國來路貨，這樣，自不得不談國貨的酒。</p>
<p>常灌在耳朵子裏的酒名，當然要算「紹興酒」了，什么「元粱」，「高粱」……最有名的要算山西的「汾酒」了，那滋味的雋美只有自己去嘗才知道！</p>
<p>吃酒，那一個不高興，一天的倦疲不堪，幾杯酒可以大為興奮啦！古來的文章家，詩人，簡直可以在酒裏裏過日子李白的詩句：「長歌吟松風，曲盡河星稀，我酬君復樂，陶然共忘機。」又如「月下獨酌」詩，都在深夜時飲酒，自得其樂，本來李太白是個大酒仙：據說皇帝送他喝酒護照，便可無錢而喝遍天下的酒了。唐朝詩人的：「白日放歌須縱酒。」「葡萄美酒夜光杯。」「何當載酒來，共醉重陽節，」等的詩句，可以證明他們在酒裏過日子是無疑了。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰在「難道這是應該的麼？」這短篇小說內有寫勞苦工人的星期日的生活：「到了禮拜日那天，許多工人得了工錢，出去洗澡休息。有時不去洗澡，卻跑到酒館飯店裏去喝酒，喝得大醉才罷休。可是到了明天禮拜一，一淸早就要做那種工作了」因為勞苦的人，物質精神的種種不足，便在「以酒澆愁」的情狀下，得到了滿足，快樂，雖然是滿身臭氣呢？</p>
<p>日本的生物學家邱淺次郞說：「社會制度根本不改良，酒類是永遠不能禁掉的！」那種話，真是實話，美國向來禁酒，近年來也畢竟也解除酒禁了。因為酒是勞苦的人們唯一的安慰者！呵杜牧有「落魄江湖載酒行」之句，可說酒是無產階級的最大的恩物子。因此都市市鎮的生意淸淡而或關門，而酒業酒館卻因而增多，這可使酒老闆笑逐顏開了。</p>
<h3>阿土酒店</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>給不景氣籠罩着的鄉村，一切都衰落着，謀生，確是一件不容易的事，開店，自更是難若登天了，但在我們鎮上的阿土酒店，卻有一點例外。</p>
<p>阿土酒店，在十年前尙不過是街頭鋪了幾條長板，三五隻矮矮的小凳，把着幾盆肥魚大肉與荸薺五香豆，祗一二甏紹酒高粱，微微吐出一點香氣來，顧客們，自然也祇有幾個鄉農與工人。</p>
<p>阿土是一個年輕的小伙子，他一身就兼着跑堂，燒手，賬房等職，因此生涯冷落得有點可憐，一天到晚也沒有一個時候能得到休息，他老是眼睜睜望着許多顧客，在對街的一家大酒樓中，整批的來，整批的去，但他并不羡慕與妒忌，老是現着一天到晚不停的笑容，他祇是說：「這攤子委實不够他們大人先生的一頓晚餐啦！」</p>
<p>但現在阿土酒店已是婦孺皆知的宴會勝處了，當華燈初上時，他那裏總是佳賓滿座，呼魚喊肉，而熱鬧得異乎尋常的，顧客呢，也大半是「長衫階級」者，回顧對街的大酒樓，轉門可羅雀，沉寂得像已失去生命一般，使外鄉來的人，莫不為之嘖嘖稱奇。</p>
<p>其實，阿土酒店仍是很平凡的，菜，酒，人，一切都不變，祇不過由攤子換了店面，因此，有很多人懷疑着阿土酒店的店面風水好，但我們問阿土呢，阿土祇是笑而不答。</p>
<p>我們鑒於阿土酒店的髮展，覺得棉紗綫絆倒石牌樓，實在有實現之可能，同時，農村經濟的衰落，在這裏也可以略見一斑。</p>
<h3>「太白遺風」</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>凡是嗜杯中物的人，似乎總知道上海那些小範圍的酒店了。　其文丐之流，他們的觴詠處或是聚餐所，往往採取於此。也可謂是最老的顧客。</p>
<p>那些小酒店，除了照例一個橫照牌外，櫃台上另外加上一個直裝的照牌，寫着「太白遺風」四個大字；這種陳設，幾乎成了酒業最普遍的趨勢。於是譬如那店是民國時代開設的，甚至今天開幕的，然而也缺不了這種名不符實的裝潢．但是「太白遺風」這四字，究竟是怎樣的解釋呢？經了我猜想的結果，總脫不了遺傳和迷信吧了，因為中國人素來是喜故步自封的，以為社會是聖神不可侵犯：因此雖是幾百年前的風俗，但在我們這社會裏，始終還保持它固有的風氣。</p>
<p>有人說中國的社會太矛盾了，其實社會本身并不矛盾，而是人類前後相反呵！因為一部份人已經趨向於歐化，另一部人，卻終保持着固有的國粹，所以意見上的衝突，勢必難免。</p>
<p>又有人主張改革社會沒法改良的，因此你也留美觀察；他也東渡研究。結果呢？回來還是在矛盾的社會中嘆息！而把從前一切的計劃和在無聊的生活裏，　英雄無用武之地。原來我國復古的風氣，實在太濃厚了。雖有天大的本領也沒法改良呢！</p>
<h3>飲酒難</h3>
<p>— 南丁</p>
<p>酒，是一種有刺激性的飲料，可以使人興奮，嗜飲的人很多。在宴會內，因了使客人興奮而歡樂起見，酒便成了不可缺少的副品。</p>
<p>我國的酒，在古時夏禹的時候，已經有了「戰國策」战帝女令狄儀作酒而處。可見這時，一已發明了造酒。到了少康一代，便造了秫酒，「世本」有狄儀始作酒憀，變五味，少康作秫酒。這是高粱酒的起原。至現在，酒的種類，不下幾十種，除了我國原有的紹興，高粱等之外，又有舶來各種洋酒，如白蘭地，口利沙等，名目繁多，酒味也有濃淡的分別。但是無論是一國原有的酒，或是舶來洋酒，都因了內中含有一種酒精質製成，酒的濃淡，便因了所含的酒精質多少而不同。酒精質卻又可分為兩種。一種是植物質酒精，從植物內提出，飲了并無害處，不影響身體的康健。別種是鑛物質酒精，是從鑛物內提出，對於身體有極大的損害，甚至可以妨害生命。鑛物質酒精，味烈而價廉，因此不道德的釀酒家，並非把植物釀成，用鑛物質酒精作為原料，因味烈而成本低廉，容易獲利。但是飲酒的人，卻受了絕大的害處。而且現在市上，以鑛物質酒精為原料的，不知多少，有劉伶癖的人，遂發生了飲酒難的恐慌。所以飲酒的時候，第一要點，便是先明瞭所飲的酒，是否由植物釀成，不然，還是不飲的好，因有生命的危險。</p>
<p>成釀酒，提出酒精的植物很多，如米，麥，山芋，菉豆，高粱，玉蜀黍，葡萄等，都含有很多的酒精。紹興酒是米釀的一種。麥製的酒，最着名的便是啤酒。葡萄釀成的有葡萄酒和白蘭地。山西汾酒，洋河，都是高粱提製。其中最濃烈的是汾酒，含酒精百分之五十，次白蘭地，百分之七十四，再次惠司克，百分之七十三，紹興百分之十七，啤酒最少，祇有百分之四。但是近年的酒，如高粱，紹興，劣質葡萄酒，劣質白蘭地等，都雜入鑛物質酒精，使人不敢嘗試。除非是可靠的釀酒公司所製，如張裕公司，因了他在煙台，有幾百万里的葡萄場，可以保證沒有鑛物質酒精攙入，方能放膽暢飲。不佞也是有劉伶癖的一人，不過因了飲國貨酒和避免鑛物質酒精起見，祇飲煙台啤酒，和那可靠的紹興。</p>
<h3>酒話</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>事業之餘，追求娛樂。都市擬攘，下流所歸。短中見長，寗採麯藥。頌「勸君更盡一盃酒，與爾同消萬古愁」之句，有不覺心曠神怡，寵辱俱忘者！余非酒人，偏多酒話，匪敢習近頽唐，亦曰賢乎，博奕爾。</p>
<p>余最不能飲，而於酒性之淸濁醇漓新陳到舌輙辨，質諸內家，十不離九。昌黎文：「千里馬有，而伯樂不常有。」余將自詡為「酒伯樂」，惜乎未能用之。則世雖有相士之伯樂，而士不見用，不亦徒然乎？念之重有感矣！</p>
<p>余不善飲而頗健啖，海上列肆，盡各地之長，叢全國之味，余幾足跡遍諸，將謂余雖非酒囊，差成飯袋？偶讀張岱「陶庵夢憶」所記，則知雅人非盡酒仙，亦復饕餮，余其庶幾無媿乎爾。志之以見同情，且賞其文之搖曳多姿也。</p>
<p>余家自太僕公稱豪飲，後竟失傳。余父余叔能飲一蠡彀，飲糟茄面卽發顛。家常宴會，但留心烹飪庖廚之精遂甲江左。一簠進，兄弟立啖之盡，飽卽自去，終席未嘗舉盃。……</p>
<p>山人張東谷，酒徒也，每悵悵不自得。一日，起謂家君曰：「爾兄弟奇矣！肉只是吃，不管好吃不好吃；酒只稽吃，不知會吃不會吃！」二語頗韻，有晋人風味。而近有傖父載之於集曰：「張氏兄弟　賦性奇哉！肉不論美惡只是吃，酒不論美惡只是不吃！」字字板實，一去千里，世上真不少點金成鐵手也！</p>
<p>劉伶，世推為千古第一酒人者也。嘗云：「灭生劉伶，以酒為命，……」信斯言乎，彼宜若何自珍其有酒之生！乃彼居恒攜僮負鐘相隨，命之曰：「死便埋我！揆其意自示赴酒之勇任與櫬决戰之觀。雖然，命與酒拼，不幾與亡命之徒相伍乎？飲，雅事也。何須劍拔弩張，多見其自暴自棄？遮莫神昏措妄，但憑諸胡帝胡天？</p>
<p>袁中郞自標吝飲，而有「酒政」之訂，條分縷　，大有朱虛侯軍法從事之嚴，是固旁觀者淸與？乃弟小脩以解飲名，日「遊居杮録，中所自陶寫，情理兩當，乃頗有可采之處，如云：「生平飲酒不喜盡飲，一飲終日昏倦，夜飲亦不喜多，飲多則夜寐不安，次朝神思不爽，甚則助發淫嗔。明知其為苦趣，然居人世，親友以此為禮，見余素有飲名，一席不飲則主人訝之，不得已強為之飲。……常居城市，終日醺醺。旣醉之後，淫念隨作，水竭火炎，豈能久於人世哉？」又云：「性旣擇酒，而酒不堪飲者最多，然不容不飲；勉強吞噬，有如服藥！未能逃世，旣不容戒；易流之性，又復雜節；面柔趣深，更復奚辭？其實，敗我之德，傷我之生，害我之學道者，萬萬必出於酒無疑也」夫唯嗜好，利弊相參，戒易守難，又人情之通病；世人往往諱莫如深，而小脩公然自供，直言無忌。「酒助淫嗔，豈久於世」之語，尤閱歷有得之譚，足闡先聖「惟酒無量，不及於亂」之旨。斯乃酒也而庶幾進於德焉與？</p>
<p>有嗜飲者，年五十餘卒，將驗忽蘇，曰：「余疾瘳矣！頃適冥聞，見巨甕二，封識是余姓名。一已啟封，存酒及半。此余之飲料，須盡之而死耳。」遂復縱飲二十餘年。一日，語所親曰：「余殆將死乎？昨夢三甕酒俱盡矣！」不數日，果無疾而卒。事見「槐西雜志」。信乎瓊漿天祿，人力難施，一飲一啄，數由前定與？則吾見其人酗飲而輒至　吐狼藉，酒之入肚落腸卒無幾者，所哇非其祿之故與？是亦命中虛有其表而已矣！暴殄天物，其酒可惜，外強中乾，其人不尤可憐乎？可為一噱！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>友梅把身子緩緩的站起來，兩手按了桌沿，向夢蘭臉上看着，臉上沒有了笑容，眼睛注視着不轉動，很久才道：你能不能吐出胸中的苦水來呢？夢蘭嘆了一口氣，把頭垂了下去？友梅於是走到他身邊，挨擠着坐下，兩手捉了夢蘭的手，將臉貼了他的臉，低聲道：你不大相信我嗎？夢蘭依然不作聲，帶點微笑。友梅于是又趕快的回到對面椅子上去，將那盃茶舉了起來，高平了鼻子，對他道：夢蘭，我們乾這盃。我若是對你有不忠實的地方，我沒有人格。他說着，舉了那盃子，不喝，也不放下。夢蘭也只好站了起來，將茶杯子端着笑道：梅，你這是激將法呀。但我們這樣好的朋友，你不應該用這種政治手腕呀。友梅依然，把杯子舉着，板了臉不肯答話。夢蘭笑道，沒有法子，我就陪你喝乾這盃吧？但不必當一種什麼盟誓。友梅道：我自然喝，把這盃茶，當為一種盟誓，你怎麼樣，就看你待朋友的情分了。他說道，真像喝酒的樣子，把那盃茶一口氣喝乾，而且還反轉杯子來，嚮夢蘭照了照盃。夢蘭出於不得已，也就只好同乾了一盃茶。兩個人相對望着，倒是黯然了。那窗子外面的雨管，卻是沙沙地響着，激動人的心弦。夢蘭好像有了什麼感動一樣，放下茶杯子，跑到友梅身邊，將他一隻手挽着，拉到床上并排坐着，於是很沉着的呌了一聲道：梅，我現在對你說了，你原諒我呵！說着這話，隨時向友梅的臉上看去。見他把臉色沉下來，連鼻子裏的呼吸都平緩了許多，他留心的程度，是可想而知了。在兩小時以後，夢蘭的話，就說出了八成了。然後偏了頭，聽聽窗外的雨，已不是那樣沙沙的響。只是檐溜下滴滴嗒嗒的，發出那不斷的雨點聲。桌上的那煤油燈，也像減少了許多威力，在白碌罩子裏，發出那陰沉沉的白光，格外加增了一種淒涼的意味。窗戶雖然是關閉的，但是在那玻璃上面，一條條約四下流着雨水的痕跡，似乎像人在流淚。窗子也微微的露着縫，在那縫裏，向裏面透着涼氣，這涼氣侵襲到了人身上，讓人起了一種不可言宣的思想。（九七）</p>

<h3>維持官電之尊嚴</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>官電亦稱為政務電，在發電次序上列於一等，在報機傅遞時，例應提前，電面曰官，電而稱為政務，就電言電，官電之地位，不可謂非尊嚴。</p>
<p>官電之尊嚴何在？厥在官電之本文，係完全涉及國家政務，共關係之重大，興時間性之重要，為別種電報所不能及，惟其如此，故報局於同時間收受各種電報，其中官電之拍發或遞送，必在其餘各報之前。</p>
<p>我人重視官電，尊視官電，實則數十年來，官電已漸失其重要性質，與夫尊嚴地位，揆厥原因，乃由於往昔軍閥，不依定章發寄官電，而以官之地位發官電，祗須一官在身，不問其為私事或公務，盡以官電出之，於是官電由雜而濫，結果擁塞綫路，積壓報務，而電政經濟，亦因官電之欠費，不能維持，幾瀕破產。官電之重要性旣失，官電之信譽亦隳，人之視官電也，公私不分，綏急莫辨，則所謂尊嚴者亦僅矣。</p>
<p>國民政府成立後，對於濫發官電，曾有限制之辦法，對於官電之付現，亦有通飭之明令，一反從前積習，實卽維持官電尊嚴。從政者應知非政務不能發官電而官電本身旣屬重要，按例均係提前發送，更不必在電文之前，標以「加急」字樣，以免多此蛇足：至於付現一層，關係電政命賑，亦賴以維持全國通信事業者，其應照章繳納，自無待言，如此，官電旣入軌道，電政亦見光明，在全國統一之下，得充分表現官電之尊嚴，正所以昭示各從政長官之奉公守法也。</p>
<h3>將近開辦之寄還電報收據辦法</h3>
<p>— 炯</p>
<p>十二月一日起實行</p>
<p>發報人對於本人所發電報於何時可以送達收報人往往甚為關心。現行國內電報營業通則第一百十一條內訂定之送妥通知」辦法，卽係為適應上項需要而設。例如發報人如欲收報電局於電報送妥後，立卽將送妥時日　用電報通知本人者，得於電首書明「電知或（＝PC＝）標識，另照尋常電價目加付六字之報經，電局卽可照辦。倘發報人僅欲收報電局將送妥電報之時日用郵「函知或（＝Pcp＝）標識，並加付單掛號郵遞資費。惟上術兩頊送妥通知辦法，均係由收報電局於電報送妥後逕用公電或郵函通知發報電局轉知發報人。發報人仍未能目睹收報人親筆簽名或蓋章之「收到電報回據」未免美中不足。且我國社會上一切人事往來，凡涉及銀錢或契約者，不論在法律方面或會計方面，均甚注重單據，故一般人郵寄重要信件，往往採用雙掛號辦法，俾對方郵局於送妥該項函件後，將收信人親筆簽名或蓋章之回執寄還本人。吾人對於重要函件，旣有寄還收信人回執之需要，對於關係重要之電報及匯欵電報，自必期望電局能將收報人簽名或蓋章之回執寄還，以資憑信，電局為適應社會人士之需要起見，現已訂定「電報局寄還電報收據　行辦法」一種，自本年十二月一日起實行。茲將該項新辦法摘錄如下：</p>

<p>二、上項電報遞到目的地電局後，由電局特備收到電報回據　一份，連同來電派差送交收報人，除照例請收報人在電報封套背面之回單上簽字蓋章，以便電局留存備查外，並請其另在該項特備之回據上簽字或蓋章後帶回電局，以便交郵掛號寄交原發報地點之電局，查明發報人住址派差送還發報人，由發報人在該差所持之送信簿上簽名或蓋章為憑。</p>
<p>三、發報人如同時有發往同一城巿之電報二份或數份欲採用回據辦法者除每份電報均須書明「回據或Rpcp納費標識外，僅須預付郵資一份。分送雷報亦同。惟分送電報如欲採用回據辦法者，應於各個收報人住址保稱之前分別書明上項納費標識，例如「　分送　回據　南京中山路（676）號丁子鴻　回據　太平路（20）號大昌祥」，否則電局僅向冠有「回據」標識之收報人取具收據寄還。</p>
<p>四、下列各項電報不能適用寄還收據辦載之規定：</p>

<p>上項新訂寄還電報收據辦法，對於附贈禮券之紅素兩種之交際電報，亦甚為適用。蓋吾人交由電局拍發附贈禮券之交際電後，深望該電及禮券均能迅速送達收報人。但收報人收到上項交際電及禮券後，往往因婚喪大事過於忙碌，不及立卽答謝致勞發報人之懸念。倘發報人採用上項新訂寄還電報收據辦法」，則收報電局當日卽可將收報人親筆簽名或蓋章之「收到電報回據」寄還，卽便收報人因事繁不能立卽答謝，亦可證實該項交際電報及禮券均已送妥，不至有勞懸念矣。</p>
<p>此外，發報人發寄上項「回據」標識電報時，應在去電紙內詳細書明本人之姓名住址以便發報電局收到收報電局寄還之收到電報回據」後，可以派差按址投送。否則如將本人姓名住址書寫欠詳，則該項收到電報回據」，難免發生無法投遞情事，此點應請發報人特別注意者也</p>
<h3>再述電話用戶應行注意之點</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>巿內電話用戶使用電話時，應行注意之點，迭在本刋發表，　者觀感所及，茲再補述如左：</p>
<p>一，電話機裝設地點，在原則上當然可以由用戶指定，但遇下列幾種地方，照章涌裝置，或裝置後，必須搬移者：</p>
<p>甲，所裝之機，足以受到雨雪的侵害，或潮濕過多，容易損壞機件，以及足以防礙聽話等處：</p>
<p>乙，靠近電燈綫路，或火爐，電灶旁邊，容易發生危險之處：</p>
<p>丙，一宅有住戶數家以上之過廳，走廊，穿堂，容易損壞話機，使用戶感受賠機損失之處。</p>
<p>以上地方，若已經裝置話機，請速向當地電話局或電報局，報請移機，以免發生機件障碍與賠累損失。</p>
<p>二，大凡有營業性質之用戶，如商店，酒館，戲院，茶樓，旅社，以及娛樂場所或公眾出入繁多之處，話機外面，應加做木箱一個——長方形，　話機略大，旁穿一個大孔，可將送話器及受話器，掛在外面，並在必要時，可以下鎖，以免機件被竊。</p>
<p>三，住宅話機，不宜裝設在離開臥室過遠之處，因為日間旣有不能卽時呌到受話人之煩，夜間復恐有來話久呌不應貽誤事機之害。</p>
<p>四，話機决不可使兒童玩弄，因為共電式之聽話器，（俗名聽筒）一經摸弄，便致絞結，蓋繩內銅絲，旣極細微，若絞結，容易斷折。且使兒童玩弄，足以引起要號誤會。</p>
<p>五，電話往來最好由主人或主婦親自執行，（此係專指公館住宅而言，商店及其他公眾塲所除外），非不得已　，切不可假手僕役，卽請客，應酬等小事，亦宜由本人親自執行，旣可表示敬意，目免受人　蔽。</p>
<p>六，在大雨大雷之時，最好不要打電話，因為空中此時若有天電，容易感應傅機上，危險堪虞。如不得已，必須通話時，應避免觸及金屬各部份，以求安全。</p>
<p>七，倘巿內發生火災情事，而其地點，離我住址甚遠時，不必向電話局探問，蓋話局此時交換室換綫工作極忙，所有救火機關和公安機關，都要由局中分別通知，以便派救火機來馳救，和派軍警來維持秩序。卽經發話詢問，亦不能得詳細答復。倘火災在近處發生時，應卽通知救火機關告警，但對於親友來話詢問，不必故事張皇，俾免對方着急。</p>
<p>八，話機旁邊，宜預備小册　本，並鉛筆一枝，如自己不在家時，有人來話，由他人代接之後，可將來話電機號碼，及其簡略事件，記在上面，以便自己歸家時，查閱辦理。</p>
<p>九，凡素常往來通話之電話號碼，宜自塡一表，巾機在旁，免得翻閱號簿。</p>
<h3>交部電台第一屆兒童播音競賽會參觀記</h3>
<p>— 沈愛蓉</p>
<p>廣播電臺的使命，在於用最迅速的方法，來傅遞重要新聞的。原是輔助社會敎育的利器。可是中國的廣播電台已商業化了，它是以宣傳貨物為主要任務，而把原來的使命——傅遞重要新聞，輔助社會敎育，——成為附屬品了。上海各廣播台，自從交通部上海電報局實行審查劇本，取締節目，積極整頓以來，空中肅清一番，耳朶旁就覺得清靜多了。交部廣播電台自八月三日起舉行兒童播音競賽會，其目的一方面為兒童闢一空中樂園，一方面收播音敎育的實效，這是一件辦法很好而很有意義的事情。我為了要明瞭這會的內容怎樣？方法怎樣樣？特地在星期一下午六時許，到南京路外灘沙遜大厦一三七號去參觀一番。</p>
<p>交部電台在沙遜大厦一樓，裏面共分三間，一間是機器房，間是辦公室，一間是播音室。播音室的一切佈置設備，很够有上富麗堂皇四字。橡皮地板上舖着厚厚的羊毛地毯，四壁懸着紅色的絲絨帷幔，雕刻得很精巧的紅色大花板上，懸掛着五只紅紗的宮燈。一只很講究的鋼琴，蹲在右面墻角前，幾只克羅米的少發，齊整的立在紅絲絨帷幔的前面。只紅木的長桌，尊嚴似的站在距離窗口不多遠的室中央，近窗口的一面的桌子邊，放着龐大的紅木太師椅。近窗口的左牆角前的小桌子上，放着播音調解機，話筒等機械，以及留聲機等，旁邊一只較小的桌子上，有一只無綫電收音機和電話等，這裏是專為報告員應用的。播映室中間還有一只話筒，這是專為播音者所應用的，另一隻是備用的。整個的播映室裏，充分的表演出高貴和富麗的情調。</p>
<p>在六點一刻的光景，來了二位小朋友，穿着一色的的白色布西裝，戴着白帆布闊邊的的帽子，很是齊整美觀，這二位都是來參加播音競賽的。一位是朱美瑛小姐，一位是王翠雲小姐，天眞活潑，非常可愛。</p>
<p>六時半開始播音，二位小姑娘輪流站在話筒前，用嬌脆柔軟的鄒音唱着，朱小姐唱的是賣油條，王小姐唱的是張姥姥的莊子，二位小姐又合唱蝴蝶姑娘，最後王小姐又唱了一只睡的贊美都十分動聽。</p>
<p>那天是播音競賽的第五天，在過去四天有劉宏文（講童　飛車）劉琪芳（唱吹泡泡）顧　德（講故事義犬，唱大地行軍曲）余維盛（講怎做個好兒童，唱母親）解洪生購小石頭）解秀珍（唱鋤頭舞歌）鄭眾琴（唱你要那一抱）朱　娟，洪根娣，朱美瑛，王　雲合　努力歌，許多小朋友播音，以後還有許多小朋友逐日在該台播送童話，故事，歌唱等，如候問清，「我的新生活觀」，王漢民將「科學的孩子」，朱美瑛，陳鳳桂，王漢民三人播話劇「慈愛」，都是很有意義的。</p>
<p>我雖然看過小朋友們的播音，但仍不十分明瞭兒童播音競賽會到底是怎樣的，所以就去詢問該會的主人王人路徐章立　位先生，承二位先生詳細地告訴道：「播音競賽，是為兒童敎育實施的捷徑，因為現在各台所播送的節目，全不適合兒童的個性和興趣的，兒童們收聽了無聊俚俗的節目，對於他們的身心，有極大的影響。所以我們創辦道個兒童播音競賽會，選擇對於兒童身心有益，且是兒童喜歡聽的故事，童話，歌唱等，呌兒童自己播送給兒童聽，收效一定比成人播送的要大得多，因為兒童們最容易受兒童的感化的……凡是參加，並且一人同時可以報名參加數種競賽，並不限一個節目，這樣可以充分的表現他們的特長，不埋沒天才。競賽的種類分（一）演講，（二）歌唱，（三）辯論或對話，（四）話劇或歌劇，（五）其他。競賽完後，參加競賽的兒童們名次高下，是由本台（交部電台）所聘請的評判員，以及聽眾們投票的多寡而决定，……凡參加播音的小朋友，都有獎品贈送，這不過是增加小朋友們的興趣而已。』</p>
<p>最後王先生又告訴我：『這次參加播音的學校計有萬竹，務本，和安，復旦實中，巿中心實小，敬業，工部局女中及附小，養正，典業，南洋模範，育材，明達，勤德，承餘等巿立私立十餘校，參加播音競賽的兒童，大約有二百左右』</p>

<p>中國華洋義賑救災總會十五週年紀念特刋</p>
<h3>本會簡史</h3>
<p>本會會名為另華洋義賑救災總會（在辦賑各省社會人士，成以「華洋義賑會」之簡名稱本會。）為內政部給照立案之特種慈善團體。成立於民國十年。先是民九北五省大旱，各地中外人十紛組賑團，從事救濟。翌年災情减輕，賑務告一段落二九月二十一日，北京國際統一救災　會，召集各地華洋賑團代表，舉行聯合會議於北京，（今北平）籌商賑務。　會者有北京，上海，天津，濟南，開封，太原，漢口，等七會代表，咸以　國災情頻仍，賑團不相聯絡，救災防災，俱感困難。當時議决，由七團　共同組織一永久性之中央救災機關，以便保管各團體義賑餘欵，統籌全國救災防災事宜。十一月十六日，各團體代表復開會於上海，正式通過組織中國華洋議賑救災總會。擬定章程設總　務所於北京，公推梁如浩君為會長，艾德敷看為總幹事，負責執行會務。各地華洋賑團，一律改為分會，藉明系統，以籌辦賑濟天災，及提介防災事業為主要會務。總會成立至今時止，由七會擴充至魯，豫，晉，鄂，湘，陜，贛川，貴，雲，甘，綏，及揚子顧問委員會分會，計共十三處。</p>
<p>本會為一國際組織，無宗敎政治之界限。由分會推派華洋代表各一人為本會瞳渦，每二年舉行常會一次，討論會務。决定事業方針。並由常會推舉不超過會員半數之社會熱心士紳為額外會員，喪助會務。設會長一人，副會長一人，秘書一人，（總幹事兼）華洋司庫各一人，悉由常會推選，任期二年，是為本會最高職員。更由常會推舉會員六人，華洋各半，連同上項職員共十一人，組織執行委員會，主持會務。平均每月舉行會議一次。此外並組，各種專門委辦會，分負審核之責。</p>
<p>總事務所之組織，以總幹事為其主幹，分設總務，稽核，農利，工程，徵募，五股，執行一切會務，並在南京，上海，安慶，南昌，四地先後分設事務所各一處。</p>
<p>本會辦賑方法，力求其合乎科學精神，經濟條件。不欲使災民倚賴成性，永墮窮途。實行以工代賑。除對老弱殘疾，予以相當施捨外，（一）對災民不空施金錢；（二）對災民不空施糧食；（三）壯丁使之從事相當工作，養家糊口；（四）糧食缺乏之處，以糧食為工資；（五）工資按工作單位，核實施給。此為辦賑原則之大槪也。</p>
<p>防災事業，尤所重視。蓋以救災急於　時，金錢糧食，徒滋　費，而防災可消弭禍患於未來。故本會處成立以還，多致力於防災事業。於工程方面，則興辦水利，公路，修　河堤，於農利方面，則舉辦合作，提介鑒井。前者屬於救濟防災，後者趨重農村建設，改善農民經濟。</p>
<p>十五年以來，所辦賑務河災事業，以及賑欵收支賬目，逐年均有中西文報告書，印送各界，以昭徵信。茲當椒五年工作告一段落之際，特將會務一般情形綜合統計附列圖表若干種，向國內外之留心近代荒政者一報告焉</p>
<h3>十五年來之中國華洋義振救災總會</h3>
<p>— 王正廷</p>
<p>中國華洋義賑救災總會，忽忽成立十五年矣。此十五年中，外蒙各界之贊助，內賴同人之努力，範圍日形擴展，事業年有恢張，所營水利交通合作諸端，與夫災荒之救濟預防，迭承社會稱許，政府獎勵。鄙人忝長是會，實深欣幸！茲値十五週年紀念之期，爰將成立之經過，組織之槪况，施賑之原則，已往之工作，條分縷析，敬為社會人士告：</p>
<p>（一）成立之經過　本會成立於民國十年冬季，時當華北大旱之後，國內華洋合組之義賑　體，約有十餘處，但各白為政，不相聯屬，翌年振務結束，各團體代表數次集會，共商善後，僉以欲消弭災荒，須有事權統一性質永久之機關，從事策劃，預為防範，因議决設中國華洋義賑救災總會於北平，就原有各華洋賑災團體改為分會，此為本會成立之始。</p>
<p>（二）組織之槪况　本會係中西人士合組之慈善團體，絕無政治宗敎畛域之分，經向國民政府內政部呈准立案。主持會務者為執行委員會，其委員會名額，中西各半，設總事務所於北平。　幹事之下，分設總務，稽核，農利，工程及徵募五股，常川辦事。山東，河南，山西，陜西，甘肅，綏遠，湖南，湖北，江西，貴州，雲南，四川等十二省，各設分會；南京上海等處各設事務所。揚子流域之賑務，設有顧有顧問委員會，駐滬辦公，除籌辦江蘇浙江安徽三省賑務外，凡揚子江流域以及華南一帶，未設分會之處，所有賑災防災事工均由其統籌並顧，而駐滬現務所，並附設頻繁義務委員會，恊助徵募捐欵。</p>
<p>（三）施賑之原則　本會成立以來，鑒於往昔辦賑者，往往不知思患預防，一旦天降鞠兇，始奔走呼號，募捐乞賑，而惟施衣佈食，為臨時消極的救濟，其賑欵則隨放隨空，糜費金錢　逾千萬，卒無補於善後，徒養成災民之依賴性是以本會宗旨不限於義賑而注重在救災不僅救已成之災更注重防未來之災，此防災之目標為建設，凡開渠，鏧井，築路修堤等事，與夫便利民生之種種設施，均認為防災要務，所謂「建設救災」主義是也。至其施賑原則，業於民國二十二年，舉行第六屆年會時，規定如下：</p>
<p>（一）遇有災情發生，當地財力顯然不能記止多數生命之損失，而其情形又不適於辦理工賑時，本會應舉辦急賑。</p>
<p>（二）本會辦賑，應儘量採用以工代賑，從事建設工程，及短期低利貸欵辦法。</p>
<p>（三）本會之主要事工，卽為繼續提介及實施各種預防災害計劃，計分以下兩類：（甲）築路，灌溉，修堤，掘井，門墾，水利等建設工程事業。（乙）舉辦信用，運銷，供給，各種合作社，改善農村經濟；改進農業方法；提倡家庭工業，使農民逐漸脫離困境。</p>
<p>（四）在救災及防災兩方面，主要責任，仍由政府及地方當局負之；本會則處　於襄助地位。本會賑欵，應根據上列標準而加以支配，俾能收最大之效果；換言之，卽欲引起當地政府及人民之踴躍參加，與負責之决心。</p>
<p>（四）已往之工作　本會十五年來，辦理急賑及各項防災工作，均依此原則而進行；平時努力建設，預防天災，遇有災荒，輒奮勇救濟，以急賑治其標，工賬培其本，量情措施，並行不背，統計用欵已達五千萬元有奇，備載歷年報告茲不詳述。所有已往工作，擇其犖犖大者，略舉於後：</p>
<p>（一）開渠—陜西渭河流域之涇惠渠，係由本會與陜西省政府合力開浚用欵一百三十萬元，農田資其灌溉者，不下六椒萬畝。綏遠陸托　　之民生渠，興辦於民國十八年大旱之後，費時兩載，西部始告完成，可灌田二十五萬英畝。此外如河北省之石　水渠；南京淳化鎭之蓄水池；以及在各省所開之渠。不勝備舉。</p>
<p>（二）鏧井—河北山東兩省，地勢高峻，連年亢旱，損失殊鉅，而民九為尤甚；內倡廣義鏧井，以盜灌溉。由本會籌集基金，陸續貸與農民，從事開鏧，先後共成五千七百二椒七口，每口以灌田椒六畝計，共可灌溉農田九萬餘畝。</p>
<p>（三）浚河—本會以疏浚河道，可防禦水災，故從事此項工程，已達二百發和十英里，而本年舉辦工賑疏浚之山東汶上縣泉河尚不在內。</p>
<p>（四）築堤—本會歷年在江西，湖北，河北，河南，山東，安徽等省，先後築成之堤防，計長九百零四英里。</p>
<p>（五）築路—本會鑒於交通與防災救災關係之密切，故積極提倡修築公路，在國內椒四省中，統計先後築成拳路二千零二十八英里，修理舊路一千四百四十八英里，而工程最鉅者；厥為西蘭公路，該路橫貫西安蘭州之間，為西北交通要道，共長四百八十英里，用欵達五十餘萬元。築成大部路基山道後，由國民政府經濟委員會接造完成。他如湖南貴州兩省公路，均由本會首倡築造，迄今車輛暢行，交通利捷，行旅稱便焉。</p>
<p>（六）合作社—本會為國內提倡農村合作社之先鋒，此為社會所公認。初僅在河北一省試辦嗣漸擴展至湘，鄂，皖，贛，陜各省，至民國二椒五年四月，經本會直接指導而組成之合作社，共有二千八百六椒五處，貸與各社之欵，共達七十三萬零七百五十元。</p>
<p>（七）急賑—本會雖竭力從事於建設防災事業，而於猝發之水旱災荒，救濟仍不遺餘力；如收容災民，辦理平糶，及佈施衣食醫藥，舉辦災民敎育等。十數年來，我國災荒迭見，而元氣調未大傷者，本會與有力焉。</p>
<p>觀上各條，本會經過情形，工作成績，可見一斑。而事業進展，正未有艾，要其為社會謀進步，公眾圖福利，則為最大志願。願各界人士，共同贊助，俾資進行，國計民生，實利賴之。</p>
<h3>本會蘇北築路開山情形</h3>
<h3>今後會務計劃大綱</h3>
<p>義賑會一向沒有紀念過牠的週年，因為平平泛泛的年年開一次紀念會，實在太無意義。今年是牠的十五週年，故小有舉動。用意是在結束旣往，啟發未來。</p>
<p>義賑會已往，讀者多少知道。牠是救濟與防災並重的。可是拿牠已往的成績來看，牠的工作是偏重在防災一面。牠所建設的道路恊助的農村合作等事，都是從防災兩個字面上做出來的文章，亦就是使得牠在整個鄉村建設運動中，略有貢獻的事業。</p>
<p>若說因為牠辦了那些事業，事實上就預防了多少天災，無形中就减少了多少餓死的人，誰亦不敢下一論斷，而且筆者敢於大膽的說，除了這五六千萬元賑欵直接受惠，以及所修復之堤圩，直接受其保障之田地等，可以按圖索驥估算之外，在這多災多難之國家，牠的防災工作，九牛一毛的比例來比喻，恐怕還嫌得誇張些，所以養賑會正面的防災工作，寫在一個報告書裏，或是書在一張地圖上，看來雖是花花綠綠，亦有可觀，但牠工作的意義，實不在此。</p>
<p>義賑會有幸得很，得與當代的許多社會服務團體，如平敎會；職敎社……等，從以前的軍閥混戰時代做起，做了十五年，好容易造成一種風氣，轉變了國人的目光，鼓起了多少人建設的勇氣，技術方面，人才方面，亦多少為國家預儲了一些材料，可以供今日政府社會的不時之需。道是義賑會意外的收穫，亦卽是牠最大的成功。以牠慈善團體的資格，得在今日鄉建中有一份子之貢獻，更是牠最大的光榮。</p>
<p>現在我們已經踏進了建設時期了。政府的努力，即以建設為依歸。近年來公路的建設，水利的請求，合作事業的推行，年年俱有顯著之進步。義賑會此時，與其繼續舊業，再做那些從前以為必需此後為不必需之工作，反而虛糜賑欵於重複之事工，甚至紊亂，系統，阻碍整個計劃之進步，還不若奉行義賑會一貫的服務宗旨，另闢所以為人民服務之途徑。義賑會認清這個環境，所以决定將以往的事業做個結束，對將來的會務重定方針，要借十五週年紀念的機會向社會作一報告。</p>
<p>對於合作事業，義賑會一下手，就取定試騐態度的。在沒有合作事業的地方，做些「開荒」工作則有之，但是大片段的推行，義賑會自知沒有這個力量，擔當不起這份責任，所以始終不敢以之自任的。至於發見新問題，本擬出方案去實地試行，因此而得到經騐等等事，義賑會是極樂意做的。這種技術試騐，自有牠的價値，所以義賑會此後仍將集中力量。向這方面做去。現時已把推廣性工作交還給政府機關去辦了。這是農村合作一方面。</p>
<p>此外義賑會將勻出一都力量，將賑濟的技術，多加研究。天災流行，無歲無之。莫說建設事業，尚在各方努力進行的我國，災歉在所難免，就是建設事業早甚發達的國家，賑濟亦有必要的時候。近年來美國的救濟事業，辦得轟轟烈烈，就是明徵。賑濟旣是　種不可避免的工作，吾們便應研究賑濟的技術。</p>
<p>義賑會此後的工作方針大槪如此。就是在平時為擴大建設的效用，恊助人民增加生產的力量，貫澈牠防災的主張。到天災時要想做到能全體動員馳赴災區，眞正能從水火中去救人，充分發揮賑濟的效力。</p>
<p>這個「三元計劃」已經義賑會二年以上的考慮討論，新近方始决定實施。以十五週年之紀念為新舊會務方針之分野。牠一向想「到人不到之處，做人不做的事」牠此後的設施，當然　要保守着這個見解去實現，工作方針，雖要隨着環境。略有變更，但牠為人類服務的宗旨，是保守持勿替的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>空屋捐</h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>上海的市面，因爲受到不景氣的「特種蕭條」，和外力的侵蝕交相煎逼，已一天不如一天了。這是很顯明的盡人皆知的「事實」。爲了這緣故，年來上海市內卽使是繁盛的商業中心如南京路，公館馬路，北四川路等相繼倒閉的商店的數目，非常驚人。八月中旬某通訊社記者曾作一統計說：上列馬路的空屋的佔十六分之一到六分之一。對這數目，我們能够不驚懼嗎？當時，爲了這一驚人的數字，引起了多方面的感慨。本月十日本報刋載的一段「公共租界納稅華人會委員，鑒於徵收空屋房捐，足以减低房租，繁榮市面。茲法租界已實行，特建議納稅會轉工部局亦繼起執行，以維市面」的消息，也可以說是那時的「感慨」所引出來的「結論」之一。不過，關於這「結論」的正確與吾，似乎還有可商榷的地方。</p>
<p>記得當時由「空屋」的恐佈而引起的，曾有一時的再刺戟减租運動，使房租减低，一般商店在成本上可以比例减低，在他們當然以爲「一經减低房租，必羣起租屋而營業。」（十日本報載納稅華委原函）但是，我們如果把眼光放大一點，把市面衰落的原因，無論遠因或近因，都「通盤打算」一下，我們必定會看到一般人不「租屋而營業」，並不單純爲了租値昂貴，當然，租値昂貴也是原因之一，但只是「原因之一」而已，並不就是解决了這，也就是稍爲减低了房租，便可以把市面衰落完全解决。這是我們應該特別鄭重指出來的。</p>
<p>在八月廿七日的「談言」筆者曾爲「空屋」的恐怖說過幾句話，記得大意是：我們對於目前開店的老是「召頂」和「關門」的理解，應該先「深刻地了解市面衰落的基本原因」。那，不消說，國難的加緊被深刻化，和當哄動全國的走私正「長驅直入」的搗進我們的要害，使我們微弱的民族工業，連「最後掙扎」也成爲徒勞。那麼，換一句話說，在無保障下面，我們的商業也只好「束手待斃」，市面在這情勢下，又怎會興盛呢？</p>
<p>現在，事隔尙未到三月的現在，情勢也向前更推進一步了，民族危機因綏邊告急已到最後又最後的關頭了，三月前的洶湧一時的减租運動尙且挽救不了市面的江河日下；何况現在事後，更重新用「空屋」捐作嗎啡針，再刺戟來一次减租運動嗎？</p>
<p>我們贊成一切挽危局於臨崖的辦法，但有一要求，便是這辦法需保証是行得通而無害的。反之，只講來頭頭是道，實際只能更陷入困境的，那是不行的。</p>

<p>（本報特寫）崑山縣農業推廣所，它是一個復興農村，開發農業的拓荒者，關於它成績和過去情形我早已聽到過，但因爲一向向沒有機會，所以沒有去實地訪問過。昨天，我趁了遊馬鞍山之便，就特地去訪問了一趟：現在我不妨將印象所得，拉雜地寫在下面，以供研究農業問題及關心農村建設者之參考。</p>
<p>該所係由縣立，所以一切經費亦由縣撥給；但該所的創立是在民國十七年間，初爲崑山縣立蠶桑塲，旋於二十年改組爲農業改良塲，又至廿二年始改今名。現在他們已有自耕地一百六七十市畝，內中有塲基地十一餘畝，旱田十多畝，水田七十多畝，桑園三十多畝，林苗圃六七畝，池塘二畝左右，其他二十來畝，租出者則祗有七八畝而已。該所除此實驗種植塲外，尙有推廣區三處：第一區在大西門外朱家浜村，第二區在陸家浜站東莊村，第三區在安亭站徐公橋鎭，而在楊湘涇磧礇村方面還有一個指導所。</p>
<p>至於現在已經進行推廣的改良種方面以稻作爲主要作業，其種類以三一四種，三一八種，及一時馨，蘆稈白，飛來鳳，處暑黃，帽子頭，光頭黃，曲玉等爲多數，其餘如烏香粳，天落黃等則因收成上的關係，故推廣不多。决則爲麥作，但麥的種類較稻爲少，所以該塲推廣的亦只有小麥，火燎芒，小紅芒，南京赤壳，武進無芒等若干種。</p>
<p>此外，還有林苗桑園的推廣，三年來也已頗著成績了。</p>
<p>養蠶方面，他們除了飼育示範蠶以資推行外，還設立了三處育蠶指導所，專門派員巡迥指導。至於畜牧部份，則牛，羊，猪，鷄，鴨，鵝，蜂，魚等改良種，及優良種皆在推廣之例。</p>
<p>講到推廣的施行方法與步驟，首先由該所向外選辦作物的優良品種，在自己實騐塲里的土地上試植，速續二三年，其成績確較土種佳者，便在示範區里正式種植示範，並向農戶推廣。但所推廣者祇限於特區農田，不過其餘農戶願自動換種者，該所亦可供結種苗。</p>
<p>凡被特的之農戶，須絕對受該所指導及勤勞誠實；特的後，不但種苗係由該所供給，且可由該所隨時派員指導改進耕種方法，及防治蟲害，灌漑等事。收獲時並須將作物展覽比賽’其成績優良的給獎，遇有較土種减遜的則由該所補貼。而造林養魚，該所尤其竭力在推廣，並且備有大批林苗魚秧，以便分發農民。</p>
<p>他們平常對於工作方面也很認眞，像辦理農事詢問，編印農業淺說畫報，告訴農民植樹的利益，方法，治蝗淺說，合式秧田說明，治螟圖說，及治螟要點等。舉行鄉鎭保長及農友談話會，演講農業常識，或交換改進意見。此外，舉行全縣農產展覽比賽會，聘請專家組審查委員會分別審查出品成績，按甲乙等名發給各機關團體之獎狀或獎品，以資鼓勵。聯合防治螟害：由該所斟酌天時氣候，擬具洽螟計劃及獎懲辦法，呈縣府轉飭各區公所，責成鄉鎭保甲長，督促農民依照該所指導之治螟方法切實防治，以免損害作物。修築圩岸，以防水患。繁植樹林，俾資調勻氣候旱水。</p>
<p>據說去年他們的推廣區還不過一千畝，今年卽稻作一項已有四千畝了。他們預定計劃，明年大的可推廣到四萬畝，經常開支，過去也不曾滿過一萬元，此後當不致超出預　的。</p>
<p>今後的計劃，他們除了預備大規模的良種推廣與改進外，並擬提倡合作改良農業經營，舉辦電力灌漑排水，提倡養魚合作，共同防治螟蝗等蟲害，訓練大批管理戽水機人材。這一切計劃。有的他們已在開始辦理，有的却正在進行中。</p>
<p>現該所有辦事員七人，及戽水機師二十多人，自建房屋二十多問，船一隻，畜牧塲一處，養蠶塲一處，養蜂塲一處，魚池一個。各種作業用具，圖書，儀器，標本，藥品等均備。</p>
<p>我們訪問過了該所，在回上海的火車中，回憶到剛才參觀和訪問的印象，覺得這樣的農業推廣所每縣都需要設立，甚至，每個鄉村都應該設立。我希望各地的當局起來仿行，這於救濟農村復興農村或許較有實益吧！</p>
<h3>秋的原野</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>七月初七夜里下起暴雨來，第二天仍是瓢波似的繼續着，有時灰濛濛的天空亮一陣，孩子們就在屋簷下跳着嚷：</p>
<p>「亮一亮，下一丈。」</p>
<p>一直到三天頭上，才像息了怒似的，換了細茸茸的小雨點，人們都擔心山水冲下來。莊稼都很嫩，水一過頂，秋後老婆孩子都只有張着大嘴哭了。男人們走到河崖上去，河水果然漲了，不過水上沒有泡沫，不像山澗里流下來的那麼髒，每個莊稼漢的脊背上都冒着冷汗，倒抽口氣對自己說；</p>
<p>「可別再下了。」</p>
<p>夜里雨停了，人們瞇細着眼睛向上瞅，星子像打禾塲上散佈的穀粒，嵌滿了藍滴滴的天，有一點風使人想不起拿扇子來。誰的心都安然的沉下去，想着那大大的惹人笑的禾穗子。</p>
<p>太陽晒乾了田里的積水，高粱拔着節子望上長，穀子莠齊了穗頭，一個月却沒見到一星雨，禾包等待那充足的雨水來定漿。人們又盼着多少下一點吧！可是河水給晒乾了，兩岸的淤泥裂了老大的縫，像小畚箕樣的掀起層厚泥皮來。在一個黃昏時，也許忽然黑雲跑馬般的遮住半邊天，半夜響幾聲沉雷，天亮仍是一滴雨也沒有，藍森森的天空上，一個金黃的太陽又漸漸爬上頭頂。</p>
<p>高粱在瘦稜稜的杆子上晒着紅米，棉花挺着紫色的梗子，向撒來的陽光笑，紅色黃色的花朵在密叢叢的綠葉上蓬鬆着，穀子非常可憐的爬滿了黑色的膩虫，葉子被吃光了，細小的穗梗上像腫起來似的浮動着無數發烏的小束西。莊稼漢們覺得讓啃了心的想哭，誰什麼法也想不出，求過雨，那個神像使毒毒的太陽晒了好多天，神座頭上挿的柳枝都枯了。葉子雀糞零落了一身，也再沒人把它抬回去，農民們不敢恨天，一年中所耗去的氣力尙沒使他們絕望，他們把整個美麗的好兆頭注視那紫油油的棉秧，跟那吐着黃色纓子的玉蜀黍。</p>
<p>村里有扎嗎啡的藥針鬼，也有沒吃少燒却帶着一大串孩子的母親，他們不嫌棄莊稼人抱怨的小穗頭，在人靜的深夜，他們涉水游過小河去，檢那熟透而穗頭大的高粱，截下來弄成小小的捆子，背在肩上，不幸給那勞碌了一夏的耘田人看見，一隻胳膊從此折了，或一灘烏血淌在焦乾的土地上，都是說不定的事。</p>
<p>高粱漸漸熟了，每一家把糧食打下來，槓到簍里，看那縐癟的像小墳頭似的一堆，便嘆口氣。玉蜀黍全乾了庫，因爲天永沒丟一滴雨，一家挨一家的秧都給乾死了，玉米正是灌漿的時候，莊稼人眉頭縐得緊成個疙瘩，把一個玉米剝光了揑着，粒子破了便綫一般射出奶漿來。</p>
<p>「就能煮着成呵，要不，也得讓吃白食的偷走了。」</p>
<p>田野上慢慢的凈了，只有濃雪般的棉花在九月的秋風中盛開着，每一片棉田里有一所小草屋，門邊坐着個抱鳥槍的看棉人。</p>
<p>秋日的原野，漸漸蕭條了。</p>
<h3>紫葡萄</h3>
<p>— 方潔</p>
<p>走在霞飛路上，偶然經過了一家水菒店，看見里面堆着很多的圓紫可愛的紫葡萄，心里很想買點回去吃，但摸着袋子是空空的時，祗好熄滅了這個念頭，最後仍投了一瞥貪婪的眼光纔鬱悶地走開去。</p>
<p>這使我回想起一件有趣味的故事：在今年夏季里，我還寄寓在一家朋友家里。這朋友的父親因爲是一位有體面的鄉紳，所以也常常歡喜和同樣有體面的鄉紳打交道。</p>
<p>恰好他家里也種着幾株紫萄萄樹，在五六月里就已經結得果實纍纍的覆滿了一棚架，凡在那近邊走過的未免都有點饞涎欲滴。這情形給這位朋友的父親發覺了，於是他馬上就嚴密戒備起來，祗要有入從那里走過，他總要說：「你們別去動那紫葡萄啊」！這樣，便連許多走過的爲了要洗刷自己的嫌疑起見，總很快的就走過了。</p>
<p>朋友的父親很高興，接着他便開始計劃：某人該送些給他吃，某人該特別多點，某人是可以馬虎一點的……</p>
<p>但出乎意外的是在一個夜晚，紫葡萄仍然遭了竊了，他立刻很憤怒，痛駡這些入的卑賤下流，甚至爲了一點饞嘴，居然肯在道德上犯罪！自然還有很多同情他的人陪着駡：這些昏蛋簡直缺乏品性上的修養！</p>
<p>我常時也很詫異，並且也有點憐憫，這批人爲什麼竟至於全然不擇手段呢？</p>
<p>過後，紫葡萄熟了，按着預定的安徘，許多人都嘗到了鮮味，我以客的地位，常然也受到一份的賞賜！</p>
<p>但朋友的父親仍很憤慨，他依舊念念不忘於失竊，按照他的意見：紫葡萄雖無足輕重，而風俗之日趨澆薄却足堪深憂！</p>
<p>可是直至現在我才豁然大悟了：這位朋友的父親的深憂有什麼用呢？道德的力量未必能鍜鍊品性上的修養吧？假如那家水菓店里沒有人，當時我也一定會去偷盜一次的。</p>

<h3>Eve of the Suiyuan Battle: Bandit Forces Invade Taolin Territory Yesterday Morning; Bandit Aircraft Drop Eighty Bombs, Intense Artillery Fire; Six Failed Attacks, Our Positions Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Guihua) Minor skirmishes in Sui East for the past three days are bandit forces probing with force, all of which have been repelled by our defending troops. Starting at 10:00 AM on the 15th, bandits with 2,000 cavalry and infantry, eight aircraft, and dozens of mountain and field guns, invaded Honggetu in Taolin territory. Local militia and garrison troops rose up to resist. Bandit aircraft dropped eighty bombs, and the artillery bombardment was very powerful. Under the cover of intense land and air firepower, the bandit troops launched six attacks, all of which failed. Our positions remained steadfast like mountains. They retreated at 6:00 PM. Heavy snow fell on the night of the 15th, and fierce fighting will continue. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: The curtain on the Sui East battle has officially been raised. At 9:00 AM on the 15th, mixed puppet army infantry and cavalry forces of over a thousand were discovered at the Honggetu position on our Xinghe and Jining front, surrounding our left flank and attacking fiercely, with four enemy aircraft dropping bombs from the air. Peng's Brigade of our 1st Cavalry Division is calmly fighting back. There is great panic here, and everything has fallen into wartime conditions. After 6:00 PM, security is extremely strict. The military police along the Fengzhen northern section of the PingSui Railway are especially vigilant. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) There is no activity in the Sui North area yet. It is reported that Mongolian troops from the Xianghuang Banner who arrived at Bailingmiao are now moving from the temple to invade the Western Gong Banner. Since the death of Prince Shi of the Western Banner, Princess Shi has formally taken over the management of the Zhasak. A telegram arrived in Sui on the 14th, stating that she has ordered a thousand Mongolian cavalry under her command to defend the territory of the Western Banner. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) A certain party has already printed a large number of proclamations to reassure the people and tax tickets for the five counties in Sui East in Zhangbei. Continuous small conflicts along the Sui East border have been confirmed. A major battle is feared to be not far off, but there is absolutely no fierce fighting like what is being rumored. Zhao Chengzhou has returned to Datong from Pingdiquan. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: 1. The puppet army's objective is still Sui East. The bandit troops previously transferred west to Bailingmiao secretly turned back midway, using this force as a decoy to confuse our intelligence. 2. The bandit troops are harassing Sui, with the northern route attacking Taolin and Zhuozi Mountain, and the southern route taking Xinghe and advancing towards Fengzhen. Jining's defense is solid, and the bandits will avoid the heavily defended areas and harass elsewhere. 3. A certain party's Kawakishi Brigade and the Zhang Junzhe division of the puppet Rehe army are being transported from Duolun to the Baochang front. This army seems to be a reserve force. 4. Three aircraft from a certain party came to Liuhuzi Village in Xinghe at noon on the 13th and dropped four bombs at low altitude. Although the explosions did not hit any important targets, no one was injured. 5. Damiling Sulong is now leading Mongolian cavalry to defend the Twelve Sumu. Da's patriotism is firm, and morale is high. 6. The puppet troops of Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, and Yin Baoshan are stationed in Shangdu as a rear guard. Military vehicles are constantly on the road. On the night of the 14th, some bandit cavalry divided their forces and harassed the Taolin and Xinghe left flank defense lines, and spied on our Honggetu defense area. They engaged in fierce fighting with our outpost troops, but were unsuccessful and retreated. 7. Military preparations at all our Qian and other defense areas have been completed. Communication between all front-line generals is also quite convenient. The bandits may launch a large-scale harassment around the 20th, and we are paying attention. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Puppet bandits and Mongolian troops from Chabei have all changed to wearing red armbands since the 14th. The general offensive order for attacking Sui was issued by a certain party on the 13th and will begin on the 18th. Enemy aircraft have been constantly scouting our Xinghe and Taolin areas in Sui East these days, and have dropped bombs in Xinghe. It is heard that the enemy has transported poison gas bombs and is preparing to use them against us. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gui Sui telegram: A skirmish occurred at Hongge'ertu, north of Taolin, on the night of the 14th. Puppet bandits harassed several times, but our army firmly defended its positions and repelled the bandits. There were bandit aircraft dropping bombs near Xinghe the day before, but there were no casualties. Damiling Sulong is commanding at the front lines in the Twelve Sumu. Sui East and Sui North were relatively quiet on the 15th. Over a hundred military officers from a certain party, all dressed in Western suits, arrived at Bailingmiao from Chengde on the 13th and immediately changed into military uniforms. They went separately to the bandit puppet armies of Bao Yueqing, Jin Jiasan, Li Shouxin, Gan Ying, etc., to give military instructions. There is also information about an offensive towards the Suiyuan area around the 20th. However, tens of thousands of households are suddenly gathering in Shangdu, Bailingmiao, and other places. The demand for all kinds of grain, fodder, and military supplies is huge, and they are in a desperate situation, unable to raise funds. After discovering the ambitions of the puppet bandit army, the Sui side blocked grain and fodder from crossing the border. Therefore, all supplies for the bandit puppet army are being transported from Chengde. As a result, long-distance buses between Chengde and Shangdu are constantly on the road. However, due to a lack of fuel, the morale of the bandit puppet army is quite unstable. They would prefer a quick battle, but military preparations are not yet complete. Our defenses are extremely solid, and they dare not act rashly. Therefore, they are caught in a dilemma. Several aircraft from the puppet bandit army in front of Pingdiquan flew to scout, causing unrest among the people, who are moving outwards in droves. The PingSui Railway is crowded with travelers. As Sui East has eased slightly, the number of passengers traveling to and from the area has returned to normal. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Suiyuan said that there have only been contacts between sentries at the front lines of Taolin and Xinghe in recent days. Aircraft from a certain party occasionally scout over Pingdiquan. In the past two days, there have been heavy trucks and large carts carrying coal, oil, grain, and other supplies to Duolun, Guyuan, and the four districts, escorted by soldiers from a certain party, gathering in Shangdu via Ba昌康保 from Duolun, and gathering in Shangdu via Miaotan north of Guyuan. Residents in the Zhangbei area are fleeing to Zhangjiakou in droves. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: Five aircraft from a certain party flew low over Jining on the morning of the 15th, then scouted our defense area in Zhuozi Mountain, and flew away without dropping bombs. Also, several military officers from a certain party, who appear to be the highest-ranking instructors of the puppet army, have now arrived in Shangdu to direct military affairs. However, the puppet army is gathering in various counties in Chabei, and food is in short supply. The bandit army is short of supplies, so they are slaughtering Mongolian banner cattle and sheep to provide rations, which has caused resentment among the Mongolian people. Long-distance buses to and from Duolun and Chifeng have all stopped passenger and freight transport and have been converted into military supply vehicles. Due to the unrest in the Sui area, the long-distance buses to Xin Sui have been changed to irregular services. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: Zhao Chengzhou, commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, executed two Han traitors, Li Leting and Zhang Lelin, who were acting as spies for the puppet army, by firing squad on the 12th. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sources say that a hundred military officers from a certain party arrived in Duolun from Rehe a few days ago, exchanged their clothing for Mongolian robes, and joined the bandit troops of Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, and others to carry out activities. Transport between Pingdiquan and Baotou is very busy. The puppet army has sent soldiers disguised as merchants to buy a lot of coal in Kouquan and Xiahuayuan. Judging from the situation, they seem to be actively preparing for military action. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although aircraft occasionally appear in the skies over Pingdiquan in Sui East, the entire Suiyuan region remained peaceful yesterday, and no battles occurred. Now that the cold winter has arrived, the "Manchu" Mongolian army preparing to attack Suiyuan may delay its advance. Heavy snow fell in Beiping last night and has not stopped this morning. It is heard that there is also heavy snow on the PingSui Road. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming, Chairman of Chahar Province, went to Baoding from Zhangjiakou on the 14th to meet with Song Zheyuan and then came to Beiping. (25th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mongolian people in Bailingmiao Jiabusi used to store food and coal for the winter every year, but this winter they are only preparing for temporary military needs and are not preparing for the winter. The puppet bandits claim they will spend the winter in Sui. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sui Education Community Launches Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>(Guihua) The Sui Education Community established the Provincial Education Community Joint Association on the 15th and decided to donate a day's salary to purchase leather clothing for the front-line soldiers. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fellow Suiyuan natives in Beijing, deeply concerned about the dangers facing their hometown, are greatly impressed by Fu Zuoyi's determination to serve the country and the front-line soldiers' vigilance and steadfastness. They convened a fellow-countrymen's meeting a few days ago and resolved to donate funds to comfort the front-line soldiers. Students from various schools, facing financial difficulties, are reducing their meals and saving money. It is learned that students from Suiyuan at the Mongolian-Tibetan School started to reduce their meals for a week starting on the 15th. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The society in Suiyuan is as stable as ever. All sectors of society are launching fundraising campaigns to buy leather clothing for the front-line soldiers and are forming rescue teams. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nankai Students Visit Fu Zuoyi to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>(Guihua) Five Nankai University students came to Sui on the 14th to inspect the actual situation in Sui East and visited Fu Zuoyi to pay respects to the front-line soldiers. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Five Nankai students went to Pingdiquan on the evening of the 15th to inspect. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Princess Shi Defends Territory</h3>
<p>(Baotou News) There is a heroine in Suiyuan's border region who leads Mongolian troops to defend the frontier. This person is Ms. Qi Jinfen, Princess Shi. The princess is 23 years old.

The princess graduated from middle school and has a solid foundation in both Chinese and Mongolian languages. During Prince Shi's lifetime, she assisted him in political affairs, and many of his political plans came from her excellent advice and grand strategies.

<h3>From Shanhaiguan to Shenyang</h3>
<p>— Qi Guang</p>
<p>Quietly recalling past events is like a terrifying nightmare!</p>
<p>The world is so treacherous – bizarre nightmares can befall even ordinary people like us; it's no wonder that those extraordinary individuals desperately seek to transform this perilous world!</p>
<p>After several incidents, my hometown held no more reason to linger. Thus, we decided to embark on a long journey! The significance of this journey: not to evade danger and seek safety, nor to willingly succumb to depravity, but simply because the environment has become tiresome to me, and I to it. A temporary change; I will continue to strive and hone myself, yearning for a bright future where I can fulfill my due responsibilities!</p>
<p>Our economic means were limited, so we purchased "hard third-class" tickets (note: the direct express train from Siberia to Europe has two types of third-class: soft and hard, with a one-fold difference in fare). We would traverse our invaded homeland, embarking on our arduous, adventure-like journey!</p>
<p>The special direct express train to Shenyang passed Shanhaiguan in the morning. There were few Chinese passengers in our carriage; two or three were members of an Oxford group on their way to visit Japan. The majority of the group members were British or American, with perhaps one or two Japanese. In addition, there was a short, stout Chinese man, fluent in Japanese, claiming to be visiting friends in Changchun, or perhaps rushing to Changchun, the capital of the puppet state of Manchukuo, to become a puppet official! The remaining passengers were us and two other young people seeking advancement in Europe.</p>
<p>When the train reached Shanhaiguan, Japanese individuals acting as puppet state tax officials and police swarmed aboard, ordering all Westerners to the dining car to sign puppet state entry permits. Only a handful of Chinese remained in the entire carriage, at their mercy. Police and military police, like wolves and tigers, questioned passports one after another, scrutinizing every detail of each Chinese individual. The tax officials seemed to be deliberately causing trouble, demanding that all trunks be completely opened, while they themselves wandered off elsewhere to harass other Chinese passengers! Order descended into chaos, and the passengers grew anxious. The Japanese tax officials and military police moved back and forth, scolding harshly at the slightest dissatisfaction. We waited for a while, but the tax official did not return to inspect our luggage. We dared not close the trunks, so we went in search of the tax official. The tax official did not speak Chinese, and we communicated in English. Suddenly, we angered two nearby military police officers who forcibly dragged me back to my original place, threatening to punish me severely. However, when they saw my wife standing by my side, they hesitated somewhat. So, they asked me:</p>
<p>"Who is this person to you?"</p>
<p>"My wife."</p>
<p>"Are you Chinese or Western? Westerners go to the dining car!" They grew suspicious!</p>
<p>"Of course, I am Chinese!" I seemed to have a touch of pride.</p>
<p>"And her?"</p>
<p>"She is my wife, naturally also Chinese!" So, we showed them our Chinese passports and her citizenship certificate.</p>
<p>After examining them, they discussed it briefly amongst themselves, then left without a word!</p>
<p>The train started moving. A Japanese woman and a frail old woman from the puppet state, accompanied by her son in his thirties, entered the carriage. The tax official still had not returned, and our trunks remained open on the floor, daring not close them! Perhaps they were obstructing the Japanese woman, who gestured for us to close them. We did as she asked, assuming that the tax official would not return! As soon as the trunks were closed and returned to their original positions, the tax official in white robes stood menacingly before me, demanding that I reopen all the trunks. I tried to explain, but he paid no heed. I had no choice but to swallow my anger and reopen them all. By this point, I was very hungry, my arms were exhausted, and I was filled with anger. In a moment of carelessness, a heavy leather trunk slipped and fell on me, then dropped to the ground. My left shoulder suffered a minor injury, and a corner of the trunk was broken. The tax official laughed uproariously, as if he had exhausted his ability to bully me! I glared at him, allowing him to inspect everything. He rummaged through the trunks, making a mess, but found nothing contraband!</p>
<p>After the luggage ordeal, my wife touched my left shoulder to comfort me, repeatedly telling me to "be patient" and urging me to go to the dining car to eat something.</p>
<p>In the dining car, although I ordered breakfast, I could not swallow a bite! My eyes widened, incessantly gazing at the small mountains, lush forests, and verdant fields speeding past the window. Looking again at the roguish figures moving back and forth in the carriage and seated at the dining tables, I felt a pang of national humiliation rise in my heart!</p>
<p>"Ah! This..." I began to speak, with a mixture of resentment and sorrow, but my wife quickly pressed my hand, telling me to "be patient"!</p>
<p>Returning from the dining car, I saw that the two young men from Peiping going to Europe to study looked very dejected and depressed. I dared not go forward to inquire, as there were too many rogues in the carriage, and we were under severe surveillance everywhere!</p>
<p>The short, stout gentleman going to the puppet state to become a puppet official spoke with the Japanese military police for a while in Japanese. Naturally, everything was in order for him, and he gazed triumphantly out the window at the territory under the rule of his new masters!</p>
<p>One of the members of the tour group, who looked very familiar, perhaps an old classmate, approached me with concern. How could I dare say anything? I could only reply, "Everything is resolved." We stood in the corridor by the window, reminiscing about the past. My friend suddenly remarked:</p>
<p>"The scenery here is quite good; this year's harvest will surely be plentiful!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Such beautiful land...!" My words were left unfinished, and I dared not complete them. We looked at each other, and both remained silent. We spoke of other trivial matters, then each returned to our seats!</p>
<p>The Japanese woman in the carriage was a reporter, and the sallow, emaciated young man from the puppet state was the editor of a newspaper in Jinzhou. Engaging with them briefly, I could not contain the resentment in my heart, and I was too lazy to chat idly with them, so I feigned sleep to escape the situation.</p>
<p>Along the way, the majority of the passengers were Japanese, with very few people from the puppet state. Perhaps travel is extremely difficult. Regardless of whether they were people from the puppet state or Japanese, they had to present something similar to a passport to the ticket inspector when their tickets were checked. The Japanese control over the puppet state is so thorough that it is terrifying! But at the same time, it also reveals the rulers' apprehension and fear. And who knows if it is not a reflection of the struggles of righteous armies everywhere?</p>
<p>Before the train reached Shenyang, we had considered not stopping in Shenyang, and leaving the puppet state as quickly as possible. On the other hand, we also wanted to "sightsee" in Shenyang, to see what the invaders' rule was really like!</p>
<p>Ah! Tens of thousands of brave men from beyond the passes are braving gunfire, scattered in various places fighting the enemy in a final struggle. What could possibly frighten "wealthy young masters" like us, who only need to "learn from the Jin people" and remain silent, as we go there to take a look? So, we finally decided: no matter what, we would stop in Shenyang for a day!</p>
<p>Before leaving the country, we had heard from a foreign friend who had recently visited Shenyang that it was best to stay at a certain small German inn. Coincidentally, when the train arrived in Shenyang, the inn's employee was standing in front of our train window to pick up guests, so we checked into the inn without any trouble. At the station, a large contingent of Japanese soldiers was holding a memorial service. The area around the station was filled with Japanese and Korean rogues. Japanese shops, banks... connected to the station, occupying a large area! Being there was like traveling in Japan, except that the Japanese soldiers were bustling about in groups, and the rogues were more savage, something rarely seen even in Japan itself!</p>
<p>The small German inn was located in a corner of a remote street, and its facilities were quite refined. It was far from the bustling city center, free from "inspection" disturbances, and very comfortable!</p>
<p>We went for a walk on the streets in the evening. The city was unusually desolate. A large botanical garden – Wanyi Garden – was frighteningly dark. The people of the puppet state walking on the streets all wore the faces of opium addicts. Walking through the narrow alleys, the smell of opium smoke wafted from both sides, making one feel faint! Near the station, the streets were filled with Japanese prostitutes, doing their utmost to entice customers! Then, I suddenly recalled what I had seen in Saigon five years ago on my way to Europe by sea! The strategies for ruling colonies are probably all the same old tricks!</p>

<h3>Telegram</h3>
<p>To the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, after reviewing the reports of various newspapers regarding the accident of a special express train of our railway on the 14th at Xiaoyi Station, resulting in many deaths and injuries, we have verified that it is an inaccurate rumor. On that day, the special express train No. 1 was safe and sound and there was no accident. However, a westbound freight train at the station had a mishandled shunting operation, resulting in a collision with a single locomotive, damaging one boxcar and resulting in several deaths and injuries. As a result, the track was blocked, and the special express train No. 1 was stopped at another station to wait, with a delay of about two hours. This telegram is sent specifically to you, and we hope that it will be published promptly. Railway Bureau of Longhai Railway.</p>
<h3>Japanese New Five-Year Gold Mining Plan in the Northeast; Installation of Gold Dredges and Allocation of Mining Areas Aims to Greatly Increase Production and Obtain Substantial Profits</h3>
<p>(Changchun News) The Manchurian Gold Mining Company, established by the Japanese, has a new mining plan to utilize modern scientific gold mining methods. The first step was the construction of a gold dredge on the Niqiu River, located more than 180 li southwest of Heihe in the Xing'an Mountains. The dredge was completed at the end of October and has now begun operating. It is reported that the company aims to mine 70 million yuan worth of placer gold over five years using the gold dredge. Its mining capacity is 120,000 cubic yards per month (each cubic yard contains placer gold worth one yuan at current prices). Even after removing the six months of winter when operations are not possible, it can mine up to 7.2 million yuan worth of placer gold. The Japanese believe that this marks a major revolution in the historically passive gold mining industry of "Manchuria" and that there are great prospects. Furthermore, the company has discovered extremely rich gold veins in the Niqiu River area after trial digging, and will add another gold dredge to the river next year. Currently, the Japanese are implementing the five-year gold mining plan in order to achieve the goal of obtaining substantial profits.</p>

<h3>15th Anniversary of the China International Famine Relief Commission</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission (CIFRC) has now existed for fifteen years. The commission is the successor to the International Famine Relief Fund. It was established on November 16, 1921. Over the years, it has achieved remarkable results in disaster relief work in various provinces of China, which are deeply appreciated and unforgettable by the Chinese people. After 1921, China's disasters never ceased. The larger ones initially included the drought in the five provinces of North China, followed by the floods in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the drought in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, and the floods and droughts in Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. In 1931, an unprecedented major flood almost covered the entire China. In 1932, there were also the floods in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hubei, and Shanxi, and the droughts and typhoons in Jiangxi and Shaanxi. In 1933, various kinds of disasters spread throughout China again. Provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, and Guizhou had floods. Provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Fujian, and Guizhou had typhoons. Provinces such as Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Guizhou had hailstorms. Provinces such as Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guizhou had wind disasters. Provinces such as Hebei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had insect plagues. In 1934, floods spread in provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Droughts spread in provinces such as Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. After the spring famine in 1935, there was another major flood that swept the country. Although the disaster area was not as extensive as in 1931, the severity of the disaster was no less than in 1931. Although the country is claiming a bumper harvest this year, provinces such as Sichuan are still suffering from drought.</p>
<p>Each time a disaster struck, hundreds of thousands of people were affected, and property losses amounted to millions or hundreds of millions. Various charitable organizations did their best to provide relief in order to alleviate the suffering of the victims. However, most could only provide relief after the disaster, and could not prevent it beforehand. Apart from providing relief, at most they would only engage in protection and emergency repairs during floods. Only the China International Famine Relief Commission (CIFRC) was able to have a far-sighted vision, not only providing relief, but also constructing water conservancy projects to prevent floods and droughts, and initiating rural cooperation to revitalize the rural economy. The Commission not only did many charitable relief projects, but also did many constructive social projects.</p>
<p>The latter type of project is most worthy of our praise. We know that there are only two reasons why China is so prone to disasters. First, the economic power of the great powers has penetrated the interior, and the rural areas are increasingly collapsing. Farmers cannot even afford enough food and clothing, and of course they have no resources to improve farming techniques. Second, past Chinese authorities have also been too neglectful of water conservancy construction. The China International Famine Relief Commission (CIFRC), based on its experience in disaster relief, deeply understands these two fundamental causes of disasters in China. Disasters cannot be effectively relieved if these fundamental causes are not addressed. Therefore, although the name of the commission is famine relief, its work is not limited to this. In addition to providing famine relief, the Commission also uses work-for-relief programs to dig canals and build dikes to prevent floods and droughts in the north. It also builds roads to facilitate the flow of agricultural products, and establishes rural cooperatives to relieve the economic hardship of farmers. These projects are difficult and heavy. Fortunately, thanks to the painstaking efforts of the Commission's enthusiastic Chinese and foreign personnel, such remarkable achievements have been made today. We can say that the Commission has built a good foundation for the work of revitalizing the rural economy in China. Now, on the occasion of the Commission's 15th anniversary, in addition to praising the Commission's past achievements, we hope that the Commission will continue to work hard to bring endless benefits to the people of China.</p>
<h3>The Seiyukai Party's Diplomatic Policy Advocates Cooperation Between China, Japan and "Manchukuo"</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Seiyukai Party's North Shinano Conference held in Toyama City on the 15th, President Suzuki (reading on behalf of another) strongly advocated breaking the bad habit of bureaucratic omnipotence, supporting parliamentary politics and encouraging party members. Next, a declaration resolution was passed. The following are the diplomatic policy points in the declaration:</p>
<p>In accordance with the current international situation, it is necessary to establish a diplomatic policy as the center of national policy. All new policies should be based on this, and the overall structure should be formed accordingly. Japan's diplomacy should aim to maintain harmony with allied countries in order to achieve world peace, and should particularly take on the rise and fall of the entire East Asian situation. To enable one billion people to live in a peaceful cultural paradise is a major goal. Therefore, attention should be paid to friendly cooperation between China, Japan and "Manchukuo". However, the recent lack of adjustment in Sino-Japanese relations is truly regrettable. The government should continue to use Japan's fair policy to individually resolve complex matters, and the fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese diplomacy should not be delayed.

<h3>Germany Unilaterally Abrogates Navigation Treaties: Causing Repercussions in Various Countries; Berlin's Move is Purely a Political Demonstration; Prior Consent Sought from Germany, Austria, and Hungary; Relevant Countries Prepare Collective Protest</h3>
<p>(London) It is learned here today that, before announcing the abrogation of the German river freedom of navigation treaties, German leader Hitler first obtained the consent of Germany, Austria, and Hungary. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the German note abrogating the international navigation system was delivered to the French Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Delbos was in his constituency of Périgueux. Therefore, the Director of Political Affairs, Weiyeno, and Prime Minister Blum discussed countermeasures. Subsequently, the Foreign Ministry instructed the French ambassadors stationed in the relevant countries to discuss with the respective host governments the situation created by Germany's move. The Foreign Ministry now believes that these countries will soon lodge a collective protest with the German government. Furthermore, those involved believe that this move by Germany is purely a political demonstration. If the German government were to adopt normal diplomatic channels, it would not be able to satisfy the people at home. Therefore, it must resort to surprising actions. This has been the case in the past, and it remains so now. Moreover, Germany's move has already affected most European countries, with the United Kingdom being particularly affected by the navigation systems of the Rhine and the Kiel Canal. According to reports, when Poland and the Soviet Union were at war in 1920, the British transport ship "Wimbledon" loaded with munitions attempted to pass through the German Kiel Canal to Poland. At that time, the German government prohibited the ship from passing through the canal. However, the Treaty of Versailles explicitly stipulated that warships and merchant ships of all countries could freely pass through the Kiel Canal. Therefore, the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan jointly filed a lawsuit with the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. As a result, Germany ultimately lost the case. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The German government today notified 14 governments, announcing the abrogation of the clauses on international free navigation of German waterways contained in the Treaty of Versailles. This note was only delivered to the French Foreign Ministry at 4:00 PM today. Therefore, it is currently unknown what attitude the French government will adopt towards this move. However, it is generally expected that France will decide on its position in a short period of time. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the Rhine River is also open to free navigation by ships of all countries, and a Central Commission for Rhine Navigation was established to manage it. The Commission held a meeting in Strasbourg, France, a few days ago, which has not yet concluded. However, this morning, the German representative suddenly announced that he had been summoned back to Germany and suspended his attendance. At the same time, the French Embassy in Berlin also received verbal notification from the German government, stating that the German government was now withdrawing from all international river commissions and announced that the provisional Rhine navigation measures agreed upon by France and Germany on May 4 of this year were also being abrogated. These provisional measures stipulated changes to the original system of Rhine navigation and were signed several months ago after direct negotiations between France and Germany at the request of the German government. At the time of signing the provisional measures, the German government expressed great satisfaction, but now it is also announcing their abrogation. This kind of about-face is incomprehensible to political circles here. Moreover, Germany's announcement of the abrogation of the international navigation system involves all waterways within Germany, affecting most countries, including some countries that remained neutral during the Great War. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>France Considers Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Ministry recently issued a communiqué stating that, regarding the international navigation of the Rhine River, the German government had previously initiated and France and Germany held negotiations and signed an agreement (referring to the provisional Rhine navigation measures signed on May 4 of this year) to establish a new system to replace the navigation system stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. This agreement is currently being discussed and supplemented by the Central Commission for Rhine Navigation at a meeting in Strasbourg and will soon be finalized. However, at this time, the German government unilaterally announced the abrogation of the clauses on international navigation contained in the Treaty of Versailles. Moreover, in addition to the Rhine River, agreements similar to those on the Rhine had already been established for the navigation of the Elbe River, and negotiations were underway for the navigation of the Oder River. However, the German government has disregarded all of this. Regarding this matter, the French government is now consulting with other relevant countries and has instructed the French delegation attending the Strasbourg conference to declare the abrogation of the provisional Rhine navigation measures signed by France and Germany on May 4 of this year. These provisional measures were originally scheduled to take effect on January 1 of next year and are now considered invalid. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain Quite Disapproving</h3>
<p>(London) After German leader Hitler announced yesterday the abandonment of several clauses in the Treaty of Versailles concerning the internationalization of rivers, the British viewed it with considerable disapproval. They insisted that Germany should follow Turkey's attitude towards the Straits issue and obtain revisions through negotiation. The French Foreign Ministry said that Germany's actions would affect the Rhine and Mannheim treaties. The Mannheim Treaty was only concluded a few months ago, and now it is necessary to renegotiate with the relevant countries. The German note to the countries concerned with its recent actions stated that the ships of all countries friendly to Germany may still sail on German waterways, and that if the countries concerned allow German ships to sail on their domestic waterways, Germany will not discriminate against their ships sailing on German waterways. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Rome Deliberately Plays Deaf and Mute</h3>
<p>(Rome) The clauses contained in the Treaty of Versailles allowing ships of European and American countries to freely navigate certain German waterways were yesterday announced to be abrogated by the German government. The general public here did not comment because they received the news too late. However, well-informed sources said that Italy's attitude towards European issues is aimed at ensuring that all countries enjoy equal rights, and it will certainly view the German government's above-mentioned actions in good faith. (Havas News Agency, 15th)</p>
<h3>Huge Impact on Central European Commerce</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The international community believes that the German government's unilateral announcement of the abrogation of the international navigation system runs counter to the attempt to ease the European situation. It is said that among the countries affected by Germany's decision, the Czech Republic will be the most affected, as the Czech Republic is surrounded by land, and its only access to the sea is the international waterways of the Elbe and Danube rivers, and the two free ports of Hamburg and Stettin in Germany. Now that Germany has announced the abrogation of the international free navigation system of its domestic waterways, the Czech Republic will be blocked and have no access to the sea. International sources also believe that Germany's decision will affect all countries in Central Europe to a small extent, as the Danube River has been an international waterway since the German city of Ulm, passing through Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, and entering the Black Sea. Therefore, it is very important for the shipping and commerce of Central European countries. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Czech Political Circles Greatly Surprised</h3>
<p>Prague, the Czech Capital. The German Minister to the Czech Republic, Essendor, formally notified Foreign Minister Kraufda today of the German government's decision to abrogate the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles concerning international waterways. Related parties here were quite surprised to hear the news, as negotiations regarding the navigation of Czech ships on German inland waterways had been initiated at the request of the German side and had lasted for quite some time. The Czech Republic had made great concessions to Germany in the middle. Now, Germany has unilaterally announced the abrogation of the international navigation clauses, causing the negotiations to break down, which is beyond the expectations of the general public. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Canal Plan Comes to Nothing</h3>
<p>Brussels. After the German government unilaterally announced yesterday the abrogation of the clauses contained in the Treaty of Versailles allowing ships of European and American countries to freely navigate certain German waterways, political figures here believe that Belgium has approximately one thousand ships operating on the Rhine River, with a total tonnage of 800,000 tons. Therefore, this issue is directly related to Belgium. Moreover, Belgium has long planned to dig a canal to connect the Meuse River (within Belgium) with the Rhine River (within Germany). The Treaty of Versailles contains a clause stipulating that the construction of this canal within Germany should be undertaken by Germany. Now that this clause has also been announced to be abrogated, there is no hope of building this section of the canal. These people also said that the Dutch government did not agree to join the provisional Rhine navigation measures signed by France and Germany on May 4 of this year, and Germany is now using the attitude of the Dutch government as an excuse, showing that Germany has not considered the interests of France and Belgium at all. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Hungary Feels Uneasy</h3>
<p>Budapest. After the German government unilaterally announced yesterday the abrogation of the clauses contained in the Treaty of Versailles allowing ships of European and American countries to freely navigate certain German waterways, the general public here is quite uneasy. Political figures say that Germany's move was expected, but Hungary's exports rely on the Danube River as a channel. If Germany implements a new system for shipping there, Hungary's foreign trade will be controlled by the countries downstream of the Danube (i.e., Romania, Yugoslavia, etc.), and these countries are not Hungary's allies. This is what Hungary fears. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>The United States Does Not Intend to Protest</h3>
<p>(Washington) The German announcement of the abrogation of the clauses on free navigation of international waterways contained in the Treaty of Versailles is a violation of the treaty signed between the United States and Germany. Although the United States did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, Article 2 of the treaty of peace between the United States and Germany in the European War states that it guarantees the United States the enjoyment of all the preferences contained in the Treaty of Versailles regarding the river section. Therefore, Germany's abrogation of the clause in the Treaty of Versailles will inevitably affect the United States. However, semi-official sources believe that the US government will not lodge a protest with Berlin. The general diplomatic policy pursued by the United States is to advocate for the official publication of declarations condemning the entire fact of treaty violation, without advocating for protesting each incident. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Romania: Diplomatic Policy: Respect for Treaties; Support for the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Bucharest, the Capital of Romania. Parliament reconvened today, and King Carol personally attended and read the edict, stating that Romania's diplomatic policy is to foster friendly relations and cooperate with all countries within the framework of the League of Nations, strengthen its mutual relations with its allies in order to maintain international peace and guarantee the integrity of its territory. "All actions aimed at enhancing the prestige and power of the League of Nations will be fully supported by the government. Existing alliance treaties should be promoted and enhanced, and close contact should be maintained with the authorities of all allied countries." He then made some explanations on domestic issues, stating that the government is determined to strengthen military preparations in order to consolidate national defense. Finally, he called on the people of the country to unite as one. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>US Naval Aviation Office Suggests Improving Coastal Facilities; Establishing Aviation Base in the Center of the Pacific; No Reason for Commercial Activities to Object</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Naval Aviation Office today released its annual report, suggesting expanding and improving coastal facilities and naval aviation bases in order to accommodate US naval aircraft, because according to the Navy's plan, there will be 1,910 aircraft by 1940. At the same time, the report also suggested immediately building one aircraft of 2.5 million cubic feet and one metal-hulled airship of 1.5 million cubic feet. (National Newspaper, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, according to Army officials, Army engineers suggested building an aviation base on Wake Island at a cost of US$1 million. The original proposal was to build it on Halfway Island, because Wake Island is 1,45 miles from Guam in the east, and Midway is 1,248 miles further east. Well-informed sources also said that suggestions to improve the situation in Guam may be put forward soon. According to Acting Secretary of War Milton, this plan has nothing to do with the Washington Naval Treaty's defense works in the Pacific, but is intended to provide a landing place for aircraft flying in the Pacific to facilitate commercial activities, because in the future, aircraft traveling to and from the Pacific may become increasingly numerous. This development is aimed at providing a safe base for commercial airships, and its scale is very small and insufficient for military use. Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McReynolds, also agreed with Mr. Moore, saying that this move is a statement, and no Asian country can object. Wake Island is currently one of the five stops for Pan American Airlines' Clipper flying boats crossing the Pacific, and it is close to the Caroline Islands in the Pacific, which are administered by Japan. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Observers here say that if the United States establishes seaplane bases on Wake Island and Halfway Island, it will be competing with Japan's construction of harbor projects on the islands it administers in the Pacific. It is recalled that European and American countries have repeatedly expressed that Japan needs to spend huge sums of money on commerce in the islands it administers in order to build these harbor projects, because naval experts generally say that if there is a war in the Far East, these harbors can be the best submarine bases. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan's New Aircraft Carrier: Naming Ceremony Scheduled</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Ministry of the Navy, the water surface aircraft carrier "Chitose," a major force of the Japanese Navy, which was built at the Wu Naval Dockyard on November 29, Showa 9 (1934), will hold a grand naming ceremony at the dockyard on the 29th of this month, with the Chief of the Military Command, Fushimi, attending as a representative. The ship is 18.8 meters wide, has a draft of 5.78 meters, a displacement of 9,000 tons, a horsepower of 15,000 horsepower, a speed of 20 knots, and is also equipped with four anti-aircraft guns and other excellent performance. (Allied Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Civil Aviation: Reforming the Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) For the sake of a landmark leap in civil aviation, the Ministry of Communications is promoting a plan for an aviation external bureau to reform the aviation administrative structure. The Army authorities are also proposing a plan for a Ministry of Aviation, etc. Whether to adopt it is currently under consideration by the four-ministry meeting. The Ministry of Communications has requested the Ministry of Finance to set up an external bureau as part of the next year's budget, which has now been largely approved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the reform of aviation administration, the expenditure will be increased by 469,000 yen; (1) The new construction fee for the Aviation Bureau office building will be 258,000 yen; (1) The survey fee for aviation line operations will be 69,000 yen. Therefore, Japanese civil aviation administration is expected to see a landmark leap from next year. (Allied Telegram, 15th)</p>

<h3>Little Change in the Battle Situation Near Madrid, Spain; Rebel Planes Drop Giant Bombs in Prosperous Areas; More Than Two Hundred Residents of the Capital Killed and Wounded</h3>
<p>Madrid. Our correspondent reports that there has been no change in the battle situation near Madrid in the past few hours, but the reinforcements sent by the Autonomous Region of Catalonia in the northeast and the city of Valencia in the southeast have already arrived. They can flank the Nationalist forces in the southwest suburbs, making them suffer from both sides. Therefore, the government forces have entered a new situation in terms of strategy. In addition, Premier Caballero visited the villages of Pozuelos in the southeast yesterday to inspect the military situation, showing that the government forces have cleared the enemy forces in the area leading to Aranjuez and the Getafe airfield in the south. Furthermore, according to the communiqué issued by the government forces, the government artillery has been able to control the Angeles Pass (east of the Getafe airfield). In the north of the capital, there are several columns of government forces strictly defending it, and there is no chance of error. The Nationalist forces have surrounded the capital and have no chance of winning. Moreover, since the government aircraft won the battle with the Nationalist aircraft in the skies over Madrid last Friday, the morale of the militia has been boosted. Those who are not fighting on the front lines are also full of energy and are building defenses. Every morning, thousands of old men shoulder baskets and dig trenches, or arrange obstacles, or level mountain slopes and roads to facilitate military transport. The sacks they carry are all handmade by young girls, and thousands of women are assisting them. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) It is learned here today that Reuters' special correspondent stationed in the Nationalist forces reports that the Nationalist troops have crossed the Manzanares River between the Toledo and Princes bridges. Even if the above is confirmed, the Nationalist forces may find it difficult to defend the positions they have gained. The situation in Madrid is extremely tragic after yesterday's air raid by Nationalist bombers. Yesterday, the Nationalist forces sent three large aircraft to drop a total of 25 huge bombs in the center of the city during the busiest time. No fewer than fifty or sixty people were killed on the spot, most of whom were women and children. More than two hundred people were injured. Many public buildings, hotels, stations, and other houses were bombed into rubble. The purpose of the Nationalist air raid was clearly the building where the public works department was located, because there were anti-aircraft guns on the roof. Many dead and wounded women and children were lying on the sidewalks in the square near there. The main water pipe buried in the street has been blown up, causing the area to become a swamp. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid. It is reported that the government forces have launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the Nationalist forces on the eastern and southeastern fronts of the capital. The line of government troops in these two places now extends from Ciempozuelos, twenty miles south of Madrid, through Ciempozuelos, to Aranjuez. The government forces also began to attack the Toledo area south of the capital. At the same time, General Ankonban Anda has come to Madrid from Barcelona to command the government forces on the northern front. In the recent Nationalist air raid on the capital, sixty people were killed and two hundred people were injured, all of whom were civilians. As a result of the air raid, the North Station was also slightly damaged. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Both Sides Claim Victory in War Reports</h3>
<p>The Rebels Admit Slow Progress, Not Measured in Miles but in Yards</p>
<p>Madrid. The Defense Committee recently issued a communiqué stating that the rebel army launched fierce attacks on the southwest and west of Madrid, but were repelled by the government forces at the end of the French Bridge. The government's defense is solid and does not shake slightly. In the south-west of Madrid, the government army has advanced forward and has already occupied several highlands, enough to control the positions of the rebels at the Angeles Pass. In short, "all destinations designated by the Government Army Headquarters have been reached one after another." In addition, the General Headquarters issued a notice stating that government air force officers who use parachutes in air combat to escape must be arrested and sent to the General Headquarters to await disposal. In addition, all ordnance manufacturers in Madrid City must report to the military authorities to await dispatch. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Seville. According to the radio station here today, the Nationalist front line around Madrid has advanced and is more consolidated than before. In the recent attack, 300 enemies were captured. General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, has 40,000 Nationalist soldiers fighting on the front lines in Madrid. (Reuters Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Lisbon. According to Nationalist sources, Nationalist planes spent the whole day yesterday bombing military hazardous locations in Madrid. The government army attacked in the Gasatel-Campo area at dawn and was repelled by the Nationalist army with heavy casualties. After a long consultation with General Falila's headquarters today, Nationalist officers informed the press that, "We used to progress by miles every day, but now we only progress by yards."

<h3>Rebel Strategy: Not Seeking Hasty Progress; Preparing for Long-Term Defense; Food Shortages in the Besieged City Are Worrisome</h3>
<p>Avila City (90 kilometers northwest of Madrid). Our correspondent reports that after the militia belonging to the government army decided to defend Madrid to the death, everyone here asks with great concern, "Will General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, destroy this city, or will he besiege it for a long time to wait for the government army to abandon it on its own?" As of now, although Nationalist aircraft and artillery have frequently bombarded the city, they are limited to military targets. They pay attention to the military strategic locations in the southern part of the city. Sometimes they also bomb the central area of the city, but they have always been cautious about the location of the embassies in the northeast, and have never allowed it to be affected. It can be seen from this that General Franco has no intention of destroying the entire city. As for the government army, if the Nationalist army enters the city immediately at this time, it will inevitably be hidden in the houses, so that it can shoot from the windows and inflict heavy damage. This is also the reason why the Nationalist army is unwilling to make hasty progress. Based on this, the Nationalist army's long-term siege is very likely. Moreover, in fact, the Nationalist army does not need to completely encircle the entire city. There are seven highways leading from Madrid to other provinces. Three of them have been occupied by the Nationalist army, and two of them are under Nationalist artillery fire. The remaining two roads, one leading to the city of Burgos in the northwest, have been cut off by the Nationalist forces in the Soma Mountains north of Madrid, and one leading to the city of Barcelona in the northeast, although still in the hands of the government forces, must pass through small roads within 50 kilometers of Madrid to avoid the Nationalist artillery fire. Since there are not many roads to the outside of the city, the food supply for the more than one million residents of the city is extremely difficult. In particular, the highway to Barcelona, ​​the only one that can be accessed as mentioned above, Nationalist aircraft have continued to drop bombs on it, carrying out bombardments, and there is a danger that food trucks will be bombed from time to time. In addition, with the arrival of severe winter, Madrid is a plateau with a cold climate, which is also very unfavorable for the soldiers defending the city. (Havas Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>The Valencia Front: The Spanish Cabinet Convenes, Optimistic About the War's Future</h3>
<p>Valencia - The cabinet held a meeting yesterday to discuss the military situation near Madrid. Prime Minister Caballero reported on the government's counteroffensive. The cabinet then issued a statement saying, "Prime Minister Caballero, along with Speaker of the House Barrio, Minister of Navy and Aviation Prieto, Minister of Foreign Affairs del Vayo, and the Air Force Commander, discussed the government's counteroffensive near Madrid several days ago in Alarcón. Afterward, the Prime Minister, accompanied by the Foreign Minister, inspected the front lines for three days and met with General Miaja, Chairman of the Defense Committee. On Friday of last week, government forces began their counteroffensive against the Nationalist positions southwest of the city, as planned. The Prime Minister and his entourage continued to tour the front lines that day, closely monitoring the military operations until formal contact was made, before returning to Valencia. However, Minister of Justice Oliver and Minister of Commerce López (both anarchists) remained in Madrid and have not yet returned," (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid - The local radio station recently broadcast a message stating that the Defense Committee held a meeting to discuss the military situation and unanimously agreed that government forces had gained the upper hand. Twenty-five truckloads of food have arrived in the city from Castellón in the southeast, ensuring there will be no shortage. Furthermore, judging from reports in various newspapers, the public is also optimistic about the war situation. "Noticias" stated, "The war situation is extremely favorable to our forces. The rebel attempt to take Madrid has failed, which the rebels must admit." Moreover, in the Casa Velázquez area in western Madrid, where French students at the French University reside, the students, fearing that Nationalist aircraft would mistakenly bomb their buildings, hung French flags on the roofs of each building to identify them. However, Nationalist aircraft indiscriminately bombed the area anyway. Photographs of the bombing were taken and published by "Noticias" as proof. Furthermore, newspapers affiliated with the anarchist CNT, such as "Madrid Libre," also criticized the rebel aircraft's bombing of the capital, calling it "harming the innocent" and advising the public to remain calm.

<h3>Alcohol Extracted from Street Dust</h3>
<p>Japanese Researchers Succeed</p>
<p>Osaka - Research on producing alcohol from street dust in urban areas has been successfully completed by Dr. Shizu Nakamura, a Doctor of Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at Osaka Imperial University, and is about to be industrialized. The method involves using acids on plant matter such as paper, wood, and bamboo in the dust, breaking them down under high pressure to saccharify and ferment them, thus producing alcohol. The so-called Asura method of high-pressure decomposition with dilute acid is used. According to the doctor's research, 300,000 koku (石, a traditional unit of volume) of alcohol can be produced annually from the dust of cities across the country, including 50,000 koku from Osaka alone. Compared to the current national alcohol production of 20,000 koku, this seems like a wild fantasy. The cost of synthetic alcohol using starch as a raw material is 6 yen per gallon, but if dust is used as the raw material, the cost would be only 4 to 4.5 yen. If this is industrialized, the national policy of alcohol fuel could be established as a result. Therefore, the doctor's research is highly anticipated in various fields.

<h3>US to Control Foreign Investment, London Market Panics</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently told reporters that foreign investment in the US market in currency exchange transactions of various countries has huge hidden benefits, and the US government may pass laws to control foreign purchases of Hengwei. Today, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission replied that the powers currently held by securities market management organizations cannot restrict foreigners from buying and selling US securities. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) After President Roosevelt issued a warning regarding foreigners using large sums of money to purchase American securities, government officials here today believe that the British Treasury Department will discuss the matter with the United States. However, it is understood that the meeting will only discuss the impact of Roosevelt's warning. Financial experts believe that there are three types of foreigners purchasing American securities: first, French investors who are eager to export capital due to political reasons; second, American investors who are purchasing abroad to avoid taxes; and third, speculators in the London and international markets who believe that American industry will soon boom. As a result, London securities brokers have recently been dealing more in American securities than in domestic securities. Yesterday, the market panicked when it heard President Roosevelt's statement. British financial leaders are eager for the United States to initiate measures to correct this phenomenon of international investment, fearing that British intervention may damage London's position as an international financial center.

<h3>British Commerce Gradually Recovering, Both Imports and Exports Increase</h3>
<p>(London) The British Board of Trade released British trade statistics for October today, showing that Britain's recovery and prosperity is increasing. Exports in October totaled £41,000,000, the highest record since November 1933, an increase of £6,000,000 compared to September. Imports totaled £80,500,000, an increase of £9,000,000 compared to September. Judging from the released trade statistics, the sales of British-made locomotives, airplanes, and ships, etc., have increased in foreign markets. The total value of British exports in the ten months of 1936 increased by ten million pounds compared to last year, while imports increased by seventy-five million pounds compared to last year, because the business of British manufacturers has increased and they have had to import large quantities of raw materials to cope with demand. In addition, another reason is that prices around the world are trending upwards. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>The Seventeenth Session of the League of Nations General Assembly (Cont. 4)</h3>
<p>1.  The Question of the Credentials of the Abyssinian Representative... Work of the Chinese Representative in Various Committees: (A) First Committee (B) Second Committee (C) Third Committee (D) Fourth Committee (E) Fifth Committee (F) Sixth Committee... 3. The Question of the Reorganization of the League of Nations Covenant... 4. Speech by the Chinese Representative in the General Discussion... 5. China's Election as Member of the Administrative Council and Judge of the Hague Court... 6. Conclusion...</p>
<p>Under the current eventful international circumstances, while improving the organization of the League of Nations or implementing the principles of the Covenant is important and necessary, it cannot serve as the most effective means of maintaining international peace and promoting international understanding. I have previously stated that the recent situation has been increasingly aggravated by the aggression of a few countries and the competition of various countries in armaments. There is mutual suspicion among countries, and faith in the concepts of law and justice is gradually disappearing. Even peace-loving countries are forced to rearm under duress. Thus, military force has once again risen to prominence. Both large and small countries are making significant sacrifices, resulting in an increased burden on taxpayers and reduced daily necessities to meet the heavy demands of armaments. This situation must be stopped, otherwise, the outbreak of events cannot be avoided. Therefore, I ask you whether the issue of disarmament can be reintroduced and whether the Disarmament Conference can be reopened and revived from the lowest conditions. What should be noted at the same time as the issue of disarmament is the issue of economic recovery. Perhaps it can be said that rearmament is the only way to achieve economic recovery. Generally speaking, the purpose of rearmament is mostly to obtain markets and new raw material supplies to enrich the economy. This kind of economic nationalism, prevalent in the current international arena, not only hinders commerce but also obstructs economic recovery. Further, it can cause international unrest, especially between rich and poor countries. This kind of economic oppression has always been the center of domestic unrest and international disputes. Therefore, I would like to ask you again whether it is possible to find a way for countries to approach frank and friendly attitudes, discuss these economic issues, and cooperate to explore solutions. I firmly believe that the questions I have asked are all extremely important, and I myself cannot lightly dismiss them. At least I can say that my country is always willing to do its part in the peaceful movement aimed at extinguishing war and ensuring collective security. My country's current situation is indeed difficult, and its strength is indeed weak, but its admiration for peace is very ardent, and it sincerely promotes its realization in promoting peace.</p>
<h3>(V) Record of China's Election as Member of the Administrative Council and Judge of the Hague Court</h3>
<p>The report of the Committee on the Reorganization of the Administrative Council and its examination in the First Committee have been described above. The General Assembly of the League of Nations held its 15th plenary meeting at 6:00 PM on October 8th to elect judges of the Hague Court and the two newly established seats of the Chairman of the Administrative Council. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the Credentials Committee was immediately asked to meet to examine the nomination papers and resumes of judges submitted by various countries, in order to begin the election of three judges of the Hague Court. However, in order to save time, the election of the Chairman of the Administrative Council was conducted simultaneously before the committee completed its examination, because it was announced that according to the resolution passed by China on October 2nd requesting to stand for election to the Administrative Council General Assembly, the first step should be to hold a preliminary vote, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the resolution passed on September 15, 1926 (Reporter's note: According to the aforementioned two articles, a non-permanent member of the Administrative Council cannot restore the right to be elected after the expiration of its term of office unless three years have passed. If the three-year period has not expired and they wish to be elected, they must obtain two-thirds of the total votes to obtain the preliminary election qualification. My country's seat expired in 1934, and the three-year period had not expired, so this procedure had to be followed) and French representative Boncour and Soviet representative Litvinov were invited to be vote counters, and a secret ballot was used to start voting. The results were as follows:</p>
<p>There were 52 votes in total, with 2 invalid votes, and 50 valid votes. Two-thirds of the majority was 34 votes. China received 48 votes in favor and 2 votes against. The Chairman then announced that China had obtained the preliminary election qualification. According to general speculation, the main countries that cast negative votes were Turkey and Belgium. Turkey used this to vent its anger because it was competing with us for a judge of the Hague Court. Belgium's attitude of not voting for us had been expressed in the First Committee, which can be proven. Before the election, when our delegation hosted a banquet for representatives of various countries, each country either attended in person by its chief representative or was replaced by a decisive representative. Only the Turkish delegation declined the invitation, the reason for which can be clearly seen. After China obtained the preliminary election qualification, the General Assembly proceeded to elect two seats on the Council in accordance with the above-mentioned 1926 resolution. The election method was still a secret ballot, and the Chairman invited representatives from Bolivia and New Zealand to be vote counters. The results of the ballot counting were as follows: There were 52 votes in total, 52 valid votes, and the absolute number of votes required was 27. China received 51 votes and Latvia (Lalvia) received 49 votes. Both countries were immediately elected as non-permanent members of the three-year term. From the time of their election, they could immediately take their seats on the Administrative Council. The General Assembly unanimously applauded, expressing congratulations, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Because my country was able to immediately take its seat on the Administrative Council, it immediately added one vote to the Administrative Council during the election of judges, and at the same time, there was an opportunity for temporary activities, so my two elections were actually related. Recalling when my country lost the election two years ago, a certain scholar in China made quite sarcastic remarks about Guo Yi's success or failure, but unexpectedly, Guo's efforts over the past two years have achieved success. Or perhaps Guo failed because he was a Minister at the time, but now that he has been promoted to Ambassador, he has succeeded? The reporter cannot help but feel something. After the Council election was completed, the work of the Credentials Committee was also completed, and the election of judges of the Hague Court also began. According to the procedures for the election of judges, the General Assembly and the Administrative Council voted at the same time. If the candidates received a majority of votes in both parties, they would be elected. If there were different results, both the General Assembly and the Administrative Council would have to hold another vote. The method was still a secret ballot. Before the General Assembly convened, Japan and Brazil had requested to participate in the judge election, so the General Assembly approved the temporary participation of Japan and Brazil in the voting of the General Assembly and the Administrative Council, because it had been reviewed and agreed by the First Committee. When the case was reviewed by the First Committee, our representative also strongly agreed, because when the Japanese judge of the Hague Court, Mr. Nagaoka, was elected last year, it was heard that there had been a promise of exchange conditions for me. Our representative hoped to get one more vote, but the result seemed to be the opposite. It is difficult for us to determine what the actual situation was. The first judge election was to fill the vacancies of German Mr. Schücking and American Mr. Kellogg. The result of the General Assembly vote was that American Manley O. Hudson received 48 out of 54 votes, and Swiss Ake Hammarskjöld received 38 votes. Both received a majority and were the highest vote-getters. At the same time, according to the report of the Administrative Council, the results of the vote also showed that both received a majority. Thus, both were elected. In the second vote to fill the vacancy of Dr. Wang Chonghui, the results of the General Assembly vote were that there were 53 votes in total, 53 valid votes, and the legal majority was 27. Our Dr. Zheng Tianxi received 31 votes, which was more than half. Turkish Mr. Ertekin received only 18 votes, which was less than the legal majority. However, at the same time, the result of the Administrative Council vote was that Mr. Ertekin's votes were more. Thus, the General Assembly had to announce that both parties would hold another election. At that time, our representative attending the Administrative Council was representative Guo, who was able to contact them temporarily, and the help of the British representative was quite effective. Success or failure depended entirely on the last few minutes, and the gain or loss of one vote was enough to sway the situation. Therefore, the result of the Administrative Council's re-election was that out of 16 votes (plus Japan and Brazil), I got 8 votes, Turkey got 7 votes, and one vote was blank. Therefore, my side got more than half of the votes. This one invalid vote can be said to be the center of success or failure. According to reports, our eight votes were from the United Kingdom, Brazil, New Zealand, Chile, Latvia, Spain, Bolivia, and my country. It has been said that the invalid vote was cast by the Soviet Union, or by France, because the Soviet Union and France had initially indicated to me that their votes had already been promised to Turkey. Later, when I communicated with them, their tone was quite ambiguous, or they cast an invalid vote, indicating their neutrality, or perhaps they gave way because of the result of the first vote of the General Assembly, which is unknown. The results of the General Assembly's re-election were that there were 51 votes in total, 1 invalid vote, 50 valid votes, and the legal majority was 26. I got 30 votes and Turkey got 17. The results of both parties were that our Dr. Zheng Tianxi was elected to fill the vacancy of Dr. Wang Chonghui. After the election, representatives from various countries and our news reporters flocked to my country to express their congratulations. At that time, the Turkish reporter had a drink before the judge election, otherwise the opposite would happen. At that time, they were holding pens and waiting quietly for news, but when the results were announced, the reporter's colleagues had disappeared, which can be said to be interesting! (According to the alphabetical order of the chairmanship of the Administrative Council in Latin, at the January meeting next year, the 95th Administrative Council will be chaired by my country.)</p>
<h3>(6) Conclusion</h3>
<p>The 17th General Assembly closed on the 11th of this month. Having described the situation as above, when I close my eyes and reflect, I have many thoughts that I wish to share with the readers. I feel that this time, our dual re-election is indeed the result of diplomatic efforts. However, its main relationship lies in the country itself. Tracing back more than twenty years, in the diplomatic arena, foreigners, whether well-intentioned or malicious, friendly or hostile, have always used the lack of a unified government as an exhortation or an attack against us. Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has already been lost, and the Southwest still exists in secession. In 1934, our country's council member was not elected, which triggered the most profound reflection of our people. Although the election or non-election of council members and judges is not enough to sway the rise and fall of a country, its success or failure is directly proportional to the rise and fall of our country's international status. Since several months ago, the peaceful resolution of the Guangdong and Guangxi problems has established the fact of a centralized government unified to the outside world, and it is enough to lead the people of the whole country towards a unified goal internally. The various constructions in recent years have also shown rapid progress, and the attitudes and concepts of foreigners towards us have also greatly improved. This fact is the greatest reason for promoting our international status, so various problems in diplomacy are also easier to carry out than before. Only in this way should we encourage the heart to move upwards, because our greatest difficulty is becoming more and more pressing. The lesson of Abyssinia is always before us. The attitude of this conference towards Abyssinia can be a warning for us in the future. In addition, I feel that I cannot help but say something about our delegation. I would like to present a few points as humble opinions. Indeed, this year, our delegation has had considerable performance in both work and its own administration. In terms of work, in the various committees of the conference, our representatives attended in person, except for their time for external liaison, so they dealt with various issues very practically and appropriately, which is satisfactory and admirable. In terms of its own administration, there have been more reforms than before. The number of staff members has been reduced compared to last year, and the travel allowances for staff members have also been halved compared to last year. The chief and deputy representatives both held positions in two committees. In general, the results cannot be said to be without significant progress. However, we must not be satisfied with this. We hope to take a further step on a hundred-foot pole, so that next year's conference will be more thorough than this year's. Recalling last year's conference, our delegation had as many as twenty-six people. When examining those who had actual work, it was perhaps less than two-thirds. Because there was no appropriate work to do, they inevitably wasted time in private entertainment. Think about it, coming from afar, both laboring back and forth and wasting expenses, what benefit does it bring to the country? The past is over, and we do not need to pursue it closely. Fortunately, the situation this year is different. However, in terms of the number of people, there is still an oversupply. There are still those who come from afar, enjoying the scenery, carefree and unrestrained, as if forgetting the situation of their country and the place where they themselves are. Comparing what is gained and what is lost, it is really not the same. In this autumn of national crisis, financial distress, and people's exhaustion, only by everyone taking responsibility in a down-to-earth manner to save the country and survive can we have hope. Furthermore, I hope that the staff members will strengthen liaison externally and reduce mutual social interaction internally. The past cannot be admonished, but the future can be pursued. These humble opinions are respectfully offered to our delegation. I don't know if they agree. Time flies, and the conference is over in an instant. The delegations have dispersed. On the shores of Lake Geneva, the fallen leaves are rustling. The bustling atmosphere of Wilson Avenue will only have to wait until next year. (The End)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Expedites the Construction of Branch Line Companies, to be Completed in Three Phases Within Three Months, Construction Funds Also Newly Increased</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In recent years, the construction undertakings in Fujian Province have been devoted to road construction, so the progress of highways has been quite rapid. Now, the authorities believe that the main highway projects have mostly been completed, and it is urgent to build branch line highways in order to complete the province's transportation network. The other day, the Highway General Engineering Office under the Construction Department specially compiled detailed drawings of the branch line highways to be built in various counties, and submitted them to the provincial government for distribution to the county governments, to be built and completed in three phases within three months according to the route set in the drawings, so as to connect with the main highways. If any county has difficulties in terms of funding and engineering, it can report to the provincial government for appropriate subsidies. As for the road construction work of the Construction Department recently, it can be divided into three items: improving the Fujian-Southwest Highway project, realizing the opening of the Fujian-Northwest Highway, and expediting the completion of the transportation routes on the borders of Fujian-Guangdong and Fujian-Zhejiang. Regarding the first item, the Fujian-Southwest Highway starts from Fuzhou, passes through Xinghua, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and ends at Longyan. The entire line has been open to traffic for a long time, but due to military relations in the past, the construction was rushed, and the project was very sloppy. Now, there is a lot of damage, especially the section from Quanzhou to Longyan. Moreover, the important bridges on the entire line have not been erected. Now, the Construction Department and the Highway Office of the National Economic Commission have agreed to borrow Wu Wenhua, an inspector of the Engineering Department of the Highway Office, to serve as the director of the Zhanglongting District Highway Engineering Office, planning to improve the Fujian-Southwest Highway project and build large bridges in various places. Wu will come to Fujian to take office soon. Regarding the second item, the Fujian-Northwest Highway starts from Pucheng, passes through Jian'ou, Yanping, Shaxian, Liancheng, and ends at Longyan. The section from Pucheng to Yanping has been open to traffic for a long time. The section from Yanping to Longyan is supervised and built by Liu Jincheng, the chief engineer of the Highway Engineering Office. A supervision committee is organized in Yong'an County, the center of the section, and personnel are dispatched from the garrison troops of the county government along the line to participate and actively carry out the work. The other day, the Construction Department received a telegram from Chief Engineer Liu, stating that the entire section of the project had been completed on the 2nd, requesting instructions on the date of the opening of the entire line. Since the Pacification Office moved to Jian'ou, this highway will inevitably be more important in terms of transportation. Regarding the third item, the Fujian-Zhejiang Highway starts from Ningde, passes through Xiapu, Fuding, and reaches Pingyang in Zhejiang. The first section was surveyed and completed by a team sent by the Economic Commission to Fujian, but it was suspended due to bandit disturbances. Now, the Economic Commission has decided to send a surveying machine to Fujian again for surveying. The provincial government has ordered the Zhou Zhiqin Brigade stationed in eastern Fujian and the Yi Qiji and Xiong Zhizhong Security Regiments to cooperate in protection in order to plan for construction. There are four Fujian-Guangdong highways. The Wuping-Jiaoling and Zhao'an-Huanggang lines have been completed and opened to traffic immediately. The Pinghe-Raoping line is being expedited by both sides and can be completed within a month. The Construction Department has prepared to open the Yongding-Dapu line, and the estimated total cost of the project is about 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The initial budget for road construction funds in this province in the 25th year was only 250,000 yuan. Later, due to insufficient allocation, it was expanded to 750,000 yuan. Now, the Construction Department believes that the completion of the province's branch line highways requires a large amount of funds, and has requested the provincial government to increase it by 500,000 yuan, which has been approved. Therefore, the total highway funds for the 25th year reached 1.25 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province River and Canal Intermodal Transport, Most of the Project Completed, 20,000 Laborers Excavating River Channels</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Construction Department plans to enable the river and canal intermodal transport. The construction of a water pumping station in Weijiashan, Dong'a, will use water from the Yellow River to increase the water volume of the northern section of the Grand Canal and restore navigation, so that ships can directly reach Tianjin and Tanggu. The entire project started in November last year and has been mostly completed so far. The remaining projects are being rushed, and they can all be completed by next spring. As for the river channel of the northern section of the Grand Canal, it was excavated once the year before last. Because of the flood that year, the work was not neat, and much of the excavated soil was washed back into the river. Therefore, the river channel is still very high. The Shandong Yellow River and Grand Canal Intermodal Transport Engineering Office of the Construction Department decided to re-excavate and deepen it. This spring, the province organized labor service, and originally planned to include the excavation of the Northern Grand Canal project. However, due to too many projects to be handled, it was delayed until now. The project is in the territory of Yanggu and Dong'a counties, and laborers are conscripted for work. From the 7th to the 11th of this month, they started work one after another. More than 7,000 laborers arrived in Yanggu, and 80% of the project has been completed. More than 12,000 laborers arrived in Dong'a, and 90% of the project has been completed. The order is neat and the progress is smooth. The Construction Department sent Zhao Dongsheng, an engineer from the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau, to supervise the work. The two departments also sent personnel to survey the river to organize the projects. In the coming spring, all the projects will start. After the peach and plum blossoms bloom next year, the shadows of sails and the sounds of oars will be seen again on the Grand Canal, restoring the shipping that has been interrupted for decades. Not only will it be convenient for passengers and goods to be transported, but the prosperity along the river can also be expected in the near future.</p>
<p>The Yellow River and Grand Canal Intermodal Transport Engineering Office has listed various projects and is carrying them out one by one. The recent progress is as follows: 1. The Weijiashan Pumping Station Project started at the end of November in the 24th year and was completed on September 20th in the 25th year. 2. The Zhougong River Crossing Tunnel Project started in late April this year and was completed on August 10th. 3. The Waterfall Tunnel Project started in mid-June and was completed in early September. 4. The Sedimentation Area and Water Absorption Project started in late June and was completed in late September. 5. The Zhoujiadian Yuehe Tunnel Project started in late June and will be completed at the end of October. 6. The Zhoujiadian Ship Lock Project started in late June and has now completed 27%. 7. The Diversion Gate Project started in late July and was completed in early October. 8. The Linqing Ship Lock Project. 9. The Taochengbu Movable Bridge Project has now started. 10. The Tu Hai River Crossing Tunnel Project. 11. The Repair of the Weiwan Three-Arch Bridge Project has now been tendered. 12. The Majia River South Branch Crossing Tunnel Project. 13. The Majia River North Branch Crossing Tunnel Project. 14. The Zhangguanying Crossing Tunnel Project. 15. The Canal Gate Office Housing Project. 16. The New Tunnel Project on the Northern Grand Canal. The above five projects have not yet started.</p>

Yesterday, they took the original boat back home. When passing through the Wusong River, they suddenly encountered two bandit boats, carrying more than 20 bandits, threatening them with box cannons, handguns, bayonets, and other weapons.

<h3>Changshu Fire in Dongmennei</h3>
<p>At noon on the 14th, while a public air defense propaganda conference was being held in this county, a paper box shop east of the former detention center in Xin County, Dongmennei, suddenly caught fire. At that time, all the firefighters were attending the conference and could not rush to the scene in time, resulting in the fire spreading to as many as nine shops, destroying more than 30 houses, and killing two firefighters. It turned out that the county's air defense headquarters held an air defense propaganda conference, and tens of thousands of people participated. Unexpectedly, the kitchen in the Xing Hengxing paper box shop in Xin County suddenly caught fire, and in a short time, the fire spread to the left and right residences and the opposite side. When the firefighters gathered at the camp and set off, the fire had spread to a small neighborhood. When the firefighters were fighting the fire, Liu Yaodong, a firefighter from the northeast district, Zhu Sansan from the east district fire brigade, and Lu Gengsheng bravely climbed onto the roof. The overhead power line suddenly broke and landed on the bodies of the firefighters, electrocuting them immediately. They fell from the roof. Liu and Zhu died on the spot, and Lu Gengsheng and Zhao Yongsheng were rescued after being sent to the hospital. This time, the Xing paper box shop, Jin Yunji antique shop, and the families of Fang Ziqing, Xue Laotai, Zhang Xuehua, Tang Qiyao, Zhou Fengshan, Xing Chuansheng, Gao, and Tao were all destroyed, with total losses amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. As for the firefighters Liu Yaodong and Zhu Sansan who died on duty, the county government held an emergency meeting in the afternoon and decided to allocate 340 yuan for funeral expenses first and then raise pensions, and selected a cemetery for a public funeral to show mourning. In addition, when the fire was raging, the prisoners in the west suddenly rioted and escaped a smoker. The situation was tense for a while until all the city gates were notified to close and the smoker was caught.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Public Security Bureau Implements Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Zhang Da, the director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, believes that since the police district system in this county has been implemented since the 1st of this month, local security and anti-banditry matters should be more carefully deployed to ensure that the local people live and work in peace. The household registration investigation of the various sub-bureaus in the city and countryside is limited to being completed before the end of December. This winter defense is scheduled to be implemented starting today (16th). The bureau ordered the various sub-bureaus and teams to send the patrol and mutual sentry methods to the bureau for verification. The detective team should equip a larger Wuxi map.

Rongquan replied that he was too late, and he was slapped several times. Then they rummaged through boxes and baskets and looted at will. He was robbed of legal tender, gold and silver jewelry, and clothes, with an estimated loss of two to three hundred yuan. The victim, Gu Fuquan, did not want to invite resentment, so he did not report to the bureau for arrest. The village has a large area, with more than 900 households. There has never been a robbery case. This time, the Gu Fuquan family was robbed. It was definitely not an outsider, but someone from this village. In addition, the Zhou A'er family, a resident of Youxiangshang, He Township, Third District, was also robbed by more than a dozen bandits, with losses of more than four hundred yuan.</p>

Unexpectedly, when they reached a quiet place behind the Beidawang Temple, four thugs suddenly appeared and blocked their way, intending to rob them. Jinhai saw that it was not far from the village, so he shouted for help. The villagers came, each carrying farm tools to catch the thugs. Seeing that the situation was not good, the thugs scurried away. One of them was unable to escape and hid in the lotus pond. He was caught and sent to the Second Police Station of the nearby First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.

<h3>Lauer Tries His Hand for the First Time, Donghua Wins by Four Goals, the Enemy is Brave but Imprudent, Strength is Average, Donghua's Victory Depends Entirely on Effective Cooperation</h3>
<p>The enemy is brave but imprudent, the strength is average, Dong's victory depends entirely on effective cooperation. The Donghua Football Team defeated the Lauer Army, which recently came to Shanghai, with extremely strict defense and extremely fast feet, winning by four goals. Dai Linjing's two shots were beautiful and can be called the masterpiece of this season. Lauer is stationed in Singapore and came to Shanghai for the first time to showcase his football art. He also met the strong Donghua team, which seemed to have considerable appeal, but yesterday the two opposite command stages of the city sports ground were only half full, and there were only three or four hundred people sitting scattered on the left and right sides of the stage. In total, there were only over a thousand people. The decline in the appeal of maritime football matches can be used as strong evidence by the dedication and birthday celebration competition between Shenyuan French Business and Donghua last week. Not to mention that the road in the city center is long and far, and you have to go through a section of "Humen Pass."</p>
<p>Lauer is brave but imprudent. Lauer's treasure power can only be called "mediocre." There is more courage than enough, but not enough art. There is less considerable attainment in the control of the ball and the strategy of defense and attack. The forwards cannot respond and support each other, so they cannot shoot near the goal, and there is no way to break the opponent's defense line. They only use long shots, which is a desperate measure, trying to make Zhang Rongcai show his skills greatly, saving many wonderful balls. The rear runs out very far, and there is no communication with each other. The guards are not strict, so that the forwards can all give full play to their duties. Although the technique of guarding the goal cannot be saved, it is quite flustered and fragile to watch his usual ball-saving work. The right wing has very good feet, but being closely monitored by Gu Shangdong, he cannot use it to the extreme. The central defender is also a strong man. Several free kicks in front of the Donghua gate were all kicked by this princess, which was extremely beautiful and moving. The art of the whole team is far from that of Lancashire.</p>
<p>The Donghua lineup is closely linked. The Donghua Lien Rong is very tight, both offensive and defensive, and never懈怠。 The reason is that there are strangers in front of them, and they do not know their reality. Dai Linjing's performance was the most outstanding. The second and third goals were incredibly beautiful, only Dai could do it. Wu Binghao's position as Dai Wanxianghua was slightly weak. The front and back guards were all very outstanding. Zhang Rongcai saved many long balls and won a lot of applause. In the first half, Donghua only scored one goal by Xu Wenkui. In the second half, Dai Linjing scored two goals in the first five minutes, and then Xu Wenkui scored another goal, ending with a score of four to zero.</p>
<p>Scored a goal within five minutes. Donghua kicked off and attacked first, and was intercepted by Lauer and窜入。 The left wing kicked a corner kick out of bounds. Wu Binghao first shot towards the enemy's goal, which was caught by goalkeeper Ellis. Jia Youliang got the pass from Dai Linjing and sent it to the front of the goal. At that time, Lauer's two guards were too far away from the goal to return in time. Xu Wenkui窜至the front and kicked it into the goal. Only five minutes from the start of the game, Lauer's strength made the audience get a general idea. Although he repeatedly tried to invade, he had no skills in shooting and could not penetrate into the forbidden area. Dai Linjing got a very good opportunity, Lauer's defense was not strict, which made the Donghua forwards very active.</p>
<p>The enemy army showed strength but achieved nothing. At 18 minutes, Donghua was fined a free kick at the right oblique angle of 25 yards in front of the goal. Xia Bo'er, the right inner forward of the enemy team, took the kick. Center forward Mao Fude tried to shoot the ball, and Li Ning saved the state and heavy siege. After struggling for a short time, Zhuang Youren was again penalized for a foul and was kicked into a baseball. Donghua attacked again, Xu Jia mutually violated the offside, Lin Jing got the pass from Wu Binghao, took advantage of the other side's emptiness, lifted his foot and buckled the door, but the foot was not accurate, the ball was weak,掠门out of bounds. After that, Donghua had several emergencies, and Chen Zhenhe saved the Lord alone, which was a great achievement. The enemy army continued to press, with many beautiful long passes, and the foot was extremely clear and pleasing to the eye. Only because the Donghua wall was heavily guarded, the enemy riders could not penetrate into the hinterland.</p>
<p>Lin Jing Lianzhong is beautiful and pleasing to the eye. In the course of the competition, Dongyi was suddenly penalized again, the location was 40 yards in front of the goal, Lauer Lai Ai. De directly猛射towards the door, the ball was smooth and sharp, very beautiful, but unfortunately差以毫原,越门and out. Before long, the first half ended, and the rest continued to fight. The enemy's center forward Mao Fude and the left wing Kerayton switched positions, but the situation did not develop significantly. Dai Center Forward got Wu Binghao's supply and shot the corner of the goal, only then did the ball go in, even if Ellis had three heads and six arms, he would never be able to save it. Lao Yili kicked off, fell in one go, and Donghua was fined a free kick in front of the goal again. Lai Aide's foot was strong, and the ball landed like an arrow穿向the door, Zhang Rongcai仆地托and out, Wen Kui引球進攻阻at Nair, Jia Youliang stepped forward to接應送to the door, Lin Jing乘球尚下落地,With a quick foot, the side鈞入門,Beautiful and pleasing to the eye, can't see it again, Donghua then遥占the winning situation by three to zero,离下半时开始祇five minutes.</p>
<p>Wen Kui is active and made another contribution. The enemy army tried to挣扎,Huai Aiding once打门very good, but unfortunately not in, Donghua offensive is very盛,At 15 minutes, Xu Wenkui made another contribution. Donghua was suddenly penalized again in front of the door. Lai Aide kicked it very urgently, Rong Cai蹲下抱hold it, the enemy army再进中原,But can only益旋at the penalty line,無懈可擊,Dai Linjing出没敌阵,与老孙等呼应有方,The enemy was busy招架,Once戴引球穿过敌人,直趋门前,Lightly拨向the door,Unexpectedly, the intention of others failed,滚出门边,After that Dai Xu射一次each,Both are中门弹return,What a pity,But has使爱利斯惊惶失措矣,鸣令收军,Donghua以四比零奏凯,Referee Heil,</p>

<h3>Hard Court Tennis Men's Doubles – Ma Anquan and Zhou Guanjun Win Championship – Defeat Li Guofan and Hu Xuguang Three to One – All Hard Court Championships for This Year Resolved</h3>
<p>This year's Shanghai Hard Court Tennis Championships, organized by the French Chamber of Commerce, were all concluded yesterday. The men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles championships were all resolved yesterday. The men's doubles championship was won by Zhou Guanjun and Ma Anquan. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's Doubles Final</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Final</p>
<p>The Zhou-Ma versus Li-Hu doubles final was the main event of the day, but it was not very exciting. Only the first set had some competition and was somewhat interesting. After that, it was all one-sided, with Li and Hu almost giving up without a fight. In the Zhou-Ma pair, Zhou Guanjun was the weaker link, so he became Li and Hu's target. They concentrated their attacks on Zhou Guanjun alone, but the ball did not kill anyone, and instead, touched the net first and died. This happened repeatedly. They even lost six consecutive games in the third set. The fourth set was completed in a dispirited manner. The awards were then presented by Mrs. Carson and the event ended.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Literacy Campaign Shows Results – More Than 370,000 National People's Schools Established – Shanghai County Starts Compulsory Education Today</h3>
<p>Illiterate old and young people across the country originally accounted for more than seven-tenths of the population. In recent years, the government has vigorously promoted the literacy movement and seen results. This year, the Ministry of Education investigated the number of out-of-school people aged 16 to 50 across the country, accounting for half of the country's population. The Ministry of Education calculated that there were approximately 3 million school-age children and approximately 160 million older people. According to statistics, there are more than 17,000 people's schools already established nationwide, with a total of more than 1.2 million students and an annual expenditure of more than 1.9 million yuan. If the number of schools is increased every year and the public is forced to become literate, illiteracy can be eliminated within ten years. The Beijing Municipal Compulsory Education Fund has been finalized, with the Ministry of Education subsidizing 100,000 yuan each year. In addition, the Municipal Government requested the Ministry of Education to increase it by 50,000 yuan, and the Municipal Government also allocated 150,000 yuan. The total compulsory education fund for the whole year is 200,000 yuan.

<h3>Zhang Yuanruo Broadcasts a Speech – "Support the Leader" and Self-Reliance to Save the Country (4)</h3>
<p>4. The Awakening of National Self-Reliance</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can recognize a basic principle that is consistent with the nation, and that is the "self-reliance doctrine" that I have been advocating in recent years. Regarding the interpretation of "self-reliance doctrine," I have only written a special book (Note 12) and have also given public lectures (Note 13), so I will skip it for now. When we study the principles of the world, although there are countless changes, there is ultimately a certain and unchanging causal relationship and a proper order. We cannot abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial, nor can we reverse the cause and effect. In terms of national strength, the elements of national strength, as expressed in the group, are certainly the centripetal force of the masses. What is contained in the individual is the autonomy of each person. The former is the result and the superficial, while the latter is the cause and the fundamental. Therefore, if we want to achieve the strength of a country, we must first seek the full and sound development of each citizen's intelligence, morality, and physical strength. In other words, it is to seek the increase of national self-reliance.</p>
<p>Judging from a historical perspective, the revitalization and development of a nation, no matter what its national policy or doctrine is, in the initial stage, there is no exception to the preparation for self-reliance by the whole country. Far away, such as Gou Jian's breeding and training, the European Renaissance, and the Japanese Meiji Restoration, are precedents for self-awareness and self-reliance. In recent times, such as the revitalization of Turkey and Germany, and the development of Soviet Russia and Italy, are they not also the results of the hard work of the whole country and the use of everyone's strength? Based on this historical belief, therefore,</p>
<p>Self-reliance is the central criterion of all national salvation theories.</p>
<p>Self-reliance is the basic driving force of all national salvation movements.</p>
<p>No matter what the belief or goal, starting from the bottom and working towards the top, and starting from the near and working towards the far, in a certain relationship of historical evolution, everyone should start with self-effort as the starting point and baseline. People must first have the ability to act on their own before they can participate in joint efforts (Note 14).</p>
<p>In the past, all the vigorous movements in China only had temporary excitement and no lasting power, only superficial show and no practical results. In the past, all the efforts of patriotic people in China, and all the propaganda of doctrines and theories, could not promote China or save China. The root cause of their failure can be said to be the lack of self-awareness and self-effort.</p>
<p>Hitler of Germany is known as a dictator, but he announced to his party members and the people:</p>
<p>"If we ask ourselves where the power to build and maintain the country lies, it is only the ability and determination to sacrifice personal interests and seek benefits for society (Note 15)."</p>
<p>"If a nation is lazy, cowardly, mediocre, and incompetent, it will often perish because of it (Note 16)."</p>
<p>"All human values ​​are inherent in personality. Every ideal and every achievement is the result of individual creation (Note 17)."</p>
<p>The crumbling and declining German nation was despised everywhere. The people must have faith in self-reliance in order to generate self-awareness before they can seek survival (Note 18).</p>
<p>Given the superiority of the German national character, their leader is still deeply concerned about the laziness, cowardice, mediocrity, and incompetence of his people, and must loudly call on them to stimulate their national self-confidence and self-awareness. It is also a subtle indication that "hard work and self-improvement" are the fundamental way to build the country and strengthen it. What leaders at home and abroad expect from their people is certainly the same heart and the same reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we truly love our leader, we should not passively let the leader fight alone. Actively, we should have the awareness of self-effort. National strength should certainly be concentrated, but first we should make self-effort, and then we can make a contribution. If we only make empty talk, may I ask what "strength" can be gathered, and what practical benefit will there be to verbal support and love? Even if the leader is steadfast, persevering, and fights alone, if the masses are unable to follow, they will still not be able to relieve his worries.</p>
<p>How can we save the country? We must strengthen national strength.</p>
<p>How can we show our love for the leader? We must concentrate national strength.</p>
<p>But how can national strength be concentrated? It depends on national self-awareness.</p>
<p>How can national strength be strengthened? First, we must make self-effort.</p>
<p>People all over the country, everyone should be in awe of the tragedy of destruction, recognize the opportunity for national rejuvenation, abandon personal interests, and refrain from frivolity. Each should complete their tasks from their respective positions, use self-reliance to strengthen national strength, and use self-reliance to revive the nation.</p>

<h3>Exhibition and Carnival at the School for the Blind and Mute</h3>
<p>The Shanghai School for the Blind and Mute held a performance exhibition and carnival yesterday and today. Many Chinese and foreign people went to visit. The displayed paintings, sculptures, and other works were especially exquisite. Young people with disabilities can develop their talents to seek independence. The carnival performance started at 3 PM. The guests sat around the venue to watch. First was a chorus by the blind and a freehand exercise of stacking Arhats, followed by boxing by the mute boys and a pirate dance by the girls. The blind use their hands as eyes, so they touch with both hands when advancing or retreating. Although the movement is slow, the order is quite good. Especially the section on stacking Arhats received a lot of praise. The mute students use flags as commands for their performances, and their movements are agile and neat. The mute students also talk to each other using gestures, and they can also teach by making sounds. They use the national phonetic symbols to mark out the sounds, and they can pronounce them after they have learned them, so as to express their meaning, but they cannot converse because they are deaf and cannot hear. The students also have a military band, which practices for about an hour every morning, so the results are very good. They also performed at the venue, and the event ended at 5 PM.</p>

<h3>Where Should We Go?</h3>
<p>— He Si</p>
<p>After Reading "The Story of National Crisis"</p>
<p>The state of China has reached a point today that can be described as precarious! International imperialism is openly dealing with this stagnant old nation as if it were a colony. Many depraved and inherently servile individuals within the country are content to regard it as a semi-colony. Although a few clear-headed individuals are vehemently crying out, the general populace remains asleep in their current complacency, asleep in their lack of awareness. Even as the cannons of the imperialists roar beside them, the dream of preserving their lives and possessions still clings to their drowsy eyes. At a time when alerts from North China are frequently arriving, there are still those who hope that the crisis will not cross the Yellow River and move southward, so as to realize their dream of temporary peace and security. This is not only true of the ignorant masses, but also of many who are attached to their personal wealth and possessions. Therefore, it is imperative to awaken the masses, to make them understand the origins of national humiliation, the progressive evolution of national humiliation, and the extent to which the greedy and insatiable nature of the imperialists has progressed. It is essential that the entire nation has a clear and correct understanding. The ways in which our country has been cleverly seized, plundered, nibbled, and devoured by imperialists in the past century must be made clear to the minds of the entire nation.</p>
<p>However, historical evolution is by no means a matter of a single day or night. The precarious state of our country, reaching its current state, is certainly not a fact created in a single day or night. Now, the general public, who are called awakened, do know the seriousness of national shame; but how many people can clearly understand the causes and consequences of national shame and the facts of the successive occurrences of national shame? This lack of awareness and vague sense of humiliation is naturally only enough to create some lively and energetic enthusiasm. It cannot thoroughly move the entire populace, make them feel the deep pain to the point of affecting their skin, and rise up to engage in a bloody and passionate movement for national salvation, survival, and revival. Therefore, it is necessary to trace the origins and seek the roots of the oppression our country has suffered from imperialists, to explain the process in detail, and to indicate the current situation, so that the general public can have a systematic understanding. Only by knowing how the so-called national shame came about, what a painful process it has gone through, and what a critical state it has reached, can people recognize a clear environment, choose the path they should take, and mobilize all the strength of the entire nation to rise up and fight the imperialists without hesitation for the sake of national liberation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament tells us: "To awaken the people." The so-called awakening of the people is to make the people aware of the country's situation, understand the country's humiliation, and rise up to fight for national liberation!</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Knowing shame is akin to courage." It is not that the people of our country lack great courage and willingly become meat on the chopping board for the world's imperialists to slaughter at will. The reason why the strength of the entire nation cannot be mobilized to contend with world imperialism is because they have not deeply felt the shame suffered by the country and the nation. The result of thousands of years of autocratic politics is that the fate of the entire nation is entrusted to the hands of the rulers. Those who created these national humiliations were the Manchu Qing Empire and the warlords of the Republic of China, who bore the responsibility of ruling. We have been heavily chained with the shackles of slaves, branded with the mark of slaves, and have never known to rise up to fight for this eternally irrecoverable slave status. We are pitiful people who have been sold by others and have not yet understood our own fate. This is our great shame, the great shame of our entire nation! We must rise up to break these shackles, wash away these humiliations, and we must first understand what kind of contract of indenture these treacherous rulers issued to others, tear it up in one breath, and rebuild an independent and free nation-state.</p>
<p>The "Story of National Crisis," recently published by the Kaiming Bookstore, traces the origins and explores the causes and consequences of the national humiliations our country has suffered in the nearly hundred years since the Opium War. It systematically narrates the facts of their progressive accumulation, and writes a history of national crisis in simple and clear language, giving us, the slaves who have been sold, an opportunity to understand our own destiny. After reading this book, I was greatly moved and would like to introduce it to the entire Chinese nation, who live in what is regarded as a colony. The author said in the preface, "A Letter to the Reader":</p>
<p>"I have often wanted to understand this: Why has our country reached this point? The danger of extinction has come before our eyes. Some of our brothers have already become slaves to others, and some are about to be chained as slaves... I have spent a lot of effort searching for these things, reading books several feet thick; I think that every Chinese person has the same question as me and wants to understand this, but not everyone has the time to do what I did. I want to tell what I know, so that everyone can know... After reading my book, if the reader can understand the situation of China being oppressed by the powers in the past century, then my purpose will be achieved."</p>
<p>I think that every Chinese person, everyone who still has the blood of Chinese ancestors flowing in their body, should read this book, especially the middle school students on whom the future life of the entire nation depends. This is now the treasure of our national salvation movement, the alarm to awaken the national soul! After reading this book, our blood will naturally boil, and our courage to revive the nation will naturally develop. We now have no way out, except to rise up, snap off our shackles, overthrow our enemies, and fight for the liberation of our nation!</p>
<p>This little book is divided into twenty lectures. Now, I will briefly write out the contents of each lecture below:</p>
<p>Lecture 1 "An Analogy" The author uses a chaotic family to compare the unpromising situation of this old country in the past hundred years, which has led to the coveting of outsiders, who first peeped outside the door, then broke down the door, and looted to their heart's content, giving an overview of the story of the whole book.</p>
<p>Lecture 2 "How They Bombed Open the Door" This is about how European countries were eager to find colonies, how they took a fancy to this old empire of China, and how they started trading in Guangzhou. As a result, how the Opium War brewed, making the face of this old empire smeared with the mark of shame for the first time. He wrote about the result of the Opium War: "The original intention of the British was only to achieve the purpose of trade. Now the Chinese court's flustered situation, the corruption of Chinese officials, and the incompetence of the generals and soldiers have been seen by him. He understands that such a big country is simply like a fat pig. Although there are many people, these many people do not love their country, and they don't even have food to eat." The corruption of the government and the suffering of the people at that time are written clearly.</p>
<p>Lecture 3 "Foreign Soldiers First Attacked the Capital" This tells the story of the Anglo-French allied forces attacking Beijing and burning down the Old Summer Palace. The author wrote the following words about the reasons for the fall of Beijing: "Although the weapons of the Chinese officers and soldiers were useless, it was not as easy as imagined for foreign troops to attack the capital. Unfortunately, when the allied forces attacked Tianjin and Beijing, only a few Chinese soldiers in the north resisted. Most of the Chinese troops were fighting the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the south, busy killing their own hungry brothers. It was too late to rescue the foreign troops attacking the north, so the Anglo-French allied forces easily advanced north."</p>
<p>Lecture 4 "Shanghai Has Flourished Like This" This lecture records that when the Taiping Army and the Qing Army were fighting fiercely, the country was turbulent, and the clouds of war were full, merchants from Britain, the United States, France, and other countries took the opportunity to occupy Shanghai and form a special area, as if it were an independent small kingdom. Gradually, they encroached on the judiciary and controlled the customs, and everything was managed by foreigners. Foreign troops also helped the Qing court fight the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. As a result: "The power of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was defeated by foreign troops, which had a great impact. At the same time, foreign troops massacred Chinese hungry people and shed a lot of blood; this blood irrigated the Shanghai that was sprouting, making it more lively day by day."</p>
<p>Lecture 5 "Russia Passing Through the Wall" This lecture records the story of China and Russia's past negotiations, losing land north of Northeast China that was larger than the area of Northeast China.</p>
<p>Lecture 6 "Ryukyu Was Made a Presentation Gift" This is about the story of the Eastern Neighbor first getting red eyes, using deception and intimidation to take Ryukyu as the first meeting gift.</p>
<p>Lecture 7 "Winning a Battle and Giving Away Territory" This records that China and France had a conflict over Annam. Liu Yongfu fought the French army in Liangshan. China won the battle, but Li Hongzhang was afraid of causing trouble, so he signed a treaty in Tianjin to return Annam to French protection.</p>
<p>Lecture 8 "The Fences in the Southwest Are Completely Demolished" This tells the story of the loss of the Southwest vassal states of Siam and Burma.</p>
<p>Lecture 9 "How Korea Was Lost" The author writes: "This time, the Chinese army's great defeat in Korea and Liaodong was really due to the fact that most of the generals leading the troops were rice buckets. One of them, called Wei Rugui, had been a general for decades and scraped together hundreds of thousands of fortunes. He was old and absolutely disregarded his responsibilities. When he led troops to Korea, his wife wrote to him, saying, 'You are old and have money, you should enjoy your old age, why bother to risk your life?' So Wei Rugui held this idea, and fled as soon as he saw the Japanese soldiers." This is such an outrageous thing!</p>
<p>Lecture 10 "The Lucky Place Was Not Carved Up" This talks about Japan and Russia fighting openly and secretly in Northeast China, taking China's land and rights as the target of their plunder, which aroused the ambition of Britain, France, Germany, and other countries to carve up China. As a result, our entire country was freely divided into spheres of influence by them. If the United States had not come out with the Open Door policy for its own benefit, they would have almost implemented the carve-up.</p>
<p>Lecture 11 "Pitiful Resistance Movement" This is the story of the ignorant and ridiculous Boxer Rebellion's anti-foreign movement. The invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance is also the most ravaged and most severely damaged story in the national humiliation.</p>
<p>Lecture 12 "One's Own Land, Another's Battlefield" This tells the story of the Russo-Japanese War, which arose from the Russo-Japanese War over the rights of Northeast China and the uneven distribution of spoils. They used our land as their battlefield.</p>
<p>Lecture 13 "Buying Slaves with Money" This lecture says that the powerful imperialists used various means of investing in factories and building railways to buy us as slaves.</p>
<p>Lecture 14 "Who Says It Still Looks Like an Begonia Leaf?" This says that the shape of China was originally like a begonia leaf. "Everyone has already discussed: the United States for Tibet, Russia for Mongolia, and Japan for Northeast China... If China does not fight a way out, Xinjiang, Suiyuan, and Chahar may not be owned by China, right?" Who says it still looks like an Begonia Leaf?</p>
<p>Lecture 15 "The Opening of the Monopoly Situation" This says that after the European War, the powers were unable to take care of themselves, and China was unable to strive for self-improvement, so Japan's monopoly situation was created; and China was the only sacrifice under the monopoly, allowing it to eat recklessly.</p>
<p>Lecture 16 "Struggling Again in a Balanced Situation" This is about the powers still paying attention to East Asia after the war. The Pacific Conference initiated by the United States gave Japan's monopoly situation a considerable restriction. At the same time, China's "May Fourth Movement" also gave the monopoly situation a considerable blow. So this unpromising country had to struggle again in the new balanced situation.</p>
<p>Lecture 17 "Do We Only Have the Share of Rolling Away?" What is said in the Tao is the story of our hungry brothers, crossing the ocean to find a hard meal abroad, and how they were abused or driven away.</p>
<p>Lecture 18 "Heroic Resistance" This lecture narrates the March 30th Massacre in Shanghai, the Shaji Massacre in Guangzhou, the struggle to unconditionally recover the British concession in Hankou, and the May 3rd Jinan Massacre. The Chinese people gradually raised their heads and were not afraid to shed hot blood to fight the imperialists.</p>
<p>Lecture 19 "The First Knife of Slaughter" This is about the disconnection of customs in Northeast China on September 18th, the War of Resistance in Shanghai on January 28th, and the establishment of the puppet Manchurian state like a monkey show.</p>
<p>Lecture 20 "Carving Up? Swallowing Alone? Or Revival?" "What will be the fate of China in the future? Swallowed alone by Japan? Carved up by the powers? Or unwilling to be like the unpromising India, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, to revive and build an equal and reasonable plan?" "Carving up? Swallowing Alone? Revival?—Our China has come to such a three-way intersection. Where should we go!" This is the author's last cry!</p>
<h3>How to Read and Write?</h3>
<p>— Wen Liang</p>
<p>The Most Important Thing Is to Understand the Method Problem</p>
<p>No matter what you do, the most important thing is the method problem. With the method, not only is it easy and enjoyable to do, but it also takes less time and achieves excellent results. For example, a person who goes out to travel has a travel guide. He travels according to the method indicated in the travel guide. He will not spend more time, money, or energy, and can fully enjoy the fun of the trip. Reading and writing are also like this. If you understand the methods of reading and writing, you will get twice the result with half the effort; if you don't understand the method, it is like walking into a dead end, and there is no way to get out. Therefore, when reading and writing, we must understand how to read and how to write.</p>
<p>Now there are many young men and women, they feel a headache when they hear the word "reading"; students in school also hate "writing" very much, so in class, they often sleep, talk, and read novels, and when it comes to writing, if they encounter some lazy teachers, then they know themselves and each other, and they may not write once in a semester. Such schooling is just wasting the money earned from the blood and sweat of their fathers and brothers and their own precious time. It is completely deceiving others and oneself. It is better not to read and use this time, money, and energy to do some other work, which is more worthwhile. This kind of student's self-abandonment is not the attitude that reading should have. But at the same time, the teacher who only teaches dead books and does not teach the method to the students is also difficult to escape the blame. Although some teachers pay attention to the method problem, there are still many who teach students to read dead books.</p>
<p>It is of course very good that teachers in school focus on guiding us on the method problem when we read and write; otherwise, we should buy a few books on the method problem to read; it is like we are going to travel, and no one is guiding us, we must also find a travel guide to browse. Books on the method of reading and writing were not easy to find in bookstores more than ten years ago; even if you could find them, they were only a few very brief ones. Now, there are many such books. For example, taking Kaiming Bookstore as an example, there are:</p>

<p>If scholars have read the above books once, they will understand the methods of reading and writing, and they will not feel a headache when they see books, and reading will be more interesting. As for writing, even if you say that you can't write very well, at least you won't be said to be incomprehensible. Now, I will talk about the general idea of ​​the above books!</p>
<p>"Student Learning Method" This is a small booklet, written by a foreign university professor, based on his many years of experience in researching knowledge, and written in a concise manner. Kang Gu Jun translated it into our national language very faithfully because this kind of work is helpful to students' study problems. Because this book is thin, it is not very laborious for us to read. "How to Read" This is a book that collects articles by domestic scholars on the methods of reading. This is a book in which our famous domestic scholars sincerely describe their experience in researching knowledge. If we follow their guidance to study, we can spend a small amount of energy and time to obtain a lot of knowledge and learning. "Middle School Subject Learning Method" This is a method in which many famous people each describe the knowledge they have researched. Now many people often have no interest in a certain subject, which is because they don't understand the learning method for a certain subject. This book talks about each subject, so it can be said to be a good book that every student must have. "The Art of Reading" "Learning and Tempering" These are two books from the Middle School Magazine Series. Other books that talk about learning methods often invite university professors or specialized scholars to write, but they often do not understand the psychology and level of middle school students, so the works they have written with great effort are often not very suitable for middle school students. These two books are aimed at middle school students, so middle school students read them with more intimacy and taste. "The Health and Diseases of Writing" This is also from the Middle School Magazine Series. The articles in it guide middle school students on how to write healthily and how to increase a lot. "Writing Method" This book has long been popular all over the country, and everyone believes that it is the best book on writing methods today. It describes in detail the genres of various articles, the methods of writing, and the key points of proposition. Not only can we use it as a textbook, but it is also very suitable for self-study. "Grammar and Composition" The author spent more than ten years of hard work in a middle school and wrote this book based on his actual experience, which is of course more valuable than other people's works. "Essays Writing Method" is the author's lecture notes when teaching writing methods in school. Several schools have adopted it as a textbook, and everyone feels that it is very practical. Because the composition in ordinary schools now is mostly essays, this book is worth everyone's attention. The book "Literary Mind" uses the genre of novels to write about the story of writing. When we read it, it is not only like reading a novel, but also in watching the novel, we can get a lot of methods of reading and writing, so this book is very popular in society, and every middle school student should have one on their desk.</p>
<p>I am a teacher of Chinese language. Because students recently asked me about reading and writing, I said the above words to the students. Also, because many people also need these words, so I humbly send them to the reading club.</p>
<h3>A Word to Middle School Magazine</h3>
<p>— Gu Ji</p>
<p>I am a new subscriber to Middle School Magazine, but the impact it has had on my mind was felt several years ago.</p>
<p>It was probably when I had just left school, when I accidentally read this book somewhere, and I was so happy that I couldn't bear to let go. However, because the book belonged to someone else, I was unable to read it to my heart's content. Later, due to economic reasons, I couldn't even go to school, and I never subscribed to it.</p>
<p>It wasn't until last year that I finally managed to grab a broken rice bowl for selling my labor, earning fifty-six cents as the price of a day's blood and sweat. In addition to simple food and clothing, I could actually save a few extra dollars each month. I had always felt that it was a pity to waste my free time in loneliness, and I wanted to find a way to seek some knowledge. I had even spent an extremely cheap price to buy some novels at a discount, but they were of no benefit. It was only when I saw the advertisement for Middle School Magazine that I recalled my desire from a few years ago and decided to subscribe without delay.</p>
<p>Since getting this book, I, who had always been self-pitying and self-blaming, seemed to have suddenly climbed from darkness to a place of light, and my interest in doing everything had increased a lot. Every time I just took it from the post office. When holding it to read, I would mutter to myself "Hmm...". It contains the sound of "everything is clear". It can be seen how great its magic power is to me.</p>
<p>The four kinds that I am most interested in in the book are Sui Bi, Novel Youth Literature, and Youth Forum. The literary and forums belonging to young people are especially important to my faith. When I check its length in each issue, I find that it is gradually expanding, and I always feel very happy. The authors inside are probably university and middle school students. In school, they have certainly undergone a turn of tempering for writing skills, and the published works have been rendered by the editors, so there is no boring taste at all. This is the reason why I like to read the most.</p>
<p>Looking at other people's beautiful works made me, who had no skills, also aroused the ambition to try. I once boldly combined the fantasies and facts that I felt and wrote novels, essays, and other things. But after writing, when I pick it up and read it again, I always feel that it is not appropriate. Over time, although I was thinking hard, not only did I not write something tidy, but I just filled the wastebasket. Later I realized that if I want to write a good article myself, I must first carefully appreciate and chew other people's works, chew them thoroughly, and then dissolve them into my own heart and irrigate my emotions. This may still have some effect.</p>
<p>Originally, when I read books, I only knew how to "swallow whole", as for its structure and so on, I didn't hear or ask, so the interest in the book was naturally not very strong. After being awakened by Middle School Magazine, I realized that reading is not an easy thing.</p>
<p>I am now very willing to always be its most loyal disciple, hoping that it will continue to irrigate my heart and enlighten my intellect with all kinds of sweet nectar, giving me a good achievement.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I have to worry about whether this old friend, who I exchange with blood and sweat in this year, can be extended. Whether the fifty-six cents continues to be the same unreduced fifty-six cents, I can't help but put the sorrow of the clouds on the blurred heart.</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Collection of Donations to Comfort Soldiers at the Front Lines and Collection of Donations From All Sectors on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>In recent days, the fighting in eastern and northern Suiyuan has intensified. The outposts have already begun to engage. Across the vast expanse of the river, the battle lines stretch, and the soldiers stand ready, guarding our national territory. Their loyalty and bravery are admired by all the people of the nation. For the troops at the front, the first priority is a sufficient supply of provisions, and even more important is high morale. All of our countrymen share a deep sense of solidarity in resisting the bandit armies, and we should naturally provide material comforts to the soldiers. Now, this newspaper and all its staff have already collected 2,000 yuan yesterday, which has been telegraphed to Chairman Fu of Suiyuan through the Bank of China for distribution nearby. At the same time, the Shanghai and Nanjing offices of this newspaper will begin collecting donations from all sectors. In addition to issuing receipts for the donations, the titles of the donating gentlemen will be published in the newspaper the following day to demonstrate our integrity. It is hoped that the people of the country will be inspired by this and that we can accumulate little by little to provide warmth to the soldiers in the freezing snow. This newspaper sent a telegram to Chairman Fu, which reads: "Chairman Fu of Suiyuan, we salute you. In recent days, the bandits have been creating disturbances on the border, attempting to encroach on our territory. Fortunately, the soldiers at the front, under your command, are displaying great courage and determination to launch an attack. Upon hearing the news of the first outpost engagement, we deeply felt the shared hatred of the entire nation and decided to make contributions to express our respect and support. We have now collected 2,000 yuan in national currency from this newspaper and its staff and have entrusted it to the Bank of China to be telegraphed to your headquarters, either for use as comfort funds or to meet urgent needs. The distribution is at your discretion. Although this small amount is hardly sufficient to strengthen our defenses, our sincere intentions represent a small contribution from the citizens. We hope you will accept it. The Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper and all its staff respectfully salute."</p>
<h3>Actively Moving Forward with the Joint National Products Business Company; Enthusiastic Support from Both the National Products and Financial Sectors; The Financial Sector Forms a Banking Group to Invest Four Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The National Economic Construction Movement Committee Headquarters is establishing a National Products Business Company. Various sectors of the national products and financial communities in this city have expressed their support and enthusiastic participation. A general outline of the measures has been agreed upon and is being actively pursued, with a deadline of formally establishing the company within three months. The details are explored below:</p>
<p>Joint Discussions Between the Two Sectors</p>
<p>In recent years, with the gradual development of domestic manufacturing, efforts to promote national products have also been actively carried out. A few years ago, with the assistance of the banking sector, various manufacturers established national products companies, setting up more than ten locations, which have already laid a considerable foundation. However, the strength is still not concentrated. Now, under the advocacy of the National Economic Association, efforts are being made to organize a joint business company. The national products and financial sectors are very excited and have been holding joint discussions in Shanghai for several days. It has been decided to send representatives to Beijing this week to consult with the Association and the Ministry of Industry. It is expected that the company can be established in early March next year. A board of directors will be established in the capital, and an office will be established in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Outline of Measures</p>
<p>The outline of the measures for the joint business company is as follows: (1) Purpose: Under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry, the purpose of this company is to promote national products, i.e., to seek the development of locally produced goods, manufactured goods, handicrafts, and cooperation with all parties to establish national products companies in various places. (2) Name: This company is named the China National Products Joint Business Co., Ltd. (3) Organization: Under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry, this company will be temporarily formed by the joint investment of the central and local governments, national products factories, and national products companies (including national products introduction centers and national products markets). (4) Capital: The capital of this company is temporarily set at two million yuan, with the central government and local governments jointly subscribing to one-third, various national products factories jointly subscribing to one-third, and the currently established national products companies (including national products introduction centers and national products markets) jointly subscribing to one-third. Shares will be paid in installments in accordance with the Company Law. (5) Business: The business operations of this company are as follows: A. Establishing national products companies in various places and subsidizing their capital. B. Distribution and sales of products from national products factories in various places. C. Distribution and sales of handicrafts and special products from various places. D. Expansion of overseas markets. E. Liaison with domestic consumption cooperatives and distribution of goods. F. Financial regulation of national products companies in various places. G. Special banking groups to regulate the financing of both production and sales. H. Review and supervision of the operations of various national products companies. I. Training of national products trade personnel.</p>
<p>Points to Note</p>
<p>The following three points should be noted in the operation of the business: A. National products companies in various places should make full use of local human and material resources, and their capital should be borne by local people as much as possible. If there is a shortfall, it will be subsidized by the company. B. Effectively liaise with consumer cooperatives in various places to promote the sales of national products. In addition to properly determining the principles, the methods of liaison should be handled according to the circumstances in each place. C. National products companies that have already been established, whether or not they have investment from this company, should recognize this company as a joint organization. The specific measures will be determined separately. If necessary, this company may provide appropriate investment. The financial sector is currently conducting a detailed study of the business methods, organizational structure, and the relationship between the head office and national products companies in various places. For example, in the existing national products companies, goods are consigned for sale by factories, which may reduce costs, but the business is not competitive, and the factories are unwilling to give priority to delivery, which is a drawback. This needs to be changed in the future. When the company is established in the future, the existing joint office of national products companies will be merged into it, and the existing eleven national products companies in Shanghai and other places will also be included in its system.</p>
<p>Banking Group to be Formed</p>
<p>As for the company's funds, it is no longer a problem. The total capital is two million yuan, with the government subscribing to one-third, various national products factories jointly subscribing to one-third, and the existing national products companies (i.e., national products introduction centers, the national joint office of national products companies, and production and sales associations) jointly subscribing to one-third. After half of the capital, i.e., one million yuan, is paid up, the company will be organized and established in accordance with the Company Law. It is more difficult for national products factories to raise funds, and the financial sector has already provided advance loans for shares under the most favorable conditions, which will be repaid by deducting a percentage of the sales revenue. In addition, the financial sector is organizing a banking group to invest in the company as working capital, with the total amount temporarily set at four million yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Stationed in Positions; Still Not Withdrawn Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, Japanese troops have been stationed at key intersections in the Hongkou District since the 14th. As of 12:00 noon yesterday, they had still not been withdrawn. Moreover, the number of Japanese troops stationed along Laobazi Road and Wusong Road increased from four to seven yesterday. At the same time, they all wore gray bulletproof vests and maintained close vigilance. Groups of seven or eight Japanese soldiers also patrolled the roads from time to time. The situation appeared to be quite serious. The purpose of this sudden action by the Japanese troops has not been announced. When reporters went to inspect yesterday morning, they saw trucks loaded with white bags still running between Yangshupu and the Japanese military headquarters, delivering military supplies. Moreover, some of them were even heading to western Shanghai. However, there were no other special changes. Therefore, the surface situation remained peaceful. In Zhabei, except for the more than eighty Japanese troops stationed in the Japanese brewery behind Huayuan Street, who had not been withdrawn, there were no other special circumstances.</p>

The Belgian Minister to China, Ji Youmu, just returned to his country for vacation this summer. It is said that the two countries are planning to upgrade their diplomatic envoys.</p>

However, at that time, the repatriation of Guangxi had not been completed, the transportation was inconvenient, and the provincial government was moving to Guilin, which had not been completed either. Therefore, he stayed in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and had not entered Guangxi. Later, because the preliminary election of Guangxi had already been completed, he stopped entering Guangxi. He had not heard anything about whether Bai Chongxi would go abroad for inspection. However, Mr. Bai decided to go to Nanjing first after all the repatriation matters were completed.

The original request of the branches is recorded as follows: "Request for presentation: In recent days, the newspapers have reported that the bandit-puppets in Chahar, under the instigation of a certain country, are rapidly invading Suiyuan. Fierce battles have broken out in Taolin, Xinghe, and Wuchuan. Although our soldiers at the front have the determination to defend our territory, they rely on the support of the rear. Moreover, the severe winter is approaching, and snow has already fallen on the border. We should provide practical assistance to the soldiers fighting for the survival of the nation in this freezing weather to boost their morale. Therefore, our branches propose that your association immediately convene a temporary emergency representative meeting to discuss assistance strategies. The opinions of our branches are as follows: (1) Send a telegram to the soldiers in North China to provide spiritual comfort first. (2) Send a telegram to the government to provide practical assistance to the soldiers at the front in North China. (3) Launch a fundraising campaign to provide support to the front and material comfort to the soldiers. We request that this be submitted to the representative meeting for deliberation and handling. We hope you will consider it." It is also learned that the General Association of the Municipal Federation will convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss it, in order to encourage the morale of the front lines.</p>

<h3>The Nanyang Commercial Delegation Returns to Shanghai from Abroad Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial Delegation, organized by the China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association, has completed its tour of Nanyang to promote national products. The delegation of twelve, led by Director Gao Shiheng, is returning home on the French Postal Service's General Xiafei and has arrived in Hong Kong. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The China Industrial and Foreign Trade Association has issued a notice and it is said that many groups have registered to participate in the welcome. It is reported that the delegation spent a total of four months and two days from departure to return. Before the delegation left the country, there were deep concerns that this trip would not yield any new achievements. Later, with the urging of the Association's board of directors and the encouragement of the Ministry of Industry, they were able to complete the arduous task of making a comprehensive external promotion in the name of Chinese industry and commerce. The delegation's initial plan was only to conduct a comprehensive survey and research of Nanyang's business and did not consider making any business attempts. Unexpectedly, the warm welcome from the overseas Chinese was beyond expectations. Various merchants competed to place orders, with a total of more than 1.6 million yuan in orders placed in various places. This is only an initial trial run, and large orders are still to be expected in the future. Several factories have encountered difficulties because various merchants are vying to be their agents. As a result, the relevant trade association has jointly acted as an agent to show fairness. The overseas Chinese felt regret that there were thousands of factories in China, but only thirty-seven were represented on this trip. They hoped that there would be a more powerful delegation to go to Nanyang in the future. Therefore, most manufacturers in China had a wait-and-see attitude on this trip. Little did they know that the gains would be far beyond expectations. After the delegation's efforts, it has at least aroused the serious attention of the domestic industrial community. The delegation leader, Gao Shiheng, gave more than forty public speeches in various places, and the audience was very crowded, especially the students, with several thousand people gathering for each speech. In each place, overseas Chinese would visit the hostel throughout the day, inquiring about the domestic situation. It can be seen that the overseas Chinese are very patriotic. The local newspapers have also been making every effort to promote the delegation, making various announcements before the delegation arrived, and publishing long articles and photos every day after the delegation arrived, as well as publishing special issues or pictorials to attract the attention of the overseas Chinese. Although the delegation has been trying to reduce social events and do more work, banquets are still very busy. The local consulates have been providing full assistance to the delegation, mobilizing almost all their personnel to conduct business investigations and introduce visits to government authorities in various countries, so that the delegation's procedures have not been difficult at all. The delegation has already started drafting a report on the way, and all sectors in Shanghai are eager to read it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Inspectorate General of Customs, Mr. Maze, Published Report on Smuggling in North China Yesterday; Smuggled Goods are Mostly Stockpiled in Tianjin after Being Blocked from Moving South; The Difficulties of Customs Anti-Smuggling Work Have Not Been Reduced</h3>
<p>Regarding the current situation of smuggling in North China, Sir Frederick Maze, Inspector General of Customs, recently reported the details to the government. A reporter from the China News Agency specifically inquired about the main contents of the report from the Inspectorate General of Customs yesterday. According to Inspector General Maze in the report, the level of activity of smuggled goods in certain areas of North China seems to have decreased compared to before. However, there has been little significant progress in promoting anti-smuggling work. Mr. Maze continued that in recent months, the number of smuggled goods entering North China from eastern Hebei has indeed decreased. The reason for the decrease may be that the customs' road anti-smuggling work has been strictly enforced in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, making it impossible for smuggled goods to move south. As a result, the Tianjin smuggled goods market has become crowded and stockpiled again, so the entry of smuggled goods from eastern Hebei has naturally decreased compared to before. Since the establishment of the Road Anti-Smuggling Office, it seems to have achieved considerable and noteworthy success in preventing smuggled goods from operating in North China and the areas adjacent to Tianjin by appropriate means. However, if we observe further, we can know that this situation still belongs to the palliative aspect and cannot solve the fundamental difficulties. The unprecedented restrictions imposed on customs anti-smuggling work by the environment in North China have not been reduced.</p>
<h3>Restaurant Industry's Aviation Donation for September</h3>

<h3>Wireless Telephone Service Between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan to Officially Launch Within the Month; Call Types and Rates Finalized; Three-Minute Unit Rate is Five Dollars and Ten Cents</h3>
<p>The wireless telephone network connecting Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, has already established communication between Shanghai and Wuhan. Furthermore, trial calls between Shanghai and Guangzhou have been conducted several times with excellent results. The official launch is scheduled for within the month, and the rates have been agreed upon. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency has gathered details as follows:</p>
<p>Launch Within the Month</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in order to complete the wireless telephone network among Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, has instructed the Guangzhou Telephone Administration and the Shanghai Wireless Radio Station to actively prepare for the Shanghai-Guangzhou connection after initially connecting Shanghai and Wuhan. It is reported that the Guangzhou Wireless Telephone Station, since its construction, has conducted several trial calls with Shanghai and Wuhan separately. The sound quality was clear, and the results were quite good. Recently, the Shanghai Wireless Radio Station conducted a longer trial call with the Guangzhou Radio Station. Both parties were satisfied with the result. If time permits, the official launch is scheduled for this month. At that time, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Yangfu will conduct a formal call to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Four Connection Methods</p>
<p>(1) Telephone calls are divided into three types: (A) Registered calls, where only the recipient's phone number is specified, without the recipient's name; (B) Person-to-person calls, where a specific person is requested; and (C) Messenger calls, where the recipient does not have a telephone and the receiving telephone exchange must send a messenger to notify the recipient to go to the telephone exchange or a public telephone booth to speak. (2) All three types of calls above are divided into ordinary and urgent. Urgent calls will be prioritized. (3) Call duration is calculated in three-minute units. Calls lasting less than three minutes will be charged for three minutes. Calls lasting more than three minutes but less than six minutes will be charged for six minutes, and so on. (4) The duration of a call is calculated from the moment the calling party and the receiving party begin speaking. The duration of person-to-person and messenger calls is calculated from the moment the specified recipient begins speaking. (5) If a telephone call has been connected by the radio station, but the call cannot be completed because the recipient or the caller is unwilling to speak, or for other reasons, no call charges will be incurred. However, a cancellation fee must be paid separately.</p>
<p>Established Rates</p>
<p>(1) Wireless telephone rates between Guangzhou and Wuhan: Ordinary calls are 4.20 national currency dollars for every three minutes. Ordinary person-to-person and ordinary messenger calls are 5.10 national currency dollars for the first three minutes, and 4.20 national currency dollars for every three minutes thereafter.

<h3>Liquidator of Tong Yi Bank Calls for Shareholders' Meeting</h3>

<h3>Labor Unrest in Japanese Cotton Mills in Shanghai Seems to Subside on the Surface; Six Inland and Overseas Cotton Mills Still on Strike; Tong Xing No. 2 Mill in Pudong Not Fully Resumed; Factories in Puxi Convene Foremen to Discuss Solutions</h3>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the labor unrest in Japanese-owned cotton mills in Pudong has temporarily subsided after the Party and government authorities persuaded workers to reluctantly return to work. Workers at six inland and overseas cotton mills in Puxi are continuing their strike. Although factories have agreed to increase wages, labor unrest is still brewing. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pudong Has Not Fully Resumed Work</p>
<p>After Shanghai Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Mills, Tong Xing No. 2 Mill, Da Kang, Dong Hua, Gong Da, and No. 2 Mills in Pudong were earnestly persuaded by the Party and government authorities, workers obeyed the government's orders and most have reluctantly returned to work. Although some are still unwilling to return to the factories, the labor unrest is easing. Yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday, and the factories, except for Shanghai Mills, were shut down as usual, including Dong Hua and Tong Xing. Therefore, the atmosphere was quiet. The night shifts, however, resumed as usual. However, a large number of workers at Tong Xing No. 2 Mill have not yet resumed work. The other factories were paying wages, so all the workers went to the factories.</p>
<p>Foremen's Meeting in Puxi Factories</p>
<p>To avoid being caught in the strike vortex, the Japanese-owned cotton mills in Puxi decided to negotiate directly with the labor side and agreed to increase wages by 5%. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the factories took the opportunity to convene a meeting of foremen in the morning to discuss solutions. At the same time, the workers also held a meeting at a certain factory to discuss the situation. It is reported that some workers strongly advocated for a hard-line stance. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the labor unrest in Puxi can be quelled.</p>
<p>Six Inland and Overseas Mills Fail to Resume Work</p>
<p>At the Inland and Overseas Cotton No. 6 Mill on West Suzhou Road in Puxi, the entire workforce was outraged after a Japanese foreman beat a female worker in the fine yarn section and declared a strike. Factory manager Nakano Jia of the factory then negotiated with the heads of each team and decided to investigate the facts and take appropriate action. The workers had originally planned to resume work the night before last night, but temporarily, because the number of workers entering the factory was small, it was still impossible to start work. According to Hattori, the person in charge of the factory, all the workers are still on strike. However, the factory decided to sound the whistle and start work as usual for the night shift tonight (i.e., last night), hoping that the workers will enter the factory and resume work. However, according to the Da Gong News Agency reporter's investigation, the workers at the factory did not resume work last night. As for the adjacent No. 7 Mill of the same company, it was working as usual. Armed Chinese and Western detectives and several Japanese were stationed outside the factory gate, patrolling to prevent accidents. Other factories, such as Kiwa and Nichihua, were closed as usual for the Sunday holiday, and the night shifts resumed as usual.</p>
<h3>Fisheries Banking Syndicate Collects Fixed and Working Capital</h3>
<p>Shortens Preparations and Establishes Earlier; Promotes Fishermen to Organize Cooperatives</p>
<p>After the establishment of the preparatory office of the Fisheries Banking Syndicate of the Ministry of Industry, the location is on the upper floor of the Xinhua Bank on Jiangxi Road. As soon as the arrangements are completed, the office will begin operations. The organizational regulations and detailed rules of procedure have been submitted by the preparatory director Qian Xin-Zhi to the ministry for record. The preparation period is limited to three months. Now, in view of the urgent need for relief for fishermen in various places, in addition to the 120,000 yuan already collected by Xinhua Bank, China and South Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Association to be lent to fishermen in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, efforts are being made to shorten the preparation period and officially establish the syndicate earlier. Therefore, the collection of the 200,000 yuan of fixed capital guaranteed by the government and the 800,000 yuan of working capital subscribed by the China Communications Bank and other twelve banks has begun. At the same time, the situation of the fishing industry and existing fishing cooperatives is being investigated, and fishermen in various places are being promoted to quickly organize cooperatives. In the future, loans will be granted to fishing cooperatives in various places, and then the cooperatives will lend to their member fishermen. The loans will be in three forms: credit, mortgage, and overdraft. It was also decided to build new-style fishing vessels and lease them to fishermen.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Urges Factories to Register Promptly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs issued a notice stating that it had received Instruction No. 20945 from the Municipal Government, which approved Consultation No. 17520 from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the purpose of conducting factory registration is to thoroughly examine the entire industrial situation in the country in order to facilitate policy implementation. This is of great importance to the future of construction. The ministry has repeatedly requested and ordered strict supervision of the process. Although some have complied with the rules and submitted applications for registration, they are only a small number compared to the number of factories nationwide. This is due to the factories' disregard for official orders and hesitation to move forward, and the failure of the direct supervising authorities in various places to strictly supervise them in accordance with the rules is also one of the main reasons. Now, in order to vigorously complete factory registration to facilitate industrial administration planning and construction, the corresponding consultation requests your municipal government to instruct the competent bureau to strictly supervise and order all factories that should be registered to complete registration by the end of this year and submit them to the ministry for reference, etc. Upon approval of this, the bureau is ordered to comply and report back for reference. This order, etc. Upon receiving this, the bureau has repeatedly instructed all factories in the city area to comply and issued public notices for general knowledge in May of last year and January of this year. Now, it is found that many factories in the city have registered with the bureau, but there are still many that have not complied. At this time of vigorously implementing national economic construction, industrial construction is of paramount importance, and factory registration is the foundation of industrial administrative facilities. Compliance with the deadline and completion of registration should clearly identify the national factory situation, meticulously plan, and strive for industrial development. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 12 of the Ministry-promulgated revised Factory Registration Rules, the enforcement of registration has a mandatory nature, and those who do not legally register may be punished in accordance with the Administrative Enforcement Law, etc. In the past, the bureau did not strictly enforce this for the sake of alleviating commercial difficulties. However, the manufacturers have arbitrarily waited and watched, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, in accordance with previous orders, this notice is reissued to strictly urge all unregistered factories in the city to comply and quickly register with the bureau within the deadline and refrain from delaying any further. This notice is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Wang Yiting's Seventieth Birthday</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Launches Fundraising Drive to Construct Longhua Scenic Area</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yiting is a highly respected elder of our time, and as an artist, he has devoted himself to social charitable causes. His virtue and reputation are well-known at home and abroad. This year, December 22nd of the Gregorian calendar, which is the ninth day of the eleventh lunar month, marks Mr. Wang's seventieth birthday. Mayor Wu, in conjunction with Shanghai leaders Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xin-Zhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Yang Hu, Shen Yi, Cai Jingjun, Xu Peihuang, Yu Hongjun, Li Ting'an, Pan Gongzhan, and Xu Fu, has launched a fundraising drive to construct the Longhua Scenic Area in this city in order to celebrate the virtue of the worthy and demonstrate enduring remembrance. It is said that Mr. Wang has always been a devout believer, extending his piety to the merit of providing for construction. The planned projects are as follows: (1) Repairing the Longhua Temple Pagoda for visitors from home and abroad to admire; (2) Building three houses near the temple, named Yiting Hall, with a stone carving of Mr. Wang's portrait displayed inside; (3) Planting 10,000 peach trees in the Longhua area to enhance the scenery; (4) If there are surplus funds, they should be stored as a foundation for roofing repairs and tree planting. Mayor Wu has instructed Section Chief Li Dachao to handle the matter, and it is being actively pursued. It has also been learned that someone in Nanjing is falsely claiming to be celebrating Mr. Wang Yiting's birthday and soliciting donations from various agencies and leaders, which is an act of misrepresentation. All sectors are advised not to be fooled.</p>

A further telegram will be sent to argue for this point, and the original reply telegram will be forwarded to the public. (2) Review of the draft proposal to telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to rectify the administration of officials in various counties. The resolution was that the original letter was approved for printing and distribution.

(4) The Pinghu County Fisheries Preparation Committee requested this association to assist in restricting the fishermen of Songjiang Jinshanwei from fishing across borders, which harms the livelihood of fishermen in the county. This case has been forwarded to the provincial government. If no reply is received, another telegram will be sent to urge them. (5) Discussion of the Zhejiang Province's plan to raise grain reserves. The resolutions were: (1) Grain reserves should be established at the county and township levels in accordance with the ministry's regulations and should not be concentrated in the provincial capital.

A telegram will be sent to the ministry to argue for this point. Director Cha Zhongjian was assigned to draft the telegram. (6) Discussion of spreading methods for preventing drug use. The resolution was to compile, print, and distribute effective methods in a simple and detailed manner to achieve widespread adoption.

The association was requested to forward a letter to the Zhejiang Transport Administration to maintain the original tax rate in order to alleviate the people's hardship. The resolution was that the light tax could eliminate smuggling and the actual tax revenue would not be lost. The Zhejiang Transport Administration will be contacted for these reasons and to alleviate the people's hardship by maintaining the original tax rate. (8) The Yunye Reclamation Company has over 100,000 mu of mountain land, which is almost abandoned due to poor management.

Luo Zhengping delivered a response. The following resolutions were passed by the general meeting: (1) Zhang Yixin, a member of the executive committee of this session, has resigned from his position as a member of the executive committee due to the reorganization of his company and the transfer of the manager. The executive committee approved his resignation on October 23rd and requested the general meeting to ratify it. The resolution was to approve the ratification and to have alternate committee member Pan Baoxiang fill the vacancy. (2) It was previously decided that there would be only seven members of the executive committee. However, according to the law, those who joined the association were very enthusiastic. The number of executive committee members should be increased so that they can gather ideas and work together for the development of the association. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly. The resolution was to hold another general meeting of members at a later date to discuss this further. The general meeting will be convened in three weeks. (3) The current industry regulations of this association have been drafted by the executive and supervisory committee members. If members have any suggestions for additions, deletions, or revisions, please express them as much as possible to achieve perfection. Please decide publicly. The resolution was to distribute the industry regulations to the members for detailed consideration and revision, and to submit them to the association within ten days for compilation. The meeting for members will then discuss it. (4) The industry business of this association has been declining since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. Competition among the industry has led to commercial warfare, and it has often been heard that the operating prices are lower than the budget of the contractor. This situation not only damages the credit of the industry but also leads to suicide. In order to protect the interests of members and restore credit, this association should find ways to improve. Please decide publicly. The resolution was to bring it up for discussion at the next general meeting of members.

<h3>車溝市民　反對建火油池</h3>
<p>Residents of Chegou Oppose the Construction of Oil Tanks</p>
<p>The old Huaxing Wharf warehouse in Donggou Town, Pudong, was originally used for storing goods. Recently, the Meiguang Petroleum Company planned to build oil tanks in the warehouse.

They now plan to petition the municipal government to stop it. Yesterday, they held a discussion on how to proceed in room 603 on the sixth floor of the Oriental Hotel. It is said that they will submit a petition to the authorities to strictly stop it.</p>
<h3>收租員侵款私逃　法院出票通緝</h3>
<p>Rent Collector Embezzles Funds and Flees; Court Issues Warrant for Arrest</p>
<p>Ji Shuhui from Nantong, 27 years old, worked as a rent collector for the Yu Ji Rental Company since October of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. Starting last year, Ji concealed the rent he collected, did not report it, or collected rent from tenants without issuing rent receipts, instead issuing his own receipts in lieu of rent receipts. He embezzled more than 2,000 yuan through these and other methods. Recently, the company discovered this. Ji abandoned his post and fled, and sent a letter to the company admitting to privately using more than 1,800 yuan. Xu Yutian of the Xing Ji Company appointed a lawyer to file a complaint with the court against Ji for embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Because Ji had fled, he did not appear in court when it opened, so the case could not proceed. The plaintiff's lawyer requested the court to approve a public warrant for his arrest, which the court approved. The Xing Ji Company then immediately appointed a lawyer to offer a reward of 100 yuan to publish a warrant for the arrest of Ji Shuhui to be brought to justice for interrogation.</p>

<h3>前偵緝分隊長李筱寳等　誣良爲匪得賄縱逃　已獲案之呂金春等會解警備部審理　應犯之罪條判決後又移送地院研訊</h3>
<p>Former Detective Squad Leader Li Xiaobao and Others Frame Innocent People as Bandits, Take Bribes and Let Them Escape; Lu Jinchun and Others Who Have Been Arrested Will Be Sent to the Garrison Headquarters for Trial; After the Crimes They Should Commit Are Judged, They Will Be Transferred to the District Court for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Li Xiaobao, the former leader of the Ximen squad of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, and his apprentice, detective Jin Yushan, in April of this year, due to Xu Xueqin, Yang Defu, Shi Dachengzi, Xin Faquan, and others robbing the Wei Chen family at No. 957 Tiantong'ankou, Gongxing Road, and the Xiong Jiqing family at No. 3212 Taiyang Temple, Gonghe New Road, and robbing police officers Zhang Rongjun and Yang Shichao of one pistol each, while the case was being investigated by the Police Bureau's Detective Team, Xu Xueqin, because Yang Defu and others suspected him, had a different idea. He entrusted Cui Xiaoguizi to introduce Li Xiaobao to Lu Jinchun, a colleague and foreman of Li Xiaobao. They met at Ximen Paradise. Li Xiaobao agreed to give him forty yuan after solving the case, but Cui Xiaoguizi had to guarantee it. Then the Ximen Branch sent police to Jiangwan to arrest Shi Dachengzi and seized the two pistols he had robbed. Each gave 20 yuan to Lu Jinchun to divide and leave. Yang Defu heard the news and also went to the Ximen squad to plan to avoid investigation. Li Xiaobao also agreed. Because Yang Defu knew that the handyman Liu Weizhen, Xu Helin, and Huang Zhenghong, whom he knew well, went to Maple Bridge to work every day, they had to pass through Dapu Bridge and Hei Qiaotou. He secretly conspired with Li Xiaobao and Lu Jinchun to frame them and replace them as the three criminals in the above cases. On the morning of the 26th of the same month at 7:30, Li Xiaobao ordered Jin Yushan and detective Feng Agen to go to their places with Lu Jinchun and Xu Xueqin separately, and ambush in the bamboo fence. Jin Yushan also ordered Zhu Shaoquan, a teahouse attendant who was unaware of the situation, to transport the two original guns that had been seized to the place and hand them over to Yang Defu. When Liu Weizhen and Xu Helin arrived at the place, Yang Defu stepped forward to Liu Weizhen and pretended to have diarrhea, and asked him to carry the paper bag (the bag containing the pistol) for him. As soon as Liu Weizhen received it, Jin Yushan and others rushed out and shouted to arrest the bandits, and immediately took Liu Weizhen to the squad. Then Xu Helin and Huang Zhenghong were captured. They were tortured with torture and falsely accused of being the principal offenders in the above-mentioned robbery cases and robbing police officers of their pistols. They were sent to the Public Security Bureau. The real criminals, Yang Defu and Shi Dachengzi, were introduced by Lu Jinchun in a letter. Li Xiaobao gave them travel expenses and guaranteed to send them on the train, allowing them to escape to Changzhou Xinda Huizi and Chen Jiaen's homes to take temporary refuge. The principal offender, Xu Xueqin, on the afternoon of May 11th at 2:00, asked Li Xiaobao to escort him back to Funing, his hometown. Unexpectedly, detective Chen Enrong found out and secretly reported it to Liang Yu, the leader of the first squad of the detective team, who sent police to intercept Xu Xueqin and Cui Xiaoguizi. Yang Defu, who was using the pseudonym Chen Junsheng in Changzhou, was corresponding with Li Xiaobao. Liang Yu also found the letter and immediately requested the Wujin County Government to assist in arresting Shi Dachengzi, Chen Jiaen, and Zhang Dahuizi and bringing them to Shanghai. When searching Shi Dachengzi, they found the mailing address to Yang Defu, and went to arrest and bring the rich man Xin Kunshan, and the bandits Xin Faquan, Yang Defu, Yang Futang, etc. to the bureau. Xiaobao, Jin Yushan, Ma Agen, and others fled upon hearing the news. Lu Jinchun was arrested. Director Cai Jinjun believed that the detective squad leader and others were colluding with bandits and causing harm, taking bribes and letting them escape, and framing innocent people to death. All kinds of crimes should be punished by military law. Therefore, he offered a reward for the arrest of Li Xiaobao, Jin Yushan, and others who were at large. Lu Jinchun and a group of bandits who had been arrested were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for punishment. After the Military Law Office investigated and inquired, they determined the crimes that each person should commit and sent the criminals to the local court for punishment according to criminal law. After Zhao, the prosecutor, investigated and determined the facts, he asked for punishment for all the criminals in the case and those who were at large and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened a court for inquiry. Lu Jinchun hired Song Yuntao, a former staff member of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau, as his lawyer to defend him in court, saying that he was framed by his colleagues. The judge, seeing that the facts and evidence were all there, in order to convince him, summoned Liang Ren to court for further questioning.</p>

<h3>因軍火被控人　米登無罪</h3>
<p>Italian Concession Court's Trial Results in Acquittal for Mideng on Arms Charges</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, the Italian Mideng, who was arrested on Peng Road with an alien of unknown nationality, Alliot, was accused of illegally possessing arms and attempting to sell them. Recently, Judge Rabbex of the Italian Concession Court continued the trial. Because the evidence presented by the police was insufficient, he was acquitted and released. It is reported that on that day, the police searched the two men and found ten pistols and 2,000 rounds of ammunition. Later, they found 22 pistols and 5,000 rounds of ammunition in the Italian's residence. During the court session a few days ago, the defendant Mideng confessed that he did not want to sell these pistols himself. The guns were brought to his room by an Englishman, Ferguson, and a German, Rosenberg. He did not know it at first, but then he had to sell them to get rid of the burden. Unexpectedly, Ferguson secretly reported it to the police, and a Chinese detective disguised himself as a buyer to entrap him. Then, a Swedish witness, Meror, testified that he had previously purchased a pistol from Ferguson, and the serial number was the same as the guns found by the police at Aliote and Mideng. Then Aliote testified that he had acted as a tongue for Mideng, Ferguson, and the Chinese detective who was disguised as a buyer on November 2nd. At 5:30 p.m. that afternoon, Mideng went to his residence and showed him and Ferguson two pistols, and said that he could supply 30 of the same guns. That night, the three gathered in a Japanese restaurant on Peng Road to meet with the Chinese detective. Mideng then claimed that he had not said a word during the conversation. He was innocent of selling arms to the Chinese. Aliote said that the price was agreed at 92 yuan per gun, and he would get a commission of two yuan. Mideng was furious when he heard this and accused Aliote of being ungrateful. Because Aliote first claimed to be an American citizen, the American Consulate did not recognize him, so he was tried by the First Special District Court. Mideng was also summoned to court this week and defended Aliote, saying that Aliote was only a tongue and had nothing to do with the case. Mideng also recounted in court a few days ago how he had helped Aliote dispose of narcotics and how he had helped him when Aliote was imprisoned in the Wald Road Prison for debt. Aliote replied that he had to testify truthfully and could not consider the private favors mentioned by Mideng. After all the witnesses testified, Dr. Albini, the lawyer for the defendant Mideng, said that based on the circumstances of the entire case, Aliote was framed under the guidance of the police. This can be proved by Ferguson's admission that he secretly reported it to the police. After the speech, the judge acquitted the defendant and released him.</p>

<h3>逆子毆傷父母　解送公安總局訊辦</h3>
<p>Filial Son Beats Parents, Sent to the Public Security Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>Yao Zifu from Zhenjiang, 54 years old, set up a pot stall at No. 1 Yong'anfang, Old Jiaochang, in the Yuyuan Garden in the county town. His son, Yao Fuqing, 24 years old, who is married, does not engage in proper business and steals his father's property for personal use. His father has sent him to the police station twice for punishment, and once to the vagrant training center. He was sentenced to six months in prison for filial disobedience by the court. However, his son accused his father of adultery, which caused deep resentment. He was driven out by his father and lived separately at No. 72 Shen Xiangge Road. Recently, Fuqing sneaked into his father's house and stole a contract worth more than 1,000 yuan, pawned it, and spent it lavishly, which caused another dispute. His father asked his son to return the contract before he would stop. Unexpectedly, the son's beastly nature was established, and he had no respect for his parents. He beat his father fiercely, and his mother helped his father. The son then held an axe and slashed wildly, causing minor injuries to the old couple. They were taken to the police station in the county town. Before the beating, they had been to the police station twisting each other within just one day, because it was a minor family matter, they were reconciled and released.

<h3>Woman Sentenced to Seven Years for Selling Heroin Illegally</h3>
<p>Yin Ying, a woman from Jiangwan, has recently been secretly selling the drug heroin for profit in the rear building of No. 11, Lane 31, Huaji Road. Guo Ruiquan, a Chinese detective from Huishan Patrol Room, learned of this and sent an informant to purchase it, which proved to be true. The day before yesterday, he and a Western detective rushed to the address at 11:30 a.m. and arrested Yin Ying. In the drawer of the table, in the cigarette lighter box, a large bag of heroin and 43 small bags were seized. Yin Ying and the items were taken to the patrol room. The next morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case and said that Yin Ying had stated in the patrol room that the drugs had been purchased from a certain place in the French Concession.

<h3>Fire on Dongchang Road</h3>
<p>At 9:45 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out suddenly at the Haixing Handicraft Factory at No. 29, Pudongli, Dongchang Road, Pudong. The factory specializes in making various rosin ornaments, so the fire spread quickly. The Pudong District Fire Brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire. Because there was no water nearby, they urgently connected long hoses and passed them across the surface of Dongchang Road to collect water from the well of the Pudong Telephone Bureau, which finally extinguished the fire. One building of the handicraft factory was completely burned down. When the fire was being put out, a public bus of a certain number traveling between Dongchang Road and Yangjing ignored the advice of the firefighters and ran over the hose, damaging it and blocking the water supply, which aroused the anger of the firefighters. The public bus was temporarily suspended. The Pudong Branch mediated the situation. After the fire was extinguished, the firefighters packed up the hoses, and the bus was able to operate normally.</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Cooperation in the Candle Industry for Rectification</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Candle Industry Association and the Candle Industry Workers' Union, in view of the increasingly sluggish business in recent years and the tendency for both labor and management members to suffer losses, although partly due to the influence of the market, also consider the competition of price cuts and gifts to be a major reason. Now, in order to stabilize the lives of members, the two associations have signed a cooperative mutual assistance agreement to make effective corrections. The agreement was submitted to the Social Bureau last month and approved. On the 10th of this month, the association held a joint meeting to discuss thorough rectification measures. According to the agreement, detailed rules were formulated to proceed with the implementation. The outline is as follows: (1) For any member of the industry in this city who violates industry regulations, enters private or inferior goods, privately sets prices for disorderly gifts, or imitates others, or whose business operations do not notify the association, after ineffective persuasion, the association may impose a fine of more than 50 yuan and less than 300 yuan, or notify the labor union to order the serving members to stop work to speed up efficiency, while still handling it according to law. (2) For any shop or workshop without a retail store that is not subject to the restrictions of the industry regulations and sells in bulk at low prices, the labor union may be notified to use the aforementioned emergency measures to deal with it in the same way, or if they still do not stop working, the labor union may send personnel to deposit important equipment in the association, to be returned after compliance. (3) For any cigarette paper shop or other business that sells candles and disrupts prices and regulations, the wholesale industry may be held accountable and the punishment method is the same as above. (4) Any new industry in this city must be approved by the industry association and issued a license before it can be opened. Those who do not comply with this regulation, the workers who open the industry will be stopped from working, and those who do not open the industry will be stopped from supplying goods by the trading stores, and all members of the association and the labor union will be notified that they must not accept transactions or work from violators. The steps for determining reward reporting methods and mutually promoting membership and payment of fees are also determined. In addition to excerpting the full text and posting it in the newspaper for notification, the association has also dispatched personnel to investigate on a daily basis in order to achieve the goal of labor-management coexistence and common prosperity.</p>

<h3>General Situation of Changes in Shanghai Industry and Commerce in July and August This Year (Continued) (Thirty-eighth of the General Situation of Shanghai Industry and Commerce) Edited by China Credit</h3>
<p>3. Liquidation of Guotai Commercial Savings Bank—The bank was founded by people in the money industry, such as Qian Jiewu, Zheng Bingquan, and Xu Kecheng, with a total capital of 1 million yuan in national currency. It was organized as a joint-stock limited company. In October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the founding meeting was convened, and Wang Boyuan was selected as chairman of the board and Zheng Bingquan as general manager. After registration with the Ministry of Finance, it opened in February of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, with savings and trust departments. Its usual operations were known to be stable. Recently, due to the impact of the economic downturn, deposits have gradually decreased. Since the currency system reform last winter and the issuance of unified public bonds this spring, its business has been greatly affected. At the same time, many loans have been frozen, and real estate investments cannot be circulated, so its business is declining. Recently, it has been affected by a certain Zizhuang, and almost all deposits in the savings department have been withdrawn. The board of directors, in view of the difficult future, convened an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on the 9th of this month, but because the number of attendees was insufficient, only a provisional resolution to liquidate was passed, and business was suspended from that day. On the 30th, a shareholders' meeting was held again, and liquidation was formally approved.</p>
<p>4. Liquidation of Yifeng Money Shop—The shop opened in May of this year with a capital of 10,000 yuan, and Mr. Zhao Liting was appointed as manager. Less than two months after opening, Mr. Zhao left for no reason, and the shop was liquidated. It is heard that although the capital was said to be 10,000 yuan, only 1,500 yuan was actually collected. Therefore, the creditors have filed lawsuits for fraud, which have not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>5. Liquidation of Guangxing Silver Company—The predecessor of the company was Guangxin Silver Company. Due to excessive losses, it declared bankruptcy in the 24th year. The current company was reorganized by Manager Zhang Zuoheng and opened in November of the 24th year with a capital of 90,000 yuan in national currency. It was organized as a partnership, with Zhang himself serving as manager, specializing in Shanghai-Guangdong remittances and money exchange. The business was relatively stable. Recently, due to the economic downturn and the Shanghai-Guangdong exchange rate plummeting due to the Two Guangdong Incident, it was unable to maintain operations due to tight turnover.</p>

<h3>Seeking the Revival of the Cotton Industry Amidst the Turning Point in Yarn Sales</h3>
<p>— Wang Qinglin</p>
<p>Our country's cotton textile industry, on the one hand, is limited by its own capital, and on the other hand, is subject to the aggressive encroachment of foreign yarn factories in the country, resulting in difficult support and insufficient development. Especially in recent years, the decline of rural areas and the scourge of communist bandits have further narrowed yarn sales. Therefore, the crisis in the industry is increasing day by day. Last year, many yarn factories were sold or declared liquidation. However, the serious situation of the yarn industry did not improve in the first half of this year. The most important thing is that the Yuyuan, Huaxin, and Baocheng factories in Tianjin were acquired by Japanese companies such as Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd. and Yuda. This is indeed a huge loss to our national industry. Furthermore, according to the statistics of the yarn industry in recent years, at the end of the 24th year, there were 93 Chinese-owned factories nationwide, with a total of 2,776,998 yarn spindles, 25,354 thread spindles, and 24,861 looms. The number of yarn spindles being added was 72,236, thread spindles 19,104, and looms 638. Compared with the previous year, yarn spindles seemed to increase by 36,223, thread spindles by 12,522, and looms by 2,294. Judging from these equipment figures, it seems to be somewhat gratifying. However, in reality, only 12 factories suspended operations in the previous year, while as many as 24 factories completely suspended operations last year, and as many as 14 factories reduced their work. In the first half of last year, the number of spindles in operation nationwide was 4,809,559, and the number of spindles suspended was 1,344,986, with a suspension rate accounting for 28% of the total spindles. From July to December, the number of spindles in operation was 4,952,826, and the number of spindles suspended was 1,360,273, accounting for 27.4% of the total spindles. However, although the number of spindles in operation in the first half of this year was 5,010,039, the number of spindles suspended was as high as 1,555,014, accounting for 31% of the spindles in operation. Therefore, the situation of the yarn industry in the first half of this year has indeed increased rather than decreased.</p>
<p>Looking back at the 50 foreign-owned yarn factories nationwide, there are a total of 2,245,399 yarn spindles, which has reached 81% of the Chinese-owned yarn factories (of which American-owned factories have 261,148 spindles, accounting for 11% of the total foreign-owned spindles, and Japanese-owned factories have 1,984,251 spindles, accounting for 80%). Foreign-owned thread spindles number 149,066, reaching 225% of the Chinese-owned thread spindles, more by 1.25 times. There are 27,148 looms, reaching 109% of the Chinese-owned looms. Moreover, in the seven factories in Tianjin this year, Japanese companies have occupied five, with a total of 187,920 spindles, accounting for 81.2% of the total spindles in the Tianjin yarn industry, and 7,124 thread spindles, accounting for 73.7% of the thread spindles. In Shanghai, there are also rumors of two factories being acquired. Recently, they have also devoted themselves to the expansion of yarn factories in the Beihua area. Their intention is nothing more than to encompass the yarn industry in North China, and then exert all their strength to sweep away the textile industry of Chinese-owned businesses nationwide, and form a monopoly. Looking ahead and thinking behind, Chinese-owned yarn factories in decline will have an overwhelming sense of thorns in the future!</p>
<p>However, since July of this year, the sluggish situation of yarn sales for several years has suddenly become active. Moreover, the continuous rise in yarn prices has also created a phenomenon seen only in the past ten years. This not only means that the revival of the yarn industry itself is promising, but also that the national economy is showing signs of recovery. The biggest reason is that the domestic banditry has gradually subsided, and with the two harvests in spring and summer this year, the rural economy has become relatively prosperous, and purchasing power has gradually recovered. The need for clothing has not been purchased and prepared for a long time, and there is a particular sense of shortage. Therefore, the sales of cloth in the interior started first. Hence, after the summer, the business of cloth was particularly prosperous, followed by the sales of yarn, which have not declined until now. October was particularly the most prosperous month, with a single day's transaction reaching as high as 10,000 packages. The following are the yarn sales figures for the past two years for comparison:</p>
<p>Month   Year 24 (Units: Packages)   Year 25 (Units: Packages)</p>
<p>January   17,269   19,112</p>
<p>February   19,011   24,189</p>
<p>March   11,312   3,403</p>
<p>April   26,823   19,300</p>
<p>May   15,004   22,738</p>
<p>June   26,863   15,154</p>
<p>July   29,064   19,765</p>
<p>August   21,206   45,056</p>
<p>September   31,194   47,980</p>
<p>October   28,919   35,621 (1st to 20th)</p>
<p>As shown in the above table, except for January and February, which were stimulated by the implementation of the new currency policy at the end of last year, and showed a slight increase compared to the same period in the previous year, the remaining months were lower than the same period in the previous year. After August, actual sales were strong, and gradually increased day by day. August increased by 102.9% compared to the same period last year, September increased by 52%, and the two-ten-day figures for October have increased by a huge 8,702 packages compared to the same month last year. Now that yarn consumption has greatly increased, and on the production side, due to the sluggishness in the first half of the year, and the result of expensive cotton and cheap yarn, not only the yarn factories that have been shut down for a long time in Tianjin, Yunnan, and Shanghai have no way to resume operations, but even those in operation have also tended to reduce their work. Therefore, the quantity of supply has greatly decreased. Based on the principle of uneven supply and demand, the less supply there is, the higher the price will be. To prove the prosperity of sales and the origin of the high prices, the following are the figures for yarn inventory in Shanghai for each month (Units: Packages):</p>
<p>Month   Factory Yarn Inventory   Exchange Yarn Inventory   Total</p>
<p>January   18,864   24,281   103,145</p>
<p>February   68,041   28,061   96,108</p>
<p>March   60,670   21,845   88,515</p>
<p>April   69,582   31,115   100,697</p>
<p>May   78,383   22,755   111,138</p>
<p>June   82,460   31,605   114,065</p>
<p>July   72,183   36,535   108,718</p>
<p>August   58,167   33,345   91,512</p>
<p>September   Not Detailed   22,120</p>
<p>October   Not Detailed   5,485</p>
<p>(Note) The above table is compiled based on the figures published in the Textile Times on a regular basis. Those not published are temporarily absent.</p>
<p>According to the cloth table, although it is not possible to know the total number for the most recent two months, it is possible to know the outline just by looking at the item of yarn inventory in the exchange warehouse. Especially in October, the decrease was the largest, suddenly dropping from more than 20,000 packages to more than 5,000 packages, which shows the prosperity of yarn sales. As a result, yarn prices have also risen sharply, which can be proved by the following table (Standard Golden Rooster, highest, lowest, and average):</p>
<p>Month   Year 24 (Units: Yuan)   Year 25 (Units: Yuan)   Increase (%)</p>
<p>July   165.95   207.50   25</p>
<p>August   172.70   215.52   12</p>
<p>September   170.85   215.05   15</p>
<p>October   176.15   232.00   37</p>
<p>According to the above table, comparing the yarn prices in the four months between the two years, the average percentage increase is more than 20%. However, the current rise in yarn prices is even higher than the standard yarn prices. Taking the first two weeks of October as an example, the difference between the highest and lowest prices of current yarn is 39.5 yuan, while the standard is 36.3 yuan. Looking back to September, the difference between the lowest price in September and the highest price in October is more than 55 yuan, while the standard is only 46 yuan. From this, it can be seen that the rise in yarn prices this time is not caused by speculation. Furthermore, in terms of raw materials for yarn factories, in recent years, cheap yarn and expensive cotton have almost become the norm, and this has gradually evolved to the extreme last year. Moreover, last year's cotton production was also poor. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the difference between yarn and cotton prices has not been able to escape this norm. However, since the beginning of summer, the situation has gradually changed. One lesson is that the sales of yarn have been continuous, and the bottom of the inventory has been thinning day by day. On the one hand, the cotton fields have increased, and the cotton crop has been good, forcing the difference between yarn and cotton prices to shrink. This has continued to evolve, and became more obvious in October. The following is a list of the average prices of standard cotton for the most recent four months in the two years for comparison:</p>
<p>Month   Year 24 (Units: Yuan)   Year 25 (Units: Yuan)   Increase Rate</p>
<p>July   32.50   39.45   17.9</p>
<p>August   25.75   39.10   11.9</p>
<p>September   31.90   39.45   20.3</p>
<p>October   33.50   41.91   15.0</p>
<p>Although the average prices in the two years listed above are higher this year than last year, the increase rate is far less than that of yarn prices. Therefore, it can be asserted that the current operations of the yarn industry are profitable. According to recent news reports, "In terms of the yarn factory stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the old shares of the Japanese Shanghai Yarn Factory were 67 or 8 yuan in early September, and the new shares were 38 or 9 yuan. By mid-October, they soared. On the 21st, the old shares were 89 yuan and the new shares were 50 yuan. The old shares rose by 10%, and the new shares rose by 30%. The British Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory was 8.3 yuan in early September, and reached 10 yuan in October. Transactions were brisk, and the price rose from 10.5 or 6 yuan to 11 yuan on the 19th, a rise of about 20%. Chongxin stocks rose from 18 yuan to 20 yuan. The stocks of Chinese-owned yarn factories have also risen naturally due to good business conditions. However, the stocks of Chinese factories are not openly traded, and there are fewer transactions. The situation of price increases is not easy to investigate." Therefore, the smooth operation of Chinese-owned yarn factories is also within expectations.</p>
<p>Yarn industry is one of the most important of the nation's industries. However, in recent years, it has suffered all sorts of difficulties, and rarely avoids total bankruptcy. This year has a chance of revival. This is not just crucial to the future prosperity of the yarn industry itself, it's also crucial for the future prosperity of our national economy. The reason for the decline of the yarn industry is due to the national socio-economic decline and oppression by foreign merchants, and partly due to the yarn industry's failure to exert efforts in operation. Consider the domestic and foreign yarn factories, and in similar circumstances, over the course of years, there were few Chinese factories were profitable, while the majority failed. Foreign factories, however, were profitable every year, and devoted themselves to increasing production and improving their products, seeking consumer satisfaction. They focused on technical aspects of machine maintenance, while seeking rationalization of management, and therefore, the cost of their products continued to shrink, and profit continued to grow. Business has grown from day to day, so news of increasing the number of spindles and establishing factories is common. In other words, the amount of aggression is increasing, while the crisis facing Chinese yarn factories deepens. Looking at Chinese factories in the past two years, there has been no end to the reports of those being closed or liquidated, so when compared to the gradually expanding number of foreign acquisitions and shutdowns, I fear the disparity is still great. In the past, the yarn factories' situations were extremely difficult, and we couldn't bear to be too demanding, but at this time of revival, I deeply hope that those in the yarn industry will no longer follow old ways, and not seek only personal gain from the current profits. They should take this year's profits and prepare for future renovation of equipment, so the quality of those products can compete with foreign factories, this is one point. When Chinese people start businesses, the biggest problem is the hiring of relatives and the lack of scientific management, and factories that follow this practice will be hard pressed to avoid disaster, resulting in high expenditures and an invisible increase in the factory's burden, and cost of products. From now on, they should carry out substantial reform to alleviate the burden, this is another point. In the future, construction of new factories should be directed inland, as that is a matter of the utmost importance. In recent years, all provinces have been working hard to promote the cotton industry, and wherever they are, they all have cotton production. If one sets up factories locally, not only is it more convenient, but it can be sold locally, substantially reducing costs, while resisting the influx of products from foreign factories. It could also make up for the insufficiency under the oppression of unequal treaties, this is another point. Only, the capital of China's yarn factories has always been weak, far inferior to the abundant capital of foreign factories, so other than what I mentioned, it is necessary to look forward to assistance from the financial authorities, and financial industry has always been about regulating the circulation of industry and commerce, and indirectly helping the prosperity of all sorts of industries, to achieve a common trend of prosperity for the entire economic situation. In other words, the more industry and commerce develops, the more the financial circulation is needed, and at the same time, finances become more frequent and ever more solid. Currently, there are many industries and commerce in our country that depend on the financial sector, and the yarn industry needs it the most. Only, the authorities in our financial sector don't have as much actual investment in the yarn industry as there is speculative buying and selling of cotton and yarn. It seems financial companies are apprehensive about the yarn factories, so they are wary. As yarn factories lack the help of funding, they are ultimately unable to improve, and the yarn industry has become more run down. I deeply hope they embrace "the past can be caught up" and "co-existence and co-prosperity", and from this day forward, make a distinction for our country's yarn industry, to maintain this only national industry, and make up for the annual losses, and the booming sales and high prices of yarn may not be a glimmer of rebirth for our country's yarn industry.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Thoroughly Investigating the Financial Situation of Yarn Factories</h3>
<p>— Shen Ronglin</p>
<p>Most Chinese yarn factories are born deficient. The capital they raise when they start their businesses is not enough for the development of their businesses. Once they encounter difficult times, they are at risk of stagnation. Although the past situation of Chinese yarn factories and the reasons for their fatigue are not limited to this one end, the lack of smooth capital turnover, which prevents them from operating freely and lacks smooth and flexible promotion, is a major shortcoming of Chinese yarn factories. To remedy this shortcoming, we should find ways to thoroughly investigate the assets and liabilities of yarn factories, so that the financial situation of yarn factories can be seen accurately.</p>
<p>The assets of yarn factories are divided into two types: fixed assets and current assets. Machinery, buildings, land, and other items are fixed assets, while cotton yarn, cotton, and materials in stock are current assets. Liabilities are divided into two types: unsecured loans and secured loans. Unsecured loans are very few, and most of them are secured loans. Secured loans are divided into two types: one is secured by fixed assets, and the other is secured by current assets. Fixed assets, due to natural consumption and the results of use, are worn and damaged over time, gradually reducing their value. Therefore, depreciation and valuation issues are important issues for today's reorganization of yarn factory finances. Depreciation is necessary in accounting, and what should be studied is what method should be used to calculate it, so that it is suitable for the practical use of yarn factory depreciation. Regarding this calculation, three elements must be obtained: (1) original cost, (2) number of years of life, and (3) scrap value. Among them, the number of years of life and scrap value are particularly important in the calculation. Valuation is the responsibility of yarn factory economic and technical experts. A reasonable method should be used to calculate the value of its assets, and the current market price should be used to determine how much it is worth, so that creditors can understand the true value of its assets without being burdened, and the balance sheet can have an accurate representation.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been proposed that corporate bonds be circulated in the market together with government bonds, so that frozen capital can be reactivated in the market and increase the chips in the financial market. Yarn factories feel particularly in need. If you want to make the stocks of yarn factories active in the capital market, then rectifying the finances of the yarn factories is a preliminary step in rectifying the credit of the yarn factories. After the financial foundation of the yarn factories is stable, the economic structure and elements of the yarn factories can be understood by the public, and the yarn factory bonds can be freely circulated in the market. If this continues to be lax, it will be enough to shake the entire financial system and affect national tax revenue. The dangers of our country's yarn factories in the past and the turmoil of the entire social economy are still vividly visible. In order to correct the dangers of yarn factories in the past, we should propose a thorough investigation of the real situation of yarn factory finances in order to supervise them. Because yarn factories are important undertakings of the national industry, their capital has reached more than 100 million yuan, and they have extremely important connections with finance, farmers, laborers, and the economy.</p>
<p>After thoroughly investigating the financial situation of yarn factories, fulfilling the accounting legal system is a matter that cannot be delayed. The three items of debt reduction fund, depreciation equalization, and interest reserve fund should be implemented urgently, so that the foundation of the yarn factory can be placed on a secure foundation. If it is healthy itself, the credit of the yarn factory bonds will naturally increase. Once the capital market is free to buy and sell, collecting circulating funds for use is not the same as borrowing foreign capital. However, because the interest is too high, all equipment has to be simplified, and cannot compete with foreign factories. How can the loss be calculated?</p>
<h3>Some Personal Views on Reviving China's Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— Sun Ruling</p>
<p>The textile industry is one of China's major industries. It began in Shanghai and other major cities during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, various countries focused on war preparations, leading to a sharp decline in textile imports. Consequently, China's textile industry experienced a period of vigorous growth. Following the end of World War I, various countries eagerly established factories in China, creating intense competition, with Britain and Japan being the most prominent. According to surveys, Japanese companies established approximately forty yarn mills in China, while British companies established four. Moreover, these foreign factories possessed substantial capital, were backed by their governments, adopted new machinery, increased productivity, and reduced costs. Their refined technology and superior products were unmatched by China. Other factors, such as the constraints of unequal treaties and the inability to fully control tariffs, also contributed to the gradual decline of China's textile industry. Additionally, years of natural disasters and man-made calamities led to rural bankruptcy and a sharp decline in people's purchasing power. Since the spring of this year, China has faced increasingly difficult circumstances due to the impact of armed smuggling in North China. Although a few manufacturers attempted to revitalize the industry, their appeals went unheard, forcing them to shut down or sell to foreigners. These circumstances represent not only a significant loss for China's industry but also a harbinger of economic collapse. As China promotes economic revitalization, this major industry must not be overlooked. I will now briefly outline my humble views on reviving the textile industry:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Government's Role—Historically, all advanced countries have had industrial policies, providing meticulous nurturing and protection for their industries. For example, when factories established by various countries in China faced capital shortages or sluggish sales, their governments exerted great effort to provide substantial financial support and devise strategies to promote sales. In recent years, China has also been striving to promote economic construction, but continuous internal warfare has depleted the national treasury, and numerous issues require attention. The government already feels the inadequacy of its financial resources. Providing cash subsidies to factories may be difficult in practice. However, the textile industry is a fundamental industry in China and has a significant impact on the economic lives of the Chinese people. How can it be allowed to decline naturally without any attempt at remediation? Since the government authorities lack the strength for practical assistance, they should address the reduction of taxes, the increase of import tariffs on foreign goods, and the provision of credit loans to the extent possible, using political power to help the development of the textile industry. This will be discussed in detail below.</p>
<p>(1) Reduction of Taxes—China's tax system includes unified taxes and local business taxes, resulting in a heavy burden and increased costs. Furthermore, the export of goods and the procurement of raw materials depend on the development of transportation and the convenience of transport. Except for the coastal provinces, China's inland transportation infrastructure is underdeveloped. Inconvenient transportation hinders the penetration of goods into the interior. While recent highway construction has been relatively extensive, it is only suitable for light transport and not for freight. In contrast, foreign goods can be freely circulated after paying a single import duty at customs, without the need for additional taxes. The lighter burden broadens the market. Therefore, in order to rescue the struggling textile industry, the government should prioritize reducing unified taxes and abolishing all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies.</p>
<p>(2) Increase Import Tariffs on Foreign Goods—All countries in the world adopt protective policies for their developed industries and businesses, raising import tariffs to avoid pressure from similar foreign goods. Due to China's lack of full tariff autonomy, foreign goods are imported in large quantities and dumped on the market, leading to the decline of domestic products. Therefore, to promote the development of domestic industries, it is essential to implement protective policies and raise import tariffs.</p>
<p>(3) Implement Credit Loans—Credit loans have been practiced in China for a long time. However, since the financial contraction, credit loans have decreased significantly. Only substantial collateral can inspire confidence. A lack of financial flexibility hinders the development of industries and businesses. In the current global economic downturn, selling goods is not easy. Small-scale factories may face economic hardship due to sluggish sales, potentially leading to shutdowns, layoffs, or even bankruptcy. The losses for the factories are significant. If government agencies, to the extent possible, enable state-owned banks to implement credit loans, factories can continue operating, and workers will not suffer from unemployment.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Textile Industry Itself—(1) Labor-Management Cooperation—Any organization or country must have a well-organized internal structure and a unified sense of purpose to resist external pressures. A country with weak unity and a disorganized structure is vulnerable to invasion by other nations. The same applies to the textile industry. Therefore, both labor and management should be aware of the current crisis facing China's textile industry. Management should strive to improve workers' living standards, improve factory conditions, promote wholesome entertainment, and enhance workers' knowledge. Labor should work harder and make full use of their inherent abilities to increase production rapidly. Labor unrest can hinder the development of the textile industry.</p>
<p>(2) Technical Improvement—China's textile industry lags far behind in terms of technology. This is mainly due to the level of training and differences in training methods compared to other countries. Chinese workers working in foreign factories often achieve twice the efficiency of those working in domestic factories. When workers possess superior skills, the finished products are also superior, and sales can be expanded. Therefore, technical improvement is a major factor in the revitalization of the textile industry. The first step should be to strictly select domestic experts with specialized knowledge and experience to serve as instructors to train general workers. The second step should be to promote them to appropriate positions based on their work efficiency, ensuring that everyone can maximize their talents and resources. Establish reward and punishment systems to motivate workers to improve. These are essential conditions for improving technology.</p>
<p>(3) Employ Specialized Management Talent—Management talent occupies a significant position in factories. They should have a correct understanding of basic industrial knowledge and be rich in experience. To avoid waste of resources, those responsible for labor-management relations should pay close attention to this. One common problem in China's industries and businesses is the lack of basic knowledge. Regardless of the size of the position, the employed staff are often relatives or acquaintances. As they lack basic knowledge, they cannot perform their duties effectively. The waste of resources and the alienation between labor and management can hinder the development of the textile industry. Therefore, to revive the textile industry, the selection of management personnel should adopt a public examination system to employ specialized talent as much as possible, strengthening the factory's organizational structure and avoiding the waste of resources.</p>
<p>(4) Adopt New Machinery—Machinery is essential for production. Modern textile machinery has made significant advancements and cannot be compared to the old machinery of the 19th century. It not only produces goods quickly but also ensures superior quality. However, most of the machinery used in China is still from the 19th century, resulting in slower production and inferior quality. This makes it impossible to compete with foreign goods in the market. Therefore, for the future of the textile industry, it is essential to quickly purchase new machinery.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Individual's Role—Individuals should understand the current crisis facing China's textile industry and strive to support and purchase domestic textiles. They should correct any unnecessary speculation and activities that hinder the progress of the textile industry, redirecting them to benefit the industry. Recently, many businessmen have speculated in government bonds, bid premiums, and real estate, while avoiding investment in productive industries. For the sake of China's future, we should eliminate all selfish interests and eagerly invest in productive industries. This will also contribute to the revival of China's textile industry.</p>
<p>All the above cannot be achieved by a single force. It requires the united efforts and hard work of the entire nation to achieve a smooth and successful revitalization.</p>
<h3>Textual Research on China's Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>— Chen Weifan</p>
<p>The origin of cooperation in China can be traced back to the Zhou Dynasty, with various forms of cooperative societies already in existence. This proves that the occurrence of cooperation in ancient China was not later than that in European countries. Using today's classification of cooperation, this article provides examples to demonstrate the existing cooperation in ancient China, so as to provide reference for researchers of cooperation.</p>
<p>(1) Production Cooperation - The Zhou Dynasty implemented the well-field system, dividing land into 900 mu, cultivated jointly by eight families, with 100 mu per family. This system is quite similar to the cooperative communal villages advocated by Owen. Owen's concept was to "divide a country into several thousand acres, with each thousand acres forming an area, inhabited by about 1,200 people, with a central organization including public kitchens, dining halls, schools, libraries, and lecture halls; in this communal society, each member should be like a family, living in harmony and mutual love, without disputes, each member engaging in equal work, sharing equal profits." Owen's idea of communal villages not only failed to be realized at the time, but has not succeeded even today. Comparing it with the well-field system implemented in China during the Zhou Dynasty, it can be seen that the organization of this production cooperative method is far superior to cooperative facts in the West.</p>
<p>(2) Credit Cooperation - China's money clubs are very popular, and most of the members are relatives and friends, gathering credit to share wealth and meet urgent needs. Even foreigners pay close attention to China's money club system, praising it as a law that can be emulated. There are two theories about the origin of money clubs: one is that it was founded by Pang Gong in the Later Han Dynasty, and the other is that it was inherited from the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove in the Jin Dynasty. These two theories can only be used as after-dinner conversation and are not credible. However, the name Xin'an Club in Xin'an began in the Sui Dynasty. Based on this reasoning, the origin of money clubs should be in the Tang Dynasty. The names and organizational forms of various systems are described below:</p>
<p>(A) Money Club - This organization is the most common in China, but it is not as common in villages as in towns, because farmers have less cash income on a regular basis, while people in towns are mostly engaged in industry and commerce, with more active income, so there are more money clubs. The organization of the money club is initiated by the person who needs it most, based on his usual credit and personality, and the number of members varies, depending on his needs and ability. There are many types of money clubs, classified by the number of people, such as Three Provinces Club, Five Sages Club, Seven Sages Club, Eight Immortals Club, Ten Perfections Club, etc.; classified by the nature of the club, such as Rocking Club, Spreading Club, Bidding Club, etc.; classified by the period of the club, such as Annual Club, Quarterly Club, Semimonthly Club, Decadal Club, etc.</p>
<p>(B) Egg Club - This organization is more common in northern China and has the meaning of savings. Most of the members are poor farmers in rural areas, and the club period starts from June to March of the following year. The number of members is not fixed, and each person pays one or more eggs per day, collected by the clerk elected by the members. In March of the following year, when the harvest is not yet ripe, that is, when poor employees are living hard, they will exchange the eggs for food or sell them for money to maintain their lives or prepare for the harvest, so as to avoid the predicament of having no one to turn to.</p>
<p>(C) Gold Accumulation Club - This organization is similar to the egg club. The method is that members pay five dou, one shi, or three shi of grain at the time of harvest, and elect two or three people to manage the collection of affairs, and their qualifications must be based on the faith of the members.</p>
<p>(D) Meat Club - This organization is more common in the south. The farmers who initiate it raise a certain number of pigs and lead a certain number of members, and each person pays two or three cents a month from January to December. At the end of the year, the principal and interest are calculated, and a certain number of kilograms of meat are purchased according to the amount of money, and the pork is distributed for the New Year's feast, to comfort the year's hard work.</p>
<p>(E) Wife Club - The purpose of this club is to marry a wife, and it is more common in the south. For farmers without property, marriage is considered a major difficulty, because everything from betrothal to gift-giving requires a lot of money, so this type of organization came into being. The organization method is that the first club, that is, the man who gets married for the first time, gathers nine men who are preparing to get married in the future, aged from sixteen or seventeen to twenty-five or six, with each person differing by one year, and the term is ten years, and each person has a membership fee for marriage every year. One member gets married every year. The order of marriage is based on age. After ten years, all members are married; the members who married earlier have also had children. Every year on the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar, each member takes his wife, in pairs, to a banquet, raising their glasses to celebrate the reunion!</p>
<p>(3) Storage Cooperation - In ancient China, the Han Dynasty had a flat warehouse, the Sui Dynasty had a righteous warehouse, and the Song Dynasty had a community warehouse, which were originally used to store grain in preparation for famine years. Although these warehouses were stored in the government, the grain stored was taken from the people and will also be distributed to the people in the future, which is quite similar to storage cooperation.</p>
<p>(4) Consumer Cooperation - In ancient China, there was no currency, but the exchange of goods, that is, to exchange what they have for what they don't have, which is like the prototype of consumer cooperation. In addition, farmers often gather neighbors, relatives and friends during the New Year's holidays to jointly sell goods for distribution, such as killing pigs and buying oil, salt, cloth, and other facts, which is very similar to distribution cooperation.</p>
<p>(5) Insurance Cooperation - Such as Longevity Club, Old People's Club, Coffin Club, Hundred Years Club, etc., each province has this kind of organization, which is similar in nature to life insurance cooperation, the only difference is that this kind of cooperation is a dead cooperation, not a living cooperation, and this kind of cooperation is not the insurance cooperation promoted today.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned cooperative enterprises in ancient China, due to the lack of perfect organization and good system, failed to be promoted and developed, which is a pity!</p>

<h3>Securities: Major Investors Exert Efforts to Drive Up Prices; Government Bonds Hit New Highs Last Week</h3>
<p>From November 9th to 14th last week, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange witnessed a prosperous market with prices rising to new peaks. Four types of bonds reached an unprecedented high of 71.55 yuan. Amidst a seemingly stable but actually tight situation, this abnormal development was due to the manipulation of prices by organized bullish companies, who fabricated favorable rumors. Small investors followed suit, pushing prices skyward. Once most people became optimistic, speculators subtly entered and exited the market to confuse the public.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, rumors of a military action in Eastern Liaoning spread on Monday, leading major investors to sell, causing a slight dip of about 0.1-0.2 yuan. However, No. 5 began buying. On Tuesday, Northern investors bought while No. 5 continued to absorb, and No. 4 continued to sell, pushing prices back up by 0.3-0.5 yuan. On Wednesday, due to the consistent buying by No. 5 and others, short sellers were threatened and covered their positions, and small investors eagerly absorbed, No. 4, after selling for three consecutive days, slightly shifted direction. Prices were vigorously pushed up by multiple parties, surging by 0.7-0.8 yuan to as much as 1.35 yuan. The market was closed on Thursday for the anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen. On Friday, bullish parties pushed up prices with maximum fervor. While No. 5 continued to buy unabated, No. 4 also shifted from short to long positions. Major investors mostly bought, and favorable rumors were rampant. Prices rose further by several cents to over 1 yuan, increasing for three consecutive days. Four types of bonds reached unprecedented highs. On Saturday, major investors gradually emerged, and the bullish front began to collapse, gradually weakening the market and falling by 0.1-0.2 yuan. However, forcefully pushing up prices is unsustainable in an unfavorable environment.</p>
<p>As a result of the week's trading, prices rose by 1.89-2.2 yuan. The total trading volume reached 60,735,000 yuan. A comparative table of the price increases and decreases is shown below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Global Cotton Production Increases; American Cotton Industry Adopts Cautious Stance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices rising by 5-8 points for each month. Early in the morning, news from Liverpool was positive, domestic consumption increased, and traders and foreign merchants bought, resulting in a firm upward trend. Subsequently, due to cotton farmers selling short and bullish parties closing positions, there was a temporary correction. Later, due to buying by non-industry parties, prices rose again. Traders, seeing the increase in global cotton production and the government's uncertain policies, adopted a cautious stance. Spot cotton was firm, and fabric sales were about three times the production volume. The market closed steadily. Spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices ranged from unchanged to up 3 points. British spot cotton rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 6-7 points. Indian cotton rose due to reports of rain damage in cotton-growing areas. European exporters bought, while speculators sold Pargo cotton because the Gorakhpur region received beneficial rain. Ormel Head... The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 14th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening prediction for the 16th was: Lakshia at 217 rupees, down 0.25 rupees; Omar at 198.5 rupees, the same as the previous day; Pargo at 158 rupees, down 0.25 rupees.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rainfall in Central India; Indian Cotton Production Not Expected to Decrease</h3>
<p>Last week, the American cotton government report was favorable to sellers. Here, the heavy rainfall in Central India and the Kolhapur region did not have a significant impact. The new cotton harvest began early, and most of it had already been collected before the heavy rainfall, so there was no reduction in production, except for possible damage to the cotton quality. Japan was very active, while the mainland's demand was poor. However, Lancashire inquired frequently.</p>
<h3>Food: Thin Rice and New Japonica Rice Remain Soft</h3>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty boats arrived from various routes along the river. The market was generally quiet, and new Japonica rice was soft in the evening. Thin rice prices fell slightly by 0.03-0.04 yuan. Early rice was slightly weak, and Yinbian Yuan and Dao Xiao Liang He were moderately active. Yangbu Jian went well, showing a good shape. The prices of other rice varieties remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty boats arrived from various sources, with a total of over 9,000 shi of goods. Sales in this street were normal. Baozi did not see any reserve, due to a lack of rotation. The Tianjin, Qingyan, and other groups only handled about 2,000 bags of thin rice. Thick and thin japonica rice, as well as Duyang Jian, Yinbian Yuan, and other varieties, were all fixed, with no significant changes.</p>
<h3>Grain Market: The Price of Old Green Sugar Seems Difficult to Fall Further</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat and soft. The guild marked prices, such as those for the 24th coarse sand white spot and re-export goods, were unchanged. The prices of other varieties, such as the Dongbai 489, remained unchanged. The price of the Benchang Mianbai Jinxin brand was 20.5 yuan, and the prices of the 345 brands were reduced accordingly. No new sugar was opened. According to Shantou, the stock of Chao sugar is low, and the price of green sugarcane is difficult to loosen due to the drought. Moreover, Quxi has purchased a large quantity for use as raw materials for white sugar. Therefore, the cost of new green sugar in the future will inevitably be high. The old goods have also been fixed, and the stock in this store is said to be limited, most of which are owned by the industry. If there is a change in the situation, there is hope for a rebound in the future.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: South Gorgon Fruit Slightly Rebounds</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the low supply of Xinghua gorgon fruit, the market is not strong, even though the price of South Tang gorgon fruit has slightly increased. The lowest price on the two boards was 43 yuan, and the current market price is 45-46 yuan. Some hoarding households have absorbed some, but the volume is not large. The sales of Chi gorgon fruit are also low, with retail prices at 18-19 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sexual Performance Issues on the Wedding Night</h3>
<p>Although Enamored, a Lack of Sexual Ability in Couples Will Result in Sleeping Apart. Promoting Healthy Gonads is the Necessary Preparation for Newlyweds.</p>
<p>Sound sexual performance is the cornerstone of maintaining spousal love. Only a fulfilling sex life can allow a man and a woman to both feel that they are a part of each other, melting two whole hearts into one, intimate and without any gaps, without any shortcomings. The result of sexual performance issues is the opposite. It can transform sweet love into cold hatred.</p>
<p>A healthy woman, holding a fervent and passionate heart, encounters a man who is underdeveloped, impotent and premature, and immediately falls into an abyss of disappointment. At this moment, how severe will the hatred and regret in her heart be? Under the same circumstances, there are also strong men who are enthusiastic and exuberant, but the woman they meet suffers from sexual anesthesia and cannot resonate with them, and disappointed love cools down.</p>
<p>This is by no means the feeling of someone only focused on carnal desire, but a shared feeling of the general public. A fulfilling sex life is something everyone should enjoy.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much they love each other before marriage, or how many vows they make, once they discover defects in each other's sexual performance, they will naturally sleep apart and their feelings will cool down.</p>
<p>In order to relieve future pain and pursue lifelong happiness, couples must carefully test their sexual performance before the wedding night, and if there are defects, they should be cured immediately.</p>
<p>Why are men underdeveloped, impotent, and premature? This is always because they indulge in the bad habit of masturbation in their early years. If you do not destroy it yourself, the gonads will develop well. Masturbators should remember: your rash actions will hinder the local development and make it short and small; those who ejaculate due to masturbation should know that the seminal gate has been widened, and premature ejaculation will inevitably occur, and after weakness, impotence will follow. At this time, you should quickly take "Hemit's Jing-Consolidating Pills" to treat nocturnal emission; then take a large amount of the gonadotropin preparation "Reproduction Element," and impotence and premature ejaculation can be cured, and local development can also be restored to perfection. These two medicines will provide you with abundant sexual power to win the woman's heart.</p>
<p>The reasons why women suffer from sexual anesthesia are roughly similar to those of men. Many girls often play with their genitals from an early age, developing the bad habit of masturbation. Over time, the local sensation becomes numb, the sex nerves are also damaged, and it also leads to menstrual disorders and excessive leucorrhea. At this time, you should quickly take the female gonadotropin preparation "Female Reproduction Element," which can be cured, and can also make the development better, the body healthier, and the breasts taller, which can increase love even more. For leucorrhea, "Leucorrhea-Curing Elixir" can be used as a suppository.</p>
<p>If both men and women suffer from gonorrhea, it is also enough to hinder sexual performance, and the combination of carotenoids and bactericide "Anti-Gonorrhea" can be taken to cure it completely.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: "Reproduction Element" and "Hemit's Jing-Consolidating Pills" are both packed in iron boxes, do not mistakenly purchase counterfeit drugs packed in paper boxes and bottles.)</p>
<p>Therapeutic Guidance</p>
<h3>What Self-Treating Gonorrhea Patients Need to Know</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Society is full of sexual temptations, and there are traps of depravity everywhere, especially in big cities, where there are countless places for people to vent their desires. It is actually not blameworthy for young people with unstable blood to occasionally fall and become infected with gonorrhea. However, most people regard this as a disreputable disease and dare not publicize it, resorting to miscellaneous medicines on the market, lingering without healing, and turning into chronic gonorrhea, which can also induce orchitis, arthritis, seminal vesiculitis, and other diseases, with endless and unmanageable consequences.</p>
<p>Therefore, the correct and reliable self-treatment method is indeed a compass for those who have lost their way. Self-treatment is of course convenient to use oral preparations, and there are many popular oral preparations, so patients must know how to choose.</p>
<p>Excellent oral preparations must have two major advantages: one is that the efficacy is indeed strong, and the other is that there are absolutely no side effects.</p>
<p>Inferior oral preparations can often achieve temporary superficial effects and lead to chronic gonorrhea, and can also often cause various abuses, causing sexual nerves to be hindered. At present, medical professionals unanimously believe that there are no such abuses, and the oral preparation that can completely cure all gonorrhea is the combination of carotenoids and bactericide "Anti-Gonorrhea."</p>
<p>"Anti-Gonorrhea" was invented by Dr. Jeterson, a German medical scientist, and can indeed penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria. After the drug penetrates deep into the urethra, it will kill all the gonococci and completely cure all complications, increasing the patient's anti-toxic ability. However, female patients often have severe leucorrhea at the same time, so "Leucorrhea-Curing Elixir" should be used externally to clean the cavity.</p>
<p>In short, gonorrhea is extremely toxic, so you must be careful when choosing a medicine. I have used "Anti-Gonorrhea" to cure thousands of people, whether new or old, and the results have been satisfactory.</p>
<p>Common Sense About Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>What Makes Quitting Smoking Difficult?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Mentioning quitting smoking, most smokers consider it an extremely difficult task and are not very willing to try. At the same time, smokers who have already started to quit often give up halfway, picking up the opium pipe again, resigned to a life of opium addiction. This common fact indicates the difficulty of quitting smoking. But where exactly does this difficulty lie? Are there any good solutions?</p>
<p>This difficulty is nothing more than the fact that quitting smoking usually requires enduring some pain. Opium originally has a powerful anesthetic effect, and with daily consumption, the anesthetic force gradually invades the body. The tissues of a poisoned person are like someone who is drunk, staggering and unable to move freely and regularly without the support of opium. At this point, the relationship between opium and the smoker is somewhat like a blind man's cane. Without the cane, the blind man will inevitably stumble and fall, ending up with a swollen face and a broken head; similarly, when smokers are separated from opium, their entire body tissues will inevitably experience stagnation of function, lack of energy, tears and mucus flowing, overall weakness, loss of appetite, and unbearable pain.</p>
<p>To relieve this pain and enable safe quitting, we should regard the smoker's entire body tissues as a group of drunkards, giving them sobering medicine to help them wake up, so they can act regularly without the support of opium. Gonadal hormone preparations like "Shengzhi Su" can fulfill the mission of this sobering medicine. It can restore the vitality of organs anesthetized by opium, increase the quitter's health, and naturally boost their energy, making it unnecessary to rely on opium for stimulation to maintain survival. This method of fundamentally solving opium addiction is called the "Nourishing Quitting Method," characterized by its ability to enable people to quit naturally without realizing it.</p>
<p>The patient, Gu Renkun, 37 years old, smoked for five years and felt deeply inconvenienced. However, due to his weak body, he feared he could not endure the pain of quitting, so he hesitated. After I prescribed him "Shengzhi Su" in an iron box, he completely quit after five weeks, without feeling any pain at all. His body became healthy and even more robust than before.</p>
<p>Sexual Enlightenment</p>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<h3>Treatment of Diseases Resulting from Masturbation</h3>
<p>...Most middle school students entering puberty have a tendency to indulge in this bad habit...The harm of excessive masturbation has a significant impact on both physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The so-called bad habit of masturbation is a type of abnormal sexual desire, which involves using various methods to stimulate local areas to crave a pleasant sensation.</p>
<p>However, the occurrence of this bad habit mostly happens most easily during the puberty of boys and girls. Moreover, this behavior can be practiced conveniently at any time and place, simply by concealing it from people's sight and without needing a partner. Most middle school students, both boys and girls, who are about to enter puberty often have a tendency to indulge in this unnatural bad habit. This is indeed something that teachers and fathers/elder brothers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Generally, matters concerning sexual desire, although shared by all people and are very important, are always regarded as simply vulgar behavior and disruptive to customs, and people are unwilling to study it openly. However, in reality, sexual desire plays an important role as the fundamental driving force of our human mental life. The various expressions of daily life are powerfully governed by the underlying sexual desire, a fact we already know. Moreover, in the early stages of sexual desire's arousal, or when all the harms of bad habits have already been suffered, if guidance on methods of suppression or treatment can be provided, the various diseases resulting from masturbation will not tend towards deterioration.</p>
<p>Masturbation is a bad habit commonly suffered by young people, so here, I will first record its origin, describe its harmful effects, and then suggest how to achieve its effective rescue, daring to trouble those who are aware to give it consideration.</p>
<p>The harmful effects of excessive masturbation cause many types of diseases on the body and mind. The most common is neurasthenia. After masturbation, seminal emission is inevitable. Semen is the foundation of human health. Frequent and depleted seminal emission will cause tinnitus, headaches, insomnia, forgetfulness, mental restlessness, and other phenomena. Over time, it will lead to explosive asthenia, impotence, premature ejaculation, small genitalia, and other symptoms, which are commonly seen. Regarding treatment methods, it is essential to quit masturbation, and then take "Hemitol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the seminal gate and stop seminal emission. After taking them for about two weeks, seminal emission can be completely cured. During treatment, the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" should be taken simultaneously to treat various neurasthenia symptoms, impotence, premature ejaculation, small local areas, and other sexual diseases caused by masturbation. Everyone knows that the gonads are the main sexual glands, so taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" is the most effective and rational treatment.</p>

<p>(Clinic) Second floor, China Trust Company at the corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Excessive Masturbation Leads to Loss of Function</p>
<p>Patient: Tao Jiaming, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, has lived in Shanghai for eight years. Occupation: porcelain worker. Address: 4th floor, No. 91 An Yi Village, North Xizang Road. (Chief complaint) — Started puberty at seventeen. At school, he was induced by bad friends to develop the bad habit of masturbation, sometimes even three times a night. In less than a year, his spirit was greatly damaged, and his body was abnormally weak, leading to frequent seminal emission and inevitable neurasthenia. Tinnitus, headaches, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations at night, night sweats, listlessness during the day, and weakness in the limbs. Although he knew the harm and tried to quit masturbation, he could not free himself from his addiction. He married in the spring of the 23rd year (of the Republic, i.e., 1934), and finally quit the bad habit. However, his sexual nerves were severely weakened, and intercourse was not firm. He suffered from premature ejaculation, and the second time he had intercourse, he experienced abnormal impotence. (Current symptoms) — Seminal emission at least three times a week, pale complexion, emaciated muscles, lifeless eyes, slow thinking, premature ejaculation, and impotence. (Treatment method) — Daily electrotherapy. Diagnosed that Tao's seminal gate was abnormally relaxed, so "Hemitol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" were prescribed to strengthen his seminal gate and stop seminal emission. In addition, "Shengzhi Su," a genuine gonadal hormone preparation, was prescribed for all neurasthenia symptoms, premature ejaculation, impotence, and other harms, to transform his weakened gonads into strong ones. In less than five weeks, seminal emission stopped, and his sexual weakness also improved. At the same time, his complexion became rosy, and his muscles were more developed than before.</p>
<p>(2) Effective Treatment for Small Sex Organs</p>
<p>Patient: Zhao Quansheng, 22 years old, from Anhui, working in a local pawnshop. (Chief complaint) — Has a history of masturbation, which he has not yet quit. Not only is he mentally disturbed and has slow thinking, but his sex organs are also underdeveloped and he has phimosis. Every night he has seminal emission, sometimes waking up after the emission, sometimes completely unaware. (Current symptoms) — Atrophied testicles, shaped like pigeon eggs, with astonishingly small sex organs. Also has third-degree phimosis, and severe neurasthenia. (Treatment method) — Quit masturbation, electrotherapy, surgery to remove phimosis. Perform prostate massage, and strictly guide him on health maintenance techniques. Use "Hemitol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to stop seminal emission. Use the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to replenish his energy, promote his development, enhance his nutrition, and consolidate his health foundation. After three weeks, seminal emission stopped first. After five weeks, the development and growth of the sex organs increased by two-tenths. Continue treatment, and after about nine weeks, his weight increased by twelve pounds, and neurasthenia completely disappeared. The development of the sex organs is very satisfactory, having doubled in size compared to the original.</p>
<h3>Post-Illness Imbalance</h3>
<p>To the Editor: My body is inherently weak and I am old and often ill, with constant reliance on medicine, especially severe in winter. This summer, I was ill again for two months, and I have become as thin as a stick. Despite trying to nourish myself, it is still difficult to restore my strength. This autumn, I was introduced by a roommate to use "Shengzhi Su" to nourish myself. The effect after taking it was astonishing, with a sudden surge in energy and an unusual development of muscles. This is truly incredibly miraculous! (Zhang Ping)</p>
<h3>Stomach Pain Like Cutting</h3>
<p>To the Editor: This summer, I ate too much watermelon, and I also had a fondness for ice cream, so my previous stomach pain worsened, with the pain feeling like being cut with a knife, and I knew there was no cure. Also, my digestion was exceptionally poor. Unexpectedly, my friend Mr. Wang introduced me to take "Stomach Pain Reliever," and the pain was completely cured. At the same time, because I took "Stomach-Strengthening Su," my appetite improved. (Xiang Yun)</p>
<h3>Leukorrhea and Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>To the Editor: My husband likes to frequent pleasure quarters and contracted gonorrhea. I was unaware and was infected, only then learning the truth. As a result, I suffered from severe leukorrhea, with a light green color and a very large flow. My husband was initially alarmed and bought "Anti-Lin," a combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine, to take together to treat gonorrhea. I also used "Leukorrhea Reliever" externally to stop leukorrhea. After only four weeks of use, both gonorrhea and leukorrhea were completely cured. I know there are many others with the same disease, so I dare to recommend it. (Sun Youfeng)</p>
<h3>Shrivelled Breasts</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have a history of irregular menstruation, so my body is unhealthy, and my breasts are abnormally shrivelled and lack beauty. I was quite anxious, and then I saw in the newspaper that "Female Shengzhi Su" can develop breasts and regulate menstruation. So, I bought and took two boxes. After taking it, my menstruation was indeed cured. At the same time, my body became stronger, and my breasts gradually became high and prominent. This is truly a good medicine for us women! (Shen Yizhen)</p>
<p>Beauty Research</p>
<h3>Comparison of Health and Beauty Between Chinese and Western Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, Medical Doctor, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>Modern aesthetic concepts are very different from the past, with more attention paid to the beauty of the overall figure in addition to the beauty of the face. The beauty of the figure is considered to be the beauty of curves, and the most striking of curves are the breasts. In the past, people were ashamed of prominent breasts, but in modern times, shrivelled breasts are considered ugly.</p>
<p>What else can be more sharply seductive? High, full, and elastic breasts, who can see them without their heart fluttering? No wonder women today pay attention to this. But in this regard, when comparing Chinese women with Western women, there is indeed no way to catch up. Only healthy and strong women in the world can have good development, making their breasts high and prominent. Chinese women are physically weak, and many are constrained by their parents, tightly binding their breasts from a young age, hindering their development and putting pressure on the heart and lungs, weakening the whole body and making them prone to irregular menstruation and leukorrhea. How can such women have good development, how can they make their breasts high and prominent? Seeing the Western women with their heads held high, chests out, and breasts bulging, one will naturally feel inferior in comparison.</p>
<p>How to remedy this deficiency? How to enable Chinese women to achieve the beauty of health of the times? The only method is to take the female gonadal hormone preparation "Female Shengzhi Su" to promote the activity of the gonads, and development can be improved, the breasts can suddenly become high and prominent, and the hips can become plump. Even weak and emaciated women can immediately achieve healthy beauty and stand on the same level as Western women. In addition, this preparation can also make menstruation regular and the whole body healthy. Those suffering from leukorrhea should separately use "Leukorrhea Reliever" externally to cure it completely. If the leukorrhea contains gonorrhea, it is advisable to also take "Anti-Lin," a combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment Common Knowledge</p>
<h3>Rational and Effective Treatment for Joint Pain</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Regarding the onset of this condition, because there are many causes, I believe there must be many people suffering from bone pain. Those most prone to suffering are those who are overworked and have weak constitutions. The reason is that the resistance of the aforementioned people is unusually weak. Therefore, low back pain is almost unavoidable. Secondly, irregular changes in temperature and humidity, with wind-dampness accumulating internally, is also a major cause of this condition. In addition, excessive debauchery, leading to incomplete clearing of gonorrhea toxins, can cause various joint pain conditions. The treatment method for this type of bone pain involving unclean blood composition is slightly different. If it is due to overwork and weak constitution, a gonadal hormone preparation should be taken to nourish it, and then take "Strong Stone's Myalgia Tablets," a special medicine that functions to dispel wind, eliminate dampness, clear blood, and prevent arteriosclerosis, then the joints will immediately feel comfortable, and the low back will also feel unusually relaxed. If you have frequented prostitutes in the past and suffered from gonorrhea, you must also take "Anti-Lin," a combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine, to thoroughly clear accumulated gonorrhea toxins, in order to achieve its outstanding effect. If you can treat it according to this approach, even if the disease progresses to hemiplegia, it will not be difficult to cure.</p>

<h3>Gas Mask Made from a Wine Bottle</h3>
<p>— (Yong Yan)</p>
<p>When the European War was in full swing on April 22, 1915, the Germans, disregarding everything, first tore up the Hague Convention's ban on poison gas and used poison gas to attack the Allied forces. At that time, the troops of Britain and France knew that relying on that sacred convention could not stop the attack of poison gas, so they had to take effective measures to deal with it. The troops on the front line immediately rushed to make many bizarre gas masks to meet this emergency.</p>
<p>Among these many bizarre gas masks, one type was made from a wine bottle. This mask was made by knocking off the bottom of a wine bottle and then filling the bottle with some moist soil. When using it, the mouth was placed on the bottle opening, the air passed through the moist soil in the bottle and was inhaled into the mouth, and the turbid gas was exhaled through the nasal tube. Of course, the effectiveness of this mask was very limited, but it was better than nothing.</p>
<p>But what about our gas masks?</p>
<h3>Sorrow and Wine</h3>
<p>— Bai Liu</p>
<p>There is champagne, beer, wine... mostly what the so-called "upper class" drinks. And most of it is imported from foreign countries, which seems inappropriate to talk about in these years of advocating domestic products. Thus, one cannot help but talk about domestic wine.</p>
<p>The wine name that is often poured into one's ears is of course "Shaoxing wine," and then "Yuanliang," "Gaoliang"... The most famous should be "Fenjiu" from Shanxi. Only by tasting it yourself can you know its delicate beauty!</p>
<p>Drinking wine, who isn't happy? A day of exhausting fatigue, a few cups of wine can greatly excite you! Ancient writers and poets could simply live in wine. Li Bai's verses: "Singing a long song in the pine wind, the song ends when the river stars are sparse, I toast you and you are happy again, carefree we forget our concerns together." Also, such as the "Drinking Alone Under the Moon" poem, all drink wine late at night, enjoying themselves. Originally, Li Taibai was a great wine immortal: it is said that the emperor sent him a wine-drinking passport, so he could drink wine all over the world without money. The Tang Dynasty poets' verses: "In the daytime, sing and let loose with wine," "Grape wine in luminous cups," "When should I bring wine to get drunk together on the Double Ninth Festival?" etc., can prove that they undoubtedly lived in wine.</p>
<p>Tolstoy wrote in the short story "Is This Really Necessary?" about the Sunday life of hard-working workers: "On Sundays, many workers get paid, go out to take a bath and rest. Sometimes they don't go to take a bath, but go to taverns and restaurants to drink wine, getting very drunk before stopping. But the next day, Monday, they have to do that kind of work early in the morning." Because the hard-working people are materially and spiritually deficient in various ways, they find satisfaction and happiness in the situation of "drowning sorrows in wine," even if they are full of stench.</p>
<p>The Japanese biologist Arakawa Jiro said: "If the social system is not fundamentally improved, alcoholic beverages can never be banned!" That kind of talk is really the truth. The United States has always banned alcohol, and in recent years it has finally lifted the alcohol ban. Because wine is the only comforter of hard-working people! Oh, Du Mu has the line "Wandering the rivers and lakes, traveling with wine," which can be said that wine is the greatest gift of the proletariat. Therefore, the business of cities and towns is sluggish or closed, while the wine industry and taverns have increased, which can make the wine owners smile.</p>
<h3>A Tu's Tavern</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>In the countryside shrouded in depression, everything is declining, and making a living is indeed not an easy task. Opening a shop is even more difficult than ascending to heaven. But A Tu's Tavern in our town is a bit of an exception.</p>
<p>A Tu's Tavern was just a few long planks laid out on the street ten years ago, with three or five short stools, holding a few pots of fatty fish and meat and water chestnuts with five-spice beans, with just one or two earthenware jars of Shaoxing wine and Gaoliang, slightly exuding a bit of fragrance. The customers were naturally only a few rural farmers and workers.</p>
<p>A Tu was a young lad. He combined the roles of waiter, cook, and accountant in one person, so his life was lonely and a bit pitiful. He couldn't get a rest at any time of day. He was always staring blankly at many customers, in a large restaurant across the street, coming and going in batches, but he was not envious or jealous. He always had a non-stop smile. He would just say: "This stall is really not enough for those grown-ups and gentlemen for one dinner!"</p>
<p>But now A Tu's Tavern is a well-known place for banquets for women and children. When the lights are lit at night, it is always full of guests, calling for fish and shouting for meat, and it is unusually lively. Most of the customers are also "long-robed class" people. Looking back at the large restaurant across the street, the doors can be netted to catch birds, as quiet as if it has lost its life, making people from other villages marvel at it.</p>
<p>In fact, A Tu's Tavern is still very ordinary. The dishes, wine, and people, everything is the same, except that the stall has been replaced with a storefront. Therefore, many people suspect that the feng shui of the storefront of A Tu's Tavern is good, but when we ask A Tu, A Tu just smiles and does not answer.</p>
<p>Based on the development of A Tu's Tavern, we feel that the possibility of cotton yarn tripping over a stone archway may actually be realized. At the same time, the decline of the rural economy can also be seen in this.</p>
<h3>"Remnants of Li Bai's Style"</h3>
<p>— Fangzheng</p>
<p>Anyone who loves a cup of wine seems to know about those small-scale taverns in Shanghai. For the class of literary beggars, their place for singing or dining often takes place here. They can be said to be the oldest customers.</p>
<p>Those small taverns, in addition to the usual horizontal sign, also add a vertical sign on the counter, writing the four large characters "Remnants of Li Bai's Style." This kind of display has almost become the most common trend in the wine industry. Thus, for example, if that shop was opened in the Republican era, or even opened today, it still cannot lack this kind of decoration that does not match the name. But what exactly is the explanation of these four characters "Remnants of Li Bai's Style"? After my speculation, it always cannot escape heredity and superstition, because the Chinese have always liked to stick to old ways, thinking that society is sacred and inviolable. Therefore, even if it is a custom from hundreds of years ago, in our society, it still maintains its inherent atmosphere.</p>
<p>Some people say that Chinese society is too contradictory. In fact, society itself is not contradictory, but human beings are backwards and forwards! Because some people have already tended towards Westernization, while another group of people still maintain their inherent national essence, so conflicts of opinion are bound to be inevitable.</p>
<p>Some people also advocate that reforming society cannot be improved. Therefore, you go to the United States for observation; he goes to Japan for research. What is the result? Returning, you still sigh in a contradictory society! And put all the previous plans and into a boring life, where heroes have no place to use their skills. Originally, the trend of restoration in our country is really too strong. Even with great abilities, there is no way to improve it!</p>
<h3>Difficult to Drink Wine</h3>
<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>Wine is a stimulating beverage that can make people excited, and many people like to drink it. At banquets, in order to make guests excited and happy, wine has become an indispensable side dish.</p>
<p>Wine in our country already existed in ancient times, in the Xia Dynasty, when Yu had the emperor's daughter order Di Yi to make wine and dispose of it. It can be seen that at this time, winemaking had already been invented. By the generation of Shao Kang, sorghum wine was made. The "Shi Ben" records that Di Yi first made wine lees, changing the five flavors, and Shao Kang made sorghum wine. This is the origin of sorghum wine. To this day, there are no less than dozens of kinds of wine. In addition to our country's original Shaoxing, Gaoliang, etc., there are also various foreign wines imported, such as brandy, koli sha, etc., with many names and different strengths of wine. But whether it is wine originally from one country or imported foreign wine, it is all made because it contains a kind of alcohol. The strength of the wine differs depending on the amount of alcohol it contains. Alcohol can be divided into two kinds. One kind is vegetable alcohol, extracted from plants, and drinking it is harmless, not affecting the health of the body. Another kind is mineral alcohol, which is extracted from minerals, and is extremely harmful to the body, and can even endanger life. Mineral alcohol is strong and cheap, so unethical winemakers do not brew it from plants, but use mineral alcohol as the raw material. Because it is strong and the cost is low, it is easy to profit. But those who drink wine suffer great harm. And now on the market, it is not known how many use mineral alcohol as the raw material, so those who have a Liu Ling addiction have developed a fear of difficult to drink wine. Therefore, when drinking wine, the first important point is to first understand whether the wine you are drinking is brewed from plants. Otherwise, it is better not to drink it, because there is a danger to life.</p>
<p>Many plants can be fermented to make wine and extract alcohol, such as rice, wheat, yams, mung beans, sorghum, corn, grapes, etc., all contain a lot of alcohol. Shaoxing wine is a kind of rice-brewed wine. The most famous wheat-made wine is beer. Grapes are fermented to make wine and brandy. Shanxi Fenjiu and Yanghe are all extracted from sorghum. Among them, the strongest is Fenjiu, containing 50% alcohol, followed by brandy, 74%, then whisk, 73%, Shaoxing 17%, and beer has the least, only 4%. But in recent years, wines such as Gaoliang, Shaoxing, inferior wine, inferior brandy, etc., all have mineral alcohol mixed in, making people afraid to try. Unless it is made by a reliable winemaking company, such as Zhang Yu Company, because they have millions of acres of vineyard in Yantai, they can guarantee that no mineral alcohol is mixed in, so you can drink with confidence. I am also one who has a Liu Ling addiction, but in order to drink domestic wine and avoid mineral alcohol, I only drink Yantai beer, and that reliable Shaoxing.</p>
<h3>Wine Talk</h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>Beyond one's career, pursuing entertainment. The city bustles, to which the vulgar flock. From the short, seek the long; rather choose fermented medicine. Reciting the line, "I urge you, drink one more cup of wine, to dispel ten thousand ages of sorrow," one cannot help but feel carefree and forget both favor and disgrace! I am not a wine person, yet I have much to say about wine. Not daring to emulate the dissipated, I would also say, is it not wise to engage in games of chance?</p>
<p>I am the least able to drink, yet I can discern the clarity, turbidity, purity, impurity, newness, and agedness of wine on my tongue. When questioning experts, I am right nine times out of ten. As Changli wrote, "Thoroughbred horses exist, but Bo Le is not always present." I shall boast myself as the "Bo Le of wine," but alas, I cannot put it to use. So even if the world has Bo Le, the connoisseur of horses, if scholars are not employed, is it not all in vain? Thinking of this fills me with emotion!</p>
<p>I am not good at drinking, but I am quite good at eating. The restaurants in Shanghai gather the specialties of various regions and the flavors of the whole country. I have traversed almost all of them. Would you say that while I am not a wine bag, I am rather becoming a rice bag? I once read Zhang Dai's "Tao'an Dream Recollections," and learned that refined people are not all wine immortals, but also gluttons. Am I not then without shame? I record this to show my sympathy and appreciate the elegance of his writing.</p>
<p>My family, starting with the Grand Master of the Imperial Stud, was known for heavy drinking, but later the tradition was lost. My father and uncle could drink a small amount. They would become deranged immediately after drinking fermented lees mixed with eggplant noodles. At family banquets, they only paid attention to the refinement of cooking and the skill of the chefs, surpassing all others in the Jiangzuo region. As soon as a dish was served, the brothers would devour it completely, and leave when full, never once raising a cup throughout the feast...</p>
<p>The mountain man Zhang Donggu was a wine lover who was always discontented. One day, he stood up and said to my father, "You brothers are strange! You only eat meat, not caring whether it is delicious or not; you only 'taste' wine, not knowing how to savor it!" These two sentences are quite refined, with a flavor of the Jin dynasty. Recently, a vulgar fellow included this in a collection, saying, "The Zhang brothers are truly peculiar in disposition! They eat meat regardless of its quality, and they do not drink wine regardless of its quality!" Every word is stiff and uninspired, missing the mark by a mile. Truly, there are many who turn gold into iron in this world!</p>
<p>Liu Ling is universally recognized as the foremost wine lover of all time. He once said, "I, Liu Ling, live for wine..." If this is to be believed, then he should have cherished his wine-filled existence! Yet, he always carried a servant with a shovel, instructing him, "Bury me when I die!" His intention was to show his courage in facing wine, and his determination to fight to the death. However, to stake one's life on wine, is that not akin to joining the ranks of desperate criminals? Drinking is a refined matter. Why the need for drawn swords and cocked crossbows? It only reveals self-abandonment. Why surrender to recklessness and madness, relying solely on the whims of fate?</p>
<p>Yuan Zhonglang declared himself abstemious, yet he established "wine regulations," meticulously detailed, with the strictness of Marquis Zhu Xu's military law. Is he not then a clear-headed observer? His younger brother, Xiaoxiu, was known for his drinking prowess. In his "Travel Notes," he wrote freely and sincerely, with much to be gleaned, such as, "In my life, I have never liked to drink to excess. One drink leaves me drowsy all day. I also dislike drinking too much at night, for it leads to restless sleep and a dull mind the next morning, even fueling lust and anger. I know it is a bitter pleasure, but living in this world, friends and relatives treat it as a ritual. Seeing my reputation for drinking, they are surprised if I do not drink at a banquet, so I am forced to drink... I often live in the city, constantly tipsy. After getting drunk, lustful thoughts arise. When water runs dry and fire blazes, how can one live long in this world?" He also said, "My nature chooses wine, but most wine is undrinkable, yet I cannot refuse it. Forcing myself to swallow it is like taking medicine! I cannot escape the world, so I cannot abstain. My easily swayed nature is further complicated by customs. Putting on a soft face for the sake of deepening relationships, what else can I say? In reality, what ruins my virtue, harms my life, and hinders my pursuit of the Dao, is undoubtedly wine." Indeed, all pleasures have their advantages and disadvantages. It is easy to abstain, but difficult to maintain, and it is a common human failing. People often keep this secret, but Xiaoxiu openly confesses, speaking frankly and without reservation. The statement, "Wine fuels lust and anger, how can one live long in this world?" is a well-informed commentary, elaborating on the ancient sage's teaching that "one can drink without limit, but should not descend into chaos." Is this not then wine that approaches virtue?</p>
<p>There was a wine lover who died in his fifties. As they prepared to verify his death, he suddenly revived, saying, "My illness is cured! Just now I heard in the underworld that I saw two giant jars, sealed with my name on them. One was already opened, with wine remaining in it. This is my allotted drink, I must finish it before I die!" He then resumed drinking for more than twenty years. One day, he said to his relatives, "Am I about to die? Last night I dreamed that all three jars of wine were empty!" Within a few days, he died without illness. This story is found in "Huai Xi Miscellany." Is it true that fine wine is a gift from heaven, and human effort cannot change it? That every drink and every morsel is predetermined? Then I see those who drink excessively and vomit profusely, with little wine actually entering their stomach and intestines. Is what they vomit not their allotted drink? It is merely an empty show of what is destined! Wasting the gifts of heaven, the wine is regrettable. Outwardly strong but inwardly empty, the person is even more pitiful. It is worthy of a laugh!</p>
<h3>Swapped Nests and Mating Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Swearing Allegiance with a Cup of Water, Speaking of Woe Under the Green Lamp; Hooking Fingers with Gold, Reporting Mutual Affection with Red Beans</p>
<p>Youmei slowly stood up, pressed her hands on the edge of the table, and looked at Menglan's face. There was no smile on her face, and her eyes stared intently without moving. After a long time, she said, "Can you pour out the bitterness in your heart?" Menglan sighed and lowered his head. Youmei then walked to his side, squeezed in to sit down, took Menglan's hand in both of hers, pressed her face to his face, and whispered, "Don't you trust me?" Menglan still didn't say anything, with a slight smile. Youmei then quickly returned to the chair opposite him, raised the cup of tea, held it level with her nose, and said to him, "Menglan, let's drink this cup. If I am unfaithful to you in any way, I have no integrity." As she said this, she raised the cup, but didn't drink or put it down. Menglan had no choice but to stand up, hold the teacup, and smile, "Mei, you're using a trick! But we are such good friends, you shouldn't use this kind of political tactic." Youmei remained, holding the cup, her face stern and refusing to answer. Menglan laughed, "There's no way, I'll drink this cup with you? But it doesn't have to be a kind of oath." Youmei said, "Of course I'll drink, I'll take this cup of tea as a kind of oath, how you feel, just depends on your friendship for me." As she said this, she drank the cup of tea in one gulp, like drinking wine, and even turned the cup over to show Menglan. Menglan had no choice but to drink the cup of tea with her. The two looked at each other, feeling rather despondent. The rain pipe outside the window was rustling, stirring people's heartstrings. Menglan seemed to be moved by something, put down the teacup, ran to Youmei's side, took one of his hands, pulled him to the bed and sat side by side. Then, very calmly, he called out, "Mei, I'll tell you now, please forgive me!" As he said this, he kept looking at Youmei's face. Seeing that his face had darkened, and even the breathing in his nose had slowed down a lot, the degree of his attention was conceivable. Two hours later, Menglan had said about 80% of what was on his mind. Then he turned his head to listen to the rain outside the window, which was no longer rustling like that. Only the eaves were dripping, making a continuous sound of raindrops. The kerosene lamp on the table also seemed to have lost a lot of its power, emitting a gloomy white light in the white lampshade, adding a special sense of desolation. Although the window was closed, there were traces of rainwater flowing down the glass, as if people were crying. The window also slightly revealed a gap, and in that gap, a cold air was permeating inward, and this cold air invaded people, causing an unspeakable thought. (97)</p>

<h3>Maintaining the Dignity of Official Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Official telegrams, also known as government telegrams, are ranked first in the order of dispatch. When transmitted by the telegraph machine, they should be given priority. The telegram is marked with the word "Official." To call a telegram "government," just speaking of the telegram itself, the status of official telegrams cannot be said to be undignified.</p>
<p>Where does the dignity of official telegrams lie? It lies in the content of the official telegrams, which completely involves national government affairs. The importance of the matter and the importance of timeliness are beyond the reach of other types of telegrams. Only because of this, when the bureau receives various telegrams at the same time, the dispatch or delivery of official telegrams must be before all other telegrams.</p>
<p>We value official telegrams and respect official telegrams. In fact, for decades, official telegrams have gradually lost their important nature and dignified status. The reason is that in the past, warlords sent official telegrams without following established rules, and used their official status to send official telegrams. As long as one was an official, regardless of whether it was a private or public matter, everything was sent as an official telegram. As a result, official telegrams became mixed and abused, leading to congestion of lines and backlog of reports. The economic aspect of telegraph administration also suffered due to the unpaid fees of official telegrams, and was on the verge of bankruptcy. Once the importance of official telegrams was lost, the credibility of official telegrams was also ruined. People viewed official telegrams as indistinguishable between public and private, and unable to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent, so the so-called dignity was merely superficial.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the National Government, it introduced restrictive measures for the abuse of official telegrams, and issued clear orders for the payment of official telegrams in cash, reversing the previous accumulated habits, and actually maintaining the dignity of official telegrams. Those in politics should know that official telegrams cannot be sent unless they involve government affairs, and that official telegrams themselves are important. According to regulations, they are sent in advance, and there is no need to mark them with the word "Urgent" before the telegram, to avoid adding unnecessary embellishment. As for the payment of fees in cash, it is related to the lifeline of the telegraph administration and is also necessary to maintain the national communications business. It is self-evident that they should be paid in accordance with regulations. In this way, official telegrams will be brought onto the right track, and the telegraph administration will also see the light, fully demonstrating the dignity of official telegrams under national unification, which is precisely to demonstrate that all political leaders are devoted to their duties and abide by the law.</p>
<h3>Method of Returning Telegram Receipts About to be Implemented</h3>
<p>— Jiong</p>
<p>Implemented from December 1st</p>
<p>Senders of telegrams are often very concerned about when their telegrams will be delivered to the recipients. The "Delivery Confirmation" method stipulated in Article 111 of the current Domestic Telegram Business Regulations is designed to meet the above needs. For example, if the sender wants the receiving telegraph office to immediately notify the sender of the delivery date by telegram after the telegram has been delivered, he may write "Electric Notice" or "(=PC=)" identifier at the beginning of the telegram, and pay an additional six words' worth of telegram fees at the ordinary rate, and the telegraph office can handle it accordingly. If the sender only wants the receiving telegraph office to notify the sending telegraph office of the delivery date by mail "Letter Notice" or "(=Pcp=)" identifier, and pay the postage for a single registered mail. However, both of the above delivery notification methods are handled by the receiving telegraph office directly notifying the sending telegraph office of the delivery date by public telegram or mail letter after the telegram has been delivered, and the sending telegraph office forwards the information to the sender. The sender is still unable to see the "Telegram Receipt" signed or stamped by the recipient in person, which is somewhat lacking. Moreover, in Chinese society, all personal interactions involving money or contracts, whether in law or accounting, attach great importance to receipts. Therefore, ordinary people often use double-registered mail when mailing important letters, so that the other party's post office can return a receipt signed or stamped by the recipient after the item has been delivered. We have a need to return the recipient's receipt for important letters, and we will naturally expect the telegraph office to return the recipient's signed or stamped receipt for important telegrams and remittance telegrams, so as to provide a basis for trust. In order to meet the needs of the public, the telegraph office has now formulated a "Method for Telegram Bureaus to Return Telegram Receipts," which will be implemented from December 1 of this year. The new method is excerpted below:</p>
<p>1.  If the sender wants the other party's telegraph office to obtain a receipt filled out by the recipient after the telegram arrives and return it to the sender, he only needs to write the words "Return Receipt" in the "Payment Identifier" box on the outgoing telegram paper (if using his own paper, then at the beginning of the telegram). "Return Receipt Wang Ying, Central University, Nanjing," if it is a foreign language telegram, then write the word Rpcp as an identifier. The identifier will be charged at a rate of one word. In addition, pay postage of nine cents in advance (i.e., postage for single registered printed matter), and the telegraph office can handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>2.  After the above telegram is delivered to the destination telegraph office, the telegraph office will specially prepare a "Telegram Receipt" and send it to the recipient along with the incoming telegram. In addition to asking the recipient to sign and stamp the receipt on the back of the telegram envelope as usual, so that the telegraph office can keep it for future reference, they will also be asked to sign or stamp the specially prepared receipt and bring it back to the telegraph office, so that it can be handed over to the post office and registered and mailed to the telegraph office at the original sending location. The sending location telegraph office will check the sender's address and send it back to the sender by messenger, and the sender will sign or stamp the messenger's delivery book as proof.</p>
<p>3.  If the sender has two or more telegrams sent to the same city at the same time and wants to use the return receipt method, in addition to writing the "Return Receipt or Rpcp Payment Identifier" on each telegram, he only needs to pay one postage fee in advance. The same applies to separate delivery telegrams. However, if you want to use the return receipt method for separate delivery telegrams, you should write the above payment identifier separately before each recipient's address, for example, "Separate Delivery Return Receipt Ding Zihong, 676 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing Return Receipt Dachangxiang, 20 Taiping Road," otherwise the telegraph office will only obtain a receipt from the recipient with the "Return Receipt" identifier and return it.</p>
<p>4.  The following telegrams cannot be applied to the provisions for returning receipts:</p>
<p>A. Telegrams sent to various places abroad and Macau: B. Telegrams sent to various places outside the pass: C. Telegrams sent to Hong Kong via water lines or wireless telegraph D. Telegrams forwarded via post office or railway telegraph lines: E? Telegrams collected and delivered by the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau or the railway station post and telegraph agency: F. News telegrams, urgent news telegrams, relief telegrams, meteorological telegrams, water level telegrams, ship telegrams.</p>
<p>The above newly established method of returning telegram receipts is also very applicable to social telegrams with red silks and gift certificates attached. After we deliver a social telegram with a gift certificate attached to the telegraph office to be telegraphed, we sincerely hope that the telegram and gift certificate can be quickly delivered to the recipient. However, recipients often don't have time to reply immediately because they are too busy with weddings and funerals, causing the sender to worry. If the sender adopts the above newly established method of returning telegram receipts, the receiving telegraph office can immediately return the "Telegram Receipt" signed or stamped by the recipient on the same day, even if the recipient cannot reply immediately due to being busy, it can also confirm that the social telegram and gift certificate have been delivered, so there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>In addition, when the sender sends the above "Return Receipt" identifier telegram, he should write down his name and address in detail on the outgoing telegram paper so that the sending telegraph office can deliver it by messenger after receiving the "Telegram Receipt" returned by the receiving telegraph office. Otherwise, if the sender's name and address are not written in detail, the "Telegram Receipt" may not be delivered. This point should be paid special attention to by the sender.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Points to be Noted by Telephone Users</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The points to be noted by city telephone users when using the telephone have been published in this publication many times. Based on the author's observations, the following are added:</p>
<p>1.  In principle, the location where the telephone is installed can of course be designated by the user, but in the following places, it is prohibited to install according to regulations, or if it must be moved after installation:</p>
<p>A. The installed machine is likely to be damaged by rain and snow, or excessive humidity, and easily damage the machine parts, and may interfere with listening, etc.:</p>
<p>B. Near electric light lines, or next to stoves and electric stoves, places where danger is likely to occur:</p>
<p>C. There are more than a few households living in one house, in the hall, corridor, and passageway, it is easy to damage the telephone, causing the user to suffer the loss of the machine.</p>
<p>If telephones have already been installed in the above places, please report to the local telephone bureau or telegraph bureau as soon as possible to apply for machine relocation, so as to avoid machine obstacles and compensation losses.</p>
<p>2.  For users with a business nature, such as shops, taverns, theaters, teahouses, hotels, and places with many entertainment venues or public access, a wooden box should be added outside the telephone - rectangular, slightly larger than the telephone, with a large hole on the side, where the transmitter and receiver can be hung outside, and if necessary, it can be locked to prevent the machine parts from being stolen.</p>
<p>3.  Residential telephones should not be installed too far away from the bedroom, because during the day there is the trouble of not being able to call the recipient immediately, and at night there is the fear of not responding to calls for a long time, which may delay important matters.</p>
<p>4.  Telephones must not be played with by children, because the cord of the common telephone receiver (commonly known as the earpiece) becomes entangled once it is touched, because the copper wires inside the cord are extremely thin, and if they are entangled, they are easily broken. And allowing children to play with it can easily cause dialing errors.</p>
<p>5.  Telephone calls are best made by the host or hostess in person (this refers specifically to private residences, excluding shops and other public places). Unless absolutely necessary, do not use servants. Even for small matters such as inviting guests and socializing, it is advisable to do it yourself, which can show respect and avoid being deceived.</p>
<p>6.  It is best not to make telephone calls during heavy rain and thunder, because if there is lightning in the air at this time, it is easy to induce the machine, which is dangerous. If it is necessary to make a call, avoid touching metal parts to ensure safety.</p>
<p>7.  If there is a fire in the city, and the location is far away from my residence, there is no need to inquire at the telephone bureau, because the switching room of the telephone bureau is extremely busy at this time, and all fire-fighting agencies and public security agencies must be notified separately by the bureau in order to send fire engines to rush to rescue and send military police to maintain order. Even if you call to inquire, you will not be able to get a detailed answer. If a fire occurs nearby, you should immediately notify the fire-fighting agency to warn, but for friends and relatives who call to inquire, there is no need to exaggerate the story, so as to avoid making the other party anxious.</p>
<p>8.  It is advisable to prepare a small notebook and a pencil next to the telephone. If you are not at home, after someone answers the call on your behalf, you can write down the caller's telephone number and a brief description of the matter, so that you can check and handle it when you return home.</p>
<p>9.  For telephone numbers that you often call, it is advisable to fill out a table and put it by the machine, so as to avoid flipping through the telephone directory.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Ministry of Communications Radio Station's First Children's Broadcasting Competition</h3>
<p>— Shen Airong</p>
<p>The mission of radio stations is to transmit important news in the fastest way. It was originally a useful tool for assisting social education. However, Chinese radio stations have been commercialized. Their main task is to advertise goods, and the original mission - transmitting important news and assisting social education - has become an accessory. Since the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications implemented the review of scripts, banned programs, and actively rectified them, the air has been cleaned up, and the ears have become much quieter. The Ministry of Communications Radio Station has been holding a children's broadcasting competition since August 3, with the aim of opening an aerial paradise for children on the one hand, and achieving the practical effect of broadcasting education on the other. This is a very good and meaningful thing. In order to understand what the content of this event is like? How is it done? I specially went to 137 Sassoon Mansion, Bund, Nanjing Road at about 6 pm on Monday to visit.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Radio Station is on the first floor of the Sassoon Mansion, and there are three rooms inside. One room is the machine room, one room is the office, and one room is the broadcasting room. The entire layout and equipment of the broadcasting room is worthy of the four words "luxurious and magnificent". Thick wool carpets are laid on the rubber floor, red velvet curtains are hung on the four walls, and five red gauze palace lanterns are hung on the delicately carved red ceiling. A very elaborate piano squats in front of the corner of the right wall, and a few chrome sofas stand neatly in front of the red velvet curtains. A red wooden long table stands dignifiedly in the center of the room not far from the window. On the side of the table near the window, there are broadcasting adjustment machines, microphones and other machines, as well as phonographs, etc. On a smaller table next to it, there is a radio and telephone, etc. This is exclusively for reporters to use. There is also a microphone in the middle of the broadcast room, which is exclusively for broadcasters, and another one is a spare. The entire broadcast room fully expresses the mood of nobility and luxury.</p>
<p>At the time of 6:15, two children came, wearing white cloth suits of the same color, wearing white canvas wide-brimmed hats, which were very neat and beautiful. These two were here to participate in the broadcasting competition. One is Miss Zhu Meiying, and the other is Miss Wang Cuiyun, who are innocent, lively and very cute.</p>
<p>The broadcast started at 6:30. The two little girls took turns standing in front of the microphone, singing in a delicate and soft tone. Miss Zhu sang "Selling Fried Dough Sticks", and Miss Wang sang "Grandma Zhang's Manor". The two ladies also sang "Butterfly Girl" together. Finally, Miss Wang sang a praise of sleep, all of which were very moving.</p>
<p>That day was the fifth day of the broadcasting competition. In the past four days, Liu Hongwen (talking about children's flying cars), Liu Qifang (singing blowing bubbles), Gu Wei De (telling the story of a loyal dog, singing the March of the Earth), Yu Weisheng (talking about how to be a good child, singing Mother), Xie Hongsheng (small stone), Xie Xiuzhen (singing the Hoe Dance Song), Zheng Zhongqin (singing which hug do you want), Zhu Juan, Hong Gendi, Zhu Meiying, Wang Yunhe sang the Effort Song together, many children broadcast. In the future, many children will broadcast fairy tales, stories, songs, etc. on the station every day, such as Hou Wenqing, "My New Outlook on Life", Wang Hanmin will broadcast "Scientific Children", Zhu Meiying, Chen Fenggui, and Wang Hanmin will broadcast the drama "Compassion", which are all very meaningful.</p>
<p>Although I have seen the children's broadcasts, I still don't fully understand what the children's broadcasting competition is all about, so I went to ask the hosts of the event, Mr. Wang Renlu and Xu Zhangli. The two gentlemen told me in detail: "Broadcasting competition is a shortcut for the implementation of children's education, because the programs broadcast by various stations are not suitable for children's personalities and interests at all. Children listen to boring and vulgar programs, which has a great impact on their physical and mental health. Therefore, we created this children's broadcasting competition, selecting stories, fairy tales, songs, etc. that are beneficial to children's physical and mental health and that children like to listen to, and letting children broadcast them to children themselves, the effect will definitely be much greater than adult broadcasts, because children are most easily influenced by children... All participants can also register for several competitions at the same time, and it is not limited to one program, so that they can fully express their specialties without burying talent. The types of competitions are divided into (1) speech, (2) singing, (3) debate or dialogue, (4) drama or opera, (5) others. After the competition, the ranking of the children who participate in the competition is determined by the judges hired by the station (Ministry of Communications Radio Station) and the number of votes cast by the audience... All the children who participate in the broadcast will receive prizes, which is just to increase the children's interest. 』</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wang also told me: "This time, the participating schools include Wanzhu, Wuben, Hean, Fudan Middle School, City Center Elementary School, Jingye, Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' Middle School and its affiliated elementary school, Yangzheng, Dianye, Nanyang Model, Yucai, Mingda, Qinde, Chengyu and other municipal and private schools, a total of more than ten schools. There are about two hundred children participating in the broadcasting competition. "</p>
<h3>Question and Answer</h3>
<p>Answer to Mr. Shen Shaowen from Anzhen, Taixian, Jiangsu</p>
<p>I have received and understood your letter. Here are the separate answers:</p>
<p>One, regarding the example you provided in your letter, "Zhang Buqing and Li Shengbo of Nanjing, unable to personally attend your birthday celebration, send our respectful telegram to wish you longevity, Wang Xingnan." If two copies are required, it should be written as: Tm2lt Nanjing Zhang Buqing and Li Shengbo, unable to personally attend your birthday celebration, send our respectful telegram to wish you longevity, Wang Xingnan respectfully. A complete telegram should be charged at 4.4 yuan for 22 characters (including 10 characters for the fee identifier, destination, and recipient's address, counted as 5 characters, and 15 characters for the text and the sender's name). An additional copying fee of 0.2 yuan is charged (for social telegrams, each copy within 50 characters is charged 0.2 yuan). Therefore, the total fee, including the telegram fee and the copying fee, should be 6.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Two, after reviewing the example format you provided in your letter, the telegram includes the word "Mr." When the telegraph office copies and delivers it, it will only be copied after the first recipient's name. If the sender wants the salutation to appear after both the first and second recipient's names during copying, the recipient's address should be written as Nanjing Zhang Buqing Mr. and Li Shengbo Mr. Then, when the telegraph office copies the telegram, the words "Mr." will be added after each recipient's name.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Our Association</h3>
<p>The name of this association is the China International Famine Relief Commission (social figures from various provinces involved in disaster relief often refer to this association as "the China Famine Relief Commission"). It is a special charitable organization registered with the Ministry of Interior. It was founded in 1921. Prior to this, in 1920, the five northern provinces experienced a severe drought, and Chinese and foreigners from various regions formed relief groups to provide aid. In the following year, as the disaster situation eased and relief efforts came to an end, on September 21st, the Beijing International United Relief Committee convened a joint meeting of representatives from various Chinese and foreign relief groups in Beijing (now Peiping) to discuss relief efforts. Representatives from Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jinan, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Hankou, and other seven associations attended, all recognizing that national disasters occurred frequently, relief groups were not connected, and both disaster relief and prevention were difficult. It was decided at the time that the seven groups would jointly organize a permanent central relief agency to manage the surplus funds of various relief organizations and coordinate national disaster relief and prevention efforts. On November 16th, representatives from various groups met again in Shanghai and formally passed the organization of the China International Famine Relief Commission. The regulations were drafted, and the general office was established in Beijing, with Mr. Liang Ruyihao publicly elected as president and Mr. Addams as general secretary, responsible for executing the association's affairs. Various Chinese and foreign relief groups were uniformly converted into branches to clarify the system, with the main mission being to organize relief for natural disasters and promote disaster prevention initiatives. Since the establishment of the general association, it has expanded from seven associations to a total of thirteen, including branches in Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Gansu, Suiyuan, and the Yangtze Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>This association is an international organization without religious or political boundaries. Each branch nominates one Chinese and one foreign representative as members of this association. A general meeting is held every two years to discuss association affairs and determine the direction of activities. The general meeting also elects no more than half the number of members from enthusiastic and respected individuals in society as additional members to assist with association affairs. The association has one president, one vice-president, one secretary (concurrently the general secretary), and one Chinese and one foreign treasurer, all elected by the general meeting for a term of two years. These constitute the highest officers of the association. The general meeting also elects six members, half Chinese and half foreign, who, along with the aforementioned officers, form an eleven-member executive committee to manage association affairs. Meetings are held on average once a month. In addition, various specialized committees are formed to take charge of auditing and reviewing matters.</p>
<p>The organization of the general office is headed by the general secretary, and it is divided into five sections: general affairs, auditing, agricultural benefits, engineering, and fundraising, to carry out all association affairs. Branch offices have been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, Anqing, and Nanchang.</p>
<p>The association's disaster relief methods strive to align with scientific principles and economic conditions, aiming to prevent disaster victims from becoming dependent and perpetually trapped in poverty. The principle of work-for-relief is implemented. Apart from providing appropriate assistance to the elderly, weak, and disabled: (1) no cash is given to disaster victims unconditionally; (2) no food is given to disaster victims unconditionally; (3) able-bodied individuals are made to engage in appropriate work to support their families; (4) in areas where food is scarce, food is used as wages; (5) wages are given based on the work unit and verified. These are the general principles of disaster relief.</p>
<p>Disaster prevention initiatives are especially emphasized. Disaster relief is urgent in the moment, and money and food are merely temporary expenses, while disaster prevention can eliminate disasters in the future. Therefore, since its establishment, the association has focused on disaster prevention initiatives. In terms of engineering, it undertakes water conservancy projects, builds roads, and repairs river embankments. In terms of agricultural benefits, it organizes cooperation and promotes well-drilling. The former belongs to disaster relief and prevention, while the latter focuses on rural construction and improving the rural economy.</p>
<p>Over the past fifteen years, annual reports in both Chinese and Western languages have been printed and sent to various sectors, detailing the association's disaster relief and river management efforts, as well as the income and expenditure accounts, to ensure credibility. Now, as the work of the past fifteen years comes to an end, this special issue summarizes the general situation of the association, including various charts and graphs, to report to those both domestic and foreign who are concerned with modern famine relief.</p>
<h3>The China International Famine Relief Commission Over the Past Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhengting</p>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission has been established for fifteen years. During these fifteen years, with the support of various sectors from abroad and the efforts of our colleagues at home, its scope has expanded daily, its activities have increased annually, and its operations in water conservancy, transportation, cooperation, and disaster relief and prevention have been repeatedly praised by society and rewarded by the government. As the unworthy chairman of this association, I am truly pleased! As we mark the fifteenth anniversary, I would like to respectfully inform the public of the history of its establishment, its organizational structure, its principles of disaster relief, and its past work, breaking them down into categories for clarity:</p>
<p>(1) History of Establishment: This association was established in the winter of 1921, following the great drought in North China. There were more than a dozen Chinese and foreign famine relief organizations in the country, but each operated independently and was not connected. The following year, after the relief efforts ended, representatives of the various groups met several times to discuss the aftermath. They all agreed that to eliminate disasters, there must be a permanent organization with unified authority to plan and prevent them in advance. Therefore, it was decided to establish the China International Famine Relief Commission in Peiping, converting the existing Chinese and foreign famine relief organizations into branches. This was the beginning of the association's establishment.</p>
<p>(2) Organizational Structure: This association is a charitable organization jointly established by Chinese and Western individuals, without any political or religious affiliations. It has been approved and registered with the Ministry of Interior of the National Government. The Executive Committee, composed of an equal number of Chinese and Western members, manages the association's affairs. The General Office is located in Peiping. Under the General Secretary, there are five sections: General Affairs, Auditing, Agricultural Benefits, Engineering, and Fundraising, which handle daily affairs. Branch associations have been established in twelve provinces: Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Suiyuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan. Offices have been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other locations. The Yangtze River Basin relief efforts have an Advisory Committee, which is based in Shanghai. In addition to planning the relief efforts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, it also coordinates and oversees all disaster relief and prevention efforts in the Yangtze River Basin and the areas of South China where branches have not been established. The Shanghai office also has a Volunteer Committee to assist in fundraising.</p>
<p>(3) Principles of Disaster Relief: Since its establishment, this association, mindful of the past where those engaged in famine relief often failed to think about prevention, only rushing to raise funds and beg for aid when disaster struck, and only providing clothing and food as a temporary and passive remedy, has realized that relief funds were quickly depleted, spending millions of dollars without improving the aftermath, and only fostering the dependence of disaster victims. Therefore, the purpose of this association is not limited to famine relief but emphasizes disaster relief and focuses not only on relieving existing disasters but also on preventing future disasters. The goal of this disaster prevention is construction. All activities such as opening canals, drilling wells, building roads and repairing embankments, and various facilities that benefit the people's livelihood are considered essential tasks of disaster prevention. This is the principle of "construction-based disaster relief." As for the principles of disaster relief, they were defined as follows at the sixth annual meeting held in 1933:</p>
<p>(1) When a disaster occurs, and local financial resources are clearly unable to prevent the loss of a large number of lives, and the situation is not suitable for work-for-relief, the association should provide emergency relief.</p>
<p>(2) The association should, to the greatest extent possible, adopt work-for-relief to engage in construction projects and short-term, low-interest loans.</p>
<p>(3) The association's main tasks are to continue to promote and implement various disaster prevention plans, divided into the following two categories: (A) construction projects such as roads, irrigation, dike repairs, well digging, wasteland reclamation, and water conservancy; (B) organizing credit, marketing, supply, and various cooperatives to improve the rural economy, improve agricultural methods, and promote household industries, so that farmers can gradually escape poverty.</p>
<p>(4) In both disaster relief and disaster prevention, the main responsibility still lies with the government and local authorities; the association is in a supporting role. The association's relief funds should be allocated according to the above standards to achieve the greatest effect; in other words, it is intended to encourage the local government and people to participate enthusiastically and to be determined to take responsibility.</p>
<p>(4) Past Work: For the past fifteen years, the association has carried out emergency relief and various disaster prevention activities in accordance with these principles; it has worked hard on construction to prevent natural disasters in peacetime, and has bravely provided relief when disasters occurred, treating the symptoms with emergency relief and cultivating the roots with work-for-relief, taking measures according to the circumstances, and proceeding in parallel. According to statistics, more than 50 million yuan has been spent, which is detailed in the annual reports and will not be described in detail here. Of all the past work, the most significant ones are briefly listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Canal Opening: The Jinghui Canal in the Wei River Basin of Shaanxi Province was jointly opened by the association and the Shaanxi Provincial Government, spending 1.3 million yuan, and irrigating no less than 600,000 mu of farmland. The Minsheng Canal in Lutaotou, Suiyuan, was started after the great drought in 1929, and the western section was completed in two years, irrigating 250,000 acres of land. In addition, there are the Shichang Canal in Hebei Province, the reservoir in Chunhua Town, Nanjing, and the canals opened in various provinces, which are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>(2) Well Drilling: Hebei and Shandong provinces have high terrain and are subject to continuous drought, resulting in significant losses, especially in 1920. The association widely advocated well drilling to provide irrigation. The association raised funds and gradually loaned them to farmers to engage in drilling, and a total of 5,727 wells were completed, each irrigating 6 mu of land, for a total of more than 90,000 mu of farmland.</p>
<p>(3) River Dredging: The association believes that dredging rivers can prevent floods, so it has engaged in this project for a total of 250 miles, not including the Quan River in Wenshang County, Shandong Province, which was dredged this year as a work-for-relief project.</p>
<p>(4) Dike Building: Over the years, the association has built dikes in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and other provinces, totaling 904 miles in length.</p>
<p>(5) Road Building: The association recognizes the close relationship between transportation and disaster prevention and relief, so it actively promotes the construction of highways. Statistics show that a total of 2,028 miles of highways have been built and 1,448 miles of old roads have been repaired in four provinces across the country. The largest project was the Xilan Highway, which runs between Xi'an and Lanzhou and is a major transportation route in the Northwest, with a total length of 480 miles and a cost of more than 500,000 yuan. After the main roadbed and mountain road were built, the Economic Commission of the National Government took over and completed the project. The highways in Hunan and Guizhou provinces were also pioneered by the association, and now vehicles travel smoothly, transportation is convenient, and travelers are at ease.</p>
<p>(6) Cooperatives: The association is recognized by society as the pioneer in promoting rural cooperatives in China. It was initially tested in Hebei Province and then gradually expanded to Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi provinces. As of April 1936, there were a total of 2,865 cooperatives directly guided by the association, and the total amount of loans granted to the cooperatives reached 730,750 yuan.</p>
<p>(7) Emergency Relief: Although the association strives to engage in construction and disaster prevention, it spares no effort in providing relief for sudden floods and droughts, such as sheltering disaster victims, managing price stabilization sales, distributing clothing, food, medicine, and education for disaster victims. Over the past decade or so, disasters have occurred frequently in our country, and the association has played a role in preventing the country's vitality from being greatly damaged.</p>
<p>From the above points, the association's history and achievements can be seen. The progress of the cause is not yet complete. To seek progress for society and welfare for the public is its greatest ambition. We hope that people from all walks of life will support us so that we can make progress, and national economy and people's livelihood will benefit from it.</p>
<h3>Construction of Roads and Land Reclamation in Northern Jiangsu by the Association</h3>
<h3>Outline of Future Association Work Plan</h3>
<p>The Famine Relief Commission has never commemorated its anniversaries, because holding commemorative meetings every year is really meaningless. This year is its fifteenth anniversary, so there is a slight activity. The intention is to end the past and inspire the future.</p>
<p>Readers know something about the Famine Relief Commission's past. It emphasizes both relief and disaster prevention. But looking at its past achievements, its work has been focused on disaster prevention. The roads it built and the rural cooperation it assisted are all articles written on the surface of disaster prevention, which is to say that it has made a slight contribution to the entire rural construction movement.</p>
<p>If we say that because it has done those things, it has actually prevented many natural disasters and invisibly reduced the number of people who have starved to death, no one dares to make a judgment. Moreover, the author dares to boldly say that, in addition to the 50 to 60 million yuan of relief funds directly benefiting and the dikes and weirs repaired directly protecting the land, which can be estimated by looking at the map, in this disaster-prone country, the proportion of its disaster prevention work is like a drop in the bucket, which is probably an exaggeration. Therefore, the Famine Relief Commission's positive disaster prevention work, written in a report or on a map, looks colorful and impressive, but the significance of its work is not here.</p>
<p>The Famine Relief Commission is fortunate to have been able to work with many contemporary social service organizations, such as the Rural Education Movement and the Vocational Education Society, from the previous era of warlord infighting for fifteen years, finally creating an atmosphere, changing the public's outlook, and encouraging the courage of many people to build. Technically and in terms of talent, it has also stored some materials for the country to meet the occasional needs of today's government and society. This is the unexpected harvest of the Famine Relief Commission and its greatest success. It is the greatest honor for it to be able to contribute to today's rural construction with its qualifications as a charitable organization.</p>
<p>Now we have entered a period of construction. The government's efforts are based on construction. In recent years, the construction of highways, the request for water conservancy, and the promotion of cooperative undertakings have all made significant progress every year. At this time, if the Famine Relief Commission continues its old business and does those things that were previously thought to be necessary but are no longer necessary, it will only waste relief funds on repetitive tasks, and even disrupt the system and hinder the progress of the entire plan. It would be better to follow the Famine Relief Commission's consistent service tenet and open up ways to serve the people. The Famine Relief Commission recognizes this environment, so it has decided to bring its past undertakings to a close, redefine the direction of future association affairs, and take the opportunity of the 15th anniversary to make a report to society.</p>
<p>As for cooperative undertakings, the Famine Relief Commission has taken a trial and error attitude from the beginning. In places where there is no cooperative undertaking, it does some "pioneering" work, but it does not dare to undertake large-scale promotion, because the Famine Relief Commission knows that it does not have the strength and cannot bear this responsibility. As for discovering new problems, it originally intended to come up with a plan to try it out in the field, and thus get experience, etc., the Famine Relief Commission is very willing to do it. This kind of technical trial has its own value, so the Famine Relief Commission will still concentrate its efforts on this aspect in the future. It has now handed over the promotional work to the government agencies. This is in terms of rural cooperation.</p>
<p>In addition, the Famine Relief Commission will allocate some strength to further study the technology of relief. Natural disasters are prevalent every year. Not to mention that construction undertakings are still making efforts in various areas of our country, disaster shortages are inevitable. Even in countries where construction undertakings are very developed, relief is also necessary. In recent years, the relief undertakings in the United States have been carried out vigorously, which is a clear sign. Since relief is an inevitable task, we should study the technology of relief.</p>
<p>The Famine Relief Commission's future work plan is roughly like this. That is, in peacetime, to expand the effectiveness of construction, assist the people in increasing production capacity, and implement its disaster prevention proposition. When natural disasters occur, we must be able to fully mobilize to rush to the disaster area, truly rescue people from water and fire, and fully发挥the effectiveness of relief.</p>
<p>This "three-yuan plan" has been considered and discussed by the Famine Relief Commission for more than two years, and has only recently been decided to be implemented. The 15th anniversary is the dividing line between the old and new association affairs plans. It has always wanted to "go where people do not go and do what people do not do." Its future facilities will of course adhere to this view to realize it. The work plan should be slightly changed according to the environment, but its purpose of serving mankind is conservative and unchanging.</p>

<h3>Vacant House Donation</h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>Shanghai's market, because of the "special depression" caused by the recession, and the erosion of external forces, has become worse day by day. This is a very obvious and well-known "fact". For this reason, the number of shops that have closed down in Shanghai in recent years, even in prosperous commercial centers such as Nanjing Road, Gongguan Road, and North Sichuan Road, is very alarming. In mid-August, a reporter from a certain news agency made a statistic saying that the number of vacant houses on the above-mentioned roads accounted for one-sixteenth to one-sixth. Can we not be alarmed by this number? At that time, this alarming number aroused many emotions. The news published in this newspaper on the 10th of this month, "The Chinese taxpayers' association in the Public Concession, in view of the fact that collecting vacant house rent can reduce rents and promote the market, the French Concession has implemented it, and especially suggests that the taxpayers' association should transfer to the Public Works Department to follow up and implement it in order to maintain the market," can also be said to be one of the "conclusions" drawn from the "emotions" at that time. However, it seems that there is still room for discussion about the correctness and usefulness of this "conclusion".</p>
<p>I remember that at that time, the terror of "vacant houses" caused a temporary re-stimulation of the rent reduction movement, so that rents were reduced, and the cost of general stores could be reduced proportionally. They of course thought that "once rents are reduced, they will flock to rent houses for business." (Quoted from the original letter of the Chinese taxpayers' association on the 10th of this month) However, if we broaden our horizons and "comprehensively consider" the reasons for the decline of the market, whether remote or recent, we will definitely see that people in general do not "rent houses for business" not simply because rents are expensive. Of course, expensive rents are also one of the reasons, but only "one of the reasons". It does not mean that by solving this problem, that is, slightly reducing rents, the decline of the market can be completely solved. This is what we should especially solemnly point out.</p>
<p>On August 27th, the author of "Talks" said a few words about the terror of "vacant houses". I remember the general idea was: our understanding of the current situation of stores always "selling out" and "closing down" should first "deeply understand the basic reasons for the decline of the market". Then, needless to say, the intensification of the national crisis has been deeply affected, and the smuggling that is sensationalizing the whole country is "driving straight in" to attack our vital points, making our weak national industry even the "last struggle" in vain. Then, in other words, under the absence of protection, our commerce can only "wait for death with its hands tied", how can the market prosper under this situation?</p>
<p>Now, less than three months later, the situation has moved forward one step further. The national crisis has reached the final and final juncture due to the emergency situation on the border. The rent reduction movement that was surging temporarily three months ago still could not save the market from declining. How can we now use the "vacant house" donation as a morphine injection to re-stimulate the rent reduction movement?</p>
<p>We approve of all methods to save the crisis at the edge of the cliff, but we have one request, that is, this method must be guaranteed to be feasible and harmless. On the contrary, those that only talk about it eloquently, but can only lead to a more difficult situation in reality, are not acceptable.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Kunshan County Agricultural Extension Office</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) The Kunshan County Agricultural Extension Office is a pioneer in rural revitalization and agricultural development. I had long heard about its achievements and past circumstances, but due to a lack of opportunity, I had never visited it in person. Yesterday, taking advantage of my trip to Ma'anshan, I made a special visit. Now, I might as well jot down my impressions below for the reference of those who study agricultural issues and care about rural construction.</p>
<p>The office is county-run, so all expenses are allocated by the county. However, the office was established in 1928, initially as the Kunshan County Sericulture Farm. It was reorganized into an Agricultural Improvement Farm in 1931, and then renamed to its current name in 1933. They now have 160-170 mu of cultivated land, including more than 11 mu of farm base, over 10 mu of dry land, over 70 mu of paddy fields, over 30 mu of mulberry orchards, 6-7 mu of forest nurseries, about 2 mu of ponds, and another 20 mu or so. Only 7-8 mu are leased out. In addition to this experimental planting farm, the office also has three extension areas: the first area is in Zhujia Bang Village outside Daxi Men, the second area is in Dongzhuang Village near Lujia Bang Station, and the third area is in Xugong Qiao Town near Anting Station. There is also a guidance station in the Qiyu Village area of Yangxiang Jing.</p>
<p>As for the improved varieties that are currently being promoted, rice cultivation is the main focus. The varieties include San Yi Si, San Yi Ba, Yi Shi Xin, Lu Gan Bai, Fei Lai Feng, Chu Shu Huang, Mao Zi Tou, Guang Tou Huang, Qu Yu, and others. Other varieties such as Wu Xiang Geng and Tian Luo Huang are not widely promoted due to yield concerns. The next priority is wheat cultivation, but there are fewer wheat varieties than rice varieties. Therefore, the farm only promotes a few varieties such as Xiaomai, Huo Liao Mang, Xiao Hong Mang, Nanjing Chi Ke, and Wujin Wu Mang.</p>
<p>In addition, the promotion of forest seedlings and mulberry orchards has also been quite successful in the past three years.</p>
<p>In terms of sericulture, in addition to raising demonstration silkworms to promote sericulture, they have also established three sericulture guidance stations, dispatching personnel to conduct regular guidance. As for animal husbandry, improved breeds and superior breeds of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, bees, and fish are all included in the promotion efforts.</p>
<p>Speaking of the implementation methods and steps of the promotion, the office first selects excellent varieties of crops from outside and trials them on the land in its own experimental field for two or three consecutive years. If the results are indeed better than local varieties, they are officially planted as demonstrations in the demonstration area and promoted to farmers. However, the promotion is limited to farmland in the special zone. However, if other farmers are willing to voluntarily switch varieties, the office can also provide seed seedlings.</p>
<p>Farmers who are specially selected must absolutely accept the guidance of the office and be diligent and honest. After being specially selected, not only are the seed seedlings supplied by the office, but the office can also dispatch personnel at any time to guide the improvement of cultivation methods, as well as pest control and irrigation. At harvest time, the crops must be exhibited and competed, and prizes are awarded for excellent results. If the results are inferior to local varieties, the office will provide subsidies. The office is particularly committed to promoting afforestation and fish farming, and has a large number of forest seedlings and fish fry available for distribution to farmers.</p>
<p>They are also very serious about their work on a regular basis, such as handling agricultural inquiries, publishing illustrated brochures on agriculture, informing farmers of the benefits and methods of planting trees, brochures on locust control, explanations of suitable seedling beds, illustrated guides to rice stem borer control, and key points of rice stem borer control. They hold meetings with township chiefs and farmers to discuss agricultural knowledge or exchange improvement ideas. In addition, they hold county-wide agricultural product exhibition and competition meetings, hire experts to form a review committee to separately review the performance of the products, and issue certificates or prizes to various agencies and organizations according to the categories of excellence, in order to encourage them. Jointly prevent rice stem borer damage: The office deliberates on the weather and climate, formulates a stem borer control plan and reward and punishment measures, and submits them to the county government to instruct the district offices to order the township chiefs to urge farmers to strictly prevent and control the stem borers in accordance with the stem borer control methods guided by the office, so as not to damage the crops. Repair the embankment to prevent flooding. Multiply trees to help regulate climate and drought.</p>
<p>It is said that their extension area was only 1,000 mu last year, but this year the rice cultivation alone has reached 4,000 mu. They plan to expand to 40,000 mu next year. The regular expenses have never exceeded 10,000 yuan in the past, and they should not exceed the budget in the future.</p>
<p>In the future, in addition to preparing for large-scale promotion and improvement of fine varieties, they also plan to promote cooperative improvement of agricultural management, organize electric irrigation and drainage, promote fish farming cooperation, jointly prevent stem borers and locusts and other pests, and train a large number of management personnel for water pumping machines. Some of these plans have already been started, while others are in progress.</p>
<p>The office now has seven staff members and more than 20 water pumping machine operators, more than 20 self-built houses, a boat, a livestock farm, a sericulture farm, a bee farm, and a fish pond. All kinds of operating tools, books, instruments, specimens, and medicines are available.</p>
<p>After visiting the office, on the train back to Shanghai, recalling the impressions of the visit, I felt that such an agricultural extension office should be established in every county, and even in every village. I hope that the local authorities will follow suit, as this may be more practical for alleviating rural poverty and revitalizing the countryside!</p>
<h3>Autumn Wilderness</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>It started raining heavily on the seventh night of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and continued like a downpour the next day. Sometimes the gray sky would brighten for a moment, and the children would jump under the eaves and shout:</p>
<p>"Brighten up, rain a zhang."</p>
<p>It wasn't until the third day that the rain seemed to subside and turned into fine, soft droplets. People were worried that the mountain torrents would rush down. The crops were still very tender, and if the water went over their heads, the wives and children would have nothing to do but cry after the autumn harvest. The men went to the river bank, and the river had indeed risen, but there was no foam on the water, unlike the dirty water flowing down from the mountain streams. Every farmer's back was covered in a cold sweat, and he gasped and said to himself;</p>
<p>"Don't let it rain anymore."</p>
<p>The rain stopped at night, and people squinted and looked up. The stars were like grains scattered on the threshing floor, filling the blue sky. There was a bit of wind that made people forget to take out their fans. Everyone's heart sank peacefully, thinking of the big, laugh-inducing ears of grain.</p>
<p>The sun dried the standing water in the fields. The sorghum was growing taller and taller, and the millet was beginning to sprout ears. But there hadn't been a drop of rain for a month, and the ears of grain were waiting for enough rain to set the浆. People hoped for a little more rain! But the river had dried up, and the silt on both sides had cracked into huge seams, peeling up thick layers of mud like small dustpans. In the twilight, perhaps dark clouds would rush across half the sky like running horses, and a few muffled thunders would sound in the middle of the night. But when dawn broke, there was still not a drop of rain. In the dark blue sky, a golden sun gradually climbed to the top.</p>
<p>The sorghum was ripening the red米 on its thin stalks, and the cotton was stretching its purple stems, smiling at the scattered sunlight. Red and yellow flowers were blooming luxuriantly on the dense green leaves. The millet was pitifully covered with black aphids. The leaves were eaten bare, and countless dark-colored bundles were floating on the tiny ear stems as if they were swollen. The farmers felt like their hearts were being gnawed at and they wanted to cry. No one could think of a way out. They had prayed for rain, but the statue of the god was exposed to the poisonous sun for many days, and the willow branches inserted in the god's seat were withered. Bird droppings had fallen all over its body, and no one carried it back. The farmers did not dare to hate the sky. The energy they had spent in the year had not yet driven them to despair. They focused all their beautiful hopes on the dark purple cotton seedlings and the maize spitting out yellow tassels.</p>
<p>There were drug addicts who injected morphine in the village, and there were mothers who didn't have enough to eat but still had a string of children. They didn't despise the small ears of grain that the farmers complained about. In the quiet of the night, they waded across the small river to pick the ripe sorghum with large ears, cut it off and made small bundles, and carried it on their shoulders. If they were unfortunately seen by the farmers who had worked hard all summer plowing the fields, an arm would be broken from it, or a pool of dark blood would flow on the parched earth. It was all uncertain.</p>
<p>The sorghum gradually ripened, and every family harvested the grain and carried it to the baskets. Looking at the shriveled piles that looked like small graves, they sighed. The maize was completely dry in the silo because the sky had never dropped a drop of rain. The seedlings of every family had died from the drought. The maize was just at the time of灌浆, and the farmers frowned tightly, forming a knot. They peeled a maize stalk and squeezed it, and the grains broke and shot out milk like threads.</p>
<p>"It's enough to cook, otherwise, the freeloaders will steal it."</p>
<p>The fields were gradually cleared, and only the thick, snow-like cotton was in full bloom in the autumn wind of September. In every cotton field there was a small thatched hut, and a cotton watcher sat at the door holding a shotgun.</p>
<p>The autumn wilderness was gradually desolate.</p>
<h3>Purple Grapes</h3>
<p>— Fang Jie</p>
<p>Walking on Avenue Joffre, I happened to pass a fruit store and saw many round, purple, and lovely purple grapes piled up inside. I really wanted to buy some to take back and eat, but when I touched my empty bag, I had to extinguish this idea. In the end, I cast a greedy glance before walking away dejectedly.</p>
<p>This reminded me of an interesting story: In the summer of this year, I was still lodging at a friend's house. Because my friend's father was a respectable country gentleman, he often liked to interact with country gentlemen who were equally respectable.</p>
<p>It so happened that he also had a few purple grape vines planted in his yard. In May and June, they were already bearing fruit in abundance, covering a pergola. Anyone who walked nearby would inevitably have their mouths watering. When my friend's father noticed this situation, he immediately became very vigilant. Whenever someone walked past, he would always say, "Don't touch those purple grapes!" In this way, even many passersby, in order to clear themselves of suspicion, would quickly walk past.</p>
<p>My friend's father was very happy, and then he began to plan: He should send some to so-and-so to eat, so-and-so should get a little more, so-and-so could be treated a little carelessly...</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, one night, the purple grapes were still stolen. He was immediately very angry, and scolded these people for being base and lowly, and even willing to commit a moral crime for a little greed! Naturally, there were many people who sympathized with him and joined in the scolding: These fools simply lacked cultivation of their character!</p>
<p>I was often surprised and a little pitying. Why were these people so unscrupulous?</p>
<p>Afterwards, the purple grapes ripened, and according to the pre-arranged plan, many people tasted the fresh flavor. As a guest, I naturally received a share of the gift!</p>
<p>But my friend's father was still very indignant. He still couldn't forget the theft. In his opinion: Although purple grapes are insignificant, the increasing trend of the world's customs towards薄浇 is a cause for deep concern!</p>
<p>But it wasn't until now that I suddenly realized: What's the use of my friend's father's deep concern? The power of morality may not be able to forge the cultivation of character, right? If there had been no one in that fruit store, I would have definitely stolen it once at that time.</p>
