<p>英國保守黨內閣終於揭開它的假面具而宣佈對意取銷經濟制裁了我們如果認識淸楚保守黨以往一貫的政策也就不以這樣的「可恥」行動爲可怪近幾年來英國外交一貫的政策我們知道是在不損害其自身利益範圍以內犧牲弱小國家的利益而給侵略國家以相當的滿足因此在其黨中靑年外交家如艾登輩心目中也許有所謂集體安全這觀念的存在而死硬派如皮佛洛克爵士準死硬派如張伯倫兄弟如黨魁包爾溫等根本就認定集體安全是一個漂亮而無用的名辭在保守黨中這些極占勢力的分子看來國聯是一無用的機關而英國主張制裁亦是多此一舉英國爲維持本國安全何必惜一阿比西尼亞爲保護本國利益更何必依附於國聯這無用的工具保守黨始終想與意國妥協在意阿尚未正式宣戰以前卽提議根據過去條的以求與意國訂立一新協定犧牲阿國一部分利益以滿足墨索里尼</p>

<p>政治北信貶損國家威望　反對黨準備提彈劾動議</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日院辯論外交事件之際、勞工反對黨領袖艾特里因政府决議贊助取銷對意制裁之結果、特宣布定下星期二日在下院動議彈劾政府案、</p>
<p>辯論開始時、下院空氣殊形激昻、座無虛席、旁聽欄中亦吿人滿、外相艾登宣布政府之决議時、屢受妨阻、反對黨且高呼「可恥」「辭職」等口號、在某一時中因後席之工黨議員與擁入勞工席之保守黨議員數人起爭之</p>
<p>故、外相之演說曾停頓足十分鐘之久、</p>
<p>外相之演說、其主要點如下、</p>
<p>政府之意見、地中海某某數國所予遇被攻時互助之保證，不得與制裁同行終止、</p>
<p>英國决在地中海中、永遠維持較意阿戰爭開始前更强固之防禦地位、</p>
<p>政府决議國聯應仍存在、但應加以改組、使以後應付各事有成功之最佳機會、</p>
<p>政府取銷對意制裁之决議、爲勞工反對黨格林武與自由反對黨喬治痛加抨擊、格林武並在反對黨歡呼聲中動議縮减外交部之預算、格氏謂外相之演說至可扼腕、等於對狄克推多之交易、數百萬人聞之、皆蒙羞而震恐、已往五年中政府之外交政策貽害無窮、目前之態度允屬卑劣、堪稱英國歷史中最大之政治背信行爲、政府作此突然可驚的轉變、實由霍爾爵士回閣有以致之、（按霍爾爲現任海相、曩因與法前外長賴伐爾商妥意阿爭案解决建議爲英國民衆反對而辭外相職、）霍爾之回閣、實爲加諾反對「霍賴建議」數百萬民衆之侮辱、近者財相張伯倫之演說、表示政府之政策、且含有限制國聯之權力、而回復區域協定、此亦爲人所不滿者、政府盍速辭職、以讓賢能試行其政網云、</p>
<p>喬治繼格林武起立發言、謂政府如今赴日內瓦承認其已被打敗、國聯已吿失敗、不再有所作爲、則等於國聯權威之終止、國聯之部位並未破裂、但艾登實赴日內瓦破裂之、並搗毀國聯、渠願艾登辭職以讓賢路云、反對黨聞此言皆歡呼不已、</p>
<p>外相答覆喬治之質問、謂法國新政府曾吿渠、法國不欲倡議取銷制裁、法政府從未予渠絲毫表示、以明法國願維持目前之制裁、或將贊助實施其他制裁云、</p>
<p>首相包爾溫繼起致詞、政府黨中歡聲雷動、首相謂國聯秋季集議時、必須嚴重考慮集體安全之整個問題、英政府之意見、集體安全已吿失敗、國聯在任何時中之力量、必須立於可保以或種迅速威權抵制侵略者之地位、已往數月中之經騐、已切實證明使國聯達於此種地步之集體安全、尚未存在也、</p>
<p>首相次論及歐洲一般大局、謂政府視爲最重要者厥爲德法英三國應駢肩合作、以經營歐洲之和平、現望使德法兩國能相會商、以謀歐洲和平之更佳的安全、外相頃間表示之意見、實受政府一致之贊助、政府深知取此行動、必爲英國人民一大部分所厭惡、但政府爲大局計、無庸示懦云、</p>
<p>艾特里繼起對首相之演說、表示大不滿、並宣布勞工反對黨擬於下星期二下院繼續辯論時動議彈劾政府案、彈劾案宣布「政府因缺乏堅决一貫的外交政策、已减低大不列顚之威望、並挫弱國聯危害和平、故已喪失下院之信任、」</p>
<h3 id="c16">艾登演辭大要 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>認繼續對意制裁無裨益　地中海互援保證仍有效　今後努力促進法德諒解</p>
<p>外相艾登曾發激昂之演說、宣布政府决計贊助對意制裁之取銷、謂政府準備參加集體决定的任何行動、並已决議對意制裁之繼續實施、無益於事、惟渠願保證者、政府擬竭力恢復國聯之充分權威、外相某段演說中、述及英政府一再努力使法德兩國相親善、並述三月七日德政府廢棄其羅迦諾公的義務所引起之大局、謂英政府在目前之環境中、覺當盼望德政府對英政府關於希特勒和平方案之條問、早日予以答覆、</p>
<p>外相開始外交事件之辯論時、謂政府歡迎獲有機會、得以表白其對國聯所遭許多問題之態度、國聯各會員國當於本月吿終之前、會同對此諸問題商妥一種决議、自意阿戰爭開始後、英政府卽充分參加集體行動、或謂集體行動應更求完備者（反對黨此時曾高呼以斥）但無人能吾認英政府已盡其全部職責、英政府今後仍將如是、凡國聯大會所决定之行動、計入將充分忠賊助行之、政府若爲謹愼語、固可置之弗顧、但右國聯艱難之秋、遽行出此、英國民衆必以爲此非勇俠之行爲、政府之意見若是、而渠亦深信者也、政府不特當恪守集體决議、且當指導以獲之、此爲政府對國聯其他會員國所負之責任外相繼乃引述每一爭案提交國聯時、英政府輙不避危難、首先倡議、在此擾據之時、若規避領導之義務、恐非正道也、渠深覺就吾人所擬予困擾之餘衆以表率而言、此必將爲許多方面所歡迎、</p>
<p>外相至是乃轉論國聯在目前環境中應如何作爲問題、謂制裁之未實踐所爲實施之自的、此爲衆須承認之事實、阿此西尼亞今已在意國軍事佔領中矣、就築所悉、阿比西尼亞任何部分不復有阿政府之存在、目前經濟壓迫計畫、縱繼續實施、亦斷不能恢復阿比西尼亞之地位、除外方之軍事行動外、無有可達此目的者、就渠所知、其他政府均不準備取軍事行動、卽英政府亦確如是也維持目前之制裁、而無任何明白規定之目的、則其結果徒足摧毀制裁之陣錢、而國聯勢將在短時期中遭遇一種事態、其權威之墮落、必更勝於今日、雖國聯未能設法阻止違犯盟的者之吿厥功成、但政府並不以此爲憾渠信國聯其他會員國亦不以此爲憾、蓋各國已曾盡力爲之矣、職是之故、無所抱歉亦不必退縮、英政府之意見、國聯去秋對侵略行爲所下之判詞、實無修正或撤銷之問題、</p>
<p>外相於繼續考慮國聯將來行動之前、曾作厲行盟的國彼此互助之重要宣言、外相引述地中海某某數强連英政府在內、曾於去年十二月遵照國聯盟的第十六條第三節彼此交換之保瞪、謂英政府之意見（此項意見將在日內瓦聲明、以爲信任之助）如國聯大會决定取銷制裁、此種保證、不得隨制裁而消滅、制裁取銷後、必有擾攘不定之時期繼之、在此時期中前項保瞪應繼續有效、政府就已往數月之經騐考慮、决定英國應永在地中海維持意阿戰爭發生前更强固之防禦地位、外相末乃討論國聯之前途、謂會員國對此急應加以熱切之考慮、渠須聲明者、英政府决議國聯應繼績存在、國聯嘗圖遏止侵略而失敗之事實、非爲對此抱憾之原因、實爲應予整頓、而使日後有更佳成功機會之原因、具此目的、故已往數月中所得之敎訓、必須加以分析者也、（十八一日路透電）</p>

<p>對侵略國不恤卑躬屈節　挫弱國聯危害世界和平</p>
<p>（倫敦）英政府之準備贊助對意制裁之取銷、國內外迎拒者不一其詞、國會工黨已發表宣言書昭吿全國、題曰、「一大背叛」內稱、英國以榮譽與深切信念所擁護之國聯、今已處於重大危險中、政府今主張限制國聯之任務、此種殃害性之政策、將鼓勵條的之破裂與新侵略行爲、宜言書末懇善意之男婦敎會與其他機關團結一致、主張由國聯保衛集體安全和平與公道、</p>

<p>泰晤士報評論政府宣布其决議之下院辯論、謂輿情固當向政府完善之領導要求維持和平、並限制國聯目下所遭挫折之後患、此决辯論使閣員負有實施建設性的外交政策之更重責任、晨報謂政府毅然放棄制裁政策、復獲表率之地位、英國在努力使國聯運用中所失之威望、因此可漸恢復、每日電報謂艾登首自承認國聯失敗之恥辱、惟渠所引起之道德、爲此一筆壞債必須有以註銷之、及英國必須轉向以從事重行建設之工作、工黨議員格林武堅持已往八個月之敎訓、爲不應使國聯勢力减弱而應使之加强、特此迂論耳、彙聞報指包爾溫與艾登之態度爲「匐伏之屈服、」並謂一切事實中似毫無對此可加解釋者、每日導報謂國聯事務大員前所發「吾人不應畏縮」之一言、今已變爲「吾人應勸人人畏縮」矣苟非閣員覺悟彼等所抱背叛國聯並貶損英國名譽之願望、國人不與相同。則尙有較投降墨索里尼更惡劣之事接踵而至、每日郵報謂國聯從此將消滅於怨恨詈駡之中、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>上海猶太學校位於公共租界西區西摩路五四四號、該校規模宏大、設備完善、本文承該校校長所羅門女士多方供給材料、並蒙惠贈該校概況一册、至爲感謝、</p>
<p>一·遠東最大的猶太學校</p>
<p>上海猶太學校創辦於西歷一九零二年、創辦的目的是在供給猶太兒童一種健全的教育、可使他们能够適應生活的鬥爭、成爲自尊的青年男女和良好的公民、該校最初是在虹口一所平房內上課、那時入學的兒童不足十人、所教的課程只有英文和希伯萊文、後來該校逐漸發展擴充、到了一九三零年、全校學生人數已經增加到一百人左右、但是校舍狭小、設備簡陋、而學生人數非常衆多、所以工部局認爲頗有危險、常希望該校　移、</p>
<p>這時、適有一位英人名拍萊（Isaac　S.Perry）的去世、拍成在遺囑中指定捐助白銀十五萬兩、以爲建築猶太學校新校舍的用途、但須僑滬猶太人民籌到相等數目的欵項、以作維持學校的基金、不久、維持學校的基金乃經猶太人民籌着、於是在西摩路猶太人會堂旁邊五四四號購得校基一方、動工興建新校舍、一九三一年新校舍落成、全校學生乃　入新校舍上課、</p>
<p>新校舍係猶太人工程師剛達氏（C．H．Gonda）設計、監造、全部校舍可以代表遠東最新式的一所學校、一切清潔與衛生設備均屬新式、各處走廊及各級教室都很寬大、而且光亮通風、據該校校長說、有许多公私立學校建造校舍時、常派人到該校參觀、藉資取法、全部校舍可容學生三百人、是遠東最大的猶太學校、該校現有中學、小學、幼稚園三部、男女兼收、共有學生約二百五十人、尚有許多僑居華北或外國的猶太人子弟、亦願進入該校求學、</p>
<p>二·校舍與設備</p>
<p>該校校舍係口字形、共分二層、全部建築均用鋼骨水門汀、頗爲堅固、校舍四週均有大門或邊門通到外面、學生進出很是便利、校舍下層進西面大門處是校長室和醫務室、左首是大禮堂、對大門一邊是學生飯廳和廚房、右首是幼稚園、低年級教室暨小學生廁所、走廊兩旁裝有沙濾水管、樓上有高年級及中學部教室、美術室、圖書室、女生針綫室、教室辦公室、儲藏室等、學生實驗室或自然室沒有、不免美中不足、音樂室倂在大禮堂合用、運動場面積長一百五十尺、闊八十五尺、有籃球塲二處、兩操塲一處、手球塲一處、大沙箱二處、教堂旁邊的空塲學生亦可利用、</p>
<p>各教室設備頗屬完美。普通教室共有九間：小學部每間教室可容學生四十五人。中學部每間教室可容學生二十五人。每間教室均通走廊。而且多半朝南。光綫均自左邊射入。黑板均装在教室中光綫集中的一面。各教室全用鋼窗。且可三處開關。中間有直式窗門二扇。上下有橫式氣窗各一扇。所以在嚴冬的天氣。都可開窗通氣。而不致使學生傷風。窗簾採用自動捲簾及珠簾二種。</p>

<p>— 孔祥熙</p>
<p>上海虬江碼頭，將於六月二十日舉行奠基禮，並刊行特刊，執事者請為導言。餘惟虬江碼頭之創始，與夫歷年籌備之經過，董其事者，述之詳矣，不待余之賢言；惟當茲奠基伊始，籍願述所感，以諗國人。吾國自通商以遠，梯航畢集，各輪船公司於浦江兩岸設碼頭以為輪舶停泊之所，蓋數十年於茲。而以江上狹水淺，起卸貨物甚感不便，虬江碼頭築成，則貨物之運輸存儲至便；則因以發展吾海外商業不難矣，其於吾國國際貿易前途，所關甚鉅。此余所為慰幸者一也。上海繁榮，悉萃於租界區域，而市區日就衰落。自市政府成立繁榮大上海計劃以來，逐步推行，則工商之發展，其首事焉；碼頭成立，則其有助於工商業之發展，為益匪淺，所裨於大上海之繁榮者實大。此余所為慰幸者二也。夫交通建設事業，為近年來政府最注重之設施，以其與他種事業有密切之關係；年來政府設立中央信託局，實業部創辦各工廠市場；然此數者，均非繁於交通不可；碼頭之設立，實為一般工商業所託命；是碼頭成立，所輔助於國營事業者尤大。此余所為慰幸者三也。而執事者數年籌備之艱苦，各方之赞助，以促進斯舉之成功，尤余所為欣感者也。今以奠基之日，特述所感如上。邦人君子，幸賜教焉！</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>在昔鐵路輪舶未興，凡商業繁盛地方之特徵，為「檣桅林立」，是知水上運輸交通，關係於城市之發展者由來已久。自有鐵路以來，陸地上始有任重致遠之工具，於是僻壞腹地，亦有以形勢物產等關係，蔚為巨鎮者，例如德之柏林，旣不沿海，亦非巨浸弘流所經，徒以鐵路樞紐之故，遂成世界最大都會之一。惟水道運輸，較之鐵路，論其迅捷，固有遜色；若言經濟，則佔優勢。故雖在輸軌交錯之區，水道運輸，赤不可偏廢。例如柏林每年輸入二千五百萬公鐓之貨物中，經由運河而來者，不下一千萬公鐓。至於重洋交通所集之實海地點，卽所謂調海港所在之處，則水上運輸，尤為工商業發展上生命線；其重要性，較之聯絡背陸之鐵路運輸，當有過之而無有及矣。</p>
<p>上海市地扼吾國最大航行河道之口，與海洋相距甚近；其天然狀況，適於形成深水港，揚子流域一百九十四萬方公里之地面，因有天然之屏障，幾全部以此為貨物呑吐之口岸。此外吾國南部之商業，亦因香港與上海間沿海商埠之背陸及吃水等天然限制，大半均經過上海。又吾國北部，因地勢關係，無一深水港口，可資利用，所有商務亦以上海為中心。故上海市對於海洋交通，其他位可稱特殊優越。</p>
<p>再就內河交通而言，由上海溯揚子江而上，以達漢口，航道優美，可通行之船舶，冬季為吃水三公尺左右者，夏季為吃水九公尺左右者，自漢口以上，夏季可用特種船隻航行一千三百公里，其他較大支河，大半均適於沙船及小輸之行駛，各支河附近通商口岸之進出貨物，成集中於上海。故上海市對於內河交通，其他位亦稱特殊優越。</p>
<p>由上所述，則上海之由蓑爾縣城，發展而成人口三百五十萬之都會，為吾國最大商埠，為世界十商港之一，夫豈偶然？然使當初無黃浦江之疏浚，與碼頭方船等之設備，則水運之利不著，決不能於數十年間，由零落之漁村，一躍而成今日繁盛之市區。於此，可知一地工商來之振興除繁乎天然形勢與地利外，更有賴於人力之建設。</p>
<p>上海現有之碼頭設備，固為前此繁榮之基礎；然以與歐美近代海港比較，猶多遜色。尤以水陸運輸缺乏聯絡，使貨物經上鐵路由內地集中，或向內地分散，雖收迅速經濟之效，為一大缺點。次則深水碼頭深達最低潮位下九公尺（三十英尺）以上者，運浦東浦西並計，其總長度僅約三千一百餘公尺。試就歐洲大海港之一之漢堡港觀之，則供海舶停靠之碼頭長度不下三萬五千公尺。由此可知，以現有上海碼頭之長度論，亦不足以應發展之需要。近數十年來上海之碼頭設備，殊無顯著改進；時至今日，茍仍故步自封，則長此以往，誠有如民國十年上海港口技術顧問委員會報告書所云：「設改良工程不行，則吃水較深之輪船，勢必為外國分發中心地點所吸引，而上海將降為二等商埠；是不但本埠之利益大受損失，其影響且及於全國焉！」</p>
<p>故欲保持與增進上海之繁榮，關於水上運輸之新建設，卽碼頭設備之擴充與改良，實不容或緩。愛有聞開吳淞商港之規劃。顧茲事體大，非短期間內所能實現，乃由中央銀行投資，與辦虬江碼頭之建策；將來落成後，上海深水碼頭之長度可增加一千四百於公尺，卽就第一期工程而論，亦可增加八百八十公尺，對於道路鐵路之聯絡，倉庫貨棧等設備，亦經籌劃週到，其有裨於上海與國內外各處間運輸經濟狀況之改營，自不持言。運輸費之減輕，足以促進工商業之發展，亦可間接增加市區之繁榮；市中心區與虬江碼頭相距伊遠，為最後近之背陸；其嚴談日上之發展，吾俏媚可拭拭目以俟之也！</p>

<p>— 宋子良</p>
<p>民國十十三年春，中央銀行為發展國際貿易，扶助國營事業及促進上海市區之繁榮計，決議與建虬江碼頭倉庫，以利運輸。夫碼頭事業，規模宏大，工程繁贖，非羅致專門人才，共同研討，必難收幫策幫力，眔警易舉之效。孔部長有見於斯，乃月四日，受命陳健庵，葉琢堂，查聽織虬江碼頭設計（CHATLEY），劉鴻生諸先生及子良組織虬江碼頭設計委員會。二十四年五月，績聘張公擴，徐可亭兩先生為委員。是年八月，復以設計工作完竣，復奉命將設計委員會改組為建設委員會，委員人選照舊，承各委員之雅意，推予良為委員會主席。</p>
<p>溯自受命以來，瞬將兩載，責重才幹，時虞隕越，所幸時獲孔部長之指導，各委員之協助，對於碼頭工作，雖無特殊建樹，然具規模之際，愛將建築之動機，計劃大綱，以及第一期碼頭工程內容等，摘要略述於後：</p>
<h3 id="c212">虬江碼頭建設委員會主席宋子良 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>（一）建築碼頭之動機</p>
<p>上海市殷行區虬江口沿黃浦一帶邊岸，早經航業界及國聯調查團等認為一理想之碼頭區域，適宜於船塢碼頭之建築；蓋其岸綫長而直，江水深且闊，船隻往返停泊，均較黃浦其他流域為安全便利；尤以接近大上海計虹中之商業及工業中心，將來對於國際貿易之發展，進出口貨物之輾轉運輸，具有莫大關係。船隻今停泊於此，進出口時經過吳淞口外之神灘，毋需等候潮汛之漲落，卽可自由航駛。查黃浦流域之沿租界者，以江面狹窄，水量低淺，各處大小船隻廣集其中，擁擠殊甚。見重郵船航線過狹，行駛其中，尤為不便，偶一不慎，易遭不測。若虬江口設有碼頭可以停泊，則此種具有危險性及耗費時間性之航程，卽可避免，旣便貨物運輸，又呆節省費用。此以天然形勢之優越而適合地碼頭之建築也。</p>
<p>況碼頭事業，影響市面之繁榮至鉅，舉凡交通，運輸，金融，保險等，工業，咸可賴以勃興，碼頭一旦成立，市中心區之繁榮，指日可待。職是之故，遂毅然與建此碼頭。</p>
<h3 id="c213">虬江碼頭建設委員會委員張公權 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>（二）建築碼頭之計劃大綱</p>
<p>上述之土地坐落，卽黃浦四岸上字第九十號虬江口以北灘地約八百於畝，及周一三兩圖內土地約三百餘畝，經先後購買，並填高至吳淞口水準零點以上十九呎，均可作建築長約三千餘呎，闊約一千於呎，均可作建築碼頭堆棧等之用。如此廣大面積，須以預測將來當業數為標準，及不損及投資之利益為原則，至籌劃進行之系統，則以選擇其中重要地段，逐期建設，庶符合經濟之原理，而達投資之意旨。</p>
<p>碼頭全部計劃，共分三期。第一期先行建築碼頭兩座，每座長五百九十呎，可停泊最大這郵船，例如昌興輪船公司之皇後號等及大來輪船公司之總統號等均可停泊；兩層鋼骨水泥堆棧兩幢，鐵棚平棧兩幢，需要是鋼骨堆棧可隨時增至四層，鐵棚平棧可以拆除，卽以其地建築鋼骨堆棧；及辦公室，職員宿舍等。建築工程費共約需五百萬圓，地點在碼頭區城之南段，約佔會兩積二個之一；業經與工築築，約俟本年十月中盡竣，卽可開始營業。必要時，第二十剛期工程，尚擬繼續舉辦。</p>
<p>全部計劃完成，有直綫形對晨綫長約三千呎，四層鋼骨堆棧八轉，鐵棚不棧，轉；南端另業駿船港口。雖堆棧後約千呎處，卽係市奩道路綱徐道之浦西路，南北通連‘自市中心區至碼頭中段遠綠，五權路橫貫其間。碼頭區城北部，又有公共碼頭一厘，長約三百五十呎。各堆棧前碼頭甲板上，均裝有運輸貨物之機械設備，如起重機，經傳鐵道等。碼頭區城內都，沿浦西路兩旁，留有餘地，以供建設與碼頭有關之旅行社，輪船公司，轉運公司，汽車公司，旅館等代辦處之</p>
<p>上海不僅為遠東最大商埠，亦為世界十大商埠之一，其供給貨物之來源。較亞洲任何商埠為大，，水路則扼長江江之咽喉，陸路則鐵道橫貫，可與國內各大幹線聯絡，凡進口貨物，皆須出上海分配於長江流域，如南京浦口蕪湖安慶九江而達漢口，再由長江流域，分運內地，而內地及長江各埠之貨物，亦須集中於上海運輸出口。故上海為長江各省進出口貨物分配之總樞紐。綠是虬江碼頭計劃於堆棧前後敷設鐵道接通淞滬線，則與上海通車之各路如京浙平津粵漢均聯運，凡自外洋抵滬之貨物，可於船到時，卽刻卸裝車分運內地，而內地出口貨物，亦可由火車裝至虬江碼頭，卸於船上，直運外洋。無論進出口貨物，均無須落棧，不徵省時，抑且節費。此項鐵道設於堆棧後部者三條，碼頭前部者一條，由五權路口合併為一沿市中心區北部黃浦江接至淞滬綫，長約九公里。其建築費，據兩路管理局估算約需國幣七十五萬圓。此項建築費如何籌盡，如何擔負，各項工程，如何設計，現在正與該局商酌辦理。日後築成，則可收水陸聯運之效。再碼頭附近空地，面積有數千畝，在大上海計劃中，擬關為飛機場，同時並於江面規定一處為水上飛機停泊之所。日後果兩成為事實，則碼頭貨物之運輸，不僅水陸聯絡，更進而收水陸空三者聯運之效。是誠虬江碼頭唯一之特點，不僅遠東各碼頭所不及，抑且成為世界最優良碼頭之一也。</p>
<h3 id="c214">虬江碼頭透視圖 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>關於輪船之給水設備，碼頭與堆棧之消防工作，以及治安清潔等問題，本埠現有各碼頭設備均欠完善，尤以對於旅及接送人等之便利，更未注意。虬江碼頭則不然，處處顯慮周詳，設備完善，旅客往返與貨物運輸路徑，分別隔開，兩不相擾。有接待室，以供旅客及接送人等這休息。其中並設有商店，兼售飲食，及我國著名出品，以便旅客之購買。外如蹽望台，海關行李與護照查驗處，停車間，警局，及問訊處等等，無不應有盡有。總之旅客之住留或往返莫不予以十分便利。</p>
<p>（三）第一期計劃工程內客。</p>
<p>適當虬江口沿黃浦以北，長約一千五百餘呎，本築一直綫形之大碼頭一廛；因中段暫設駁船港口長二百二十呎，故岸綫向內凹進，遂將碼頭形成兩座。沿駁船港口，即兩碼頭之中，為二層辦公室一幢，上層碼頭辦公處，下層海關查驗所及旅客接待室。辦公室南北兩旁，各有二層鋼骨推棧一幢。此外南北兩端，為二幢幾栩不機。向西後部，為平斷堆貨曠場，四周惟以道路。住宅宿舍，設於全部區城之西南角。茲將設計之各項工程，詳述於下：</p>
<p>（甲）碼頭。</p>
<p>碼頭分兩座，每座長五百九十呎，下部填打木橋，上部用鋼骨水泥製造，木橋打於平均水平綫之下，不敢易於腐爛。碼頭甲板開五十呎，置有一切停泊設備，下有距離五十呎間之停泊檔，並有橫木檔，以供駁船之停泊。甲板上有旋轉起重機等，下面另造低層甲板，以便潮水低落時，小船及駁船仍得照常工作。</p>
<h3 id="c215">虬江碼頭建設委員會委員陳行 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>（乙）堆棧。</p>
<p>（1）鋼骨堆棧。</p>
<p>鋼骨堆棧兩幢，係固定性之建築，下部打以一百呎及九十呎長之木樓，上部用鋼骨水泥製造，基礎備為四層建築。惟目前衹建兩層，其餘兩層擬俟將來營業擴充時，再行添造，如此，不特節省開辦費用，且於加高建築時，亦不致重打基礎，而礙原有二層堆棧之用。生幢堆棧長二百二十呎，寬一百三十呎，上層為貨物長期寄存，而下層則為貨物短期寄存之用。</p>
<p>（2）鐵棚平棫。</p>
<p>鐵棚平棧兩幢，係臨時性之建築，為貨物短期寄存之所。每幢長二百二十呎，闊八十呎，有橋梁三架，直通碼頭甲板。如遇建築固定之鋼骨堆棫時，可將鐵棚平棧拆除，移裝於後部應用，其地位即為建築鋼骨堆棧，因目前尚未確知營業範圍，取其價廉而易於移動，拆除另裝，亦無過大之損失。倘過五六百呎長之郵船停於碼頭時，碼頭甲板上旋轉起重機，可將船上之前艙貨物，吊至鐵棚前；後艙貨物，吊至鋼骨堆棧之任何一層收貨平台上，然後再將貨物分別以長短期寄存性質，各為備藏，不獨手續敏捷，亦且經濟運費。</p>
<h3 id="c216">虬江碼頭建設委員會委員徐堪 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>（3）堆棧容積及內外運貨設備。</p>
<h3 id="c217">虬江碼頭建設委員會委員葉琢堂 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>全部堆棧現有容積，約一萬五千噸。堆棧外碼頭甲板上，置有軌起重機，得將貨物由船艙中，直接吊至鋼骨堆棧之任何一層，無須經人工搬運。堆棧前檢驗貨物處，有複式直綫起重機，得將堆棧下層之貨物，直接吊至上層。所有起重機計有起重運貨車四輛，斜滾車二輛一噸及六噸活動升降機汽車各一輛，滾貨滑車一百五十隻，必要時，添置一噸及十噸半旋轉起重機各數架。堆棧內後部。裝有電梯。故堆機內部，可以維持單程交通。</p>
<p>（丙）辦公室。</p>
<p>辦公室位於堆棧之中間，高兩層，長二百二十呎，劍骨水泥磚瓦建造，上層為碼頭辦公室，下層依照海關新章規定，辦為海關查驗所及旅客接待室。建於沿邊岸之碼頭中心，以其扼碼頭交通行政管理之重心，營業上似較便利也。</p>
<p>（丁）職員住宅宿舍。</p>
<p>職員住宅宿舍，建於碼頭區城之西南端與碼頭堆棧等距離並不遙遠。工程包括碼頭經理住宅一幢，碼頭監工住宅兩幢，海關查驗員住宅兩幢，職員宿舍一座，可容四十人，及兩開間二層房屋六幢，一開間二層房屋十二幢。</p>
<p>（戊）堆貨曠場及道路。</p>
<p>堆棧等之後都，繩為堆貨曠場，約有面積二十五萬七千四百平方呎，分成長方形地九方，每方四週圍有道路，暫供笨重而不受氣候關係之貨物堆積之用，將來備作建築堆棧之基地，道路係以堅實之煤層舖築。</p>
<p>（已）交通路綫。</p>
<p>市區公共道路之系統中，規定有兩大幹綫。一係南北綫形，為浦西路，自楊樹浦　起，沿黃浦西岸，經碼頭後部約離一千呎處，卽在碼頭綫與軍工路中間南北平行，至吳淞止。一係東西綫形，為浦西路，自楊樹浦起，沿黃浦西岸，經碼頭後部約離一千呎處，卽在碼頭綫與軍工路中間面北平行，至吳淞止。一係東西綫形，為五權路，自第一期碼頭使用地之北端邊岸起，橫貫軍工路，直達市區中心。其他與五權路東西平行者，有翔殷路，海蓉路，及海塘路。各公共道路，除五權路市中心區至軍工路之一段，早經築通，及軍工路至碼頭區域現在建業外；其餘尚未建設，而浦西路碼頭區域之一段，在第一期碼頭工程完成時，卽凝與造，各路綫之路面，均計劃以柏油築成，面積寬闊。其中以五權路及浦西路為尤甚。</p>
<h3 id="c218">虬江碼頭建設委員會委員查德利 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>碼頭後部至浦西路之地位，第一期工程內，經已設有煤屑路綱，即上述之堆貨曠場邊道路，其中較大之一條，直接北部大門，與五權路貫通。故五權路為碼頭陸上交通之要道。而該路之建薇，可與第一期碼頭工程同時完工。</p>
<p>碼頭開始營業時，碼頭區域交通路綫有三，（一）自五權路折入軍工路，以達楊樹浦路；（二）自五權路經市中心區轉入其美路，以達狄思威路；（三）自五權路經市中心區轉入江灣路，以達北四川路。該三路綫，汽車行駛時間，均不滿二十分鐘，可稱極為便利。</p>
<h3 id="c219">虬江碼頭建設委員會委員劉鴻生 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>以上所述，均係建築碼頭之計劃槪要。全部工程秋間可以告竣。碼頭唯一之特點，即為碼頭擬敷設鐵道接通淞滬綫，及碼頭附近空地可以建築飛機場，設日後均成事實，則水陸空聯運兼而有之。旅客之乘載，貨物及郵件等之運輸，省時節費，國際貿易，因是增進，國計民生，兩有裨益。是則虬江碼頭日後不僅可執達東各碼頭之牛耳，即進而與世界各大碼頭相碩頄，亦無遜色，此吾人所可預期者。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者，黃浦江上下遊之一切航運設備，對於我國工商業之發展，具有深切關係，必須由國人自為以營，縝密管理，庶可日新月異，力謀發揚；虬江碼頭之興磕實其嚆矢也。</p>
<h3 id="c220">虬江碼頭在我國國際貿易上之地位 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 郭乘文</p>
<p>碼頭事業與國際貿易，關係至為密切。蓋碼頭設備優良，則貨物起卸便利，不僅可以節省時間，亦可減低費用，因之大宗貿易乃於招致，現在世界各商業　發達國家，均莫不在各商埠中建設完備之碼頭，以便利出入口貨物之裝卸。</p>
<p>上海為我國貿易中心，全國出入口貿易百分之五〇以上，均集中於上海，國內士貨轉口貿易百分之四〇左右，亦為上海所獨占，由此可見上海實為我國國內外貿易之最大埠頭，貿易旣稱繁盛，碼頭事業亦頗為發達，據上海港口大全（民國二十三年）所載，黃浦江浦東浦西兩岸灘地共計二五三·四七五英尺，其中用作普通貨碼頭者計三八·七七〇英尺作特別貨碼頭者計二七·四四〇英尺，作船廠者計一三·〇二五英尺，作道路及公共或海關埠頭者一九·二五五英尺，作工業用灘岸者計二七·四八〇英尺，作河浜者計五·五三五英尺，其餘一二一·九七〇英尺，則為未開闊之灘地，主要碼頭及船廠共約一百處以上。但上海碼頭雖較我國其他各埠為發達，然性質未臻健全，設備亦未完備，應付目前需要，不免捉襟見肘，更難言乎促進將來貿易之發展，就性質方面而言，現在上海碼頭之最大缺點，一為國人自營之碼頭過少，碼頭事業幾完全操於外人之手，據調查浦東浦西兩岸碼頭（包括船廠在內）共約九十二處，其中屬於我國政府者計一五處，屬於我國商人私有計一九處，兩共三十四處，約占上海碼頭總數三分之一強，其餘三分之二，則為英日美法各國所有，且我國所經營碼頭，除招商局及三北公司所經營者外，其餘則多為設備簡陋之小碼頭，或僅裝卸煤炭之用，規模還不若外人所經營者勢力之雄厚，則其結果，貨物之裝卸自不免受外人之操從，二為公營碼頭過少，大部均係私營，上海九十二處之中，屬我國政府所經營者（包括招商局經營之碼頭鐵路碼頭市政府碼頭等）亦僅十五處，屬公共租琉璃瓦工部局所有者，不過二處，合計為十七處，僅占碼頭總額百分之一八，由此可知上海碼頭，大部份均為私人所有，此種私營碼頭過多　，不僅起卸費用及手績難收劃一之功，且費用亦常高昂直接影響於商品這運輸成本，間接卽影響於貿易之發展。</p>
<p>附黃浦江東西兩岸重要碼頭國籍分類表</p>
<p>其次就設備方面而方，上海各碼頭實未能充分盡便利貨物裝卸之功用，上海現有之碼頭，尚不能容頭等外洋船隻之停靠，據上海港口大全所載，上海碼頭足供二十八尺吃水之船停靠者長約一萬英尺，供三十尺吃水之船停靠者，更不過長六千英尺，但太平洋之商業，將來必資吃水較深之船舶為之載運，大型輪船吃水之深當達三十三英尺，是則上海碼頭之不足應付大型輪船停卸之需要，實彰彰明甚，至於碼頭上各種設備，更多簡陋，考碼頭設備之最重要者，厥為起得機，輕便鐵道，駁船及貨棧等，上海各碼一頭中，其敷設有輕便鐵道者，可調絕無，起重機等，機械，設備亦殊感缺陋，其他如駁船貨棧等設備，亦未臻完美，要之我人如欲發展上海及我國之對外貿易，則碼頭實有改進這必要，此無可譯言者也．</p>
<p>去年五月動工虬江碼頭，在我國商埠史上實入一異彩，該碼頭將於本年工竣，其性質，設備，管理，及位置等，均甚為完美，不愧為我國最大之碼頭，將來對於上海本埠之繁榮與我國國際貿易之發展，均具有莫大之功用，自對外貿易方面觀察，虬江碼頭之特色約有六端：</p>
<p>一　虬江碼頭為我國國營之最大碼頭　考虬江碼頭為中央銀行所經營，故虬江碼頭不僅為我國自營之碼頭，且為我國國營之碼頭，碼頭旣屬國營，則其目的，純在促進商埠及貿易繁榮，並非為本身而謀利，因之不僅其費用可較其他碼頭為低廉，且河供經各種新式之碼頭設備，以便利商貨之裝卸，凡私人碼頭之不能舉辦者，虬江碼頭均可倡導為之。</p>
<p>二　虬江碼頭為上海浦面闊。水量深之大碼頭。上海各碼頭因水道關係，鉅大輪船進出多須等待潮水，虬江碼頭們於虬江口，岸線平直，浦面最闊，水量最深，任何巨輪進出，不須等待潮水，拌可免除各種危險，安然停舶，時間及費用，均可以節省，因之效率可以提高。</p>
<p>三　虬江碼頭為地位最優良之碼頭　虬江碼頭位在上海市殷行區之虬江口，面萬黃浦，西連市中心區，接近上海計盡中之工商業區，將來市中心日益發達，大上海計盡逐步完成，則該碼頭交成為市中心區之出納口，殆無疑義，考碼頭建設之主要原則，即不僅其地位須能應付目前之需要，更須能適應將來之發展，虬江碼頭殆二者兼而有之，故一九三二年國聯工程專家考察上海商港時，亦認為虬江口與新市區密近，為建造郵船及其他商輪碼頭之理想地位。</p>
<p>四　虬江碼頭為我國設備最完備之碼頭　虬江碼頭目前計有鋼骨水泥碼頭二座，長度各為五百九十公尺，可停舶世界來滬之最大巨文輪，兩碼頭之間，則建有駁船港，大小駁船，均舶於此，碼頭上建有堆棧二座，及鐵棚平棧二座，共可容納貨物一萬五千噸，兩棧之中，再建有各種辦公處休息室等，上海碼頭之備有辦公處者，尚以虬江碼頭為嚆矢，堆棧之外，則裝有特大起重機若干架，船中笨重貨物，可由該機吊至堆棧之任何一層，堆棧中之貨物，亦可吊至船上貨船，無須工人搬運，裝卸至為迅速，此项起重機，在本埠尚屬創舉，此外于堆栈前後均敷設輕便鐵道直接輸送至運貨車，然後轉運至各內地，此項設備，亦為上海前所未有。</p>
<p>五　虬江碼頭運輸逕路繁多，交通便利　碼頭之能否繁榮，大部視腹地之是否豐富深廣以為定，而碼頭背後之腹地，其範圍大小，又恒視連貫此腹地以通達碼頭之運輸經路之多寡以為斷，運輸經路愈多者，則運輸必愈敏捷，費用亦愈低廉，虬江碼頭位於市中心區之前，不僅與市中心區最為密通，卽與特區交通，亦極端便利，由特區至碼頭，不須十十分鐘，此外該碼頭更擬在堆棧後部敷設鐵路三條，與淞滬路接執，與京浙贛平津隴海各路，均可實行聯運，貨物無須堆棧，卽可聯運各地，在水運方面，亦可由碼頭直接卸裝航行江海各輪駛赴各埠，無論水道陸路均極為便捷，於時間及費用方面，均可大為節省，將來該碼頭之成為我國貨物裝卸最稱便利之一碼頭，固可計日而待也。</p>
<p>六　虬江碼頭為最能適應將來發展之碼頭　現在為世界經濟時代，商務發展，一日千里，上海旣為太平洋一商業中心，則其將來發展，自未可限理，因之碼頭設備，亦宜預備將來隨時應需擴充之餘地，然後始能維持永久之繁榮。虬江碼頭面積共有一千一百餘華畝，現在動用地畝尚不過三分之一強，餘地甚多，將來發展，自無問題，在碼頭建設方面，目前碼頭二座共計為一千一百八十公尺，可停舶五百公尺以上巨輪兩艘，今後第二步預定步驟，卽將碼頭展長至三千公尺，同時可以容納世界五百公尺以上之巨輪六艘停舶，堆棧現有二所，將來擬建築至八座，鐵棚平棧亦擬加築至三座，此外拌擬建築旅行社輪船公司轉運公司及旅館等等，以期充分供給商運以各種利便。</p>
<p>以上所舉虬江碼頭特色六端，在在均與我國國際貿易之繁榮，息息相關，將來該碼頭完成，我國商運必日越便捷，行見上海及我國對外貿易，將因虬江碼頭之完成而得一新的助力，是則吾人於虬江碼頭舉行奠基典禮之時，可斷言也。</p>

<p>— 陳膽星</p>
<p>這社會的每一陰暗角裏，都被寄着綱陷阱。靑春之火正旺盛而發生性的衝動時的年輕女子們，就無異站在深不見底的陷阱口上，成爲女子一生的最危險期，亦卽是取决畢生前途的幸或不幸的時期，猶如行舟於風狂浪大的海面，價使能有主見，有毅力，能把得住舵，便可避免危險，可造成光明而幸福的前途。假使迷感於一種美妙的誘惑，制止不住靑春之火燃燒正盛的煩悶，「一失足成千古恨』，寳貴的靑春與貞操，便不免於給披着人皮的野獸吞噬掉。</p>
<p>這社會的每一塲合上，儘多着這種披着人皮懷着獸心，專以女性的靑春與貞操爲食料的人，他們有着漂亮的儀表，說着甜蜜的話語，具有靈敏的手腕，按排下陷阱興羅網，專等着初成熟，意志未堅，處世經騐薄弱的年輕女子們傾跌下去、我們每天不是在報紙的社會新聞裏聞裏，可以看見貞操喪失的涉訟嗎！有許多年輕女子不是因爲受人之之愚而操與肉體，沾汚了聖潔的靈魂，只因顏面名譽攸關，而不敢公然宣佈，涉訟，而仍暗暗痛苦地活着，消滅了前進的勇氣的，更不知有多多少少。不論是智識皆級的，或半開化的，或完全沒有受過敎育的女子們，是不得不提防着的，若被一時情戚的驅使，毅然昂首向『愛』之路上邁進，及至罪惡造成，悲慘的結果開始，就『悔之晚矣』。</p>
<p>社交與戀愛，這兩項並不是罪惡的產物，假使能不盲從，由正當的途徑去獲得的話。然而這社會上的男與女，能澈底了解社交與戀愛的眞價値，眞意義的，究竟有多少？許多女子被虛榮紮沒着眼睛在崎嶇的路上摸索，許多女子在靑春之火燃燒到了最高點的時期，一切神經已給衝動的感淸完全佔有了。於是，便盲目地，從『社交』的方式裏，以冀找到一個對象。在這時候，便是一輩紈袴的男子，佈設陷阱的最好機關。靑年女子；請當心陷阱！</p>
<h3 id="c232">婦女需要回家庭去嗎？ <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 守眞</p>
<p>自從希持勤提出了婦女回家庭去的口號以後，一班男性社會中的異性歧門者們，馬上就好像得到了一種言論的保障似的；　吹大擂的提出了許多反對婦女運動，女子參政，以乃婦女在職業界活動的不成爲理由的理山，他們想趁這風勢中把剛剛在社會上露出頭角嫦女趕回到家庭，而把一般正在預備向社會抬起帆頭的婦女，壓伏在家庭的暗角，以保障他們的以男性爲中仆的社會壁壘。</p>
<p>本來，在中國，婦女的社會地位已是够可憐了的。雖然自婦女運動跟着五運動的高潮血湧起，會經獲得政府承認了婦女在政治上，經濟上，敎育上一切社會地位的平等，然而道僅是抬高了極少數極少數的幾個特權階級的婦女，以作表面的敷衍，實際上絕大多數的婦女，依然被窒息在廚房的樊　裏，而從來沒有看見一點光明過的，現在中國的大人先生們居然也學着時髦，叫着婦女同家庭夫，實際上他們沒看見中國的婦女們是用不到這樣費心的。</p>
<p>現在我們站在人的立場上平心靜氣的　討論婦女，是不是除了家務之外，就不能參與其他事業的活動了麼？當然家庭是社會的基礎，我們不能因社會的工作，而拋棄了家庭，但是這責任並不是女子個人而是男女雙方的。如果男不借了工作社會爲名，而完全卸了家庭的責任，僅僅在每月送一點錢到家裏就算了事，那對於所謂妻竟完全像一個僱傭了，那麽女子父何嘗不可以收到社會上去賺了錢來傭傭男子或共他以此爲職業的婦女來代她維特家庭呢？所以這種情形是决不能使婦女屈服的•</p>
<p>其决一般人總以爲女子的天性適於治家，所以女子應該在家庭裏，這也根木不是理由。假使女子不是受數千年禮敎的鎖　所束純卜的家庭環境，從小就把她們陶冶得那麽柔弱無能的話，未必她們就不是剛毅勇敢而極有作爲的，這我們拿那些文化比較低落，禮敎的力量比較薄弱的邊地區城的婦女勞動情形來作比，也就可以瞭然了·况且專實上現在的一般婦女當中，也不乏許多剛毅有爲的女子，足以充當社會工作和人類的大任的，反之男干當中却有許多是低能兒，僅知花大酒地的胡鬧，而不事生產的。</p>
<p>况且我們中國一向把婦女壓伏在家庭，無論那個工作，是如何的需要人，他們總是不願意識能幹的婦女　帮助而寗願一般低能的男子來濫竽充數，致弄得整個的社會事業，日益衰落，且因爲生產者少而消費者多，致每個家庭都感到經濟的恐慌，而形成了整個社會的經濟力薄弱，因此中國的婦女，照理是尤其需要到社會上來工作的。</p>
<p>所以依我個人的意見，一個女子如果她的能力和抱負是足够成就一種事業的那當然應該把她的能力貢獻到社會米，向社會　競爭，如果一個女子，她的力量是足够治家而有餘的，耶她除了治理家務之外，就應當史以餘力來服務社會。再如果一個女子，她的性情確是溫柔寡斷，對於社會事業也沒有興趣，那就不妨讓她安店於家庭中好了·所謂婦女回家庭去這口號，根本是無理而且不適用於中國的·</p>
<p>現在蟄居在家中的有能力有學識的婦女們，我盼望你們到社會上來，的確現代中國是需耍整個民族的力量了呵！</p>

<p>— 大千</p>
<p>婦女愛美，出於天性，亦美德也。在昔修飾之法不精，玉容老去，或禀質不麗，惟有對鏡自憐，近世凡百可用手術，於是乃有所謂美容妙法。巴黎有醫生名法沙Fassot者，舉世最有名之改造面部專家也。自其逝後（新近去世）其所用之美容方法，遂爲各地「面科醫生」之錦妙術。美國近年，已有「美容院」出現，乘時會之所趨，投女性之所好，此種組織其能免於不脛而人我國之懼乎？究之其事若何，非悉其內容，不足以下斷語，此本文之所由作也。</p>
<p>現時流行之美容美身方法，的有下列數種，其結果分述於後：</p>
<p>去而皺法　人届衰老，血液不足，面部自然生皺，與橘之擱置過久，水分蒸發，表皮生皺，同一理由，美容師所挾之去皺妙法，非將皺者塡小，枯者潤澤，而乃將鬆皺之皮割去一部是也。其法擇耳後髮盡處，（曲耳後髮之邊緣）以小刀剜　，緊拉面部之皮，俟無皺文，乃割去所鬆餘之皮，再以綫縫之，縫處在髪之邊緣，利用髮之掩蓋，不易爲人發現，然若理髮時稍有不愼，爲理髮匠修剪過短，即有水落石出之虞。某日美國。理髮店中來一婦人，盛氣與理髮匠交涉，何以將其髮修剪過短，致彼不能出而見人，理髮匠初尙不解，後乃知獲罪之由，在於癥結暴露也。此法行後，歷時不久，面部皺紋將復起，須再拉割，經數决拉割之後，面部即失原來神態，允以目之變失原形爲甚。若美容師之手術不甚高明，則往往　成雙目大小不同之怪象，求美反以助醜矣！</p>
<p>嫩膚法　嫩膚法者，去乾枯之表皮，使成嫩膚是也。現時美容師所用之方法••（甲（以枯土和水揭　濃漿，塗於膚上，俟其乾硬，然後剝去之；（乙）蠟溶漿塗於膚　，俟其冷凝　剝去之；（丙）以水草和稱料搗成　漿，塗膚上，俟其乾後剝去之。以上諸法，自塗漿後以至剝去之期間，皆有極難忍受之不適，允以蠟熱如灼爲甚，其結果則以上諸法所　得之嫩膚，爲時不過數小時之久而已。</p>
<p>燙髪　燙髪肇焚如，我國已屢有所聞，不特自燙多危險，即在理髮店中，亦不能免也。在我國理髮店中所燙之髮，且有經熱水洗滌，即仍復原形，不能持久之憾。美國燙髪術發達，所謂永久波紋，確能持久不變，工資率須美金數元，婦女所常引以爲苦者，尙不在所　太多，而在燙髪時之痛苦，蓋此種燙髪，係用一種燙髮機，婦女之髮須絞在燙髮機上，然後油燙之，常時之美人，謔者喩之爲夜又，實情亦殆不相遠！歷數小時之灼烤，始克竣事，然其所能享受之美觀，亦不通數月耳！（大率三四月）數月以後，已燙者以長而漸剪去，新者代之，又須再受十决苦矣！</p>
<p>總觀以上所謂各種美容方法，皆有大痛苦，在美會有一女子，日美容院出，有人問其美容之滋味如何１該女子率口而答曰：「阿呀天啊！美容妙法啊！」此一聲「啊呀大啊」之中，其所受之種切，可以想見！抑所謂美者，是否必須寓於修飾之中，則叉在各人之所見矣。</p>
<h3 id="c234">家庭預算問題 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>國家機關，耍有預算，商業機關，要有預算，家庭中，自然也需要有預算。家庭中立下預算，實在是一件很有意義的事，因爲有了預算，雖不能一錙一銖的花用，完全能依合理化的預算，而能完全適合於理想的度支，但多少總能因了有預算的支配，而减少些收支上的不平衡。但是我國的家庭中，也很有在開歲時，立下了一個再也合理不過的預算的，而結果，往往支出遠過於收入，而負了不少的債。其癥結之所在，自然也是相當地複雜的，但我覺得最適當的解說，莫過於瑪麗馥爾夫人，於本年二月間，在倫敦一個婦女與家庭俱樂部，所發表的演說，最爲適當</p>
<p>伊演說的題目，是「家庭預算問題」。伊說，家庭中有預算，便可以表示出這個家底中，必有一位勤儉，細心，而負責的主婦。况且每一個家庭中，編製一個預算，是很便易的，譬如在聖誔節上購置一冊來年用的日記簿•旣經購置了日記簿，便該每天把所幹的事記下來。這一件事，便得要試騐這個置備日記簿的人，有無恒心了。家庭中的預算，也是如此，旣製定了預算，便該備一冊收支的記錄簿，每天把一切收支，一項一項的記錄下來，而且應逐頁的分類，例如第一頁，是專登伙食賬，第二頁，專登衣服賬，第三員，專登書報雜誌賬，第四頁，專登醫藥賬。這種賬，雖然似乎是很繁瑣的，但是從這繁瑣的各頁中，很容易把收支情形，和預算相比較，而反省着生活的是吾合理。待到一個相當的時期屆滿時，（假定爲一年，）那麽，就可從各個專頁的總數中，比較出與預算的差額來•這種記賬的恒心，並非是毫無報酬的。第一年的决算，便是編製第二年預算的標本。換一句話說，便是第二年生活的義務家庭問題。整個家庭中的任何一人，都可依着這位義務家庭顧問的指導，而合理地把生活放弛與緊縮，以求適合於收支的平衡，以免負債的痛苦。負債這一回子事，是破壊美滿家庭，掠取家庭幸福的惡魔，但是家庭中而有一位動儉，細心，而肯負責的主婦，便能很有恒心地，編製合理的預算，使家庭中的收支相平衡，而解决一切普通家庭中所不易解决的問題。</p>
<p>筆者有幾位朋友，家中是沒有預算，也沒有每天的收支記錄的•到了年終，有的是一年辛苦，囊無餘資，有的是索性負了不少的債務。於是丈夫抱怨着妻子的不善持家，甚至於侮蔑着妻子的做着私蓄，或花着不可吿人的寃錢。自然，妻子們爲避卸自己的責任起見，也得想入非非的攻擊着丈夫的弱點，而互相水火起來•，這種問題，豈是無法解决的。我們觀於瑪麗馥爾夫人的「家庭預算問題」的演辭，覺得要解决這問題，也並不是難事。只須每一個家庭中的主婦，不憚煩地每天撥出一刻鐘的光陰來，記上幾筆靑菜豆腐賬，黑筆寫在白紙上，丈夫對於妻子，妻子對於丈夫，大家可以不再怪着對方，而或許可因這種實際的記錄，截長補短，以免却下一年的收支不平衡，而樹立下一個合理的家庭度支制度，——預算，以爲生活的準則。</p>

<p>母乳爲嬰兒天然的營養料，以母乳哺嬰兒，不但省時，且亦經濟。但因種種緣故，母親常不願自己哺乳，而多雇用奶媽；亦有用牛乳或代乳粉者。這都不免有缺點。若母親因身體有特殊原因或疾病而不能哺乳，是可以原諒的。但是普通所見，大多是摩登主婦們，怕自己哺乳損害美容，或妨礙交際，乃不願用自己的乳汁哺養可愛的嬰兒。於是伊們的小孩，遂陷入非常可憐的境遇。一般人都能知道：人體的健康，與幼時乳之營養，是很有關係的。我現在把哺母乳的益處及乳母哺或人工哺的壊處，都寫下來，爲一般沒有疾病而不願哺乳者進一忠吿。　　母乳營養的價値</p>
<p>母乳營養的價值　哺母乳有下列各種益處：　含有特種維生素，　含有特種免疫性，　溫度合宜，　因不經器具，細菌無由得入，　爲嬰兒天然之飲料。所以要使童孩健全，實以用母乳哺之爲最佳。除有肺病，心臟病，急性腎炎，或急性傳染病等，不能哺乳外，其餘都當自己哺乳，雖身體瘦弱之母親，有杵多醫生，亦勉勵其自己哺乳。（因在哺乳時代，胃口可以加增，其攝取之營養，除供乳外，每有多餘或者因此而反能肥胖强健了），若母有梅毒，更應自哺。因梅毒有遺傳性，嬰兒生下來時早受傳染，此等嬰兒若用人工哺，易發生營養障礙，若雇乳媼，悔毒可由嬰兒傳染　乳媽，故還是母親自哺，而雙方就　爲妙·亞　有矓　母義的授乳，如其工作時間爲早上九時至十二時，下午一時至五時者，那麽務授乳並沒有　礙·因母親回家午　時，可授乳，早上未上工時可授乳，晚間回家時，亦可授乳的·若工作時間特別者，亦可設法親自授乳。此外若母乳稀少，可另加人工代乳品，但絕對不可停止哺母乳。母親授乳，非但對於嬰兒有偉大的益處，即在母親亦有許多益處，如嬰兒初生哺乳，能使母親子宮速復原位，减少以後的背痛腰痠等苦患，這是可以實騐的。</p>
<p>雇用乳媼授乳的檢討</p>
<p>中國因爲女子職業不發達，生活程度較低，雇用乳媼尙不感難處，在別國，女子職業之發展，生活程度之增高，乳媼簡直不易雇得。且雇用乳媼，在道德觀點上，亦感不當，因乳母之嬰兒裏失母乳，而改用不合宜之代乳品，每易疾病而致死。我們試想，乳媼犧牲其自己親生的子女性命，來換取少數之金錢，而一般身體健康的主婦，反不願自哺，是吾違悖人道。更有進者，哺乳亦有神經關係，乳媼多半爲無智識者，嬰兒長大後，其智慧，性情，習慣，每像無智識的奶媽，聰明伶俐的母親呀！你們得到如此的孩子，或許還不知道道是什麽原因啊！此外乳媼對於小主人，往往用欺騙手段，如小主人哭了，立即就給乳吃等，更易養成嬰兒的古怪脾氣，所以除在不得已的時候，凡母體健康者，總以想法以自己哺乳爲是。</p>

<h3 id="c237">陸禮華女士談婦女現勢 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>中國人已經够苦了，而女人要比男干苦，允其自身奮鬥而能爲社會工作的女子，在現階段的環境裏，那眞是苦得異乎尋常的了。……這幾句話，是陸禮華女士的經騐之談。陸女十辦理女子體育事業，垂十七年之久，她嘗過了社會上種種甜酸苦辣的味道，依然能沉着苦幹，平心而論，這副精神，是不可磨滅的•前幾大她正從香港回來，我們碰見了，隨便談天而談到了婦女問題，她的意見，很可以使一般人同情的。</p>
<p>樹獨立精神</p>
<p>我國數千年來，重男輕女的積習太深，對女子無理　壓迫，至今不能　除　净。近二十年中女子盡絕大的努力，雖已爭得法定的地位，但實際上女子所受約束太多，離平等的階段還遠哩•以目前論，國內女子有學識技能的，爲　不少，而尙不能出其所學，全部貢獻於社會國家，這是很可惜的。依今日之時勢，女子是應該抬頭的，其先决條件，必以健全體格爲基礎；勤求學問，堅强意志，樹獨立精神，當然也很緊要的。男女平權，除女子本身努力外，還望男子尊重女性，隨時取扶持的態度，醫如學孩學步，必須成人扶持一樣。如果男女的本能達到水準的時候，我相信小四家庭减輕負擔，增進幸福，大　社會勞役共同盡力，國家建設，事半功倍，並非過甚之詞。</p>
<p>一般的缺憾</p>
<p>處理家政原爲女於應盡的責任但不司只顧家事而忽略社會的工作，應分其餘力，爲公衆服務，就是治家，我主張月經濟的，合理的，藝術的方法，改善過去不良的習慣。有許多家庭主婦，　家沒有修理，看她一天忙到晚，吃盡辛苦，以客觀的眼光來看，依然雜亂無章，毫無頭緒。如能應用科學的方法，那一天的工作，做半天就成了。女子最大的缺點，便是眼光短淺，氣量狹窄，缺少曠達樂觀的心理。所以在家往往爲些微小事，爭論反目，在外服務，彼此顧忌，不能敬業樂羣，一經旁人說長道短，便轉移意志，自生煩惱，這些反常的情節，要力求避免。夫婦之道，以平等待遇爲原則，倘男以女爲低能，生卑視之心；女以男爲萬能，長依賴之念，家庭必無幸福可言。我以爲「尊敬■與「十諒解」，爲愛情的要素，不獨夫婦如此，待人接物，何獨不然。</p>
<p>遠東的女性</p>
<p>在遠東方面，陸女士曾至過不少地方，我請她對各地女性作　括的批評。她稅：「我所到之處，不過　時勾留，未有深切認識，姑就所見，試述：在國內，覺得江浙婦女，得文明風氣之先，物質享受比各地爲優，性質柔弱，膽略較羊華中女性頗勇敢，尤其湘省女子，都有前進的精神；華北婦女有堅苦耐勞的美德；華南以地勢關係，又爲海外僑胞出入的總樞，所受刺激較深，模仿歐化及參加職業的機會較多，故情形與各地不同。如港粵職業婦女的訓，堪與日本媲美，我曾仔細體察過，深信她們都能尊重自己，爲服務而服務的。國外方面：如日木女子，極馴服耐苦，在職　界頗有勢力，婦女集團，很有强力組織，惟在在仰男子鼻息，公民　格較爲低落。五年前會游朝鮮，亡國景象，十分悽慘！他們受了奴隸敎育，泯滅了國族觀念，簡直談不到什麽婦女問題。南洋羣島如菲列濱的婦女敎育，非常普及，男女也絕對平等；女子服務效率甚高，女界也很有聯絡，我參觀菲島的婦女大會，到五十餘單位委員，代表全體五千餘人，氣象蓬勃，令人敬佩。荷屬東印度，對女干特別恭敬，醫如女了歐打了男人，那男人無法起訴，反之男人必受重罰，據說荷印社會，處處表示尊重女性，這大概因爲荷蘭楚女皇的關係吧。英法屬地的土人，雖在半開化的時期，而男女却有守全平等的模樣。」</p>
<p>婦女與體育</p>
<p>她又說一婦女問題，所以至今不能　盤解决者，體育冒爲重大核心。我爲此犧牲了個人一切　幸福，任勞任怨，以辦理女子體育事業爲一貫的方針。回想十七年中，不知遭遇幾許挫折，但始終不因阻難而灰心，幸而國人對女，體育，己有相當的認識。從今以後，我主張女子體育不限於學校，應由學校推廣到家庭與社會方面去，擴大施行，收效必宏。體育是多方面的，與醫學，衛生，有相五的關係，三者打成一片，人生繼能享受他康的幸福。我們要把體育的分量，分配於日常生活中間，盼望全國婦女，從事體育，努力體育，造成濃厚的空氣，掃盡數千年來女子文弱的汚點，到那時候，自然整個的婦女問題，迎刃而解了。」</p>
<h3 id="c238">獨身主義之錯誤（上） <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 月心</p>
<p>—獻給獨身思想的姊妹們—</p>
<p>獨身主義的思想是錯誤的：這是誰也應當承認。爲什麽呢，所謂「獨身」，解釋起來就是不與異性結合。我們知道一切生物大都是由兩性的結合而繁殖其種子延長其生命，生物單獨的生命是短促得很，倘使以前的死了，以後的不會生長出來，那末世界上將沒有一種有生命的東西，因爲一個生物不能抓得住永遠的生存，於是由於天生的兩性相合而新生一個新的生命，這樣跟看時間的流動而一天天繼續下去。</p>
<p>以人來講，那更是重要：；人是天生兩性的動物，由於兩性的需要而結合而賦與新的動力及繁殖種族，這是天賦人類的本能。不過人是知識最高的動物，對於兩性的結合並不是隨他選擇的，在選擇異性的一點上是常常要遇着許多　觀的困靴的，由於這種困難的發生，於是所謂「獨身」的這種思想便乘機而入了。不過獨身思想的由來，原因也很多，大槪分起來有下面幾種：</p>
<p>（一）受到失戀或婚姻上的困難！</p>
<p>在我們這樣一個新舊思想衝突的時代，資本與封建並存的社會，對於婚姻一項是一個最不容易解决的問題；許多的女性都葬身於婚姻的困難上，有許多女子個性雖然很强，但伊沒有勇氣去打破現實的困難。在這個時候伊忽然發現了一條道路——獨身主義的道路。伊以爲這條路是終身使伊自由自在，再不會受婚姻的痛苦了。</p>
<p>（二）爲了完成自己的事業—</p>
<p>有的女子往往以爲做一件事情必須毫無阻力，議伊一點沒有妨害地去完成，於是伊太熱心於事業，對於婚姻置之不顧了。伊覺得這樣才能達到目的，才能發展自已。</p>
<p>（三）看破世情以爲人生不過如此—</p>
<p>結婚生孩子是一件多麽痛苦而麻煩的事呵！有的獨身女子一定這樣想，他們的思想是近於頹廢的；伊們看到許多女子悲痛的痕跡，看到許多爲失戀而自殺的女子，以爲異性是一種可怕的東西。同時伊們想到人生的快樂悲苦完全是一種空的東西，因此覺得還是一僩人自山自存的過生活吧。</p>

<h3 id="e7">President Jiang Speaks to Western Reporters About National Assembly and Presidential Election <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Firmly Declares He Has Absolutely No Desire to Be a Presidential Candidate</p>
<p>Because He Needs to Travel Throughout the Country for On-Site Inspections of Public Sentiment and Political Achievements</p>
<p>(Local News) The Shen Shi News Agency translates from the North China Daily News, stating that the North China Daily News reported on the 19th that their reporter visited Chairman Jiang yesterday and discussed the National Assembly's presidential election in November. Chairman Jiang firmly declared that he has absolutely no desire to be a presidential candidate, and stated that the purpose of convening the National Assembly is to allow all citizens to participate in politics, jointly take responsibility for saving the country, and collectively resolve national crises. The Chinese Nationalist Party believes that national unity is essential for national revival, so it has decided to convene the National Assembly, promulgate a constitution, return political power to the people, and have the people elect a government to replace the party rule during the period of political tutelage. This is the public will of the party, and no one in the party has even considered the issue of president, etc. Only a group that can take responsibility, abide by discipline, and is willing to sacrifice all personal power, position, and self-interest, and eliminate selfish and self-serving ideas, can revive the country. When the reporter asked for the reasons for his unwillingness to be a presidential candidate, Chairman Jiang explained in detail as follows:</p>
<p>"At this unprecedented time in the nation's history, I believe that every citizen should do their best to use their individual strengths to benefit the country. I believe that the position of president will prevent me from fulfilling my aspirations to serve the country, because my greatest contribution to the country is to be able to travel to all parts of the country, no matter how remote, to conduct on-site inspections of local public sentiment and political achievements, and to resolve various issues fundamentally related to national revival, such as improving the military, improving education, economic construction, rural relief, and transportation development, so that all government orders are not delayed or stalled. I am confident that to maximize my ability to serve the country, it is essential that I am not restricted by a fixed position. This is extremely necessary. In the past two or three years, wherever I have been, due to my personal contact with provincial authorities and local people, these places have made greater progress than before. This is evidenced by my experience and the facts. This kind of on-site contact can eliminate various difficulties and misunderstandings, and clarify the country's overall policy to the people, in order to establish a foundation for a century-long plan. It can enable compatriots in all regions to recognize the country's unity and wholeness, and promote national unity and loyalty to the central government to jointly save the country. If I am appointed to the position of president, I will not be able to continue such extensive tasks, because the president must reside in the capital and cannot easily leave. I am certain that my best effort for the construction of the new China lies in personally investigating the country's true needs and implementing them. I do not want this special contribution to be deprived by the position, so I am determined not to be listed as a presidential candidate." (Shen Shi News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 4:00 PM on the 18th, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Chen Juesheng, visited Tashiro at the Zhang Garden official residence. This was the first meeting between Tashiro and Song since Tashiro took office. At 11:00 AM on the morning of the 19th, Tashiro, accompanied by interpreter Hirai and adjutants Jinbo and Otake, returned the visit to Song at No. 131, 17th Road, British Concession. They departed after talking for about half an hour. Song originally planned to host a lunch for Tashiro, Nagami, etc. on the 19th, but it was rescheduled due to being busy. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan will inspect various counties south of Tianjin in the coming days and will return to his ancestral home of Leling in Shandong. At that time, Han Fuju will go to meet him to discuss everything. Zhu's return to Beiping is expected to be after the lunar Dragon Boat Festival. (19th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Song Zheyuan is scheduled to visit friends in Dezhou on the 20th. (19th, Special Military Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qin Dechun returned to Beiping at 9:00 PM on the 19th. Song Meicun, Chief of Staff of the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan Garrison Headquarters, arrived in Tianjin at 8:00 PM on the 19th. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Major General Imamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, arrived in Tianjin by air from Changchun at 11:00 AM on the morning of the 19th, accompanied by Senior Staff Officer Hanaya, to meet with key Japanese figures in the North China Army, including Tashiro. He will stay in Tianjin for three or four days, and then go to Beiping, Tongzhou, and Zhangjiakou for inspections before returning to Changchun via Rehe. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ishii stated that some people suspect that Itagaki's arrival in Tianjin and the meeting of the North China and Kwantung garrison headquarters indicate an intention to disrupt North China. The Japanese side has absolutely no such intention. Both the current and former commanders aim to promote the stabilization and clarification of governance in North China. The Yunian and Bai Jianwu riots, which the military headquarters assisted in suppressing, are proof of this. There have been many rumors in Beiping and Tianjin recently, with a few disgruntled individuals colluding with ronin, attempting to take advantage of the situation to pursue their own selfish desires. The Japanese military headquarters will absolutely not allow this. Imamura's arrival will not result in a special meeting, but only a small meeting of the cadre group. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military Attaché Imai of the Japanese Embassy stated that his previous trip to Nanjing and Shanghai was of a liaison nature and had no important mission. He participated in a meeting of the garrison headquarters in Tianjin and returned to Beiping last night after the meeting. The meeting of the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters was held yesterday, and the Kwantung Army did not send personnel to participate. In addition to listening to reports from military attachés from various regions, there were no important motions. The Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Itagaki's arrival in Tianjin and Hebei-Chahar diplomacy are still being discussed. China and Japan have a special status in North China. As long as all measures within Hebei and Chahar take into account this relationship of the Japanese side, the Japanese side will naturally have no dissatisfaction. The new mayor of Tianjin, Zhang Zizhong, took office yesterday, and the Japanese side has no objection. Rumors in Tianjin can gradually be extinguished. After Song arrived in Tianjin, he visited Commander Tashiro at the Japanese military headquarters and talked for about an hour, which was very harmonious. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese senior military officers from various parts of North China held a meeting in Tianjin yesterday. The content of the meeting is kept strictly confidential as usual, but it is generally believed that there must be a major decision. Imai, the Japanese military attaché stationed in Beiping, told visitors today that the meeting had concluded, and that no representatives from the Kwantung Army attended the meeting. It is expected that Song Zheyuan will soon discuss North China affairs with Shandong Chairman Han Fuju near the Shandong border. (19th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shimizu, head of the press section of the Japanese Army Ministry, went to Changchun from Japan for investigation and research and is scheduled to come to Beiping and Tianjin at the end of this month to conduct investigations in North China. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>In Peacetime, the Great Wall Is the Boundary</p>
<p>In Wartime, Close Liaison Is Adopted</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ishii, Senior Staff Officer of the North China Garrison Headquarters, stated that the North China military attaché meeting only lasted for one day and closed on the same day. There were no consultations on the 19th. The content of the meeting is not convenient for publication. It is also difficult to tell the whereabouts of key figures related to Chief of Staff Itagaki's visit to Tianjin. In peacetime, the authority of the Kwantung and North China military headquarters is bounded by the Great Wall, but in wartime, close liaison is adopted, regardless of territorial boundaries. Military actions are like twisting a button; if one is pressed, all are clear. Kwantung Army aircraft are allowed to fly to their destinations in an emergency and are under the command of the North China military headquarters. Of course, eastern Hebei falls within the scope of the North China military headquarters, but the Kwantung Army headquarters can sometimes intervene. When Song Zheyuan arrived in Tianjin, he visited Commander Tashiro on the 18th, but there was no diplomatic contact. It was not appropriate to talk deeply at their first meeting. There have been no recent negotiations on diplomatic matters, and no one from the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has come to negotiate. The Japanese army has no intention of continuing to increase troops in Beiping. The current increase in troops stationed in Beiping by two times is because the troops that previously arrived should have been stationed in Beiping, but due to the completion of the barracks, they camped along the Beining Line. Now that the barracks are completed, the camping troops will move in, and it is not a new increase in troops transferred from the country. The previous mayor of Tianjin had quite a few achievements. Although the new one lacks political experience, he has admirable qualities because of his military background and straightforward nature. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Pan Yugui Went to Tianjin Yesterday to Report to Song</p>
<p>(Beiping) The second case of theft from the Forbidden City is under strict investigation all day today. The Forbidden City held an emergency meeting this morning and examined the fingerprints of all employees in the institute. Pan Yugui went to Tianjin this morning to report to Song. According to Ma Heng, Director of the Institute, this case of theft from the Forbidden City was discovered on the afternoon of the 17th. The total number of lost antiques is seventy-one. It is said that these antiques were left behind when Feng evicted Puyi and Consort Jin from the palace in 1924 and were mostly valuable items. There is currently only one clue in the case: a fingerprint on the glass cover of a Ruyi ornament. The fingerprint team of the Public Security Bureau has been invited to the institute to examine the fingerprints of all employees to investigate. The stolen antiques include a large bronze incense burner with a diameter of one foot. The Forbidden City's gates are heavily guarded, and it is impossible for small items to be carried out at will. It must have been a collusion between insiders and outsiders that allowed them to be transported out. It has now been found that a suspect, Huang Yichang of the guard team, is a suspect. It cannot be determined yet whether he is the perpetrator. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the antiques were stolen from behind the Qianqing Palace in the Forbidden City, the institute held a meeting of important staff this afternoon and telegraphed the Executive Yuan about the incident. Ma Heng is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 20th. A certain employee of the Forbidden City, Huang, is suspected of being a thief and was arrested tonight. Qin Dechun returned to Beiping from Tianjin at 11:00 AM this morning to talk about the matter. Song was extremely angry about the theft from the Forbidden City. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After news of the theft of antiques from the Forbidden City Museum broke, reporters went to the institute on the 19th to inquire about everything. According to a person in charge of the institute, there were unexamined items stored in the room behind the screen door of the Qianqing Palace. When the antique retrieval team went to retrieve them on the 17th, they saw something was wrong and immediately withdrew. The second section of the General Affairs Department then sent a team to the site to check each item according to the inventory and found that the original items were indeed missing. The losses included twelve large and small white jade Ruyi ornaments, two green jade Ruyi ornaments, seventeen enamel watches, one coral Ruyi ornament, thirty-five folding fans, one copper incense burner, one copper incense shovel, one copper Ruyi head. In addition, the original inventory, item number 70, listed a painting of horses by Zhao Zi'ang, but now this item is missing. However, there is an unmarked scroll of painting, the center of which has been torn away, leaving only the top and bottom mounting, which may be this item. The folding fans listed on the inventory included calligraphy and paintings by Shen Huan, Nayanbao, etc. The rumor about the ancient bronze furnace should be a mistake for the copper incense burner. This matter has been reported to the Executive Yuan and the Public Security Bureau, which came to the institute on the 19th to investigate and assist in the investigation, hoping to solve the case soon. Ma Heng also convened an emergency meeting of important staff at 9:00 AM on the 19th to discuss ways to pursue the matter. Pan Yugui, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, went to Tianjin at 5:45 AM on the 19th to report to Song Zheyuan on the theft of antiques and to ask for instructions on everything.

<h3 id="e14">The Significance of Britain's Withdrawal of Sanctions <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The British Conservative Party cabinet has finally unveiled its mask and announced the removal of economic sanctions against Italy. If we clearly understand the consistent policy of the Conservative Party in the past, we would not find such a "shameful" action surprising. We know that Britain's consistent foreign policy in recent years has been to sacrifice the interests of small and weak countries within the scope of not harming its own interests and give aggressor countries considerable satisfaction. Therefore, in the minds of young diplomats in its party, such as Eden, there may be the existence of the concept of collective security, while diehards such as Sir Peevorlock and quasi-diehards such as the Chamberlain brothers, such as party leader Baldwin, fundamentally believe that collective security is a beautiful but useless term. In the eyes of these extremely influential elements in the Conservative Party, the League of Nations is a useless organization, and Britain's advocacy of sanctions is superfluous. Why should Britain cherish one Abyssinia to maintain its own security, and why should it rely on the League of Nations, this useless tool, to protect its own interests? The Conservative Party has always wanted to compromise with Italy, and before Italy and Ethiopia formally declared war, it proposed to establish a new agreement with Italy based on past clauses, sacrificing part of Ethiopia's interests to satisfy Mussolini.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Domestic Criticism Rises Against British Government's Foreign Policy <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Political Betrayal Damages National Prestige; Opposition Party Prepares to Introduce a Motion of Impeachment</p>
<p>(London) During today's parliamentary debate on foreign affairs, Labour opposition leader Attlee announced that, as a result of the government's decision to support the removal of sanctions against Italy, he would introduce a motion of impeachment against the government in the House of Commons next Tuesday.</p>
<p>When the debate began, the atmosphere in the House of Commons was extremely tense. Every seat was occupied, and the galleries were also full. When Foreign Secretary Eden announced the government's decision, he was repeatedly interrupted, and the opposition shouted slogans such as "Shameful" and "Resign." At one point, the Foreign Secretary's speech was interrupted for a full ten minutes because several Labour members in the back rows clashed with Conservative members who had crowded into the Labour seats.</p>
<p>The main points of the Foreign Secretary's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>The government believes that the guarantee of mutual assistance given to several countries in the Mediterranean in the event of an attack cannot coexist with the continuation of sanctions.</p>
<p>Britain is determined to maintain an even stronger defensive position in the Mediterranean than before the start of the Italian-Ethiopian War.</p>
<p>The government has decided that the League of Nations should continue to exist, but should be reorganized to give it the best chance of success in dealing with matters in the future.</p>
<p>The Labour opposition's Greenwood and the Liberal opposition's George strongly criticized the government's decision to remove sanctions against Italy. Greenwood also moved to reduce the budget of the Foreign Office to the cheers of the opposition. Greenwood said that the Foreign Secretary's speech was regrettable and amounted to a transaction with dictators. Millions of people who heard it felt ashamed and shocked. The government's foreign policy in the past five years has been extremely harmful, and the current attitude is indeed despicable and can be called the greatest political betrayal in British history. The government's sudden and surprising change is due to Sir Hoare's return to the cabinet. (Note: Hoare is the current First Lord of the Admiralty, who previously resigned as Foreign Secretary because the proposed solution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute negotiated with former French Foreign Minister Laval was opposed by the British people.) Hoare's return to the cabinet is an insult to the millions of people who opposed the "Hoare-Laval Pact." Chamberlain's recent speech indicated the government's policy, including restricting the power of the League of Nations and restoring regional agreements, which is also unpopular. The government should resign quickly to allow the virtuous to try their policy platforms.</p>
<p>George rose to speak after Greenwood, saying that if the government now goes to Geneva to admit that it has been defeated, that the League of Nations has failed and can no longer do anything, it would be tantamount to the end of the League of Nations' authority. The League of Nations was not broken up by its adversaries, but Eden went to Geneva to break it up and destroy the League of Nations. He hoped that Eden would resign to make way for the wise. The opposition cheered at this.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary replied to George's question, saying that the new French government had told him that France did not want to propose the removal of sanctions, and the French government had never given him any indication that France would maintain the current sanctions or would support the implementation of other sanctions.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin then rose to speak, and the government party cheered thunderously. The Prime Minister said that when the League of Nations convenes in the autumn, it must seriously consider the entire issue of collective security. The British government believes that collective security has failed. At any time, the strength of the League of Nations must be based on being able to guarantee or resist aggressors with swift authority. The experience of the past few months has conclusively demonstrated that the collective security needed to bring the League of Nations to this point does not yet exist.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then discussed the general situation in Europe, saying that the government regards it as most important that Germany, France, and Britain should work together to manage peace in Europe. It now hopes that Germany and France can consult with each other to seek better security for peace in Europe. The opinions expressed by the Foreign Secretary just now are unanimously supported by the government. The government knows that taking this action will be disliked by a large part of the British people, but for the sake of the overall situation, it should not show weakness.</p>
<p>Attlee then expressed great dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister's speech and announced that the Labour opposition would introduce a motion of impeachment against the government when the House of Commons continues its debate next Tuesday. The impeachment case declares that "The government, due to its lack of a firm and consistent foreign policy, has diminished the prestige of Great Britain, weakened the League of Nations, and endangered peace, and has therefore lost the confidence of the House of Commons."</p>
<h3 id="e16">A Summary of Eden's Speech <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Recognizing the Futility of Continuing Sanctions Against Italy; The Mediterranean Mutual Assistance Guarantee Remains Effective; Future Efforts to Promote Franco-German Understanding</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a passionate speech, announcing the government's decision to support the lifting of sanctions against Italy. He stated that the government was prepared to participate in any collectively decided action and that the continued implementation of sanctions against Italy was futile. However, he assured that the government intended to exert its utmost efforts to restore the full authority of the League of Nations. In a certain part of his speech, the Foreign Secretary mentioned the British government's repeated efforts to foster friendship between France and Germany, and described the overall situation arising from the German government's abandonment of its Locarno obligations on March 7th. He said that in the current circumstances, the British government felt it was appropriate to hope that the German government would soon provide a reply to the British government's inquiries regarding Hitler's peace plan.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary, when commencing the debate on diplomatic affairs, stated that the government welcomed the opportunity to express its attitude towards the many problems facing the League of Nations. The member states of the League of Nations should, before the end of this month, convene to discuss and settle a resolution on these issues. Since the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the British government has fully participated in collective action. Some may say that collective action should be pursued more perfectly (opponents at this time shouted in disapproval), but no one can deny that the British government has fulfilled all its duties. The British government will continue to do so in the future, and will fully and loyally assist in carrying out any actions decided by the League of Nations General Assembly. If the government were to speak cautiously, it could disregard this, but at this difficult time for the League of Nations, to act in this way would not be considered a courageous act by the British people. This is the government's opinion, and one that it deeply believes in. The government should not only adhere to collective resolutions, but also guide them to success. This is the responsibility that the government bears to the other member states of the League of Nations. The Foreign Secretary then cited instances when every dispute was submitted to the League of Nations, and the British government never shied away from danger, taking the lead in advocating for solutions. In these turbulent times, to evade the obligation of leadership would not be the right path. He deeply felt that in terms of setting an example for those who are troubled, this would be welcomed by many.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then turned to the question of what the League of Nations should do in the current environment. He said that the non-realization of sanctions was the very goal of their implementation. This is a fact that everyone must acknowledge. Abyssinia is now under Italian military occupation. As far as he knows, no part of Abyssinia has a government in place. The current plan of economic pressure, even if continued, can definitely not restore Abyssinia's position. Except for military action from outside, there is nothing that can achieve this goal. As far as he knows, other governments are not prepared to take military action, and the British government is certainly the same. To maintain the current sanctions without any clearly defined purpose would only destroy the sanctions framework, and the League of Nations would soon encounter a situation where its authority would decline even further than it does today. Although the League of Nations has failed to find a way to prevent the success of those who violated the covenant, the government does not regret this. He believes that the other member states of the League of Nations also do not regret this, as all countries have done their best. Therefore, there is nothing to apologize for or retreat from. In the British government's opinion, the verdict passed by the League of Nations last autumn on the act of aggression is not a matter of amendment or revocation.</p>
<p>Before continuing to consider the future actions of the League of Nations, the Foreign Secretary made an important declaration regarding mutual assistance among the member states of the Covenant. The Foreign Secretary cited the guarantees exchanged last December by several Mediterranean powers, including the British government, in accordance with Article 16, Section 3, of the League of Nations Covenant. He stated that in the British government's opinion (which will be stated in Geneva to inspire confidence), if the League of Nations General Assembly decides to lift sanctions, this guarantee should not be extinguished along with the sanctions. After the lifting of sanctions, there will inevitably be a period of unrest. During this period, the aforementioned guarantee should remain effective. Based on the experience of the past few months, the government has decided that Britain should permanently maintain a stronger defensive position in the Mediterranean than it had before the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War. The Foreign Secretary finally discussed the future of the League of Nations, stating that member states should urgently give this their earnest consideration. He had to declare that the British government was resolved that the League of Nations should continue to exist. The fact that the League of Nations had attempted to curb aggression but failed was not a reason to regret this, but rather a reason to reorganize it and give it a better chance of success in the future. To this end, the lessons learned in the past few months must be analyzed. (Reuter's dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e17">British Domestic Public Opinion: Mixed Reactions <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Kowtowing to Aggressor Nations; Weakening the League of Nations Endangers World Peace</p>
<p>(London) The British government's preparations to support the lifting of sanctions against Italy have elicited mixed reactions at home and abroad. The Labour Party in Parliament has issued a declaration to the nation entitled "A Great Betrayal," which states that the League of Nations, which Britain has upheld with honor and deep conviction, is now in grave danger. The government's current advocacy for limiting the League of Nations' mission is a damaging policy that will encourage the violation of treaties and new acts of aggression. The declaration concludes with a sincere appeal to men and women of goodwill, churches, and other organizations to unite in advocating for the defense of collective security, peace, and justice by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The Executive Chairman of the Irish Free State, Mr. de Valera, stated in a speech last night that sanctions have failed and must be lifted. The League of Nations can no longer gain the trust of people worldwide. Canadian Prime Minister King announced in the Canadian House of Commons last night that the Canadian government supports the termination of sanctions.</p>
<p>The Times commented on the government's announcement of its decision in the House of Commons debate, stating that public opinion should demand that the government maintain peace through sound leadership and limit the aftereffects of the League of Nations' current setbacks. This resolution places a greater responsibility on cabinet members to implement constructive foreign policy. The Morning Post stated that the government's resolute abandonment of the sanctions policy has restored its role as a model. Britain's lost prestige in the League of Nations' operations can gradually be recovered. The Daily Telegraph stated that Eden first admitted the League of Nations' shameful failure and that the moral he raised was that this bad debt must be written off and Britain must turn to engaging in reconstruction work. Labour MP Greenwood insisted that the lesson of the past eight months is that the League of Nations' power should not be weakened but strengthened, which is a circuitous argument. The Daily News referred to Baldwin and Eden's attitude as "crawling submission" and stated that there seemed to be nothing in all the facts that could explain this. The Daily Leader stated that the former League of Nations official's statement, "We should not shrink back," has now become "We should advise everyone to shrink back." If cabinet members do not realize that their desire to betray the League of Nations and demean Britain's reputation is not shared by the people, then something even worse than surrendering to Mussolini will follow. The Daily Mail stated that the League of Nations will henceforth be extinguished amid resentment and curses. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Paris Satisfied, Berlin Applauds <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to a Reuter's dispatch from Paris, although French political circles have not issued any comments, observers believe that the Socialist government of Léon Blum is secretly pleased that British Foreign Secretary Eden has helped them escape from a dilemma. All circles related to big business and finance are satisfied. (Dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newspapers have given positive reviews to the speech delivered yesterday by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the British House of Commons. They believe that the British government has decided to keep a part of its fleet permanently stationed in the Mediterranean, rather than transferring it back to the country to reinforce the North Sea defenses. This shows that the British government has deeply believed in Germany's peaceful intentions. (Dispatch from Havas on the 19th)</p>

<p>(London) According to a Reuter's dispatch from Geneva, the British government's decision has startled all circles of the League of Nations. Britain's prestige may suffer a major blow. The general public is also concerned that this is a sign of amending the League of Nations Covenant and that Britain's responsibility under Article 16, the sanctions clause, will be reduced. Therefore, public anxiety has been strengthened. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<p>Still Faithfully Adhering to the Principle of Collective Action; Parliament Scheduled to Debate Foreign Policy on Tuesday</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government today followed Britain's lead and accepted the lifting of sanctions against Italy. Instructions on this matter have been sent to French envoys abroad and were approved by the Cabinet meeting this morning. Foreign Minister Delbos declared at the meeting that the government would faithfully adhere to the principle of collective action and would implement all resolutions passed by the League of Nations. The meeting then studied appropriate methods for strengthening the collective security system and resolved to actively promote its implementation. (Reuter's dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos is scheduled to deliver a speech next Tuesday explaining foreign policy. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will also debate foreign policy on that day. (Dispatch from Havas on the 19th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The press and officials here are taking an extremely reserved attitude toward Eden's speech. The repugnance of each service is expressed through careful wording. It is vaguely stated that lifting economic sanctions is naturally a welcome thing, but future progress still requires attention. The government does not want to express any opinions before receiving the full text of Eden's speech. (Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy has revealed a conciliatory attitude toward the League of Nations and the sanctions issue today. Political circles believe that after the sanctions are lifted, Italy will be able to fully cooperate with the League of Nations. However, if the League of Nations attaches a statement when lifting sanctions, stating that they are abandoning them due to insufficient effectiveness, then Italy may increase its tendency to distance itself from the League of Nations. At the same time, it is recognized here that when the League of Nations revokes the disciplinary plan, Italy will also prohibit the counter-sanctions plan. However, it is admitted that Italy's commercial policy should be reconsidered at that time. As for the current self-sufficiency policy, it will be vigorously promoted to reduce foreign imports to a minimum. (Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e22">Another Failure for Baldwin; British Cabinet Shaken <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Observations from the French Press</p>
<p>(Paris) Various newspapers have been commenting on the proceedings of the British House of Commons last night. Miss Tabouis, a famous reporter for L'Oeuvre, declared, "The situation in the British House of Commons last night was indeed a major failure for British Prime Minister Baldwin. The idea that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will succeed as prime minister has become even more certain." The Socialist Party's organ, Le Populaire, stated, "British public opinion has recently undergone some changes. The British government, aware of this, had Foreign Secretary Eden deliver a speech in the hope of providing various safeguards to British public opinion." The Communist Party's organ, L'Humanité, said that Foreign Secretary Eden had not proposed a constructive peace plan, which was disappointing. This responsibility should now be borne by France.

<p>Urges the Elimination of Drug Traffickers and the Relief of Workers' Suffering; Our Representative Vehemently Condemns the Scourge and Supports the French Proposal</p>
<p>The International Labor Conference, currently held in Geneva, has resolved to implement a campaign to curb the use of opium by workers in the Far East. French labor representative Mr. Stonehouse presented a resolution, which was unanimously passed, urging the abolition of all opium monopolies in the Far East. It is claimed that the countries of the East, known as "expanding powers," should see that their expansion efforts are not underestimated, as evidenced by the fact that their people, who enjoy extraterritorial rights in China, can sell opium to Chinese workers. Chinese representative Li Pingheng announced the extent of the suffering caused by opium to Chinese workers, stating that on average, it is enough to reduce workers' productivity by half. Therefore, adopting the resolution proposed by the French representative is a great help to the government's anti-drug campaign. (Reuter's dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the International Labor Conference, Mr. Stonehouse, a French labor representative, submitted a draft resolution aimed at improving the labor conditions of workers who use opium in some countries in the Far East. The resolution states that opium has an extremely adverse impact on workers' health and suggests that special measures be taken in some countries where opium is freely sold to reduce the number of working days for addicted workers and to provide medical treatment for them. The resolution was passed unanimously by the Labor Conference. Stonehouse also made a statement, saying that this issue had been raised as early as 1909, but due to the greed of private enterprises, workers were treated like animals, and no efforts were made to relieve their suffering, so it has not been resolved to this day. Li Pingheng, the representative of the Chinese government, spoke after Stonehouse, saying that after workers use opium, their work capacity is reduced by 50 percent, and there are hundreds of thousands of addicted workers in the Far East.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held its second executive meeting at 10:00 a.m. this morning to discuss the reorganization of diplomatic institutions and the refreshment of general diplomatic policies. The main issues of this resolution meeting were how to establish East Asia policies, monopolize Chinese interests, how to seek to confront Britain commercially, demand the redistribution of world resources, and discuss the compilation of the new budget for the coming year. Therefore, today's meeting was very cautious in its discussions. If it cannot be fully resolved when it continues tomorrow, it will continue to meet in the middle of next week.

<p>Japan Has No Objections</p>
<p>(London) After the naval treaties of England, the United States, and France were signed in March, there was still the issue of restricting submarine warfare, which required the signatory countries of the Washington Naval Treaty, namely England, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, to sign a protocol to regulate it. Regarding this matter, Mr. Craigie, a naval expert from the Foreign Office, held talks with Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Fujii this afternoon, which lasted for 40 minutes. Craigie personally handed Fujii the draft protocol proposed by Britain. It is said that its contents satisfied the demands made by Japan and France. This draft has been telegraphed by Fujii to his home government for instructions. It is now heard that there are no major discrepancies in the opinions of the countries concerned regarding the issue of restricting submarine warfare, and a final solution should be reached soon. (Dispatch from Havas on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of the continuation of the clause on the restriction of the use of submarines in the fourth part of the London Treaty, the contents of the meeting between Fujii, the acting ambassador to Britain, and Craigie, the British Counselor, had not yet been telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the afternoon of the 19th. However, since the continuation of this clause is an issue to which all countries have no objections, Foreign Minister Arita intends to fully review it. After the new ambassador to Britain, Yoshida, takes office, the five related countries of Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy will formally sign in London. According to the fifth part of the London Treaty, there is no need for a separate agreement, but when Nagai, the plenipotentiary for disarmament, returned home, the British government proposed the separate agreement of this clause, and the Japanese government has also agreed. However, the Japanese government hopes that the form of the agreement must be simple, so the result will definitely follow the British proposal and be signed in the form of a draft record, without consulting the Privy Council.

<p>Lightweight, Durable, and Without the Danger of Rupture; Can Be Used in Airplanes and Tanks</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The automobile manufacturing industry is one of the major sectors of the Japanese military industry today. In view of this fact, Mr. Iwamoto Dousei, the owner of the Iwamoto Industrial Works, recently invented a metallic car wheel. Because automobile wheels and tires are all foreign-made, Iwamoto decided to invent an all-metal car wheel for fear that business would be difficult to continue in the event of an emergency, and he succeeded.

<p>Ten Years of Training Required to Resist Powerful Enemies; MacArthur Appointed Philippine Army General</p>
<p>(Manila) General MacArthur, the head of the US Philippine Military Inspection Group, reported on the inspection of the Philippine military over the past six months, indirectly discussing Japan's Asian strategy. This report was submitted to Congress today by President Quezon of the Autonomous Government. It stated that if the Philippines is oppressed by a strong neighbor, the United States will be in great difficulty and may be involved in the vortex of war. The Philippine reserve soldiers still need ten years of training to resist powerful foreign enemies. Moreover, the Philippines is isolated at sea, and to prevent the invasion by enemy countries, a huge sum of money must be spent on constructing bases to accommodate 300,000 people on Luzon Island. When submitting the report, Quezon appointed MacArthur as a general and requested Congressional approval as compensation for MacArthur's training of the autonomous government's national defense forces. According to the military inspection bill passed by the US Congress, MacArthur can hold military positions in the Philippines concurrently. Quezon declared today that when submitting this report, I sincerely wish to express to the US government and its people the gratitude of the Filipinos for their dispatch of talented people to consolidate the position of the Philippines.

<p>Clear Weather Enables Capture of Valuable Material; Hokkaido Japanese Academic Group Declares Success</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A group of Japanese scientists observing the total solar eclipse in Huma, Amur River, Northern Manchuria, has reportedly achieved complete success. Huma is a remote mining area approximately one hundred miles northwest of Heihe. The group consisted of a joint team from the Shanghai Society of Natural Sciences and the Xijing Observatory. The weather was clear during the eclipse, allowing for the capture of images of the solar corona and the observation of changes in Earth's magnetism. A British scientific team observing in Hokkaido had no success due to heavy clouds during the eclipse. A Tokyo University team observing in Koshimizu also failed to achieve their desired results due to cloud cover. However, within the three-hundred-mile zone of totality across Japan, conditions were excellent with no cloud cover elsewhere. The Tokyo Astronomical Group and a Japanese Central Meteorological Group reportedly obtained extremely satisfactory results. Aircraft also acquired valuable material. (Nineteenth Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The day of the black sun has arrived. Scientists worldwide have mobilized to observe the mysteries of the universe in this short two-minute period. The solar eclipse was first observed in the Mediterranean and traveled eastward at a speed of one kilo per second, passing over Greece, Turkey, the Black Sea, and central Siberia. It entered Japan over the Russian border, making landfall in Wakkanai, the northernmost tip of Hokkaido, at 3:17 PM. Its black shadow passed over Nakatombetsu, Esashi, Omu, Mombetsu, Memambetsu, and Kamishari before finally entering the Pacific Ocean from Nemuro and disappearing at the southern tip of the South Seas. Observation teams from China, Britain, America, India, Australia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland have selected Hokkaido as the most suitable location for observing the solar eclipse and are preparing for observations in the area. (Nineteenth Allied)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reports from the Abashiri Observatory in Hokkaido, the weather in Hokkaido on the 19th was clear. According to the observatory's observations, a low-pressure system was present in the Heilongjiang area on the morning of the 19th, moving towards the northern Kuril Islands in the Pacific. West winds blew in the afternoon, and the weather was clear. (Seventeenth Allied)</p>
<p>Sapporo The solar eclipse, long awaited by scientists worldwide, was best observed from the ground at Nakatombetsu, Esashi, Omu, Mombetsu, Memambetsu, Kamishari, and other locations in Hokkaido. Astronomers from Japan, Britain, America, China, India, Australia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland gathered in these areas, hoping to gain insights from the two minutes spent peering through telescopes. The instant of transition from blackness to light determined the success or failure of this international observation effort. At Memambetsu and Abashiri, the Japanese team led by Dr. Saotome achieved great success due to the clear skies. However, the foreign team based in Kamishari failed because of sudden cloud cover. Japan therefore achieved a triumph. Dr. Stratton and Dr. Allen embraced and appeared quite frustrated. The observation results from other locations are as follows: Esashi - clear, great success; Nakatombetsu - the observation team and the crowd shouted "Banzai!" in celebration of their success; Wakkanai - great success; Mombetsu - great success; Memambetsu - clear, great success; Kamishari - failure due to cloud cover; Koshimizu - partially obscured by thin clouds, hindering observations.

<p>Central News Agency: The solar eclipse, which was visible as a partial eclipse in Shanghai from 1:04 PM to 3:20 PM yesterday, was obscured by gray clouds from morning until night, making it impossible to observe. However, the ambient light during that time seemed dimmer than usual on cloudy days.</p>
<p>New News Agency says: According to the Central Astronomical Research Institute's measurements, the times for the partial eclipse seen in the city yesterday were as follows: first contact at 12:57 PM, maximum eclipse at 2:11 PM, and end of eclipse at 5:17 PM, extremely accurate. However, the weather yesterday was unfavorable, with heavy clouds and dim lighting. The sun briefly appeared around 10:30 AM but then disappeared. The haze was very thick at noon, and the general public, hoping to witness the miracle of the solar eclipse, was disappointed. Therefore, during the initial contact, it was impossible to discern the position of the sun in the dense clouds. Fortunately, the clouds gradually dispersed at 2:35 PM, and the sun was faintly visible through the moving clouds. At that time, people wearing colored glasses and looking upwards could see that the northwestern part of the sun was missing a corner, accounting for slightly less than one-third of the total area. As time progressed, the missing part gradually decreased. Just as the full restoration was expected at 3:05 PM, a cloud suddenly obscured it, and it was no longer visible. When the clouds dispersed at 3:37 PM, the fully restored sun radiated its light once more, illuminating the earth.</p>

<p>Maintaining Domestic Social Order as Reason - Leaders of the Croix-de-Feu to Discuss Response</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today that following the recent clashes in Marseille, the cabinet issued an emergency decree dissolving all extreme right-wing groups, including the Croix-de-Feu. The Parti Français, the French Unity Party, and the Jeunesse Patriotes have all been banned by the government. Originally, this order was only intended to target the paramilitary organizations of various fascist parties, but Interior Minister Sarraut explained today that its scope has been expanded to include all fascist groups, based on the law passed on January 6th, which requires the dissolution of all groups organized for combat or private armies. The Croix-de-Feu is said to have 700,000 members, with 50,000 new members being trained each month. Their leader, Dr. de la Rocque, has stated that he has convened a meeting of leaders and members to discuss future strategies and that "we are prepared for difficulties." (Eighteenth National)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet decided this morning to dissolve all kinds of paramilitary groups, issuing a general order to authorities in all provinces to take all necessary measures to implement the government's order. (A total of four paramilitary groups were explicitly dissolved today: the Croix-de-Feu led by Colonel de la Rocque, the Jeunesse Patriotes led by right-wing figure Taittinger, the French Solidarity led by the late perfume magnate Coty, and the French Fascist Party led by right-wing figure Pougard). Sarraut also issued a statement to the press explaining the reasons for dissolving these groups, stating that "the government must urgently address various serious problems, and therefore, social order must be maintained to the best of our ability, so that both legislative and executive branches can cooperate wholeheartedly. Creating laws to revitalize the national economy and improve the welfare of workers requires domestic stability." (Eighteenth Havas)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Gorky was born in 1868 in Nizhny Novgorod to a furniture maker. He lost his parents at a young age and worked as a servant in his teens, then as an apprentice in a handicraft shop, and later as a baker's assistant. In 1886, Gorky sought education in Kazan but was hindered by poverty. He associated with revolutionaries in Kazan and was arrested for the first time in 1889 for revolutionary activities. In 1891, he walked across Russia to Tiflis, working in a railway factory for a year, where he interacted with workers. In 1891, Gorky's first three works were published in a Tiflis newspaper, and his literary reputation grew. Several Russian newspapers and magazines published his novels. Due to his participation in the revolutionary movement, Gorky was imprisoned several times. By the end of 1899, Gorky was increasingly admired. He first went to St. Petersburg. In 1902, Gorky was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences, but the Tsarist government revoked his qualifications. In 1903, Gorky returned from exile and assisted the Bolshevik Party's financial organization. He was arrested and exiled again in 1905, residing in Capri, where he continued his new work. During this time, Gorky became friends with Lenin, corresponded with him regularly, and actively participated in the Bolshevik Party's work. In 1913, Gorky returned to Russia and continued his literary work. After 1918, he actively participated in the cultural construction of the Soviet Republic. In 1921, Gorky contracted tuberculosis, and Lenin asked him to go abroad for rest and recuperation, returning to the country only in 1928. During this period, in addition to creating new art, Gorky often published works in foreign newspapers, opposing the destruction of the Soviet Union by White Russians abroad. Upon his return to the Soviet Union in 1928, he became a great proletarian writer, and with his immense talent, he participated in socialist creative work. His literary and social activities were highly regarded, not only for his extensive dramatic work but also for his dedication to the working class and his brilliant writings devoted to the victory of communism, which earned him such admiration. In 1929, he was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. In the following years, Gorky continued to dedicate himself to social and political work. He published numerous works, edited and founded several important magazines, and as chairman of the Soviet Writers' Union, greatly contributed to the development of Soviet literature and young writers. Gorky was a most great artist, practitioner, and enthusiastic revolutionary, who throughout his life, devoted his immense talent and expressed the highest voice of humanity, becoming the most perfect exemplar in the world.

<p>(London) The signatory nations of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to hold a conference on June 22 in Montreux, Switzerland, to discuss the re-militarization of the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits. The countries involved are currently engaged in preliminary diplomatic negotiations. It is reported that these nations are generally agreeable to Turkey's demands (i.e., re-militarizing the straits), but one crucial issue remains to be resolved: the maximum tonnage of warships permitted to pass through the straits. Regarding this, Britain believes that since Turkey will be able to establish defensive installations in the straits, it can closely monitor the passage of any warship, negating the need for a tonnage limit. Furthermore, once sanctions against Italy are lifted, Italy may attend the Montreux conference, making the formation of a Mediterranean pact possible. Therefore, the ongoing preliminary negotiations among the countries involved have also touched on the issue of the Mediterranean pact. (Eighteenth Havas)</p>

<p>Rent Disputes</p>
<p>No Need to Enact a Mediation Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened its 63rd meeting on the morning of the 19th, attended by 63 members including Lin Bin, etc. President Sun Ke and Secretary-General Liang Hancao were excused due to illness, with Secretary Chen Haicheng substituting. The matters discussed were as follows:</p>
<p>Further amendments to the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Finance were resolved and passed, adding a provision to Article 23 of the law stating that the Ministry of Finance may, when necessary, employ three to seven specialist members.  Further amendments to the Organizational Law of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance were resolved and passed. Article 12 of the law, which originally stipulated that the Chief Accountant of the Customs Administration was under the direction of the Director-General of the Customs Administration, was amended to be under the supervision and direction of both the Director-General of the Customs Administration and the Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Finance. Article 14 was amended to state that external official documents of the Customs Administration shall be issued in the name of the Ministry of Finance, but with regard to the following matters, orders may be issued by the Administration: 1. Matters that should be relayed and instructed in accordance with the Ministry's orders; 2. Matters that are supervised and carried out in accordance with the methods stipulated in the Ministry's orders; 3. Matters that have been submitted to the Ministry for approval.  Further amendments to the Organizational Law of the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance were resolved and passed, amending Articles 18 and 19 of the law according to the examples of Articles 12 and 14 of the Organizational Law of the Customs Administration in the second case. , Amendments to the Organizational Law of the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance were resolved and passed, amending Article 23 of the law according to the example of Article 14 of the Organizational Law of the Customs Administration in the second case. Article 24, which originally stipulated the establishment of a Chief Accountant, was amended to a Chief Accountant, subject to the supervision and direction of the Salt Administration and the Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Finance.  The Legislative and Land Law Committees reported on the examination of the Draft Mediation Law for Rent Disputes, and it was resolved to pass it according to the examination report. There is currently no need to enact this law. The reasons are as follows: The reason for designating this case was to stipulate the standards for housing rents and rent increases and decreases, so that landlords and tenants have something to follow, and to establish a mediation committee to seek mediation of rent disputes, and to separately stipulate penalties to ensure the effectiveness of mediation. After review by the Yuan, the following conclusions were reached: Regarding the standard of housing rents, the standard of housing rents varies from place to place, and it is difficult to uniformly regulate it. The case was drafted by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Ministry of Industry. At the time of drafting, the Land Law had not yet been implemented. Now that the Land Law has been implemented since March 1 of this year, if there is a situation as stipulated in Article 162 of the Land Law, the provincial and municipal governments can base the standard rent for houses on the provisions of the Land Law. The rent standard set in the case, the maximum limit, shall not exceed 12% of the annual interest of the combined land price and construction cost, which is difficult to implement according to the current situation in various places. This is one reason. Regarding the standards for rent reduction and rent increase, Article 442 of the Civil Law already has provisions for the increase or decrease of real estate rents. If there is a dispute, it can be directly resolved by the court. This is the second reason. Regarding the mediation agency and procedures for rent disputes, Articles 402 and 409 of the Civil Procedure Law both have clear provisions. The organizational laws of cities and counties also have their own regulations regarding civil mediation, which are sufficient to be followed, and the organization of the mediation committee stipulated in the case may not be able to resolve disputes, or even be counterproductive. This is the third reason. Regarding the provisions of fines, the case imposes penalties on those who fail to fulfill the mediation agreement or who file a lawsuit without mediation, which is inappropriate. This is the fourth reason. The above are the main points of the case. According to the results of the review, if all are deleted and revised, there seems to be no need to enact a separate law at present.  The Finance and Legislative Affairs Committees reported on the review of the Draft Regulations on Savings for Civil Servants. It was resolved that the review report of the two committees should be passed, and the case should be temporarily deferred until the amendment of the Central Bank Law is passed, and the articles of association of the Central Trust Bureau are reviewed and passed together before reconsideration.  The Finance Committee reported on the drafting of the Implementing Regulations for the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law. It was resolved to return it to the committee for review and seek the opinion of the Ministry of Finance. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, regarding the further amendment of the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Finance, previously submitted the original text of the proposal to the Executive Yuan, stating that the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Finance passed by the Legislative Yuan has inevitable difficulties in implementation based on the facts, and it is proposed to make appropriate amendments to facilitate implementation. The articles that should be amended are listed as follows: Article 14 of the Organizational Law of the Customs Administration, Article 19 of the Organizational Law of the Taxation Administration, and Article 23 of the Organizational Law of the Salt Administration all list certain matters to be carried out in the name of the Ministry of Finance. In addition to the listed items, they can be carried out in the name of the Administration or the Bureau. The Ministry of Finance is in charge of all financial administration, and all external affairs should be approved by the Ministry. If the above articles are followed, listing the Ministry's orders in the articles is actually equivalent to restricting the Ministry's orders, while the issuance of Administration or Bureau orders has no scope, which is difficult to integrate and supervise. It is proposed to change it to state that all external official documents should be issued in the name of the Ministry of Finance, but with regard to the following matters, orders may be issued by the Administration:  Matters that should be relayed and instructed in accordance with the Ministry's orders,  Matters that are supervised and carried out in accordance with the methods stipulated in the Ministry's orders,  Matters that have been submitted to the Ministry for approval. 2. Article 24 of the Organizational Law of the Salt Administration, the Salt Administration shall establish one Chief Accountant, who is under the direction of the Director of the Salt Administration. According to the Accounting Law and the Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Annual Budget Accounting Statistics of Various Agencies by the Accounting Department of the National Government, the accounting of each Administration and Bureau should be subject to the supervision and direction of the personnel in charge of annual budget accounting statistics of the higher-level agency. The Salt Administration is subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, and its rank is equal to the accounting personnel of other directly subordinate agencies of the Ministry of Finance. It is proposed to change the establishment of a Chief Accountant to a Chief Accountant, who should be subject to the supervision and direction of the Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Finance. As for Article 12 of the Organizational Law of the Customs Administration and Article 18 of the Organizational Law of the Taxation Administration, the phrase "the Chief Accountant is under the direction of the Director" should also be amended to "subject to the supervision and direction of the Director and the Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Finance." 3. Article 27 of the current Organizational Law of the Ministry, which stipulates that the Ministry of Finance may employ consultants and specialist members as necessary for business, should be deleted. Financial matters are complex and varied, and it is necessary to employ specialized personnel to assist in research. It should still be supplemented. The above articles should be forwarded to the Central Political Council and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for amendment. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative and Financial Affairs Committees of the Legislative Yuan were previously ordered to review the draft provisions on the exercise of authority over the budget accounting section in the organizational laws of various agencies. After review, it is proposed to expressly stipulate the number of personnel and the exercise of authority for this item in the organizational laws of various central agencies. As for the number of personnel, it was originally proposed to determine it by referring to the proportion of personnel in each agency. However, according to the results of the investigation, the actual number of personnel currently used by various agencies has exceeded the number stipulated in the current law. If the number of budget accounting personnel is stipulated according to the current law, it may hinder the facts. If the current number of personnel is used as the standard, then the current number of personnel has no legal basis. It was specially submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 19th for instructions. President Sun instructed the two committees to first draft a method and submit it for approval. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e88">Japan Expands Tianjin General Consulate <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Establishing Consular Sub-Branches in Strategically Important Locations; Increasing Police Stations Along the Ping-Han and Jin-Pu Lines to Protect the Special Trade of Japanese and Korean Nationals</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' expansion of the Tianjin General Consulate, the plan for which was previously discussed by the Director of the East Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kuwashima, who came to Tianjin for consultations, has been decided. After Kuwashima returned home, he passed through Shanghai and met with the newly appointed Ambassador Kawagoe, exchanged opinions, and then returned home to report. The Tianjin Japanese General Consulate has now begun preparations to expand the consulate. The reason is to protect the safety of overseas Chinese along the Jin-Pu and Ping-Han lines, the special trade of Japanese and Korean nationals, and the right to reside in various inland areas. It is said that since this spring, the number of Japanese and Korean overseas Chinese has increased, and they are scattered throughout the Ping-Han and Jin-Pu lines. There is no residential safety, and conflicts occur with local officials from time to time. In the future, in order to avoid disputes, the Japanese consulate should directly handle the matter, establish consular sub-branches in key locations, and police stations. The Tianjin Japanese Police Department will increase its patrol officers by more than 80 and dispatch them to various locations for service. Regarding the location of establishment, General Consul Tajiri dispatched Police Inspector Fujii, the head of the Security Section of the Police Department, and Officer Uetsuma to Cangxian, Jinghai, Botouzhen, and Dongguang on the Jin-Pu Line on the 15th of this month to investigate. The scheduled itinerary is eight days, and they will return to Tianjin on the 23rd to report. After the report, they will go to Changxindian, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Xingtai, and other places on the Ping-Han Line to investigate. The proposed sites for consular sub-branches are Cangxian, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang. Police stations will be set up in other locations. In addition, for matters that are not within the jurisdiction of the Tianjin General Consulate but have close connections, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to establish a Taiyuan consulate, sending one consul and one vice-consul, and four or five staff members to handle all affairs of overseas Chinese. It will be realized at the same time as the consular sub-branches along the Ping-Han and Jin-Pu lines.</p>
<p>The four ministries of Japan, including the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, have reached many resolutions on the development of cotton production and the collection of wool textiles in North China. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs is the center for researching programs and adopting the method of division of labor and cooperation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for negotiating with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance is responsible for negotiating tariff agreements, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is responsible for industrial design. In order to realize the plan as soon as possible, the four ministries specially organized a North China Affairs Investigation Team, led by the Section Chief of the Cultivation Department of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, comprising more than 30 people. They departed from Tokyo on June 3, arrived in Northeast China first, and arrived in Tianjin early on the 12th. Immediately, the Tianjin Japanese General Consulate sent staff to introduce them to relevant parties for investigation. The cotton and sheep investigation team, led by team leader Funabashi, with a total of nine members, went to Ping on the 15th and transferred to Inner Mongolia and Chahar to conduct inspections. The cotton production investigation team worked in Tianjin for a week, went to Ping on the 22nd, and transferred to Baoding on the 25th, and went to Dingxian, Zhengding, and Shunde to investigate separately. On the 30th, they will go to Zhengzhou and Chuzhou in Henan, then transfer to Haizhou, go to Qingdao on July 5, go to Jinan on the 11th, go to Shanghai on the 14th, and return home on the 17th. After the four ministries wait for the team to return home and report, they will formulate a plan and promote it through diplomatic means, and realize it within this year. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Zhang Zizhong Takes Office as Mayor of Tianjin <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Qin Dechun Represents Song Zheyuan in Three Points</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The change of mayor in Tianjin, which had been brewing for a couple of weeks, was only decided a few days ago. The authorities were afraid of complications in diplomacy, so they temporarily concealed the truth and promoted a confusing propaganda. It was not until the 16th that the stalemate was broken, and the Hebei-Chahar Political Council ordered Xiao Zhenying to resign, transferred Zhang Zizhong to the post of Chairman of Chahar Province, and sent Liu Ruming, the commander of the 41st Division of the 29th Army, to succeed him. The personnel handover procedures have been completed for the first stage. In terms of political and governmental procedures, on the one hand, Zhang and Liu were instructed to take over the matter first, and on the other hand, they were telegraphed to the Executive Yuan to request the Central Standing Committee to recognize and formally issue an order, but they were still unwilling to make it public to the outside world. On the morning of the 17th, the authorities ordered Zhang Zizhong to rush to Tianjin to take office that day. Because his 38th Division was transferred from Zhangjiakou to Ping, the military transport was not completed, so he took care of it in Ping, and it was not until 1:30 pm that he took a special train from Beining, accompanied by Ma Yanchong, the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government, and Zhang Kexia, the Chief of Staff of the 38th Division, to Tianjin. Song Zheyuan also arrived in Tianjin at 5 pm that day. It was originally scheduled to take over at 5 pm that day, but because it was too late to rush, the ceremony was held at 10 am on the 18th. That night, Song summoned Zhang and the heads of various bureaus in the city at his private residence, and made some clarifications on the personnel changes, and gave some instructions on diplomacy and politics, summarizing the opinions of the public. At 10 am on the 18th, leading figures from all walks of life came to the Municipal Government to attend the ceremony. The dignitaries who attended included Wang Yitang, Li Tingyu, Gao Lingwei, Lin Shize, Chen Juesheng, Liu Jialuan, and the heads of the Municipal Public Security, Social Affairs, Public Works, Finance, and Health Bureaus, Sun Weidong, Liu Donggan, Liu Yushu, Chang Hongjun, and Li Zaizhong, and four or five hundred representatives from all walks of life. After the ceremony was performed, Qin Dechun represented Song Zheyuan in his instructions, which roughly stated that Tianjin is an important commercial port in North China, with a vast area and a dense population, where Chinese and foreigners live together. There are many things that should be done to revitalize and reform. Mayor Zhang has been in the military for many years and has made outstanding achievements. In recent years, he has governed Chahar and has been praised for his political voice. Today, he comes to lead Tianjin, and he should be able to use his past achievements to set an example for politics, and he will surely have good harvests in the future. I only offer three points of hope: 1. The country is based on the people, and officials are set up for the people. The foundation of politics should be the welfare of the people. As the ancients said, like what the people like, and hate what the people hate. I hope that Mayor Zhang will act on the public opinion of all citizens and seek the interests of the citizens. 2. The soundness of the country requires good politics, and the good of politics requires integrity first. I hope that Mayor Zhang will continue his past spirit of integrity, supervise his subordinates, and move forward. 3. Tianjin is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and diplomacy is important. I hope that Mayor Zhang will adhere to the central government's principle of good neighborliness, the principle of mutual benefit, and strive for friendship and peace. In times of peace, treat each other with courtesy, and in times of trouble, argue with reason. I think the gentry of Tianjin will be able to love and help, and the future is bright, which can also be predicted.</p>
<p>Then Zhang Zizhong gave a speech, which roughly stated that today Zizhong takes office as the mayor of Tianjin, and it is a great honor to have guests from all walks of life attending the ceremony. Tianjin is an important commercial port in North China. Since Mayor Xiao resigned due to illness, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has been extremely concerned about local security. The position of mayor cannot be without someone responsible for it for a day. He specially ordered Zizhong to act as an agent temporarily. I know that I am not capable enough to shoulder the heavy responsibility, but as a soldier, I only know how to obey orders. In the future, in terms of politics, I will eliminate all bad habits and establish a style of integrity under the principle of benefiting the country and the people, not telling lies, and not harboring selfish intentions, and strive to achieve a state of political clarity. Regarding local security, I will do my best to maintain it. In addition, such as relieving the people's livelihood, prospering the market, and rectifying the city appearance, I will also do my best to work hard to seek welfare for the people. Regarding diplomatic matters, Tianjin is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together. Zizhong is determined to stand on the position of his own duties, uphold the intention of good neighborliness, and hope to make efforts for coexistence and co-prosperity in the spirit of mutual benefit and equality. The standard of employing people is that anyone who is loyal to his duties will never be changed. If he is not competent or does not fulfill his duties, he will naturally be unable to help, so that people can make the most of their talents. However, Zizhong has been in the army for a long time and is not familiar with politics. I still hope that people from all walks of life will give me advice at any time and correct my shortcomings. The ceremony ended at about 11 o'clock, and photos were taken in the courtyard and dispersed. Shi Jisheng, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, handled the handover on behalf of Xiao, and resigned and went to Ping in the afternoon of the same day. The vacancy was filled by Ma Yanchong, the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government who came with Zhang, and took office on the same day.</p>
<p>Zhang Zizhong, courtesy name Jinchen, is 46 years old, from Linqing County, Shandong Province. He graduated from a law and politics school. In the third year of the Republic of China, he joined the army. In the fifth year, he served as a platoon leader of the 16th Mixed Brigade of the Army. In the 68th year, he was promoted to the model company commander of the brigade. In the eighth year, he was promoted to camp adjutant. In the tenth year, he was promoted to battalion commander. In the thirteenth year, he was promoted to the head of the Student Corps of the Northwest National Army. In the fifteenth year, he served as the brigade commander of the 15th Brigade of the Army. In the sixteenth year, he was promoted to the principal of the Second Group Army Military Academy, and concurrently served as the commander of the 28th Division. In August of the seventeenth year, it was changed to the commander of the 25th Division of the Central Land Vehicle. In the eighteenth year, it was changed to the 6th Division of the National Army, and he still served as the commander. In January of the twentieth year, it was changed to the 38th Division of the 29th Army, and he still served as the commander. In October of the twenty-fourth year, he served as a member of the Chahar Government and Chairman of the Province. He is now transferred to the Mayor of Tianjin. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Second Theft in the Forbidden City; Large Number of Antiques Lost from Qianqing Palace <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Internal Personnel Suspected; One Person Has Been Apprehended and is Under Interrogation; Beiping Correspondence: After the theft in the Palace Museum and the southward transportation of antiques, there are not many left in Beiping. However, there are still quite a few valuable ones. After verification in the 23rd year, they were sealed up separately. However, there have been rumors of theft in recent years. Inside the iron fence behind the throne in the Qianqing Palace is where the verified antiques are stored. On the 18th, Palace Museum staff went to collect antiques and discovered that the fence lock had been broken and the stored antiques were in disarray. The report was given to Yu Heyin, the head of the preservation section of the museum, and then to Zhang Tingji, the head of the general affairs office. The report was given to President Ma Heng, and team leader Dong Yinfu and others were sent to reinvestigate. It was discovered that the antiques in that place were the antiques that had been verified by the verification committee in the 23rd year. After clearing the register, Zhao Ziang's calligraphy of Ma's true work was lost, and he tried his best to take it away, leaving the shaft behind. In addition, twelve white jade Ruyis, two vegetable Ruyis, one coral Ruyi, celebrity calligraphy and paintings and forty-three imperial folding fans, seventeen enamel watches of various types, and one ancient bronze incense burner were also lost. The rest are still under reinvestigation. At 2:00 pm, Qian Zongchao, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Liangchen, the head of the detective squad, and Qing Yin, the head of the Sixth District Office, jointly investigated the truth with the staff of the Palace Museum. Ma Heng also sent Bai Guiliang, the captain of the guard team of the museum, to investigate, and believed that it was done by internal personnel. As a result, a suspect has been detected, and he was still being interrogated on the night of the 18th. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Japanese Ronin Increasingly Smuggling at Jinan Station <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Assaulting and Humiliating Road Police and Anti-Smuggling Personnel</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly rampant, and there is still no effective way to stop it. In recent days, the number of smuggled goods transported from Tianjin to Jinan has been increasing. There is almost no passenger space on third-class carriages. The goods are mainly rayon, sugar, and cigarette paper, followed by Biji formal dress woolen cloths. All of them are handled by Korean ronin. These goods are loaded on the 305 train from Pingpu to Jinan, which arrives at 9:40 am every day. Not only do they not pay customs duties, but they also do not have railway transport permits. It is said that when loading the train in Pingjin, they are thrown from outside the window to the inside, regardless of whether there are passengers. Therefore, passengers in the car are often injured. After arriving in Jinan, they are still thrown out of the window, destroying all the car window glass. After unloading, they force porters to carry them outside the station and load them onto cars or handcarts that they have prepared. Although our country's anti-smuggling inspection office has been established and has detained smuggled goods several times, they have been forcibly taken away and police and anti-smuggling personnel have been repeatedly assaulted and humiliated. In recent days, the amount of smuggled goods has been even greater, and ronin are rampant on the train. This morning (17th), a martial drama occurred. Staff of the anti-smuggling office, road police from the police section, and two passengers were all assaulted and humiliated, which is outrageous. The course of events is recorded as follows: Today (17th), the 305 train from Pingpu to Jinan, which arrived at 9:47 am, was full of smuggled goods packed in sacks and straw bags on third-class carriages, including rayon, white sugar, and cloth, totaling 358 pieces. After the train arrived at the station, as usual, 60 to 70 ronin who escorted and picked up the train threw the goods out of the window onto the platform, and then handed them over to the porters to carry them outside the station. Today, while the unloading was taking place on the platform, two passengers, each carrying a small camera, were filming the smuggled goods. Their intention was only driven by curiosity. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by the smugglers, who rushed forward and smashed the cameras, and beat the photographers. At this time, the chief of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Police Section was at the station, and went forward to persuade them in order to maintain order. However, the ronin were unreasonable and behaved like mad dogs, and assaulted the road police, patrol chiefs, and patrol officers. The ronin were all carrying canes and shouting loudly. Those who were beaten had their noses broken and blood flowed out. There were other passengers on the station who were also beaten occasionally. In order to avoid causing trouble, the patrol chief of the section recalled the road police to the police section when surrounded. After assaulting people, the ronin were still angry, and some of them were still looking for people to beat inside the station. Even a small number went to the office of the anti-smuggling personnel in the stationmaster's office, dragged three anti-smuggling inspectors out and beat them in groups. Although people surrounded them to protect them, the three had been beaten. Li Tonghua, the deputy director of the anti-smuggling office, and Ye Yuchun, the director of Jinan, were spared from the disaster because they were wearing Western clothes and not anti-smuggling uniforms. When the conflict occurred, passengers, except for those who escaped from the station, those who watched the situation could not help but shed tears and lamented the misery of a weak country. After receiving a telegram from the station, the Jinan Japanese Consulate sent personnel to the station. At that time, the siege had been lifted. The ronin claimed to the Japanese Consulate that they had been beaten. Later, our country's police section and anti-smuggling office told them the reason and said that the photography was not very intentional, but the Japanese Consulate still did not believe it. At 11 o'clock, the personnel of the Japanese Consulate returned, and the storm temporarily ended.</p>

In addition to the lawyers and clerks who handled the original cases, there were no fewer than a dozen witnesses, including the parties and interested parties in each case. Until 1:00 pm yesterday (19th), Yu Zhong, the chief of the Criminal Court of the Wu County Local Court, continued to open the debate court. The lawyers Yan Mian, Wu Chao, and Lu Dingkui, who were hired by Tan Yang, all appeared in court. The details are as follows: At 3:15, Yu Zhong, the chief of the Criminal Court, Chen Ziguan, Fang Qinghuan, and clerk Shen Weizong took their seats in the first court. Prosecutor Zhu Shufen also attended the court to perform her duties. After the court was opened, the names and native places of Tan Yang were inquired first, and after announcing the process of repeatedly summoning the witnesses, Yang Shaopeng was questioned first, and asked whether Tan Zhuohong had told you to plead for mercy outside, and Yang replied no. Asked why everyone is attacking you, and Zhang Qidong withdrew the lawsuit himself, and has nothing to do with you, why is he also attacking you? At this point, Tan Zhuohong was questioned, and it was stated that the judge of the Shanghai Local Court took office in May last year. The presiding judge asked whether the five cases of Zhang Qidong, Qin Zhengru, Cheng Li Tianzhi, Lei Yunsheng, and Wu Peizhen were all handled by you. The answer was yes. Regarding these cases, did you entrust Yang Shaopeng to say hello and contact outside? The answer was no. Asked why the witnesses who came to the court attacked you, Zhang Qidong withdrew the lawsuit himself, not the defendant, why did he also attack you? After the questioning, he was ordered to start the debate. Prosecutor Zhu Shufen stood up to argue the reasons and opinions for the prosecution of the case. Lu Dingkui, the lawyer for Yang Shaopeng, defended him once in accordance with the regulations. The court ordered that the debate in the case be concluded, and the sentencing was scheduled for 3:00 pm on the 25th.</p>

She immediately twisted him into the fourth sub-bureau for investigation. After Wang, the chief of the sub-bureau, inquired about it, he immediately</p>

<h3 id="e108">Qujiang Wharf Groundbreaking Ceremony Today <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>President Kong Personally Presides Over the Ceremony The First Phase of Construction to Be Completed by Year-End</p>
<p>The Central Bank's investment in the construction of the Qujiang Wharf has been underway for over a year. The first phase of the project is scheduled for completion by the end of this year, and the various buildings are already taking shape. A groundbreaking ceremony will be held this afternoon, and President Kong arrived from Nanjing last night to personally preside over the ceremony. The order of the ceremony and the wharf construction plan are detailed below:</p>
<p>Central Bank Investment and Construction</p>
<p>To develop international trade, support state-owned enterprises, and promote the prosperity of the Greater Shanghai area, the Central Bank decided to invest in the construction of the Qujiang Wharf and Warehouse in the spring of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1934]. In September of that year, Chen Jì'ān, Ye Zhuótáng, Chá Délì, Liu Hongsheng, Song Ziliang, and others were appointed to organize the Qujiang Wharf Design Committee. In May of the 24th year [1935], Zhang Gongquan and Xu Keting were added as committee members to study all construction plans. By August, the design work was completed, and the Design Committee was reorganized into a Construction Committee, with the same members, and Song Ziliang was appointed as chairman to oversee the project. Construction has been underway for over a year, and various projects are taking shape. It has been decided that a groundbreaking ceremony will be held at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held Today</p>
<p>The groundbreaking ceremony for the wharf is scheduled to take place at 3:00 PM this afternoon, with the following order: 1. All stand at attention; 2. Play music; 3. Pay the highest respects to the Party, National Flag, and the Portrait of the Premier; 4. The Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's Will; 5. Chairman Kong delivers the opening remarks; 6. Song Ziliang, Chairman of the Qujiang Wharf Construction Committee, reports on the project plan and the progress of construction; 7. Minister Wu Dingchang, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and others deliver speeches; 8. Perform the groundbreaking ceremony; 9. Refreshments; 10. Photography; Adjournment. The committee has distributed invitations, inviting people from all walks of life to participate in the ceremony. The route to and from the venue is as follows: from Yangshupu Road, turn into Dinghai Road, cross Dinghai Bridge, follow the west road of the Dinghai Island Dredging Bureau, to the north end of the Fish Market Ferry Terminal. The committee has arranged a special ferry to transport attendees.</p>
<p>Entire Plan Implemented in Three Phases</p>
<p>The Qujiang Wharf is located on the west bank of the Huangpu River, north of the Qujiang Estuary at No. 90 Shangzi. It encompasses over 800 mu of reclaimed land and over 300 mu of land within areas Zhou 1, 3, and 2. After purchasing and filling the land to 19.5 feet above the Wusong Datum, there will be over 3,000 feet of shoreline and over 1,000 feet of docks, all suitable for building wharves and warehouses. The entire plan is divided into three phases. The first phase will involve the construction of two wharves, two reinforced concrete warehouses, and two iron-roofed sheds, with a total construction cost of five million yuan. The location is in the southern section of the wharf area, accounting for one-third of the total area. Construction is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of this year, at which point operations can begin. If necessary, the second and third phases of the project will also be carried out. Upon completion of the entire plan, there will be 3,000 feet of straight-line wharf shoreline, eight four-story steel-framed warehouses, three iron-roofed sheds, and a barge port at the south end. The Puxi Road, a major arterial road in the city, will be located 1,000 feet behind the warehouses, running north and south. The Wuquan Road runs east and west, bisecting the area from the city center to the middle edge of the wharf. At the northern part of the wharf area, there is also a public wharf, 350 feet long. Within the wharf area, along both sides of Puxi Road, there is space reserved for the construction of travel agencies, shipping companies, transportation companies, automobile companies, hotels, and other agencies related to the wharf. As for the water supply equipment for ships, the fire protection of the wharf and warehouses, as well as security and sanitation issues, every effort is made to ensure convenience for passengers and those picking them up, with thorough and complete facilities. Separate routes are provided for passenger travel and cargo transportation, so as not to interfere with each other. There are reception rooms for passengers and those picking them up to rest, which also include shops selling food, beverages, and well-known Chinese products for passengers to purchase. Other facilities, such as observation decks, customs baggage and passport inspection offices, parking lots, police stations, and information centers, are also available. In short, passengers' stay, departure, and arrival are all made as convenient as possible.</p>
<p>Initial Phase to Be Completed by Year-End</p>
<p>The first phase of the project was originally scheduled for completion this autumn, but the arrival of the pilings ordered from the United States was delayed due to the US dockworkers' strike, so it will now be completed by the end of the year. The wharf was originally planned to be a single straight wharf, but a barge port, 220 feet long, is temporarily being built in the middle, causing the shoreline to curve inward, thus forming two wharves, each 590 feet long. The lower part is filled with wood pilings, and the upper part is constructed of reinforced concrete. The pilings are driven below the average waterline to prevent decay. The wharf deck is 50 feet wide and equipped with all berthing facilities. There are mooring pilings 50 feet apart and horizontal timbers for barges to moor. The deck has rotating cranes, and there is a lower deck to allow small boats and barges to operate normally when the tide is low. The above is the first phase of the project. After completion, each wharf can accommodate the largest liners entering and leaving the Huangpu River, and when the entire project is completed, the total length of the wharf will reach over 3,000 feet, allowing six large liners, each 500 feet long, to dock simultaneously.</p>
<p>Four Warehouse Buildings Constructed First</p>
<p>There are four warehouses standing behind the wharf. The two inside are reinforced concrete warehouses, which are permanent structures. The lower part is driven with 100-foot and 90-foot-long pilings, and the upper part is made of reinforced concrete. The foundation is designed for four stories, but the first phase will only construct two stories, with the remaining two stories to be added later when business expands. Each warehouse is 220 feet long and 130 feet wide, with the upper floor used for long-term storage and the lower floor for short-term storage. The two outside are iron-roofed sheds, which are temporary structures used for short-term storage. Each is 220 feet long and 80 feet wide, with three bridges connecting directly to the wharf deck. This is also part of the first phase of the project. When permanent steel-framed warehouses are rebuilt in the future, the iron-roofed sheds can be dismantled and moved to the rear for reuse.</p>
<p>Warehouse Capacity and Loading/Unloading Equipment</p>
<p>The current total volume of the warehouses is 15,000 tons. The wharf deck outside the warehouses is equipped with track-mounted cranes that can lift goods directly from the ship's hold to any floor of the steel-framed warehouses without the need for manual handling. In front of the warehouses, there is a duplex linear crane at the cargo inspection area that can lift goods directly from the lower level of the warehouses to the upper level. All cranes include four cargo transport vehicles, two inclined roller vehicles, and one one-ton and one six-ton mobile lifting vehicle. There are also 150 cargo roller trolleys. If necessary, several two-ton and ten-and-a-half-ton rotating cranes will be added. The rear of the warehouses is equipped with elevators, so the interior of the warehouses can maintain one-way traffic.</p>
<p>Offices and Staff Residences</p>
<p>The offices are located in the middle of the warehouses, along the barge port, and are two stories high, 220 feet long, and built of reinforced concrete and brick tiles. The upper floor is the wharf management office, and the lower floor is allocated as a customs inspection station and passenger reception room in accordance with the new customs regulations. At the southwest end of the wharf area, not far from the wharf warehouses, several staff residences have been built, including one residence for the wharf manager, two residences each for the wharf supervisors and customs inspectors, one staff dormitory that can accommodate 40 people, and six two-story houses with two rooms each, and twelve two-story houses with one room each.</p>
<p>Building Wuquan Road to Connect Various Areas</p>
<p>Within the wharf area, there are over 250,000 square feet of open space, divided into nine rectangular plots, reserved as bases for future warehouse construction. The perimeter is surrounded by roads paved with cinder to provide access to all directions. One of the wider roads leads directly to the northern gate, connecting with the Wuquan Road currently under construction. The road runs east-west, starting from the north end of the wharf, crossing the Jungong Road, and reaching the city center. It is being built jointly with the Shanghai Municipal Government, requiring a construction cost of 1.5 million yuan, and is scheduled to be completed at the same time as the first phase of the wharf construction. There are three traffic routes: 1. From Wuquan Road, turn into Jungong Road to reach Yangshupu Road; 2. From Wuquan Road, pass through the city center and turn into Qimei Road to reach Desway Road; 3. From Wuquan Road, pass through the city center and turn into Jiangwan Road to reach North Sichuan Road. The travel time by car on these three routes is less than 20 minutes, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Discussion on Extending the Songhu Railway Line</p>
<p>In addition to highways, there are plans to extend the Songhu railway line to connect with the wharf. This railway will have one track located behind the warehouses, merging into one at the intersection of Wuquan Road, and connecting to the Songhu line along the Huangpu River north of the city center. The route is nine kilometers long, and according to estimates by the two railway bureaus, the construction cost will require 750,000 yuan and take about three months. The two parties are currently in discussions on joint construction. If construction can begin in the near future, it is hoped that it can be completed at the same time as the wharf. In the future, cargo loading and unloading can be directly handled by cranes, without the need to move goods to warehouses. Furthermore, there are several thousand acres of vacant land near the wharf. The Greater Shanghai plan originally included a plan to open an airport, and a designated area on the river surface for seaplane mooring. If this becomes a reality in the future, the transportation of goods at the wharf will not only have water and land connections, but will also achieve the combined transport effects of water, land, and air. This may be built when the entire plan is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Business Conditions in the First Half of the Year <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Major Banks All Have Profits National Goods Industry Also Shows Some Progress</p>
<p>According to inquiries with relevant parties, the business conditions of various industries in the city in the first half of the year are as follows: Major banks with strong capital reserves all have profits. Other banks are mostly able to maintain operations with difficulty. The exact situation will be clear around the 26th and 27th of this month, as they are currently busy closing accounts. The real estate industry appears to be slightly more active this period compared to the past, but there are still no large-scale transactions. In general, this industry has become a spent force due to the sluggish market. Although there are no accurate statistics on the industrial and commercial situation of the national goods industry last year, it is predicted that if the smuggling problem in North China can be stopped immediately, there will be better development in the second half of the year. Small industries have developed rapidly in recent years, but the profits are very small. This is mainly due to the shortage of capital, the lack of refinement in the output, and the weak sales. However, due to the very low expenses, they are all able to maintain operations without losses.</p>

<p>The Three Banks Have Granted the Request</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously allocated 25 million yuan in financial public bonds to rescue the qianzhuang industry, and established a qianzhuang industry supervision committee. The Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications provided loans of 18 million yuan, while commercial banks and the qianzhuang reserve fund provided a total of 7 million yuan. Now, in addition to the 7 million yuan from commercial banks and the qianzhuang reserve fund, which has already been repaid, the 18 million yuan from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications has been handled by the borrowing qianzhuang to repay the loans. As of yesterday's deadline, 14 million yuan had not yet been repaid. Now the borrowing qianzhuang have decided to wait until after the Summer Festival, when the funds received by industries and businesses will be transferred to the qianzhuang and then repaid. It is heard that the three banks have secured guarantees for these loans and have therefore granted the request.</p>
<h3 id="e111">British Ship Has Suspended Service to Lianyungang <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Cables Nanjing for Intervention The Ganzhou Cargo Ship Officially Discontinued Service to Laoyao Lianyungang, as an inland port of China, foreign ships are not usually allowed to call. The Taikoo Dockyard Company decided to suspend services of seven ships due to unprecedented recession of shipping routes along the coast, so as to reduce the losses of overcapacity. They then deployed the Ganzhou cargo ship to Laoyao for coal transportation and passenger and cargo loading, which sparked strong opposition from private shipping merchants in Shanghai.</p>
<p>They sent a cable to the central government requesting an injunction, fearing that if this precedent were allowed, not only British ships but also ships from other countries would compete. While the joint water-land transportation only allows Chinese-owned ships and private ships are not permitted, now it would be broken by the foreign merchants, such that in the future, all ports in inland China would be open to foreign ships, and how could national ships survive? At the same time, due to the direct conflict of interests, Cai Zengji of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also sent an urgent cable to Nanjing</p>
<p>to Deputy Minister Yu Feipeng, requesting an effective injunction. Now it has been confirmed that Yu has discussed with the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Finance, and they have decided that foreign ships should be banned from sailing to the new inland port of Laoyao in accordance with the decision of the Executive Yuan. The combined cargo of the Longhai Railway will still be carried by Chinese-owned ships according to the original plan. The Longhai Railway Administration is requested to prevent foreign ships from berthing at the dock when they sail to Lianyungang as soon as possible. The local customs office is also notified to ban the customs clearance of foreign ships for export.</p>
<p>The above measures are the most effective way to maintain the right of navigation in inland ports and to prevent foreign forces from seizing the joint transportation of goods from the Northwest. The central government has already implemented this, and the Ganzhou cargo ship of the Taikoo Dockyard Company in Shanghai, which has been sailing to Lianyungang, has made three trips. It has now received this news and has automatically suspended its service, and has completely abandoned this route. At the same time, it has announced the official discontinuation of the Ganzhou cargo ship and will no longer sail it.</p>

<p>Believe That the Grade Inspection Method Is Difficult to Implement Universally Elected Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi Representatives to Attend the Inspection Meeting Telegram to Zhejiang Unified Committee to Quickly Release the Detained Chunman Silk Factory The Shanghai Silk Industry Association held its fourth temporary representative meeting of the second session at the association's location on North Shansi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and also held a joint meeting with the Zhejiang and Wuxi silk industry representatives and associations to discuss the raw silk export grade inspection standards of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and elected representatives to attend the meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>Yesterday, representatives from the following silk factories attended: Xiexing, Jiuyu, Jiyu, Shifu, Qinyi, Yifeng, Hengtai, Xinglun, Yuanyu, Yuanji, Xinchang, Fuchang No. 1, Fuchang No. 2, Tailun, Hengcang, Hongtai, Heji, Changji, Liyuan, Dongxiang, Yufeng, Guangyuan, Tongyu, Dafeng, Shaoxing, Dacheng, Baotai, Gansheng, Yutai, Qiaoyuan, Xingchang, Yihe, etc. Silk factory representatives Shen Huachen, Wang Xiaoxiang, Zhang Peishen, Huang Jiwen, etc., Zhejiang silk industry representatives Jiang Laixian, Zhu Jingan, Wuxi silk industry representatives Qian Fenghao, Wang Huanan, Xu Shouyi, Zheng Haiquan, Cheng Bingruo, Wang Xieming, Cao Shaochen, and others, a total of 50 people, were present. After Chairman Shen Huachen reported on the purpose of the meeting, he read the draft of the raw silk export grade inspection standards set by the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the original letter calling for the meeting, and the instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Social Affairs Bureau regarding the registration of silk factory workers. Then, the discussion began: The draft of the raw silk export grade inspection standards set by the Commodity Inspection Bureau was discussed and resolved that this standard adopts the Japanese silk inspection method used in the Japanese market. In China, due to the differences in silk factory machinery, the types of silk have not been unified, and the skills of workers have not been properly trained, so it cannot be universally implemented. Regarding the Commodity Inspection Bureau's call for a meeting of silk manufacturers at 2:00 PM on June 22nd to discuss the raw silk export grade inspection, it was resolved that Shanghai would send Shen Huachen and Huang Jiwen as representatives, Wuxi would send Qian Fenghao and Cheng Bingruo, and Zhejiang would send Chu Jisen and Zhu Jingan. Regarding the detention of Chunman silk factories by the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee for receiving addresses that are below standard, it was resolved to telegram Zhejiang Province again to quickly release the detained Chunman silk factory. Regarding the order from the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Social Affairs Bureau to conduct the registration of Shanghai silk factory workers, it was resolved to send a letter to the silk industry trade unions in each district to explain the meaning of registration to the workers before proceeding with the registration. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Inspection Procedures</p>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau stipulates the raw silk grade inspection guidelines and procedures: 1. Batching: Each batch should have five pieces of the same raw silk and should not have different numbers. 2. White cloth bags: The white cloth bags for packaging raw silk must be 4.04 city feet long, 3.12 city feet wide, and 3.6 city feet high, and must be prepared by each silk factory.

<p>At the Naval Training Ground on Longhua Road</p>
<p>Since taking office, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, Mr. Cai Jinjun, has spared no effort in reforming the city's police administration. He has been particularly active in training senior police officers. In addition to the police trainees trained by the Police Training School, he has also transferred and concentrated active senior police officers from various branch bureaus and teams for rigorous training. Two training sessions have already been completed with excellent results, and training is still ongoing. Yesterday marked the completion of the third session of the concentrated training team. A general review was held at the naval training ground on Longhua Road in the city. Graduating police trainees from the training school and the police chief class were also ordered to participate in the review. More than a thousand senior police officers attended. Wang Xiong, the chief of the police force, served as the general commander. All branch bureau chiefs and bureau-level directors and above also attended. The mayor was invited to personally review the troops, and the ceremony was quite grand. At 5:00 AM yesterday, training teams from various locations arrived one after another for preliminary drills. By 7:30 AM, all officials and police officers were present. At 8:00 AM, the mayor and Director Cai entered the field, accompanied by General Commander Wang Xiong, Chief Inspector Wang Dasui, Deputy Chief Inspector Tong Guangfu, Director of the Training Section Xu Taikong, and others for a week-long inspection of the troops. This was followed by a marching parade, led by the bureau's military band. Fortunately, the weather yesterday was cloudy and rain-free, with a suitable climate. All police officers were in high spirits, with serious attitudes and orderly paces, displaying great vigor. After the marching parade, Director Cai recited the Party members' code of conduct and the military discipline instructions. The entire assembly stood at attention and listened respectfully. The mayor then gave a speech, stating, "The relationship between the police and self-governance is extremely close. Self-governance requires accurate household registration, which is essential before any undertaking can commence. This task rests on the shoulders of the police. The central government has scheduled the convocation of the National Assembly in November of this year to promulgate the constitution, which will serve as the foundation for constitutional government. Therefore, the police bear the greatest responsibility for local self-governance," and so on. Director Cai then gave a speech, stating, "The main points of the mayor's instructions are that the bureau's past efforts in investigating household registration, promoting literacy education, carrying out the Baojia system, and rigorously conducting training have all been guided by these principles, aiming to achieve the goals of police-public integration and public-police integration," and so on.</p>

<p>Simple and Beautiful Savings Box Design</p>
<p>Starting with School Children</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is introducing new safety deposit boxes with modern equipment at low rates. A large portion has already been rented out. The children's savings business will be handled as soon as approval from the ministry is received. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Adding Safety Deposit Boxes</p>
<p>The bureau's new safety deposit boxes total more than 3,000, in various sizes, with the latest types of safety doors and other features, similar to those of the Four Banks Savings Association. The fee is only one yuan. There is also a type of open deposit storage, with fees calculated based on the volume of the package. It is reported that many people went to rent them on the opening day, and one-fifth have already been rented out. There is also a type of savings gift certificate, and the implementation plan has also been decided. It is reported that it will be implemented starting next month.</p>
<p>Children's Savings</p>
<p>Various regulations and rules have been drafted and submitted to the ministry. They are currently under review by the ministry. Once approval is received, they can be implemented. The bureau has also created a sample savings box, about seven inches tall, similar to an ordinary mailbox, with green paint, making the appearance quite attractive. The cost is about one yuan. When launched, it will be sold to children at a higher price than ordinary savings as an incentive. The launch will first be piloted in important cities such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Ping, and Tianjin, and is planned to start with school children.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Chamber of Commerce Petitions the City Government: Do Not Detain Minor Offenses <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Improve Bureaucratic Bad Habits, Hoping to Avoid Wasting Time</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of petitioning: On the 18th of this month, the Flower and Tree Industry, Southern Goods Industry, Sand and Stone Industry, Steel Bar and Old Iron Industry, Sandalwood and Longan Store Industry, Bamboo Industry, Sandboat Trade, and other trade associations jointly sent a letter stating that citizens in the city each have their own business. If they encounter minor matters that require interrogation by the public security bureau in each district, minor cases that are not important can be resolved if they are interrogated immediately. However, the district bureaus do not care whether the case is minor or major, and often order the parties involved, both plaintiff and defendant, to be detained in the district bureau from morning till night before interrogating them. This situation may be acceptable for major cases, but applying it to minor cases inevitably wastes other people's time and disregards people's livelihoods. At a time when the New Life Movement is being promoted, these bureaucratic bad habits should be improved. Minor offenses should be handled quickly to avoid citizens aimlessly waiting, wasting time, and hindering the freedom of business. For this reason, it is suggested that the Public Security Bureau be instructed to order each district bureau to seek speed in handling cases in the future. In the event of major cases, the plaintiff may be allowed to provide a guarantee to appear when summoned, and the plaintiff should not be detained in the district bureau at the same time. After reviewing the case files, it was found that in criminal cases where the circumstances are not very serious and there is no risk of flight, bail may be legally allowed to avoid detention. As for plaintiffs who are self-represented, there is no system for adding detention. Criminal cases are still ongoing, not to mention the handling of district bureaus, most of which are minor offenses, which should be interrogated immediately. If there are too many cases to interrogate, they can be summoned again the next day, so why detain them first? It is clear that this is an illegal deprivation of people's freedom. This matter, combined with the statements of the trade associations, shows that it is a long-standing habit that is not a matter of a day or two. It is necessary for your government to explain the importance of respecting the rule of law and order them to abolish these bad habits and properly establish legal procedures. If any district bureaus still detain people in minor offense cases in the future, they should be dismissed and investigated at any time to ensure the rule of law and discipline officials. It is therefore reasonable to submit this petition to your government for review and approval for implementation, which would be in the public interest."</p>

Li Dachao gave a speech, followed by Li Dachao, Zhang Yuliang, Lu Lihua, and Yu Binqi as hosts. Li Dachao then gave a speech, stating that the purpose of the swimming performance initiated by the association could be divided into two: First, the city center swimming pool is scheduled to open for one day, to enable citizens to swim in the city center and achieve the goal of prosperity. Second, this grand performance will increase the interest of citizens. It is reported that the fundraising result for the birthday celebration is expected to be good. The venue has a total of 3,500 seats and can accommodate 3,800 people. The ticket prices are five yuan (on the podium), two yuan (east-facing grandstand), and one yuan (southwest-facing grandstand). To meet the requests of all parties to reduce ticket prices to make it more accessible, it was decided to designate a portion of the southwest side (accommodating 500 people) and reduce the ticket price to fifty cents. Tickets will be sold at the ticket office at that time. Several thousand dollars worth of tickets have already been sold. The association hopes that this performance will have a surplus of more than 3,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e130">China International Famine Relief Commission: Dredging of Quan River in Shandong Province Completed <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Quan River is located in the territory of Wenshang County, Shandong Province. Recently, due to the narrow and shallow river channel, it has often suffered from flooding, especially last year. The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at 505 Henan Road in this city, in order to provide relief to the victims, issued 15,500 yuan in national currency and 1,000 bags of flour to carry out work relief and engage in dredging. Since work began on March 24th of this year, a total of 1,550 workers have been hired. Because the mud volume counting system was used, with wages based on the cubic measure of mud dug, the workers were very diligent. The project progressed very quickly and was completed on the 6th of this month. From now on, 160,000 acres of farmland, 170 villages, and 40,000 residents along the river can avoid flooding. It is reported that in addition to a living expense of 11 cents, each worker in this work relief project can earn 15 to 20 cents per day, which can be used to support their families, leaving an average of 10 cents per day.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Shantytown Residents in Zhabei Petitioned the Party and Government Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Due to Forced Eviction Orders from Nearby Police Stations</p>
<p>The Authorities Granted a Stay of Eviction and Will Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>Residents of shantytowns at the intersections of Changan, Yutong, and Tongji Roads in Zhabei District of this city were recently ordered to relocate by the Hengfeng Road Police Station, with a one-week deadline. The shantytown residents were shocked and terrified upon hearing this. They immediately elected Peng Yuanfeng, Liu Dongshan, Liu Zhaocai, Dong Xueshi, Cai Zhucheng, Miao Xiangben, Bu Shunchang, Yu Zuofa, Sun Langhong, Zheng Kaiju, and others as their authorized representatives. Yesterday, around 1 p.m., they led over a hundred men, women, children, and elderly people to the Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Social Affairs Bureau, and Public Security Bureau to appeal and deliver petition letters. Representatives from each government agency met with them and agreed to their requests. In addition to immediately ordering the police station to postpone the forced eviction, they also dispatched personnel to investigate the truth. The representatives were satisfied and then left. The petition letter from the shantytown representatives is transcribed below, regarding the excessive oppression and harsh eviction deadlines that are pushing over a thousand residents to their deaths. Please provide swift relief to alleviate their suffering. The shantytown residents previously appealed to the Hengfeng Road Police Station chief (unnamed) because he repeatedly sent police officers to their doors to order the demolition of their houses, dismantling beams and pulling down walls, causing great disturbance. Following an unfortunate incident of arson, the shantytown residents requested that your (department/government/bureau) convene thorough negotiations with the landlord, Gu Lanji (meetings held on February 15th and March 16th), and separately sent letters requesting direct discussions with the landlord (letters dated February 24th and March 11th). They also petitioned the Public Security Bureau. All of these actions have proof of receipt. The shantytown residents were quietly waiting for a resolution. Before your (department/government/bureau) could convene local authorities, the police chief suddenly issued a notice on the 11th of this month (photo attached), stating that the shantytown residents were occupying the land and obstructing other people's construction, and under the guise of cleaning up the city, ordered the shantytown residents to move out voluntarily within one week from the date of the notice. He also ordered police officers to forcibly evict them, even more harshly than before. Chief Lu summoned shantytown representatives Peng Yuanxiang, Miao Xiangben, Cai Zhucheng, and Yu Zuofa to the police station three times, severely reprimanding them and exerting his power to the fullest extent. The shantytown residents are all victims of disasters from various regions and bankrupt farmers who have no place to return. Moving to public civilian villages is not an option for the shantytowns due to difficulties in paying rent, finding shopkeepers to act as guarantors, and hindering their ability to find work. Moreover, the existing new villages are already full. If forced eviction proceeds, the shantytown residents will suffer from exposure to the elements, affecting their livelihoods, and the old and weak will perish in ditches, while the young and strong will resort to desperate measures. It is feared that instead of improving the city's appearance, it will affect social order. Furthermore, considering the thatched huts near Chief Lu's jurisdiction, there are no less than a hundred places, and some are closer and more relevant. Chief Lu does not prioritize those first, which shows his unfairness. Moreover, during this economic downturn, landlords in Shanghai are wary of building houses. Even if Gu Lanji needs the land for construction, the shantytown residents have requested negotiations multiple times, but they have been rejected. If there is an act of occupation, what legal protection is there? It is suspected that Chief Lu is acting as an accomplice and is oppressing the poor because there are unspeakable hidden motives. We further request that you investigate past construction on the land, including the design, purchase of materials, employment of labor, contracts, and other procedures. This will prove that the landlord is not really needing the land for construction and that some people are profiting from this situation. The shantytown residents' lives are at stake, and they are unwilling to be exploited by a few profiteers. Therefore, with tears, they implore your (department/government/bureau) to uphold your consistent principle of loving the people, promptly summon the local Gu Lanji and the shantytown residents to your (department/government/bureau) for face-to-face discussions to find a thorough solution. Send a letter to the Public Security Bureau, ordering Chief Lu to wait for a resolution and refrain from oppression, to alleviate the suffering and ensure social stability, which would be both a public service and a benefit.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Good News for Those Suffering from Heart Disease <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Progress in Electric Heart Testing</p>
<p>Diagnosis with Automatic Current Photography</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of Chinese people suffering from heart and vascular diseases has been increasing. Recently, Chairman Hu Zhentang also died from a circulatory disease. Dr. Ding Hui, MD and Lu Yihou, MD, recognizing the increasing severity of heart disease patients and the difficulty of diagnosis, visited renowned cardiology research institutes in Bad Nauheim, Germany, last spring, with the official mandate to study new medical technologies in Europe and America. They conducted an in-depth study of the latest electric cardiac automatic testing machine for researching heart disease. When a person's body is at rest, only the heart function generates activity. Current is introduced at both ends of the body and amplified. Any disturbances in the heart's stimulation function and the nerve conduction regulations can be captured using this automatic test to obtain a film photograph for accurate diagnosis. All circulatory diseases, such as arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure, or heart failure caused by kidney disease, diabetes, acute infectious diseases, lung disease, and opium addiction, can be diagnosed and treated using this machine to determine the course of the disease. It is truly good news for heart disease patients.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Austrian Automobile Travelers Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Ress and Hallmann</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," Austrian automobile travelers Ress and Hallmann, both from Vienna, departed from Vienna by car a year ago, intending to reach Shanghai in the shortest possible time. They traveled through good, bad, and nearly impassable roads, covering a total of 16,800 miles, and have now safely arrived in Shanghai. They now intend to return to their country by ship. They spent four months traveling through Palestine, Iraq, Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and India to Calcutta, covering approximately 9,000 miles. According to an interview with the "North China Daily News" yesterday (the 18th), this section of the journey was the safest of the entire trip. There were only one or two difficult spots in Afghanistan. Both believe that within a few years, traveling by car from India to Europe will be common. Most travelers circumnavigating the world ship their cars from Singapore to Saigon or another port in Vietnam. However, Ress and Hallmann claim to be the first to avoid this difficulty. They crossed the north of Indochina and the Quas and Annam provinces of Vietnam. They showed a document signed by a high-ranking official of the Vietnamese government as proof. However, that section of the journey was the most difficult. Trapped in dense forests with no roads, they were delayed and could only cover 120 miles. They needed the help of 30 coolies and spent a month and a half to complete it. In Quas, they had to disassemble the car to cross the strong currents of the Mekong River. They were grateful for the valuable assistance provided by the local chieftains. After traveling in China, they will forever have pleasant memories in their hearts. They were impressed by the progress of road construction in China. They entered China from Indochina, passing through Nanning, Guilin, and entering Hunan Province. The highway on the border of Guizhou and Hunan has not yet been completed, but with the assistance of local officials, they were able to cross the rice fields. Then they entered Jiangxi Province, touring Jingdezhen. They then took the route through Anhui and Zhejiang to reach Shanghai. The purpose of this long journey by car was to let the world know that there is a place called Austria, and they plan to bring back many films of scenic spots and report their experiences to the Austrian Travel Club. The car driven by one of them is novel in design, with larger wheels than ordinary ones, so that it can avoid getting stuck in mud and drive on rough roads. The car body is specially made for long-distance travelers. The oil tank can hold enough gasoline to travel 600 miles, and there is also a water tank that stores 18 gallons of water. This is Ress's third trip of this nature. In 1932, he traveled through the Sahara Desert, and from 1933 to 1934, he traveled from Europe to India, covering 8,000 miles. The two now plan to stay in Shanghai for about a week, then return to Vienna via the Suez Canal.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Former Deputy Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Wheelock, Passes Away in England <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wheelock, a British national and a well-known tea merchant in Shanghai, had been doing business in China for over thirty years. He had served as a director and deputy chairman of the Municipal Council. Wheelock recently passed away in England on the 15th of this month at the age of ninety-two. Wheelock came to China in 1864 and left in 1900 to return to England. He established his own company to trade tea and was also very enthusiastic about public affairs, serving as the secretary of the China Association for many years. His passing has been mourned by both Chinese and foreign friends. Wheelock has a son in Shanghai who is the general manager of the Exchange Bank of China. It is said that the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Arnold, has sent a letter to his son to express his condolences.</p>

<p>Due to Inadequate Road Construction Equipment, Their Husbands Died Tragically</p>
<p>On the morning of May 12th, around 4 o'clock, a car on Yangshupu Road drove into the Huangpu River, resulting in seven deaths by drowning. Now, the seven widows of these men have hired lawyer Roger to file a lawsuit against the Shanghai Municipal Council in the consular court, stating that due to the inadequate equipment after the Municipal Council constructed the road, those driving on the road were unaware of the extreme danger, and that area had become a "death trap" that had caused more than one accident. This accident resulted in as many as seven deaths, each with family members whose living expenses and education fees relied entirely on the deceased. The Municipal Council has an unshirkable responsibility and should compensate the families of the deceased for their losses. The amount of compensation demanded by each person varies, with a total of 188,734 yuan, plus court fees and a reasonable amount of lawyers' fees.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau and Health Bureau</p>
<p>Jointly Compile "Citizen Health Guidelines"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau believes that with the increasingly hot weather and the ease with which diseases can spread, citizens should pay special attention to hygiene to prevent the occurrence of illnesses. However, the general public in Shanghai often lacks awareness of hygiene, which is a regrettable deficiency. In light of this, the Public Security Bureau ordered its health and sanitation section to jointly compile a booklet of "Citizen Health Guidelines" with the Health Bureau and distribute it to the public, to ensure that citizens pay attention to hygiene to prevent the spread of diseases. It is planned that the health and sanitation police chiefs from each sub-bureau will visit households to provide guidance and propaganda before distributing the booklets. The bureau also believes that the health of its employees is crucial to the overall efficiency of the bureau's work. Therefore, the director of the health and sanitation section of the bureau has prescribed simple health check-up methods. Blood pressure tests are now being conducted, and other tests, such as parasite tests and bacterial tests, will also be carried out to allow those with illnesses to seek prompt treatment and those without illnesses to know what to pay attention to in order to improve their health.</p>
<p>The Fifteenth</p>
<p>Hygiene Campaign, Day Five</p>

They hired seven pediatric experts, including You Jihua, Hui Yaozhong, Fu Wenchou, Xu Naili, Chen Zhuoren, Chen Hongda, and Gao Zhonglang, to serve as judges. After the formal proceedings, Chairman Zhang Binghui reported, stating that children are the foundation of the nation and the future masters of the country. Therefore, to revitalize the nation and consolidate the foundation of the country, we must start by paying attention to children's health. The committee organized this event with this intention.</p>
<p>Winning Children</p>
<p>There were thirty children participating in the finals, divided into five groups. The first group included Jiang Nannan and four others; the second group included Zhang Ruolan and four others; the third group included Cai Shuihong and four others; the fourth group included Yu Mou-sheng and four others; and the fifth group included Lian Shixiang and four others.</p>
<p>Prizes</p>

<h3 id="e140">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee Member's Bribery Case: Zheng Chengqing Flees in Fear of Punishment, Zhang Bofang Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>With a fine of 500 yuan and deprivation of public rights for five years. Bail granted during appeal period.</p>
<p>Zheng Chengqing, an Executive Committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, fabricated a dispatch order in the name of Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, falsely claiming that the Party and National flags manufactured by the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company used Japanese materials. He instructed Zhang Bofang to take the document to the company's General Manager, Zhang Rongchu, to intimidate and extort money. Zhang Rongchu reported the incident to the Chamber of Commerce, which investigated and verified the facts. The Chamber of Commerce resolved to revoke Zheng's position as an Executive Committee member, and Yu Zuoting, on behalf of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, filed a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Zheng and Zhang for forgery, intimidation, extortion, and damage to reputation. Zheng Chengqing, knowing that he could not escape punishment, fled before the court could detain him and has now been wanted. Zhang Bofang claimed that he was deceived by Zheng at the time, so he obeyed the summons and was taken into custody. He was released on bail of 10,000 yuan. The public trial of the case was held yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. Zhang, accompanied by his defense lawyer Fan Gang, appeared in court. Judge Jiang Shuzi ascended the first court, inquired about Zhang's age, occupation, and address, and then announced the verdict. The main text of the judgment stated that Zhang Bofang was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment for attempted extortion, with a fine of 500 yuan and deprivation of public rights for five years. If the fine is converted to forced labor, it will be calculated at three yuan per day. Other charges were dismissed. After reciting the judgment, Judge Jiang briefly explained the reasons for the conviction to the defendant in court, stating that the plaintiff had accused the defendant of three crimes. After investigation, it was determined that the purpose of using the forged private document was to intimidate and extort money. Therefore, the two crimes were related. Although the extortion was unsuccessful, the act of committing continuous crimes could not be denied. According to the law, both crimes were combined and the heavier punishment was applied. Regarding the charge of damaging reputation, the forged document was not publicly disseminated, so it was dismissed. If the defendant was not satisfied with the judgment, he could appeal according to the law. Lawyer Fan requested that the defendant be allowed to continue bail during the appeal period. Judge Jiang immediately ruled that the original bail would be granted. The bribery case involving the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee member, which had caused a sensation, came to a temporary end.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Zhou Baocai, the Main Suspect in the Assassination of Song Xihou, Has Been Arrested <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Zhou used to be a clerk in the Hergling Company and had a commission dispute of 500 taels with Song. However, I believe that he instigated the murder of Song. He resided at No. 10, Sida Village, Lane 142, Remi Road, French Concession. Song Xihou, a compradore of the Shanghai office of the British Hergling Company, a cotton yarn merchant, was suddenly visited by two thugs wearing suits and speaking with a northern accent on the morning of the 8th of this month at 11:20 a.m., claiming to be delivering a letter.</p>
<p>Under the Pretense of Visiting Song</p>
<p>They shot Song and his maid Du Chen, seriously wounding them. They died after ineffective medical treatment. Song's concubine Shao and another maid Yuan Xu were also shot and injured and are now being treated at Renji Hospital. The French Police Department has ordered the arrest of the murderers. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Zhou Buguang, the chief detective of the French Police Department, received a tip-off on the 18th and, together with Deputy Detective Qin Youyu and detectives Tao Ronglin and Dai Rongji, waited at the intersection of Dongxinqiao Street and Ningbo Road at 2 p.m. that afternoon and arrested Zhou Binyi Cai (also known as Chunfeng, 48 years old), a native of Ningbo and a major suspect in this case. He was taken to the police station. Zhou confessed that he lived at No. 10, Bing'an Lane, Elaige Road, Zhujiaqiao. He used to be a clerk at the Hergling Company. After the company closed, he worked as an accountant in the tea hall for the female entertainers at the Guangming Theater in the New World Amusement Park. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the interrogation. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuang of the Police Department stated the case, saying that the defendant was arrested for</p>
<p>Inciting Murder</p>
<p>The Police Department is still conducting a detailed investigation and requested a postponement to investigate the matter before formally prosecuting it. Detective Tao Ronglin then reported that the defendant had been a clerk when the victim Song Xihou's father was a compradore at the Hergling Company, until Song Xihou took over and the company closed down. It was found that the defendant and Song Xihou had previously colluded in the sale of machinery with a commission of 5,000 to 6,000 taels, and the defendant was entitled to 500 taels. However, when the company closed, this amount had not been obtained. The defendant often went to Song's house to demand it. Song agreed to give him 400 yuan, but later refused to pay it because the defendant spoke badly. The defendant also went to Song's new residence in Sida Village to demand the money.</p>
<p>At the Time of Song's Murder</p>
<p>The two assailants in suits said to Song, "Why haven't you paid me the 400 yuan? I'm going to kill you." The letter held by the assailants was signed and stamped by Xu Qianlin, a well-respected figure in Shanghai, and it was Xu's stationery. After inquiring with Xu, the stationery and seal matched Xu's, but I believe that the letter must have been forged by someone else. When the assailants entered Song's back door, they told the maid that Mr. Xu had a letter and wanted to see Mr. Song about buying machinery. After investigation, various clues suggest that the defendant is related. The interrogation revealed that defendant Zhou Baocai admitted that he did indeed have a commission dispute of 500 taels with Song, but denied instigating the murder of Song. The court approved a postponement to investigate the case further. The defendant was taken back into custody.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Pan Jingwen's Case of Illegal Confinement in a Mental Hospital; Defendant's Appeal Rejected <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Pan Sues Hospital Director Gu Wenjun Separately for Illegal Detention; Defendant Absent from Yesterday's Trial Due to Arrears in Rent</p>
<p>Pan Jingwen, a female staff member from Tianjin at the Hongkou Maternity Hospital, had a deteriorating relationship filled with mutual suspicion after marrying Jin Youshan, a Korean manager of the Jin Tuo Fountain Pen Factory. Jin colluded with staff at the Shanghai Mental Hospital on Kang Nao Road, claiming that Pan Jingwen suffered from mental illness. They forcibly took her by car to the hospital, where she was illegally confined and beaten. After Pan reported this to the police, she filed a public prosecution against the hospital's doctor, Chu Jiqun, and nurses Gao Xinkui, Yang ★gou, and Li Amao. The First Special Court initially sentenced Chu and the other three to two months in prison each, with an attached civil suit transferred to the civil court. Chu Jiqun and others, dissatisfied with the first instance verdict, appealed to the High Court's branch, and the questioning has also concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu presided over the court and announced the verdict, rejecting the appeal. Yang ★gou and Li Amao were granted a two-year suspended sentence each, and the appeal on the attached civil suit was rejected. However, Pan Jingwen, believing that the director of the Shanghai Mental Hospital, Gu Wenjun, was also involved in the case, hired lawyer Zhang Baotang to file a private prosecution with the First Special Court's criminal division, accusing Gu Wenjun of illegal detention. The complaint stated that during the repeated trials of the Chu Jiqun case, the defendant Gu Wenjun repeatedly requested the police to file a public prosecution, but the police cited considerations as a reason and never prosecuted. Recently, the plaintiff entrusted lawyer Zhang to represent her and requested the Bureau of Public Works' legal department to prosecute in writing. The reply stated that she should file a lawsuit with the court herself. The defendant was indeed present at the scene, directing Gao Xinkui and others to detain and beat the plaintiff, which constitutes a violation of Articles ★9, 3★★■, and 2★■7 of the criminal law. Therefore, the prosecution was filed. Yesterday ★ afternoon, at 3:30 PM, Judge Huang Risheng ascended to the bench in Criminal Court No. 8 to summon the defendant, Gu Wenjun, who was absent. A lawyer appeared in court, stating that the Shanghai Mental Hospital run by Gu was in arrears of more than 3,000 yuan in rent and had been sued by the landlord, Ma Hongkui. A judgment had been rendered and was about to be executed, so Gu was currently negotiating terms with the landlord and was unable to attend court. The plaintiff, Pan Jingwen, also submitted a statement to the court, explaining everything. Judge Huang adjourned the case for seven days for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Qian Zhongdao Sued for Embezzlement and Breach of Trust; Clarification Based on Facts <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Mutual Understanding Regarding the Recovery of Stocks</p>
<p>Hearing Adjourned for Ten Days Pending Further Interrogation and Debate. The legal representative (liquidator) of the Zhengda Bank Liquidation Office (lawyer Wu Guochang), previously filed a complaint with the Second Special Court's criminal division, accusing lawyer Qian Zhongdao of embezzlement and breach of trust, and filed an attached civil suit to recover funds. Judge Li Changnian repeatedly opened court to summon the parties, but the matter was adjourned to a later date. Yesterday, the case was heard again. The plaintiff, Wu Guochang, was represented by a lawyer, while the defendant appeared in court with his defense lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Deng Jiabing. According to the defendant's defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, the case was actually a civil matter of debt. Wang Wenzhi, the manager of Zhengda Bank, previously commissioned the defendant to handle the execution of the Guo Xuanji mortgage debt case, receiving a total of 18,000 yuan. Of this amount, 11,800 yuan was successively delivered to Wang Wenzhi's representative, Zheng Binsen, leaving a balance of 6,200 yuan. After deducting the defendant's legal fees of 2,200 yuan, there was still a shortage of 4,000 yuan. At that time, during the reorganization of Zhengda Bank, a shareholder named Fu Tiezheng wanted to withdraw shares worth 3,000 yuan and contacted the defendant. The defendant discussed this with Wang Wenzhi, who verbally entrusted the defendant to recover the shares and consulted Zheng Baosen, Wu Zhihao, and Hong Yanbin. The defendant proceeded to spend 2,500 yuan to recover Fu's shares, with receipts from Fu and letters from Zheng Wu and others as evidence. Unexpectedly, Wang Wenzhi later denied the stock recovery. At that time, Zheng Shisen and Wu Zhihao had left Shanghai, and Wang urged the defendant to return the remaining 4,000 yuan, entrusting lawyer Zheng Wenkai to handle the matter. After lawyer Zheng's mediation, it was decided that the defendant's procedures for recovering the shares were incomplete, and the defendant was ordered to repay 4,000 yuan, pending Zheng Wu's return to Shanghai to resolve the stock matter. The defendant, respecting the friendship between teacher and student with lawyer Zheng, agreed to sign a contract, awaiting Zheng Wu's return to resolve the matter. The plaintiff then examined the previous accounts and filed a lawsuit. The lawyer stated that he had contacted the plaintiff, stating that the dispute was entirely civil in nature, so why was a criminal lawsuit filed? The plaintiff replied that based on the wishes of the party involved, Wang Wenzhi, the lawsuit was filed to save litigation costs and to expedite the resolution of the case. At noon today, the lawyer agreed with the plaintiff that the defendant would repay 1,500 yuan to settle the matter. The plaintiff has already agreed, he said, and submitted various exhibits to the court. The defendant's statement that he was entrusted by Zhengda Bank to handle the case and the details of recovering the stock were consistent with lawyer Chen's statement. The court questioned the plaintiff's representative lawyer accordingly, who stated that the amount of money and the details mentioned by the defendant were consistent, but that the lawyer did not know about the contact between lawyer Chen and the plaintiff to repay the money and requested a further adjournment to allow both parties to reconcile the civil suit outside the court. The court, after verifying the statements, stated that since the case was a debt dispute and the plaintiff was absent today, the case would be adjourned for another ten days, and a hearing would be held after the plaintiff arrived to make a statement, and then a debate would be opened. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Taikoo Company's Ship Sinks Sailboat, Drowning Seven <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Accident Occurs in the Copper Sand Waters off Wusong; Ningbo Native Association Dispatches Personnel to Negotiate</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the British Taikoo Company's Mlenhof ship collided with a sailboat off the Copper Sand waters outside Wusong on the 26th of last month, causing eight people to fall into the water. Only one person was rescued. Because the incident was not reported to the Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Customs, the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai only began to negotiate with the Taikoo Company yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sinking of Sailboat: Yu Shengcai, a boatman employed by Hu Shengneng's sand and stone company in this port (a Ningbo native), had an elder brother named Yu Shengmao, who owned a sailboat (valued at more than 5,000 yuan), which was used to transport yellow sand and gravel at sea for many years. At about 2:00 AM on the 26th of last month, the sailboat loaded yellow sand and gravel from Shanghai for export. When the ship passed through the Copper Sand waters outside Wusong, it encountered the Taikoo Company's Menhol ship (the ship did not sound its whistle). Because it was late at night, the sailboat was relying on wind power, making it difficult to maneuver. At that time, it was high tide and against the current, so it could not avoid the collision and immediately sank. All eight crew members fell into the water.</p>
<p>Seven Drown: Although the ship knew it had caused the accident and immediately had Western crew members use a longboat to rescue the victims, more than an hour had passed since the sailboat was hit and capsized, so only one crew member, Yu Xiaomao, was rescued. The other seven were nowhere to be found and drowned. Afterwards, although Yu Shengcai, the younger brother of the sailboat owner Yu Shengmao, requested the Yellow Sand and Stone Industry Association to come forward and negotiate with the Taikoo Company, the company only agreed to compensate each deceased person's family with 700 yuan in legal tender. The sailboat side refused to accept because the company would not compensate for the price of the boat and the amount of compensation for the families of the deceased was very small.</p>
<p>Negotiations and Condolences: The Shanghai Yellow Sand and Stone Industry Association, considering that the case involved many lives, did not want to ignore it. Yesterday afternoon, it sent a letter, accompanied by a sailboat owner and the families of the deceased, to the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai to describe the incident. The Association, upon receiving the report, felt that the matter concerned fellow villagers and was very pitiful, so it had dispatched personnel to handle the negotiations with the Taikoo Company with a letter stating the case. The text of the letter from the Native Association to the company is as follows: Our fellow villager Yu Shengmao's sailboat was sunk by the Blue Funnel Line ship (Menhof) on the 26th of last month at about 2:00 AM in the Qian Sha waters. Eight crew members were on board, one was rescued, and the rest were drowned. Yu Shengmao runs a small business and relies on the sailboat for a living. The boat is valued at more than 5,000 yuan. Now, unfortunately, his livelihood has been cut off. The families of the drowned are poor. The dead are gone, and the living have no one to rely on. It is truly pitiful. We have requested our Association to find a way. Therefore, we have sent staff member Zhang Ruihong to respectfully ask your company to have compassion on their misfortune and grant them generous compensation to maintain their livelihoods and comfort the spirits of the deceased. We deeply appreciate your generosity.</p>

<p>A Total of Fourteen Male and Female Kidnappers Captured; Are the Five Children the Offspring of the Bandits? On the morning of the 26th of last month, at around 7:00 AM, Dai Liu Haiyi, the grandson of Dai Keheng, of No. 20 Huaihuan Lane, Chang'an Road, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, was kidnapped by bandits. The bandits also shot and killed the accountant, Liu Zengshao. After the incident, Director Cai Jingjun strictly ordered the case to be solved within a time limit. Therefore, Captain Bao Ziying went out day and night to gather leads. The team had previously arrested seven accomplices, Ni Fugui, Yang Xiaohong, Wang, Wu Hongde, Yang Yuewen, Chen Changguo, and Yang Yiquan, in the French Concession and Zhabei Chinese area. A handgun and ten bullets were seized. The suspects confessed that the kidnapped victim was being held on a boat in Wuxi. The team had once rushed to Wuxi and searched for two days and nights, but the bandits had gotten wind of it and fled elsewhere, to no avail. Recently, Captain Bao received a tip that the kidnapped victim was being held at Yingguan Bridge, outside the west gate of Wuxi. Therefore, the captain quietly led Deputy Squad Leader Qian Tianxiong, Foremen Li Shouchun and Mao Gongzhao, Detectives Cai Jilin and Zhan, and Gao Changgui, a total of six people, to the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau on the afternoon of the 16th. Together with Detective Captain Zhong Jihe, Deputy Captains Tu Bingsheng and Dai Quan, and detectives, they rushed to Wugui Dun, Qishuyan, and other places near Yinglong Bridge. They captured the bandits Chen Daweizi and Chen Youfang and Sun Xiaolong. The kidnapped victim Dai Haiyi was rescued in Changzhou. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a detailed record of the items seized at that time. On the morning of the 18th, the team hired a motorboat and rushed to the destination. They saw a small boat. The bandit Chen Daweizi claimed that the kidnapped victim was hidden on the boat. However, the bandits hiding the kidnapped victim on the boat noticed that the boat behind them was suspicious. The bandits went ashore to escape. The pursuing detectives fired warning shots, ordering them to stop moving forward. Fortunately, there were no weapons on the bandit boat, so there was no resistance. Xia Shiwei (aka Xia Sigui), Guo Ruyang, and Xu Dapeng were arrested on the spot. They further confessed that the kidnapped victim was hidden on another small boat. The team immediately rushed there and found a small boat parked in a small river. The kidnapped victim Dai Haiyuan was found inside the boat. The guard Wang Dexiang, also known as Wang Da, and Wang's wife, Ni, were arrested. In addition to rescuing the kidnapped victim Dai Liu Haiyuan, there were also five men, women, and children of unknown origin on the boat. According to the bandit Wang and his wife, they were their children, named Wang Xiaozuizi, Wang Xiaoerzi, Wang Xiaosanzi, Wang Xiaosizi, and Wang Cuihua. There was also a bandit named Chen Lao. A total of ten men, women, and children were captured, along with the kidnapped victim, a total of fifteen people. They were all taken to the County Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. Captain Bao Ziying and others rushed back to Shanghai yesterday morning and reported to the Hengfeng Road Police Station, which forwarded the report to Team Leader Zhang of the Detective Brigade. In the afternoon, Captain Bao and others took a public document to the Changzhou County Government to escort the victim back to Shanghai for investigation.</p>

<p>Rumors Among Poor Residents in Small Houses: Four or Five Indians Were Playing Together</p>
<p>At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, an Indian male corpse was found on Song Park Road, Zhongxing Road, North Cemetery (commonly known as Huarntan), Zhabei. After reporting the incident, Yang Shouyan, an officer from the Zhongxing Road Police Station, and Police Chief Cheng Degui went to investigate and confirmed the report. The deceased had four or five gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen and was lying in a pool of blood. He was wearing a yellow uniform and a yellow cloth wrapped around his head. After investigation by the police station, the deceased was identified as Bie Qingsheng, 45 years old, a volunteer police officer at Gonghe Wharf under the jurisdiction of the Yangpu Police Station of the Public Concession. The police station immediately informed the Yangpu Police Station to send personnel to the scene to identify the body and transport it to the morgue for examination. In the deceased's pocket, two civil summons from the Special District Court were found, one of which was for a hearing today. Unexpectedly, he died tragically. A letter, twenty yuan in paper money, and a volunteer police card from Gonghexiang Wharf were also found and taken away. According to the poor residents living in the nearby small houses, they saw four or five Indians playing there at around 5:00 PM the day before. They did not know how the murder occurred that night. According to passersby, the deceased was a moneylender and had grudges with the poor. He was lured to the area and killed. Another rumor stated that it was due to jealousy. It is unknown which is true.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Lecturer of Stories and Novels, Blind Man Induces and Rapes Teenage Girl <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Sleeping Together in the Same Bed, Wife Took Photos; Scar on Lower Body Can Be Found as Ironclad Proof Yu Mengfei, a wealthy local resident of Hejia Lane, Wu Yuan Road, inside Xiaoximen, is blind. He was recently sued by Zhou Wang, a woman living on Fumin Road in the city, for inducing and raping her 17-year-old daughter, Jian Yaqin, also known as A Jin. The woman stated that in April 1934, her daughter was induced and raped by Yu Mengfei. According to A Jin, she first met the defendant at her sister's house and was repeatedly induced. He invited her to his house to lecture stories and novels. A Jin was deceived and went to the defendant's house for the first time with the defendant's nephew, Cai Yaochang. She was kept overnight at Yu's house. In the middle of the night, she was forcibly raped in her sleep. The defendant then sweetened the deal by promising to marry her. He asked her to come and go. If she did not go for a few days, he would send someone to call her. He also incited her to escape to the defendant's house before the Dragon Boat Festival and hide there for several months. On the morning of the 10th of November, his wife came to Shanghai and discovered the situation. On the morning of the 16th, the defendant was sleeping in bed with her, and his wife took photos. On December 13th, the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Penglai Road Police Station were notified and arrested him for questioning. He was then released. When she went home to get clothes, the defendant's wife and several thugs chased her out. The defendant also echoed her words and abandoned her. She is requesting that he be punished under Articles 240-13 of the Criminal Code. He was summoned and ordered to reconcile. Zhou Yaqin also testified that the defendant had sores and buboes on his lower body, which could be found as ironclad evidence. Therefore, Judge Wu opened court yesterday morning to hear the case again. The defendant said that he was blind and never left his wife's side, so how could he have induced and raped her? He also said that the girl was his mother's foster daughter. The judge said, "If you didn't induce and rape her, how would you know about the disease on your lower body?" He replied, "I have dampness, and my wife washes and applies medicine to me every day, so I know about it." The judge ordered a medical examiner to examine his lower body and adjourned the case for further hearing.</p>

<p>Dong Changchang and Wang Zhuxian Not Guilty; Gu Shenbao's Complaint Requires Investigation Dong Chengzhi, Dong Changchang, and Wang Zhuxian, all natives of this county, are regular customers of the Silver Star Dance School at No. 571, Tengfeng Lane, No. 592 Sichuan Road. After work, they often went to the school to dance. On the 11th of this month, the three men went to dance again and did not go downstairs until 11:20 PM. However, the school's tea servant, Gu Shenshi, suddenly chased after them downstairs, saying that Dong Chengzhi's overcoat was exchanged with another guest's overcoat by mistake and asked him to go upstairs to correct it. This led to an argument and then a fight. At this time, Gu Shenshi's face was suddenly cut with a knife, and blood flowed all over his face. After the police arrived, they took everyone to the General Police Station. A small knife was found in Gu Shenbao's hand. According to Gu, the injury to his face was caused by Dong Chengzhi stabbing him with the knife, which he snatched away. The police then prosecuted the three men for assault. After the court's investigation, the case was adjourned. Dong Changchang and Wang Zhuxian were each allowed to post bail of 100 yuan, and Gu Shenshi was sent to the medical examiner for examination. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Qian Hongye of the First Special Court opened court to continue the investigation. The medical examiner's report had already been submitted. According to the German doctor's examination, the knife wound suffered by Gu Shenbao was determined to have been self-inflicted. Dong Chengzhi only admitted to punching Gu Shenbao in the nose once and denied stabbing him with a knife. Dong Changchang and Wang Zhuxian both denied committing the crime. After the police lawyer Wang Yaotang and the defendant's lawyer argued, Judge Qian announced the verdict in court: Dong Chengzhi was found guilty of causing bodily harm and fined five yuan. Dong Changchang and Wang Zhuxian were found not guilty. The small knife was to be kept in storage. Because Yuan Shenbao was suspected of making a false accusation, the police were ordered to investigate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to Xiaoshijie and Fu'an Recreation Ground, stating that Siming Opera, originally named Ningbo Tanhuang, is the most obscene type of opera. It is still banned in its place of origin, Ningbo, and is not allowed to be performed. The Bureau, in consideration of the livelihoods of Siming Opera performers throughout the city, repeatedly ordered them to improve within a limited time. However, after several years, it remains the same. Therefore, in order to maintain public morals, it has been decided to strictly prohibit it across the board, starting with the urban area. In addition to sending separate letters to the Public Security Bureau, the Bureau hereby orders the Recreation Ground to stop performing Siming Opera upon receipt of this order and not to violate it.

<h3 id="e151">Wu Liande Forms Chinese Cremation Association <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Delivers Speech at Capital Hotel Yesterday Datong News Agency reports that Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the National Maritime Quarantine Service, is extremely enthusiastic about promoting cremation. He has now been hired by the Municipal Government as a member of the Shanghai Cremation Ground Construction Committee. Yesterday afternoon, at the invitation of the Rotary Club, he delivered a speech at the Capital Hotel on the need to promote cremation. The gist of his speech is as follows: Cremation has existed in China since ancient times. Mozi's "On Frugal Burials" advocates cremation. During the Han Dynasty, Buddhism flourished, and cremation became popular. However, Confucianism advocated that the body and hair are received from one's parents and should not be destroyed. As a result, cremation suffered a setback. As a result, one-eleventh of the country's arable land is occupied by graves and tombs. To this day, the country's food supply cannot be self-sufficient and must rely on others. The economic loss is incalculable. To realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood, it is also necessary to promote cremation. In Shanghai alone, there are many coffins and tombs in the suburbs. This is not only unsightly but also unsanitary. Mayor Wu, in view of this, has established the Shanghai Cremation Ground Construction Committee to promote cremation. The committee held its first meeting on the 11th of this month and decided to select public land in front of the Jiangsu Shanghai Municipal Cemetery as the site, covering Nian Mu. The construction cost is tentatively set at 40,000 yuan. In addition to asking the Municipal Government to contribute 30,000 yuan, the remaining 20,000 yuan is to be raised by charitable organizations and enthusiastic individuals in the port. In addition, I am working hard to prepare to organize the Chinese Cremation Association to promote cremation. The association's goals include five items: 1. To promote hygienic, economical, and aesthetic burial methods. 2. To assist the government and the people in using the land currently occupied by graves for agricultural production, so that the government can obtain tax revenue and the people can obtain income. 3. To cooperate with local governments to establish aesthetic cremation grounds to meet the needs of those who wish to be cremated and to suit China's inherent customs and traditions. 4. To work hard to publicize the benefits of cremation. 5. To find ways to contact similar organizations in various countries. In the future, after the association is established, it is hoped that enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life will join the association.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Telephone Council Suggests to Chamber of Commerce: Fight Price Increase <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Telephone is a Public Utility; Strive for Universality, Otherwise Telephone Rates Will Increase and Users Will Decrease. The Shanghai Special District Telephone Council, considering that the Shanghai Telephone Company is implementing price increases in the current recession, which has caused social unrest, has suggested to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which is holding its general membership meeting today, that it present the price increase issue for discussion and adopt the proposed resolution. The original text is as follows: Sirs, since the Shanghai Telephone Company, in the current recession, presumptuously hopes to satisfy its desire for an annual interest rate of 1%, it has illegally raised prices, causing social unrest. Considering that telephone is a public utility and a tool for communication, we should strive for universality and adopt the principle of low price and high volume. Even if the company is concerned with its business, it should profit from volume. Otherwise, telephone rates will increase, and the number of users will decrease. As a result, commerce will be restricted, and the company will fail. Since the implementation of the new price increase regulations, the company's telephone directory for the winter of the year before last contained 488 pages, while the telephone directory for the spring of this year contained only 426 pages. With 76 households per page, the number of users who have removed their telephones this year due to being unable to afford the increase is 4,500. This figure does not include those who removed their telephones after the directory was printed. The company's statement that several thousand users have automatically requested installation after the implementation of the new regulations is simply deception. This fact proves that the Council's statement that the more the telephone rates increase, the fewer the number of users, is true. Furthermore, according to reports from users in various districts, the meter readings are inaccurate, with the number of calls being recorded more than a hundred times. This extra sacrifice will affect the company's reputation. Your Chamber is the commercial center of the city, and the increase in telephone rates is of direct interest to all members. The Council has conducted a thorough study of the issue and has proposed the following measures for the general meeting to discuss and adopt to facilitate resolution: 1. Whether for basic calls or excess calls, charge 2 cents per call. However, in consideration of the company's business, commercial telephones must have a minimum monthly basic charge of 10 yuan, and residential telephones must have a minimum monthly basic charge of 6.5 yuan. 2. The call charges between the Special District and the city should be eliminated. 3. For the sake of credibility, each telephone should be equipped with a meter. 4. Once the company's income exceeds the annual interest rate of 1%, the Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works should convene a meeting to discuss a reduction in rates. 5. The above measures should be implemented for a trial period of one year. If the company does not accept these measures, then the various trade associations should instruct their members to stop paying their bills and allow their telephones to be removed. In addition, a request should be submitted to the central government to issue public bonds and take over the telephone company. If we proceed in this manner, it will be easier to resolve the issue. Furthermore, the implementation of the above improvement measures will inevitably attract more users. This is necessary for the company to ensure its development. Therefore, we respectfully submit our views to your Chamber for consideration and adoption for the benefit of all users in the city.</p>

<h3 id="e191">School Investigation: An Overview of the Shanghai Jewish School (Part 1) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jewish School is located at 544 Seymour Road in the Western District of the Public Concession. The school is large in scale and well-equipped. This article is based on materials provided by Ms. Solomon, the principal of the school, and we are very grateful for her donation of a booklet outlining the school's general situation.</p>
<p>I. The Largest Jewish School in the Far East</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jewish School was founded in 1902 with the purpose of providing Jewish children with a sound education that would enable them to adapt to the struggles of life, become self-respecting young men and women, and good citizens. The school initially held classes in a bungalow in Hongkou, with fewer than ten students enrolled at that time. The curriculum consisted only of English and Hebrew. Later, the school gradually developed and expanded, and by 1930, the total number of students had increased to about one hundred. However, the school buildings were small and the facilities were simple, while the number of students was very large, so the Municipal Council considered it quite dangerous and often hoped that the school would relocate.</p>
<p>At this time, an Englishman named Isaac S. Perry passed away. In his will, Perry designated a donation of 150,000 taels of silver for the construction of a new school building for the Jewish school, provided that the Jewish people in Shanghai raise an equal amount of funds to serve as a school maintenance fund. Soon, the school maintenance fund was raised by the Jewish people, and a plot of land at 544 Seymour Road, next to the Jewish synagogue, was purchased to begin construction of the new school building. The new school building was completed in 1931, and all students then moved into the new school building to attend classes.</p>
<p>The new school building was designed and supervised by the Jewish engineer C. H. Gonda. The entire school building can be said to represent the most modern school in the Far East. All sanitary and hygiene facilities are modern. The corridors and classrooms on all levels are spacious, bright, and well-ventilated. According to the principal, many public and private schools often send people to visit the school when constructing their own school buildings, in order to learn from it. The entire school building can accommodate 300 students and is the largest Jewish school in the Far East. The school currently has three departments: middle school, elementary school, and kindergarten, and accepts both male and female students. There are approximately 250 students in total. Many Jewish children residing in North China or abroad also wish to attend the school.</p>
<p>II. School Buildings and Facilities</p>
<p>The school building is 口-shaped and has two floors. The entire building is constructed with steel and cement and is quite sturdy. The school building is surrounded by gates or side doors leading to the outside, making it very convenient for students to enter and exit. On the lower floor of the school building, near the west entrance, are the principal's office and the infirmary. To the left is the auditorium, and opposite the main entrance are the student dining hall and kitchen. To the right are the kindergarten, lower grade classrooms, and elementary school toilets. Sand filtration water pipes are installed along both sides of the corridor. Upstairs are the upper grade and middle school classrooms, art room, library, girls' sewing room, classroom office, storage room, etc. There is no student laboratory or science room, which is a slight imperfection. The music room is combined with the auditorium for joint use. The sports field is 150 feet long and 85 feet wide and has two basketball courts, two playgrounds, one handball court, and two large sandboxes. Students can also use the open space next to the synagogue.</p>
<p>The facilities in each classroom are quite perfect. There are a total of nine ordinary classrooms: each elementary school classroom can accommodate 45 students, and each middle school classroom can accommodate 25 students. Each classroom is connected to the corridor and is mostly south-facing. The light enters from the left side. Blackboards are installed on the side of the classroom where the light is concentrated. All classrooms use steel windows that can be opened in three places. There are two vertical window doors in the middle and one horizontal transom window at the top and bottom. Therefore, windows can be opened for ventilation even in the severe winter weather without causing students to catch a cold. The curtains are either automatic roller blinds or beaded curtains.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Finance: Many Parties Taking Profits at High Levels; Bid Price Falls Back 2.5 Yuan <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a decline as the situation improved, and buyers waited and watched, leading many parties to take profits. The market lacked substantial support and turned downwards, but there was considerable fluctuation in the middle, and the trend was uncertain. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw London down and the US flat. "Big Feet" (market players) said that after the market closed, there were a few large transactions below the listed price of 0.625, leading to market fatigue. Forward silver prices remained unchanged or were down 0.05. Exchange rates all increased. London gold rose by 4 pence. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened at 42 yuan. Dingkang, Fuxingyong, Xiangfeng, Yuanmaoyong, and Qingfayong were offloading. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates showed the UK and US unchanged, Customs Gold Unit (關金) up 0.04. The standard bid price was listed at 1126.9 yuan, still falling within 40 yuan, at 39.5 yuan. Dadecheng bought in at low prices and pulled the price up slightly, starting a low trading range. After the market opened, major players supplied heavily. Although there was considerable fluctuation in the middle, the market sentiment did not improve, so even though the HSBC listed rates for the UK and US were flat, prices still declined. Although there was a rebound at one point, it was difficult to rise again due to the silver equalization tax of 0.075. Soon, the market fell again due to more sellers.

<h3 id="e194">Securities: Government Bonds Rebounded Yesterday <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the activity of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was extremely fierce. The market price experienced a sharp rebound from the evening trading session after a period of continuous decline. Market rumors were extremely chaotic. Initially, it was said that the actions of the "變方" (rebellious side) seemed to be not far from contact, but in the evening, it was suddenly rumored that the Gui Army had withdrawn. The news was contradictory and changed rapidly. The manipulation tactics of speculators were said to be extreme. However, with only two days remaining in the current month, a short squeeze was inevitable if the news could not improve slightly. Among the buyers of this month who delivered goods, E bonds were the most common. In these next day or two, there could still be rapid and unpredictable changes. The market yesterday opened with retail investors covering shorts and Number 23 buying in considerably. The market price rose sharply by 0.03 to 0.065 yuan. In the second session, Number 48 continued to sell, and Number 54 also released stocks, and the market price fell back by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. In the afternoon, the release of stocks by long investors became increasingly widespread. Numbers 10, 11, 35, and 48 all sold out consistently. Buyers were scarce, and the market price continued to plummet by 0.12 to 0.16 yuan. At the close, the market initially continued to weaken, with E bonds falling slightly by 0.035 yuan, and long-term C bonds rose sharply by 0.03 yuan due to the actions of Numbers 16 and 33. Starting with B bonds, Number 47 suddenly covered a large number of shorts, followed by Numbers 33, 43, and 79, who followed the trend and tried their best to cover, believing that the news obtained by Number 47 was relatively accurate, but this may not have been consistent with the facts. Numbers 4, 5, 11, 23, and 48 took the opportunity to sell at high prices and release stocks, and the amount was also significant, and the market price was raised by about 1 yuan. It is difficult to be optimistic about the future because it is not only related to the abnormal actions of the Southwest region. As a result, only the current month's E bonds and丙 bonds fell slightly by 0.015 to 0.005 yuan, and the rest all trended upwards. A and B bonds rose the most by 0.08 yuan. The total number of transactions was 11,375,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn and cloth market changed several times a day, and the situation became more chaotic. The price of raw cotton trended upwards, and there were rumors of a short squeeze, causing fluctuations in cotton yarn. However, the current yarn business did not show any healthy momentum, and the yarn stockpiled in the yarn and cloth warehouses still had no ability to move. Therefore, those who went long had little interest. The second session opened in the afternoon with a crazy jump, followed by a massive short sale by a certain factory, and a certain company vigorously throwing out. The closing price suddenly fell.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Uniquely Rises in the Current Month</p>
<p>In the morning opening of the spot yarn market, overseas yarn and cotton conditions were slightly down, and all months saw a return to flat, falling by 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan. The second and third sessions were still normal. By the third closing session, due to the crazy jump in raw cotton, market sentiment was excited, causing the related yarn market to rise in response. All prices in the third session rose by 0.08 to 0.09 yuan to 1 yuan. As a result, the near months fell by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the distant months rose by 0.02 to 0.04 yuan. The market atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic at the opening of the afternoon session. Buyers flocked in, completely driven by the cotton market. However, Dafu and others tried their best to sell, and the amount was exceptionally large. However, the second session still rose, and distant months saw high prices of 6 yuan to 6.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the third closing session, the astronomical decline風驟起 (wind suddenly arose), according to the market, a certain factory had sufficient inventory of Earth yarn and was selling short in the distant months, and Gengfeng also came to unwind, causing the market to suddenly loosen, and the market price turned downwards. The September futures fell sharply by 1.7 yuan compared to the third session. As a result, the current month rose by 0.04 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months fell by 0.04, 0.09, 0.08 yuan to 1.1 yuan. Dafu sold 5550 bales, Hexing 1250 bales, Gengfeng 2650 bales, Taichang 2550 bales, Runkang 1200 bales, Yuda 700 bales, Yichang 800 bales, Xiecheng 1150 bales, and Tongji 800 bales.

<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. As a result, the current month was still expensive. As the delivery period approached, the cotton that passed the inspection at the cotton inspection office was not very enthusiastic, so rumors of a short squeeze became prevalent again, and floating accounts showed signs of panic again. The current month jumped to over 5 yuan. The momentum was strong at the opening of the afternoon session, and the closing price was slightly weak and turned downwards.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton陳漲 (old up) and New Down: In the morning opening of the spot cotton market, overseas Indian and American cotton markets turned downwards, and the situation was peaceful. New cotton fell by 0.01 yuan. Unexpectedly, the buying interest in the current month suddenly tightened in the second and third sessions. Although buyers were not enthusiastic, sellers were scarce, and the reason was that foreign cotton had been rising continuously, and some cotton merchants rumored a short squeeze, causing floating accounts to move. By the closing session, the price suddenly jumped by 0.03 yuan. As a result,陳花 (old cotton) rose by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and new cotton rose by 0.005 to 0.01 yuan. The old cotton jumped by another 0.02 yuan at the opening of the afternoon session due to the residual momentum of the noon closing. The July futures reached a high price of 5.75 yuan in the second session. After the second session, a large number of old longs unloaded and the price plummeted. The downward trend of new cotton was even more severe. As a result, the current month fell by 0.005 yuan compared to the morning closing, and the rest all fell by 0.025 to 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Gengfeng sold 12,100 dan, Hexing 7,700 dan, Yukang 4,800 dan, Xinchang 2,400 dan, Tongji 1,500 dan, Yuanyi 2,100 dan, Taichang 3,900 dan, Runkang 9,700 dan, Changhe 4,100 dan, Yuanda 2,800 dan, Juju 2,000 dan, Shenji 3,500 dan, and Jinghua 2,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with prices ranging from unchanged to a fall of 0.04 pounds. In the early morning, the cotton hoarding agency sold about 30,000 bales of July futures at 11.9 cents, all of which were absorbed by the industry. However, apart from new cotton, there was not much demand from traders who had already sold. There was some small buying, and prices rose again. Current needs were urgent and activity was high, but buying and selling were very limited. Before the close, market prices gradually strengthened. The industry was mostly waiting for news of the sale of new borrowed cotton. Spot prices rose by 0.06 points, and futures prices fell by 0.01 to 0.02 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying by futures traders, brokers, and short sellers, but then fell back due to selling by Japanese merchants and profit-taking by long investors. Pingguo rose by 1 rupee and fell by 0.75 rupee, Aomula fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupee, and Bai Luoxi rose by 0.5 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 18th).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market had a good atmosphere due to active real sales. Factory prices rose rapidly, and the market atmosphere became more prosperous with the help of stable yarn and thread prices. Customers found plain Yankee yarn to be the most popular. Downstream Yankee yarn buyers from the Ningbo region showed a strong interest in purchasing, and they added purchases every day. The inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were also active, resulting in the high demand for various plain Yankee yarn types on the market. Over 300 pieces of light and heavy coarse cloth were traded in this street. Buyers from Tianjin also showed good interest, buying nearly 300 bales. Sales in Yantai were not good, but Qingdao was very active, buying over 200 pieces of white coarse cloth, colored貢呢, 嗶嘰, blue cloth, 斯林布 (shilin cloth). Sichuan continued to buy colored cloth, and prices rose by 0.01 yuan per piece due to increased real sales. The Yangtze River, such as the Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui regions, still had purchasing power. Buyers from Guangdong had some interest in purchasing fine twill from this factory, buying over 200 pieces of cheap goods from the factory. Four Gentlemen 嗶嘰 were affected by the rising thread prices, and the price continued to rise by 0.00125 yuan per yard. The direct 貢 of 嗶嘰 from this factory also rose by 0.0025 to 0.005 yuan.</p>

<p>As a result, the Shanghai silk market was very lifeless, and buyers seemed to have enough supply, so there were no more transactions.</p>

Other brands, such as Rui Ji, Yu He, Da Li Da Ji, Hua Ming, and Cai Ji, ranged from 12.55 yuan to 12 yuan. It is heard that the Shantou exchange rate has risen again, fluctuating above 20 yuan, and the Chaozhou Qing sugar market does not quite match this price. Red and white sugar merchants are still continuing to operate, and it will not be easy for prices to fall quickly.</p>
<p>The company formed jointly reached its third bid exchange period this week. The total fixed amount for Wu Yang coarse white sugar and others was 9,776 packages. The bid price was slightly lower by one or two jiao, which improved market demand.

<p>East White Iron Competitive Sales Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Recently, the Association's 200-pound American iron has been purchased in large quantities by canning factories, and prices have soared. Previously, each box was 7.2 gold yuan, but now it requires 7.5 gold yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai market price has also been driven up. The current market price is 33 yuan per box, which is more than one yuan better than before. Although more than 1,000 boxes have been released in the city, buyers are still coming in an endless stream.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the Zhongshan and Asia factories competing to sell Dong White Iron, standard market prices have frequently declined. Currently, 3-foot, 7-foot sheets are sold at 9.6 fen per sheet, which is one fen less than before. Transactions on this street still have not improved much, but export transactions are still good. Customers from the Yangtze River area are all purchasing. Yesterday, a total of 3,000-4,000 sheets were loaded.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Grains: This Month's Flour Cornering Leads to a Sharp Rise of 24.5 Fen <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, there was an unbelievable cornering wave in the spot month market. The market surged suddenly, and the severity of the situation set an unprecedented record for the exchange market. The price was still calm at the time of the opening, with the thief price only 3.3 yuan. However, after the second session, due to short covering, the market gradually soared, and at the close, it reached 3.4425 yuan, a huge increase of 7-8 fen compared to the previous day's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, a certain bull suddenly rushed in, causing the shorts to be unable to cover, and the market presented a huge disturbance. Because the situation was serious, the board of directors temporarily suspended trading. After temporary mediation, the disturbance subsided, but the market remained high. Due to the lack of chips on the table and the reluctance of various factories, the cornering phenomenon that should not have occurred when the new wheat had already appeared was rare in the past. The final session soared to 3.52 yuan, a huge increase of 24.5 fen compared to the previous day, which is quite astonishing. (Spot flour is currently opening between 22-3 jiao.) In the forward months, it was initially good, but due to sales from the inland gang, it fell by about 1-2 fen in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Forward Wheat Falls Due to Actual Goods Being Sold as a Hedge <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market opened in the morning with a slight moderation in all months. Due to the gradual increase in arrivals, factories were generally watching and waiting. Therefore, although trading was lively, prices were generally flat, with only a 1-2 fen difference from the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, all months were initially calm, but due to customers selling actual goods as a hedge, and although the price of new wheat in various places was not low, the goods were increasing, so people's minds turned calm and fell by 2-3 fen. In the future, if the situation is compared with common sense, at the time when the new wheat enters the market, an annual low price should be expected. However, whether the deterioration that occurred in the flour market can be avoided depends on prudent management. The spot wheat market has slightly improved by 1-2 fen due to the recent rise in flour. Chen Wheat from Kai Yao Wan is priced at 4.6 yuan, Wheat from Huai'an Guan Dian is priced at 4.45 yuan, Wheat from Jiangbei is 4.4 yuan, Wheat from Gaoyou is 4.43 yuan, Wheat from Kou Kou is 4.38 yuan, Wheat from Danyang is 4.3 yuan, Wheat from Jue is 2.5 jiao, Wheat from Qishan is 4.21 yuan, Wheat from Jue is 0.06 fen, Wheat from Penglai is priced at 4.09 yuan, Wheat from Jue is 3.93 yuan, Wheat from Suzhou is 4.23 yuan, Wheat from Weiting is 4.15 yuan, Wheat from Ba Cheng is 4.05 yuan. Fuxin took 3,700 bags, Fufeng took 2,000 bags, and Shenda took 100 bags.</p>

<p>Cornerstone Laying Special Edition of Qiujiang Wharf</p>
<h3 id="e208">Introduction <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Xiangxi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Qiujiang Wharf will hold a cornerstone laying ceremony on June 20 and publish a special edition. Those in charge asked me to write an introduction. I think the origin of the Qiujiang Wharf and the process of years of preparation have been described in detail by those who are in charge, and there is no need for my wise words. However, at the beginning of this cornerstone laying, I would like to express my feelings to the people of the country. Since our country opened up to trade, ships have gathered, and various shipping companies have set up wharves on both sides of the Huangpu River as places for ships to berth, which has been the case for decades. However, due to the narrowness and shallowness of the river, it is very inconvenient to load and unload goods. The construction of the Qiujiang Wharf will greatly facilitate the transportation and storage of goods, and it will not be difficult to develop our overseas commerce. This is of great importance to the future of our country's international trade. This is the first thing that makes me happy. Shanghai's prosperity is concentrated in the concession area, and the urban area is declining day by day. Since the establishment of the municipal government and the implementation of the plan to prosper Greater Shanghai, the development of industry and commerce is the first priority. The establishment of the wharf will greatly contribute to the development of industry and commerce and will greatly benefit the prosperity of Greater Shanghai. This is the second thing that makes me happy. Transportation construction is the most important facility of the government in recent years, because it has a close relationship with other industries. In recent years, the government has established the Central Trust Bureau, and the Ministry of Industry has established various factories and markets. However, these cannot prosper without transportation. The establishment of the wharf is entrusted to the general industry and commerce. Therefore, the establishment of the wharf will greatly assist state-owned enterprises. This is the third thing that makes me happy. The hard work of those in charge for several years of preparation and the support of all parties to promote the success of this event are also what I am happy and grateful for. Today, on the day of the cornerstone laying, I have expressed my feelings as above. Gentlemen of the country, please give your advice!</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Relationship between Building Qiujiang Wharf and Prospering the Shanghai Urban Area <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>In the past, before the rise of railways and ships, the characteristic of all prosperous commercial places was "masts standing like forests," which shows that water transportation has long been related to the development of cities. Since the advent of railways, there have been tools on land that can carry heavy loads over long distances. Therefore, remote hinterlands have also become major towns due to factors such as terrain and products. For example, Berlin in Germany is not along the coast, nor is it traversed by giant rivers. It has become one of the world's largest cities solely because of its railway hub. However, waterway transportation is inferior to railways in terms of speed, but it has an advantage in terms of economy. Therefore, even in areas with crisscrossing railway tracks, waterway transportation cannot be abandoned. For example, of the 25 million tons of goods imported into Berlin each year, no less than 10 million tons come via canals. As for the actual sea points where ocean transportation gathers, namely the locations of so-called sea ports, waterway transportation is the lifeline for the development of industry and commerce. Its importance is greater than the railway transportation connecting the hinterland.</p>
<p>Shanghai is located at the mouth of our country's largest navigable river and is very close to the ocean. Its natural condition is suitable for forming a deep-water port. The 1.94 million square kilometers of land in the Yangtze River basin has a natural barrier and almost entirely uses it as a port for loading and unloading goods. In addition, most of the commerce in southern China passes through Shanghai due to the natural limitations of the hinterland and draft of the coastal commercial ports between Hong Kong and Shanghai. Also, due to the terrain, there are no deep-water ports in northern China that can be used, so all commerce is centered on Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai's position in ocean transportation can be said to be particularly superior.</p>
<p>In terms of inland river transportation, the waterway from Shanghai up the Yangtze River to Hankou is excellent. Ships with a draft of about 3 meters can pass in winter, and ships with a draft of about 9 meters can pass in summer. From Hankou upwards, special ships can be used to navigate 1,300 kilometers in summer. Most of the other larger tributaries are suitable for the navigation of sand boats and small ships. The import and export goods of the commercial ports near each tributary are concentrated in Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai's position in inland river transportation can also be said to be particularly superior.</p>
<p>From the above, the development of Shanghai from a small county town into a metropolis with a population of 3.5 million, the largest commercial port in our country, and one of the ten largest commercial ports in the world, is it accidental? However, if there had been no dredging of the Huangpu River and the equipment of wharves and ships, the benefits of water transportation would not have been obvious, and it would not have been possible to leap from a scattered fishing village to today's prosperous urban area in a few decades. From this, it can be seen that the prosperity of a place's industry and commerce depends not only on natural conditions and geographical advantages but also on human construction.</p>
<p>Shanghai's existing wharf facilities are the foundation of its previous prosperity, but compared with modern European and American seaports, they are still inferior in many ways. In particular, the lack of connection between water and land transportation makes it a major shortcoming, even though goods are concentrated from the interior or distributed to the interior via the Shanghai Railway, which is efficient and economical. Secondly, the total length of deep-water wharves with a depth of more than 9 meters (30 feet) below the lowest tide level is only about 3,100 meters, including both sides of the Huangpu River. Let's look at the Port of Hamburg, one of the major ports in Europe, where the length of wharves for seagoing vessels is no less than 35,000 meters. From this, it can be seen that the length of Shanghai's existing wharves is not enough to meet the needs of development. In recent decades, Shanghai's wharf facilities have not been significantly improved. If we remain complacent today, then in the long run, it will be as the report of the Shanghai Port Technical Advisory Committee in the tenth year of the Republic of China stated: "If the improvement project is not implemented, ships with deeper drafts will inevitably be attracted by foreign distribution centers, and Shanghai will be reduced to a second-class commercial port. Not only will the interests of this port be greatly damaged, but its impact will also affect the entire country!"</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to maintain and enhance Shanghai's prosperity, new construction related to water transportation, namely the expansion and improvement of wharf facilities, cannot be delayed. There have been plans to open the Wusong Commercial Port. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be realized in a short period of time. Therefore, the Central Bank has invested in the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf. After its completion in the future, the length of Shanghai's deep-water wharves can be increased by 1,400 meters. Even in the first phase of the project, it can be increased by 880 meters. The connection with roads and railways and the facilities for warehouses and freight yards have also been carefully planned. The improvement of the economic conditions of transportation between Shanghai and various places at home and abroad will be self-evident. The reduction of transportation costs is enough to promote the development of industry and commerce, and it can also indirectly increase the prosperity of the urban area. The distance between the city center and Qiujiang Wharf is far away, and it is the closest hinterland. Its serious development can be expected!</p>

<h3 id="e212">Construction Plan of Qiujiang Wharf <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Song Ziliang</p>
<p>In the spring of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, in order to develop international trade, support state-owned enterprises, and promote the prosperity of the Shanghai urban area, the Central Bank decided to build Qiujiang Wharf and warehouses to facilitate transportation. The wharf business is large in scale and the project is complicated. It is difficult to achieve effective assistance without gathering specialized talents to study together. Minister Kong had seen this, so on the fourth day of the month, he was ordered to form the Qiujiang Wharf Design Committee with Mr. Chen Jian'an, Ye Zhuotang, Mr. Cha Tingzhi (CHATLEY), Mr. Liu Hongsheng, and Ziliang. In May of the twenty-fourth year, Mr. Zhang Gongkuang and Mr. Xu Keting were appointed as members. In August of the same year, after the design work was completed, he was ordered to reorganize the Design Committee into a Construction Committee, with the same members. With the elegant intentions of the members, he was elected as the chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>Looking back since receiving the order, it will be two years in an instant. The responsibility is heavy and the talent is shallow, and there is always the fear of falling. Fortunately, Minister Kong's guidance and the assistance of the members are always obtained. Although there is no special achievement in the wharf work, on the occasion of its scale, the motives for construction, the outline of the plan, and the contents of the first phase of the wharf project, etc., are briefly described below:</p>
<h3 id="e213">Chairman of the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee Song Ziliang <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>(1) Motives for Building the Wharf</p>
<p>The Huangpu shore near the Qiujiang estuary in the Yinhang District of Shanghai has long been regarded by the navigation industry and the League of Nations investigation team as an ideal wharf area, suitable for the construction of docks and wharves. Its shoreline is long and straight, the river water is deep and wide, and the ships are safer and more convenient to travel and berth than other areas of the Huangpu River. In particular, it is close to the commercial and industrial center of Greater Shanghai, which will have a great relationship with the development of international trade and the transit of import and export goods in the future. Ships now berth here, and when importing and exporting, they pass the Shentan outside the Wusong Estuary without having to wait for the tide to rise and fall, and can sail freely. It is found that the rented areas along the Huangpu River are narrow, the water volume is low, and various large and small ships gather in them, which is very crowded. The shipping routes of heavy mail ships are too narrow, which makes it inconvenient to travel in them, and it is easy to encounter unexpected events if you are not careful. If there is a wharf at the Qiujiang estuary where ships can berth, this dangerous and time-consuming voyage can be avoided, which is convenient for cargo transportation and saves costs. This is because of the superior natural conditions that are suitable for the construction of the wharf.</p>
<p>Moreover, the wharf business has a great impact on the prosperity of the market. All industries such as transportation, transportation, finance, insurance, etc. can rely on it to flourish. Once the wharf is established, the prosperity of the city center can be expected in the near future. For this reason, we resolutely decided to build this wharf.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Member of the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee Zhang Gongquan <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>(2) Outline of the Wharf Construction Plan</p>
<p>The above-mentioned land is located at Huangpu No. 90, Shangzi, north of the Qiujiang estuary, about 800 mu of beach land, and about 300 mu of land in the Zhou Yi San Liang maps. It has been purchased and filled to 19 feet above the Wusong estuary level, and can be used to build a wharf and warehouses with a length of about 3,000 feet and a width of about 1,000 feet. Such a large area must be based on predicting the future number of industries and on the principle of not damaging the interests of investment. The system for planning and proceeding is to select the important plots among them and build them in stages, so as to conform to the principles of economy and achieve the purpose of investment.</p>
<p>The entire wharf plan is divided into three phases. In the first phase, two wharves will be built first, each with a length of 590 feet, which can accommodate the largest mail ships, such as the Empress of the Changxing Shipping Company and the President of the Da Lai Shipping Company. Two two-story steel-framed concrete warehouses and two iron-roofed flat warehouses are required. The steel-framed warehouses can be increased to four stories at any time, and the iron-roofed flat warehouses can be demolished, and the site can be used to build steel-framed warehouses, as well as offices, staff dormitories, etc. The construction cost is about 5 million yuan. The location is in the south section of the wharf area, accounting for about one-third of the area. It has been contracted and is expected to be completed by the end of October this year, and can be put into operation. If necessary, the second phase of the project is planned to be continued.</p>
<p>When the entire plan is completed, there will be a straight shoreline of about 3,000 feet, eight four-story steel-framed warehouses, and iron-roofed warehouses. At the south end, there is a separate horse-drawn boat port. Although there are about 1,000 feet of warehouses behind, the Shanghai municipal road Xu Daopuxi Road runs north and south from the city center to the middle and far green of the wharf, and Wuquan Road runs horizontally in between. In the northern part of the wharf area, there is a public wharf of about 350 feet long. All the wharf decks in front of each warehouse are equipped with mechanical equipment for transporting goods, such as cranes and railway tracks. In the wharf area, along both sides of Puxi Road, there is space reserved for the construction of travel agencies, shipping companies, transportation companies, automobile companies, hotels, and other agencies related to the wharf.</p>
<p>Shanghai is not only the largest commercial port in the Far East, but also one of the top ten commercial ports in the world. Its supply of goods is larger than any other commercial port in Asia. By water, it controls the throat of the Yangtze River. By land, the railway runs across it and can be connected with major domestic trunk lines. All imported goods must be distributed from Shanghai to the Yangtze River basin, such as Nanjing, Pukou, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, and then to Hankou, and then from the Yangtze River basin, they are transported to the interior. The goods from the interior and the various ports of the Yangtze River must also be concentrated in Shanghai for transportation and export. Therefore, Shanghai is the general hub for the distribution of import and export goods from the provinces along the Yangtze River. The Qiujiang Wharf plans to lay railway tracks in front and behind the warehouses to connect to the Songhu Line, so that it can be jointly transported with the various lines that have opened to traffic in Shanghai, such as the Beijing-Zhejiang, Pingjin, and Yuehan lines. All goods arriving in Shanghai from overseas can be unloaded and transported to the interior by train as soon as the ship arrives, and the export goods from the interior can also be loaded from the train to the Qiujiang Wharf and unloaded onto the ship for direct transport overseas. Regardless of import or export goods, there is no need to fall into the warehouse, which saves time and reduces costs. There are three railway tracks behind the warehouses and one in front of the wharf, which merge into one at the intersection of Wuquan Road and connect to the Songhu Line along the Huangpu River in the northern part of the city center, about 9 kilometers long. According to the estimate of the Lianglu Administration, the construction cost is about 750,000 yuan in national currency. How to raise and bear the construction cost, how to design the various projects, is now being discussed and handled with the bureau. After it is built in the future, it can achieve the effect of water-land combined transportation. There are also thousands of acres of vacant land near the wharf. In the Greater Shanghai plan, it is planned to be used as an airport, and at the same time, a place is designated on the river surface for seaplanes to berth. If these two become a reality in the future, the transportation of goods at the wharf will not only be connected by water and land, but will also be connected by water, land, and air. This is the unique feature of Qiujiang Wharf, which is not only unmatched by other wharves in the Far East, but will also become one of the best wharves in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Perspective View of Qiujiang Wharf <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the water supply equipment for ships, the fire protection work of the wharf and warehouses, and the public security and cleaning issues, the existing equipment of the various wharves in this port is not perfect, especially the convenience for travelers and those who pick them up has not been paid attention to. Qiujiang Wharf is different, with careful consideration and perfect equipment everywhere. The paths for passengers to travel back and forth are separated from the path for transporting goods, and the two do not interfere with each other. There is a reception room for passengers and those who pick them up to rest. There is also a store that sells food and drinks, as well as famous Chinese products, for passengers to purchase. In addition, there are lookout stations, customs baggage and passport inspection offices, parking spaces, police stations, and information desks. In short, passengers are given every convenience to stay or travel back and forth.</p>
<p>(3) Contents of the First Phase of the Project</p>
<p>Appropriately along the Huangpu River to the north of the Qiujiang estuary, about 1,500 feet long, a large straight-line wharf is built here. Because a barge port of 220 feet long is temporarily set up in the middle section, the shoreline is recessed inward, so the wharf is formed into two seats. Along the barge port, that is, in the middle of the two wharves, there is a two-story office building. The upper floor is the wharf office, and the lower floor is the customs inspection office and passenger reception room. On both sides of the office building, north and south, there are two two-story steel-framed warehouses. In addition, at the north and south ends, there are two warehouses that are almost identical. The back part to the west is a flat cargo stacking field, surrounded by roads. The residential dormitories are located in the southwest corner of the entire area. The various projects designed are described in detail below:</p>
<p>(A) Wharf</p>
<p>The wharf is divided into two seats, each with a length of 590 feet. The lower part is filled with wooden bridges, and the upper part is made of steel-framed concrete. The wooden bridge is driven below the average water level to prevent it from rotting easily. The wharf deck is 50 feet wide and has all the mooring equipment. Below, there are mooring gears spaced 50 feet apart, and there are crossbeams for mooring barges. There are rotary cranes on the deck, and a low-level deck is built below so that small boats and barges can still work normally when the tide is low.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Member of the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee Chen Xing <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>(B) Warehouse</p>
<p>(1) Steel-framed Warehouse</p>
<p>The two steel-framed warehouses are fixed buildings. The lower part is built with 100-foot and 90-foot long wooden floors, and the upper part is made of steel-framed concrete. The foundation is prepared for four-story buildings. However, only two stories are built at present, and the remaining two stories are planned to be added when the business expands in the future. In this way, not only is the opening cost saved, but also when the building is raised, the foundation will not be re-driven, which will hinder the use of the original two-story warehouse. Each warehouse is 220 feet long and 130 feet wide. The upper floor is for long-term storage of goods, while the lower floor is for short-term storage of goods.</p>
<p>(2) Iron-roofed Flat Warehouse</p>
<p>The two iron-roofed flat warehouses are temporary buildings for short-term storage of goods. Each is 220 feet long and 80 feet wide, with three bridges leading directly to the wharf deck. If a fixed steel-framed warehouse is built, the iron-roofed flat warehouse can be demolished and moved to the rear for use, and the site will be used to build the steel-framed warehouse. Because the scope of business is not yet known, it is chosen for its low price and easy movement. There is no great loss in demolishing and reinstalling it. If a mail ship over 5-600 feet long is berthed at the wharf, the rotary crane on the wharf deck can lift the cargo from the ship's fore cabin to the front of the iron-roofed shed; the cargo from the aft cabin can be lifted to any receiving platform of the steel-framed warehouse, and then the goods can be stored separately according to their long-term and short-term storage properties. Not only is the procedure quick, but it also saves transportation costs.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Member of the Qujiang Wharf Construction Committee, Xu Kan <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>(3) Warehouse capacity and internal/external cargo handling equipment.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Member of the Qujiang Wharf Construction Committee, Ye Zhuotang <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The total existing warehouse capacity is approximately 15,000 tons. Outside the warehouse, on the dock deck, there are rail-mounted cranes, which can directly lift goods from the ship's hold to any floor of the steel-framed warehouse without the need for manual handling. In front of the warehouse, at the cargo inspection area, there is a duplex straight-line crane that can directly lift goods from the lower level of the warehouse to the upper level. All cranes include four crane trucks, two inclined rollers, and one 1-ton and one 6-ton mobile elevator vehicle each, and one hundred and fifty cargo-rolling pulleys. If necessary, several 1-ton and 10.5-ton semi-rotary cranes will be added. The rear part of the warehouse is equipped with an elevator. Therefore, a one-way traffic pattern can be maintained inside the warehouse.</p>
<p>(C) Office.</p>
<p>The office is located in the middle of the warehouse, two stories high, 220 feet long, and built of reinforced concrete bricks and tiles. The upper floor is the wharf office, and the lower floor is arranged as a customs inspection office and passenger reception room in accordance with the new customs regulations. It is built in the center of the wharf along the bank, making it the administrative center of the wharf's traffic management, which seems more convenient for business.</p>
<p>(D) Staff Residences.</p>
<p>The staff residences are built at the southwest end of the wharf area, equidistant and not far from the wharf warehouses. The project includes one residence for the wharf manager, two residences for the wharf supervisors, two residences for the customs inspectors, one dormitory for staff that can accommodate forty people, and six two-bay two-story houses, and twelve one-bay two-story houses.</p>
<p>(E) Cargo Storage Yards and Roads.</p>
<p>Behind the warehouses, etc., is a cargo storage yard with an area of approximately 257,400 square feet, divided into nine rectangular areas. Each area is surrounded by roads, temporarily for the accumulation of heavy goods that are not affected by the weather. In the future, it will be used as the base for building warehouses. The roads are paved with a solid coal layer.</p>
<p>(F) Traffic Routes.</p>
<p>In the public road system of the urban area, two major trunk lines are designated. One is a north-south line, which is Puxi Road, starting from Yangshupu, along the west bank of the Huangpu River, passing about 1,000 feet behind the wharf, that is, parallel to the north and south in the middle of the wharf line and Jungong Road, to Wusong. One is an east-west line, which is Puxi Road, starting from Yangshupu, along the west bank of the Huangpu River, passing about 1,000 feet behind the wharf, that is, parallel to the north in the middle of the wharf line and Jungong Road, to Wusong. One is an east-west line, which is Wuquan Road, starting from the north end bank of the first phase of the wharf use area, crossing Jungong Road and reaching the center of the urban area. Other roads parallel to Wuquan Road in the east-west direction include Xiangyin Road, Hairong Road, and Haitang Road. Except for the section of Wuquan Road from the city center area to Jungong Road, which has been built long ago, and the current construction of Jungong Road to the wharf area; the rest have not yet been built. However, the section of Puxi Road in the wharf area will be built simultaneously with the completion of the first phase of the wharf project. The road surfaces of each route are planned to be paved with asphalt and are wide in area. Among them, Wuquan Road and Puxi Road are particularly so.</p>

<p>The area from the rear of the wharf to Puxi Road, in the first phase of the project, has already been provided with a cinder road network, that is, the roads around the cargo storage yard mentioned above, one of which is larger and directly connects to the north gate, and is connected to Wuquan Road. Therefore, Wuquan Road is the main road for land transportation at the wharf. The completion of this road can coincide with the completion of the first phase of the wharf project.</p>
<p>When the wharf starts operating, there will be three traffic routes in the wharf area: (1) From Wuquan Road, turn into Jungong Road to reach Yangshupu Road; (2) From Wuquan Road, pass through the city center area and turn into Qimei Road to reach Dihisiwei Road; (3) From Wuquan Road, pass through the city center area and turn into Jiangwan Road to reach North Sichuan Road. The driving time on these three routes is less than twenty minutes, which can be said to be extremely convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Member of the Qujiang Wharf Construction Committee, Liu Hongsheng <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The above is a general outline of the plan to build the wharf. The entire project can be completed in the autumn. The only feature of the wharf is that it is planned to lay railway tracks to connect to the Songhu Line, and that vacant land near the wharf can be used to build an airport. If these things become reality in the future, then combined water, land, and air transportation will be available. Passenger transportation, cargo, and mail transportation will save time and expenses, international trade will be promoted as a result, and both national economy and people's livelihood will benefit. In that case, the Qujiang Wharf will not only be able to take the lead among the docks in the east, but will also be able to compete with the world's major docks without being inferior. This is what we can expect.</p>
<p>What's more, all shipping facilities upstream and downstream of the Huangpu River are deeply related to the development of our country's industry and commerce. They must be managed independently by the Chinese people in a thorough manner, so that they can be improved day by day and strive for development; the construction of Qujiang Wharf is indeed its beginning.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Position of Qujiang Wharf in China's International Trade <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Chengwen</p>
<p>The wharf industry is closely related to international trade. With excellent wharf facilities, cargo handling is convenient, which not only saves time but also reduces costs. As a result, large-scale trade is attracted. Now, all commercially developed countries in the world are building complete wharves in their commercial ports to facilitate the loading and unloading of import and export goods.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's trade center. More than 50% of the country's import and export trade is concentrated in Shanghai, and about 40% of the domestic entrepot trade is also monopolized by Shanghai. From this, it can be seen that Shanghai is the largest port for domestic and foreign trade in China. As trade is prosperous, the wharf industry is also quite developed. According to the Shanghai Port Guide (1934), the total length of the beaches on both sides of the Huangpu River in Pudong and Puxi is 253.475 English feet, of which 38.770 English feet are used as ordinary cargo wharves, 27.440 English feet are used as special cargo wharves, 13.025 English feet are used as shipyards, 19.255 English feet are used as roads and public or customs wharves, 27.480 English feet are used as industrial beaches, and 5.535 English feet are used as creeks. The remaining 121.970 English feet are undeveloped beaches. There are more than 100 major wharves and shipyards in total. Although Shanghai's wharves are more developed than other ports in China, their nature is not yet sound and their equipment is not complete. It is inevitable that they will be stretched to cope with current needs, let alone promote the development of future trade. In terms of nature, the biggest shortcomings of Shanghai's current wharves are that there are too few wharves operated by the Chinese, and the wharf industry is almost entirely in the hands of foreigners. According to a survey of the wharves on both sides of the Huangpu River in Pudong and Puxi (including shipyards), there are about 92 in total, of which 15 belong to the Chinese government, and 19 belong to private Chinese merchants, totaling 34, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of wharves in Shanghai. The remaining two-thirds are owned by the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and France. Moreover, the wharves operated by China, except for those operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the San Bei Company, are mostly small wharves with simple equipment, or are only used for loading and unloading coal. Their scale is not as powerful as those operated by foreigners. As a result, the loading and unloading of goods is inevitably controlled by foreigners. Secondly, there are too few public wharves, and most of them are private. Among the 92 wharves in Shanghai, only 15 are operated by the Chinese government (including the wharves operated by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the railway wharves, and the municipal government wharves), and only 2 belong to the Public Concession's Public Works Department, totaling 17, accounting for only 18% of the total number of wharves. From this, it can be seen that most of Shanghai's wharves are privately owned. The excessive number of such private wharves not only makes it difficult to achieve uniform loading and unloading fees and procedures, but also often results in high costs, which directly affect the transportation costs of goods and indirectly affect the development of trade.</p>
<p>Attached: Classification of Nationality of Important Wharves on the East and West Banks of the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of equipment, Shanghai's wharves have not been able to fully facilitate the loading and unloading of goods. Shanghai's existing wharves cannot accommodate the berthing of first-class ocean-going ships. According to the Shanghai Port Guide, the length of Shanghai's wharves that can accommodate ships with a draft of 28 feet is about 10,000 English feet, and the length of those that can accommodate ships with a draft of 30 feet is only 6,000 English feet. However, the commerce of the Pacific Ocean will inevitably be carried by ships with deeper drafts in the future. The draft of large ships should reach 33 feet. It is clear that Shanghai's wharves are insufficient to meet the needs of large ships for berthing and unloading. As for the various equipment on the wharves, they are even more simple. The most important equipment for a wharf is cranes, light railways, barges, and warehouses. Among Shanghai's wharves, there are hardly any that are equipped with light railways, and the mechanical equipment such as cranes is also very lacking. Other equipment such as barges and warehouses is also not perfect. In short, if we want to develop Shanghai and China's foreign trade, it is necessary to improve the wharves. This is undeniable.</p>
<p>The Qujiang Wharf, which started construction last May, is a unique color in the history of China's commercial ports. The wharf will be completed this year. Its nature, equipment, management, and location are all very perfect. It deserves to be the largest wharf in China. In the future, it will have great benefits for the prosperity of Shanghai and the development of China's international trade. From the perspective of foreign trade, the characteristics of Qujiang Wharf are approximately six points:</p>
<p>1.  Qujiang Wharf is the largest state-owned wharf in China. Qujiang Wharf is operated by the Central Bank, so Qujiang Wharf is not only a wharf operated by China, but also a state-owned wharf in China. Since the wharf is state-owned, its purpose is purely to promote the prosperity of commercial ports and trade, and not to seek profit for itself. Therefore, not only will its fees be lower than other wharves, but it will also be able to provide various new-style wharf equipment to facilitate the loading and unloading of commercial goods. What private wharves cannot do, Qujiang Wharf can advocate and do.</p>
<p>2.  Qujiang Wharf is Shanghai's largest wharf with a wide surface and deep water. Due to waterway conditions, most of Shanghai's wharves must wait for the tide for large ships to enter and exit. Qujiang Wharf is located at the mouth of the Qujiang River, with a straight shoreline, the widest surface, and the deepest water. Any large ship can enter and exit without waiting for the tide, and can avoid various dangers and berth safely. Time and expenses can be saved, and efficiency can be improved.</p>
<p>3.  Qujiang Wharf is the wharf with the best location. Qujiang Wharf is located at the mouth of the Qujiang River in Yinhang District, Shanghai, facing the Huangpu River and connecting to the city center in the west, close to the industrial and commercial area in Shanghai's plan. In the future, as the city center becomes more and more developed and the Greater Shanghai Plan is gradually completed, the wharf will undoubtedly become the outlet of the city center. The main principle of wharf construction is that its location must not only meet current needs, but also adapt to future development. Qujiang Wharf has both. Therefore, when the engineering experts of the League of Nations inspected Shanghai's commercial port in 1932, they also believed that the mouth of the Qujiang River was close to the new urban area and was an ideal location for building mail ships and other commercial vessel wharves.</p>
<p>4.  Qujiang Wharf is the wharf with the most complete equipment in China. Qujiang Wharf currently has two steel-framed concrete wharves, each 590 meters long, which can berth the largest giant ships in the world coming to Shanghai. Between the two wharves, there is a barge port, where barges of all sizes are berthed. On the wharf, there are two warehouses and two iron-shed flat warehouses, which can accommodate a total of 15,000 tons of goods. In the two warehouses, various offices and rest rooms are built. Qujiang Wharf is the first in Shanghai to have offices in the wharf. Outside the warehouse, there are several extra-large cranes installed. Heavy goods in the ship can be lifted by the crane to any floor of the warehouse, and goods in the warehouse can also be lifted to the cargo ship, without the need for workers to carry them, and the loading and unloading is very fast. This type of crane is an innovation in this port. In addition, light railways are laid in front and behind the warehouse to directly transport goods to cargo trucks, and then transfer them to various inland areas. This equipment is also unprecedented in Shanghai.</p>
<p>5.  Qujiang Wharf has many transportation routes and convenient transportation. Whether a wharf can prosper largely depends on whether the hinterland is rich and deep. The size of the hinterland behind the wharf always depends on the number of transportation routes connecting the hinterland to the wharf. The more transportation routes, the faster the transportation and the lower the cost. Qujiang Wharf is located in front of the city center, not only is it most closely connected to the city center, but also the transportation to the special zone is extremely convenient. It takes less than ten minutes from the special zone to the wharf. In addition, the wharf also plans to lay three railway lines behind the warehouse to connect to the Songhu Road, and can implement intermodal transportation with the Beijing-Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Pingjin, and Longhai lines. Goods can be intermodally transported to various places without the need for warehouses. In terms of water transportation, the wharf can also directly unload and load ships sailing to various ports on the river and sea. Whether it is waterway or land route, it is very convenient, and it can greatly save time and expenses. In the future, the wharf will become one of the most convenient wharves for loading and unloading goods in China, which can be expected.</p>
<p>6.  Qujiang Wharf is the wharf that can best adapt to future development. Now is the era of world economy, and business development is advancing rapidly. Shanghai is a commercial center in the Pacific Ocean, and its future development is unlimited. Therefore, wharf equipment should also be prepared to expand at any time to meet future needs, so as to maintain permanent prosperity. The area of Qujiang Wharf is more than 1,100 mu, and the land currently used is only one-third. There is a lot of remaining land, and there is no problem for future development. In terms of wharf construction, the current two wharves total 1,180 meters, which can berth two giant ships of more than 500 meters. The second planned step in the future is to extend the wharf to 3,000 meters, and at the same time can accommodate six giant ships of more than 500 meters in the world. There are currently two warehouses, and it is planned to build eight in the future. It is also planned to build three iron-shed flat warehouses. In addition, it is also planned to build travel agencies, shipping companies, transportation companies, and hotels, etc., in order to fully provide merchants with various conveniences.</p>
<p>The six characteristics of Qujiang Wharf listed above are closely related to the prosperity of China's international trade. In the future, when the wharf is completed, China's commercial transportation will become more and more convenient. It is expected that Shanghai and China's foreign trade will receive a new boost due to the completion of Qujiang Wharf. This is what we can assert when the foundation laying ceremony of Qujiang Wharf is held.</p>

<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Youth is unavoidable. Is it in lust? Unmarried men and women often masturbate. Married couples indulge in excessive sexual activity. Gradually, the essence becomes loose, and sexual function weakens, leading to spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms. This has become a common ailment among young people.</p>
<p>The treatment for spermatorrhea should prioritize consolidating the essence. "Hemet's Essence-Consolidating Pills" are the main remedy. If spermatorrhea has been prolonged and the essence is depleted, supplementing the essence is secondary. "Germinal Essence" is the main remedy.</p>
<p>The treatment for premature ejaculation should prioritize nourishing the sexual nerves. "Germinal Essence" is the main remedy. For faster treatment, "Yuvit Syrup" can be injected simultaneously.</p>
<p>Both conditions can be effectively treated with combined therapy.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Women's Hidden Ailment: Leukorrhea <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Inflammation of the female genitalia often secretes a purulent discharge, which is what is known as leukorrhea. Because this discharge is particularly acidic, sperm are destroyed upon contact ★ Therefore, leukorrhea is often one of the main causes of infertility in women who have been married for a long time.</p>
<p>The treatment for this condition should be both internal and external, so that it can be effective extremely quickly. After healing, a son can be obtained with one try, which can be expected.</p>
<p>The patient, Mrs. Li, is 38 years old. She has been married for 16 years, but has not given birth due to frequent menstrual irregularities and persistent leukorrhea. Her beauty has been lost, and she is thin and frail. Her symptoms of weakness are endless. She is afraid of movement and dislikes labor, and suffers from backaches and back pain. She looks like she is 45 or 46 years old. Last autumn, Mr. Li urgently sought a concubine for the sake of offspring. Mrs. Li then asked her close relative, Mrs. Ni, to introduce her to me for treatment. (Mrs. Ni had previously suffered from a similar ailment and was cured by me.) After I instructed her to purchase "Female Germinal Essence" from the Taihe Pharmacy and to use "Leukorrhea Remover" externally to treat herself at home according to the instructions, she returned for a second consultation. The leukorrhea gradually cleared up within a month. After the leukorrhea cleared up, her menstruation also became regular. She regained her youth. Her muscles became plump and her breasts became firm. Just last month, Mrs. Li introduced her friend to quit smoking. I saw that her abdomen was bulging. When I asked about her current condition, I learned that Mrs. Li had been pregnant for four or five months.</p>

<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The patient, Xia Guojun, came to consult last winter, complaining of bone joint soreness and numbness in his hands and feet. He had been treated repeatedly, but without much effect. I immediately asked to see his old prescriptions, which all focused solely on removing rheumatism. However, my diagnosis of Mr. Xia's condition was that it was still caused by residual toxins that had not been cleared. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Pills" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy. After taking them, he felt comfortable in his bone joints and meridians, and his hands and feet also felt flexible. His condition was completely cured.</p>
<h3 id="e225">The Pain of Gonorrhea <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Venereal diseases make people turn pale at the mention of them. Syphilis and gonorrhea have unknowingly destroyed so much health and eradicated offspring and fertility. Since the appearance of "606" and "Anti-Gonorrhea," countless patients have been saved. They are truly the formidable enemies of venereal diseases and the saviors of patients.</p>
<p>The pathogen of gonorrhea is a type of gonococcus. The virus invades and causes hundreds of dangerous symptoms. The reproductive glands are poisoned by it, destroying offspring and fertility, impairing health, and shortening life. How lamentable!</p>
<p>"Anti-Gonorrhea" is an internal medicine made of yellow pigment. Its medicinal properties are upright and have no drawbacks. It is suitable for the Chinese physique. It is used to treat acute, chronic, mild, severe, stubborn, and fixed gonorrhea. It has the effect of curing the disease upon taking the medicine. This is because "Anti-Gonorrhea" has great membrane penetrating power, strong bactericidal power, eliminates inflammation and swelling, and completely cures the disease. It is not comparable to ordinary cheap and inferior medicines. Recently, I have used it to completely cure new and old gonorrhea in Mr. Shao, Mr. Zhang, and others. All of them achieved remarkable results after taking only four or five boxes.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Weak Stomach - Food Stagnation <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Yang Jianqing, has a weak stomach by nature and dislikes food when he sees it. His digestion is also poor. He often suffers from food stagnation and stomach sluggishness. He has taken various stomach medicines repeatedly, but they only have a temporary effect and cannot achieve complete success. He then regarded it as an incurable chronic disease and delayed treatment. This spring, after hearing that his close relative, Mr. Shen, had been cured of gastrointestinal diseases by me using "Stomach Pain Reliever," he also came to me for treatment. After I told him that his condition was different from Mr. Shen's, who suffered from gastritis and stomach pain, I prescribed "Stomach Pain Reliever" as the main remedy. Mr. Yang's condition was entirely caused by a weak stomach. I prescribed "Stomach Strengthener" and instructed him to purchase it from the Taihe Pharmacy. After taking it for three consecutive days, the accumulated food was completely digested. After taking it for several days, his appetite was strong. After finishing three boxes, he felt that his stomach was strong and that he could digest even stone eggs.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Safe Smoking Cessation, Early Removal of Addiction and Poison <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is not difficult. What is difficult is that the patient does not suffer from illness and enjoys mental well-being during the abstinence period. However, if you want to achieve this expectation, you must first seek a tonic that can treat all kinds of illnesses. Our clinical experience is that Stanana's "Germinal Essence" is the most effective. "Germinal Essence" can remove the toxic effects of smoking and quickly break the smoking addiction, quickly restoring strength. It is indeed the holy medicine that ordinary smokers desire in their ideals.</p>
<p>The quitter, Mr. Li, was physically weak and unable to support himself. Medication was ineffective, so he smoked to cheer himself up. He smoked for many years and quit several times, but all failed due to illness and suffering. Now, due to strict prohibitions, he was concerned about the future, so he came to me for treatment. I immediately instructed him to take "Germinal Essence" during the smoking cessation period. All his symptoms of weakness were treated. There was no pain during the cessation period. Because Mr. Li wanted to achieve quick results, I also injected him with "Yuvit Syrup." Therefore, his smoking addiction was broken earlier than expected, which surprised Mr. Li.</p>

<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>If rheumatism and bone pain are delayed and untreated, the blood will become impure, there will be excessive uric acid, and sour poison will invade, causing muscle soreness, meridian cramps, limb numbness, and hemiplegia. It is not enough to cure it radically without using the right medicine. Last month, I used it to cure Mr. and Mrs. Weng's bone pain and limb numbness. The medicine used did not even amount to half a dozen. I also prescribed "Germinal Essence" for men and women respectively to restore their strength, as if they had regained their freedom. They thanked me repeatedly and left.</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Harm of Masturbation <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianzeng</p>
<p>Young people are vigorous and should avoid lust. However, there is a clear divide between men and women. Unable to achieve desires, they think about it day and night and express it in their dreams. Seeking pleasure from prostitutes, they are terrified of syphilis and gonorrhea. Unable to find a way to release, they masturbate privately. It has become an open secret. When we examine patients clinically, we find that there is hardly anyone who wants to maintain their purity. They secretly indulge, relying on their strength. Parents and elder brothers do not see or hear it, and there is no way to warn them. So many good young people are poisoned and sacrificed by it. Alas! This is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>The harm of masturbation is equivalent to bloodletting, even worse than starvation. This is because semen is condensed from red blood, and the brain marrow thrives on it. The nutrition of the whole body relies on semen. Those who masturbate have thin and dry semen, their spirits decline day by day, their bodies weaken day by day, their muscles waste away, and their qi and blood are depleted. Not only is there no way to have good development, but also spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission occur, and various diseases arise. If they do not waste themselves through masturbation, they will be harmed by spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission. If masturbation is not stopped and spermatorrhea is not treated, you will see that life is lost, fertility is hopeless, there is no share in health, and life is cut short. How regrettable!</p>
<p>Some say that the harm of spermatorrhea and masturbation is worse than floods and fierce beasts. Their words are credible. Floods and fierce beasts are tangible and can be prevented. Spermatorrhea and masturbation are intangible and difficult to stop. Weakening the race and harming the body, the disaster is fierce and cruel. This is what enlightened people should loudly call out from above, and parents, elder brothers, and good friends should earnestly advise from the side, in the hope that those who are drowning will suddenly wake up and those who have not will avoid it. This is not only the good fortune of society, but also the way to preserve excellent young people for the future of the country.</p>
<p>The patient, Li Yunzhong, 33 years old, first masturbated, which led to spermatorrhea. Then he married early, which led to premature ejaculation. His life force was extinguished, and his happiness was lost. His spirits were weak and his body was frail. He suffered from hundreds of symptoms, including insomnia, forgetfulness, dizziness, tinnitus, back pain, palpitations, and night sweats. He was in unbearable pain. (Omitted) Last winter, he came to me for treatment. I told him that the source of his illness was the damage to his reproductive glands, which could not be effectively treated by ordinary tonics and preparations. I instructed him to purchase "Germinal Essence" and "Hemet's Essence-Consolidating Pills" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take them together. Consolidating the essence and treating the weakness, treating both the symptoms and the root cause, within about a month, spermatorrhea was eradicated, and premature ejaculation disappeared. All his symptoms were gone, and he regained his strength. He thanked me repeatedly and left.</p>

<p>Kidney Deficiency, Weak Constitution, Sexual Dysfunction</p>
<p>Patient Dai Yongling, 42 years old, from Changzhou, works at the Wheel Bureau. (Chief Complaint) — Kidney deficiency, weak constitution. (Medical History) — Mr. Dai has worked at the bureau for many years and has two families, making the financial burden quite heavy. After the January 28th Incident, Mr. Dai's income sharply decreased, causing him anxiety. As a result, his body gradually became thin and weak. He had taken tonics before, but they were never effective. Starting last autumn, he suddenly suffered from lower back pain. He felt uneasy during the day and suffered from insomnia and excessive dreams at night. He even suffered from nocturnal emissions, and his nerves became increasingly weak. He sought treatment from me this spring. (Current Symptoms) — Neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation. (Treatment) — I administered sinusoidal wave therapy and instructed him to purchase "Germinal Extract" and "Hemitol's Semen-Conserving Tablets" from Wing On Company and take them according to instructions. He returned for a follow-up visit ten days later and had already shown significant improvement. He said that the nocturnal emission had ceased and he could sleep peacefully at night. He was examined a total of three times. Now he is full of energy and all his symptoms have disappeared. His lower back is strong, and he is not afraid of fatigue.</p>
<p>Kidney Deficiency, Nocturnal Emission, Brain Weakness, Insomnia</p>
<p>Patient Liang Ziquan, 33 years old, from Zhenhai, in the business world. (Chief Complaint) — Kidney atrophy, nocturnal emission, brain weakness, insomnia. (Medical History) — Mr. Liang was handsome and talented in his youth. Seven or eight years ago, he became a compradore for a foreign firm and had a substantial income. He had many friends and girlfriends. He was an excellent dancer and became inextricably linked with a certain dance star, indulging day and night, leading to severe depletion. As a result, his body gradually weakened. He felt even more exhausted when interacting with his girlfriends. He suffered from kidney atrophy, nocturnal emission, and other symptoms. He consulted numerous doctors and took medicine, but it was ineffective. Later, he was introduced to me by his close friend Mr. Ji for treatment. (Current Symptoms) — Reproductive gland weakness. (Treatment) — In addition to administering the latest electrotherapy, I also instructed him to purchase "Hemitol's Semen-Conserving Tablets" from China-England Dispensary to treat his nocturnal emission and "Germinal Extract" to treat his kidney atrophy and weakness. After taking five boxes, all his ailments disappeared. He became strong and healthy, and he repeatedly thanked me before leaving.</p>

<p>Famous Drugs Save Lymphatic Turbidity and Bone Pain</p>
<p>Lymphatic turbidity is best treated symptomatically when it first starts. If you mistakenly take cheap, inferior medicine, the poison will be absorbed internally, and it will seem like it is cured, but it is not. A hundred dangerous symptoms will appear, causing endless harm. If the poison enters the bone, it will cause joint soreness, muscle aches, and other symptoms. Medication should be taken on all sides. For example, at the end of spring, I treated Mr. Xu and Mr. Fan's lymphatic turbidity and bone pain. I instructed them to purchase the yellow pigment preparation "Anti-Gonorrhea Lymph" Antirrhea from Wing On Company to kill bacteria and treat their lymphatic turbidity, and to take "Johnstone's Bone Pain Tablets" to detoxify and treat their bone pain. After taking four or five boxes in a row, the ailments were completely cured. They quickly regained their health and became as strong as tigers.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking is Safe and Pleasant</p>
<p>Insecurity from quitting smoking leads to repeated illnesses. Nocturnal emission and insomnia are the most common. The treatment method is not only to consolidate sperm but also to supplement it. The method of quitting is not only to remove toxins but also to replenish deficiency. The tonic power of "Germinal Extract" has been praised by doctors and proven by patients. Its effectiveness in removing toxins and breaking addiction is undoubtedly above all kinds of tonics. It is generally recognized by the public as the only supreme remedy for safe smoking cessation. I used it last month to quit Mr. Jiang's long-term smoking addiction. At the beginning of spring, I used the above-mentioned drugs to quit Mr. Qian's and Mr. Qiu's smoking addiction with nocturnal emission, and both achieved the most satisfactory results. In order to achieve rapid results, Mr. Qian also injected "Yuwei Cibaoming" Suve-Spermin at the same time, so the quitting period was shortened, totaling less than four weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Beware of Traps <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Danxing</p>
<p>Every dark corner of this society is filled with traps. Young women whose youthful fires are burning brightly and experiencing sexual impulses are no different from standing at the mouth of a bottomless trap. This is the most dangerous period of a woman's life, and it determines whether her entire future will be fortunate or unfortunate. It is like sailing a boat on a stormy sea. If you can have your own opinions, have perseverance, and hold the rudder steady, you can avoid danger and create a bright and happy future. If you are confused by a kind of wonderful temptation, unable to restrain the burning boredom of youth, "one wrong step brings everlasting regret." Precious youth and chastity will inevitably be swallowed up by beasts in human skin.</p>
<p>In every situation in this society, there are many such people in human skin with beastly hearts who feed on the youth and chastity of women. They have handsome appearances, speak sweet words, and have agile wrists. They set up traps and nets, waiting for young women who are just maturing, have weak wills, and have little life experience to fall into them. Don't we see lawsuits involving the loss of chastity in the social news in newspapers every day! There are many young women whose minds and bodies have been defiled because they have been deceived by others, but they dare not publicly announce it and file a lawsuit because it concerns their face and reputation. They still live in secret pain, destroying the courage to move forward. There are even more who are unknown. Whether they are intellectual, semi-civilized, or completely uneducated women, they must be vigilant. If they are driven by temporary feelings and resolutely embark on the road of "love," and the crime is committed and the tragic result begins, it is "too late to regret."</p>
<p>Socializing and love are not products of sin, if they can be obtained in a legitimate way without blindly following others. However, how many men and women in this society truly understand the true value and true meaning of socializing and love? Many women are groping on rugged roads with their eyes covered by vanity. Many women, at the peak of their burning youthful fires, have their entire nerves completely occupied by impulsive feelings. Therefore, they blindly hope to find an object in the form of "socializing." At this time, it is the best opportunity for a group of playboy men to set traps. Young women, beware of traps!</p>
<h3 id="e233">Do Women Need to Return to the Home? <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Zhen</p>
<p>Ever since Xi Shiqin proposed the slogan of women returning to the home, a group of male chauvinists in male society immediately seemed to have obtained a kind of guarantee for their opinions. They loudly raised many unreasonable arguments against the women's movement, women's participation in politics, and women's activities in the workplace. They wanted to take advantage of this trend to drive the women who had just begun to show their faces in society back to the home and suppress the women who were preparing to raise their sails to society in the dark corners of the home, in order to protect their male-centered social bulwark.</p>
<p>Originally, in China, the social status of women was already pitiful enough. Although the women's movement, following the upsurge of the May Fourth Movement, had once obtained the government's recognition of the equality of women's social status in politics, economics, education, and all other areas, it only raised the status of a very, very small number of privileged women, as a superficial perfunctory measure. In reality, the vast majority of women are still suffocated in the kitchen, and have never seen a glimmer of light. Now, the big men and gentlemen of China are actually learning the fashion and calling for women to return to the home. In fact, they have not seen that Chinese women do not need to be so worried.</p>
<p>Now, standing on the position of human beings, let us calmly discuss whether women, in addition to housework, cannot participate in other career activities? Of course, the family is the foundation of society, and we cannot abandon the family because of social work. However, this responsibility is not for women alone but for both men and women. If men, under the guise of working in society, completely unload the responsibility of the family and simply send a little money home every month, then for the so-called wife, it is completely like hiring an employee. Then why can't the woman go to society to earn money to hire a man or other women who do this as a profession to maintain her family for her? Therefore, this situation can never make women succumb.</p>
<p>In general, people always think that women's nature is suitable for managing the home, so women should be in the home. This is also not a reason at all. If women were not restrained by thousands of years of ritual education and the pure family environment, and had been cultivated to be so weak and incompetent from childhood, it is not certain that they would not be strong, brave, and very capable. We can understand this clearly by comparing the labor situation of women in border areas where the culture is relatively backward and the power of ritual education is relatively weak. Moreover, in fact, among the general women today, there are many women who are strong and capable enough to assume social work and the great responsibilities of mankind. On the contrary, among men, there are many who are incompetent and only know how to spend money on drinking and entertainment, without engaging in production.</p>
<p>Moreover, we Chinese have always suppressed women in the home. No matter how much a job needs people, they are always unwilling to realize that capable women can help, and would rather have a general incompetent man to muddle through, resulting in the social undertaking as a whole declining day by day. Also, because there are few producers and many consumers, every family feels economic panic, forming a weak economic force for the entire society. Therefore, Chinese women, in theory, especially need to come out to work in society.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my personal opinion, if a woman's ability and ambition are sufficient to achieve a career, then of course she should contribute her ability to society and compete with society. If a woman's strength is sufficient to manage the home and there is still extra strength, then in addition to managing the home, she should also use her spare strength to serve society. Furthermore, if a woman's temperament is indeed gentle and indecisive, and she is not interested in social undertakings, then she might as well settle down in the home. The so-called slogan of women returning to the home is fundamentally unreasonable and not applicable to China.</p>
<p>Now, for the capable and knowledgeable women who are living at home, I hope that you will come to society. Indeed, modern China needs the strength of the entire nation!</p>
<h3 id="e234">So-Called Wonderful Beauty Methods <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Da Qian</p>
<p>Women's love of beauty is in their nature and is also a virtue. In the past, the methods of embellishment were not sophisticated. When beauty faded or was not endowed at birth, one could only lament at the mirror. In modern times, all kinds of surgeries are available, so there are so-called wonderful beauty methods. Paris has a doctor named Fassot, who is the world's most famous expert in facial modification. Since his death (he recently passed away), the beauty methods he used have become the wonderful techniques of "facial doctors" everywhere. In recent years, "beauty salons" have appeared in the United States, taking advantage of the trend of the times and catering to the preferences of women. Can such organizations avoid not spreading to our country without being asked? What is the matter in the end? It is not enough to draw a conclusion without knowing its contents. This is the reason why this article was written.</p>
<p>The currently popular beauty and body methods include the following types, and their results are described separately below:</p>
<p>Wrinkle Removal Method When people reach old age, their blood is insufficient, and wrinkles naturally appear on their faces. This is the same reason why oranges wrinkle when they are left for too long and the water evaporates. The wonderful wrinkle removal method used by beauticians is not to fill in the wrinkles and moisturize the dryness, but to cut off a part of the loose and wrinkled skin. The method is to choose the end of the hair behind the ear (the edge of the hair behind the curved ear), make a small incision with a knife, and tightly pull the skin of the face until there are no wrinkles. Then, the loose and excess skin is cut off and sewn with thread. The sewing place is on the edge of the hair, and it is not easy for people to find it by using the cover of the hair. However, if you are a little careless when getting a haircut, and the barber cuts it too short, there is a risk of the truth coming out. One day in the United States, a woman came to a barber shop and angrily negotiated with the barber why he had cut her hair too short, so that she could not go out to see people. The barber did not understand at first, but later he knew that the reason for offending her was that the crux of the problem was exposed. After this method is performed, wrinkles will reappear on the face after a short period of time, and it must be pulled and cut again. After several pulls and cuts, the face will lose its original appearance, and it is very likely that the eyes will become deformed. Seeking beauty will instead help ugliness!</p>
<p>Skin Rejuvenation Method The skin rejuvenation method is to remove the dry and withered epidermis and make it become tender skin. The method currently used by beauticians is: (A) Mix dry soil with water to form a thick slurry, apply it to the skin, and peel it off after it is dry and hard; (B) Melt wax into a slurry, apply it to the skin, and peel it off after it is cooled and solidified; (C) Pound water plants and called-for materials into a slurry, apply it to the skin, and peel it off after it is dry. During the period from applying the slurry to peeling it off, all of the above methods have extremely unbearable discomforts, especially the heat of the wax, which is like burning. The result is that the tender skin obtained by all of the above methods lasts for only a few hours.</p>
<p>Hair Perming The burning of hair during perming has been repeatedly heard in our country. It is not only dangerous to perm your own hair, but it is also inevitable in barber shops. The permed hair in barber shops in our country also has the regret that it will still return to its original shape after being washed with hot water and cannot last. The art of hair perming is developed in the United States. The so-called permanent waves can indeed last unchanged. The wage rate must be several US dollars. What women often complain about is not the too much cost, but the pain of perming. This kind of perming uses a perming machine, and the woman's hair must be twisted on the perming machine, and then it is oiled and permed. The beautiful women of the time, those who joked about it likened it to the Yasha, the truth is probably not far from it! After several hours of baking, the work can be completed, but the beauty that can be enjoyed is only a few months! (Generally three or four months) After a few months, the permed part will be gradually cut off because it is long, and the new part will replace it, and then it will have to suffer ten times the pain!</p>
<p>Looking at the above-mentioned various beauty methods, they all have great pain. There was a woman in the United States who came out of the beauty salon, and someone asked her how the taste of beauty was. The woman answered immediately: "Oh my god! Wonderful beauty method!" In this cry of "Oh my god", the kind of thing she suffered can be imagined! As for whether the so-called beauty must be found in embellishment, it is a matter of opinion.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Family Budget Issues <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>State organs must have budgets, commercial organs must have budgets, and families naturally need to have budgets as well. Establishing a budget in a family is really a very meaningful thing, because with a budget, although it is not possible to spend every penny according to the rational budget, and it can be completely suitable for the ideal spending, but to some extent, it can always reduce some of the imbalances in income and expenditure because there is a budget. However, in our country's families, there are also many who have established a budget that could not be more reasonable at the beginning of the year, but as a result, expenditures often far exceed income and they incur a lot of debt. The crux of the problem is naturally quite complicated, but I think the most appropriate explanation is no better than the speech given by Mrs. Mary Ful on the subject of "Family Budget Issues" at a women's and family club in London in February of this year.</p>
<p>The topic of her speech was "Family Budget Issues." She said that having a budget in a family can indicate that there must be a thrifty, careful, and responsible housewife in this family. Moreover, it is very easy to prepare a budget in every family. For example, purchase a diary for the coming year on Christmas. Once the diary is purchased, you should record what you have done every day. This matter will test whether the person who prepared the diary has perseverance. The same is true for the family budget. Once the budget is made, you should prepare a record book of income and expenditure and record all income and expenditure item by item every day, and it should be classified page by page. For example, the first page is exclusively for food accounts, the second page is exclusively for clothing accounts, the third page is exclusively for book and magazine accounts, and the fourth page is exclusively for medical expenses. This kind of account seems to be very cumbersome, but from these cumbersome pages, it is easy to compare the income and expenditure situation with the budget and reflect on whether life is reasonable. When a considerable period of time expires (assuming it is one year), then, from the totals of each special page, the difference from the budget can be compared. This kind of perseverance in bookkeeping is not without reward. The final account for the first year is a model for preparing the budget for the second year. In other words, it is a family issue of the obligatory family advisor for the second year. Anyone in the entire family can rationally relax and tighten their lives according to the guidance of this obligatory family consultant in order to suit the balance of income and expenditure and avoid the pain of debt. The matter of debt is an evil spirit that destroys happy families and plunders family happiness, but a thrifty, careful, and responsible housewife in the family can very persistently prepare a reasonable budget, balance the family's income and expenditure, and solve all the problems that are not easy to solve in ordinary families.</p>
<p>I have several friends whose families do not have a budget and do not have daily records of income and expenditure. At the end of the year, some have worked hard for a year but have no surplus funds, and some have simply incurred a lot of debts. As a result, the husband complains about the wife's mismanagement of the home, and even insults the wife for making secret savings or spending unjustifiable money. Naturally, in order to avoid their own responsibility, the wives have to attack the husband's weaknesses in a far-fetched way, and become like fire and water to each other. Is this kind of problem impossible to solve? When we look at Mrs. Mary Ful's speech on "Family Budget Issues," we feel that it is not difficult to solve this problem. It is only necessary for the housewife in each family to spare a quarter of an hour of time every day to record a few accounts of vegetables and tofu, and write black ink on white paper. Husbands for wives, wives for husbands, everyone can no longer blame each other, and perhaps because of this practical record, they can learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, so as to avoid the imbalance of income and expenditure in the next year and establish a reasonable family expenditure system, a budget, as a guideline for life.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Regarding Human Milk Nutrition <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuxiu</p>
<p>Breast milk is a natural nutrient for infants. Breastfeeding infants not only saves time but is also economical. However, due to various reasons, mothers often do not want to breastfeed themselves and mostly hire wet nurses; some also use cow's milk or formula. These inevitably have shortcomings. If the mother cannot breastfeed due to special physical reasons or illnesses, it is forgivable. However, what is commonly seen is that most modern housewives are afraid that breastfeeding will damage their beauty or hinder their social life, so they are unwilling to use their own milk to feed their lovely infants. As a result, their children fall into very pitiful circumstances. Generally, people know that the health of the human body is closely related to the nutrition of milk in childhood. I am now writing down the benefits of breastfeeding and the harms of wet nursing or artificial feeding to give a loyal warning to those who do not have diseases but are unwilling to breastfeed.</p>
<p>The Value of Breast Milk Nutrition</p>
<p>The value of breast milk nutrition Breastfeeding has the following benefits: Contains special vitamins, Contains special immunity, Suitable temperature, Because it does not pass through utensils, bacteria cannot enter, Is a natural beverage for infants. Therefore, to make children healthy, it is best to breastfeed them with breast milk. Except for those who have lung disease, heart disease, acute nephritis, or acute infectious diseases, etc., and cannot breastfeed, the rest should all breastfeed themselves. Even mothers who are thin and weak, many doctors also encourage them to breastfeed themselves. (Because during the breastfeeding period, the appetite can increase, and the nutrition they take in, in addition to providing milk, often has a surplus, or they may even become fat and strong as a result.) If the mother has syphilis, she should breastfeed herself even more. Because syphilis is hereditary, the infant is infected early when it is born. If such infants are fed artificially, nutritional disorders are likely to occur. If a wet nurse is hired, syphilis can be transmitted from the infant to the wet nurse. Therefore, it is better for the mother to breastfeed herself, and both parties will be fine. Asia has wet nursing, and if their working hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the afternoon, then wet nursing is not a problem. Because the mother can breastfeed when she goes home for lunch, she can breastfeed when she has not gone to work in the morning, and she can also breastfeed when she goes home in the evening. If the working hours are special, she can also find a way to breastfeed herself. In addition, if the mother's milk is scarce, artificial milk substitutes can be added, but breastfeeding should never be stopped. Mother's breastfeeding is not only of great benefit to the infant, but also of many benefits to the mother, such as breastfeeding the infant when it is first born can make the mother's uterus quickly return to its original position, reducing the suffering of back pain and backache in the future. This can be verified.</p>
<p>Review of Hiring Wet Nurses to Breastfeed</p>
<p>Because women's occupations are not developed and the standard of living is relatively low in China, hiring wet nurses is not difficult. In other countries, the development of women's occupations and the increase in the standard of living make it simply difficult to hire wet nurses. Moreover, from a moral point of view, hiring wet nurses is also inappropriate, because the wet nurse's infant loses breast milk and changes to an unsuitable milk substitute, which often leads to illness and death. Let us think about it, the wet nurse sacrifices the life of her own biological child to exchange for a small amount of money, and the general healthy housewife is unwilling to breastfeed herself, which violates humanity. Furthermore, breastfeeding also has a nervous relationship. Most wet nurses are uneducated. After the infant grows up, its wisdom, temperament, and habits are like those of an uneducated wet nurse. Smart and clever mothers! You may not even know why you got such a child! In addition, wet nurses often use deceptive means for their little masters, such as immediately giving them milk when the little masters cry, etc., which is more likely to develop strange temperaments in infants. Therefore, except in cases of necessity, those with healthy mothers should always try to breastfeed themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Ms. Lu Lihua Discusses the Current Situation of Women <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Chinese people are already suffering enough, and women suffer even more than men. For women who strive to work for society, the current environment is truly extraordinarily difficult... These few sentences are the experienced words of Ms. Lu Lihua. Ms. Lu has been managing women's sports for seventeen years. She has tasted all kinds of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness in society, and is still able to calmly work hard. Frankly speaking, this spirit is indelible. A few days ago, she was returning from Hong Kong, and we ran into each other. We casually chatted and talked about women's issues. Her opinions are very sympathetic.</p>
<p>Cultivate Independence</p>
<p>For thousands of years, our country's deep-rooted habit of valuing men and belittling women has unreasonably oppressed women, and this has not been completely eradicated. In the past twenty years, women have made great efforts and have won legal status, but in reality, women are still subject to too many restrictions, and are far from the stage of equality. Currently, there are quite a few women in the country with knowledge and skills, but they are still unable to contribute all of their learning to society and the country, which is a great pity. According to today's situation, women should stand up, and the prerequisite must be a healthy body. Diligently seeking knowledge, strong will, and cultivating an independent spirit are also very important. In addition to women's own efforts, for gender equality, it is also hoped that men will respect women and take a supportive attitude at any time, just like adults supporting children learning to walk. If the inherent abilities of men and women reach a certain standard, I believe that small families will reduce their burden and increase happiness, and large societies will work together to build the country, with half the effort and twice the result, which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>General Shortcomings</p>
<p>Handling household affairs is originally the responsibility of women, but they should not only take care of family affairs and neglect social work. They should divide their remaining energy to serve the public. When it comes to managing a household, I advocate economical, rational, and artistic methods to improve past bad habits. Many housewives never tidy up their homes, and spend the whole day busy, suffering a lot, but from an objective point of view, it is still chaotic and disorganized. If they can apply scientific methods, the work of a day can be done in half a day. The biggest shortcomings of women are their short-sightedness, narrow-mindedness, and lack of a broad-minded and optimistic attitude. Therefore, at home, they often argue and turn against each other over trivial matters. When serving outside, they are wary of each other and cannot respect their work and enjoy being with others. Once others gossip, they shift their will and create troubles for themselves. These abnormal situations should be avoided as much as possible. The way of husband and wife should be based on equal treatment. If a man regards a woman as low-powered and has a sense of contempt, and a woman regards a man as all-powerful and develops a sense of dependence, the family will have no happiness. I believe that "respect" and "understanding" are the elements of love, not only for husband and wife, but also for dealing with people and things.</p>
<p>Women of the Far East</p>
<p>Ms. Lu has been to many places in the Far East, and I asked her to make a general criticism of women in various places. She said: "I only stayed for a short time in the places I went to, and did not have a deep understanding. I will try to describe what I saw. In the country, I feel that women in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have taken the lead in the civilized atmosphere, and their material enjoyment is better than other places, but they are gentle and timid. Women in Central China are quite brave, especially women in Hunan Province, who have a spirit of progress. Women in North China have the virtues of perseverance and hard work. Due to geographical reasons, South China is also the hub for overseas Chinese to enter and exit, and it is more deeply stimulated, and has more opportunities to imitate Westernization and participate in occupations, so the situation is different from other places. For example, the training of professional women in Hong Kong and Guangdong is comparable to that of Japan. I have carefully observed them and firmly believe that they can respect themselves and serve for the sake of service. In foreign countries, Japanese women are extremely docile and hard-working, and they have quite a powerful force in the workplace. Women's groups have very strong organizations, but they rely on men for everything, and their civic personality is relatively low. I traveled to Korea five years ago, and the scene of national subjugation was very tragic! They have received slave education and have lost their national concept, so there is simply no women's issue to discuss. In the South Pacific Islands, such as the Philippines, women's education is very popular, and men and women are absolutely equal. Women's service efficiency is very high, and women's circles are also very connected. I visited the women's conference in the Philippines, which had more than fifty unit members, representing more than five thousand people. The atmosphere was vibrant and admirable. In the Dutch East Indies, women are especially respected. For example, if a woman hits a man, the man cannot sue, and vice versa, the man will be severely punished. It is said that Dutch society expresses respect for women everywhere, probably because of the Dutch Queen. Although the natives in the British and French territories are in a semi-civilized period, men and women seem to have complete equality."</p>
<p>Women and Sports</p>
<p>She also said that the reason why the women's issue has not been completely resolved so far is that sports are a major core issue. For this reason, I have sacrificed all my personal happiness, working hard and bearing grievances, and taking the management of women's sports as a consistent policy. Looking back on the past seventeen years, I don't know how many setbacks I have encountered, but I have never been discouraged by difficulties. Fortunately, Chinese people have a considerable understanding of women's sports. From now on, I advocate that women's sports should not be limited to schools, but should be extended from schools to families and society, expand the implementation, and the effect will be great. Sports are multifaceted and have mutually related relationships with medicine and hygiene. When the three are integrated, people can enjoy healthy happiness. We must allocate the amount of sports to our daily life, and hope that women across the country will engage in sports, work hard in sports, create a strong atmosphere, and sweep away the weakness of women for thousands of years. By that time, the entire women's issue will be easily resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e239">The Error of Celibacy (Part 1) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Xin</p>
<p>—Dedicated to Sisters with Celibate Ideas—</p>
<p>The idea of celibacy is wrong: this is something everyone should admit. Why? The so-called "celibacy" is explained as not uniting with the opposite sex. We know that all living things mostly reproduce their seeds and prolong their lives through the union of two sexes. The individual life of a living thing is very short. If the previous ones die and the later ones do not grow, then there will be no living thing in the world, because a living thing cannot grasp eternal survival. Therefore, due to the natural union of the two sexes, a new life is born, and it continues day by day with the flow of time.</p>
<p>This is even more important for people: people are animals with two sexes by nature. They unite due to the needs of the two sexes, giving new impetus and reproducing the race. This is the innate instinct of mankind. However, humans are the most knowledgeable animals, and the union of the two sexes is not something they can choose at will. In the choice of the opposite sex, they often encounter many objective difficulties. Due to the occurrence of these difficulties, the so-called "celibacy" idea takes the opportunity to enter. However, there are many reasons for the origin of celibacy ideas, which can be roughly divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Suffering from heartbreak or marriage difficulties!</p>
<p>In our era of conflicting new and old ideas, and a society where capital and feudalism coexist, marriage is the most difficult problem to solve. Many women are buried in the difficulties of marriage. Although many women have strong personalities, they do not have the courage to break through the difficulties of reality. At this time, they suddenly discovered a path—the path of celibacy. They thought that this path would make them free and never suffer the pain of marriage again.</p>
<p>(2) In order to accomplish one's own career—</p>
<p>Some women often think that doing something must be without resistance, so that they can complete it without any hindrance. Therefore, they are too enthusiastic about their careers and ignore marriage. They feel that this is the only way to achieve their goals and develop themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Seeing through the world and thinking that life is nothing more than this—</p>
<p>Marriage and childbirth are such painful and troublesome things! Some single women must think this way. Their thoughts are close to decadence. They see the traces of pain in many women, and see many women commit suicide because of heartbreak, thinking that the opposite sex is a terrible thing. At the same time, they think that the joy and sorrow of life are completely empty things, so they feel that it is better to live a free and independent life alone.</p>
