<h3 id="c13">出版法之修正 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>新出版法於去年七月十二日經立法院三讀通過後全國新聞界認爲窒礙難行羣起呼籲請求修正中政會俯順與情重訂原則交付主管機關修正迄今已逾半年日昨該項重行修正之草案始在行政院會議提出討論將俟下次中政會審核後交立法院複議至修正內容已見報端决要各點雖略有增删之處而與新聞界之所望則似相去尙遠蓋新聞界在原案中認爲窒礙難行諸端卽其較重要者在今决修正案中亦尙未予删去是則此决修正殊無多大意義可言茲謂擇要指出未删各點述之</p>
<p>現行出版法規定審核出版物之權力在內政部而出版物之有涉黨義者尙須經中宣部之審核新出版法原案則除保留中央原有之權力外又規定縣市政府得有直接干涉出版事業與先行扣押出版物之權力新聞界以縣市政府之現在組織與人才對此似難勝任愉快且原案行政處分一章不予出版界以抗吿之權倘遇地方長官曲解法意濫用職權則出版界之受其摧殘必不堪餒想故曾籲請中央刪除此項規定卽使中央以爲必須保留者亦宜予出版界以抗吿之權或另行規定地方長官對於施行該法時之限制今修正案對於原案此點仍予保存我人所觖望者此其一</p>
<p>在禁止新聞登載之事項中新出版法原案列舉禁止公開訴訟事件之辯論未經判决訴訟事件之評論及在戰時或遇有變亂與其他特殊必要時之有關政治及地方治安事項按訴訟事件在原則上皆應公開辯論惟有妨害善良風俗及安寗秩序之虞老依法律或法院之决議可停北公開故訴訟事件之應否停止公開其認定權專屬於事伴受訴之法院法院以外之人縱令以爲該案不應秘密要亦不足以左右其事件禁止公開辯論之效力而既經停止公開辯論則不得揭載該案辯論內容誠爲當然之事至禁止登載禾經判决之訴訟事伴則我人認爲實非必要蓋此項立法用意雖在尊重司法裁判之獨立要知裁判獨立之詮釋乃爲不受行政軍事權力之橫加干涉至輿論淸議之發揮正足以扶助法官耳目之未週而參衆議於法例亦符英美陪審制度之精神也至若「政治及地方治安」字樣範圍殊嫌寬泛易被濫用在新聞界允有難以適從之感曾於去年呈文中鄭重提出深望中央加以修正今决修正案中對於以上兩點依然維持原案我人所觖望者此其二</p>
<p>以上所述乃我人對於該修正案之消極威想深望中政會於審議該案時有所補救者至於我人進一步之理想則以出版法不應專着眼於新聞記事之取締尙應進而謀新聞事業之積極提倡如新聞記者之權利保障報章文字之版權認許等均應在出版法上予以規定政府當局倘能注意及此則出版法之精神當可益彰矣</p>

<p>申新紡織廠、共有九廠、除三廠設無鍚、四廠設漢口外、餘均設滬、共有紗機五二九、七八〇錠、綫機四三、九四〇錠、布機四、八六一台、自去歲設立改進委員會、銳意整頓革新、改換新式機件、並加裝精紡機等、已投資一百六七十萬元、將所有機件改成一九三四年式、而廠務之組織管理等、亦力求合理化、</p>
<p>二五兩廠現仍停車</p>
<p>該廠去年營業、因生產方法之改進、故出品精良、銷售甚暢、計每日所產紗綫八百件、（每件四二〇磅）各種布疋一萬五千疋、（每疋四十碼）惟以本年棉產較少、的僅及去年之七折、缺乏豐富之原料、以供生產、故在滬之二五兩廠、現仍停車中、聞該廠本年四·五·六各月之產品、現已全數預訂購罄、</p>
<p>實業界希各方協助</p>
<p>據實業界之表示、我國之生產事業、現在逐漸進展中、惟須各方之協助、作共同之努力、如在原料方面、就原棉一項而言、國內產額、必須改良性質、並增加產量至一倍以上、此點望政府切實提倡指導、及金融界之協助、至就麵粉工業而論、國內小麥產量、僅敷全國麵粉廠四五個月之用、故亦有推廣改良之必要、旣有豐富之原料、及精良之機械、更望銀錢業能予以便利之資助、則產業發達、國家經濟、得以復興云、</p>

<h3 id="c108">國際貿易局發表　去年桐油突俏原因　與意阿戰事有關係偶然現象　提出根本改良桐油方法五點 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>去年我國桐油出口、至爲暢旺、市價最高時、會達每担八十五元之巨、爲近年以來所罕見、但國內消費、則因人民購買力薄弱、而顯見减少、總計去年桐油出口、凡七十三萬八千八百六十五公担、較之上年增加八萬六千零二十九公担、即百分之十一、價値四千一百五十八萬二千八百七十九元、在去年出口貨價中居第一位、頗堪注目、茲據國際貿易局發表統計、及其突俏原因、分誌如下、</p>
<p>去年輸往各國數量</p>
<p>去年桐油出口、以輸往美國爲最鉅、佔總數百分之六十至七十之間、其他各國、僅佔百分之三十耳、計美國四九一·九九九担、價値二八·〇五七·二四八元、香港八七·四八一担、價値四一二九·一〇九元、英國三六·五五一担、價値二·一一七·九七四元、德國二八·九三三担、價値一·七八七·四一二元、法國三一·一五四担、價値一·七七八·七六九元、荷蘭二〇·六〇七担、價値一·二六一·四一七元、丹麥七·九六〇担、價値四七八·二四二元、日本七·八九三担、價値三六一·八六七元、義國五·三八二担、價値三二八·一二六元、端典四·三四〇担、價値二八六·六六七元、挪威四五七五担、價値二七七·五一九元、奧國三·五九〇担、價値二三五·九二五元、比國二·八八五担、價値一六四、八六八元、阿根廷一·二六二担、價値八三·八〇一元、關東州一·〇二〇担、價値四一·七八七元、印度五四一担、價値三九·九五〇元、芬蘭五〇四担、價値三一·七八五元、坎拿大一九七担、價値一九·一〇五元、其他各國一·九八一担、價値一〇一·三〇八元、合計七三八，八六五担、價値四一·五八二·八七九元、</p>
<p>桐油商人均獲厚利</p>
<p>去年湖南·四川·湖北·陝西·浙江·安徽·桐子收穫均甚豐、而其含油量亦甚佳、桐子每担市價的十九元、較前年貴七元、每担桐油須桐子二百二十四斤、故每担桐油成本至少須四十一元、經營桐油出口之商人、無論在產區或在漢口、或在上海、去年均獲利甚厚、但因存貨不多、未能儘量供給國外需要、故其所獲之利益、尚未十分滿足耳、</p>
<p>突俏原因計有三點</p>
<p>至於去年桐油貿易所以突俏之原因、約有下列數端、　美國爲我國桐油之最大銷塲、平均每年輸入、的達一萬二千萬鎊、經濟恐慌發生後、减至七八千萬鎊、近年以來、因實行復興經濟計劃、頗具成績、各種工業漸趨復興、桐油需要、乃漸復常態、故我國桐油美銷亦見增加、　意阿戰事發生後、地中海交通、時有阻隔之虞、歐洲各國、爲未雨綢繆計、莫不積極儲備原料、桐油爲重要原斜之一、需要自益增加、　我國桐油出產、散在內地、貨物運銷、頗費周折、一旦需要激增、市塲存貨吿罄、即不能源源供給、價格乃因以增漲、綜上所述、可見去歲我國桐油輸出之興旺、其主要原因、實在海外需要激　、而其價格所以增漲、然去年我國桐油外銷、雖栩興旺、但此種現象、僅爲一時供不應求之結果、而非我國桐油已在海外市塲獲有推廣銷路之能力、自難視爲常態之發展、</p>
<p>欲維永久須加改良</p>
<p>故我人如欲維持桐油外銷永久之繁榮、仍須對桐油產銷、加以根本之改良、最要者厥有下列五點、　我國桐油培植方法、極不講求、榨戶收買後、復隨意貯藏、不免發生腐爛榨油方法、亦極陳腐、故品質欠佳、色彩深淺不勻、夾雜物未能去凈、油脚過重、酸性太高、復因榨油爲手工業、難有齊一之品質、　我國榨油、墨守舊法、故搾油率極低、全國產油量、每年損失、爲數至堪驚人、　運銷手續極繁、間有商人混摻雜油、以圖厚利、品質因以變劣、影響對外信用、近雖經各埠商品檢騐局釐定合格標準、但以所定標準、較美國爲低、此處應逐漸提高、　裝運方法不佳、運費高昂、且時生阻隔、往往不能按時交貨、故市場有供不應求之虞、　桐油外銷、純操洋行之手、國內旣無直接經營桐油出口之機關、油商復不能聯絡、致市場市價、純爲外人所操縱、</p>
<p>美國目前不能自給</p>
<p>查桐油爲我國特產之一、在國際市場中、常有獨佔性質、美國雖亦從事植桐、但目前尚不能自給、若能利用時機、急起從事改良、建立國際信譽、則前途實至爲光明、改良途徑、最主要者、厥在於產製運銷、在生產方面、首應集中我國植桐、由政府匡助、以從事於大規模之種植、如此科學的方法、可以引用、品種可以齊一、生產量可以計算、生產自能增加、在製造方面、榨油應積極採用新法、俾榨油率可以增高、同時復須注意於精煉與分別油之等級、確定各等級之標準、在運輸方面、應研求經濟裝運方法、運輸機關、亦應設法减低運費、及實行負責運輸、以達經濟便捷之目的、至於貿易方面、根本要圖、在於集中出口、苟國內桐油商人、能團結一致、以共同力量爲大規模之出口組織、則我國國外桐油市場、自可日臻鞏固矣、</p>

<p>新法幣所以能挽救上海房地產之衰落，主要原因，即籌碼較前鬆動，地產押欵容易周轉；此外尚有兩點，與新法幣無關，但對地產則極有影饗，第一立法院對於地產押欵之淸理法，力謀改進與有效，第二財政部又迭令中國建設銀公司組織不動產抵押銀行，凡此一點，皆能使人心振奮。故其未來前途，或有相當希望也。</p>
<p>此外，關於上海之房地產，尚有一種新趨勢，我人須加注意，即地產成交偏於法租界及公共租界西區，新屋建築，類多外僑住宅。據調查統計所得，可列表比較如下：</p>

<p>— 鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「那些熊嗎」？羅勃有興味地問着。</p>
<p>「不，是說那些「辟爾更立人」，因爲紅種人常常和他們爲難。他們沒有足够的糧食吃，他們往敎堂去的時候路上也要帶着槍許多入死了，他們後來索性從船上遷了出來，從大石上上了岸，這塊石叫做「潑立昂斯大石」「註四）是一個有名的古蹟，蜀姨母也看見過，並且也曾用手去摸過。這些人後來將紅種人降服了，漸漸富足起來，他們都是很好；我有個遠祖宗也就從那些船裹過來的。裹面一隻船叫做梅拂羅；，（註五）他們是始創感謝節的，我們後來常常有了，我也很愛這個節的。請再給我一些火鷄罷」。</p>
<p>「我想小橋將來耍成一個史家，他叙那些事實，條理那麽淸楚」；茀力子姨丈的眼睛朝着蜀姨媽一看，充滿了笑容，同時他再以一此火鷄送給那最初遺民的後裔。</p>
<p>「我本以爲一個人到了感謝節可以儘着量去吃。但是拂朗剛才設便在這個時候也不可以多吃的』，太腓說時臉上好像有些不自在，大概是會受過什麽警告的樣子。</p>
<p>『拂朗是不錯的，所以留神你的刀又，不要吃得太飽，不然，你等一下就不能加入去做那件出人意外的事了』，蜀夫人說道。</p>

<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>離城三里路，一條田基小路　遺到　里。沒有車也沒有馬，農民們全是赤着脚來來往往，用肩膀挑着他們底靑菜，小柴和乾草，有時挑着他們底小孩子。嘴裹含着烟搖，他們底神氣是和平，强硬，然而也是深不可測地狡獪的。「　加拿洗染公司工場」——這是一個炫奇的名字。在我們前面用竹籬圍繞起來，籬巴上有一塊寫着這些白油字的黑漆招牌，再對開去是一座矮山，上面建築着種種式式的墳墓。</p>
<p>站在水淸見底的淺溪裹，小路西邊二三丈遠的地方，我們二十多個人工作着。馬森底位子就在我最貼近的左邊。我們從梳打鍋裹拿出煮過的衣服，稍爲一點水就把牠掄起半空中，使力打在石板上……重復地做着，然後用全身的重量壓下去搓出牠底污汁。泡沫濺到溪水裏，使牠變成乳白色而渾灣起來了。</p>
<p>我們停下來還沒有抽完一根烟，公司裏給我們送飯的汽車就在遠遠的東邊的公路上　着喇叭，——巳經成了習慣。但是那天因爲司機一定底老婆客病而請一個生手做替工，我們例外地獲得非常愉快的十五分鐘的休息。</p>
<p>馬森和我在對面矮山上找了一穴很乾凈的墳地，我們躺在灰沙地堂上，儘量伸直了自己的身體。灰沙很暖和，有如一塊架在火爐上的硬烤板，冬天的太陽也正用綿軟的適意的溫暖覆蓋着我們。</p>
<p>「這個天空……就是天天在我們頭頂上那一個。你相信麼？」</p>
<p>他開頭露出不能相信的樣子。「你常常去留心牠的嗎？」這樣說了，他驚異地睜開了眼睛。</p>
<p>而且還有一個慢吞吞的補足「牠對我很冷淡。」</p>
<p>我們底四週寂靜而且美臘。微風蕩着新的松林，在我們頭上沙沙地來回緩步奔跑着。　黃色的野草並不屈服地爬在地上，彷彿是被拉滿了的彈簧，渾身鼓着勁去抵住泥土底居心不良的吸力。……一匹飛鳥都沒有看見過。只有軍蟻，小甲蟲，蚱蜢，靜悄悄地在乾燥的山地上忙碌着。……</p>
<p>天空中滿佈了冬天不能够有的明朗的彩色——淡紫和淡靑，正如一個沒有被惡俗的，輕薄的，自以爲是的游玩家們踐踏過的野湖，上面浮漾着荷花的碎片。牠底橙紅色的巨大的獨眼一隻巨大到人們不能設比的火筒般的眼睛，閃着霎霎的金萬的光亮。</p>
<p>有兩道平行的雲罅直劃過半邊天空，挿進太陽的光圈裹，恰如車輛的軌道。我感到我們躺着的墳墓己經開始晃動，順着那飾軌過飛快地行駛上去了　馬森用拐肘碰我底肋骨。</p>
<p>「我說我們底舖子巳經變成亡國公司。一</p>
<p>他說這句括的態度使我歡喜。「亡國公司」是十幾年前被廣州人民創造出來的一個有味道的名詞。那時候有三大公司會經因爲專賣劣貨而被人咒駡過。……我知道馬森這樣斷定是指我們「　加拿」公司接受了一　　料而說的。這批染料由一個上海來的販賣商人備運進來，他底名字叫做鄔理甫，他把他底貨物叫做「犧牲品」。</p>
<p>我不回答他。我問他另外一件事。</p>
<p>「……後來，那上海佬說了些什麼呢，那卵袋！——他每次到省城都要駡他在上海碰見的人的，前回是他底親叔叔，再前回是他底野鷄老婆……」</p>
<p>「如果照他說，上海的學生是不對的。」馬森向我指出，「他們宣佈只有他們自己才有資格愛國別的無論什麽人都要不得。……鄔理甫非常賣力地形容那些讀書仔怎樣浮躁，怎樣驕誇，怎樣不睬別人的愛國舉動……他說有一回一個鐵匠對一大隊學生高聲叫喊，那隊年輕人居然動手打他，把他打得半死。……在上海提起讀書仔誰都覺得好笑……」</p>
<p>「他們沒有我們這里的聰明。「員生職工」——我們道里是對的。……」</p>
<p>「値不得讓這上海佬擺在嘴邊嚼。」</p>
<p>「對了。但丢那媽，——他也知道什麽對什麽不對嗎……。」</p>
<p>我們不做聲了。馬森憂悶着。他一隻手手臂屈在地堂上，翻身壓住自己的手。</p>
<p>天空做了一次更美麗的轉換。雲罅裂成更多的條紋，軌道消失了，－那獨眼的龐大的腦袋披着一綹一綹的頭髮，一直垂到天邊。紫紅色的碎片溶合成各種形狀的大塊，好像牠們就要沉落下來。</p>
<p>「你爲那上海人發愁麽？」</p>
<p>「上海人，不是的。我要做什麽事，就不關心什麽人。」馬森說了，「我不快活是爲了我底岳母。……她逼我是爲錢……她編我是爲錢……譏誚我也是錢。我今天早上狠狠地打了她。……</p>
<p>我和馬森後來大笑起來了。</p>
<p>我們需要笑。我們需要這短促而寶貴的休息。－爲了我們底無休止的工作，辛苦，窮困，和我們自己無法擺脫的，只會蛀蝕我們底氣力的憂鬱。</p>

<h3 id="c202">左拉的寫作方法 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 陳漢年</p>
<p>十九世紀後葉，自然主義小一說的寫作方法，經過巴爾扎克的手，而佛羅倍爾的手，再左拉的手，才達到盡善盡美的地步。</p>
<p>左拉他說他自己不會創造一個情節。他認爲一個人是環境及遺傳的產物，所以他寫小說，總是從這二者研究着手。他會經對一個朋友說：</p>
<p>「我在寫小說之初，是不爲情節所苦惱的，穿挿的故事放在什麽地方，什麼人物在什麽處所登場，故事的起頭末尾如何，我全然不知道。」</p>
<p>爲着研究一個人物，他總把凡是能够於他有助的各種文獻收集起來。他有三種研究的途徑：一是叙述過去的書籍；一是書面的或者口頭的證明；最後呢，是他親自到出事的地點去觀察。</p>
<p>他說：「我每作一小說，我周圍總堆滿了有關於該題材的書籍；我總要找許多專家和我談話；我還要自己去旅行，看看那地方，那地方的人民，那地方的道德。」</p>
<p>他在旅行中記着筆記。人物的面貌，風景，談話的片斷，的記載下來。</p>
<p>他然後把道些收集來的文件分類整理起來，裝訂成冊，放入美麗的護書紙內。對於這第一步工作，他稱之謂「護書紙的組織」。</p>
<p>我們可以看出，左拉在第一步工作中眞像一個可尊敬的淵博的學者。他一直是埋頭研究着，網羅着材料的，可是現在他耍走上第二階段了：這就是一想像的階段。</p>
<p>他現在開始素描。他想到那裹，寫到那裹，談不到什麽藝術和修辭，這樣他把小說的輪廓寫了出來。他再把這輪廓修改而又修改，使牠從籠統而成爲特殊的。在人物上，他先分出階層，再從階層裹把個人提出來。經過這樣一步步的素描，一連串的事變自然而然地在這些人物的周圍泛出一種浮影</p>
<p>他對於情節有了充分明白的概念後，就着手處理人物。他把那人物的過去行爲一律記載下來：事業，年齡，健康，體態，性情，習慣，社會關係等，無所不記，那樣子，活像一個審判犯人的法官。這一來，他小說裹主人翁的行爲就决定了。</p>
<p>這時，他的護書紙漸漸澎漲起來，他的工作更要精密的選擇了。有時，他寫成的小說不過上下兩冊，可是包含着那小說的材料的護書紙，其大小，。超過小說三四倍呢。</p>
<p>材料旣然收集好，他着手一一章一章的處理全醫的結構了。一他目己說：「我逐步逐步的一工作着，我删飾着我的素描，一把各個重要的事實放在適當的一地方。在人物的安置上也是一一樣：這兒叙述着身體上的形態，那兒叙述着顯著的個性；進一步，我所起提示的主人翁的心理狀態就擇定了。我傾翻着每個護書紙一切必需放在牠確當的地位；出事地點，房屋，景色……都必需依照故事的情節而分佈而穿挿得調和地。現在我已經把結構的粗綫條勾劃出來了。但這仍舊是粗糙的。每一章裹所包含的事件，是當我傾倒我的護書紙時胡亂地挿進去的。因此我在開始眞正寫作之前，不得不從「原始」的計劃裹，成堆的材料裹，定出一個「固定的計劃」來，一章一章的分開着而叉連繫着，完全依着動作進展的程序。這時候，眞像是一幕戲劇上演之前，一切上演的材料都準備好了。」</p>
<p>這是開幕的時候了。這是他工作中最愉快的一部份，也就是他寫作的最後步驟：細磨細琢地校訂，謄淸。</p>
<p>他靜靜地，有規則地校訂，謄淸着。每天寫四張原稿紙，整整齊齊的幾乎一個字也不塗改。寫完之後，就把牠置在一旁，在出版之前，他是再也不去看牠一下的。是的，他無須再看了，他在長時間的工作中己經不知修改而叉考慮，考慮而又修改過若干决，他可以這樣堅定的自信了。</p>
<h3 id="c203">談年畫 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>舊習俗中的年畫，我現在可要談的年畫，是那特殊環境下，冀省的年畫。過去冀省的年畫，大概可分作三類。</p>
<p>第一是粉連紙石印，或木板印的，顏色是大紅大綠，配色非常濃重，大半印刷得很糟，最初印到紙上黑綫輪廓，再複印各種色調時常不跟那輪廓符合，所以一個人物或其他東西到這張畫出版時，即變成一片東扭西歪的模糊影子，這種是手工業，還有一種印刷比上面說的那種較精一點的，是用新聞紙，機器印刷的，大小這兩種均一樣二尺半寬，一尺高，長方形）內容也都是取一齣武俠，滑稽，忠孝，節烈，或淫穢的舊戲，或幾個胖胖的孩子以及天官賜福，寶馬駝金一些受農民熱烈歡迎的吉利畫。</p>
<p>第二：道是有前面兩倍大的橫幅，當初不太盛興，取材也儘是舊小說之一片斷一個民間傳說，或農事豐收等故事，九一八後，又有另一種畫出現。例如義勇軍躍起抗敵，佔「瀋陽城」，「轟炸錦州」等。至廿二年末，更有傀儡登台的醜劇，馬占山雪夜進軍，及南方的十九路軍英勇滬戰，民衆便衣大刀隊的雄恣，後防的傷兵醫院與救護，在北方有二十九軍的血守喜峯口，孫殿英的孤軍深入，與天下第一關的失守等年畫出現。……比較意義深刻的有敵軍侵略領域中的民衆被殘害，被蹂躪，却也有遭捉的漢奸吃刀砍一些場面，這些畫的作者所取的材料，大都是出於各大埠的報紙書刊上之戰時攝影，及新聞記事的複寫或演義。</p>
<p>意識上有部分是含有愛國思想的，另一部分可說是忠實的報道，在表顯手法上，都承繼着以往的舊形式，因之僅能把事情不甚生動的揭露給農民，却不能感動他們的情感。</p>
<p>第三，是精緻而逼眞的小四幅書，大半是景緻，舊小說之斷腰斬背的連環圖，或較長的傳說故事，以及琴棋書畫，松竹梅之類的風雅小擺設的描繪，此外有種豎或橫的大長方盡，畫工，色調，紙料，極精美，上面印的東西，是神像，美人，名馬，中國電影明星，伶工戲裝，及披髮裸足少女，因此這畫也帶來新的影響，一般鄉鎭的富裕者家中之少年男女，均極力摸彷畫中人的衣飾裝束，所以土少爺及土小姐現時的衣着，有些不倫不類的半都市化，——這種貴重畫的顧主，均爲地主，商人，機關職員與小官吏的家屬。</p>
<p>第一類是大衆受着多少年代之惡思想麻醉，雖現時困苦不堪，也只好把幻想寄託在吉利的畫上，或因襲着那傳下來的麻醉勢力，去「欣賞」那僅有的合毒素的晝面，因爲在購買力上這種畫也算最合適的。</p>
<p>第三類，那是爲娛樂整年精力無處消用的人們的，老一輩的知道自己作惡不少，便買張神像供着，修修來世，或睹畫生情的談論些今不如古的事，順便玩點淸爽的幽雅，少壯者們却愛異地的新奇，大胆的色情，跟想多知道些其他地方有產者的享受。</p>
<p>我們這裹要注意的却是第二類，它以商人惟利是圖的出發點夾幹這份投機營業，雖內容上含有替自身說話的成份不少，而却能部分的反映現實，畫着新聞紙力量達不到的窮鄉僻壤中的功效，它確擁有廣大的羣業，雖然有時候是有毒的。然而在沒有另一種較好的大衆藝術，負起這份職務來的現在，這種年畫，自有其意義的。</p>
<p>新時代的藝術家們，請不要忽視這一部門的藝術。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c205">羅曼羅蘭的生平 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 永尼</p>
<p>今年是羅曼羅蘭的七十歲的生日，這位歐洲文化的偉大代表者的七十年的生涯標識了全世界文化進展的路碑。我們要探索他的思相發展的路程，就有重溫一下這歷史巨人的傳記的必要。</p>
<p>羅曼羅蘭於一八六六年生在法國中部一個古舊的小市鎮上一個小康的家庭裹。父親是公證人，母親是天主敎的頑固的信徒。兒童時代的羅壘羅蘭，據「羅曼羅蘭傳」的著者　Jean·Bonnerot說，大概是個恰像「若望克里斯多夫」中的奧里佛一樣長着金髮的，瘦弱的，不很高大的孩子。他從他的革命家的會祖父禀受了革命家的氣質，當他還是一個小孩的時候，一八七一年公社的記憶就深入了他的小小的腦肋，他是在法國革命和啟蒙運動的傳統裹被養育大的。他的信仰心和對於音樂的愛好却受自他母親的薰陶。</p>
<p>普法戰爭後不久，他就開始在鄉里的學校讀書了。父母的意思原希望他將來研究數理，但是抱着對於空想，傳說，信仰的强烈的需求的羅蘭是不喜歡數學科學的。他酷愛音樂，好像沒有音樂，就毫無生趣似的。這種對於音樂的無比的愛好可以說是少年羅蘭的性格的一大特點。除了貝多汶，英差特，瓦格湼等的昔樂之外，他所愛好的一件東西就是莎士比亞的戲劇。</p>
<p>羅蘭因熱中於靑樂和莎士比亞之故，在考師範學校時曾兩度落第，到第三决　僥倖考取。他起初打算研究　學，到第二年級才開始進歷史地理科。這對於他的藝術家的生涯有着極大的影響，因爲研究歷史地理的學問，達觀東西古今的結果，不但祇擴大了他的視野，使他後來成爲了超國家主義者，而且供給了他的各種著述，允其是他的傑作「若望。克里斯多夫」以偉大的構想和豐富的材料。</p>
<p>羅蘭從在鄉里的少年時代起就愛好偉大的人物，英雄，世界的藝術家之類。但是他的這種愛好却廻異於普通少年的崇拜英雄，而祇是對於那有着對神和人的深摯的愛的精神的英雄之渴仰。他醉心於反抗宙斯，偷其給人類的普洛米宙斯，對於以唯一的神的使徒的姿態出現於當時歐洲文壇的理想家託爾斯泰，不勝仰慕和傾倒。還是一個無名的法國靑年的他，竟冒昧地寫信給這位俄國的大文紊，關於如何生活，如何創作的問題，請求他指示。託爾斯泰在這對信裹感到了偉大的誠實，很例外地對這靑年寫了回信。這是一封三十八頁的長信，全體用法文寫成的。「親愛的朋友，」信是道樣地開頭着，「我接到了你的最初的信。這打動了我的心。我含眼淚地讀了。」關於藝術，他也寫下了他的意見。「祇有把人們結合在一起的藝術纔是唯一有價値的藝術。有價値的藝術家是不惜爲自己的信仰而犧牲的。一切眞的職業的先要條件，不是對藝術的愛，而是對人類的愛。祇有充滿着這樣的愛的人纔適宜於做藝術家所値得做的事情吧。」從此羅蘭就成了託爾斯泰的忠實的弟子，在他的藝衛裹而十分洪亮地響澈着託爾斯泰中義的音調了。</p>
<p>羅蘭以優等生畢業於師範柴校之後，就被學校派遣到羅馬留學。在羅馬，他看到了美麗的意大利的風景和　爛的古代的美術。他在那裹　到的莎士比亞的演劇父使地往年的夢想復活了。他立意想學莎士比亞把英格蘭表現在史劇中那樣，把文藝復興時代寫成戲劇。有一天他在羅馬的七丘之一的賈尼屈拉姆散步的時候，他决心寫一篇以歐洲全體爲舞台的作品。這就是他後來的傑作「若望·克里斯多夫」的萌芽。他死在羅馬認識了德國女革命家瑪爾維達。邁森堡（Malwida　Von　Meysenlurg）。這位一生過着悲慘，悲哀，嘲笑的生活，但始終保持着嫻靜，澄明和年靑的靈魂的老婦，可以說是羅蘭的第二母親。他寫「若望。克里斯多夫」就一半是受了她的啟發和暗示。</p>
<p>通過題爲「近代抒情劇之起源」的論文以後，他就在巴黎的師範學校擔任音樂的講師。他發起了一個和都會的資產者戲劇對抗的「民衆劇場」運動，並寫了三篇革命劇本：「七月十四』，「但頓」，『狼』。他高唱民衆的藝術（art　andtheater　for　the　people　and　by　the　people）從一九〇〇一九〇三年，寫了不少的戲劇論文，後來收在」人民劇場」一書裹。</p>
<p>一九〇四年他寫了「米開蘭基羅傳』，後來又寫了「託爾期泰傳」，和他早年的「貝多汶傳」一同形成了一系列的「英雄傳訊」。</p>
<p>一九〇四年他着手寫他的長篇小說「若望克里斯多夫』。道是他一生的大著。在這裹，作者對於資本主義的　壞作了深刻的毫無容赦的分析，把衰落的市民文化的假面完金揭破，刻劃出了一個有堅强的人格和英雄的壯志的知識份子的典型。</p>
<p>曾經一時以音樂專門家，戲劇家而知名於巴黎的羅曼羅闌，雖然寫了出色的傳　和戲劇，而且完成了偉大的「若望克里斯多夫」年紀也到四日歲了，但他　然”沒有獲得名望和金錢上的報酬。他所說的「法國輝想主義的悲劇』他算是親身體騐到了。直到一九一四年，他將近五十歲的時候，世間纔認識了作爲大藝衛家，大理想家的羅曼羅蘭的存在。法蘭西文藝院對十卷的『若望克里斯多夫』給予了獎金，同時，世界的諾貝爾獎金也頒給這部大作的著者了。</p>
<p>一九一四年對於羅蘭並不是幸福之年，世界大戰就在這一年的九月間勃發了。這對於羅蘭是一個非常慘痛的打擊。他離開祖國，逃到了瑞士，在Joutnal　de　Geneve　上發表他的有名的反戰爭的論文「超乎混戰之上」，用和平主義的武器對戰爭作了不流血的戰爭。</p>
<p>一九一九到一九二〇年戰後資本主義的危機，使許多進步作家漸漸同情於革命了，產生了結合一切同情革命的思想家藝術家的「光明團』，而羅蘭就是這團體裹面有名的一員。從一九二〇到一九二七的五年間，如他在他的論文集『苦鬥的十五年』序文裹所自認地那樣，是他的猶豫和摸索的時期，到來了才和小市民的過去訣別，加入了爲新的隊伍。有名的「向過去吿別」，就是羅蘭明顯地表示他的新的信條的重要的文獻。</p>
<p>這種意識形態上的變換在他一九三三年出版的『被迷惑的心』裏得到了反映，在一九二三到一九二六年所寫的第一卷，帶着作者的猶豫不定的鮮明的痕跡，但是最後的部份，却反映出作者的新的世界觀了。</p>
<p>不斷的文學活動並沒有妨碍羅蘭積極地去　加社會的解放運動。他的反帝反戰的實際活動是世人所共知的。而這，和逝世不久的巴比搴，和健在的高商基一樣，正就是羅蘭最偉大的地方。</p>

<p>— 梅志</p>
<p>初中是畢業了，但費盡了一切的力量也找不到一個職業。用了賭博塲中「撈本」的冒險心理，父親東拉西扯地借得了一百塊錢，我自己連日帶夜地溫習了那些功課，才考取了說是畢業後可以賺到五六十塊綫一個月的蠶桑學校。</p>
<p>進來還沒有半個月，就到了養蠶的時候。我們從前作爲課堂的叫五間房子，現在都擺滿了團扁。團扁裏放着的一粒粒像黑螞蟻似的東西，就需要我們二十多個窮女孩子的精力看護。頭眠是過了，現在正是吃葉最吒的時候。我們二十多個，常常大半夜地不得好睡。、</p>
<p>被同房的推醒了以後，我曉得快到上班的時候了。昏昏沉沉地穿上衣裳，天上的星星照着我才摸到了課學裹。頭正在微微地刺痛，眼也好像蒙上了一層薄膜。我只看到團扁　裏有一堆堆灰白色的正蠕動着的動物，綠色的桑葉，我底眼睛却很難看得到了。慌忙地抓起桑葉來，用刀切細，機械地一把把地送到團扁裹。這樣來回地跑着，腿却軟得只想向地板上躺。眼皮也死想合攏。還有十多個團扁的葉沒有加好，我是不能休息的。我毫無感覺地切着葉，眼睛常在不知不覺中閉攏了，卯一顫一顫地打着瞌睡，但舍監鐵靑的馬臉總在我眼前幌。這樣地不知過了多少時侯，忽然梭地一聲，一陳叉冷又棘的味兒直向我心裏鑽，這一驚使我大大地張開了眼睛，低頭一看，冒着熱氣的血正由我底無名指和中指上湧了出來。桑葉和刀板上正流着冒着熱氣的鮮血。我一點不覺到痛，只是這一隻手似乎麻痺了。沒有想到害怕，更沒有想到應該設法止血，只是用左手將這兩個指頭握住。血依然不斷地像兩點似地落在地板上，地板上的血，一點兩點地很快地形成了一個紅的太陽。這顏色發出閃閃的光輝，周圍的黑暗，可使我窒息，那一盞和怨女眼淚一樣大的燈光，正發出和垂死人的臉色一樣的顏色。這分貧血者底臉色似的顏色馬上使我想到了：現在正在流着我自己身上的血呀！這顏色，這顏色！啊呀！爲什麽我底臉色就變成這樣了！全房子裹都充滿了垂死人底臉色，貧血者底臉色！這是瑛呀！這是瘦李的臉，那是愛哭的芳，不好了！你們……怎麽了呵……我在了一似地大叫。</p>
<p>這聲音驚着了隔壁房裹的王，她跑進來第一眼就看到地了上的鮮血。她驚慌地不知如何是好，在門邊呆了一呆就跑了不一會，她把我們底舍監，一個五十多歲的孤寡老太婆叫醒來了。這隻母老虎，一路嘮嘮的駡着「半夜三更，大驚小怪地……」但當她進來看到我出血過多的禪師，也有點慌了。她望了一望我底手，回頭却叫王到她房裹去把水烟筒拿來。水烟筒！別人在危急之中，她可想到抽烟了麼？……</p>
<p>但王却不得不去替她拿了來。那母老虎打開烟池，抓了一把烟，望我正在流着血的傷口裹。按。啊喲！天呀！這簡直比一把尖刀刺我的心還痛。眼睛好似在冒着火花，手和跳蚤樣的向上跳，心也向上跳，臉燒得好像醉漢。我忍着眼淚聽了這母考慮一頓　話，舉着一隻正在火辣辣燒痛的手被王扶回了自己底床上。　　我給氣憤，悲凉，痛苦抓住了。想到爸爸作了多少揖才向朱大胖子用四分的利錢偕回了一筆錢的懊喪的臉色，想到進學校以後這個老太婆使我吃的苦頭，又想到找不到事做的畢業生常常回來和老太婆交涉得不到結果的情形……畢業！找事！養活一家！我捧着這一隻痛手，哭倒在床上。</p>

<h3 id="c207">暹羅反對「新書報法」 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>委內瑞拉反對新聞出版檢查勝利以後，我們以看到暹羅人民代表反對頻似新聞出版檢查條例的「新數報法」了。據二月二十九日刋載暹羅京城曼谷的電訊：暹羅議會非常會議中，人民代表提出「反對新書報法」一案，內重要理由說：「政府必須給予報界以最高言論之權，政府旣無過失，又何必怕言詞的攻擊」。結果在會議中已通過，承認原則上的理由，現正推九人審查。查該案對旅遝羅華僑的言論集會結社及敎育的橫受摧殘，其表同情。</p>
<p>要求言論自由，可以說是全世界人均有同感的。　不特是爲了爭取人民應享的權利，同時也是整個國家整個民族爭獨立爭生存的利器。委內瑞拉的反對新聞出版檢查條例，暹羅人民代表提出反對「新書報法」我們都該表示同情的。</p>
<p>至於暹羅這國家，曾經有一個居留該地很久而現在仍受着無理的壓迫的小學敎員曾經告訴過我。暹羅表面雖是獨立的君主立憲國，但是大部份的勢力是落在英國的手裹的，而最近爲了某帝國主義在該地獲得部份的勢力，所以愚民政策便跟着經濟侵略進攻了，結果便是「新書報法」的頒行，以及封閉或無理驅逐一般華僑自辦的學校，不久以前相信太家都不會忘記，暹羅排華風氣的緊張的吧。現在，他們的人民覺悟了，敢膽提出反對「新書報法」是我們不得不佩服的第二點。同時，我們更可以看到只有弱者才眞正同情弱者，暹羅的人民是並不排華的，排華不過是帝國主義的手段。</p>
<p>現在我們回來說「新書報法」的反對是吾合理吧？當然無可吾認地是合理的，只要政府還是人民的政府。如該代表所提出的理由：「政府旣無過失，又何必怕言論的攻擊？」眞正的言論並不是攻擊政府的，不過是貢獻意見和糾正那過失。對的是「事」，並不是「政府」。舉例如不久以前英法兩國人民反對「意阿和戰協定，」是反對政府不應犧牲弱小民族反予侵略者以便利，並不是反對政府，這是很明顯的。由此我們便可明瞭「政府必須給言論界以最高言論之權」的理由。同時言論也是美國防的利器，很像現在國際間的通訊社，如法國的哈瓦斯社，英國的路透社，日本的電通社，同盟社，蘇聯的塔斯社，等等那一間不是代表他們本國說話。</p>
<p>我們除了希望暹羅的政府會覺悟地還人民以自由權外，更希望各國有類以新聞出版檢查條件的不合理法令的，也自動地撤消。</p>

<p>娜拉正在向郝爾茂吿訴以後應該怎樣處置家務，外廳的門鈴響了，女僕愛蘭進來說，「有位女客要見太太」。</p>
<p>郝爾茂囑咐，不見客之後，走到書室裹去了，愛蘭領着林敦夫人進來。</p>
<p>林敦夫人：（躊躇疑難）娜拉，你好嗎？</p>
<p>娜拉：（狐疑）的好嗎？</p>
<p>林敦夫人：我看你不認識我了。</p>
<p>娜拉：我不？哦，是了！不錯！（忽然高興起來）怎麼，姬婷，眞是你嗎？</p>
<p>林敦夫人：不錯，眞是我！</p>
<p>娜拉：姬婷，你想，我竟不認識你了！但是也不怪我！（聲音放低）姬婷，你着實改了樣子了！</p>

<p>— 卓爾</p>
<p>天氣熱得很，車底容量又小，人又多，簡直喘口氣都有些困難，雖然是扯開了每一扇窗洞，但總有些窒息，頭也有些兒暈了！你如果要把頭伸出車外，那更糟，煤灰打車頭上飛來，會塗得你滿臉滿身都成了黑色，說不定也會飛了眼里去，那更加不舒服了。三等車廂底乘客也許是活該如此的吧！</p>
<p>車是一步一步地向南爬行，自然是離開家鄉一步一步地遠下去了，由於對於家鄉的留戀，和新地的陌生而感不安，人地生疎的滋味確是不好受呢　不是嗎？旣便站外呌賣者的聲調不是連一絲兒也聽不懂了嗎！眞像蹈入了異國。一切都是陌生，陌生，所熱悉的只有見慣了的火自然底景物和碧綠豐潤的田野呵！雖然如此，那時我好像是很自負的低低地說着：屬於我們底土地是多麽潦闊而美麗呵！但，卽刻就有一個沉重地打擊，打碎了這可誇的幻夢，那就是：半壁河山付敵手了！</p>
<p>…心情像遊絲一樣地飄忽，按耐不住，又像一團亂麻，不能够很快地加以淸理，回憶的片斷如走馬燈樣地在腦海中打旋，這樣，不多時就把我導入一個不可解的糾紛的境地，…我疲倦了。使我受到的新的刺激，就是在左角靠東門坐的那位友邦底大國民底那副硬板着臉的自尊自故的醜態！他底臉老是仰着，拚命地仰若，像是在車頂上有什麽可注目的事物一樣！……</p>
<p>不曉得是在什麽時候給一位老鄉攀</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>談起來，他是那樣熱烈地用着家鄉話講着？在我也感到是遇見了一個親人。</p>
<p>…「那麽，你爲什麽到關東去的呢」？我又問他了。</p>
<p>「還不是在家裏待不住了嗎？你算算：旱了又淹，淹了又旱，兵荒馬亂地，遍地是匪，在家鄉怎麽會待的住？　是誰又願意離開自己底家呢？」他說着，在他臉簡直是寫出了一個深深地苦字。</p>
<p>我，我也是由家鄉出來的呵（但我與他不同地是我拋開了家鄉，而不是被家鄉趕走。）</p>
<p>「在關東做些什麽？」</p>
<p>「混窮的人到哪里都是混窮呵！反正靠着一口力氣吃飯就是啦！」他深深地歎了一口氣，「都說在關東可以發財！發財？像咱這樣地下力吃飯的人還會發財？那眞得等太陽在西邊出來才行啦！」</p>
<p>「關東現在怎樣啦？人民也能安居樂業嗎？」（未完）</p>

<p>— 秋原</p>
<p>卓氏再將手伸了過去，抱住了她，將全身的力集中在嘴唇上，深深的吻了秋華了。雖然，卓民也並不是沒有吻過女人，可是，那一次的吻，有像這决的愉快，這决的意味深長呢！吻了，當然又吻。這種從嘴唇上傳遞過來的情威的交流，心房動跳的共嗚，使他們有了彷彿是一種更崇高的感覺——這種感覺，與其說是情感的，無寗說是宗敎的。他彷彿置身於一處高大宏敞的峨特敎堂裹，沒有人，寂寂地，秋華彷彿變做了聖瑪利亞。這種崇高的感覺，在卓民是從來不曾經騐過。從來，沒有過一個女人，當卓民同她接吻的時候，使他有這種崇高的，多少是宗敎的感覺。對於那些，接吻的愉快僅了北於接吻，如故有愉快的話。他當她們是女人，男女間的接吻，在這種塲合，也多少變成了一種手續，而不是一種儀典。可是，在今天，當卓民吻着秋華的時候，他心理上的寗靜，是無可言喻的。他感覺到，他所贏得的不僅是一個女人的愛，他找到了信仰，找到了Ｓalvation，找到了人生之所以貴爲入生。他回味着秋華剛說的：「那當然，可是我們不同」的話，愈使他心裹得到更大的滿足。</p>

<p>我們都知道。。假使有一個人要把我們强迫地去和我們的敵人去握手，那是何等痛苦難堪的事呢！</p>
<p>大　生林澤奇因受他父親的壓迫，而須要他跟一個他所不愛的女子結婚，那他底痛苦也就可想而知。他很想拿出他底毅力來反抗，但是他知道他父親的主張完全是受了他繼母底蠱惑，他的父親也是一樣的無辜，這情形，又使他將爆發的勇氣消滅了。然而，那又是使他何等難堪的事呢！</p>
<p>他覺得他自已好像孤單地在大沙漠中間旅行一樣：那一天黃沙蓋來也不知道：即一大鷲鳥飛米也不知道；即一天馬賊襲來也不知道；那一天瓶子裏的水要喝乾了也不知道。四而都是荒凉寂寞的天地，望後面不知道那裹是故鄉，望前面不知道那裹是異國。如果他的瓶子裹水喝乾了，口渴極了，這時候若是有別一個旅行者，和他忽然相遇，給他一口凉水喝，你看他要怎樣感激流涕？可是這一種旅行者，總不容易得着。</p>
<p>孤獨，凄凉，寂寞，恐慌，充滿了他整個底心　是以，他惟有將他靑春底光陰消啊在一個咖啡店裏。</p>
<p>咖啡店的侍女白秋英，一個同樣被逼出了家庭的小沙漠，而逃到這個社會的大沙漠的靑年女子。但是，她可有一個極大底期望，期望着他失踪了的愛人——李乾卿，總會有一天來找到她；爲了這，她雖然受盡州　那些輕薄客人底侮辱和欺弄，總　度底忍耐着而没有向谁抱过怨。</p>
<p>是个初冬底夜深，咖啡店裏的火盆，雖還是燃燒得那末熊熊，但大多數的客人都已與盡而散，依依不忍離去的惟有那個林澤奇。他想拿威士忌酒來麻醉他傷痛底心。後面的戲院子散了，笑語笑聲中走進來一班顧客，，當白秋英上去招待的時候，她發現了她幾年來所含辛茹苦而忍耐着期待着的希——她底愛人李乾卿。她懷着滿腔底熱誠和歡樂喊着她底愛人，她滿想把她幾年來所忍受的艱難和苦楚伏在她愛人底胸懷裹盡量地哭訴個暢快。誰知事實竟出於她意外：李乾卿早已把她整個地置之腦後而另有所愛。他本想直截了擋的不去理她，認她完全是陌路人。但他叉想到他從前曾為給她不少的情書和雙人合攝手挽手兒的一張照；這些東西，白秋英可有拿來把他宣佈罪狀以破裂他跟他底新歡的婚的的力量，所以，他又不得不以錢這樣東西來誘惑她。他便拿出一千塊錢來以買還他自己寫給她的信和相片。</p>
<p>這情形，可使旁座的林澤奇忍無再忍了。他叫白秋秋秋英不要拿他的錢；他；她不要把那一些證據還給他；而須要將他的許多罪狀宣佈於社會，以懲戒那些薄倖的人兒。但是，白秋英祇是含着滿眶眼淚這樣說：一我恕了他，你也恕了他吧！」她便把那些書信和相片都還給了他；她把那整千紅綠的鈔票毫無吝色地擲進那熊熊的炭盆，炭盆中頓時起了一陣燦爛底火花。</p>
<p>李乾卿心事已了，再也不耐煩地走了。</p>
<p>因爲林澤奇每天都來這裹的緣故，白秋英早己和他的感情頗爲融洽，林澤奇會經把他”己底苦痛述給白秋英聽過；白秋英也曾經把她自己底悲哀吿訴過林澤奇。彼此本已有着表同情底心，經過這决的推動，他倆又格外進一步深刻認識。世界上惟有飢餓綫的人們同情飢餓綫的人們；也惟　失意的人表同情于失意的人　終於他倆携起手‘來，像在沙漠中間孤單的旅行者遇到個永恒底伴侶一樣，從此不再寂寞；也不再恐慌。正如林澤奇所說：「沙漠中間有了我們這一對旅行者，黃沙會　蓋着</p>

<p>中國第二部有聲偵探片「金鋼鑽」公映的時候，廣吿上亦可用「為了本片主角問題，曾徵起本公司宣傳科全體總辭職」字樣，較諸「槍聲數百響」或許可以再多賣幾個滿座而攝製「中國第三部有聲偵探片。」</p>
<p>（子曰：中國電影萬歲！）</p>
<p>「蕩哉」白玉霜曾在天蟾客串潘金蓮，自然蠻有噱頭，最近恩派亞亦排演正宗的蹦蹦戲潘金蓮了，更因為曹聚仁的批評與聲明，大賣滿座。</p>
<p>白玉霜曾一度要上銀幕，主演「海棠紅」，不知什麼一來，毫無聲息了。電影界大家鬧着窮，原因是片子不賣錢，現在放着這位此胡蝶還能叫座的東方梅惠絲不想法搬上銀幕去，我眞為東方統一藝術社叫屈不止了。</p>

<p>Nanjing: In the past week, Japanese military activities in China seem to have taken an unusual turn. A reporter from a certain news agency inquired about the response from the relevant authorities and was told: 1. Japanese aircraft have been illegally flying over various provinces in North China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly received reports and has protested, asserting our sovereignty over airspace and urging them to pay attention. However, no formal reply has been received to date. Our government will make a clearer statement at an appropriate time. 2. It has been reported that Japanese warships have been entering Lianyungang at will, which is quite offensive. International law clearly stipulates territorial waters. Any non-free port should not allow warships of any country to enter or leave freely. The authorities have ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to report the actual situation in detail for further investigation and decision. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jinan: Doihara arrived in Jinan today for a visit and went to Qingdao in the evening. Doihara said that this trip was a courtesy visit and had no political mission. He will go to Qingdao and then to Dalian and Shenyang, return to his country after completing the special service organization matters. The Hebei-Chahar negotiations are not proceeding, and Ji Dong should be merged into Hebei and Chahar, but the time is not yet ripe. Li Shou-hsin is subordinate to Prince De of Mongolia, and outsiders believe that the Manchu army is invading Chahar, which is a great misunderstanding. I advocate Pan-Asianism, because China and Japan share the same script and culture and should be responsible for peace and anti-communism in East Asia, without allowing others to interfere. Although there have been some misunderstandings between China and Japan in recent years, both sides should unite and strive to find ways to resolve them. The new Japanese cabinet has been established, and its foreign policy remains unchanged. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin: On the 5th, the weather warmed up, and the ice floes outside the Dagu Estuary and the old location of the lightship melted. The ice floes between Tanggu and Dagu were washed out to sea with the tide, but the ice floes were still large and could not be completely melted. There are still many dangers for ships traveling to and from the area. The ice situation between Tanggu and Gugu is loosening, and the waterway can barely be opened. The Tianjin Shipping Bureau plans to wait for the wind direction on the 6th and then decide whether to rent an airplane to drop food and provide relief. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The ice situation in Dagu is improving. Japanese ships Asakuma Maru, Nippon Maru, and Nichiei Maru all arrived at Tanggu on the 5th. The Shuntian ship also left the port for Shanghai. The Changcheng ship sent a telegram to the Tianjin Customs Port Affairs Office, saying that when it reached the Lao Tiao Mountain area, there were still thick ice layers that had not melted, covering an area of ​​70 nautical miles, and asking that other ships be notified. (Fifth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Six ships trapped in Da Sanhe, including the Zhonghe, Chang'an, Zengli, Luzhou, and the lightship Haiming, escaped from danger on the night of the 4th due to the melting of the ice. The Tianxing and the Haihe Engineering Bureau dispatched icebreaking ships Ling Qing and Ling San to rescue them on the afternoon of the 4th, and encountered the six ships 20 nautical miles outside the estuary, which were then led back to the estuary. The Luzhou sailed to Yantai on the morning of the 5th, and the Zengli arrived at Tanggu in the afternoon. The remaining ships were afraid of the impact of the ice and are waiting for repairs due to leaks and ship damage, and are temporarily anchored outside the estuary waiting for relief. The lightship was docked at its original location on the afternoon of the 5th, and the navigational marks of each ship have been restored. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The six ships that arrived at Dagu were supplied with coal and water by icebreaker ships. Except for the Zhonghe and Chang'an, which need to be towed due to damaged machinery, the Zhouzhou left for Yantai at noon on the 5th, and the Zesheng and Zengli arrived at Tanggu. The Haiming lightship was reinstalled at its original location by the customs on the evening of the 5th. The situation inside and outside Dagu Port has largely returned to normal. Only four or five ships are still trapped in the north and south ports, and cannot move because the ice is still solid. (Fifth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The seven ships that were blown out to the Da Sanhe area, 40 nautical miles outside Dagu Estuary, escaped danger on the 5th. The Changcheng Maru sailed to Dalian, and the Daming lightship and the Chang'an, Zengli, Zeshan, Luzhou, and Zhonghe were towed back to Dagu by the Tianxing icebreaker ships and can enter the port immediately. (Fifth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Chunli, Zengli San, Yunting, and Yijin Maru five ships are still trapped in the south and north ports outside Dagu Port. Because the ice flow is extremely slow in that area, water has entered the forward and rear holds of each ship, and the wheels are damaged, and they have no power to move. The maritime industry decided on the 5th to dispatch the Tianxing to load a large amount of food and water, and sail to provide relief in the afternoon, and to rescue the Zhonghe and other ships that escaped from Da Sanhe. If the work goes smoothly and the weather does not change, all ships can escape danger on the evening of the 6th. The ice outside the Gukou can flow out in another two days, and the waterway can be fully opened. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: As many as twenty ships were trapped by ice outside the port of Tanggu, their hulls and steering gear were damaged, and they could not move freely, putting them in danger. The weather has warmed up since yesterday and today, and the ice is gradually thinning. Thanks to the activity of the icebreaking ships, a part of the waterway has been restored. The Changcheng Maru sailed to Dalian on the third night and regained its freedom. The Tanggu port coast is still frozen and difficult to unload cargo. (Fifth Telegraphic Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e13">Amendment of the Publication Law <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>After the new Publication Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan in the third reading on July 12 last year, the national press believed that it was difficult to implement and collectively appealed for amendments. The Central Political Council complied with the situation and revised the principles and submitted them to the competent authority for revision. It has been more than half a year since then. Only a few days ago, the revised draft was submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion. After the next Central Political Council reviews it, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The content of the amendments has been reported in the newspapers. Although there are slight additions and deletions in some points, it seems to be far from what the press hopes for. The points that the press thought were difficult to implement in the original proposal, that is, the more important ones, have not been deleted in the current proposed amendments. Therefore, these proposed amendments are not very meaningful. Now, let's select the main points that have not been deleted and describe them.</p>
<p>The current Publication Law stipulates that the power to review publications lies with the Ministry of Interior, and publications involving party ideology must also be reviewed by the Central Propaganda Department. The original proposal of the new Publication Law stipulated that, in addition to retaining the original powers of the central government, county and municipal governments would have the power to directly interfere with the publication business and to detain publications in advance. The press believes that the current organization and talent of county and municipal governments are difficult to handle this matter satisfactorily, and the chapter on administrative sanctions in the original proposal does not give the publishing industry the right to appeal. If local officials misinterpret the law and abuse their power, the publishing industry will inevitably suffer unbearable damage. Therefore, they once appealed to the central government to delete this provision. Even if the central government believes that it must be retained, the publishing industry should be given the right to appeal, or separate provisions should be made to restrict local officials in the implementation of this law. The proposed amendments still preserve this point of the original proposal. This is the first thing that we are disappointed with.</p>
<p>Among the matters prohibited from being published, the original proposal of the new Publication Law listed the prohibition of public debate on litigation cases, commentary on litigation cases that have not been decided, and matters related to political and local security during wartime or in the event of turmoil or other special needs. According to the principle, litigation cases should be debated publicly. Only when there is a risk of harming good customs and the order of peace and quiet, the decision of the law or the court can stop the public from debates. Therefore, the right to determine whether or not litigation cases should be stopped from public exposure belongs exclusively to the court hearing the case. People outside the court, even if they think that the case should not be kept secret, are not enough to affect the effect of prohibiting public debate on the case. Since public debate has been stopped, it is of course forbidden to publish the content of the debate. However, we believe that it is not necessary to prohibit the publication of litigation cases that have not been judged. Although the legislative intention of this provision is to respect the independence of judicial trials, it is important to know that the interpretation of judicial independence is to be free from the interference of administrative and military powers. The expression of public opinion is enough to help the judge's eyes and ears and participate in the deliberations of the law, which is also in line with the spirit of the Anglo-American jury system. As for the phrase "political and local security," the scope is too broad and easily abused, and the press will have difficulty adapting to it. It was solemnly raised in the submission last year, and we deeply hope that the central government will amend it. In the proposed amendments, the above two points are still maintained in the original proposal. This is the second thing we are disappointed with.</p>
<p>The above is our negative feeling about the proposed amendments. We deeply hope that the Central Political Council will make some remedies when deliberating the case. As for our further ideals, the Publication Law should not only focus on the suppression of news reports, but also promote the active promotion of the news industry, such as the protection of the rights of journalists and the recognition of the copyright of newspapers and texts, which should be stipulated in the Publication Law. If the government authorities can pay attention to this, the spirit of the Publication Law can be further enhanced.</p>

<h3 id="e16">British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Gives a Speech at the Legislative Yuan, The Organization of the British Foreign Service I <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen will soon return home. On the 5th, he was invited by the President of the Legislative Yuan to speak on the organization and service of British diplomacy. There are many political organs in the United Kingdom, and the organization of diplomacy is relatively new. However, before 1381, diplomacy was handled by only one secretary of the British Emperor. In 1541, two secretaries were added. In 1640, it was divided into two departments, one handling diplomacy north of Europe, such as France, Italy, and Germany, and the other handling diplomacy south of Europe, such as Spain. It was not until 1782 that the two-department organization was abolished and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was merged. In 1786, two secretaries were added. Later, it was said that the British political organization had a special situation. The Foreign Minister is a political official, a party member. The deputy ministers are divided into political deputy ministers and permanent deputy ministers. In 1850, an organizing committee was formed. As a result of the investigation, the examination system was adopted for diplomatic personnel. Only those who have received considerable education can be employed for one year before being formally employed. They must also undergo an interview procedure to observe their behavior and appearance. In the 19th century, 1906, active reforms began. The reason was the increase in the internal affairs of diplomacy, the increase in international relations after the European War, the establishment of the League of Nations, and the development of colonies. The increase in workload made it feel necessary to increase personnel. Therefore, in addition to the minister, the political and permanent deputy ministers, two assistant permanent deputy ministers were set up under one permanent deputy minister, and four assistant permanent deputy ministers were set up under one assistant permanent deputy minister, and various departments were set up to increase personnel. In addition, Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen also explained in detail the British diplomatic procedures. (Fifth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen gave a speech at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 5th. He first organized the organization of the British diplomatic service and interspersed it with humorous stories. The audience was very interested, such as the qualification of diplomatic officials in the past, which even included being able to recite poetry as an informal condition. In 1908, the British Foreign Office had very few telephones installed. Because the Queen did not like to read documents written by typewriters, there was no typewriter equipment in the department. Then, he described the reasons for the development of the British Foreign Office's affairs, the increase in the internal affairs of diplomatic agencies, the complexity of international relations after the European War, the establishment of the League of Nations, and the development of British colonies. He defended the criticisms of British diplomats from the outside world. Finally, he described the organization of the Foreign Office, saying that there is one minister, one political decision, one permanent decision, one assistant permanent decision, and four assistant permanent decisions. There is a general registration office and a sub-registration office, and one advisor on League of Nations affairs. (Fifth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Hirota's appointment as Prime Minister, although unexpected, is generally welcomed because it indicates that the government intends to end Japan's isolated position. A major change in foreign policy is expected, as Hirota has always advocated a policy of negotiations with Russia and China. The new Foreign Minister Yoshida Shigeru is the son-in-law of Count Makino, indicating that Makino's moderate views will have an impact on foreign policy. The new Army Minister Count Terauchi is not related to any military faction and opposes military interference in politics, so the pressure of the army on government policy may be greatly reduced. The new Navy Minister Nagano Shogo advocates a large navy policy, and it is currently impossible to predict whether the expansion of the navy by Britain and the United States will force him to advocate this policy.

<p>Tokyo: After Prince Konoe declined the order to form a cabinet, Saionji's mission to resolve the situation became even more important. Saionji's method of recommending Prince Konoe to the Emperor did not seek the opinions of senior statesmen or convene a meeting of senior statesmen, violating precedent. He recommended Prince Konoe with his own responsibility. The effect of Saionji's move seems to be a preparation for the occurrence of a political change when the genro no longer exist, that is, to create a new principle that the Minister of the Imperial Household, the Grand Chamberlain, and the President of the Privy Council will be responsible for assisting the Emperor and answering his consultations.

<p>Athens: Ethiopia has accepted the peace proposal put forth by the thirteen-nation committee without reservation. The Ethiopian government today telegraphed the League of Nations Secretariat, stating that it has acknowledged that the proposed negotiations will be conducted within the League's framework and in the spirit of the League Covenant. Italy has not yet responded, but if the reply is satisfactory, the four-month-long war is expected to end soon. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome: Prime Minister Mussolini has received the telegram from the League of Nations' thirteen-nation committee calling for peace. Italy's response will likely be decided by the cabinet meeting on Saturday. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens: The League of Nations' call for peace has arrived here and has been forwarded to Emperor Haile Selassie in Dessie. Ethiopians suspect that the thirteen-nation committee's call is merely delaying the implementation of the oil embargo against Italy. Most people believe that the Emperor's reply will state that he is ready to negotiate peace at any time, provided that Italian troops withdraw from Ethiopian territory. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The eighteen-nation committee held a meeting this morning to further prepare for the oil embargo. The meeting resolved to notify the committee of experts to prepare all procedures for the oil embargo so that it can be implemented at any time if a decision is made. The experts are currently busy considering the matter after receiving the notification. The eighteen-nation committee may reconvene on March 11 because the thirteen-nation committee will meet on that day to hear the opinions of Italy and Ethiopia regarding the peace notification. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Since the League of Nations Council's thirteen-nation committee passed the Anglo-French proposal calling for Italy and Ethiopia to begin peace negotiations, the local "Business News" expresses pessimism regarding the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's response. "According to League of Nations personnel, unless Ethiopia cedes part of its territory to Italy, Mussolini will hardly accept any peace proposal. The Italian army has recently won consecutive victories on the northern front in Ethiopia, a situation that is 'clearly significant.' In light of this, League of Nations personnel were discussing the possibility of Italy withdrawing from the League of Nations last night, and 'even suggesting that Hungary might follow suit.'" The Socialist Party's organ, "People's News," believes that the wording of Italy's reply will be ambiguous. If so, the League of Nations Assembly's eighteen-nation subcommittee will "vote on the oil embargo issue within the next week." A "Morning News" correspondent in Rome reports, "The general public in Rome believes that if the government easily agrees to a ceasefire with Ethiopia, the victories won by the Italian troops at the front will lose their moral value, as Ethiopians might think that the ceasefire was requested by Italian General Badoglio in order to ease the strain after the major battles." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome: The cabinet is scheduled to meet this Saturday. At that time, Prime Minister Mussolini will state his position on the proposal made by the League of Nations' thirteen-nation committee. Italian officials are currently remaining silent, only stating that British Foreign Secretary Eden's declaration advocating for stricter sanctions against Italy has caused a negative impression. However, the proposal of the thirteen-nation committee does not have the harsh nature of the Aidin Memorandum. From this, it is speculated that Italy will not firmly reject the proposal when responding. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Geneva: It is increasingly believed here today that Prime Minister Mussolini will accept the League of Nations' mediation of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Sources in the decision-making circles claim that if pressure is not applied to Mussolini, he will be willing to engage in peace negotiations. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Geneva: Some people in the League of Nations fear that the League of Nations Council's thirteen-nation committee's peace proposal regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute may not stop the war between Italy and Ethiopia, but rather delay the implementation of the oil embargo. They also believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may accept this proposal without agreeing to end the war, thereby prolonging the negotiations and preventing the League of Nations from implementing the oil embargo. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>London: It is rumored that if the oil embargo is implemented, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to withdraw from the League of Nations, and the military agreement previously established by Italy and France within the Locarno Pact will also be declared invalid. Upon hearing this news, officials at the Foreign Office are deeply concerned. It is reported that French Foreign Minister Flandin met with Foreign Secretary Eden in Geneva before his departure today to seriously consider this issue. According to well-informed sources, Flandin asked Eden what Britain would do if this were to happen. Regarding this matter, Foreign Secretary Eden intends to discuss a solution with Prime Minister Baldwin tomorrow after returning to London from Geneva tonight. According to political circles, the current situation is quite serious. However, it is unlikely that Britain and France will establish a bilateral agreement to replace the Franco-Italian military agreement. As for the Sky Agreement, it now seems possible to consider it, but negotiations with Germany must be held first before proceeding. In addition, regarding the start of peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia, political circles believe that although it is difficult to determine whether Italy will accept this proposal, it is likely. If Italy agrees to start negotiations, it is expected that the League of Nations Council's five-nation committee (Britain, France, Poland, Spain, Turkey) will propose new recommendations following the following principles: 1. Exchange of land between Italy and Ethiopia; 2. Economic development of the non-Amhara region of Ethiopia, provided that Italy's influence in that region is not higher than that of other countries; 3. The League of Nations implements assistance measures in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. As for the temporary suspension of sanctions, it may be implemented after the two countries agree to an immediate ceasefire. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<p>Asmara: Since the Battle of Amba Aradam began on February 10, the estimated number of Ethiopian casualties is 30,000. The 140,000 troops under the command of Ethiopian General Mulugheta Yeggazu Ymru are said to no longer be combat-effective. The number of Italian casualties is 2,000. General Ymru was able to retreat in an orderly manner due to conducting a proper rearguard action. Italian forces and Ymru's troops engaged in fierce fighting on March 2. 15,000 Ethiopian soldiers launched a rearguard attack in Afga, but the Ethiopian soldiers were excessively courageous, directly charging into Italian artillery fire, resulting in heavy casualties. According to the opinions of various Italian commanders, General Yeggazu erred by allowing his troops to fall between two Italian columns when he had the opportunity to retreat in an organized manner. Ethiopian Minister of War General Mulugheta is blamed for not conducting a rearguard action and allowing his troops to retreat in disarray, resulting in the loss of good military strategy. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome: A communique was issued here today stating that the Ethiopian army under the command of Ymru suffered a disastrous defeat after three days of fierce fighting with Italian forces on the northern front. This battle was one of the most intense of the war. The Italian Second Army Corps advanced through the Seracela Plain and encountered strong resistance from the Ethiopian army. The Ethiopian army used the latest attack methods and even charged the Italian artillery, approaching within 300 yards. The Italian artillery fire was intense and unapproachable. After three days of fierce fighting, the Ethiopian army fled in disarray towards the Tahtay River, attempting to cross it to reach the other side. However, the Italian army had conducted an encirclement, causing the Ethiopians who were crossing the river to be heavily bombarded by Italian machine guns. At the same time, airplanes dropped bombs from the sky, resulting in piles of corpses on both sides of the river, reaching as high as six feet in some places. General Ymru has fled to the province of Goggam. The number of Ethiopian soldiers killed in this battle is likely to be in the thousands. The Italian army is now advancing towards the Danbena border.

<p>Asmara: After three weeks of major battles on the northern front in which the Italian army achieved three victories and annihilated 100,000 enemy troops, someone asked General Badoglio, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, what he thought of this. The General replied, "Now it is no longer a major battle, but merely mopping up the remnants. General Yeggazu's army has not only been defeated but also completely routed. The amount of weapons and ammunition abandoned by the Ethiopian army is unprecedented in Ethiopian history." (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Asmara: The Italian General Headquarters here recently issued a battle report stating that the total number of Ethiopian casualties on the northern front from February 10 to March 3 was 30,000.

<p>Ethiopian Tigray Front: Italian forces recently achieved another victory in the Shire region of northern Ethiopia, defeating the 25,000 troops led by Ethiopian General Nashmiu. With this, active military operations in the Danbena region have come to an end. It is reported that after occupying Enba Alagi, the Italian army immediately advanced south, but the Ethiopian army in the Shire region put up strong resistance, preventing the Italian army from making a major advance, resulting in this battle. The Garibaldi Division was the most prominent Italian unit involved in the battle, and the total number of Italian casualties is said to be only 700. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Naples: In the recent battle in the Danbena region of northern Ethiopia between Italian and Ethiopian forces, the Italian air force assisted in the operations and bombed Ethiopian positions.

<p>Los Angeles: The United States recently discovered a naval espionage case. Because of its complexity, the State Department has requested the local court here to conduct a confidential and careful investigation. A 27-year-old retired sailor, Thompson, is a major suspect because Thompson wore a naval uniform and secretly visited various ships to examine their speed. According to a witness, Langby, there is also an oriental who is now on the run. According to officials in charge today, documents from all ships during the spring maneuvers in 1934, including those of several ships, have been stolen.

<p>London: The 1936 army budget totals £49,201,000, an increase of £5,730,000 over last year. Of this, £1,555,000 is the cost of special projects adopted due to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. This budget does not include the cost of expanding national defense as proposed in the government's white paper. Secretary of State for War Cooper said in his statement that it has been decided to establish a mechanized automatic team supplemented by a tank brigade in the existing cavalry division, and it has been decided to convert the infantry into three brigades, each with three rifle battalions and one machine gun battalion. The number of army personnel will increase by 6,200 to 158,000 to provide for air defense development, naval defense renovation, overseas fortified port garrisons, and the allocation needed during army conscription. More powerful anti-aircraft guns are being tested. The army's air defense equipment is being implemented. The general allocation of major infantry battalions is largely the same as in 1935, except that an infantry battalion will be stationed in Malaya. Due to the situation overseas, the army has already made temporary allocations. Light artillery brigades will be converted into field artillery brigades, equipped with four-point-five howitzers and one eighteen-pound heavy gun. The manufacturing of new Bran-type machine guns is currently in preparation. Anti-tank rifles have now been adopted as the first line of defense against armored vehicles. The latest light tanks, which have proven effective, will continue to be manufactured this year. Other new tanks and armored vehicles will also be tested soon. New machine gun mounts have been tested and have achieved excellent results. Small four-wheeled vehicles used for the first line of transport have now been developed to the point where they can replace horses. A type of wheeled vehicle has been tested in the cavalry and has performed very well in the fields. This year, it is planned to use it in a regiment to tow field guns. A six-wheeled light vehicle is also being tested. At the beginning of this year, the regular army will be 10,000 men short of its authorized strength, and 26,000 men will be discharged during the year, so 36,000 new recruits will be needed. There has been a severe shortage of volunteers in recent years, but the physical fitness of new recruits is now improving. The army reserve can be increased to 8,000 men. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<p>London: This afternoon, German Ambassador to the UK, Herr von Hoesch, accompanied by Naval Attaché Wiesner of the Embassy, held talks at the Admiralty with First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Monsell, Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Chatfield, and naval expert from the Foreign Office, Craige. The British representatives informed Ambassador Hoesch of the results of the recent discussions between the delegations of the UK, France, and the United States. It is reported that Germany did not raise any substantial objections to any of the points already agreed upon by the UK, France, and the United States. However, it expressed hesitation about the UK and Germany signing a bilateral agreement before the Soviet Union agrees to conclude a similar agreement. As for the issue of quantitative limitations, Germany has not raised it at this time, nor has it insisted that the Soviet Union must accept quantitative limitations, which is contrary to initial expectations. In the UK, it is believed that future naval treaties contain safeguard clauses, and if any clause in the naval treaty is not complied with by any country, Germany and other signatory countries will demand revisions based on the safeguard clauses. Therefore, the issue of the Soviet Union accepting quantitative limitations does not need to be raised. (It means that if the Soviet Navy expands significantly in the future, Germany can demand revisions to the naval treaty.) So far, the UK has not formally consulted with the Soviet Union on the issue of concluding a bilateral agreement between the UK and Russia, but is only informing the Soviet Union of the progress of the naval negotiations at any time.

Naval circles here are quite optimistic about the signing of the future naval treaty, believing that if no unexpected complications arise, all major technical difficulties have been resolved. The so-called unexpected complications are that Germany may raise new demands for signing an Anglo-German agreement, but there is no indication of this at this time. The U.S. delegation sent a request to Washington today, and it is now known that the instruction sought is only for the drafting of the naval treaty and is not related to any major issues.

<p>Washington: Austrian Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg arrived here last night and is scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Suvich today, then proceed to the Palazzo Venezia to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. Officials in Italian and Austrian circles here consider Starhemberg's visit unimportant, but political observers believe that the discussions held today by the Italian and Austrian authorities are preparatory work for the upcoming conference of Italy, Austria, and Hungary.

<p>Vienna: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in a speech at a cabinet meeting yesterday, stated that although various countries have attempted to resolve the Danube River issue, they intend to do so without Italy's participation, or even to Italy's detriment. Political figures here recently commented that Mussolini's statement likely refers to a plan proposed by a certain Czech politician, advocating for the replacement of Italy with Soviet Russia to ensure stability in Central Europe, given Italy's focus on the war against Abyssinia. Political figures also stated that Mussolini's recent initiative for talks between Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Rome stems from his deep belief that if Italy, Austria, and Hungary and the Little Entente countries wish to approach each other, they must start from the Rome Accords signed by the three countries in March 1934. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to observers, as the countries of the Danube River basin are preparing to establish a system of balance of power, relations between Italy and Germany have improved, making it easier for Germany to join the Danube River organization. The active involvement of German Ambassador to Italy, Hassell, indicates Germany's great concern for the Danube River issue. It is rumored that Italy and Germany have reached an agreement advocating that Germany temporarily guarantee the status quo of Austria. Political figures here do not overemphasize this, but say that the Danube River issue will have important developments on the 10th of this month, at which time a major change will definitely occur in Italian-German relations. Note that the 10th of this month is the date of the continued meeting of the League of Nations Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee, at which time the replies submitted by the Italian and Abyssinian governments on the issue of peace negotiations will be discussed.

<p>Paris: Albania, on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, was recognized as an independent state by the Paris Ambassadors' Conference (1921) and was allowed to join the League of Nations as a member. Italy then concluded a military alliance treaty with Albania in 1927 and signed the Treaties of Tirana with Albania in 1926 and 1927, stipulating that Italy would provide Albania with a certain amount of financial assistance annually. However, since 1932, the payments have stopped, leading to disputes between the two countries. According to a report in the Paris Echo, after lengthy negotiations, Italy and Albania signed an agreement yesterday to end the dispute. According to this agreement, the Italian government will still provide Albania with no more than eight million lire annually, and King Zog I of Albania will use this money for the construction of highways and the improvement of the port of Durrës, and will hire Italian technicians to assist in the management. Albania will grant Italy the general rights to forests and mines. It seems that Italy, whose influence in the Balkans has long declined, is allowed to rebuild its power. Since Turkey joined the Balkan Entente last spring, Italy has lost influence, and it wants to revitalize it, and it will have the opportunity to actively act again. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">United States Purchases Newly Mined Silver from Canada; To Achieve a Gold-Silver Ratio of Three to One <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department announced today that the purchase of newly mined silver from Canada will now be handled entirely by the Bank of Canada, the same as the method used by the United States in Mexico. This move has no special significance, but is merely intended to concentrate the purchase of new Canadian silver at market prices. According to some observers, the U.S. Treasury Department has an agreement with Canada stipulating that the U.S. Treasury Department will purchase all or part of the silver produced in Canada. Canada's annual silver production is 16,400,000 ounces. Now, all the silver produced in the United States and Mexico is owned by the U.S. Treasury Department. If Canada's production is also purchased by the United States, the U.S. Treasury Department will hold 63% of the world's total silver production. It is widely believed that the new U.S.-Canada agreement must contain a method for the U.S. Treasury Department to gradually withdraw from the world silver market. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: It was announced here today that the U.S. government will soon purchase newly produced raw silver from Canada. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has instructed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to act as the Treasury Department's agent and purchase from the Bank of Canada, with market prices as the standard. The impact of this move on the U.S. silver purchase policy is still unclear today. Treasury Department officials said that the new plan does not hinder the government from continuing to purchase Canada's existing silver. It is understood that the Treasury Department will proceed on both fronts, purchasing all new and existing silver from around the world, and may still purchase futures in the Montreal market. Non-official sources said that the Treasury Department has not stipulated the amount of Canadian raw silver to be purchased. The Treasury Department claims that this move will not have much impact on the silver purchase policy. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>London: Regarding the custom of Mui Tsai in Hong Kong, the House of Commons has already held multiple discussions. During the meeting this afternoon, Member of Parliament Wedderburn again raised this issue to Colonial Secretary Thomas, asking: "The review committee has reached a conclusion on the report submitted by the investigation committee. Is Your Lordship aware of this? Also, can Your Lordship provide an outline of the actions Your Lordship intends to take on this issue? As for the Kowloon area of Guangdong Province, China, which has long been a breeding ground for the abduction of women and children, it was recently reported that 11 women and 9 children were rescued from an abduction case. Can Your Lordship, when necessary, consult with the Chinese authorities to pay attention to this matter?" Thomas replied, "Regarding the Mui Tsai issue, Hong Kong Governor Sir Galtres will submit a report in the coming days. The government authorities are seriously considering this custom, and the entire nation hopes that it will be abolished soon. I dare to assert that wherever the British flag shines, this custom must be abolished one day. That is what I am striving for. However, the question of how to achieve the goal of abolition in the most convenient way is something I would like to ask the members of parliament." As for whether to invite the Chinese government to cooperate on the matter of trafficking in women and children in the Kowloon area, Thomas only said that the entire issue is currently under comprehensive consideration.

<p>Nanjing: Huang Shaoxiong previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce had formulated seven measures to relieve industry and commerce, requesting that the three central banks of China, Communications, and Jiaotong provide loans of 2 million yuan to the specially established committee for relief. It is now understood that the Ministry of Finance believes that industrial and commercial loans must be based on the principle of providing adequate collateral. If borrowers can provide reliable collateral, they can directly apply for loans from various banks without the need for the Ministry of Finance to forward special cases. Providing real estate and houses as collateral is inconsistent with the regulations of the three banks. The ministry is currently preparing to establish a real estate mortgage loan bank, which will be established soon. It will order branches to be established in accordance with local financial conditions to handle loans. It has already replied by telegram. The Hunan Provincial Government also consulted the ministry, requesting the establishment of a trust bureau in Hunan to implement real estate mortgage loans. The ministry has also replied in accordance with the above situation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Hebei Province Actively Prevents Communism; Implements Regional Suppression Methods; Rectifies Security Regiments Throughout the Province <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Since the disturbance caused by Liu Guitang's bandit forces in Hebei Province, it took more than forty days to quell the rebellion, with great effort and expense. However, the defeated bandits fled in all directions, scattered in Qingyuan, Julu, Nanhe, Dacheng, and other places, colluding with local gentry and bandits. Although they do not dare to openly rebel, hidden dangers remain, and they may attempt to cause trouble at any time. However, this is not the most serious problem. What is currently sufficient to plunge Hebei Province into great chaos is the communist bandits in southern and central Hebei. This is because the Sichuan bandits fled north, encroaching on Shanxi and Shaanxi. Their mobile detachments infiltrated Hebei Province, inciting ignorant people to riot, in order to hinder the implementation of the North China anti-communist plan. According to recent investigations by the authorities, communist bandits have a general headquarters in Shunde, and branch offices in Yaoshan, Renqiu, Julu, Renxian, Daming, Qingfeng, and other counties. The pseudo-chief Liu Wenzhong calls himself the commander-in-chief of the pseudo-Red Army, and the pseudo-deputy chief Liu Zhenru calls himself the commander of the guerrillas. A pseudo-guerrilla headquarters has been established in Longping County, gathering more than 2,000 pseudo-soldiers. In addition, scattered bandits such as Liu Guitang and Liu Zhinan, as well as gang bandits such as the Yellow Sand Society, Red Spear Society, and Jinsheng Tao from the Daming area, have been recruited and organized into black teams, lurking near Shunde, under the command of Liu Wenzhong, commander-in-chief of the pseudo-Red Army, to act together. Shunde, Daming, and more than twenty other counties have suffered years of famine and the people are living in misery. Moreover, after being burned and looted by bandits such as Liu Guitang and Liu Zhinan, the situation has become even more dire, with most families impoverished and unable to make a living. Once communist bandits promote and incite riots, it is extremely easy to succeed. Therefore, the people in Xingtai, Baoding, and nearby counties are all in an unstable state. The Hebei Provincial Government is also fully aware of the dangerous situation. Therefore, in addition to dividing the province into four regions and making every effort to search and suppress bandit forces, it has also clarified the responsibilities of the various armies stationed in the province. After the anti-bandit responsibilities within each region have been divided, the provincial authorities are still worried that the arrangements are not thorough enough. At the end of last month, Zhang Yunrong, the provincial security commander, representing Song Zheyuan, chairman of the provincial government, convened a meeting of responsible officers in Baoding. Many resolutions were made regarding the suppression of bandits and the maintenance of public security. The officers of each army division have returned to their defenses to carry out strict deployment. The provincial government is still worried that the precautions are not sufficient, giving the communist bandits an opportunity to take advantage. It has ordered each county to recruit strong men separately and organize them into security regiments, under the direct jurisdiction of the security commander. They are collectively referred to as security regiments, and all command authority is under the command of the security commander Zhang Yunrong. The funding for the militia in each county will also be transferred to the province in the future, and each regiment will directly apply to the security command headquarters for payment, eliminating the need for county governments to impose levies on the people on various pretexts. The provincial authorities believe that Guangxi is the best in the country in organizing militias and intend to send personnel to investigate and learn from it. According to the provincial authorities, before the communist disaster becomes serious, Hebei and Chahar provinces will first strengthen their forces by rectifying national defense. With adequate preparations, they will prevent external communist bandits from crossing the Lei Pool even one step and continue to search and suppress internal communist bandits to prevent them from spreading. At the same time, Daming, Handan, and other counties in southern Hebei, which border Shandong Province, will install long-distance telephones and adopt a policy of close contact. In the event of an incident, communication will be smooth, and responses will be swift. The wiring is being rushed from the Daming side. (3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Matsui Iwane Arrives in Xiamen; Directs Japanese to Establish the Asia Association; Leaves for Fuzhou by Boat After Staying in Xiamen for One Day <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: Japanese Army General Matsui Iwane toured Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces last winter, advocating the Greater Asia Doctrine. On the 2nd of this month, he traveled south from Tokyo, passing through Guangdong and Guangxi. On the morning of the 1st of this month, he took a Shanghai-Guangdong flight from Guangdong and arrived in Xiamen at 10:00 am. Japanese Consul in Xiamen Yamada Yoshitaro, Chairman of the Japanese Residents Association Takemura Masahide, Chairman of the Taiwan Public Association Lin Mutu, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese residents, all went to the seaplane station to welcome him. After Matsui got off the plane, he went to the Japanese Consulate first. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the Taiwan Strait Public Association and the Bank of Taiwan at the Seaside Hotel. At 2:00 pm, he convened a meeting of Japanese and Taiwanese people at the Yamato Club on Gulangyu to prepare for the organization of the Xiamen Greater Asia Association. Takemura Masahide was elected chairman, and the following matters were resolved: 1. The chairman shall nominate the drafters of the association rules and the directors. 2. The association shall be an independent group in Xiamen. 3. The association shall be established at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. 4. The membership fee shall be ten yuan per year. 5. Members must be recommended by two officers before they can join. It was decided that Matsui would recount his travels to the south and the Greater Asia Association. He said, "At the end of last year, I toured Manchuria and North China for two months. This time, I will visit Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi in South China, meeting with various important people and various sectors of the people. All of them greatly resonated with my advocacy of the Greater Asia Doctrine. China and Japan have had contact for more than 2,000 years, but the relations between the two countries have never been as treacherous as in recent years. I dare not claim that Japan is completely right. Both sides have responsibilities and need to reflect on them. Although there are various reasons, since the Eastern invasion of Europeanization, many people who are obsessed with Europe and the United States have forgotten the ancient Eastern morals and culture. It is also possible that the actions and ideas and political relations between governments have caused such estrangement. Fujian and Taiwan are not only geographically close, but also have many ethnic ties. They are truly inseparable. My advocacy of the Greater Asia Doctrine over the years is based on this viewpoint. Xiamen is the economic center of Fujian and has an important relationship with Taiwan. I hope you will work hard." Then, Taketoh, a member of the Asia Association who traveled with Matsui, gave a speech, congratulating the recent establishment of the Xiamen Greater Asia Association. It was found that the Xiamen Greater Asia Association was established because Matsui, when he previously passed through Xiamen on his way to Guangdong, instructed the Japanese and Taiwanese people in Xiamen to organize it in advance. A preparatory committee was immediately established. Now that Matsui has come again, he has concluded the preparatory work and scheduled the establishment. During Matsui's stay in Xiamen, he did not socialize with people from all walks of life. On the 2nd, Matsui took the Haiyang ship to the province. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Anhai, Quanzhou; Smugglers Operate Private Companies; Large-Scale, Closely Organized; Smugglers Collude with Local Residents and Share Profits <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: In Xiamen and along the coasts of southern Fujian, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, the practice of tax evasion and smuggling has been extremely prevalent in recent years. Although customs patrol ships have been cracking down severely and making continuous seizures, it has not been curbed much. At the end of last month, the Third Pacification Command of Quanzhou cracked down on a large-scale smuggling organization, Nanshun Trading Company, in Shishi, which was one of them. Recently, it has been further discovered that there is an even larger-scale smuggling company in Tatu Township, Anhai, outside the South Gate of Quanzhou. The organization and content of the company were found to have been established in Shanyao, Huian County three years ago. In July of last year, it was moved to Yongning Port, Jinjiang. In January of this year, it was moved to Tatu Township, Anhai. Recently, a certain seafood shop owner from Kaiyuan Road, Xiamen, and a national from a certain country invested heavily to expand the organization and connect with smugglers from various places. Four small smuggling companies were merged into this large-scale organization. One of the four small companies is on Kaiyuan Road in Xiamen, one was founded by a national from a certain country, one is operated by smugglers from Daku, Huian County, and one is a powerful smuggler in Tatu, Anhai. The capital is 600,000 yuan, of which 300,000 yuan has already been collected. The remaining shares are reserved for influential parties to join. A week ago, several smugglers from Xiamen, along with a dozen or so nationals from a certain country, went to Quanzhou and stayed for several days. Their mission was to solicit shares for the company. The company uses sailboats exclusively for smuggling. It owns more than 30 sailboats, equipped with more than 200 rifles, with seven or eight rifles on each boat, for resisting customs patrols. The reason for using sailboats exclusively is that sailboats travel silently. Customs patrol ships are equipped with listening devices that can detect the sound of distant motorboats. The company also has its own small radio station, which can send and receive telegrams and communicate with smuggling organizations on Taiwan Island. It is scheduled to send a dispatch every three hours. In case of emergency, it will send it at any time, specifically reporting the anchorage of customs patrol ships and the news of their return to port to add coal and water. If it detects that a customs ship is anchored or entering the port to add coal and water, it will immediately dispatch a report to the smuggling organizations on the island and set sail to Quanzhou at any time. Each of these more than 30 sailboats is dispatched every hour or half hour, with each boat loaded with goods waiting to be shipped at any time. If they encounter customs ships along the way, the first ship will be seized, and the subsequent ships can be expected to change course. Moreover, each time a customs ship seizes a boat, it must be escorted back to Xiamen. After the customs ship leaves, the remaining ships will take advantage of the gap to steal through the waves. According to their calculations, if two out of every three ships of goods can pass, they have already broken even, and if they can pass more, they will profit. In addition, they also spend heavily to bribe public officials in the agency. Those who receive their subsidies protect smuggling and transmit news, reporting the specific actions of customs ships and other related news. Therefore, smugglers can receive information quickly and travel unimpeded. The company's general headquarters is located in Tatu, and it also has loading and unloading docks in Shenhu and Xunpu. The land transportation route is divided into Tatu, passing through Hecun, Xuxikeng, and other villages, turning into Kemu, turning west into Anhai, turning north into Zhanglin, Qianpu, turning into Anxi, Nan'an, and other places, and turning east into Shishi. Waterway transportation is unloaded near the river in Quanzhou City, imported into Quanzhou City or transferred to Huian. It is reported that in January of this year, the amount of white sugar smuggled into the country and unloaded near the river in Quanzhou City alone was more than 500 bags, each bag weighing 300 pounds. The Nanshun Trading Company seized in Shishi is far less large-scale than Tatu. Recently, people in the company have been moving to other places, saying that the secret has been leaked and the Quanzhou Pacification Department is paying attention to the investigation.

<h3 id="e70">Garrison Troops in Fujian Province Pursue and Suppress Bandits Who Looted Vehicles; Bandits Occupy the Junction of Minhou, Fuqing, and Yongtai Counties; It is Ascertained that the Bandit Leader Who Looted the Vehicle is Shi Lang <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since February 24th, after the long-distance bus on the Fuquan Highway was robbed at Fang Kou, at the junction of Minhou and Fuqing counties, and more than 20 passengers were taken away, the provincial government immediately ordered the Fifth and Tenth Regiments of the Provincial Security Forces to each send two companies, with Zhu Wenbo, the commander of the Fifth Regiment, as the commander, to lead the troops to pursue and suppress the bandits. Up to now, for ten days, the hostages have not been rescued, and the authorities are quite anxious. Until recently, the pursuing and suppressing troops have learned that the bandits are entrenched in Niutou Mountain, at the junction of Minhou, Fuqing, and Yongtai counties. The hostages are held in Chenzhong Ao (晨鐘出), where the defensive works are very solid and equipped with machine guns and other sharp military equipment. Currently, the troops have surrounded and locked the entrances and exits of the two mountains and are attacking on one side. It is expected that there will be fierce battles in the next two or three days. As the bandits are currently busy resisting the army, they have no time to consider the ransom matters. Rumors that each hostage has been priced at 10,000 yuan are likely untrue. As for the bandit leader, Gao Chengxue himself, he is still in Taiwan. The one who orchestrated this vehicle robbery is actually Shi Weigeng, formerly the commander of the pseudo-independent 15th Regiment who harassed the counties of Lianjiang and Luoyuan in eastern Fujian, who has changed his name to Shi Lang. Wei is from Lianjiang and also a graduate of the Fuzhou Private Law and Politics College. He was a classmate of Gao Chengxue. After Wei failed last spring, his troops scattered and his military equipment was lost. He fled to Taiwan, where he met Gao Chengxue. Gao provided him with military equipment, which was smuggled from Taiwan to Fuqing by sailboat. He gathered his own and Gao's former subordinates, and reorganized his forces. Since the discovery of this group of bandits in Fuqing, the atmosphere of banditry has suddenly intensified. The force led by Cai Birong of Dongzhang Town in that county is said to be quite large, calling themselves the Workers' and Peasants' Guerrilla Brigade. Among them, there are many middle school graduates, who serve as false positions such as captains and staff officers, wantonly disturbing the surrounding villages, causing great suffering to the people.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: The area bordering Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Henan in eastern Hubei is the area where Kuang Jixun, Xu Xiangqian, and Xu Haidong, the major bandit groups, are entrenched. After Kuang, Xu, and others were suppressed and fled westward, the garrison troops began to engage in rural pacification and post-war work. However, the border area is mountainous, making it easy for scattered bandits to escape and gather again. In recent months, they have regrouped, harassing the counties of Huangmei, Guangji, Qichun, Xishui, Yingshan, Luotian, Macheng, Huang'an, and Huanggang, as well as the border areas of Henan and Anhui, looting and attacking cities, seemingly with the potential to revive. The largest group is Gao Junting's force, which has about seven or eight hundred to more than a thousand men and guns, currently within the territory of Huangmei and near Taihu in Anhui. Peng Juqing's force has more than a hundred men and guns, their whereabouts erratic, attacking here and fleeing there. There are other small groups of scattered bandits who appear in the mountains around Yingshan and Luotian, disturbing the residents. Chiang Kai-shek previously appointed Wei Lihuang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, responsible for advancing the suppression. After Wei consulted on strategies in Nanjing, he has arrived in Wuhu and will be stationed on the Hubei border to supervise the troops within days. Yang Yongtai, the Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government and concurrently the Commander of the Security Forces, has also appointed Ding Bingquan, the Director of the Security Department, as the Commander of the Eastern Hubei Pacification. His headquarters is scheduled to be established on the 5th. The internal organization is simplified, without departments or sections. In addition to the Chief of Staff, there is one secretary, one chief adjutant, and several other staff officers and adjutants, all transferred from the Security Department and not separately appointed. Ding is scheduled to lead Chief of Staff Wu Zhongxing, Secretary Zai Zhijie, and all accompanying personnel to depart for Eastern Hubei on the morning of the 5th, first to Wuxue, to assess the severity of the bandit situation in each county, in order to determine the strategy and the location of the headquarters. The affairs of the Security Department will be handled by Deputy Director Jin Jutang. The authority of the headquarters is to be responsible for dispatching the security teams of the ten counties of Huangmei, Guangji, Qichun, Xishui, Yingshan, Luotian, Macheng, Huang'an, Huanggang, and Huangpi in eastern Hubei, and to direct the pacification of the remaining bandits. Although it is directly subordinate to the Provincial Government, it is still subject to the control of Wei Lihuang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacification of the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, so that military orders can be unified.

<h3 id="e72">Lianghuai Transportation Commissioner Rectifies Salt Tax Revenue; Salt Storage in Bengbu Affects Tax Revenue; Inviting Merchants to Contract for Additional Transportation of Salt <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Huai salt merchants operating in Bengbu have always taken an average approach. It was once stipulated that the monthly salt storage should be limited to 300,000 market dan, estimating sales for three months. Unexpectedly, in recent years, the transportation merchants with relatively strong capital have suddenly changed the rules, increasing the transportation of salt. Each shipment actually reaches 100,000 market dan, all transported from northern Huai. Currently, the salt stored in the warehouses is more than 700,000 market dan, breaking the equilibrium. Small-capital transportation merchants want to transport more but lack the financial resources, transport less and have no profit to be made. Moreover, the rotation restrictions require them to wait in line and cannot freely compete for sales, making it difficult to wait for a long time. The interest on bank loans and the rent for storing salt in warehouses all increase costs, and the price of salt is invisibly increased. The rotation system has also become stagnant, because old salt has not been sold, and new salt cannot be transported, leading to a sharp decline in tax revenue, which greatly affects the national treasury. Yao Qunyu, the Lianghuai Salt Transportation Commissioner, in order to rectify salt taxes and increase revenue, opened up another path. After submitting a report to the Ministry of Finance and obtaining approval, the additional transportation of salt to the Anhui and Henan shores was contracted out to merchants. The Transportation Office specifically stipulated the amount of tax to be paid to the Anhui and Henan shores. For February of this year, the market tax is 400,000 market dan, that is, out of the 400,000 dan of additional transportation, 360,000 market dan for Bengbu, 32,000 market dan for Mingguang, and 8,000 market dan for Guzhen. The tax payment will be temporarily suspended in March. From April onwards, the amount of tax to be paid each month will be based on the actual sales of the previous month. If the sales in the first month are above 130,000 market dan, then 80,000 market dan of new tax will be paid in the second month, so that at least 50,000 market dan of old tax can be recovered. If the sales are below 130,000 market dan but above 110,000 market dan, at least 45,000 market dan of old tax will be recovered. If the sales are below 110,000 market dan, at least 40,000 market dan of old tax will be recovered. The new and old tax salt stored in Bengbu can be sold throughout the Anhui and Henan shores, and is not limited to the nineteen counties in northern Anhui. The deadline is until the new and old salt stored on the shore is sold to 300,000 market dan (including the salt stored on the shore, in transit, and taxed but not yet transported). During this period, no new sales locations will be opened up on the Anhui and Henan shores, and the current tax payment system will not be changed. When the new salt law is implemented in the future, the government will be responsible for guaranteeing the payment of taxes in advance, and the stored salt will be given the opportunity to be sold first. Before the taxes paid in advance for the stored salt are cleared, the salt transported to the shore according to the new salt law cannot be sold or inserted for sale in advance. When merchants acknowledge the amount, they should pay 2.15 yuan in cash per dan as a guarantee deposit. Once the procedures are completed, the government will immediately transfer the guarantee deposit originally paid by the merchant to the salt tax. This decision to invite merchants to contract will last until the end of January 1937. It is heard that the contracting merchants have recently paid the guarantee deposit to the Banpu Central Bank, and the number of sales is expected to exceed the original 400,000 market dan, which shows the enthusiasm of the merchants to contract. In the future, when the new salt arrives, it will still be sold in rotation, with half new salt and half old salt rotated for sale, in order to be fair and avoid disparity. (March 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Anqing-Hefei Road Accident; Many Deaths and Injuries; Car Overturns at Baisha Bridge in Shucheng; Postal Worker and Soldier Die Instantly <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: As of recently, the highways in Anhui Province, including those with paved roads and those with completed earthen roads open to traffic, have reached 3,279 kilometers. Except for the Nanjing-Wuhu line, which was formerly commercially operated but recently reverted to provincial operation due to losses and inability to support it, most other roads are operated by the Provincial Highway Bureau using its own vehicles. However, in terms of business, only the Wuhu-Tunxi road has a slight surplus, while the others barely cover expenses. Unexpectedly, this year, the Nanjing-Wuhu line and the Tunxi-Jingdezhen line have successively experienced tragic accidents in which cars overturned, injuring and killing passengers, and business has become increasingly depressed. Unexpectedly, another accident occurred on the Anqing-Hefei road on the 3rd, resulting in two deaths and seven or eight injuries. The road runs from Anqing through Tongcheng, Shucheng, Taoxi Town, Shangpai River to Hefei, a total length of 110 kilometers, but the road surface is only paved to Shucheng. On the morning of the 3rd, the first bus on the line from Anqing to Shucheng, Anhui Province license plate number 1667, driven by driver He Nvbing, carrying a total of more than 20 passengers, drove to the Baisha Bridge in Shucheng County. Due to the bridge crossing, the horsepower was too great, causing the speed to increase suddenly when descending the bridge. For a moment, the driver could not control it, and the brakes failed, causing it to overturn into the roadside ditch under the bridge. More than a dozen people were injured, and two seriously injured people died instantly. One was a postal worker named Shi Zhiming, 40 years old, from Huaining, who was ordered by the Provincial Postal Bureau to go to the Tianjia'an branch in Huaiyuan to serve, and he brought his wife and two children with him. The other was an unknown soldier. Afterwards, the Shucheng station reported the incident to the Anqing-Hefei Road Traffic Management Office by long-distance telephone. Director Wang hired a doctor to rush to the scene to provide assistance and sent personnel to investigate the cause of the accident, in order to report it to the Construction Department for handling the aftermath.

<p>Recently, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the eighth district of Punan. The number of bandits is numerous, mostly based in Shuike Ao (水窠為). On the evening of the 28th of last month, at 1 AM, the homes of Zhang Tongsheng and Wu Shouhe, residents of Fuxing Township, were robbed. The bandits fired shots as a warning before leaving. After receiving the report, the county government ordered Fei Gongxia, the captain of the water patrol team, to lead two patrol boats, Tang Shuqin and Shen Shousheng, to investigate and suppress the bandits. On the afternoon of the 1st, in the bamboo garden north of Mapeng, they heard suspicious voices. Fei entered to investigate and saw many people fleeing. He immediately led his team to pursue and caught one person named Zhong A'si, who confessed the names of the fleeing people. Chang Mi (常瞇) escorted Zhong to arrest Tang A'shu, and cotton yarn, cloth, scarves, and other stolen goods were found in his home. His accomplices Nie Boyun and Qi Yincai were subsequently arrested. The bandits all admitted to robbing the Zhang and Wu families in Fuxing Township. There were nineteen accomplices, with two rifles and one matchlock gun. The bandits carrying guns all fled to Shuike Ao. They also confessed to committing multiple robberies. The recovered stolen goods were identified by the victims without error. Fei then escorted Zhong A'si and the other three people and the stolen goods to Songjiang on the 4th, with a document submitted to the county government for review.</p>

<p>Regarding the general investigation of opium and drug offenders, the county government convened a meeting of district chiefs at Haishitang on the afternoon of the 4th, chaired by County Magistrate Li. It was decided that the period from March 5th to 15th would be the period of forced investigation. All those who manufacture, sell, or consume drugs, sell opium, smoke privately without a license, as well as those who intend to profit by providing opium or drug smoking in their premises, and those who use limited-term smoking cessation permits to provide smoking to others, those who relapse after compulsory detoxification, those who smuggle and help others smoke, or administer morphine for others, all the above offenders will be included in the scope of the investigation. From the 6th to the 11th, County Magistrate Li, Secretary Shen, and Section Chiefs Huang and Feng will depart for each district to convene township chiefs for training. To promote the general investigation, Guan Yaonan (District 1), Zhu Kongzhao (District 2), Le Fan (District 3), Yang Jingjiang (District 4), Chen Tigun (District 5), Hu Guanxian (District 6), Shen Jizhou (District 7), and Gu Yiru (District 8) were appointed as special commissioners, who were required to go to the countryside on the 6th and complete the report by the 15th. Those who are unable to obtain licenses for smoking will be copied and sent to each district, ordering them to be sent to the county for detoxification in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Suzhou: High Court Opens Trial of Young Mistress's Love Affair with Chauffeur <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Xi Yunqing, the wife of Liu Zirong (i.e., Madame Liu Xi), the son of Liu Huizhi, the former general manager of the Shanghai China Industrial Bank (Xi Yunqing is the daughter of Xi Ehang, a wealthy pigment merchant), had an affair with chauffeur Wu Wenxiang. Liu Zirong found out and had them arrested and sent to the Shanghai District Court. Wu Wenxiang was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. Wu Wenxiang refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyer Dong Banggan to write an appeal to the Jiangsu High Court. After the High Court accepted the case, it summoned Liu Zirong and Liu Xi, and brought Wu Wenxiang, who was in custody, to Suzhou. Yesterday (the 5th) at 10:30 AM, the criminal division judge opened the trial in the first courtroom in Zhicheng. Liu Zirong reported upon being summoned, but Liu Xi did not arrive. Wu Wenxiang hired lawyer Dong Banggan to defend him. First, Wu Wenxiang was interrogated. He testified that in July 1933, he was introduced to the Liu Zirong family to drive a car. In November of the same year, he had an affair with Liu Xi. The reason was that he often sat in the car and slept when he had nothing to do. Liu Xi would come and tell him not to sit in the car but to help in the house. At that time, she would often tell me jokes, which I ignored, intending to stop my business. One day, Liu Zirong drove out and did not return. Liu Xi came to my room, and the first act of adultery occurred. Later, she often came to my room, for more than a year now. After I left the Liu family in May of last year, I never went there again. Liu Xi rented a house in Jixiangfang after going out in July of last year and sent a letter asking me to go, saying that if I didn't go, she would commit suicide, so I went. The money used was Liu Xi's. Later, I wanted to go home, and Liu Xi said that I was ungrateful, etc. Then Liu Zirong was interrogated. He testified that he had been married to Liu Xi for four years and had a child who was three years old this year. On August 2, 1935, Liu Xi left a note and ran away, only a week after Wu Wenxiang ran away. Later, after investigating, he reported to the Public Security Bureau, who arrested them both. At this point, lawyer Dong Banggan stated that Liu Xi had not arrived today, perhaps because she had not received the summons. Liu Xi now lives at 403 Adoyar Road, Shanghai, at her brother Xi Xunde's place. He requested that she be summoned. The judge, seeing that Liu Xi had not arrived, ordered that Liu Xi and Liu Zirong's maids, A Bao and A Jin, be summoned to court again for a scheduled hearing. Liu Zirong was dismissed, and Wu Wenxiang was detained. Because the Xi family is originally from Suzhou, there were many relatives and friends in Suzhou, so many people went to the High Court to listen to the proceedings that day.</p>

The county has been ordered to comply. In addition to announcing this to all businesses, the county government has also instructed the collection personnel of the Jiaxing and Xiushui offices to be informed. If payment is not completed by the deadline, penalties will be added, and arrests and detentions will be carried out to pursue payment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee held its 24th decision-making meeting at the Bank of China National Products Building at 4:30 PM on the 4th. Committee members present included Cai Zengji, Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Zhang Peishen, Song Ziliang, Yu Zuoting, Wang Xiaolai (Yu as proxy), Chen Guangfu (Bei as proxy), etc. Chairman Cai Zengji reported on routine daily affairs. Sixty-one applications for small credit loans were submitted. After review, it was decided that one application would be approved as is, eight would be approved for half the originally requested amount, and forty-seven would have a portion of the loan amount reduced. A total of 37,950 yuan was approved for loans. Eight other applications were rejected either because the business activities did not conform to the loan principles, or because the intended use of the loan was inconsistent with the regulations. All reviewed cases will be individually notified to the applicants for their information. It was also reported that there has been a large number of requests for application forms recently. However, many applicants still overreport their capital and do not comply with the rule that loans cannot exceed half of the capital. It was decided at yesterday's meeting that any such cases in the future will be rejected without investigation. It is hoped that companies needing loans will inquire about the procedures in detail at the committee's office when requesting forms to avoid repeating errors.</p>

<p>The reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a state-run enterprise, is gradually taking shape. Special efforts are now being made to reorganize the branches. Deputy Managers Tan Boying and Lao Mian will soon depart on separate routes. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Tan Goes to the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The various ports along the Yangtze River are the richest in national products, making this area the most important for the company's shipping operations. Hankou is also a hub for both water and land transportation. Deputy Manager Tan Boying will travel to the Yangtze River area this time to reorganize the branches, assess the performance of the branch staff, and inspect the business operations along the Yangtze River to develop future strategies. He is expected to depart Shanghai within these three days, and it is said that personnel will be dispatched by the ministry to accompany him.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Special District Telephone Issue Committee - Submits Petition to the Municipal Government for Negotiation - Requests Consideration of Public Sentiment and Prompt Negotiation with the Municipal Council - To Repeal the Telephone Company's Concession Contract <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, in order to implement its opposition to price increases, specifically submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, requesting it to initiate serious negotiations with the Municipal Council, hoping to find a satisfactory solution. The original text of the petition is extracted below: The petition is for the matter of requesting consideration. Since the issue of the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase arose, the news has spread, causing widespread unrest throughout the city. Difficulties were voiced to the Municipal Council Board of Directors, requesting ways to stop it. However, the Municipal Council, based on the signed concession contract, approved its annual interest rate of one percent, disregarding the current state of Shanghai's commerce and prosperity. It is noted that telephone service is a public utility. During this time of social and economic collapse, the spirit of mutual assistance should be upheld to benefit both people and businesses, in order to seek a way of mutual existence and operation. If the hardships of commerce are ignored, relying on the contract as a shield, and exploitation is pursued as a goal, and if the city's economic recession continues unabated, and businesses cannot bear the burden, then all are bound to perish together. Since the Special District Telephone implemented the new system on March 1, limiting commercial telephones to 150 calls per month and residential telephones to 100 calls per month, the businesses in the city are groaning in agony, which is no different from putting our industry and commerce in a hopeless situation. According to the statistics of the affiliated associations, under the old system, the cost of commercial telephone usage was more than 13 yuan, with an average of 20 calls. Now, under the new system, the cost is 10 yuan, limited to 150 calls per month. For those who exceed this number, a fee of 3 cents is charged per call. Currently, there are more than 48,600 telephone subscribers in the Special District, which means a monthly loss of more than 486,000 yuan in national currency. Calculated annually, the number is shocking. The affiliated associations, entrusted by various public bodies in the city, are deeply concerned about this issue and have no solution. In addition to petitioning the central government to request evaluation and recovery for self-operation, a special petition is submitted to Your Excellency, earnestly requesting consideration of public sentiment and prompt negotiation with the Municipal Council, demanding the repeal of the Shanghai Telephone Company's concession contract, and accepting the requests of all subscribers: increasing the basic number of calls, increasing commercial telephones to 333 calls, and residential telephones to 217 calls, installing meters, stipulating a three-month trial period, and eliminating communication fees in the Chinese Concession. The above requests are truly for the benefit of the people and are hoped for by the general public. Earnestly request review and approval, and prompt negotiation with the Municipal Council, hoping to find a satisfactory solution. Then the citizens will feel the same great kindness. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Mayor of Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The City Slightly Warmer Yesterday - The Consecutive Days of Spring Cold are Rare in Forty-One Years <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Since the city became very cold on the 2nd of this month, all the ditches, tap water pipes, and inland rivers in various places remained frozen until yesterday morning. The lowest temperature was 26.1 degrees. Only after 1 PM did the thawing gradually begin, and after 2 PM, it was completely thawed. Sailing gradually resumed, and the prices of vegetables, coal, and other goods gradually stabilized. However, because the wind direction was still from the northeast, it was difficult to rise to between 40 and 50 degrees for the time being.</p>
<p>A Phenomenon Not Seen in Forty-One Years</p>
<p>A reporter from the East China News Agency learned from astronomical circles that the severe cold in the city was a record not seen in forty-one years. In 1895 (i.e., the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty), on March 16, due to all-day spring snow, the temperature suddenly dropped to a minimum of 21.6 degrees and a maximum of 32.7 degrees, and it did not thaw all day. Even eggs were frozen and cracked. Since then, there has never been such severe cold in the past forty-one years. It is also learned that the Siberian high pressure has recently been hovering at 780 millimeters, hence this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Reports No Immediate Warming</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that the recent cold weather has resulted in daily reports of deaths from freezing. According to the Shanghai Observatory, the current cold air will continue. The low pressure today is in the north and south of Okinawa and at the mouth of Wonsan, Korea. Because the low pressure south of Okinawa is moving strongly eastward, the high pressure is gradually weakening, so the low pressure is being moderated, and the cold air will not go away immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Shin Hwa and Other Factories Face Supply Shortages Due to Lack of Raw Materials <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to Central News Agency, Shin Hwa Textile Mills, including the seven mills in Shanghai, experienced debt disputes due to a shortage of working capital during last year's industrial recession. Fortunately, they were able to overcome the difficulties. Immediately afterwards, an improvement committee was formed to focus on reorganization. Now, all the spindles are gradually being replaced with new ones. The products are of high quality and sales are brisk. However, due to a lack of raw materials, they still cannot produce at full capacity. A report was recently published stating that the Bank of China was investing in the takeover, but this has been denied by the factory. The following is an examination of its recent production situation:</p>
<p>Replacing Machines to Increase Efficiency</p>
<p>Shin Hwa Textile Mills has a total of nine mills. In addition to the three mills located in Wuxi and the four mills located in Hankou, the rest are located in Shanghai. It has a total of 529,780 spindles, 43,940 yarn machines, and 4,861 looms. Since the establishment of the improvement committee last year, it has focused on reorganization and innovation, replacing new machinery and adding spinning machines, investing 1.67 million yuan to convert all machinery to the 1934 model. The organization and management of the factory are also striving for rationalization.</p>
<p>Factories Two and Five Remain Closed</p>
<p>The factory's business last year saw improved product quality and strong sales due to improvements in production methods. The daily output was 800 bales of yarn (420 pounds per bale) and 15,000 bolts of various fabrics (40 yards per bolt). However, due to the smaller cotton yield this year, which is only 70% of last year's, there is a lack of abundant raw materials for production. Therefore, factories two and five in Shanghai are currently closed. It is reported that the factory's products for April, May, and June of this year have already been completely pre-ordered and sold out.</p>
<p>Industrial Circles Hope for Assistance from All Parties</p>
<p>According to industry representatives, China's production industry is gradually progressing, but requires assistance from all parties and joint efforts. In terms of raw materials, taking raw cotton as an example, the quality of domestic production must be improved and the output must be increased by more than double. It is hoped that the government will earnestly promote and guide this point. In terms of financial assistance, in the flour milling industry, the domestic wheat production is only sufficient for four or five months of use by flour mills nationwide, so it is also necessary to promote improvement. With abundant raw materials and excellent machinery, it is hoped that the banking industry can provide convenient financial assistance. Then industrial development and the national economy can be revitalized.</p>

<p>The Shanghai branch of Wing On Tong in Singapore and the members of Huang She, along with friends of Mr. Xu, jointly hosted a farewell banquet for Mr. Xu Shiying, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Japan, at the Hua An Building on Jing'an Temple Road last night at 6 PM. The details are noted as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Wing On Tong and the members of Huang She, as Ambassador to Japan Mr. Xu Shiying is scheduled to depart for Japan tomorrow to take office, specially initiated a joint farewell banquet at the Hua An Building last night at 6 PM. Many friends of Mr. Xu participated, including Ambassador Xu, Huang Bodu, Qu Yingguang, Hu Guigeng, Zhang Shanzi, Jiang Zhongyi, Lin Zhumei, Lang Jingshan, Hu Bozhou, Chen Xiaodie, Cai Renbao, Li Dachao, Xu Muru, Zhou Zejiong, Shen Yinghui, Ma Guoliang, Shao Yuxiang, and Lin Guangmin, more than fifty people.</p>
<p>Guests and Host Made Speeches</p>
<p>After the guests and host were seated, the host Hu Guigeng stood up first to deliver a farewell speech, briefly saying that Ambassador Xu's acceptance of the new mission to Japan and his imminent departure from his colleagues made him reluctant on a personal level. He took advantage of the opportunity before the trip to jointly host a farewell banquet to wish him well on his journey. Mr. Xu has been benevolent and compassionate in the past, presiding over disaster relief efforts in various provinces, running around tirelessly for decades, which is admired by the whole country. Moreover, after years of hard work, he still used his remaining strength to build the great Mount Huang in China. The establishment of Huang She is a mechanism to assist in the construction. Under the leadership of Mr. Xu, the construction of Mount Huang has taken shape. In the future, it will be able to rival and surpass Geneva, Switzerland. All this is due to Mr. Xu's efforts. Today, I offer a cup of wine to wish the future of Sino-Japanese relations will become more friendly through the diplomatic efforts of Mr. Xu, and to wish Mr. Xu good health, etc. Then Ambassador Xu gave a speech in response and thanked everyone, briefly saying that he was grateful for everyone's support, the grand banquet and sincere encouragement. However, he was old and weak, and was not up to the task. Having received the support of the government and everyone, he would do his best to work together and strive to make the construction of Mount Huang as prosperous as possible in the future, increase national relations, and not fail his mission and everyone's expectations, which is his personal wish, etc. Until 8 PM, the guests and host dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>The Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, in order to facilitate merchants' inspection of goods classification when reporting freight, specifically compiled an easy inspection table by arranging the Ministry of Railways' sixth edition of the General Goods Classification Table in the order of the number of strokes. At the beginning of the table, there are four types of indexes: number of strokes, radical, four-corner code, and Mandarin Romanization spelling. For any goods that the Ministry of Railways has classified, the category can be found in the easy inspection table within half a minute, which is very convenient. At the end of the table, there are nine types of documents related to freight rates, such as the price list and the list of goods names, which are all complete. All merchants who report freight on the railway should have one copy for reference. This book has already been published and is available for sale at the Business Section of the Traffic Department of the Shanghai North Station, the Model Book Stall at the station, the No. 1 Business Office of the Two Railways at 407 Jing'an Temple Road, the No. 2 Business Office of the Two Railways at 18 Waima Road outside the Sixteen Pups in the Nanshi, and the Business Office of the Two Railways at 327 Zhongshi Road, Taiping Road, Nanjing.

<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee has recently issued a notification to all cotton industry organizations under the document number 統字 third six three six, stating: "Approved is a letter from the Central Cotton Adulteration and Water Mixing Elimination Office, which stated, 'Upon investigation of Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations for Eliminating Cotton Adulteration and Water Mixing, it is stipulated that if a yarn factory purchases cotton and encounters moisture content exceeding the standard but not exceeding the maximum limit, the price should be deducted accordingly. If the moisture content is below the standard, compensation should be made accordingly.' Thus, for cotton purchases, if the moisture content is between 11% and 13%, the price should indeed be deducted based on the moisture content. If the moisture content is below 11%, compensation should also be made. Currently, although various factories determine the price based on the level of moisture content when purchasing cotton, the transaction forms do not specify the deduction and compensation methods. This often leads sellers to believe that only price deductions occur, without any increases, making them unwilling to sell dry raw materials, which significantly impacts the elimination policy. It is proposed that your association notify the China Cotton Industry Joint Association, consult with the Yarn Factory Joint Association, and the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China, so that in the future, when purchasing cotton, they must indicate the moisture content in the 'Moisture Content' column on the transaction form and deduct or compensate the price according to Article 7 of the Elimination Regulations to ensure fairness and prevent excuses. Therefore, we should report this matter and respectfully request your review and compliance.'" Upon review, the method proposed by the office to indicate on the cotton purchase transaction form, in the moisture content column, "Moisture content should be deducted or compensated according to Article 7 of the Elimination Regulations," stating that yarn factories should deduct the price for cotton with moisture content exceeding the standard but not exceeding the maximum limit and compensate for cotton with moisture content below the standard, is beneficial to both buyers and sellers of cotton. It is hereby requested that you investigate, inform the industry to diligently indicate the proposed wording on the transaction forms to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Announcement by the International Trade Bureau: Reasons for Last Year's Sudden Increase in Tung Oil Sales and Five Fundamental Ways to Improve Tung Oil <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Last year, China's tung oil exports were very brisk. The market price reached a high of eighty-five yuan per picul, which was rare in recent years. However, domestic consumption decreased significantly due to the weak purchasing power of the people. In total, last year's tung oil exports amounted to 738,865 metric tons, an increase of 86,029 metric tons or 11% compared to the previous year, with a value of 41,582,879 yuan, ranking first among last year's exports and worthy of attention. The following is a record of the statistics released by the International Trade Bureau and the reasons for the sudden increase in sales:</p>
<p>Quantities Exported to Various Countries Last Year</p>
<p>Last year, the largest quantity of tung oil exports went to the United States, accounting for 60% to 70% of the total. Other countries accounted for only 30%. The United States imported 491,999 piculs, worth 28,057,248 yuan; Hong Kong 87,481 piculs, worth 4,129,109 yuan; the United Kingdom 36,551 piculs, worth 2,117,974 yuan; Germany 28,933 piculs, worth 1,787,412 yuan; France 31,154 piculs, worth 1,778,769 yuan; the Netherlands 20,607 piculs, worth 1,261,417 yuan; Denmark 7,960 piculs, worth 478,242 yuan; Japan 7,893 piculs, worth 361,867 yuan; Italy 5,382 piculs, worth 328,126 yuan; Sweden 4,340 piculs, worth 286,667 yuan; Norway 4,575 piculs, worth 277,519 yuan; Austria 3,590 piculs, worth 235,925 yuan; Belgium 2,885 piculs, worth 164,868 yuan; Argentina 1,262 piculs, worth 83,801 yuan; Kwantung Leased Territory 1,020 piculs, worth 41,787 yuan; India 541 piculs, worth 39,950 yuan; Finland 504 piculs, worth 31,785 yuan; Canada 197 piculs, worth 19,105 yuan; and other countries 1,981 piculs, worth 101,308 yuan; totaling 738,865 piculs, worth 41,582,879 yuan.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Merchants All Made Significant Profits</p>
<p>Last year, the harvests of tung seeds in Hunan, Sichuan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui were abundant, and the oil content was also very good. The market price of tung seeds was 19 yuan per picul, which was 7 yuan higher than the previous year. Each picul of tung oil required 224 catties of tung seeds, so the cost of each picul of tung oil was at least 41 yuan. Merchants engaged in tung oil exports, whether in the producing areas, Hankou, or Shanghai, made significant profits last year. However, due to the small amount of inventory, they were unable to fully supply the needs of foreign countries, so the profits they earned were not fully satisfied.</p>
<p>Three Reasons for the Sudden Increase in Sales</p>
<p>As for the reasons why tung oil trade suddenly became popular last year, there are approximately the following points: The United States is the largest market for China's tung oil, with average annual imports reaching 120 million pounds. After the economic panic, this decreased to 70 to 80 million pounds. In recent years, due to the implementation of the economic recovery plan, significant achievements have been made, and various industries have gradually recovered. The demand for tung oil has gradually returned to normal, so China's tung oil sales to the United States have also increased. After the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, there were concerns about the interruption of traffic in the Mediterranean. European countries actively stockpiled raw materials as a precaution, and tung oil, as one of the most important raw materials, experienced increased demand. China's tung oil production is scattered inland, and the transportation and sales of goods are very complicated. Once demand increases sharply, the market inventory is exhausted, and supply cannot be sustained, so prices increase accordingly. From the above, it can be seen that the main reason for the prosperity of China's tung oil exports last year was the sharp increase in overseas demand. The reason for the price increase was that last year, although China's tung oil exports were prosperous, this phenomenon was only a temporary result of supply not meeting demand, rather than China's tung oil having the ability to expand sales in overseas markets. It is difficult to regard this as a normal development.</p>
<p>Improvements Needed to Maintain Permanence</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to maintain the permanent prosperity of tung oil exports, we still need to fundamentally improve the production and sales of tung oil. The most important areas for improvement are the following five points: China's tung oil cultivation methods are extremely rudimentary. After purchasing the tung seeds, the oil presses store them at will, which inevitably leads to spoilage. The oil extraction methods are also very outdated, so the quality is poor, the color is uneven, the impurities cannot be completely removed, the oil residue is too heavy, and the acidity is too high. Moreover, because oil extraction is a manual industry, it is difficult to maintain consistent quality. China's oil extraction adheres to old methods, so the oil extraction rate is extremely low. The amount of oil lost each year across the country is astonishing. The transportation and sales procedures are extremely complicated, and some merchants mix in adulterated oil in order to seek exorbitant profits, which degrades the quality and affects foreign credibility. Although the commodity inspection bureaus of various ports have recently set qualified standards, the standards are lower than those in the United States. This should be gradually raised. The packaging and transportation methods are poor, the transportation costs are high, and there are occasional interruptions, which often prevent timely delivery, so there is a risk of supply not meeting demand in the market. Tung oil exports are entirely in the hands of foreign firms. There is no domestic organization directly engaged in tung oil exports, and oil merchants cannot coordinate with each other, so market prices are entirely controlled by foreigners.</p>
<p>The United States Cannot Currently Meet Its Own Needs</p>
<p>Tung oil is one of China's specialty products and often has a monopoly in the international market. Although the United States is also engaged in tung tree planting, it cannot currently meet its own needs. If we can seize the opportunity, quickly make improvements, and establish international credibility, then the future will be bright. The most important areas for improvement are production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales. In terms of production, we should first concentrate China's tung tree planting and provide government assistance to engage in large-scale planting. Scientific methods can be used, the variety can be unified, the output can be calculated, and production can be increased. In terms of manufacturing, new oil extraction methods should be actively adopted to increase the oil extraction rate. At the same time, attention should be paid to refining and separating the oil into grades, and establishing standards for each grade. In terms of transportation, economical packaging and transportation methods should be researched, and transportation companies should also find ways to reduce freight costs and implement responsible transportation to achieve economic efficiency and convenience. As for trade, the fundamental goal is to concentrate exports. If domestic tung oil merchants can unite and form a large-scale export organization with common strength, then China's foreign tung oil market can be gradually consolidated.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Frozen Fish Merchants Petition the Ministry of Industry: Please Maintain State-Run Fish Markets; Do Not Change the Original Intention Due to Resistance from Fishmongers; Hoping that the Fishing Industry Can Recover <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the ice-fresh fish merchants of this city, in order to request the maintenance of the state-run principle of fish markets and oppose joint government-business operations, have submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry through Xu Yifei and others from the Ice-Fresh Fish Merchants Public Welfare Association, stating: "To petition for the matter. Shanghai is a major port in the Southeast and a commercial center. The establishment of a fish market to regulate the economy and balance production and sales is indeed an essential plan to remedy shortcomings and correct abuses. All our fish merchants and fishermen are happy, believing that they can be freed from the constraints and exploitations of fishmongers, and that the suffering of manipulation and exploitation can be permanently eliminated. Therefore, we eagerly await its realization, no different from hoping for rain during a severe drought. However, recent rumors and reports in the newspapers indicate that the Ministry, because fishmongers are resistant to complying, has allowed them to remain at their original location and change to fish market brokers, and to establish a branch market at the 16th Pier, which means that fishmongers have invested 500,000 yuan, changing state-run operations to joint government-business operations. In addition to the original commissions, they are also allowed to charge an additional 1% or 2% commission from merchants or vendors to increase the revenue of the fish market. The rumors are rife. Although we dare not make presumptuous judgments, the rumors are enough to cause our merchants to be alarmed. It is said that laws should not be changed unless there are ten benefits, and systems should not be changed unless there are ten harms. The fish market as a state-run enterprise has long been determined and is known to all. If it is suddenly changed to a joint government-business operation due to the stubbornness of the fishmongers, it will not only damage the credibility of the government, but the common disease of merchants, who only seek private gain and disregard the overall situation, will become even more unscrupulous and intensify their malpractice. In the end, the people will be burdened more heavily than Mount Tong, even though the country is not yet well-governed. Furthermore, since the fishmongers themselves have reached the end of their strength, how can they have the ability to invest? It is nothing more than a stopgap measure. Thus, the disadvantages of joint government-business operations are so great and unprofitable, and the possibility of successful joint operations is so remote. Maintaining the original agreement is acceptable, but mixing government and business is unacceptable. This is one reason why merchants are alarmed by the proposed change. We were hoping that the opening of the fish market would sweep away the accumulated abuses of the past, but who knew that the old problems would not be eliminated, and the idea of adding commissions would arise again? The fishmongers are being generous at other people's expense, but the merchants are unable to afford it. It is like a flock of sparrows chirping repeatedly that it is impossible. This is another reason why merchants are alarmed by the addition of commissions. The matter concerns our vital interests, and it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we have submitted this direct report, hoping that Your Excellency will make a decisive judgment and not change the original intention of state-run operations due to the fishmongers' resistance, so that the burden can be reduced and there is hope for the revival of the fishing industry. We present this report in fear and trembling, hoping for your consideration. Respectfully submitted to Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Xu Yifei and others from the Shanghai Ice-Fresh Fish Merchants Association."</p>

<h3 id="e119">Military Medical Officer Jin Daoyi Accused of Abandonment; Defendant's Summons Unsuccessful, Trial Postponed <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Shen Ju, a local woman currently residing at No. 46 Yuru Lane, Tianhou Palace Bridge, age twenty-three, joined a song and dance troupe in 1930 and went to Beijing to perform. There, she met Jin Daoyi, a Nanjing native serving as a military medical officer. They fell in love and cohabited in the same inn. In July 1932, they officially married and later had a daughter named Qiaoguan, now six years old. Unexpectedly, starting in March 1936, Jin abandoned Shen without providing for her. Recently, Shen, through her lawyer, filed a complaint with the Special Second Court, requesting a divorce from Jin, along with alimony, stating that in July 1933, the defendant, Jin Daoyi, claimed he was going to Beiping for work and took the plaintiff and their daughter with him. However, in March of the following year, the defendant abandoned the plaintiff in a foreign land without saying goodbye. In November of that year, the plaintiff, facing starvation and cold, returned to Shanghai in distress and went to her father-in-law's house (i.e., the defendant's father) at No. 77 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, to inquire. She was met with the false claim that the defendant had never returned home, making it impossible for her to settle there. She then took her daughter and sought refuge with relatives, borrowing money to survive. In October of last year, she learned that the defendant was indeed at home and went to negotiate for support, but to no avail. His intention to abandon her was resolute, and mediation failed. She was forced to file a complaint seeking a divorce order, along with an order for the defendant to pay a lump sum of 7,200 yuan for lifelong alimony and 2,000 yuan for the daughter's education expenses. Furthermore, due to difficult living conditions and being in abject poverty, she was unable to pay the litigation fees and applied for legal aid. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, under the jurisdiction of Ma Yishu, summoned her to the seventh court. The plaintiff and her attorney explained the situation. Judge Ma, noting that the summons for the defendant, Jin Daoyi, was unsuccessful, ordered the plaintiff to supplement her application for legal aid within five days, after which another trial would be scheduled.</p>

<p>Xiao Lin Daiyu, formerly a prostitute, now redeemed, sued Zhang Shankun, the general manager of Xinhua Film Company, and Shi Dongshan, the director of the film "Song of Everlasting Regret," in the First Special District Court on criminal charges of defamation, alleging that the film depicted Xiao Lin Daiyu in a brothel with intimate scenes involving her and her patrons, which she considered insulting and damaging to her reputation. After being accused, Zhang and Shi also hired a lawyer to argue that "Xiao Lin Daiyu" was not a specific name for the plaintiff and could be used for anyone whose character and temperament resembled Lin Daiyu from the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," similar to how generous people are called "Little Mengchang" and reckless people are called "Little Zhang Fei." After two court sessions presided over by Judge Ye Shengchao of the First Special Court, where witnesses were summoned and the case was thoroughly investigated, the verdict was announced yesterday afternoon: Zhang Shankun and Shi Dongshan were found not guilty.</p>

<p>Ni Xuanqing, a Ningbo native and director of the legal department of Hui Zhong Bank, was recently criminally accused by the bank in the First Special District Court, alleging that Ni embezzled the guarantee money provided for the bank's lawsuit against delinquent clients, as well as funds received from the litigation, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. The Special First Court summoned him several times. Ni also hired lawyer Zhang Yuanmei for his defense. The case has now been concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court, acquitting Ni Xuanqing.</p>

<p>Zu Yuan, a five-year-old boy from Ningbo whose family resides at No. 27, Lane 76, Yuezhou Road, went missing while playing at the entrance of his home at 5:50 p.m. the day before yesterday. His anxious father searched for him and found Yao Baoshan, a Zhenjiang native, holding the child in his arms on an open space on Zhaofeng Road, attempting to flee. Yang stepped forward to question him. Yao claimed that the child had fallen and was pushed over by another child, and he was trying to take him home to return him to his family. Yang said that this was his son, and asked why he was lying and trying to kidnap him. Yao then abandoned the child and ran, but was caught. The patrolman from post No. 3073 arrived and took him to the Jia Yu Road police station. The child was taken back by Yang. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the situation and added that two women had recently reported to the police station that their children had been kidnapped, and requested an extension for further investigation. Subsequently, Yang Xiaochang and the Chinese patrolman reported the incident, and Yao Baoshan was questioned. His statements were evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Zhan Daosan's calligraphy shop, "Zhan Da You," located at the intersection of Fangbang Road and Guangqi Road in the city, has been an old establishment for over a hundred years. Since 1929, when the owner, Zhan Daosan, died of illness, his accumulated assets reached over 2 million yuan. Zhan Daosan had no sons, only a daughter, Feng'e, who married Cha Qilin. Regarding the issue of Daosan's estate, Daosan's younger brothers, Zhan Yunshan and Zhan Songshan, presented Daosan's adoption certificate, which stated that Yunshan's adopted son, Boqun, was to be his heir, along with a will, and they and Cha Qilin filed lawsuits against each other in the local court. The court found that the adoption certificate and will were suspected of being forged and initiated criminal proceedings, but repeated trials have not yet concluded. Details have been reported previously. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Criminal Court President Cai Dingcheng continued the trial. Zhan Yunshan and Zhan Songshan, along with witness Yu Ruizhi, appeared in court and gave their testimonies. The judge stated that the case was clear and requested Prosecutor Tang to present his arguments. The lawyers hired by the defendants, Zhang Shizhao and Zhu Fengchi, then rose to defend their clients for a long time. The judge considered the matter closed and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>

<p>Yin Sunshi, a thirty-year-old native of Yangzhou, residing at No. 30, Rongqing Lane, Roberts Road, West Shanghai, adopted Luo Ying, the eleven-year-old daughter of Zhu Zhengshi, a woman from Pudong, some years ago.

Gu Wentao, the precinct officer of the sub-station, ordered the police to arrest Xu. Xu claimed that Yin Sunshi had cut her face with a kitchen knife and falsely accused him.

<p>Shen Jia Zhang, a local resident who runs Da Zhong Paper Store and lives with several brothers at No. 10, Bei Wang Yi Ma Lane in the city, was suddenly visited by five or six robbers at 6:00 PM last night. Three robbers held guns and threatened Shen's wives, mothers, and daughters to remain silent and confined them to a room. They then began searching the bedrooms upstairs and downstairs, and no one, including Shen's mother, was spared. After an hour of robbery, all cash and jewelry were taken, but clothing was left scattered on the floor. Even a grey squirrel fur coat was left behind. At that time, neighbors, surprised by the unusual lack of activity at the Shen residence, informed patrol officers Qi Bin and Hu Chongmin of the Chenxiangge Police Station, who were passing by on official business and learned of the situation. Recognizing that a robbery was in progress, they bravely charged in with guns. The robbers were already fleeing, but fearing being outnumbered, Qi and others fired two shots into the air as a warning. They then intercepted and arrested a suspected robber at the door and seized a fake pistol. Unbeknownst to them, the robbers inside had already escaped. They subsequently intercepted and arrested two more suspected robbers at the door. All were taken to the police station. According to the victim, Shen Jia Zhang, who was not at home, the value of the stolen items would be determined after an inventory. The confessed robber, Lin Weisheng, a twenty-two-year-old native of Shandong, admitted to participating in the robbery. The other suspects, Ji Shutang, fifty-six years old, a native of Hubei, and Tong Youen, thirty-four years old, a native of Anhui, denied involvement. In addition to immediately pursuing the escaped robbers, the authorities have also telegraphed headquarters for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Second Rent Reduction on Tianshujiao Street, MinGuo Road: Second Special Court Rules for 20% Reduction <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>From 265 yuan to 169.6 yuan. Several dozen businesses on Tianshujiao Street, MinGuo Road, in Shanghai, including Zhenhexiang Hardware Store, Guanghua Socks Factory, Yuehua Teahouse, Rongkang Electrical Supplies Store, Beiyang Barber Shop, Renchang Company, Hongyunlou Restaurant, Hansheng Company, Tongmaozhan, Hengfeng Money Exchange, Yongtaixiang, Tekang Liquor Store, and Dexing Restaurant, joined the Rent Reduction Association in 1934 and formed the Tianshujiao Street Branch to negotiate rent reduction with the landlords. In April of the same year, they reached a settlement to reduce the rent by 20%. Now, due to the deteriorating economic situation, the tenants requested a further reduction of 30%, but the landlord filed a lawsuit demanding that they vacate the premises. The tenants appealed to the Rent Reduction Association for assistance, and the association decided to file a counterclaim, entrusting the Southern District Rent Reduction Association to handle the matter. The judgment of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court, Case No. 801 of 1935, is recorded below. The plaintiff, Heji Company's Xu Xiulu, stated that he sought a judgment ordering the defendant, Mao Lihua, to pay 1,272 yuan in rent and, if his property was insufficient to pay, that the guarantor, Zhou Zhenqing, would pay on his behalf, and also ordering the defendant to vacate the premises and bear the litigation costs, and dismissing the counterclaim. The main points of his statement were that the defendant, Mao Lihua, rented houses No. 246 and 247, MinGuo Road, from the plaintiff at a monthly rent of 212 yuan, guaranteed by Zhou Zhenqing. From August of last year to January of this year, he owed a total of six months' rent, totaling 1,272 yuan in national currency. Despite repeated reminders, he evaded payment. As for the counterclaim, the rent had already been reduced and there was a signed agreement, so there could be no further reduction and it should be dismissed. He submitted six rent receipts, one contract, one draft reminder letter, and one rent reduction agreement as evidence. The defendant, Zhenhexiang, appointed Shen Xinfu of the Southern District Rent Reduction Association as his agent, seeking a judgment dismissing the plaintiff's claim and filing a counterclaim. His defense and statement were: "It is true that the rent is owed, but it is due to the rent reduction. Money has been deposited in the bank, the rent is too high. Although it was reduced by 20% in 1934, many of the surrounding merchants still cannot survive. According to the current trend of declining property prices and land values, we now request that the rent be calculated at 70% of 212 yuan and order the defendant to pay rent accordingly." Reason: Regarding the main suit, the plaintiff requested that the defendant Mao Lihua vacate the premises because he owed six months' rent and had been sent a reminder letter. The plaintiff's reminder letter only demanded that the defendant Mao Lihua pay the full amount of rent owed within five days, which can hardly be considered as setting a reasonable deadline. It is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 440 of the Civil Code, and it is difficult to order the defendant to terminate the contract and vacate the premises. Regarding the rent owed, the defendant Mao Lihua should pay a certain amount, and the guarantor Zhou Zhenqing should bear the guarantee responsibility. The defendant's counterclaim should be examined first. Although the rent reduction agreement signed by the plaintiff on April 13, 1934, stipulated that the defendant Mao Lihua's rent would be reduced from 265 yuan to 212 yuan per month from January 1934 to 1939, there was no restriction preventing further rent reductions in the future. If the value of the rented property has declined, the tenant is entitled to claim a reduction in rent. It is now found that the value of real estate in this city has generally declined, which is a significant fact. The court, considering the circumstances and in accordance with the provisions of Article 442 of the Civil Code, believes that it should be reduced by 20%. It should be ruled that the rent of 1,272 yuan for six months should be reduced to 1,017.6 yuan, and the rent from February of this year should also be calculated at 80%, etc.</p>

<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the case of a foreign man and woman in Room 222 of the New Asia Hotel on Tuesday, who overdosed on sleeping pills and were in critical condition, has become clearer after further investigation by the police and the American authorities. It is reported that the three are currently in two different hospitals. After treatment, all are out of danger. The man is a corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China, named Fang Taien. The two women are both Russian. One of them checked into a room at the hotel on Saturday morning. Three days later, on Tuesday morning, another woman joined them. At 5:30 PM that day, the waiter knocked on the door, following instructions, but received no response. He reported to the manager, and as the door was locked, they forced it open. Inside, they found a man and two women lying unconscious on the same bed. Several empty bottles of sleeping pills were nearby. The police were immediately notified and sent ambulances to the hospital. It is reported that letters in English and Russian were left in the room. It is believed that the letters contain clues to the case. Judging from the case, the man and two women took a large dose of sleeping pills, intending to commit suicide together. Once the three have recovered slightly and can be questioned, they will be interrogated. Yesterday, the condition of the three remained semi-conscious. Captain Pengen of the intelligence service is currently in charge of investigating the corporal.</p>

It is reported that the two Russian women are both young and beautiful. One is eighteen years old, living on Hualong Road, and the other is twenty-three years old, living on Luban Road, and both work as dancers. It is reported that they took anesthetic poison, not sleeping pills. The U.S. Marine Corps seems unwilling to disclose anything about this strange case.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Summary of the Public Concession Health Department's Budget for the Year <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Health Department's budget for this year has been drafted, reviewed and approved by the Health Committee, and submitted to the Finance Department and the Health Department for review. The main points are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Expenditure: Under the item of temporary expenditure, land and property, the original plan to purchase land in various locations for the construction of small vegetable markets, etc., has been temporarily suspended this year. However, the purchase of one and nine-tenths of a mu of land for the pig slaughterhouse on Pingliang Road, at a cost of 22,000 yuan, cannot be delayed any longer this year. In terms of housing, the remaining construction costs for the Zhaojin Road slaughterhouse of 24,500 yuan must be paid this year. The livestock feeding station urgently needs expansion this year, costing 7,000 yuan, which has also been included in the budget. In addition, there is a remaining construction cost of 9,400 yuan for the meat market cold storage, and 14,000 yuan for additional machinery and equipment, which have also been included as urgent items. Furthermore, the plans for the rooftop project and internal machinery and equipment of the slaughterhouse have been drawn up, with a total cost of 150,000 yuan, which has also been approved and included in the budget. In addition, there is a remaining construction cost of 27,000 yuan for the animal carcass disposal site, and 11,000 yuan for internal equipment, which are also pending payment and therefore included as urgent items. The hospital expenses included in the budget's temporary expenditures include 3,500 yuan for cold storage equipment at the Industrial Bureau's Isolation Hospital, as the original equipment is beyond repair and new equipment must be added. The expansion costs of the Tuberculosis Sanatorium are 8,000 yuan. According to the opinion of the head of the Public Works Department, the existing buildings of the sanatorium have many structural defects and should not be expanded further. However, in view of the current financial situation, it is not possible to purchase land and build new buildings. The number of patients with lung disease awaiting treatment is overwhelming, so the only option is to temporarily expand the sanatorium, which is expected to accommodate 50 more patients. The remaining housing costs of 6,000 yuan for the hospital laundry, and 17,000 yuan for machinery and equipment, have also been included as urgent items. In addition, the construction projects that have been temporarily suspended include the Mental Hospital and the Western District Fever Hospital, the latter of which is rumored to cost around 800,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Recurrent expenditure: The total amount of recurrent expenditure originally planned by the department, excluding inventory donations, subsidies, etc., listed separately, was 1,607,760 yuan, a decrease of more than 48,000 yuan compared to last year. However, the above figure is calculated based on an exchange rate of 1 shilling and 6 pence in gold per yuan in national currency. If calculated at 1 shilling and 2 and three-eighths pence, the above number would rise to 1,696,540 yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan compared to last year. Subsequently, the number was reduced by the head of the Health Department to 1,624,070 yuan, a decrease of 32,510 yuan, or slightly less than 2%, compared to last year. A comparison of various expenses with last year shows slight increases in the "General" section of the General Affairs Department, the Pathology Laboratory, the Pharmacy, and the Cemetery, as well as the "Hospital" section of the Mental Hospital, the Chinese Isolation Hospital, the Tuberculosis Sanatorium, and the Nurses' Dormitory. There are fewer in the "General" section of the Chemical Laboratory, Cleaning, Milk, Markets, Food Inspection, and the "Hospital" section of the Management Department, the Isolation Hospital, and the Moganshan Sanatorium. In terms of personnel, only necessary minor changes have been included in this year's budget. In addition, there is 24,250 yuan under the inventory supplies item, totaling 1,648,320 yuan in recurrent expenditure, a decrease of 53,210 yuan compared to last year's 1,701,530 yuan.</p>

<p>Jinfa and Mianyuan, located on the second and third floors of No. 16 Yong'an Street, French Concession, specialize in import and export business. Suddenly, at midnight between 3 and 4 a.m. on January 14, someone sneaked in from the vacant house next door at No. 14 and stole all 33 account books belonging to Jinfa and Mianyuan. The victims reported the incident to the police for investigation. On the 27th of last month, Wei Daosheng, a bookkeeper at Jinfa (22 years old, from Fujian), surrendered to the police, claiming that he had stolen the account books and hid them in the Dafang Hotel and the Lequn Inn. Detective Hang Guangfu was dispatched and retrieved 24 account books from the two inns. There were still nine books missing. Wei was then sent to the Second Special Court, and the hearing was rescheduled. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian questioned him again in the First Court. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case and said that the defendant had committed the crimes of embezzlement and theft, and requested a trial. Then, Wu Zehong, manager of Jinfa, said that the defendant, Wei Daosheng, was the merchant's brother-in-law. He was recommended as an apprentice at the age of 15, and his conduct was usually very good. Therefore, he was promoted to the position of bookkeeper last year. He was very honest in the store, eating simple meals and wearing plain clothes. Therefore, the merchant trusted him very much. He did not know that he was secretly engaging in fraud. The defendant was afraid that he would be discovered when the accounts were settled at the end of the year, so he designed to steal the account books so that the merchant could not check the accounts. After the theft, the merchant did not suspect him at first. Later, when the silver in the account box suddenly went missing, he questioned him, but he only blushed and remained silent. Then, he left on a pretext and never returned, which aroused suspicion and led to a police investigation. It is now estimated that Wei embezzled more than 3,300 yuan. Sheng Jiepu, bookkeeper of Mianyuan, said that four of the merchant's stolen account books are still missing. Detective Hang Guangfu said that after the police received the plaintiff's report, detectives were dispatched to investigate. Later, according to reports, the defendant was often seen in Room 202 of the Kaitelin Apartment in Hongkou. When the police went to arrest him, Wei was gone, and only a few torn account books and a leather suitcase were found, containing brand new suits and leather shoes, which were purchased with the embezzled money. These clothes were worn to dance halls. On the 27th, the defendant surrendered to the police and confessed the location where the account books were hidden, so the police went to retrieve them. Wei Daosheng confessed to embezzlement and theft, but said that the money he obtained was used for bidding, speculation, and dance halls. He was deceived by others. According to the accountant's calculation, he only embezzled more than 1,000 yuan, not 3,300 yuan. Later, he felt guilty and surrendered to the police. Judge Li announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 11th.</p>

<p>Wang Ruchun from Suzhou, who lived at No. 151 Meiyi Lane, Shanhai Road, used to work as an old clerk in a bank on Henan Road. Since the opening of the New World Company on Nanjing Road, Wang has been spreading rumors that the rooftop amusement park of the New World Company will soon be opened. If anyone needs to manage the toilet or set up a food stall, he can help them, but they need to pay a deposit. Zhang A'er of Shengtai Iron Shop on North Xizang Road paid Wang 45 yuan, Zhang Xiaomao of No. 277 North Xizang Road paid 135 yuan, Chen Xushi of No. 2 Zhixing Lane, Dongxinqiao Street paid 75 yuan, Yu Zhongkang of No. 660 Gordon Road paid 105 yuan, and Gao Xushi of No. 1 Deming Lane, Baire Road paid 20 yuan. Recently, the victims discovered Wang's deception and reported it to the Huishi Police Station. Chinese detective Sun Changsheng arrested Wang at the Ningshang Inn on Tianjin Road the day before yesterday and sent him to the Criminal Court No. 5 of the First Special Court yesterday morning.

<h3 id="e143">Measures for the Transportation and Sale of Medical Supplies, Sulfur, etc.; Circular from the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The National New Pharmaceutical Industry Federation yesterday sent a letter to the new pharmaceutical industry associations in various provinces and cities, stating that sulfur sublimate, potassium chlorate, potassium nitrate, and other items are widely used in medicine. Therefore, the first session of the Members' Representative Conference of the Federation resolved to submit a request to the competent authorities to formulate measures for the small-scale transportation and sale of medical supplies to facilitate business operations. Separate written requests have been submitted on file. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Salt and Sulfur Bureau issued Instruction No. 572 in the Su character of February 19th of this year, stating that the Ministry of Finance issued Instruction No. 2142 in the Salt character of December 30th of last year, forwarding the original document submitted by the association requesting the formulation of separate measures for the transportation and sale of sulfur and other items required for medical use. It is currently under review. In addition, the Ministry of Finance issued Instruction No. 22223 of January 31st of this year, approving the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's response to the same request from the association, ordering immediate investigation and reply for verification. Upon receiving this, it was determined that the nitrates and sulfur used in medicines were originally one of the supplies that should be within the scope of the transportation and sales department. However, if sulfur, potassium chlorate, and other items are used for medical purposes and are required to be of pure quality, which the transportation and sales department does not have, each drug dealer should still be allowed to file a record or apply for a passport as a special case for self-purchase and transportation. This has been handled for many years without any inconvenience. In the future, if the association needs to purchase and transport, it should first prepare documents according to the regulations, stating the annual quantity required by each drug dealer, and submit them to the bureau for verification.

<p>(An Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, Part 16) Monthly Comparison Table of Shanghai Real Estate Transactions in the 24th Year (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>January 1,858,000</p>
<p>February 667,600</p>

<p>November 4,041,000</p>
<p>December 2,939,900</p>
<p>The reason why the new legal tender can save the decline of Shanghai's real estate is mainly because the chips are looser than before, and real estate mortgages are easier to turn around; in addition, there are two points that have nothing to do with the new legal tender, but have a great impact on real estate. The first is that the Legislative Yuan is striving to improve and make effective the liquidation law for real estate mortgages, and the second is that the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly ordered the China Construction Bank to organize a real estate mortgage bank, all of which can make people feel excited. Therefore, its future may have considerable hope.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding Shanghai's real estate, there is a new trend that we must pay attention to, that is, real estate transactions are biased towards the French Concession and the western district of the Public Concession, and new houses are mostly foreign residences. According to the results of the investigation and statistics, a comparison table can be listed as follows:</p>

<p>The Western Youth Eight-Team Volleyball League has been going on for five weeks since it started. The first cycle is coming to an end, with only the two games of Haiqing vs. Xiqing and Zhongqing vs. McLaughlin remaining tonight. However, Zhongqing decided to withdraw due to referee errors during the game with Haiqing. The game with Xiqing last week was not attended, which is a pity for this year's volleyball tournament. Therefore, there is only one game tonight, Haiqing vs. Xiqing, which will start at 7:15. Since its debut, Haiqing has won repeatedly, with great strength. The Russian army, with its powerful force, and Zhongqing, with its many strong players, have both been defeated by the team. Therefore, they have high hopes for this year's championship. Xiqing's technology is average and has been defeated by the Russian army. Meeting Haiqing tonight, although both the location and the people are favorable, it is feared that it will still be a one-sided situation and that it will not be able to withstand Haiqing's attack. Tomorrow, there will be one game each in the first and second divisions of Group B, starting at 3:30 PM. The recent situation of Group A and the schedule for today and tomorrow are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Group A Situation</p>

<p>The volleyball team organized by the members of the Central Youth Association has participated in the Western Youth Volleyball League in previous years, winning every game and repeatedly winning championships. All the team members are national players or athletes of the Games, so their skills are unparalleled. Unfortunately, this year, they repeated their participation in the Western Youth League. Because most of the team members usually pay attention to basketball, they lack practice in volleyball and have unfamiliar cooperation. Since the start of the Western Youth League, they have lost to the Russian army in the first game and were defeated by Haiqing in the second game. When the team played against Haiqing, the referee, Plata, made unfair judgments and reversed his decisions, which was considered unsatisfactory. At that time, they obeyed the rules of the referee and did not argue. However, the next day, they sent a written letter to the Chairman of the Sports Committee of the Western Youth to protest. Unexpectedly, there was no satisfactory answer, but only perfunctory excuses. Therefore, in the game against Haiqing on the 2nd of this month, they painfully gave up the game, and the Western Youth still showed no response. Therefore, the members of the Central Youth team became more indignant and believed that they could not continue to cooperate, so they decided to withdraw from this year's volleyball tournament.</p>

<p>"Those bears?" Robert asked with interest.</p>
<p>"No, it refers to those 'Pilgrims' because the Indians often made things difficult for them. They didn't have enough food to eat, and they had to carry guns on the way to church. Many people died. Later, they simply moved from the ship and landed on a large stone called 'Plymouth Rock' (Note 4), which Aunt Shu also saw and touched. These people later subdued the Indians and gradually became rich. They are all very good; one of my distant ancestors also came from those ships. One of the ships was called Mayflower (Note 5). They created Thanksgiving, which we have often had since, and I love this festival very much. Please give me some more turkey."</p>
<p>"I think Xiao Qiao will become a historian in the future. He narrates those facts so clearly," Uncle Fulizi's eyes turned towards Aunt Shu, filled with smiles. At the same time, he gave some more turkey to the descendants of those early settlers.</p>
<p>"I thought a person could eat as much as they wanted on Thanksgiving. But Fulang just said that you shouldn't eat too much even at this time," said Tai Fei with a somewhat uneasy look on his face, probably because he had received some warning.</p>
<p>"Fulang is right, so be careful with your knife again. Don't eat too much, otherwise, you won't be able to join in doing that unexpected thing later," said Mrs. Shu.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a significant decrease in trading. The morning session was the quietest. There were only ten bid prices for the five types of unified public bonds. Each round took only fifteen minutes to complete. People were idle and mostly watching. Those who were short were afraid of causing a price increase and temporarily watched, while those who were long felt that the market price was still high and the profit was not suitable. They held each other back, leading to a quiet market. The market price gradually declined in each round, because the market price was not small and could not attract investment. Without investment, there was nothing for speculation to rely on. The trend may slightly decline, and it is difficult to expect a prosperous trading volume for a while.</p>
<p>Yesterday's process: The opening was stable but weak, slightly rebounding by two or three jiao. The final settlement of Class B was completely without any transactions. Classes E and D also had only one market price each, which was one or two jiao smaller than the opening. In the afternoon, there were more transactions, with No. 11 slightly sold and No. 35 bought more. The market price fell by another 1.5 to 4.5 jiao.

Changfeng absorbed a large amount, and the momentum was good. As a result, all months rose by 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price.

<p>(Hankou Correspondence) The sales of cotton in Hankou are becoming more active, and the situation is thriving. Because the cotton bale market in Shanghai is rising, it is profitable for exporters to purchase, so they are purchasing in large quantities. At the same time, the spring sales of cotton yarn there are developing, and the absorption by yarn mills is also strong. The total transaction for the day was 7,217 dan and 20 jin converted to market weight, with a total value of over 230,000 yuan. The highest market price was 37 yuan, and the lowest was 33.8 yuan, an increase of 0.3 to 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's market price. The trading situation is excerpted below.</p>
<p>Producing Area, Market Price per Jin, Transaction Volume</p>
<p>Fan Di Cotton, 36.70, 40 pieces</p>
<p>Ma Kou Cotton, 34.15, 110 bales</p>
<p>Sui Zhou Cotton, 35.50, 120 bales</p>
<p>Que Shan Cotton, 37.00, 122 pieces</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market had its own market conditions. It was initially firm but then fell. Foreign wheat quotations had differences of about 0.1 yuan. The opening price for this month was initially 0.35 yuan, but then the factory sold to the near term due to slow spot sales, leading to weakness in the following rounds. Near and far term prices fell by 0.01 yuan compared to the initial opening. When the afternoon market opened, transactions turned quiet, and the market also trended sideways. Because the weather was cold but there was no rain, people's sentiment mostly eased. In the future, the near term will depend on sales, and the far term will depend on the weather.</p>
<h3 id="e193">No Transactions in March-April Wheat <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, but there were no transactions in March. In June, there was external interest pulling it up, showing a good 0.03 yuan in the morning and afternoon. Transactions were not smooth in July and August and below, and the market price was slightly lower. The wheat market situation is currently lacking in change. It must wait for the weather to improve and the new wheat to be harvested, but only substantial purchases can make it prosper. The spot wheat market is still smooth, and the price is stable. Kaiguan Dian wheat is 5.223 yuan, Yaowan Shandong wheat is 5.23 yuan, Danyang Daqiao wheat is 5.22 yuan, Tiantai wheat is 5.19 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat is 5.22 yuan, totaling 2,500 bags, which were processed by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat has less deliverable goods, and Canadian wheat exports are increasing. Other than for the industry, demand is extremely weak.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Early Rice is Thriving Due to Northern Sales, Local Street Sales Turn Dull <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various merchants totaled over 30 shops (totaling over 7,000 shi), of which early rice accounted for the majority. Fortunately, with the backing of Qingdao and other merchants handling over 3,000 bags, the early rice market tended to stabilize. Due to the slow sales of thick early japonica rice in this street, the market price had no significant gains or losses. Du Yang pointed rice was flat with slight tightness, and Yin Yuan was similar.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Recently, prices in various producing areas in the interior have been expensive, with a difference of several jiao compared to Shanghai. Therefore, few sources arrived from the river in the past few days, causing the prices of various rice markets to gradually rise. Yesterday, about 40 boats arrived from the river, and the market for various goods turned dull. The price of white japonica rice was high and stable, the price of medium quality was close to the corner. Early rice also rebounded by a small amount of fen. Early rice sales are still quite good, and the price is firm. Yin Yuan sales are active, and the price is strong. Ke Jian sales are not smooth, and the price is stable. The remaining goods are showing signs of weakness.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market saw some arrivals from Jiujiang and Hankou, but the cargo owners were reluctant to sell easily due to high costs. However, local street sales were still active, with both the interior and Quanzhou responding well. Warehousing households were readily processing, and the market suddenly became tight. Dealers who had bought and stored were unwilling to sell, and cargo owners were even more adamant, so the market immediately rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. A total of 4,143 bags of Gan rice, 940 bags of Xiang rice, 450 bags of Han rice, 500 bags of Wintai rice, and 600 bags of Siamese No. 3 rice were opened. The price was similar to the previous market, but the goods were more decisive, and the costs were also close to the corner.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was firm due to continued tightness in tariffs. The association's marked price for No. 24 coarse granulated white spot was 22.25 yuan, and the quantity available from the supplier was scarce. Re-export goods were 7.1 yuan. East Red (MS) sugar was 15.8 yuan, and the NKC mark was 6.7 yuan, unchanged. East White No. 8 spot was 21.9 yuan, and re-export was 6.9 yuan, both up by 0.05 yuan. No. 9 YRO mark was 21.65 yuan, up by 0.1 yuan, and re-export was 6.55 yuan. Mianbai No. 1 from this factory's Zhenji was 20.9 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were unchanged. There were over 100 bags of Zhiyang opened by Chao merchants, with higher prices at 14.1 to 14.2 yuan, ordinary at 13.7 to 13.8 yuan, and turned red opened at 13 yuan to 12.5 to 12.6 yuan. High Huanggang Green was 10.3 yuan, and Longgang Green was 9.2 yuan. A total of about 200 pieces were traded. (Yesterday's report mistakenly printed the number of white bags opened as ten thousand bags, which has been corrected by the joint bank).</p>

<p>Recently, the Southern gorgon fruit market in Xinghua has seen a sharp drop due to a certain customer selling cheaply in the sales area, shaking the market. The price has fallen by nearly 10 yuan before and after, so the selling price in Shanghai also fell. According to observers in the industry, there is a tendency for further loosening. Ordinary pond gorgon has not risen or fallen much, called 18 yuan. Good cleaned goods are also slightly looser, called 21-22 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Woolen Fabrics Public Welfare Association had a good atmosphere. Various types of main road suits and other goods had both retail and wholesale transactions. West goods saw a large decrease in transactions compared to before due to the impact of cheap Japanese goods dumping. However, recently Japanese goods have also become more expensive due to the sharp rise in drafts and tariffs, so the sales of Yihua and other goods woven in Shanghai have suddenly increased. As a result, it is rumored that Japanese trading companies such as Mitsui and Yoshida will establish factories in Shanghai to weave woolen fabrics, hoping to defeat Yihua's products. According to detailed investigations by reporters, Japanese trading companies do have this plan, and sooner or later they will establish factories in Shanghai for weaving.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Thursday was the date for Yuanfang to call at the village. 50 boxes of various goods were arranged. Due to the cold weather and sluggish sales, the price of goods fell further. Taixi satin prices were still stable, one yuan velvet had no rise or fall, Yuanzhi wool and Yuanfu silk fluctuated slightly, and feather silk piece prices fell by several jiao to one yuan. However, the Shangshan map only fell by 0.2 yuan, and red and blue foreign cloth were sold at a fixed weekly price. Foreign yarn also fell, and the cloth sold in season as the weather was cold.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Mason <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>Three miles from the city, a small path along the fields led into the countryside. There were no cars or horses, only farmers walking back and forth barefoot, carrying their vegetables, small bundles of firewood, and hay on their shoulders, sometimes with their small children. With cigarettes in their mouths, they displayed an air of peace, strength, and an inscrutable cunning. "Canada Dyeing and Cleaning Factory"—this was a flamboyant name. Surrounded by bamboo fences in front of us, a black painted sign with these words in white oil paint. Opposite, there was a low hill covered with various styles of tombs.</p>
<p>Standing in the shallow, clear creek, about twenty of us were working about twenty or thirty feet west of the path. Mason's position was closest to me on the left. We took the boiled clothes out of the soda pot, lightly dipped them in water, and swung them into the air, forcefully hitting them on the stone slab... repeating this process, then pressing down with our full body weight to wring out the dirt. The foam splashed into the stream, turning it milky white and muddy.</p>
<p>We hadn't even finished smoking a cigarette when the company's food delivery truck honked its horn on the highway far to the east—it had become a habit. But that day, because the regular driver's wife was sick and a novice was filling in, we were exceptionally granted a very pleasant fifteen-minute break.</p>
<p>Mason and I found a clean grave site on the opposite low hill, and we lay on the gray sandy ground, stretching our bodies as much as possible. The gray sand was warm, like a hard baking sheet on a stove, and the winter sun covered us with a soft, comfortable warmth.</p>
<p>"This sky... is the same one above our heads every day. Do you believe it?"</p>
<p>He started by looking incredulous. "Do you often pay attention to it?" Having said that, he opened his eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>And then he slowly added, "It's very cold to me."</p>
<p>Our surroundings were quiet and beautiful. A gentle breeze swayed through the new pine forest, rustling gently back and forth above us. The yellow weeds stubbornly crawled on the ground, as if they were fully drawn springs, exerting all their strength to resist the insidious suction of the soil. ... Not a single bird was seen. Only army ants, small beetles, and grasshoppers quietly busied themselves on the dry hillside. ...</p>
<p>The sky was filled with bright colors that one wouldn't expect in winter—light purple and light blue, like a wild lake that hasn't been trampled by vulgar, frivolous, and self-important tourists, with fragments of lotus flowers floating on it. Its orange-red, huge single eye—a huge, incomparably large, cannon-like eye—flashed with golden light.</p>
<p>Two parallel cloud rifts cut straight across half the sky, inserting themselves into the sun's halo, just like vehicle tracks. I felt that the tomb we were lying on had begun to shake and was traveling swiftly along those tracks. Mason nudged my ribs with his elbow.</p>
<p>"I say our shop has become a company of the vanquished."</p>
<p>The way he said that made me happy. "Company of the vanquished" was a flavorful term created by the people of Guangzhou more than a decade ago. At that time, three major companies had been cursed for exclusively selling inferior goods. ... I knew that Mason's judgment referred to our "Canada" company accepting a batch of dyes. This batch of dyes was shipped in by a merchant from Shanghai named Wu Lifu, who called his goods "sacrifices."</p>
<p>I didn't answer him. I asked him something else.</p>
<p>"...Later, what else did that Shanghainese say, that egg sac!—Every time he comes to the provincial capital, he curses the people he meets in Shanghai; last time it was his uncle, the time before that, it was his mistress..."</p>
<p>"If you listen to him, the students in Shanghai are wrong," Mason pointed out to me. "They declare that only they are qualified to be patriotic, and no one else is allowed. ... Wu Lifu enthusiastically described how frivolous, arrogant, and dismissive those students were of other people's patriotic actions... He said that once, a blacksmith shouted loudly at a large group of students, and the young people actually attacked him, beating him half to death. ... In Shanghai, everyone laughs when you mention the students..."</p>
<p>"They're not as smart as we are here. 'Staff and Workers'—we're right. ..."</p>
<p>"It's not worth letting that Shanghainese chew on it."</p>
<p>"That's right. But damn it, — does he even know what's right and wrong..."</p>
<p>We fell silent. Mason was depressed. One of his arms was bent on the ground, pressing down on his own hand.</p>
<p>The sky underwent an even more beautiful transformation. The cloud rifts split into more streaks, the tracks disappeared—that one-eyed, enormous head was covered with strands of hair, hanging all the way to the edge of the sky. Crimson fragments merged into large blocks of various shapes, as if they were about to sink down.</p>
<p>"Are you worried about that Shanghainese?"</p>
<p>"Shanghainese, no. When I want to do something, I don't care about anyone," Mason said. "I'm unhappy because of my mother-in-law. ... She forces me because of money... She deceives me because of money... She mocks me because of money. I beat her hard this morning. ..."</p>
<p>Mason and I later burst out laughing.</p>
<p>We needed to laugh. We needed this brief and precious rest—for our endless work, hardship, poverty, and the inescapable depression that only eroded our strength.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Zola's Writing Method <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Hannian</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century, the writing method of naturalistic novels, through the hands of Balzac, and then Flaubert, and finally Zola, reached its perfection.</p>
<p>Zola said that he himself could not create a plot. He believed that a person is a product of environment and heredity, so he always started writing novels by researching these two aspects. He once said to a friend:</p>
<p>"When I start writing a novel, I am not troubled by the plot. I have no idea where to insert the story, which characters will appear in which places, or how the story will begin and end."</p>
<p>In order to research a character, he always collects all kinds of documents that can help him. He has three research paths: first, historical books; second, written or oral evidence; and finally, he personally goes to the scene of the incident to observe.</p>
<p>He said: "Every time I write a novel, I am always surrounded by books on the subject; I always find many experts to talk to me; I also have to travel myself to see the place, the people, and the morality of the place."</p>
<p>He takes notes during his travels. He records the appearance of the characters, the scenery, and fragments of conversations.</p>
<p>He then classifies and organizes the documents he has collected, binds them into volumes, and puts them in beautiful book covers. He calls this first step "the organization of book covers."</p>
<p>We can see that Zola is like a respectable and erudite scholar in the first step of his work. He has been immersed in research, collecting materials, but now he is going to move on to the second stage: the stage of imagination.</p>
<p>He now begins to sketch. He thinks where he goes, and writes where he goes, without talking about art or rhetoric. In this way, he writes the outline of the novel. He then revises the outline again and again, making it specific from the general. In terms of characters, he first divides them into classes, and then pulls out the individual from the class. After such step-by-step sketching, a series of events naturally emerge around these characters.</p>
<p>After he has a full understanding of the plot, he begins to deal with the characters. He records all the past behaviors of the character: career, age, health, physique, temperament, habits, social relations, etc., without missing anything, like a judge interrogating a criminal. In this way, the behavior of the protagonist in his novel is determined.</p>
<p>At this time, his book covers gradually swell, and his work requires more precise selection. Sometimes, the novel he writes is only two volumes, but the book covers containing the materials of the novel are three or four times larger than the novel.</p>
<p>Once the materials are collected, he starts to deal with the structure of the whole book chapter by chapter. He himself said: "I work step by step, I embellish my sketches, and put all the important facts in the appropriate place. The same is true for the placement of characters: here is a description of the physical form, there is a description of the prominent personality; further, the psychological state of the protagonist that I want to suggest is selected. I overturn each book cover, and everything necessary is placed in its proper place; the scene of the incident, the houses, the scenery... must all be distributed and interspersed harmoniously according to the plot of the story. Now I have already outlined the rough lines of the structure. But this is still rough. The events contained in each chapter are randomly inserted when I pour out my book covers. Therefore, before I start real writing, I have to determine a "fixed plan" from the "original" plan and the pile of materials, separating and linking them chapter by chapter, completely following the sequence of the action's progress. At this time, it is just like before a drama is staged, all the materials for the performance are prepared."</p>
<p>This is the time to open the curtain. This is the most pleasant part of his work, and it is also the final step in his writing: carefully polishing and transcribing.</p>
<p>He quietly and regularly revises and transcribes. He writes four manuscript pages a day, neatly and almost without any corrections. After writing, he puts them aside and never looks at them again before publishing. Yes, he doesn't need to look at them again. In the long hours of work, he has revised and considered countless times, and he can be so firmly confident.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Talking About New Year Pictures <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>The New Year pictures in the old customs, the New Year pictures I want to talk about now, are the New Year pictures of Hebei Province under that special environment. In the past, the New Year pictures of Hebei Province could probably be divided into three categories.</p>
<p>The first is stone prints on pink paper or woodblock prints, with bright red and green colors, and very heavy color matching. Most of them are printed very badly. The black line outline is first printed on the paper, and then when reprinting various colors, they often do not match the outline. Therefore, when a character or other thing is published in this picture, it becomes a blurred shadow that is twisted to the east and skewed to the west. This is a handicraft. There is also a kind of printing that is more refined than the kind mentioned above. It is printed on newsprint by machine. The size of these two kinds is the same (two and a half feet wide and one foot high, rectangular). The content is also taken from a martial arts, funny, loyal, filial, chaste, or obscene old opera, or several fat children, as well as auspicious paintings that are warmly welcomed by farmers, such as the Heavenly Official Giving Blessings and Treasure Horses Carrying Gold.</p>
<p>Second: These are horizontal banners that are twice as large as the previous two. They were not very popular at first. The themes are all fragments of old novels, a folk tale, or stories of agricultural harvest, etc. After the September 18th Incident, another kind of painting appeared. For example, the Volunteer Army jumped up to resist the enemy, occupied "Shenyang City", and "Bombed Jinzhou", etc. By the end of 1933, there were even more farcical scenes of puppets taking the stage, Ma Zhanshan's snowy night march, and the heroic Shanghai Battle of the 19th Route Army, the magnificent posture of the civilian volunteer big sword teams, and the wounded soldier hospitals and ambulances in the rear. In the north, there were New Year pictures of the 29th Army's bloody defense of Xifengkou, Sun Dianying's deep penetration of the isolated army, and the loss of the world's first pass. ... The materials taken by the authors of these paintings were mostly reproductions or derivations of wartime photographs and news articles from newspapers and books in major ports.</p>
<p>In terms of consciousness, some parts contain patriotic ideas, and other parts can be said to be faithful reports. In terms of expression techniques, they all inherit the old forms of the past, so they can only reveal things to the farmers in an unsophisticated way, but cannot move their emotions.</p>
<p>Third, are exquisite and realistic small four-frame books, mostly scenery, serial pictures of old novels with broken waists and truncated backs, or longer legends, as well as depictions of elegant small decorations such as piano, chess, calligraphy, painting, pine, bamboo, and plum. In addition, there is a kind of vertical or horizontal large rectangle, with extremely exquisite painting, color, and paper materials. The things printed on it are god statues, beauties, famous horses, Chinese movie stars, opera costumes, and barefooted girls with disheveled hair. Therefore, this painting also brings new influences. The young men and women in the families of the wealthy in general towns and towns are doing their best to imitate the clothes and costumes of the people in the paintings, so the current clothes of the local young masters and young ladies are somewhat nondescript and semi-urbanized—the patrons of this valuable painting are all landlords, merchants, agency staff, and the families of petty officials.</p>
<p>The first category is that the masses are anesthetized by evil thoughts for many years. Although they are currently in extreme poverty, they have to place their fantasies on auspicious paintings, or inherit the transmitted anesthetic power to "appreciate" the only toxic painting. Because in terms of purchasing power, this kind of painting is also the most suitable.</p>
<p>The third category is for people who have nowhere to use their energy all year round. The older generation knows that they have done a lot of evil, so they buy a statue of a god to worship, repair their afterlife, or talk about things that are not as good as the past while looking at the paintings and feeling sentimental, and take the opportunity to play with some refreshing elegance. The younger generation loves the novelty of different places, bold eroticism, and wants to know more about the enjoyment of the owners of other places.</p>
<p>What we need to pay attention to here is the second category. It is a commercial venture with merchants starting from the point of seeking profit, and although the content contains many components that speak for themselves, it can partially reflect reality, and the effect of painting in poor remote areas that the power of newspapers cannot reach. It does have a wide range of groups, although it is sometimes toxic. However, in the absence of another better mass art to take on this task now, this kind of New Year picture has its own significance.</p>
<p>Artists of the new era, please do not neglect this department of art. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Life of Romain Rolland <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yongni</p>
<p>This year is the seventieth birthday of Romain Rolland. The seventy-year life of this great representative of European culture marks the milestones in the progress of world culture. To explore the path of his ideological development, it is necessary to relive the biography of this historical giant.</p>
<p>Romain Rolland was born in 1866 in a small market town in central France to a modest family. His father was a notary, and his mother was a staunch Catholic believer. Romain Rolland's childhood, according to Jean Bonnerot, the author of "The Biography of Romain Rolland," was probably like Olivier in "Jean-Christophe," a blond, thin, not very tall child. He inherited the temperament of a revolutionary from his revolutionary great-grandfather. When he was still a child, the memory of the Commune in 1871 penetrated deeply into his small brain. He was raised in the tradition of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment. His faith and his love of music were influenced by his mother.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Franco-Prussian War, he began to study at the local school. His parents originally hoped that he would study mathematics and physics in the future, but Rolland, who had a strong need for fantasy, legends, and beliefs, did not like mathematical sciences. He loved music so much that it seemed that without music, there would be no fun. This unparalleled love for music can be said to be a major feature of the young Rolland's personality. In addition to the music of Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner, etc., what he loved was Shakespeare's plays.</p>
<p>Because of his enthusiasm for classical music and Shakespeare, Rolland failed the teacher's college entrance examination twice, and only managed to pass it on the third try. He initially intended to study literature, but only began to study history and geography in his second year. This had a great influence on his life as an artist, because studying history and geography, and taking a broad view of the past and present, not only expanded his horizons, making him a supranationalist later on, but also provided his various works, especially his masterpiece "Jean-Christophe," with great ideas and rich materials.</p>
<p>From his childhood in the countryside, Rolland loved great people, heroes, and artists of the world. However, his love was different from the ordinary young man's worship of heroes, but only a longing for heroes with a deep love for God and man. He was obsessed with Prometheus, who resisted Zeus and stole fire for mankind, and admired and admired Tolstoy, an idealist who appeared in the European literary world at that time as an apostle of the only God. As an unknown French youth, he boldly wrote to this great Russian writer, asking him for guidance on how to live and how to create. Tolstoy sensed great sincerity in this letter and, exceptionally, wrote back to this young man. This was a long letter of thirty-eight pages, all written in French. "Dear friend," the letter began, "I received your first letter. It touched my heart. I read it with tears." Regarding art, he also wrote down his opinions. "Only art that unites people is the only valuable art. A valuable artist does not hesitate to sacrifice for his beliefs. The first prerequisite for all real occupations is not the love of art, but the love of mankind. Only those who are filled with such love are suitable for doing what an artist is worth doing." From then on, Rolland became a loyal disciple of Tolstoy, and the sound of Tolstoy's righteousness resounded loudly in his art.</p>
<p>After graduating from the Normal School with honors, Rolland was sent by the school to study in Rome. In Rome, he saw the beautiful Italian scenery and the brilliant ancient art. The Shakespearean plays he saw there revived his dreams of the past. He intended to learn from Shakespeare how he portrayed England in historical dramas, and to write about the Renaissance era in dramas. One day, while walking on the Janiculum, one of the seven hills of Rome, he decided to write a work with the whole of Europe as the stage. This was the beginning of his later masterpiece "Jean-Christophe." He met the German revolutionary Malwida von Meysenbug in Rome. This old woman, who lived a tragic, sad, and ridiculed life, but always maintained a quiet, clear, and young soul, can be said to be Rolland's second mother. He wrote "Jean-Christophe" partly under her inspiration and suggestion.</p>
<p>After passing the thesis entitled "The Origin of Modern Lyrical Drama," he became a lecturer in music at the Normal School in Paris. He launched a "People's Theater" movement to oppose the bourgeois dramas of the metropolis, and wrote three revolutionary plays: "July 14," "Danton," and "Wolves." He sang the praises of popular art (art and theater for the people and by the people). From 1900 to 1903, he wrote many drama essays, which were later collected in the book "People's Theater."</p>
<p>In 1904, he wrote "The Life of Michelangelo," and later wrote "The Life of Tolstoy," which together with his early "The Life of Beethoven" formed a series of "Heroic Biographies."</p>
<p>In 1904, he began to write his novel "Jean-Christophe." This was his lifelong work. In it, the author made a profound and merciless analysis of the evils of capitalism, completely exposing the mask of decadent bourgeois culture, and portrayed a typical intellectual with a strong personality and heroic aspirations.</p>
<p>Romain Rolland, who was once known in Paris as a music specialist and playwright, although he wrote outstanding biographies and dramas, and completed the great "Jean-Christophe," and was already forty years old, had not yet received fame and monetary rewards. The "tragedy of French idealism" he spoke of had been personally experienced. It was not until 1914, when he was almost fifty years old, that the world recognized the existence of Romain Rolland as a great artist and idealist. The French Academy of Literature awarded a prize to the ten volumes of "Jean-Christophe," and at the same time, the world's Nobel Prize was awarded to the author of this great work.</p>
<p>1914 was not a happy year for Rolland. The World War broke out in September of that year. This was a very painful blow to Rolland. He left his motherland and fled to Switzerland, publishing his famous anti-war essay "Above the Battle" in Joutnal de Geneve, waging a bloodless war against war with the weapons of pacifism.</p>
<p>The crisis of post-war capitalism from 1919 to 1920 made many progressive writers gradually sympathize with the revolution, and the "Clarté" group, which combined all thinkers and artists who sympathized with the revolution, was formed, and Rolland was a famous member of this group. As he himself admitted in the preface to his collection of essays "Fifteen Years of Combat," the five years from 1920 to 1927 were a period of hesitation and groping for him, and he did not say goodbye to his petty-bourgeois past and join the new team until later. The famous "Farewell to the Past" is an important document in which Rolland clearly expressed his new creed.</p>
<p>This ideological transformation was reflected in his "The Enchanted Soul," published in 1933. The first volume, written from 1923 to 1926, bears clear traces of the author's hesitation, but the final part reflects the author's new world view.</p>
<p>Continuous literary activities did not prevent Rolland from actively participating in the social liberation movement. His practical activities against imperialism and war are well known to the world. And this, like Barbusse, who died not long ago, and Gorky, who is still alive, is precisely where Rolland is greatest.</p>

<p>— Mei Zhi</p>
<p>Junior middle school was over, but I couldn't find a job despite exhausting all my efforts. With the adventurous mentality of "recovering capital" from a gambling den, my father borrowed one hundred dollars by hook or by crook. I myself crammed day and night to review those subjects, and finally passed the silkworm breeding school, which was said to earn fifty or sixty dollars a month after graduation.</p>
<p>Less than half a month after entering, it was time to raise silkworms. The five rooms we used to call classrooms are now filled with round bamboo trays. The tiny black ant-like things placed in the trays require the energy of more than twenty poor girls to care for. The first sleep stage is over, and now it is the time when they eat the most leaves. More than twenty of us often can't sleep well for most of the night.</p>
<p>After being woken up by my roommate, I knew it was almost time to go to work. Drowsily putting on my clothes, I touched the classroom by the light of the stars in the sky. My head was stinging slightly, and my eyes seemed to be covered with a thin film. I only saw piles of grayish-white wriggling animals in the round trays and green mulberry leaves, but my eyes could hardly see them. I hurriedly grabbed the mulberry leaves, chopped them finely with a knife, and mechanically sent them handful by handful into the trays. Running back and forth like this, my legs were so weak that I just wanted to lie on the floor. My eyelids also wanted to close tightly. There were still more than a dozen trays of leaves that had not been added, and I could not rest. I was cutting the leaves without any feeling, my eyes often closing unconsciously, dozing off with a shudder, but the iron-faced image of the dorm supervisor was always waving before my eyes. I don't know how long it went on like this, when suddenly there was a "whoosh" sound, and a cold and thorny sensation drilled straight into my heart. This shock made me open my eyes wide. Looking down, I saw steaming blood gushing out from my ring finger and middle finger. Fresh, steaming blood was flowing on the mulberry leaves and the cutting board. I didn't feel any pain, but my hand seemed to be paralyzed. I didn't feel scared, and I didn't even think about how to stop the bleeding, but just held these two fingers with my left hand. The blood continued to drip onto the floor like two drops, and the blood on the floor quickly formed a red sun, one point at a time. This color emitted a glittering brilliance, and the surrounding darkness was suffocating me. The lamplight, as big as the tears of a resentful woman, was emitting a color like the face of a dying person. This color, like the face of an anemic person, immediately made me think: blood is flowing from my own body right now! This color, this color! Oh my! Why has my face turned like this! The whole house was filled with the faces of dying people, the faces of anemic people! This is Ying! This is skinny Li's face, and that is the crying Fang. Oh no! What happened to you all… I shouted as if I was possessed.</p>
<p>This sound startled Wang in the next room, and the first thing she saw when she ran in was the blood on the floor. She panicked and didn't know what to do. She stood by the door for a while and ran away. After a while, she woke up our dorm supervisor, a widowed old woman in her fifties. This tigress kept scolding all the way, "Making a fuss in the middle of the night…" But when she came in and saw me, a Zen master who had lost too much blood, she was a little flustered too. She looked at my hand, but turned around and told Wang to go to her room to get the water pipe. The water pipe! When someone is in danger, is she thinking about smoking?…</p>
<p>But Wang had no choice but to get it for her. The tigress opened the tobacco pouch, grabbed a handful of tobacco, and aimed it at my bleeding wound. Press. Oh my! Heavens! This was even more painful than a sharp knife piercing my heart. My eyes seemed to be sparking, my hands jumping up like fleas, my heart jumping up too, my face burning like a drunkard's. I endured the tears and listened to this mother's lecture. Raising a hand that was burning with pain, I was helped back to my bed by Wang. I was seized by anger, sadness, and pain. I thought of my father's frustrated face after how many bows he had to make to borrow a sum of money from fat Zhu at four percent interest, I thought of the hardships this old woman had put me through since entering the school, and I thought of the graduates who often came back to negotiate with the old woman but got no results... Graduation! Finding a job! Supporting a family! Holding this painful hand, I cried myself to sleep on the bed.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Siam Opposes the "New Press Law" <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>After Venezuela's victory in opposing press censorship, we see that the people's representatives of Siam are also opposing the "New Press Law," which is similar to press censorship regulations. According to a telegram from Bangkok, the capital of Siam, published on February 29th: In the extraordinary session of the Siamese parliament, the people's representatives proposed a case of "opposing the New Press Law." The main reason stated: "The government must grant the press the highest right to freedom of speech. If the government has no fault, why fear attacks in words?" As a result, it has been passed in the meeting, acknowledging the reason in principle, and is now being reviewed by nine people. It is found that this case is sympathetic to the damage done to the speech, assembly, association, and education of overseas Chinese in Thailand.</p>
<p>The demand for freedom of speech can be said to be a common feeling of people all over the world. It is not only to fight for the rights that people should enjoy, but also a sharp weapon for the entire country and the entire nation to fight for independence and survival. We should all express sympathy for Venezuela's opposition to press censorship regulations and the proposal of the people's representatives of Siam to oppose the "New Press Law."</p>
<p>As for Siam, a country, a primary school teacher who had lived there for a long time and is still being unreasonably oppressed once told me. Although Siam is nominally an independent constitutional monarchy, most of the power is in the hands of the British. Recently, because a certain imperialist obtained part of the power in that place, the policy of fooling the people followed the economic invasion, and the result was the promulgation of the "New Press Law" and the closure or unreasonable expulsion of schools run by overseas Chinese. Not long ago, I believe everyone will not forget the tension of the anti-Chinese atmosphere in Siam. Now, their people are aware and dare to propose opposition to the "New Press Law," which is the second point that we have to admire. At the same time, we can see that only the weak truly sympathize with the weak. The people of Siam do not exclude the Chinese. Anti-Chinese sentiment is just a means of imperialism.</p>
<p>Now, let's go back to whether the opposition to the "New Press Law" is reasonable? Of course, it is undeniably reasonable, as long as the government is still the people's government. As the representative put forward the reason: "If the government has no fault, why fear attacks in words?" True speech is not an attack on the government, but a contribution of opinions and a correction of those faults. It is about the "matter," not the "government." For example, not long ago, the people of Britain and France opposed the "Italian-Abyssinian Peace Agreement," opposing the government's failure to sacrifice weak nations and giving convenience to aggressors, not opposing the government. This is very obvious. From this, we can understand the reason why "the government must give the press the highest right to freedom of speech." At the same time, speech is also a sharp weapon of national defense, much like the current international news agencies, such as the French Havas Agency, the British Reuters Agency, the Japanese Denstu Agency, the Allied News Agency, the Soviet TASS, etc., which one does not speak for their own country.</p>
<p>In addition to hoping that the Siamese government will realize and return freedom to the people, we also hope that all countries with similar unreasonable laws on press censorship will also automatically abolish them.</p>

<p>Nora was telling Helmer how to handle the housework after she left. The doorbell in the outer hall rang, and the maid Ellen came in and said, "A lady visitor wants to see you, Madam."</p>
<p>Helmer instructed her not to see the visitor, and then went to the study. Ellen led Mrs. Linden in.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: (Hesitatingly, with doubt) Nora, how are you?</p>
<p>Nora: (Suspiciously) How am I?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: I see you don't recognize me anymore.</p>
<p>Nora: Don't I? Oh, yes! That's right! (Suddenly becoming happy) What, Christine, is that really you?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: Yes, it's really me!</p>
<p>Nora: Christine, imagine, I didn't even recognize you! But I can't be blamed! (Lowering her voice) Christine, you really have changed!</p>

<p>— Zhuo Er</p>
<p>The weather is very hot, the capacity of the carriage is small, and there are many people, making it difficult to even breathe. Although every window is open, it is still suffocating, and I feel a bit dizzy! If you stick your head out of the car, it will be even worse. Coal ash flying from the front of the car will cover your face and body in black, and it might even get into your eyes, which would be even more uncomfortable. The passengers in the third-class carriage probably deserve this!</p>
<p>The train is crawling south step by step, naturally going further and further away from home. Due to nostalgia for home and unease about the unfamiliar new land, the feeling of being in a strange place is really uncomfortable, isn't it? Even the voices of the hawkers outside the station cannot be understood at all! It's like stepping into a foreign country. Everything is unfamiliar, unfamiliar. The only familiar things are the familiar natural scenery of the train and the lush green fields! Even so, at that time I seemed very conceited and said in a low voice: How vast and beautiful is the land that belongs to us! But, immediately there was a heavy blow, shattering this boastful illusion, that is: Half of the country has fallen into the hands of the enemy!</p>
<p>…My mood is drifting like gossamer, unable to be restrained, and like a ball of tangled hemp, unable to be quickly cleared. Fragments of memories swirl in my mind like a revolving lantern, and soon they lead me into an incomprehensible entanglement… I am tired. A new stimulus I received was the stiff-faced, self-important, and ugly attitude of that great citizen of a friendly nation sitting in the corner on the east side! His face is always raised, desperately raised, as if there is something noteworthy on the roof of the car!…</p>
<p>I don’t know when, I was accosted by a fellow villager and we started talking. He spoke so enthusiastically in our hometown dialect, and I felt like I had met a relative.</p>
<p>…“So, why did you go to Guandong?” I asked him again.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it because I couldn’t stay at home anymore? You figure it out: drought followed by flooding, flooding followed by drought, war and chaos, bandits everywhere. How could I stay in my hometown? Who would want to leave their own home?” He said, and the word “bitter” was simply written on his face.</p>
<p>I, I also came from my hometown (but unlike him, I abandoned my hometown, not being driven away by it).</p>
<p>“What do you do in Guandong?”</p>
<p>“A poor person is poor wherever he goes! Anyway, I rely on my strength to eat!” He sighed deeply, “Everyone says you can get rich in Guandong! Get rich? How can someone like me who relies on physical labor get rich? That really has to wait for the sun to rise in the west!”</p>
<p>“How is Guandong now? Can the people live and work in peace?” (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Qiu Yuan</p>
<p>Zhuo Shi reached out his hand again, hugged her, and concentrated all his strength on her lips, deeply kissing Qiu Hua. Although, Zhuo Min had not never kissed a woman, but this kiss was not as pleasant as this one, not as meaningful as this one! After kissing, of course, they kissed again. This exchange of emotions transmitted through the lips, and the resonance of their pounding hearts, gave them a feeling that seemed even more sublime – a feeling that was more religious than emotional. He seemed to be in a tall and spacious Gothic church, with no one around, quietly. Qiu Hua seemed to have turned into Saint Mary. Zhuo Min had never experienced this sublime feeling before. Never before had a woman made him feel this sublime, somewhat religious, when Zhuo Min kissed her. For those women, the pleasure of kissing was limited to kissing, and if there was pleasure at all. He regarded them as women, and the kissing between men and women, in this kind of situation, also became a procedure rather than a rite. But today, as Zhuo Min kissed Qiu Hua, the tranquility in his heart was indescribable. He felt that what he had won was not only the love of a woman, he had found faith, found salvation, found the reason why life is precious as life. He savored Qiu Hua's words: "Of course, but we are different," which gave him even greater satisfaction in his heart.</p>

<p>We all know... How painful and embarrassing it would be if someone forced us to shake hands with our enemies!</p>
<p>The pain of Da Sheng Lin Zeqi being forced by his father to marry a woman he does not love is also imaginable. He wanted to use his strength to resist, but he knew that his father's idea was completely influenced by his stepmother, and his father was also innocent. This situation extinguished his bursting courage. However, how embarrassing it was for him!</p>
<p>He felt like he was traveling alone in the middle of a vast desert: He didn't know when the yellow sand would come; He didn't know when a big eagle would fly by; He didn't know when a horse thief would attack; He didn't know when the water in the bottle would run dry. All around him was desolate and lonely. Looking behind, he didn't know where his hometown was; Looking ahead, he didn't know where the foreign country was. If the water in his bottle ran dry and he was extremely thirsty, if another traveler suddenly met him at this time and gave him a drink of cool water, how grateful and tearful would he be? But this kind of traveler is not easy to find.</p>
<p>Loneliness, desolation, loneliness, panic, filled his entire heart. Therefore, he could only waste his youthful time in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Bai Qiuying, a coffee shop waitress, was a young woman who was also forced out of her family's small desert and escaped to this large desert of society. However, she had a great expectation, hoping that her missing lover, Li Qianqing, would come to find her one day. For this reason, although she had suffered the insults and deceptions of those frivolous guests, she always endured it and never complained to anyone.</p>
<p>It was a late night in early winter. The fire in the coffee shop was still burning so brightly, but most of the guests had dispersed and left reluctantly. The only one who was reluctant to leave was Lin Zeqi. He wanted to use whiskey to numb his wounded heart. The theater behind closed, and a group of customers walked in amid laughter. When Bai Qiuying went to greet them, she discovered the hope she had endured and waited for so bitterly for several years – her lover, Li Qianqing. With a heart full of enthusiasm and joy, she called out to her lover. She wanted to pour out all the difficulties and hardships she had endured over the years in her lover's arms. Who knew that the reality was completely unexpected: Li Qianqing had already completely forgotten her and had fallen in love with someone else. He originally wanted to completely ignore her, recognizing her as a complete stranger. But he also thought that he had written her many love letters and taken a photo of the two of them holding hands. Bai Qiuying might use these things to announce his crimes and break up his marriage with his new love. Therefore, he had to tempt her with money. He took out a thousand dollars to buy back the letters and photos he had written to her.</p>
<p>This situation made Lin Zeqi in the next seat unable to bear it any longer. He told Bai Qiuying not to take his money; She did not have to return those evidences to him; And that he should announce his many crimes to the community, to punish those unkind people. However, Bai Qiuying only said with tears in her eyes: "I forgive him, you also forgive him!" She returned all the letters and photos to him; She threw the whole thousand green and red banknotes into the burning charcoal basin without any stinginess, and a burst of brilliant sparks rose in the charcoal basin.</p>
<p>Li Qianqing's business was done, and he left impatiently.</p>
<p>Because Lin Zeqi came here every day, Bai Qiuying already had a very harmonious relationship with him. Lin Zeqi had told Bai Qiuying about his own pain; Bai Qiuying had also told Lin Zeqi about her own sadness. They already had a sympathetic heart to each other. After this stimulus, they became even more deeply aware of each other. In the world, only hungry people sympathize with hungry people; Only disappointed people sympathize with disappointed people; Finally, they joined hands, like lonely travelers in the desert who met an eternal companion, no longer lonely; Nor is there any more panic. As Lin Zeqi said: "With this pair of travelers in the desert, the yellow sand will cover</p>

<p>A beautiful woman in Xiaoxiang Pavilion,</p>
<p>Sick and sad, her heart grieves.</p>
<p>She cherishes the beauty of the flowers on the branches,</p>
<p>And gets up early in spring to busily dress.</p>
<p>She orders the maid to insert them on the branches,</p>
<p>And to protect them from sparrows.</p>
<p>But the heavens always work against her,</p>
<p>With frequent heavy rains and raging winds.</p>
<p>They destroy the thousands of red and purple blooms,</p>
<p>Leaving the trees without fragrance.</p>
<p>It is like a beautiful woman encountering misfortune,</p>
<p>Her beauty fades and her life is short.</p>
<p>The Xiaoxiang Fairy is extremely sentimental,</p>
<p>And her heart breaks when she sees the scene.</p>
<p>She thinks that her delicate body is like a flower,</p>
<p>But she often suffers from illnesses like encountering a storm.</p>
<p>She suddenly has a feeling of shared suffering,</p>
<p>So she carries a hoe to the tree and builds a beautiful tomb to bury the petals.</p>
<p>She mourns and weeps before the grave,</p>
<p>Her sad and painful tears soaking her clothes.</p>
<p>It is beyond her power to turn back the tide, and she hates it.</p>
<p>Because it is difficult to find an immortality pill in the world,</p>
<p>And there is no resurrection fragrance.</p>
<p>Today I bury the withered flowers,</p>
<p>Who will bury me one day?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, her heart aches again,</p>
<p>And she bids farewell to the tomb and returns to Xiaoxiang.</p>
<p>When her burning manuscripts scatter her fragrant soul in the future,</p>
<p>Like falling flowers, she drifts to the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>Although the beautiful woman dies, her name will be remembered.</p>

Therefore, Lu Ji's singing teaching will be temporarily suspended tonight, and will continue on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of next week. It is also heard that the broadcasting group of the Public Singing Association will also join the broadcast.

<p>Starting today (Friday), the Cathay Grand Theatre will screen Paramount's latest chivalrous and passionate blockbuster, "Rose of the Rancho," starring Glenda Swarthout and John Boles. John Boles is already familiar to the public and needs no introduction. Glenda Swarthout, the most popular singer at the New York Metropolitan Opera, is welcomed by Americans alongside first-rate actresses such as Grace Moore and is known as the "American Standard Beauty." This time, she dedicates herself to the screen, and although it is her first attempt, she has achieved amazing results. The film's content is also very substantial, and it also features moving songs and unique dances.</p>
<p>"A Tale of Two Cities" Before the Guillotine, Screening in Nanjing Today</p>

<p>The "Song of Everlasting Regret" encountered a lawsuit involving a "Little Lin Daiyu," and Carlo made a few days of business. The second round of screenings by the Central and Southeast theaters also dramatically shut their doors. Commentators say that in the future, when writing screenplays, one should first anticipate the potential for litigation; this is also one of the new advertising techniques of 1936.</p>
<p>When China's second sound detective film, "The Diamond," is released, the advertisement could also use wording such as "Due to the main character issue in this film, the entire publicity department of our company resigned en masse." Compared to "Hundreds of gunshots," perhaps it could sell a few more full houses and produce "China's Third Sound Detective Film."</p>
<p>(The Master said: Long live Chinese cinema!)</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang's cameo as Pan Jinlian at the Tianchan Theatre was naturally quite a gimmick. Recently, the Empire Theatre has also been rehearsing an authentic "bouncing opera" version of Pan Jinlian, which is selling out due to Cao Juren's criticism and statement.</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang once wanted to appear on the silver screen, starring in "Begonia Red," but for some reason, it disappeared without a trace. Everyone in the film industry is complaining about being poor, because the films don't make money. Now that we have this Eastern Mae West, who can still draw crowds like Hu Die, and no one is thinking of bringing her to the screen, I truly feel sorry for the Oriental United Art Society.</p>
<p>According to reader letters, the editing fee for "Twentieth Century" has been reduced from one hundred and twenty yuan to fifty yuan starting this month.</p>
<p>(The Master said: Quite tough! The Inner Historian said: Perhaps there are other subsidies, otherwise, how can they break even?)</p>
<h3 id="e219">Renewal Issue of "Art Sound" Published <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The "Art Sound" film and music monthly, edited by Chen Jiazhen, has been popular since its publication. Due to its lively and fresh content, it has been well-received by readers. After active reorganization and improvement, it appears in the publishing industry of 1936 with the greatest effort.
