<p>時評</p>
<h3>大廟子收復的重要性</h3>
<p>— 起</p>
<p>自從克服百靈廟以後。我國軍隊在綏遠奏了第二次奇功。大廟子攻下消息的傳來。使國人又復感了根大的振奮。</p>
<p>就軍事的情勢說。大廟子的地位是很重要的。百靈廟失去以後。大廟子就成了匪偽最重要的軍事根據地。在這根據地整理殘部。補充實力。匪僞隨時可以襲擊百靈廟。如其百靈廟一經震撼。便可進而脅迫包頭。歸綏。牽動綏遠的全局。再則我軍如圖在緩東有所進展。更非淸除這綏北方面的心腹之患不可。綏北旣無所顧忌。我軍便可集中力量。由綏東方面開展出去。實現規復失地的計劃。要之。消極方面澈底淸除綏北隨時被擾的可能性。積極方面張開一個向綏東方面推展的新局面。百靈廟與大廟子的收復就在上述的情勢下顯示了特殊的重要性。</p>
<p>在最近我軍勝利的戰蹟中。我們可以得到下列三項的昭示。</p>
<p>第一。最近的勝利。有力地證明了「失敗主義」的錯誤。一直到最近。還有許多人懷疑着我國軍隊抗戰的力量。這一班人以爲我國的軍隊。無論在武器或其他設備上。都不够和敵軍相比。因之萬難取得勝利。可是。這决攻我的匪僞軍。軍械服裝都由策動的某方供給。並且還有某方的軍官指揮參戰。結果呢。我軍居然一再獲勝。收復了百靈廟大廟子這樣的重鎭。鐵一般的事實吿訴我們。我軍是有着很强的戰鬥力量的。</p>
<p>第二。由這兩决勝利中。我們可以看出。我們的軍事應該轉入一個有利的傾向——從消極的抵禦轉向積極的規復失土。無論就軍事技術上或其他方面着眼。我們祇有造成事實上的優勢。然後可以獲得勝利。設想若使我軍僅以抵禦敵人的攻擊兢兢自守。不積極地攻克像百靈廟這樣的軍事重要根據地。也許綏北綏東早已受到比現在不知嚴重多少倍的脅迫。有人不主張有什麼積極性的軍事行動。理由是冀免敵人擴大的糾纏。不知這樣消極的主張。如果應用起來。正是敵人擴大糾纏的根源。惟有發　積極性的行動才能斬除我們當前的糾籐。</p>
<p>第三。從偽匪的紛紛反正的事實。我們獲得了有利於我們形勢的確信。觀察綏戰而懷有悲觀心理的人。往往有一種錯誤的觀察。以爲偽匪乃至其後面策動者是一個和諧無間的單一體。以他們單一體的整個力量來與我們局部抗。自然只有我敗人勝的結局。他們不明瞭。偽匪乃至其後面策動者自身亦有許多矛盾間隙。我們要儘可能地利用這樣的矛盾。造成我們絕大的優勢。此次大廟的收復是。以王英部石玉山等的反正爲其先聲。就是一個明證。</p>

<h3>英國會通過三讀　遜位議案成法律　獨立工黨修正文否決　新皇定今日宣佈登極　號「喬治六世」而非「亞爾培一世」</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日下午一時五十二分、國會宣佈英皇贊同遜位議案後、一九三六年一月二十日午夜前五分鐘喬治五世大崩時承繼皇位之愛德華八世、遂不復爲英國君主印度皇帝矣、</p>
<p>英國新君將爲的克公爵亞爾培親王、的克公爵夫人將爲皇后、其九歲女伊里莎伯將爲儲君、</p>
<p>國會兩院今日於二時三十分之時間內、以其中古時代莊嚴之禮節三讀通過遜位議案、十五分鐘內、該議案經皇照准後、卽由國會書記公布、於是遂成法律、愛德華八世從此退爲平民、而可與其愛人辛浦生夫人自由結婚矣、</p>
<p>今晨首相以簡短之詞在下院動議二讀該案、而仍以從速恢複國家常狀以保和平爲言、繼其發言者、亦作如是論、反對黨領袖艾特里起立贊助該案、惟謂皇位現已為凡俗諂諛所危、宜使之平庸化、自由黨領袖辛克萊亦贊助該案、獨立工黨議員馬克斯頓則提出拒絕該案之修正文、並主張廢棄世襲之皇位、內相西門繼起致詞、謂近今之事變、已證明英國人民之胸懷中隊於立憲郡主制所蘊觀念之如何深切云云、於是下院遂以四〇三對五票否決馬氏之修正文、而通過案之二讀、</p>
<p>該案爲文芸短、首列序言、下列三欵、遜位詔亦含具案內、第一欵爲歷史性的、而無前例可援、規定經皇兪允後、遜位詔應郎發生效力、愛德華皇八世於是不復爲君主、皇冕應作傳遺、故當由皇族中承繼遜位之其决者接受之、第二欵規定愛德華皇八世與其或有之子息及此子息之後裔在遜位後、於皇位之承繼、均無任何權益、第三欵規定皇家結婚律對皇族中人所擬作之婚姻、須由國皇允准一節、在遜位後、不得施於愛德華皇與其或有之子息、及此子息之後裔，</p>

<h3>昨晚西青籃球　辛隊又敗於麥令甲　三五比五五表演毫不精彩　陸鐘恩洛克兩人發生互毆</h3>
<p>西靑籃球、昨晚辛隊又以三十五與九十五之比、敗於麥令甲、辛隊在獨立組中之希望、似已渺遠、更不宰者、於比賽將完畢前三四分鐘時、陸鍾恩與洛克忽發生互毆、幸勸解即息、兩人同時下塲、比賽得安然完畢、以表演論、辛隊確不如麥令、攻守雙方、俱無特色、麥令一路佔先到底、辛隊始終屈居下風、上半時麥令以卅一比十七佔先、尙有大學組一塲、復日勝同濟、六十八比二十、上半時四十一比八分、乙組一塲、慕爾勝菲列賓、四十五比十二、辛隊收於麥令甲、經過如下、</p>
<p>失敗原因辛隊失敗之原因有二、一為辛隊之守衛太差、五人之中、許文奎根本不能守衛、在麥令猛烈進攻時、常見許置身其他一角、於是隙漏時呈、祇見麥令五人、出入辛隊籃下不息、加以麥令身材高大、使辛隊防守困難、乃犯規纍纍、卒由裁判員之罰球、而遷怒麥令、殊為辛隊不智、至於進攻方面、因麥令之五人聯防、嚴密非凡、辛隊竟呈棘手、麥令射籃尙不甚高明、機會甚多、如果一一得中、辛隊更將敗成落花流水也、</p>
<p>一蹶不振接觸之後、麥令猛衝至籃下、連連射擲、無一得中、許文奎回身得球、先開記錄、洛克與祥龍等、相互中的、成各五之平手、是為最緊張之時期、從此辛隊、即一蹶不振、麥令連加十餘分之多、以十八比七、居辛隊之上、祥龍文奎念華雖奪回五分、然終不能遏麥令之勢、兩方積分、愈去愈遠、二十五比十二後、麥令仍不絕加分、上半時結果、為三十一比十七、相差十四、</p>
<p>發生互毆下半時起、麥令仍取猛烈之攻勢、惜乎射籃技術、故雖在籃下屢决徘徊、好久未得分數、許文奎遠中一球後、馮念華四决犯規出、麥令之分數、又驟見高漲、成三十九比二十二、相差又為十七分之鉅、祥龍文奎、雖一再努力、始終如此距離、不易得變、四十九比三十分、陸鍾恩看住洛克於自已籃旁、偶一誤會、洛克性起、兩手遂發生拳鬥、調解後同時下塲、華鳳崗入替、五十四比二十三、祥龍亦罰出、辛隊以四人應付終局、結果五十五比三十五、</p>
<p>復旦勝同濟</p>
<p>復旦勝同濟之大學組、同濟正式球員、缺席甚多、全非復旦敵手、上半時復旦得四十一分之餌、同濟僅八分耳成</p>

<p>昨晚朱其良之演出、為其生平得意之作、勝勃爾克雖僅六分、巳殊不易矣、當上塲時、朱其良不可一世、一槍三十四、再槍四十九、造成一六二比九〇之優勢、勃氏屈伏已久、至時亦昂然作驚吼、一槍五十、意又不足、又來五十、心花大放、第三槍再得五十、乃一躍出前、多十八分、從此雙方掙扎之烈、前此罕見、勃氏又加四十·二三兩槍、離目的僅六分、朱其良究屬上將之材、戰來毫不慌忙、而精彩槍頭、源源發現、二十一·二十四·三十一·三槍之後、又繼續一槍二十一、首先達到三百分、可謂難能可貴、</p>

<p>昨日華商證券交易所、公債市勢復呈堅挺、價亦上漲、　聲勢雄厚之某金融　戶、實力拋　已漸减少、而市塲人氣仍極堅强、散戶吸收　量愈量見增加、市况鑒於時局安靖及多方買氣蓬勃、由盤　而趨上升、惟目前債市之醖釀、多空相爭由盤旋而趨上升、惟目前債市之醖釀、多空相爭頗稱猛烈、於　途　將　巨變之預兆也、昨、上　開盤、人心極爲安頓、散戶吸收頗屬不少、三十五·四號　買進亦湧、四十三·三十七號則仍係賣出、惟以　碼不多、市價均回漲五分至半元、丁戊本月則疲五分、决盤趨勢續呈　昂、五十四·十號等收買極爲踴躍、四十七·四十三號等則仍多賣出、除乙甲近期回跌一二角、餘　再好一二角、下午開盤、市况仍屬堅定、惟大戶均多停手、散戶交易甚湧、而多於買進、二十號　賣出丙種頗屬不少、市價祗一角許之升降、收盤行市續見上升、三十五·十一·四號等仍多買進、四十三·五十號則係賣出、除　種本月微小五分、餘均上漲一角左右、全日結果、一致漲上五分至四角半不等、九六則小一角、成交總數、計六百四　五萬元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　標紗市況平庸　雖有中棉公司來收買　終因實銷不暢而下降</h3>
<p>紗市平疲、氣勢本有下降之象、蓋以紗銷呆頓、各帮因年終關係、皆有一度結束、故生意殊覺岑寂、現紗價格步步下瀉、惟中棉公司等因存貨未積、廠根未見大鬆、對於多頭觀念未釋、另有消息、某廠恐有十支棉紗交出、總之價格　達高境、實需如果淸淡、交貨當然增多云</p>
<p>標紗前市無上落標紗前市開盤、趨勢甚形疲弱、因靑島紗廠完全復工、該處紗價下跌、而現紗客銷停滯、人心渙散、大阪　品紗亦不悅盤旋之狀、有　部份同業、傾向翻空、二盤三盤回挫迨至收盤、因中棉公司突未吸進加碼、各月跳起一元外、遠期尙平、但現紗生意甚淸、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價勿動、午後開盤、市狀平庸、上　甚少、交易不多、收盤時間甚早、大概連朝在升猛　、兩方皆有筋疲力盡之勢矣、繼以紗銷不暢、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌九·六·七角、查實出錦昌一千九百包、裕大八百五十包、振大八百包、森康四千〇五十包、望泰興二千一百包、福康一千四百包、同和一千包、愼記八百包、大昶一千二百五十包、永昌五百五十包、買進大豐一千八百包、明德八百包、合興六百五十包、大昌成　千四百五十包、泰昌一千九百五十包、益昶　千八百五十包、長豐二千一百五十包、　康一千一百五十包、一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>多方回出　期棉欲　進反卻　但以紗花價距離尙願　一部份同業仍在收進</h3>
<p>棉市始漲繼跌、市情略形回拌、但印　棉市續升、故多方　態濃厚、目多說紗價高峯疊見、棉價距離太遠、目前各鄉農地擯價甚力、售價不肯鬆落、於是拉力尙强也、</p>
<p>標花收盤空見　挫標花前市開盤、因美花棉市一致續漲、目漲勢劇烈、人心更堅、有一部份同業以紗市高昂、棉價未漲、對於棉價看漲、吸收亦巨、故檯面轉俏、各月均漲三角半、二盤略回挫、三盤復升、結果各月比上日收盤價均　二角、午後　盤、因某戶繼續猛力賣出、同時有一部份多　出　、市價九百擔、恒益三千擔、裕大二千四百　、大豐三千一百擔、賡豐一千四百擔、豐泰二千七百擔、仁豐六千上百擔、元一六千八百擔、潤康無千八百擔、同和　千擔、信誠二萬三千擔、長餘五千一百擔、義成六千九百擔、買進望泰與一萬一千五白擔、泰昌一萬一千八百擔、長豐七千二百擔、生源二千九百擔、福康五千擔、和長八千八百擔、錦禺六千六百担、益昶三千一百擔、泰興五千三百担、興三千八百担、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>通姚花各到刋餘包現棉消費尙稱不薄、來源姚花一千二百八十包、通花一千九百六十包、</p>
<h3>標花陣容擴大　徑存量四十一萬餘擔</h3>
<p>因有投機目標轉移於標花之故對於華商紗布交易所標　存賬量、大有一顧之價値、截至十二月九日止查　二月期成交廿二萬九千八　担、一月期成交四十七萬九千二百担、二月期成交四十五萬五千二百　、三月期成交五十四萬八千五百　、合計一百七十一萬二千七百担、多空兩存賬軋　、凈存量爲四十一萬五千七百担、查空頭二十五家、多頭三十九家、茲將其中買賣最巨之户、摘錄如、</p>
<h3>買戶較多　外棉一致報漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤，各月漲二至十磅音、晨初國內外同業大批限價買進、投機家亦有新買、市况頗形活潑、旋以英國政局不定、其他物價平疲、棉價亦隨之略回、夏季以來之老多頭、頗有了結、惟立卽爲人所吸收、現需較呆、廠家對於塲中之情形、殊爲驚懼、收盤前棉農套賣、一部份回小、收盤時大衆再行買進、又轉高昂、計現貨漲十四磅音、期貨漲十二至二十一磅音、英棉現貨漲四點、期貨漲三四點、印棉初因期貨商買進而漲、旋買賣互有、卒以操業者積極買進再漲、收盤前多頭了結、同業則買進平果爾及奧姆辣、計平果爾漲二·五至二·七五羅比、奧姆辣漲二至二·五羅比、白羅溪漲一·七五羅比、原電錄左、（十日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十一日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百二十三羅比半、奧姆辣爲二百零四羅比半、平果爾爲一百六十五羅比半、均漲一·二五羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗花漲跌互見</p>

<h3>糧食　洋麥有續訂說　期麥市價見鬆</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈一致鬆跌之象、以洋麥報價、上落雖少、惟以洋麥既有續定之謠、人心常然虛軟　物價究已過高　反變之來，亦不能預測、因此市情冷淡、成交甚小、價則跌二三分七八分不等、迨至、午開盤、各盤交易、巳較暢旺、價則盤旋、上落不巨、照目下下情、如洋麥逐步訂購、本外埠之投機、一部分當須放棄、市面之轉變、或亦不可免也、担麥市面。因標準鬆跌、中次各擋、亦略喊小、開山東瑤灣麥六元六角七分、蚌埠管店硤石麥六元六角半、淮城麥六元六角二分蕪湖無錫麥李元五角、江北麥六元六角、次五角七分、紹興麥六元五角二分、次五角、由福新辦一萬包、阜豐辦二萬包云、</p>
<h3>期粉浮多紛起出籠　—市價遂逐步下降—</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初定繼則逐步慘落之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處微有一角左右之出入、利物浦則好一辦士、故開價時、人心尙定、且廠方近期抵補、遠期則陸續套售、惟以前日所傳續訂洋麥據說有幾千噸成交、價為五角二分、或傳七分、因此市場浮多、紛紛出檔、一般觀望投機、亦趁機脫手、致市氣步入　游、迨至下午開盤、形勢更見虛弱、因散戶多頭、一致出籠、市面大有江河日下之槪、不過業外多頭、近期雖有回出、遠期則竭力拉住、致疲而復挺、計一日中之跌度、達六七分不等、據業中人之推測、洋麥雖　開始訂購、惟市値　不相宜、人心之軟、不過爲一時之衝動、往後如訂價步廉、則前途當不堪設想云、</p>
<h3>客秈湧到銷路亦旺</h3>
<p>客秈市居兩平之局、邇日到頭日有萬數千包、而去化亦有近萬包治萬餘包、且泉州幫辦韋甚活、日有三五千包之去化、河南幫亦接連辦裝、昨更有北幫與紹幫點綴、本街與囤戶去化亦濃、故在本客米湧到存足之際、市面仍可站足惟粵帮注意湘米直裝與洋米减稅、去化久滯、乃爲米市上展之阻力也、昨全日開贛米七千一百三十包、湘米九百十五包、溫台米　千多包、粵機米四百八十包、價與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>食米本街去路尙暢</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、因前夜被大霧阻、當略轉稀少、共到九十餘號、貨共萬八千三四百石、內中薄稻有六十餘號、本街銷塲續因天雨、人心頗佳、尙稱活絡、惟包胃動　不爽、雖有平津靑烟等帮辦薄稻七千餘包及厚粳三千餘包、然其結果薄稻行情定局、厚粳則因本街銷路尙佳、似有明定暗提趨勢、已見秀近角、早稻亦增角許、杜洋尖及陰變元悉復轉秀近尺、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來船五六十號、市上各貨去路續動、白粳價形挺秀、羊杜客尖價加三江分，埠尖亦見緊勢、薄稻高頂之貨平疲、中次者價小近角、白元包胃　辦、零星店胃亦有去化、市價漲起二三角、其餘各貨、價形挺立、</p>
<h3>標準籌碼枯涸　洋莊芝麻抬至十四元</h3>
<p>洋莊芝蔴行情、昨竟抬至十四元大關、由中央信託局辦去一千噸、日商洋行採去四百噸、（共計包額一萬六千八百包、）出售者由鎭江帮及一般多頭放出、大局依然緊俏、出於籌碼逐枯、交易所標準一味上漲、致人心蓬勃、現貨毛蔴、因之銷塲亦旺、紹帮榨油去路蟬聯不懈、昨成交各蔴四百餘包、行情續緊一二角不等、</p>

<h3>疋頭　春令疋頭　期貨成交大見遜色</h3>
<p>原因是不敢輕易開出</p>
<p>昨棉布市况、以紗市連疲、布價過高、防其反動、目年終結果將屆、冀魯蜀內地本街需要仍濃、第恐時期極為短促、而靑島及常錫南通等區、來貨將逐步加旺、多數均係交解廉價根子、致人氣漸吿衰弱、迭有低價出售、白貨細布細斜、回跌每疋五分左右、粗布原布絨布仍堅、惟重磅貨偶有回落五分一角、色布走勢亦殊尋常、綫呢以存底空乏印花貨底盤不高、市勢均尚堅固、廠方開貨寥寥、略有現貨成交、昨北路購辦白斜紋絨重磅粗布嗶嘰綫呢現貨及派貨二百餘件、蜀帮旺裝綫呢直貢及少數藍布色斜、本街及江浙內地帮搜羅輕磅粗布甚亟、市上現貨缺乏、故殊俏俐、其他細布細斜原布、均各减辦春令府綢、往年此時、期貨成交已甚繁忙、本年以紗綫高昂、織　一客戶均缺乏把握、故除日前光中等　開出現貨期貨千餘箱外、現下尚未再有開售訊息云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　印荘波斯絲銷仍活</h3>
<p>—輯里絲續有售開—</p>
<p>海外絲市、仍趨下游、昨日紐約十二月份標準絲下跌三分半、期貨跌半分、橫濱現貨開前日原價、遠期微漲三元、市氣尚難蘇醒、美法絲銷·遂吿沉寂、印荘及波斯去路、仍見活絡、昨日輯里絲續有相當售開、價頗堅穩、內銷絲昨殊淸冷、鮮有成交云、</p>
<h3>抽芯珍眉略有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日屯溪高荘珍眉綠茶、永興怡和華茶等行、均略有進胃、全市成交百餘箱、屯荘名家抽芯貨、頂盤開出九十六元、普通躉荘貨、開出五十二元、較前均無上落、至錦隆洋行、日前與各茶棧開談之大量珍眉交易、因價格關係、現正拍電國外商議中云、</p>

<h3>南北貨　生晒元肉暗鬆一二元</h3>
<p>生晒圓肉、近以銷路轉呆、號貨久無開出、查前後所到百餘件、乞未成盤、聞其間有小數急於脫手者、暗盤小去一二元、已有做過、至於海南貨存數較厚、但以成本關係、尚乏過鬆之望、後市須俟走銷轉旺、方有整批成交、</p>
<h3>五金　馬口鐵現貨大缺</h3>
<p>厚馬口鐵、最近因玩具廠等收辦、兼之熱水瓶廠亦多問津、是以市勢良好、行情受環境關係、益見鋒俏、計每磅估三角四五分、而日本方面近日亦託人在申收辦、因之現貨大缺、行情益呈鞏固、查昨開出二百數十箱、其價為二十二號售四角五分、二十四號三角五分、二十六號三角二分、二十七號二角云、</p>

<p>— 德鄰</p>
<p>目前中國整個局勢的嚴重是給××帝國主義蠶食併吞的結果；綏東事件的爆發，此次匪偽侵犯，無可異議的，這也是它幕後人所主持，和策動的。誰都知道：綏遠是我們國防的前綫，西北的屏障，所以這也是我們的生命綫，那麽我們對於在前綫禦侮作戰，守衛疆土的將士，除掉了節衣縮食，解囊捐欵，踴躍輸將，來充前方軍實，聊盡一些國民應盡的義務之外；並且應該全國下下，出全力以貢獻國家，雖然敵人是向我們的一省進攻，但是它在目的上，却在兼併我們全國，事實是很明顯的；如其它佔領了我們綏遠以後，它就可以控制山西·寗夏·甘肅等省了；整個的華北和西北，豈不是完全到了它的掌握中去，所以我說：援綏便是援已，在我們身壯力强的靑年，當然對保障領土，和完整主權要作充分的準備；不過和我們同樣是四萬五千萬同胞之一的婦女界同胞，也應該和我們聯合起來，站在同一的戰綫上，效法西班牙的婦女，為了自己的生存和自由，大家奮起來英勇衛國。</p>
<p>那西班牙的婦女，不但在後方工作，並且還有趕到前綫欲血作戰去的，可是回顧到我們國內的婦女呢？依舊陶醉在粉紅色的甜夢裏，鬧着無謂的戀愛勾當，塗脂抹粉，是每日必修的功課；且看上海今年十個月的消耗品；脂粉香水的輸入，總値在一百十餘萬元之巨，我想在這生死關頭的現在，那些貴族化的浪漫生活，是不需要的，所需要的，是一種勇敢積極的精神，和養成耐勞吃苦的習慣；試看德意志在歐戰後，兒童赤了脚進學校，蘇聯在革命後，人民都吃着黑麺包；再像日本的婦女，都具有埋頭苦幹的毅力，阿比西尼亞的婦女，拿了槍上前綫去，這不是我們良好的榜樣嗎？</p>
<p>全國婦女界的同胞，請覺悟吧！這是我們的生死存亡關頭，如其你們同有西班牙婦女英勇衛國的精神，最低限度，請節省了你們日常的脂粉香水消耗之資，來捐給前綫奮勇作點的將士，本着各人的愛國心，盡一點國民的義務。</p>
<h3>我的現代婦女觀</h3>
<p>— 胡封</p>
<p>—讀了怎樣才配做現代的婦女以後—</p>
<p>本刋四十三期上，發表一篇「怎樣才配做現代的婦女」，他提出現代婦女所應具備的三個條件：第一要有健全體格，第二要有質樸的習氣，第三要有獨立的精神。</p>
<p>我以為現代的婦女只有這三個條件還不够的，至低限度一定還要具備；</p>
<p>第四　要有對自己地位的認識。</p>
<p>過去的婦女之所以會「嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁犬隨犬」，以致中了依賴性的毒，固然是因經濟的不獨立，沒有獨立的精神，同時他們還把很健全的身軀，故意裝成柳腰金蓮；把很含有自然美的臉孔，故意塗脂抹粉，以博男子們的歡心，這都是出於經濟不獨立的原因，但是另一方面却因伊們忘記自己們的地位，而願意把自己當做男子的玩具看待，於是才會那樣的受人欺侮，玩弄，或者給人看不起，這些這些，都是欠缺了對自己地位認識認的緣故。我們只要看；歷史上許多能够為國宣勞的婦女，那個不是以國家興亡匹夫有責的名訓拿來做自己的信條。伊們之所以有偉大的事業來表現，就因不輕自菲薄，而讓男子們去建立他們功績。在民國克上秋瑾女烈，伊就以革命為已任，所以才會為革命而生，同時也為革命而死。</p>
<p>總括的說，婦女們對於自己的地位如果沒有認識，那麼要求婦女們的經濟獨立，我相信，無論如何不會成功的，至多只能於口頭上增加一些時髦的口號，於事實絲毫沒有好處。好像我們中國的現代婦女，處在國家是這麽危急存亡的時候，我們應該都要認淸自己也是四萬萬人的一份子，大家都應該怎樣的為國家出力，而使國家得到了平等自由，再由國家方面而爭取我們的平等自由，這平等自由才是眞平等和眞自由了。有了眞平等和眞自由，然後經濟才會眞獨立。所以現代的婦女，决不可失却自己的地位，換句話說，婦女也是人，那麽人當然是有人格的。我希望現代婦女要認識自己的地位，保持自己的人格！</p>

<h3>現代職業婦女所受的迫害（上）</h3>
<p>— 李守眞</p>
<p>前天到一個朋友家裏去，談到彼此的生活狀况，她萬分憤慨的訴說着她這幾年來生活的無聊，本來她是一個受了高等敎育的人，可是自從結婚以後年年的生產剝奪了她的健康，而夫婦間意見的歧異，使她的精神又受到很大的打擊。</p>
<p>為了自己的不願依賴及充裕家庭的生計，她曾經幾次的和她丈夫商量，想到社會上去找工作，而她那由於五六年的戀愛而後結婚的丈夫，竟這樣的對她說：「不能，這是絕對不能的，我寗願一個人嚐盡了辛苦來維持這家庭，而不願你去求職業，老實告訴你，現在的社會，是男性中心的社會，假使一個女子要向社會上去有得一個位置，那就只求二個條件：　是已經和某部門的某一個男子有了一種可恥的妥協的，　是那個女子的某一點—學問與才能並不在內—是足够使男子們喜歡援助的，不然就根本不要去碰壁。再說得澈底一點，男子們的對於女子，是沒有一個人存着嚴正的心理的，假使你現在到社會上去找到了一個職業，那就是起碼有一個男子在對你不懷好意了。」她聽了這話，氣得什麽似的，和他很很的鬧了一塲，而當她轉吿我時，也就不禁怒火三丈！</p>
<p>可是當我們平心靜氣的來思考，來觀察一番，他這話與現在的一般情形有無相符的呢？不錯，完全以自己的力量來創造自己的地位的女子，並不是沒有，而完全靠自己的勞力來求自己的生活的女子也很多，可是像他所說的這種情形，確實也是不少。這就是現在一般女子職業的不能發達的原因，也就是現代職業婦女的一種迫害！</p>
<p>現在我們拿一般婦女所受到的迫害來說吧：</p>
<p>在上海一般茶館酒樓的女招待，其用意就完全在招攬生意，為什麽他們用女招待可以招攬生意呢？理由很簡單「因為她們是女子」這樣我們想本來是一個來求正當職業的淸白女子而在她們的僱主和那些顧客們的心中，是怎麽一回事呵，他們是以有人格的職業婦女來看待她們嗎？所以有志自立女子，她們要自立就得受辱，不然她們就不能自立</p>
<p>商店生意淸淡了，就可以用女店員來挽回，戲院要關門了，就用引導員來號召；他們是提高女權嗎？他們是給女子以職業嗎？他們不過是用一種一般無恥的觀念來吸引一般無聊而無恥的顧客罷了，這對於女子是如何的一種迫害呵！</p>
<h3>六十九歲的美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐寄塵</p>
<p>現在我寫的是一位六十九歲的女敎育家，伊名呌羅淑君，是美國人，到中國已經四十年，沒有嫁過丈夫，是獨身主義的實行者。伊說：活了六七十年，從未談過一次戀愛。在常州創辦了一所崇眞女校，最初是小學，現已添辦初中，成績斐然，得到社會廣大的信仰與崇敬。伊是基督敎徒，生平一切事業都是根據上帝的言行為依歸的，雖則「古稀」的年齡，但是有着一副健全的體魄，和明敏的頭腦，在咱們中國，像這樣年高望重的「老小姐」，恐怕是鳳毛麟角，不多見了吧。</p>
<p>在今年春間，伊感到自己慘淡經營的崇眞女學，還不能滿意；同時，伊校裏有許多職員，要酬答伊對於辦敎育的苦心，於是，就發起為羅小姐稱觴上壽，把賀儀移充興學基金，在紅帖子上老實不客氣地說：「倘蒙鼎惠隆義，卽請易贈法幣」。</p>
<p>當時的盛况，眞是轟動了整個的常州城。壽堂就設在校裏，十分華麗，四週懸掛着紅色的幔幛，中間桌子上供着一尊銀質的壽星，和中國人做壽同樣的格式。拜壽的嘉賓，十分之五是美國人，酒席却是中式，用筷用碗用匙，餐堂裏當日便平添不少笑料。</p>
<p>伊的態度是檢誠懇的，伊慣常操着一口流利的中國話，歡喜講伊自己的歷史，第一句便是：「我愛中國」。眞的，伊是把中國當作自己第二個「祖國」的。伊十三歲的時候，便想到中國來，可是伊家庭不允許，伊奮門，始終不懈地想實現伊的「中國夢」。結果，有志者事竟成，終於在二十八歲的一年到了中國。最初到松江，設聖經女塾，以拯救窮苦的學齡兒童和傳道為一生事業之中心。伊到常州的時候，那時內地極少外國人，於是一些頑皮的小孩，候羅小姐跑上了街，便跟隨着呌囂笑罵。天天可以聽到「洋鬼子」「猴猻」「夜又鬼」的罵聲！</p>
<p>伊說：「伊相信上帝，上帝敎伊來傳道，上帝敎伊來盡瘁敎育，上帝敎伊來吃苦」所以伊雖感到煩悶，然而勝利光榮在伊前途閃爍，在煩悶裏永遠展開着笑臉。因此伊只有大眾，忘記了自己，到中國四十年，沒有半點積蓄，伊是一位「白手成家」的創造者，伊運用伊的腦和手開拓了一塊荒地，播下了種子，於是才造成今日「桃李盈門」的現象。在這四十年裏，不獨伊的精神使人欽佩，同時伊偉大的道德和純潔的人格，也留給人們一個良好的印象。</p>
<p>初期的崇眞女校，是三間平房，地位旣狹小，空氣又不流通，沉重僅有二三十人，唯一的兒女到「洋鬼子」的學堂裏去。然而伊並不灰心，依舊埋頭向前幹。中期的崇眞遷移新址，三幢小洋房，凡學校必需的設備，都一應俱全，沉重也增加了許多。現在已經由完全小學進而添設初中，校舍全新，生氣蓬勃！我們一方面慶祝伊的成功，一方面還企待伊將來有更大的發展。</p>
<p>我們感覺到，肯犧牲自己。為着社會，為着或種的事業，而坦白地，轟轟烈烈地挺着身子向前幹的，試問能有幾人？跑進社會圈的婦女們應該怎樣？</p>

<h3>娼妓的慘痛</h3>
<p>— 丁笑如</p>
<p>—為「賽金花死」有感而作—</p>
<p>娼妓—大眾的「妻」，大眾的「情婦」！</p>
<p>她們打扮得「花枝招展」，她們出賣「靑春」。</p>
<p>她們咽住自己的「悲淚」，祇顧求人家的「歡樂」</p>
<p>她們把自己當做「羔羊」，常供餓虎的「蹂躪」與「宰割」。</p>
<p>她們「性」的感覺麻痺，「廉恥」的觀念消滅，她們「飢餓」的感覺，却特別敏銳。</p>
<p>她們代人解决「性」的飢渴，來解决自己腹中的飢餓。</p>
<p>她們拿皮肉換來的錢，祇能供鴇媽的揮霍，她們自身的生活，還不如一頭狗。</p>
<p>她們眼中的所謂「光明」，祇是法幣，白的飯粒，和晶瑩的淚珠。</p>
<p>她們給予「孤獨者」無上的「慰安」與「狂歡」。</p>
<p>她們給予從不知道「溫柔滋味」的人以無限的「溫柔」的快慰。</p>
<p>她們使「婚姻不如意」的人，得到許多滿足。</p>
<p>她們能使「慳吝」的人，變為「慷慨」，「作惡」的人，改行「慈善」的事業。</p>
<p>她們經過不少的傳染上「繁華」，也受盡任何「侮辱」</p>
<p>她們真實被人傳染上「惡病」，把身體弄壞，後來反因此遭人的「咒罵」。</p>
<p>她們常被人當做一塊「譏誚」和「謾罵」的招牌。</p>
<p>她們不知道自己是處於社會上何種地位，大槪「人」與「畜」之間吧？</p>
<p>可是事實上她們也是「人」，她們也是目今所謂「女性優先」時代的和那些被男子所推崇的一樣的「女人」。</p>
<p>她們的結果，多半是「冷淸淸地」死在一間狹小的黑屋子裏，赤身或祇鴉雀去啄，野狗去拖。這班可咀咒的可憐的而又可敬（？）的—特殊的女人呵！</p>
<h3>私人秘書（上）</h3>
<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>紹宜在隔夜和伊老父為了出洋不出洋的問題大大的爭吵了一塲之後，今天紹文要拉伊一起去看腦門希拉的「閨怨」，伊也堅執着不肯祇是一個人沒精打采地在家裏坐着，後來實在悶得無法，便檢齊了當天的一份申報，從頭至屋的看下去。看是看得眞仔細了，連廣吿也沒有放過，因此就給伊發現了一條很使伊覺得有些心動的小吿白。那吿白上說：</p>
<p>「徵聘私人秘書一人，以女性為限。須由大學文科畢業或肄業在兩年以上者。待遇初月薪九十元，以後逐年遞加。每日工作五小時。請先至××律師事務所繳納相片，報吿候試」。</p>
<p>月薪九十元，雖不是怎樣大的一筆數目，可是像紹宜這樣一個只須自己添添衣服，充充零用，不必顧家的小康人家之女，却早就很滿意了，而尤其使伊滿意的是每日只須工作五小時？現在普通一般機關的工作動不動七小時，八小時，像伊這樣一位大小姐怎能幹得了呢？伊爸爸昨天說：「出洋？你知道要多少錢？你們自己不曾賺過錢那裏知道錢的難處！」這幾句話是很使伊　心的，因此伊决意自己去賺幾個錢，來給爸爸瞧瞧。</p>
<p>拍照，報名，居然都辦好了，後來人家就有信來約伊去面談；伊因為生恐事情不成，鬧成笑話，便大着膽一個人闖去，連伊妹妹紹文也沒有知道。那接洽塲合雖是一位律師的事務所，可是實際上和伊接洽的那個人却不是律師。他說要聘私人秘書的是他，只因他和律師是朋友，所以借他那裏做個通信處。這倒不必管他，可是他究竟幹的什麽行業呢？為什麽要需用私人秘書呢？而且為什麽原因必須要用女性的私人秘書四？這些情形，實在是都應該仔細問一問的，可是對於社會的深處尚無如何認識的紹宜，怎麽敢向一個自己心目中的未來的僱主如此追究呢！便讓那個傢伙自動的胡亂吿訴了伊一些：姓吳，是一個研究文學的英國留學生，近想辦一種文藝刋物，希望伊能够帮助他譯些東西。事情但這樣决定了。</p>
<p>第三天，紹宜開始工作了，那個姓吳的文學家就在某一所大厦裏租了一間斗大的辦公室，掛上「新月雜誌部」的招牌，很得意地編起他的雜誌了。當紹宜在開始工作後的第一天回去時，收上似乎略有一些不安。第一是新月雜誌部的職員祇有伊和那姓吳的兩個人，還有一個時常差出去的小孩子，祇剩他們一男一女對坐在裏面，空氣似乎有些異樣；第二是那性吳的人待伊太好了，一些沒有架子，寫字檯面對面的排着，一爭用具都很精緻，而且還在一個壁架上備着許多水菒和市價的咖啡糖，很誠懇地不斷的送上來請伊吃，工作到中午又請出去同進西餐，回家又派汽車專送，簡直像招待一個客人一樣；第二是非但伊自己沒有做過一些工作，就是那性吳的也未見動過一次筆。這種：未免太神秘了，幾乎紹宜一夜天沒有睡着。可是第二天又有更神秘的事實發現了，當八點半鐘時候，伊才走出家門，就見那性吳的人汽車夫在外面候著了，伊當然也不能推讓，便上了車。這還不算，中午那姓吳的又極誠懇地欵待了一次中餐，午後將到四點鐘，那小孩子又買來了兩張樓廳座的影戲票。接下去便是看影戲，吃夜飯，開汽車送伊回家。</p>
<h3>記民族女英雄瓦氏</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>巾幗英雄，在歷史上幾指不勝數，而為國家與民族爭生存的，除了梁紅玉與秦良玉，曾有一個很光榮的記載外，就少有聞見，這裏所記的田州女士官瓦氏，雖無上述梁秦之膾炙人口，可是當時殺敵的痛快淋漓，在我們江浙沿海一帶，至今仍是留有一個不可磨滅的印象的。</p>
<p>當明朝嘉靖十四年，東南沿海，倭寇大舉來侵，那時國內承平已久，武備不修，守兵節節退讓，竟給打進內地，如今之蘇嘉路沿綫，更是給蹂躪得人民離散，廬舍為壚！幾為之盤踞為大本營，那時，田州女士官瓦氏以敢戰著，朝廷乃調征倭寇，瓦氏僅率兒狼兵千人，問道來援，至之日，索有司大捕蛇以為食糧，與官軍夾擊倭寇於王江涇與吳江北坼之間，大敗之，斬首二千餘級，倭寇精銳，幾盡殲焉，積尸盈野，狼兵每有臘其肉與蛇共食者，一時人心大快，當時民間流行有一支很雄壯的詩謠道：「花瓦家，能殺倭，臘而啖之有如蛇。」就是歌詠這回事的。</p>

<h3>蘇曾祥博士談女權與女能</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>有女能便有女權，爭女權不如爭人權；　能自立纔能治家，理內政不忘救國家。</p>
<p>婦女運動最終的目標，一般人總以為是爭「女權」好像說數千年來女子的權，都給男子剝奪盡了，現在法律規定男女平權，女子有解放的機會，便該爭回已失的女權。其實這是偏見，不是正論。男女同是人類，應無分彼此，大家要爭得「人權」；再擴大些說，我們整個的中華民族，近百年來，受盡外族的欺凌侮辱，在此大難當前，應該一致起來，爭中華民族的解放與自由；所以男女之間，除共同奮門之外，不該有什麽爾我之分的。現在婦女界中同情這意見的很多，蘇曾祥博士，也是其中之一。她原籍崇明，曾留學德奧兩國，專研小兒科，並考察歐洲各國最新保育諸方法，去年繼回國。現除診務外，並担任現代父母月刋衛生顧問，為全國父母義務答各項關於兒童健康的疑難問題，這是一椿極重要的極有意義的工作，前天我到靜安寺新華園她的診所，談了一嘴里的話，下面便是她主要的意見。</p>
<p>『我平素不願計男女平權這一套話，我想憑空講「女權」，未必不實效，只要守本分，盡智能，實事求是，她就有女權可享。要爭「女權」，必先有「女能」，必有「女權」。凡女子有一技之長，便是「女能」，卽處理家政，也是女能之一。你旣有了「能」，不爭也有「權」；倘使你沒有能，卽爭得「權」，也是暫時而不可久享的。推而廣之，有能力的女子，應該求「人權」，不必斤斤於「女權」的爭奪。以前曾聽得希特勒說：「女子要則到家庭去！」他的意思，好像全部回家去，我以為太武斷了。有些女子，正在社會上做着實際的工作，難道也要放棄了，而掉頭不幹麽？這話限於某種家庭，是很需要的，不過女子不能太過注重社會服務，家政幹得好，也一樣有功於人羣；古人說「齊家治國平天下」，家庭是社會組織的細胞，當然不能忽視，故我主張男子以事業為重，而女子應以家庭為重』</p>
<p>『現在一般婦女對於家庭之主，育兒常識，眞的太缺乏了，我以為女子中學，除規定家政學科外，應加授兒童保健常識，因為女子獨身的究屬少數，旣然人人要嫁，而且要生子女，當然需要研究。兒童保健一科，卽失學的女子，在識字學校裏，也當授以此種常識；兒童為未來的主人翁，怎麽可以忽略呢？根據我過去醫療的經騐，覺得大多數主婦，因缺乏家庭衛生常識，致自身及兒童感受精神與特質兩重損失，負敎育之責者，應該設法補救的。其次，一般女太太們，沒有閱書年報的素養，雖然每日為工作所限制，一方面也可以說自己放棄求智慾，否則無論如何忙，至少每天可抽出一小時自修的功夫。嘗讀西洋某雜誌說：小孩生三月後，母親喂乳時，可以看得五頁書，可見她們勤讀的一斑。要是在中國的主婦，喂乳時正可抽一枝烟，或打一副牌，眞的，不一定是笑話。』</p>
<p>我又問她自綏遠勦匪，時局嚴重以後，婦女界應負何種責任？她說：「國難至此，未來局勢，或將更見緊張，婦女應努力後方工作，例如：　加重家庭責任，—如啟發兒童愛國思想，鼓勵丈夫救國精神，　研習看護及救護學術；　增進防空毒的智識；　節省家庭開支，捐助國防之用；　有時參加募捐陰及前方將士慰勞隊；　為將士製征衣，—如手套，耳袋，絲綿馬甲等。惟恐我婦女界體格太差，不能任勞任怨，有平時過慣享樂生活，事事假手婢傭，到戰時不知將何以應付？總之我們現在必須及早準備，卽使大難臨頭，决不心慌意亂。像我個人便抱定此旨，一旦有出動命令我必趕上征塵，義無反顧，為國捐軀，實為人生最光榮的歸宿」！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>不愛江山愛美人</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>英王愛德華八世，與辛柏生夫人結婚問題，醞釀多日，致引起政局的不安，至昨日始宣布英王愛德華八世遜位，仲弟約克公爵繼承皇位，這是英王與辛柏生婦人結婚問題，鬧了許久，總算告了一個段落。</p>
<p>我國本有不愛江山愛美人的名句，但是我國眞正能不愛江山而愛美人的，是在少數，卽如唐明皇之對於楊貴妃，總算寵愛極了，但是到了馬崽坡的時候，也只有不愛美人而愛江山，現在像英皇愛德華八世的堅絕不屈態度，情願犧牲皇位，不顧放棄美人，這樣態度，不但我國歷史上所無，抑亦各國歷史上所未之見，不能不說是開天闢地第一件大風流案。</p>
<p>其實拆穿東洋鏡說，人生幾何，貴且行樂，像英王愛德華之高據皇位，安富尊榮，在旁人觀之，必定是十分寫意，二十分羡慕，但在英王處置，月決不感覺到若何興味，英國是一個責任內閣制度的國家，君權之力量甚微，卽使以辛柏生夫人一事言之，已深覺不能自由之痛苦，故英皇寗願精神上得到愉快，而不願形式上得到舒服，情願形式上受些委屈，決不願精神受到痛楚。</p>
<p>語曰，易求無價寳，難得有情人，又曰千金難買一笑，若此物茍爲我人所喜悅，不惜任何犧牲，定欲羅致，人情大抵如此，不過英王艾德華情願犧牲皇位，而不願犧牲美人，旁觀者每惜其代價之太鉅，天下固多美婦人力何必如是，但此說僅對於未陷情網這說也，若已入情網，而欲擺脫，原非易事。</p>
<p>因此我甚感覺英皇安德海堅絕不屈之精神，殊不可及業，彼對於辛柏生夫人結婚之約，信誓旦旦，決不失信，而情願犧牲皇位，以踐約言，於此亦更見英王人格致可貴，皇位可以　屣，而約言決不寒盟，如此人格，何可多得，或者以辛夫人三醮之說疑慮之，則固是各人目光之不同矣。</p>
<h3>樓</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>小時候，我是十分渴望着一座樓，一座可以使我登臨的樓。鄉下的市集上是沒有樓的，商店中的店屋的天面上，雖則可以堆些東西，但是沒有窗，爬進去黑黑的不會使人有登樓的感覺。</p>
<p>背着母親我有時爬到倚着屋簷上的木梯上去。懷着虛怯的心，向四邊望去，攢簇着的房屋，形成了瓦的海。夕陽光抹着成了金色的鱗紋，使人想起映着夕陽的春水的漣漪。在瓦的海中，更可以看到一些各種各樣的樹頭：楊柳的瀟灑的丰姿，枇杷的沉鬱的氣派，特別是槐葉他使人想起春水裏的浮萍。</p>
<p>有時我更仰起頭來，明藍的天似乎蓋着屋頂，不遠輕盈的白雲幾乎擦着鼻尖掠過，於是我更想起一座樓來。</p>
<p>不一定等到母親的尋找，我是悄然的走下梯來。於是我又在一道很高的牆的包圍着的天井中，渡過着漫長的下午。我細心的尋找着牆陰的小草，耐心的調撥着螞蟻的戰爭，但是我沒有忘了一座可以供我登臨的樓。</p>
<p>於是我又仰起頭來，小小的白雲，飛得很快，一顆心，隨着白雲，飛到抹着夕陽的瓦的海中了。</p>
<p>離開家鄕後，我經常的生活在樓上，但是我只有幾决眞正感到「樓」的存在，和自己是眞的登了樓。</p>
<p>是三年前的暮春，我一個人飄到了蘇州，時間已經薄暮我帶着旅愁走上了酒家樓。</p>
<p>樓是向西的，斜陽倒着欄杆影，使人淸楚的看到韶華的過去。酒樓的對面是一片垂楊，牠著了三月的新裝，把長條直垂到地面，因爲暮烟四起，使柳絲格外的朦朧。</p>
<p>我倚着危欄，無言悵望，柳絲中的殷紅的落日，儘依依的不肯下去，夕陽烟柳外，一髮靑山，像夢裏的長眉，把眉梢淡入暮烟中。</p>
<p>一片市聲，隨着晚風，直捲過來，我開始感到身在異鄕。「休提別話，今宵宿在誰家？　我反復吟咏，一隻手在欄杆上輕輕的拍着。</p>
<p>夕陽終於下去了，暮色格外的濃厚，不知道近處什麼地方的兵營中歸隊號都都的吹着。</p>
<p>路燈閃爍的亮了，樓下一連幾輛馬車水一般的流去。</p>
<p>就是那一年的秋天，我一個人又到了一個江邊小鎭，這並不是我的目的地，因爲下雨我就半途中打住了。小鎭上一共有四五百家人家，我寄居的是市梢頭一所唯一的高樓上。</p>
<p>雨下得不大，但是非常平勻，整整五六小時沒有一點間息的時期。因爲明天要奔向另一個地方，這暫時的一宿，釀成我酒一樣的旅愁。</p>
<p>小鎭離開江濱還有一二里路，但是在樓頭，我望得長江了。雨是異樣的朦朧，使長江成了灰白的一片，本來應該看得很淸楚的隔江雲樹，這時候也成了灰黑的一片了。</p>
<p>有時候江中有黑色的風帆劃過，但是因爲雨鄭重得使人感到十分費力，我好像覺得自己坐在一隻小船上，在這暮雨的秋江上，沿着江邊，由幾個舟子吃力的撑着前進。於是本來濃厚的旅愁，就像鉛塊一樣的壓在心上。</p>
<p>夜了，雨還是耐心的下着，我只是倚着樓窗。</p>
<p>市集是一片黑，秋江上也是一片黑，但我分明地覺得自己的站在一座最高樓上，「金陵徑渡小山樓，一宿行人自可愁！」我又想起了誰入的詩句。</p>
<h3>吹鼓手</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>平九賡沒有享過黃金的童年！</p>
<p>他那顆天眞的童心，是給爹爹把握在手掌裏，終天他老像有大量訴說不盡的苦衷留在心葉上似的，蹙緊了愁眉，過着非常沉悶的日子。</p>
<p>是春天呵！他只有眼看着一羣羣孩子，在綠色的草原上，打滾，跌扑，或是在隔壁那所學堂裏念書，習字，唱着自由的歌曲……他總是歎歎氣，背人紅着眼！</p>
<p>爹爹是一個彎轉了腰脊的老年人，一張猴兒的臉上，凸出兩個非常獰人的眼睛，他還有古老的脾氣，時常拿出來對付自己孩子，不許做孩子的撤野，荒唐……要是偶爾九賡的腿子一癢，跑出步門，或是溜到隔壁學堂裏聽一點書聲，老頭子的便毫不容情地高高地罵：</p>
<p>「小雜種！沒出息的，……快進來做功課！」</p>
<p>一聽到罵聲，便馴服地坐在黯幽的牆角裏，扭轉頸項，噓唎噓唎地習練着這管要命的不滿二尺長短的竹笛，那怕是熱天，汗流挾背，或是隆冬的季節，十個指尖凍得氷僵，爹爹也不許他稍些曠廢的。</p>
<p>老年人自有他的經騐之談；說是練出一副好身手，先要從苦難裏磨練那管笛子，將來可以繼承他的一輩子送人家終的吹鼓手生涯。</p>
<p>一年了！受爹爹的强制，九賡已把那些「工尺」隻隻背得爛熟，現在竟獨自會吹一個「天下同」（一），吹來也像模像樣了。</p>
<p>爹爹的自然開心得了不起！時常替他附和着笛聲，上腔（二），拍板子，甚至有時興奮得跳蹦着二條瘦得要命的腿子</p>
<p>在人前，他是時常誇耀着自己那個能掙氣的孩子：</p>
<p>「嘿嘿！我們九賡眞長成呵！……你們想，這年頭兒種田人多苦！年成又那麼捉摸不住……所以我讓孩子學這門祖業，將來我是有了靠傍的啊！……」</p>
<p>往往然人家對於他那套說話，總是表示同一的：點點頭兒，或者讚美幾聲做爹爹的見解的不差。——那是多麼使老頭子滿足而又愉快啊！</p>
<p>可是這話有一决居然碰了壁，引起了一個人表示不滿。——對方的人，是鄉村小學的靑年教授兪先生。</p>
<p>是夏夜一個納凉的晚上，那位兪先生挾着書本子，在前的曠塲上，非常正經地當面對他說：</p>
<p>「你們九賡很聰明啊！像那樣的孩子，很可以念幾年書，讓他增進點智識，將來到……」</p>
<p>「嗯嗯！先生！要活命啊！這份祖業也不是容易接得上的！」老年人不等人說完，便搶嘴上來。</p>
<p>對方人歎了一口氣：</p>
<p>「我以爲學齡時期的孩子，無論給生活怎樣重壓？總需要灌渝他一點智識？……」</p>
<p>「……那像我不識一個字，不念一本書——也混了半輩子啊！」</p>
<p>回話的馬上把臉子一沉，似乎不快</p>
<p>「以前是以前的社會啊！但是今後呢，我敢說不受教育是不能生存的。」</p>

<p>靈樞素問</p>
<p>— 劉馨柏醫師主答</p>
<p>梅毒未痊</p>
<p>第一二七號，王美娟女士問：敝人曾患梅毒，並生扁平濕疣，後見先生答覆，依法治療，不日全愈。在事前曾患右肩騰痛，亦經某醫師抽血檢查注射六〇六而愈。現在一切如常，只有喉頭不時痛疼。請問（一）是否前病未愈？病名？（二）如是前病未愈，如何要哈斷根？（三）要否繼續注射六〇六？</p>
<p>答：（一）是，是喉頭梅毒。（二）注射六〇六六針，『尅爾梅星』（Carbisin）打，騐血一次，如無毒，到半年後再騐一次，如有毒，再如前注射。（三）見（二）。</p>
<p>是否白濁</p>
<p>第一二八號，李希時君問：敝人偶與妓女交姤。翌日覺小便刺痛，又二日，小便中有白膿，痛疼難忍，請問（一）是否白濁？（二）最有效之療法？（三）如何預防使不變為梅毒，睪丸炎？（四）何時可算痊愈？</p>
<p>答：（一）是。（二）注射『果能克淋』（Sino-Acrindin）　十針後。『用蛋白化銀』（Argent　Proteinate）一％冲洗。自始至終服『淸濁便』（　Citropin）不許間斷。（三）梅毒非由白濁轉變來，無法預防。經以上療法，冲洗時再加以特別注意，已可避免睪丸炎之危險。（四）請衛生機關檢尿，他檢完了給你一張證明，你看上面的“Gonococcus”項下不是（十）字，而是（一）字，那你就算好了。</p>
<p>盲腸炎之背痛</p>
<p>第一二九號，法租界南成都路貝禘鏖路貝禘坊九號，程車揚君問：敝人現年二十一歲，住居法租界。在四年前曾患盲腸炎。在上海衛生療養分院照X光後，據醫生說是慢性盲腸炎。旋在腹部右面施行手術，剖出小腸約半寸許長一條。此腸結硬如石。住院兩月，身體漸趨常態。不過精神不能復原，而背脊仍然感覺倦乏痠痛。這病迄今已經四年了，背骨之苦楚，仍絲毫未减。故現在奉函懇求，給與答覆：（一）此症有無轉變危險？（二）治法如何？（三）應服何藥？</p>
<p>答：盲腸炎頗易復發，此外有無腎石疝及腎孟炎，在在都須檢查。檢查盲腸炎單靠臨床病狀已足；腎石疝還靠X光及騐尿，腎孟炎亦須檢騐。故閣下現是何病，不診査尚無法决定。治療更須待診斷確實之後。</p>
<p>慢性淋病及其他</p>
<p>第三十號，浦東高橋大同路市立虹廟小學江虹君問：（一）自療慢性淋病，以保藥為有效（如淋毒丸，尅淋濃，滅殺淋，樂的能，的立平梅毒尅星等）？（二）報載各花柳病院之『十元包醫，限期斷根，不醫還洋』等，是否可靠？（三）　醫師處醫治此病，大約需費若干？需時幾日？（四）陰莖短小，早洩等，除了溫水每日摩擦外，用何藥補救？市上發售之維他賜保命，還爾童，壽爾康，鹿茸精等，是否有效？（五）有時覺骨節內酸痛，是否為淋濁性關節炎？（六）身體瘦長，思服壯健劑，使肌肉發達，豐肥，用何藥有效？（七）上海產婦科醫院，以何家為良，而費用稍廉？</p>
<p>答：（一）以用『蛋白化銀』（Argent　Albrminate）冲洗為最效。來函所詢諸藥旣不明其成分，又未經試騐，在國內外之醫學雜誌上又從未見其文獻，故無從批評。（二）醫師公會對不道德之廣吿，無資格之醫生，正謀取締。但敝人則不願在此批評。（三）慢性淋病如治療適當一個月左右小便已淸，五十日後，尿中細菌能完全消滅。（四）陰莖之畸形，現在外科學尚無矯正之方法。『維他賜保命』是『荷爾蒙製劑』，治療早洩有效。以下三種藥品成分不明。『鹿茸精』是何物？鹿茸是否含有動物鹼（精）尚待研究。（五）不是。『淋濁性關節炎』無如此便當。（六）『魚肝油』可服，但只能使人『豐肥』，並不能使人『肌肉發達』。肌肉發達專靠運動。（七）中德產科醫院，同德產科醫院，均屬上海負有盛名之醫院。私人醫師之有名者，有瞿紹衡醫師。</p>
<p>咳嗽胸痛</p>
<p>第三十一號，上海同孚路三一六弄一號，姜士澹君問：茲有友人李君，因近日時感不適，特委敝人前來詢問間。據李君謂，彼父於數年前患肺結核死亡，今春其兄亦患同症死亡。李君則約自月前患感冒，終日鼻涕極多，咳嗆亦頗烈，胸部有時覺隱隱作痛。曾前往受X光檢查，診查結果謂：『右肺角不明，左右肺影門稍大』。後又將吐出之痰少許前往檢騐，報吿謂：『痰呈鹼性反應』，內含白血球極多，及表皮細胞，瓶狀細胞各少許，並有少數之『加答性球菌』（Micrococcus　Catarrh）。今歲體重略减輕，面色黃瘦，甚為憔粹。日來曾服司各脫魚肝油數瓶，未見有效。近數日胸部時作痛，精神不佳，並感不適。茲有數問，祈詳為解答：（一）疾中白血球極多是何現象？　『加答性球菌』為何種疾病所應有？（三）根據騐疾所得可斷為何病？（三）該病用何藥治之？（五）易治否？（六）何謂肺角不明，是何現象？（七）何謂肺門影穢天？（八）有無肺結核之現象或可疑點？（九）若為肺結核，何藥治之？（十）服魚肝油以潤肺有效否？</p>
<p>答：（一）呼吸氣道之炎症。（二）流行性感冒，急性氣管枝炎，加答兒性肺炎，分泌物中均有之。（三）騐痰所得似係氣管枝炎，X光檢查，確有結核嫌疑。（四）服『咳利舒開』（Kresocal）。（五）尚易。（六）該部有炎症或結核之現象。（七）肺門部結核之現象。（八）有。（九）療法頗多，藥法療法中可異者有鈣療法，如注射『鈣固神』（Calchosen），內服『新亞鈣劑』（Sinocalcin）。（十）魚肝油之效非在潤肺。魚肝油有極高之營養價，可補償人患結核病時之較大的體力消費。維持人之體力，以與結核菌相對抗</p>
<p>小粒奇癢</p>
<p>第三十二號，高昌廟，海容軍艦上，歐陽昭君問：敝人男性，年二十五歲，身體健全。於前二年得皮膚病，去冬稍减，未全愈，今秋復起。其形小粒有白液，午晚飯後及喫有刺激或熱燥食物則更奇癢。扒之卽連皮破爛，一二日後可愈。現已傳遍全身，經搽塗中法九一四，太和六〇六及各種藥膏。且每隔二三日卽以藥皂洗滌一次。惟此處治愈他部又起，此瘥彼發，循環不已。敝人想定係『血燥』，『濕熱』或『血液不淸』。擬請貴醫師指示療法：（一）應否騐血？（二）注射何種淸血針並數量？（三）購××出品之××氏六〇六藥水可服否？（四）此病對於身體有碍否？</p>
<p>答：（一）無梅毒症状，亦無其他與血液疾病有關之症狀，故不必騐血。（二）注射『加耳的靈』（Caloylen）二打，用『一〇%秘魯樹漿醑』（10%Spiritrs　Balsan　Peru）擦。（三）『六〇六』內服，於學理無據，效力不少可疑處。（四）當然有害。</p>
<p>瘧後痞塊</p>
<p>第三十三號，前人問：再懇者，舍弟年十八歲。於前數年患瘧疾愈後，而腹部左邊結一硬塊。現已至如小碗底大。睡時以手按之可動移，頗痛。據聞係痞塊。經中西醫診治未見瘥减。舍弟身體非常瘦弱，且多病，想與此痞定有關係（病時此痞則略大。（一）應否開刀，或服藥使之消化？（二）是何病？（三）對日常食物應否禁忌？（四）懇請貴醫師示詳細療法！</p>
<p>答：主治點『驅瘧』，『去痞』，『補血』。『驅瘧』用『奎寗劑』用『砒劑』，『去痞』用『砒劑』，『補血』用『肝膏劑』。『奎寗製劑』有『福白龍糖衣片』，『砒劑』有『矯基鈉』，『肝膏劑』有『利凡命』。故此三者—『福白龍糖衣片』（Febnon　Tab.　Sugar　Caated），『矯基鈉』（Sod　Cacddylate）『利凡命』（Livemin）—或內服，或注射，均不可或缺。（二）『慢性瘧性脾腫』，（三）尚無。（四）無效者，並無『血胡病』者，須用外科割除術。</p>
<p>痰中帶血</p>
<p>第三十四號，北京路福興里十四號，恒和祥綢荘張建中君問：敝人體質殘弱，日常多痰，而以冬日為甚。此種頑疾，　綿已有二載：今屆冬令，又復增劇。茲將病狀列下：每日晨起，疾聲瀌瀌，滯於喉中，頗覺難堪，如有梗在喉，不吐不快。吐時頗覺費力，必作强烈之呼吸，始得隨口而出。惟吐出之痰量不多，時或圓圓數點；色灰黑，膩而濃；時或嵌有殷紅之血點，狀甚可怖，觸目驚心。但日常並不咳嗽，飲食如恒，辦事精力並不减退。胸部時或隱隱作痛，身體消瘦而已。近日購服淸魚肝油，但咯痰未見遞减。惟恐长此以往，病日益深，难以治療。故特具函。请问：（一）是否肺病？（二）应如何治療？</p>
<p>答：（一）是。（二）『鱼肝油』照舊服，另外服『咳利舒開』（Kresocal），並請醫院注射『鈣固神』（Calchosen），前者去咳，跡近治標，後者治本，包圍病灶</p>
<p>俞先生斬釘截鐵地說完那話，又望着他們父子，—九賡是把頭向着闊野的天邊。</p>
<p>然而老年人滿腔呆板的意旨，仍舊固執着，對這話絲毫沒有覺得。</p>
<p>「我是不希望孩子熟讀書經，比我老子了不起啊！…」</p>
<p>他憤憤地咕嚕了一陣，伴隨着孩子望陰翳的小屋裏躥了進去。</p>
<p>之後，在白天或晚夜，老人家照例督率自己孩子習練那管笛子，反而比從前更嚴切了！</p>
<p>孩子九賡呢，正似一隻被領導之下的猴子啊！愁雲佔據在他的胸膛裏，他的生活更感到比以前沉悶了，眉心理蹙得緊着了。</p>
<p>不过他一颗天眞的童心，仍旧保持着原有的想念，他並沒有因着剝削，放棄了上進的意志。在白夜，當明亮的月光照着空漠的曠郊的時候，他是時常呆巴巴地抱着那支爹爹視為唯物的竹笛，靠坐在門口，眼睛朝望着四野，揮灑着眼眶裏孕着的淚水。</p>
<p>有時，還趁爹爹上街去了的時候，偷偷地跑到隔壁學堂裏，聽人家念書的聲音，和那些自由的歌曲！…</p>
<p>註　「天下同」：是一隻笛譜中流行的曲子，舊式結婚中新人交拜的時候，是那個曲子來附和的。</p>
<p>上腔：是吹鼓手業的切口，就是敎授曲譜的意思。</p>
<h3>冬天的晚上</h3>
<p>— 羅雲華</p>
<p>徐家匯底位西南角的頭髪樣濃密的樹叢裏，他看不到上海，因為他不是眼睛，他只能靜靜地聽着繁華的上第發出來的燥音。二路電車，不斷地把動的上海底消息帶過來，或者把徐家匯底消息帶回去，用他那平穩得顯得笨拙的體驅。</p>
<p>實在說，這地方是可愛的，在夏天，雖然蚊子多，熱浪好像給樹林擋住了，只有知了底漫長的曲子跟二路電車所特有的優美的響聲纏綿地蕩漾在那平靜的空氣裏。</p>
<p>住在這地方，如果沒有什麽事情煩擾你，或者，你想拋開一切社會上的事，作一點讀書寫作的事，那是再好也沒有的。</p>
<p>在一九三五年冬天，我因為生活上的需要，像省房錢等等原因，就跑到那兒去住了。住在一間闊大的前樓，面向着太陽，早晨還沒起床，甚或還沒有醒，陽光就溫暖地給加了一層沒有重量的棉被，光綫自然是充足的，沒有什麽都市底煤灰雜着的從原野裏吹過來的風，輕輕地和室裏的空氣交流着。</p>
<p>我適宜地過着這種半鄕村式的生活。雖然感到很大的寂寞底重壓。</p>
<p>尤其是在初冬，像這幾天的不怎麽寒冷的天氣，在吃過晚飯以後，那種充滿了村鎭風味的生活，給我了莫大的興趣。</p>
<p>你喜歡吃酒吧？少吃一點兒暖暖心是好的，當你從街上回來，而曾被風吹襲的時候。買一點酒，一包花生米，都是便宜而美好的貨色。可以一面看着晚報，一邊喝着，當然，頂好是有一位知心的朋友坐在你對過，一邊回憶着風趣的往事，或者講些剛看過書，剛聽到的事，都是再好不過的。</p>
<p>那時，你只能聽到電車走過的悠長而美麗的音韻。</p>
<p>如果外面沒有風，沿着虹橋路，往萬國公墓去的路上，電燈光稀疏地照耀着，只在路當中才有的一條柏油路面，放着堅誠的光茫。也許是冬天又是晚上的緣故，路被凍得凝聚得更結實了，皮鞋走過的響聲，有力的鼓動着四周空曠的野地。</p>
<p>你一個人，沿着修整的菜畦，那發軟的鬆散的土地中間的一條硬埂，慢慢地散步吧，低低地唱着你自己愛好的曲子，把自己悲歡喜樂的情感向廣大的田野噴吐吧，他有一張無比的偉闊的胸懷，可以接受你底的一般的。</p>
<p>或者，你就站在那兒，向躺在徐家匯底身後的上海望一望吧，那時，我記得，有一次，我站在經過徐家匯的滬杭甬鐵路的一邊，前面就是鐵路，電燈光微弱地照耀着，只有一點反光的路軌，橫臥在灰色的枕土上，好像一個不抵抗主義者的奴才一樣等待着車底重壓。兩邊是田野，跟藏在樹叢裏的別墅。前望，就是正開始夜生活的輕狂地跳躍着的都市：天空被電紅燈燃燒得成了不自然的紅色，好像好好的畫布上塗了層沒有調勻的舊顏料。汽車底燈光，探海燈似地掃射過來，房屋樹木底輪廓很快地一現就重新消失在黑暗裏了。自己底臉也亮了一亮，眼睛害羞似地躱避着。然而，你只能看到這些光跌影，聲是聽不到的，就是不多遠的電車底響聲也聽不到，只有幾個農人或同文學院的沉重在工作或散步。</p>
<p>你或我，或者任何一個人，在這兒站着，都好像是跟世界隔絕了一樣，然而，常常有一種感覺，就是上海是一個患了憂鬱病的傢伙，而徐家匯還是健康的。雖然，如果仔細想一下，這是不十分正確的話語。</p>
<p>每天晚上，我跑到野外去看着，都市的光影。直等夜風起來了，或者落雨了，才回來。</p>
<p>然而，我沒有能够多住下去，上海好像一塊磁石，我就是一粒鐵屑，那磁石吸引力是强烈的，因為那裏有我底伙件，我就被吸引回來了，跟鐵屑們擠在一起。</p>
<p>不過，我還追念着這冬天的晚上的幾個月的情景，向他送着高度的愛慕。我希望有一天，當我們底文化休息公園開闢的時候，選定這可愛的地方，讓我們能安心地享愛自然底擁抱，呼吸那沒有煤烟味的香甜的空氣。</p>

<h3>再為藝華公司進一言</h3>
<p>我們很高興，我們的一點愚直之見，已　得　了藝華影業公司的答覆：同時，我們也很失望，因為藝華公司給我們的答覆，顯然沒有了解我們的意思。</p>
<p>為了愛護藝華公司，更為了愛護中國電影事業，我們　秉了一片熱忱向藝華公司提出忠吿，凡是讀過那篇「敬吿」書的，我們相信誰都可以看出其中的誠意，現在這「一片熱忱」，竟被曲解為「惡意漫罵」，這實在不能不便人十分遺憾。為了息事，我們原可以無言，但，是否接受輿論的忠吿，雖是藝華公司的權利，我們却仍然有對電影界貢獻愚見的義務，因此也仍然願意來一下不必要的答覆。</p>
<p>藝華公司自「花燭之夜」之後的幾部作品，在客觀上給與觀眾的影響是什麽？這是「全國電影觀眾可以公正無私之立塲」來「判明」，當時我們也曾在各報發表過詳細的批評，不必再來多所嘵舌，這次藝華公司答覆中所列舉各片的主題說明，文字上看來雖似有充分理由，但作品本身却表現得十分明白，主題靠筆墨是歪曲不了的，公道自在人心，事實最為雄辯，最後的判斷，我們讓賢明的觀眾來决定好了。</p>
<p>我們堅信「製作者知心朋友和觀眾打成一片，根據觀眾的需要，愼重造作」，才是中國電影的出路，而所謂「與觀眾打成一片」，並不是「媚悅少數落後的觀眾。覷着他們的弱點，以種種色情的，偵探的低級趣味來投其所好」，而是「一面充實內容，一面提高技術水準」，無論就文化立塲言，就商業立塲言，這都是顛撲不破的眞理，假如藝華公司認為這些意見都是「曲解歪纏」，自然無話可說：否則一切爭論便都是多餘的，若夫「便所風光，浴室裸影」，硬要和「民族文化」拉在一起，那末我們眞的祗好默然無言了。</p>
<p>總之，我們的忠吿，是祗為了中國電影文化事業的進步，我們嚴正地執行批評的工作，也不始自今日，我們知「忠言逆耳，良藥苦口」，但迫於正義，也就無從出賣良心，求悅於人。至於曲解事實，橫加輕薄，我們祗認為淺妄可笑，不願置辯。</p>
<p>最後我們仍然懇切希望藝華公司：今後最好是以不移的事實來答覆輿論的指摘，以獲得眞實的勝利。三十二人同啟（名略）</p>

<h3>Morale of Bandit-Puppet Troops Collapsing; Chaotic Situation in Shangdu; Our Northeast Hebei Garrison Troops Mobilized to Suppress; Majority of Puppet Troops Concentrating Toward Guyuan; Important Meeting Held Yesterday at Jiabusi</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram: Between Jining, Zhangbei, Tianchang, Kangbao, and Shangdu, the recapture of Da Miao by our forces has led to wavering military morale, and the city is in a state of chaos. It is widely rumored in Jiabusi that we will seize the opportunity to recover the six counties of Northern Chahar, causing immense panic among the Mongolian puppet forces. The puppet troops have heavily deployed sentries to prevent accidents. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram: A military conference was held in Jiabusi on the eleventh. Due to the recapture of Da Miao by our national army and the defection of Wang Ying's troops, a certain army headquarters from outside the pass dispatched a certain deputy chief of staff and a certain chief of the second section to fly to the area. They summoned De Wang, Li Shouxin, Wang Jingxiu, Zhuoshishai, and others for discussions. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram: A certain party is forcing De Wang into a desperate struggle, conscripting Mongolian security teams from the rear to join the front lines of Northeastern Hebei. Zhuoshishai and Bao Yueqing are both in Jiabusi deploying troops. However, after the loss of Da Miao, De Wang has lost his central influence, and the Mongolian people no longer heed his calls. Our Northeastern Hebei garrison troops have been gradually moving towards a certain area since the tenth, with fierce battles expected near Shangdu within a few days. The frontline soldiers are enthusiastically competing to be the first to depart, showing no signs of retreating despite the severe cold of minus thirty degrees, a rare sight in recent years. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Wang Ying is currently fleeing towards the Halabagay area in the grasslands north of Suiyuan. Sun Changsheng returned to a certain place on the eleventh to confer with Zeng Yanyi regarding the aftermath. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Party Increases Troops and Transports Weapons from Rehe</p>
<p>Zhangbei: Recent Situation of the Bandit-Puppets Bordering Suiyuan. (1) A certain party is increasing troops and transporting weapons from Rehe. Wang Jingxiu's troops are responsible for defense affairs in Duolun and the trenches south of Zhangbei, while Zhang Haipeng's troops are responsible for defense in Kangbao and Shangdu, advancing westward step by step. On the eleventh, an official from a certain special service agency in Jiabusi stated that they are determined not to retreat any further. The forward supply station will be set up in the temple and Zhangbei, with the main station in Duolun. (2) Most of the Rehe troops have concentrated in Guyuan and plan to dig trenches along the Great Wall. (3) Li Shouxin's troops are mostly stationed in Shangdu, with Li Shi traveling back and forth between the temple and Shangdu. (4) There are several hundred regular troops of a certain power in Qitai and Bataishan west of Shangdu, and more than five hundred in Pangjiang. (5) Zhang Haipeng's troops have concentrated three thousand west of Shangdu and Jiabusi, and two thousand in Pangjiang. A certain party's supervising team is currently stationed in Wulanhada and Shitai, west of Shangdu. (7) Three thousand Mongolian soldiers are stationed in Hatuoha, west of Shangdu. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Recapture of Da Miao: Political Success</p>
<p>(Guihua) According to military authorities of a certain army, the army's recapture of Da Miao is not merely a military victory, but indeed a political success. Ordinary military victories are mostly limited to the recapture of a single place, but cannot grasp the overall situation. Only political success can achieve a complete solution, creating a situation akin to pacifying the region with a simple proclamation. Therefore, the significance of recapturing Da Miao is not limited to the recapture of a single place. In fact, it has further led to the complete resolution of the situation in Northern Suiyuan, which is of utmost importance. (Eleventh Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gui-Sui Telegram: After the national army's recapture of Da Miao, the situation in Suiyuan is also becoming tense. The national army is actively carrying out plans to encircle a certain place. There are currently only Bao Yueqing's remnant troops and four to five thousand puppet soldiers in Shangdu. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) A certain party is furious after the national army's recapture of Da Miao. In addition to sending aircraft to bomb and drop bombs on national army units, they are still plotting to struggle and retaliate. The national army has increased its defenses. Da Miao is 160 li west of Bailingmiao, 60 li from Wulanhua, 150 li south of Wuchuan, and more than 400 li east of the bandits' old nest, Jiabusi. (Tenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Defecting Troops Arrive at Wulanhua</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission received a telegram from Director Yan on the eleventh, stating that according to a telegram from Chairman Fu on the eleventh, Jin Xianzhang, commander of the puppet Second Division, who had retreated and gathered at Da Miao and Hatong Temple, defected on the tenth with more than two thousand of his troops. Jin himself is expected to arrive in Wulanhua, and his troops will arrive near Wulanhua around noon on the eleventh. (Eleventh Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian received a telegram from Pacification Director Yan, stating that Jin Xianzhang, commander of the puppet Second Division, who had retreated and gathered at Da Miao and Hatong, defected on the tenth with more than two thousand of his troops. Jin himself and his troops have arrived in Wulanhua. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) On the tenth, after the national army recovered Da Miaozi, Pan Wang sent representatives to offer comfort. The defecting Jin Xianzhang and Shi Yushan are currently reorganizing their troops in Northern Suiyuan and are unable to come to Suiyuan for the time being. On the morning of the tenth, Ge Zihou, a regimental commander of Jin's troops, came to Suiyuan, visited Chuan Zhao for instructions, and returned to Wuchuan for defense at noon. De Wang's troops, the Mukedengbao Division, have been disarmed by Jin's troops. The Mongolian puppet troops, except for those who have defected, have largely disintegrated. With the recapture of Da Miao, the Suiyuan situation has temporarily come to an end. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jin Xianzhang and Others Send Out a Defection Circular Telegram</p>
<p>(Guihua) Jin Xianzhang and Shi Yushan, brigade commanders of Wang Ying's troops, led ten regiments in defection successively and issued the following circular telegram on the tenth. (Titles omitted) Xianzhang, Yushan, and others have experienced hardship since leaving the military, but our patriotic hearts have never lagged behind others. When Wang Ying went to Northern Chahar, we strongly advised him not to do things that would endanger the country and harm future generations. Limited by circumstances, we were unable to succeed. Upon reflection, since we could not stop him, it would be better to join in and defect at an opportune moment. Unexpectedly, since entering Northern Chahar, the mental anguish has been ten times what we imagined. People raise us and nurture us, only for temporary use. They treat us like slaves and look upon us as expendable. At the slightest setback, slaughter follows. All weapons for harming our fellow countrymen, such as poison gas, tanks, airplanes, and artillery, are replenished, fearing they are not complete enough. All schemes to provoke ethnic animosity, alienate national unity, and divide the country are planned, fearing they are not poisonous enough. When utilizing us, they tempt us with lavish money and benefits. When not utilizing us, they reward us with extremely cruel swords and axes. What is regrettable is that the people of Northern Chahar have suffered terribly, conscripting troops, gathering swords, raping, and looting. All of this, not only have Xianzhang and others witnessed and felt pain, gnashing our teeth in tears, but the people of Northern Chahar are also clenching their fists, suppressing tears, and vowing to return to our country. At that time, people from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Chahar all shared this sentiment, enduring pain and awaiting the opportunity to avenge our fellow countrymen, which has been long overdue. Just when we were forced to transfer to Northern Suiyuan, Xianzhang and Yushan, without prior agreement, led all ten regiments of Wang Ying's troops on the eighth and ninth, successively returning to our allegiance, realizing our original intentions. Considering that Xianzhang, Yushan, and others are fortunate to have extracted ourselves, there are still several points that we must report to society and friendly nations. (1) Friendly nations should have a new understanding and far-reaching expectations of our nation. Our nation has already embarked on the road to rejuvenation. The selfishness, pursuit of benefits and wealth, and adherence to personal sentiments of the past have all become the past. From now on, wise politicians of friendly nations should change their ravenous and cunning behavior to a psychology of peace and mutual respect. Then, the two great nations can join hands and help each other, sufficient to enhance the position of peace in East Asia. We, for the sake of our countrymen's survival, have decided not to be used by others to harm our own kind. This can be asserted. (2) The people of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Chahar, and other forced compatriots, have endured hardships for a long time and understand righteousness. It is only limited by circumstances that they dare not make piecemeal sacrifices. Now, with Jiang being open and just, leading the country to save the nation, the entire population is engaged in a desperate struggle for survival. For the sake of our comrades, if they can endure humiliation and wait for the time, they may as well delay their defection temporarily. If time is running out, they should return as soon as possible and share the great cause of saving the nation. Since Xianzhang has received undue favor, he hopes that his comrades will see the light of day as soon as possible. (3) Our Chinese nation, faced with severe national difficulties, must unite to save itself. Chinese people not fighting Chinese people is the unanimous psychology of the entire population. The recent war in Suiyuan can prove that our nation has thoroughly awakened and our country will surely be restored. Taking the battles of Bailingmiao in Northeastern Suiyuan as an example, the enemy, with several times the number of troops, supported by airplanes, poison gas, tanks, and other weapons, and under the supervision of machine guns by the instigators, our national army bravely resisted, willing to shed blood for the nation. Compared with the hesitant and demoralized attitude of those forced compatriots who were unwilling, unable, and unwilling to fight, this is like heaven and earth. At the same time, the local militias and Mongolian people secretly helped in the battle, and the elders of the whole country enthusiastically transported supplies, all of which are sufficient to prove the strong national consciousness of our nation. It can be inferred that those who were used in the past will continue to extract themselves. Even if there are one or two who have lost their minds, it will be difficult to prevent their subordinates from taking patriotic actions. The great cause of saving the country has already laid a good foundation. All our compatriots are willing to work hard. We specially express our humble sincerity and await your wise instructions. Jin Xianzhang, Shi Yushan, Cao Kai, Zhang Zijing, Wang Fengjun, Ge Zihou, Zhao Kuige, Wang Huimin, all kowtowing. (Eleventh Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Responsible Person Answers the Statement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Saying That If There Are Any Illegal Actions Within Our Territory, We Absolutely Will Not Allow Them and Will Surely Find Ways to Eliminate Them</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on December 10 in the name of its spokesperson regarding the current Sino-Japanese negotiations. A reporter visited the responsible person of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the eleventh, and the following is a record of the conversation. (Reporter asked) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the tenth regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations. I wonder how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs views this, and whether it is prepared to issue another statement. (Answered) The Ministry has already issued a statement on the seventh of this month regarding its attitude towards the Sino-Japanese negotiations, and has fully explained the sections that we should declare. There is no need to issue another statement, and it does not seem to have much meaning to repeatedly issue statements before the negotiations are concluded. (Reporter asked) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement mentioned that China and Japan are in complete agreement on three points: hiring Japanese advisors, cracking down on illegal Koreans, and reducing Chinese import taxes. What is the truth? (Answered) Our views on the above issues are still consistent with the news released by the Central News Agency on the seventh of this month. Please refer to that article to understand the truth. (Reporter asked) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement claimed that China has agreed to Japan to eradicate all anti-Japanese movements and revise anti-Japanese textbooks. What is the truth? (Answered) In past conversations, we have repeatedly stated frankly that our government has been doing its best to promote friendly relations and admonish the people. This has been our government's consistent policy. However, the emotions of the people arise naturally from the environment. The way to restore the people's feelings is to first eliminate the causes of animosity. Otherwise, even if the government strictly suppresses them, it may not achieve the results we desire. As for cracking down on anti-Japanese textbooks, we have pointed out that our country has no so-called anti-Japanese textbooks, and the Ministry of Education has a textbook review committee. Any textbook containing incorrect or insulting records, or comments that provoke international animosity, does not meet the set review standards. However, textbooks contain historical records, which are very legitimate and cannot be interfered with. (Reporter asked) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the memorandum left by Kawagoe records various issues that China has agreed to, and seems to be asking the Chinese government to implement them as soon as possible. What is our view? (Answered) Regarding the Kawagoe memorandum, the process has been recorded in various newspapers. The Japanese embassy calls this document a note verbale, which is a memorandum prepared unilaterally by the other party. We have formally declared to the Japanese side that this document cannot be used as a basis for reference, as many of the contents of the document do not match the previous negotiations. (Reporter asked) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that we have largely accepted the Japanese demands regarding the incidents that have occurred in various places. Is this true? (Answered) After the Chengdu incident occurred, the Ministry immediately advocated for a quick resolution in accordance with international conventions. Negotiations on a resolution are now beginning. (Reporter asked) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that after the Suiyuan issue occurred, we seemed to have an attitude of denying past conversations. Is this true? (Answered) We have not denied any of the sections discussed in the negotiations. However, while negotiations were underway, new situations that we were concerned about suddenly occurred, making it more difficult to conduct discussions. The issues discussed have not yet been concluded. (Reporter asked) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that if the lives and property of Japanese people in China are threatened, or if Japanese interests in China are infringed upon, the Japanese side will take necessary measures on the spot. What is our attitude towards this? (Answered) China has indeed not done anything to harm Japan's legitimate interests, and we should provide appropriate protection for the lives and property of Japanese people in accordance with international conventions. However, the Chinese government will not allow any foreign country to take any illegal actions within Chinese territory under any pretext, and will surely find ways to eliminate them. (Eleventh Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with foreign journalists today and denied the Allied News Agency's report that the Japanese government has abandoned hope of resolving the issue with China through diplomatic channels. He said that the Japanese government still hopes to resolve various issues with China through diplomatic channels, as evidenced by the fact that the Japanese government has not yet recalled Ambassador Kawagoe. When asked why the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement yesterday did not mention China's reservations on various issues, the spokesperson replied that the Japanese statement was intended to declare Japan's views on the various issues that had been negotiated. The Chinese declaration expressed the views of the Chinese government, so there was no need to mention China's intentions in yesterday's statement. The spokesperson today acknowledged for the first time that the Japanese government has considered China's reservations, but said that Japan will never accept them. (Eleventh Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Kawagoe went to Shanghai, Suma and Gao Zongwu are discussing Sino-Japanese negotiations, such as the Chengdu incident. The two sides did not continue negotiations on the eleventh. It is heard that the trend of negotiations on the Chengdu incident is that it will not be difficult to resolve if it is handled in accordance with international conventions. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Guangzhou "Nightlife" The Latest Situation: People Go to Bed Early and Get Up Early; Traffic Stops at Midnight</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Guangzhou's "nightlife" has always been very prosperous and has contributed to the city's prosperity, but it no longer exists. Since the authorities implemented the New Life Movement, all theaters, entertainment venues, restaurants, tea houses, shops, etc. in the city must be closed by midnight. Thus, Guangzhou's entire nightlife has come to an end. Furthermore, since the authorities banned playing mahjong, all the restaurants and hotels in the city have been unusually quiet, and their business has been greatly affected. Recently, the police station has also prohibited people from walking or riding in cars through the streets after midnight. The New Life Committee has also ordered people to go to bed early and get up early, and public buses and other vehicles have also complied with the order to stop running after midnight.

<h3>Remarks by Japanese Foreign Ministry Authorities: The Intention Lies in Addressing Domestic Concerns, There is No Immediate Tendency for Sino-Japanese Relations to Worsen, Awaiting China's Attitude Before Deciding on Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a "Statement by Authorities" on the 10th, outlining the Japanese government's policy plan and opinions regarding Sino-Japanese negotiations. Although the meaning of the document seems important, the wording is quite cautious, and its purpose is to influence domestic opinion rather than to demonstrate power to China. No mention is made of the situation in China; only the points that both sides have supposedly already agreed upon are listed. The conclusion includes a phrase: "Japan will pay close attention to how China will crack down on anti-Japanese sentiment." The focus of the entire text can be seen in this sentence. The Allied Press published a table on the 10th showing the number of Japanese residents under the jurisdiction of Japanese consulates in China, which was published at the same time as the above document, which is obviously not without reason. According to general observations here, after the Chengdu, Beihai, and other incidents are resolved, the Japanese government seems to be waiting quietly for China's attitude before deciding on future policies. Therefore, the future of Sino-Japanese relations does not have an immediate tendency to worsen. Recently, there has been a growing sense among Japanese intellectuals that alleviating the rift between the peoples of China and Japan and enhancing goodwill is the most urgent task. Currently, many are seriously concerned about the signing of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement. If the Soviet Union continues to delay the signing of the agreement, Japan may take free action. The fishing season is approaching, starting in May next year. Under such circumstances, it is possible that Japan-Soviet relations will worsen. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>Pingjin Paper Shortage</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) It is now known that the fundraising methods for the Jing-Gan Railway and the two public bonds of Jin Province have been successfully discussed with the banking sector. Of the 14 million yuan of construction public bonds for the Jing-Gan Railway, the Bank of Communications will underwrite 4 million yuan, the China Farmers Bank 3 million yuan, the Four Banks Savings Society 2.5 million yuan, and the China South Salt Industry, Jincheng, and Dalu Banks 1 million yuan each, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank 500,000 yuan. The 10 million yuan of public bonds in Jin Province, because they are for repaying advances from the Jin Province Bank, will still be underwritten by the bank. Furthermore, the annual revenue from land taxes and provincial surcharges in Jin Province is more than 1.43 million yuan, which will definitely be sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the public bonds of Jin Province in the future.

<h3>The Importance of Recapturing Damiaozi</h3>
<p>— Beginning</p>
<p>Since the overcoming of Bailingmiao, our army has played the second miracle in Suiyuan. The news of the capture of Damiaozi made the people feel a great revival again.</p>
<p>In terms of the military situation, the position of Damiaozi is very important. After losing Bailingmiao, Damiaozi became the most important military base for bandits and puppets. In this base, the remnants were reorganized and the strength was replenished. The bandits and puppets could attack Bailingmiao at any time. If Bailingmiao was shaken, it could further threaten Baotou, Guihua, and affect the overall situation in Suiyuan. Furthermore, if our army intends to make progress in eastern Suiyuan, it is essential to eliminate this hidden danger in northern Suiyuan. Without any worries in northern Suiyuan, our army can concentrate its forces and expand from eastern Suiyuan, realizing the plan to recover lost territory. In short, the recapture of Bailingmiao and Damiaozi showed special importance under the above circumstances, which completely eliminated the possibility of harassment in northern Suiyuan in a passive aspect, and opened up a new situation for promoting to eastern Suiyuan in a positive aspect.</p>
<p>In the recent victorious battle records of our army, we can get the following three revelations.</p>
<p>First, the recent victory has powerfully proved the mistake of "defeatism". Until recently, many people still doubted the strength of our army's resistance. This group of people believed that our army, whether in weapons or other equipment, was not enough to compare with the enemy, so it was difficult to win. However, the bandits and puppet troops who attacked me were supplied with military equipment and clothing by a certain party that instigated them, and there were also officers from a certain party directing the battle. As a result, our army actually won repeatedly and recovered important towns such as Bailingmiao and Damiaozi. The iron-like facts told us that our army has a very strong fighting force.</p>
<p>Second, from these two victories, we can see that our military should turn to a favorable trend—from passively resisting to actively recovering lost territory. Whether from a military technical point of view or other aspects, we can only gain victory by creating a factual advantage. Suppose that our army only guarded itself carefully against the enemy's attacks and did not actively capture important military bases such as Bailingmiao, perhaps northern and eastern Suiyuan would have been threatened many times more severely than they are now. Some people do not advocate any proactive military action, reasoning that it avoids the enemy's expanded entanglement. Little do they know that such a passive proposition, if applied, is precisely the root of the enemy's expanded entanglement. Only by initiating proactive actions can we cut off our current entanglements.</p>
<p>Third, from the fact that pseudo-bandits have defected one after another, we have gained a confirmation that is beneficial to our situation. People who observe the Suiyuan war with a pessimistic mindset often have a mistaken observation, thinking that pseudo-bandits and even the instigators behind them are a single harmonious entity. Taking the entire strength of their single entity to resist our partial resistance, naturally, there is only an ending of our defeat and their victory. They do not understand that pseudo-bandits and even the instigators behind them themselves have many contradictions and gaps. We must take advantage of such contradictions as much as possible to create our great advantage. The recapture of Damiao this time was, with the defection of Wang Ying's troops, Shi Yushan and others, as its prelude, which is a clear proof.</p>

<h3>British Parliament Passes Third Reading: Abdication Bill Becomes Law; Independent Labor Party's Amendment Rejected; New Monarch Set to Ascend the Throne Today, Named "George VI" Instead of "Albert I"</h3>
<p>(London) At 1:52 PM today, Parliament announced the King's approval of the Abdication Bill. Edward VIII, who inherited the throne upon the death of George V five minutes before midnight on January 20, 1936, ceased to be the King of England and Emperor of India.</p>
<p>The new British monarch will be Prince Albert, Duke of York, and the Duchess of York will become Queen. Their nine-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, will be the heir apparent.</p>
<p>Both Houses of Parliament passed the Abdication Bill at the third reading within two hours and thirty minutes today, with the solemn rituals of ancient times. Within fifteen minutes, the bill, after receiving royal assent, was announced by the Clerk of Parliament, thus becoming law. Edward VIII has now retired as a commoner and is free to marry his beloved Mrs. Simpson.</p>
<p>This morning, the Prime Minister briefly moved in the Lower House to have the bill read for the second time, reiterating the need to swiftly restore national normalcy and maintain peace. Subsequent speakers echoed this sentiment. Opposition leader Attlee rose to support the bill, stating that the throne was now endangered by vulgar flattery and should be made more ordinary. Liberal Party leader Sinclair also supported the bill. Independent Labor Party member Maxton introduced an amendment to reject the bill and advocate for the abolition of the hereditary throne. Home Secretary Simon followed, stating that recent events have demonstrated how deeply ingrained the concept of constitutional monarchy is in the hearts of the British people. The Lower House then rejected Maxton's amendment by a vote of 403 to 5 and passed the second reading of the bill.</p>
<p>The bill is brief, beginning with a preamble followed by three clauses. The abdication decree is also included in the bill. The first clause is historical and without precedent, stipulating that upon royal assent, the abdication decree shall immediately take effect. Edward VIII will no longer be the monarch, and the crown shall be passed down, therefore to be accepted by whoever in the royal family resolves to inherit the abdication. The second clause stipulates that Edward VIII, his children, and their descendants shall have no rights to the succession to the throne after the abdication. The third clause stipulates that the Royal Marriages Act, which requires royal approval for marriages within the royal family, shall not apply to Edward VIII, his children, and their descendants after the abdication.</p>
<p>During the passage of the bill, Lord Chancellor Somervell responded to questions, stating that the title of Edward VIII should be determined by the new monarch at the appropriate time. The Lord Chancellor also responded to a question from Labor MP Thorne, stating that the claim that Edward VIII would be forced to leave the country was inaccurate. The Lower House then passed the third reading of the bill and sent it to the Upper House, which passed all three readings within fifteen minutes of receiving it from the Lower House. During the passage of the bill in the Lower House, the Lord Chancellor also declared that the revenues enjoyed by the King from England and the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster would henceforth belong to the new monarch. What action the Lower House will take in the future is not within the scope of today's discussion.

<p>(London) The new monarch, who ascended the throne this afternoon, will be formally proclaimed at St. James's Palace tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM.

<p>(London) Monday is the 41st birthday of the new monarch Albert. Various departments of the Empire are preparing to announce the new monarch's accession and celebrate his birthday on that day. The Governor-General of Northern Ireland, the Duke of Abercorn, is convening the Northern Ireland Parliament to meet next week or on Wednesday, at which time the new monarch's succession will be announced. The new monarch's proclamation will then be publicly read in Belfast, Londonderry, and other key areas. Meanwhile, the Australian Federal Parliament has unanimously passed a resolution recognizing the Duke of York's succession to the throne. The governments of Victoria and South Australia have also announced a holiday on Monday, the new monarch's birthday. The New South Wales government has also declared a holiday on Monday and will announce the new monarch's accession on that day. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Straightforward Advice: Baldwin Did Not Fail as Prime Minister; The Royal Family is the Golden Chain of the British Empire; If Respect for the Monarchy Disappears, Harm Will Follow; Parliament Praises the Abdicating King's Decisiveness</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons met yesterday afternoon, first with the Speaker reading the Abdication Instrument, followed by Prime Minister Baldwin moving that the Instrument be submitted for discussion. He stated, "The Instrument received by Parliament has never been so serious in nature as this time, and the Prime Minister's responsibilities have never been so difficult as this time." The Prime Minister then recounted the events, saying that he had been friends with Edward VIII before he ascended the throne, and their personal friendship had deepened in recent days of discussion. "In October of this year, various American newspapers had already published various rumors about Mrs. Simpson. People across the Empire were extremely uneasy and sent letters to me inquiring about the truth. Therefore, I thought it was imperative that someone advise the King that allowing such slander to grow would inevitably lead to a serious situation." "However, because it concerned the King himself, only the Prime Minister was responsible for advising him. Therefore, I did not seek the opinions of the cabinet but instead sought the King's approval to meet with him face-to-face without attendants at Fort Belvedere on Tuesday, October 20th, to offer straightforward advice. The King was magnanimous and did not consider it disrespectful. I told the King that although our monarchy has lost some privileges for a long time, its position is far more noble than in the past (applause from the members). Our monarchical system must be kept intact. This is not only the final link connecting the various territories of the British Empire, but also a barrier to prevent the disasters that have occurred in other countries from happening in our country. Furthermore, the people's respect for the royal family has increased over three reigns. If public opinion is allowed to run rampant without restraint, respect for the monarchy will quickly disappear, and it will be very difficult to restore it. For these reasons, I advised the King that it would be very worrying if Mrs. Simpson's divorce proceedings were to continue, and if Mrs. Simpson were to marry the King, she would inevitably be crowned Queen, which the country would never agree to. However, the King told me, 'I am determined to marry Mrs. Simpson and am prepared to abdicate.' Since then, the King consulted with Queen Mary and his brothers, and on November 25th, he summoned me to discuss the plan for a morganatic marriage (referring to marrying Mrs. Simpson without making her Queen). I stated that Parliament would likely not approve of this plan. Subsequently, after I sought the opinions of the cabinet ministers and the prime ministers of the various dominions, they were also unable to agree. I then met with the King again on the 2nd of this month to tell him that this matter was difficult to carry out. ... The King, with a magnanimous spirit, immediately expressed that only by abdicating could he reduce the disputes among the cabinet and the people. If his brother could inherit the throne without difficulty after his abdication, he would be deeply gratified. For this reason, I dare say that anyone who organizes a so-called 'King's Party' in the name of supporting the King is detested by the King (applause from the members). To avoid various demonstrations, the King decided to reside at Fort Belvedere and not leave. He is very close to his brother, the Duke of York, and believes that the subjects of the Empire will unanimously support the Duke after he ascends the throne (applause from the members). ... The King also told me that he could not bear the burden of handling all affairs without a woman's help. However, until the last few days, I was still helping the King find a solution, but to no avail. The King then made his final decision. The government only received the King's reply when it held a cabinet meeting yesterday morning. The cabinet immediately drafted a memorial requesting the King to change his mind, but the King replied that he still believed he could not comply. Although we deeply regret this, we have no other choice but to quickly comply with the King's wishes. Now we must unite and follow the new King to assist him so that the suffering caused by this incident can be quickly healed. We have a heavy responsibility, and we must be loyal from now on so that the country's fortunes will become more prosperous and the people will be blessed." After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the majority of the members of the Lower House applauded and cheered, expressing their approval. Opposition Labor Party leader Attlee suggested adjourning the meeting until 6:00 PM in the afternoon, which was accepted by the Speaker. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>The Lower House continued its meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Members of all parties expressed warm praise for the King. Speakers included Labor Opposition Leader Attlee, Liberal Party Leader Sinclair, Conservative Churchill, Independent Labor Party Maxton, and Labor Wedgwood, among others. The Prime Minister then introduced a motion to give effect to the King's abdication declaration. The motion is scheduled to be read for the second time this morning and passed into law before the adjournment of both Houses today. The King's final action was to approve the motion, which meant that the King and his descendants could no longer inherit the throne.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Attlee immediately rose amid cheers, saying that after reading the lengthy abdication declaration, he could not help but feel sorrow. The whole country will also be deeply saddened by this news. The King's subjects feel that this is their own loss. No one knows the British monarch more deeply than Edward, the King of England, and all subjects of the Empire. We know that the King's heart must be filled with sorrow (cheers from the crowd). The people wanted to find a way to resolve this issue, but all methods were difficult to implement, and they still hoped that it would not lead to abdication. But the King decisively decided to abdicate, and we have no choice but to accept it. Now all the people wish the King a long and happy life in the future. The country has suffered a major shock, and it will take time to recover. It is difficult for anyone to inherit the throne today. We must do our best to lighten his burden. Attlee then offered comfort to Prime Minister Baldwin and, on behalf of the Labor Party, expressed his deepest condolences to the Queen Mother.</p>
<p>Sir Sinclair rose to speak, saying that Edward had faithfully served the country for nearly 25 years, forging a close link between the King and all classes, religions, and races of the Empire. Now that this link has been broken, we feel deeply saddened, especially the King's cabinet members and advisors, most of all the Prime Minister. The Liberal Party congratulates the government on its wisdom in not attempting to divide the country over this issue. The fact that the crown has not fallen into our political debate is due to the King's wisdom. Sinclair also expressed his support for the government's rejection of the morganatic marriage proposal. Sinclair concluded that the one who deserves the greatest sympathy today is the King's beloved brother, the new King, the Duke of York, who has a distinguished record over the years (cheers from the crowd) and a natural inclination towards democracy.</p>
<p>Churchill said, "Mutual recriminations are over and done with. What has not been done should be left to history. I will listen and not ask." No one has ever been able to abide by the letter and spirit of the constitution as well as the current King, because the King has resolutely sacrificed his position for the sake of the country's peace and strength. Churchill continued, "During the turmoil, I advocated for a calm discussion, because if there was any hope that time could bring a solution, we should endure the pain." As far as the government is concerned, the King's decision was not made hastily. Churchill continued, "I accept the Prime Minister's declaration and believe that Edward's final decision was completely voluntary and was not subject to any pressure from others." Churchill also praised Edward's various noble qualities and said that although the country's hope that the King would not abdicate has disappeared, the King's noble character will be immortal, and the poor people of the country will never forget the King. We must now seek to consolidate the throne and give the new King who is succeeding the strength that comes from loving the unity of the Empire. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Finally, Independent Labor Party member Maxton, Opposition Labor Party member Wedgwood, Communist Party member Gallacher, and Independent Labor Party member Buchanan spoke in succession. Their remarks were radical and unexpected, causing an uproar in the audience. Maxton said, "Past events have proven that the monarchical system is no longer suitable for the times, and the United Kingdom should be changed to a republic." Wedgwood criticized the government, saying that it should not have forced the King to abdicate, because the King was surrounded by villains who used the King's emotions to oppose the cabinet and the constitution. It was impossible for the King to be comfortable in his position. The Labor Party's attitude can be said to have fallen into the government's trap. The labor movement should now express itself in order to extricate itself. Buchanan said, "Those who praise the King are all hypocrites, and their motives are beyond questioning." Finally, Conservative Party member Flannery expressed the veterans' farewell to His Majesty Edward VIII. The Speaker then announced that the first reading of the Abdication Bill was completed and adjourned the meeting until tomorrow. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Lower House of British Parliament to Swear Allegiance to New Monarch Today</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin announced in the Lower House today that he could bring the new monarch's decree to the House and officially read it at 6:00 PM next Monday and will move to make a reply speech. Members of the Lower House will meet tomorrow to officially swear allegiance to the new monarch. This ceremony will continue next Monday. Parliament has scheduled to begin the Christmas holiday on the 18th of this month. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Edward Demoted to Commoner, Possesses Little Property</h3>
<p>(London) On the day of the death of the late King George V, he gave four million pounds in cash to various grandchildren. The abdicated King Edward VIII was not eligible to share in this inheritance. Therefore, the property owned by the abdicated King is only Fort Belvedere and the savings he had during his time as Duke of Cornwall. Now that he has been demoted to a commoner and calls himself Mr. Windsor, he has no other property to inherit. Therefore, it is generally believed that after the new monarch ascends the throne, he will grant him the title of Duke and the attached property. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Edward Announces Abdication, Dominions Unanimously Regret, Consider it a Tragic Scene in British History, Will Vow Eternal Loyalty to Motherland, South Ireland Prepares to Abolish Governor-General System</h3>
<p>(London) Throughout the British Empire, deep sorrow and sympathy are being expressed for the news of King Edward VIII's abdication. In South Africa, extreme sorrow is felt for Edward's abdication, but a warm welcome is also being expressed for the new monarch. Canadians believe that Edward's decision is a tragic scene. Australian Prime Minister Lyons said when announcing the abdication, "We really didn't want the King to do this. Now we can only bid farewell to the old monarch with a sorrowful heart and turn our thoughts to the new monarch, who is also well known and loved by us." New Zealand Prime Minister Savage also expressed the same sentiment after receiving the abdication telegram, saying, "This is one of the most tragic days in British people's history. New Zealand's loyalty to the motherland will never be forgotten." Irish Free State Executive Chairman de Valera said, "Regarding the Irish Free State, Edward's abdication must take effect after the necessary laws are passed by Parliament." Irish Parliament Speaker Fahan issued a notice convening all members to meet at 3:00 PM today to discuss constitutional and other legal amendments due to Edward's abdication. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>Crowds Gather in Front of New Monarch's Residence, Enthusiastic Cheers Shake the Sky</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the sunshine shines through the fog over the whole city, enough to symbolize the relaxation of the national tension. Yesterday afternoon and evening, there were crowds in front of the Houses of Parliament near Downing Street and the residences of the London royal family, but the numbers were not large. The largest number was in front of the new monarch's residence in Piccadilly. The crowds waited for him to return from Windsor Palace. When the new monarch arrived by car, everyone gave him enthusiastic cheers. But the people still gathered and did not disperse. Before long, the new monarch left the residence again by car to visit the Queen Mother at Marlborough House. The crowd saw him again. The new monarch stayed at that building until 1:25 AM this morning. By that time, more and more people had gathered outside the residence. When the new monarch returned to the residence, the crowd cheered him again and shouted "God Save the King." Edward's abdication is completely understood not only in the United Kingdom, but also in Europe and other foreign countries in terms of its difficult circumstances. Foreign newspapers commented by expressing sympathy for Prime Minister Baldwin's painstaking efforts in this matter and the British people's sorrow and admiration in dealing with the situation by all the main people involved without losing their identity. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Blackshirts Demonstrate in Downing Street, Shouting Down With Baldwin</h3>
<p>(London) Today, 2,000 rioting people, mostly "Blackshirts," led by 150 people, rushed to 10 Downing Street, shouting slogans such as "Down with Baldwin" and "Support the People's King." There were also people in front of the Prime Minister's private residence demanding a decision by a national plebiscite. Although the police dispersed them, they continued to gather elsewhere, and the number of people increased. Sir Mosley's Blackshirts have always supported the King in this constitutional dispute, but most of the people currently tend towards the government, so there should not be any serious disturbances.

<h3>Please Listen to the Broadcast Address of the Abdicated King of England, Shanghai Time 6:00 AM Today</h3>
<p>(London) According to an official announcement by the British Broadcasting Corporation, King Edward will broadcast a declaration as soon as the abdication law is passed. The broadcaste of this program will be held at 10:00 PM tonight (Shanghai time is 6:00 AM on Saturday). The wavelengths are GSD, GSC, and GSB. The recording of this declaration will be broadcast to the Americas twice, one hour later and at 2:00 AM on Saturday. At 8:00 AM on Saturday (4:00 PM Shanghai time), it will be broadcast to Australia, the Pacific, and the Far East. At 11:00 AM on the same morning, it will be broadcast to Malaya and the Far East, at 2:00 PM to India and Ceylon, and at 5:15 PM to Africa and the Near East. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Preparations for Abdicated King's Departure, Destination Remains Top Secret, Bids Farewell to Friends and Family, Appears Sad and Dejected</h3>
<p>(London) Abdicated King Edward will depart the country tonight or tomorrow, but the destination remains top secret. Switzerland, Denmark, and Argentina have all been rumored as the King's destination. When Edward broadcasts a speech as a commoner on the radio tonight, it is heard that he will express loyalty to the new monarch. Efforts are being made to broadcast his speech throughout the world. Edward and his younger brother, the Duke of Kent, are quietly residing at Fort Belvedere, spending their last day as King. The King took this opportunity to bid farewell to his loyal confidants with whom he had spent many years, and walked around the entire building for a final inspection. Mr. Churchill arrived at Fort Belvedere at 1:00 PM this afternoon to have lunch with the King and the Duke of Kent. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Abdicated King Edward VIII flew out of Hendon Airfield in the suburbs in his own plane, destination unknown. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) When Parliament read Edward VIII's abdication instrument today, the King sat alone at Fort Belvedere, stroking his moustache and lost in thought. In the afternoon, the Dukes of York and Gloucester came to visit, and left soon after. Half an hour later, Prime Minister Baldwin presented the abdication instrument in the Lower House. All three of the King's brothers were present when the King signed the instrument. After the abdication, if Parliament allows him to retain the title of Duke of Cornwall, he will still have an annual income of £100,000. The King will probably never set foot on the country again after leaving England, and will never see Queen Mary again. However, the Duke of Kent may meet with him from time to time to maintain family relations. As for where Edward will go first, it is still unknown today. It is probably the European continent, but not necessarily the French Riviera to avoid interfering with Mrs. Simpson's divorce proceedings. If the final decree of Mrs. Simpson's divorce can take effect earlier, then it may not be necessary to wait until after April 27 next year to get married. The residence after the marriage is currently still a problem. One said that it would be the French Riviera, but it is also possible that he intends to move to Argentina in South America. Regarding the title after that, it has not been decided today. Court officials said that Edward may give up all his current titles and receive another dukedom. In any case, the government has already prepared for his financial problems. Some observers believe that the King will leave the country as soon as Parliament passes the abdication law and he signs it himself. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Lovers Lead to Honor, Mrs. Simpson is Deeply Moved, Encouraged Via Wireless Telephone</h3>
<p>Cannes, France Mrs. Simpson comforted King Edward of England on the wireless telephone today, using rather intimate terms. Mrs. Simpson was greatly impressed that Edward had given up his throne and honor for her. As for Edward's movements, telegrams are sent from time to time to the villa of the American friends Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, where Mrs. Simpson is staying. An Associated Press reporter asked Mr. Rogers if Mrs. Simpson would marry the King. Mr. Rogers replied, "I cannot answer or express an opinion, but judging from the general situation, it seems not far off." Currently, the King and Mrs. Simpson will meet in any day now to avoid legal difficulties that could invalidate the divorce decree due to the meeting. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Cannes, France The guards at the Rogers villa here suddenly withdrew today, and people suspect that Mrs. Simpson has secretly gone elsewhere. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>A Short History of the New Emperor</h3>
<p>The new Emperor George VI (Albert Frederick Arthur George) is the Duke of York, the second son of the late Emperor George V. Named Albert, he was born on December 14, 1895, just one and a half years younger than his elder brother, Edward. In their youth, he and his brother studied with the same tutors and played together until his brother entered the Worthy Marine Training School. In 1909, he also went to Worthpoint, attending the same school as his brother, at the age of fourteen. After two years, he transferred to Dartmouth to continue his studies. He then boarded an officer training ship to experience the ocean winds and waves. The Emperor loved mechanics and was very skilled in sailing. In his mind, the navy was his future. The Emperor operated on the ship with the other officer cadets, without receiving special treatment as a royal. One day, the late Emperor boarded the ship for inspection. The Emperor took his place in the line as usual. Although father and son had been apart for several months, the Emperor passed before his father without hesitation. On May 31, 1916, in the great Battle of Jutland, the Emperor, as a naval lieutenant, served in the forward turret of the cruiser "Columbus," commanding the twelve-inch caliber guns. He remained calm under intense fire. His courage was admired by all the officers and men on the ship. As a royal son, participating in naval warfare had not happened since another Duke of York fought the Dutch army off the coast of Lowestoft 250 years ago. Later, the ship presented the Emperor with the flag it had flown during the great battle as a souvenir. After the Battle of Jutland, the Emperor suffered from a severe stomach ailment, seemingly ending his beloved naval career. However, he continued to serve on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Portsmouth Naval Base. In July 1919, he obtained a pilot's license, allowing him to serve in the Air Ministry.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, many young men in the country lost their education due to joining the army. The Emperor was one of them. In the year of the war's end, the Emperor entered Cambridge University to further his studies, focusing on history, economics, and civics. Although the Emperor did not attend every lecture, his exceptional talent allowed him to gain considerable knowledge. The small pieces of paper signed "Prince A" by the Emperor during lectures were often taken from the storage box by souvenir collectors after the lectures, who treasured them as precious objects.</p>
<p>In June 1920, on the late Emperor's birthday, honors were bestowed upon the Emperor, making him the Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killarney. Three years later, in April 1923, he married Miss Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon at Westminster Abbey. At that time, the people rejoiced and contributed £2,500 for a wedding gift, which the Emperor donated to poor children. In the following years, the couple hunted in East Africa, capturing animals such as lions, elephants, and leopards. They also officially toured Australia and various dominions in the Southern Hemisphere. During his visit to Canberra, Australia, he presided over the opening ceremony of the new Parliament House. Everyone who came into contact with the Emperor admired his sincerity and kindness, which greatly increased the people's respect and love for the royal family. In 1928, the late Emperor's health deteriorated, and the Emperor was appointed as one of the six regents. The following year, the two major denominations of Scotland, which had been divided for many years, reunited. The Emperor represented his father at the ceremony in Edinburgh, with the Duchess accompanying him. Witnessing the grand ceremony, the couple said with emotion, "Our children should be brought into society early to broaden their horizons." At that time, the couple often brought their three-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. The following August, another daughter, named Rose, was born. The new Emperor is tall and handsome, with a gentle and solemn appearance, resembling his father more than his brothers. The Emperor is exceptionally kind and loves children. He often plays with his two daughters, tirelessly enjoying himself. At night, unless detained by business, he always goes to his daughters' rooms to say "goodnight." The Emperor is not only a loving father but also a faithful husband, so the couple is very affectionate. Wherever he goes, the Duchess always accompanies him. The new Emperor is very enthusiastic about social affairs. During his tours of various industrial towns, he visited even the poorest neighborhoods, leaving his footprints everywhere, hoping to broaden his knowledge and understand the hardships of the people. He cares about the people's suffering in this way. Once, during an inspection of a rubber factory, his followers told him that one area had a foul odor and he did not need to go there. The Emperor became angry and said, "How can that be? If the people can work there, why can't I go?" The Emperor often said that the two main characteristics of a leader should be idealism and compassion. The Emperor has a deep understanding of these two characteristics. One day, a child in a camp called the Emperor "a human being." The Emperor considered this the highest honor he had ever received.</p>
<p>Because the Emperor loves children and deeply believes that the future of the country depends on the goodwill and cooperation of all sectors of society, he annually gathers four hundred boys aged seventeen to nineteen for camping and recreation. Half of them are selected from public schools such as Eton, and the rest are selected from working children in various industrial centers. The purpose of this is to break down class barriers. Every summer, the boys live together in a camp for two weeks. Their work, sports, and swimming are all equal, and there is no class distinction. All the boys must wear loose shirts and shorts according to the rules. The Emperor also wears this attire and often spends one or two days with them. When he arrives at the camp, the boys cheer, because the Emperor always works with the boys, sometimes swimming. When tired of resting on the beach, he hands out snacks to the children, and they all chew together happily. The Emperor likes playing ball and fishing, and he is skilled in riding and shooting. In his youth, he studied radio diligently. The two radio stations in Buckingham Palace are all supervised and operated by the Emperor. After the birth of his daughters, he personally wired the nursery. The Emperor is good at driving cars. Whenever he goes out, although there is a driver, he likes to drive long distances himself. The Emperor loves hunting very much, but in 1931, due to the country's financial difficulties, the royal family reduced expenses and sold all his hunting dogs. (Reuters, November 11)</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Coronation Ceremony: Huge Losses for Merchants, Souvenirs Unable to Be Sold</h3>
<p>(London) Merchants who manufacture coronation ceremony souvenirs will suffer significant losses due to Emperor Edward's abdication. It is estimated that there are over eight million pieces of pottery manufactured for the coronation ceremony that are now unable to be sold. Large quantities of cotton and rayon goods bearing portraits of Emperor Edward have been completely discarded. Fortunately, some items only feature national flags and royal crown designs, which can be modified and sold during the new Emperor's coronation. Manufacturers of cheap souvenirs have suffered greatly this time. Tens of thousands of newly printed prayer books are now obsolete. Newly printed stamps by the post office will also be canceled entirely. It is reported that the mint had prepared to issue new coins in the New Year, but the currency of Edward VIII will no longer circulate in the world. (Reuters, November 11)</p>
<h3>British Press Commentary</h3>
<p>(London) Today, British newspapers unanimously expressed regret over Emperor Edward's abdication. While The Times also expressed this sentiment, its editorial offered rather blunt discussions of Emperor Edward's "stubbornness" and "habit of imprudence in foreign society." The newspaper stated that the throne and the empire had been greatly shaken, but would soon return to normal. "We now have to say that Emperor Edward had too many male and female friends, and most of them grew up in wealthy families. They rarely approached the people, so all their actions only considered their own entertainment and neglected the Emperor's happiness. The real conflict this time lies in the habit of imprudence in foreign society and the unwavering traditional thinking and behavior of Britain. We can see the Emperor's stubbornness in his irrevocable decision this time," it said. The Daily Mail reported that the pain in Emperor Edward's heart when he made the decision to abdicate was not difficult to imagine, but it could be asserted that the people would therefore increase their respect and sympathy for the Emperor. The Daily Telegraph said that the publication of Emperor Edward's abdication decree shocked the world. Because the Emperor usually won the hearts of the people so deeply, the public would not refuse any request he made. However, they were also driven by their duties. For example, the Emperor's request this time was for his beloved marriage for happiness, but in the eyes of the nation, they all believed that it would damage the dignity of the throne and the prestige of the country and had to be rejected. The Morning Post, in addition to expressing regret over Emperor Edward's abdication, also extended unlimited hope to the new monarch. The Glasgow Herald praised Emperor Edward's proper attitude and Prime Minister Baldwin's great statesmanlike demeanor, saying that the result of this issue today was due to the strength of the two men. The Scotsman's opinion was that the announcement of the abdication decree may not be the end of this incident. It must be known that Emperor Edward's future is full of thorns, and he should not be stubborn in his private opinions and disregard the hopes of the whole country. (Reuters, November 11)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council Meeting: Spanish Foreign Minister Cries Out Loudly, Accuses Italy and Germany of Interfering in Spanish Civil War, Hopes League of Nations Will Take Effective Measures to Stop It</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The temporary meeting of the League of Nations Council, which opened yesterday, held an open meeting at 11:30 this morning. The Spanish Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo delivered a long speech, stating that the Spanish government's appeal to the League of Nations was to prevent the domestic civil war from causing serious international repercussions. The fact that the British and French governments had proposed to Italy, Germany, Portugal, and Russia to stop interfering showed that the Spanish government's actions were fully justified. As for the war in Spain, although various countries had established a non-intervention agreement, hundreds of thousands of lives had died in the trenches, still victims of fascist air forces and foreign military supplies. At this point, Álvarez del Vayo cried out loudly, "A cruel war is underway, and this war is an international war within Spain!" He then said that after the Spanish rebel army suffered losses in Morocco, "foreign soldiers" (referring to volunteers from Italy and Germany) went to help them. The rebel army did not hesitate to use poison gas to kill government troops. If the rebel army were to win in the future, Italy and Germany might try to take possession of the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean, or even other naval bases. People often have a concept of peace, thinking that as long as peace can be maintained on the surface, it is okay to compromise. However, while this compromise is taking place, cities are being razed to ruins, and countless thousands are dying. This concept of peace is not to be followed. Álvarez del Vayo then listed the reasons for the Spanish government's appeal, saying that Italy and Germany recognized the Spanish rebel government as the legitimate government. The ports belonging to the government forces on the Spanish coast were in danger of being blockaded. "The power of the League of Nations has failed to prevent acts of aggression. Now, the disaster of a prairie fire is approaching. It is hoped that the League of Nations can at least prevent the spread of the war." Some say that convening a temporary meeting of the Council will lead to the expansion of the war. This statement is not accurate. It is hoped that the Council meeting will achieve concrete results on the Spanish civil war and not just be a preliminary and passive indication. Although Spain still supports the basic principles of the non-intervention agreement signed by various countries, given the different circumstances, it believes that this agreement has failed to take effect, which is already obvious. The urgent task is to remedy the defects of the non-intervention policy and strictly implement monitoring measures. However, the so-called monitoring measures must genuinely be effective, which is what Spain most desires. After Álvarez del Vayo finished his speech, the Council extended the meeting until 5:30 PM.

<h3>British Army and Navy Chiefs Announce Wartime Industrial Mobilization Plan: Control of Exports of Major Items</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of War Woodring and Secretary of the Navy Swanson separately announced today the outline of the U.S. industrial mobilization plan. Its contents stipulate that once a war occurs, the government will implement control policies for major items such as sugar, coffee, rubber, ordnance, military supplies, and transportation, as well as foreign and territorial trade. Once this mobilization bill is passed by Congress, President Roosevelt will have the power to declare when ordnance, military supplies, and other special goods (67 kinds) can be exported, as well as the quantity of exports. The bill also stipulates the organization of a Wartime Trade Management Committee to promote cooperation among government agencies, specializing in handling passport regulations and setting prices, in order to implement the control of import and export trade and exert economic pressure on enemy countries.

<h3>A Certain Party's Strategy of Aggression Changes Frequently, Failed to Counterattack Bailingmiao, Is Now Turning to Eastern Sui and Xinghe, Actively Increasing Troops and Transporting Weapons on the Southern Trench Front, A Certain Person Left Doron for Kangbao and Baochang</h3>
<p>Zhangbei Communication: The war situation in the Taolin and Xinghe areas of eastern Sui and central Sui has been quite silent recently. The bandits and puppets who counterattacked Bailingmiao have repeatedly failed. Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, and others are at their wits' end. There are even reports that Wang and Li have engaged in infighting, further revealing their state of elimination. The "certain party" behind the scenes, also seeing that our army's defensive lines are tightly guarded and that the bandit and puppet troops have repeatedly collapsed, has lost their sense of underestimating the enemy. The northward and eastward advances have been blocked everywhere. Therefore, their strategies have also changed frequently, sometimes trying to invade northern Sui, sometimes harassing Xinghe and Taolin, without any direction. According to a person from Jiabus in Temple on the 8th, a certain special agency in Jiabus in Temple issued a message that the Japanese Kwantung Army was extremely dissatisfied with the repeated counterattacks by the bandits and puppets. Therefore, it has ordered the leaders of the bandits and puppets not to allow any more defeats in the future. If anyone performs poorly in battle, their superiors will be questioned and severely punished. They will implement the use of the Jehol bandit army as the main force to invade Sui, ordering their regular troops to enter northern Chahar and occupy various places. As for the current strategy, because northern Sui is difficult to obtain, they have decided to invade Xinghe from the Southern Trench in eastern Sui, attempting to obtain Pingdiquan (Jining) to cut off the Ping-Sui Railway traffic and control the passage for Sui province's reinforcements and transportation. As for the puppet troops entrenched in the Southern Trench, they were originally the elite of Li Shouxin's troops, stationed in the Daqinggou area. Now, Li's troops are gradually moving to Shangdu and Jiabus in Temple, and there are very few remaining in the Southern Trench. Although Zhang Wanqing's brigade of Wang Ying's bandit troops in the Southern Trench is called two brigades, it actually has only about two thousand men. In addition, the rest are all Jehol bandits, Zhang Junzhe and Li Zhenming, who are constantly being supplemented. There are also many regular troops of a "certain party" mixed in. The total is more than six thousand people. Now, another three thousand Jehol bandits are concentrating in Shimulu in the Zhangbei County area and will go to the Southern Trench within days. According to the bandits and puppets, after ten thousand people have gathered in the Southern Trench, they will launch a fierce attack on Xinghe. On the evening of the 7th, more than a dozen commanders of a "certain party" arrived in Zhangbei from Jiabus in Temple. On the 8th, they went to the Southern Trench by car to take charge of commanding operations. It is expected that a fierce battle will break out there soon.</p>
<p>The "certain party" has driven all the bandits and puppets to the front line, and is using its regular troops and the Jehol puppet army to occupy northern Chahar, which was its original plan. Now that the two puppet forces of Wang Ying and Li Shouxin are almost eliminated, and the Mongolian puppet army is also taking care of itself, it is an excellent opportunity to implement its plan. Now, in addition to the Kawakishi Brigade stationed in northern Chahar, its regular troops and the Jehol puppet army have gradually moved into northern Chahar from Jehol recently. On the evening of the 7th, more than five thousand regular troops of a "certain party" and the Jehol puppet army, who had already arrived in Doron, headed west from Doron, and went to Kangbao, Tianchang, and Yulingou and Gaoshanpu in Guyuan County, to occupy key locations in northern Chahar. The rest of the troops are currently preparing to move west from Jehol. Since the "certain party" launched the Sui border war, a large number of military supplies have been transported from the Northeast or Tianjin to Zhangbei, constantly supplying the bandits and puppets. On the 1st of this month, they distributed more than 700,000 yuan in military pay to the bandits and puppets at the Jiabus Temple checkpoint. It is now heard that the "certain party" has another large batch of military supplies, transported from Tianjin to Zhangjiakou on the 6th, with a total of six train cars and 180 tons, which will be transported here by car and then distributed to the bandits and puppets in batches. Since the 6th, a large number of military supplies and needs have been transported from Zhangbei to the Southern Trench in the past few days. On the 8th, more than a dozen trucks of sacks were transported. It is said that after these sacks arrived in the Southern Trench that day, they were received by the traitor Zhang Wanqing. Zhang then ordered dozens of local laborers to fill each sack with yellow earth and then pile them outside the positions and trenches for cover. (8th)</p>
<h3>National Government Financial Advisor, Newson, Assassinated by Bandits in Henan; Newson Was the Manager of Xuchang Tobacco Company; An Employee of Xuchang Company Also Killed</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: Wu Tingsheng, manager of Xuchang Tobacco Company, was assassinated in Xuchang last winter, but the perpetrator remained at large. Wu’s son, Wu Shenxiong, accused Nie Wanqing and Yu Shijun in the Xuchang court of being the murderers of Wu. The court, finding the evidence insufficient, dismissed the case by the prosecutor. Wu Shenxiong then applied to the Henan High Court for reconsideration. The High Court transferred the case to the Zhengzhou District Court for jurisdiction and trial. After accepting the case, the court held several trials. Unexpectedly, before the verdict was announced, a witness (Wu Tingsheng's attendant) suddenly disappeared in Zhengzhou. The Zhengzhou court again declared the defendants Nie Wanqing, Yu Shijun, etc., not guilty due to insufficient evidence. It is said that the prosecutor of the Zhengzhou court will appeal this case. Unexpectedly, the Wu case has not yet been concluded, and the manager of Xuchang Tobacco Company, the American Newson, (a native of Salisbury, North Carolina, USA, currently 40 years old, whose wife and young daughter reside in Hankou, and his elderly mother still resides in his hometown, Newson currently serves as a financial advisor to the National Government) was robbed of his property and shot dead by bandits in his office at 6 p.m. on the 4th of this month. In addition, Guo Shuxian, an employee of the company, was injured and died one hour before Newson. A policeman outside the window of the office was also injured in the head by a bandit bullet. Fortunately, the injury was relatively minor, and if no other morbid conditions occur recently, his life can be saved without worry. After hearing the news, the reporter immediately went to Xuchang from Zhengzhou on the morning of the 5th to investigate and returned to Zhengzhou that evening. The details of the Newson case are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to Bi Zhiyun, director of the Xuchang Tobacco Company's tobacco factory, the situation of bandits rushing into the office to rob and shoot Newson and Guo Shuxian is as follows: The office of our company consists of eight interconnected rooms in two sections, four rooms on the east and four on the west, with a side passage in the middle. Newson's office is in the first room on the east side, and the lending room is in the fourth room on the west side. At about 6 p.m. that evening, while the lending office was distributing funds to tobacco farmers, a group of bandits suddenly rushed into the office. One bandit stood at the entrance of the office. There were two bandits entering the lending room, one guarding the outside and one inside. In the passageway of the office, there was an attendant sweeping the floor. Suddenly seeing the bandits, he immediately asked what they were doing. The bandits told him not to make a sound and went forward to take away his broom. The attendant, in a moment of urgency and resourcefulness, immediately ran out and shouted "Bandits! Bandits!" Newson, hearing the alarm, rushed into the lending room from his office with a handgun. At that time, Guo Shuxian, an employee in the lending room, was negotiating a loan with Zhou Jintang, manager of the Longhe Company. Suddenly hearing someone behind him, he turned around and saw a bandit standing there with a gun, telling him not to make a sound, and that they were only there for some money. Guo Shuxian immediately replied, "Please take whatever you want." The bandit then robbed the money being distributed on the table. At this time, Newson entered the room with a gun, pointing the muzzle at the bandit and asking what he was doing. The bandit, seeing the situation was not good, shouted loudly in the room, "Why not shoot?" (According to the bandit, "shoot" meant ordering the bandit standing outside the room to shoot Newson). The bandit standing outside the lending room heard the words and immediately shot Newson with a gun. The bullet entered from his right back and exited from his left chest, and he fell to the ground immediately. The bandit standing opposite Newson was also knocked down by him. The bandit quickly got up and shot Guo Shuxian in the room, the bullet hitting his forehead above the center of his eyebrows. The bullet did not exit, and Guo also fell to the ground in response. When the attendant, who was sweeping the floor in the passageway, ran out and shouted "Bandits!", the bandit guarding the door fired three shots at him, but missed. Another employee, Guan Jing, came out from the office opposite the lending room, and the bandit standing opposite Newson fired a shot at him. Unexpectedly, the gun misfired, and he was fortunate not to be injured. Seeing that the robbery was not going well, this bandit immediately returned to the lending room, snatched the gun held by Newson, and shouted, "Hurry, let's go!" At this time, a policeman was standing guard outside the window of the lending room. Seeing the bandit alarm, he looked for a hiding place, preparing to shoot the bandits. Unexpectedly, he was attacked from behind by another bandit with a shot, the bullet passing through the skin and breaking the bone on the upper right side of his head. He immediately fainted on the ground. According to the policeman, when he was injured and fainted, he was still mentally conscious and heard the bandits shout "Hurry, let's go!" and then they escaped out of the north gate of the courtyard. According to the doctors at the Xuchang American Hospital, after Newson and others were injured and carried into the hospital, Newson's bullet wound penetrated the heart through the spinal bone, entering from the back and exiting from the front chest. The specific vertebrae of the spine that were injured were not examined in detail. While he was being treated in the hospital, we told him that Newson's injuries were serious, but he was confident that his life was not in danger, saying, "It's okay, it's okay." But the fact that most of the blood from the gunshot wound did not flow out indicates that the fresh blood has entered the internal organs, and his life is in danger. Newson died of his injuries at 10:30 p.m. that evening. Guo Shuxian, who was killed at the same time as Newson, had a bullet shot into his head from the front upper forehead towards the back. The bullet did not exit. Because it hit a vital point, he lost too much blood and died an hour before Newson. Regarding the aftermath of Newson and Guo, the company has prepared a coffin to encoffinate Newson and transport him to Hankou on the 5th. Guo's coffin will be prepared and buried by Zhou Jintang, manager of the Longhe Company. The Fifth District Administrative Commissioner's Office is paying close attention to this case because Xuchang is the location of the Commissioner's Office, and bandits dared to rob with guns and injure people. It has ordered the arrest of the murderers and a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Drought and Food Shortage in Sichuan and Henan Provinces; Purchasing Large Quantities of Rice from Anhui Province; Wuhu Rice Market Becomes Active; Tianjin and Military Needs Also Compete to Purchase in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: This year, Henan Province has had little rainfall, resulting in a severe drought. The affected counties are estimated to be more than 70. The autumn harvest has already failed, and wheat has not been planted. Grain prices have soared, and the people lack food. The provincial Pingtiao Bureau, in charge of price stabilization, should purchase various grains from neighboring provinces with abundant harvests to regulate the market and alleviate the disaster. Since Anhui Province has sufficient grain and low prices, a letter was sent to the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce, instructing local grain merchants to quickly fill out a price list of various grains and send it as soon as possible for procurement. It was also requested that a list be sent every ten days thereafter for reference. Sichuan Province, also suffering from severe disasters and high grain prices, has sent personnel to Wuhu to purchase relief rice and transport it back to provide assistance. As a result, the rice market here has suddenly become active. In addition to Sichuan's relief rice and Tianjin's tobacco merchants competing for purchases, military demand is also very strong. The daily average transaction at the dock is 17,000 to 18,000 bags. Prices on the 10th were two dimes higher than on the 8th and 9th. Based on this, there is still a tendency for prices to continue to rise. Currently, the market price of September red glutinous rice is 10.34 to 10.56 yuan per stone, Zihuo 9.78 yuan, Nanling machine-milled Xian rice 9.34 yuan, brown rice 8.16 to 7.78 yuan, and Chao County and Yellow River sluice machine-milled rice both open at 9.23 yuan. Lujiang Ma Xian 9.34 yuan, machine-milled rice 8.78 to 9 yuan. As for yellow soybeans among miscellaneous grains, due to the recent increased demand from Yantai and other areas, people are scrambling to buy them, so sales are expanding. However, due to the scarcity of sources and insufficient inventory, prices have risen by more than one dime. On the 10th, 700 to 800 bags were traded at the dock, with Jiangbei yellow soybeans opening at 7.7 yuan, Zhongguang 7.45 yuan, and Zihuo 7.12 yuan (10th).</p>
<h3>Completion of Nine-Province Telephone Network; Wuhu-Hangzhou Calls Start on the 10th; Anhui Provincial Telephone Network Also Nears Completion</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The long-distance telephone lines of the nine provinces have been gradually completed in sections. Wuhu has already been connected to major ports such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Jiujiang, with clear sound, making it feel like being in the same room thousands of miles away. It is learned that the long-distance telephone lines between Wuhu and Hangzhou, Wuxing in Zhejiang, and Guanyun in Jiangsu will also start operation on the 10th. The fee from Wuhu to Hangzhou is one yuan per call, to Wuxing nine dimes, and to Guanyun one yuan and six dimes. The sending and receiving agencies are still located at the Wuhu Telegraph Office of the Ministry of Communications. As for the long-distance telephone lines between counties independently constructed by Anhui Province, more than 40 places have recently been completed. The counties in the second administrative district of Wuhu, and important counties such as Wuhu, Fanchang, Dangtu, and Xuancheng, have gradually been connected. The Wunan Line (Nanling County) telephone is also currently being installed. The Wuhu poles have been erected to the Sanbu tube. Once the engineering in Nanling County is completed, calls will also begin. However, due to the separation of Wuhu and Wuwei by the Yangtze River, the installation of underwater lines is a huge project. Although preparations are underway, it is feared that completion will be difficult in the short term (10th).</p>
<h3>Amidst Support for Suiyuan, Guangdong's Public Sentiment is Indignant and Agitated; Strict Prevention of People with Hidden Nationalities Mixing in Urban Areas; Patriots Organize Iron-Blood National Salvation Corps</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Amidst the urgent diplomatic situation, foreigners often mix in the markets in Guangzhou, or create incidents, hoping to cause trouble, or use leased shops to engage in smuggling. For example, recently at a certain hotel in Xidi, a foreigner and the person sitting next to him quarreled over a small matter, roaring and causing trouble in the shop. Afterwards, after the police mediated in many ways, they escorted the person back to the Shamian Concession, and the matter subsided. Not long after, cases of people of certain nationalities fraudulently leasing shops and disputes arising in Fengning Road and other places in the city occurred. The citizens are now automatically taking strict precautions. For any shops for rent, the rental declaration must state that the lessee must find a shop to guarantee that they are not a foreigner before renting. The police authorities also ordered each branch bureau to register any shops for rent in their jurisdiction. The landlord must not lease to foreigners without authorization. In addition, they ordered the patrolling police to pay attention to household registration movements. For long-term residents, they must pay attention to the landlord's actions and memorize the names of the householders and guests to prevent spies from mixing in. Recently, some people in the city have organized the Iron-Blood National Salvation Corps with the purpose of eliminating traitors, engaging in open activities in the city and sending people to distribute leaflets, explaining the definition of traitors as follows: (1) Using language, writing, or other methods to publicize the strength of the enemy, thereby anesthetizing and intimidating the Chinese people, so that consciously or unconsciously, they willingly submit to the enemy; (2) Reporting China's national defense equipment and plans, and plans and methods to prevent enemy invasion of China to the enemy; (3) Running errands and lobbying for the enemy or guiding the enemy to spy on various situations in China, in order to help the enemy invade China; (4) Colluding with the enemy to engage in smuggling and tax evasion; (5) Leasing or buying houses and land for the enemy; (6) Leasing or selling houses and land to the enemy with prior knowledge; (7) Colluding with the enemy with the intention of disrupting China's peace and order; (8) Harboring or hiding the enemy to plot wrongdoing, endangering China's public security; (9) Selling red pills, heroin, or other drugs to the enemy to harm the health of Chinese citizens; (10) Other acts willingly engaged in that benefit the enemy and harm China's national system, sovereignty, national interests, and social security. The above ten principles are the targets of the group's activities. It is said that if they are discovered in the city, they will be eliminated without hesitation or leniency and advise citizens not to intentionally or unintentionally act as accomplices for the enemy, cutting themselves off from their homes and country (December 6).</p>
<h3>Jiading: All Sectors Vigorously Support Suiyuan</h3>

The rural teachers from Kunshan, Jiading and Qingpu counties are donating their money that they saved from eating porridge. Other primary and secondary schools are all following the decisions of the education association, with teachers and staff donating one day's income each, and students saving their candy money to donate. In the industrial sector, the employees of the hardware cooperative factory have donated 136 yuan, and the workers of the Huacheng Electric Factory have donated 10 yuan. The Jiafeng Yarn Factory is still in progress. In the police sector, the officers and policemen of the county Public Security Bureau have donated 101 yuan. The business sector was notified by the county chamber of commerce yesterday that on the 15th of this month, regardless of the size of the business, each will donate according to their income.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Source of Deposits in the General Affairs Office</h3>
<p>Zhu Xingliang, the county accounting director, recently found a passbook in the general affairs office of the county government, with deposits of more than 18,000 yuan. Suspecting that it was suspicious, he seized the money and submitted it to the province for instructions. The source of this money has now been clarified as a special fund for the construction of county government warehouses. After this money was approved by the provincial department, the general affairs office of the county government immediately withdrew it from the fund management office, but did not deposit it into the treasury, and privately deposited the money into the bank, intending to obtain interest. Accounting Director Zhu Xingliang has reported the verified situation to the provincial department.</p>
<h3>Unified Price Increase in the Coal Industry</h3>
<p>Now that it is winter, coal sales have increased sharply. The local coal industry has recently uniformly increased prices due to a lack of sources and low inventory starting from the 11th. They have also stopped charging accounts and are trading in cash only. The highest grade white coal for stoves is sold at 34 yuan per ton, and bituminous coal is sold at 22 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Quartermaster Escapes with Funds, Burdening Guarantor</h3>
<p>Li Zuolin, the quartermaster of the 9th Battalion of the Security Brigade stationed in Kunshan, suddenly escaped with more than 3,000 yuan of public funds some days ago. The authorities immediately detained Li's wife, Cai, and Miao Jinzian, a waitress at the Wenming Garden. After interrogation, they were released on bail. It is learned that when Li took office, Xu Changhui, a local resident, acted as his guarantor. Since the escape, the authorities have instructed the guarantor to recover the funds. On the 10th, Xu had fully compensated the embezzled funds and strictly ordered the arrest of Li for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Construction of Roads in Xiangcheng Township</h3>
<p>Qin Xigui, the district chief of Xiangcheng Township in Wu County, initiated the construction of roads because of the inconvenient transportation in the township and the frequent incursions of bandits, which is adjacent to Cheng Lake, in order to facilitate transportation. The road starts from Xiangcheng Town, passes through Taiping Town to reach the Suchang Highway. The entire road is more than ten li long, and the road surface is three meters wide. The earthwork project has already been completed, but bridges and culverts have not been built due to funding constraints. The Wu County Construction Bureau has sent special personnel to survey and is about to start building bridges. It is expected to be completed in two months.</p>
<h3>Training of Commercial Organizations</h3>
<p>Wu County has decided to start the training of people's organizations with commercial organizations first. After the commercial organizations are trained, the freelance professional organizations will be trained. The commercial organizations were originally scheduled to start on the 7th, but were postponed due to the lack of hired instructors. It has now been decided to form teams on the 13th, and hold an opening ceremony at Zhongshan Hall on the morning of the 14th, and start training on the same day. The training will last for one month. Due to the large number of people, it will be held in two phases. The first phase has a total of 501 people. All members of the executive and supervisory committees of the various trade associations must be trained, but those who have received self-government training can be exempted from training. The courses are divided into academic courses and technical courses, each lasting two hours. All uniforms are to be provided by the individuals themselves.</p>
<h3>Clerk Sentenced for Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiongwu, a former clerk of the Civil Court of the Jiangsu High Court, was accused of smoking opium as a public official. He was sentenced to two years and six months in prison by the Wu County Government. The Jiangsu Provincial Government then ordered the county to retry the case. After the Wu County official retried the case, the verdict was issued yesterday. Zhu Xiongwu was given a reduced sentence of one year and six months in prison. The sentence will be carried out once it is approved.</p>
<h3>Testing of Women's First Aid Class</h3>
<p>The Women's First Aid Class founded by the Wu County Women's Association, with more than 100 students, has now completed its training period. The test will be held at Zhongshan Hall at 2:00 p.m. on the 12th. If the test is passed, certificates will be issued. The second phase may be postponed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Strict Enforcement of Grain Storage Control</h3>
<p>In order to prepare for grain storage and regulate people's food, the Resources Committee has strictly enforced grain storage control. All local grain storage, whether owned by the government or public by local organizations, may not be used without the approval of the provincial government. The provincial government has sent committee member Zhang Zhongyu to inspect Wuxi, Wu County, Wujiang and other three counties to assess the situation. The counties have been ordered to complete all procedures before the 15th of this month. After receiving the order, Long County magistrate of this county yesterday ordered the district chiefs to report the number of grain stored in this county within three days of receiving the document, in order to compile and forward it.</p>
<h3>Active Grain Market</h3>
<p>The local grain market has been quite active recently. Sailing ships are connected in the ponds and rivers around Beichang Sanliqiao, transporting rice up and down, and the situation is very tense. Next to the railway station, there are also piles of grain waiting for transportation by train. All rice mills on Jiangjianshang are working day and night to mill rice for sale at good prices. According to people in the rice industry yesterday, there are two reasons for the activity in the rice market: (1) The number of rice merchants coming to Xik to buy grain this year is more than in previous years, with some coming from as far as Xi'an and Tianjin, and some coming from counties such as Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Nanhui. (2) In recent years, agricultural warehouses have been established everywhere, so they are buying rice and grain for storage in preparation for famine relief. Therefore, the rice market is strong and there is no hope of decline. The prosperity of the rice shops is the greatest it has been in more than ten years.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Robbery and Injury in Lushu Township</h3>
<p>Wu Yuansheng, a resident of Lushu Township in the third district of Wu County, is from a well-to-do family and has long been coveted by bandits. In the late hours of the 8th of this month, armed bandits suddenly broke down the door and entered his house to search and rob. The owner, Wu Yuansheng, woke up in his sleep and was unable to escape. He was grabbed, bound, and beaten by the bandits, suffering serious injuries. The bandits searched for a long time. Because the wind outside was urgent, they took the stolen goods and howled away. After checking, they found that they had been robbed of field deeds, clothes, and copper and tinware, suffering heavy losses. The district chief of the district, Zhu Tianying, reported the matter. Yesterday, he specially submitted the report to the county government, requesting strict arrest of the stolen goods and bandits for investigation and handling. It is also heard that Wu Yuansheng's family had previously been searched by bandits Zhong Koulin and others who have been executed, and a child was taken away.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Market Strike in Shazhou</h3>
<p>Wu Huaiqin, the captain of the Shazhou Bridgehead Street Justice and Brave Ding Team in the third district, reported to the Yangku Public Security Third Branch that it was difficult to collect monthly donations, and detained Deng Ronggen, Fang Yunhua and other three merchants, arousing great public anger among more than 120 merchants in the town. The day before yesterday, they jointly went on strike, unanimously supporting them, and demanded the release from the branch. The situation may escalate.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Verdict on Arson Case Due to Unrequited Love</h3>
<p>Bao Ling, a well-known socialite in Tongcheng, once cohabited with Chen Zhensheng, the owner of the Sanyang Food Store, but recently suddenly broke up. After Chen Zhensheng's unrequited love, he attempted to extort money but failed and set fire to her house. The Public Security Bureau arrested him and sent him to the court. On the 10th, the criminal court concluded the trial. Chen Zhensheng was sentenced to twelve years in prison for extortion and arson.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Soybean Oil Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Soybean oil is a daily necessity. Recently, due to the shortage of raw materials and large-scale purchases by a certain country, the price of soybean oil has soared. On the 8th of this month, it was sold for 23.2 yuan per load, which is more than 4 yuan higher than before, and there is still a tendency for prices to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Thoroughly Reorganize Land Tax</h3>
<p>The amount of arrears of old land tax in various counties of Jiangsu Province over the years is very large. Although the Finance Department has repeatedly decided to clear it up, the people are accustomed to the accumulated habits and it is difficult to thoroughly do so. Recently, the department revised the liquidation methods and submitted them to the provincial government meeting for approval. It is heard that the amount of land tax arrears in the counties from the 16th year of the Republic of China to the end of June this year, only the provincial regular tax item, reached more than 10 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Rice Shops Change to Pawnshops for Warehousing</h3>
<p>The rice market outside Bianyimen in Yangzhou has always absorbed rice from the lower reaches of the river and transported it to various ports outside the Yangtze River, which is the main business. This year, due to the cheap rice in the south, the rice from the lower reaches is transported to the upper reaches for sale, resulting in a shortage of rice and the rice market is almost in a steep decline. Recently, there have been five companies that have announced their closure, and many more are on the verge of collapse. However, it is heard that Fucheng and Yulong have changed their operations to pawnshops due to the current situation. All rice and wheat transported are absorbed, valued at ten yuan and pledged for eight yuan. They charge storage rent and interest, and the business is still good. They have already stockpiled more than 40,000 stones. General speculators regard it as a stock exchange, receiving goods, mortgaging goods, and turning around busily, resulting in the rice price on the 9th and 10th increasing by about one yuan per stone. People in the industry said that during the winter when the water dries up and the green seedlings do not connect next spring, it will be possible to obtain special benefits by hoarding rice. Therefore, rice shops with insufficient general economies are even more affected.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Famine Victims Arrive in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>On the night of the 9th, 186 famine victims from Anhua, Hunan, suddenly arrived in Kongjia kiln, Duntou Township, in the fourth district of Jiangdu. The township head, Hu Derong, immediately reported to the fourth district office. The district chief, Liu Zhaorong, ordered township officials Gao Xiang and others to be responsible for expelling them. They have already left the border overnight. It is heard that they are begging along the way and maintaining order, without causing any disturbance.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang: Accelerating the Dredging of Huai River, Working Overtime</h3>
<p>The earthwork for dredging the Huai River assigned to Huai'an, Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Siyang counties has completed more than 80% so far, but accumulated sections are inevitable. The governments of the four counties have received orders from the province to increase labor and work overtime, in order to release water on New Year's Day of the 26th year without error. Among the four counties, Huai'an has the most unfinished earthwork, amounting to 2 million cubic meters. Therefore, the quota for additional labor in the county is also higher than in other counties, totaling 120,000 people. Zhang Guoqiong, the supervising officer sent by the provincial government, is stationed in the county to urge the work. The other three counties, Huaiyin, Lianshui, and Siyang, have half the number of additional labor as Huai'an, with Lianshui and Siyang having half the number of Huaiyin. In short, in order to avoid delays, the counties are adding night shifts to speed up the removal of earth in addition to the day shifts, so there is no difference.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing: Urging Commercial Registration</h3>
<p>Since the commercial registration of Jiaxing has been planned and assisted by the County Chamber of Commerce, most of them have been fulfilled. A small number of merchants still hold a wait-and-see attitude, although the County Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly decided to send personnel to persuade them. Now, in order to complete the general registration within the time limit, the county government has sent many policemen to supervise the various sections and fill out the forms within a limited time. If the deadline is exceeded, the police will be ordered to detain and punish them. Yesterday, Xiangyuan and other numbers were detained and fined.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Evening's Xiqing Basketball: Xin Team Loses Again to Maling Jia; 35 to 55; Uninspired Performance; Lu Zhongen and Locke Get into a Fight</h3>
<p>Xiqing Basketball: Last night, Xin Team lost again to Maling Jia by a score of 35 to 95. Xin Team's hopes in the Independent Group seem to be distant. What is even more unfortunate is that, three or four minutes before the end of the game, Lu Zhongen and Locke suddenly got into a fight. Fortunately, it was quickly resolved, and both players left the court, allowing the game to finish safely. In terms of performance, Xin Team is indeed inferior to Maling Team. Both offense and defense lack characteristics. Maling Team led all the way. Xin Team was always at a disadvantage. In the first half, Maling Team led 31 to 17. There was also a university group game, in which Fudan defeated Tongji, 68 to 20. The first half was 41 to 8. In a Group B game, Moor defeated the Philippines, 45 to 12. Xin Team was defeated by Maling Jia, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Failure: There are two reasons for Xin Team's failure. One is that Xin Team's defense is too poor. Among the five players, Xu Wenkui is simply unable to defend. During Maling's fierce attacks, Xu is often seen standing in another corner. As a result, gaps are frequently exposed. Maling's five players are seen entering and exiting Xin Team's basket non-stop. In addition, Maling is tall, making it difficult for Xin Team to defend, resulting in numerous fouls. As a result, they vent their anger on Maling through the referee's free throws, which is unwise for Xin Team. As for the offense, Maling's five-man zone defense is extremely tight, making it difficult for Xin Team to handle. Maling's shooting is not very good, and there are many opportunities. If each shot were successful, Xin Team would have lost even more completely.</p>
<p>Collapsing After Contact: After the initial contact, Maling rushed to the basket and shot repeatedly, without success. Xu Wenkui turned around and got the ball, opening the scoring. Locke and Xianglong, etc., scored on each other, tying the score at 5. This was the most intense period. From then on, Xin Team collapsed. Maling added more than ten points, leading Xin Team 18 to 7. Although Xianglong, Wenkui, and Nianhua regained five points, they were ultimately unable to stop Maling's momentum. The scores between the two sides became further and further apart. After 25 to 12, Maling continued to add points. The result of the first half was 31 to 17, a difference of 14.</p>
<p>Fight Occurs: From the beginning of the second half, Maling continued to take a fierce offensive. It is a pity that the shooting technology, so although in the basket repeatedly hovering, for a long time no score, Xu Wenkui from afar in a ball after, Feng Nianhua four decided to foul out, Maling's score, and suddenly see rising, into thirty-nine than twenty-two, the difference and for seventeen points of the giant, Xianglong Wenkui, although repeatedly trying, always so far away, not easy to change, forty-nine than thirty points, Lu Zhongen see live Locke in his basket next to, accidental misunderstanding, Locke nature, both hands on the Punch, reconciliation after the same field, Hua Fenggang substitution, fifty-four to twenty-three, Xianglong also punish, Xin Team in four people to deal with the final, the results of fifty-five to thirty-five.</p>
<p>Fudan Wins Over Tongji</p>
<p>In the university group, Fudan won over Tongji. Many of Tongji's official players were absent, making them no match for Fudan. In the first half, Fudan scored 41 points, while Tongji only had 8 points.</p>

<h3>Securities: Situation is Stable; Public Bond Market Rebounds; Large Financial Institutions Sell Less -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market in the China Merchants Securities Exchange rebounded strongly, and prices also rose. The powerful large financial institutions have gradually reduced their actual selling, and the market's popularity is still very strong. The amount of absorption by retail investors has increased. The market situation is based on the stability of the situation and the vigorous buying sentiment from all parties, rising from hovering. However, the brewing of the current bond market, the competition between long and short is quite fierce, and it is a sign of a major change in the future. Yesterday, the Shanghai market opened, and people's hearts were very settled. Retail investors absorbed a lot. Thirty-five point four bonds also poured in for buying, while forty-three point thirty-seven bonds were still sold, but because the chips were not many, market prices all rebounded by five points to half a yuan. Ding Mao in this month was tired by five points. The closing trend continued to show strength.

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: The Marked Yarn Market is Mediocre; Although China Cotton Company Comes to Buy; It Eventually Falls Due to Unsatisfactory Actual Sales</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and tired, and the momentum has a downward trend. Because the yarn sales are stagnant, various gangs have a one-time end due to the year-end relationship, so business is particularly deserted. The current yarn price is falling step by step. However, China Cotton Company and others have not accumulated inventory, and the factory base has not been greatly loosened. The concept of long positions has not been released. There is also news that a certain factory may hand over 10-count cotton yarn. In short, the price has reached a high level, and the delivery will of course increase if it is light, so it is said.</p>
<p>The marked yarn market was weak in the pre-market without ups and downs. The Qingdao yarn factory was completely back in operation, the yarn price there fell, and the current yarn sales stopped, and people's hearts were scattered. The Osaka goods yarn also showed an unpleasant hovering state. Some peers tend to go short. The second and third rounds fell back to the closing price, because China Cotton Company suddenly did not absorb and increase positions, and each month jumped up by one yuan, and the forward price was still flat, but the current yarn business was very clear. The result of the marked yarn was that each month was unchanged compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was mediocre when the market opened in the afternoon. There was very little on the market, and there were not many transactions. The closing time was very early, probably because both sides were exhausted after rising sharply in the morning. Continued with the sluggish yarn sales, as a result, each month fell by nine, six, and seven jiao compared to the closing price in the morning. Check that Jin Chang actually came out with 1,900 bales, Yu Da with 850 bales, Zhen Da with 800 bales, Sen Kang with 4,050 bales, Wang Taixing with 2,100 bales, Fu Kang with 1,400 bales, Tonghe with 1,000 bales, Shenji with 800 bales, Da Chang with 1,250 bales, and Yong Chang with 550 bales.

<p>The spot yarn fell by four yuan. The spot yarn sales market is still sluggish. Check that the total statistics of each gang bought 440 bales throughout the day, and the selling price fell by four yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<h3>Longs Return to Selling; Futures Cotton Intends to Advance but Retreats; But Because the Price Difference Between Yarn and Cotton is Still Willing; Some Peers Are Still Buying In</h3>
<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell, and the market situation was slightly mixed. However, the Indian cotton market continued to rise, so the long attitude was strong. The current saying is that the yarn price has repeatedly reached peaks, and the cotton price is too far apart. At present, farmers in various villages are vigorously rejecting the price of farmland, and the selling price is not willing to loosen, so the pulling force is still strong.</p>
<p>The marked cotton closing saw a setback. The marked cotton market opened in the pre-market, because the US flower cotton market unanimously continued to rise, and the momentum was fierce, and people's hearts were more firm. Some peers thought that the yarn market was high and the cotton price had not risen, and they were optimistic about the cotton price, and the absorption was also huge, so the stage turned beautiful, and each month rose by three and a half jiao. The second round slightly fell back, and the third round rose again. As a result, each month rose by two jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, a certain household continued to sell fiercely, and at the same time, some long positions sold. The market price was 900 dan, Hengyi 3,000 dan, Yuda 2,400 dan, Dafeng 3,100 dan, Gengfeng 1,400 dan, Fengtai 2,700 dan, Renfeng 6,600 dan, Yuan Yi 6,800 dan, Run Kang 1,800 dan, Tonghe 1,000 dan, Xincheng 23,000 dan, Changyu 5,100 dan, and Yicheng 6,900 dan.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Tongyao flowers and other arrivals are cut off. The current cotton consumption is still quite thin. The source of Yao flowers is 1,280 bales, and Tong flowers is 1,960 bales.</p>
<h3>The Marked Cotton Formation is Expanding; The Running Inventory is Over 410,000 Dan</h3>
<p>Because the speculative target has shifted to marked cotton, the marked stock account volume of the China Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange is worth considering. As of December 9, check that the February futures turnover was 229,800 dan, the January futures turnover was 479,200 dan, the February futures turnover was 455,200 dan, and the March futures turnover was 548,500 dan, totaling 1,712,700 dan. After deducting the long and short stock accounts, the net stock volume was 415,700 dan. Check that there are 25 short positions and 39 long positions. The households with the largest buying and selling are extracted as follows:</p>
<h3>More Buyers; Foreign Cotton All Reported Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened, and each month rose by two to ten pounds of sound. Early in the morning, domestic and foreign peers bought in batches at limited prices, and speculators also had new buys. The market situation was quite lively. Then, due to the uncertainty of the British political situation and the flatness and fatigue of other prices, cotton prices also slightly fell back. The old longs since summer have mostly closed, but they were immediately absorbed by people. The current demand is relatively stagnant, and the manufacturers are very frightened of the situation in the market. Before the closing, cotton farmers sold short, and some returned to small, and when the market closed, the public bought again and turned high again. The spot price rose by 14 pounds of sound, and the futures price rose by 12 to 21 pounds of sound. The spot price of British cotton rose by four points, and the futures price rose by three or four points. The Indian cotton initially rose due to futures traders buying, and then there were mutual buys and sells. In the end, operators actively bought and rose again. Before the closing, the longs closed, and the peers bought Pingguer and Aomula. Pingguer rose by 2.5 to 2.75 Robbie, Aomula rose by 2 to 2.5 Robbie, and Bairuo Creek rose by 1.75 Robbie. The original electricity record is on the left (10th electricity).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai electricity, the opening forecast for the 11th, Bairuo Creek was 223 and a half Robbie, Aomula was 204 and a half Robbie, and Pingguer was 165 and a half Robbie, all up by 1.25 Robbie.</p>
<p>Three Types of Yarn and Flowers Rose and Fell Intermittently</p>
<p>On the 11th, the Osaka electricity, the three types of futures yarn rose by one jiao to fell by eight jiao, the near month was 246 yuan and three jiao, and the far month was 224 yuan and three jiao. The futures cotton rose by two jiao to fell by two jiao, the near month was 68 yuan and four jiao, and the far month was 70 yuan and two jiao.</p>
<h3>Grain: There is a Saying That Foreign Wheat Will Continue to be Ordered; The Market Price of Futures Wheat is Seeing Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed a uniform loosening and falling trend in each month. Although the quotation of foreign wheat had few ups and downs, because there were rumors that foreign wheat would continue to be ordered, people's hearts were often soft. The price of goods has been too high after all, and the reverse change cannot be predicted. Therefore, the market situation was cold, the transaction was very small, and the price fell by two, three, seven, and eight points. Until the market opened at noon, the transactions in each market had been smoother, and the price hovered, with not much ups and downs. According to the current situation, if foreign wheat is gradually ordered, some of the speculations in this and other places must be abandoned, and the change in the market may also be inevitable. In the dan wheat market, because the standard was loosened and fell, each middle and second gear also shouted small. The Kaishan Dong Yaowan wheat was 6 yuan, 6 jiao and 7 fen, the Bengbu Guandian Xia Shi wheat was 6 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, the Huaicheng wheat was 6 yuan, 6 jiao and 2 fen, the Wuhu Wuxi wheat was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, the Jiangbei wheat was 6 yuan, 6 jiao, the second was 5 jiao and 7 fen, and the Shaoxing wheat was 6 yuan, 5 jiao and 2 fen, the second was 5 jiao. Fuxin handled 10,000 bags, and Fufeng handled 20,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>Futures Flour Floats and Many Rise Up from the Cage - The Market Price Gradually Decreases -</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, each month showed a initial determination and then gradually fell miserably. According to the quotation of foreign wheat, there was a slight difference of about one jiao between Chicago and Canada, while Liverpool was better at one office. Therefore, people's hearts were still determined when the price was opened, and the factories recently made up for the recent period, and gradually sold in the long term. However, it was said that there were thousands of tons of foreign wheat sold in the recent orders, and the price was 5 jiao and 2 fen, or 7 fen. Therefore, many floating traders in the market came to the market one after another, and the general wait-and-see speculators also took the opportunity to sell, causing the market to enter the downstream. Until the market opened in the afternoon, the situation was even weaker, because the retail investors all came out together, and the market was greatly declining. However, although the non-industry longs have returned in the recent period, they have tried their best to pull in the long term, resulting in fatigue and recovery. The drop in one day has reached six or seven fen. According to the speculation of people in the industry, although foreign wheat has begun to be ordered, the market value is not suitable, and the softness of people's hearts is only a temporary impulse. In the future, if the order price is cheap, the future will be unthinkable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Pours in and Sales are Also Strong</h3>
<p>The Ke Xian market is in a two-flat situation. In recent days, the arrival has been tens of thousands of bags a day, and the sales have also been close to tens of thousands of bags. Moreover, Wei, the Quanzhou Gang's agent, has been selling three or five thousand bags a day. The Henan Gang is also continuously handling the installation, and yesterday there were more embellishments from the North Gang and the Shao Gang. The sales of the street and the hoarders are also strong. Therefore, at the time when the Ke rice poured in and the stock was sufficient, the market could still stand firm. However, the Cantonese Gang paid attention to the direct installation of Hunan rice and the tax reduction of foreign rice, and the sales were delayed for a long time, which was the obstacle to the rice market. Yesterday, the whole day's opening was 7,130 bags of Gan rice, 915 bags of Hunan rice, thousands of bags of Wentai rice, and 480 bags of Guangdong machine rice. The price was similar to the previous market, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Main Street of Food Rice Still Has a Smooth Exit</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the source of each gang was slightly scarce due to being blocked by heavy fog the night before, with a total of more than 90 numbers arriving, with a total of 18,3400 shi of goods, including more than 60 numbers of thin rice. The sales market on the main street continued to be quite good due to the rain, and it was still quite active. However, the stomach moves, which is not pleasant. Although there are more than 7,000 bags of thin rice and more than 3,000 bags of thick japonica handled by the Pingjin Qingyan Gang, the result is that the price of thin rice is fixed, and the thick japonica seems to have a clear and dark increase trend due to the good sales on the main street. The early rice, which has already seen Xiujinjiao, has also increased by a jiao. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuanxifu have all turned to show nearly a foot.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, five or sixty boats from the river gangs arrived, and the goods on the market continued to move. The price of white japonica rice was firm and beautiful, and the price of Yangdu Kejian increased by Sanjiangfen. The tip of the port was also tight. The goods with high tops of thin rice were flat and tired, and the price of the middle and second was slightly close to the corner. The white yuan wrapped stomach was also handled, and the retail store stomach also had sales, and the market price rose by two or three jiao. The prices of the remaining goods were firm.</p>
<h3>The Standard Chips are Exhausted; Foreign Zhuang Sesame is Raised to 14 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign Zhuang sesame reached the 14 yuan mark. The Central Trust Bureau handled 1,000 tons, and the Japanese Foreign Firm collected 400 tons (a total of 16,800 bags). The sellers were released by the Zhenjiang Gang and general longs. The overall situation was still tight, because the chips were gradually exhausted, and the standard of the exchange was rising, which made people's hearts flourish. As a result, the spot rough sesame sales market was also strong. The Shao Gang's oil extraction route was continuously unremitting. More than 400 bags of each sesame were traded yesterday, and the market continued to be tight by one or two jiao.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Spring Piece Goods - The Volume of Futures Transactions is Significantly Reduced</h3>
<p>The reason is that they dare not open easily</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, due to the continuous fatigue of the yarn market and the high price of cloth, it was guarded against its reverse movement. The year-end results are about to come, and the needs of the Jinlu Shu inland and the main street are still strong, but I am afraid that the period is extremely short, and the arrival of goods from Qingdao and Changxi Nantong and other districts will gradually increase. Most of them are to pay off the cheap roots, which gradually weakens people's popularity. There have been low-priced sales, and white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill have fallen back by about five fen per piece. Coarse cloth, raw cloth, and flannel are still firm, but heavy-weight goods occasionally fall back by five fen or one jiao. The trend of colored cloth is also very ordinary. Thread flannel is firm because the inventory is empty and the bottom of the printed goods is not high. The factory's opening of goods is few, and there are slight spot transactions. Yesterday, the Beilu purchased spot goods and distributed 200 pieces of white twill flannel heavy-weight coarse cloth serge thread flannel. The Shu Gang is enthusiastically installing thread flannel straight tribute and a small number of blue cloth colored twill. The main street and the Jiangzhe inland gangs are very eager to search for light-weight coarse cloth. There is a lack of spot goods on the market, so it is very lively. Other fine cloth, fine twill raw cloth have all reduced the handling of spring poplin. In previous years, futures transactions were very busy at this time. This year, because the yarn thread is high and the weaving households lack confidence, except for the previous opening of more than 1,000 boxes of spot and futures by Guangzhong and other companies, there is no news of further sales at present, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Indian Zhuang Persian Silk Sales are Still Active</h3>
<p>- There are Continued Sales of Jili Silk -</p>
<p>The overseas silk market is still trending downstream. Yesterday, the New York December standard silk fell by three and a half points, and the futures fell by half a point. Yokohama spot opened at the original price of the previous day, and the forward price rose slightly by three yuan. The market is still difficult to recover, and the silk sales in the United States and France have become silent. The routes of Indian Zhuang and Persia are still active. Yesterday, a considerable number of Jili silk continued to be sold, and the price was quite stable. Domestic sales of silk were very deserted yesterday, and there were few transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3>There are Slight Sales of Cored Zhenmei</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Tunxi Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea, Yongxing Yihe Huacha and other firms all slightly entered the stomach, and more than 100 boxes were traded in the city. Tunzhuang famous core-drawing goods opened at 96 yuan at the top, and ordinary duanzhuang goods opened at 52 yuan, both of which were unchanged from before. As for Jinlong Foreign Firm, the large amount of Zhenmei transaction previously opened with each tea station is currently being telegraphed abroad for negotiation due to price issues, it is said.</p>
<h3>Metals　Tinplate Spot Goods in Great Shortage</h3>
<p>Thick tinplate, recently, due to purchases by toy factories, etc., and also with many inquiries from thermos bottle factories, the market situation is good, and the market price, due to environmental factors, appears even more brisk, estimated at 3 jiao 4.5 fen per pound. Moreover, Japanese parties have recently entrusted people in Shanghai to make purchases, resulting in a great shortage of spot goods and a more solid market trend. It is reported that over two hundred boxes were opened yesterday, with prices of 4 jiao 5 fen for No. 22, 3 jiao 5 fen for No. 24, 3 jiao 2 fen for No. 26, and 2 jiao for No. 27.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Over a Thousand Pieces of Green Slab Sugar from Shek Mun Anticipated for Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little change. The guild's price for existing stock of No. 24 coarse white sugar was 21.55 yuan, while re-exported goods were at 6.125 yuan. Dong Bai Nos. 4 and 8 remained at their original prices, but No. 9 decreased slightly by 0.05 yuan. Existing stock of YRO marked sugar was 21 yuan, and re-exported goods were at 5.9 yuan. Mian Bai No. 1 from the local factory, Zhen Ji, was 20.4 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 followed suit. The price board listed over a thousand pieces of green slab sugar from Shek Mun, to be delivered in one week, at a price of 10.05 yuan to 10.45 yuan.</p>
<p>The joint venture company yesterday held its third tender for Cantonese sugar this week, with a total fixed quota of 10,789 bags. The bid prices remained as before. 770 bags of coarse white sugar from the Shunde factory, Five Rams brand, were sold at 21.3 yuan; 100 bags from the City New Factory were sold at 21.1 yuan; 15 bags from Shantou were sold at 20.9 yuan; and another 50 bags were sold at 20.7 yuan, for a total of 935 bags sold.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Dried Longan Slightly Dropping by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The sales of dried longan have recently slowed down, and there have been no new shipments of high-quality goods. After investigating, over a hundred pieces have arrived, but have not yet been put on the market. It is rumored that some are eager to sell off small quantities, leading to a slight decrease of one or two yuan in the black market. This has already happened. As for Hainan goods, the stock is relatively abundant, but due to cost considerations, there is little hope of a significant price drop. The future market will depend on sales picking up before bulk transactions can occur.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cultural Circles: Banquet for Tian Bo Lie Last Night; Tian Visited Mayor Wu and Attended a Welcome Banquet; Lecture at the YMCA This Afternoon at 4 PM</h3>
<p>Tian Bo Lie, President of the International Historical Society and Professor at Cambridge University, a world-renowned historian, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday during his world tour and is staying at the International Hotel. At 11:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by Kang Xuan Yi, he went to the city center to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The Mayor received him in the reception room on the third floor, expressing deep admiration for this scholar of the era and inviting him to stay in Shanghai for a few more days. Afterwards, he visited the construction in the city center. At noon, the Mayor hosted a banquet at his private residence on Haige Road to welcome Mr. Tian, inviting Chen Guangfu, Yang Guangxing, Guo Bingwen, Cai Zengji, and Kang Xuanyi, among others, to accompany. At 5:30 PM, he went to the China Funeral Home to pay respects to Huang Fu. At 7:00 PM, the International Affairs Research Society, the Universal Student Association, the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, the Professor Writers Association, and the Peking University Alumni Association, among other groups, hosted a welcome banquet for Mr. Tian at the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge. Attendees included Mayor Wu (represented by Pan Gongzhan), Cui Wei Wu, Zhang Shouyong, Li Dachao, Yan Fuqing, Li Ximou, Jiang Jianbai, Kang Xuanyi, Zhu Shaoping, Li Guansan, Du Gangbai, Chen Hongfan, Chen Derong, Ding Zheming, Yu Liang, Cui Xiaocen, Deng Qingshan, He Zhenya, Wang Chuntao, Bao Tianxiao, and Mr. and Mrs. Tian Bo Lie, among others, totaling several dozen people. First, Jiang Jianbai delivered a welcome speech on behalf of everyone, translated by Dai Baozhao, stating that Mr. Tian Bo Lie is a world-renowned historical expert, and China is an ancient country with a long history of civilization, so there is a real need for research methods on history. Mr. Tian Bo Lie's visit to China will surely provide people with practical instructions, so that the research methods of Chinese and foreign history can be integrated into one. Therefore, I represent everyone to express sincere welcome. Then, Mayor Wu delivered a speech on behalf of Director Pan, briefly saying that it is of profound significance that today the cultural groups of this city welcome Mr. Tian Bo Lie. Everyone knows that Mr. Tian has many extremely valuable works, such as the Paris Peace Conference, Historical Materials of the European War, and England and the Near East, etc. Not only are the materials collected rich and authentic, but they have also greatly contributed to the communication of human civilization and the promotion of peace. This time, Mr. Tian Bo Lie's visit to the Far East for exploration and investigation will surely make the actual situation in the Far East clear to the world, which will also have a great relationship with world peace. The International Historical Society organized by Mr. Tian Bo Lie has already been joined by forty-two countries, and Japan has recently joined. We want to take this opportunity to arouse the attention of domestic cultural circles to join the association. The cultural circles in the capital and Peiping have already expressed their intention to join, and it is hoped that the cultural circles in this city will also make the same expression. This should be welcome news to Mr. Tian Bo Lie, and I hope that after the annual meeting is held in Switzerland in 1938, the annual meeting in 1940 can be held in China. We will sincerely welcome Mr. Tian Bo Lie and all members. Finally, I hope that Mr. Tian Bo Lie can visit universities in China, such as Dewey's, and I wish Mr. and Mrs. Tian good health. Then, Mr. Tian Bo Lie gave a speech, briefly saying, I am very grateful for the welcome from the cultural circles in your place today. I have been to several places since I came here. What impressed me the most is that everything in your country shows vitality. Whether in cultural, military, or political circles, there are extremely many young people. This is clear evidence, so I predict that China will have a bright future. The reason why I came to your country this time is that due to time constraints, I have not yet prepared for writing. What I hope for from the cultural circles of your country is that in the future they can join the International Historical Society, because this association has already been joined by more than 40 countries, which will enable the cultural circles of China to communicate with the cultural circles of various countries in the future. For example, Mr. Hu Shih in the cultural circles of your country has a very good reputation in the world. I hope that in the future, he can work with the cultural circles of your country to participate in international cultural work, so as to enhance the purpose of international cultural undertakings. Mr. Tian is scheduled to give a public lecture at the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge at 4:30 PM today, with the topic being "International Situation and Internationalism," which will surely be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Annals Hall Obtains: The Shanghai County Annals of the Hongzhi Era of the Ming Dynasty, The First Annals of Shanghai County, Missing for More Than 250 Years</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Annals Hall has been dedicated to compiling and researching the historical facts of various departments in Shanghai, and has long been recognized internationally for its reputation. Its interviews and collection of works related to Shanghai are also highly praised by the people of the country. Recently, the hall obtained the Shanghai County Annals of the Hongzhi Era of the Ming Dynasty, which can be regarded as an unprecedented achievement. According to the Shanghai County Annals, there are a total of ten copies from the Ming Dynasty to the present. The first copy was compiled by Tang Jin in the seventeenth year of Hongzhi (1504). This record was not seen when the record was revised in the twenty-second year of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty (1683). Since then, it has never been found during the revision of the record in various dynasties. The Shanghai Municipal Annals Hall has made great efforts to collect Shanghai records from past dynasties, and has paid more attention to the Hongzhi record, conducting interviews everywhere. It was learned that the Hongzhi record was still left in the Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo. Overjoyed, it began negotiations with Tianyi Pavilion in the summer of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China to copy and print it. In the autumn of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the hall commissioned Xu Weixuan, a teacher at Ningbo Girls' High School, to directly negotiate with Mr. Feng Mengzhen of the Tianyi Pavilion Reconstruction Committee, and then obtained a photograph and transcription, and Mr. Xu carefully proofread it. As a result, the Shanghai County Annals of Hongzhi, which had been unseen for more than 250 years, was returned to its hometown. This is indeed a major contribution of the Shanghai Municipal Annals Hall to the city.</p>
<h3>Lie Feng Silk Factory Increases Wages: Settlement Minutes Signed Yesterday, Stipulating Wage Rates for Sanmin Ni, etc.</h3>

Li Weixiong from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Wu Jian, a representative of the workers, and Xu Zhongfu, a representative of the capitalists, etc. arrived. After persuasion, they agreed to sign a settlement, stipulating that the wages for Er Sanmin Ni will be 0.096 yuan, and the wages for other new patterns will be 0.117 yuan.

<h3>Yi Zhong Pudong Factory: Labor Dispute Resolved, Settlement Minutes Signed Yesterday</h3>

The two parties agreed and signed the settlement minutes, stipulating: (1) Starting from January next year, the factory shall, depending on their daily performance and diligence, moderately increase the wages of other workers, except for a few workers with poor work performance and new workers. (2) All workers who continue to work for a full month without interruption due to any reason shall be rewarded with one day of work. (3) Regardless of whether they are male or female workers, those who work on Sundays or night shifts shall be paid an additional 20% of their monthly wages.</p>
<h3>Shoulder Carriers in the Fourth District: Workers Petitioned Yesterday Morning, Asking to Abolish Contracting and Restore Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fourth District Shoulder Carriers Industry Union and the capitalist Guangbang Lianyi Hall have been in a dispute over exploitation by contractors, which has been mediated by the Ningbo and Guangdong native place associations to no avail. More than a hundred workers, due to livelihood reasons, petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday morning with a written request, and walked to the front of the Public Security Bureau in the city center. Because of the large number of people, they were dissuaded by the police officers of the branch bureau. All the workers changed and elected five representatives, including Tang Shanlin, to go to the Bureau of Social Affairs to demand the abolition of the contracting system and the restoration of workers' jobs. The director of the mediation division, Wang Xianqing, received them and promised to find a way to mediate immediately, and advised the workers to wait patiently for a solution.</p>
<h3>Baohua and Three Other Factories: Workers Continue to Strike, Labor Proposes Five Demands, and Sets Today to Petition Separately</h3>
<p>Dagon News Agency reported that more than 500 workers from the Maihua, Yuyu and Youyi factories on Bailinan Road in West Shanghai implemented a strike since 8:00 PM the night before, and then immediately held an emergency meeting in the union meeting place to discuss and decide to put forward five demands to the capitalists as follows: (1) The 14 workers who were fired by each factory shall be reinstated. (2) Compensate each dismissed worker for the loss during the suspension of work. (3) Each injured worker's medical expenses shall be borne by the Yuyu factory. (4) Guarantee that workers will not be dismissed without reason in the future. (5) Conclude a labor-capital agreement, and elect Wang Xiuzhen, Zhou Shuiquan, Jin Xiumen, Xing Xiaolin, Ye Jingzhong, Jin Xiangmei, etc. as representatives of each factory. Yesterday morning, they continued to discuss the method of proceeding after the strike. In the afternoon, they originally planned to petition the municipal government, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the General Labor Union separately. However, because there were too many people, they were dissuaded by the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau Branch. The workers decided to elect representatives to petition again this morning, and separately visited Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Cai Shengbo, Chairman of the Silk Weaving Industry Association, to request assistance. The attitude of the workers is quite firm, and the capitalist side has also expressed their unwillingness to concede. The two sides are still at a stalemate.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Communications is Hosting the National Ship Registration and Promulgated Registration Rules Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications promulgated the Ship Industry Registration Rules yesterday to conduct national ship registration.

<h3>People from Sanhe Town, Anhui Donate Money to Support and Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>The Committee for Comforting the Anti-Bandit Soldiers in Sanhe Town, Anhui, stated in a letter, "Although the people of our town are located in a remote rural area, their patriotism is not behind anyone else. We have formed this committee and raised funds separately. Now we respectfully present all of the raised national currency of 859.82 yuan to be forwarded to the front line to comfort the soldiers defending against the invaders. This donation was obtained from the townships and towns, and it was not easy to enthusiastically contribute."</p>
<h3>Shantytown Association Requests Permission to Rebuild Destroyed Shantytowns</h3>
<p>The National Shantytown Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, yesterday we received your department's notice stipulating the scope of repair for shantytowns, that only the roof or walls of grass shacks can be repaired, and that it is not allowed to tear down the old grass shacks and rebuild them entirely. Our association has already forwarded this to all shantytowns to comply with. However, fire-stricken shantytowns have been accidentally burned down, which is unexpected. According to reason, they should be allowed to rebuild. Now, the fire-stricken shantytowns in the Chaoyang Road, Tengyue Road, Yangshupu Road, and Linqing Road areas in the Pudong district number no less than hundreds of families, all of whom are prevented from rebuilding due to your department's obstruction. At this time of cold weather, these people are displaced, and the situation is extremely miserable. In addition to repairing in accordance with the scope stipulated by your department, those who have suffered from fire should be allowed to build and recover in order to complete humanitarianism. We are extremely anxious and implore you to grant permission."</p>
<h3>The Tongyi United Creditors Group Continued to Meet Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Tongyi Trust Company's United Creditors Group held a meeting on the ninth floor of the YMCA at 4:00 PM yesterday. A total of more than 40 people, including representatives of the creditor group and lawyers, attended, with a total debt of more than 500,000. Lawyer Dong Yu was publicly elected as chairman. After reporting on the establishment of the United Creditors Group, the anti-appeal liquidation carried out in the initial stage, and the work of requesting the court to execute bankruptcy, because Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and Wang Xiaoxiang served as mediators, all creditors stood on the principle of public interest and expressed their approval. However, all previous creditor meetings have been adjourned due to insufficient numbers. It is hoped that the bank creditor meeting on the 13th can be actively participated in so that the supervisors can smoothly elect people. In addition, more than 100 letters from creditors in Beiping, Hangzhou, and Shanghai were received, expressing their support for the mediation and resumption of business. Finally, lawyers and creditors such as Chen Chaojun and Le Junwei spoke successively, and there were no objections to the resumption of business. However, the inability to produce supervisors is a major obstacle, and there should be considerable ways to promote it. After discussion, Dong Yu, Chen Chaojun, Zhao Zuwei, and other five people were elected as candidates for supervisors, and the candidates were provided to the General Assembly for election, and it was resolved that Lawyer Dong Yu would be invited to attend the General Assembly to report on the proceedings of today's meeting.</p>
<h3>People's Food Improvement Association Requests Reduction of Flour Prices</h3>

<h3>City General Labor Union Denies Participating in Asian Labor Conference</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that a previous news report from the Allied News Agency claimed that amidst the bleak Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, the Shanghai General Labor Union of the Chinese labor community would send representatives in April of next year to hold an Asian Labor Conference with the Japanese labor community to shake hands, etc. A reporter from the Dagong News Agency, in order to understand the truth, specifically visited Mr. Zhu Xuefan, the chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union yesterday. According to his reply, the Asian Labor Conference was initiated and convened by the Japanese labor community. This year, they sent a letter to the China branch of the International Labor Bureau, which forwarded it to our union, asking us to send representatives to participate in the second conference to be held in Tokyo in April of next year, and attached the union's constitution. After reviewing the articles, the aim was to avoid war, establish international peace, and resist imperialism and capitalism. After the union submitted it for discussion, everyone agreed that because of the rampant imperialism, China's industry and commerce were collapsing, the rural areas were bankrupt, unemployment was increasing frequently, and the workers' suffering was profound. Moreover, due to Japan's continuous aggression, the national crisis was imminent. Of course, we agreed with the union's proposal to maintain peace. However, what the Japanese government and people have shown in fact is the opposite. They believe that it is impossible to participate before Japan changes its aggressive policies. The union should send a letter to the Japanese Labor Union based on this point, stating its wishes, and hoping that the Japanese labor community will urge the military authorities to reflect. As for the Allied News Agency's telegram that the union has replied to participate and shake hands with the Japanese labor community, this is not true.</p>

<h3>Silk Factories Run Out of Raw Materials, Liyuan and Thirteen Other Factories Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>After the price of Chinese silk in the European and American markets fell, all 48 silk factories operating in Shanghai suspended operations one after another due to running out of raw materials. As of yesterday, the factories that suspended operations included Hengtai, Zhenxiang, Dingchang, Yicheng, Shaoxing, Hongtai, Fuchang No. 2, Yutai, Yufeng, Yuanxing, Yuanji, China, and Liyuan, totaling thirteen factories. Factories such as Dongxiang and Yufeng have already run out of raw materials and will suspend operations immediately. As for the remaining factories that are still operating, such as Jiyu, it is expected that they will also suspend operations before the end of January.</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the European and American silk markets have been fluctuating recently. In October, they rose sharply, and each dan of Shanghai white silk could be sold for around 900 yuan. By last month, due to speculators taking the opportunity to act, the overseas markets all saw a decline. Each dan of Shanghai white silk fell by about 40 to 50 yuan. At the beginning of this month, it fell again. Currently, in the overseas market, each dan of Shanghai white silk is only sold for about 750 yuan, a sharp drop of more than 100 yuan compared to October. Moreover, sales are very sluggish, and the markets in the United States and France are at a standstill. The previous export volume was 55,077 bales, while the last export volume was only 38,961 bales, a decrease of about two-tenths. Moreover, because the end of the year is approaching and various industries will be settling accounts, it is difficult to expect improvement for the time being.</p>
<p>Autumn Cocoons Fail to Yield Good Harvest</p>
<p>The current Jiangzhe autumn cocoon harvest has failed to yield a good harvest and is not enough for the silk factories to use. Therefore, factories have continued to suspend operations in recent days. However, because this year's spring cocoon harvest was abundant, most cocoon merchants purchased a lot. Because the European and American silk markets were showing signs of improvement between September and October, they were hoarding and unwilling to sell easily. According to a survey by the silk industry, there are still 10,000 to 20,000 dan of cocoons stored in Shanghai foreign firms. If factories purchase from them, their prices are high. Based on the current silk market, it is not possible to make a profit. Therefore, silk factories are willing to suspend operations rather than continue production. Currently, 33 factories in the city are still operating, half of which still have spring cocoon reserves, which are enough to last until the end of the lunar year. The other factories will all suspend operations within days. It is feared that Shanghai silk factories will not be able to operate in the spring of next year.</p>
<p>Improving Sericulture</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Provinces Sericulture Unification and Improvement Committee, because it was aware that few rural families raised silkworms last year, which was not enough for silk factories to reel, made every effort to promote the increase of rearing households in the spring of last year, and changed all native varieties to improved varieties. However, due to time constraints, some areas were not able to improve them, and because the mulberry leaves were not enough for the silkworms to eat, it was not possible to promote them universally. According to silk factory merchants, the authorities of Jiangzhe provinces, being aware that this year's silkworm cocoons are still not enough for reeling, are now working hard to promote them. For example, in Zhejiang Province, in counties such as Changxing, Wuxing, Wukang, Jiaxing, Haining, Haiyan, Yuqian, Fuyang, Xindeng, Shengxian, and Xinchang, they are guiding silkworm farmers to uniformly raise improved varieties next spring. In Jiangsu Province, places such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and Nanjing are also doing the same, and all miscellaneous varieties will be eliminated. Regarding mulberry trees, they have also guided rural farmers to actively cultivate them. Currently, in Jiangsu Province, only the Zhenjiang area has planted mulberry trees, which can yield about 40,000 dan of leaves. Moreover, they are utilizing both sides of the roads to uniformly cultivate them. Therefore, it is predicted that the silkworm cocoon harvest in the spring of next year will increase by three or four tenths compared to this year. It is now determined that there will be no more concerns about shortages.</p>

<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to Proceed with Rural Loans</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to revive the rural economy, ordered all banks to allocate one-fifth of their savings deposits for agricultural loans. In addition to forming the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, which is dedicated to this purpose, all banks have established agricultural loan programs and have achieved considerable success. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has also received this order and is actively planning to proceed. It is reported that the principles have been decided. Previously, people were sent to Changshu and other places to investigate, intending to establish agricultural warehouse mortgage loan offices. However, due to the lack of suitable housing, they have not been established immediately. It is now known that these can be established gradually around January next year.</p>
<h3>Outgoing Japanese Consul in Shanghai, Terasaki, Returned to His Country Last Night</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul in Shanghai, Terasaki, was transferred back to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Last night, he took his family on the Japanese mail ship Tatsuta Maru and set off to return to his country. Colleagues including Japanese Consul General Wakasugi and Japanese expatriates went to the ship to see him off. The ship was scheduled to leave Shanghai at 7:00 am this morning. His successor, Kazaki Ichiro, arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month to take up his post.</p>
<p>Since the previous Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Ishisha, was promoted to Ambassador to Siam, it was previously announced that the former Consul General in Guangzhou, Kawai Tatsuo, would succeed him. However, at that time, Kawai was suffering from typhoid fever and returned to his country for treatment. Temporarily, the position was concurrently held by Counselor Wakasugi of the embassy. It is now known that Kawai has recovered and is scheduled to take the Shanghai Maru from Kobe on the 18th to come to China to take up his new post, and will arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 20th. Wakasugi will relinquish his position as Consul General in Shanghai after Kawai arrives in Shanghai and will devote himself to his role as Embassy Counselor.</p>
<h3>Appeal of the Japanese Sailor Hideo Nakayama Case: Full Text of the Yang Ye Judgment (Continued)</h3>
<p>Regarding the appellants' grounds for appeal, totaling five points, except for the third point concerning the motive for the murder, the fourth point concerning the defendant's counter-evidence, and the fifth point concerning the true facts that can be inferred from the evidence in this case, which are all speculative and ideal words and lack concrete evidence to prove them, their first argument contains many criticisms of the evidence presented by the police. Among the important points, they state that the bullet entered Hideo Nakayama's head from the back and exited from the front, and should have landed in front of the sailor, not eight feet away behind him. This court examined the original trial's sketch map, where the location where Hideo Nakayama was shot (red dot) and the place where he fell are three large steps apart. The bullet landed in the middle of these two locations (green dot), with the bullet's landing point originally in front of the location where Hideo Nakayama was shot. Furthermore, according to the diagnosis in the report of Japanese military doctor Kogawa, when Hideo Nakayama was sent to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters after being injured, his body temperature was 36.5 degrees, his pulse was 90, and his respiration rate was 22, which were not different from those of a normal person. Therefore, it was possible for him to continue walking forward after being injured, which is self-evident. Considering that Hideo Nakayama was physically strong, it is normal for him to continue walking three steps forward before falling to the ground after suddenly being attacked. It is impossible to disregard the sketch map and insist on the theory that the bullet landed behind him, based solely on the location where he fell. Furthermore, the fact that a gun fired through an animal may not leave bloodstains, and that the bullet was fired from the gun presented in the case has been identified by experts from the Forensic Medical Research Institute and the Shanghai Municipal Council's Ordnance Department, which cannot be refuted by the appellants' empty words. Moreover, witness Zhang Chen testified that Zeng Yuan and Zheng Weimin used a pencil to draw the shape of a gun while smoking opium, and later Zeng Yuan introduced Zhang Chen to Zheng Weimin, who said that if you report to the Japanese military headquarters that Hideo Nakayama was shot by Ye Haisheng, Yang Wendao, and the Korean Jie Ke, you could get a reward of four thousand yuan. The original trial, after questioning Hui Yuan about this testimony, stated that it was completely accurate. Yang Jianzhong also admitted in the original trial that he knew Zheng Weimin, gave Yang Wendao's address to Zheng, and borrowed money from Zheng. The book with the gun shape drawn on it was fabricated by Zheng and Zeng, and Yang Jianzhong planted it. This is not without basis. However, Zhang Chen was originally on good terms with Zeng Yuan and Zheng Weilong and others, and they were jointly seeking the reward. Later, due to conflicts of interest, he voluntarily reported to the law office of Ge Zhaoji, who defended Yang Wendao, and Ye drafted the statement for him, making statements in court that benefited Yang Wendao. Whether his words are credible is questionable. Even if, as the appellants say, Zheng Weimin and others did collude to accuse someone, colluding to accuse others of crimes in order to obtain a reward is different from framing someone with false evidence. According to the testimony of Zhang Chen, it can only prove that Zheng Weimin and others had the suspicion of colluding to accuse someone, but it cannot prove how Zheng Weimin framed someone with false evidence. The original trial's failure to adopt the testimonies of Zhang Chen, Zheng Weimin, Zeng Yuan, and others cannot be said to be without merit. Furthermore, according to the Forensic Medical Research Institute's identification, the fingerprints and bloodstains left in the book are not similar to Yang Wendao's fingerprints. There are two small holes on the paper on the opposite side of the gun's safety mechanism, and the edges are curled up with rust and oil stains. It is clear that the book was rusted due to oil, and the deep marks and holes in the book were not easily formed without external pressure. It is undoubtedly clear that it was temporarily pressed. The cut marks inside the holes are still new, and the two curves in the lower left of the book and the short side close to the left in the upper left are sufficient to prove that the book was temporarily created and planted. What is even more unknown is that the fingerprints left in the book, due to the small number of lines, are mostly incomplete short lines. Therefore, it cannot be proven that Yang Wendao's fingerprints also have these lines, as explained by the Forensic Medical Research Institute in the inspection report No. 100. At most, it can only be said that it cannot prove that he has these fingerprints. How can this be taken as evidence beneficial to the appellant? Iron rust is formed by the gasification of iron in the air. The location where it is placed, the humidity of the air, and whether there is oil on the surface of the gun all affect the speed of gasification. The rust alone cannot determine the date of storage. The deep marks and holes in the book are because the weight of the gun is only 600 grams, and without external pressure (such as heavy books and other items pressed on the book) or the gun shaking inside the holes of the book, it would not be sufficient to form this kind of hole. The cut marks of the gun shape in the book are located in the middle of the book, which is not easily exposed to external light and dust, and it is difficult to determine the age of the marks. All of these were explained separately by the Forensic Medical Research Institute in the inspection report No. 99, which is on file. If the place where the gun is placed is dry and the surface is covered with oil, the gasification process can be slowed down. Since the gun has been tested for oil, which has a rust-proof effect, the appellant's claim that it caused rust, turning slowness into speed, clearly contradicts the meaning of the Forensic Medical Research Institute's identification. As for the holes in the book, they can also be caused by the gun shaking in the book and are not absolutely dependent on external pressure. How can the appellant take things out of context to use as material for attacking the original judgment? Turning to the second point of the appellant's argument, it is nothing more than that Ye Haisheng's confession and performance in the original trial were not free. This court examined the original trial records. Although Ye Haisheng's confession was not entirely consistent before and after, it was not the result of torture and was consistent with the facts, as mentioned earlier. When the judge appointed by the original trial took Ye Haisheng and witness Hu Xianghe to the site for on-site inspection, Ye Haisheng's performance on that day, as recorded in the on-site inspection record, did not involve coercion, threats, inducements, fraud, or other improper methods that would make his performance unfree. The appellant's defense lawyers also participated and acknowledged that the record was accurate, and signed it accordingly, without Ye Haisheng making any statements that his performance was not free. How can the appellant make this claim only after the appeal? Although Ye Haisheng's hands were cuffed during the on-site inspection, and he was escorted by Japanese police officers, this was merely a security measure and cannot be taken as evidence that he was not free. Furthermore, the distance between the place where Ye Haisheng demonstrated that he fired the gun and the place where Hideo Nakayama stood was five or six normal steps away, which does not match the five centimeters or so shooting distance based on the gunpowder smoke marks on Hideo Nakayama's wound, as determined by the Forensic Medical Research Institute. However, during the act of killing, his mind was disordered and he was in a state of panic. The distance from which he fired the gun was something he could not have paid attention to, so it is impossible to have a detailed memory of every inch. Therefore, the fact that there were slight discrepancies in the location where he demonstrated that he fired the gun cannot be used to completely negate the fact that he confessed to the crime. As for the testimony of witness Pan Qiaoying, who said that she saw a sailor and another person walking in the same direction, separated in the east, west, front, and back, which is not completely inconsistent with Ye Haisheng's statement that he followed behind. During the on-site inspection, the details of witness Hu Xianghe's statement that Ye Haisheng ran out from beside the pole and that the clothes of the person who ran away seemed to be those of a sailor were explained separately in the original trial's judgment, which held that the observations were mistaken. In addition, witnesses Zhu Senfu and Ji A'gen stated in the original trial that Yang Wendao of the Tongyi Association did not come often, only once or twice, and that they had not seen Haisheng and the Korean, which is inconsistent with Yang Wendao's statement that he went to the association every day to work, and with the statement of Hong Wenwei, who voluntarily surrendered to the court and testified that Yang Wendao was often at the association. Hong Wenwei stated that on the afternoon of November 9th of last year, from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM, he was at the association with Yang Wendao. After I returned home, my child told me that a Japanese sailor had been killed, and I told Yang Wendao the next day, which also differs from Yang Wendao's statement that he only knew about it from the newspaper three or four days after the incident. This testimony is even more worthless.</p>
<p>In conclusion, except for the part concerning Zhou Sherong, which has already been decided and is not subject to discussion, the original trial held that the appellants' murder of Japanese sailor Hideo Nakayama was sufficient to cause disputes between China and foreign countries, and considered that the harm caused by the crime was extremely serious. Ye Haisheng was the principal offender, and Yang Wendao was the one who initiated the idea and was in a commanding position. Their circumstances are all unforgivable. According to Article 28, Paragraph 1 of Article 271, Paragraph 1 of Article 37, and Paragraph 1, Items 1 and 2 of Article 38 of the Criminal Law, they were each sentenced to death and deprived of their civil rights for life. The pistol, six bullets, one bullet casing, one bullet, and the book "Practical Physics" containing the hidden gun were ordered to be confiscated. This is not inappropriate. The appellants' arguments in support of their appeal are difficult to recognize as reasonable. According to Article 360 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment should be as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3>Crackdown on Gambling Stall on Fa Da Ma Road: 34 People Arrested and Sentenced Yesterday</h3>
<p>Detectives from the French Concession police station, acting on a tip-off received around 10 p.m. the previous evening, raided a gambling den located on the second floor of 426 Fa Da Ma Road. The police first cordoned off the area and then entered the premises, arresting the owner, Wei Desheng, from Anhui (48 years old, residing at 4 Fuxing Lane, Xiesuyu Road), and thirty-four gamblers including Wang Guangbin, Zhou Zhenqing, Zhou Chunjin, Ma Jiawu, Wei Shuhui, Song Jiahe, Gong Guoliang, Gong Zongyan, Song Jiatou, Song Youren, Zhou Daowan, Wei Shengui, Wang Zemin, Wang Baowen, Zhou Caixiao, Li Youfu, Yu Jianghua, Wang Shouran, Shi Shengzong, Chen Aji, Wei Shuhai, Li Qihe, Ao Yunchi, Sun Xueshun, Li Binggui, Wei Shouting, Huang Taibang, Chen Yonggui, Li Tingbang, Gong Shixuan, Guo Shaozhen, Gong Zongkai, and others. Most of them were textile workers from Anhui. They also confiscated 13 yuan in banknotes, 13 jiao in fractional notes, 15 jiao in subsidiary coins, eleven double hao coins, 3,600 copper coins, a dice shaker, and a set of dice, all of which were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Zhang Minsheng conducted the preliminary hearing. Police Attorney Chen Ming presented the case, and charges were brought in accordance with the law. The arresting officers reported the circumstances of the arrest, and the evidence was presented to the court. After questioning each of the defendants, the court announced the conclusion of the hearing. The owner, Wei Desheng, was sentenced to imprisonment, while the remaining gamblers were fined, and the confiscated items were forfeited.</p>
<h3>Victim Encounters Robbers in Amusement Park: Stolen Check Cashed After Being Forced to Sign</h3>
<p>Qian Futang, a government official from Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, resides at No. 26, Lane 150, Shanhai Guan Road. On the morning of October 22nd of this year at 8:50 AM, three robbers from Anhui – Huang Qinghe, Tao Ziqing, and Shou Zihe – under the pretext of delivering gifts (crabs), tricked their way into the house. They barged into the room, brandishing pistols, and ordered everyone to remain silent. They forced Qian and his family into a corner and guarded them while ransacking the house for an hour. They stole jewelry and legal tender totaling 2,374 yuan. Not satisfied, the robbers knew Qian had money deposited in the Bao Yuan Qian Zhuang Bank on Tianjin Road, so they forced Qian to sign a check for 1,000 yuan on the spot. Tao Ziqing went to cash the check and returned to Qian's house. After that, they grabbed their loot and fled. Qian immediately reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station and requested an investigation. More than a month has passed, and the case remains unsolved. Unexpectedly, Qian and his wife were at the Dajin World amusement park on Avenue Saint Marie in the French Concession the other afternoon, when they suddenly saw Huang Qinghe, one of the robbers who had robbed their house. Huang also saw Qian and his wife and tried to escape, but Qian chased and caught him, turning him over to the Annamese police, who took him to the French police station. The French police notified the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detective Ma Zhongrong to take Huang Qinghe back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where police attorney Zhang Tianyin charged him with robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Code. He stated that the defendant confessed in the police station that he and two other fugitives, Tao Ziqing from Tongzhou and Mao Zihe (aka Lao Si) from Pudong, had robbed Qian's house. All the jewelry had been pawned at the Qiu Tianbao silver shop for 164 yuan, and the defendant had received 110 yuan. However, the defendant had previously been punished for robbery and served eight years, and the police were concerned that he might have committed other crimes within the concession, so they requested a postponement. Qian Futang submitted evidence of the robbery, and identified the defendant in court as being not only present at the scene but also the one who pretended to deliver gifts, seemingly the ringleader. Questioned by the court, the defendant admitted to the robbery. Judge Fu Lin ordered the case postponed for seven days for further questioning, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Zhu Hong Accused of Obscenity: Luring a Young Girl Under 14 to a Hotel for Sexual Assault</h3>
<p>Zhu Hong, 39 years old, a native of this county, residing at No. 31, Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, was formerly the deputy director of the entertainment department at the Daxin Amusement Park. A woman from Wuxi, Shan Shen, lives at No. 241 Tianjin Road and runs a porridge shop. She has a daughter named Shan Zhenbao, currently 14 years old, studying at Qianjiang Elementary School on Ningbo Road, No. 430 Lane. Because Shan Shen has extra rooms for rent, the Metropolitan Dance Hall dancer Fan Meihua resides there, and Zhu Hong and Fan are acquaintances. In the spring of this year, Zhu visited Fan and met Zhenbao through Fan's introduction. At that time, Zhu immediately stated that he wanted to introduce Zhenbao to Daxin Amusement Park as a female employee at the billiard table, with a monthly salary of 40 or 50 yuan, up to 60 yuan. On June 2nd, Zhu invited Zhenbao to the Metropolitan Dance Hall, and after the dance, he took Zhenbao to Room 412 of the Great Eastern Hotel, using sweet words to deceive her, saying that he wanted to marry her and would give her mother several thousand yuan to buy a dowry, but she refused, saying that the matter of marriage must be approved by her mother, so there was no result. A month later, on July 7th, Shan received an invitation card from Zhu, inviting her to dinner at the Golden Dragon Restaurant. She did not suspect anything and went. However, that night, Zhu lured her to Room 308 of the Great China Hotel and forced her to have sexual intercourse. However, after achieving his goal, Zhu disappeared and never went to her place again. The girl's mother entrusted attorney Yu Xiangqin to send a letter to Zhu Hong to negotiate, but Zhu replied completely denying it. The woman reported it to the Laozha Police Station on the afternoon of the first of this month at 5:30 PM. Chinese detective Ye Yusi and Western detective No. 84 went to Zhu's house to investigate. Zhu actually believed that the detectives were impersonating police officers and illegally entered and searched, so he hired attorney Dai Ji'en to file a lawsuit against Shan Zhenbao in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court for obstructing freedom, requesting that she be punished according to Articles 306 and 307 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened the Fifth Criminal Court for interrogation. Shan also hired attorney Yu Xiangqin to appear in court, and in addition to stating the circumstances of being sexually assaulted by Zhu, she also filed a counter-suit for obstructing public morals. Because Shan's birthday is the sixth day of the first lunar month, she is not yet 14 years old, so she requested that he be punished according to Paragraph 2 of Article 221 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Pan verified the confession, he ordered the case to be adjourned for investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ye Fukun Case to Continue Today</h3>
<p>Ye Fukun, a former judge of the Shanghai Local Court, who was dismissed for misapplying the law in sentencing, and is now practicing law, was accused by Wang Hanqing, a former detective in Hankou, to the Ministry of Justice, claiming that in 1931, he was implicated in a theft case in the Public Concession, and hired Ye to defend him, but Ye embezzled 18,000 yuan. The Ministry of Justice sent it to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor to investigate once, ordered Ye to pay 20,000 yuan in cash bail, and filed a public prosecution for the details of the trial, which were recorded in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month. It is known that this case is scheduled to continue the interrogation in the fourth court of the Local Court at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Iron Factory Foreman Accused of Enticement and Interrogation</h3>
<p>Yang Zizhen, a native of Nanjing, residing on Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, formerly a foreman in a certain iron factory, was recently sued by Teng Kaotang, a native of Yancheng, to the Criminal Court of the Local Court for enticing and hiding his daughter Jin Gui. Yesterday morning, Judge Shao Qinzhi opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Teng Kaotang, stated: My daughter Jin Gui is currently 20 years old, not yet the legal age. In April of last year, she was enticed by the defendant Yang Zizhen. On September 23rd of this year, she was again coaxed into a sexual encounter, which was discovered by the plaintiff. Yang then instigated my daughter to sever her relationship with me, and even hired attorney Wu Kaisheng to publish a statement in the newspaper stating, "Unless the old-fashioned marriage is dissolved, she will never return home." Therefore, I am suing according to law to investigate and punish him. The defendant Yang Zizhen stated: I have a wife and children. Because the plaintiff has long had a feud with me, he is taking advantage of his daughter's escape, making false accusations, and I ask the court to investigate. Furthermore, according to Teng Gui Jin, 21 years old, born on September 19th, when I was six years old, my father betrothed me to someone. I am now grown up and oppose blind, old-fashioned marriages. My father insisted on sending me to the countryside to complete the marriage. I did not want to, so I ran away on my own, and I implore attorney Wu for legal assistance. The judge asked, Do you have a relationship with Yang? She answered, No. The judge asked, Do you have a relationship with anyone else? She answered, No. At this point, the judge asked Yang Zizhen, According to you and Teng Jin Gui, you both deny it, then this court can conduct an examination. Before Yang could answer, Teng Jin Gui quickly said, I am still a virgin. Thereupon, the judge ordered that Jin Gui be sent to a female forensic doctor for examination, and immediately began the debate, declaring the debate closed, and waiting for the expert report to be submitted before giving a verdict. The defendant Yang Qian Zhen still paid a deposit of 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Sudden Death of an Elderly Woman</h3>
<p>Cao Zhang, a 76-year-old widow, a resident of Xu Village, the third Bao of Beishou Yuepu Township, Wusong, had some savings in her hands. The elderly woman went to bed the previous evening, and had not gotten up by noon the next day. Neighbors went to check on her and saw a hole dug in the wall outside the woman's room, initially suspecting it was the work of thieves. But after entering, they suddenly saw the elderly woman lying stiff on the bed, and she was already dead. They sent someone to Wusong to notify her husband's younger brother, Cao Meisheng. Because the death of the elderly woman was highly suspicious and she might have been murdered, they reported it to the Baoshan County Government and requested an autopsy to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices of Hardware</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, because the foreign prices of various hardware and steel products have been gradually rising recently, convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees the other day. More than ten people, including Chairman Zhang Lianfang and Supervisor Zhao Xianji, attended. Chairman Zhang Lianfang, after the usual formalities, began to discuss prices. Everyone felt that the purchase price had soared and was far from the current retail price. All steel pipes and all hardware items had been raised by 30% to 40%. It was found that the stock in Shanghai was scarce, the source was insufficient, and there was a trend that supply could not meet demand. Therefore, people's hearts were upward, and there was a trend of continued soaring prices.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Crushes Teenager to Death, Severing Him in Two: Appears to Be Suicide</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo train arriving in Shanghai had reached the platform of the South Station, when unexpectedly a teenager rushed into the tracks, resulting in the train crushing him at the waist, severing him into two pieces. It was found that the deceased was in his twenties, wearing a wool sweater, lined with a small padded jacket, and blue cloth pants tucked at the ankles, with a fair complexion, appearing to be a man of the period. The shape clearly indicated suicide. Because the train had already entered the station, its speed was very slow, making it easy to avoid. The Mountain Police Department ordered an investigation and found no family members, so today they ordered the local Bao Gu Xueyuan to report to the Local Court for an autopsy. Inspector Wang was usually assigned, with staff inspectors. They checked the scene and determined the cause, and the body was placed in the mortuary, awaiting family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>Fugitive Apprehended</h3>
<p>The Dongjiadu Police Station, the previous month, had extradited two notorious thieves nicknamed "Flying Legs" and "Annam Monkey" to the General Bureau for legal proceedings. On the way, the two thieves managed to remove their handcuffs and escape, causing great concern. The General Bureau had strictly ordered a thorough search. Until the other night, the Sixteenth Pu Detective Squad, after guarding and arresting all night, finally captured the two escaped criminals. Yesterday, they were taken to the General Bureau for strict interrogation.</p>
<h3>X-ray Tuberculosis Prevention Checkup: Statistics for Last Month's Checkup: 24 Percent Healthy</h3>
<p>The third-month checkup report for the tuberculosis prevention X-ray checkup initiated by the Chinese Tuberculosis Prevention Association Medical Committee and the Hongqiao Sanatorium is as follows: The total number of checkups was 419, including 270 men and 149 women. By occupation, there were 147 in the business world, 168 in the academic world, 10 in the education world, 15 in the industrial world, 18 civil servants, and 61 unemployed. The results of the checkup were: 101 people were completely healthy, accounting for 24 percent of the total; 52 people had active pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 12.3 percent of the total; 250 people had inactive pulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 59.6 percent of the total; and 16 people had heart or aortic changes, accounting for 3.7 percent of the total. It is noteworthy that, according to statistics from previous sessions of the examination of citizens who were examined, the presence of pulmonary tuberculosis changes were all above 50 percent. Therefore, this active preventive method of early diagnosis should be deeply noted by all urban residents for preventing problems before they occur. Currently, the examination method can still purchase certificates from Shenbao first, and the location is No. A2, Daxi Road.</p>
<h3>First Physician Screening Officially Announced</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Health Department, in order to assist Western-style doctors in various regions who did not register during the period of temporary certification for physicians, has specially formulated physician screening methods for processing. It officially announced the commencement on December 1st. The Shanghai Health Bureau, fearing that these Western-style doctors are not fully aware, has copied the original public announcement and widely announced it to ensure compliance.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Numismatic Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Numismatic Society held its tenth research meeting the other day, with more than 20 members attending. The research topic was "Song Coins," and the questions were quite detailed. In addition, the third issue of the society's journal, "Gu Quan Xue," has also been published, with extremely rich content. In addition to the unengraved draft of "Gu Quan Hui Kao" (Collected Studies of Ancient Coins), Weng Yiquan's "Xin Mang Shi Bu" (Ten Cloth Coins of Wang Mang), is recognized as a rare masterpiece. Other works, such as Zhang Jiongbo's "He Wei Quan Huo Xue" (What is Numismatics), Zheng Jiaxiang's "Liao Qian Kao" (Study of Liao Coins), Gan Wuquan's "Wu Qian Da Quan Ji" (Record of Five Thousand Large Coins), Ding Fubao's "Gu Quan Xue Da Wang" (Outline of Numismatics), Wu Chengluo's "Dui Yu Yan Jiu Gu Quan Yu Quan Du Guan Xi Zhi Xi Wang" (Hopes for the Study of the Relationship between Ancient Coins and Weights and Measures), and Dai Baoting's "Gu Quan Cong Tan" (Miscellaneous Talks on Ancient Coins), are all systematic and valuable works. It is also heard that they are still sold by the Medical Bookstore, Shanghai Magazine Company, and the Author's Bookstore.</p>
<h3>Recent Conditions in Wusong City: Business Sluggish, Not Recovered to Pre-War State; Pig Industry's Move to Shanghai May Affect Wusong</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, Wusong, with its wide and orderly streets and novel and beautiful buildings, does appear more aesthetically pleasing and magnificent upon superficial observation than before. However, the market's desolation and the sluggishness of business have not recovered to their pre-war state. The reason for this is that Wusong is located at the mouth of the sea, and in the past, cargo ships shuttled in and out like weaving, making it a hub for shipping merchants, hence the old name "Water Wharf." Since the National Government implemented the system of cutting transit duties and increasing taxes, tax collection agencies such as customs and tax bureaus have all been abolished. Merchants passing through no longer need to stop. In addition, the relocation of army, navy, and police forces to other locations has caused the market to plummet. Currently, what sustains it are the emerging pig industry in the east town, the Wing On and Hua Feng spinning mills, and the Zhanghuabang Railway General Machinery Factory in the west town. Therefore, various businesses can still manage to maintain operations. However, recently there have been two events that could significantly affect the prosperity and decline of Wusong City. The first is the relocation of the Railway General Machinery Factory. The factory has received an order from the Railway Bureau, for the sake of facilitating railway engineering, to move the entire factory to near Qishuyan outside the South Gate of Changzhou. They have already begun to gradually relocate, and it is said that the relocation will be completed within one or two years. Once the relocation is completed, all departments of the factory, including staff, artisans, railway police, laborers, and servants, along with their families, will inevitably leave with the factory. This will reduce the population of Wusong City. The second is the proposed relocation of the pig industry back to South Shanghai. The Shanghai and Wusong factions are secretly brewing this intensely. Since the January 28th Incident, the municipal government stipulated that Yizhoutang in Wusong should be the area for fresh pig stockades. Shanghai pig businesses have flocked to Wusong to set up branches, and pig sties have been built with basic facilities. Therefore, in the past two years, in addition to the original three pig businesses, the number has expanded to about twenty. The staff, stockade managers, lightermen, carters, and pig merchants of each business have added more than several hundred households to the residents of Wusong. Recently, Shanghai businesses, considering the inconvenience of doing business and the enormous expenses, have jointly submitted a petition to the municipal government, requesting permission to relocate back to the vicinity of Gaochang Temple in South Shanghai for business, calling it "centralization," which has aroused opposition from Wusong businesses. However, Wusong only has four businesses: Wan Shen, Jia Tai, Yuan Tai, Hong Da, etc., and their strength is far inferior to that of Shanghai businesses. However, Wusong businesses have a formal reason for opposition, saying that the stipulation of the pig sty area was based on the order of the municipal government and has not been implemented for long. However, the pig industry's business is all within the scope of the urban area, and they should comply with the municipal government's order. Therefore, the weighing of this matter rests with the municipal government. Whether it can revoke the previous order remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Labor Service Propaganda Held in Gaoqiao Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM yesterday, the city's Labor Service Committee convened a discussion meeting in Rixin Elementary School, Gaoqiao Town, to discuss matters related to labor service propaganda in the area. More than eighty people attended, including Tang Jinghuan, director of the area; Su Shude of Gaoqiao Elementary School; Xu Guangxie of the Gaoqiao District Farmers' Association; Wang Kuisheng of the Rural Improvement Association; Shen Guanlin, the local guarantor; and local gentry Zhao Shirong and Yin Yuyang. First, Chairman Tang Jinghuan reported that the Gaoqiao District's labor service for this year has decided to dredge waterways such as the Huangtong Port and construct seawalls, hoping that all sectors will work hard to promote and ensure that the public understands the meaning of civic labor service. Yu Zhenhui, a representative of the Labor Service Committee, was then asked to instruct on the propaganda guidelines, and then the discussion began, and the following propaganda methods were decided: (1) Propaganda week will be held starting next week; (2) Make use of the opportunity to investigate school-age children to publicize as much as possible; (3) Compile propaganda phrases and have storytellers in teahouses publicize them; (4) Regularly hold costume speeches, with the Rural Improvement Association, the Security Corps, the Public Security Bureau, the District Farmers' Association, and all public and private schools in the district responsible for organizing them. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Commemorate Wu Shan</h3>
<p>It has been more than two months since the passing of former Judicial President Wu Shan. Yesterday, his old friends initiated a memorial service to express their condolences. They have already held a preparatory meeting. Yesterday, preparatory committee members Ji Zhenwang, Wu Kaisheng, Lou Zhaonian, Xue Dubi, and Li Zushen held a meeting at the Gongdelin Temple and resolved the following: (1) The memorial service will be rescheduled to 2:00 PM on January 16th at the Hu She Society; (2) Jiang Rong, Sheng was appointed as accountant, and other documents and general affairs will be handled by the Roads Association staff; (3) Each committee member will advance 30 yuan for the required expenses; (4) A notice will be placed in the newspaper requesting that anyone sending gifts should send cash instead to be used as the Wu Shan family's children’s education fund to avoid extravagance. It is reported that the preparatory committee is located in the Gubalu Roads Association.</p>

<h3>Taiping Mountain Outside Wusong Establishes Calcium Carbide Lamp; Privately Installed Lights Have Been Taken Over; Because It Is a Key Navigation Route for Numerous Sailing Vessels</h3>
<p>Taiping Mountain, belonging to Zhejiang province outside Wusong, is also one of the Zhoushan Islands. Fishing boats and other sailing vessels travel to and fro throughout the year, forming a continuous stream. Therefore, the residents of the island raised funds to privately install a fixed oil lamp to facilitate ship navigation. The Jianghai Customs, recognizing that the light is crucial for navigation, has officially taken over the lamp and installed a new white tower (280 feet above high tide) with an unattended calcium carbide flashing light. The light has a range of 10 nautical miles and was lit on the 18th of this month. The lamp is located at 121 degrees 19 minutes 9 seconds east longitude and 30 degrees 5 minutes north latitude, near the northwest corner of Taiping Mountain.</p>
<h3>Kuaili Breaks Anchor Chain</h3>
<p>The Kuaili, a state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company vessel, originally sailed the middle reaches of the Yangtze River from Hankou to Shashi and Yichang. Recently, due to the shallowing of the Yangtze River (yesterday, the draft limit between Hankou and Xunyang was 10 feet), making it difficult for large ships to navigate, the Kuaili was telegraphed to Shanghai to operate a direct service to Yisha. On this voyage, when the ship arrived near Liuhaisha's Pitmankin Light Vessel at night, three large junks suddenly appeared, without lights, attempting to cross the bow of the Kuaili. At the time, the northwest wind was very strong, and they were approaching aggressively. The Kuaili was fully loaded with cargo and passengers. If it continued forward, it would inevitably collide, causing a major accident. If it tried to avoid the collision by veering to the side, it would run aground in the shallow sand. Captain Gu Shurong quickly reversed the engines and dropped both anchors to avoid the collision. The three junks safely passed, and the Kuaili was fortunate not to run aground. However, when the two anchors were dropped, one anchor lost its balance due to a short chain (four sections), and the anchor chain snapped. One large iron anchor sank to the bottom of the river. After inspection, it was found that 5,948 feet of anchor chain was lost, and the anchor that sank weighed 2,240 pounds, totaling a loss of several thousand yuan. Now that the ship has arrived in Shanghai, the head office has been notified, and a new chain and anchor must be installed.</p>
<h3>Two Workers Seriously Injured in Truck Fall</h3>
<p>Yun Chang Coal Depot at No. 21 Fengji Wharf Street in Nanshi specializes in coal for tiger stoves, so business is booming. It has two trucks for transporting goods, and every morning it loads fuel and distributes it to various users. At around 7:00 AM yesterday, the No. 2 truck, loaded with coal, was traveling on Lujiabang Road when, due to excessive speed, the large sacks of coal piled on the truck suddenly collapsed, and two laborers standing on the truck fell at the same time, both suffering serious injuries. The police arrived and impounded the vehicle that caused the accident. They immediately called an ambulance to take the two injured laborers to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. One, Zhang Zhiming, 25 years old, from Suqian, suffered a fractured skull and brain injury. He died shortly after due to excessive bleeding. The other, Jia Zhenfei, 27 years old, from Suqian, suffered injuries to his head, face, waist, and other parts of his body and was unconscious. It is said that his life is also in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Concession Tax Collectors Should Pay Attention to Regulations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We respectfully inform you that, according to a letter from the Dazhonglou Restaurant, a taxpayer, 'Our restaurant, located at No. 706 at the intersection of Edward Road and Yunnan Road, has been in business for ten years. The quarterly liquor tax has always been 21 yuan, and the food tax has been 10 yuan. This winter, the food tax was suddenly changed to 30 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan per quarter compared to before. When we inquired about the reason for the increase, the tax collector refused to explain. Subsequently, every time they came to collect, they were accompanied by police officers, and their language was often coercive. Paying taxes is the duty of citizens. Even if the economy is extremely difficult, we try our best to raise the money and have never asked for a slight reduction. Now, the tax is suddenly increased several times. What is the reason? It is incomprehensible. If it is based on seating capacity, all three floors were used for our own use when the restaurant was first established. After 1930, we began to rent out the ground floor due to sluggish business. To this day, the ground floor has not been reclaimed, and the seating capacity on the second and third floors remains the same as in 1930 and has not been increased or expanded. If it is based on the state of the market, the business situation is even worse compared to 1930, and there is no need for our restaurant to provide evidence. We believe that your department has felt the pain of the worsening situation over the years. However, at this time of economic difficulties, it is truly perplexing to suddenly double the tax. We have reported the details of what happened and request that you forward this to the department and cancel the extra ten yuan of food tax per quarter. After all, the economic policy of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs is not a way to develop financial resources. Your association is the voice of taxpayers. Please advocate for fairness.' Upon receiving the letter, we found that there are specific regulations for the collection of various taxes, which taxpayers use as a basis, and tax collectors should follow. However, your department's tax collectors not only do not collect taxes according to the tax regulations, but they also increase or decrease taxes at will. Although there are specific regulations, they are equivalent to waste paper. Such actions are bound to cause trouble, causing taxpayers to dispute frequently over tax payments. According to the above, we request that your department promptly instruct the relevant department to strictly warn the tax collectors to pay attention to the tax regulations, understand the social economy, and not cause disturbances, so as to ensure commercial stability."</p>
<h3>Third Branch of the Higher Court Rents Vacant Land from the French Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Yang Peng, the president of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, since taking office, has observed that the buildings of the Third Branch and the Second Special District Court, apart from the courtrooms being self-owned property, the offices of both courts are rented from private houses. From August 1931 to the present, the annual rental cost is not small. Because there is a piece of vacant land adjacent to the east of the courtrooms of the two courts, which belongs to the French Municipal Council, he planned to request funds from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to rent the vacant land of the French Municipal Council to build a new building. The drawings have been completed, the cost of labor and materials has been estimated at 180,000 yuan, and a report has been submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval. It has been reported in the newspapers. Now, it is known that the president of the Special District Court and the French Municipal Council are negotiating to sign a lease agreement, with the lease term set at 50 years and the rent set at one yuan per year. Negotiations are underway, and once an agreement is reached, a lease will be signed. It is expected to be successful early next year and construction will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>A Rōnin Who Extorted Money Is Sentenced</h3>
<p>Zhang Baosheng, a Liyang native who works as a meal contractor, and his friend and fellow villager, Zhang Genfa, were walking along Yangshupu Road at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, planning to go somewhere for recreation. They were stopped by Jiang Guohe, a Hubei rōnin, who demanded money for no reason and dragged them into the Gonghe Teahouse at No. 1381 on the same road. Seven accomplices surrounded and beat them. Xie Huakang, a Jiangbei native who worked at the teahouse, mediated and asked Zhang Baosheng to give five yuan to ensure that there would be no further trouble. Zhang Genfa paid five yuan, and they were allowed to leave. Zhang Baosheng was unwilling to accept this and reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station. Detective Pang Hao Shan was dispatched to arrest Jiang and Xie and take them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, presented the case and requested prosecution. Zhang Baosheng and Zhang Genfa testified about what happened. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Xie Fen sentenced Jiang Guohe and Xie Huakang to three months imprisonment each as a warning.</p>

<h3>Rats' Sandbar: Cancellation of Gunpowder Depot Construction; Trilateral Announcement by Three Bureaus</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs originally planned to acquire land on the Rats' Sandbar to build a gunpowder depot. The decision has been canceled, and it is now planned to build a floating gunpowder depot outside Wusongkou. Separate letters have been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government, ordering the three bureau chiefs of the Public Security Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and Land Bureau to issue a joint announcement. The original announcement is copied below: The announcement was issued by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and Land Bureau, No. 28023. The announcement stated: "The Jianghai Customs has submitted separate letters stating that the area west of the Guanghua Petroleum Depot on Rats' Sandbar in Gaoqiao District has been designated as a dangerous area for the construction of a gunpowder depot. The measures for the disposal of land and buildings within the dangerous area were drawn up and announced by this bureau and others in December 1934. This case has been instructed by the Shanghai Municipal Government No. 21259, with the approval of a letter from the Inspector General of Customs, stating: 'The original plan to build a gunpowder depot on Rats' Sandbar has now been changed to build a floating gunpowder depot outside Wusongkou. Please order the bureau to cancel the original case and announce it to the residents of the area.' In addition to canceling the original case, a joint announcement is hereby issued, ordering the residents of the area to be fully informed. Public Security Bureau Chief Cai Jingjun, Public Works Bureau Chief Shen Yi, Land Bureau Chief Xu Fu.</p>
<h3>South Shanghai Fire Brigade Sues Tenant for Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>The South Shanghai Fire Brigade Union in this city owns the property at No. 30, Yongqing Lane, Liufen Lane, Liufen Branch Lane. It was originally leased to Guo Zhouji for a long time. Guo Zhouji secretly transferred it to Gu Xuepu, also known as Gu Bosheng, but without notifying the union or entering into a new lease. From March to November of this year, he has accumulated nine months of rent arrears and has ignored the matter. Because this property is used for the expenses of maintaining public welfare undertakings, and Gu has not found a guarantor, Ye Peilin, who manages the union's rental properties, reported to the police station in accordance with Articles 2 and 13 of the Shanghai Municipal Housing Leasing Regulations issued by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and ordered Gu Zhaosuo to be summoned. Because he did not find a guarantor, he was sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention. It is said that the regulations allow for a detention of ten days. Gu's wife then filed a complaint with the local court against Ye for obstructing freedom. Yesterday, under questioning by Prosecutor Deng, he told Gu's wife to ask the Public Security Bureau to review the case again.</p>
<h3>After the Death of Gu Rongfen, a British Missionary Stationed in Guizhou, the Guizhou Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission Will Erect a Monument in His Memory for His Contributions</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Rongfen, a British national, had been teaching in Guizhou for more than 40 years and was very enthusiastic about charitable work. In 1920, the Guizhou Branch of the China International Famine Relief Commission was established, and he was appointed as an honorary treasurer. Mr. Gu readily accepted the position and was very responsible for the safekeeping of funds. When Tang Jiyao was in charge of Guizhou, the Commission remitted 160,000 yuan to Guizhou, which was demanded by the guest army. Mr. Gu negotiated back and forth, exhausting himself, and finally managed to have the entire amount returned to avoid embezzlement. The Guizhou Branch has been able to maintain its operations until today, thanks to this money. Mr. Gu passed away due to illness a month ago, at the age of 68. The Branch, in recognition of his contributions to famine relief in Guizhou Province, Mr. Ren Zhiqing specifically proposed to build a memorial monument for him to commend his special service and encourage others. The entire Branch has passed the proposal, and a design has been drafted. Construction will begin soon in the courtyard of the Branch in Yanjiaxuan, Guiyang.</p>
<h3>Principal Hu of Wuben Talks About the Case of Dismissed Teachers</h3>
<p>According to Shanghai She, Principal Hu of the Municipal Wuben Girls' High School said that some of the reports in the newspapers about the case of the dismissed teachers are inconsistent with the facts. For example, "The plaintiffs stated that they were hired by the defendant as teachers of the school." Peng Junshi, De Jingwa, Yan Yuxin, Wan Rong, etc., were all teachers hired during the tenure of the previous principal, Yan Zhenyu, and were not teachers hired during his tenure. This is inconsistent with the facts. Secondly, "There was a contract, and the defendant suddenly terminated it in the autumn of this year without providing a reason." Peng Junshi, De Jingwa, Yan Yuxin, etc., did not meet with the principal. There was neither oral nor written inquiry. Only Wan Rong met with the principal, and he often told her that she had not been rehired. Wan did not ask any questions. This is the second fact that is inconsistent. The third fact that is inconsistent is that "the school's secretary, Mr. Hu, was entrusted to represent the school in court." There is no one with the surname Hu in the school's secretary. The agent entrusted by the principal was lawyer Wei Weiqing. On the day of the hearing, lawyer Wei went to Suzhou for another case and entrusted lawyer Zhang Zhu to attend the court. Mr. Hu went on to say that his administration and employment were always fair and just. None of the hired teachers were hired privately. All of them had considerable qualifications and abilities and had been approved by the Bureau of Education. The non-renewal of employment for Peng Junshi, etc., was also approved by the Bureau of Education and was a legal act. These were Mr. Hu's words. As to who is right and who is wrong, now that it has been referred to law, there shall be a proper resolution. In addition, it was reported that the small number of teachers who were not rehired had reported to the Municipal Bureau of Education that the defendant was abusing his authority. It has now been ascertained that the former Municipal Bureau of Education and the current Bureau of Social Affairs have not received this document.</p>
<h3>Pimping Out Daughter Prosecuted as Obstructing Morality; Daughter Does Not Wish to Sue; Court Rules Self-Prosecution Not Accepted</h3>
<p>Tian Yang, a woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 2455 Fangbang Road in the Chinese area, is 40 years old. She had previously prostituted her daughter, Su Zhen, 15 years old, at No. 2 Yinyuli, Baxianqiao in the French Concession, at the brothel opened by Wang Xiqin (also known as Wang Linji) and his wife, Yao, together. Su Zhen is now 19 years old. Recently, Tian Yang, in her capacity as legal guardian, filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, Criminal Division, in the name of her daughter, Tian Su Zhen, accusing Wang Xiqin of obstructing morality. According to the indictment, in the past, she used the excuse of recommending her daughter Su Zhen to work as a maid, luring her into prostitution, and requested a trial. The court accepted the indictment. Yesterday, Judge Chen Gongying of the Second Criminal Division summoned Tian Yang and her daughter Tian Su Zhen to the court for questioning. The defendant did not arrive. According to Su Zhen's testimony, she is 19 years old, from Nanjing, and currently resides at No. 2 Yinyuli. Yang is her mother, but she has many fathers, and she doesn't know if she is Yang's biological child. She was brought to Shanghai by Yang when she was 12 years old and was first sold for 40 yuan to work in a yarn factory for two years. Because it was difficult, she was redeemed and told to work for a company. She was deflowered when she was 15 years old and sent by her mother to work at Zai Linji's brothel. She (referring to Yang) had decided to sue the Zai Linji's owner. She does not know anything about it. She does not want to sue and wants to earn money and support her mother. Tian Yang testified that Su Zhen is her biological daughter. She does not want her to be a prostitute and wants to bring her back and find her a husband. Su Zhen then claimed that her mother sent her to be a prostitute and had written evidence. The mother signed it and took out three pledge tickets issued by Yang to the brothel owner and presented them to the court, saying that the pledge papers were not brought today. After verifying the testimonies, the court informed Tian Yang that criminal self-accusations must be made by the injured party in person, and no one else can file on their behalf. Moreover, according to Su Zhen's testimony, she does not want to sue, so the case is not established. Therefore, the court ruled that the self-accusation was not accepted. Tian Yang was dissatisfied with the verdict and left in a huff.</p>
<h3>Tao Jingming and His Mistress Engage in Public Disputes and Legal Proceedings</h3>
<p>Tao Jingming, 30 years old, from Pinghu, has been an employee of the Commercial Press. Three years ago, he and Wang Yueying (20 years old) began cohabitating due to their relationship. Unexpectedly, their love recently fell apart, and Wang Yueying often did not return home, each going to extremes. Yueying first published a statement attacking Tao for seducing women from good families, and Tao also published a notice in the News Daily on October 27 of this year announcing the termination of cohabitation with Wang Yueying, stating that Wang Yueying was born into prostitution and had an inherently promiscuous nature. The two sides engaged in a war of words, tit for tat, causing Wang Yueying to lose face. She then filed a lawsuit in the local court accusing Tao Jingming of defamation, obstructing freedom, and abandonment. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang ordered Tao to be released on bail after interrogation. Now the investigation has been completed, and a public prosecution has been filed, stating that anyone who can prove that the matter defamed is true shall not be punished, but this does not apply to matters involving private morality and unrelated to public interest. Article 310 of the Criminal Law has clear provisions. Whether Wang Yueying was born into prostitution or not involves private morality and cannot be publicly pointed out in the newspaper. As evidenced by the notice published in the News Daily, the defendant cannot escape the responsibility under Article 310, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. As for Wang Yueying and Tao Jingming cohabiting for many years, it is difficult to consider it as obstructing freedom. Since they were cohabiting, there is no abandonment to be discussed and should be dismissed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Bojun interrogated Tao Jingming, who testified that he published the notice to protect his own interests because Wang Yueying first published a statement on October 23 stating that he was seducing women from good families. If he did not publish the notice, he would have acquiesced. He only cohabited with her for three years and did not marry, etc. Prosecutor Lei then presented his opinion, stating that even if Wang Yueying was a prostitute, it should not have been published in the newspapers. He requested that he be dealt with according to the law. The defendant hired lawyer Li Pengcheng for arguments and the judge adjourned the discussion and would pronounce the verdict on the 15th of this month. The defendant paid the original bail.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Districts Repeatedly Bust Opium Dens, Totaling More Than Seventy Cases</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that after active efforts by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in banning opium and drugs, the number of opium dens in the city has gradually decreased. From the 1st to the 10th of this month, more than seventy cases of unlicensed private opium shops have been busted by various districts. After interrogation by the Public Security Bureau, they were transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for punishment according to the law. Dai Lizhen, the chief of the 4th section of the bureau, was deeply concerned that his subordinates would neglect the ban or engage in private malfeasance, so he personally went to various districts every day to conduct strict supervision and also warned his staff to work hard on the opium ban. The deadline for the third phase of license renewal has been extended to the end of this month. Those who fail to renew their licenses before the deadline will have their original old licenses revoked and will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Longwen Bookstore Reopened</h3>
<p>Xu Wancheng, the owner of the Longwen Bookstore in Dounan, was previously detained by the former president of the local court, Luo Tong, and others for commenting on the local court, resulting in huge losses. He is now suing and requesting legal action. His wife, Madam Zhu Airu, recently passed away. She was again implicated by having guaranteed someone and a series of misfortunes have befallen her. Recently, the Longwen Bookstore she set up was sealed due to rent arrears. Fortunately, many of her friends, Huang Yun, Wang Kui, Luo Yiwen, and others, helped. The rent arrears case has now been resolved, and the local court dispatched personnel yesterday (the 11th) to remove the seal. Mr. Xu told people that no matter how harsh the environment is, he must fight to the end. Longwen will continue to work tirelessly to promote education, culture and other investigative tasks.</p>

<h3>Guangling Tide Copyright Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The late renowned novelist Li Hanqiu's legacy, the novel "Guangling Tide," was recently adapted into a film screenplay by Yi Hua Film Company. The film, released on the silver screen, retained the original novel's title, also naming its drama "Guangling Tide," and published advertisements for publicity. However, Zhu Rongfang, the owner of Zhenya Bookstore, which published the novel, claimed that the copyright of "Guangling Tide" had long been owned by the bookstore. Yi Hua's use of the book as the basis for its screenplay, and the identical drama title, constituted an infringement. Therefore, he engaged a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Yan Chuntang of Yi Hua in the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering the defendant not to use the name "Guangling Tide" as a film drama title. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji presided over the hearing. The plaintiff's attorney stated the intent of the lawsuit and presented the defendant's published advertisements as evidence. The defendant's lawyer argued that adapting a novel into a film involved a different technical process, and according to legal precedents, did not constitute infringement, and did not require the plaintiff's prior consent. After both sides concluded their arguments, Judge Xu announced that the verdict would be pronounced on the afternoon of the sixteenth of this month.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have recently read the news item on page 17 of your newspaper on the 10th of this month, titled "Chinese Match Factory Workers Petitioned the Party and Government Yesterday," which involved our factory. I was very surprised to read it. It turns out that our factory, due to the old and dilapidated machinery and buildings, took advantage of the sufficient inventory and sluggish sales to suspend work at the beginning of last month in order to carry out repairs. This was a legitimate matter and was agreed to by the workers, giving them a short rest. Unexpectedly, some unscrupulous elements used this as an excuse to make demands and fabricate stories to deceive the party and government agencies. Our factory, in view of the livelihood of the workers, hurriedly completed the repairs and resumed work as usual on the 23rd of last month. This has been two weeks and there has been no unwarranted suspension of work. At present, all workers are working as usual every day. Therefore, the claim that "the workers' livelihoods are on the verge of ruin" is not true. As for the workers petitioning the party and government during the suspension period, after various agencies sent personnel to the factory to investigate, the facts have been clarified. I am deeply concerned that this may confuse the hearing, so I am writing this letter to request a factual correction. I would be deeply grateful. Sincerely, Pan Guiru, Factory Director of Shanghai China Match Factory, December 11, 25.</p>
<p>To the Editor: According to the representative of the Jue Lu Jiu Ji Dance Hall, after reading your newspaper on the 10th of this month, it was reported that a dancer, Shi Lian, swallowed tranquilizers in an attempt to commit suicide, which is not in line with the facts. It turns out that the dancer went to the Jue Lu Dance Hall to dance at 11:00 PM on the 4th of this month. When it was closing time, the dancer suddenly invited the dancer Chen Lili to go out with him. After Chen politely refused, the dancer roared loudly and slapped the dancer on the cheek before leaving in frustration. At about 6:00 PM on the 9th of this month, the dancer returned to the dance hall, looking angry, and insisted on inviting Chen to go out with him, threatening to commit suicide. Although the dance hall staff explained to him, he continued to mutter to himself. Observing his actions, it seemed that his nerves were suddenly stimulated, so they let him sit alone in a corner, not suspecting that he had other intentions. Unexpectedly, the dancer stubbornly took the tranquilizers he had brought with him in an attempt to commit suicide. It was regrettable. After it was discovered, the police car was immediately called to send him to the hospital for treatment. He has been cured and was discharged from the hospital that night, accompanied home by someone. He is safe and sound. Therefore, a letter was sent to the dance hall requesting that it be corrected on its behalf in order to conform to the facts. Accordingly, a representative letter is sent to your newspaper, and I hope that it will be corrected to conform to the facts. Sincerely, Lawyer Xi Wenhuan, December 11.</p>

<p>Women's Special Issue</p>
<h3>Supporting Suiyuan and the Responsibility of Women</h3>
<p>— De Lin</p>
<p>The current serious situation in China is the result of the encroachment and annexation by ×× imperialist powers. The outbreak of the Suiyuan Incident and the recent invasion by bandits and puppets were undoubtedly directed and instigated by its behind-the-scenes operators. Everyone knows that Suiyuan is the front line of our national defense and the barrier of the Northwest. Therefore, it is also our lifeline. For the soldiers fighting on the front line and defending our territory, in addition to cutting back on expenses, donating money, and enthusiastically transporting supplies to replenish the front-line military, fulfilling some of the obligations that citizens should fulfill, we should also give our all to the country. Although the enemy is attacking one of our provinces, its aim is to annex the entire country. The fact is very obvious. If it occupies our Suiyuan, it can control Shanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, and other provinces. Wouldn't the entire North China and Northwest fall completely into its grasp? So I say, supporting Suiyuan is supporting ourselves. We strong young people should of course make full preparations to protect our territory and complete sovereignty. However, our fellow women, who are also part of the 450 million compatriots, should unite with us, stand on the same front, and follow the example of Spanish women, who bravely defend their country for their own survival and freedom.</p>
<p>Spanish women not only work in the rear, but also rush to the front line to fight bloody battles. But looking back at the women in our country, they are still intoxicated in pink dreams, indulging in meaningless love affairs, and putting on makeup is a daily routine. Looking at the consumables consumed in Shanghai in the first ten months of this year, the total value of imported cosmetics and perfumes is over 1.1 million yuan. I think that in this critical moment of life and death, those aristocratic romantic lives are not needed. What is needed is a brave and active spirit, and the cultivation of habits of endurance and hard work. Look at Germany after the European War, where children went to school barefoot. In the Soviet Union after the revolution, people ate black bread. And Japanese women have the perseverance to work hard. Abyssinian women took up guns and went to the front line. Aren't these good examples for us?</p>
<p>Compatriots in the national women's community, please be aware! This is the critical moment of our life and death. If you have the same spirit of Spanish women bravely defending the country, at the very least, please save the money you spend on cosmetics and perfumes every day and donate it to the soldiers bravely fighting on the front line, contributing a little bit of a citizen's obligation based on your own patriotism.</p>
<h3>My View of Modern Women</h3>
<p>— Hu Feng</p>
<p>—After reading "How to Be a Modern Woman"—</p>
<p>In the 43rd issue of this publication, an article entitled "How to Be a Modern Woman" was published, proposing three conditions that modern women should possess: first, a sound physique; second, simple habits; and third, an independent spirit.</p>
<p>I believe that these three conditions are not enough for modern women. At the very least, they must also possess:</p>
<p>Fourth, an understanding of their own position.</p>
<p>The reason why women in the past would "follow the chicken if they marry a chicken, and follow the dog if they marry a dog," resulting in being poisoned by dependence, was not only due to economic dependence and lack of an independent spirit, but also because they deliberately pretended to have willow waists and golden lotuses with their very healthy bodies; they deliberately applied makeup to their faces, which contained natural beauty, to win the favor of men. All of this stemmed from economic dependence, but on the other hand, it was also because they forgot their own position and were willing to treat themselves as toys for men. This is why they were so easily bullied, played with, or looked down upon. All of these were due to a lack of understanding of their own position. We only need to see that many women in history who were able to serve the country all used the famous saying "Every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country" as their creed. The reason why they had great careers to show was because they did not underestimate themselves and let men establish their achievements. In the Republic, Qiu Jin was a revolutionary martyr. She took revolution as her own responsibility, so she lived for revolution and died for revolution.</p>
<p>In summary, if women do not have an understanding of their own position, then I believe that the demand for women's economic independence will never succeed, no matter what. At most, it will only add some fashionable slogans in words, with no benefit to the facts. It's like modern women in China, at a time when the country is in such a critical state of survival, we should all recognize that we are also part of the 400 million people. Everyone should do their best for the country so that the country can gain equality and freedom, and then from the country's aspect, we can strive for our equality and freedom. This equality and freedom is true equality and true freedom. With true equality and true freedom, then economic independence will be truly achieved. Therefore, modern women must not lose their own position. In other words, women are also people, so people naturally have personality. I hope that modern women will recognize their own position and maintain their personality!</p>
<h3>Reading Newspapers and Concerned People</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>The Persecution of Modern Professional Women (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Shouzhen</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to a friend's house and talked about our respective living conditions. She complained with great indignation about the boredom of her life in recent years. She was originally a highly educated person, but annual childbirth after marriage deprived her of her health, and differences of opinion between husband and wife caused great damage to her spirit.</p>
<p>In order to avoid dependence and to provide for the family, she had repeatedly discussed with her husband about finding a job in society. Her husband, whom she had been in love with for five or six years before marrying, actually said to her like this: "No, this is absolutely impossible. I would rather endure the hardship of maintaining this family alone than have you seek employment. To be honest, today's society is a male-centered society. If a woman wants to get a position in society, she only needs two conditions: one is that she has already reached a shameful compromise with a man in a certain department, and the other is that a certain point of that woman—academic and talent are not included—is enough to make men want to help her. Otherwise, don't even bother to run into a wall. To put it more thoroughly, men have no one with a serious mentality towards women. If you find a job in society now, that means at least one man is harboring ill intentions towards you." When she heard this, she was furious and had a big fight with him. When she told me about it, I couldn't help but be furious!</p>
<p>But when we calmly think and observe, does his statement conform to the general situation today? It is true that there are women who completely create their own position with their own strength, and there are also many women who completely rely on their own labor to seek their own lives. But the situation he described is indeed not uncommon. This is the reason why the careers of women in general cannot develop today, and it is also a kind of persecution of modern professional women!</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the persecution that women in general suffer:</p>
<p>The purpose of female waitresses in ordinary tea houses and restaurants in Shanghai is to attract business. Why can they attract business by using female waitresses? The reason is very simple: "Because they are women." So what do we think is going on in the minds of their employers and those customers towards women who came to seek a legitimate job? Do they treat them as professional women with personality? Therefore, women who are determined to be independent have to suffer humiliation in order to be independent, otherwise they cannot be independent.</p>
<p>When business in stores is slack, they can use female shop assistants to recover. When theaters are about to close, they use ushers to attract customers. Are they promoting women's rights? Are they giving women jobs? They are only using a general shameless concept to attract a group of bored and shameless customers. What kind of persecution is this for women!</p>
<h3>The 69-Year-Old Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Jichen</p>
<p>I am now writing about a 69-year-old female educator. Her name is Luo Shujun. She is American and has been in China for forty years. She has never married and is a practitioner of singleness. She says: "I have lived for sixty or seventy years and have never been in love." She founded Chongzhen Girls' School in Changzhou, initially as a primary school, but now with a junior high school added. The results are remarkable, earning her widespread trust and respect from society. She is a Christian, and her entire life's work is based on God's words and deeds. Despite her "rare age," she possesses a healthy body and a sharp mind. In China, such a highly respected "old maid" is probably a rare find.</p>
<p>This spring, she felt that the Chongzhen Girls' School, which she had painstakingly built, was still not satisfactory. At the same time, many of the school's staff wanted to repay her for her dedication to education. Therefore, they initiated a celebration for Miss Luo's birthday, using the congratulatory gifts as an education fund. On the red invitation cards, they frankly and unceremoniously stated: "If you are willing to contribute generously, please donate in legal tender."</p>
<p>The scale of the event at that time was truly a sensation throughout the entire city of Changzhou. The birthday hall was set up in the school and was very magnificent. Red curtains were hung all around, and a silver statue of the God of Longevity was placed on the center table, in the same format as a Chinese birthday celebration. Five-tenths of the guests who came to offer birthday wishes were Americans, but the banquet was Chinese-style, with chopsticks, bowls, and spoons, adding a lot of laughter to the dining hall that day.</p>
<p>Her attitude was very sincere. She was accustomed to speaking fluent Chinese and liked to talk about her own history. Her first sentence was always: "I love China." Indeed, she regarded China as her second "motherland." When she was thirteen years old, she thought of coming to China, but her family did not allow it. She strove tirelessly to realize her "China dream." As a result, where there's a will, there's a way. Finally, at the age of twenty-eight, she arrived in China. She initially went to Songjiang and established the Bible Girls' School, making it her life's mission to save poor school-age children and preach. When she arrived in Changzhou, there were very few foreigners in the interior. As a result, some naughty children would follow Miss Luo when she ran into the street, shouting and scolding. Every day, one could hear the insults "foreign devil," "monkey," and "night ghost"!</p>
<p>She said: "I believe in God. God taught me to preach, God taught me to dedicate myself to education, and God taught me to endure hardship." Therefore, although she felt troubled, the light of victory and glory shone in her future, and she always showed a smiling face in the midst of trouble. Therefore, she only had the masses and forgot herself. In her forty years in China, she had no savings at all. She was a "self-made" creator. She used her brain and hands to open up a wasteland and sow seeds, which is why there is today's phenomenon of "peach and plum filling the gate." In these forty years, not only was her spirit admirable, but also her great morality and pure personality left a good impression on people.</p>
<p>In its early days, Chongzhen Girls' School was three simple bungalows. The location was small, the air was not well-circulated, and there were only twenty or thirty students. The only girls went to the "foreign devil's" school. However, she was not discouraged and continued to work hard. In its middle period, Chongzhen moved to a new location, three small Western-style houses, with all the necessary school equipment. The number of students also increased. Now, it has progressed from a full primary school to the addition of a junior high school. The school buildings are brand new and full of vitality! On the one hand, we celebrate her success, and on the other hand, we look forward to even greater development in the future.</p>
<p>We feel that how many people are willing to sacrifice themselves for society, for a certain cause, and frankly and vigorously stand up and move forward? What should women who enter social circles do?</p>

<h3>The Miserable Pain of Prostitutes</h3>
<p>— Ding Xiaoru</p>
<p>—Thoughts on the "Death of Sai Jinhua"—</p>
<p>Prostitutes—the "wives" of the masses, the "mistresses" of the masses!</p>
<p>They dress up in "splendid clothes," they sell their "youth."</p>
<p>They swallow their own "sorrowful tears," only caring about others' "joy."</p>
<p>They regard themselves as "lambs," often subject to the "trampling" and "slaughter" of hungry tigers.</p>
<p>Their sense of "sex" is numb, their concept of "shame" is extinguished, but their sense of "hunger" is particularly acute.</p>
<p>They solve others' "sexual" hunger and thirst to solve their own hunger.</p>
<p>The money they earn by selling their bodies can only be used for the extravagance of the procuress, and their own lives are not even as good as a dog's.</p>
<p>The so-called "brightness" in their eyes is only legal tender, white rice grains, and glittering tears.</p>
<p>They give "loners" supreme "comfort" and "revelry."</p>
<p>They give people who have never known the "taste of tenderness" unlimited "tender" pleasure.</p>
<p>They give many satisfactions to those whose "marriages are unsatisfactory."</p>
<p>They can turn "miserly" people into "generous" people, and "evil" people into practitioners of "charitable" causes.</p>
<p>They are infected with a lot of "prosperity" and suffer all kinds of "insults."</p>
<p>They are truly infected with "bad diseases," ruin their bodies, and are then "cursed" for it.</p>
<p>They are often used as a sign of "mockery" and "abuse."</p>
<p>They do not know what position they occupy in society. Perhaps it is somewhere between "human" and "animal"?</p>
<p>But in fact, they are also "people," they are also "women" in this so-called era of "women first," the same as those praised by men.</p>
<p>Their end is mostly to die "coldly" in a small, dark room, naked or with only crows and magpies to peck at them, and wild dogs to drag them away. These cursed, pitiful, and also respectable (?)—special women!</p>
<h3>Private Secretary (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xueying</p>
<p>After Shao Yi had a big argument with her father the night before about whether or not to go abroad, Shao Wen wanted to drag her to see Brain Munshira's "Maiden's Complaint" today, but she stubbornly refused, just sitting at home listlessly by herself. Later, she was so bored that she could not stand it, so she picked up a copy of the Shen Bao for the day and read it from beginning to end. She read it very carefully, not even missing the advertisements, so she discovered a small advertisement that made her feel a little moved. The advertisement said:</p>
<p>"Hiring one private secretary, limited to women. Must be a graduate or student of a university liberal arts department for more than two years. Salary is ninety yuan per month for the first month, and will increase annually thereafter. Working hours are five hours per day. Please submit photos to ×× Law Firm and report for trial."</p>
<p>Although a monthly salary of ninety yuan is not a very large sum, it was enough for Shao Yi, a daughter from a well-to-do family who only needed to buy some clothes and pocket money, and did not have to take care of her family. But what especially pleased her was that she only needed to work five hours a day? Nowadays, the average work hours of general agencies are seven or eight hours. How could a young lady like her do it? Her father said yesterday: "Go abroad? Do you know how much money that costs? You haven't earned any money yourself, so you don't know how difficult it is to make money!" These words were very hurtful to her, so she decided to earn some money herself to show her father.</p>
<p>Taking photos and registering were all done surprisingly well. Later, someone sent a letter inviting her to an interview. Because she was afraid that things would not work out and turn into a joke, she boldly went alone, without even letting her sister Shao Wen know. Although the place for the interview was a lawyer's office, the person who actually interviewed her was not the lawyer. He said that he was the one hiring the private secretary, only because he was friends with the lawyer, so he borrowed his place as a correspondence address. There was no need to worry about that, but what exactly did he do? Why did he need a private secretary? And why did he have to use a female private secretary for some reason? These circumstances really should be asked carefully, but Shao Yi, who had no knowledge of the depths of society, dared to pursue her future employer in her mind like this! She allowed that guy to automatically tell her some things: his surname was Wu, he was a returned British student studying literature, and he recently wanted to run a literary publication, hoping that she could help him translate some things. The matter was decided in this way.</p>
<p>On the third day, Shao Yi started working. That Mr. Wu, the literary man, rented a small office in a certain building, hung up the sign of "New Moon Magazine Department," and started to compile his magazine with great pride. When Shao Yi went back on the first day after starting work, she seemed a little uneasy. First, the staff of the New Moon Magazine Department consisted of only her and that Mr. Wu, plus a child who was often sent out to do errands. Only one man and one woman were sitting opposite each other inside, and the atmosphere seemed a little different. Second, that Mr. Wu treated her too well, without any airs. Writing desks were arranged face-to-face, all the utensils were very exquisite, and there were also many fruits and expensive coffee candies prepared on a wall shelf, and he constantly and sincerely sent them over and invited her to eat. At noon, he also invited her to have Western food together, and sent a car to take her home, just like entertaining a guest. Third, not only had she not done any work herself, but that Mr. Wu had not been seen to move a pen once. This was too mysterious, and Shao Yi hardly slept all night. But the next day, there was an even more mysterious fact discovered. When she just left her house at 8:30, she saw that Mr. Wu's chauffeur was waiting outside. She naturally could not refuse, so she got in the car. This was not all. At noon, that Mr. Wu very sincerely treated her to a Chinese meal again. In the afternoon, near 4:00, that child bought two movie tickets for the balcony seats. Next was watching a movie, eating dinner, and taking a car to send her home.</p>
<h3>A Record of the National Heroine Ms. Wa</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Female heroes, throughout history, are too numerous to count, but those who fought for the survival of the country and the nation, besides Liang Hongyu and Qin Liangyu, who have a very glorious record, are rarely heard of. The Ms. Wa of Tianzhou mentioned here, although not as well-known as the aforementioned Liang and Qin, still leaves an indelible impression on us in the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang because of the joy of killing the enemy at that time.</p>
<p>During the 14th year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty, pirates invaded on a large scale along the southeast coast. At that time, the country had been at peace for a long time, military preparations were not in good repair, and the defending soldiers retreated at every turn, allowing them to enter the interior. The area along the Sujia Road, in particular, was ravaged, with people scattered and houses turned into ruins! It was almost occupied as a base camp. At that time, Ms. Wa of Tianzhou was known for her bravery. The court ordered her to conquer the pirates. Ms. Wa only led a thousand of her wolf soldiers and asked the way to come to help. Upon arriving, she asked the local officials to capture snakes as food. She attacked the pirates with the government army between Wangjiangjing and Beiche of Wujiang, defeating them greatly, beheading more than two thousand people. The elite of the pirates were almost completely annihilated. The corpses piled up in the fields. The wolf soldiers often dried their meat and ate it with snakes. For a time, the people were very happy. At that time, a very majestic folk song was popular: "The Hua Wa family can kill the pirates, dry and eat them like snakes." This is a song about this matter.</p>
<p>Special Report of this Newspaper</p>
<h3>Dr. Su Zengxiang Discusses Women's Rights and Women's Abilities</h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>With women's abilities, there will be women's rights. It is better to fight for human rights than for women's rights; only with the ability to be independent can one manage a family. In managing domestic affairs, do not forget to save the country.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the women's movement, most people always think, is to fight for "women's rights." It seems that for thousands of years, women's rights have been completely deprived by men, and now that the law stipulates equal rights for men and women, and women have the opportunity to be liberated, they should fight back for the lost women's rights. In fact, this is a prejudice, not a correct argument. Men and women are both human beings and should not be divided into different categories. Everyone should strive for "human rights." To put it more broadly, our entire Chinese nation has been subjected to the bullying and humiliation of foreign races for the past hundred years. In the face of this great disaster, we should unite to fight for the liberation and freedom of the Chinese nation. Therefore, between men and women, in addition to working together, there should be no distinction between "us" and "them." Now, many people in the women's world sympathize with this view, and Dr. Su Zengxiang is one of them. She is originally from Chongming and studied in Germany and Austria, specializing in pediatrics, and also investigated the latest childcare methods in various European countries. Last year, she returned to China. In addition to her medical practice, she also serves as a health consultant for the Modern Parents Monthly, providing free answers to various questions about children's health for parents across the country. This is an extremely important and meaningful work. The other day, I went to her clinic in Xinhuayuan, Jing'an Temple, and talked to her for a while. The following are her main opinions.</p>
<p>"I usually don't want to talk about this set of equal rights for men and women. I think talking about 'women's rights' out of thin air may not be effective. As long as you keep to your duty, do your best, and be practical, she will have women's rights to enjoy. To fight for 'women's rights,' you must first have 'women's abilities.' All women who have a skill are considered to have 'women's abilities,' and even handling household affairs is one of women's abilities. Once you have the 'ability,' you will have the 'right' without fighting for it; if you do not have the ability, even if you fight for the 'right,' it is only temporary and cannot be enjoyed for long. By extension, women who have the ability should seek 'human rights,' and do not need to fuss about the struggle for 'women's rights.' I once heard Hitler say, 'Women should go home!' He seemed to mean that all women should go home, which I think is too arbitrary. Some women are doing practical work in society, so are they supposed to give it up and stop doing it? These words are very necessary for certain families, but women cannot pay too much attention to social services. Doing a good job in household affairs is also as meritorious as helping the community; the ancients said, 'Cultivate your person, regulate your family, order your state, and pacify the world.' The family is the cell of social organization, so it cannot be ignored. Therefore, I advocate that men should focus on their careers, while women should focus on their families."</p>
<p>"Nowadays, the average woman really lacks knowledge of managing a family and raising children. I think that in girls' high schools, in addition to stipulating home economics courses, they should add basic knowledge of child health care, because single women are ultimately a minority. Since everyone is going to get married and have children, of course they need to study it. For girls who have dropped out of school, this kind of knowledge should also be taught in literacy schools; children are the masters of the future, so how can they be ignored? Based on my past medical experience, I feel that most housewives suffer both mental and physical losses due to lack of basic knowledge of family hygiene, and those responsible for education should find ways to remedy this. Second, the average lady does not have the habit of reading books or newspapers. Although they are limited by their daily work, on the one hand, it can also be said that they give up their desire for knowledge. Otherwise, no matter how busy they are, they can at least take an hour each day for self-study. I once read in a Western magazine that a mother can read five pages of a book while breastfeeding her child three months after birth, which shows their diligence in reading. If it were a Chinese housewife, she could draw a cigarette or play a game of cards while breastfeeding, which is really not necessarily a joke."</p>
<p>I also asked her what kind of responsibility the women's world should bear since the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan and the serious situation. She said, "With the national crisis at this point, the future situation may become even more tense. Women should work hard in the rear, for example: strengthening family responsibilities, such as inspiring children's patriotic thoughts, encouraging husbands to save the country; studying nursing and first aid; increasing knowledge of air defense and poison gas; saving family expenses and donating to national defense; participating in fundraising and comfort missions to the soldiers at the front; making clothes for the soldiers, such as gloves, earmuffs, and silk cotton vests. I am only afraid that the physique of our women's world is too poor to be able to endure hardship, and that they are used to enjoying a comfortable life and relying on maids for everything. How will they cope in wartime? In short, we must prepare as soon as possible now, so that even if disaster strikes, we will not panic. Like me personally, I have made up my mind on this. Once there is a mobilization order, I will rush to the battlefield, without hesitation, and sacrifice myself for the country, which is the most glorious end in life!"</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Not Loving the Country, But Loving the Beauty</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The marriage issue between King Edward VIII of England and Mrs. Simpson has been brewing for many days, causing unrest in the political situation. Only yesterday did it announce that King Edward VIII of England abdicated, and his younger brother, the Duke of York, succeeded to the throne. This issue of King Edward's marriage to Mrs. Simpson has been going on for a long time, and it can be considered that it has come to an end.</p>
<p>Our country originally had the famous line of not loving the country, but loving the beauty, but in our country, there are few people who can truly not love the country and love the beauty. For example, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang loved Yang Guifei very much, but by the time of the Mawei Mutiny, he had no choice but to not love the beauty and love the country. Now, King Edward VIII of England has a firm and unyielding attitude, willing to sacrifice the throne and not abandon the beauty. This attitude is not only absent in our country's history, but also unseen in the history of various countries. One cannot but say that it is the first major romance case in history.</p>
<p>In fact, breaking through the Eastern mirror to say, life is but a few decades, so enjoy the pleasure. For King Edward, sitting high on the throne, living in wealth and honor, to outsiders, it must be very carefree and enviable, but in the place of King Edward, he certainly does not feel any interest. England is a country with a responsible cabinet system, and the power of the monarch is very weak. Even in the case of Mrs. Simpson, he already deeply feels the pain of not being able to be free. Therefore, the King of England would rather get pleasure in spirit than get comfort in form, and would rather be somewhat wronged in form than be in pain in spirit.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, it is easy to find priceless treasures, but hard to find a lover, and a thousand gold pieces cannot buy a smile. If something is pleasing to me, I will spare no sacrifice to acquire it. Human nature is mostly like this, but King Edward of England is willing to sacrifice the throne rather than sacrifice the beauty. Observers often regret that the price is too great. There are many beautiful women in the world, so why bother like this? But this saying is only for those who have not fallen into the web of love. If you have already entered the web of love and want to get rid of it, it is not easy.</p>
<p>Therefore, I greatly feel that King Edward's firm and unyielding spirit is unattainable. He has made a solemn promise to Mrs. Simpson to marry her and will never break his promise, and he is willing to sacrifice the throne in order to fulfill his promise. In this, we can see even more that the King's personality is commendable. The throne can be abandoned like worn-out shoes, but the promise will never be broken. How can such a personality be easily found? Perhaps some people are suspicious because of Mrs. Simpson's three marriages, but this is indeed a difference in each person's vision.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>— Liao Chu Xiu</p>
<p>When I was a child, I longed for a building, a building that I could climb. There were no buildings in the rural markets. Although some things could be piled on the roof of the shops, there were no windows. Climbing in was dark and did not give people the feeling of climbing a building.</p>
<p>Behind my mother's back, I sometimes climbed onto the wooden ladder that leaned against the eaves. With a fearful heart, I looked around, and the crowded houses formed a sea of tiles. The setting sun smeared them into golden scales, which reminded me of the ripples of spring water reflecting the setting sun. In the sea of tiles, I could also see some trees of various kinds: the unrestrained and elegant posture of willows, the melancholy aura of loquats, especially the locust leaves, which reminded me of duckweed in the spring water.</p>
<p>Sometimes I looked up even higher. The clear blue sky seemed to cover the roof, and the light white clouds almost brushed my nose. So I thought of a building even more.</p>
<p>Without waiting for my mother to look for me, I quietly walked down the ladder. So I spent a long afternoon in the courtyard surrounded by a very high wall. I carefully searched for the small grass in the shadow of the wall, patiently adjusted the war of the ants, but I did not forget a building that could be climbed.</p>
<p>So I looked up again. The small white clouds flew very fast, and my heart flew with the white clouds to the sea of tiles smeared with the setting sun.</p>
<p>After leaving my hometown, I often lived in buildings, but I only felt the existence of "building" a few times, and that I had really climbed a building.</p>
<p>It was three years ago in late spring that I floated to Suzhou alone. It was already dusk when I walked up the restaurant building with travel sorrows.</p>
<p>The building faced west, and the setting sun cast shadows on the railing, allowing people to clearly see the passing of youth. Opposite the restaurant was a row of weeping willows, dressed in their new clothes of March, with long branches hanging straight to the ground. Because the evening mist was rising, the willow branches were especially hazy.</p>
<p>Leaning on the dangerous railing, I silently looked into the distance. The crimson setting sun in the willow branches was still reluctant to go down. Outside the setting sun and smoky willows, a strand of green mountains, like long eyebrows in a dream, faded into the evening mist.</p>
<p>A piece of market noise, along with the evening wind, swept straight over, and I began to feel that I was in a foreign land. "Don't mention other words, whose house will I stay in tonight?" I repeatedly chanted, gently patting the railing with one hand.</p>
<p>The setting sun finally went down, and the twilight was especially thick. I did not know where the returning team call in the nearby barracks was blowing.</p>
<p>The street lights flickered on, and a row of carriages flowed like water downstairs.</p>
<p>It was in the autumn of that year that I went alone to a small town by the river. This was not my destination, because it was raining, so I stopped halfway. There were a total of four or five hundred families in the small town. I stayed in the only tall building at the end of the market.</p>
<p>The rain was not heavy, but it was very even, without a break for five or six hours. Because I was going to another place tomorrow, this temporary stay brewed my travel sorrows like wine.</p>
<p>The small town was still a mile or two away from the riverbank, but from the building, I could see the Yangtze River. The rain was unusually hazy, making the Yangtze River a gray and white expanse. The clouds and trees across the river, which should have been seen clearly, were now a gray and black expanse.</p>
<p>Sometimes black sails划过江中, but because the rain was 重使得人感到十分费力, I好像觉得自己在坐在一只小船上, 在这暮雨的秋江上, 沿着江边, 由几个舟子吃力的撑着前进. 于是本来浓厚的旅愁, 就像铅块一样的压在心上。</p>
<p>It was hard to make the black sails cut through the river, but because the rain was solemn, it made people feel very laborious. I seemed to feel like I was sitting on a small boat, on this autumn river in the evening rain, along the river, with a few boatmen struggling to move forward. So the originally strong travel sorrows were pressed on my heart like lead blocks.</p>
<p>It was night, and the rain was still patiently falling. I just leaned on the building window.</p>
<p>The market was a piece of black, and the autumn river was also a piece of black, but I clearly felt that I was standing on a highest building, "Jinling passed through Xiaoshan Building, a traveller can be sad for one night!" I thought of whose poem.</p>
<h3>The Flute Player</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>Ping Jiugeng never enjoyed a golden childhood!</p>
<p>His innocent childish heart was held tightly in his father's palm. All day long, he seemed to have a great deal of unspoken bitterness left in his heart. He constantly furrowed his brow, living a very dull life.</p>
<p>It was spring! He could only watch groups of children tumbling and playing on the green grassland, or studying, practicing calligraphy, and singing free songs in the school next door... He always sighed and secretly reddened his eyes!</p>
<p>His father was an old man with a hunched back, a monkey's face, and two protruding, very fierce eyes. He also had old-fashioned tempers, which he often used to deal with his child, forbidding him from running wild and being foolish like children… If Jiugeng's legs occasionally itched, and he ran out the door, or sneaked into the school next door to listen to the sound of reading, the old man would mercilessly scold him loudly:</p>
<p>"Little bastard! Good-for-nothing... get in here and do your homework!"</p>
<p>Hearing the scolding, he would obediently sit in the dim corner, twist his neck, and practice this damned bamboo flute, less than two feet long, with a "hissing" sound, even if it was hot and he was sweating, or in the dead of winter, with his ten fingertips frozen stiff, his father would not allow him any slack.</p>
<p>The old man had his own experience to draw on; he said that to develop a good skill, one must temper the flute through hardship, so that he could inherit his lifetime career of being a flute player for funerals.</p>
<p>A year passed! Under his father's coercion, Jiugeng had memorized all the "gong che" notes thoroughly, and now he could even play "Tian Xia Tong" (1) by himself, and he was doing it quite well.</p>
<p>His father was naturally extremely happy! He often accompanied his flute playing, singing the upper tune (2), clapping the beat, and sometimes even excitedly jumping around on his two skinny legs.</p>
<p>In front of people, he often boasted about his capable child:</p>
<p>"Hehe! Our Jiugeng is really growing up!... You see, these days, farmers suffer so much! And the harvest is so unpredictable... That's why I'm letting my child learn this family business, so that I'll have someone to rely on in the future!..."</p>
<p>Often, people would express the same sentiment about his remarks: nodding, or praising the father's insightful views. - How satisfying and pleasant that was for the old man!</p>
<p>But this statement actually hit a wall, causing one person to express dissatisfaction. The other person was Mr. Yu, the young teacher at the village primary school.</p>
<p>One summer evening, while enjoying the cool air, Mr. Yu, carrying his books, said to him very seriously face-to-face in the open square in front:</p>
<p>"Your Jiugeng is very smart! A child like that could study for a few years, let him increase his knowledge, so that in the future..."</p>
<p>"Um, um! Teacher! Gotta make a living! This family business isn't easy to take over!" The old man interrupted before he could finish.</p>
<p>The other person sighed:</p>
<p>"I think that children of school age, no matter how heavily burdened by life, still need to be instilled with some knowledge..."</p>
<p>"...It's not like I don't know a single word, don't read a single book - and I've still managed half my life!"</p>
<p>The response immediately darkened his face, seeming displeased.</p>
<p>"The past was the society of the past! But in the future, I dare say that one cannot survive without education."</p>

<p>Spiritual Pivot and Basic Questions</p>
<p>— Answered by Dr. Liu Xinbai</p>
<p>Syphilis Not Fully Cured</p>
<p>Number 127, Ms. Wang Meijuan asks: I once suffered from syphilis and developed flat condyloma. After seeing your reply, I followed the treatment and recovered completely in a few days. Before that, I suffered from pain in my right shoulder, which was also cured by a certain doctor drawing blood, examining it, and injecting 606. Now everything is normal, only my throat hurts from time to time. I ask (1) Is it that the previous illness is not cured? What is the disease? (2) If the previous illness is not cured, how can I ensure a complete cure? (3) Is it necessary to continue injecting 606?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Yes, it is throat syphilis. (2) Inject six doses of 606, inject 'Carbisin', test the blood once. If there is no toxin, test it again after half a year. If there is toxin, inject it as before. (3) See (2).</p>
<p>Is it Gonorrhea?</p>
<p>Number 128, Mr. Li Xishi asks: I occasionally had intercourse with a prostitute. The next day, I felt a stinging pain when urinating. Two days later, there was white pus in my urine, and the pain was unbearable. I ask (1) Is it gonorrhea? (2) What is the most effective treatment? (3) How can I prevent it from turning into syphilis or orchitis? (4) When can it be considered cured?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Yes. (2) Inject ten doses of 'Sino-Acrindin', then rinse with one percent 'Argent Proteinate'. Take 'Qingzhuobian' from beginning to end without interruption. (3) Syphilis does not develop from gonorrhea, so there is no way to prevent it. With the above treatment, pay special attention to rinsing, which can avoid the danger of orchitis. (4) Please have your urine tested by a health authority. After they finish the test, they will give you a certificate. If the "Gonococcus" item on the certificate is not a plus sign (+), but a minus sign (-), then you can consider yourself cured.</p>
<p>Back Pain from Appendicitis</p>
<p>Number 129, Mr. Cheng Cheyang, No. 9, Beitiao Fang, Beitiao Road, South Chengdu Road, French Concession asks: I am twenty-one years old and live in the French Concession. Four years ago, I suffered from appendicitis. After an X-ray at the Shanghai Hygiene Sanatorium, the doctor said it was chronic appendicitis. Subsequently, an operation was performed on the right side of my abdomen, and a piece of small intestine about half an inch long was removed. This intestine was as hard as a stone. After two months in the hospital, my body gradually returned to normal. However, my spirit could not recover, and my back still felt tired and sore. This illness has been going on for four years, and the suffering in my back has not diminished at all. Therefore, I now send this letter and humbly request your reply: (1) Is there a danger of this condition turning into something worse? (2) What is the treatment? (3) What medicine should I take?</p>
<p>Answer: Appendicitis is quite easy to recur. In addition, you should also be checked for kidney stones, hernias, and pyelonephritis. For appendicitis, a clinical examination is sufficient. For kidney stones and hernias, X-rays and urine tests are needed. For pyelonephritis, a test is also needed. Therefore, it is impossible to determine what disease you currently have without an examination. The treatment must wait until after a definite diagnosis.</p>
<p>Chronic Gonorrhea and Others</p>
<p>Number 30, Mr. Jiang Hong, Municipal Hongmiao Primary School, Datong Road, Gaoqiao, Pudong, asks: (1) Is it effective to self-treat chronic gonorrhea with maintenance medications (such as Gonorrhea Pills, Kelinnong, Mieshalin, Ledineng, Deliping Syphilis Killer, etc.)? (2) Is it reliable that the various venereal disease hospitals advertised in the newspaper "Ten Yuan Covers Treatment, Cure Within a Time Limit, Money Back if Not Cured"? (3) Approximately how much would it cost to treat this disease with a doctor? How many days would it take? (4) Besides rubbing with warm water every day, what medicine can be used to remedy small penis size and premature ejaculation? Are the Vita-Cibao Ming, Haertong, Shouerkang, and Deer Antler Essence sold on the market effective? (5) Sometimes I feel soreness and pain inside my joints. Is this gonorrheal arthritis? (6) I am thin and tall. I would like to take a tonic to develop my muscles and become plump and fat. What medicine is effective? (7) Which obstetrics and gynecology hospital in Shanghai is good and relatively inexpensive?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Rinsing with 'Argent Albrminate' is the most effective. The ingredients of the medicines you asked about in your letter are unclear, and they have not been tested. I have never seen literature on them in medical journals at home and abroad, so I cannot comment. (2) The medical association is cracking down on unethical advertisements and unqualified doctors. But I do not want to criticize them here. (3) If chronic gonorrhea is treated properly, the urine will be clear in about a month, and the bacteria in the urine can be completely eliminated after fifty days. (4) There is currently no surgical method to correct penile deformities. 'Vita-Cibao Ming' is a 'hormone preparation' and is effective in treating premature ejaculation. The ingredients of the following three drugs are unknown. What is 'Deer Antler Essence'? It remains to be studied whether deer antler contains animal alkali (essence). (5) No. 'Gonorrheal arthritis' is not that simple. (6) 'Cod liver oil' can be taken, but it can only make people 'plump and fat' and cannot 'develop muscles'. Muscle development relies entirely on exercise. (7) The Zhongde Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital and the Tongde Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital are both well-known hospitals in Shanghai. A famous private doctor is Dr. Qu Shaoheng.</p>
<p>Cough and Chest Pain</p>
<p>Number 31, Mr. Jiang Shitan, No. 1, Lane 316, Tongfu Road, Shanghai, asks: I have a friend, Mr. Li, who has been feeling unwell recently, so I was specially commissioned to ask you questions. According to Mr. Li, his father died of pulmonary tuberculosis several years ago, and his brother also died of the same disease this spring. Mr. Li contracted a cold about a month ago, with a lot of nasal discharge every day, and a quite severe cough, and sometimes felt a faint pain in his chest. He went for an X-ray examination, and the diagnosis result was: 'The right lung angle is unclear, and the left and right lung hilum shadows are slightly enlarged'. Later, a small amount of sputum that he coughed up was sent for examination. The report said: 'The sputum showed an alkaline reaction', containing a large number of white blood cells and a small amount of epidermal cells and goblet cells, and a small number of 'Micrococcus Catarrh'. His weight has decreased slightly this year, and his complexion is yellow and thin, and he is very haggard. He has taken several bottles of Scott's cod liver oil recently, but it has not been effective. His chest has been in pain recently, his spirits are not good, and he feels uncomfortable. I have several questions to ask, please answer them in detail: (1) What is the phenomenon of having a large number of white blood cells in the disease? What kind of disease is 'Micrococcus Catarrh' associated with? (3) What disease can be diagnosed based on the examination results? (3) What medicine should be used to treat the disease? (5) Is it easy to cure? (6) What does it mean by unclear lung angle, what is the phenomenon? (7) What does it mean by unclean lung hilum shadow? (8) Is there any phenomenon or suspicious point of pulmonary tuberculosis? (9) If it is pulmonary tuberculosis, what medicine can be used to treat it? (10) Is it effective to take cod liver oil to moisten the lungs?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Inflammation of the respiratory tract. (2) Influenza, acute tracheobronchitis, and catarrhal pneumonia all have it in their secretions. (3) The sputum test seems to be bronchitis, and the X-ray examination does have suspicions of tuberculosis. (4) Take 'Kresocal'. (5) It is still easy. (6) There is inflammation or tuberculosis in that area. (7) The phenomenon of tuberculosis in the hilum of the lung. (8) Yes. (9) There are many treatments, and among the therapeutic methods, those that can be different are calcium therapy, such as injecting 'Calchosen' and taking 'Sinocalcin'. (10) The effect of cod liver oil is not to moisten the lungs. Cod liver oil has extremely high nutritional value, which can compensate for the large physical exertion of people suffering from tuberculosis. Maintain human strength to resist tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>Small, Itchy Bumps</p>
<p>Number 32, Mr. Ouyang Zhao, Hai Rong warship, Gaochang Temple, asks: I am a male, 25 years old, and in good health. I contracted a skin disease two years ago. It decreased slightly last winter, but it was not completely cured. It has started again this autumn. The bumps are small with white fluid. They are more itchy after lunch and dinner and when eating stimulating or hot food. If scratched, the skin breaks easily and heals in a day or two. It has now spread all over my body. I have tried applying French 914, Taihe 606, and various ointments. I also wash with medicated soap every two or three days. However, when it heals in one place, it starts in another. It heals here and breaks out there, going on and on. I think it is 'blood dryness', 'damp heat', or 'unclean blood'. I would like to ask your doctor to indicate the treatment: (1) Should I have a blood test? (2) What kind of blood-cleansing injection should I have and in what quantity? (3) Can I take ××'s ×× brand 606 liquid medicine? (4) Is this disease harmful to the body?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) There are no symptoms of syphilis, nor are there any other symptoms related to blood diseases, so it is not necessary to have a blood test. (2) Inject two doses of 'Caloylen' and rub with '10% Spiritrs Balsan Peru'. (3) There is no theoretical basis for taking '606' internally, and its effectiveness is quite doubtful. (4) Of course it is harmful.</p>
<p>Abdominal Mass After Malaria</p>
<p>Number 33, Previous questioner asks: I humbly ask again, my younger brother is eighteen years old. Several years ago, he had malaria and recovered, but a hard mass formed on the left side of his abdomen. It is now the size of a small bowl bottom. It can be moved by hand when lying down, and it is quite painful. I have heard that it is an abdominal mass. Treatment by Chinese and Western doctors has not been effective. My younger brother is very weak and sickly, and I think this mass must be related (the mass is slightly larger when he is sick). (1) Should he have surgery or take medicine to dissolve it? (2) What disease is it? (3) Should there be dietary restrictions? (4) I humbly request your doctor to indicate the detailed treatment!</p>
<p>Answer: The main points of treatment are 'expelling malaria', 'removing the mass', and 'tonifying the blood'. 'Expelling malaria' uses 'quinine preparations' and 'arsenic preparations', 'removing the mass' uses 'arsenic preparations', and 'tonifying the blood' uses 'liver preparations'. 'Quinine preparations' include 'Febnon Tab. Sugar Caated', 'arsenic preparations' include 'Sod Cacddylate', and 'liver preparations' include 'Livemin'. Therefore, these three - 'Febnon Tab. Sugar Caated', 'Sod Cacddylate', and 'Livemin' - whether taken internally or injected, are indispensable. (2) 'Chronic malarial splenomegaly'. (3) Not yet. (4) In those who are ineffective and do not have 'blood stagnation disease', surgical removal is necessary.</p>
<p>Blood in Sputum</p>
<p>Number 34, Mr. Zhang Jianzhong, Henghexiang Silk Shop, No. 14, Fuxing Lane, Beijing Road, asks: I am physically weak and have a lot of phlegm every day, especially in winter. This stubborn disease has lasted for two years. This winter, it has become more severe again. I am listing the symptoms below: Every morning when I get up, I cough loudly, and the phlegm is stuck in my throat, which is quite uncomfortable, as if there is something stuck in my throat, and I can't get it out unless I cough it up. It takes quite a bit of effort to cough up, and I have to breathe strongly before I can cough it out. However, the amount of phlegm coughed up is not much, sometimes only a few round spots; it is gray-black in color, greasy and thick; sometimes there are bright red blood spots embedded in it, which is very frightening and shocking. But I don't cough regularly, my diet is normal, and my energy for work is not reduced. My chest sometimes feels a dull pain, and my body is only thin. Recently, I bought and took pure cod liver oil, but the amount of phlegm has not decreased. I am afraid that if this continues, the disease will become more and more serious and difficult to treat. Therefore, I have specially written this letter. Please tell me: (1) Is it a lung disease? (2) How should I treat it?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Yes. (2) Continue to take 'cod liver oil' as before, and also take 'Kresocal'. Also, please have the hospital inject 'Calchosen'. The former treats the cough, which is close to treating the symptoms, while the latter treats the root cause and surrounds the lesion.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu finished speaking decisively, and then looked at the father and son - Jiugeng had his head turned towards the wide open sky.</p>
<p>However, the old man's rigid intentions remained stubborn, and he did not feel anything about these words.</p>
<p>"I don't want my child to be well-read in the scriptures, more amazing than my old man!..."</p>
<p>He grumbled angrily for a while, and accompanied the child as he scurried into the dim little house.</p>
<p>After that, during the day or at night, the old man routinely supervised his child's practice of that flute, and he was even stricter than before!</p>
<p>The child Jiugeng, on the other hand, was like a monkey under control! Sadness occupied his chest, his life felt even more dull than before, and his brow furrowed even more tightly.</p>
<p>However, his innocent childish heart still maintained its original thoughts, and he did not give up his will to improve because of exploitation. During the day and night, when the bright moonlight shone on the desolate wilderness, he would often sit blankly holding the bamboo flute that his father regarded as his sole possession, leaning against the doorway, his eyes gazing at the surrounding fields, shedding tears from his eyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would even sneak into the school next door when his father went to town, listening to the sound of people reading and those free songs!…</p>
<p>Note: "Tian Xia Tong": is a popular tune in the flute score. In old-fashioned weddings, that tune is used to accompany the bride and groom bowing.</p>
<p>Upper tune: is the jargon of the flute-playing profession, which means teaching the score.</p>
<h3>Winter Evening</h3>
<p>— Luo Yunhua</p>
<p>In the dense thicket of trees at the southwest corner of Xujiahui, he cannot see Shanghai, because he is not eyes, he can only quietly listen to the noise coming from prosperous Shanghai. Trolley car number two, continuously bringing news of bustling Shanghai, or bringing news of Xujiahui back, with its steady and rather clumsy body.</p>
<p>In fact, this place is lovely. In the summer, although there are many mosquitoes, the heat waves seem to be blocked by the woods. Only the long songs of the cicadas and the uniquely beautiful sound of trolley car number two linger and ripple in the calm air.</p>
<p>Living in this place, if nothing bothers you, or if you want to leave behind all social affairs and do some reading and writing, there is nothing better.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1935, because of the needs of life, such as saving on rent, I ran to that place to live. I lived in a spacious front building, facing the sun. Before I even got out of bed in the morning, or even woke up, the sunlight would warmly add a layer of weightless quilt. The light was naturally abundant, and the wind blowing from the fields, without the coal dust of the city, would gently exchange with the air in the room.</p>
<p>I lived this semi-rural life comfortably. Although I felt the heavy pressure of great loneliness.</p>
<p>Especially in early winter, like these days of not-so-cold weather, the kind of life full of village flavor, after eating dinner, gave me great interest.</p>
<p>Do you like to drink? It's good to drink a little to warm your heart, when you come back from the street and have been buffeted by the wind. Buy a little wine and a bag of peanuts, both are cheap and wonderful goods. You can read the evening paper while drinking. Of course, it would be best to have a close friend sitting across from you, reminiscing about funny past events, or talking about just read books or just heard things, all of which would be just great.</p>
<p>At that time, you can only hear the long and beautiful sounds of the tram passing by.</p>
<p>If there is no wind outside, along Hongqiao Road, on the way to the International Cemetery, the lights shine sparsely, and only the asphalt pavement in the middle of the road emits a firm glow. Perhaps because it is winter and it is night, the road is frozen and more solid. The sound of leather shoes passing by powerfully stirs the surrounding open fields.</p>
<p>Walk slowly by yourself along the neatly cultivated vegetable beds, along a hard ridge in the middle of the soft, loose soil. Sing your favorite songs in a low voice, and pour your emotions of joy and sorrow into the vast fields. They have an incomparably broad mind that can accept everything from you.</p>
<p>Or, just stand there and look at Shanghai, lying behind Xujiahui. At that time, I remember, once, I stood on the side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway passing through Xujiahui, in front of me was the railway, the electric lights were weakly shining, and only a reflective rail lay horizontally on the gray ballast, like a subservient slave of non-resistance, waiting for the heavy pressure of the train. On both sides are fields and villas hidden in the thickets. Looking forward, is the frivolous and leaping city that is just starting its nightlife: the sky is burned red by the electric red lights and has become an unnatural red, as if a layer of uneven old paint has been applied to a good canvas. The lights of the cars swept over like searchlights, and the outlines of houses and trees quickly appeared and then disappeared into the darkness again. Your own face also lights up for a moment, and your eyes shyly dodge away. However, you can only see these light and shadow, you can't hear the sound, you can't even hear the sound of the tram not far away. There are only a few farmers or Tongwen College students working or walking heavily.</p>
<p>You or me, or anyone, standing here, seems to be isolated from the world, but there is often a feeling that Shanghai is a guy suffering from depression, and Xujiahui is still healthy. Although, if you think about it carefully, this is not very accurate.</p>
<p>Every night, I ran to the fields to look at the lights and shadows of the city. I didn't come back until the night wind picked up or it rained.</p>
<p>However, I was not able to stay there for long. Shanghai is like a magnet, and I am a piece of iron filings. The attraction of that magnet is strong, because there are my partners there, so I was attracted back and squeezed together with the iron filings.</p>
<p>However, I still remember the scene of these winter evenings for several months, and I send him a high degree of admiration. I hope that one day, when our cultural rest park is opened up, we will choose this lovely place so that we can enjoy the embrace of nature with peace of mind and breathe the sweet air without the smell of coal smoke.</p>

<h3>A Further Word to Yihua Company</h3>
<p>We are delighted that our humble and straightforward views have received a response from Yihua Film Company; at the same time, we are also disappointed because Yihua Company's response clearly does not understand our meaning.</p>
<p>Out of love for Yihua Company, and even more so out of love for the Chinese film industry, we presented sincere advice to Yihua Company with a fervent heart. Anyone who has read that "Respectful Announcement" letter, we believe, can see the sincerity in it. Now, this "fervent heart" has been misinterpreted as "malicious abuse," which is truly regrettable. To avoid trouble, we could have remained silent, but while it is Yihua Company's right to accept or not accept the advice of public opinion, we still have an obligation to contribute our humble opinions to the film industry. Therefore, we are still willing to offer an unnecessary response.</p>
<p>After "Bridal Night", what was the objective impact of Yihua Company's subsequent works on the audience? This can be "determined" by "the national film audience with a fair and impartial standpoint." At the time, we also published detailed criticisms in various newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them here. The thematic explanations of the various films listed in Yihua Company's response may seem to have sufficient reasons in writing, but the works themselves express it very clearly. The theme cannot be distorted by words. Justice resides in the hearts of the people, and facts are the most eloquent. We will leave the final judgment to the discerning audience.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that "producers and close friends of the heart and audience become one, and carefully create based on the needs of the audience" is the way out for Chinese films. What is meant by "becoming one with the audience" is not "flattering a small number of backward audiences, preying on their weaknesses, and catering to their preferences with various erotic and detective-like low-level interests," but rather "enriching the content while improving technical standards." Whether from a cultural standpoint or a commercial standpoint, this is an unshakeable truth. If Yihua Company believes that these opinions are all "misinterpretations and distortions," then there is naturally nothing to say; otherwise, all disputes are superfluous. As for "toilet scenery and bathroom nude shadows" being forcibly linked to "national culture," then we can only remain silent.</p>
<p>In short, our advice is only for the advancement of the Chinese film and cultural enterprise. We have been rigorously carrying out the work of criticism since long ago. We know that "honest advice is unpleasant to the ear, and good medicine is bitter to the mouth," but compelled by justice, we cannot betray our conscience to please others. As for distorting facts and making frivolous accusations, we only consider them shallow and ridiculous and are unwilling to argue.</p>
<p>Finally, we still earnestly hope that Yihua Company will henceforth respond to the criticisms of public opinion with irrefutable facts in order to achieve true victory. Signed by Thirty-Two People (names omitted)</p>
