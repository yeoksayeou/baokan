<h3 id="c43">世界原料分配問題 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>近數日來英美政治家之提出原料分配問題者頗不乏人如美國方面國務卿郝爾主張開放世界原料俾缺乏原料之國家得以和平方法獲致不必採取武力政策英國方面前工黨領袖藍斯堡發表意見以爲欲消弭今日世界之危機唯有重行分配世界之原料而其方法則爲重行分配世界之殖民地前首相路易喬治且爲藍氏聲援主張重行考慮國聯委任統治地問題此等政治家蓋已認定原料爭奪爲戰爭之重要因素而謀所以解决之道矣</p>
<p>郝爾與藍斯堡之議論雖皆側重於原料之分配但其方法則大異其趣蓋郝爾所主張者在以國際協定之方式謀世界原料之自由流通而藍氏所主張者則側重在殖民地之重行分配一點此兩主張之詳細計劃我人猶未窺其涯際恐主張者亦未必卽有具體辦法然其利弊得失則已顯然卽郝爾之主張比較的公允而藍氏之主張則不殊於武力的掠奪何則今日國際人士之所以反對侵略國家者反對其夷人於殖民地之地位耳而重行分配殖民地之主張雖未公然獎勵武力之侵略然不啻已默認其行動之正當此其一再則所謂重行分配殖民地者其義卽爲現有殖民地過多之國家對於殖民地缺乏之國家應分割若干以示均衡此在强國相互授受之際固不失爲一種豪爽而漂亮之行動但於殖民地民族之人格則蔑視甚矣此其二再則眞正合乎國際正義之主張自應將殖民地一併取消而以純粹貿易之方法謀原料之溝通吾則各强國間之矛盾衝突能吾消除猶不可知而殖民地之身分將永無解除之望此其三</p>
<p>雖然此兩主張之有無實際價値要爲一疑問蓋今日野心國家之所以不惜以武力侵略他國者一方面固在爭原料他方面亦在爭市塲故殖民地不僅爲帝國主義者之原料供給地亦爲帝國主義者推銷商品之市塲而原料之所以大感需耍者無非欲維持或擴大其國內之工業如帝國主義者放棄其一部分固有之殖民地則其國內工業之維持與擴大因失去一部分市塲之故勢將成爲問題且如目前事實所昭示各國對於其勢力所及之市塲則莫不設法封鎖之而於其力所不及之市塲則又竭力爭奪之前者所用之方法爲高建己國之關稅壁壘使他國商品難以輸入後者所用之方法則爲貨幣貶價之匯兌傾銷此二武器今之强國莫不銳意用之絕不反顧乃謂彼等已可商討殖民地之重新分配得無昧於事實之眞態耶至郝爾之主張則覺陳義過高難有結果蓋其所包括者不僅爲原料之分配而市塲之分配亦包含在內市塲果將以若何比率分配之此實一大難題也</p>
<p>總之藍斯堡之辦法乃以暴易暴之辦法此種辦法於强國之間固不失爲慷慨第於弱小無吿之民族則徒見其不仁至郝氏之辦法則鑒於一九三三年世界經濟會議及今次海軍會議之覆轍恐亦無良好之結果也</p>

<p>（十）自治風雲中之慘象</p>
<p>北平爲遼金元明淸歷代之故都、民國初肇、仍設中央政府於此、十六年國民政府定都南京、始改北平爲市、直隸於行政院、去歲杪冀察政務委員會成立、又轉轄於該會、其在北方政治上文化上交通上之地位、迄未衰替、惜爲外人勢力所包圍、至今已成心腹大患、</p>
<p>北平商業熱鬧中心地、首推前門外王府井大街束安市塲數處、前門外商舖、以資厚牌老勝、所謂「北京老住戶」之購貨、（允共衣料）恒以該處購獲者爲講究、近年世事推移、此輩老住戶大半衰落、前門外之商業、已大呈頽勢、王府井大街、以矞麗堂皇勝、其在平市觀瞻上幾可媲美上海之南京路、東安市塲以小巧玲瓏勝、攤肆夾道、百貨雜陳、誘惑性且較王府井爲甚、故一般顧客、允共摩登男女、多喜出入共間、外國人之來北平觀光者、亦必以市塲巡禮爲必要之遊程、北平人口、國都南遷、曾一度銳减、九一八事變後、又日有增加、迨至去歲、已增至一百五十六萬四午餘人、惟此激增之數、多係東北失業貧民、被人排擠而流入、絕少擁有購買力者、同時外貨利用中國關稅、减低匯兌率、不惜廉價、向我市塲傾銷、故環顧東安市塲、多爲外貨所充斥、允其化裝物小兒玩具日常家用工業品等、苟欲一睹國貨、無異沙中檢金、允駭人聽聞者、該市塲中、有一皮革大衣之少婦、欲選購國貨、事爲在旁逡巡之某國便衣人所偵悉、竟敢當衆辱批其頰、有抱不平者、旋爲左右勸止、如此情勢、今後之北平市塲將全爲外貨所獨覇矣、</p>

<p>— 宜譯</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>一九三五年英國經擠情勢，比起上一年來，顯着好轉了。然而有許多工業部門卻還遠達不到一九二九年（經濟恐慌前）的水準。經濟界有好些方面對於前途的景象，尤其是從國際情勢着眼，不免抱着憂慮。很有勢力的密特蘭銀行（Midland　Bank）出版的月刊宜告着：世界的局勢，正在創造一種惡劣的空氣，於今後經濟的好轉有礙。</p>
<p>商業部所發表的正式的數字顯示着國外貿易以及航業的增進。鋼鐵的出產有着顯著的進步，可以跟近三年來受高關稅保護的重工業對於大改造的要求相應，又可以供給戰爭工業的需要。</p>
<p>就另一方而來說，煤的輸出，在去年七月到九月，比一九三四年同時期跌落了，在十月從三，六三〇，〇〇〇噸（一九三四）跌落到三，二九〇，〇〇〇噸（一九三五）。據新出的「經濟家　所載，製造品的輸出和鐵路的貨運在十一月份跌得很厲害，一部分是由於對意制裁。素來當作英國工業景氣的氣壓表的電力消費指數在去年最後幾月閒顯示着低落，一九三四年十月份的指數是一〇三·一，一九三五年十月份可就跌到九〇·五了。</p>
<p>英國去年底有許多工業部門的工人要求着增加工資，最可注意的是礦業和紡織工業。就前十一個月來說，去年工業上的勞資衝突事件共計五五一决，比一九三四年的四四二决增加了四分之一光景，而加入這些衝突的工人人數則從一一九，〇〇〇到二六七，〇〇〇，增加了一倍以上。</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>一九三五年美國的工業生產全部增加了百分之十，可是還在一九二九年的水準以下百分之三十。一九三五年的農業總收入便是按照官方的字數，也不過七八〇〇〇〇萬美金，比起一九二丸年的一一〇〇〇〇〇萬美金來，相差很遠。</p>
<p>許多日報和什志說到經濟的好轉並不穩定，在一九三六年里也許會發生新的糾紛，影饗到工業的各重要部門。例如國立市銀行公報十二月號就說美國面對著好些不良的經濟因素，一九三六年的工商業說不定會陷於停滯狀態的</p>
<p>美國的失業數字還是很高，據各種調查，至少有一千一百萬，而據哈密爾頓學社的計算，則多到一千三百萬。工資保持着先前的低水準，而食物價格和房租則在一九三五年差不多增加了百分之十。</p>
<p>從一九三五年官方發表的數字看來，政府雖然津貼着縮減耕種地農人，一九三五年卻是大多數農人加深貧乏的一年，每千家中閒為了債務把房產拍賣的有二十一家，為了不付租稅把房產拍賣的在七家以上。南部諸州的佃農據統計的有三十萬家因為削減棉田的緣故，沒有土地可以耕種了。</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>狂熱的戰爭準　和深烈的食品缺乏——在考察一九三五年德國經濟地位的時候最可注目的就是這兩點。</p>
<p>戰爭工業有着極大的發展，但是消費品製造工業的出產卻低落了。</p>
<p>農業的地位不見得怎樣進步。穀類生產額雖比一九三四年高些，但還低於過去的五年的每年平均生產額。山芋的收穫從一九三四年的四，六七〇萬噸，跌到一九三五年的三九五〇萬噸。</p>
<p>畜牧業所受的打擊很深烈，原來德國的外匯準備金大量地運用於戰爭工業原料的輸入，因而飼料的輸入不免減少了。</p>
<p>一九三六年的德國面對着苦痛的財政狀況。國債積到四十萬萬馬克以上。財政部長已經公開宜布過：為了戰爭預算的需要，必須向人民微取「最後的銅子」了。</p>
<p>就國外貿易來說，去年也是法西斯德國不幸的一年。雖然出口貿易跟一九三四年相比還算穩定，（根據着一月到十月的指數）但是進口貿易卻大大地縮減了。</p>
<p>德國法西斯報紙也不免透露出生活程度大增這一個事質來。大商店的廣告指示着物價在一年當中提高了百分之四十到六十。</p>
<p>失業是飛躍地增加了。連那所載的計算應當打個折扣的法西斯報紙也登着失業數字近兩百萬。其實失業人數遠過於道數目。</p>
<p>德國大衆窮困的表徵，最顯著的大的是死亡率的高漲吧。一九三四年的死亡率是每千人一〇·九，而一九三五年則到每千人一三·七了。在幾個大城市，三個月里有着自殺二七一五起的紀錄。單就柏林來說，每天就有五人或六人自殺。</p>
<p>自殺以外，因政治關係而死的也有不少。從國社黨當權以來，被殺的反法西斯主義者共計四八七〇一。反法西斯主義的案件共計五四二五件。的有二萬一千人被判處總計三九七九二年的刑期。如果加上集中營里。各政治犯的監禁期閒去，共計十萬年光景。</p>
<p>意國</p>
<p>去年底的意國對阿比西尼亞戰爭的結果，處在非常緊張的空氣里。意國在軍事前綫和國內都遭逢到極大的困難，道是連牠本國的報紙也不想掩飾的。</p>
<p>意國經過了許多年的不量氣，進行對阿比西尼亞的戰爭，而國際制裁的施行又對意國輸出品關住了許多市塲，經濟危機當然是愈加嚴重了。為要適應戰爭的需要，工業改組了一番，這結果，重工業的生產近幾月來大量增加了。一九三四年七月，機器建設的指數超過一九二九年的水準百分之五，超過一九三四年的水準百分之三六，汽車工業的出產跟一九二九年的數字相比，增加百分之二五。鋼鐵產額也有着顯著的增加，一九三五年前七個月里鐵的產額總計三三六〇〇〇噸，而一九三四年同時期則不過二九九，〇〇〇噸，鋼的產額在同時期也增加了。</p>
<p>在同一時期，那些適應軍事需要的工業部門的出產儘管驚人地增加着，工業生產的　　指數卻在一九三五年的夏季數月顯着大減。在一九三五年七月，跟一九二九年相比，減了百分之十五，跟一九二五年五月相比，減了百分之二十。</p>
<p>這一種跌落由於製造品工業大大的衰落。紡織工業允其受着深烈的打擊。一九三五年七月製絲工業的指數不過是九·五，而一九三四年七月則有五〇·六。（把一九二九年作為百分）大受制裁影響的農業也有相同的情勢。意國輸出的水果有過半數運不出施行制裁的諸國去。葡萄酒的輸出減少了四分之一。戰爭使意國政府不得不把可以支配的貨幣和存金全數動用，在財政上已經發生深烈的影響了。</p>
<p>日本</p>
<p>一九三五年日本國家經濟全體比一九三四年愈加集中起來，迎合所謂『非常時』，—或者可叫做『大戰」的準備的需耍。因此一九三六三七年度的預算又復是純粹的軍事預算，在國家支出總額日金二二七〇〇〇萬元中間，過半數是陸軍海軍兩省的支出連同跟戰爭需要相關的其他九種項目。同時，撥給那被認為形勢危殆的農業的欵項愈加低減了。</p>
<p>因此一九三五年的日本工業顯着片面的繁榮。那些供給着軍需的工業有着進步，而其他的工業部門，允其是那些供給着消費品的，則落後得很。</p>
<p>日本現在遭逢着嚴重的財政難關，日本銀行所藏的未售出的政府公債計有三二〇〇〇萬元的巨額。這引到一九二七年以來最大的通貨膨脹。跟一九三四年底的日金一七六三〇〇萬元相比，目下流通的紙幣，總計超過日金二〇〇〇〇〇萬元了。</p>
<p>伴着這所謂日本的「片面繁榮」的是工人和農人的生活標準的漸減，工資是步步地低落了，而生活費則高漲起來。把一九三四年的工資指數作為百分，那麼一九三五年十月的指數是八一，低於一九三四年十月的八二·六了。同時把一九三四年　售物價指數作為百分，那麼一九三五年十二月是一五五·六，而一九三四年十二月則是一五〇。這些不過是平均的數字，其實大衆消費的物品還漲得厲害。例如食品類價格的指數從一九三四年十二月漲到了上年十二月的二三三，而衣服類則從一四九漲到了一八三。</p>

<h3 id="c75">疾病的發生和預防（上） <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 衛生署技正　金寶善</p>
<p>諸位：我要講的題目，是「疾病的發生和預防」，病是人類的仇敵，也是社會的惡蠢，所以我們有句俗話說：「平安即是福，無病小神仙」然而人類繁殖愈盛，物質文明愈進化，致病的原因愈複雜，人類健康被刦奪的機會也就愈多，越是通都大邑，人類生命越危險。因為交通的便利，飲料食物同一來源，在在都是增加疾病的機會。我們單拿傳染病來說，在數十年前，世界各國幾乎年年都有傳染病的流行，病一經發現，就如同洪水猛獸一般，每年因病而死的人不知多少，社會上因病所受的經濟塌失，自然也是很大。所以我們要想為人類及社會謀幸福，非先設法除絕疾病不可，這是很明顯的。我們要想除絕疾病，自然要明瞭疾病發生的原因，再進而研究預防疾病的方法，然後去加以研究。不然這「病是永遠不能剷除的。</p>
<p>我們今天就先把「疾病的發生」這一個問題，略加討論。</p>
<p>人類的知識漸進，對於疾病的觀念，也就日漸發達。用歷史的眼光來看，從前在新石器時代有鑽開顱骨放鬼出來的傳說，到現在非洲北方的土人中，還有這種舉動。因為他們以為頭痛抽風等等的病狀，都是由於鬼魔在頭內作祟所致的。他們對於疾病，既無理解的能力，自然就會發生恐怖的心理，而引起迷信的觀念。在我們這號稱古文明的大中國，對於疾病死亡，也是以為操諸冥其中主宰者的手中，所以就立廟宇，遵儈道，來希望袪除疾病。如此因循荏苒，經數千百年，直至今日，牠的遺熾，仍舊存在，所以多數的人，對於疾病的發生，還沒有正當的觀念。</p>
<p>到了十八世紀的末葉，漸漸的才有人着手去尋求人類得病的緣由與發病的所在，由剖解尸體，把所發現的變態和生前的病狀對照，應用各種方法，檢騐病人的血液和排洩物。後來巴司德氏（Paster）在十九世紀末葉，積數年的研究經騐，推翻各種謬說，而發現了微菌致病的證據，在醫學史上開一新紀元。人類因此對於疾病的觀念，也就自然而然的改變了。於是方才知道疾病乃是生理的反常，就是因為我們違犯了生理的常律而發生的。</p>
<p>現代醫學還是在幼稚時代，但那陰沉黑暗的時代已算過去。雖然對於許多的病還是不明瞭他們的病源，但是卻已經掙脫了渺茫的玄理的束縛，走入了正當的軌道，已經得到了正當的法則。一由實騐去尋求科學的眞理。根據現代翳藥的知識，我們知道人類的疾病種類繁多，致病的原因也極形複雜。這些病因，普通可分為兩種，一種是由外部向身體發生作用或由外部侵入體內而發生作用的叫作「外因」。還有一種是自初就潛存體內而附着於身體組織的，稱為一內因」。不過要記得同一個病因可以引起種種的疾病，而幾個病因，也可共同使生一種的疾病，現在就把這些病因，一一加以說明，對於疾病的發生，自然就可以明瞭了。</p>
<p>內因：簡單的說一句，致病的內因，就是人體易罹疾病的狀性，所以叉可以稱為疾病的素因。我們各個人對於外界的刺戟所發生的反應，各不相同，譬如酒客，能喝大量的酒而不醉，不慣飲酒的人，偶嗅酒味就神識昏茫。對於疾病也是一樣的。如同在一家之內，發生了某種傳染病，不一定全家的人都要被感染而生病。這就是對於疾病抵抗力有強弱之分，感染性有難易之別。有抵抗力的在醫學上稱為有免疫性，這種免疫性普通可分為天然的和後天的兩種：天然免疫性是因為動物種屬之不同，而對於同一病原體之感染程度有差異，如同人體不感染牛痘之類。後天免疫性是生後始得來的，如同患過了一决天花以後，體內就發生免疫力，可保終身不再染息。或應用人工的方法，使生免疫力，如種牛痘以預防天花之類。此外「體質」對於疾病的發生，也有重要的關係。體質就是個人之形態的及機能的各種情況之總和，我們想得常態的生活——健康——就先要有正常的體質。如果生活的均衡容易消失而轉為病態，那種體質，就稱為虛弱體質。——就是具有疾病素因。體質的強弱，大都和我們的生活環境和個人的行為有直接關係。凡是體內一部分的組織或器官帶有疾病素因，顯呈生理障礙時，就能夠影響到其他的部分，因為體內各臟器間和各系統閒，都有很密切的相互關係。與個人體質最有密切關係的就是內分泌腺的機能。內分泌腺是在分泌某種化寧的物質，直接輸入血液中的臟器，此種物質，稱為刺激素，能調節全身的新陳代謝作用，在各內分泌腺間，亦有相互的聯絡，一腺發生障礙，就能夠影響到別個腺，所以由內分泌腺機能障礙而起的疾病，常甚複雜。「糖尿病」就是內分泌機能反常的一個例。此種病人多數具有此病的素因——就是糖尿病的體質。在醫案中會見有一家叫人，均患此病。同時與個人之生活習慣亦有相當關係。在歐美各國對於此病之患病率，顯有增加之勢，這是糖食分量增多所致的。糖尿病的病原不一，種類頗多，不過普通最常見的就是由於胰腺中的特種內分泌機能發生障碍所致的一種。這病的發生，每能牽累到其他器官和內分泌腺，如大腦垂體，甲狀腺，腎上腺，肝，腎等的機能，牠最顯著的病狀，就是口喝，易餓，尿量增多，而含有多量的糖質，身體起初多屬比較肥胖些的，以後逐漸消瘦，皮膚發癢，所吃的澱粉類和糖類的食物經消化吸收入血後，遂由小便再排出體外，不能供給身體的應用，這就是因為胰腺中的分泌機能障礙，以致影響到糖類和澱粉類新陳代謝作用反常的一種結果。治療方面最要緊的，就是注意攝生，調制飲食，現在雖有一種「胰島素」的特效藥可用，不過到底還是不能夠求其根治。這就是由身體「內因所致的一種疾病。我們現在來討論致病的外因。</p>
<p>外因：凡疾病的發生，由外界刺戟而致的總稱之為外因」。我們由日常的觀察可以見到疾病的發生，和職業風俗習慣以及生活狀態有密切的關係。他如氣候和衣食住等也有相當的關係。其中允以「食」的問題來得切要。因為生物在生活期間內物質和能力的代謝進行不絕，其原動力乃由營養物所取得，所以營養物供給的障礙，能夠危及健康與生命，自不待言。營養障礙或營養缺乏不但是能直接致病還能致弱體質，而誘發其他的疾病。在物理學方面：有種外來的病因，如器械的刺戟一一外傷；溫熱的刺戟，——過冷過熱；氣壓，光綫，電擊等，都能間接或直接致人於病。在化學方面，有局部作用亦有全身作用的種種中毒情形，如強酸，強鹼類毒氣，嗎啡，毒品，砒，燐，鋁………等等，都能夠直接或間接損害人體的健康。此外最重要的致病外因，還噩兩類，一是寄生蟲類，又一是病菌類。一種動物寄生於他種動物之體上或內臟而攝取其營養液以發育繁殖的生物叫作寄生蟲，能致人類於病的寄生蟲，種類很多，在我國最常見的，有痢疾的阿米巴變形蟲，瘧疾原蟲，鈎蟲，住血蟲，　片蟲，蛔蟲，肺蛭蟲，肝蛭蟲，條蟲，致生象皮病的絲蟲，……等等，這種寄生蟲間接藉昆蟲的媒介或直接鑽入皮膚，或藉糞便排出體外，再由食物遞進消化道，直進內臟——居於腸，或伏於肺，或棲於肝，或泳於血，血滋生繁殖攝取人體營養液，破壞血管，或其他組織，產生毒紫，或閉塞管道，而發生種種生理障礙，如此由一人蔓延傳染及於他人，為害社會人羣，至大且鉅。這一類的疾病，因為具有傳染性所以總稱為「傳染病」。在傳染病的病原中，除了上述這些寄生蟲之外，還有兩類細小生物，非肉眼所能看到的，謂之病菌，和濾過性病毒。濾過性病毒，異常細小，能夠濾過濾　，沒有形態之可言。至病菌就可根據牠的形態而分為三大類，通常在顯微鏡下見之，如球形的，謂之球菌，桿形的稱為桿菌，螺旋形的稱為螺旋菌。每一種的濾過性病毒或細菌都能致生一種病症。所以牠們的病因作用視其種類而各不相同，有的能直接破壞組鐵，有的能產生毒素，在菌體內的稱為菌內毒素，還有的能產生菌外毒素，藉血液而散佈全身，毒害身體組織。傳染的方法，最顯著的就是直接和患者接觸所致的傳染叫作直接傳染或接觸傳染，由附粘於其他器物或人之身上然後傳染到他人的，叫作閒接傳染；有的則是由昆蟲食物或水的煤介而傳染的。除此以外還有一種傳染方式，最宜注意的，就是帶菌人與排菌者的問題。一個帶菌人在外觀上似屬健康而體內確帶有病菌，能隨時排洩體外，使他人感染致病。排菌者就是自己患了某種傳染病後，始終還在排洩病菌，這兩種人都容易為人所忽略，所以危險性極大。現在再舉幾種最普通的傳染病例以昭示其侵人人體的途徑；（一）由口腔侵入的，如盡亂，痢疾，傷寒；（二）由鼻咽喉侵入的，如白喉，猩紅熱；（三）由皮膚破傷處侵入的，如破傷風，丹毒。（四）由呼吸器官侵入的，如肺癆，肺炎，流行性感胃。但是我們應當明瞭的就是病菌侵入了人體之後，不一定就會發生傳染病，因為疾病發生，乃是表示我們身體保衛力屈服於侵襲病菌的一個結果。所以一種傳染病，都要依照一定的「要件」，才能夠發生。這些要件，就是：一，身體健康消失或減低到一定的程度；二，體內的免疫力薄弱；三，病菌的侵襲力強；四，病菌的毒性有一定的強度；五，侵襲病菌的數目，已達起病所需要的最低限度；六，病菌所侵入的部位，對於該菌的發育適宜，所以能迅速的繁殖。例如肺癆病是由癆病桿菌從身體外部侵入人體所發生的一種傳染病，在我們這不講求衛生的環境中，和這病菌接觸的機會着實是不少，可是我們並不是每决接觸或所有接觸的人都一定要發生肺癆病，因為情形不符合上述諸「要件」的。就不發生此病。反面說來：假使一個人生來已具有癆病體質，或因生活違背了天然原則，使身體健康減低，體內的抵抗力薄弱，同時那病菌的侵襲力強，毒性又烈，那末等到集合於肺部的病菌數目增加到相當的數量時，便就即刻暴發，着手破壞肺臟組織而起結核性的病理變化，毒害全身，以致精神不振，常覺疲倦，食慾減少，盜汗咳嗽，午後發熱，痰中帶血或咯血，身體消瘦………等等症狀。總之凡是疾病不論是吾傳染病都要由前面所述那些內外兩因的互相呼應，才能發生疾病的現象。這就是疾　發生的梗概，至於防病的方法如何，下次再繼續討論吧。</p>

<p>下午三時起在申園優游西捕作甲組賽</p>
<p>本季西聯足球、自開賽以來、頻遭雨阻、昨日字林盃三場及聯賽六場、又因前晚大雪、場地潮濕、改期比賽、今日原定節目中、重要者有史考托盃東華與西商之爭奪决賽權、及字林盃第三週衛生對臘克斯之决複賽、另聯賽甲丙各一組戊三組、共計九場交鋒、秩序如下、</p>
<p>東華對西商</p>
<p>今日各塲比賽以史考托盃東華對西商之複賽、最爲重要、在申國舉行、西商平庸無能、觀其在本季聯賽中、出塲六决、僅二勝一和、賽力已可想見、則今日東華之獲勝、萄牙隊舉行决賽、惟東華對史盃前途、倘今日克西商隊、尙須再勝一次、方可蟬聯冠軍、東華今日將以新近恢復球籍之陸鍾恩出任守門、鍾恩自恢復資格後，尙屬首决出戰、全隊陣容如下、</p>
<p>優游對西捕</p>
<p>優游本季在甲組中戰蹟、三戰三勝、從未敗北、今日出戰西捕、作甲組賽於膠州公園、西捕在本季中出戰六場、計負四次、當難對付優游隊之勝利自可預下、　惟優游今日出戰與否、據該會負責人稱、須臨時方可決定、大的因場地關係、至出場陣容、已定如下、</p>

<p>麥令對協興　麥令對協興作甲甲賽、回憶西青會中、該兩隊會經一度會師、恊興以一球之先、將其擊敗、昨夕兩隊狹路二决相逢、麥令全軍具懐報復之志、破釜沉舟、迎頭猛攻、致協興諸將、措手不及、被强生勃利士墨飛等、橫衝直撞、睥睨一時、分數扶搖直上、上半時完畢、麥令三四、協興十分、再戰聲中、協興戰士、仍形氣餒、攻旣無孔可入、守亦漏洞屢見、局勢依然難於展開、相持至最後五分時、徐亨周達云略有建樹、但當初損失過巨、在瀾旣倒、殊無挽救、遂以廿一對六八大敗而歸、兩隊成績列左、</p>

<p>— 童子們中，除了拂朗和受彌以外，都不知道這件事的經過，等到第二天早上跑下去的時候，他們眞是大吃一驚而且感覺得極度不安，因為那大宅裏不見了它的主人和主母便覺孤凄寂寞，早餐沒有了高高興興的蜀夫人在總持分茶的職務，竟是一頓無聊齋的餐敘，等到上課的時間一到，裴伯伯的坐位也是空空的。他們徬徨失措無以自慰的約一小時之久，等著新聞，希望小橋的父親能不發生危險，因為好人喬恩白魯客是很為童子們所心愛的。十點鐘已經到了，仍舊沒有人來減紓他們的疑擾。他們不想遊戲，然而時間過云得殊沈滯，他們坐立不安，總覺無聊，而且嚴重。忽然拂朗立著，并且以他那種常能動人的言詞說道：　　「呀，有法子了，孩子們！讓我們進課室去，一樣做我們的功課，彷彿伯伯還是在這裏一般。這樣，時候可以過去得快些，而且我知道也可以使他暢快些的。」　　「可是誰來聽我們念書呢？」解客問道，　　「我來，雖然我所知道的和你們的相比，原也不能富足了多少，可是我在這裏年紀最大假如你們不在意，當他沒有回來之前，我姑且試試為他代理一下，」</p>

<p>申報兒童專刋　　申報兒童志願徵文我將來做怎樣的人  工部局荊州路小學唐文彪　　我將來做怎樣的人？政治家嗎？科學家嗎？都不是，因爲我將來不一定能夠做到這樣偉大的人物。所以我希望將來做一個從事敎育的人，對於國家要有些小的貢獻，才能盡國民一份子的責任。　　中國現在已處在危急萬分的當兒，前有豺豹，後有虎狼，同胞們！真情抵抗吧！起來抵抗侵略我們的敵人吧！唉！爲甚麼不抵抗？因爲沒有堅强的勇氣，何以沒有堅强的勇氣？最大的原因，便是人民沒有知識。因爲有了知識，才能激發勇氣去抵抗，所以一般沒有知識的民衆，只知道自私自利，只顧自己發財，做了富人便算罷了。　　國家有甚麼災禍，他們不盡絲毫的力量，幫助國家，他們以爲不是自己的事，然而。國破則家亡！國亡了，那裏還有家呢？就算你是個大富翁，也不過是個亡國奴罷了！　　所以我將來，要替國家辦敎育，開設平民學校，指導一般沒有知識的同胞，使他們都有受敎育的機會；並激發他們的勇氣去爲國效力，爲國民謀幸福，這樣，我想我對於國家，至少是能夠有些貢獻的。武訓先生  雨人　　小朋友們！在一百年以前，臨淸地方，有一位奇怪的乞丐，口口聲聲呌著「義學」，人家侮辱他，他不管，好容易討得了飯，他不吃，把討來的飯，賣給人家，自己却和街上的狗爭一些人家零星的殘湯和臭飯，有人笑他，他說：「吃得好，不算好，修個義學才算好。」人家給他一些水喝，他把水洗了臉，然後再喝下肚去，口裏却唱著：「喝髒水，不算髒，不修義學才算髒。」　　這個乞丐，不管人家討厭，碰着人，總拉牢人家向人家要錢，有了錢，却不化費，把它積蓄起來，一有機會，便替別人做苦工，做得了錢，却把它儲起來。只要有人給他錢，甚至他可以跑下來的。　　這樣，他的錢便慢慢多下來，別人都呌他「義學症」，他却說：「義學症，不算症，有錢不修義學，才是大過人。」等到，他的義學成功了，他又去請敎師，一切錢，都是他得來的，對於學生，他偏偏選沒有錢的人家的子弟，如果誰不用功了，他起先是勸，假使勸還是沒有用，他便仍是用最笨的一個方法，跑在學生前面。你想，學生那有不感動的嗎？　　可是這位偉大人格的乞丐，就在五十九歲那年，死在臨淸義學裏面，他死的時候，還再三叮囑後來的人繼續辦義學。這位偉大人格的乞丐，就是武訓先生。他的一生，好像專爲着「義學」似的！　　小朋友！你唸了上面的故事，有什麼感想？一個乞丐，他居然犧牲自己，而多少貧困的子弟却受到他的好處了。時鐘  鐵吾　　　　　叮噹！叮噹！　　一點，叮噹！　　兩點，叮噹！　　敲白了多少人的頭髪，　　敲逝了多少寳貴的時光，　　叮噹依舊是從前的叮噹。　　小朋友　　這是警勵我們的好朋友，　　呼喝我們的當頭棒，　　我們該換一種聽法：　　「向上」！「向上」！　　使我們的知識—充實，　　使我們的身體—健强，　　「向上」！「向上」！　　莫辜負了叮噹！　　莫虛度了時光！花朶染色  吳瑞蓀　　諸位小朋友！我找到一種新的玩藝，名呌『花朶染色』；諸位一定要驚疑，花朶怎樣的染色呢？但是簡而易行的事實卻在證明。　　我們把一朶藍色的花，侵入一杯石灰水內，那藍色的花立刻變綠色了。我們再把一朶花，浸入一杯含有幾滴酸的水中（硫酸磷酸都可），它就會變成紅色。　　把浸過酸液而變紅的花，再浸入石灰水中，仍能變綠色，同未浸酸液一樣，如此循環變色，永無止息，興趣無窮，諸位不妨試試。十個朋友  汪敏　　我有十個永遠不和我離開，永遠聽我使喚，永遠帮助我做事的朋友，他們是：　　第一朋友呌腦筋，他的別名呌腦海，面孔圓圓的，是我那十個朋友中的領袖。當替我發施號令，呌其它幾個朋友替我做事。他又很有記性，我讀過的書，做過的事，聽人說過的至理名言，都是呌他替我一一記牢，幷且他還能帮助我思想。　　和腦筋一樣的朋友，呌心房，他很活潑，一天到晚，只愛運動。他是我那十個朋友中的第二個朋友，他帮助我的能力，也不下於腦筋。　　我那第三第四兩朋友，是孿生兄弟，一個呌雙手，一個呌雙足，他們每人都有十個小朋友，小朋友帮着他們，他們帮着我，雙手替我寫字，翻書，做工，雙脚只是引導我到各處走來走去，一天到晚，他們爲我服務。　　第五個朋友眼睛，我有了他才能看見世界上一切事物，和認識字。第六個朋友呌耳朶，我有了他才能聽得到別人的說話，先生們敎我的書句。第七個朋友呌鼻管，我有了他才能嗅得出那東西的好壞。第八個朋友呌舌頭，我有了他才能辯得出食物的滋味。第九個朋友呌牙齒，我有了他才能嚼碎那些硬性的食物，免得吃下肚去，有碍衛生。　　嘴吧，他是我那第十個朋友，他能替我說話，讀書，帮助我的能力，尤其不小。　　這十個朋友，是我挺親愛的朋友，但是，也得由我呌他們替我做正經事才對。若使我自己要做歹事，他們也肯替我服務。這關鍵，我是十分持重的。　　小朋友，你們也有這十個朋友麼？我希望你們，要永遠呌他們替你做正經事，帮助你的事業成功！牛鼻子  黃堯　　牛鼻子吃栗子栗子香双手搶栗子小双手搖栗子甜甜得舌頭舐嘴皮栗子還在鍋中炒鼻子喉嚨　　　栗子爆爆痛鼻子哇哇叫噴火的山  榕　　　　　小明指着那隻配着火山相片的鏡架問道：「我們住的地球，上面有沒有火山。會不會噴火的？」　　他的哥哥勇兒回答道：「我們住的地球上，有許多的火山，它會噴火的，噴射的力非常猛烈。噴的時候火山四周有岩漿和水蒸氣，同時，它很猛烈的噴出來，并且其中又夾着石子石屑，那時候，火山四周環繞黑與白色的濃烟，這便是水蒸氣，石子和石屑。」　　小明接着又問道：「火山旣然會噴火，噴過以後，附近村落有什麼災害？」　　勇兒嘆了一口氣說道：「唉，眞可憐哪，附近一帶村落，財產，建築物，人類，都築於那沸騰的石漿之下，在某一年，日本國都東京，發生一次很猛烈的喃發，建築物等都早被它毀壞了，總計損失有幾萬萬元。」　　「那一國中能够看见火山，最著名呌什么名字。」　　「在现在世界中，日本和意大利两国都能够看見，世界中最著名的火山，也當然在意大利和日本兩國之間，在日本國的有最著名的富士火山，意大利也有世界著名的維蘇威火山。」　　「除我們住的地球以外，別的附近尾球，有沒有那可怕的火山？」　　「別的星球正多著哩，如月球上面，它的火山更大。」　　「勇哥，火山噴發是否激動地震的」。　　「是啊，火山噴發，激動地震的有三種，　陷落地震；就是地面經過車子和很重的東西走過，地面漸漸的緊，但是內部仍空虛，偶一震動，猶要陷落。　火山地震，當火山噴發時，是非常的猛烈，所以附近一帶就因激動而地震。　斷層地震，就是地球內部有很大的岩石，岩石經久疏鬆之後，兩面裂開發生斷層地震了。」　　在那時，小明對他所問的題目，心中已很明瞭了，手中的甜糕，香餅，也已吃完，就去睡覺了。本報「兒童志愿徵文」得獎諸君注意  寄萍　　　　　諸位小朋友：我吿訴你一個好消息，就是本報去年徴求「兒童志愿文」的事，現在手續完全辦妥了。你們應得的獎學金及紀念品，已由本館先後匯寄，大概這兩天都可寄到了。你們收到後，不必寫回信，若是收不到呢，可以來信查問。諸位小朋友：你們得了獎學金，應該刻苦用功，使學業猛進出口得了紀念品，就得善爲應用，增進讀書的興趣；得到贈報的應從今日起，養成讀「申報」的習慣俗語說得好：「秀才不出門，能知天下事。所以「申報」是不能不讀的。總之申報獎勵讀者諸君，而讀者必頻愛護「申報」；雙方永遠地取合作的態度就是了。下面便是本報發出的獎金及獎品：　　第一獎　現金五十元（一名）　　第二獎　現金三十元（二名）　　第三獎　現金二十元（五名）　　第四將　現金十元（十名）　　第五獎　贈文具（二十名）　　國權牌自來水筆一枝　　美　記事簿　六冊　　第六獎　贈玩具（三十名）　　立體積木建築遊戲一盒　　軍事遊戲　一盒　　升學遊戲　一盒　　第七獎贈本報一月（五十名）　　以上現金及贈報，均由本館匯寄，文見玩具均託中華書局掛號寄得奬者所肄業之學校，轉交本人收領。五種小發明  文蕙　　一、鐵鍫　鐵鍫做成上面的樣子，就是細沙泥也能翻轉來了。　　二、火柴盒　火柴盒上的摩擦粉，改塗在勹，攵兩面，擦火的時候，沒有風時用勹面有風用攵面。　　三、鉛絲旋　用鉛絲旋掛肥皂，可以省掉肥皂盒。　　四、筆筒　如圖在筆筒內裝一塊鉛紗，可免掉積留灰塵。　　五、魚叉　魚叉的尖頭，做成回形鉤式，可使叉住的魚，不會再逃脫。兒童園地可敬的惠華  李小岑　　可怕的西北風，呼呼地吹着。大雪紛紛地飄着。路上的行人很稀少，路旁的樹給風吹得發出瑟瑟的聲音，怪可怕的。在路旁的破房子裏，住着母子兩個。子名惠華，它的主人翁—父親，早就去世。他們的生活，全靠他母親紡織度日。有時他們連飯也吃不飽。　　一天，他的母親忽然生起病來了。一個破碎的家庭，那裏還能夠生病呢？因着飢寒之迫，他母親的病愈加重了。這怎麼辦呢？他們也沒有錢請醫生。他母親天天呻吟着。伊的聲音，直刺人惠華的耳中，實在使他難過萬分。後來，他只好向母親吿別說：「我想出去替人家做工，賺得些錢來請醫生。」說罷他就走了。　　他一直向前面走去，看見一所很精美的房子。惠華便走進去，請求主人給他做一些事。那主人覺得也很可愛，便答應了。他便勤勤懇懇地在那兒做了三天的工，賺得了一點錢。於量他立刻回家，替母親請醫生看病。醫生說：「這病隔幾天就會得好的，你們不要着急。」惠華才放了心。不久，他母親的病固然漸漸地好了。啊！惠華！他是多麼的可敬呀！世界萬花筒  仁　　『千湖之國』—芬蘭　　　芬蘭的國旗　　芬蘭的地形　　　芬蘭的森林　　芬蘭的市集日　　　芬蘭的女孩　　芬蘭的男孩　　年輕的國家　芬蘭本來屬於瑞典，經過了七百年。一八〇九年改歸俄國，一九一七年十二月，乘着蘇聯歷內發生革命宣布獨立，成爲共和國，到了現在，還不過十九年，所以可以算是年輕的共和國。　　十字形國旗　芬蘭的國旗，是很容易認識的，白底子，一個淡藍色的十字，（圖一）。　　地形像女人，芬蘭界在歐洲的北部，波羅的海的東岸，它的東面鄰舍是蘇聯；西面鄰舍是瑞典和波的尼亞灣；北面鄰舍是挪威。它的地形，很像一個戴白帽子的天主敎女人。（圖二）　　千湖的國家　芬蘭全國多湖泊，它們的數目眞是數也數不清楚，所以有『千湖之國』的名稱。　　一半是森林　芬蘭全國，森林占全面積二分之一，用這些木材做紙頭，賣到外國的很多，這造紙和木材生意是芬蘭人的主要的收入，（圖三）　　亮眼瞎子少　芬蘭人，十分之九是黃種。民性剛强堅忍，有百折不回的精神，敎育普及，一九二四年，他們試騐全國十五歲的兒童，一千個兒童當中，只有七個不識字。我們看了圖五，和圖六，便可以知道芬蘭的女孩和男孩是什麼樣式的。義狗傳（六）  心靑　　至於柏德希呢，它覺得遇着這樣的生活已好似在天堂上了。它先前在舊主人那裏，總是被迫着拖那重得可怕的車兒，步步被鞭子抽打着，而如今却好像玩耍似的拖着這一輛又小又輕的綠色的車兒，裝着些光亮的銅罐兒，在那柔和的老人身旁走去，時時覺得他那溫柔的撫摩，聽得他那溫柔的聲音，況且它的工作每天只需三四個鐘點，以後它便可自由在，要怎樣便怎樣——展開了脚，睡在陽光中，到田野中去散步，和小主人跳着玩着，或是和那些狗朋友互相追逐着。柏德希是快樂極了。　　最使它安慰的，便是它的舊主人喝醉了酒，在梅克林地方和人打架，被人打死了。再也不會打擾它，儘可由它安安樂樂地過它的生活。　　老達士本來是一個殘廢的人，過了幾年，已癱瘓得行動不得，從此不能同着柏德出去送牛乳了。好在小南洛如今已是一個六歲的孩子，只爲平日常常跟着他的老祖父一同出去，對於鎭中各處已熟悉，他就代替了老達士在車旁一路走去，一路出賣那些牛乳，得到了錢，帶回去分頭交與牛乳的主人，很鄭重又很有禮貌，大家都喜歡他。　　小南洛原是一個美貌的孩子，一隻溫柔的漆黑的眼睛，他的臉上紅噴噴地好似開着一朶好花，一股股的美髪，聚在他的咽喉旁邊，有好多的畫師瞧見了他總得將他的車兒，狗兒一起寫生——一輛綠色的車兒裝着銅質的牛乳罐，一頭黃色的大狗，轡帶上裝着鈴子，一面走，一面琅琅地作響，它的旁邊便是那小小的孩子，一雙白白的小脚穿着挺大的木靴，一張天眞爛漫的很快樂的臉，活像羅本氏名畫中的小天使。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊時事研究英法接近與歐洲形勢的新發展  海波　　大英帝國，在表面上雖然還維持着它向來在世界上的優越地位，但實際上它的國勢是在日益下降的。首先，在世界上它就到處遇到了美國的進攻；金元王國的勢力攻進了加拿大，澳洲，南洋等地，英國許多殖民地的經濟支配權大有被奪去的危險。其次，是日本勢力在遠東的發展，對英國已有了很大的而且是現實的威脅。本來當「九一八」事件發生時美國對日本就採取很積極的態度，要求英國合作對日，但那時唐寗街還未感到切身的威脅，而且還別有懷抱，所以英人竟自拒絕了美國的要求，縱容日本在遠東的行動；及至最近，由於日本勢力的更進一步的發展，侵犯到了英國在華的權利，於是倫敦才表示願與華盛頓合作對日，但金元王國却反而又抱着不管態度，這更是使英人大感不安；最近鮑爾溫內閣雖然在努力加強新加坡軍港，鞏固遠東防務，但在遠東方面如果沒有別的強大國家（美國或蘇聯）的合作，單只英國是不能對付日本的。第三，便是意大利的向阿比西尼亞進攻，使英國在菲洲，在地中海和紅海，乃至在印度的地位都受到了很嚴重的威脅。因此，不列顚帝國為要把它自己從危險的境地中解救出來，為要重振它的威力，便不得不在歐洲，在世界上找求有力的援助。這結果是使唐寗街不得不考慮放棄向來的抑制法國的態度，而實行要求巴黎的合作了。同時，法國因為希特勒的重整軍備，畏懼德國的復仇，當然也願意和英國携手的。所以，在經過倫敦和巴黎的外交家的長久的努力，多决的談判後，英法的海陸空軍合作終於成為了事實了。　　在英法海陸空軍合作的辦法中，有這幾點：「一，英國得利用法國海軍根據地及船廠與工廠，二，法國陸軍徵集最近兩年之徵兵，三，法國空軍之信號設備可供英國航空部之利用，俾遇有敵機將來攻擊時發出警告」；同時，更明白規定着：「如兩國中任何一國被他國攻擊，其他一國即將以全力合作」，「不論英國艦隊在地中海受海軍攻擊，或法國鄰近德奧意三國之邊境受陸軍攻擊」，英法均合作對付。這樣的海陸空軍合作，其目的自然不只是在對意，而且是在防德。所以，當英法海陸空軍合作的消息傳出後，不僅羅馬方面非常注意，即希特勒也為之惶恐而向倫敦要求了解釋。　　當意阿戰爭還未爆發時，特別是當英法海陸空軍合作尚未成功時，在歐洲還是一種英國助德制法，法國拉意防德的局面。但自英法海陸空軍合作成立後，意火利和德國同時都感到了孤立的危險，因而向來在奧國問題上有着不可調和的衝突的德意兩國也有了親近的傳說。據最近傳出的消息，說德國願意幫助慕索里尼遠征柬非，同時意國也可不過問奧大利問題，讓德奧合併成為現實：這雖未為羅馬和柏林方面承認，但就目前形勢看來，德意親近確是大有可能的。如果英法能進一步地合作，德意也隨着眞的結合起來，那歐洲形勢便可說又恢復了第一决大戰前的舊觀。即是一方面是英法俄的集團，另一方面則是德意的勢力：所不同者，只是因為在戰後奧匈帝國瓦解了，不能形成德奧意的同盟國集團和英法俄的恊約國集團的對立形勢：但在另一方面，日德同盟的傳說現正高唱入雲，波蘭更是和德國打得火熱，因之世界兩大勢力的對立形勢仍在逐漸形成，大戰的陣綫也漸决有了大概的劃分。　　最近，因為英王喬治逝世，各國政治家乘參加奉安典禮之便，更在倫敦積極活動。就中特別植得注意的是蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫與英政府要人的往還。李氏在倫敦曾與鮑爾溫艾登乃至英國新王愛德華八世談論到歐洲和遠束問題，就形勢看來，英俄的關係已表現出了比過去較為接近。事實上，英國為要對付意大利，特別是為要在遠東對付日本，確有拉攏蘇聯以自固的必要，至於蘇聯，當然也願意結合英法以抗日德的，所以，在法國的撮合之下，英蘇的舊惡不僅可以暫時掃除，而且還有更進一步合作的可能。　　雖然法國內閣最近有所變更，但新的薩勞內閣在外交上不僅未曾改變前賴伐爾內閣的原則，而且還更為積極。薩勞內閣在實布大政方針的宣言書中，關於外交政策的說明是：「一，遵守國際條的所明定之的束，以維持和平。二，按照國聯會之原則，以發展集體安全制度。是故在國聯會庇蔭之下，與在友好諒解精神之內，凡足以使意阿爭端便利且迅速解决，使人類慘殺之敵對行動迅速終止者，本政府定將竭共全力以贊共成。吾人與各國之間輯睦邦交，不論其為比國小協商諸國意大利波蘭蘇俄或英國，其唯一目的，為在國聯會範圍之內維持和平，並組織和平制度，固不欲藉此以自圖利益：至於英國，若與法國和衷共濟，則允為歐洲和平主要保障也。」由此看來，薩勞內閣在外交上不僅繼承了近年來法國的傳統政策，而且還有更進一步的表現，這便是特別進行親英政策。事實上，現任法國外長佛蘭亭向來就是主張親英的。這樣，英法的更進一步合作，從而更經過法國而使英俄携手，結成英法俄的集團力量，在客觀形勢的發展中便有了更多的可能。　　不過，目前英法雖在接近，但還不能說它們乃至它們和蘇聯的集團力量已經完全組成：因為法國目前所企圖的，主要地還是在實現集體防德的計劃，觀乎薩勞內閣的一面高唱集體安全制，一面又不忘情於意國，以及最近法國的策動英法意的地中海公約，便可表現出巴黎的主要企圖了；同時，英國所懷抱的，主要地也只是在利用集體力量使意大利和日本適可而止，不侵犯到它的利益，此外如實現中東歐的集體安全制度，非到萬不得已時，也絕不是現在的保守黨內閣所願意幹的。所以，我們在上面所指出的那些，只是由英法接近所引起的世界形勢發展的新趨勢，並不是已成的事實。現在，各國政治領袖正雲集巴黎，商討中束歐的問題，特別是新近的奧國復辟問題，這結果對於歐洲形勢當然是有很大關係的：同時，東菲和遠東局勢正在非常發展中，它的變化情形更是能給歐洲和世界形勢以莫大的影饗。留心時勢的人，請特別注意從各方而發生出來的新的事變吧。哲學講座功利主義  敬和　　　　功利主義雖然是一個不好聽的哲學名詞，而且成為一種流俗的駡人的徽號，但在哲學上說來，縱然一切功利論的哲學並不算什麼正確的哲學思想，卻也並不比所謂理性論或純理想主義更　些</p>

<p>。因為它即使不算什麼正確的唯物諭的哲學，可是它總算是比較接近於唯物論些。　　在一切觀念論者，基於他們的觀念論的立塲，是把求知與精神的滿足圈在內心的冥想圈內，在於去證悟那原不存在的先天觀念和生來即為神所付予的理性及其法則，乃至那空中樓閣的宇宙精神，而拒絕從外的現實世界，眞實存在的物質生活上去求滿足的。他們更不相信現實世界之物質的本體和現象的眞實性，所以拒絕去研究和認識它。他們也不相信科學，不相信科學能夠發現眞理，認識外物，因為他們認外物是不可知的。當然他們更不相信依據科學的法則，能夠去發展物質的現實生活和認識世界。至於功利主義呢？它的基本觀點是和上述的觀念論相反的，它主張着人類的現實生活上的快樂之滿足，它是快樂主義的哲學思想。在這一點上，它是不和現實的自然與社會相隔絕的，是要追求物質生活的改進的。功利主義者因承認現實的物質生活之滿足和改進的必要，故在某種限度內，它也與觀念論的絕對眞理觀的主張不同。它把是非善惡的標準建立在人的快樂之能吾獲得上，然而人的快樂則是隨着社會的改良和物質生活的進步而改變的，那麼是非善惡只是比較的變化的東西，像觀念論者所幻想的絕對不變的永恒的善惡興眞理，應該在這裹被驅逐出去。功利主義為了要貫澈其現實生活和快樂的滿足，則其相信科學的效能是當然的，只有相信科學所發現的法則，相信這法則和物質世界的眞實性，然後我們人類才能利用科學與自然的物質去發展我們生活，滿足我們的快樂。我們的快樂是現實的和物質的，吾認了物質的現實性，不從科學的法則之利用上去和自然相鬥爭，不利用物質和自然來發展我們的生活，則這快樂的滿足就沒有可能，這還能說什麼人類的功利之追求呢？所有這些，它都和實證主義與實用主義的哲學某程度地相似。因為實證主義者是把眞理與知識建立在實踐的科學的證騐上，而實用主義者則認眞理和知識的價值應該以人類的利益效能為標準，合於實用的就是好的，不合於實用的就是壤的。　　從這樣看來，功利主義的哲學是比較接近於唯物論的，所以許多觀念論哲學家常駡唯物論為功利主義者，這不是沒有原因前。至於這些觀念諭者對於眞正的正確的唯物論之缺乏認識，則這又是另一問題。功利主義的哲學，雖然直到十九世紀才由邊沁及彌爾諸人顯明地形成為一種學派，但它在歷史上早興某些唯物論者的學說有關係。比如伊壁鳩魯原是唯物論者，但他就公然地主張以人類的幸福和快樂為究竟的目的。英國的唯物論者霍布士也主張以人類的現實利益為依歸，所以亦同樣被人稱為功利主義者。至於邊沁是主張最大多數之最大幸福的，彌爾則為經騐論的歸納學派的學者，並側重於社會的改良運動。從歷史的發展過程去看功利論的變遷，它也是在不同的時代有不同的學說內容的。伊壁鳩魯雖主張以快樂為至高之善，但卻又蔑視一切積極的快樂，認為只有平淡心境，限制衝動，才是眞的快樂，這就帶有禁慾主義的色彩。這乃是由於他所處的時代已是希臘的商業資本主義衰落的時代。那時的自然科學，它不能把商業資本主義推向更高階段的發展，推進到近代的資本主義生產，以滿足物質的生活，而希臘的奴隸經濟之向上的繁榮亦已無可能，貴族們則日趨於奢侈淫逸和破敗，所以他的學說一方面由於反對貴族的貧鄙奢侈生活，而具有憤世嫉俗的色彩，以此成為具有若干革命性的唯物論。但另一方面則因不能積極地去改進物質生活，遂不能不帶禁慾主義的色彩。在十七世紀初的英國，是產業最先發展的國家，資本主義已開始在那裏具有進步的勢力，物質生活的改進，人類現實生活上的利益之追求，不但成為可能，而且是已開始向前發展了。所以霍布士即代表這一傾向而形成他的急烈的唯物論哲學，帶着以現實的人類和社會生活之利益為依歸的功利主義色彩。當然，霍布士是英國當時一部分急進的貴族和正傾向於資產階級化而能和新興的資產階級相妥恊的貴族的代言人，所以他仍是開明的君權的擁護者。至於在十九世紀，正是世界的資本主義發展的黃金時代，物質生產的猛進，科學萬能，人類的生活之空前的提高，這些都充分地說明人類的現實生活之快樂與滿足的追求是完全可能的。所以如邊沁，彌爾一派的功利主義學說便顯明地成為獨立的具體的學派了。不過這時的資產階級所認識的最大多數並不是人類的全體，在最大多數中明明有他們所認可的少數的犧牲者，這就是在時代落伍了的貴族和新生長起來但還未具有充分的力量的無產者，因此這種功利主義是主張的當時資產階級的最大多數人的利益的學說。　　功利主義的哲學，雖因為它相信物質生活之改進的可能，並以此為追求的目標；因為它信賴科學及其所發現的事物與法則，而主張利用它來現實人類的幸福與利益，追求人類的快樂，遂某程度地接近了唯物論的宇宙觀與人生觀。但是，這並不能說功利主義就等於正確的唯物主義。因為照功利主義說來，它對於快樂與痛苦的理解，只是分析了它的本身，好像把它當作一種自然的人性去研究一樣。因此當它解决這間題時，也只在於想抑制某些慾望而又發展某些慾望，所以他們中間或則趨於禁慾主義者，或則也僅只從外面加以政治法律之強制的壓抑，而不及於這些東西的發生之社會的根源，亦不從社會的和經濟的制度之改造上去消滅人的痛苦，滿足人的快樂。照這樣的邏輯，人類的不幸福是與物質的和社會的生活無關的，而政治法律的設施也不原於社會的客觀經濟制度的變革，只在於人類某些慾望之當抑制或發展的心理要求所誘引，這是重新回到以心理的慾望指導世界的發展的觀念論的舊巢穴裹去了，與新唯物論所認識的社會的實際生活决定人的意識，解决這些心理上的問題，耍從社會的經濟制度之變革上着手的主張是相背馳的。不但如此，功利主義者所追求的人的利益和快樂，或則只是個人的快樂，或者僅屬于最·多數的一個社會階層的快樂，而不是人類全體的幸福。新唯物論則不然，它要消滅全人類的一切不平，實現全人類的利益與幸福。它也相信科學，主張努力發達科學，以此去認識世界，征服自然，發展人類的現實的物質生活。但它却要以這種努力的成果歸之於全人類，反對科學為部分人服務，反對只提高部分人的物質生活，而把別一部分人打入十八層地獄以下去過生活。如此看來，新唯物論雖同樣是主張人類的現實的物質生活上的利益的，但它卻不是以功利的追求之慾望去指導世界，並旦它所主張的利益與幸福都是全人類的，不是個人的和一個社會層的，所以人們常駡它是功利主義者，這只是一種不懂得它的內容的侮蔑。雜文三月三  照　　白天，三層擱樓里還是烏黑的。裏面擠動着三四個人頭。　　「作孽的，害我活了一把年紀的人，還要鑽在這地獄樣的牢獄里。我早說過，我死也死在家鄉，家鄉死鬼也都認識的！你們一定要上海上海的，我早知道上海沒有好處的！」這是婆婆的聲音。　　立凡不回答她，自個兒嘆了口氣，隨手扭開了電燈。五支燭光的電燈顫動着紅的光。方形的擱桐，頂在人頭上，枯焦的，烏黑的。地板上舖着三條棉被，婆婆屈着膝盤坐在被面上，臉皮是縐得使人見了可怕。還有妻，還有弟。　　立凡把笨重的棉袍卸下來，換上了一件單薄的舊西服。他從三月三日的夜晚，穿着這件棉袍，帶着妻弟和母親，從亂彈穿梭的地面上奔逃出來。那時天氣還寒冷，現在這舊棉袍還裹着人體，顯然是太不合適。每在正午時候，立凡的身上時常感到觸膚的奇癢。　　春風，寒峭的，雖然也似溫暖的。立凡的單薄西服，在這天氣中實在太不相稱。他踱到街心，看見人家都是穿的淡灰色的夾大衣，蓋及膝頭。　　他噓了一口氣，擦擦手背。轉過辣斐德路，公共汽車和電車中都擠滿了人。公共汽車像靑蛙般在他面前伏下了，一個苗條得像一根蛇的女人輕鬆地溜上了汽車之後，一個少年紳士也溜上了。立凡摸摸口袋，羞法她，再向前走了一步，耳鼓上聽得拍的一聲，接着車嗚嗚嗚的跑走了。　　他自己想：走走吧，天氣怪好的。　　法國梧桐在稻草包縛的枝條上生出綠芽，是春天了。走過成都路，他想起了他的朋友雷君。雷君租的是三陽里八弄某號三樓。他這麼想，就拐進了三陽里。　　「好，立凡，你來啦，我正想來找你。悶在這陋室中，遲早會生病的。」　　立凡嘆了口氣，坐下。電君的夫人倒了杯茶，立凡　了一口。　　「雷，幾天來可有消息嗎？」　　「那來消息？還不是報紙上有的嗎？也不見得可靠。」　　「咱們上同鄉會去吧！」　　「去看看熟人也好。」　　兩人走到西藏路，許多人都佇足在鐵欄旁邊，張望着里面空曠的塲。穿紅衣的鞭着一匹稷色的馬奔馳着。產頭滾處，欄外那羣襤褸的孩子大聲地呌了起來。　　南京路上人太擠了，男的，女的，紅的，綠的，一九三二年的春裝，熱鬧，繁華，……。兩人佇立了足有兩分鐘，才走過浙江路。　　從又一個弄裹，轉灣，上了樓，呼呀呼的人聲已傳進兩人的耳腔里。　　「呵　立凡，呵，雷君，好久沒見你們了，我正天天在此地打聽你們的行踪。」一個眼鏡擱在鼻尖上的中年人說。——他們的有着三年交情的前同事。　　「李先生，謝謝你，我是三三夜里從槍林彈雨里逃出來的。」　　「府上都好吧。我眞歡喜，我放下了一個担子。」　　「都好。」　　立凡移眼壁上，見貼的滿是紙條：「　　　現住菜市路平原坊　號」；「　　　脫險否」；「內科　　　現寓　　路　　里」；又有寫着緋紅色字的大幅紙，多麼刺目的紅字！立凡念了起來：　　『寗使全城不留寸草，……母墮　　三屠之令譽。　　　白。』　　立凡心中這時猶如萬箭攢心。雷君正與另一個熟識的人攀談，聽了立凡的聲音，也轉過頭來問：「「不留」什麼？呵呵，「三屠」，「　　三屠」！」李先生也抬起架着眼鏡的頭。　　忽然又一個人拍着立凡的肩，立凡並不認識他。顯然他是從農邨里來的，一副黧黑的面龐，垢污的藍布衫，哭喪着的臉。旁邊站着十來歲帶着鄉村氣的孩子。　　「先生，你是剛從鄉下出來的嗎？王家宅眞的燒成白地了嗎？」　　「我離家也好久啦，這不淸楚，大概不…」　　立凡還沒說了，旁邊一個長個子的人插進話來了：　　「千眞萬確，昨日有人從鄉下出來，小東街老早燒成白地，小學堂也燒完了……」　　「不，我問的是我們王家宅，爺叔！」　　「那，不大仔細，橫豎亂離世界……」　　「唉，唉，逃得了性命，到底，拿不了動用傢伙，唉，唉，難民局也不是長久之計，一家四五口，飄飄蕩蕩的，如何是好？唉唉！」　　這個人居然在大庭廣衆之間大聲地哭了起來，大家聽了都酸鼻。　　到後，這黧黑面龐的農夫拉着孩子的手說：　　「阿狗，回到難民局去不耍對阿婆說王家宅燒脫，懂嗎？記牢！」　　這被呼為阿狗的緊握着拳頭，點着頭，想到學校里先生講的帝國主義是怎樣一副面貌。　　立凡呆住啦！　　「凡，看那邊紳土們正在商量接濟維持會的事呢！」　　「什麼？什麼？」立凡像才驚醒過來似的，雷己拉着他的手，走近人叢去了。　　只見先是大塊頭的人搖擺着在說：　　「　先生能在鄉下多維持一天，地方原氣就少損一分。」　　「若能保持我家房屋安全，我願拿出三百塊錢。」　　這個有名的守財奴王廷詩居然也有慷慨的日子的，立凡滿腔是煩惱。　　「好在申錦西懂得　洋話，他說了好閒話，保全了我們的城子，也保全了我的家。眞正是恩同再造！」守財奴感激涕零的說。　　「實在年紀輕的人，大多沒有良心，這决若沒有申錦西，還了得，人家還駡他　奸，良心沒有了。」　　「噲，老張，你的意見到底怎麼樣？」　　「嘿，我倒不便說，說不要維持，你們說我講風涼話，說我橫豎自己房子也燒了，若說要，那麼—」講這話的人態度異常頹傷的，好像對於討論這問題絲毫感不到興趣，可是其他衰衰諸公明明又異常有精神的。　　這熱的天氣，這熱的人團，薰蒸着保家守產的紳士們。穿藍布衫的老鄉們漸漸將人團解散開，空氣也漸漸泠起來。立凡噓了口氣，身上感到一陣寒冷，他才知道自己的衣服太單薄了，寒峭的春風還不能使他脫了舊棉袍後將天氣來遷就他自己。　　立凡拉了雷，忽忽地向樓梯口跑。　　紳士們還在興高彩烈的商量着維持故鄉維持家產的辦法，雖然天陰下來，空氣也寒冷起來了。寒峭的春風正從窗眼里吹進來。　　賣晚報的孩子在街口高聲呌喊：「要看××兵殺掠××，要看××××，要看—」大上海風光白玉霜法庭現身記  文錚　　　上海目前的娛樂對象，可要算是蹦蹦戲最流行了：營業不振的影戲院和遊藝塲陸續拿蹦蹦戲來號召，差不多都會因之而扳本賺錢。但一提到蹦蹦戲，便會使人連想到「蹦蹦戲皇后」的白玉霜！說到白玉霜的號召力，據常跑娛樂塲的一班老上海談起，是頗不亞於當年的坤伶呂美玉的（美麗牌香煙上的美人便是她的小照）。蹦蹦戲是一種類似梆子又像大鼓的。一種道地北方戲—即河南戲——流行於北方民間已有百數十年的歷史。打一句北方鄉談，便是「唱落子」：文縐縐地說起來就呌「評戲」。每一齣戲都以「因果報應」為經：而以「現身說法」為緯。因為是「現身說法」，所以一切表演都極共「淋漓盡致」：無怪話劇家洪深在看了這戲以後要驚嘆不置了。他會說這種戲的刺激性比什麼戲都強，同時他還送了長於此道的白玉霜一個「東方梅蕙絲」的雅號。　　說也奇怪，當白玉霜第一决在恩派亞戲院上演的時候，連她自己也料不到會天天滿座，而且滿座之外還要加座，使那「秋娘老去」的恩派亞門前又車水馬龍的恢復了當年的盛況。因此，過了些時，便有人想請她上銀幕，但繼起的人雖然也同樣在演蹦蹦戲，可是呌座力究不及白玉霜那樣的大，於是白玉霜又重在恩派亞舞台現身了。為了白玉霜頗具有「特殊性」，所以就有人想用特殊手段來對她惡作劇，這大概就是拋糞案在上月二十七日晚上發生的原因吧。　　二月五日早上九點半鐘光景，特二法院第八法庭裏擠滿了旁聽的人，白玉霜偕同她的代理律師吳正薙到庭時，大家都含笑靨迎着，把法庭的門裹門外都軋得此路不通，甚至述白自己的坐位也找不着，後來經她家屬請人讓着擠着，才得到半個坐位休息了一會。她穿了一件洋灰鼠的大衣——灰背大衣——，把領子聳得高高地，幾乎是遮蓋了面龐，臉上一點脂粉也沒搽，但兩道秀眉，一雙星眼，卻使看過她戲的人一望而知。於是法庭上的人都向白一人望着，等到孫彭銜推事陞座，法警　「大家請站起來」時，大家才鴉雀無聲地靜坐着聽候傳訊。　　先是由法警把趙張兩犯帶到被告欄站定後，法官就　：「白玉霜到嗎？」她從椅子上立起身來，鼻子裹隨着「嗯」了一聲；在萬目睽睽下，姍姍地走到原告欄立着。不到一會，便有好幾個人擠到她身旁去站着，法警便又忙着維持秩序。本來，白因為污損了一件值價四百多塊的皮大衣才提出附帶民訴，要求賠價的；但聽說已經有人代她找到了主使人錢索，並從中調停，由對方答應了賠償，因此，在孫推事問白是吾要吿他們的時候，白就回答說：「我不認識這兩個人！我和他有什麼仇，有什麼恨呢？我告他們幹什麼呢？」她講話時，把頭略向左偏了一下，兩個眼珠子一轉，瞅了趙張二人兩眼。接着，孫推事又問道：「那你是不願意告他們了？」白點點頭，鼻子裹又回答了一個「嗯」。這時她兩眼朝着放在公座下的那包裹着的被污大衣，瞪了半天。她的律師吳正薙起初從皮包裏掏出一本小紅皮書看着，這時卻收進了皮包，提着神望着推事和捕房律師。　　孫推事便又掉過頭來向趙玉淸問道：「是誰指使你去拋糞的？」趙玉淸還囁嚅着沒有開口，張富瑞便搶着說：「是沒有捉着的徐開元！」孫推事再問趙說：「是不是張富瑞教你拋糞的呢？」趙供說：「張僅只呌我到許開元那裹去，事情沒有說明白！」孫推事又問張富瑞說：「你在捕房供說，為了河北同鄉會要請白玉霜去唱戲，她沒有答應，才向她拋糞的嗎？」張富瑞卻說：「我不知道！」孫推事又轉過臉問捕房警務處袁律師對於本案有什麽意見，袁律師站起來說：「毀損罪是吿訴乃論的，依法可以撤回；吿訴人不願追究，捕房也不反對，請將刑事部份，諭知不受理。但關於被告等違警部份，仍請依法處分　」孫推事聽了稍為停了一停，就當庭宣告判决：「趙玉淸污穢人之身體，處拘役十天，張富瑞教唆污穢人之身體，處拘役十五天。被毀損部份，不受理。」又向趙張二人說：「雖然白玉霜不願告你們，但你們的行為對於社會秩序有妨碍，不好。所以處罰！」又問「服不服？」趙張二人連說：「服！服！」這時立刻來了兩個法警，把趙張二人押了下去：白玉　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>霜也就轉身要走。但當時眞是人山人海。後由白的同來一個男子在前做開路先鋒，一面呌着請讓一讓；這時白又把大衣領向上聳了一聳，把頭藏進去；跟她來的一個娘姨便把包着的污損大衣拾起來，跟在白的後邊。全法庭的人，便也一閧地奮門而出，大家都竊竊私議：有說的「爲什麼這樣就了事？」有的說「也算看了一次白戲！」有的說：「可惜律師無用武之地，不然，辯論起來倒怪好聽的！」　　白玉霜出了法院門，一輛白牌出差車子已經在那裏等着。她上了車，旁邊一個四五十歲的老婦及替她做開路先鋒的男子也上了車，那拿衣包的娘姨卻嘻着嘴坐到車夫的旁邊。白玉霜臨去時向北後跟的人望了望，又對吳律師帶笑地打了一個招呼，於是那輛車便風馳電掣而去。這時跟她出法庭的人大家都停下了脚步，望著她車子後影半晌才四散了。　　聽說，白玉霜這兩天更加賣座，因爲她又在上海露了一次轟動社會的臉。星期文學會杜思退夫斯基五十五年祭  陸貽　　　　　克魯泡特金曾說：「屠格湼夫因爲杜思退夫斯基而蝕暗了，托爾斯泰在一個時間也被遺忘了」。我們當然不能因此就說杜思退夫斯基比屠格湼夫和托爾斯泰更偉大，但在事實上我們却不能不承認他是俄國三大作家之一，他的名字和他偉大的著作是全世界人都不會忘記的。一八八一年一月是他逝世的年月，今年正是他的五十五週年祭，我們相信全世界的人都不會把這件事情忘掉，都是要紀念這位偉大的作家的。　　杜思退夫斯基開始走入文學界，就獲得了很大的聲譽，成爲了當時俄國文壇上知名的靑年天才作家。這當然主要地是由於他的創作才能的不平凡，但同時也因爲當時俄國有認識才能並能積極扶助才能的先進作家。他在二十四歲時所作成的第一部作品「窮人」，經人介紹給詩人萊克拉索夫時，萊克拉索夫當晚就一口氣讀完了他的作品，而且馬上就跑去找他，慶賀他的成功；隨着更將這作品介紹給大批評家柏林斯基，這位大批評家一見這作品後就狂叫道：「新果戈里出現了！」同時還特別寫信鼓勵他，說他將「成爲一個大藝術家」。這樣，杜恩退夫斯基才在俄國文壇上大露頭角，繼續發展了他的才能。　　在「窮人」出世的四年之後，杜思退夫斯基因爲參加俄國政治史上著名的斐利埃黨運動而被捕了。後來他和另外的二十一個人竟被判處了死刑；在一八四九年十二月他被放上了死刑台，快要被處死的時候，幸而奉到特赦，才免於死。但是，「死罪已免，活罪難逃」，結果是被發配到西伯利亞，監禁在苦工監獄里。據說在這監禁中，他因偶然觸努了管囚，曾受了所謂「九條繩」的苛刑，所以後來他雖得由西伯利亞歸來，但他却得了終身的癎癲病，成爲了俄羅斯的作家中最不幸的一個。　　杜思退夫斯基的著作，除「窮人」之外，主要的有：「被虐待的人們」，「死人家里的回憶」，「罪與罰」，「加拉馬淑夫兄弟」，「靑年」，「白痴」，「惡魔」等。在這些著名的作品中，他所描寫的事件都可說是當時的一切病態的現象；他所表現出的各個典型人物多半是些神經病者·狂漢·病態的人們。因此，就有人用他個人的癎癲病去說明他的創作，以爲他所描寫的病態事件和人物是在他的癎癲病的影響之下作成的。這不消說是一種極膚淺的看法。自然，杜思退夫斯基的創作心理和創作方法，與他的癎癲病不無關係，但他所表現的一切都是他的時代中所有的實際現象，他的病症所給與他的心理影響，乃至他的個性的作用，都是通過他的時代精神和生活環境對他的作用而發生的，不能有獨立的意義，因而也不能用以解說他的創作。他曾向屠格湼夫說：「你不能够僅僅從新聞紙上知道生活」，這句話對於屠格湼夫是否適當，那自然是另一問題，不過由此可見杜思退夫斯基所描寫的生活，不僅不是新聞紙上表面的現實生活，而且也不是一般的表面的生活現象，他是深入到當時的生活的內部，很精細地描寫着它的。在杜思退夫斯基時代的俄羅斯正是地主貴族沒落的時代，所謂病態的事件，病態的生活，病態的人，都是存在於這時代中的。杜思退夫斯基生活在這樣的時代精神中，他便注意到了這些病態現象，並以他特有的創作方法把它們表現了出來。阿爾孔斯基曾說：「作者（指杜思退夫斯基——筆者）在作品中所採用的材料完全是黑暗面的人物及事情，作品中的主人翁全是些狂人，癎癲，自殺者，犯罪人等被社會蹂躪凌辱虐待着的人們。」這對於杜思退夫斯基所採用的題材，所描寫的人物，可是說一個具體的眞實的說明。　　如果戈理一樣，在某一點上說，杜思退夫斯基對於地主貴族是否定的。他無情地揭露出他們的墮落，僞善，他把在社會中被認爲下等的人物，如娼妓等的精神去與地主們的對立，把前者顯示得比後都偉大。如在他的名著「罪與罰」中，他就是把妓女索尼亞的誠實，善良去與地主盧辛的作僞，造謠，來對比的；我們相信，每一個「罪與罰」的讀者，在看到盧辛暗中將錢放入索尼亞的衣包內而當衆誣她偷竊的時候，都必然會對盧辛發生極大的憎惡的。但是，杜思退夫斯基並不澈底地去反對那些惡行的地方，他只是把他們的相貌描畫出來，而且，他爲要顯示反對惡行的人物的「偉大」，以至使這些人物成爲莫有辦法，沒有勇氣的善良的人們。因此，他雖是部分地而且是眞實地描畫了當時我俄羅斯的黑暗面，但他却使在這黑暗面下受虐待的人們沒有出路，沒有走向光明的認識和勇氣；在許多地方，他甚至表現了信神的思想，把那些被虐待的人們引到神的面前去求救。在「罪與罰」中，主人翁拉思柯爾尼考夫的反對高利貸者是用暗殺手段，而且，在他實行了暗殺之後馬上就懺悔起來，恐怖起來，終於是在殺人的心理的矛盾中自首了。這表示了「人性」是多麼的善良，但就在這種傾向下使他的作品缺少藝術的力量；在某一種上說來，這種傾向可說是與當時俄羅斯的客觀需要相矛盾的，因而也是相當地傷害了作品的藝術價值的。　　在俄國文學史上有普式庚和果戈理兩派的對立。岡澤秀虎在「果戈理和杜思退夫斯基」的論文中，對於這對立的特點和程度曾有明確的批判的說明；而且，還指出了杜思退夫斯基是果戈理的發展，是普式庚派的尖銳的對立者。他在批判了普式庚派和果戈理的創作方法之後說道：「單憑以上簡單的指出，也可知道果戈理的體式里面含着不能將他完全收容在普式庚派的東西。他的體式的若干特色，呌人看出跟普式庚的傾向原則上對立的新傾向。他是站在結合這兩個傾向的環樣的立塲上面的。在果戈理的藝術里面，有這兩個傾向的獨立的灌流。可以看作主流的雖然還是普式庚的傾向，但已暗暗開拓了新的河床，從這主流迸發出一股支流。而這支流一到杜思退夫斯基便成爲聲勢浩蕩的大河了。」的確，杜思退夫斯基的創作方法是比果戈理還要獨創的。在他的作品中，有許多地方的描寫法則都與果戈理的相類似，他所用的詞句有時也是來自果戈理的，從整個創作方法上看來，都可見到他是把果戈理的創作方法發展到了更高的程度；但是，正因爲他發展了果戈理在創作上的特點，所以顯示出了他不是單純的果戈理的模仿者，而是有偉大的獨創性的作家。　　杜思退夫斯基在他的一個初期的作品「脆弱的心」中說：「必須豫先說明和記述登塲人物的地位，職業，特別是性格吧，但因爲用這種方法開始寫作的作家很多，因爲這里所叙述的小說作者不願步上他們的後塵，就決心只從一個人目前的行爲開始下筆了。」這就是他的創作方法不平凡的表現。因爲他的創作方法是這樣地與衆不同，因爲他是先從人物的行爲本身寫到這行爲發生的原因，並在這發展中表現出人物的性格，地位等等，所以他的作品在開始看起來總覺得有點混亂，迷惑，不易了解。但在他那獨特的描寫的才能之下，能使你在讀他的作品時不斷地發生理解的好奇心，因之就是讀起來有點喫力，也非用力讀下去不可的。　　在心理的描寫上，杜思退夫斯基可說是最成功的一個偉大的作家。他的作品的主人翁的某一種行爲所發生的心理作用，他是從各方面去精深地描寫的。他不肯使事件一下子就結束，不肯使他的主人翁停止心理的活動，他能盡量精細地生動地從各方面表現出事件本身和主人翁的心理的發展。但這並未使你覺得他的描寫的鎖碎，冗長，反之，倒表現出了他的驚人的心理描寫的力量。文藝作品弟弟的喜事（四）  益　　　　　人多嘴雜，你一句，我一句，一時說東，一時說西，頭個還沒說完，第二個又接過去。聲音鬧雜雜的，滿院子成了娘兒們的世界！　　客人們是這麼「百無禁忌」的說着，鬧着，可把我媽媽急壞了，她生氣的說：　　「麻雀女子嫁一樣，嘰嘰喳喳的，賣兒賣女的話都搬了出來，討厭死了！」　　媽媽平素很高興親友往還，而且還愛講話兒，有時感覺寂寞，平日地請幾個鄰居老太婆來家談天，臨走還要贈送一些吃的東西，生恐委曲了別人。今天對待親友的冷淡很使我驚異，覺得這同她過去的性情差得太遠了！我不願意她無意義的煩惱，乃寬慰似的說：　　「媽，弟弟的事不要去管吧。親戚們總是瞧得起我們，纔……」　　「親戚？一輩子也理不淸呢。這個年頭，誰不想白吃別人幾天！」（未完）播音節目口琴　　悠社口琴組　　中西（一〇四〇）上午十時至十一時　　威廉退爾（二重奏）（過家容）（過祖畊）三潭印月　漢宮秋月（二重奏）（張舟影）（李志甫）比翼鳥（林勻粢）多諾河之波（張濛影）湖畔明月（過祖畊）小夜曲（潘沸心）雙頭之鷲（二重奏）（張濛影）（林勻粢）鳩（張舟影）加島之花（爵士卡爾奏法）（過祖畊）昔年春夢（李志甫）頑石行進曲（潘沸心）惜春歸（二重奏）（變體曲）（過家容）（過祖畊）　　民衆口琴隊　　大陸（六二〇）下午二時半至三時一刻　　密勒地序曲（二重奏）（嚴志高）（葉承懷）愛麗仙之女（盛積珊）郭公鳥圓舞曲（於以信）忘名草（鋼琴伴奏）（嚴志高）牧童短笛（二重奏）（朱家禮）（鳳馨）紅翼鳥（王永祥）卜郎琪將軍進行曲（二重曲）（王守誠）（唐雄俊）獨奏（石人望）鳥聲（鋼琴伴奏）（葉承懷）美國大軍進行曲（合奏）童子軍進行曲（合奏）電影消息曼琳霍金絲與佐麥克利在「燕歸來」中　　南京映「戰地英魂」延長映期　　換映印有華文字幕拷貝　　　　大光明自開映派拉蒙公司出品的「戰地英魂」The　Lives　of　A　Bengar　Lancer以來，無日不賣滿座，打破以前所有的紀錄，該院所排該片映期，原定映至昨日爲止，今因觀衆擁擠，欲罷不能，故祇得續映數天，並自今日起，換映片上印有中文字幕的最新拷貝，該項拷貝，日昨方自美國運到，字幕之簡潔清楚，比「十字英雄記」更有進步，國人觀此，對於劇中情節，可以一目瞭然，決無格格不入的困難了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hebei-Chahar Diplomatic Incident: Decision to Continue Negotiations in Beiping, Chen Zhongfu to be Responsible for Liaison, Song Zheyuan and Doihara Kento Both Arrived in Beiping, and Tian Went to Tongxian Yesterday to Meet with Yin Rugeng <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan returned to Beiping tonight. At the station, Song told reporters that the problem between China and Japan is one of equality. If one side is a weak country and the other oppresses it, it will be difficult to proceed. I previously returned to my ancestral home in Leling, Shandong, for two days. On the first day, I spoke with Chairman Han by telephone for an hour. On the second day, Chairman Han rushed to Leling and stayed there overnight. The discussion was about how to put the North China issue on a bright path. After the discussion, Chairman Han returned to Jinan, and I returned to Tianjin. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council will establish an education committee because the distance between the North and the South is too far, so it is convenient to handle matters nearby. After getting off the train, Song immediately returned to his private residence in Wuyiku to rest. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Chen Zhongfu said that the outside world is speculating that the Jidong incident will be resolved by exchanging Yin Rugeng's Changjin City. This is not true. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Song Zheyuan left Tianjin at 5:15 PM on the 8th with his family to return to Beiping. The Beining Railway arranged a special train with six cars, which did not stop at any station and arrived in Beiping at 8:00 PM. The center of Hebei-Chahar diplomacy has shifted to Beiping, and Song will not come to Tianjin again in the short term. Xiao Zhenying said that the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic situation has indeed eased, but the specific measures have not been determined. After the negotiations move to Beiping, Commissioner Chen Zhongfu will be responsible for consulting with Doihara Kento. A resolution is expected soon. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 8th, Doihara Kento, accompanied by Takeshita Yoshiharu, the chief of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Yuguan, and Chen Zhongfu, the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Foreign Affairs Committee, left Tianjin for Beiping in the same car. According to those responsible for foreign affairs in Hebei-Chahar, the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic incident will be discussed further in Beiping. Doihara Kento will be responsible for the Japanese side. It is not yet determined whether he will reside in Beiping for a long time. Outside reports say that the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has hired Doihara Kento as a senior advisor, but nothing has been decided yet, and the Japanese side has not made this request. Negotiations on the Jidong issue will begin first. The Japanese side believes that the abolition of the Jidong puppet government should be postponed and decided after an inspection of the situation. There is no sign of Zhuo Shikai's troops advancing towards Suidong. There are no Japanese troops stationed in the Zhangbei area. Most of the puppet Li Shouxin army has withdrawn to the area between Guyuan and Baochang. Only a small number are stationed in Zhangbei. The current situation in Hebei-Chahar is still good. The safety of the future can only be observed depending on the extent of the diplomatic development. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Chen Zhongfu, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, arrived in Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon. According to him, China and Japan have agreed to continue negotiations in Beiping regarding Hebei-Chahar's diplomatic matters. The focus of the negotiations on the Jidong issue is our demand to abolish the war zone, to which the Japanese side has not made a concrete response. However, if we can proceed actively, we can expect results in the short term. There are rumors that Zhuo Shikai's troops have invaded five counties in Suidong. I have heard that there is no such intention. Currently, there are no Japanese troops in Zhangbei. Song is scheduled to arrive in Beiping this afternoon. I do not know whether Doihara Kento will reside in Beiping for a long time. Whether he will serve as a senior advisor to the Political Council has not yet been fully decided. The Foreign Affairs Committee will convene a meeting in the coming days. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Supervisory Committee Member Du Yi Commits Suicide by Drowning <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Held Celibacy Ideal, Suffered from Constipation and Became Pessimistic</p>
<p>Nanjing: Du Yi, a member of the Supervisory Committee, committed suicide by drowning himself in a lake on the night of the 7th. He left behind a poem and a self-composed elegiac couplet. Du was 51 years old, from Jinghai, Hebei, and fond of chemistry. He had always held a celibacy ideal. Du had recently suffered from constipation and had not recovered after seeing a doctor and taking medicine. He had told his friend Chen Zifeng that he was determined to commit suicide, and Chen had comforted him. On the evening of the 7th, Du returned to his residence by Xuanwu Lake. After washing his feet, he said to his servant, "Tonight is the Lantern Festival, and the weather is extremely cold. You should go to bed early." At 7:00 AM on the 8th, the servant entered the bedroom and saw that the bed was empty and the long robe was still hanging on the hanger. He suspected that he had gone out to urinate. He asked other servants, who all replied that they had not seen him. After carefully observing the situation, he saw footprints on the small path covered with snow outside the back door. He followed the footprints to the lake and found footprints on the ice by the lake. Two feet ahead, he was shocked to see a corpse floating in the water. It was indeed Du, and he had been dead for a long time. The police were notified to carry the body ashore. Wang Luyi, the Secretary-General of the Committee, drove to the scene and inspected the bedroom. He found a poem, a self-composed elegiac couplet, and a letter to the President of the Committee and his friend Nuoyou on the table. Wang immediately telegraphed the Renxiao Funeral Home to transport the body to the funeral home. The poem reads: "Madly chanting a sentence on a lost night, how can the past be searched again and again? Clouds cover the eyes in the distant fortress, the moon imprints the center of the water in the empty pool. All day long, old friends are like jade, but everywhere there is war and the earth is not golden. Sometimes I feel clear and sometimes I feel annoyed, and I want to put down my clothes and abandon my books and qin." The self-composed couplet reads: "Obtain the Three Immeasurable Three Lanes, not empty and empty, manifesting all aspects with one face, like an illusion existing in an illusion." It was signed "Du Xu, self-composed." On the 8th, the Supervisory Committee received an urgent letter from Du Hai Tian, Du Yi's younger brother, from his hometown. The colleagues in the Committee opened and read it together. The letter said that he had received a letter from his brother saying that he was seriously ill, but asked him to seek treatment quickly and not to be pessimistic. This proves that Du had written to his brother telling him that he was seriously ill, confirming that he had intended to commit suicide before sending the letter. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Citizens Were Enthusiastically Celebrating the Lantern Festival; Great Chaos During the Earthquake, Quickly Restored</p>
<p>Lanzhou: Starting at 3:30 PM on the 7th, Lanzhou was hit by three consecutive earthquakes. The extent of the earthquake in each county is still unknown. According to experienced people, the earthquake today was a lateral shaking of the earth's crust, not an up-and-down or undulating movement, otherwise, it would have caused a major disaster. It was found that only a few houses outside the city of Lanzhou collapsed, which did not cause a disaster, which is very fortunate. The 7th was the old lunar Lantern Festival. Lanzhou was decorated with lanterns and ribbons, and citizens were enthusiastically celebrating, with men and women pouring out of the city. Before the earthquake, more than 20,000 men and women gathered in front of the Provincial Government to watch the Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi Joint Music Association perform. The roofs around were also full of people. When the earthquake occurred, the houses shook, and the audience was terrified. Some people fell from the roofs and were injured. There was great chaos for a while. After 4:00 PM, the situation returned to normal, and the city was ablaze with lights all night. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Judicial Yuan interpreted two doubts: whether a legal person can file a private prosecution and the procedure for withdrawing a private prosecution. The Yuan's interpretation is as follows: When a legal person is the victim, its representative may file a private prosecution. When a private prosecutor withdraws a private prosecution in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 317 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the clerk should notify the defendant of the reason for withdrawing the private prosecution in accordance with paragraph 3 of the same regulation, without the need for a judgment. If a private prosecution case does not comply with the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 317 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and the private prosecutor requests the withdrawal of the private prosecution, it is obviously illegal, and the court should reject it by a ruling.

<h3 id="e43">The World's Raw Material Distribution Problem <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>In recent days, many British and American politicians have raised the issue of raw material distribution. In the United States, Secretary of State Hull advocated opening up the world's raw materials so that countries lacking raw materials can obtain them peacefully without resorting to military force. In the United Kingdom, former Labour Party leader Lansbury expressed the view that the only way to eliminate today's world crisis is to redistribute the world's raw materials, and the method is to redistribute the world's colonies. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George even supported Lansbury's proposal to reconsider the League of Nations mandate territories. These politicians have recognized the struggle for raw materials as an important factor in war and are seeking ways to resolve it.</p>
<p>Although both Hull and Lansbury's arguments focus on the distribution of raw materials, their methods are very different. Hull advocates the free flow of world raw materials through international agreements, while Lansbury focuses on the redistribution of colonies. We have not yet seen the details of these two proposals, and the proponents may not even have concrete solutions. However, the advantages and disadvantages are already obvious. Hull's proposal is relatively fair, while Lansbury's proposal is tantamount to military plunder. Why is it that international figures today oppose aggressive countries because they oppose their treatment of people in colonies? Although the proposal to redistribute colonies does not openly encourage military aggression, it tacitly acknowledges the legitimacy of their actions. This is one reason. Secondly, the so-called redistribution of colonies means that countries with too many colonies should divide some of them to countries lacking colonies to show balance. This may be a generous and elegant action when strong countries transfer territories to each other, but it greatly disregards the personality of the colonial people. This is the second reason. Thirdly, a truly just international proposal should abolish colonies altogether and seek to communicate raw materials through purely trade methods. We do not yet know whether the contradictions and conflicts between the great powers can be eliminated, and the identity of colonies will never be resolved. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>However, the actual value of these two proposals is questionable. The reason why ambitious countries today do not hesitate to invade other countries by force is that on the one hand, they are competing for raw materials, and on the other hand, they are competing for markets. Therefore, colonies are not only a source of raw materials for imperialists but also a market for imperialists to sell goods. The reason why raw materials are in great demand is nothing more than to maintain or expand their domestic industry. If imperialists abandon part of their inherent colonies, the maintenance and expansion of their domestic industry will become a problem due to the loss of part of the market. Moreover, as current facts show, countries are trying to block markets within their sphere of influence and are trying their best to compete for markets beyond their reach. The former uses the method of building high tariff barriers in their own country to make it difficult for goods from other countries to enter, while the latter uses the method of currency devaluation and exchange dumping. Today's great powers are intent on using these two weapons and will never look back. To say that they can discuss the redistribution of colonies is to be ignorant of the truth of the matter. As for Hull's proposal, it is considered too lofty and difficult to achieve results. It includes not only the distribution of raw materials but also the distribution of markets. How the market will be distributed in what proportion is a major problem.</p>
<p>In short, Lansbury's method is a method of replacing violence with violence. This kind of method may be generous between strong countries, but it only shows its unkindness to weak and helpless nations. As for Hull's method, considering the setbacks of the 1933 World Economic Conference and the current naval conference, it is feared that there will be no good results.</p>

<p>Cooperating with Outer Mongolia for Defense</p>
<p>Harbin. Since the intensification of the disputes between Japan, the puppet state, Soviet Russia, and Mongolia, the Soviet Union, fearing that Japanese and puppet troops would pressure Outer Mongolia from Inner Mongolia and attack the Soviet Union, has stationed troops on the border between Inner and Outer Mongolia to cooperate with the Mongolian army for defense. Currently, the military preparations between Kulun and Ude are the responsibility of the Second Battalion of the 48th Regiment of the 25th Brigade of the 14th Division of the Far Eastern Red Army. The battalion headquarters is located in Ude, including Motezhen (one company), Kololo San (forty people), Okomoer (two companies), Bisierge (thirty people), Bielgete (twenty people), Xiong Youluomo Osk (two companies), Uyula (thirty people), Senzhi (twenty people), and Ude (battalion headquarters). The battalion has two reconnaissance planes, ten fighter planes, one light bomber, and one heavy bomber. The standing air force is also equipped with dozens of machine guns and field guns, and five forts have been built.

<p>Geneva. The Committee of Experts on the League of Nations' Oil Embargo has now reached a conclusion that if the League of Nations implements an oil embargo against Italy, Italy's oil reserves will only be sufficient for several months, at most eight to ten months. The political preparations for the oil embargo will take three to four months to complete. The Committee of Experts' report has not yet been completed. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Geneva. The Committee of Experts on the League of Nations' Oil Embargo, believing that Italy might be able to substitute oil with some substitutes once the oil embargo is implemented, appointed a committee to study this issue. After deliberation, the committee has reached a conclusion that Italy, no matter how frugal it is with gasoline, must continue to import a large amount from foreign countries. Even if it is frugal, it will only be about 110,000 tons per year, and it must depend on the following factors: whether Italy can produce the raw materials necessary for refining gasoline within its borders; whether it can import the necessary raw materials from foreign countries; whether Italy can manufacture or import from foreign countries the tools necessary for manufacturing and using liquid fuels to replace heavy oil; and finally, it must depend on Italy's financial situation.

<p>Berlin. Political figures believe that if the League of Nations' oil embargo against Italy is implemented, it will not be enough to stop the Italian-Abyssinian War. On the contrary, it may cause Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations, and its relations with the countries that implement sanctions will become increasingly tense. Germany, which has always maintained a neutral attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, will continue to strictly maintain neutrality in the future. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Geneva. The Committee of Experts on the League of Nations' Oil Embargo previously appointed a committee to study the issue of oil transportation. The report that the committee should submit has been released tonight, and its conclusion is that if the oil embargo against Italy is to be effective, the best way to do so is to prohibit the sale of oil tankers to countries that do not participate in the embargo, so that they cannot help Italy. According to the experts, Italy can only mobilize 82 oil tankers. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>The Story of Troop Deployment to Defend the Border Passes is Not True</p>
<p>Rome. It is reported that Italy, in order to prove that it has not been detached from European affairs, has redeployed troops to the Brenner Pass area on the Italian-Austrian border. This news has been denied by semi-official sources, who said that if there is to be any organization for Central European issues, it cannot be done without Italy's participation. This has been proven by the recent international talks held in London and Paris. Therefore, there is no need for Italy to redeploy troops to the Brenner Pass. In addition, foreign sources say that at the recent meeting of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party, some members advocated that Italy's attitude should be more moderate so that the Abyssinian issue can be easily resolved.

Italy Divides the Country into Eight Military Regions <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>London. The Daily Telegraph recently reported that the international situation is becoming increasingly serious, and Foreign Secretary Eden is now deeply convinced that for the benefit of peace, Britain's national defense must be placed in the strongest position in the shortest possible time. Germany's efforts to expand its military are enough to make Britain pay close attention, and the policy currently followed by Japan cannot but be of concern. As for the claim that Germany and Japan and Germany and Hungary have concluded mutual assistance agreements, Paris and Moscow still firmly believe that this is the case. Regarding the German-Hungarian agreement, it is said that it was discussed last September when Hungarian Prime Minister Gombos and German Aviation Minister General Goering were hunting on the Lithuanian border in East Prussia. Furthermore, Italy may also have reached an understanding with Germany, which is also enough to attract Britain's attention. According to news obtained here, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now formulating a plan to divide the country into eight military districts and train several new recruits separately. It is rumored that General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, has been summoned back to the country to implement this plan. In addition, the newspaper also reported that even if the oil embargo against Italy is not implemented, some countries are now planning to reduce the amount of oil shipped to Italy to be equal to the pre-war figure to show that they do not support Italy's expeditionary policy.

<p>London. Reuters has learned that when French Foreign Minister Flandin recently visited London to attend the funeral of King George, he suggested to British Foreign Secretary Eden that a Mediterranean Pact be concluded. This pact would be like "the Locarno Pact of the Mediterranean." Once established, the additional detachments of the British fleet currently stationed in the Mediterranean could be gradually withdrawn. The proposal was only tentative, but Eden did not agree, saying that Britain could not conclude a non-aggression pact with a country that has clearly become an aggressor, and there is no hope of establishing this pact even after the Abyssinian War ends. It is said that Flandin also explored this proposal with Italy, but Italy also viewed it coldly. Flandin is no longer pursuing other suggestions. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Argument for Redistributing World Resources. British Experts Say It's Difficult to Implement <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>But it has Attracted National Attention in Japan</p>
<p>London. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare made a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly on September 11 last year, and his conclusion was, "Looking at the current situation, economic issues are more important than political issues. The British government is now prepared to work with all countries to study the method of redistributing world resources and mandate territories." Since the publication of this statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed several experts to study the issue of the distribution of world markets and raw materials. According to our reporter, the experts concluded that the main obstacle to this issue lies in the fact that some countries, such as Germany and Italy, are financially exhausted and have no resources to manage even if they obtain colonies. The experts also studied the issue of ceding territory, believing that whether the object of cession is Germany, Italy, other countries without colonies, or countries that have colonies but feel that they are not self-sufficient, the conclusion can be divided into the following two points: Those who make this request are nothing more than politically driven by dictatorship, and their desire for prestige naturally gives rise to a desire for territory. In the current situation, any country can cede colonial territory to other countries, and domestic opposition may not be drastic, to the point of being irreversible. This can be seen in the fact that when Eden, then Minister Without Portfolio and now Foreign Secretary, visited Italy last August, he was willing to cede a strip of British Somaliland along with the port of Zeila to Abyssinia. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The British Parliament's debate on the distribution of raw materials and colonies on February 5 has attracted widespread attention in Japan. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today in response to questions from foreign journalists that British and other politicians are now paying close attention to the need to redistribute raw materials, colonies, and markets. For the sake of world peace, this is very gratifying. In the past, various international plans have been adopted to maintain peace, such as the balance of power system before the war, the League of Nations Kellogg-Briand Pact after the war, and the non-aggression pact. However, these plans did not pay attention to the real causes of endangering peace. If we want to permanently eliminate the causes of disturbing peace, we must give appropriate consideration to emerging countries. To give an example, there are some countries that are full of vitality but cannot develop in the current international order. It is fair to give these countries the raw materials and markets necessary for their national survival. However, a small number of great powers are now monopolizing vast lands, natural resources, and markets, and adhering to a policy of rejecting others. This situation is not conducive to promoting world peace. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's chief economic advisor, having spent half a year in China and completed his mission, will soon return home. Together with Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, he will submit an on-the-ground report to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, to facilitate a reassessment of Britain's East Asia policy. On his return journey, he will make a stop in Japan, where he is expected to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota and other relevant parties. The Foreign Ministry received informal notification of this plan on the 8th. Last summer, during Niemeyer's transit to China, he visited Japan, stating that he would return after observing China to discuss the adjustment of Sino-British-Japanese relations based on his experience. Considering this pre-arranged plan, the Japanese government has decided to adopt a welcoming attitude. Foreign Minister Hirota intends to use the meeting to thoroughly explain the current state of Sino-Japanese relations, strongly advocate that Sino-Japanese cooperation and amity can genuinely promote world peace, and explain the reasons for this. Furthermore, he will request that the British government have an accurate understanding of East Asian issues. He also intends to frankly seek Niemeyer's opinion on China's currency reform and the Sino-British relationship at that time, and if there is any misunderstanding about British orchestration, he will ask for clarification, to clarify the relationship between China, Britain and Japan.

(8th, Havas)</p>
<p>London: Sir Eric Phipps, the British Ambassador to Germany, will soon return home to report to the government on Germany's demands for the restoration of colonies and the remilitarization of the Rhineland. According to news from Berlin, the German government has no intention of raising the issue of Rhineland fortification at this time. However, if the French Parliament ratifies the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty (the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to discuss the treaty on the 11th of this month), Germany will inevitably construct fortifications along the Rhineland as a precautionary measure. Regarding this, it is reported that the British Foreign Office favors establishing a treaty that would restore Germany's full sovereignty over the Rhineland to satisfy its wishes, while reaffirming the obligations stipulated in the Locarno Pact to ensure France's security, thereby resolving the Rhineland issue. Regarding Germany's demand for the restoration of colonies, British public opinion fears that if Germany is entrusted with the administration of certain territories, it may mistreat the indigenous people, thus expressing strong opposition. It is generally believed that the British government, influenced by public opinion, will not consider the colonial issue at present. However, some political figures advocate returning the League of Nations mandated territories to their original countries to establish colonization companies under international management. If this were done, the issue of improving raw material distribution, as demanded by Italy, could be realized. Financial experts, however, believe that participating in such companies would place a heavy financial burden on some countries, such as Italy, and therefore express dissent. (7th, Havas)</p>

<p>Italian and French Attitudes Remain Firm</p>
<p>London: The expert subcommittee of the General Committee of the Naval Conference met today and adopted the report of the warship definition issue group (content see yesterday's telegram). They then discussed the issue of qualitative limitations. As a result of the meeting, it was generally felt that Italy's attitude on the issue of battleship tonnage was as firm as France's. The US representative was the first to speak today, insisting on the original proposal of 35,000 tons for battleship tonnage, but accepting the British proposal of a 14-inch gun caliber (the US originally proposed 16 inches). Another British proposal was also accepted by the US, namely not building 10,000-ton cruisers for a certain period. However, it was stated that accepting this proposal did not mean that 10,000-ton cruisers would be abolished in the future. The US also expressed support for two proposals, namely classifying Class B cruisers and destroyers as the same type of warship, and limiting submarine tonnage to 2,000 tons (as proposed by the UK). Subsequently, the British representative reiterated the UK's recently stated views, stating that although the UK accepted the figure of 35,000 tons for battleship tonnage, it preferred to reduce it to 25,000 tons, and that 10,000-ton cruisers should be abolished. The French and Italian representatives spoke successively, maintaining their original positions on the battleship tonnage issue (i.e., limiting it to 27,000 tons or 28,000 tons), and supported limiting submarine tonnage to 2,000 tons. The subcommittee is scheduled to continue its meeting on Monday afternoon. (7th, Havas)</p>
<p>London: Delegations participating in the naval conference of the four countries of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy are now engaged in arguing over the form of battleships. At a subcommittee meeting held today, each delegation expressed its views on qualitative limitations. The US delegation requested that battleships be limited to 35,000 tons and equipped with 16-inch caliber guns. However, it stated that the US government was willing to consider setting the gun caliber at 14 inches. The US delegation agreed not to consider 10,000-ton cruisers during the effective period of any treaty and supported the British proposal to limit the maximum tonnage of submarines to 2,000 tons. In short, the four countries participating in the naval conference are almost entirely in agreement on everything except the largest form of battleships. This issue will now be handed over to the chief representatives of the four countries for decision. The UK advocates limiting battleships to 25,000 tons, while France and Italy want to limit them to 27,500 tons. (7th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(10) Tragic Scenes in the Autonomous Vortex</p>
<p>Beiping was the capital of the Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the central government was still located here. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and renamed Beiping as a city, directly under the Executive Yuan. At the end of last year, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was established, and Beiping was transferred to its jurisdiction. Its political, cultural, and transportation status in the north has not declined. Unfortunately, it is surrounded by foreign forces, which has become a major problem.</p>
<p>The commercial centers of Beiping are Qianmenwai, Wangfujing Street, and Dong'an Market. The shops outside Qianmen are known for their established brands and long history. The so-called "old residents of Beijing" insist on buying their goods (especially clothing) from there. In recent years, due to changing times, most of these old residents have declined, and commerce outside Qianmen has greatly deteriorated. Wangfujing Street is known for its splendor and grandeur, and its appearance can almost be compared to Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Dong'an Market is known for its delicacy and exquisiteness, with stalls lining the streets and a variety of goods on display, making it even more tempting than Wangfujing. Therefore, general customers, especially modern men and women, prefer to go there. Foreign tourists visiting Beiping also consider a tour of the market a necessary part of their itinerary. The population of Beiping decreased sharply after the capital moved south, but it has been increasing daily since the September 18th Incident. By last year, it had increased to over 1.5645 million people. However, this sharp increase is mostly due to unemployed and impoverished people from the Northeast who have been displaced and moved in, and they have very little purchasing power. At the same time, foreign goods take advantage of Chinese tariffs, lower exchange rates, and are sold cheaply in our markets. Therefore, Dong'an Market is filled with foreign goods, including cosmetics, children's toys, daily household goods, and industrial products. Finding domestic goods is like finding gold in sand. What is shocking is that a young woman in a leather coat wanted to buy domestic goods, and a foreign plainclothes man saw her and dared to slap her in the face in public. Those who wanted to defend her were persuaded to stop. With this situation, the Beiping market will be dominated by foreign goods in the future.</p>
<p>Since last winter, inns and apartments in Beiping have been forcibly rented by foreign ruffians and Koreans for setting up gambling dens and selling drugs. If the landlord inquires, they destroy property and demand compensation. When a gambling den first opened, no one entered, so they came up with the idea of asking the Chamber of Commerce to help maintain it. A prominent merchant could not refuse and invited his friends to gamble, but they all lost tens of thousands of yuan. The drugs they sell are toxins that spread to weaken the country and exterminate the race, and many ignorant compatriots are lured into the fire pit. Officials, probably driven by conscience, obtained the consent of the Japanese police and recently conducted a raid, arresting over 600 opium addicts and gamblers. In the war zone (eastern Hebei), foreign firms are rampant, and drugs are flooding the area. In just two years, 2.8 million people have become addicted to various drugs, with white powder addicts accounting for more than half, totaling 1.5 million people. A certain concession in Tianjin used to be a den of opium, gambling, and drugs. A certain person of importance made a statement upon arrival that he would not investigate opium and gambling. The poison will spread, and it will become the second war zone.</p>
<p>The cost of living in Beiping is the lowest among the six major cities in the country. However, the area has been a political city since ancient times, mainly consuming and producing very little. It is difficult for people to make a living, and there are many poor families. The number of impoverished people eating at congee factories in winter increases greatly every year. After the September 18th Incident, the compatriots who fled from the Northeast to Beiping initially thought that the lost territories would be recovered soon and that they would be able to return home. Unexpectedly, day after day, their hopes turned into dreams. Families below the middle class became increasingly poor, and their lives were as miserable as the bannermen after the Qing Dynasty collapsed. The students from the Northeast were especially brave in the two student movements in Beiping. Later, the students went to various counties to awaken the masses. The wealthier compatriots from the Northeast also took the lead in donating慰勞品. The affection is great, and it is unbearable to describe in detail.</p>
<p>There are over 40,000 rickshaws operating in Beiping, and some are rented out day and night, with two people pulling one rickshaw. But the income is very low. A long pull of more than ten miles usually only earns about ten cents in legal tender. According to a friend from the Northeast, some of the hot-blooded men who had been in the volunteer army, after failing and entering the pass, were forced by life to support themselves by pulling rickshaws. I once heard a rickshaw puller complain that "a foreigner rode in my rickshaw without paying, and when I reported it to the police, I was reprimanded instead." Another rickshaw puller replied loudly, "Who told you to be useless and pull the ______." Is this the hot-blooded man that my friend described?</p>
<h3 id="e69">Liu Xiang: Training County Government Personnel <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Second Group of Trainees Graduated, Personally Approved by Liu Xiang; Third Group Begins Enrollment</p>
<p>Chengdu News, When the Sichuan Provincial Government was reorganized the year before last, Liu Xiang took charge of provincial administration, making the elimination of excessive taxes and the implementation of a unified tax system the first step in reforming Sichuan's administration. Liu Xiang also recognized that Sichuan had been in turmoil for too long, and that in order to fundamentally reform politics, it was necessary to start with the practical transformation of county government personnel, the so-called "officials who are close to the people." Therefore, last year he established a training institute for county government personnel. When Liu Xiang convened the first group of trainees for instruction, he said, "Throughout history, order and chaos have alternated, and a few individuals have always been the backbone. Because their actions and ideas can win the sympathy and support of the majority, and establish a good model, this becomes the prevailing trend. In the past, during the defense zone system, officials appointed people like bookkeeping, regardless of their talent or lack thereof, and all were appointed. As a result, all kinds of bad things happened, and the superiors had to take responsibility for them. In such cases, the fault lies with the subordinates, but it is not necessarily that the superiors are all good or bad. You should be careful not to disappoint your superiors in your future dealings." He also said, "County government personnel have many things to do, and it is easiest for them to show results. Take the stele of virtuous government as an example; there is not a single county without a stele of virtuous government for the county magistrate, but there are very few people above the county magistrate who are praised by the people. People like Zhuge Wuhou, Luo Wenzhong, and Ding Wencheng are remembered because they made special contributions in Sichuan, so their ancestral temples are still preserved for people to admire. Otherwise, there are not many others. You should administer the people with a public heart, and the local people will never forget you. However, county government personnel are also more miserable than other classes. In counties close to bandit areas, they must assist the army in eliminating the remaining bandits. Local officials have heavy responsibilities, and the local bullies who control local affairs will routinely try to win them over and surround them when a new official arrives. If the county magistrate is confused, he will inevitably be deceived. Once deceived, there will be a day of utter confusion. To sum it up, the combination of theory and practice is essential. The lessons you learn in the institute and the instructions you listen to from your superiors are all theory. After graduation, you will be assigned to positions and seek performance in practice. This is what is called practice. The most important task for Sichuan in the future is to develop the border areas. To do a good job, there is a great shortage of talent. In the future, as long as each of you can take responsibility and be down-to-earth, you can overcome the environment. I hope you will endure hardship and be diligent, not be corrupt, not be slippery, eliminate bad habits, and strive to cultivate virtue and intelligence. Move forward on the broad and bright path, and Sichuan's provincial status and reputation will surely be restored to a great extent." His words were very pertinent, and Liu's deep expectations for county government personnel, the "officials who are close to the people," can also be seen from his speech. The training of these county government personnel, in addition to the first group of personnel being assigned to service after graduation, the second group of personnel has also reached the end of their term and graduated. The list of graduates has been approved by the provincial authorities and posted on the third day of this month. It includes 34 people selected for the county magistrate class, including Zhang Suineng, and 352 people selected for the assistant administrator class, including Zhou Damin (of which Zhou Damin and 13 others had excellent grades, but their qualifications were slightly inferior, so they were temporarily recorded as county magistrates). It is said that the determination of the grades of the graduates was personally made by Liu Xiang as the final approval, and the procedure was extremely careful. According to Deng Mingjie, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, "At the beginning of his tenure, Chairman Liu was determined to reform the officialdom and believed that governing people was more important than governing laws. Therefore, he first started by breaking the habit of 'appointing people based on personal connections.' He specially requested and was approved by the Military Affairs Commission to establish a civil service qualification review committee, and the entrance examination for the county training institute was also entrusted to it. This time, for the graduation of the second group of students from the county training institute, Liu Xiang took special care. He first ordered the heads of the various departments and the members of the Public Review Committee to conduct oral examinations separately, and secretly draft comments. Finally, Liu Xiang personally conducted oral examinations, referring to the comments of the heads of the various departments and the members of the Public Review Committee to make the final decision. As for the standard of selection, it is purely based on academic qualifications and abilities. Generally speaking, those who are clearly deemed suitable for appointment as county magistrates by the heads of the various departments, the members of the Public Review Committee, and the authorities of the county training institute are included in the county magistrate class. Those whose academic performance and qualifications are only partly acceptable are still included in the assistant administrator class, or those whose academic performance is relatively better are recorded as county magistrates, because their academic qualifications are already excellent, and if they can be further trained, they will achieve even greater achievements in the future. As for those who have more experience as county magistrates, emphasis is placed on their ability to handle affairs, rather than purely on listening and memorizing, which is intended to care for young people on the one hand and value experienced people on the other." In addition, the third group of county training, transferred personnel, on the first day of this month, has already held a written test at the county training institute. More than 200 people came to take the test. On the fifth day of this month, an oral test was held, and on the sixth day, a physical examination was conducted, and then the training was officially started. It is also learned that the written test questions, the first question is to draft a report as a county magistrate of a certain county, listing the long-standing malpractices in the collection of taxes, and proposing methods for rectification, so as to benefit both the national treasury and the people's livelihood; the second question is to draft a proclamation from the provincial government to officials and people throughout the province, advocating propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, in order to rectify people's hearts and strengthen the foundation of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e70">The Kakuda Incident: Surface Tensions Ease Slightly <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Our Side Has Raised Questions for Investigation, but Expansion Remains Possible</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Due to the sudden death of Japanese police officer Kakuda in Shantou last month, the situation in Chaoshan suddenly became tense. Although the incident has superficially eased, Lieutenant General Kajikawa stated to others when passing through Shantou on the 29th that this case is of the same nature as the sniping of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo in Shanghai. If the feelings between the two sides have not broken down, it is still possible to find a way to resolve the matter. This case is still worth paying close attention to. The authorities are keeping the details of the negotiations on this case a secret, probably because they are still under investigation and have not yet reached the stage where they can be disclosed. The protest previously lodged by the Japanese Consul in Shantou was refuted by our side with various points of suspicion, and the Japanese side then agreed to have experts investigate the true cause of Kakuda's death, while also asking our side to assist in the search for the murderer. What remains to be investigated in this case is the evidence presented by the Japanese side that Kakuda was sniped, such as: the two blood-stained bullets removed from the corpse by Japanese doctors at the Japanese Philanthropic Hospital; the injury report on the surface of the corpse examined by British doctor Hall at the Gospel Hospital; the photos of the bullet holes on the wall where the deceased fell in Mingde Lane; and the photo of the threatening letter received by Kakuda from the anti-smuggling team before his death. Our side has also raised several points of suspicious evidence, such as: none of the residents near Lianhe Lane and Mingde Lane heard any gunshots at the time; there were no bloodstains at the spot where the deceased fell; the Japanese Philanthropic Hospital refused to allow police officer Shi Guopan to accompany the body upstairs; the removal of the bullets from the corpse was not supervised by our side; why was it necessary to rush to remove the bullets from the corpse; having already been taken to the hospital and died, why wait two hours before reporting the case; the bullet wound in the corpse was slanted downwards, the bullet entered the body and turned before exiting; the wound only had some small congealed blood. All of these are suspicious, and experts urgently need to investigate them. It is heard that the case has now been transferred to Guangzhou for negotiation.</p>
<p>On February 1, the Japanese Navy, due to the Kakuda incident, dispatched two additional warships, "Akikaze" and "Hamakaze," to Shantou, bringing the total number of Japanese warships in Shantou to five, seemingly as a show of surveillance. Lieutenant General Kajikawa traveled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou on the 4th, ostensibly for a courtesy visit, but it is said that he was actually carrying out a major mission, which was to persuade the authorities to expand the organization for autonomy and anti-communism, and to increase the centrifugal force of the Southwest against the Central Government. In short, the Kakuda incident in Shantou at this time is a hidden danger, and the situation may escalate at any time. The three Japanese warships "Yubari," "Hayabusa," and "Ume" that had been in Shantou for a long time suddenly left Shantou for Xiamen on the 2nd, but the Japanese side has not relaxed its grip on the Chaoshan area.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Gansu Provincial Government Stipulates Plan for Conscripting Labor <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Dedicated to Road Building, River Dredging, and Afforestation, with Strict Orders for All Agencies to Comply</p>
<p>Lanzhou News, Provincial Government Chairman Yu Xuezhong previously received the "Outline of Winter Labor Conscription Measures" promulgated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Although civil servants in the provincial capital and people in various counties have already implemented labor service one after another, the overall labor conscription for all agencies, armies, schools, and people in the province has not yet been implemented. Therefore, the Construction Department was instructed to formulate the "Gansu Province 24th Year Winter Labor Conscription Plan," which consists of seven items, and stipulates that the period from November 1, 1935, to the end of March 1936 shall be the labor conscription period. It is heard that it has been reported to the Executive Yuan and sent to the Garrison Commander of Gansu and Suiyuan and the Second Route Army Headquarters for compliance.

<h3 id="e72">Guangdong Province Rectifies Salt Affairs <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Salt Tax Revenue Shrinking Year by Year, Improving Salt Production, Constructing Central Warehouse, Newly Setting Salt Catty Distribution and Transportation Methods</p>
<p>Guangdong Correspondence, Guangdong Province borders the sea, and the South Road and Dongjiang both produce a large amount of salt catties. In the past, in addition to supplying this province, it was also sold to the provinces of Guangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Jiangxi. However, in recent years, sales have decreased greatly. The reason is that Guangxi Province has the adulteration of Vietnamese sea salt, and the Hunan market is monopolized by Huai salt. Only the borders of Fujian and Jiangxi still have some sales markets, but they are far less than in the past. It is found that the total revenue of Guangdong salt tax in 1933 was more than 13 million, only 10 million in 1934, and only more than 9.2 million last year (1935). Judging from this situation, there is a trend of shrinking year by year. Recently, the Guangdong Salt Affairs Audit Office and the Liangguang Salt Transportation Envoy Office have urgently planned relief methods to improve the production and transportation of salt catties. On the one hand, technical experts are hired to go to various salt fields to guide the improvement of salt drying methods, and on the other hand, in order to facilitate transportation, a salt storage central warehouse is being built near the Yuehan Railway in Huangsha, Guangzhou, with a project cost of 200,000 yuan. In the future, if it is completed, salt boats from various places can directly transport the central warehouse in the province for storage, which can save the past suffering of transshipment and storage. In addition, in order to rectify the transportation and sales of salt catties, the Liangguang Salt Transportation Envoy Office has recently formulated temporary measures for the distribution and transportation of salt catties in various fields, which will be announced and implemented starting this month, and the implementation period is temporarily set at six months. The methods are as follows: The purpose of this method is to maintain the 37% transportation quota, adjust the production and sales methods of various fields, abolish the method of stamping and receiving process certificates from the guild, allow each merchant to freely report and transport according to the quota, in order to facilitate handling and avoid disputes. The stipulation of the 37% transportation quota is temporarily based on the average number of actual sales in the province in the past five years. The salt fields in the east and west account for 70%, and the salt fields in Leiqiong account for 30%. Each merchant is allowed to freely report and transport within the quota, but the annual standard total quota is still divided into four phases, and the total number of distributions and transportations for each merchant in each phase must not exceed the fixed quota for that phase, and the actual distribution number to the field must not exceed 10% of the distribution number filled in the process certificate, in order to prevent the malpractice of excessive transportation and congestion, and the government can still change the handling according to the needs of the sales market at any time. The standard quota is determined in another table. Each merchant can freely receive and transport salt at the beginning of each phase of salt transportation. However, for Leiqiong salt catties, each merchant can freely report the number of distributions and transportations first, and after ten days, the number of reports and transportations from each merchant will be summarized and then issued a water process certificate separately, but it is stipulated that if the total number of reports and transportations from each merchant at the same time exceeds the fixed quota for that phase, the total number can be converted separately according to the number of reports and transportations from each merchant, and each merchant will be informed separately and allowed to freely assemble and transport in rotation and jointly report to receive the water process certificate. Those with a small number that are not easy to assemble and transport are allowed to hire sailboats for towing. After the transportation quota is allocated, if there are those who do not receive the process certificate for distribution and transportation, the government can consider the number of Leiqiong salt in the province and temporarily change the unfulfilled transportation quota to the second one who receives the process certificate for transportation in order to take care of the sales market. For the distribution and transportation of Leiqiong salt catties, the validity period of the process certificate and the date of reporting and transportation have been slightly less strictly regulated in the past, and it is inevitable that there are malpractices such as delaying reporting and distribution after receiving the process certificate. Additional regulations should be added: all transport ships must report to the field for transportation and distribution within 15 days after receiving the process certificate, and return to the province within 8 days; sailboats must complete the distribution within 30 days and return to the province within 20 days. If the problem is not declared and the deadline is exceeded, the process certificate will be cancelled, and the loss will be borne by the merchant himself, and those who have distributed salt will still be investigated and punished according to regulations, in order to take measures. During the distribution period of the 37% fixed quota, the transportation halls in the east and west fields are not restricted from being freely established, but the transportation halls in Leiqiong are restricted from increasing. This is a temporary expedient measure. Now, in order to publicly tow and avoid involving patents, all merchants who want to establish new Leiqiong transportation halls are allowed to freely report and handle the matter according to the regulations without adding restrictions, but in order to stabilize the business of existing Leiqiong transporters, after the new merchant is approved to establish a hall, the newly established hall cannot occupy the right to transport salt in the current 30% transportation quota, and must wait until the next 30% transportation quota begins before participating in receiving the process certificate for salt transportation in order to maintain order and avoid patents. The method of stopping ships in the east and west salt fields is abolished, and it is related to the self-interest of the east field merchants, so the east and west field merchants are allowed to freely gather to discuss and resolve the matter and report for approval. Leiqiong transporters do not need to invest in purchasing process ships to establish transportation halls, and their qualifications for transporting salt are very different from those of east and west field transporters, who must purchase several large process ships as a guarantee before they can establish halls for salt transportation. The burdens are also different. Currently, the construction of Leiqiong salt warehouses in the province's rivers requires a lot of money, which cannot be raised. It is planned to collect 5 cents per package of Leiqiong salt catties reported for transportation as a fee for building Leiqiong salt warehouses. All Leiqiong salt catties distributed for transportation should be handed over to the accounting office of this office for verification and collection at the time of receiving the process certificate according to the number of salt transported, and a receipt will be given. When the salt ship returns to the province, after clearing the warehouse, the actual number of distributions will be verified and the amount will be supplemented accordingly. This method is temporarily drafted and will be implemented on a trial basis for six months. It should be abolished or continued to be handled at the time of expiration. If there are any matters that are not exhausted in this method, and there are any changes that should be made, this office will consider and approve them at any time. (February 3)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Joint Suppression of Bandits on the Border by Troops Stationed in Fujian, Guangdong, and Zhejiang <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Recent Bandit Situation in Eastern and Western Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence, A large number of bandits have recently been discovered in the Taishun and Qingyuan areas of western Zhejiang, with a total of 500 to 600 people and 500 to 600 guns. They come and go unpredictably, harming the local area. After being suppressed by Zhejiang Province, they fled to the Fuding and Xiapu areas of eastern Fujian. They are now harassing the border between Fujian and Zhejiang. In order to fundamentally eliminate them, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has sent a telegram to the Fujian Provincial Government requesting an increase in the military strength in the area, and the troops stationed in Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces will implement encirclement and suppression to avoid this suppression and that escape. After receiving the telegram, the Fujian Provincial Government immediately increased the number of security regiments and sent them to jointly suppress the bandits. It is found that the bandits on the border of Fuding and Xiapu are scattered in all directions after being defeated. According to investigations in the past week, in the Zhou Dun area, one is a wandering bandit from outside, this bandit is the department of Ye Fei, the pseudo-Special Committee Chairman, with more than 200 people, its strength has more than 100 rifles, one heavy machine gun, and one submachine gun, and its actions are very secret and rapid, and its movement is uncertain; the second is a local bandit, this bandit is composed of local unemployed people, and the bandit leader is Ling Fushun, etc., with 60 to 70 people, scattered in various townships, its strength has more than 30 rifles and more than 10 pistols, and its actions are in groups of three or five, specializing in killing and kidnapping tickets. Chen Kun, the commander of the 8th Security Regiment stationed in Zhou Dun, is tracking and suppressing the bandits, and has convened a meeting of villagers, with more than 200 people attending, and Chen Yanlian, the squadron leader, spoke about the harm of being a bandit and the meaning of cooperation between the army and the people, in order to publicize.</p>
<p>The bandit situation on the border between western Fujian and eastern Guangdong has recently become rampant again. The military authorities of Fujian and Guangdong Provinces have decided on joint suppression measures, which will be implemented from February 1 and cleared within a short period of time. It is learned that the initial joint suppression by the Fujian and Guangdong armies is to first annihilate the communists in Zhao'an.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Overview of the World's Five Strongest Economies Last Year <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Translation should be done.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>The economic situation in England in 1935 showed a significant improvement compared to the previous year. However, many industrial sectors were still far from reaching the levels of 1929 (before the economic crisis). There were anxieties in many areas of the economic world regarding the prospects for the future, especially from the perspective of the international situation. The influential Midland Bank published a monthly report stating that the world situation was creating a bad atmosphere, which would hinder future economic improvement.</p>
<p>Official figures released by the Department of Commerce showed an increase in foreign trade and shipping. Steel production had made significant progress, which corresponded to the demands of the heavy industry protected by high tariffs over the past three years for major transformations, and also met the needs of the war industry.</p>
<p>On the other hand, coal exports fell between July and September last year compared to the same period in 1934, and in October fell from 3,630,000 tons (1934) to 3,290,000 tons (1935). According to the newly published "Economist", exports of manufactured goods and railway freight fell sharply in November, partly due to sanctions against Italy. The electricity consumption index, which has always been regarded as a barometer of the UK's industrial prosperity, showed a decline in the last few months of last year. The index for October 1934 was 103.1, but in October 1935 it fell to 90.5.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, workers in many industrial sectors in the UK demanded wage increases, most notably in the mining and textile industries. In the first eleven months, there were a total of 551 labor disputes in industry last year, an increase of about a quarter compared to 442 in 1934, while the number of workers involved in these conflicts increased from 119,000 to 267,000, more than doubling.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>In 1935, the total industrial production in the United States increased by 10%, but it was still 30% below the level of 1929. According to official figures, the total agricultural income in 1935 was only 7.8 billion US dollars, which was far from the 11 billion US dollars in 1929.</p>
<p>Many daily newspapers and magazines stated that the economic improvement was not stable, and that new disputes might occur in 1936, affecting all important sectors of industry. For example, the December issue of the National City Bank Bulletin stated that the United States was facing some unfavorable economic factors, and that industry and commerce in 1936 might fall into stagnation.</p>
<p>The unemployment figures in the United States are still very high. According to various surveys, there are at least 11 million, and according to the Hamilton Society's calculations, there are as many as 13 million. Wages have remained at previous low levels, while food prices and rents have increased by almost 10% in 1935.</p>
<p>According to official figures released in 1935, although the government subsidized farmers to reduce cultivated land, 1935 was a year of deepening poverty for most farmers. In every thousand households, twenty-one had their properties auctioned off for debt, and more than seven had their properties auctioned off for unpaid taxes. According to statistics, 300,000 tenant farmers in the southern states had no land to cultivate due to the reduction of cotton fields.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Frenzied war preparation and severe food shortages—these two points are most noteworthy when examining Germany's economic position in 1935.</p>
<p>The war industry has developed greatly, but the production of consumer goods manufacturing industry has declined.</p>
<p>The status of agriculture does not seem to have improved much. Although grain production was higher than in 1934, it was still lower than the average annual production of the past five years. The harvest of sweet potatoes fell from 46.7 million tons in 1934 to 39.5 million tons in 1935.</p>
<p>The livestock industry has been hit hard. Originally, Germany's foreign exchange reserves were largely used for the import of raw materials for the war industry, so the import of feed was inevitably reduced.</p>
<p>Germany faced a painful financial situation in 1936. The national debt has accumulated to more than 40 billion marks. The Minister of Finance has publicly announced that in order to meet the needs of the war budget, it is necessary to collect the "last copper coin" from the people.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign trade, last year was also an unfortunate year for Fascist Germany. Although export trade was relatively stable compared to 1934 (based on the index from January to October), import trade was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>German fascist newspapers also inevitably revealed the fact that the cost of living has increased greatly. Advertisements in large stores indicated that prices had increased by 40% to 60% in one year.</p>
<p>Unemployment has increased dramatically. Even the Fascist newspapers, whose calculations should be discounted, published unemployment figures of nearly two million. In fact, the number of unemployed people is far greater than that number.</p>
<p>The most obvious manifestation of the poverty of the German masses is the high rise in the mortality rate. The mortality rate in 1934 was 10.9 per thousand, while in 1935 it reached 13.7 per thousand. In several large cities, there was a record of 2,715 suicides in three months. In Berlin alone, five or six people commit suicide every day.</p>
<p>In addition to suicide, many people also died for political reasons. Since the Nazi Party came to power, a total of 48,701 anti-fascists have been killed. There were a total of 5,425 anti-fascist cases. 21,000 people were sentenced to a total of 39,792 years in prison. If the prison terms of all political prisoners in concentration camps are added, it will total about 100,000 years.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Italy was in a very tense atmosphere as a result of the war against Abyssinia. Italy encountered great difficulties both on the military front and at home, which even its own newspapers did not want to hide.</p>
<p>Italy went through many years of bad luck, carried out the war against Abyssinia, and the implementation of international sanctions closed many markets to Italian exports, so the economic crisis was of course even more serious. In order to meet the needs of the war, the industry was reorganized, and as a result, the production of heavy industry has increased greatly in recent months. In July 1934, the machinery construction index exceeded the level of 1929 by 5% and the level of 1934 by 36%. The production of the automobile industry increased by 25% compared to the figures in 1929. Steel production has also increased significantly. In the first seven months of 1935, the total iron production was 336,000 tons, while in the same period in 1934 it was only 299,000 tons, and steel production also increased in the same period.</p>
<p>During the same period, despite the amazing increase in the production of those industrial sectors that adapted to military needs, the industrial production index fell significantly in the summer months of 1935. In July 1935, it decreased by 15% compared to 1929 and by 20% compared to May 1925.</p>
<p>This decline was due to the great decline of the manufacturing industry. The textile industry was particularly hit hard. In July 1935, the silk industry index was only 9.5, while in July 1934 it was 50.6 (taking 1929 as 100%). The agriculture, which was greatly affected by the sanctions, also had the same situation. More than half of Italy's exported fruits could not be shipped to the countries that imposed sanctions. Wine exports decreased by a quarter. The war forced the Italian government to use all the available currency and gold reserves, which has had a profound impact on finance.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>In 1935, Japan's national economy as a whole became more concentrated to meet the needs of the so-called "emergency"—or the preparation for "great war". Therefore, the budget for 1936-37 was again a purely military budget. Among the total national expenditure of 2.27 billion yen, more than half was spent by the Army and Navy, along with nine other items related to war needs. At the same time, the funds allocated to agriculture, which was considered to be in a critical situation, were further reduced.</p>
<p>Therefore, in 1935, Japan's industry showed a remarkable one-sided prosperity. Those industries that supplied military needs made progress, while other industrial sectors, especially those that supplied consumer goods, lagged far behind.</p>
<p>Japan is now facing a severe financial difficulty. The unsold government bonds held by the Bank of Japan amounted to a huge amount of 320 million yen. This led to the largest inflation since 1927. Compared with 1.763 billion yen at the end of 1934, the total amount of banknotes in circulation now exceeds 2 billion yen.</p>
<p>Accompanying this so-called "one-sided prosperity" of Japan is the gradual decline in the living standards of workers and farmers. Wages are gradually falling, while the cost of living is rising. Taking the wage index in 1934 as 100, the index in October 1935 was 81, lower than 82.6 in October 1934. At the same time, taking the retail price index in 1934 as 100, December 1935 was 155.6, while December 1934 was 150. These are just average figures. In fact, the prices of goods consumed by the masses have risen even more sharply. For example, the price index for food rose from 150 in December 1934 to 233 in December of the previous year, while clothing rose from 149 to 183.</p>

<p>Bandit Yu Dingren, Zhang Changshui, and others formed a gang. These bandits roamed and harassed the border areas of Fujian and Guangdong without a fixed location. Now that the government troops are about to launch a large-scale campaign to suppress them, the bandits know that it will be difficult to resist and are likely to collapse towards the Yunxiao area. They had a fierce encounter with the Fujian and Guangdong troops a few days ago, resulting in more than ten bandits being killed and more than ten rifles being seized. In addition, when Guangdong Province handled the rural pacification a few years ago, the Communist bandits who gathered in Raoping were driven into the Zhao'an County area. The bandit leader was Wu Jin, a native of Qiongzhou. In July of last year, under the order of the pseudo-Southwest Fujian Military Region, he sneaked into the sixth district of the county and incorporated the bandit gangs of Yu Dingren, Yu Qitou, and Yu Hongmao. He called himself the Political Commissar of the Zhao Yunlong Red Army Command. Now, the various bandit gangs have been reorganized into the Zhao'an Battalion, Pinghe Battalion, and Yunxiao Battalion, and a pseudo-command post has been set up in Pingshui Camp, engaging in robbery and looting every day. Among the bandits, Yu Qitou is the most fierce and has resisted the government troops several times. At present, the men in the villages occupied by the bandits have been organized into the Red Guards, and the women have been organized into the porter teams. When the bandits first came, they extorted ransoms only from a small number of people with assets, but recently, the middle class has also been implicated. Therefore, those families who were able to support themselves have all moved to the urban areas or safer areas.</p>

<h3 id="e75">The Occurrence and Prevention of Disease (Part 1) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Baoshan, Technical Officer of the Department of Health</p>
<p>Gentlemen: The topic I am going to talk about is "The Occurrence and Prevention of Disease." Disease is the enemy of mankind and the evil of society. Therefore, we have a common saying: "Peace is a blessing, and being free from disease is like being a little immortal." However, as human reproduction increases and material civilization evolves, the causes of disease become more complex, and the chances of human health being taken away also increase. The more developed the metropolis, the more dangerous human life becomes. Because of the convenience of transportation and the same source of food and drink, all increase the chances of disease. Taking infectious diseases as an example, in the past few decades, almost every country in the world had epidemics of infectious diseases every year. Once a disease was discovered, it was like a flood or a wild beast. I don't know how many people died of disease every year, and the economic losses suffered by society due to disease were naturally very large. Therefore, if we want to seek happiness for mankind and society, we must first find a way to eliminate disease. This is very obvious. If we want to eliminate disease, we must first understand the causes of disease, and then study methods to prevent disease, and then study them. Otherwise, this "disease" will never be eradicated.</p>
<p>Today, let us first briefly discuss the question of "the occurrence of disease."</p>
<p>As human knowledge progresses, the concept of disease has gradually developed. From a historical perspective, there were legends in the Neolithic Age of drilling open skulls to release ghosts, and this is still done among the aborigines of northern Africa today. Because they believe that symptoms such as headaches and convulsions are caused by ghosts and demons in the head. Since they have no ability to understand the disease, they will naturally develop a fearful mentality and lead to superstitious ideas. In our so-called ancient civilization of China, disease and death are also believed to be in the hands of the masters in the underworld, so temples are built and monks and Taoists are followed in the hope of eradicating disease. In this way, it has been going on for thousands of years, and to this day, its remaining embers still exist, so most people still do not have a proper concept of the occurrence of disease.</p>
<p>It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that people gradually began to seek the causes of human disease and the location of the onset. By dissecting corpses, the discovered abnormalities were compared with the symptoms before death, and various methods were used to examine the patient's blood and excrement. Later, in the late nineteenth century, Pasteur overturned various fallacies through years of research and experience and discovered evidence of microbial disease, opening a new era in the history of medicine. As a result, human beings naturally changed their concept of disease. Only then did they realize that disease is a physiological abnormality, which is caused by our violation of the normal laws of physiology.</p>
<p>Modern medicine is still in its infancy, but the gloomy and dark era has passed. Although many diseases are still unclear about their origin, they have broken free from the shackles of vague metaphysics and entered the right track, and have obtained the right laws. One is to seek the truth of science through experimentation. According to modern medical knowledge, we know that there are many types of human diseases, and the causes of disease are extremely complex. These causes can be generally divided into two types. One type is called "external causes," which are caused by external effects on the body or by external invasion into the body. The other type is called "internal causes," which have been latent in the body from the beginning and are attached to body tissues. However, remember that the same cause can cause various diseases, and several causes can also jointly cause one type of disease. Now, let us explain these causes one by one, and we will naturally be able to understand the occurrence of disease.</p>
<p>Internal Causes: Simply put, the internal cause of disease is the human body's susceptibility to disease, so it can also be called the underlying cause of disease. Each of us has a different reaction to external stimuli. For example, a drinker can drink a lot of alcohol without getting drunk, while a person who is not used to drinking will become unconscious even if they smell alcohol. The same is true for diseases. For example, if a certain infectious disease occurs in a family, not everyone in the family will be infected and get sick. This is because there is a difference in the strength of resistance to disease, and the ease of infection is different. Resistance is medically called immunity. This immunity can generally be divided into two types: natural and acquired. Natural immunity is because of the difference in animal species, and the degree of infection with the same pathogen is different, such as the human body not being infected with cowpox. Acquired immunity is acquired after birth, such as after suffering from smallpox, the body develops immunity and can be guaranteed to never be infected again. Or use artificial methods to generate immunity, such as vaccinating with cowpox to prevent smallpox. In addition, "constitution" also has an important relationship with the occurrence of disease. Constitution is the sum of various conditions of an individual's morphology and function. If we want to have a normal life—health—we must first have a normal constitution. If the balance of life is easily lost and turns into a morbid state, that constitution is called a weak constitution—that is, it has an underlying cause of disease. The strength of the constitution is mostly directly related to our living environment and personal behavior. Whenever a part of the tissue or organ in the body has an underlying cause of disease and shows a physiological disorder, it can affect other parts, because there is a very close relationship between the various organs and systems in the body. The function of the endocrine glands is most closely related to the individual's constitution. Endocrine glands are organs that secrete certain chemical substances and directly enter the bloodstream. This substance is called a hormone, which can regulate the body's metabolism. There is also mutual connection between the various endocrine glands. Obstacles in one gland can affect other glands, so diseases caused by endocrine gland dysfunction are often very complex. "Diabetes" is an example of abnormal endocrine function. Most of these patients have an underlying cause of this disease—that is, a diabetic constitution. There have been cases in medical records of families with the disease. At the same time, it is also closely related to personal living habits. In European and American countries, the incidence of this disease is clearly increasing, which is caused by the increased amount of sugar food. There are many causes and types of diabetes, but the most common is a type caused by dysfunction of a special endocrine function in the pancreas. The occurrence of this disease can involve other organs and endocrine glands, such as the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal gland, liver, kidneys, etc. Its most obvious symptoms are thirst, easy hunger, increased urine output, and containing a large amount of sugar, the body is initially relatively obese, and then gradually becomes thin, the skin is itchy, and the starchy and sugary foods eaten are digested and absorbed into the blood, and then excreted through the urine, unable to supply the body's use. This is a result of the dysfunction of the secretory function in the pancreas, which affects the abnormal metabolism of sugars and starches. The most important thing in treatment is to pay attention to health preservation and control diet. Although there is now a special drug called "insulin" available, it is still not possible to seek a radical cure. This is a type of disease caused by the body's "internal causes." Let us now discuss the external causes of disease.</p>
<p>External Causes: Diseases that are caused by external stimuli are collectively called "external causes." From our daily observations, we can see that the occurrence of diseases is closely related to occupations, customs, habits, and living conditions. Climate, clothing, food, and housing also have a considerable relationship. Among them, the problem of "food" is the most important. Because the metabolism of substances and energy continues during the life of living things, and its driving force is obtained from nutrients, it goes without saying that obstacles to the supply of nutrients can endanger health and life. Nutritional disorders or deficiencies can not only directly cause disease, but also weaken the constitution and induce other diseases. In terms of physics, there are external causes of disease, such as mechanical stimuli—trauma; thermal stimuli—excessive cold or heat; air pressure, light, electric shock, etc., which can indirectly or directly cause people to become ill. In terms of chemistry, there are various poisoning situations with local and systemic effects, such as strong acids, strong alkalis, toxic gases, morphine, drugs, arsenic, phosphorus, aluminum, etc., which can directly or indirectly damage human health. In addition, the most important external causes of disease are two categories: parasites and germs. An animal that parasitizes on the body or internal organs of another animal and takes its nutrient solution for development and reproduction is called a parasite. There are many types of parasites that can cause human disease. The most common in our country are the amoeba dysenteriae that causes dysentery, the malaria protozoa, hookworms, schistosomiasis, flukes, roundworms, lung flukes, liver flukes, tapeworms, filarial worms that cause elephantiasis, etc. These parasites indirectly enter the skin through insect vectors or directly, or are excreted in feces, and then enter the digestive tract through food, directly entering the internal organs—living in the intestines, lying in the lungs, living in the liver, or swimming in the blood. They breed and reproduce, taking the human body's nutrient solution, destroying blood vessels, or other tissues, producing toxins, or blocking ducts, and causing various physiological disorders. In this way, one person spreads and infects others, harming society and the population greatly. This type of disease is collectively called "infectious diseases" because it is infectious. Among the pathogens of infectious diseases, in addition to the above-mentioned parasites, there are two types of small organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye, called germs, and filterable viruses. Filterable viruses are extremely small and can be filtered through filters, with no form to speak of. Germs can be divided into three major categories according to their morphology, usually seen under a microscope, such as spherical ones, called cocci, rod-shaped ones called bacilli, and spiral-shaped ones called spirochetes. Each type of filterable virus or bacteria can cause a disease. Therefore, their pathogenic effects vary according to their type. Some can directly destroy tissues, and some can produce toxins. Those within the bacteria are called endotoxins, and some can produce exotoxins, which are spread throughout the body through the blood and poison body tissues. The most obvious method of infection is direct contact with the patient, which is called direct infection or contact infection. Indirect infection is caused by attachment to other objects or people and then transmission to others; some are transmitted through insect food or water media. In addition to this, there is another mode of transmission that deserves the most attention, which is the problem of carriers and shedders. A carrier appears to be healthy on the outside but does carry germs in the body and can excrete them at any time, causing others to become infected. Shedders are those who have contracted a certain infectious disease and are still shedding germs. Both of these types of people are easily overlooked, so the danger is extremely high. Now, let's give a few of the most common infectious disease examples to show the pathways of invasion into the human body: (1) Invasive through the mouth, such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever; (2) Invasive through the nasopharynx, such as diphtheria, scarlet fever; (3) Invasive through skin wounds, such as tetanus, erysipelas; (4) Invasive through the respiratory organs, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, influenza. But what we should understand is that after germs invade the human body, infectious diseases do not necessarily occur, because the occurrence of disease is a result of our body's defenses succumbing to the invading germs. Therefore, an infectious disease must follow certain "requirements" in order to occur. These requirements are: 1. The body's health disappears or decreases to a certain degree; 2. The body's immunity is weak; 3. The invasiveness of the germs is strong; 4. The toxicity of the germs has a certain strength; 5. The number of invading germs has reached the minimum required for the onset of the disease; 6. The site where the germs invade is suitable for the growth of the bacteria, so they can reproduce rapidly. For example, pulmonary tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the invasion of tubercle bacilli from outside the body into the human body. In our unsanitary environment, there are really many opportunities to contact these bacteria, but not every contact or all people who have contact must develop pulmonary tuberculosis, because the situation does not meet the above "requirements." This disease does not occur. Conversely, if a person is born with a tuberculosis constitution, or their health is reduced due to living against natural principles, and the body's resistance is weak, and at the same time the invasiveness of the germs is strong and the toxicity is severe, then when the number of germs gathered in the lungs increases to a considerable amount, it will immediately break out and begin to destroy the lung tissue, causing tuberculous pathological changes, poisoning the whole body, resulting in mental weakness, constant fatigue, decreased appetite, night sweats, cough, fever in the afternoon, blood in the sputum or hemoptysis, emaciation, etc. In short, all diseases, whether infectious or not, must be caused by the mutual response of the above-mentioned internal and external causes in order to produce the phenomenon of disease. This is the general outline of the occurrence of disease. As for how to prevent disease, we will continue to discuss it next time.</p>

<p>The home of Cao Guoping and Cao Jingxian, households 90, Jia 13, Bao 4, Hanxu Township, Tinglin, in the seventh district of the county, was suddenly attacked by more than 20 bandits on the night of the 5th. They spoke in local accents and broke into the house through the right side door. The robbery lasted for about two hours before they escaped through the main gate, losing banknotes, gold jewelry, jade, clothes, and other items. The case was reported by the first branch bureau to the county bureau, requesting investigation of the stolen goods and arrest of the robbers. Before leaving, the robbers left behind a hammer, a broken umbrella, and two洋燭. The first branch bureau has dispatched police to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Assassination of a Suspended Detective in Taicang <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Fengqi, the former captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau of Taicang County, was in his teens and was from Jinan Prefecture, Shandong Province. He had served as a detective in the ice and land police team. Gan Zhuo, the director of the Qian County Public Security Bureau, promoted Zhang to captain, who performed his duties diligently. Later, the Shuangfeng Chen Ajin murder case occurred, and the case expanded. Zhang was suspended from his post and imprisoned on suspicion of a certain matter. After serving his sentence for several years, he was released and unemployed. He rented a house outside Xiaobeimen. At about 2 a.m. on the 7th, more than a dozen thugs suddenly came, tore open the back door and entered. Zhang was awakened from his sleep and was about to put on his clothes and get up to investigate when the thugs shone a flashlight on him and immediately shot Zhang with a prepared pistol. All three bullets hit his head, killing him instantly. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, roared away. After the incident, Zhang's son reported to the county government. At about 3 p.m., county commissioner Shen Chengzai and others arrived at the scene to inspect the body and ordered the arrest of the murderers.</p>

<p>At about 2 p.m. on the 7th, the Shanghai-Nanjing express train arrived and stopped at Changzhou Station. A young passenger got off the train carrying a suitcase and hired a羊頭small car, stating that he wanted to go to Guotangqiao Town for a fare of six dimes. The driver loaded the passenger and drove. Near the Luo Wu Bridge on Guanhe Road, the passenger suddenly fell out of the car and was found to be dead. The driver was terrified and fled with the car. Later, a passerby, Cao, reported to the fifth police station of the Public Security Bureau, which requested the local court to send someone to inspect the body. Prosecutor Yang and an official went to inspect the body. The deceased was found to be in his twenties, with an old injury on his back that had occurred a week earlier, still covered with plaster. The death was determined to be caused by气厥due to the old injury, resulting in the fall and death. The belongings were examined, and many business cards of Gao Zhijing were found. The belongings were taken to the court for storage and awaiting collection. The corpse was ordered to be placed in a coffin by the town chief Huang Yaozhong.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Police Officer Flees with Gun in Jiaxing, No Trace <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>

After the brigade discovered this, Gui Sheng (Chen Zhenwen's brother and guarantor) was arrested and detained at the first branch bureau. Yesterday, Gui Sheng was released on bail and ordered to find his brother and hand him over to the authorities for punishment.</p>

<p>The Daxin Zhenji Cotton Weaving Factory on South Main Street in this city is owned by Lu Xinquan. Lu himself works at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Hotel, and the factory is managed by his son, Zengxiang. Zengxiang is 22 years old. He previously fell in love with a female worker, Yuan Xiuzhen, and had a physical relationship. She became pregnant, and they agreed to become a formal couple. They had gone to Shanghai to register for a group wedding but failed. Recently, Yuan's abdomen gradually became enlarged. Zengxiang asked his father to marry them immediately. Xin Quan said that he could not raise the money temporarily and agreed to hold the wedding for them in mid-April. Zengxiang, anxious because Yuan was about to give birth and the wedding could not be delayed, argued with his father without result. On the morning of the 7th, Xin Quan went directly to Shanghai. Zengxiang, impatient, suddenly had a suicidal thought. He secretly tied a cotton rope around his neck and hanged himself on a nail on the wall of the room. When his mother called him for lunch and he did not respond, she entered the room and found him. She quickly asked Dr. Xu Pingshu to come for treatment, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Since the turbulence in the iron trade in this port last year, the business of various banks has been tightened, and loans have been tightened. The city's finances are no longer as active as in the past. Although the opening date of this month has been decided as the 16th, the business policy after that has not yet been unified. According to people in the industry, there will inevitably be many restrictions on value-added loans. The entire business policy will ultimately be based on the word "cautious" in lending. There should be a clear statement before the market opens.</p>

<p>Northern Shipping Route Restored / Shanghai Steamer Sailing Today</p>
<p>The ice layer outside Dagu Port has been broken by Japanese icebreakers transferred from the Grand Canal, forming a航路. The Taikoo Company's Shuntian steamer was the first to sail out of the ice layer and head south to Shanghai. The Zhengji Fengli steamer received this telegram yesterday and rushed to Tianjin this morning. Taikoo also sent the Henan steamer to load goods in Shanghai and scheduled to resume sailing to Tianjin today. Dagu, Tianjin, has been frozen for three weeks. Today, the resumption of shipping is celebrated by all shipping companies.</p>

<p>Rescue Under Discussion</p>
<p>The Tongshun steamer of the Datong Xing Shipping Company in this port has a deadweight of 2,346 tons, a length of 298 feet, a width of 40 feet 3 inches, a depth of 21 feet 6 inches, and a draft of 20 feet. The steamer was built in 1896 and was built in England. Originally running between Shanghai and various ports in the north and south, the company decided to sail to Hongji to load coal and return to China. Unexpectedly, it encountered fog and had an accident on the way, and the situation was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Encountering Fog and Running Aground</p>
<p>According to the Datong Xing Company in Shanghai, it received a telegram from the owner of the Tongshun steamer stating that the Tongshun steamer was heading from Shanghai to Hongji and was sailing in the waters of Hainan Island when it encountered heavy fog. Navigation was difficult. At that time, the steamer mistakenly sailed onto a reef near Hainan Island in the heavy fog. The ship's hull immediately ran aground and broke the bow cabin, causing the first cabin to be flooded. The current situation is very difficult.</p>
<p>Emergency Telegram for Help</p>
<p>At that time, the shipowner was unable to move the ship's body, and the bow cabin was flooded, making it difficult to escape danger. He urgently sent a wireless telegram to report to the Shanghai headquarters, requesting rescue. After receiving the report, the company copied the original telegram to the United China Shipping Insurance Association, which insured the ship, and discussed rescue measures with Mr. Tang Danhua. It is now known that a steamer will be sent from Shanghai to Hainan Island for rescue. On the one hand, the company will first send a telegram to the owner of the Tongshun steamer to wait for rescue.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Police Academy, in order to cultivate high-level police administration talent, upon the graduation of its first class of students, selected those who excelled in both character and academics to be sent to Germany, Austria, Japan, and other countries at public expense to study police science. After these students returned to China, they contributed greatly to the improvement of political and police affairs. The school authorities, therefore, selected Huang You, Wang Weizhou, Chen Yisheng, Feng Wenyao, and four other people from the third graduating class to study in Germany. Huang and the others originally planned to go abroad last autumn. However, Zhao Longwen, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Capital, in order to rectify Hangzhou's police administration, specially obtained the consent of the Police Academy to stay and serve in the Zhejiang Provincial Capital for several months. Now that the winter defense is about to end, it has been decided to go abroad immediately. Huang and others left Hangzhou on the 1st of this month. Zhao Longwen, the chief of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, Hu Guozhen, the chief inspector, all instructors, students, and staff of the Inspectorate and Police Academy, and relatives and friends of Huang and others, all went to the station to see them off, making for a grand occasion. After Huang and the others arrived in Shanghai, they stayed at the Yipinxiang Hotel. A few days ago, they went to Beijing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to complete the formalities for going abroad, and to the Training Directorate-General to listen to instructions. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The first batch, Huang You, Wang Weizhou, and others, took the French postal ship "Sphinx" yesterday. Many relatives and friends went to the Gonghexiang Wharf to see them off. The second batch will also sail on the 21st after completing all the formalities. It is said that Huang and the others are talented and virtuous, and have new ideas. This trip to Germany to seek further education will surely make a contribution to the police administration cause of the motherland when they return home in the future.</p>

<p>On the Condition of Receiving the Same Treatment as Chinese Businesses</p>
<p>According to the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," although the National Government has not yet implemented the Factory Law since its promulgation, it is reported that it will soon be applied to factories run by foreign merchants as well. The Shanghai Japanese Textile Trade Association held a special committee meeting at the Japanese Club on the afternoon of the 7th to discuss countermeasures. All agreed that regarding the limit on the number of personnel used in factories, Japanese small and medium-sized industrialists advocate implementing it in factories with more than 50 people. On the other hand, regarding regulations on working hours, the age of child laborers, wages, and the payment of unified taxes, they are willing to accept the same regulations as Chinese businesses, but only if they are first implemented in Chinese businesses' factories. As for the unified tax, Japanese textile businesses have already paid it in full. In short, as long as there is no differential treatment compared to Chinese factories, Japanese businesses have no objections.</p>

<p>After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Xia Yingtang first reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying, "Comrades, our branch is holding a meeting today to celebrate the promulgation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations. I am very grateful for your participation. I would like to express my thanks, and say a few words to you. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations were passed by the Legislative Yuan on December 15th, 1933, and were delayed for various reasons until January 22nd of this year before being promulgated by the government. The success of a matter must involve many difficulties and cannot be achieved overnight. Our comrades have gone through much hardship in petitioning for these regulations over the past years. Even our branch has made some small contributions. Now, thanks to the government's wise decision, we can achieve our wishes. From now on, our national medicine will have a legal basis. This is truly a joyous thing. The significance of our celebration is very profound. Our branch is a government agency. Although Yingtang and others are serving in it, they are also members of the traditional Chinese medicine community. In this moment of celebration, due to the limited time, I will not say much, but I will briefly state two points that I feel, and I would like to share them with you all: Do not forget the difficulties of the past, and strive for greater progress in the future. This is just a general outline. As for the detailed methods, there are countless things to do, and it is difficult to express them all in one sentence. I hope that all comrades will contact and work together with our branch to move forward in unison. I am extremely hopeful."</p>
<p>Representative Speeches</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, Zhang Zanchen, the representative of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, gave a speech, saying that in order to give traditional Chinese medicine a legal status in the country, the traditional Chinese medicine community had made many efforts to petition the government to promulgate the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations. Now that these regulations have been promulgated, it is indeed something worth celebrating for our medical community. However, in the future, we should work harder to improve the academic aspects of traditional Chinese medicine, so as to raise the status of traditional Chinese medicine and enhance the belief of the general public. Gong Xingzhai, the representative of the Shenzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, said that the promulgation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations is indeed something that we should celebrate enthusiastically. However, the responsibility of traditional Chinese medicine is even greater from now on. In the future, we should promote the special techniques of traditional Chinese medicine and strengthen the organization of the traditional Chinese medicine community so that the status of traditional Chinese medicine will be further consolidated. He Yunsheng and other representatives of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Society gave speeches, with similar meanings, which are omitted. After the speeches, refreshments were served, a group photo was taken, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>After Consultation Between the Money Trade Association and the Banking Association</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Banks Association abolished the custom of money shops charging banks a bill of exchange fee, the Money Trade Association believed that charging each other bill of exchange fees had become a custom, and Article 10 of the industry rules stipulated that "the minimum bill of exchange fee is one dime per thousand yuan." Therefore, the association sent commissioners Pei Yunqing and Xi Jiming to consult with Mr. Maile, manager of the McGary Bank and president of the Foreign Exchange Banks Association (i.e., the Foreign Banks Association). An agreement has now been reached to maintain the status quo and charge each other bill of exchange fees according to custom.</p>

<p>The Municipal Federation Sent a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeking Opinions, and the District Councils Sent Letters Requesting the Convening of a Taxpayer Meeting, and Users Contributed Opinions to the Telephone Issues Committee</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the First Special District Citizens' Association of this city and the Citizens' Branch Associations of various districts, dissatisfied with the disguised price increase of the telephone company, sent letters to the Taxpayers' Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to express their unanimous opinions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Letters of Appeal from Various District Branch Associations: The 41 district branch associations affiliated with the First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a joint letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession yesterday regarding the issue of telephone price increases, urging them to convene a taxpayer meeting as soon as possible. The letter stated, "Greetings, the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department has passed a new telephone system, which will be implemented from March. This public utility matter, the Public Works Department should have obtained the consent of the city's taxpayers, but unexpectedly it is being forcibly implemented. What can be tolerated? The Public Works Department's expenses are taken from the citizens' taxes, but it disregards the suffering of the citizens and almost completely deprives them of their due rights. It is really incomprehensible. Your association is a group of taxpayers in the city, and you should uphold justice on this serious issue and convene a citywide taxpayer meeting as soon as possible for a decision. The reasons for convening a taxpayer meeting are as follows: The new telephone system is related to all citizens, but the consent of taxpayers has not been sought. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department unilaterally advocated its passage. This should be discussed at a meeting. The market is sluggish, and it is difficult to maintain business. This is a fact. Rents have gradually decreased, which is in line with public opinion. How can prices be increased instead? Is this intended to force merchants to a dead end? This should be discussed at a meeting. Considering the above reasons, the telephone price increase issue passed by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department is unreasonable in terms of both reason and law. Moreover, our government is implementing interest rate reductions. The official interest rate for public utilities should not exceed five percent, which is reasonable. Your association is a group of taxpayers, and it is your responsibility to not sit idly by. You should immediately convene a meeting to make a decision and live up to the expectations of the citizens. This is the end of our statement. We hope you will investigate and reply."</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeking Opinions: The First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Greetings, the Shanghai Telephone Company, in order to satisfy its desire for an annual interest rate of 10%, has formulated new charging rules and announced that they will be implemented from March 1st. In this autumn of economic depression and industrial and commercial downturn, how can we bear the additional burden? All groups in Shanghai should work together to seek a thorough resistance to relieve the citizens of unnecessary burdens. Your association is a group of merchants in the city, and you should actively seek benefits for all members to gradually eliminate the economic panic and restore the prosperity of a few years ago. Moreover, telephone use is a tool to promote commercial communication. Once restricted by per-call charges, it will be an invisible constraint, and the intangible damage to various industries will be incalculable. Our association witnessed this with a heavy heart and could not remain silent. We have specially prepared this letter, urging you to immediately notify all members, solicit opinions, and make a strong statement. Time is pressing, so please do not ignore it."</p>
<p>Proposing Two Opinions in Japanese Yen: The Telephone Issues Committee received a letter from Hongqiao Hospital yesterday, contributing two opinions on the issue of telephone price increases. The original text stated, "The Shanghai Telephone Company in the special district of this city has disregarded the difficulties of businesses and revised telephone rates, charging by the number of calls to increase revenue. This kind of action that only seeks private gain and disregards public convenience cannot be tolerated. All citizens should rise up and oppose it. Therefore, we contribute two methods: After the telephone company implements the new rates, all telephone subscribers should remove their telephones, so that the telephone company loses its ability to exist. After the telephone company implements the new rates, continue to use the telephones as usual, and when it is time to pay the fees, all users should stop paying at the same time. Even if they cut the lines, they cannot cut them all. Any one of these two methods, if we can unite and oppose it to the end, victory will surely belong to us. We hope that you will choose one method and quickly convene all citizens who have telephones in each branch association, verbally notify them, and inform them of the advantages and disadvantages, so that we can rise up and oppose it together to achieve our goal."</p>
<h3 id="e99">Provincial Chamber of Commerce Requests the Casting of More Copper Coins <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce Sent a Telegram to President Chiang, Forwarded to Minister of Finance Kong in Nanjing: "President Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister of Finance Kong, greetings: We have seen in the news that the Central Government recently ordered the mint to cast new subsidiary coins, including three types of nickel coins and two types of copper coins. The lowest value of the copper coins is half a cent. Article 3 of the newly revised Subsidiary Coin Regulations states that subsidiary coins are calculated in decimal form, with the following number of coins equal to one legal currency yuan: five 20-cent nickel coins, ten 10-cent nickel coins, twenty 5-cent nickel coins, one hundred 1-cent nickel coins, and two hundred half-cent copper coins. Article 7 states that old general-purpose subsidiary coins will be freely recalled and destroyed by the Ministry of Finance for recasting, but within the specified period, they will still be allowed to be used at market prices. The aforementioned methods and deadlines will be determined by the Ministry of Finance by order. We believe that the use of subsidiary coins is related to the social economy. The standard of living of ordinary people in China has always been very low, which cannot be compared with that of European and American countries. Therefore, even though copper coins are in general circulation, prices are still calculated in terms of 'qianwen' (cash). In recent years, due to the rising cost of living, transactions have begun to use copper coins. Ordinary people in general are already struggling to make a living. After the use of legal tender was changed last year, the prices of various commodities have actually increased by more than 20% invisibly. If subsidiary coins are used again, and the minimum value is set at half a cent, and the old subsidiary coins are clearly designated to be destroyed by the Ministry of Finance, the increase will be no less than fifteen times for those calculated in 'qianwen,' and there will also be an increase of more than half for those trading in copper coins. Prices may rise temporarily, but it is not suitable for social life. We believe that Your Excellency is well aware of the hardships of the people and is doing everything possible to help them. Unifying the legal tender is to save the financial situation, and casting subsidiary coins is to facilitate society. Therefore, on the 3rd of this month, after discussion at the executive and supervisory meeting, it was proposed that Your Excellency be requested to cast 1-li copper coins. Even if the casting of 1-li copper coins is inconvenient due to their low value, we also hope that the government will maintain the recently determined market price of 300 copper coins per legal currency yuan, and 3 copper coins per legal currency cent, and cast 2.5-li copper coins, and still maintain the nominal value calculated in 'qianwen,' to help the poor and benefit the common people. This matter concerns the circulation of subsidiary coins and affects the social economy. We dare to send this telegram on behalf of the people, respectfully requesting your review and approval. The common people will be grateful. The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, bowing."</p>

<p>Officially Opened for Business on the 15th, Temporarily Connecting Only Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Sino-Japanese wireless telephone service, organized by the International Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, has been under active preparation by both parties for several months. The communication equipment and vacuum transmission antenna have now been completely installed at the Liu Hang International Wireless Radio Station. The chief engineer has been continuously testing communication with Tokyo, Japan in recent days, and the procedures for calling and communicating are very rapid. Although the two countries are thousands of miles apart, it is as if they are talking face to face, and the sound is very clear.</p>
<p>Midnight Communication: The bureau and the Tokyo Radio Station in Japan have decided to open communication at 12:00 PM on the 14th of this month as the final test, and the official opening of communication is scheduled for the 15th. The communication fees for calls by officials and merchants will be collected monthly by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau in the urban area. The Shanghai Telephone Company will assist in the collection in the special district. After the end of the month, the money will be transferred to the International Wireless Radio Station. The Shanghai Telephone Company in the special district will deduct a handling fee for the service.</p>
<p>Connecting Beijing and Shanghai First: Because the national long-distance telephone service has not been completely completed, it has been decided that Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tokyo, Japan will communicate first, and then gradually promote it in the future. The International Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has exchanged telephone directories of Chinese rental telephones in the Shanghai area, as well as long-distance telephone directories for Nanjing and the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, with telephone directories of Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<p>Due to Snow, the Trip was Postponed</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, in order to improve the safety and health facilities of local factories, the Qingdao Municipal Social Affairs Bureau organized the Qingdao City Industrial Safety and Health Observation Group to visit various factories in Beijing, Wuxi, Shanghai, and other places to observe various factory equipment and personnel management for reference. They left Qingdao on January 31 and visited the Industrial Safety and Health Exhibition sponsored by the Central Factory Inspection Office in Beijing, as well as various affiliated agencies of the Ministry of Industry. They then went to Wuxi on the 5th of this month to visit the factories there. They originally planned to leave Wuxi for Shanghai yesterday (the 7th), but due to the poor weather, with rain and snow, they were unable to travel, so the trip was changed to today's early train to Shanghai. After finding a place to stay, they will rest briefly and then proceed according to the planned schedule to visit the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the machine-made national goods factory. However, today happens to be a weekly holiday, so they will go tomorrow (the 10th). The members of the group include Chen Keyao, Wang Shouze, Guan Xibin, Zhou Zixi, Sun Enqing, Chen Zhihan, Xu Yao, Yao Junhe, and Li Shiku, a total of nine people, led by Wang Shouze as the group leader, to lead the observation work and consult on everything. If time permits, they will return to Qingdao on the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>A Banquet for Dr. Yung and President Li of Jiaotong University: The initial dispatch of students from our nation to study in America originated from Mr. Yung Wing's suggestion and was approved by the Qing government. Starting in the eleventh year of Tongzhi, students were sent in four batches, each consisting of thirty individuals. Mr. Yung Wing led the first batch. Recently, several veteran students from those four batches, including Mr. Yung Shangqian, Zhong Wenyao, Su Ruizhao, Ding Chongji, Kuang Bingguang, Tao Tingqing, and others, attended a banquet at the Cangzhou Hotel hosted by Mr. Li Zhaohuan, the President of Jiaotong University, and Dr. Yung. During the gathering, they reminisced about their time studying abroad, which they all found arduous and akin to banishment. Those without brothers were generally unwilling to go. This was contrasted with the current era, where people consider it an honor and eagerly seek opportunities to study abroad, a complete reversal of attitudes.

<h3 id="e103">Western Constable's Intentional Murder of Chinese: Thorough Interrogation Reveals the Truth <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Contradictory and Disjointed Testimony: Royal Counsel Reads Report, Acknowledging Falsification of Notebook Entries</p>
<p>The case of Peter, the Western chief constable of the Jiaxing Road police station, and Jutte, a probationary constable, accused of intentionally murdering Chinese man Ma Debiao, has been repeatedly tried by the British Supreme Court for China. The morning's proceedings were briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper; the trial continued in the afternoon. Chief Justice Moss announced that he felt obligated to inform the jurors that when the two defendants were initially arrested, they were only charged with inflicting physical harm on Ma Debiao. Dr. Squires was summoned as a witness, testifying that on December 6 of the previous year, he examined the body of a Chinese male at the public morgue and discovered three instances of pneumonia, the earliest of which had been contracted seven or eight days prior. The judge asked, "If you were told that the person had been thrown into the river around 3 AM on December 1, what would be your assessment of the cause of death?" The response was, "I would say that being thrown into the river would have contributed to his death." The judge said, "There is no need to focus on that. Supposing that the person you saw on December 6 had been immersed in the cold water of the Hongkou River in the early morning of December 1, and was later rescued unconscious from the river and sent to the hospital, do you believe this event would have any connection to the person's death?" The response was, "Based on the results of the post-mortem examination, I would say that this event does indeed have a connection to the person's death and could account for the most recent infection of pneumonia that was discovered." Pathologist Dr. Blacklock testified that he examined some of the deceased's lung tissue under a microscope, confirming that Dr. Squire's opinion was completely accurate. Peng Lai Te, the chief constable of the Jiaxing Road police station, testified that after receiving a report from a Chinese detective, he immediately questioned the Chinese constable who drove the two defendants out that day, the constable on duty that night, Mr. Makoviskie, and a Chinese clerk to clarify everything. He then notified his superior, Mr. Gan Leidi, by telephone. Gan summoned the driver for questioning, then summoned Jutte to the office, informing him that a serious accusation had been made against him and issuing a warning. Jutte replied that everything alleged was false and asked to submit a report later. Peter was then questioned, and he also stated that the allegations were untrue and submitted a report signed by himself. An hour later, Jutte also submitted a written report. The witness could not confirm whether the two had met and discussed things, but they could have done so. (Both reports stated that they had placed Ma Debiao in the car with the intention of taking him to the police station, but halfway there, seeing that Ma was not very ill, they stopped the car and let him out.) At this point in the testimony, the court took a fifteen-minute recess for refreshments. Peng continued to testify that around noon on December 3, he received continued reports from Peter and Jutte. He cautioned the two, stating that this could be used as evidence against them in the future, intending to dissuade them from submitting the reports. However, the two insisted on submitting them. Then, with the judge's permission, the Royal Counsel read both reports in court. Although the wording differed, the main points were the same. The changes from the initial reports were that they saw Ma Debiao was very ill at the time and wanted to take Ma to the Tongren Hospital by car. When they were proceeding along Dong Hanbi Li Road, the beggar seemed to have recovered, so they decided to leave him in the Chinese area. At that time, the car was passing the Hanbi Li Road Bridge and saw two beggar boats moored across the Hongkou River, so they turned the car into Feilun Road, stopped opposite the boats, and placed the beggar on the boat, then drove back to the police station. After the reports were read, the court adjourned. At 9:45 AM yesterday, the trial resumed, and the defendant Peter spent an hour and a half testifying and defending himself. Later, at noon, he was subjected to rigorous cross-examination. The Royal Counsel asked, "Between midnight and 2 AM on December 1, you were supposed to be on duty at the Jiaxing Road police station, but you were not at the police station. What were you doing outside?" Peter stammered in reply, stating that he was lingering with a girlfriend. Peter also admitted that the words he wrote in the office notebook were fabricated, in order to protect Chief Constable Makoviskie and himself, because Ma did not report the delay of his shift truthfully. Peter also admitted that as the duty constable, he should not have left the office, but he and Jutte personally went to check on the sick beggar, which was a violation of police regulations. This was why he signed a document that he knew was not accurate. After the Royal Counsel cross-examined him thoroughly, Peter answered one by one. The Royal Counsel pointed at Peter and asked, "You once confessed that the beggar was not seriously ill and that the hospital would not accept him." This question was intended to prove that the direction in which the defendant said the car was driving was self-contradictory. The witness testimony in this case has been completed, and a verdict should be reached soon.</p>

<p>Xu Ruixiang, Sent to Negotiate, Was Actually the Instigator: All Six Criminals Guilty, Two Acquitted</p>
<p>Xiang Yixin, a native of Ningbo, owned the Xingchang Ironworks at 151 Rue Auguste Boppe. His family was quite wealthy. Xiang was a devout Buddhist and built a family temple on Gonghe Road in Zhabei, where he often went to chant sutras morning and night. In the autumn of last year, he was once kidnapped by bandits and escaped danger. However, between October 13 and January 6 of this year, he received more than ten threatening letters from the bandit gang, initially demanding 80,000 yuan, then reducing the amount to 20,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, and finally a minimum of 5,000 yuan. Xiang sent his son-in-law, Xu Ruixiang, to negotiate with the bandits, but without success. He reported the matter to the police for arrest. Subsequently, Inspector Lu Liankui, Detective Liu Shaokui, Detectives Qian Xianting and Chen Yonggui of the General Inspectorate arrested four criminals, Gong Agen, Wei Youliang, Wang Jinzhang, and Zhang Guangen, at the Jiaotong Hotel at 37, Lane 117, Shandong Road. (It was found that this was the first batch, instigated by Xue Shandong.) It was learned that the incident was instigated by Xiang's son-in-law, Xu Ruixiang, who was an inside man. Xu lived at 52 Fanxing Lane, Xihua De Road in the Chinese area. The Sixth District Public Security Bureau sent detectives to arrest him. He confessed that his accomplice was Wang Wencheng, a native of Shandong, who lived at 31, Lane 425 of the same road, and he was also arrested. Two suspects, Liu Shanchang and Yang Fuchen, were taken into custody. Later, the First Special District Court sent a letter to transfer them, and they were sent to the Third Criminal Court along with Gong Agen and others for interrogation. Gong Agen was also found to have committed a robbery. Yang Fuchen and Liu Shanshu hired attorney Yan Gang to defend them. After deliberation and final arguments, they awaited sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the court and sentenced Gong Agen to five years and six months of imprisonment, Xu Ruixiang to three years and six months of imprisonment, Wei Youliang, Wang Jinzhang, Zhang Guangen, and Wang Wencheng to two years each. The threatening letters were confiscated. Liu Shanshu and Yang Fuchen were acquitted and released on bail by Xu Youquan, a friend.</p>

<p>Time... About 6:30 PM Last Night Location... Fangxie Road Outside Ximen Victim... "Big Sister" Police Officer</p>
<p>The proprietress of the Chen Shunbao bamboo shop, also known as "Big Sister," at No. 3 Dalin Road, West Entrance of Fangxie Back Road outside Ximen, was suddenly confronted by eight robbers around 6:30 PM last night. They spoke with local and northern Jiangsu accents. One robber wore a long black cloth robe, one had a black face and was obese, and the others wore blue and black short cloth jackets. Two robbers stood guard while six robbers broke in, produced five guns, and ordered everyone to remain silent. They monitored the shop assistants and apprentices while they robbed and looted, taking more than fifty yuan in paper money, eighty-odd small silver coins, a pair of gold earrings, a black woolen overcoat, and a handbag containing more than ten pieces of clothing. After the robbery, they also seized a Model 3 box-shaped pistol, numbered 680962, worn by Hu Muxia, officer No. 379 on post No. 21 nearby, and fled north. Hu Muxia, officer No. 379 on post No. 21, immediately reported the incident to the Tangjiawan Police Station and also reported to the Ximen Sub-Bureau for investigation. Director Yao of the sub-bureau was greatly angered upon learning of the incident and immediately ordered Li Xiaobao, captain of the detective squad, and Qian Tianxiong, deputy captain, to lead the detectives on duty, together with the bureau's officers, to pursue the robbers, but the robbers had already fled far away.</p>

<p>When the Factory Collapsed, He Claimed He Had Already Left Shanghai; No Plaintiffs Appeared in Court</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, who made a fortune by operating real estate, has suffered a significant decline in recent years due to the impact of plummeting land prices. The various businesses he operated have failed one after another. Since the closure of the Huafeng Flour Mill, where his grandfather served as general manager, the mill's workers, Jiang Kaiyang and others, sued Lu and shareholders Ye Shantao and Xu Guannan in the First Special District Court for fraud and breach of trust. At that time, Lu had left Shanghai to avoid debt, so the court temporarily suspended the portion of the case concerning Lu and summoned Ye and Xu to court for questioning. The court ruled Ye and Xu not guilty. Now that Lu has returned to Shanghai and has been arrested and detained in connection with a lawsuit against the Bank of Communications for alleged embezzlement, Judge Feng opened the court yesterday afternoon and summoned Lu to court to question him about the facts of Huafeng's closure and the fraud and breach of trust alleged by Jiang Kaiyang and others. Lu generally stated that he was unaware of the matter because he had left Shanghai when the factory collapsed. He also stated that he had heard from Ye Shantao that the workers had been dismissed with compensation. None of the workers who filed the lawsuit appeared in court. Judge Feng then announced in court that Lu Shaotang was not guilty.</p>

<p>Returned to McNeil Island to Serve Sentence</p>
<p>Leiven, the General Manager, and White, the Manager, of the American Eastern Banking Corporation, were sentenced to imprisonment by the US Court for China for alleged embezzlement and fraud. One year and five years, two years respectively. Their lawyer, Fan Keling, represented them to appeal to the court and requested bail. The request for bail was rejected by Chief Judge Hill Meek, citing legal grounds. Therefore, the two would remain in the Ward Road Prison before being escorted back to the United States. However, White has now declared his withdrawal of the appeal. Therefore, his party will be handed over to the McKinley Presidential Ship on February 18th to Seattle, then sent to McNeil Island to serve his sentence. It is expected that he will be eligible for parole when one-third of the imprisonment term has ended. As for Leiven, there has been no statement. If he continues to appeal, it remains to be determined whether he will remain imprisoned in the Ward Road Prison or be escorted to McNeil Island to await the final decision of the appellate court. A decision has not yet been made.</p>

<p>Axe Breaks Leg, Iron Rod Injures Waist; Each Claiming to Be Rogues and Not Reporting to Authorities</p>
<p>In Qiaotou, Pudong, a tailor named Xiao had been the head of a gambling ring in a teahouse near the bridge. Due to a scarcity of gamblers, he gathered many gamblers from a certain place in Yangjing to help. However, those from the Yangjing side were unable to gather enough people to gamble, and in a fit of anger, they gathered a crowd at midnight that night to disrupt the tailor's gambling den. Unwilling to be outdone, the tailor engaged in a brawl. Due to the remote location, the Yangjing police only learned of it later and dispatched officers to make arrests. Both sides fled and their whereabouts are unknown. It is said that Jia Jinbao, a member of the Yangjing gang, had his left foot severed by an axe, and Jia Wenye had his waist injured by an iron rod. Because these people claim to be rogues, they did not file charges with the authorities.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Finance previously sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the buying and selling situation at the Securities Exchange. The investigation has not yet been completed, and the Shanghai Chinese Business Securities Exchange has been ordered to postpone its opening. It has now been heard that the section chief Qu Zhaorong and the exchange supervisors Wang Xiaofan and others, dispatched by the Ministry, have already completed their investigation and submitted their report. There were no facts found to support speculation and manipulation by civil servants buying and selling short. All brokers have also pledged to cooperate with the Ministry's investigation. This case has come to an end. It is now heard that once the unified public debt and the public debt regulations are announced, the exchange will be able to open as usual, in approximately one week.</p>

<p>Tram Company Changes Exchange Rate</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, although the value of silver coins in this city has been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance to be twelve coins per legal tender yuan, the price fluctuates due to market absorption and release. Previously, due to one party hoarding a large number of silver coins, there was a sudden shortage in the market, and the price of silver coins rose sharply, with each yuan only exchanging for slightly more than eleven coins. Now, because new subsidiary coins are about to be circulated, and the credit of subsidiary coin notes is also good, fewer people in the market are collecting silver coins, so the price is falling. Yesterday, at the silver and money market, single coins were 833.3 yuan, double coins were 833.3 yuan, 1,200 coins were exchanged, and copper coins were 300,000 yuan. This morning, the exchange rate of the tram companies in the British and French concessions has also changed. The original rate of two coins for fifty copper coins, and one coin for twenty-five copper coins, has now been changed to forty-six copper coins for every two coins, and twenty-three copper coins for every one coin. As for the price of subsidiary coins, it remains at thirty copper coins for every coin.</p>

<p>Liu's Eulogy</p>
<p>Liu Haisu wrote a eulogy for Mr. Cai Zimin and his wife, Mrs. Zhou, on their double 70th birthday, saying, "The lives of the common people are mostly mediocre. If one or two individuals emerge from among them, presenting their ideas and learning, molding the people, and adapting to unprecedented changes with ease, then this singular, critical energy permeates both heaven and earth, relating to the rise and fall of the nation and its people. It is no trivial matter. Our Mr. Cai Zimin is the foremost pioneer of ideological revolution in Chinese education. During the last days of the Qing Dynasty, with internal and external troubles pressing, and the people's livelihoods in chaos, he was able to cast aside the so-called glory and reputation of the world, travel far to Europe, adopt new knowledge, and transform customs, becoming a model for later generations. After the revolution, as the first Minister of Education, he proposed the idea of aesthetic education replacing religion, instilling it in the masses. It is evident that he can expand his learning, not only perfecting himself but also working for the betterment of others. For forty years, in all kinds of weather, he has dedicated himself to transforming the customs and hearts of the world. Now, Mr. Cai is seventy years old. In the face of difficult times, he still dedicates himself to the arts and learning, hoping to save the situation and consolidate the foundation of the nation. He grasps the key points of information, and establishes high moral standards. His achievements and aspirations are truly worthy of longevity and benefit the world. Mr. Cai's virtue, reputation, and achievements are known throughout the world. His spirit is strong, just like in his prime. This is in line with Confucius's saying that the benevolent live long lives, all obtained from their nature and inherent principles, not acquired by chance. Mrs. Zhou, his virtuous spouse, is kind, respectful, frugal, knowledgeable, and learned, and is also praised by the world. Their intelligent descendants are capable of studying and saving the world, and are engaged in useful careers. After Mrs. Zhou came to be his wife, she raised several children, all of whom are intelligent. Within the family, a spirit of blessing and prosperity resides. This year, on the day and month of Mr. Cai's 70th birthday, we, his colleagues, have been inspired and guided by him, and are concerned about the decline of the nation. We dare not pick up the usual, superficial words of congratulations, and instead emphasize his virtue. We humbly express what is immortal in Mr. Cai, wishing him a strong spirit that will not weaken from seventy to old age at one hundred years old, and thus extending our national destiny to be as limitless as heaven. May Mr. Cai's thoughts and learning permeate both heaven and earth forever, and may the energy of the nation be transformed from weak to strong. This is different from the selfish prayers of the world. We respectfully write this eulogy."</p>

The event will run from 9:30 PM to 4:00 AM the following morning. Polish expatriates will also perform Polish national dances, with all dancers in authentic Polish costumes.

<p>Brain Matter Splattered, Blood Flowing Freely</p>
<p>Yesterday around 6 PM, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Chihang Bridge in the Public Concession, a uniformed police officer from the Municipal Police Bureau was riding a bicycle from west to east, speeding in front of a Route 10 bus. Upon reaching the intersection, the police officer attempted to turn south onto Chihang Road. Unexpectedly, the bicycle wheel became trapped in the tracks of a Route 3 tram, causing him to fall. A Route 10 bus, also traveling from west to east, was approaching directly behind and was unable to stop in time. The right wheel of the bus ran over the police officer's head, causing a loud crack, brain matter to splatter, and blood to flow freely. The officer on duty at the intersection witnessed the incident and recorded the bus driver's name and number. He also reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched an ambulance. However, the police officer had already died. The body was transferred to Renji Hospital and then to the coroner's office for examination. The deceased was identified as Chuan Quan, ID number 1915, a 32-year-old officer from the Hengfeng Road Police Station in Zhabei, originally from Suqian. He had taken leave from the station yesterday for personal matters and was riding his bicycle when the accident occurred. Officials from the police station arrived at the scene to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Poorhouse: Closure Temporarily Postponed Due to Spring Cold <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The city's poorhouse still houses over two thousand impoverished individuals, providing them with fifteen dan of rice daily. Recently, the poor were informed of the impending closure and dispersal, and due to the lingering cold of spring, they feared they would be unable to find work. They wept bitterly and pleaded to remain, a truly pitiful sight. Upon receiving the report, Commissioners Wang and Huang have been working tirelessly, and have gratefully received 1,000 yuan in continued spring relief from the Shanghai Charity Association, 500 yuan from the philanthropic Mr. Shi, diverting funds from his winter public feast, and the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, in addition to the 4,000 yuan already allocated for relief, has recently donated eight large boxes of cotton clothing. The Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Society has donated five shi of rice. All have requested that the poorhouse extend its relief efforts. The poorhouse estimates that it has received over 20,000 yuan in donations this year, thanks to the enthusiastic support of various sectors. The poor have been comforted and will remain housed until the weather warms up, at which point closure will be reconsidered. The poorhouse has also sent letters to various charitable organizations that pledged donations, stating, "When our poorhouse opened last winter, we received a pledge of funds from your esteemed organization, benefiting the impoverished people immensely. We are deeply grateful. We are now in urgent need of funds and hope that you will remit the pledged amount as soon as possible for our use. We eagerly await your response." Yesterday, the following organizations donated medicine for the treatment of the poor: Shanghai South Charity Association, 500 bottles of "Shasha" medicine water; Shanghai Disabled Persons' Institute, 20 dozens of Guanyin Ten-Drop water; China-West Pharmacy, 5 dozens of "Good Deed" water.</p>

<p>The Hangzhou City Fresh Produce and Vegetable Industry Association and the Gongchen Bridge Produce Merchants have reported that transporting fresh produce to Shanghai and only being able to unload at the South Shanghai and Maigen Road stations is too far from the market, causing delays and wilting. They requested permission to unload at North Shanghai Station. Considering the merchants' difficulties, the Railway Transportation Department has approved, starting from February 11th of this year, that all full carloads of fresh produce transported from various stations along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway to Shanghai may be unloaded at North Shanghai Station. However, they must be unloaded immediately upon arrival and not enter the freight depot. The arrival stations will not be responsible for storage.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Theft at the Home of Yuan Liangbing, French Municipal Council Translator, Solved Through a Gift Certificate <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Ding Jinxian Dared to Make Purchases, Leading to the Arrest of Multiple People</p>
<p>Yuan Liangbing, a translator for the French Municipal Council, residing at No. 39, Lane 93, Julida Road in the French Concession, was robbed by several armed bandits who broke into his home around 1 AM the day before yesterday. They stole clothing and cash amounting to several thousand yuan. Among the stolen items was a 50-yuan gift certificate from the Sincere Company. The number of the certificate had been recorded beforehand, and Yuan listed the stolen items and reported the theft to the French Police Station, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, detectives Liu Jinrong and Shen Jinshu were dispatched to the gift certificate shopping department of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road to wait. Around 2 PM that afternoon, a Shaoxing woman named Ding Jinxian (36 years old) used the stolen gift certificate from Yuan's home to make purchases at the Sincere Company. Ding was fashionably dressed and was immediately apprehended by the two detectives, along with the gift certificate, and taken back to the police station for questioning. Ding confessed that her accomplices were hiding at No. 18, Ma'an Lane, Dagu Road. Inspector Jiang Futian, investigator Wang Rusong, and detectives Yang Zhongfang, Gao Meiyan, and Weng Huanzhang, along with the Chengdu Road Police Station, dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the address, arresting Cao Zhibiao (20 years old, from Ningbo). Three handguns and dozens of bullets were found in the room. Cao also confessed that his accomplice, Liu Shaoshan, also known as Cao Kunshan (28 years old, from Funing), was watching a play at the Jiangbei Theater of the New Stage on Roberts Road. The detectives then went with the Sixth District Public Security Bureau to the New Stage, arresting Liu Shaoshan, also known as Cao Kunshan, his wife Liu Chen, also known as Cao Chen (21 years old), and accomplice Yun Jinlin, also known as Tang Xiaowuzi (29 years old, from the same hometown as Liu). Liu confessed that his accomplices Chen Haiqing (28 years old, from Jiangbei) and his wife Chen Cao, resided in the second-floor pavilion of No. 28, Lane 450, Yangzhou Road in eastern Shanghai. The detectives then went with the Yulin Road Police Station, dispatching a Western detective and two Chinese detectives, to secretly arrest them at the address. They first apprehended his wife Cao. Chen, hearing the police, attempted to escape by jumping out of the window, but broke his leg and fell to the ground. He was arrested and taken back to the police station, then transferred to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The arrested Yun Jinlin, also known as Tang Xiaowuzi, confessed that his accomplice Tang Xuetian was hiding on a small boat in the western section of Suzhou Creek. The detectives then went with the Sixth District Public Security Bureau to arrest Tang Xuetian. Liu Shaoshan, his wife Liu Chen, and Yun Jinlin, also known as Tang Xiaowuzi, were arrested in the Chinese Concession and are temporarily being held by the Public Security Bureau, awaiting transfer to the French Concession. Yesterday, the French Police Station sent the three suspects arrested in the French Concession, Ding Jinxian, Cao Zhibiao, and Chen Cao, to the Special Second Court, where Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the first criminal court for interrogation. Police attorney Yao Zhaodi presented the case and stated that other suspects were being held by the Public Security Bureau and requested a one-week adjournment to gather all the suspects and conduct a thorough investigation before filing charges. The investigating detectives then reported on the process of solving the case and arresting the defendants, and presented the recovered stolen items, gift certificates, and handguns and bullets to the court. When questioned, Ding Jinxian testified that her husband was involved in a lawsuit in the Chinese territory and that she had divorced him. She claimed she borrowed money from a friend yesterday to buy vegetables and was given the gift certificate, unaware that it was stolen. Cao Zhibiao's testimony was evasive. Chen Cao testified that she worked in a yarn factory and knew nothing about her husband's illegal activities. After reviewing the testimonies, the court adjourned the hearing to 9 AM on the 15th and ordered the defendants to remain in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Municipal Zoo: Pigeon Exhibition Held Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>152 Pigeons Participating, Judging to be Held at 1 PM Today, Silver Cup Awarded to the Winning Pigeon Owner with Inscription</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road held a domestic pigeon exhibition yesterday. A total of 152 pigeons participated. The exhibition will continue for one more day, with judging beginning this afternoon. The exhibition will close at 5 PM. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pigeon Breeds</p>
<p>This domestic pigeon exhibition is organized by the pigeon research association attached to the zoo. Pigeon owners registered from the 2nd to the 6th of this month. Registered pigeon owners came from more than ten locations including Shanghai, Wuxi, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, and Songjiang. Pigeon breeds included Green Shell Red Peach Blossom, Green Shell Purple Peach Blossom, Green Shell White Peach Blossom, Yellow Eye, Blood Eye, Silver White, Zijing, Dried Peach Blossom, Hybrid, and dozens of other varieties, totaling over three hundred pairs.</p>
<p>Exhibition Details</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the exhibition. The zoo displayed a white banner reading "Domestic Pigeon Exhibition" at the entrance. From the entrance, small square tables were arranged in a circle, and pigeon cages were placed on them, each with a number. The cages were displayed in order. However, due to the heavy snow, pigeon owners from other locations were unable to send all their pigeons to the zoo on time, so the actual number was only 152 pairs.</p>
<p>Judging Today</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, among the pigeons participating in yesterday's exhibition, the Silver White, Zijing, and Dried Peach Blossom varieties were the rarest and most valuable. There was also a pair called Songjiang Gray, whose pupils were invisible to the naked eye and required lighting to be seen. This can be called a unique breed. The zoo has scheduled judging for 1 PM this afternoon. The judging criteria will be based on the pupil, feather color, and body, with points awarded to determine the winner.</p>
<p>Awarding Pigeon Owners</p>
<p>The winning pigeon owner will be presented with an inscription by a famous person, including Mayor Wu's "Soaring a Thousand Miles in One Flight," Bureau Chief Pan's "Faster Than Postal Delivery," Tong Hangbai's "Surpassing the Ordinary," Cai Jinjun's "Faster Than Mail Delivery," and over twenty others. There will also be silver cups from the Pigeon Research Association and the Municipal Zoo, as well as multiple silver shields. The judges will be pigeon experts Zhou Zhiyong, Zhang Si, Feng Yikui, He Bokang, Jiang Zuruo, and Jin Doushan. The exhibition will end tonight.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Smokers Entering the City from Other Provinces and Cities Must Obtain a License from the Public Security Bureau <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Severe Punishment for Those Found without a License, Regardless of the Duration of Stay</p>
<p>Public Notice from the Municipal Public Security Bureau: It has been found that this city is a national commercial center with many merchants and travelers coming and going. Among them, there are many who are addicted to opium smoking. Since the Bureau began registering smokers, very few registered smokers from other provinces and cities who move to or travel to this city have exchanged their licenses or travel permits with the Bureau. The reason for this is either ignorance of the anti-smoking laws and the procedures for exchanging licenses, or intentional evasion due to the short duration of the trip, hoping to conceal the addiction. These loopholes have a serious impact on the anti-smoking policy. Those who hold ordinary limited-term smoking cessation licenses must, if moving to this city, follow the provisions of Article 8 of the Regulations on the Strict Implementation of Smoking Cessation and the Prohibition of Addicts, bring their original license to the Bureau for cancellation, and apply for a limited-term license for this city. The Bureau will then send the cancelled license to the original county or city for cancellation. If they are traveling temporarily and staying for less than three months, they can exchange their original license for a travel permit from the Bureau. Those who hold poor people's limited-term smoking cessation licenses must follow the provisions of item D of Article 5 of the Measures for the Limited-Term Registration of Addicts, bring their poor people's smoking cessation license from their original county or city to the Bureau to apply for a seal to continue using it. The regulations for exchanging licenses and permits are extremely detailed, and the Bureau, in charge of important anti-smoking policies, cannot be lenient. In the future, all registered smokers from other provinces and cities who move to or travel to this city, regardless of the duration of their stay, must comply with the above procedures and exchange their licenses and permits with the Bureau. Those who evade or conceal their addiction and fail to comply will be severely punished according to the law. In addition to issuing orders to subordinate units to conduct strict inspections at any time, this notice is hereby issued for public knowledge and compliance. This notice.</p>
<h3 id="e123">President Luo of the Court Instructs the Bar Association to Clarify the Issue of Trial Time <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Mutual Understanding of Factual Difficulties, the Establishment of a Question Office is Highly Usable</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association held an executive supervisory meeting the night before last. Zhang Yongqing, a member of the association, reported to the Shanghai District Court that the court was not punctual in hearing criminal cases and did not notify lawyers to appear in court to defend simple criminal cases, requesting that the association forward a letter to correct these issues. The matter was published in the newspapers. Luo, the president of the Shanghai District Court, read the report and believed that there was some misunderstanding regarding the points raised by the lawyer. Yesterday, he instructed the Shanghai Bar Association, "To the matter of the notification, I have recently read in the newspapers that the association convened the 217th joint meeting, listing several items requesting the court to correct. The court will gladly accept any matter that is beneficial to the convenience of the parties. However, the court handles many civil and criminal cases every day. The points raised by member Zhang Yongqing, as passed by the association, may be occasionally true, but there are factual difficulties. It would be regrettable to generalize from one or two examples. The member did not specify the date, court, or case, so the court cannot investigate. Because the matter is important, I hereby instruct the association to explain each point raised by the member and include the following corrective measures: Regarding the time of civil and criminal court hearings, each presiding judge should arrive in court on time. However, due to the order of cases, if Case A is scheduled for 9 AM and Case B is scheduled for 10 AM, and sometimes Case A is more complicated or the lawyers representing both sides debate for a longer time, and one hour is not enough to complete the inquiry, then the opening time of Case B will inevitably be slightly delayed. As for the execution of cases, each judge of this court summons more than thirty cases every day. At the time of each hearing, the cases are tried in court according to the rules. These are all real situations. In the future, if lawyers have doubts about the opening of the court, they can directly submit them to the president of the court. If they have doubts about the execution of cases, they can directly inquire in writing, and the reasons will be answered. Regarding the delivery of verdicts, there have been some delays during holidays, which have been strictly rectified. In the future, they will be delivered on time. In simple criminal cases, the appointed defenders often submit their letters of appointment the day before or on the day of the hearing, so the court does not have time to notify them in writing, but still notifies them to appear in court in a simple way. There has been no case of failing to notify lawyers. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the progress of cases and streamline procedures, a question office has been established with question books and question forms. Lawyers can list facts and make statements to the question office at any time for verification. It is hereby ordered that the association be notified. This order."</p>

<p>Registration Before April 5th</p>
<p>Liu Ruiheng, the Director of the Department of Health, considering that the qualifications of practicing dentists in various localities are inconsistent, urgently needs to promulgate regulations for management. He has drafted the Provisional Rules for the Management of Dentists and the Measures for the Examination of Dentists, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgated and implemented on October 1, 1935. All practicing dentists in various localities who do not meet the qualifications of dentists stipulated in the current rules must first undergo an examination. Those who pass the examination and obtain a certificate can also apply for a dentist's certificate. The first dentist examination has been scheduled for April 20th. Those who are registered with local government agencies to practice dentistry, or who have studied at a registered person's business for more than three years, must submit their credentials, photographs, resumes, and fees to the Department before April 5th for review, in order to participate in the upcoming dentist examination.</p>

<p>From 1,000 to 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo Industrial Bank Preparatory Office for Restoration of Business was ordered to release savings deposits, it has paid out more than 80% of the total amount of claims to date. The procedures for the third batch of withdrawals have also been completed. It is now planning to release the fourth batch of savings to depositors with balances between 1,000 and 5,000 yuan. It is currently verifying account books and addresses and will send letters to notify depositors to claim their funds. As for commercial deposits and special transactions, they began to be released on the 1st of this month. Many depositors have been going to withdraw their funds in recent days, but there are still a small number of savings depositors with balances under 1,000 yuan, either due to unknown addresses or relocation, making it impossible to communicate. The office is urgently needing to complete preparations and resume business as soon as possible. It has been decided that savings depositors with balances under 1,000 yuan, as well as commercial and special transaction account holders, do not need to wait for a notification letter from the office and can bring their deposit certificates directly to withdraw their funds.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Shanghai Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factory Association held its Second Session of the Ninth General Assembly at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road at 7 PM the night before last. More than 200 people, including all member representatives and guests, attended.

Domestic goods transportation certificates; 8. Co-sponsored supplementary school; 9. Publications; 10. Staff.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>After the report on association affairs, the proposals were discussed. Cai Shengbai, a member of the General Affairs Committee, proposed that insurance documents used by Chinese insurance companies should use Chinese characters. If foreign languages are also used, it should be stated that Chinese is the standard. The proposal was submitted to the Ministry of Industry to be forwarded to the Executive Yuan and consulted by the Legislative Yuan when deliberating the Insurance Law, paying special attention to this matter. Before the promulgation of the Insurance Law, the ministries should instruct the insurance industry to correct all documents and not use foreign languages as the standard, in order to uphold national dignity. It was resolved and passed. Tian Xuwo proposed to organize a domestic goods promotion group. It was resolved and handed over to the Executive Committee for handling. It was proposed to prepare for the re-election. Two vote counters and four vote readers were first appointed. The candidates will be nominated by the Executive Committee. After the proposals were discussed, Chen Diexian, Shen Jiucheng, Pan Yangyao, Pan Xulun, and other guests gave speeches (details omitted). A dinner was then held, and everyone enjoyed themselves until around 10 PM before dispersing.</p>

Captain Wu (represented by Li) reported, stating briefly, "We have invited everyone here today to discuss the implementation of collecting national aviation salvation funds from the boiled water industry in this city. The general captain was unable to attend due to other matters and is represented by me. Your industry's patriotic enthusiasm in suggesting support for the aviation salvation fundraising campaign and collecting national aviation salvation funds is greatly appreciated. In the first fundraising campaign in March 1933, we received enthusiastic support from all sectors of the city, raising over 1.3 million in just a few months and enrolling 100,000 members to purchase airplanes, assist the government, and strengthen national defense. In March of last year, this city continued to hold the second fundraising drive. Various industries, including your industry, the hotel industry, the butchering industry, the vending industry, and the fresh meat industry, which began collecting national aviation salvation funds during the first fundraising campaign, are still in the process. Recently, the freight trucking industry, the sand and gravel industry, the yellow sand and crushed stone industry, the brick and ash industry, the dance hall industry, the civilian ship industry, the coal and stone barge industry, and the restaurants have successively suggested collecting national aviation salvation funds based on the standard of business revenue, and the progress has been excellent. Your industry should unite, concentrate its efforts to promote aviation salvation, and do its best to raise national aviation salvation funds. If anyone has any opinions, we hope you will express them freely." Subsequently, Li Sheng, Chen Dianshi, and Che Lisheng from the industry's guild spoke one after another, stating briefly, "The collection of national aviation salvation funds is a matter of supporting the aviation salvation movement. We are citizens and should do our best to fulfill our duties."

A photograph was then taken, and the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Military Cap Industry Labor-Contracting Dispute <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Will Mediate According to Law</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The military cap labor-contracting parties in this city, in July of last year, signed a labor-contracting agreement for the 25th year at the Social Affairs Bureau. The contractor Zhong Changyuan and others contracted to produce 220,000 spring military caps this year. In order to fulfill the contract, the contractor submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, ordering the Shanghai Military Uniform Workers' Union to instruct its military cap industry members to go to work. After receiving the request, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately ordered the union to instruct its members to go to work. The union, upon receiving the order, selected six tailoring workers and forty-eight sewing workers, each carrying a sewing machine, and brought them with instructions to the military cap factory at Kangti Lane, Kangti Fang in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, when the workers arrived at the factory gate, the contractor not only did not allocate work, but also closed the factory gate tightly, not allowing the workers to enter the factory. Seeing that the contractor Zhong Changyuan and others were openly violating government orders, the workers elected representatives to petition party and government agencies, and the Municipal Party Department sent Fan Guoren and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhao Lian to mediate, but without result. Furthermore, a large number of detectives were sent by the French Concession police to disperse the workers and detain all the sewing machines. Representatives of party and government agencies believe that the contractor Zhong Changyuan and others first requested the government to order the union to send workers to work, and then defied the order and refused to employ them, which is greatly dissatisfied. It is planned to schedule a mediation. The military uniform union, considering the contractor's inconsistent behavior, reliance on the concession, and violation of the contract, causing great losses to the workers, has decided to collect evidence, hire Zhou Lianze as a lawyer, and legally pursue various losses.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, After reading the Da Mei Evening News of January 19th regarding the news of the Ministry of Industry's relief for sericulture, it stated, "Last year, the price of silk abroad soared, so silk factories had considerable surpluses. Factory shutdowns were frequent, but some silk factories intentionally shut down because they currently have more than eight million dan of silk in storage, which can be maintained until the new silkworms come on the market." This news is absolutely untrue. Whether silk factories had considerable surpluses or intentionally shut down is not true. At that time, the investigation of silk stored in Shanghai was only over two thousand dan, which is not comparable to the so-called eight million dan. Also, the Xinwen Daily News reported on January 27th that eight silk factories opened that day, and on January 28th, the newspaper reported that nine silk factories opened. According to the facts, they are not in accordance with reality. At that time, not a single silk factory in Shanghai opened. Last year, although the market was slightly better for silk factories in Shanghai, they did not necessarily have considerable surpluses, and they were mostly forced to shut down due to the impact of restrictions on silk sales in Zhejiang Province and the exhaustion of raw materials. This special letter is sent to you, hoping that you will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Guild Committee, February 7th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, My residence in Shanghai was robbed yesterday morning, with losses of only a hundred yuan in cash, over two hundred small coins, two watches, four rings, and a personally owned pistol, totaling no more than three to five hundred yuan, which is far from what was reported. It is because I am an ordinary businessman, serving as the factory director of Yifeng General Factory, not the manager, and my simple residence is far from extravagant. Although I was robbed, it was only a small amount. I respectfully request that my letter be published to clarify the truth. With public friendship, sincerely, Wu Huangxiang, February 8th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, According to Zhou Weisheng's statement, he was shocked to read the news item "Farmers Accuse Baoshang" in the news column of the Shen Bao on the 7th of this month. The case of my client being falsely accused of enticing lewdness by Zhou Miaogen to the Shanghai District Court has been answered by me according to law, and a counter-accusation of false accusation has been filed. Once the investigation is concluded, the truth will be clear. The sections published in the newspaper are completely inconsistent with the facts.

<h3 id="e151">Today's Scotto Cup Semifinal: Tung Wah vs. Western Merchants <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Group A match will be held at the Shen Garden Youyou Swimming Pool starting at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Western Union Football League this season, it has been frequently interrupted by rain. Yesterday, three Zilin Cup matches and six league matches were postponed due to the heavy snow the night before and the wet field. Among today's originally scheduled events, the most important is the Scotto Cup semifinal between Tung Wah and Western Merchants for the right to compete for the championship, as well as the Zilin Cup third-week semifinal between Health and Lux. In addition, there will be nine matches in Group A, Group C, and Group E of the league. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah vs. Western Merchants</p>
<p>The most important match today is the Scotto Cup semifinal between Tung Wah and Western Merchants, held at Shen Garden. Western Merchants is mediocre and incompetent. Judging from their performance in the league this season, with only two wins and one draw in six matches, their strength can be imagined. Tung Wah is likely to win today. The Portuguese team is awaiting the final. However, for Tung Wah's prospects in the Scotto Cup, even if they beat Western Merchants today, they still need to win one more match to retain the championship. Tung Wah will field Lu Zhong'en as goalkeeper today, who has recently regained his eligibility. This is Zhong'en's first match since regaining eligibility. The full team lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Youyou vs. Western Police</p>
<p>Youyou's record in Group A this season is three wins and zero losses. They will play Western Police in the Group A match at Jiaozhou Park today. Western Police has lost four times in six matches this season, so it will be difficult to prevent Youyou from winning. However, whether Youyou will play today is uncertain, according to the person in charge of the association. It will depend on the field conditions. The lineup has been decided as follows:</p>

<p>Eagles Defeat Seven Teams, Group A and B: 39 to 32</p>
<p>Mai Ling Defeats Xie Xing, Group A: 68 to 21</p>
<p>Two matches were played by the Shanghai Basketball Association last night. The Eagles defeated Seven Teams, 39 to 32. Mai Ling defeated Xie Xing by a large margin, 68 to 21. There will be three matches tonight. The results of the two matches last night are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Eagles Overpowers Seven Teams: The match between the Eagles and Seven Teams was a Group A and B match for the Shanghai Association. The strength of both sides was comparable. Initially, they both scored points, and it was difficult to tell the difference. However, the Eagles led by one or two points all the way. Seven Teams worked hard to keep up. The closest scores were 21 to 20 and 29 to 30. Because Seven Teams was too eager to win, they made mistakes and missed opportunities, which was regrettable. As a result, the Eagles won 39 to 32.</p>
<p>Eagles: Fouls: Points; Seven Teams: Fouls: Points</p>
<p>Qian Dingshen: 1: 4; Zuo Shi: 1: 9</p>
<p>Mai Ling vs. Xie Xing: Mai Ling and Xie Xing played in a Group A match. Recalling the Western Youth Association tournament, the two teams met once, and Xie Xing defeated them by one point. Last night, the two teams met again on a narrow road. Mai Ling was determined to take revenge, and launched a fierce attack from the start, catching Xie Xing off guard. Qiangsheng, Bolisi, and Mofei charged back and forth, dominating the game. The score soared. At the end of the first half, Mai Ling had 34 points, and Xie Xing had 10 points. In the second half, the Xie Xing players were still disheartened. Their offense was ineffective, and their defense was full of loopholes. The situation was still difficult to improve. In the last five minutes, Xu Heng and Zhou Dayun made some contributions, but the initial losses were too great, and it was impossible to recover. They were defeated 21 to 68. The results of the two teams are listed on the left:</p>

<p>In the process of the Northern Expedition, the mass revolution movement led by youth established the foundation for the completion of the Northern Expedition. This was because the youth at that time had a unified and correct goal, knowing that they were seeking the eradication of warlords and the establishment of a unified revolutionary government. Now, times have changed, and the situation is completely different. Youth should first seek a correct understanding and then have correct actions. In summary, the mutual slaughter of imperialists and the anti-aggression wars of oppressed nations will inevitably be unavoidable. Our only preparation is the awakening of the whole people and the soundness of the youth themselves, so that they can win in the future anti-aggression war. The central government has established the road ahead for revolutionary construction. This is a great process for completing the Chinese revolution and a necessary preparation for our anti-aggression war. The power of the revolution is established through the construction of a road. They can gain liberation from future wars. Youth is the foundation of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese revolution is the foundation of China's liberation. China's liberation is the foundation for the liberation of oppressed nations along the Pacific coast. The liberation of oppressed nations along the Pacific coast is the foundation for the liberation of oppressed humanity around the world. Chinese youth, how great is the responsibility here? The soundness of Chinese youth is the foundation of the above-mentioned foundations. The soundness of Chinese youth lies in educational development. Obviously, past Chinese education cannot bear this mission. In extraordinary times, there is education for extraordinary times. In the past, the youth's recognition was not clear about the goals of the Chinese revolution, and they could not determine united revolutionary action. On the contrary, they were easily agitated by passion and incited by villains, dispersing the front of the national revolution. This is the failure of Chinese education. The Chinese youth education in the extraordinary period must make the youth know about the inevitable mutual slaughter of imperialists and the anti-aggression war of oppressed people in the international community, know that revolutionary construction is the foundation for China to win the future anti-aggression war in the country, and know that their own soundness is the condition for completing China's revolutionary construction in themselves. We must review the present, grasp the real problems, implement construction, create the power of struggle, sharpen the ten Qi to develop the great festival of dying for the country, and then can lead the whole people to advance on the revolutionary road under the correct goals.</p>
<p>This is certainly the responsibility of Chinese educators, but it is also the effort that we youth ourselves should have. We must start from our own efforts, start from united organizations, establish Chinese youth education in extraordinary times, and cultivate Chinese youth in extraordinary times. Youths of the Chinese era, the twentieth century is the era of China's liberation. China's liberation is based on the completion of the construction of Chinese youth education. The giant wheel of the times will force us to move forward. The liberation of all oppressed humanity is our responsibility. Youths of the Chinese era, take on this glorious responsibility.

<p>Since our country's scouting cause has been vigorously promoted by the government, its achievements have been advancing by leaps and bounds. In the past, schools above the junior high school level across the country were ordered to add scouting courses uniformly. Because there are many schools in the country, the demand for instructors and teachers is high. Liangjiang Girls' Physical Education School in Jiangwan, Shanghai, first created a girl scout instructor training class to engage in cultivation. It has been several years. Since girl scout education is most practical today, we must strive to promote it. Therefore, we have formulated an expansion plan for this season, adding specialized personnel, increasing equipment courses, and focusing on labor and housework to instill the various knowledge and skills that women need most. Since the enrollment began, many letters from various places have inquired about the information and registered.</p>

<p>— Among the children, except for Fulan and Shoumi, no one knew what had happened. When they ran downstairs the next morning, they were truly shocked and felt extremely uneasy. The mansion seemed lonely and deserted without its master and mistress. Breakfast was no longer the happy occasion with Mrs. Shu officiating at the tea ceremony. Instead, it was a dull and tasteless meal. When class time arrived, Mr. Pei's seat was also empty. They wandered around for about an hour, feeling lost and unable to console themselves, waiting for news and hoping that Little Qiao's father was not in danger, because the good man John Bullock was deeply loved by the children. Ten o'clock had already arrived, but no one came to alleviate their doubts. They didn't want to play, but time seemed to pass too slowly. They were restless, feeling bored and worried. Suddenly, Fulan stood up and said in his usual moving words: "Hey, I have an idea, children! Let's go to the classroom and do our homework as if Uncle is still here. That way, time will pass faster, and I know it will also make him happy." "But who will listen to us read?" Jake asked. "I will, although what I know is not much more than what you know, but I am the oldest here. If you don't mind, I will try to be his substitute until he comes back."</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance. Banks Collect Spot Goods. Bidding Prices Surge. The Air of Good News Suddenly Thickens. Swaps May Be Eliminated. Closing Up Four Yuan. Yesterday, the gold market saw rising silver prices, falling customs gold, sluggish trading at the start, a certain bank patching up swaps, collection of spot goods, panic elimination about swaps, growing buying interest, rumors of good news resurfacing, and a fairly firm outcome. Initially, it was said that overseas silver market saw London rising half a cent against New York, and that after the market opened, it was above the listed price of 0.0625, that India was buying both spot and forward, and that sellers appeared to be tightening, further fueling the rise. The forward silver price in Monte Carlo all rose by 5.5 cents, and exchange rates also increased. The price of London raw gold fell by 3.5 pence. The Central Bank announced its listed rates, with no change for both the British pound and US dollar, and the customs gold unit fell by 8 cents. The standard bidding price was listed at 1143.5 yuan. When the over-the-counter preliminary trading opened, it immediately fell to 1142.7 yuan, and then Dadexing and Fuyu took the opportunity to buy in at low prices, rising to 3.5 yuan. Qianyuan Yongsheng sold. The opening price was the same as the previous day's closing price. After the opening, major players maintained the price at low levels, then pulled it up. Some banks offered to sell, but there was still fluctuation. A certain bank then patched up swaps and collected spot goods, improving sentiment gradually, and the price continued to rise. HSBC announced its listed rates, with no change for both the British pound and US dollar. At this time, the market fluctuated uncertainly. When major players such as Daheng started buying, the silver equalization tax was announced to have increased by 0.75. Buying interest gradually increased, but because there was not much trading within the market, the market was quite sluggish. However, large Chinese merchants were actively pursuing US dollars, and various rumors of good news resurfaced, further fueling buying interest. Short sellers also covered their positions, creating a special situation where the opening price was the lowest and the closing price was the highest. The market remained stable after closing. Since the implementation of legal tender, although the gold market has experienced several price increases, it has always been suppressed by sellers before the swaps, and many parties were reluctant to post swaps. Currently, the interbank lending rate has decreased, and various asset holders are successively collecting spot goods. The swap premium fell to around 3.5 yuan yesterday.

Securities: Bonds Amid Market Suspension. More than a week has passed since the Chinese Securities Exchange suspended trading, and there is still no definite news about when trading will resume. It is rumored that trading may resume next Monday, and that the original goods will still be traded, but only for settlement, and new trading will remain temporarily suspended. The veracity of this statement remains to be confirmed. Because the market has been suspended for a long time, there have been some fluctuations in the black market, mostly involving spot transactions. It is speculated that these transactions are due to the outflow of spot goods. Transactions are very few. However, Lianhe Securities Company, an affiliate of Broker No. 12, has the most spot transactions, as it is backed by a certain money house and usually engages in spot transactions. Here is a list of the black market prices, classified according to the unified public bond regulations. However, prices fluctuate from time to time; this is only a general overview and is for reference only. Unified Class A Public Bond, issued for 150 million yuan, with a term of 12 years. Low-Priced Stock Trading Active in New York. Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported (on the 7th) that the New York stock market saw mixed performance. Low-priced stocks were actively traded with strong gains.

Auburn Automobile, Acme Steel, Coca-Cola, Mack Truck, and Midland Steel, and Western Union Telegraph rose sharply by 2 to 5 yuan, as their prospects were optimistic. However, as Dow Jones published comments indicating lower oil prices, experts here disagreed, but speculators sold oil stocks out of caution, causing slight weakness in oil stocks. Chrysler opened at its highest point since 1929, but then fell back slightly as bulls took profits. Other auto stocks saw mixed performance. Packer was the most actively traded on the stock exchange. Telephone stocks were slightly weak as bulls took profits. Railroad and utility stocks were quite calm. Small exchanges saw mixed stock performance, and the bond market was firm.

The yarn market saw a morning decline and an afternoon rise, with the situation slightly improved. After several days of continuous decline, the market showed signs of a rebound. Initially, it was due to yarn inventory in yarn warehouses reaching over 24,000 bales, with sluggish movement of yarn, and sluggish sales of spot yarn. In the afternoon, market rumors abounded, due to the rebound in bidding prices and a certain bank issuing more banknotes, benefiting the bulls. Market prices rose by over 1 yuan. Changfeng alone dumped a huge amount of 9,750 bales. Bidding Yarn Sees Both Filling and Turning Short. The bidding yarn market opened in the morning with a dull and weak market, and Osaka Sampin yarn also fell back. Sentiment was scattered, but Da Ji's Xu bought in large quantities, tightening the near months slightly. Bidding prices for the distant months tended to loosen. As Changfeng suddenly turned from long to short, the market still tended to decline after the second session. As a result, each month fell by 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 cents to 1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market opened in the afternoon with very strong rumors favoring the bulls. Each month jumped higher uniformly. Retail investors bought to cover their positions, and market prices advanced step by step. However, Changfeng continued to sell off aggressively. As a result, each month rose by 0.8, 0.9 cents to 1.125 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,100 bales, Changfeng sold 9,750 bales, Da Ji sold 550 bales, and Taichang sold 600 bales.

The purchase volume for each price is listed below: Cotton Market Initially Falls and Then Rises. Initially, the situation for foreign cotton was generally weak, and Osaka Sampin cotton also continued to fall. Furthermore, the yarn market was powerless, resulting in a downturn. In the afternoon, it was heard that the bidding price had rebounded, and that the political news from American cotton was favorable to the bulls. Therefore, many parties were active, and the market rebounded. However, Changhe sold off a huge amount of 11,800 piculs. Bidding Flowers Sees Large Dump by Changhe. The bidding flower market opened in the morning with each month still generally weak and sluggish. Although American cotton rose 1 to 5 pounds, and Indian cotton rose 1 to 1.5 rupees, Osaka Sampin cotton still fell 0.3 and 0.4 cents, and many bulls had not yet cleared their positions, so the situation was still softening. As a result, each month fell by 0.2 and 0.3 cents compared to the previous day's closing, and the distant months fell 0.5 to 1 cent. The market suddenly tightened in the afternoon. News regarding American cotton suggested a rebound, and buying interest was strong. The bidding price was closing at a high point, and a certain bank was issuing new banknotes. Therefore, speculation was rife, and short sellers covered their positions. As a result, each month jumped up 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tong Ji sold 2,200 piculs, Zhenda sold 1,000 piculs, Changyu sold 1,300 piculs, Renfeng sold 1,200 piculs, Dafu sold 1,900 piculs, Yuanda sold 1,500 piculs, Taichang sold 1,600 piculs, and Changfeng sold 2,300 piculs.

Osaka Sampin yarn flowers fall back. Yesterday, American cotton opened with each month falling 1 to 4 pounds. Traders waited for developments in Washington. However, due to heavy snow and storms in the area, the number of attendees was insufficient, causing delays in the decision. Liverpool and Bombay dealers sold, but were countered by favorable Liverpool telegrams. Later, traders bought in at limited prices and covered their positions, and market prices improved. New buying and selling were lacking. Hester's estimated factory use for the week at 326,000 bales. Liverpool inventory was 409,000 bales. Closing was flat, with spot up 5 pounds and futures up 2 to 5 pounds. British cotton futures rose 3 points, and spot rose 8 points.

Burmese cotton, African cotton, and South American cotton were not imported. Sugar Market: Xinghua Tribute Sees Daily Price Increase of Yuan. Yesterday, the sugar market saw very little trading due to it being Saturday. The trend did not change much. The association's listed price for Grade 24 raw white sugar was 22.7 yuan for spot and 7.6 yuan for re-export. East Red (MS) brand was 15.8 yuan, NKC brand was 16.7 yuan. Grade 8 East White spot was 22.6 yuan and re-export was 7.2 yuan. Grade 9 YRO brand was 21.85 yuan and re-export was 6.85 yuan. There were few transactions for all of these. The local factory's refined white sugar, Zhenji No. 1, was 21.5 yuan. The remaining prices remained the same. Domestic Chaoqing from the Shanghai market was stable, but it was heard that the Shantou price was 12.4 to 12.5 yuan. Xinghua Dagong powdered white sugar saw increased demand, and traders were commissioning Xinghua merchants to purchase directly. As a result, production prices shifted to medium, and it was reported yesterday that prices had risen by Yuan. (The price of 3,250 Dutch guilders for the Dutch Grade 23 raw white sugar dumped by Dachang was mistaken for 3,225. The company apologizes for the correction.) Oil Market: Soybean Oil Plummets, Plummeting Two Yuan Six Seven Cents. Continuous Soybean Trading Suddenly Halts. Since the opening bell for soybean oil, the market has steadily declined, mainly because there was a shortage of goods at the opening, and prices were too high, leading to various sales markets taking a wait-and-see approach. However, amidst the stagnation, Dalian soybean prices frequently fell, and there were no transactions for local car soybeans. Other prices were also affected, with only 1,000 bags of Kailudou and Zhadou traded and one car of Sipingjie. The local oil price was greatly affected and experienced yesterday's plunge. Compared to the opening price, the Dalian oil price fell by 2.6 yuan, the Niuzhuang oil price fell by 2.4 yuan, the Dalian Qishan oil price fell by 2.7 yuan, and the local factory oil price fell by 2.6 yuan. Current sentiment is even more sluggish, but the actual supply is not flooding in, and factory inventory is not sufficient, with only about nearly 1,000 items. Therefore, if the sales market can recover, there is still hope for a recovery. Grain: Su Tong Thin Rice Relies on Northern Sales. Transactions for Guest Xiang Are Quite Sluggish. (Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total supply from various sources reached over 30 companies (totaling about 7,000 stones). The market situation was generally sluggish. Local sales continued to be weak. Ruo Nangang's early rice fell by a small amount of 0.1 yuan. Fortunately, Su Tong粳had 1,000 bags bought at low prices, rising slightly by 0.05 yuan. As for thin rice, it also relied on Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other companies continuing to purchase over 3,000 bags, which helped to stabilize prices. Dujian saw no rise or fall. Yinbian Yuan goods were scarce and fragrant. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were 26 or 27 companies supplying goods from Hexia. Guest goods were selling in the market. White 粳store sales were sluggish, and prices were falling slightly. Thin rice from Tianjin was not selling, and retail sales were also sluggish, with prices falling slightly. Yangpu Jian was difficult to sell, and the market was also sluggish, falling slightly. Passenger Jian was weak by a few cents. Sales of white Yuan were flat, and the market was also showing signs of weakening. The prices of other goods were also weakening. (Guest Xiang) To-the-head supplies from various ports along the Yangtze River and various regions of eastern Zhejiang arrived in Shanghai, but sales were only slightly responsive on the local street. Northern companies have frozen purchases in succession, while southern provinces have other support. They are also taking a wait-and-see approach. Local warehousemen have been holding inventory for a long time, and actual sales are limited. The market is gradually softening. Yesterday, all stalls saw a small decline of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. 1,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 348 bags of Shashi coarse rice, and 85 bags of Wenzhou Liu rice were offered, all of which were purchased by the local street, it was said. Distant Wheat Sees Weakness, Spot Goods Remain Firm. Yesterday's distant wheat market saw few transactions in the near term during the morning opening. Prices remained unchanged. However, in June and July, the market trended towards flatness and weakness due to slight hedging by customers. At the afternoon opening, it was heard that spot ocean wheat prices were slightly cheaper, opening at 6.85 yuan or 6.9 yuan. Furthermore, due to the price of futures ocean wheat falling by a small amount in Chicago at 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, and in Canada at 0.02 to 0.03 yuan to 0.06 yuan, sentiment weakened. The opening price immediately softened. The near and distant terms all fell by around 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan. However, the market for this month's spot goods remained firm, and traders slightly bought to cover their positions, presenting a stable market. The spot wheat market saw smooth transactions, with factories purchasing over 2,000 bags in total. High-grade goods were still trading at 5.3 yuan and secondary-grade goods at 5.25 yuan, similar to the previous day. The flour exchange remained closed for the Lantern Festival. Sesame Falls to 15 Yuan Level. The situation will be even worse if Yihuo does not purchase. Yesterday morning, the opening trading volume for ocean sesame was quite smooth, but as large ocean merchants hoarded it, and those with spot goods frequently hedged, market sentiment weakened again. The opening prices for February, March, and April fell by about 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading turned quiet at the afternoon opening, and the market stabilized. As Yihuo Foreign Firm purchased 500 tons of spot goods at 10.07 yuan (including tax), market sentiment stabilized slightly. The market fell only by a small amount of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. As a result, the market fell by 0.28 yuan this month and by 0.24 yuan in March. North-South Goods: Quanzhou Dried Longan Prices Are High and Expensive. Recently, the price of mixed dried longan has increased in Shanghai, and production prices have risen accordingly. However, according to yesterday's report, high-grade Quanzhou goods had reached 65 yuan in Shanghai, exceeding the Shanghai market by 3 to 4 yuan. Therefore, the market is showing tightness again. If subsequent shipments are not abundant, the opening price will likely increase. However, this still depends on whether sales are smooth. Piece Goods: Serge and Flannel All Rise in Price. Serge prices have risen across the board because old inventory was very thin, and new arrivals this year have sharply increased in cost. For gray plain serge, and medium-grade materials, the sellers are also aware of the situation. In addition, as the spring selling season has arrived, they have had to increase prices. Therefore, the trend for serge is quite tight. The prices of flannel sets and suits have risen the most, because the piece goods industry is mostly involved in real business, does not prepare extra fabric, and only trades in samples with cash. They will not sell unless they recover their full cost. Even the old goods in stock must be priced up to equal the new goods. Because the colors are different, and once the tailor's sample is determined, it must be cut. Most of the regular medium-grade materials are mainly Japanese goods, and selling prices have also increased and are selling well, due to the Japanese exchange rate and customs duties. Sales are better for medium-grade than for flannel suits. This is because piece goods stores do not have a sufficient inventory and urgently need to sell, unlike suit shops, which still have goods in stock for comparison. Miscellaneous News: Beihai Fennel Continues to Rise, Already Up Six Yuan From Before. There is still a rising trend. The price of Beihai fennel was weak last winter, reaching 24 to 25 yuan. Recently, the market has shifted and prices have risen step by step. The opening price at the first market was 28.8 yuan. The drugstore industry bought in at the highest price. It then rose to 30 yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that the market price had reopened at 31 yuan, a total increase of 6 yuan. However, the goods available are already scarce, and it is heard that production prices in Shanghai need to be 35 to 36 yuan. Therefore, the asking price has increased again. The market is sure to continue to rise. Silk and Tea: Hopes for Chinese Tea Trade with Russia Dashed. The Chinese tea trade with Russia, which was prosperous in the past, had total annual sales reaching over one million boxes. Even ten years ago, the number of red and green tea imported into Russia was 300,000 to 400,000 boxes. Since the Soviet Union implemented its Five-Year Plans twice, it has only purchased tea that is cheap, causing Chinese tea to be replaced by Japan, India, and Java in the Russian market. More recently, the Soviet Union has been actively promoting domestic tea production, establishing over 50 tea plantations. Once self-sufficiency is achieved, foreign tea imports will be eliminated. Last year, Russian firms in Shanghai and Hankou only purchased over 20,000 boxes of red tea from Qimen and Ningzhou in the Hunan and Hubei provinces. Not a single leaf of green tea was imported. It is heard that the Soviet Union plans to further restrict tea imports this year, with a limit of only 500,000 gold rubles, a reduction of six-tenths compared to the past. Metal Hardware: Tinplate Shortage. The shortage of 24-gauge tinplate has been reported in this newspaper. To date, new goods have still not arrived, causing concerns of stockouts in the market. The current price is 200 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan from before. It is heard that yarn factories are deeply concerned about running out of stock. Yesterday, another four boxes were purchased. 90-Pound English Tinplate Out of Stock. Recently, 90-pound English tinplate has suddenly run out of stock in the market. Therefore, factories and customers that need this product are unable to purchase it and express their regret. It is heard that the next batch of new goods</p>
